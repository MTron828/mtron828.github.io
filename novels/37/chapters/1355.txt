Chapter 1356: Terrifying Sweetie

Translator: CKtalon

Just as Zhou Wen was ruminating over the problem, Sweetie walked over from afar. She wore a guilty expression, and he could even see tiny breadcrumbs staining the corner of her mouth.

Seeing Zhou Wen look at the corner of her mouth, Sweetie seemed to realize something. She reached out and quickly wiped the corner of her mouth as she said, “Why are you looking at me?”

“Nothing. I just found you a little familiar all of a sudden.” Zhou Wen compared Sweetie’s appearance to the legendary God and really couldn’t find any similarities between the two.

“I’ve never seen you before,” Sweetie said immediately.

“Mm, that’s alright. It’s time for us to continue on our way.” Zhou Wen felt mixed emotions.

According to The Thearch, as long as he touched Sweetie, there was almost no chance of survival. If he accidentally touched her along the way, wouldn’t he be doomed?

Thinking of the golden statues that had strangely appeared in the capital, Zhou Wen had already guessed what had happened.

The most terrifying thing was that if he took Sweetie back, it would be even more troublesome if the people around him touched her.

No, I can’t return to Luoyang before resolving this problem.?Zhou Wen frowned as he thought to himself.?But if I don’t return to Luoyang, where can I go? With Sweetie around, it’s not safe for me to go anywhere… Wait…

Zhou Wen’s eyes suddenly lit up as he thought to himself,?The Thearch described Sweetie so well. She seems to be afraid of her. What will happen if I take Sweetie to Chess Mountain?

He couldn’t suppress this thought in his mind once he had it.

Zhou Wen didn’t know how powerful The Thearch was, nor did he know how powerful Sweetie was. He couldn’t predict what would happen if the two of them met.

As Zhou Wen thought about it, he turned to look at Sweetie with mixed feelings. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Sweetie felt a little nervous. She thought that her mouth was still stained with breadcrumbs, so she hurriedly wiped it again. She deliberately turned to Zhou Wen’s other side and avoided his gaze.

Zhou Wen hesitated when he saw Sweetie’s expression.

Sweetie really didn’t look like God. She was clearly a little girl.

I’ll figure out if she’s God first.?Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment and didn’t immediately head for Chess Mountain.

“By the way, I still don’t know your name?” Zhou Wen deliberately asked.

“I…” Sweetie said before pausing. Although her disguise was full of flaws, she didn’t think so herself. She believed that she couldn’t say that she was Sweetie. Furthermore, she wasn’t good at lying. She couldn’t think of an answer and was stunned.

“I know your name,” Zhou Wen suddenly said when she didn’t answer.

“What do you know?” Sweetie jumped in fright as she looked at Zhou Wen nervously.

“You’re so cute and beautiful like an angel, so your name must be related to an angel, right?” Zhou Wen said.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Sweetie immediately heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “Angels aren’t cute. They have cold faces like puppets… Not entirely… A few of them are rather interesting…”

“Which ones?” Zhou Wen continued asking, his heart sinking.

Angels were usually considered apostles of God. The more Sweetie knew about angels, the higher the possibility of her being God.

“Lu…” Sweetie had just said a syllable when she suddenly became alarmed. She glared at Zhou Wen and said, “Why should I tell you?”

“Just a casual chat. It’s fine if you don’t want to say. However, aren’t you a ghost? How do you know about angels? Ghosts and angels are natural enemies, right?” Zhou Wen deliberately asked.

“Can’t I have heard stories about them?” Sweetie didn’t know how to lie, but she couldn’t tell the truth either. She shouted angrily out of embarrassment.

Zhou Wen smiled and didn’t say anything else. He kept walking and stopping along the way. It didn’t seem like he was traveling, but like he was having a holiday.

“I don’t like these. Help me throw them away.” Every time they ate, Sweetie could only watch from the side. After eating, he would give her some of her favorite food.

It was easy to see through Sweetie. Everything she liked and disliked was written all over her face.

“It’s such a waste. You will go to hell for that.” Although Sweetie said that, she was secretly delighted.?Thankfully, he’s such a wasteful person.

Every time Sweetie secretly hid to eat, Zhou Wen would receive a message.

Up to now, no one had found any western mythical figures who liked to eat desserts. There were a few demons, but they weren’t at the required levels. It was naturally impossible for them to be Sweetie’s true identity.

“Young Master, the matter with the Heavenly Robe has been settled. In a few days, it will be time to take action.” An Sheng sent a message.

“Can you wait a little longer?” Zhou Wen didn’t dare take Sweetie back to Luoyang.

“This matter has already been set in motion. It won’t be easy to stop. I can only give it a try to stall for a few more days,” An Sheng replied.

“Alright, try your best to stall for a few days and maintain contact. If you really can’t stall any longer, tell me.” Zhou Wen also knew that such matters couldn’t be stopped just like that.

After discussing with An Sheng for a while, Zhou Wen sent messages while paying attention to Sweetie.

Although he couldn’t precisely sense Sweetie’s location, he could determine where she was and what she was doing through the changes in his surroundings.

After all, anyone who saw such a beautiful blonde girl would take a few more glances, allowing Zhou Wen to determine what Sweetie was doing.

A youth’s eyes lit up when he saw Sweetie by the side of the road. He walked to her and said, “Why is such a beautiful girl squatting by the side and eating alone? Are you homeless? Follow me. I guarantee that you won’t have to worry about food and clothes.”

Sweetie ignored him and turned to leave.

When the youth saw that he had been ignored, he was immediately infuriated. He reached out and grabbed Sweetie’s shoulder. At the same time, he said coldly, “Who let you leave? In West Song City, no one dares to not give me, Ximen Leng…”

As he spoke, his fingers had already touched the clothes on Sweetie’s shoulder. A golden light immediately lit up at his fingertips like a lit match.

Almost instantly, the youth’s body turned into gold amidst the golden light. He still maintained the stance of extending his hand and speaking.

Zhou Wen stared at this scene and felt his heart turn cold. Although he had already guessed it, he was still extremely shocked to see it with his own eyes.

Ximen Leng was likely at the Mythical stage after using the Mythical Serum. He was considered a top-notch expert among humans, but just by touching Sweetie’s clothes, he turned into gold.

Now, Zhou Wen was very glad that he hadn’t touched Sweetie before.
