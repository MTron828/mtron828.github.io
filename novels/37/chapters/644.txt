Chapter 645: Scream Loudly If You Are In Pain

“If we have to continue being tortured like this, I’m afraid we will be dead long before we can finish all the punishments.” Zhou Wen looked at Chu He and asked, “Professor Chu, other than being punished, is there any other way to obtain steps? Previously, when we came, we encountered some dimensional creatures. Would they leave anything special after they die?”

Chu He shook his head firmly and said, “There’s no other way. Only by being tortured in the torture chamber can one obtain more steps.”

Zhou Wen turned his head and looked at the long street. Apart from them, the others had entered the torture chambers to be punished.

It was a pity that he couldn’t hear anything beyond ten steps. Otherwise, he would definitely be able to hear the undulating screams.

“Junior Brother, do you want to give punishment by a thousand cuts a try as well? Perhaps you can last longer than me?” Liu Yun encouraged him. He wanted to see how long Zhou Wen could last under such torture.

“I think I’ll forget about it.” Zhou Wen shook his head and looked around. He planned on attempting a less severe punishment.

Although they could enter the torture chamber directly without needing to walk over, they needed to be within ten steps of one. If the torture chamber was too far from them, they wouldn’t be able to undergo the punishment.

Now, there was only one torture chamber to their left and right that were within ten steps away On the left was the punishment by a thousand cuts which Liu Yun had attempted.

On the right was punishment by whipping. On it stated a step per lash.

It was similar to punishment by a thousand cuts. One was hoisted up for the punishment. However, it wasn’t the slicing of flesh but lashing with a whip.

Liu Yun was also looking at the whip. Seeing that it was a vine whip, he said, “Then let me try the punishment. My body is quite tough. I should be able to withstand it a few more times.”

With that said, Liu Yun shouted at the whipping torture chamber, “I want to undertake punishment by whipping.”

Just like the last time, Liu Yun’s body vanished. He was hung in the whipping torture chamber. Then, a white ghost-like figure appeared and picked up the vine whip.

The vine whip was lashed out by the white figure. Sharp spikes appeared on the originally smooth whip, making it appear like a thorny vine.

Pa! With a crisp sound, a bloody whip mark appeared on Liu Yun’s body.

After a few whips, Liu Yun’s body was reduced to a bloody mess. It was even more terrifying than punishment by a thousand cuts.

This time, Liu Yun only held on for about ten whips before giving up. After being released, he looked a little shriveled.

“F*ck, this isn’t giving us a way out. How can humans withstand such punishment? Death by punishment, death also by not undergoing punishment. Why should we be punished!?” Liu Yun cursed.

“I’ll give it a try too.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and shouted at the whipping torture chamber, “I want to undertake punishment by whipping.”

The moment he finished his sentence, Zhou Wen felt his vision blur. His body seemed to be teleported by some force. By the time he reacted, he was already hung up in the whipping chamber.

A white ghost appeared in front of him. It had already gripped the vine whip.

“Junior Brother, scream loudly if you are in pain. Don’t endure it. The more you endure, the more painful it will be. It will be much better if you shout out loud. The louder you shout, the better,” Liu Yun said gloatingly.

He was actually just trying to find pleasure amidst the suffering, hoping to reduce his stress. He didn’t really want to hear Zhou Wen scream.

“Alright,” Zhou Wen replied as he switched his Essence Energy Art to Dao Body and Gods Retreat before closing his eyes.

However, the Gods Retreat Life Providence didn’t affect the white ghost. Clearly, the punishment in the torture chamber wasn’t a taboo power.

Seeing that Gods Retreat was useless, Zhou Wen hurriedly switched to Small Perfection of Wisdom. At the same time, he activated the Hell King Life Soul. Under the effects of the Hell King Life Soul, Zhou Wen’s control over his body was extremely strong. Not only did his physique strengthen, but he could also eliminate the pain.

No matter how serious his injuries were, Zhou Wen wouldn’t feel any pain. It was as though his pain nerves had been removed.

Zhou Wen didn’t plan on constantly being punished. All he wanted to do was try out the force of the whipping punishment.

However, just as Zhou Wen used the Hell King Life Soul, the white specter that had already lashed out suddenly retracted its whip without striking.

“Junior Brother, what’s going on? Don’t tell me you can’t even withstand a whip and are giving up?” Liu Yun said when he saw the scene before him, imagining that Zhou Wen had given up.

However, what happened next left Liu Yun’s mouth agape.

The white ghost with the whip actually plopped to the ground and kowtowed. It lay prone, trembling.

Crack!

The shackles that bound Zhou Wen’s hands automatically opened, allowing him to land.

However, Zhou Wen hadn’t given up on being tortured, so he didn’t return to the long street. Instead, he landed in the whipping chamber. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

His feet landed on the ground, but there were no numbers on the floor. Perhaps it was because the steps didn’t count in the torture chambers.

“Junior Brother... What’s going on...” Liu Yun stared at Zhou Wen with his mouth agape as he looked at the trembling white ghost in front of Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen never expected his Hell King Life Soul to have such an effect.

Looking at the white ghost sprawled on the ground, Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before saying to it, “Stand up.”

The white ghost was very obedient. It obediently stood up, but its body was still trembling. It looked extremely frightened.

“Don’t be afraid. Come, whip me,” Zhou Wen said gently to the white ghost.

The white ghost trembled again as it collapsed to the ground and kowtowed to Zhou Wen.

“Stand up. I order you to whip me,” Zhou Wen said coldly to the white ghost.

The white ghost crawled up trembling as it held the whip in its hand, but it didn’t dare to whip Zhou Wen.

“It’s fine. I’m giving you permission to whip me, but you have to whip me gently. Just gently touch me,” Zhou Wen instructed the white ghost.

The white ghost held the whip, but it didn’t dare attack. Zhou Wen glared at it before it finally flung the whip and struck Zhou Wen’s body.

The whip whistled through the air, but it only touched Zhou Wen’s clothes and immediately retracted. Zhou Wen felt his skin being touched by his clothes. There was no pain at all.

The white ghost was terrified. It sprawled on the ground and kowtowed again.

“You did well. That’s right. Do it again. Lash me a few more times,” Zhou Wen encouraged.

Only then did the white ghost stand up shakily and lashed at Zhou Wen’s body again. Just like before, it retracted once the whip touched his clothes.

Zhou Wen found a spot to sit down. As he took out his phone, he got the white ghost to torture him.

“This spot... A little heavier here... My shoulders are a little sore... Strike this side... Use more strength...” Zhou Wen kept directing the white ghost to attack the various parts of his body.

“Seriously?” Liu Yun and Chu He were dumbfounded.

The originally terrifying atmosphere was now gone. The white ghost held the vine whip and served Zhou Wen like it was a masseur at a massage parlor.
