Chapter 931: New Era

The snake monster was stopped by the scallop, but the ice maiden rushed over. An ice beam descended at an unbelievable speed. Zhou Wen had already pushed Transcendent Flying Immortal to its limits, but he still couldn’t dodge it.

After all, Zhou Wen was only at the Epic stage; just his stats alone were much weaker.

He had no choice but to use his teleportation ability again. However, he didn’t have many teleportation attempts left. It was impossible for him to last long.

He wanted to teleport to the bottom of the sea to see if he could use Earth Escape, but the ice maiden seemed to see through his thoughts. When the ice beam shone at the bottom of the sea, it immediately turned a large area of the sea into ice. It didn’t give Zhou Wen a chance to touch the sand and rocks.

Zhou Wen retreated as he fought. The number of teleportations in the Civilized Country was decreasing, and now there were only two left.

When Zhou Wen had no choice but to use teleportation again, he suddenly felt the energy in Civilized Country explode. At that moment, Civilized Country advanced.

Zhou Wen was overjoyed as the ghost-faced ring underwent a new change. The half-evil and half-beautiful ghost face underwent a strange change. The ugly half became extremely handsome, while the handsome half became abnormally ugly. The gears in his eyes also spun in the opposite direction.

At the same time, the evolved information of Civilized Country entered Zhou Wen’s mind. Although the information was very vague and wasn’t as clear as the annotations in-game, he could roughly understand its functions.

The evolved Life Soul of the Civilized Country was called New Era. The detailed abilities were unknown, but he could sense that the number of times he could use instantaneous transmission had increased. Zhou Wen didn’t know how many times he could use it, but it was definitely more than ten.

Great!

Zhou Wen watched as the ice maiden shot out another ice beam. Having nowhere to retreat, Zhou Wen used his teleportation ability again.

This teleportation distance was much further than before. Furthermore, he didn’t sense the energy of the New Era Life Soul dissipate. From the looks of it, he could use it many more times.

Zhou Wen constantly teleported in an attempt to shake off the ice maiden, but he quickly realized that it was impossible to shake her off in the sea. She actually had a Water Escape skill that allowed her to appear and disappear in the sea, allowing her to teleport kilometers.

Zhou Wen suspected that the reason the ice castle changed from the volcanic area to the sea was because the ice maiden had previously rung the bell. He also tried to ring the bell in his hand, but no matter how he shook it, the bell wouldn’t ring.

Thinking back to when the ice maiden rang the bell, she had entered her Terror form. Thinking that this bell could only be used at the Terror grade, he had no choice but to give up on using it.

He teleported to the surface of the sea and the ice maiden chased after him.

After the snake monster shook off the scallop, it chased after him. Seeing that the ice maiden was still chasing Zhou Wen and wasn’t shaken off, it heaved a sigh of relief and quickly chased after them.

Zhou Wen used teleportation repeatedly in the sky and had once distanced himself from the ice maiden, but as long as he stopped, she would quickly catch up to him.

Zhou Wen guessed that the ice maiden had a special method to sense the bell. Unless he threw the bell away, it was almost impossible to shake her off.

Although he could teleport multiple times with New Era, it wasn’t infinite. Zhou Wen knew that it would be used up sooner or later. He had to find a way to escape before that happened.

After some thought, Zhou Wen continuously teleported, distancing himself from the ice maiden before rushing into the sea.

Zhou Wen’s luck wasn’t bad. He saw a group of dimensional creatures that had just spewed out of a spring. Most of them were at the Mortal stage, and he occasionally saw a few at the Legendary stage.

Now, these creatures were what Zhou Wen needed. He rushed over and used the Eye of Legacy to scan a Mortal-stage Golden Scaled Fish.

As it was a Mortal creature, the scanning time was very short. In the blink of an eye, Zhou Wen became a Golden-Scaled Fish that mixed with the school of Golden-Scaled Fish.

Unfortunately, the bell couldn’t be stored in the Chaos Bead. After Zhou Wen transformed, the bell hung on his fin.

“Where did he go?” The snake monster caught up and asked when it saw the ice maiden stop.

“It’s right below. He wants to do the same thing again, so I feigned ignorance and didn’t chase after him. I waited for you to come over and capture him together to prevent him from escaping again,” the ice maiden said.

The snake monster immediately understood what she meant and asked, “He became a snow cat again?”

“He’s not a snow cat, but a Gold Scaled Fish,” the ice maiden said. “His transformation technique is somewhat strange. Even I can’t tell what dimensional creature he has transformed into. If he didn’t have the Heaven Shrouding Bell on him, it would have been very difficult to find him.”

“Where is he? We have to quickly snatch the Heaven Shrouding Bell back to prevent any accidents from happening,” said the snake monster.

“Alright, we’ll surround him from both sides and prevent him from escaping.” The ice maiden pointed at Zhou Wen and said, “The Heaven Shrouding Bell is on him. Take a closer look and you will be able to tell which one is him.”

With that said, the ice maiden rushed into the sea from one side while the snake monster entered from another side to do a pincer attack.

When Zhou Wen saw the ice maiden and the snake monster plunge down, he knew that his transformation technique was useless. He immediately wanted to escape.

However, the snake monster didn’t give him a chance. Wind blades sliced through the sea and enveloped Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to switch his Life Soul and use teleportation again to dodge the snake monster’s attack. However, just as he teleported, he saw the ice maiden in front of him. An ice beam shone down.

Now, it wasn’t a matter of teleportation. He was too close to the ice maiden and the ice beam was too fast. Zhou Wen’s reaction couldn’t keep up.

However, thanks to his intuition cultivated from prolonged combat, Zhou Wen still used teleportation to dodge the strike. However, when he teleported out, he felt his head, hands, and legs being grabbed by someone as though he was wearing iron chains.

Zhou Wen was alarmed. The person who had grabbed him was the snake monster with six arms. The hands at the top grabbed Zhou Wen’s head, while the hands in the middle grabbed his wrists. The hands at the bottom grabbed Zhou Wen’s feet. His expression was extremely ferocious as though he was a devil from hell, about to tear Zhou Wen’s body into six pieces.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used Doctor Darkness’s Dark Right Hand. His right hand suddenly turned into nothingness and escaped the snake monster’s control. He stabbed it into its head, hoping to pluck its brain out. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Zhou Wen realized that his idea was a little too idealistic. Only a Terror-grade could defeat a Terror-grade. This was definitely not a joke. The Wheel of Destiny power of the Darkness Right Hand had actually penetrated the snake monster’s head, but it failed to extract his brain.

The brain was like a bull’s tendon; Zhou Wen had no way of pulling it.

However, Zhou Wen’s actions made the snake monster cry out in pain. At the same time, he turned extremely furious as he exerted strength with his other five hands, hoping to tear Zhou Wen apart.
