Chapter 827: Yun Niu

Translator: CKtalon

“This is Zhou Wen’s adopted child,” Tian Xiangdong said when he saw that it was Yun Niu.

Yun Niu was a freshman who had just joined the Xuanwen Club. Zhou Wen had never met him before.

“Ah, so it’s the famous Senior Zhou’s child. I didn’t expect him to be extremely talented in cultivation and very caring. He’s both morally and technically good.” As Yun Niu spoke, he went forward to pinch Ya’er’s face. “This child is really cute. What’s her name?”

However, Ya’er took two steps back and dodged Yun Niu’s hand.

“This child is afraid of strangers. Don’t scare her,” Fang Ruoxi pulled Ya’er back and said to Yun Niu.

“Children should be more lively. Once they start seeing more people, they naturally won’t be afraid.” As Yun Niu spoke, he searched his body and took out a handful of candies from his pocket. “Come, these candies are high quality stuff. They are delicious. Call me uncle and I’ll give them all to you.”

Ya’er only looked at Yun Niu silently.

Seeing that Ya’er wasn’t moved, Yun Niu peeled a piece of candy and placed it in its mouth to chew. As he chewed, he said, “It’s fragrant and sweet. This piece is for you. Try it first.”

However, Ya’er didn’t reach out to take it. She continued to look at him expressionlessly.

“What’s wrong with this child?” Yun Niu frowned slightly. He had seen many children, but none of them were like Ya’er.

Some introverted and timid children would show some expression even if they didn’t dare to take it or were frightened by him. They wouldn’t be so expressionless.

However, Ya’er was clearly not afraid of him. She looked at him but ignored him.

“Don’t you like candy? I still have many treasures here. Let’s see if you like them.” Yun Niu opened his backpack and took out a rattle drum, a small pistol, a doll, a bell, and other toys. He placed them on the table one by one.

“Look at how fun this is. Here you go.” Yun Niu shook the rattle drum in front of Ya’er.

However, Ya’er still looked at him and had no intention of reaching out to take it.

“Is this child deaf and mute?” Yun Niu asked gloomily.

“What do you mean by deaf and mute? She’s young and can’t even speak. By the way, why do you have so many children’s toys on you? Where did you get them?” Tian Xiangdong asked.

“I bought this. I’m planning on taking it back for my niece to play during the holidays. However, it looks like these things can’t attract a little girl,” Yun Niu said in frustration.

“I never expected you to be so meticulous. You actually have your niece on your mind,” Tian Xiangdong said with a smile.

“I just didn’t know what to buy, so I bought a little of everything. It looks like it won’t work.” As he spoke, Tian Xiangdong picked up the toys and handed them to Ya’er. “How about this? Do you like this?”

Yun Niu tried many things, but Ya’er didn’t react.

Just as Yun Niu was giving up hope, Ya’er suddenly pointed at Yun Niu’s backpack.

Yun Niu was delighted. “What do you want? Uncle will give it to you.”

Ya’er still pointed at the backpack with her tiny hand. Yun Niu poured out all the things inside and said to Ya’er, “Which one do you like? Take it yourself.”

Ya’er reached out and grabbed something. When Yun Niu saw what Ya’er was grabbing, he couldn’t help but be slightly stunned. “Strange, why is that thing in the backpack? Could it be that it was accidentally stuffed inside when I was putting things in?”

“This...” Yun Niu wanted to stop Ya’er, but after some thought, he allowed Ya’er to grab it.

It was a necklace with many rubies embedded in it. It looked very beautiful.

Although the value of gems wasn’t as expensive as before, this necklace was clearly a high-quality item. Before the dimensional storms, it could probably have been sold for hundreds of millions.

Even now, it was probably worth some money. After all, such gemstones were still very rare.

“A girl is a girl. They know beauty from a young age. She chose such a beautiful necklace. Yun Niu, is this necklace real?” Tian Xiangdong asked.

“How can it be real? It’s a replica. If she likes it, let her play with it,” Yun Niu said.

“That’s good.” Fang Ruoxi pulled Ya’er to the side and said, “Ya’er, I’ll put it on for you.”

Ya’er released her hand. After Fang Ruoxi took the necklace, she put it on Ya’er’s neck and said, “Ya’er, you’re so beautiful.”

However, Ya’er didn’t react. She wore the necklace and remained expressionless, as if she was facially paralyzed.

Yun Niu took out a pearl necklace from the toys and said to Ya’er, “Is the necklace nice? Do you still want it? Uncle has something even more beautiful. Let Uncle hug you and I’ll give you a lot of beautiful jewelry.”

However, Ya’er remained unmoved. She turned her head to the side as if she was impatient with him.

The corners of Yun Niu’s eyes twitched as he thought to himself, Alright, you ingrate. You’re turning your back on me after taking my stuff.

However, no matter how Yun Niu coaxed her, she ignored him.

“Yun Niu, it looks like you aren’t very popular with children. Stop teasing her,” Tian Xiangdong said.

“It looks like that’s the case.” Yun Niu nodded, but he suddenly reached out and forcefully picked up Ya’er.

“Yun Niu, don’t do that. You’ll scare Ya’er.” Fang Ruoxi frowned and was about to take Ya’er back.

Yun Niu took two steps back and with a poof, his body emitted white smoke. When the smoke dissipated, Yun Niu and Ya’er were gone.

“Tell Zhou Wen that if he wants this girl to live, he has to come to Mount Dragon Tiger alone.” A voice sounded, but there was no sign of him.

Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong’s expressions changed drastically as they quickly rushed out. However, there was no sign of Yun Niu or Ya’er. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Zhou Wen happened to walk over at this moment. Tian Xiangdong immediately said, “Zhou Wen, bad news. Ya’er has been abducted...”

Fang Ruoxi said anxiously, “Let’s chase after him. He shouldn’t have escaped the campus grounds yet.”

“There’s no need to chase. We won’t be able to catch up. That person’s name is Yun Niu?” Zhou Wen had already seen the development. He was afraid that something would happen to Ya’er, so he kept using Truth Listener to monitor her.

Zhou Wen had seen everything that had happened in the activity room. However, he never expected Yun Niu to suddenly pull off such a trick. Even he didn’t have the time to stop him.

“Yes, his name is Yun Niu. He’s a freshman. He just joined the club not long ago. I never expected... Zhou Wen, I’m sorry... I’ll go with you to Mount Dragon Tiger. No matter what, I have to save Ya’er.” Fang Ruoxi felt terrible. Zhou Wen had requested that she take care of Ya’er, but someone had abducted Ya’er under her nose.

“There’s no need. I know who took away Ya’er. It’s fine. Don’t blame yourself. Even the six families couldn’t stop him from stealing something, much less you,” Zhou Wen said.
