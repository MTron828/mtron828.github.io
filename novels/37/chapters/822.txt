Chapter 823: Devourer

The pocket universe formed by the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art wasn’t as complicated as the Endless Sea of Stars. It lacked a portion of the details, but the general outline was the same.

Zhou Wen explored the Endless Sea of Stars as he grinded. Through his observations of the Endless Sea of Stars, he gained insight into the profundity of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art.

Since Zhou Wen wanted to search for Astral Combat Beasts in the Endless Sea of Stars, it wasn’t considered a waste of time.

He had been too busy recently, so Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to grind the Lunar Mansion skills and Astral Combat Beasts. The twenty-eight Lunar Mansion Skills were still lacking three key skills, so the Star Stealer’s Essence Energy Skill Crystal hadn’t dropped.

Now was the perfect opportunity to explore the Endless Sea of Stars and find Astral Combat Beasts.

Zhou Wen roamed the Endless Sea of Stars and watched the stellar transposition. Every time he gained some insight, the tiny universe in his body would become more similar to the Endless Sea of Stars.

Zhou Wen had a vague feeling that when his pocket universe became identical to the Endless Sea of Stars, it would be the time he condensed his Life Providence.

The Endless Sea of Stars wasn’t just limited to the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions. Outside the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions covered a large area. Zhou Wen killed countless Astral Beasts along the way, but he didn’t find any Astral Combat Beasts.

In fact, there were very few Mythical Astral Beasts. Most of them were between the Mortal and Epic stage.

Just as he was feeling puzzled, he suddenly saw something flash in the cosmos ahead.

When Zhou Wen focused, he didn’t discover anything.

Were my eyes playing tricks on me?

Zhou Wen took a closer look and still didn’t discover anything. He couldn’t help but find it odd.

Suddenly, something flashed in the cosmos. Zhou Wen only saw a flash, but he didn’t see what it was.

However, when Zhou Wen looked carefully at the spot where the figure was flickering, he immediately felt his scalp tingle. This was because a planet that was originally there had vanished. When he confirmed that there was nothing there, he clearly saw a planet.

Devourer! Zhou Wen immediately thought of something.

Previously, when he had gone to the Endless Sea of Stars in real life, Zhou Wen had seen a Devourer. However, the Devourer back then looked like a jellyfish in a lake. It ate planets like eating candy, so it didn’t feel too shocking.

However, now that he was in the Endless Sea of Stars, it was somewhat different. Although the planet was much smaller than the planets in real life, it was still as huge as a mountain. It was truly shocking to see it disappear.

What was even more terrifying was that Zhou Wen didn’t see the Devourer in-game. He only saw something flash when it devoured the planet.

Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and raised Truth Listener’s ability to its limits to monitor the nearby area.

Soon, he realized that a nearby planet had been devoured, and he finally saw the Devourer.

With Truth Listener’s ability, Zhou Wen outlined the appearance of the Devourer in his mind, but he still couldn’t see it with his eyes.

It was similar to what Zhou Wen had seen in real life—a transparent jellyfish-like monster. However, its size was far more exaggerated in-game. It directly swallowed the entire planet; the smaller planets in the Endless Sea of Stars were about the size of a bean.

This body is much bigger than Tyrant Behemoth after its transformation! When Zhou Wen looked at it, the Devourer had already wandered over.

Zhou Wen ordered the gigantic Tyrant Behemoth to charge forward, hoping to see how powerful the Devourer was.

After receiving Zhou Wen’s order, Tyrant Behemoth activated Absolute Strength and pounced over.

The Devourer was really like a jellyfish. The countless tentacles below shook as its body rose at an unbelievable speed, dodging Tyrant Behemoth’s attacks.

After Tyrant Behemoth struck, it didn’t continue pursuing. It stood there in a daze.

Zhou Wen immediately understood. He could see the Devourer with Truth Listener, but Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t. It naturally couldn’t attack enemies it couldn’t see.

Zhou Wen commanded Tyrant Behemoth to fight, but Tyrant Behemoth relied on its instincts to fight. With Zhou Wen commanding it, there was a delay.

Before long, the Devourer swallowed Tyrant Behemoth’s body.

It was unknown what the Devourer’s body was made of. Tyrant Behemoth, which possessed Absolute Strength, failed to escape after being swallowed.

This is really troublesome. Tyrant Behemoth can’t see it, so it’s disadvantageous in battle. Furthermore, if it can’t be seen, Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World will be useless. I’ll probably have to rely on Truth Listener to kill the Devourer. Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Overlord Sword and relied on Truth Listener’s ability to lock onto the Devourer’s position. He gathered all his strength and used Immortal Slaying to slash at the Devourer without holding back.

However, in the next second, Zhou Wen felt the blood-colored avatar’s body sink into a vortex before the phone screen went black.

GAME OVER!

Devourer is amazing. Tyrant Behemoth and Torch Dragon probably can’t do anything about it. The only one who can fight it is probably Truth Listener. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and realized that he didn’t have a good solution to deal with the Devourer.

However, the danger of Truth Listener removing multiple earrings was too high. If it only removed one or two, it probably wouldn’t be enough to kill the Devourer.

He once again entered the Endless Sea of Stars. This time, Zhou Wen circled around the area. He couldn’t think of a way to kill the Devourer for the moment, so he ignored it and strolled through the Endless Sea of Stars to condense the Life Providence of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art.

However, the Devourer’s whereabouts was unpredictable. Zhou Wen had already circled around it, but to his surprise, it would appear in different star systems. Every time Zhou Wen wanted to escape, he was devoured by its black hole-like power.

The only time Zhou Wen ran away was when he used the long-distance teleportation skill of Civilized Country to reach a spot where the Devourer couldn’t see him. However, he was eventually found and killed by the Devourer.

At first, Zhou Wen imagined that it was a problem with the respawning of the game. Every time he respawned the Devourer would be in a different star system, but with repeated dying, Zhou Wen began to suspect something. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Every time I enter the Endless Sea of Stars, as long as I leave the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions, I will encounter it at about the same time. This definitely isn’t as simple as a random respawn. Could it be that the Devourer has the ability to teleport? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised when he thought of this possibility.

He didn’t have much hope of obtaining the Mystic Bird. If the Devourer also had spatial teleportation abilities, he could attempt to kill it. If a Companion Egg dropped, perhaps the problem of advancing Civilized Country would be resolved.
