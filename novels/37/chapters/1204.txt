Chapter 1205: Ancient Sovereign Battles Asura

Translator: CKtalon

An Tianzuo had already slashed out with all his might with the broken sword in his left hand, almost shaving a piece off Xiao, but he ultimately failed to kill him.

If An Tianzuo still had both his hands, he could smash the bloody Xiao into meat paste with one palm. Unfortunately, An Tianzuo only had one hand left.

Even so, An Tianzuo had no intention of retreating as he stood there like a mountain and looked into Xiao’s blood-stained eyes.

The blood that spewed out of Xiao’s body seemed to have a life of its own as it charged towards An Tianzuo. The bloody Xiao was like a blood-colored devil. Its ferocity made one shudder.

An Tianzuo didn’t retreat. At the instant Xiao slammed into him, An Tianzuo headbutted Xiao’s head.

Bam!

The two unreserved Terror powers collided as Xiao’s head exploded. After his bloody body slammed into An Tianzuo, he was sent retreating. Blood splattered everywhere, no longer able to cling on to Xiao’s ravaged body.

The machine armor on An Tianzuo’s head shattered as his forehead kept bleeding. However, he ultimately guarded the Asura Realm’s exit and didn’t take a step back.

Seeing Xiao’s corpse fall, An Tianzuo’s expression suddenly changed. He immediately turned to look at the Asura Realm’s exit and saw a drop of blood that had spewed out of Xiao’s body falling towards the door.

An Tianzuo drew his sword and slashed, but he was still a step too late. The drop of blood landed on the door like a stone thrown into a lake, causing spatial ripples to appear before it vanished.

...

Li Xuan, Lu Bushun, An Jingyu, and company waited beyond the Bridge of Helplessness.

“Why aren’t Overseer and the rest out after so long?” Lu Bushun’s fat body paced around without stopping.

“Can you stop pacing around? My head is spinning from watching you,” Li Xuan said.

“What has your dizziness got to do with me? That’s because your kidney is weak,” Lu Bushun retorted.

“Get out of the way!” Just as Li Xuan was about to say something, he suddenly heard a loud shout.

Lu Bushun and company immediately recognized An Tianzuo’s voice. All of them stood up warily and looked in the direction of the Bridge of Helplessness.

However, they didn’t see anything. There was nothing on the Bridge of Helplessness.

Li Xuan saw An Tianzuo rush out of the Bridge of Helplessness. At the same time, he saw a drop of blood shoot towards Lu Bushun at an unbelievable speed.

Li Xuan didn’t have the time to completely turn into his Terror form. All he could do was Terror transform his palm and block Lu Bushun’s forehead.

Bam!

The drop of blood penetrated Li Xuan’s Terror-form palm like a bullet.

Thankfully, with Li Xuan blocking him, he bought Lu Bushun time. The latter’s reaction was fast enough. He did a roll as the drop of blood brushed past his head.

In midair, the drop of blood took Xiao’s form. Sucking two officers towards him, each of his hands grabbed one by the head. If he were to exert a little more force, their heads would explode.

“An Tianzuo, take another step and I’ll crush their heads,” Xiao said calmly.

An Tianzuo stopped. He knew that Xiao wasn’t joking. A person like him didn’t bluff.

“Overseer, don’t worry about us.” The two officers struggled with all their might, but they were like chickens. No matter how they struggled, they couldn’t escape the butcher’s hands.

“An Tianzuo, what do you say?” Xiao narrowed his eyes as he looked at An Tianzuo.

“Let them go and you can leave,” An Tianzuo said.

Without a word, Xiao released his hand, but he didn’t leave immediately.

The officers surrounded Xiao, but An Tianzuo said indifferently, “Let him go.”

“As expected of An Tianzuo. I hope I can truly determine the outcome of the battle with you another time,” Xiao said as he reached out and grabbed at the air. A wisp of black gas rushed out from the heads of the two officers he had grabbed and landed in Xiao’s palm before disappearing.

“See you again,” Xiao said to An Tianzuo. When he turned around, he glanced at Li Xuan before flying away and disappearing in the blink of an eye.

“Overseer, who was he?” Lu Bushun said in shock. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“An enemy, try your best to avoid him the next time you encounter him.” An Tianzuo glanced in the direction Xiao had left as though in thought.

An Tianzuo didn’t chase after him, knowing that he couldn’t catch up no matter how hard he tried.

“Li Xuan, do you know that person?” An Tianzuo finally cast his gaze on Li Xuan.

“He wore a mask, so I didn’t recognize him. However, if I knew such a powerful fellow, I would have an impression of him, but I have none,” Li Xuan said.

“That’s strange,” An Tianzuo said after some thought.

Li Xuan knew that An Tianzuo implied that the matter was likely related to him, so he asked, “What’s strange?”

An Tianzuo looked at Li Xuan and said, “These people know our An family very well. They should know that our family values Jingyu very much. In that situation, his best choice of hostages should have been Jingyu and you, but he didn’t do that. Instead, he chose to distance himself and abducted two officers that even he might not know. This clearly goes against common sense.”

Everyone felt that it made sense when they heard that. In that situation, anyone would have targeted An Jingyu, followed by Li Xuan—who was physically closest to An Jingyu.

“Perhaps he knows how powerful I am and saw that An Jingyu was too close to me, so he didn’t dare attack him?” Li Xuan also agreed with An Tianzuo’s speculation.

“His goal was very clear. It wasn’t you from the beginning, but Lu Bushun. You only used your Terror powers after the target was chosen. Your advancement to the Terror grade happened in Netherworld City, so it was impossible for them to know about that, much less avoid you from the beginning. It still doesn’t make sense,” An Tianzuo said with a shake of his head.

“I’m stumped. I really don’t know that person,” Li Xuan said as he spread out his hands.

“Yes.” An Tianzuo nodded and didn’t say anything else as he frowned.

“Overseer, where are Young Master Wen, Adjutant An, and company? Do we need to help them?” Lu Bushun asked.

“There’s no need. Just wait here for them to return.” An Tianzuo didn’t return to the Asura Realm. Firstly, he was afraid that Xiao would return, and secondly, he was confident in Zhou Wen.

...

In the Asura Realm, Zhou Wen’s body emitted a glow like a sun god. He had already fused with the Primordial Human Sovereign and was constantly transforming.

With a thought, Zhou Wen landed on the top of Great Brahma’s head. When the Asura attacked again, his fist emitted a virile glow as he struck at the Asura.

The Asura’s attack was completely blocked by Great Brahma. Zhou Wen took the opportunity to strike with his fist, leaving him no room to dodge.

Zhou Wen’s punch struck the chest of the spirit-like Asura body which seemed impervious to any force. A fist-sized hole melted into existence when it was struck by Zhou Wen’s punch.
