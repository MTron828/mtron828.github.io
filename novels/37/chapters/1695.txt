Chapter 1696: Blasting Apart With A Slap

“Humanoid Companion Beast? It looks so cool!”

The Truth Listener that Zhou Wen had summoned had its limiter removed with the six earrings. It appeared in the Star Palace in its human form. Its handsome and wild appearance immediately attracted the attention of many people.

Even in this era where Calamity creatures were common, humanoid Companion Beasts were still extremely rare.

Before anyone could carefully appreciate Truth Listener’s appearance, it instantly arrived in front of Starlord Ravenous Wolf.

Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s fist emitted light, but before he could deliver a blast of light, Truth Listener’s palm struck him to the ground along with his blast of light. It exploded as all sorts of Essence Energy Crystals dropped and fell to the ground.

Ordinary people wouldn’t be able to see the battle process, but everyone could see Truth Listener’s strike that blasted Starlord Ravenous Wolf apart. This was because its actions were so simple, direct, and without any technical content.

“Holy sh*t, what the hell is this?”

“This Companion Beast is so cool! If he were a human, I would definitely marry him.”

“To slap Starlord Ravenous Wolf to death in one strike. This Companion Beast is comparable to Karoman. It’s no wonder Human Sovereign dares to challenge the Big Dipper Palaces.”

“Holy sh*t, this Starlord Ravenous Wolf is fake, right? He’s a Calamity-grade creature after all. He was killed just like that?”

The entire world instantly broke into an uproar. Su Yi said excitedly, “As expected of Human Sovereign. Just a mere Companion Beast of his is already so powerful. I wonder how powerful he is. I really look forward to seeing him personally take action.”

Professor Gu continued, “Your anticipation might not last long. This Companion Beast is indeed extremely powerful, but it’s obvious that he’s a Strength-type melee Companion Beast. It shouldn’t be difficult to deal with Starlord Ravenous Wolf and Starlord Titan Gate, but when it comes to Starlord Cherished Kismet of the Third Star Palace, this Companion Beast will be restrained. It needs Human Sovereign to take action himself or summon a new Companion Beast.”

Amidst everyone’s discussion, Zhou Wen had already arrived at the second Star Palace with Truth Listener. Just as Professor Gu had predicted, Truth Listener effortlessly killed Starlord Titan Gate. Everyone could clearly see that Starlord Titan Gate had no means of retaliating.

“Now, I want to know how Human Sovereign will deal with Starlord Cherished Kismet. Will he do it himself or summon a new Companion Beast?” Professor Gu said.

Upon hearing Professor Gu’s explanation, everyone began to look forward to it. They were discussing if Human Sovereign should take action himself or summon a new Companion Beast.

Some people looked forward to seeing Human Sovereign’s glory, while others hoped to see him showcase more powerful Companion Beasts.

However, after Human Sovereign walked into the Cherished Kismet Palace, he didn’t summon another Companion Beast. Professor Gu said, “From the looks of it, Human Sovereign plans on taking action himself. I wonder what kind of power he will use and what strategy he will take. However, as long as Human Sovereign takes action, I can roughly tell if he advanced to the Calamity grade as a pure human…”

Before Professor Gu could finish his analysis, he saw Truth Listener blast apart Starlord Cherished Kismet with a slap.

Exploded from a slap… Exploded from a slap… Exploded from a slap…?The scene became a little odd. The professor’s eyes widened and his mouth gaped open for a long time.

Does this even f*cking make sense? Isn’t Starlord Cherished Kismet able to reflect damage? Doesn’t it have powerful recovery abilities? Isn’t it able to restrain Strength-type Companion Beasts? Isn’t it invincible when being beaten? What happened? Where am I? Who am I??Professor Gu’s mind was filled with questions.

“Haha, my Human Sovereign is awesome. There’s no such thing as strategy. There’s no need to do it himself. The Companion Beast can resolve it with a slap.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“This Companion Beast is invincible. It can even slap the opponent to death. It freaking doesn’t make sense.”

“Don’t tell me Human Sovereign will use one Companion Beast to kill all seven Starlords?”

“Awesome, Human Sovereign is mighty. I never knew that Companion Beasts could be so ferocious.”

“This is the strongest Companion Beast in the world. I won’t accept any retorts.”

Many humans had great expectations and a good impression of Human Sovereign to begin with. Truth Listener’s domineering performance instantly ignited everyone’s enthusiasm.

“Professor Gu, Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast is so powerful. Which type of Companion Beast do you think it is? Will Human Sovereign use this Companion Beast to clear the Big Dipper Palaces? If that’s the case, will his ranking have a chance of overtaking Karoman?” Su Yi was very excited as she raised several questions.

Professor Gu finally snapped to his senses and forced himself to calm down. “From the looks of it, this Companion Beast’s level should be very high. It ignores powers that are strong against the Strength stat. If nothing goes wrong, he should be able to clear the Big Dipper Palaces with a Companion Beast.”

“Professor Gu, don’t do that. I’m afraid Human Sovereign won’t be able to withstand your jinx.”

“What’s there to be afraid of? If this Companion Beast doesn’t work, Human Sovereign will definitely have other powerful Companion Beasts. It will be a feast for our eyes to see a few more.”

Everyone was delighted. In the past, they couldn’t see the battles between the other experts and the Starlords clearly. They could only watch the slow-motion analysis afterward. This was the first time they had seen it so clearly on the livestream.

Zhou Wen led Truth Listener to clear one Star Palace after another, all of them exploding with a single slap. No Starlord could withstand the seemingly simple strike, nor did they have the chance to counterattack.

When the various factions saw how powerful Truth Listener was without the need to use any countermeasures or strategies to kill the Starlords, their expressions turned extremely odd.

They originally wanted to observe Human Sovereign’s strength through this battle, but now, they didn’t even know what abilities Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast had, much less Human Sovereign’s strength.

Such a slap was like striking an egg. Nothing could be seen.

…

“Young Master Wen’s Companion Beast should be the strongest in the world.” An Sheng sighed.

“Humph, to rely on external forces and not pay attention to his cultivation will result in him suffering sooner or later.” Although An Tianzuo said that, he couldn’t help but size up Truth Listener.

…

The first six Starlords failed to cause any trouble for Truth Listener. Now, people were wondering if the long staircase in front of Alkaid Star Palace that could drain Essence Energy could restrain Human Sovereign and his Companion Beast.

“The first six Star Palaces failed to put any pressure on Human Sovereign. Will the final Alkaid Star Palace give him some pressure?” Su Yi was confident in Human Sovereign. She firmly believed that Human Sovereign would definitely be able to clear the seventh Star Palace. She only wanted to know if the long staircase could cause any trouble for him.

“In theory, the long stairs can wipe out Essence Energy. Even if that Companion Beast’s strength is invincible, it’s still an Essence Energy creature after all. It will definitely be restrained on the long steps. If Human Sovereign doesn’t have a way to restrain the flight of stairs, I’m afraid this won’t be easy. However, since Human Sovereign came, he must be prepared. I believe he should have the ability to restrain the stairs. Then, all he needs to do is unsummon the Companion Beast and summon it after entering the Star Palace. That will resolve all the problems.” Professor Gu analyzed the strategy that Zhou Wen might use.
