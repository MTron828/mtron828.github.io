Chapter 854: Pursuit?

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen packed his things and prepared to leave Mount Dragon Tiger.

He had previously rejected Moses, and now that he had packed his things and fled, it was very likely that Moses would chase after him and intercept him. When that happened, it would be Zhou Wen’s homeground.

Even if the Giant God Sovereign really had the strength of the Ant City Guardian, Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of employing guerrilla tactics.

Earth Escape, teleportation, invisibility, and with his excellent movement techniques, it could be said that Zhou Wen was best at guerrilla warfare.

Zhou Wen packed his things and was about to leave with Ya’er when he saw Zhang Chunqiu rush over.

“Zhou Wen, are you planning on leaving Mount Dragon Tiger?” Zhang Chunqiu asked directly.

“That’s right,” Zhou Wen answered.

“It’s best you don’t leave now. We realized that Moses and Charlie have reached a tacit agreement. If you leave now, you definitely won’t be able to escape the pursuit of the two families. Charlie’s Book of Prophecy is best at finding people. You have already shown yourself in front of him. As long as you aren’t too far from him, he will be able to find you no matter where you hide,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“It’s fine. It’s perfect that way,” Zhou Wen said.

Zhang Chunqiu was slightly taken aback, unsure what Zhou Wen meant. He stared at Zhou Wen with an odd expression and said, “Don’t tell me you want to attack Moses and company as well?”

“Why not?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“At least make a trip to Celestial Master Manor. We have already prepared the resources needed to incubate the Earth Elemental Beast. It can help you incubate the Earth Elemental Beast in three days. When the time comes, you will be much safer,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“If that’s the case, will Moses still chase after me?” Zhou Wen paused and said, “Besides, I’ve already hatched the Earth Elemental Beast.”

With that said, Zhou Wen summoned the Earth Elemental Beast.

Zhang Chunqiu was dumbfounded. When he snapped to his senses, he said with a bitter smile, “It looks like Moses and the rest are destined to not be able to gain an advantage.”

“Who can they blame for their greed?” Zhou Wen put away the Earth Elemental Beast and bade Zhang Chunqiu farewell before secretly leaving Mount Dragon Tiger with Ya’er.

Looking at Zhou Wen’s departing back, Zhang Chunqiu muttered to himself, “This Zhou Wen is even more terrifying than An Tianzuo was. I’m afraid he will really turn the Federation upside down. In this era, I wonder if it’s a blessing or a curse.”

..

The news of Zhou Wen secretly leaving Mount Dragon Tiger naturally couldn’t be hidden from Moses and Charlie.

Charlie had already predicted Zhou Wen’s departure as he said with a sneer, “It hasn’t even been twenty-four hours since he obtained the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg. He definitely won’t be able to hatch it in time. As long as we catch up to him, we will have a chance of getting the Companion Egg back.”

“Then what are we waiting for? Before he returns to Luoyang, we have to stop him and snatch the Companion Egg from him,” said Moses.

“Not only do I want the Companion Egg, but I also want his life.” A cold glint flashed in Charlie’s eyes. The grudge between Zhou Wen and the Cape family naturally wouldn’t be resolved with Zhou Wen’s shattering of the Ghoul Mask on his face. He wouldn’t consider how Zhou Wen had saved his life.

With the two families mobilizing their forces together, the originally lively Dragon Tiger Town suddenly became much quieter.

“Celestial Master, Zhou Wen has already left Dragon Tiger Town. Moses and Charlie have also led their men to chase after him.” An intelligence officer from the Zhang family reported to Zhang Siyou.

“Should we send someone over and wait for an opportunity to snatch the Earth Elemental Beast back? If we can snatch it back this time, we can prevent others from knowing that the Earth Elemental Beast is in our Zhang family.” Uncle Zhang’s eyes lit up. Zhang Chunqiu hadn’t returned to report that Zhou Wen had already hatched the Earth Elemental Beast, so he wasn’t aware.

“There’s no need. Moses and company aren’t Zhou Wen’s match,” Zhang Siyou said indifferently.

“That might not be the case, right? After all, Moses has a Guardian. His strength can’t be underestimated. With Charlie’s Book of Prophecy, Zhou Wen probably won’t be able to escape that easily.” Uncle Zhang didn’t think so.

Zhang Siyou said, “So what if he has a Guardian? What kind of person is Old Master Xia? Even he wasn’t able to kill Zhou Wen, much less a mere Moses who relies on a Guardian. They will probably be doomed if they attack him.”

Although the eldest uncle of the Zhang family didn’t quite believe Zhang Siyou’s judgment, he couldn’t refute it. After all, Zhang Siyou’s knowledge and judgment far exceeded his. Otherwise, he would have taken over as Celestial Master instead of Zhang Siyou who was the second eldest in the family.

Zhou Wen ran all the way. He didn’t really want to escape, but to create the illusion that he was escaping.

Moses and company kept chasing after Zhou Wen. With Charlie’s Book of Prophecy tracking Zhou Wen’s location, they got closer and closer.

“That bastard Zhou Wen is actually running so fast. We have to speed up,” Charlie said through gritted teeth. They had chased for hundreds of kilometers, but they still hadn’t caught up to Zhou Wen.

“It’s just a trapped beast’s struggle. He can’t escape...” Just as Moses spoke, a person on his left suddenly touched a tree. The tree exploded and sent the person flying. Several people nearby were affected. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“What happened?” Moses quickly checked the man’s injuries and saw that he was nearly half-dead.

“It’s a Life Blast-type Essence Energy Skill. It must have been left behind by that bastard, Zhou Wen,” said Charlie as he observed the destroyed tree.

“Damn it, Bayh. Stay and take care of them. The rest of you, follow me. I want that bastard dead,” Moses said angrily.

Everyone chased, but this time, they were much more careful. They didn’t touch the trees or grass.

After chasing for a distance, they arrived at a grassland. Just as they approached, they alarmed a group of insects in the grassland. Large swaths of them flew up.

“No good! Be careful of those insects!” Charlie shouted, but it was already too late. Someone had already waved their hands at the insects, hoping to drive them to the side.

However, when their powers hit the insects, it immediately triggered a series of explosions.

Due to the low life force of the worms, a large number of them exploded together, leaving them in a sorry state. Some people who weren’t paying attention had their eyes injured from the explosion, while others were covered in blood.

In their panic, they stepped on the grass. The grass also exploded, immediately causing a series of explosions.

“That bastard!” Moses saw that many people were injured. Although their injuries were not very serious, they looked pathetic.

When they continued chasing after Zhou Wen, they realized that the forest had turned into a huge minefield. Anything they touched could turn into a mine. This made them suspicious. Not only were many people injured, but their progress was also much slower.

“If this continues, that bastard will escape. Someone with a flying pet, chase after him with me. The others will circle around and take the main road and see if they can intercept him.” After Moses and Charlie discussed the plan, the two of them continued chasing with flying pets.
