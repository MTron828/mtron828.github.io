Chapter 1846: Setting the Ground Rules

Translator: CKtalon

“Let’s leave the dimensional space now.” Zhou Wen got Ah Yong to lead the way.

It wasn’t easy to leave. Without Ah Yong leading the way, it was impossible to find a way out.

They had to take a specific path to see the Lake of the Sky. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

After leaving the dimensional space, Zhou Wen looked at Ah Yong and said, “You have to be mentally prepared. Although you have half a human bloodline, you might still be restricted on Earth.”

“I understand.” Ah Yong nodded.

“Also, before we go, we have to set some ground rules,” Zhou Wen continued.

“What do you mean by ground rules?” Ah Yong didn’t understand human speak.

“It means that there will be rules between us. You have to abide by them when we reach Earth. Otherwise, I won’t take you to Earth,” Zhou Wen explained.

“It’s just a contract then. What kind of contract do you want?” Ah Yong understood.

“Firstly, after arriving on Earth, you have to listen to me. You can’t do anything I don’t allow you to do,” Zhou Wen said.

“Am I not to see that person if you don’t permit me?” Ah Yong widened her eyes.

“Yes, you definitely can’t do anything I disallow you from doing. Of course, this is only to prevent you from doing anything that will harm humans. As long as you don’t do anything overboard, this agreement won’t affect you too much,” Zhou Wen explained.

“I’m just going to see that person. I’m not going to kill anyone. I won’t do anything to harm humans. You can rest assured about that.” Ah Yong agreed to Zhou Wen’s conditions.

“Second, you can’t act alone after arriving on Earth. No matter where you go, you have to inform me first. You can only go after I agree,” Zhou Wen said.

“Why must I get your permission?” Ah Yong was very displeased.

“Sigh, you can only blame yourself for being too strong. The power in you is too terrifying. Humans and even Earth are too weak compared to you. Even an unintentional action of yours might injure many people. I can’t do anything about it. It’s your fault for being so strong,” Zhou Wen said as he shrugged.

Ah Yong beamed when she heard that. “Being strong is also a vexing problem. Alright then, I’ll give you weak Earthlings a break. I agree to this contract.”

“Third... I’ll tell you in the future.” Zhou Wen coughed lightly. In fact, he hadn’t thought of the third rule.

“Why wait until later?” Ah Yong asked in puzzlement.

“Your talent is amazing and your growth speed is so fast. If your strength greatly increases every few days, how would I know what new problems will appear? When there are new problems, I can only resolve them when the time comes...”

“That’s true. Alright then, I’ll be understanding of you guys.” Ah Yong couldn’t help but smile.

“Then let’s make a contract. You are so strong that no one on Earth can restrain you. We can only rely on a contract.” Zhou Wen wore a helpless expression.

Ah Yong happily signed a contract with Zhou Wen, unaware that she had already sold herself.

After signing the contract, Zhou Wen used Mystic Thearch’s Sovereign of the Universe and tore through space to return to Earth with Ah Yong.

The reason he didn’t use it when he came was that he didn’t know where he was going in the dimension. There was plenty of randomness when he used Sovereign of the Universe.

If he were to teleport directly into a dimensional race’s nest, who knew if he could escape?

“Is this a human city? It doesn’t look like much. It’s dirty, dilapidated, and old. It doesn’t look good at all.” Ah Yong looked around curiously.

Zhou Wen looked at the city in front of him and said casually, “How can Earth compare to the dimension? I don’t understand either. Why do the bigwigs of the dimension insist on coming to Earth?”

He didn’t dare take Ah Yong back to Guide Ancient City, nor did he dare let her go to Luoyang to meet An Sheng immediately.

This was the Cape family’s territory. He brought Ah Yong here first to confirm that she would abide by the contract before deciding how to settle her down.

When the soldiers guarding the city saw Zhou Wen, their expressions immediately changed. They hurriedly took out their phones and contacted the Cape family’s upper echelons.

Before Zhou Wen reached the door with Ah Yong, he saw the head of the Cape family, Shann Cape, welcome him with a few of the Cape family’s upper echelons.

“Welcome, Your Excellency Human Sovereign. I’ve already ordered my servants to prepare a banquet...” Shann Cape welcomed him with a smile, not mentioning the grudge between the Cape family and Zhou Wen.

Shann Cape had put in a lot of effort. He was very good at entertaining the guests and did so with great flair.

If Zhou Wen didn’t know what the Cape family was like in the past, he would have imagined that this family was a benevolent family.

The dimension respected strength and evolution was its life goal. It didn’t have the mood or time to pull such tricks.

Ah Yong had never seen so many novel things. Just all the kinds of food made her almost forget her goal for coming to Earth. Her mouth didn’t stop eating the moment she arrived at the Cape family’s residence.

Ah Yong had fun with all sorts of entertainment. The entire trip was very pleasant.

An Sheng, An Sheng, if this is really your daughter, as your brother, I’ve helped you take care of your child. Zhou Wen used the Cape family’s place to entertain Ah Yong. When he left, Ah Yong even left with many gifts.

She didn’t stand on ceremony with any of the tailor-made dresses or jewelry. She took whatever looked good.

The necklace around Shann Cape’s neck was given to her just because Ah Yong said that it looked good.

In fact, Shann Cape didn’t know Ah Yong’s identity. Zhou Wen had already used a method to conceal Ah Yong’s aura, so ordinary people couldn’t tell her identity.

Shann Cape was naturally so cooperative because of Zhou Wen.

“He’s finally gone.” The Cape family watched Zhou Wen and Ah Yong leave and heaved a sigh of relief.

Ever since Zhou Wen’s identity as Human Sovereign was exposed, the Cape family had been living in fear, afraid that Zhou Wen would cause trouble for them.

The last time Zhou Wen went to the Heaven dimensional zone, it had made the Cape family nervous for a while, believing that it was a signal that Zhou Wen was about to attack the Cape family.

Zhou Wen was an existence that could fight Apocalypse-grade creatures. He was undoubtedly the strongest human. The Cape family knew that once Zhou Wen wanted the Cape family destroyed, they had no chance of survival.

Although the Cape family had already made preparations to have many descendants change their names and be sent elsewhere, that was only enough to preserve their bloodline.

While Ah Yong was playing, Zhou Wen had used his phone to contact An Sheng.

“Ah Sheng, how are you going to thank me?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Young Master Wen, what are you talking about? Why should I thank you?” An Sheng was taken aback by Zhou Wen’s words, unsure what he meant.

“Shouldn’t you thank me for helping you take care of your daughter?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Young Master Wen, you were never one for jokes,” An Sheng said helplessly, believing that Zhou Wen was joking. Furthermore, it was a very lame joke.

“I’m not joking. Your daughter is really here. She’s beside me,” Zhou Wen stopped teasing An Sheng and said seriously.

“What do you mean?” An Sheng also felt that something was amiss. Zhou Wen didn’t seem to be joking with him.

Zhou Wen recounted Ah Yong’s origins. An Sheng fell silent for a long time.

“Young Master Wen, where are you now? Can I meet her?” An Sheng’s voice sounded again with a heavy tone.

This time, it was Zhou Wen’s turn to be alarmed. “Ah Sheng, is she really your daughter?”

“I don’t know. I don’t have any memories of the past. The memories before Overseer took me back to the An family are all gone. All these years, I’ve been hoping to regain my memories, but I have no clue. Therefore, I want to see Ah Yong,” An Sheng said.

“Name a place. I’ll take her there now.” Zhou Wen could understand An Sheng’s feelings. Without knowing his own identity, An Sheng probably hadn’t had a good time all these years.
