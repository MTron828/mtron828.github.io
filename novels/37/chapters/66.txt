Chapter 67 Sudden Shackles

However, the circulatory path wasn’t that of the Lost Immortal Sutra, but a brand new one. It seemed as though he had completely switched Primordial Energy Arts.

Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra? Zhou Wen immediately recalled that the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra he memorized followed such circulatory methods.

With the Primordial Energy’s circulation, Zhou Wen felt the cells in his body seem to come to life. His body burned and itched as though countless worms were crawling under his skin.

He resisted the urge to scratch himself, but in fact, he didn’t dare move. When the energy flowed into him according to the Lost Immortal Sutra, he could move freely, but the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra was different. The turbulent flowing of Primordial Energy made Zhou Wen afraid of moving, afraid that it would branch out wrongly.

After sitting on the sofa for quite some time, Zhou Wen felt his body jolt as though some shackle had been cleaved apart. His body relaxed indescribably as the hot and itchy feeling vanished.

Zhou Wen could sense that he had achieved initial mastery of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.

Opening his eyes and planning to look at his phone, Zhou Wen got a fright when he looked at his hands.

They were covered in lumps of peeled skin. He ripped off the skin without feeling any pain. In fact, it felt awesome.

Soon, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn’t just his hands. His entire body had shed a layer of skin. Large amounts of dead skin could be easily peeled off by him.

He had no choice but to head for the bathroom and soak himself in hot water. The dead skin on his body peeled off, revealing supple new skin that had a milky luster to it.

He looked at himself in the mirror after taking a bath. There weren’t any intrinsic differences other than he now looked more refreshed and cleaner.

Returning to the living room, he once again lost himself to gaming. After he saw the stats of the blood-colored avatar, he couldn’t help but be alarmed.

After cultivating the Lost Immortal Sutra, his four stats were at 10. It didn’t improve even if he absorbed dimensional crystals.

But now, his Constitution had raised to 11.

Zhou Wen subconsciously looked at the other stats which hadn’t changed. Even the listing of Primordial Energy Art remained as Lost Immortal Sutra. It didn’t have the addition of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.

What happened? Why didn’t the game indicate my mastering of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra? Could it be that the game is unable to identify this kind of Primordial Energy Art? Zhou Wen felt puzzled as he attempted to circulate it and found it circulating as he wished. Clearly, he had gained some initial mastery of it.

He attempted to circulate the Lost Immortal Sutra and his Primordial Energy immediately circulated according to its pathway just as it had before without any changes.

Odd, what’s happening? Zhou Wen made a few more attempts and realized that he could freely switch between the Lost Immortal Sutra and Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra without any difficulty.

Zhou Wen seldom heard of people cultivating two Primordial Energy Arts at the same time. Many Primordial Energy Skills could be learned, but Primordial Energy Arts involved too many things. Typically, the higher the grade of the arts, the more conflict they had, making it difficult to cultivate two at the same time. It was especially so with arts capable of the Epic stage. If one were to cultivate both, it was possible to suffer a deviation and end up dying

To be able to switch freely between two Primordial Energy Arts was something Zhou Wen had never seen before.

He was just about to attempt using the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra to enter the temple when he heard his phone ring.

“Zhou Wen, it’s about time. Let’s meet at the lotus pond,” Hui Haifeng’s voice sounded over the phone.

“Got it.” Zhou Wen looked at the time and realized that it was almost nine. Although he hadn’t taken a wink of sleep the entire night, he was in no way tired.

He rushed to Underground Buddha City after packing up.

“Zhou Wen, you sure made us wait,” Gao Yang said in displeasure.

“I don’t think I was late, right?” Zhou Wen looked at the time. It was ten minutes to the agreed-upon time.

“Let’s not talk about that. Here’s the information on our Companion Beasts. Have a look.” Hui Haifeng handed Zhou Wen a tablet computer.

The information included the details of the four people’s four Companion Beast, including Hui Haifeng. There were even videos of the skills their Companion Beasts could release. It made it easy for Zhou Wen to understand what abilities they had.

After carefully taking in the information, Zhou Wen looked up and asked Hui Haifeng, “You plan to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with the four Legendary Companion Beasts without joining the battle, right?”

“We only have one life after all. It’s best if we don’t take risks.” Hui Haifeng looked at Zhou Wen and said, “If four Companion Beasts aren’t enough, I can still think of other solutions.”

“As long as your control isn’t too poor, these four Companion Beasts should be enough. However, I have to make it clear. All of you have to obey my instructions. If any problems arise due to the disobedience of my instructions, I will not be responsible for anything. I will not refund the Companion Egg either,” Zhou Wen said.

“No problem. We’ll leave it all up to you.” Hui Haifeng was rather obliging.

“Alright then. Let me go through the detailed plan. However, a plan is ultimately a plan. When the actual battle happens, follow my orders.” Zhou Wen informed them of his plan.

Hui Haifeng and company didn’t raise any objections after hearing it. One of the girls named Nana looked at Zhou Wen with piqued interest and asked, “If we follow your instructions in battle, but end up failing to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus or have any losses, what will you do?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“I’ll make compensation,” Zhou Wen said casually.

“Alright.” Nana was very pleased with his reply.

Zhou Wen pointed at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus and said, “If there are no other problems, let’s begin now,”

Hui Haifeng and company summoned their Legendary Companion Beasts—three of them were birds while Nana’s was a vine. According to the detailed information, this was a Water Wisteria at the Legendary stage. It could resist the lotus pond’s corrosive nature and could move in the water. It was a plant-based Companion Beast that was excellent at water combat.

Under Zhou Wen’s command, the four Companion Beasts charged into the lotus pond.

Many students were watching this battle. Although the battle involving Zhou Wen and Li Xuan was interesting, they had failed to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. This time, with Hui Haifeng participating, many students believed that there was a high possibility of slaying it.

Not far away, two of the university’s teachers were looking at the lotus pond.

“Miss Wang, do you think Hui Haifeng and the rest will succeed?” Liu Zhengyan looked at the four Companion Beasts rushing into the lotus pond and asked in passing.

“Zhou Wen and Li Xuan nearly succeeded the last time. This time, Li Xuan has been swapped with the stronger Hui Haifeng. The chance of victory is naturally higher,” Wang Fei said.
