Chapter 1102: Ganking

Translator: CKtalon

Celestial Gods... Di Tian’s palace...

An enchanting woman looked at the battle in the cube as her beautiful face revealed a look of surprise. “What’s that wooden club? It can actually withstand Blood Shaman’s Blood Thinning powers?”

Di Tian said indifferently, “It’s a Terror item of the extreme Yin attribute. Furthermore, it has reached the level of a physical weapon. How can such a level of Blood Thinning power injure it? If that thing was in the hands of its true owner, Blood Shaman would already be dead.”

“In that case, it’s impossible for Blood Shaman to win. Then, we can only hope that the kings of the various races can reach an agreement and kick that person out,” the woman said.

“There’s no need for that. Although Blood Shaman no longer has a chance, it has given us an important piece of information,” Di Tian said slowly.

“What important information?” The woman was somewhat puzzled.

“Although I don’t know what Guardian that person has fused with, I can now confirm that he hasn’t reached the Terror grade. All he can rely on is that Terror-grade Companion Beast and the corporeal Terror weapon in his hand. As long as one can resolve these two things, he won’t be able to withstand a single blow from the Terror grade,” Di Tian said casually.

“I’m afraid it won’t be easy, right? His Companion Beast in her Terror form is too powerful. Typical Terror-grade creatures aren’t her match at all. Which Guardian would be her match if that Companion Beast could be summoned? However, Blood Shaman is afraid of that wooden club. There’s no chance of winning,” the woman said.

“Since there’s no chance for a single Blood Shaman, add a few more to the lineup.” Di Tian slowly stood up.

“Your Excellency, it doesn’t seem appropriate to change the rules of the cube without the approval of the various races, right?” The woman immediately understood what Di Tian was trying to do.

“There’s no need to change the rules. As the host of this cube battle, I still have this tiny bit of authority.” As Di Tian spoke, he took a step forward and passed through space, heading towards the cube.

As everyone watched in excitement, Zhou Wen constantly attacked while Blood Shaman retreated in defeat. However, when they suddenly saw a distorted light descend from the void, their hearts skipped a beat.

Indeed, the distorted shadow that had appeared a few times previously appeared above the cube’s arena again.

“What does he want again?”

“Could it be that he wants to change the rules because they can’t beat us again?”

“What else do they know other than changing the rules?”

“Why don’t you just kick Human out? You’ve already done it once anyway.”

“People can’t be so shameless.”

“People naturally can’t be so shameless. Unfortunately, they aren’t humans.”

“They are beasts.”

The spectators were angry and frustrated as they mocked loudly. Unfortunately, it was useless. Their voices couldn’t reach the cube, so Di Tian couldn’t hear them. Even if he could hear them, he wouldn’t care. He would only smack them to death with a swat.

Di Tian looked down at the arena and spoke like a god who ruled over everything. “In order to quickly determine first place, the top ten creatures on the rankings can immediately enter the arena to fight. The loser will be immediately eliminated. The rules from before remain unchanged. Every creature only has one chance to issue a challenge.”

After speaking, Di Tian tore through the air and returned to the palace of the Celestial Gods.

After everyone heard that, they subconsciously looked at the rankings and immediately cursed.

“F*ck you. Apart from Human in the top ten, the rest are Guardians. Isn’t letting them in merely to have them gank Human?”

“Shameless.” The Zhang family’s hot-tempered eldest uncle cursed out loud.

“Do they have any shame?”

Everyone was extremely furious. They wished they could spit at them and drown the creatures of the dimension.

However, despite cursing, several Guardians in the top ten had already entered the arena. In just a moment, eight Guardians in the top ten had arrived.

There was only one Guardian in the top ten who didn’t participate.

On an island overseas, a cultured young man was about to board the cube when he suddenly retreated.

A figure appeared where the young man had stood as though he had teleported. It was none other than the Terror-grade Guardian, Cave Era. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You’d better stay behind and not go anywhere,” said Cave Era as she looked at the young man.

“Why?” The young man wasn’t angry as he asked with a smile.

“Because you can’t go on stage,” said Cave Era.

“I’m also in the top ten. Why can’t I go on stage?” the young man asked again.

“Do you want to kill that Human after you go on stage, or do you want to help him?” Cave Era asked.

“Help him,” the young man answered.

“That’s why you can’t go on stage.”

“What if I have to go?” The smile on the young man’s face vanished as he became serious.

“Defeat me and you can go,” Cave Era said.

The young man suddenly laughed. “Sis, stop joking. Your Guardian is already at the Terror grade, but my Guardian hasn’t advanced to the Terror grade. How can I defeat you?”

“Then stay here obediently and be a spectator,” said Cave Era.

“Alright.” The young man walked towards Cave Era, but his eyes were on the cube’s screen. “Sis, do you think that person has a chance of defeating the ganking of those Guardians?”

“There’s no chance...” Before Cave Era could say anything, the young man suddenly attacked. He pressed a hand on Cave Era’s shoulder and a flower vine wrapped around her body, instantly wrapping her up like a mummy.

Taking advantage of this moment, the young man rushed towards the cube, wanting to enter the cube’s arena.

However, just as he rushed to the cube, he saw Cave Era standing on it.

“You can go if you want, but defeat me first,” Cave Era said coldly as she looked at the young man.

“Sis, must we do this?” The young man sighed.

“Defeat me or watch the battle here,” said Cave Era expressionlessly.

The young man stared at Cave Era. The gentleness on his face had vanished. He softly spat out two words. “Fairy... Burial...”

Petals surged out of his body and gradually condensed into a floral armor that enveloped his slender body.

In the arena, the eight Guardians had already surrounded Zhou Wen from different directions. There were Guardians blocking his path in every single direction.

Their goal was very clear. Just as people had guessed, they had no intention of engaging in a free-for-all battle. Their only target was Human.

Furthermore, they had already obtained the news from the dimension. They knew that Human wasn’t at the Terror grade at all. He was only at the Mythical stage. They had already guessed this from Zhou Wen’s battle with Blood Shaman.
