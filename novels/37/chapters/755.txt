Chapter 756: Three-Sided Struggle

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen immediately realized what the problem was. Previously, Xia Jiuhuang had a Guardian who had fused with him, taking his body to the Mythical stage. However, Zhou Wen had just killed the Guardian. Without a Guardian, Xia Jiuhuang—who hadn’t advanced to the Mythical stage—was only at the Epic stage, and he had nearly been killed by Zhou Wen’s saber strike. He was in a weakened state, so the Primordial Spore was able to succeed in such a short period of time.

Once the parasitism succeeded, it could quickly sprout before Xia Jiuhuang really advanced to the Mythical stage, unlike when it parasitized Mythical creatures.

From the information transmitted by the Primordial Spore, it wouldn’t take long to completely control Xia Jiuhang.

Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. He originally believed that there was only one way to fight to the death, but he never expected that after reaching a dead end, a tiny Primordial Spore would turn the situation around.

Boom!

At the most critical moment of Xia Jiuhuang’s evolution, bolts of lightning struck down from the dark clouds and struck him continuously like a waterfall of lightning.

Not only did the lightning not injure Xia Jiuhuang, but he also used the power of lightning to help him evolve, allowing his body to become closer and closer to a Mythical physique.

According to what Zhou Wen knew, all Mythical creatures’ original stats were 11. As for humans, their original stats were estimated to be 1. It was even possible that they didn’t reach 1. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After all, human infants were too weak. They were far inferior to ordinary Legendary creatures, much less Mythical creatures.

Even ordinary Legendary creatures and Epic creatures seldom advanced to the Mythical stage; therefore, it was almost impossible for humans to advance to the Mythical stage.

Xia Jiuhuang had condensed nine supreme-grade Life Providences and Life Souls. He also needed a large amount of energy to advance to the Mythical stage. The ten thousand Epic humans from before were prepared by Xia Jiuhuang for this very purpose.

However, from the looks of it, it was still insufficient. With the help of the heavenly lightning, he was able to take the final step as his body rapidly transformed.

Unlike the combination of a Guardian, Xia Jiuhuang’s entire body emitted a mythical power. Every cell and strand of hair contained terrifying energy.

The present Xia Jiuhuang didn’t show any signs of an old man. His body was filled with the vitality of youth and terrifying explosive power. It was as though he could shatter mountains and rivers with a casual flick of his finger.

Xia Jiuhuang, who had long black hair dancing in the wind, was bathed in lightning. He looked like a resurrected ancient demon god.

On his forehead, the ‘Emperor’ word grew brighter and brighter like a purple star.

Boom!

With the final bolt of lightning striking him, Xia Jiuhuang completed the transformation from a human to a Mythical. It wasn’t a Mythical advancement with the help of a Guardian, but a true advancement with a human body. This was likely the first in human history.

“Finally... I’ve finally advanced to the Mythical stage...” Xia Jiuhuang floated in midair and raised his palm. He admired his transformed body as his excited voice trembled.

He had racked his brains and even faked his death to secretly scheme for so many years. Now, he had taken the final step.

Zhou Wen didn’t move because he could sense that the Primordial Spore was about to complete its soul parasitization. As long as the soul parasitization succeeded, it would be useless no matter how strong Xia Jiuhuang was.

“Zhou Wen, you should feel honored to be the first person to die under the power of a human Mythical.” Xia Jiuhuang wanted to use Zhou Wen to test how powerful his Mythical powers were. The ‘Emperor’ character on his forehead lit up as he prepared to attack Zhou Wen.

However, Xia Jiuhuang suddenly screamed. He hugged his head and yelled. His voice was extremely shrill, as though someone had drilled into his brain with an electric drill.

Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he saw the purple ‘Emperor’ character. He immediately understood what had happened.

That crappy piece of wood isn’t helping Xia Jiuhuang at all. Instead, it wants to enslave or even occupy Xia Jiuhuang’s Mythical body. Zhou Wen recalled the slave word on his forehead and connected it to the ‘Emperor’ character on Xia Jiuhuang’s forehead. Although the words were different, the form was surprisingly similar.

Looking at the screaming Xia Jiuhuang, Zhou Wen also received a message from the Primordial Spore. It was as though a force was vying for control of Xia Jiuhuang’s soul from Primordial Spore.

Xia Jiuhuang kept screaming. Now, his body could be considered a power struggle between powers—Xia Jiuhuang, Primordial Spore, and the “Emperor” on his forehead.

The three parties wanted to control Xia Jiuhuang’s body, but his will was the weakest. Even the Primordial Spore failed to gain an absolute advantage. The strongest was the ‘Emperor’ word.

“Why... Why is this happening... Jing Daoxian clearly said that as long as I can advance to the Mythical stage with a nine-life body... I will have the destiny of a Great Emperor... Why is this happening...” Xia Jiuhuang roared with a tragic cry. He wanted to slam his head into the ground, but his body didn’t listen to him. It left him alarmed and furious.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback when he heard Xia Jiuhuang’s roar. Jing Daoxian is actually involved in this matter?

Zhou Wen felt that he had seen this scene somewhere before. After some thought, he recalled that Lord Alcohol had said something similar after eating the Longevity Fruit.

Looking at Xia Jiuhuang who was in excruciating pain, Zhou Wen suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. He had a bad feeling.

Lord Alcohol and Xia Jiuhuang were people who wanted to break through to the Mythical stage. Furthermore, they had listened to Jing Daoxian’s words to reach this stage.

As for the Lost Immortal Sutra that Zhou Wen cultivated, it was also from Jing Daoxian. Now that Zhou Wen wanted to advance to the Mythical stage, he felt that he was somewhat similar to Xia Jiuhang and company.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to think too much about it. The Primordial Spore wasn’t able to gain the upper hand. Its control over Xia Jiuhuang’s body was weakening, and Xia Jiuhuang’s will was about to vanish. Only the ‘Emperor’ word’s glow was getting stronger. It was only a matter of time before he gained control of Xia Jiuhuang’s body.

Before Xia Jiuhuang’s body was completely controlled, Zhou Wen drew his saber and slashed forward. At the same time, Truth Listener and Demonic Neonate attacked under Zhou Wen’s orders.

With the Primordial Spore restraining him, Xia Jiuhuang couldn’t move at all. Demonic Neonate didn’t need to find another opportunity as she unsheathed her demonic sword and stabbed forward.

Zhou Wen’s injuries were too serious, preventing him from using Sigh of the King. His strength was extremely limited, so when he slashed at Xia Jiuhuang’s body, not only did he fail to injure him, but he was sent flying by Xia Jiuhuang’s strength.

Zhou Wen fell to the ground as his wounds tore open. He grimaced in pain.

Thankfully, Truth Listener was more powerful. It shattered two earrings and brutally stabbed its claws into Xia Jiuhuang’s chest. The demonic sword stabbed into Xia Jiuhuang’s head, inch by inch.

The ‘Emperor’ word shimmered as it attempted to blast the demonic sword out, but Truth Listener violently struck Xia Jiuhuang’s forehead, causing the ‘Emperor’ word to tremble violently.
