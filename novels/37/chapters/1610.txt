Chapter 1611: I’m Thief Sage

Translator: CKtalon

“The sun is the source of life. All life is born from the power of the sun. No matter how strong you are, it’s impossible for you to be an enemy of the sun. This is because your strength originates from the sun.” Jiuyang struck out again and again, suppressing Zhong Ziya, preventing him from slashing out

with his sword.

“So what if I’m born because of the sun? If parents give birth to children, do children have to be inferior to their parents? Tempered steel is born from iron ores, but when forged into sabers and swords, it can slice through iron like mud… Ignoring the fact that the sun might not be the source of all life,

even if it is… Iwill defy the heavens and slay the source…” Zhong Ziya’s eyes were like a sword as the sword intent on his body constantly erupted. The sword beam from Primordial Immortal Sword in his hand became stronger and stronger.

“Not a bad idea and you are brave. Unfortunately, it’s still lacking the necessary oomph.” Jiuyang’s palms were like the palms of Buddha of the Great Sun. No matter how powerful Zhong Ziya’s sword moves were, they were suppressed.

Pfft!

‘The sword beam was suppressed by the sun-like palm force as it shattered like glass. The sword in Zhong Ziya’s hand was pressed down inch by inch as blood spewed out of his mouth.

Bang!

Jiuyang’s palm crushed Zhong Ziya’s entire body.

Everyone was alarmed, but in the blink of an eye, Zhong Ziya’s figure appeared elsewhere with the Primordial Immortal Sword in his arms. He was uninjured, as though everything that had happened was an illusion.

“What kind of oomph do you want? Sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, or salty?” As Zhong Ziya spoke, he moved, leaving behind afterimages.

No, instead of calling them afterimages, they were actually identical to Zhong Ziya’s original body. It was impossible to tell which was the real Zhong Ziya.

The five replicas of Zhong Ziya drew their swords and charged at Jiuyang. The sword beams crisscrossed, each more ferocious than the last.

Jiuyang opened his palms and blocked the attacks of all five Zhong Ziyas.

The five Zhong Ziyas were clearly not as simple as illusions. Their powers were real, identical to Zhong Ziya’s true body. It was impossible to tell which was Zhong Ziya’s true body.

“An ugly piece of work has zero value no matter how many times you replicate it.” Jiuyang only had two hands that used moves so simple that anyone could understand; yet, he still suppressed Zhong Ziya and shattered his avatars one after another.

“Replicas indeed have no value, but the paintings used for practice are different. Perhaps in your eyes, every painting is ugly, but no matter how great a painting is, it’s built on this ugliness…” Zhong Ziya’s figure blinked as his avatars appeared like ghosts and charged at Jiuyang from different corners.

“That depends on who the artist is. Not everyone has the potential of a master. Do you?” Jiuyang said indifferently.

“I don’t. I only know how to kill,” the Zhong Ziyas that filled the sky like ghosts answered in unison. Sword beams overlapped and crisscrossed like a net as they enveloped Jiuyang from all directions.

“That’s why you’re still lacking the oomph.” Jiuyang stood like a Buddha as he raised his palm. Like the rising sun, he melted the sword beams.

Meanwhile, Immortal and Old K’s battle continued.

The scepter in Old K’s hand released the power of Imperial Authority again and again, hoping to restrain Immortal’s body. However, Immortal’s movement technique was ethereal. The power of Imperial authority was ultimately unable to restrain his body.

Jiang Yan didn’t seem to have any intention of killing Old K either. All he did was casually circle around Old K. Old K felt that Jiang Yan would grab his weakness and deliver a fatal strike if he didn’t attack. But if he did, he wouldn’t be able to do anything to Jiang Yan. With Jiang Yan holding him back, he

couldn’t help the rest. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Liu Yun was most tragic. He clearly hadn’t reached the same level as Xiao. They also had spatial powers, so he was almost at Xiao’s mercy.

It was only with the deterrence of the Taiji Symbol that he could barely last until now.

His clothes were almost drenched in blood, but for some reason, he didn’t use any armor-type Companion Beasts, nor did he summon a Guardian.

“F*ck, Eldest Senior Brother Thief Sage is too miserable!”

“Eldest Senior Brother, run!”

The people watching the livestream couldn’t see the details of the battle, but they would see a pause when Liu Yun phased into existence. Xiao’s figure would slide past Liu Yun like a ghost, leaving a new wound on him.

“Your spatial powers are too inferior. If that’s considered spatial powers, then your spatial powers are at most a child’s toy model of a world,” Xiao said disdainfully as he left another wound on Liu Yun’s body.

Liu Yun waved the Taiji Symbol in his hand and shone it in the direction of Xiao’s voice, but there was no sign of Xiao.

“Xiao, ignore that fellow. Stop Zhou Wen first. We can’t let him chip away at the teleportation nexus further,” Old K shouted.

“Alright.” Xiao agreed and took a step forward before disappearing. He dodged the power of the Taiji Symbol and headed for the teleportation nexus.

However, Liu Yun’s figure instant transmitted in front of Xiao and threw the Taiji Symbol at him.

The Taiji Symbol emitted a strange power in the air, sweeping everything around it into its interior as though it wanted to devour space.

Xiao’s figure flashed as he dodged the Taiji Symbol’s sweep. However, as the instant Xiao dodged, Liu Yun instant transmitted in front of him and smashed his hand at Xiao’s face.

Bang!

Xiao and Liu Yun had fought before. Liu Yun’s fist missed and slid past Xiao’s cheek. As for Xiao’s palm, it penetrated Liu Yun’s chest, right through his heart.

“You shouldn’t be my enemy.” Xiao flicked the blood from his palm and turned to head for the teleportation nexus.

“Eldest Senior Brother!” Upon seeing this scene, the people in front of the livestream couldn’t help but cry out.

Some sentimental women covered their mouths with their hands as tears welled in their eyes.

However, in the next second, the gown and shirt around Liu Yun’s body shattered and turned to ashes, revealing Liu Yun’s naked body. However, there were no injuries on his upper body.

Clearly, the tuxedo was some special Companion Beast which had suffered the injuries on Liu Yun’s behalf.

“I’s not a big deal to be your enemy.” Liu Yun extended his left hand. In between his fingers was a ring made of thin silk.

Xiao’s strength quickly dissipated and he dropped to the Hell level as though he had lost some kind of augmentation.

“You’re good.” Xiao’s pupils constricted slightly as he turned around and looked at the ring in Liu Yun’s hand.

“Although I’m not your match, don’t forget that my nickname is Thief Sage.” Liu Yun held the ring in one hand and the Taiji Symbol in the other. He said smugly, “Without the Holy Artifact, you’re only at the Hell level.. What right do you have to show off your superiority in front of me?”
