Chapter 1716 Caught Between a Rock and a Hard Place

Two of the five places with a concealed halo were the cave he was in and the pool that Liu Yun had taken Zhou Wen to.

Zhou Wen chose to open the cave in-game. Just as he was about to enter the cave, Liu Yun had already released his Companion Beast that sneaked towards the grass fruit.

It was a Companion Beast that looked like a rat, but it was slightly bigger than a cat. After it was summoned, its body jolted before it vanished in front of Zhou Wen. It was unknown what kind of invisibility it had used, but even his hearing couldn’t sense its existence.

Liu Yun actually has such a Companion Beast? Zhou Wen was alarmed. Just as he was about to use other methods to see if he could track it, the Companion Beast had already crawled out of the stone chamber and headed for the grass fruit.

Although Zhou Wen couldn’t see it, he could vaguely sense the location of the Companion Beast. After switching a few Essence Energy Arts and using Great Brahma’s powers, he saw its true body. Its invisibility ability couldn’t hide from Great Brahma’s Buddha Eyes.

The Companion Beast was also proficient in Earth Escape. After entering the garden, it vanished the moment it landed. When it appeared again, it was already beside a grass fruit. It extended its claws and was about to pluck the grass fruit when it suddenly saw a white light flash.

Before Liu Yun could unsummon the Companion Beast, he saw it vanish. The pheasant’s figure appeared as it raised its neck as though it had swallowed something.

“My Shadow Rat!” Liu Yun’s expression changed drastically. The other Companion Beasts he had prepared didn’t have the time to draw away the pheasant’s attention.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare continue gaming as he observed the pheasant’s reaction. Once the pheasant did anything out of order, he would immediately escape.

Thankfully, the pheasant didn’t seem to notice the stone chamber. After swallowing Liu Yun’s Shadow Rat, it immediately chased after the grass fruit baby.

“Eldest Senior Brother, my condolences,” Zhou Wen consoled.

“F*ck off. That’s a unique Shadow Rat. It wasn’t easy for me to feed it to the Calamity grade. Do you know how much effort I spent on it…” Liu Yun cursed gloomily.

“This is life. It’s best if we leave quickly.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to waste time here. Since he had already downloaded the game, there was no point in staying here.

Although Liu Yun was still somewhat indignant, he knew that things couldn’t be undone. Just as he was about to leave with Zhou Wen, he suddenly saw a flash of light. The grass fruit baby had burrowed into the stone chamber and was standing between Zhou Wen and Liu Yun. Its huge eyes that were extremely disproportionate to its face sized up Zhou Wen and Liu Yun.

Holy sh*t! Zhou Wen and Liu Yun felt their backs turn cold as they immediately had the thought of escaping.

However, this thought only existed in their mind and couldn’t be realized. Just as he looked at the hole from the corner of his eye, he saw a white figure standing there—it was the white pheasant.

“We’re doomed!” The two of them felt their hearts turn cold.

However, they weren’t the kind of people who would sit back and do nothing. They didn’t think at all and instinctively reacted.

Liu Yun instant transmitted to the garden outside the stone chamber.

The pheasant was standing at the hole at the exit. Instant transmission in that direction was almost equivalent to courting death. There might be a chance of survival if he rushed into the garden.

Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen made the same reaction. However, while he instant transmitted, he had already completed the fusion with Great Brahma. When he instant transmitted, he was already wearing dark-gold armor. The dark-gold wheel on his back emitted a dark black hole-like glow. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Bang!

The duo who had instant transmitted simultaneously seemed to slam into a stone wall and bounced back at the same time.

Liu Yun fell on his ass. Zhou Wen could barely stand, but he felt his head buzz from the collision. He felt like he had a concussion.

The pheasant and the grass baby remained rooted to the ground as they looked at the two of them from both sides.

“I told you to retrieve the sword earlier, but you insisted on wandering around. Look at what happened now? My life is gone because of you,” Liu Yun said with a sullen expression.

He knew that he couldn’t escape, so he didn’t even bother getting up. He just sat on the ground and looked at the two creatures.

Zhou Wen didn’t move again. The Teacher Domain had already been activated as he scanned the situation in the stone chamber, hoping to know what power had trapped them inside.

Strangely, there were no traces of the nomological powers of the pheasant and the grass fruit baby in the stone chamber. Clearly, the power that prevented them from instant transmitting out of the stone chamber didn’t come from the two strange creatures.

The power of the stone chamber is what’s stopping us from leaving? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

Zhou Wen and Liu Yun didn’t move, nor did the pheasant and the grass fruit baby take the initiative to attack. They only sized them up as though they were somewhat curious about them.

“I didn’t ask you to come in,” Zhou Wen said casually as he looked at the half-open door.

He couldn’t leave with spatial instant transmission, but it didn’t mean that he couldn’t leave. Perhaps this stone chamber only restricted spatial instant transmission. Perhaps there wouldn’t be any restrictions if one walked out of the door.

However, Zhou Wen knew very well that with his speed, it was impossible for him to be faster than the pheasant and the grass fruit baby. They hadn’t attacked yet, so if he rashly rushed out, he might immediately infuriate them.

“Anyway, nothing good will come from being with you. My life will be lost because of you sooner or later.” Liu Yun also realized the subtle situation. He just sat there and spoke without any intention of rushing out.

The pheasant’s silver eyes sized up the two of them, but after looking at them for a while, it seemed to lose interest in them and focused its gaze on the grass fruit baby.

From the looks of it, this fellow isn’t interested in eating meat. Zhou Wen was immediately delighted.

Indeed, the pheasant raised its claws and walked to the side as though it wanted to circle around Zhou Wen and Liu Yun to continue its hunt of the grass fruit baby.

Liu Yun was also overjoyed. At that moment, he didn’t dare say another word to prevent himself from provoking the pheasant.

As long as the pheasant charged at the grass fruit baby, the two of them would have a chance of burrowing out of the cave and leaving this terrifying place. Zhou Wen was calculating how far the pheasant needed to leave the cave before he could successfully rush out, but to his surprise, the pheasant only took two steps before the grass fruit baby moved.

The baby’s figure flashed and vanished from their sight.

“Junior Brother… You… On your head…” Liu Yun widened his eyes as he looked at Zhou Wen’s head as though he had seen a ghost.

If not for the Great Brahma armor covering Zhou Wen’s face, no one would have been able to see his face. They would definitely have realized that his expression was worse than Liu Yun’s.

This was because the grass fruit baby had jumped onto Zhou Wen’s head. It sat on the dark-gold helmet as its white feet levitated above Zhou Wen’s forehead, swaying back and forth.
