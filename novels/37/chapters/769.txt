Chapter 770: In front of the Earth Temple

Translator: CKtalon

In the next few days, Zhou Wen went to some dimensional zones in the Imperial Capital, but he didn’t gain anything. He didn’t discover the tiny palm symbols.

The Wang family had already settled the matter regarding the Xiao family. Although they had temporarily appeased the Xiao family, it was ultimately a hidden danger.

The Xiao family’s interest in Wang Chan probably wouldn’t stop because of Xiao Si’s death. The Wang family also wanted to figure out the cause of this matter. If possible, they even wanted to directly eliminate the Xiao family and eliminate this future trouble.

However, the Xiao family wasn’t weak. Furthermore, they were far away in the South District. The Wang family’s influence couldn’t reach that far yet.

Only the Dugu family, the ruler of the South District, could easily destroy a local wealthy family like the Xiao family.

The Wang family could only placate the Xiao family before slowly plotting in secret to figure out why they wanted Wang Chan.

The matters in the Imperial Capital had basically come to an end. Zhou Wen planned on returning to Luoyang. Before he left, Grandma Wang sent him off with Wang Lu and Wang Chan. She even urged him to visit her often in the future.

...

Zhou Wen left the Imperial Capital and arrived at an abandoned village. He saw An Sheng sitting on a tree root waiting for him.

“Young Master Wen, how’s Old Master Xia?” An Sheng had been here for so long. Although he hadn’t entered the Imperial Capital himself, he knew the situation inside the Imperial Capital like the back of his hand. He had already contacted Zhou Wen, but for the sake of safety, he didn’t ask for certain information.

“He won’t appear again in the future.” Zhou Wen recounted what had happened to Xia Jiuhuang, leaving An Sheng shocked.

“Old Master Xia is Xia Jiuhuang. Furthermore, his Invincible Connate Divine Art remains intact. In that case, the Xia family isn’t actually his bloodline?” An Sheng immediately had the same thought as Zhou Wen.

“Who knows? In theory, if the Invincible Connate Divine Art remains intact, it’s unlikely that Xia Jiuhuang has any descendants. However, his Invincible Connate Divine Art has already fused with the Great Emperor Sutra into the Connate Great Emperor Sutra. Perhaps he can have descendants. Now that he’s dead, I’m afraid no one will ever know this secret,” Zhou Wen said.

“How’s Forbidden City now?” An Sheng asked another important question.

“I don’t know either. You have to ask it.” Zhou Wen looked at the listless antelope.

An Sheng clearly knew that it was impossible for him to obtain an answer from the antelope, so he changed the topic. “Li Xuan went to the South District.”

“Why did he suddenly go to the South District?” Zhou Wen was taken aback. Li Xuan had not informed him about this.

“Did Li Mobai get him to go?” Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as his expression changed drastically.

“No, he went with Worm Dugu. Worm Dugu wanted to take him in as a disciple, but Li Xuan didn’t agree. In order to move Li Xuan, Worm Dugu told him some secrets, so Li Xuan wanted to try his luck in the South District. He was afraid that you would be anxious, so he didn’t let me tell you.” An Sheng recounted the entire matter.

Zhou Wen was really worried. Li Xuan might look carefree on the surface, but in fact, he was someone who was easily swayed by emotions. This was Li Xuan’s weakness and his strength. Zhou Wen was really afraid that something would happen to him in the South District.

There were many strange things in the South District. Gu worms, Kuman Thong, black magic, etc. Even if Li Xuan had an indestructible body, it wasn’t absolutely safe in such a place. Furthermore, Li Xuan hadn’t reached the indestructible realm. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It was too late to say anything now. Zhou Wen only hoped that Li Xuan would return safely.

“There’s a rather famous Earth temple ahead. Do you want to take a look?” An Sheng asked Zhou Wen when they arrived at a small town.

“Earth Temple? No harm visiting.” Zhou Wen still remembered that he had obtained a treasure map when he went to the Earth Temple. However, he didn’t manage to dig up any treasure. A baby-like dimensional creature had given him a metal walnut, and inside the metal walnut was Tai Sui.

All the Earth temples in the East District had similar functions. If a native were to pay respects to the Earth Lord, they might obtain a treasure map.

However, if one wasn’t native, Earth Lord would, unfortunately, ignore them even if they cracked their head kowtowing.

An Sheng took Zhou Wen to the nearby Earth temple. The Earth temple here was indeed much bigger than the one Zhou Wen had previously visited. Furthermore, the main god of this temple was land. It didn’t share temples and incense offerings with other gods.

“Treasure maps for sale. They are treasure maps obtained by authentic locals. Just one Legendary Companion Egg.”

“Newly produced treasure maps for only two Legendary Strength Crystals. They just need to be above a 6.”

“An ancestral treasure map...”

It was very lively in front of the Earth temple as though it was a market. Many stalls were selling treasure maps and some were selling crystals and Companion Eggs.

“Why aren’t these locals digging for treasures themselves?” Zhou Wen found it odd.

An Sheng said with a smile, “Do you really believe that these people are selling treasure maps? It’s been decades since the dimensional storms. The locals have long finished kowtowing. Only newborn infants have the right to pray to Earth Lord to get a treasure map. How many babies are born every year?”

Zhou Wen immediately understood that these people who sold treasure maps were similar to those who sold antiques and Buddha statues at a temple’s entrance. Most people knew that they were fake, but they still held onto the hope that they could be lucky.

“Unfortunately, we aren’t locals. It’s useless even if we kowtow. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be bad to get a treasure map to try our luck,” An Sheng said.

“That might not be the case. Although we aren’t locals, it’s very likely that Earth Lord will give us a treasure map if he appreciates our good character,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Lad, you sure are optimistic. Instead of having such unrealistic dreams, why don’t you buy two treasure maps from me to try your luck?” an old man selling treasure maps said with a smile.

“Buying a treasure map from you? We might as well kowtow to Earth Lord.” Zhou Wen shook his head and walked towards the Earth temple.

“Lad, take a look again. Perhaps my treasure map is really more useful than Earth Lord’s?” The elder didn’t give up as he held Zhou Wen back.

Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly as he looked at the elder.

His reaction was extremely fast. Even a Mythical creature wouldn’t be able to touch Zhou Wen, much less an elder.

The elder’s seemingly casual tug had grabbed his arm, preventing Zhou Wen from reacting. This was definitely abnormal.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t sense anything special about the elder. His ability to sense danger, which he had honed over time, didn’t work.

The more Zhou Wen looked at the elder, the more he felt as though he had seen him somewhere before. Although his looks were different, his eyes were very familiar.

These eyes... These eyes... Jing Daoxian... There’s no mistake... These are Jing Daoxian’s eyes... Zhou Wen nearly cried out.
