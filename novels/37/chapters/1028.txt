Chapter 1029: Day of the Reborn

Translator: CKtalon

Deep underground in Frost City, a white-haired man with a white beard walked out of the ice cavern.

“I’ve finally had the agreement annulled!” Frod was so excited that he almost roared at the sky.

Although he had obtained what he wanted from the deal with the Bizarre God, he still fell for a trap in the end. His body fused with the ice, turning him into an undead iceman.

Now that Bizarre God had obtained the body he wanted, the agreement was finally completed. Frod had finally regained his freedom. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Suppressing his excitement, Frod walked out of the ice cave immediately. The moment he saw the sky and the sun, he narrowed his eyes. The long-awaited sun made him so excited that he almost cried.

“How many years has it been... How many years has it been... I’m finally back... I, Frod... can finally stand at the peak of the earth again...” Frod suppressed the excitement in his heart and muttered to himself with a trembling voice.

“Father... You... You...” Gaiman couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw Frod.

Gaiman had rushed back to Frost City with his men because he wanted to ask Frod about the things he had heard as soon as possible. However, now that he saw Frod had returned to his human form and walked out of the ice cavern, there was no need for further questions. It was obvious that the masked man was right.

“Gaiman, where’s Lance? Has he returned?” Frod immediately grabbed Gaiman’s arm and asked.

“He’s back... That masked man chose Zhou Wen...” Gaiman said with a complicated expression.

He was naturally happy that Lance hadn’t died, but Zhou Wen had sacrificed himself as the price. Gaiman wanted to be happy, but he couldn’t. Frod’s actions were at odds with his beliefs.

“I knew it. I knew that the fellow would choose Zhou Wen. That’s good. That’s good. Lance is safe, and I’ve regained my freedom. This is a joyous occasion for our family. Prepare the alcohol. I want to drink...” Frod was even more excited.

Gaiman thought for a moment and sighed. “Father, Zhou Wen said that he’s a person who distinguishes kindness and hatred clearly. He will come for you.”

Frod laughed. “Come for me? I’m afraid it’s going to be in his next life. He has no idea how terrifying that Bizarre God is. Even the most top-notch humans are like ants in front of Bizarre God. Bizarre God only needs a mere thought to kill as many people as he wants. Although Zhou Wen is indeed very strong, he’s still far from that level. Or rather, it’s a power that humans can’t reach.

“Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. Go prepare the alcohol. It’s been so many years since I’ve tasted alcohol. Now that I’ve finally recovered my human form and saved Lance, I have to celebrate today.” When Frod thought of the fragrance of the alcohol, he felt a little light-headed as his saliva kept secreting.

After he became an iceman, he no longer had any sense of taste, nor could he eat. Furthermore, he was trapped in the ice cavern. His range of movement was limited to the ice cavern.

Although his family would occasionally visit him, the feeling was still unbearable. It almost drove him crazy.

Frod was an alcoholic. After enduring so many years without alcohol, he only wanted to drink to his heart’s content.

As for Zhou Wen, he wasn’t part of his considerations. After all, Zhou Wen wasn’t his descendant. It didn’t matter if he died.

Gaiman sighed inwardly and didn’t say anything else. He went to prepare food and drinks for Frod. After all, it was indeed a good thing for the Ultimate Family Clan that Frod had been revived.

Zhou Wen... What a pity... Gaiman shook his head inwardly.

Under those circumstances, Gaiman felt it was a blessing for Lance to have a friend in Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen had saved Lance.

Gaiman ordered people to prepare the best dishes and alcohol for Frod. At the same time, he arranged for the core members of his family to meet him.

As the news of Frod’s revival still needed to be kept secret, he couldn’t tell all the members of the Ultimate Family Clan. He only wanted a few core members to know about it.

Frod sat in front of the table and watched as all sorts of roasted meat and fish were served. His gastric juices were secreted crazily, almost melting his entire stomach.

“Where’s the alcohol? I want alcohol. Quickly bring it over,” shouted Frod.

“Coming.” Gaiman took out the hard liquor he had kept.

“That’s the smell. That’s the smell. How many years has it been? I can finally drink again.” Frod took the alcohol and immediately opened it to smell it. Even without drinking it, the smell of the alcohol made him so happy that he almost felt inebriated.

“Where’s Lance? Why don’t I see him?” Just as Frod was about to drink, he suddenly thought of Lance. Lance was the descendant he valued the most. It was only right for him to be present at such a joyous occasion.

“Lance was slightly injured and is resting.” Gaiman didn’t mention that Lance wasn’t willing to leave and wanted to pay back Zhou Wen with his life.

It was rare for Frod to be so happy. Furthermore, Zhou Wen was already dead. It was only a matter of time before Lance got over it. There was no need to make Frod unhappy.

“Are his injuries serious?” Frod asked with a frown.

“It’s fine. He’ll be fine after resting for half a day,” Gaiman said.

“That’s good.” Frod was already starving when he smelled the fragrance of the roasted meat and alcohol. He couldn’t wait any longer. Without any hesitation, he held the bottle and couldn’t wait to pour it out. He immediately wanted to drink it.

“Today will be the day I, Frod, am reborn...” Frod was overjoyed, but he suddenly felt the bottle in his hand being pulled away by a huge force. It left his palm open, and he didn’t even taste a drop of alcohol.

“Who is it?” Frod was extremely furious. He slammed his palm on the table and glared over.

However, when he looked over, his eyes widened and his pupils constricted. His body suddenly trembled.

Gaiman and company also turned their heads. With a glance, Gaiman exclaimed, “Zhou Wen... You... You aren’t dead...”

Zhou Wen held the bottle in Frod’s hand as he stood in front of the door with a calm expression.

“Bizarre God... You are Bizarre God, right? From the looks of it, you have been reborn. Congratulations...” Frod stood up and changed to a smile as he bowed at Zhou Wen.

He naturally believed that Zhou Wen’s body had been occupied by Bizarre God.

Only then did Gaiman come to a realization. He carefully sized up Zhou Wen and thought to himself that it was a pity.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t look at the respectful Frod. He looked at Gaiman and said, “Did you deliver the message I asked you to deliver to Frod?”

“I’ve already conveyed your words to Father. The agreement between you and him has been completed...” Gaiman said.

“That wasn’t what I said,” Zhou Wen said.

“That was what you wanted me to...” Gaiman was about to say something when a thought suddenly flashed through his mind. Although he couldn’t believe that such a thing would happen and believed that it was a delusion, he couldn’t help but have one thought when he looked at Zhou Wen.
