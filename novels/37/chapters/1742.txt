Chapter 1743 No Replication

Zhou Wen did have the urge to replicate the good things on him; it would be crazy if he could replicate a few items like the mysterious phone.

Even if the mysterious phone couldn’t be replicated, it would be awesome to have a few Immortal Culling Swords and Immortal Peril Swords.

Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t really do so. He had to figure out what was going on with this dimensional zone before he dared to experiment with the Immortal Culling Sword. Otherwise, if something went wrong, it wouldn’t be worth it.

Looking at the two Little Lis in the team, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that something was amiss. If anything could be replicated to obtain endless benefits, wasn’t this dimensional zone a little too powerful?

The Wang family was actually very uneasy. The benefits involved were just too great-so great that it was unbelievable.

If it wasn’t because Wang Lu had extremely powerful luck, they might not have dared to come despite knowing the benefits.

Everyone in the group had their own thoughts as they circled the Salt Water Lake again. When they arrived at the area where they had left their luggage, they indeed discovered two identical piles of luggage.

When they opened the luggage, everything was duplicated. However, only one item of the things that Little Li had replicated previously appeared.

“From the looks of it, there are two possibilities. One possibility is that the replica can’t be replicated. The second possibility is that the same item will only have one replicated,” Zhou Wen muttered to himself.

“It’s fine replicating one at a time. One each time means that doing it ten times gets ten. If we stay here for a few days, we won’t lack any Companion Beasts. The Wang family’s rise is just around the corner...” The Wang family was extremely excited.

Some people had already experimented with hatching a replicated Companion Egg-the outcome was identical to a normal Companion Egg.

At this moment, no one doubted the value of replicating Companion Eggs. They only wanted to replicate more Companion Eggs and things.

The only person who was more vexed was Little Li. The authenticity of the two Little Lis couldn’t be determined. All they could do was temporarily watch the duo to prevent any trouble.

“Family Head, there’s no mistake about it. This dimensional zone is our Wang family’s blessed land. Leave everything you brought behind and try your best to replicate more things. Who knows if there will be a time limit here...” an elder from the Wang family said to Wang Lu.

“There’s no rush. Let’s stick to the original plan and leave a portion behind.” Wang Lu shook her head.

Some wanted to persuade Wang Lu otherwise, but she cut them off. “The plan is to protect the family’s interests. If we don’t act according to the plan, who will be responsible if anything happens?”

The members of the Wang family looked at each other. In the end, they followed Wang Lu’s orders and left a portion behind before circling the lake again.

“What are your thoughts?” Wang Lu walked beside Zhou Wen and asked softly.

“This is very likely a spacetime dimensional zone as expected. I left a few low-level Companion Eggs there. I should discover something next time,” Zhou Wen said.

“What do you mean?” Wang Lu asked in puzzlement.

Wang Lu had noticed Zhou Wen placing a few Companion Eggs there. The Companion Eggs had also been replicated. There would be another additional one when they returned. There didn’t seem to be any difference, so she didn’t know what Zhou Wen was referring to.

Zhou Wen explained, “I only left one of those Companion Eggs and replicated Companion Eggs there.”

Wang Lu was extremely smart. Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, she immediately understood. “You left a portion of original Companion Eggs and a portion of replicated Companion Eggs. If all the Companion Eggs are replicated again, it means that there’s no limit to the replication. However, the same item can produce one replicated item. If a portion of the Companion Eggs aren’t replicated, that means that the replicas can’t be replicated.”

Zhou Wen nodded and said, “If it’s really the power of spacetime that’s at work, then be it the original or a replica, they should be replicated. No, it shouldn’t be said that it’s a replica. Or rather, it’s better to describe it as a parallel space. Those things come from a parallel space and not a replica. If the replica isn’t replicated, it’s hard to make further determination. Of course, it’s only a guess now. We still have to see the outcome.”

“Aren’t you tempted at all when you see the replicated items?” Wang Lu asked as she sized up Zhou Wen. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

At this moment, Zhou Wen was still able to come up with such ideas without being affected. It left Wang Lu alarmed.

Wang Lu’s luck was excellent. She usually didn’t lack anything, but when she saw the replicated items, her will wavered. The reason she insisted on following the plan was just to be safe.

Even so, she wasn’t as calm as Zhou Wen. “Yes, how can I not be? However...” Zhou Wen seemed to hesitate and didn’t finish his sentence.

“Just say it if it’s convenient. If it’s not convenient, don’t say it,” said Wang Lu.

“It’s nothing inconvenient. I’m just afraid that you will think too much,” Zhou Wen said after some thought. “Then just say it. I’ll definitely believe you,” Wang Lu said seriously.

“I’m just afraid that I’ll believe in it myself. I’d rather it be wrong.” Zhou Wen smiled bitterly and continued without waiting for Wang Lu to press further, “To be honest, according to my past experience, something will happen every time I enter an unfamiliar dimensional zone. It’s rather harrowing every time, so no matter how tempted I am, I still have my scruples.”

“I was wondering what it was. You gave me a fright. Don’t worry. With me by your side, your luck will turn for the better,” said Wang Lu with a smile.

“I’m not worried. I’m just afraid that you will be worried,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

The two of them chatted as they walked. After circling the area for a long time, everyone approached the place where the items were placed. Zhou Wen saw the pile of items from afar. The Companion Eggs he had placed were among them.

One... Two... Six... That’s not right... Half of them haven’t been replicated... Zhou Wen counted silently in his heart and couldn’t help but frown.

According to his previous guess, if it were spatial powers at work, the Companion Eggs he had left behind should have produced new ones, be it the original or replicas. However, half of them had clearly not been replicated.

“The replicas cannot be replicated? In other words, only the original will be replicated. Is this a spacetime power?” Wang Lu also saw Zhou Wen’s Companion Eggs and immediately knew what had happened.
