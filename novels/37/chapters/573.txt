Chapter 574 A Snail

Zhou Wen was surprised that the thing which dropped from the rhinoceros’ stomach was a living creature. Furthermore, it looked like a snail.

The fist-sized snail shell was crystalline and translucent.

The snail’s body that was exposed was transparent like a flawless crystal. After the snail fell out, it slowly crawled on the sand with its shell.

Zhou Wen retreated as though he was facing a formidable enemy. At the same time, he ordered the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and Torch Dragon to attack the snail.

Zhou Wen didn’t know the origins of the snail, but he knew one thing very well. In such a terrifying ancient battle, even a powerful creature like the rhinoceros had fossilized. Yet, this snail had survived inside the rhinoceros’ stomach.

No matter how it did it, it definitely wouldn’t have been easy.

Of course, it was also possible that the fellow had crawled in later, but no matter what, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to take the risk.

Torch Dragon and Six-Winged simultaneously spat out dragon breath at the snail. The snail immediately shrank into its shell. Two terrifying dragon breaths sprayed on the snail’s shell, melting away the surrounding bone sand and forming a huge crater.

However, after the dragon breaths stopped, the snail shell in the pit remained unharmed. The attacks of the two Mythical pets failed to penetrate the snail shell.

Bright Torch Vision World. Zhou Wen increasingly found the snail terrifying. He ordered Torch Dragon to use its Wheel of Destiny powers.

Torch Dragon’s eyes turned into a mirror as it looked at the snail in the pit, but in the blink of an eye, the snail had vanished.

The power of the Bright Torch Vision World absorbed large amounts of bone sand. A large swath of bone sand vanished as though a huge hole had been dug out of the desert.

Zhou Wen carefully observed his surroundings, but he didn’t find the snail.

Was it absorbed by the Bright Torch Vision World or had it escaped? Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless as he summoned several important Companion Beasts to prevent any mishaps.

If this lineup still allowed it to escape, it would be terrifying.

Torch Dragon and company stood around Zhou Wen and constantly scanned the nearby desert, but they didn’t find any traces of the snail.

Now, Zhou Wen missed Truth Listener a little. If he had Truth Listener’s ability, he wouldn’t be at such a disadvantage. Now, he had to be more careful.

After waiting for quite some time, the snail still didn’t appear. Zhou Wen felt that it was most likely sucked into Bright Torch Vision World with the bone sand. Otherwise, there was no reason for it not to appear.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless. He continued watching carefully. At the same time, he didn’t dare stay in the bone sand desert any longer as he headed straight for the underground sea.

Along the way, he didn’t see the snail reappear. When he arrived at the beach, Zhou Wen didn’t head into the sea. Instead, he watched the sapphire sky from the side. It was a spectacular sight.

An Sheng said that they had people who also wanted to study the sapphire sky, but the Companion Beasts they had sent would die for no reason once they approached it. After losing quite a number of Companion Beasts with no results to speak for, they had to give up exploring the sapphire sky. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhou Wen looked at it for a while, but he didn’t find anything in the sapphire sky. The gem-like crystal’s body was entirely blue, looking beautiful and profound.

He attempted to summon a Poison Bat Companion Beast and make it fly towards the sapphire sky.

Back in-game, Zhou Wen had already done similar experiments numerous times. He would only see the Poison Bat flash a faint blue light when it approached the sapphire sky. Then, they would die. He saw nothing else.

This time, Zhou Wen wanted to see it happen in reality, hoping to find some clues.

Indeed, the moment the Poison Bat Companion Beast approached the sapphire sky, a blue light suddenly flashed from its body. In the next second, the Poison Bat’s body turned into a blue transparent crystal. After it exploded into powder, it fell into the underground sea.

Zhou Wen looked carefully, but he failed to discover where the blue light had shot out from. From his point of view, the blue light appeared to come from within the Poison Bat’s body.

He tried a few more times, but the results were the same. He couldn’t identify the problem.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen felt his neck itch. He reached out to scratch it, but when his fingers touched his skin, it gave him a fright.

When his fingers touched the itchy spot, he found it extremely hard to the touch. It didn’t feel like skin, but rather like jade.

Not good! Zhou Wen thought of something as he hurriedly summoned the crystal mirror and looked at his neck’s reflection. Upon seeing the reflection, his expression changed drastically.

On the right side of his neck, there was a bulge the size of a fingernail. It was very strange. It was neither red nor swollen. It was translucent like jade and had spiral patterns on it. It was like the shell of a snail.

Is this the snail being up to no good? Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen pulled out his Orchid Blade and slashed at his neck, slicing off the jade-like flesh.

Seeing that the flesh under his skin remained tender flesh and blood, he felt a lot more at ease that it hadn’t turned to jade.

Zhou Wen directly used the Orchid Blade to shatter the sliced piece of flesh. At the same time, he summoned the Fire Furnace Queen and burned it to ashes.

Although the wound on his neck still hurt, it didn’t itch. Zhou Wen felt much better.

With Zhou Wen’s current physical strength, the tiny wound quickly contracted and stopped bleeding. It wouldn’t take long to heal itself.

However, after a while, Zhou Wen felt his wound itch again. He thought that it was the itch from the scab, but when his fingers touched it, his expression immediately turned ugly.

He picked up the crystal mirror and took a look. The wound had completely healed, but a snail shell had protruded out.

Zhou Wen immediately cut it off and summoned Doctor Darkness to inject large amounts of poison into his wound.

Zhou Wen’s body’s poison resistance was already very high, so the poison couldn’t take his life. He wanted to see if it was effective on the wound or rather, be effective on the snail-like lump.

However, he was disappointed. Despite injecting him with a large amount of poison, making him almost unable to take it, it didn’t take long for the wound to automatically heal, producing a spiral-shaped jade lump. A strange itch also triggered Zhou Wen’s nerves, making him have the urge to grab it.

I’m in big trouble. Zhou Wen knew that things were rather serious. It was definitely the snail’s doing, but he didn’t even know where the snail was. It was unknown when the snail had attacked him.

He switched to Zero Taboo and used all sorts of methods to deal with the jade lump, but it was to no avail. No matter how he tried, the jade lump would regrow and become itchier. It made Zhou Wen have the urge to chop off his neck.

Damn it. Truth Listener is still evolving. Otherwise, its Evil Nullification Life Soul might be useful. Zhou Wen felt his neck itch more and more as he clenched his fists. However, he didn’t dare grab it. He was afraid that the more he scratched at it, the worse it would become.
