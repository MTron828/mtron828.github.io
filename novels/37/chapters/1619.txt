Chapter 1620: Why Didn’t You Summon Companion Beasts?

Translator: CKtalon

“What’s he doing?” Not only did Professor Gu not understand, but even Jiang Yan frowned as he watched the livestream.

He naturally knew that Zhou Wen didn’t have the Void Salamander, but at this moment, he hadn’t summoned any Companion Beasts. To fight the three saints without finding an opportunity to escape was clearly not Zhou Wen’s style.

“Don’t tell me Old Zhou mistakenly thinks that he has an immortal body like me?” Li Xuan said with a cheeky smile.

Others might not know Zhou Wen, but he knew very well that if a fellow like Zhou Wen’s life was in danger, he would run faster than anyone. It was impossible for him to fight the enemy to the death.

Since Zhou Wen had done so, he definitely had some plans, so Li Xuan wasn’t worried at all.

Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu shared the same thoughts as Li Xuan. They had almost blind confidence in Zhou Wen, so they also believed that Zhou Wen was setting up a trap. The present disadvantage was only an illusion to entrap the enemy.

“Aren’t you going to think of a way to help him?” Xia Xuanyue looked at Li Xuan and company. She was somewhat puzzled. Are these fellows plastic brothers? They have long hoped for Zhou Wen’s death. Otherwise, why aren’t they showing the least bit of anxiety despite his prolonged battle? They have no

intention of thinking of a way to help.

Li Xuan even wore an excited expression as though he was delighted that Zhou Wen was being killed.

“Help him? Why help him? A fellow like Zhou Wen doesn’t need help,” Li Xuan said with a smile.

Xia Xuanyue sized up Li Xuan, but she was judging what he meant. Do they really think highly of Zhou Wen and think that he can handle it himself, or do they wish for him to die?

However, Zhou Wen’s situation wasn’t optimistic. It could be said that he was on the brink of death. This made Xia Xuanyue guess that the latter was more likely.

The city hasn’t even been built, but the internal conflict is already so serious? Xia Xuanyue thought.

“Coach is just practicing. He doesn’t need any help.” Feng Qiuyan’s words made Xia Xuanyue feel that the internal strife was dark and terrifying, At this point in time, was he still practicing? Would anyone practice at a time like this? He doesn’t even know how to lie, or rather, he can’t be bothered to hide it.

As the saying goes, a well-taught disciple starves their masters. This disciple has yet to finish his apprenticeship, but he’s already looking forward to his teacher’s death. Xia Xuanyue sighed inwardly.

“Coach is just fooling around with them. When he’s tired with the games, it will only take a blink of an eye for him to turn the tables,” Ming Xiu added.

At this stage, he can still turn the tables in the blink of an eye. Can what you said be any more fake? Xia Xuanyue felt indignant for Zhou Wen as she looked at the only female among them, Qin Zhen.

She knew that Qin Zhen had always considered herself Zhou Wen’s disciple. Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu could only be considered half-disciples, but she was a true disciple. Perhaps she wasn’t as heartless as Li Xuan and company.

Seeing Xia Xuanyue look at her, Qin Zhen’s eyes were filled with admiration. She said excitedly, “Senior Zhou is teaching me the essence of Transcendent Flying Immortal through actual combat. In order to let me understand it, he deliberately doesn’t use all his strength to let me see it clearly. Senior is UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

really thoughtful, just like the notebook he gave me back then.”

Xia Xuanyue looked at Qin Zhen with an odd expression. It was unknown if she was telling the truth or acting.

If she was acting, it looked sincere and heartfelt. It didn’t look fake at all.

However, those words were too fake if it weren’t an act. Only someone with a screw loose could say such words.

Now that Zhou Wen is about to be killed, are you really stupid or faking it to think that he’s going out of the way to teach you? Xia Xuanyue began to doubt her judgment. She couldn’t help but watch the battle livestream carefully.

Li Xuan and company said that Zhou Wen was deliberately hiding his strength, but no matter how Xia Xuanyue looked at it, she felt that Zhou Wen was about to be beheaded. He didn’t look like he was hiding his strength at all.

Are these four fellows really stupid, or do they want Zhou Wen to die so much? Xia Xuanyue couldn’t tell at all that Zhou Wen had any chance of survival.

“Summon a Companion Beast… Summon a Companion Beast… Summon a Companion Beast…” Professor Gu’s eyes were bloodshot as veins protruded from his forehead. He pressed his hands on the table and stood up, roaring at the top of his lungs.

He didn’t wish to be a jinx, much less jinx Zhou Wen to death, but what the hell was going on today? Deceit King was about to be killed, but he still hadn’t summoned his Companion Beasts.

This didn’t make sense. It didn’t make any sense. Now, Professor Gu was a little afraid of himself. In the past, he didn’t take it to heart when people said that he was a jinx. But now, he couldn’t explain why Deceit King hadn’t summoned his Companion Beasts. It was impossible.

“Unless…” Professor Gu’s voice was hoarse. As there were too many blood vessels, the whites of his eyes had tumed completely red. He looked ferocious and terrifying, but he was extremely uneasy.” Could it be… I’m really a jinx…”

Be it those who could understand the battle or those who couldn’t understand the battle through the slow-motion analysis, they were all puzzled. They couldn’t understand why this was happening.

“Professor Gu is really quite a jinx. Deceit King is about to fall.”

“Professor Gu… Old Master Gu… I’m begging you… Stop talking about summoning Companion Beasts…”

“Please, don’t jinx it any more!”

“It’s over, it’s over. Even Deceit King can’t withstand Professor Gu’s jinx. He’s doomed.”

“Deceit King has lost all his intelligence from being jinxed. He’s on the brink of death. He definitely can’t summon Companion Beasts. Perhaps those Companion Beasts have already gone on strike and are rebelling.”

“Professor Jinx… He lives up to his reputation… What a pity for the great Deceit King…”

Some of the female fans who supported Deceit King were about to cry. They were all begging Professor Gu to stop jinxing it.

I’m not a jinx… I’m not… Professor Gu was on the brink of a mental breakdown. He was already in a daze as he jumped onto the platform. He pressed his hands on the big screen that was used for the broadcast, producing loud snapping sounds. The video on it flickered as he roared at the top of his lungs,

“Summon your Companion Beasts for me!”

“I’s over!” Those who had witnessed Professor Gu’s jinxes felt their hearts turn cold.

Professor Gu had given his all at jinxing, This mighty jinxed roar was something even Deceit King didn’t deserve at the cost of his life.

Bang!

Zhou Wen’s body was once again struck by Old K’s scepter as his body flew to the side. And there, Jiuyang and Xiao were already ready to attack. The sun-like fist and the god-like fingers struck at Zhou Wen, who had lost his balance. Their attacks were inches away..
