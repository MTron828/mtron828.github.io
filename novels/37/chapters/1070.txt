Chapter 1071: Reversing Yin and Yang

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen turned his head. He couldn’t see the logger anymore. However, he could see gorgeous flames burning around the Tree of Immortality. Wounds appeared out of thin air on the Tree of Immortality’s body as the wooden splinters that splattered out burned in the air.

The huge Jade Rabbit had held back, afraid it would result in collateral damage on the Tree of Immortality, before it attacked its surroundings with the jade pestle, so it had failed to hit the logger.

Zhou Wen was somewhat afraid when he saw Jade Rabbit’s irritable look. He didn’t want it to snap the Tree of Immortality.

Zhou Wen knew that if he continued hesitating, the Tree of Immortality might really be chopped down by the logger. Without any hesitation, he threw an Elixir of Immortality at the dark-gold toad that Chang’e had transformed into.

After Chang’e swallowed the Elixir of Immortality, a large amount of cold air immediately surged out of her, causing her body to quickly disappear as she returned to her Terror form.

Following that, Zhou Wen saw an extremely terrifying scene. The cold air that filled the sky surged towards the Tree of Immortality like a tsunami.

Everything that encountered the cold froze immediately. As for the Tree of Immortality, it became more spirited amidst the cold.

The logger’s flames were actually suppressed by the cold air upon contact. The range of the flames became smaller and smaller. It looked like Chang’e’s power was indeed his nemesis.

Zhou Wen couldn’t see the logger or Chang’e, but he could tell that Chang’e had the upper hand from the dissipation of the frost and flames.

He summoned Jade Rabbit back, afraid that it would accidentally injure the Tree of Immortality.

The range of the flames became smaller and smaller. Finally, they were limited to a small area. The logger appeared again as though he could no longer maintain his Terror form. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Logically speaking, the logger was bound to lose if he couldn’t even maintain his Terror form, but for some reason, Zhou Wen felt his heart palpitate when he saw Wei Ge’s face. He had a nagging feeling that something was about to happen.

Seeing that the infinite cold air had already surged towards the logger, the remaining flames around him extinguished—he was about to be frozen in the cold air.

Faced with the infinite cold, the logger suddenly revealed a strange smile.

In the next second, the overwhelming cold gases completely drowned the logger’s figure. Apart from the cold gases, there was no other force. Not even a tiny flame could be seen.

The toad appeared again. At that moment, its entire body was covered in frost, as though it was an ice sculpture. Even without its Terror transformation, it still emitted a terrifying cold aura.

It became obvious how powerful the effects of the Elixir of Immortality were. Even now, the medicinal effects were constantly erupting.

What a pity. I might become a toad after taking the Elixir of Immortality. I don’t want to become a second Chang’e. Zhou Wen looked at Chang’e and saw her staring at the logger.

Zhou Wen looked over and saw that after the cold gases dissipated, the logger’s body appeared. It had already turned into an ice sculpture and was completely frozen.

However, when he saw the frozen Wei Ge’s expression, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. There was a smile on his lips that sent chills down his spine.

Crack! Crack!

A tiny shattering sound could be heard using Truth Listener. It left Zhou Wen feeling extremely uneasy.

What was even more shocking was that inside the ice sculpture, the logger’s body gradually turned into ice jade. Not only did the cold gases on him fail to injure him, but they also made his strength increase.

“How is this possible! He clearly has fire-elemental powers, and it’s a fire-elemental power that has already Terror transformed. How can he suddenly switch to ice?” Ice Maiden was alarmed as she stared at the logger in disbelief.

The toad also wore a solemn expression, but it was also somewhat puzzled. Clearly, it couldn’t figure out why the power of the logger had turned into an ice-elemental power.

“Not good.” Moon Goddess’s voice entered Zhou Wen’s ears. Almost at the same time, the ice on the logger’s body completely shattered as he regained his freedom.

At that moment, the logger’s body suffused extremely terrifying cold gases. They didn’t look any weaker than the cold gases emitted by the toad.

“I never expected that I would have to rely on the strength of this human body to redeem the situation.” The logger raised his arm and looked at his palm. “Although this body is very weak, his Life Soul is surprisingly interesting. It has the ability to reverse Yin and Yang. Even I benefited greatly from it. I really have to thank him.”

“Oh no! The Elixir of Immortality is refined from the Tree of Immortality that has the Yin attribute. It can boost Chang’e’s Yin attribute and is very useful against fire-elemental powers. However, now that the logger has switched to the ice attribute, Chang’e’s ability to suppress him has greatly weakened. It’s impossible to kill or suppress him now. Once the effects of the Elixir of Immortality fade, no one will be able to stop the logger. It looks like the Moon will really be doomed this time.” Moon Goddess sighed.

“Is there no other way?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

Although he still had two Elixirs of Immortality, they were no longer key to victory. It would be useless even if he was willing to give them both to Chang’e.

“As you can see, Jade Rabbit’s strength is excessively ferocious. If we let it stop the logger, I’m afraid the Tree of Immortality will be destroyed by it. That ice demon from the dimension has only just entered the Terror grade. It’s too weak, so it’s impossible for it to stop the logger.” Moon Goddess sighed softly. “The lunar calamity is inevitable. I wonder where my Moon Goddess Temple will go in the future.”

Chang’e transformed into her Terror form again as she charged toward the logger. The logger clenched his fist, and the power of frost condensed in his palm, transforming into a frost ax. It then disappeared, transforming into a dazzling ice beam.

Crack! Crack!

Zhou Wen couldn’t see the battle between the two Terror creatures, but the Tree of Immortality was riddled with wounds from the ice beams. The damage intensified.

As the Tree of Immortality was injured, the entire Moon began to tremble. Deep ravines appeared on the Moon as they constantly spread. It looked like the end of the world was approaching.

Is the Moon really going to be destroyed? Zhou Wen was alarmed.

“Leave. I’m afraid there won’t be a moon from now on.” Moon Goddess’s voice sounded. Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan, who had been frozen in front of the Moon Goddess Temple, had also recovered.

However, they had no idea what situation they were in. They looked at the quaking and cracking ground with eyes filled with horror.

If Earth is really like the Moon and is a Companion Egg, if those fellows in the dimension really find a way to bring it to life, then humans... Zhou Wen looked at the Moon that was on the brink of destruction and could already imagine what Earth would look like.

The earth would fracture, volcanoes would erupt, and seawater would drown everything. Humans had nowhere to hide. 99.99% of over 10 billion humans would die in a short period of time.

Perhaps a small number of people could use external forces to escape from Earth, but they would be in the ultra-minority.
