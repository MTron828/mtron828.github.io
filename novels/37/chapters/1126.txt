Chapter 1127: The Woman on the Bridge

Translator: CKtalon

This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen such a dimensional creature. He suspected that he was up to no good, so he didn’t dare trust him.

He continued walking forward with Ji Moqing. Bride Island was indeed very odd. He could see as far as the eye could see in the direction of the sea, but when he looked into the island, he could only see up to a few meters away. When he looked further into the distance, he felt that there was a fog enveloping the island. The forest and the village were faintly discernible—he couldn’t see them clearly.

After walking for a short distance, a small river appeared in front of them. The small river slowly flowed around the village. The clean green water and green bamboo made one find it unbearable to step on them. Even breathing seemed to taint the air here.

“A woman!” Ji Moqing suddenly pointed ahead and shouted.

Zhou Wen naturally saw that there really was a woman in front of him. Furthermore, she was standing on the bridge over the river.

It was a wooden bridge. It was unknown when it had been built, but the wood was the color of the original wood. There were no traces of paint. Time had left marks of wind and frost on the wood. Not only did it not affect the beauty of the wooden bridge, but it also gave off an ancient feeling.

Amidst the bamboo forest with the bridge and rivers, the woman in a kimono with red flowers embroidered on it stood on the bridge, holding a paper umbrella in her hand. Her black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall. A breeze blew past, and a few bamboo leaves fluttered. As her sleeves fluttered slightly, one could vaguely see her fair skin and graceful figure.

Although it was just her back view, it was already infinitely beautiful.

“So beautiful!” Even as a woman, Ji Moqing couldn’t help but be attracted by the woman’s back.

Zhou Wen was also sizing up the woman, but his focus wasn’t on her beauty or figure. He had been sensing her aura, but no matter how hard he sensed, she was a living woman without any dimensional creature aura.

There are still humans on this island? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.

When they approached the bridge, the woman finally turned around. Her face seemed to be filled with joy and anger, and there was a hint of delicateness in her softness.

“Why are you here? Don’t you know that Bride Island is very dangerous?” the woman said worriedly when she saw Zhou Wen and Ji Moqing. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“What danger can there be? Aren’t you here too?” Ji Moqing asked.

“I’m different from you. I’m trapped here and can’t leave. It’s best you leave quickly. Otherwise, when night falls, I’m afraid you won’t be able to escape death,” the woman on the bridge said.

“Why are you trapped here? Who trapped you here?” Ji Moqing asked again.

“It’s a dimensional creature with a lute on his back. However, this has nothing to do with you. Leave Bride Island quickly before it turns dark,” the woman on the bridge said.

“We want to leave, but the entire island is enveloped by a spatial rift. We can’t leave either,” Ji Moqing said.

At fixed distances along the way, Zhou Wen would use the Poison Bats to probe, but none of them had managed to escape. Ji Moqing naturally had seen all of this.

“Walk forward from here. After passing through the bamboo forest, you will see a mountain. Go around the mountain from the left. There’s a ferry crossing behind. If you leave Bride Island from there, you won’t encounter the spatial rift,” the woman on the bridge said.

Ji Moqing looked at Zhou Wen. Clearly, she couldn’t tell if the woman on the bridge was telling the truth.

Zhou Wen sized up the woman. He had already tried using many skills to look at her, but they all showed that she was human. However, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.

Previously, the dimensional creature had said to be careful of the woman on the bridge, but this woman had said that the dimensional creature with the lute had imprisoned her here. It was unknown who was lying.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and ignored the woman on the bridge as he continued walking forward.

“How did you get trapped here? Can you leave with us?” Ji Moqing couldn’t bear to leave the woman behind and asked.

“Unless the dimensional creature with the lute on his back is killed, I won’t be able to leave this bridge. It’s just too difficult. He’s a Terror-grade dimensional creature. You are far from his match. It’s best you leave quickly. If you are going to Nankai Island in the future, please inform my parents and tell them not to worry about me. I’m fine here. There’s no danger to my life,” the woman said.

“Why did that dimensional creature trap you here? Why didn’t he kill you?” Ji Moqing continued asking.

“Beauty is a woman’s greatest sin.” The woman sighed and didn’t explain much. Then, she urged Zhou Wen and Ji Moqing to leave quickly. “It’s getting late. Leave quickly. Otherwise, there won’t be a chance to leave after dark.”

“Let’s go,” Zhou Wen said indifferently as he continued walking forward.

He’s indeed a cold-blooded devil, Ji Moqing couldn’t help but think.

Despite encountering his own kind, and such a beautiful woman at that, Zhou Wen had no intention of saving her. Only devils would do such a thing.

Ji Moqing was only at the Mortal stage and didn’t have the ability to save the woman. All she could do was bid farewell to the woman and continue walking forward with Zhou Wen.

The woman stood on the bridge and watched them leave, but she didn’t do anything abnormal.

After walking for a short distance, they heard someone behind them. Ji Moqing turned her head and saw that the bald officer who had followed Fang Mingsu had brought a few people to the vicinity of the wooden bridge.

Ji Moqing was delighted. The bald officer was a Mythical expert. Perhaps he could save the woman.

It didn’t seem as if they had encountered the dimensional creature with the lute on its back. When they arrived in front of the wooden bridge, they exchanged a few words with the woman. A few soldiers went over to rescue the woman.

However, just as the soldiers stepped onto the wooden bridge, a strange wind gushed out of thin air, sweeping the soldiers into the river.

The river didn’t seem deep, but after a few soldiers fell in, they couldn’t crawl out. They were all Epic existences. Ignoring the fact that they knew how to swim, even if they didn’t, it shouldn’t have been difficult for them to get out of the water.

However, not only did they fail to break out of the water, but they also began sinking deeper and deeper as they struggled with all their might. They were about to sink completely.

The soldiers on the riverside wanted to save them, but be it their Companion Beasts or themselves, as long as they approached the river, they would be swept into the river by the strange wind.

Ji Moqing immediately realized that something was amiss. She looked at the woman on the bridge in disappointment and secretly rejoiced. If she hadn’t been with a cold-blooded devil like Zhou Wen, she would probably have drowned in the river.

The bald officer also realized that there was something wrong with the woman. Relying on the fact that he had fused with a Mythical creature, the scales on his body rapidly grew. He held a huge ax in his hand as he leaped up and slashed at the woman on the bridge.

The woman didn’t dodge. She only looked at the bald officer with a delicate look.

The bald officer was quite steel-hearted. He remained unmoved as he cleaved down with his ax.

However, the ax which was formed by a Mythical Companion Beast failed to slice apart the thin paper umbrella. Instead, it was held motionless in midair.

The woman smiled at the bald officer and spun the paper umbrella in her hand. The bald officer was immediately swept into the river by a strange wind.
