Chapter 1782 Advancing to the Calamity Grade

“If the Divine Path is an analogy to reaching the peak once success is reached, then the Human Path is a weakling’s growth history. The peak is the benefits that are truly in one’s hands, but the future is ultimately unpredictable.

“Life isn’t a game. There are too many accidents and there’s no chance of a redo. No one knows if there will really be a day when one will grow up. Most people in reality will collapse halfway like the girl in the illusion.”

Zhou Wen knew very well that although the woman seemed to have given him a choice between the Divine Path and the Human Path, she hadn’t really given him a choice.

Be it the Divine Path or the Human Path, they had their own flaws.

What the woman really wanted to tell him was that a third path existed—Godhood Human Path.

It fused the Divine Path and Human Path, and used the realm of deities as a foundation; yet, one had to constantly seek a breakthrough like a human.

“Could this be your path?” Zhou Wen didn’t know the woman’s origins or what experiences she had, but from the realm of the Godhood Human Path, the woman was probably as great as Zhou Wen had seen in his dreams.

“Your path has supreme glory, but that’s ultimately not my path. I’m not at your level. Even with that state of mind, it’s difficult for me to do anything.” Zhou Wen didn’t choose the Godhood Human Path mentioned by the woman. He ultimately chose the Human Path without any hesitation.

Only by visiting all the mountains could one say that there were no more mountains left in the world. Only by plucking all the flowers could one say that there were no more flowers that caught one’s eye. If one had never experienced anything, how could they dare say that they had no worries?

The Human Path implied all the good and bad of the human world. Only when one was flourishing after experiencing all that the world had to offer could they be considered having a Human Path Godhood.

With his mind set, he constantly circulated the Lost Immortal Sutra as strange powers overlapped, transforming into a strange force field.

Deep in his soul, there seemed to be a woman’s sigh. It was unknown if it was sorrow or disappointment.

Boom!

The Terror grade that had bound Zhou Wen for a long time was finally broken through. He seemed to be reborn as the world seemed to widen in his eyes. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Humans have their paths as humans. Gods have their paths as gods. I’m not a god, but I’ve stepped onto the divine path… Zhou Wen stood up and took out his phone to check his stats.

Zhou Wen: Calamity

Life Providence: Sigh of the King

Life Soul: Slaughterer

Wheel of Destiny: No Engravings (One Spin)

Terror Form: The Disqualified (Beyond S)

Calamity Zone: Human Realm (Heaven level)

Strength: 1000

After reading the information, Zhou Wen knew that he was already standing at the true peak of the Calamity grade. Like Demonic Neonate, he had all his stats at 1000. His Calamity Zone was already at the Heaven level.

Such stats could be said to be unparalleled among Calamity-grade creatures, but Zhou Wen wasn’t confident that he could withstand an attack from Transcendent Immortal.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen wasn’t fighting alone. He still had the golden trident, Demonic Neonate, and a group of Companion Beasts.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen had another important guarantee—the divine mountain dungeon that had been downloaded by the mysterious phone.

Zhou Wen had clearly taken away the most important golden Three-Eyed God on the divine mountain, but the Cube battle hadn’t ended. This was a very important problem.

If he could figure out why the Cube battle hadn’t ended, it might be key to Zhou Wen’s success in rescuing Wang Mingyuan.

After launching the divine mountain dungeon, the Lake of Fog and the golden fruit tree remained. He controlled the blood-colored avatar to come in front of the golden fruit tree and casually plucked a golden fruit.

As expected, as long as he had the golden fruit, he could leave the divine mountain dungeon at any time.

Unfortunately, the golden fruit in-game couldn’t be brought to reality. These things were meaningless to Zhou Wen.

Summoning Demonic Neonate, he pushed down the golden fruit tree and revealed the entrance to the temple. He entered the temple buried at the bottom of the lake, but he didn’t see the golden Three-Eyed God. The entire temple was empty.

There’s actually no golden Three-Eyed God in the dungeon. That’s strange. From the looks of it, the thing needed to clear the dungeon isn’t the golden trident. What could it be? Zhou Wen carefully searched the temple.

The temple was extremely huge. Every item was many times bigger than what humans used. The stone throne, stone pillars, and stone sculptures were all tools carved from black stone. Apart from that, there was nothing else.

He searched the entire temple but didn’t find anything. Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised. If it was that easy to discover the key, the divine mountain in the real world would have long been overturned by the Immortals. They would have long found it.

The battle of the Cube hadn’t ended, meaning that the Immortals hadn’t found anything. It was normal for Zhou Wen to not find anything since even Apocalypse-grade powerhouses couldn’t find it.

Apart from the monster in the Lake of Fog and the golden fruit tree, there’s no living creature in the entire dungeon. There’s no danger in the temple. What’s the point of such a dungeon existing? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up as he hurriedly left the temple’s exit and floated in the air to look at the entire island.

Could it be… The true item to clear this game dungeon… is this divine mountain… Zhou Wen sized it up for a while and muttered to himself.

The divine mountain in-game didn’t rise out of the lake like in reality. It was still beneath the lake, and there was nothing in the temple. No matter how one looked at it, the only treasure was the divine mountain itself.

However, be it in-game or in reality, the divine mountain was an unparalleled huge existence. It was probably more than ten thousand meters tall. Furthermore, the divine mountain’s material was extremely hard and heavy. Ordinary Calamity-grade creatures couldn’t damage it at all.

It was probably more difficult to uproot such a divine mountain than destroying a planet. Even the Apocalypse-grade powerhouses probably couldn’t do it, much less Zhou Wen.

If it could be stored away, Transcendent Immortal would have long done so. Why would she leave the divine mountain there?

Zhou Wen didn’t give up. He burrowed into the temple that was situated in the divine mountain’s belly and carefully observed every inch of the black stone, hoping to find some clues.

After a carpet sweep, Zhou Wen finally discovered something.

So that’s how it is. It’s no wonder the Cube battle didn’t end. I was missing something. Zhou Wen looked at the sculpture behind the black stone foundation and was immediately enlightened.

The carvings were mysterious and strange. They depicted some strange beasts. In the middle was a strange beast facing forward. It had three eyes like the Gods, but the pupils in the middle of the three eyes were hollowed out. Zhou Wen took a look and saw that the shapes, positions, and distances of the three holes matched the golden trident’s tips.

These three holes corresponded to the golden trident. If his guess was right, he had to stick the golden trident in to activate a mechanism or end the Cube’s battle.

However, Zhou Wen hadn’t taken that step after obtaining the golden trident. Therefore, the Cube battle hadn’t ended.

However, there’s no golden Three-Eyed God in-game, so there’s no golden trident. How do I clear the level? Zhou Wen thought for a while but failed to figure it out.

Since the golden trident couldn’t be brought into the game, Zhou Wen couldn’t experiment. He could give it a try in reality, but he didn’t know what would happen.

Unable to find any other clues, Zhou Wen had no choice but to give up and call Li Xuan over.

“Li Xuan, if I don’t return this time, there’s nothing to worry about. My dad can take care of himself, and Ya’er has someone to take care of her. As for you, I’m a little worried. There’s something you have to promise me,” Zhou Wen said solemnly.
