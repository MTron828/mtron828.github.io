Chapter 888: Too Weak

Translator: CKtalon

“I just arrived in Luoyang. I haven’t even managed to return to campus.” Zhou Wen stood to the side when he saw that it was Feng Qiuyan and company.

“Coach, look at those two Companion Beasts. Which one of them can win?” Gulli often heard Feng Qiuyan call him Coach, and now, he was also very comfortable with addressing him the same way.

“I don’t know. I’ve never seen these two Companion Beasts before,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.

“You can make a guess even if you haven’t seen it before. With your standards, you should be close to the mark just by looking,” Gulli said with a smile.

Gulli’s words were a little exaggerated, attracting the attention of others.

Xu Ai, who wasn’t far away, heard Gulli’s words and turned to look at Zhou Wen and company.

Are all Federation students so arrogant and conceited? Xu Ai thought to herself. She sized up Zhou Wen and company and didn’t pay much attention to them. She only imagined that they were a group of students bragging.

She had seen Zhou Wen’s information and photo before coming, but back then, he was wearing Sunset College’s uniform and looked very spirited.

Now that Zhou Wen had been on the run for so many days, he didn’t have the time to groom himself. He looked a little sloven and his condition made him look older than his actual age. Furthermore, he had Ya’er in his arms. Those who didn’t know him would think that he was a young father who didn’t know how to take care of his daughter.

Therefore, Xu Ai didn’t think of Zhou Wen immediately. She only believed that Zhou Wen was Feng Qiuyan and company’s tutor.

Zhou Wen looked at the challenger and the challenged. The challenged was a Thunderbird, and the one challenging the Thunderbird was a Windthunder Raven. Both of them had lightning attributes and were birds. They were considered relatively similar Mythical pets.

“They both have lightning-elemental powers. The Windthunder Raven also has wind-elemental powers. Its speed is also faster than the Thunderbird. I think the chances of the Windthunder Raven winning are higher. Coach, what do you think?” Gulli said again.

“I think the Thunderbird will win,” Zhou Wen said.

“Why?” Gulli asked in puzzlement.

In fact, it wasn’t only Gulli who was puzzled. Xu Ai, who had heard their conversation, thought otherwise. She also believed that the Windthunder Raven would win.

As the Windthunder Raven was an overseas Companion Beast, Xu Ai was very familiar with it. The Windthunder Raven had the power of wind and lightning. It was somewhat different from pure lightning-elemental beasts. It could even be said to restrain pure lightning. Therefore, although Xu Ai didn’t know much about the Thunderbird, she still felt that the Windthunder Raven had a higher chance of winning.

Since Zhou Wen was so certain that the Thunderbird would win, Xu Ai naturally thought nothing of it.

Zhou Wen looked at the Thunderbird on the screen and said, “That’s because that Thunderbird has the aura of inevitable victory. When meeting face to face, the bravest wins. If the difference in strength between the Thunderbird and the Windthunder Raven isn’t too great, the Thunderbird will definitely win.”

“So it’s because of the aura,” Feng Qiuyan said as he fell into deep thought, as though he had understood something.

“Unfortunately, there’s no way to place a bet here. Otherwise, I would place my bet on Thunderbird’s victory and earn some pocket money,” Gulli said regretfully.

To think that such a person can be a tutor at Sunset College. From the looks of it, Sunset College doesn’t deserve its reputation. When Xu Ai heard their words, she stopped paying attention to them. She felt that Zhou Wen was spouting nonsense. If he could determine victory based solely on aura, what was the point of having strength?

As the few of them conversed, the battle between the Thunderbird and the Windthunder Raven had already begun. The Windthunder Raven immediately launched an attack. Its flying speed was extremely fast, and with the sound of wind and thunder accompanying it, it was much faster than the Thunderbird.

After using its speed to bypass the Thunderbird’s line of sight, the Windthunder Raven launched a violent bombardment. With a flap of its wings, wind and lightning transformed into blades of light that attacked the Thunderbird from behind like a storm. The Windthunder Blades that filled the sky blocked the Thunderbird’s path.

The Thunderbird had no intention of retreating. Lightning surged from its body as it faced the storm. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Boom!

Lightning flashed and thunder crackled as the wind blades shattered. Sparks flew as the Thunderbird went against the wind, piercing through the wind blades that filled the sky and rushing in front of the Windthunder Raven.

The Windthunder Raven wanted to use its speed to dodge the Thunderbird’s attack before counterattacking.

However, to everyone’s surprise, the Thunderbird charged forward without any hesitation. It didn’t dodge the Windthunder Raven’s Windthunder Blades at all. It would rather suffer some injuries to forcefully close the distance.

Although the Windthunder Raven was faster, it could only dodge under the pressure of the Thunderbird. As for the Thunderbird, it became braver as it charged. The lightning on its body condensed as it streaked across the sky in the shape of a bird. If it managed a hit, even the hardest steel would probably explode.

In the beginning, the Windthunder Raven could still use its speed to dodge, but as the lightning powers on the Thunderbird grew stronger, its flying speed also increased. It was very difficult for the Windthunder Raven to dodge the Thunderbird’s attacks.

Before long, the owner of the Windthunder Raven saw that there was no chance of victory, so he directly admitted defeat and retracted it.

“As expected of Coach. You have keen eyes.” Gulli gave him a thumbs up.

Xu Ai thought otherwise. She didn’t believe that Zhou Wen had determined the victor based on aura. She thought to herself, If it wasn’t for his good luck, he would have long known the abilities of the Thunderbird and Windthunder Raven. That’s why he made such a judgment.

After watching the battle, Xu Ai was about to leave when she suddenly heard Sadie ask Zhou Wen, “Coach, what do you think of Great Skyfiend that’s ranked first?”

Upon hearing Sadie’s words, Xu Ai couldn’t help but slow down. Her ears pricked up as she felt a little smug. These people from the Federation should be afraid of Great Skyfiend’s invincibility and strength, right?

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked.

Sadie thought for a moment and said, “Coach, do you think Great Skyfiend can maintain first place until the end of the ranking battle?”

“No,” Zhou Wen answered directly.

“Why?” Sadie asked in surprise when she saw Zhou Wen’s straightforward answer.

“Because it’s too weak,” Zhou Wen answered truthfully.

He had seen too many powerful Guardians. If one couldn’t reach the Terror grade, they were naturally weak in Zhou Wen’s opinion. It was impossible for it to obtain first place, and Great Skyfiend clearly hadn’t reached the Terror grade.

Too... weak... When Xu Aai heard this, she nearly exploded from anger. If this were overseas, she wouldn’t hesitate to summon Great Skyfiend to let Zhou Wen know how terrifying the so-called weak Guardian was.

Unfortunately, this was the Federation. Xu Ai could only endure it. She thought to herself, I can’t lower myself to the level of these ignorant Federation people.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s answer, Gulli gave him a thumbs up and said, “Sis, aren’t you asking an unnecessary question? In front of Coach, Great Skyfiend or whatever is definitely weak. Unfortunately, pure humans can’t participate in the battle. Otherwise, if Coach were to go up, he would be able to beat up the Great Skyfiend and Uesugi Nao to a pulp. They’d kneel and call him daddy.”
