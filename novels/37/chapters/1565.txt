Chapter 1566: Who’s the Unlucky One?

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen originally wanted to leave through the teleportation nexus, but when he saw that Jiuyang had already begun fighting Starlord Ravenous Wolf, he decided to stand in a corner by the door and watch their battle.

Starlord Ravenous Wolf was a martial repository. No matter what technique he used, it appeared perfect and flawless. It could even be considered stunning.

“I never knew that it could be used this way!” Those who could truly understand Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s battle couldn’t help but praise him from time to time.

Although Zhou Wen had already seen it once, he still found it stunning when he saw it again.

Jiuyang wasn’t at a disadvantage when fighting Starlord Ravenous Wolf. He wasn’t as stunning as Starlord Ravenous Wolf. His every move was standard; they didn’t provide any surprises.

It was like the sun rising in the morning every day before setting in the evening. It was never absent, nor did it bring about surprises.

He was a man that didn’t bring about pleasant surprises or subvert expectations. Yet, his simple techniques were on par with Starlord Ravenous Wolf. No matter how shocking Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s attacks were, it was difficult for him to truly suppress Jiuyang. They were evenly matched.

What was even more terrifying was that due to the Sun God Armor, the high-temperature radiation that Starlord Ravenous Wolf emitted made the Sun God Armor’s power grow stronger.

Starlord Ravenous Wolf had the upper hand for a short period of time, but over time, Jiuyang would definitely hold the advantage.

“As expected of a man with Sun God. He’s really powerful.”

“The Four Dinosaur Kings defeated Starlord Ravenous Wolf four against one. Jiuyang alone can fight Starlord Ravenous Wolf. Furthermore, it looks like he has a chance of winning. This is the difference.”

“In comparison, Unlucky Egg is…”

Zhou Wen couldn’t hear the discussions on the Internet. Even if he could hear it, he wouldn’t take it to heart. He was watching with relish.

This person should be Saint Jiuyang on the rankings, right? I never expected that such a figure would pop up from the Holy Land in such a short period.?Zhou Wen watched carefully from the side.

Most of the Saints who came from the Holy Land were enemies. If he could learn more about them now, it would be knowing himself and his enemy before they really fought in the future.

After watching for a while, Zhou Wen felt a heartfelt admiration for Jiuyang.

Zhou Wen had seen many Guardians. The humans who had contracted Guardians were basically focused on developing the abilities of Guardians. They studied how to maximize the strength of the Guardians.

Of course, Jiuyang did the same. However, other than that, he didn’t give up on his cultivation.

His strength came from a Guardian, but his technique and concepts had also reached an extremely high level. Even without the Guardian’s power to support him, his technique and concept remained top-notch.

Where did the Holy Land find these people? Figures like Xiao and Jiuyang are all talented among us humans. What a pity…?Zhou Wen felt a little regretful.

Unfortunately, these people were Saints from the Holy Land. They were different from Jiang Yan and the other Guardians. Jiang Yan and the others had only contracted Guardians. As long as the Guardians were on their side, they could completely control their fates and not be controlled by the dimension.

The Saints of the Holy Land weren’t that simple. Even if their Guardians were willing to follow them, it would probably be difficult for them to betray the Holy Land.

In any case, Zhou Wen had never heard of the Holy Land having any traitors.

Previously, An Tianzuo had captured a few Saints, but he had failed to dig out anything. Even if there were Saints who were willing to join him, they were later proven to be spies. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Holy Land’s control over Saints definitely exceeded the imagination of ordinary people.

After watching for a while, Zhou Wen knew that with the Guardian’s strength, Jiuyang would likely win in the end.

There was no point in continuing watching. Zhou Wen floated towards the teleportation nexus, planning on leaving Dubhe Palace and returning to Earth.

Just as he floated forward a few meters, before Zhou Wen could approach the teleportation nexus, he suddenly saw a light flash from the throne. Another Starlord Ravenous Wolf had appeared.

After the second Starlord Ravenous Wolf appeared, he immediately charged down without a word.

As Zhou Wen was relatively far from the newly-appeared Starlord Ravenous Wolf, the newly-appeared Starlord Ravenous Wolf pounced at Jiuyang, who was relatively close to him.

Jiuyang, who had already gained a slight advantage in a one-on-one battle, was immediately thrown into danger when he was besieged by two Starlord Ravenous Wolves.

“What’s going on? Why are there two Starlord Ravenous Wolves? Previously, the Four Dinosaur Kings attacked Starlord Ravenous Wolf together, but there wasn’t a second Starlord Ravenous Wolf!”

“How can that be the same? The Four Dinosaur Kings are a team, and Unlucky Egg and Jiuyang are actually two different teams. It’s normal for two Starlord Ravenous Wolves to appear.”

“Jiuyang is being besieged by two Starlord Ravenous Wolves. It looks like he won’t be able to last much longer.”

“Why are the two Starlord Ravenous Wolves attacking Jiuyang and not that Unlucky Egg?”

Everyone discussed spiritedly. Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He never expected such a development.

It wasn’t just Zhou Wen who hadn’t expected it. Jiuyang was caught by surprise. Although the Sun God Armor could restrain Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s high-temperature radiation blast, Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s other strengths were no trifling matter.

Furthermore, Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s combat prowess was indomitable. Jiuyang could handle a one-on-one battle, but against two, he immediately fell into a perilous situation. Even if he wanted to rush towards the teleportation nexus, there was no chance.

The second Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s combat strength wasn’t weaker than the first. The two Starlords worked together flawlessly as they constantly suppressed Jiuyang.

Bang!

Starlord Ravenous Wolf punched Jiuyang’s shoulder. Streams of light over the Sun God Armor shattered as Jiuyang was thrown a few steps back.

Thankfully, Jiuyang’s foundation was sufficiently powerful. The Sun God Armor was indeed powerful. This punch only slightly injured Jiuyang without leaving serious injuries.

Jiuyang stabilized his body and dodged the pursuit of another Starlord Ravenous Wolf. He threw out both fists and exchanged countless punches with the first Starlord Ravenous Wolf. Light blasts and shockwaves erupted continuously, causing the entire hall to rumble as though it was about to collapse.

The two Starlord Ravenous Wolves were like one. Jiuyang retreated under their barrage of attacks.

“Haha, Jiuyang is trapped in his own web. He never expected two Starlord Ravenous Wolves to appear in the arena. From the way the Starlord Ravenous Wolf appeared, if he had killed Zhou Wen outside, the second Starlord Ravenous Wolf probably wouldn’t have appeared,” Xia Liuchuan said gloatingly.

Zhang Chunqiu said with a bitter smile, “Jiuyang might not have thought of it, but neither did we. Thankfully, Jiuyang was ahead. Zhou Wen still has a chance of rushing into the teleportation nexus.. Otherwise, he’ll still be doomed when those two Starlord Ravenous Wolves kill Jiuyang.”
