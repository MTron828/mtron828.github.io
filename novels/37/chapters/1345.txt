Chapter 1346: Chat After Lying Down

Translator: CKtalon

“What’s it doing there? I clearly saw you eating it!” Gao Dawei’s expression changed slightly.

“What the eyes see might not be the truth,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

Gao Dawei smiled again in the blink of an eye. He pointed at Ya’er and said, “Even if you can remove the chocolate, she ate it…”

Before Gao Dawei could finish his sentence, he saw Zhou Wen outstretch his other hand. There was another piece of chocolate there, the one Ya’er had put in her mouth.

Zhou Wen was becoming more and more adept at using Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping.

In the past, he could only make a mark before exchanging. Now that he had the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, there was no need to go through so much trouble. As long as it was within the range of the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, Zhou Wen could directly do a swap.

“You… When did you realize that there was something wrong with me?” Gao Dawei immediately knew that he had been exposed. Otherwise, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have taken Ya’er’s chocolate away in advance.

“Not long ago. It was when you offered me Snow White.” Zhou Wen was telling the truth.

Gao Dawei had done everything too naturally without any flaws. In order to lower Zhou Wen and company’s guard, he had even used the smelly chocolate in advance.

If it was an ordinary person, they would write it off as a false alarm. They would have a period when they would let their guard down, making any ploy easier to succeed.

Gao Dawei hadn’t done anything wrong. Everything was fine and natural. However, when he gave Zhou Wen the chocolate in the end, he was too eager for him to accept it.

Although he didn’t show it superficially, he was eager to get Zhou Wen to accept it deep down. Therefore, Zhou Wen heard his thoughts and confirmed that there was something wrong with him.

Of course, even if he didn’t hear his thoughts, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on letting Ya’er eat the last piece of chocolate. Zhou Wen already felt that something was amiss when he saw the stinky chocolate, but he just didn’t have any substantial evidence.

“As expected, I was greedy. I shouldn’t have given you the chocolate. I should have known that you, Zhou Wen, wouldn’t be killed so easily by me,” Gao Dawei said with a sigh.

Before Zhou Wen could say anything else, Gao Dawei suddenly flared up and grabbed the unconscious Sweetie.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen unsheathed his Bamboo Blade and slashed at Gao Dawei’s arm, forcing him to retreat.

Zhou Wen’s strike wasn’t to save Sweetie, but to save Gao Dawei.

It wasn’t easy to encounter a saint, so Zhou Wen naturally wanted to capture him alive. He hoped to obtain some information. It would be even better if he could obtain information about the former principal.

As for how terrifying Sweetie was, Zhou Wen had seen it with his own eyes. The Calamity-grade bullets that used to surround him had failed to injure her.

Zhou Wen didn’t believe that a piece of chocolate from Gao Dawei could take Sweetie down. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He was afraid that Gao Dawei would be killed by her and he would not be able to get anything out of him.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t know that his strike had improved Sweetie’s impression of him. She thought to herself,?This person isn’t too bad. He’s good to that young lady and is willing to save me…

Sometimes, being too high-leveled was also a kind of frustration.

It was like an emperor in ancient times: Upon hearing that the victims of a natural disaster did not have rice to eat and had starved to death, he asked them why they didn’t eat meat.

To Sweetie, it was a matter of course, but she didn’t know that she had already exposed her terrifying strength because of those incidents.

Of course, Sweetie was, in fact, even more terrifying than Zhou Wen imagined.

The Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand slashed repeatedly, but Gao Dawei’s fat body was shockingly fast. He was like a legendary flying pig. When he rushed into the air, his chef’s uniform had already turned into a chocolate armor that enveloped his body.

The Bamboo Blade struck skyward and slashed toward Gao Dawei again. Gao Dawei surprisingly grabbed the Bamboo Blade with his hands that were wrapped in chocolate.

The moment the Bamboo Blade touched Gao Dawei, the hard blade turned into melted chocolate and dripped to the ground.

If Zhou Wen hadn’t retracted his saber fast enough, the entire Bamboo Blade would probably have turned into melted chocolate. Even though he retracted it fast enough, a lot of the chocolate-turned blade had already dripped to the ground, making the Bamboo Blade’s blade turn into a sawtooth.

Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly. The Bamboo Blade had been with him for so long, but this was the first time it had been damaged so badly. He had previously used the Bamboo Blade to fight a Terror-grade without it suffering so much damage.

Gao Dawei’s body moved quickly and wherever his body touched, the walls, tables, and chairs would turn into chocolate—melting chocolate.

Zhou Wen put away the Bamboo Blade. It had been with him for so long, so he had some feelings for it. He didn’t want it to be destroyed just like that.

Zhou Wen’s figure flashed as he dodged Gao Dawei’s repeated attacks. At the same time, he transformed his aura into a sword and used the sword beam to attack Gao Dawei’s vital points.

As he did not dare to touch his body, he could only use sword beam techniques.

Like Xiao, Gao Dawei was at the Terror grade. His movement technique and means were in no way inferior. Furthermore, despite his figure, his movement technique was surprisingly good.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that only saints from the Trajectory Holy Temple were good at movement techniques. He never expected that Gao Dawei, who came from the Sun God Holy Temple, was also good at movement techniques. Furthermore, he had a completely different style from the Trajectory Holy Temple.

Zhou Wen used his finger as a sword and brandished his sword aura wantonly, forcing Gao Dawei back.

Gao Dawei wanted to rush out of the shop, but he realized that Zhou Wen’s sword beams seemed random, but they sealed off all his paths of retreat. He couldn’t attack or even escape.

The more Gao Dawei fought, the more discomfort he felt. He felt as if he had been locked up in a cage filled with metal spikes and could not move at all.

“Gao Dawei, I see that you are somewhat different from the other saints. Why don’t we make a deal? Answer a few questions of mine and I’ll ensure your safe departure,” Zhou Wen said.

“What do you want to know?” Gao Dawei’s eyes flickered. Clearly, he wanted to stall for time.

“There’s no rush. Let’s chat slowly after you lie down,” Zhou Wen said calmly.

Gao Dawei was first taken aback before he laughed out in anger. “Zhou Wen, you are indeed impressive, but if you think you have me in your grasp, you are sorely mistaken. You can dodge a Calamity-grade bullet, but you might not be able to dodge my strike.”

With that said, Gao Dawei’s body suddenly turned into a coffee-colored liquid like high-temperature chocolate. Like a swamp monster or a liquid demon, he transformed into a tornado that swept towards Zhou Wen.

Clearly, Gao Dawei knew very well that single-target attacks were useless against Zhou Wen. Only AOE attacks could hit him.. As long as Zhou Wen had a drop of chocolate liquid on him, he would turn into chocolate.
