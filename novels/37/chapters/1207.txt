Chapter 1208: Treatment

Translator: CKtalon

“Little Zuozuo, there’s no need to stand on ceremony. We are family,” Ouyang Lan said as she took the arm from An Sheng and stuffed it into Zhou Wen’s hand. She continued, “Little Wenwen, ignore him. If he’s sick, he needs to be treated. Who doesn’t let doctors treat them? Please, treat him.”

With that said, Ouyang Lan winked at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss as to what Ouyang Lan’s wink meant.

When the others heard Ouyang Lan call An Tianzuo Little Zuozuo, their expressions changed, but they didn’t dare say a word.

“I said there’s no need.” An Tianzuo got up to leave. He knew Ouyang Lan too well.

However, it was already too late. Ouyang Lan had already pressed down on An Tianzuo’s shoulder. An Tianzuo didn’t dare to shake her off by force. All he could do was say, “It’s just one arm. It’s no big deal. There’s no need to treat it.”

Ouyang Lan ignored An Tianzuo and said to Zhou Wen, “Little Wenwen, I call the shots. Ignore him and quickly treat him. I saw that you were great at treating wounds, so please treat Little Zuozuo.”

When Zhou Wen heard Ouyang Lan’s words, he immediately came to a realization. Ouyang Lan was referring to the time he beat up the Asura.

Then does she mean that she wants me to take the opportunity to beat up An Tianzuo? Zhou Wen held the severed arm and looked at An Tianzuo, understanding what Ouyang Lan meant.

Zhou Wen originally believed that even if he wanted to beat An Tianzuo up, he should have done it openly without using such tricks.

However, on second thought, I’m not beating him up; I’m treating him.

With this in mind, Zhou Wen no longer hesitated. He walked in front of An Tianzuo with the severed arm.

“Mom, I’m fine. There’s really no need to treat me.” An Tianzuo wanted to convince Ouyang Lan, but it was useless.

“Overseer An, bear with it. It does hurt a little during the treatment, but you’ll be fine soon,” Zhou Wen said as he threw a punch at An Tianzuo’s face.

Everyone was stunned. That was An Tianzuo, Overseer An, the War God from Luoyang.

An Tianzuo was stunned. He never expected Zhou Wen to suddenly hit him, so he failed to react.

“Little Zuozuo, this is a treatment. Don’t move.” When An Tianzuo reacted and tried to stand up, Ouyang Lan pressed down on his shoulder.

Zhou Wen felt every cell in his body crackle with exuberance and ignored everything else. He quickly threw out a punch that rained down on An Tianzuo’s face and stump, causing his angular face to cave in.

If looks could kill, Zhou Wen would have died ten thousand times over. If Ouyang Lan hadn’t held An Tianzhuo back, he would have long turned hostile.

An Tianzuo could tell that Zhou Wen wasn’t treating his injuries. He was clearly abusing the mandate he received for personal revenge.

Bam!

Zhou Wen’s final punch struck An Tianzuo’s high nose, causing it to collapse.

Seeing that An Tianzuo couldn’t hold back, Zhou Wen took two steps back and muttered to himself, “From the looks of it, it’s mostly done.”

With that said, Zhou Wen shattered the broken arm in his hand and threw it at An Tianzuo. The broken arm automatically connected to the wound that had also been shattered by Zhou Wen.

In a moment, An Tianzuo’s severed arm recovered. His face that had caved in from Zhou Wen’s strike also returned to its original state. The injuries from his battle with Xiao had completely vanished.

“Little Wenwen’s treatment is really excellent. You don’t look injured at all. We’re family, so there’s no need to thank him.” Ouyang Lan didn’t dare tease An Tianzuo further when she saw his cold expression. She hurriedly released her grip and pulled Zhou Wen away. “The weather today is rather fine, don’t you think so, Ah Sheng?”

“Indeed, Madam. The weather is excellent today. Why don’t we go back and have a good meal?” An Sheng hurriedly followed Ouyang Lan, not daring to stay behind to face the fuming An Tianzuo.

“Ah Sheng, you are most considerate. Little Zuozuo just doesn’t understand me.” Ouyang Lan walked as she spoke without stopping.

The group left Netherworld City and rushed back to Luoyang.

The stat crystal left behind by the Asura was a 96 Constitution Crystal. After Zhou Wen absorbed it, his Constitution only reached 81 points without any further breakthroughs.

The other skill crystal was named “Asura’s Evil”. It was a Terror-grade skill crystal that required 81 Constitution. It also required one to cultivate an Essence Energy Art with a demonic attribute, as well as a demonic Wheel of Destiny.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and realized that he had never cultivated a demonic Essence Energy Art. After giving it a try, he realized that he couldn’t absorb it. All he could do was temporarily put it away.

Should I open up Netherworld City in-game? Zhou Wen was very interested in the dimensional creatures in the Six Realms. There were many Mythical creatures there, and there were also Terror-grade ones that could be killed. It was an excellent place for farming resources.

However, when he thought of Netherworld City’s punishments, Zhou Wen had no choice but to temporarily give up. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ignoring everything else, it wouldn’t be easy to clear the final dream chamber. Zhou Wen didn’t have Li Xuan’s ability that was similar to an AI brain and datastream powers. Just the thought of being punished in a dream for more than a thousand years made even someone as determined as Zhou Wen shiver.

After returning to Luoyang, the An family began to study the possibility of entering the Holy Land.

At the very least, they had to let a Terror-grade human enter the Holy Land. Otherwise, they would only be sending themselves to their deaths.

“Sis Lan, do you know what they want from the former principal?” Zhou Wen privately asked Ouyang Lan when no one else was around.

Ouyang Lan shook her head slightly. “I don’t know either. From what they said, I’m guessing that my father obtained something from Zhuolu.”

Zhou Wen whispered, “Could it be the silver-haired Companion Beast in Xiyuan’s shop?”

Ouyang Lan was slightly taken aback. “Why would you have such thoughts? Typically, Companion Beasts can’t be traded. The chances of them seeking a Companion Beast isn’t high.”

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that Ouyang Lan was right. The Companion Beast they wanted was probably the strongest Companion Beast on Earth. The silver-haired Companion Beast didn’t seem to make the cut.

The thing they are looking for is definitely related to the strongest Companion Beast on Earth, but what is it? What did the former principal take out from Zhuolu? Zhou Wen thought about it but couldn’t figure it out.

“Why did you think of that silver-haired Companion Beast?” Ouyang Lan was a shrewd person. Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s question, she felt that there was something amiss.

Zhou Wen recounted the matter about the passcode. Ouyang Lan was the former principal’s daughter, so she should know the former principal better.

“That actually happened? Are you sure that the passcode was given to you by my father?” Ouyang Lan was very surprised when she heard that.

“I’m not sure.” Zhou Wen shook his head. He really couldn’t be sure.

“This matter is odd. There’s something wrong with that silver-haired Companion Beast. It’s right that you didn’t rashly open it.” Ouyang Lan pondered and was about to say something when she heard hurried footsteps from outside.

“Madam, the Cube has been activated again..” An Sheng’s voice sounded from outside.
