Chapter 1521 Berserker Technique

“Why? Have you thought it through?” Berserker Immortal stood in the sea of blood sword beams and said to Zhou Wen who was also surrounded by them.

“Yes, I’ve figured it out.” Zhou Wen nodded.

“What have you figured out? Do you want to fight to the bitter end and wait for your family and friends to go to hell together, or do you want to cooperate with me?” Berserker Immortal asked.

“That isn’t what I figured, but how to kill you.” Zhou Wen gripped the Golden Wyrm Scissors in his hand tightly as all his Essence Energy crazily condensed into it.

“You said something similar previously. It doesn’t seem to be effective,” Berserker Immortal said indifferently.

“Perhaps the effects will be better now.” Zhou Wen didn’t mind Berserker Immortal’s mockery as he continued injecting his Essence Energy into the Golden Wyrm Scissors.

“Some things shouldn’t be randomly experimented on. If you want to try, you have to be prepared to die. I won’t give you a chance to live.” Berserker Immortal was already filled with killing intent.

Zhou Wen’s strength had exceeded Berserker Immortal’s expectations. He found it difficult to truly control him. Even if he barely subdued him, he might be the next Jiang Yan.

Therefore, if Zhou Wen still didn’t yield, Berserker Immortal planned on killing him. Then, he would choose Li Xuan, Ming Xiu, and Feng Qiuyan as the new representatives of the Immortals in the human world.

“Death is nothing to humans. Ever since humans were born, they knew that they would die. Humans cherish their lives more because life is short, but that doesn’t mean they are afraid of death. As for you, you are different. You have never imagined dying, right? That’s why you should be mentally prepared to die,” Zhou Wen said calmly.

“Humph!” Berserker Immortal snorted coldly as he retracted his finger. Thousands of sword beams slashed at Zhou Wen.

Berserker Immortal had already made up his mind. If this strike couldn’t kill Zhou Wen, he would turn around and return to Earth’s Guide City before bringing Ming Xiu and company under control.

To Berserker Immortal’s surprise, Zhou Wen didn’t choose to continue using spatial skills to escape.

Zhou Wen ignored the blood sword beams that surged over from all directions like a tidal wave. He raised the Golden Wyrm Scissors in his hand and fused with it as he stabbed at Berserker Immortal.

A golden beam tore through the tidal-like blood sword beam and instantly appeared in front of Berserker Immortal. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“You are still too naive. That strange Companion Beast weapon can withstand my sword beams, but your body can’t… Enclose…” Berserker Immortal retreated as he spoke softly and clenched his fingers.

Zhou Wen and the Golden Wyrm Scissors, who were surrounded by the blood sword beams, were immediately enveloped by them.

The sword beams that were as tiny as neutrinos were everywhere as they struck Zhou Wen and the Golden Wyrm Scissors. The Golden Wyrm Scissors was extremely strong, so the sword beams couldn’t injure it. It could still tear through the sword beams ahead of it.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t have such a strong physique. The infinite sword beams tore through the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation and when they touched his body, they immediately stabbed in. In an instant, Zhou Wen’s armor and flesh were dyed blood-red by the sword beams.

It was the phenomenon of the sword beams entering his body. Following that, Zhou Wen’s body would shatter into dust.

Zhou Wen seemed to be at the end of his rope against the endless blood sword beams.

Although Berserker Immortal didn’t let down his guard, he couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief. It was best not to keep a human like Zhou Wen around. Zhou Wen choosing to fight him to the death suited his intentions.

Although things didn’t work out the way I expected, it’s best if this human dies. Berserker Immortal watched as the countless blood sword beams stabbed into Zhou Wen’s body. Zhou Wen’s death seemed to be a foregone conclusion, but for some reason, he still felt uneasy.

Berserker Immortal was very confident in his sword beams. Even a Calamity-grade creature would definitely be doomed if so many sword beams entered their bodies, much less a Terror-grade creature.

However, he was still somewhat uneasy. Berserker Immortal didn’t believe that Zhou Wen would be so foolish as to let him kill him in such a manner based on Zhou Wen’s previous actions.

However, Berserker Immortal couldn’t figure out how Zhou Wen could reverse such a hopeless situation.

Just as Berserker Immortal was pondering over it, he suddenly realized that Zhou Wen’s body had undergone a strange change.

The armor on Zhou Wen’s body had already exploded. His already red body should have exploded with the armor, but it didn’t.

Zhou Wen’s body instantly turned into a blinding white liquid. It was the same liquid that was everywhere on Dubhe. The liquid exploded as energy and sword beams scattered everywhere like a blood sun.

As for Zhou Wen and the Golden Wyrm Scissors, they appeared in the area behind Berserker Immortal. Then, they used instant transmission to appear right behind him. The Golden Wyrm Scissors tore through the sword beams and slashed at Berserker Immortal’s head again.

Berserker Immortal immediately reacted as he moved at high speeds. Infinite sword beams enveloped Zhou Wen again.

However, this time, the sword beams remained useless. When the sword beams invaded Zhou Wen’s body, his body turned into a blob of liquid.

Zhou Wen had used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to an extremely ingenious level. He charged all the way and left a large number of spatial marks in Dubhe’s liquid. Every time the sword beams entered his body, he would swap with a blob of liquid and have the intrusive sword beams be trapped inside the liquid. His true body would arrive at a safe spot.

Zhou Wen constantly switched positions and constantly instant transmitted. Like a ghost, he attacked Berserker Immortal crazily.

Berserker Immortal was surprised to discover that Zhou Wen’s attack technique was 90% similar to his Berserker Technique.

“You must be dreaming if you think you can defeat me using my sword technique.” Seeing that his sword beams had lost their effect, Berserker Immortal extended his hand and beckoned. Thousands of sword beams condensed into the Sword of Blood again.

Clang!

However, when Berserker Immortal swung his sword and stabbed at Zhou Wen again, the Golden Wyrm Scissors blocked his Sword of Blood and sliced off a portion of it.

“How is this possible!” Berserker Immortal was shocked.

His Berserker technique should have been one step ahead of Zhou Wen’s Golden Wyrm Scissors, but Zhou Wen had actually blocked his sword. This left Berserker Immortal in disbelief.

The broken Blood Sword transformed into thousands of sword beams before fusing into one again. Berserker Immortal struck again and again.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Berserker Immortal’s every strike was blocked by Zhou Wen’s Golden Wyrm Scissors. Every time the Sword of Blood was sliced off, Zhou Wen pressed forward step by step as Berserker Immortal retreated.

Impossible! How is this possible! He has already seen through my Berserker technique in such a short period of time? This is definitely impossible! Berserker Immortal was extremely shocked.

It wasn’t that there weren’t any experts in the dimension who could fight him or even crack the Berserker technique, but they were all existences at the same or higher level than him. Furthermore, they often needed to study the Berserker technique for an extended period before cracking it.

A human-a Terror-grade human-had actually cracked his Berserker technique in a short battle. This was even more magical than myths.
