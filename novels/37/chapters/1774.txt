Chapter 1775 Evaluation of Four People L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was clearly a thrust without any unnecessary variations, but it gave off a wild and tragic aura.

It was as though under this strike, only one person would live. There was no room for negotiation. “This sword technique has already reached a sublime realm. Only after seeing this strike today do I know what a sword technique is,” Professor Gu praised.

In the blink of an eye, Zhong Ziya’s sword had already stabbed in front of the female Immortal. The female Immortal waved her sleeve and brushed it against the sword. The seemingly soft clothes produced a metallic clang when they collided with the sword.

Zhong Ziya’s sword was brushed to the side by the clothes as his body tilted.

Zhong Ziya, who had lost his balance, twisted his body in a strange state in midair. He forcefully transformed the thrust into a slash and slashed at the female immortal again.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The sound of metal clashing sounded incessantly. Zhong Ziya’s sword was brushed away by the sleeve again and again, and again, but he ingeniously made all kinds of variations in the air. From beginning to end, it was an attack without any signs of dodging or retreating

That wild and demonic sword technique was terrifying, but no matter how sharp and demonic his attacks were, they were gently flicked away by the female Immortal. He couldn’t even make her retreat half a step.

Even the spectators felt helpless despair.

What humans were most afraid of wasn’t that the enemy was powerful, but that they couldn’t see hope. Although the female Immortal didn’t take the initiative to attack, it was already enough to make them despair.

If it were an ordinary person, they would probably have been defeated without fighting. Their confidence would have been crushed.

Zhong Ziya was Zhong Ziya after all. Under such circumstances, not only did his fighting spirit and confidence not weaken, but it boosted his sacrificial will.

“As expected of Zhong Ziya. However, why does his sword technique feel odd?” Li Xuan praised.

Li Xuan was an extremely determined person, but if he were Zhong Ziya, he would probably feel a little discouraged in such a situation. A person as confident as Zhong Ziya was either a true genius or a true lunatic.

Of course, Li Xuan also had his confidence. He might grumble or feel vexed from being discouraged, but he definitely wouldn’t give up.

However, freaks like Zhong Ziya who didn’t seem to know what fear and despair were were rare.

There were many standards in this world that measured strength. There were also many standards that measured sword techniques. One’s sword could be fast enough, ruthless enough, or even slow enough.

Zhong Ziya’s sword technique seemed to possess the highest standards of all kinds of sword techniques. It was fast when it needed to be fast, and slow when it needed to be slow. It was ruthless when it needed to be ruthless, and it was very ingenious when it needed to be ingenious.

However, if one were to really comment on his sword art, there didn’t seem to be any suitable words.

“Senior Zhong Ziya’s sword technique is wild enough!” Feng Qiuyan voiced out everyone’s impression of Zhong Ziya’s sword technique.

“Yes, it’s wild. I was wondering why it’s odd. This person’s sword technique is just too wild. It looks very irregular. Many poses and actions are very irregular, but they are very effective. It’s like… like…” Li Xuan couldn’t think of a word to describe it. “It’s like having a dog paddling faster than a swimming champion,” Ming Xiu added.

“Yes, that’s the feeling.” Li Xuan nodded immediately. Ming Xiu’s words had hit the nail on the head.

Zhou Wen sighed and said, “Back then, Jiang Yan, Zhong Ziya, Hui Haifeng, and I studied under Teacher. Teacher once evaluated our talent.”

“What were his comments? Who has the highest talent? It’s definitely you, right?” Li Xuan and company were intrigued. They stopped watching the battle and turned to look at Zhou Wen.

Although Trajectory Seeking deliberately didn’t look at Zhou Wen, she pricked up her ears to listen. Clearly, she wanted to know what Zhou Wen was about to say.

Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “I’m not the one with the highest talent. That’s what Teacher said back then. He said that in terms of talent, Zhong Ziya is a naturally sentimental person. If he has decided on something, he can be extremely devoted. No matter what he learns, he will learn faster than anyone. Therefore, among the four of us, he has the highest talent.”

“What’s your ranking?” Trajectory Seeking couldn’t help but ask.

Li Xuan and company also wanted to know the answer to this question.

“I’m fourth,” Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile.

“No way. Your teacher’s acumen sucks. A person like you is only ranked fourth?”. Trajectory Seeking blurted out. She had already determined that Zhou Wen had extremely invincible talent. Otherwise, how could a human achieve such achievements?

“That’s your grandmaster. Don’t you know how to respect your seniors?” Li Xuan rendered Trajectory Seeking speechless with a single sentence.

Zhou Wen continued, “Zhong Ziya is sentimental. Jiang Yan’s evaluation is that he’s born a heartless person, while Hui Haifeng’s evaluation is that he’s the most secular person, and I only received a mediocre evaluation. Do you think I’m the one with the worst talent among the four?”

“It’s fine if it’s Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan, but Hui Haifeng’s secular evaluation shouldn’t be as good as yours, right?” Ming Xiu asked. “Most people are secular. To be able to become the cream of the crop among billions of people, how can someone described to be the most secular be inferior to the mediocre?” Zhou Wen sighed and said, “Teacher’s judgment of people is very accurate. When Hui Haifeng later became the Federation President, he indeed reached the peak of the secular world.”

As he spoke, Zhou Wen kept paying attention to the battle.

Zhong Ziya undoubtedly had the peak combat strength of a Calamity-grade creature. None of his moves seemed to be earth-shattering, nor did they have any dazzling lighting effects. However, it definitely wasn’t because he lacked strength. It was only because he converged all his strength into his body without leaking any.

If it were the past Zhong Ziya, he definitely wouldn’t have cared about such details; it was something that Jiang Yan cared about. Now that Zhong Ziya had done it, it was obvious that many things came to the same end. Perhaps their starting points were different, but in the end, they would all reach the same destination.

Clang!

Zhong Ziya’s sword was brushed away by the female Immortal’s sleeve again. However, this time, the female Immortal didn’t wait for Zhong Ziya to continue attacking. Instead, she suddenly extended her slender hand from her sleeve and grabbed the sword. With a slight shake, she forced Zhong Ziya to release his grip.

With a gentle shake, the female Immortal grabbed the hilt and stabbed at Zhong Ziya.

“She’s imitating Zhong Ziya’s sword technique?” Li Xuan exclaimed with an odd expression. The female Immortal attacked Zhong Ziya repeatedly. Every move she used was clearly once used by Zhong Ziya.

The crux of the matter wasn’t that the moves were the same. Even the wild aura was identical. If one only looked at the sword technique and not at the person, one would think that the person wielding the sword was Zhong Ziya.

She used Zhong Ziya’s sword technique to deal with him, yet she still sent him into a repeated retreat. His body was covered in bloody wounds.
