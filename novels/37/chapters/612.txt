Chapter 613 Eye of Odin

"Not interested." Zhou Wen shook his head.

Zhou Wen was considering how to kill Primordial Sword Immortal. He had no interest in an opponent at Sadie’s level. Even if she was a peerless genius, she was at most at the Epic stage.

The Epic stage was already too weak for Zhou Wen. He had condensed five Life Souls which was equivalent to someone advancing to the Epic stage five times. He really didn’t find the Epic stage impressive.

Even the six families wouldn’t randomly give a Mythical Companion Beast to such a young genius. This was because they had too little combat experience and were too young. Their minds weren’t staid enough and with mighty strength, they easily took risks. That way, they would die even faster.

An Epic expert without a Mythical Companion Beast was no challenge for Zhou Wen.

Sadie seemed to have expected that Zhou Wen would reject her, so she wasn’t angry. She continued, "I know you are very strong. If it were a life-and-death battle, I definitely wouldn’t be your match. However, if we compete in the acumen, I believe you aren’t my match."

"Since you are so confident, I’ll leave the Demonized General hunting mission to you." Zhou Wen retreated a little. A group of Demonized Soldiers had already discovered them and were charging over.

Although Sadie felt that Zhou Wen was looking down on her, she didn’t mind.

In the past, she would definitely have thought that Zhou Wen was too arrogant. However, after seeing Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal, she felt that he had the right to be arrogant.

A seventeen-year-old person who had already mastered a divine technique could be as arrogant as he wanted. It wasn’t excessive.

Sadie summoned an ice sword and charged at the Demonized Soldiers. The Demonized Soldiers were naturally not her match and were easily killed by her. They weren’t even considered a warm-up.

Seeing how Zhou Wen ignored her, Sadie tactfully didn’t say anything else. All she did was wait for an opportunity to make Zhou Wen think of her in a different light.

She was very confident in her Eye of Odin Life Soul. In her family’s evaluation, the Eye of Odin Life Soul was S+ rank. It was even stronger than the average S rank, a Life Soul akin to a bug in games.

Although Sadie’s Eye of Odin had only just condensed and was still a Primordial Body, its ability was already excellent.

Previously, it had been used to record videos, but in fact, it was just a trick of the Eye of Odin. What was truly impressive about the Eye of Odin was that it could observe an opponent in battle.

Now, Sadie’s limit was to slow things down by seven times. In battle, if she used this ability, all trajectories would appear seven times slower in her eyes.

This multiplier was calculated according to the standards of the Eye of Odin. It wasn’t slowing down the object by seven times.

In other words, someone’s seemingly fast attacks would become very slow in Sadie’s eyes. It made it easy for her to dodge those attacks or have enough time to think of a way to deal with them.

The Eye of Odin didn’t only strengthen her vision; in fact, the real target of the Eye of Odin was to strengthen her brain. If the brain’s thinking speed and reaction couldn’t keep up, it could easily cause a situation where one couldn’t react in time despite being able to detect it.

However, the Eye of Odin had strengthened her brain, allowing Sadie’s brain to think and react faster. This was the truly terrifying part.

A saber technique that looked as fast as lightning looked like slow motion in Sadie’s eyes when she slowed it down by seven times. At the same time, her mind raced with all sorts of countermeasures at lightning speed.

Now, Sadie’s only flaw was that because her eyesight and brainpower were too strong, her body couldn’t keep up with her brain’s reaction speed, causing her to have synchronization issues.

Under normal circumstances, a speed of four to five times was her limit. Her body’s speed could keep up with her eyesight and brainpower. Any higher, her body’s movement speed wouldn’t be able to keep up even if her brain issued an order.

In terms of combat abilities, Sadie knew that she was far from Zhou Wen’s match, but in terms of acumen, Sadie didn’t believe that she would lose to him.

As she charged forward, the ice sword in Sadie’s hand mercilessly harvested the lives of the Demonized Soldiers. Even if she encountered Demonized Generals, she could still kill them with one strike.

Her sword techniques didn’t have any unnecessary movements. She could always use the simplest method to kill her enemy.

Zhou Wen followed behind Sadie without making a move. Seeing that Sadie was about to rush into the range of the Tiger Cage Demonized General, he said, "Let’s end here. Stop walking forward."

"I heard that Tiger Cage Pass has a very powerful dimensional creature guarding it and ordinary people can’t charge in. Why don’t we have a bet? If I can charge into the city and kill the dimensional creature guarding the gates, it’ll be considered my victory. If I can’t charge in, or if I can’t kill the dimensional creature guarding the gates, count it as my loss. If I lose, I can tell you a secret about the cube ranking. If I’m lucky to win, I hope you can officially spar with me. Just the two of us. Let’s see who’s acumen is better," Sadie said.

"What secret?" Zhou Wen asked.

"It’s not a secret if I tell you, but I guarantee with my character that this secret is definitely worth it," Sadie said with certainty.

"Alright, I’ll bet with you. Are you sure you want to kill the strongest dimensional creature in Tiger Cage Pass?" Zhou Wen asked.

"That’s right. Let’s smack palms to make an oath. It’s a deal?" Sadie extended her hand.

Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate as he extended his palm and slapped Sadie’s palm.

Tiger Cage Demonized General was already a top Epic creature. No matter how talented Sadie was, killing Tiger Cage Demonized General was not bad.

However, what was truly terrifying in Tiger Cage Pass wasn’t the Tiger Cage Demonized General, but the Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet. Although that fellow was only at the Epic stage, his difficulty was already close to the Mythical stage. Zhou Wen didn’t think Sadie had the ability to kill the Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet.

After retracting her palm, Sadie’s lips curled up slightly. She wore a confident expression as she charged towards Tiger Cage Pass with her ice sword.

Zhou Wen watched from the side, prepared to help at any moment. If Sadie were to fail, he couldn’t watch her die here.

Just as Sadie stepped into the range of the Tiger Cage Demonized General’s shooting range, she saw an arrow shoot over with a strong spiral force. It was shockingly fast.

However, Sadie didn’t panic. When the arrow reached her, she took a slight step to the side and dodged the arrow. At the same time, she slashed the ice sword in her hand, landing the arrow. She continued rushing towards Tiger Cage Pass.

The storm-like arrows immediately shot over.

Zhou Wen watched as Sadie moved in a small area and brandished the ice sword in her hand. She easily passed through the arrow rain and continued charging at Tiger Cage Pass. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

This Sadie really has some ability. Zhou Wen realized that when Sadie passed through the rain of arrows, she used a very small movement to dodge a large number of arrows. Every time the ice sword struck out, it struck the most critical arrow.

The entire process was as exact as a computer’s calculated path. There was no waste of stamina through any unnecessary actions.

Even Zhou Wen himself couldn’t do better than Sadie.
