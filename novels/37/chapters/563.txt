Chapter 564 Folklore Exper

“I’ll figure out a solution for the sacrifice myself. Battalion Commander Lu, please take me in to have a look,” Zhou Wen said to Lu Yunxian.

Before Lu Yunxian could say a word, Lei Zhiguo shook his head and said, “I’m in charge of this place. I have to ensure the safety of everyone here. If you wish to enter, you have to wait two more days. Otherwise, I will not give you permission to enter.”

Lei Zhiguo was just too stubborn. Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian couldn’t convince him at all. Furthermore, he was the one in charge here, so Zhou Wen couldn’t barge his way in.

“Alright, I’ll wait another two days then.” Zhou Wen thought that although he had already killed the Torch Dragon youngling a few times on the way, killing it two more times to familiarize himself with the process wasn’t a bad thing. Therefore, he agreed to wait two days before following them into the temple.

Zhou Wen had recently farmed the Torch Dragon youngling, Medusa, and the Golden Battle God Halberd a few times, but the drop rate wasn’t as high as An Sheng had described. Most of the items dropped were stat crystals. Occasionally, an Essence Energy Skill Crystal would drop. Due to the limitations of his stats, Zhou Wen couldn’t use them nor take them out. All he could do was watch them disappear with each respawn.

Up to now, the Companion Egg that had dropped was only the Golden Battle God Halberd.

“Young Master Wen, the conditions here are rather poor. You can rest in my tent now.” Lu Yunxian took Zhou Wen into his tent.

Lu Yunxian didn’t have a tent for himself because space was limited. Typically, it was three people to a tent. Lu Yunxian’s tent originally had two people living in it, so it was perfect for Zhou Wen to stay there.

The two of them chatted for a while about what happened after they had parted previously. It was mainly Lu Yunxian speaking. Zhou Wen mostly listened silently.

Lu Yunxian had been stationed at the ruins all this while, having been responsible for cleaning up the dimensional creatures and protecting the experts.

Those comrades who had been with him previously had been transferred. Most of them were promoted and were deployed to other places.

As the two of them were chatting, a middle-aged man in his thirties walked in. Lu Yunxian introduced, “Young Master Wen, this is Professor Lei’s student, Qu Qingyun. He is also an expert in folklore. During his research on Torch Dragon and Qiongqi, he gave us quite a few valuable opinions.”

Lu Yunxian introduced Zhou Wen to Qu Qingyun. Qu Qingyun only said a few polite words before he went to bed. Clearly, he wasn’t interested in chatting with Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian didn’t wish to disturb him, so they went out of the tent for a stroll. They slept immediately after they returned.

The next day, when Zhou Wen and company woke up, they heard the commotion outside. They went out to take a look and saw that the logistics team had sent their supplies over. Everyone was busy moving things.

Qu Qingyun also walked out of the tent. When he saw someone in the logistics team, his eyes lit up. He went over with a smile. “Head Nurse Xu, why are you here alone? It’s so dangerous.”

“We got a batch of newly-made medicine which needs to be injected into the soldiers. I’m afraid that they will get the dosage wrong, so I came here myself,” Xu Wen said to Qu Qingyun. When she saw Lu Yunxian, she immediately saw Zhou Wen, who was standing beside Lu Yunxian. She immediately revealed a look of delight.

“Young Master Wen, when did you come to Zhuolu? Why didn’t I see you at the encampment?” Xu Wen quickly walked towards Zhou Wen and asked in pleasant surprise.

“I didn’t go to the encampment because I came straight to the ruins. I only wanted to take a look and leave, but I was delayed by some matters. I still need to stay for another two days,” Zhou Wen said.

“Young Master Wen, that’s not very nice of you. Since you’re here in Zhuolu, how can you not visit us?” Xu Wen and Lu Yunxian were the same. They had been through thick and thin with Zhou Wen, so their relationship with him wasn’t something ordinary comrades could compare with.

Qu Qingyun couldn’t help but frown when he saw how friendly Xu Wen was with Zhou Wen, but he didn’t say a word.

“Xu Wen, deliver the injections to the soldiers first. Young Master Wen will be here for two days. It won’t be too late to catch up later,” said Lu Yunxian with a smile.

“Alright, I’ll get back to work then. Young Master Wen, let’s have a good chat later.” Xu Wen returned to her work.

“Go ahead and busy yourself.” Zhou Wen’s mood improved significantly. To be able to meet such sincere friends in such a dark place made him feel better than getting a treasure.

Two days quickly passed. Zhou Wen had grinded the Torch Dragon youngling twice in this period of time. Although it was a harrowing experience each time, Zhou Wen was confident that he could kill it safely.

Professor Lei and company were already prepared. They brought Zhou Wen and entered the temple. Even Xu Wen followed Lu Yunxian in.

“The dangers in the temple are unimaginable. Remember not to act on your own. You must abide by the arrangements, or you will harm others and yourself.” Lei Zhiguo was a little worried about Zhou Wen as he repeatedly told him.

“I understand.” Zhou Wen agreed seriously.

Only then did Lei Zhiguo feel a little relieved. He was afraid that Zhou Wen was the kind of scion who would disregard everything just because of his temper. He had no idea that Zhou Wen’s understanding of the temple far exceeded his.

Under the lead of Lei Zhiguo and the other experts and professors, Zhou Wen and company finally headed for the passageway where the Aoyin stone statue was.

“Head Nurse Xu, the Aoyin stone statue is extremely evil. If you touch it, it will hurt people. Stay by my side. If there is any danger, I can protect you,” Qu Qingyun said as he walked beside Xu Wen.

Anyone could tell that Qu Qingyun was interested in Xu Wen.

Xu Wen shook her head slightly and said, “Mr. Qu, you must be joking. I’m a soldier. It’s my duty to protect you.”

Qu Qingyun smiled and said, “Outside, you are naturally the one protecting me. However, in such a place, many problems can’t be solved by brute force. I should be the one assuring you.”

He paused for a moment before saying, “Just like this Aoyin stone statue. Even if the Overseer personally came, I’m afraid he wouldn’t be able to do anything to it. A blood sacrifice is needed for safe passage...”

Qu Qingyun kept trying to show off, but he did not know that Xu Wen was not a woman who lacked a sense of security.

On the contrary, she was a qualified soldier. Qu Qingyun’s words were actually questioning her ability as a soldier. This naturally displeased Xu Wen. However, she didn’t say anything. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lu Yunxian, who was walking at the back, whispered to Zhou Wen, “Qu Qingyun was born into a rich family. His family background isn’t inferior to the An family’s, and he’s rather talented. Unfortunately, he’s too conceited. He’s not the type Xu Wen likes. I’m afraid he’s just wasting his efforts.”

Zhou Wen nodded slightly. Even someone with a low EQ like him could tell that Xu Wen didn’t have a good impression of him.

When everyone arrived in front of the Aoyin stone statue, Lei Zhiguo got Qu Qingyun to use a living creature as an offering to the Aoyin stone statue. Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t unfamiliar with this method. He was the one who had informed An Sheng of the method.

“It’s done. Everyone, please come this way.” Qu Qingyun bowed to the Aoyin stone statue before heading towards the Qiongqi temple.
