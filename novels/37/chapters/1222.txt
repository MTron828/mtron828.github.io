Chapter 1223: A Way to Take Advantage

Everyone was discussing the death of the golden person and the terror of the Golden Battle God. Zhou Wen thought more about it.

Tsukuyomi was forced to leave Earth not because she entered the dimension. She didn’t even leave the Solar System. Then, if she said that leaving Earth would be dangerous, where does the danger come from? Zhou Wen thought further.

There’s a Companion Egg in the Moon. Now that Venus has produced such a dimensional zone, could the danger they mentioned be referring to this? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss when he thought about it. There had to be something he didn’t know, but he couldn’t figure it out from speculation. It made him feel terrible.

I’ll just ignore it. No matter what, I can’t let the dimension succeed. I have to think of a way to obtain the item in the Venusian instance dungeon. Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang as everyone discussed the matter.

“Old Zhou, what do you think is going on with the dimensional zone on Venus? Why was it live-streamed by the Cube?” Li Xuan came to Zhou Wen and raised the matter.

“How would I know?” Zhou Wen also wanted to know why the Cube was doing this.

Unfortunately, the Cube was beyond the dimension’s control; humans knew nothing about it.

“I think the Cube loves to watch people fight to the death. It definitely doesn’t have any good intentions for coming out with a Venusian dimensional zone. Could it be that it wants to lure humans to explore Venus and watch the thrill of humans being killed?” Li Xuan said jokingly.

“That’s not impossible.” Just as Zhou Wen was speaking, he suddenly saw the live broadcast stir again.

A human figure appeared on the platform of the hemispherical building. On careful look, it was a human covered in armor.

“Eh, a human actually went?” Li Xuan looked and quickly recognized him. “That’s a fellow from the League of Guardians. How did he get there?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“It’s likely through the Cube,” Zhou Wen guessed.

As the two of them were talking, the Guardian scratched his finger and dripped a drop of blood on the platform. Then, the platform automatically opened and sucked the Guardian in.

After the Guardian entered, he didn’t encounter the Golden Battle God. The one who came out was still the Metal Guard.

When the Metal Guard shot the bullets, the Guardian released a terrifying frost power that froze the bullets in midair.

The Guardian was like a figure skater walking on ice as he shuttled through the Metal Guards. Wherever he passed, the Metal Guards would be frozen into ice sculptures.

When all the Metal Guards had turned into ice sculptures and the Guardian had retreated to a distance, the ice sculpture-like Metal Guards’ bodies suddenly shattered, turning into ice cubes.

Unlike the golden person, the Guardian picked up the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs on the ground. However, before he could finish picking them up, the Golden Battle God had already rushed out of the door.

The bullets shot out again at terrifying speeds. The Guardian also underwent Terror transformation, but under the effects of the Cube, humans could still see a transparent figure that didn’t completely vanish.

He quickly moved and dodged some bullets, but his speed was clearly not as fast as the Golden Battle God’s shooting. Just as he was about to fail at dodging a few bullets, the Guardian grabbed the bullets with both hands and actually squeezed them between his fingers.

The bullets exploded and turned into a terrifying ice mist.

However, this ice mist didn’t injure the Guardian. Instead, it strengthened the Guardian’s freezing power.

“The League of Guardians’ idea isn’t bad. They can use ice-type Guardians to fight those strange dimensional creatures.” Li Xuan watched for a while and knew that the outcome was decided.

However, Zhou Wen knew that things weren’t that simple. Although the Guardian’s ice-elemental powers did restrain the Golden Battle God Mark I, there were a total of six Golden Battle Gods. Their bullets were different.

This Guardian was purely ice-type. He could restrain one type, but he would probably be at a disadvantage if he encountered others.

The Guardian fought bitterly for more than an hour before finally killing the Golden Battle God. Unfortunately, his luck wasn’t good. Not to mention Companion Eggs, not a single dimensional crystal dropped.

Soon, the Golden Battle God Mark II rushed out again and shot crazily at the Guardian.

The Guardian didn’t dare let his guard down. He condensed an ice wall to block the bullets.

The bullets struck the ice wall and immediately exploded. However, this time, it wasn’t a bullet of frost. Terrifyingly high temperature flames quickly swept through the room.

Such terrifying flames were the nemesis of the Guardian. His ice-elemental abilities were greatly suppressed as the situation became more and more dangerous.

Unfortunately, the room was sealed—it was impossible for him to escape. In the end, he was burned to death in the room.

After that Guardian, no one entered the Venusian dimensional zone. The dragon, the black-winged angel, and skeleton monster that had previously visited Venus didn’t appear again, nor did Tsukuyomi appear again.

It was unknown if they were no longer interested or if they were waiting for an opportunity.

Soon, Zhou Wen received confirmed news that it was possible to reach the hemispherical building through the Cube.

However, no one dared to head over for the time being. Only Mythical creatures could survive on Venus. However, if they entered the Venusian dimensional zone, the two Terror-grade creatures before them were examples of the outcome.

It was easy to enter, but not so easy to come out again.

Zhou Wen looked at Venus on the screen and suddenly had an idea.

In the game, one had to wait 24 hours after dying in the Venusian instance dungeon. However, in reality, there didn’t seem to be such a restriction.

The interval between the golden person and the Guardian wasn’t 24 hours, but there were equally many Metal Guards.

If he only killed the Metal Guards and the Golden Battle God before leaving the Venusian instance dungeon, he could kill large numbers of Mythical creatures and Terror-grade creatures in a short span of time. The chances of Companion Eggs and good items dropping would greatly increase.

Although Zhou Wen had such thoughts, he wasn’t in a rush to take the risk. He still needed to confirm something.

It was an excruciating 24-hour wait before he could enter the Venusian instance dungeon again. Zhou Wen immediately entered and grinded the Metal Guards and the Golden Battle Gods inside.

However, this time, Zhou Wen wasn’t that lucky. He didn’t have a Golden Battle God Companion Egg drop and only obtained a skill crystal.

The skill crystal required 81 Constitution and 41 Fire stat. He also needed a Metal Essence Energy Art to absorb it. Zhou Wen had no choice but to give it up since he couldn’t meet the requirements.

When the six alarms sounded at the same time, Zhou Wen used spatial teleportation to leave the Venusian dungeon and arrive at the entrance’s platform.

It does work! Zhou Wen was overjoyed.

Following that, Zhou Wen made another attempt. He got the blood-colored avatar to drip a drop of blood on the platform and used the normal method to enter Venus.

After entering again, the alarm on the six doors stopped ringing. However, there were no more Metal Guards or Golden Battle Gods. The six doors remained open. The dungeon clearly hadn’t refreshed.
