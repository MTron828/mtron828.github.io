Chapter 579 Speedy Solar Lunar Shuttle

"What help do you need?" Zhou Wen asked.

"I’m going to a dimensional zone to do something and need help. There’s a Mythical creature guarding the area and it’s rather powerful. However, with your help, it shouldn’t be difficult to deal with it," Jiang Yan said.

"Alright." Zhou Wen agreed.

"Aren’t you going to ask which dimensional zone I’m going to?" Jiang Yan said with a smile.

"There’s no need. No matter which dimensional zone it is, I’ll accompany you." Zhou Wen shook his head.

"Alright, go back and prepare. See you here tomorrow morning," Jiang Yan said.

"I don’t have anything to prepare. I can go with you now." Zhou Wen brought everything he needed with him, so there was nothing to prepare.

"Let’s do it tomorrow. I don’t know if I’ll be able to come back in the future. I want to stay here for the night," Jiang Yan said as he looked at the dilapidated laboratory.

"Alright." Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else and returned to his dorm.

The next morning, Zhou Wen arrived at Old Dragon Cave again and saw a strange beast carriage in the laboratory.

The carriage looked ancient. Even the wheels were made of bronze. The carriage’s box wasn’t sealed with a baldachin over it. Pulling in front of it were two giant rabbits—one black, one white.

The rabbis were even bigger than an ordinary horse. They were almost the same size as an elephant. They sprawled on the ground, their bodies connected to the reins.

Jiang Yan was already in the carriage. When he saw Zhou Wen walk over, he waved at him. "Ah Wen, get in."

"Isn’t it too ostentatious to drive this carriage out?" Zhou Wen got into the carriage and asked uneasily.

If they were to drive this carriage out of Old Dragon Cave, it would definitely attract the attention of countless people, even onlookers.

"No." Jiang Yan was very certain. He held a whip and whipped the two giant rabbits.

The two giant rabbits immediately began moving. They moved quickly, and finally, Zhou Wen understood what it meant to start a hare.

The two giant rabbits charged forward like arrows with the carriage in tow.

However, there was a cave wall in front of them. Just as the two giant rabbits were about to slam into the mountain wall, Zhou Wen almost jumped off the carriage to prevent himself from dying in the collision.

However, Zhou Wen ultimately held back the urge to jump. He knew that Jiang Yan wasn’t such a rash person.

Indeed, the black and white giant rabbits slammed into the mountain wall, but the mountain wall didn’t seem to exist. They pulled the beast carriage and charged in.

Zhou Wen watched the black and white giant rabbits pulling the beast carriage forward quickly. Streams of light rushed ahead of him and to his side, as though they had entered a spacetime tunnel. He couldn’t see anything around him at all. There were distorted beams of light everywhere.

"What carriage is this?" Zhou Wen could tell that the beast carriage was extraordinary as he looked at Jiang Yan.

"Speedy Solar Lunar Shuttle." Jiang Yan continued when he saw that Zhou Wen was still in a daze, "The two rabbits pulling the carriage are Day, and the other is Night. When they are together, they can produce the ability to shuttle through space. Although they aren’t strong enough to reverse the flow of time, they can cross space and travel great distances in an instant. It’s best to travel with them."

Zhou Wen was alarmed when he heard that. The two rabbits were definitely at the Mythical stage. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to have such powers.

Although Zhou Wen had long felt that Jiang Yan wasn’t a simple person, he was still somewhat surprised that he had obtained such a Speedy Solar Lunar Shuttle.

After a while, the Speedy Solar Lunar Shuttle stopped.

Zhou Wen looked out of the carriage and realized that he wasn’t anywhere near Dragon Gate Grotto. He wasn’t even in Luoyang. There were towering mountain peaks that pierced through the clouds everywhere. There were no signs of humans. There were primitive forests everywhere, and the air was so clean and fresh that it felt sweet.

"We must walk on our own for the rest of the journey. Even Day and Night won’t be able to go up." Jiang Yan alighted the carriage and released the reins. The two rabbits flashed and escaped.

"Aren’t they your Companion Beasts?" Zhou Wen asked in surprise.

Jiang Yan shook his head and said, "No, I only temporarily invited them to pull the carriage. They aren’t Companion Beasts."

Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd again. To be able to invite wild dimensional creatures to pull carriages wasn’t something an ordinary person could do.

Jiang Yan pointed at the mountain that went straight into the clouds and said, "We have to climb to the top of this mountain. However, this mountain is extraordinary. When we climb it later, we can only advance and not retreat. Under no circumstances are you to retreat. Otherwise, you will be doomed."

"Why is that?" Zhou Wen asked, puzzled.

"This mountain is called Immortal Seeking. Legend has it that immortals live at the top of the mountain. Anyone who wishes to become an immortal can be reborn as an immortal if they can climb to the top of the mountain. Although this is only a legend, this mountain is indeed different. It has a terrifying taboo protecting it. Once someone steps into this mountain, they will definitely die if they take a step back. There’s no reason. That’s the rule of this mountain," Jiang Yan said.

I wonder if my Zero Taboo can restrain the taboo of Immortal Seeking Mountain. Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he didn’t plan on trying. All he did was look around the foot of the mountain, hoping to see if there was a tiny palm symbol. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Unfortunately, he didn’t see one. All he saw was a stone staircase spiraling up the mountain. It was like a heavenly staircase that pierced through the clouds, with no end in sight.

"There are many obstacles along the way, but with your willpower, I believe there won’t be any problems. Just remember that you can’t retreat," Jiang Yan said as he stepped onto the stone steps.

Zhou Wen followed him. Just as he stepped onto the stone steps, he immediately felt an invisible force tugging at his body. His body sank slightly as he nearly fell onto the stone steps.

With every step Zhou Wen took to climb the stairs, he felt like he was carrying a mountain. After taking a few steps, his clothes were almost drenched in sweat.

Jiang Yan was no different. He could see that his hair was drenched in sweat.

The power on the stone steps was very strange. It didn’t constantly grow stronger, nor would it constantly weaken. This power was just right to reach the limits of Zhou Wen’s body.

In other words, Zhou Wen had to use all his strength to take every step.

After taking a few steps, Zhou Wen felt that he had expended a lot of his strength, but the power on the stone steps seemed to possess intelligence. It would also weaken relatively, but the effort Zhou Wen needed to walk was maintained at maximum.

The first step was the limit. If it was someone with a weak will, their will would quickly collapse and they would have the intention to retreat.

However, Jiang Yan had said that they absolutely could not retreat. Retreat meant certain death.
