Chapter 1712 Treasure

“What’s that?” Liu Yun looked at the thing that came out of the cave with a look of surprise.

“How would I know what it is!” Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what it was either. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The thing that came out of the cave didn’t look like a living creature. From the exposed parts outside the cave, it looked like a metal container.

As only a portion of it was exposed, its entire body couldn’t be seen. It looked like a metal container with four sides. There were many strange and mysterious patterns engraved on it, making it look ancient.

The metal container was still squeezing out because it was slightly bigger than the cave. With every movement, the metal outer wall emitted an ear-piercing screech as it rubbed against the mountain wall. It was the sound Zhou Wen and Liu Yun had heard previously.

Clang!

Just as Zhou Wen and Liu Yun were hiding in the distance and watching, a metal container dropped out of the cave and landed on the ground. Indeed, it was a metal container that was about the height of a person. It was wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. The bottom was squarish, and it was impossible to tell what it was.

The two of them exchanged looks and neither of them dared to show themselves. They hid in the distance and watched for a while. The thing remained motionless as though it was dead.

Furthermore, after the metal container fell out, nothing else came out of the cave.

“Junior Brother, you are the knowledgeable one. Why don’t you take a look at it and see what it is?” Liu Yun wanted to know what it was, but he didn’t dare take a gander for himself. He encouraged Zhou Wen.

“Such matters should be left to senior brothers.” Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to take the risk. His feet didn’t move at all as though he had rooted himself to the ground.

The two of them looked at each other. No one dared to really go over.

Time ticked by. The two of them waited for more than half an hour, but there was no movement from the metal artifact.

Liu Yun’s curiosity was greater than Zhou Wen’s. Finally, he couldn’t help but summon a Companion Beast that resembled a cat or a ferret. He controlled the Companion Beast and made it carefully approach the metal artifact.

The two of them stared at the Companion Beast and metal container until the Companion Beast crawled to its side. However, the thing remained motionless.

“Crawl in and see what’s inside.” Zhou Wen observed for a while. The middle of the metal container was empty. It was a square basin, but he couldn’t see what was inside. He had used several vision techniques, but all he saw was chaotic noise. He couldn’t see what was inside.

Liu Yun naturally wouldn’t take the risk with his main Companion Beasts. The Companion Beast he had summoned was only an ordinary Epic Companion Beast. Even if it died, he wouldn’t feel the pinch. He immediately stopped arguing with Zhou Wen and ordered the Companion Beast to jump up.

Seeing the Companion Beast standing on the metal container while nothing happened, Liu Yun ordered it to drill in again.

The moment the Companion Beast entered, the metal container immediately reacted. It trembled as though it had been electrocuted. A strange light was swirling inside.

After a moment, before the two of them could figure out anything, the metal container stopped trembling and returned to its original motionless state.

“Is it dead?” Zhou Wen couldn’t see the situation inside the metal container, so he could only ask Liu Yun.

Liu Yun wore an odd expression and didn’t answer Zhou Wen’s question. He stared intently at the metal container. Soon, Liu Yun’s Companion Beast crawled out of the metal container. However, the Companion Beast that crawled out was clearly bigger. Its originally pale yellow fur was even more resplendent with golden light, like a golden-furred beast.

Zhou Wen immediately widened his eyes when he saw it. With his present abilities, even if he didn’t know what kind of Companion Beast it was, he could roughly tell its level.

The Companion Beast that Liu Yun had summoned was clearly at the Epic stage, but after crawling out, it had reached the Mythical stage.

The two of them immediately realized that the metal container seemed to be an amazing treasure.

“Is your Companion Beast an evolvable type?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.

If it was an evolvable Companion Beast, it wouldn’t be difficult for it to advance from the Epic stage to the Mythical stage due to the help of some powerful treasure.

However, if a non-evolving Companion Beast could advance to the Mythical stage inside the metal container, that would be amazing.

“Yes, it’s an evolvable Companion Beast. From the looks of it, there’s quite a lot of energy inside. It actually advanced to the Mythical stage so quickly,” said Liu Yun.

As Liu Yun spoke, he suddenly instant transmitted to the metal container and reached out to grab it.

Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen appeared on the other side of the metal container and grabbed it with one hand. He knew Liu Yun too well. From Liu Yun’s words, he knew that he was definitely lying. The Companion Beast he had summoned was most likely an unevolvable Epic.

Liu Yun’s actions proved this point. Zhou Wen grabbed the edge of the metal container and tried his best to snatch it.

To be able to advance an ordinary Companion Beast to the Mythical stage, this thing was practically a divine artifact.

If ordinary Companion Beasts could advance to the Mythical stage after staying inside for a moment, what changes would a true high-level Companion Beast undergo inside? Just the thought of it was thrilling.

Liu Yun was only at the Terror grade and his strength was far inferior to Zhou Wen’s. Although the two of them grabbed the edge of the metal container, Zhou Wen was strong enough to pull it towards him. Just as Zhou Wen thought he was about to succeed, Liu Yun twisted the palm holding the metal container, making it suddenly vanish. Zhou Wen felt air in his grasp.

“Haha, Junior Brother, I’m not as good at fighting as you are, but you’re still wanting when it comes to stealing. Besides, I gave you a chance just now. You didn’t do it yourself. Now that I have it, you can’t take it from me.” Liu Yun took two steps back and looked at Zhou Wen with a smug look. Clearly, he had transferred the metal container somewhere.

Zhou Wen felt a little regretful. If he had known, he would have used Universe Inversion first to get the metal container in his position.

But it was already too late. Even if Zhou Wen wanted to use the Universe Inversion, it was useless if he couldn’t find the metal container.

“Congratulations on obtaining the treasure, Eldest Senior Brother. It’s best if you take a closer look. That thing might not be able to be used by you.” However, Zhou Wen wasn’t the kind of person who believed that all the treasures in the world should belong to him. Since Liu Yun had snatched the treasure from him due to his carelessness, he didn’t plan on vying for it.

“Haha, I know the feeling of sour grapes. Don’t worry, I’ll examine it carefully, but don’t even think about touching it.” Liu Yun instant transmitted far away before waving his hand again, producing the metal container out of thin air.

As he guarded against Zhou Wen, he carefully observed the metal artifact. Soon, he summoned an Epic Companion Beast and threw it in.

A magical scene happened again. The metal artifact trembled as the Epic Companion Beast that Liu Yun had thrown in advanced to the Mythical stage.

“Haha, I’m finally rich.” Liu Yun laughed out loud, almost jumping with joy.
