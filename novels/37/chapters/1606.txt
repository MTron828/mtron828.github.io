Chapter 1607 Blocking the Entrance

The lightning sea was extremely terrifying, but Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss.

Being inside the lightning, Zhou Wen could sense that the power of the Void Salamander’s lightning was weakening at a terrifying speed. This weakening speed was much faster than Zhou Wen imagined. At this speed, it wouldn’t be long before the Void Salamander fell to the Hell level or even the Human Realm. It might even fall to the Terror grade. Zhou Wen saw the Void Salamander’s body distort abnormally as though invisible steel needles had stabbed into its body, causing it to distort in pain.

Even so, the Void Salamander charged at Zhou Wen with all its might, hoping to chomp him to death. It was obvious how much it hated him.

The rules of Earth that suppress creatures alien to Earth are too powerful! Zhou Wen, who should have been happy, wasn’t that happy.

If this had happened previously, Zhou Wen would be very happy. However, he still wanted to use the Void Salamander to camp at the entrance to the Holy Land. If the Void Salamander were to continue weakening, how was it to camp outside?

Any Saint with a Holy Artifact could kill the Void Salamander.

Such a Void Salamander definitely didn’t have the capability to hold a siege of the Holy Land’s entrance. Zhou Wen immediately stopped and used spatial teleportation to return to the cosmos.

The Void Salamander also rushed out of Earth and continued pursuing Zhou Wen. After it left Earth, its body rapidly recovered as its lightning powers increased.

“Eh? Why is it gone?”

“What’s going on? I haven’t had my fill of watching. And that’s it?”

“I knew it. No matter how impressive Egg Sovereign is, he’s still far inferior to the Holy Land. So it’s just a feint.”

“It’s already impressive that he dares fire a shot at the Holy Land.”

“Bring Old K and Jiuyang back immediately. No matter what, we have to track Zhou Wen. I want his life.” Holy God’s eyes were cold.

Ever since the establishment of the Holy Land, no one had dared to do such a thing at the Holy Land’s entrance. Zhou Wen’s actions were equivalent to trampling all over the Holy Land’s reputation. Although it didn’t affect the Holy Land itself, its lofty status in the hearts of humans had been trampled. “Lord Holy God, even if I bring Jiuyang and Old K back, it won’t be easy to track Zhou Wen again.” Xiao thought to himself, That punk really has a death wish. He actually came to the Holy Land to cause trouble. Thankfully, he knew better and ran fast.

Holy God naturally knew that it would probably be very difficult to capture Zhou Wen. They succeeded when he left the dimensional zone. It was almost impossible to capture him now. What puzzled Holy God even more was that he had already tried a few times to predict Zhou Wen’s whereabouts, but he had failed to predict anything. It was as though everything about Zhou Wen had nothing to do with this world. This was almost impossible. Any creature that lived in the universe would definitely have a connection with this universe. He would definitely be able to discover something through this connection if it existed.

In this aspect, Holy God was an expert. However, he couldn’t predict anything related to Zhou Wen. He couldn’t even sense Zhou Wen’s connection to the world.

Typically, when such a situation happened, it meant that the other party’s strength was far above Holy God’s. He could forcefully conceal his connection with the world, preventing Holy God from prying into his secrets.

However, those capable of doing so were all bigwigs at the Apocalypse grade. There was no such existence on Earth at present.

Zhou Wen clearly couldn’t be an Apocalypse-grade bigwig. Then, the most likely possibility was that there was something on him that blocked his connection with this world.

After some thought, the anger in Holy God’s heart gradually calmed down. He knew that Xiao was right. It was useless for them to chase after Zhou Wen now. They should first set up a trap. When it was time to pull in the net, Zhou Wen would have nowhere to run. All he could do was bow his head and die.

Boom!

As Holy God was thinking, he suddenly heard a loud boom followed by continuous thunderclaps. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Holy God and Xiao were stunned as they instantly realized what had happened. Through the spirit mirror, they looked at the entrance of the Holy Land and saw that there was another sea of lightning at the entrance. Zhou Wen, who was protected by the Chaos Egg, was floating above the teleportation nexus.

It was as though the same old scene was being replayed. The Void Salamander used void lightning to constantly bombard the area near the teleportation nexus.

This b*stard! Xiao was alarmed. He never expected Zhou Wen to dare return.

Xiao felt like cursing. It wasn’t easy for him to dispel Holy God’s determination to do an all-out pursuit of Zhou Wen, but to his surprise, Zhou Wen had repeated his actions.

It wasn’t just Xiao. Many people watching the livestream also thought that it was about to end. Even the livestream was about to be switched to something else. To their surprise, something unexpected happened again.

“Heavens, Egg Sovereign has returned with that terrifying Companion Beast!”

“What’s he up to?” “Don’t tell me he really wants to fight the Holy Land to the death?”

“It’s definitely not a fight to the death. If so, he wouldn’t have retreated just now.”

“What do you know? This is the strategy of great leaders in ancient times. When the enemy advances, we retreat. When the enemy retreats, we advance. It’s called guerrilla warfare.”

Everyone became excited again. Everyone had mixed feelings about the Holy Land. In the beginning, humans had almost treated the Holy Land as a true holy land in their hearts.

However, in this era, people no longer had the same faith in the Holy Land. They gradually realized that the Holy Land had always enslaved humans and controlled the Federation.

However, as the Holy Land had reigned over humans for too long, even if there was some animosity in their hearts, very few people dared to challenge the Holy Land’s authority.

Zhou Wen’s current actions were equivalent to doing something countless humans wanted but didn’t dare do. The agreement was far more important than the outcome.

Zhou Wen circled the cosmos with the Void Salamander. After it recovered, he lured it back to Earth.

The Void Salamander’s void lightning constantly struck the teleportation nexus, leaving charred marks everywhere. Although it wasn’t damaged, tiny cracks had already appeared. Zhou Wen didn’t insist on staying. Moments later, he returned to the cosmos and lured the restrained Void Salamander back.

“Zhou Wen!” Holy God’s eyes were extremely cold as though they were about to emit a cold aura.

Boom!

In the next second, Zhou Wen and the Void Salamander appeared again. The lightning enveloped the Holy Land’s entrance again.

Crack!

The extremely hard and almost invulnerable teleportation nexus cracked under the bombardment of the void lightning.

“Bring Old K and Jiuyang back immediately.” Holy God’s voice seemed to be squeezed out from between his gritted teeth.
