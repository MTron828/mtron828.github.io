Chapter 1451: Metal Seed

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen had previously considered this problem. It wasn’t just Zhou Wen. After Venus shattered, many people were thinking about the possibility of Companion Beasts existing inside the other planets or even the sun, as well as worrying what would happen if they were released.

Ignoring everything else, if there was no sun, humans below the Mythical stage would probably find it difficult to survive on Earth.

Furthermore, if the sun exploded, the energy produced would have an immeasurable influence on Earth.

“So what if you obtain all the Companion Beasts after they appear?” The Thearch’s message came again.

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen didn’t know what The Thearch was up to.

“Help me do a few things and I’ll teach you how to prevent such a situation from happening,” The Thearch said.

“What do you want?” Zhou Wen wanted to know what The Thearch was up to.

“I’ve already told you the first matter. I want that stone saber. There are a few other things I need your help with. Of course, with your unyielding character, I’m afraid you won’t be willing to do it now. It’s fine. I can wait. When the planets shatter, you will naturally beg to cooperate with me.” The Thearch knew Zhou Wen’s character quite well, so she wasn’t anxious.

“I do wish to cooperate with you. Why don’t you tell me what you need?” Zhou Wen still wanted to ask.

The Thearch ignored him. There were no more messages from her.

Let’s take it one step at a time.?Zhou Wen also knew that the possibility The Thearch mentioned existed, but he could do nothing about it.

Zhou Wen continued studying how to eliminate the strange power on him. Otherwise, it would be too troublesome. Affected by this power, he had no way of concealing himself. It was impossible for him to use other identities.

From the looks of it, it’s impossible to remove it. Is there any way to hide the power of this fragrance??Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, the mysterious phone vibrated.

Could it be that the Golden Wyrm’s Birth has completed??Zhou Wen picked up his phone and realized that it wasn’t the Golden Wyrm, but a fruit on the Dead Man Tree that had ripened.

The fruit was born after the metal flower was absorbed. It was the first time the Dead Man Tree had absorbed a creature that wasn’t human. Therefore, Zhou Wen had always been looking forward to seeing what kind of Companion Beast the metal flower would give birth to.

Seeing that the metal flower Companion Egg had finally ripened, Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at its information.

Metal Seed: Mortal (Evolvable)

Strength: 11

Speed: 11

Constitution: 11

Essence Energy: 11

Talent Skill: Metal Evolution

Companion Form: Ring

A ring-type Companion Beast is rather rare, but what does this Metal Evolution mean??Zhou Wen studied the annotation and only knew that it was an ability for metal lifeforms to evolve. He didn’t know what it meant.

He hatched it and summoned Metal Seed. Then, a purple metal seed appeared in Zhou Wen’s hand. The seed was only the size of a quail egg and was covered in blood-colored patterns. It looked beautiful and mysterious.

However, it appeared to be a dead object. It couldn’t move, nor did it have any offensive or defensive abilities. Zhou Wen studied it for a long time but failed to discover its use.

After making Metal Seed take its ring form, Zhou Wen put the purple metal ring on his left pinky, but he didn’t feel any special effects.

From the looks of it, I’ll only know what it’s used for when it advances to a higher level.?Zhou Wen attempted to use Essence Crystals to accelerate the ripening of Metal Seed, but he realized that it was useless. Metal Seed didn’t absorb Essence Energy.

…

While Zhou Wen was studying Metal Seed, Xiao was half-kneeling in front of Holy God in the Holy Land.

“Lord Holy God, I’ve successfully advanced to the Calamity grade. Please permit me to head to Luoyang and eliminate An Tianzuo.” Xiao’s tone was calm, but the raging hatred in his heart was unconcealed.

“An Tianzuo naturally has to be eliminated. However, before that, there’s something I need you to do. After doing this, it won’t be too late to eliminate him,” said Holy God.

“Lord Holy God, what are your orders?” Xiao lowered his head.

Holy God glanced at him. “It was a testament of your talent to return from the Lake Frustration alive, but you ultimately failed to reach the Paramita.”

“I was reborn thanks to you, Lord Holy God. I’ll do whatever you say,” Xiao said.

He had ultimately failed to reach Paramita and needed Holy God to pull the dying him out of Lake Frustration.

However, Holy God said, “You lived because of your own abilities. If you couldn’t persist until you had a Mythical body, it would have been difficult for me to pull you back from Lake Frustration even with my supreme means.”

“That may be true, but if it wasn’t for you, Lord Holy God, I would have long sunk to the bottom of the lake. Furthermore, you extended me such great help. To be able to return to the Calamity grade in such a short period of time… No… I should say that I’ve now truly advanced to the Calamity grade…” Xiao had now advanced to the Calamity grade by himself without using any Guardians.

“You have just advanced to the Calamity grade, and with existences like Zhou Wen and An Tianzuo in Luoyang, you might not necessarily succeed. The place I want you to go this time isn’t only for you to complete a mission, but to also boost your strength and give you a chance to improve further. When the time comes, no one will be able to stop you in Luoyang,” Holy God said indifferently. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Lord, where are you sending me?” Xiao couldn’t help but ask.

“I want you to go down to Lake Frustration again and reach Paramita,” said Holy God.

“But my previous attempt has already proven that I can’t reach Paramita,” Xiao said in a dilemma.

“It was impossible back then, but it doesn’t mean it can’t be done now. You previously used the power of Lake Frustration to advance to a Mythical body. Your body already has the power of Lake Frustration. Its effects on you will be minimized. With your current Calamity-grade power, you will definitely be able to reach Paramita if nothing goes wrong.”

“What happens after I reach Paramita?” Xiao asked.

“Didn’t I tell you before that I saw a person whose survivability was nil swim across Lake Frustration and reach Paramita? After you reach Paramita, find him. No matter what method you use, you have to bring him back.” When Holy God mentioned the person, his eyes looked somewhat strange.

Xiao was slightly surprised. “If that person can really swim to Paramita by himself, he must be an extremely terrifying existence. Can my strength bring him back?”

“Humans are only humans after all. No matter how strong they are, they can’t withstand the power of time. At his age, even if he’s still alive, he’s probably on the brink of death. He’s definitely not your match. Even if he’s dead, bring his corpse back,” said Holy God.

“What kind of person is he?” Xiao couldn’t help but ask curiously.
