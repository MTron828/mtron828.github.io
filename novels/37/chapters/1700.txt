Chapter 1701 Disciples Share the Burden When Matters Crop Up

“Karoman, why are you here instead of enjoying yourself at the Cape family residence?” Li Xuan stood in front of the city gates, looking frivolous.

“I want someone.” As he stood there casually, he gave off the feeling of being high and mighty, like a proud son of heaven.

“If you want someone, find a human peddler. We are a prim and proper place which doesn’t sell people,” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.

Karoman frowned slightly, but he didn’t flare up. He wasn’t worried about Li Xuan and Zhou Wen, but this was nominally the An family’s territory. Even the Cape family was somewhat afraid of Luoyang’s An family.

“Lend me Guide Ancient City’s Shiraishi Satomi for a month. Tell me how much you need in exchange,” said Karoman.

“How pitiful. You’re already aging at such a young age. Your ears no longer work. Let me repeat myself. If you want to buy someone, find a human peddler. This place doesn’t sell people,” Li Xuan said with a sneer.

Li Xuan knew about Shiraishi Satomi and Ise Island. When he heard Karoman mention Shiraishi Satomi, he guessed what he was up to. He naturally couldn’t hand Shiraishi Satomi over to him.

“If it wasn’t for An Tianzuo, you wouldn’t have the right to negotiate with me. I hope you won’t make a mistake.” Karoman frowned. If the negotiation really failed, even if he had to fall out with An Tianzuo, he definitely had to take Shiraishi Satomi away today.

To others, Amaterasu was only a powerful Companion Beast, but it wasn’t that simple for Karoman.

His Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, Terror transformation, and Calamity Zone were perfectly compatible with the power of the Sun God Holy Temple. Otherwise, the Sun God Holy Temple wouldn’t have chosen the Cape family as their representative. After all, the Cape family was the faction of the Holy Emperor Temple in the human world.

As for Amaterasu, he was the Sun God of a pantheon. He was extremely compatible with Karoman and was one of the Companion Beasts he had to vie for.

Upon hearing that, Li Xuan laughed. “You really don’t need to consider anyone. Our Guide Ancient City doesn’t need to rely on anyone.”

“In that case, get Zhou Wen out. I want to see how powerful the legendary Deceit King is.” A cold glint flashed in Karoman’s eyes as he planned on ending the battle quickly and taking Shiraishi Satomi away before An Tianzuo received the news and rushed over.

“Alright, hold on a moment.” Li Xuan knew how powerful Karoman was. Now that his level was inferior to his, he didn’t plan on fighting him head-on. He returned to the city to find Zhou Wen.

“I’ll only wait three minutes,” said Karoman coldly.

Li Xuan couldn’t be bothered to waste his breath on him. After entering the city, he headed straight for Zhou Wen’s yard and explained the situation to him.

Karoman is the representative of the Sun race, and he also has sun-type strength. Amaterasu is the Sun God. It’s not difficult to understand why he’s so anxious. From the looks of it, it’s really possible that Shiraishi Satomi is really related to Ise Shrine. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and followed Li Xuan out of the city.

“Zhou Wen, do you dare make a bet with me? Let’s fight. If I lose, this Calamity-grade Companion Beast will be yours. If you lose, lend me Shiraishi Satomi for a month,” said Karoman as he held a fist-sized Companion Egg that emitted a purple glow.

“No deal.” Zhou Wen rejected it without any hesitation.

Victory was a certainty, but he wouldn’t use someone of his as a stake. This was his bottom line. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Don’t force me to do something I’m unwilling to do.” Karoman’s expression turned cold as he stared at Zhou Wen and enunciated each word clearly. At the same time, the golden divine light on his body rose like the sun’s holy brilliance.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he suddenly heard someone say languidly, “Coach, is this person here to cause trouble?”

“Little Xiuxiu, you’re back?” Li Xuan was immediately overjoyed when he saw the young man walking over from the main road. Finally, someone could share his workload.

“Brother Xuan, what’s going on?” Ming Xiu sized up Karoman and asked.

“This fellow is the Cape family’s Karoman, second on the Cube’s rankings. He’s here to cause trouble,” Li Xuan said casually.

Karoman wasn’t in the mood to listen to their nonsense. He said to Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, do you want to fight me or do you want me to storm Guide Ancient City and take her away? You can choose between the two paths. I’ll give you one final minute to consider.”

“Coach, rest for a while. A disciple shall share the burden when matters crop up. Leave this riff-raff to me.” Ming Xiu’s expression made it seem like he was trying to chase away a street punk instead of a world-renowned super powerhouse.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded. He also wanted to see how much improvement Ming Xiu, who had returned from the dimension, had undergone. With him watching from the side, even if Ming Xiu wasn’t a match for Karoman, nothing serious would happen.

“Little Xiuxiu, are you up to it? Although this fellow isn’t much of a character, he’s still strong,” Li Xuan whispered to Ming Xiu.

“Don’t worry.” Ming Xiu gave Li Xuan a reassuring look before walking in front of Karoman. “Do you want to leave by yourself or do you want me to send you off?”

“You have a death wish!” Karoman was slightly furious.

Ignoring the fact that Ming Xiu kept calling Zhou Wen Coach, making it obvious that he was clearly Zhou Wen’s disciple, he didn’t even take Zhou Wen to heart, what’s more Ming Xiu. He was already filled with killing intent.

It was impossible for him to take Shiraishi Satomi away peacefully today. Karoman had already decided to serve a warning. Even if he didn’t kill Ming Xiu, he would cripple him.

Without any further nonsense, Karoman produced Sun God Light with a thought. Thousands of light streams shot out in every direction. It was really as if the Sun God was enraged.

Ming Xiu didn’t panic. He clenched his right hand and a sword appeared in his hand before he slowly stabbed out.

When Li Xuan and the guards standing on the city wall saw this scene, they couldn’t help but feel their hearts in their throats. Ming Xiu’s strike looked slow and weak. It wasn’t fast, ruthless, or accurate at all. It didn’t have any shocking aura either. It was soft and seemed to lack force.

Compared to Karoman’s dazzling image, it made one suspect that Ming Xiu would be instantly reduced to dust.

However, Zhou Wen was slightly surprised when he saw Ming Xiu’s strike.

He knew Ming Xiu’s Tomorrow Sword Art very well. Now that he had activated the Teacher Domain to take a look, he immediately realized that the current Tomorrow Sword Art was indeed much stronger than before. In terms of realm, it wasn’t inferior to the present Honn Shinsakura. Even Zhou Wen couldn’t completely understand its profundity. It was only with the help of the Teacher Domain that he could identify its true profundity.

Of course, their Sword Dao was different, and there was little comparison.

When the dazzling Karoman saw this strike, his expression changed slightly. He couldn’t tell the trajectory of the strike. It was as though the strike had no origin or destination, as though it had been born out of thin air.

At his realm, he could almost predict the trajectories of every sword art. Such a situation surprised him. His contempt immediately vanished. He knew that he had encountered a terrifying opponent.
