Chapter 1487 Liu Yun’s Concerns

Liu Yun circled Zhou Wen a few times before standing in front of him. He stared at his face carefully and gradually frowned.

“Strange. It’s clearly a stone statue. Why does it have a sense of familiarity while inducing some hate?” Liu Yun looked at the stone beast and muttered to himself.

This punk’s spiritual perception is so sharp! Zhou Wen was given a fright, afraid that Liu Yun would notice.

He had scammed Liu Yun many times. If Liu Yun knew that he couldn’t move after becoming a stone statue, who knew how he would take revenge on him.

“The more I look at it, the more I find it irritating.” Liu Yun’s eyes darted around as he walked in front of him and reached out to pull his pants.

No… No way… Zhou Wen was alarmed as he had the urge to turn around and escape. He guessed what Liu Yun was up to.

However, he couldn’t escape at all. He couldn’t even close his eyes.

A clear fountain drenched the stone beast’s front legs, giving Zhou Wen the urge to kick Liu Yun to death.

What was even more terrifying was that Liu Yun was constantly raising the angle of the fountain launcher, causing the liquid to spray even higher.

“How is it? Are you ashamed? You’ve never seen such a majestic treasure, right? An existence as talented as me is one in a billion among humans. It’s your good fortune to be able to see my treasure. If you have the chance to be reincarnated in your next life, remember to grow like me. Don’t be as irritating as you are now. However, you don’t have to think about having such a huge asset like me. To have a third of it is something you will enjoy for the rest of your life…” Liu Yun boasted as he sprayed.

Why don’t the heavens smite this fellow to death! Zhou Wen was extremely disgusted. It was fine if his body was defiled, but he had to endure Liu Yun’s psychological attacks.

Zhou Wen used all his strength to escape the petrification’s restraints, but it was useless. The Essence Energy and strength in his body didn’t obey his orders as though they had also been petrified.

“Watch my Sea-Emerging Twin Dragons… Fountain to the Nine Heavens…” Liu Yun sprayed higher and higher until he was about to spray Zhou Wen’s shoulder.

Die… Die… Die… Zhou Wen screamed inwardly as he struggled with all his might, but it was useless.

Bang!

Zhou Wen suddenly felt his body turn heavy. The ethereal feeling vanished as his body was dispelled of its petrified state.

After a plume of white smoke appeared, Zhou Wen returned to his original appearance from his petrified state.

This sudden development left Zhou Wen and Liu Yun stunned.

“Ah!” Two screams nearly overlapped as Zhou Wen quickly retreated. Liu Yun zipped up as he retreated, but in his panic, his flesh was caught in the zipper. “Holy sh*t… Holy sh*t…” Liu Yun’s face turned livid from the pain as he held his crouch and jumped.

Zhou Wen quickly took off his shirt and threw it far away. One of his sleeves was wet.

“Are you f*cking sick? You turned into a stone statue to peep at me pee!?” Liu Yun composed himself and pointed at Zhou Wen as he stomped his feet.

“Pui! You’re the f*cking sick one. You’re a human, not a beast. Instead of using the bathroom, you came all the way here to Laojun Platform to relieve yourself? Aren’t you afraid Lord Laojun will smite you?” Zhou Wen immediately retorted.

“It’s my business where I want to relieve myself. Why? Are you feeling inferior because of my asset? It’s fine. It’s only right for the senior brother’s to be bigger than the junior brother’s… Besides, you are the youngest junior brother…” Liu Yun deliberately emphasized the word ‘youngest.’

“Asset? You mean that bean sprout?” Zhou Wen curled his lips.

“F*ck you. You’re just jealous. Can that bean sprout of yours…”

The two of them cursed each other for a while until they were out of cuss words. Both their mouths were dry.

Zhou Wen leaned against the wall and panted while Liu Yun took out a pill to feed the treasure calabash.

“I never expected you to be Jing Daoxian’s grandson. It’s no wonder you were so certain that Jing Daoxian wouldn’t harm you,” Zhou Wen said with an odd expression after taking a deep breath.

After Liu Yun finished feeding the treasure calabash, his expression turned odd when he heard Zhou Wen.

Looking at the door and seeing that it was tightly shut, Liu Yun lowered his voice and said, “Jing Daoxian is very certain that I’m his grandson. He treats me pretty well, but Teacher said that I’m not Jing Daoxian’s grandson.”

Zhou Wen was taken aback when he heard that. “How can a person like Jing Daoxian not know who his family is? But Teacher isn’t someone who speaks nonsense…”

“That’s why I don’t know who to believe. Logically speaking, it’s impossible for the old man… I mean Jing Daoxian to make a mistake, but Teacher’s words have never been wrong.” Liu Yun was also depressed.

“Didn’t you ask your parents?” Zhou Wen asked.

“My parents are long dead. How am I to ask? Should I slit my throat and find them?” Liu Yun rolled his eyes at Zhou Wen.

“Then how can Jing Daoxian be sure that you are his grandson?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“How would I know? After we met him in the Mausoleum of Qin Shihuang, he made the baffling statement that I was his grandson, but he didn’t tell me the reason. I originally thought that he was deliberately taking advantage of me, but later, he gave me quite a number of benefits. His actions made it seem like it was true,” Liu Yun said gloomily.

With that said, Liu Yun suddenly came to Zhou Wen’s side and grabbed his collar. He stared at him and almost stuck to his face. He said with a heavy expression, “Let me ask you a question. You have to answer me honestly.”

“Just shoot. Why are you grabbing me?” Zhou Wen asked.

Liu Yun didn’t let go. He continued grabbing him and asked, “Why did you suddenly come here and become a stone beast? Did Teacher ask you to come?”

“No, I didn’t plan on transforming into a stone beast. Here’s what happened.” Zhou Wen recounted what had happened.

After Liu Yun heard that, his expression softened a little. However, he still asked worriedly, “Was it really not Teacher who asked you to come?”

“No,” Zhou Wen answered with certainty. Then, he looked at Liu Yun and asked, “Are you suspecting that Teacher is up to something?”

Liu Yun released Zhou Wen’s collar and said with an odd expression, “It’s not that I’m suspicious, but I find it terrifying. Don’t you think that there’s something wrong with Teacher?”

“Of course something’s amiss. He has already become the Dragon King of the dimension,” Zhou Wen said.

“I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about us disciples. I’ve been treated as a grandson by Jing Daoxian, and Hui Haifeng has become president. Little Ya is the president of the Holy Spirit Association. If I’m not wrong, that Immortal from the League of Guardians is very likely Jiang Yan. Together with you, all the disciples he took in don’t seem simple. He took in those few disciples after all those years, but they all have achievements that ordinary people can’t achieve. Don’t you find it very unlikely? Apart from our teacher, have you seen anyone else with such abilities?” Liu Yun said with a strange expression.

Zhou Wen had actually had such a feeling before, but he didn’t say it out loud like Liu Yun.
