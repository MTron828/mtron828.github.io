Chapter 1133: Let’s Get Married

Zhou Wen was dumbfounded, unsure what was going on.

He had never been confessed to in his life, much less by a dimensional creature, even less a Calamity-grade dimensional creature.

Although the woman looked beautiful and had a strange charm that humans didn’t possess, Zhou Wen was a more traditional human. He found it unacceptable to have a love that transcended species.

“We don’t seem to be creatures of the same species, right?” Zhou Wen gave a measured response. He didn’t dare reject her too directly, afraid that he would anger this terrifying Calamity-grade existence.

If she flew into a rage out of humiliation and completely unleashed her Calamity-grade strength, even if Zhou Wen could escape through teleportation, a large area would probably be affected by the calamity.

“Will you marry me or not?” The woman was much more straightforward than Zhou Wen. She pulled out the crescent-like saber in her arms and pointed it at Zhou Wen. It was as though she would chop off his head if he said no.

Zhou Wen hated being threatened, so he immediately teleported again. At most, he could use the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art to escape to other planets and return after the woman left Earth.

In the past, Zhou Wen hadn’t advanced to the Mythical stage, so his physique hadn’t been enough for him to survive in space. Now, with his Mythical body, as long as he didn’t encounter overly terrifying energy eruptions or radiation, surviving for a period of time wasn’t a problem.

After teleporting out, Zhou Wen’s expression suddenly changed. He found himself in front of the woman again. He had failed to appear where he wanted to go.

With the augmentation of Clown Mask, Zhou Wen saw that the surrounding space had become extremely strange. The sea and sky formed a line, intersecting and distorting the location of the moon. It transformed the nearby area into an independent space that resembled a Möbius loop.

This spatial connection was completely severed from the outside world. No matter how Zhou Wen teleported, he was still in this space and couldn’t leave.

Only then did Zhou Wen realize that this Calamity-grade woman was far more terrifying than he had imagined.

“Are you marrying me or not?” the woman continued pointing her saber at Zhou Wen as she asked expressionlessly.

“Ahem, why do you want me to marry you?” Zhou Wen felt that one shouldn’t be too hot-tempered. It was best to reason and negotiate.

The woman didn’t answer Zhou Wen’s question. She still pointed her saber at him and stared straight at him. Clearly, she only wanted an answer and didn’t wish to answer the question.

Seeing that the woman didn’t take action directly, Zhou Wen continued, “Legend has it that the bride on Bride Island married three brothers, but all three brothers died. Don’t tell me you are that legendary bride?”

The woman finally spoke. “How can the place where I live be a place where mortals live?”

Although the woman didn’t say if she was the bride, she had indirectly admitted that the myth did exist. The deaths of the three brothers were related to her.

“I’m also a mortal. Don’t tell me you want to marry me before killing me?” Zhou Wen asked again. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“No,” the woman answered with certainty.

“Why?” Zhou Wen pressed.

“Are you marrying me or not?” The woman clearly didn’t wish to answer this question as she once again forced Zhou Wen to give an answer.

“Since you wish to marry a human, you should at least follow human rules, right?” Zhou Wen wanted to stall for time to see if he could find a way to escape.

“We can get married immediately by doing the rites.” The woman clearly knew some human rules, but the rules she knew seemed to be ancient.

“Those are rules from the past. Things these days are different.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he attempted to use the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art to escape, but it was useless. The stars in the pocket universe were dim. In this strange space, it was clearly impossible to use interstellar teleportation.

“Oh, what are the rules now?” the woman asked with a frown.

“Rules these days talk about free love. If you want to get married, you have to fall in love with the other party first,” Zhou Wen said as he stalled for time.

The woman seemed to understand Zhou Wen’s words as she sheathed her saber.

Zhou Wen secretly heaved a sigh of relief, believing that he had finally convinced the woman. All he needed to do was find an excuse to escape from her.

However, to his surprise, after she sheathed her sword, the woman began to take off her clothes and walk towards Zhou Wen.

“What are you doing...” Zhou Wen was alarmed.

“Isn’t the so-called love of humans just lust? You said that you can only marry if you fall in love with the other party. I can do it now,” the woman said as she continued walking towards Zhou Wen.

“Stop. Who did you hear that from? It’s not like that at all.” Zhou Wen retreated as he called for a stop.

“What is it then?” the woman stopped and asked Zhou Wen.

“That’s... That’s...” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and couldn’t think of something. All he could do was say what he could think of. “It’s just that the two of them need to understand each other and see if their personalities are compatible or if their thoughts are compatible...”

“Humans are still as hypocritical as ever,” the woman said with a frown. After a pause, she continued, “Then let’s get to understand each other. We shall get married after understanding each other. How do you want to understand me?”

Zhou Wen looked at the woman in a daze, momentarily at a loss for words.

Understand? What the hell? Zhou Wen had no intention of dating a dimensional creature.

Ignoring dimensional creatures, even if a living person stood in front of Zhou Wen, he wouldn’t know how to date her, much less a terrifying Calamity-grade creature.

“That... That... Why don’t we watch a movie first...” Zhou Wen recalled that Li Xuan had once said that if he felt bored dating girls, he would take them to the movies. He had at least an hour and a half to relax or sleep.

Zhou Wen felt that this wasn’t a bad idea. Perhaps he could take this opportunity to think of a way to escape this woman’s clutches.

“What’s a movie?” the woman asked with a frown.

Zhou Wen roughly explained what a movie was. The woman nodded. “Alright, let’s watch a movie.”

“Going to a movie is a very pleasant thing. If we end up covered in blood, it will affect our mood. Shouldn’t we restrain ourselves a little...” Zhou Wen was already beginning to regret taking a Calamity creature to a human city to catch a movie. Zhou Wen felt that this idea was too stupid. He didn’t know what was wrong with him to come up with such a stupid idea.

“It’s inauspicious to get married when there’s death. I understand,” the woman said calmly.

“I still don’t know your name?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.

“Tsukuyomi,” the woman answered.
