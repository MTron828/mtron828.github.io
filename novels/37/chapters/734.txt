Chapter 735: Creditor Comes Knocking

Translator: CKtalon

Ever since he entered the Imperial Capital, Zhou Wen felt all sorts of gazes staring at him. Furthermore, there were definitely more than one or two people staring at him.

It was almost impossible to enter the Forbidden City without anyone noticing.

Do I have to barge my way in? Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant.

Although his present strength could be considered top-notch in the Federation and he had many Mythical Companion Beasts, he probably wouldn’t be able to gain an advantage against a hero family.

After all, they had been operating for decades. Even if they didn’t have a phone to grind for resources, they definitely had a lot of resources in real life.

What puzzled Zhou Wen was that despite a large number of spies staring at him, no one attacked him despite him being in the capital for so long.

When did the bureau become so good-tempered? They actually haven’t come looking for trouble? Zhou Wen felt that there was something amiss.

Zhou Wen was right. Something had happened on the way.

However, due to an accident, the Dugu family, who had originally planned to attack him, aborted the operation. The bureau was waiting for the Xia family to take action, and because the Xia family wanted Xia Liuchuan to win the bet, they allowed him to arrive at the Imperial Capital safely.

Now that the Xia family was waiting for Xia Liuchuan to sign a contract with the Guardian, everything was calm.

As he was thinking, he felt a fluctuation from a Companion Beast. Explosive Fiend Man that had evolved again had finally completed its evolution.

Zhou Wen checked Explosive Fiend Man’s stats in-game.

Explosive Fiend Man: Epic (Evolvable)

Life Providence: Unlawful

Life Soul: Destroyer

Strength: 41

Speed: 41 Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Constitution: 41

Essence Energy: 41

Talent Skill: Death List, Time-Blast

Companion Form: Self-detonation Device

His stats had risen in a normal fashion. His skills hadn’t changed, but he had gained a Life Soul.

Zhou Wen summoned Explosive Fiend Man in-game. It didn’t look much different from when it was at the Legendary stage. It looked like a very modern armored soldier.

Let me see what use your Life Soul has. Zhou Wen got Explosive Fiend Man to use the Destroyer Life Soul.

With a thought, the red liquid in the glass tubes on Explosive Fiend Man’s back injected into his body through the pipes. Then, Zhou Wen saw Explosive Fiend Man’s armor emitting strange red flames. Its body was filled with a dangerous aura.

Explosive Fiend Man seemed to have been injected with stimulants. His Speed and Strength had greatly increased, and his skills had also been strengthened.

Previously, he needed at least thirty seconds to complete a Time-Blast. However, with the augmentation of the Destroyer Life Soul, he only used less than three seconds to complete a Time-Blast. His efficiency had increased by ten times.

This Destroyer Life Soul is quite strong! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. In the past, Explosive Fiend Man’s skill cast time was too slow, so it wasn’t convenient to use it.

Although the speed of a skill at three seconds was still a little slow, much slower than an instantaneous skill, considering Explosive Fiend Man’s special skill, three seconds was considered rather powerful.

I can consider using Explosive Fiend Man to set up some time bombs nearby. If anyone tries to sneak up on me, I’ll make sure they have no chance of returning. Zhou Wen only had this thought. After all, this was a hotel. It wouldn’t be good if he injured the workers who were cleaning up the room.

If Explosive Fiend Man advances to the Mythical stage, I might be able to instantly release a time bomb. That would be awesome. Zhou Wen looked forward to Explosive Fiend Man’s growth.

The doorbell rang. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to take a look and was immediately stunned. The person standing outside the door was Wang Lu.

Zhou Wen hurriedly opened the door. When Wang Lu saw him, she said unhappily, “You didn’t inform me, your debtor, despite coming to the Imperial Capital? Are you trying to renege on your debt?”

“Sorry, I encountered some trouble. I originally planned on contacting you after resolving it, but I never expected you to come here yourself. By the way, how did you know that I was in the Imperial Capital?” Zhou Wen asked.

“What’s so strange about that? After all, our Wang family has some influence in the Imperial Capital. For a famous person like you to come to the Imperial Capital, I have no choice but to know. This news keeps buzzing around my ears. It’s so irritating that I can’t sleep,” Wang Lu said.

“As you know, I’m in a lot of trouble now. I don’t have the time to eat with you for the time being. Go back now and I’ll look for you when I’m done with my matters,” Zhou Wen said.

Zhou Wen mainly didn’t want his matter to implicate Wang Lu, but when Wang Lu heard that, she curled her lips and said, “If you want to renege on your debt, just say so. Why do you have to come up with so many excuses? Since I came looking for you, I’m naturally not afraid of trouble. Why are you being so wishy-washy? Don’t tell me you don’t even have time to go downstairs to eat?”

“It’s not that I don’t have time, but it’s really inconvenient.” Zhou Wen pointed at the wooden log under his buttocks and said, “I have to carry this with me at all times. Where do you think I can eat conveniently when I have to take it with me?”

“What’s this? Why are you carrying it? Just leave it in the room. If you find it unsafe, I’ll get someone to look after it for you,” Wang Lu said.

“It’s not about safety. I can’t leave it. I have to carry it with me. It’s a long story,” Zhou Wen said helplessly.

Wang Lu thought for a moment and said, “It doesn’t matter. Just take it with you and follow me. I’ll find a place. It’s very quiet there. That place can easily accommodate a few more logs of the same size.”

“That’s not very nice, right? You know that my relationship with the bureau isn’t good. This is where the headquarters of the bureau is...” Zhou Wen really didn’t wish for Wang Lu to be embroiled in his matters.

“Cut the crap. I don’t like hearing that. Just follow me.” Having known him for so long, Wang Lu knew Zhou Wen’s temper quite well. There was no need to waste her breath on him. All she needed to do was drag him away.

“I’m afraid it will affect your family.” Zhou Wen had no choice but to make things clear.

“I’ve already said it. Since I dared to come, I’m naturally not afraid. Although the bureau is very powerful, they can’t do anything to me. Don’t worry. Quickly follow me. I didn’t eat anything the entire morning just to eat this meal of yours. I’m starving,” Wang Lu said.

The chick smartly flew onto Wang Lu’s shoulder. Even the antelope took the initiative to approach her and fawned over her. Zhou Wen had no choice but to carry the wooden log and follow Wang Lu.

Looking at Wang Lu teasing the chick in front of him, Zhou Wen’s mood improved significantly. Under such circumstances, it was indeed rare for Wang Lu to be willing to seek him out. Typical schoolmates would probably keep their distance from him.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that Wang Lu was taking him to a restaurant, but to his surprise, Wang Lu brought him all the way to a traditionally-styled ancient building complex.

After circling the alley for a while, he entered one of the ancient buildings’ courtyard.
