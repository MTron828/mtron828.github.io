Chapter 1048: Time’s Up

Translator: CKtalon

Which Companion Beast should I send out? Zhou Wen mainly didn’t want others to know that these Companion Beasts belonged to him, so he didn’t want to use his signature Companion Beast to fight. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have needed to consider so much.

After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to get the newly hatched Devil Clown to fight. Then, he did the math. Invisibility Cloak, Golden Battle God Halberd, five Demon Blood True Dragons, Medusa, Ancient Splitting Tadpole, and Devil Clown. I’ll need at most three more Mythical Companion Beasts to drag it out for twenty-four hours. After twenty-four hours, I can get the Companion Beasts I previously fought to challenge again. It shouldn’t be difficult to last for forty-eight hours.

Although he had this plan in mind, Zhou Wen didn’t believe that dimensional creatures would really let him stall for time. Perhaps there would be a new technique that would prevent him from stalling.

I can only take it one step at a time. I wonder what Zhong Ziya is doing. Why must I help him stall for 48 hours? Zhou Wen had considered this problem before, but he couldn’t figure out the reason.

When the Devil Clown appeared in the arena, it caused another heated discussion.

“Another new Mythical Companion Beast I’ve never seen before. Amazing. How many Mythical Companion Beasts does he have?”

“Devil Clown, where does this Companion Beast come from? I’ve never heard of it before.”

“Now, we can confirm that this is a family clan’s operation, right? It’s impossible for one person to have so many Mythical Companion Beasts.”

Soon, the media in the North District revealed the origins of the Devil Clown. They explained in detail how terrifying the Maze of Lies was and how terrifying the dimensional zone on Sunday was.

“It’s actually a Mythical Companion Beast from the North District. Now, all the Mythical Companion Beasts in the North, South, East, and West District are here. How do we guess? Which district’s family are they from?”

Now, most people believed that it couldn’t be a person. It had to be a family.

The six families and some wealthy families were also investigating who these Companion Beasts belonged to. With so many Mythical Companion Beasts, even in this rapidly developing era with more and more Mythical Companion Beasts appearing, the impact was still terrifying.

However, after repeated investigations, no family clan met the requirements.

“What Companion Beast will appear next? I’m really looking forward to it.”

“If so many Mythical Companion Beasts belong to the same person, how strong is this person?”

“Impossible. Even among the six families, no one has so many Mythical Companion Beasts.”

“That’s true. It’s too difficult.”

Everyone was looking forward to the appearance of a new Companion Beast. They wanted to know how many Mythical Companion Beasts this mysterious unknown family clan could produce.

Another two hours passed. When the Night Immaculate Sword appeared, the Xia family quickly recognized it.

This was because someone from the Xia family had once fought the Night Immaculate Sword, but no Companion Beast dropped. Now that they saw Night Immaculate Sword appear in the arena, the Xia family was puzzled. Who was it that managed to get the Night Immaculate Sword drop? It only appeared in the Ancient Sword Tomb that the Xia family controlled. This was too strange.

After the origins of the Night Immaculate Sword were revealed, many people suspected that the family with these Companion Beasts was the Xia family.

If one wasn’t from the Xia family, one was forbidden from entering the Ancient Sword Tomb. Therefore, the owner of Night Immaculate Sword was very likely from the Xia family.

As people were making all sorts of guesses, another two hours later, a Companion Beast named Dragon Tiger Pill Essence appeared in the cube’s arena.

The Zhang family couldn’t sit still upon seeing this. The most precious pill essence in Pill Furnace Mountain wasn’t the Mythical Life Regeneration Pill or the Resurrection Pill, but the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence that Zhou Wen had managed to obtain.

Although all of them were at the Mythical stage, the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence had the characteristics of the Rejuvenation Pill and the Resurrection Pill. It was a divine pill that could virtually revive the dead.

Of course, the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence wasn’t really able to revive the dead. However, to a certain extent, it could heal injuries that resuscitation couldn’t.

However, as the chances of the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence appearing were too low, the Zhang family had only encountered it a few times. None of them had dropped Companion Beasts.

However, Pill Furnace Mountain was a restricted area of the Zhang family. Outsiders were unable to enter. Now, someone had used the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence that the Zhang family didn’t have. How could the Zhang family not be alarmed?

The people who originally suspected the Xia family began to suspect the Zhang family. After all, the Zhang family’s pill essence was just too famous.

The Zhang family was also doing its best to investigate. They wanted to know when the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence had dropped, but there was no result.

All sorts of guesses flew around the Federation. Now, everyone wanted to know who the family that had these Companion Beasts was. However, no matter how many guesses they made, they couldn’t confirm it. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The entity had Mythical Companion Beasts from all four districts. It was very difficult to guess.

...

“Young Master Zhou Wen’s luck with Companion Beasts is too good. I really wonder how he managed to have so many Mythical Companion Beasts drop.” An Sheng couldn’t help but marvel when he saw the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence.

“It’s just luck,” An Tianzuo said.

An Sheng said with a bitter expression, “Overseer, why don’t we get Young Master Wen to join us the next time we hunt a Mythical creature?”

“Why will you be inviting him? Can’t we kill it ourselves?” An Tianzuo snorted coldly.

“We can kill them, but in the past two months, we’ve killed more than ten Mythical creatures. Quite a number of dimensional crystals dropped, but none of the Companion Beasts dropped...” An Sheng said helplessly.

The corners of An Tianzuo’s eyes twitched. His luck hadn’t been good recently. He had killed quite a number of Mythical creatures, but he just couldn’t get a Companion Egg to drop.

“It has nothing to do with the person. Just kill more,” An Tianzuo said expressionlessly.

“Yes, Overseer. Then let’s kill more,” An Sheng said solemnly.

“How’s Little Jing now?” An Tianzuo asked after some thought.

“Miss Jing has been cultivating at Chess Mountain’s encampment. Now, Miss Jing is much more composed. She has made quite a number of contributions and is very respected,” An Sheng said.

“That’s good.” An Tianzuo nodded slightly.

...

Now, the entire Federation and even the overseas factions were discussing what new Mythical Companion Beasts would be joining the battle.

When the Evil Spirit King appeared, no one knew what Companion Beast it was. They had never even heard of it before, so they couldn’t obtain any information through investigations.

Another two hours passed. Under the attention of everyone, a new Companion Beast appeared, but on careful look, there was nothing. On careful look, they realized that the Companion Beast that issued the challenge was the Invisibility Cloak.

Only then did people realize that twenty-four hours had passed. The Invisibility Cloak that had previously issued a challenge could now be used again.
