Chapter 700: The Last 72 Hours

Translator: CKtalon

After Primordial Sword Immortal was sent flying, he immediately flew into the air and slashed out rows of sword beams in all directions.

However, other than Primordial Sword Immortal and his sword beams, Zhou Wen and An Sheng saw nothing.

“An invisible Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen and An Sheng could see the surprise in each other’s eyes.

Invisibility Companion Beasts were rare. Zhou Wen had an Invisibility Cloak Companion Egg, but it was a problematic Companion Egg. He hadn’t managed to hatch it yet.

Apart from that, he had also heard of some Companion Beasts that could be invisible. However, they weren’t absolutely invisible.

For example, a Companion Beast named Chameleon could fuse with the environment through Chameleon Transformation and reach the goal of invisibility.

However, this kind of invisibility was basically useless against top-notch experts.

Ignoring Mythical creatures, even Epic experts like Zhou Wen’s Hell King Life Soul could sense minute changes in the airflow.

To just be visually invisible wasn’t of much use against top-notch experts.

It was only when dealing with special skills like the Bright Torch Vision World that invisibility had some effect.

What was truly terrifying wasn’t visual invisibility, but complete invisibility. Even one’s body could be concealed. It wouldn’t cause any airflow, emit heat, or produce a lifeforce field. It was as if one had vanished into thin air.

Only then could an existence like Primordial Sword Immortal not discover its location.

In the battle arena’s situation, Primordial Sword Immortal clearly hadn’t discovered the enemy’s location. All he could do was continuously slash out large swaths of sword beams, hoping to use the dense sword beams to force the enemy out.

This was clearly useless. Soon, Primordial Sword Immortal suffered another baffling strike and flew out again.

The battle scene in the arena was very strange. It was as though Primordial Sword Immortal was fighting the air, but he was constantly being attacked. The sword immortal’s spirit body was also flickering from time to time. It didn’t look good.

“There are still limitations to a livestream. Let’s go to the cube to take a look,” An Sheng said as he drove towards the cube.

There was almost no one on the other streets. The streets that could see the cube’s screen were packed with people. People couldn’t even squeeze through, never mind cars.

Even the buildings on both sides of the street were filled with people.

Zhou Wen and An Sheng had no choice but to find a place to park the car before finding a relatively closer spot to watch the battle.

The cube’s big screen could perfectly enact the real battle. It was the same as a real scene. This was something that even high-speed cameras weren’t capable of.

No matter how powerful the camera’s functions were, there were still limitations. For example, no matter how high the resolution was, it was impossible to reach the standards of the real world.

Just like the scene on the phone, Primordial Sword Immortal was still being thrashed unilaterally.

His opponent seemed to be deliberately humiliating Primordial Sword Immortal. Every strike was like an invisible fist striking Primordial Sword Immortal’s face, sending him flying.

Again and again, it struck. It wasn’t in a rush to finish off Primordial Sword Immortal. It was as though it wanted to appreciate Primordial Sword Immortal’s sorry state.

Ever since Primordial Sword Immortal appeared out of nowhere and suppressed the rankings for a few months, accepting the challenges of many powerful Companion Beasts, he had always appeared invincible. He was practically synonymous with invincibility. When had he ever been in such a sorry state?

Primordial Sword Immortal attempted to force his opponent out by using many methods, but the outcome was not as he wished. He was completely unable to determine his opponent’s location.

Zhou Wen looked at the name on the ranking. The Companion Beast that challenged Primordial Sword Immortal was named “Origin Realm King”, but he didn’t see the image of Origin Realm King.

Could it be that Origin Realm King is invisible? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

The battle continued in a one-sided manner. The invincible Primordial Sword Immortal was helpless against an invisible opponent. All he could do was passively take a beating.

“It looks like the number one spot on the rankings will finally be changed.”

“Origin Realm King, why have I never heard of it before?”

“Indeed, invisible opponents are the most terrifying. Origin Realm King is too powerful. To be able to beat Primordial Sword Immortal to such a state, it’s practically invincible.”

“I wonder who the Origin Realm King belongs to?”

“That’s hard to guess. I’ve only heard of legends about the Divine Realm, the Immortal Realm, the Fiend Realm, the Spirit Realm, the Ghost Realm, the Demon Realm, and so on. I’ve never heard of the Origin Realm.”

“Could it be from overseas?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Probably not. If the Origin Realm King is from overseas, I’d rather support Primordial Sword Immortal taking first place.”

The entire Federation was abuzz with discussion. Primordial Sword Immortal was clearly at a disadvantage. Although he hadn’t used his Wheel of Destiny and still had the ability to deliver a final blow, his chances of winning were much lower.

This was because most people determined that Primordial Sword Immortal’s Wheel of Destiny was an offensive skill. He didn’t even know where his opponent was, so the effects of the Wheel of Destiny were too limited. Unless Primordial Sword Immortal’s Wheel of Destiny had a huge area of effect, it was difficult to turn defeat into victory.

Zhou Wen watched the battle the entire time. He had even used the Holy Hell King’s Eye, but he still couldn’t see where Origin Realm King was.

What powerful invisibility. It can even hide the sinflames on its body? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.

“From the looks of it, we should be able to see Primordial Sword Immortal’s Wheel of Destiny.” An Sheng also believed that Primordial Sword Immortal had been forced into a corner.

It wasn’t only An Sheng. The six families and many experts also believed so. At this stage, Primordial Sword Immortal couldn’t sit idle.

Just as everyone was hoping that Primordial Sword Immortal would release his Wheel of Destiny, something unexpected happened.

Primordial Sword Immortal actually chose to forfeit and gave up the throne of first place. He didn’t use the power of his Wheel of Destiny.

The entire Federation was in an uproar. After occupying the rankings for months, the invincible Primordial Sword Immortal had been defeated just like that. First place was given to someone else, and Primordial Realm King became the strongest Companion Beast in the world.

Since Primordial Sword Immortal didn’t use his Wheel of Destiny, it meant that he knew that he couldn’t win even if he used it.

There were less than four days left before the three-month deadline Wang Mingyuan mentioned was reached.

All the major media outlets in the Federation were reporting on the matter of Origin Realm King taking first place. They were also guessing who its owner was.

Just like Primordial Sword Immortal, the owner of Origin Realm King had never appeared. All the speculation was nothing but speculation.

However, according to the deductions of the six families, it was very likely that Origin Realm King was an overseas Companion Beast. This was because, in the legends of the Federation’s four districts, there didn’t seem to be a place like the Origin Realm.

While people were guessing the origins and true colors of the Origin Realm King, the cubes around the world underwent a strange change. Each cube displayed a 72-hour countdown.

Anyone with a smidgen of intelligence could roughly guess what it meant. There were less than 72 hours left before the three-month deadline.
