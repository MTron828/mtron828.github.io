Chapter 1755 Zhou’s Disciples

On the rankings, there were only a few simple words—”Zhou’s Disciple, Feng Qiuyan.” It wasn’t as fancy as Ming Xiu’s. It was just like Feng Qiuyan’s character-simple and direct.

However, these few simple words made everyone go crazy. If Ming Xiu was only joking previously, to have another person use the title of Zhou’s disciple made the seemingly joke title become intriguing.

Furthermore, even if Feng Qiuyan wasn’t Zhou Wen’s student, he was definitely under Zhou Wen like Ming Xiu. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have given such a name.

For two experts to suddenly appear on the rankings of a previously unknown human faction was terrifying enough.

Furthermore, there were only two humans on this ranking so far. It could be said that they stood above the entire Federation.

“Another of Zhou’s disciples. Is this for real?”

“Is Zhou Wen really very strong?”

“Could they really be Zhou Wen’s students?”

“It must be fake. How can such a thing happen? To have two Calamity-grade students who can enter the Cube’s rankings, it can only happen if Zhou Wen is an immortal!”

“Professor Gu, what’s your take? Could Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan really be Zhou Wen’s students?” Su Yi said excitedly.

“That… It’s hard to say… However, typically speaking, no one will joke on such matters. However, to say that someone about their age can teach two students like them is a little too odd…” Professor Gu said ambiguously. He didn’t dare to make any certain claims.

Previously, when Ming Xiu gave this name, almost no one believed it. They thought it was a joke, but now, everyone was doubtful. They weren’t so sure if it was a joke, but they couldn’t believe it.

“I was wondering how powerful you were. So it’s another alien representative. He’s clearly the representative of the Phaseless race. What’s the difference between him and that Inter representative from before?” In any case, having said something similar, the girl clearly felt less burdened when she said such words. She spoke with a righteous tone.

Zhou Wen didn’t mind. In fact, Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu could really be considered his disciples.

If it was in the past, because Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu had excellent talent and relied on themselves to figure things out, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have dared to admit that he had taught them. Now, Zhou Wen could say with a clear conscience that he had indeed taught them.

If Zhou Wen hadn’t used the Teacher Domain to raise their realms and deduce their flaws, how could they have advanced to the Heaven level so quickly?

In fact, even without the matter regarding the girl, Zhou Wen had spent so much time and effort teaching them so that they could pluck the golden apple. A bet with the girl was just an additional boon to him.

Of course, the Teacher Domain was amazing, but it also depended on Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu’s aptitudes and perceptivity. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to receive such a good effect. The Teacher Domain couldn’t teach a fool to be the strongest in the world. It could only be considered guiding and developing their potential.

“So this doesn’t count either? Then let’s have another one,” Zhou Wen said to the girl.

“Hmph, don’t tell me it’s another representative of some race?” The girl snorted coldly.

“Since you have such good eyesight, does she look like a representative of some race?” Zhou Wen pointed at Qin Zhen.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, the girl sized up Qin Zhen. A strange ripple flashed in her eyes, making her eyes appear like an abyss with layers of fog overlapping.

“She’s not a representative,” the girl said with certainty as she retracted her gaze. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Then if she leaves her name on the rankings, you won’t go back on your word, right?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Who went back on their word? You were the one who cheated,” the girl immediately retorted.

“Just say it. If she enters the rankings, will you admit defeat or not?” Zhou Wen didn’t argue with her as he said indifferently.

Although the girl felt that Zhou Wen definitely had the confidence to say such words, she was irrevocably committed. All she could do was bite the bullet and say, “As long as she’s really your disciple, I’ll naturally admit defeat.”

“Alright,” Zhou Wen responded and turned to Qin Zhen. “Take it steady. Don’t fool around.”

“Yes,” Qin Zhen replied. She turned around and walked towards the Cube to activate it again.

“Why? Are you so unconfident of a disciple you taught?” When the girl heard Zhou Wen’s exhortations to Qin Zhen, she imagined that Zhou Wen was worried that she wouldn’t be able to clear the level. She immediately felt emboldened and teased Zhou Wen.

“I’m afraid that she will have too much fun,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

He wasn’t worried that Qin Zhen wouldn’t be able to clear the level. Previously, he had taught Feng Qiuyan, Ming Xiu, and Qin Zhen together. Ming Qiuyan and Ming Xiu had their own paths, and Zhou Wen had only played a supporting role.

However, Qin Zhen was different. The path she had taken was Zhou Wen’s to begin with. It could be said that Zhou Wen had guided Qin Zhen all the way.

Zhou Wen was a man, but Qin Zhen was a woman. The Immortal Slaying that Zhou Wen had developed was domineering, and Qin Zhen had an especially stubborn personality.

She believed in Zhou Wen and the path he had pointed out, so she firmly took it without any detours or diversions.

However, women were fundamentally different from men. This wasn’t discrimination, but simply physical differences.

Qin Zhen was unbending. Furthermore, as a woman, she pushed the domineeringness to an even higher level.

This couldn’t be considered a mistake. Not being adaptable wasn’t a flaw. However, the outcome of doing so was to make Qin Zhen’s sword art extreme and domineering.

Clearing the level wasn’t a problem, but being excessively hard made things brittle. Zhou Wen was afraid that Qin Zhen would be too extreme and take risks, resulting in injury.

The reason he got Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan to challenge the level first was to give Qin Zhen time to prepare to prevent her from injuring herself by being too unyielding.

He was bound to win, but Zhou Wen wanted zero damage; he wasn’t worried about winning or losing

“What’s going on today? Another person is attempting the level again? And it’s a woman?” Su Yi couldn’t help but be surprised when she saw Qin Zhen appear on the screen.

Donned in white armor and a silver helm, Qin Zhen’s outstanding figure was accentuated by her long and slender legs. Even if one couldn’t see her face, her figure and aura made one feel that she was a beauty.

“Can someone tell me who this woman is?”

“She doesn’t even show her face. Who can tell? However, she shouldn’t be another of Zhou’s, right?”

“Who knows? What if it’s another of Zhou’s disciples?”

“That’s impossible. A single Guide City producing three ranked experts?”

“These legs… This figure… is really amazing…”

“After Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan, all sorts of people are appearing. I wonder which family she belongs to. There are quite a number of female representatives in the six families; I just wonder who she is.”

“Why doesn’t she show her face? If she dies inside, no one will remember her? This figure… Tsk, tsk…”

Everyone discussed spiritedly as they guessed where Qin Zhen came from and if she could clear the level like Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan.
