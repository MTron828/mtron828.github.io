Chapter 1537: Returning to the Hut

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen didn’t know if the light blast used by the Calamity creature on Dubhe was considered a high-temperature power that the Tiger Soul General could accept. Logically speaking, it was a power similar to high-temperature radiation. It should be within the range of the Tiger Soul General’s absorption.

If the Tiger Soul General couldn’t absorb and convert that power for its own use, it would probably die instantly if it relied on its own strength.

After all, even the Prisoned Dragon armor with Absolute Defense couldn’t withstand it for long. Although the Tiger Soul General’s defense was very strong, it was still inferior to Prisoned Dragon’s Absolute Defense.

After launching the Dubhe dungeon, Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors as per his previous plan. He used the Chaos Egg as protection and wore the Prisoned Dragon armor. It allowed him to last a little longer when the Chaos Egg exploded.

The difference this time was that the Tiger Soul General was standing beside Zhou Wen.

The moment the door opened, the Golden Wyrm Scissors charged at the amethyst-armored creature. The amethyst-armored creature didn’t hesitate to release an omnipresent, sun-like light blast.

I hope the Tiger Soul General can hold on for a little longer.?Zhou Wen didn’t have extravagant hopes of the Tiger Soul General lasting as long as the Chaos Egg; he just didn’t want him to be instantly killed.

Zhou Wen kept sensing the Tiger Soul General to see when he would be killed by the light blast, but to his surprise, the Tiger Soul General wasn’t killed despite Zhou Wen waiting for quite some time.

Instead, it was Zhou Wen himself. Without Tyrant Behemoth as a trash can for his transferred solid crystals, the Chaos Egg lasted for a much shorter period of time.

The Tiger Soul General remained alive when the Chaos Egg was destroyed and the game screen went black.

From the looks of it, the Tiger Soul General can also absorb the power of the amethyst-armored creature’s light blast and use it for himself. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to last so long.

?Zhou Wen was delighted and alarmed.

For the Tiger Soul General to last so long, he must have become very strong. Zhou Wen didn’t know the limits of the Tiger Soul General’s strength. If he could become stronger without end, it would be terrifying. Perhaps he could defy the heavens and kill Dubhe’s dimensional creature.

Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s beautiful wish. In fact, any skill had its limits. It was impossible for Tiger Soul General to become stronger indefinitely. His body couldn’t withstand such terrifying power.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t even have the chance to give it a shot and try his luck. This was because he couldn’t last until the Tiger Soul General became stronger. Once Zhou Wen died, the game would end, depriving the chance for Tiger Soul General to become that strong.

Zhou Wen suddenly realized that he was the one who was the greatest burden.

No, I have to think of a way to live a little longer. It’s fine if I can’t fight, but I can’t even protect myself. That makes me a little too useless.?Zhou Wen thought hard, hoping to become stronger.

“It’s impossible to last that long with just the Chaos Egg. Even when Tyrant Behemoth was still around, it only lasted a little longer. It doesn’t mean much. I have to last longer,” Zhou Wen muttered to himself.

The best solution he could think of was to advance the Chaos Egg to the Calamity grade, but this was the dimension. Ignoring finding a suitable dimensional zone, there were no dimensional zones here.

I can’t return now. What should I do??As Zhou Wen thought about it, his eyes suddenly lit up. I wonder if I can use the dungeon’s power to advance to the Calamity grade in-game?

He tried it the moment he thought of it, but Zhou Wen didn’t know which of the dungeons he had downloaded could be used to advance to the Calamity grade.

Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t know if the game dungeons would work. All he could do was slowly experiment.

Zhou Wen thought of the game dungeons he had which corresponded to the Essence Energy Arts he cultivated. If there was a similar type, Zhou Wen would try his luck.

The First Order of Chaos is an Essence Energy Art from the West, but I haven’t downloaded many Western game dungeons. None of them seem to be compatible with it. If I had known this would happen, I would have downloaded more dungeons from the West District…?Zhou Wen regretted it too late.

Wait…?Zhou Wen suddenly thought of a dimensional zone. It was Sweetie’s Hut—the Time Hut.

There were four rooms—Past, Present, Future, and Chaos. Zhou Wen wondered if the latter had anything to do with the First Order of Chaos since it had the name ‘Chaos.’

However, Sweetie is God. The Time Hut is a dimensional zone under God. The First Order of Chaos is an Essence Energy Art from Zeus’s pantheon. The two aren’t of the same type. I wonder if they can be used together.?Zhou Wen decided to try his luck.

In fact, Zhou Wen had already used the Chaos Egg to enter the Time Hut a long time ago. Only the Chaos Egg could withstand the temporal powers of the Time Hut.

However, Zhou Wen hadn’t thought in that direction back then, so he hadn’t paid attention.

Once again, he entered the Time Hut under the Chaos Egg’s protection. Nothing here had changed much. Zhou Wen didn’t dare enter the Past Hut or the Future Hut.

He went to the Chaos Hut to take a look, but he didn’t find anything.

There weren’t many things in the room to begin with. Zhou Wen touched them all, but he didn’t sense any abnormal changes.

Is the power of the Chaos Hut incompatible with the First Order of Chaos, or can I not just advance to the Calamity grade in-game??Zhou Wen couldn’t be sure of the possibilities. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, Zhou Wen was somewhat unwilling to return just like that.

After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to visit the Future Hut again.

The Past Hut allowed him to return to the past, and the Future Hut likely sent him to the future. However, the Future Hut was an empty void.

Zhou Wen had always been brooding over this matter. He didn’t know what it meant.

If that was the future of humanity, wouldn’t it mean that humanity would perish in the future?

Now that Zhou Wen was much stronger than before, he wanted to enter again to take a look. Perhaps he could see something.

When he entered the Future Hut again, the scene Zhou Wen saw was the same as before. The phone screen was pitch-black as though it had been switched off.

Due to his experience, Zhou Wen directly activated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and used Human Sovereign’s power to illuminate his surroundings.

The Ancient Sovereign Sutra was already at the Calamity grade, so its energy was much stronger than before. In the past, Zhou Wen could only illuminate a very small area, but now, he could illuminate dozens of meters.

However, light couldn’t fully illuminate the Future Hut. What truly illuminated the darkness was the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s potent vitality.

The moment his surroundings were illuminated, Zhou Wen carefully observed them. The scene he saw delighted him.

This was because Zhou Wen realized that this wasn’t a completely empty world.. Beneath him were some objects, but Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to tell what was below.
