Chapter 752: Dark Clouds

Translator: CKtalon

Old Master Xia clearly wasn’t in the mood to continue listening to them. With a flash, he appeared in front of Zhou Wen like a devil and struck out at him.

The flames on his palm were like a blazing sun that burned everything. When Zhou Wen saw that the flames could even burn through the void, he immediately knew that it wasn’t an ordinary fire-elemental power. He didn’t dare take it head-on as he spread out his six wings and rapidly retreated.

However, a pair of Golden-Winged Roc Life Soul wings appeared behind Old Master Xia, greatly increasing his speed. Zhou Wen wasn’t able to open the distance between them, so the flames were about to strike his chest.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to slash out his Bamboo Blade at Old Master Xia’s palm.

When Bamboo Blade came into contact with the flames, the flames spread along Bamboo Blade and instantly enveloped his body.

The flames spewed out before extinguishing. The six wings on Zhou Wen’s back vanished as his face turned pale.

If not for Six-Winged’s Life Guardian, Zhou Wen would have died from this strike.

However, Six-Winged was also killed because of this, making it impossible for it to be revived.

“To think you have a Companion Beast that can die in your place. Your luck sure is extraordinary. However, your luck ends here.” Old Master Xia stared coldly at Zhou Wen, prepared to continue attacking.

Suddenly, a clap of thunder sounded in the sky, shocking everyone.

At some point in time, the sky was filled with dark clouds. Lightning flashed amidst the dark clouds.

Zhang Chunqiu, who was peeping outside, felt a sharp pain in his eyes. Blood tears flowed out of his eyes as he hurriedly retracted his Heavenly Eye. He didn’t dare look inside again as he looked at Forbidden City’s general direction in horror.

A storm was brewing above Forbidden City. The whole of Imperial Capital’s sky was covered in dark clouds, but Forbidden City seemed to be the center of the storm. It was especially gloomy.

Almost at the same time, Dugu Ge lost contact with his Gu worm. The two of them looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

Up to now, they had yet to figure out what had happened in Forbidden City. They had some ideas based on what they had seen, but they didn’t know if they were right. However, just the mere speculation left them shocked.

“Do you know what’s going on?” Dugu Ge pointed at the dark clouds in the sky and asked. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhang Chunqiu pinched his fingers to divine. The more he did so, the more he shook his head. “The heavenly secrets are in chaos. Nothing can be divined. The outcome is different every time, so there’s no point in divining. From the looks of it, something big is about to happen. Let’s leave this place quickly to avoid being implicated.”

“What about Loser?” Dugu Ge asked.

“I’ve previously told his fortune. He’s not destined to die. He should be able to survive this calamity.” As Zhang Chunqiu spoke, he turned around and left, as though he was being chased by a dog. He was afraid that he would be bitten by a dog if he ran too slowly.

Dugu Ge glanced in the direction of Forbidden City before leaving with Zhang Chunqiu.

...

In Forbidden City, Zhou Wen summoned Torch Dragon and said to Xia Xuanyue and company, “Leave now.”

He knew that he could only risk his life. Otherwise, he might really not be able to leave Forbidden City today.

Zhou Wen suspected that the Old Master Xia in front of him might be one of the six heroes, the invincible hero from the Xia family.

However, the Xia family’s hero had long lost his virginity. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be the Xia family now.

Wait, what if the present Xia family doesn’t have the true hero’s bloodline? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he suddenly felt that it was very possible.

As the saying went, even a vicious tiger wouldn’t eat its cubs. However, Old Master Xia was as cold-blooded and heartless to the Xia family. If they went against him in any way, he would kill them immediately. Even geniuses like Xia Xuanyue and Xia Liuchuan could be ruthlessly killed. This was definitely not something an ordinary person could do.

However, if Old Master Xia was really the hero of the Xia family and he hadn’t really lost his virginity, then all of this could be explained. This was because the Xia family didn’t have the bloodline of the hero, so he didn’t need to have any familial concerns.

Of course, all of this was just Zhou Wen’s guess. Perhaps Old Master Xia had nothing to do with the Xia family’s hero. His nature was just that ruthless.

“Ah Cheng, take Little Chuan and Little Yue back,” Old Master Xia said as he stared coldly at Zhou Wen.

He wasn’t killing Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue out of goodwill; instead, the array’s destruction meant he couldn’t prevent outsiders from spying on them. He wasn’t willing to kill Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue in front of others.

“Yes.” Ah Cheng ran towards Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue.

Zhou Wen didn’t stop him. Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue being taken away was better than them dying here. As long as they weren’t dead, there was still hope.

“Zhou Wen, live on,” Xia Xuanyue shouted at Zhou Wen as she was taken away.

I’ll live, Zhou Wen thought.

Old Master Xia glanced at Torch Dragon and said, “This should be Torch Dragon from the Zhuolu temple, right? At such a young age, you actually have so many Mythical Companion Beasts and have such attainments in martial arts. It’s enough for you to dominate the Federation. In the history of the Federation, there’s no one who had such achievements at your age.”

“I’m still inferior to you,” Zhou Wen said sincerely.

He originally believed that he was sufficiently omnipotent and could handle all kinds of crises.

Even if he was inferior to others in some aspects, Zhou Wen had always felt that he was one of the best in the Federation when it came to overall combat strength.

However, Old Master Xia was more comprehensive than him. Not only did he have multiple Life Providences and Life Souls, but he could also use them freely. He also had a Guardian. What was even more terrifying was that he didn’t plan on purely relying on the Guardian’s powers to stay at the Mythical stage. Instead, he wanted to advance to the Mythical stage with his own strength.

He had divine skills and immense strength. Furthermore, he definitely had Mythical Companion Beasts which were definitely not ordinary ones. His strength could be described as unfathomable.

Boom!

The lightning in the sky constantly interweaved as thunder boomed one after another.

Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue no longer had the ability to fight. They were forcefully taken out by Ah Cheng. Only Zhou Wen and Old Master Xia were left in front of the huge Hall of Supreme Harmony.

“You are indeed inferior to me now, but if we were born in the same era, I might not be your match. With you as the last cornerstone of my advancement to the Mythical stage, I’m very satisfied. Don’t worry. After today, I’ll take your talent, Life Providence, and Life Soul for myself and make it famous. You should be able to feel comforted in the afterlife,” Old Master Xia said as he took a step forward and arrived in front of Zhou Wen as though he had tunneled through the void.

Zhou Wen was already prepared as he put on the Jade Crystal Spirit armor. At the same time, Torch Dragon used World King Transformation. Torch Dragon’s eyes all across its body opened wide as they turned into mirrors. It was the Bright Torch Vision World in the World King Transformation state.
