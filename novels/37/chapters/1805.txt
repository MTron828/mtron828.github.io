Chapter 1806 The True Thearch

The air that rippled like water slid across Zhou Wen’s skin, but the scene in front of him didn’t change.

Nüwa Temple was still Nüwa Temple. The Nüwa jade statue remained standing in the middle of the stone house.

Standing inside, Zhou Wen turned to look outside and saw that the door had already turned into a stone wall. There wasn’t a way out at all.

Zhou Wen used the Teacher Domain to scan the entire stone house, but he didn’t discover anything. Apart from Nüwa’s jade statue, there was nothing special in the stone house, nor was there any sign of Jing Daoxian.

There should be multiple spaces, but according to Jing Daoxian, they are likely different kinds of spaces. After Jing Daoxian enters, he might not end up in Nüwa Temple. Zhou Wen stared at the Nüwa jade statue in thought.

Jing Daoxian made me have Super Jinx. If he wants me to be his beacon, there will definitely be a choice to be made. Where’s the choice? Zhou Wen walked towards the Nüwa jade statue and circled it.

Although the jade statue is extraordinary, it doesn’t have any vitality or energy fluctuations. It doesn’t seem to contain anything. Zhou Wen frowned.

Time was limited, and Zhou Wen didn’t have time to waste. Since he couldn’t discover anything abnormal, he could only use a stupid method.

With a thought, the Human Realm domain immediately enveloped the entire stone house.

...

Before Zhou Wen could use brute force, the Nüwa jade statue in the Human Realm underwent changes.

The Nüwa jade statue turned to ash and dissipated into the air inch by inch.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he immediately understood what had happened.

In the Human Realm domain, only human world rules could exist; everything else would be eliminated. In other words, this Nüwa jade statue didn’t belong to the human world. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Clang!

After the Nüwa jade statue completely dissipated, something fell out of it.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and was immediately taken aback. It was a key made of jade. Furthermore, it was very big-half a foot long

As he picked up the jade key, there was a cracking sound behind him.

He turned around and saw that the stone wall that he had entered from was shrinking to the sides, opening up an entrance again.

However, beyond the entrance wasn’t the previous entrance to Nüwa Temple, but a naturally-formed stone cave.

Zhou Wen summoned a few Companion Beasts and searched the cave, but he didn’t discover any danger.

He walked into the cave. It wasn’t deep, so it didn’t take long for him to reach the end. It was a bigger cave with stone pillars erected. Every stone pillar was connected to a chain. Where the chains gathered was a beautiful woman sitting there.

The beautiful woman was looking at him with a harmless look.

Zhou Wen was alarmed when he saw her appearance. This was because this woman looked identical to the Nüwa jade statue.

If that was all, Zhou Wen wouldn’t be so surprised. After all, there were many immortals who could live forever in myths. It was normal for a goddess like Nüwa to exist in a dimensional zone.

However, Zhou Wen sensed that the woman’s aura was that of a human. Furthermore, she was a very pure human. He couldn’t sense the aura of any alien creature.

It was unbelievable that a pure human had lived from the Mythical era to the present.

“You’re finally here,” the woman said with a smile when she saw Zhou Wen, almost unsurprised.

“You are… The Thearch…” Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly when he heard the woman’s voice. He was extremely familiar with this voice. It was The Thearch’s voice.

“What do you think?” the woman said with a smile.

“You are Nüwa?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“No.” The woman unexpectedly denied it.

“You aren’t Nüwa?” This time, it surprised Zhou Wen.

Although he had never trusted Jing Daoxian, no matter how he analyzed it, The Thearch should have been Nüwa. Furthermore, she looked identical to Nüwa’s jade statue.

“Of course not.” The woman wore a faint smile. “Do I look like your mother?”

“What do you mean? Are you saying that Nüwa is my mother? Am I really the baby my father carried out of here? My father and Nüwa…” The woman’s words sent tumultuous waves raging in Zhou Wen’s heart.

“Haha!” The woman laughed out loud.

“What are you laughing at?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

“You’re really an adorable little fool. What nonsense is on your mind? It’s true that your mother is Nüwa, but Zhou Lingfeng isn’t your biological father. He just adopted you,” the woman said with a smile.

Zhou Wen instantly felt that his brain wasn’t working. The woman had said that he was Nüwa’s child, but he wasn’t Zhou Lingfeng’s child.

Zhou Lingfeng claimed that he was Ouyang Lan’s child. Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss as to who to believe.

“What evidence do you have to say that I’m Nüwa’s child?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

“The fact that you can come here proves that you are Nüwa’s child. Apart from her child, no one can come here,” the woman said.

“That isn’t evidence,” said Zhou Wen with a shake of his head.

“Since you can’t accept it, I’ll give you some evidence that you’ll find acceptable. You cultivated the Lost Immortal Sutra, right?” the woman said.

“That’s right. Is this considered evidence?”

“Of course, other than Nüwa’s child, no one can cultivate the Lost Immortal Sutra. It’s something specially left for her child. It’s impossible for others to master it,” the woman said.

“Can’t there be an accident?” Zhou Wen still found it unbelievable.

“It’s impossible for accidents. This is because the Lost Immortal Sutra doesn’t belong to this world. Only you, who doesn’t belong to this world, can cultivate it.” The woman’s words left Zhou Wen alarmed again.

“What do you mean? Didn’t you just say that I’m Nüwa’s child? How did it become that I don’t belong to this world?” Zhou Wen couldn’t understand what the woman was saying. It was a contradiction.

“There’s no contradiction. You are Nüwa’s child, but you don’t belong to this world,” the woman said slowly.

“In that case, Nüwa isn’t from this world?” Zhou Wen asked.

“No, Nüwa is, but you aren’t.” The woman shook her head.

These words left Zhou Wen completely confused. He couldn’t understand the woman’s train of thought at all.

“What do you think Nüwa is?” the woman suddenly asked.

These words immediately made Zhou Wen’s heart stir. “Don’t tell me you want to say that Nüwa isn’t a person at all, but Earth itself?”

“You aren’t too stupid. Nüwa is the Earth that gives birth to everything,” the woman said with a smile.

“In that case, all humans and even all the creatures on Earth are Nüwa’s children,” Zhou Wen curled his lips.

“It’s different.” The woman shook her head.

“What’s different?” Zhou Wen pressed.

“Because you are a core lifeform produced by Earth. In the words of you humans, you are Earth’s Companion Beast,” the woman enunciated each word clearly.

The woman’s words left him completely dumbfounded as he stood there in a daze.
