Chapter 1368: Battling Hermit

Translator: CKtalon

“Let’s go,” Hermit said before turning into a beam of light to escape.

“Did I say that you can leave?” Zhou Wen didn’t chase after him as he said coldly.

Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, Hermit stopped.

Hermit floated in midair with a look of horror. His left arm was severed at the shoulder as blood spewed out from his stump.

When the severed arm fell from the sky, it was like tofu that had landed on invisible blades. When it landed on the ground, it had already turned into a pile of fragments.

The reason Zhou Wen didn’t appear immediately wasn’t that he wanted to watch Wei Ge’s performance. During that period of time, he had already used the invisible sword aura to set up the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array and seal off the area.

Thankfully, Hermit was lucky. His arm was the first thing that slammed into it; if his head had hit it, he would have been split into two. He wouldn’t even have the chance to react.

Hermit didn’t dare move because he didn’t know where the motionless invisible sword beams were. Rashly charging over was no different from courting death.

Cave Era’s figure flashed as she attempted to approach Hermit. She wanted to take him back to the headquarters of the League of Guardians with her temporal powers.

“I’m your opponent.” Purple flames danced like butterflies that filled the sky, sealing Cave Era’s path. Wei Ge’s flaming figure appeared behind her.

Previously, because he knew that he wasn’t a match for Cave Era and Hermit’s combined forces, Wei Ge had only dodged and had never taken the initiative to attack.

Cave Era counterattacked. Under the effects of Time Acceleration, the palm was unbelievably fast. When it struck Wei Ge, it immediately penetrated a hole in his body.

However, Wei Ge only smiled. Instead of retreating, he advanced as though he didn’t feel any pain. He came in front of Cave Era and reached out to grab her face. As for Cave Era’s entire arm, it penetrated Wei Ge’s body.

Alarmed, Cave Era quickly retreated, causing Wei Ge’s extended palm to miss. Wei Ge’s body was like flames. After Cave Era’s arm retreated, his body was automatically restored as one.

The flames flickered as Wei Ge seemed to really transform into flames. Wherever the fire butterfly appeared, he could instantly reach it like a ghost.

Unfortunately, Cave Era’s temporal powers couldn’t be underestimated. Although Wei Ge’s attacks were strange, he failed to touch Cave Era.

“Zhou Wen, you have to think it through carefully. Do you really want to become enemies with the League of Guardians? Do you know how many Guardians there are in the entire Federation? Do you know how many people want to have Guardians? As long as you are willing, you can become one of us and have the best Guardian,” Hermit said to Zhou Wen with a changing expression.

“Guardian? What kind of Guardian can you provide me? Mythical? Terror? Or Calamity?” Zhou Wen didn’t move, but the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Sword Array formed by invisible sword beams had already begun circulating as it tore through the air and attacked Hermit.

The airflow and sonic booms caused by the moving invisible sword beams gave Hermit a way to determine the attacks. As he dodged and blocked the invisible sword beams, he said, “A powerhouse like you naturally has to contract with the top Terror-grade Guardian. It also won’t be difficult for you to advance to the Calamity grade in the future.”

Zhou Wen said indifferently, “I didn’t even agree to contract a Calamity-grade Guardian. Do you think I’ll want your Terror-grade Guardian?”

Hermit suddenly transformed into a stream of light and flew away. Instantly, he passed through the layers of invisible blades and arrived hundreds of meters away.

“Zhou Wen, you are still too young. It’s the unknown that people fear. You shouldn’t have let those invisible sword beams circulate and let me figure out their location. The next time we meet will be your death,” Hermit said as he accelerated.

“Ah!”

Just as Hermit finished speaking, he let out a tragic cry. His face seemed to slam into an invisible blade as half his facial skin was sliced off.

As he couldn’t dodge in time, a piece of his shoulder was sliced off. Blood gushed out like a fountain.

“Keep talking,” Zhou Wen said to Hermit.

Hermit’s face was livid. He was already severely injured before Zhou Wen had really struck. His combat strength had been halved.

“Zhou Wen, don’t force me.” Hermit knew that he was in a hopeless situation when he saw that Cave Era was held back by Wei Ge and was unable to help him.

“I’ve never seen others fight to the death. I just want to see it for myself,” Zhou Wen said unhurriedly.

With the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Sword Array trapping Hermit, it was impossible for Hermit to escape. Zhou Wen wanted to know how strong the four Heavenly Kings of the League of Guardians were.

“Fine!” Hermit’s eyes turned ferocious as the Guardian armor on his body emitted a demonic glow.

Behind the armor, arm after arm formed. In the blink of an eye, a wheel made of more than a thousand arms appeared behind Hermit.

The palm on the arm was clenched. When the palm opened, one could see eyes growing in the palm. They looked extremely demonic and terrifying. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Why does this fellow’s Guardian armor look a little like the one in myths and legends… Zhou Wen looked at the thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Guardian armor and revealed a thoughtful expression.

As for Cave Era, who was fighting elsewhere, she was pleasantly surprised when she saw the changes in Hermit’s armor.?Hermit has already reached such a stage without anyone noticing. The Guardian has already completely undergone Terror transformation. He’s just one step away from advancing to the Calamity grade!

Such a Hermit gave Cave Era a sliver of hope. If Hermit could defeat Zhou Wen, their plan today wouldn’t be considered a complete failure.

As Zhou Wen was in thought, Hermit’s body emitted a strange glow that condensed into a thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Bodhisattva projection.

The figure was hundreds of meters tall and its glow illuminated a hundred kilometers. Even Luoyang City in the distance could clearly see the terrifying figure.

“What’s that?”

“The legendary thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Bodhisattva… Doesn’t that mean…”

“Then who’s fighting?”

…

Everyone discussed spiritedly. The terrifying might emitted by the thousand-handed, Thousand-Eyed Bodhisattva made one’s heart tremble.

“Should we reinforce Young Master Wen?” An Sheng couldn’t help but worry when he saw that Hermit could produce such terrifying strength.

“There’s no need,” Leng Zongzheng said indifferently as he continued sitting in the city.

Hermit muttered something as the thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Bodhisattva spoke like it was reading scriptures. It held the sky with its palms as its eyes emitted divine light.

Destruction was left in the wake of the terrifying divine light as though it wanted to destroy the world.

“Zhou Wen, go to hell!” With Hermit’s roar, the thousand hands and thousand eyes aimed at Zhou Wen. Instantly, divine light condensed as a beam that resembled a blazing sun instantly arrived in front of Zhou Wen. The dazzling light seemed to devour everything.

Boom!

While everyone was reeling in shock, they saw sword beams cascade down like a galaxy.
