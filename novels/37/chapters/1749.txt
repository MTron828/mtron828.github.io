Chapter 1750 Trajectory Girl

“Do you want to go?” Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and asked Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan.

“Yes, Coach, do you have a solution?” Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan’s eyes lit up.

“Call Qin Zhen over. I’ll be your sparring partner.” Zhou Wen felt that it was time to showcase the true effects of the Teacher Domain.

“Right away.” Ming Xiu hurriedly ran out. He knew better than anyone how rare it was to be taught by Zhou Wen. It was comparable to an immortal opportunity.

“Old Zhou, didn’t you say not to alert the enemy?” Li Xuan frowned.

“It might not be a bad thing to cause some commotion,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

Li Xuan seemed to understand something as he said in enlightenment, ‘You are trying to push them out as targets!”

“Don’t make it sound so nasty. I just want those alien races to know that humans aren’t as weak as they imagine, nor are they inseparable from their resources,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“How boring. Another alien race.” A youth switched off the livestream on his phone with flagging interest. Over the past few days, there wasn’t a single human name on the Cube’s rankings. The number of people watching the livestream decreased.

“If Human Sovereign doesn’t come, I reckon no human can enter the rankings. Compared to the alien races, humans are still a little weak.” A youth beside him found it boring as well and switched his phone off.

“I really hope Human Sovereign can come out quickly and steamroll those alien races,” the youth from before said.

“Are you guys dreaming?” A girl walked over arrogantly and said disdainfully, “Human Sovereign is only considered relatively strong among humans. He’s too ordinary when compared to the alien races. Steamroll others? It’s hard to say if he can cross the Lake of Fog.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The girl’s words immediately made the surrounding people glare at her angrily.

“Young lady, what are you talking about?” the elder beside her glared at her.

“I’m just telling the truth. Humans are weak.” The girl didn’t take the angry looks of everyone to heart as though she hadn’t seen them.

“I think you’re asking for a beating.” A burly man rushed over angrily, wanting to teach the girl a lesson.

However, just as he reached out to grab the girl’s shoulder, a hand suddenly extended from the side and grabbed his wrist. Immediately, his entire body couldn’t move.

“Friend, a gentleman speaks without resorting to force.” The owner of the hand was a handsome man. With a shake of his hand, the burly man lost his balance and retreated. He ultimately failed to get a footing as he plopped to the ground.

The expressions of the onlookers changed. The burly man was rather famous in the area. After all, he was an expert who had successfully advanced to the Mythical stage using the Mythical Serum. Yet, he was easily pushed to the ground. It was obvious how terrifying the other man’s strength was.

Although they were angry, no one dared to say anything else as they watched the girl and the man leave one after another.

“Xiao, are humans such senseless creatures?” the girl said as she walked.

“Your Highness, most humans are delusional creatures,” Xiao said with a smile.

“Is that the same for Human Sovereign?” the girl asked.

“Yes,” Xiao answered with certainty.

The girl seemed somewhat disappointed. “Aren’t there any interesting humans?”

“According to what I know, there’s an interesting human, but this person is also a delusional person,” Xiao said.

“What’s the difference?” The girl couldn’t understand Xiao’s words.

“It sometimes becomes very interesting when one is excessively delusional,” Xiao explained.

The girl asked with piqued interest, “What’s interesting?”

“Isn’t it interesting to turn delusion into reality?” Xiao said with a smile.

“That’s interesting, but is there really such a person?” The girl found it unbelievable.

“The city he’s in is nearby. Your Highness, do you want to pay a visit?” Xiao took out his phone and showed the girl a map.

“Then let’s go take a look and see if this delusional fanatic is as interesting as you say.” The girl glanced at the map on her phone before softly reciting, “Guide Ancient City…”

“He definitely won’t disappoint you, Your Highness.” Xiao’s eyes seemed to be smiling.

The two of them headed for Guide Ancient City. They didn’t seem to be walking fast, but they soon vanished.

Overseer Luoyang’s residence.

“Overseer, there’s news that the mermaid is out at sea,” An Sheng said excitedly to An Tianzuo when he arrived at the restaurant.

An Tianzuo didn’t react when he heard that. He placed the spoon to his mouth and gently blew at the porridge inside before taking it to Ya’er’s mouth. “Ya’er, be good. Have some porridge. You’re still growing. How can you not eat?”

“Uncle, I don’t want to eat it,” Ya’er said as she shook her head.

“Does it not suit your taste? What do you want to eat? I’ll make it for you myself. By the way, don’t you like the sweet soup I cook the most? I’ll cook it for you now,” An Tianzuo said dotingly as he put down the bowl and spoon.

“Uncle, I miss Brother,” Ya’er said pitifully as she looked at An Tianzuo with her large eyes.

An Tianzuo sighed softly. “Ya’er, be good. Wait a little longer. When the situation over there stabilizes, I’ll get Ah Sheng to take you to him.”

“Really, Uncle?” Ya’er immediately stood up happily.

“When has Uncle ever lied to you? Come, drink the porridge…” An Tianzuo picked up a spoonful of porridge and fed it to Ya’er.

After Ya’er finished the porridge, An Tianzuo got someone to take her to the garden to play before he and An Sheng went to the study.

“What did he say?” An Tianzuo asked with a heavy expression.

“The one from the Trajectory Holy Temple has been taken to Young Master Wen’s,” An Sheng said.

“Who got him to take her there? Didn’t I get him to bring her here?” An Tianzuo frowned.

“He said that it’s more suitable over there.” An Sheng paused before saying, “I think it’s good to go to Young Master Wen. Young Master Wen’s people aren’t that inflexible. Perhaps they can do something we can’t.”

“Are you implying that I’m inflexible?” An Tianzuo glared at An Sheng.

“No, not at all. Overseer, you are mistaken. I’m saying that Young Master Wen’s people are rather barbaric. Perhaps they suit the taste of the person from the Trajectory Holy Temple,” An Sheng hurriedly explained.

“A bunch of amateurs.” An Tianzuo snorted coldly before continuing, “Make the arrangements. If anything happens on Xiao’s side, at least there’ll be a remedy.”

“Overseer, don’t worry. Didn’t he say that although the one from the Trajectory Holy Temple is strong, she’s not one of those old freaks. Her temperament hasn’t completely matured. Furthermore, she’s suppressed on Earth. Nothing serious will happen,” An Sheng said.

An Tianzuo stared at An Sheng without saying a word. An Sheng hurriedly said, “Overseer, don’t worry. I’ll do it right away.”
