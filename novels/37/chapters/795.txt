Chapter 796: Strange Girl

Translator: CKtalon

The girl kept looking at Zhou Wen, but she didn’t shout or scream. Neither did she look flustered.

This left Zhou Wen in a dilemma. If the girl had shown a hostile stance or screamed, he would have long taken action to put her down.

However, with her looking at him without making a fuss, it wasn’t appropriate for Zhou Wen to attack.

There are so many people in the Xiao family that the girl might not recognize all of them. Could it be that she doesn’t know that I’m not from the Xiao family? After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that it was very likely. Otherwise, there was no reason for the girl not to call for help.

If he were someone who had a glib tongue, he might be able to fool the girl and get some information from her.

Unfortunately, Zhou Wen wasn’t eloquent, so he only gave the girl a friendly smile. He pretended to be strolling around and wanted to leave the yard.

Zhou Wen took a few steps to the side, hoping to circle around the girl, but she took two steps to block his path. Clearly, she wasn’t willing to let him go.

“Ahem, sorry. I got lost. Sorry for disturbing you,” Zhou Wen said as he took a few steps to the other side, hoping to circle around the girl.

The girl blocked his path again, but she had no intention of attacking. She didn’t seem to have any intention of shouting.

“Why are you stopping me? Is there anything I can help you with?” Zhou Wen planned on trying to convince the girl with his bad eloquence.

The girl remained silent as she continued looking at him, sizing him up.

Is the Xiao family that odd? Zhou Wen found the girl odd.

Ignoring the fact that her actions were incomprehensible, Zhou Wen hadn’t seen her when he entered the yard. With Truth Listener’s ability, it was impossible for Zhou Wen not to notice that there was someone in the yard.

However, when the girl stood behind him, Zhou Wen really couldn’t work out where she had come from.

Could it be that this girl isn’t human but a ghost? Zhou Wen carefully sized up the girl, but he didn’t discover anything wrong with her. She looked like a normal human girl.

The girl remained silent. Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he realized that someone was walking towards the yard. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Zhou Wen looked into the yard. Apart from the temple hall, there were no other obstructions.

After glancing at the girl, Zhou Wen gestured for her to remain silent before heading deeper into the temple hall.

The girl being able to see him didn’t mean that others could see him. Zhou Wen planned on hiding and giving it a try. Since he had already been exposed, the situation couldn’t be any worse.

There was an offering table in the temple hall without any additional decorations. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about where to hide, he saw the girl walk in.

With the girl following Zhou Wen, even if others couldn’t see the invisible Zhou Wen, they would discover his existence because of her.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to take action and put the girl down, he saw her point at a cloth curtain in the corner of the temple hall, indicating for him to hide behind it.

The two people had already arrived at the yard’s entrance. Zhou Wen didn’t dare say another word, afraid that they would hear him. All he could do was look at the girl and point at himself before pointing at the curtain.

The girl seemed to understand what he meant and nodded.

Zhou Wen tiptoed to the back of the curtain.

Just as Zhou Wen steadied himself, he heard the door to the yard open. The two people walked in and quickly entered the temple hall.

Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of being discovered. If he was discovered, he could just storm his way out. However, that would mean a failure to obtain any information.

The two of them walked into the room and didn’t pay attention to the back of the curtain. Clearly, they hadn’t expected someone to be hiding here. Furthermore, Zhou Wen was invisible. It was difficult to discover him with the naked eye.

However, what puzzled Zhou Wen was that they ignored the girl as though she wasn’t there.

The two people who entered the temple hall were no longer young. They were probably at least fifty years old.

After entering the temple hall, one of the men placed something on the offering table. It was a small metal furnace with many tiny holes on it. Wisps of smoke emitted from the tiny holes.

The smoke didn’t rise vertically. It seemed to be attracted by some force and floated towards the Kuman Thong on the offering table.

The man bowed to the Kuman Thong before walking to the side.

“Liuqi, have you investigated the matter regarding Si’er?” the man who had placed the incense asked.

“According to the intelligence sent by the spies in the Imperial Capital, Xiao Si went to the Great Wall with Wang Chan. There was likely another person with them. This person has a good relationship with Wang Chan, so we haven’t found out who it is yet,” Xiao Liuqi answered.

“In your opinion, could it be that the Wang family discovered our goal and deliberately eliminated Si’er?” Xiao Tianfang said with a frown.

“From the looks of it, it shouldn’t be. If the Wang family really discovered our goal, they definitely wouldn’t only target Xiao Si alone. They also wouldn’t give us any explanation about Xiao Si and might have even severed relations with our Xiao family. But there aren’t any signs of that,” Xiao Liuqi said.

Xiao Tianfang sighed and said, “The Wang family is a family clan in the East District after all. Even if they are stronger than our Xiao family, it won’t be easy for them to come to the South District to touch our Xiao family. I’m not afraid that they will fall out with us. Unfortunately, with Si’er’s death, I’m afraid our plan won’t have a chance.”

“Tianfang, is there nothing else that can replace Wang Chan’s Life Providence?” Xiao Liuqi asked.

“If there was a replacement, we wouldn’t have taken such a huge risk to target the Wang family.” Xiao Tianfang explained, “We’ve studied the Gu Lady Kuman Nee for so many years. Although she successfully advanced to the Mythical level, she still can’t be controlled freely. In recent years, our control over her has become weaker and weaker. Refining her into a Life Soul is even more impossible.”

“Now that she’s already at the Mythical level, it’s impossible to refine her into a Life Soul. However, using Wang Chan’s Goddess of Misfortune Life Providence, we can create a Misfortune Kuman Nee and let her suppress and influence the Gu Lady Kuman Nee. This way, we can take the opportunity to firmly grasp them both,” Xiao Tianfang said.

“Can a Heaven Baby replace the Misfortune Kuman Nee?” Xiao Liuqi asked.

“It’s not that simple. Gu Lady Kuman Nee is the reincarnation of a Gu God. Before she was born, we forcefully refined her into a Kuman Nee. Although she’s not a real god, she’s not something an ordinary Kuman Thong can compare to. Only some especially powerful Kuman Thong can influence her. Currently, the best chance we have is to refine Wang Chan into a Misfortune Kuman Nee. The other methods are even more difficult and impossible to realize,” Xiao Tianfang said.
