Chapter 990: Terror versus Terror

Translator: CKtalon

Night Thearch looked down at his chest and saw blood slowly flowing along the ice-blue dragon teeth.

“Ice Dragon King’s Tooth...” Night Thearch’s face instantly turned extremely pale.

Zhou Wen released the dragon tooth. His palm that held the dragon tooth had already frozen. If he continued holding it, his palm and armor would probably be frozen to pieces.

“Didn’t you say that only a Terror-grade can injure a Terror-grade? As you wish.” Zhou Wen pulled out an ice dragon rib with his left hand and slashed at Night Thearch again.

Zhou Wen also wanted to use Doctor Darkness’s Darkness Right Hand with his right hand again, but his right hand was already numb from the cold. He couldn’t raise it at all.

The power of a Terror-grade was too terrifying. Just holding the dragon tooth for an attack was already unbearable for his palm, so he could only switch to his left hand.

Although his left hand wasn’t as good as Darkness Right Hand, it was augmented by Doctor Darkness’s Golden Left Hand. His Speed and Strength were much stronger.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen’s strike was using the Immortal Slaying thanks to Slaughterer. It was unbelievably fast. With a flash, he crossed paths with Night Thearch.

As he switched his Life Soul, the sun-like light vanished, revealing Zhou Wen’s true appearance. As for Night Thearch’s arm, it had been sliced off by Zhou Wen. However, Night Thearch vanished like a phantom without a trace, leaving only an arm and the dragon tooth that had stabbed into his chest.

He actually managed to escape?

Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed, but he didn’t chase after him. His left hand was already suffering from frostbite, so it was impossible for him to use the ice dragon’s parts with his hands.

Furthermore, after dealing Immortal Slaying, he had expended all his strength. He might not be able to gain an advantage even if he succeeded in chasing after him.

The people from Sea Return City didn’t know Zhou Wen’s present situation. Seeing him easily injure the god-like Night Thearch and even sever one of his arms, they looked at him with reverent eyes.

“Let them retreat to the sea,” Zhou Wen said to the Seven Seas Dragon King.

Although the Seven Seas Dragon King’s consciousness hadn’t been completely parasitized, its resistance suddenly weakened after Night Thearch escaped. Primordial Spore had the upper hand.

It was still difficult to destroy the Seven Seas Dragon King’s consciousness, but some simple control was enough.

With Zhou Wen’s order, the seven strange dragon-like tentacles of the Seven Seas Dragon King roared at the sky. The mutated marine dimensional creatures retreated into the Seven Dragons Sea like the tide.

Seeing a powerful dimensional creature like the Seven Seas Dragon King listen to Zhou Wen’s orders, everyone’s expressions turned even odder. They found it unbelievable that he was only a human youth.

In particular, many people from the Hui and Feng families recognized Zhou Wen. They knew that he was Hui Haifeng and Feng Qiuyan’s classmate, so their expressions were even stranger.

Back when Feng Qiuyan mentioned Zhou Wen to his family elders, he even said that Zhou Wen had taught him many things. Back then, the Feng family thought nothing of it.

Now, from their point of view, Feng Qiuyan was extremely lucky to be able to learn from Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was afraid that Night Thearch would return to the underwater palace to cause trouble for Miya and company, so he landed on the Seven Seas Dragon King’s head and spoke to Li Xuan and Hui Haifeng. “I’m heading to the underwater abyss to take a look. Do you want to come with me?”

“We’ll go with you.” Li Xuan chased after him with Ya’er in his arms. Hui Haifeng also boarded the Seven Seas Dragon King.

The Seven Seas Dragon King reluctantly headed for the sea and quickly vanished in the raging waves.

“Old Master Hui, are we still leaving Sea Return City?” Family Head Liu walked to Old Master Hui and asked.

The others also looked at Old Master Hui eagerly. Although they usually let Old Master Hui take the lead, they were clearly more respectful now.

Old Master Hui knew very well that the reason they were so reverent wasn’t because he was the head of the Hui family, but because of Hui Haifeng and Zhou Wen.

Although he didn’t know if Zhou Wen had called Hui Haifeng along on purpose or not, it had undoubtedly helped the Hui family greatly. In the future, it would be much more convenient for the Hui family to handle matters in Sea Return City, especially matters related to Hui Haifeng.

As for Hui Haifeng’s previous research results, everyone saw its potential and possibilities. They no longer dared to underestimate him. If not for Hui Haifeng’s gold powder, they would have long been infected. They wouldn’t have had the chance to wait for Zhou Wen’s appearance.

The Feng family was also secretly doing the math. Zhou Wen’s relationship with Feng Qiuyan wasn’t any weaker than his relationship with Hui Haifeng. They felt like they could do something.

“There’s no need to leave for the time being, but the situation is unpredictable. Everyone should return and pack up. Leave and think of backup plans for the family,” Old Master Hui said ambiguously.

Many people strongly agreed with his words. They were in a rush to escape. Previously, they hadn’t been able to take their possessions with them. Now, they could return to take them. They had to slowly transfer the family assets away. Even if they could stay in Sea Return, they couldn’t treat this place as their foundation.

Before Zhou Wen and company arrived at the underwater abyss, they saw Miya return with Qin Ling and Feng Qiuyan. They were fine, having only been imprisoned in the palace by Night Thearch.

Miya had finally broken through the power that sealed them and saved them.

“Night Thearch is a strange person. He can be considered vicious for trivializing the murder of billions of people, but he didn’t kill us despite having so many chances,” Li Xuan said.

“It’s true that we can’t treat him as simply a bad person, but sometimes, such people are even more terrifying than bad people.” Zhou Wen paused before saying, “We still have to think of a way to resolve Qin Ling’s problem. Otherwise, Night Thearch will eventually make a comeback.”

“If I’m not wrong, the source of those marine mutated creatures should be her, right?” Hui Haifeng said as he sized up Qin Ling.

Qin Ling nodded slightly. “I’m sorry for implicating everyone.”

“There’s no need to say that. You’re not at fault. The one at fault is this era.” Hui Haifeng thought for a moment and said, “If you believe me, you must give me some time. With my research, I might be able to resolve the problem with you and stop Night Thearch from seeking you out again.”

Qin Ling looked at Hui Haifeng in puzzlement before looking at Feng Qiuyan and Miya.

“Senior Hui has done a lot of research on biological mutations. Let him give it a try. Perhaps he really can succeed. Even if he can’t, things can’t get any worse,” Li Xuan said.

Li Xuan still trusted in Hui Haifeng’s character.

“If you trust us, you can let Senior give it a try,” Zhou Wen added.

When Qin Ling saw Feng Qiuyan and Miya nod slightly, she bowed at Hui Haifeng. “I really don’t know how to repay you.”

“If it really succeeds, taking good care of our Junior Feng will be considered the best payment,” Hui Haifeng said with a smile.

Zhou Wen knew that Hui Haifeng had the confidence for him to say that, but he didn’t know what he was going to do. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Zhou Wen didn’t know much about this, so he couldn’t help much. All he wanted to do was head to Night Thearch’s abyssal palace to see if there was anything there.

After finding so many ice dragon objects, there might be something similar in the deep-sea palace.
