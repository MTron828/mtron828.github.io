Chapter 935: Demon God Body

The ice maiden laughed happily. This was the first time she had met a human like Zhou Wen.

Wang Mingyuan was indeed powerful. No one would deny the strength of a human who could defeat the Dragon King. They would also give him the corresponding respect.

However, that was under the condition that Wang Mingyuan had the ability to earn the prestige. Furthermore, Wang Mingyuan had fused with a Guardian, so he was no longer considered a human.

After fusing with the Guardian, his body no longer had any human shackles. In essence, Wang Mingyuan was already considered a part of the dimension zone and not a human from Earth. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Zhou Wen was a pure Earth human who wasn’t even at the Mythical stage, yet he dared to say such words. The ice maiden found it very funny.

“Are all the humans on Earth as ignorant and laughable as you?” the ice maiden asked Zhou Wen.

“I don’t find it funny,” Zhou Wen said solemnly.

“Then you must be crazy. A human at the Epic stage who doesn’t even have the right to live in the dimension dares to be mentioned in the same breath as the Dragon King. You even claim that you have surpassed him. I’m afraid you don’t know what kind of existence a Calamity-grade existence like the Dragon King is.”

The ice maiden paused for a moment before continuing, “That’s right. It’s impossible for you to have a chance to see a Calamity-grade existence on Earth. On Earth, the Terror grade is already an unparalleled existence. If a Calamity grade comes close to Earth, even if it’s just an unconscious contact without any hostility, it will cause an unimaginable disaster to Earth. The ignorant are fearless. Your arrogance is understandable.”

With that said, the ice maiden ignored Zhou Wen and transformed into her Terror form. She walked to the bell, picked it up, and shook it.

Zhou Wen felt the ice castle shake again before using Truth Listener to look outside. He realized that it wasn’t an ocean outside the ice castle, but he wasn’t back at the volcanic area. Outside, there was an endless grassland. He could see many dimensional creatures with human torsos but the lower body and legs of horses. Some dimensional creatures were even stranger.

After putting down the bell, the ice maiden slowly turned around and looked at Zhou Wen expressionlessly. “Your jokes are very funny, but I’m not interested in them. Hand over the fox core now and I can send you to the Dragon Gods. Otherwise, even if Wang Mingyuan is really your teacher, you will definitely die today.”

“I haven’t died before. I want to give it a try,” Zhou Wen said.

“Very well.” The ice maiden’s gaze turned cold as her body emitted an ice beam. In an instant, the entire ice castle was enveloped by a terrifying cold aura. The interior space was filled, sealing off all possibilities.

The power of the Terror grade was indeed not something ordinary Mythical creatures could compare with.

Almost at the same time the ice maiden attacked, Zhou Wen’s body underwent a change. The speed at which he changed exceeded one’s imagination. As the ice castle was sealed, Zhou Wen turned into a blue scallop.

This was the ability that the Eyes of Legacy had given Zhou Wen after it advanced to a Perfect Body.

Demon God Body (Perfect Body): A carrier of the demons’ bloodline. A catalog of the myriad races.

In the past, the Eyes of Legacy could only scan and transform. Once it switched to other Essence Energy Arts, the transformation would be gone. If he wanted to continue transforming, he could only scan again.

However, the present Demon God Body didn’t need to go through that trouble. As long as Zhou Wen had scanned and transformed into the dimensional creature previously, he would be able to store the memory into the Demon God Body like a picture. He could directly transform when he wanted to use it without spending a lot of time and Essence Energy scanning.

Furthermore, the Essence Energy expenditure needed to transform was further reduced as a Perfect Body Life Soul. With Zhou Wen’s current Essence Energy, he could support transforming into a Mythical creature.

Mutated Demon Mother Clam? The ice maiden’s expression changed when she saw the blue crystalline shell that Zhou Wen had transformed into.

Her ice beam shone on the blue crystalline shell, but it failed to freeze it. There seemed to be a blue vortex inside the blue shell. When the ice beam shone on it, it was immediately sucked in.

Zhou Wen was in a very good mood. After his Life Soul advanced to the Demon God Body, he completed the scan of the Mutated Demon Mother Clam and turned into it.

He finally understood why the snake monster had been unwilling to attack the Mutated Demon Mother Clam. It was because it was like a demon’s recycling station.

It could devour all forms of energy released by demons and convert it into its own energy. Even the power of the Terror grade would be absorbed when it struck the Mutated Demon Mother Clam.

Of course, this power was only effective against demons. Devouring the energy of other species would instead cause adverse effects to the Mutated Demon Mother Clam.

It was a Mythical creature with obvious strengths and weaknesses. Almost no demon could harm it. However, against creatures other than demons, its combat strength wasn’t that strong.

This was a typical creature that specialized in disciplining its own kind during any internal strife.

After Zhou Wen figured out the Mutated Demon Mother Clam’s abilities, he was immediately overjoyed. Without a doubt, the ice maiden was also a demon. Her Terror-grade strength would only be converted into energy and unable to harm Zhou Wen who had transformed into the Mutated Demon Mother Clam.

Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy couldn’t sustain the Mythical creature transformation for long. However, due to the Mutated Demon Mother Clam’s ability to absorb energy and convert it for its own usage, he could keep up the transformation for a long period of time after absorbing the ice maiden’s ice beam.

Zhou Wen had deliberately infuriated the ice maiden because he wanted her to attack him so that he could absorb her energy and keep the Mutated Demon Mother Clam transformation for a longer period of time.

It’s no wonder there’s only one Mutated Demon Mother Clam in the spring. It’s probably a unique Mythical creature, Zhou Wen thought.

The ice maiden clearly knew the Mutated Demon Mother Clam’s ability as she looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.

The ice maiden didn’t think much of Zhou Wen’s ability to transform into low-level demons. There were many demons who were good at transforming.

However, Zhou Wen was at the Epic stage, yet he could transform into a creature like the Mutated Demon Mother Clam. Furthermore, he had the same ability as the Mutated Demon Mother Clam. This was unbelievable.

This was because most of the transformations only changed one’s physique and couldn’t truly transform into that creature.

Even if one could completely transform into another creature, they could only go from a higher level to a lower level.

For example, a Terror-grade demon who was good at transforming could completely transform his body into a Mythical creature, but it was very difficult for him to turn into a Terror, much less a higher-level Calamity.

This was because the level of energy available ensured that it was impossible to go from a lower lifeform to a higher lifeform.

However, this wasn’t absolute. Among the demons, there was indeed an Essence Energy Art that could turn living creatures from a lower lifeform to a higher lifeform. It was the legendary Demon God Catalog. Legend had it that it was the Essence Energy Art progenitor of all demons.
