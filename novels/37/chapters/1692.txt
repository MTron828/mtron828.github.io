Chapter 1693: Karoman

“Professor Gu, what do you think of the recent rankings?” Su Yi tried her best to host the program. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Although there had been a storm on the Cube’s rankings recently, with experts constantly appearing while the rankings constantly changed, the program’s ratings were very good. However, Su Yi just couldn’t lift her spirits.

Professor Gu answered, “At present, those who can enter the top ten of the Cube’s rankings are experts who can clear the fifth Star Palace. Only the Sun race’s representative, Karoman, who’s ranked first, has cleared the sixth Star Palace. He’s considered unique. However, according to my research, there should be three to four people in the top ten who have a high chance of clearing the sixth Star Palace.”

“Who are they?” Su Yi asked.

“I’ll give an example first. For example, the representative of the Fallen race, Mohe. His strength shouldn’t be inferior to Karoman. It’s only a matter of time before he can clear the sixth Star Palace. The others also have similar strength. It’s just that even if they can clear the sixth Star Palace, they might not be able to surpass Karoman on the rankings, so they didn’t take action,” Professor Gu analyzed.

As the host, Su Yi’s reaction was still very fast. She continued in line with Professor Gu’s words and asked, “Then, Professor Gu, who do you think will be the first to clear the seventh Star Palace?”

“That’s hard to say. According to the results of Karoman’s previous attempt, the stone steps in front of Alkaid Star Palace can eliminate Essence Energy. He gave up before he finished walking the stone steps. From this, one can roughly determine that after reaching the end, one’s Essence Energy might be completely drained. With such characteristics, no matter how powerful a powerhouse is, they will be crippled when they reach the Star Palace. Unless one has a way to retain Essence Energy, no one has a chance of clearing the seventh Star Palace.”

Professor Gu paused for a moment before continuing, “As for who has such an ability, it’s still unknown for the time being. However, there’s one thing that’s certain. It’s difficult to avoid having one’s Essence Energy drained. Therefore, although he’s ranked higher, he has the least chance among them.”

The comments were discussing who would be the first to clear the seventh Star Palace. There were all kinds of comments, but the topic of discussion was basically on the top few.

Just as the discussion was getting heated, they suddenly saw the Cube’s screen light up. A figure appeared on the screen. It was none other than Karoman.

“Karoman?” Su Yi was stunned when she saw Karoman. Professor Gu’s expression turned odd.

“Karoman is already ranked first. There’s no need for him to challenge the Big Dipper Palaces again unless he wants to challenge the seventh Star Palace…” Su Yi’s eyes lit up.

“Professor Gu is mighty. As expected of his jinxed mouth.”

“Sect Master Gu will unite the world for ages.”

“I’m willing to call the Sect Master Gu the strongest in the universe.”

The comments were all expressing their amazement of Sect Master Gu. Professor Gu had just said that it was impossible for him to clear the seventh Star Palace, and here he was challenging it. Furthermore, he was clearly here for the seventh Star Palace. Everyone felt that Professor Gu was truly amazing.

The golden-armored Karoman arrived in front of the first Star Palace. Sun God Light bloomed from his body as though he was a divine son blessed by the Sun God.

With every step he took, the golden Sun God Light on his body was dazzling, making his handsome face appear even more holy.

When Starlord Ravenous Wolf saw Karoman walk in, he immediately blasted out a blast of light. Karoman also threw a punch. The sun-like golden divine light collided with Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s blast of light.

The terrifying dazzling light made it impossible for anyone other than a very small number of experts to see what was happening on the screen. The experts knew that Karoman and Starlord Ravenous Wolf had exchanged countless punches at that instant. Their speed had already reached the speed of light, so ordinary people couldn’t see their actions.

As for the broadcast, it was completely dazzling. Soon, when the dazzling light vanished, Starlord Ravenous Wolf had already been killed by Karoman. Many crystals dropped on the ground.

“He’s so powerful. He killed Starlord Ravenous Wolf in one punch.” The average person only saw Karoman deliver a punch and thought that he had instantly killed Starlord Ravenous Wolf with one punch.

“No matter how many times I look at it, it’s always so pleasing to the eye. Karoman is just so perfect. He doesn’t look like a human at all. He’s like the Sun God Apollo.”

Everyone marveled at Karoman’s strength, feeling envious. Many people wondered when they would be lucky enough to be chosen by the dimensional races to become a powerful existence like Karoman.

Karoman cleared one Star Palace after another. The Starlords who looked extremely powerful in the eyes of ordinary people were easily killed by Karoman. It only took a few seconds.

However, ordinary people couldn’t see that Karoman had actually used many techniques. The reason he could kill the Starlords so quickly was mainly because he had already understood their abilities and used targeted tactics.

Even so, it was rather shocking.

“Although I’ve already seen it once, I have to admit that Karoman is extremely powerful. He does resemble Human Sovereign’s former glory,” Su Yi said with a sigh.

Unexpectedly, Su Yi’s exclamation triggered a collective criticism on the screen.

“Although you are my goddess, there’s no way to compare Human Sovereign and Karoman now, right? It’s impossible for pure humans to advance to the Calamity grade, right?”

“Sis, isn’t Human Sovereign old news from years ago? The new generation replaces and surpasses the old. Human Sovereign has long been smacked to death on the beach.”

“Although I’m unwilling to admit it, I have to say that the strength of the representatives who obtained the resources of the dimensional races has increased too quickly. Unless Human Sovereign has become a representative, there’s nothing to compare.”

“With Human Sovereign’s temperament, he probably won’t bow down to the dimensional races. It’s unlikely he will become a representative.”

“It would be sad if Human Sovereign becomes a representative.”

“What’s there to be sad about? What era are we in now? Everything depends on strength. It’s sad if you don’t have strength.”

Amidst everyone’s discussion, Karoman had already cleared the sixth Star Palace and arrived at the long staircase of the seventh Star Palace.

Everyone immediately fell silent as they held their breaths and watched the screen. The last time, Karoman had given up midway. Thankfully, there was still a chance of giving up before entering the Star Palace’s entrance. If he entered the Star Palace, he wouldn’t even have the chance to give up.

Under the attention of everyone, Karoman stepped onto the flight of stairs and walked towards the Star Palace’s door.

Everyone counted the number of steps Karoman took in their hearts. When he reached the spot he had given up the last time, he didn’t give up as before. Instead, he continued walking.

When he reached the end of the stone steps, even Su Yi couldn’t help but raise her voice and shout, “Karoman has walked all the way up!”
