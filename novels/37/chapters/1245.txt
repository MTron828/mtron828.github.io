Chapter 1246: Moon Goddess?

Zhou Wen hurriedly took out his phone and opened a mainstream livestream app. Soon, he saw the scene of the Cube.

Zhou Wen was stunned the moment he saw it.

The creature in the scene was dressed in a white muslin robe. On the scorching Venus, the sleeves fluttered slightly. Its body emitted a faint luster, making one feel cool and peaceful for some reason.

Tsukuyomi! Although ordinary people couldn’t discern Tsukuyomi’s true appearance due to the veil that covered her face and the light that blurred her figure, Zhou Wen still recognized her at a glance.

Tsukuyomi’s temperament was unique. After spending a long time with her, it was easy to recognize her.

Is Tsukuyomi really going in? Zhou Wen sighed. He finally understood why Tsukuyomi was unwilling to leave Earth.

However, Tsukuyomi had rejected his help in the end and had chosen to leave Earth. This puzzled Zhou Wen.

Tsukuyomi landed on the platform of the hemispherical metal building. She didn’t drip her blood onto the platform. Instead, she took a step and arrived inside the room.

“Is this a fairy from myths? She’s so beautiful!”

“She can’t be a human, right? I can’t tell if she’s a dimensional creature.”

“It’s too blurry. I can’t see clearly. Perhaps her face is extremely ugly.”

“With that figure and temperament, she can’t be ugly.”

Everyone discussed spiritedly. The focus was actually Tsukuyomi’s looks.

Tsukuyomi’s clothes fluttered as she floated in the room. The Metal Guard’s bullets immediately shot over.

Tsukuyomi slowly landed on the ground and ignored the bullets. However, the bullets gradually vanished as they flew, like snowflakes melting in the sunlight.

What was even more terrifying was that it wasn’t just the bullets. Even the Metal Guard’s body was slowly disappearing.

In the blink of an eye, the Metal Guard had vanished like the bullet.

The six doors opened at the same time. Groups of Metal Guards rushed out of the six doors and kept firing at Tsukuyomi.

When the rain of bullets flew towards her, they strangely vanished again. The Metal Guards’ bodies were the same. In just a while, more than a hundred Metal Guards vanished one by one, leaving nothing on the ground.

There were no dimensional crystals or Companion Eggs. The room was spotless.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The spectating humans didn’t dare say a word. Ever since the live broadcast of the Cube, everyone’s horizons had gradually broadened. They had also seen many powerful creatures.

An existence as powerful as the Dragon Turtle still needed to reflect the enemy’s attack, but this was the first time they had seen an existence standing there without moving.

What humans were most afraid of wasn’t the terrifying power they could see, but the fear of the unknown. They couldn’t understand how Tsukuyomi had killed the Metal Guards, so the fear in their hearts would subconsciously multiply.

“Professor Gu, what do you think of this new mysterious creature? Who do you think is stronger when compared to the Dragon Turtle?” The host of the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau interviewed an old professor for his opinion.

Professor Gu was a permanent guest on the Cube’s live broadcast. He was quite powerful and was knowledgeable. His previous analyses were accurate and the audience thought highly of him.

Professor Gu thought for a moment and said, “The Dragon Turtle’s level in East District mythology is rather high. It’s very difficult for ordinary dimensional creatures to compare with it.”

“Professor Gu, do you think that this mysterious woman’s ability is inferior to the Dragon Turtle?” The host wanted to further confirm what Professor Gu meant.

To his surprise, Professor Gu shook his head and said, “On the contrary, I think this mysterious woman is stronger.”

The host asked in puzzlement, “Professor Gu, I don’t quite understand. You just said that Dragon Turtle has a rather high status in East District mythology, but now, you are saying that the mysterious woman is stronger than Dragon Turtle. Could it be that you have already recognized the mysterious woman’s origins? Is her level in mythology above Dragon Turtle?”

Professor Gu said, “You could say that. According to my judgment, this mysterious woman might be a famous figure in the myths and legends of the East District. She’s the kind that everyone knows.”

“I’m just too curious. I believe the viewers are also very curious. Professor Gu, can you announce the answer now?” the host said.

“Of course. If my judgment is correct, this mysterious woman might very well be the one on the moon in myths and legends,” Professor Gu said with certainty.

“Ah… Could it be that… that mysterious woman is the legendary fairy, Chang’e…” the host said in surprise.

It wasn’t just the host. Many spectators in the East District were already excited when they heard Professor Gu.

“Holy sh*t, with that figure and aura, it’s really possible.”

“No way, even Fairy Chang’e has appeared!”

“If it’s really Fairy Chang’e, I’d rather live an hour less just to see her true appearance.”

…

Fairy Chang’e was just too famous in the East District. The audience’s enthusiasm was instantly ignited.

Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry when he heard that. He was a man who had seen the real Chang’e. He wondered what they would think if they saw the real Chang’e.

Although Professor Gu wasn’t right about Tsukuyomi’s identity, his train of thought was correct. He had only guessed the wrong pantheon.

As people were discussing, the Golden Battle God Mark I had already rushed out and shot at Tsukuyomi.

Unfortunately, his bullets didn’t have a better effect than the Metal Guard’s bullets. They gradually vanished as he flew.

The Golden Battle God shot a few more times, but the outcome was the same. Not only did the bullets disappear, but even the Golden Battle God’s body vanished.

The next Golden Battle Gods that appeared were basically the same. Tsukuyomi just stood there without doing anything. The Golden Battle Gods vanished one after another.

“She’s too amazing. As expected of the moon goddess,” an uncultured man shouted at the top of his lungs.

“Is Fairy Chang’e that strong? I don’t think she’s that strong in myths and legends, right?”

“From the myths of the East District, although Chang’e is very famous, her status is far inferior to Dragon Turtle.

“Isn’t it too arbitrary to say that she’s Chang’e now? Even if she’s really Chang’e, I don’t think she’s stronger than the Dragon Turtle.”

The women were more rational. Most of them insisted that the Dragon Turtle was stronger.

When the host saw that many people were doubting Professor Gu, he continued asking, “Professor Gu, many people in the audience believe that the Dragon Turtle’s status in mythology is higher than Chang’e’s. What do you think?”

Professor Gu nodded and said, “Just from its mythological status and contributions, the Dragon Turtle is indeed higher. However, you can’t just look at one aspect…”

While Professor Gu was explaining, the alarms at the six doors had already sounded. The sound drowned Professor Gu’s voice, so he had no choice but to stop explaining.

In fact, no one was listening to his explanation. Everyone wanted to know if this fairy-like figure from the Moon Palace could withstand the fatal seventh strike.

Of course, there were also people who suspected that Tsukuyomi might not even be able to withstand the first shot.

Bang!

Only after a gunshot did the humans realize that the creature behind the door had shot its first bullet.
