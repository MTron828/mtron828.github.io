Chapter 559 Peerless Duo

When the terrifying sword intent reached its peak, it suddenly retracted. In an instant, it completely converged, and the transparent sword beam in Ming Xiu’s hand stabbed out.

This wasn’t a late strike, but a strike from the future. Ming Xiu’s sword was unbelievably fast as though it had broken through his limits. It transcended space and time as it stabbed at Zhou Wen.

The eruption of this strike was so sudden, fast, and bizarre that Tian Zhenzhen was unable to keep up with it. She did not even see how the strike was thrust out when she heard a clang.

The practice sword in Zhou Wen’s hand had already snapped. As for the transparent beam sword in Ming Xiu’s hand, it had been sheathed at some point in time.

“Tomorrow after tomorrow. How many tomorrows would there be? If you have the will, why wait until tomorrow? Live in the moment, and let the Sword of Tomorrow slay all grudges. Good sword technique!” Wei Ge praised.

Tian Zhenzhen only knew that Ming Xiu’s strike was very powerful, but she did not know how strong it was or which aspect of it was strong. She kept staring, but she couldn’t tell.

“Thank you for your guidance, Coach. I’ll be leaving.” Ming Xiu bowed seriously and then turned to leave the practice room.

“Ming Xiu, you have finally won. Furthermore, you have condensed a Life Soul. You are only seventeen years old. It’s great that you reached the Epic stage at seventeen,” Tian Zhenzhen chased after him and said excitedly.

“No, I lost.” Ming Xiu shook his head.

“How can that be? I saw you snap Zhou Wen’s sword. You definitely won!” Tian Zhenzhen exclaimed.

“That’s because Coach used a practice sword, while mine was a Life Soul Sword. That’s why he blocked my sword. It was only because the practice sword was too weak that it snapped. Even so, my sword still failed to injure him, nor was it able to force him to attack. Indeed, I’m still too inferior. However, I now have a direction. There will come a day when I will catch up with Coach,” Ming Xiu said confidently.

“I see. However, you are already very powerful. You are at the Epic stage at 17 years old. If your father knew, he would definitely be overjoyed,” Tian Zhenzhen consoled.

“That’s right. It’s time to go back and make the old man happy. I have to let others decide if the sword art my father passed down is weak or strong.” Ming Xiu’s eyes were filled with excitement. After all, he was only a seventeen-year-old. He had the zeal of youth.

After Ming Xiu and Tian Zhenzhen left, Zhou Wen was about to leave when Wei Ge stopped him.

“Zhou Wen, can we have a chat?” Wei Ge asked.

“President, what’s the matter?” Zhou Wen didn’t feel anything special about Wei Ge. He didn’t have any negative feelings towards him or a good impression of him. He was just a schoolmate he wasn’t familiar with.

“I have a question for you,” Wei Ge said.

“Just say whatever you have to say. However, I might not necessarily answer you,” Zhou Wen said.

Wei Ge smiled and said, “Actually, it’s not a big deal. I just want to ask you. After graduating, do you plan on staying in school or going out to make a name of yourself?”

“Everyone’s choices are different. I only wish to return to my hometown to game,” Zhou Wen said.

When Wei Ge heard Zhou Wen’s answer, he was stunned for a long while before he suddenly laughed. “Not bad, not bad. Everyone’s choices are different. I was overthinking it.”

“Zhou Wen, what game are you playing? I should have a lot of free time in the future. I want to play it too,” Wei Ge asked.

“Recently, Huang Ji and I have worked together to develop a new game. If you’re interested, you can download it to play. This is the download address.” Zhou Wen sent the download address of the game, Dimensional, to Wei Ge.

“Alright, I’ll go back and play.” Wei Ge downloaded the game and waved goodbye to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen went to the supermarket to buy what he needed before storing them in the chaos space. Then, he informed Li Xuan and company before leaving the school. He headed to Zhuolu alone.

He didn’t contact An Sheng. Firstly, An Sheng was still hatching the Companion Egg. Secondly, if he contacted An Sheng, he would definitely enter the temple with him. It would be a meaningless risk.

Zhou Wen already had the confidence to kill Torch Dragon, so it was better for him to do it himself.

Before he left the city, his phone suddenly rang. He took a look at the number and realized that it was from Ouyang Lan. He could not help but mutter inwardly, Don’t tell me Ouyang Lan found out so quickly?

“Little Wen, how’s your exchange with your schoolmates at the moment?” Ouyang Lan asked out of the blue after he picked up the call.

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen was puzzled and didn’t understand what Ouyang Lan was getting at.

“I’m talking about the exchange student from Bright Prospects College. Aren’t you his student tutor? How are you two getting along? Are you close?” Ouyang Lan asked.

Zhou Wen was even more puzzled. Why would Ouyang Lan actually care about this?

He had no idea that Ouyang Lan had arranged for him to become Ming Xiu’s student tutor.

“Our relationship isn’t bad, I suppose?” Zhou Wen felt that their relationship wasn’t bad. At the very least, they hadn’t quarreled.

“That’s good. What do you think if I let you live with Ming Xiu in the future?” Ouyang Lan asked again.

“Wait, Sis Lan, what do you mean? What do you mean by letting me live with Ming Xiu?” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.

Ouyang Lan said, “Do you know what Ming Xiu’s Life Providence is?”

“I don’t know.” Zhou Wen had never cared about this.

“Didn’t you say that you have a good relationship with him? Why don’t you even know about his Life Providence?” Ouyang Lan didn’t wait for Zhou Wen to reply before continuing, “His Life Providence is Peerless Duo. Do you know what it means? It means that there will be two peerless geniuses in the same era.”

“And then?” Zhou Wen still didn’t understand what this had to do with him. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Little Wen, I think that you should read more brain-teasers in addition to your cultivation to strengthen your imagination. That’s a Peerless Duo. Of course, it requires two people to be able to be called a duo. In other words, those who practice with him will be augmented by his Life Providence. Both parties will have their cultivation speed accelerate. Don’t you think that you’ve improved faster in the past three months?” Ouyang Lan said.

“There’s actually such a thing...” Zhou Wen really wasn’t aware. Furthermore, he had never cultivated with Ming Xiu. Instead, it was Feng Qiuyan who practiced with Ming Xiu all day.

“Forget it, forget it. Your emotional quotient and reaction are too slow. My relationship with Ming Xiu’s family elders isn’t bad, so if you can get along well, I can consider letting you live together and cultivate together...”

“Sis Lan... Thank you for your kindness... There’s really no need. I’m more used to living alone...” Zhou Wen finally understood why Wang Fei said that the school had designated him as a student tutor and that he couldn’t reject it. So it was Ouyang Lan’s arrangement.

Unfortunately, he had missed Ouyang Lan’s good intentions.
