Chapter 1851: Nine Tribulations Devil Seed

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen could ignore the rules of Destiny Platform. He originally imagined that it wouldn’t be a problem to give Laughing Li a nudge.

However, that nudge immediately made him feel an extremely terrifying force repel his body into the void.

What is this place? When Zhou Wen stopped, he realized that he was no longer in the dimensional space.

The dimensional space was empty, but there were huge “glaciers” everywhere here.

Pieces of what looked like ice floated in the air. Some were like mountains, while others extended for more than ten thousand kilometers like a glacier continent.

There were things that looked like icebergs everywhere in the void, but Zhou Wen knew that they weren’t ice because he didn’t feel any coldness.

Just as Zhou Wen was sizing up the crystals, his eyes suddenly focused. He saw that in a nearby mountain-like crystal, there was a fellow wearing a grayish-black cloak. Apart from not having a scythe, he looked like Death.

Isn’t this the dimensional creature that attempted the trip up the staircase? Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated.

This place was clearly the final destination for those who failed to ascend the Destiny Platform. He didn’t know the consequences of being thrown into such a place.

Light flashed from his body as Prisoner and the Child of the Land of Depravity’s Holy Spirit attached themselves to him, protecting his body with Mystic Thearch.

Mystic Thearch’s Sovereign of the Universe could allow Zhou Wen to go anywhere in the universe, but he couldn’t teleport here. The other teleportation abilities of Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping and Godfiend Era also lost their effects.

This place seemed to be an independent space outside the universe without any connection to the original universe.

The wings on Zhou Wen’s back flapped as he traversed the huge crystals.

He saw many creatures sealed in crystals. All of them were lifelike as though they were just sleeping.

These creatures weren’t limited to those who had failed to ascend the stairs. There were also some dimensional creatures that Zhou Wen had never seen before.

What creature is that? Zhou Wen saw an extremely huge crystal that was probably many times bigger than Earth.

And in the crystal was a strange creature. Its black metal body was winding like a dragon, and its whiskers were as huge as a mountain range.

Could this be an Apocalypse-grade creature? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred.

If this was really an Apocalypse-grade creature, wouldn’t it be like meat on a chopping board to him? He could chop it up however he wanted. The opportunity to advance to the Apocalypse grade was right in front of him.

Suddenly, he heard a terrifying explosion from afar. He scanned it and immediately discovered an old acquaintance.

In the distant void, the rules of the New World erupted from Karoman’s body, but it was no match for its adversary.

On its body, ice crystals were spreading as though they had grown out of its body.

The New World rules on Karoman’s body erupted as it pulled out the crystals that grew out of its body. Its fur and flesh were torn apart.

However, the speed at which it pulled out the crystals couldn’t keep up with the speed at which the crystals grew. More and more crystals appeared on its body.

“Karoman, why are you here?” Zhou Wen blinked to him and asked.

Zhou Wen didn’t remember when Karoman had entered the Destiny Platform. How did this fellow end up in this strange place?

When Karoman saw Zhou Wen, it could be said that its eyes were especially red as though it had met an enemy. It directly conjured New World rules that enveloped Zhou Wen. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Zhou Wen used the New World’s rules to resolve Karoman’s attack and said with a smile, “You can’t even protect yourself, yet you still want to kill me. Do we have such a huge grudge?”

“If it weren’t for you, would I be trapped in such a godforsaken place? Even if I die, I’ll drag you down with me.”

“Why don’t you tell me what difficulties you have? Perhaps I can help you. There’s no need to fight to the death,” Zhou Wen said.

“Help me... Eh... Why didn’t you...” Just as Karoman was about to curse Zhou Wen, it suddenly realized that something was amiss—those strange crystals weren’t growing on Zhou Wen’s body.

“Ahem... You’re right. There’s no need to fight to the death. We are all people of status. We should talk nicely.” Karoman’s change in expression was unimaginable.

“Um... Human Sovereign... Look at what’s on me... Can you help me get rid of them first?” Karoman licked its lips and said to Zhou Wen.

“I have to take a closer look at this. Tell me first how you grew these things. Perhaps I have a way,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“I don’t f*cking know how this thing grew. Previously, after you screwed... had a friendly exchange with me, I found a way out in the dimensional space. Who knew that I would accidentally enter this godforsaken place. Then, these damn things began to grow on my body. Furthermore, they grew longer and longer. They continued growing after I plucked them out. How can you not have this on you?” As Karoman spoke, it suppressed its desire to express its true thoughts while speaking nicely.

“Perhaps humans are born immune,” Zhou Wen said.

“Immune my ass. I saw many humans wrapped in crystals over there...” Karoman shouted loudly in the beginning, but when it realized that it still needed Zhou Wen’s help, its voice slowly turned gentle.

“In that case, my strength might be able to restrain these crystals. Do you want me to help you pull it out?” Zhou Wen stared at it and said with a smile.

“Bro, thank you so much. From now on, you are my brother. If there’s anything, just say my name. I guarantee that no one in the dimension will dare touch you.” Karoman was overjoyed as it hurriedly said, “Bro, quickly do something. The crystals on my body are growing.”

“Alright.” Zhou Wen waved his hand and slashed at the crystal on Karoman’s body.

He didn’t really want to help Karoman. He just wanted to see if his strength could really restrain the crystals.

Crack!

The crystals shattered when the power of In the Human World slashed at them. The shards fell, disappearing in the air.

When Karoman saw that the crystals that Zhou Wen had shattered didn’t grow back, it shouted excitedly, “Bro, you’re really something. This move is really useful. Quickly remove the crystals from my body.”

I don’t know how to leave this place alone. It’s good to have this fellow to scout the way. With a thought, Zhou Wen slashed out again using In the Human World, shattering the crystals on Karoman’s body.

Soon, the crystals on Karoman were all shattered, and they didn’t grow back.

Without the crystals, Karoman felt extremely relieved. It shook its body and the bloody wounds immediately healed at a speed invisible to the naked eye. In the blink of an eye, it was back to normal.

“Bro, not bad. You’re different from those treacherous humans. If there’s anything in the future, just give my name. I guarantee that no one will dare provoke you in the dimension,” said Karoman.

“Karoman, do you know how to leave this place?” Zhou Wen naturally didn’t take its words to heart.

“Who the hell knows how to get out? I don’t even know how I got in,” Karoman said gloomily.

“Then let’s find a way out together.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he flew in a direction.

“Wait for me. I’ll go with you.” Karoman was afraid that the crystals on its body would grow out again, so it hurriedly followed Zhou Wen.

The two of them hadn’t walked far when they saw a huge metal creature sealed in the crystal. Karoman immediately said in horror, “This is... a Nine Tribulations Devil Seed... Why is it here...”
