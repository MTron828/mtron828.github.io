Chapter 785: Valley of No Return

“Is this person... a devil?” Butterfly looked at Zhou Wen and felt a chill run down her spine.

They had painstakingly come here to sign a contract with the Guardian and obtain greater strength.

As for Zhou Wen, he had chopped off the Guardian’s head with one palm. Although they knew that this person wasn’t an enemy, the difference in strength still left them in despair. They even trembled in body and mind.

Li Mobai didn’t think so. His eyes burned as he stared intently at Zhou Wen as though he had discovered new land.

So this is a possible route? Li Mobai felt as though a ball of fire was burning in his body.

There was no fire in Zhou Wen’s body, but as the Guardian’s body disintegrated and vanished, energy surged into his body, causing Slaughterer Life Soul to automatically switch over. After absorbing the energy, it became stronger.

To Zhou Wen’s disappointment, although Slaughterer became stronger, it didn’t advance to a Perfect Body even after the energy was completely absorbed.

How many Guardians do I have to kill to advance Slaughterer to a Perfect Body? Zhou Wen sighed inwardly.

Li Mobai, Gu Shanshui, and company had already returned. Zhou Wen said, “Sorry for not giving you guys an attempt.”

Li Mobai smiled and said, “It’s fine. It’s not important. If it’s convenient, can you tell me why you killed the Guardian? Why didn’t you sign a contract with him?”

“There’s no need for a contract.” Zhou Wen couldn’t explain too much.

“That’s right. You really don’t need it anymore,” Li Mobai said.

Butterfly, Gu Lou, and company felt that Zhou Wen’s words were too arrogant, but when they recalled the scene of the Guardian’s head falling, they felt powerless at refuting him.

“Since we’re already here, why don’t we take a look at the entrance of the Valley of No Return?” Zhou Wen was still wondering if he could find the tiny palm symbol there. With the Valley of No Return, he would have a place to grind for Gu-type Companion Beasts in the future.

“Alright. With you around, the Valley of No Return shouldn’t be able to do much to us. It’s good to broaden our horizons,” Li Mobai said with a smile.

“I’m just taking a look outside. I don’t plan on entering.” Zhou Wen shook his head.

Although he had the chick that could suppress Gu, the chick hadn’t grown up yet. If there were too many Gu, it wouldn’t be able to deal with all of them. Or perhaps there were Gu that weren’t afraid of the chick. If they were to come to blows, the chick might not be able to defeat a Mythical Gu.

Zhou Wen was very surprised that the chick could kill those Mythical Gu. He didn’t know if the chick’s noble phoenix bloodline was working or if it had some special power. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Furthermore, after delivering Immortal Slaying, Zhou Wen’s strength had been drained. His body was still in a weakened state. Although he wasn’t as miserable as when he used the Immortal Slaying skill in the past, his combat strength was now greatly affected. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to take the risk at such a time.

The group left the underground cave and arrived at the periphery of the Valley of No Return.

Zhou Wen saw that the valley was stacked layer by layer. There was a valley in a valley, but he didn’t know how big the space was. However, he had heard from locals like Gu Shanshui most people who entered the Valley of No Return never returned. It was what gave it its name.

However, it wasn’t that no one returned alive. There were still exceptions. However, those people didn’t venture deep into the valley. Most of them only circled around the valley entrance before coming out.

Zhou Wen only wanted to circle around the valley’s entrance to find the tiny palm symbol, but he had no intention of entering.

His luck seemed to be surprisingly good. After circling the valley for a while, he found an extremely inconspicuous palm symbol on a mountain wall.

The tiny palm symbol was covered by dense grass and was covered in moss. If Zhou Wen didn’t have Truth Listener’s ability, he wouldn’t have discovered it.

He took a picture with his mysterious phone and saw it downloading. Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief.

I’ve gained quite a lot this time. I downloaded the Valley of No Return instance dungeon and killed a Guardian. I even made the chick eat quite a number of Gu. I reckon it should be able to grow a little after digesting them, right? Zhou Wen felt that the trip had been quite useful.

However, Li Mobai had come for nothing. He hadn’t obtained any benefits.

Since Gu Shanshui wanted to go to Chiang Rai to capture the Corpse Bug, Zhou Wen had no choice but to accompany him to Chiang Rai. Li Mobai thought for a moment and said, “Master Gu, if you don’t mind, let’s go take a look.”

“Li, it’s great that you can go with us.” Gu Shanshui happily accepted.

Everyone walked along the Flower River towards Chiang Rai. After walking for two to three hundred kilometers, they saw Flowers of Life that hadn’t withered.

Zhou Wen rode the Great Might Vajra Bull at the back of the team and played with his phone. The dungeon in the Valley of No Return had been downloaded, so Zhou Wen went in to familiarize himself with the environment.

The Valley of No Return was actually surrounded by mountains on all sides. Only a sliver of an opening allowed entry.

The mountain walls on both sides were very close, allowing only one person to pass through sideways.

The blood-colored avatar walked in sideways as Truth Listener’s ability was constantly activated. At the same time, it switched its Essence Energy Art to Small Perfection of Wisdom. With the augmentation of the Eight Perfections Wisdom Life Providence and Hell King Life Soul, Zhou Wen’s senses became extremely sharp. Even without Truth Listener, he could see everything around him clearly.

After walking for a short while, Zhou Wen discovered a problem. There were many tiny holes on the walls on both sides. As they were so tiny, one would imagine that they were simply the stone walls’ textures.

However, Zhou Wen could tell that it wasn’t the texture of the stone. Instead, it was a series of tiny holes. In those tiny holes, there were extremely tiny worms and insects that would occasionally rear their heads. As they were so small, if an ordinary person wasn’t careful, they would end up having these creatures crawl into their body through their pores.

Since the chick couldn’t be brought in-game, Zhou Wen didn’t have a good way to restrain the bugs. All he could do was summon Tai Sui and see if it could eat the bugs.

Although Tai Sui wasn’t very interested in these bugs, it still devoured them under Zhou Wen’s orders.

A large number of notifications appeared on the game screen. They were all indications of him killing Mortal creatures. Occasionally, there would be a notification about him killing Legendary creatures.

There were very few items that dropped, and what did drop was basically useless. With Tai Sui’s help, Zhou Wen passed through the crack and arrived in the valley.

As this was a valley in a valley, Zhou Wen could see a circular valley that wasn’t too big. Inside was grassland that looked verdant.

However, if one had extraordinary vision, they would discover that there were many green caterpillars in the grassland. They were almost one with the grassland, making it difficult to distinguish them.

Zhou Wen summoned the Fire Furnace Queen and turned the grassland into a sea of fire. This only served to produce constant notifications of him killing Legendary Green-Haired Gu.

There seem to be quite a number of Gu. It’s a good place to grind. I wonder if there will be groups of Epic Gu inside?
