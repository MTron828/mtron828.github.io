Chapter 991: King of Earth

Translator: CKtalon

The palace in the deep sea was now empty. Ordinary dimensional creatures didn’t dare approach it. Of Night Thearch and the Seven Seas Dragon King, who lived here, one had fled while the Primordial Spore controlled most of the other’s autonomy.

Zhou Wen searched the entire palace, but he failed to find anything.

There were only some daily necessities and equipment here. It looked like this palace was more like a place that Night Thearch used for research.

Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in the research data and equipment here, but Hui Haifeng treated them like treasures.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to help him transport the equipment and data back. Although Hui Haifeng’s research direction was similar to Night Thearch’s, Hui Haifeng wasn’t as radical. The results he could produce wouldn’t be as unreliable as Night Thearch’s.

Without any results to speak of, Zhou Wen went to the Seven Seas Dragon King’s nest to take a look. This time, he discovered the blue glacier.

When he dug it out, he saw something that looked like a fingernail. It was very likely the tip of a dragon claw.

This discovery delighted Zhou Wen. He wasn’t a match for a Terror-grade creature yet, but with these Terror-grade items, he had a chance of injuring or even killing them. Therefore, Zhou Wen treated them like treasures.

Thinking that he hadn’t been to Infinite Island where Dragon Granny resided, Zhou Wen went there and found another terrifying item that looked like a dragon’s whisker.

The seven dragon monarchs and Dragon Sea Dragon King’s nests have the Ice Dragon King’s Terror items. If Night Thearch killed the Ice Dragon King, why did he place these things in the seven dragon monarchs’ nests? Why didn’t he collect them himself or destroy them directly? Zhou Wen was extremely puzzled.

If he hadn’t found the Ice Dragon King’s Terror items, it would have been difficult for him to injure Night Thearch, and he might not have been able to stop him.

Inside the empty underwater palace, Zhou Wen took out all the Ice Dragon King items—tooth, bone, scale, horn, whisker, claw, eye, and hair.

These were all parts of the Ice Dragon King, but they were not complete. They were only a very small portion.

Zhou Wen could clearly sense that there was a vague connection among the Ice Dragon King’s Terror items, but this connection was extremely weak and didn’t have much effect.

From the looks of it, there’s something missing? Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that the eight items weren’t complete.

The completeness Zhou Wen mentioned wasn’t referring to the Ice Dragon King’s body, but the eight items when placed together felt like something was missing.

The Thearch said that even a Terror-grade creature will find it difficult to revive after death, but just because it’s difficult doesn’t mean it’s impossible. I think there’s something wrong with these items. Otherwise, it would be impossible for Night Thearch to place them in different places. He could have kept them for himself. Zhou Wen wondered if there was another item that belonged to the Ice Dragon King in Night Thearch’s hands. Perhaps it was the most important one.

Ordinary creatures didn’t dare touch Terror items, much less carry them on their bodies. However, Night Thearch was naturally different. He was already at the Terror grade, so there shouldn’t be any problems.

However, he didn’t know where Night Thearch had gone. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to see him again, much less snatch the item in his possession.

In the next few days, Hui Haifeng did some research work. At the same time, he obtained information about Night Thearch. This information and equipment made Hui Haifeng more confident in solving Qin Ling’s problem.

He had already begun making preparations. He believed that they would be completed soon.

Zhou Wen didn’t understand any of that. When he was bored, he looked at the cube’s ranking and realized that the top ten had already been occupied by Guardians.

Furthermore, there were already fourteen Guardians on the rankings. During this period of time, there were more and more Guardians on the rankings. It looked like they all wanted to use this ranking battle to defeat their opponents.

Ranked first was still Ya. The second was still Great Skyfiend whom Ya had defeated. The third was Fairy Burial.

Following that were some Guardians that Zhou Wen had never seen before. Their names looked very powerful. There was also a fellow named Metal Reaper. Zhou Wen looked at his projection and realized that the Guardian was like a metal robot. It looked like it had explosive combat strength.

For some reason, Starry Night, who was previously ranked very high, had fallen to tenth place and barely maintained its top-ten standing.

Zhou Wen searched for Starry Night online and realized that a Guardian had challenged Starry Night previously, but Starry Night didn’t accept the challenge. Its ranking automatically dropped.

After a few consecutive challenges, Starry Night didn’t accept any of them and quickly fell to tenth place.

The reason Zhou Wen paid more attention to Starry Night was because he felt that Starry Night might be Liu Yun, but it was only a guess.

On the rankings, the Guardians that Zhou Wen could already confirm were Jiang Yan’s Fairy Burial and Uesugi Nao’s Great Skyfiend. In addition, Zhou Wen guessed that Ya was Zhong Ziya and Starry Night was Liu Yun. If he thought about it this way, among Wang Mingyuan’s students, only he and Hui Haifeng weren’t on the rankings.

Hui Haifeng wanted to do research, so he definitely wouldn’t participate in the battle. Zhou Wen didn’t have a strong desire to participate either.

Previously, he had wanted to participate in the battle because he wanted to go to the dimension to take a look at Wang Mingyuan’s situation. However, now that he knew that Wang Mingyuan was doing pretty well there, Zhou Wen lacked the motivation to participate.

It didn’t seem worth risking his life for a divine fruit. Furthermore, Zhou Wen hadn’t advanced to the Mythical stage, so it was impossible for him to participate in the battle. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As Zhou Wen was studying the ranking, he saw the cube suddenly light up. It was the countdown on it. There was only a month left.

On the cube’s screen, a shadow appeared. The shadow was distorted and blurry, making it impossible to see what it looked like, but it made one feel that it was a biological creature.

Zhou Wen had once entered the dimension and knew that the other party was indeed a biological creature, but because the level of the dimensional world far exceeded Earth’s, the vision of Earth’s creatures couldn’t accurately capture the other party’s physical characteristics. Therefore, it looked like a distorted shadow.

In fact, it wasn’t that the other party was distorted, but that the level of vision of humans on Earth was insufficient.

Soon, the figure emitted a voice. “In 720 hours, the first on the ranking will become the owner of Earth who will control the fate of Earth. Humans with Guardians, show your strength to your heart’s content. The victor is king, and the loser is vilified. This is an eternal truth. I look forward to the birth of the King of Earth.”
