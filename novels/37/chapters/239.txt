Chapter 240 Chaos of the Sky Spider

None of the special admissions students of Sunset College were weak. Although they were unable to kill the spider, they still used various methods and abilities to deal with the spider. They were not in danger at all. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, with the increasing number of spiderwebs surrounding them, the amount of space they and their Companion Beasts could move in became restricted. The battle became somewhat difficult.

Four or five spiders spewed out spider silk in Four Seasons Garden. Bright, crystalline spiderwebs could be seen everywhere. A Companion Beast had already been stuck to one, preventing it from struggling.

Having already discovered the spider’s weakness from her previous battle, An Jing stabbed forward like a bolt of lightning, instantly pinning a spider to the ground.

This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen An Jing fight seriously. Her swordplay was extremely intense, and each strike carried a dazzling glow, as though the void had been penetrated as well.

Zhou Wen immediately recognized the Primordial Energy Art that An Jing used. It was no doubt the Sun Strafe Art. Her sword techniques were somewhat extraordinary and although they looked simple, each strike made them look extremely gorgeous. The sword flashes were like dazzling divine beams.

She was so powerful that she looked as good as Lance. It was just that she and Lance used two completely different styles.

Lance’s technique was unparalleled, but An Jing’s every strike was like a bolt of lightning. If she could kill her opponent with one strike, she definitely wouldn’t require a second attack.

I deserved losing back then. With An Jing’s strength, Zhou Wen was indeed no match for her back then.

Seeing that An Jing could deal with the spiders in Four Seasons Garden, Zhou Wen immediately rushed out and saw that there were indeed spiders spewing out spider silk outside. A student was stuck to the spiderweb as the spider crawled towards him.

Zhou Wen raised his left hand and chopped down with Astral Slash Blade. The blade aura transformed into thin threads that sliced through the spiderweb. The remnant forces continued on and sliced the spider into two.

The schoolmate was still in shock. Before he could thank him, Zhou Wen had already rushed elsewhere.

There were many experts on campus. Besides the Epic counselors, there were also quite a number of students who could kill the spiders. The spiders in the school were quickly subdued.

“All students, may I have your attention... All students who have the ability to kill spiders... please enter the city immediately to aid the military... This is not a drill... I repeat, this is not a drill... All students who participate in the hunting of spiders will be rewarded with credits...” The broadcast rang again.

In fact, Zhou Wen had already run to the school’s entrance and ridden the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant out of the school.

The situation in the city was indeed much worse than the school. From afar, Zhou Wen could see the intertwined spiderwebs in the middle of buildings. The city looked like a spider forest with webs everywhere.

Many citizens had already been stuck to the spiderwebs. Quite a number of people had already been killed. The military were firing with their assault rifles in all directions. However, the effects looked limited. It was only possible for them to kill a spider after several consecutive shots hit the target.

Moreover, the spiders moved very agilely and they were protected by the webs. When a bullet hit the web, it was stuck and had its effects limited.

A mother carrying a child was bound by a spiderweb and was left hanging in the air, suspended in the middle of the building. They were just seconds from having the spider pounce at them.

The eyes of the soldiers below were bloodshot, but they didn’t dare fire. It was too close to the mother and son. If they shot, they might accidentally hit the innocent.

Just as the spider was about to bite the mother and son, a figure flashed across the sky. The spiderweb and the spider were split into two. The duo who fell were grabbed by the figure before landing safely on the ground.

The soldiers came over to rescue the mother and son, leading them to seek refuge. A soldier asked Zhou Wen, “Are you a student at Sunset College?”

“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.

“Please provide assistance to the Duke of Zhou Temple. That area has become a spider disaster zone and is spreading outwards,” the soldier said to Zhou Wen.

“Alright,” Zhou Wen replied before riding the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant towards the Duke of Zhou Temple.

The person that worshiped at Duke of Zhou Temple was Ji Dan. He was King Wu of Zhou’s younger brother, had been regent twice, and helped King Wu of Zhou in clinching victory at the Battle of Muye. He was also involved in the establishment of rites and the creation of music, earning him a consecration from future descendants.

Zhou Wen stormed through and killed several spiders on the way and rescued some citizens.

However, along the way, many citizens had already turned into corpses. They looked as if they had been sucked dry as they hung on a spider web attached to skyscrapers.

Just one break-out creature can cause such a disaster. If the various dimensional zones are unable to trap those dimensional creatures, what will the world become? Zhou Wen felt that his strength was minute.

The battle in the sky continued as a few Epic stage experts rushed over. In the sky, they were fighting the Sky Spider, but the situation didn’t look good. No one could pose a threat to the Sky Spiders. Instead, their Companion Beasts were stuck to the spiderwebs. No matter how much they struggled, they were unable to escape.

“Zhou Wen, are you going to the Duke of Zhou Temple as well?” Zhong Ziya charged over from another direction and happened to meet Zhou Wen.

The thin sword in his hand was unbelievably fast. Wherever the sword passed, the spiders would have their foreheads instantly penetrated by a sword beam, leaving only a wound that resembled a needle hole, accentuating their deaths.

“There was a soldier who said that it needs reinforcements,” Zhou Wen said as he tore open the spider webs.

“Me too. Let’s go together.” Zhong Ziya rushed over with his sword in hand.

Zhou Wen followed. Soon, he met a few other students who had been invited by the military to reinforce the Duke of Zhou Temple.

The military’s Epic powerhouses were rushing into the sky to fight the Sky Spider. If they didn’t get rid of the Sky Spider as quickly as possible, the spiders that it spat out would be endless. All they could do was leave the spiders below to ordinary soldiers and some Legendary military officers.

Zhou Wen and the other students from Sunset College would become officers if they chose to join the army after graduation. There was no need for them to start off as enlistees.

Usually, when the students were together, it was difficult to tell who was truly strong, but when it came to real battles, everything became obvious. Zhou Wen had never seen some of the powerful students in the school rankings before.

A person like Zhong Ziya was definitely not weaker than Wei Ge, the president of the student council. He could even be stronger; however, he didn’t have a ranking.

The pair of siblings from the Wu family were terrifying as well. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but marvel at how many hidden dragons and crouching tigers there were at Sunset College.

Just as they were about to arrive at Duke of Zhou Temple, Zhou Wen saw Hui Haifeng leading a group of people in a battle with the spiders. The surrounding soldiers were also watching the front lines as they fired crazily.

They had yet to see the Duke of Zhou Temple, but the number of spiders ahead of them was uncountable. It was unknown how many of them were crawling out.

“This city has become a spider’s nest,” Zhong Ziya said.

“Cut the crap. Hurry up and provide reinforcements. We can’t hold out any longer!” Hui Haifeng shouted.

Zhou Wen, Zhong Ziya, and the rest of the students rushed forward and blocked the swarm of spiders. It was a chaotic scene where they killed countless spiders. Yet, the number of spiders that charged out from the Duke of Zhou Temple remained constant.
