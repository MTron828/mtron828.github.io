Chapter 712: Incubating the Invisibility Cloak

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen summoned the Chaos Egg in reality, and an eggshell immediately enveloped his body, making him appear as a newborn baby constrained within.

Inside the Chaos Egg, there was a mysterious force flowing. It was like water, but it wasn’t corporeal.

Zhou Wen couldn’t move, nor did he know what use this eggshell had.

Under such circumstances, Zhou Wen couldn’t even move, much less fight. Such a Life Soul was probably useless in battle.

I’ll ignore it for now. I’ll try hatching the Invisibility Cloak. Zhou Wen took out the Invisibility Cloak’s Companion Egg and attempted to hatch it.

In the chaos egg, Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy stirred, and the Invisibility Cloak Companion Egg reacted. What was even more magical was that the strange power in the Chaos Egg also flowed into the Invisibility Cloak egg.

The life force in the Invisibility Cloak Companion Egg increased in intensity. Before long, the Companion Egg transformed into a stream of light that entered Zhou Wen’s body.

It’s done! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. After waiting for so long, he had finally hatched the Invisibility Cloak. It would be much easier for him to go anywhere in the future.

With the Invisibility Cloak, he could freely enter the dimensional zones controlled by the various families. He had long wanted to visit a few dimensional zones, but because they were controlled by the six families, he had no chance of entering them.

Zhou Wen already knew the Invisibility Cloak’s stats which remained unchanged. He summoned it and put it on. A magical scene happened as Zhou Wen’s body vanished into thin air. It was true invisibility. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Zhou Wen experimented and realized that the Invisibility Cloak’s ability only made him visually invisible. To truly be invisible, he needed to activate the Wheel of Destiny.

Once the Wheel of Destiny was activated, Invisibility Cloak lived up to its name and reached an intangible state. No one could discover Zhou Wen’s presence.

However, the Wheel of Destiny had a time limit. He could only be truly invisible for three minutes.

Three minutes is about enough. With Doctor Darkness’s Darkness Right Hand, it won’t be difficult to assassinate someone. Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred.

In the past, he couldn’t kill the nine black dragons because they could combine their powers. Now, with the power of the Invisibility Cloak and Darkness Right Hand, he could completely conceal himself and aim to kill three black dragons first. He could mostly rely on the strength of Tyrant Behemoth, Truth Listener, and the other Companion Beasts to deal with the remaining six black dragons.

With this in mind, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to give it a try. Unfortunately, he had just used Darkness Right Hand once, so he only had two chances to use it. He had to wait for some time before the cooldown ended

“Young Master Wen, something happened to Deputy Governor Qin. Can you come over?” An Sheng spoke over the phone in a heavy tone.

“What’s wrong with Deputy Governor Qin? Is there anything I can help you with?” Zhou Wen had a rather good impression of Qin Wufu, so he hurriedly asked.

An Sheng said, “Deputy Governor Qin returned to Chess Mountain to preside over it the past few days. He happened to encounter a break-out creature that rushed out of Chess Mountain and engaged in an intense battle. Deputy Governor Qin was heavily injured. We have done everything we can but to no avail. We hope to use your strength to save Deputy Governor Qin.”

“I don’t know any medicine. I used the power of a Companion Beast back when I treated the parasitic spores,” Zhou Wen said.

“We want to borrow your Companion Beast’s strength. That’s our only hope. I’ll pick you up now. We’ll talk on the way.” As An Sheng spoke, he had already arrived outside the school.

Zhou Wen left school and got into An Sheng’s car. As An Sheng drove, he told Zhou Wen the general situation.

In fact, many experts in the Sunset Army had already made a diagnosis of Qin Wufu’s injuries and found the reason for his serious injuries, but no one could save him.

A strange dimensional creature had drilled into Qin Wufu’s brain. It was like a tumor that extended out blood vessels that intertwined with Qin Wufu’s brain matter.

Unless Qin Wufu’s brain was sliced open, it was impossible to extract the dimensional creature from his brain.

However, the brain was fragile. The dimensional creature had already penetrated deep into it and was entrenched in his brain. Even Chancellor Leng was unable to get it out without damaging Qin Wufu’s brain.

Many experts and specialists in the Sunset Army had thought of many solutions, but none of them would be effective.

However, if they ignored the dimensional creature, it would continue invading Qin Wufu’s brain. It was very likely that it would completely control Qin Wufu’s brain and turn him into a puppet.

An Sheng’s idea was to let Zhou Wen take a look and see if he could use the method of treating the parasitic spores to inject poison into the dimensional creature, causing it to die automatically.

“The poison itself might affect Deputy Governor Qin’s brain. Furthermore, I wonder how poison resistant the dimensional creature is. There’s no way to accurately apply the dosage with the poison. If too much poison is used, it will damage the brain. If too little is used, the dimensional creature’s final struggle might destroy the entire brain...” Zhou Wen pondered.

An Sheng nodded and said, “Actually, the experts have already analyzed this plan of treatment. Just as you said, it’s very dangerous, but at this stage, we can only give it a try. We can’t just watch idly as Deputy Governor Qin gets destroyed, right?”

“Let’s take a look at the situation first. There might be a way.” Zhou Wen surmised that Darkness Right Hand might be useful, but it was situation-dependent.

“Alright, let’s head over now.” An Sheng drove all the way to the military hospital.

Zhou Wen saw Qin Wufu, who was already unconscious, on the bed. He was connected to all sorts of instruments, and some strange Companion Beasts were by his side.

A Companion Beast that resembled a jellyfish wrapped around his head. Its tentacles connected to his brain, but it was unknown what use it had.

Beside the bed were a few doctors and nurses. Many officers were in the room next door, looking at Qin Wufu through the glass window. An Tianzuo was among them, and his expression looked terrible.

“Overseer, Young Master Wen is here.” An Sheng led Zhou Wen into the room.

Zhou Wen and An Tianzuo subconsciously glanced at each other before they involuntarily looked away.

An Tianzuo looked at An Sheng and was about to say something when the room was pushed open again. An officer walked over with an elder.

“Overseer, Mr. Dugu is here,” the officer reported.

“Mr. Dugu, please take a look at Deputy Governor Qin’s injuries,” An Tianzuo said to the elder.

The elder didn’t refuse. He looked at all the diagnostic information and some x-ray photos before saying, “It’s not impossible to eliminate the dimensional creatures in Deputy Governor Qin’s brain, but...”

“What conditions do you have?” An Tianzuo asked.

“Since Overseer is so straightforward, I won’t beat around the bush. I can revive Deputy Governor Qin given ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold,” the elder said confidently.
