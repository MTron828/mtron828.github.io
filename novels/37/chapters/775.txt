Chapter 776: Flower of Life

Translator: CKtalon

Li Mobai and company looked at Gu Shanshui in a puzzled manner. They didn’t know why he had suddenly changed his mind and was willing to take the huge risk to help them cross the Flower River.

“I wonder how I can help you, Master Gu?” Zhou Wen didn’t agree easily. Gu Shanshui had clearly noticed something from the chick.

Gu Shanshui said, “To be honest, our Gu family is also good at nurturing Gu and taming them. I discovered a Mythical dimensional creature somewhere and wanted to tame it into a Gu, but I failed because it was too powerful. If you are willing to help me, Mr. Zhou, you will definitely be able to subdue it.”

As Gu Shanshui spoke, he glanced at the chick. Clearly, his real goal was to seek the help of the chick.

“If it’s within our abilities, it’s only right for us to help each other. However, we are in a rush to head to the Valley of No Return. I’m afraid...”

Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, Gu Shanshui said, “Mr. Zhou, don’t worry. I’ll help you head to the Valley of No Return first. It won’t be too late for you to help me after we return.”

“Master Gu, I still have to ask what kind of Mythical creature you want to tame. What kind of abilities does it have? What do you want me to do?” Zhou Wen asked seriously.

Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to go back on an agreement, so he had to ask first.

“Mr. Zhou, may I have a word with you in private?” Gu Shanshui clearly didn’t want others to know about the dimensional creature.

Zhou Wen and Gu Shanshui went to the side before Gu Shanshui said, “The dimensional creature I want to tame is a Corpse Silkworm. It’s in an extreme Yin dimensional zone. It’s extremely dangerous for ordinary people, but Mr. Zhou, you have a Phoenix divine bird. It won’t be difficult for it to subdue the Corpse Silkworm.”

“I can agree to help, but I am only able to do my best when the time comes. I can’t guarantee that it will succeed.” After all, Zhou Wen had never seen the Corpse Silkworm before. He didn’t know how powerful it was, so he was being very conservative.

“That’s good enough.” Gu Shanshui was very open-minded.

After the two of them finished their discussion, they walked back. The few of them set off again. Gu Shanshui led Gu Lou and Gu He to open up the path ahead.

Along the way, they discovered some corpses with jellyfish fungi. Gu Shanshui’s expression turned solemn.

On the way, Gu Lou and Gu He secretly sized up the chick from time to time. Even Li Mobai and company took a few more glances at it. Clearly, they knew that the actions Gu Shanshui had taken had something to do with the chick.

The chick stood on Zhou Wen’s shoulder and looked around smugly.

Zhou Wen kept using Truth Listener to observe his surroundings, hoping to find the parent body of the jellyfish fungi. However, he didn’t find the mother. All he saw were the parasitized corpses.

Suddenly, Tai Sui emerged from his backpack. It flapped its wings and flew towards the foliage nearby.

“What happened?” Li Mobai and company looked at Zhou Wen.

“It’s fine. My Companion Beast has been in my backpack for too long. It wants to take a walk,” Zhou Wen said casually.

He didn’t wish to be perfunctory, but even he didn’t know what Tai Sui wanted to do. There was no way to explain it clearly.

Zhou Wen kept using Truth Listener to observe the direction Tai Sui had flown in, but there was nothing there.

Tai Sui flew nearly a kilometer before diving into the ground and disappearing.

Tai Sui knew Earth Escape, so Zhou Wen couldn’t hear where it went. After a while, he saw Tai Sui burrow out of the ground and quickly fly back.

However, its stomach was clearly bulging. Zhou Wen did not know what it had eaten.

Everyone set off again when they saw Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast return.

On the way, although they encountered some corpses, they didn’t find any jellyfish fungi on them. When Zhou Wen saw this, he guessed that Tai Sui had burrowed into the ground and eaten the jellyfish fungi’s parent body.

Zhou Wen felt a little regretful. He didn’t even get to see what the parent body looked like before it was eaten by Tai Sui.

Without the interference of the jellyfish fungi, everyone moved much faster. Zhou Wen had gained some knowledge. Many of the strange creatures here were things he had never seen or heard of before.

Thankfully, with Gu Shanshui and company leading the way, they avoided the dimensional zones. Otherwise, if they were to enter a dimensional zone, there was no knowing how many terrifying unknown creatures they would encounter.

Zhou Wen saw a sea of flowers in the distance. The white petals and red stamens looked like a white river speckled by blood from afar.

“That’s the Flower River,” said Gu Shanshui as he pointed at the winding river-like flowers in the distance.

Everyone’s eyes were already focused on the Flower River. Zhou Wen was also using Truth Listener to search the Flower River, but apart from the flowers, there were no living creatures.

The locals called these flowers the Flower of Life. Wherever the Flower of Life appeared, there was no space for other creatures to live. Even weeds wouldn’t grow there.

In the past, it was very safe for humans to enter the Flower River. As there were no other creatures in there, much less dimensional creatures, the Flower River became an important route that connected nearby cities.

However, since a couple of weeks ago, none of the people who entered the Flower River had come out alive. They had all gone missing, and this route had been severed.

Zhou Wen carefully sized up the Flowers of Life. The flowers weren’t big and looked somewhat similar to the peach blossoms. They were beautiful.

“These Flowers of Life don’t look like dimensional creatures,” Li Mobai said as he sized up the distant Flowers of Life.

Gu Shanshui nodded and said, “The Flowers of Life existed before the dimensional storms. It’s a type of poisonous flower. After the dimensional storms, the poisonous flower mutated. Furthermore, the numbers increased, forming Flower River. However, for some reason, the mutated Flowers of Life don’t have any poison. Many people have experimented with the Flower of Life. It no longer contains any poison. Even if it’s eaten, it won’t cause any harm to humans. However, it might be different now. Everyone, please wait a moment. I need to do some experiments.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Zhou Wen and company stopped and waited for Gu Shanshui to carry out the experiments. As no one knew what the danger in Flower River was, they could only start by analyzing the Flowers of Life.

Unlike what Zhou Wen had imagined, Gu Shanshui opened a bamboo tube and released a worm that looked like a silkworm. It was fair and plump. The worm crawled towards the Flower River and first nibbled at the Flower of Life’s leaves and roots before chewing on the flower. It didn’t seem to have any problems.

“This is White Silkworm. It’s very sensitive to poison. If it absorbs poison, its body will show different colors,” Gu Shanshui explained.

“Now that White Silkworm hasn’t changed color, does that mean that the Flower of Life remains non poisonous?” Butterfly asked curiously.

Just as she said that, she suddenly saw the white silkworm straighten its body and fall from the flower. It died, but its body remained white without any changes.
