Chapter 1348: An Tianzuo Has Left

“Then let’s start with Professor Ouyang Ting…” Gao Dawei’s words immediately attracted Zhou Wen’s attention as his pupils subconsciously constricted.

As Gao Dawei spoke, he lowered his head as though he was thinking. When Zhou Wen focused and listened, he suddenly saw Gao Dawei’s figure transform into his molten chocolate form again. Then, he seeped into the ground like water.

In an instant, the chocolate demon crawled out of the ground again. However, the spot where he crawled out was where Zhou Wen was standing. The molten chocolate instantly enveloped Zhou Wen’s shoes and legs and quickly spread upwards. Zhou Wen’s shoes and clothes had already turned into chocolate as it constantly dripped.

“You’re still too inexperienced to fight me!” The chocolate enveloped most of Zhou Wen’s body as Gao Dawei’s smug laughter sounded from the boiling molten chocolate.

“Is that so?” Zhou Wen’s indifferent voice suddenly sounded, causing Gao Dawei’s smug laughter to stop.

In the next second, the chocolate wrapped around Zhou Wen’s body gathered in his hand like dust absorbed by a vacuum cleaner and instantly vanished without a trace.

Pa!

Zhou Wen’s fingers moved slightly as he closed the exquisite candy box in his hand. It was Sweetie’s candy box that had sucked away Gao Dawei.

Previously, Zhou Wen had spent considerable time studying the candy box and realized that it was a spatial item. However, this spatial item could only store sweets like candy. Apart from that, nothing else could be placed inside.

Later, when Zhou Wen learned spatial skills, he wondered if he could modify the candy box. If he could modify it into something that could store anything, he would have another spatial artifact.

He studied the candy box, but the outcome wasn’t satisfactory. He didn’t know what method the person who created the candy box had employed, but no matter what spatial skill Zhou Wen used, it couldn’t affect its candy-only characteristic.

At most, it could suck in candy from the outside world. Other than that, there was nothing special.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that the candy box was useless, but when he saw Gao Dawei’s chocolate demon state, he recalled the candy box.

Killing a person like Gao Dawei wouldn’t affect the Holy Land much, but if he could dig out more secrets of the Holy Land from him, it would be of great help to Zhou Wen.

Therefore, Zhou Wen had always wanted to keep Gao Dawei alive and not kill him. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Zhou Wen had long expected Gao Dawei’s sudden attack, thus he took the opportunity to suck him into the candy box. After all, the candy box could only suck in candy after coming into contact with it. It couldn’t suck candy from a distance.

After putting away Gao Dawei and closing the candy box, Zhou Wen turned to look at Sweetie on the ground.

Sweetie had been pretending to be unconscious, but she was alarmed when she saw Zhou Wen take out the candy box.

The candy box had been lost the last time she came to Earth. No matter how she searched, she couldn’t find it. She never expected it to be in Zhou Wen’s hands.

He shouldn’t have been born back when I came to Earth. It can’t be that he stole it. Then, where did he get the candy box??Sweetie felt that it was imperative that she figured out the problem, so she decided to delay Zhou Wen’s punishment. She wanted to figure out the origins of the candy box first.

When he saves me later, I can take the opportunity to approach him and figure out where he got the candy box from. However, if he tries to save me, he will touch my body and immediately turn into gold… But if I don’t let him touch me, how can I get close to him??Sweetie was in a dilemma as countless thoughts flashed through her mind. She was thinking of how she could prevent Zhou Wen from touching her when he came to help her and use the opportunity to approach him.

He’s here… What should I do… He’s coming… Should I wake up on my own…?Sweetie sensed Zhou Wen looking over and immediately became nervous. She still couldn’t think of a way to wake up naturally and approach Zhou Wen.

However, what happened next stunned Sweetie. Zhou Wen turned around and picked up Ya’er, who was beside her. He turned around and instant transmitted away.

He’s definitely a scumbag… baddie… He needs to be punished…

?Sweetie got up from the ground and looked in the direction Zhou Wen had left. Her eyes were about to spew fire.

If not for wanting to figure out where the candy box came from, she would have gone up to touch Zhou Wen and turn him into gold.

…

Zhou Wen took Ya’er to find the antelope and Chick who were resting. He told them about his encounter with Sweetie. The antelope also concurred that Sweetie wasn’t simple and suggested that Zhou Wen escape immediately.

Zhou Wen had the same thought. He took the antelope and Chick with him and didn’t immediately return to Luoyang. Instead, he went to several places, hoping to shake off Sweetie.

Zhou Wen and the antelope remained on high alert the entire time, but they heaved a sigh of relief when they didn’t discover Sweetie chasing after them.

Little did they know that Sweetie had been following Zhou Wen all this while. At that moment, she was sitting on the Earth Elemental Beast’s back, just inches from Zhou Wen.

Unfortunately, none of them could see Sweetie. They used all sorts of methods to scan their surroundings, but they did not detect her. They imagined that she had not followed them.

After rushing back to Luoyang, Zhou Wen felt physically and mentally exhausted. He originally imagined that he would be able to reap some benefits from this trip, but to his surprise, not only did he fail to reap any benefits, he was nearly killed by Starlady Polestar. He had also provoked a blonde girl who had appeared out of nowhere.

“I don’t plan on going out for the time being. Don’t invite me on your trips to places like dimensional zones,” Zhou Wen said to the antelope.

“Would I still dare to invite you? When did nothing happen when I’m out with you? I almost lost my life this time. Do you think I’ll invite you again?” the antelope said angrily.

“Ahem, it was purely an accident. Get some rest. Let me know if you need anything. I’ll head back now.” Zhou Wen hurriedly left the antelope’s room. He really had no answer to the problem.

Just as Zhou Wen left the room, he saw An Sheng standing not far away, as though he was waiting for him.

“Young Master Wen, do you have time to chat?” An Sheng came over and asked.

“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen saw that An Sheng’s expression wasn’t right.

An Sheng nodded. “Let’s talk in Overseer’s study. It’s not convenient to talk here.”

“There’s no need to go there, right?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“Don’t worry, Overseer isn’t around,” An Sheng said meaningfully.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. The meaning behind An Sheng’s statement that the Overseer wasn’t around was somewhat subtle. Zhou Wen knew that something had definitely happened, so he didn’t say anything else and followed An Sheng to An Tianzuo’s study.

This was where An Tianzuo usually worked. There were many special contraptions. Be it using Essence Energy Skills or high-tech methods, it wasn’t easy to eavesdrop on the people inside.

“Overseer has left Luoyang. It might be some time before he returns. Overseer hopes that you’ll take charge of the Overseer Manor while he’s away,” An Sheng said.
