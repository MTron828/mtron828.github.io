When Zhou Wen rushed to the cube, he saw Ya fighting a Guardian named Beast Deity.

Beast Deity held a huge stone hammer. Its strength was extremely powerful as it blasted away the Primordial Immortal Sword in Ya’s hand again and again.

Primordial Sword Immortal was the Primordial Immortal Sword in Ya’s hand. Its might was even stronger than Primordial Sword Immortal, but it failed to kill Beast Deity.

“Is Beast Deity that strong?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He had arrived a few hours later, but the battle was still continuing.

“That’s not the case,” Feng Qiuyan said excitedly. “That Ya is just too powerful. He has already defeated three Guardians consecutively. Beast Deity is already the fourth.”

“Fourth?” Zhou Wen frowned when he heard that.

“That’s right. That Ya is really too arrogant. He doesn’t rest at all. He accepts any challenge. Now, two of the four Guardians who challenged him have been severely injured and one has been killed. It looks like Beast Deity won’t be able to last much longer.” Li Xuan was envious and jealous.

“In that case, they clearly know that they aren’t a match for him, but they still challenge Ya?” Zhou Wen’s frown deepened.

“Isn’t that normal? Ya is in first place. Don’t all the Guardians have to vie for first place? What’s wrong with that?” Wang Chan asked in puzzlement.

Zhou Wen shook his head and didn’t say a word. All he did was look at Ya in battle.

Ya’s ability was really very strong. It wasn’t just strength, but his sword techniques were almost flawless. Even Zhou Wen, who had created the Heart Defying Sword himself, had to admit that Ya was definitely not inferior to him in sword techniques.

Furthermore, Ya wasn’t a person who solely relied on sword techniques like Zhou Wen. His various techniques reminded Zhou Wen of the Elegant Emperor Puppet’s Avatar Puppet in Tiger Cage Pass.

Could it be that Elegant Emperor is actually a Guardian? The Guardian that Zhong Ziya fused with is Elegant Emperor?

Zhou Wen suspected that there was such a possibility.

Zhou Wen had grinded Tiger Cage Pass so many times, but he had only seen Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet. He had never seen Elegant Emperor’s true body. He still didn’t know what kind of existence Elegant Emperor was. Perhaps he was really a Guardian.

Beast Deity shattered Ya’s body with the hammer, but it was only a puppet avatar. The real Ya had already appeared behind Beast Deity and stabbed through his back where his heart was.

Beast Deity made a prompt decision. Despite being injured, he turned around and used an arm to block Primordial Immortal Sword’s attack. Then, he admitted defeat and left the cube’s arena, choosing not to fight to the death.

All across the Federation, the citizens and media were in an uproar. Ya had four consecutive victories. Such a result was definitely unprecedented. After all, no one had seen consecutive battles between Guardians in the past. Ya was considered the first.

There was no time for Ya to rest. Another Guardian challenged Ya, causing everyone to cheer again.

“Ya... Ya... Ya...” Many people waved their fists in excitement as they shouted Ya’s name, hoping for him to continue accepting the challenge.

However, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. Although Guardians fought to clinch first place, there were actually Guardians who didn’t have this ability. There was no need for them to take the risk to participate in the battle. They could wait for the next opportunity.

After all, the ranking battles happened once a year. There was no need to be suicidal. They could wait.

However, the Guardians continued challenging Ya. It didn’t seem like they were trying to snatch first place. It was more like they were wearing Ya down.

Are the other Guardians joining forces to deal with Ya? Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred as he seemed to think of something.

That’s not right. Ya is different from the other Guardians. The other Guardians had only contracted with humans. However, Ya has absorbed his Guardian. If that’s the case, can Ya still represent the Guardian’s race? If he can’t, there’ll be no dimensional race that can take over Earth if Ya wins.

The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that he was right. That’s right. The various races of the dimension absolutely can’t accept such a situation happening. Therefore, any Guardian can be the champion, but not Ya... This is why he has been continuously challenged...

Now, Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. He didn’t know if Ya could hold on.

Even if he could hold on, the Guardians who really had a chance of obtaining first place were still secretly watching, ready to deliver a fatal blow at any time.

Zhou Wen had met Night Thearch, a fellow who had already advanced to the Terror grade. If he were to participate in the battle, Ya would be in even more danger.

Ya didn’t reject the challenge or even stall for time. He directly accepted another Guardian’s challenge.

He fought! He fought non-stop!

In front of the cubes all over the world were humans and even dimensional creatures.

The devils overseas were also paying attention to Ya’s battle, hoping to find his weakness.

However, despite Ya accepting the challenge of five Guardians in a row, no one could identify his weakness. This was because these five Guardians had been defeated by Ya in the same way.

Ya’s sword art combined with Primordial Immortal Sword possessed immense destructive power. Even Guardians found it difficult to resist it with their bodies.

However, this wasn’t the main reason for their defeat. The main reason was that they couldn’t tell if the person fighting them was Ya himself or his avatar.

Every time they fought with all their might, they would discover that the one fighting them was only a puppet avatar. The real Ya would suddenly appear and take their lives.

Sometimes, they couldn’t even tell if the person who injured them was Ya or an avatar.

It seemed that no one had ever made the right choice between the two, so no one could defeat Ya.

However, the challenge continued. There were still Guardians who wanted to challenge Ya.

They were determined to use a tag-team battle to defeat Ya. Just as Zhou Wen had guessed, anyone could be first, except Ya.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what Ya was thinking. He was still constantly accepting challenges. He didn’t even rest for a moment. After defeating a Guardian, he didn’t give himself any time to rest. As long as someone challenged him, he would always accept the challenge.

Something’s amiss! Zhou Wen looked at the battling Ya and found it odd.

Ya was crazy, but he didn’t give Zhou Wen the feeling that it was Zhong Ziya’s style.

Zhong Ziya was arrogant and heretic, but he was definitely not a hot-blooded fool.

Even Zhou Wen could tell that his stamina and Essence Energy had decreased drastically, but he was still constantly accepting challenges. If Ya was really Zhong Ziya, he would definitely choose to have a good rest until the last moment before accepting the challenge. He would choose to fight in an optimal state.

What happened? Zhou Wen really wanted to rush into the arena and ask Ya if he was Zhong Ziya or what had happened.

Unfortunately, Zhou Wen wasn’t a Mythical. He didn’t have the right to challenge anyone.

Wait a moment. Although I can’t enter the arena, my Companion Beast can. I just want to ask Ya. There’s no need to vie for first place. There’s no need to keep winning. Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred.
