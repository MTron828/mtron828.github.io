Chapter 924: Theft

There are only a few days left before the appointment with The Thearch. I need to prepare. Zhou Wen thought about his trip to another dimension to steal something.

The reason he agreed to The Thearch wasn’t entirely because he wanted her blood essence. Zhou Wen also wanted to go to the dimension to see what had happened there and why Wang Mingyuan wasn’t under the divine tree.

Although The Thearch said that she had already arranged everything, and that there would definitely be no danger as long as he followed her plan, Zhou Wen didn’t believe in absolute safety, so he had to make preparations.

As it was too dangerous, he definitely couldn’t take Ya’er with him. After all, her body wasn’t strong. Even if her body could keep up with her mental strength, she was only at the Mythical stage. The Mythical stage was only a bottom feeder in the dimension. It was too dangerous.

Zhou Wen explained his trip to the dimension to Ya’er and got her to stay at Ouyang Lan’s place for a few days. He would pick her up when he returned.

Ya’er finally nodded in agreement. Seeing that she didn’t show any signs of violence, Zhou Wen felt relieved to leave her alone.

Zhou Wen called Ouyang Lan in advance and she happily agreed. She even urged Zhou Wen to take Ya’er over as soon as possible.

On the day of departure, Zhou Wen took Ya’er over before heading to Chess Mountain alone.

He came in front of Chess Mountain’s mountain wall again and saw the flower on it. Zhou Wen said, “The Thearch, I’m here for the appointment. Now, you can tell me what I should do, right?”

The flower twisted the flower bud towards Zhou Wen and said, “It’s very difficult for humans to cross the dimensional barrier to reach the dimension. Therefore, you need a lot of preparation work.”

“Isn’t it very easy to reach there through the cube?” Zhou Wen asked.

“It’s different. The cube is equivalent to an official door. It’s naturally easy for you to enter through the main door. However, if you want to steal something, it’s naturally impossible for you to walk through the main door. You have to climb over the wall or dig a hole to enter. The difficulty is naturally different. Just like Wang Mingyuan previously. He used the power of the six Holy Temples to successfully break through the dimensional barrier. If you want to enter, you have to do it without anyone noticing. The difficulty is even greater.”

The Thearch paused and said, “However, with me around, this isn’t a difficult task. At most, it will be a waste of time. However, after you enter the dimension, you have to be careful. Apart from acting according to the plan, if you encounter an emergency, you have to resolve it yourself. Remember, don’t use force unless it’s absolutely necessary. Your combat strength is too weak there.”

With that said, The Thearch opened the mountain wall and allowed Zhou Wen to enter Chess Mountain.

This was the second time Zhou Wen had entered Chess Mountain in real life. He was very familiar with everything here, but he had seen a cartoon version in-game. It had a beautifying effect that masked the more sinister and terrifying appearance in real life.

As Zhou Wen walked into Chess Mountain, The Thearch explained what Zhou Wen needed to do and the steps to take.

The process wasn’t complicated, but the problem he encountered was troublesome. Zhou Wen entering a dimensional zone to steal things was no different from a child entering a pack of wolves to steal their wolf cubs. If he was discovered, the chances of survival were slim.

When The Thearch explained the plan to Zhou Wen, he confirmed that The Thearch wasn’t Nine-Tailed Fox. This was because to enter the dimension, he had to use the bronze tripod that chained the Nine-Tailed Fox.

The Thearch got Zhou Wen to use some means to fool the Nine-Tailed Fox, allowing him to borrow the power of the bronze tripod. If the Nine-Tailed Fox was The Thearch, there was no need to go through so much trouble. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Furthermore, from his previous visit to Deer Terrace Pavilion and the actions of The Thearch this time, she didn’t have much control over the interior of Deer Terrace Pavilion. She seemed to be different from the dimensional creatures inside.

What’s her background? Among the people related to Deer Terrace Pavilion, other than the three demons, what other women are there? Zhou Wen thought about it but couldn’t figure it out.

According to The Thearch’s plan, Zhou Wen went to the ancient building on Deer Terrace Pavilion and killed the fake immortals on the first level. He got a few jars of alcohol and entered the lower level of Deer Terrace Pavilion through a secret tunnel in the ancient building.

So the passageway to Deer Terrace Pavilion is here. Only then did Zhou Wen know the true way to enter the lower level of Deer Terrace Pavilion. Previously, he had relied on the Earth Elemental Beast to enter.

With The Thearch’s guidance, Zhou Wen circled most of the dangerous areas. Along the way, he killed some dimensional creatures that appeared.

When he arrived at a spot that Zhou Wen had never been to in-game, he placed the jars of alcohol in front of a stone door. Then, he pushed open the stone door by a sliver and immediately hid.

Soon, Zhou Wen saw a tiny, white beast crawl out from the crack in the door. It was a ferret-like creature. It looked around intelligently and discovered the opened wine jar on the ground. Its eyes immediately lit up as it rushed towards it.

In a short while, the tiny beast finished one jar after another. After it finished the last jar, it was extremely drunk. It curled up in the jar and fell asleep.

Seeing that the time was ripe, Zhou Wen tiptoed to the stone door and slowly pushed it open. He looked back at the little beast and saw that it was still sleeping soundly in the wine jar. Zhou Wen quickly walked in.

Behind the stone door was a huge hall. There were four statues consecrated in the hall. These four statues looked different from ordinary statues. They were more like generals in the human world and not immortals in heaven. Not only were they wearing armor, but their faces were extremely ferocious.

Zhou Wen still remembered The Thearch’s words as he looked at the third statue.

The statue looked ferocious like a general from a demonic realm. He held a strange umbrella in his hand. There were many pearls embedded in the umbrella, and on it were the words “Cosmic Bag.”

Zhou Wen tiptoed to the statue and carefully flew to the side of the pearl umbrella. He reached out and pressed down on a pearl before gently tapping on it three times.

The pearl dropped by itself. Zhou Wen hurriedly caught it and quickly left the door. He glanced at the sleeping white beast and quickly left.

Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief as The Thearch’s voice sounded in his mind. “Well done. Now, take the pearl to the bronze tripod cauldron and give it to the Nine-Tailed Fox. It won’t stop you from using the bronze tripod. Remember, after you enter the dimension, you only have 36 hours. Once the time is up, the bronze tripod’s passageway will automatically close. When that happens, your chances of survival will be very slim. You have to steal the bell in 36 hours.”

“Got it. Are you sure there won’t be any problems with the place the tunnel opens up to?” Zhou Wen asked.

“There won’t be any problems there. Don’t worry,” The Thearch said with certainty.
