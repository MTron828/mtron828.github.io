After the person came out of the grave, he looked no different from a living person. With Truth Listener’s ability, it was impossible to tell if he was human.

Crack!

The tombstone shattered. The mask embedded in the tombstone floated up and floated in front of the man.

The man glanced at the mask and muttered to himself, “Is it finally starting again?”

With that said, he picked up the mask and slowly placed it on his face. The strange mask stuck to his face as though it had fused with it.

It didn’t look like he was wearing a mask. Instead, it looked like the mask had grown on his face. It was an extremely strange feeling.

After the man put on the mask, Zhou Wen immediately felt his body regain its freedom. It was the same for Lance and the others.

“I’ll ask, and you answer. Now, you can speak. The rules here won’t kill you because you speak,” the masked man said calmly.

“Who... Who are you?” Lance stared at the masked man and asked.

Although he couldn’t move previously, he clearly had the ability to observe the masked man’s face. He was more puzzled than anyone else why the masked man’s appearance was identical to his.

The masked man didn’t answer his question and instead asked, “Are you a descendant of Frod?”

“That’s right. We are all Frod’s descendants. Who are you, Sir?” Gaiman asked the masked man.

“None of you are. Only he is.” The masked man slowly raised his hand and pointed at Lance with his index finger.

“Sir, what do you mean?” Lance stared intently at the masked man and asked.

“Frod has an agreement with me. He will give me his descendant, and you are his descendant,” the masked man said.

Although his words were odd, Zhou Wen believed them a little. This was because Lance shouldn’t have been part of this operation.

Lance had never contracted a Mythical Companion Beast before, and he had just been injured. Furthermore, with his special identity, he shouldn’t have come here to take the risk.

However, Frod had made Lance participate in this operation. For this, he had specially contracted a Mythical Companion Beast for him.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that it was because Frod wanted to train Lance and give him more experience that he was allowed to carry out this mission.

From the looks of it, it wasn’t that simple. Perhaps the masked man’s words were true.

“What are you talking about? There’s no such thing. We are all Frod’s blood relatives. Even if he really has a deal with you, it shouldn’t be Lance.” Gaiman shielded Lance behind him, but his expression was somewhat odd.

Although Gaiman’s words were firm, he was just as suspicious as Zhou Wen.

“No, you aren’t. The bloodline in you is only Frod’s bloodline as a human. That means nothing to me. Only he has the bloodline of the non-human Frod—the body I need,” the masked man said.

“Nonsense. He’s my grandson, and I’m Frod’s son. In terms of bloodline, I’m naturally closer to Frod. Who are you? Why are you making up these lies?” Gaiman summoned his Companion Beasts and gestured for Lance and company to retreat out of the garden.

“The bloodline I’m talking about might be a little different from what you understand, but it doesn’t matter. From the looks of it, Frod doesn’t plan on offering him to me,” the masked man said as his gaze shifted to Zhou Wen. “From the looks of it, he prepared a better body for me in order to redeem the one of his bloodline.”

When the masked man first spoke, Zhou Wen realized that he might have been scammed by Frod. Now that he heard the masked man say that, he no longer had any doubts. He had indeed been scammed.

“Who are you?” Lance stared at the masked man and asked again.

The masked man answered unhurriedly, “I’m not a human. I’m a Guardian, the Guardian of the Maze of Lies.”

“How is that possible? You are a human. Besides, the Guardian of the Maze of Lies has already been killed.” Lance naturally didn’t believe it.

The mask on the masked man’s face was like a human’s face. He revealed a somewhat evil expression. “I only said that I’m the Guardian of the Maze of Lies, but I didn’t say that I’m the current Guardian.”

“You aren’t wrong to say that I’m human. This is because only by fusing with a human’s body can I obtain the possibility of growth in this world. However, contracting a human is too troublesome. I still need to take care of the weak human. I hate trouble, so I chose to fuse with a human’s body and wield everything at my control,” said the masked man.

Zhou Wen immediately understood that the masked man was the opposite of Wang Mingyuan. Wang Mingyuan had fused a Guardian with his human body.

As for the masked man, he had absorbed a human with a Guardian’s body. The foundation was the same, but things were reversed.

“Are you a Guardian from the last Guardian battle?” Zhou Wen interjected.

“Sort of.” The masked man continued, “Although fusing with a human’s body allowed me to escape the restrictions of this world’s powers on aliens, I had no choice but to face another problem. A human’s body is different from a Guardian’s. A Guardian’s body won’t age, but a human’s body will age and die. I didn’t want to die, so I had to change my body before I aged. Therefore, I made an agreement with Frod. I helped him obtain what he wanted. And in return, he will offer a child of his bloodline to me for my new body. According to the agreement, you have finally arrived in front of me.”

With that said, the masked man’s gaze looked at Lance before landing on Zhou Wen, not moving it away again. “Frod has put in a lot of effort. His bloodline was originally the most suitable for me, but I never expected such a body to exist among humans. I’ll accept his painstaking effort. Go back and tell Frod that I’ll take this body. The agreement between us is over.”

Lance, who was retreating, stopped when he heard that. He stared at the masked man and said, “Ignoring the fact I don’t believe such a thing exists, even if it does, this matter has nothing to do with others. This is an agreement between you and our family. Don’t implicate others.”

The masked man laughed when he heard that. “Are you going to destroy Frod’s hard work? In order to save you, he invited so many people in, hoping that I would choose another body. This is your only chance of survival. If I don’t choose him, you will definitely die.”

“Lance, let’s go.” Gaiman pulled Lance back.

However, Lance suddenly summoned his Companion Beast. Wearing his Companion Beast armor, he threw a punch at the masked man. “Then give it a try and see if you can snatch my body.”

Gaiman was alarmed. It was too late to stop him, so he could only cooperate with Lance in an attack.

Gemar and the other two members of the Ultimate Family Clan also attacked. Their Mythical Companion Beasts mostly had freezing abilities. All sorts of freezing beams blasted at the masked man.
