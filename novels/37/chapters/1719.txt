Chapter 1720 All Life is Equal

The pheasant was accustomed to having the final say at Kunlun Mountain. It pecked down without any regard for anything.

Zhou Wen’s eyes remained closed, but it was as though he had already expected the pheasant’s attack trajectory. He raised his palm slightly and extended a finger, blocking the pheasant’s beak.

At the instant the two came into contact, the wheel of light behind Zhou Wen was like a true black hole that instantly devoured everything

The man and pheasant didn’t seem to change, but their surroundings had become extremely strange.

The garden that was inches away vanished. The grass, flowers, and trees vanished as well. The golden-winged bird that was eyeing them covetously also vanished. It was as though Zhou Wen and the pheasant were the only ones left in the world. Everything around them was an empty darkness.

The pheasant was slightly stunned as it looked around, seemingly puzzled.

“All life is equal except for one life.” Zhou Wen’s eyes remained closed as he walked towards the pheasant.

The true power of Great Brahma’s domain was naturally not as simple as having powerful destructive power. This was the true power of Great Brahma’s domain.

In Great Brahma’s domain, all powers and life were isolated. Only the creatures that Zhou Wen pulled into Great Brahma’s domain could touch Zhou Wen’s body.

Any creature outside Great Brahma’s domain, even someone as powerful as the golden-winged bird, could only see an illusion without touching anything inside.

Unless the creature locked onto by Great Brahma’s domain died or Great Brahma’s domain was defeated, no external force could affect Zhou Wen.

The golden-winged bird noticed the anomaly and let out an angry cry. Its wings slashed at Zhou Wen with a terrifying golden light.

However, the golden light that could slice through everything seemed to slash at an illusion. No matter how many times it slashed at Zhou Wen’s body, it couldn’t injure him at all. The two seemed to be in two completely different spaces.

The pheasant remained as belligerent as before as it transformed into a white beam and charged at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was already filled with killing intent, but it didn’t show on his face. He was as calm as Buddha. His body moved slightly as he dodged the pheasant’s pecking. At the same time, he threw a punch at the pheasant’s abdomen.

The pheasant flapped its wings and instantly leaped into the air, dodging Zhou Wen’s fist. At the same time, its hook-like claws reached out for Zhou Wen’s eyes.

Great Brahma only had one face and a pair of arms left under the armor, but this didn’t mean that the other abilities had vanished. They had only been fused into this face.

Faced with the pheasant’s claw attack, Zhou Wen’s speed was too slow to dodge or block. He had no intention of dodging or blocking as he used his helm to block the pheasant’s indomitable claw attack.

Bang!

The indomitable claw grabbed the dark-gold helm, but it failed to penetrate it. It didn’t even make Zhou Wen take a step back. Instead, it let out a tragic cry as it flew backward as though it had suffered a heavy blow.

Great Brahma also had the ability to reflect damage. After fusing all four sides, this ability became even stronger.

Looking at the pheasant that flew out, Zhou Wen tore through the void and instantly arrived in front of it. He punched it repeatedly like a storm.

Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

The pheasant suffered continuous attacks as its body staggered from the impact, distorting in the air.

It had to be said that the pheasant’s body was extremely powerful. Typical Calamity-grade creatures would have long been shattered by such a destructive force.

However, the pheasant only let out tragic cries. Feathers were constantly sent flying, but it didn’t suffer a fatal blow, nor did it lose its combat strength.

It even reached out its claws and beak to counterattack during the gap between Zhou Wen’s attacks. However, when its attacks landed on Zhou Wen, it ended up being injured.

Seeing Zhou Wen crazily attack the pheasant, sending its feathers flying everywhere, the golden-winged bird outside cried out angrily. The golden light on its body erupted like a volcano as it slashed at Zhou Wen’s figure again and again.

However, such a terrifying attack was completely useless. It could clearly see Zhou Wen, but all its forces passed through him. It was as though he was a mirage. No matter how destructive the golden-winged bird’s power was, it was useless against Zhou Wen while he was inside Great Brahma’s domain. All it could do was panic outside.

“It doesn’t matter if you are a phoenix or a pheasant. Even if you are the Son of the Universe, you are only a living creature. You only have one life. Fight with your life on the line; there’s only you and me.” Zhou Wen punched the pheasant again and again. The strikes weren’t fatal, but made the pheasant scream repeatedly as its feathers constantly tore apart.

The pheasant’s body, which was originally covered by white feathers, had golden skin exposed in many places. The skin was crystalline like gold crystal, as though there was a rainbow luster flowing within.

After suffering such ferocious blows, although the pheasant kept screaming, it became more ferocious. The rainbow-colored glow in its body intensified.

What was even more terrifying was that the pheasant only knew simple offensive techniques like pecking and claw strikes. They were far inferior to Zhou Wen’s rich techniques, but with the passage of time, the pheasant’s techniques became more varied.

In fact, no technique Zhou Wen used could injure the pheasant a second time.

If it were an ordinary Calamity-grade creature, they would have long been out of options and wouldn’t be able to injure the pheasant at all.

However, Zhou Wen’s combat techniques appeared infinite in number. A seemingly simple punch contained infinite variations, making it difficult for the pheasant to predict his attack trajectory. In terms of strength, Zhou Wen might not be the strongest on Earth, but in terms of combat realm and techniques, no one on Earth was his match.

Ignoring the infinite variations of the three thousand sword intents, just the Small Perfection of Wisdom realm was enough to turn Zhou Wen into something magical. It was as though a simple move would become unpredictable and unfathomable in Zhou Wen’s hands.

The pheasant was constantly struck. Its feathers flew in the sky.

Yi!

Just as it was about to turn into a bald chicken, the pheasant suddenly let out a strange cry. The rainbow-colored light in its body tore out and its entire body was enveloped by strange colors.

The body that was about to turn bald instantly transformed into rainbow feathers that covered its body again.

Not only that, but its body also underwent an inexplicable change. The feathers on its head and back grew longer and longer as they danced like immortal clouds.

The rainbow feathers on its body spread out in the wind. After it spread its wings, the rainbow-colored glass-like luster rose and danced, swirling around its body like immortal clouds.

At that moment, the pheasant no longer looked like a pheasant. It was clearly a rainbow phoenix surrounded by an immortal aura. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
