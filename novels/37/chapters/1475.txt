Chapter 1476 Extinguishing Hope

Zhou Wen was alarmed as he instantly transmitted to dodge the flames from Sovereign Sui’s statue, but the flames were too fast, giving him no room to dodge. Before he could activate instant transmission, the flames had already shone on him.

Zhou Wen seldom drank, nor did he have any experience of getting drunk. However, when the flames shone on him, he felt intoxicated.

Boom!

All of Sovereign Sui’s Tomb began spewing flames. The flames here were very strange. Although they were hot, they didn’t injure anyone.

Infinite flames condensed towards Zhou Wen and Human Sovereign. The Ancient Sovereign Sutra in Zhou Wen’s body seemed to circulate uncontrollably.

As the flames surged into him, Zhou Wen felt the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and Human Sovereign crazily absorb the flames from Sovereign Sui’s Tomb.

Could it be… Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised when he felt Human Sovereign’s transformation.

The Ancient Sovereign Sutra had already reached the Terror grade. If it could improve further, it would definitely be the Calamity grade. Human Sovereign’s sun-like body had already turned into a blob of magma after absorbing a large amount of flames. His body was no longer limited to just being a projection; instead, it became more and more corporeal.

As the Ancient Sovereign Sutra circulated and absorbed large amounts of flames, Zhou Wen vaguely understood something.

Previously, the humanoid monster had demonstrated the Calamity-grade Ancient Sovereign Sutra. However, his Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s path was different from the Ancient Sovereign Sutra Zhou Wen had comprehended, so it wasn’t worth much as a reference.

The power of fire in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb had a similar attribute to Zhou Wen’s Ancient Sovereign Sutra, but it wasn’t completely the same. It had its own unique traits.

Due to the similar attributes, Zhou Wen’s Ancient Sovereign Sutra was perfectly compatible with these flames. It was very easy for him to resonate with it.

Now, Zhou Wen vaguely understood that to use the dimensional zones’ powers to raise his Essence Energy Art didn’t require any special methods. All he needed to do was find a dimensional zone that was compatible with his Essence Energy Art.

However, this didn’t mean that finding such a dimensional zone was considered a success. Just like how Essence Energy Arts varied in strength, dimensional zones were the same.

There were countless fire-elemental dimensional zones in the four districts of the Federation, but not every dimensional zone could help a Terror-grade creature advance to the Calamity grade.

There was another key point. Zhou Wen didn’t know what to call an existence like the Human Sovereign statue, but only by finding it and using an Essence Energy Art to resonate with it could he use the dimensional zones’ powers to advance to the Calamity grade. Sovereign Sui’s Tomb was filled with flames that resembled bonfires that had flames surging into the sky. From the outside of the cemetery, it looked like a huge grave made of flames.

However, inside Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, the plants that had rapidly grown due to the influence of Sovereign Sui’s flames were also ignited. Soon, they were burned to ashes. They didn’t grow again due to the powerful vitality in the flames.

Zhou Wen observed all of this and came to a realization. To humans, Sovereign Sui created the way to create fire from rubbing wood. It brought light and fire to humans, but to plants, it’s a destructive blow. Problems should be viewed from different angles-good things might not necessarily be good.

With Zhou Wen’s comprehension, the flames in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb spewed out more and more violently as they surged towards Zhou Wen and Human Sovereign.

Yu Qiubai was filled with zeal. When he previously tried to persuade people to stay, they had ignored him and even rejected him. Those were the better ones. Those whose moral standards were lacking nearly cursed Yu Qiubai in the face.

Yet, in just a few days, the people who had been berating him cried and begged to stay. The changes were so fast that Yu Qiubai found it unbelievable.

This also gave Yu Qiubai hope. With Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, so many people, and with Zhou Wen presiding over it, Guide City might be rebuilt.

As there were too many people, the school couldn’t accommodate them anymore. Even the school’s vicinity was filled with people. The weather wasn’t too cold now, so they could stay outside for the time being.

Even if the skeleton legion didn’t mount an attack, it would be difficult for them to survive once the weather worsened.

Furthermore, with so many people, food, lodging, and transportation were problems. They had to quickly resolve the problem of the base. With a base, everyone could take up their own responsibilities to ensure order.

Yu Qiubai was thankfully the principal of the school. He had previously been in charge of managing the school’s various operations. The teachers and school management immediately came back under Yu Qiubai’s management.

Yu Qiubai could temporarily maintain order with their help.

After making the arrangements, Yu Qiubai went to Sovereign Sui’s Tomb to look for Zhou Wen. He wanted to discuss with him if he could get a group of people to enter Sovereign Sui’s Tomb to carry out the early construction work.

Yu Qiubai arrived at Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. Before he could head to the stone temple, he saw the flaming tomb. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

What’s going on? Could something have happened in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb? Yu Qiubai was alarmed because Zhou Wen was still inside. If something had happened to him, everyone in Guide City would be doomed.

Yu Qiubai turned around and ran towards the stone temple, hoping to rush in to see what had happened. If Zhou Wen needed help, he might be able to do something.

However, before Yu Qiubai could rush to the stone temple, he heard a loud boom coming from Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. Turning his head, he saw rows of collapsed walls.

The flames in the wall had already vanished. In the past, when he looked at Sovereign Sui’s Tomb from the outside, he could only see the walls and fog. Now, he could take in everything inside with a glance.

The scene inside left Yu Qiubai stunned.

The cemetery that was originally filled with all sorts of weeds and vegetation had now turned into scorched earth. There was no sign of life.

Furthermore, the various stone sculptures in the cemetery had already been charred black. Even the Sovereign Sui statue had vanished, leaving behind a pile of rubble. Only Zhou Wen was standing in the cemetery unharmed.

It’s over! Yu Qiubai was delighted when he saw that Zhou Wen was fine, but when he saw Sovereign Sui’s Tomb present state, his face turned ashen.

They originally wanted to establish a human city in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, but now that it was in such a state, they naturally couldn’t count on it.

He didn’t know if he could find another suitable dimensional zone. Even if he could find one in the future, with so many people waiting outside the school and constantly being harassed by the skeleton legion, who knew how many people could last until then.

Helpless, Yu Qiubai was just about to head over to take a look at Zhou Wen when he suddenly saw him emit a sun-like brilliance.
