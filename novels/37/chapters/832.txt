Chapter 833: Free Labor

Translator: CKtalon

Although the Chaos Egg was useful, it could only be used by himself and not others.

If his family and friends were seriously injured, the pill essences were far more useful than the Chaos Egg.

Zhou Wen sized up Pill Furnace Mountain and couldn’t help but be delighted. There was a tiny palm symbol on the rocks.

There really is one! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he looked at Zhang Yuzhi and asked, “Can I take a picture closer to Pill Furnace Mountain?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Definitely not for outsiders. However, just be quick. Don’t let others see you do it,” Zhang Yuzhi said as she blinked.

Zhou Wen hurriedly took out his phone and flew towards Pill Furnace Mountain. When he reached a distance that his phone could sense it, he snapped a picture of the tiny palm symbol and immediately the download screen appeared.

“Do you still want to continue trying your luck?” Zhang Yuzhi asked when she saw Zhou Wen return to the boat.

“My luck isn’t that good. Forget it. Let’s go somewhere else to take a look.” Zhou Wen thought of searching elsewhere. Perhaps he could find other dungeons.

After downloading Pill Furnace Mountain, Zhou Wen realized that it was only the Pill Furnace Mountain instance dungeon and not the entire Mount Dragon Tiger instance dungeon.

From the looks of it, this is different from Dragon Gate Grotto. I can’t download the entire dimensional zone at once. Zhou Wen followed Zhang Yuzhi and browsed through several important dimensional zones near Mount Dragon Tiger.

However, to Zhou Wen’s disappointment, apart from the Pill Furnace Mountain, he didn’t find the tiny palm symbol anywhere near the other dimensional zones.

However, having Pill Furnace Mountain is enough. After all, these pill essences are rare elsewhere.

“By the way, I heard that Earth Elemental Beast is very precious. Why is your family willing to auction it?” Zhou Wen asked.

Zhang Yuzhi hesitated for a moment before saying, “The Earth Elemental Beast is indeed very precious. It’s very likely that there’s only one in the world. It’s impossible for there to be a second one. However, this Earth Elemental Beast was obtained through the efforts of the six heroes back then. Due to the unhappiness caused by it, my great-grandfather didn’t hatch it, nor did he let any of his descendants hatch it. Because of this, he’s auctioning it off. I’m not too sure about the details.”

After a pause, Zhang Yuzhi continued, “I know that the other five families want it very much, so the price will be very high. I’m afraid you won’t have a chance.”

“Then why did you get me to come here to bid for it?” Zhou Wen said gloomily.

“Can’t you just treat it as a vacation and to visit a friend?” Zhang Yuzhi smiled.

The two of them walked on the mountain path. Just as they were talking, they saw a huge immortal crane fly over from the mountains. On the back of the immortal crane was a youth with a cold expression.

“Brother, why are you here?” Zhang Yuzhi said when she saw that it was Zhang Xiao.

“I have something to discuss with Zhou Wen.” When Zhang Xiao spoke to Zhang Yuzhi, his tone was very gentle, but when he turned to Zhou Wen, his tone immediately turned stiff. “Zhou Wen, do you know that Tyrant Behemoth originally belonged to our Zhang family?”

“So?” Zhou Wen asked Zhang Xiao.

Zhang Xiao was slightly taken aback and was momentarily at a loss for words. Zhou Wen had already hatched Tyrant Behemoth and fed it until it had advanced to the Mythical stage. It was clearly unrealistic for Zhou Wen to return Tyrant Behemoth.

The reason Zhang Xiao had come was because he was furious. He didn’t plan on doing anything to Zhou Wen. If Zhou Wen were to take a softer stance, Zhang Xiao’s anger would have dissipated.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t someone who would take a soft stance. The moment he shot back his retort, the two of them entered a frozen deadlock.

“Brother, forget it. You can’t blame Zhou Wen for this.” Zhang Yuzhi also spoke up for Zhou Wen, leaving Zhang Xiao even more depressed.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “How about this? Please help me feed Tyrant Behemoth. I won’t ask for any payment during this period of feeding. Just treat it as free labor for you.”

“What if I keep feeding it?” Zhang Xiao asked coldly.

“Then I’ll let it continue working for your Zhang family for free.” Zhou Wen paused before saying, “However, I have a condition. You have to feed it until it’s full. You can’t let it starve. Furthermore, you have to feed it until I leave Mount Dragon Tiger.”

“That’s more like it. Then it’s settled. Summon Tyrant Behemoth. I’ll feed it now,” Zhang Xiao said to Zhou Wen, afraid that he would go back on his word.

“Sure.” Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to follow Zhang Xiao.

“You don’t have to do this,” Zhang Yuzhi said apologetically.

“It’s fine. If he’d like to raise it, let him try it.” Zhou Wen felt pity for Zhang Xiao when he saw him leave excitedly with Tyrant Behemoth.

Tyrant Behemoth was indeed powerful. It even had a chance of advancing in the future. Others only saw its strength, but they didn’t know how much food it consumed every day.

If it wasn’t for the fact that there was an endless Essence Crystal mine in-game, Tyrant Behemoth would have long starved to death. Zhou Wen knew very well how much one had to pay to feed it in real life. Ordinary people couldn’t afford such a price.

Since Zhang Xiao wanted to feed Tyrant Behemoth, there was no need for Zhou Wen to stop him.

Zhang Xiao happily took Tyrant Behemoth back. As long as he fed Tyrant Behemoth, he could use it for free. Where could he get such a deal?

Zhang Xiao was secretly delighted. If Zhou Wen goes back on his word, he won’t have to be shamed even if I don’t disparage him. If he doesn’t go back on his word, I’ll keep feeding Tyrant Behemoth until Zhou Wen dies. I won’t return him no matter what.

“Zhang Xiao, what’s going on?” Zhang Chunqiu asked in puzzlement when he saw Zhang Xiao bring Tyrant Behemoth over.

Zhang Xiao recounted the matter proudly. “Zhou Wen knows that he’s in the wrong, so he lent it to us for free. There’s no need to give him the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman now.”

Zhang Chunqiu frowned when he heard that. He sized up the three to four-meter-tall Tyrant Behemoth and said, “I don’t think it’s that simple. That Zhou Wen isn’t such a thin-skinned person. Why would he be so kind as to lend us Tyrant Behemoth for free?”

“Tyrant Behemoth is here. If he goes back on his word, he will be embarrassing himself,” Zhang Xiao said.

However, Zhang Chunqiu didn’t think so. After some thought, he said, “Legend has it that Tyrant Behemoth eats mountains daily. Although the legend might be a little exaggerated, Tyrant Behemoth is definitely a glutton. Did you ask Zhou Wen what Tyrant Behemoth eats?”

“I did. He said that it eats Essence Crystals, Essence Gold, and anything else that contains Essence Energy. So what if it can eat? Aren’t we letting Tyrant Behemoth eat Fiend Stones? This is equivalent to free labor,” Zhang Xiao said with a smile.

“Perhaps.” Zhang Chunqiu had a nagging feeling that Zhou Wen wasn’t such a nice person.
