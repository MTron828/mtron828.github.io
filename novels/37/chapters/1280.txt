Chapter 1281: Nether Lotus

Zhou Wen was a spatial expert, so it wasn’t difficult for him to understand the content and annotations. Although Zhou Wen already knew a lot of the content, there were indeed some unique points that gave him many thoughts and ideas.

Based on the content, the person who wrote it had to be an existence with extremely high attainments in space. Only then could they stand at a high vantage point to explain certain problems.

Leng Zongzheng’s annotations were also very precise. Furthermore, he had written quite a number of his understanding and insights into spatial powers. It was quite an inspiration to Zhou Wen.

Combining his insights and experience, Absolute Space broke through to the Terror grade in just a few hours. Furthermore, it was constantly improving.

Although he didn’t know if he could really break through to the Calamity grade, the speed at which he improved was already rather shocking.

Zhou Wen was obsessed with studying Absolute Space. Apart from the necessary dungeon respawns every day, he spent the rest of his time studying it.

However, Ice Maiden wasn’t in a good mood. She had been worried about the flower girl all this time. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Zhou Wen didn’t know much about the dimension and didn’t know how terrifying the Flower Goddess was, but Ice Maiden knew her all too well. She was a true dimensional big shot, a supreme existence at the Apocalypse level.

Even if she wasn’t willing to personally descend to Earth, just mobilizing a large number of Flower race experts and Guardians to descend was enough to cause a huge calamity for Earth.

Ice Maiden was so worried mainly because she was a dimensional creature. She ultimately had to return in the future. Zhou Wen could ignore the repercussions, but she couldn’t.

If the Flower Goddess knew that she, an ice demon, had captured the flower girl and wanted to kill her, the ice demons might suffer greatly. It was even possible that the demons would abandon her to appease the Flower Goddess’s rage.

Of course, this was only the worst case scenario. It might not come to that.

What should I do? How can I make that flower girl let bygones be bygones??Ice Maiden racked her brains, hoping to come up with a perfect solution.

“Zhou Wen, I want to have a chat with that flower girl.” Ice Maiden failed to come up with a good solution despite racking her brains. She planned on understanding the flower girl’s current state of mind and why she had come to Earth.

In fact, Ice Maiden was very puzzled. Logically speaking, even if members of the Flower race were sent to Earth, they would be cannon fodder. How could one with the Tear of the Flower Goddess be sent here?

“Sure.” Although Zhou Wen felt that the possibility of the Flower Goddess descending wasn’t high, he didn’t wish to provoke trouble if there was a better solution.

Just in case, Zhou Wen got Ice Maiden and flower girl to meet in the Chaos Bead to prevent her from escaping or sending a message to the Flower race.

Ice Maiden had the same thought. She was more afraid of something happening.

The space in the Chaos Bead was huge. The space of every item could be independent. All one could see was a chaotic fog. No matter how one traversed the chaos fog, they couldn’t really make any substantial movement. In fact, they were just going in circles.

Zhou Wen sent Ice Maiden to the flower girl. With a wave of her hand, she defrosted the ice that encased the flower girl’s body and restored her freedom.

The flower girl had remained conscious while frozen, so she knew what had happened. After being defrosted, she only looked at Ice Maiden and didn’t do anything else, much less attack her.

Ice Maiden couldn’t help but frown when she saw this.

If the flower girl had attacked immediately, that meant that she was a mere boor. That would have made it easier to deal with her.

However, from the flower girl’s expression, it was clear that she was a very calm person. Such a person was clearly even harder to deal with. Even if she verbally agreed to a reconciliation, Ice Maiden wouldn’t easily believe her.

“How may I address you?” Ice Maiden probed as she looked at the flower girl.

“Nether Lotus.” The flower girl looked at Ice Maiden and continued, “You should be an ice demon, right? As a dimensional creature, why are you opposing us by helping the humans?”

“I didn’t want to be your enemy. You initiated the attack.” Ice Maiden paused and asked, “Why did you come to Earth?”

“And why did you come to Earth?” Nether Lotus didn’t answer as she returned the question ad verbatim.

“I’m just an unimportant person among the ice demons. It’s very normal for me to be sent to Earth as cannon fodder. However, you have the Tear of the Flower Goddess. Clearly, you hold a special status in the eyes of the Flower Goddess. You shouldn’t be here,” Ice Maiden continued probing.

Nether Lotus sneered. “Is that why you don’t dare to kill me?”

“No matter how strong the Flower Goddess is, it’s difficult for her to directly interfere in Earth’s affairs. Earth isn’t as terrible as you imagine. Even if the Flower race really attacks Earth on a large scale, they might not be able to gain an advantage when the time comes. Furthermore, the Flower Goddess might not make a big fuss over you.” Ice Maiden looked at Nether Lotus and said in a serious manner, “I didn’t kill you because I’m curious why you came to such a place. This isn’t a place you should be.”

Nether Lotus wore a hesitant expression. She seemed to know that it wasn’t easy for dimensional creatures to descend to Earth. Furthermore, they were restricted by Earth’s rules. She had already experienced this herself.

Furthermore, the Flower Goddess didn’t know that she had come to Earth. If she really died here, it was difficult to say if the Flower Goddess could sense it. After all, this was Earth, an ancient forbidden land. It was very difficult for information to be transmitted.

Nether Lotus’s expression made Ice Maiden realize something, so she said, “It’s impossible for a Flower race like you to be sent to a place like Earth. There’s only one possibility. You sneaked in here yourself.”

“Who said I sneaked in? The Flower Goddess sent me to Earth for a mission,” said Nether Lotus immediately.

However, her reaction had already betrayed her. How could she deceive a shrewd person like Ice Maiden?

“Actually, we’re all the same. I came to Earth secretly just for that thing.” Ice Maiden felt relieved.

Nether Lotus looked experienced, but in fact, she was still too young. She was just pretending to be calm. She wasn’t as difficult to deal with as she imagined. She was like a flower who grew up in a greenhouse flower, one that had never experienced storms.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Nether Lotus wasn’t experienced enough, but she wasn’t retarded. It was impossible for her to be easily tricked by Ice Maiden.

Ice Maiden didn’t say anything. However, she suddenly unleashed her Ice Demon Monarch’s bloodline and transformed into an Ice Demon Queen.

“Ah! Ice Demon Monarch’s bloodline… You are the Ice Demon Monarch’s descendant… Why are you here… Could it be that you came to obtain Earth’s Companion Beasts?” Nether Lotus widened her eyes. Her understanding was the same as Ice Maiden’s. They both believed that with an identity like theirs, it was impossible for her to be sent to Earth unless there were special circumstances.

And there was only one special exception that Nether Lotus knew—it was the same reason that she had for secretly coming to Earth.
