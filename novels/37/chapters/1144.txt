Chapter 1145: Swordsman Tomorrow

The two of them saw that there were many students gathered at the venue ahead. Tsukuyomi was intrigued as she walked over.

“What are they doing?” Tsukuyomi looked at the students and asked Zhou Wen.

“Didn’t the student just say that a person named Professor Tomorrow is coming here to give a lecture?” Zhou Wen said casually.

“What do humans teach during lectures? Is it the knowledge known as science? Will it teach me how to make phones?” Tsukuyomi asked curiously.

“That might not be the case.” Although Zhou Wen didn’t know who Professor Tomorrow was, he believed that it wasn’t about scientific knowledge. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so popular.

Humans in this era were far more interested in Companion Beasts and cultivation than in scientific knowledge.

“Can we listen in too?” Tsukuyomi asked.

“Of course.” Zhou Wen found two seats and sat down with Tsukuyomi, preparing to attend Professor Tomorrow’s class.

To their surprise, after a while, the girl who had spoken to them came in. When she saw Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi, she took the initiative to walk over.

“Why are you sitting here? Doesn’t Bright Prospects College have special seats?” the girl asked the two of them in puzzlement.

“We’ll just sit here and watch,” Zhou Wen replied. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The girl looked at Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi and seemed to come to a realization. “You want to know the true evaluation our Royal College students have of you, right? Actually, you don’t have to worry. Although Bright Prospects College’s ranking isn’t high in the Federation, with an existence like Professor Tomorrow teaching there, no one dares to underestimate the students of Bright Prospects College, much less Professor Tomorrow.”

“You admire Professor Tomorrow?” Tsukuyomi’s curiosity was piqued by the girl. She now wanted to know what kind of person Professor Tomorrow was.

“Of course, everyone who uses a sword worships Professor Tomorrow. In the battle at East Sun Mountain, if Professor Tomorrow hadn’t single-handedly entered the dimensional creature tide and killed nineteen Mythical creatures, as well as the Terror creature in the lead, I’m afraid the city at the foot of East Sun Mountain would have been massacred... At the bank of Futu River, Professor Tomorrow assassinated the leader of the Guardians who presided over the Futu Conference, preventing the League of Guardians’s conspiracy from succeeding...” When the girl spoke of Professor Tomorrow’s various deeds, she described him like a god descending to the mortal world.

Zhou Wen broke out into a cold sweat for the girl when he heard that. She spent most of her time explaining how powerful Professor Tomorrow was and how many dimensional creatures he had killed.

Little did she know that Tsukuyomi, who was beside her, was a genuine dimensional creature. Furthermore, she was a virtually invincible Calamity-grade existence. She could kill her countless times with a single spit.

“In short, Professor Tomorrow is handsome, has a good temper, is extremely powerful, and is very humble. He’s practically a perfect Prince Charming. He’s the idol of many students at our school...” The girl talked non-stop about Professor Tomorrow as if she had endless praise for him.

Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled when he heard that. Professor Tomorrow could actually kill a Terror-grade creature. His strength was considered top-notch among humans.

Furthermore, from the sound of it, Professor Tomorrow didn’t seem old. He could be considered young and promising.

Tsukuyomi was also very intrigued. She waited for Professor Tomorrow’s arrival, hoping to see what kind of person he was.

The number of students at the venue gradually increased. The staff were all busy with work. In today’s society, a strong person like Professor Tomorrow was even more famous than the celebrities of yesteryear. Even Royal College didn’t dare to slight him.

The venue was almost full. Before Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi saw Professor Tomorrow, they already heard the girls scream.

“Tomorrow... Tomorrow...” The girls’ screams were like a tsunami’s roar.

The girl beside Zhou Wen also stood up and shouted ‘Tomorrow’ with the other girls. However, she was still sweeping her gaze in search. Clearly, she hadn’t seen Professor Tomorrow yet. Her vision was blocked by the person in front.

After a while, a handsome young man walked up to the podium. At this moment, the shouting reached its climax. Thankfully, this was an outdoor venue. Otherwise, the roof would have been overturned by the tsunami-like sound waves.

Tsukuyomi looked at the young man on stage with interest. When Zhou Wen saw the young man, he couldn’t help but be taken aback. This was because he actually knew Professor Tomorrow.

Strange, isn’t his name Ming Xiu? When did he change his name to Tomorrow?

Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

Five years had changed Ming Xiu from a boy to a man. He stood on the podium calmly and elegantly. He gestured with his hands and the ear-piercing screams stopped.

“Thank you for all your love and support. What would you like to hear from me?” Ming Xiu said with a smile.

“Tomorrow Sword Art...” the students said almost in unison.

Zhou Wen was taken aback again as he recalled that the name Tomorrow Sword Art was named by him.

“Professor Ming, you are known as Swordsman Tomorrow. If swordsmen aren’t talking about sword arts, are they going to teach us how to dance?” a bold male student joked.

Ming Xiu didn’t mind. He smiled and said, “This student is right. I’m a swordsman. All my life, I’ve only learned how to use a sword. The only thing I can teach you is sword arts.”

“Professor Ming, I heard that your Tomorrow Sword Art was self-created. Is it true?” another boy asked.

Ming Xiu said seriously, “Tomorrow Sword Art wasn’t independently created by me. The so-called self-creation is actually just a rumor. The reason I can master the Tomorrow Sword Art is because of two people.”

“Which two?” a student immediately asked curiously.

“Do you want to hear me tell a story or do you want to hear me talk about sword arts?” Ming Xiu said with a smile.

“Both!” Noticing Ming Xiu’s good nature, many students jested.

“Then let’s talk about sword arts first,” Ming Xiu said as he began talking about sword arts.

Ming Xiu was already one of the few sword experts in the Federation. Although most of these students came from wealthy families and had seen many experts since they were young, they still listened with relish. Many of the things Ming Xiu said were very novel and different from what they had heard in the past.

The girl beside Zhou Wen listened attentively, her eyes filled with admiration for Ming Xiu.

However, Tsukuyomi felt bored after listening for a while. The anticipation she had for Ming Xiu was completely gone.

In fact, at the level of Tsukuyomi, Ming Xiu’s realm was indeed much weaker. The things he said were completely unable to pique her interest.

“The famous Tomorrow Sword Art among humans is nothing much after all,” Tsukuyomi said to Zhou Wen.

“It’s indeed a little lacking.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.

Although Ming Xiu’s realm was considered top-notch among humans, such a realm was still inferior to Zhou Wen’s. Ming Xiu’s realm had also improved more slowly than he had expected.
