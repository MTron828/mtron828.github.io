Chapter 845: Goddess Ba

Translator: CKtalon

Previously, I was fine slashing the human face in the grave while invisible. Now, just walking over means immediate death. From the looks of it, that human face still has some tricks up its sleeve. However, it couldn’t see me the last time I went invisible, so it didn’t trigger its ability, Zhou Wen thought to himself.

It looks like it’s rather difficult to crack Fiend Tomb. The necessary Companion Beasts need Behemoth, Invisibility Cloak, and Truth Listener. If I want to kill the Guardian, I need Companion Beasts that can restrain flames. I need at least four top-notch Mythical Companion Beasts. Where would the typical person get these Companion Beasts? Even the Zhang family will probably find it difficult to have such a lineup that can perfectly counter the Mythical creatures in the Fiend Tomb.

However, I don’t think I need to fight the Guardian to resolve the Zhang family’s problem. I just need to kill the Ghoul Mask and the Ghost Hornless. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking of how to help Zhang Yuzhi, she called.

“When did you return?” Zhou Wen asked. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I just came back.” Zhang Yuzhi’s voice revealed her exhaustion before she said apologetically, “Zhou Wen, I’m sorry. I’m afraid things will change at this Earth Elemental Beast Auction.”

“Is the Earth Elemental Beast not going to be auctioned?” Zhou Wen could understand. With such a huge matter happening in the Zhang family, it would be normal for them to not be in the mood to hold an auction.

“The auction will continue and will even be held ahead of time. However, the auction this time won’t be bid using money. Whoever can resolve the problem of the Fiend Tomb can take the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg,” Zhang Yuzhi said.

“So that’s how it is. This isn’t a bad idea.” Zhou Wen was delighted. He already had a certain understanding of the Fiend Tomb. Although he wasn’t certain that he could completely resolve the problem with the Fiend Tomb, there shouldn’t be too much of a problem if he tried a few more times.

He didn’t need to kill the Guardian to resolve the Zhang family’s problem, so he was still very confident. However, he still needed to do a few dungeon runs to confirm it. After ensuring that there were no problems, it wouldn’t be too late to participate in the auction.

“I hope that someone from the other families can resolve the problem with the Fiend Tomb. Otherwise, our Zhang family will really be in danger.” Zhang Yuzhi wasn’t in a good mood. She didn’t chat with Zhou Wen for long before hanging up.

The auction will begin in two days. Time is a little tight, but it should be enough to confirm certain matters. Zhou Wen had already made up his mind to obtain the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg.

Ignoring the fact that he wanted to help Zhang Yuzhi, even if it was just for the Companion Egg, he had to take action.

However, I have to think of a way. I can’t expose my Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen thought about how to handle this matter to prevent too many Companion Beasts from being exposed.

After all, he needed to use many Companion Beasts for the endeavor. At the very least, Tyrant Behemoth, Truth Listener, and Invisibility Cloak were necessary.

When the Fiend Tomb dungeon could be launched again, Zhou Wen eagerly charged in. This time, Zhou Wen strictly adhered to the procedure.

Tyrant Behemoth dug out the grave to lure out the Ghoul Mask. Zhou Wen went invisible and approached the grave to kill the ghost face. Then, he dug out the Ghost Hornless and used Truth Listener to kill it.

The entire process went perfectly without any problems.

Then, Zhou Wen waited for a period of time. After confirming that the Fiend Stone no longer grew in copious amounts and the ghost face no longer appeared, the Companion Beasts no longer suffered Fiend Stone Petrification, nor did they walk towards the Fiend Tomb by themselves, he felt relieved.

It’s not easy for me to come here. I can’t waste it. I’ll try to see if Banana Fairy can restrain the Guardian’s flames.

Zhou Wen got Tyrant Behemoth to continue digging.

Soon, Tyrant Behemoth dug out Ba again. Just like the last time, when the veil was lifted, terrifying flames immediately burned around the Fiend Tomb.

However, this time, Banana Fairy was beside the blood-colored avatar. Just as the flames lit up, Banana Fairy parted her cherry lips and spat out the Supreme Yin Wind augmented by the Three Realms’ Best Wind.

In an instant, the flames that filled the screen vanished. The speed at which they were extinguished was as though the flames had never appeared.

Even the magma in the Fiend Tomb was wiped out by the Supreme Yin Wind and solidified into rocks.

As for the metal bed, it was sent flying by the Three Realms’ Best Wind. It tumbled into the distance and quickly became a black dot before disappearing. It was unknown how far it was sent flying, but it had already exceeded the limits of what could be seen in-game.

As expected of the Three Realms’ Best Wind. It’s too powerful! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Even the Guardian couldn’t withstand a blow from Banana Fairy. It was truly terrifying.

‘Warning... Warning... Goddess Ba transforms into her Terror form... Goddess Ba transforms into her Terror form...’ Just as Zhou Wen was feeling delighted, a red warning suddenly appeared in-game. It was like a warning siren that constantly flashed, giving people a visual sense of danger.

Terror form... What is it? Zhou Wen was momentarily taken aback. He felt that this Terror form had something to do with the Mythical stage’s Terror grade.

He remembered that the silver-haired Companion Beast had said that most Mythical creatures that appeared on Earth were likely at the Terror grade, but it hadn’t said anything about the Terror form.

Just as Zhou Wen was puzzled, he saw the scarlet flames burn half the sky red. A red figure that resembled a ghost god tore through the air at an unbelievable speed.

Wherever the red figure went, everything around it turned into flames. Even the air and mountains burned.

As he was extremely far away, Zhou Wen didn’t manage to see the figure clearly at first. However, she came too quickly and could be seen in the blink of an eye. It was likely Goddess Ba, but the current Goddess Ba was very different from before.

Now, Goddess Ba’s entire body was burning with terrifying flames. These flames weren’t burning outside her body, but through her entire body. Every inch of her muscles, every bone, and every tiny cell seemed to be burning with blood-red flames.

It was as if her entire body was condensed from flames. Her hair was like fire threads, and her eyes were like fire pupils. She was like a fire demoness that had walked out of a myth, emitting a terrifying and dangerous aura. Due to her arrival, the entire valley burned. The river instantly dried up, and the ground was red like purgatory.

Zhou Wen could sense that the power in her body was unimaginably terrifying. It was something he had never seen on any creature or Companion Beast.

Tyrant Behemoth roared as it soared into the sky. Its huge fist struck at the levitating Goddess Ba. With the augmentation of Absolute Strength, its strike could shatter mountains.

However, Goddess Ba only looked coldly at Tyrant Behemoth without any intention of attacking. Tyrant Behemoth’s terrifying strike failed to touch her body. It didn’t even break the flames outside the Goddess Ba’s body as invisible flames held back its fist.
