Chapter 1783 Appearance

“If you’re worried, come back and do it yourself. Stop yapping.” Li Xuan sneered.

Zhou Wen smiled. “Who the f*ck doesn’t want to return? But if I don’t return, guard Guide Ancient City if you can. If not, there’s no need to force it. You have to survive.”

“If you know that survival is important, think of every possible way to return. Back then, we agreed to build a city together. The city is now here, and so am I, so you better f*cking return here,” Li Xuan said as he stared at Zhou Wen.

“What if…” Zhou Wen wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by Li Xuan.

“There’s no what-if. It’s easy to abandon the city, but where can we go?” Li Xuan asked in response.

Zhou Wen was slightly stunned before he smiled. “That’s true. Where can you retreat to?”

“It’s good that you understand. Make sure to return. The city exists with you around.” Li Xuan’s tone was relaxed, but his word was worth its weight in gold.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen stared at Li Xuan for a moment before nodding and walking out.

Just as he walked out of the courtyard, he saw a graceful figure standing beside the stone path. She was leaning against an ancient wall and looking at Zhou Wen.

“Yuzhi…” Zhou Wen was slightly stunned when he saw Zhang Yuzhi.

“Are you leaving?” Zhang Yuzhi asked Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen nodded slightly and didn’t say anything. In fact, he didn’t know what to say.

“Can you not go?” she asked again.

......

“There are certain things that will eat at you your entire life if you don’t do them,” Zhou Wen said. Zhang Yuzhi stared at Zhou Wen and didn’t say a word. After a while, she suddenly walked in front of Zhou Wen, spread her arms, hugged him, and whispered into his ear, “Come back.”

With that said, she released her grip and left without waiting for Zhou Wen’s answer.

Zhou Wen stared blankly as Zhang Yuzhi’s figure went into the distance. When she reached the corner of the street, Zhang Yuzhi suddenly turned around and smiled brightly. “When you return, let’s visit Mount Dragon Tiger.”

As he watched the beautiful figure turn the corner and disappear, Zhou Wen didn’t understand why Zhang Yuzhi wanted him to visit Mount Dragon Tiger.

After some thought, he threw all his thoughts to the back of his mind and headed for the Cube.

He originally wanted to make a trip to Luoyang to visit Ya’er, Ouyang Lan, and his father—who he hadn’t talked much with.

However, he didn’t go in the end. He was a person who didn’t like partings. If he really couldn’t return, he hoped that he would be quickly forgotten and no longer be missed. The Cube kept showing the scene of the divine mountain. Wang Mingyuan, Zhong Ziya, and Jiang Yan were chained to the white jade pillars in front of the temple. The Transcendent Immortal was in the temple and couldn’t be seen.

“Professor Gu, in your opinion, is it possible for Human Sovereign to defeat Transcendent Immortal if he fights?” Su Yi asked on the live broadcast.

She had always trusted Human Sovereign and firmly believed that Human Sovereign was the strongest human. If it were in the past, she definitely wouldn’t have asked such a question. However, Transcendent Immortal was too strong, so strong that it left her in despair. Even a powerhouse like Human Sovereign couldn’t give her a sufficient sense of security.

“An Apocalypse grade. That’s a gap that humans can’t cross at present.” Professor Gu didn’t answer Su Yi directly, but his meaning was obvious. The people watching the live broadcast were very unhappy with this sentence, but they had to admit that there was nothing wrong with Professor Gu’s words.

From the looks of it, there was no Apocalypse-grade existence among humans. Nobody even knew how to reach the Apocalypse grade.

Even existences like Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan —who had used everything they had and even their lives-couldn’t withstand a single blow from Transcendent Immortal. The difference in strength was despairing.

Su Yi lost interest in talking for a moment, causing the live broadcast to fall silent.

As a professional host, she shouldn’t have let such a situation happen. However, she really couldn’t bring herself to speak. She felt a deep sense of powerlessness.

Suddenly, the Cube’s still screen stirred as a figure appeared on the divine mountain.

“Zhou Wen?” Su Yi couldn’t help but exclaim when she saw the figure on the screen clearly.

After two human powerhouses suffered a crushing defeat, Zhou Wen actually appeared on the divine mountain at this moment. It gave them an ominous feeling.

“Why did you choose such a time?” Professor Gu couldn’t help but frown.

Everyone knew very well that there was probably no existence among humans that could resist Transcendent Immortal. Jiang Yan and Zhong Ziya’s two battles had already made everyone realize this clearly.

It didn’t seem like a good choice to rashly fight Transcendent Immortal now.

“Too rash… Too rash… Be it Zhong Ziya or Jiang Yan, as long as they can wait two more years, even if it’s only one year, such elites might very well grow to the point of fighting Transcendent Immortal. But now, they have sacrificed themselves for nothing. Now, Zhou Wen has gone as well… He’s really too young… Too rash… Sigh…” Professor Gu found it a pity and was even a little angry, having expected better from Zhou Wen.

It was indeed as he said. If Zhou Wen had waited a year or two, he might have full confidence in defeating Transcendent Immortal. But what was the point of winning when the time came?

Doing the right things at the right time was one thing, but some things couldn’t be repeated for the rest of their lives once they were missed.

Zhou Wen walked up the divine mountain step by step and arrived in front of the temple. He stared at Zhong Ziya, Jiang Yan, and Wang Mingyuan-who were chained to the white jade pillars.

His heart couldn’t help but sink when he saw Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan clearly.

Through the Cube, he couldn’t determine if the two of them had completely lost their lives. Therefore, Zhou Wen still had a sliver of hope that they still had a chance of survival.

But after observing them at close range, Zhou Wen’s heart turned cold. They had indeed completely lost their lives, and it was impossible for them to be revived.

On the other hand, Wang Mingyuan still had life in him and wasn’t weak. His injuries weren’t as serious as imagined.

“You’re finally here.” Transcendent Immortal’s voice sounded as she walked out of the temple.

“Someone has to collect the debt owed.” Zhou Wen sized up Transcendent Immortal as he spoke.

“How do you want to collect it?” Transcendent Immortal asked calmly.

“Blood for blood.” Zhou Wen’s gaze was like a blade as he stared at Transcendent Immortal. He walked forward slowly, and stars appeared around him. In an instant, it was as if all the stars in the sky were shining brightly.

As Zhou Wen advanced, the stars in the sky turned into straight shooting stars that rushed at Transcendent Immortal. The densely packed light swords streaked across the void like a torrent and overlapped as they attacked Transcendent Immortal.

There was no extreme speed or infinite variations, just pure suppression of strength.

A human competing in strength with the Apocalypse-grade Transcendent Immortal? Will that work? The watching humans were filled with doubts.
