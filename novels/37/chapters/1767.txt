Chapter 1768 Three-Eyed Gods

Zhou Wen looked at the black object below and frowned slightly. Before he could do anything, the Demonic Sword in Demonic Neonate’s arms automatically flew out again.

The tiny Demonic Sword charged straight at the roots of the golden fruit tree and plunged in with a plop.

The Demonic Sword penetrated the hard golden fruit tree as it charged in like a drill and vanished in the blink of an eye. There was only a cracking sound coming from the hole as well as spewing powder.

When did the Demonic Sword’s offensive strength become so strong? Zhou Wen was alarmed.

When Demonic Neonate first obtained the Demonic Sword, the Demonic Sword’s strength wasn’t that powerful. It now had such powerful strength. The golden fruit tree that even the Calamity-grade Imperial Lord Behemoth couldn’t damage was easily penetrated by the Demonic Sword. This was just the Demonic Sword’s strength, not Demonic Neonate’s strength augmenting it.

From the looks of it, the power of the Demonic Sword can grow with Demonic Neonate’s growth. Zhou Wen was very envious of Demonic Neonate’s ability.

Zhou Wen was only envious, but the spectators were already shocked speechless. The destructive power displayed by the Demonic Sword was unbelievable. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Boom!

Before long, there was a loud boom. The golden fruit tree that was rooted in the black matter began to crack from its roots. The entire tree collapsed and fell to the ground.

After the golden fruit tree collapsed, a pitch-black hole appeared where it originally was. It led straight down, but there was no end in sight. It was pitch-black like a bottomless abyss.

Could it be that I found the key to this dimensional zone by chance? Zhou Wen was alarmed. He had dug the tree to stall for time, but to his surprise, he had discovered something

“So there’s a whole different world beneath the golden fruit tree. Zhou Wen’s digging of the tree really has a deeper meaning. Professor Gu, what do you think will be inside the hole?” Su Yi completely misunderstood Zhou Wen’s intentions, but her view was shared by most people. Everyone believed that Zhou Wen had long determined the existence of the underground cave.

“I don’t know. Everything is unknown,” Professor Gu said with a heavy expression. “If we had those alien races as a reference during the earlier attempts, everything that Zhou Wen is encountering now is unknown. The difficulty is completely different from before. I only hope that he can return safely.”

Many people watching the program stared nervously at the scene. Just as Professor Gu had said, every step Zhou Wen took was a challenge of the unknown. It was even more nerve-racking than the battles with expected outcomes.

Zhou Wen glanced at the hole and didn’t plan on entering. He was just stalling for time. He had to wait for the download of the phone dungeon to be completed.

He didn’t move, but Demonic Neonate moved. She jumped into the bottomless abyss. Zhou Wen was alarmed but it was too late to summon her back.

After Demonic Neonate jumped into the hole, her connection with him was immediately severed. He could only sense Demonic Neonate’s existence, but she couldn’t transmit any information.

After some thought, Zhou Wen summoned Imperial Lord Behemoth and jumped in.

With his understanding of Demonic Neonate, she probably wouldn’t be stupid enough to send herself to her death. There might not be the imagined danger down there.

“That punk… He’s a brainless boor…” An Tianzuo nearly exploded from anger. It was equivalent to tempting fate by not doing the most basic reconnaissance or probes before jumping in.

An Sheng didn’t dare say a word. He didn’t know how to explain Zhou Wen’s actions which were simply too rash.

“Sigh, he’s still too young. He was blinded by his previous successes. He didn’t even do the basic reconnaissance work and jumped in just like that.” Professor Gu couldn’t help but sigh and shake his head.

This time, even many of Professor Gu’s haters felt that what he said made sense. It looked like Zhou Wen had made a very rash choice.

How could they know that Zhou Wen had no choice? He couldn’t let Demonic Neonate take the risk herself.

As Zhou Wen jumped into the hole, the Cube’s screen plunged into darkness. It lasted for a long time before it suddenly lit up.

As the light was too blinding, people’s eyes couldn’t immediately adapt to it. All they felt was a blinding light in front of them, preventing them from seeing anything. It took a while for their eyes to gradually adapt to the dazzling light before they gradually saw the scene clearly.

The scene that entered their vision was shocking. It was a huge palace that was many times bigger than a human palace. Every pillar was a thousand feet tall and the various artifacts were shockingly large. Even the steps in the palace were more than ten meters tall.

At the end of the stairs was a throne that was nearly a hundred meters tall. On it was a humanoid creature wrapped in golden armor.

The creature looked like a human, but its body was far bigger than a human’s.

In front of this huge palace and creature, Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate were as tiny as ants. Even the humans watching the battle through the livestream couldn’t help but feel extremely tiny.

Suddenly, the golden giant on the throne opened its eyes. Its eyes were blue like the sea, and on its forehead was a vertical eye with a golden pupil. Its three eyes stared coldly at Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate like a god was looking down at mortals.

The average person felt that the golden-armored giant’s aura was shocking, like a god or devil. However, the dimensional powerhouses watching the battle were alarmed and nearly cried out.

“Three-Eyed Gods!” Trajectory Seeking’s composure was clearly inferior to those old monsters as she blurted out.

“What Three-Eyed Gods?” Li Xuan asked her.

“That’s the legendary Gods that vanished overnight. That golden vertical eye is the proof of the Gods’ noble bloodline. I never expected the Gods to still remain… There are even pure-blooded Gods that live in this world…” Trajectory Seeking continued with a complicated expression, “Zhou Wen probably won’t be able to return.”

“There’s nothing impressive about the races in the dimension. It’s not like Old Zhou hasn’t killed one before. What’s so impressive about the Gods?” Li Xuan curled his lips.

“What do you know? Having a golden vertical eye represents the noblest bloodline of the Gods. They are born powerhouses and possess unparalleled strength. They are extremely rare existences among the Gods. They are existences that can fight many of the strongest alien races. How can a mere human fight them? Zhou Wen is dead,” Trajectory Seeking said with certainty.

“Don’t tell me you want to say that that thing is at the Apocalypse grade?” Li Xuan asked with a trembling voice.

“It’s not just the Apocalypse grade. Even among the Apocalypse-grade creatures, the Three-Eyed Gods are the strongest existences. Back then, it was an existence that could fight the Immortals at their peak…” Trajectory Seeking sighed.
