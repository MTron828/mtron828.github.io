Chapter 1544: Humans Who Worship the Devil King

Translator: CKtalon

“Jiuyang, well done.” Xiao looked at Jiuyang who walked out of the Cube and greeted him with a smile.

“That’s no need for compliments. Even a pig can accomplish such a feat while wearing this Solar Holy Armor,” Jiuyang said coldly.

“You can’t say that. There are so many Saints in the Sun God Holy Temple. Only you were chosen to possess it. That’s your strength,” Xiao said.

Jiuyang’s expression didn’t change. “There’s nothing to be happy about. My opponents aren’t them to begin with. I only want to defeat Human Sovereign. Do you think Human Sovereign will appear this time?”

“Probably. Since he claims to be Human Sovereign, he’s not likely to sit back and watch us obtain the Dubhe Companion Beast,” Xiao said.

“That’s good.” After saying that, Jiuyang turned around and left, ignoring Xiao.

Seeing Jiuyang leave, Xiao sighed softly and muttered to himself, “I hope that fellow doesn’t go. Jiuyang and the Guardian on him are practically invincible in a place like Dubhe.”

Zhou Wen, who was grinding, suddenly sneezed. He wiped his nose and muttered to himself, “Ya’er must be missing me. It’s been so long since I went back to visit her. I wonder how she’s doing.”

Before Zhou Wen could find a way to kill Starlord Titan Gate and continue grinding, he heard screams and shouts coming from the city.

What’s happening??Zhou Wen turned his attention and immediately detected a huge snake that was as red as fire in Regretless City. It slithered across the streets and roofs, opened its mouth, and swallowed a human.

This is the Devil Snake they mentioned, right?

?Zhou Wen immediately thought of the information Grim Demon had previously obtained.

As the snake was at the Terror grade, the humans in Regretless City couldn’t see it after its Terror transformation. They could only be devoured by it.

Many people knelt on the ground and loudly prayed to the Devil King instead of God.

Seeing that the snake still wanted to devour more people, Zhou Wen instant transmitted over. He held the summoned Golden Wyrm Scissors in his hand and snipped the snake into two.

Splash! Splash!

After the snake died, its body exited its Terror form and fell to the ground. Large amounts of snake blood dyed the nearby streets red as though it had just rained blood.

“Your Devilish Excellency… Long live…” When people saw the snake corpse and Zhou Wen floating in the air, they immediately knelt towards him like pious believers, thanking him for saving their lives.

They seemed to be certain that Zhou Wen was Lost Paradise’s Devil King.

Zhou Wen didn’t wish to explain. He searched the snake corpse and found an Essence Energy Crystal.

There are Essence Energy Crystals in dimensional creatures as well? Then, could there be Companion Eggs??Zhou Wen suddenly had the urge to kill all the dimensional bigwigs to see if he could find Companion Eggs.

Zhou Wen was just musing. At the very least, he wasn’t in the mood to experiment.

The humans only dared to get up after he returned to the cemetery. They looked at each other with mixed expressions.

…

Not long after Zhou Wen returned to the cemetery—before he could even take out his phone—he saw Grim Demon fly back.

“What happened?” Zhou Wen sized up Grim Demon and couldn’t help but frown when he realized that he was injured in several places.

“I’m fine. That snake didn’t get the better of me either.” Grim Demon recounted his experience.

There was indeed a red snake in the mountain range behind Regretless City. Furthermore, there were many of them. Grim Demon wanted to visit somewhere further away, but after a few roundabouts, he was still discovered by the red snake.

The average red snake was naturally not Grim Demon’s match. Grim Demon even killed those at the same Terror grade. However, when a Calamity-grade red snake appeared, Grim Demon had no choice but to escape.

“These red snakes are extraordinary. They must be related to the legendary Satan. Their bodies are much stronger than the typical creature at the same level,” Grim Demon said.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he suddenly realized that the elder had arrived outside the cemetery with a few people.

“Your Devilish Excellency… I wish to seek an audience…” the elder said respectfully after knocking on the door.

“What are you doing here?” Zhou Wen walked to the door and opened it.

The elder hurriedly led the humans beside him to kneel and kowtow. After kowtowing, he pointed at the two girls beside him and said, “Your Devilish Excellency, these are the most beautiful girls in our city. I hope you like them.”

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen looked at the two girls beside the elder. They looked to be about seventeen or eighteen years old. They were extremely beautiful. Their noses were high and their big eyes were deep. They had West District features.

With long brownish-red hair, they exuded a different charm.

What was even more shocking was that the two girls looked identical. They were twins.

“Your Devilish Excellency, you have protected our Regretless City for so many years, preventing us from being harmed by creatures from the outside world. We only wish to repay you. Your Devilish Excellency, you haven’t brought any maids with you. That must be very inconvenient for you. If there’s anything you need, just instruct them…” the elder said.

“There’s no need.” Zhou Wen rejected it immediately. What day and age was it? Humans weren’t inferior to anyone. There was no need for them to kneel to others.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that the two girls would be happy that they didn’t have to serve him, but to his surprise, their faces turned pale when they heard his rejection.

One of the girls rushed forward and hugged Zhou Wen’s calf. “Your Devilish Excellency, please let us follow you. Do as you wish. Leave everything to us. Even if you want us dead, we will be absolutely willing. If you don’t like us, take our lives. We are willing to do anything for you…”

Looking at the sincere girl who looked like a crazy fangirl, Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless.

From the determined looks in the two girls’ eyes, they would immediately commit suicide if Zhou Wen didn’t let them stay.

“Leave the two of them behind. You are dismissed,” Zhou Wen said to the elder.

“Your Devilish Excellency, rest well. I won’t disturb you any further.” Only then did the elder relax. He didn’t dare look up as he kept his head lowered and bowed before leaving the cemetery. He even closed the door behind him.

“What are your names?” Zhou Wen asked as he sized up the two girls.

“I’m Liz. She’s my younger sister, Leem,” the girl who had hugged Zhou Wen’s leg pointed at her sister.

“What can you do?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“Your Devilish Excellency, we can do anything you instruct us to do,” Liz and Leem said at the same time with their heads lowered.. Their cheeks were abnormally red.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
