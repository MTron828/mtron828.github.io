Chapter 1679 My Adversary Has Never Been Humanity

“You aren’t killing me?” Mohe asked in surprise. He never expected Zhou Wen to get someone to take him back and not kill him.

Others might be afraid of the Family Clan of Gods’ faction and wouldn’t dare attack him because of their qualms, but Mohe knew very well that the An family had no intention of compromising with the Family Clan of Gods. Even if the An family was willing to compromise, an existence like Zhou Wen didn’t need to worry about the Family Clan of Gods.

“Why should I kill you?” Zhou Wen asked calmly.

Mohe was first taken aback before saying, “Because I’m your enemy now.”

“My enemies have never been humans.” With that said, Zhou Wen turned around and walked towards Honn Shinsakura.

Looking at Zhou Wen’s back, Mohe’s expression changed constantly. He kept thinking about Zhou Wen’s words: “My enemies have never been humans.” He didn’t know what to feel.

Honn Shinsakura got two disciples to take Mohe back before leading the remaining disciples to Guide Ancient City with Zhou Wen.

The Elders who were unwilling to migrate to Guide Ancient City were now overjoyed. They would occasionally appear in front of Zhou Wen and greet him Mr. Zhou warmly.

Zhou Wen was in a rather good mood. He originally imagined that it would be a tiring trip that wasted his time, but he never expected to find a way to advance the Teacher Domain. He was already planning to try it on Feng Qiuyan, Ming Xiu, and Qin Zhen to see if he could raise the Teacher Domain to the Heaven level when he returned.

He used spatial teleportation abilities on his trip here. It didn’t take much time, but when he returned, he had to slowly travel with more than ten thousand disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. It wasn’t that fast.

As the route they chose was relatively safe, they didn’t encounter much trouble along the way. Zhou Wen didn’t even need to take action to resolve the minor problems they encountered. Honn Shinsakura and company resolved them themselves, so Zhou Wen had nothing to do. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He wanted to grind the game dungeons, but his phone was still charging. There was no way to operate it.

The charging took longer than Zhou Wen had anticipated. After more than fifty hours, the phone’s battery finally reached 99%. It was just short of the final 1%.

Zhou Wen held his phone and waited for the final 1% to be completed. He was very curious about the difference after the phone was charged up.

Ordinary phones were charged for extended usage, but the mysterious phone had no need for that. Changes were definitely in stall from the charging.

Ding! With a notification sound, the battery reached 100%. As Zhou Wen waited in anticipation, the phone screen finally changed.

The battery icon vanished and the screen turned black. A line of white words appeared in the middle of the screen.

“Fully charged. Restarting system…”

Restart? Why isn’t it an upgrade? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. He imagined that there would be a tremendous change, but he never expected it to only be a restart.

The phone didn’t make Zhou Wen wait too long. After a while, the line of words vanished. The phone screen lit up again and entered the familiar home screen.

Looking at the familiar scene, Zhou Wen swiped his finger a few times, but he didn’t discover any obvious differences. Even the background was the same. The icon of every game dungeon was identical.

Don’t tell me this thing is really just charging for extended usage? Zhou Wen was depressed. After all this trouble, it really didn’t seem any different.

He flipped it back and forth several times. Apart from the game dungeon icons representing dungeons that had already been downloaded, nothing had increased. No matter how he looked at it, it was identical to before.

Unwilling to give up, he studied it for a while longer before he was completely disappointed. The mysterious phone hadn’t changed at all.

Are you messing with me? Zhou Wen felt depressed, but there was nothing he could do. He randomly opened the Ant City dungeon. Having not grinded dungeons for a few days, he planned on grinding the dungeon to see if he could obtain anything useful. I wonder if the drop rate will be higher after it’s fully charged. It can’t be completely useless, right? Zhou Wen thought to himself as he suddenly froze when he saw the Ant City dungeon.

After clicking on the icon, he didn’t enter the game like before. Instead, two options appeared.

Normal mode… Hidden mode… I knew it was impossible for there to be no changes… Could this be the legendary hidden dungeon? Zhou Wen was immediately overjoyed when he saw the two options. He chose the hidden mode without any hesitation.

In the past, there would always be some hidden places. Even if one cleared the game, it was very likely that they wouldn’t discover the hidden mysterious dungeons. Typically, one had to use special methods to enter.

Hidden dungeons often had all sorts of hidden bosses and treasures. There might even be a drop rate that was much higher than ordinary dungeons.

Zhou Wen only imagined the scene of him casually killing a few dimensional creatures after entering a hidden dungeon and having Companion Eggs and Essence Energy Crystals drop. He couldn’t contain his excitement.

If he was lucky, he might be able to drop a divine artifact just by killing a monster. Just the thought of it was thrilling.

The Ant City dungeon was a dungeon that came with the phone. It was also the first dungeon Zhou Wen had come into contact with. However, Zhou Wen had yet to kill the Guardian of Ant City.

This Guardian could actually become stronger and stronger with time. This was considered a unique existence.

After entering Ant City, the game screen didn’t seem to change. The ant-type dimensional creatures didn’t show any signs of becoming stronger. With Zhou Wen’s present strength, he could easily kill a large group with one strike.

Soon, he arrived at the ant nest. Just as Zhou Wen was about to rush into the huge hive where the Golden Ant King was, he suddenly saw a strange glow appear on the game screen.

Although it was called Ant City, it was actually a huge cave with many ant nests inside. In the past, Zhou Wen had always cleared the ant nests before fighting the Ant City Guardian.

The layout of the cave and the ant nest didn’t change, but at the deepest part of the cave, there was a mountain wall that shimmered with golden light.

Zhou Wen looked carefully and realized that there was a protruding rock on the shimmering mountain wall. The rock was only the size of a palm and it curved slightly. The color and texture were no different from ordinary rocks.

If not for the fact that the rock was glowing with golden light, Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t have noticed it no matter how many times he came.

Zhou Wen stopped provoking the ant colony in Ant City. He summoned the Invisibility Cloak and wore it. He secretly came in front of the golden rocks and reached out to touch them.

The rock itself didn’t seem strange. It was no different from the rocks beside it. It was unlikely to be a treasure.

Zhou Wen attempted to explore. When he exerted strength with his hand to attempt spinning the rock, it began moving. Then, there was a grinding sound as the rock sank into the mountain wall. Then, a crack that could allow a person to pass opened up on the mountain wall.
