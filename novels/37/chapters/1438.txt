Chapter 1439: A Gift for Pandora

It was rather normal inside Pandora’s Magic Palace. At the very least, Zhou Wen didn’t discover any problems.

The dimensional creatures that appeared were things Zhou Wen had read about on the Internet. There was nothing abnormal about them.

The program team recorded and compared some places where humans often went. They wanted to prove that nothing abnormal had happened to Magic Palace.

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan followed them as they filmed. At noon, they finished filming about four places that people often went.

When the program team was having lunch, Liu Yun, who was disguised as a videographer, found an opportunity to come to Zhou Wen’s side. He said with a smile, “Mr. Zhou, the scenery over there is pretty good. Do you want me to take a picture for you?”

When he came close to Zhou Wen, he whispered, “Follow me.”

“Alright.” Zhou Wen pulled Ya’er to the side.

After leaving the production team, Liu Yun gritted his teeth and said, “Why are you following me?”

“What do you mean why am I following you? Didn’t you ask me to take a picture?” Zhou Wen feigned surprise.

“Cut the act. Leave quickly. Don’t cause trouble here.” Liu Yun was a sharp person. He knew that Zhou Wen had definitely recognized him.

“Why should I leave? This isn’t your house,” Zhou Wen said calmly.

Liu Yun was helpless against Zhou Wen. All he could do was restrain his temper and say, “I’ll tell you the truth. It’s now very dangerous in Pandora’s Magic Palace. Pandora’s box can open at any time. When that happens, the whole of Magic Palace will be breached. A terrifying Calamity creature will appear. If something goes wrong, there won’t even be a chance to escape.”

“Were you the one who spread the rumors?” Zhou Wen asked casually.

“It’s not a rumor. It’s the truth.” Liu Yun wore a sincere expression.

“I can see for myself if it’s a rumor. After observing the area for so long, why haven’t I discovered any signs of the magic box opening?” Zhou Wen said calmly.

Liu Yun tried his best to explain, “Pandora’s box is sealed. There will naturally be no warning signs when it isn’t opened. After it opens, it will be too late to leave. I spread the news ahead of time to give ordinary people a chance to escape. Otherwise, anyone in New De City would die. Ordinary people won’t have a chance of escaping.”

“Why are you here since it’s so dangerous?” Zhou Wen remained unmoved as he asked with a smile.

“I’m just trying to get rid of the scourge for the people. I plan on investigating the situation first. If the conditions allow it, I’ll think of a way to permanently seal the magic box before it opens.” Liu Yun looked like he was baring his heart. “Junior Brother, listen to me. Take the child and leave quickly. It’d be fine if you were alone. I can’t watch you take the child to such a dangerous place.”

“Eldest Senior Brother, you actually have such noble thoughts. You are virtually a hero who acts in the interest of the country and its citizens. It’s really impressive. Forget it. As your junior brother, I can’t hold you back. I’ll do as you say,” Zhou Wen said.

“That’s more like it. Take Li Xuan with you and quickly return to Luoyang…” Liu Yun was immediately overjoyed when he saw how easy it was to convince Zhou Wen.

“No, what I mean is to do as you say. I’ll go with you and see if we can seal the magic box before it opens…” Zhou Wen said.

Liu Yun’s smile gradually froze. In the end, his face turned livid. He pointed at Zhou Wen and said fiercely, “Do you have to make things difficult for me?”

“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered with certainty.

Liu Yun pointed at Zhou Wen with a ferocious expression. He wagged his finger a few times and looked like he was about to kill him when he suddenly retracted his hand. He forced a smile and said, “Junior Brother, we are all fellow disciples. Why make things difficult for one of your own? Go back now. I’ll treat you to a feast when I’m in Luoyang.”

“I want half,” Zhou Wen said directly, ignoring him.

“Half what?” Liu Yun said blankly.

“60%,” Zhou Wen said directly.

“Junior Brother, I really…” Before Liu Yun could finish his sentence, Zhou Wen opened his mouth, prepared to raise the price again.

When Liu Yun saw the shape of Zhou Wen’s mouth, he knew that he was about to say 70. He hurriedly interrupted, “Half it is, but you have to work for it.”

“How do I work for it?” Zhou Wen asked.

Liu Yun looked at the production crew and saw that no one was paying attention to them. Therefore, he lowered his voice and said, “The opening of the magic box is true. I’m not lying. I spread the news because I really want to help them. I don’t want them to die without knowing why.”

Seeing Zhou Wen look at him in disbelief, Liu Yun said helplessly, “Alright, I admit that part of the reason I sent them away was for this operation, but I also want to save their lives. This is an undeniable fact.”

“Get to the point,” Zhou Wen said impatiently.

“Have you heard of the legend of Pandora?” Liu Yun asked.

“Isn’t that obvious? Has anyone not heard of it? Even a three-year-old knows the legend of the magic box,” Zhou Wen said.

“Pandora’s box was something that happened later. Before Pandora’s box, the gods gave some gifts to her. Do you know what they were?” Liu Yun whispered.

“I don’t know.” Zhou Wen only knew of such a myth, but he didn’t know the exact details.

“Prometheus stole fire from the sun and gave it to humans, bringing light to humans. In order to punish humans, the gods used a Goddess as a blueprint to create a beautiful woman, Pandora. The Goddess of Love and Beauty gave her a mesmerizing perfume. Athena gave her a silvery gown, the Fire God gave her a sash, necklaces, rings, and other divine items. Hermes gave her the gift of language, making her the most perfect woman in the world…” As Liu Yun spoke, his drool was about to drip out.

Wiping the corner of his mouth, Liu Yun continued, “Think about it. Those divine clothes, ribbons, necklaces, rings, and so on are all true divine items. They aren’t the calamity in the magic box. According to my speculation, I’m certain that Pandora is at the Calamity grade. Then, the things on her must be good things at the Calamity grade. If I can get them all…”

“That’s not right. You want to kill a Calamity-grade creature?” Zhou Wen felt that there was something wrong with Liu Yun’s words.

“Not kill, steal,” Liu Yun corrected.

“The things on a Calamity creature are one with her. How can you steal them?” Zhou Wen found it unreliable.

“That might not be the case. If it were an ordinary Calamity creature, it might be the case. However, it’s different for Pandora. She’s just a tool that was created. Those things were given to her by the gods. They aren’t things that she comes with. I should be able to steal them,” Liu Yun said.

Zhou Wen frowned inwardly. He had a nagging feeling that things weren’t as simple as Liu Yun had said.

“If you want to steal something, do it yourself. Why did you sneak into the program team?” Zhou Wen stared at Liu Yun and asked.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
