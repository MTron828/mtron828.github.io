Chapter 1311: Zhang Chunqiu’s Request

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen kept smiling as though he didn’t care what Zhang Yuzhi said.

In fact, Zhou Wen basically couldn’t hear Zhang Yuzhi. Along the way, he tried to get used to the world’s sounds Truth Listener brought to him.

However, this was just too difficult. Ignoring the fact that he could receive all kinds of the sounds, Zhou Wen could only occasionally hear the right channels even if it was a sound coming from right in front of him.

When he listened to Zhang Yuzhi, it was basically two parts listening and seven parts guessing. The other ten percent was completely wrong, so he kept messing up Zhang Yuzhi’s instructions.

With his control over his powers, even if he didn’t know any gardening, he wouldn’t have made so many mistakes.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that Zhang Yuzhi would be angry at his actions. After all, it was obvious that she had put in a lot of effort into this garden. Every blade of grass and tree looked ordinary, but they were actually carefully selected.

However, although Zhang Yuzhi kept nagging at Zhou Wen, she wasn’t really angry. Instead, she patiently told him what to do. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

However, as Zhou Wen could barely understand half of it despite listening and guessing, he appeared very clumsy. Zhang Yuzhi often repeated it a few times, but Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out what to do.

Zhang Yuzhi wasn’t in a rush. She seemed to treat teaching the clumsy Zhou Wen how to garden and her nagging as a form of enjoyment.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush either. After all, he had to practice adapting to the abilities Truth Listener had given him. However, he felt somewhat embarrassed doing something at odds with the instructions.

That day, Zhou Wen didn’t do anything but help Zhang Yuzhi with the garden.

In fact, it should be said that he was destroying the garden. Zhou Wen couldn’t understand the instructions, so he made many mistakes. For example, the water that should have been poured at the roots ended up being poured on the leaves. Although it wasn’t a big deal, there were many mistakes. The originally perfect and immaculate garden lost a little of its luster.

Despite knowing this, Zhang Yuzhi refused to do it herself. She continued commanding Zhou Wen.

Only when the sun went down and Zhang Chunqiu called them for dinner did Zhang Yuzhi let Zhou Wen off.

Although Zhou Wen kept trying to listen and speak less, Zhang Chunqiu and Zhang Yuzhi were extremely smart. They could naturally tell that Zhou Wen’s hearing was problematic.

However, since Zhou Wen didn’t say anything, they didn’t ask. They continued chatting with Zhou Wen with a smile. Even if Zhou Wen’s answer didn’t seem to make sense, they would still continue chatting as though they hadn’t discovered his abnormality.

“It’s getting late. I should take my leave.” After eating, Zhou Wen planned on returning to Luoyang.

“No way. The garden work isn’t done yet. Are you leaving just like that? Are you giving up halfway?” Zhang Yuzhi said with widened eyes.

Even though Zhou Wen didn’t hear what Zhang Yuzhi said, he could tell what she had said from her expression.

Zhou Wen realized that not being able to hear what the other party said wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. Some people said that if one closed their eyes and listened to this world, they would discover many beautiful things that had been neglected in the past.

In fact, it was the same the other way around. Without sound, it was impossible to hear the other party’s words. Without the modification of words, one could only silently look with their eyes and discover many things that were previously difficult to discover.

Human expressions and body language are interesting. Zhou Wen realized that he easily ignored the other party’s emotions in the past. He only determined the other party’s thoughts from their words.

Now, he realized that many times, words could lie, but the emotions of the body language’s reaction didn’t lie.

While he couldn’t hear the other party’s words, Zhou Wen’s ability to read body language rapidly improved.

“I can’t stay here forever to help you take care of the garden, right?” Zhou Wen said.

Being able to read someone’s emotions didn’t mean that Zhou Wen’s EQ improved. In fact, reading and understanding were two different matters.

“At the very least, you have to correct the parts you destroyed, right?” Zhang Yuzhi said.

Zhou Wen heard that. After some thought, he felt that it made sense. He was clearly here to help, but he had ended up wrecking the garden. It wasn’t nice.

“Alright, let’s continue tomorrow.” Zhou Wen thought to himself that he had roughly learned the gardening trade. It wouldn’t take long tomorrow to correct everything.

Zhang Yuzhi didn’t feel well, so Zhang Chunqiu got someone to take her back to rest after the meal.

“Don’t try to go back on your words and run away.” Before leaving, Zhang Yuzhi turned her head and teased Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen didn’t hear what she was saying, nor could he guess what her expression meant. All he could do was respond with a smile.

Zhang Yuzhi burst into a peal of laughter before turning to leave.

Zhou Wen was helpless. He didn’t know what Zhang Yuzhi was talking about, much less what she was laughing at. He felt like a fool.

“I’ll take you to your guest room.” After Zhang Chunqiu took Zhou Wen to the guest room, he didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he sat down beside the table.

Zhang Chunqiu extended his index finger, dipped it into the teacup, and wrote: “Zhou Wen, do you need help?”

“Thank you. I’m fine. I’ll recover after some time.” Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised. It would be strange if Zhang Chunqiu couldn’t tell.

“I do have something that I really need your help with.” Zhang Chunqiu wrote solemnly.

“Could it be that the Fiend Tomb’s situation is very bad?” Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly asked.

Zhang Chunqiu shook his head and wrote again. “I hope you can stay in the Zhang family for four more days.”

“Why?” Zhou Wen looked at Zhang Chunqiu in puzzlement. He wanted him to stay, but he didn’t say what he wanted him to do. This left Zhou Wen puzzled.

“Help me protect my sis for the next four days.” The sis Zhang Chunqiu mentioned was Zhang Yuzhi.

As Zhang Yuzhi was the only woman in the Zhang family’s current generation, Zhang Chunqiu and company were used to calling her sis.

“Is Yuzhi in danger?” Zhou Wen’s expression turned solemn.

Zhang Chunqiu nodded. “There’s an internal problem with the Zhang family. I’m afraid that someone will harm sis. You should understand that it’s not convenient for me to use my family’s manpower at such times.”

Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Four days shouldn’t be difficult. “Four days. No problem.”

Although the Zhang family was powerful, they ultimately didn’t have a Calamity-grade expert. It shouldn’t be too difficult to protect Zhang Yuzhi.

“Thank you.” Zhang Chunqiu said the words with his mouth.

Zhou Wen happened to hear this and shook his head. “Yuzhi is my friend. She once saved me too. It’s only right.”

Zhang Chunqiu didn’t say anything else. He smiled at Zhou Wen and got up to leave his room.

After Zhang Chunqiu left the yard, Zhang Xiao walked over and said in puzzlement, “Why did you want to keep Zhou Wen behind at such a time?”

“Sis has sacrificed too much for the Zhang family. She doesn’t even have a normal friend. Since she’s happy, let Zhou Wen stay and accompany her for a few days,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a sigh.

“Zhou Wen is just a dimwit. Since you want to make sis happy, you should tell him and get him to do his best to please her. Otherwise, with Zhou Wen’s personality, he will only make her unhappy,” Zhang Xiao said.

“Are you doubting sis’s intelligence, or do you think sis is the kind of person who will happily accept pity?” Zhang Chunqiu glanced coldly at Zhang Xiao.
