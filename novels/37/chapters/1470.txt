Chapter 1471 Sovereign Sui’s Tomb

Are we abandoning Guide? Zhou Wen looked at the distant Guide Ancient City as he guessed.

Humans were at a disadvantage and were unable to gain a foothold in the vicinity. However, as humanity grew stronger, a place with rich dimensional zones like Guide City would definitely become a place the various factions would vie for.

Compared to Luoyang, Zhou Wen actually wished to stay in Guide City. After all, this was his hometown.

It’s indeed impossible to defend Guide City now. Is there a way to first settle down inside a dimensional zone? Zhou Wen kept thinking.

However, the nearby dimensional zones didn’t have suitable locations. Even if Zhou Wen wanted to occupy a dimensional zone, he couldn’t find a suitable place.

Originally, Guide Ancient City was most suitable, but there was an extremely terrifying existence inside. Even Zhou Wen would die if he entered, much less ordinary people.

He didn’t stay any longer and headed for school since the situation had stabilized.

Zhou Wen was immediately recognized by the students and people who had come to seek refuge after he entered the school. However, they didn’t dare surround him. They only whispered from afar and secretly discussed him.

Seeing that there was no threat here, Zhou Wen unsummoned the Golden Battle God that was guarding the area. Just as he was about to seek out Yu Qiubai, he saw him walk over.

“It’s quieter over at my side. Let’s have a seat over there,” Yu Qiubai said consolingly as he looked at Zhou Wen.

Back then, the school’s management had persuaded him not to interfere with Zhou Wen’s matters to prevent him from offending Overseer An. Despite the immense pressure, he had still helped Zhou Wen get into Sunset College.

No one expected that the student back then would now stand at the top of the human pyramid and would even save the school from destruction.

Even Yu Qiubai himself sometimes wondered if this was a dream-it was simply too beautiful.

“Sir, have some tea.” Zhou Wen served the brewed tea to Yu Qiubai before interrupting his thoughts.

“It’s all thanks to your timely return. Otherwise, none of these students would have survived,” Yu Qiubai said as he held the teacup.

“This is what I, as a student, should do.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and asked, “Sir, Luoyang plans on moving all the people from Guide City to Luoyang. What are your thoughts on this?”

“Guide City has plenty of dimensional zones. However, no one can hold down these dimensional zones at present. However, with humanity’s overall strength increasing, it will definitely be a treasure land in the future. It’s best if we occupy it sooner rather than later,” Yu Qiubai said.

“Sir, I share your thoughts, but I’m just one person. I don’t have people under me, so I’m afraid we won’t be able to have a foothold,” Zhou Wen said.

“It’s impossible to occupy the entire Guide City now even if there are people and food. Furthermore, those dimensional zones are changing. It’s hard to tell what will happen in the future. If we want to seek quick success, I’m afraid it will end in failure.” Yu Qiubai added after some thought, “If you really wish to stay in Guide City, I have a suggestion. You can first occupy a dimensional zone and gain a foothold before slowly developing it.”

“That’s what I had in mind too, but I wonder which dimensional zone is more suitable. Do you have any suggestions?” Zhou Wen really wanted to stay in Guide City.

Ignoring everything else, just the humanoid monster and stone saber in Guide Ancient City was worth Zhou Wen staying behind. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“I do have an idea.” Yu Qiubai got up and took out a map of Guide City from a bookshelf. Then, he spread it out on the table and pointed at a location. “If you can take down this dimensional zone, it will be a boon for both offense and defense in the future. Even if a powerful enemy attacks, you can use the dimensional zones’ powers to fend them off…”

Zhou Wen looked in the direction Yu Qiubai had pointed, and saw that the name was “Sovereign Sui’s Tomb.”

“Sovereign Sui’s Tomb?” Zhou Wen looked at Yu Qiubai in surprise.

Sovereign Sui’s Tomb was Suirenshi’s mausoleum. It was very close to the ancient city and was almost right beside Fire God Platform. Later on, after the dimensional zones transformed, Fire God Platform ended up connected to Ancient City. However, the Sovereign Sui’s Tomb wasn’t connected to Ancient City, forming an independent dimensional zone.

Although Sovereign Sui had brought fire to humanity, Fire God Platform wasn’t his territory. Fire God Platform was actually the earliest star observatory in the East District. It belonged to E Bo.

The reason Zhou Wen was surprised was that ever since the dimensional storms, Sovereign Sui’s Tomb had become extremely mysterious. It was said that one couldn’t even enter, so how could one build a base there?

“That’s right. It’s Sovereign Sui’s Tomb.” Seeing Zhou Wen’s puzzled look, Yu Qiubai laughed heartily. “Over the years in Guide City, I haven’t done much, but I’ve studied Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. Although I don’t know it like the back of my hand, I do know it well. If you have any ideas, I can take you in to take a look.”

“Sir, do you have a way of entering? That’s great.” Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Sovereign Sui’s Tomb was beside Ancient City and was considered the center of Guide City. With this as a base, it would be convenient for him to develop his surroundings in the future.

Being close to Ancient City was what Zhou Wen wanted the most.

“Alright, I’ll take you there.” Yu Qiubai stood up with a smile. “Sir, sorry for troubling you.” Zhou Wen hurriedly got up. “I don’t wish to leave after living here for so many years either. It’s naturally best if I can stay,” Yu Qiubai said with a sigh.

Zhou Wen followed Yu Qiubai to Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. Along the way, he encountered some sporadic skeleton creatures that he easily killed.

Sovereign Sui’s Tomb was perennially enveloped by clouds. It was impossible to fly in directly. Those who did never came out.

Although Zhou Wen had spatial powers, he didn’t dare use instant transmission.

Strangely, Sovereign Sui’s Tomb didn’t have a door. It was said that there was a door in the past. After it became a dimensional zone, the door vanished. All that could be seen was a long wall.

Even if one circled Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, they wouldn’t find any entrance.

“Sir, how do we enter?” Zhou Wen looked at Yu Qiubai.

Yu Qiubai said with a smile, “Follow me.”

Zhou Wen followed Yu Qiubai forward, but Yu Qiubai didn’t approach Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. Instead, he arrived in front of a very short stone temple.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that it was an Earth temple, but when he got closer, he realized that it wasn’t earth, but a tiny strange beast.

The tiny beast was carved from stone. The workmanship was very crude, and it had been weathered by the ravages of time.

It looked like a fox squatting there.
