Chapter 1665 First Place Changes

The average person felt that the scene in front of them was extremely shocking. Mohe had killed two Starlords without even moving his hand. He was unimaginably powerful.

Furthermore, Mohe had been infamous in the past. It made it even more unbelievable now.

As for some of the top humans, they roughly guessed that Mohe might have the ability to reflect damage.

“It shouldn’t be as simple as a reflection,” Li Xuan said after some thought. “The ability to reflect damage typically consumes energy during the reflection process. Therefore, the reflected power won’t exceed the user’s strength. As for Mohe, his situation is clearly different. The reflected power is even stronger than the two Starlords.”

Xia Xuanyue, who was also watching the battle, nodded and said, “Perhaps the reflection isn’t the power involved, but the damage itself.”

“That’s very likely.” Li Xuan felt that what Xia Xuanyue said made sense.

Zhou Wen was also watching the battle. He felt that Mohe’s strength was somewhat similar to Starlord Cherished Kismet’s. He thought to himself, I wonder if Mohe will continue the challenge. I wonder who’s stronger between Mohe and Starlord Cherished Kismet?

As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, Mohe had already walked into the teleportation star. The Cube’s screen changed and became the scene of Phecda Star Palace.

This is interesting. Both of them need to reflect the powers of the other. How will they fight? Zhou Wen was intrigued.

Back when Zhou Wen fought Starlord Cherished Kismet, he had used the power of Human Sovereign to kill him. Otherwise, any force that struck him would ricochet.

If Mohe and Starlord Cherished Kismet didn’t fight and waited to reflect each other’s damage, it seemed like victory would never be decided.

Mohe pushed open the door of Phecda Star Palace and walked towards Starlord Cherished Kismet. His stance was no different from before, as though he didn’t take Starlord Cherished Kismet seriously.

“Back then, Egg Sovereign… No… Deceit King only managed to reach Phecda Star Palace with his Companion Beasts… He still hasn’t killed Starlord Cherished Kismet… If Mohe succeeds… won’t he reach first place on the rankings?”

“Even if he can’t kill Starlord Cherished Kismet, he has already reached the highest point that humans can reach. How did Mohe suddenly become so strong? Even if he contracted a Guardian, it’s impossible for him to become so strong all of a sudden, right?”

“That’s right. Furthermore, Mohe’s Life Providence is odd. It should be impossible for him to kill his opponent. How did he easily kill two Starlords?”

The spectators discussed spiritedly as they guessed why Mohe had become so strong. Furthermore, they also wanted to know how Mohe could create a miracle and kill Starlord Cherished Kismet to obtain first place on the Cube’s rankings.

Mohe walked towards Starlord Cherished Kismet step by step. Everyone’s gazes followed his figure.

Starlord Cherished Kismet sat there without any intention of getting up.

If they don’t attack, it will be a hopeless situation. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, he saw Mohe attack first and punch Starlord Cherished Kismet.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. This outcome was somewhat unexpected. Although he didn’t know what kind of power Mohe’s Guardian had, if his Life Providence hadn’t changed and he took the initiative to kill, the wound would still appear on him.

Could it be that even Mohe’s Life Providence has been changed? Zhou Wen thought.

Mohe’s punch didn’t look strong, nor did it carry any mysterious glow. It was an ordinary straight punch that struck Starlord Cherished Kismet.

Starlord Cherished Kismet showed no intention of dodging. The simple and direct punch struck him.

After Mohe’s punch landed, Starlord Cherished Kismet remained unharmed. His body didn’t even shake, but Mohe had already retracted his fist.

“Mohe’s Guardian is indeed the type that reflects damage. It’s just that the damage reflection is powerful. If he’s the one attacking his opponent, his strength will be much weaker.”

Many experts who had already guessed Mohe’s powers revealed an expression that it was as expected.

However, in the next second, everyone widened their eyes. The seemingly unharmed Starlord Cherished Kismet’s body suddenly turned to dust as the wind scattered it.

Silence! Dead silence! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

No one expected such an outcome. Everyone, including Zhou Wen, looked at the Cube’s screen in surprise. The Mohe in the dust that filled the sky was like a devil enveloped in fog, making one find him extremely terrifying.

Even the experts of the various families were shocked. They originally imagined that Mohe’s Guardian could only reflect damage, but they never expected him to instantly kill a Calamity-grade Starlord with a single punch. He was unimaginably powerful.

Mohe didn’t stop as he walked straight towards the teleportation nexus. As people guessed inwardly, looking forward to seeing how many Star Palaces Mohe could clear, they realized that the scene had switched back to the Cube’s ranking. Clearly, Mohe didn’t continue challenging.

Everyone looked at the Cube’s ranking. If nothing went wrong, Mohe’s name should have appeared there.

Indeed, the first place had changed, but the first place wasn’t named Mohe.

Fallen race’s representative. Many people silently recited the name that was ranked first.

Instantly, everyone was enlightened. They were momentarily surprised, but they felt that it was only right.

“It’s no wonder a trash like Mohe would suddenly become so strong. He has become the representative of a dimensional race.”

“A piece of trash can become so strong after becoming a representative. What if I become a representative?”

“What kind of race is the Fallen race? I’ve never heard of it before. It’s definitely not one of the six Holy races. Even a nameless race can nurture such a powerful representative. If one becomes the representatives of the six Holy races, how many benefits will they obtain? How powerful will they be?”

Instantly, everyone was pondering over something

“From the looks of it, many human geniuses will become representatives of the dimension after today,” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.

It was indeed as Li Xuan had said. After today’s battle, everyone was talking about Mohe and about representatives. It was as though everyone was extremely interested in becoming a dimensional representative overnight.

Even ordinary people who weren’t qualified to become representatives were secretly looking forward to the dimension seeking them out and turning them into experts like Mohe.

After all, even a person like Mohe, who was known as trash, could become so strong. They felt that they weren’t inferior to Mohe no matter what. If Mohe could do it, why couldn’t they?

Some humans who had received invitations from the dimensional races were embarrassed to let others know that they had received an invitation, but now, many people took the initiative to announce the invitations they received. It was as though receiving a representative invitation had become a very honorable matter.
