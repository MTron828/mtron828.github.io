Chapter 1513 My Saber Is Very Fast

After receiving Zhou Wen’s approval, Feng Qiuyan turned around and walked towards Painting Immortal.

Painting Immortal was at the Hell level. He could only barely produce strength at the Human Realm due to his possession of an ancient corpse; otherwise, it would be destroyed by Earth’s rules as punishment. He was still at the Calamity grade after all. If Zhou Wen were to fight personally, he would be more concerned with the might of the Golden Wyrm Scissors.

However, Zhou Wen had actually allowed his student to fight him. From Painting Immortal’s point of view, this was an insult.

If not for the fact that he still needed Zhou Wen, he would have already punished him, letting him know how terrifying Calamity-grade Immortals were.

Zhou Wen ignored what was on Painting Immortal’s mind. Zhou Wen knew that his strength wasn’t stronger than his from the circle drawn by him.

Instead, Feng Qiuyan’s initiative to fight and confidence surprised Zhou Wen.

I gave Feng Qiuyan the coin with the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. He should have figured out something, right? If he can figure out the trick to it, he might be able to crack the looping space. Zhou Wen looked at Feng Qiuyan, hoping to see what he had figured out from the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t have much hope. It hadn’t been long since he had given Feng Qiuyan the coin. Even if Feng Qiuyan figured out something, it couldn’t be much.

Feng Qiuyan stopped outside the circle and held his saber in his hand. He looked at Painting Immortal and said, “My saber is very fast. You have to be careful.”

Painting Immortal laughed and said in contempt, “Feel free to slash. Even a thousand slashes won’t be able to touch my clothes, much less one.”

Feng Qiuyan had already warned him. If Painting Immortal continued being careless, it was not on him. He immediately stopped talking and held his saber as he stared at the Painting Immortal in the circle.

“Impressive aura. I hope your saber can live up to that aura.” Painting Immortal thought nothing of Feng Qiuyan.

Looping space was a high-level skill. Even among Calamity-grade creatures, there weren’t many who grasped such a skill. Even for spatial-type creatures, it was difficult to say if they could master such a skill. How could it be easily cracked by a human?

Feng Qiuyan didn’t say a word. He drew the saber as the look in his eyes changed.

Fast-it was unbelievably fast.

Ignoring the fact that ordinary humans couldn’t see it clearly, even Immortal Painting saw a blur. The blade seemed to vanish from his vision.

However, Painting Immortal didn’t take it to heart. No matter how fast the saber was, it would be trapped in the looping space. It was impossible for it to injure him.

What a fast saber! It’s not easy for a Terror-grade human to master such a fast saber. I never expected Zhou Wen to have such a person by his side. Berserker Immortal was somewhat surprised.

However, he was more delighted. Having both Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan under his control would be a great boon to the establishment of the Immortals’ new faction. Berserker Immortal also didn’t believe that Feng Qiuyan’s saber could break through the looping space.

“You can… be a little faster…” Painting Immortal was still teasing Feng Qiuyan, but before he could finish his sentence, his expression changed.

The golden circle on the ground magnified, forming a strange distorted space. It was as though a painting was circling around the Painter Immortal.

Feng Qiuyan’s saber slashed at the distorted picture as the saber beam sliced right through and went for Painting Immortal without stopping

Painting Immortal quickly retreated upon sensing the anomaly, but he was still half a beat too slow. The clothes on his chest had been sliced open by the saber, leaving a deep wound that reached his bones.

If he hadn’t reacted in time and retreated a distance, the saber would have already sliced his body into two.

“How is that possible!” The four immortals widened their eyes in disbelief as they looked at Feng Qiuyan.

That was a looping spatial skill. It wasn’t impossible to use some special ability to pass through. However, to be able to slice open the looping space with a saber-a Terror-grade human at that—made them almost believe that they were dreaming.

Even Berserker Immortal looked at Feng Qiuyan in a daze, momentarily at a loss for words.

Zhou Wen was also somewhat surprised. From Feng Qiuyan’s performance, he knew that Feng Qiuyan had almost comprehended his Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation and had even independently created a way to crack it.

Of course, this method of cracking was very ineffective against the variable Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.

However, the effect on the static looping space used by Painting Immortal was excellent.

“So that’s all you have after bragging all day.” The glance and faint smile that Li Xuan gave Painting Immortal nearly made him find a hole to hide in embarrassment.

Feng Qiuyan returned to Zhou Wen and said in embarrassment, “I’m sorry, Coach. I’ve already tried my best, but I still haven’t completely understood what you taught me. My strike is still lacking and has let down your teachings.”

From Feng Qiuyan’s point of view, the looping space that Painting Immortal had set up was much simpler than the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation that Zhou Wen had instructed him to comprehend. He had actually failed to crack it cleanly and even gave Painting Immortal time to react. This was a huge oversight.

“You haven’t had much time to practice. To be able to do so is already considered a pass. Keep up the training when you return. Don’t make the same mistake again.” What else could Zhou Wen say? All he could do was tell him to train well in the future.

In any case, Zhou Wen really didn’t have anything to teach him. Feng Qiuyan’s learning aptitude was just too good.

Lacking? Hadn’t had much time to practice? A pass? Needs more practice? Painting Immortal and company were somewhat dumbfounded. If it wasn’t for the fact that the ancient corpses didn’t have any expressions, his face would have long twitched and deformed. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Berserker Immortal frowned as he looked at Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan. He thought to himself, This Zhou Wen seems somewhat different from the intelligence I have on him. It’s really strange that one of his students has such standards.

Immortal Painting and company even suspected that Feng Qiuyan wasn’t a student taught by Zhou Wen, but Wang Mingyuan’s disciple.

It was shocking enough to have such standards even as Wang Mingyuan’s disciple.

However, from Feng Qiuyan’s attitude towards Zhou Wen, the respect and worship he showed were definitely not faked.

“Everyone, the performance has ended. If there’s nothing else, go do whatever you need to do,” Li Xuan said with a smile.

Painting Immortal and company looked at each other before looking at Berserker Immortal. Their emotions were somewhat odd, especially Painting Immortal. His eyes were filled with embarrassment and indignation.

He was a mighty Hell-level powerhouse, but he was nearly split into two by a Terror-grade human. This was a great humiliation.

Berserker Immortal thought for a moment and gestured at Calligraphy Immortal.

Painting Immortal had already lost, so it wasn’t appropriate for him to take action again. Furthermore, Berserker Immortal could already tell that Feng Qiuyan was very knowledgeable about looping spaces. At Painting Immortal’s present strength, even if he tried to attack again, it probably wouldn’t be of much use considering how his abilities were restrained.

Calligraphy Immortal tacitly understood and took a step forward. He came in front of Zhou Wen and said, “I have a technique that I wish to seek your advice on.”

At that moment, Calligraphy Immortal’s attitude towards Zhou Wen was very different from before-he no longer had that condescending contempt from before.
