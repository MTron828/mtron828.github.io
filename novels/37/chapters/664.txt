Over the next few days, many strange things happened in Dragon Gate Grotto.

A huge Buddha shed tears of blood for no reason. After careful inspection, it was discovered that there was a crack in the Buddha’s eye. Red spring water surged out from it.

In the river beside Dragon Gate Grotto, there were creatures that resembled flood dragons churning. However, the back they saw was dozens of meters long. It was extremely terrifying.

Inside a Buddhist temple, a Buddhist glow bloomed. Through a pair of binoculars, one could see a skeleton dressed in monk robes sitting inside the temple hall. Every inch of its skeleton emitted a Buddhistic glow.

The entire Grotto was filled with strange sights. The military had completely sealed off the nearby area. The area near Dragon Gate Grotto on campus had been evacuated.

The matter at Dragon Gate Grotto seemed to be even more terrifying than expected. Malla and Stone Beasts had already walked out of the cave. Many of the Malla and Stone Beasts were the students’ usual hunting targets—most of them were at the Mortal and Legendary stage.

However, they now had a strange halo enveloping them. Their Strength and Speed had increased greatly. The power that erupted at the Mortal stage could reach the peak of the Mortal stage. Those at the Legendary stage could produce strength at the peak Legendary stage.

There were also Flying Beasts and Fairies circling above Dragon Gate Grotto, making the originally mysterious cave even more bizarre.

Any dimensional creature that stepped out of the defense line was killed by the soldiers, but the situation kept worsening. There were more dimensional creatures that surged out with each day.

Boom! Boom!

Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Feng Qiuyan were responsible for transporting the ammunition to the front line. This was a mission An Sheng had specially arranged for them so that they could participate in the battle at any time.

The school’s tutors were also prepared. When the battle really broke out, these Epic tutors were to be the main combat force.

Qin Wufu had already arrived at the battlefield to commandeer the troops, but An Tianzuo was nowhere to be seen.

“Young Master Wen, you have to be careful. The anomaly in Dragon Gate Grotto is too terrifying. There might be a fierce battle when the time comes.” After An Sheng arrived on the battlefield, he warned Zhou Wen and company with a heavy expression.

Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed. An Sheng knew that he had several Mythical Companion Beasts in his possession, but even so, he had solemnly warned him to be careful. It was obvious that the situation was extremely terrifying.

Li Xuan said, “Why don’t I see Overseer?”

An Sheng sighed softly and said, “Overseer has gathered all the noble families in Luoyang City for a meeting and is mobilizing them to participate in the battle.”

“It isn’t going well?” Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng’s expression and knew that things weren’t going well.

An Sheng said, “Sunset College is closest to Dragon Gate Grotto, but Sunset College has always been a home ground of the An family. They feel that helping this situation is helping the An family, so they are quite unwilling.”

“Don’t they know that once Sunset College fails, all of Luoyang will suffer?” Zhou Wen frowned.

Even someone like him who had a bad relationship with An Tianzuo was participating in this battle. This was because he knew that this wasn’t the An family’s business. It concerned the survival of Luoyang.

“Some have already planned on leaving Luoyang to seek refuge,” An Sheng said.

“Escape without fighting? Those people are even abandoning their homeland?” Feng Qiuyan frowned.

“That’s only human nature. If we manage to hold the line, they will naturally return. If we can’t, they will be able to preserve their strength and wealth. They will also be able to live free and mighty in other cities. However, ordinary citizens won’t share the same fate. Only death awaits them,” An Sheng said.

“How’s my family’s situation?” Li Xuan hadn’t received any news from his family. He didn’t know what was happening at home.

“Old Master Li didn’t say anything, but he didn’t leave Luoyang either. He seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach,” An Sheng replied.

“Adjutant An, I would like to make a remark on that.” Suddenly, they heard someone speak. They turned their heads and saw Li Mobai walking over with a dozen soldiers.

“Second Young Master Li, you’re finally here. We’ve been waiting for you for a long time.” An Sheng saw Li Mobai and the people behind him.

“All the Epic experts that the Li family can contribute are here. Including me, I’ll be at the Overseer’s disposal,” Li Mobai said.

“If the Li family is willing to help, why is Old Master Li unwilling to speak up for the Overseer during the meeting?” An Sheng asked.

Li Mobai smiled and said, “Our Li family is willing to fight to protect Luoyang. That’s our decision, but we can’t stop other families from seeking a chance to live.”

An Sheng immediately understood what he meant. All he could do was shake his head and sigh helplessly.

From this, one could tell that very few people from the major families in Luoyang were willing to participate.

“Second Young Master, please follow me. After registration, Governor Du will deploy you centrally,” An Sheng said as he prepared to lead them to the register.

“Second Brother...” Li Xuan called out with a strange expression when he saw Li Mobai looking at him.

Li Mobai said indifferently, “You don’t have to speak to me with such an attitude. I’ve never placed you in my heart. Among the Li brothers. I, Li Mobai, only acknowledge one elder brother. I only gave you the Evil King Gu as a tool for revenge. Since you can’t even be a tool, there’s no value in using you. You can do whatever you want.”

With that said, Li Mobai left with An Sheng.

Li Xuan gritted his teeth and didn’t say a word. All he did was clench his fists.

Zhou Wen patted Li Xuan on the shoulder. Li Xuan relaxed and shook his head. “Don’t worry. I know what I should do. I won’t lose myself because of his words.”

Over the next two days, some rich Luoyang families sent people to participate in the battle. However, most of them only sent one or two Epic experts. Apart from the Li family, there were only two other families who sent a formidable force.

On this day, just as Zhou Wen and company were loading the supplies, they suddenly heard an ear-piercing alarm. All the soldiers quickly rushed to their posts before they heard the rumbling sounds of cannons and gunshots.

Zhou Wen and company pushed the resources to the front lines and saw that in the direction of Dragon Gate Grotto, a large number of stone beasts and Malla were rushing out. There were also a number of flying beasts dancing in the air.

The tide of dimensional creatures charged at the defensive fortifications. The soldiers followed the commands and kept firing. The dimensional creatures fell, but more dimensional creatures took their fallen brethren and charged over.

Boom!

A cannonball exploded in front of a Vajra Malla, but it failed to kill him. He charged over with the fragments of the cannonball still embedded in him and pounced ferociously at a soldier in the trench.

The soldier didn’t retreat. He summoned a Companion Beast saber and struck the Vajra Malla, forcing it to take two steps back.

The soldiers beside him shot at the Vajra Malla. They peppered it with a rain of bullets, blasting apart his head.

A Fairy swooped down from the sky. On the battlefield that was filled with flames of war, the beautiful figure turned into a killing machine. She gracefully charged into the soldiers and blood immediately dyed the trench red.
