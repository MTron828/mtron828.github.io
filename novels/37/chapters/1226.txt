Chapter 1227: The Treasure Looter

Translator: CKtalon

Everyone was stunned when they identified the figure.

“Strange, the ones that came out previously were all golden robots. Why did something made of black crystal suddenly appear? It’s much smaller. Is it a new type?”

“This fellow doesn’t seem to have walked out of the door.”

“What’s that?”

Everyone discussed spiritedly. Even the black dragon in the room was taken aback. It didn’t attack immediately.

Just as everyone was feeling puzzled, the Golden Battle God Mark IV walked out, leaving them dumbfounded. They didn’t know what was going on. Why were there two different creatures? Previously, only one Golden Battle God appeared at a time.

Before they could react, Zhou Wen had already flashed across the room and stored away the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs on the ground, including the Golden Battle God Mark III Companion Egg.

The people watching the Cube’s live stream immediately broke out into an uproar. They understood what had happened.

“Holy sh*t, that fellow isn’t from the Venusian dimensional zone. He’s there to loot.”

“That’s not looting, it’s called picking up treasures, alright?”

“That works too? Didn’t they say that the Cube’s teleportation function is disabled when someone is challenging the Venusian dimensional zone? How did he enter?”

“Perhaps he’s an otherworldly creature to begin with. Like the gold person and the black dragon, he’s from the cosmos.”

“But he shouldn’t be able to enter the dimensional zone, right?”

“That’s not right. Why does he look human? The thing he’s wearing is Companion Beast armor, right?”

“Human? That’s impossible, right?”

“The key is how did he enter?”

As people discussed, the Golden Battle God had already attacked. However, as Zhou Wen retreated behind the black dragon, the Golden Battle God’s first target was still the black dragon.

The black dragon roared and spewed out dragon breath, hoping to block the Golden Battle God’s bullet.

However, the Golden Battle God’s bullet was somewhat special. It had a powerful spinning and drilling effect. It penetrated the black dragon’s dragon breath and shot into its body. The bullet drilled into its flesh, causing blood to immediately gush out. The black dragon roared in pain.

The Golden Battle God Mark IV bullet’s destructive power was very strong. It was the nemesis of the black dragon’s element-immunity attribute. Furthermore, the black dragon was already quite injured, so it was quickly thrown into a dangerous situation.

As though it knew that it was doomed, the black dragon had the intention to go all out. It charged forward, meeting the blanketing bullets.

Its abdomen was almost riddled with holes, but it didn’t die. It pounced on the Golden Battle God and wanted to bite off its head.

Unfortunately, it was already gravely injured, and its strength was greatly reduced. The Golden Battle God held its chin up with one hand, preventing it from biting down.

The black dragon still held on to the Golden Battle God, but it was no longer of much use. The other gun in the Golden Battle God’s hand was already aimed at its head.

Crack!

A black figure appeared behind the Golden Battle God like a ghost. A narrow saber stabbed through the Golden Battle God’s chest, piercing through the energy source inside.

The Golden Battle God’s body immediately lost its strength. The black dragon roared repeatedly and ruthlessly tore the Golden Battle God’s corpse apart.

A dimensional crystal dropped and Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to put it away. Then, he retreated to the other corner of the room and maintained a certain distance from the black dragon.

The black dragon glanced at Zhou Wen but didn’t attack. Clearly, its intelligence wasn’t low.

“That works? What’s that fellow’s background?”

“How did he get in?”

People from the various factions were guessing Zhou Wen’s origins. In the League of Guardians, Blood Shaman, Cave Era, Great Skyfiend, and Hermit were all present.

Many Guardians were also watching the battle. Sitting high on the main seat was a masked man. His face couldn’t be seen, but his eyes seemed to be so clear that one could see a reflection.

Without a doubt, this man was the master of the League of Guardians, Immortal.

“Cave Era, what are your thoughts?” Immortal looked at the scene on the Cube and asked casually.

“It’s undoubtedly a human. Furthermore, he has very powerful spatial powers,” said Cave Era.

Uesugi Nao, who had contracted Great Skyfiend, said, “In that case, as long as one has spatial powers, even if one doesn’t open the entrance to the Venusian dimensional zone, they can still enter?”

“From the looks of it, that’s right,” Cave Era answered.

“If that’s the case, we only need to find a Guardian with spatial teleportation powers to enter the Venusian dimensional zone like that person. Now, the chances of us clearing the dimensional zone are much higher,” Uesugi Nao said.

Hermit continued, “That might not be the case. There are many types of spatial powers. Perhaps not all spatial powers can enter. Furthermore, there aren’t many Guardians who have spatial abilities like interstellar teleportation. There are even fewer who have reached the Terror grade. If we only rely on flying, it will take too long to reach Venus. When that happens, the Venusian dimensional zone might have long been cleared.”

“Can you tell who this person is?” Immortal asked again.

Hermit shook his head slightly. “I can’t tell. However, I’m certain that it’s not someone from the Holy Spirit Association. The Holy Spirit Association only has one Terror-grade expert who specializes in spatial powers. We’ve all seen him before. It’s not him.”

“Could it be Thief Sage?” asked Blood Shaman. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“That’s very likely. Thief Sage is best at spatial teleportation. Furthermore, such actions are in line with his actions. However, there’s no way to confirm that it’s him or someone else,” Hermit said.

“Regardless of whether he’s Thief Sage, find him. It’s naturally best if it’s him. If it’s not him, we can also use his spatial teleportation ability to send our people in,” Immortal said.

“Yes, I’ll do it now.” Hermit bowed and left.

...

Far away in the South Pole, Liu Yun, who was standing on the snow watching the Cube, suddenly felt his nose itch for no reason. He couldn’t help but sneeze.

“Who’s missing me?” Liu Yun rubbed his nose as he muttered to himself.

...

The Golden Battle God Mark V appeared, and the black dragon could only drag its severely injured body to fight.

While the Golden Battle God was distracted, Zhou Wen teleported behind it and stabbed at its energy source again.

The six Golden Battle Gods energy sources appeared in different locations. It wasn’t easy to stab them with one strike. However, for someone like Zhou Wen who was familiar with the Golden Battle Gods, it wasn’t difficult.

With Zhou Wen’s help, the black dragon killed the Golden Battle God Mark V, but unfortunately, nothing dropped.

Zhou Wen used the same method to help the black dragon kill the Golden Battle God Mark VI, but unfortunately, nothing dropped again.

The alarms on the six doors sounded at the same time.. Something truly terrifying was coming.
