Chapter 605 Hypocritical Facade

“What wish? If it’s not too difficult, I can give it a try,” Zhou Wen said.

“It’s nothing difficult. I just want you to help me guess a riddle. Come on.” Wei Ge turned around and led the way.

“Do we still need to go to a special place for guessing riddles?” Zhou Wen asked as he followed behind.

“It took me my entire life to think of such a riddle, so show it some respect. Let’s find a place with the correct atmosphere. It will appear a little ritualistic,” Wei Ge said with a smile.

The two of them arrived at the school’s old campus. Today was convocation. Sunset College didn’t have a commencement ceremony, but there was a convocation ceremony. Students were basically attending the convocation ceremony, leaving the old campus empty.

When they arrived at an empty land, Wei Ge stopped and turned to look at Zhou Wen. “Alright, let’s do it here.”

“What’s your riddle?” Zhou Wen stared at Wei Ge and asked. He naturally understood that Wei Ge’s so-called riddle wasn’t a brain teaser.

“My riddle is actually very simple. Guess which one is real? Which one is fake?” As Wei Ge spoke, he raised his right hand and held a coin between his middle finger and index finger. With a flick, the coin flew towards Zhou Wen.

The coin’s speed was like a meteor, but it wasn’t surprising. Such speed still seemed too slow to Zhou Wen.

However, halfway through, the coin split into two, turning into two coins that flew to Zhou Wen’s sides.

The two coins looked identical. It was impossible to tell which one was real and which one was fake. Even the ripples of air being ripped apart were identical.

Zhou Wen stood still and allowed the two coins to fly past him. This was because he couldn’t tell which coin was real. There was no point in swatting them down.

After the two coins flew past him, they landed on the ground not far away. The coin on the left disappeared, leaving only the coin on the right.

“Senior, you condensed a Life Soul and advanced to the Epic stage?” Zhou Wen looked at Wei Ge in surprise. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wei Ge nodded and said, “My Life Soul is called Hypocritical Facade. You saw its ability just now, so please help me distinguish which one is the real me. Can you help me tear off that facade?”

With that said, Wei Ge’s figure suddenly moved. He was clearly a single person, but the moment he moved, he split into two and attacked Zhou Wen from both sides.

The speed and strength of the two figures felt very real. It was impossible to tell which was Wei Ge’s real body and which was an illusion.

Zhou Wen moved his feet and dodged Wei Ge’s attack like a ghost. This was because he couldn’t tell which one was the real Wei Ge.

However, this time, the two Wei Ges didn’t vanish. Instead, they split into four. The two Wei Ges transformed into four Wei Ges and attacked Zhou Wen from different directions.

Zhou Wen dodged again. In the next strike, Wei Ge’s figure split into eight and attacked Zhou Wen from all directions, sealing off all his escape routes.

If it were anyone else, they would have no choice but to make a choice. However, Zhou Wen’s movement technique was just amazing, allowing him to pass through the eight Wei Ges.

“As expected of Zhou Wen. Receive my final strike.” Wei Ge’s eyes burned. When the eight figures spoke, they emitted sound waves that made it impossible to tell where the real Wei Ge was.

In the next instant, the eight figures split apart again, transforming into sixteen figures that attacked Zhou Wen again. They sealed off every inch of space, preventing him from dodging.

This time, Zhou Wen didn’t move because he had nowhere to go. Even with his movement technique, it was impossible for him to rush out of this blockade. It was time to make a decision.

Without looking at the sixteen Wei Ges, Zhou Wen closed his eyes and stood rooted to the ground.

The first figure’s fist struck Zhou Wen, but he didn’t move. The figure vanished without a trace. It was only an illusion. It happened a second, a third, and a fourth time. One figure after another struck Zhou Wen in different poses before disappearing one after another.

The fifteen figures vanished. When the last figure charged at Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen finally opened his eyes and moved. However, he didn’t look at the figure charging at him. Instead, he turned around.

The last figure slammed into Zhou Wen’s back before disappearing.

However, another Wei Ge appeared opposite Zhou Wen.

“How did you discover me?” Wei Ge asked Zhou Wen.

“I didn’t discover you. Your illusion is real. I can’t tell if it’s real or fake,” Zhou Wen said.

“Then how did you know that the sixteen phantoms weren’t me?” Wei Ge frowned slightly. If Zhou Wen couldn’t tell the authenticity of the phantoms, how did he know that the sixteen phantoms weren’t his real body?

Zhou Wen smiled and said, “Because I believe in your character.”

“What do you mean?” Wei Ge was slightly taken aback as he asked Zhou Wen.

“Because you are a person who likes to play chess. How can a person who likes to play chess treat themselves as a chess piece?” Zhou Wen said seriously.

Wei Ge looked at Zhou Wen in a daze. After a while, he laughed and leaned back, his tears almost flowing out.

“So that’s how it is. Life is like a game of chess. What right do I, Wei Ge, have to think that I can transcend a game? I’d forgotten. If I can’t enter the game, what right do I have to influence it?” Wei Ge wiped away his smile and looked at Zhou Wen solemnly. “I’m leaving. I’m going to the capital and starting from the smallest chess piece. If there’s a day when I can change the development of the game, I hope I have the chance to ask you again to guess my riddle.”

“Are you really not staying?” Zhou Wen asked.

Wei Ge didn’t answer. He turned around and left. As he walked, he said, “It’s a pleasure to play chess with other humans, but it will be a bitter battle playing chess with the heavens. In my lifetime, if I am lucky to barely defeat the heavens, it will be enough for me.”

Zhou Wen stood there motionless as he watched Wei Ge leave.

As a chess piece, one can’t even control their fate. Can one really break out of this situation? Zhou Wen didn’t know the answer as he couldn’t help but feel vexed.

Jiang Yan, Zhong Ziya, Hui Haifeng, Wang Lu, Zhang Yuzhi, and Wei Ge were all outstanding people of the present era, but they had no choice but to head to a future they didn’t know of under the influence of fate.

Sunset College’s convocation ceremony was more like a farewell before a warrior went to the battlefield. After leaving the school gates, the students would face the battlefield of life which had no regularity. No one could protect them. Their life and death were in their hands.
