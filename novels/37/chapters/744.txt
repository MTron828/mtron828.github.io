Chapter 745: Eyes of Enticement

Translator: CKtalon

Previously, Medusa had caused a stir on the Peninsula of Gods, letting the entire Federation know of her existence.

However, all the videos that people saw were of Medusa—the snake-haired demoness. Not many had seen her maiden form.

Furthermore, ever since Medusa had been killed, no new Medusa had passed through the spatial rift to enter the Curse Demon Palace.

Therefore, the Xia family members didn’t recognize the maiden Medusa. If they knew her, they definitely wouldn’t dare to look at her or her eyes.

Unlike the snake-haired demoness, Medusa did not have the ability to petrify others. Her Eyes of Enticement needed others to see her eyes before they could be of use.

At this moment, more than ten thousand Xia family disciples saw Medusa’s eyes. Immediately, their bodies petrified as they turned pale with fright.

Xia Xuanyue’s expression changed drastically as she immediately realized the problem. She closed her eyes and slashed at Medusa.

However, because many owners of Epic swords had seen Medusa’s eyes, their bodies slowly petrified. They were unable to circulate their Essence Energy, nor could they use the Epic swords in their hands to cooperate with Xia Xuanyue. This greatly reduced the might of Xia Xuanyue’s sword beam.

Zhou Wen held the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed out a sword beam to clash with Xia Xuanyue’s sword beam.

The ancient sword in Xia Xuanyue’s hand was also transformed from a Mythical Companion Beast. It wasn’t inferior to the Golden Overlord Sword, but the stats of the Golden Overlord Sword were too domineering. When the sword beams collided, the ancient sword beam shattered due to the loss of the Myriad Sword Formation’s augmentation. The Golden Overlord Sword’s sword beam continued slashing at Xia Xuanyue.

Xia Xuanyue closed her eyes and shifted her body, dodging the Golden Sword Aura. At the same time, she brandished her sword and attacked Zhou Wen. Her movement technique was the Path to Snatching Heaven that Zhou Wen had seen before.

Back then, Zhou Wen had fought Xia Xuanyue, giving him the chance to advance the Transcendent Flying Immortal to the divine level. In that battle, Xia Xuanyue had also comprehended the profundity of the Path to Snatching Heaven, allowing it to advance to the divine level as well. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Now, Xia Xuanyue’s Path to Snatching Heaven had become more mature, giving her the boldness to snatch a path from heaven Just her movement technique alone gave others a huge sense of oppression.

As Zhou Wen was carrying the log, he was unable to use Transcendent Flying Immortal to compete with Xia Xuanyue’s Path to Snatching Heaven. The Golden Overlord Sword was a little clumsy and wasn’t suitable for fighting Xia Xuanyue. Zhou Wen threw the Golden Overlord Sword out and allowed it to attack autonomously. He drew his Bamboo Blade and clashed with Xia Xuanyue’s sword.

Medusa retreated to the side under Zhou Wen’s control. Her combat strength was very weak, so he was afraid that Xia Xuanyue’s sword beam could kill her. It wasn’t suitable for her to participate in the battle.

However, Zhou Wen couldn’t summon her back. This was because the Eyes of Enticement couldn’t permanently petrify people. It required them to see her to remain petrified.

If Zhou Wen were to unsummon her, those people would shortly recover from their petrified states.

Although they were both petrification skills, Medusa’s skill was Eyes of Enticement. Its nature was different from the Eyes of Petrification.

Previously, when Zhou Wen had fought Medusa, Truth Listener’s Evil Nullification could restrain the snake-haired demoness’s Eyes of Petrification, but it couldn’t restrain the Eyes of Enticement. This was because the two had different attributes.

Xia Xuanyue thought that Zhou Wen had killed the ten thousand swordsmen. She was filled with grief as she no longer held back with the ancient sword in her hand. Together with the Path to Snatching Heaven, she slashed at Zhou Wen again and again.

...

“Although my Xia family is big, among the younger generation, only Liuchuan and Little Yue are promising talents. To be able to cultivate the Path to Snatching Heaven to such a level, I’m afraid even Liuchuan couldn’t do it at her age, right?” On the city gates, the middle-aged man sighed.

A strange look flashed across Old Master Xia’s eyes and he said calmly, “Little Yue is very talented, but it’s a pity that she’s a girl and can’t inherit the Xia family’s business.”

The middle-aged man said, “However, our Xia family can be considered extremely lucky since Little Yue can support Liuchuan in the future.”

...

Zhang Chunqiu was also paying attention to the battle in Forbidden City. When he saw Xia Xuanyue’s movement technique, he couldn’t help but praise, “Excellent movement technique. Dugu, your movement technique isn’t much better, right?”

“Her movement technique isn’t inferior to mine.” Dugu Ge nodded.

Dugu Ge couldn’t see the situation inside Forbidden City, but when Zhou Wen entered the city, he had already secretly released some Gu worms to sneak in. Using the information transmitted by the Gu worms, he was also aware of the situation inside.

...

Shen Yuchi and the others from the bureau had been using their binoculars to observe the situation inside the city. However, there was a mysterious force inside the city that prevented ordinary binoculars from seeing anything. They could only occasionally see terrifying sword beams shoot out, but nothing else.

...

Zhou Wen was rather familiar with the Path to Snatching Heaven. Although he couldn’t dodge, the Bamboo Blade in his hand blocked Xia Xuanyue’s sword again and again. As he fought, he retreated in the direction of the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

“This Zhou Wen is really impressive. He can actually withstand such an amazing movement technique and sword technique despite carrying such a heavy piece of wood,” praised Dugu Ge.

“Don’t you think that Zhou Wen seems to know Xia Xuanyue’s movement technique very well? It looks like he can predict the future,” Zhang Chunqiu said with narrowed eyes.

“Is it a special ability? I heard that there’s a girl in the Ultimate Family Clan who has the Eye of Odin and can see through everything,” Dugu Ge mused and said.

“No, I think it’s more like Zhou Wen knows Xia Xuanyue’s movement technique very well,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“Are you saying that Zhou Wen and Xia Xuanyue have something between them?” Dugu Ge said straightforwardly. He wasn’t like Zhang Chunqiu who spoke half-truths.

“I only know that Zhou Wen definitely knows Xia Xuanyue’s movement technique very well. I don’t know if there’s anything between them,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a shrug.

...

Up on the city gates, Old Master Xia and the middle-aged man also frowned. Clearly, they shared the same thoughts as Zhang Chunqiu. Xia Xuanyue’s amazing Path to Snatching Heaven was actually blocked by Zhou Wen’s saber. It was as though he had predicted the future. This was definitely not something that could be explained by just having powerful saber techniques.

“Little Yue once represented our Xia family to be the witness for Zhou Wen’s battle in Luoyang. Perhaps she crossed paths with him back then. Perhaps she fought Zhou Wen before and not because she deliberately leaked the Path to Snatching Heaven,” the middle-aged man said.

“Zhou Wen’s understanding of the Path to Snatching Heaven isn’t as simple as exchanging blows,” Old Master Xia said indifferently. “Ah Cheng, go and settle this matter.”

“What about Liuchuan...” The middle-aged man, Ah Cheng, was somewhat hesitant.

“I’ve given him too much time,” Old Master Xia said expressionlessly.

“I know what to do.” Ah Cheng bowed slightly before jumping down the city gates and walking towards the Gate of Supreme Harmony.

When Xia Liuchuan, who was fighting Tyrant Behemoth, saw Ah Cheng coming down, his expression changed slightly.
