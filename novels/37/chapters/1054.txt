Chapter 1055: Landing on the Moon

Translator: CKtalon

After Ya went on stage, the Guardians began challenging him again. Ya was the same as before. No matter who challenged him, he would accept the challenge.

However, this time, Ya didn’t immediately accept the challenges one after another. He would always rest for some time to maintain an optimal state.

Zhou Wen had also watched a few of Ya’s battles and found him very strong. He couldn’t find any weaknesses. Together with the puppet avatar and other strange skills, he was virtually invincible.

Guardian after Guardian was defeated by Ya, but there were still Guardians constantly challenging him.

Zhou Wen didn’t continue watching. It was almost time to head to Sky Pass to meet Shen Yuchi and head to the Moon.

Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan took Ya’er and followed Wang Lu back to the Wang family. Zhou Wen went to Sky Pass alone.

Although Mythical creatures could also fly into space, humans had weak physiques. It was safer to take a rocket. Shen Yuchi had been preparing for the launch of the rocket for the past few days.

In fact, he had begun making preparations after the lunar incident. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to complete the preparations for a manned rocket launch in such a short period of time.

After arriving at the Sky Pass, Shen Yuchi personally received Zhou Wen. What surprised Zhou Wen was that Wei Ge was following Shen Yuchi.

“Isn’t this President Wei? Why are you here?” Zhou Wen asked Wei Ge.

Wei Ge smiled and said, “I’m now an inspector at the bureau. I wanted to inform you, but I don’t have your contact number. I haven’t been able to contact you. You have to give me your phone number later.”

“Since you are classmates, you should build on your relationship in the future.” Shen Yuchi smiled and said, “In the future, Little Wei will be in charge of our bureau’s liaison with you. Do you have any objections?”

“I have no objections. President Wei is quite good. He’s a very capable person. Your bureau sure is filled with talent,” Zhou Wen said with a faint smile.

“If you are interested, the bureau’s door is always open to you,” Shen Yuchi said.

“Forget it. I can’t be restrained. I’m different from others,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

Shen Yuchi stopped talking about this matter and said, “The rocket will be launched at 3:10 AM. There’s still some time to prepare. Perhaps you can rest first. Little Wei, take good care of Zhou Wen.”

“Yes, Director-General.” Wei Ge saluted.

After Shen Yuchi left, he went to a room. There was a surveillance video playing in the room. The woman with the nickname of Button was sitting there watching the surveillance footage.

“Noticed anything?” Shen Yuchi sat down and asked.

“This Wei Ge is a smooth and slick person. He’s naturally good at gathering intelligence,” said Button.

“He does have some talent. If I can take him under my wing, he might be able to achieve great things in the future,” Shen Yuchi said.

“You don’t trust him?” asked Button, having noticed something.

“Although according to the investigations, he really has nothing to do with Zhou Wen and even had some conflicts in secret, it’s best to be careful,” Shen Yuchi said.

“So you got Wei Ge to follow Zhou Wen to test him?” Button pondered.

“Not entirely. It was better to have someone who knows Zhou Wen follow him than someone who knows nothing about him,” Shen Yuchi said.

“That’s true. Then what do you want me to do?” Buttons nodded before asking again.

“Stay behind on our trip to the Moon,” Shen Yuchi said.

“I’m afraid you’ll be in danger if I’m not with you,” said Button.

“I need you to do something. I can’t let you expose yourself to them.” Shen Yuchi looked at Button and reached out to straighten the slightly wrinkled clothes on her shoulder.

“Does what you want me to do have something to do with Zhou Wen?” Button asked.

“No, it has nothing to do with him, but it’s best not to let him see you.”

“Then what do you want me to do?” Button was surprised that she had guessed wrong.

“If Wei Ge returns alive, I want you to think of a way to stay by his side,” Shen Yuchi said casually.

Button’s body trembled imperceptibly, but she immediately returned to normal. “Why? Even if he has some relationship with Zhou Wen, it’s not worth wasting too much time and energy on him, right?”

“This is my decision. You can choose to carry it out or return to where you came from,” Shen Yuchi took two steps back and said as he sized up the well-pressed clothes on Button.

“Alright, I’ll do it. But at the very least, you have to tell me what I should investigate, right?” Button gritted her teeth and said.

“There’s no need to investigate or do anything. You just need to gain his trust and wait for the day I need you,” Shen Yuchi said calmly.

...

Zhou Wen didn’t know why they had to launch the rocket at night.

He was rather curious when he first entered the rocket cabin. Although it wasn’t rare for people to fly in the sky or burrow into the ground in this era, it was still very nerve-wracking and exciting to be on a rocket.

Apart from Zhou Wen, there were eight other members, including Shen Yuchi and Wei Ge.

As for the four Censors, Zhou Wen didn’t know any of them. The other six were unfamiliar faces.

Everything was ready. After the countdown ended, the rocket flew into the sky. Zhou Wen was originally nervous and expectant, but he soon realized that the feeling of riding a rocket wasn’t as magical as he had imagined.

It could even be said to be boring because he couldn’t see anything in the cabin. He couldn’t experience the feeling of leaving Earth and watching it shrink.

I looked forward to it for nothing. Zhou Wen suddenly felt that it was better to fly out of Earth on a Companion Beast after he advanced to the Mythical stage.

The rocket launch was very successful. Soon, they entered a predetermined orbit. Everything seemed to be developing in a good direction.

However, everyone knew that their fate would only be decided when they reached the Moon.

Up to now, they still hadn’t figured out what the creature that had destroyed the lunar base was, nor had they discovered any other dimensional creatures.

More than 70 hours later, Zhou Wen and company successfully landed on the Moon, but they were still a distance away from the base. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Apart from two people staying behind, Shen Yuchi, Zhou Wen, and company headed for the lunar base.

This landing was simple. They hadn’t brought any tools like lunar rovers. In fact, they wouldn’t need to use them. Mythical Companion Beasts were much more useful here than lunar rovers.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that he could see more stars on the Moon, but now, he realized that what he could see was rather limited. It was far inferior to what he could see on Earth. It didn’t match his expectations.

“President Wei, do you want to ride with me?” Zhou Wen summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and invited Wei Ge.

Wei Ge looked at Shen Yuchi and saw him nod slightly. Only then did he smile and said into the communicator, “Alright.”
