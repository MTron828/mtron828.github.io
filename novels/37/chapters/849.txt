Chapter 850: Killing the Ghoul Mask

Translator: CKtalon

“Celestial Master, I don’t think there’s a need to waste time, right? It’s naturally impossible to dig up the Fiend Tomb. It looks like you can only choose between me and Old Mister Charlie,” said Moses.

After hearing Moses say that, Zhou Wen suddenly said, “Celestial Master, if I were you, I definitely wouldn’t choose to use the power of a Guardian.”

“Zhou Wen, what are you trying to imply?” Moses and the members of the Family Clan of Gods glared at Zhou Wen.

“Why?” Zhang Siyou looked at Zhou Wen with interest.

“It’s not convenient for me to explain the exact reason in public. I’ve already told Zhang Chunqiu. It’s best if he explains it to you in private,” Zhou Wen said as he deliberately glanced at Moses.

Originally, he had thought of a better solution, but he chose the easiest method to anger Moses and the Family Clan of Gods. This was because he needed an excuse to kill Giant God Sovereign.

Now, Moses and the members of the Family Clan of Gods looked at Zhou Wen with extremely unfriendly gazes.

Zhang Chunqiu used a secret message to convey the reason Zhou Wen had mentioned to Zhang Siyou. After hearing it, Zhang Siyou looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Are you sure about the matter regarding Giant God Sovereign?”

“I can’t be sure, but if it were me, I wouldn’t take such a risk,” Zhou Wen said.

“Celestial Master, please don’t listen to his nonsense. I know my Guardian best. There definitely won’t be a problem,” Moses explained. Although he didn’t know what Zhou Wen had said to the Zhang family, he knew that there was nothing good about it.

“Please calm down. We need some time to discuss. Please wait for a moment.” After Zhang Siyou finished speaking, he got someone to lead the three parties away, leaving only the members of the Zhang family behind to begin a discussion.

...

“Zhou Wen, do you dare accept my challenge?” Moses asked Zhou Wen coldly.

“You are just relying on a Guardian. It’s nothing impressive. Why wouldn’t I dare?” Zhou Wen replied arrogantly.

“Very well. After this matter is over, I will definitely fight you. You won’t escape then,” Moses said with a sullen expression.

“I’m afraid you will be the one to escape when the time comes.” Zhou Wen remained as arrogant as ever.

Moses didn’t say anything else. After all, this was an important area in the Zhang family. It was impossible for him to fight Zhou Wen here. It was useless to say anything now. All he could do was wait until he left.

...

The Zhang family was in an intense discussion. Naturally, Zhang Chunqiu strongly recommended Zhou Wen, but due to the teachings of the ancestral Celestial Master, many elders of the Zhang family didn’t agree to digging up the tomb.

Zhang Chunqiu’s uncle was especially against it.

“If we really want to dig up the tomb, our Zhang family has countless experts. Why would we need to rely on outsiders?” This was what most of the Zhang family members thought. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The reason they were willing to hire someone’s help with the Earth Elemental Beast as compensation was because they hoped to resolve the problem without touching the Fiend Tomb.

“Uncles, Zhou Wen can see through the Fiend Tomb. Only he knows where the Fiend Tomb can be dug and where it can’t be dug. Uncles, you should know the dangers of the Fiend Tomb better than me. We can’t take such risks,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“There are also risk-free solutions. Charlie and Moses do not need to dig open Fiend Tomb, so there’s no risk at all. Even if it’s really as Zhou Wen said and there’s a Guardian down there, making it inconvenient to use a Guardian to blast open Fiend Tomb, we can still choose Charlie. Furthermore, saying that Ba is a Guardian isn’t believable at all. When he first came, he couldn’t see any problems. Now that he’s here, he has figured everything out. It’s a little unbelievable,” Uncle Zhang said.

“Uncle...” Zhang Chunqiu wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by Uncle Zhang.

“There’s no need to say anything else. The ancestral teachings are unbreakable. Ancestral Celestial Master has already made it clear that if the Fiend Tomb is touched, our Zhang family will definitely perish. No matter what, I don’t agree to digging up the tomb.”

Zhang Chunqiu was helpless. No matter what he said, he couldn’t move the elders of the Zhang family.

After waiting for a while, the Zhang family finally finished their discussion. Zhang Siyou led the Zhang family out and said to the three of them, “After our discussion, we have decided to get Mr. Charlie to help us solve the problem of the Fiend Tomb. If Mr. Charlie can’t solve the problem of the Fiend Tomb, we will trouble the other two to help us.”

“Celestial Master, that’s a wise choice.” Charlie smiled like a gentleman, but he couldn’t hide the smugness in his eyes.

Moses and company glared at Zhou Wen, clearly believing that he had hindered them. Otherwise, they would have been the ones to obtain this opportunity.

“Sorry, I’ve tried my best,” Zhang Chunqiu walked to Zhou Wen’s side and said apologetically.

“It’s fine. The Cape family might not be able to succeed. There might still be a chance.” Zhou Wen felt that since Charlie couldn’t even see the Ghost Hornless below, the chances of him resolving the problem with Fiend Tomb were slim.

Furthermore, if he wasn’t careful, he might even lose his life there. After all, the Ghoul Mask and the Ghost Hornless’s abilities were too strange. Even Zhou Wen would be killed if he wasn’t careful. It probably wouldn’t be easy for Old Mister Charlie to return alive.

As the two of them spoke, Uncle Zhang walked past them and glanced at Zhou Wen. Then, he said to Zhang Chunqiu, “Don’t mention digging up the tomb again. As long as my old bones are still around, I won’t let anyone harm our Zhang family.”

“Uncle...” Zhang Chunqiu wanted to say something, but Uncle Zhang had already waved his hand and gone.

“Don’t worry about it. My uncle was only afraid that something would happen to the Zhang family because of the ancestral Celestial Master’s orders. He doesn’t have any intention of targeting you,” Zhang Chunqiu said helplessly to Zhou Wen.

“That’s nothing. However, I think your uncle seems to have some misunderstanding about me. I’m afraid that if Charlie doesn’t succeed, they will be willing to give Moses a chance and not me,” Zhou Wen said.

“I definitely won’t let that happen,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a firm expression.

However, Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out when he had offended the old man to make him look down on him.

Zhang Chunqiu thought for a moment and said, “Didn’t you happen to bump into my uncle the last time you were here? I think this might have something to do with you saying that you didn’t discover anything.”

Zhou Wen was enlightened. The elder originally imagined that he was here to mess around and didn’t have any true abilities.

...

On the other side, Charlie had already begun taking action. Zhou Wen and Zhang Chunqiu went to the stone platforms. Zhou Wen also wanted to see what the Great Divination Theurgy was.

Charlie produced a pair of angel wings on his back and flew to the front of the Fiend Tomb. He stopped outside the demarcating line and summoned two Companion Beasts. One was a crucifix, and the other was a book.

As the book opened, light beams shot out from the book’s surface, gradually condensing into the shape of a Ghoul Mask. Although it was a little blurry, Zhou Wen could tell that it was undoubtedly the Ghoul Mask.

This old man is quite capable, Zhou Wen thought.

Without any hesitation, the moment the Ghoul Mask’s shadow condensed, the crucifix in his other hand emitted a terrifying holy light. He used the crucifix as a sword and stabbed into the Ghoul Mask’s shadow.

The Ghoul Mask’s shadow immediately shattered the crucifix, turning into specks of light that dissipated. At the same time, there was a cracking sound from the Fiend Tomb as though something had shattered.
