Chapter 1767 Digging the Tree

The tiny Demonic Sword rushed into the lake without forming any ripples. Moments later, the lake suddenly rippled as the monster floated belly up.

As the octopus-like monster died, the fog over the Lake of Fog dissipated, revealing a clean lake surface and the nearby island with the golden fruit tree on it.

“What a powerful Companion Beast!”

“Holy sh*t, it’s fine if the people around Zhou Wen are that strong, but even his Companion Beast is crazy strong!”

“I beg for the origins of this Companion Beast.”

“Can Companion Beasts be that strong?”

Demonic Neonate’s first appearance stunned the entire Federation. It had been a long time since they had seen such a powerful Companion Beast appear. It comforted the people who were already starting to doubt the powers of Companion Beasts.

However, people were still puzzled. Without the golden apple, what could Zhou Wen do even if he arrived in front of the golden fruit tree? Was he going to dig out the golden fruit tree and bring it back?

Zhou Wen led Demonic Neonate towards the golden fruit tree. There was no other danger along the way as he successfully got ashore and arrived in front of the golden fruit tree.

Everyone stared at Zhou Wen to see what plans he had. Without the golden apple, what could he do?

In the next second, everyone widened their eyes as they saw Zhou Wen take out his phone and snap a picture of the golden fruit tree. He didn’t look like he was clearing the level, but like a tourist who was taking a picture at a landmark as a memento.

The dimension’s dimensional zone that gave people a sense of danger suddenly didn’t seem that dangerous.

Is he there to clear the level or be on vacation? No one could help but have this question rise up in their minds.

Zhou Wen took a few photos of the golden fruit tree. It was just for show. All he really needed was to take a picture of the tiny palm symbol on the golden fruit tree.

After snapping the tiny palm symbol, the phone screen displayed the words ‘downloading’. It calmed Zhou Wen down significantly.

Indeed, I can download the dungeon. Could it be that the phone’s origins are related to the dimension? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

As he was thinking, he didn’t idle. He summoned another Companion Beast.

It was Imperial Lord Behemoth, who he hadn’t used in a long time. Imperial Lord Behemoth, who had just reached the threshold of the Calamity grade, was naturally not as powerful as Demonic Neonate.

However, Imperial Lord Behemoth was very suitable for physical labor.

When people saw the majestic Imperial Lord Behemoth appear, they immediately thought of something. A thought couldn’t help but appear in their minds. Don’t tell me he really wants to dig up the golden fruit tree?

Soon, they had an answer to their doubts. This was because Imperial Lord Behemoth had really begun digging the tree. Its huge and sharp claws grabbed at the roots of the golden fruit tree.

With a clang, Imperial Lord Behemoth’s powerful claws only left a white mark on the tree root. It couldn’t even be considered damage.

Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised as he ordered Imperial Lord Behemoth to dig up the soil beside the tree root. Although it wasn’t deep, there were obvious results. It dug out a little soil.

“Holy sh*t, he’s really going to uproot the golden fruit tree!”

“What a ruthless person. Others only pluck apples, but he doesn’t even spare the tree. What’s the difference between that and digging up someone’s ancestral grave?” “Too ruthless... But I like it...”

Everyone discussed spiritedly as their attention was on the digging Imperial Lord Behemoth. They wanted to know if Imperial Lord Behemoth could dig out the golden fruit tree.

No one paid attention to Zhou Wen who was gaming on his phone.

Zhou Wen held the mysterious phone and kept paying attention to the download progress. Getting Imperial Lord Behemoth to dig up the tree was only to divert the attention of others. He didn’t believe that digging up the tree could really clear the dimensional zone.

The phone kept showing the download progress. Zhou Wen didn’t know when it would finish. All he could do was act calm as he watched Imperial Lord Behemoth dig the tree.

He didn’t wish for Imperial Lord Behemoth to dig too quickly. He didn’t know what to do next if it really dug out the tree. Before using his phone to figure out the dimensional zone’s situation, Zhou Wen didn’t dare proceed further.

Thankfully, the soil beneath the golden fruit tree was terrifyingly hard. The Calamity-grade Imperial Lord Behemoth was good at strength, but it could only dig out a small amount of soil every time. According to this, it would probably take at least half a day to dig out the golden fruit tree.

Time ticked by. Everyone kept staring at the scene, but after more than two hours passing, the scene remained fixed on Imperial Lord Behemoth’s tree digging. Many people became sleepy. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“I can’t take it anymore. I’ll go take a nap. Wake me up when he’s done digging.”

“From the looks of it, it will take at least a few hours to dig out the tree. I’ll sleep for a while too.”

Many people went to bed. After watching so many human challenges and digging for so long, it would be strange if they weren’t sleepy.

Zhou Wen was also burning with anxiety. The download was still stuck at the progress screen despite downloading for so long.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen heard a clang. It sounded like a metal clang. He was immediately given a fright as he hurriedly looked at Imperial Lord Behemoth.

With a glance, he discovered something amiss.

Imperial Lord Behemoth had dug half a meter deep into the soil beneath the tree, revealing a black object that was completely different in color from the soil.

The metal clang was produced when Imperial Lord Behemoth’s claws touched the black object.

The spectators were also attracted by the loud clang. They also saw the black object and were puzzled as to what it was.

Zhou Wen carefully observed it for a while and could only tell that it looked like metal or stone. Only a small portion was exposed, and most of it was still buried in the soil.

Seeing that the thing didn’t seem to pose any threat, Zhou Wen ordered Imperial Lord Behemoth to continue digging around the black object.

It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t wish to dig out the black object, but the hardness of the object wasn’t inferior to the golden fruit tree. Imperial Lord Behemoth’s claws couldn’t leave any marks on it, so it was impossible for it to dig it up.

The black object was bigger than Zhou Wen imagined. Imperial Lord Behemoth dug further past the black object, revealing its ever-increasing size as it dug. There was no end to the digging.

After digging for several hours, it didn’t manage to dig all the way to the edge. Instead, it dug out the surroundings of the golden fruit tree. Now, people could clearly see that the golden fruit tree was rooted in the black object. It was impossible to dig it out unless the black object was shattered. “From the looks of it, it’s impossible to uproot the golden fruit tree.” The spectators also saw Zhou Wen’s predicament as they waited for his next move.
