Chapter 1330: Federation Suicide Squad

Translator: CKtalon

Wei Yang and the other officers were a little anxious. They had been ordered to help Zhou Wen ascend the rankings, but ever since they arrived, they had only seen Zhou Wen once. It was no wonder they had such thoughts.

When they knew that Zhou Wen had returned, the officers immediately came to see him.

“Mr. Zhou, when are we leaving for Venus?” Wei Yang was the calmest among the officers, but he was the commander and had an obligation to speak on behalf of all the officers. His question was mostly asked on the behalf of those officers.

“Tomorrow.” Zhou Wen naturally hoped that it would be as soon as possible. After completing this matter, he had other things to do. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

With more and more powerful creatures appearing, he had to think of a way to quickly allow Slaughterer to undergo a Terror transformation. He felt uneasy if he didn’t advance to the Terror grade.

“Tomorrow?” The officers were stunned.

Although they hoped that Zhou Wen could complete the mission as soon as possible, they didn’t have much time to research and practice if it was happening tomorrow.

“Mr. Zhou, isn’t tomorrow too rushed?” Wei Yang frowned.

“Not at all. Get ready. We’ll set off at seven tomorrow morning. It won’t affect breakfast.” Zhou Wen planned on eating breakfast after returning.

Wei Yang and company misunderstood him, thinking that Zhou Wen was referring to them getting up early to have breakfast before going.

Wei Yang and company looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Mr. Zhou, how are we going to practice tonight?”

“Practice? What practice?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he asked Wei Yang in puzzlement.

“We’re going to Venus tomorrow morning. Don’t we need to make sure we can cooperate well?” Wei Yang’s expressionless face revealed a rare trace of doubt.

“There’s no need for practice.” Zhou Wen could do it alone. Furthermore, his order in life would be the highest. The Calamity-grade bullets would only attack him and not Wei Yang and company. There was no point in practicing.

“Then how do you want us to prepare?” Wei Yang asked.

“Just make some preparations. Go back and take a shower and change into clean clothes. It’s best if they have the presidential palace’s emblem on them, so that it’s easy to tell that you are from the presidential palace. That’s all.” Zhou Wen recalled Hui Haifeng’s suggestion from before, so he said to them, “It’s best if you put a flag on your back and write something like Federation Enlisted. It’s easier to let people know who you are representing.

“We are all officers, at least colonels. How can there be any enlisted?” an officer said.

“I didn’t say that you have to be called Federation Enlisted. You can write a name like the Federation Suicide Squad… Of course, this is just my suggestion.” Zhou Wen hurriedly said something else when he realized that the officers’ gazes didn’t look right.

The name ‘Suicide Squad’ was too unlucky. No wonder the officers looked at him strangely.

Zhou Wen ignored them and returned, leaving Wei Yang and company staring at each other.

“Commander, is this Zhou Wen reliable? He didn’t make any plans or do any team building with us. How is he going to lead us? To send us to our deaths?” an officer said indignantly.

“That’s right. What does he take us for? A suicide squad? He’s clearly sending us to our deaths!” The officers didn’t believe that they could enter the rankings without anyone at the Terror grade.

Now, seeing how casual Zhou Wen was, they became even more distrustful.

“Follow what Mr. Zhou said. Go back and prepare. We’ll gather tomorrow morning,” Wei Yang said expressionlessly.

Although he had his doubts, he was still willing to believe Hui Haifeng’s orders.

The next morning, Wei Yang and the other soldiers had already gathered before seven o’clock. When Zhou Wen arrived, they had already lined up and were ready to go.

“You really wrote it!” Zhou Wen realized that everyone was indeed carrying a flag on their backs. The flag was the Federation flag, but on the flag were the words “Federation Suicide Squad” written in white paint. Clearly, they had been added later.

“Isn’t this your order, Mr. Zhou?” Wei Yang said.

They had previously felt that this name was unlucky, but when they thought of how their chances of returning alive were slim if they followed Zhou Wen to take a shot at the rankings, they decided to use the name ‘Suicide Squad.’

“Very good. Let’s set off then. It won’t be too late to come back for breakfast after we get on the rankings.” With that said, Zhou Wen took the lead and walked towards the Cube.

Only then did everyone understand that when Zhou Wen said that it wouldn’t affect breakfast, he meant that he would eat when he returned.

“Damn, now we can only be hungry ghosts,” an officer muttered softly.

Zhou Wen heard it, but he didn’t process it. This was because Truth Listener provided him with too many voices. He wasn’t interested in listening to what the officers were saying as he walked towards the Cube.

…

After Zhou Wen and company left the Overseer Manor, An Sheng immediately secretly reported to An Tianzuo, “Overseer, they have set off.”

“Do you think those people can really make it onto the rankings?” An Tianzuo stared in the direction Zhou Wen had left. He held a cup of tea but didn’t drink it.

“Of course. With Young Master Wen around, they can definitely do it. Now it depends on what method they use,” An Sheng replied firmly.

“You sure are confident in him,” An Tianzuo said coldly.

“It’s not that I’m confident, but I’m especially confident. Young Master Wen’s strength is obvious. If the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians can get on the rankings, Young Master Wen can definitely do it. Furthermore, his ranking will definitely be above them,” An Sheng said firmly.

“Let’s hope so,” An Tianzuo said calmly.

…

The Cube lit up again, immediately attracting the attention of many humans.

“Someone is going to challenge the Venusian dimensional zone again. Who will it be this time?” Everyone was nervous as they watched the live-stream in anticipation.

When they saw more than ten officers carrying the Federation flag on their backs, everyone was stunned.

“Federation Suicide Squad… They really… weren’t particular with this name…”

“Not only are they not particular, they are simply tired of living!”

“I recognize those officers. They should be from the president. Their appearance here means that the presidential palace finally wants to enter the rankings.”

“I know those officers as well. They are all elites from the president’s side, but they should only be at the Mythical stage, right? With just these people, aren’t they dreaming if they want to enter the rankings?”

“Who’s that youth in casual clothes? Why does he look familiar?” Finally, someone focused their attention on Zhou Wen, who wasn’t wearing a military uniform.

Zhou Wen was wearing the Heavenly Robe. Although it was wrapped tightly, it didn’t cover his face. Soon, someone recognized him.

“That’s Zhou Wen from Luoyang. He’s an existence second only to the two war gods, An Tianzuo and Leng Zongzheng.”

“So the president hired Zhou Wen. But even if it’s Zhou Wen, it’s impossible for him to appear on the rankings with such Mythical officers? Isn’t the president being too casual with his decision?”
