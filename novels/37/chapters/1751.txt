Chapter 1752 Bet

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s answer, the girl said with a faint smile, “Since you are the best teacher, you must be the strongest existence. Then, why haven’t I seen your name on the Cube’s rankings?”

With that said, everyone looked at her. They knew that she had come with ill intentions. Li Xuan, who was beside Zhou Wen, frowned and wanted to say something, but he was stopped by Zhou Wen.

“Young lady, you are still young and lacking in culture and knowledge. I don’t blame you for that,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen secretly implying that she was illiterate, the girl nearly blew her top. She glared at Zhou Wen and said, “What did I say wrong? Please point it out.”

“The most outstanding artist in the world, the best chess player, and the strongest warrior. I believe many people are familiar with their names, but how many people know who their teacher is? How many people know what great achievements and works their teacher has?” Zhou Wen continued unhurriedly, “There are specialties in every field. A good teacher doesn’t necessarily have to be powerful. It depends on what kind of student the teacher produces.”

“In that case, the students you taught are very powerful. I wonder which one on the Cube’s ranking is your student? Which Immortal? Or is it a Saint?” The girl’s tone was filled with mockery as she continued, “There’s no human on the rankings. I wonder which alien is your student?”

The people beside her glared at the girl. Everyone knew that she was deliberately causing trouble.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t angry. He continued smiling as he looked at the girl and said, “Since you think so, why don’t we make a bet?”

“How?” the girl asked.

“If my disciple’s name is on the Cube’s rankings, you have to sincerely acknowledge me as your master and bow in front of everyone. Do you dare take the bet?” Zhou Wen asked the girl.

“Sure, but if you lose, I don’t want you to just acknowledge me as your master. I want you to kneel before me in public and acknowledge me as your master.” When the girl said that, everyone was enraged.

Zhou Wen’s reputation in the city was extremely high. Ignoring Li Xuan and company, even the reserve members of the City Guard who had just passed the test wished they could lunge forward and slap the girl twice.

The girl didn’t seem to notice their angry glares as she looked at Zhou Wen with contempt. She knew very well the origins of the alien races on the rankings. It was impossible for Zhou Wen’s students to be on the list.

“Sure.” Zhou Wen waved his hand to stop the commotion and gave the girl an affirmative answer.

The girl was somewhat surprised as she curled her lips and said, “Then please point out who your student is. Don’t try to bluff your way out by randomly pointing out one. That’s useless to me. I have plenty of ways to verify it.”

“There’s no need to prove it.” Zhou Wen pointed at Ming Xiu and said to the girl, “Do you think he’s considered my student?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“So what if he’s your student?” The girl frowned.

“Then let’s have his name appear on the rankings,” Zhou Wen said calmly.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Ming Xiu didn’t wait for him to say anything else. He got up and walked out. In a few steps, he had already left the square and was heading for the Cube in the city.

The girl immediately understood what Zhou Wen was up to. She couldn’t help but sneer. “What a good plan. I’m just afraid that your student will die for nothing.”

Zhou Wen only smiled and didn’t say anything else. He led everyone towards the Cube as the girl and Xiao followed.

Ever since the dimensional zone in the dimension had opened up, no human had passed through the Lake of Fog to reach the golden apple tree. Having the golden apple being plucked by the alien races left many humans depressed.

“Why hasn’t anyone stepped forward to clear the level at this point in time? Where did those human gods of war who usually claim to be invincible go? Could it be that even Human Sovereign has cowered? Is the dimension really that terrifying?” A young man watched the live broadcast as he sent comments to vent his displeasure.

Su Yi, who was hosting the program, saw many similar comments. She said with a heavy voice, “Professor Gu, there aren’t many golden apples left. Do you think humanity still stands a chance of plucking a golden

apple?”

Professor Gu pondered for a moment before saying, “Previously, there were a few famous human powerhouses who attempted it, but they failed to even pass through the Lake of Fog. It’s obvious how terrifying the dimensional zone is. They far exceed the dimensional zones in Earth’s universe. With humanity’s overall strength, I’m afraid only a few of the strongest powerhouses have the possibility of clearing the level to pluck the golden apple. However, such an existence is our most precious wealth. How can we easily take the risk? Not participating is the best choice.”

“Could it be that Human Sovereign isn’t completely confident?” Su Yi asked again.

“Impulsiveness is the devil. Regardless of whether one has the confidence or not, there’s no need to take risks. By staying useful, one can do more meaningful and valuable things in the future. I personally think that the choice between Human Sovereign and all the human powerhouses is correct. This is the correct choice…” As Professor Gu spoke, he suddenly saw the Cube light up.

“Someone’s attempting the level… It’s a human…”

“Holy sh*t, who is it? I don’t think I’ve seen him before!”

“I seem to remember him. He’s called Swordsman Today or something…”

“Fool, it’s Swordsman Tomorrow. He’s quite famous in our area, but he should be much weaker than top experts like Mohe. Why is he there?”

“Swordsman Tomorrow? Isn’t that Ming Xiu from the Ming family? I heard that he has pledged allegiance to an underling of the An family. An Tianzuo didn’t do it himself, and instead sent him there? Isn’t this sending him to his death?”

Everyone discussed spiritedly. Many people recognized Ming Xiu, but most people didn’t know that he had joined Zhou Wen.

Under the attention of everyone, Ming Xiu entered the Lake of Fog and floated above the lake. His surroundings were filled with fog; there was zero visibility.

“Swordsman Tomorrow’s Tomorrow Sword Art is rather famous, but can his Tomorrow Sword Art nullify the strange fog?” Su Yi stared at the Cube’s screen and commented.

“The fog should be a kind of nomological power. It can’t be broken by physical attacks. It’s useless no matter how good your sword techniques are…” As Professor Gu spoke, he saw Ming Xiu draw a sword.

Ming Xiu looked straight ahead and drew his sword to stab forward. The sword’s body slowly stabbed forward, and his body moved with the sword. He became one with the sword and charged forward.

His strike didn’t have a shocking aura, nor was there any resplendent sword beam. Instead, it was like a beautiful swordswoman flying on a sword, performing some kind of artistic sword dance.
