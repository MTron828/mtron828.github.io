Chapter 1472 Sovereign Sui’s Tomb Transformation

Yu Qiubai took out incense sticks he had prepared and lit three of them. He then handed the remaining three sticks to Zhou Wen and said, “Offer the incense with three bows and you’ll be teleported into the tomb.”

“Offer incense with three bows?” Zhou Wen took the incense sticks as his expression turned odd.

He wasn’t afraid of this and was willing to offer incense, but based on his past experience, nothing good would come from him offering incense.

Only those who offer incense can enter. If I blow up the stone statue, will I be able to enter? Zhou Wen hurriedly stopped Yu Qiubai when he saw that he was about to offer incense.

“Sir, it’s best you let me go first.” Zhou Wen was afraid that Yu Qiubai would be trapped inside if he blew up the stone statue.

“Alright.” Although he didn’t know why Zhou Wen wanted to bow first, Yu Qiubai stepped aside.

Zhou Wen lit the incense sticks before walking towards the stone temple. He held the incense sticks with both hands and was about to bow to the stone statue.

He heard a boom just as he bent his waist slightly. The stone statue had shifted several feet to the side, revealing a stone staircase that led down.

“What’s going on?” Yu Qiubai had entered Sovereign Sui’s Tomb quite a number of times, but he had never encountered such a situation. He had no idea that there was a passageway behind the stone statue.

Zhou Wen didn’t continue bowing as he turned to ask Yu Qiubai, “Sir, is this the path to Sovereign Sui’s Tomb?”

“I’ve no idea. When I previously entered Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, I would enter the tomb like I was riding on clouds as long as I offered incense. I’ve never seen this stone staircase,” Yu Qiubai said hesitantly.

“Then I’ll go in and take a look. Sir, wait for me outside,” Zhou Wen said as he walked into the stone temple and walked down the stone steps.

The stone steps weren’t wide, allowing only one person to walk through. Furthermore, the tunnel’s height was too short, so Zhou Wen had to bend his body to walk through. Thankfully, he didn’t discover anything dangerous. When he reached the end of the stone steps, he discovered a pool.

Zhou Wen scanned it and knew that the pool was connected to the outside. After diving into the water, he quickly crawled out of a fountain.

This is Sovereign Sui’s Tomb? Zhou Wen sized up his surroundings and discovered many strange statues. The statues were split into two rows that lined the sides of the stone path. Their shapes were extremely strange, making it impossible to tell what creatures they were.

Zhou Wen looked at the end of the stone path and saw a huge stone statue. It was a statue of a man holding a torch.

Is that Sovereign Sui’s statue? Zhou Wen realized that although Sovereign Sui’s Tomb was huge, there wasn’t a single dimensional creature inside.

The stone statues didn’t seem like anything else. Even if Zhou Wen reached out to touch them, nothing happened.

Yu Qiubai walked in and looked around as he said, “How’s this place? Only by passing through the small temple can one enter. It’s very difficult for outsiders to enter, and there aren’t any dimensional creatures inside. The dimensional creatures outside can’t enter either, so it shouldn’t be too much of a problem to use it as a residential area.”

“I wonder if there will be any changes in the future,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the stone statues and Sovereign Sui’s statue.

“Suirenshi is a sovereign of humanity. Even if something happens, it shouldn’t be too dangerous, right?” Yu Qiubai said.

If it were in the past, Zhou Wen would have shared the same thoughts as Yu Qiubai, but ever since he met the humanoid monster in the ancient city, he no longer had such thoughts.

Suirenshi was indeed a sovereign of humanity, but it was hard to say if he would harm humans after his demonization.

Furthermore, although Sovereign Sui’s Tomb looked safe, there was actually a hidden danger. Zhou Wen had already scanned the entire cemetery several times, but he didn’t even find any bugs.

How strange. It’s such a huge cemetery that’s big enough to build a city, but there aren’t any dimensional creatures. Zhou Wen felt that this place wasn’t as safe as it looked.

“After I discovered a way to enter Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, I studied it many times, but failed to find any dimensional creatures. Furthermore, dimensional creatures from other dimensional zones seldom approach Sovereign Sui’s Tomb,” Yu Qiubai explained.

Zhou Wen also noticed this. They had encountered quite a number of skeleton creatures on their trip here, but they didn’t see a single one near Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. “Let’s talk outside.” Without discovering any problems, Zhou Wen left Sovereign Sui’s Tomb with Yu Qiubai. He planned on searching the vicinity to see if he could find the tiny palm symbol.

After leaving via the stone passageway, he arrived in front of the stone temple again. Zhou Wen scanned the stone temple several times, but he didn’t find the tiny palm symbol.

He circled the outer wall of Sovereign Sui’s Tomb to no avail. He couldn’t help but feel somewhat disappointed.

Could this Sovereign Sui’s Tomb really be a cemetery used to commemorate ancient sages? Although Zhou Wen felt that it couldn’t be that simple, he really couldn’t tell what was wrong.

“Zhou Wen, what do you think?” Yu Qiubai asked.

“It does look very suitable for human habitation. The space is large enough and the entrance is hidden. Dimensional creatures don’t seem to approach this place. It’s very safe,” Zhou Wen said after some thought. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“If you plan on building a human city here, I believe many people will be willing to stay,” Yu Qiubai said.

“Let me think it through again.” After Zhou Wen sent Yu Qiubai back, he returned to Sovereign Sui’s Tomb alone. He set up a lounge chair and a table under the statue. As he rested, he observed the situation inside.

Zhou Wen also released Chick. He originally brought it here hoping that it could help, but he didn’t manage to use it in the beginning. Later on, the humanoid monster was too powerful, so Zhou Wen didn’t dare release it.

Chick was standing on the table, pecking at the nuts Zhou Wen had placed on the plate.

Zhou Wen waited for more than ten hours without discovering any problems when Chick suddenly flapped its wings and flew up.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that Chick wanted to get some exercise, but to his surprise, Chick flew towards Sovereign Sui’s and landed on the torch held by it.

Chick spat out a ball of phoenix flames. When the phoenix flames touched the torch, the torch that was originally made of stone started burning “Chick, what are you doing?” Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, he suddenly realized that the entire cemetery seemed to undergo a strange change due to the burning of the torch.

Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned his Companion Beast in alarm and prepared for combat.

However, no dimensional creature appeared in the cemetery even after a while. Instead, the weeds and trees in the cemetery seemed to grow at a speed visible to the naked eye.
