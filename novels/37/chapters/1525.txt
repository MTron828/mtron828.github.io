Chapter 1526 Satan?

Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon a few more questions, but Grim Demon wasn’t willing to elaborate on Demonic Neonate. It was useless no matter how Zhou Wen threatened him.

Demonic Neonate didn’t seem to care about her origins. She sat on Zhou Wen’s shoulder as though she was listening to something that had nothing to do with her.

Zhou Wen proceeded in the direction Demonic Neonate had pointed. As for what was there, even Grim Demon didn’t know. This was the first time Grim Demon had come to the Land of the Fallen. He had only heard of it in the past, so he had no idea what was there. He couldn’t sense what was in the direction Demonic Neonate had pointed in either.

After Zhou Wen walked for some time, he found another devil in front of him. This time, it was a golden devil.

The golden devil’s reaction when it saw Demonic Neonate was the same as the three previous devils. It immediately prostrated as though it had seen its god.

Demonic Neonate ignored him and pointed in another direction. Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue walking over.

The places Demonic Neonate pointed each had a devil-red, blue, purple, gold, green, white, and black. All seven devils were really gathered.

Could these things really be used to summon Shenron? That’s not right. Even if something can be summoned, it should be summoning the devil king himself, Satan. Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he didn’t stop walking. He continued walking in the direction Demonic Neonate had pointed.

As the sea of flowers was boundless, Zhou Wen wouldn’t know where the exit was without following Demonic Neonate’s directions.

Furthermore, without Demonic Neonate suppressing those devils, there was almost no chance of Zhou Wen fighting seven alone.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that another devil would appear, but he didn’t encounter another devil after a long walk. Even Grim Demon felt a little impatient. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This place was beautiful, but no matter how beautiful it was, it felt infinitely repetitive after being inundated by the same sights. It slowly became terrifying. This sea of flowers was the same. It was beautiful at first glance, but the longer it lasted, the more eerie and terrifying it became. Zhou Wen didn’t think it was wrong to call it hell.

After walking for an unknown period of time, a different scene finally appeared in front of them—a strange building.

The building looked like a foundation, like the bottom of an incomplete pyramid. However, a pyramid wasn’t in the same system as angels and devils. It didn’t seem to belong here.

Demonic Neonate seemed to sense something as she pointed at the strange building and said, “There.”

“What’s there?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

“I don’t know.” Demonic Neonate shook her head again.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to fly up. He wanted to see what was inside the building from afar.

He flew into the air and carefully observed the building. Although the building looked like the bottom of a pyramid, it was still somewhat different.

The building looked like it was made of rocks, but upon careful inspection, the rocks were somewhat special. They didn’t seem to be real rocks, but more like some kind of concrete. Many of the rocks were mixed with gravel and shells.

There were many broken walls on it. He couldn’t tell if they had not been completed or if they had been destroyed after completion. However, he was certain that this building looked nothing like the original building. There should be at least one floor or more above it. For some reason, there was only the lowest floor left.

Zhou Wen was still observing the strange building when Demonic Neonate jumped down and walked towards the door on the side of the building.

This building’s style was very strange, and it was difficult to tell where it came from. Seeing Demonic Neonate walk towards the door, the seven devils quickly circled the door and prostrated in front of it. They kowtowed to Demonic Neonate as though begging her not to enter.

Demonic Neonate ignored them as Grim Demon charged forward and kicked the devil in front of Demonic Neonate to the side.

With Demonic Neonate around, the few devils didn’t dare resist. They only knelt by the side and kowtowed repeatedly. They whispered as though they were pleading.

“Scram, scram, what are you screaming for?” Grim Demon led the way and protected Demonic Neonate.

Zhou Wen watched from behind with an odd expression. No matter how he looked at the scene, it felt like a landowner bullying the poor with his servants.

However, when he thought of how these bullied fellows were terrifying existences at the Hell level, Zhou Wen found it odder.

Grim Demon pushed open the sealed door and air rushed into the building as dust flew everywhere. It was unknown how long it had been since someone had entered.

Zhou Wen followed Demonic Neonate into the building and immediately realized that there were no statues or murals related to religions in the huge building.

There were only some simple symbols and words inside the building. In the middle of the building was a platform with many flowers on it.

From the looks of the flowers, they must have been plucked from outside and placed on the platform. It was unknown how long they had been lying there, but the flowers were still fresh and beautiful. There were no signs of them withering.

And on the flowers lay a girl with long silver hair.

The girl looked no different from a human. She wore a white nightgown as though she was asleep. However, Zhou Wen couldn’t hear her breathing, nor did he sense any vitality from her.

However, when Zhou Wen saw the girl’s face, his mouth gaped open. He was speechless.

The long-haired woman’s looks were very similar to Sweetie’s. However, Sweetie was blonde while she had silver hair. The other parts of her were very similar. Even her height and weight were very similar. If Sweetie is really God… Then this silver-haired girl… Could she be the legendary Satan… Zhou Wen found it increasingly odd.

Demonic Neonate wasn’t in the mood to size up the girl like Zhou Wen. She walked straight to the platform.

The seven devils also crawled in and knelt in front of the stone platform. They kept kowtowing to Demonic Neonate as they let out sobbing sounds. It was obvious that they were pleading

Demonic Neonate ignored them and walked onto the stone platform. She stepped on the petals and reached out to touch the girl.

Bang!

Demonic Neonate’s body seemed to be suddenly repelled by a force. Like a cannonball, she slammed into the distant wall.

Zhou Wen instant transmitted over and pressed a hand on Demonic Neonate’s back. Immediately, he felt a massive force surge over.

Zhou Wen used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to draw the force acting on Demonic Neonate into his body before pressing one hand on the wall.

Boom!

The rocks under Zhou Wen’s palm shattered as cracks radiated outward.

Demonic Neonate seemed extremely indignant as she flashed to the front of the platform and stared intently at the girl’s body.

Zhou Wen followed her and traced Demonic Neonate’s gaze. He saw the girl’s finger. On her finger was a ring with a gem embedded in it.

The gem was crystalline and shimmered like a star. The brilliance was clear but not cold.
