Chapter 654: Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art

Translator: CKtalon

“Junior Brother, you’ve been staring at it for so long. Have you figured out anything?” Liu Yun sat beside him and asked in boredom.

“A little,” Zhou Wen said.

“How much is a little bit?” Liu Yun continued asking.

There was no way he could figure it out without having a physique that was compatible with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument. Therefore, Liu Yun didn’t believe Zhou Wen’s words.

This had nothing to do with whether he was a genius or not. It didn’t even have much to do with his perceptivity. Without the Heavenly Star Veins, it was impossible to figure it out. This was the foundation, just like how one couldn’t build a skyscraper without a foundation. Zhou Wen had no chance of figuring out the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting.

“Just a little,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

Liu Yun curled his lips and didn’t ask any more. Zhou Wen kept staring at the Endless Sea of Stars, hoping to see what else there was in the sea of stars other than the Planet Devourer.

Unfortunately, apart from the Planet Devourer, there were no other dimensional creatures.

“Besides this Planet Devourer, is there no other dimensional creature in the Endless Sea of Stars?” Zhou Wen asked.

“There are Astral Beasts on those small planets, but they are only active on the planets and are unable to leave them. Outside the small planets, there’s only one Planet Devourer. It’s the king here. It pops a planet with each bite, devouring even the dimensional creatures on it. It’s an invincible existence. I am good at deception, so I managed to escape. If it were another person—even if the six heroes were revived—they wouldn’t be able to escape its devouring,” Liu Yun said smugly.

Zhou Wen watched for a while and felt bored. He took out his phone and gamed, grinding Mythical creatures and rare dimensional creatures.

“If you are done watching, let’s go back. Although we won’t encounter danger if we do not enter the Endless Sea of Stars, who knows when something might happen in a place like a desert. The two of us have been unlucky recently. It’s best we return soon,” said Liu Yun.

“I want to go underwater to take a look at the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument during the day. Perhaps I might discover something,” Zhou Wen said half-truthfully.

Liu Yun curled his lips and said, “Junior Brother, don’t blame me for being blunt. If you can’t figure it out at night, what would you figure out in the day? There will not be any starlight chart in the day, it’ll be a bare and dilapidated monolith.”

“I came all the way here. I’m not willing to give up if I don’t take a look,” Zhou Wen said, unmoved.

“Alright, let’s wait until you are done looking at it in the morning. I’ll sleep for a while. Wake me up later.” Liu Yun lay down and fell asleep. He was asleep in less than three seconds.

His sleeping posture was very strange. Zhou Wen felt that he was like a cat that could bounce up from the ground at any moment.

After taking a closer look, he realized that Liu Yun’s sleeping posture was extraordinary. No matter which direction he was attacked from, his posture allowed him to easily react to it.

To be able to develop such a sleeping posture, Liu Yun must have experienced many things in the past. How could a normal person be so wary when sleeping?

Zhou Wen’s senses were very sharp, but he wouldn’t maintain a combat-ready sleeping posture while sleeping because he didn’t have such a realization.

Of course, with Truth Listener around, it was impossible for ordinary people to get close to him without being discovered.

Although he had obtained quite a number of Companion Eggs after gaming the entire night, Zhou Wen didn’t get any he wanted. Medusa, Qiongqi, Torch Dragon, and company hadn’t dropped Companion Eggs.

That shouldn’t be the case. Every time I kill them, I bring the baby tiger with me. After killing them so many times, logically speaking, there should be one dropping? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.

The night quickly passed. In the morning, the starlight in the lake surged into the sky like a stream and vanished into the void. The lake returned to normal.

It looked like an ordinary lake. It was unimaginable that it would turn into a starry sky at night.

Liu Yun didn’t lie to him. The Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument was still in the lake. Zhou Wen woke Liu Yun up and asked if there was anything to take note of when entering the lake.

“There’s nothing. As long as you aren’t going into the lake at night, this lake isn’t much different from ordinary lakes.” Liu Yun shook his head.

Zhou Wen tried going into the water. Indeed, it wasn’t as miraculous as last night. He stepped into the lake, and the water only reached his waist.

Zhou Wen had learned the Nine Dragons Art from the black dragon. He dived into the water and quickly arrived at the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Monument.

Just as Liu Yun had said, in the day, this was a worn stone monument that was covered in moss. There were only scratches on it, and there was no starlight pattern. If it wasn’t for the tiny palm symbol engraved on it, it wouldn’t be eye-catching at all.

At a close distance, the mysterious phone vibrated. Zhou Wen picked up his phone and snapped a picture of the stone monument. The phone immediately entered the download interface.

After putting away his phone, Zhou Wen touched the stone monument again. It felt cold like it was made of metal.

Not daring to do anything excessive, he turned around and swam back to the shore.

“How is it, Junior Brother? Did you figure out anything?” Liu Yun asked Zhou Wen with a smile.

“A little,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.

“You figured out a little yesterday, and you figured out a little today. Added together, it will be impressive. You should have gained basic mastery, right?” Liu Yun teased Zhou Wen.

“Yes, I’ve gotten basic mastery,” Zhou Wen answered.

Liu Yun, who was drinking water, nearly choked. He looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief and asked, “Are you for real? You really gained basic mastery?”

“It’s just basic mastery. What’s so difficult about it? Haven’t you long obtained basic mastery?” Zhou Wen said casually.

Liu Yun refused to believe him. He reached out and grabbed a handful of sand from the ground. With a squeeze, the sand condensed into a ball that looked like a huge grain of sand.

Liu Yun’s hand relaxed again. The huge sand scattered and turned into yellow sand.

“If you really gained basic mastery, you should be able to do this, right?” Liu Yun said to Zhou Wen.

“I’ll give it a try.” Zhou Wen also grabbed a handful of sand from the ground. He circulated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art and pinched the sand. The sand stuck together like magnets, turning into a ball. However, it wasn’t as round as Liu Yun’s. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Holy sh*t... You’ve really gained basic mastery of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art?” Liu Yun widened his eyes as he looked at Zhou Wen as though he had seen a ghost.

“Why would I lie to you?” Zhou Wen released his hand and the sand scattered.

“Alright, I’ve already achieved my goal. Let’s head back. After we leave the desert, I’ll return the autograph to you,” Zhou Wen said.

“Junior Brother, you’re really a genius in cultivation, but how did you do it? According to what I know, cultivating the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art requires a special physique. You don’t look like you have a special physique.” Liu Yun was puzzled. He had the Heavenly Star Veins himself, so he naturally knew what characteristics one needed to have. Zhou Wen didn’t have those characteristics.

“Do I need a special physique? I don’t know about that. I just casually practiced it and attained basic mastery. I didn’t find it difficult,” Zhou Wen said.

Liu Yun felt something stuck in his throat and couldn’t say another word.
