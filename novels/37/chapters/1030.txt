Chapter 1031: Time to Collect the Debt

Translator: CKtalon

Who is that woman? She actually has such terrifying ice powers. Could she be the legendary Goddess of Ice? Otherwise, how could she freeze a top ice-type Mythical Companion Beast like the Frost Dragon into an ice sculpture with a single glance... Such a woman is actually Zhou Wen’s subordinate... Father... What kind of person did you plot against... Gaiman’s heart was filled with bitterness. He wanted to save his father, but he was afraid of bringing disaster to the Ultimate Family Clan.

Even the Frost Dragon had been frozen into ice by the woman’s casual glance. If he angered Zhou Wen, Gaiman really didn’t know what the outcome would be. However, he knew very well that the outcome wasn’t something he could bear. Neither could the entire Ultimate Family Clan bear it. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The few core members of the Ultimate Family Clan present were dumbfounded. They were momentarily at a loss.

If they had reason on their side, they might have had the courage to fight to the death, but now, they couldn’t convince themselves.

Zhou Wen looked at the frozen Frod and asked Ice Maiden, “Is it possible for the ice to melt or shatter?”

“His body has already been frozen by me. If someone’s strength is stronger than mine, it’s possible to melt or shatter the ice. However, in that case, the person inside will also melt or shatter. As long as the ice isn’t destroyed, he won’t die,” Ice Maiden answered.

“Very good.” Zhou Wen was very satisfied with this answer. On Earth, it was very difficult to find a creature stronger than Ice Maiden.

Furthermore, even if the person was stronger than Ice Maiden and could shatter the ice, that wasn’t sufficient to let Frod live.

“Zhou Wen, on account of Lance and Sadie...” Gaiman knew that it was impossible to use force, so he could only persuade Zhou Wen.

“If it wasn’t for them, do you think he would be the only one in the ice?” Zhou Wen looked at Gaiman and cut him off.

Gaiman felt his heart turn cold. He couldn’t bring himself to say what he was about to say.

Zhou Wen poured the alcohol from the bottle in his hand in front of Frod’s ice sculpture and said indifferently, “Continue living the rest of your life in the ice. I hope you can live a little longer.”

With that said, Zhou Wen turned around and left. Ice Maiden followed behind him like a maid.

The top experts of the Ultimate Family Clan were here, but no one dared to stop Zhou Wen. All they could do was watch as they left.

No... Don’t leave! Let me out! I beg you, let me out... Bastard... Kill me if you have the guts... Don’t leave... I beg you... Let me out... I haven’t even taken a sip of the alcohol... Let me out... Frod roared and pleaded inwardly.

In the past, when he had been transformed into an ice statue, he could still move around in the ice cavern, but now, he couldn’t even blink. He was like a statue with a will. It was more torturous than killing him. He would rather die than live like this.

Kill me... Kill me... Frod was on the verge of madness, but no one could hear his thoughts.

Gaiman and the others had gathered all the experts in the Ultimate Family Clan who were proficient in ice-elemental powers. They wanted to dispel the ice, but no one was able to melt it.

How could they know that this was Terror-grade frost powers? Unless one reached the Terror-grade, even if they threw the ice into the flames, they wouldn’t be able to produce even a drop of water.

Zhou Wen didn’t meet Lance, Sadie, and company. He directly contacted Wang Lu, Feng Qiuyan, and Li Xuan and left Frost City with them.

Although Zhou Wen had avenged himself, the other party was, after all, a relative of Lance and Sadie. If he were to meet them under such circumstances, it would only make both parties awkward. It was better not to meet them.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t know that a strange change was happening to the unconscious Lance.

A strange force surged out of his brain, causing his body to undergo a strange change.

Bizarre God had previously said that only Lance had Frod’s bloodline. This was contradictory and complicated to begin with.

There were many people in the Ultimate Family Clan, and in fact, many of them were directly related to Frod. Lance wasn’t very special among them, and he was already three generations from Frod.

Logically speaking, in terms of purity, a first-generation descendant like Gaiman should be closest to Frod’s bloodline.

However, Bizarre God’s so-called Frod bloodline wasn’t determined by such ways. In fact, the human body that Bizarre God had fused with had belonged to Frod.

It just wasn’t the present Frod. Instead, it was a genetic replica created by Bizarre God using Frod’s genes and humanity’s gene technology.

Although he was a genetic clone, through some means of Bizarre God, the genetic clone’s body was even more perfect and outstanding than Frod’s.

However, such a genetic clone still couldn’t meet the requirements of Bizarre God. Therefore, he had done something to Frod and left something in him, waiting for the perfect human body that was truly suitable for him to be born into.

Lance was the perfect human body that Bizarre God had been waiting for. This was why he looked so similar to Bizarre God. Unfortunately, he had chosen Zhou Wen and abandoned his initial plan.

However, Bizarre God had left something behind in Lance’s body.

Zhou Wen and company headed for the East District. Now, Zhou Wen was roughly certain that he wouldn’t be able to evolve the Glimmer Life Soul simply by going to new places.

He planned on returning to buy some necessities for survival in space before teleporting to another planet. This might be the final condition for Glimmer to break through to the Perfect state.

After some thought, Zhou Wen felt that it was likely the case. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be realistic for him to advance to a Perfect Body without using Glimmer’s interstellar teleportation ability.

After the dimensional storms, space technology had stopped advancing. Although many satellites were launched later, they were basically used for information transmission.

Humans had stopped exploring the universe. It had been a long time since humans had been able to land on the moon, much less Mars.

It wasn’t an easy task to obtain space equipment, but with Zhou Wen’s present strength, it wasn’t too difficult to obtain it.

After Wang Lu’s analysis, Zhou Wen decided to make a trip to the Special Investigation Bureau. It was time to collect some payment for the debt. He could also get some spaceflight equipment as interest on the debt.

According to Wang Lu, the Special Investigation Bureau had participated in quite a number of rocket launches. This was because satellites were basically unaffected by the anomalies on Earth. They were very useful for observing various parts of the Earth. Much of the intelligence was obtained through satellite imagery.
