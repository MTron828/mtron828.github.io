Chapter 783: Phoenix Might

Translator: CKtalon

“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded in agreement. If he couldn’t kill the Guardian, there was no harm in letting others give it a try.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t immediately take action. He had a nagging feeling that the calabash was a hidden danger.

Now that the chick was suppressing it, the calabash didn’t dare act rashly. However, if he were to fight the Guardian, it would be troublesome if the calabash released the Gu inside.

“Wait a moment. I’ll think of a way to pluck this calabash,” Zhou Wen said to Li Mobai and company.

Butterfly joked, “Just drip some blood on the cocoon. The calabash won’t hinder you. There’s no need to go through so much trouble, right? Are you afraid of not obtaining the Guardian’s recognition?”

Zhou Wen didn’t answer her as he continued studying the calabash in front of him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This calabash was indeed something good. It could even control Mythical Gu. Furthermore, it could make them fight each other and evolve through devouring the others.

This was actually very similar to the phone’s Companion Beast fusion function. However, it was a more primitive and crude version. It wasn’t as modern as the phone’s fusion function.

Zhou Wen thought to himself, If I can obtain this calabash, I’ll have an explanation if I take out some strange fusion pets in the future. But how can I obtain it? Does this thing count as a dimensional creature? If I slice off the calabash, will it drop a Companion Egg?

The chick pecked and scratched at the calabash, but it wasn’t effective. Even its golden flames didn’t have much effect on the calabash.

Zhou Wen slashed out a few times with the Golden Overlord Sword. Although he could split the calabash, the space in the calabash seemed to have the characteristic of spatial extension. The sword beam would rush in and gradually dissipate, dealing very little damage. Furthermore, the calabash could rapidly recover.

Since I can’t slice apart the calabash, I’ll eliminate it at its roots. Zhou Wen glanced at the roots of the calabash vine and planned on attacking from there.

The Golden Overlord Sword slashed down with an indestructible sword beam. Before the sword beam could strike the roots of the calabash vine, the calabash suddenly spewed out more than ten Gu.

One strange Gu after another charged at Zhou Wen. Some were as tiny as sesame seeds, while others were as large as ferocious beasts. Furthermore, their abilities were different.

Everyone was given a fright. They never expected the calabash to have so many Gu inside. Gu Shanshui and Li Mobai were reflexively prepared to do battle.

A bird’s cry sounded—it was the chick. The Gu that were charging at Zhou Wen immediately turned limp from fright as they fell from the sky.

Only a few Mythical Gu continued charging at Zhou Wen. However, from their trembling bodies, it was obvious that they were extremely afraid. They had no choice but to rush over because of the calabash’s control.

Seeing that they still dared to charge over, the chick immediately flew into a rage. It flapped its wings and leaped up, rushing over to peck at the Gu.

The chick’s strength wasn’t as strong as the Mythical Gu, but for some reason, the Mythical Gu didn’t dare resist. They were pecked by the chick until bloody, and a small Mythical Gu was swallowed by the chick.

The chick wasn’t afraid of the Gu parasitizing its body. Instantly, it looked mighty, resembling an emperor that was dealing with a group of eunuchs. The eunuchs didn’t dare fight back.

It’s no wonder Worm Dugu said that phoenixes are the nemesis of Gu. After seeing the chick, Gu Shanshui also treated it with reverence. This phoenix’s ability to restrain Gu is just too strong. Zhou Wen originally imagined that there would be a fierce battle, but from the looks of it, the chick could finish off all the Gu without him needing to do anything.

Li Mobai looked at the awe-inspiring chick and seemed to be in thought. It looked like he had guessed the chick’s origins.

It’s no wonder Zhou Wen dared to take the risk to come to the South District. So he has such a divine item on him.

Li Mobai was enlightened. He knew that it wasn’t because he had moved Zhou Wen, but because Zhou Wen had the confidence to ensure his safety that he had followed him to the Valley of No Return.

The chick unleashed its might, and in a short while, it swallowed more than ten Gu. Its body clearly swelled up and its stomach became round.

Zhou Wen suddenly recalled that the antelope had taken the chick to Mount Laojun’s Golden Peak. The chick had suddenly lost weight after returning.

Back then, Zhou Wen was puzzled as to why the chick had suddenly lost weight. Now that he thought about it, the chick must have benefited from Mount Laojun’s Golden Peak and digested the accumulated energy in its body.

It’s no wonder I felt that the chick had grown significantly after that time. It’s not because of time, but because it received some benefit. Zhou Wen now understood why the phoenix had given the chick to him.

This thing had eaten several Mythical Gu and nearly ten Epic Gu, but it was only as fat as a ball and did not immediately grow up.

If he wanted to raise it to adulthood, he didn’t know how many resources he would have to expend. He guessed that the phoenix couldn’t afford to rear so many baby phoenixes, so it wanted to help the chick choose a good family to live with—a place it could eat and sleep for free. However, for some reason, it had chosen him.

After losing all the Gu, the calabash trembled. However, it was only a calabash after all. It couldn’t escape like an animal-type dimensional creature.

Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he drew his sword and slashed. With a few strikes, he severed the roots of the calabash vine.

When the roots of the calabash snapped, the calabash vine immediately withered. The grayish-blue leaves also shrank and fell. The color of the calabash also gradually became lighter. The original grayish-blue color gradually turned grayish-white.

Zhou Wen slashed at the grayish-white calabash vine, reducing it to ashes. Only the calabash remained intact.

Zhou Wen extended his hand and sucked the calabash into his hand. He pinched it and realized that the calabash was still as hard as before. It didn’t turn to powder like the vines or leaves.

Although the calabash remained, it didn’t have any vitality left in it. Zhou Wen didn’t know if it could still be used. He decided to put it away.

The chick was so stuffed that it was staggering as it walked. It looked like it would fall to the ground and roll away at any moment.

“Stay away for now. I’m going to attack,” Zhou Wen said to Li Mobai and company.

Guardians were generally very strong. Even if Zhou Wen could kill the Guardian inside, it would definitely result in a huge battle. In order not to implicate them, he made them walk far away to give them a chance of escaping if things went south.

“It’s just a drop of blood. There’s no need to go through so much trouble, right?” Butterfly said.

“Let’s go.” Li Mobai seemed to notice something as he instructed Butterfly and Mute to retreat far away with him.

Although Gu Shanshui didn’t know why Zhou Wen wanted them to retreat, he retreated with Gu Lou and Gu He.
