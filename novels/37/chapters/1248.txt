Chapter 1249: Sword of Unkilling

“Who knows? I just came out and don’t know much,” Tsukuyomi said.

“Previously, those creatures seemed to know that they were doomed, but they still rushed into the Venusian dimensional zone. Do you know why?” Zhou Wen had always been concerned about this matter.

“I don’t know. Perhaps they weren’t happy and had a death wish,” Tsukuyomi said with a smile.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi for a while without saying a word. He felt that Tsukuyomi definitely knew something, but was unwilling to tell him. He didn’t have the ability to read minds, so all he could do was give up.

“Thank you for saving me. I’m very happy, but this place isn’t suitable for you. Go back,” Tsukuyomi said as she stood up.

“What dangers are there in the Universe?” Zhou Wen pressed.

“You will naturally know when you obtain Calamity grade power.” Tsukuyomi turned around and flew away from the asteroid. Only her cold voice passed through the vacuum and entered Zhou Wen’s ears. “Don’t leave Earth unless it’s really necessary.”

Zhou Wen wanted to ask why, but Tsukuyomi had already vanished.

What’s in the Universe that can make a powerful Calamity-grade existence so afraid, to the point of being terrified? Zhou Wen looked up at the cosmos, but he couldn’t see anything from the asteroid.

After entering the Universe more times, Zhou Wen learned something. The stars that he could see on Earth were invisible on many other planets.

After teleporting back to Earth, Zhou Wen was lucky to appear near Luoyang and quickly returned.

Perhaps it was Zhou Wen’s imagination, but Luoyang seemed to have become more prosperous than before. People came and went as shops lined the streets.

Zhou Wen quickly realized that it wasn’t an illusion. Many shops were newly opened, ones he had never seen before.

After some thought, he roughly gathered what was going on. The various factions were definitely trying their best to figure out what the An family’s aurora was.

If tough tactics didn’t work, they would have to think of other ways. Now, in the massive Luoyang, there were countless people from all walks of life who were spies of other factions.

After returning to his room, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to summon the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords. He wanted to figure out why the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords could block the fatal seventh bullet.

In theory, it was impossible for the Terror-grade Son of Heaven’s Three Swords to withstand a Calamity strike without suffering any damage. Furthermore, the bullet wasn’t an ordinary Calamity strike.

Even so, the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords hadn’t been damaged.

Zhou Wen studied the various abilities and skills of the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords one by one, hoping to find the reason why it hadn’t shattered. This also meant that he could reverse engineer the seventh bullet’s ability.

In fact, Zhou Wen wasn’t the only one studying the matter. The various factions were also studying how Looter King could block the seventh bullet.

Through Tsukuyomi’s battle, many people realized that the seventh bullet was especially powerful. The eighth bullet she subsequently caught wasn’t as potent.

Yet, a bullet as strong as the seventh had been blocked by the ancient sword. They wanted to know what Companion Beast the ancient sword was, what abilities it had, and if they could find a replacement.

The various factions were studying this aspect, but no one recognized the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords in Zhou Wen’s hand.

In fact, there was no such thing as the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords in reality. Even if they went to the Ancient Sword Tomb and had heaven-defying luck, they would, at most, obtain the Light Concealment, Shadow Concealment, or the Night Immaculate Sword.

Zhou Wen obtained the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords through fusion, so it was impossible for it to drop.

Unable to figure out the origins of the ancient sword, the various factions attempted to find Looter King, even if they had to cooperate with him.

Unfortunately, no one knew who Looter King was. The members of the media were guessing, but no one guessed Zhou Wen.

The information regarding the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was very vague and had little value for reference. Zhou Wen studied it for hours and felt that it might have something to do with its Wheel of Destiny—Sword of Unkilling.

Could it be that this Sword of Unkilling doesn’t mean that it can’t kill, but that it can’t be killed? After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that this was the most likely possibility.

In fact, its Life Providence, Life Soul, and Terror Transformation were all abilities related to the Son of Heaven. He didn’t know what they were for, but they didn’t seem to have anything to do with immortality.

If it’s really as I guessed, this sword can’t be killed. It’s not that I can’t use it to kill, so why can’t I pull it out? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that something was amiss.

Unable to figure it out, and it being the time for the Venusian instance dungeon to respawn, Zhou Wen took the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords into the Venusian instance dungeon to see if he could use it to block the Calamity-grade bullet and thereby, rush to the Golden Palace.

He had already learned the route to the Golden Palace from Tsukuyomi. As long as he could block a few bullets, he could rush in.

As for killing the dimensional creature that was firing, Zhou Wen no longer held any hope.

Even Tsukuyomi couldn’t kill it, so Zhou Wen could forget about it. After all, he wasn’t even at the Terror grade.

Using the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords to kill the Metal Guard was the same as before. He couldn’t pull it out and could only use it as a pole. With Zhou Wen’s strength, he had to use it to whack the Metal Guard.

One thing was certain. This sword could kill—it wasn’t a sword that couldn’t kill as Zhou Wen had previously imagined.

However, other than being hard, the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords didn’t have any other augmented abilities.

It was difficult for Zhou Wen to even kill the Golden Battle God with it. He failed to kill the Golden Battle God despite ‘slashing’ at it several times.

Despite both being at the Terror grade, the destructive power of the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was much weaker than the Asura Saber formed by Deva Asura.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t expect to use it for killing. He only hoped to use its strength to block the Calamity-grade existence’s bullets.

Although the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was hard enough, Zhou Wen still needed to be able to hit the bullet to block the Calamity-grade existence’s bullets.

Due to the difference in speed, Zhou Wen would be killed by a single shot when he accurately teleported or phased into existence from a teleportation. It wasn’t easy to use the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords to block the bullets.

I have to focus and use all means to determine the trajectory of the bullet. I have to prepare to block the bullet in advance. Otherwise, it will definitely be too late by the time I see it. After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that there was only one way to block the Calamity-grade existence’s bullets.

When fighting the Golden Battle Gods, Zhou Wen didn’t use all his strength to quickly kill them. Instead, he used their shots to practice blocking bullets.

Zhou Wen engraved all the Terror-grade powers that could strengthen his perceptive abilities.

Great Brahma and Human Sovereign appeared at the same time. One protected the blood-colored avatar while the other fused with its body.
