Chapter 650: What Others Think of a Tyrant

Translator: CKtalon

Orochi didn’t underestimate its enemy. The eight snakeheads spewed out Essence Energy projectiles of different attributes at the same time. The seven tails also danced wildly as they lashed at Tyrant Behemoth.

“Roar!” A roar shook the world. A crown appeared on Tyrant Behemoth’s head. Although it didn’t expand, its entire body was bathed in bloody red light as though it had been enhanced by some magical power.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Tyrant Behemoth constantly threw out its fists like a storm. The Essence Energy projectiles that Orochi spewed out were blasted apart by Tyrant Behemoth’s fists akin to exploding fireworks.

When the seven snake tails touched its fist, they emitted a terrifying metallic clang as they were sent flying. The scales on its tail shattered.

Bam!

Tyrant Behemoth rushed in front of Orochi and punched its head, sending its entire body flying.

Orochi tumbled far away before stopping. As for the snakehead which had been hit, it was mostly crushed by the terrifying augmentation of the crown.

“Impressive, it’s even stronger than the Golden Giant. As expected of Behemoth!”

“Such strength is really amazing. I’m afraid no Companion Beast can match it in terms of strength.”

The boy pulled his mother’s hand and exclaimed excitedly, “Mommy... Tyrant Behemoth is amazing... It’s really powerful...”

“That’s right. It’s really very powerful.” His mother smiled and nodded, but she was still somewhat worried. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

This was because she knew very well that Orochi’s true trump card had yet to be used. And the snake tail with a terrifying sword beam was the nemesis of Strength-type Companion Beasts like Tyrant Behemoth.

Many people were equally worried. Orochi’s tail sword beam was just too powerful. Up to now, no Companion Beast had been able to withstand a strike from that tail.

Although Tyrant Behemoth displayed overwhelming strength, it was difficult to say if one could withstand the attack of the snake tail.

Uesugi Nao didn’t keep them hanging in suspense. At the instant Tyrant Behemoth charged over again, that snake tail suddenly raised. It tore through the void with a cold sword beam, slashing at Tyrant Behemoth’s body.

Everyone knew that the moment to decide victory was coming. If Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t withstand the snake tail’s slash, it would definitely lose.

Everyone wanted to know if Tyrant Behemoth, who could swallow Chimera, could swallow the terrifying sword beam.

When the boy saw the sword beam formed by the snake’s tail, he nervously grabbed the corner of his mother’s clothes. He had already seen the same scene once. The Golden Giant was defeated by the snake tail’s sword beam despite holding the advantage. All it could do was escape with its tail in between its legs and admit defeat.

However, to everyone’s surprise, Tyrant Behemoth didn’t use the Mountain Consuming Skill. Instead, it continued brandishing its fist once again to meet the shocking sword beam formed by the snake’s tail.

At that instant, Tyrant Behemoth’s body seemed to shrink again. The strange red glow on its body also turned black-red. Tyrant Behemoth’s entire body seemed to turn into a black hole. The light couldn’t escape when it landed on its body.

Clang!

Tyrant Behemoth collided with the sword beam and the sword beam immediately shattered. The fist directly collided with the snake’s tail.

The indestructible snake tail wasn’t able to cleave apart Tyrant Behemoth’s fist. It only left a sword mark.

“Heavens, ladies and gentlemen, did you see that? Orochi’s killer blow wasn’t able to cleave apart Tyrant Behemoth’s fist! The terrifying killing technique that nearly killed the Golden Giant only left a sword mark on Tyrant Behemoth’s fist. Such injuries can’t affect Tyrant Behemoth’s combat strength at all...” Some of the more emotional commentators shouted.

“Mommy, it blocked it! It blocked the huge snake’s tail!” The boy cried out excitedly.

Before his mother could reply, Tyrant Behemoth had already grabbed the snake’s tail and used all its strength to fling Orochi away.

Bam!

Orochi was slammed to the ground. Before Orochi could react, Tyrant Behemoth slammed it left and right using its tail, smashing Orochi’s body to the ground like a sandbag.

In a few moves, it shattered most of its bones, as though it had turned into a pool of soft flesh. The snake heads went limp.

“It’s too violent and too bloody. Orochi isn’t a match for Tyrant Behemoth at all. It’s constantly being ravaged.”

“Oh my God, I can’t believe my eyes. Is that still the terrifying Orochi? In front of Tyrant Behemoth, it’s nothing.”

“Yes, that’s right. Kill it and let those overseas fellows know our Federation’s true strength.”

“It’s too tragic. After this battle, I don’t think those reptiles will be able to open their mouths and spit out words again. I can’t tell how many heads it has left or if they have all been smashed by Tyrant Behemoth.”

All the media’s announcers began to cheer up. One by one, they began to tease each other. They no longer had the stern expression they had during their previous criticism. Their choice of words also began to become humorous as all sorts of coquettish comments flew around.

In comparison, there were more people in the audience. Many people who were watching online posted a large number of comments.

“Orochi is considering which head to use to call for help. Oh, I’m sorry. I forgot that it has no hands. What should it do?”

“Daddy, stop beating me. I know I’m wrong.”

“Mommy, love me again.”

“Please make way. I don’t want to just watch the bullet comments. Give me some screen estate. I want to see if Orochi is dead.”

Everything happened too quickly. Uesugi Nao never expected that the power of Orochi’s Wheel of Destiny could not even slice apart Tyrant Behemoth’s fist.

She wanted to admit defeat and retrieve Orochi, but she felt as though it was being sucked in by a terrifying force. She was unable to summon it back.

Bam!

Another heavy blow was delivered as Orochi’s body slammed into the arena. Orochi already seemed completely boneless as it collapsed to the ground.

Tyrant Behemoth roared as its body instantly expanded to the size of a small mountain. It was even taller and more majestic than Orochi. It raised Orochi’s tail and threw it into its mouth.

A strange spirit body appeared over Uesugi Nao. Her entire body emitted a demonic glow as she suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. Her face instantly turned pale, but she finally retracted Orochi.

In the arena, Tyrant Behemoth’s fangs bit into nothing. Orochi’s body vanished, but this no longer affected the Federation’s citizens’ revelry.

“Dear viewers, thank you for witnessing this great moment with me. Tyrant Behemoth lives up to its name as a tyrant. It is deserving of its title as the king of Companion Beasts, the nightmare of all enemies. What others think of a tyrant, I think of as a king. Your Majesty, Tyrant Behemoth, thank you for bringing us such an exciting battle...”
