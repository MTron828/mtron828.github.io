Chapter 1638 Xiao’s Emotions

Jiuyang was slightly stunned. He had always thought that Xiao was the kind of person who wouldn’t reveal any of his emotions no matter what situation he faced. Even when facing death, Jiuyang had never seen him show any abnormal emotions. It was as if death to Xiao was as casual as heading home for a nap. Saints underwent a cruel period of cultivation. Every Saint was very strong, but that didn’t mean that every Saint had astonishing talent. Instead, the untalented and unaccomplished Saints would have long been eliminated.

Therefore, to outsiders, as long as they were Saints who stepped out of the Holy Lands, they appeared very strong. However, they didn’t know how cruel this was.

Jiuyang clearly remembered seeing Xiao when they were young.

Back then, Xiao was a backup Saint of the Trajectory Holy Temple, and he was a backup Saint of the Sun Holy Temple. They rarely had the chance to meet, but the Six temples would carry out a joint test every once in a while. All the reserve Saints in the six temples would participate in the test together. The people who came in last in the test would be directly eliminated.

Nobody knew where the eliminated Saints went; in any case, they would never be seen again.

Jiuyang himself was slow to warm up and he accepted new things very slowly. Therefore, his ranking was very low every time. There was once when he almost fell into the elimination ranks.

It was only then that he noticed Xiao,

as

Xiao was about the same age as him. Back then, he was still a child, only a little more than ten years old. In the past, Jiuyang didn’t notice Xiao because the better a candidate’s grade was, the closer they would stand to the front during the six temples’ joint test.

Jiuyang had always been at the back, and Xiao used to stand in front. However, Xiao was standing behind Jiuyang this time. This was the first time that Jiuyang had seriously paid attention to Xiao.

It was very dangerous back then. Xiao was only one spot away from being eliminated. All the backup Saints after Xiao were eliminated and were never seen again.

Back then, a child—who was also ranked at the back and was relatively familiar with Xiaoasked, “Xiao, your combat abilities are so impressive that you can at least rank in the top three. Why did you lose?”

“Because I’m not good at using my left hand.” Xiao’s answer puzzled Jiuyang-who was standing beside him.

The child from before was also very puzzled. He asked, “Does your ability to use your left hand have anything to do with whether you can win?”

“I wanted to use my left hand to defeat all the reserve Saints, so I only used my left hand. However, I lost very badly. But from now on, I will only use my left hand until I defeat all the reserve saints in the six temples’ joint test,” Xiao replied.

When Jiuyang heard this, he thought nothing of it.

In such a cruel competition, if Xiao had only used his left hand—which he was not good at

—to fight, he would probably end up dying very tragically. At a critical moment of life and death, he would definitely be forced to use his right hand.

However, it was only during the next six temples’ joint test that Jiuyang realized that Xiao was not joking. In that tragic battle, Xiao indeed did not use his right hand. In the entire joint test, Xiao only used his left hand. His right hand was not used at all.

Xiao naturally lost miserably. He didn’t even win a single round.

This was also very normal. Which surviving Saint wasn’t talented and willing to work hard? Furthermore, they were too young, so the means they could learn were very limited. Back then, it was very difficult to widen the gap between them.

If Xiao had fought seriously, it was not impossible for him to be in the top three or even number one. However, he kept using his non-dominant left hand to fight.

Others had practiced their dominant hands for more than ten years, but he had only practiced his hand for a month. How could this be compared?

Jiuyang originally imagined that Xiao would definitely use his right hand to fight at the final moment, but he didn’t. Xiao didn’t use his right hand even when he fell into the elimination brackets.

Jiuyang watched helplessly as this happened. He was truly puzzled.

Xiao could clearly live and clearly win, so why didn’t he use his right hand? The rule of not using his right hand was a rule he had set himself. He could completely not abide by it. No one would laugh at him. In fact, few people knew about this matter.

“Why don’t you use your right hand?” Jiuyang secretly asked Xiao before Xiao was taken away. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“I said I’d only use my left hand, so I’ll only use my left hand,” Xiao answered very easily as though he wasn’t the one about to be eliminated.

If Holy God hadn’t appeared to protect Xiao back then, Xiao’s skeleton would have probably turned to ashes by now.

From then on, Jiuyang would pay attention to Xiao from time to time. However, no matter when it was, no matter how dangerous the situation was, he didn’t see Xiao flare up. It was as if he was a robot that was following a program without any emotions.

However, Xiao now had such a crazy expression. Jiuyang had never seen such emotions before. He was somewhat worried that Xiao had already lost his composure. That would really be dangerous. He probably wouldn’t even have the chance to escape.

“You can’t take my life yet.” Xiao’s eyes were as crazy as a devil’s, but his voice was terrifyingly cold.

The Companion Beast ignored Xiao as it once again charged at him like a storm. Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

The Companion Beast’s attacks were blocked by Xiao.

He didn’t dodge; instead, he blocked all of them head-on. At such a close distance and with such unpredictable and lightning-like attacks, Xiao blocked all of them.

His reaction speed seemed to have reached an unbelievable level. Even the attack near his face was blocked by Xiao.

No… It’s not just fast… It’s more like Xiao has long sealed off all possibilities… No matter how the Companion Beast attacks, it will ultimately result in one path-being blocked by Xiao… Amazing… Jiuyang’s eyes flickered as though he found it unbelievable.

He had always believed that his combat strength and concepts were the strongest among all the Saints, but the crazy Xiao had shattered his understanding and made him suspect himself.

Without a doubt, Xiao’s combat skills weren’t weaker than his. His concepts were even stronger than his. This was somewhat different from the Xiao he knew.

Xiao’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit, but his actions were calm like a machine. He didn’t make any mistakes in such a crazy battle.

How does he do it? Jiuyang was alarmed and somewhat suspicious.

This was almost different from the Xiao he usually knew, but he was clearly Xiao. It was impossible for it to be fake.

What puzzled Jiuyang even more was that if this was Xiao’s true strength, why hadn’t Xiao used such an ability when they attacked Zhou Wen?
