Chapter 1744 Problem

“I don’t know.” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly and stared thoughtfully at the Companion Eggs.

However, the members of the Wang family had already rushed to their luggage in euphoria. They only needed to circle around to obtain many precious Companion Eggs. The things that they had risked their lives for in the past could now be obtained by taking a stroll. Anyone would be excited to the point of losing control

“Family Head, there’s no mistake about it. Everything is correct. Stop hesitating. Leave that thing behind. We don’t know what will happen in the future. Let’s quickly get a few more while we can.” A few elders from the Wang family came over to persuade Wang Lu. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Stick to the plan; it will be done in the next round. There’s no rush,” Wang Lu said.

“The plan is set by humans. We can be more flexible when needed. There’s no need to be so inflexible. If we had left that thing behind earlier, there would be three of them now. Apart from you, we can also have one…” The elder didn’t finish his sentence, but Zhou Wen understood.

The Wang family probably had a special Companion Egg or treasure, but they were afraid of any accidents, so they didn’t dare leave it there.

Now that the Wang family saw the items being replicated again and again, they couldn’t help but want Wang Lu to replicate more of that item so that they could also have a copy. “As long as it can be replicated, everyone will naturally have a share. There’s only one round left. Let’s go,” Wang Lu said as she continued on her way, not giving those people a chance to speak.

The few elders were somewhat helpless, but they didn’t say anything else. They packed their things and continued on their way with Wang Lu.

“Did you discover anything?” Wang Lu asked when she saw Zhou Wen frowning in thought.

“Not really, but I thought of something. If I want to determine which one is the original Little Li, we can leave one there and see if he will be replicated to know if he’s the original,” Zhou Wen said.

“If it’s the original version, wouldn’t there be another Little Li?” Wang Lu said with a smile.

Zhou Wen laughed as well. “That’s why it’s just a thought. Actually, there’s no point in distinguishing them. Even if you know who’s the replica, you can’t be heartless enough to kill him, right?”

“That’s right. Although he’s a replica, he’s no different from Little Li. We grew up together, so how can we bear to do it? Unless he’s not Little Li…” Wang Lu said gloomily.

“If it’s not Little Li, what else could it be?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he turned to look at the two Little Lis. When he saw them, his expression suddenly changed.

As the other members of the Wang family were excited, all of them wanted to walk faster. In the beginning, they had paid special attention to the two Little Lis, but now, the two had unknowingly fallen to the back. No one wanted to watch them.

The two Little Lis were originally identical, but now, one of them had changed at some point in time.

Little Li was only in his twenties. His eyes were rather big, and he had black oriental-styled irises. However, now that one Little Li had his head lowered, his eyes had turned completely white like a blind person.

From the point of view of an ordinary person, there were only a few differences. However, in Zhou Wen’s eyes, Little Li emitted a strange aura that resembled white smoke rising from his body.

Oh no, there’s something wrong with the replica. Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat.

The Little Li who had his head lowered suddenly looked up and revealed a strange smile at Zhou Wen. In the next moment, he pounced on the other Little Li beside him.

As the duo were too close, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to do anything. The moment the two Little Li came into contact, they seemed to fuse together, turning from two to

one.

Zhou Wen had already flashed in front of Little Li, but he didn’t know what was happening. It was naturally impossible for him to directly kill him. All he did was reach out to grab Little Li’s arm and restrain him.

“Mr. Zhou, what are you doing?” Upon hearing the commotion behind, the Wang family stopped and looked over. Seeing Zhou Wen grab Little Li’s arm, they looked at him in puzzlement.

“Don’t you realize that one Little Li is missing?” Zhou Wen stared at Little Li and said.

As they were too excited, everyone had long forgotten about Little Li. Only when Zhou Wen mentioned it did they recall.

“That’s right. Why is there only one Little Li? Where did the other Little Li go? Don’t tell me he ran off?” Everyone looked around but didn’t find the other Little Li.

“Zhou Wen, what’s going on?” Wang Lu hadn’t seen the scene, so she didn’t know that the two Little Li had fused into one.

Zhou Wen recounted what he had seen while observing Little Li’s reaction.

Little Li was very honest. He allowed Zhou Wen to grab him without moving or struggling. His eyes looked a little demented.

Everyone was puzzled when they heard that. They sized up Little Li, but no matter how they looked at it, they couldn’t imagine how the two of them had fused into one.

“There’s something wrong with the replicas here. We can’t continue replicating them,” Zhou Wen said to Wang Lu.

Before Wang Lu could say anything, an elder from the Wang family said in a strange tone, “Mr. Zhou, did the two Little Lis really fuse into one?”

“I saw it with my own eyes,” Zhou Wen said.

“There are so many people here. Why are you the only one who saw it? Isn’t it too much of a coincidence that no one else saw it?” The elder snorted coldly.

“Uncle Liu, what do you mean?” Wang Lu said unhappily.

“Family Head, I’ve already said that we should keep this matter private. However, you refused to listen and insisted on letting an outsider follow. Now, he can’t stand that our Wang family will be doing well. Family Head, what do you think we should do?” the elder said angrily.

“Uncle Liu, what are you trying to say?” Wang Lu frowned.

“None of us saw the two Little Lis fuse into one. Only Mr. Zhou saw it. He even said with certainty that there’s a problem with the replica and that we can’t continue replicating. Don’t you think that there’s a problem with this? Even if the two Little Lis really fused into one, it doesn’t mean that we can’t continue replicating. Wouldn’t using one of the replicas before they fuse work? Why can’t we continue replicating? I think it’s because someone doesn’t want our Wang family to do well and is deliberately making things difficult for us. It’s hard to tell if the other Little Li had fused or met with misfortune thanks to someone.”

“Zhou Wen doesn’t lie,” Wang Lu said.

“One can never judge a book by its cover. Family Head, you are still young. There are some things that you haven’t seen through. In front of absolute benefits, what can people not do?” The elder was rather friendly to Wang Lu, but not towards Zhou Wen. “Even if the two Little Lis have fused into one, he should be able to speak, right? If we ask him ourselves, won’t the truth be out? What’s the point of restraining him?”
