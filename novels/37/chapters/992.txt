Chapter 993: Frost City

“Which Guardian is it?” Zhou Wen asked.

“If you are willing, you will naturally know when the time comes,” The Thearch said.

“Forget it. I’m just an ordinary student. I’ll let someone else be the King of Earth.” Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t agree.

Now, he was just short of a Glimmer advancing to a Perfect Body. Perhaps the Mythical stage was already close at hand. How could he contract a Guardian at such a time?

Ignoring becoming the number one person in the world back then, Zhou Wen wouldn’t even consider becoming the number one person in the universe now.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen couldn’t tell how true The Thearch’s words were.

The Thearch’s era’s invincible Guardian shouldn’t be from the Chess Mountain’s faction right? Zhou Wen knew some history.

Chess Mountain likely represented the Shang Dynasty, but the Shang Dynasty was ultimately replaced by Zhou. If that was also a battle between Guardians, the strongest Guardian should be in Zhou.

Therefore, Zhou Wen felt that The Thearch was probably bragging and trying to trick him.

...

Hui Haifeng’s research finally produced results. After injecting Qin Ling with a new element, the Dracotaur bloodline in Qin Ling’s body became stable.

Zhou Wen didn’t know how he differentiated stability and instability, but Hui Haifeng told them with certainty that Qin Ling’s Dracotaur bloodline couldn’t be used to mutate other creatures in the future.

In that case, Qin Ling would be useless to Night Thearch. Night Thearch probably wouldn’t find trouble with her again.

However, the dimensional creatures in the Seven Dragons Sea were a huge problem. If humans were injured by them, they would still be infected and mutate.

This was something that couldn’t be resolved. This was because all the creatures in the Seven Dragons Sea had been infected and mutated. There were so many dimensional creatures that they couldn’t kill them all. The numbers were unimaginably huge.

Therefore, they could only hope that humans didn’t court death. As long as they didn’t enter the Seven Dragons Sea, nothing would happen. Without the Seven Seas Dragon King’s command, those dimensional creatures wouldn’t rush out of the Seven Dragons Sea.

Of course, it didn’t eliminate the possibility that someone wanted to take that one-thousandth chance. If the mutation succeeded, they could obtain quite a bit of strength.

As for the Seven Seas Dragon King, Zhou Wen got Primordial Spore to control it and enter the calabash. He made it its residence.

Primordial Spore was still unable to completely occupy its soul. The Seven Seas Dragon King would occasionally resist, but most of the time, it was under Primordial Spore’s control.

Sea Return City’s matters were mostly settled, and Night Thearch didn’t return. Zhou Wen planned on leaving Sea Return City and heading north. After returning to Luoyang, he would head to the North District to take a look.

Firstly, it was because the Ultimate Family Clan in the North District had expressed their goodwill to Zhou Wen. Secondly, Lance had always wanted to invite him over.

Furthermore, Sadie, Gulli, and company were considered members of the Xuanwen Club and had a good relationship with Zhou Wen and company. They also wanted to invite Zhou Wen to be a guest at the Ultimate Family Clan.

Sadie and Gulli had originally come for Zhou Wen. They didn’t plan on really finishing their four years of studies at Sunset College, so it was only a matter of time before they returned. When they heard that Zhou Wen was willing to go to the Ultimate Family Clan, they planned on returning together.

Now, the roads between the districts were getting harder and harder to traverse. They were afraid that it wouldn’t be that easy if they returned any later. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Zhou Wen naturally wanted to go to the North District because he wanted to cultivate the Glimmer Life Soul. He had to go to places he had never been before, or he would have only gamed at home.

Hui Haifeng wanted to stay in Sea Return City to do research. Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan joined Zhou Wen’s trip to the North District.

Feng Qiuyan didn’t stay in Sea Return City to accompany Qin Ling. This left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled.

“Little Yanyan, Beauty Qin is alone in Sea Return City. Aren’t you afraid that she will be snatched away by others?” Li Xuan was more nosy than Zhou Wen and asked directly.

Feng Qiuyan sighed and said, “Actually, I don’t know what to do.”

“Don’t tell me you despise her for having a dragon bloodline?” Li Xuan said with widened eyes.

“It’s not what you think. It’s just that I’ve always treated her as my biological sister in the past. I’ve never thought about romance. For the moment, I don’t know what to do,” Feng Qiuyan said in frustration.

“You really are blind to the comforts you are enjoying. If I had such a beautiful fiancée, I would have long given up my virgin boy skill,” Li Xuan said.

“Cut it out.” Zhou Wen said to Feng Qiuyan, “Then you have to think carefully. Don’t regret it when the time comes.”

“I know. I’ll consider it carefully,” Feng Qiuyan said seriously.

After meeting up with Sadie and Gulli, everyone set off for the North District. There were indeed many changes on the way, but the Ultimate Family Clan had long sent people to pick up Sadie and Gulli. Zhou Wen followed them without any accidents.

The North District was even colder now. There was ice and snow everywhere. The creatures that could survive here had very strong physiques.

Sadie and Gulli described many dimensional zones in the North District to Zhou Wen, making him look forward to them.

The group arrived at Frost City, where the Ultimate Family Clan was located. The city was actually built with ice. It looked like a fairytale world.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that Lance would welcome them, but he didn’t see him. Furthermore, when Zhou Wen asked about Lance, the person who came to welcome them spoke hesitantly as though he was hiding something.

Gulli was a straightforward person. He grabbed the person and asked, “What’s wrong with Lance?”

Helpless, the person could only tell Gulli and company.

Only then did everyone realize that Lance had been injured.

The person who had injured him was a young man from the Ultimate Family Clan, but he could only be considered a collateral relative. Lance had been injured in a fair duel.

“Impossible. How can that fellow, Joseph, be my brother’s match? My brother can give him a four-limb handicap, and Joseph still wouldn’t be his match.” Gulli shouted when he heard the name of the person who injured Lance.

“Gulli, you have been away from Frost City for too long. There are some things you aren’t aware of. Joseph has contracted a Guardian and is extremely powerful now. He challenged Lance and defeated him. Among the younger generation, he’s the strongest.” As the person spoke, he said to Sadie, “Sadie, you have to be careful. He challenged Lance and severely injured him. I’m afraid he will challenge you next.”

“How dare he!” Gulli said angrily.

Sadie gestured for Gulli not to be angry. After some thought, she said, “Joseph is also a member of the Ultimate Family Clan. I don’t think he will go against me. Let’s head back now.”

After the few of them entered the city and Zhou Wen and Li Xuan settled down, they planned on touring Frost City.

Zhou Wen and company followed the local customs and bought a fur coat and fur hat. Ya’er put on a white fox fur coat and looked charmingly naive.

“There are actually people selling Tyrant Behemoth dolls here?” Li Xuan said in surprise when he saw a large Tyrant Behemoth doll while they were shopping.

“That’s a figurine, not a doll,” a seven-year-old boy corrected him seriously.
