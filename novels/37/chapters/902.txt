Chapter 903: Fighting Uesugi Nao

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Battle God Halberd that had recently dropped and stabbed at the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle’s head.

The Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle’s turtle shell was the hardest. Comparatively speaking, its extended limbs and head didn’t have such strong defense. The Golden Battle God Halberd also had Unstoppable. With this strike, it was very likely that it could pierce through its neck.

However, just as the Golden Battle God Halberd was about to pierce the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle’s neck, a blade beam suddenly slashed out and struck the Golden Battle God Halberd.

The blade beam was fast and ruthless. It actually sent the Golden Battle God Halberd in Zhou Wen’s hand to the side, preventing him from stabbing the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle.

Zhou Wen turned his head and saw a beautiful girl from where the blade beam flew over. She held a strangely-shaped narrow blade in her hand. Zhou Wen remembered that Sei Gasakai had used a similar blade. However, they also called such a blade a sword.

“Why did you attack me?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown when he saw that the girl was the girl who had spoken to him previously. She seemed to be named Hai’er.

Uesugi Nao held the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi and said, “It’s rare to chance upon a Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle. Of course, it belongs to whoever has the ability. Is that wrong?”

The Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi was also known as the Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi. It was formed by Orochi.

“That’s true.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he suddenly thrust the Golden Battle God Halberd at Uesugi Nao.

Uesugi Nao was delighted as she didn’t hesitate to welcome him with her Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi. She thought to herself, Zhou Wen, I’ll let you know how powerful I am today.

Just as the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi was about to collide with the Golden Battle God Halberd, she suddenly heard a bell ring. Uesugi Nao immediately felt her head buzz as she felt dizzy for a moment.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to deal with Uesugi Nao. The Golden Battle God Halberd stabbed into the head of the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle and killed it. Then, it lifted its massive body and threw it into the air.

The Golden Divine Light at the tip of the Golden Battle God Halberd quickly streaked across the turtle’s abdomen, slicing it open. A dimensional crystal dropped and Zhou Wen grabbed it. It was an Essence Energy Skill Crystal.

By the time Uesugi Nao recovered from her dizziness, the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle’s corpse had landed on the ground. As for the people who had been attacking the Black Gold Thread Turtle, they had also recovered from their dizziness and were dumbfounded.

A young-looking youth had actually killed the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle in the blink of an eye. It was truly shocking.

Uesugi Nao was alarmed and furious. She was alarmed because if Zhou Wen had attacked her while she was dizzy, he might not have been able to kill her, but he would have made her suffer quite a bit. She was furious because Zhou Wen didn’t seem to treat her as an opponent at all. He had only used a feint to kill the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle. He had been fooling her from the beginning.

“Leave the dimensional crystal behind.” Uesugi Nao didn’t dare underestimate Zhou Wen again. She slashed at Zhou Wen with the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi at lightning speed as the blade beam tore out like a wheel.

The Great Might Vajra Bull beneath Zhou Wen rang the bell again. Almost at the same time, the Golden Battle God Halberd in Zhou Wen’s hand stabbed at Uesugi Nao’s heart.

Hum!

Uesugi Nao was once again stunned, but the moment the Golden Battle God Halberd stabbed her chest, her body vanished. What the Golden Battle God Halberd stabbed was only her robe.

Having escaped her clothes, Uesugi Nao was wrapped in white clothes. Only her eyes were exposed, making her look like she was wearing an ancient ninja costume.

Uesugi Nao held the blade with both hands and slashed down with astonishing speed. The blade beam descended like a wheel.

Clang!

Zhou Wen brandished the Golden Battle God Halberd and blocked Uesugi Nao’s blade beam and blade. Uesugi Nao’s blade left a mark on the Golden Battle God Halberd.

What a sharp blade. It’s probably even sharper than the Golden Overlord Sword. Zhou Wen was somewhat interested in the blade in Uesugi Nao’s hand, but he didn’t know that it was transformed from Orochi.

Uesugi Nao landed on the ground as white fog emitted from her body. She suddenly vanished and when she appeared again, she was already behind Zhou Wen. She slashed down again.

The Great Might Vajra Bull’s cooldown was up. It rang the bell again.

Uesugi Nao had already predicted the bell’s ringing. At the same time the bell rang, her body suddenly exploded, turning into a mist that vanished, preventing Zhou Wen from attacking her while she was dizzy. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

By the time she appeared again, she had already appeared beside Zhou Wen. She slashed at the Great Might Vajra Bull’s leg with her Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi.

Zhou Wen brandished his halberd to block Uesugi Nao’s blade. Uesugi Nao did a roll and disappeared into the sand.

Suddenly, the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi stabbed out of the sand, straight at the Great Might Vajra Bull’s abdomen.

An escape technique? It’s a little similar, but it’s also a little different. Zhou Wen put away the Great Might Vajra Bull and leaped into the air with Ya’er in his arms. He dodged Uesugi Nao’s blade beam and retracted the Golden Battle God Halberd.

The Golden Battle God Halberd blocked twice, but it had two blade marks left on it. If it was slashed a few more times, it would probably have snapped.

Uesugi Nao swept her blade upwards. The blade beams were so fast that they seemed to have no shadows. Each strike was faster and more ruthless.

Zhou Wen’s figure was elegant. No matter how fast and ruthless Uesugi Nao’s blade techniques were, no matter how sinister they were, they couldn’t touch Zhou Wen’s clothes.

How could a Mythical Transcendent Flying Immortal be struck so easily?

Uesugi Nao pushed her skills to the limit. She constantly changed positions and used different skills, but nothing worked.

Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to observe Uesugi Nao’s every move and realized that although her skill was very similar to the Five-Element escape technique, there were still some differences.

The Five-Element escape technique was to assimilate one’s body with the five elements. It required one to possess the physique of the five elements. Furthermore, her technique didn’t assimilate her body with the five elements. It only enveloped the power of the five elements. Such an escape technique could be used for short distances, but it definitely couldn’t be used for long-distance escaping.

Furthermore, her body was still present. She hadn’t completely assimilated the five elements. Even when using the escape technique, Truth Listener could still hear her.

Once Uesugi Nao escaped into the sand again, Zhou Wen used his finger as a sword and stabbed out a sword beam. It was the first move of the Thirteen Swords of the Peach Blossom Valley’s white-robed man—Immortal Guides the Way.

Uesugi Nao was just about to rush out when she saw the sword beam land. It was too late to change positions, so she could only brandish her blade to block Zhou Wen’s sword beam.

The Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi was very sharp and it forcefully sliced open the sword aura from the middle. However, to Uesugi Nao’s horror, the sword aura that was split into two didn’t disperse. It continued to stab at her, and Uesugi Nao no longer had the strength to resist.

Boom!

A crazy power surged out from Uesugi Nao’s body like a fountain.
