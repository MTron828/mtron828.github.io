Chapter 1615 Analyzing the Video

Jiuyang palm’s might blotted out the sky. Xiao’s movement technique was bizarre. Old K’s combat techniques were the worst, but the scepter contained some kind of magical power. It could block the Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand every time.

The trio besieged Zhou Wen with attacks that left him stifled. Ignoring the ordinary spectators, even existences like Xia Liuchuan, Zhang Chunqiu, and Lance broke out into a cold sweat.

They placed themselves in Zhou Wen’s shoes and imagined how they could withstand such attacks. However, no matter how they thought about it, they realized that they would be quickly overwhelmed and killed.

Lance was too engrossed in this enactment. After watching for a while, his face was as pale as snow. In the end, he spat out blood.

With the augmentation of the Holy Artifact, the three of them had Strength and Speed that had already reached the Heaven level. Ignoring the trio, just any one of them was not someone most humans could match. Anyone would think that they were doomed to lose if the trio attacked.

However, under the siege of the trio, Zhou Wen’s body was like a flying immortal. He held the saber in his right hand and the scabbard in the left as he fought the trio to a draw.

All the major media outlets were trying their best to analyze the ultra slow-motion video. Ordinary people couldn’t see the battle from the video at all. Only some special equipment could analyze through slow motion.

“Professor Gu, the video is still being analyzed. Our level is too low, so we can’t see the battle situation. Can you tell us the current situation?” Su Yi said to Professor Gu.

Professor Gu nudged his glasses and said in a deep voice, “Even Mythical experts can’t see such a battle clearly. I can only analyze it based on some of the available information.”

“Please speak.” Su Yi was also curious about the situation.

Although many people believed that Professor Gu was a jinx whose predictions were always inaccurate, they could only see flashes of light. They had no idea what was going on. Regardless of whether what he said was right or wrong, it was good to hear what he had to say.

O VII.

Furthermore, other than some of Professor Gu’s analysis mistakes, some of his analysis made sense.

Professor Gu cleared his throat and said, “We’ve already seen Deceit King’s combat strength in the previous Cube ranking battle. Later on, many experts did an ultra slow-motion analysis. He indeed has high combat strength; his level is even higher than Immortal and Ya, but he’s still on the same level. He doesn’t have the ability to deliver absolute suppression.”

“We’ve already analyzed a portion of the battle between Immortal and Ya. Their combat strength is actually still a little inferior to the three Saints. In that case, Deceit King’s strength is about the level of a Saint. It might even be superior.”

“Of course, if Deceit King were to use Companion Beasts, the strength of the Void Salamander and the Tiger Soul General would be extremely terrifying. In a one-on-one situation, he shouldn’t be weaker than a Saint. He might even be stronger. However, now that he’s not using Companion Beasts and is only using his own abilities and combat strength, things aren’t looking good.”

“Deceit King has always been smart. Does he have a reason for doing this?” Su Yi asked again.

“I don’t know what plans he has, but everyone has seen the strength of the three Saints. It’s especially so for Xiao. His strength is terrifying. I really can’t think of anyone among humans who is stronger than him. Similarly, he’s proficient in spatial powers. In a one-on-one situation, even Deceit King might not be able to gain the upper hand, much less now when he’s fighting against three. If Deceit King summons a Companion Beast, there’s still a chance. Otherwise, I really can’t think of a chance for him to win.”

“Of course, I believe that it’s definitely a tactic if Deceit King doesn’t summon his Companion Beasts. He will likely summon his Companion Beasts at the critical moment…” Professor Gu continued analyzing. As people listened to Professor Gu’s analysis, they couldn’t help but agree. Although Professor Gu was famous as a jinx, these words reached their hearts. “Professor Gu is right. Deceit King is probably leaving his Companion Beasts as a trump card by not summoning them.” “Professor Gu’s analysis is a little reliable this time.”

“I hope Professor Gu doesn’t jinx it again. The Companion Beasts are definitely a trump card. Deceit King will definitely win.”

“I think I’ll support Professor Gu this time.”

Everyone felt that Professor Gu’s analysis was right. Looking at the various comments that finally supported him after all this time, Professor Gu was secretly delighted. I should be able to make a comeback this time. I should be able to wipe away the stigma of being a jinx.

Just as Professor Gu was thinking about how to restore his reputation and prestige, Su Yi received the notification from the program team. She said with a look of delight, “Our staff has already analyzed a portion of the video. Although it’s only a portion, according to the technical personnel, it’s already extremely exciting…”

“Cut to the chase. Quickly release the ultra slow-motion analysis!”

“I want to see the video. Please release it quickly.” “Goddess Su Yi, spare me. Quickly release the video, alright? My heart can’t take it!” Su Yi smiled and said, “I know no one wants to hear me now, but the program team is preparing to send the analysis over. Please wait a moment.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Soon, the program’s scene turned into a battle scene. Under the ultra slow-motion camera, the average audience finally saw the battle scene of Zhou Wen, Xiao, and company. Although the video had been slowed down significantly, the four of them still moved very quickly. Furthermore, as Jiuyang would occasionally emit the Sun God Light, causing the image to be rather inconsistent, the entire scene would often end up white.

From the intermittent scenes, one could tell that the trio was fighting a rather intense battle.

“Pay attention to Jiuyang’s palm. This palm looks simple, but it contains infinite profundity and future variability. Regardless of whether Deceit King defends, attacks, or dodges, Jiuyang’s subsequent changes can make Deceit King suffer… Look at Xiao’s finger… What a terrifying fellow… I can’t even predict where this finger will point… Old K’s sceptre technique is really ingenious… I’m afraid Deceit King will be in trouble next…” Professor Gu constantly explained according to the content displayed in the video. “Look, Deceit King has been pushed into a corner…” Zhou Wen’s projection appeared as Professor Gu hurriedly continued.

However, he couldn’t finish his sentence. The smile on his face gradually vanished, replaced by a look of shock.

From the way Jiuyang and company were attacking, Deceit King could only be in a disadvantaged position. He might even be severely injured.

Of course, as the battle was still in progress, Professor Gu knew that Deceit King wasn’t dead. Otherwise, he might even believe that Zhou Wen was doomed if he didn’t summon his Companion Beasts.

However, the content on the screen was the opposite of his explanation.
