Chapter 1358: Military Disaster

The situation wasn’t as bad as Zhou Wen imagined. This was because Luoyang’s defenses and emergency response were very well-planned. Furthermore, it was only the precursor to a calamity. The true Calamity hadn’t descended, so the losses weren’t too great.

Some ordinary citizens had been injured, although the number of deaths was still within single digits. This was also thanks to the rapid deployment of the Sunset Army.

The precursor to the Calamity didn’t come from Dragon Gate Grotto, but from Luoyang City itself.

Recently, ancient soldiers had often appeared in the ancient city ruins. At first, people thought that they had broken out from one of the dimensional zones.

It was later discovered that the ancient soldiers had crawled out from beneath the ancient city like ghosts. Their ever-increasing numbers made people realize that something was amiss.

After An Sheng, Qin Wufu, and company’s investigations, they confirmed that it was a sign that a Calamity-grade creature was about to appear.

However, up to now, they had yet to determine what kind of Calamity creature would appear. They didn’t know which dimensional zone it was from.

Luoyang had been known as the Ancient Capital for thirteen generations. There were multiple ancient cities in the underground ruins. No one knew how many soldiers and imperial generals were buried there.

The spectral soldiers that appeared all wore different clothes. They came from all ages. It was difficult to determine who had triggered their appearance.

Logically speaking, no matter how powerful the emperors and generals in ancient times were, they only had powers of the human world. They weren’t even Mythical, much less Calamity.

However, everything indicated that a Calamity-grade creature related to ancient soldiers was about to appear.

An Sheng and company perused through historical data, but they didn’t find out who the Calamity-grade existence was. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

This was because the spectral soldiers that appeared hadn’t reached a very high level. Some spectral generals were only at the Epic stage. Occasionally, a Mythical general would appear. The Sunset Army could still keep the situation under control, but as time passed, under the influence of the Calamity-grade creature, the spectral soldiers and generals’ levels would become higher and higher until the Calamity grade appeared and formed a terrifying military disaster. When that happened, it would probably be difficult to defend Luoyang.

Zhou Wen wasn’t confident that he could defeat a Calamity-grade, but when he thought of Sweetie beside him, he felt that there was still a chance.

Even God is by my side. I don’t believe that I can’t deal with a mere Calamity.?Zhou Wen didn’t continue wandering around as he headed straight for Luoyang with Sweetie. He couldn’t be bothered anymore.

Sweetie had been following Zhou Wen all this time, hoping to discover his flaws and find the truth about the candy box, so she naturally didn’t give up.

Before Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang, he saw a group of armored soldiers with spears wandering in the forest.

The soldiers’ armor was tattered and their bodies looked like zombies. They were ugly with many rotting spots.

However, they weren’t as stiff as zombies. Not only were they able to move freely, but they were also very agile.

When the soldiers saw Zhou Wen, they immediately charged forward. Zhou Wen slapped them in the air, immediately dismembering them and causing their flesh to fall to the ground.

However, one of the ancient soldiers, who had his lower body severed and only had its upper body left, was still crawling towards Zhou Wen with both hands. It looked extremely strange.

Zhou Wen struck again and blasted the ancient soldier’s body apart before killing him.

This place is still dozens of kilometers away from Luoyang City. Even soldiers have appeared here. From the looks of it, the Calamity is approaching.?Zhou Wen continued towards Luoyang City.

Along the way, he saw more and more ancient soldiers. When the numbers increased to the point of him not being able to quickly dispatch them, Zhou Wen decided to ignore them and continuously instant transmitted towards the city.

The vicinity of Luoyang had turned into an ancient battlefield. There were ancient soldiers everywhere. The closer they were to the city, the more ancient soldiers there were.

Zhou Wen saw from afar that the Sunset Army was relying on defensive fortifications to engage the soldiers in an intense battle. Gunshots sounded incessantly.

The bullets made of Essence Gold constantly shot into the ancient soldiers’ bodies, but the ancient soldiers continued charging at them crazily. Many bullets were needed to knock them to the ground.

Even if their heads exploded, the headless ancient soldiers would still charge over crazily.

The best way to kill them was to penetrate their hearts. As long as their hearts exploded, the ancient soldiers would fall to the ground and never get up again.

However, the ancient soldiers weren’t slow. It wasn’t easy to strike the heart.

Bullets whistled through the air and shells exploded from time to time. There were also Companion Beasts that charged into the battlefield and fought the ancient soldiers under the command of their owners. Although there weren’t any human casualties, it was already rather tragic.

From time to time, Companion Beasts would fall from their injuries or be summoned back by their owners.

Sweetie followed Zhou Wen and couldn’t help but frown when she saw this scene. She seemed extremely uncomfortable.

Zhou Wen returned to Overseer Manor. An Sheng was already waiting for him at the entrance, so he asked, “Ah Sheng, have you found the source of the Calamity-grade existence?”

An Sheng shook his head. “As we can’t find out which Calamity-grade creature it is, it’s very difficult to determine which dimensional zone it’s coming from. All we know now is that it’s definitely a dimensional zone in the dungeon. Deputy Governor Qin and I studied it and found four dimensional zones in the dungeon to be the most suspicious. We’ve already sent investigators out. We’re hoping for good news.”

The two of them chatted as they walked. Zhou Wen naturally knew that it was best to nip a Calamity-grade creature in the bud. If they didn’t allow it to appear, the damage it caused would naturally be minimized.

However, now that they didn’t even know which dimensional zone it came from, they clearly couldn’t count on this plan. The Sunset Army was actually already prepared to deal with the Calamity.

The only thing he was afraid of was that the Calamity creature would stay on Earth for too long. If they couldn’t hold out until it left Earth, Luoyang would be doomed.

Some even suggested that they temporarily evacuate Luoyang.

It may be easy for the Sunset Army and Zhou Wen to evacuate, but it wasn’t easy to evacuate the ordinary citizens.

It wasn’t that they couldn’t leave, but how could ordinary citizens survive outside without the city’s protection?

Now that there were break-out creatures everywhere outside, ordinary citizens had no chance of survival. Furthermore, the military couldn’t safely evacuate so many citizens.

“There’s another thorny problem. Due to the Calamity, we have no choice but to distribute our manpower. The Overseer Manor’s defense is much weaker. The fellows who wanted to get your help previously are now stirring. The Overseer Manor isn’t safe anymore.” An Sheng’s eyes were terrifyingly cold.
