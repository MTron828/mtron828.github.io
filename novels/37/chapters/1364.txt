Chapter 1365: Two Birds With One Stone

“Director-General Wei, go. As long as you are in Luoyang, Luoyang will become a dead city. No one will be able to escape. Everyone will sense the brilliance of Buddha and be sent to Paradise,” Hermit said to Wei Ge as he looked at the ancient soldiers crawling out of the ground.

“Although I’m very willing to sacrifice my life for the Federation, I still wish to remain useful and dedicate my life to the Federation and you. Therefore, I still wish to return alive.” Wei Ge didn’t budge his feet at all.

Hermit knew that it was impossible to get Wei Ge to take such a risk if he couldn’t convince him. Therefore, he explained, “The Censors who sacrificed themselves to Buddha are all your men. You were also the one who gave the order to let them enter Heaven. By using them as sacrifices, the bhikkhuni, who has awakened, is already tainted by their obsession. Although they haven’t reached the point of becoming devils, a sliver of a catalyst has been planted. As for you, you are the person who can spark off the catalyst because of that obsession. Therefore, as long as you are in Luoyang City, the bhikkhuni will definitely go to Luoyang City. Once she sees you and senses you, a person ridden with sin, becoming a devil is inevitable.

“Of course, you don’t have to worry. I’ve already prepared a path of retreat for you. When the bhikkhuni becomes a devil, it will be time for you to retreat with your job done,” Hermit said as he looked at Cave Era.

Cave Era took out a pocket watch and handed it to Wei Ge. “This is a temporal pocket watch I made. After bhikkhuni becomes a devil, you can use it to return to a designated time and place I set—the headquarters of our League of Guardians.”

“Thank you, Your Excellency Cave Era.” Wei Ge solemnly put away the pocket watch.

“Go. When I return to the headquarters, I’ll help your Balrog advance to the Terror grade. Your future achievements will be limitless,” Hermit said.

“I still have to thank the two of you for your help. I’ll go now.” Wei Ge took a few steps and suddenly turned his head. “Your Excellency, is there any taboo when using this temporal watch? I’m afraid I’ll use it wrongly later.”

“If you are worried, you can give it a try,” Cave Era said indifferently.

“Please enlighten me.” Wei Ge was very careful. How could he be careless in matters that determined life and death?

Cave Era gave him the usage details. Wei Ge pressed it and his body immediately vanished. After a few seconds, his figure appeared again.

“Your Excellency’s temporal powers are indeed divine. You can travel great distances in an instant. It’s like a god’s help,” praised Wei Ge.

“If there’s no problem, go quickly. The bhikkhuni is about to come out,” Cave Era said with a cold expression, as though she was very unhappy that Wei Ge hadn’t trusted her.

Wei Ge knew that she was unhappy, so he didn’t ask for a snub. He bowed and headed for Luoyang City.

After Wei Ge vanished into Luoyang City, Cave Era said, “You were right. This person is too cautious. Thankfully, the temporal pocket watch I gave him was real, or it would have been troublesome.”

“There’s nothing wrong with the temporal pocket watch, right?” Hermit asked.

“No problem. Everything is under my control. Without my power to activate it, the temporal pocket watch is useless. It’s useless even if he has it. Furthermore, he can let me know his location.” Cave Era hesitated for a moment before saying, “Why must he die? Although such a person is very annoying, he’s indeed very useful.”

“If he doesn’t die at the hands of the bhikkhuni, how can she truly become a devil?” Hermit said indifferently. “He’s just a dog. As long as we are willing, there will be more people willing to work for us at any time. Furthermore, he’s too ambitious. It’s not suitable for such a person to stay in this position for long. Otherwise, the bureau will become his private property. Must we go through him when we use the bureau in the future?”

Cave Era thought that it made sense. From this operation, it could be seen that Wei Ge’s title of Monarch Bee was definitely not groundless.

The Censors were almost subservient to Wei Ge. They even went against their orders. Without Wei Ge’s orders, it would probably be difficult for them to do anything.

“This time, we can deal with the An family in Luoyang and reshuffle the bureau. It will be killing two birds with one stone. We should celebrate later,” Hermit said with a smile. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

As the two of them spoke, the bhikkhuni had already walked out of the dungeon. At the instant she walked out, a large number of the undead crawled out of the ground in Luoyang.

Luoyang City was immediately thrown into pandemonium. The ancient soldiers outside could still withstand the attacks, but at their feet, many ancient soldiers suddenly crawled out. It immediately threw the Sunset Army into disarray. They began engaging in melee combat, and the battle situation became extremely tragic.

Just as Hermit had expected, the bhikkhuni headed for Luoyang City, as though she was pursuing Wei Ge.

Wherever she passed, the dead people who crawled out of the ground transformed into a Buddhistic glow that rose into the sky. Their faces revealed looks of relief as though they had been liberated.

As for the living people near her, they weren’t affected. When they saw this scene, the soldiers and experts guarding the city were overjoyed. They imagined that rescue had arrived.

“The present bhikkhuni will only redeem the dead, but after she becomes a devil, she will redeem the living as well. I hope they can still smile when that happens,” Hermit said indifferently.

“If An Tianzuo wasn’t so overbearing and domineering and ignorant of the times, he wouldn’t have implicated everyone in this city,” said Cave Era with a sigh.

“The success of a general is built up of ten thousand bones. Fate has never been one’s. If anything is to be blamed, blame them for following the wrong person,” Hermit said coldly and mercilessly.

The bhikkhuni walked towards Luoyang step by step. Large swaths of ancient soldiers were being sent to their deaths. When she arrived outside Luoyang City, people imagined that their savior had arrived. They opened the gates to welcome the bhikkhuni in.

“Humans are just that ignorant,” Hermit said with an odd expression.

After the bhikkhuni entered the city, the large number of undead that had crawled out of the ground was redeemed by her strength as they ascended to heaven. The pressure on them immediately decreased.

Although the power of the dead wasn’t enough to destroy Luoyang, they were everywhere. They could appear from anywhere, causing a huge impact on ordinary people. Even someone as strong as Li Xuan couldn’t ensure the safety of the entire Li family.

Many dead people crawled out from the ground. He couldn’t flatten the Li family’s residence with a single punch after all. Furthermore, many people from the Li family were fighting the dead.

The bhikkhuni’s power ignored everything and purified the dead, sending them to heaven. As for the living, they weren’t injured at all.

“Stay happy. The happier you are now, the more miserable you will cry in a while.” Hermit snorted coldly and asked Cave Era, “Where’s Wei Ge?”

“Somewhere closer to the back.” Cave Era sensed the location of the pocket watch.

“Why did he run so far?” Hermit frowned slightly.

“He probably doesn’t dare to approach Overseer Manor too closely for fear of being discovered. It’s good to be careful to prevent him from being discovered and chased out,” said Cave Era.

The two of them could only watch bhikkhuni walk across the streets and redeem large swaths of the undead. She walked faster and faster, and her strength increased. She was almost completely transformed.
