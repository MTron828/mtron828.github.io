Chapter 694: Holy Hell King

Translator: CKtalon

When Zhou Wen drew his saber to kill the Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals, the girl watched from the side as though she was observing Zhou Wen’s movement technique. Then, she compared it to her own movement technique and continued practicing.

After Zhou Wen killed the Demonized Soldiers, invisible flames were immediately sucked into the Hell King’s Eye. However, the quantity was lacking. It was much less than the invisible flames he had obtained from killing the monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird. It was like the difference between a drop of water and a pool of water.

However, a tower could be formed simply by piling sand. By killing more Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals, he could accumulate a significant amount of invisible flames.

Perhaps it was because he had obtained a lot of invisible flames from before, Zhou Wen felt his body begin to undergo a strange change after killing a few Demonized Soldiers.

Invisible flames flowed out of the Hell King’s Eye, enveloping his body in invisible flames. Under the baptism of the invisible flames, the Hell King Life Soul underwent a complete transformation.

However, the invisible flames couldn’t be seen. The students nearby couldn’t tell the changes in Zhou Wen’s body.

The Hell King Life Soul was Zhou Wen’s body. When the Hell King Life Soul evolved, Zhou Wen’s body also changed.

His body became extremely sensitive. Zhou Wen could even sense a speck of dust landing on him, and this level of spiritual perception and touch made him feel uncomfortable.

This feeling wasn’t very good because the air was filled with dust and bacteria. It was fine back when he couldn’t feel or see them.

But now, he could only watch as the dust landed on his face, eyes, and even on his lips. There were also the worm-like bacteria. As they entered Zhou Wen’s nose and mouth through his breathing, he felt terrible.

The invisible flames couldn’t injure any creature, nor could it stop anything from approaching Zhou Wen. The invisible flames didn’t seem to exist at all.

However, it made Zhou Wen’s Hell King Life Soul become stronger and stronger. Finally, even the Hell King’s Eye changed.

In the past, the Hell King’s Eye was only a spatial rift. There was no pupil inside, but as the Hell King’s Life Soul transformed, a pupil-like bead gradually condensed in the Hell King’s Eye.

The bead was condensed from invisible flames. It was formless and corporeal, making it look extremely strange. It was like a transparent pupil that floated in the Hell King’s Eye.

Finally, the Hell King Life Soul completed its evolution. The Hell King’s Eye also had a transparent pupil. The pupil burned with invisible flames, making it look strange and mysterious.

The invisible flames on his body subsided as some mysterious information surged into Zhou Wen’s mind, allowing him to gain some information regarding the evolution of the Hell King Life Soul.

However, Zhou Wen still switched on his phone and read the blood-colored avatar’s information.

Holy Hell King (Evolved Body): The King of Hell who cleanses away sin.

Zhou Wen roughly knew that the Hell King’s Eye had the effect of cleansing sin, but he still needed to give it a try to know its exact power. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Zhou Wen gave it a try to see how powerful the upgraded Holy Hell King was.

He looked at a Demonized Soldier with the Hell King’s Eye. The invisible karmic sinflames in his eyes immediately burned.

The invisible karmic flames on the Demonized Soldier’s body were triggered. It burst into flames as the invisible karmic sinflames on its body became even thicker.

It looked very powerful. The invisible karmic flames on the Demon Soldier’s body grew thicker, but they didn’t seem to affect the Demonized Soldier at all.

The Demonized Soldier looked normal. It didn’t seem to hurt in any spot. It didn’t even blink.

Holy sh*t, how can it be useless? Could it be that the Demonized Soldier has already been secretly injured and will die after taking seven steps? Zhou Wen stared at the Demonized Soldier for a while to see if it would suddenly collapse.

As Zhou Wen watched, he counted the Demonized Soldier’s steps. One step... Two steps... Three steps...

He watched as the Demonized Soldier finished seven steps. Suddenly, the Demonized Soldier’s body paused.

No way! I actually guessed right. It’ll die in seven steps? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.

However, to his surprise, the Demonized Soldier stopped and farted before continuing to wander.

Zhou Wen’s face immediately darkened. Without any hesitation, he killed the Demonized Soldier with one strike and swallowed the invisible flames on its body.

What the hell. After all this trouble, this Holy Hell King’s ability is useless, Zhou Wen thought gloomily.

Although Zhou Wen knew that the Eye of the Holy Hell King was definitely useful, it didn’t seem to be suitable for mainstream use. He didn’t know what its exact use was.

Forget it. I’ll continue absorbing the invisible flames. I’ll advance the Hell King to a Perfect Body first. Zhou Wen continued killing monsters to obtain the invisible flames.

For the next few days, Zhou Wen absorbed the invisible karmic flames at Tiger Cage Pass. Finally, he charged into Tiger Cage Pass and killed the Tiger Cage Demonized General and the Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet.

However, the invisible karmic flames that these Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals could provide were far inferior to the monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird. Despite Zhou Wen absorbing so much, the Holy Hell King didn’t react at all. It showed no signs of advancement again.

Reality wasn’t a game. After killing the Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals inside, he had no choice but to slowly wait for new Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals to come out of the dimensional rift. He didn’t know how many days he would have to wait, so Zhou Wen naturally wanted to head out. He planned on changing locations to continue grinding the invisible karmic sinflames.

Just as he was about to leave, he saw a female student enter deep inside Tiger Cage Pass and kill many Demonized Soldiers. Finally, she encountered a Demonized General and was fighting it.

Zhou Wen didn’t pay her much attention and was about to leave when he realized that her movement technique looked familiar. He took a careful look.

He immediately realized that the girl was someone he knew. She was the female freshman who had come here with Li Weiyang a few days ago. Zhou Wen had even taught her some basic techniques of Transcendent Flying Immortal.

After not seeing her for a few days, the girl had already mastered the techniques. She fought the Demonized General alone and used the techniques that Zhou Wen had taught her to constantly move about, preventing the Demonized General from touching her. Instead, she constantly injured it.

Unfortunately, she was only at the Mortal stage. She didn’t even have a Companion Beast, nor did she learn any Essence Energy Skills. Every strike on the Demonized General only dealt limited damage.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown slightly. He had told the girl that she lacked strength and needed to raise her strength to kill the Demonized General, but to his surprise, she had come alone.

She also knew that her attacks were lacking, so she wasn’t greedy. She wanted to cause severe damage by constantly accumulating damage.

However, she had neglected the fact that her Essence Energy and stamina were lacking. After a prolonged battle, her speed and strength declined.

Finally, the girl’s speed decreased drastically. She failed to dodge the Demonized General’s charge and was about to be hit.
