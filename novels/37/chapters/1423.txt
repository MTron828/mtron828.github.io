Chapter 1424: Reaching the Peak With Seven Stars

“So that’s how it is. Human Sovereign aimed to kill the Calamity gunner. Unfortunately, he underestimates it too much. This is the home ground of the Calamity gunner to begin with. Even existences like Tsukuyomi, Xiao, and The Fallen found it difficult to find the location of the Calamity gunner. They could only choose to obtain as high a score as possible instead of killing it. The possibility of Human Sovereign successfully killing the Calamity gunner is slim, so it’s reasonable that the attack missed…” Professor Gu’s analysis was as most people thought.

However, before Professor Gu could finish his sentence, inch by inch, Human Sovereign pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword that was embedded in the wall.

As the Immortal Culling Sword was pulled out, energy spewed out like flames from the gap between the sword and the wall, illuminating the entire tunnel.

“No… No way…” In the Holy Land, the Saints widened their eyes in disbelief.

Professor Gu, who was commenting, had his mouth agape, but he couldn’t finish his sentence. All he could do was watch as the light on the Cube’s screen intensified. The light reflected in his pupils nearly filled his entire eyes.

Boom!

When the Immortal Culling Sword was completely pulled out, the energy source that spewed out exploded, blasting apart the metal wall. A humanoid metal creature’s chest exploded as the energy source shattered. It fell out of the blasted wall and collapsed in front of Zhou Wen.

A metal crystal dropped from his blasted chest. Zhou Wen picked it up and turned to walk towards the Golden Palace.

Without any Calamity-grade bullets appearing again, Zhou Wen walked up to the Golden Palace under everyone’s stunned gazes.

However, before reaching the Golden Palace, Zhou Wen switched to his Terror form. He had already experimented before. The Golden Palace relied on two aspects to rate the challenger.

Firstly, it was bloodline. If he dripped his blood in before entering, judgment would be based on his bloodline. Another attempt would only raise his stars and ranking, and he wouldn’t be given a metal ball.

However, other than dripping blood to enter the Venusian dimensional zone, one could also enter using spatial powers. As creatures that entered like this didn’t have any reference bloodline, the Venusian dimensional zone determined a rating using Life Providences, Life Souls, Wheel of Destiny, and Terror transformation powers.

Zhou Wen had dripped his blood the last time he came in. The Terror transformation powers he used when he stepped up were The Disqualified, Singularity Universe, and Godfiend Era.

This time, Zhou Wen had used spatial powers to enter. He had converted all his attributes to Human Sovereign’s before ascending the Golden Palace.

The Golden Palace’s door opened again as a blinding light shone from within. A metal ball slowly flew out and landed in front of Zhou Wen.

The Cube’s scene changed and switched to the rankings. Everyone looked eagerly at the top of the rankings. When they saw the two words in their imagination, they felt an indescribable feeling in their hearts. It was as though it was only natural for it to appear, but it was also unbelievable. It was complicated and difficult to describe.

Then, everyone quickly swept their gazes behind the name.

One… Two… Three…?Someone counted silently in his heart. Someone directly counted out loud. Even if they were not physically in the same place, they were unbelievably in sync.

“Four… Five… Six… Seven… Stars…” Someone finally couldn’t help but shout hoarsely,” Seven stars… Human Sovereign has seven stars… F*ck… It’s seven stars… Who the hell said that Human Sovereign can’t get first place…”

“Professor Gu, what are your thoughts?” The host couldn’t help but ask the stunned Professor Gu. As a fan of Human Sovereign, she was very displeased with Professor Gu’s previous analysis. If it wasn’t because of her professional ethics, she would have long retorted.

“This… is indeed a little unexpected…” Professor Gu couldn’t think of anything to say, so he coughed awkwardly.

“Haha, as expected, our Human Sovereign is invincible. What Saint Xiao? What’s so awesome about him? If he has the ability, kill the Calamity gunner.”

“I knew it. I knew that Human Sovereign would definitely do it. As Human Sovereign, wouldn’t killing a Calamity be child’s play?”

“That’s not right. That wasn’t what you said a moment ago?”

…

“How did this happen? Didn’t Lord Holy God say that it’s virtually impossible for Calamity-grade creatures to kill the Calamity gunner in the Venusian dimensional zone? How did he do it?” A Saint was still in disbelief as he looked at the seven golden stars behind Human Sovereign’s name with a look of appalled surprise.

“Lord Holy God only said that it’s virtually impossible, but that’s not an ordinary person,” Xiao said indifferently.

“But what do we do now? Lord Holy God said that we have to obtain first place and obtain the Venusian Companion Beast… Now…” the Saint said in a panic.

Thinking of the consequences of Holy God’s wrath, many Saints trembled slightly.

“What do you mean what should we do? Can’t I just snatch back first place? Since Lord Holy God chose me, I naturally have to do the deed well. If Human Sovereign can do it, I can also do it,” Xiao said as he walked towards the Cube.

“Well said. Just snatch it back.” A voice sounded from a distant palace. A holy deity walked over step by step. Wherever he passed, all the Saints genuflected. No one dared to look at him.

“Lord Holy God.” Xiao also genuflected.

“Not only do I want you to snatch back first place, but I also want you to kill that human. Can you do it?” Holy God asked as he looked down at Xiao.

“If there’s a chance, I’ll do my best,” Xiao said in a deep voice.

“I can give you a chance, but failure is not an option,” said Holy God.

“Only one of us will live,” Xiao answered firmly.

“Remember your words. If Human Sovereign doesn’t die, don’t even bother returning.” Holy God walked towards the Cube. When he stood on the Cube, the entire Cube lit up.

Everyone looked at the ranking on the Cube and discussed what Companion Beast Human Sovereign would obtain.

The Cube that had already switched to the ranking screen suddenly changed again. It returned to the scene in the Venusian dimensional zone.

Furthermore, the scene didn’t show the entrance to the Venusian dimensional zone. It was still the scene in front of the Golden Palace. Zhou Wen was still standing in front of the Golden Palace and hadn’t been teleported out. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“What’s going on?” Everyone was somewhat puzzled.

This was unprecedented. Furthermore, the countdown hadn’t ended. There were still dozens of minutes left. It was still premature to say that Human Sovereign had obtained first place.

Zhou Wen realized that he hadn’t been teleported out of the Golden Palace and knew that something was amiss. He immediately wanted to use spatial teleportation to leave the Golden Palace, but he realized that the space in the Golden Palace was isolated from the outside world. He couldn’t teleport out.

At the same time, a figure entered the Venusian dimensional zone. It was none other than Xiao.

Everyone immediately understood what had happened. The entire Federation broke into a furor.

“F*ck, again? Do you have any shame? It was Di Tian the last time. This time, it’s the Holy Land. If you can’t win, play dirty. Is everyone from the dimension so shameless?”
