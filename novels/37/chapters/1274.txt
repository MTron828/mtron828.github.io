Chapter 1275: That Sword Looks Familiar

Translator: CKtalon

Seeing that the one fighting Seraph was a metal flower, even Cave Era and company in the League of Guardians were very surprised.

“Plant-type dimensional creatures have always been relatively weak. Even if they have some kind of ability, they can only be effective in certain areas. This plant on Venus can actually fight the six-winged seraphim. I wonder what kind of origin it has,” Blood Shaman said.

Hermit stared at the flower for a while before saying emotionally, “That flower looks like the legendary Withered Flower.”

“What’s Withered Flower?” Blood Shaman asked in puzzlement.

Cave Era looked at the metal flower on the projection and said, “Legend has it that every Withered Flower represents a single life. At the end of that life, the Withered Flower will wither. Therefore, the Withered Flower is actually the Flower of Life. It can control life and death. However, the Withered Flower should be of natural origins. This metal body doesn’t seem right.”

Hermit thought for a moment and said, “There is indeed something amiss, but it really looks like a Withered Flower.”

Immortal, who was sitting on the seat of honor, finally spoke. When he spoke, everyone fell silent. Even people like Blood Shaman and Cave Era didn’t dare make a sound, afraid that they would interrupt him.

“That’s the legendary Withered Flower. However, it’s not a normal Withered Flower. If I’m not wrong, someone must have brought the seed of the Withered Flower from Earth to Venus, allowing it to absorb the metallic elements of Venus and grow. It mutated, resulting in such a strange Withered Flower,” Immortal said slowly.

“Who has the ability to not only find a Withered Flower, but also bring it to Venus and let it grow in such an environment without dying?” Hermit found it an insurmountable task.

“Who knows? However, he must be an extremely interesting person,” Immortal said with piqued interest.

At that moment, the metal flower began to show its might. From the tower-like pillar, flower roots extended out.

Although the flower was tiny and could be held with one hand, its roots were unimaginably huge. They were like dragons as they tore through the rocks and drilled out from the ground, causing the ground to crack. The rocks flipped open as the mountain range constantly trembled like a magnitude 12 earthquake.

Flower roots extended out and covered an area of hundreds of kilometers. Some of them curled towards the mountains and uprooted them.

Rumble! Rumble!

The mountain peaks shattered as though an invisible force had blasted all the mountain peaks and rocks into tiny particles. Wherever the flower roots passed, the entire space trembled violently.

It wasn’t an earthquake, but space in its entirety was trembling.

Everyone was dumbfounded. They had never seen such a ferocious plant before. It was like an interstellar monster. Just a random root from it could shatter a mountain. What terrifying strength was this?

Now, many people were secretly glad that this battle hadn’t happened on Earth. Otherwise, many humans would definitely be implicated.

Just as everyone was shocked by the metal flower’s terrifying strength, the woman attacked again. The Blazing Flame Sword in her hand slashed down again.

However, her target this time wasn’t the Chaos Egg, but the metal flower.

The metal flower also sensed the danger. The flower roots swept towards the Blazing Flame Sword like metal monsters, attempting to block it. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, when the Blazing Flame Sword slashed at the flower roots, it was like slicing through tofu as it sliced through the terrifying dragon-like flower roots.

Any flower roots that touched the Blazing Flame Sword melted instantly, turning into liquid metal that fell to the ground.

Boom!

The stone pillar, which was already more than a thousand meters tall and resembled a giant tower, was split in half by the Blazing Flame Sword and collapsed to both sides.

The leaves beside the metal flower were chopped off. Almost all the roots below were severed and burned.

“Her Excellency Seraph is invincible!”

“This is a true angel, an omnipotent Emissary of God.”

“She killed such a terrifying monster with one strike. As expected of the strongest Seraph!”

People exclaimed in amazement and marveled at the strength of the six-winged seraphim. Many believers treated the woman as a true seraph.

At that moment, at the end of the chasm, a person walked out of the rubble. He held the hilt of his sword in one hand and the scabbard in the other. His aura was almost nonexistent.

Just now, the Chaos Egg had been cleaved by the strike and slammed hundreds of kilometers away. This chasm was created by the Chaos Egg.

Zhou Wen was originally worried that the Chaos Egg wouldn’t be able to withstand the powerful impact and would be sliced apart. Even he wouldn’t be spared.

In fact, the Chaos Egg was ultimately destroyed. Thankfully, the remaining force was blocked by the Prisoned Dragon armor with Absolute Defense.

However, before it shattered, the Chaos Egg had already converted a massive amount of solid Essence Energy to supplement the Immortal Culling Sword’s needs.

Even so, the Immortal Culling Sword didn’t immediately stop after absorbing all the Essence Energy in Zhou Wen’s body. It only truly stopped when it was done.

Zhou Wen had been in for a shock with Slaughterer about to be drained. Thankfully, the Immortal Culling Sword was finally satisfied and stopped devouring his Essence Energy.

Zhou Wen wore the Prisoned Dragon armor and held the Immortal Culling Sword as he walked towards the woman.

Just as people were exclaiming the strength of the seraphim, they suddenly realized that the figure had turned its head and was looking in a direction as though it was staring at something.

“Is there something over there?” People were somewhat puzzled, but they didn’t find anything suspicious on the projection. There were snapped roots and shattered rocks everywhere.

…

At the bureau, Wei Ge’s heart stirred as he instructed, “Old Xu, adjust the satellite angle and see if you can see the end of the chasm.”

Old Xu immediately adjusted the data. Soon, the scene changed. After swiveling a few times, they suddenly saw a figure walking in the chasm.

“Zoom in.” Wei Ge’s eyes focused as he ordered again.

Old Xu and the staff did the adjustments again. The scene gradually magnified and became clearer.

“That’s a person… The sword in his hand looks familiar… Human Sovereign…” After Old Xu saw the scene, he immediately jumped up from his chair and pointed at the screen without closing his mouth.

“Interesting.” Wei Ge narrowed his eyes in thought. Moments later, Wei Ge gave another order. “Send the signal to the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau. Aren’t they livestreaming? Contact them and get them to use our signal source.”

Although they were puzzled as to why Wei Ge was doing this, Wei Ge’s words were like an imperial edict in the bureau. No one dared to question him. Old Xu immediately contacted the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau.

When the editor-in-chief of the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau saw the signal that Old Xu had sent over, he also jumped up from his chair.. His fat body had never been so agile. He stood on the chair and pointed at the screen for a long time before saying, “Holy sh*t… Human Sovereign…”
