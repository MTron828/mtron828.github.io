Chapter 1116: Niten Flying Immortal Palace

Translator: CKtalon

When Wu Zonglie and company heard her say that, they suddenly felt that it made sense.

Seeing that they seemed to believe her, Ji Moqing struck while the iron was hot and continued, “Now, my master has gone to the top of the mountain to get the Elixir of Immortality. When he comes down with the Elixir and doesn’t see me, you will be in trouble. Therefore, if you release me now and kneel down politely to apologize, I can even put in a few good words for you and spare your lives.”

However, Wu Zonglie didn’t believe her. He sneered and said, “Then shout. Get your Human Sovereign master to kill us.”

Ji Moqing was still too young after all. She complained in her heart. Wu Zonglie had suffered once, so it seemed like he didn’t believe her at all. It wouldn’t be easy to fool him again.

When Wu Zonglie saw Ji Moqing’s gaze, he knew that his guess was definitely right. He was delighted as he said with a smile, “Ignoring the fact that Human Sovereign can’t be here, even if he was, I would definitely make sure he doesn’t return. It’s good to know how powerful I, Martial Fanatic, am. Perhaps the two of you will kneel down and beg for mercy together.”

Wu Zonglie naturally said all this to vent his anger on Ji Moqing. He wasn’t really that arrogant.

The people beside him echoed, “Human Sovereign defeated Di Tian. Lord Martial Fanatic, if you defeat Human Sovereign, it will be a beautiful story of the new generation replacing the old. I believe Human Sovereign will be gratified.”

Zhou Wen listened from the mountaintop for a long time. In the beginning, he didn’t know who the Human Sovereign they were talking about was. Only when he heard the last sentence did he suddenly realize that they were talking about him. He couldn’t help but be at a loss whether to laugh or cry.

When did I become Human Sovereign? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. Furthermore, he wasn’t sure what era it was.

He had kept track of time himself when he was trapped. It felt like more than a hundred years had passed, but from the looks of it, it hadn’t been that long for these people.

At this point, Ji Moqing could only persist with her lie. She forced herself to calm down and said, “Aren’t you afraid that my master will destroy your Niten Flying Immortal Palace in a fit of anger?”

Wu Zonglie opened his mouth to say something, but he suddenly widened his eyes in horror.

“Are you afraid now? Let go of me quickly. You might still have a chance of survival later...” As Ji Moqing spoke, she suddenly felt that something was amiss.

This was because Wu Zonglie and company weren’t looking at her, but at the other side of the mountain wall.

Ji Moqing, who was sandwiched by Wu Zonglie, also looked up and was instantly alarmed. She saw a masked man standing at the protruding part of the mountain wall and looking over.

“Who did you say was to kneel and beg for mercy?” Zhou Wen wore the Moonlit Rabbit mask as he stared at Wu Zonglie and asked coldly.

Wu Zonglie thought to himself, How can there be such a coincidence? There hasn’t been any news of Human Sovereign for five years. To think that Ji Moqing would encounter Human Sovereign and be taken in as a disciple? It must be fake.

In fact, even Ji Moqing didn’t believe that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign. She also knew that it couldn’t be such a coincidence.

With a thought, Ji Moqing deliberately shouted, “Master Human Sovereign, quickly save me. These bad people are bullying me.”

She believed that Zhou Wen was deliberately cooperating with her to act as Human Sovereign to save her, so she immediately cooperated.

Wu Zonglie sized up Zhou Wen and asked, “Are you really Human Sovereign?”

“No,” Zhou Wen answered.

Upon hearing that, Wu Zonglie secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Although he felt that Zhou Wen was definitely not Human Sovereign, he couldn’t help but have second thoughts. After all, this was indeed a coincidence: Zhou Wen had appeared when Ji Moqing said that Human Sovereign was here and he wore a mask that resembled the one Human Sovereign had worn in the video.

“Then are you standing up for her?” Wu Zonglie asked again.

“No.” Zhou Wen shook his head again.

Wu Zonglie and company couldn’t help but be taken aback. Ji Moqing also wore a look of surprise. She originally imagined that Zhou Wen had come out to save her, but his words left her dumbfounded.

“Then why are you here?” Wu Zonglie asked with a frown.

“That saber is mine.” Zhou Wen pointed at the Bamboo Blade in Wu Zonglie’s hand.

An idea came to Ji Moqing’s mind as she immediately shouted excitedly, “Master, I really didn’t lose your saber on purpose. They snatched it away by force. I’m too weak and can’t protect your saber. I don’t deserve to be your disciple...”

Wu Zonglie and company immediately looked at Zhou Wen warily. Although they didn’t believe that Zhou Wen was the true Human Sovereign, since he was the owner of the saber, it was possible that he was related to Ji Moqing. Otherwise, why would the saber be in Ji Moqing’s hands?

“Who are you?” Wu Zonglie stared at Zhou Wen and asked.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to explain further to them. He tapped his foot on the mountain wall and flew towards Wu Zonglie, hoping to retrieve the Bamboo Blade.

When Wu Zonglie and company saw Zhou Wen approach, they immediately drew their swords to meet the enemy.

These people were using tachi swords, and they were dual wielding. The moment they used their saber moves, Zhou Wen immediately felt a sense of familiarity. There was a faint inkling of Transcendent Flying Immortal.

However, it wasn’t purely Transcendent Flying Immortal. There was only an inkling of it. Zhou Wen seemed to have some impression of the other portion.

After some thought, Zhou Wen recalled where he had seen similar moves.

Back when he was still schooling at Sunset College, Zhou Wen had once gamed in a stone pavilion in Peony Garden, but he had ended up encountering an old man and a young man. The youth had insisted on competing with him.

In the end, the elder fought Zhou Wen and even used a very special Essence Energy Art. Not only did he fail to defeat Zhou Wen, but he even helped him condense the Dao Sutra Life Soul. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Zhou Wen didn’t remember the names of the old and young duo, but he still remembered condensing a Life Soul and the concept of withering that the elder had used.

The two of them had seen him use Transcendent Flying Immortal, but back then, Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal wasn’t as mature as it was now.

It’s no wonder I felt that the concept of Transcendent Flying Immortal in their saber techniques wasn’t perfect. So that’s how it is. It’s probably because the old and young duo fused it into their saber techniques after seeing that move... Zhou Wen had roughly figured out the cause and effect.

However, he didn’t stop. He kept advancing and retreating amidst the saber beams of Wu Zonglie and company. By the time he retreated, the Bamboo Blade had already returned to his hand.

The expressions of Wu Zonglie and company changed drastically to nastiness. Regardless of whether the person in front of them was Human Sovereign, he was an extremely terrifying figure. At the very least, his movement techniques were not something they could match.

Wu Zonglie introduced himself, “We are disciples of the Sword Sage of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. May I know who you are? Why are you making an enemy of us?”
