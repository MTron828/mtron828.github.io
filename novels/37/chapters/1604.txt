Chapter 1605 Grand Void Lightning Art

The Teacher Domain couldn’t completely seal a perfected domain. A perfected domain would constantly leave trajectories in the Teacher Domain like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. As the power in the Teacher Domain constantly changed, the puzzle would become more and more complete.

In the beginning, Zhou Wen didn’t sense much of it, but as the trajectories became more and more complete, he realized that they seemed to be changing

Zhou Wen had been fighting the Void Salamander for so long that he didn’t know how many times he had been struck by lightning. The trajectories that resembled a jigsaw puzzle became more and more completed as they seemed to emit a rhythm.

What will happen if I complete those trajectories? Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that this might be an opportunity.

Zhou Wen couldn’t think of a way to break out for the time being, so he decided to attempt to piece together the trajectories. The power sealed by the Teacher Domain wouldn’t leave a trajectory in the Teacher Domain-only powers that couldn’t be sealed would leave a trajectory. However, for the same power, some trajectories overlapped, while others didn’t.

Only the trajectories that didn’t overlap would become part of the jigsaw puzzle. The overlapping trajectories were useless.

What Zhou Wen needed to do was obtain more non-overlapping trajectories to connect all the trajectories together to form a huge net.

The trajectories produced by the same attack often overlapped. Zhou Wen had to make the Teacher Domain come into contact with the other party’s domain to obtain more trajectories. However, under the attack of the Void Salamander, Zhou Wen found it difficult to protect himself. It was extremely dangerous to make more contact with its domain.

Old K and company had been paying attention to Zhou Wen’s battle with the Void Salamander. Seeing that Zhou Wen was about to fight the Void Salamander to the death, Old K said, “Zhou Wen is like a trapped beast. From the looks of it, we will soon complete the mission.”

“It should be soon,” Xiao said indifferently as he thought to himself. With Jiuyang and Old K here, it’s probably impossible to secretly help Zhou Wen escape. Is it worth exposing my identity for him?

Xiao wasn’t a hesitant person, but at that moment, he was somewhat hesitant.

It was almost impossible to infiltrate the Holy Land. Unless it was a coincidence, it was impossible for him to enter the Holy Land to become a Saint. It was even harder to reach his status. If his identity was exposed, everything he had done previously would be in vain.

If it were any other time, Xiao wouldn’t hesitate to sacrifice Zhou Wen. However, when he thought of what An Tianzuo had said to him, Xiao hesitated.

Just as Xiao was hesitating, changes happened to the battle.

The Void Salamander originally had the absolute advantage with its lightning powers enveloping Zhou Wen. Under the bombardment of the lightning, more and more lightning bolts appeared in the Chaos Egg’s crevices as though it was about to explode.

Suddenly, the lightning domain released by the Void Salamander seemed to weaken. The sea-like lightning also decreased. “Why is the lightning on the Void Salamander decreasing?” Old K also discovered this situation and frowned.

“From the looks of it, Zhou Wen is going all out. This is the last bit of brilliance before his death,” Xiao said.

Jiuyang continued, “The Void Salamander’s lightning isn’t ordinary lightning. Instead of calling it lightning, it’s more like a clash of void powers. You might be capable of melting the void power away even with the use of the Holy Artifact.”

“Thankfully, we didn’t join the battle. Otherwise, we might have been in danger in this caged battle with Zhou Wen.” Xiao nodded.

Old K looked at the battling Zhou Wen and felt that what Xiao and Jiuyang said made sense, but he had a nagging feeling that something was amiss.

On the battlefield, Zhou Wen had already pieced together the trajectories in the Teacher Domain, forming a complete net.

The moment the net was mended, the entire net’s trajectories lit up and emitted a strange glow.

Of course, only Zhou Wen could see this glow

—something that only existed in the Teacher Domain itself.

As the trajectories emitted a glow, they began to change, turning into strange runes.

Zhou Wen couldn’t read them, but he knew what they meant, just like the words in the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.

The trajectory-transformed runes constantly flew towards the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, gradually forming scripture text one after another.

Great Void Lightning Art! Zhou Wen vaguely comprehended the true meaning of the words and realized that it was an Essence Energy Art.

As the trajectories transformed into scriptures, the Teacher Domain’s seal on the lightning became stronger and stronger.

This resulted in the situation Old K and company saw. The lightning released by the Void Salamander was constantly decreasing. The lightning wasn’t melted by Zhou Wen, but the power of the Teacher Domain had sealed the corresponding rules of the void lightning. In the beginning, Old K believed that this was Zhou Wen’s final gamble or his final brilliance before his death.

Old K felt that something was amiss as large swaths of void lightning vanished until the biggest one disappeared.

“No good. That’s not Zhou Wen’s final burst of strength. He found a way to restrain the void lightning!” Xiao shouted in horror, “But how is this possible? How can a Human Realm like him restrain a Heaven-level domain?” “That fellow is indeed difficult to figure out,” Jiuyang said in thought.

“Attack together. We can’t give him any chance. We have to retrieve the Holy Artifact,” Old K said as he rushed into the battlefield. He held a scepter in his hand and pointed at Zhou Wen, who was being pursued by the Void Salamander.

The tip of the scepter emitted a strange glow. Wherever the light shone, Zhou Wen’s Teacher Domain converged significantly.

Xiao and Jiuyang charged in as well. Jiuyang’s body emitted divine light as he punched Zhou Wen. Divine light erupted as though it wanted to penetrate the universe. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xiao appeared behind the Chaos Egg like a ghost and struck it, sending it flying. A large number of solid crystals condensed in the Chaos Egg. As for the Great Void Lightning Art’s scripture that appeared in the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, it had already ended. In the Teacher Domain, all the void lightning powers were sealed, making all the lightning vanish without a trace. Even the Void Salamander’s body transformed from lightning to flesh.

It resembled the tiny Void Salamander that Zhou Wen had killed. It had white jade-like scales and snow-white butterfly wings. Although its body was huge, its speed was astonishing

Unable to release the power of the void lightning, the Void Salamander could only fight using its body. Even so, the same power remained circulating in its body-it just couldn’t be released. Its speed and strength didn’t weaken, and it remained extremely ferocious.
