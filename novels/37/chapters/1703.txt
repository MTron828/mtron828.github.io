Chapter 1704 It’s Time to Return It

“A third of the Ancient City’s profits?” Li Xuan looked at Pata as though he was looking at a lunatic.

Pata clearly didn’t believe that he was a lunatic. He said with great confidence, “Don’t think that a third of the profits is a lot. If I lend my Companion Beast to Karoman, with his personality, he definitely won’t let this matter rest after suffering such humiliation. He might even hunt you down. When that happens, you’d even lose your life. What’s the point of having more money and resources?

“Therefore, wanting a third of the profits isn’t excessive. It can even be said to be a very reasonable price. This is also on account of your good relationship with some of the members of our Ultimate Family Clan. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come here to negotiate with you. If I were to directly negotiate with Karoman, it would definitely be more than this price,” Pata said eloquently as though everything was under his control.

Zhou Wen only looked at Pata with interest without saying a word.

Li Xuan said in exasperation and amusement, “Your analysis is very accurate, but are you really sure that a Companion Beast can do what you just said?”

“I knew you wouldn’t believe me, but it’s fine. I can prove to you that my Companion Beast is worth this price,” said Pata as he summoned the Anasrava Gold Turtle.

It was a huge turtle made of gold. It lay motionless in front of Pata like a golden statue.

The Anasrava Gold Turtle looked somewhat different from ordinary turtles. Its back was as smooth as a mirror, without any patterns that a turtle shell should have. Its limbs, head, and tail formed a unibody.

Li Xuan looked at it for a long time and felt that it didn’t look like a turtle. Instead, it looked like a softshell turtle.

Before Li Xuan could voice his thoughts, Pata transformed the Anasrava Gold Turtle into golden armor and put it on.

“You shouldn’t be unfamiliar with this armor, right? Previously, the reason why Karoman was able to successfully clear the long staircase in front of Alkaid Star Palace was that he had borrowed my Anasrava Gold Turtle. And its abilities are far from that. If you don’t believe me, you can use the taboo power that can eliminate the Sun God powers to see if it’s effective against my Anasrava Gold Turtle,” said Pata confidently.

“It’s just a turtle shell. Do you really think…” Li Xuan was about to say something teasing when he was interrupted by Zhou Wen.

“Your turtle’s name is Anasrava Gold Turtle?” Zhou Wen wasn’t angry at all as he sized up the golden turtle with interest.

“That’s right. It’s stronger than when I lent it to Karoman. It has already reached the Hell level.” Pata was somewhat smug.

He indeed had the right to be smug. In this era, the number of people who could possess Hell-level Companion Beasts could be counted on one hand.

“Anasrava should be a Buddhist saying. Buddhism has the so-called Anasrava Wisdom. It refers to witnessing the truth, a wisdom gained from abandoning all worries and disobedience. It’s also known as Buddha Wisdom. Such a Companion Beast shouldn’t be from the North District, right?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the Anasrava Gold Turtle. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

In order to cultivate the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, he had studied the Buddhist Sutra for a period of time. Although he wasn’t proficient in it, he knew something related to Buddhism.

The word ‘Anasrava’ represented perfection. It was a manifestation of great wisdom in Buddhism. To be able to use the name ‘Anasrava’ meant that this turtle was probably extraordinary.

However, what really intrigued Zhou Wen wasn’t its name, but because the aura of the Anasrava Gold Turtle was somewhat different from ordinary Buddhist-type Companion Beasts. This difference was somewhat similar to Zhou Wen’s Truth Listener. It made Zhou Wen suspect that it might have come from Small Buddha Temple.

Back when the three-faced Buddha gave three Companion Eggs, Zhou Wen chose Truth Listener. He wasn’t very sure what the remaining two Companion Eggs were.

“You are quite a discerning person. That’s right. The Anasrava Gold Turtle is indeed not a Companion Beast from the North District. However, in this era, Companion Beasts no longer have any limitations. It doesn’t matter where it came from. What’s important is that it’s in my hands,” said Pata.

“If I were to guess, would you tell me where this Anasrava Gold Turtle came from?” Zhou Wen said to Pata.

“What do you mean?” Pata frowned.

“If I’m not wrong, this Anasrava Gold Turtle should be from Luoyang.” When Zhou Wen mentioned Luoyang, Pata’s eyes flickered, making him even more convinced of his judgment.

“It’s not a question of where it comes from. What exactly…” Before Pata could finish his sentence, Zhou Wen interrupted him.

“Of course it’s a problem. Luoyang belongs to the An family. Since your Companion Beast came from Luoyang, it should belong to the An family to begin with. How can you use it to make a deal with me?” Zhou Wen said slowly.

“Zhou Wen, cut the crap. Why don’t you say that all the Companion Beasts in the world belong to your family? Do you want to make a deal with me? Don’t force me to lend the Anasrava Gold Turtle to Karoman.” Pata was somewhat vexed.

Zhou Wen ignored Pata’s anger and took out his phone to call a number.

“Zhou Wen, why are you suddenly calling me?” Lance’s voice sounded over the phone.

“Let me ask you something,” Zhou Wen said.

“What’s the matter?” Lance found it odd. Zhou Wen and the An family were basically active in the East District and seldom went to the North District. He didn’t know what Zhou Wen was up to.

“Pata is from your Ultimate Family Clan, right?” Zhou Wen asked.

Lance paused and didn’t answer directly. Instead, he asked, “Why are you suddenly asking this?”

By the side, Pata sneered and said, “Zhou Wen, it’s useless even if you try to pull strings. Lance’s reputation doesn’t matter to me. A third of the profits-not one cent less. It’s useless no matter who you get.”

Pata imagined that Zhou Wen was trying to get Lance to negotiate on his behalf, so he spoke without any mercy.

“I’m just asking. Do I need to take you into consideration?” Zhou Wen ignored Pata and said to Lance.

“There’s no need to consider me. As long as you don’t beat him to death, it’s fine.” Lance answered immediately without asking any questions.

Zhou Wen immediately knew that Lance and Pata didn’t have a good relationship. It was even possible that this fellow didn’t have many good social connections in the Ultimate Family Clan.

If Pata had some social connections in the Ultimate Family Clan, it would be impossible for Lance to say such things.

“Got it.” Having made a decision, Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else and hung up.

Pata looked at Zhou Wen and said coldly, “Zhou Wen, I advise you to think it through carefully. Since I dare come here, I’m not afraid that you will attack me. Don’t force me to side with Karoman. You can’t bear the consequences, much less Guide Ancient City.”

“I’ve thought it through very clearly. Since I don’t need to consider Lance, it’s time for you to return what’s not yours.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he had secretly switched to the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art.

Not long ago, Zhou Wen had entered a hidden dungeon in the endless cosmos. Furthermore, he had advanced the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art to the Calamity grade. Now, he could test it out with Pata.
