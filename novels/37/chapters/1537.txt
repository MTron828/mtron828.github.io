Chapter 1538: Fire-Armored God

Translator: CKtalon

As the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s lighting range was limited, and the things below were too large, the area he could see was only a portion of it. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Just like blind people touching an elephant, based on what he saw, Zhou Wen was unable to determine what it was.

What he could see was an uneven stone platform. It was pockmarked as though it had been bombed by a bomber.

Zhou Wen was just about to land and get closer to the stone and see where he was when he realized that the stone platform below had moved before he did.

The stone platform was slowly spinning. Clearly, it wasn’t land. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have spun.

As the stone spun, Zhou Wen gradually saw some signs of artificial carving. He realized that it looked like a huge statue.

However, the parts he could see were limited. He didn’t know what the carving was.

When most of the stone spun to the other side, Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that it was a statue of a Buddha.

Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with the Buddha statue. It was the biggest Buddha statue in Dragon Gate Grotto. Zhou Wen had often been to Dragon Gate Grotto, so he was naturally familiar with it.

However, half of the Buddha statue’s body had blasted away.

Clearly, the Buddha statue was floating in the void.

How did this happen? Why did this Buddha statue become like this? Who shattered half of it? Is Dragon Gate Grotto still around?

?Zhou Wen was alarmed. If this was the future of the world, wouldn’t it mean that Luoyang was doomed?

Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the phone screen suddenly turned black. Zhou Wen imagined that the Human Sovereign Sutra had failed. After checking, he realized that the blood-colored avatar had died. He didn’t even know how it had died. Zhou Wen could only smile bitterly to himself.

Past, Present, Future, Chaos, First Order of Chaos… Will there be a connection between these??As Zhou Wen thought about it, his eyes suddenly lit up.

Right, the First Order of Chaos is Chaos’s Essence Energy Art. Chaos’s status in that Mythical system is probably similar to the egg that trapped Pangu. If I treat it as Chaos, then Chaos has no concept of time and space. There shouldn’t be a past, present, or future…?Zhou Wen kept thinking.

…

While Zhou Wen was in Regretless City, Earth wasn’t very calm.

Some creatures appeared on the Cube again. No matter how one looked at them, these creatures looked like Earth’s dinosaurs. Some looked like tyrannosaurus rexes and some looked like triceratops or pterosaurs.

These creatures wanted to enter the Dubhe dimensional zone, but without exception, they were killed by the amethyst-armored creature. Even though they knew that the difference in strength was huge, some creatures still rushed in from time to time.

Although none of these creatures suspected to be dinosaurs cleared the level, their appearance and strength became a hot topic.

“Do you think those dinosaur-like fellows came from Earth?”

“I heard that the dinosaurs’ extinction is very bizarre. Don’t tell me they chose to leave Earth and develop in the universe?”

“That’s really hard to say. Anyway, I find it strange why the dinosaurs went completely extinct. Not even one survived. From the perspective of probabilities, it doesn’t make sense.”

“If those dinosaurs really came from Earth, aren’t they a little too strong?”

“Dinosaurs have extremely powerful bodies to begin with…”

Whether or not dinosaur-like creatures had left Earth, the various media outlets expressed their views. The ordinary citizens also had their own views.

However, no matter what kind of dinosaur it was, they ultimately died in the dungeon. There were no exceptions.

As people discussed, the Cube’s screen lit up again. Other creatures were challenging the Dubhe dimensional zone.

The challengers were surprisingly not dinosaurs.

They were creatures suspected to be human. Their entire bodies were covered in armor, preventing anyone from seeing what was inside.

The black armor looked like it was made of raw metal, but there was nothing special about it.

Just like the tyrannosaurus from before, the armor-clad creatures arrived outside Dubhe’s palace. They pushed open the door and walked over.

Boom!

The amethyst-armored creature in the palace erupted with the purple flames that Zhou Wen was more familiar with.

Unlike the dinosaurs, the creatures that came this time weren’t instantly killed. Amidst the terrifying purple blast, they walked towards the amethyst-armored creature.

People quickly realized that the challengers weren’t here to kill the amethyst-armored creature, but to circle around it and reach the back of the palace.

There was a teleportation nexus there. The creatures stood on the teleportation nexus before disappearing. The Cube’s screen switched to the ranking interface. A name appeared in first place.

“Fire-Armored God.” Zhang Chunqiu softly repeated the word as he frowned, as though he was thinking about something difficult.

After this battle, people realized that if they wanted to pass through the palace and reach the teleportation nexus, they could do so without killing the amethyst-armored creature inside.

Even so, no one dared to give it a try. The light blast produced by the amethyst-armored creature was just too powerful. It wasn’t that simple to bypass it.

Zhou Wen was studying how to kill the amethyst-armored creature and wasn’t in the mood to look at the Cube. Therefore, he didn’t know that clearing the level didn’t require killing the amethyst-armored creature.

After Fire-Armored God entered the rankings, the various families began a new round of tests. It was impossible for humans to kill the amethyst creature, but it didn’t seem impossible as long as they made a run for it.

Everyone was searching for a way to withstand the light blast. The price of light and fire-elemental defensive Companion Beasts increased several times overnight. However, it was limited to high-level Companion Beasts. Low-level ones were useless.

Some powerful factions began deliberately heading to fire-elemental dimensional zones to hunt dimensional creatures. Some people also thought of Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, but when they arrived, they realized that it had vanished.

While others were desperately searching for fire-elemental Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen’s body was undergoing a strange change.

At that moment, Zhou Wen was standing in front of Sweetie’s hut. He hadn’t entered it. The First Order of Chaos circulated in his body, and his hand was pressing down on the wooden tablet with the words “Sweetie’s Hut.”

As the First Order of Chaos circulated, the words on the wooden tablet slowly vanished as though they had been sucked away by some force.

While Zhou Wen studied the First Order of Chaos, he realized that the power of the Time Hut didn’t come from the hut itself, but from these words.
