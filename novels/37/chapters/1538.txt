Chapter 1539: Heaven-Opening Words

Translator: CKtalon

What are these words? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Zhou Wen had been considering this question the entire time. All this time, he had been observing the Time Hut, but nothing in the hut was abnormal enough to cause a reaction from the First Order of Chaos. Only the words on the hut were somewhat special.

Sweetie’s Hut, Past, Present, Future, and Chaos—why do these words have a special power? What is the foundation of this power? Why is this power related to the First Order of Chaos?

In the beginning, there was only Chaos, and it drew the curtains to all things. What is the First Order?

While pondering over this problem, Zhou Wen checked some explanations regarding the words on the Internet. Typical resources stipulated that text were symbols.

This explanation was naturally correct, but when one thought about it deeper, words were actually a set of coordinates. A single text represented a set of coordinates. Two words were like the latitude and longitude of Earth, so it could more accurately define a set of coordinates.

Three words might be the length, breadth, and height of a three-dimensional world. They gave a more precise positioning.

The more words there were, the more precise the coordinates would be. The spatial dimensions they represented might also be higher.

Words were very magical. Originally, no one knew what the things in this world were. Everything was chaotic and unknown. Only with text could people come to a common agreement on what something was.

The use of words was to give all things—things that could and couldn’t be seen—a coordinate defined by humans. As long as one said the coordinates, anyone who knew the word would know what it was.

This was equivalent to giving the chaotic world order. The world itself didn’t need order because existence was order in itself. Humans needed order. Humans were the ones who discovered order, and words were the best carrier for human-established order.

When Zhou Wen comprehended this and touched the engraved wooden plaques, the First Order of Chaos automatically circulated.

The words on the wooden tablet transformed into a strange force that flowed into his body and fused with the First Order of Chaos, causing it to undergo a shocking transformation.

After Zhou Wen absorbed the words—Past, Present, and Future—he vaguely felt that the First Order of Chaos had reached the edge of Calamity transformation, but it was still lacking that final step.

Therefore, Zhou Wen went to the door and attempted to absorb the words “Sweetie’s Hut.” However, the words also had magical powers.

It left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled. The power of the words “past, present, and future” clearly had traces of time and space. However, the power transmitted by Sweetie’s Hut didn’t seem to have much to do with time and space.

Just as Zhou Wen was wondering what was going on, the Chaos Egg appeared and enveloped the blood-colored avatar’s body.

Zhou Wen and the blood-colored avatar were one. Everything the blood-colored avatar felt was happening to Zhou Wen himself. At that moment, he could clearly sense that the blood-colored avatar’s body was undergoing a strange change.

The Chaos Egg in the past was a form of protection for Zhou Wen. It was a breeding ground for nutrition.

However, as the blood-colored avatar’s body changed, Zhou Wen felt that the Chaos Egg had become an obstacle. Or rather, a shackle that bound his body, making him feel abnormally uncomfortable.

It was like a person being locked in a cramped closet for an entire night. He needed to curl up his entire body into a ball and have his knees pressed against his chest to squeeze in.

After a night of torture, what this person wanted the most was to leave.

Zhou Wen felt the same way. Now, he had the urge to break through the Chaos Egg and rush out to take a breath of fresh air. He felt extremely uncomfortable.

Pangu split the heavens and earth apart to allow all things to live. Could it be that this Chaos Egg can only form the Calamity Zone through its destruction?

?The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right.

Therefore, he gathered his strength, hoping to break through the Chaos Egg’s restraints.

However, only now did Zhou Wen clearly realize how terrifying the Chaos Egg’s defense was.

His physical strength and Essence Energy were already comparable to a Human Realm creature, but when such power struck the Chaos Egg, it hardly left a scuff, much less break it.

Zhou Wen unleashed his Essence Energy again and again to strike the Chaos Egg, but he failed to shatter it.

Why are you so tenacious? Aren’t you giving me trouble??Zhou Wen didn’t seem to realize that if it wasn’t for the Chaos Egg’s powerful defense, he would have been dead several times over.

However, the advantage of the Chaos Egg now became his greatest obstacle. Zhou Wen had liked the Chaos Egg’s defense in the past, but now, it was tormenting.

He kept at it, be it ten times, hundred times, a thousand times, or even ten thousand times, but despite Zhou Wen not giving up, the Chaos Egg had no intention of shattering.

Ignoring the shattering of the Chaos Egg, he couldn’t even scrape the Chaos Egg’s membrane.

Zhou Wen knew very well that persistence was very important, but sometimes, persistence needed brains.

How can I break the Chaos Egg? I’m not the real Pangu. Even if I were Pangu, I don’t have that ax that split the heavens and earth apart. Wait… Where did Pangu’s ax come from? Nothing had been born amidst the Chaos, so there shouldn’t be the concept of an ax. The so-called Pangu Ax might not be an ax. Perhaps myths and legends have objectified some kind of power. Then, what’s the power that can split the heavens and earth??Zhou Wen thought about it. He wasn’t willing to aimlessly do something futile.

Since words are a carrier of human order, when words give the originally unknown world a definition, it’s equivalent to splitting apart the heavens and earth…?The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more convinced he was.

Zhou Wen wasn’t wrong. The fault was that he was from the East District. The culture he was familiar with was a little different from the West District’s Chaos mythology.

It couldn’t be said to be wrong. It was just that his understanding was somewhat different, so the direction he took was somewhat different.

The Chaos Egg should have advanced to the Calamity grade in another way, but Zhou Wen had taken a completely different path. The West District’s Essence Energy Art had been imbued with the culture and spirit of the East District. Even the founder of the First Order of Chaos probably never expected the First Order of Chaos to be comprehended in such a manner.

Above the Chaos Egg, shimmering words gradually appeared. Stroke by stroke, shimmering words—mountains, rivers, wind, fire, sun, moon, and stars—appeared, and a portion of the Chaos Egg disintegrated and melted.

The words vanished with the Chaos Egg.

When the final Chaos Egg shard melted, the blood-colored avatar’s body was liberated. In the next second, the blood-colored avatar’s body lit up as countless words spewed out from his body like a data stream.. They spun around his body like blocks, forming the appearance of a Chaos Egg that enveloped Zhou Wen’s body.
