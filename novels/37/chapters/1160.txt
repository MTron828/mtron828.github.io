Chapter 1161: Female Sword Immortal

ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Qin Mu’s face darkened. He didn’t dare take Zhou Wen to his sister. Furthermore, he never expected him to really dare visit his sister.

Ignoring the fact that his girlfriend was here, just the fame of his sister as Female Sword Immortal was enough to scare away many suitors. Ordinary men didn’t have the courage to stand in front of his sister.

However, Qin Mu thought about it again. He had seen many outstanding men, but when they really stood in front of his sister, all of them quickly lost their confidence. They would become at a loss for words because Qin Zhen’s aura was too strong.

Even if he really took Zhou Wen to see Qin Zhen, Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t dare say anything rash in front of her. Perhaps he could bluff his way through.

“Senior, do you really want to meet my sister?” Qin Mu asked Zhou Wen.

“Didn’t we agree on this?” Zhou Wen said.

“Alright, I, Qin Mu, admit defeat. I’ll take you there now. Follow me if you have the guts.” After Qin Mu said that, he walked out of the training grounds.

Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi and saw that she didn’t have any special reaction. Only then did he pick up Ya’er and follow. Tsukuyomi followed behind.

As for many students who had enjoyed the battle, they followed behind as though they wanted to see if Zhou Wen would really date Female Sword Immortal. She was the goddess that many boys in school had a crush on.

Qin Mu walked in front for a while and saw that Zhou Wen had really followed him. Furthermore, he had brought two beauties—one young, one old—with him. He couldn’t help but ask in surprise, “Don’t tell me you plan on taking them to see my sister?”

“Can’t I?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Sure, of course. As you wish.” Qin Mu thought to himself, Is this fellow stupid? It would be strange if he doesn’t get beaten up when he takes this woman to see my sister. However, this is also good. When that happens, my sister won’t be in the mood to care about me.

Qin Zhen was a tutor at Sunset College. She lived there, so they didn’t need to leave the campus.

Luoyang had a very high status in the Federation, and Sunset College had long been famous throughout the Federation.

Ignoring the fact that the Federation President had once studied at Sunset College, just Luoyang’s present strength was enough to match the six families.

However, these powerful figures didn’t completely belong to the An family. Otherwise, the An family might have become the seventh family clan.

Qin Mu quickly led Zhou Wen and company to Qin Zhen’s residence. This place surprised Zhou Wen.

“Four Seasons Garden. Your sister lives here?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the building in front of him.

This was the Four Seasons Garden that had previously been reserved for special admissions students. Furthermore, the building that Qin Zhen lived in was the same one that he used to live in.

Although many small buildings in Four Seasons Garden had been rebuilt, the three buildings in the last row didn’t seem to have changed much. They were about the same as before.

“That’s right. Are you going in?” Qin Mu asked Zhou Wen with a grin.

He was very relaxed now. Zhou Wen was holding the hand of a girl who was about seven or eight years old. Behind him was a beauty who looked to be in her twenties. All he needed to do was tell Qin Zhen that this man wanted to woo her. With Qin Zhen’s temper, the outcome was obvious.

“Why not?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Alright, wait a moment. I’ll take you to see my sister now.” Qin Mu pushed open the door and walked in. When he arrived in front of the building, he pressed the doorbell.

“Sis, are you there?” Qin Mu shouted at the video doorbell.

“What are you doing here?” A cold woman’s voice sounded from inside. She didn’t sound old, but her attitude was very cold.

“There’s a senior who wants to get to know you. I brought him over to meet you,” Qin Mu said as he turned his body to the side, allowing Qin Zhen to see Zhou Wen standing behind him through the video.

“By the way, Senior, what’s your name?” Only then did Qin Mu realize that he didn’t even know Zhou Wen’s name.

Zhou Wen ignored him and looked at the door. He didn’t use Truth Listener to scan the situation inside. After all, she was a woman and not an enemy. It would be impolite.

Seeing that Zhou Wen didn’t answer, Qin Mu asked again.

Before Zhou Wen could answer, the door to the building opened. A young woman in her twenties walked out.

She wore the combat uniform produced by the An family, accentuating her perfect figure. Although she wasn’t too tall, her figure was very well-proportioned.

Zhou Wen immediately found the woman’s face familiar. After some thought, he immediately recalled and knew where she had learned Transcendent Flying Immortal.

I never expected that the silent and introverted junior from back then would have already become a famous Female Sword Immortal in the Federation, Zhou Wen thought wistfully.

Back then, he noticed that a female junior had quite a bit of talent in the way of the sword, so he had casually given her some scattered notes he had already memorized while practicing Transcendent Flying Immortal.

Zhou Wen didn’t take this matter to heart at all. He had long forgotten about it. Furthermore, he never expected that the junior would use the scattered notes in the notebook to cultivate Transcendent Flying Immortal to such an extent. She had even become a famous Female Sword Immortal.

If it wasn’t for Zhou Wen’s good memory, he would have found it unbelievable that Qin Zhen was the junior from back then.

When Qin Mu saw Qin Zhen walk out, he thought that Qin Zhen wanted to chase Zhou Wen away. Therefore, he fanned the flames and said, “Sis, let me introduce you. This senior wants to date you. And this person is his fiancée... I don’t know what relationship this little girl has with them. Senior, could this be your daughter...”

Qin Mu was secretly delighted. He felt that Qin Zhen would definitely teach this reckless senior a lesson.

Just as he expected, Qin Zhen walked towards Zhou Wen like a gust of wind.

Qin Mu was already beginning to worry for Zhou Wen. If Qin Zhen was too heavy-handed and crippled him, it would be difficult to explain things to the college.

As he was thinking, Qin Zhen stood in front of Zhou Wen. Just as Qin Mu thought that Qin Zhen’s terrifying attack was coming, he saw Qin Zhen stop in front of Zhou Wen. She didn’t draw her sword or attack.

What was even more unbelievable was that Qin Zhen’s face revealed an expression that Qin Mu had never seen before.

It was difficult to describe her expression. It was as though she was pleasantly surprised, but at the same time, she seemed to be at a loss. The present Qin Zhen had no indication of the female sword immortal’s killing intent and arrogance at all. She was like a girl-next-door who was secretly in love with an older boy.

“Heavens... Is there something wrong with my eyes? That’s definitely not my dream goddess, Female Sword Immortal Qin Zhen, right? How can she have such an expression?” The male students who had come to watch the commotion were dumbfounded when they saw Qin Zhen’s expression.

Qin Mu was shocked beyond words. As a younger brother, he had never seen Qin Zhen like this.

“Senior.” Qin Zhen bowed her head and called out bashfully, as though she had become that introverted and shy junior from back then.

“God, smite me with lightning. I don’t want to live anymore. Tell me that it’s not Sword Immortal Qin Zhen. It’s definitely not...” Many boys wanted to kill Zhou Wen. How could a goddess show such an expression to another man? It was absolutely unforgivable.
