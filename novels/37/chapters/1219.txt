Chapter 1220: Venusian Dungeon

Translator: CKtalon

In a chamber, there was only Zhou Wen and Hui Haifeng.

“Where have you been for the past five years?” Hui Haifeng asked Zhou Wen.

“How did you know that I wasn’t the one at Chess Mountain?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise. For Hui Haifeng to accurately say five years was clearly not a wild guess.

Hui Haifeng rolled his eyes. “Do you think I don’t know your character? Just a glance at a photo was sufficient for me to tell that it wasn’t you.”

“Alright,” Zhou Wen said helplessly. “I was trapped by Teacher. It was no different from being dead. I only came out after five years.”

Hui Haifeng nodded. “I roughly guessed it. You are Human Sovereign, right? The dimension wouldn’t let your killing of Di Tian rest. If you hadn’t died, the past five years wouldn’t have been so peaceful. However, with Teacher’s personality, he probably wouldn’t just let you die for five years. There must be some scheme, right?”

“Sort of. Time passed very slowly in the place where I was trapped. It felt like more than a hundred years had passed,” Zhou Wen said

Hui Haifeng said jealously, “Teacher really dotes on you the most. Five years for a hundred years. If I had so much time, I might have even developed a Calamity-grade dimensional serum.”

“It’s only time for the mind. Your body can’t even move. What can you research?” Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless.

“That’s true.” Hui Haifeng chuckled.

“In just five years, you became the Federation President. Impressive,” Zhou Wen said.

“It’s considered a multifaceted coincidence. On the one hand, it’s because of my research. Also, didn’t Teacher give us some things before he went to the dimension? Those things were very helpful to me.” Hui Haifeng paused for a moment before continuing, “However, as the president, it’s all in name with no actual power. In fact, most of the Federation’s power is in the hands of the League of Guardians and the six families. As the president, I can’t even completely control Holy City.”

“Then why are you still the president?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

“Why not? Although I’m only a figurehead, I’m already in this position. I can slowly change some things and think of ways to realize my dreams. Just like an actor, only by appearing on stage can you let others see your acting skills and infect others with your emotions. If I were to only stand offstage, no matter how good my acting skills were or how much I fantasized, I wouldn’t be able to affect anyone,” Hui Haifeng said.

“What do you want?” Zhou Wen looked at Hui Haifeng.

“I want to make sure that there are no more orphans in this world,” Hui Haifeng said seriously. “You might find it ridiculous, and I know that this is almost an impossible goal, but I just want to give it a try.”

“It’s not funny at all.” Zhou Wen was somewhat moved. Although he didn’t have such lofty goals, it didn’t stop him from admiring such a person.

“Of course, I also want to see what it’s like to stand at the peak of the world,” Hui Haifeng chuckled and continued.

Hui Haifeng’s change in attitude left Zhou Wen at a loss whether to laugh or cry. “Now that you’ve almost done it, how does it feel to be president?”

“Not good at all. There’s many things I wish to do but can’t.” Hui Haifeng shook his head, clearly not wanting to say too much.

Zhou Wen didn’t ask further. This wasn’t his specialty. He couldn’t help Hui Haifeng with anything, so asking was useless.

“What’s going on between you and Gu Dian?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Some fellows don’t wish for me to get too close to Gu Dian, or rather, they don’t wish for me to get too close to the underground market, so this happened,” Hui Haifeng said vaguely, but Zhou Wen still understood.

The two of them chatted about some matters, but they didn’t chat for long. Hui Haifeng was just too busy. Soon, he had to leave to handle some matters.

Hui Haifeng got Zhou Wen to stay and wait for him to come back for dinner.

Zhou Wen returned to the temporary room Hui Haifeng had arranged for him. He took out his phone and realized that he had successfully downloaded the Venusian instance dungeon. It took much less time than he had imagined.

After tapping open the Venusian instance dungeon, the blood-colored avatar quickly appeared on the top platform of the hemispherical metal building. It was likely the entrance to the metal building, but it didn’t open.

Zhou Wen knew that such an entrance that couldn’t be opened needed a special method to enter. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Using Human Sovereign’s power, he attempted to forcefully break through the entrance, but he failed. The metal building was unimaginably hard. Even a Terror-grade power couldn’t damage it.

He tried using Truth Listener and Eyes of Penetration, but he failed to see what was happening inside the metal building.

After carving out Clown Mask, Zhou Wen used teleportation to enter. He succeeded. The scene in front of him changed as the blood-colored avatar found itself inside the hemispherical metal building.

However, the scene he saw left him slightly taken aback.

Beneath the entrance was a hexagonal room. In the middle of the room stood a metal statue that was four to five meters tall.

The metal statue was bright silver in color and looked very strange. It was like a huge human wearing modern metal armor. However, he was certain that there was no human inside. It was a pure metal statue.

In his left hand, he was actually holding a weapon. No matter how he looked at it, the weapon looked like a submachine gun but it looked more technologically advanced. The body of the gun was also bright silver metal.

Just as Zhou Wen was planning what to do with the strange metal statue, its eyes suddenly lit up with a golden glow.

Click! Click!

Following that, Zhou Wen saw the spear in the metal statue’s hand spew fire at the blood-colored avatar. Large amounts of metal bullets spewed out at an unbelievable speed.

Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar and teleported to the back of the metal statue. He slashed down with the Asura Saber in his hand, splitting the metal statue into two.

‘Killed Mythical creature, Metal Guard. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’

A Strength Crystal dropped. Before Zhou Wen could pick it up, a door appeared on each of the six walls of the hexagonal room. A large number of Metal Guards rushed in with guns in hand.

At the same time, a large number of bullets shot from all directions. Their firepower covered the entire room, leaving almost no room for dodging.

Zhou Wen was an expert who could teleport after all. However, he didn’t choose to teleport. He underwent Terror transformation and allowed the bullets to hit him. They passed through his body as though his body was an illusion. The bullets couldn’t injure him at all.

The bullets hit the wall and many of them hit the Metal Guards, but they quickly melted into the walls or the Metal Guards. They didn’t harm themselves.

If one isn’t at the Terror grade, a Mythical human would probably have been killed instantly. This is just the beginning. This dungeon is interesting.. Zhou Wen now wanted to know what was deep inside the dungeon.
