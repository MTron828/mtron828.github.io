Chapter 1835: Son of the Holy Spirit

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen removed his mask and revealed his true appearance.

“Human Sovereign!” The people surrounding Zhou Wen and company immediately recognized him and were stunned.

“Everyone, please make way.” With that said, Zhou Wen walked forward with the golden box.

The believers automatically gave way and no one stopped them.

“Zhou Wen isn’t a believer of God. How can we let him take the Ark of the Covenant away?” Fred still wanted to put up a last stand.

However, no one bothered with him. The believers looked at Fred as though he was a fool.

“So it’s Human Sovereign. Then it’s fine.”

“It’s no wonder you can obtain such grace. As expected of the sovereign of humanity. It’s only right.”

“Lord Human Sovereign having the Ark is most appropriate. Only Lord Human Sovereign can represent our human race. The Holy Father must have thought so too. That’s why He bestowed such a gift…”

Zhou Wen carried the golden box and left Heaven with Wang Lu and company. Fred’s face turned livid with anger.

Zhou Wen ignored Fred. Now that humans had suffered heavy losses, he couldn’t be bothered to start a massacre because of one person.

With the Cape family around, the West District could maintain its stability for a period of time. If the Cape family collapsed now, the West District would definitely be in chaos. When that happened, more people would die.

If not for his disinclination to see the West District in chaos, Zhou Wen would have long wiped out the Cape family. It wouldn’t be too late to settle scores with them in the future.

Without taking the Ship of Salvation back, Zhou Wen used spatial teleportation to send Wang Lu and company back to Guide Ancient City.

“Coach, is this really the legendary Ark of the Covenant?” Ming Xiu circled the golden box a few times and asked in puzzlement.

He didn’t discover anything special about the golden box. It looked no different from an ordinary one.

“Who knows?” Zhou Wen didn’t know what it was either. Even if it was really the Ark of the Covenant, it was only a cabinet used to store contracts. It was unlikely to be important.

If it wasn’t for the special material of the cabinet, he wouldn’t have brought it back.

“Zhou Wen, what do you plan on doing with this box?” Wang Lu asked.

“Nothing. I only brought it back because of its special material. This isn’t ordinary gold. Even Calamity-grade powers can’t damage it at all,” Zhou Wen said.

“If you don’t have any plans, can you leave it to me?” Wang Lu asked after some thought.

“Sure. Take it if you need it,” Zhou Wen said.

“I have a Companion Beast that has the art of forging. I can use this box to forge tools for you. What do you want? Some weapon or armor?” Wang Lu explained.

“Armor.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that he didn’t lack weapons. Furthermore, the golden box’s material was so special that even the Vajra Chakram couldn’t smash it open in one strike. If it was used as armor, it might be able to withstand an Apocalypse-grade attack.

“Alright, leave it to me.” Wang Lu got someone to take the golden box back.

Zhou Wen returned to his room and began studying his gains received from Heaven.

51 forbidden fruits, a crystal-like Companion Egg, and a blood-stained rag.

Zhou Wen temporarily couldn’t figure out the use for the rag, nor did he eat the forbidden fruit willy-nilly. All he could do was hatch the Companion Egg.

As Essence Energy was injected, the holy light in the Companion Egg intensified. When the glow reached its peak, it emitted a light blast that resembled a cosmic Big Bang.

When the light gradually dissipated, a beautiful angel appeared in front of him.

The angel was dressed in white and looked holy and elegant. She looked like an ordinary two-winged angel, but she had six pairs of crystal-like wings on her back.

As Zhou Wen was still sizing up the angel Companion Beast, she flashed gently and appeared behind him as though she had instant transmitted. Her hands hugged Zhou Wen’s body from behind as her six pairs of crystal wings enveloped him, protecting his body. She transformed into crystalline holy light that fused into Zhou Wen’s back.

After the angel vanished, a twelve-winged seraphim tattoo appeared on his back.

Sweetie sure is interesting!?After seeing the stats of Child of the Holy Spirit, Zhou Wen could only say that the Companion Beast was perfect.

Her entire body was immune to all sorts of taboo powers. She also had the ability to revive. As for Omniscient & Omnipotent, it could mimic any skill of the opponent.

Of course, this was under a premise. The Child of the Holy Spirit had to be struck by those skills before she could simulate them.

Furthermore, it could only be used once. It wasn’t permanent.

Although there were some restrictions, it was already good enough.

There was no need to mention the Companion Beast’s Soul form. It was one of the most practical Companion Beast forms.

999 stats was already the limit of a Calamity Companion Beast. Zhou Wen didn’t have many of them.

After summoning her and admiring her for a while, Zhou Wen unsummoned the Child of the Holy Spirit and took out another forbidden fruit.

He didn’t dare eat it. Even if he ate it, it was impossible for him to die. However, Zhou Wen couldn’t accept it if he grew those ugly scales.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that Demonic Neonate wouldn’t eat it. After all, she refused to eat the Ginseng Fruit. It was impossible for the effects of the forbidden fruit to surpass the Ginseng Fruit.

He took out a forbidden fruit and summoned Explosive Fiend Man. Just as he was about to experiment on him, Demonic Neonate came out herself and took the forbidden fruit from Zhou Wen’s hand. She swallowed it in two or three mouthfuls.

“You eat this?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. Seeing that Demonic Neonate hadn’t changed after eating the forbidden fruit, he decided to give all the forbidden fruits to Demonic Neonate.

Demonic Neonate didn’t stand on ceremony as she stuffed the forbidden fruits into her mouth one by one. Soon, only one of the forbidden fruits was left.

Demonic Neonate licked her lips, but she didn’t eat the remaining forbidden fruit. Instead, she pointed at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen didn’t understand what she meant. He imagined that Demonic Neonate wanted him to eat the remaining forbidden fruit.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to pick up the forbidden fruit, Demonic Neonate tugged at his sleeve to stop him from eating it. Then, she pointed at Zhou Wen’s back.

Zhou Wen immediately understood that Demonic Neonate wasn’t referring to him, but the Child of the Holy Spirit tattoo on his back.

Zhou Wen summoned the Child of the Holy Spirit again and pointed at her. “You want her to eat it?”

Demonic Neonate nodded, indicating that Zhou Wen finally got it right.

Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to ask further. Since Demonic Neonate indicated for him to feed it to her, he would feed it to her. Therefore, he gave the forbidden fruit to the Child of the Holy Spirit and let her eat it.
