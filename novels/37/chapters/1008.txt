Chapter 1009: Sunday Dungeon

Translator: CKtalon

“Choose between one: a friend or a top Mythical Companion Egg. The other will be destroyed. What will your choice be?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback when he saw this question.

The definition of friends had a very wide range. Even very good friends would sometimes choose to sacrifice their friends when faced with enough benefits. Human nature often failed to withstand tests.

“Zhou Wen, step back. It’s very difficult to have the correct answer to this question,” Lance immediately said.

If Zhou Wen was a little tempted by a top Mythical Companion Egg, his choice of friend would result in his death. Also, choosing a top Mythical Companion Egg would make others think that Zhou Wen didn’t value friends.

Of course, the choice was the other way around, but this didn’t hinder one’s comprehension.

“That’s right. There are many types of friends. How can we generalize them? This question is a huge trap. Don’t answer it. Let’s try again tomorrow,” Gulli said.

“It’s fine. There’s no need to wait for tomorrow. It’s a waste of time.” Zhou Wen secretly activated the Heaven-Opening Scripture and chose top Mythical Companion Egg. Under normal logic, it meant Zhou Wen had chosen ‘friend.’

Lance and company didn’t know that Zhou Wen had the ability to restrain all sorts of taboo powers. When they saw that Zhou Wen had chosen ‘friend,’ they broke out into a cold sweat for him. He might die if there was any screw up.

However, Zhou Wen walked into the Maze of Lies unscathed and didn’t die.

The silencer on the side said in surprise, “He’s actually willing to give up a top Mythical Companion Egg without any hesitation. Such a person is already rare.”

“With Coach’s strength, a top Mythical Companion Egg is nothing to him. It’s normal for him to choose a friend,” Gulli said.

However, Feng Qiuyan said, “Even if Coach didn’t have a Mythical Companion Egg to choose from, I believe he would choose a friend.”

“Regardless, I believe Zhou Wen is a rare friend,” Lance said.

Li Xuan knew Zhou Wen well, but he didn’t say a word.

Zhou Wen actually wasn’t sure how he would choose. After all, it depended on the situation. He didn’t dare confirm that he would choose a friend, so for safety’s sake, he used the Heaven-Opening Scripture.

Next, it was Feng Qiuyan’s turn. Feng Qiuyan’s question wasn’t difficult, so he easily gained entry.

The silencer and Lance joined in. Their questions didn’t have huge traps. All they needed to do was answer accordingly by lying.

After entering the maze, the silencer cast a silencing spell on Zhou Wen and company, preventing them from speaking as a way to stop them from saying anything wrong. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

As it was only Thursday, although there were many types of dimensional creatures inside, they didn’t discover any Mythical creatures. The few of them didn’t take long to clean up the maze.

With Lance and the silencer who were familiar with the area, it wasn’t a problem.

After leaving the maze, Lance said to Zhou Wen, “We can continue coming here to familiarize ourselves with the situation on Friday and Saturday. However, don’t enter on Sunday for the time being. All of us will enter when we’re ready.”

“I’ll just take a look myself. There’s no need for you to specially accompany me. You can busy yourself with your matters.” Zhou Wen actually didn’t wish to enter in reality. He only wanted to quickly download the Sunday dungeon and enter the Sunday dungeon in-game to figure out the situation inside.

Lance naturally trusted Zhou Wen’s strength, so he didn’t insist on accompanying him.

Zhou Wen went there on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday alone, but he only looked at the question on the door before returning without answering.

When others asked, he only said that he wasn’t confident about the question on the door, so he didn’t enter.

He finally downloaded the Sunday dungeon. After returning, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to launch it. He wanted to see what was different about the Sunday dungeon.

After launching the game dungeon, the blood-colored avatar stood in front of the door and he found it a little different from before. The door to the maze that looked like a clown’s face had already turned into skull-like material. The skeleton clown’s face was still emitting black smoke as blood flowed from its eyes. It looked extremely ferocious and terrifying.

Zhou Wen directly used the Heaven-Opening Scripture to avoid the question on the door, saving him the trouble of wasting time.

When the door opened, the scene Zhou Wen saw was indeed different from the Maze of Lies he had previously seen.

Although the layout didn’t seem to have changed much, strange blood flames burned in the maze. The merry-go-round had turned into bones with blood flames burning on them.

Everywhere he looked was filled with bones and blood flames. It was like hell.

A Mischief Clown appeared on one of the horses. Its face looked even more sinister. Furthermore, its originally colorful body had turned black and white. Such purity made it look even stranger.

The three-colored balls also turned black and white. Each ball was half black and half white, completely different from what Zhou Wen had seen before.

When Mischief Clown saw the blood-colored avatar, it immediately flashed and vanished from the horse.

Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth to block him. As he didn’t know anything about this completely different looking Mischief Clown, Zhou Wen could only choose to first understand its abilities.

The vanished Mischief Clown appeared in front of Tyrant Behemoth like a ghost. It threw the magic ball in its hand at Tyrant Behemoth.

Tyrant Behemoth’s reaction was extremely fast as it struck the black-and-white magic ball.

However, the black-and-white magic ball vanished in front of Tyrant Behemoth’s fist. Zhou Wen immediately felt that something was amiss as he hurriedly controlled the blood-colored avatar to teleport away.

Indeed, the black-and-white magic ball seemed to pass through Tyrant Behemoth and appeared behind it before flying into the distance.

If Zhou Wen hadn’t dodged, the black-and-white magic ball would have hit him.

What ability is that? It’s completely different from ordinary Mischief Clowns. Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.

However, the Mischief Clown didn’t give him any time to be surprised. He threw out one black-and-white magic ball after another.

Unlike ordinary Mischief Clowns, it didn’t only have three black-and-white magic balls, but a total of six. Every black-and-white magic ball looked identical.

Even if the magic ball that it threw didn’t hit its target, it would bounce back after hitting something. The black-and-white magic ball that bounced back would become even faster.

The six magic balls quickly shot out from nearby. Every time Tyrant Behemoth wanted to strike the magic balls, the magic balls would vanish and appear in another spot.

The magic balls only targeted the blood-colored avatar. From the looks of it, not only did Sunday’s Mischief Clown’s abilities become terrifying, but even his intelligence seemed to have increased greatly. He actually knew the principle of capturing the leader.
