Chapter 1838: Bravest

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen roughly knew his location in the dimension, so there was nothing to be worried about.

More than half of the dimension had been taken down by Wang Mingyuan. Only a few dimensional races were still holding on.

Now that the dimensional races couldn’t even fend for themselves, how could they have the time to care about an outsider like him?

As long as he didn’t go knocking on the other party’s door, probably no Apocalypse-grade powerhouse would have the time to chase after him. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Why would the dimension invade Earth when it’s so vast? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

Just the Sand Sea alone was much bigger than the whole of Earth.

What was there for them to vie for in such a small place like Earth?

Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he suddenly saw the Sand Sea ahead of him ripple like water. Then, he saw a person jump out of the sea of sand like a fish jumping out of the water.

Her long black hair swayed, and her slender figure and proportions were almost like a character in a comic. Her long, slim legs didn’t seem realistic.

“Human, you actually dare barge into the dimension?” Bravest levitated in mid-air and looked down at Zhou Wen superciliously.

Before Zhou Wen could say a word, Bravest noticed Zhou Wen’s looks and immediately exclaimed, “Human Sovereign... You are Human Sovereign...”

“Am I that famous now?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised that a creature he had encountered in the dimension would know him.

“Human Sovereign, why did you come to the Sand Sea? Do you have any ulterior motives?” Bravest stared at Zhou Wen and asked warily.

“I’m just passing by. I don’t have any ulterior motives,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Don’t lie to me. Did Wang Mingyuan get you to come to the Sand Sea?” Bravest clearly didn’t believe Zhou Wen.

“I have nothing to do with Wang Mingyuan.” Zhou Wen shook his head.

“Tch, who doesn’t know that you are Wang Mingyuan’s disciple? Now that Wang Mingyuan wants to unify the dimension and fight the various races, the situation isn’t looking good.” Bravest said proudly, “He wants to rope in our Sand Sea race, but we haven’t come to an agreement. Does he want you to ambush our Sand Sea?”

Zhou Wen looked at Bravest with an odd expression.

He could sense that the girl’s aura was extremely powerful. She was undoubtedly at the Apocalypse grade.

However, such an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse actually said such unreliable words that sounded extremely childish.

This made Zhou Wen suspect that all dimensional creatures had low intelligence.

“How may I address you?” Zhou Wen asked with a light cough.

“What do you want?” The girl looked alarmed.

“I mean, I’m just a mere Calamity. With the six Apocalypse-grade creatures in the Sand Sea, how am I to sneak an attack on you?” Zhou Wen said helplessly. He felt that the creatures in the Sand Sea were strange.

Demon Shark and the girl were a little abnormal. It was unknown if they had sand for brains after all these years living in the sand.

“That makes sense.” Bravest thought for a moment and realized that it made sense. Hence, she nodded and said, “That’s true. You’re tempting fate if you want to ambush our Sand Sea alone. Then why did you come to the Sand Sea?”

“Didn’t I just say that I was just passing by?” Zhou Wen repeated helplessly.

“Where are you going?” Bravest asked curiously.

“Heavenly Happiness Temple.” Zhou Wen didn’t hide it.

“You are going to the Heavenly Happiness God?” Bravest immediately revealed a look of pleasant surprise when she heard that. “You also want to get a mate from Heavenly Happiness God?”

Zhou Wen found her words somewhat weird.

“No, I have something else to ask Heavenly Happiness God for help.”

Bravest’s eyes darted around as a smile appeared on her face. “You are a human. You are unfamiliar with the dimension that is fraught with danger. I’ll be kind and take you to the Heavenly Happiness Temple.”

No matter how he looked at it, Zhou Wen felt that she was the one who wanted to head to the Heavenly Happiness Temple herself, but her bristly expression made it seem like she was helping him.

“Thank you,” he said with a smile.

“It’s good that you know that I’m helping you. When we reach the Heavenly Happiness Temple, you have to help me.” Bravest’s eyes darted around.

“Of course. It’s only right to help each other.” Zhou Wen nodded in agreement.

“Then it’s a deal. Let’s set off now.” With that said, Bravest burrowed into the sea of sand and vanished in the blink of an eye.

She really has sand for brains... Zhou Wen looked at the desert in exasperation.

After a while, Bravest burrowed out again and asked Zhou Wen in puzzlement, “What’s wrong? Why aren’t you leaving?”

“I don’t have the ability to walk under the sand,” Zhou Wen explained patiently.

“How troublesome.” As Bravest spoke, she grabbed Zhou Wen’s hand and jumped into the Sand Sea.

Zhou Wen immediately felt the sand beneath his feet turn into water. Not only did it not hinder his body, but it also had a magical buoyancy.

The sand seemed to turn transparent. His vision could actually penetrate the sand, allowing him to see things in the distance.

Bravest pulled Zhou Wen through the Sand Sea where he saw all sorts of dilapidated ancient buildings at the bottom.

If he wasn’t sure that he was under the sand, he would have suspected that this was an ancient city that had been submerged by seawater.

Occasionally, he could see other creatures in the Sand Sea, but they swam far away upon noticing the girl. No one dared to approach.

The girl pulled Zhou Wen to a stop in front of an ancient building’s door and kicked the giant turtle-like creature in front of it. She kicked it to the side and pushed open the door to enter.

“It’s too troublesome bringing you along. Pass through the hourglass to obtain the ability to move freely in the Sand Sea,” Bravest said as she pointed at a huge transparent hourglass in the palace.

“Is this the Sand Sea’s treasure?” Zhou Wen sized up the hourglass with interest.

“Cut the crap. Hurry up.” The girl pushed Zhou Wen towards the hourglass.

Zhou Wen arrived above the hourglass. The upper half was transparent crystal, but when he stood on it, he felt his feet go limp as his body sank into the hourglass.

There was transparent sand in the hourglass. When Zhou Wen landed in the transparent sand, he immediately felt like he was soaking in water again.

The world spun as the hourglass automatically started flowing. The transparent sand in the upper half began to funnel down. Zhou Wen followed the sand vortex to the lower half of the hourglass.

When the transparent sand drowned his body, he felt a strange reaction.

Clang!

Zhou Wen fell out of the hourglass. At that moment, even without the girl holding him, the surrounding sand became like water to him.

“This treasure isn’t bad. Why is it here?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. Why wasn’t anyone taking such a treasure away?

“No one can take this away, so it can only be placed here,” said Bravest.

“It cannot be taken away?” Zhou Wen curiously went forward to touch the hourglass.
