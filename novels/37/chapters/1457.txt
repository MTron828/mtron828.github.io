Chapter 1458: Last Wishes

Translator: CKtalon

“Don’t talk; I’ll help treat you,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to use the power of Human Sovereign to treat Tsukuyomi.

Tsukuyomi reached out to grab Zhou Wen’s hand and coughed out blood. “It’s useless… Cough… I know my situation… Cough… A body of Calamity… Cough… It’s not something that can be treated with powers below the Calamity grade… Cough… Zhou Wen…”

Tsukuyomi’s fingers tightened their grip over Zhou Wen’s hand, but because her fingers were fractured, she couldn’t grip it tightly no matter how hard she tried.

“I’m here. Tell me.” Zhou Wen hurriedly held her hand with both hands and sent the power of Human Sovereign over.

“I… never knew what fear was in the past… but I’m afraid now… I’m really afraid…” Tsukuyomi’s face was pale and her breathing was weak. Her dim eyes were filled with fear. “You humans have this saying of reincarnation… That there’s a next life… Cough, cough… However, creatures like us have no family or friends. We have no connection to this world. Once we die, we will truly vanish into thin air. We won’t leave any traces in this world… Cough, cough… No one can prove that I existed in this world. It’s as if I never existed… I… I’m afraid… so, so afraid… I don’t know if I had ever existed… Cough, cough… Or should I say… My existence… was just a meaningless dream…”

“No, you exist.” Zhou Wen felt Tsukuyomi’s vitality weaken. It was useless even if he injected the power of Human Sovereign into her body. It was difficult to stop her vitality from weakening.

“Zhou Wen… You humans won’t understand… I’m not afraid of death… But I’m really afraid… I’m so afraid that I’ll be completely forgotten by this world… Can you help me leave something in this world… Even if it’s the most trivial thing…” Tsukuyomi spoke between breaths. From her situation, she seemed to be losing herself, her eyes about to close at any moment for all eternity.

“Tell me, what should I do?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

“I should have been satisfied… to be able to die in the arms of the person I love… Cough… But I’m a little greedy… I want more… I want to leave something in your life… Am I too greedy?” It felt like Tsukuyomi would stop breathing several times.

“No, humans are greedy to begin with. Your greed means that you are already someone like me,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh when he saw that Tsukuyomi’s situation wasn’t looking good.

“I’m really happy to hear you say that… Cough… Only you are willing to treat me as a person… If possible… I want to die as a person like you… As your wife… Even if it’s only in name… Cough… Even if there aren’t any traces of my existence in this world… At the very least, I’m still Mrs. Zhou…” As Tsukuyomi spoke, she kept coughing out blood.

“This…” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He never expected Tsukuyomi to make such a request.

“Sorry… I’ve made things difficult for you… I’m ultimately an anomaly… How am I qualified to be your wife… I’m not worthy of being Mrs. Zhou… Sorry… I… shouldn’t… have… said… these…” Tsukuyomi’s voice gradually weakened as her vitality was on the brink of drying up.

“No… You can of course…” Zhou Wen felt upset. He felt that he shouldn’t let Tsukuyomi die like this as he hugged her tightly.

“Don’t just talk… Use the ways you humans do it… to tell me the answer… It’s also the final farewell…” Tsukuyomi closed her eyes and pursed her blood-stained lips slightly.

Zhou Wen felt ambivalent. Seeing Tsukuyomi’s pale face which seemed to have blood receding from it, he couldn’t help but pity her. He lowered his head slightly and was about to plant it on her red lips.

Roar!

Just as Zhou Wen lowered his head, the stone beast that hadn’t rushed over for some reason suddenly roared and swept down from the sky like a huge meteor that could destroy a planet.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to carry Tsukuyomi and instant transmit away to dodge the stone beast’s pounce.

“I… won’t… make it soon…” Tsukuyomi’s breathing quickened as though her throat was stuffed.

“No…” Zhou Wen hugged Tsukuyomi and reached out to stroke her hair.

Roar!

The stone beast roared again, but this time, it didn’t lunge over. The stone monument that had been emitting light in midair suddenly shimmered as beams shot into the rocks. Stone pillars protruded from the surrounding stone walls and ground as they constantly struck Zhou Wen from all directions.

Zhou Wen continued his instant transmission, but the stone pillars were almost everywhere. The moment Zhou Wen phased into existence, a large number of stone pillars bombarded him, giving him no time to stop.

“I… I… I…” Tsukuyomi repeated the word a few times, but she failed to continue because Zhou Wen kept dodging the attacks of the stone beast and stone pillars.

She looked like she would stop breathing at any moment, but she didn’t expire.

“I…” Zhou Wen instant transmitted again. Tsukuyomi, who was about to speak, was interrupted again. Her face flushed red as she suddenly struggled out of Zhou Wen’s embrace. Her body floated in the air as her long hair danced. Her body emitted terrifying moonlight as she stared at the stone beast with eyes like a cold moon.

“Die!” Tsukuyomi gritted her teeth in extreme anger.

Accompanying her furious cry, the Calamity Zone was unleashed again. The surroundings turned black as she stood in midair like a bright moon. Countless ghosts appeared under the moonlight.

Crack! Crack!

The stone pillars that rushed out were shattered by the ghosts. The ghosts pounced at the stone beast and surrounded it, biting and attacking it.

Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

More than a hundred ghosts struck the stone beast with all sorts of strange forces, shattering the rocks on its body.

Although the offensive strength of every ghost wasn’t enough to severely injure the stone beast, more than a hundred ghosts kept bombarding it. The dense forces of various colors struck the stone beast, riddling it with holes.

Boom!

In just a few minutes, the stone beast’s body exploded, and the shattered rocks fell to the ground.

Zhou Wen’s mouth gaped open as he looked at Tsukuyomi in a daze. The power of the ghosts was clearly much stronger than before.

More importantly, Zhou Wen really couldn’t associate the present Tsukuyomi with the dying Tsukuyomi from a few minutes ago.

“What… What’s going on…” Zhou Wen stared at Tsukuyomi and asked.

Tsukuyomi’s angry emotions calmed down from shattering the stone beast. When she saw Zhou Wen’s questioning gaze, her body immediately turned limp. Like a weak and delicate princess, she held her forehead and fell into Zhou Wen’s arms.

“That was my last burst of strength… I really can’t make it now… Cough…” Tsukuyomi said as she leaned towards Zhou Wen. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Then continue with that final burst.” Zhou Wen was rendered speechless as he dodged and instant transmitted to the stone monument.

The stone beast’s body exploded as the stone monument fell to the ground. However, the symbols on it were still emitting light, allowing the surrounding rocks to continue growing.

If he didn’t finish off the stone monument, the entire dimensional zone would soon be filled with rocks..
