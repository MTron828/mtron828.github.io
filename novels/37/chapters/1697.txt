Chapter 1698 Sovereign of Humanity

“What a pity. It looks like your position as first place will change hands.” In the Family Clan of Gods, Mohe looked at Karoman and smiled.

“Since I know that there’s a hidden Star Palace, the first place will be mine sooner or later. Furthermore, it’s hard to say if he can clear the hidden Star Palace. Just a Companion Beast might not be able to deal with all situations,” said Karoman indifferently.

As the two of them spoke, Starlady Polestar opened her eyes in the Star Palace. Stars appeared in the sky and transformed into countless starlight beams that shot down, instantly lighting up the world. The entire Star Palace seemed to have turned into an endless universe. The entire Cube’s screen was occupied by the gorgeous starlight.

The calm expression on the face of Karoman changed immediately. Such an aura and form of strength were definitely not something the Starlords of the previous seven Star Palaces could compare with.

“Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array!” Zhang Chunqiu, who had always been calm, exclaimed involuntarily.

Even the low-level ordinary people could tell that this Starlady was very different when they saw the power that resembled the primordial universe.

Under the aura of the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, the average person felt as tiny as an ant or a speck of dust. Even through the screen, despair spread in their hearts.

Boom!

Golden streams of light erupted in the starlight like a golden flash that streaked across the galaxy. The battle had finally begun.

It was like a galaxy exploding as countless stars bloomed. Not to mention ordinary people, even the Calamity-grade representatives could hardly see what was happening inside.

As Karoman watched, he felt his body turn cold. His inner wear was drenched in cold

sweat.

There’s no way to fight her! These were the only words in Karoman’s heart. If he were to fight Starlady Polestar, he would probably be instantly killed.

“What the hell? Is Human Sovereign really that strong?” Xia Liuchuan’s mouth gaped open for a long time.

He couldn’t see the battle, but to be able to survive at such a level proved that Human Sovereign’s strength was extremely powerful. Xia Liuchuan knew very well that if he were to watch the battle inside, he would probably be reduced to nothing.

“Is Young Master Wen already that strong?” An Sheng’s face was filled with joy.

“All he knows is to show off all day. It’s as though he’s afraid that others won’t know who he is.” An Tianzuo’s tone was cold, but the corners of his mouth subconsciously curled up, forming a very beautiful arc.

Few humans could understand a battle at this level. Those who could were also alarmed.

“Has he already reached such a level?” In an uninhabited ancient city, an elder narrowed his eyes as he watched the battle on the Cube. It was none other than Jing Daoxian, who hadn’t appeared in a long time.

After watching for a while, Jing Daoxian stopped and turned to leave. He muttered to himself, “From the looks of it, I have to be faster. Otherwise, I really won’t be able to keep up with this era.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Everyone watching the battle felt the same. A chill ran down their spines as they couldn’t stop the fear in their hearts. Some with weaker willpower were trembling.

The apocalyptic clash made everyone feel tiny and powerless.

“This is what makes a f*cking Calamity!” It was unknown who sent such a comment. This sentence began to appear on all the programs on the Internet.

“Professor Gu, what level is this battle? Is this still at the Calamity grade?” Su Yi was dazzled as she muttered.

“I can only say that such a battle has already exceeded any known powerhouse at this stage. I have to apologize for my words. To be able to participate in such a battle, even if Human Sovereign doesn’t fight personally, it’s enough to prove that his strength is above all known humans.”

Professor Gu continued with a solemn expression, “If he really has a pure human body and hasn’t contracted a Guardian, then Human Sovereign is undoubtedly the sovereign of humanity. Such strength might meet its match in the future, but it’s definitely unprecedented. Only now do I know why Human Sovereign didn’t personally fight the Starlords from before. It’s because he finds it beneath him to do so. It’s just like a lofty emperor who doesn’t personally kill ordinary people. Those Starlords aren’t worthy of him taking action personally.”

“Now, I only hope that Human Sovereign can come out alive. If such a person dies in the Star Palace, it will be our greatest loss,” Professor Gu added with a heavy expression.

“May the heavens bless us. Let Human Sovereign win!” Su Yi’s palms were sweaty from nervousness.

“May the heavens bless him!” This sentence flooded the screen. Looking at the terrifying cosmic starlight, many people began praying for Human Sovereign.

When the twelve Star Palaces appeared, everyone felt as though the end of the world had arrived. It was also as though a divine punishment had appeared to punish the world.

Even watching the livestream through the screen made one have the urge to kneel down and pray and repent.

The twelve Star Palaces slowly came crashing down. It was suffocating. The twelve Star Palaces were like the power of the Heavenly Dao.

Everyone beneath the Heavenly Dao was an ant. Even the most unprecedented sage couldn’t escape the suppression of the heavens. Sooner or later, they would have to accept their fate.

“Don’t die!” Hui Haifeng’s forehead was covered in cold sweat as his eyes nearly popped out. They were bloodshot.

He regretted letting Zhou Wen step forward, but who the hell knew that Zhou Wen would do such a thing? If he really died inside, he wouldn’t know how to answer to himself.

Zhang Chunqiu and Xia Liuchuan also stared intently at the screen. Xia Liuchuan, who always liked to tease and couldn’t keep his mouth shut, seemed to be mute. He couldn’t say a word.

It was an indescribable pressure. Everyone felt as though an inescapable mountain of fate was pressing down on their chests. They were so uncomfortable that they were about to suffocate. It was as though the sky was about to collapse as despair involuntarily filled their minds.

Boom!

A dark-gold bolt of lightning shot up in defiance of the heavens, shattering a Star Palace. It was like the first ray of light in the extreme night, illuminating everyone’s hearts.

Boom! Boom!

Explosions sounded incessantly as the Star Palaces that represented fate were blasted to pieces. It was like a thunderclap that entered their ears, making the people who were about to suffocate shatter the mountains that pressed down on their chests. They couldn’t help but tremble as the despair in their hearts gradually turned into excitement.

Boom!

The moment the last Star Palace shattered, everyone’s bodies jolted before they heaved a long sigh as though they had put down a heavy burden.

The Star Palaces were destroyed as the starlight that filled the sky was extinguished. Only two figures remained standing proudly in the Star Palace. One of them looked up at the sky indifferently while the other was handsome and wild as he looked down at all life from above.
