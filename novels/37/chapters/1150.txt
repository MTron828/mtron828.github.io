Chapter 1151: Combination Ability

Hermit’s injured arm didn’t recover the entire time. In fact, Hermit was good at healing. He was the one who had previously treated Buzz’s injuries.

Nevertheless, his injuries had yet to recover. Although the bleeding from his severed arm wasn’t fast, the drops of blood slowly dripped to the ground. Clearly, it hadn’t healed.

Hermit felt as though a strange force was constantly corroding his wound, preventing it from healing itself. He didn’t dare escape because of the existence of this power.

Hermit had a vague feeling that the force was like a time bomb that could explode at any moment.

Although few people had seen Hermit’s true appearance, a person with a severed arm standing at the door of the lounge and bleeding profusely attracted the attention of many students. The news quickly reached the Cape family.

Buzz’s heart skipped a beat when he heard that and his expression changed drastically. He hurriedly rushed to school.

He didn’t dare go to the lounge directly. Instead, he checked the situation through the surveillance cameras and watched the previous surveillance footage.

After he had seen everything, the shock in his heart was unimaginable.

Ordinary students didn’t know who Hermit was or what kind of existence he was, but Buzz knew very well.

Despite being the powerful and terrifying Hermit, the young man didn’t even move his hand. Just by looking at Hermit, he had blasted off one of Hermit’s arms, forcing him to obediently stand at the door as a guard. What terrifying strength was this?

Due to Clown Mask being at the Terror grade, ordinary humans couldn’t see it, much less the recording. Therefore, Buzz didn’t see Clown Mask appear. All he saw was Hermit’s arm suddenly explode for no reason.

Who is he? Ming Xiu actually has such a teacher? It’s no wonder he could rapidly rise in just a few years. Who is this person? He definitely didn’t contract a Guardian. He doesn’t look like he has fused with a Guardian or dimensional creature...

The more Buzz observed the situation, the more alarmed he became.

After the observation, the clothes on Buzz’s back were drenched. He was already somewhat glad that Ming Xiu had injured him and not the other way around.

If he had angered such an existence, he didn’t know what the outcome would have been. Just the thought of a person that even Hermit didn’t dare disobey was terrifying.

Thankfully, Beryl has hit it off with that person. He shouldn’t make things difficult for our Cape family, right? Buzz didn’t dare be negligent. He immediately got someone to seal the area near the lounge, preventing students and teachers from going there.

Of course, he stayed far away and pretended not to know anything.

Beryl stood in the lounge, feeling uneasy. She couldn’t sit or stand. Her palms were sweaty from nervousness.

In her eyes, Ming Xiu was already an extremely powerful existence. Hermit was an extremely terrifying expert, but in front of this young man who looked to be in his twenties, they didn’t seem as grandiose as she imagined.

So Professor Ming actually has such a powerful coach. It’s no wonder he’s so strong. However, this person doesn’t look much older than Professor Ming. Could it be that he’s actually an old monster that’s over a hundred years old despite looking young? That’s right. That must be it. Beryl thought to herself.

Zhou Wen ignored Beryl as he studied his Essence Energy Art.

Previously, he had circulated the Small Perfection of Wisdom, Godfiend Era, and Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder at the same time. The Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder had always taken on a supportive role, so there weren’t many changes.

However, when Zhou Wen used Great Brahma and Clown Mask at the same time, there was an unexpected change.

Zhou Wen kept using Great Brahma to lock onto the micro crystal. At the same time, he used Clown Mask’s spatial teleportation ability to teleport the micro crystal behind Hermit.

The powers of Great Brahma and Clown Mask acted on the micro crystal at the same time, producing a special effect. Even Zhou Wen never expected the two powers to combine.

After Clown Mask’s spatial ability combined with Great Brahma’s karmic sinflames, it formed a spatial coordinate on the injured Hermit’s arm wound. Zhou Wen could directly teleport his powers there without any intermediate processes. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, the only power that could teleport there was Brahma’s karmic sinflames—nothing else.

Even so, it was already extremely useful. As long as he was hit by Zhou Wen’s strike and his coordinates marked, the subsequent karmic sinflames could be acted on his wounds until he died.

Zhou Wen was experimenting to see if there was any possibility of further fusion between Clown Mask and Great Brahma. If they could cooperate further, they might be able to produce even more terrifying powers.

Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, Ming Xiu’s body suddenly emitted a powerful sword intent fluctuation. Furthermore, his body began to undergo a strange transformation.

His skin, that was originally like milky-white jade, became even more crystalline. A strange energy fluctuation gradually spread from his body.

Slowly, Ming Xiu’s body became more and more transparent before disappearing from sight. The sword intent also vanished.

Eh! Zhou Wen looked in surprise at the spot where Ming Xiu had vanished.

He could sense that Ming Xiu had reached the stage of Terror transformation, but even so, Zhou Wen should have been able to see him with his Wheel of Destiny activated.

Strangely, Zhou Wen couldn’t see Ming Xiu. He seemed to have really vanished.

However, Ming Xiu soon appeared in his vision again. At that moment, Ming Xiu had returned to his normal human form. He was even more normal than before.

“Coach, this is your wife, right? Ma’am is really amazing. She really enlightened me with one sentence. I finally understood the profundity of time and completely absorbed the Mythical Serum. If it wasn’t for her, I don’t know when I would have been able to completely absorb it. Coach is indeed a coach. Not only is he strong himself, but even his wife is so strong...” Ming Xiu said excitedly.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to explain, Tsukuyomi smiled and handed a sword to Ming Xiu. “Take this as a gift from me then.”

“Thank you, Ma’am.” Ming Xiu happily received the sword. He didn’t really think that the sword was good, but he was just happy.

However, when he truly experienced the power of the sword in the future, he would realize how precious it was.

“Ming Xiu, you have to thank this student. She took a huge risk to inform you.” Zhou Wen hurriedly changed the topic, unwilling to harp on this matter.

Ming Xiu looked at Beryl in puzzlement, unsure what had happened.

Zhou Wen recounted what had happened. After Ming Xiu heard that, he thanked Beryl.

As for Hermit, Ming Xiu didn’t do anything to him. Instead, after getting Zhou Wen’s permission, he released him.

Zhou Wen could roughly guess what Ming Xiu was thinking, so he didn’t ask further. However, after seeing Ming Xiu, he missed his friends and family even more.

Looking at Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and decided to take her back to Luoyang.
