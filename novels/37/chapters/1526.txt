Chapter 1527 The Gem on the Ring

Demonic Neonate wanted to reach out to pluck the girl’s ring, but after some hesitation, she didn’t extend her hand. She turned to look at Zhou Wen with a pleading look in her eyes.

“Grim Demon, do you know the origins of this girl?” Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon.

“I’ve never seen her before. At the very least, she didn’t appear in the wars of the Mythical era.” Grim Demon looked carefully for a while and said after some thought, “However, to be protected by these seven extraordinary devils, she must have a huge background. It’s best not to touch her if possible.”

Zhou Wen also felt that it was best not to touch her if he could. She resembled Sweetie too much. If she was really as powerful as Sweetie, it would be impossible to take anything from her.

However, this girl looked lifeless. The huge commotion just now hadn’t woken her up. She might already be dead.

Zhou Wen decided to give it a try after looking down at Demonic Neonate and seeing her expectant gaze. Zhou Wen knew that although his level was higher than Demonic Neonate’s, it wasn’t that much safer for him to retrieve something that Demonic Neonate couldn’t.

After summoning and putting on the Prisoned Dragon armor, Zhou Wen gathered all his strength to defend himself. Only then did he reach out to take off the girl’s ring. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The seven devils bared their teeth as though they wanted to skin Zhou Wen alive. Demonic Neonate glared at them before they immediately shrank back, only to glare at Zhou Wen from below.

Bang!

Just as Zhou Wen’s fingers touched the ring, he felt a powerful expelled force. His body slammed into the wall like a pellet.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen summoned the Chaos Egg in time. It bounced back and forth between the walls before slowly stopping.

Why is this power much stronger than when Demonic Neonate made the attempt? Zhou Wen spat out a mouthful of blood.

Although Demonic Neonate had been repelled by the force when retrieving it, the force was clearly much weaker than Zhou Wen’s attempt. Otherwise, Demonic Neonate’s body probably wouldn’t have been able to withstand the instantaneous force that sent her flying

Zhou Wen returned to the platform and looked at the silver-haired girl with a frown; he had no idea if she was alive or dead.

He had pretty good recovery abilities, so his injuries were slowly recovering, but even if he recovered, he probably couldn’t take the ring if he tried the same method.

Demonic Neonate was still staring at the ring. Clearly, she was very concerned about it.

Zhou Wen stared at the ring for a while longer. The ring was made of metal, but he didn’t know what metal it was. The gem wasn’t a diamond. Amidst its crystalline appearance, there was a faint blue tinge.

It was clearly transparent, but no matter how he looked at it, he couldn’t see the gem’s interior.

“Do you want the ring or the gem?” Zhou Wen asked Demonic Neonate.

“Gem,” Demonic Neonate hurriedly said.

“That makes things easier.” Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and got it to snip at the ring’s metal ring with Clean Break.

Clang!

With a metallic clang, the Golden Wyrm Scissors, which could split Hell-level creatures and weapons into two, failed to leave a mark on the metal ring.

Instead, the Golden Wyrm Scissors was sent flying, nearly grazing Zhou Wen’s cheek. If Zhou Wen hadn’t dodged quickly, half his head would have been chopped off.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors stabbed into the wall, leaving only the handle outside. The Golden Wyrm Scissors trembled for a while before flying back out.

Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. The powerful destructive power of the Golden Wyrm Scissors failed to injure the ring. It was probably very difficult to remove the ring.

Demonic Neonate wanted the ring so much, so it was probably essential to her. It was very likely to help her evolve. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to give up just like that.

It was too difficult to evolve Demonic Neonate. She didn’t eat crystals at all. Ordinary things couldn’t help her evolve. It wasn’t easy for him to find something she needed, so he had to give it another try.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and summoned the Immortal Culling Sword again. He slashed at the ring with all his might.

Clang!

Zhou Wen’s Immortal Culling Sword flew out, but the ring remained unharmed.

What’s this ring? Is this girl really Satan? Zhou Wen increasingly felt that the possibility of the girl being Satan was very high.

In many legends, Satan was a monster like a snake or a crimson dragon, but the girl in front of him was abnormally beautiful. If she was Satan, Zhou Wen was more willing to believe that Satan and Lucifer were the same person.

Sweetie is God, so Lucifer, the fallen angel, is this girl. It seems reasonable. After all, angels are also created by God. Perhaps Lucifer was created in God’s image. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to give it another try.

Since it was impossible to forcefully snap the ring, Zhou Wen could only think of a way to remove it from the girl’s finger.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen cultivated in many Essence Energy Arts. He circulated different Essence Energy Arts, hoping that there was a power that prevented the ring or the girl’s powers from rejecting him. Perhaps he could successfully remove the ring.

Bang!

The First Order of Chaos failed to succeed as Zhou Wen was sent flying.

Bang!

The Dao Sutra failed as well.

Bang! Bang!

The Qi Refinement Art, Demon God Bloodline Catalog, Godfiend Era, and other Essence Energy Arts failed one after another. As long as he touched the ring, Zhou Wen would immediately be repelled.

Zhou Wen wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and walked to the girl’s side again. This time, he circulated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. This was already his last Essence Energy Art. If it didn’t work, he would probably have to give up.

The Human Sovereign glow on Zhou Wen’s body bloomed, turning him into a blob of light. He extended his glowing palm and touched the ring again.

Bang!

Zhou Wen was sent flying faster than ever, almost at light speed. He slammed into the wall before he could even summon the Chaos

Egg.

With a loud boom, even the extremely hard and thick wall collapsed.

Cracks appeared on Zhou Wen’s Prisoned Dragon armor as a large area on his back shattered.

Pfft! Blood spewed out of Zhou Wen’s mouth as he struggled to get onto his feet a few times, but to no avail. He felt as though his body had fallen apart with an unknown number of bones shattering.

Demonic Neonate came to Zhou Wen’s side and sized up his injuries. Her eyes were filled with anxiety as she shook her head at him as though she wanted to tell him not to try again. She didn’t want the gem anymore.

Zhou Wen summoned a Mythical pill essence and swallowed it as a pill. His injuries rapidly healed and he quickly recovered.

Zhou Wen stood up and wanted to walk towards the girl, but Demonic Neonate grabbed his clothes.

“Don’t want.” Demonic Neonate shook her head at Zhou Wen with a firm gaze.

“I’ve already tried so many times, so one more won’t make a difference.” Zhou Wen wanted to try again without using any other powers; he would only use the Lost Immortal Sutra this time.
