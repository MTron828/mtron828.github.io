Chapter 963: Heavenly Happiness Token

Zhou Wen looked at the dragon queen in surprise. He never expected her to say such a thing even in his wildest imagination.

He was a pure human, while the dragon queen was a dimensional creature. They weren’t of the same species. How could he become the son-in-law of the Dragon Palace?

Furthermore, Zhou Wen had never thought of marriage. All he could do was say, “Thank you for your kindness, but I have no intention of getting married.”

When the dragon queen heard Zhou Wen’s answer, her expression immediately turned cold. “You can only choose one of two choices—die or become the Dragon Palace’s son-in-law.”

Zhou Wen looked at the dragon queen with an odd expression and asked, “There are plenty of humans. If you want to get married, many human men should be willing. Why must you choose me?”

The dragon queen said with a cold expression, “A mere human doesn’t even have the right to look at me.”

“Aren’t I human?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

The dragon queen didn’t answer. She only stared at him coldly and said, “Answer me immediately. Are you willing to become the Dragon Palace’s son-in-law or do you want to die here?”

“Sorry, I don’t plan on getting married.” Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t choose to be the Dragon Palace’s son-in-law. They weren’t of the same species.

The dragon queen immediately turned hostile. “Take him down.”

With the order issued by the dragon queen, a shrimp soldier immediately rushed forward and thrust its shrimp-headed spear at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen used his movement technique and rushed towards the cabin’s exit.

The row of shrimp soldiers guarding the exit also thrust their spears at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen unsheathed Bamboo Blade and sliced off the shrimp-headed spear in front of him. Zhou Wen carried Ya’er to the deck.

The Turtle Minister was standing on the deck. His previous humble attitude was completely gone. He carried the huge spear and smashed it at Zhou Wen.

The spear was fast and ferocious. Furthermore, it was extremely heavy. Zhou Wen guessed that his Strength probably couldn’t withstand such a powerful attack, so he could only use his movement technique to dodge.

The Turtle Minister brandished the spear like a raging wind sweeping away fallen leaves. His massive body didn’t show any signs of clumsiness. Zhou Wen dodged left and right. Although he dodged the attacks, he was momentarily unable to shake off the Turtle Minister.

The Turtle Minister is already so ferocious. That dragon queen must be even more terrifying. Zhou Wen didn’t panic. He had the ability to teleport and conceal himself. Even if he couldn’t defeat her, he could escape.

This fellow is completely different from the Turtle Prime Minister in myths and legends. He’s practically a super Berserker! Zhou Wen realized that the Turtle Minister was becoming more and more ferocious as the battle progressed. Furthermore, it was invulnerable. Zhou Wen’s attacks didn’t pose much of a threat to it, so he didn’t wish to be entangled with it. He directly switched to the New Era Life Soul and used his teleportation ability to rush out of the Dragon Palace and into the sea.

No matter how ferocious the Turtle Minister was, he couldn’t catch up to Zhou Wen who had teleported. After a few teleportations, Zhou Wen had already left the Turtle Minister in the dust.

Just as he was about to swim out of the sea, he suddenly saw a golden figure flash. It was the dragon queen in golden dragon scales. She had a hot figure, but her fists were even more explosive than her figure. With a single punch, the seawater formed a terrifying vortex under her fist, causing Zhou Wen’s body to involuntarily be sucked towards her fist.

Zhou Wen hurriedly used teleportation to rush out of the terrifying fist’s range, but just as he teleported out, the dragon queen appeared in front of him. The terrifying fist was about to land on Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to teleport again, but he failed to escape the dragon queen despite teleporting several times. Every time he teleported, the dragon queen would appear in front of him.

What was even more terrifying was that Zhou Wen should have escaped the sea after teleporting so many times. Yet, instead of arriving at the beach, all he could see was endless seawater as though he was still deep in the sea.

“Where we are is known as Deep Blue. No matter how powerful you are, you won’t be able to escape the sea. Agree to becoming the Dragon Palace’s son-in-law and I can still spare you,” the dragon queen said as she pursued Zhou Wen.

“What do you see in me? I’ll change, alright?” Zhou Wen said speechlessly.

“Unless you die, you have to become the Dragon Palace’s son-in-law.” The dragon queen wasn’t human. She couldn’t hear the sarcasm in Zhou Wen’s words.

“You are a dragon and I’m a human. We aren’t of the same species. It’s impossible for us to copulate,” Zhou Wen said as he dodged. At the same time, he was thinking of a way to escape.

“Who said I’m copulating with you? I want you to become the Dragon Palace’s son-in-law by marrying my sister. She has half a human’s bloodline,” said the dragon queen.

“Wait, you mean you want me to marry your sister? But I’ve never seen your sister. Who’s your sister?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.

The dragon queen stood opposite Zhou Wen and didn’t continue attacking. She took out a clam and opened it. Immediately, light shot out from the shell like a holographic projection. The light condensed into a woman’s figure.

“Qin Ling!” Zhou Wen cried out when he saw the woman’s figure.

Without a doubt, that figure was none other than Qin Ling. It was impossible to mistake it.

“You’ve met her? That’s great. In that case, stay in the Dragon Palace and wait to marry my sister,” said the dragon queen.

“Wait!” Zhou Wen extended his hand to stop the dragon queen who was about to capture him. He looked at the dragon queen and said, “If your sister is really Qin Ling, she already has a fiancé and they have a good relationship. I think even if I were willing to marry her, she wouldn’t be willing to marry me. I think you are mistaken. It’s best you ask your sister first.”

The dragon queen said coldly, “Ordinary humans aren’t qualified to marry my sister.”

“Your sister’s fiancé isn’t an ordinary human. He’s very talented and will definitely become a top expert in the future. He’s far better than me...” Zhou Wen praised Feng Qiuyun to no end.

However, his words were sincere. Feng Qiuyan’s talent was indeed unparalleled. Furthermore, he was very diligent, no less than Zhou Wen.

“It’s useless no matter how outstanding he is. Without the recognition of the dimension’s rules, it’s impossible for them to marry,” said the dragon queen.

“What dimension’s rules? I’m also a human. If he isn’t acknowledged, I won’t be acknowledged either, right?” Zhou Wen was even more puzzled.

“You are different. You have already been acknowledged,” said the dragon queen.

“I’ve been acknowledged? When?” Zhou Wen was even more puzzled. He didn’t have a seal of approval on his head, so why did the dragon queen say that he had been acknowledged? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The dragon queen snorted and said, “You’re still acting dumb. Do you think I don’t recognize the Heavenly Happiness Token?”

“Heavenly Happiness Token?” Zhou Wen immediately realized something as he hurriedly took out the stone token that Emperor of Shang had given him. “You mean this?”
