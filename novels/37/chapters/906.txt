Chapter 907: Fatal Temptation

Translator: CKtalon

“That can’t be real, right? Heavy-Armored Titan and Tyrant Behemoth shouldn’t be too different. How did it get instantly killed?”

“What was that? Am I seeing things?”

“Is Heavy-Armored Titan so inferior to Tyrant Behemoth?”

...

Everyone broke into a flurry of discussion. The scene of Great Skyfiend instantly killing the Heavy-Armored Titan was too shocking. Even the members of the six families did not expect that Heavy-Armored Titan, who specialized in defense, would die so quickly.

Uesugi Nao’s mood finally improved a little. She had helped Great Skyfiend redeem himself. At the same time, she had also exposed part of Great Skyfiend’s abilities.

However, there was nothing she could do about it. If she took too long to finish off Heavy-Armored Titan, the other families would think that Great Skyfiend was easy to deal with. They would constantly send Mythical creatures to test Great Skyfiend’s strength. That would be even more troublesome.

Now that she had killed Heavy-Armored Titan in one strike, anyone who wanted to test Great Skyfiend’s strength had to consider whether they could afford to lose their Mythical creature.

Even if the number of Mythical Companion Beasts in the six families kept increasing, few people would be willing to lose their Mythical Companion Beasts.

...

What kind of power was that strike? Zhou Wen thought about the crux of Great Skyfiend’s strike.

It was clearly not a simple clash of strength. Even Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength couldn’t blast through the Heavy-Armored Titan’s armor in one strike, much less shatter it into pieces.

The power of Great Skyfiend clearly had a special effect. That was why Heavy-Armored Titan couldn’t even block a single strike.

However, even if he saw the process with his own eyes, he couldn’t accurately determine what kind of power it was because there were too many possibilities.

It could be the power to something akin to Life Blast. As long as he touched his opponent, he could detonate the opponent’s energy.

It could also be a penetrative power that directly penetrated the heavy armor and destroyed the heavy titan’s body from the inside, preventing it from putting up a resistance.

There were several possibilities that he could think of, and there were also possibilities that he couldn’t think of.

However, after witnessing Great Skyfiend’s attack, he definitely couldn’t let the demonic flames on Uesugi Nao’s body touch him when he fought her again.

...

“Although Heavy-Armored Titan isn’t bad, it’s still much weaker than Tyrant Behemoth. Tyrant Behemoth can defeat Great Skyfiend, but Heavy-Armored Titan can’t even withstand one strike. The difference is too great.”

“I hope Tyrant Behemoth can step forward to challenge Great Skyfiend and snatch back first place. Let those fellows overseas know how powerful we from the Federation are.”

Many people hoped that Tyrant Behemoth could step forward to fight, but Zhou Wen had no intention of doing so.

He hadn’t figured out Great Skyfiend’s exact abilities, and Zhou Wen couldn’t participate in the battle himself. Sending Tyrant Behemoth to challenge Uesugi Nao was no different from sending himself to his death.

I should quickly advance to the Mythical stage. Zhou Wen constantly absorbed Essence Energy Crystals in-game, hoping to quickly raise the Essence Energy Pill’s level.

Ding! After killing Medusa in her demoness state, an Essence Energy Skill Crystal dropped.

Zhou Wen deliberately waited for Medusa to become a demoness before killing her. He had killed Medusa several times while she was in her maiden form, but nothing dropped.

As for Zhou Wen, he had seen Medusa drop two Essence Energy Skill Crystals when he was previously grinding.

One required 41 Constitution and 21 Cursed stat, while the other required 41 Essence Energy and 21 Poison stat. Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy and Poison stat had already met the requirements, so he had been grinding Medusa recently in hopes of obtaining the skill crystal that needed 41 Essence Energy.

Two days ago, he had also obtained a Medusa crystal. Unfortunately, it was the type with a 41 Constitution requirement. Zhou Wen wasn’t able to absorb it, so he had to give it up during a respawn.

Give me the 41 Essence Energy one! Zhou Wen prayed inwardly as he picked it up and was immediately overjoyed. It was the skill crystal that required Essence Energy and Poison stats.

I can finally absorb a Mythical skill! Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to absorb the Essence Energy Skill Crystal.

The crystal transformed into a grayish-white Essence Energy stream that entered the blood-colored avatar’s body. Zhou Wen immediately felt as though his body was being pricked by needles wherever the Essence Energy stream passed.

The Essence Energy constantly circulated in Zhou Wen’s body, forcefully opening up his meridians. After more than an hour, the Essence Energy formed a circulation and finally, all the Essence Energy flowed into Zhou Wen’s hair.

‘Absorbed Medusa Crystal. Attained Mythical Essence Energy Skill: Fatal Temptation.’

It’s indeed not the Eyes of Petrification... Zhou Wen had long guessed that the Essence Energy Skill Crystal that required Constitution and Cursed was the Eyes of Petrification.

What skill is this Fatal Temptation? It has a Poison stat requirement. Don’t tell me it turns my hair into venomous snakes? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel uneasy when he thought of his head full of venomous snakes. Such a skill felt a little odd and difficult to accept.

He nervously looked at the introduction of Fatal Temptation and realized that it was indeed a hair skill. He was alarmed, but after carefully reading the introduction, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Legend had it that Medusa had the most beautiful long hair in the world. As a result, she became too proud and looked down on Athena, and was turned into a snake-haired demoness.

Fatal Temptation was a skill that allowed one’s hair to be tainted with poison. However, it didn’t turn into venomous snakes. If anyone touched the poisonous hair, they would be poisoned. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhou Wen tried using the Fatal Temptation skill. With a move of his Essence Energy, Zhou Wen’s hair immediately grew crazily and in a blink of an eye, it reached the ground.

However, Zhou Wen knew that it wasn’t real hair, but hair condensed from Essence Energy.

With a thought, Zhou Wen realized that it was extremely difficult to control the Poison Hair condensed from Essence Energy. It was unrealistic to use it as a weapon.

Could it be that I can only passively wait for others to touch my hair? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. Such a skill wasn’t something he needed.

However, on second thought, Zhou Wen had an idea. He pulled out a strand of Essence Energy Poison Hair and placed it in water. The Essence Energy Poison Hair immediately dissolved into the water.

Soon, many dimensional creatures in the water were poisoned to death.

So this skill can also be used as poison. In that case, it’s not bad. However, I wonder how potent the poison of Fatal Temptation is. Can it poison a Mythical creature to death? Zhou Wen studied it for a long time and roughly learned how to use Fatal Temptation.

In fact, there was no need for it to be in water. Even in air, Fatal Temptation could emit poisonous fumes, just like perfume. Any creature that smelled it would be poisoned.

However, the poison wasn’t as potent as Zhou Wen imagined. It was somewhat difficult to poison a Mythical creature to death unless a Mythical creature directly swallowed a large amount of Essence Energy Poison Hair.

If he could do that, Zhou Wen had a high chance of killing the Mythical creature himself. There was no need for him to go through so much trouble.

However, if this skill was used against humans, the effects would be very powerful. This was because humans were at the Epic stage at best. Just the poisonous gas emitted from the Poison Hair was enough to deal great damage to humans.
