Chapter 1278: Absolute Space

Translator: CKtalon

“But Yana is my friend,” the little girl said.

The servant giant immediately said, “Mistress, Yana is only a lowly creature in the Ancient Forbidden Land. What right does she have to be your friend? When you were out touring the Ancient Forbidden Land, you made her your maid. It was already a great blessing for her to be by your side and serve you. Yet, she was disrespectful towards you and had the nerve to become your friend. She even stole your things. She deserves death.”

“But…” The little girl’s mouth moved, wanting to say something, but in the end, she didn’t say anything. She hugged a panda doll that was about her height and lay down again. After closing her eyes, she said, “Little Chrysanthemum, I’m tired and need some rest. You may take your leave.”

“Yes, Mistress.” The servant giant carefully closed the coffin lid again before carefully leaving the room, as though he was afraid of disturbing the girl’s rest.

After the giant left, the girl opened her eyes again and blinked. She secretly opened the crystal coffin lid and crawled out.

After taking a few steps, she seemed to think of something. She looked back at the empty crystal coffin and the panda doll in her arms. Finally, she reluctantly placed the panda doll into the crystal coffin.

“You don’t have to worry. I’ll be back as soon as I resolve Yana’s matter,” the girl said as she reached out and kissed the panda’s forehead. A petite and cute lipstick mark was left on it.

Instantly, the panda doll took on the little girl’s looks and lay peacefully in the crystal coffin.

…

People originally imagined that Human Sovereign would attempt the Venusian dimensional zone and obtain first place, but this didn’t happen. Human Sovereign vanished after slaying the six-winged seraphim.

Zhou Wen wasn’t lucky on his return to Earth. He arrived at a desolate swamp with many dimensional zones around him. He was contemplating a route back to a human city. At the very least, he had to go to a place with a network signal to know if there were any creatures challenging the Venusian dimensional zone again.

However, before Zhou Wen could return to human territory, a creature had already entered the Venusian dimensional zone.

The person who entered the Venusian dimensional zone this time was the previously-seen black-winged seraphim. He wasn’t as noble as Yana, nor was he as holy.

His black wings had a few white feathers in them. He wasn’t wearing any armor, but he was wearing a robe that didn’t look very clean. It was similar to priest robes.

The Cube lit up. When people saw that it wasn’t Human Sovereign who had entered the dimensional zone, they couldn’t help but be disappointed.

However, what happened next shocked everyone.

The black-winged seraphim held a black leather-bound book. After entering the Venusian dimensional zone, he didn’t even look up when facing the bullets shot out by the Metal Guard. All he did was calmly flip open the black leather-bound book.

It was completely uneventful. People only saw him flip through the book. No one saw what happened next. The Metal Guard and his bullet vanished.

This kept repeating. The Metal Guards, Golden Battle Gods, came out one after another and then mysteriously vanished.

Finally, the Calamity bullet shot out. People only saw the black-winged seraphim flip open the book—they didn’t see how the black-winged seraphim entered the maze and how he arrived in front of the Golden Palace. But they found him standing there eventually.

The Cube showed the rankings again. The words ‘The Fallen’ appeared in second place. Behind The Fallen were four golden stars.

“Professor Gu, what do you think of the newly-appeared Fallen?” Everyone in the Federation was discussing The Fallen. The Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau was naturally doing programs regarding The Fallen.

Professor Gu said, “The situation now is relatively clear. Only creatures that have reached the Golden Palace can enter the rankings. Up to now, a total of two have been on the rankings. The first is Tsukuyomi. There are five stars behind her. The second is The Fallen. There are four stars behind him, so he’s second while Tsukuyomi is first. The number of stars should determine the rankings.”

“Many people believe that from the performance of the dimensional zones, Tsukuyomi is weaker than The Fallen, but her ranking is higher than The Fallen. What do you think about this?” the host asked again.

“Superficially, it’s indeed true that The Fallen appears to be stronger and more mysterious. Furthermore, Tsukuyomi reached the Golden Palace with the help of Looter King. However, this doesn’t mean that The Fallen is really stronger than Tsukuyomi. The Fallen’s abilities are still presently unknown. It’s difficult to determine what happened after he opened the black leather-bound book. It’s still difficult to make conclusions,” Professor Gu said ambiguously.

When Zhou Wen returned to inhabited areas, he learned about The Fallen. However, there was clearly nothing to pick up this time. It was useless even if he returned early.

Zhou Wen continued grinding in-game. He grinded the Venusian instance dungeon once a day, hoping to find a way to clear it.

Zhou Wen even tried using the Prisoned Dragon armor to block the Calamity-grade bullets and really managed to block them. Although the armor was riddled with bullet holes and dents, the bullets failed to penetrate.

Of course, this was only referring to the first six bullets. The seventh bullet blasted open the blood-colored avatar’s head. Even Absolute Defense failed to withstand it.

It’s already quite impressive to be able to withstand the first six Calamity-grade bullets. From the looks of it, I need to think of another way to deal with the seventh bullet.?Zhou Wen took out the Spacetime Piglet Crystal he had obtained from the Chaos Hut.

I hope it’s a spatial extension skill.?Zhou Wen absorbed it. It was a Mythical crystal of a spatial type, so Zhou Wen easily met the absorption requirement.

Seeing the Spacetime Piglet Crystal fuse into his body and open up a new Essence Energy circulation, Zhou Wen vaguely felt that his wish had come true.

Absolute Space: Mythical

After Zhou Wen carefully studied it, he realized that it was indeed similar to spatial extension, but it was still somewhat different.

This ability couldn’t really extend space. It could only create a special space—Absolute Space.

In Absolute Space, space could be changed. Absolute Space was like a spatial map. It was to scale with reality. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

What appeared only a meter long in reality still looked like a meter in Absolute Space, but in fact, this space had already become a thousand meters.

In fact, Zhou Wen still wasn’t capable of such a feat. He had just learned Absolute Space and could only reach a ratio of 1:10. Furthermore, the Absolute Space he could create was only the size of a chicken egg.

Even if the space inside such a tiny space is ten times bigger than in reality, it’s impossible for it to withstand the Calamity-grade bullet.?Zhou Wen knew that he had to raise Absolute Space to the Terror grade to even have an iota of hope.

It was still hope nonetheless, so Zhou Wen began practicing.
