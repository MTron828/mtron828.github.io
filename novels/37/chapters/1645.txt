Chapter 1646 Besieging

The Companion Beast threw a punch at Xiao’s abdomen, but Xiao’s figure turned into an illusion, causing the punch to pass through his body and fail to injure him.

Xiao’s true body appeared on the other side of the Companion Beast and similarly threw a punch at its head.

The Companion Beast seemed to be unable to dodge in time and was struck in the head by Xiao’s punch. However, Xiao’s fist passed through its head, missing it-it was actually an illusion.

Xiao’s pupils suddenly constricted as he immediately turned his head. He saw an identical Companion Beast appear in another direction. The Companion Beast’s fist was already in front of his face.

In an exchange between reality and illusion, Xiao returned to the phantom from before. The body that had been struck in the face had turned into an illusion.

However, when Xiao returned, he realized that the Companion Beast he thought was an illusion had similarly struck his abdomen. A terrifying force entered his body through his abdomen, causing his muscles and bones to tremble. He suddenly flew out and barely stopped after traveling dozens of kilometers in the air.

Isn’t that Xiao’s ability? The Companion Beast actually learned it! Zhou Wen and Jiuyang were alarmed when they saw the Companion Beast’s phantom vanish from midair, leaving only its true body.

Xiao’s ability wasn’t only limited to the power of the Trajectory Holy Temple, but it was also supplemented by his own insights and mental mutations. Even a Saint of the Trajectory Holy Temple couldn’t master such an ability.

The Companion Beast could actually imitate it and use such an ability to injure Xiao. It was obvious how terrifying it was.

The Companion Beast’s figure flashed as it arrived in front of Zhou Wen. Its fist struck Zhou Wen’s abdomen at an indiscernible speed.

Zhou Wen pushed Transcendent Flying Immortal to its limits as his figure gracefully drew an arc, dodging the Companion Beast’s repeated attacks.

The Companion Beast’s entire body was like a weapon as it dealt an onslaught of attacks at Zhou Wen. After a round of attacks, it failed to injure him.

Suddenly, it opened its mouth and a white beam flashed. The white light was so fast that even Transcendent Flying Immortal couldn’t dodge it. His body was bound by a white object – the tongue of the Companion Beast.

This fellow actually learned Toad Immortal’s move! Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade in one hand and slashed at the tongue that bound his body.

With the sharpness of the Bamboo Blade and Zhou Wen’s strength, this strike only left a shallow wound. It failed to sever the tongue.

Having dealt such a wound, it would probably require dozens of slashes to sever the tongue.

Zhou Wen didn’t have that much time. The tongue yanked him towards the Companion Beast and instantly made him arrive in front of it. He was about to be pulled into its open mouth.

Sun God Light tore through the sky like an aurora and struck the Companion Beast. The Companion Beast had no choice but to dodge the Sun God Light’s attack, preventing Zhou Wen from being pulled into its mouth.

At that moment, Xiao rushed over. While the Companion Beast dodged the Sun God Light, he appeared behind Zhou Wen like a ghost. His fingers were like blades as he repeatedly slashed at his tongue. The power that could slice through the void left deep marks on his tongue.

Feeling pain in its tongue, the Companion Beast released Zhou Wen and retracted the tongue back into its mouth.

“Jiuyang, come over. Attack together,” Xiao shouted at Jiuyang. Jiuyang had already rushed over. At the same time, the electromagnetic monster that was chasing after him rushed over.

Zhou Wen immediately understood what Xiao was up to. The three of them were to attack the Companion Beast together. Although the electromagnetic monster was an enemy, the enemies combined might not necessarily become stronger enemies.

However, the three of them together would become stronger. Zhou Wen used Transcendent Flying Immortal. He was as agile and elegant as a true immortal in the sky. As he besieged the Companion Beast, he used the electromagnetic monster to restrain the Companion Beast’s attacks.

Although the electromagnetic monster was also at the Heaven level, its intelligence was ordinary to begin with. Furthermore, after being controlled by the Companion Beast’s power, it only had the instinct to fight.

Its arrival provided cover for Zhou Wen and company. From time to time, they would position themselves to exploit the electromagnetic monster for blocking the Companion Beast’s attacks.

Zhou Wen’s Bamboo Blade drew out arcs as it slashed at the Companion Beast from different directions.

Jiuyang’s Sun God Light struck the Companion Beast from different directions again and again. Xiao’s phantoms surrounded the Companion Beast from every direction. Although this was the first time the three of them were working together, they seemed to be telepathically connected. Their teamwork was flawless.

Bang!

After all, it was difficult for the Companion Beast to fight six hands with two fists. In a moment of carelessness, Jiuyang struck its back with the Sun God Fist. Its white jade-like muscles were charred black by the Sun God Light.

While the Companion Beast was staggering, Zhou Wen’s saber and Xiao’s fingers constantly slashed at it. Zhou Wen’s Bamboo Blade left saber marks on the Companion Beast’s body.

Xiao’s fingers constantly ripped through the Companion Beast’s body as Jiuyang’s fists struck out repeatedly. The three of them unleashed their strongest strength as they attacked the Companion Beast’s body from three different directions.

The Companion Beast staggered from the beating as the wounds on its body increased significantly. At that moment, the electromagnetic monster charged forward and swept its tentacles at Zhou Wen and company.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to divert his attention to slash at the electromagnetic monster’s tentacles. Flashing the saber beam a few times, he snapped one of the tentacles.

When he turned his head to look at the Companion Beast, he realized that Jiuyang’s Sun God Light and Xiao’s finger forces had penetrated its body, but the Companion Beast’s body was gradually dissipating like a phantom. The three of them looked around and quickly realized that high in the sky, the Companion Beast stood atop the clouds. The wounds on its body were healing at an unbelievable speed. “We can’t give it time to heal.” Xiao took a step forward and arrived in front of the Companion Beast. Although the Companion Beast had learned his abilities, Xiao didn’t admit that he would lose to the same ability.

Furthermore, he knew this ability very well. He also knew what weaknesses it had.

Xiao moved his fingers and produced space-rupturing powers that slashed at the Companion Beast. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

However, in the next second, Xiao, Zhou Wen, and Jiuyang widened their eyes. They saw the Companion Beast’s figure move like an immortal as it drew an elegant arc and dodged Xiao’s space-rupturing powers.

It was Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal movement technique. Not only was it Transcendent Flying Immortal, but even the concept was identical.

What’s going on with this Companion Beast? Zhou Wen and company couldn’t help but feel a chill. The strength of this Companion Beast far exceeded their imagination.
