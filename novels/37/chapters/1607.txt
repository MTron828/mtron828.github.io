Chapter 1608: Attention from Everyone

Translator: CKtalon

“Immediately.” Xiao accepted the order and left the Holy Land to bring Jiuyang and Old K back.

Xiao, who had the power of the Trajectory Holy Temple, was good at spatial travel, while Jiuyang and Old K weren’t adept at such powers. After separating from each other at the Big Dipper, they didn’t immediately return.

Before Xiao left Earth, he glanced at Zhou Wen and the Void Salamander who had returned to Earth before thinking to himself, Perhaps the hooha Zhou Wen made is an opportunity.

With this in mind, Xiao used spatial teleportation to return to the Big Dipper to search for Jiuyang and Old K.

Currently, they were the only three humans in the Holy Land who could use Holy Artifacts. Although there were existences stronger than them in the Holy Land, they weren’t humans. It was impossible for them to leave the Holy Land to fight.

“Xiao, what’s wrong with you? Why did you flee without us?” Old K said angrily when he saw Xiao.

“Twas just trying to catch up to Zhou Wen. I thought I might be able to trap him again,” Xiao explained.

“So? What happened” Old K asked.

Xiao shrugged and said, “Of course I didn’t catch up. Therefore, I returned to the Holy Land and reported the situation to Lord Holy God.”

“Humph, what’s the point?” Old K snorted coldly.

“It was indeed useless, but Zhou Wen came knocking on our door,” Xiao said unhurriedly.

“What do you mean?” Old K frowned.

Xiao roughly recounted how Zhou Wen had attacked the Holy Land’s teleportation nexus with the Void Salamander. Then, he said, “Cut the crap. We don’t have time to waste. We have to quickly find Jiuyang and return to stop Zhou Wen. Otherwise, it will be very troublesome for us to enter the Holy Land if

the teleportation nexus is destroyed.”

“Of all the options available to him, he took that? I definitely won’t give him another chance again,” Old K said coldly.

“Wait for me here. I’l find Jiuyang first before returning to take you back.” As Xiao spoke, his figure flashed and vanished.

Zhou Wen once again returned to the Holy Land with the Void Salamander. The void lightning followed closely behind, leaving the teleportation nexus cracking.

The foundation of the teleportation nexus had already cracked as rubble constantly shattered amidst the lightning. The entire teleportation nexus would collapse if this continued. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Unfortunately, the Void Salamander was greatly suppressed by Earth’s rules. It could only stay on Earth for a few seconds each time. As time passed, its strength decreased drastically. The weakened void lightning couldn’t damage the foundation of the teleportation nexus.

Zhou Wen lured the Void Salamander into destroying the teleportation nexus again and again because he realized that only the Void Salamander’s void lightning could truly destroy the teleportation nexus’s comerstone.

Even the Golden Wyrm Scissors couldn’t damage the teleportation nexus.

This didn’t mean that the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ destructive power wasn’t strong. The Golden Wyrm Scissors could tear open the cornerstones, but the cornerstones would quickly recover. The cornerstones that were destroyed by the void lightning would shatter without being restored.

The power of the Void Salamander looked like lightning, but in fact, it was the power of the void at a deeper level. It wasn’t an ordinary electric current—the reason why it could destroy the foundation of the teleportation nexus.

Zhou Wen only wanted to destroy the teleportation nexus and prevent the Saints from easily coming out. In the future, it would be difficult for them to return to the Holy Land if they headed out of the Holy Land to plunder resources.

Even if there was another way out for the Holy Land, it at least allowed him to vent his anger.

“Egg Sovereign is blowing up the entrance to the Holy Land!”

“If the teleportation nexus is really destroyed, will the Saints in the Holy Land and the dimensional creatures in the Holy Temple ever come out again?”

“Egg Sovereign is heaven-defying. None of the Saints has dared to come out despite him bombarding the Holy Land’s entrance for so long.”

“The Holy Land doesn’t look as terrifying as we imagined. Look at them staying silent while Egg Sovereign does this.”

“The Void Salamander is just too powerful!”

“The Sovereign Egg hasn’t released the Tiger Soul General yet.”

Although Zhou Wen couldn’t do anything to the Holy Land, he had erased the lofty image and fear that the Holy Land had left in the hearts of humans for so many years.

“This fellow, Zhou Wen, isn’t just slapping the Holy Land in the face, but ripping its mouth apart,” Xia Liuchuan said excitedly.

“Tm just afraid that he won’t be able to leave again if he doesn’t leave now.” Zhang Chunqiu wasn’t that optimistic. He knew the power of the Holy Land.

After all, the six families had once served the Holy Land. They knew a little about the place.

“Should we do something?” Xia Liuchuan asked Zhang Chunqiu.

Zhang Chunqiu pondered for a moment and nodded. “Make some preparations. Perhaps we can help Zhou Wen at a critical moment. If Zhou Wen can really destroy the Holy Land’s teleportation nexus, it will be a boon to us.”

“What other preparations are needed? Haven’t we been making preparations all these years?” Xia Liuchuan’s eyes burned. The six families had been silent all this time, digesting the resources brought to them by the rapid changes in this world.

“Don’t do anything rash. Our present strength isn’t enough to fight the Holy Land head-on. We will only be helping Zhou Wen when necessary.” Zhang Chungqiu glared at Xia Liuchuan, peeved.

He had the best relationship with Xia Liuchuan and Dugu Ge. Among the trio, Dugu Ge was especially self-centered. He was more staid and restrained. Xia Liuchuan was the most radical. At the brink of death, he could often erupt with unimaginable potential.

However, it was also because of his personality with a propensity of doing radical things that only Zhang Chunqiu could restrain Xia Liuchuan.

“When can we fight those fellows head-on?” Xia Liuchuan said gloomily.

“When you can block the entrance of the Holy Land like Zhou Wen and have nobody daring to come out,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“I’d better make preparations.” Xia Liuchuan tured around and left.

Xia Liuchuan knew that he couldn’t block the entrance to the Holy Land. He wasn’t afraid of those Saints. He was confident that he could fight even existences like Xiao and Jiuyang.

However, those Saints had Holy Artifacts in their hands and they were inhumanly powerful.

“Stay sharp.” Xia Liuchuan gathered all the Mythical Serum experts that the Xia family had secretly nurtured in the past few years.

Typically, when people used Mythical Serums, they would use whatever Mythical Serum was most compatible with them.

However, the Xia family was different. The Xia family members would categorize different talented people and use a specific Mythical Serum. When they advanced to the Mythical stage, they wouldn’t use whatever Mythical Serum they liked, but the kind of Mythical Serum the Xia family needed.

From the looks of it, it was a huge sacrifice. Many Xia family members failed to use their talent to the best of their abilities, nor did they use the most compatible Mythical Serum.

However, when the Xia family was together, the power they erupted was far beyond what ordinary people could imagine.
