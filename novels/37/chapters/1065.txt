Chapter 1066: Jade Rabbit

Translator: CKtalon

Before leaving, Zhou Wen had asked Moon Goddess what the medicine mortar looked like, but she told him that he would identify it at a glance after leaving the osmanthus forest. It would be easy to recognize it.

Now, Zhou Wen knew why he could recognize it at a glance. The white object was clearly a huge ring-shaped mountain. Moon Goddess had actually called it a medicine mortar.

Zhou Wen knew that he wasn’t mistaken because the surrounding ring-shaped mountains were all gray. Only this one was white and looked especially striking.

According to what Zhou Wen knew, many of the ring-shaped mountains on the moon were formed from meteorites, but this white ring-shaped mountain looked somewhat special.

As the mountain wall of the ring-shaped mountain wasn’t very tall—only about two to three hundred meters—the Great Might Vajra Bull leaped up and arrived at the edge of the ring-shaped mountain, allowing him to look inside.

The mountain wall inside the ring-shaped mountain was much higher. It was probably about a thousand meters tall. The interior space was much bigger than what he saw from the outside.

If this thing is a medicine mortar, how big would the pestle have to be to match it? How big would the pill made from it be? Can humans eat it? As Zhou Wen thought, he sized up the interior of the ring-shaped mountain.

Zhou Wen didn’t find any pills or anything like that. He didn’t even see a pill-shaped stone. The interior of the ring-shaped mountain was clean as though it had been washed with water.

In a corner of the mountain, there was a huge white rabbit lying on the ground. The rabbit was surprisingly huge. If it stood up, it would probably be about the same height as Zhou Wen. Its white fur was like snow and extremely fluffy.

If it were placed in a plush toy shop, one would think that it was a large furry doll.

Is this the legendary Jade Rabbit that grinds the medicine? Zhou Wen had already learned from Moon Goddess that the one guarding the Elixir of Immortality was Jade Rabbit.

Seeing the Jade Rabbit sleeping, Zhou Wen felt that it was best not to alarm it. It was best if he could take the Elixir of Immortality while it slept.

Although Moon Goddess said that Jade Rabbit wouldn’t make things difficult for him if he had her token, Zhou Wen still felt that it was better to avoid trouble.

He put on the Invisibility Cloak and entered the ring-shaped mountain. Furthermore, he used Truth Listener to constantly scan the vicinity of the Jade Rabbit, hoping to find the legendary Elixir of Immortality.

Strange, why isn’t there any? Could it be that the Elixir of Immortality has been eaten by the Jade Rabbit? Zhou Wen felt that the possibility was very high.

After all, how could Jade Rabbit not eat such a good item after guarding it all day, every day?

Just as Zhou Wen was hesitating about waking up the Jade Rabbit, it suddenly pricked up its ears. Its ears twitched a few times before it looked up at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen hurriedly removed the Invisibility Cloak and revealed himself. At the same time, he took out the pearl and jade slip he had previously obtained. He waved them in front of the Jade Rabbit and said, “I’m here on Moon Goddess’s orders. She wants to borrow your Elixir of Immortality...”

Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, he felt that something was amiss.

The originally docile Jade Rabbit’s eyes immediately turned red when it saw the pearl and jade slip in Zhou Wen’s hand. Its fur stood on end like an enraged bull.

Holy sh*t, is this what Moon Goddess means by it won’t make things difficult for me on her account? Zhou Wen felt that he had definitely been scammed by Moon Goddess.

Just as Zhou Wen was in thought, the Jade Rabbit stood up on its hind legs and grabbed a jade pole from somewhere.

In the next second, Jade Rabbit leaped up and flew into the air like a rocket.

Zhou Wen was still puzzled as to why the fellow was jumping so high. However, he was immediately alarmed to discover that the Jade Rabbit’s body was constantly expanding in midair as it turned gigantic. Even the jade pestle in its arms was extremely huge.

Then, Zhou Wen saw the gigantic jade pestle strike at the ring-shaped mountain with the might of a mountain.

Holy sh*t! Zhou Wen saw how terrifying the might was. He was probably no match for it as he hurriedly summoned Tyrant Behemoth.

Tyrant Behemoth gigantified as it raised its claws to meet the jade pestle.

Boom!

Tyrant Behemoth’s body trembled violently as its back bent involuntarily. The rocks beneath its feet shattered.

Pfft!

Tyrant Behemoth, who was in its Absolute Strength state, spat out blood.

Boom! Boom!

Jade Rabbit struck down one pestle after another as though it was grinding medicine. In its Absolute Strength state, Tyrant Behemoth was unable to move. All it could do was passively take a beating.

It was only thanks to Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength that it wasn’t reduced to meat paste by Jade Rabbit—any other Companion Beast wouldn’t have survived.

What terrifying strength. Could this Jade Rabbit also be at the Terror grade as well? Zhou Wen saw Tyrant Behemoth spew out blood under the continuous bombardment. Seeing that it was about to collapse, Zhou Wen immediately knew that Jade Rabbit wasn’t an ordinary Mythical creature.

Without any hesitation, he summoned the Seven Seas Dragon King that had been parasitized by Primordial Spore. Although this wasn’t the sea and the Seven Seas Dragon King couldn’t use its greatest strength, a Terror grade was still worth something. Once it used its Terror form, it would be much stronger than ordinary Mythical Companion Beasts.

The moment the Seven Seas Dragon King appeared, it immediately transformed into its Terror form under Zhou Wen’s orders. Then, it spewed out a large amount of glue-like liquid. Jade Rabbit’s jade pestle struck down and smashed into the glue, immediately sticking to it.

The Jade Rabbit tried its best to pull out the jade pestle, but the glue spewing out from the Seven Seas Dragon King’s dragon head kept increasing. The stickiness also increased, preventing Jade Rabbit from pulling it out no matter how hard it tried.

Jade Rabbit hissed angrily as it exerted all its strength. However, after pulling out a portion of the jade pestle, the sticky liquid clung to it like countless white threads.

The Seven Seas Dragon King continued spewing out glue as the adhesiveness increased.

Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He knew that he was lucky. The Seven Seas Dragon King’s ability seemed to counter the Jade Rabbit.

Unable to pull out the jade pestle, Jade Rabbit immediately became anxious. It abandoned the jade pestle and struck out its front claws towards the ring-shaped mountain, hoping to tear the Seven Seas Dragon King apart.

The Seven Seas Dragon King wasn’t to be outdone. It spewed out large amounts of glue to meet Jade Rabbit’s claws.

When the Jade Rabbit’s claws touched the glue, they were immediately stuck together. When its claws reached into the ring-shaped mountain, they ended up stuck, preventing it from pulling them out.

The more it struggled, the more glue stuck to its body, making it unable to move.

The furious Jade Rabbit’s body lit up as it grew bigger and bigger. It became much bigger than Tyrant Behemoth. Soon, Tyrant Behemoth looked like a baby in front of it. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even so, the Jade Rabbit still failed to escape the glue.

Zhou Wen was overjoyed. The Jade Rabbit was clearly a pure Strength-type creature. Its Terror transformation was also purely a Strength-based transformation, so it was perfectly countered by the Seven Seas Dragon King’s ability.

“Jade Rabbit, lend me your Elixir of Immortality and I’ll let you go,” Zhou Wen said to Jade Rabbit as he stood on the Seven Seas Dragon King’s head.
