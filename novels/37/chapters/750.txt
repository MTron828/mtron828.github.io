Chapter 751: Connate Dominance Body

Translator: CKtalon

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The fully-unleashed Transcendent Flying Immortal was blocked by Old Master Xia’s hands.

The divine physique given to him by the Guardian, together with the powerful Essence Energy he had accumulated, was truly terrifying.

Zhou Wen had no intention of finishing Old Master Xia off with this strike. As the two sabers slashed crazily, Torch Dragon’s mirror eye also caused Zhou Wen’s pupils to undergo a strange change. It was as though it had turned into a mirror as it looked at Old Master Xia. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, Old Master Xia suddenly vanished into thin air. Almost at the same time, he appeared behind Zhou Wen and struck his head with his palm.

Teleportation! Zhou Wen immediately realized that it was true teleportation. It had an extremely similar effect to Lost Country.

Without any time to turn around or dodge, Zhou Wen raised Bamboo Blade above his head and blocked Old Master Xia’s palm.

However, the palm strangely turned transparent as though it had transformed into a ghostly hand. It passed through the Bamboo Blade and continued striking at Zhou Wen’s head.

Zhou Wen was alarmed as he twisted his head to the side. He gathered his strength with his other hand and struck towards Old Master Xia’s palm.

When the two palms clashed, Zhou Wen immediately felt a powerful suction force suck his palm, sucking the Essence Energy in his body towards Old Master Xia.

Zhou Wen wanted to shake off Old Master Xia’s hand, but he couldn’t. His other hand held Bamboo Blade and slashed at Old Master Xia, but he was grabbed by his other hand. His Essence Energy was sucked even faster.

Zhou Wen immediately realized the problem. Not only had Old Master Xia absorbed the Essence Energy of those geniuses, but he had also robbed them of their bloodline talent, Life Providence, and Life Soul.

Zhou Wen was certain that Old Master Xia definitely had multiple Life Providences and Life Souls. Otherwise, it was impossible for him to use so many different Essence Energy Skills.

In that short moment, Old Master Xia had used three powers of different attributes and categories. Furthermore, each of them was a rare ability.

Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy was drained as his expression turned livid. He suddenly activated his mirror eye and looked at Old Master Xia.

“Don’t use the same trick twice in front of me,” Old Master Xia said coldly. He opened his eyes and there seemed to be a devil roaring in his pupils. It was an eye-type Life Soul.

At the instant he saw the Life Soul in the eye, Zhou Wen’s eyelids closed uncontrollably. He couldn’t open them no matter what.

How many terrifying Life Providences and Life Souls did this bastard plunder? How did he do it? Zhou Wen was alarmed as the Essence Energy in his body surged towards Old Master Xia like a river.

I’ll fight it out with you. Zhou Wen struggled with all his might, hoping to escape Old Master Xia’s grasp, but it was to no avail.

Just as Old Master Xia was about to say something, a purple-black ancient sword suddenly emerged from the ground and stabbed at Old Master Xia’s crotch.

This strike was too strange and sinister. Before Old Master Xia could react, the sword had already stabbed into his body.

Bam!

After being penetrated by the demonic sword, Old Master Xia’s body exploded like a ball of water, turning into a pool of water. As for his true body, it appeared behind Zhou Wen and twisted his arms.

He even has an avatar Life Soul. This old sicko... Zhou Wen cursed inwardly.

“No matter how strong you are, you’re just a...” Before Old Master Xia could finish his sentence, his pupils constricted.

Zhou Wen’s right hand, which he had grabbed, suddenly vanished like a ghost. It passed through Old Master Xia’s Guardian armor and body and instantly flashed three times.

Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of having his Essence Energy sucked away. His Slaughterer Life Soul allowed him to have unlimited Essence Energy. No matter how much Old Master Xia absorbed, it wouldn’t harm him.

Zhou Wen had waited so long for this opportunity. When Old Master Xia believed that he was at the end of his rope and his final trump card had failed, he used Doctor Darkness’s Darkness Right Hand.

Without giving Old Master Xia any chance, Zhou Wen’s Darkness Right Hand plucked out Old Master Xia’s heart, liver, and one of his kidneys. Even the Guardian armor couldn’t block the Darkness Right Hand.

Zhou Wen held Old Master Xia’s bloody organs in his hand. The heart was still beating violently. Every time it beat, blood would spew out from the severed arteries. It looked extremely terrifying.

Old Master Xia looked down at his body and didn’t find any injuries. However, blood seeped out from his mouth and nose.

Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue watched this scene with mixed feelings.

“It’s been a long time... It’s been a long time since someone injured me... You are the first in nearly twenty years...” Old Master Xia said as he stared at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen immediately felt that something was amiss. Old Master Xia’s vitality didn’t weaken after his organs were removed. Instead, it became stronger.

A white flame burned over Old Master Xia’s body. It wasn’t a flame, but a condensation of immense lifeforce.

Zhou Wen used his penetrative vision to stare at Old Master Xia and saw that the organs that had been plucked out of his body had grown again.

“Connate Dominance Body... How is this possible... This is impossible...” Xia Xuanyue exclaimed.

“What is the Connate Dominance Body?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

The heavily injured Xia Liuchuan answered, “The Connate Dominance Body is a Life Providence derived from the Invincible Connate Divine Art. Only by cultivating the Invincible Connate Divine Art can one condense a Connate Dominance Body. However, not everyone who cultivates the Invincible Connate Divine Art can condense a Connate Dominance Body. It depends on one’s physique and talent. Our Xia family abandoned the Invincible Connate Divine Art long ago. The only person in the records who could condense a Connate Dominance Body was our Xia family’s hero... However, he died many years ago...”

Zhou Wen had heard of the Xia family’s hero. As Li Xuan cultivated in the Invincible Connate Divine Art, he had heard a lot about it from him.

However, in Zhou Wen’s impression, the Xia family’s hero’s Life Providence didn’t seem to be called the Connate Dominance Body. Furthermore, in order to get married and have children, he had nullified the Invincible Connate Divine Art. He had lost both his Life Providence and Life Soul. Even if he revived, it was impossible for him to have another Connate Dominance Body.

It was also because of this that the Xia family’s hero died in a dimensional zone.

However, Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue were real Xia family members. They naturally wouldn’t make a mistake. Old Master Xia definitely had the Connate Dominance Body.

“From the looks of it, he has absorbed a Xia family member with a Connate Dominance Body Life Providence,” Zhou Wen said.

“That’s impossible. Apart from the Xia family’s hero, even if one cultivates in the Invincible Connate Divine Art, no one has condensed a Connate Dominance Body...” Xia Xuanyue said.

“Then you must be mistaken. What he has isn’t the Connate Dominance Body, but another powerful self-healing ability...” Zhou Wen saw that Old Master Xia’s body had already recovered. After his organs were regenerated, they were no different from his previous organs.
