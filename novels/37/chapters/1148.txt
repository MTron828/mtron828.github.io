Chapter 1149: Hermit

In the medical room of the Cape family, a man stood in front of the bed. His palm emitted a faint glow as he pressed it above the wound on Buzz’s abdomen.

Buzz’s wound healed at a speed visible to the naked eye. Not only was it a physical wound, but even the wound on the Guardian armor rapidly healed. Soon, the wound completely vanished.

“Your Excellency, I’m incompetent. I’m sorry to trouble you to personally treat me.” Buzz stood up and bowed.

The man retracted his palm and said indifferently, “It’s not your fault. Ming Xiu’s sword art has indeed reached an extremely high level. Among Mythical creatures, there aren’t many who can withstand a single strike from him. This matter ends here. What happens in the future has nothing to do with you or the Cape family. Just do your job well.”

“Your Excellency... Are you going to do it yourself?” Buzz’s body trembled as he hurriedly asked.

He knew very well how terrifying this person was. Among the four heads of the League of Guardians, although Hermit’s reputation wasn’t as great as Cave Era and Blood Shaman, anyone who knew him knew that this person might be even more terrifying than the former two.

“Just do your job well,” Hermit said.

“Yes, Your Excellency.” Buzz hurriedly bowed his head in agreement.

After speaking to Hermit, he happened to meet Beryl, who had come to visit him. Beryl gave Hermit a curious glance when Buzz hurriedly pulled her aside and introduced her to him. “Your Excellency, this is my niece, Beryl.”

Hermit nodded slightly and left the hospital without looking at Beryl.

“Uncle Buzz, who is that person? You appear to be afraid of him?” Beryl asked curiously.

“Child, don’t ask. Why are you here?” Buzz hurriedly stopped before looking in the direction Hermit had left. He heaved a sigh of relief when he realized that Hermit was gone.

“Uncle Buzz, you are really heartless. I came to see you out of kindness, but you are giving me such an attitude,” Beryl said angrily.

“Alright, I surrender. I’m fine. I won’t die. Don’t worry,” Buzz said dotingly.

“That Ming Xiu is really detestable. To think that I used to worship him so much. He actually wanted to kill you. Thankfully, you’re fine,” Beryl said.

Buzz shook his head and said, “He didn’t try to kill me with that strike. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be my abdomen that was injured.”

“I see. In that case, he’s not too bad.” Beryl looked in the direction where Hermit had left. Seeing that there was no one there, she whispered, “Uncle Buzz, is that person from the League of Guardians? Seeing how afraid you are of him, he must be a high-ranking member of the League of Guardians, right?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“I told you not to ask. In the future, you can’t mention anything about the League of Guardians. Got it?” Buzz repeatedly exhorted Beryl.

Although Beryl agreed, she had something on her mind.

After leaving the hospital, Beryl found an excuse to return to school and ran straight for the lounge where Zhou Wen and company were.

The seated Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi were chatting in the lounge while Ming Xiu stood there motionless for quite some time.

Due to Tsukuyomi’s words, Ming Xiu seemed to have had an epiphany. The strength in his body was undergoing a tumultuous change.

This was an extremely dangerous moment, so Zhou Wen had no choice but to guard him and not let anyone disturb him.

Just as he was chatting with Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen suddenly sensed someone walking towards the lounge. Furthermore, the footsteps were rushed. He used Truth Listener to carefully scan the area and realized that the person was the girl they had met a few times on campus.

“Professor Ming, are you there?” Beryl came to the door and knocked anxiously.

“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen opened the door and asked.

“Leave quickly. The people from the League of Guardians want to kill Professor Ming,” Beryl immediately whispered when she saw Zhou Wen.

“Weren’t they here earlier?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Uncle Buzz only wanted to defeat Professor Ming. He definitely didn’t have the intention to kill anyone. However, the upper echelons of the League of Guardians are different. They want Professor Ming’s life. It’s best you leave quickly and quietly. Don’t let anyone discover you. I think he will take into account our Cape family and won’t attack you on campus. You have to be careful once you leave...” Before Beryl could finish her sentence, she was interrupted by an abrupt voice.

“Why would I take into account the Cape family?” Hermit’s voice made Beryl shiver. She turned her head and saw a familiar figure walking down the long corridor.

He was wearing something like a cloak. Although it didn’t completely cover his face, his face remained indiscernible.

Hermit walked over. His speed wasn’t fast, but his gait seemed to have a unique rhythm. Every step seemed to be in cadence with the beating of one’s heart, making them feel flustered as their heart raced.

Beryl took two steps back in fright as Zhou Wen pressed down on her shoulder and pulled her behind him.

“I’ve never met you before. What’s your name?” Zhou Wen asked when he found the person unfamiliar. He definitely hadn’t seen him before.

“The moment I contracted with the Guardian, my name became meaningless. The Guardian’s name is my name. You can call me Hermit,” Hermit said as he walked.

“Hermit... He’s one of the four Heavenly Kings of the League of Guardians...” Beryl exclaimed softly as her face turned pale.

There were more than four Terror-grade existences in the League of Guardians, but the four Heavenly Kings were the most terrifying. Even the members of the six families felt fear just from the mention of their names.

Beryl finally knew why Buzz had forbidden her from asking. With this person around, even if the head of the Cape family personally came, he probably wouldn’t be able to stop him from killing.

“You aren’t his match. Run...” Beryl turned around to urge Ming Xiu to escape, but she saw Ming Xiu standing there motionless as though he hadn’t heard her.

Beryl wanted to walk over, but she was stopped by Tsukuyomi.

“He can’t move now unless you want him to die,” Tsukuyomi said indifferently.

Beryl was immediately stunned. She carefully observed Ming Xiu and realized that something was amiss with him.

“Could he be breaking through?” Beryl said with a complicated expression.

“Yes,” Tsukuyomi answered affirmatively.

“What should we do? Why does it have to be at this time?” Beryl was anxious and at a loss.

“We’ll leave after he breaks through,” Tsukuyomi said.

“How can we wait until then?” Beryl didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. If they could wait, she wouldn’t be reeling with anxiety.

They could wait, but Hermit wouldn’t.

Beryl turned to look outside. To her surprise, Hermit had stopped outside the door and didn’t rush in.

“Hermit? I’ve never heard of you. What are you doing here?” When Beryl heard Zhou Wen’s words, she nearly fainted.

To her, provoking Hermit in such a manner was equivalent to him hanging himself in front of Death.
