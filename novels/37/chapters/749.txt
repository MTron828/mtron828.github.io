Chapter 750: Freakish Monster

Translator: CKtalon

While Xia Liuchuan held back Old Master Xia, Zhou Wen finally reached the top of the Hall of Supreme Harmony’s roof. When he raised the log to the highest point, Zhou Wen knew that he was at the right spot.

After the log was erected on the roof, it seemed to be sucked by a magnet. Zhou Wen didn’t need to support it to prevent it from falling.

It’s done! Zhou Wen was delighted as he took two steps back. The word “slave” didn’t appear on his forehead again.

Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to see what changes the log had undergone because Xia Liuchuan was about to be sucked dry.

Old Master Xia’s hand grabbed Xia Liuchuan’s head, causing his Essence Energy, essence, vitality, and spirit to rush into Old Master Xia’s body.

Originally, Xia Liuchuan’s life had nothing to do with Zhou Wen, but if he allowed Old Master Xia to absorb Xia Liuchuan’s powers to advance to the Mythical stage, it would be even harder to deal with him.

Furthermore, if Xia Liuchuan hadn’t held back Old Master Xia just now, it would have been very difficult for him to escape Old Master Xia and erect the log above the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

Without the restriction of the log, Zhou Wen felt much more relaxed. Doctor Darkness possessed him as he drew Bamboo Blade. He used Transcendent Flying Immortal and instantly appeared in front of Old Master Xia and slashed at his hand that was grabbing Xia Liuchuan.

Old Master Xia’s other hand blocked the Bamboo Blade at the last moment.

With the protection of the black jade armor, Bamboo Blade failed to injure his hand. However, this was within Zhou Wen’s expectations. He held the Orchid Blade in his other hand and slashed at Old Master Xia’s neck from a strange angle.

Old Master Xia had no choice but to let go of Xia Liuchuan and grab the Orchid Blade with his other hand.

Zhou Wen’s movement technique changed as he danced in the air, preventing Old Master Xia’s hand from touching his saber. With one long and one short blade in hand, he slashed at Old Master Xia from all sorts of strange angles.

He didn’t dare use his Essence Energy Skills and only relied on his strength to attack. Although the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array had been destroyed, Old Master Xia had the ability to absorb all sorts of Essence Energy. Even an Essence Energy Skill with powerful offensive strength like the Golden Sword Aura would be directly absorbed by him and augment him. The other Essence Energy Skills were even more useless.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen was best at movement techniques. He didn’t need to release his Essence Energy, or he would have been sucked in by Old Master Xia.

Outside Forbidden City, Zhang Chunqiu and Dugu Ge were already dumbfounded. With the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array enveloping the area, they had no idea what was happening inside.

After the array was destroyed by Zhou Wen, they could finally see the situation inside.

However, they ended up seeing that Xia Liuchuan had been beaten up by Old Master Xia and how Zhou Wen had helped to resolve the situation and was fighting Old Master Xia. In addition, more than ten thousand Xia family members had collapsed to the ground. It left them momentarily shocked, unsure of what had happened.

Zhou Wen pushed Transcendent Flying Immortal to its limits. With Doctor Darkness strengthening his body, his speed was much faster than a Mythical creature like Six-Winged.

However, his two sabers did not touch Old Master Xia at all.

Path to Snatching Heaven! Zhou Wen recognized that the movement technique Old Master Xia was using was the Path to Snatching Heaven.

Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange that Old Master Xia could use Path to Snatching Heaven. Furthermore, Old Master Xia’s Path to Snatching Heaven was stronger than Xia Xuanyue’s. Clearly, he had long cultivated it to the divine level.

However, this movement technique was somewhat different from Xia Xuanyue’s—it was several times stronger. Even Zhou Wen’s divine Transcendent Flying Immortal paled in comparison.

What was even more terrifying was that not only did Old Master Xia have a good movement technique, but he seemed to have made terrifying achievements in his various techniques. Every ordinary move was like a finishing touch. It was as if every move had reached a divine level.

Zhou Wen was completely suppressed in a short period of time. Be it in terms of technique or strength, he was unable to fight Old Master Xia head-on.

If not for the fact that he already knew the profundity of the Path to Snatching Heaven, he would have been injured by Old Master Xia.

With his understanding of Path to Snatching Heaven and the wonders of Transcendent Flying Immortal, Zhou Wen was barely able to maintain an undefeated stance.

This sicko is a monster. How can someone cultivate all the techniques to the divine level? Is he still human? Zhou Wen knew very well how difficult it was to cultivate a technique to the divine level.

After cultivating for so long, he had only cultivated Transcendent Flying Immortal to the divine level. Xia Liuchuan was about ten years older than him, but he had also only cultivated Sword Warp to the divine level.

As for Old Master Xia, he gave Zhou Wen the feeling that he was omnipotent. It was as though any technique would become an unparalleled divine technique in his hands.

Although he didn’t use any Essence Energy Skills, he was already suffocating from the pressure.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen was a person who was calmer and less prone to mistakes in times of adversity. He kept searching for an opportunity to defeat Old Master Xia.

Typical Companion Beast attacks weren’t of much use against someone like Old Master Xia who could absorb Essence Energy Skills. Physical attacks were relatively effective against him.

However, now that he had the Guardian armor, he was like a tiger with wings. Typical Mythical Companion Beasts were probably not a threat to him.

Tyrant Behemoth was originally a better choice. Unfortunately, its Absolute Strength had run out not long ago, so it couldn’t be used for the time being.

After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that among his Companion Beasts, the only ones that might pose a threat to Old Master Xia were Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World, Demonic Neonate’s Demonic Sword, and Truth Listener that had activated multiple earrings.

However, they might only be effective and not necessarily useful. Therefore, Zhou Wen had to find an appropriate opportunity to use Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch World. He only hoped to kill Old Master Xia in one strike and not give him any chance.

His flesh tore as Old Master Xia’s fingertip brushed past Zhou Wen’s arm. Immediately, his flesh was sliced open and blood flowed out. If Zhou Wen had dodged any slower, his arm would have been severed.

To fight someone whose movement techniques weren’t slower than them, whose attacks were more ruthless than them, and whose moves were more ingenious than them, anyone would feel immense pressure. If they weren’t careful, they might be killed in one strike.

In reality, there was no rewind option like in-game, so Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless. He would rather be injured than take the risk of being killed in one strike.

“You are indeed different from the rest. I wouldn’t be surprised if I saw such a movement technique and endurance from an old man in his seventies or eighties, but you are only seventeen or eighteen years old. To be able to do this much, your future achievements will definitely not be inferior to An Tianzuo’s if you don’t die,” Old Master Xia said calmly as he attacked.

Actually, he shouldn’t be called Old Master Xia anymore because his current appearance was almost the same as a man in his thirties. There were no signs of aging on his body.

His majestic figure, domineering aura, and invincible combat strength made him seem invulnerable.

Blood splattered as another wound appeared on Zhou Wen’s back.

“I’ll help you.” Xia Liuchuan struggled to stand up, but his injuries were too serious. He staggered as he walked. Only his hand that held the sword remained steady.

Xia Liuchuan wanted to throw his sword at Old Master Xia, but before he could do so, Old Master Xia had already struck out with his palm, sending Xia Liuchuan flying along with his sword.

Now. Zhou Wen instantly unleashed his strength. He pushed Transcendent Flying Immortal to its limits as the two blades transformed into streams of light that criss-crossed with Old Master Xia.
