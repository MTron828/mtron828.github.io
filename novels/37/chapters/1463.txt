Chapter 1464 Rainstorm Cleansing

Zhou Wen’s long-distance teleportation still had some level of deviations. He teleported to a spot about fifteen kilometers away from Guide Ancient City.

There were a large number of skeleton soldiers wandering around. Dozens of them rushed over when they saw Zhou Wen appear. Zhou Wen waved his hand and killed all the nearby skeleton soldiers before quickly instant transmitting. However, he wasn’t instant transmitting in the direction of Guide Ancient City, but his alma mater, Guide High School.

With so many skeleton soldiers appearing, it meant that the situation in Guide City was probably terrible. Compared to the stone saber, he was more worried about Yu Qiubai’s safety.

After the former principal left, Yu Qiubai had taken good care of him. If not for Yu Qiubai’s introduction, he wouldn’t have known Li Xuan.

Although Ouyang Lan would definitely let him enter Sunset College even if he didn’t team up with Li Xuan, that wasn’t what Zhou Wen wanted. He wanted to enter through his own efforts. Otherwise, he would rather not be enrolled.

According to what Zhou Wen knew, Yu Qiubai lived in the school’s staff dormitory. He had a wife, but he didn’t have any children. If he hadn’t moved out, he could be found the moment Zhou Wen returned to school.

With Zhou Wen’s speed, it only took him the blink of an eye to travel twenty to thirty kilometers. When he arrived at Guide High School, he saw that it had turned into a battlefield. Soldiers were fighting Skeleton Soldiers on the streets.

With the school as the base, the soldiers and the teachers were fighting waves of Skeleton Soldiers and Skeleton Generals.

There were hordes of Skeleton Soldiers everywhere on the streets. There were also quite a number of Skeleton Generals. There were even some Skeleton Generals that were emitting flames. They were all Epic existences.

The school’s defense line was retreating in defeat and could collapse at any moment.

Zhou Wen saw Yu Qiubai at a glance. Yu Qiubai was only at the Epic stage, but now, he was riding on a wild goose and shooting arrows from midair. He was engaged in a battle with a blood-colored caped and blood-stained armor-wearing general riding a skeleton horse.

Although it was called a battle, Yu Qiubai was only trying to attract the general’s attention and prevent him from rushing towards the school. The general had already reached the Mythical stage. This was only a high school. Among the teachers and reinforcing soldiers, there was no one who could match him. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The general raised the spear in his hand into the sky as the blood flames tore through the air. Yu Qiubai had to use all his might to dodge the attack.

Yu Qiubai was already injured in several spots. The wild goose beneath him had also been injured, making the battle extremely strenuous. As he attracted the general’s attention, he shouted, “Run… Take the back door…”

The students on campus retreated from the back door under the cover of the soldiers. However, although there weren’t any Mythical generals at the back door, there were still hordes of skeletons. Most of the soldiers and teachers were fighting at the main entrance. Only a small number of soldiers were here. After a few attempts, they failed to charge out.

Many timid girls were already crying. Many of the men were on the brink of collapse. The soldiers also knew that under such circumstances, it was only a matter of time before the defense line was breached. If there were no reinforcements, probably no one here could escape alive.

However, there were skeleton creatures everywhere in Guide City. Reinforcements were needed everywhere. Who could spare their forces to help them?

“Old Wu, lead Bravo Team to the back door and forge a path. Help those students rush out and lead them to the administrative area in the east.”

“Captain, we can’t hold on any longer. If we leave, are we going to give up on this defense line?” Old Wu, who was covered in blood, shouted as he killed.

“The defense line will be breached sooner or later. When the time comes, we will all die. Let’s hold on for a while. Escape with them and forge a way out. Every life saved is an achievement in itself.” The captain’s Essence Gold bullets had been used up. He held his Companion Beast saber and slashed with all his might. “If we leave, you are all dead!” Old Wu refused to retreat. “If you don’t leave, all of us will be dead. Go. This is an order. Take those students east. They should be able to last for a while longer. As long as we can last until the reinforcements arrive, a few of us will survive…” “I’m not leaving. If we die, we die together. Death is only a matter of time. Wait for reinforcements? My ass! Who around Guide City can reinforce us?” Old Wu continued fighting with all his might as he roared.

The captain still wanted to say something, but after opening his blood-stained lips, he ultimately held his tongue.

In the nearby area, the strongest military force was in Guide City. Now that Guide City couldn’t even fend for itself, who could reinforce them?

The only exception was the Sunset Army’s reinforcements. However, Luoyang was too far from Guide City. They wouldn’t be able to last long enough for the Sunset Army to arrive.

“Captain, I heard that there was a famous general in Guide City, Zhang Xun, who defended the city without retreating. He defended the city without any rations internally or any reinforcements externally. With hundreds of soldiers, he held off tens of thousands of rebel soldiers outside the city and fought more than four hundred bloody battles without being defeated. He managed to defend half of the Great Tang dynasty. Although we don’t have Zhang Xun’s abilities, to be able to die in battle on the same land as him, we might not be considered heroes, but we can be considered as people following in the footsteps of heroes, right?” Old Wu shouted as he continued killing.

The captain gave a wry smile and said, “If it’s possible, I’d rather you not be that hero.”

“So what if we die? Who doesn’t die? We brothers will have company in our eternal peace. We won’t be lonely on the way…” As Old Wu spoke, he saw the defense line breach. A tide of skeletons surged into the school.

“It’s over!” The soldiers and teachers looked at the skeleton legion that charged in like predators. They knew that the situation was hopeless, and their eyes were filled with despair. Yu Qiubai sighed and looked into the school. Not only were his students there, but his wife was also there.

Hum!

Suddenly, a strange buzzing sound sounded in the air. It was as though countless bees were flapping their wings and flying, but no one saw them.

Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!

The horde of skeletons that rushed into the school was instantly shattered by an invisible force that descended from the sky. Large swaths of them were instantly diced into fragments.

It wasn’t just the school. The tidal-like skeletons outside were also diced to pieces by the power that descended from the sky. Be it the lowest-level Skeleton Soldiers or the flaming Skeleton Generals, none of them could withstand a single strike.

It was as though an invisible sword rain had enveloped the entire land, instantly destroying all the skeletons as though it was purging the land.

“What happened?” Everyone watched in a daze as the waves of skeletons were killed. Even the seemingly invincible Mythical skeleton general failed to withstand the invisible force. His body was sliced into pieces by the invisible sword beams that descended from the sky.

Everyone looked into the sky and saw a figure levitating there. His clothes and black hair fluttered in the wind. He was the one who had released the invisible sword beams that purged the land like a storm.

“Zhou Wen.” Yu Qiubai couldn’t help but feel pleasantly surprised when he saw the figure.

“Sir, I’m sorry for being late,” Zhou Wen said in embarrassment when he arrived in front of Yu Qiubai. All the skeletons within his reach had been killed. The distant skeleton legion had yet to charge over.
