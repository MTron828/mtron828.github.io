Chapter 1108: Humans Don’t Fight With The Heavens

Translator: CKtalon

Finish him! Zhou Wen could only secretly pray that Truth Listener could kill Di Tian. Otherwise, he really didn’t have the strength to fight Di Tian.

In fact, even Zhou Wen had never expected Truth Listener to reach the level of a Calamity. This was already a pleasant surprise.

However, Truth Listener had completely severed its connection with him after reaching the Calamity grade. It was probably impossible to regain ownership of it. Zhou Wen couldn’t tell if it was a blessing or a curse.

If Truth Listener defeated Di Tian, would it count as him winning this battle? Or would Truth Listener kill him, its former owner?

Looking at the ruthless Truth Listener that resembled a devil from hell, Zhou Wen felt that the possibility was very high.

The entire power of hell seemed to lunge at Di Tian with Truth Listener. A look of surprise flashed in Di Tian’s eyes, but he didn’t show any intention of retreating. He slowly extended his palm to suppress it.

With the movement of his palm, the sky was filled with gods and Buddhas. They flew around him as though Heaven had descended from the sky.

The spectators were dumbfounded. What they saw was hell rising and the heaven descending. At the moment of this pandemonic collision, countless terrifying phenomena emerged.

If this scene hadn’t happened in the cube’s arena but on Earth, a huge city would have been destroyed by this strike.

“Is this the power of a Calamity-grade entity?” Everyone felt their hearts tremble. A single strike was enough to destroy the world. Gods, Buddhas, and ferocious beasts wreaked havoc everywhere. It was like hell on earth.

They didn’t dare imagine how many people would die if such a force erupted in human settlements. Even Mythical experts would probably die.

“No good!” Li Xuan exclaimed. This was because he saw the power of hell descending, and the power of the heaven constantly suppressing it.

Zhou Wen also knew that things weren’t good. Others couldn’t see the clash between Truth Listener and Di Tian, but Zhou Wen’s Wheel of Destiny allowed him to see some of it, especially when Truth Listener and Di Tian were motionless.

Di Tian’s palm pressed down on Truth Listener’s dark-gold claws, forcefully suppressing it. Truth Listener’s huge body was about to be pressed down into the arena.

Boom!

In the next second, Truth Listener’s body had already landed on the arena. It propped its feet on the ground and used its claws to resist Di Tian’s palm, but its back was bent from the suppression.

The hellish scene was almost completely shattered by the scene of heaven. Truth Listener and Di Tian’s figures appeared.

Upon seeing Truth Listener being suppressed by a single hand of Di Tian, its body slowly arching as it started to kneel on the ground, everyone was shocked.

Such a powerful Companion Beast was actually suppressed by Di Tian to the point of being unable to stand. What powerful strength was this?

They didn’t know that as the leader of the Octokind, Di Tian was a top-notch existence among the Calamity grade entities. Although Truth Listener had entered the Calamity grade, its method of entering the Calamity grade had actually been through a trick. It could only be considered as having just entered the Calamity grade, so there was still a gap between it and Di Tian.

“It’s over. Even such a powerful Companion Beast can’t fight dimensional creatures. Dimensional creatures are just too powerful.” Someone sighed, but most people were silent.

Di Tian’s strength and invincibility had already been deeply imprinted in the minds of every human. It made them feel an indescribable sense of powerlessness. They felt as if their strength had been sucked away.

It wasn’t that they really didn’t have any strength left. It was just that they were suffering from too much despair in their hearts. The mental blow was too great and they were too disappointed.

So what if they could nurture Companion Beasts to be as powerful as Human’s Companion Beasts? They would still be suppressed by dimensional creatures with one hand.

Humans weren’t afraid of difficulties, but they were afraid of not seeing hope. And Di Tian’s strength had already made many people despair.

Even if humans rely on external forces, they are far from being able to fight dimensional creatures. This thought was buried deep in their hearts.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time for such wistful thoughts. This was because he knew that Truth Listener’s defeat meant that he would die. It would be impossible for Di Tian to spare him.

What should I do? How can I turn the tables? Countless plans flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind, but he rejected them all.

No matter how powerful a technique was, it was useless in front of absolute strength. Zhou Wen couldn’t think of any strength he had that could match Di Tian.

Sigh of the King? Zhou Wen finally thought of his strange Life Providence.

However, ever since he had forcefully reversed the Wheel of Destiny, the Sigh of the King had had no reaction at all. Perhaps it was completely disappointed in him so it no longer gave him any feedback.

Zhou Wen kept trying, but the Sigh of the King didn’t stir.

What a pity. Truth Listener’s evolution was too fast. If it had been a little slower, it might still have had a chance. In a cave at the foot of Chess Mountain, there was an extremely beautiful woman chained up. The woman looked at the phone screen in front of her and sighed. I originally thought that I could find someone compatible with me to escape, but who knew that it would be such a suicidal fellow. From the looks of it, I can only continue searching for others. I wonder how long I’ll have to wait.

Even a powerhouse like The Thearch believed that Zhou Wen no longer had a chance.

A battle between Calamity-grade creatures wasn’t something ordinary creatures could participate in. Unless Zhou Wen had a second Calamity Companion Beast, the outcome was set.

What a pity. Jing Daoxian, who was in the ancient temple, also sighed. However, it was unknown if he felt pity for Truth Listener or Zhou Wen.

Wang Lu, Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, Wei Ge, and company had their hearts in their throats. They knew that Truth Listener’s defeat would spell Zhou Wen’s death, but no one had the ability to help him. All they could do was watch helplessly and pray for a miracle. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

God, help him. At the very least, let him live. Wang Lu could only pray for God’s help. However, her level was too low. Even with the augmentation of her Life Providence, the effects were minute.

Boom!

One of Truth Listener’s legs touched the ground as it half-knelt. It roared angrily as dark golden blood seeped out of its seven orifices. Its entire body exerted all its strength, but it was unable to stand up under the huge hand. Furthermore, it was constantly bending under the pressure.

Crack!

Truth Listener’s other leg supported its body by pressing against the ground as it refused to yield. However, it was snapped by the terrifying pressure, revealing its broken bones.

Truth Listener’s ferocious nature erupted as it crazily unleashed its strength, but it was useless. Only blood flowed out from its fracture, dyeing the arena red.

“Humans don’t fight with the heavens. Slaves don’t fight with the master. This is the law of the world. It’s also destined. This is the consequence of going against the will of the heavens.” Di Tian’s voice was like divine thunder that spread to every corner of the world.

Anger, indignation, helplessness, sorrow, despair, and other emotions spread in everyone’s hearts, but there was nothing they could do.

Di Tian stood there with the vantage of a god and looked down on all human beings. Even if there was any indignation, they were powerless to knock that god off his pedestal. At this moment, saying anything was just inviting insults
