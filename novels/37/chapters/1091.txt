Chapter 1092: Grim Demon’s Stand

Translator: CKtalon

Grim Demon knew that it was time for him to choose a side, but he didn’t feel too conflicted. He chose to stand on Zhou Wen’s side.

Guardians weren’t pure dimensional creatures. They were just tools created by dimensional creatures. He had no feelings for them.

Of course, this wasn’t the reason he chose Zhou Wen. It was mainly because Demonic Neonate was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast. Demonic Neonate was definitely on Zhou Wen’s side, so Grim Demon had no choice. He would choose whichever side Demonic Neonate stood.

It wasn’t difficult to choose a side. The difficult part was how to make the stand.

Grim Demon knew that Zhou Wen didn’t trust him, and Demonic Neonate listened to Zhou Wen. Therefore, Grim Demon felt that this was a very good opportunity. If he did well and obtained Zhou Wen’s trust, he might be able to escape the awkward position of being “reserve rations.”

Grim Demon gritted his teeth and made up his mind. He looked at Zhou Wen and walked over.

Everyone looked forward to the beginning of the battle as their gazes focused on Grim Demon. Now, they only hoped that Grim Demon and Human wouldn’t just disappear again.

Grim Demon didn’t vanish; instead, he slowly walked in front of Zhou Wen. Then, under everyone’s incredulous gazes, he genuflected like a knight and pressed his right hand to his heart. He said to Zhou Wen, “I swear upon my name as Grim Demon that I’m willing to sign a master-slave contract with you and pledge eternal loyalty to you until death...”

The entire world fell dead silent. People couldn’t believe their eyes and ears.

Guardians were Guardians. How honorable and powerful were they? Without exception, the humans who had Guardians had to work extremely hard to obtain the Guardian’s recognition before they had a chance to sign a contract with them.

There were even many people who were willing to pay the price of their lives to contract a Guardian.

It could be said that although the Guardian contract was an equal contract, humans were actually the weaker party in the contract. They were the ones being chosen.

As for the Guardians, their strength paled in comparison to Grim Demon’s. They were much weaker.

Such a powerful Grim Demon had actually taken the initiative to request a contract with the person in front of him. Furthermore, he had requested to sign a master-slave contract. This was completely unheard of.

“Guardians can also sign a master-slave contract?”

“Wait, Grim Demon wants to sign a contract with that person. In other words, that person definitely hasn’t contracted a Guardian.”

A human who has fused with a Guardian can still contract with another Guardian? If it’s not possible, could this person be a pure human?

“That’s impossible. Pure humans are unable to advance to the Mythical stage, so it’s impossible for them to activate the cube to enter the ranking battle.”

“Who is this person? He’s only wearing a mask. Does anyone recognize him?”

It wasn’t just the average person. Even the veteran experts of the six families were shocked. They had never seen such a thing before.

“Old Qiu, can you tell who this person is?” Xia Liuchuan asked.

“I can’t tell. There’s some kind of power that has changed his build. This build isn’t his original build,” Zhang Chunqiu answered.

Messages kept being exchanged overseas. They hoped to find out Human’s true identity.

Zhou Wen looked at Grim Demon with an odd expression. He could roughly guess Grim Demon’s thoughts.

Seeing that Zhou Wen wasn’t saying a word, Grim Demon had no choice but to maintain the stance of a knight taking an oath. He kept consoling himself inwardly. I’ll put on a show. For Her Lady Demonic Neonate, I’ll tolerate it.

Zhou Wen waved his hand, gesturing for Grim Demon to leave. He wasn’t in the mood to put on an act. All he wanted to do now was kill Guardians, but he took note of Grim Demon’s intentions.

Grim Demon hurriedly got up and admitted defeat before leaving the cube’s arena.

“Holy sh*t, he doesn’t want a Guardian who came knocking on his door?”

“That’s Grim Demon—a top Guardian. He rejected him just like that?”

“Boss, if you don’t want him, give him to me. I want him.”

“This world must be crazy. Such a powerful Guardian took the initiative to request a master-slave contract, but he actually rejected it.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Is Grim Demon that dim? He didn’t even attack despite the embarrassment he suffered from Human. He even obediently admitted defeat. Isn’t this too ridiculous?”

“I think Grim Demon knows how powerful Human is, so he took the initiative to request a master-slave contract. Furthermore, he didn’t dare turn hostile.”

“Never compare with others. They only serve to infuriate!”

It wasn’t just Earth. The dimensional creatures watching this battle were also dumbfounded.

Grim Demon was a Guardian. Many dimensional creatures who had experienced the war on Earth in ancient times knew of him. He was also one of the top Guardians back then.

Grim Demon’s actions were just too strange to them. It even made them suspect if Grim Demon was fake.

Soon, the various dimensional races ordered their Guardians on Earth to test Human and figure out what kind of existence Human was.

Due to the restrictions of the rules on Earth, no matter how powerful the dimensional races were, they would be punished by the rules if they personally descended. At most, they would maintain their standards at the Terror grade. They might even drop to the Mythical stage.

They couldn’t personally test Zhou Wen either, so they could only observe him through the cube. The information they could obtain was very limited.

Before Zhou Wen went on stage, he had already thought it through. He had already drawn the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Heaven-Opening on his Wheel of Destiny. Furthermore, he constantly engraved it. Even if the engravings vanished, the subsequent engravings would be replenished, allowing him to maintain an active state of Heaven-Opening Scripture.

To others, this would expend a large amount of mental strength and Essence Energy, but to Zhou Wen, this expenditure was nothing.

Now, he only wanted to know if the Heaven-Opening Scripture, which could break through the various dimensional zones’ taboo laws, could withstand the cube’s laws.

If he couldn’t withstand it and the dimensional creatures could kick him out like they had kicked Ya away, there would be zero chance. As long as they couldn’t kick him out, he definitely wouldn’t let any Guardian get first place.

However, Zhou Wen knew that dimensional creatures wouldn’t use the cube’s rules to kick him out immediately.

From the various actions of the dimensional creatures and the information he had obtained from Ice Maiden, he could tell that there were many races in the dimension. They restrained each other and often launched racial wars.

The cube wasn’t something a single race could control. After all, the victor of the cube would allow a race to obtain control of Earth. It was impossible for the rest of the dimension to allow a race to completely control the cube.

It wasn’t an easy task to obtain the approval of all the figures in power and use the rules to kick him out. Even if all the big shots could reach a consensus, it would definitely take some time. Otherwise, the fellows from the dimension wouldn’t have gone through all the various troublesome methods to deal with Ya.
