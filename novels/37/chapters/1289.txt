Chapter 1290: Based on Honesty and Integrity

“Looter King? What’s he doing here? Doesn’t he only like to pick up scraps? Is there anything for him to loot here?”

“Didn’t you hear him say that he wants to be a fighter substitute?”

“Fighter substitute? How does that work? Who is he substituting? Fight the League of Guardians in place of the Holy Spirit Association?”

“Is he crazy? He actually wants to take advantage of such a situation? Isn’t he afraid that he won’t have the life to spend the money he earns? Ignoring the fact that he can fight the terrifying, godlike Immortal, even if he can, will he have a peaceful life after offending the League of Guardians?”

“So what if it’s the League of Guardians? If even Immortal is defeated, who in the League of Guardians can touch him? They will only be throwing themselves at death.”

…

The person who appeared on Venus was naturally Zhou Wen. However, he didn’t wish to participate in the battle between the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association with his personal identity to prevent the League of Guardians from targeting his family. Although he wasn’t afraid, it would be very troublesome. It was better to save the trouble.

Zhou Wen appeared in the middle of Immortal and Ya, seemingly both unintentionally and intentionally. It made the battle that was about to break out between them calm down slightly as the auras on both sides converged.

“Looter King, are you also a member of the Holy Spirit Association?” Immortal said with a frown.

Back when Zhou Wen used his sword to block the seventh Calamity-grade bullet, even Immortal didn’t dare belittle him.

“Of course not. I’ve always been a loner. I never share my earnings with others, so how can I join an organization to split the money with others? Now that I’m providing fighter substitute services, I wonder if you are interested in my services. My prices begin at a Mythical Companion Egg,” Zhou Wen said, having changed his voice.

Immortal didn’t say a word as he looked at Zhou Wen. He was already confident of victory, so he naturally didn’t need Zhou Wen to fight on his behalf. However, if he said that he didn’t need him, the Holy Spirit Association, which was in a very disadvantageous situation, would definitely need such a strong ally.

The problem was that Immortal didn’t know the origins of Looter King. Perhaps he was a member of the Holy Spirit Association and was only pretending.

“It’s fine. Think about it carefully.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he looked at Zhong Ziya and asked, “President, do you need a fighter substitute service? The price is fair and honest.”

“What’s the price?” Zhong Ziya didn’t retract his sword as he asked coldly.

“That depends on who you want me to fight,” Zhou Wen said.

“That irritating fellow opposite me,” Zhong Ziya said.

“That’s a major figure from the League of Guardians. He’s very powerful,” Zhou Wen said, seemingly afraid.

“You don’t dare to accept the job?” Zhong Ziya asked again.

“I’ll accept it as long as I’m paid, but the price definitely won’t be cheap,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Name your price,” Zhong Ziya said again.

“I just started business today. I’ll give you a reasonable price, so don’t haggle. A Terror-grade Companion Egg. Service is rendered after payment,” Zhou Wen said.

“Deal.” Zhong Ziya extended his hand and threw a Companion Egg at Zhou Wen. “Terror-grade Flaming Monarch, you can check the goods first.”

“There’s no need. I trust the president of the Holy Spirit Association.” Zhou Wen caught the Companion Egg and stroked it lovingly.

“Now that you’ve taken my Companion Egg, it’s time to work,” Zhong Ziya said.

“No rush.” Zhou Wen held the Companion Egg and turned to Immortal. “Lord Immortal, as you can see, President Ya spent a Terror-grade Companion Egg to get me to fight for him. If you think the price of a Companion Egg is too low, you can offer a higher price. I’ll help you beat him up.”

“F*ck, he’s too shameless. This fellow actually raised the price so brazenly.”

“What do you mean by raising the price? This is called extortion, alright?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Looter King is too shameless. He doesn’t have any professional ethics.”

“There are benefits to being shameless. Look at him. He has already obtained a Terror-grade Companion Egg. At the very least, he can earn a Terror-grade Companion Egg. I’m afraid we won’t have the chance to encounter such a high-grade item in our lives. He earned it with just a few words. I call that skill.”

“Although he’s capable, he’s really too shameless.”

As people discussed, Immortal looked at Zhou Wen and said without any fluctuations in his voice, “How do I know that you will definitely work for me after taking my payment?”

“I’ll do the work for whoever gives me the most benefits. However, don’t worry. I have my professional ethics. As long as I receive benefits, I’ll definitely do the work. If I can’t do it, I’ll refund it in full. I guarantee it with my reputation. Otherwise, I’ll be struck by lightning and die without a complete corpse…” Zhou Wen swore as though he was serious.

“I don’t have a Terror-grade Companion Egg. There’s a Terror-grade skill crystal here. It’s produced by a spatial creature, Void Bird. It’s definitely a spatial skill. Its value is above the Flaming Monarch,” Immortal said as he took out a skill crystal.

When people heard the name Void Bird, they were immediately taken aback.

Void Bird came from overseas. It was said to be a bird that never landed on the ground. It soared above the sea all its life. Furthermore, it was said that Void Bird had the ability to travel to the future. Wherever it appeared, there was a high possibility of a huge storm happening the next day. Therefore, Void Bird was known as the Bird of Prophecy or the Bird of Calamity.

Although there were also people who wanted to hunt the Void Bird, it was a top-notch spatial creature. Its ability to traverse space was extremely strong. Several bigwigs overseas ultimately failed at capturing the Void Bird.

Since Immortal had produced a skill crystal of the Void Bird, it naturally meant that he had killed one.

“It’s good stuff, but it’s only at the same level after all. The Flaming Monarch Companion Egg isn’t much worse. Why don’t you top it up a little more?” Zhou Wen said.

“Take it if you want it. If not, do the work,” Immortal said calmly.

“Alright, I’ll take this job. Services are rendered after payment,” Zhou Wen said.

Immortal expressionlessly threw the skill crystal to Zhou Wen and looked coldly at him to see what he was up to.

Zhou Wen caught the crystal and stroked it twice before putting it away. He looked at Immortal and asked, “Lord Immortal, don’t worry. Now that I’ve taken payment, I’ll definitely help you settle the matter. I’ll definitely beat him to the ground and make him unable to get up. What do you think?”

“Good,” Immortal answered.

After receiving an affirmative answer, Zhou Wen turned to Zhong Ziya and said, “President Ya, you heard it too. The other party’s price is higher than yours. Why don’t you raise it?”

“I’m not gonna top up. Return the Companion Egg to me,” Zhong Ziya said as he extended his hand.

Zhou Wen instantly put away the Flaming Monarch Companion Egg and said with a smile, “How can I return it to you after closing the deal?”

“What do you mean?” Zhong Ziya frowned.

It wasn’t only Zhong Ziya. Everyone was stunned, unsure what Zhou Wen was up to.

Zhou Wen continued with a smile, “After receiving your benefits, I’ll naturally help you beat up that Lord Immortal. However, I’ve also received something good from Lord Immortal. Furthermore, the benefits he gives me are better than yours, so I must beat you up first. After I’m done beating you up, I’ll beat him up. It doesn’t matter. I’m a person who values integrity the most. I’m based on honesty and integrity. I guarantee satisfaction to all my employers for all closed transactions.”

Everyone’s jaws dropped. They were stunned for a long time.
