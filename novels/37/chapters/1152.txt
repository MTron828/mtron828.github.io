Chapter 1153: Battling the Planet Devourer Again

Their gazes met in the air as though sparks were flying.

“Young Master Wen, you’re back.” An Sheng came in at the right time, interrupting Tsukuyomi and Ya’er’s staring showdown. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Ah Sheng.” Zhou Wen was overjoyed. On the one hand, it was a long-awaited reunion, but on the other hand, he was grateful for An Sheng’s timely arrival. If they were to really fight, Zhou Wen was afraid that Luoyang would be reduced to ruins.

He got An Sheng to sit down and have a chat, but Zhou Wen didn’t ask about the fake Zhou Wen. An Sheng didn’t say anything about him either. All he did was talk about his family.

At night, just before Zhou Wen went to sleep, he found a bookshelf in his room. Zhou Wen pulled out a book to take a look. It recorded a lot of information that Zhou Wen wanted to know. An Sheng had secretly sent him a message about the book.

After some reading, Zhou Wen roughly knew why the An family had a fake Zhou Wen.

After Zhou Wen had been imprisoned, Wang Mingyuan secretly visited the An family and told them that Zhou Wen would go missing for five years. He got them to create a fake Zhou Wen in these five years to replace Zhou Wen. They were not to let others discover any flaws.

However, there were no records of the person impersonating Zhou Wen.

How did Teacher know that I would escape in five years?

Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. This was because his awakening and escape seemed to be a coincidence, but the time was identical to Wang Mingyuan’s inference. This made Zhou Wen suspect if his escape was a coincidence.

However, Wang Mingyuan was now in the dimension, so his guesses were useless.

The book contained information on another thing that Zhou Wen wanted to know. Ouyang Lan had been investigating the former principal’s expedition team for the past five years.

She had made some discoveries some time ago and Ouyang Lan had already rushed to Netherworld City. She wanted to find Chu He, who was trapped there. She wanted to confirm some of her guesses.

If those guesses were confirmed, the disappearance of the expedition team was very likely related to the Trajectory Holy Temple of the six Holy Temples.

Zhou Wen was shocked when he found out that Ouyang Lan had gone to Netherworld City.

Ignoring the fact that there were break-out dimensional creatures everywhere outside, Netherworld City itself was an extremely terrifying place. It wasn’t easy to enter and come out alive.

“I’ve told you about the situation in Netherworld City. You should know how dangerous it is. Why didn’t you stop Sis Lan?” Zhou Wen sent a message to An Sheng.

Soon, An Sheng replied: “You know Madam’s temper. Even Overseer couldn’t change her mind. However, you don’t have to worry too much. Overseer sent many experts from the Sunset Army to accompany her. If Netherworld City were to be explored, Madam wouldn’t be the one entering personally. With the information you gave, there shouldn’t be much danger.”

“I’m just afraid that the present Netherworld City is different from the past.” Zhou Wen knew that Netherworld City wasn’t simple. If he could suffer all the punishments, he would be able to see the real Netherworld City.

“What do you mean?” An Sheng asked in puzzlement.

Zhou Wen told An Sheng what City Lord Netherworld had said. An Sheng heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that. “Don’t worry. No one among them can withstand all the punishments. Nothing will happen.”

An Sheng explained the current situation of the Federation to Zhou Wen. It was similar to what Zhou Wen had previously gathered. Earth could now be divided into five factions.

The Federation President and some of his supporters, the League of Guardians, the Holy Spirit Association, the overseas factions, and the local wealthy families like the An family.

There were also some powerful freelance hunters, among which some were very powerful existences. However, compared to these large factions, an individual’s strength was still relatively weak.

The six hero families didn’t decline, nor were they completely controlled by the League of Guardians. Their branches extended into the various factions. Even if one side collapsed, the six hero families wouldn’t be completely destroyed.

In fact, there were many members of the six families in the League of Guardians. Although the Zhang family nominally objected to their family members entering the League of Guardians, there were still some Zhang family members who joined the League of Guardians. No one knew if those people had really been expelled from the Zhang family.

“This is the foundation of a large family. As long as their model for survival isn’t destroyed, as long as the supply chain for resources persists, it doesn’t matter even if a few geniuses and powerhouses die. They have the ability to create more geniuses and powerhouses. All they need is time,” Ah Sheng said.

Zhou Wen knew that Ah Sheng was right. The reason the six families were strong wasn’t because a particular genius was strong, but because they already had a complete model for the family’s survival. They could obtain endless resources and nurture all sorts of geniuses. To overthrow such a family, killing a few geniuses and powerhouses was useless. Unless the entire family was thrown into a situation of certain doom, they would eventually rise again.

Just like the Cape family, many geniuses had died because of Zhou Wen, but they remained standing.

According to An Sheng, the antelope and Chick were by the fake Zhou Wen’s side. Only by doing so could they fool the people who were paying attention to Zhou Wen. Therefore, they weren’t in the An family, but guarding Chess Mountain with the fake Zhou Wen.

After chatting with An Sheng, Zhou Wen took out his mysterious phone and entered the game again.

Snow Valley’s Gu Mother hadn’t respawned. Zhou Wen didn’t choose to head to the Sapphire Sky either. Instead, he chose to head to the Endless Sea of Stars dungeon to see if he could kill the Planet Devourer.

He also farmed the Constellation Sea, but he still failed to obtain the final twenty-eight Lunar Mansions skill.

After leaving the range of the Constellation Sea, Zhou Wen summoned Banana Fairy and Demonic Neonate. Not long after, he sensed spatial fluctuations as the gigantic Planet Devourer appeared above them.

The jellyfish-like Planet Devourer emitted intense starlight, but ordinary people couldn’t see it.

In its body, there was a vortex that resembled a black hole. Everything that approached it was sucked into the black hole.

The moment the Planet Devourer descended, the terrifying suction force descended.

Banana Fairy directly used the Supreme Yin Wind at the Planet Devourer. With the augmentation of Three Realms’ Best Wind, this surge was extremely terrifying.

However, when the Supreme Yin Wind reached the Planet Devourer, it was sucked in by the black hole in its body.

Banana Fairy fanned out Supreme Yang Wind next, but the outcome was the same. They were all sucked into the black hole.

Banana Fairy frowned slightly. The fan in her hand which was transformed from the banana leaf showed a half Yin and half Yang state. At the instant she fanned at the Planet Devourer, Yin and Yang combined into one, transforming into Boundless wind that swept towards the Planet Devourer.
