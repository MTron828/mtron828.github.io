Chapter 999: Arena

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and got it to block in front of him.

With a boom, the red ball immediately turned into a ball of flames after hitting the Great Might Vajra Bull, enveloping its entire body.

Thankfully, the Great Might Vajra Bull’s body was sufficiently powerful. The Epic flames had no effect on it.

Seeing that the red ball was useless, the clown threw the blue ball out. After the blue ball exploded from the collision, it formed a huge ice fog that could freeze people into ice.

Unfortunately, it was only at the Epic stage. The Great Might Vajra Bull trembled and the frost on its body immediately fell to the ground. It couldn’t be injured at all.

Finally, the clown threw out the yellow ball. This time, after the yellow ball shattered, there was no fire or ice. There was only a plume of smoke, and then there was nothing.

This yellow ball should be the so-called elastic ball, right? From the looks of it, it’s useless. It has no effect on Mythical creatures. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about it, Great Might Vajra took a step forward.

With this step, the Great Might Vajra Bull’s body seemed to have a spring installed in it. Its body leaped up high. When it landed, it landed heavily on the ground before being bounced even higher.

The Great Might Vajra Bull waved its hooves in the air, but it couldn’t control its body. Its body seemed to have turned into a bouncing ball as it bounced around the ancient castle.

Although the puppet clown’s strength couldn’t injure the Great Might Vajra Bull, it left it in a sorry state.

This skill is interesting! Zhou Wen suddenly realized that this skill was quite good. It could actually affect Mythical creatures.

However, this skill was clearly useless against the Mischief Clown. The Great Might Vajra Bull quickly adapted to the elasticity before transforming into its thousand-handed, bull-headed form. With a golden beam in its hand, it blasted the clown apart.

Zhou Wen circled the maze and encountered quite a number of Mischief Clowns. Therefore, he killed every one of them, hoping to obtain a few Mischief Clown Companion Eggs to use for synthesis in the future.

This skill was useless for the Mischief Clown, but it might be useful when paired with powerful pets.

As he farmed the clowns, he searched the maze. However, in the maze that resembled an amusement park, there were Mischief Clowns everywhere, but he didn’t see any other dimensional creatures.

Strange, Li Benyi clearly said that there were many strange dimensional creatures here. Why do I only see clowns? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled, but he couldn’t find any other dimensional creatures.

...

While Zhou Wen was grinding dungeons, the news of his battle with Joseph had already spread throughout Frost City. It wasn’t just the members of the Ultimate Family Clan. Even the other families and ordinary people in Frost City learned of this news.

Ordinary people weren’t too familiar with the name Zhou Wen, but some of the more powerful families knew what the name represented.

Before the Guardians appeared, Zhou Wen was synonymous with invincibility among the younger generation. However, with the Guardians around, no one could guarantee that Zhou Wen would be as invincible as before.

The top fourteen on the rankings were all Guardians. Such a battle result was too dazzling, making it impossible for people not to treat the strength of Guardians seriously. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Although Joseph’s Lie Guardian was only ranked 14th, it still suppressed all Companion Beasts that fought alone. Furthermore, the Lie had never fought other Guardians. Perhaps its combat strength was higher than its actual ranking.

Therefore, early at dawn the next day, many people from Frost City went to the arena. However, most of them were here to see the Guardian. Only a small number of people had expectations for Zhou Wen.

When Zhou Wen arrived at the arena, he saw that it was already packed with people. Even the top of the walls had people standing on them, and the entrance was packed to the brim.

“Brother, can you make way and let us pass?” Li Xuan led the way, but after squeezing for a long time, he failed to squeeze in. There were too many people inside.

“Let you pass? As if I don’t wish to enter? Do you think it will work? If it works, I’ll be watching the duel inside. If you want to watch the duel, slowly squeeze in. Don’t keep thinking about stupid tricks,” the man in front said.

Li Xuan thought to himself, If Zhou Wen doesn’t enter, what match is there to watch?

He naturally couldn’t say that, so he could only continue squeezing in.

Thankfully, Li Xuan had a solution. He released some Stinky Gu and immediately, the people nearby couldn’t help but squeeze to the side. Finally, they had more space to move around.

However, this move hurt indiscriminately. It wasn’t easy for them either.

After squeezing in with great difficulty, there was still a sea of people inside. It was unknown why the people of Frost City were so free to come here early in the morning to watch their duel.

“From the looks of it, that punk, Joseph, has spent quite a bit of effort. He got so many people here just to finish you in front of everyone.” Li Xuan saw through Joseph’s thoughts.

“Actually, I don’t like so many spectators,” Zhou Wen said.

The few of them continued to squeeze in. Thankfully, Gulli discovered them through the surveillance cameras and sent someone to pick them up.

“Why did you enter through the main entrance? Why didn’t you use the special underground passageway!?” Gulli asked Zhou Wen and company in puzzlement.

“There’s a special passageway?” The three of them were taken aback.

“You said there was no need to pick you up, so I thought you knew. Let’s not talk about this. Let’s head to the lounge to prepare. That punk, Joseph, is dying of eagerness,” Gulli said.

Joseph was indeed impatient. The two of them should have gone on stage at the same time, but Joseph had already long appeared in the arena. Furthermore, this fellow was delivering a speech.

“Although I grew up in Frost City, I believe there are many people who don’t know my name. My name is Joseph, and I’m a member of the Ultimate Family Clan. As a person chosen by God, I’ve signed a contract with a Guardian, I will represent the deities to protect Frost City of Frost. No matter what difficulties I encounter, even if I have to sacrifice my life, I will fight foreign enemies to the death...”

“It’s a pity this fellow isn’t a politician...” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips when he heard Joseph’s speech.

However, the ordinary citizens who didn’t know Joseph well cheered after hearing his words. Some even shouted his name. It looked like he had successfully fooled many people.

“What a worrisome fellow,” Gulli said gloomily. Zhou Wen saw Sadie, Lance, and company when he arrived in the lounge.

“Zhou Wen, you definitely can defeat him and let those people know how powerful Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui are, right?” Li Benyi asked Zhou Wen.

“Of course. I still have some experience in killing Guardians. Don’t worry.” Zhou Wen ruffled Li Benyi’s hair before walking towards the entrance.

The moment Zhou Wen walked out of the tunnel, he immediately heard a tsunami-like booing.

Regardless of who was in the right or wrong, from the perspective of the people in Frost City, Zhou Wen was an outsider. They were naturally more willing to support the local Joseph and had treated Zhou Wen as an enemy.
