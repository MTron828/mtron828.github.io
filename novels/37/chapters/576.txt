Chapter 577 The Thearch“s Drug

Zhou Wen had naturally sensed the snail’s departure, but he didn’t chase after it.

The Hell King Life Soul could only prevent the tiny threads from clinging onto his body, but if the snail unleashed its strength, it could still destroy Zhou Wen’s body.

The snail’s retreat without fighting Zhou Wen wasn’t due to the Hell King Life Soul.

Although the Hell King Life Soul was good at strengthening his body, even Torch Dragon and Six-Winged’s attacks couldn’t injure the snail. Zhou Wen didn’t believe that the Hell King Life Soul could really threaten it, so he was still somewhat puzzled when the snail retreated.

However, no matter what, he had finally resolved a huge problem. Zhou Wen quickly left the bone sand desert, not daring to stay any longer.

He used his phone to look at his information and realized that the postfix—Guilt—of his Constitution had vanished. The Life Soul that Small Perfection of Wisdom had condensed was also Hell King. It had the effect of strengthening his mind and body, but this wasn’t the most important ability. The strongest aspect of the Hell King Life Soul was turning the body into a Life Soul. Zhou Wen didn’t know what use it had, for now, so he could only slowly study it.

After returning to the temple, Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief when he didn’t see the snail appear.

I should just game in the future. Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to give up. He lay in the tent and launched the game before heading to the bone sand desert to get Torch Dragon and Six-Winged to continue digging.

However, Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. He didn’t find the fossilized rhinoceros in-game, neither did he find the snail. He only found a few bones. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

There’s no snail in-game? Zhou Wen spent two days searching the bone sand desert, but he still failed to find the snail or encounter any other danger.

As for treasures, he found nothing.

...

The hidden forces An Sheng had set up, failed to capture Qu Qingyun. It was unknown if Qu Qingyun had covered his tracks well or if he had already used some method to escape the ruins.

An Sheng didn’t have the time to be stationed here. All he could do was send someone to guard the ruins and bring Zhou Wen back to Luoyang.

On the way, Zhou Wen used his phone to check the Internet. Indeed, just as An Sheng had said, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s ranking had dropped to fifth place. There were already 37 Companion Beasts on the rankings. There were a few more than what An Sheng had said.

Should I get Torch Dragon on the rankings as well? Zhou Wen had been pondering over this question.

Beep! Beep! A message was sent by The Thearch.

"I have a gift for you. Accept it with the Void Flower." Zhou Wen immediately had an ominous feeling when he read the message.

Zhou Wen refused to believe that The Thearch would take the initiative to deliver something good to him.

"I’m driving now. The Void Flower isn’t with me. What gift did you send me?" Zhou Wen probed.

"It’s a world-shaking invention that I came up with. You lucked out," The Thearch replied.

What shocking invention? Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. If it was just an experimental product made of chemicals, Zhou Wen felt that it couldn’t be too dangerous.

"You’ll know when you get back." The Thearch kept him guessing.

After returning to school, Zhou Wen took out the Void Flower pot from the chaos space. The Void Flower couldn’t open a portal in the chaos space; therefore, when Zhou Wen took it out, a portal appeared on the flower. Something floated out.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that it was a glass bottle. It was one of the items he had bought for The Thearch. It wasn’t dangerous, so he reached out to catch it.

Inside the glass bottle was half a bottle of purple liquid. It was unknown what it was.

He didn’t know what the purple liquid was, but Zhou Wen definitely didn’t dare use it. Just as he was about to put it into the chaos space, he received a message from The Thearch.

"Have you received it? Let your Companion Beast drink it. Then, it’s time to witness a miracle."

No matter how Zhou Wen looked at it, The Thearch’s tone was like a scammer online.

However, since it wasn’t for him to drink, Zhou Wen didn’t mind. It didn’t matter if he gave it a try. After all, he had plenty of Companion Beasts.

After randomly summoning a Chi and letting it drink The Thearch’s medicine, Zhou Wen stared at it with widened eyes.

According to what Zhou Wen knew, ordinary chemicals didn’t have much use for Companion Beasts. Instead, they had a certain effect on dimensional creatures that could make them mutate.

Unfortunately, Companion Beasts were pure energy bodies, so their composition was relatively stable. The possibility of mutation was very low, so chemicals were useless.

However, after the Chi drank the medicine, its body seemed to be dyed purple—the same color as the drug. Its body also rapidly transformed as it underwent a significant change.

After the transformation ended, its body hadn’t appeared to have undergone many changes. Even the purple color faded.

Zhou Wen took a look at its stats and realized that its stats had greatly increased. It had gained another skill, making it one of the best at the Epic stage.

Ignoring the increase in stats, it had actually allowed the Chi to comprehend a new skill. It went from two skills to three skills; a shocking feat.

"Thearch, what drug did you give me?" Zhou Wen sent a message to The Thearch.

"The Pet Skill Insights Agent I invented can stimulate the potential of a Companion Beast, allowing it to comprehend a hidden talent ability. The effects aren’t bad, right? I’m guessing you didn’t dare give it to your Six-Winged and Truth Listener. Instead, you let an ordinary Companion Beast drink it. Are you regretting it now?" The Thearch seemed to see through Zhou Wen’s thoughts. It was as though she had seen Zhou Wen’s actions with her own eyes.

Zhou Wen knew that The Thearch was deliberately trying to see his regret by not mentioning the effects of the drug in the beginning. Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t let her wish come true.

"Who knows if your drug is really useful. Perhaps it’s only effective on low-level Companion Beasts and useless for high-level ones?" Zhou Wen deliberately said.

"Goading me on is useless. You’re too old-fashioned. If you want a Pet Skill Insights Agent, you have to exchange it with something." The Thearch’s words were filled with contempt.

"No thanks then," Zhou Wen immediately replied.

Who knew if The Thearch’s medicine had any side effects. Zhou Wen found it unreliable no matter how he thought about it. How could ordinary chemicals allow a Companion Beast to gain insights into a skill? It was highly likely that she had added something else.

"It’s fine if you don’t want the Pet Skill Insights Agent, but you have to return me the items." The Thearch directly sent a list.

"How much Pet Skill Insights Agent can these items get?" Since he couldn’t reject it, he naturally had to try his best to benefit himself.

"One bottle," The Thearch replied.

"At least ten bottles. I was the one who bought all the ingredients you used to make the drug, right? It’s not worth that much money." Zhou Wen deliberately said this to know if The Thearch had added anything else.

However, The Thearch didn’t answer him. "Two bottles. It’s up to you whether you want them or not, but you have to buy and deliver everything on the list in a month."
