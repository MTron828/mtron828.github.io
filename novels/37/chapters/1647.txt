Chapter 1648 Mythical Object

The Companion Beast chased after them as Zhou Wen and company fled beneath the glacier. Thankfully, with the glacier as cover, the Companion Beast’s attacks were somewhat obstructed. “Zhou Wen, don’t tell me you want to use the terrain to stall for time?” Jiuyang released the Sun God Light from his body as though a volcano had erupted, sending the pursuing phantoms retreating.

“No, there’s another Companion Beast down there. Perhaps that thing can save our lives.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he had already rushed to the side of the pool.

“There’s another Companion Beast?” Jiuyang and Xiao were first taken aback before they immediately reacted.

Could it be that the parasitized Companion Beast isn’t dead? After Jiuyang’s first thought, he immediately thought of another possibility and continued, “Which one is the parasitized Companion Beast?”

“I don’t know,” Zhou Wen said as he plunged into the pool.

Jiuyang and Xiao charged down as well. The Companion Beast pursuing them struck the pool with terrifying power, blasting a hole through the pool and the nearby glaciers, forming a huge crater.

The pool wasn’t deep to begin with, so when it blasted through, it revealed the strange plant. Zhou Wen and company suffered immense pressure in the water as they were slammed into the glacier beside them.

The surrounding glaciers shattered. Only the glacier where the strange plant was remained intact. Neither the bee in the fruit nor the plant were affected.

Zhou Wen and company got up from the ice crater and prepared to fight, but they realized that the Companion Beast was floating in the air. It didn’t continue attacking. Instead, it stared at the bee in the strange plant.

“They are indeed related,” Jiuyang said.

“I never expected the Companion Beast that was parasitized to still be alive. However, I wonder which of the two of them is the Companion Beast born from the planet itself.” Xiao looked at the bee and then at the Companion Beast in the sky. A strange glint flashed in his eyes as though he had discovered something

In fact, Jiuyang had also discovered Xiao’s discovery.

The bee held a trumpet in its claws. No matter how one looked at it, it didn’t look like something a bee should have. It was likely an external object.

According to Holy God, the escaping Companion Beast had accidentally taken something away before parasitizing the planet.

Although Holy God didn’t say what that thing was, from the looks of it, it was very likely this tiny trumpet.

Of course, this was only their guess. It might not be accurate. The Companion Beast that chased after them seemed to be afraid of the bee. It floated in the air without coming down. It kept staring at the bee, its gaze focused on the tiny trumpet. It didn’t move, nor did Zhou Wen. Jiuyang and Xiao didn’t dare move either, hoping to wait for an opportunity.

Zhou Wen hoped to stall for time until Tsukuyomi finished her absorption. When that happened, he wouldn’t have any qualms about fighting or escaping, unlike how bound he was.

“Are you hiding something from me?” Zhou Wen’s observational abilities were extremely sharp, so how could he not notice that the Companion Beast was constantly looking at the trumpet?

Furthermore, Jiuyang and Xiao were also looking at the trumpet. This made Zhou Wen even more certain that they knew something.

Jiuyang pondered for a moment and said, “At this point, there’s no need to hide it from you. According to what we know, when the Companion Beast passed through the Mythical battlefield, it accidentally brought something into the planet. As the planet is protected by the rules of the universe, even Heaven-level creatures can’t forcefully open the planet unless the Companion Beast inside it is about to appear. Therefore, no one can retrieve it.” “What did the Companion Beast bring in? Zhou Wen was very curious.”

He roughly knew that there had been a Mythical era on Earth. In that era, countless powerful lifeforms had fought on Earth or even in the universe.

However, for some reason, these powerful existences either vanished or sealed themselves.

According to the various information Zhou Wen already knew, the dimensional zones in the Mythical era on Earth were very likely to have opened. Later on, for some reason, they were sealed again. Only when the dimensional storms of recent times descended did the sealed dimensional zones open again.

Therefore, Zhou Wen had always been curious about what had happened during the Mythical era.

as

Of course, this was only his speculation. Only lifeforms who had experienced that era knew if this was the case.

However, even an existence like Grim Demon who had experienced that era couldn’t figure out how the final Mythical battle ended.

Perhaps only an existence like The Thearch will truly know what happened in the Mythical era. Zhou Wen had always felt that The Thearch definitely knew many things. Zhou Wen still found The Thearch unfathomable like a bottomless abyss.

In the past, when Zhou Wen was young, he felt that The Thearch was very strong. Now, he could fight Calamity-grade creatures, but that didn’t change his former views.

In fact, the stronger he was, the more he found The Thearch’s strength unbelievable.

The power of wish was heaven-defying. Even a Heaven-level domain was inferior to it.

“I don’t know.” Jiuyang shook his head and said, “The information we obtained was only that the Companion Beast brought in something very important, but we don’t know what it is. Now, we are very suspicious that it’s the trumpet in the bee’s claw.” “If it’s really the trumpet, doesn’t that mean that the bee is the Companion Beast parasite? The fellow we fought is a native of this planet?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“If the trumpet is really that thing, that guess is very likely.” Xiao had been observing the Companion Beast in the air. Halfway through his sentence, he suddenly changed the topic. “Be careful. That fellow can’t hold back.”

Indeed, just as Xiao said that, the Companion Beast rushed down. Its target was obvious. It wasn’t any of Zhou Wen and company, but the bee in the fruit.

When the Companion Beast took one step, the light on its foot was as dazzling as the sun. It was Jiuyang’s Sun God Light that it mimicked.

Although the Sun God Light wasn’t scorching hot enough when used by it, its destructive power was even more terrifying than when Jiuyang used it.

The bee in the fruit was still lying there as though it hadn’t woken up. The bee remained motionless even when the Companion Beast’s sun-like feet stepped on the fruit.

Boom!

A powerful force struck the fruit, triggering a terrifying explosion. Even with Zhou Wen and company’s strength, they couldn’t help but retreat from the shockwave produced by the explosion.
