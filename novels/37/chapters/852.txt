Chapter 853: Incubating Earth Elemental Beast

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen followed the steps and easily eliminated Ghost Hornless. When he dug up the Fiend Tomb, he was very careful, afraid that he would alarm the Goddess Ba.

Thankfully, nothing unexpected happened. After killing Ghost Hornless, Zhou Wen used the Fiend Stones to fill up the dug up Fiend Tomb before meeting up with Zhang Chunqiu.

As for Zhang Chunqiu, he had already prepared the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg. When they met, he gave it to Zhou Wen.

“Aren’t you afraid that I didn’t complete the mission?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“What’s there to be afraid of? You can run but you can’t hide. Could you not return to Luoyang for the rest of your life?” Zhang Chunqiu curled his lips and said.

“Thankfully, I’ve already completed the mission,” Zhou Wen said.

Zhang Chunqiu thought for a moment and said, “You have to be careful of the other families, especially Moses. He won’t let it go easily.”

Zhou Wen nodded. “I know.”

“Let’s not talk about anything else. If there’s anything you need from my Zhang family, just say the word. If there’s anything you need, you can stay in Celestial Master Manor for a year or so,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile.

“That will be unnecessary. I still have some matters to attend to. After I’m done here, I plan on returning. Can you help me make arrangements to bid farewell to Yuzhi?” Zhou Wen asked.

“She’s waiting for you at Celestial Master Manor.”

...

“I never expected the Earth Elemental Beast to fall into Zhou Wen’s hands. Your Cape family has worked for nothing,” Moses said to Charlie with a smile. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Didn’t your Family Clan of Gods end up empty-handed as well?” Charlie’s face was somewhat pale. Although he had escaped death, he had suffered some hidden injuries due to the Evil Ghost Mask’s control.

Moses smiled and said, “That might not be the case. He definitely needs external help to incubate a Mythical Companion Egg. I don’t think Zhou Wen can hatch the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg quickly. We still have a chance of getting it back.”

“You want to snatch the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg?” Charlie stared at Moses and asked.

“Zhou Wen previously agreed to fight me. If I win the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg fair and square, how can this be called snatching?” Moses said indifferently.

“Hmph, then what do you mean by coming here to tell me this?” Charlie said thoughtfully.

“I’m afraid that Zhou Wen won’t dare to accept the challenge and will run away at the last moment. Therefore, I wish to ask you to help me. If Zhou Wen wants to escape or doesn’t dare to accept the challenge, help me intercept him. With your Book of Prophecy, it will be difficult for him to escape even if he has wings,” said Moses.

“Why should I help you?” Charlie said coldly.

“No, no, no. You aren’t helping me, but helping yourself. Even if you can track him, are you confident of defeating Tyrant Behemoth? And I can defeat Tyrant Behemoth. If we work together, we can definitely snatch back the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg. When the time comes, our families will explore the Founding Emperor Tomb together and split the benefits equally. What do you think?” Moses said.

“Hmph, you make it sound nice. There’s only one Earth Elemental Beast. Without it, you can’t enter the Founding Emperor Tomb. How can we cooperate?” Charlie naturally didn’t believe Moses’s nonsense.

“To show my sincerity, after we retrieve the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg, your Cape family will be responsible for incubating it. This way, you should believe me, right?” Moses smiled.

“Do I have your word?” Charlie looked at Moses in disbelief.

Without the Earth Elemental Beast, one couldn’t enter the Founding Emperor Tomb. Previously, the six heroes had nearly fallen out because of this Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg. Now, Moses was willing to take the initiative to give it up. He found it unbelievable.

“Our families are from the West District. Although there are occasional conflicts, we are still family. The Founding Emperor Tomb is an important dimensional zone in the East District. If we cross districts like this, I’m afraid the Xia and Zhang families won’t sit back and do nothing. If our two families cooperate, we might be able to bring back everything inside. Otherwise, it’s very likely that we will get out the items and only serve to benefit the Zhang and Xia families. I’m not sure if the Xia family will participate, but the Zhang family took the initiative to give the Earth Elemental Beast away. Do you think they are really so kind as to give up the things in the Founding Emperor Tomb?” Moses asked.

After some thought, Charlie nodded and said, “What you said makes sense. We are also willing to cooperate, but the premise is that the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg must be incubated by our family.”

“Of course. I’ve already said that the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg is yours, but you have to split the spoils 50-50,” said Moses.

“Deal.” Charlie extended his palm.

While they were discussing how to snatch back the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg, Zhou Wen was already prepared to incubate it.

Typical Epic humans needed external help to hatch Mythical Companion Eggs if they wanted to incubate them. They needed plenty of preparation in the early stages, but Zhou Wen didn’t need it at all. He didn’t even need Slaughterer’s infinite Essence Energy. Dao Sutra, and First Order of Chaos could help him incubate Mythical Companion Beasts.

Earth Elemental Beast: Mythical

Life Providence: Earth Life

Life Soul: Essence of Earth

Wheel of Destiny: Earth of the Five Elements

Strength: 80

Speed: 80

Constitution: 80

Essence Energy: 80

Talent Skill: Earth Escape

Companion Form: Mount

From the looks of it, the Earth Elemental Beast is purely a mount-type Companion Beast. It doesn’t have any special offensive skills, but just the Earth Escape mount makes it excellent. After Zhou Wen saw its stats, he hatched it.

Soon, a Companion Beast that resembled a pangolin but was as large as a dinosaur appeared in front of Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen tried it in-game and realized that the Earth Elemental Beast lived up to its name. Although it didn’t have any offensive skills, this Earth Escape skill could be activated repeatedly as long as one had Essence Energy. The cooldown time was very short.

With the Earth Elemental Beast’s Essence Energy maxed out, it could instantly carry out Earth Escape for more than fifty kilometers with Zhou Wen. It was truly a life-saving weapon.

It was also useful for assassination. In the midst of an army of ten thousand, an Earth Escape could allow him to appear in front of the enemy commander and kill him with one strike. Then, he could escape easily via Earth Escape. No matter how many enemies there were, they couldn’t stop the Earth Elemental Beast.

As long as I’m on the ground, I won’t have to be afraid of being besieged in the future. Zhou Wen was delighted, but on careful thought, there were also the four similar mounts of Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire. If he could obtain them all, he wondered if he could use the phone’s functions to fuse them into one.

While Zhou Wen was still studying how to use the Earth Elemental Beast, Moses sent someone to deliver a challenge letter. He wanted to have a fair duel with Zhou Wen to determine who was better.

After reading the invitation, Zhou Wen rejected it without any hesitation. Firstly, it was because he didn’t know what abilities Giant God Sovereign had. Secondly, he didn’t need to give Moses an excuse to openly snatch the Earth Elemental Beast.

If Moses wasn’t willing to give up on the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg, he could only secretly snatch it. When that happened, Zhou Wen would be taking the moral high ground. No matter what he did to Moses or what methods he used, no one could blame him.

Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of being criticized, but there was no need for him to take the risk of fighting the unknown Giant God Sovereign. It would be too dangerous if the Giant God Sovereign was comparable to Ant City’s Guardian.
