Chapter 1730 Level Gap

The moment the Chaos Egg shattered, the killing intent in the woman’s eyes intensified. Since Zhou Wen couldn’t be used by her, she definitely couldn’t allow such a human to exist in the world.

The Nihility Sword Aura pressed down on Zhou Wen from all directions, hoping to crush his body to dust.

Zhou Wen’s eyes were clear. The dark golden wheel behind Great Brahma’s armor shimmered with a dark glow as though all the light in the world was being sucked in by it.

“Break!” Great Brahma’s destructive power bloomed with Zhou Wen’s fist as he struck the woman.

Boom!

The power of Great Brahma slammed into the Nihility Sword Aura and shattered it. Zhou Wen took the opportunity to charge at the woman.

A look of surprise flashed in the woman’s eyes. Although the Nihility Sword Aura wasn’t as indestructible as the Chaos Egg, there weren’t many forces that could blast through

In a situation of equal strength, there were definitely no more than ten powers in the dimension that could withstand the Nihility Sword Aura. For Zhou Wen’s strength to blast through the Nihility Sword Aura meant that the Essence Energy Art he cultivated was in the top ten, or at least similar.

However, this wasn’t enough to surprise the woman. What truly surprised her was that Zhou Wen had chosen to clash with her head-on.

From the point of view of the average person, the front was where the power was the strongest. If Zhou Wen only wanted to crack the Nihility Sword Aura, he should attack from other weak spots.

However, the Nihility Sword Aura wasn’t the case. In fact, the woman had placed the weakest point of the Nihility Sword Aura right in front.

Zhou Wen chose the front. It was unknown if he had really seen through it or if he was lucky to attack the weakest spot.

Is it just a coincidence? The woman’s killing intent intensified.

The two Essence Energy Arts that Zhou Wen had displayed were extremely rare in the dimension. One was the pure defense of Chaos, while the other had destructive power. It was somewhat similar to the supreme power of the Buddha race, but there were obvious differences. It appeared like an anomalous Essence Energy Art.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen had cultivated four Essence Energy Arts. Even if the other two Essence Energy Arts weren’t comparable to these two, it was already terrifying enough.

The woman’s hand moved slightly as the invisible sword beams once again closed in on Zhou Wen from all directions.

Boom!

Zhou Wen actually broke through the Nihility Sword Aura again. This time, Zhou Wen chose the leftmost area to break through the Void Sword Aura. It happened to be the weakest spot.

It’s not a coincidence! A strange glint flashed in the woman’s eyes as she once again condensed the Nihility Sword Aura to suppress Zhou Wen.

The outcome was the same. Zhou Wen could choose the weakest spot to break every time, making it difficult for her to kill him.

“You can actually see the Nihility Sword Aura?” the woman said as she stared at Zhou Wen. The sword aura on her body continued crushing down at him.

“If you can see through my Chaos powers, why can’t I see through your Nihility Sword Aura?” Zhou Wen broke through the sword beams again and again as he asked.

In fact, Zhou Wen wasn’t having it well. Great Brahma’s destructive power was ultimately inferior to the Nihility Sword Aura. Every time he tore through the sword aura, Zhou Wen would suffer a backlash.

If his body was at the Heaven level, such a recoil wouldn’t be able to injure him. However, he was only at the Terror grade. Such a recoil affected his body significantly.

If not for the Great Brahma armor having already absorbed and reflected most of the force, his body would have long collapsed. Now, Zhou Wen felt as though his organs were about to rupture as blood seeped out of his seven orifices.

Thankfully, with the armor enveloping his body, the woman couldn’t see Zhou Wen’s situation.

“Is that so? Then let me see if you really understand.” The Nihility Sword Aura on the woman’s body suddenly converged and transformed into an invisible sword in her hand.

The woman realized that the scattered Nihility Sword Aura wasn’t enough to kill Zhou Wen, but the Nihility Sword Aura she condensed was enough to easily break through Great Brahma’s destructive power.

The woman slashed out at an unbelievable speed. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Zhou Wen quickly moved as he condensed Great Brahma’s power to blast at the Nihility sword beam.

Crack!

The power of Great Brahma that could absorb and destroy everything like a black hole was sliced apart by the Nihility sword beam in the woman’s hand as though it was tofu.

However, Zhou Wen also used that instant to dodge the Nihility Sword Aura’s slash.

The woman slashed three times in a row, and Zhou Wen dodged all three times. Although he was in a sorry state and barely dodged each time, it was enough to surprise the woman.

“As expected, you understand,” the woman said coldly. “But so what if you understand? I’ll let you know what the gap in level is.”

Only then did the woman move her feet and stab at Zhou Wen like a fairy.

This strike was fast enough. Zhou Wen saw an opportunity and suddenly drew the immortal sword to slash at the woman’s body.

The immortal sword slashed at the invisible sword beam like a blood beam, but it brushed past it. The woman’s figure was like a veil in water as she gracefully swept past Zhou Wen. The invisible sword beam streaked across the Great Brahma armor and sliced through the nearly indestructible dark-gold armor.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to use instant transmission on the mountaintop. Only then did he barely dodge the strike before the sword sliced through his body.

On Great Brahma’s armor, there was a crack that nearly covered his entire chest. Blood was seeping out of the wound.

“You can actually use spatial teleportation on this mountain?” The woman looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.

“Why can’t I?” Zhou Wen didn’t feel any discomfort. It was probably due to the effects of the Teacher Domain that he wasn’t injured by the restrictions on the mountain.

“Alright,” the woman said out of the blue as she slashed at Zhou Wen again.

Her form was light and ethereal. Every strike was like a dance. Each strike didn’t seem to have much strength exerted, but Zhou Wen knew that any strike was enough to cause pandemonium.

It was also in a place like Kunlun Mountain that greatly suppressed the energy fluctuations. Just the fluctuations of the sword aura could probably collapse a mountain.

One strike after another, Zhou Wen used the immortal sword in one hand and the power of Great Brahma in the other to resist the woman’s Nihility Sword Aura.

However, from beginning to end, be it the immortal sword or the power of Great Brahma, they failed to touch the woman’s Nihility Sword Aura.

The woman seemed to be able to predict the future. Even if Zhou Wen used instant transmission, she could appear where he had instant transmitted. When Zhou Wen instant transmitted, the sword beam was almost on his neck.

Zhou Wen suddenly flipped the immortal sword in his hand and used the hilt to block the Nihility Sword Aura. Only then did he escape the beheading calamity. He didn’t dare continue instant transmitting. A bloody mark on his neck was testament that Great Brahma armor couldn’t block the terrifying Nihility Sword Aura.

In just a moment, Zhou Wen’s Great Brahma armor was covered in bloody marks as blood seeped out in a ghastly sight.
