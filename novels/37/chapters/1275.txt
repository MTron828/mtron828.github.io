Chapter 1276: Killing an Angel with a Sword

After the slaying of Di Tian, there was probably no one among the humans who didn’t recognize the Immortal Culling Sword, even though many people in the Federation were selling replicas.

However, for a human to dare enter a Calamity-grade battlefield on Venus with such a sword, the possibility of him being Human Sovereign was undoubtedly very high.

“Oh my goodness, Boss, is this really Human Sovereign?” The staff by the side became excited.

“The possibility is very high. To be able to appear in a place like Venus, and for the signal to come from the bureau… Immediately switch the signal source… By the way… Be more careful… Use the word ‘suspected’ in the press release later…”

The news media outlet, the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau, soon started operating at full speed. Not long after, the people who were watching the other media outlets turned to the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau because they heard a particular name.

“F*ck… Is this really Human Sovereign?”

“That sword looks like it.”

“To be able to go to a place like Venus and even dare to enter a Calamity-grade battlefield, I really can’t think of anyone other than the Human Sovereign.”

“Oh my god, Human Sovereign has finally appeared again. It’s been five years. He’s finally back.”

“What’s Human Sovereign doing there? It looks like he’s walking towards Seraph!”

“No way… Could it be…”

“No…” The angels’ believers felt mixed emotions to the extreme.

Human Sovereign was the spiritual pillar of humanity, but angels were also their faith and spiritual pillar. They were unwilling to see the scene that they were guessing was about to happen.

However, what would come, would come. Everyone could tell that Human Sovereign was walking towards the seraph, and the seraph was also staring at Human Sovereign.

“This fellow hasn’t done anything in the past few years, but the moment he appears, he causes such a huge commotion. Does he like to be in the limelight that much?” Xia Liuchuan said with a strange expression.

“Does he need to rely on causing commotions to be in the limelight?” Zhang Chunqiu shook his head.

“That’s true…” Xia Liuchuan thought for a long time and said helplessly.

If Human Sovereign really wanted to be in the limelight, he didn’t need to do anything.

“What is he trying to do?” In the League of Guardians, Cave Era, Hermit, and company had mixed expressions. They were both respectful and afraid of Human Sovereign.

From the standpoint of humans, they believed that Human Sovereign had indeed fought for humanity, preserving humanity’s last dignity in the face of the dimension’s creatures.

However, they were now in the League of Guardians and were working for the dimension. Without a doubt, they were at odds with Human Sovereign.

Immortal just sat there and watched. He didn’t show any expression, nor did the look in his eyes change. It was unknown what he was thinking.

“That fellow finally can’t stand the loneliness.” In the president’s office of the Holy Spirit Association, Zhong Ziya was wearing a white bathrobe and hugging a sword. He was leaning diagonally against the window with a glass of wine in his hand. He was watching the live broadcast.

The number of viewers watching the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau stream increased exponentially. Out of the people who could go online, more than 70% of them were watching their live broadcast. The words ‘Human Sovereign’ were just too attractive.

Zhou Wen didn’t know that many people were watching him. Even if he knew, he wouldn’t take it to heart. All he wanted to do now was see if the Immortal Culling Sword could slay the woman and end this scourge.

Now, Zhou Wen’s only worry was that the woman would run away when she saw the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand. After all, many people had seen the Immortal Culling Sword and knew how powerful it was.

Zhou Wen was clearly overthinking things. The woman didn’t know about the Immortal Culling Sword due to her long tenure in the Present Hut. She didn’t know about the battle with Di Tian, so she naturally didn’t know how powerful it was.

The woman frowned slightly when she saw Zhou Wen alive. She immediately raised her Blazing Flame Sword and slashed at Zhou Wen who was walking out of the chasm.

Being in her six-winged seraphim state was just too draining on her. She had to resolve the problem as soon as possible, or the consequences would be dire. All she wanted to do now was kill Zhou Wen as soon as possible. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the corner of the woman’s eyes, there were already some fine patterns that made her look at least ten years older than before. This was already a sign that something was wrong with her body.

This strike was even more terrifying than the previous two strikes. The six-winged seraphim’s strength continued to increase with time.

The sword beam shot down from the heavens as though it wanted to split apart the cosmos. It was a spectacle when it slashed down—as though even Venus would be split into two by this strike.

“Ah!” Those who cared about Human Sovereign couldn’t help but worry when they saw such a terrifying attack.

Some of the more timid women didn’t even dare watch further. They turned their heads and waited nervously for the outcome.

“Human Sovereign is still human after all. He shouldn’t be enemies with Seraph. That’s a true Apostle of God…” the archbishop muttered to himself.

Most believers ultimately felt that their faith was more important and more powerful.

Ordinary eyes were unable to keep up with the sword beam’s speed. All they could see was the terrifying sword beam cleaving into the ground like it was chopping at a watermelon. The entire world seemed to be illuminated by the sword beam’s radiance, making it impossible to see anything.

Hum!

A sword hum resounded through the universe as a black rift opened in the world that was almost occupied by the sword beam.

The crack streaked across the sky like a straight black line on white paper.

Crack!

The white paper split open from top to bottom as the sword beam disintegrated. Everyone’s vision returned to normal.

Human Sovereign was still standing in his spot. His hand was still holding the hilt of his saber as though he had never moved.

As for the six-winged seraphim projection in the sky, it remained motionless as though it had never moved.

Just as people were wondering what was going on, they suddenly saw the angel’s projection shatter like glass. A figure fell out. It was a woman with six wings and a halo above her head like an angel.

However, at that moment, she didn’t look like a noble angel. Her body was covered in blood, and four of the angel wings on her back had been sliced off. Her body had also been sliced in two as she plummeted deep into the rift.

“Impossible…” The archbishop was dumbfounded, almost unable to believe what he had seen.

The believers who had been holding on to their beliefs felt something in their hearts collapse. They were rendered speechless as they stared blankly at the live broadcast.

“Human Sovereign is invincible… Even Seraph was killed in one strike… He’s so powerful…”

“Haha, so what if it’s angels or demons? They are inferior to Human Sovereign’s sword.”

“Your Excellency Human Sovereign, why not clear the Venusian instance dungeon while you’re at it? Only you are worthy of first place.”

Everyone was overjoyed. Although most people didn’t even have the ability to fight, they could rejoice in the victory because of Human Sovereign.

In the League of Guardians, Hermit and company wore ugly expressions as they subconsciously touched their waists. They were very worried that the next time Human Sovereign’s sword slashed, it would be at their waists.

Many would be fated to suffer from insomnia tonight.
