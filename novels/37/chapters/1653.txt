Chapter 1654 Different Tunes

Zhou Wen was immediately frightened out of his wits. As he retreated with all his might, he ordered the Golden Harp to gather the strength of hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites to fend off the bee’s suona music.

However, Zhou Wen knew very well that even the power of hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites and Golden Harp couldn’t match the bee’s suona. After all, it was a power that could easily kill Heaven-level creatures.

Zhou Wen already had the resolve to kneel. All he could do was place his hopes on the Sigh of the King

However, Zhou Wen was taken aback when the suona sounded. This was because the music produced by the bee was somewhat different from the tune he had heard before.

If the tune Zhou Wen had heard previously was the beckoning of Death, one filled with grief, then the tune he was hearing now didn’t feel sad at all. It even made him feel happy.

The two extremes of music-one sad, one happy-were actually played from the same musical instrument. It was truly unbelievable.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t feel the urge to commit suicide because of the bee’s musical instrument. Although the Essence Energy in his body stirred with the music, it wasn’t the stirrings of an explosion. Instead, it was an indescribable impulse. His Essence Energy became abnormally active, but this activity didn’t cause any damage to his body.

The only difference was that Zhou Wen’s body was similarly restrained in such music. Ignoring instant transmission, even moving was extremely difficult.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t feel the force pulling him to his knees. However, on second thought, he felt that something was amiss.

If he knelt, he might be able to trigger the Sigh of the King. Now that he didn’t have to kneel, wouldn’t that mean that he couldn’t even activate the Sigh of the King? He wouldn’t even be able to use his final trump card.

As Zhou Wen was thinking, he saw the bee blowing the suona as it turned around and slowly flew in another direction.

Xiao, Jiuyang, and Zhou Wen were delighted. If this bee didn’t plan on taking their lives and just left, they could survive.

However, to their surprise, when the bee turned around and flew away, their bodies followed the bee’s flight uncontrollably.

The Golden Harp orchestrated hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites in a symphony, but it didn’t affect the tune that the bee played. After all, this was completely different from the tune from before. Zhou Wen had never heard this tune before, so it was too late to learn it now.

What does it want? Zhou Wen was alarmed and puzzled, unsure if it was a blessing or a curse.

If the bee really wanted them dead, it could just play the tune of death. There was no need to do this.

However, if the bee didn’t want to kill them, it could just release them. Why did it have to play such a strange tune?

The trio was forced to follow the bee. Due to the restrictions of the music, they could only walk on the ground and not fly.

This planet was covered with glacier faults and rubble ruins after the battle. As they walked forward, they couldn’t change their direction. They would occasionally collide with ice and rocks and even fall to the bottom of the cliff, leaving them in a sorry state. Thankfully, the three of them had strong physiques. They only looked pathetic, but they didn’t suffer much damage.

“Where do you think this bee is taking us? Don’t tell me it wants to take us to its nest and store us as food reserves?” Jiuyang said with a strange expression.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that Jiuyang’s words didn’t sound right, but on careful thought, they made sense.

The bee wasn’t the Companion Beast. It didn’t have an extremely powerful devouring ability. It wasn’t able to directly devour and digest the Companion Beast’s Calamity essence, much less devour the three of them.

It seemed reasonable to take them back and use them as food reserves. “That Holy God of yours is so resourceful; did he not leave any backup plans for you before you came?” Zhou Wen asked.

“If we had any means, we would have used them long ago. Would we have waited until now?” Xiao curled his lips and said, “However, I think this bee might not have any ill intentions towards us. At the very least, it shouldn’t have any ill intentions towards Jiuyang and me.”

Zhou Wen was even more depressed when he heard that. Xiao was right. The bee had been targeting Zhou Wen from the beginning. Xiao and Jiuyang had only been implicated.

“Zhou Wen, is there something special on you that attracted that bee?” Xiao asked Zhou Wen.

“If there’s really anything on me that it likes, do you think it won’t directly snatch it?” Zhou Wen said angrily.

Xiao thought for a moment and felt that Zhou Wen was right. If the bee really fancied something on Zhou Wen, it could just kill him and snatch it. There was no need to go through so much trouble.

“If it hasn’t taken a fancy to something, could it have taken a fancy to you?” As Xiao involuntarily walked forward, he sized up Zhou Wen from the side as though he wanted to figure out what about Zhou Wen attracted the bee.

When Jiuyang heard Xiao, he said as though he had come to a realization, “If the bee is really a Companion Beast born from this planet, then the energy of this planet was originally provided to it. Now, at least half of it has been sucked away by that Companion Beast, preventing it from completely evolving. Now, has it chosen Zhou Wen and wants to use his body for parasitization…” Zhou Wen’s face immediately turned pale when he heard that. There was a slight possibility in Jiuyang’s words.

Imagining the scene of the bee drilling into his body and slowly gnawing away at his organs, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but shiver.

“No way! In terms of physique and levels, you guys are much stronger than me. If it wants to parasitize someone, it should parasitize your bodies. It shouldn’t be me,” Zhou Wen said.

“That’s not necessarily the case. Perhaps the bee likes a talented host like you,” Xiao said.

“Talented my ass. I’m just an ordinary person…” Zhou Wen hurriedly said.

“Ordinary?” Jiuyang and Xiao looked at him sideways.

They didn’t think so. Zhou Wen’s domain power clearly hadn’t reached the Heaven’s level of perfection. It wasn’t even as complete as a Hell-level domain, but his domain power was actually able to fight a Heaven level existence. Furthermore, he had multiple domains. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

What was even more terrifying was that there was no sign of the Guardian or other creature’s genes on him. It was as though he was a pure-blooded human who had advanced to the Calamity grade.

If such a person was still called an ordinary person, they really didn’t know who else in this world was extraordinary.

As the three of them spoke, the bee had already flown into a glacier rift. The three of them couldn’t help but fall.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The three of them fell to the bottom of the rift and smashed open three ice craters. When they crawled out of the ice craters, they realized that the bee had stopped playing and was looking at an ice cavern.

Zhou Wen traced the bee’s gaze and when he saw the scene inside the ice cave, his eyes widened as his mouth gaped open. He nearly cried out.
