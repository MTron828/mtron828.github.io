Chapter 1135: Boring Movie

Translator: CKtalon

Speaking of which, Zhou Wen felt wronged. If you were to ask him how to kill dimensional creatures or which dimensional zones had which taboo, he might know something about that.

However, Zhou Wen really didn’t know what taboos to look out for when watching movies at a cinema. His knowledge of movie theaters basically came from Li Xuan’s descriptions, so how could he know much?

Li Xuan was only focused on showing off and bragging. He wouldn’t talk about the trivialities. He only talked about how he was popular with girls and how they threw themselves at him.

After passing the melon seeds and orange juice to Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to eat snacks, so he sat there resting with his eyes closed. In fact, he was thinking about how to get rid of Tsukuyomi.

Previously, after Tsukuyomi dispelled the Calamity domain, Zhou Wen had thought of escaping, but he ultimately gave up.

The main reason was that Tsukuyomi had spatial abilities. Now, Tsukuyomi had no intention of killing him. If he failed to escape and she caught him, it would probably be a situation of fighting to the death.

Furthermore, if Tsukuyomi really went berserk and the Ghost Parade erupted, too many innocent people would suffer.

If he could peacefully send Tsukuyomi away, Zhou Wen would be very happy to give it a try.

I heard from Sei Gasakai that most Calamity creatures leave Earth not long after they are born. A small portion of them vanished. No one saw where they went, but they basically never appeared on Earth again. They probably left Earth as well. Although I don’t know why Calamity creatures leave Earth, there must be some restrictions. I wonder if Tsukuyomi will be affected by this restriction? If she will be affected as well, I just need to wait until she has to leave before I call it a win, right? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

However, stalling for time was one thing. It was impossible to make Zhou Wen sacrifice himself—sexually.

As Zhou Wen was thinking about how to stall for time, Sasser, who was behind him, had a sullen expression and twitching eyes. He had the urge to murder.

Zhou Wen didn’t know the etiquette of the cinema, much less Tsukuyomi, a dimensional creature. Although she had already transformed into a human and wore human clothes, she was still a dimensional creature.

Zhou Wen was thinking while Tsukuyomi was munching on melon seeds. Although the munching sounds weren’t loud, it made Sasser feel uneasy.

“Young lady, you can’t eat melon seeds during a movie. This is basic etiquette.” Before the movie began, Sasser decided to remind them. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, Tsukuyomi ignored him. This was because in Tsukuyomi’s eyes, other than Zhou Wen, no other humans mattered. They were lifeforms that were inferior to ants. There was no need to care about their feelings.

Zhou Wen turned his head to look at Sasser and saw that it was an old man with a head full of white hair. He apologized before saying to Tsukuyomi, “Don’t eat melon seeds when watching the movie later.”

Tsukuyomi nodded slightly before putting the melon seeds aside and stopping eating.

Seeing that their attitude wasn’t bad, Sasser’s mood improved slightly. Since the movie hasn’t started, I’ll spare you for now.

Soon, the movie began. It was an old movie called The Prestige.

In fact, in recent years, all the movies that were shown in theaters were basically old movies. It wasn’t just because of nostalgia, but mainly because there were very few new movies being filmed.

Sasser knew all the details of The Prestige like the back of his hand, but he was still very engrossed every time he watched it.

The movie began. That’s when Sasser picked up his coke and popcorn and enjoyed the classic that delighted him.

However, not long after, he suddenly saw Tsukuyomi in front of him stand up and say to Zhou Wen, “Watching boring movies here is a waste of time. Let’s go.”

With that said, Tsukuyomi turned around and walked towards the exit.

Zhou Wen was delighted when he heard that. He stood up and followed Tsukuyomi.

A creature at Tsukuyomi’s level had almost infinite life. By saying that it was a waste of time, it was very likely because of some restriction she was under. Time had an extraordinary meaning to her.

This made Zhou Wen feel that his previous guess was right. Tsukuyomi had no choice but to leave Earth after a certain period of time. This was very beneficial for him.

Zhou Wen was delighted, but Sasser was about to explode from anger.

Boring movie... A waste of time... Sasser’s gaze became abnormally terrifying. It’s already unforgivable to leave early in front of such a great movie, yet you still dare...

Sasser slowly stood up. Having watched movies for so many years, this was one of the few times he had left early.

“You don’t like this movie? We can switch to another one,” Zhou Wen said as he walked alongside Tsukuyomi.

“I don’t like such boring movies,” Tsukuyomi said.

“Then what do you like?” Zhou Wen asked.

Tsukuyomi lowered her head and thought for a moment. After a while, she said, “I don’t know. Anyway, I don’t like watching movies.”

As the two of them spoke, they had already reached the entrance of the theater.

Sasser followed. Upon hearing Tsukuyomi’s words, the killing intent in his heart burned even more. Standing on the steps, his body produced a faint energy fluctuation.

You actually dare belittle a movie? Then I’ll let you have a taste of being killed by a movie. Sasser’s eyes were cold as his strength secretly condensed into a camera in his hand. He pressed the shutter button as the camera aimed at Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen.

In the next second, Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi, who had just walked down the steps of the cinema, suddenly realized that their surroundings had changed drastically.

The streets had vanished, and the entire city seemed to suddenly vanish. It was supposed to be nighttime, but the sun was shining brightly here. In front of them was a blue sea, blue sky, and a beautiful huge ship.

Blue sea, blue sky, seagulls flying.

The two of them were standing on the cruise ship. A breeze blew past them, making them feel very comfortable.

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he circulated his Essence Energy Art, but he realized that he couldn’t use it.

Not only was he unable to use Essence Energy Arts, but he couldn’t even summon Companion Beasts. He seemed to have become an ordinary person.

“Can you use your strength?” Zhou Wen asked Tsukuyomi.

Tsukuyomi shook her head slightly and said, “No.”

Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly. If even Tsukuyomi couldn’t use her powers, things had likely turned very troublesome.

Could it be that the monarchs of the dimension discovered that I wasn’t dead and wanted to kill me across dimensions? Otherwise, who would have the ability to trap Tsukuyomi? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he constantly switched Essence Energy Arts, hoping that something would be of use.

Soon, when Zhou Wen circulated the Dao Sutra, the Essence Energy that hadn’t reacted finally reacted. But it still couldn’t circulate.

However, this already delighted Zhou Wen. At critical moments, I still need to rely on the Dao Sutra. From the looks of it, we have been pulled into a domain limited by certain rules. If the Dao Sutra advances further, I might be able to break through. I wonder if my opponent will give me the time.

Zhou Wen looked around. He didn’t have the ability to resist now. It was too easy for the enemy to kill him. However, all he could see were ordinary humans.

No, it shouldn’t be said that they were ordinary humans. The humans here were much weaker than ordinary humans. They seemed to be humans who had never cultivated.
