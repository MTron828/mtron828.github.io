Chapter 1728 Immortal Sword Is Out

Four Essence Energy Arts! The woman couldn’t help but be alarmed.

To be able to cultivate four Essence Energy Arts to such a stage was rare even in the dimension. It was unimaginable for a human to cultivate to such a stage.

A pure-blooded human can actually cultivate all four Essence Energy Arts to the Calamity grade. If he can really take that step in the future, he will definitely be an extremely terrifying existence. He will be a lord of a region even in the dimension… However, the woman thought again. I’m overthinking things. How can that step be so easy to take? Ignoring the four Essence Energy Arts, it’s probably difficult to cultivate one Essence Energy Art to the extreme, much less four.

Although the woman felt that it was unlikely for Zhou Wen to take that step to reach the Apocalypse grade, the way she looked at him was somewhat different.

Even if such a person can’t take that step, he can be considered invincible on Earth. If he can be used by us Immortals, who can compete with us for Earth’s Companion Beast? The woman thought to herself. However, this person can’t be left alive no matter what. Even if he can be used by me, I have to eliminate him in the future. It’s better to be safe than sorry. If he really takes that step, I’m afraid it will be difficult to control him.

As the woman was thinking, she suddenly felt her feet shake. The entire mountain shook.

It’s out! The woman was pleasantly surprised as she saw Zhou Wen slowly pull out the sword from the stone monument.

A portion of the blade had already been pulled out, revealing a layer of rust on the sword’s exterior. There was no light at all, but there was a terrifying killing intent.

Instead of calling it killing intent, it was more precisely a bloody aura. Just the smell made one’s hair stand on end. It was as though their blood was stirring restlessly and was flowing towards the sword.

It’s indeed that sword! Only now did the woman confirm that it was the immortal sword.

The sword looked rusty, but the woman knew that it wasn’t rust, but blood-blood of an immortal, the blood of a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.

Back then, the immortal had killed countless Heaven Immortals with this sword. Even the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal stained the sword with his blood and was mercilessly slain by it.

This sword was probably the only one in the world with such a heavy bloodlust. It had a baneful aura that was fed from the blood of countless Immortals. There was only one in the world. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After Zhou Wen circulated the Dao Sutra to draw the sword, the sword seemed to respond to him. It wasn’t as motionless as before. As his palms slowly moved away from the stone monument, the aura on the sword made Zhou Wen truly feel that it was indeed a sword that was part of a set with the Immortal Culling Sword.

Although he didn’t know if it was the Immortal Peril Sword, this sword had an indescribable similarity to it.

The sword’s shape was completely different, and the aura on the sword was completely different. However, there was something deep down that was the same. How could Zhou Wen, who had been using the Immortal Culling Sword, not sense it?

As the sword was pulled out, the entire mountain shook more and more violently. Cracks also appeared on the stone monument. When the sword completely separated from the stone monument, the latter shattered.

The grass patch that was originally only a small part of the mountaintop grew crazily. In just a moment, the entire mountain peak was covered in grass. The grass continued growing at a speed visible to the naked eye.

“Give me the sword.” Upon seeing Zhou Wen pull out the immortal sword, the woman forgot her aloof way of speaking. With a flash, she appeared in front of Zhou Wen and reached out to grab the immortal sword in his hand.

Zhou Wen held the immortal sword and felt the power surge like an ocean or a volcano that was about to erupt. It seemed to contain infinite power. It was a power that was filled with baneful aura, making killing intent rise in him.

Looking at the woman who was attempting to grab the immortal sword, Zhou Wen held the hilt with both hands and slashed down at her.

As Zhou Wen brandished the dim sword, it seemed to transform into a sanguine beam that instantly slashed at the woman.

“You’re tempting fate!” the woman shouted coldly as an Essence Energy sword beam erupted from her hand.

The omnipresent sword beams instantly enveloped Zhou Wen and the immortal sword.

Zhou Wen ignored the sword beams that approached him as he continued slashing at the woman with the immortal sword. At the same time, his body was enveloped by Great Brahma armor.

Crack!

The immortal sword slashed apart the Nihility Sword Aura that could suppress the Yin Yang Rainbow Divine Light, leaving a diagonal bloody mark on the woman’s face, from her left forehead to the right of her chin.

What a powerful sword! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. The power of the sword was stronger than he imagined.

It was clearly a set of swords, but this immortal sword was much stronger than Immortal Culling. It made Zhou Wen suspect that his Immortal Culling Sword was really one of the four Immortal Vanquishing Swords, or was it just a replica.

In fact, Zhou Wen was reading too much into it. The Immortal Culling Sword was naturally not a replica. The Immortal Culling Sword wasn’t stronger than the Immortal Peril Sword either. The reason he felt that the Immortal Peril Sword was stronger was that its former owner had killed countless Immortals. Even a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal had been slain by the sword. The sword had absorbed the blood of countless Immortals, forming a baneful aura that made it even more effective against Immortals than the Immortal Culling Sword.

As expected of the sword that slew all Immortals. It’s stained with the blood of countless Immortals. This sword naturally has an extremely powerful restraining effect on Immortals. Even a mortal with this sword can slice through an Immortal’s body. Even I’m no exception. The woman stood far away and stared at the immortal sword in Zhou Wen’s hand, but she didn’t attack again.

I don’t know how long it’s been since I’ve been injured. The woman reached out to stroke the sword gash on her face. She didn’t seem angry. Instead, she seemed to be recalling something.

“From the looks of it, this sword doesn’t seem compatible with you. It’s best I take it with me to prevent it from bringing you a bloody calamity.” Zhou Wen stared intently at the woman.

He wasn’t smug that his strike had injured the woman. In that situation, the woman was completely caught off guard. She only reacted at the last minute after the sword beam was destroyed. Yet, she could still dodge the strike that even Zhou Wen believed was fatal. Such speed wasn’t something Zhou Wen could match.

“Do you think you can really injure me with a sword?” The woman looked at Zhou Wen and said indifferently, “You still have a chance now. Hand the sword to me and swear to become the representative of my Immortals. I can let bygones be bygones.”

“We will only know if I can injure you after trying.” How could Zhou Wen give up the immortal sword he had obtained?

Ignoring the fact that Zhou Wen didn’t have such plans to begin with, even if he had such plans in the past, he would probably be tempted when he saw the immortal sword’s might.

“I hope you won’t regret it.” The woman slowly raised her hand. The Nihility Sword Aura on her body condensed again, but the sword beam became fainter and fainter. In the end, one couldn’t sense the existence of the sword beams at all.

Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he instinctively summoned the Chaos Egg to protect himself.
