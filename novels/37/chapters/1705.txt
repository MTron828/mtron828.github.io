Chapter 1706 Gold Turtle In Hand

Pata’s flaunting of the Anasrava Gold Turtle in front of Zhou Wen was equivalent to delivering gifts to his doorstep. Regardless of whether the Anasrava Gold Turtle was one of the three Companion Beasts from Small Buddha Temple, Companion Beasts that had the ability to withstand taboo powers were extremely rare. There was no reason for him not to take it.

Pata clearly didn’t think so. Over the years, he had been traveling everywhere and had entered countless dangerous dimensional zones. The miraculous performance of the Anasrava Gold Turtle kept boosting his confidence. He was very certain that no one could control him as long as he wore the Anasrava Gold Turtle armor.

Furthermore, he had an instant transmission Companion Beast on him. He could instantly escape far away. With the help of the Anasrava Gold Turtle, Pata was completely confident that he could leave safely, so he was rather fearless.

Seeing Zhou Wen extend his palm and strike at him, Pata didn’t sense that his strength was affected by a taboo power at all. He imagined that Zhou Wen’s taboo power was indeed useless against him.

“I’ll let you see what an excellent-grade Companion Beast is.” Pata wasn’t in a rush to teleport away. He still wanted to show Zhou Wen and company how powerful the Anasrava Gold Turtle was.

From his point of view, even if Zhou Wen was at the Calamity grade, it was impossible for him to break through the defense of the Hell-level Anasrava Gold Turtle. Taking one step back, even if Zhou Wen could crack it, it was impossible for him to kill him with one strike.

Apart from Human Sovereign’s fantastic Companion Beast, Pata wasn’t afraid of anyone on Earth. Even if the powerful Karoman fought him, he would dare stand still and receive three punches from him.

Of course, the reason Pata did so was mainly because he hoped to let Zhou Wen understand how powerful the Anasrava Gold Turtle was, compelling him to make a deal with him. After all, the benefits he could obtain from lending a Companion Beast to Karoman were limited. 30% of Guide Ancient City’s future profits was a huge benefit that would be a constant stream of income.

“Come on, I’ll stand here and let you hit me. I’ll let you see what a true top-notch defensive Companion Beast is.” Pata straightened his back and stood proudly in his spot as though he thought nothing of him. He looked rather imposing. Zhou Wen slapped Pata, but it didn’t hurt at all. Pata was still feeling smug inwardly. Deceit King is nothing much after all. After all, he’s only an expert in the era without representatives. Compared to the present representatives, he’s still not strong enough. If not for the taboo power that can restrain Karoman, Guide Ancient City would have long been destroyed by him. Perfect. I’m the one reaping in all the profits. Is 30% of the profits too little? That’s right. You just slapped me. Now if you want my help, 30% isn’t enough to resolve the problem. At least 40%… No… 50%…

Pata was still fantasizing of how Zhou Wen and company pleaded with him in horror, hoping that he wouldn’t lend his Companion Beast to Karoman.

As he was thinking, Pata suddenly felt a chill run down his body. It was similar to being suddenly stripped naked and thrown into the snow in winter.

A little cold? Zhou Wen has ice-elemental power? This cold aura is useless against me… Just as Pata was thinking, he suddenly felt that something was amiss. He couldn’t sense the Anasrava Gold Turtle’s consciousness.

No… Impossible… Pata thought of a possibility, but he couldn’t accept it mentally. Or rather, he wasn’t willing to accept it at all.

Looking down at his body, he was alarmed to discover that the golden armor on his body had vanished, leaving only the clothes he usually wore.

Anasrava Gold Turtle… Where’s the Anasrava Gold Turtle… Pata couldn’t accept it at all. He summoned the Anasrava Gold Turtle repeatedly, but there was no reaction.

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised because he had started with Universe Inversion to steal the Anasrava Gold Turtle over. However, to his surprise, the power of Universe Inversion didn’t take effect immediately.

It was unknown if it was because Universe Inversion was only at the Human Realm and couldn’t steal a Hell-level Companion Beast or if it was because the power of the Anasrava Gold Turtle was so crazy that it could even withstand the power of the Universe Inversion.

In the next second, Zhou Wen activated the Teacher Domain, hoping to figure out what kind of rules the Anasrava Gold Turtle used. To his surprise, the originally useless Universe Inversion under the Teacher Domain became effective and successfully stole the Anasrava Gold Turtle.

Zhou Wen could only slowly study the principle in the future.

Zhou Wen’s series of actions gave Pata time to fantasize. This was also how he experienced the two extremes of heaven and hell in such a short period of time.

“You… What did you do to me…” Pata looked at Zhou Wen with a look of horror. Up to now, he still wasn’t willing to believe that the Anasrava Gold Turtle was gone. He still hoped that the Anasrava Gold Turtle had been sealed by Zhou Wen using some taboo power.

It was no wonder Pata wasn’t willing to believe it. The reason he had his present achievements and status was basically because of the Anasrava Gold Turtle. Once he lost the Anasrava Gold Turtle, most of his strength would be gone. “After hearing you extol the virtues of the Anasrava Gold Turtle so much, I decided to take it for a spin.” Zhou Wen extended his hand and the Anasrava Gold Turtle appeared in front of him. Its golden body was motionless like a statue.

“Take it for a spin?” For a moment, Pata felt his brain lacking oxygen as it instantly went blank.

“You… You… You… Return the Anasrava Gold Turtle to me…” Pata was overwhelmed by anxiety and was momentarily at a loss for words. When he snapped to his senses, he hurriedly added,” Mr. Zhou, it’s all my fault. I was just joking with you. On account of Lance, please return the Anasrava Gold Turtle to me. I’ll leave immediately and guarantee that I won’t lend it to Karoman… No… Karoman is nothing… You aren’t even bothered by him… If you have any requests in the future, I’ll definitely be at your beck and call…”

Li Xuan nearly burst out laughing. “Didn’t you ask around about Zhou Wen’s nickname before you came? Do you think the nickname Deceit King was for nothing? Have you heard of a thief not leaving empty-handed? Besides, you came knocking on our door. Now, you want it back? Are you still dreaming?”

“On account of Lance and the Ultimate Family Clan, I’ll spare your life. Go,” Zhou Wen said casually. “I….” Pata didn’t give up. The Anasrava Gold Turtle was everything to him. He was about to go crazy. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Why? Do you still want to leave your life here?” Li Xuan interrupted him coldly.

Pata’s heart chilled as he realized that without the protection of the Anasrava Gold Turtle, he wasn’t absolutely safe. If Zhou Wen and company really wanted to kill him, he might not have a chance of escaping.

Pata steeled his heart and flew away. No one stopped him, allowing him to successfully leave Guide Ancient City.

Zhou Wen had indeed released him on account of Lance. Otherwise, how could he have let him walk out of Guide Ancient City alive?

After Pata left Guide Ancient City, his mind became adrift as though he was dreaming.
