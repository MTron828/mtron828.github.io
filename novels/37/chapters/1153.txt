Chapter 1154: Singularity Universe

Boundless Wind swept toward the Planet Devourer, but it was unable to blow it away.

Its body was like a black hole. No matter what kind of force surged at it, it would be swallowed into the black hole. This had nothing to do with the strength of the force. This was the characteristic of the Planet Devourer.

Zhou Wen felt a headache come on. A dimensional creature with a black hole body couldn’t be injured by typical forces. It would be useless no matter how powerful the attack was.

No wonder it can devour planets... Zhou Wen could only teleport with Banana Fairy to dodge the Planet Devourer’s suction as he pondered over a solution to kill it.

The Planet Devourer was also spatially powerful. It constantly teleported with Zhou Wen, hoping to devour him.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen, who was wearing Clown Mask, could teleport infinitely. The Planet Devourer couldn’t catch up to him.

With a thought, Zhou Wen teleported to a tiny planet. After the Planet Devourer teleported over, it devoured the tiny planet. Zhou Wen took this opportunity to teleport to another tiny planet.

Zhou Wen thought that since the Planet Devourer was a dimensional creature, surely it couldn’t devour matter indefinitely. Therefore, if he could use these small planets to “feed” it, he might have a chance of finishing it off.

However, Zhou Wen soon realized that his idea was ridiculously wrong. After the Planet Devourer devoured the tiny planet, not only did it not show any signs of being ‘satiated,’ but the range and suction force of the black hole increased.

Only then did Zhou Wen realize that he was backwards in his thinking. The more matter the Planet Devourer devoured, the stronger it became. It didn’t seem like satiation was possible.

Since I can’t satiate it, I’ll starve it to death.

With a thought, Zhou Wen teleported to a spot where there were fewer planets.

Teleportation required a large amount of Essence Energy. With the massive size of the Planet Devourer, the energy expended from teleportation was even more terrifying. After repeated teleportations, Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the Planet Devourer’s black hole had weakened significantly. The suction range and strength were shrinking.

It’s indeed effective! Zhou Wen was delighted as he continued wandering the Endless Sea of Stars with the Planet Devourer.

The Planet Devourer had expended quite a bit of energy. It suddenly stopped chasing after Zhou Wen and instead rushed towards a small, nearby planet. Clearly, it wanted to devour the small planet to replenish its energy.

Zhou Wen naturally couldn’t let it do as it wished. He teleported to the tiny planet. The Clown Mask on his face emitted a strange aura as the surrounding space distorted.

Zhou Wen pressed his palm on the tiny planet, hoping to teleport it away.

Unfortunately, he quickly realized that although the Clown Mask was powerful spatially, it was still too difficult to teleport a small planet far away.

Before Zhou Wen could successfully teleport the tiny planet, the Planet Devourer had already devoured it. All Zhou Wen could do was teleport away.

It doesn’t seem realistic to forcefully teleport planets away, but what if I use the teleportation ability of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art? Zhou Wen didn’t give up on his plan as he thought of a way to achieve his goal.

Zhou Wen circulated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art and engraved it on the Wheel of Destiny. It was a point, the Universe’s singularity.

The singularity was the beginning of the universe, as well as the eternity of the universe. It looked like a point, but inside, it seemed to be a pocket universe with countless stars revolving.

Back when Zhou Wen condensed the Singularity Life Soul, he had already begun advancing to the Mythical stage. He hadn’t had much time to study the ability of this Life Soul then.

After being trapped for five years, his mind had experienced more than a hundred years. Over the long years, Zhou Wen had gained a deep understanding of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art and Singularity.

However, research was ultimately research. As he was trapped, he could only think about it without completing any verification. Therefore, Zhou Wen didn’t know if he was right. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Now, in the Endless Sea of Stars, Zhou Wen could test his ideas.

With the power of Singularity Universe, Zhou Wen could freely traverse the tiny planets in the Endless Sea of Stars. However, he could only locate the tiny planets. He couldn’t teleport easily like when he was using Clown Mask, but the teleportation distance was much further.

Zhou Wen landed on a tiny planet and attempted to use the power of Singularity Universe to teleport the tiny planet to another location.

However, the outcome wasn’t that instantaneous. Although the star corresponding to the tiny planet in the Singularity Universe kept flickering, there was no movement.

The Planet Devourer had already caught up to him. Zhou Wen had no choice but to give up on the idea of teleporting the planet. He teleported to another planet.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t totally give up. He continued trying again and again, believing that he would succeed.

Since this Essence Energy Art is called Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, there’s no reason why it can’t shift a tiny planet... Sun-Swapping... Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as his eyes lit up.

He tried again, but this time, he didn’t just want to teleport this small planet. He wanted to swap it with another small planet.

In the Singularity Universe, two stars lit up. As the hands Zhou Wen used to press down on the tiny planet produced spatial fluctuations, the entire planet seemed to be affected.

Boom!

A powerful spatial energy fluctuation exploded from Singularity Universe, as though a universe had undergone a Big Bang. It instantly produced a strange pocket universe phantom that fused with Zhou Wen’s body, giving him a strange feeling that the universe was him and he was the universe.

In the next second, an unbelievable thing happened. Spatial energy suddenly erupted. Then, the tiny planet under Zhou Wen’s hands, with its main body composed of metal, instantly turned into a tiny stone planet. It was the one Zhou Wen had chosen to exchange with.

Holy sh*t, it really works. Then can I exchange Earth with other planets in real life? Let Earth leave the Milky Way? Zhou Wen imagined himself traveling with Earth in the universe.

However, on careful thought, it probably wasn’t that easy.

When the Singularity Universe advanced to the Terror grade, it could only move such a tiny planet. The size of a small planet was about the size of a mountain. It was far inferior to Earth. It was probably not that easy to swap it with a real planet.

Furthermore, there were so many terrifying creatures and dimensional zones on Earth. It was impossible to teleport with so many terrifying things on it without expending energy.

Zhou Wen glanced at the blood-colored avatar’s stats and realized that the Terror transformation condensed by the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art was called Singularity Universe. It was also an S-grade Terror transformation.

Up to now, Zhou Wen had already condensed four S-grade Terror forms of Great Brahma, Godfiend Era, Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, and Singularity Universe. However, his level was still at the Mythical stage, and his stats hadn’t exceeded 81.
