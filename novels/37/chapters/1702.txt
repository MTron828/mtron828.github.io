Chapter 1703 Anasrava Gold Turtle

Karoman turned around and left without saying a word.

“Why did he leave just like that?” Many of the people watching the battle on the wall were puzzled. They could only tell that Karoman and Ming Xiu had fought to a draw. Then, after Zhou Wen said a few words, he left. It was baffling

Leaving just like that? How boring. Zhou Wen felt a little stilted. He was using the Teacher Domain to analyze Ming Xiu’s Tomorrow Sword Art. If no one fought Ming Xiu after Karoman left, what was there to analyze?

“Coach, don’t do a thing next time. Otherwise, it will be too boring,” Ming Xiu said with a smile.

“If you find it boring, why don’t you fight me?” Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up when he heard Ming Xiu say that.

Ming Xiu’s situation was somewhat similar to Honn Shinsakura’s. If he could use the Teacher Domain to help Ming Xiu grow, the Teacher Domain might be able to advance again and reach the highest level of Heaven. “It’s naturally best if you’re willing to give me pointers.” Ming Xiu’s eyes lit up when he heard Zhou Wen. Having been in the dimension for so long, he wanted to know how much he had improved.

“We’ll talk when we get back,” Zhou Wen said as he walked into the city.

It wasn’t like he was fighting an outsider. There was no need for Ming Xiu to expose all his abilities. It was better to find a secret place to fight Ming Xiu.

After Karoman left, the more he thought about it, the more upset he felt. He guessed that Zhou Wen had a power that could restrain his Sun God power, just like how the long steps in front of the Alkaid Star Palace could eliminate Essence Energy-like powers. If I had known, I wouldn’t have returned the Anasrava Gold Turtle so early. Karoman didn’t believe that he was weaker than Zhou Wenit was only because Zhou Wen had a special ability that restrained his Sun God power. As long as he could crack that special ability, defeating Zhou Wen wouldn’t be difficult.

The Anasrava Gold Turtle was the Companion Beast he had used to clear the Alkaid Star Palace’s long flight of stairs. It transformed into golden armor to protect his body, allowing him to withstand the taboo power of the staircase.

Karoman felt that Zhou Wen’s power was similar to the staircase’s powers. The Anasrava Gold Turtle was likely effective against him. As long as he wore the Anasrava Gold Turtle armor and went to Guide City, he wouldn’t need to cower. He would definitely be able to defeat Zhou Wen and Ming Xiu.

However, the Anasrava Gold Turtle wasn’t his Companion Beast. He had only borrowed it. If he wanted to borrow it again, it would take at least half a month to borrow and then return it. Furthermore, he had to pay a price.

Karoman didn’t mind paying a price, but he couldn’t afford to wait.

Ever since he became a representative, he had never suffered such a huge setback. He couldn’t wait to defeat Zhou Wen to redeem his pride.

After some thought, he took out his phone and called a number. The call quickly connected.

“Pata, lend me your Anasrava Gold Turtle again.” Karoman directly revealed his intentions.

“Why? Do you still want to challenge the Star Palace? I advise you to give up. According to the information I obtained, Starlady Polestar should be at the Heaven level. Apart from Human Sovereign, I’m afraid no one else among the humans can match her. You will only be sending yourself to your death. It’s none of my business if you send yourself to your death, but the Anasrava Gold Turtle I lend you won’t be able to return. I’m not participating in this deal.” Pata’s words left Karoman even more depressed.

The Cube’s ranking was dominated by Human Sovereign, and he had been taught a lesson by Zhou Wen in Guide Ancient City. With Karoman’s arrogant personality, there was nothing that made him feel worse than this.

“I’m not going to the Star Palace,” said Karoman.

“Where are you going?” Pata was somewhat surprised. With the abilities of Karoman, even without the Anasrava Gold Turtle, there weren’t many humans on Earth who could match him.

“If I want to defeat someone, I need to use the power of the Anasrava Gold Turtle.” “Who? Don’t tell me it’s Human Sovereign?” Karoman’s words surprised Pata. Who else on Earth could make Karoman so afraid? He even needed to borrow his Anasrava Gold Turtle.

“Guide Ancient City’s Zhou Wen has a special power that can eliminate my Sun God power. I need the Anasrava Gold Turtle to resist it.” Karoman didn’t hide anything as he recounted the matter.

“What a coincidence. I happen to be heading to Guide Ancient City as well. I’ll be there in at most half a day.” After a pause, Pata continued, “The Anasrava Gold Turtle is the nemesis of those taboo powers. It will definitely be able to help you, but in terms of price…”

“The same old,” Karoman immediately said in delight, having never expected that Pata would come to the vicinity of Guide Ancient City as well.

“Don’t be anxious. Let me think about it again. Let’s chat when we meet.” After agreeing on a time, Pata hung up. However, it was different from what Pata had said. He was almost at Guide Ancient City and didn’t need half a day.

After taking a look at Guide Ancient City, Pata walked straight towards it.

“Brother, please help me pass the message that the Ultimate Family Clan’s Pata is requesting an audience with City Lord Zhou Wen,” Pata said to the guard with a grin when he arrived at the city gates.

When the guard heard that he was from the Ultimate Family Clan, he didn’t dare take his time. He hurriedly got someone to report to Zhou Wen.

“What have we done recently? Why is there always someone knocking on our door? First it was the Cape family’s Karoman, and now, there’s the Ultimate Family Clan’s Pata,” Li Xuan said languidly after hearing the news.

He wasn’t afraid of trouble, but it would be troublesome if there were too many problems.

“Take him to the meeting hall.” Zhou Wen was about to fight Ming Xiu, so he could only put it aside for now.

The Ultimate Family Clan had a good relationship with him. Lance and Sadie were his friends, so it wasn’t appropriate for him to slight the members of the Ultimate Family Clan.

When Zhou Wen saw Pata in the meeting hall, he was first taken aback.

In Zhou Wen’s impression, the Ultimate Family Clan had handsome men and beautiful women with long legs. Lance could be said to be the most handsome man in the world, and Sadie was also a beauty among beauties. Her long legs were straight and snow-white, dazzling.

However, Pata was short and stout. He was probably only about 1.6 meters tall. His eyes were small, with even smaller irises, and his green bean-like irises darted around in his eyes. Together with the sparse hair on his head, he looked like a bald rat. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

This was too different from the handsome men and beautiful women of the Ultimate Family Clan in Zhou Wen’s impression. He couldn’t help but take a second look.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t someone who judged a book by its cover. He said politely, “Welcome to Guide Ancient City. Lance, Sadie, and I are friends. If you need any help, there’s no need to stand on ceremony with me. You will definitely be welcomed with the highest standard.”

“Thank you very much, but I’m not here on holiday. I want to make a deal with you,” said Pata with a smile.

“What deal?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.

“Since you are friends with Lance, I won’t beat around the bush. You have a taboo power that counters the Sun God power, right?” Pata said bluntly.

“Sort of. Is this related to the deal?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I have a Companion Beast that can restrain your powers. Now, Karoman wants to use my Companion Beast to deal with you,” said Pata with a smile. “I can choose not to lend it to him, but the condition is that I’ll take a third of Guide Ancient City’s future profits.”
