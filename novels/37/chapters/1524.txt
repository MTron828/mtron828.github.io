Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. He never expected Demonic Neonate to be so useful. These three devils were likely existences at the Hell level. It was truly surprising that they were so afraid of the Mythical Demonic Neonate.

Hum!

The red devil released its claw and the Golden Wyrm Scissors returned to Zhou Wen’s hand.

With the Golden Wyrm Scissors in hand, Zhou Wen regained some of his confidence. He stood behind Demonic Neonate and sized up the three trembling devils who were prostrating on the ground.

From their present state, it was difficult to imagine that they were Hell-level existences.

Demonic Neonate reached out to grab the hilt of the Demonic Sword, but she didn’t pull it out. Together with the scabbard, she slammed it on the red devil’s head.

The red devil didn’t dare move. It allowed Demonic Neonate to smash it a few times, but it still lay there, not daring to resist.

After hitting it a few times, Demonic Neonate seemed to be appeased. Only then did she retract the Demonic Sword and hug it in her arms again. She floated in the air and looked around for a while.

“Over there.” Demonic Neonate landed on Zhou Wen’s shoulder and pointed in a direction. Clearly, she wanted Zhou Wen to head over.

“What’s there?” Zhou Wen asked curiously as he walked.

“I don’t know.” Demonic Neonate shook her head.

Zhou Wen wore an odd expression, but at that moment, he could only listen to Demonic Neonate and fly over.

The three devils didn’t dare get up. They were like monkeys on all fours as they crawled behind Zhou Wen. They didn’t dare get too close, nor did they dare stay too far. They looked very nervous and awkward. “Neonate, do you know where this is?” Zhou Wen asked Demonic Neonate again.

Demonic Neonate shook her head again. This time, she didn’t even say a word.

That’s true. Demonic Neonate was originally a muddle-headed toddler. After I killed her, she was absorbed by the Dead Man Tree and reborn as a Companion Beast. She no longer has her former memories. Even if she knew where this place was in the past, she shouldn’t know now. Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he said to Demonic Neonate, “Neonate, release Grim Demon. I have something to ask him.”

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Demonic Neonate automatically unsheathed the Demonic Sword in her arms. A demonic aura surged out and quickly transformed into Grim Demon.

“Boohoo, I’m finally out. The air outside is so sweet…” After Grim Demon came out, he greedily took a breath, so excited that he was on the brink of tears.

“Ah!” When Grim Demon saw the three devils behind him, he was immediately given a fright. He flew backward and was about to escape into the Demonic Sword.

Bang!

Demonic Neonate struck him on the head with the sword, knocking Grim Demon to the ground.

Grim Demon got up from the ground as though his mind had cleared up. He stood up and shouted majestically at the three devils, “Three puny devils. How dare you act so presumptuously in front of your Grandpa Grim Demon? Quickly kneel down and apologize to me.”

The three devils ignored him and only looked at Demonic Neonate’s expression from afar.

“Cut the crap. Grim Demon, do you know where this is?” Zhou Wen said with a frown.

“What else could it be? Of course it’s the territory of the Devils. Why are you here? Why did you come to the dimension for no reason? Do you think you’ve lived too long? Isn’t it nice to live a comfortable life? Thankfully, this is a place for the Devils. With my lady here, she can protect you. If you were anywhere else, you would have been chopped up countless times. It’s fine if you die, but don’t implicate my lady…” Grim Demon shouted unhappily. Zhou Wen thought to himself, Do you think I want to come to this crappy place? I was forcefully sent in here, alright!?

“You said that this is the dimension? Then why don’t I sense the dimension’s laws suppressing me?” The last time Zhou Wen came to the dimension, he couldn’t see anything. Everything around him seemed distorted and abstract. Furthermore, there was a huge pressure, but that didn’t exist here.

“It’s different here.” Grim Demon looked at the surrounding sea of flowers and said with a strange expression, “If I’m not wrong, this should be the Land of the Fallen.”

“Land of the Fallen?” Zhou Wen had never heard of such a place.

“Haven’t you heard of the myths and legends of the fallen angels from the West District?” Grim Demon frowned.

“Are you talking about Satan or Lucifer?” Zhou Wen knew that there were actually several versions of the Fallen Angel. He knew more about Satan and Lucifer’s versions. Some people also said that Satan was Lucifer.

Satan, the lord of all evil, originally lived in Heaven, but due to his defeat in the war with God, he was banished to hell.

Legend had it that Lucifer was an angel, and he was the angel closest to God. Later, God created the progenitor of humanity, Adam, and named him the Messiah. He requested angels to kneel and worship Adam.

Michael and the other angels followed God’s orders and knelt in front of Adam. Only Lucifer didn’t kneel.

Lucifer believed that angels had lost their freedom by serving God. If they knelt before humans again, even their dignity and pride would be lost. Therefore, he refused to kneel before Adam.

The angels behind Lucifer also refused to kneel to Adam. They abandoned their faith and fear and plucked up their courage to fight God. Although they were ultimately defeated and banished to hell, Lucifer became synonymous with the terms pride and dignity. He was also the King of Hell.

“Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven”—this was Lucifer’s famous saying.

Of course, there were also people who said that Satan and Lucifer were the same person. There were also various versions of legends that Zhou Wen didn’t understand in detail. That was all he knew.

“In fact, I’ve never been to the dimension’s Land of the Fallen, nor do I know if Satan and Lucifer are the same person. However, in the divine wars during Earth’s mythical era, there were once fallen angels and demons participating in the battle. One of the fallen angels was extremely terrifying. Under the suppression of Earth’s rules, it still killed countless deities. As it was dyed with too much divine blood, its pure white feathers were dyed black by layers of blood. It was one of the few existences that could barely match me…”

After a pause, Grim Demon continued, “I heard them say that they come from the Land of the Fallen. It’s a place of imprisonment that grants them immortality. There are endless flowers that never wither. It represents eternal life, but it also represents eternal damnation.”

“Since the Land of the Fallen is the territory of the fallen angels, it shouldn’t be the same place as yours, right? Why are these devils afraid of Neonate?” Zhou Wen stared at Grim Demon and asked. Grim Demon clearly knew something about Demonic Neonate.

Grim Demon looked at Zhou Wen in contempt and said, “Don’t use your narrow and ignorant standards to measure my lady. Ignoring mere devils, even…”

As though realizing that he had said too much, Grim Demon changed the topic and said, “However, in my lady’s present state, it’s best not to let those terrifying fellows see her. It will be troublesome if she’s recognized. Why did you come here for no reason? Are you courting death?”
