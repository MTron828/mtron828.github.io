Chapter 956: Defective Guardian

Translator: CKtalon

Just as Li Xuan’s carapace was being repaired, a strange scene suddenly ensued. Tiny specks of dust appeared where his carapace shattered. The specks of dust mixed into the carapace and fused with it, allowing the carapace to recover faster.

However, the repaired carapace was somewhat different from the other intact parts of the carapace. It suffused a strange metallic luster as though it was mixed with metallic granules.

“This is... That Guardian... What does it want? Don’t tell me it wants to occupy my body?” Li Xuan was given a fright.

“It chose to use the drop of blood from before to contract with you, allowing it to escape death,” the black-robed Chess Soul floated over and said to Li Xuan.

“Isn’t it said that a contract needs both parties to agree? Why don’t I feel anything?” Li Xuan asked with a frown.

“The Guardian contract naturally requires both parties to agree. However, under such circumstances, it no longer has the time to wait for your agreement. Therefore, it chose a method that doesn’t require your agreement,” said the black-robed Chess Soul.

“Isn’t this forcing himself on me?” Li Xuan looked at the extremely patchy carapace on his body.

The metallic parts looked like patches. It looked ugly.

The black-robed Chess Soul said with a strange expression, “Usually, both parties have the right to terminate a Guardian contract at any time. However, under the present circumstances, the Guardian has made a huge sacrifice. Unless you are willing, it’s impossible for it to terminate the contract with you. If you die, it dies. It can be said that you have absolute dominance.”

“It sounds pretty good, but isn’t this a little too ugly?” Li Xuan still didn’t like the appearance of the carapace. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s fine. It will continue fusing with your carapace. In the future, when your carapace is shattered and reconstructed, everything will become uniform. Perhaps you can wait a little while longer. It’s still injured and has little remaining strength. It won’t be able to fuse completely. After it recovers, even if your carapace isn’t shattered, it will completely fuse with it. When that happens, it will contact you,” the black-robed Chess Soul continued.

“Since it has come to this, it looks like I can’t reject it. I’ll reluctantly accept it. By the way, what’s the name of this Guardian?” Li Xuan asked the black-robed Chess Soul.

“Alpha.” The black-robed Chess Soul said its name.

However, even if he didn’t say it, Alpha would directly communicate with Li Xuan after it recovered some energy.

Zhou Wen listened from the side, unsure if he should congratulate Li Xuan for his good luck or feel sorry for him.

His Life Soul was problematic to begin with. Now, he had contracted a heavily injured Guardian. Furthermore, it was some unknown contract that allowed the Guardian to fuse with his problematic Life Soul. He didn’t know what would happen in the future.

“Thank you for your help. Alpha’s mutation has exceeded my expectations. If it weren’t for you, I’m afraid I would have been defeated,” the black-robed Chess Soul said to Zhou Wen.

“Why did you want to destroy it?” Zhou Wen asked.

The black-robed Chess Soul hesitated for a moment before saying, “As you know, the place Alpha and I should preside over should be a dimensional zone in the West District. Although the two dimensional zones are both Chinese chess dimensional zones, the rules are completely different. It was because of an accident that Alpha and I came here. This accident was caused by Alpha itself. It had a problem and lost control. It’s a defective product that can’t represent our race. In addition, after it came to Mt. Chinese Chess and absorbed the powers here, its problems worsened. It’s impossible for it to represent our race, so I can only choose to destroy it.”

Zhou Wen’s expression turned even odder when he heard that. Not only did Li Xuan have a problematic Life Soul, but he also had a highly problematic Guardian. Who knew if anything would happen to him in the future?

“Please accept this. I’ll be heading to the West District. If you come to the West District in the future, you can take this to the Black and White Chess Country’s dimensional zone. I’m willing to guide you and contract my race’s new Guardian.” The black-robed Chess Soul handed something to Zhou Wen.

It was a white chess piece that looked like a King in international chess.

“I’ll visit when I have the chance, but I can’t guarantee you that I’ll be contracting the Guardian.” Zhou Wen accepted the chess piece.

“My race’s Guardian is very compatible with your attributes. If you can fuse together, you will definitely be invincible in the present era. I hope you can consider it carefully. I’ll wait for your answer in the Black and White Chess Country.” As the black-robed Chess Soul spoke, it bowed slightly and left Mt. Chinese Chess.

The group continued on their way and soon left Mt Chinese Chess’s dimensional zone. Zhou Wen searched the entire way, but he unfortunately failed to find the tiny palm symbol.

Zhou Wen didn’t take the black-robed Chess Soul’s words to heart. The black-robed Chess Soul only said what he had said because he saw how powerful his Companion Beasts were. Zhou Wen was certain that he didn’t even know what attributes he had or what Essence Energy Art he cultivated.

Ignoring the fact that Zhou Wen didn’t plan on contracting a Guardian, even if he really wanted to, he wouldn’t choose a Guardian of the Black and White Chess Country.

However, if there was a chance, he could head to the Black and White Chess Country to take a look. Perhaps there would be a tiny palm symbol. It would be nice to download an instance dungeon.

Over the next few days, they didn’t have any accidents. Occasionally, dimensional creatures would appear, but their levels weren’t high. They could be easily dealt with.

However, for some reason, Feng Qiuyan spoke even less along the way.

Zhou Wen thought that it was because of his nostalgia for his hometown, but Li Xuan could read a little of Feng Qiuyan’s mind. However, it wasn’t convenient for him to say anything.

While having a break one day, Feng Qiuyan suddenly came to Zhou Wen’s side and asked with a solemn expression, “Coach, can I ask you a question?”

“Just ask it directly. Why are you standing on ceremony with me?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

Feng Qiuyan looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Coach, you don’t plan on contracting a Guardian, right?”

“Not at the moment,” Zhou Wen answered.

“But if you don’t contract a Guardian, a Perfect Body Life Soul is already the final destination for humanity. How do we proceed from there?” Feng Qiuyan asked.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback. He didn’t immediately answer. He planned on using the Lost Immortal Sutra to advance to the Mythical stage, but Feng Qiuyan had never cultivated the Lost Immortal Sutra. It seemed impossible for him to rely on his own strength to advance to the Mythical stage.

“Currently, humans have confirmed that there are two ways to advance to the Mythical stage. One is to fuse with a Guardian and transform oneself like my teacher, Wang Mingyuan. This way, a human’s body can break through its limits without the restrictions of being unable to advance to the Mythical stage. The other way is to contract with a Guardian and use the Guardian’s power to advance to the Mythical stage. However, this advancement is only the advancement of a Guardian. One’s body won’t become stronger.” Zhou Wen wasn’t a true coach, so he couldn’t decide which path Feng Qiuyan should take.

“Coach, which path are you taking? The first one?” Feng Qiuyan asked.

“Neither. I want to rely on my own strength to advance to the Mythical stage. However, this path is basically a dead end,” Zhou Wen answered.
