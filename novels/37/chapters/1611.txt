Chapter 1612: Shatter!

Translator: CKtalon

“Whether there’s a Holy Artifact or not has nothing to do with my sense of superiority.” Xiao’s figure shook like a wandering soul as he suddenly appeared in front of Liu Yun, his nose just inches from Liu Yun’s nose.

Liu Yun was alarmed. It was too late for him to instant transmit. The Taiji Symbol that had just released its power in another direction couldn’t be returned immediately.

Bang!

Xiao punched Liu Yun’s abdomen, bending his body immediately like a shrimp before sending him flying.

Thankfully, he had already donned Companion Beast armor. The armor seemed to provide good defence; Xiao’s punch only shattered the armor protecting his abdomen.

Before Liu Yun could stop flying, Xiao had already flashed above his head. His leg was like a saber as he chopped down at Liu Yun’s head.

Liu Yun tried his best to control his body as he waved his hand and shone the Taiji Symbol at Xiao.

However, in the next second, Liu Yun was alarmed to discover that Xiao, who had clearly chopped down with his leg, seemed to undergo spatial dislocation.

The Taiji Symbol hit nothing, but Xiao’s leg struck his chest, shattering Liu Yun’s armor. The bones in his chest seemed to crack as his body was sent smashing into the ground.

Liu Yun’s body blasted a huge crater in the ground and rocks. The rocks were still splattering, but before Liu Yun’s body could come to a rest, Xiao’s figure appeared in front of him again as his knee slammed into his face.

Liu Yun finally reacted. The instant the knee hit his nose, he instant transmitted into the sky. The rocks underground exploded from Xiao’s knee jab like a meteorite hitting a planet.

However, before Liu Yun could heave a sigh of relief, Xiao’s figure appeared behind him like a ghost.

Liu Yun waved the Taiji Symbol in one hand and grabbed at Xiao with the other.

However, just as he attacked, Xiao tumed around and appeared in front of him. He threw a punch at Liu Yun’s face and the helmet fragmented. Liu Yum’s face distorted as he flew diagonally.

“Poor Eldest Senior Brother!” The people watching the battle couldn’t see the battle clearly. However, after the program team released an ultra slow-motion analysis, this thought surfaced in everyone’s minds.

Xiao was like an omnipotent and omnipresent god as he brutally beat up Liu Yun.

Thankfully, Liu Yun had stolen Xiao’s Holy Artifact, so his strength only remained at the Hell level. The armor on Liu Yun’s body was very powerful, preventing him from being beaten to death.

“That fellow!” An Tianzuo couldn’t help but shake his head with a bitter smile when he saw Xiao beat up Liu Yun.

“That Xiao is powerful!” Xia Liuchuan’s expression was solemn. He had always felt that the so-called Saints were strong only because they had obtained the resources of the dimension and were augmented by the Holy Artifacts.

Xia Liuchuan didn’t believe that he would lose to any Saint that was at his level. However, Jiuyang and Old K’s performance was already shocking. Xiao was even crazier.

Even if they were at the same level, Xia Liuchuan wasn’t confident of defeating Xiao.

“Thankfully, he didn’t think much of Liu Yun in the beginning. Otherwise, Liu Yun would already be dead. He wouldn’t have had the chance to steal his Holy Artifact.” Zhang Chungiu wore a heavy expression.

“Should we attack?” Xia Liuchuan asked.

“It’s too late. We can only hope that Zhou Wen can quickly destroy the teleportation nexus. Otherwise, even if we help, we won’t be able to resolve the actual problem.” Zhang Chungiu had been paying attention to the teleportation nexus.

Under the repeated bombardment of the void lightning, the teleportation nexus that resembled a black stone pillar was filled with tiny cracks. It looked like it would shatter at any moment.

Quickly shatter! Zhou Wen descended with the Void Salamander again as he watched the void lightning strike the teleportation nexus. The pillar’s comerstone, which was clearly covered in cracks, didn’t truly collapse. Only its surface crumbled away slightly.

He didn’t care about himself, but Liu Yun couldn’t hold on any longer. He was about to be beaten to a pulp.

It was only thanks to the Taiji Symbol that he could barely deal with Xiao. Every time, he would sweep the Taiji Symbol at Xiao, preventing him from killing him.

Even so, Liu Yun couldn’t last much longer. If this continued, he would probably die there.

You’re still too naive. Do you really think that the Holy Land’s teleportation nexus can be destroyed so easily? Although the void lightning can injure the teleportation nexus, it’s not that easy to truly destroy it. It will require at least another dozen or so full-strength strikes from the Void Salamander

before it can collapse the foundation. Holy God sneered indifferently.

However, Zhou Wen no longer has the time. In another three more Void Salamander lightning strikes, Xiao should be able to finish off that human. As long as the Taiji Symbol in the human’s hand loses its effect, everyone there will die. Holy God glanced at Xiao, who was thrashing Liu Yun. He was

somewhat surprised. I never expected Xiao’s strength to reach such a stage. His strength and realm have far exceeded his level. Among the three Holy Sons, he has the best combat abilities. Even Jiuyang, who has reached the Heaven level, is probably no match for him. He’s just a little too proud, but he

does have the right to be proud.

Holy God actually felt somewhat smug looking at Xiao.

After all, Xiao’s present achievements were all thanks to him alone. If he hadn’t taken Xiao to Lake Frustration and allowed Xiao to advance with the power of Lake Frustration, provided Xiao with a large number of dimensional resources, and recommended him to be in charge of the Trajectory Holy

Temple’s Holy Artifact, Xiao wouldn’t have grown strong so quickly. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The greater Xiao’s achievements were, the more glory it meant for Holy God.

Of course, Xiao didn’t obtain all of this for no reason. Holy God had brought him into Lake Frustration and made him use the power of Lake Frustration to advance only to get Xiao to capture the former principal.

Xiao received the subsequent special treatment of the resources and Holy Artifact because he had brought back the former principal.

However, Xiao’s growth far exceeded Holy God’s expectations.

“Shatter!” Zhou Wen descended with the Void Salamander again and couldn’t help but roar.

This was because Liu Yun couldn’t hold on any longer. He was about to be killed. If he couldn’t crack the teleportation nexus, Zhou Wen would have to give up on the idea of destroying the teleportation nexus and help Liu Yun.

Once Liu Yun died, the Taiji Symbol would lose its effect. Immortal and Ya would be trapped here, and the Void Salamander wouldn’t be able to leave. In the end, he still wouldn’t be able to destroy the teleportation nexus. It made things even worse.

Sometimes, one had to make a choice, so this was Zhou Wen’s last attempt. He strongly hoped that he could crack the teleportation nexus’s cornerstone.

Due to his mood, Zhou Wen’s roar was so loud that it was captured for the livestream. Everyone watching the livestream heard the roar.

They seemed to be infected by Zhou Wen’s emotions as many people subconsciously clenched their fists. They prayed inwardly, hoping that the lightning could shatter the teleportation nexus as Egg Sovereign wished.

“shatter!” Many people held their breaths, eager to punch the cornerstone themselves.

Humans like to place their hopes on unrealistic matters. They think that they can resolve all problems with emotions. What a joke. Holy God knew very well that the void lightning couldn’t destroy the teleportation nexus’s foundation.

Boom!

At the instant the void lightning descended, a volcanic eruption-like aurora streaked across the sky and struck the foundation of the teleportation nexus alongside the void lightning.
