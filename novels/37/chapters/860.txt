Chapter 861: Mountain God Temple

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen directly ordered Tyrant Behemoth to help the transport team take their trucks and goods to the other side of the broken road.

The trucks were like toys in front of Tyrant Behemoth. It could pick them up with one hand.

Soon, all the trucks, goods, and people had been moved to the other side of the broken road.

“May I know your name?” the officer asked Zhou Wen.

“Zhou Wen,” Zhou Wen answered before saying to the officer, “Leave quickly. This isn’t just the only dimensional creature. There are even more terrifying existences. There might be danger if you continue delaying.”

The officer bowed at Zhou Wen and didn’t dawdle. He immediately instructed all the soldiers to board the vehicle and leave with the goods.

“Commander Jin, I never expected Tyrant Behemoth to be a Companion Beast of our East District. Furthermore, it’s owned by such a young student. That Zhou Wen is really impressive. Not only are his Companion Beasts powerful, but he’s also powerful. He killed such a terrifying dimensional creature with a single strike. If humanity’s students are as powerful as him, would we need to be afraid of dimensional creatures in the future?” the soldier beside him said excitedly to the officer.

Jin Shihao shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “I’m afraid there might not even be one such person in a billion people. It’s just impossible for them to protect all of humanity. We soldiers are also very important. Therefore, we have to work hard to become stronger. Even if we can’t reach their level, we can still protect our compatriots who are weaker than us.”

“Although that’s the case, I’m afraid we won’t be able to possess such strength for the rest of our lives.” The soldier sighed.

Jin Shihao cursed, “If everyone thinks like you, humanity is probably doomed. If we can’t do it now, it doesn’t mean that we won’t be able to do it in the future. Did the humans of ancient times imagine that everyone would have a phone one day? Back in times of peace, would people have thought that everyone would be holding a gun to do battle? People like Zhou Wen are the pioneers of the times. One day, pioneers like them will bring powerful Companion Beasts, Essence Energy Arts, and Essence Energy Skills to everyone. When that happens, humanity will truly be able to change the world. We have to work hard to become stronger. If that day really comes and we don’t even have the ability to helm those powers, we will really be doomed.”

“Commander, I understand what you mean. By standing on the shoulders of giants we can see further. However, seeing it with our own eyes is still too shocking. He’s clearly so young, but he actually has such strength. Is the difference in talent between humans that huge?” the soldier said wistfully.

Zhou Wen constantly scanned the forest below. The collapse of the mountain path was definitely not something the dead dimensional creature could do. There had to be stronger dimensional creatures nearby.

However, he scanned the forest repeatedly and didn’t discover anything else.

With a thought, Zhou Wen put on the Invisibility Cloak and wrapped Ya’er in it before heading in the direction the centipede monster had come from.

The dense forest was dark and eerie under the moonlight. Zhou Wen didn’t enter the forest, afraid that something would happen, so he flew above it.

With the Invisibility Cloak on him and the Earth Elemental Beast ready to fight at any moment, Zhou Wen’s escaping ability was at its peak. With Truth Listener’s ability, he could escape even if he couldn’t defeat the adversary. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He didn’t discover anything along the way. Thankfully, the smell from the centipede monster was still present. Zhou Wen followed the smell and turned towards a mountain before discovering something.

There was a hill over there, standing at less than two to three hundred meter, but it was rather steep. On the mountain’s peak, there was a building that resembled a temple.

There’s actually an Earth Temple in such a place? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He observed the hill and didn’t find any stone steps leading up.

Strange, there aren’t any stone steps. How did the ancients build it? Zhou Wen carefully sized up the temple and realized that there was incense burning inside.

There was a wooden plaque hanging above the temple’s entrance. On the wooden plaque were the words “Mountain God Temple.”

So it’s not an Earth Temple, but a Mountain God Temple.

Zhou Wen frowned slightly.

If it was an Earth Temple, there was no need to worry too much. This was because the nature of Earth Temples in the East District were similar. Typically, there wouldn’t be too much danger. They even provided benefits at times.

However, Mountain God Temples were different. Mountain God Temples were divided into temples that consecrated orthodox and evil gods. Orthodox Mountain God Temples were similar to Earth Temples, so they weren’t very dangerous.

However, it was difficult to say for the Mountain God Temples that consecrated evil gods.

Some so-called mountain gods were actually demons that had developed sentience in the mountains. There were good and bad demons, and their personalities were completely different. It was because of their magical abilities that humans treated them as mountain gods to worship.

However, these mountain gods might not protect humans. There were even many mountain gods who wantonly killed humans. They made humans so afraid of them that they were worshiped.

Although the Mountain God Temple on the mountain wasn’t big, it was rather exquisitely built. It was made of pure wood, and there was incense burning inside. As the words “Mountain God Temple” were written, Zhou Wen didn’t know what the Mountain God inside looked like.

That centipede monster should have come from the Mountain God Temple. From the looks of it, the Mountain God here is most likely an evil god. The collapsed mountain path probably has something to do with this Mountain God, Zhou Wen thought to himself.

Zhou Wen focused Truth Listener’s power on the Mountain God Temple, wanting to know what was inside.

As a mysterious force enveloped the Mountain God Temple, he previously couldn’t clearly hear the situation inside. Now that Truth Listener was doing its best, the scene inside the Mountain God Temple gradually surfaced in Zhou Wen’s mind.

The temple hall was simple. On an offering table, there was something consecrated. There was an incense burner in front of it. There was incense in the burner, and there were candles on both sides. He did not know who had lit the incense.

When Zhou Wen saw what was in the temple, his expression turned odd.

It’s indeed an evil god’s Mountain God Temple. I’ve seen offerings for Snake Immortals, Fox Immortals, and Yellow Immortals. This is the first time I’ve seen someone giving offerings to a toad. Zhou Wen looked at the Mountain God Temple and couldn’t help but be curious.

What was consecrated in the Mountain God Temple looked like a toad. The fat statue was sprawled on the table with its eyes closed, as though it was enjoying itself.

Its entire body seemed to be made of copper. There were many spots on its body, making it look ugly. If it were Zhou Wen, he definitely wouldn’t consecrate such a mountain god.

However, after taking a closer look, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.

It looked like a toad lying there, but upon closer inspection, he discovered that this fellow was somewhat different from a toad.

Just as Zhou Wen was carefully observing it, he saw it open its eyes and look at him.
