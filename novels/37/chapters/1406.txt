Chapter 1407: With Heavenly Robe in Hand... Ouch...

Woods was overjoyed. Although he had paid more in the end, as long as he could obtain the Heavenly Robe, everything was worth it.

“Mr. Woods, something seems amiss. Why did Zhou Wen and company leave so quickly without getting us to join them in Luoyang?” Wood said suspiciously.

However, Woods seemed to be overly excited. “The Heavenly Robe is real. There won’t be any problems. Besides, if we were to go to Luoyang, would they dare to really allow us to join them? When the time comes, not only will they not get help, but they will also have to get someone to watch us. Cut the chatter. Quick, let’s test the Heavenly Robe’s abilities.”

Woods stroked the Heavenly Robe on his body with an eager expression.

Wood summoned a bow and aimed it at Woods, but he didn’t dare to aim at his vital spots. All he did was shoot at his arm.

With a whoosh, the arrow tore through the air and arrived in front of Woods. Woods didn’t dodge. When the arrow arrived in front of him, the Heavenly Robe moved autonomously, pulling his body to dodge the arrow.

“Haha, as expected of the Heavenly Robe. With this robe in hand, it will be easy for our Cape family to enter the rankings. In the future, even if a Calamity-grade expert wants to make things difficult for our Cape family, with this robe around, we might still have the strength to put up a fight. Come, come, shoot a few more arrows at me. Let me experience the magical power of the Heavenly Robe,” said Woods excitedly.

When Wood saw that the Heavenly Robe was indeed magical, he was overjoyed. He immediately drew his bow and strafed a few arrows without any worries.

As he had confirmed that the Heavenly Robe was indeed useful, Wood didn’t target any special spots. He just randomly shot them at Woods.

Woods stood there without any intention of dodging. He believed that since the Heavenly Robe had allowed him to dodge the first arrow, and the subsequent arrows had the same strength as the first arrow, it would be impossible for him not to dodge them.

However, how could he know that the Heavenly Robe had a dodge chance? He was lucky to trigger the Heavenly Robe’s Lucky Dodge for the first arrow, but without the augmentation of lucky equipment, the Heavenly Robe’s dodge chance wasn’t high.

Everyone was in a festive mood as they waited for the Heavenly Robe to showcase its magical powers. However, they suddenly heard Woods scream.

Out of the eight arrows that Wood shot out, five of them hit Woods, of which four hit the Heavenly Robe. Being Terror-grade equipment, the Heavenly Robe’s defense was pretty good, allowing it to block four arrows. However, one arrow hit Woods’s face; there was nothing obstructing it. It shot right into his nose, causing him to fall to the ground and roll around in pain.

“How can this be!” Wood and company were dumbfounded. After they reacted, they hurriedly ran to Woods and pulled out the arrow to treat his injuries.

“Woods, is this Heavenly Robe fake? Did you check it properly?” Wood’s expression changed as he looked at the bloody hole in Woods’s nose.

“It’s not fake. The information transmitted by the Heavenly Robe isn’t wrong. It’s a Terror-grade Heavenly Robe. It does have the ability to dodge. As you saw just now, the first arrow was dodged by the Heavenly Robe… But how did the subsequent arrows…” Woods was alarmed and unsure. He repeatedly confirmed the information transmitted by the Heavenly Robe. All the skills and abilities were identical to the one Zhou Wen had written in the contract. Their levels weren’t bad either.

“Try sensing the detailed information of those skills again. See if there’s any problem based on whatever you can sense,” Wood said.

Woods hurriedly sensed the information. After a while, his expression turned ugly as his body began to tremble.

“This dodging skill has a certain chance. Not all attacks can be dodged. We’ve been scammed.” Woods was trembling in anger.

“How did this happen? How did Zhou Wen use it to dodge all the Calamity-grade attacks?” Wood asked in a daze. He now understood that they had been fooled. There were probably no break-out creatures in Luoyang. Zhou Wen and company were deliberately scamming them.

“How would I know!” Woods was beyond tears. He suddenly struggled to get up and took out his phone to call An Sheng. As he called, he said hatefully, “No, this matter isn’t over between us and the An family. We have to make them give us an explanation.”

After the phone rang a few times, An Sheng’s voice sounded. “Mr. Woods, do you have any business to offer us?”

“An Sheng, that Heavenly Robe can’t dodge attacks 100%. You guys were pulling off a scam,” said Woods angrily.

Although he knew that being angry was useless, he couldn’t hold it in.

They originally thought that they had exchanged an unmineable mine for a huge bargain, but they never expected that the thing they had exchanged for was equally useless. They had even lost nearly two hundred tonnes of Essence Crystals.

He originally only needed to pay an additional hundred tonnes, but with the bribe he had given An Sheng and Zhou Wen’s subsequent scam, it was almost worth an additional hundred tonnes.

An Sheng said calmly, “Mr. Woods, please don’t say that. Our An family has always been trustworthy. It’s impossible for us to sell you fake goods. Is the level and ability of the Heavenly Robe identical to what’s written in the contract? If there’s no discrepancy, how can it be a fake Companion Beast?”

“But this Heavenly Robe only has a chance of dodging. Even a Mythical attack can’t be completely dodged, much less a Calamity-grade attack,” said Woods in exasperation.

“Oh, you’re talking about that? Of course. The dodging ability of the Heavenly Robe requires the augmentation of the Luck stat. The higher the Luck stat, the higher the success rate of dodging. If you need it, we also have Luck Companion Beasts for sale,” An Sheng said. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Woods, Wood, and company were taken aback when they heard that. Woods said in disbelief, “It still needs the augmentation of the Luck stat? Didn’t Zhou Wen only use Heavenly Robe previously? How did he dodge all of them?”

“Mr. Woods, you can’t make such a comparison. My young master is a lucky person blessed by the heavens. He received the favor and care of the heavens and was born with abundant luck. No matter how low the chances are, it’s a hundred percent chance when it comes to my young master. However, it’s different for ordinary people. They still need some lucky equipment to achieve the ideal effect of the Heavenly Robe.” An Sheng’s words were clearly saying: “How can you unlucky fools compare to my young master? Don’t you know what kind of trash you are?”

“Adjutant An, are you sure that lucky equipment can increase the dodge chance? What kind of lucky equipment can achieve a 100% dodge chance?” Woods suppressed the urge to curse An Sheng and asked softly.

“Of course I’m sure. If you don’t believe me, you can experiment with lucky equipment. As for how many Luck stat augmentations are needed, I know that too well. Previously, my young master had bought quite a lot of lucky equipment. It was thanks to that equipment that he was able to reach a 100% dodge chance. Now that the Heavenly Robe has been sold to you, those lucky Companion Beasts are useless. If you want them, I can persuade my young master to transfer them to you. I’ll definitely give you a discount on the price. After all, you are old customers,” An Sheng said.

“I’ll give it a try first. We’ll talk about the Luck Companion Beast later.” Woods hung up and braced himself to contact the head of the Cape family to tell him the entire story.

“Come back and try using the Luck Companion Beasts first before we discuss the necessary countermeasures.” The Cape’s family head knew that it was pointless saying anything now. All he could do was let them return first. If they could achieve a 100% dodge chance with the augmentation of the Luck stat, it wasn’t unacceptable.
