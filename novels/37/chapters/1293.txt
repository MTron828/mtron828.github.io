Chapter 1294: Chick Returns

Zhou Wen teleported to Earth before returning to the garden through the swapping of a brick in the garden with Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping.

He didn’t directly do the swap because he was afraid that others would notice something from the brick.

After returning, Zhou Wen continued researching Absolute Space.

After watching Zhong Ziya and company clear the level, Zhou Wen felt that it was pointless to barely clear the Venusian dimensional zone. It was useless to obtain one or two stars. He had to obtain first place, which was above five stars, to obtain the true Venusian Companion Beast.

Tsukuyomi, The Fallen, and the Holy Spirit Association used three different methods to arrive in front of the Golden Palace. From the looks of it, Tsukuyomi was the fastest, and The Fallen was also faster than the Holy Spirit Association. Based on this, the less time it takes to reach the Golden Palace, the higher the chance of obtaining a starred rating. However, the time difference between The Fallen and the Holy Spirit Association wasn’t that great. The Fallen received four stars, while the Holy Spirit Association only received one star. This means that other than taking less time, there should be other criteria…?Zhou Wen analyzed the various possibilities to make it easier for him to clear the level in the future.

The various factions were also analyzing this problem, but they had one more thing to analyze than Zhou Wen—the battle between Deceit King and Immortal.

As Ya was already severely injured to begin with, everyone knew that the battle didn’t showcase Ya’s true strength. It was useless to analyze it, so they were just analyzing the battle between Zhou Wen and Immortal.

“No matter how many times I watch it, I still feel that these two people are too strong. Just a mistake that isn’t considered a mistake ended the battle.” Xia Xuanyue repeatedly watched the battle replay and couldn’t help but praise.

“People who are good at spatial abilities are thorny characters,” Xia Liuchuan said.

“It’s not just a matter of spatial abilities. Such a fellow will be very terrifying no matter which faction he belongs to,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“That’s true, but Deceit King is really shameless. He took advantage of both sides and obtained benefits from both sides. He wanted people from both sides dead. He’s really ruthless,” Xia Liuchuan said.

“Brother, who do you think this Deceit King is?” Xia Xuanyue said after some thought. She had a vague feeling that she found Deceit King familiar.

However, it was only an inkling. Xia Xuanyue didn’t know why she had such a feeling.

“Who knows? There are too many powerful people in this world. We have to be careful. If we aren’t careful, our Xia family might fall and never be able to make a comeback.” Xia Liuchuan sighed.

Although the six families had their heritage and were still top-notch forces on Earth, they no longer had the absolute advantage like before.

“Do you think it’s possible that Human Sovereign and Deceit King are the same person?” Xia Xuanyue said after some thought. She wasn’t sure, but she felt they were vaguely similar.

“I don’t think so. If Deceit King has the domineering strength of the Human Sovereign, he could have directly destroyed Immortal. Why would he go through so much trouble?” Xia Liuchuan felt that the possibility wasn’t high.

The various factions had similar guesses, but after some analysis, they felt that the possibility of Deceit King and Human Sovereign being the same person wasn’t high.

Zhou Wen was at home fiddling with the Flaming Monarch Companion Egg and the Void Bird skill crystal.

Flaming Monarch: Terror

Life Providence: Sovereign of Fire

Life Soul: Power of Fire

Wheel of Destiny: Flaming Nation

Terror transformation: Eternal Flame

Strength: 86

Speed: 93

Constitution: 91

Essence Energy: 99

Talent Skill: Fire Cage, River of Flames, Burning Body, Road of Ashes

Companion Form: Flaming Monarch King Sword

This was a very pure fire-elemental Companion Beast. Its offensive strength was off the charts and it was highly lethal, but its flaws were relatively obvious. If a pure fire-elemental Companion Beast were to encounter one that countered it, it would be very easy to restrain it.

However, in some special environments, Companion Beasts like Flaming Monarch were invincible.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to hatch the Flaming Monarch, he suddenly heard a bird’s cry. A golden stream of light appeared out of thin air and flashed in front of him. The Flaming Monarch Companion Egg in Zhou Wen’s hand vanished.

Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly prepared for combat. However, on careful look, he realized that a golden chick had landed on a tree branch in the garden. It had the Flaming Monarch Companion Egg in its mouth.

It swung its head and threw the Flaming Monarch Companion Egg into the air. Then, it raised its head and opened its mouth, swallowing the Companion Egg that was two to three times bigger than its head.

“Chick?” Zhou Wen sized up the chick in surprise. Its aura resembled Chick’s, but he wasn’t sure.

This chick was only the size of a parrot. It was covered in pale golden fur and was much smaller than before. Furthermore, it didn’t look as ferocious as before. Now, it didn’t look like an eagle, but a parrot.

Furthermore, Chick was inside the Chaos Bead. Without Zhou Wen’s strength to open it, it was impossible for Chick to come out even if it had evolved to the Terror grade.

The chick burped after swallowing the Flaming Monarch Companion Egg. When it heard Zhou Wen’s voice, it spread its wings. Before Zhou Wen could clearly discern its actions, it had already landed on Zhou Wen’s shoulder and rubbed its tiny head intimately against his neck.

It’s really Chick!?Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.?Just come out if you want to, but why eat my Flaming Monarch Companion Egg? It wasn’t easy to obtain it.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen knew that Chick was much more useful than the Flaming Monarch, so he didn’t mind. He held Chick in his hand and carefully looked at it. He realized that feathers had grown on its head. The tail feathers behind it had also grown longer. It looked a little like a parrot.

This fellow seems to be slowly growing towards the appearance of a phoenix. Could it be that it has to advance to the Calamity grade before it can return to the appearance of a phoenix??Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Chick bounced around and flew back to Ya’er’s hand to play with her.

Having lost his Companion Egg, Zhou Wen had no choice but to take out the skill crystal of the Void Bird.

What kind of spatial skill will it be??Zhou Wen was somewhat expectant. After all, it was a spatial skill crystal. Furthermore, it was at the Terror grade. It was too rare.

He snapped a picture with his phone and saw that it was indeed a Void Bird crystal.

At the same time, he circulated the Godfiend Era and Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art in an attempt to absorb the skill crystal. He easily absorbed it into his body, opening up a new Essence Energy circulation path.

When the skill crystal was completely absorbed, Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd.

Wings of Tomorrow: Wings that fly towards tomorrow.

What’s going on? Is this a spatial skill? It looks like a temporal skill no matter how I look at it!?Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that this thing could really fly to tomorrow.
