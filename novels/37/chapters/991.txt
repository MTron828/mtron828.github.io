Chapter 992: Dimensional Wheel

Translator: CKtalon

Many people disapproved of the shadow’s words. So what if someone became first on the rankings? No matter how strong they were, it was impossible for them to control all of humanity. The various bigwigs wouldn’t admit that such a person had become the lord of Earth.

“You might think that this is ridiculous. Why is the person first on the rankings the lord of Earth? It’s very simple. This is because the first on the rankings will obtain the Dimensional Wheel that represents dimensional power. Whoever controls it will obtain invincible power. The possession of the Dimensional Wheel will last until next year’s ranking battle. Then, the next King of Earth and the owner of the Dimensional Wheel will be decided.” As the figure spoke, a light wheel appeared on the screen. As the light was too intense, it was like a sun. Ordinary people couldn’t see what it was.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and could only tell that it resembled a sphere. He didn’t know what it was for.

Have the rules been changed? Zhou Wen was puzzled before sending The Thearch a message. “The Thearch, I remember you once said that the various races agreed to hold a Guardian battle once every hundred years to determine the ownership of Earth. Why has it become a year?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Thearch quickly replied: “I’m in Chess Mountain. How would I know what happened in the dimension? However, I can guess that it might be related to your teacher, Wang Mingyuan.”

“Why?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand how The Thearch had come to such a conclusion.

“Because the fellows in the dimension also have fear,” The Thearch said.

“Fear? Are you saying that they are afraid of Teacher?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.

Although Wang Mingyuan had become the king of the Dragon Gods, according to what Zhou Wen knew, there were eight such monarchs among the Octokind. Furthermore, above the Octokind were terrifying Apocalypse-grade powerhouses. It didn’t seem right to say that they were afraid of Wang Mingyuan.

“Wang Mingyuan only absorbed and fused with a Guardian. In such a short period of time, he actually broke through to the Calamity grade. Such an evolutionary speed is extremely terrifying in the dimension. You have to understand that the time in the dimension isn’t calculated in the same way as here. Any lifeform’s lifespan far exceeds humans by a hundred or a thousand times, but their evolution speed will also be much slower. Wang Mingyuan’s evolution speed has frightened some dimensional species, so they want to speed up their exploration of Earth,” The Thearch said.

“If they are really that afraid, why don’t they just kill Teacher?” Zhou Wen felt that The Thearch’s analysis wasn’t convincing.

“It’s not like there’s only one race in the dimension. Their relationship is very complicated. Although I haven’t seen him with my own eyes, I can imagine that your teacher is a very intelligent person. He understands the balance of survival in the dimension. Although it might be very dangerous, he hasn’t died yet,” The Thearch said.

“That’s just your guess,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“It doesn’t matter if it’s right or wrong. What’s interesting is that some people have changed the rules, proving their impatience.” The Thearch didn’t argue with Zhou Wen.

“What exactly is that Dimensional Wheel ? Can one really be invincible with it?” Zhou Wen now valued this problem.

“I don’t know. I’ve been trapped in Chess Mountain for too long. In our era, there wasn’t such a thing. However, since it’s something that those fellows created, it likely has powerful strength. I don’t know if one will become invincible with it, but the power of that thing is definitely not weaker than the Terror grade,” The Thearch pondered.

All the cubes in the world dimmed. The creature and Dimensional Wheel that had spoken previously vanished.

Zhou Wen’s expression was somewhat solemn. The appearance of the Dimensional Wheel had caused the situation on Earth to slide in an unpredictable direction.

If it was really as they said, possessing the Dimensional Wheel meant invincibility, what would happen if the person who obtained the Dimensional Wheel was someone like Jing Daoxian and Night Thearch?

Just imagine what would happen to Earth if an invincible power appeared on Earth and was controlled by a crazy person?

Zhou Wen couldn’t imagine it, nor did he dare think about it.

At the same time, what made Zhou Wen feel depressed was the lofty attitude of the dimensional creatures. They seemed to treat Earth as a game arena. Whoever won the game would be rewarded by them.

What was the difference between this and dogs in a dog-fighting ring who were rewarded by their owners with dog food?

How can I break the influence of the dimension on humans? Zhou Wen constantly pondered over this question.

Snatching the so-called Dimensional Wheel that could bestow invincible power wasn’t the real solution.

Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in being the king of the doggy arena. What he wanted was to destroy the supercilious dimensional creatures.

It doesn’t seem possible to defeat them at present. The physiques of humans are too weak. Without the help of Guardians, it’s difficult for us to advance to the Mythical stage. And a Mythical stage is no different from cannon fodder in dimensional zones. Zhou Wen knew very well the difference.

However, no matter how great the difference was, he still wanted to continue because there was no way out unless he wanted to muddle his way through life.

Can I think of a way to sever the connection between the dimension and Earth? This thought surfaced in Zhou Wen’s mind, but he quickly rejected it.

Perhaps there really was such a method that could sever the connection between the two, but after severing it, humanity had no chance of advancing further. They would only be trapped in this world, making no progress.

Once the passageway between the two was opened again, humanity would face an even more difficult situation.

Instead of waiting to be ravaged, he might as well resolve the problem now and make humanity stronger. He wanted humanity to be strong enough to fight dimensional creatures. Only then could they truly escape the fate of being enslaved.

The ice maiden once said that Earth might be the birthplace of the dimension. Many things here can be said to be extremely precious in the dimension. Perhaps this is the true opportunity for humanity, Zhou Wen thought to himself.

“Are you interested in becoming the King of Earth? I can help you contract the strongest Guardian.” The Thearch wanted to tempt Zhou Wen again.

“How powerful is it? Is it at the Terror grade?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Of course.” The Thearch gave an affirmative answer.

“A Guardian that survived from ancient times?” Zhou Wen immediately guessed something. This was because he had never seen a newly born Guardian with the Terror transformation ability.

“Yes, an invincible Guardian of that era.” The Thearch sent a message.
