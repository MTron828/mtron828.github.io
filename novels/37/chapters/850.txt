When Zhou Wen saw this scene, he knew that Charlie was doomed.

His book and the crucifix’s abilities were indeed powerful, but he didn’t know that the mask wasn’t the crux of the problem. Destroying the mask alone was useless. Instead, it might put him in danger.

Indeed, after a commotion in the Fiend Tomb, grayish-white dust spewed out.

When Charlie saw the dust, his expression changed slightly. The book and crucifix in his hand glowed again. He wanted to repel the dust, but the dust was like smoke. Repelling the smoke on one side would have the smoke on the other side sweep over and spray on Charlie’s face.

Everything happened so quickly that even the Cape family couldn’t stop it. By the time they reacted, the dust had already condensed into a mask on Charlie’s face.

When the Cape family rushed forward to help Charlie, the crucifix in Charlie’s hand had a shocking glow. It stabbed the two Cape family members who wanted to help him.

The two of them were caught off guard. After being injured by Charlie, they fell to the ground and their bodies quickly turned into Fiend Stones. Everyone was shocked.

However, Charlie, who was controlled by the Ghoul Mask, didn’t care. He waved the book and crucifix in his hand and charged at the humans on the stone platform.

Zhang Chunqiu suddenly attacked. His sword slashed like a stream of light, instantly shattering the mask on Charlie’s face. However, it didn’t injure Charlie’s face. The precision of his sword technique was shocking.

However, it was useless. The shattered mask quickly reformed and covered Charlie’s face again.

Everyone fought Charlie, but it wasn’t good enough to injure him. Even attacking the mask on his face was useless. Instantly, everyone was in disarray.

In the end, Zhang Siyou produced a talisman and stuck it to the Ghoul Mask, causing Charlie to stand there motionless. However, the mask could not be removed from his face.

The Cape family thought of many ways, but they were unable to remove the mask. They could only seek help from Zhang Siyou.

Zhang Siyou said, “My Mythical Ghost Suppression Talisman can only suppress it, but it can’t completely be eliminated. Furthermore, this mask is very strange. It’s useless to shatter it. I’m helpless as well. We must think of other solutions.”

This outcome was naturally within Zhou Wen’s expectations. The Ghoul Mask wasn’t the main point. No matter how strong one was, it was impossible to kill it. They had to dig up the grave and destroy the human-face symbol below.

The Zhang family looked at Moses, hoping that he could remove the mask. However, Moses shook his head and said, “If I had attacked from the beginning and completely destroyed the mask, I might have had a chance. Now, the mask is already on Charlie’s face. My Guardian is too powerful. Even if I can destroy the mask with one strike, Charlie won’t be spared.”

The Zhang family and the Cape family were in a dilemma. No one could solve the problem of the Fiend Tomb without harming Charlie.

When Zhang Chunqiu saw Zhou Wen standing by the side and watching all of this happen, his expression remained abnormally calm. With a thought, he asked Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, do you have a way to remove the mask without harming Charlie?”

As everyone fell silent, they looked at the two of them when they heard Zhang Chunqiu’s question.

Zhou Wen answered, “Sure, but I’ll say it again. I’m not as capable as Charlie and company. If you want me to resolve the problem, you have to dig open the Fiend Tomb.”

“Why are you still spouting nonsense at a time like this? The mask has already been lured out. Why are you still digging up the Fiend Tomb?” Uncle Zhang said.

As a conservative of the Zhang family, the last thing he wanted was to dig up the Fiend Tomb.

Zhou Wen was helpless as well. This was the result of unequal information. It was common sense from his point of view, but to the Zhang family, it was a mysterious and unfathomable unknown force. They were too afraid of the Fiend Tomb and were afraid that the Zhang family would be wiped out if the Fiend Tomb was dug up. Therefore, they were extremely against it.

“Uncle, Zhou Wen isn’t someone who speaks without reason. He must have his reasons for saying that.” Zhang Chunqiu and Dugu Ge had seen Zhou Wen’s strength from outside Forbidden City and knew that he was extraordinary.

Furthermore, back then, everyone believed that Zhou Wen and Old Master Xia had been trapped in Forbidden City. No one had seen him come out, but to their surprise, he had returned to Luoyang unscathed while Old Master Xia had vanished without a trace. Zhang Chunqiu knew that he himself couldn’t do such a thing.

“The truth is right in front of us. What reason do we need?” Uncle Zhang said coldly.

“Celestial Master, the Fiend Tomb’s influence on our Zhang family is getting more and more serious. If we can’t resolve it completely, I’m afraid our Zhang family will die in a few years, even if there are no disasters or calamities. Now that things have come to this, rather than being sitting ducks, why don’t we let Zhou Wen give it a try? I believe he can resolve the problem without alarming Ba. Celestial Master, please give him a chance and also give our Zhang family descendants a chance,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he bowed in front of Zhang Siyou.

“Chunqiu, what are you doing? Getting rid of that mask doesn’t require digging up the Fiend Tomb. We are only helpless because we are worried about Charlie’s life...” Uncle Zhang was immediately enraged.

“Now that things have come to this, I don’t think I can hold back anymore. Celestial Master, if you are willing to let my Guardian take action, I guarantee that I can destroy the mask. However, I can’t guarantee Charlie’s life,” Moses said.

“Moses... How dare you...” The Cape family members glared at him.

“Enough.” After Zhang Siyou spoke, everyone quietened down and looked at him. It was still Zhang Siyou who called the shots here.

“Zhou Wen, how confident are you?” Zhang Siyou looked at Zhang Chunqiu who was kneeling in front of him before asking Zhou Wen.

“I was only 70% confident previously, but now that I’ve seen the mask’s ability, I’m 90% confident,” Zhou Wen said.

“Do you need anything?” Zhang Siyou asked again.

“No, one person is enough,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Alright, then do it. If you succeed, the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg will be yours,” Zhang Siyou said with a nod.

“Celestial Master, we can’t dig up the Fiend Tomb...” Uncle Zhang said anxiously.

“Brother, I’ve already made my decision. There’s no need to speak further,” Zhang Siyou said calmly.

Uncle Zhang stomped his feet in anger. “Have you forgotten the teachings of the ancestral Celestial Master? Digging open the Fiend Tomb is a calamity for our Zhang family!”

“Zhou Wen, what are you waiting for?” Zhang Chunqiu pretended not to hear his uncle’s indignant words as he stood up and nudged Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen no longer had any qualms as he summoned Tyrant Behemoth. With a boom, Tyrant Behemoth’s majestic body landed in front of the Fiend Tomb.

“Tyrant Behemoth... That’s actually Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast...” Apart from the Zhang family, the other families were alarmed.

After all, it was a powerful existence ranked fourth on the previous rankings. In fact, although Tyrant Behemoth was ranked fourth, it had never lost.
