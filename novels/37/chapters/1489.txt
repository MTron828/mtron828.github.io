Chapter 1490 Golden Qilin

Zhou Wen clearly remembered that he had already made an attempt back when he was brought up here by the giant bear. He couldn’t lift the calabash at all, much less the millstone below.

He originally wanted to see if he could pick up the calabash that had been fed numerous pills, but to his surprise, he easily picked up the millstone along with it.

Could it be because I ate that Golden Elixir Pill? After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that there was only one possibility. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the millstone and calabash to become lighter for no reason.

The Golden Elixir Pill turned Zhou Wen to stone. After a baffling recovery, he seemed to be able to lift the millstone and calabash.

Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to think too much because the terrifying explosions outside were approaching the main entrance.

Thankfully, Liu Yun had closed the door when he left. Otherwise, the two terrifying dimensional creatures would have already rushed in.

Zhou Wen kept paying attention to the situation outside. At the instant the two Terror creatures charged forward, Jing Daoxian pulled Liu Yun and charged down the stairs. The timing was perfect.

The two terrifying creatures rushed to the door as the two of them rushed down.

The giant bear roared and turned to chase after them. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When Zhou Wen saw this scene, he knew that his previous worries were correct.

The giant bear’s intelligence wasn’t ordinary. Zhou Wen had previously turned into a stone statue thanks to his deceit. He didn’t believe that it would watch them escape.

Just as Zhou Wen expected, the giant bear chased after them.

Unfortunately, the Golden Qilin-like dimensional creature didn’t chase after them. It sized up the door of Laojun Platform and paced beside it a few times.

Zhou Wen thought to himself, This door is the door to Laojun Platform after all. That giant bear is an extremely terrifying existence. It’s fine if it can smash through the door, but it’s impossible for a random dimensional creature to smash through the door, right?

Boom!

Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the Golden Qilin pounced forward and slammed the door with its sharp claws, causing it to rumble with a terrifying sound.

Golden light bloomed from the Golden Qilin’s body. Its golden body was as crystalline as glass. It seemed to be augmented by some divine power as it struck the door again and again.

Zhou Wen was somewhat flustered in the beginning, but after a few strikes, he realized that although the Golden Qilin’s power was an onslaught and Zhou Wen was far from its match, it couldn’t crack the door like the giant bear.

The Golden Qilin struck crazily for a while, but it failed to damage the door at all. In the end, it had no choice but to stop.

Indeed, it’s impossible for an existence like the giant bear to randomly appear. Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief.

He guessed that the Golden Qilin was very likely a Hell-level existence. Zhou Wen was indeed much weaker than it. If it rushed in, Zhou Wen would probably have a hard time fighting it. All he could do was think of a way to escape. Now that the Golden Qilin couldn’t enter, Zhou Wen had more choices. It was best if he waited for it to leave before thinking of a way to leave Laojun Platform.

Zhou Wen was somewhat worried if he could successfully walk down the 33 steps.

Previously, the giant bear had brought him up here. It probably wouldn’t be easy to go down

now.

Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he suddenly realized that the Golden Qilin was acting abnormally again. It walked to the door and didn’t strike it this time. Instead, it raised its front claw and tapped the door with a golden claw.

Oh no! Zhou Wen’s expression changed drastically when he heard the Golden Qilin knock on the door.

The rhythm was identical to Jing Daoxian’s knocking. It was clearly the way to open the door to Laojun Platform

.

Holy sh*t, this fellow actually knows how to use such a method to open the door. How high is its intelligence? Zhou Wen was alarmed as the door slowly opened.

The extremely ferocious face, that resembled a tiger and lion but was neither one, immediately appeared in Zhou Wen’s eyes. He had heard it previously, but now that he saw it with his own eyes, he found it somewhat different. The ferocious gaze and domineering aura made him feel like it stood at the top of a food chain.

It wasn’t because it was beautiful, but because of its unparalleled power.

Zhou Wen held the Immortal Culling Sword as he wore the Prisoned Dragon armor. At the same time, he circulated the Calamity-grade Ancient Sovereign Sutra.

Although the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s Calamity Zone couldn’t kill and could only heal living beings, the Calamity-grade Ancient Sovereign Sutra could greatly improve Zhou Wen’s various qualities, making him comparable to a true Calamity-grade creature.

Zhou Wen had no intention of retreating as he stared down the Golden Qilin with his sword.

Laojun Platform was a small place, so there was definitely no place to hide. He could only lure the Golden Qilin in first. It would be best if he could kill it.

If he couldn’t kill it, he would find an opportunity to rush down Laojun Platform.

After the Golden Qilin opened the door, it didn’t immediately attack Zhou Wen. Instead, it slowly walked through the door and stared at him.

Zhou Wen imagined that it was about to launch an attack, but to his surprise, the fellow swung its tail and closed the door.

Zhou Wen’s heart sank. This action proved that this fellow’s intelligence was extremely high. Furthermore, it was extremely sinister and vicious.

The place became an independent space the moment the door was closed. Zhou Wen couldn’t leave even with spatial instant transmission unless he opened the door first.

Although Zhou Wen had already memorized the method Jing Daoxian used to open the door, opening it required time. It wasn’t an easy task to open the door in front of such a terrifying creature.

The Golden Qilin didn’t immediately attack Zhou Wen after closing the door. Its body shook as golden light bloomed from its body. A golden glow instantly enveloped the entire

yard.

Zhou Wen gathered his strength to resist the golden light, but when the golden light touched Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation, it didn’t cause any damage. However, the golden light was distorted by the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation, forming a golden halo around Zhou Wen. It failed to illuminate him.

Zhou Wen knew that the golden light was likely the domain of the Golden Qilin, but he didn’t know what use it had. It didn’t look like an offensive domain.

Zhou Wen felt even warier towards such kinds of domains.

He could tell what kind of power an offensive domain had at a glance, but he couldn’t figure out the effects of such a domain. He might end up screwing up somehow.

The Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and Truth Listener were already in place to prevent him from being affected by some unknown force.

The Golden Qilin walked over step by step amidst the golden light. Its eyes seemed to condense into something corporeal. It was ferocious and domineering. If it were anyone with a weaker mental fortitude, they would probably lose the battle of wits.

Under such circumstances, the Golden Qilin still didn’t choose to lunge forward. Instead, it approached step by step, hoping to force Zhou Wen into a corner, preventing him from escaping

This fellow is really sinister and terrifying! This was the first time Zhou Wen had encountered such a dimensional creature. He knew that he couldn’t retreat, or the situation would only worsen.

With a thought, Zhou Wen suddenly exerted strength with the hilt of his sword and pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword.
