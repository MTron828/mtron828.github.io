Chapter 753: Invisibility Strike

Translator: CKtalon

The power of the Bright Torch Vision World enveloped the entire area.

However, at the instant the Bright Torch Vision World activated, Old Master Xia suddenly vanished. Truth Listener couldn’t sense his location within its range, making Zhou Wen feel uneasy.

When the power of the Bright Torch Vision World stopped, he saw Old Master Xia’s figure appear not far from him as though he had never moved.

“Universe Shifting, Yin and Yang Interconnect. There aren’t many abilities that can achieve this level. I only obtained the Yin Yang Universe Ring Life Soul after searching for nearly ten years. Using this Life Soul, I can temporarily reverse Yin and Yang, preventing any force from injuring or seeing me,” Old Master Xia said calmly as he stroked the ring with a Taiji symbol on his finger.

“How many people have you killed and how many Life Souls have you plundered? Don’t you think that those Life Souls are like the ghosts of those people, pestering you every day and night?” Zhou Wen unsummoned Torch Dragon to prevent it from being killed by Old Master Xia.

After the World King Transformation, Torch Dragon entered a weakened state, greatly reducing its strength. It could no longer play a decisive role in such a battle.

Old Master Xia said calmly, “In this era, if I’m still afraid of the supernatural, how can I defy the heavens and change my fate? I’m not afraid of ghosts or gods. I’m afraid I won’t be able to make all dimensional creatures prostrate before me.”

“It’s about time. As one of the nine main Life Souls of the Connate Great Emperor Sutra, help me advance to the Mythical stage.” The black jade armor on Old Master Xia’s body emitted a terrifying black light. As Old Master Xia threw a punch, space tore apart, forming a black sun.

However, upon careful inspection, the black sun was a black hole. It produced a huge suction force that pulled Zhou Wen in.

As Old Master Xia blasted the black hole at Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen felt the suction force grow stronger, as though it was about to pull his soul in.

Zhou Wen’s figure flashed as he suddenly vanished.

Old Master Xia frowned slightly as he looked around, but he didn’t find Zhou Wen. It was as though he had vanished into thin air.

Almost instantly, Old Master Xia condensed a ball of sun-like radiance in his palm. The light illuminated all of Forbidden City. Wherever it shone, hot smoke would emit. No matter where one hid, they would be forced out by this indiscriminate attack.

However, Old Master Xia didn’t sense anything amiss as though Zhou Wen had really vanished into thin air.

Does he have an ability similar to the Yin Yang Universe Ring? Old Master Xia frowned slightly.

Zhou Wen naturally didn’t have the Yin Yang Universe Ring, but he had the Invisibility Cloak. With the Invisibility Cloak’s Wheel of Destiny activated, he had three minutes of complete invisibility. Attacks were useless against him.

After Zhou Wen used the Invisibility Cloak, he unsummoned Demonic Neonate, who was hiding behind the roof of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, and charged towards the entrance of Forbidden City.

The invisible ability could only last for three minutes. After three minutes, he could only remain physically invisible. That way, he would be easily discovered. Therefore, Zhou Wen wanted to use this time to escape Forbidden City.

However, when he rushed to the entrance of Forbidden City, he realized that the door had already closed.

However, the invisibility force made him invisible and intangible during the three minutes. He could directly penetrate matter as Zhou Wen charged straight for the door.

Bam!

Zhou Wen’s body was repelled by a strange force, preventing him from rushing out.

How did this happen? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he felt that something was amiss.

The force that repelled him wasn’t the door itself, but a force that resembled lightning. His body was still feeling numb.

The black clouds and lightning that filled the sky had already made Zhou Wen feel that something was amiss. It felt even more so now. Zhou Wen looked up and carefully observed Forbidden City. He realized that the Corner Tower on the city wall was emitting a faint glow. Although the light wasn’t strong, it was especially eye-catching with the dark clouds covering the sun.

Zhou Wen flew into the air and looked at the other three Corner Towers in the city. Indeed, they were glowing.

Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to think about the reason. He didn’t have much time left. It had been nearly twenty seconds since he rushed over. Since he couldn’t leave now, Zhou Wen had to think of a way to kill Old Master Xia. Otherwise, he would be the one to die.

The Connate Dominance Body is probably similar to Li Xuan’s Immortal God of Combat. Its self-healing ability is even stronger. It’s probably very difficult to kill him by simply injuring his body. How can I kill him? Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss, but he couldn’t sit idle.

He quickly rushed towards Old Master Xia who was still standing in his spot. He used all sorts of methods to find Zhou Wen, but it wasn’t of much use. The eight Life Providences and Life Souls he already had, as well as all sorts of Essence Energy Skills, failed to be of any use. He failed to find the invisible Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen came in front of Old Master Xia and pointed at his mouth. Then, he summoned the Primordial Spore and allowed it to enter his body. Regardless of whether it was useful or not, he had to give it a try.

After the Primordial Spore entered Old Master Xia’s body, Zhou Wen pulled out the Orchid Blade and released it from invisibility. He stabbed it into Old Master Xia’s mouth. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The Orchid Blade entered his mouth and penetrated Old Master Xia’s brain, but it couldn’t penetrate his skull from the other end.

Zhou Wen didn’t care as he twisted the Orchid Blade.

Old Master Xia’s strength erupted like a volcano, sending Zhou Wen flying. He didn’t even manage to pull the Orchid Blade out from his mouth.

Zhou Wen’s body tumbled in the air as he finally managed to dissipate the terrifying force. However, he still spat out a mouthful of blood.

Zhou Wen wasn’t concerned about his injuries. Such injuries couldn’t kill him. All he wanted to know was if this strike was of any use.

Old Master Xia stood there with the Orchid Blade in his mouth. His brain had been severely damaged by Zhou Wen, but when Zhou Wen looked at him, he saw Old Master Xia extend his palm, grab the Orchid Blade, and pull it out of his mouth.

As for his injuries, they were rapidly recovering.

How can he still self-heal like this? Zhou Wen’s heart chilled. He still couldn’t kill Old Master Xia despite delivering such an attack. He couldn’t think of any power that could kill him.

Old Master Xia held the Orchid Blade, but there was no anger in his eyes. Instead, there was some fanaticism. “You really surprise me. Although I haven’t advanced to the Mythical stage, with the augmentation of a Guardian, I’m already a Mythical creature. Furthermore, I’m much stronger than ordinary Mythical creatures. Under such circumstances, you can still injure me, and not just once. It’s enough to prove that your Life Providence and Life Soul are very powerful.

“However, this also means that after absorbing your talent, Life Providence, and Life Soul, I will become stronger after advancing to the Mythical stage. I should be thanking you.” Old Master Xia walked towards Zhou Wen step by step, his killing intent burning to the extreme.
