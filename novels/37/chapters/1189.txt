Chapter 1190: Stepping onto the Bridge

Translator: CKtalon

Da! Da! Da!

The Gatling-like weapon swept crazily at the Three-Lives Stone as blue flames spewed out from its muzzle. When the bullets struck the Three-Lives Stone, they drilled in. Rows of bullets dotted out the words ‘An Tianzuo.’

“Old Zhao, you are in charge of commandeering this area. Everyone, stay put and wait for our return.” As An Tianzuo spoke, he walked towards the Bridge of Helplessness.

“Overseer...” Lu Bushun and An Jingyu wanted to say something, but An Tianzuo stopped them with a wave of his hand.

“It’s an order,” An Tianzuo said as he walked to the Bridge of Helplessness.

As he walked, the robot-like creature had already transformed into armor that enveloped his body.

“What’s that?” Zhou Wen looked at An Tianzuo in surprise.

When the armor enveloped his body, An Tianzuo’s figure had already vanished from the eyes of ordinary people. Only Zhou Wen could still see him. Without a doubt, this was the result of his Terror transformation.

However, An Tianzuo himself didn’t undergo Terror transformation. Instead, the transformation came from the robot-like creature that was in the form of an armor.

If it was a Guardian, it would be understandable. However, it wasn’t a Guardian. There was no Guardian’s aura.

In fact, Zhou Wen had seen An Tianzuo use something similar in the past. It was likely his Life Soul, but this Life Soul was very different from before. This difference wasn’t completely due to the Terror transformation. There seemed to be other factors mixed in.

Could it be that An Tianzuo didn’t use the Mythical Serum, but allowed his Life Soul to fuse with something similar to the Mythical Serum? Zhou Wen guessed, but he wasn’t able to verify his guess.

“Overseer, I’ll go first. You can come up later.” An Sheng hurriedly ran over, hoping to step onto the Bridge of Helplessness before An Tianzuo.

However, a spoon stopped them. The white-haired granny held a bowl of soup in her other hand and said expressionlessly, “You must drink the River of Forgetfulness Soup before stepping onto the Bridge of Helplessness.”

Without any hesitation, An Sheng took the bowl and glanced at the billowing yellow smoke in the bowl. He raised it to his mouth and swallowed all the yellow smoke.

An Tianzuo looked at An Sheng from the side without stopping him. Zhou Wen, on the other hand, was extremely nervous.

An Sheng waited for a while and after confirming that he hadn’t lost his memories, he said to An Tianzuo, “Overseer, I’m fine. My memories are still intact. Overseer, I’ll step onto the bridge first. You can step onto the bridge when I reach the opposite bank without any problems.”

With that said, An Sheng stepped onto the Bridge of Helplessness and carefully walked towards the opposite bank.

Every few steps An Sheng took, he would turn his head and shout. However, Zhou Wen and company could only see him open his mouth without hearing anything. It was merely a short distance, but it was as though an invisible barrier had screened his voice.

The Bridge of Helplessness was an arched bridge. When An Sheng reached the highest point of the bridge, his body suddenly vanished as though he had stepped into another world.

When An Tianzuo saw this, he picked up a bowl of River of Forgetfulness Soup and downed it in one gulp. He turned to look at Zhou Wen and said, “Don’t risk Ya’er’s life. Leave her here.”

With that said, An Tianzuo walked onto the Bridge of Helplessness.

Zhou Wen didn’t let go of Ya’er. Although An Tianzuo said it for Ya’er’s sake, Zhou Wen still believed that it was safer to keep Ya’er by his side.

Zhou Wen reached out to get the River of Forgetfulness Soup, but to his surprise, his hand was blocked by the white-haired granny’s spoon.

“What are you doing?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

An Tianzuo also stopped and looked at the white-haired granny. Lu Bushun and company also surrounded her.

“You don’t have to drink it,” the white-haired granny said expressionlessly as she retracted her spoon.

“I can step onto the bridge without drinking the soup?” Zhou Wen looked at the white-haired granny in puzzlement. Lu Bushun and company were also puzzled.

“Yes,” the white-haired granny answered.

“Why?” Zhou Wen asked.

“There’s no reason. You can choose not to step onto it if you don’t want to.” The white-haired granny still had that dead expression as though nothing was worthy of her being moved. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. If he had known that he didn’t need to drink the River of Forgetfulness Soup, he wouldn’t have gone through so much trouble to leave his name on the Three-Lives Stone.

“What about her?” Zhou Wen pointed at Ya’er in his arms.

The white-haired granny didn’t say a word as she handed over a bowl of River of Forgetfulness Soup.

Ya’er looked like a child, but her soul wasn’t. Without waiting for Zhou Wen to say anything, she took the River of Forgetfulness Soup and drank it in one mouthful.

An Tianzuo didn’t immediately continue forward. He watched Ya’er finish the River of Forgetfulness Soup without losing her memories before turning to walk to the other side of the bridge.

“If there’s any danger, head back,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan.

“Don’t worry. I’ll run faster than anyone if there’s danger,” Li Xuan said with a smile.

“Then I’m relieved.” He turned around and carried Ya’er onto the Bridge of Helplessness.

To his surprise, not long after Zhou Wen went up the bridge, the antelope and Chick followed. The white-haired granny glanced at them and didn’t stop them or get them to drink the River of Forgetfulness Soup.

Chick landed on Zhou Wen’s shoulder as the antelope slowly followed behind him. It looked like it was on a vacation as it occasionally looked at the River of Forgetfulness under the bridge.

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He never expected the antelope to follow him. He had no idea what it was up to.

Seeing Zhou Wen walk on the Bridge of Helplessness with the bird and antelope, Lu Bushun and company’s expressions turned odd.

Lu Bushun couldn’t help but run to the bridge’s end. He squeezed out a smile on his fat face and asked the white-haired granny, “Well, Granny, if they can cross the bridge without drinking the River of Forgetfulness Soup, can we do the same?”

The white-haired granny ignored him and tapped the bowl with her spoon. The meaning was obvious—if he wanted to step onto the bridge, he had to drink the soup first.

“That’s not fair. Why do we have to drink the soup when they can choose not to?” Lu Bushun deliberately said in an unhappy manner. In fact, he wanted to get the reason from the white-haired granny.

The white-haired granny rolled her eyes and smashed the spoon in her hand on Lu Bushun’s head, smashing his body into the mud. Only his head was exposed like a radish planted in the ground.

“Do you think it’s fair now?” the white-haired granny asked coldly.

“It’s fair. It’s very fair.” Unable to move, Lu Bushun could only squeeze out a fawning smile and nod.

Zhou Wen walked onto the Bridge of Helplessness and looked into the River of Forgetfulness. The scenery he saw was different from the scene from the bank.

Under the bridge wasn’t a bottomless abyss, nor was there any billowing yellow smoke. There was only a small river below. The river water was clear, and it wasn’t deep. However, beneath the bridge were piles of bones that covered the riverbed. It was like hell.

From the outside, it looked like there was no end to the bridge, but when he really stepped onto it, he realized that it wasn’t very long. Zhou Wen didn’t walk far before he reached the top of the bridge. Taking a step forward, the scene in front of him changed again.
