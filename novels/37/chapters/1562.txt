Chapter 1563: Fire-Elemental Defense Armor

Translator: CKtalon

Red flames immediately enveloped Zhou Wen’s body as the black armor clung tightly to his skin, perfectly outlining his muscular body.

On the black armor, there were some red crystal-like lines embedded, forming a crystalline pattern. The flames enveloped the armor, making Zhou Wen look like a flaming dark rider from the abyss.

It looks pretty good, but I wonder how useful it is. I hope that this one without Fire Elemental Affinity can withstand it.?Zhou Wen launched the dungeon and entered Dubhe with the Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queen.

The high temperature of Dubhe was enough to burn ordinary Mythical creatures to ashes. It was indeed difficult for Mythical armor to protect two Epic humans.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t have high requirements. As long as the Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queen could last for two to three seconds, it would be enough to prevent Liz and Leem from being killed by the high temperature.

At the instant he entered Dubhe, Zhou Wen, who was wearing the Fire-Runic Queen armor, felt the temperature instantly rise. However, the Fire-Runic Queen armor didn’t immediately melt. Instead, the flaming patterns on his body lit up as the flames on the armor’s exterior burned crazily.

The black parts of the armor were like red-hot metal pieces that suffused a slight red glow. However, not only did the temperature inside the armor not continue to rise, but it also slowly decreased.

Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. The effects of the Fire-Ruinc Divine Armor Queen were much better than expected. It lived up as a fire-elemental resistant armor. Such an effect was probably comparable to a fire-elemental Terror-grade armor.

This wasn’t exactly surprising. Typical fire-elemental armor only had one or two fire-elemental defensive skills. It was almost impossible to find one which had every attribute being fire-elemental.

Although the temperature inside is still a little high, it should still be within the limits of an Epic stage human, right?

?Zhou Wen felt that he could return to Earth this time.

However, before that, Zhou Wen had to confirm if Demonic Neonate was considered a human. If she wasn’t, Zhou Wen needed to find another human and fuse another Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queen.

He took Demonic Neonate to the Cube and stabbed Demonic Neonate’s finger with a needle, dripping a drop of blood. The blood dripped onto the Cube and was immediately absorbed by it. The Cube lit up as the number ‘3’ appeared. Clearly, it required the blood of three creatures to truly activate it.

Since Demonic Neonate is considered a person, that’s simple. I can return to Earth now.?After Zhou Wen returned to the cemetery, he summoned Liz and Leem over.

“If I were to go somewhere very, very far away, perhaps never to return, are you willing to follow me?” Zhou Wen asked the two girls.

Although Zhou Wen could have taken them away without saying a word, he didn’t wish to do so.

After all, this was their home. The chances of them returning in the future were slim. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to force them if they were unwilling to leave. In fact, there was no need to force them. With Regretless City’s present situation, as long as Zhou Wen threw out some bait, many people would definitely be willing to return to Earth with him.

Leaving this place could even be considered an opportunity for Liz and Leem.

Of course, Zhou Wen still hoped that Liz and Leem would return with him. This was because their Life Providences and Life Souls were somewhat special. They would be of help to Zhou Wen when he built the city in the future.

Liz’s Life Providence was Goddess of Blessing, while her Life Soul was Blessing Halo. As for Leem’s Life Providence, it was Goddess of Curses, and her Life Soul was Curse Halo. One would receive a huge boost when the former used a blessing-type skill, while the other’s curse would attain terrifying levels.

The two of them were practically born for large-scale battles. One could bless their allies while the other could curse their enemies. They were a perfect match.

The premise was that they were willing to follow Zhou Wen. If they were tricked to join him, they might fall out with Zhou Wen after seeing what kind of world was out there on Earth. It wouldn’t be worth it.

“Master, our lives are yours. You can take us anywhere.” To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Liz and Leem answered firmly without any hesitation.

“Go back and prepare. Say farewell to your family and friends before leaving with me. If you haven’t thought it through, you don’t have to return. I won’t blame you,” Zhou Wen said.

Liz and Leem exchanged looks as Leem said, “Master, please wait. We’ll be right back.”

“Regardless of whether you return or not, tell your City Lord to come over,” Zhou Wen added.

After the two girls agreed, they left the cemetery. Zhou Wen turned to look at the two graves. After some hesitation, he decided not to touch the puppets below.

“Have you really decided to return using the Cube?” Grim Demon still hoped to wait for Demonic Neonate to wake up.

“I’ve already decided. Come back,” Zhou Wen said.

Grim Demon knew that it was impossible for him to convince Zhou Wen, so he obediently returned to the Demonic Sword.

Zhou Wen placed the sheathed Demonic Sword in Demonic Neonate’s arms and waited for the City Lord to arrive. Furthermore, he also wanted to know if Liz and Leem would return.

Liz and Leem came to the cemetery with the City Lord. The City Lord knelt on the ground and said with tears in his eyes, “Your Devilish Excellency, are you returning to Lost Paradise? Did we do something wrong? If so, please punish me. Don’t abandon us, your citizens!”

“You did nothing wrong. It’s just that it’s time for me to return,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“I see. Then please take Liz and Leem with you and let them serve you in our stead…” the City Lord immediately said.

“Then I’ll take them along.” Zhou Wen agreed, having never planned on rejecting the offer.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it wouldn’t be nice if he didn’t leave anything behind after taking away two extremely talented people.

Furthermore, the humans here had a very difficult time surviving. They didn’t even stand a chance.

“You should already know what a Companion Beast is, right?” Zhou Wen asked the City Lord.

“What Companion Beast?” The City Lord was taken aback.

Zhou Wen could tell that his expression wasn’t faked as he looked at Liz and Leem in surprise. He was somewhat puzzled as to why they hadn’t told the City Lord about Companion Beasts.

“Without your permission, we won’t leak anything regarding you,” Liz and Leem said seriously.

“Very good.” Zhou Wen was very satisfied with their performance, so he got them to explain what Companion Beasts were.

“I’ll bestow you a Companion Beast, giving you the ability to fight ordinary dimensional creatures,” Zhou Wen said after the City Lord got a better understanding.

“Your Devilish Excellency, can you bestow a Companion Beast to my clansmen?” To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the City Lord said such words.

“Why?” Zhou Wen asked the City Lord. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Because I’m already old and don’t have much time to live. Your Excellency, you are giving us hope. I hope to leave it to the most promising youth in Regretless City. That will be our future,” said the City Lord.

“Alright, summon him over.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly. This City Lord was indeed not bad.. At the very least, he wasn’t a selfish person.
