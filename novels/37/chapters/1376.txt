Chapter 1377: I Need Help

“Your Excellency.” Blood Shaman, Uesugi Nao, and Cave Era immediately bowed when they saw Immortal walking over.

Jiang Yan passed by the three of them and walked to the fence. He looked up at a pillar in the middle of Skysplit Tower. The pillar was made of metal and crystal. Although it was erected in the middle of Skysplit Tower, its current height had exceeded the completed seventh floor.

Jiang Yan stood by the fence on the seventh floor. He had to look up at the Heavenly Ascension Platform to barely see its peak.

“Your Excellency, it should be completed in twenty days at the current progress,” Uesugi Nao said from behind.

“That’s too late,” Jiang Yan muttered to himself.

“Your Excellency, taking another twenty days makes it only twenty-seven days. It won’t even be a month,” Uesugi Nao said in puzzlement.

Jiang Yan didn’t explain as he said calmly, “All of you can leave. Guard Skysplit Tower outside and don’t let anyone approach.”

The three of them were alarmed as Blood Shaman hurriedly asked, “Your Excellency, what happened?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Go. Just guard it well,” Jiang Yan said indifferently as he looked at the Heavenly Ascension Platform without explaining.

“Yes.” With Jiang Yan saying that, Uesugi Nao and company didn’t dare ask further as they left Skysplit Tower together.

Before walking down from the seventh floor, Cave Era looked at Jiang Yan as though she wanted to say something, but she ultimately didn’t. She followed Blood Shaman and company down Skysplit Tower.

Although Jiang Yan didn’t say anything, they knew that something must have happened. Otherwise, Immortal wouldn’t have said that. Therefore, they immediately gathered all the Guardians in Skysplit Tower and began setting up defenses around it.

After all the people who had rebuilt Skysplit Tower left, Jiang Yan walked to the bottom of the huge heavenly pillar and climbed the steps that surrounded the stone pillar, walking towards the top of the Heavenly Ascension Platform.

Now, only a third of the Heavenly Ascension Platform had been built. The highest point was still under construction, but when Jiang Yan arrived at the highest point, he could already look down at his surroundings.

There’s too little time. Although ascending to the heavens in a single step is difficult, I can only give it a try.?Jiang Yan looked up into the void, and on the forehead of the Guardian armor he wore, there was a crystal that was as mysterious as a vertical eye that emitted a strange light.

The crystal that resembled an eye seemed to be an endless abyss. Any ray of light that landed on it would be absorbed. However, it emitted a faint light that resembled tentacles. When the light reached it, it was like hair-like tentacles stabbing into the void.

The unfinished pillar at Jiang Yan’s feet came into contact with the tentacle-like beam. The crystal embedded in the metal that looked like a pattern gradually lit up.

As the sky above the Heavenly Ascension Platform lit up, the crystal that resembled an eye on Jiang Yan’s forehead became darker. As for the tentacle-like rays of light, they increased in number, spreading out like countless transparent strands of hair. They filled the void and spread to unknown areas.

The rays of light would flash with strange streams of light from time to time, like cables that transmitted signals. The stronger the light from the Heavenly Ascension Platform, the stronger the streams of light.

As for Jiang Yan, he seemed to be enduring extreme pain as his body involuntarily trembled slightly. His eyes were bloodshot and even the capillaries under his skin began to rupture.

Blood Shaman and company, who were guarding outside Skysplit Tower, were alarmed when they saw the Heavenly Ascension Platform glowing brightly, but the top seemed to be enveloped by darkness.

“We’ve only completed a third of the Heavenly Ascension Platform, so its effects are greatly discounted. Isn’t it too risky for Lord Immortal to use it to contact the dimension?” Blood Shaman exclaimed.

“In order to contact the dimension, one needs to pay a huge price with energy. Skysplit Tower itself is an energy-gathering device, while the Heavenly Ascension Platform is like a signal amplifier. Even without the energy-gathering effects of Skysplit Tower, as long as one has enough energy, one can use the Heavenly Ascension Platform’s signal amplification ability to contact the dimension. However, even if there’s an amplification effect, one needs extremely potent energy to succeed. Now, there’s only a third or even lower magnification effect. It’s difficult to say if the signal can be sent to the dimension. If something goes wrong and the energy isn’t sent out, Lord Immortal will be in danger if the energy rebounds on him,” Uesugi Nao said worriedly.

Cave Era seemed to have already figured out what Jiang Yan was up to. At that moment, she was the calmest person.

“Since Lord Immortal dares to do so, he naturally has his own plans. Let’s guard Skysplit Tower and not let anyone disturb him, lest we fail, bringing everything to naught.” Cave Era knew that Jiang Yan’s words weren’t without reason.

Uesugi Nao and Blood Shaman nodded slightly and increased their vigilance. At the same time, they informed the headquarters to transfer the high-level Guardians stationed at the headquarters.

Now, even if the headquarters of the League of Guardians was flattened, it wouldn’t be a loss.

…

On the Heavenly Ascension Platform, cracks began to appear on Jiang Yan’s Guardian armor. As his body suffered the terrifying power that seeped through the cracks, his skin rapidly turned gray. His originally crystalline skin instantly turned to dust as specks flew out with the spatial fluctuations.

The Heavenly Ascension Platform hadn’t been completed. It wasn’t as simple as only having a third of its operational effects. The incomplete Heavenly Ascension Platform was extremely harmful to the user.

Jiang Yan ignored his body that was turning gray as he continued staring at the void that was penetrated by the light.

Kacha!

Cracks appeared on the crystal on the Guardian’s forehead. This was due to the direct impact of the Heavenly Ascension Platform’s amplification.

Please, it’ll be done soon. Hold on a little longer.?Jiang Yan prayed silently.

However, the cracks on the crystal continued to increase. Soon, they filled the entire crystal. The crystal was like a glass ball that had been burned by fire before being soaked in cold water. Countless cracks crisscrossed. With just a little more energy, it would instantly disintegrate.

Just a little more… Just a little more…?Jiang Yan stared intently into the void. At the spot where his armor had cracked, the exposed parts of his body had already turned gray and revealed white bones, but he still didn’t notice anything.

Suddenly, a strange light spread out from the spot where the light penetrated, forming a humanoid figure of light. It was as though a god that couldn’t be stared at by humans had descended.

“Jiang Yan, is this the answer you are giving me?” The figure looked down from above and coldly stared at the unfinished Skysplit Tower and Heavenly Ascension Platform.

“I’ve encountered some trouble and need help,” Jiang Yan said.

“I’ve given you enough help. If I need to resolve everything myself, what else do I need you for? Are you telling me that I need another representative in the human world?” the figure of light said coldly.
