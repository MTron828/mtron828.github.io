Chapter 1616 Heaven Man Smite

Professor Gu was caught up in his excitement explaining, but the scene he saw was far from what he had expected. He couldn’t continue after a few words.

He originally imagined that Deceit King’s situation wouldn’t be good, but from the scene, Deceit King was fighting three alone. He had his saber in his right hand and scabbard in his left while blocking the attacks of the three Saints. Furthermore, he didn’t look to be in trouble at all. His movement techniques were elegant like an immortal’s. Every move he made looked elegant and composed without any signs of being forced. “How is this happening?” Professor Gu was somewhat dumbfounded. It wasn’t just Professor Gu. The audience watching the program was also somewhat dumbfounded. They had already seen the combat strength of Jiuyang and company. Ignoring Jiuyang and Old K, just Xiao alone gave off an unstoppable feeling

They were clearly virtually invincible, but when they fought Zhou Wen, they didn’t show any of the strength and dominance they previously had. Instead, they appeared bounded.

“This is fake, right?”

“Are the three Saints holding back?”

Everyone secretly suspected. The present Xiao, Jiuyang, and Old K didn’t look as impressive as before. It was as though they had turned from invincible kings to amateurs who could only circle around the periphery. Thinking of Xiao’s violent thrashing of Liu Yun, it was difficult not to suspect that they were going easy on Deceit King.

However, truly perceptive experts didn’t think so.

Xiao and Jiuyang’s standards didn’t decrease. They even performed better than in the previous battle, but they still failed to suppress Deceit King

Now, Deceit King’s movement technique was extremely bizarre. Under the siege of the trio, he seemed to be walking leisurely. He was neither anxious nor pressed. His body was like the wind as he easily dodged most of the attacks. Even if he couldn’t dodge them, he would block using his Bamboo Blade and scabbard.

The attacks of Jiuyang and company didn’t seem to put any pressure on him at all. Instead, every casual swing of the Deceit King’s saber seemed to give Jiuyang and company immense pressure. They had no choice but to treat it seriously and even retreat. Every strike seemed to target their most feared weakness.

“This person’s saber art has probably reached the point of Heaven Man Smite!” Zhang Chunqiu exclaimed.

“What do you mean?” Xia Liuchuan didn’t understand what Zhang Chunqiu’s adjective meant.

He knew about Heaven Man Unity, but he had never heard of Heaven Man Smite.

Zhang Chunqiu explained, “You can understand it as a public outrage. Even God can’t stand it and wants to destroy him.”

In Guide City, Li Xuan and company were also watching the battle. Feng Qiuyan’s eyes lit up as his face alternated between worry and joy. At times, he frowned in thought, and at times, he was overjoyed. At times, his face was filled with puzzlement and confusion.

“I originally thought that my saber art was slowly approaching Coach. But from what I’m seeing today, I realize that there’s still a huge gap. From the looks of it, I haven’t worked hard enough,” Feng Qiuyan muttered to himself.

“Coach, when are you going to use some sword techniques? I really want to see how he uses a sword,” Ming Xiu said.

The female sword immortal, Qin Zhen, fixated her eyes on Zhou Wen, afraid that she would miss any detail.

Among the three of them, she had gained the most insights. This was because she had learned Transcendent Flying Immortal to begin with. And now, Zhou Wen had pushed the Immortal in Transcendent Flying Immortal to its limits, allowing Qin Zhen to comprehend many things that she had never thought of before.

Li Xuan wasn’t very interested in saber techniques. He only found Zhou Wen’s saber techniques very powerful and his movement techniques very strong. He was elegant and truly like an immortal.

“Professor Gu, it looks like Deceit King really doesn’t need to use Companion Beasts, right?” Su Yi’s eyes shimmered as her face was filled with excitement.

Although Deceit King’s reputation wasn’t as good as Human Sovereign’s, he was still a representative of humanity. Without a contract with a Guardian, he had no connection to the Holy Land. Su Yi hoped that Deceit King could obtain victory.

“Yes, it does look interesting. Deceit King’s Strength, Speed, and saber arts are surprisingly strong…”

“Cut it out, Professor Gu. I’m willing to confer you the Greatest Jinx of All Heavens.”

“I never expected that. Professor Gu, you’re really impressive.”

“You’re such a jinx… You’re such a jinx… You’re such a jinxed jinx…”

“In the future, if anyone dares to say that Professor Gu isn’t a jinx, I’ll spit in his face.”

“Haha, Professor Gu is innocent. No one expected Deceit King to be this strong. He’s practically a sicko!”

Professor Gu’s nickname of Jinx probably couldn’t be washed away. Zhou Wen could fight the three of them because he had to thank the Limitless Demon Dragon King armor and the eight Companion Beasts. The power the eight Companion Beasts provided him, especially Truth Listener, the Golden Wyrm Scissors, and Demonic Neonate, was unimaginably powerful. With their combined strength, Zhou Wen’s Strength and Speed could almost reach the Heaven level.

Although he had only touched the threshold, Xiao, Jiuyang, and company had also used Holy Artifacts to reach the Heaven level. They were inferior to true Heaven-level existences. They, too, had only touched the threshold. Under such circumstances, Zhou Wen was at the same starting point as the three of them.

To be able to fight three alone, other than giving credit to the mysterious effects of The Disqualified and the Teacher Domain, it was also thanks to Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal which had also reached an extremely high realm.

In terms of realm, Transcendent Flying Immortal was no longer inferior to a true Heaven-level existence. Even a top Heaven-level existence might not be stronger than Transcendent Flying Immortal.

Furthermore, as the battle continued, Transcendent Flying Immortal continued transforming. His movement techniques and saber techniques became more and more elegant and ghostly. Everyone was alarmed to discover that despite the three Saints besieging Zhou Wen, they felt that the trio were the ones in danger as though they would be killed by him at any moment.

Xiao and Jiuyang could still match Zhou Wen in terms of technique and realm, but Old K was lacking in this aspect. He relied on the Holy Artifact—the scepter—to block Zhou Wen’s attack.

Although Zhou Wen had the upper hand, it was still impossible for him to completely break through the trio’s siege. He only had an advantage, not an overwhelming advantage.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush. He was fighting, but also practicing. Transcendent Flying Immortal was transforming. He had already vaguely touched a new realm, but it was only a tiny sliver. It was still unknown if he could fully comprehend it.

Apart from practicing Transcendent Flying Immortal, the Teacher Domain had also been gathering the trajectories of Jiuyang and company’s powers. It was a trajectory that only Heaven-level perfect domains could leave behind in the Teacher Domain.

Previously, the trajectory left behind by the void lightning had condensed into the Great Void Lightning Art-an Essence Energy Art. Although Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to study it carefully, he knew that it was definitely not bad. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Now, the trajectories left behind by Jiuyang and company were constantly made complete. Perhaps they could condense an Essence Energy Art as well.
