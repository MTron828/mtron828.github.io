Chapter 973: Dracotaur Bloodline

Translator: CKtalon

At this moment, a clam maiden walked into the palace and bowed to the man. “Master, everything is normal at Sea God Reef. Qin Ling has been residing in the sunken ship and hasn’t left.”

This is that Dragon Granny, right? Zhou Wen thought.

The man nodded slightly. “Watch her. I don’t want any more accidents.”

Dragon Granny glanced at the Seven Seas Dragon King and said in a seductive tone, “Master, that Zhou Wen is Wang Mingyuan’s disciple after all. If we kill him like this, I’m afraid it will be disadvantageous to your plan if Wang Mingyuan comes looking for trouble.”

The man said coldly, “So what if it’s Wang Mingyuan? He was nowhere when I dominated the Federation. Even if he was lucky and became the Dragon Gods’ lord, it was just a moment of luck. When my plan succeeds, the Dragon Gods’ lord will be nothing. Both humans and dragons will acknowledge me as their master.”

“How should we deal with Miya? If she hadn’t revealed the details of the other dragon monarchs, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been able to kill them so easily,” Dragon Granny asked carefully. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Qin Ling is still with her. Don’t worry about her for now. However, to prevent any problems from developing, we need to let Qin Ling mature as soon as possible and extract her Dracotaur bloodline.”

As the man spoke, he took out an item and threw it to Dragon Granny. He sneered and said, “Take this to the sunken ship and let Qin Ling eat it. In less than six months, her Dracotaur bloodline will be of use. When the time comes, all humans will be transformed into Dracotaurs. It’s useless even if the other Guardians win. Earth will forever be mine.”

“I’ll do it now.” Dragon Granny took the items and bowed before leaving the hall.

Zhou Wen was alarmed when he heard that. This person is even more ruthless than Teacher and Jing Daoxian. Teacher only brought a portion of people into the dimension, while Jing Daoxian only experiments on talented people. This fellow actually wants to turn all humans into Dracotaurs. He’s too crazy. From his tone, he seems to be a high-ranking member of the Federation a long time ago. Who is he?

Upon realizing that Dragon Granny had already gone to Sea God Reef, Zhou Wen was somewhat anxious. However, he could only help himself now. He couldn’t even rush out of the Seven Seas Dragon King’s stomach, so it was even more impossible to inform Qin Ling.

“Go. Guard the Seven Dragons Sea well and don’t let any outsiders come into contact with Qin Ling.” The man waved his hand and gestured for the Seven Seas Dragon King to leave.

...

Inside Sea God Reef, Qin Ling was talking to Miya.

“Sister, how can you trust a human so easily?” Qin Ling said.

Miya sighed and said, “It was a moment of bewitchment. I actually believed that he could defeat the Seven Seas Dragon King. Now, not only is the Seven Seas Dragon King alive, but even his life has been lost. If I had known, I would have insisted that he take you away from the Seven Dragons Sea.”

However, Qin Ling shook her head and said, “I won’t leave with any human. I’m not a human to begin with.”

Miya reached out to rub Qin Ling’s head and sighed. “If it wasn’t for the Seven Seas Dragon King, you could have stayed here forever, but not now. I have to think of a way to send you out of the Seven Dragons Sea. You have human bloodline in you, so you still have a chance of breaking the dimensional zones’ restrictions.”

“So what if I leave? Won’t I still be treated like a monster?” Qin Ling was ashen.

Feng Qiuyan already knew the truth about her, but he hadn’t appeared again. Qin Ling had already given up.

“Little Feng probably hasn’t thought it through yet. Give him some more time,” Miya said helplessly.

In fact, Miya couldn’t understand Qin Ling’s feelings. As she was a pure dragon, she didn’t think that there was anything wrong with being a dragon.

However, Qin Ling had half a human bloodline. Furthermore, she had grown up in human society. The other half of the dragon bloodline gave her immense pressure other than strength.

As the two of them were talking, a shrimp soldier reported, “Master, Dragon Granny is here.”

“Why is she here?” Miya thought for a moment and said to Qin Ling, “Stay here and don’t come out. I’ll go and see what Dragon Granny is doing here.”

With that said, Miya left the cabin. After arriving on the deck, she saw Dragon Granny floating in the seawater outside.

“Dragon Granny, why are you here instead of Infinite Island?” Miya asked coldly.

“Several dragon monarchs in the Seven Dragons Sea have been killed. The Dragon King asked me to come and see if you had encountered any trouble here and to provide you help if necessary.” As Dragon Granny spoke, she had already passed through the water curtain and landed on the deck.

“I appreciate your kindness, but there’s no trouble here. You can return,” Miya said expressionlessly.

“Why are you in such a hurry to chase me away? I heard that your human sister has returned. Why don’t I see her?” Dragon Granny asked with a smile.

“She’s not feeling well and is resting. Please return.” Miya didn’t have a good impression of Dragon Granny.

“I’m good at Essence Energy recovery. I can help her. Take me to her,” said Dragon Granny.

“Don’t let me personally send you off.” Miya stared at Dragon Granny, her voice already turning cold.

“You can give it a try.” Dragon Granny was still smiling and wasn’t angry at all.

Miya didn’t stand on ceremony as she threw a punch at Dragon Granny.

Miya had inherited the Golden Dragon King’s bloodline and strength. The might of this punch was extremely powerful. Even Tyrant Behemoth was nothing against it.

However, Dragon Granny wasn’t flustered. She took out a small rattle drum from the clamshell and shook it gently.

Suddenly, Miya lost all her strength. A golden incantation appeared on her neck like a necklace, strangling her neck as if it was about to snap.

Boom!

Miya revealed her Golden Dragon King body. The huge Golden Dragon Body rolled on the deck, but the golden incantation on her neck kept glowing. No matter how Miya struggled, she could not escape.

As the rattling of the rattle drum in Dragon Granny’s hand sped up, the incantation on Miya’s neck tightened. Miya was already paralyzed on the deck, her neck about to break.

“Sis, what’s wrong?” Qin Ling ran out and was shocked when she saw Miya. She wanted to help Miya remove the incantation on her neck.

However, just as her hand touched the incantation, it suddenly shrank, causing Miya extreme pain. However, she couldn’t make any sound. She was about to die.

The Turtle Minister rushed over with the shrimp soldiers and crab generals, but Dragon Granny only said indifferently, “If you want her to die, feel free to come.”

“What do you want?” Qin Ling stared at Dragon Granny and asked.

Dragon Granny opened the box in her hand and took out a crystal bottle inside. She handed it to Qin Ling. “Drink this and I’ll let her go.”

“What is it?” Qin Ling asked as she looked at the transparent liquid in the crystal bottle.

“Poison. A life for a life. Do you dare drink it?” Dragon Granny said with narrowed eyes.
