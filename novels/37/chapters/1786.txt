Chapter 1787 In the Human World

There was only that single palm under the sky.

Zhou Wen looked up, but all he could see was the palm. It was as if everything in the world was enveloped by that slender hand.

It literally blotted out the sky with one hand, coming from beyond the heavens. Even the heavens seemed like a toy to be manhandled.

There was nowhere to hide, much less escape.

Even the audience could sense the unparalleled pressure from the palm through their television screen. It was as if it was a hand of heaven that could crush them like ants.

Zhou Wen was iron-willed. He suddenly swung his left hand and stabbed the Immortal Peril Sword into the ground, holding the hilt of the Immortal Culling Sword with both hands.

The two swords had their own characteristics and could unleash different abilities, but he now needed to gather all his strength for a desperate strike. He couldn’t divert his strength anymore, so he could only give up on one sword and fight with one.

With both hands holding the Immortal Culling Sword, the strength in his body surged into the sword like a tsunami, causing the body of the Immortal Culling Sword to tremble non-stop from the influx of immense power. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhou Wen knew very well that using his strength to fight the peerless strike of Transcendent Immortal head-on was no different from throwing an egg at a rock.

It was the true power of the apocalypse-a power capable of destroying a world.

No matter how powerful a Calamity-grade powerhouse was, they were still limited to the confines of a world. If the world was destroyed, a calamity was nothing.

Only by breaking out of the world will I have a chance of survival. Under the earth-shattering pressure, Zhou Wen looked at her jade-like hand, but his expression was as calm as an ancient well.

......

After years of cultivation, Zhou Wen’s character had long been tempered to be as tough as steel. Even in the face of death, he could clearly weigh the pros and cons.

Images of his past cultivation flashed through his mind. The persistence of the First Order of Chaos, the artifice of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, the purity of the Qi Refinement Art, the bizarreness of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, the essence of the Dao Sutra, the illusions of the Godfiend Era, the countering of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, and the truth of the Demon God Inheritance Catalog.

Yet these paths that he had spent so much effort figuring out were all severed by himself.

There are 50 Great Daos, 49 come from heaven. The one removed is my Dao, and it’s also the Dao of Humanity… Zhou Wen’s heart burned more and more.

As a human, he didn’t need to be indifferent to everything, nor did he need to be one with the world, much less see past the mortal world.

Humans were humans. Since they were born into the world, they should live as themselves. They weren’t doing it for the heavens or the earth; they were only doing it for themselves.

As Transcendent Immortal’s palm pressed down, the entire temple produced cracking sounds. Deep cracks appeared on the eternally indelible wall of divine stones, like pythons intertwined.

The divine mountain trembled as if it would collapse at any moment under the immense pressure of the palm.

The destructive power made people’s hearts palpitate as they stared at the sword-wielding Zhou Wen, the unease in their hearts intensifying despite them praying countless times for him to withstand the palm strike.

Zhou Wen’s figure and the sword in his hand appeared tiny beneath the palm. They were so small that they were almost negligible.

“Regardless of whether you are Zhou Wen or Human Sovereign, in my opinion, you are nothing more than fleeting clouds. Your life and death are in my hands.” Transcendent Immortal’s voice was like the voice of the Heavenly Dao as it surged from all directions and echoed for a long time, capable of destroying one’s soul.

Bang!

The huge divine stone pillars outside the temple collapsed one after another under the palm’s pressure like rotten wood shavings.

“To escape the Three Realms and not be confined to the Five Elements, an immortal beyond the heavens is lawless.” The sword in Zhou Wen’s hand lowered as he looked up at the heavens and slowly chanted.

“Not bad. To be able to understand the true gap between you and me, I guess you can die in peace,” Transcendent Immortal said calmly as she continued pressing down with her palm, about to crush Zhou Wen.

“Unfortunately, that’s only your delusion. It’s sad and lamentable. If there’s still an area beyond the heavens, it won’t be that. So what if you’ve escaped the Three Realms and not confined to the Five Elements? I’ll let you know that you’re still… in… the human… world.” As he spoke, Zhou Wen held the Immortal Culling Sword with both hands and counterattacked with a mighty strike.

As the Immortal Culling Sword rose, Zhou Wen’s body and sword emitted light. It wasn’t intense, but it was dazzling.

It was like a phoenix that had been reborn from fire and was undergoing a transformation. With the appearance of the light, Zhou Wen and the sword underwent a transformation, but it also seemed to be burning. When the sword tore through space and met Transcendent Immortal’s palm, Zhou Wen’s body and sword seemed to have completely turned into light, turning into a blazing white projection.

When the sword and palm collided, there was no dazzling explosion of light, nor was there a shockwave that tore through everything. There were no sparks as expected, nor was there an earth-shattering collapse.

The blade struck the flesh, slicing open the flesh on his palm, and blood flowed down the blade.

“I-impossible…” Transcendent Immortal’s face twisted, and her eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.

The full-powered strike of an Apocalypse-grade force was actually cracked open by Zhou Wen. She couldn’t accept such a ridiculous outcome, regardless.

Transcendent Immortal’s five fingers suddenly contracted as she gripped the sword, allowing the flesh on her five fingers to be sliced open. The blade sank into her bones, and blood splattered.

She struck out with her other hand again, hoping to kill him on the spot.

Zhou Wen was already prepared and was about to forcefully summon Demonic Neonate to help him withstand the fatal strike.

But before Zhou Wen could summon Demonic Neonate, Transcendent Immortal’s palm suddenly stopped. Her pupils constricted strangely as if she had encountered something unexpected and extremely terrifying

Zhou Wen’s gaze went past Transcendent Immortal’s face and saw a familiar face.

“Teacher…” Zhou Wen was slightly stunned.

The white-robed person behind Transcendent Immortal was none other than Wang Mingyuan.

At this moment, Wang Mingyuan had a calm expression and was filled with vigor. He didn’t look like he was about to die from his serious injuries at all. He stood behind Transcendent Immortal and pressed a palm on her head. His five fingers were like hooks that stabbed into her skull.

Although he couldn’t see anything, Zhou Wen could sense that the strength in Transcendent Immortal was rapidly flowing away.

In the blink of an eye, Zhou Wen couldn’t sense the strength coming from Transcendent Immortal’s hand that was gripping the sword.

Zhou Wen stared blankly at Transcendent Immortal and Wang Mingyuan behind her. He saw that the former’s vitality was almost drained, and her entire body hung down like an old willow branch in the wind. If Wang Mingyuan hadn’t grabbed her head, she would’ve probably fallen to the ground.

“You… You…” Like a dying old man who couldn’t even speak properly, Transcendent Immortal weakly said the word ‘you’ before her head suddenly exploded like a watermelon.

Wang Mingyuan’s fingers were stained with blood as he looked at the headless corpse as if he were looking at trash. “Zhou Wen, you did well.” Wang Mingyuan took out a white handkerchief and wiped the blood off his fingers, allowing the white handkerchief to drift away with the wind. Then, he smiled at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen looked at the damaged temple, and his expression changed drastically when he saw the situation.
