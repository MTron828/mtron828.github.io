Chapter 1375: Clear Plan

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen and Sweetie sneaked to the headquarters of the League of Guardians.

Under Zhou Wen’s persuasion and lies, Sweetie ended up tempted. She hid herself and followed Zhou Wen to the headquarters of the League of Guardians.

Zhou Wen still needed to hide along the way, but it was easy for Sweetie. As long as she didn’t want anyone to see her, no one could see her.

How strange. Why isn’t Sweetie’s strength suppressed on Earth??Sweetie’s potent abilities puzzled Zhou Wen.

Logically speaking, it shouldn’t have been like this. A Calamity-grade would be suppressed on Earth. If Sweetie was really an Apocalypse-grade big shot, she should be suppressed even more.

However, no matter how Zhou Wen looked at it, Sweetie didn’t seem to be suppressed by the rules.

The headquarters of the League of Guardians was huge. It was already considered a city. Many humans who had contracted Guardians could be seen coming and going.

Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array wasn’t strong enough to envelop such a huge city, so he could only enter its core first. He originally wanted to use the Invisibility Cloak to sneak in, but he felt that it wouldn’t work.

The Invisibility Cloak was only at the Mythical stage after all. There were many Terror-grade Guardians here, so it was difficult to guarantee that no one could see him.

After some thought, Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate. “te, get Grim Demon out.”

With a thought, Demonic Neonate automatically unsheathed the Demonic Sword in her arms. Grim Demon also flew out.

“Grim Demon, you should be able to transform into a Guardian armor and possess me, right?” Zhou Wen looked at Grim Demon and asked with uncertainty.

Typical Guardians could transform into armor, but Grim Demon had never done so. He was always inside the Demonic Sword, so Zhou Wen wasn’t sure.

“Yes, I can, but you haven’t contracted with me and can’t use my power,” Grim Demon said smugly. “Why? Do you need to use my power having encountered something that can’t be resolved? Didn’t I tell you so? If you had contracted with me back then… Of course… I wouldn’t have taken a fancy to you…”

“Cut the crap. Just transform into armor and attach yourself to me.” Zhou Wen glared at him.

Grim Demon naturally didn’t care if Zhou Wen glared at him, but when he turned his head and saw Demonic Neonate glaring at him, he immediately cowered. He smiled apologetically and said, “Of course. I’ll do it immediately.”

With that said, Grim Demon transformed into armor and enveloped Zhou Wen’s body.

A black armor enveloped Zhou Wen’s body, making his slender and muscular body exude strength. It was as though he could shoot out like a cannonball with a single step.

“Piece of cake.” Zhou Wen decided to swagger into the League of Guardians.

After unsummoning Demonic Neonate, Zhou Wen led Sweetie to the entrance that resembled a toll booth on a highway. That was the only way to enter the League of Guardians. Unless Zhou Wen forcefully barged in, he had to go through there.

As for using instant transmission, Zhou Wen didn’t believe that with Cave Era and Jiuyue around, they would allow anyone to teleport into the headquarters of the League of Guardians.

As there were many humans who had contracted Guardians entering and exiting, Zhou Wen felt that there shouldn’t be too much of a problem since he was wearing authentic Guardian armor.

“See that? There are solutions to everything. You don’t have to force it. It’s not easy for me to sneak in. You still have a lot to learn.” Zhou Wen walked among the Guardians and no one paid attention to him. There were people wearing Guardian armor everywhere. Zhou Wen was inconspicuous, so he happily lectured Sweetie.

However, just as he entered, he heard an ear-piercing alarm.

Instantly, the Guardians around him looked over. The Guardians in charge of sentry duty also surrounded Zhou Wen. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Where’s your pass?” one of the guards asked Zhou Wen with an unfriendly expression.

Zhou Wen cursed inwardly. He never expected the League of Guardians to have such high-tech stuff. He was secretly depressed.?Why are a bunch of Guardians dabbling with high-tech stuff? There’s actually such a thing as an entry pass!?

Sweetie’s face turned red from holding back her laughter. However, she ultimately failed to hold it in and laughed out loud.

However, no matter how she laughed, no one else reacted other than Zhou Wen. It was as though they couldn’t see Sweetie at all.

Zhou Wen had no choice. There was no time for him to get the entry card now. Since he had already been exposed, he planned on rushing in.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to take action, he heard a person squeeze out from the crowd beside him. As he squeezed over, he said, “Sorry, his entry pass is with me. I was holding it for him. I forgot to return it to him when I returned.”

As the person spoke, he stuffed a card into Zhou Wen’s hand.

Zhou Wen caught the card and the shrill alarm immediately stopped.

“Be careful next time. Don’t randomly leave the entry pass around. If anything happens, you won’t even know how you died.” The leading guard saw that the entry passes on Zhou Wen and the person were fine, so all he did was lecture them.

“I’m so sorry,” the person apologized.

“Alright, go in. Don’t delay others from entering.” Only then did the guard let them in.

Zhou Wen followed the person in. When they came to an area with fewer people and no one was paying attention to them, Zhou Wen approached the person and lowered his voice. He asked in puzzlement, “Jiang Yan, why are you here?”

The person who helped Zhou Wen out was none other than Jiang Yan, one of Wang Mingyuan’s students when Zhou Wen was learning from him.

Jiang Yan said, “I contracted a Guardian, so I’m naturally considered a member of the League of Guardians. I’m now doing some idle work in the headquarters. As for you, you are one of the League of Guardians’ greatest enemies. Why didn’t you stay in Luoyang? Why did you come here yourself?”

“Thankfully, you are here. If it wasn’t for you, I would be in trouble.” Zhou Wen was telling the truth.

Although he wasn’t afraid of the League of Guardians and it wasn’t difficult for him to escape, he wouldn’t be able to set up the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array ahead of time if he was discovered ahead of time. It would also make the League of Guardians wary. It wouldn’t be easy to attack again.

“You’re my junior brother after all. I can’t just ignore you when I notice that you’re in danger.” Jiang Yan smiled and said, “No matter what you’re doing here, you have to be careful. It’s beyond imagination how many Terror-grade Guardians are here. If anything happens, it won’t be easy to escape.”

“I didn’t plan on fighting those Guardians to the death,” Zhou Wen said to Jiang Yan. “What do you do in the League of Guardians? If you encounter an enemy attack, will you fight?”

“I’m not a guard. I’m just a clerk. Under normal circumstances, I don’t have to fight,” Jiang Yan said.

“That’s good. When I fight them later, don’t you come out. Think of a way to leave this place. It’s best if you apply for leave in advance…” Zhou Wen exhorted.

“Don’t worry. I’ll hide far away. What do you want to do? Don’t tell me you really think that you can send shockwaves through the League of Guardians alone?” Jiang Yan asked curiously.

“Why not? I want to turn the League of Guardians upside down and smash that so-called Immortal’s lair singlehandedly,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.
