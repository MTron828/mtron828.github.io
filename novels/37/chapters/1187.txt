Chapter 1188: Leaving Names

Translator: CKtalon

“Do humans really have past lives?” Zhou Wen frowned inwardly. He didn’t believe in reincarnation.

Zhou Wen had always felt that it didn’t matter if someone died. There wouldn’t be anything like a previous life or next life.

“We’ll know once we give it a try.” Li Xuan was intrigued. He ran to the Three-Lives Stone and made an attempt, but like An Jingyu and company, he failed to leave a mark on it.

“It’s indeed a lie. How can I not have a previous life? I must have been an emperor in my previous life with a huge harem,” Li Xuan muttered hatefully.

An Tianzuo also got the remaining officers to give it a try, but just like An Jingyu, none of them could leave a mark on the Three-Lives Stone.

Everyone felt that it was very likely that they had been fooled by the white-haired granny. However, when it was An Sheng’s turn, his finger sank in upon gently touching it. This was different from the previous attempts in which the Three-Lives Stone was extremely hard and undamageable by any weapon. It was now like sand.

An Sheng was slightly taken aback before he casually wrote down his name.

After An Sheng finished writing his name, his finger left the Three-Lives Stone. The name on it flashed with golden light before disappearing.

“Does this count as a success?” Everyone looked at the Three-Lives Stone and An Sheng in surprise.

An Tianzuo also went up to give it a try, but like the other officers, he failed to leave any marks on the Three-Lives Stone.

“That doesn’t make sense. Isn’t it said that all creatures can be reincarnated? Why is Adjutant An the only one with a past and present life, while we don’t? We aren’t any less real than Adjutant An. Why is he the only one with a past and present life?” Lu Bushun grumbled.

“It doesn’t matter if he has a past or present life. What matters is how we cross the Bridge of Helplessness. Only Adjutant An can leave his name on the Three-Lives Stone. We can’t just let him go alone, right?” An Jingyu said.

An Tianzuo frowned at the thought. Clearly, he couldn’t accept such an outcome.

“Young Master Wen, do you want to give it a try too?” Lu Bushun asked Zhou Wen.

Lu Bushun was eager to know if Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign or if he just had a similar Companion Beast.

The others also looked at Zhou Wen, wondering if he could leave his name on the Three-Lives Stone.

Although reincarnation was said to be ethereal and unreal, many people still hoped that there would be a next life. It could be considered a form of spiritual sustenance.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and walked towards the Three-Lives Stone with Ya’er in his arms. He also wanted to know if he could leave his name on the Three-Lives Stone like An Sheng.

Zhou Wen extended his finger and pressed it on the Three-Lives Stone. Everyone’s eyes were drawn by his finger.

However, when Zhou Wen pressed his finger on it, the Three-Lives Stone didn’t react at all. Clearly, he didn’t have a past life.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to retreat, Ya’er extended her finger and pressed it on the Three-Lives Stone. However, the hard rock turned extremely soft under Ya’er’s finger. Soon, Ya’er wrote the word “Ya’er” on the Three-Lives Stone.

Could it be that reincarnation really exists in this world? Zhou Wen felt odd when he saw this.

Ya’er was half-human and half-ghost, but when she first born, it was said that she was the reincarnation of a Gu God.

Now, she had managed to engrave her name on the Three-Lives Stone. This made one’s imagination run wild. Why was she able to engrave her name? Could she really be the reincarnation of a Gu God?

In the end, only An Sheng and Ya’er left their names on the Three-Lives Stone, but it was impossible for them to cross the bridge to save Ouyang Lan. Everyone was somewhat vexed.

Despite knowing that Ouyang Lan and company might be ahead, they couldn’t walk forward no matter what.

“From the looks of it, the only way is to storm through by force.” Lu Bushun rubbed his fists in eagerness.

Everyone returned to the white-haired granny. Zhou Wen knew that it was impossible to barge in. He looked at her and asked, “Apart from leaving our name on the Three-Lives Stone, is there no other way to cross the Bridge of Helplessness without losing our memories?”

“No,” the white-haired granny answered firmly.

Everyone fell silent as Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before suddenly turning around and walking towards the Three-Lives Stone.

Even the antelope didn’t dare offend the white-haired granny; therefore, it was almost impossible for them to barge through. They might as well think of a solution regarding the Three-Lives Stone.

Previously, Zhou Wen had only casually pressed down, so it was understandable that he hadn’t left any traces.

Now that he was at the end of his tether and he was bent on crossing the Bridge of Helplessness, he could only turn his sights back to the Three-Lives Stone again.

As he circulated Terror-grade power, he struck the Three-Lives Stone, but the outcome was the same. Even Terror-grade power couldn’t deal damage to the Three-Lives Stone.

Zhou Wen switched to several different Terror powers and used all of them, but none of them worked.

Demon God Body, Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Clown Mask, Singularity Universe, and Great Brahma’s powers were useless.

How can I satisfy this condition of having a past and present life? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.

Lu Bushun and company were somewhat alarmed when they saw that Zhou Wen was still unable to leave a mark on the Three-Lives Stone despite all his efforts.

If even Zhou Wen couldn’t do it, there was probably no hope.

I don’t believe it. Can’t I leave a mark on it? Zhou Wen began carving Sword Pill on his Wheel of Destiny.

Soon, a sword pill appeared in Zhou Wen’s palm. He reached out to grab it, and it immediately transformed into a sword.

Clang!

Zhou Wen held the sword transformed from Sword Pill and slashed at the Three-Lives Stone, but things remained the same.

However, Zhou Wen had no intention of stopping. He continued slashing at the Three-Lives Stone again and again. He seemed to treat the Three-Lives Stone as a blade tester as he constantly slashed at it.

However, no matter how terrifying Zhou Wen’s strike was, it couldn’t leave a mark on the Three-Lives Stone. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Indeed, it’s just a Companion Beast of the same species. From the looks of it, Young Master Wen isn’t Human Sovereign. Seeing that Zhou Wen hadn’t even cracked the Three-Lives Stone’s surface after slashing at it for so long, Lu Bushun began to doubt his previous judgment.

Human Sovereign’s slash at Di Tian was an extremely dominating force. Although the force Zhou Wen was dishing out was powerful, it wasn’t as powerful as Human Sovereign’s. Furthermore, the weapon in Zhou Wen’s hand wasn’t the legendary sword.

Unbeknownst to them, the Immortal Culling Sword couldn’t be used casually.

Zhou Wen didn’t care what they thought as he continued slashing at the Three-Lives Stone. At the same time, he engraved the Sword Pill on his Wheel of Destiny again and again.

He gave all his ideas a try. Not only did he push his sword techniques closer to perfection, but he also made Sword Pill begin to change.
