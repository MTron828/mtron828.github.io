Chapter 1314: Thoughts

Zhou Wen looked at Zhang Yuzhi in a daze. Zhang Yuzhi was still Zhang Yuzhi. In his eyes, Zhang Yuzhi was still playing the zither with her eyes closed as she immersed herself in her singing.

However, for some reason, the scene of a little girl curled up in the darkness surfaced in Zhou Wen’s mind. He could even hear her trembling and tragic voice.

“Since the heavens have already destined me to walk into the darkness… I’ll exchange for everyone’s light using the darkness I suffer alone… This is what I deserve… They all treat me as a friend… They would rather die than let me suffer any harm… Yet, I caused their deaths… Such a filthy me… I’m not worthy of embracing the light… Zhang Yuzhi… You deserve death… What’s there to be afraid of?”

The little girl looked up as tears flowed down her face. She looked ahead and in front of her, there was a sliver of light in the darkness.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. The light came from a figure that emitted light like an angel. However, it didn’t have wings or an angel’s halo. It only had the appearance of a human, and its appearance was identical to Zhou Wen’s.

The girl looked at the figure as though she wanted to extend her hand to grab something, but when her hand was halfway out, she slowly retracted it cowardly.

“A person like me… only brings misfortune to friends… only harms them… I don’t deserve to have friends…” The little girl looked at the figure reluctantly and slowly retracted her hand. Finally, she buried her head in her arms and curled up, sobbing softly. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The only figure that brought the sliver of light scattered in the darkness. The world instantly returned to its despairing darkness.

At that moment, Zhang Yuzhi had finished singing. She opened her eyes and the scene of the girl in Zhou Wen’s mind vanished as though everything was just a dream.

The various sounds that had vanished returned to Zhou Wen’s ears, plummeting him into a sea of noise again.

“How’s my singing?” Zhang Yuzhi asked Zhou Wen.

Perhaps it was because the sea of noise had just surged over and hadn’t completely occupied Zhou Wen’s hearing, he heard the sentence clearly.

“I didn’t hear you clearly.” Zhou Wen shook his head.

Strangely enough, he did hear Zhang Yuzhi’s voice. Furthermore, he heard it very clearly and wasn’t affected by the sea of noise. However, he couldn’t remember what she had sung. All he could remember was the scene and voice of the little girl.

“You idiot who doesn’t know how to appreciate art. Just seeing you makes me angry. Go, go, go. Don’t let me see you again.” Zhang Yuzhi looked very upset. With that said, she got up and returned to her building.

“Sorry, we spoiled Yuzhi. She’s a little willful, but she doesn’t have any ill intentions. Don’t blame her,” Zhang Chunqiu said to Zhou Wen.

“I know.” Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that the chances of him accurately capturing sounds had increased significantly.

“I’ll walk you out,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before asking Zhang Chunqiu, “Is the Fiend Tomb really fine?”

“Don’t you think that the weather these two days has been much cooler?” Zhang Chunqiu didn’t answer directly.

Zhou Wen understood what he meant. The scorching hot weather had gradually returned to normal over the past few days. It seemed to indicate that the Fiend Tomb had come under control.

If it were in the past, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have had any negative thoughts. He would have felt that this matter was over. However, when he recalled the scene of the girl he had seen, he felt that something was amiss.

The scene I saw wasn’t an illusion. If I’m not wrong, it should be the ability Truth Listener gave me. Legend has it that Truth Listener can listen to the sounds of the world and hear the good and evil of the human heart. In other words, it has the ability to hear what the heart has to say. What I heard might very well be Zhang Yuzhi’s inner voice…?Zhou Wen guessed.

However, for some reason, Zhou Wen could hear Zhang Yuzhi’s thoughts a moment ago, but he couldn’t hear anything now. He tried, but he couldn’t hear Zhang Chunqiu and the others’ thoughts. It made Zhou Wen suspect that his judgment was right. Perhaps it was really an illusion.

“My hearing hasn’t completely recovered. Can you let me rest here for two more days? I’ll leave after I recover.” Zhou Wen asked Zhang Chunqiu.

“I do wish for you to stay a few more days, but Yuzhi said that she doesn’t want to see you. When she sees you again, she will definitely lose her temper,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“What did you say?” Zhou Wen didn’t hear Zhang Chunqiu.

“I do wish for you to stay a few more days…” Zhang Chunqiu had no choice but to repeat himself.

However, just as he said that, Zhou Wen said, “I can’t stay for too long. I still have something to do when I return. A few days really won’t do. I’ll stay for another two days.”

“No, I’m saying that Yuzhi doesn’t want to see you. If she sees that you haven’t left, she will lose her temper again…” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“What? You will lose your temper? I really have something on. I can’t stay for too long. I can only stay for three days at most, not any longer…” As Zhou Wen spoke, he pulled Zhang Chunqiu out. As he walked, he said,” I never expected you to be so hospitable. If I had known this would happen, I would have come to you often in the past… You’re really too nice…”

Zhang Chunqiu looked at Zhou Wen, unsure if he really couldn’t hear him.

“What’s going on? Why hasn’t Zhou Wen left?” Zhang Xiao asked after Zhang Chunqiu and Zhou Wen separated.

“His hearing hasn’t recovered yet. He wants to stay another two to three more days,” Zhang Chunqiu answered.

“How can we have that? The day after tomorrow is…” Zhang Xiao stopped talking.

“It’s fine. Just ignore him,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“What the uncles mean is that they are afraid that Zhou Wen will hinder our matters. If anything happens, the Zhang family will never have peace. It’s best to let him leave early,” Zhang Xiao said.

“I don’t have the ability to chase him away, nor do I think he will hinder us. If you think there’s something wrong with him, chase him away yourself,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he turned around and left.

Zhang Xiao looked at Zhou Wen’s yard, but he didn’t dare really head over. All he could do was return and tell his elders Zhang Chunqiu’s words.

The Zhang family’s elders were also worried. If it were an ordinary person, the Zhang family could chase them away, but the person living in the Zhang family residence was Zhou Wen.

The Zhang family knew Zhou Wen’s strength. If Zhou Wen didn’t leave, they wouldn’t dare use force to chase him out.

When the Eldest Uncle Zhang got Zhang Xiao to chase Zhou Wen away, Zhang Xiao hesitated for a moment before saying, “Uncle, I think Zhou Wen really just wants to recover his hearing before leaving. It probably has nothing to do with our Zhang family.”

Even Zhang Chunqiu couldn’t chase Zhou Wen away. What could he do?

“Forget it. He’s not a hindrance. Let him stay there.” In the end, it was Zhang Siyou who spoke. This matter was left unsettled.
