Chapter 1508 Super AI

Zhou Wen could roughly guess Hui Haifeng’s thoughts, but this matter gave him a headache.

It was impossible to gather the nine Life Providences and nine Life Souls and advance to the Mythical stage as a pure human. At the very least, Zhou Wen hadn’t discovered any other method other than the Lost Immortal Sutra.

The only path left was Spirit Casting, Mythical Serum, and Guardian contracting.

In the past, Spirit Casting and Mythical Serum were indeed good choices. Hui Haifeng was also an expert in producing Mythical Serums. It wasn’t difficult to create a Mythical Serum that was suitable for Hui Wan to raise his success rate.

However, Hui Haifeng didn’t do it. Instead, he handed Hui Wan over to Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen roughly guessed that Hui Haifeng wasn’t completely confident of success. Hui Haifeng didn’t wish to take it even if there was only a 1% risk.

This wasn’t the crux of the problem. The crux was that Zhou Wen had heard from the humanoid monster in Ancient Sovereign City that it was best if humans could ensure the purity of their bloodline.

If the premise was to ensure the purity of the bloodline, contracting a Guardian was a more suitable path.

Therefore, after some thought, Zhou Wen felt somewhat stumped.

“Master, I’ve tried many times and used a large number of high-level Essence Energy Crystals, but I just can’t advance to the Mythical stage. Did I do something wrong?” Hui Wan came in front of Zhou Wen and took out his notebook. As he asked Zhou Wen, he recorded his teachings.

Zhou Wen thought to himself, It would be a surprise if you could advance to the Mythical stage. In ancient times, this was called the limits of the Deva Realm. Since ancient times, there haven’t been many humans who could break through the limits of the Deva Realm with their pure human bodies. As far as Zhou Wen knew, even Human Sovereigns like Suirenshi couldn’t do it. Among the people Zhou Wen knew, other than himself, only Jing Daoxian had that possibility, but it was impossible to confirm that he advanced to the Mythical stage with a pure human bloodline.

“Show me your Life Providence and Life Soul,” Zhou Wen said, unwilling to dampen Hui Wan’s enthusiasm.

Hui Wan put away the notebook and stood up. He circulated the Qi Refinement Art and quickly condensed his Qi, turning it into a Life Soul that floated in front of him.

“What’s this?” Zhou Wen sized up Hui Wan’s Life Soul and found it odd.

When Zhou Wen cultivated the Qi Refinement Art, the Life Soul he condensed was Sword Pill. The Life Soul Hui Wan condensed was completely different from his. Not only was it not Sword Pill, but it wasn’t a blade or saber. It looked like a phone no matter how he looked at it.

“Your Life Soul is a cell phone?” Zhou Wen sized up the Life Soul and asked.

“It’s not a phone. You can call it a Super AI.” Hui Wan explained the detailed abilities of his Life Soul.

The more Zhou Wen listened, the more he found it odd. Hui Wan said that it wasn’t a phone, but many of the functions of this Life Soul were similar to a phone. Hui Wan could even connect to the Federation’s Internet through his Life Soul.

What was even more terrifying was that this thing could also quickly crack all kinds of passwords. Opening an electronic lock was very simple. The bank vaults that used high-tech protective equipment were no different from naked beauties in front of Hui Wan’s Life Soul.

Of course, this wasn’t the only effect of the Super AI Life Soul. There were many other uses, but they had nothing to do with combat.

“Your Life Soul is somewhat special. Can you enter the Zhang family’s server to search for information with this Life Soul?” Zhou Wen asked Hui Wan.

Currently, the server controlled by the Zhang family had the highest encryption and defense in the Federation. No one had been able to hack into it to search for information.

“Of course. I’ve accessed it a few times before, but there wasn’t much interesting content inside. I only found a few pill formulas and spirit talisman creation methods. There wasn’t much else of value,” Hui Wan said to Zhou Wen as he skillfully got the Super AI Life Soul to connect to the Internet.

Before Zhou Wen could say a word, he saw plenty of data appear on the Super Al’s screen. Clearly, it had succeeded. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“You’ve done this a lot in the past, right? Have you seen the private servers of the other families?” Zhou Wen knew that Hui Wan had done this quite a number of times when he saw how adept he was.

“I’ve taken a look, but there aren’t many interesting things. The various families have the intention of keeping important information in equipment without network access. Most of the information I can find is useless,” Hui Wan said casually.

Zhou Wen thought to himself, You sure are gutsy. It’s no wonder the Hui family has been doing so well recently. Although Hui Haifeng doesn’t have much power in the Federation, he has been advancing step by step. He has been doing well and hasn’t made any major decision mistakes. I reckon some of this is thanks to Hui Wan.

“This is the first time I’ve seen a Life Soul like yours. I need to consider it before giving you some suggestions. Before that, you should learn more combat techniques,” Zhou Wen said half-truthfully.

“I’m already very familiar with my combat techniques…” Hui Wan said confidently.

“Actual combat techniques aren’t something that can be mastered with practice. Actual combat naturally needs to be honed through actual combat. How about this? Go to your Uncle Li Xuan and get him to arrange for you to participate in the defense. You can continue training on the battlefield.”

When Hui Wan heard that he could enter the battlefield, his eyes lit up. “Can it really be done? Dad has always refused to let me participate in real battles. He only wants me to fight those dimensional creatures at home. It’s so boring.”

“Of course. I call the shots here. It’s useless even if your father comes,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Long live Master! I can finally go on the battlefield!” Hui Wan immediately became excited. At that moment, he looked like a child.

After sending Hui Wan to Li Xuan, Zhou Wen was still worried. He deliberately gave Li Xuan a call to ensure Hui Wan’s safety. This was Hui Haifeng’s only heir. He couldn’t die here.

After hanging up, Zhou Wen picked up the mysterious phone and realized that the dungeon hadn’t been downloaded successfully. It was still the download screen.

Strange, why is this dungeon so huge? Could it be that the dungeon I downloaded this time isn’t a single Alcor, but a dimensional zone of the entire Big Dipper? Otherwise, it wouldn’t have taken so long to download a single dungeon. Zhou Wen was very suspicious.

While Zhou Wen was studying it, he received a message from Li Xuan saying that something had happened in the Dubhe instance dungeon.

Zhou Wen hurriedly launched the livestream app on his phone. On the homepage, there were many streamers livestreaming the Cube. He clicked on one and indeed, he discovered a problem.

Previously, the scene of the Cube had been fixed on Dubhe that constantly emitted flames. However, at that moment, the scene of the Cube seemed to rapidly sink into Dubhe’s extremely hot celestial body.

Soon, the scene was completely filled with dazzling bursts of light. However, not long after, the scene suddenly darkened, and a strange palace appeared on the Cube’s screen.
