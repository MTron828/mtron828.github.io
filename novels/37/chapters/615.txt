Chapter 616 Let Out Some Blood

After the Xuanwen Club’s event ended, Zhou Wen returned to his dorm and sent a message to The Thearch. He informed her that the items were ready for her to receive.

"Send them over." The Thearch replied.

Zhou Wen sent the items through the portal through the Void Flower. Although they weren’t worth much, he had still spent more than 100,000. It made his heart ache slightly.

"The Thearch, you previously said that only the first Companion Beast on the rankings has benefits. Then, what other benefits does first place have in the future?" Zhou Wen probed.

"Why are you asking? Your Companion Beast isn’t capable of ranking first. It’s useless even if you know," The Thearch replied.

"Even if I can’t obtain first place, I can still try my best to vie for a higher ranking. Will the other rankings benefit me?" Zhou Wen could tell from The Thearch’s tone that it might really be as Sadie had said.

"Yes, but if you can’t enter the top ten, the benefits are very limited. Your Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s Wheel of Destiny is virtually useless in the pet battle. From the looks of the Companion Beasts on the rankings, it’s not bad if it can eventually reach the top thirty. The one on your ear isn’t even at the Mythical stage. It’s impossible for it to enter the top hundred."

Can’t I have other Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen said that inwardly without sending it to The Thearch. He didn’t wish to expose his true strength in front of The Thearch.

"The Thearch, what benefits will there be for getting on the rankings?" Zhou Wen asked again.

"Do you want to know?" The Thearch’s message came quickly. Unfortunately, it wasn’t an answer.

"Yes," Zhou Wen answered.

"All the more reason why I won’t tell you." The Thearch even sent a smug expression after the message. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Helpless, Zhou Wen had no choice but to remain silent.

However, he was certain that there was definitely some benefit to being able to enter the rankings. However, if the ranking was too low, the benefits wouldn’t be great.

Just as The Thearch said, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon isn’t suitable for a one-on-one battle. Its ranking definitely won’t be high. Which Companion Beast should I use to give it a try? Zhou Wen was momentarily hesitant.

To get on the rankings, one definitely needed to fight. In a battle, one would expose the strength of their Companion Beasts, giving others a chance to figure out a way to restrain them.

Zhou Wen was now thinking about which Companion Beast to expose, one that wouldn’t affect him much in the future.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to make a decision. There was still plenty of time, so he didn’t need to hurry. Furthermore, the rules of the rankings were that one could only challenge high-ranking ones, not the other way round. Zhou Wen didn’t plan on challenging Primordial Sword Immortal from the beginning.

I have to ask An Sheng first if the Companion Beasts from the Special Inspector Bureau and Cape family are on the rankings. I’ll start with them. Zhou Wen planned on catching them by surprise. He planned on killing their Companion Beasts on the rankings before personally settling scores with them.

Zhou Wen sent a message to An Sheng, but An Sheng didn’t reply. He did not know what he was busy with.

Forget it. I’ll give it a try and see if I can use Grim Demon’s blood to advance the First Order of Chaos. Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate out.

"Little Neonate, get Grim Demon out. I need him to do something," Zhou Wen said to Demonic Neonate.

Demonic Neonate remained silent as she summoned Grim Demon from the ancient sword.

After Grim Demon came out, his entire body was like a black demonic aura. He had an anthropomorphic look, but his looks were indiscernible.

Clang!

Zhou Wen placed a washbasin in front of Grim Demon and said, "I need some of your blood. I don’t need too much. Just half a basin would do."

Grim Demon’s expression instantly darkened. Thankfully, his body was covered in the black demonic aura, so no expression could be seen.

"No way." Grim Demon gritted his teeth.

"Little Neonate." Zhou Wen looked at Demonic Neonate.

Demonic Neonate turned to look at Grim Demon and glared at him.

Grim Demon immediately cowered. He gritted his teeth and said to Zhou Wen, "Our Guardian’s blood is our life essence. It’s impossible for me to give you that much. At most, I can only give you one drop."

"One hundred drops." Zhou Wen bargained.

"Two drops. It really can’t be more." Grim Demon’s voice was trembling as though he was trying his best to suppress the anger in his heart.

"Ninety-nine drops. Not any less," Zhou Wen said without changing his expression.

After a final round of negotiation, Grim Demon refused to add any more beyond five drops. No matter how threatening Zhou Wen was, it was useless.

"Five drops? So be it then. Produce it." Zhou Wen felt that Grim Demon was already desperate enough to risk his life in defiance, so he didn’t continue forcing him. If it was really useful, one drop would be enough. Five drops would be more than enough.

Grim Demon reluctantly extended his finger. Five drops of black liquid that resembled ink flew out and floated in front of Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen reached out and had the five drops of Grim Demon’s blood float over his hand. Then, he said to Demonic Neonate, "Alright, store him away."

Demonic Neonate extended the ancient sword in her arms. Grim Demon could only obediently possess the ancient sword.

"Good girl. Go play with Banana Fairy." Zhou Wen patted Demonic Neonate’s head and carried the five drops of Grim Demon’s blood into the training room.

He circulated the First Order of Chaos in an attempt to absorb the five drops of Grim Demon’s blood, but the First Order of Chaos seemed to reject it. He failed to absorb it.

Can’t I absorb it? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. This proved that their stats were incompatible. Even if he could barely absorb the five drops of Grim Demon’s blood, it wouldn’t be of much use.

Don’t tell me that I really need the blood of the Guardian in Ant City? Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at the five drops of Grim Demon’s blood.

He felt that the five drops of blood couldn’t be wasted. Zhou Wen switched to the other Essence Energy Arts, hoping to see if he could fuse them with Grim Demon’s blood.

In the end, even though there were strong and weak rejections, they were all incompatible.

Just as Zhou Wen was feeling depressed, he suddenly felt a burning sensation in his ears.

Could it be that Truth Listener is about to hatch? Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener and saw that it was still in its Companion Egg form and hadn’t hatched.

However, the moment Truth Listener came out, the five drops of Grim Demon blood were sucked away by it. The five drops of blood fused into the golden crystal-like Companion Egg, dyeing the flawless golden color with five black impurities.

Isn’t Truth Listener a Buddhist divine beast? Why does it need demonic blood? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he looked at the Companion Egg that had absorbed the demonic blood.

After Truth Listener’s Companion Egg absorbed the demonic blood, the demonic blood’s black colors gradually spread inside the Companion Egg. It was as though a jar of water had been thrown into the ink. The ink gradually spread out in the clear water and quickly dyed the entire Companion Egg black.
