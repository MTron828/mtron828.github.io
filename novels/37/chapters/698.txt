Chapter 699: Strange Treasure Chest

Translator: CKtalon

“Are you kidding me? Don’t tell me that it will be an empty box in the end?” Zhou Wen said gloomily.

An Sheng laughed. “As expected of Young Master Wen. The Overseer and I opened six treasure chests, but none of them were as interesting as a single one of yours.”

“This really has nothing to do with me. You were the ones who picked the good treasure chests. The remaining treasure chests are all so strange,” Zhou Wen said gloomily.

“Quickly open it and take a look. I’m really looking forward to seeing what’s inside,” An Sheng urged.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue opening the treasure chests. One after another, he opened at least twenty. The treasure chest also changed from a huge chest to a tiny chest the size of a palm.

Zhou Wen tried and wanted to take out the treasure chest, but although it was tiny, it remained motionless no matter how hard he tried.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue opening them chest after chest The treasure chest had already become the size of a finger. Yet, there was still a treasure chest inside.

“I’m very certain now that the owner of the maze must be pulling a prank on us. There’s definitely nothing in the final treasure chest.” Zhou Wen felt that he had definitely been fooled.

“At this stage, even if it’s empty, you have to open the last box to take a look,” An Sheng encouraged.

Zhou Wen continued opening the chest silently. The treasure chest went from the size of a finger to the size of a fingernail.

“F**k, why are there more? I can’t believe it.” Zhou Wen continued opening a few more chests. The treasure chest was already about the size of the jewel on a ring.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to open it, he realized that the square stone treasure chest that resembled a ring’s gem was locked. Although the lock was very small, he could tell that it was a lock.

“Isn’t this a scam? I’ve opened all the way to this point, yet, it’s telling me that it needs a key...” Zhou Wen wished he could smash the treasure chest.

However, it was unknown if the treasure chests were protected by nomological powers. Even Mythical-stage power was unable to damage them.

“Could this small treasure chest be the prize in this treasure chest?” An Sheng said as he looked at the small treasure chest.

“No way?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he reached out to pick up the tiny treasure chest. He had opened so many treasure chests and of them could be moved. Yet, this time, he could pick it up.

“I can actually take it out!” Zhou Wen immediately realized that the fellow who had placed the treasure chest here was definitely doing it on purpose.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and didn’t find a way to open the treasure chest. He handed it to An Sheng to take a look. After studying it, An Sheng returned it to Zhou Wen. “The structure inside the keyhole is somewhat different from our human locks. It might require a special key to open it. Young Master Wen, put it away now. Think of a way to open it after we are out.”

Zhou Wen had no choice but to put away the mini treasure chest. With such a small treasure chest, there was probably nothing inside. Even if there was something, what could be inside?

He had opened two treasure chests which only contained strange items. Zhou Wen was beginning to miss Wang Lu. If he could get her to help him open the treasure chests, he definitely wouldn’t be so unlucky to have such strange items.

The two of them set off again. Due to their previous experience, An Sheng was afraid that this small treasure chest would trigger a change in the maze, so he walked even more carefully.

However, nothing unexpected happened. Just like before, as long as they waited for the hourglass’s safe period, they could successfully pass through the stone rooms.

Finally, Zhou Wen and An Sheng arrived at the location of the third treasure chest. Zhou Wen stood in front of it and pressed his palms together. He prayed in every direction. “Gods from every denomination, please bless me. I don’t wish to become rich overnight. I just want something normal to come out. Mythical Companion Beasts or something, just one will do. I’m really not picky...”

While praying, Zhou Wen summoned the baby tiger, hoping to increase his luck. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

An Sheng held back his laughter when he heard Zhou Wen mutter to himself. He said in all seriousness, “Young Master, it’s all determined by fate. Open it quickly.”

Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and opened the lid.

“It’s indeed very normal...” An Sheng looked into the box and immediately laughed. This was because the box was empty. There was nothing inside.

“That’s it?” Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.

“Why don’t I take you to find another box? What if you’re born different and can open a fourth box?” An Sheng said.

“Don’t trouble yourself. Let’s return,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.

He decided that he would never open any cursed chests or other items that depended on luck again unless he could come with Wang Lu.

An Sheng led Zhou Wen out. It was impossible to return the way they came. As the stone room’s location kept changing, he could only find a new path.

Thankfully, nothing happened on the way back. The two of them successfully exited the maze.

An Sheng used the metal plate to seal the well’s entrance again. He covered it with soil as a disguise. Unless it was a coincidence, it would be difficult to discover the entrance to the maze.

Zhou Wen realized that the crystal hourglass in his hand had appeared to freeze. The sand inside which should still be flowing was frozen. It looked like time had stopped. It was extremely magical.

“Young Master Wen, it’s not as though you didn’t gain anything. Even if the small treasure chest is empty, this crystal hourglass is rather magical. It might really be a treasure,” An Sheng consoled.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to say anything. He put away the crystal hourglass and the mini treasure chest and planned on thinking of a way to open it when he returned.

The two of them returned to Luoyang, but they realized that there were very few people on the city streets. Soon, they realized that most people were watching a livestream.

“Someone actually challenged Primordial Sword Immortal again. It’s no wonder so many people are watching the livestream.” Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to search and discovered the problem.

“That’s not surprising. There aren’t many days left for the three-month deadline. There must be someone who can’t hold back. Let’s see who’s challenging Primordial Sword Immortal,” An Sheng said as he took out his phone and turned on the livestream. He ended up somewhat surprised.

In the arena, Primordial Sword Immortal had already revealed his sword immortal body. He stood in the arena with the stone sword in hand, but there was no sign of a challenger.

Suddenly, the sword immortal’s head seemed to suffer a heavy blow as his body flew out horizontally.

“What was that?” Zhou Wen and An Sheng failed to see what had happened.
