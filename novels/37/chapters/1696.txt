Chapter 1697: Hidden Star Palace

Zhou Wen arrived in front of the long stairs. He naturally wouldn’t unsummon Truth Listener. It would only be more troublesome to summon it again.

Furthermore, Truth Listener wasn’t afraid of these strange taboos at all. It was even better than his Teacher Domain. He didn’t need to do anything; the ability to drain Essence Energy along the long flight of stairs was useless against him.

Everyone immediately became excited when they saw Human Sovereign take Truth Listener up the long flight of stairs without any intention of unsummoning it.

“Sect Master Gu’s mouth is indeed blessed. From the looks of it, Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast isn’t afraid of the Essence Energy draining ability along the stairs.”

“It’s not just the Companion Beast that isn’t afraid. Human Sovereign definitely isn’t afraid either. This is quite impressive.”

As expected, Human Sovereign easily led Truth Listener to the end of the long flight of stairs and pushed open the door to Alkaid Star Palace.

“Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast is just so cool. It’s practically domineering. All kinds of powers are useless against it. What kind of Companion Beast is this? I’ve never heard of such a Companion Beast,” Su Yi said excitedly.

Professor Gu was a little embarrassed, so he stopped talking. He didn’t know what was wrong with him today; no matter how he analyzed it, it was wrong. Professor Gu thought to himself,?It’s best if I don’t talk too much. This Human Sovereign really doesn’t play by the rules.

Zhou Wen pushed open the Star Palace’s door and walked in with Truth Listener who delivered another explosive punch. This was under the condition that Zhou Wen got Truth Listener to hold back. Otherwise, even the Star Palace would probably be wrecked.

“Holy sh*t, that works? Karoman fought for a few minutes, but it just takes a punch to finish him off?”

“This Companion Beast is nuts!”

“There’s no need for strategy or plan. Just blow it up with one punch.”

“Human Sovereign’s the best. Even Sect Master Gu can’t jinx him. He was so steady, clearing the seven Star Palaces so casually.”

“No matter how I look at it, this Companion Beast is stronger than Karoman. Although he relied on a Companion Beast to clear the levels, it’s too amazing. It should have a chance of vying for first place on the rankings, right?”

“Can I ask where I can get such a Companion Beast?”

“Stop dreaming. Ignoring the fact that such a Companion Beast is definitely unique, even if there’s a place to obtain it, you don’t have the ability to obtain it.”

Everyone was awestruck. Truth Listener’s domineering style left them wanting for more.

“Professor Gu, do you think Human Sovereign has a chance of getting first place?” Su Yi asked Professor Gu.

Professor Gu cleared his throat and said conservatively, “In theory, the score obtained from using a Companion Beast to clear the level is lower than clearing it individually. The more Companion Beasts used, the lower the score. However, Human Sovereign only used one Companion Beast. Furthermore, he cleared the level in a steamrolling manner. His score shouldn’t be low, so he has a chance of vying for first place.”

As he spoke, Professor Gu couldn’t hold it in any longer. He continued, “However, Human Sovereign has already seen the abilities of all the Starlords. The difficulty of clearing the level definitely can’t compare to Karoman, who cleared the Star Palace on his first attempt. If Human Sovereign was the first person to clear the seven Star Palaces, he would definitely be first on the rankings. Now, there’s still some suspense.”

The meaning behind Professor Gu’s words was that although Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast was very strong, he had benefited from Karoman and hadn’t cleared the unknown Star Palace himself.

“That’s not right. After all, it’s only a matter of one punch. Even if he hadn’t seen Karoman clear the level, Human Sovereign can clear it as he pleases. I bet that Human Sovereign will definitely be at the top of the rankings.”

“It’s indeed a pity. If only Human Sovereign had come out earlier.”

Just as people were discussing if Human Sovereign could reach the top of the rankings, they saw him arrive in front of a mini star in the Star Palace. Truth Listener reached out to push the mini star, causing it to spin.

“What’s he doing?” It wasn’t just the average person. Even the people from the various factions were puzzled. They didn’t know why Human Sovereign wasn’t leaving after clearing the level.

Junior Brother, what are you trying to do??Hui Haifeng was already very satisfied with Zhou Wen’s performance. Although he hadn’t taken action himself, it was already very commendable for him to use a Companion Beast to surpass Karoman’s limelight.

Amidst everyone’s puzzlement, the mini star emitted a blue light that transformed into a blue beam that shone on the teleportation nexus, dyeing it ice-blue.

“Holy sh*t, what’s Human Sovereign doing?”

“What’s going on?”

“No way. Could there be something fishy with the Big Dipper Palaces?”

Many people widened their eyes as they watched the magical changes in the Star Palace.

When Zhou Wen walked into the teleportation nexus with Truth Listener, the scene on the Cube changed to the North Star and the ice palace.

“Heavens, there’s actually another Star Palace?”

“Holy sh*t, there’s a hidden Star Palace?”

“How did Human Sovereign know?”

Instantly, the Internet was filled with surprised comments as a series of question marks flooded the screen.

Professor Gu was dumbfounded. He had just said that Human Sovereign hadn’t cleared an unknown Star Palace himself, but it ended up with him activating an unknown Star Palace.

Now, Professor Gu wished he could slap himself twice. He regretted saying that last sentence.

“This Starlord looks so cool. What Starlord is this?”

“Lad, you don’t usually read, right? It’s obvious that you aren’t cultured. The star corresponding to the Big Dipper is definitely the North Star. And the North Star has the name of the Purple Star Palace. I guess this Star Palace should be the Purple Star Palace. Lord Human Sovereign is indeed a genius who knows everything about astronomy and geology. He must have used Purple Star Astrology to figure out the hidden Star Palace. I’m getting more impressed with him.”

“This is the true sovereign of humanity. There’s no need for him to enter the Star Palaces personally. He can deduce the hidden Star Palace with just a snap of his fingers. A cultured person is just that confident.”

Many people were about to turn Human Sovereign into a myth. Unbeknown to them, Zhou Wen knew nothing about Purple Star Astrology.

“Human Sovereign actually knows Purple Star Astrology?” Zhang Chunqiu wore a look of shock.

Purple Star Astrology was also known as the number one form of divination, a field meant to serve an emperor. The Zhang family also studied Purple Star Astrology, but there weren’t many people who were truly proficient in it. Yet, Human Sovereign actually knew it and seemed to be very proficient in it. This left him somewhat surprised.

It was impossible to deduce the existence of the hidden Star Palace from the layout of the miniature stars in the Star Palace and find the star that could open a hidden dimensional zone among the countless miniature stars if one didn’t know Purple Star Astrology.

“What does this fellow not know?” Xia Liuchuan’s face was filled with envy and jealousy.

In the Wang family, Wang Lu wore a look of worry as she prayed silently.?I hope nothing happens.

Compared to others’ curiosity about the hidden Star Palace, Wang Lu was more worried about Zhou Wen’s safety. She had long known that Human Sovereign was Zhou Wen. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“The dangers of the hidden Star Palace are unknown. Young Master Wen is too rash.” An Sheng also wore a look of worry.

An Tianzuo didn’t say a word, but his eyes were also filled with worry.
