Chapter 1147: Five Years in the Federation

“Um... Excuse me... Professor Ming... Is he your colleague?” a female classmate asked hopefully.

“No, he’s my coach,” Ming Xiu answered.

As he didn’t know if Zhou Wen would expose his identity, he didn’t mention his name.

“Coach?” Many scenes surfaced in the girls’ minds.

Time: night; location: training room; characters: Professor Ming and male coach.

Professor Ming, who was only in sports attire, took off his top because it was too hot, revealing his sweaty, firm chest.

The shameless male coach leaned against Ming Xiu from behind with one hand on his waist and the other hand holding Ming Xiu’s sword. He even pretended to correct Ming Xiu’s actions, but...

It’s not like that... It’s definitely not like that... The girl from before didn’t believe that Ming Xiu was such a person. She anxiously asked, “Professor Ming, your relationship with him isn’t what we are thinking, right?”

Ming Xiu imagined that they didn’t believe that Zhou Wen was his coach, so he said, “It’s exactly it. Tomorrow Sword Art was named by Coach. Without Coach, there’s no Tomorrow Sword Art.”

Tomorrow Sword Art is actually a love memento! The girls felt as though they had been struck by lightning as they felt their beliefs crumble instantly.

Ming Xiu clearly wasn’t in the mood to talk to them. He pulled Zhou Wen and said, “Coach, this isn’t a place to talk. Let’s find a place with no one around to have a good chat...”

No one around... Have a chat... The girls were petrified as an indescribable scene surfaced in their minds.

Zhou Wen followed Ming Xiu out of the flower garden. Tsukuyomi silently followed behind them without doing anything out of line.

Ming Xiu found a private lounge and used a Companion Beast with sound-proofing abilities. He looked at Tsukuyomi and saw Zhou Wen nod slightly. Only then did he chat with Zhou Wen and tell him about what had happened in the Federation over the past few years.

In the past five years, the dimension hadn’t activated the cube rankings again, nor had it chosen a new King of Earth.

However, there were already quite a number of Guardians on Earth and they had established the League of Guardians. Many Senators were members of the League of Guardians.

Therefore, many Federation resolutions were influenced by the League of Guardians.

The previous president had died for some baffling reason. Many people suspected that it had something to do with the League of Guardians because the previous president was a member of the anti-Guardian faction.

Now, President Hui Haifeng didn’t openly oppose Guardians, but he had been secretly working hard, hoping to escape the League of Guardians’s influence on the Federation and the Senate.

However, from the looks of it, the efforts were fruitless.

Although Hui Haifeng had developed the Mythical Serum, it was very difficult to rely on it to advance to the Mythical stage. It was even more difficult to advance to the Terror grade using it.

The Federation was actually still controlled by the League of Guardians. There was no lack of powerful Terror-grade Guardians in the League of Guardians. In five years, many Guardians had grown stronger.

“You used the Mythical Serum?” Zhou Wen looked at Ming Xiu and saw that the body under his clothes was in a strange crystalline state, like jade.

Ming Xiu nodded slightly. “I’d rather become a monster than bow to those Guardians.”

“What about Qiuyan?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“He also used the Mythical Serum. He’s stronger than me,” Ming Xiu answered.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what to say. Although he knew that humans had the possibility of advancing to the Mythical stage, that path was too difficult. Apart from himself, Xia Jiuhuang was the only other person Zhou Wen knew that had taken this path.

However, it was difficult to say if Xia Jiuhuang had truly succeeded. After all, he had ultimately borrowed the power of the Guardian in the log. It was impossible to determine if he had advanced to the Mythical stage independently.

“Who’s in charge of the League of Guardians now?” Zhou Wen asked. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“There are four Guardian Heavenly Kings in the League of Guardians. They are Blood Shaman, Cave Era, Hermit, and Great Skyfiend. They are all Terror-grade existences, but they aren’t the true leaders of the League of Guardians. Up to now, no one has seen his true face. All we know is that the Guardians of the League of Guardians call him Immortal,” Ming Xiu said.

After a pause, Ming Xiu continued, “Apart from the League of Guardians, there’s also an organization that specializes in hunting Guardians. It’s called the Holy Spirit Association. The entire organization is very mysterious and it’s very difficult to find any traces of them. The president of the Holy Spirit Association is Ya, who previously occupied first place on the cube.”

“From your tone, you seem to be very displeased with the Holy Spirit Association. It doesn’t seem to be a problem for them to hunt Guardians, right?” Zhou Wen asked.

Ming Xiu sighed and said, “It’s fine if it’s just hunting Guardians, but they don’t differentiate between good and bad. They don’t care if the humans who contract with Guardians are good or bad either. They kill them all. They don’t even spare the humans who contract with Guardians. I really can’t agree with their actions. What’s the difference between such indiscriminate killing and those devils?”

Zhou Wen shook his head and didn’t say anything else. With Zhong Ziya’s character, it was really in his character to do such a thing.

After a moment of silence, Zhou Wen asked about the situation of the people he cared about. Ming Xiu had always paid attention to them and told Zhou Wen one by one.

Ya’er was taken back to the An family by An Sheng and was pampered by Ouyang Lan. To everyone’s surprise, even An Tianzuo doted on Ya’er greatly. Ya’er was now like a princess of the An family. She could have anything she wanted.

Li Xuan had been wandering around. Every time he returned to Luoyang, he would visit ‘Zhou Wen’ but in fact, he was visiting Ya’er.

As for who was impersonating the An family’s Zhou Wen, Ming Xiu didn’t know either. He only felt that it was extremely similar. He couldn’t tell the difference from his appearance. His aura and abilities were also very similar to Zhou Wen’s.

It was almost impossible to tell unless one was especially familiar with Zhou Wen.

The chick and antelope had also been staying at the An family’s residence. The antelope hadn’t changed much, but the chick now had the body of an eagle. The last time Ming Xiu went, he happened to see it burn a Mythical creature to death at Chess Mountain.

Feng Qiuyan had been cultivating with Ming Xiu all these years. With the Life Providences of Ming Xiu’s Peerless Duo, the two of them improved rapidly.

Of course, it was mainly because their talent and efforts were rare in this world.

Wang Lu had officially taken over the Wang family. However, no matter where she went, she would take her sister, Wang Chan.

Wei Ge replaced Shen Yuchi as the Special Investigation Bureau’s director-general. However, the Special Investigation Bureau had already severed ties with its original owner, the six families, becoming a blade in the hands of the League of Guardians.

Many people from the six families had joined the League of Guardians, but other than the Cape family, the other families were against the League of Guardians.

The Zhang family had a rule that as long as one contracted with a Guardian, they would be removed from the family tree.

As the two of them were chatting, Zhou Wen suddenly sensed that someone was secretly approaching their lounge. After carefully sensing it, he realized that it wasn’t a pure person, but a human who had contracted a Guardian. At that moment, he was walking towards the lounge in Guardian armor.
