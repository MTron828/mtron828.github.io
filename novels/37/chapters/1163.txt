Chapter 1164: Bad News

“We are already so familiar with each other. Young Master Wen, just admit it honestly. My lips are sealed,” An Sheng said with a wink.

“What do I admit?” Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat as he thought to himself, Could it be that An Sheng has discovered the secret of the phone?

“You’re actually a reincarnator, right?” An Sheng whispered.

“What’s a reincarnator? Is it some level? Or a Guardian?” Zhou Wen asked in a daze.

“Stop pretending. A reincarnator is someone who has lived once and returned to the past. Young Master Wen, you are a reincarnator, right? Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone,” An Sheng said.

Zhou Wen finally understood what An Sheng meant. He said, at a loss whether to laugh or cry, “Have you watched too much television recently? Have you been brainwashed by television?”

An Sheng smiled and said, “Young Master Wen, if you weren’t a reincarnator, how could you do so many things that seem prescient?”

“What have I done that seemed prescient?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.

An Sheng listed them one by one. “After you became Wang Mingyuan’s disciple, he entered the dimension and became an overlord of the dimension. You have a good relationship with Wang Mingyuan’s disciples. Now that Hui Haifeng has become the president of the Federation, he has developed Mythical Serums. It’s like he has a cheat code. Zhong Ziya might very well be the president of the Holy Spirit Association. That fellow, Liu Yun, has footprints all over Earth. He has entered countless mysterious dimensional zones and has stolen countless benefits. He’s known as the number one thief.

“What’s outrageous is that you have a good relationship with Li Xuan. Li Xuan is almost immortal now. Furthermore, he has an extremely good relationship with the Dugu family and has great influence. Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu both view you as their master. Now, they are known as the dual masters of swords and sabers. Their fame has shaken the Federation. They are the idols of young bladesmen. Even worse is that a random notebook you threw at her created a female Sword Immortal. Do you dare say that you aren’t a reincarnator? You must have known that they had excellent talent long ago, so you established a relationship with them, right?”

“Ah Sheng, I think with your imagination, it’s a waste of talent not to write novels.” Zhou Wen didn’t explain as he turned around and left.

In fact, Zhou Wen couldn’t explain it. Thinking about it, he really did look like a f*cking reincarnator.

“It’s just a joke. Young Master Wen, don’t be angry!” An Sheng chased after him. He was indeed joking. How could there be reincarnators in this world? However, Zhou Wen’s past was indeed like a bug in games.

Tsukuyomi sat in the stone pavilion in the yard with her phone in her hand, but she wasn’t looking at it. Instead, she stared blankly at the moon in the sky and sat motionless for a long while.

Eventually, Tsukuyomi retracted her gaze and sighed softly. She muttered to herself, “Must I really leave?”

As she muttered to herself, Tsukuyomi switched on her phone and looked at Zhou Wen’s number in the chat app. After clicking it open, she entered some words. Then, seemingly finding it inappropriate, she deleted them and wrote some words before deleting them again. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After repeating this process a few times, Tsukuyomi ultimately didn’t send the message and locked the phone.

This is my life. Why do I have to do so much? Tsukuyomi put down her phone and stared blankly at the sky. She knew that she didn’t have much time left.

In the middle of the night, an urgent message was placed on An Tianzuo’s desk. An Tianzuo read it again and again with a heavy expression.

“Overseer, did something really happen in Netherworld City?” An Sheng rushed over in a hurry without even buttoning his clothes.

This was almost impossible for An Sheng. Even in a life-and-death situation, he would tidy himself up meticulously. He wouldn’t be so flustered even if the sky collapsed.

An Tianzuo’s expression darkened as he nodded slightly and said, “Missing. Everyone has gone missing. The people we sent found Netherworld City and saw where my mother and company had stationed themselves. However, there wasn’t a single person at the camp. From the traces at the scene, I don’t know why, but they entered Netherworld City.”

“Did anyone enter Netherworld City to look for them?” An Sheng hurriedly asked.

“Yes, but they didn’t see anyone,” An Tianzuo said.

“That’s impossible. Madam and the rest are already very familiar with the situation in Netherworld City. Even if they were forced to enter, it’s impossible for them to die in such a short period of time...” An Sheng said in disbelief.

“There’s indeed no one. It’s as though they vanished into thin air,” An Tianzuo said as he stood up and said calmly, “Make preparations. I’m going to Netherworld City. Also, don’t tell An Jing about this.”

After a pause, An Tianzuo added, “Don’t tell that punk either.”

“Young Master Wen knows Netherworld City very well. If he travels with us, the chances of rescuing Madam will be much higher,” An Sheng said.

“His surname isn’t An, nor is he my mother’s son. He has no obligation to risk his life for us,” An Tianzuo said.

“But...” An Sheng wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by An Tianzuo.

“No buts. Make the preparations. Do as I say and prepare everything as soon as possible. I have to set off before noon today.” An Tianzuo waved his hand, gesturing for An Sheng to prepare.

“Yes.” An Sheng could only leave to prepare.

After some hesitation, An Sheng finally went to Zhou Wen’s yard and told him about it.

Zhou Wen’s expression turned solemn after hearing the news.

Ouyang Lan and company had long figured out the situation in Netherworld City. Even if they were forced to enter, they should have been able to come out.

Even if they couldn’t come out, it was impossible that they would die so quickly.

Now that they were nowhere to be found—either dead or alive—Zhou Wen thought of a terrifying possibility.

Could it be that they experienced all the punishments and saw the true Netherworld? Zhou Wen’s expression changed.

He remembered very clearly what City Lord Netherworld had said. The Netherworld City he saw wasn’t the real Netherworld City. Only by experiencing all the punishments could one enter the real Netherworld.

“Ah Sheng, I need to make a trip. Help me take care of this place.” Zhou Wen originally wanted to leave Ya’er behind, but to his surprise, Ya’er looked at him. Zhou Wen knew from her gaze that it was impossible to leave her here again.

“Young Master Wen, go to Netherworld City with Overseer. You can take care of each other,” An Sheng said.

“No, I’m not going to Netherworld City. I want to make a trip to the South District,” Zhou Wen said.

“South District?” An Sheng was slightly taken aback, unsure what Zhou Wen meant.

“If I’m not wrong, I have to find someone to save Sis Lan,” Zhou Wen said.

“Who?” An Sheng hurriedly asked.

“Li Xuan.” Zhou Wen knew that he had to find Li Xuan as soon as possible and get him to follow him to Netherworld City. If he wasted too much time, it would probably be useless even if he entered the real Netherworld.
