Chapter 1633 Contest of Taboo Powers

The Sword Domain produced Sword Pills without end, but in the storm, they were quickly reduced to Yin. A large number of Sword Pills vanished, unable to block the storm’s attack.

The Heaven-level wind is so powerful! Zhou Wen couldn’t retreat. At the very least, he couldn’t let the battle affect Tsukuyomi in the glacier below.

The Dragon King armor appeared as the eight Companion Beasts’ powers augmented Zhou Wen at the same time, raising his Strength greatly as his Sword Domain appeared again.

The galaxy-like Sword Pills reappeared in the storm and charged forward.

With the augmentation of the eight Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen’s Strength was still inferior to Toad Immortal, but the effects of Sword Pill particles had something to show. After the Sword Pills in front of him vanished from the storm, they quickly changed from Yin to Yang and appeared again. The endless Sword Pills constantly struck the storm. Although the storm was stronger than the Sword Domain, as long as it couldn’t destroy the Sword Domain in one fell swoop, it would be blocked by the constantly reborn Sword Pills.

The Sword Pill particles could constantly be rejuvenated, but the storm couldn’t. After a period of time, the power of the storm weakened, and the power of the Sword Domain gained the upper hand.

“Eh!” Toad Immortal looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.

He clearly felt that Zhou Wen’s strength was only at the Human Realm, but he had suddenly raised it to a level infinitely close to the Heaven level. This leap was somewhat exaggerated. Furthermore, the characteristics of the Sword Domain surprised him. It was virtually an undying power that was very rare even among Heaven-level creatures.

The torrent formed by Sword Pills tore through the storm and charged at Toad Immortal like a galaxy. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Toad Immortal sneered and opened his mouth again. However, this time, he wasn’t exhaling, but sucking

He opened his mouth and countless Sword Pill particles flew uncontrollably into it. The small mouth seemed to be able to devour everything. After the Sword Pill particles were sucked in, they immediately lost contact with Zhou Wen. This fellow still has his Void Devouring ability? It’s much stronger than the toad body from before! Zhou Wen had no choice but to stop attacking when he saw that it was useless no matter how many Sword Pill particles he had.

“How dare a mere human compete with the likes of an Immortal?” Toad Immortal said disdainfully as a golden beam seemed to flash from his mouth.

Zhou Wen didn’t see what it was, but he immediately summoned the Chaos Egg.

Pa!

The Chaos Egg was sent flying by something as solid Essence Energy Crystals appeared in large numbers. Many of the compressed and stacked numbers appeared. He’s actually not dead? Toad Immortal was slightly taken aback. In the next second, golden light flashed from his mouth again.

Zhou Wen failed to see what it was again. He condensed the Sword Domain to protect himself when the Sword Pill particles were suddenly pulled away. A force tore through the Sword Domain and struck the Chaos Egg, sending it flying again.

Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!

The golden light shimmered as it struck the Chaos Egg from different directions, sending it flying. The golden light was so fast that Zhou Wen could only see a shadow flash. He had no time to block it as he staggered from the strike. His reaction couldn’t keep up. Thankfully, the Chaos Egg was powerful enough to withstand the continuous attacks of the golden light without shattering.

This Toad Immortal seems even stronger than the Void Salamander! Zhou Wen thought about how he could defeat him. At the very least, he had to stall for time.

He hoped that if Toad Immortal continued attacking, he could accumulate a large number of high-level solid crystals and transfer them to foodie Companion Beasts like Tyrant Behemoth.

Unfortunately, Toad Immortal didn’t give him such a chance. After striking a few times, he realized that he couldn’t shatter the Chaos Egg. The golden light revealed its form and wrapped around the Chaos Egg.

It was a golden tongue that extended out of Toad Immortal’s mouth. After wrapping around the Chaos Egg, it suddenly retracted and pulled the Chaos Egg towards his mouth.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen reacted quickly. Just as he was about to be swallowed, he used instant transmission to rush out.

“You also know spatial instant transmission. Let’s see how fast you can instant transmit.” Toad Immortal snorted coldly as his golden tongue flicked again, transforming into a golden beam that flashed.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to use the Chaos Egg to block the golden tongue’s attack. At the same time, he activated the Teacher Domain. The golden tongue wrapped around the Chaos Egg again. As it pulled it into its mouth, it also used Void Absorption’s power to imprison Zhou Wen, preventing him from using spatial instant transmission to escape.

However, as he absorbed, he suddenly realized that Void Absorption’s power had decreased significantly. Unable to hold onto Zhou Wen, it allowed Zhou Wen to escape again using instant transmission.

After escaping again, Zhou Wen unsummoned Chaos Egg and used Transcendent Flying Immortal to raise his speed to its limits, leaving elegant arcs in the air. Toad Immortal’s tongue attacked several times, but it failed to touch Zhou Wen.

The Teacher Domain allowed Zhou Wen to know the trajectory of the tongue attacks. Transcendent Flying Immortal’s speed gave him the possibility of dodging. Toad Immortal was somewhat surprised. His Void Devouring and storm powers had clearly been weakened.

“Taboo power?” Toad Immortal rolled his eyes and sized up Zhou Wen with a frown.

Zhou Wen had almost shown everything he had. Apart from the Immortal Culling Sword, he didn’t have any other means. All he hoped for was to last a little longer.

During the battle, Zhou Wen consciously led the battlefield into the cosmos, but he couldn’t make it too obvious to prevent himself from being seen through by Toad Immortal; that would lead to him rushing straight for Tsukuyomi.

“You are still far from being able to use taboo powers against me.” As though confirming what power Zhou Wen was using, Toad Immortal snorted coldly and trembled. Thousands of golden beams shot out from his body.

The golden beams transformed into golden square-holed coins that flew in different directions. Like nails, they nailed into the void, turning the area into a money space. Zhou Wen immediately felt his Essence Energy rapidly vanish. He couldn’t maintain the power of the Sword Domain and the Chaos Egg and could only barely maintain the Teacher Domain.

The Teacher Domain has met its match! Zhou Wen immediately realized the problem. Toad Immortal actually had powers similar to the Teacher Domain.

Furthermore, the other party’s strength had already reached the level of a perfect domain. The Teacher Domain was ultimately at the Human Realm. Due to the power of the eight Companion Beasts, the power of the Teacher Domain was very close to the Heaven level, but it was only close. It was still much weaker than the true Heaven level.

Now, Zhou Wen found it difficult to even use spatial instant transmission.

“I never expected to encounter a human who can use taboo powers. However, I’m a progenitor when it comes to using taboo powers. Yours remain wanting,” Toad Immortal said with a sneer.
