Chapter 1239: Battle of Mount Laojun

Translator: CKtalon

No one expected An Tianzuo to be so unyielding.

Everyone knew that Smith and company were just pawns sent by the League of Guardians to test them. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that they were cannon fodder. Touching them wouldn’t affect the League of Guardians at all, but if that happened, the An family would be charged with treason against the Federation.

This was clearly not worth it, but An Tianzuo didn’t hesitate to take down everyone. Those who wanted to escape were executed on the spot. Even the spies of the various families weren’t spared.

After that, the entire Luoyang was placed on lockdown. None of the foreigners who had come to Luoyang were able to escape. All the information networks were severed in a short period of time.

Instantly, Luoyang became a blind spot.. No one knew what was happening there.

Many people were originally wondering if An Tianzuo had really captured Thief Sage. After all, this news was too sudden, but now, these people came to a realization.

An Tianzuo’s actions had made it very likely that he had captured Thief Sage. He was trying to abscond.

If he hadn’t obtained a Calamity-grade Companion Egg, An Tianzuo wouldn’t have risked being a public enemy or be willing to bear the name of a traitor and become enemies with the entire Federation.

This was equivalent to committing suicide, leaving no room for negotiation. Not only would the An family not gain any benefits from this, but they would also be targeted by the entire Federation. It was possible that they would be wiped out.

This was practically staking his life as a bet—no one would be that foolish.

The only reasonable explanation was that An Tianzuo had really obtained the Calamity-grade Companion Egg, so he had gone all out. Once he hatched the Companion Egg, he could return as a king. When that happened, no one could do anything to him. He might even rule the world.

Hermit, who was in charge of this matter, immediately thought of this possibility. He secretly rushed to Luoyang to check on the situation and realized that the An family residence had long been emptied. Only some commoners and people from Sunset College remained in Luoyang.

As they had left in a hurry, many of the troops belonging to the Sunset Army hadn’t been transferred away. However, officers at the level of Qin Wufu had already vanished. No one even cared about the Essence Gold mines. They were without a leader, and Luoyang was in chaos.

Damn it, it’s actually real. Upon seeing this situation, it was obvious to Hermit—An Tianzuo had really obtained the Calamity-grade Companion Egg and escaped.

I have to find him as soon as possible. Hermit knew that it was useless even if he caught up to An Tianzuo.

Ignoring the fact that An Tianzuo was one of the four war gods of the new era with unfathomable strength, there were also many experts of the Sunset Army and Zhou Wen around him. It was useless even if he caught up to him. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Hermit immediately contacted the League of Guardians headquarters. Unfortunately, Immortal wasn’t at the headquarters. Cave Era was presently in charge of the League of Guardians.

“Cave Era, the possibility of An Tianzuo obtaining the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg is already very high. It’s still not too late for us to chase after him.” Hermit’s meaning was obvious. He needed reinforcements.

Upon hearing that, Cave Era frowned and said, “What do you want to do?”

“I need your and Blood Shaman’s help,” Hermit said.

“Immortal isn’t around. I have to stay at the headquarters. It’s impossible for me to leave. Blood Shaman and Uesugi are in charge of the construction of Skysplit Tower. I can’t leave,” said Cave Era.

“Just leave the Skysplit Tower to Uesugi. Blood Shaman has to go. Zhou Wen has too many Companion Beasts. Together with An Tianzuo and the Sunset Army, only Blood Shaman can restrict them.”

Hermit paused for a moment before continuing, “The chance to obtain a Calamity-grade Companion Egg again is probably impossible. Even if we don’t snatch it, the six families won’t let it go. I believe you know the consequences of them obtaining it better than me. If the six families don’t succeed, will An Tianzuo let us off after hatching a Calamity-grade Companion Beast?”

“Alright, I can get Blood Shaman to help you.” The temptation of a Calamity-grade Companion Beast was just too great. Cave Era finally relented.

“I still need to gather a batch of elites from the alliance, especially those who are good at tracking and reconnaissance. We have to find An Tianzuo as soon as possible,” Hermit said.

“Failure is not an option,” Cave Era said in a deep voice.

“Just in case, I hope you can leave a time mark on Blood Shaman. It’s best if we don’t use it, but if there’s a need for your help, I hope you will provide me with your help. I must obtain the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg.” Hermit still planned for the worst.

An Tianzuo’s fame was just too resounding. The Federation was huge, and there were countless families. There were very few people who could reach An Tianzuo’s level or even match the six families.

If not for Sunset College’s Leng Zongzheng not escaping with An Tianzuo, Hermit wouldn’t have been able to guarantee that he could snatch the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg even with so many reinforcements.

Cave Era knew the significance of this operation, but she didn’t dare be careless. Just as Hermit had said, she left a time mark on Blood Shaman. If needed, she could appear beside Blood Shaman at any time.

Many of the elites in the alliance were gathered. Under Blood Shaman’s lead, they used the teleportation tunnel established by the alliance and quickly arrived near Luoyang to meet Hermit.

After Blood Shaman met Hermit, he immediately began tracking An Tianzuo and company.

Many Guardians with special abilities quickly found traces that originally didn’t exist. The group chased without stopping.

“Your Excellency Hermit, it shouldn’t be wrong. An Tianzuo and company should have fled in the direction of Mount Laojun,” a Guardian said after carefully observing the surroundings.

“An Tianzuo is indeed cunning. Even if we find them in Mount Laojun, there’s a taboo power there. We can’t use force to kill him. It won’t be easy to capture him,” said Blood Shaman.

Hermit sneered and said, “That might not be the case. Mount Laojun’s taboo power is indeed terrifying, but we don’t need to kill on it.”

Under Hermit’s lead, the group arrived at Mount Laojun.

“From the looks of it, An Tianzuo concealed his tracks very well. The six families didn’t find his trail.” Blood Shaman looked around Mount Laojun and didn’t discover anyone from the other families.

“Are you sure they are on the mountain?” Hermit asked the Guardian beside him.

“There’s no mistake. They must be on the mountain. Although they erased their auras and severed all traces, they can’t hide from my senses. They have been here,” the Guardian said with certainty.

“Up the mountain.” Hermit had great confidence in the Guardian’s abilities. He immediately led the way up the mountain and soon arrived in front of the Wordless Monument.

Without seeing anyone here, everyone continued walking up the mountain. When they were about to reach the golden peak, they finally saw many people gathered on the nearby stone steps and stone platforms. It was An Tianzuo and company; among them were Smith and the vanished spies from the various families.
