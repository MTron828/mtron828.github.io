Chapter 411 The Little Flower on the Mountain

Lu Su was reading some documents for her research when she suddenly received an emergency notice. She rushed over to take a look at the soldier’s condition and could not help but frown. “What happened to him?”“Dr. Lu, Liu Gui violated the rules. He stationed himself at the sentry post for seven days, and turned into this,” the officer said.“He stationed himself at the sentry post for seven days straight? Does he not want his life anymore?” Lu Su was slightly taken aback when she heard that. She went forward to carefully observe Liu Gui’s injuries and asked in disbelief, “He must have scratched himself, right? There’s indeed some festering, but...”

The more she looked at it, the stranger she found it. Liu Gui’s injuries seemed to have signs of rashes, but it was obvious that the rashes were no longer festering and there were signs of recovery. The situation wouldn’t have been so if the rashes had really acted up.

“We happened to meet Doctor Little Zhou earlier on. Doctor Zhou injected some medicine into Liu Gui at the sentry post, improving his condition a little. He’s much better now...” the officer explained everything that had happened earlier.

“Doctor Little Zhou? Which Doctor Little Zhou?” Lu Su found it unbelievable.

After all her research, she had ultimately failed to find a way to treat the rashes. Once it acted up, death was a certainty. According to what they said, Liu Gui had been there for seven days without dying. That was testimony to his luck. The situation back then must have been the rashes acting up, quickly turning him into a pool of blood.

According to their description, Liu Gui should already be a dead person. Even if she, Lu Su, had been present, there was no way she could have saved Liu Gui.

However, the doctor they were talking about had only given one injection to significantly improve Liu Gui. She could no longer see any signs of the rashes, so she found it unbelievable.

“It’s Dr. Zhou Wen. His identification document says that he’s an intern,” the officer replied.

Lu Su ran through all the medical team’s personnel through her mind, but they did not have such an intern doctor. There were indeed a few new interns this year, but none of them had the Zhou surname.

“Take him in for a checkup now.” Lu Su let Liu Gui in. Liu Gui could already walk on his own, but his facial injuries were rather serious.

Lu Su checked Liu Gui and treated his wounds. But this only served to surprise her more.

Liu Gui’s entire body was covered in festering rashes, which meant that the breakout was very severe. Liu Gui and company were probably not lying, but the rashes did not show any continual signs of decay. Instead, they were slowly improving.

After Lu Su’s check-up, Liu Gui had almost fully recovered from his rashes. Even if he didn’t undergo any more treatment, he would recover in a few days. However, he needed to be treated for those festering wounds or his entire body would be covered with scars.

Instead, the self-inflicted wounds were more serious. It would probably take him quite some time to treat them.

“Are you sure that the intern doctor you met is named Zhou Wen?” Lu Su asked again.

The officer answered with certainty, “It’s Doctor Zhou Wen, alright. I made sure.”

“That’s strange.” Lu Su really wanted to meet Zhou Wen and ask him what he had injected into Liu Gui, but she couldn’t recall having such a person in the medical team.

When she returned to her office, Lu Su found the medical team’s case files and saw that none of the intern doctors were named Zhou Wen. None of them had the Zhou surname.

How strange. Could it be that they were really lucky to meet a deity? Lu Su was secretly puzzled.

...

Zhou Wen was less than two hundred meters from Chess Mountain’s mountain pass. With his eyesight, he was able to see if there were any patterns on the mountain wall, so he didn’t head forward again.

Zhou Wen’s gaze constantly sized up the mountain wall and after a while, he failed to find the tiny palm symbol. Instead, he saw a strange flower.

The flower was growing on the wall of Chess Mountain and was only about ten centimeters tall. The leaves were black, but the flowers were white. The contrasting colors resembled the rock colors of Chess Mountain. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The small flower grew alone on the stone wall. There were no plants for hundreds of meters.

There must be something wrong with things that happen out of the ordinary. Zhou Wen remembered that he had been taught in school that there was no lack of terrifying plants in dimensional zones. Perhaps the flower in front of him was a terrifying plant-type dimensional creature.

Therefore, Zhou Wen’s nerves immediately tensed up when he saw the flower. It wasn’t because he was excited, but because he was wary.

Plant-type powers were often rather special. Many animal-type dimensional creatures relied on brute force to achieve victory, but that wasn’t something Zhou Wen was afraid of.

However, most plant-type dimensional creatures didn’t achieve victory through brute force. Using the knowledge he learned from school, he knew there were many flower-type dimensional creatures that killed with pollen. There were also some fungoid dimensional creatures that could give off tiny spores that could barely be seen with the naked eye. Through the respiratory tract or the gullet, or even pores, they could enter the body and parasitize humans. They treated the human body as nutrients and sucked the human to their deaths.

Zhou Wen wore the Truth Listener earring and listened to the flow of the air, but he didn’t find any tiny particles swirling over from the side of the flower. Only then did he feel relieved.

Although he didn’t know if the flower was a plant-type dimensional creature, Zhou Wen decided to stay far from it. There was nothing wrong with being careful. He didn’t want to die here for no reason.

He turned around and walked in another direction, hoping to stay away from the flower. However, just as Zhou Wen walked a few steps, he heard a voice from the flower.

“Can you hear me?” It was a woman’s voice. Although the sun hadn’t set and the sky wasn’t too dark, Zhou Wen was still alarmed.

He turned to look at the direction of the voice and saw that there was neither human nor dimensional creature. There was only the flower growing on the mountain wall.

“Can you hear me?” The flower sounded again. Strangely, the flower turned around and faced Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen shut his mouth and stared at the flower, but he slowly retreated.

Zhou Wen didn’t want to know why the strange flower could speak. He only hoped that the flower wouldn’t cause any trouble for him. He wasn’t sure if he could deal with it.

“Why do you want to leave? I just want to chat with you. Nothing else.” The woman’s voice came from within the flower again.

Call me a fool if I believe you. Such lines often appear in movies and dramas. Many men say this to women to cheat them into getting a room, Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he still retreated without answering the flower.

Zhou Wen had heard a story from his grandfather when he was young. He said that when walking in the middle of the night, one was not to answer or turn their head to look once they heard a stranger calling their name from behind; otherwise, they would die.
