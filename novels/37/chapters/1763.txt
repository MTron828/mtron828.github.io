Chapter 1764 All Plucked

This dimensional zone had appeared for a long time. By the time Ming Xiu started plucking the golden apple, there were only five golden fruits left on the tree. Ming Xiu, Feng Qiuyan, Qin Zhen, and Zhong Ziya had plucked four of them, leaving the last golden fruit.

Upon seeing another human attempt the level, everyone felt very pleased. Regardless of whether this was from Zhous or not, it was fine as long as it was plucked by a human. At the very least, the remaining five golden apples had been all taken by humans, wiping away the shame from before.

“Who is this person? Why are the ones making an attempt today all unfamiliar faces!”

“I don’t think I’ve seen this one before. It’s another young expert. From the looks of it, there are really all kinds of hidden young talents on Earth.”

“I wonder if it’s from the Zhous again.”

“I have a feeling that this guy should also be from the Zhous.”

“Another unfamiliar face. It has to be from the Zhous.”

“What do you know? All of you are only wondering if that person is from the Zhous. None of you realize what’s really important.”

“Sure, smart alec. Tell us what’s important.”

“Don’t you guys realize that this is the last golden apple? If this golden apple is plucked, the Cube’s battle should be over. Then, the person ranked first will obtain the reward. Previously, the rewards from those planets were planetary Companion Beasts. Then, if this is the dimension, what will the reward be?”

“Now that you mention it, it does seem like it. Since this is the last golden apple, this is going to determine first place.”

“In that case, if nothing goes wrong, first place will definitely be obtained by us humans. It’s either Zhou Wen’s brother or this young man…”

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be surprised when he saw the man. It was Liu Yun, who he hadn’t seen in a while.

Liu Yun was known as Thief Sage. He had many means to change his appearance, but this time, he didn’t disguise himself. Instead, he entered the Cube with his true appearance.

However, it could be seen that this fellow had carefully dressed up. He was wearing a gorgeous robe and looked like he was dressed like a cultivator. He looked mysterious, holy, and solemn.

This fellow had even dyed his hair gray. He had wiped away his usual cheeky look, and he wore a solemn expression. At a glance, he really looked lofty.

What’s this fellow thinking? Is his brain damaged? Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless.

As Thief Sage, he had stolen many things from the various families. Once people discovered what he looked like, it would probably be difficult for him to show his true face again. Once he appeared, he would be hunted by everyone.

Thankfully, few families had seen Liu Yun’s true face. There were even fewer who knew that Liu Yun was Thief Sage. Liu Yun changed from his usual self. He stood there like a lofty son of god with his arrogant and solemn expression.

Everyone waited to see how he would clear the level, but Liu Yun stood there without walking forward. He had no intention of killing the monster in the lake.

“For me to be here personally, are you not offering me the fruit immediately? Am I to personally retrieve it?” Liu Yun suddenly said as he levitated above the lake.

This sentence left everyone dumbfounded. They looked at him as though they were looking at a fool.

Someone could be impressive and be good at posturing, but one couldn’t go too far. If they went too far, they would become a fool. Now, Liu Yun had gone too far.

“Holy sh*t, does this fellow think he’s the Jade Emperor? He even wants them to offer the fruit to him. Is he crazy?”

“I think there’s a high chance that this person is crazy. Who would do something like that?”

“Is this fellow here to perform a comedic skit?”

Everyone felt that Liu Yun was posturing too much, to the point of being a little silly. Ignoring the fact that he was only a human, even a supreme existence in the dimension wouldn’t order a tree to offer up its fruit.

Just as everyone was prepared to watch a good show and wait to see how Liu Yun would finish, they saw an angry expression appear on Liu Yun’s face. He shouted coldly, “From the looks of it, you want me to do it myself?”

Just as he said that, Liu Yun reached out and grabbed at the fog in front of him.

He hadn’t moved at all since he entered. His grab looked like a joke, rendering the spectators speechless. They felt that he had definitely gone mad. However, in the next second, everyone widened their eyes. After Liu Yun casually grabbed, a golden apple appeared in his palm out of thin air and was firmly held by his fingers.

“What a chore to have me do it myself.” As Liu Yun muttered to himself, the Cube’s screen switched to the Cube’s ranking.

Instantly, the humans watching the battle fell silent. If Zhong Ziya’s performance was still within their understanding, then Liu Yun’s performance had far exceeded their understanding. They didn’t know how to describe their feelings.

“This is too sick!”

“What happened just now?”

“That works too? Is that fellow really the Jade Emperor?”

As everyone was exclaiming, the ranking changed again. A new name replaced second place.

“Zhou Wen’s Eldest Brother! Holy sh*t, no wonder he’s so strong. So he’s Zhou Wen’s eldest brother!”

“What’s up with this ranking? Why do I feel that this eldest brother is stronger than that brother from before? He should be first, right?”

“I think this one is stronger too, but they’re family anyway. It doesn’t matter who’s ahead and who’s behind.”

“Are the people from the Zhous that impressive?” “I’m afraid the Zhous will become the number one faction on Earth in the future. They are too powerful. The six families are nothing in front of the Zhous.”

“I wonder how strong that Zhou Wen is. Unfortunately, there aren’t any golden apples left. Otherwise, we could see how strong he

is.”

“I wonder how many brothers of this caliber Zhou Wen has?”

Zhou Wen didn’t do anything, but his name went viral across the Federation. Many people were discussing Ming Xiu and company, but the person who was discussed the most was Zhou Wen himself.

Although he hadn’t done anything, it was precisely because he hadn’t done anything that people wanted to know what kind of existence the person who had so many experts around him was.

However, what was strange was that although all the golden apples had been plucked, the Cube’s battle didn’t end. They could still continue entering the Cube to clear the level.

“The dimension’s dimensional zone is indeed not that simple. Just plucking the golden apple doesn’t allow one to obtain the final victory.” Zhou Wen had expected this, so he wasn’t surprised.

“Do you want to know why it didn’t end?”. Trajectory Seeking, who had been standing by the side, suddenly asked with a complicated expression.

“You know the answer?” Zhou Wen looked at Trajectory Seeking. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Of course, I’m just afraid that you won’t dare to challenge the level after I tell you,” Trajectory Seeking said with a pout.

“Tell me about it.” Zhou Wen looked at Trajectory Seeking with interest.
