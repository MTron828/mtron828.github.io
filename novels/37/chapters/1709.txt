Chapter 1710 Is It A Trap?

“Kunlun?” The woman stood in front of the north gate of Xicheng Mountain, staring at the strange mountain terrain as though she was thinking about something.

“Immortal Supremacy, do you really want to enter the mountain personally?” Wang Mingyuan, who was dressed in white, stood not far behind the woman and spoke respectfully. “Can’t I enter Kunlun?” the woman said indifferently. “Immortal Supremacy, you can go anywhere regardless of how big the world is. However, Earth hasn’t been completely breached yet, so it’s a little inconvenient. Immortal Supremacy, why do you have to enter the mountain personally? It will be fine getting a subordinate to enter the mountain with me to scout the situation,” Wang Mingyuan said.

“You don’t have to say it so tactfully. Even though I’m restricted to a certain extent on Earth”—the woman said with an indifferent expression-“so what? Ignoring the mere restriction, even if I can’t use any strength, there’s nothing on Earth that can harm me at

all.”

“You’re right, Immortal Supremacy.” Wang Mingyuan didn’t say anything else. “Why must we enter through the north gate?” the woman asked as she looked at the mountain entrance.

“Out of the nine gates of Kunlun, there are only the east, west, south, and north gates that remain unhidden. The other five gates are hidden. I only know three of the five hidden gates. The things I see when I enter Kunlun Mountain from those three gates are completely different. Entering Kunlun through the four gates results in being at different locations, but it’s only a difference in location. The things seen are the same.” Wang Mingyuan paused before continuing, “The sword I saw can only be seen by entering the four unhidden gates.” “Since the things seen from entering the four unhidden gates are the same, why don’t we enter through the other three gates? Why must we enter through the north gate?” the woman asked again.

“There’s a Mountain God Temple outside the other three gates. It’s difficult to hide our whereabouts when entering the mountain from there. The mountain is already aware, so it’s not convenient for us to do anything,” Wang Mingyuan said.

“Then let’s enter through the north gate.” The woman glanced at Wang Mingyuan and nodded slightly. “I’ll lead the way,” Wang Mingyuan said as he walked towards the mountain entrance.

The woman followed behind Wang Mingyuan unhurriedly and they entered the mountain entrance one after another.

“Junior Brother, stop walking about. Let’s enter the mountain quickly.” Liu Yun followed Zhou Wen and kept persuading him to enter the mountain quickly. “There’s no rush. Let’s walk around first.” Zhou Wen was certain that Liu Yun was hiding something from him. Furthermore, it was something very important. Otherwise, with Liu Yun’s personality, he wouldn’t be in such a rush.

Even if he was anxious, he wouldn’t reveal such a look.

“I’ll tell you the truth. I’m not the only one who knows that the sword is in Kunlun Mountain. I’m really afraid that someone else will beat us to it. Stop walking around. Let’s go in quickly.” Liu Yun knew that if he didn’t say anything, it would be impossible for him to pull Zhou Wen into the mountain.

Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun and didn’t say a word. Liu Yun said anxiously, “Don’t look at me like that. I swear that everything I said was the truth. If there’s a single false word, it will make my lower body impotent for the rest of my life.”

“You actually dared to make such a venomous oath. From the looks of it, you aren’t lying to me,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.

“Then let’s go, quickly. Time waits for no one. We have to get the sword out before the others,” Liu Yun said anxiously. “I said that I believe you, but I didn’t say that I’ll enter the mountain now. I’ll walk around first,” Zhou Wen said as he continued walking forward, ignoring whether Liu Yun followed.

“Junior Brother, don’t you realize what’s happening now? Don’t throw a tantrum. If that sword is snatched by someone else, won’t that suck for us? When the time comes, it would be too late for regret,” Liu Yun said gloomily.

“Then tell me. Who will beat us to it?” Zhou Wen had no intention of turning back as he continued walking forward.

“About that…” Liu Yun was stunned.

“You weren’t the one who discovered the sword in Kunlun Mountain,” Zhou Wen suddenly said. “How did you know?” Liu Yun was slightly taken aback.

“You are good at stealing, and there’s nothing in such a place that you can steal. Without knowing what’s inside, you definitely won’t go in for a stroll,” Zhou Wen said.

“Alright, I admit that I didn’t discover it.” Liu Yun knew that he couldn’t fool Zhou Wen, so he didn’t deny it.

“Jing Daoxian discovered it?” Zhou Wen asked again.

The only person who could find such a strange place was probably that strange old man. “You guessed wrongly this time. This place wasn’t found by the old fellow first.” Liu Yun’s answer exceeded Zhou Wen’s expectations.

“Who is it?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

“I can tell you, but you have to promise me that you will immediately follow me into the mountain when you know the answer,” said Liu Yun.

“Then it’s best I don’t know.” Zhou Wen continued walking forward. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Liu Yun burned with anxiety as he said helplessly, “It’s our human traitor teacher who discovered it. He also made a deal with the old fellow and got me to get you to retrieve the sword. However, he told me not to tell you

yet.”

“Human traitor?” Zhou Wen was taken aback before he realized what Liu Yun meant.

“Why didn’t he tell me himself?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“I don’t know. He only told the old fellow that the Immortals are very interested in that sword. We have to take it before the Immortals do. We might be too late if we delay our entry. It’s best if you quickly enter the mountain with me,” said Liu Yun.

“It doesn’t make sense.” Zhou Wen had no intention of turning back.

“What do you mean it doesn’t make sense? What I said was true. If I lie to you, I’ll let you remove my head and use it as a toilet.” Liu Yun was really anxious.

“I mean, this entire matter doesn’t make sense.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and continued, “Teacher discovered this place first, right?”

“That’s right.” Liu Yun nodded.

“Since he was the one who discovered it first, he could have informed me earlier even if it wasn’t convenient for him to retrieve the sword. Why did he have to wait until the Immortals are about to arrive before getting you to take me to retrieve the sword?” Zhou Wen pondered. “Perhaps he can’t do so in the dimension because of the situation and he didn’t have the chance to inform you,” said Liu Yun.

“If it’s really that urgent, why would he take such a huge detour? He even wants you to take me there and not tell me the news directly?” Zhou Wen turned around and said to Liu Yun, “After your grandfather received the news, he probably spent quite some time understanding the situation inside, right?”

“You know that too?” Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.

“With that old man’s personality, how can he easily trust others? Furthermore, he’s risking his grandson’s life. If he doesn’t figure out the situation inside, how can he let you take me in?” Zhou Wen said.

“Now that you mention it, it does seem to be the case,” Liu Yun said gloomily. “Are you telling me that Teacher wants to scam us?” “I don’t think he will scam us. Perhaps he’s just using us as two chess pieces,” Zhou Wen said distractedly. His gaze and attention were attracted by the scenery ahead.
