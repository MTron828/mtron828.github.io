Chapter 1282: Embodiment of Evil

Nether Lotus seemed to realize that she had slipped up and immediately shut up.

“Sigh… I heard from my elders that that dimensional zone might be where Earth’s Companion Beast resides, but I was captured by that evil human just as I arrived on Earth,” Ice Maiden said pretentiously.

In fact, her situation was similar to what she had said. Her emotions were also rather real.

“You were also captured by him?” Nether Lotus seemed to find it unbelievable.

Ice Maiden said with a shameful look, “You will not believe the evil humans are capable of. It’s practically perverted, and he’s even worse than a pervert. If I don’t obey his orders, he will first sever my limbs and then cook them before forcing me to…”

The more Nether Lotus heard, the more horrified she became. She was really frightened. Although death was very frightening to her, she could still overcome some psychological barriers.

However, what Ice Maiden said was something she couldn’t tolerate. Just the thought of it made her shudder as her body trembled.

If she were to be treated that way, she would rather die. Nether Lotus had constructed Zhou Wen as an evil super pervert inwardly.

“Before me, many dimensional creatures had already suffered his abuse. They lived a life worse than death. In the end, they were killed and made into xiaolongbao when he got sick of them… Don’t you know what xiaolongbao is? It’s the kind of mincemeat stuffing…” As Ice Maiden spoke, she thought to herself,?It’s better to have one dead than both. If the Flower Goddess descends, you will die no matter what. Just shoulder my blame for me.

“Despicable human, how dare he treat us like this? When my mother comes, she’ll definitely rip him to pieces. No, we’ll let him have a taste of his own medicine before killing him,” said Nether Lotus through gritted teeth.

This Nether Lotus can’t be the Flower Goddess’s daughter, right!??Ice Maiden was secretly alarmed, but she pretended not to notice anything amiss. She continued, “Now that we are in his hands, we can only feign civility and preserve our usefulness. When we find an opportunity, we can kill him together. During this period of time, you mustn’t disobey him. I don’t wish to see my kind die again.”

Nether Lotus was already beginning to believe Ice Maiden. When she heard that, she said, “I understand. Don’t worry. I’ll pretend to obey him and find an opportunity to join forces with you to kill him.”

“Yes, that’s it. Preserve our lives and maintain our usefulness. Then, wait for an opportunity to kill him and avenge ourselves and our dead dimensional compatriots,” Ice Maiden said righteously.

“I’m glad I met you…” Nether Lotus nodded repeatedly.

“By the way, don’t try to escape. He has cast an evil curse on us. Once we escape, he will activate the curse. When that happens, our bodies will fester bit by bit, but we won’t die until our bodies are riddled with holes and we wail in agony for three years…” Ice Maiden continued tricking Nether Lotus.

In Nether Lotus’s mind, Zhou Wen’s evilness had increased exponentially. He was already an existence at the level of a super unparalleled demon king.

“Bear with it for the time being. I’ll quickly think of a way to get him to release you. When the time comes, you must not disobey his orders, or all our efforts will be in vain.” Before Ice Maiden left, she specially exhorted Nether Lotus.

“Got it. Thank you.” Nether Lotus’s eyes were filled with gratitude.

“When did I do those things to you?” Zhou Wen said coldly as he released Ice Maiden.

“I had no choice. I just wanted to get some information out of her. Now, we can confirm that she’s very likely the Flower Goddess’s daughter. However, she had sneaked out. The Flower Goddess doesn’t know that she’s on Earth. Also, she might have eavesdropped on the news regarding Earth’s Companion Beast from Flower Goddess and knows which dimensional zone has Earth’s strongest Companion Beast,” Ice Maiden said as she looked around.

Zhou Wen could tell what she was up to; there was no need for her to repeat herself.

“I’m afraid I’ll have to take the blame for you if the Flower Goddess really descends, right?” Zhou Wen curled his lips.

“If the Flower Goddess really descends, you will be a dead man regardless. It doesn’t matter if you take additional blame,” Ice Maiden said.

“I’ll remember this. If you can’t get any information about that dimensional zone from her, I’ll try all those methods of torture you mentioned on you,” Zhou Wen said indifferently. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Ice Maiden’s expression changed before she forced a smile and said, “I’ll do my best.”

“I don’t want you to try your best. I want you to guarantee it.” Zhou Wen had to figure out the dimensional zone.

If it was really as the dimension said—that dimensional zone was where Earth’s Companion Beast was—then he had to protect it at all costs. He definitely couldn’t let the fellows from the dimension succeed.

If they really lured Earth’s Companion Beast out, Earth would be doomed.

After handing such a mentally-taxing task to Ice Maiden, Zhou Wen began studying Absolute Space. Now, it was already ten thousand times bigger.

However, Absolute Space still remained a cubic meter in size. It didn’t continue to expand as though this was its limit.

Ten thousand times meant ten thousand meters. To light, this distance was nothing. It wasn’t enough time for Zhou Wen to react, much less dodge.

From the looks of it, even if I reach the peak of the Terror grade, I probably won’t be able to extend space sufficiently. Is there any other way??Zhou Wen felt that he couldn’t only place his hopes on Absolute Space. There wasn’t much hope of advancing it to the Calamity grade.

Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t give up on studying it. He still tried his best to perfect it, but at the same time, he began searching for more possibilities.

For a similar spatial Terror-grade skill, what if I combine Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping and Absolute Space, I wonder if it gives rise to some possibilities??Zhou Wen kept thinking about this problem.

Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping could ignore spatial distances to exchange objects, and Absolute Space was similar to a spatial bubble. Zhou Wen felt that there was a possibility stemming from the combination of the two, but he had yet to figure out how the two could be combined.

During the few days he stayed in Luoyang, there weren’t many problems with the Overseer Manor. Typically, with Qin Wufu presiding over it, Zhou Wen didn’t need to deal with the details.

Ding!

One day, when Zhou Wen was grinding the Venusian instance dungeon, another Golden Battle God Companion Egg dropped. Now, he was just short of Mark I and Mark IV before he gathered all six Golden Battle Gods.

Can six Terror-grade Golden Battle Gods fuse into a Calamity-grade Companion Beast??Zhou Wen was filled with anticipation.

If he could obtain a Calamity-grade Companion Beast, all the problems would be resolved. He wouldn’t have to go through so much trouble.

The Cube stirred again as an unfamiliar creature appeared on the platform of the Venusian dimensional zone.
