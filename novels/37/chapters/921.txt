Chapter 922: Sword Practice

Zhou Wen randomly chose a practice sword. It was the commonly seen three-foot-long sword in the East District. It was straight and light.

The type of sword was actually not important to Zhou Wen. He wasn’t planning to focus on a particular sword technique, but the thirteen sword techniques he had learned in the Peach Blossom Spring.

Strictly speaking, the sword stance wasn’t important. What was truly important was the three thousand sword intents.

After hearing the veteran’s words, Zhou Wen realized that the appearance of the sword wasn’t important. He needed to know what he could do with the sword.

“Draw your sword,” Zhou Wen said to Sadie.

Sadie didn’t hesitate as she stabbed out with her armor-piercing sword at lightning speed.

Zhou Wen struck out at almost the same time. He was as fast as lightning, just like Sadie. They were both fast-attack sword techniques.

She won! Gulli saw Sadie’s sword reach Zhou Wen’s chest first. As for Zhou Wen’s sword, it was still a distance away from Sadie. He couldn’t help but be overjoyed and nearly jumped up.

To him, being able to defeat Coach once was something worth being happy about.

Sadie never expected to win. She found it unbelievable.

“Again.” Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change as he retracted his sword.

After Sadie retracted her sword, she used the same move again. Zhou Wen did the same speed versus speed clash, but the outcome was the same. Sadie’s sword touched Zhou Wen first.

“Again,” Zhou Wen retracted his sword and continued.

Zhou Wen had only memorized the three thousand sword intents, but he hadn’t actually practiced them. Now, Zhou Wen wanted to practice using the three thousand sword intents himself to truly understand the subtlety of the sword intents.

Sadie defeated Zhou Wen for a few consecutive rounds, but she was somewhat shocked.

Sadie had the Eye of Odin, so Zhou Wen’s actions looked like slow motion to her. Therefore, as long as her sword’s speed could keep up, Sadie could crack Zhou Wen’s sword techniques.

The same move against Sadie was almost doomed to failure. There was no chance of winning.

However, that wasn’t the case. Every time Zhou Wen unsheathed his sword, the sword technique seemed to become much stronger than before. It wasn’t just an improvement in technique and speed, but more importantly, the sword intent in his sword technique became stronger and stronger.

After more than ten strikes, Sadie had no choice but to use her movement technique to dodge Zhou Wen’s sword because her sword couldn’t hit him first anymore.

However, once she retreated, there was no chance of winning. Zhou Wen’s sword techniques accelerated with every strike. Soon, Zhou Wen’s sword pointed at Sadie’s chest.

“I lost.” Sadie was convinced of her defeat.

After more than ten strikes, Zhou Wen’s sword technique had actually improved greatly. It was unimaginable.

Just imagine a person who was easily defeated by you more than ten times. Then, after more than ten strikes, you were no longer their match. How terrifying was that?

However, Sadie wasn’t too surprised that such a thing had happened to Zhou Wen. Gulli and Li Xuan weren’t surprised either. This was because he was Coach. It wasn’t unacceptable that he could defeat Sadie.

Zhou Wen retracted his sword and seemed to ponder for a moment before saying, “Continue.”

Sadie didn’t know what was the point of continuing practicing. Zhou Wen’s fast sword was something she could see, but not dodge. There was no point in continuing.

However, since Zhou Wen wanted to continue, Sadie had no choice but to continue.

However, this time, Sadie realized that Zhou Wen’s sword art was different. This time, Zhou Wen’s attack wasn’t that fast or offensive. It seemed to have become a defensive sword art.

Strangely, the sword move Zhou Wen used was still the same.

The same sword move but with a completely different sword intent. The effects of the sword art seem to have completely changed. How did he do it? Sadie was somewhat surprised as she knew why Zhou Wen wanted to continue.

However, this time, Zhou Wen was quickly defeated. This was because he was focused on defending and counterattacking, but due to the existence of the Eye of Odin, it was very difficult to defend against Sadie’s attacks.

“Continue.” Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change as he fought Sadie again.

After repeated failures, it became more and more difficult for Sadie to defeat Zhou Wen. Almost in the same manner as before, Sadie realized that she had no way of breaking through Zhou Wen’s defensive sword technique.

In the end, Sadie lost again.

However, Zhou Wen still wanted to continue. Furthermore, the sword art he used was still the same, but the sword intent had changed.

“What’s going on? Coach used a sword art with three different sword intents? How did he master it?” Gulli was dumbfounded.

“I don’t know, but from the looks of it, there are more than three types of sword intents,” Li Xuan said.

Gulli was slightly stunned. “More than three? Are you joking? Mastering three or more sword intents for one sword art isn’t something a human can do, right?”

“He’s Zhou Wen,” Li Xuan said as he stared intently at Zhou Wen.

Just as Li Xuan had said, Zhou Wen didn’t just have three sword intents. In fact, it wasn’t a human sword art. The white-robed man from the Peach Blossom Spring was no longer human, so his sword art was naturally not a human sword art. Even the white-robed man couldn’t believe that Zhou Wen could memorize three thousand sword intents. It was obvious how unbelievable the sword art was.

“Four... Five... Six... Heavens... How many sword intents has Coach mastered?” Gulli felt like he was dreaming.

From the beginning until now, Zhou Wen had already used more than ten sword intents. He was basically beating Sadie in all kinds of fancy ways.

Regardless of which sword intent it was, it would gradually become stronger in Zhou Wen’s hands before defeating Sadie. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Sadie felt terrible, but at the same time, she was very excited. She was also a sword practitioner. To be able to face so many types of sword intents was of great help to her. Her understanding of the sword deepened as her sword techniques became stronger.

However, the speed at which she became stronger clearly couldn’t keep up with Zhou Wen. As Zhou Wen used different sword intents, Gulli was already dazzled. He couldn’t remember how many sword intents Zhou Wen had used.

“Is this fellow really human?” Gulli looked at Zhou Wen as though he was looking at a monster.

“Without a doubt, Zhou Wen is physiologically human. Since he can do it, it means that this path is feasible,” Li Xuan said.

“I don’t know if this path will work. In any case, I won’t be capable of doing it. Besides, there’s no need for that, right? Just cultivating a single sword intent to the extreme is enough to defeat an opponent. Why do you have to cultivate so many different sword intents?” Gulli gave up. He had seen so many sword intents and felt that his mind was in a mess.

“Zhou Wen naturally has his reasons for doing so. I haven’t figured it out yet,” Li Xuan said seriously.

“Forget it. Take your time. Anyway, I’m only a human. I won’t get involved with monsters like you guys.” Gulli felt that he had come to the wrong place.

In the past, when he was in the Ultimate Family Clan, he was still considered a genius. Apart from existences like Lance and Sadie, he was always basking in the limelight.

However, ever since he had entered the Xuanwen Club, he felt like he had entered a perverted concentration camp, and he was one of the more normal ones.
