Chapter 1405: Essence Crystal Mine

Translator: CKtalon

“Adjutant An, when is it convenient for Mr. Zhou? Let’s trade the Heavenly Robe as soon as possible.” Wood and the other representatives of the Cape family couldn’t sit still any longer. They took the initiative to look for An Sheng.

“Sorry, something happened here…” An Sheng wore a difficult expression.

“What’s wrong?” Wood asked patiently, but he was already burning with anxiety.

After watching Zhou Wen’s performance, everyone believed that the Heavenly Robe was an excellent-grade Companion Beast. The master of the Cape family had already ordered them to bring it back as soon as possible.

“Well, someone offered a higher price than your family… As you know… My Young Master is already a little impatient with your many requests… Furthermore, others are handing over the physical goods directly…” An Sheng stammered.

“Adjutant An, we do have a contract. With the An family’s status, you wouldn’t go so far as to violate the contract for such trivial gains, right?” Wood immediately reeled in anxiety.

He also knew that the display of Heavenly Robe’s abilities was shocking. Furthermore, the Cube had given a five-star evaluation, allowing Zhou Wen to reach first place. Who in the Federation didn’t want the Heavenly Robe?

The headlines of the various media outlets were all reporting about Zhou Wen and Heavenly Robe. Anyone with the means was probably eyeing the Heavenly Robe now.

“We don’t want to break the contract either, but you know the abilities of the League of Guardians. Now that they want the Heavenly Robe, do we dare not give it to them?” An Sheng sighed.

“So what if it’s the League of Guardians? Even if Immortal himself comes, he has to be reasonable, right? Why don’t we do this? Adjutant An, get Mr. Zhou to complete the handover as soon as possible. If the League of Guardians wants to force it, get them to cause trouble for our Cape family…” Wood said.

“This… The risk we take is too great…” An Sheng looked conflicted.

“Adjutant An, help us settle this matter. The Cape family definitely won’t treat you unfairly… This is a token from our Cape family…” Wood stuffed something into An Sheng’s hands. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“No, no, no. This isn’t appropriate, right?” An Sheng said, but he turned sideways and unzipped a pocket on his jacket with one hand.

…

Wood had already requested permission several times. Now, it wasn’t just Wood. The upper echelons of the Cape family were filled with regret.

If they had known this would happen, they would have just bought the Heavenly Robe back then without all the fuss. However, by making a fuss, the price they had to pay now was ten percent higher than before.

Even so, the Cape family was willing to pay. They were now afraid that Zhou Wen wouldn’t sell the Heavenly Robe to them.

From their point of view, it was only because the An family needed a large number of Essence Crystals for the accelerator. Otherwise, no faction would exchange such a Companion Beast for Essence Crystals.

Finally, they reached a new agreement. Even an important member of the Cape family, Woods, rushed over overnight and prepared to personally receive the Heavenly Robe.

“As long as we can bring the Heavenly Robe back, it will all be worth it. We have to be fast and not delay any further. Otherwise, the problem with the Essence Crystal mine will be exposed. When the time comes, it won’t be that easy to exchange for the Heavenly Robe again.” When Woods arrived, the family head’s exhortations were still ringing in his ears.

Woods knew that this matter couldn’t be delayed. After rushing to Luoyang, he immediately contacted An Sheng and Zhou Wen to head to the Essence Crystal mine with him to carry out the transaction.

The location of the Essence Crystal mine wasn’t very far from Luoyang. Coincidentally, it was near Guide City. The dimensional zone was originally under Guide City’s jurisdiction, but it was no longer inhabited. There were dimensional zones everywhere.

I never expected there to be an Essence Crystal mine here.?Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with this place. His grandfather had brought him here a few times when he was young.

Back then, this was a mausoleum. It had turned into a valley at some point in time. Flowers bloomed everywhere in the valley as butterflies fluttered in the air.

As there were many dimensional zones nearby, there were many break-out creatures everywhere. The nearby humans had long moved away and headed for relatively large human cities. The vicinity was uninhabited.

Woods led Zhou Wen and company into the valley. It was unknown when the valley had become a dimensional zone. Strangely, there were only ordinary butterflies in the valley. There wasn’t a single dimensional creature.

“The reserves of Essence Crystals here are plenty. Furthermore, the Essence Crystal mine is very close to the surface, and the purity is high…” As Woods led the way, he explained. Soon, everyone saw exposed Essence Crystal ores on the nearby mountain wall.

An Sheng hurriedly got the experts to investigate. The preliminary conclusion was better than what the Cape family had said. The reserves here were probably far more than a few thousand tonnes.

Although Woods looked calm on the surface, he felt uneasy. He knew that this place looked good, but at a certain time, it wouldn’t be as beautiful and peaceful as it was now.

He was now hoping that An Sheng and company would quickly finish the inspection and complete the handover so that they wouldn’t notice anything.

Zhou Wen had only taken a casual look and didn’t discover any problems, but the emotional fluctuations in Woods’s heart were too intense. It triggered Truth Listener’s inner thoughts.

Soon, Zhou Wen knew that the Cape family didn’t have any good intentions. This place wasn’t as peaceful as it looked.

It’s no wonder the Cape family doesn’t mine it themselves. So there’s actually something odd about it.?Zhou Wen wasn’t angry.

After all, he and An Sheng didn’t have any good intentions either. The Heavenly Robe wasn’t as perfect as it looked.

Zhou Wen remained unperturbed as he circled the valley. After weighing the pros and cons, he planned on pretending not to know anything and continue completing the deal.

Woods’s heart was in his throat while Zhou Wen wandered around, but he pretended to not care and didn’t rush Zhou Wen and An Sheng.

It had to be said that Woods was indeed a wily old fox. He was extremely worried, but his expression remained stoic. If not for Truth Listener’s ability, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been able to tell that there was anything wrong.

After all, even An Sheng couldn’t tell what was wrong, much less someone as inexperienced as Zhou Wen.

“Mr. Zhou, Adjutant An, are there any problems?” Woods said when Zhou Wen and An Sheng returned.

An Sheng looked at Zhou Wen. Clearly, he hadn’t discovered any problems. He was very satisfied with the reserves and purity of the Essence Crystals here, nor did he discover any potential danger factors in the dimensional zone.

“Mr. Woods, you should know that I’m from Guide City, right?” Zhou Wen said with a faint smile.

Woods’s heart skipped a beat, but his expression didn’t change at all. He said with a smile, “I’ve heard that Guide City is indeed an illustrious place. To be able to produce someone like Mr. Zhou and such an Essence Crystal mine means that this place is extraordinary. Unfortunately, our Cape family’s base is in the West District.. Otherwise, we would have come here to develop.”
