Chapter 1700 Karoman Is Here

Zhou Wen held the newly produced Emperor Star and hesitated about who to use it on.

This thing was an improvement for anyone who used it. It didn’t have any negative effects. With an additional Emperor’s Life Life Providence, the other aspects were enhanced.

The best choices were naturally Truth Listener and Demonic Neonate. After careful consideration, Zhou Wen decided to keep it for Demonic Neonate. He would give it to her after she completed her evolution.

It wasn’t that Zhou Wen preferred Demonic Neonate, but that the Emperor’s Life seemed to have the effect of gaining submission from dimensional creatures.

Truth Listener was a violent person. It seemed a little difficult for him to rule a group of dimensional creatures. Demonic Neonate’s sinister personality was somewhat suitable.

Unfortunately, he only had one Emperor Star. If he had a few more, he could have all of them-Dragon Eclipse, Banana Fairy, and so on-have one. That would be perfect.

Of course, this was only a thought. The treasures in hidden dungeons didn’t even respawn in-game, making it impossible for them to be mass-produced.

Zhou Wen put away the Emperor Star and summarized his various Essence Energy Arts. He planned on advancing all his Essence Energy Arts to the Calamity grade as soon as possible. Otherwise, it would always be a latent danger if he didn’t reach the Calamity grade.

Currently, the Essence Energy Arts that had condensed a Calamity Zone were the First Order of Chaos (Hell level), Qi Refinement Art (Hell level), Dao Sutra (Hell level), Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra (Heaven level), and Ancient Sovereign Sutra (Human Realm).

The only ones which hadn’t condensed a Calamity Zone were the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, Godfiend Era, and the Demon God Catalog.

Zhou Wen had no clue where to go to have Godfiend Era condense a Calamity Zone. It was very difficult to find a corresponding dimensional zone to an Essence Energy Art of unknown origins. All he could do was slowly experiment.

The Demon God Catalog had a clear dimensional zone that was compatible with it, but when he thought of The Thearch of Chess Mountain, Zhou Wen found it a little thorny.

Even without The Thearch, just the four generals of the Mo family that Zhou Wen had seen in Chess Mountain weren’t people to be trifled with. There was a high chance that they were Heaven-level existences.

With the principle of doing the easier things first, Zhou Wen planned on putting in some effort on the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art. The Endless Sea of Stars was likely compatible with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, so it shouldn’t be difficult to find an opportunity to advance to the Calamity grade.

Updates by

He opened the Endless Sea of Stars dungeon on his phone and indeed, the choice of modes appeared. Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to choose the hidden mode.

The Endless Sea of Stars looked like it corresponded to space. Every tiny planet corresponded to the stars in the universe. As there were too many stars, Zhou Wen could only slowly wander the Endless Sea of Stars. As he hunted dimensional creatures in the Endless Sea of Stars, he searched for the location of the hidden dungeon.

Zhou Wen’s luck was pretty good. He found the suspected hidden dungeon after searching for a few days.

It was a tiny, inconspicuous planet. It was barren with nothing but rocks. Even dimensional creatures didn’t stay on it.

If it were any other time, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have paid attention to this place, but under hidden mode, the tiny planet emitted a black glow.

From the looks of it, it should be here. Zhou Wen didn’t discover anything special about the tiny planet and prepared to land on it to take a closer look.

It looked like an ordinary planet, but when the blood-colored avatar landed on it, it suddenly felt an unparalleled suction force pull at its body, causing it to collapse to the ground.

Although Zhou Wen hadn’t advanced to the Calamity grade, he had a few Calamity-grade Essence Energy Arts. His physique wasn’t something ordinary Terror-grade creatures could compare with.

The suction force of the tiny planet prevented Zhou Wen from escaping as he was sucked to the ground. Its strength was unimaginable.

Zhou Wen first used the Calamity-grade Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power to attempt to stand up, but he realized that he couldn’t escape.

Following that, he switched to the Qi Refinement Art, but it still didn’t work. He even used the Heaven-level Small Perfection of Wisdom only to fail at standing up.

The suction force on the small planet seemed infinite. No matter how powerful his strength was, it was difficult to escape it.

After Zhou Wen used the Teacher Domain, he was finally liberated from the suction force, allowing him to fly freely on the tiny planet.

The Dao Sutra is still reliable at critical moments. Zhou Wen sighed as he slowly searched the entrance of the hidden dungeon on the tiny planet.

To his surprise, after searching the entire planet, he didn’t find anything abnormal. Naturally, he didn’t find the entrance to the hidden dungeon.

This is strange. This should be the entrance to a hidden dungeon. Why can’t I find an entrance? Zhou Wen attempted to push the tiny planet to see if it was like the Purple Star Palace. Only by pushing the planet could he trigger the entrance to the hidden dungeon.

The planet didn’t budge. Even Great Brahma’s power couldn’t move it at all.

From the looks of it, the way to enter isn’t to push this tiny planet. Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and switched his Essence Energy Art to the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art. He deactivated all the other Essence Energy Arts.

After retracting the Teacher Domain, even with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art activated, Zhou Wen’s body was still sucked to the ground. However, this time, it was somewhat different.

His body lay on the hard rocks, but he felt that the rocks no longer looked like rocks. They seemed to turn into some liquid or bubbles as his body gradually sank into the tiny planet.

…

Li Xuan had been very busy recently, giving him the urge to learn a clone technique.

Zhou Wen was a boss who didn’t do anything. He had to worry about the hundreds of thousands of people in Guide Ancient City. Although he had the Zhang and Xia families to share the burden, they weren’t one of them after all. It wasn’t convenient to leave certain matters to them.

When will Ming Xiu and Little Yanyan return? The other representatives are back. What’s taking them so long? Li Xuan began to miss the two oddities.

When the two of them were around, Li Xuan would sometimes have a headache due to their annoying antics, but now that they were really gone, he felt that something was missing. At the very least, no one was helping him with the chores.

“Brother Xuan, bad news. Something bad has happened.” A fashionably-dressed young man rushed over and shouted as he ran.

Li Xuan looked at the young man’s attire and found it irksome no matter how he looked at it. He thought to himself, I have to think about designing a uniform later. Otherwise, these civil servants will look like hooligans and affect our image. I’ll discuss it with Old Zhou when I have the time. However, with that fellow’s odd aesthetic sense, it’s probably useless discussing it with him.

“What’s the fuss? Don’t you know how to be steady? You are now the captain of Guide Ancient City’s city guard. Look at you?” Li Xuan first reprimanded the youth before asking, “What happened?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Karoman… Karoman is at the city gates… He said he wants to see our City Lord Zhou Wen…” The youth forced himself to calm down, but his tone was still somewhat flustered.

Although the entire world acknowledged that Karoman was inferior to Human Sovereign, no one treated Human Sovereign as a human. In the hearts of the average person, he was still an invincible existence.

“What’s he doing here?” Li Xuan frowned slightly, unsure what Karoman’s goal was. All he could do was head out to meet him and figure out his goal.
