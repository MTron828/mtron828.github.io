Chapter 231 Fight to the Death

The chick that had been standing on Zhou Wen’s shoulder suddenly spat out a golden flame that sprayed onto the black-armored, white-haired ghost’s palm.

When the golden flame touched the white-haired ghost’s palm, it was as if a spark had encountered gasoline. It immediately ignited and the ghastly hand caught fire.

Good bird. Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he turned around and continued fleeing.

Although the chick was magical, it had not long been born. Its level was too low now, so no matter how powerful its flames were, it would probably not be able to burn the black-armored, white-haired ghost to death.

Indeed, the black gas emitted by the black-armored, white-haired ghost surged out, extinguishing the golden flames that engulfed his palm. His charred palm also rapidly recovered amidst the black gases, and his eyes showed anger as he chased again.

What a haunting presence! Zhou Wen suddenly felt that at times, people really couldn’t believe in superstitions. Ever since he had the Bamboo Blade, his luck had really deteriorated significantly.

On this return trip, a new dimensional zone had appeared out of nowhere. There were even creatures that had broken out of containment and they were unlucky enough to encounter them.

Truth Listener and Banana Fairy rushed over to help Zhou Wen fend off the black-armored, white-haired ghost. Zhou Wen had also pushed Dragon Gate Fairy Skill to its limits, hoping to escape the calamity. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, the black-armored, white-haired ghost had extremely high intelligence. He already knew that Truth Listener’s and Banana Fairy’s weakness was that their levels weren’t high, so he ignored them. He sent them flying and continued targeting Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen kept ordering Ghost Bride to fight, but all she did was tremble as she slowly floated towards the black-armored, white-haired ghost. Clearly, she was horrified.

Zhou Wen dodged in the air like an eagle several times, but he failed to completely dodge the black-armored, white-haired ghost’s palm attacks. He was just seconds from having his neck grabbed.

Seeing his furious gaze, Zhou Wen had no doubt that he would snap his neck.

After I return, I’ll definitely stay at home and game in peace. I won’t come out again no matter what, Zhou Wen thought to himself as he prepared to activate his Sigh of the King.

Although the Sigh of the King was potent, his body couldn’t withstand such immense power. Furthermore, it was unknown if it was effective against the black-armored, white-haired ghost, but now, using it meant a last-ditch effort. If his attack failed, death was certain for him.

The white-haired ghost dodged the flames spewed out by the chick. Just as it was about to grab Zhou Wen, a bolt of lightning suddenly descended from the sky and struck the white-haired ghost’s head. It was Li Xuan who cleaved down with the Thundergod Sword.

The white-haired ghost frowned slightly. He moved his body sideways and flipped his hand, sending the ghastly gases to blast Li Xuan and his sword away.

Bam!

Li Xuan’s body slammed into the ground paved with stones, shattering the area.

“Li Xuan!” Zhou Wen cleaved at the white-haired ghost while shouting.

Li Xuan did a backflip from the rubble and charged at the white-haired ghost again, his Thundergod Sword weighing him down.

The white-haired ghost’s figure flashed as he grabbed the Bamboo Blade with one hand and grabbed the Thundergod Sword with the other. He violently flung Zhou Wen and Li Xuan to the ground.

As gravel flew, Zhou Wen felt his face deform from being smashed. It was possible that his bones were fractured as blood gushed out from his nose.

Li Xuan’s condition wasn’t any better as he crashed into the stony earth.

The white-haired ghost’s body descended and its feet were just about to step on both of their heads.

Bam!

Ah Lai rushed over and kicked the white-haired ghost in the chest, sending him flying backward.

Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate any further as he channeled the Sigh of the King. Instantly, the strange power blasted out like a volcanic eruption.

A beam of light descended on Zhou Wen. Li Xuan and company couldn’t see the shadow, but Zhou Wen could sense that it was a woman, but he couldn’t see her clearly.

Terrifying power instantly filled Zhou Wen’s entire body, making him feel like he could blast through everything.

He was unwilling to waste any more time since the Sigh of the King’s power only grew stronger. If too much time passed, the power might explode his body. Zhou Wen had to finish off the Ghost King before his body crumbled.

Seeing the Ghost King charge at him again, Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to use Transcendent Flying Immortal. His body transformed into a lightning flash as he faced the black-armored, white-haired ghost.

Crack!

The Bamboo Blade slashed at the Ghost King’s black armor once again, tearing open a deep rift. The black gas in it immediately surged out like a fountain.

The black-armored, white-haired ghost’s expression changed. His figure flashed like a ghost and disappeared into thin air. The subsequent attacks of Transcendent Flying Immortal missed due to the target suddenly disappearing

When the black-armored, white-haired ghost appeared again, it was already tens of meters away. Its trajectory didn’t show, as though it had teleported over.

Zhou Wen felt the power in his body turn increasingly violent. Without any hesitation, he used Transcendent Flying Immortal again.

Originally, with his Primordial Energy, he could only use Transcendent Flying Immortal once before being enervated. However, with the Sigh of the King, Zhou Wen felt that he could use Transcendent Flying Immortal countless times. He didn’t need to worry about over-exerting his Primordial Energy, as though his body had infinite Primordial Energy.

This feeling made Zhou Wen excited and extremely worried. He was like a baby swinging a sledgehammer-he could hurt himself at any moment due to his lack of power. His body’s strength was insufficient to control the Sigh of the King.

Transcendent Flying Immortal streaked across the sky instantly and appeared in front of the black-armored, white-haired ghost. However, his figure phased away and vanished once again. It made Zhou Wen unable to sense his aura, preventing him from locking onto it. This Transcendent Flying Immortal missed again.

Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly as his body showed signs of overexertion. If he couldn’t quickly finish off the white-haired ghost soon, he would probably implode.

However, the white-haired ghost possessed a technique that was similar to teleportation. No matter how strong or fast he was, it was useless if he couldn’t touch the white-haired ghost.

When the white-haired ghost appeared again, Li Xuan charged forward and slashed at its head with the Thundergod Sword.

The white-haired ghost was somewhat afraid of Zhou Wen’s strength, but he thought nothing of Li Xuan. With a slight blink, he dodged Li Xuan’s Thundergod Sword and pressed Li Xuan’s head to the ground with one hand.

Bam!

Rocks flew everywhere as Li Xuan’s head crashed into a huge crater on the ground. Blood splattered out along with the rubble.

Zhou Wen was alarmed. This strike had probably crushed Li Xuan’s head.

However, just as the white-haired ghost was about to retract his hand, Li Xuan suddenly grabbed his arm with both hands and leaped up. He clung tightly to the white-haired ghost and shouted at Zhou Wen, “Kill him!”
