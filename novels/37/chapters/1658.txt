Chapter 1659 Choosing My Own Path

Zhou Wen’s hair stood on end when he heard that. Such a powerful existence had actually vanished from Earth. It was no wonder the terrifying existences in the dimension were so wary of Earth.

“After the Immortals suffered that heavy blow, the six Holy races were able to rise up and become the rulers of the dimension. Even so, they needed the six races to join forces to suppress the heavily weakened Immortals. After so many years, even if the six Holy races join forces, it will be difficult for them to completely suppress the present-day Immortals. The possibility of them ruling the world again is very high.”

Wang Mingyuan paused for a moment before continuing, “The descent of the dimension is inevitable. The various races will seek out their representatives on Earth. The Immortals hope that you can become their representative. If you agree, the matter between Perfect Sword Immortal and Berserker Immortal will be written off.”

“If I become the representative of the Immortals, wouldn’t that be equivalent to helping the Immortals destroy Earth?” Zhou Wen said after some thought. Wang Mingyuan smiled and said, “Then you have to ask yourself.” Zhou Wen looked at Wang Mingyuan in a daze, unsure what he meant. Without explaining, Wang Mingyuan threw an item at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen caught it and saw that it was an ice crystal-like ring.

“You are already at the age where you can make your own choices. Think about it slowly. If you are willing to become the representative of the Immortals, crush that ring,” Wang Mingyuan said as his figure gradually turned ethereal, as though he was about to turn transparent. “Teacher, if it were you, what would you choose?” Zhou Wen asked.

“My path might not be suitable for you,” Wang Mingyuan said as he finally turned around. His transparent body floated in the air as he looked gently at Zhou Wen and said, “Some people choose to walk towards heaven, while others choose to walk towards hell. No matter where they go, they just have to follow their hearts.

“If you walk to hell one day, don’t be afraid or hesitant. Stretch out your hand. There will definitely be a hand waiting for you at a spot within reach.” With that last word, Wang Mingyuan’s body completely vanished.

Zhou Wen looked at the spot where Wang Mingyuan had vanished and didn’t move for a long time.

“In an era where all the gods are about to descend to the mortal world, what’s the difference between walking to heaven and walking to hell?” After a long while, Zhou Wen sighed and put away the ring.

When he returned to Guide City, he found the situation there wanting. Li Xuan, Qin Zhen, Feng Qiuyan, Ming Xiu, and company were busy fighting everywhere to ensure the safety of the base.

Recently, more and more break-out creatures had rushed out of dimensional zones near Guide City. If not for the fact that Li Xuan and company were top experts among humans, the base would have long been razed to the ground.

Even with so many experts gathered in Guide City, ordinary citizens had recently suffered casualties. Although there weren’t many, it was enough to make one wary.

“Old Zhou, you’re finally back. We have to find the dimensional zone to build a city as soon as possible. There’s no way to defend this crappy place,” Li Xuan said gloomily when he saw Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen saw that Li Xuan wasn’t in a good mood. His eyes were bloodshot. If even Li Xuan, who had an almost immortal body, looked so exhausted, the others must be suffering even more. “It’s time to find a dimensional zone to build a city. Is Xia Xuanyue still here?” Zhou Wen knew that it would probably be difficult to find a suitable dimensional zone to build a city in a short period of time. If there was no other way, he could only cooperate with the Xia family.

“She’s been here the entire time and has helped us quite a bit. Recently, there have been too many break-out creatures appearing. We don’t have enough manpower, and Xia Xuanyue and the Xia family have contributed quite a bit,” Li Xuan said.

“Then I’ll meet her.” Upon hearing Li Xuan’s words, Zhou Wen knew that Li Xuan had tacitly agreed to cooperate with the Xia family.

The Xia family was quite sincere. Break-out creatures had recently appeared with high frequencies. Many families that had come to observe had already evacuated Guide City.

For Xia Xuanyue to still lead people to help guard the base at this time showed the Xia family’s sincerity.

“By the way, Sis Yuzhi is here. She has been of great help to us recently,” Li Xuan hurriedly added when he saw Zhou Wen preparing to leave.

“Why is she here? Who else from the Zhang family is here?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.

Others might not know Zhang Yuzhi’s background, but Zhou Wen knew very well that the entire Zhang family treated her like a treasure, afraid that anything would happen to her.

Ignoring a dangerous place like Guide City, even in the Zhang family’s dimensional zone, Zhang Yuzhi would have many people protecting her.

The Zhang family had actually sent Zhang Yuzhi to Guide City, exceeding Zhou Wen’s expectations.

“There’s also Zhang Xiao and a White Crane team. From what Sis Yuzhi said, the Zhang family seems interested in investing in us.” Li Xuan’s tone suddenly turned suggestive as he lowered his voice and said, “However, I don’t know if the Zhang family is interested in us or if Sis Yuzhi is interested in someone.”

“What are you talking about?” Zhou Wen glared at him angrily. “With Sis Yuzhi’s importance to the Zhang family, if it wasn’t for the Zhang family’s ulterior motives, how could they have let her come here? Even if Sis Yuzhi agreed, the Zhang family wouldn’t have let her come.”

“Hehe, that might be exactly what they want. Speaking of which, you aren’t young anymore. Although Sis Yuzhi is a little older than us, she’s definitely not considered old. It’s not bad to have a mature woman, so consider it,” Li Xuan said with a silly smile. “You still have time to think about this. From the looks of it, there’s no rush to build a city,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“Don’t, it’s best if you quickly find a dimensional zone to build the city. If this continues, even if I can hold on, the others will collapse,” Li Xuan hurriedly said.

“Where are Xia Xuanyue and Sis Yuzhi now?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.

“They are all in the Fuyue Estate. A group of dimensional creatures was cleared last night. They are probably resting now. Xia Xuanyue and the Xia family live in Block 9 while Sis Yuzhi and Zhang Xiao live in Block 10.” Li Xuan gave Zhou Wen the detailed address.

“Why did you arrange for them to be so close?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.

Li Xuan said helplessly, “I didn’t arrange it. They requested it themselves. The Xia family and the Zhang family have a good relationship. They said that they can take care of each other by living closer to each other.”

Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else. After bidding Li Xuan farewell, he headed for the Fuyue Estate and quickly arrived at the district.

After some hesitation, Zhou Wen walked towards Block 9, hoping to discuss the dimensional zone with Xia Xuanyue.

“Zhou Wen.” Just as he was about to reach Block 9, he heard someone call his name. He turned his head and saw Zhang Yuzhi standing at the entrance of Block 10, waving at him. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Zhou Wen, you’re here for me, right?” Just as Zhou Wen was about to turn around and walk over, he realized that Xia Xuanyue had walked out of Block 9 and greeted him with a smile.
