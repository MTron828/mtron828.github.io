Chapter 1431: Self-Destruction

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen pushed Truth Listener and Great Brahma’s powers to their limits. With the augmentation of The Disqualified, he forcefully blocked and dodged Xiao’s attack.

However, Xiao’s strength and speed had exceeded the limits of Zhou Wen’s abilities. The light shimmering over his body illuminated the entire Venusian dimensional zone.

The intense silver sword beams crisscrossed. The blinding light made it impossible to see what was happening inside. All one could see was the blinding sword beams on the screen intensify. Apart from that, nothing else could be seen.

Zhou Wen kept retreating. He could only constantly move and position himself to deal with Xiao’s attacks by relying on his judgment and blind guesses.

Crack! Crack!

Zhou Wen’s Prisoned Dragon armor was penetrated again and again. This time, not only did it penetrate the armor, but even his bones and flesh were penetrated. It nearly injured Zhou Wen’s vital spots several times.

Although the spectators couldn’t see the battle inside, the powerful sword beam was enough to let everyone know what was happening.

“Human Sovereign… Hold on…” Everyone found it difficult to speak. All they could do was pray inwardly. They clearly couldn’t see anything, but they still stared intently at the screen. Their eyes were blinded by the light as they cried. They just couldn’t bear to look away.

The countdown ticked by, and Xiao had yet to kill Zhou Wen when there were less than ten seconds left.

Ten… Nine… Eight… Seven…?Zhou Wen kept counting silently in his heart. He could also tell that Xiao’s rampage would only result in one outcome—death.

He was counting the time. As long as he waited for Xiao to self-destruct, he would activate the Chaos Egg to forcefully block the energy of the self-destruction. He would then clinch the final victory.

In the Holy Land, Holy God also looked at the Cube’s countdown. At the same time, he stared at Xiao.

If Xiao could kill Human Sovereign before the countdown ended, he could stop Xiao’s self-destruction. Otherwise, he could only let Xiao die.

However, it was probably impossible for Xiao to kill Human Sovereign before the Cube’s countdown based on the present situation.

Forget it. It’s his fate.?With only two seconds left on the countdown, Holy God was unwilling to wait any longer. Furthermore, he didn’t wish for any accidents to happen. He was just one thought short of detonating Xiao.

In the Venusian dimensional zone, the light on Xiao’s body had already materialized. Zhou Wen felt his strength instantly swell and knew that it was time. Just as Zhou Wen was about to summon the Chaos Egg to withstand it, an unexpected change happened.

Xiao’s power came from his Guardian armor. As for the Guardian armor, it had advanced to the Calamity grade because it had fused with Holy God’s avatar.

In theory, Xiao was only at the Epic stage. With the Guardian armor being controlled by the Holy God, he couldn’t escape the Guardian armor.

This was because his strength was too weak. The Guardian armor was the foundation of his strength.

However, just as the Guardian armor was about to explode, the Guardian armor on Xiao’s body seemed to be teleported out and instantly vanished.

As Zhou Wen had been paying attention to Xiao, the intense Holy Light was unable to affect his Truth Listener and Great Brahma. Therefore, he could clearly see Xiao’s true body appear after the Guardian armor on his body vanished, but he didn’t see his true appearance.

Almost at the same time, a white armor enveloped his body. A red cape fluttered in the wind as he held a huge sword behind him, crossed with a Gatling.

Although it only took an instant for the figure to rush into the maze, Zhou Wen knew very well who the figure belonged to.

How could it be him!?Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.

The figure was clearly An Tianzuo. Apart from him, no one had such strange armor or weapons. It looked like a soul or Guardian, but it was neither.

Xiao’s Guardian armor had already been detonated by Holy God, but when he saw the Guardian armor and An Tianzuo’s figure, Holy God immediately seemed to understand something. His expression changed drastically as his figure flashed. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Xiao’s Guardian had fused with his avatar. The moment the Guardian was teleported away, he had already sensed its location. It was actually in the Holy Land, where Xiao lived. It was also the residence of the Saints.

Boom!

When Holy God arrived, the Guardian armor had already exploded. Energy was blooming like fireworks.

Holy God stood in Xiao’s room and saw the imprisoned Xiao enveloped by the exploded Guardian armor. His body was instantly destroyed by the immense energy impact of the Guardian armor. The flesh and blood on his skin rapidly melted away in the explosion.

Holy God’s eyes narrowed as time seemed to freeze. The fragments on the ground and bed that had been blasted apart froze in midair.

Holy God walked in front of Xiao, who was undergoing the explosion. He reached out and pressed his hand on the Guardian armor that was exploding. Then, with a casual flick of his hand, the Guardian armor, along with all the energy produced by the explosion, were thrown into the void.

Boom!

In the void, a terrifying explosion was like the final brilliance of a supernova-destruction, illuminating the void for an instant.

Holy God looked at Xiao, who was no longer in human shape. Instead, he looked like a bloody person that had been skinned. A trace of anger couldn’t help but flash in his eyes.

He hadn’t discovered that Xiao was being impersonated by An Tianzuo and had been screwed over. Thankfully, he had rushed over in time at the final moment. Otherwise, not only would Xiao have died, but all the Saints here would have died with him.

Holy God knew very well that the Guardian was Xiao’s to begin with. The imprisoned Xiao had definitely been trying to summon his Guardian back. Therefore, An Tianzuo could use Xiao to transfer the Guardian back. Otherwise, no matter how capable he was, it would be impossible for him to teleport the Guardian that was about to explode.

The unskinned Xiao, who was covered in blood, squirmed like a worm. The strange sounds coming from his ruptured throat weren’t just filled with pain, but also infinite hatred.

An Tianzuo sure taught me a lesson.?Holy God glanced at Xiao, who was curled up on the ground like a worm as he constantly convulsed in pain. His eyes gradually calmed down.

Xiao—who had seemed to have a layer of himself shaved off—was like a skeleton that was covered in blood and chunks of flesh. The pain he felt was unimaginable to humans.

“Do you want revenge?” Holy God asked as he looked at Xiao, who was enduring inhuman pain.

Xiao’s neck was also mangled. His throat had already ruptured, preventing him from making a sound. He desperately opened his mouth, but no sound came out.

“Are you afraid of death?” Holy God asked again.

Xiao’s mangled and trembling body tried his best to shake his head. However, his head was trembling terribly. It was difficult to even shake it. Just moving made his entire body ache to the core. Even so, he shook his head with all his might.

If not for Holy God’s fast reaction and unimaginable abilities that were beyond human imagination, he would have been a dead person.

“Then hand your life to me. Only then can you obtain the power to kill your enemy..” Holy God extended his hand in front of Xiao.
