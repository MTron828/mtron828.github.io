Chapter 1614 One Against Three

Xiao, Jiuyang, and Old K had already displayed their powerful strength. Even existences as powerful as Immortal and Ya couldn’t gain any advantage. They were suppressed.

Xiao even thrashed Thief Sage Liu Yun. If the three of them had jointly attacked Zhou Wen previously, people wouldn’t have had a straightforward idea of how strong they were. However, now that there was a comparison, the spectators were alarmed when the three of them attacked Zhou Wen. They couldn’t help but worry for him.

“Zhou Wen, you have to pay the price for everything you’ve done.” Old K stared coldly at Zhou Wen as the scepter in his hand emitted an invisible strange fluctuation.

Now that Liu Yun had escaped, it was unlikely he could return. Without the Taiji Symbol’s suppression, Old K and Xiao’s domain powers could restrain Zhou Wen again.

“When did I say I was running?” Zhou Wen said indifferently. He had no intention of running to begin with. Otherwise, he would have run with Liu Yun.

As Zhou Wen spoke, the Void Salamander lunged over again. However, this time, it didn’t return to the cosmos to recover. Its strength had been greatly suppressed by Earth’s rules, and could hardly maintain its Hell-level strength.

The void lightning descended as it crazily struck the Chaos Egg. The Void Salamander opened its mouth in a bid to devour Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen didn’t dodge and allowed the Chaos Egg to be devoured by the Void Salamander.

As the void lightning was too intense, the people watching the livestream only saw the lightning drown Zhou Wen. They didn’t know what was happening inside. However, Old K and company could clearly see that after the Void Salamander devoured Zhou Wen, a saber beam seeped out of its body. It went from its head to its tail as though it had been sliced open from the middle.

The Void Salamander’s lightning body split into two, revealing Zhou Wen, who was wearing the Dragon King armor and holding the Bamboo Blade. As for the Void Salamander’s lightning body, it quickly dissipated, leaving nothing behind.

Only then did the people watching the live broadcast clearly see Zhou Wen’s figure floating in the air. Without the Chaos Egg’s protection and the intense light of the void lightning, everyone could clearly see him. “Deceit King!”

“Holy sh*t, so Egg Sovereign is Deceit King!”

Everyone immediately recognized Zhou Wen in the Limitless Demon Dragon King armor. Zhou Wen wore the Prisoned Dragon armor as Human Sovereign, and the Limitless Demon Dragon King armor as Deceit King.

The Limitless Demon Dragon King armor had a benefit-it could combine the nine into one. Apart from Zhou Wen himself, Zhou Wen could still borrow the power of eight creatures after putting on the Limitless Demon Dragon King armor.

Now, Zhou Wen had already imprinted the Limitless Demon Dragon King’s mark on eight Companion Beasts. The eight Companion Beast tattoos were shimmering.

However, due to the Dragon King armor’s cover, people couldn’t see the shimmering Companion Beast tattoos. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Soul Mirror, Golden Wyrm Scissors, Truth Listener, and other Companion Beasts… as well as Demonic Neonate’s tattoo shimmered with a demonic glow.

Demonic Neonate finally woke up again and returned to Zhou Wen. Furthermore, she had reached the Terror grade.

The power of the eight Companion Beasts had already fused with Zhou Wen’s body. Zhou Wen could freely use all their strength for himself.

Among the eight Companion Beasts, Truth Listener contributed the most. Following that were the Golden Wyrm Scissors and the Terror-grade Demonic Neonate. Furthermore, among the eight Companion Beasts, only Demonic Neonate wasn’t at the Calamity grade.

Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade as the black crystal-like Dragon King armor emitted a strange black glow. It flickered like flames, sucking all light that approached it.

“I knew it. How could there be so many human experts? So it’s Deceit King. It’s no wonder he’s so good at spatial powers.”

“Deceit King’s Companion Beast is even more impressive than himself!”

“That’s not right. Didn’t Deceit King fight Ya and Immortal? They were actually fellow disciples?”

“This world is so complicated!”

“Even if he’s Deceit King, it’s very dangerous to face the three Saints. Why did he unsummon the Void Salamander?”

“I think Deceit King isn’t as strong as his Companion Beasts, right?”

“That’s right. The Void Salamander and Tiger Soul General are practically invincible. Quickly summon them. They should be able to fight the three Saints. There might even be a chance of defeating them.”

Everyone hoped that Zhou Wen could summon the Void Salamander and Tiger Soul General. Zhou Wen wanted to summon them, but it was impossible.

The Tiger Soul General needed time to grow powerful. It wasn’t suitable for the present situation, so summoning it was useless.

The Void Salamander wasn’t his Companion Beast at all, and he had already killed it. However, Zhou Wen hadn’t hatched the Human Realm Void Salamander Companion Egg. Even if he hatched it, it wouldn’t be of much use in a battle of this level.

Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade in hand as his Essence Energy was extremely converged. He stood on the ruins of the teleportation nexus and said to Old K and company, “Didn’t you want to kill me? Bring it on.”

“I’ll fight you,” Jiuyang said as he walked towards Zhou Wen. “Jiuyang, wait. Now isn’t the time to be a hero. The teleportation nexus has been destroyed. Lord Holy God must be furious. We have to kill him. We mustn’t allow any other variabilities.” As Old K spoke, he called out to Xiao. “Xiao, let’s attack together. We definitely can’t let him escape again.” Xiao nodded and surrounded Zhou Wen with Old K. He was puzzled. Zhou Wen clearly had a chance to leave with Liu Yun, so why didn’t he?

What are you trying to do? Xiao was puzzled, but he had no choice but to participate in this battle with Zhou Wen. He had to maintain his identity in the Holy Land and he couldn’t allow himself to be exposed.

Under such circumstances, it was impossible for Xiao to secretly help Zhou Wen. If he made any abnormal movements, Holy God would definitely notice.

Jiuyang threw a punch at Zhou Wen. His punch was like a scorching sun in the sky, as though it wanted to melt everything. With a thought, Zhou Wen unsheathed the Bamboo Blade in his hand and seemed to fuse with it. His body followed a strange arc as he slashed at Jiuyang.

If Jiuyang was a blazing sun that could incinerate everything, Zhou Wen was an immortal that had ascended in broad daylight. His strike didn’t look fast, but it was elegant as though it was untainted by the mortal world.

The saber didn’t look fast, but it dodged Jiuyang’s fist. The blade traced an arc and slashed at Jiuyang’s throat.

Jiuyang was slightly taken aback. It was clearly a strike that was light and didn’t seem to use much strength, but it made him feel like he couldn’t block or dodge. All he could do was take a step back and make way for the Bamboo Blade.

Old K and Xiao attacked from both sides, surrounding Zhou Wen from different angles.

“Holy sh*t, he still hasn’t summoned the Void Salamander and the Tiger Soul General. Could it be that Egg Sovereign… No… Deceit King really wants to rely on that saber to fight the three Saints?”

Seeing that Zhou Wen hadn’t summoned his Companion Beasts, the spectators were alarmed. Even the top experts of the various factions were no exception.
