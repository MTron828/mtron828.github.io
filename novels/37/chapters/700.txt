Chapter 701: Light Beast’s Challenge

Translator: CKtalon

All the major factions who wanted to vie for first place mobilized their forces to study what kind of Companion Beast the Origin Realm King was, as well as its various abilities.

Without a doubt, the Origin Realm King’s most terrifying ability was invisibility. Even Primordial Sword Immortal couldn’t find it. This was an extremely terrifying ability.

In addition, it was also probably very fast. Otherwise, even if it was invisible, it would be difficult for it to dodge Primordial Sword Immortal’s high-speed sword beams.

Based on these two points, professionals began to study and analyze various possibilities.

Everyone was constantly paying attention to the rankings. As there were less than 72 hours left, there was a chance that someone could challenge the Origin Realm King at any time.

In fact, other than first place, there were already many people with lower rankings challenging those with higher rankings. They hoped to obtain a better spot before the ranking matches ended.

In the final 72 hours, there was only an hour to accept the challenge. If one didn’t accept the challenge within the hour, they would automatically be declared the loser.

Zhou Wen was also studying Origin Realm King. After watching the battle between Origin Realm King and Primordial Sword Immortal, he had a nagging feeling that something was amiss.

After getting the video to watch carefully, he still failed to see any problems.

Origin Realm King’s invisibility ability could be said to be perfect. He couldn’t find any flaws. No matter how strong Primordial Sword Immortal was, no matter how strong he was, it was useless against an enemy who could casually appear beside him.

All Companion Beasts have their weaknesses. Is the invisibility ability of the Origin Realm King really that perfect? Zhou Wen didn’t believe in absolute perfection.

Just like Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World, such a powerful skill could be nullified with just a mirror.

Origin Realm King’s invisibility was indeed very powerful, but Zhou Wen felt that it definitely had a weakness. It was just that he hadn’t discovered it yet.

Just as the various factions were nervously studying it, a Companion Beast named Light Beast suddenly challenged the first-ranked Origin Realm King.

“Light beast? Isn’t that a Companion Beast of the Family Clan of Gods? I heard that it has the power of light, but its combat strength isn’t strong. At best, it’s about the level of Inferno Dragon? It’s far inferior to Primordial Sword Immortal. How can it challenge Origin Realm King?”

“Could it be that the Family Clan of Gods has found the weakness of the Origin Realm King?”

“Can Light Beast restrain Origin Realm King?”

Everyone was puzzled as they waited for the battle to begin. They wanted to know from this challenge if the Family Clan of Gods had really found the weakness of Origin Realm King or if they had other motives.

Li Xuan organized the members of the Xuanwen Club to watch the battle in front of a cube. Zhou Wen followed them to the cube. He had a nagging feeling that Origin Realm King’s invisibility wasn’t that perfect.

“Holy sh*t, don’t tell me everyone in Luoyang is here?” Li Xuan said gloomily as he looked at the crowd.

They were still a few streets away from the cube, but they were already unable to proceed forward. They could only see human heads bobbing about. They couldn’t see the cube at all. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“That’s not surprising. The various Companion Beasts that appeared before, including Primordial Sword Immortal, might be very powerful, but they could at least be clearly seen. However, this Origin Realm King is completely different. You can’t even see it. The unknown has a fatal attraction to human curiosity. Everyone wants to know what kind of Companion Beast Origin Realm King is,” Li Weiyang said.

“At this distance, we can’t see a thing. We might as well stay at home and watch from our phones.” It was rare for Huang Ji to join them. He was actually very interested in the abilities of various Companion Beasts, so he participated in the Xuanwen Club’s excursion.

Of course, he mainly wanted to reproduce the data and abilities of these Companion Beasts in-game.

After the ranking battles began, Huang Ji had been analyzing the abilities of the Companion Beasts. He planned on using them as prototypes to create some game bosses.

“If there’s really no other way, let’s find a quiet restaurant and watch the livestream,” Gulli suggested. He felt that watching the livestream was no different from watching from the cube’s screen.

Zhou Wen also felt that they were too far away. Even Truth Listener couldn’t reach such a distance, but they couldn’t barge through the crowd.

Li Xuan’s heart suddenly stirred as he said to the silent Gu Dian who was at the rear, “Old Gu, walk ahead of us.”

Zhou Wen and company’s eyes lit up as they knew what Li Xuan was thinking. They hurriedly made way for Gu Dian to take the lead.

“Stop squeezing! You... Ah...” A fierce-looking man felt that someone was trying to squeeze past him. He opened his mouth and wanted to curse, but just as he did so, he turned his gaze over. When he saw the person, his legs trembled in fear and he nearly fell to the ground. He hurriedly shut his mouth and retreated in fear.

He looked fierce himself, but when he saw the person squeezing through, he was so frightened that his heart pounded and cold sweat broke out on his back.

He had never seen such a ferocious person in his entire life. He was very worried that the other party would directly stab him to death. Therefore, he kept retreating, forcing out some space to make way for the person.

Gu Dian ignored him and continued walking forward.

Zhou Wen and company lined up and followed closely behind Gu Dian. For some reason, they felt the thrill of cutting through a line that spanned several streets.

The streets were extremely crowded. Everyone wanted to squeeze in, but no one was willing to give in. There were even quite a number of people who had verbal disputes.

However, Gu Dian successfully passed through the crowd. It didn’t look difficult at all.

Before long, Zhou Wen and company arrived at a suitable distance. It was equivalent to the best seats in a theater—around the sixth or seventh row. They waited for Origin Realm King to accept the challenge.

As it only had an hour to accept the challenge, and it took Zhou Wen and company quite a bit of time to rush over, there were less than ten minutes left. Yet, Origin Realm King still hadn’t accepted the challenge.

“It can’t be. Origin Realm King hasn’t accepted the challenge? Could it be that Light Beast is really its nemesis?”

“It’s really possible. Under the light, darkness has nowhere to hide. Perhaps it’s really the nemesis of invisibility?”

“No matter how great a nemesis it is, Origin Realm King is an existence that can fight Primordial Sword Immortal. It would be odd if Light Beast could have an effect on it.”

As people were arguing, they saw the name on the arena flash. Origin Realm King had accepted the challenge, but they didn’t see its figure.

Everyone knew that Origin Realm King had already appeared in the arena, but they just couldn’t see it.

Light Beast clearly knew this, so it didn’t hesitate to launch an attack. Light emitted from its body like a sun, illuminating the entire arena. This was its Wheel of Destiny’s power, Light Ray.
