Chapter 1560: Beginningless Sword Domain

Translator: CKtalon

Due to Sword Pill’s explosion, there was too much matter that was in a state of superposition of intangibility and corporeality. It magnified the sensations Zhou Wen experienced by a thousand times, causing his body and mind to be affected.

Zhou Wen clearly sensed the existence of the smoke. No, it shouldn’t be said that it was smoke, but a type of particle. A particle that Zhou Wen had never seen before. The characteristics of this particle were very strange. It had two sides like Yin and Yang. When it switched to Yang, it would exhibit the characteristics of a corporeal object. And when it switched to Yin, it would exhibit the characteristics of an intangible object.

Zhou Wen could only previously sense its Yang aspects, but not the Yin aspect. He finally sensed the Yin aspect due to the intense effects of Sword Pill’s explosion.

Instantly, every sensation Zhou Wen experienced seemed somewhat different. The smoke that he believed had vanished hadn’t really vanished. It had only switched to Yin. The particles still existed; Zhou Wen just couldn’t see them.

If I treat these particles as sword pills, then…?With a thought, all the particles that separated from Zhou Wen’s body instantly switched from Yin to Yang and appeared again, filling the holes in Zhou Wen’s body.

Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. The particles were like countless Sword Pills that welcomed the invading sword aura as he wished.

Zhou Wen didn’t know if this was considered finding success through failure. In fact, it wasn’t just Sword Pill. Even his body had undergone changes.

Under the effects of the countless Sword Pill particles that were in a superposition of corporeality and intangibility, Zhou Wen’s body seemed to change, heading in this direction. The particles that formed his body seemed to be transforming into a superposition of particles.

The infinite Sword Pill particles constantly resisted the sword aura, but the sword aura was just too powerful. The Sword Pill particles were constantly destroyed.

However, Zhou Wen realized that the Sword Pill particles hadn’t really been destroyed. They only appeared to be destroyed. In fact, they had only switched to Yin. With a thought from Zhou Wen, the Sword Pill particles would switch again, turning into a corporeal sword aura.

Therefore, even if the Sword Pill particles weren’t the sword aura’s match, they still managed to stall for time. It gave Zhou Wen a chance at survival.

When Zhou Wen’s body completely transformed into the Sword Pill particles that were in a superposition, a strange sword intent rose from his body. Zhou Wen’s body vanished instantly.

Only the ancient sword that had penetrated his body as well as the sword aura remained in place. Zhou Wen’s body appeared elsewhere as sword intent surged from his body.

Buzz!

The swords that had been affected by the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords fell to the ground one by one, producing a humming sound as though they were worshiping Zhou Wen.

Only a few Calamity-grade ancient swords remained flying.

As for the other swords, the influence of the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords prevented them from getting up again.

Only the ancient sword that fought Zhou Wen remained levitated, but it didn’t attack again. It only faced Zhou Wen as though it was hesitating.

Zhou Wen waved his hand at the distant Son of Heaven’s Three Swords. It seemed extremely unwilling, but under the pressure of the sword intent, it had no choice but to return to Zhou Wen’s hand.

This was the first time Zhou Wen had held the unsheathed Son of Heaven’s Three Swords. He already understood why he couldn’t unsheathe it.

If the Son of Heaven fought, corpses would be strewn for miles. There was no need for him to draw his sword. If there came a day when the Son of Heaven drew his sword, the only use was probably for him to commit suicide.

This didn’t mean that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords could only be used for suicide. Its effects weren’t in combat but on the psyche.

Therefore, despite the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords being only at the Terror grade, it could affect the powerful ancient sword. This didn’t mean that it was stronger than the ancient sword, but because it was the sword of the Son of Heaven.

The Son of Heaven didn’t necessarily have very powerful martial strength, but he could commandeer generals with invincible combat strength.

When Zhou Wen held the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords, sword intent emitted from it. The extremely terrifying sword intent on his body instantly elevated.

The Calamity-grade ancient swords that could still fly also landed on the ground one by one. Although they weren’t trembling, they no longer showed their original arrogance.

Only the ancient sword that fought Zhou Wen remained floating.

Zhou Wen faced it with his sword as he walked towards it step by step. The ancient sword suddenly emitted a sword hum as it transformed into a sword beam that flew away and returned to the grave.

With the sword hum emitted by the ancient sword, the other ancient swords flew away and returned to their respective graves.

Even the Son of Heaven has things he can’t obtain. Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed as he looked at the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords in his hand and sheathed it.

He tried pulling it out again. This time, it was very easy to pull it out. It wasn’t like before.

“Didn’t you disallow me to unsheathe you? Ain’t I unsheathing you now? Ha!” Zhou Wen sheathed and unsheathed it repeatedly to vent his former frustrations of not being able to unsheathe the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords.

Every time Zhou Wen unsheathed the Son of Heaven’s Sword, the swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb would hum. After sheathing it, the sword hum would stop as though they were remote-controlled.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to kill the swords. He looked at the blood-colored avatar’s information, and indeed, the Qi Refinement Art had a Calamity Zone.

Calamity Zone: Beginningless Sword Domain (Human Realm)

This works.?Although this was somewhat different from what Zhou Wen had imagined, it wasn’t a bad choice.

As the saying went, man proposes, God disposes. There weren’t many things in life that completely followed a predetermined trajectory. Perhaps the Beginningless Sword Domain wasn’t what Zhou Wen wanted, but it wasn’t something he didn’t want. This was already a very good outcome.

Show me how strong this Beginningless Sword Domain is.?Zhou Wen activated the Sword Domain as the ancient swords within the Sword Domain flew out of their graves.

Countless threads of sword aura appeared out of thin air, destroying the swords in the vicinity. One of the Calamity-grade ancient swords emitted a terrifying sword beam, hoping to fight the sword aura.

Under the impact of the infinite sword aura that resembled a galaxy, the sword shattered and a Companion Egg dropped.

For a moment, there was no complete sword in the Sword Domain. There were only dimensional crystals shimmering on the ground.

Even the Calamity-grade ancient sword seemed to lose the courage to resist when Zhou Wen unsheathed the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords. It could only allow Zhou Wen to attack without daring to retaliate. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Only the ancient sword that had fought Zhou Wen remained unmoved.
