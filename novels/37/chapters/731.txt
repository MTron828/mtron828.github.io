Chapter 732: Disappeared

Smash my phone? It’s probably not of much use. It could silently run from the television into my phone, so it should be able to move elsewhere. That would make it even harder to find it. Now that it’s in my phone, at least I know where it is, Zhou Wen thought to himself.

What kind of dimensional creature is this? A pure electric creature? Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to monitor it and could only sense electric waves. He couldn’t tell anything else.

Zhou Wen thought about it carefully. The electric-elemental creatures he had heard of in the past had powerful destructive powers. They were especially ferocious when it came to roasting meat.

However, this was the first time Zhou Wen had seen an electric-type creature that could enter electronic products, control electronic products, and use his software to send messages. He had never even heard of it before, much less seen it.

If it was a traditional electric-type creature, Zhou Wen could blast it apart even if it was at the Mythical stage.

However, such a sneaky fellow was not easy to deal with.

Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss for a good solution. He wanted to use his phone to contact The Thearch to ask if she knew the origins of this strange electric-type creature, but he was afraid that the information would be tampered with. He didn’t know what trouble it would cause.

After daybreak, Zhou Wen carried the wooden log to the phone shop. There were very few people in the small city. After circling the city for some time, he finally found a phone shop and bought a few new phones and a new SIM card.

After returning to the hotel, Zhou Wen placed the new phones in front of him and used Truth Listener to monitor the internal electric current in them.

Only his first phone had a strange electric current fluctuation. Zhou Wen left it on the table and took out a new phone. He went to the yard outside and called The Thearch.

Thankfully, The Thearch didn’t reject the call because it was an unknown number. Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief and recounted what he had encountered in detail.

“To think I’ve never seen such a dimensional creature before.” The Thearch actually didn’t know the origins of this dimensional creature.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

After pausing for a moment, The Thearch continued, “However, from your description, it should have an electromagnetic attribute. It might even have a magnetic field ability. It’s probably impossible to destroy it by simply destroying the phone. It can easily transfer elsewhere.”

“That’s what I think too. I just can’t think of a good way to deal with it,” Zhou Wen said.

The Thearch curled her lips and said, “Were your studies for nothing? Waves need to be transmitted through matter, and particles will be affected by a force field. Even if it’s formed from pure electric energy, it can’t break these laws. Why don’t you try using the power similar to a black hole created by Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength?”

Zhou Wen was immediately taken aback. He had been considering how to restrain the electric-type creatures that existed in myths and legends. He never expected that a dimensional creature like The Thearch would take to him using human scientific knowledge.

“How do you know that Tyrant Behemoth is mine?” Zhou Wen suddenly reacted. He hadn’t told The Thearch that Tyrant Behemoth belonged to him.

“What do I not know?” The Thearch said disdainfully.

After hanging up, Zhou Wen returned to his room. Just as he was about to test if Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength was effective, he suddenly realized that the special electric current in his phone had vanished.

Zhou Wen carefully checked the other phones and checked everything in the hotel that could be connected to electricity. He didn’t discover any abnormal electric waves.

Why is it gone now? Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and thought of a possibility.

It was very likely that the strange electric creature had overheard his conversation with The Thearch and had escaped.

Unwilling to give up, he searched the entire night without discovering any problems. In the day, Zhou Wen had no choice but to set off.

After this, nothing abnormal happened on the phone. Everything returned to normal.

Has that electric-type creature really escaped? Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that such a strange and cunning dimensional creature would be frightened away by a few words.

Not long after Zhou Wen left, three men entered the small city where he had stayed. The three of them looked haggard and they had dark eye circles. They looked like they had stayed up all night for a week and were about to die.

These three people were naturally Xia Liuchuan, Zhang Chunqiu, and Dugu Ge.

“Don’t you think that there’s something wrong with this matter? The first time we encountered that terrifying electric beast, we were nearly electrocuted to death. The second time, we encountered a Nightmare and almost lost ourselves in a dreamland forever. Why did we encounter such powerful Mythical creatures?” Xia Liuchuan said.

Dugu Ge said with certainty, “It’s definitely not a coincidence.”

Zhang Chunqiu pondered for a moment and said, “I think this matter might have something to do with Zhou Wen. Wherever he goes, nothing happens. But he leaves a wake of problems behind him.”

“Are you saying that Zhou Wen is secretly up to no good and wants to harm us?” Xia Liuchuan frowned.

“That’s not it. He probably doesn’t know that we are here. After all, it was a coincidence that we met him previously,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“Then what do you mean?” Xia Liuchuan looked at Zhang Chunqiu in confusion.

Zhang Chunqiu pondered for a moment and said, “Did you notice that there’s something wrong with the piece of wood Zhou Wen has been carrying?”

“Of course there’s a problem. I’ve never seen such a block of wood before. It looks a little like a Gloomy Wood, but it looks even more solid than the Gloomy Wood,” Xia Liuchuan said.

“No, I’m not talking about that.” Zhang Chunqiu reorganized his thoughts before saying, “Do you feel that the log is a little sinister?”

“Sinister?” Xia Liuchuan and Dugu Ge exchanged looks, puzzled.

Seeing that they were silent, Zhang Chunqiu guessed that they had not noticed it before. He continued, “I think there’s something wrong with that piece of wood. It seems a little sinister. It doesn’t feel like a simple log.”

“If it doesn’t look like a log, what does it look like?” Xia Liuchuan asked in confusion.

“How should I put it? Nowadays, we carry out cremation or promession. In ancient times, land burials were popular. It used a wooden coffin to store a person’s corpse before burying it in the ground. Although that piece of wood looks different from a coffin, the sinister aura emitted from it makes me think of a coffin.” Zhang Chunqiu shared his feelings.

“A coffin? Are you saying that there might be a dead person’s corpse in that piece of wood? Zhou Wen is traveling with a dead person’s corpse on his back? Why is he carrying that thing?” Xia Liuchuan widened his eyes.
