Chapter 1036: Cold-Faced Hades

Translator: CKtalon

“Surrender?” Countless question marks appeared over Yu Guang’s head.

As for Shen Yuchi and the bureau’s top brass who were watching everything through the surveillance cameras, their expressions turned very strange.

At this moment, only an idiot would believe Zhou Wen when he said that he wanted to surrender. If he really wanted to surrender, he should have come a long time ago. Why would he wait until now?

“Director-General, what should we do?” Yu Guang whispered to Shen Yuchi through the communicator.

“Director-General, you mustn’t let Zhou Wen in. This must be his scheme to overthrow our bureau,” a director immediately warned.

“That’s right. That Zhou Wen can’t enter Sky Pass, so he’s trying to use such a method to sneak in. He definitely wants to kill us. We definitely can’t let him in.”

“Director-General, Zhou Wen is Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. We have to be wary!”

The bureau’s brass were surprisingly unanimous. They definitely couldn’t let Zhou Wen in.

The average person might not know how terrifying Zhou Wen was, but what kind of place was the bureau? This was where the ears and eyes of the Federation were. They knew Zhou Wen better than anyone else.

It could be said that Zhou Wen’s file was ranked one of the highest in the Federation. It was ranked alongside Jing Daoxian, Wang Mingyuan, and a few others. Even the Federation’s Senators’ files weren’t as confidential as Zhou Wen’s.

They knew very well how terrifying Zhou Wen was. The information they had obtained from their investigations was shocking. Anyone who had read the information would no longer treat him as an undergraduate unless they had a screw loose.

Shen Yuchi was naturally the one in the bureau with the deepest understanding of Zhou Wen, so he felt a headache coming on.

Shen Yuchi naturally didn’t believe a word of Zhou Wen’s claims of surrendering. However, Zhou Wen had already come to the bureau. Would he leave so easily?

“Put him at ease first. Find out what he wants.” Shen Yuchi ordered Yu Guang. He knew that escaping was definitely not a solution. He had to think of a way to resolve the problem.

Tang Zhizhong was at a loss and didn’t know what to do.

Zhou Wen was actually a wanted criminal of the bureau. Furthermore, he had a screw loose and wanted to surrender.

Everyone knew that the bureau was unreasonable. As long as one’s brain wasn’t damaged, they wouldn’t turn themselves in. Even if they felt bad and chose to commit suicide to atone for their sins, they wouldn’t turn themselves in.

It’s over, it’s over. I actually believed the words of a lunatic and even got someone to send the space suits over. Isn’t this asking for trouble? Tang Zhizhong was already a little afraid.

The bureau had already made up its mind to break the contract. If they found an excuse to arrest him along with this lunatic, he might lose his life, much less money.

Just as Tang Zhizhong was feeling alarmed, he heard Yu Guang speak from the top of the city gates.

Tang Zhizhong was no stranger to Yu Guang. He was one of the four Censors of the bureau. Apart from Cai Jin who had died previously, he was the most senior.

Furthermore, Yu Guang was the head of the General Affairs Department. All sorts of matters in the bureau needed to go through him.

The matter of the space suits also had to go through Yu Guang, only he was only responsible for the final decision. There were still plenty of officers under him, so Tang Zhizhong had had no chance to personally discuss this matter with Yu Guang.

Previously, he had come here a few times wanting to meet Yu Guang to clarify the matter about the space suit. However, Yu Guang wouldn’t see him at all and only let Tang Zhizhong talk to the officers under him.

Yu Guang also had another nickname, Cold-faced Hades. From this nickname, one could tell what kind of person he usually was.

“I’m afraid there’s been a misunderstanding. Our bureau has never had a warrant for you, and you aren’t a criminal.” He paused for a moment before saying, “I’ve heard some things about you. You are a good student with excellent grades and morals. You are humble and sincere. You have contributed a lot to our Federation, so why is there a need for you to surrender?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Tang Zhizhong listened to Yu Guang and then looked at the kind face Yu Guang was wearing. He almost thought that he had recognized the wrong person.

Is this really the Cold-faced Hades, Yu Guang? Tang Zhizhong sized up Yu Guang again and again to confirm that he had not misidentified him. It was Cold-faced Hades, Yu Guang. There was no mistake about that.

“There’s no misunderstanding. I’m guilty. I feel bad and wish to redeem myself,” Zhou Wen said with a serious expression.

“See that? This fellow is just looking for trouble. He wants to enter Sky Pass and kill us. We definitely can’t let him in,” a director shouted from the office.

“Yu Guang, figure out his intentions first.” Shen Yuchi frowned slightly, but he didn’t panic.

The world’s number one pass wasn’t an empty title. No matter how strong Zhou Wen was, it was impossible for him to forcefully enter Sky Pass.

It’s over, it’s over. It wasn’t easy for Cold-faced Hades to show kindness and say something humane. Yet, this punk actually wants to court death! Tang Zhizhong’s expression was ashen. He felt Yu Guang definitely wouldn’t let Zhou Wen off after what he said. He would capture him first before deciding if he was guilty or not.

However, to his surprise, Yu Guang turned even friendlier. His smile became even more amiable. “The Special Investigation Bureau isn’t a law-enforcement organization. If you really want to surrender yourself, you should go to the police station. However, I know your character. You are a promising youth and a future pillar of the Federation. You’re not the kind of person to commit crimes. Did you encounter any difficulties? If you have any difficulties, tell us. The Special Investigation Bureau is a ministry under the Federation. We have the obligation to resolve the problems for federal citizens...”

Tang Zhizhong listened in a daze and felt that he was dreaming.

The bureau isn’t a law-enforcement agency? It is obligated to help federal citizens resolve their problems? Is this still the bureau I know? Is this still the Cold-faced Hades I know? Tang Zhizhong suddenly realized that the young man in front of him might not be a lunatic.

Just as Yu Guang was trying his best to persuade Zhou Wen, trucks quickly drove over from afar. It was Tang Zhizhong’s company delivering the space suits over.

The trucks drove very quickly and soon, a row of trucks had stopped not far from Tang Zhizhong.

A middle-aged man jumped out of the truck eagerly. As he ran to Tang Zhizhong, he asked loudly, “Old Tang, what’s the situation? Is the bureau willing to take receipt of this batch of goods? After you gave the instructions, I delivered the goods here as quickly as possible. How do we do the handover?”

“No, the bureau didn’t agree to take receipt of our goods,” Tang Zhizhong said.

“They didn’t agree to take receipt of them? Then why did you get us to deliver the goods here?” Many of the factory employees got out of the trucks and surrounded Tang Zhizhong, looking at him eagerly.

They were all hoping that they would be paid after the goods were accepted. They needed to support their families.

“This Mr. Zhou said that he can get the bureau to take receipt for us,” Tang Zhizhong said with a complicated expression as he pointed at Zhou Wen.

“He’s from the bureau?” Everyone looked at Zhou Wen. They found it unbelievable when they saw how young he was.

“No... No... He’s a criminal who wants to surrender...” When Tang Zhizhong spoke, his expression became even stranger.
