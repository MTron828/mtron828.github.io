Chapter 1095: Darkness Domain Devil

Translator: CKtalon

Boom! Boom!

Terrifying footsteps sounded from the Door of Darkness. Every step seemed to shake the void.

Seeing a black figure walk out of the door, Zhou Wen retracted his Night Immaculate Sword and didn’t continue attacking Zhou Ming because it was too late. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Through the cube, people gradually saw the creature that came out of the door. It was a monster that seemed to be enveloped by darkness. Its indistinct figure in the darkness was like a huge minotaur.

With its huge bull’s horn, arrow-shaped tail, and legs with reverse joints it walked out of the Door of Darkness step by step and landed in the arena. The entire arena seemed to be enveloped by the terrifying dark aura.

Unlike Night Thearch’s Evernight powers, the dark aura didn’t block out the light. One could still see the monster’s faintly discernible figure, but this feeling made one feel even more terrified.

In an ancient temple on a plateau, an old man played with a Demonfall Pestle as he looked at the cube screen beside him. When he saw the dark minotaur appear, he couldn’t help but frown slightly. Using Darkness Emissary’s Door of Darkness, he summoned the top Terror-grade creature, Dark Domain Devil, into the arena. He bypassed the suppression of Earth’s rules and allowed the Dark Domain Devil to maintain its full strength after its descent. Those fellows from the dimension will really think of any method to prevent humans from obtaining first place.

However, will Dark Domain Devil really fulfill their wish? Jing Daoxian looked at Zhou Wen, who was on the other side of the arena. His eyes shimmered with a strange glint as he fiddled with the Demonfall Pestle and muttered to himself, “Let me see how far you have come.”

“How shameless. Such a creature isn’t something a fellow like Zhou Ming can summon. It must be those fellows from the dimension,” Li Xuan said angrily.

Wang Lu hugged Ya’er and said, “The cube is the home ground of dimensional creatures to begin with. If you want to win in such an environment, you have to be prepared to fight in adversarial situations.”

Feng Qiuyan also said, “What I’m most worried about isn’t this Terror creature. I’m afraid that Coach will be like Ya and be kicked out by them using the cube’s rules. He won’t even have a chance to fight.”

“Those shameless fellows will definitely do such a thing.” Li Xuan agreed with Feng Qiuyan’s point of view.

Others might not recognize Zhou Wen, but they knew him too well. They had already recognized him from his Companion Beasts, so they were somewhat worried.

“Don’t worry. Zhou Wen won’t be kicked out so easily,” Wei Ge said with narrowed eyes.

He had come to the Wang family residence to pass on Zhou Wen’s message to Li Xuan and company. When he saw Zhou Wen enter the arena, he stayed behind to watch the battle.

“Old Zhou has many strange abilities, but this is their home ground after all. The rules were set by them... It’s not easy...” Li Xuan felt his balls ache just thinking about it. It was clearly a battle that decided the King of Earth, but the rules weren’t set by the creatures on Earth.

“Darkness Domain Devil, kill him!” Zhou Ming pointed at Zhou Wen excitedly.

Although he hadn’t summoned Darkness Domain Devil with his own strength and had the help of the dimensional creatures, this was a chance that brought him closest to being the King of Earth.

With the power of Darkness Domain Devil, as long as he defeated this strange person in front of him, he had a high chance of obtaining the Dimensional Wheel and becoming the King of Earth.

Darkness Domain Devil ignored him and stared at Zhou Wen. Its blood-red eyes in the darkness were like a pair of huge red lanterns.

Although Darkness Domain Devil had been summoned by Zhou Ming, it wasn’t a summoned beast. It was a very famous creature in the Darkness Domain, one of the strongest Terror-grade creatures in the dimension.

If not for some reason, Darkness Domain Devil would have long advanced to the Calamity grade.

The dimensional bigwigs had secretly planned this operation. They had gotten Darkness Domain Devil to descend with the Door of Darkness Door because they hoped to settle this once and for all. They didn’t want any additional problems.

Previously, they had paid a huge price to forcefully kick Ya out of the game. Only then did the various bigwigs agree to use the cube’s nomological forces. If it happened again, ignoring the bigwigs who knew that their race had no hope of obtaining first place, just inviting those bigwigs over wouldn’t be an easy task.

“Weak creatures like humans are always capable of causing a lot of trouble. In the past, those fellows were already troublesome. I never expected these fellows to be even more troublesome now.” A mysterious shadow felt a headache coming on.

They were clearly creatures that were so weak that they couldn’t advance to the Mythical stage, but they could take advantage of every opportunity and do something that gave them a headache.

“Any last wishes? If it’s not too difficult, I can try my best to satisfy you,” Darkness Domain Devil said to Zhou Wen.

It naturally didn’t have good intentions. This was also one of its abilities. If its opponent’s will was shaken, it would make its strength even stronger.

Although its opponent was only an Earthling, Darkness Domain Devil wasn’t careless at all. It treated Zhou Wen as an opponent of the same level. It only wanted to use the safest method to kill its opponent in exchange for the benefits promised by the dimensional bigwigs.

In a battle of the same level, strength was, needless to say, important. But apart from that, the strength of a creature’s will was extremely important in battle.

“I do have a wish. It’s not too difficult. I hope you can satisfy me,” Zhou Wen said after some serious thought.

Darkness Domain Devil was slightly delighted. It thought that Zhou Wen’s will had wavered, so it asked, “Tell me, what’s your wish?”

Zhou Wen sized up Darkness Domain Devil and said in all seriousness, “Can you let me see your true body?”

Darkness Domain Devil was slightly taken aback. It never expected Zhou Wen to make such a request. It immediately knew that Zhou Wen’s will hadn’t wavered. Perhaps he was just stalling for time.

At that moment, Darkness Domain Devil didn’t waste any more time. The dark aura on its body surged like a tidal wave over the arena. Soon, it enveloped the entire cube, preventing outsiders from seeing anything.

However, the dark aura didn’t injure anyone. Instead, the blood-red eyes of Darkness Domain Devil eyes intensified, but under the envelopment of the Darkness Domain, no one could see it.

“Come, let me bring your soul into the dark abyss. Enjoy the joy of depravity!” Darkness Domain Devil approached Zhou Wen with the tide of dark aura. At the same time, the sanguine light in its eyes intensified as though it had some soul-stealing power.

Zhou Wen’s Wheel of Destiny kept circulating as he watched every move of Darkness Domain Devil. When he saw the pair of eyes, he immediately felt attracted to them as though his soul was about to be sucked in.

Thankfully, his willpower and mental strength were stronger than ordinary people. He temporarily stabilized his mind, but he pretended to be attracted by it. As though he was in a daze, he walked towards Darkness Domain Devil step by step.
