Chapter 1564: Collision

Translator: CKtalon

“What’s your name?” Zhou Wen asked the kneeling youth.

“Your Devilish Excellency, my name is Cain.” The youth looked at Zhou Wen with anticipation. There was no fear in his eyes, only adoration.

“Cain?” Zhou Wen looked at the youth in front of him in a daze. He had delicate features. Although he was still a youth, he was extremely handsome. His facial features were well-defined, and one could tell that he would grow up to be a very handsome man in the future.

“Yes, Your Devilish Excellency. My name is Cain,” the youth repeated.

It’s probably just a coincidence, Zhou Wen thought.

Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with the name Cain. In the bible, there were also people who said that he was the ancestor of evil. Others said he was the ancestor of vampires.

However, Cain was unlikely to be the son of Adam and Eve. This youth’s seniority was clearly much lower. It was impossible for him to be the son of Adam and Eve.

Furthermore, if he was really Cain, he was likely an evil person. The City Lord wouldn’t treat him as the hope of Regretless City, much less offer him the Companion Beast.

“Cain, I’ll bestow you a Companion Beast. I hope you can use it to protect your home, family, and friends. Don’t disappoint the City Lord’s expectations of you,” Zhou Wen said.

“Yes, Your Devilish Excellency. I’ll abide by your teachings.” The youth looked at Zhou Wen with admiration as he listened attentively.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to give the Golden Battle God to the City Lord. The Terror-grade Golden Battle God was also a long-range offensive Companion Beast. In the future, he would have a chance of hunting some Mythical dimensional creatures. Slowly, he might have a chance of improving the lives of the humans in Regretless City.

However, when he saw the youth and heard his name, Zhou Wen suddenly had an idea. He called Grim Demon out again.

“What do you want? Getting me to return one moment and wanting me to be out the next,” Grim Demon shouted unhappily.

“Give me a Terror-grade Ancient Snake Companion Egg.” Zhou Wen extended his hand in front of Grim Demon.

“How could I have that?” Grim Demon shook his head.

Zhou Wen stared at Grim Demon and didn’t say another word. Grim Demon forced a smile and said, “I really don’t! Don’t look at me like that. I really don’t have one. If you don’t believe me, search…”

Finally, Grim Demon took out a Terror-grade Ancient Snake Companion Egg as though it was a magic trick and placed it in Zhou Wen’s hand.

“I’m downright unlucky to have encountered you.” Grim Demon grumbled as he returned to the Demonic Sword, ignoring Zhou Wen’s subsequent calls.

Zhou Wen hatched the Ancient Snake Companion Egg and glanced at the kneeling youth before transferring it to him.

With his Epic strength, it was impossible for him to incubate a Terror-grade Companion Beast. This was the only way for him to possess a Terror-grade Companion Beast.

“Your Devilish Excellency!” The youth took in the information transmitted to him by the Ancient Snake Companion Beast. He was immediately pleasantly surprised as he looked at Zhou Wen with even more admiration.

“Good luck.” With that said, Zhou Wen turned to Liz and Leem and transferred the two Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queens to them.

“Master!” Liz and Leem were pleasantly surprised.

“Put them on and leave with me. You need their strength,” Zhou Wen said.

Liz and Leem summoned their Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queens. Armor burning with flames enveloped their bodies. Amidst the flickering flames, their petite bodies were accentuated by the armor, making them look like succubi from hell.

The City Lord and the youth looked at the two sisters in a daze as though they didn’t know them.

“Let’s go.” Zhou Wen carried Demonic Neonate and led the two sisters to the Cube.

Zhou Wen and company walked into the Cube. Under Zhou Wen’s orders, they dripped their blood and activated the Cube. They vanished, having instantly been teleported away by the Cube.

The people of Regretless City knelt in front of the Cube and worshiped it. Some even cried as they called out to the Devil King.

When he arrived at Dubhe Palace, Zhou Wen immediately looked at Liz and Leem. Seeing their armor burning with raging flames, he stored them in the chaos space straight away.

Only he stood in front of Dubhe Palace and looked at its door. The Chaos Egg around him had already appeared.

The Cubes all over the world lit up at the same time.

Everyone’s eyes were immediately attracted by this commotion. The various factions had been paying attention to the Cube’s situation. When they saw the Cube light up, people immediately began filming.

However, when they saw the scene on the Cube, they couldn’t help but be stunned.

“What’s going on?” Xia Liuchuan, who was a guest at the Zhang family residence, said with a strange expression when he saw the projection on the Cube.

Zhang Chunqiu, who was accompanying Xia Liuchuan, had a strange expression.

It wasn’t just them. Everyone in the Federation was surprised and puzzled.

On the Cube’s screen stood a person and an egg the height of a person floating in the air.

Everyone knew that person. He was Saint Jiuyang, who had previously cleared Dubhe Palace and obtained first place. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, many people didn’t know what the egg was.

Ordinary people might not know, but Zhang Chunqiu, Xia Liuchuan, and others who were more familiar with Zhou Wen recognized that the egg was Zhou Wen’s ability. Zhou Wen was undoubtedly inside.

“When did Zhou Wen mix with the Holy Land?” Xia Liuchuan said in puzzlement.

“He wouldn’t.” Zhang Chunqiu shook his head and said, “I reckon it’s a coincidence. He entered the Cube dungeon at the same time as Jiuyang.”

“Isn’t this too much of a coincidence? Furthermore, will this work?” Xia Liuchuan wasn’t sure either.

It wasn’t just Xia Liuchuan who didn’t believe it. Zhou Wen also found it unbelievable. Just as he put the sisters in and summoned the Chaos Egg, he saw a figure appear not far away.

“Isn’t it said that only four people can enter this Cube dimensional zone at a time? Why can others enter?” Zhou Wen looked at Jiuyang in puzzlement.

Jiuyang looked at Zhou Wen in equal puzzlement.

The three people who had entered with him had already turned to dust. It was impossible for anyone to be here. Furthermore, he had never seen the egg in front of him.

“Strange, why are there other creatures here?” Jiuyang frowned as he stared at the Chaos Egg.

Just as everyone was feeling puzzled, the Cube suddenly flashed. A line of words appeared: “Two groups of creatures activated the Cube at the same time. PVP mode activated.”

Zhou Wen and Jiuyang also saw the glowing words floating in the air. Although there was no deeper explanation, they could roughly guess that the two groups could fight in the dimensional zone. They might even have to kill each other.

“Chunqiu, this isn’t good. Zhou Wen was actually so unlucky to encounter Jiuyang. A place like Dubhe Palace is basically Jiuyang’s home ground. He has already cleared it once, and now he’s here again. It’s highly likely that he has the confidence to kill Starlord Ravenous Wolf and snatch first place. Zhou Wen is in trouble. I hope he doesn’t realize that it’s Zhou Wen. The Holy Land doesn’t have a good impression of Zhou Wen.. They will definitely want to kill him…” Xia Liuchuan was secretly worried for Zhou Wen.
