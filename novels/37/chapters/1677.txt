Chapter 1678 Karma Reversal Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The name of Mohe’s Life Providence was Harming Others Without Benefiting Oneself. Previously, it was famous for being a useless Life Providence. If he harmed others, not only would others not be injured, but he would also suffer the same injuries.

SOIT

This Life Providence had once made Mohe doubt life, but he didn’t sink into depression like the average person would. Instead, he regained his confidence and firmly believed that there was no crippled Life Providence in the world, only crippled people. He definitely could find a way to use his Life Providence.

However, after trying one method after another, none of them met with success.

Mohe had also thought that perhaps his Life Soul had some special attribute that could reverse the disadvantage of his Life Providence and even turn the disadvantage into an advantage.

However, it didn’t happen. His Life Soul was equally weak and he was similarly unable to harm others.

When humans finally found a way to advance to the Mythical stage, Mohe placed his hopes on the Wheel of Destiny. He thought that the Wheel of Destiny could change everything.

Likewise, it didn’t. His Wheel of Destiny was actually the same type. He still couldn’t harm anyone.

Even someone as mentally resilient as Mohe was about to break down. Although he was a member of the Family Clan of Gods, he was a cripple. He didn’t obtain many resources. He had already paid a significant price to reach the Mythical stage.

No matter how many resources his family had, it was impossible for them to help him advance to the Terror grade.

Mohe didn’t blame the family. He felt that it was fair. If it were him, he wouldn’t invest the resources on a hopeless person either.

Just as Mohe had given up hope, he never expected the dimension’s Fallen race to find him and help him advance to the Calamity grade.

When Mohe’s Life Providence advanced to the Terror grade and entered the Terror form, it finally underwent a reversal. Just as he had imagined, it turned the disadvantage into an advantage.

His Terror form was called Karma Reversal. Under the effects of the Terror form, he went from harming others without benefiting himself to harming others to benefit himself. His Life Soul and Wheel of Destiny also became extremely powerful.

When he advanced to the Calamity grade, he could finally freely control his strength and no longer be restrained by all sorts of restrictions. Not only could he injure others, but anyone who harmed him in his domain would also suffer a karma reversal, causing the enemy to be injured instead. Furthermore, this kind of injury would be reflected multiple times over.

Mohe knew his abilities very well. Even if Zhou Wen’s level was higher than his and his strength was greater than his, it was still impossible for him to defeat him. The stronger Zhou Wen was, the more miserable his defeat would be.

Bang!

Zhou Wen struck Mohe on the head. Just as Mohe was considering if he should take this opportunity to eliminate Zhou Wen, he suddenly felt his head buzz. His mind went blank as his body fell forward uncontrollably and slammed to the ground. Then, an intense pain spread throughout his body as the sound of bones shattering constantly sounded.

Mohe was slammed to the ground by Zhou Wen. As his body twisted and sank into the ground, all his bones fractured as blood seeped out of his seven orifices.

“No… Impossible…” Mohe’s irises constricted as he struggled to get up. However, he realized that his arm and leg bones had snapped into several pieces. He couldn’t control them at all. He couldn’t even move, much less stand up. The intense pain pulsed through his nerves.

On the distant ship, the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace fell dead silent. Everyone gaped as they stared blankly at Zhou Wen and Mohe, who had been slammed into the concrete ground.

For a moment, they suspected if this was the real Mohe. Perhaps this Mohe was only a replica and a weak imposter. Otherwise, how could he have been smacked to the ground by Zhou Wen and not be able to get up?

He was Mohe, the Mohe who had appeared virtually invincible on the Cube. Even a Calamity-grade dimensional creature had been casually killed by him. There was no need for him to do anything. If a Calamity creature attacked him, they would be killed by this Fallen race representative’s recoil.

If it wasn’t for the fact that Mohe had previously killed hundreds of Companion Beasts with one hand and if it wasn’t for the fact that Mohe had just defeated Sei Gasakai with one strike, they would have no doubt that he was a useless imposter.

But now, they looked at Zhou Wen with eyes filled with zeal and respect.

This was the true peak combat strength of humanity. Without becoming a representative or relying on a Guardian, his strength had reached an unbelievable level.

After casually teaching Honn Shinsakura three strikes, he allowed Honn Shinsakura to defeat Mohe in terms of sword techniques. With a casual palm strike, he slammed the invisible Mohe to the ground. How terrifying was this existence?

“Master, is he really pure human?” Even Shiraishi Satomi, who knew Zhou Wen’s identity, found it difficult to believe the truth she knew.

To be able to smack down Mohe with a single slap, how powerful was this force? Shiraishi Satomi found it difficult to believe that pure humans could reach this stage.

After all, before Zhou Wen was born, no human could advance to the Mythical stage as a pure-blooded human, much less slap a Calamity-grade existence to the ground.

“Some people are born different,” Sei Gasakai said with a sigh.

At that moment, Zhou Wen was like a god in the eyes of the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.

Zhou Wen looked at the struggling Mohe, who couldn’t stand up, and was somewhat surprised. He never expected the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power to restrain Mohe. It was even stronger than he imagined.

However, Zhou Wen soon understood the reason. He had the Hell-level Teacher Domain constantly activated. The effects of the Teacher Domain were now even stronger than before.

During the entire process of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power resisting Mohe’s power, the effects of the Teacher Domain were completely unleashed due to Mohe’s power being restrained. The Teacher Domain had already deduced the rules of Mohe’s power.

Zhou Wen already understood the rules of Mohe’s power. He couldn’t help but sigh inwardly. Mohe sure is unlucky. This power of Karma Reversal can gain the upper hand against any powerful force. However, the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s domain power is a form of sacrificial power. Human Sovereign sacrificed himself to the heavens to fulfill the wishes of others. When it’s used on him, what’s originally a saving power becomes a force of destruction thanks to his Karma Reversal powers.

It was only because Zhou Wen was just giving it a try from the beginning that he didn’t dare use all his strength. He was afraid that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power couldn’t injure Mohe and he would suffer the consequences. If he had used all his strength, he would probably have killed Mohe.

“Get someone to take him back.” Zhou Wen wasn’t a bloodthirsty person, nor was there any reason for him to kill Mohe.

If it were anyone else, they might have imagined that Mohe was an enemy and wanted to eliminate him as soon as possible. However, Zhou Wen stood at a different vantage point.

In particular, the few conversations he had had with his teacher, Wang Mingyuan, made Zhou Wen realize very clearly that his enemy wasn’t humans or these representatives, but the terrifying dimension. These representatives might become humanity’s hope and main combat strength in the future. This was also why he didn’t object to Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu becoming representatives.
