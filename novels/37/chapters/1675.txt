Chapter 1676: Same Plot

Translator: CKtalon

“His sword technique is nothing much. Unless he uses powers above the Terror grade, these three strikes should be enough for you to defeat him.” Zhou Wen threw the blade back to Honn Shinsakura.

“You don’t have to use words to taunt me. Since I’ve said that I would only use powers on the same level as him, I definitely won’t go back on my word. If I use powers above the Terror grade, it will naturally be considered a loss,” said Mohe coldly.

He didn’t believe that Honn Shinsakura could defeat him with these three strikes.

Zhou Wen declined to comment, but Honn Shinsakura suddenly bowed at him as a form of thanks. He said solemnly, “I’ll remember your kindness in imparting the Dao.”

“Go.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.

Only then did Honn Shinsakura stand up and walk towards Mohe with his blade in hand.

The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace wore odd expressions. They really couldn’t tell how the three strikes that Zhou Wen had taught were worth Honn Shinsakura’s bow.

Shiraishi Satomi also wore a puzzled expression as she looked at Sei Gasakai and asked, “Master, are Zhou Wen’s three strikes really that magical?”

She knew how proud Honn Shinsakura was. To be able to make him bow so respectfully meant that he almost treated Zhou Wen as a master. It also indirectly meant that the three strikes were definitely extraordinary. However, Shiraishi Satomi couldn’t tell how the three strikes were different from the basic sword moves she had learned in the past.

“How can a figure like Mr. Zhou spout nonsense?” Sei Gasakai couldn’t tell what was so profound about the three swords, but he could sense that Honn Shinsakura’s aura had changed.

This change didn’t seem obvious. If Honn Shinsakura hadn’t been taught by Sei Gasakai, it would have been difficult for him to notice this change.

“Please be careful of my blade.” Honn Shinsakura stopped opposite Mohe. He held the blade Zhou Wen had borrowed and didn’t summon the second short blade he often used.

The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryü used dual blades, so Honn Shinsakura was naturally best at dual blades. He only used one instead of two not because Zhou Wen had only used one saber for the three strikes he had taught, but because Honn Shinsakura wanted to avenge Sei Gasakai’s humiliation. Since Mohe had defeated him with a water sword, he had to use a single blade to defeat Mohe.

Mohe looked at Honn Shinsakura as a strange glint flashed in his eyes. After all, he was a Calamity-grade expert. He could sense the changes in Honn Shinsakura’s aura, but he still couldn’t figure out what Honn Shinsakura had learned from the three strikes. He could only watch helplessly as Zhou Wen taught the three strikes. He really couldn’t figure out what tricks the three strikes could produce.

Mohe casually grabbed and condensed seawater into a sword again. He looked at Honn Shinsakura and said indifferently, “Don’t waste any more time.

Attack.”

Although he knew that Honn Shinsakura had grown, Mohe didn’t believe that he could grow to the point of defeating him. Even if Zhou Wen had taught him a godlike sword technique, it was impossible for him to raise Honn Shinsakura to a level that could match him in such a short period of time.

Furthermore, the three strikes Zhou Wen taught were only the basic sword techniques of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryü.

In a true battle between experts, confidence was also an important part. If one wasn’t confident, it would be very difficult to win unless one’s strength was truly overwhelming. How could Mohe make such a mistake?

Honn Shinsakura didn’t say anything else. He held the blade in one hand and slashed at Mohe.

This strike wasn’t one of the three strikes Zhou Wen had taught him. Instead, it was the strike Sei Gasakai had slashed at Mohe. It was almost identical without any difference.

Indeed, the three strikes Zhou Wen taught are useless. He’s using Sei Gasakai’s Sword Dao. Those three strikes arejust a ruse. However, aren’t you underestimating me? How can such a trick succeed in front of me?

Furthermore, I’ve just cracked the sword stance he’s using. A thought flashed through Mohe’s mind, but he didn’t hesitate to thrust his sword out again.

The battle between the two was almost a replay of the battle between Sei Gasakai and Mohe. The only difference was that Honn Shinsakura only had one blade in his hand and didn’t have the ability to protect himself.

“This...” Shiraishi Satomi was at a loss for words. Sei Gasakai had already tried using the same strike, so this strike was bound to fail. Yet, Honn Shinsakura had actually replicated his attempt.

It wasn’t just her. None of the disciples of the Niten Flymg Immortal Palace understood. The Elders even wondered if Honn Shinsakura’s brain was damaged.

Only Sei Gasakai seemed to understand something. He shook his head slightly and said with a smile, “This child sure is thoughtful.”

The ice sword that advanced at an extremely slow speed collided with the blade that slashed over crazily again. The ice sword was shattered again. Everything was identical to the last time, as though a movie had been replayed.

Although Mohe was confident, he was still somewhat afraid. Therefore, he held back and prepared to deal with any development that cropped up.

However, nothing happened. Honn Shinsakura’s blade shattered his ice sword. The ice sword fragments transformed into water that flowed past Honn

Shinsakura’s blade and condensed into a water sword that pointed at his chest.

I won? Mohe naturally found it unbelievable that everything would go so smoothly, but seeing that the water sword was about to stab Honn Shinsakura’s chest, he had to believe it.

Suddenly, Mohe’s heart palpitated as though he sensed dire danger. His eyes focused and he immediately realized that Honn Shinsakura’s blade had already slashed at his waist at some point in time.

His sword and Honn Shinsakura’s blade could hit each other almost at the same time, but he only held a water sword while Honn Shinsakura held a Terror-grade Companion Beast blade. If they were to hit each other, the outcome would be different.

Unless Mohe used powers that exceeded the Terror grade, he would definitely be the one suffering. When that happened, he would naturally lose.

I thought it was some brilliant sword technique, but it turns out that you just want to use this method to defeat me. Aren’t you too naive? Mohe’s

Calamity-grade thinking ability and reaction were naturally not something Honn Shinsakura could compare with. At that instant, countless thoughts flashed through Mohe’s mind.

Almost at the same time, his body naturally moved. His figure moved slightly as he maintained the water sword’s thrust and speed.

This way, Honn Shinsakura’s blade would brush past him, and his water sword would hit Honn Shinsakura. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

In fact, this reaction had exceeded the limits of the Terror grade. However, this wasn’t a substantial Calamity -grade power, so it couldn’t be said that the Mohe violated the rules.

However, after Mohe did all of this, his pupils suddenly constricted as he revealed a look of disbelief as though he had seen a ghost.

He originally imagined that Honn Shinsakura had used all his strength to slash out, but that wasn’t the case at all. Honn Shinsakura’s reaction speed was far inferior to his, so it was impossible for him to keep up with his changes and adapt. However, Honn Shinsakura seemed to have anticipated the change in moves. The blade’s angle changed midway—almost at the same moment as Mohe. It happened to restrain Mohe’s new move.

Mohe never expected such a situation to happen. It was as though his opponent was prescient. If he hadn’t moved and continued the stab, Honn Shinsakura would have already lost.

However, due to his movement, Honn Shinsakura happened to be able to restrain him. At such a close distance, unless he used the speed of a Calamity-grade to move again, he wouldn’t be able to do anything.

In that instant of hesitation, the water sword in Mohe’s hand was shattered by the blade in Honn Shinsakura’s hand. The tip of the blade stopped in front of Mohe’s chest.

Instantly, there was only the sound of the sea waves. Everyone seemed to be petrified as they watched Honn Shinsakura point his blade at Mohe’s chest.

“Am I f*cking dreaming?” On the ship, someone shouted in a fugue..
