Chapter 883: Thirteen Moves Sword Technique

However, in the next few days, Zhou Wen didn’t see the white-robed man again. The entire valley was empty, making Zhou Wen suspect that this dimensional zone was a prison specially used to hold people.

Thankfully, Ya’er was by Zhou Wen’s side. Although she seldom spoke, having someone by his side made him feel much better.

As Zhou Wen set up the traps in the valley, he grinded his phone as he waited for the white-robed person to appear again.

This wait lasted for seven days. Seven nights later, Zhou Wen finally heard the familiar sound of a flute. He hurriedly ran to the peach blossom tree by the stream and saw the white-robed man sitting at the spot where he had been playing the flute.

The sound of his flute was quiet and ethereal, making one feel relaxed after hearing it. It gave one a sense of freedom that allowed one to forget their worries.

Zhou Wen’s mind was firm and he wasn’t affected by the flute’s sound. He only thought about how to subdue the white-robed man and ask him how to leave.

“We meet again.” After the tune, the white-robed man looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Do you want a drink this time?”

“I just want to know how to leave this place.” Zhou Wen stared intently at the white-robed man. No matter what, he couldn’t allow him to disappear like the previous time.

“It looks like you’ve already made up your mind,” the person in white said as he held his wine glass.

“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly as he gripped the Bamboo Blade in his hand. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Alright then. I can tell you how to leave this place, but I have a condition,” the white-robed man said, surprising Zhou Wen.

“What condition?” Zhou Wen looked at the white-robed man in surprise.

“Do you know how to use a sword?” the person in white said as he fiddled with the wine cup.

“Not really. I’ve only learned a few sword techniques,” Zhou Wen answered.

“It’s fine even if you don’t. I have a sword technique here. As long as you can learn this sword technique, I’ll tell you the way to leave this place,” said the white-robed man.

“Why?” Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed. He had never seen such a dimensional creature.

“No reason. Do you want to learn it?” The person in white didn’t explain.

“I’ll learn.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and nodded in agreement.

“My sword technique has a total of thirteen moves. It’s not too difficult. No matter how stupid you are, you should be able to learn it in five days.” As the white-robed man spoke, he stood up and casually picked up a withered branch from the ground before performing his swordplay.

He used the branch as a sword and demonstrated the set of sword techniques. The sword technique was ethereal and elegant, without any killing intent.

Most sword techniques in the world pursued the ability to injure enemies, but this sword technique of his didn’t have any oppression. Instead of saying it was for killing enemies, it was more like a swordplay that was for entertainment.

Soon, the white-robed man finished demonstrating the thirteen sword moves. He looked at Zhou Wen with a faint smile. “Have you memorized them?”

“Got it.” Zhou Wen had an excellent memory, and the thirteen moves weren’t too complicated. He remembered every move clearly.

The person in white smiled. “Find me after you’ve mastered it.”

“There’s no need to go through so much trouble. I’ll show it to you now. It shouldn’t be too difficult to master it in a night. As long as I can demonstrate the complete sword technique, it’ll count as me mastering it, right?” Zhou Wen said to the white-robed man.

“That’s right. As long as you can completely use that sword technique once, I’ll count you as mastering it.” The bamboo flute in the white-robed man’s hand spun between his fingers.

“Alright, I’ll demonstrate it to you now,” Zhou Wen said as he summoned a Legendary thin sword. It was a Companion Egg that had dropped from the Ancient Sword Tomb. It wasn’t usually of much use. Based on its size, it was more suitable for this sword technique, so Zhou Wen casually summoned it.

Zhou Wen held the sword and recalled the white-robed man’s sword technique in his mind. After confirming that he hadn’t forgotten any details, Zhou Wen began striking.

With his combat experience and talent, it was too easy for him to imitate a set of sword techniques. Even if it were more than a hundred moves, Zhou Wen could replicate them with just one look; what’s more thirteen moves.

However, when Zhou Wen stabbed out with his sword, he was stunned. He couldn’t continue the swordplay after the thrust.

It wasn’t that the sword technique’s moves were difficult. With Zhou Wen’s present physique, he could carry out any movement as long as a human body was capable of doing it.

However, Zhou Wen couldn’t continue the thrust no matter what he did. This was because he realized that the sword technique in his memories was somewhat different from the one the white-robed man had demonstrated.

Strange! How is it different? Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he retracted the sword he had thrust out and carefully recalled the white-robed man’s sword techniques.

Memories of the sword technique appeared clearly in Zhou Wen’s mind, but his expression gradually changed.

This was because the sword technique in his mind was completely different from the one he had just memorized.

This feeling was very strange. It was like a person clearly remembering someone in red clothes, but when they recalled it again, the color of the person’s clothes turned white.

The clashing of memories was something Zhou Wen had never encountered before.

He turned to look at the white-robed man and wanted to ask him what was going on, but there was no one under the peach blossom tree. The white-robed man had long vanished.

Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he recalled the thirteen moves. This time, it was different from the previous two memories.

It was like Zhou Wen had memorized three different sword techniques. Although the sword techniques all had thirteen moves, the styles were completely different.

The sword technique demonstrated by the white-robed man was elegant, but the sword technique in Zhou Wen’s memory was ferocious and domineering in his second memory. The sword technique in his third memory was mild and mysterious, making Zhou Wen doubt his own memories.

Then, when Zhou Wen wanted to carefully recall it again, he realized that the sword technique had changed again. The sword technique he recalled every time seemed different.

What’s going on? Zhou Wen’s expression changed constantly. He was certain that there was nothing wrong with his memory, but why was his memory constantly changing? Zhou Wen couldn’t figure it out.

Is it an illusion? Zhou Wen quickly rejected this thought. He was very focused. Even an illusion couldn’t shake his will. If it was purely an illusion, it was impossible for it to affect his brain.

If it’s not an illusion, then there’s something wrong with the sword technique itself. Zhou Wen recalled the thirteen moves again and again. He wanted to try and see how many different memories he had.

The night passed as the sun rose and set. When night came again, Zhou Wen had already recalled more than a hundred times, but the sword techniques he recalled were different every time. None of them were repeated.

With the moon above the branches, the white-robed man appeared under the peach blossom tree again. He sat on a tree root and held a wine flask in one hand and a wine cup in the other. As he poured himself wine, he asked, “Have you memorized it?”
