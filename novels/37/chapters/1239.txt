Chapter 1240: Battle of Mount Laojun 2

Translator: CKtalon

“Overseer An, how have you been?” Hermit’s gaze swept across Zhou Wen’s face before landing on An Tianzuo’s face.

Although the An family had many experts, there were only two people he cared about.

“It’s my honor to have two Heavenly Kings of the League of Guardians take action together,” An Tianzuo said with a smile.

“It’s only right. After all, it’s Overseer An.” Hermit looked at Smith and company. Seeing that they were only chained up and the situation wasn’t bad, he continued, “Overseer An, it looks like you aren’t determined to betray the Federation. Why don’t we do this? Return with us and explain things to Congress. There’s no need to make a big fuss over a misunderstanding. What do you think, Overseer?”

“Are we going to the Federation’s Congress or the Alliance’s Congress?” An Tianzuo asked.

.

“From the looks of it, Overseer is bent on becoming enemies with the Federation.” Hermit’s expression changed slightly. Everyone knew that only the Federation had a Congress. How could there be an Alliance Congress?

An Tianzuo’s words were clearly mocking the League for secretly controlling the Federation Congress.

“Didn’t you come here for the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg and Thief Sage? If I were to tell you that I didn’t capture Thief Sage or obtain the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg, would you believe me?” An Tianzuo said slowly.

“Overseer, you must be joking. If you didn’t obtain it, why go through so much trouble? A smart person like you wouldn’t joke around with the An family’s lives, right?” Hermit naturally didn’t believe him.

“Of course not. I don’t like to mess around either. However, you have shown your preference to mess around with me. You always get people I don’t like to mess around with me at times I dislike.” An Tianzuo looked at Hermit and said, “Therefore, I have to do something to let you know that I’m not someone who likes to mess around. It’s to prevent you from having any further misunderstandings.”

At this point, Hermit didn’t deny anything. He only said indifferently, “Then, Overseer, what do you plan on doing to let those people know that you don’t like to mess around?”

“Tell them loudly that I don’t like fooling around,” An Tianzuo said solemnly.

“I’m afraid that just saying it won’t work,” Hermit said.

“Who knows? It might be useful,” An Tianzuo said.

“Overseer, if you wish to say something, you can say it in Congress. There are people there who are very willing to listen to you. If you can move them, it might be of some use,” Hermit said.

“What if I don’t?” An Tianzuo said.

“That’s our duty,” Hermit said solemnly.

“I’ve long heard that the four Heavenly Kings of the League of Guardians are invincible. I’ve always wanted to verify that.” An Tianzuo remained unperturbed.

“If Overseer is interested, I’m willing to accompany you down Mount Laojun.” Unless it was a last resort, Hermit didn’t wish to take action on Mount Laojun.

“Sure,” An Tianzuo said as he walked down the steps.

Hermit and Blood Shaman were slightly taken aback as they exchanged looks. Seeing that An Tianzuo had already walked down, they could only retreat down the mountain.

“Stay here and wait for me,” An Tianzuo instructed. He stopped the Sunset Army from following him down the mountain before walking down alone.

Although Hermit and Blood Shaman were somewhat puzzled as to why An Tianzuo would give up on Mount Laojun and follow them down the mountain alone, it was clearly beneficial to them. There was no reason for them not to accept it.

Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled as well. He didn’t know what An Tianzuo was up to, but since An Sheng wasn’t around, he couldn’t ask anyone. All he could do was whisper to Ouyang Lan who was carrying Ya’er. “Sis Lan, what’s going on?”

Zhou Wen already realized that something was amiss. He believed An Tianzuo’s words. Perhaps An Tianzuo really hadn’t captured Liu Yun.

This was because he knew very well that Liu Yun didn’t have the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg. Even if An Tianzuo captured Liu Yun, it was impossible for him to obtain a Companion Egg. However, he didn’t understand why An Tianzuo would do this. The outcome of his actions was making the entire world believe that he had obtained the Companion Egg.

Could it be that he wants to lure all the members of the League of Guardians over and wipe them out? Zhou Wen felt that An Tianzuo was crazy enough to carry that out.

Ignoring the fact that the League of Guardians was extremely powerful, there were many Terror-grade experts other than the four Heavenly Kings. An Tianzuo was the only Terror-grade expert in the An family, so they had no chance of winning. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even if they had a chance of winning, the League of Guardians had the dimension behind them. When the time came, if the dimension really wanted to destroy the An family at all costs, it wouldn’t be difficult to gather more Terror-grade Guardians.

Zhou Wen had heard from An Sheng that not all the Terror-grade Guardians in the League of Guardians came from the Guardian cocoons. Many Guardians were sent over from the dimension using special means. The League of Guardians would subsequently choose suitable humans to contract them.

After all, Guardians were created from the dimension. It wasn’t difficult to create more.

However, the Guardians that were sent directly from the dimension seemed to possess flaws. Despite being at the same Terror grade, those that were sent from the dimension couldn’t compare to the Guardians that had grown up on Earth.

Even so, it was already terrifying. The Terror grade was nothing to scoff at after all. Only a Terror grade could match it. It was already a top combat power on Earth.

Just like the Guardians that came with Blood Shaman and Hermit, there were seven to eight at the Terror grade. Even Zhou Wen didn’t dare underestimate such terrifying combat strength.

“I don’t know. Little Zuo didn’t say, but you don’t have to worry. Little Zuo knows his limits. He naturally has his plans,” Ouyang Lan said.

“Why would I be worried about him? I’m worried about you,” Zhou Wen said.

Ouyang Lan smiled and said, “It’s all the same.”

Blood Shaman and Hermit found it unbelievable that An Tianzuo followed them down the mountain alone. Even Zhou Wen hadn’t come down with him.

“Overseer, you have such boldness and magnanimity. I’ll warm up with you.” Hermit glanced at Blood Shaman, signaling him to attack at any time.

“Attack together, all of you.” As An Tianzuo spoke, he had already summoned his strange Life Soul to fuse with him.

His slender figure was wrapped in white metal armor. A blood-colored cape fluttered behind him like a blood-colored rainbow. He held a huge sword over his shoulder and a Gatling in his other hand. His appearance was indescribably domineering.

Zhou Wen was also watching An Tianzuo. He had yet to see An Tianzuo’s true strength. The last time An Tianzuo fought Xiao, he had already lost an arm. His combat strength had been greatly affected, so it hadn’t been his true strength.

“Since Overseer wishes so, we can only agree.” Hermit didn’t stand on ceremony as he called for Blood Shaman to attack with him.

He vaguely felt that something was amiss and began to worry. He planned on ending the battle quickly and taking down An Tianzuo first.
