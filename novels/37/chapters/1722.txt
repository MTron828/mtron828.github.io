Chapter 1723 Canyon

The Heaven-level Chaos Egg still didn’t have any offensive abilities, but its defense became unimaginably powerful. Even the strange power of the rainbow flames couldn’t cause any substantial damage to the Chaos Egg.

From the looks of it, the Chaos Egg is purely a defensive Essence Energy Art. It would be even better if it had some offensive strength, Zhou Wen thought greedily.

With the Heaven-level Chaos Egg protecting him, the rainbow flames couldn’t harm Zhou Wen anymore. Instead, the number of Essence Energy Crystals in the Chaos Egg reached an astronomical number. It benefited a gluttonous Companion Beast like Tyrant Behemoth.

After all, Essence Energy Crystals were useless. Zhou Wen got the Companion Beasts that could absorb Essence Energy Crystals to absorb them as best they could. Imperial Lord Behemoth’s crazy devouring made it advance to the Hell level. As long as there was enough time, it was only a matter of time before it advanced to the Heaven level.

It’s easier to rear a Companion Beast like Imperial Lord Behemoth. As long as there’s food, it can advance. If others knew of Zhou Wen’s thoughts, they would probably vomit blood.

If it were an ordinary person raising Imperial Lord Behemoth, not having it starve to death would be amazing enough. Advancing to the Calamity grade was an extravagant hope.

Explosive Fiend Man had also swallowed quite a number of Essence Energy Crystals and it came close to advancing to the Calamity grade -it was one of the few Companion Beasts that could advance to the Calamity grade with Essence Energy Crystals.

“Bro, stop fooling around. We need to gonow. The immortal sword over there isn’t waiting for anyone. If it’s really taken by the Immortals, it would be too late for regrets,” Liu Yun said gloomily.

Although Zhou Wen really wanted to stay here and use the rainbow flames to raise his Companion Beasts—where raising Imperial Lord Behemoth to the Heaven level was the best possible outcome before leaving-he gave up after some thought.

Since there was already a solution and the dungeon had been successfully downloaded, there were plenty of opportunities in the future. He might not stand another chance with that sword in the future.

Things like the Immortal Culling Sword might not exist in-game. It was useless even if he downloaded the dungeon.

If that sword was really a set with the Immortal Culling Sword, it was better to have it in his hands than have the Immortals possess it.

If it were in the past, Zhou Wen might have been somewhat hesitant, unwilling to take the risk in such a dangerous place. Now that the Chaos Egg had advanced to the Heaven level, his worries were greatly reduced.

“Let’s go.” Zhou Wen stopped fighting the rainbow phoenix and charged into the stone chamber against the rainbow flames.

The rainbow phoenix indignantly spewed fire at Zhou Wen as it chased after him, eager to burn him to ashes. Unfortunately, it could only watch as Zhou Wen rushed into the stone chamber and entered the pit.

The golden-winged bird cried out angrily, but unfortunately, it couldn’t touch Zhou Wen.

It was unknown if the rainbow phoenix and the golden-winged bird refused to enter because they disdained the pit for being a toilet or if there was some other reason, but they didn’t chase after them.

“Go back.” Seeing the rainbow phoenix cease its pursuit, he dispelled the Chaos Egg in the tunnel and planned on letting the grass fruit baby return alone.

Although this thing was magical, it involved too many variables. It wasn’t under Zhou Wen’s control, so it might be troublesome to take it back.

Furthermore, ordinary Calamity creatures couldn’t randomly leave dimensional zones. It wasn’t easy for creatures to break out of the dimensional zones.

It wasn’t difficult to break out of ordinary dimensional zones, but it wasn’t that simple to break out of a dimensional zone like Kunlun.

The grass fruit baby sat on Zhou Wen’s shoulder, but it didn’t seem to hear him. It remained motionless as it looked at Zhou Wen with an innocent expression.

“Go back to where you come from.” Zhou Wen pointed inside.

The grass fruit baby remained motionless as though it didn’t understand what Zhou Wen was saying

Forget it. It will naturally return at the exit when it realizes it can’t leave. Zhou Wen continued heading for the exit.

To his surprise, after Zhou Wen stepped out the exit, the grass fruit baby followed him out of the Kunlun Mountain dimensional zone without any obstruction.

“You’re finally out!” Liu Yun was already waiting outside. He heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Zhou Wen come out.

“Where’s your grandfather?” Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t see Jing Daoxian.

“Don’t mention it. There wasn’t any response after I sent the message. I don’t know where he went.” Liu Yun shrugged and continued, “Let’s not talk about this for now. We are far behind schedule. I don’t know if we can make it now.”

“Let’s go.” Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else as he turned around and headed for the pool.

“Aren’t you going to deal with this thing first?” Liu Yun pointed at the grass fruit baby on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.

Going to such a dangerous place with such an unknown item was equivalent to carrying a time bomb. Who knew when something would happen?

Zhou Wen glanced at the grass fruit baby and pondered for a moment before shaking his head. “Forget it. Let’s talk when we get there.”

Liu Yun didn’t say anything else as the two of them headed for the entrance to the pool.

The entrance to the pool was beneath the pool’s surface. At the end of the underground river-like waterway was a bigger pool. One could still hear rumbling sounds.

Before surfacing, Zhou Wen first used the Teacher Domain to scan the nearby area and realized that this place was completely different from the place they had entered.

This was a huge canyon. They were under a waterfall that was probably ten thousand feet tall. The cascading water was like a roaring white dragon hanging from the mountain wall. It looked extremely spectacular.

However, they didn’t find the phoenix or immortal sword that Liu Yun had mentioned. There was flowing water in the canyon, and there were plenty of fungi growing on the cliffs on both sides. The big ones were almost like houses, and the small ones were about the size of millstones. They stacked on the stone walls and looked like circular roofs.

The fungi were colorful and beautiful. The entire canyon appeared to be a fairyland.

“Be careful. The spores emitted by these mushrooms are everywhere. If you accidentally breathe them in, they will parasitize your body and suck dry your flesh and blood as nutrients…” Liu Yun knew that Zhou Wen’s eyesight had reached a microscopic level and could see the spores, but he still warned him.

“Don’t tell me there are dimensional creatures like the Ganoderma Baby here?” Zhou Wen remembered reading on the Internet that someone had obtained a Ganoderma Baby Companion Beast that had extremely powerful recovery skills. Typical injuries could be instantly healed.

It was said that it had the ability to resurrect the dead. As long as a person was still breathing, no matter how serious their injuries were, they could be treated. However, that ability seemed to require sacrificing the Ganoderma Companion Beast. Even so, it was already very enviable. Zhou Wen had long wanted to get one, but it was too rare. He couldn’t buy it, nor did he know which dimensional zone it came from.

“I didn’t hear the old man mention that there’s such a thing. He only told me that the spores here are very terrifying. We mustn’t let them enter our bodies,” Liu Yun said after some thought.

Liu Yun’s words reminded Zhou Wen of a Companion Beast of his.
