Chapter 803: Ya’er

Translator: CKtalon

Crack!

The crystal container outside the Kuman Nee shattered and the Corpse Oil inside flowed out.

Kuman Nee was already too big for a container. Her flesh was full, and her skin grew out. This was followed by her hair and nails.

In just a moment, the originally shrunken and blurry Kuman Nee became a healthy-looking baby.

The fair and tender baby looked no different from a normal baby, but upon careful inspection of her body, one would discover that her heart wasn’t beating, and the blood in her body wasn’t circulating.

She could be said to be dead, but everything about her was normal. There was life in her body, and even her eyes were open. She was like a normal baby, but she didn’t even have a heart. It was difficult to understand if she was dead or alive.

When Zhou Wen returned to his residence, the baby had already grown to the size of a one-year-old toddler. However, it looked like it had stopped growing.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that it would grow to the size of Gu Lady, but to his surprise, it stopped growing.

Could it be that she was affected by the chaos space when I placed her inside? Zhou Wen took the girl out and bathed her. He washed the Corpse Oil off her body and placed her on the bed.

However, the female toddler didn’t continue growing. She remained as big as before as she sat on the bed and looked at Zhou Wen expressionlessly.

Zhou Wen took out a set of clothes he had bought for Demonic Neonate from the chaos space. He had originally planned on letting Demonic Neonate wear them when she had nothing to do for fun, but now, they came in handy.

However, she was slightly smaller than Demonic Neonate, so the clothes would be oversized when she put them on. However, these were the most suitable clothes Zhou Wen could find for her. She would have to make do with them and wait till he bought more for her in the future.

“Do you know how to put clothes on?” Zhou Wen asked the girl.

The girl shook her head and continued looking at Zhou Wen.

Could it be that she has become a child, and even her intelligence has regressed? Zhou Wen had no choice but to help her put them on. Then, he looked at the girl sitting on the bed and asked, “Do you still remember me?”

Zhou Wen didn’t know what was happening. The knowledge he learned from Gu Shanshui didn’t include this.

According to Gu Shanshui, if there were no restrictions, the spirit body could return to its original body, but it wouldn’t revive. It only had autonomy.

Typically, Kuman Nee, who had autonomy, were very dangerous. As they died unjustly, their resentment wouldn’t dissipate, and they would constantly harm others.

Zhou Wen didn’t wish to rear Gu Lady like Xiao Tianfang, so he didn’t plan on turning her into his Kuman Nee. Instead, he planned on using another method to take her away.

However, to his surprise, before Zhou Wen used that method, Gu Lady came alive and turned into a baby. The method Gu Shanshui had taught him was probably useless.

The girl nodded. It looked like she still remembered him.

“From the looks of it, you still have your memories.” Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. It was easy if she still had her memories.

“Now that you are free, what plans do you have?” Zhou Wen asked the girl.

The girl looked at Zhou Wen without answering, as though she didn’t know what he meant.

“I mean, where do you want to go in the future?” Zhou Wen was afraid that she wouldn’t understand, so he changed his phrasing.

The girl continued looking at him without saying a word. It was unknown if she understood him.

“Well... What’s your name?” Zhou Wen wanted to call her by name, but he realized that he definitely didn’t know her name. He couldn’t call her Gu Lady like Xiao Tianfang, right? She probably wouldn’t like that form of address.

The girl finally reacted and shook her head at Zhou Wen.

“You don’t have a name?” Zhou Wen asked.

Seeing the girl nod, Zhou Wen knew that he had guessed correctly. After some thought, he said, “Shall I give you a name then?”

The girl nodded again. This made Zhou Wen know that she could understand him. Her intelligence didn’t regress, but for some reason, she couldn’t speak.

Zhou Wen seriously considered for a while before sizing up the girl. Then, he carefully asked, “What do you think of the name Xiaoli?”

The girl remained expressionless, but she subtly turned her face away.

“Don’t like it? How about Xiaona?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.

The girl was expressionless as though she hadn’t heard Zhou Wen. She raised her arm and pointed at Zhou Wen’s chest.

Zhou Wen looked down and realized that there was nothing but clothes on his chest. There were no patterns or words.

Could it be... She’s referring to this... Zhou Wen reached into his collar and took out a pendant akin to ivory.

This was a pendant carved by Wang Mingyuan. It was said to be carved from the tooth of the White Dragon in Old Dragon’s Well. As for the origins of the dragon’s tooth, it was said that Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun had stolen it from Old Dragon’s Well. However, Wang Mingyuan said that he had picked it up himself.

She can still see through things. From the looks of it, she still has her powers. Zhou Wen knew that he had guessed correctly when he saw the girl’s finger track the pendant as he moved it.

“You want to use this pendant as a name? Got it. It’s carved from a dragon’s tooth, so you want to be called Xiaolong, right?” Zhou Wen was enlightened.

The girl was expressionless as she stared at him without any reaction. After staring at him for quite some time without blinking, Zhou Wen felt a little creeped out.

“That’s not it? What about Xiaoya?” Zhou Wen asked guiltily.

The girl looked at Zhou Wen with a strange look before slowly nodding. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhou Wen looked at the girl’s eyes and felt that she was about to give up. He also didn’t feel too good about it, so he thought for a moment and said, “Xiaoya doesn’t sound nice. It doesn’t sound like a girl’s name. Why don’t we call you Ya’er? This ‘ya’ means sprouting. I hope you can grow up quickly.”

The girl nodded slightly. Although it was still a little forced, she didn’t have the look of giving up like before.

“Alright, I’ll call you Ya’er from now on.” Zhou Wen wiped the sweat off his forehead and looked at Ya’er. “Ya’er, can you still control the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings?”

Ya’er nodded and Zhou Wen felt relieved. If Ya’er couldn’t control the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings, his plan would fail. Although the outcome might still be the same, Zhou Wen didn’t like things that he couldn’t control.

“Can you still make others not see you?” Zhou Wen asked again.

This time, Ya’er shook her head. Clearly, she could no longer exist in her spirit body state.

Zhou Wen asked some more questions and roughly gained an understanding of Ya’er, but what he knew remained limited. She couldn’t speak, so Zhou Wen could only probe.

Now, he only knew that Ya’er’s ability, memory, and intelligence hadn’t changed. It was the same as before, but for some reason, her body had stopped growing.

Is she considered a living person now? Zhou Wen couldn’t determine Ya’er’s situation, so he could only ask her, “What do you want to do now?”

“Kill.” Ya’er actually said one word.

“So you can speak?” Zhou Wen looked at Ya’er in shock. He had been gesturing for so long, but it turned out that Ya’er could speak.
