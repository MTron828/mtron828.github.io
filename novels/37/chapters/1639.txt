Chapter 1640 You’re A Fool

“Can you endure the pain? I want to see how much you can tolerate.” The boy kicked Laughing Li again and again. He even stepped on Laughing Li’s fingers and crushed them bit by bit.

Yet, as a ten-year-old boy, he didn’t even grunt under such torture. His face twitched unnaturally as his forehead was covered in cold sweat. His eyes were bloodshot and his eyeballs were about to pop out.

However, it was obvious that Laughing Li was trying his best to control his expression. He tried his best not to let his expressions and reactions be mimicked by the boy who looked like him. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

No matter how the boy tortured Laughing Li, his expression didn’t change much. Apart from the pain in his body that made his face twitch uncontrollably, it was difficult to find any other expression on Laughing Li’s face.

There was no sign of anger or hate on his face. The boy only saw mockery and disdain in Laughing Li’s eyes.

This seemed to strike a nerve in the boy, causing anger and violence to appear on his expressionless face. He directly stepped on Laughing Li’s head, leaving it covered in blood. He refused to stop.

“Haha…” Despite being tortured like this, Laughing Li laughed happily.

Looking at the laughing Laughing Li, the boy couldn’t help but be taken aback. He really didn’t understand why Laughing Li could still laugh so happily. Shouldn’t Laughing Li be crying bitterly at such a time? Shouldn’t he be filled with resentment and anger? Shouldn’t he hate him to the core? Shouldn’t he be horrified and uneasy?

None of this happened. Laughing Li was only laughing. Furthermore, he was laughing very happily. It was a joy that came from the bottom of his heart, not an act. There was even a hint of smugness in his smile.

For some reason, when he saw Laughing Li laughing, the boy’s heart burned with anger. As he stomped on Laughing Li’s face, he asked through gritted teeth, “What are you laughing at?”

“I’m laughing at you… Laughing at how you don’t get it at all…” Laughing Li’s mouth was covered in blood as he spoke intermittently. As there was too much blood, his words were hardly discernible.

“What don’t I get?” The boy lowered his head and approached Laughing Li, hoping to hear what he was saying. “That you’re a fool!” However, the moment the boy approached Laughing Li, Laughing Li suddenly opened his mouth and spat a mouthful of blood on the boy’s face. The boy subconsciously closed his eyes.

Bang!

Just as his eyes closed, Laughing Li’s headbutted him in the chin, causing the boy’s chin to distort as he leaned his head back.

At that moment, Laughing Li seemed to go mental. He didn’t care about his injuries or if his bones were broken. His bloody palm slammed into the boy’s face.

Laughing Li’s palm deformed from the impact. His already fractured fingers were distorted beyond recognition.

However, Laughing Li ignored all of that. Like a lunatic, he rushed forward and punched and kicked the boy. He even bit him with his teeth.

In the beginning, the boy managed to resist, but it was unknown if he was frightened by Laughing Li or if he was punch-drunk. The boy, who was clearly stronger than Laughing Li in terms of strength, speed, and technique, was beaten until he screamed repeatedly. He even wanted to escape, but how could he? His body was covered in blood. It was impossible to tell if it was his or Laughing Li’s.

Bang!

An old man in a Saint costume appeared in the room and sent Laughing Li, who was beating up the boy, flying with a slap. Laughing Li’s body shattered the window and fell into the garden outside. He rolled far away and landed on the ground. It was unknown if he was dead or alive.

However, seeing that he was covered in blood and many parts of his body had broken bones, he was probably doomed.

“Useless.” The old man glared at the boy on the ground and cursed coldly.

The boy jolted in fright. He immediately got up and kowtowed to the old man. “Your Excellency… No… Don’t kill me… Don’t…”

“The Holy Land spent so much time, energy, and resources to nurture you, but you are inferior to a child from an ordinary family clan. What’s the point of having you?” the old man said with a cold expression.

“Your Excellency… I… I can do it… I was just careless… I definitely won’t make the same mistake again…” The boy kowtowed in horror.

“Forget it. It’s troublesome to do another round of nurturing. Continue your mission. You should know what to do next, right?” As the old man spoke, he looked at Laughing Li, whose fate was unknown. “For you to be incapable of killing the boy you are to replace and to require my help, it’s a disgrace to the Holy Land.”

“There definitely won’t be a next time,” the boy hurriedly said with his head lowered.

“Quickly dispose of his corpse,” the old man said coldly.

“Yes, yes. I’ll do it right away.” The boy hurriedly rushed into the garden and took out a small bottle. He poured the liquid in the small bottle onto Laughing Li.

Laughing Li’s clothes were immediately corroded by the liquid as his flesh and bones began to melt. “A terrifying figure is approaching. Hide the corpse until he completely disintegrates. I’ll hold back that person,” the old man suddenly said with a heavy expression as he looked out into the darkness.

The boy hurriedly picked up Laughing Li’s corpse and looked around. Finally, he pushed it into the grass and hid the corpse there. When the boy turned around to take a look again, he realized that the old man had already vanished. He looked around uneasily for a while before the old man finally returned.

“Who was it?” the boy hurriedly asked.

“Hmph, it’s none of your business. Has the corpse disintegrated?” the old man said coldly.

The boy hurriedly pulled away the grass and looked again. He realized that there was only some foul liquid in the grass. Apart from that, there was nothing else.

“It’s done,” the boy said.

The old man took a look and nodded when he saw the liquid. “From today onwards, you are the eldest young master of the Li family, Uncrying Li, understand?” “Yes, Your Excellency. I’m Uncrying Li,” the boy hurriedly said.

The old man reached out his hand and did a swipe, lifting up the smelly liquid along with the vegetation and soil. He sucked it into a huge cloth bag before turning to leave.

“Your Excellency, how should I contact you?” the boy hurriedly asked.

“There’s no need to contact me. You are Uncrying Li. Uncrying Li is you. Only when the Holy Land needs you will you be a Saint. When you are needed, a Saint will naturally summon you.” With that said, the man left the Li family compound.

Strangely enough, after the old man left, the Li family, which was like a land of the dead, suddenly seemed to return to normal. There were sounds of night insects everywhere, and even the sound of people getting up at night to go to the bathroom.

“I’m Uncrying Li… I’m Uncrying Li…” the boy muttered to himself a few times before treating his wounds and cleaning up the glass window shards…

After he returned to his room, in a pool not far from the grass, a beautiful boy secretly surfaced with the heavily injured Laughing Li.

Looking at Laughing Li’s room, the beautiful boy hesitated for a moment before leaving the Li family’s residence with the dying Laughing Li on his back.
