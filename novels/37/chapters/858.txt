Chapter 859: Mythical Tiger Soul General

After some hesitation, Zhou Wen still couldn’t make up his mind whether to incubate it. He first matched the Companion Egg with his pets.

In fact, Zhou Wen really wanted to throw it away. None of its skills and abilities made Zhou Wen find them especially useful. They all had various flaws.

The only thing that made it better was that it was especially fierce when it did evil. It was especially powerful when dealing with good people.

If Zhou Wen was a devil, Qiongqi would be an excellent-grade demon apart from its Badlands skill. It could unleash extremely powerful combat strength.

The problem was that Zhou Wen didn’t like to do evil, nor did he plan on killing good people. With such a thing and the risk of being poor while having nothing to eat, Zhou Wen really didn’t want to incubate it.

After watching for a while, he realized that Qiongqi’s compatibility with the other Companion Beasts wasn’t high. Just as Zhou Wen was about to throw it away, he thought of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General he had summoned and matched it.

The 93% compatibility surprised Zhou Wen.

Birds of a feather flock together. The compatibility between these two fellows is astonishingly high. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it was a pity to throw away the Mythical Qiongqi, a top-notch Mythical creature, and its evolutionary ability.

From the looks of it, Jinxes Master doesn’t seem to do much to me. Why don’t I try fusing them? Perhaps there will be a good outcome after the two flawed Companion Beasts fuse? Even if they do not change for the better, it won’t be any worse. Zhou Wen decided to give it a try as he placed the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General on the Qiongqi Companion Egg and chose to fuse them.

The 93% compatibility was as genuine as it could be. As a supplementary ingredient, the Qiongqi Companion Egg transformed into a stream of light and entered the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body, quickly completing the fusion.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General that had been successfully fused didn’t look much different. However, the tiger under the Tiger Soul General looked a little like Qiongqi.

Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at its stats and thought to himself, If only I could erase Jinxes Master.

“...”

After seeing the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s stats, Zhou Wen was dumbfounded.

These stats were considered excellent. It was basically impossible to be stronger. It was the first time Zhou Wen had seen a Companion Beast with eight skills. Furthermore, there was a possibility of further improvement in the future. Perhaps it could achieve Terror transformation.

With Jinxes Master still around, Zhou Wen could still accept it. However, what the hell was that wretched Badlands? It actually fused with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

With Jinxes Master and Badlands, it’s like it’s afraid I won’t die from a single strike. It follows up with execution from a thousand cuts! Zhou Wen had the urge to euthanize the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

However, on second thought, Zhou Wen held back. After all, Jinxes Master probably included being poor. It didn’t matter if there was the additional Badlands.

In the past, Jinxes Master had no effect on him. It didn’t make sense that Badlands could do anything to him.

I’ll observe it first. If I really can’t withstand it, I’ll have to think of a way to euthanize it as soon as possible. Zhou Wen thought to himself and quickly unsummoned Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. He decided to try his best not to let it out.

At the same time, Zhou Wen summoned his baby tiger and got it to follow him, giving him some luck.

After doing all of this, Zhou Wen felt much more relaxed.

As he carefully continued on his way, Zhou Wen heightened his focus. Thankfully, nothing bad happened, allowing him to heave a sigh of relief.

Glimmer was much more difficult to evolve than Fine Dust. After walking for so long, Zhou Wen realized that although Glimmer was growing, its growth was very slow. At this rate, he didn’t know how many places he needed to visit to advance Glimmer to a Perfect Body.

The path Zhou Wen took was one that humans were still on; therefore, he didn’t encounter much danger.

On this day, Zhou Wen rode on the Great Might Vajra Bull and walked on a winding mountain road. At night, he had yet to walk out of the mountainous area. In front of him were unending mountains. The winding mountain roads were like snakes coiled around the mountain. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

As he walked, he suddenly saw many trucks parked on the road ahead. They looked like a convoy, but he didn’t know why they were parked there.

Typically, convoys would stop at a fixed service area. They wouldn’t usually stop on this mountain road in the middle of the night.

Behind the convoy were many soldiers in military uniforms. When they saw the Great Might Vajra Bull, they were shocked. Immediately, many soldiers ran over from the front of the army. Many soldiers raised their guns and aimed at the Great Might Vajra Bull.

When they saw Zhou Wen sitting on the Great Might Vajra Bull’s back, they heaved a sigh of relief. However, they didn’t let down their guard. The dozens of guns were still aimed at Zhou Wen and the Great Might Vajra Bull.

“We are the Federation’s transport team. Who are you?” The officer in the lead shouted at Zhou Wen from afar.

Zhou Wen didn’t rashly head over. He stopped the Great Might Vajra Bull and asked, “I’m a student of Sunset College. I’m preparing to rush back to Luoyang. What happened here?”

“For some reason, a large portion of the Panshan Road ahead has collapsed. Our vehicles can’t drive over, so we are trying to think of a solution. If you don’t have the ability to fly, I’m afraid you can only reroute,” the officer said.

“I have some flying abilities, but I can’t fly too far. Can you let me take a look?” Zhou Wen asked.

The officer discussed with the person beside him for a while before saying to Zhou Wen, “Alright, you can come over, but put away the Companion Beast first.”

Zhou Wen put away the Great Might Vajra Bull and walked over with Ya’er in his arms.

“It’s already very dangerous for a student like you to take mountain paths at night. Why are you carrying a child?” the officer said as he looked at Ya’er in Zhou Wen’s arms.

Perhaps it was because of a girl like Ya’er that they were willing to let Zhou Wen approach the convoy.

“Bad things are happening to this world. Her parents are gone, so I can only take her to school,” Zhou Wen said.

The soldiers revealed looks of sympathy, and the atmosphere eased a lot.

“This world... Sigh...” The officer sighed and led Zhou Wen forward.

Indeed, a large portion of the mountain road ahead was blocked. It was estimated that several hundred meters of the mountain road had collapsed. The Epic experts in the operations team were using their flying pets to slowly transport the goods and vehicles separately.

However, as there were only three flying pets working, the goods that could be transported at once were very limited, so the progress was very slow.

Zhou Wen looked at the broken mountain road and couldn’t help but frown.

The mountain road had almost completely collapsed. Even the mountain wall had collapsed. Zhou Wen looked at it for a while and felt that they had not collapsed naturally, nor did they look like they had been smashed by something heavy. It was more like something had bitten into them.
