Chapter 1510 Danger

A few soldiers in charge of sentry duty were surrounding a bonfire on the roof and cooking with metal basins.

A young man held a hard pancake in his hand. He used his hand to break it into small pieces before soaking them in a bowl of boiling water. As he ate, he asked the middle-aged man beside him, “Old Gang, how long do you think we have to endure days like this?”

Old Gang said, “Don’t read too much into it. If Zhou Wen hadn’t come here, Guide City would have long fallen. There wouldn’t even be food to eat.”

“Of course I know that this is already the best situation, but we can’t continue like this. My parents and sister live in a temporary building. If a dimensional creature rushes in, the consequences will be unimaginable,” the young man said.

Old Gang sighed and said, “There’s nothing we can do about that. I heard that other places use dimensional zones as natural barriers to build human cities, but the dimensional zones in Guide City are too strange. Where do you think we can build a city?”

“That’s true… What’s that?” The young man suddenly exclaimed in surprise.

The few soldiers hurriedly got to their feet and looked into the distance. They saw ghosts on the streets in the distance. There seemed to be countless wraiths wandering around as they approached.

“Are my eyes playing tricks on me?” Old Gang rubbed his eyes and realized in horror that a ferocious ghost was already in front of him. He fell back in fright.

The ferocious ghost followed like a shadow and pounced at Old Gang.

“Old Gang!” The young soldier beside him summoned his Companion Beast saber and slashed at the ferocious ghost.

However, the steel saber transformed from a Companion Beast slashed across the ferocious ghost’s body without any obstruction. It was as though the ferocious ghost was only an illusion.

The ferocious ghost pounced on Old Gang and immediately vanished. However, Old Gang’s eyes changed. His eyes glowed red. It was terrifyingly strange. His body was like a puppet as he stood up straight.

“Old Gang… What’s wrong…” Before the young man could figure out what had happened to Old Gang, ghosts landed.

The few soldiers brandished their weapons with all their might, but they were unable to injure the ghosts. Soon, they were pounced on by the ghosts and behaved strangely like Old Gang It wasn’t just that. There were wandering ghosts everywhere in Guide City. They rushed to Guide High School from all directions, and anyone they encountered was quickly possessed by them. “What the hell are these… Ah…” There were screams everywhere. In a short period of time, all hell had broken loose in Guide City.

The dimensional creatures on Mount Mandang had special attributes. They were pure souls. Typical attacks didn’t seem to have any effect on them. In a short period of time, a large number of people were possessed as they charged towards Guide High School with the legion of ghosts. The troops in charge of suppressing the ancient city were also possessed by ghosts. Not only did they stop suppressing the skeleton legion, but they also charged towards the city they were guarding.

The skeleton legion rushed out and wreaked havoc on the ground again.

At the top of an abandoned building, Berserker Immortal and company were admiring the dance of the monsters. The city was filled with screams and explosions.

“It’s difficult for ordinary powers to injure soul-type creatures. Although the levels of these soul-type creatures aren’t very high, it’s not that easy to destroy them. Furthermore, it will be even more difficult to destroy them after being possessed. Unless Zhou Wen is willing to kill the humans that have been possessed…” Painting Immortal said with a smile.

Zither Immortal added, “Originally, just these soul-type creatures were enough to leave Zhou Wen in a terrible fix. Now that the Calamity-grade white snake has appeared, even if Zhou Wen can withstand it, Guide City will definitely fall. Hundreds of thousands of people will be possessed by wandering ghosts, turning them into monsters that are neither human nor ghost. When the time comes, Your Excellency will appear to save them. Zhou Wen will have no choice but to yield.”

Berserker Immortal said indifferently, “To make a person like Zhou Wen serve me, this isn’t enough. I need greater pressure to completely destroy his psychological defense.”

“Do you plan on taking action personally?” Chess Immortal asked in surprise.

“Not yet. Just y’all are enough.” Although Berserker Immortal felt that Zhou Wen wasn’t someone ordinary humans could compare with, it wasn’t to the point of him personally taking action.

From Berserker Immortal’s point of view, Wang Mingyuan was worth him taking action. After all, Zhou Wen was only Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. The strength of any one immortal was enough to suppress him.

“Perhaps there’s no need for us to do anything. Just those soul-type creatures and the white snake are enough to make Zhou Wen collapse,” Calligraphy Immortal said as he looked at the burning city. Tens of thousands of people had already been possessed by wandering ghosts. At this rate, the entire Guide City would fall in less than an hour. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and company had already rushed out from Guide High School. They were alarmed when they saw the wandering ghosts everywhere on the streets.

Seeing a few wandering ghosts rush over, Feng Qiuyan drew his saber and slashed. His saber wasn’t an ordinary saber, but his Life Soul. This strike sliced through the ghosts, dissipating their souls. A dimensional crystal dropped.

Ming Xiu’s sword also stabbed at one of the ghosts, but it passed through its body without injuring it.

“These are soul-type creatures. Typical physical attacks are useless.” Zhou Wen had seen such creatures before. They were basically pure spirit bodies. Physical attacks were useless.

Truth Listener and Chick were best at dealing with such creatures. Unfortunately, Truth Listener was still in earring form and couldn’t be released. Chick was also evolving, so it wasn’t able to be used anytime soon.

However, even without Truth Listener and Chick, it wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen to deal with these soul-type creatures. What really worried Zhou Wen was the people who had been possessed by ghosts.

Their bodies were controlled by the ghosts as they attacked their family. They were in a dilemma as to whether to kill them or not.

Due to the lack of defensive barriers, Guide City had fallen too quickly. There were too many people possessed by ghosts. This was a thorny issue.

“Old Zhou, these dimensional creatures are too f*cking annoying… The Zhang family is best at dealing with these things… But it’s too late to hire them now…” Li Xuan’s physical attacks weren’t of much use against the ghosts. All he could do was use Planet Devourer to devour them.

However, there were too many people here. Many people had been possessed by ghosts, and Li Xuan couldn’t devour them all. It would be too troublesome to find the ghosts one by one.

It was even more troublesome with the possessed ones. Li Xuan was thrown into a dilemma.

With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned Great Brahma.

The Terror-form Great Brahma appeared behind Zhou Wen like a four-faced, eight-armed Buddha. He was as huge as a mountain.

Great Brahma had four sides. There was no sadness or joy on the front, and the back was enveloped by a black hole. The left side smiled meaningfully, while the right side wore a look of pity.
