With a flash of the saber beam, the Demonized General was cleaved into two.

The girl barely survived. When she saw Zhou Wen beside the Demonized General, she revealed a look of pleasant surprise.

“Didn’t I tell you that you lack strength and that you need to raise your strength before you can attempt killing the Demonized General?” Zhou Wen said with a frown. He was a little angry and his tone was nasty.

The reason Zhou Wen was angry wasn’t that the girl hadn’t listened to him. In the event something happened to the girl, wasn’t he harming her by teaching those movement techniques?

When the girl heard Zhou Wen, she lowered her head and said uneasily, “I’m sorry. It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have ignored your advice.”

“It’s not that you let me down, but that you let yourself down. You were lucky that I happened to be here. You might not be so lucky next time,” Zhou Wen said.

“Senior, don’t worry. There won’t be a next time,” the girl said seriously.

“That’s good. I’ll escort you back to prevent any accidents.” Zhou Wen walked out as the girl followed behind him.

“Your movement technique isn’t bad. Here are some movement technique notes. You can take a look. They should be of some help to you.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and handed a notebook to the girl.

They were some of the notes Zhou Wen had made when he first comprehended Transcendent Flying Immortal Skill. They were just random thoughts and techniques, nothing systematic.

After Zhou Wen truly gained an epiphany, he didn’t use them again.

This girl was rather talented in movement techniques, and her personality was somewhat similar to Zhou Wen’s. Zhou Wen casually handed the notebook to her to see if she could figure out anything useful from his random thoughts and techniques. It all depended on her perceptivity.

“I... I don’t have money...” The girl shook her hand immediately.

“It’s not worth much. I just wrote it in passing. Just take a look. There’s no need to take it seriously.” Zhou Wen threw the notebook to the girl and left.

After Zhou Wen returned to his dorm, he began studying which dimensional zone to continue grinding for invisible sinflames.

Although he already knew the method needed to advance Slaughterer, killing a Guardian to advance Slaughterer was just too difficult.

Zhou Wen already knew that he couldn’t beat the Guardian in Ant City.

He might not even be capable of killing the nine black dragons who pulled the wagon in the underground sea.

There was also another one—it was guarded by the chick’s mother. Ignoring the question of whether Zhou Wen could defeat it, even if he could, he didn’t think it was right to kill the chick’s mother.

Of course, he might not be its match in the first place.

After some thought, he realized that there was only one Guardian he could kill—Grim Demon who possessed the demonic sword.

Every time Grim Demon saw Zhou Wen, it felt that Zhou Wen was looking at him with a look resembling how a hungry wolf looked at a sheep. It made his heart tremble.

Although Zhou Wen had the intention to kill Grim Demon in an attempt to advance Slaughterer to another level, Grim Demon was Demonic Neonate’s reserve rations. Zhou Wen couldn’t bring himself to do the deed, so he could only give up. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Furthermore, Demonic Neonate’s successful sneak attack during the Buddha Annihilation battle was all thanks to Grim Demon who was attached to the demonic sword. Otherwise, the ordinary demonic sword wouldn’t have been able to injure Buddha Annihilation, much less kill it.

If he killed Grim Demon, Demonic Neonate’s might would be greatly reduced. It didn’t seem worth it.

After much selection, Zhou Wen finally chose a dimensional zone that few people went to. It was the underground Pool City. In the past, Zhou Wen had farmed dimensional creatures like the Poison Wyrm. There were actually quite a number of dimensional creatures there, but because most of them were underwater and weren’t easy to kill, very few people went there.

Zhou Wen went to Pool City and grinded for a few days, but he didn’t make much progress. Typical dimensional creatures had very few invisible sinflames on them. Furthermore, after advancing to the Holy Hell King, the invisible sinflames he needed for another advancement seemed to increase significantly. He didn’t know how long it would take to advance Holy Hell King by killing ordinary dimensional creatures.

Where can I kill a few dimensional creatures like the monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird? Zhou Wen finally gave up on the idea of grinding ordinary dungeons to obtain the invisible sinflames.

Zhou Wen returned to his dorm and found Li Xuan sitting in the living room. Seeing Zhou Wen return, Li Xuan walked over with a smile and was about to put his hand on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.

Whoosh!

Zhou Wen immediately placed the sheathed Bamboo Blade against Li Xuan’s neck. He asked coldly, “Who are you?”

“Old Zhou, are you crazy? Don’t you even recognize me?” As Li Xuan spoke, he was about to touch Zhou Wen’s forehead.

The Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand slashed at Li Xuan’s neck.

Boom!

Before the Bamboo Blade struck Li Xuan’s neck, white smoke emitted from his body, causing Zhou Wen’s Bamboo Blade to miss.

After the white smoke dissipated, he saw a woman standing there. She looked at Zhou Wen in surprise and said, “How did you discover that I’m not Li Xuan? I believe even Li Xuan himself wouldn’t be able to see through it.”

“I’ll give you one last chance. Who are you?” Zhou Wen stared coldly at the woman as he tightened his grip on the scabbard. He wouldn’t use a sheathed saber for the next strike.

Zhou Wen had not noticed any flaws. The woman impersonating Li Xuan was indeed enough to make it look real. Even if she was placed beside the real Li Xuan, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been able to tell which was real and which was fake.

However, women shouldn’t have come here. This was because Li Xuan didn’t dare enter his dorm randomly when Zhou Wen wasn’t around, much less sit on the sofa so daringly.

This was because Li Xuan knew very well that it was the antelope’s territory. What he was most afraid of was the antelope. Every time he came, he would only sit on a small sofa or a stool.

Therefore, Zhou Wen only needed a glance to know that this Li Xuan was fake.

“My name is Butterfly. I’m Second Young Master Li Mobai’s servant. Master wants me to invite you over,” the woman said.

“Is this your idea of an invitation?” Zhou Wen said with a cold expression.

“That’s because the Master said that I definitely can’t fool you. I didn’t believe it, so I made a bet with him. Now that I’ve lost, you can kill me now if you’re not satisfied. I have no complaints,” Butterfly closed her eyes and said.

“Why is Li Mobai looking for me?” Zhou Wen didn’t have the habit of killing. Furthermore, he actually knew of Butterfly. When Li Xuan told him about Li Mobai and the Evil King Gu, he had told him about this woman.

Li Weiyang couldn’t tell even when Butterfly pretended to be Li Weiyang. He had nearly lost his will to live because of her ruse.

“Master has something important to discuss with you,” Butterfly said.

“Not interested. Leave,” Zhou Wen said.

“As the Master expected. However, Master got me to ask you if you are interested in Guardians? If you are interested, he will wait for you at Elegant Peace Restaurant,” Butterfly said.
