Chapter 939: Good Things Are Inbound For You

The building was indeed odd. It looked like a stone temple. The door to the stone temple was open, so it wasn’t appropriate for Zhou Wen to ride Torch Dragon in. When he arrived at the door, he summoned Torch Dragon again and walked into the stone temple step by step.

What kind of person is Emperor of Shang? Zhou Wen was extremely curious. Due to his excessive curiosity, his fatigue decreased significantly.

Due to Truth Listener’s ability, the range it could hear was very limited. Only when Zhou Wen walked into the stone temple did he roughly understand the situation inside.

What’s going on? Zhou Wen looked at the scene inside the ancient temple in disbelief.

There were many strange things placed in the stone temple. Zhou Wen didn’t know what most of them were for, but he recognized the red words of ‘joy’ often found at weddings.

Furthermore, on the pillars on both sides of the stone temple, there were words written about a ‘match made in heaven’ and ‘a happy ending.’ The layout of the entire ancient temple was completely different from what Zhou Wen had imagined.

If he didn’t know that Emperor of Shang was inside, Zhou Wen would have imagined that this was the ancient version of an Elder Moon Temple.

“May I know if the Imperial Lord is here? I was entrusted by an old friend in Deer Terrace Pavilion to bring a message.” After Zhou Wen entered the stone temple, he realized that his senses had recovered significantly. He could see and make sounds.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare mention the Nine-Tailed Fox’s name, so he could only say that it was an old friend.

“Come in.” A voice sounded from the hall.

Zhou Wen felt that the voice was very deep and masculine, so he walked into the hall.

He didn’t know what was so special about the stone temple. Even walking felt much easier. After walking into the hall, he saw a man sitting on a stone platform.

Typically, that was a spot meant to consecrate deities, but there were no statues there. There was only one person, and he was a real human.

Is this the famous tyrant? Has he really lived to this day? Zhou Wen looked at the man on the stone platform in disbelief.

The man was completely different from the King Zhou of Shang that Zhou Wen had imagined. He didn’t have a tall, stocky figure, nor did he have a domineering aura. He looked like a very quiet man. He was handsome and didn’t have a thin figure. He was slender and muscular, giving him a refined aura.

If he met this person outside, Zhou Wen believed that he was a young and promising professor. He definitely wouldn’t believe that he was a tyrant.

Emperor of Shang sat on the stone platform in a very comfortable posture. One of his hands rested on his knee while the other held a flask of alcohol. He drank without looking at Zhou Wen and said casually, “What message did she get you to bring?”

“Sorry, I need to confirm that you are Emperor of Shang,” Zhou Wen asked.

Emperor of Shang looked up at him. “Since you are able to come here, don’t you know that I’m the only prisoner here?”

“She told me to pass you the message: think not.” Zhou Wen hurriedly conveyed the Nine-Tailed Fox’s words to the Emperor of Shang.

“Think not... Think not... ‘Think not’ indeed...” Emperor of Shang suddenly laughed loudly, looking extremely carefree. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After Emperor of Shang finished laughing, Zhou Wen said, “The message has been delivered. It’s time for me to bid you farewell to report to her.”

“Wait.” Emperor of Shang stopped Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen stopped in puzzlement and looked at him. Emperor of Shang extended his hand and threw something at Zhou Wen. “This is my reward for you. Help me pass a message to her as well.”

“Imperial Lord, please speak.” Zhou Wen saw that the item that the Emperor of Shang had thrown at him was a palm-sized stone tablet. The stone tablet had the red word “joy” engraved on it. Apart from that, there was nothing else. He didn’t know what it was for.

“Wait,” the Emperor of Shang said.

“What?” Zhou Wen was momentarily taken aback.

“Wait,” the Emperor of Shang repeated.

Only then did Zhou Wen react. He looked at Emperor of Shang and asked, “You want me to pass her the word: wait? Actually, you can say more.”

“There’s no need. Go back. Your human body shouldn’t stay in the dimension for too long,” Emperor of Shang said indifferently.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to leave, feeling extremely puzzled.

Emperor of Shang was completely different from what he had imagined. Furthermore, the place he resided was somewhat different from what Zhou Wen had imagined.

If Emperor of Shang was a prisoner, the place that imprisoned him was like child’s play. There wasn’t even a guard. It looked like he was alone, and he didn’t see anything that restrained him.

Furthermore, an ordinary human like him could enter and leave as he pleased. It didn’t seem like a prison.

“Is everything done?” the ice maiden asked when she saw Zhou Wen come out.

“It’s done.” Zhou Wen wanted to say something, but after leaving the stone temple, he returned to his previous state. He couldn’t make a sound and could only write.

“What did he say?” the ice maiden asked again.

“He didn’t say anything. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come out so quickly.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to tell the ice maiden about the message Emperor of Shang wanted him to pass.

The ice maiden curled her lips and said, “You don’t have to be nervous. I’m not trying to pry into his secrets. In fact, he doesn’t have any secrets.”

“Then let’s go. We have to hurry back. We don’t have much time left.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he summoned Torch Dragon again. Just as he was about to put away the stone tablet and leave, the ice maiden grabbed his hand.

“What’s this?” The ice maiden pulled up Zhou Wen’s hand that was holding the stone tablet and stared intently at it.

“A stone tablet. What else can it be?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised, unsure why the ice maiden had such a huge reaction.

“Did Emperor of Shang give it to you?” The ice maiden’s gaze remained fixed on the stone tablet.

“Yes, do you know what this is?” Zhou Wen thought to himself. From the looks of it, the stone tablet that Emperor of Shang gave me seems to be something good. Don’t tell me that the ice maiden wants to snatch it from me?

As Zhou Wen thought about it, the ice maiden released her hand and looked at him with an odd expression. “Of course I know. I’m afraid everyone in the dimension knows.”

“Oh, so this stone tablet has a great background. What’s its use?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

The ice maiden suddenly smiled and said, “Why should I tell you? It’s fine if you want to know, but that depends on whether you pay the price.”

“Forget it.” Zhou Wen put away the stone tablet and rode Torch Dragon.

Since many people in the dimension knew about it, there was no need for him to ask the ice maiden. He could just ask The Thearch when he returned.

Thinking nothing of it, the ice maiden said without head or tail, “Good things are inbound for you.” She led the way and took Zhou Wen back to the ice castle.

Zhou Wen kept thinking about what the ice maiden meant by “good things are inbound for you,” but he couldn’t figure it out.
