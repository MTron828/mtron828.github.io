Chapter 1326: Loss of Luck

Translator: CKtalon

Wang Lu reached out and swatted away the Guardian’s hand. She said calmly, “I said that I won’t contract with you. Not in the past, not now, and not in the future.”

The Guardian didn’t flare up. She retracted her hand and said with a smile, “Don’t forget that you’re not an ordinary person. It’s very difficult for others to injure you, but once you’re injured, it’s very difficult for you to recover. No external force can treat you. You can only rely on your own body to slowly recover.”

“It will eventually recover,” Wang Lu said.

“That’s right. Although your injuries are very serious, they still won’t take your life. Given time, you’ll eventually recover.” The Guardian’s eyes gradually narrowed. “However, you’ve probably never been injured before. You don’t know much about what will happen after you’re injured. Then let me tell you. After you’re injured, your luck will decrease. With your current injuries, your luck might have already reached a nadir.”

“Do you want to take the opportunity to kill me? Then do it,” Wang Lu said nonchalantly.

“Baby, how can I bear to kill you? If I kill you, where can I find another human like you to contract with? There probably isn’t a second human in this world who is more suitable to contract with me than you.” The Guardian’s expression gradually turned cold. “But without your luck to suppress your sister’s power of misfortune, she will produce the expected effects. With me aiding her, I’m afraid the Wang family will only have the two of you left remaining. Wouldn’t that be fun?”

Wang Lu’s expression changed. She didn’t know that her luck would greatly weaken after she was injured because this was unprecedented.

If the Guardian strengthened Wang Chan’s power of misfortune as she claimed, the Wang family might really suffer a calamity. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Do you think I’ll believe you?” Wang Lu forced herself to calm down.

Perhaps the Guardian was just bluffing. There was no such thing as having her luck drop because of an injury.

“You don’t believe me?” The Guardian flicked a coin into Wang Lu’s hand and said, “Try flipping it ten times. Under normal circumstances, you should be able to get tails ten times in a row, right? Let me see how many times you can get tails. Five or six times? With your injuries, six times should be your limit, I suppose?”

Wang Lu caught the coin and took a look. Then, she flipped it into the air. When she caught it, she realized that it wasn’t heads, but the number “1”.

“Heh heh, looks like your luck is much lower than I thought.” The Guardian smiled.

Wang Lu’s expression changed as she flipped the coin again. She wanted to get tails, but when the coin landed, it was still 1.

Wang Lu flipped the coin a few times, but she didn’t get a single tails. All she got was 1.

The Guardian sighed and said, “Even I miscalculated. I didn’t expect your sister’s power of misfortune to be so strong. Now that your luck has weakened, her power of misfortune is sufficient to suppress your luck because of her existence. Perhaps Wang Chan’s power can completely bury your Wang family even without my help.”

Wang Lu’s expression was extremely ugly. She knew that the Guardian was right. Wang Chan’s power of misfortune had escalated so quickly that it exceeded everyone’s expectations.

When her luck was still present, she couldn’t sense it. Now that her luck had greatly weakened, Wang Chan’s power of misfortune appeared.

“You have no other choice. Sign a contract with me and, using my power, restore your body. You can suppress Wang Chan’s power of misfortune and return everything to normal. Otherwise, even if Wang Chan’s power isn’t enough to destroy the Wang family, I will help her…” The Guardian was like the devil. Her words were as tempting as the abyss.

Wang Lu’s expression was colored by different emotions. She was momentarily unable to make a decision.

Suddenly, shouts came from the Wang family’s courtyard. It seemed like there was a fire somewhere. The fire was very strong, and soon, thick smoke could be seen rising into the sky from the garden.

“What a potent power of misfortune. It took effect so quickly.” The Guardian looked at Wang Lu and continued, “Actually, I’ve never understood why you aren’t willing to contract with me.”

“The Guardian contract is an equal contract. I won’t affect your body or hinder your life. However, with my strength, you can do many things that you couldn’t do in the past. The contract is only beneficial to you…”

Wang Lu bit her lip and didn’t answer. However, when she heard the various shouts coming from the Wang family’s yard, her eyes gradually lost their firmness.

The Guardian struck while the iron was hot and continued, “Now, if you humans want to become true powerhouses, there aren’t more than three paths. Use the Mythical Serum or fuse with a Guardian. The two are actually similar. They will make you half-human. If you want to keep your human body, contracting with me is undoubtedly the best choice.”

“No, there’s another way,” said Wang Lu.

“Oh, what path?” the Guardian asked.

“Advance to the Mythical stage as a human,” Wang Lu said.

The Guardian laughed. “What a joke. You humans have innately flawed bodies. It’s impossible for you to advance to the Mythical stage. Advancing to the Mythical stage as a human only exists in the imagination of humans. You don’t really think that’s possible, do you?”

“It’s not an imagination on my part, but I’m sure it can be done. This is because humans have already advanced to the Mythical stage through their own abilities,” Wang Lu said.

“Are you talking about Human Sovereign? It’s unknown if Human Sovereign is a pure human, but I’m guessing that he definitely isn’t. At most, he’s half-human, half-Guardian like Ya.” As the Guardian walked towards Wang Lu, she said with a smile, “Instead of having unrealistic dreams, why don’t you spend some time thinking about how to resolve the problem in front of you? I’m your only choice.”

“I…” Wang Lu wanted to say something, but she was interrupted by a voice.

“I think it’s good to dream. What if it comes true?” A figure appeared out of thin air in front of Wang Lu, blocking the Guardian who was about to reach her.

“Zhou Wen… Why are you…” Although she could only see his back, Wang Lu still recognized him at a glance.

“I naturally have to settle the trouble I caused.” In the past, Zhou Wen might have been fooled by Wang Lu, but as Truth Listener’s strength increased, Wang Lu’s bluff in front of him had been betrayed by her strong inner voice.

It was only because Zhou Wen had heard her thoughts and knew that her injuries couldn’t be treated by external forces that he didn’t immediately treat Wang Lu. He never expected such a thing to happen.

“I’m afraid you can’t handle the trouble here..” The Guardian looked at Zhou Wen and curled her lips. “You probably don’t know who I am, right?”
