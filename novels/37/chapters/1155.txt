Chapter 1156: Greetings Prince Consort

At night, An Sheng came over to invite Zhou Wen and Ya’er to the meal held at the front hall.

Tsukuyomi followed Zhou Wen the entire time, so he had no choice but to take her along.

Before the group reached the front hall, they saw a golden stream of light fly out and instantly appear in front of Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen extended his arm and saw a strange golden-feathered bird land on it. It was Chick.

However, Chick’s body now resembled a huge eagle. Its body was also very similar in shape, leaving Zhou Wen puzzled. He thought to himself, How strange. Isn’t it a descendant of a phoenix? Why does it look more and more like an eagle?

However, being able to reunite with Chick delighted Zhou Wen. He reached out to stroke Chick’s feathers and vaguely felt a heat flowing beneath them.

Chick intimately extended its head and rubbed against Zhou Wen’s body. It didn’t feel unfamiliar despite the five years of separation.

Zhou Wen still didn’t understand why the phoenix had chosen him to deal with Chick.

After entering the front hall, Zhou Wen saw the antelope lazily sprawled on the sofa without approaching the dining table.

At the dining table, An Tianzuo sat at the main seat with An Jing sitting on his right.

Having not seen her for so many years, An Jing’s appearance was very different from before. She was now as tall as Zhou Wen.

Without the baby fat on her face, she looked even more heroic. Furthermore, she looked much more composed. She sat with a straight back, a clear indication of a soldier’s bearing.

An Tianzuo and An Jing looked at Zhou Wen without a word.

“Young Master Wen, sit here.” An Sheng got Zhou Wen to sit on An Tianzuo’s left. Ya’er sat beside Zhou Wen. An Sheng had planned on arranging for Tsukuyomi to sit on An Jing’s side, but Tsukuyomi sat down beside Ya’er.

An Sheng had no choice but to walk to An Jing’s side and sit down. Then, he said to Zhou Wen, “Young Master Wen, why don’t you introduce this beautiful lady to us?”

“Her name is Tsukuyomi. She’s a friend I met overseas.” Zhou Wen found it odd because An Sheng had previously said that he should be able to see the person impersonating him tonight, but there was only An Tianzuo and An Jing here.

It’s definitely impossible for An Tianzuo. Could it be that the person impersonating me was An Jing? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but glance at An Jing.

An Jing happened to be looking at him as well. When their eyes met, the two of them subconsciously looked away, feeling uncomfortable.

“Miss Tsukuyomi, are you from overseas? Which island do you live on?” An Tianzuo asked Tsukuyomi.

“Bride Island,” Tsukuyomi answered truthfully. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Bride Island?” An Tianzuo frowned slightly as he sized up Tsukuyomi.

Clearly, he knew what kind of place Bride Island was and knew that it was impossible for humans to live there.

Zhou Wen was afraid that An Tianzuo would continue asking, so he explained, “Bride Island isn’t as terrifying as the legends say. I’ve been there and seen the Ghost Parade...”

Zhou Wen’s topic immediately piqued An Sheng’s interest. “I heard that the Ghost Parade disaster has appeared overseas. A Calamity creature should have appeared, but for some reason, there was no news all of a sudden. Young Master Wen, since you’ve been there, do you know what happened?”

An Jing and An Tianzuo also looked at Zhou Wen. Clearly, they also wanted to know the answer.

Zhou Wen naturally knew what had happened, but he couldn’t tell them in front of Tsukuyomi that he had abducted the newly born Calamity creature, so the dimensional creatures that accompanied her had temporarily ended up settling down.

“Actually, it’s just a rumor. Calamity creatures aren’t as terrifying as the outside world described them to be. They are still very kind and reasonable. They are also very amiable. I reasoned with them, and they probably felt that what I said made sense, so they stopped their parade.” With Tsukuyomi beside him, he could only speak against his conscience.

Otherwise, if he angered Tsukuyomi, Luoyang would probably be doomed.

An Tianzuo, An Jing, and An Sheng looked at him. The look in their eyes said everything. They felt that Zhou Wen was spouting nonsense.

Reason with a Calamity creature? Very kind and amiable. It would be a miracle if they believed it.

An Jing said indifferently, “If they are so kind and nice, why didn’t you invite them back as guests?”

What do you mean by not inviting them? Isn’t one just beside me? Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he said, “It’s too far. The journey’s rough, so I’ll see if there’s a chance in the future.”

An Jing curled her lips and didn’t say anything else. Clearly, she felt that Zhou Wen was bullsh*tting.

An Sheng hurriedly tried to smooth things over. “Overseer, the food is ready. Why don’t we get them to serve the dishes now?”

An Tianzuo nodded slightly as An Sheng hurriedly instructed someone to serve the food.

It was a great spread, but it wasn’t extravagant. The most expensive food was probably the dessert that Ya’er ate. The rest were ordinary home-cooked dishes, but they were made exquisitely.

The atmosphere was especially tense as they ate together.

An Tianzuo ate a few mouthfuls, put down his bowl and chopsticks, and asked Tsukuyomi, “Miss Tsukuyomi, you live on Bride Island. Have you seen the Ghost Parade with your own eyes?”

“Of course,” Tsukuyomi answered.

“I wonder which are the hundred ghosts in the parade. Please broaden my horizons,” An Tianzuo said.

“Although the Ghost Parade is known as having a hundred ghosts, there are actually more than a hundred of them. Just at the Terror grade, there are already more than a hundred. For example, Great Daitengu, Yuki Onna, and Hashihime are all at the Terror grade,” Tsukuyomi answered.

“You are really lucky to escape alive with so many Terror creatures there.” An Jing clearly didn’t believe Tsukuyomi’s words.

“Didn’t Zhou Wen already say that the dimensional creatures there are very kind and amiable? We get along very well, like we’re friends. There’s no need to flee, right?” Tsukuyomi’s last sentence was directed at Zhou Wen.

“Yes, they are especially friendly. They are really kind. We are all friends.” What else could Zhou Wen say? All he could do was echo Tsukuyomi.

“Then you should invite them back next time. Let us meet these amiable friends,” An Jing said casually.

“There’s no need to wait. I can introduce you to them now,” Tsukuyomi said.

An Jing felt that there was no point in continuing. Just as she was about to end the topic, the lights in the hall suddenly went off.

It wasn’t just the living room. The entire An family residence sank into darkness as all the lights were extinguished.

An Jing and An Sheng’s expressions changed. Just as they were about to get up, An Tianzuo said calmly, “Sit down.”

An Jing and An Sheng had no choice but to sit down again. However, just as they sat down, a cold wind blew open the door to the living room. Snowflakes swept in with the cold wind. At the same time, a woman in white floated in.

“Yuki Onna?” An Sheng and An Jing stared at Yuki Onna. They had already guessed her identity, but they still found it unbelievable.

Yuki Onna walked to Tsukuyomi’s side and bowed slightly at Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen. “Your Majesty, Prince Consort. Greetings from your subject, Yuki Onna.”
