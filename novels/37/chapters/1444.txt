Chapter 1445: Gifts from the Gods

“My head is spinning…” Liu Yun felt dizzy. His legs seemed to go limp and he couldn’t stand properly.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he heard a boom. The crystal chandelier above him turned into a 7.

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan exchanged looks as their expressions turned solemn.

It was difficult to come up with a countermeasure in advance without knowing what the countdown meant.

I’ll deal with those flower trees first.?Zhou Wen held the golden revolver and shot at the flowers that the Death Harbinger Crow didn’t caw at. A few bullets penetrated them.

Liu Yun was a little dizzy from the curse. His nose was still bleeding, so he couldn’t afford to snatch the items.

The flowers fell and transformed into different shapes that headed for Zhou Wen.

One of them looked like a necklace, while another looked like a ring. He couldn’t tell what the other four were, but their shapes were rather strange.

The first petal to fall was a flower that Zhou Wen couldn’t identify. After the petal fell, there was a stream of water inside.

The water immediately drilled into Zhou Wen’s body upon contact and spread throughout his body. Zhou Wen felt as though all his cells had been cleansed by holy water as they emitted shocking vitality.

Does this enhance my physique??Zhou Wen immediately realized that this wasn’t a Companion Beast, but something that strengthened his physique. Even without looking at the game’s data, he could sense that his physique had greatly improved.

Following that, the necklace and ring flew out of the petal, turning into streams of light that left a tattoo on Zhou Wen’s body.

Another two Calamity-grade Companion Beasts!?Zhou Wen nearly cried out in happiness. These were Calamity-grade Companion Beasts, not run-of-the-mill items. Having obtained four Calamity-grade Companion Beasts at once, the number of Calamity-grade Companion Beasts on Earth combined probably wasn’t as many as his alone.

Just as Zhou Wen was feeling excited, the remaining three flowers opened one by one. The items inside flew towards him.

The three items were a blob of white gas, a crystal slice, and a water droplet.

Could those things enhance Essence Energy, Speed, and Strength??Previously, the water had strengthened his physique. Now, there were three things he couldn’t identify. Zhou Wen felt that it was very likely to enhance the other three attributes.

As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the three items had already landed on him and fused into his body.

However, to Zhou Wen’s surprise, after the three items fused into his body, his Essence Energy, Strength, and Speed didn’t increase, nor did he obtain any Companion Beasts.

Instead, he felt some strange characteristics appear on his body. After the water droplet fused into his body, Zhou Wen immediately produced a strange fragrance.

Zhou Wen only found the fragrance nice. It was fragrant, but not overwhelming. It was thick and not cloying, but he didn’t know what use it had.

After the crystal slice entered his body, it immediately transformed into two strange energy streams that flowed to his eyes. Zhou Wen felt his eyes turn cool, but his vision didn’t improve.

The white gas was the strangest. After entering Zhou Wen’s body, it quickly fused into him and vanished without a trace. Zhou Wen didn’t sense any changes in his body.

“Holy sh*t… Old Zhou… Amazing…” Just as Zhou Wen was wondering what the effects of the three items were, he heard Li Xuan shout.

“What’s amazing?” Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan.

“Old Zhou, why do you look so beautiful all of a sudden? Your eyes look like they can hook people… If you were a woman… I might have married you…” Li Xuan said as he swallowed.

“What the hell are you talking about!” Zhou Wen suddenly realized that something was amiss.

This was because Su Yi and the cursed Liu Yun were staring intently at him. Their eyes were like lechers who had seen a beauty, giving Zhou Wen a fright.

“No good!” Zhou Wen exclaimed. He immediately took out a mirror from the chaos space and looked at himself.

At a glance, Zhou Wen nearly failed to recognize himself in the mirror.

The first impression the person in the mirror gave him was that he was fair and beautiful. In particular, his eyes had an indescribable charm that made one take a second glance. Those with poor self-restraint would find it difficult to move their gaze away from him.

Zhou Wen immediately understood what the three items were for. The gifts the gods had given Pandora were for her to seduce Prometheus’s younger brother.

Therefore, other than the precious divine artifacts, the gifts given to her by the gods were also gifts like temptation, fragrance, wisdom, curiosity, and so on.

Zhou Wen had already guessed that the drop of water was definitely the aphrodisiac perfume from the Goddess of Love and Beauty. The crystal slice likely gave his eyes some special charm.

Although he couldn’t figure out what the white gas was, it definitely had some special effects.

If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have been greedy!?Zhou Wen regretted it. It was impossible to get those things out now.

On the other side, the way Su Yi and Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen made him shudder.

Thankfully, Li Xuan was rather special to begin with. The Essence Energy Art he cultivated was also rather special, so he wasn’t too affected. All he felt was that Zhou Wen had become better looking.

Boom!

The crystal chandelier changed again, turning into a number 6.

“Liu Yun, do you know what this crystal chandelier is?” Zhou Wen never believed Liu Yun’s words.

Zhou Wen didn’t believe that he would solely trust Jing Daoxian’s words, resulting in him spending so much effort and using so many means to enter the Pandora Temple without knowing anything. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Liu Yun was already a little confused due to the curse. Now, he was affected by Zhou Wen’s fragrance and charm. He stared intently at Zhou Wen and said in a daze, “I’m guessing that it’s the countdown to the opening of the magic box. If we can’t stop it before the countdown ends, the magic box might open. When that happens, everyone will die.”

“Why didn’t you say so earlier?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that there was no need to ask why. Therefore, he hurriedly asked, “Do you know how to stop the countdown?”

“I don’t know.” Liu Yun shook his head and looked at Zhou Wen with an even more infatuated look. Then, he added, “Junior Brother, don’t worry. Even if I die, I’ll protect you.”

Zhou Wen had goosebumps all over his body when he heard that. He had the urge to give him a headshot.

“Wen, it’s the same for me. Even if I have to sacrifice my life, I’ll protect you.” Su Yi also looked at Zhou Wen in a daze.

“Holy sh*t, Old Zhou, when did you learn the art of seduction? Even men are mesmerized?” Li Xuan was dumbfounded as he realized the problem with Zhou Wen.

“It’s all because of those things. Let’s not talk about this now. We have to quickly think of a way to stop the countdown.” Zhou Wen’s heart raced.
