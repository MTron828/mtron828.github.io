Chapter 1059: Moon Palace

Translator: CKtalon

In an instant, the fire enveloped Wei Ge, who was holding the Bone Pottery, turning him into a flaming man. The space suit instantly reduced to ashes.

Zhou Wen was given a fright as he immediately instructed Ice Maiden to save him. Her strength was most effective against fire-elemental attacks, but Ice Maiden didn’t move as she stared at Wei Ge.

Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss. On careful look, he saw that the flames had already flowed into Wei Ge’s body. The flames weren’t burning from the outside, but from the inside out.

Now, Wei Ge’s body was like a flaming man. It was as though flames had seeped into every inch of his cells. As for the Bone Pottery artifact in his hand, it had turned to ashes in the flames.

The corpse beside him also disintegrated. He didn’t go up in flames, but was reduced to ashes. This gave Zhou Wen a very bad feeling.

Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan also looked at Wei Ge in horror. Although the flames on Wei Ge’s body were terrifying, they didn’t hear him cry out in pain.

“I... am finally back...” The flames gradually converged into Wei Ge’s body. His body remained unharmed in the fire as he spoke.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t hear Wei Ge’s voice. His tone and intonation were completely different from Wei Ge’s.

“Who are you?” Zhou Wen stared at Wei Ge and asked.

Now, he regretted not stopping Wei Ge. Although the two of them hadn’t interacted much, they were schoolmates. Zhou Wen still felt somewhat uncomfortable seeing him being possessed by an unknown creature. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Who am I?” The flames on Wei Ge’s body had almost completely extinguished as he returned to his original appearance. Although his appearance hadn’t changed, for some reason, Zhou Wen felt that the present Wei Ge was completely different.

He looked up at the universe and said in a strange tone, “I’m not human.”

“What are you?” Zhou Wen looked at Wei Ge as countless thoughts flashed through his mind. He couldn’t think of any way to help Wei Ge retrieve his body.

“I’m human,” Wei Ge said slowly.

“Didn’t you say that you aren’t human?” Zhou Wen looked at him in puzzlement. He increasingly felt that Wei Ge was in danger. Not only was the thing attached to him a monster, but it was also a mentally ill monster.

Wei Ge didn’t answer Zhou Wen. He turned his head to look in the direction of Earth, but because this was the back of the Moon, he couldn’t see Earth.

“Is Earth still around?” Wei Ge asked Zhou Wen.

“Of course it’s still here, but we can’t see it from this side of the Moon.” Zhou Wen found it even stranger.

“That’s good. I should still be in time,” Wei Ge muttered to himself. As he spoke, he walked out.

“Where are you going?” Zhou Wen exchanged looks with Ice Maiden and followed him.

Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan hurriedly followed. Due to Wei Ge’s existence, the invisible dimensional creature didn’t attack them. If they were far away from him, they would probably be attacked again.

This existence that occupied Wei Ge’s “body” didn’t seem to be as offensive as the dimensional creature.

“Take back my Companion Beast,” Wei Ge said as he walked, as though he didn’t care about Zhou Wen and company.

He didn’t walk quickly, as though he was familiarizing himself with this body.

Wei Ge was already at the Epic stage, but Epic humans didn’t have the ability to survive on the Moon. However, now that he was walking naked on the Moon, it was as though he was walking as freely as back on Earth.

“Where is your Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen guessed the creature under the tree stump might be his Companion Beast.

If he could subdue it, their danger would be greatly reduced.

However, now that Wei Ge was possessed by him, Zhou Wen didn’t know if he could recover.

Thinking back to when Wei Ge left school, he had once said that he would find his life meaningful if he was lucky enough to barely defeat the heavens.

But now, he was already doomed without doing anything. He didn’t know if there would be a day when he could realize his value.

Wei Ge didn’t answer as he continued walking forward. He was walking in the direction where Zhou Wen and company had previously encountered the invisible creature.

“That Terror creature is retreating. It seems to be afraid of this person,” Ice Maiden whispered to Zhou Wen.

“Isn’t that Terror creature his Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen whispered.

“That’s a Terror-grade dimensional creature. It’s naturally impossible for it to be a Companion Beast.” Ice Maiden paused before saying, “This person seems very strong.”

“I also know that he’s very strong. Now, I just want to know if there’s any hope for Wei Ge to live?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I’m afraid it’s impossible to retrieve his body,” Ice Maiden answered firmly.

Soon, Wei Ge returned to the spot where the tree stump had been dug out. He stood in front of the huge hole and stared at it. A strange divine light shot out from his eyes like two divine lamps. When the light shone into the hole, a strange change immediately happened inside.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen and company saw a figure gradually condense in the hole. It was a huge dark-gold toad.

“In the legends of the East District, the Moon is also called Toad Palace. Legend has it that there’s a golden toad inside. Could it be that this is the legendary golden toad?” Shen Yuchi said as he stared at the golden toad.

Zhou Wen had roughly guessed that the one who had devoured the astronauts and inspectors was most likely the golden toad. However, he didn’t know what power Wei Ge had used to make the Terror creature show itself.

Soon, Zhou Wen realized that Wei Ge’s target wasn’t the golden toad. His gaze shone into the hole, revealing an ancient jade door where the mine’s wall originally stood.

The jade door was crystalline and emitted infinite coldness. Zhou Wen looked carefully and saw that on the plaque above the door’s brow were the words “Moon Palace.”

Holy sh*t, there’s really a Moon Palace. Could Chang’e and Moon Rabbit be inside? Zhou Wen was surprised when he swept his gaze across the corner of the plaque. His surprise turned into disbelief.

In the corner of the plaque was a tiny palm symbol. The tiny palm symbol held the moon symbol.

There’s actually a tiny palm symbol here! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. This was an unexpected gain.

Shen Yuchi and company also looked at Moon Palace in surprise. Although it wasn’t strange for mythical places to appear in this era, seeing the legendary Moon Palace still sent palpitations through their hearts. After all, the legend of Moon Palace was famous in the East District.

The divine light in Wei Ge’s eyes vanished as he slowly walked towards the Moon Palace. After taking a few steps, the golden toad opened its mouth and extended its python-like tongue towards Wei Ge.

Wei Ge extended his hand and beckoned. Flames immediately appeared in his hand, condensing into a flaming ax that severed the golden toad’s tongue.
