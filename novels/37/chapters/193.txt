Chapter 194 Car Flying Through The Empty Sky

“F*ck, is that a phoenix?” Li Xuan asked in surprise.

“Don’t speak, don’t move, don’t make any sound,” Ah Sheng said in a low voice.

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan felt a baffling sense of pressure when they saw Ah Sheng being so cautious. They sat in the car without daring to move, but their eyes were focused on the dancing giant bird in the mountains.

The giant bird flew very leisurely, like a golden cloud floating in the middle of a mountain. It leisurely bobbed up and down in the sky, like an elder taking a stroll.

After flying for a while, the giant bird approached Zhou Wen and company. Only then did Zhou Wen and Li Xuan see that behind the giant bird was a row of chicks.

The giant bird was like a golden cloud, but the chicks were about the size of a quail. Although their feathers were also golden, their color was lighter, and they didn’t have such a strong luster. Apparently, their feathers hadn’t fully grown.

Zhou Wen counted and found a total of six chicks followed behind the giant bird. They flapped their wings and tried their best to maintain their flying postures, but it was extremely strenuous. They flew in all directions, as though they could drop at any moment.

The giant bird ignored them and continued flying in front. The six chicks tried their best to follow the giant bird up and down as they flapped their wings with all their might.

This is the true descendant of a dimensional creature! This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen a dimensional creature’s descendant. A Companion Egg wasn’t a real egg, but a form of life crystal.

As they watched, the giant bird flew over with the chicks. When it was a few hundred meters away from the mountain path, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan felt a strong heat blast, as though a scorching wind was hitting them.

The sweat from their bodies intermediately oozed out. In a blink of an eye, their clothes were drenched.

Because of Ah Sheng’s reminder, neither of them dared make a sound. They sat in the car, as though they were in a sauna.

They were still somewhat worried, unsure if the giant bird was coming for them. Zhou Wen even wondered if their firm muscles had caught the fancy of the giant bird, making it decide to feed them to the chicks.

Li Xuan and Zhou Wen looked at Ah Sheng, hoping to ask him what ideas he had. They were no match for such a monstrous creature. If they didn’t flee now, it would be too late.

Ah Sheng sat there without any reaction. He looked at the giant bird without a word, evidently having no intention of escaping.

The two of them could only bite the bullet and sit still. After a while, the giant bird flew past the top of the mountain with the six chicks and ignored them. Clearly, they were only out practicing flying and weren’t intentionally targeting them.

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan secretly heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that the giant bird was about to fly over them.

However, it was at this moment that something unexpected happened.

An exhausted chick fell from the sky. Although it tried its best to flap its wings and control its body, it was unable to muster the required strength. It fell faster and faster.

And coincidentally, the chick fell in the direction of their car.

“What do we do?” Li Xuan and Zhou Wen looked at Ah Sheng.

Ah Sheng obviously hadn’t expected this to happen and the look on his face changed as well. However, he still sat motionlessly in the driver’s seat and even gestured for their silence.

The chick fell too quickly and just as Zhou Wen saw that Ah Sheng wasn’t moving, the chick had already fallen on the roof of the car. With a loud thud, a huge dent was produced on the roof.

Furthermore, a tiny hole had smashed through the roof. The chick’s head and neck drooped down from the tiny hole as it shook in front of Zhou Wen and Li Xuan.

Instantly, the air in the car seemed to freeze. Li Xuan robotically turned his head and exchanged a glance with Zhou Wen, seeing their worry in each other’s eyes.

This chick won’t die here, right? Zhou Wen was very worried. If the chick really died here, would the giant bird vent its anger on them?

Dimension creatures weren’t humans, so they wouldn’t reason with them. They could thank their lucky heavens if they weren’t eaten by them, much less think about being given compensation for the car damage. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Just as Zhou Wen was considering whether he should immediately jump out of the car to flee, he saw the chick’s neck twitch before opening its eyes. It then looked at Zhou Wen and Li Xuan for a few seconds.

Following that, they heard thumping sounds. The car’s roof which was made of special steel alloy had been warped and dented. There were a few more holes, as sharp objects pierced through the steel plate, allowing Zhou Wen and company to see tiny sharp hook-like talons.

Precisely six sounds! Zhou Wen kept count as he listened to the thumping and knew that six chicks had landed on their roof.

In the next second, before the sound could form an image in Zhou Wen’s mind, the car trembled violently. Outside the shattered car window, a gigantic golden bird claw appeared.

Then, Zhou Wen and company felt the car rapidly rise as it instantly rose into the sky.

How can I be so unlucky... Zhou Wen felt that he never had a smooth trip when he went out. This time, he was ridiculously unlucky.

Li Xuan could no longer hold his tongue, but Ah Sheng made a gesture a step ahead of him, indicating for him to remain silent and continue sitting

Soon, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan could already look down on the mountain. The entire car had been hoisted into the sky by the giant bird’s claw.

The chick exchanged looks with the humans for a few seconds before struggling a few times to pull its head out.

But soon, Zhou Wen heard the piercing sound of steel being torn through. The roof of the car was quickly ripped off by a tiny talon, forming a bigger hole. The chick jumped in

Seeing the chick about to land on him, Zhou Wen thought of the tiny, tender talon that could easily tear apart special steel plates. This gave him the urge to rush from the vehicle to flee.

Ah Sheng, who was in front, gestured for him to hold back. Clearly, he didn’t want Zhou Wen to make any sudden movements.

Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before the chick landed on his leg. Unlike what he imagined, the chick was very light and was at most half a pound in weight. It didn’t have any strength in its claws.

Before Zhou Wen could decide on how to deal with the chick, a few more chicks had jumped down from the hole and landed on Zhou Wen and Li Xuan, or into the back row of seats.

Another chick landed on Li Xuan’s head and stood perched there, as though it had no intention of moving.

Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were equally depressed, but they didn’t dare move. They had the urge to cry.

The six chicks jumped around Zhou Wen and company and pecked them from time to time. However, they didn’t really exert any strength, as though they were just curious.

It’s over, it’s over. If this giant bird were to bring us back, we would definitely become their meal. Li Xuan lamented inwardly about his bad luck.
