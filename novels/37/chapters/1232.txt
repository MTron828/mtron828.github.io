Chapter 1233: Collaboration

Zhou Wen had always wanted to have Star Stealer’s skill crystal drop, but he didn’t know if he was unlucky or if the skill wasn’t fated to be his.

Although Zhou Wen had never practiced Star Stealer before, he knew from past experiences that Star Stealer had a certain probability of stealing Companion Beasts. Furthermore, it was a random theft.

However, when he saw Liu Yun’s present state, Zhou Wen knew that something was amiss. This fellow’s Star Stealer had probably undergone a new transformation.

With a thought, Zhou Wen instantly retracted the Asura Saber. At the same time, a Legendary Companion Beast sword that had dropped from the Ancient Sword Tomb appeared in Zhou Wen’s hand as he continued slashing. The series of actions were completed in an instant.

Liu Yun’s fingers were fast and accurate. As he gripped the blade, Zhou Wen felt the sword in his hand disappear. Furthermore, the sword-type Companion Beast had severed its connection with Zhou Wen. Even the tattoo had vanished.

“Haha... You didn’t expect that, right...” Liu Yun laughed out loud as Zhou Wen’s sword was in his hand.

Liu Yun had been planning this for a long time. He had previously seen Zhou Wen easily slice open the Golden Battle God’s body with the Asura Saber. He knew that the Asura Saber was definitely the transformation of a Terror-grade Companion Beast. He had plotted meticulously, hoping to steal the Asura Saber while Looter King knew nothing about him.

Over the years, Liu Yun hadn’t been idle. Star Stealer was only a foundation, but now, he had cultivated it to an unprecedented level. He had broken through the level and ability restrictions of Star Stealer. He no longer counted on chance for stealing Companion Beasts. As long as his fingers touched a Companion Beast, he could steal it.

Of course, there were restrictions. Therefore, Liu Yun planned on stealing the Asura Saber while the other party didn’t know anything about him.

However, halfway through his laughter, Liu Yun realized that something was amiss. The weapon in his hand didn’t look like the Asura Saber, but a sword.

After carefully sensing it, Liu Yun immediately had the urge to vomit blood. How was this a Terror-grade Companion Beast? It was actually a Legendary sword.

Strange, what’s wrong with this fellow? Under such circumstances, why would he suddenly change his weapon? Could it be that he already knows about my Star Stealer’s prowess? Who is he? Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen in surprise as he felt that something was amiss.

The people watching the livestream didn’t have as many thoughts as Liu Yun, nor did they have such good eyesight.

They only saw Zhou Wen slash at Liu Yun before the saber in his hand vanished. However, Liu Yun had an additional weapon in his empty hand. They were alarmed.

“Thief Sage really lives up to his reputation. He actually snatched away Looter King’s weapon in battle.”

“That actually works? How did he do it? To be able to steal the other party’s Companion Beast, isn’t this ability too sick?”

“Thief Sage is too terrifying. With such an ability, wouldn’t he be able to steal from anyone? Who would dare use a Companion Beast in front of him?”

...

Liu Yun has indeed cultivated to the point where he can steal Companion Beasts as he wishes. He’s really impressive. Zhou Wen marveled inwardly, but he didn’t stop.

He secretly circulated his Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique and instantly exchanged a Companion Beast with the sword in Liu Yun’s hand.

Bam!

Liu Yun realized that the sword in his hand had suddenly become another sword. He immediately realized that something was amiss and threw the sword out.

The sword exploded in midair, sending Liu Yun flying with a tragic cry.

When people realized what was happening, they realized that Liu Yun, who had been blasted away, had vanished. When they looked at Looter King again, he was gone. Only the huge turtle was still fighting the Golden Battle God. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

On Venus, two figures constantly blinked in and out of existence. Soon, they left the Venusian instance dungeon and arrived at a rift valley.

“Junior Brother, how have you been?” Liu Yun had already guessed who Zhou Wen was. Although half of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique was the Godfiend Era’s power, half of it was the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art’s power.

“Give it back,” Zhou Wen said as he extended his hand.

Liu Yun said seriously, “Junior Brother, these dimensional crystals are limited in value. I have a big transaction that might interest you. If we succeed, the benefits we can obtain will be far more than just a few dimensional crystals.”

“What big transaction?” Zhou Wen knew that this fellow definitely had some plans. Otherwise, why would he expose the secret of entering and exiting the Venusian dimensional zone for no reason?

Liu Yun chuckled and said, “We definitely can’t defeat the Calamity-grade creature. No matter how many spoils you loot, you can only pick up the Golden Battle God Companion Eggs. You were already very lucky to have picked up two Golden Battle God Companion Eggs. The chances of you picking up Companion Eggs in the future will only drop.”

Zhou Wen naturally knew that the first dimensional creature to appear in a dimensional zone had a much higher chance of dropping a Companion Egg. The more he killed, the lower the drop rate.

“I’ve revealed the secret of entering and exiting the Venusian dimensional zone. The League of Guardians and the various factions will definitely not be able to hold back and attempt to conquer the Venusian dimensional zone. At the very least, they will want to kill the Golden Battle Gods first. When the time comes, we can mug them. The benefits we can obtain will be much better than having a Companion Egg drop,” said Liu Yun.

“What if they refuse to give in? We can’t just kill them all, right? I don’t want to be enemies with the entire world,” Zhou Wen said.

“It’s fine if they don’t offer them up. There’s still me,” Liu Yun said with a nasty smile.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he realized that Liu Yun was carrying out the theft openly.

“If the League of Guardians were to come, there would definitely be more than one or two. Would you be able to gain an advantage from them?” Zhou Wen sized up Liu Yun. He didn’t believe that Liu Yun had the ability to fight a crowd alone and rob the fellows from the League of Guardians.

Cave Era, Hermit, Great Skyfiend, and Blood Shaman were not people to be trifled with.

“That’s why I originally wanted to find an opportunity to make a single heist, but since you’re here, we can do a bigger one. How about it? Do you want to work together and do something big?” Liu Yun continued trying to rope Zhou Wen in.

“Sure, but I’ll determine who we are mugging.” Zhou Wen naturally didn’t care about benevolence or morality when it came to the League of Guardians.

“Alright, no problem. I’ll be under your command. How about 50-50 after the matter is done?” Liu Yun said.

“Sure. Return the dimensional crystals you just took.” Zhou Wen felt that this was something doable, so he discussed the details with Liu Yun.

The risk wasn’t high. After all, the two humans who were best at spatial dimension were here. Although there were other spatial experts, there weren’t many who were stronger than them. Even if the heist failed, it wouldn’t be a problem for the two of them to escape with their lives.

As the two of them were discussing, the huge turtle had already ricocheted the bullets of the six Golden Battle Gods, killing them. No bullets of any attribute could injure it at all.
