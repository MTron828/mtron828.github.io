“If an eleven- or twelve-year-old child has already condensed a Life Providence and it’s very special, will it be helpful in refining a Kuman Thong?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“I’m not too sure about that. After all, I specialize in nurturing Gu, and I only know the basics regarding Kuman Thong. You should ask a professional,” said Worm Dugu.

Zhou Wen chatted with them for a while before bidding them farewell. He wanted to figure out if Wang Chan’s Life Providence would affect Kuman Thong.

After knocking on the door of Gu Shanshui, Zhou Wen roughly recounted the matter, but he didn’t mention the Xiao family or Wang Chan.

“Apart from Heaven Babies, Earth Babies and Man Babies are actually unorthodox. Typically, fetuses that die early or were aborted are used to make Earth Babies and Man Babies. This way, the resentment will be greater and the spirituality will be stronger. Babies that are born will have weaker spirituality as they grow older. The older they are, the more unsuitable they are as Kuman Thong. Twelve years old is the theoretical limit, but very few people would really use such an old child to make Kuman Thong. Unless the child is very special and possesses a special Life Providence, it can be used to make some special evil Kuman Thong or Kuman Nee...”

After hearing Gu Shanhe’s explanation, Zhou Wen was even more certain that the reason the Xiao family wanted Wang Chan was likely related to the refinement of Kuman Thong.

If that’s the case, this Xiao family really deserves death. Zhou Wen was somewhat furious.

Zhou Wen planned on visiting the Xiao family after returning from the Dragon Corpse River to see if they really had such plans. If they really had such plans, Zhou Wen didn’t mind helping Wang Chan eliminate future troubles. It was also considered returning a favor to Wang Lu.

When Li Mobai returned, Zhou Wen told him that Li Xuan was also here. Li Mobai said indifferently that it had nothing to do with him before returning to his room.

The next morning, Zhou Wen, Gu Shanshui, Li Mobai, and company headed to Dragon Corpse River. As for Li Xuan and Worm Dugu, they had to make some preparations before catching the Ice Silkworm Gu King.

“People without the ability should just stay at home and await death. Why do you have to come out and court death?” Li Mobai said coldly as Zhou Wen and company parted ways with Li Xuan.

Li Xuan didn’t say a word as he left with Worm Dugu.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what to say. All he could do was pretend not to hear as he walked ahead with Gu Shanshui.

The Dragon Corpse River got its name because of a dragon dying in the river.

Before the dimensional storms, this was only a legend. No one had really seen a dragon corpse or dragon bones. However, after the dimensional storms, the Dragon Corpse River became a dimensional zone with many taboos.

For example, after entering the Dragon Corpse River, one absolutely could not touch the water of the Dragon Corpse River. Otherwise, one would become a zombie.

There was also the taboo of not being able to fly over Dragon Corpse River and not being able to drip blood in it. Also, women who were on their period could not enter the Dragon Corpse River.

Therefore, Zhou Wen and company could only enter the Dragon Corpse River by boat. The boat they were on was purchased by Gu Shanshui from a nearby family. According to Gu Shanshui, the materials on the boat had been specially processed. Gu didn’t like the smell of the wood on the boat and typically wouldn’t approach it.

“Li, the Dragon Corpse River is very dangerous. Are you sure you want to join us?” Before boarding the ship, Gu Shanshui asked Li Mobai again.

“With Zhou Wen around, it won’t be too dangerous. Just treat it as me broadening my horizons,” Li Mobai said with a smile.

Gu Shanshui didn’t say anything else and led everyone onto the boat. They left the riverbank and headed upstream of the Dragon Corpse River.

The Dragon Corpse River wasn’t very large, but the moment the ship left the riverbank, it felt extremely wide. Furthermore, there was a thick fog over the surface of the river. If it wasn’t for someone with experience like Gu Shanshui, it would have been very easy to lose one’s way in the fog.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to help Gu Shanshui row the boat, but Gu Shanshui told him that on the Dragon Corpse River, the eyes could be fooled. He needed to sense where the Corpse Bug was, so only he could row the boat himself.

After the boat entered the fog, Gu Shanshui took out a container made of clay. He filled the container with river water before placing the container at the bow. Finally, he took out a Gu that looked like a loach and placed it inside.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to game in such a place. He kept his mind focused as Truth Listener constantly scanned his surroundings to prevent any possible danger.

Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to sense that there were many dimensional creatures swimming in the nearby waters. However, they didn’t approach the wooden boat. It was unknown if it was thanks to the wooden boat or the Gu placed in the clay jar.

The wooden boat slowly rowed across the dark river. Zhou Wen and company abided by the Dragon Corpse River’s taboos, so there wasn’t any danger.

As the wooden boat slowly sailed, Zhou Wen suddenly felt cold sweat drip down his back. A terrifying palpitation made his heart pound.

With Truth Listener’s ability, Zhou Wen realized that at the bottom of the Dragon Corpse River, there seemed to be a huge shadow staring at them.

Plop... Plop... The Gu in the clay jar suddenly jumped as though it had been startled, making Gu Shanshui’s expression turn solemn.

Gu Shanshui grabbed the Gu from the clay container and placed it into the river. The Gu swam desperately into the distance, but before it could swim far, it suddenly vanished, leaving only ripples on the river surface.

When the Gu vanished, Gu Shanshui heaved a sigh of relief.

The wooden boat slowly rowed, but the shadow at the bottom of the river was too huge. After rowing for more than ten minutes, the wooden boat still remained above the shadow, unable to row away from it.

Zhou Wen’s mind was tense. He didn’t dare use Truth Listener to scan the shadow, afraid that he would alarm it. If the wooden boat were to capsize, Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of his safety, but the others on the boat would probably die.

Thankfully, the shadow didn’t move. Ever since it ate the Gu, it had only been watching them from the bottom of the river. After rowing for more than half an hour, the wooden boat finally rowed out of the shadow’s range.

Zhou Wen secretly heaved a sigh of relief when the feeling of being watched vanished. I wonder what’s at the bottom of the river? Could it really be a dragon? However, it feels different from the dragons I’ve seen in the past. Its aura is completely different.

Zhou Wen didn’t wish to cause trouble in such a place. It was naturally best if he didn’t need to fight.

After rowing for about four or five hours, a small island appeared on the river in front of them. The island was at most the size of a soccer field. On it was a small mountain that was less than a hundred meters tall. It was a typical volcano. In addition, large amounts of thick fog spewed out from the volcanic crater—probably the source of the thick fog over the river.

“There it is. The Corpse Bug is in the volcano. After we reach the mountain, I’ll lure the Corpse Bug out. Mr. Zhou, please follow the plan.” Gu Shanshui steered the wooden boat to the bank and got everyone to the shore.

Zhou Wen already knew of Gu Shanshui’s plan. All he needed to do was wait by the side. After the Corpse Bug was lured out by Gu Shanshui, he would take action.

Gu Shanshui got everyone to stay at the foot of the mountain. He only took Gu Lou and Gu He up the mountain. They practically crawled forward. When they arrived at the volcanic crater, they took out some small bottles that they had prepared. Every once in a while, they would pour a bottle of yellow liquid into the volcanic crater.

Zhou Wen had heard from Gu Shanshui that the liquid was called Corpse Oil. It was extracted from corpses. Only by using it could one lure the Corpse Bug out of the volcano.

This was something that required extreme patience. After seven to eight hours and pouring more than a hundred bottles of Corpse Oil, there was finally movement inside the volcano.
