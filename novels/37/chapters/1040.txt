Chapter 1041: 48 hours

With this in mind, Zhou Wen decided to send a Companion Beast to challenge him.

This Companion Beast had to be known by Zhong Ziya. If Ya accepted this Companion Beast’s challenge, he might very well be Zhong Ziya.

Of course, as a matter of precaution, Zhou Wen wouldn’t sacrifice his main combat strength.

Which Companion Beast should I send to challenge him? After some thought, Zhou Wen couldn’t think of a suitable Companion Beast.

If he sent a main combat pet like Tyrant Behemoth, not only would Zhong Ziya know, but everyone knew that it was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast.

Furthermore, if Ya wasn’t Zhong Ziya, who knew what strange skills it would produce. If Tyrant Behemoth was killed, it would be a huge loss.

If he wasn’t afraid of Night Thearch and the other fellows who had already reached the Terror grade, it wouldn’t be a bad idea for Zhou Wen to send Demonic Neonate to vie for first place. However, Zhou Wen didn’t know how many Terror-grade existences were hidden in the shadows. He didn’t dare take such a risk.

After some thought, Zhou Wen thought of a suitable Companion Beast.

Back when Zhong Ziya had used the Invisibility Cloak Companion Egg in exchange for Medusa’s dimensional crystal, not many people knew that the Invisibility Cloak was with Zhou Wen. Zhong Ziya was definitely one of them.

Furthermore, the Invisibility Cloak had its benefits. With three minutes of complete invisibility, it wasn’t easy to kill it. There was still time to surrender.

Another benefit was that ordinary people couldn’t see the Invisibility Cloak, nor would they know that his Companion Beast was challenging it. This made it much easier.

With this in mind, Zhou Wen summoned the Invisibility Cloak and made it float towards the cube.

As the Invisibility Cloak was invisible to begin with, no one could see him. Only some top experts could use some special methods to sense the existence of the Invisibility Cloak.

However, everyone’s attention was focused on the battle between Ya and the other Guardians. No one noticed the Invisibility Cloak’s arrival.

Ya was indeed very strong, but the continuous battles had drained him greatly. It was obvious that his strength and speed were decreasing.

Even so, the Guardian was still defeated by Ya. However, anyone could tell that Ya’s dominance was plummeting and wasn’t seemingly invincible as before.

The moment the Guardian admitted defeat, someone else issued a challenge.

Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen got the Invisibility Cloak to issue a challenge. The light from the Imperial Capital’s cube shot into the sky, shocking everyone.

“Who is it? Who issued the challenge here? Does our Imperial Capital have Guardians joining the battle?”

“Strange, why can’t I see anyone? Who’s issuing the challenge?”

“I don’t see a thing. Where is it?”

As everyone was bewildered, the words “Invisibility Cloak Challenges Ya” appeared on the cube’s screen. However, they still couldn’t see it. On the cube’s screen, the Invisibility Cloak remained invisible.

“Invisibility Cloak... Someone actually rehatched the Invisibility Cloak. However, this should be a Companion Beast, right?”

“A single Companion Beast actually dares to challenge a Guardian. Isn’t he a little too confident? Even if he has invisibility, it’s impossible for him to beat Ya, right?”

“Of course not. Although the Invisibility Cloak’s invisibility is powerful, its offensive power isn’t strong. I’m afraid it can’t even break through the Guardian’s armor.”

“It’s useless saying so much. Ya probably won’t accept Invisibility Cloak’s challenge. With so many Guardians challenging him, he should view such a Companion Beast with contempt.”

Everyone felt that it made sense, but then the cubes around the world lit up. Two names appeared at the same time—Ya and Invisibility Cloak.

“Holy sh*t, Ya actually accepted Invisibility Cloak’s challenge!”

“What’s Ya doing? Fighting a Companion Beast? From the looks of it, he’s really tired. He wants to use this opportunity to rest, right?”

Everyone felt that Ya had accepted the Invisibility Cloak’s challenge because he wanted to rest.

Zhou Wen was overjoyed when he saw that the Invisibility Cloak had been chosen.

From the looks of it, Ya is most likely Zhong Ziya. As Zhou Wen pondered, the Invisibility Cloak had already entered the void’s cube arena through the tunnel on the cube.

Ya remained standing in the cube’s arena, holding Primordial Immortal Sword in his hand. He didn’t show any emotions as though he didn’t recognize the Invisibility Cloak.

Is this fellow Zhong Ziya? Zhou Wen was somewhat unsure because in Ya’s eyes, there was only an infinite fighting spirit.

In the next second, Ya had already pulled out Primordial Immortal Sword and stabbed at the Invisibility Cloak.

The ordinary invisibility ability of Invisibility Cloak was clearly useless in front of Ya.

Ya’s strike was fast and ruthless. It was even more ferocious than the last battle.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to order Invisibility Cloak to use its complete invisibility ability. The Invisibility Cloak’s form vanished as Ya’s strike passed through it, failing to injure it.

When Primordial Immortal Sword passed through the Invisibility Cloak, Zhou Wen suddenly discovered a strange fluctuation in it. He couldn’t help but be alarmed.

Could it be that Ya has the ability to see through invisibility? As Zhou Wen was thinking, he suddenly saw Ya’s body dissipate like a stream of light after passing through the Invisibility Cloak. He then disappeared without a trace.

What skill is this? Is it also invisibility? Zhou Wen was momentarily taken aback.

When he saw the scene on the cube again, he was stunned.

On the cube screens around the world, Ya, who was ranked first, fell from first place for the first time. Replacing him was Zhou Wen’s Invisibility Cloak.

This time, it wasn’t just Zhou Wen. Everyone was stunned, unsure what was happening.

In Invisibility Cloak’s challenge of Ya, Ya had only struck once before admitting defeat.

Since they couldn’t see the Invisibility Cloak, they could only see Ya strike. They didn’t know how Ya lost or why he admitted defeat.

“That’s impossible, right? A Companion Beast can actually defeat a Guardian? And it’s a Guardian like Ya?”

“What the hell. A Companion Beast actually took first place!”

“Something must be going on. An absolute scam. I spent all my money betting on Ya to win and now I’ve lost everything. My savings are all gone. Boohoo.”

“Brother, gambling isn’t good. Don’t worry. Calm down and pay your debts. I’ll do the honors of taking care of your wife.”

The Guardians who were about to challenge Ya were stunned when they saw Ya lose and give up his first spot. They were momentarily stunned and didn’t know if they should continue.

Should they challenge the first place—Invisibility Cloak—or Ya, who had already fallen to second place?

However, Zhou Wen had already sensed that something was amiss with the Invisibility Cloak. There was a line of words written on the inside of the Invisibility Cloak.

“Help me occupy first place and I’ll rush back in 48 hours. You must not lose first place. Otherwise, I’ll lose my life... Zhong Ziya...”

Zhou Wen didn’t know how the line was written, but there was no doubt that Ya was Zhong Ziya. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

48 hours... You think too highly of me... Zhou Wen didn’t know what had happened, but it wasn’t an easy task to occupy first place on the rankings for 48 hours.

Now, the preparation time for all challenges had been shortened to an hour. In 48 hours, Zhou Wen had to accept the challenge forty-eight times. Furthermore, the same challenger couldn’t challenge another a second time within a day.
