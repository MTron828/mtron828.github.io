Chapter 403 Battling Ják

The two never expected such a turn of events. No matter how fast Zhou Wen retreated, his hand was quickly stained by the blood mist as Zheng Tianlun fell to the ground and screamed.

In a forest in the suburbs, Ják revealed a mocking smile. How could he place his hopes on others? He made Zheng Tianlun firmly believe that he needed Zhou Wen’s hair. Only then would Zheng Tianlun be able to fool Zhou Wen because even Zheng Tianlun himself believed that it was real. Others wouldn’t be able to see through the flaws.

“Old pal, it’s been a while since we got some exercise. It’s time to come out and get some exercise.” As Ják spoke, a sanguine aura on him surged and condensed into a blood-colored clown Life Soul.

The blood-colored clown Life Soul came in front of Ják. Ják pulled out the strand of Zheng Tianlun’s hair from the puppet and gave it to the clown Life Soul.

The clown Life Soul reached out to grab the hair, and it immediately burned with a blood-colored flame and quickly burnt to ashes. It transformed into a sanguine beam that fused into the clown’s body.

“By using your blood as the medium, I’ll use the soul as a guide, Blood Hex Clown, use your strength to make those ignorant people tremble in grief once again.” Ják looked excitedly at the Blood Hex Clown and growled.

A sanguine glint flashed in the eyes of the Blood Hex Clown as a demonic blood-colored flame rose over its body.

In his dorm, Zhou Wen looked at the blood on his hand and tried to shake it off, but it was already too late. He felt his ears heat up before a force entered his body from his palm and spread through his entire body. Large amounts of Primordial Energy surged into his body. It was massive, almost comparable to the lightning bolt he had endured at Dragon Gate Grotto.

Zhou Wen immediately realized that Truth Listener’s Evil Nullification Life Soul had taken effect, resolving the strange power of the assailant.

I was still too careless. Zhou Wen reflected over his faults, but after some thought, he realized that he was up against someone bent on getting him. No matter how prepared he was, it was inevitable for him to miss out certain things. The best way was to eliminate the enemy first to truly feel worry-free.

But now, he didn’t even know where his opponent was. When he looked at Zheng Tianlun who had his arms torn apart, Zhou Wen felt a chill run down his spine.

It was Zheng Tianlun this time, someone he didn’t care too much about. But what if the next person was Li Xuan, Wang Lu, or the rest? Could he still remain so indifferent?

Zhou Wen called the school’s emergency number and called for a doctor to handle Zheng Tianlun.

Ják stared at the Blood Hex Clown in front of him. Seeing the sanguine light in its eyes glow with greater intensity, he believed that the blood hex’s power was in control of Zhou Wen. He ordered, “Bring him here.”

Zhou Wen felt an endless stream of Primordial Energy surge into his body, preventing him from being able to accommodate it as large amounts of Primordial Energy seeped out of his body.

Suddenly, the Truth Listener earring seemed to be pulled by something as it floated up and pointed in one direction.

Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he walked outside. The moment he opened the door, he saw An Jing and Wang Lu standing outside, about to knock on the door. Zheng Tianlun’s screams had alerted them, which was why they had come over to take a look.

“Help me look after him. Don’t let him die. I have to make a trip.” Zhou Wen pointed at Zheng Tianlun who was screaming inside before walking out.

He didn’t pity Zheng Tianlun, but if Zheng Tianlun really died in his dormitory room, he would probably have a hard time explaining himself. Without any evidence, the college would only believe that he had killed Zheng Tianlun.

Regardless of An Jing’s and Wang Lu’s expressions, Zhou Wen headed straight for the direction the earring had pointed.

After leaving the school, Zhou Wen headed west according to the earring. Soon, he left the city and entered the suburbs.

A forest appeared in front of Zhou Wen, and the heat from the Truth Listener earring grew stronger. It made Zhou Wen realize that he was approaching his target.

After slowing down his speed, Zhou Wen carefully entered the forest. Truth Listener earring’s hearing was put to its greatest use. Everything within a hundred meters around him projected into an image in his mind thanks to his hearing.

Not long after entering the forest, the Truth Listener earring’s ability allowed him to see a man standing in the forest. In front of him floated a blood-colored clown-like Life Soul.

Just as Zheng Tianlun had said, the man was wearing a shirt and suit with a unique hat on his head. He had a standard Caucasian look with blue eyes and carved facial features. His hair was a rare silver color.

His skin was white to begin with, and with him looking a little pale, it looked like there was no blood in him. It was as if his face had been wiped with white powder.

When Zhou Wen sensed Ják, Ják also sensed something. He frowned and looked in Zhou Wen’s direction. At the same time, surprise flashed in his eyes.

“Did the bureau only send you here?” Zhou Wen gripped the Bamboo Blade tightly as he walked towards Ják. At the same time, he used Truth Listener’s ability to constantly sweep his surroundings to make sure that there were no ambushes. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“You are actually immune to the blood hex’s control. Furthermore, you were able to find me. Interesting.” Ják stared at Zhou Wen as he sized him up. His eyes were shimmering as though he was looking at some interesting toy.

“You won’t find it interesting very soon.” Zhou Wen had already confirmed that there weren’t any ambushes around him. He instantly unsheathed his Bamboo Blade and appeared in front of Ják instantaneously as though he had teleported. With Transcendent Flying Immortal, he slashed at Ják’s body with unparalleled speed.

Ják clearly hadn’t expected Zhou Wen to be that fast. Such strength was completely different from the information Shen Yuchi had given him. He was no ordinary student at the Legendary stage.

“To be at the Epic stage at such a young age?” Ják’s gaze froze slightly. Zhou Wen’s saber was simply too fast. Clearly, Ják was weaker when it came to combat. Perhaps due to his long imprisonment and him not having fully recovered, he couldn’t dodge in time.

The black gas in his hand struck at the Bamboo Blade, but the black gas was directly sliced apart by the Bamboo Blade. Ják’s palm was sliced off.

The Bamboo Blade did not stop and slashed right into Ják’s body.

With a ripping sound, Zhou Wen realized that the Bamboo Blade had only sliced through Ják’s jacket. He was gone. All that was left was the slightly trembling hand on the ground.

Zhou Wen scanned his surroundings and pushed the Truth Listener earring to its limits. It reflected everything around him in his mind, but he didn’t see any traces of Ják.

Just as Zhou Wen was searching for Ják, he suddenly felt that something was amiss. An ant had crawled over at his feet. There were many ants in the forest, but this ant was somewhat odd. It had actually crawled straight in front of Zhou Wen’s feet.

Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he rapidly retreated. The ant’s tiny body exploded like a bomb, blasting apart the ground and trees nearby, forming a huge crater that was more than two meters in diameter.
