Chapter 1288: Immortal

Translator: CKtalon

Ya’s name appeared in third place. It was a single Ya character, and behind Ya was a golden star. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Ah! Only one star?”

“What are you fantasizing about? It’s not bad to have one star. Ignoring having a star, which human on Earth can clear the Venusian dimensional zone and make it onto the rankings?”

“Ya is so impressive. He can even go on the rankings like this. Two Calamity-grade creatures have already perished.”

“The Holy Spirit Association is invincible!”

The entire Federation’s Internet seemed to explode with furor. Everyone was discussing Ya’s appearance on the rankings, but Zhou Wen was somewhat worried.

Others might not be able to tell, but Zhou Wen could tell that Ya’s Substitute skill hadn’t been able to completely block the fatal shot. He was injured.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t know how bad Ya’s injuries were. With the Cube putting his name on the rankings, it meant that he wasn’t dead.

However, even if he wasn’t dead now, it didn’t mean that his injuries weren’t eventually fatal. Perhaps he just hadn’t died immediately.

Zhou Wen was more worried that he wasn’t the only one who could tell that Ya was injured. If the League of Guardians could tell as well, Ya might not be able to return alive if they took the opportunity to pursue him.

Ya’s act of using Giant Armor God to block the shot had definitely infuriated the League of Guardians. It wasn’t impossible for the four Heavenly Kings and even the legendary Immortal to take action.

Although Liu Yun’s teleportation ability was amazing, it wasn’t easy to take someone to Venus.

Previously, when they went to Venus, Liu Yun could slowly send them there one by one. It wasn’t a problem for him to take a long time. No one knew that they were heading there ahead of time.

However, in this situation, the League of Guardians already knew that they were on Venus. It was impossible for them to immediately teleport back to Earth as a group. There was a high chance of being intercepted.

Now, Zhou Wen only hoped that the League of Guardians didn’t have a way to quickly reach Venus.

However, Zhou Wen felt uneasy. After some thought, he summoned Jade Rabbit and got it to stay in Overseer Manor. Then, he left a Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping mark on a brick by the garden.

After doing all of this, Zhou Wen teleported to Venus. He was wearing the Dragon King armor.

The members of the Holy Spirit Association had just been sent out of the Venusian dimensional zone and appeared on the platform of the hemispherical metal building. Before they could leave, they saw a figure floating in the air and staring at them.

Others had yet to discover the figure above, but Zhong Ziya seemed to sense something as he looked up.

Everyone felt somewhat puzzled as they looked in the direction of Zhong Ziya’s gaze. They immediately discovered the figure floating there and warily gathered their strength to prepare for battle.

The figure’s armor was almost pure light. It was like the purest light in the world, crystallizing into an armor that enveloped his body.

His body flowed with a deity’s halo. His entire body seemed to be blessed by the gods. He was surrounded by halos, making him look holy and godlike.

He stood in midair and looked at Zhong Ziya without a word.

“Who are you?” Ox Demon stared at the godlike figure and asked.

At that moment, the image of the rankings had ended. It returned to the scene outside the Venusian dimensional zone and people immediately saw the Holy Spirit Association’s group and the godlike figure.

Ox Demon’s question was what they wanted to know as well.

For such a figure to suddenly appear at this moment and block the Holy Spirit Association’s path, it was obvious that he had come for a reason.

However, the Holy Spirit Association had just entered the rankings and was in its prime. To dare provoke them at such a time, the person’s origins were probably not small.

The godlike figure didn’t answer Ox Demon. He continued looking at Zhong Ziya calmly.

The act of ignoring him immediately enraged Ox Demon. He gathered his strength and was about to leap up to strike the figure.

However, before he could move, Zhong Ziya pressed down on his shoulder.

“You are Immortal?” Zhong Ziya asked as he looked at the figure.

Everyone was alarmed when he said that. Almost everyone on Earth had heard of the League of Guardians’ Immortal, but only a few had actually seen him.

There were many rumors that Immortal was very likely a Calamity-grade Guardian.

“You have to pay the debt of Giant Armor God’s life.” The figure finally spoke. Although he didn’t directly admit it, it was equivalent to tacit agreement.

“How do I return it?” Zhong Ziya asked.

“Ten times,” Immortal said.

Zhong Ziya smiled and said, “That’s really something we can’t repay. We only have five people here.”

“Don’t count me in. I’m not from the Holy Spirit Association. It has nothing to do with me. I was coerced by them,” Liu Yun hurriedly corrected.

“I’ll take five first. The remaining can be owed.” Immortal ignored Liu Yun and still counted him, leaving Liu Yun depressed.

“Additional debt doesn’t matter once it reaches a certain threshold. Since it can be owed, why not keep it that way for the entire debt?” Zhong Ziya said.

“I’m afraid that’s not possible.” Immortal’s voice didn’t have any change in emotion. It was like a robot.

“Return now. I’ll have a good chat with this Immortal,” Zhong Ziya ordered Ox Demon and company.

Just as Ox Demon and company were about to accept the order, they heard Immortal say, “Your injuries are too serious. You no longer have the ability to fight. Your life is mine. Likewise for the rest. Leave your lives behind.”

“President!” Ox Demon and company were alarmed as they looked at Zhong Ziya in disbelief.

“Is this little trick enough to make you lose your sense of propriety?” Zhong Ziya held the Primordial Immortal Sword and pointed it at Immortal. At the same time, he said indifferently, “Do what’s required of you. Immortal of the League of Guardians, I’ve long wanted to see what tricks you have.”

As he spoke, the sword intent on the Primordial Immortal Sword surged. It was unimaginably terrifying.

“Old Ox, it’s just a Guardian. It’s not worth it for the president to personally take action. Just take him down.” Peacock Fairy, who had not said anything, suddenly spoke.

At the same time, she patted Ox Demon with one hand as a force immediately injected into his body.

Ox Demon was slightly taken aback. On the other side, True Martial also patted his other shoulder. Another strange force was injected into his body.

Although Ox Demon wasn’t as smart as Fairy Peacock, he immediately understood something when he saw her and True Martial’s actions. Without looking at Zhong Ziya, he gathered his strength and tore through the air to attack Immortal.

Ox Demon knew very well that Fairy Peacock and True Martial’s loyalty to Zhong Ziya was no less than his. It was absolutely impossible for them to disobey Zhong Ziya’s orders, unless it was as Immortal had said—Zhong Ziya had been severely injured.

With the augmentation of Fairy Peacock and True Martial, Ox Demon’s strength and speed were pushed to unimaginable heights.. The power he emitted was like a destructive meteor that struck at Immortal.
