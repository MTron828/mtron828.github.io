Chapter 1739 Lake of Fog

“It’s indeed in the dimension,” Li Xuan said gloomily as he looked at the golden god-like creature.

Zhou Wen, Ming Xiu, and company didn’t say a word as they watched the creature walk towards the lake.

His body emitted a golden sun-like glow. The fog over the lake quickly dispersed as the surroundings instantly became clear.

However, there was still nothing on the lake. All that could be seen was water ripples.

The creature from the Sun race walked on the surface of the lake. His tall body looked like he was walking on flat ground over the water surface. He had the aura of a true god descending to the mortal world.

After walking a short distance, the water suddenly churned. The lake water seemed to come to life as it transformed into a pair of arms that wrapped around the Sun race member. They grabbed his legs and were about to pull him into the lake.

The Sun race member’s body emitted a golden glow as the pair of water arms seemed to vaporize due to the high temperature, instantly turning into steam. A strange scream sounded underwater before there was silence.

Moments later, the lake seemed to boil. The waves churned as pairs of arms extended out of the lake. The entire lake seemed to turn into a forest of arms.

Countless water arms grabbed at the Sun race member as the distant water arms crawled out of the water. One could see that they were water demons condensed from water. They looked a little like humans, but their ears were like fins. Where their legs should have been, there was a snake’s tail.

The countless water demons leaped out of the water and pounced at the Sun race member, but he didn’t panic at all. The Sun God Light on his body glowed brightly as all the water demons that were illuminated immediately vaporized. No water demon could approach him.

The Sun race member walked deeper into the Lake of Fog step by step.

There were countless water demons in the lake, but none of them could approach him. Along the way, countless water demons were vaporized by the Sun God Light.

In just more than ten minutes, the fog ahead opened up and a swath of green appeared.

A small green island appeared over the lake. The island was flat and there were almost no undulations. The ground was covered in green grass, but in the middle of the island, there was a tree. The tree looked like a crown, and its trunk looked ordinary. However, the leaves looked like they were forged from silver. There were many golden apple-shaped fruits on the tree.

The Sun race member walked to the tree and reached out to pluck a golden apple. Then, he walked to a spot similar to a teleportation nexus. As the teleportation nexus’s light rose, the Sun race member vanished.

The Cube’s screen changed as a Cube ranking appeared. On it was the name “Sun race’s Raleigh.”

“That’s it? It looks simple. The fruits on the tree are limited. I don’t know if there will be any left after plucking them. Why don’t we take the opportunity to pluck one now?” Li Xuan said.

“It looks simple, but there’s something profound about it. Don’t act rashly.” Ming Xiu hurriedly stopped Li Xuan.

Just as Li Xuan was about to say something, he saw the Cube’s screen light up again. Another person was challenging the Cube.

“It’s the representative of the Family Clan of Gods, Reddy.” Li Xuan immediately recognized a human with flames burning all over his body.

Reddy clearly had the same thoughts as Li Xuan. He wanted to take the initiative and pluck the golden apple now.

The Sun race’s Raleigh had relied on his power of the sun to safely cross the Lake of Fog. His power of fire and the power of the sun were both scorching. He believed that it wouldn’t be difficult to deal with the water demons.

However, when Reddy landed on the lake, his body sank into it.

A look of horror appeared on Reddy’s face as though he was struggling to fly up, but it was to no avail. His flaming body quickly sank into the lake. All one could see was a red glow gradually dimming under the lake. Moments later, there was no sign of him. The Cube’s screen switched back to the rankings. On it was still ‘Sun race’s Raleigh.’

Li Xuan’s expression turned nasty as he said with lingering fear, “That was close. That Reddy was at the Calamity grade after all. He also had the power of fire that restrains the water element, but he was actually finished just like that. Thankfully, I didn’t go.”

It wasn’t just Li Xuan who felt a lingering fear. Upon seeing this scene, many people on Earth were alarmed. Reddy was considered a famous figure now. He had also entered the top ten in the previous battle of the Big Dipper. Nobody expected him to die so easily.

Instantly, the Lake of Fog and Raleigh became a hot topic of discussion. Due to Raleigh’s appearance, the average person knew that the place might be a dimension. People clearly became more intrigued about the dimension.

Of course, they were also guessing Raleigh’s level. The Calamity-grade Reddy had died without a stir, but Raleigh could easily pass through the Lake of Fog. The difference was extraordinary. Some people even guessed that he was at the Apocalypse grade. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, a human powerhouse like Zhou Wen knew that it was impossible for Raleigh to be at the Apocalypse grade, but he was very likely a Heaven-level existence.

Although Zhou Wen was also paying attention to the Lake of Fog, he had no intention of challenging it. The most important thing now was to quickly advance the remaining two Essence Energy Arts to the Calamity grade.

Tai Sui and Primordial Spore were doing well in Kunlun Mountain’s canyon. The spores had given them immense help. Tai Sui had already reached the Calamity grade and was still growing. It was only a matter of time before Primordial Spore advanced to the Calamity grade. In the future, they would be two very important combat forces.

However, he hadn’t found a suitable dimensional zone that matched the Godfiend Era. This left him depressed.

“Old Zhou, look who’s here.” One day, Zhou Wen was studying the information on dimensional zones when he heard Li Xuan’s voice coming from afar.

“Wang Lu!” Zhou Wen went out and saw Li Xuan and Wang Lu walk over.

“Zhou Wen, why do you look the same? Even a woman like me is jealous,” Wang Lu said with a smile as she sized up Zhou Wen.

“You haven’t changed much either,” Zhou Wen said.

Li Xuan whistled. “Old Zhou, what’s with that look in your eyes? Wang Lu has clearly grown a lot.”

Not only did Li Xuan accentuate the word ‘grown’, but he also dragged it out. As he spoke, he even scanned Wang Lu from top to bottom.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but look in the direction of his gaze. Wang Lu’s face immediately flushed red as she slapped Li Xuan in the face, jerking his face to the other side as his mouth contorted.

“That’s unfair. Old Zhou ogled as well. Why did you only hit me?” Li Xuan rubbed his face and said indignantly.

“Blame it on your mouth!” Wang Lu spat and turned to Zhou Wen. “I heard you are looking for a spatial dimensional zone?”
