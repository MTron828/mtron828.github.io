Chapter 1353: I’m Not Sweetie

Translator: CKtalon

“I died so tragically… I died so tragically…” The blonde girl’s hair was disheveled as she floated towards Zhou Wen and let out a terrifying cry. She looked like a haunting ghost.

Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he couldn’t help but take two steps back. He wanted to escape, but he couldn’t think of where to run. Since the other party could keep up with his interstellar teleportation ability, it didn’t seem like there was anywhere he could run.

When a person was forced into a corner, they would not know how to be afraid. Or rather, they would be numb with fear.

Zhou Wen was just about to go all out when the blonde girl floated over like a ghost. Perhaps it was because she was too excited, or perhaps it was because she had failed to notice her surroundings after successfully frightening Zhou Wen—

As she flew in the air, she didn’t notice that her blonde hair had been caught by a sharp rock protruding from the side. When she charged forward, her hair was yanked back and she immediately fell to the ground in front of Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen looked at the blonde girl who had fallen to the ground. When their eyes met, the air seemed to freeze.

Swoosh!

The blonde girl seemed to instant transmit back into the air as though nothing had happened. She continued floating towards Zhou Wen and once again shouted, “I died so tragically… I died so tragically…”

However, for some reason, Zhou Wen no longer had any fear. He looked at the blonde girl and felt like laughing.

The blonde girl was clearly still terrifying and Zhou Wen was definitely no match for her, but he couldn’t feel the same fear as before.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen could tell that the blonde girl seemed to have some concerns. She only circled around him to scare him and didn’t really attack.

Otherwise, with the strength the blonde girl had just displayed, she could have attacked him from behind without him noticing. There was no need for her to go through all this trouble.

Zhou Wen stood motionless and all the blonde girl did was appear and disappear around him as she let out terrifying cries. Apart from that, she didn’t do anything else.

“Then what should I do to let you die in peace?” Zhou Wen felt that he should give her a way out. After all, she was a big shot.

If she really didn’t have an out, she might really kill him out of embarrassment.

When the blonde girl heard Zhou Wen, she immediately stopped and pointed at the candy box in his pocket. Without any hesitation, she said, “Tell me, where did you get your candy box from?”

The blonde girl was just too inexperienced. She immediately revealed her goal.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he sized up the blonde girl. He seemed to realize something and blurted out, “You are Sweetie, right?”

“How do you know… I’m not the beautiful and cute Sweetie… You’ve got the wrong person…” The blonde girl waved her hand in a hurry to draw a line.

“That’s a pity. I picked up this candy box in Sweetie’s Hut and thought that it should be Sweetie’s. I kept thinking of returning it to the beautiful and cute Sweetie, but I couldn’t find her…” Zhou Wen took out the candy box and held it in his hand.

“Which hut did you find it in?” Sweetie hurriedly asked.

“On a doll in the Chaos Hut.” Zhou Wen had already guessed that the blonde girl was most likely Sweetie.

Thinking back to what the woman in the wooden hut had said, Zhou Wen roughly knew that the blonde girl was probably the terrifying existence the woman had mentioned.

“You’re lying. How could my doll steal the candy box?” Sweetie said in disbelief.

That terrifying doll is just her toy doll? What’s the origin of this Sweetie? A dimensional zone like the Time Hut is actually named after her…?As Zhou Wen thought, he said, “Why would I lie? You won’t be able to verify it even if I randomly said that I picked it up from a table. Besides, if I didn’t find it on a doll, how would I know that there was a doll?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Sweetie was stunned by the question. She thought carefully and realized that it was true.

“Give me the candy box,” said Sweetie.

“I can’t give you the candy box,” Zhou Wen said as he retracted the candy box and shook his head.

“Why can’t you give it to me? It’s not yours,” said Sweetie.

“It’s not mine, but it’s not yours either. This is the beautiful, kind, and cute Sweetie’s candy box. I was in danger back in the Chaos Hut. I nearly fell into a hopeless situation. When I was about to give up, it was this candy box that gave me hope. It allowed me to have the courage to continue forging forward. Only then did I come out alive… I have to personally return it to the gentle and kind Sweetie… Even if you want to kill me, I won’t give it to you.” Zhou Wen had been with Li Xuan and the antelope for a long time, so he had clearly been led astray by them.

Sweetie’s face flushed red. Her oppressive aura seemed to dissipate instantly.

“Did you eat the lemon candy inside?” Sweetie pretended to be fine as she asked Zhou Wen.

“What lemon candy? I just got an empty box.” Zhou Wen shook his head.

That’s strange. Although the lemon candy has the ability to break one’s order in life, it should be useless for the doll…?Sweetie frowned in thought.

She originally imagined that the candy box had been lost in the Past Hut, resulting in her inability to find it. It turned out to be in the Chaos Hut, and it was in the hands of her doll.

It meant that things weren’t as simple as just losing it.

There was no reason why she couldn’t find it in the Chaos Hut. There was only one possibility for not finding the candy box back then—someone had hidden it.

Back then, the only people in the Time Hut were her, Little Chrysanthemum, Yana, Spacetime Piglet, and the doll. Spacetime Piglet and the doll were Sweetie’s toys. The lemon candy was useless to them.

Little Chrysanthemum was a loyal servant. It was impossible for her to steal the candy box and lemon candy. Even if she wanted them, she only needed to ask. There was no need to steal them.

“It can’t be Yana!” Although Sweetie thought of the most likely conclusion, she was unwilling to believe it.

“Is Yana a rather beautiful woman who can grow six wings…” Zhou Wen described Yana.

“Did you kill Yana?” Sweetie bit her lip and asked Zhou Wen.

“If the Yana you mentioned is that woman, I killed her,” Zhou Wen admitted readily.

“Why did you kill her?” Sweetie asked with a complicated expression.

“Because she’s evil. If I didn’t kill her, she would’ve killed me,” Zhou Wen said solemnly.

“Why would she kill you?” Sweetie didn’t believe that Yana was such a person.

“How would I know? She was completely unreasonable. She wanted me dead the moment we met. However, now that I think about it, it might have been because she knew that the candy box was with me and wanted to snatch it away..” Zhou Wen connected the dots, but he deliberately skipped on some of the details.
