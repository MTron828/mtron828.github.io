Chapter 640 Death Knell

At this moment, Zhou Wen felt that the techniques he had been practicing recently were mainly movement techniques. Now that he couldn’t move, he lacked the means to defeat his enemy.

I’ve had too little time. I don’t have the time to learn so many skills. Zhou Wen’s time was indeed limited. Others only needed to advance one Life Soul, but he needed to advance four.

Furthermore, his training time would be about a year. To be able to train his movement technique to epitome standards, his progression speed was terrifying.

However, at the critical moment, disasters didn’t give Zhou Wen the time to cultivate. Just as the white flames were about to shoot at him, Zhou Wen didn’t slash out again with Bamboo Blade. Instead, he used Demonic Astral Wheel’s suction and struck out with his palm. Using the spinning power, he diverted the white flames to the side.

Despite that, the rotation of the Demonic Astral Wheel gradually slowed down in the white flames. A few seconds later, the spinning force wasn’t enough to divert the white flames. All Zhou Wen could do was deliver another Demonic Astral Wheel.

Zhou Wen sheathed the Bamboo Blade and constantly struck out Demonic Astral Wheel with both hands, diverting the white flames that spewed at him to the side.

Therefore, a magical scene happened. The monster spewed out flames that resembled white fire snakes, but they were diverted to the side by Zhou Wen’s Demonic Astral Wheel. It bloomed like flaming chrysanthemums that filled the sky.

“Junior Brother, duck!” At this moment, Liu Yun suddenly shouted.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen crouched down and lowered his head. He saw a needle-like cold beam fly over his head.

The monster’s attention was on Zhou Wen, so it shifted its gaze downwards as he ducked. It wasn’t prepared for the cold beam of light as it instantly nailed into its eyes. The monster immediately let out a tragic cry.

Zhou Wen took the opportunity to draw his saber and slash out. The Demonic Astral Wheel spun and beheaded the screaming monster.

On careful look, Orchid Blade had penetrated the monster’s eyes.

“Thanks.” Zhou Wen extended his hand and sucked the Orchid Blade back before throwing it at Liu Yun again.

“I won’t be able to live for long if you’re dead. Two people are better than one. I’m doing this for myself. Instead, I’m more concerned about you. You expended so much Essence Energy just now. It’s best you recover your Essence Energy before continuing,” said Liu Yun.

Although Zhou Wen didn’t really need Liu Yun’s help, he would provide him significant help in escaping Netherworld City since Liu Yun had expressed his goodwill and was willing to work together with him to face the problem.

“If you don’t have Essence Energy Crystals, I can sell them to you. How about ten Epic Essence Energy Crystals for your movement technique?” Liu Yun had some ideas about Zhou Wen’s movement techniques.

His movement technique was already fast enough. Few people at his level could catch up to him, but Zhou Wen’s movement technique was even faster than his. He also wanted to know how Zhou Wen had mastered it.

“Don’t you think ten crystals is a tad too little?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“You have to know that we are in a dire situation. No one knows when we will be able to leave, nor do we know how many battles we will have to go through. The present value of Essence Energy Crystal is ten times or even a hundred times what it usually is. It’s very possible that an Essence Energy Crystal might save us at the end. If you can use another skill, you might be able to survive. Do you still think it’s expensive?” Liu Yun said seriously.

“It’s still expensive. Even if an Essence Energy Crystal is worth a hundred times more, do you think it can be exchanged for a divine movement technique?” Zhou Wen asked.

“What? Your movement technique is at the divine level?” Liu Yun was shocked.

“As real as it gets. If you really want to know how it’s done, it’s best you show some sincerity and help me obtain Star Stealer,” Zhou Wen said.

“Does the method need Mythical Skill Crystals?” Liu Yun asked.

“There’s no need. All the skills are at the Epic and Legendary stage. There’s no need for Mythical skill crystals,” Zhou Wen answered.

“You comprehended a divine skill yourself?” Liu Yun was even more surprised.

Zhou Wen’s Mythical Companion Beasts could be explained away by him being rich. There might be a faction or massive resources backing him.

However, comprehending a divine skill wasn’t something that could be accomplished with just resources. Although resources were one of the most important conditions, what really mattered was one’s perceptivity.

“Teacher’s eyes are really sharp. A random student he takes in has such standards. Unfortunately, in such a place, your divine movement technique is useless,” said Liu Yun with a sigh.

“Let’s continue walking. We don’t know how long a Netherworld City day is. Perhaps we don’t have as much time as we imagined,” Zhou Wen said as he continued walking forward.

Liu Yun quickly chased after him, clearly wanting to cooperate with Zhou Wen.

After taking a few steps, Liu Yun also encountered dimensional creatures. This time, the dimensional creatures they encountered were the Blade Executioners they had previously seen. The cause of death was naturally death by blades.

Liu Yun had seen Zhou Wen kill the Blade Executioner, so he already had some understanding of it. He didn’t spend much effort to kill the Blade Executioner.

The two of them walked forward together. There were four types of dimensional creatures they often encountered: Blade Executioners who delivered death by blade, Flaming Evil Spirits who used Fire Burning, Flash Spirit Flying Blade who inculcated Horror, and Water Demon who used Drown.

They were all Epic dimensional creatures with their own characteristics. However, with Zhou Wen and Liu Yun’s cooperation, they killed them one by one, allowing them to smoothly walk over the stone slabs.

With every step the two of them took, Liu Yun would shout at the person ahead, hoping to see if he could hear him.

Zhou Wen naturally knew that it was useless. Unless they came within ten stone slabs of each other, the other party definitely couldn’t hear their voices.

Zhou Wen did some calculations. They needed 153 steps to reach a distance of ten stone slabs from the person. That would leave them with slightly over 200 steps. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

This was only enough for them to speak to each other. It was unknown how many steps it would take to leave Netherworld City.

The two of them took 120 steps and could already see that the person closest to them was very close. Just as they were about to continue advancing, they suddenly heard a bell chime.

Clang!

The sudden ringing of the bell gave the two of them a fright. The sound was coming from a building at the end of the stone steps. There was a brass bell hanging on it that emitted the heart-shuddering sound.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The bell constantly rang. Zhou Wen had never heard such a strange bell chime. He felt that it wasn’t auspicious.

“What crappy bell is this? Why does it sound like a death knell?” Liu Yun blurted out.

“Death knell?” Zhou Wen was immediately taken aback.

After Liu Yun said it, he thought about it carefully and was stunned. The two of them exchanged looks and saw the unease in each other’s eyes.

The bell rang seven times before it finally stopped. In front of the building, a throne made of yellow jade slowly rose. There was a person sitting on the throne.
