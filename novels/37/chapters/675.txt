Chapter 676: Monk-Robed Skeleton

The white elephant didn’t seem to notice the black claw as it continued walking forward. However, when the black claw touched its body, white smoke emitted.

As if charcoal had encountered water, the black claw retreated back into the river.

The huge white elephant continued walking towards Dragon Gate Grotto as though nothing had happened. It was as though it only had one goal in its eyes.

The black claw never appeared again even when the white elephant stepped onto the river bank.

When it tore out of the water and got ashore, the water droplets on his body automatically slid off, leaving nothing behind.

Zhou Wen and company watched helplessly as the white elephant walked towards Dragon Gate Grotto and headed for the mountain temple.

Li Xuan looked at where An Tianzuo and company were. Seeing that they were only standing high above and watching without giving any orders, he turned back to look at the white elephant.

The white elephant walked on the mountain rocks. Wherever the giant foot passed, the rocks cracked, leaving behind huge footprints.

The dimensional creatures in Dragon Gate Grotto didn’t dare approach the white elephant. All of them hid in the cave and trembled, not daring to walk out of the cave.

The huge white elephant walked all the way to the temple before stopping to look at the monk-robed skeleton that emitted a resplendent golden light. It raised its trunk and let out an elephant’s trumpet.

“Not good! Quickly cover your ears!” Zhou Wen shouted at Li Xuan.

However, it was already a little too late. Everyone felt a thunderclap in their ears, causing their minds to buzz. The soldiers with weaker cultivation levels fell to the ground. Even Epic officers saw stars.

“Help... Help me up... Why do I feel like I’m in front of gold ingots...” Li Xuan seemed drunk as his body swayed violently.

Zhou Wen was fine as he hurriedly held him up.

After a while, Li Xuan, the Epic officers, and tutors came to their senses. As for the soldiers, they were still lying on the ground, unable to stand up as though they were drunk.

When Zhou Wen looked at the temple, he saw that the white elephant had already stepped into it.

The moment it stepped into the temple, the golden light on the monk-clothed skeleton suddenly flared up brightly like the sun. The golden light shone on the white elephant’s body, causing it to falter.

The white elephant paused for a moment, but it quickly walked towards the monk-robed skeleton again. Under the suppression of the terrifying golden light, it found it extremely difficult to take a step forward.

However, it had no intention of giving up. It continued walking towards the monk-robed skeleton. The closer it was to the skeleton, the slower its speed became.

When it was only a few steps away from the skeleton, it took each step like it was carrying a mountain.

Finally, the white elephant walked in front of the monk-robed skeleton. Just as Zhou Wen was guessing what it was about to do, it raised its trunk and swept it at the monk-robed skeleton as though it was a huge pillar that emitted terrifying holy light.

“It wants to destroy the monk’s remains?” Li Xuan said in surprise.

Just as he said that, the white elephant’s trunk slammed into the monk-robed skeleton. However, the monk-robed skeleton wasn’t smashed to bits. It continued sitting there cross-legged.

It suddenly raised its bony hand and grabbed the white elephant’s trunk.

In the next moment, everyone saw an unbelievable scene. With a wave of the skeleton’s hand, the gigantic elephant’s body was easily thrown away.

Under Zhou Wen and company’s horrified gazes, the massive elephant fell into the river beneath Dragon Gate Grotto.

Boom!

Water splashed up hundreds of feet high as the huge elephant’s body smashed into the river, creating a huge crater at the bottom. Instantly, the water level around the river bank increased drastically, almost reaching the encampment.

“That monk-robed skeleton is alive? Did he throw the terrifying elephant flying with one hand? What kind of crazy strength is that?” Li Xuan exclaimed.

Zhou Wen was alarmed and uncertain. It could fling such a massive and powerful white elephant easily. Such immense strength was probably something only Tyrant Behemoth could achieve when it used Absolute Strength.

However, no matter how Zhou Wen looked at it, the monk-robed skeleton didn’t look like it had powers like Absolute Strength.

What’s his background? Why is the white elephant attacking him? Zhou Wen sized up the monk-robed skeleton in surprise.

The skeleton was crystalline and it emitted an intense golden glow, like a Buddha’s golden body.

Although the monk robe was tattered, it couldn’t conceal the Buddhist light.

He sat in a lotus position with a stone door behind him. There were no words or patterns on the door, and behind it was an extremely simple squarish stone house. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The stone house was less than two meters tall, and the stone door was even shorter. The monk-robed skeleton was sitting in front of the door which was only twenty to thirty centimeters taller than him. A normal adult would probably have to bend to enter.

Could it be that there’s something strange in the stone house behind the monk-robed skeleton? Zhou Wen was guessing when he heard a tumultuous sound.

Turning his head, he saw the white elephant fighting a similarly gigantic black creature in the river. As the river water churned, Zhou Wen finally saw what the black object was.

“What a huge turtle! Such a huge turtle must have lived for hundreds of thousands of years. Killing it to make a stew will definitely be nutritious,” Li Xuan exclaimed with widened eyes.

The black creature was actually a huge turtle. It was pitch-black and its shell was like black iron. Its body wasn’t much smaller than the white elephant.

It fought the white elephant in the river and bit its neck, refusing to let go. The white elephant couldn’t shake it off no matter how hard it tried. Its holy flesh and blood couldn’t defend it from the turtle’s teeth. Blood gushed out from the bite, dyeing the river red.

Terrifying power constantly erupted from the elephant’s body, but it couldn’t do anything to the huge turtle. The turtle’s shell was just too hard. Even with the elephant’s strength, it couldn’t smash it open.

The holy light on the white elephant’s body grew dimmer. Just as the huge turtle was about to kill it in the river, a bird’s cry suddenly resounded.

A golden light descended from the sky. It was the giant golden bird.

It tore through the air like a bolt of lightning as its pair of talons grabbed at the tortoise’s turtle shell. It managed to penetrate the black iron-like turtle shell. The pain made the turtle release its grip.

However, the golden bird didn’t stop. It flapped its wings and lifted the huge turtle high into the sky. It brandished its sharp claws and tore it to pieces in the blink of an eye. Blood splattered across the sky.

The people in the encampment were dumbfounded. The golden bird was so ferocious that it left them terrified.

This giant bird’s strength is probably comparable to Tyrant Behemoth! Zhou Wen was also alarmed. Only now did he realize how impressive Leng Zongzheng’s feat of getting the giant golden bird to retreat was.
