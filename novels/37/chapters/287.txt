Chapter 288 Strange Vehicle Adventure

Zhou Wen watched as large numbers of white bats landed in the tunnel in fragments behind him. There were also some crystals, and he couldn’t help but feel wistful.

The strange vehicle continued to move forward. He didn’t know what the consequences would be if he left it, so he didn’t attempt to pick up the crystals. He could only watch as the strange vehicle left the spoils untouched.

Despite him killing a large group of bats, there were still large numbers that didn’t fear death as they charged forward. Looking at the white shadows flying above them, it made one’s scalp tingle.

Zhou Wen had just used the Grand Yin Wind and his Yuan Qi hadn’t recovered when he saw large swaths of white bats rush down. His expression changed slightly as he clenched his Bamboo Blade and prepared to engage the white bats in melee combat.

Lu Yunxian and Lu Ning summoned their Companion Beasts to prepare for battle. The carriage was too small, so they could only summon Companion Beasts in their companion form-as armor or weapons-to aid them in battle.

When a large horde of white bats charged down, Zhou Wen was just about to draw his saber when there was a humming sound. All the white bats above retreated. None of them continued charging as they circled the ceiling of the cave.

Zhou Wen and company were stunned as they looked ahead. They didn’t know when the puppet began holding a strange musical instrument. It was likely made of stone; flat with a few holes on it. It was rather crudely made.

However, just as the white bat was about to charge down, the puppet placed the stone musical instrument in front of its face. Its face was a wooden board without any facial features. It was unknown how it blew, but it produced a humming sound.

The moment the sound emitted, the white bats immediately retreated again. They hovered above them, but none had the courage to swoop down again.

The strange vehicle moved through the bats, but they didn’t encounter any more attacks from them. They safely moved forward.

“Young Master Wen... Don’t tell me that the puppet is alive...?” Lu Yunxian looked at the puppet with his mouth agape. He thought it was a mechanical object. Who knew that there would be such a development?

Zhou Wen looked at the puppet as well. The puppet stood in front, no longer moving its arm. However, the strange vehicle continued to move forward at a constant speed. The crank was also spinning autonomously.

The puppet stood there, holding the stone musical instrument as it looked forward into the distance. However, without any facial features and eyes, what was it using? It was extremely bizarre.

Zhou Wen found it odd, but since it was beneficial to them, he didn’t have any intention of attacking the puppet. He was just worried about where the strange carriage would take them.

The scenery in front of them suddenly broadened as the white bats that filled the sky scattered. Zhou Wen and company looked past the scattered white bats and saw a blue sky.

Unlike the cave from before, this place was actually a huge and boundless space. It was impossible to see the end of this space at a glance. In the distance, one could even see the sea and islands. Above them was a blue sky.

However, the blue sky was a little too blue. It was like a sapphire. Zhou Wen looked carefully and realized that it really was a sapphire.

A gigantic sapphire formed the sky of the underground space by occupying the entire area above.

There were no suns or stars. The sapphire emitted a faint blue light that illuminated the entire underground space. At the same time, everything in the underground space had a blue hue.

In the next second, the strange vehicle landed on the blue ocean. Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was an ocean, but he just couldn’t see the water body’s end. All he saw was deep blue seawater.

The strange vehicle cruised over the sea surface. Its stone wheels were rolling across the surface as though it was traveling on flat ground. They dragged out two white waves on the surface of the sea in its wake.

“What’s that underneath?” Lu Yunxian pointed at the seawater beside him in horror.

Zhou Wen and Lu Ning looked at the surface of the sea and saw a huge shadow, as though a behemoth was swimming under the strange vehicle.

All they could see was a gigantic shadow, nothing else. Furthermore, the shadow was gradually expanding.

Splash!

The seawater erupted like a volcanic eruption as it sprayed hundreds of feet into the sky. Huge waves formed as the seawater struck the strange vehicle. However, the strange vehicle appeared imperturbable. This didn’t stop the seawater from pouring into the carriage, drenching them.

However, Zhou Wen and company weren’t in the mood to care about the seawater. The three of them widened their eyes as they stared at the sea by the side of the war wagon.

A huge creature that looked like it was carved from obsidian extended half its body from the sea. Its body was perfect and gorgeous. Its black obsidian-like scales shimmered and every inch of its body seemed to be exquisitely carved. Even if one were to observe the titanic body with a magnifying glass, one wouldn’t be able to find any crudeness or flaws.

The huge body that was like a hill exuded an exquisite and majestic feeling.

“Dragon... That’s a dragon... a dragon carved from obsidian...” Lu Yunxian stammered as he pointed at the creature that had stretched half its body out of the sea.

Zhou Wen didn’t look too good either. The development seemed to exceed his expectations. Regardless of whether the terrifying creature in the sea was a dragon or not, he could tell from its aura that it was a terrifying existence. It might even be stronger than the white dragon in Dragon’s Well.

Boom! Boom!

A series of crashing waves sounded as the seawater around the strange vehicle churned. Copious amounts of seawater surged over, knocking Zhou Wen and company off their feet.

However, their gazes were never on the strange vehicle’s interior, but outside. Black dragon heads emerged one after another. One... Two... Three...

When Zhou Wen saw the ninth black dragon extend its head out of the sea, he felt numb.

“Roar!” The nine creatures carved from obsidian roared at the strange vehicle, sending sonar waves at them. Even the seawater turned into tumultuous waves as a result of the sonar waves. They surged at the puny strange vehicle from every direction. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“We’re doomed!” Lu Yunxian’s expression changed drastically. Such terrifying creatures and such terrifying sound waves implied that they had no way of escaping the calamity.

Zhou Wen held the banana fan tightly as he prepared for death. Even though he knew he wasn’t a match for these entities, he couldn’t just sit back and do nothing.

“Hum!” The strange sound from the stone musical instrument echoed in front of the carriage. The sound wave dispersed the churning sonar waves and tsunamis at the same time, preventing them from getting close to the strange vehicle.

The nine black dragons stared at the strange vehicle covetously, but none of them lunged forward. They only watched as the strange vehicle slowly drove towards the other side of the sea.

Zhou Wen and company’s hearts raced. After the strange vehicle left the nine black dragons, Zhou Wen looked back and saw the nine obsidian-like dragons roaring at the sky as though they were venting their anger.

And beneath the sea, Zhou Wen discovered that the lower half of their bodies were connected, like a black mountain that had sunken into the sea. Only then did he realize that it wasn’t nine dragons, but a monster with nine heads.
