Chapter 938: Emperor of Shang’s Place

Translator: CKtalon

Now, Zhou Wen felt extremely uncomfortable. Not only was he under immense pressure, but he also felt dizzy as his heart raced.

Under the protection of the Dragon Scale Armor, his Demon Dragon True Body still felt his skin flush with blood. It was almost about to split the scales open.

What made Zhou Wen even more uncomfortable was that everything he saw was a mysterious, dazzling light. It was as though he was looking through a kaleidoscope. He couldn’t even see the ice castle and the ice maiden in front of him, nor could he hear their voices. His senses couldn’t be used normally. Only two of his senses remained effective.

Zhou Wen opened his mouth and realized that he couldn’t even speak or make a sound.

Zhou Wen felt as though he had fallen into a space of despair. The feeling nearly made him break down.

Could it be that the ice maiden wants to harm me? Zhou Wen was alarmed.

He hurriedly summoned Truth Listener. The ability Truth Listener gave him immediately restored his hearing, and the appearance of the ice castle and the ice maiden appeared in his mind again.

The ice castle and ice maiden remained the same. In Truth Listener’s hearing, everything was normal. However, when he used his senses to listen, he couldn’t see or hear anything. He didn’t even have a sense of touch.

Zhou Wen helplessly closed his eyes. As he couldn’t make a sound, he could only use his fingers to write in midair. “Why is this happening?”

“It’s impressive that you are able to maintain a portion of your bodily functions. This is the dimension, a space of a far higher level than Earth’s. Here, if your order in life isn’t up to standard, you won’t be able to see the existence of this world.” The ice maiden was somewhat surprised that Zhou Wen could still write with his body.

“I’ve been to the dimension before, but I didn’t feel this way,” Zhou Wen wrote again. He felt suspicious. He hadn’t felt this the last time he went to get the divine fruit.

“Then you definitely didn’t go to the real dimension,” the ice maiden said with certainty.

“It was definitely the dimension. I went to the divine tree which Teacher was guarding to pluck the divine fruit. Wasn’t that the dimension?” Zhou Wen wrote. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The ice maiden looked at Zhou Wen in surprise and said, “So the human who took the divine fruit is you. It’s no wonder an Epic like you could pick up the Heaven Shrouding Bell without being killed. From the looks of it, you are telling the truth. You are indeed Wang Mingyuan’s beloved disciple. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have suffered the pain of lightning smiting just to let you go. Although it was the dimension, the environment wasn’t that bad with the divine tree around. You have never experienced the real world of the dimension.”

“What lightning smiting?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he hurriedly wrote.

“Don’t you know?” The ice maiden thought for a moment and continued, “That’s right. You left after taking the divine fruit, so you naturally don’t know what happened after that. The divine fruit can be taken away, but the human who obtains it has to sign a contract to become the spokesperson of the dimension in the human world. Wang Mingyuan didn’t let you sign the contract before letting you return to Earth. Naturally, you have to be punished. The pain of the lightning smiting isn’t something anyone can endure. Even the closest relatives of the dimension’s species might not be willing to suffer in place of others. Yet, he endured so long for you. It’s not overboard to say that you are his most beloved disciple.”

Zhou Wen didn’t know what to feel as he immediately wrote again. “Teacher actually suffered so much for me. Can you take me to him?”

“It’s useless even if you go now. He’s already the supreme Dragon King. Even the Dragon King who punished him has been defeated. Who else dares to punish him? Don’t worry. He’s very well now. You have no idea how respected is,” the ice maiden said.

Zhou Wen felt a little more at ease, but he didn’t know how to repay Wang Mingyuan’s kindness.

“Are you going to see Emperor of Shang or Wang Mingyuan?” the ice maiden asked.

“Emperor of Shang,” Zhou Wen said through gritted teeth.

Even if he went to see Wang Mingyuan now, he didn’t have the ability to return the favor. Instead, he might cause trouble. Therefore, Zhou Wen decided not to meet Wang Mingyuan.

“If you can withstand the burden, follow me.” The ice maiden smiled as she walked out of the ice castle.

However, Zhou Wen felt as though every step he took was a fight against the world. It was extremely strenuous. Before he walked out of the ice castle, he felt his eyes blur and ears ring. His legs were so weak that he could barely stand.

“If you walk like this, it will probably take you days to reach the destination,” the ice maiden said to Zhou Wen as she stood at the entrance of the ice castle.

Zhou Wen knew that the ice maiden was waiting for him to beg her. When the time came, she would definitely raise more conditions.

Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and wanted to summon Tyrant Behemoth, but after taking a look, he realized that Tyrant Behemoth had been injured by the snake monster. Its injuries hadn’t healed yet, so it probably couldn’t withstand the dimensional forces.

After some thought, Zhou Wen summoned Torch Dragon Youngling. He wanted to see if Torch Dragon Youngling could withstand the dimensional forces and use it as a mount to take him to Emperor of Shang.

After Torch Dragon Youngling appeared, although its situation was slightly better than Zhou Wen’s, its actions were greatly restricted. It looked like its actions were very slow, completely lacking its usual speed.

“Torch Dragon?” The ice maiden looked at Torch Dragon Youngling in surprise. Clearly, she recognized Torch Dragon.

Furthermore, Torch Dragon was different from ordinary dimensional creatures. It was an existence with the potential to advance to the Calamity grade. Such dimensional creatures were very rare in the dimension. She never expected Zhou Wen to have a Torch Dragon Companion Beast.

Could it be that Earth is really the birthplace of the dimension? Otherwise, how could there be a dimensional creature like Torch Dragon? The ice maiden was alarmed.

Zhou Wen got Torch Dragon to use World King Transformation. Under the state of World King Transformation, Torch Dragon immediately could move easily. Under the state of World King Transformation, as long as it didn’t use the Bright Torch Vision World, it could still maintain its state for a period of time.

Zhou Wen rode on Torch Dragon’s back and said to the ice maiden, “Let’s go. I don’t have much time.”

The ice maiden nodded and led the way. Her footsteps were brisk. As for Torch Dragon, it could only barely follow behind after using all its strength.

After leaving the ice castle, Zhou Wen saw a stone staircase, but he couldn’t hear what was outside. It was as though he was enveloped by boundless fog.

As he followed the ice maiden through the fog, Zhou Wen could occasionally hear terrifying sounds coming from the fog. They were very strange and he couldn’t tell what they were from.

Here, Zhou Wen couldn’t sense the passage of time. He couldn’t estimate how long he had walked. When the ice maiden stopped, a strange building appeared at the end of the stone steps.

“Emperor of Shang is inside. Go in yourself. He probably doesn’t wish to see demons, so I won’t be entering,” the ice maiden said as she pointed at the strange building in front of them.
