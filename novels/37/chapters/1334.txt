Chapter 1335: Sweetie

“Young lady, what would you like to drink? The most famous thing in my shop is stockings milk tea… Of course, the pearl milk tea here is also very good…” The boss offered with a smile.

“Can I have both?” The blonde girl looked at the beautiful pictures on the brochure and asked expectantly.

“Of course, let’s get you a cup of my best stockings milk tea first.” The smile on the boss’s face deepened as he began to make the milk tea.

Soon, the boss brought a cup of milk tea to the blonde girl and placed it on the table. “Try it. I guarantee you that you won’t be disappointed. You definitely won’t be able to drink a second cup of milk tea that’s this smooth in the capital.”

The blonde girl took a sip of the milk tea and closed her eyes with a blissful expression.

“Is it delicious?” the boss asked.

“Yes, yes, it’s really delicious.” The blond girl took one sip after another and quickly finished the cup of milk tea. She then looked at the shop owner and asked, “You just said that there’s also pearl milk tea. Is it as delicious as this?”

“You’ll know once you try it.” The boss smiled and made a cup of pearl milk tea for the blonde girl.

“This tastes good too!” The blonde girl held the cup, her eyes almost melting from happiness.

Soon, the girl finished another cup of milk tea.

“Do you want to drink something else?” The boss came over and asked.

“Thank you, but there’s no need. I should go,” the blonde girl said as she walked out.

“Wait, you haven’t paid the bill yet?” The boss quickly stopped the blonde girl.

“Bill? What’s that?” The girl looked at the milk tea shop owner in confusion.

Sweetie genuinely didn’t know what money was. The last time she came to Earth was a long time ago. Moreover, at that time, someone took care of her, and Sweetie had never tried to use money.

“Don’t play dumb with me.” The boss’s expression changed immediately. The kind look from before disappeared and was replaced with a fierce look. He reached out to grab Sweetie’s arm and said fiercely, “How dare you drink milk tea when you are penniless? You better…”

The boss’s palm touched Sweetie’s arm, and his voice came to an abrupt halt. A golden light lit up at his fingertips. The golden light instantly spread to his entire body and turned him into gold.

It was real gold that even shone with a golden light. It was like a 24K pure gold statue. It still maintained a fierce expression while reaching out to grab Sweetie.

Sweetie looked at the boss who had turned into a golden statue. She sighed and shook her head, then walked out of the shop.

Soon, a customer came into the milk tea shop and was shocked to see the golden statue.

…

Zhou Wen took Ya’er, Chick, and the antelope to the capital. As he walked, he browsed the news on the Internet.

He originally wanted to see the recent situation in Forbidden City. He wanted to know if humans had already explored the interior. It would be best if he could obtain information about the interior of Forbidden City.

However, he didn’t find any information about the Forbidden City. Instead, he saw many media headlines reporting about golden statues.

Zhou Wen took a casual look and realized that there were suddenly many golden statues in the capital. These golden people looked identical to the real people in real life, and the gold was pure gold.

However, according to the investigation of the capital’s police station, every golden statue was built using real people as the template, and those who looked identical to the golden statue had all gone missing.

Everyone was discussing this matter. Some people suspected that a powerful dimensional creature had entered the capital and turned those people into golden statues.

Some people said that this was a prank. Some even said that this was a sign that a Calamity-grade creature was about to appear.

In any case, there were all kinds of things being said, causing everyone in the capital to be in a panic. Many people did not dare to go out, afraid that they would also turn into golden statues.

No wonder there are so few people on the streets in the capital. So that’s why.?Zhou Wen came to a realization. He had previously found it odd that the capital looked much more desolate than before.

In the beginning, Zhou Wen thought that after Xia Jiuhuang died, the Xia family declined, which led to the capital’s decline. It turned out that it was caused by the golden statues.

“Antelope, what do you think of these golden statues?” Zhou Wen read the news about the golden statues to the antelope.

After the antelope heard that, it frowned and pondered. “Although turning a person into gold isn’t a very powerful ability, it’s still a very rare ability. If a creature really has such an ability, it’s probably at the Mythical stage or above. The possibility of it being at the Terror grade is higher.”

“Since it’s possible to be above the Mythical stage, why is the possibility of being at the Terror grade higher? Can’t it be at the Calamity grade?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

“If it’s a Calamity-grade, it wouldn’t be just these few people turning into gold. Besides, unless a Calamity-grade has nothing better to do, why would they run around turning ordinary people into gold?” the antelope said.

Zhou Wen thought about it and realized that it made sense. However, this had nothing to do with them. Their destination was Forbidden City and they wouldn’t stay in the capital for long. Their luck was unlikely to be so unlucky to encounter the monster that could turn people into gold. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

As Sweetie walked, she sensed Zhou Wen’s aura. After arriving on Earth, she first went to Sweetie’s Hut before heading to the capital.

As Yana had sent information on Zhou Wen to Sweetie before she died, she could sense Zhou Wen’s aura and knew that he was approaching that direction. Therefore, she planned on waiting for him.

Sweetie had only wanted to wait quietly for Zhou Wen’s arrival, but she never expected humans to have declined to such a state. Every human who touched her turned into a golden statue without exception.

In fact, it was not Sweetie who intentionally turned them into golden statues. It was just an additional power that was automatically generated from her body. As long as it was a creature with evil intentions or a sinful person, they would turn into golden statues when they touched her.

If it was a kind-hearted person, there wouldn’t be any problems if they touched her. However, up until now, everyone who touched Sweetie had turned into gold.

Has humanity fallen to such a state? I can’t even find a kind person. It’s no wonder that bad person killed Yana. He must be a super bad person.?Sweetie had already sensed Zhou Wen’s arrival and walked towards him.

From afar, she saw Zhou Wen carrying Ya’er and walking down the street with the antelope and bird. Sweetie walked towards him.

Such a baddie will definitely turn into gold the moment he touches me. It can be considered revenge for Yana, Sweetie thought as she deliberately walked towards Zhou Wen.

When Zhou Wen saw Sweetie, he couldn’t help but take a few more looks. The blonde girl was just too beautiful. She was like a doll, one that looked flawlessly beautiful.

When Sweetie brushed past Zhou Wen, she seemed to accidentally slip. She staggered and fell towards Zhou Wen.
