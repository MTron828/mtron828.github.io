Chapter 1429: Huge Club

Zhou Wen was indeed in a terrible state. He had tried all sorts of powers, but he was ultimately unable to crack the influence Xiao’s Calamity Zone had on him.

Even if he wasn’t afraid of his identity being exposed, using the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was still unable to change his present disadvantage.

The Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation needed Zhou Wen’s control. If Zhou Wen couldn’t even control his body, how could he control the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation? When that happened, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation would collapse on its own and be useless.

If it’s not the power of misfortune, what could it be??Zhou Wen was puzzled. He really couldn’t figure out what kind of power eluded him.

This made Zhou Wen suspect that his judgment was wrong. Xiao’s domain power had nothing to do with faith.

However, he quickly eliminated this possibility. No matter how he looked at it, the domain was definitely related to the power of faith.

He’s almost at his limit. He shouldn’t be able to last much longer.?Sweetie stood not far from Zhou Wen with a rather ambivalent expression.

The wounds on Zhou Wen’s body worsened. There were sword holes everywhere on the Prisoned Dragon armor. The armor was almost completely dyed blood-red.

Thankfully, it was the Prisoned Dragon armor. If it were any other armor, Zhou Wen would have long been stabbed to death.

Even with the Prisoned Dragon armor’s Absolute Defense, it was on the brink of collapse. If this continued, it would probably shatter.

I can’t break the rules… But… But… But… I can’t let Zhou Wen die at the hands of others… Yes… I need to avenge Yana… I can’t let others kill him…?Sweetie seemed to convince herself as she thought to herself,?Besides, I’m not helping him. I’m just maintaining fairness. Mommy said that maintaining fairness is God’s responsibility; it’s not breaking the rules.

That human using the Calamity Zone to deal with a person without a domain is unfair in itself. Furthermore, I’m not trying to crack his domain. I’m just wiping away the blessing power within. This isn’t helping Zhou Wen at all. It’s wrong to use blessing powers on the enemy to begin with. This isn’t giving Zhou Wen an advantage. I’m just helping him get back on course. Yes, that’s right. In fact, I’m helping that person defeat Zhou Wen and avenge Yana.?Sweetie finally mentally steeled herself and was about to eliminate the blessing power in the Gods’ Zone.

However, before Sweetie did anything, Zhou Wen suddenly did something unexpected.

Zhou Wen extended his hand and beckoned as a white club appeared in his hand.

Sweetie couldn’t help but stop. For Zhou Wen to suddenly summon such a white club at such a time meant that he likely had some idea. Perhaps it was a secret weapon.

“That club looks a little big. Its offensive strength must be very powerful, right?”

“It looks very strong. It’s definitely Human Sovereign’s secret weapon.”

“Quickly kill that Xiao. It’s too stifling.”

Everyone widened their eyes as they wanted to see how Zhou Wen could turn the tables. Although the chances weren’t high, Human Sovereign must have some special use for summoning such Companion Beast equipment.

“Bro, do you know what Companion Beast that huge club is?” Zhang Yuzhi looked at Zhang Chunqiu. She had a deep understanding of Companion Beasts, but she didn’t know what Companion Beast it was.

“You are a Companion Beast expert yourself. If you don’t know it, I wouldn’t know either.” Zhang Chunqiu was being humble. His knowledge wasn’t inferior to Zhang Yuzhi’s, but he didn’t recognize what Companion Beast it was.

“However, for Human Sovereign to take it out at this moment and how it looks like a very domineering weapon, Human Sovereign is probably going to go all out,” Zhang Chunqiu said after some thought.

Many people shared the same thoughts as Zhang Chunqiu. They felt that at this stage, Human Sovereign was definitely going to risk his life.

All eyes were focused on the white club. It looked like it was made of crystal jade. It was thick and huge, bigger than an extra-large baseball bat.

In Human Sovereign’s hand, it looked especially imposing. It looked even more ferocious than the Immortal Culling Sword in his other hand.

“He’s moving!” someone shouted.

The club in Zhou Wen’s hand finally moved. Everyone held their breaths as they waited for Human Sovereign’s next shocking strike.

Some people even wondered if the huge club would destroy Xiao’s Calamity Zone.

Although people knew that it was almost impossible, they couldn’t help but fantasize.

Bang!

The club struck with all its might, but this strike left everyone dumbfounded. Their mouths gaped open as though they had swallowed a huge invisible duck egg. They stared blankly at the live broadcast.

Human Sovereign’s club wasn’t directed at Xiao, but at himself.

“What… What… What’s going on… Human Sovereign knows that he can’t win… Is he trying to commit suicide?” Xia Liuchuan’s mouth was agape for a long time before he finally said those words. His face was filled with disbelief.

Zhou Wen naturally didn’t wish to commit suicide. The huge club was actually transformed from Tai Sui. It looked rather domineering, but its offensive strength wasn’t strong. To Zhou Wen, who was wearing armor, such an attack couldn’t injure him at all.

The reason Zhou Wen did so was that he had thought of another possibility.

Xiao’s domain power was definitely related to faith. Zhou Wen had gone through all the various powers related to faith, and he finally thought of blessing powers.

The most direct want humans had when having faith in deities was naturally to obtain blessings. This was also the most basic power of deities.

Previously, Zhou Wen hadn’t thought of blessing because the power of blessing clearly had benefits. However, when he was stumped, he thought carefully about it.

After all, he had seen The Thearch’s power of wishes. Making wishes was beautiful, but The Thearch’s power of wishes could also be used for evil.

Then, blessing powers might not necessarily be absolutely positive. For example, words like “I wish your entire family XXX” often appeared on the Internet. Clearly, they weren’t very pleasant. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right.

Only such a seemingly friendly but actually very sinister power could bypass the Evil Nullification of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and Truth Listener and directly affect Zhou Wen’s body.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen’s body had been affected by the Calamity Zone for so long without being injured at all. Instead, he could vaguely sense that his muscles had strengthened a little.

With this in mind, Zhou Wen began considering how to crack the power of blessing.

Luck definitely wouldn’t work because a blessing was a seemingly pleasant power to begin with. Luck would only strengthen the power of blessing and not weaken him.

The higher the value, the greater the influence of the power of blessing. Good things might not necessarily have a good outcome.

In theory, he should use misfortune or some power to block blessing powers. Unfortunately, the Bamboo Blade had already shattered. Otherwise, it might have been of some use.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment before looking at Tai Sui’s Terror form. He realized that Tai Sui’s Terror form was something he had already seen before. A negative symbol would drop his luck, causing nothing to drop. He immediately had a thought and summoned Tai Sui after it turned into a huge club. He planned on giving it a try.
