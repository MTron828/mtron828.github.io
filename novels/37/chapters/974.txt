Chapter 975: Grown Up

“No good. It’s the Seven Seas Dragon King. I’ll hold it back. You guys return to the land first.” Miya had only been restricted previously; she wasn’t injured.

Although Feng Qiuyan had obtained the mysterious Mythical Companion Beast, its strength was too powerful. His body couldn’t withstand it if it attached itself to him in a soul form.

Previously, his body had already suffered damage from only using it briefly. It was obvious how powerful the Companion Beast was.

Miya rushed out of the cabin and immediately saw the Seven Seas Dragon King’s true body. Due to Dragon Granny’s death, he was already enraged and didn’t bother hiding. When he saw Miya come out, the seven dragon-like tentacles swept over.

Miya transformed into the Golden Dragon King and charged forward to fight the Seven Seas Dragon King.

Her body was no weaker than the Seven Seas Dragon King’s. It was even stronger than the Seven Seas Dragon King’s body. Golden beams of light shone resplendently, causing the seawater to surge and huge waves to appear on the surface of the sea.

The Turtle Minister also rushed forward with his spear and helped Miya attack the Seven Seas Dragon King.

However, the Turtle Minister wasn’t as fast as Miya. He was accidentally hit by the white liquid spewed out from the strange dragon’s mouth and was immediately stuck. It was as if he had been drenched by super glue. At first, he could still move, but soon, he couldn’t even move. He was sent flying by the strange dragon’s tentacles and smashed into the sand at the bottom of the sea.

Qin Ling helped the injured Feng Qiuyan swim towards the sea. A golden glow suffused her body as fine scales appeared on her skin. Her hair and pupils also turned pale golden.

Although she was still in human form, she didn’t look like a human. However, she wasn’t ugly. She just looked a little strange.

After transforming, Qin Ling’s speed in the water became extremely fast as she rapidly swam towards the coast with Feng Qiuyan.

Miya constantly fought the Seven Seas Dragon King. The terrifying Golden Dragon King body didn’t seem to be at a disadvantage. She was truly powerful.

However, she had yet to advance to the Terror grade. The Seven Seas Dragon King once again used the posture that resembled a Buddha chanting scriptures and entered the Terror transformation state.

Miya immediately felt that she had fallen into a heavy fog. She heard the chanting coming from all directions, but she couldn’t tell where the Seven Seas Dragon King was.

Suddenly, a strange dragon-like tentacle emerged from the fog and spat out white liquid at Miya.

Miya reacted extremely quickly as she twisted her dragon body to dodge, but other tentacles kept tearing out of the fog. Before Miya could react, she was immediately sprayed with white liquid.

Soon, Miya felt her body stiffen where the white liquid had hit. Her dragon claws were stuck to her body, making it abnormally difficult to brandish them.

More and more white liquid sprayed onto the Golden Dragon King Body. Miya was like a ferocious beast that had been bound. No matter how strong she was, it was useless. She was bitten by the Seven Seas Dragon King’s tentacles.

The seven strange dragons bit Miya’s body, but she couldn’t resist. Soon, she was covered in wounds. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The Seven Seas Dragon King clearly hated Miya to the core and didn’t devour her.

...

“Leave now... I want to go back and save my sister...” Qin Ling gritted her teeth and rushed back when she saw Miya’s Golden Dragon King form being ravaged by the Seven Seas Dragon King.

Feng Qiuyan grabbed her and forcefully pulled her to the shore. “It’s useless if you go back. Go ashore first.”

“I know it’s useless, but if I don’t return, I won’t be able to feel at ease for the rest of my life.” Qin Ling wanted to shake Feng Qiuyan off.

“Sorry, Sis Ling.” Feng Qiuyan lifted Qin Ling up and ignored her protests as he rushed to the coast.

At that moment, the coast was filled with surging seawater. The beach could no longer be seen. Even the trees outside were covered in seawater.

“Wait at a spot where there’s no water. You are not to get down.” Feng Qiuyan placed Qin Ling down before turning around and diving into the sea.

Qin Ling stared blankly at Feng Qiuyan’s figure as he rushed into the sea. She suddenly realized that this wasn’t the Feng Qiuyan she had known in the past.

The little boy that followed behind her all day like a tail, the affectionate boy who called her Sis Ling, these originally clear impressions suddenly became blurry. Replacing them was the feeling of a man, not a boy.

He... has really grown up...

Qin Ling’s expression was complicated. After some thought, she leaped onto a beacon beside her and waited for Feng Qiuyan in the sea.

...

After Feng Qiuyan descended into the sea, he quickly rushed back to where the Seven Seas Dragon King and Miya were fighting. The Golden Dragon King form that Miya had transformed into was severely injured.

Feng Qiuyan knew that he only had one chance. His body was already injured, so it was impossible for him to withstand the mysterious Companion Beast’s possession for long. He had to resolve the problem in one strike.

The Seven Seas Dragon King seemed to want to tear Miya apart. It thought that Miya had killed Dragon Granny, so he had a raging resentment.

This is a good opportunity. Feng Qiuyan summoned the mysterious Companion Beast and attached it to him in a soul form. After succeeding, Feng Qiuyan didn’t hesitate to draw his saber and slash.

It was the power of the wind. In an instant, it sliced through the seawater and slashed at the Seven Seas Dragon King’s body. However, when the blade struck the Seven Seas Dragon King, it was like a blunt blade slicing through a cow’s tendon. The strike with the strength of a Mythical Companion Beast only managed to slice through less than ten centimeters.

A ten-centimeter deep wound was fatal to humans.

However, to the massive Seven Seas Dragon King, it was nothing.

Bam!

With a flick of the strange dragon tentacle, Feng Qiuyan’s body was sent flying. He shot out of the sea like a cannonball with a huge splash.

As though he had had enough of the cat-and-mouse game, the Seven Seas Dragon King opened his main body’s mouth. It wanted to devour Miya alive so as to appease the hatred in its heart.

Miya was stuck to the white liquid and had no ability to resist. Knowing that it was impossible for her to live, she decided to transform into a human form and be swallowed by the Seven Seas Dragon King to prevent herself from being bitten and suffering so much pain.

...

“Feng...” Qin Ling’s expression changed drastically when she saw Feng Qiuyan being thrown out of the water. She hurriedly rushed over and hugged him.

Seeing that Feng Qiuyan wasn’t dead despite his serious injuries, Qin Ling felt a little more at ease. She glanced at the sea and gritted her teeth before rushing out of Sea God Reef with Feng Qiuyan in her arms.

Although she really wanted to rush back and fight with Miya, she couldn’t allow Feng Qiuyan to die in front of her.

Just as they rushed back to the coast, they saw a man in black armor standing on the coast like a nobleman, blocking their path.

“Qin Ling, you don’t belong to the world over there yet. Return with me. In the future, you will become the new human progenitor,” the black-armored man said slowly.
