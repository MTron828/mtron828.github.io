Chapter 1146: Meeting

Translator: CKtalon

When the girl beside them heard their conversation, she immediately sized them up suspiciously and asked, “Are you guys students from Bright Prospects College or not?”

Without waiting for Zhou Wen to answer, the girl seemed to come to a realization. “I get it. You aren’t students at Bright Prospects College, but like Professor Ming, you are tutors at Bright Prospects College. You are jealous of Professor Ming because of his popularity, right?”

With that said, the girl seemed to get where Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi were coming from. She reached out to pat Zhou Wen on the shoulder and said, “It’s not your fault that your talent and accomplishments aren’t as good as others, but to speak ill of others behind their backs out of jealousy is not a good thing. I can understand your feelings. Seeing the gap between yourself and a genius grow bigger and bigger really makes one feel despair. However, one has to be honest or one will easily suffer a beating. Many of the students here are fans of Professor Ming.”

Zhou Wen looked around and realized that there were indeed many students glaring at the two of them. Their conversation had already incited public anger.

Zhou Wen smiled and didn’t say another word. However, Tsukuyomi didn’t have the mindset of a human, nor did she care what humans thought. She continued, “The sword art is indeed very ordinary. I’m just telling the truth.”

The Tomorrow Sword Art is very ordinary? When the students beside them heard this evaluation, they were even more certain that Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen were jealous of Ming Xiu.

That was a sword art that had once killed a Terror-grade creature. If such a sword art was considered ordinary, then were the sword arts they cultivated even called sword arts?

All the students glared at Tsukuyomi. If it wasn’t because of her beauty, they probably would have spat at her.

The girl beside them had already confirmed that Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen were teachers from Bright Prospects College. They were jealous of Ming Xiu, so she decided to ignore them.

Some of the more radical students were eager to teach Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen a lesson.

Unfortunately, this was a venue on campus. They definitely couldn’t get into a brawl. This, in a way, saved their lives. If they really dared to rush forward, even if the tutors and the school’s leaders attacked together, they wouldn’t be able to escape being completely wiped out.

Thankfully, Tsukuyomi didn’t say anything else. Instead, she got up and prepared to leave the venue. She really seemed bored.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to get up and leave with her. He also knew that leaving now was the best choice. Otherwise, if those students really angered Tsukuyomi, the outcome would be unimaginable.

Upon seeing Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi leave, the students thought that they had left in embarrassment, so they ignored them.

The commotion attracted Ming Xiu’s attention. When Ming Xiu saw Zhou Wen’s figure, his body immediately trembled as an unbelievable look of pleasant surprise flashed in his eyes.

Zhou Wen felt Ming Xiu’s gaze and turned his head to nod at him.

Understanding Zhou Wen’s intentions, Ming Xiu held back his surprise and nodded in response. He stood on the podium and continued lecturing.

After leaving the venue, the two of them strolled around other places in the school. It only left Tsukuyomi very disappointed. She originally imagined that she could learn more of humanity’s scientific knowledge and technological products.

To her surprise, the school was filled with people teaching Essence Energy Arts and Essence Energy Skills. It was rare to see high-tech subjects. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

In fact, ever since dimensional creatures broke through the restrictions on a large scale, humans had no choice but to retreat into dimensional zones. The importance of physics, biology, and other subjects had declined greatly. Very few people focused on studying related subjects. Most of them only completed the compulsory classes in order to pass the tests. Most of their energy was spent on cultivation and hunting dimensional creatures.

“It’s boring. Let’s go.” After circling around, Tsukuyomi was already a little sick of it. Furthermore, she didn’t have the interest from before. She didn’t wish to stay here any longer. This was far from the school she had imagined.

“I’m meeting a friend. Let’s wait a while. Let’s have a break over there,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the flower bed not far away.

“That Swordsman Tomorrow is your friend?” Tsukuyomi seemed to have realized something. The silent communication between the two of them hadn’t escaped her notice.

“Yes.” Zhou Wen didn’t plan on hiding it. He knew that he definitely couldn’t hide his prior actions from Tsukuyomi.

If he hadn’t signaled to Ming Xiu just now, Ming Xiu might have jumped down from the podium. That would have been even worse.

The two of them sat down on the flower bed. It was rather quiet nearby.

“Your strength and realm are much stronger than that Swordsman Tomorrow. Why is he so famous, but those students don’t recognize you?” Tsukuyomi asked in puzzlement.

“I don’t like fame,” Zhou Wen said with a shrug.

Just as Tsukuyomi was about to say something, she saw a few students walking over. Furthermore, they were looking around as though they were searching for something.

“Why are you here? Did you see Professor Ming?” The girl who had been sitting beside Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi was among them. When she saw the two of them, her eyes lit up as she ran over with a few students.

She believed that Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi were Ming Xiu’s colleagues. Ming Xiu had previously headed in their direction and was likely looking for them. If she followed them, she might be able to encounter Ming Xiu.

She also felt that she had an obligation to let Ming Xiu know that the two of them were speaking ill of him behind his back. She wanted him to be careful of Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi.

In her eyes, Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi were scheming b*tches who acted differently on the surface. The kind and adorable Ming Xiu must have been fooled by them. He didn’t know their true colors and treated them as friends. Who knew if he might be secretly harmed by them in the future.

The more she thought about it, the more she felt that she should let Ming Xiu recognize these two scheming b*tches. Otherwise, he would inevitably suffer in the future.

Just as this was on her mind, she saw Ming Xiu walk over. This made the girl feel that her deduction was correct.

The girls surrounded him, wanting to tell Ming Xiu about the two scheming b*tches.

However, Ming Xiu’s figure flashed and passed through them. He ignored them and arrived in front of Zhou Wen.

“Coach, I finally get to see you again. I’ve missed you so much!” Ming Xiu gave Zhou Wen a hug.

Although everyone knew that Zhou Wen was in Luoyang and Ming Xiu had seen him in Luoyang over the past five years, Ming Xiu knew that it wasn’t the real Zhou Wen despite the person looking identical and flawless.

However, Ming Xiu kept this matter to himself and didn’t say it out loud. He felt uneasy, uncertain about what had happened to Zhou Wen. Only when he saw Zhou Wen today did he finally relax.

The girls widened their mouths as they looked at Ming Xiu and Zhou Wen. Their expressions turned abnormally odd as an ominous thought surfaced in their minds.

Could it be that Professor Ming likes men...
