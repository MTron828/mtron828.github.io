Chapter 686: Violent Annihilation

Tyrant Behemoth was extremely violent and ferocious as it constantly attacked. Its Absolute Strength had a time limit, and it had already used it for nearly ten minutes, Now that it was activated again, it only had about twenty minutes remaining. It needed to determine the victor in twenty minutes.

An Sheng didn’t attack the monk-robed skeleton with Tyrant Behemoth. He watched from the side as though he was observing and searching for an opportunity.

As Zhou Wen fought the golden-winged bird, the dragon wings on his back trembled. The two Golden Battle God Halberd attacked from both sides as the Golden Overlord Sword in his hand constantly slashed out Golden Sword Aura.

However, the golden-winged bird’s speed was just too fast. It was so fast that Zhou Wen’s eyes couldn’t keep up with its actions. Before he could see what was happening, he heard a crack. One of his Golden Battle God Halberds had been grabbed by its claws. Once it exerted strength, the Golden Battle God Halberd immediately snapped into several pieces.

Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to worry about the Golden Battle God Halberd’s death. He pushed Transcendent Flying Immortal’s speed to its limits and quickly escaped into the distance.

If Tyrant Behemoth had absolute strength, then the golden-winged bird had absolute speed. Zhou Wen didn’t fly for long before it caught up.

Without thinking, the eye mirror in Zhou Wen’s eye condensed a strange luster, making one of his eyes look like a mirror as he looked at the golden-winged bird.

The golden-winged bird seemed to sense danger. The mysterious ancient text on its wings shimmered as it vanished from Zhou Wen’s sight.

Boom!

Zhou Wen felt a heavy blow on his back. His body slammed into the ground like a meteor, leaving a huge hole in the golden palace.

The golden-winged bird’s might was even more ferocious. With a flash, it grabbed the Golden Battle God Halberd that was flying in the air and instantly snapped it into several pieces.

Zhou Wen crawled out of the ground and felt unbearable pain, but he wasn’t seriously injured. As for the Substitute Talisman, it had already dissipated into ashes.

Thankfully, I brought the Substitute Talisman. If I had known, I would have drawn a few more.

Zhou Wen was alarmed. If not for the Substitute Talisman, even if he didn’t die, the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon would have died.

Unfortunately, Substitute Talismans were too difficult to draw. Success or failure depended on fate. Zhou Wen had drawn so many of them, but he had only succeeded once when his heart and mind were one.

Later, he drew many more times, but none of them succeeded. Zhou Wen was too frustrated to continue drawing.

After the golden-winged bird snapped the Golden Battle God Halberd, its bloody, cold eyes looked into the palace’s hole. It flapped its wings again and instantly vanished. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

F**k you. Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as goosebumps rose. Knowing that danger was approaching, he didn’t dare hesitate any further as he summoned Torch Dragon Youngling.

Torch Dragon Youngling’s massive body appeared and burst through the palace. It looked up angrily at the sky.

Zhou Wen stood on its head and used the Truth Listener earring’s ability to observe his surroundings. He realized that the golden-winged bird had already flown into the sky. Clearly, it was afraid of Torch Dragon’s appearance.

However, in just an instant, the golden-winged bird turned ferocious again. It flapped its wings and transformed into a stream of light that vanished. It was so fast that he couldn’t see its trajectory.

“Torch Dragon!” Zhou Wen called out.

In fact, without Zhou Wen’s order, Torch Dragon had already moved. The scales on its body converged like eyelids as rows of Torch Dragon Eyes appeared. It was its World King Transformation.

Countless Torch Dragon Eyes used Bright Torch Vision World at the same time, opening up like countless mirrors.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen felt something amiss. He turned his head and saw the golden-winged bird appear behind Torch Dragon. Its body flashed like a bolt of lightning as its wings flapped wildly. Its face was filled with horror as though it was resisting some invisible terrifying force.

However, it only struggled for a moment before its figure suddenly vanished.

Zhou Wen saw the golden-winged bird’s figure appear in the eyes on Torch Dragon’s back. It struggled and churned inside before disappearing.

The Torch Dragon Vision World ended as Torch Dragon Youngling was taken out of its World King Transformation state. Torch Dragon Youngling was exhausted and its strength was greatly reduced. Its combat strength dropped drastically to the level of Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. It couldn’t even use Bright Torch Vision World again.

Zhou Wen hurriedly unsummoned Torch Dragon Youngling. He couldn’t let it take the risk. This was Zhou Wen’s strongest trump card.

What a huge loss.

Zhou Wen felt his heart ache.

He originally wanted to see if he could find an opportunity to kill the golden-winged bird, but he ended up losing a Substitute Talisman and two Golden Battle God Halberds.

Although Bright Torch Vision World was powerful, it didn’t leave anything behind after killing its opponent. This was a fatal flaw. Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to use the skill unless it was absolutely necessary.

Elsewhere, Tyrant Behemoth kept bombarding the monk-robed skeleton. Its powerful strength forced the monk-robed skeleton to retreat as its bones cracked.

However, the golden light on its body burned like flames, making its body seem like an immortal body. It immediately recovered from any injuries. Although Tyrant Behemoth had the upper hand, it ultimately failed to kill it.

Is Absolute Strength about to run out of time? Zhou Wen did the math and realized that there were about ten minutes left. However, from the looks of it, Tyrant Behemoth probably wouldn’t be able to kill the monk-robed skeleton in ten minutes.

Suddenly, An Sheng, who had been observing from the side, pressed his palm on the ground and vanished like a ghost.

At this moment, Tyrant Behemoth sent the monk-robed skeleton retreating a few steps with one punch, leaving it staggering.

An Sheng strangely crawled out from the ground behind the skeleton and leaped up. His finger was like a venomous scorpion’s stinger as he tapped at the back of the skeleton’s head.

He imprinted a mysterious character on the back of the monk-robed skeleton’s head. Zhou Wen recognized that it was the word “Quake,” one of Love Letter’s abilities.

Boom!

The crystal in the skeleton’s eye sockets was actually jolted out because of An Sheng’s finger strike. It flew out and landed on the ground.

The golden flames on the monk-robed skeleton’s body immediately vanished. Tyrant Behemoth’s attack followed up the chain of attacks. The monk-robed skeleton raised its fist in a panic to receive the attack.

Crack!

Without the augmentation of the crystal, the skeleton’s bony hand was shattered by Tyrant Behemoth and its body staggered backward.

The berserk Tyrant Behemoth pummeled the monk-robed skeleton repeatedly. It only took a few punches to shatter the skeleton’s hands.

The monk-clothed skeleton was sent tumbling to the ground. Tyrant Behemoth pressed one of its claws on its sternum, while the other struck its skull. With a few punches, the skull shattered.

Tyrant Behemoth lifted the skeleton’s cracked body with one hand and placed it into its mouth. It chewed a few times before swallowing it.

“Bro... Take a look to see if there are any Companion Eggs left behind...” Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless. What kind of pet was this? It ate anything it killed without leaving anything behind.

However, since it had swallowed and couldn’t spit it out, all Zhou Wen could do was quickly run over and pick up the crystal that An Sheng had forced out of the skeleton’s eye socket.
