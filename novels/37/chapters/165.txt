Chapter 166 Dissection

“An Jing, can you take us in?” Zhou Wen cast his gaze at An Jing. At that moment, he couldn’t be bothered about their differences anymore.

Now, Zhou Wen was afraid that the military would dissect their corpses, spelling doom to everything

“Sure, but I have one condition,” An Jing said after some thought.

“I promise to fight you. Take me in immediately,” Zhou Wen said straight away.

“I didn’t say I wanted to fight you,” An Jing said, surprising Zhou Wen.

“Then what do you want?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

“I haven’t thought about it yet. Just treat it as if you owe me one. I’ll tell you after I’ve thought it through.” After An Jing said that, she didn’t wait for Zhou Wen to rush her as she walked straight to the door.

“Hello, please show some identification.” The two soldiers who were guarding the door clearly recognized An Jing. However, after saluting her, they still kept her outside and did not let her in immediately.

An Jing seemed to have known this would happen, so she didn’t react in any special manner. She took out an identification card from her pocket before the soldiers allowed her to take Zhou Wen and Li Xuan into the encampment.

After asking where the morgue was, they went straight to it. She was no stranger to the military encampment here.

Zhou Wen was somewhat glad that An Jing was here. Otherwise, with the encampment so huge, it wouldn’t be easy for him and Li Xuan to come in and find the morgue.

Zhou Wen looked at his phone as he walked, only to see five flower buds appear on the glowing red Dead Man Tree.

The flower buds also looked like they were carved out of ruby. It was even more dazzling, but they exuded an evil aura. Through the ruby-like flower petals, he could vaguely see something inside, as if it were a beating heart.

“How many dead classmates are there?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Five.” Li Xuan thought for a moment before replying.

Zhou Wen was almost certain that Wang Lu and company’s deaths had something to do with the five flowers on the Dead Man Tree. However, he didn’t know what the five flowers meant, nor did he know what to do. He could only wait until he saw the corpses before deciding:

In the morgue, Deputy Inspector Qin Wufu and a few Epic experts stationed at Sunset College were listening to the forensics report.

“There are no obvious wounds or symptoms on the outside. We didn’t find anything through X-ray either. We can only perform an autopsy now before we decide the outcome,” said Coroner Yan Zhen.

“No, we can’t dissect them.” An Epic expert immediately rejected Yan Zhen’s words with a firm tone.

“If we don’t do an autopsy, it will be difficult to find the true reason for the deaths,” Yan Zhen said slowly.

“The daughter of the Wang family died here for no reason. If we were to dissect her body, how are we going to explain it to the Wang family when they arrive?” the Epic expert from before said.

“Since Wang Lu’s corpse cannot be dissected, we can first dissect the corpses of the other four,” said Yan Zhen.

“That would work.” the Epic expert’s tone softened significantly.

“You can’t dissect them.” However, Qin Wufu vetoed Yan Zhen’s suggestion.

“Why can’t we dissect them?” Yan Zhen asked as he looked at Qin Wufu.

“Although their bodily functions have stopped, they still have a tiny bit of life on them. They might not be truly dead yet. You can’t dissect them and kill them!” Qin Wufu said.

Yan Zhen laughed after hearing that. “Deputy Inspector, if we don’t dissect them now, we won’t be able to find the reason why they are in such a state. Then, what’s the difference between them and the dead? Now, all we need to do is dissect the other four students, and we might be able to find out the reason. Who knows, we might be able to save Wang Lu. This is the best choice we have right now, isn’t it?”

A few Epic officers also felt that this was a pretty viable plan. If Wang Lu could be saved, their problems would be greatly reduced.

“If Wang Lu can be saved, the others should be saved as well,” Qin Wufu said as he stared at Yan Zhen.

“Please forgive me for my inadequacies,” Yan Zhen said.

“All of you may leave. I’ll chat with Dr. Yan alone.” Qin Wufu waved his hand and dismissed everyone. They left the morgue, leaving only Yan Zhen and Qin Wufu behind. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

At this moment, Qin Wufu stared at Yan Zhen and said coldly, “Yan Zhen, I know that you can save them. You want to dissect them only because you want to know what kind of power has turned them into this.”

“Deputy Inspector, aren’t you thinking too highly of me? I’m just a doctor, not a god. I don’t even know what kind of injuries they have suffered, so how can I save them?” Yan Zhen nudged his glasses and said with an unperturbed expression.

“Speak. What condition do you want to save them?” Qin Wufu frowned.

“There’s no condition. Dissect four corpses and save one,” Yan Zhen said indifferently, licking his lips as he stared at the five corpses.

“They are living people, not your experimental subjects.” A furious expression appeared on Qin Wufu’s face.

“They’re real people if I save them. If not, they are just dead people. Using the dead as experimental subjects wasn’t even a big deal back in times of peace.” Yan Zhen’s tone sounded like he was saying something that was only right.

Qin Wufu was so angry that his face turned livid. If he didn’t know Yan Zhen well enough, he would probably have drawn his gun and killed this despicable fellow.

But now, he couldn’t do that. The only person who could save these five students was Yan Zhen.

Suppressing the anger in his heart, Qin Wufu said coldly, “Rescue these five students. I will apply for you to use the bodies of the dead soldiers for your experiments.”

“No, I want these four experimental subjects.” Yan Zhen categorically rejected Qin Wufu. There was no room for negotiation.

“Haven’t you always been wanting to experiment with the corpses of dead soldiers? If you miss this chance, you definitely won’t get another one. You’re giving that up just to dissect these four students. Is it worth it?” Qin Wufu looked at Yan Zhen and said.

“It’s worth it. These five people are in a very strange state. If I dissect them, it might be of great help to my research. I want to see what kind of power is at work,” said Yan Zhen.

“I will definitely not give you this opportunity,” said Qin Wufu angrily.

“You have no choice. If I don’t save them, Wang Lu will also die. Should I let Wang Lu die with the four of them, or let the four die while Wang Lu lives? Deputy Inspector Qin, make your choice.” Yan Zhen looked at Qin Wufu with certainty, as though he was certain that Qin Wufu could do nothing about him.

Qin Wufu stared intently at Yan Zhen, wishing that he could slay this bastard with his saber. However, he knew that it was useless even if he killed him. Yan Zhen definitely wouldn’t yield unless he achieved his goals. Killing him made no difference.

Furthermore, killing Yan Zhen meant Wang Lu was doomed.

Just as Qin Wufu was about to compromise, he suddenly heard the door to the morgue being pushed open. He could not help but be enraged as he shouted coldly, “Get out! Who let you in?”
