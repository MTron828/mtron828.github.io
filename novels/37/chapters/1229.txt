Chapter 1230: Grim Reaper No. 10

He withstood the shot! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.

Although he had withstood the shot at the cost of his life, it was still a huge improvement compared to other Terror-grade creatures.

Bang!

Another gunshot sounded as the skeleton was reduced to dust. However, its body quickly reformed and walked towards the door that shot the bullet.

“He blocked it again?” In the League of Guardians, Immortal’s eyes narrowed.

The four Heavenly Kings were also surprised. As long as one could withstand the shots, there was still hope. The most terrifying thing was the inability to withstand the shots at all. That would imply zero chance.

It wasn’t just the League of Guardians. Many big shots had strange looks in their eyes when they saw this scene. They were secretly considering the various possibilities.

Everyone’s first thought was to find an existence like the skeleton to block the gunshots.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The skeleton was blasted apart again and again, but it repeatedly stood up. It was obvious that the skeleton possessed very special abilities. It wasn’t as simple as self-healing; otherwise, he would have long died.

Just as everyone believed that they had finally seen a ray of light, the skeleton’s body was once again blasted apart from the seventh gunshot. However, this time, the skeleton’s body directly disintegrated.

Clang! Clang!

An oval bone object dropped from the skeleton’s dispersed body, producing a series of crisp and ear-piercing sounds.

Zhou Wen reacted extremely fast. He instantly sobered up and teleported over to grab the bone object before teleporting out of the Venusian dimensional zone.

“That actually works... He takes advantage of both sides... He loots both parties...” Everyone was dumbfounded.

“All the advantages have been taken by Looter King.”

“It’s his ability to loot. If you have the ability, try doing so too.”

“That’s right. Looter King’s spatial teleportation ability is really powerful.”

“The Guardian from before serves as a lesson. It’s not that easy to take advantage of the situation.”

Ordinary people were discussing the matter of the Looter King, but existences like the League of Guardians’ upper echelons weren’t focused on Zhou Wen. They wanted to know why the skeleton had died.

Did the skeleton’s abilities reach their limits, or did the dimensional creature’s abilities behind the door undergo new changes?

“Cave Era, can you analyze the seventh shot?” Immortal asked Cave Era.

Cave Era was good at time. If anyone could figure out something, it would be her.

“I need to give it a try. I need to use some supplementary items to circulate the power of time to reforge the gunshot’s progression,” Cave Era said after some hesitation.

“How long will it take?” Immortal asked.

“At least three days,” Cave Era answered.

The Ultimate Family Clan of the North District.

“Sadie, did you see it?” Lance and company looked at Sadie. Sadie, who had the Eye of Odin, was the person who was most likely to see the seventh shot clearly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“That shot was too fast. It’s still difficult to discern it clearly when I slow it down. I need some time to analyze it,” Sadie said helplessly.

...

The same situation kept happening in the various major powers. The analysts of the various factions began taking action.

Zhou Wen didn’t analyze the shot. At that moment, he was hugging a bone and smiling foolishly.

I’ve made a killing... I’ve made a huge killing this time... Zhou Wen hugged the oval bone and was just short of kissing it.

This was actually the skeleton’s Companion Egg. Furthermore, his stats and abilities were so powerful that Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed.

There was no need to mention how powerful Grim Reaper No. 10’s combat strength was. Its strongest point was that it had an undying body and indestructibility. This was the key to its ability to withstand the Calamity-grade forces.

In terms of offensive strength, Grim Reaper No. 10 was top-notch among the Terror grade, but compared to the Calamity grade, he was still slaughtered.

However, its Life Providence and Wheel of Destiny allowed it to have extremely powerful survival abilities.

Zhou Wen hatched Grim Reaper No. 10 and took it into the game. This time, he wasn’t going to the Venusian dungeon, but to have his Terror-grade Companion Beasts attack Grim Reaper No. 10.

Grim Reaper No. 10’s body was destroyed again and again. It was repeatedly destroyed seven times, but it still managed to recover.

Zhou Wen kept trying, but no matter how many times he tried, Grim Reaper No. 10 could recover. Clearly, the reason it was killed by the seventh shot wasn’t because its abilities had reached their limits, but because the Calamity-grade power had undergone a special change.

The various factions could only use their present information to analyze it, but Zhou Wen had an additional advantage. With Grim Reaper No. 10, he could enter the game to experiment again and again.

This was much more effective than using other Terror-grade Companion Beasts to forcefully withstand the attack. It was also more likely for him to figure out the secret of the seventh shot.

Unfortunately, the twenty-four hours weren’t up. Zhou Wen couldn’t immediately take Grim Reaper No. 10 into the Venusian dungeon.

As for entering the Venusian dimensional zone in real life, Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t go unless he tailed others to loot the spoils.

The various families were secretly taking action. Their targets were basically locked onto Guardians or Companion Beasts with spatial and powerful immortality abilities.

Only with these two powers could one successfully take down the Venusian dimensional zone. Otherwise, no matter how many people went, they would only be sending themselves to their deaths.

After Grim Reaper No. 10, no creature challenged the Venusian dimensional zone again.

Zhou Wen kept grinding and finally managed to wait out the twenty-four hours . He immediately led Grim Reaper No. 10 into the game’s Venusian instance dungeon.

Perhaps he had used up all his luck in reality, but when he attempted the Venusian instance dungeon again, not even a Metal Guard Companion Egg dropped. much less a Golden Battle God Companion Egg.

However, none of this was important. All Zhou Wen wanted to know was why Grim Reaper No. 10 died from the seventh shot.

The alarm sounded as Zhou Wen used Great Brahma’s power. At the same time, he pushed Truth Listener’s ability to its limits. He also wanted to analyze the secret of the seventh shot.

Bam!

The sound of a gunshot rang out. Even someone as powerful as Grim Reaper No. 10 had his body blasted apart.

Thankfully, Grim Reaper No. 10 quickly recovered. Just like in reality, he received the shots over and over again. Grim Reaper No. 10 was repeatedly killed and revived.

The first six shots were identical to the ones in reality, but Zhou Wen still observed them carefully. He had to find the difference between the seventh shot and the first six shots.

Bang!

Finally, the seventh gunshot sounded. Grim Reaper No. 10 died as his body was reduced to ashes. Just like in reality, he couldn’t revive.
