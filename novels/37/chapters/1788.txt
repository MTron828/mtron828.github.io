Chapter 1789 Mythical Divide

“Why?” Li Xuan asked in puzzlement.

“What do you think is the greatest disaster for humans after the dimension’s descent?” Jing Daoxian asked with a smile.

“Of course it’s those terrifying dimensional creatures,” Li Xuan said matter-of-factly.

“You’re still too young,” Jing Daoxian said with a pout.

“Stop putting on an act. What else can it be?” Li Xuan retorted indignantly.

Jing Daoxian glanced at Li Xuan and narrowed his eyes. “If two countries were to fight and your family ended up getting killed, do you think it would be more unacceptable if your family was killed by the enemy or betrayed by your own people?”

Li Xuan’s heart skipped a beat. “You mean that Wang Mingyuan has been betrayed by his own people?”

“Hehe, it’s worse than that.” Jing Daoxian chuckled coldly. “Since ancient times, the most despairing thing in every calamity isn’t the calamity itself. The human heart is often crueler than a calamity.”

Zhou Wen, who had been silent, suddenly recalled the question Wang Mingyuan had asked them.

If the person you loved the most was insulted and he didn’t have the strength to resist the enemy, would he choose to fight at the risk of his life or endure the humiliation and join the enemy to seek revenge?

Back then, Zhou Wen had believed that the enemy Wang Mingyuan mentioned was the dimensional creatures. From the looks of it, if Jing Daoxian wasn’t fooling them, the enemy Wang Mingyuan mentioned might not be the dimensional creatures.

“Old fellow, can you not speak in riddles? If you have anything to say, just say it.” Li Xuan’s curiosity was piqued.

“I also want to make it clear, but unfortunately, I’m not sure,” Jing Daoxian said slowly.

......

“After all this time, you don’t know anything, and here you are bullsh*ting!” Li Xuan said unhappily.

“Even I have to admire a shrewd person like Wang Mingyuan. I don’t know much about him, but according to my investigations, he was once married and had children. Have you heard him mention them?” Jing Daoxian wasn’t angry as he continued speaking slowly.

“That’s impossible. Wang Mingyuan has never been married, much less had children. Everyone knows that,” Li Xuan immediately retorted.

“You’re free to believe anything you want. It’s not the first time I’ve worked with him. This is all I’ve found out. I can say with certainty that he had a wife and children, but they’re gone now,” Jing Daoxian said indifferently.

Before Li Xuan could say anything else, Jing Daoxian continued, “Actually, it doesn’t matter if it’s real or fake. You will know the outcome soon.”

Zhou Wen knew what Jing Daoxian meant. If it was really as Jing Daoxian had said, that Wang Mingyuan once had family and they had been harmed by humans, then once Wang Mingyuan became the ruler of the dimension, he would definitely return to Earth to do something

“How do you want to cooperate?” Zhou Wen stared at Jing Daoxian.

“Wang Mingyuan’s strength is probably invincible. There’s only one way to restrain him.” Jing Daoxian enunciated each word clearly. “Chess Mountain.”

When he heard the words “Chess Mountain,” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred.

Back then, he had made two bets with The Thearch. One of the bets was proposed by Zhou Wen. The two of them bet that Zhou Wen would live longer than The Thearch. This bet was still ongoing.

Another bet was that Zhou Wen would regret killing Transcendent Immortal. From the looks of it, Zhou Wen had lost the bet.

He did regret killing Transcendent Immortal. The Thearch had actually predicted this outcome back then. It was obvious that she had long seen through Wang Mingyuan’s scheme.

Zhou Wen really wanted to ask The Thearch why Wang Mingyuan was doing this, but he didn’t.

Zhou Wen had already lost the first bet. If he went to see The Thearch now, she could kill him and win the second bet.

Therefore, Chess Mountain was undoubtedly the most dangerous place for Zhou Wen.

Jing Daoxian had now mentioned Chess Mountain. Countless thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.

“Why Chess Mountain?” Zhou Wen stared at Jing Daoxian and asked.

“Because it’s very likely to have the answer that everyone wants. The answer regarding the dimension,” Jing Daoxian continued. “If you are careful enough, you should be able to tell that there’s a very clear watershed in ancient myths. It’s before and after the Shang dynasty.”

“What’s the difference?” Li Xuan didn’t understand what Jing Daoxian meant.

“Lad, read more when you have the time,” Jing Daoxian said disdainfully. “In the myths before the Shang dynasty, be it Pangu, Nüwa, or the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the relationship between humans and gods was equal. And after the Shang dynasty, immortals became high and mighty. The status of humans plummeted. Even the emperors of the human world called themselves the Son of Heaven. To put it nicely, they were under the orders of the heavens and had destinies determined by the heavens. To put it bluntly, they were the representatives designated by the gods. They were just lackeys. After the Shang dynasty, there was no human king.”

“What has this got to do with the dimension?” Li Xuan was still puzzled.

“Apart from Chess Mountain, have you seen any of the dimensional zones on Earth before the Zhou dynasty?” Jing Daoxian asked.

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were taken aback. They had never seen dimensional zones before the Zhou dynasty.

“The dimensional zones on Earth can be related to myths and legends, but have you seen dimensional zones related to mighty figures like Pangu, Nüwa, Hou Yi, and Kuafu? The connection between all dimensional zones and myths ends at the Shang dynasty. It’s as though they have been sliced into two…” Jing Daoxian’s eyes were fervent. “The source of everything lies in the Shang dynasty, and Chess Mountain is the origins of the Shang dynasty. It’s here where we can solve the mystery of all of this. Perhaps we can obtain what we want.”

“After all that talk, this is just an unfounded guess.” Li Xuan curled his lips and continued, “I remember that Feng Qiuyan’s hometown has dimensional zones related to Human Ancestor Fuxi. Guide also has Human Sovereign Suirenshi’s dimensional zone. These are all myths from before the Shang dynasty.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Suirenshi is a human, not a myth. As for Fuxi, he’s probably inextricably linked to Chess Mountain,” Jing Daoxian said.

“That’s a little ridiculous. Do you really think I’m uneducated? What has Fuxi got to do with Chess Mountain?” Li Xuan said disdainfully.

“Then tell me, who started the war that destroyed the Shang dynasty?” Jing Daoxian asked.

“Nüwa.”

“What’s the relationship between Nüwa and Fuxi?” Jing Daoxian asked again.

“I think they’re siblings?” Li Xuan said with some uncertainty.

“Some say siblings, others say husband and wife—no matter which one it is, it means that the relationship between the two isn’t simple. And all the ancient myths stop at the Shang dynasty. The only one that can be tied to ancient mythology is the Shang dynasty. Why is that?” Jing Daoxian said seriously, “Perhaps we can obtain the answer after cracking Chess Mountain.”
