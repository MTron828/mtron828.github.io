Zhong Ziya’s dead?

Zhou Wen stood there in a daze for a long time. Although human lives weren’t that precious in this era, with life-and-death separations happening almost every day, Zhou Wen never expected Zhong Ziya to die one day.

To be honest, Zhou Wen hadn’t interacted with Zhong Ziya for long, but his death left Zhou Wen feeling odd.

It was akin to always being with one’s parents and siblings. One wouldn’t have any particularly deep feelings for each other, with people sometimes finding the other party especially annoying, but if something really happened to the other party, indescribable, uncontrollable feelings would erupt.

“Don’t be rash. In fact, what I said previously wasn’t what Zhong Ziya wanted me to pass on to you. What he really said is that if he loses, no one is to go again. Wait for the opportunity to become powerful enough,” Jiang Yan said as he pressed down on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.

“When do we wait till?” Zhou Wen muttered to himself.

“I know you have a powerful dimensional weapon. Perhaps that weapon has the power to fight Transcendent Immortal, but Zhong Ziya’s defeat has already highlighted a problem. External forces are ultimately external forces. If your strength doesn’t reach that level, your body will be a fatal weakness when facing the Apocalypse grade,” Jiang Yan said slowly. “You still need to wait. At the very least, you have to ensure that you can survive. Otherwise, even if you go, you won’t be able to avenge Zhong Ziya, much less save Teacher. You will just be throwing another life at them.”

Zhou Wen was a very rational person, so he understood Jiang Yan’s words.

Zhong Ziya’s abilities were already very strong. Transcendent Immortal had also given him enough opportunities to grow to the point of being able to resist the power of the New World, but he had ultimately been defeated so tragically.

Zhong Ziya’s lacking level was his fatal weakness, and it was also applicable to Zhou Wen.

The Terror grade… is indeed too low… With this in mind, Zhou Wen’s eyes became more resolute.

Without a word, Zhou Wen suddenly used spatial teleportation and left Guide Ancient City.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t head to the divine mountain or the Cube. Instead, he arrived outside Chess Mountain.

Yes, Jiang Yan was right. If he was the weakness, he wouldn’t be able to save Wang Mingyuan even if he went, much less avenge Zhong Ziya. Therefore, he wanted to break through from his current level.

The Apocalypse grade was too far away, but Zhou Wen was still one step short of advancing to the true Calamity grade. As long as he advanced the Demon God Bloodline Catalog he had obtained from Chess Mountain to the Calamity grade, he could truly advance to the Calamity grade.

However, he couldn’t obtain the Zone Core from Chess Mountain even in-game. However, there was a shortcut—The Thearch.

On the black mountain wall, the flower was as beautiful as ever. It looked a little frail, as though a strong gust of wind could snap it.

“You’re finally here.” The Thearch wasn’t surprised by his appearance as though she had expected Zhou Wen to come.

“How can the Demon God Bloodline Catalog advance to the Calamity grade?” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to beat around the bush with The Thearch as he directly revealed his goal.

“It’s very simple. As long as I’m willing, the Demon God Bloodline Catalog can be advanced to the Calamity grade at any time,” The Thearch said with a smile.

“State your conditions.” Zhou Wen was already prepared to pay the price. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You know very well what I want,” The Thearch said indifferently.

“Impossible.” Zhou Wen naturally knew very well that The Thearch had always hoped to use his strength to escape, so he had always refused to visit Chess Mountain.

“Then it’s also impossible for you,” The Thearch said calmly.

“This is the last time I’m coming to Chess Mountain. Give me an acceptable condition or we’ll go our separate ways from now on.” Zhou Wen was prepared to pay the price, but the price was definitely not to let The Thearch escape.

“What a naive child. Do you think this path belongs to you?” The Thearch teased.

Zhou Wen naturally knew that it wasn’t that he could sever ties with The Thearch just because he said so.

“I want to kill Transcendent Immortal, so if I were to be killed by her, all those paths will have nothing to do with me if I don’t return,” Zhou Wen said calmly.

“You aren’t her match. Even if you have the golden Three-Eyed God, it won’t work. The golden Three-Eyed God is very strong, but you are too weak,” The Thearch said.

“That’s why I came to you,” Zhou Wen said.

“You are using your life to threaten me. Don’t you find this ridiculous? Why should I care about your life? Do you really think that no one other than you can help me escape?” The Thearch’s voice turned cold.

“Yes, that’s what I think,” Zhou Wen said bluntly.

The Thearch seemed to be taken aback. She never expected Zhou Wen to be so straightforward. Moments later, she suddenly said with a laugh, “Although I really want to say that you are nothing, unfortunately, just as you said, only you can help me escape.”

Zhou Wen was the one taken aback this time. Although he had guessed it long ago, he never expected The Thearch to admit it so bluntly.

“However, your usefulness is only limited to the time before Earth’s seal is completely lifted. Now, Earth can only last for two years at most, so your usefulness will only last two years,” The Thearch said.

“I won’t give you even a second.” Zhou Wen didn’t know if The Thearch was telling the truth. Even if it was true, he wouldn’t release The Thearch ahead of time.

“Hehe…” It was unknown if she was laughing out of anger, but The Thearch laughed so hard that the flower bent its waist.

“Alright, alright, alright. If you want the Zone Core, I can give it to you, but it depends on whether you have the guts to bet with me.” The Thearch continued laughing happily as though she wasn’t angry at all.

“What do you want to bet on?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I’m betting that you will regret it,” The Thearch said meaningfully.

“Regret what?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

“Regret killing Transcendent Immortal,” The Thearch said.

Zhou Wen never expected The Thearch to bet on this. After some thought, he said firmly, “I definitely won’t regret it.”

He could naturally wait, but Wang Mingyuan couldn’t. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to experience seeing the people he cared about die again. Even if his fate was unpredictable, he wouldn’t regret it even if he died in battle.

“Then make a contract with me. If you regret it, something on you will belong to me,” The Thearch said with a smile.

“What is it?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I don’t know. Perhaps it’s your life, your eyes, or your soul. No matter what it is, you can’t reject it, right? If you want to obtain something, you have to pay the price. If you aren’t willing to pay anything and don’t wish to take any risks, you can leave now,” The Thearch said coldly.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen knew that making a bet with The Thearch was no different from making a deal with a devil, but he really couldn’t wait any longer. Furthermore, even if he was defeated, he definitely wouldn’t regret his choice.

“Then make a contract with me…” The Thearch slowly stipulated the contract and got Zhou Wen to repeat it.

After Zhou Wen heard the contents of the contract and carefully thought about it, he felt that there was no problem before repeating it.

“Very well. As you wish. The Zone Core you want is there…” The flower’s flower trail spun as a petal fell.

After the petal fell, a figure appeared out of thin air in front of Zhou Wen. It was a beautiful woman.

The woman floated in the air with a blank expression. She couldn’t move her body, and her eyes were filled with shock when she saw Zhou Wen.
