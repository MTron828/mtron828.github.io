Chapter 1398: Evolving to the Calamity Grade

Zhou Wen knew that ordinary creatures needed to trigger a Calamity when advancing to the Calamity grade. He just didn’t know if such a situation would happen when a Companion Beast advanced to the Calamity grade.

Regardless, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to take the risk. He stored the Soul Mirror into the chaos space.

Zhou Wen sank his consciousness into the chaos space and continued observing the changes in the Soul Mirror.

If the Soul Mirror can really advance to the Calamity grade, what kind of ability will it have? Can the Calamity-grade Soul-Washing Divine Light directly turn a Calamity-grade creature into an idiot??Many thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind.

The Soul Mirror became more and more transparent, but the woman’s figure wasn’t completely revealed. She remained blurry and indiscernible despite being visible.

Not long after, the Soul Mirror’s mirror was about to turn transparent. Zhou Wen was worried that he wouldn’t be able to see it when it subsequently turned invisible. What if he accidentally shone it onto himself?

Suddenly!

Rainbow beams of light spewed out from the Soul Mirror, instantly melting a large area of the chaos fog in the chaos space. Zhou Wen felt a pain in his consciousness and couldn’t help but be alarmed as he hurriedly retracted his consciousness.

Even so, he still felt dizzy and his mind went blank for a moment. His consciousness had suffered quite a bit of damage. If he had retreated any later, his consciousness might have been completely destroyed. He would probably have become an idiot.

Thankfully, I put away the Soul Mirror. Otherwise, based on the range of the rainbow beam, the An family would definitely have been wiped out, even if it didn’t affect Luoyang.?Zhou Wen felt a lingering fear when he thought about it.

Although he didn’t have a good impression of An Tianzuo, it would be too much to destroy the An family. Furthermore, his father, Ouyang Lan, An Sheng, and company were all here.

In the future, when Companion Beasts advance to the Calamity grade, I have to place them in the chaos space.?Zhou Wen didn’t know when the Soul Mirror would finish its evolution, nor did he dare spy on the situation in the chaos space. All he could do was temporarily wait.

Zhou Wen carefully recalled the entire process of the Soul Mirror’s advancement. Before he could figure out why it had suddenly advanced to the Calamity grade, he saw An Sheng walk into the garden.

“Young Master, someone has entered the Venusian dimensional zone again,” An Sheng said.

“Who is it?” Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng’s expression and knew that the person was likely someone he knew.

“Immortal of the League of Guardians,” An Sheng answered.

Zhou Wen hadn’t told anyone that Jiang Yan was Immortal, so An Sheng didn’t know that Immortal was Jiang Yan.

However, even if he knew, the animosity between Jiang Yan and the An family wouldn’t change much. This was because Zhou Wen already knew that Jiang Yan was Cave Era’s younger brother, and both Cave Era and Uesugi Nao came from overseas. Jiang Yan was likely from overseas as well which made him an enemy of the Federation.

Jiang Yan’s previous attendance at Sunset College was probably not just for studying. It was very likely that he was a spy.

Zhou Wen and An Sheng went to the Cube to watch Jiang Yan attempt again.

When Zhou Wen arrived at the Cube, Jiang Yan had already entered the Venusian dimensional zone. Furthermore, he had killed all the Metal Guards. The first Golden Battle God was about to come out.

The last time someone from the League of Guardians challenged the level, Jiang Yan didn’t come personally. This time, only Jiang Yan came.

After the Golden Battle God came out, he attacked Jiang Yan. Frost bullets shot at him like streams of light.

Jiang Yan was still wearing the Skyimmortal armor. Fairy Burial was not seen.

However, just the Skyimmortal armor was rather terrifying. When the freezing bullets struck the Skyimmortal armor, they exploded into an icy mist, but they failed to injure it at all.

As expected of a Calamity-grade Guardian.?Zhou Wen was secretly envious.

An Sheng had obtained five Golden Battle God Companion Beasts from Zhou Wen, so he naturally knew how powerful the Golden Battle God was. Seeing that the Frost Bullets couldn’t injure Immortal, he was immediately alarmed. “Calamity-grade? Immortal’s Guardian has actually advanced to the Calamity grade!”

“Is there a need to be so surprised? The League of Guardians took so many dimensional resources. Isn’t it normal to advance to the Calamity grade?” Zhou Wen said guiltily. He didn’t dare say that Jiang Yan had advanced to the Calamity grade because of him. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

An Sheng suddenly turned to look at Zhou Wen and sized him up.

“Why are you looking at me?” Zhou Wen forced himself to calm down.

“Young Master, didn’t you make a trip to the League of Guardians previously? I didn’t hear you mention that Immortal is at the Calamity grade,” An Sheng said as he stared at Zhou Wen.

“That isn’t something honorable for me to profess. What’s there to say?” Zhou Wen said.

“That’s not right. It doesn’t seem like you, Young Master. When you saw that Immortal was at the Calamity grade, your emotions didn’t change at all. You should have known long ago. It’s obvious that you saw him in the League of Guardians. To be able to see the Calamity-grade Immortal and return in one piece, as well as him not coming to Luoyang to cause trouble, there’s a huge problem in all of this,” An Sheng said slowly as he stared at Zhou Wen.

“What problem can there be?” Zhou Wen pretended not to care.

An Sheng seemed to see through Zhou Wen’s thoughts as he revealed a strange smile. “Young Master, with your temper, if there’s danger, you will definitely give a warning. However, you didn’t mention anything about Immortal being a Calamity-grade when you returned. This means that you don’t think it’s a threat. However, how can a Calamity-grade Immortal not be a threat? I believe there are only two possibilities. One is that your strength has already exceeded the Calamity-grade Immortal. Immortal isn’t your match, so he naturally wouldn’t dare come to Luoyang to cause trouble. There’s no need to give the warning. Another possibility is that you know Immortal and are aware that Immortal won’t attack you or Luoyang, so you didn’t say anything.”

Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng with an ambivalent expression as he thought to himself,?Can An Sheng read minds? How did he guess it right?

An Sheng continued, “Young Master, you are relatively cautious. Even if you have the ability to defeat Immortal, you should have given me the warning. I think the latter is more likely.

“Young Master, are you really very familiar with Immortal? Can you tell me who he is?” An Sheng seemed to have turned his doubts into affirmation as he pressed on.

“Since you are so good at guessing, guess it yourself,” Zhou Wen said expressionlessly.

“I’m stumped. Young Master, you are still the best. You have a wide social circle.” An Sheng lowered his head.

When Zhou Wen heard An Sheng’s words, he knew that An Sheng had most likely guessed it. This was because Zhou Wen didn’t have a wide social circle. He only knew a few people, so it wasn’t difficult to work it out.

Zhou Wen pretended not to hear him as he continued watching Jiang Yan clear the level.

The Golden Battle God was blasted apart by Immortal with a wave of his hand. The Golden Battle Gods that appeared next were the same. They couldn’t injure Immortal at all as they were all destroyed with a wave of his hand.

None of this was surprising. What Zhou Wen really wanted to know was how Jiang Yan planned on dealing with the sure-kill seventh bullet.

Does he want to rush to the Golden Palace before the seventh bullet??As Zhou Wen was pondering, Immortal had already walked into the opened tunnel.

His speed didn’t seem fast. Every step he took made him look like a normal person walking, but with every step he took, his figure had already traveled extreme distances. His speed was even faster than ordinary Terror-grade creatures running at full speed.

The first shot finally sounded. When their eyes focused, people realized that Immortal had a bullet between his fingers. He had actually used his fingers to clamp down on the Calamity-grade attack.
