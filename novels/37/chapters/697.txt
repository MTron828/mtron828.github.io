Chapter 698: Magical Hourglass

A petite fire phoenix flew down from the wall. With terrifying flames, it instantly turned the entire stone house into a sea of flames.

Despite wearing armor, the red-hot flames were still scorching hot.

Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and swallowed the flames, along with the fire phoenix.

Although it was only for a short moment, An Sheng and Zhou Wen broke out into a cold sweat. White smoke was billowing from their armor. If it had been a little longer, their armor would have been burned red, and their flesh would have been cooked.

Once the fire phoenix died, the six doors automatically opened and returned to their previous state.

“Ah Sheng, did you encounter such a situation when you came before?” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss and asked An Sheng.

“Never. Young Master Wen, do you think the fire phoenix from before has something to do with this hourglass?” As An Sheng spoke, he looked at the backpack that had been burned to a crisp. The things in the backpack had already been dropped across the ground. Many things had been destroyed, but the crystal hourglass remained intact. It lay horizontally on the ground, the sand still flowing.

“I also think it might be related. Nothing happened last time you came here, and nothing happened when we were walking. However, after the hourglass reversed, an incident occurred. Apart from it, I really can’t think of any other reason,” Zhou Wen said.

“Let’s use our Companion Beasts to scout ahead and see if the other stone houses have the same problem.” As An Sheng spoke, he summoned a lion and let it enter the next room An Sheng planned on entering.

The moment the lion entered, the stone house suddenly sealed shut. Soon, An Sheng’s expression changed.

Zhou Wen used Truth Listener’s powers to figure out what was happening next door, but he couldn’t hear anything. There seemed to be a force blocking Truth Listener from hearing past the stone house’s wall.

Soon, the tunnel door opened and the lion Companion Beast that had entered vanished. From the looks of it, it had been killed.

“These stone houses have indeed become a little strange. After my Companion Beast entered, it quickly had its connection with me severed. I couldn’t sense what happened inside either,” An Sheng said with a heavy expression.

Zhou Wen looked in from the door, but he didn’t discover any murals in the stone house. It was no different from an ordinary stone house.

“If the changes in the maze are related to this crystal hourglass, do you think the maze will return to normal when we wait for the crystal hourglass’s sand to reverse?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the hourglass in his hand.

“That’s very likely.” An Sheng stared at the sand in the hourglass and said, “From the speed at which the sand flows, it should reverse every hour. Let’s wait here for an hour.”

“Alright.” Zhou Wen also felt that it was better to wait.

God knew what other strange things were in this maze. Although he had Mythical pets, his body was still at the Epic stage. If anything happened in such a small stone house, he might not be able to dodge it. It was useless no matter how strong his Companion Beasts were.

The two of them waited in the stone house as time ticked by. When the sand from the hourglass completely flowed out, they heard a chime that was identical to the sound they had heard previously. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In the next second, the sand in the hourglass began to flow in reverse.

“I’ll give it another try.” An Sheng summoned another Companion Beast and let it enter the room the lion had entered.

Indeed, the stone house’s passageway didn’t close this time. The Companion Beasts inside didn’t show any signs of trouble.

“We were right.” An Sheng carefully entered the room, but there weren’t any incidents.

Therefore, Zhou Wen and An Sheng used their Companion Beasts as scouts and continued proceeding towards the next treasure chest in the maze. They passed many stone houses, but nothing happened.

When the hourglass reversed, the two of them stopped and didn’t continue advancing. They stayed in place for an hour, waiting for the hourglass to reverse again before continuing.

It was unknown what kind of relationship the hourglass had with the maze. It could actually control it. The situation inside the maze was completely different when the sand flowed in the different directions.

When he was forced to rest, Zhou Wen studied the hourglass. He wanted to see if he could control the flow of sand in the hourglass.

If he could control it, wouldn’t he be able to control this maze?

However, after studying it for quite some time, Zhou Wen didn’t discover how to control the hourglass. The main reason he didn’t dare act rashly was that he was afraid that he would damage the hourglass. That would only make things worse.

I’ll think of a way to study it after we leave. Zhou Wen temporarily gave up the idea of controlling it.

“Young Master Wen, I seem to have discovered something,” An Sheng said.

“What did you discover? Is it a secret regarding the maze?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

“No.” An Sheng shook his head and said, “After so many experiences with you, I realized that as long as you enter a dimensional zone, it’s easy for unexpected things to happen...”

“Coincidence... It must be a coincidence...” Zhou Wen said firmly. Although he also felt that something would happen every time he entered a dimensional zone, he definitely wouldn’t admit that he was a jinx.

Even if there’s a problem, it’s definitely because of the Tiger Soul General, Bamboo Blade, and Tai Sui. It’s definitely not my problem, Zhou Wen thought.

An Sheng laughed and said, “Actually, this isn’t bad either. At the very least, it won’t be that boring. It’s always so thrilling every time I enter a dimensional zone with you.”

“It really has nothing to do with me,” Zhou Wen said with a sullen expression.

The two of them kept walking and stopping. After traveling for more than thirty hours, they finally arrived at the room where the second treasure chest was.

“Young Master Wen, open it and take a look,” An Sheng said with a heavy expression.

“Do I really have to open it?” Zhou Wen asked, somewhat worried.

The crystal hourglass appeared in the first treasure chest. Who knew what was inside this chest.

It would be fine if a Companion Egg or dimensional crystal dropped, but if a bomb appeared and blasted them to death, it would be terrible.

Although it was just an analogy, Zhou Wen couldn’t rule out the possibility of a bomb inside.

“Open it. Even if there’s a Buddha Annihilation inside, we can just fight it again. There’s nothing to be afraid of,” An Sheng said with a smile.

Zhou Wen swallowed his saliva and reached out to lift the lid of the treasure chest. His heart was beating rapidly like a drum.

An Sheng and Zhou Wen looked into the treasure chest and were taken aback.

There was actually another chest in the treasure chest. The material and style were the same as the treasure chest, but it was a little smaller.

Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he opened the lid. He saw that there was an even smaller treasure chest inside. After opening seven or eight treasure chests, all he saw were even smaller ones.
