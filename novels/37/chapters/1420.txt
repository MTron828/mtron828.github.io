Chapter 1421: Human Sovereign Attempts the Level

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen chatted with Tsukuyomi for a while and gained a deeper understanding of the dangers of the universe.

Apart from being food for other Calamity creatures, there was the constant danger of Essence Energy expenditure. One needed to constantly replenish their Essence Energy to maintain their combat strength.

If one expended too much energy, it wouldn’t only be a problem of a decline in combat strength. One might even starve to death.

Apart from hunting other Calamity creatures, one could also obtain Essence Energy from dimensional zones on different planets. There was also an important source of Essence Energy—Companion Beasts born on those planets.

Only then did Zhou Wen understand that Calamity creatures like Tsukuyomi and The Fallen wanted the Venusian Companion Beast to increase their strength, but also use it as food.

An existence like the Dragon Turtle had risked entry into the dimensional zone because it was starving—typical Essence Energy couldn’t satisfy its survival requirements.

“Are you hungry?” Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi with an odd expression.

Tsukuyomi stared at Zhou Wen and suddenly licked her lips. This action gave Zhou Wen a fright as he nearly jumped out of bed.

“Don’t be afraid. I still don’t plan on eating you. You’re too thin. I should be fattening you up before I eat you.” Tsukuyomi burst out laughing.

Zhou Wen smiled awkwardly. He also knew that if Tsukuyomi wanted to eat him, she would have done so long ago. There was no need to wait until now to tell him this.

“If you have the need, I can provide you with some Essence Energy Crystals,” Zhou Wen said.

Tsukuyomi looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Typical Essence Energy Crystals aren’t of much use to Calamity-grade creatures. It doesn’t matter if we eat them or not. I need Calamity-grade Essence Energy Crystals. Do you have them?”

“No.” Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as he looked at Tsukuyomi and said, “You entered the Venusian dimensional zone for the second time and tried your best to obtain a ranking because you wanted to obtain the Venusian Companion Beast as food, right? In that case, you should have reached the point of needing to replenish your Essence Energy, yes?”

“I do need to replenish my Essence Energy, but it looks like it won’t work this time. That Xiao’s strength should be at the Human Realm, but his attributes are very strange. I’m afraid it’s difficult to surpass him,” Tsukuyomi said.

“Apart from the Venusian Companion Beast, is there no other place to replenish Essence Energy?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“You can hunt other dimensional creatures or Companion Beasts. Not all creatures are that strong. There are still some weaker fellows. There are still opportunities,” Tsukuyomi said indifferently.

“Can you go to the Moon? If there’s anything you need my help with, go to the Moon to find Lady Supreme Yin,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“There shouldn’t be such a need,” Tsukuyomi said indifferently.

“Go if there’s ever such a need.” Zhou Wen got up and said, “I should return. Let’s chat another time if fate allows it.”

After Zhou Wen used spatial teleportation to leave, Tsukuyomi licked her lips again and rubbed her stomach with her palm. She muttered to herself,?I’m really hungry. I wonder how long I can last.

…

After Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang, he planned how to kill the Calamity gunner and clinch first place on the Cube.

Ever since he spoke to Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen realized that a Calamity-grade Companion Beast was good stuff. It could be used for fighting usually and be eaten when one was hungry. It was a necessary divine artifact for traveling.

After he advanced to the Calamity grade, he would definitely need to use them.

There were many resources in the universe that required the strength of a Calamity-grade to vie for them. Otherwise, entering the universe was equivalent to courting death.

Zhou Wen originally wanted the Venusian Companion Egg, but now, he was even more eager to obtain it.

I wonder if Ghost God Eyes can really find the location of the Calamity gunner. If Soul Mirror isn’t done before the countdown ends, I can only give it a try using Ghost God Eyes.?Zhou Wen looked at the time. There were still more than fifty hours left on the countdown. He could still afford to wait.

The colorful light from the Soul Mirror weakened, but it didn’t seem like it would completely converge anytime soon.

Time ticked by. No other creature reached six stars. In fact, no other creature challenged the rankings.

When there was only an hour left before the countdown ended and the Soul Mirror still hadn’t completed its evolution, Zhou Wen decided not to wait any longer.

Firstly, he couldn’t wait any longer. Secondly, even if the Soul Mirror advanced to the Calamity grade, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if it was effective against the Calamity gunner.

After making sufficient preparations, Zhou Wen donned the Prisoned Dragon armor and held the Immortal Culling Sword. In the disguise of Human Sovereign, he arrived at the Venusian dimensional zone again.

Seeing that the countdown was about to end, everyone stared at it.

Now, most people felt that there was no suspense and Xiao would retain first place. After all, it was very difficult to obtain six stars.

“Professor Gu, there’s less than an hour left on the countdown. Do you think there will be any surprises or suspense we should expect regarding the Cube’s rankings?” the host asked Professor Gu in the live broadcast.

“There shouldn’t be any surprises…” Before Professor Gu could finish his sentence, he suddenly saw the Cube screen light up. A figure stood in the Venusian dimensional zone.

“It’s Human Sovereign! He finally appeared!”

“There’s something wrong with Professor Gu’s mouth, right?”

“Holy sh*t, he’s finally here. I thought he didn’t plan on appearing.”

“So what if he’s here? Although Human Sovereign is a little strong, I’m afraid he can’t reach Xiao’s level.”

“What are you talking about? Our Human Sovereign is invincible. Xiao and whatever six-stars are all trash in front of our Human Sovereign.”

“Human Sovereign will definitely win!”

Most humans supported Human Sovereign. Although humans were motivated by self-interest, humans were also sentimental creatures.

Emotionally, most humans still hoped that Human Sovereign would obtain first place, not Saint Xiao, who represented the Holy Land.

“Bro, do you think Human Sovereign has a chance of reaching first place?” Zhang Yuzhi looked at Zhang Chunqiu.

“It’s difficult. Even if he’s Human Sovereign, that Xiao’s strength is too powerful and strange. I’m afraid it’s very difficult to surpass him. Zhang Chunqiu knew very well that although Human Sovereign was very strong, he relied on his sword—his body wasn’t at the Calamity grade. It was impossible for him to reach Xiao’s level.

“Sigh, I know it’s very difficult, but I really don’t want the Holy Land to get first,” Zhang Yuzhi said.

“No one wishes so, but that’s reality. It won’t change because of our personal feelings.” Zhang Chunqiu stared at Human Sovereign on the screen and said, “But that person… Perhaps a miracle will really happen… After all, he’s Human Sovereign…”

Jiang Yan led the core members of the League of Guardians to gather in front of the Cube. Zhong Ziya sat on the sofa, drinking and listening to the radio.

Hui Haifeng was in the meeting hall of an office building, watching the livestream with a group of federal officials. His expression was rather solemn.

“This should be the last hope for pure humans, right?” Xia Xuanyue from the Xia family sighed.

“We still don’t know if he’s pure human.” Although Xia Liuchuan said that, he hoped that Human Sovereign could amount to something.. At the very least, he wanted to take the wind out of the fellows from the Holy Land.
