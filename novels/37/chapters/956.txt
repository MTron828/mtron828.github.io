Chapter 957: Feng and Qin

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen activated his Glimmer Life Soul the entire journey. When he arrived near Sea Return, the Glimmer Life Soul had improved significantly, but it was still lacking a little when it came to advancing to the Perfect Body.

Every time he rested, Zhou Wen would switch to cultivating the Qi Refinement Art. He would absorb Essence Crystals in-game to raise Sword Pill’s Essence Energy.

As many of the Essence Energy Crystals Zhou Wen absorbed in-game were at the Mythical stage, Sword Pill’s Essence Energy increased rapidly. He could sense that Sword Pill’s Essence Energy had reached a certain limit and was about to advance again.

However, Zhou Wen still didn’t understand how Sword Pill could advance to a Perfect Body.

The last time he advanced to an Evolved Body, Zhou Wen had cultivated 3,000 sword intents, but it didn’t seem to be effective this time. From the looks of it, the key to advancing to a Perfect Body wasn’t the sword intents. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Since it’s called Sword Pill, it probably has something to do with swords. Could it be that I should transform Sword Pill into a sword? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

Zhou Wen had already considered this problem previously. He didn’t have a sword he especially liked. If he needed to turn Sword Pill into a sword, Zhou Wen planned on using Light Concealment Sword as its prototype.

However, Sword Pill failed to be molded, nor did it advance to a Perfect Body.

If it can’t be transformed into a sword, how can I advance Sword Pill? Zhou Wen considered all sorts of possibilities and tried many methods, but he still failed.

When they finally arrived at Sea Return, Feng Qiuyan invited Zhou Wen and Li Xuan to stay at his place.

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan didn’t stand on ceremony as they followed Feng Qiuyan to the Feng family residence. In fact, there weren’t many places in Sea Return City that they could stay. If they didn’t go there, their only choice was Sea Return City’s only hotel.

There were two famous Feng family branches. One was in the Imperial Capital, and the other was the Feng family of Sea Return.

As Sea Return was close to the sea, the break-out creatures in the nearby sea often appeared ashore, making the vicinity of Sea Return City very desolate. There were very few pedestrians on the streets.

When the Feng family saw Feng Qiuyan return, they were overjoyed. It looked like Feng Qiuyan was very favored by the Feng family.

Upon hearing that Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were Feng Qiuyan’s schoolmates, the Feng family was especially warm to them.

“Little Yanyan, you have quite a high status in your family. You actually have special guest rooms,” Li Xuan said as he sized up the room.

Feng Qiuyan said, “As the eldest son and grandson of the family, I have some privileges, but I’ll be responsible for the Feng family in the future.”

“Qiuyan, you’re back.” Just as the three of them were chatting, a beautiful and dignified woman walked over.

“Sis Ling, I’ve just returned. I originally planned on visiting you after settling my classmates down.” Feng Qiuyan chatted with the woman.

“Little Yanyan, why didn’t you introduce such a beauty to us? Is this your sister? She’s really beautiful,” Li Xuan praised the woman.

Li Xuan didn’t mean to curry favor, but this woman was indeed very beautiful. Even Zhou Wen took a second look.

“This is Qin Ling, Sis Ling. These are my schoolmates, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan. They helped me a lot in school,” Feng Qiuyan introduced the three of them.

Qin Ling was a very polite woman, but at the same time, she kept an arms-length distance from people despite looking very gentle. People couldn’t build a closer relationship with her.

After Qin Ling left, Li Xuan asked Feng Qiuyan, “Little Yanyan, she isn’t a blood sister, right?”

“How did you know?” Feng Qiuyan was somewhat surprised.

“Apart from practicing martial arts, you are really an idiot in other aspects. Her surname is Qin and yours is Feng. How can she be your blood sister?” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.

Feng Qiuyan explained, “Then you’re wrong. Our Feng family has a tradition. The boys have the surname Feng, but girls have the surname Qin.”

“Why the strange rules? Could it be that your mother’s surname is Qin? That’s not right either. It’s impossible for all the women who marry into your Feng family to have the Qin surname,” Li Xuan said in puzzlement.

Feng Qiuyan said, “Actually, I’m not too sure about the reason. I heard from my elders that it seems that a person with the Qin surname had done our Feng family a great favor, so to thank him, all the girls in the Feng family have the Qin surname. This tradition existed many years before the dimensional storms and it has been continued to this day.”

After a pause, Feng Qiuyan said in embarrassment, “However, Qin Ling isn’t my sister. She doesn’t have any blood ties with our Feng family.”

“Then what’s her relationship with you? There’s something amiss between the two of you,” Li Xuan asked nosily.

Feng Qiuyan blushed. “Actually, Sis Ling is my fiancée.”

“Holy sh*t, you’re only seventeen, right? How do you have a fiancée? And she’s so beautiful! She looks much older than you. She should be in her twenties, right?” Li Xuan widened his eyes.

Feng Qiuyan explained, “Sea Return is actually more traditional. My father and Sis Ling’s parents are good friends. This marriage was arranged by our family.”

“What era is this? To think there are still arranged marriages... Why didn’t I encounter such a great deal? Why don’t I have such a beautiful fiancée? Heaven is unfair!” Li Xuan sighed at his fate.

However, Feng Qiuyan’s expression darkened. “It’s not what you think. The reason we are engaged is related to our Life Providences. It’s not an arranged marriage.”

“Life Providence? I remember that your Life Providence is Swift Saber Heavenly King. Could it be that her Life Providence is Swift Saber Heavenly Queen, making her a match for you? Then you are so lucky,” Li Xuan said.

“Stop talking. Let Qiuyan finish.” Zhou Wen could tell that there was something amiss with Feng Qiuyan’s emotions.

Feng Qiuyan said, “Her Life Providence is Scabbard, and her Life Soul is the Saber Sacrificer. However, any saber that lands in her hand will become stronger. The reason my father made her my fiancée was because he fancied her Life Providence and Life Soul, believing they would be of help to me.”

“Although that’s the case, Qin Ling is so beautiful. Even if she’s a little older, you can still count yourself lucky,” Li Xuan consoled.

“Sis Ling is indeed very nice,” Feng Qiuyan said with a sigh.

Li Xuan was good with reading people as he added, “But you don’t like her, right?”

“It’s not that I don’t like her. I should say that I’ve never thought about these things. All I want now is to become stronger,” Feng Qiuyan said.

“That’s an excuse. If you really liked her, you wouldn’t have such thoughts. She just hasn’t caught your eye,” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.

Feng Qiuyan looked out the door and seeing that no one was there, he lowered his voice and said to Zhou Wen and Li Xuan, “I’ll tell you something, but you mustn’t tell anyone else.”

“Don’t worry. Don’t you trust our character? We definitely won’t tell anyone. Quick, tell me what’s going on. Could it be that Qin Ling has a boyfriend outside? It’s no wonder considering how she made you a cuckold. She’s already in her twenties, so it’s not too much to have already had a boyfriend,” Li Xuan said excitedly.

“What are you talking about? Sis Ling isn’t that kind of person.” Feng Qiuyan hesitated for a moment before saying, “I think Sis Ling isn’t human.”

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were taken aback as they looked at Feng Qiuyan in a daze, unsure what he meant.
