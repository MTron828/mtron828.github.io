Chapter 1585: Tiger Soul General Appropriated

Translator: CKtalon

When Godsfall saw Tiger Soul General fly towards him, he revealed a gratified smile and thought to himself, Although the process was a little tricky, I still completed the mission.

After Tiger Soul General landed on Godsfall, Godsfall looked down at Zhou Wen and said indifferently, “You should be proud to be able to force me to use the Holy Artifact.”

However, when Godsfall sensed the information from Tiger Soul General, he was stunned. He almost couldn’t believe the information he had received.

“Impossible. How can it only be at the Human Realm?” At that instant, Godsfall thought that he had snatched a fake Tiger Soul General.

From Tiger Soul General’s performance on Dubhe, he was undoubtedly at the Hell level. Furthermore, he had to be a top existence at the Hell level. Only then could he possess such might and easily kill two Starlord Ravenous Wolves.

Therefore, Godsfall found it unbelievable that Tiger Soul General was only at the Human Realm.

However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s name wasn’t wrong and its appearance was right. It couldn’t be fake. After all, Calamity-grade Companion Beasts were relatively rare. Zhou Wen couldn’t have two identical Calamity-grade Companion Beasts, right? The chances were too low.

Could it be that Tiger Soul General is really that strong? He can kill Hell-level creatures at the Human Realm? Godsfall had his suspicions.

Apart from the difference in physical attributes, there was also the evolutionary difference of the Calamity Zone. A Hell-level domain would undergo a qualitative change.

For example, the two domains of fire and water that were both at the Human Realm might be able to mutually restrain each other, but if one domain advanced to the Hell level, it would completely crush the other.

Godsfall only noticed Tiger Soul General’s level and ability, but he didn’t have the time to carefully study his skills. Therefore, he didn’t realize how terrifying the Jinxes Master skill was.

“Zhou Wen, is this the Tiger Soul General you used to kill the Starlord Ravenous Wolves?” Godsfall summoned Tiger Soul General and asked Zhou Wen.

Although he felt that the possibility of Zhou Wen possessing two Tiger Soul Generals wasn’t high, Godsfall still wanted to get to the bottom of it.

“It’s whatever you make it to be.” Zhou Wen looked at Godsfall with a look of pity.

It was fine if he possessed Tiger Soul General, but to actually summon it—even Liu Yun hadn’t been as arrogant as him.

It’s coming... It’s coming... Zhou Wen was somewhat excited.

In fact, he didn’t know what the snowflake-like points of light were. However, he had a nagging feeling that the sudden appearance of these snowflakes was related to Tiger Soul General.

The points of light constantly condensed in the sky as they snowballed. Although no one knew what it was, the terrifying energy fluctuations in the snowball left everyone alarmed.

“Stop gaslighting!” Godsfall held the Connate Insight in his hand and transformed into a Connate Divine Light that struck the huge snowball in the sky.

‘The Connate Divine Light was indomitable and could destroy virtually anything in the world. However, when it struck the snowball, it was like water being soaked up by a sponge as it seeped into the snowball.

The snowball that was originally emitting light became even brighter. As for the snowflakes that flew out of everything, they flew towards the snowball at an even faster speed and fused with it.

The points of light that seemed to be snow appeared to have accelerators activated as they charged towards the huge snowball in the sky.

Godsfall was first taken aback before he realized the problem.

These snowflake-like points of light weren’t caused by anyone. They seemed to have appeared because of his Connate power and the Connate Insight.

Zhou Wen naturally saw this scene. His thoughts were the same as Godsfall. The points of light were definitely affected by the Holy Artifact.

However, he went one level deeper than Godsfall. He felt that this coincidence might not be a pure coincidence. Perhaps it was thanks to Tiger Soul General.

Zhou Wen carefully sensed the energy fluctuations of the points of light, hoping to know what kind of power it was. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

However, the energy fluctuations of the points of light were very special. He could only sense the existence of energy, but he couldn’t tell what attributes it had.

Zhou Wen extended his finger and touched a point of light with his fingertip. Immediately, he felt a strange force enter his body from his fingertip.

This power... Zhou Wen widened his eyes in disbelief.
