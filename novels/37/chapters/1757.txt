Chapter 1758 Trajectory Seeking Kowtows for Tutelage

Although it was only a small step, the girl’s beliefs were already shaken.

What was even more fatal was that after taking this small step back, the girl realized that the tip of Zhou Wen’s sword couldn’t touch her body. If she didn’t move, the tip of the sword would only slice past her.

This discovery further shattered the girl’s psychological defense. It instantly made her expression turn embarrassed and angry. It was anger and embarrassment after being fooled.

Just as she had expected, Zhou Wen’s strike slashed across her in a teasing manner. The further away the tip of the sword was from her, the uglier the girl’s expression.

Many of the new city guards watching the battle began booing.

The girl had slashed so many times beside Zhou Wen, but he stood there motionless. Many times, the blade had almost brushed past his cheek.

Now, Zhou Wen had only slashed once and it was such a distance from the girl; yet, she had retreated. Clearly, she wasn’t confident enough.

“How’s my strike? Is it worthy of being able to teach such a student?” Zhou Wen sheathed the sword and said calmly to the girl.

The girl looked at Zhou Wen as her lips moved, but she couldn’t say a word. She could naturally tell that Zhou Wen’s realm and standards were far above Qin Zhen’s. Even she couldn’t figure out his trajectory. Such standards were probably something only the big shots of the various races could do in the dimension.

For a human to actually cultivate his sword arts to such a level, it could be said that he was infinitely close to the realm of the Apocalypse-grade big shots. He could probably even match the Apocalypse-grade realm. The girl couldn’t imagine how Zhou Wen had done it.

The girl knew very well that it was impossible for humans to produce an Apocalypse-grade. Finding someone close to one was impossible as well; yet, Zhou Wen’s sword art realm clearly exceeded his level.

In fact, the girl had overestimated Zhou Wen’s realm. Zhou Wen’s Immortal Slaying was indeed very strong and his realm was indeed very high.

When teaching Qin Zhen, the feedback from the Teacher Domain also deepened Zhou Wen’s understanding of Immortal Slaying. The teaching process was also a process of self-growth, allowing him to reach the present realm of Immortal Slaying.

Now, the Immortal Slaying realm was indeed close to the realm of many Apocalypse-grade big shots, but it was still quite a distance away. The reason the girl had such a feeling was thanks to the Teacher Domain.

When the girl demonstrated her sword art, the Teacher Domain had already produced some level of analysis. It was through such an analysis that Zhou Wen had a certain understanding of her Trajectory powers. Only by targeting her with the sword could he achieve a better effect.

The Heaven-level Teacher Domain was undoubtedly a divine skill.

The girl looked at Zhou Wen without the contempt from before.

The girl was already an existence infinitely close to the Apocalypse grade. She was also the existence closest to advancing to the Apocalypse grade in the Trajectory Holy Temple in the past few millennia. From her point of view, Zhou Wen was already qualified to be mentioned in the same breath as herat least in terms of sword arts realm.

“Lady, what are you waiting for? Quickly come and acknowledge him as your master. It’s your good fortune to be my brother’s disciple,” Li Xuan mocked.

“That’s right, young lady. Quickly acknowledge him as your master. It’s your good fortune to be under City Lord Zhou’s tutelage. If you miss this opportunity, there won’t be another one.”

“Indeed. To be able to become City Lord Zhou’s disciple is something many people can’t even beg for. You have profited from a disaster.”

Everyone jeered, causing the girl’s face to turn livid and pale. She looked like she would explode at any moment.

At that moment, Xiao stood forward and coughed lightly. “City Lord Zhou’s sword art is indeed unprecedented in the human world. This lady’s sword art isn’t inferior either. Why don’t we call this a draw?”

Xiao knew very well that if the girl really went berserk, even if Zhou Wen and company could remain safe and sound, Guide City would probably be reduced to a river of blood.

Just as Xiao said that, the girl suddenly looked up and stared at Zhou Wen with a sharp gaze. She enunciated each word clearly and said, “Will you dare have me acknowledge you as my master?”

Zhou Wen originally didn’t take this to heart. Since he knew that the girl wasn’t human but an alien from the Trajectory Holy Temple, he wasn’t in the mood of taking in an alien student, much less teach her anything to prevent her from becoming a calamity for humanity in the future.

As Xiao spoke, Zhou Wen planned on letting it go, but with the girl provoking him, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to let her off.

“Why wouldn’t I dare?” Zhou Wen asked indifferently.

“Alright, I’ll acknowledge you as my master. I hope you won’t regret it in the future.” With that said, the girl really took a step forward and knelt in front of Zhou Wen. She said loudly, “Master, please receive three kowtows from your student, Trajectory Seeking.”

Xiao’s expression changed drastically, but it was too late to stop her.

Without a word, the girl knelt down. The moment her forehead touched the ground, the sky suddenly changed color. The originally bright sky instantly turned strange.

The sky seemed to turn into a kaleidoscope as it was split into pieces. The original clouds and sun seemed to become countless after being refracted by the kaleidoscope.

The sky was strange, beautiful, and resplendent. Instantly, everyone was dumbfounded.

Looking up at the strange sky, Xiao’s expression turned abnormally odd.

Zhou Wen was also looking at the strange scene in the sky. The Teacher Domain wasn’t big enough to envelop the entire sky, so he naturally didn’t know what the strange scene was about.

Zhou Wen vaguely felt a strange energy fluctuation from the girl.

However, the power was extremely strange. It wasn’t metal, wood, water, fire, or earth, nor was it space, time, or matter. Instead, it was somewhat similar to the power on Wang Lu’s body, but it was also somewhat different.

“Do you dare let me continue?” The girl knelt in front of Zhou Wen with a teasing look in her eyes.

“Why aren’t you continuing? Aren’t you going to kowtow three times?” Zhou Wen said calmly.

“Master, please accept your student, Trajectory Seeking’s second bow.” The girl was straightforward as she bowed again.

With this bow, the originally kaleidoscope-like sky shattered like glass. After the kaleidoscope-like luster, it turned into an extremely dark abyss, going from a sharp contrast of extreme brightness to extreme darkness. The entire Guide City instantly fell into absolute darkness.

It was pitch-black, and it was difficult to make out anything that was inches away. The residents of Guide City fell into a panic. In fact, it wasn’t just Guide City. The entire world was in a panic, unsure what had happened.

“Master, please accept your disciple, Trajectory Seeking’s third kowtow.” Only the girl’s voice echoed in the darkness. Her figure couldn’t be seen, but one could hear her forehead touching the ground.

After this shout, a white light instantly descended from the extremely black sky. The white light was unimaginably fast as though it was originally there. From the moment it was discovered to the moment it landed on Zhou Wen, there seemed to be a period of time and space missing. It was impossible to dodge.
