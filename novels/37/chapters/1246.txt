Chapter 1247: Blocking Bullets

Everyone’s eyes were trained on Tsukuyomi. Basically, no one could see the trajectory of the bullet. They could only see the outcome.

Tsukuyomi was still standing there as before. Her figure hadn’t moved at all, but her left hand was raised. Her slender middle finger and index finger held a long, sharp bullet. The sides of the bullet were dented by her fingers.

Clang! Tsukuyomi released her finger and allowed the bullet to fall to the ground. Her gaze remained calm as she looked at the door that the bullet came from.

“She actually caught it!” Everyone was alarmed. After watching the battles for so long, this was the first time they had seen what the bullet looked like.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Although the bullet had already been deformed, one could still roughly tell that it was a bullet made of black metal and there were some strange patterns on its surface.

However, the patterns couldn’t be identified due to the bullet’s deformity.

Bang! Bang!

Gunshots sounded one after another. As Tsukuyomi walked towards the door, she gently waved her jade-like palm and bullets were caught between her fingers. In an instant, the first six shots had been fired, but the seventh shot didn’t immediately sound.

Tsukuyomi had already walked to the door and extended her palm. Five bullets fell to the ground like the previous bullets.

“Too powerful… Professor Gu is right. This fairy is much stronger than Dragon Turtle…”

“Such a beautiful creature and at the Calamity grade. Do you think a Companion Egg will appear if she’s killed?”

“If a Companion Egg appears, I’ll be the first to snatch it.”

“What right do you have to snatch it? If anyone wants to snatch it, it can only be Thief Sage and Looter King.”

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to read the comments, nor did he want to hear Professor Gu and the host’s analysis. All his attention was on Tsukuyomi. He was somewhat nervous, unsure if Tsukuyomi could withstand the fatal seventh strike.

No creature had been able to survive the seventh shot to date. Be it Grim Reaper No. 10—who possessed an undying body and immortality, or the Calamity-grade Dragon Turtle, all of them died when hit.

Tsukuyomi walked to the door and was about to enter when the seventh shot rang.

Upon hearing the gunshot, everyone shuddered before looking at Tsukuyomi.

Some people didn’t even dare to look at Tsukuyomi, afraid that they would see her head explode.

Zhou Wen kept staring at her. After the gunshot, he couldn’t help but be alarmed when he saw her situation.

Tsukuyomi’s fingers had already clamped onto the seventh bullet, but the bullet didn’t lose its strength because of Tsukuyomi’s clamp.

The bullet spun violently between Tsukuyomi’s fingers and rubbed against Tsukuyomi’s Moonlight Force. The head of the bullet lit up due to the excessive heat. From afar, it looked like Tsukuyomi’s fingers were clamping a constantly changing light shuttle.

Her Moonlight Force constantly collided with the bullet, and Tsukuyomi couldn’t completely control the bullet, nor could the bullet continue its trajectory.

Clang!

Tsukuyomi raised her fingers slightly and forcefully changed the trajectory of the bullet, allowing it to fly past her.

As it was too fast, most people couldn’t see clearly after the bullet left Tsukuyomi’s finger. They thought that Tsukuyomi had successfully blocked the fatal seventh shot.

However, Zhou Wen saw that after the bullet flew over, it circled in the air like a living creature and shot at the back of Tsukuyomi’s head at an even faster speed.

Bang!

Almost at the same time, the eighth shot sounded. Not only did this shot have powerful offensive power, but it also concealed the seventh bullet that had circled back, throwing Tsukuyomi into a pincer attack situation.

Almost at the moment Zhou Wen discovered the turning bullet, he had already used spatial teleportation to arrive on Venus.

Bang! Clang!

After two gunshots, the spectators realized that Tsukuyomi’s fingers had clamped the eighth bullet. And behind Tsukuyomi, an ancient sword blocked the seventh bullet that circled back.

Strangely, when the bullet that could blast apart everything struck the ancient sword’s scabbard, it failed to shatter it. It only sent the ancient sword flying, and the bullet changed its trajectory.

The ancient sword flew out and landed in someone’s hand. When everyone took a closer look, they realized that the person holding the ancient sword was none other than Looter King.

“Holy sh*t, what’s that ancient sword in Looter King’s hand? It can actually block a Calamity-grade bullet?”

“That’s not an ordinary bullet, but the sure-kill seventh bullet.”

“Could that be a Calamity-grade sword?”

“That’s impossible, right?”

“Holy sh*t, what background does Looter King have? He can withstand a Calamity-grade bullet, so why is he looting the spoils of others? Wouldn’t it be fine for him to clear the dimensional zone himself?”

Everyone looked at Zhou Wen in surprise. Zhou Wen was also somewhat surprised.

He knew that he couldn’t block the bullet, and had originally planned on using a harder piece of equipment to block it for Tsukuyomi.

The so-called blocking was only to stall for time. He didn’t expect the sword to really block the bullet. All he needed to do was give Tsukuyomi a little extra time.

However, to his surprise, the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords, which Zhou Wen had treated as a sacrifice, surprisingly didn’t shatter. It managed to take on the brunt of the seventh bullet.

Is the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords that hard? Zhou Wen was alarmed and delighted.

Ever since he fused the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords, Zhou Wen hadn’t been able to pull it out. He didn’t know how to use it, so he hadn’t used it. Now, using it as cannon fodder had a miraculous effect.

Tsukuyomi glanced at Zhou Wen and nodded at him with a smile.

Zhou Wen knew that Tsukuyomi had likely recognized him, but in the next second, Tsukuyomi turned around and rushed through the door. She was too fast. Zhou Wen wanted to follow her, but there were already several gunshots inside before it suddenly fell silent.

Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat. There was dead silence behind the door. Zhou Wen knew that it was probably too late for him to rush in, but he still wanted to take a look and use teleportation to rush in.

However, there were tunnels that extended in all directions. The six doors were connected. Zhou Wen had also rushed in previously in-game.

However, he was killed not long after charging in. He failed to find the dimensional creature that shot the bullets.

This time, Zhou Wen stuck a Substitute Talisman on himself. If he was shot, he would immediately escape.

However, after he rushed into the tunnel and searched for a while, no one attacked him.

When Zhou Wen passed through the criss-crossing corridors and arrived in front of a metal palace, he realized that Tsukuyomi was standing there. She didn’t look injured, but Zhou Wen didn’t see the corpse of the dimensional creature.

Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, the metal palace’s door opened with a bang, emitting a resplendent glow.

The people on Earth also saw this scene through the Cube. They were as puzzled as Zhou Wen, unsure what had happened.

Zhou Wen retreated into the tunnel, afraid to be illuminated by the light from the palace. As for Tsukuyomi, she stood there without any intention of dodging.
