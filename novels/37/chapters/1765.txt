Chapter 1766 New World

Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else as he walked towards the Cube.

It’s been a while since I’ve tried entering the Cube. Zhou Wen stood on the Cube and felt ambivalent. If he had a choice, he would rather game than take the risk himself.

However, the dimensional zone this time had a different meaning. If he could download it, it would be a great boon to his future understanding of the dimension.

As the Cube lit up, Zhou Wen’s figure vanished.

“It’s Zhou Wen!” The host, Su Yi, immediately shouted when she saw Zhou Wen’s figure appear in the Lake of Fog. Her shouting ‘Zhou Wen’ seemed to have immense magical power as it attracted everyone’s attention.

Due to Ming Xiu and company, everyone in the Federation wanted to know what Zhou Wen looked like and what kind of person he was. They were just too curious.

Their first impression didn’t take their breath away; many people were somewhat disappointed.

Zhou Wen looked withdrawn and handsomehe didn’t have the wildness and charm like Zhong Ziya, nor was he as noble as Liu Yun who looked like the son of god. He didn’t even have the youthfulness of Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan.

The feeling Zhou Wen gave off was that he was a rather handsome ordinary person. If one had to say something good about him, it was that his figure wasn’t bad. His slender and muscular figure was streamlined without any especially exaggerated muscles.

“Preposterous!” An Tianzuo slammed the table with a nasty expression.

It was fine if Ming Xiu and company had attempted the level previously, but there were still golden fruits back then, so there wasn’t much risk. However, now that the golden fruits had been plucked, no one knew what would happen if they entered. Exiting became a question.

“He’s letting it get to his head after some tiny achievements. How can he do anything big in the future?” An Tianzuo was infuriated, and his tone was naturally nasty. “Overseer, don’t worry too much. With Feng Qiuyan and company, as well as his two brothers scouting ahead, Young Master Wen should have some confidence. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have gone in,” An Sheng consoled.

“Who’s his brother? Are those fools worthy of being his brother?” An Tianzuo was even more infuriated. “Is what those idiots did called scouting? That’s more like creating a dead end. Only that punk has these riffraff that deserve being executed.”

An Sheng didn’t dare continue the conversation. He muttered softly under his breath-in a voice that could only be heard by himself, “Right, and only you are worthy.”

“What did you say?” An Tianzuo glared at him.

“I said that Young Master Wen only has one brother. Those two fellows went overboard by shamelessly impersonating as one,” An Sheng hurriedly said, afire with noble indignation.

“Who’s his brother? Do you think I, An Tianzuo, have such an idiot younger brother?” An Tianzuo snorted coldly and continued, “Bring me the recently researched combat suit.”

“Overseer, what are you trying to do?” An Sheng was immediately alarmed.

“Nothing. Can’t I take it out to take a look?” An Tianzuo said coldly, “Ah Sheng, you’ve been talking more and more recently. Do my orders have to get your approval?”

“Overseer, how would I dare? I’ll get it now.” An Sheng hurriedly saluted and left, but he prayed inwardly. Please let nothing happen to Young Master Wen. Otherwise, this would be a bad joke. A life might even be lost.

Zhou Wen floated above the lake and felt his body being suppressed by a strange force. This feeling wasn’t unfamiliar. He had been to the dimension when he was weak. The dimension was filled with such power. Creatures below the Mythical stage had no space to survive in the dimension. It was impossible to even see what the world looked like.

Humans on Earth could see the appearance of the Lake of Oblivion because the Cube’s broadcast had screened the power’s interference. People inside didn’t share such benefits.

However, with Zhou Wen’s present standard, such powers naturally couldn’t do a thing to him.

Due to Trajectory Seeking’s existence, Zhou Wen didn’t use any other identities. Some things couldn’t be used. After some thought, he summoned a Companion Beast.

The Companion Beast Zhou Wen summoned was Demonic Neonate, who had just woken up from her slumber.

The last time Zhou Wen dug out the mysterious phone’s charger in the ancient well, he had discovered a skeleton. The skeleton was wearing a purple crystal pendant. Demonic Neonate had entered an evolutionary state after swallowing the purple crystal. He had been unable to summon her. It was only recently when Zhou Wen was teaching Ming Xiu and company that he had sensed the reestablishment of a mental connection with Demonic Neonate.

After evolving, Demonic Neonate had already reached the Calamity grade.

Demonic Neonate: Calamity (Evolvable)

Life Providence: Child of Dimension

Life Soul: Supreme True Demon

Wheel of Destiny: One Spin.

Terror Form: Great Demon King (S-grade)

Calamity Zone: Demon Domain (Heaven level)

New World: Demon Realm

Strength: 1000

Speed: 1000

Constitution: 1000

Essence Energy: 1000

Talent Skill: Demonic Sword, Heaven Shrouding Bell, Suona

Companion Form: None

Mystic Thearch’s peak Calamity stats were 999. That sufficiently surprised Zhou Wen, making him believe that it was the apex of a Calamity creature. It was impossible for one to have higher stats.

However, Demonic Neonate had actually evolved to the Heaven level. Furthermore, her stats were all at 1000. She had one more point than Mystic Thearch. More importantly, Demonic Neonate had a new ability, New World. He didn’t know what it was for.

According to past experience, Demonic Neonate had a Calamity Zone when she was at the Terror grade. Then, the New World ability that the Calamity-grade Demonic Neonate now had was probably an ability that only the Apocalypse grade had.

Demonic Neonate was also one of the reasons Zhou Wen dared to enter to snap the picture. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Demonic Neonate’s image didn’t change much. She still looked like the purple-robed girl from before. She held the Demonic Sword in her arms, but the Heaven Shrouding Bell and suona had vanished. It was unknown where she had hidden them.

Everyone found it novel that Zhou Wen had summoned a Companion Beast that resembled a human girl.

Although the few humans who had successfully cleared the level previously had also used Companion Beasts, they had all appeared in weapon or armor form. The main combat strength remained human.

Zhou Wen summoned his Companion Beast in its original form, probably planning on using it as his main combat strength. This was a first.

As more and more Guardians and representatives appeared, the effects of human Companion Beasts seemed to weaken. Very few Companion Beasts could fight top-notch representatives. In such situations, the chances of Companion Beasts appearing were decreasing, especially top-notch battles that were carried by Companion Beasts.

Many people were looking forward to seeing what abilities Zhou Wen’s adorable and cold humanoid Companion Beast had.

After Demonic Neonate came out, she floated beside Zhou Wen and glanced at the lake. The Demonic Sword in her arms suddenly jumped out of its scabbard and plunged into the lake.
