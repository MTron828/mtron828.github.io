Chapter 683: Urna

Zhou Wen had already summoned the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and had it appear on his back in the form of dragon wings. He didn’t dare be careless when entering such a strange place in reality.

He turned his head and realized that there was no longer a stone door behind him. Behind him was an endless void. The huge golden Buddha nation was floating in the void like an island while they were standing at the edge of the golden Buddha nation.

Zhou Wen looked around and failed to find a way back. He looked at An Sheng and asked, “Ah Sheng, can you tell the way back?”

An Sheng shook his head and said, “I can’t tell. It’s probably going to be troublesome. Young Master Wen, you have to be careful at all times.”

Leng Zongzheng said, “Look at the spot between the giant Buddha’s eyebrows.”

Zhou Wen and An Sheng looked over and saw a huge piece of sun-like glass between the Buddha’s brows that emitted a strange glow. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“In Buddhism, that’s an Urna. It’s one of the thirty-two aspects of Gautama Buddha. It represents the source of all religions,” An Sheng said.

Leng Zongzheng nodded and said, “An Urna is one of the original forms of Buddha. It shrinks between the eyebrows. And when a craftsman carves a Buddha statue, there’s no way to depict the true appearance of an Urna. They usually just carve a circle or spiral to represent it. Look carefully at the Urna. Do you find anything odd?”

Zhou Wen and An Sheng looked over and felt that the Urna was blinding, as though it was clear glass.

As Truth Listener’s power couldn’t reach such a distance, Zhou Wen didn’t sense any danger descending. He switched to the Small Perfection of Wisdom and the Hell King Life Soul to strengthen his senses before carefully looking at the Urna.

Upon doing so, Zhou Wen immediately realized something. The Urna wasn’t glass. It was clearly a cocoon formed from crystal threads.

“That’s... the cocoon of a Guardian...” Zhou Wen said in surprise.

Leng Zongzheng said with a heavy expression, “It’s probably a cocoon of a Guardian. I originally thought that Dragon Gate Grotto only had one in Dragon’s Well, I didn’t expect there to be another one.”

“Could it be that everything that happened in Dragon Gate Grotto is due to the cocoon of the Guardian? But that doesn’t make sense. Doesn’t a Guardian only choose humans as contractors? Why are the monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird here?” Zhou Wen frowned.

No one could answer his question. The three of them watched from afar as the monk-clothed skeleton walked towards the Buddha and the golden-winged bird flew at high speed.

However, be it the skeleton in monk robes or the golden-winged bird, they couldn’t close the distance. It was as though they were running on the spot.

“There’s a huge terror hidden in this Buddhist kingdom. It’s not something ordinary creatures can pass through. Little Zhou, summon that Great Might Vajra Bull and see if it can approach the Buddha statue,” said Leng Zongzheng.

Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and made it try walking in the direction of the Buddha.

It was odd. The golden-winged bird’s flying speed was tremendous. It could fly hundreds of kilometers with a flap of its wings, but it was unable to approach the huge Buddha.

However, the Great Might Vajra Bull easily closed the distance by slowly walking on the golden bricks. It was about to catch up to the monk-robed skeleton.

“As expected. Only Buddhist-type creatures can travel through the Buddhist kingdom. That monk-robed skeleton isn’t a Buddhist-type creature after all. It’s probably relying on the crystal in its hand to slowly walk towards the Buddha. As for the golden-winged bird, it can’t approach it no matter what. It’s worse than the monk-robed skeleton.” As Leng Zongzheng spoke, he got Zhou Wen to summon the Great Might Vajra Bull back to prevent it from meeting the monk-robed skeleton.

At that moment, a bird’s cry rang through the clouds. The golden-winged bird’s body expanded like a golden cloud that blotted out the sky. It nearly enveloped the entire Buddhist kingdom in its shadow.

It flapped its wings as a terrifying power tore through space and rapidly approached the Buddha. It actually broke through the restrictions of the Buddhist kingdom’s strange powers.

What terrifying might. Only the gigantified Tyrant Behemoth can match it. Zhou Wen was alarmed.

Soon, the golden-winged bird arrived in front of the Buddha statue. As Leng Zongzheng had expected, it had indeed come for the cocoon of the Guardian. It flew to the top of the Buddha’s head and grabbed at it.

The monk-robed skeleton also noticed the golden-winged Bird’s actions. A strange glint flashed in its eyes as it lifted the crystal in its hand. A golden beam shot out from the crystal and instantly struck the golden-winged bird.

The golden-winged bird didn’t dare let the golden beam of light strike it. It gave up on the cocoon of the Guardian and flapped its wings to dodge.

The crystal in the skeleton’s hand constantly emitted golden beams, preventing the golden-winged bird from approaching the cocoon.

The golden-winged bird’s actions were interrupted a few times. It immediately turned ferocious as it flapped its wings and transformed into a golden beam that charged at the monk-robed skeleton. Its eyes flashed with lightning.

As the skeleton advanced, it raised the crystal in its hand and emitted a golden glow that fought the golden-winged bird.

The golden-winged bird seemed to be afraid of the crystal in its hand. It was forced back by the crystal’s light repeatedly.

Leng Zongzheng stared at the monk-clothed skeleton and the crystal in its hand for a long time as though he was thinking about something. After a while, Leng Zongzheng suddenly turned to Zhou Wen and said, “Little Zhou, get the Great Might Vajra Bull to carry us to the Buddha.”

Although Leng Zongzheng didn’t explain why he was doing so, Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull when he saw his solemn expression.

Thankfully, the Great Might Vajra Bull was huge. It was more than big enough to seat three people.

The three of them sat on the bull’s back. The Great Might Vajra Bull immediately ran towards the Buddha.

The monk-robed skeleton needed to walk towards the Buddha step by step. As for the Great Might Vajra Bull, it ran very quickly. Soon, it caught up with the monk-robed skeleton. While it was fighting the golden-winged Roc, it charged past it.

When the monk-robed skeleton saw the Great Might Vajra Bull rush over with three people on it, the strange light in its eyes immediately lit up. The crystal in its hand immediately emitted a golden glow that resembled the one in the mountain temple. It enveloped a large area, including the Great Might Vajra Bull, Zhou Wen, and company.

Zhou Wen immediately felt the Runic Heavy Armor on his body melt like bubbles. Even the Great Might Vajra Bull’s body couldn’t withstand the terrifying golden light. It was like a melting candle as its golden flesh melted.

Leng Zongzheng and Ah Sheng’s situation was the same. The armor on their bodies was melting, and in an instant, their armor was about to collapse.

Zhou Wen pulled out the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed at the monk-robed skeleton. At the same time, he ordered the Great Might Vajra Bull to use the Soul Suppression Bell.

Clang!

The moment the Soul Suppression Bell sounded, the monk-robed skeleton was stunned. The golden light emitted from the crystal in its hand also dimmed.

Taking this opportunity, Leng Zongzheng and Ah Sheng attacked at the same time. Leng Zongzheng summoned the Azure Rainbow Flying Sword that Zhou Wen had previously seen and slashed at the monk-robed skeleton. As for Ah Sheng, he used Love Letter’s text ability and sent a text to the monk-robed skeleton.
