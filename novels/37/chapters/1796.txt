Chapter 1797 As You Wish

The stone saber was very rough. Instead of calling it a saber, it was more like a poorly polished stone rod.

The side near to the blade was rather smooth, but the side of the blade’s spine was abnormally rough. It was even pockmarked.

Only the handle of the saber was very smooth due to being excessively held. It felt like it had smoothened from oxidation.

At the instant the stone saber was pulled out, Zhang Yuzhi’s appeasement seemed to completely fail. The humanoid creature charged up and instantly tore through the air It arrived in front of Zhou Wen with a blast and reached out to grab the stone saber.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to attack the humanoid monster, he suddenly saw a silver flash. Vines grew out from under the humanoid creature’s feet like ropes, tying it up like a dumpling.

Just as the humanoid monster’s finger was about to touch the stone saber, it couldn’t advance any further despite extending it as much as it could.

Zhou Wen looked at the silver-haired Companion Beast who said indifferently, “I said that nothing will happen.”

The humanoid creature roared at Zhou Wen, but no matter how he struggled, he couldn’t escape the vines’ restraints.

“So the abilities of Earth’s Companion Beast are life-type?” Zhou Wen looked at the vines and muttered to himself.

“Bullsh*t. How can you fathom my abilities? This isn’t even strength, just something random,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said angrily as though he had suffered a great insult.

Zhang Yuzhi sized up the silver-haired Companion Beast in surprise. She had spent the most time with humanoid creatures, so no one knew better than her how terrifying its strength was. The silver-haired Companion Beast could actually subdue it without moving a finger. This was already enough to surprise her.

However, none of this shocked her as much as Zhou Wen’s words. She never expected the one in front of her to be Earth’s Companion Beast.

“What are you looking at? That crappy ability of yours is useless against me. Stop wasting your emotions.” The silver-haired Companion Beast glanced coldly at Zhang Yuzhi.

“Zhou Wen, is he really Earth’s Companion Beast? You actually obtained Earth’s Companion Beast?” Zhang Yuzhi said in pleasant surprise.

“What kind of look is that? Is he even up to it...” Halfway through his sentence, the silver-haired Companion Beast seemed to find it inappropriate and said something else. “That punk is just my lackey.”

“Yuzhi, go back for now. I’ll tell you in detail later,” Zhou Wen said to Zhang Yuzhi. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Can you not hurt him?” Zhang Yuzhi hesitated for a moment before looking at the humanoid creature.

“As long as it’s within my control, I won’t harm him.” Zhou Wen knew that Zhang Yuzhi’s ability was very special. She didn’t just control creatures. She had to also devote her feelings and treat the creatures as family.

Zhou Wen originally had no intention of killing the humanoid creature. This humanoid creature was very special, making him even more eager to figure out its origins.

“That’s great.” Zhang Yuzhi tried to convince the humanoid creature to leave with her, but at that moment, her ability was completely ineffective against it. The humanoid creature ignored her and struggled with all its might. It kept staring at the stone saber in Zhou Wen’s hand.

“He won’t die,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said coldly.

Only then did Zhang Yuzhi feel completely relieved. She tried to appease the silver-haired Companion Beast, but it was useless. Only then did she leave Fire God Platform under Zhou Wen’s persuasion.

“I’ve obtained the stone saber, but I don’t feel my connection with that person being severed,” Zhou Wen said to the silver-haired Companion Beast.

“How can it be that easy? What do you think a wish mark is? It doesn’t belong to...” Before the silver-haired Companion Beast could finish its sentence, he stopped as though he realized that he had said too much.

“You want to cooperate with me, but you keep hiding everything from me. How can we cooperate?” Zhou Wen said with a sullen expression.

“It’s pointless telling you certain things. You might not believe me either. Instead, you might become overly cautious which won’t be good for either of us.” The silver-haired Companion Beast pointed at the humanoid creature and said, “This fellow is a little strange. If I’m not wrong, he was originally a human.”

“He’s human?” Zhou Wen knew that the silver-haired Companion Beast was changing the topic, but he was still shocked by his words. “There’s no mistake. He was definitely a human in the past. It’s not strange for a human to mutate, but it’s very strange for him to mutate so completely. Unless...” The silver-haired Companion Beast sized up the humanoid monster and pondered.

“Unless what?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Unless he’d willingly given up his bottom line as a human and had been to that place.” The silver-haired Companion Beast wore a strange expression.

“If you continue talking to me in riddles, our cooperation will end here,” Zhou Wen said with a sullen expression.

“Unless he entered that ship. That’s the only place that can completely transform humans into creatures.” The silver-haired Companion Beast paused and curled his lips. “I also want to explain it to you, but I don’t completely understand it myself. How can I explain it clearly? If you want to know the truth, ask Nüwa yourself.” “Cut the crap. How do I use this stone saber?” Zhou Wen could sense a strange power contained in the stone saber, but this power couldn’t sever the connection between the mark and The Thearch.

“Give me the saber,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said as he extended his hand.

Zhou Wen glanced at the silver-haired Companion Beast before throwing the stone saber at him.

“You are a little braver than your father. You aren’t considered pure trash.” The silver-haired Companion Beast sized up the stone saber and spoke without looking up. It was unknown if it was a compliment or mockery.

Before Zhou Wen could say anything, the silver-haired Companion Beast suddenly held the stone saber in reverse and stabbed it into its chest.

Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. The stone saber penetrated the silver-haired Companion Beast’s chest, with the blade seemingly protruding from his back.

“What are you doing?” Zhou Wen stared at the silver-haired Companion Beast and asked with a frown.

“Indeed, this Human Sovereign Stone Saber isn’t enough. Cut the crap. Success or failure depends on this. I’ll trust you humans one more time,” the silver-haired Companion Beast looked at his chest and whispered.

At the spot where the stone saber touched his chest, silver flames arose as though they were leaking out of his body and burning his flesh.

“Come, pull out the saber.” The silver-haired Companion Beast released the hilt and spread out his hands. He looked up at Zhou Wen as silver light bloomed in his eyes.

Zhou Wen finally understood what he was doing. Companion Beasts couldn’t automatically terminate their contracts with humans, so the contract on the silver-haired Companion Beast probably hadn’t been completely terminated. Now, he wanted to use the stone saber to sever his contract with humans, but this was clearly not enough. Therefore, he could only choose to use this opportunity to have a new contract replace the previous one.

In other words, if he succeeded, the silver-haired Companion Beast would become Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast.

“As you wish.” Zhou Wen reached out and grabbed the hilt of the stone saber again, pulling it out with all his might.
