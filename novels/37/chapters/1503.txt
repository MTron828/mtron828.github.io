Chapter 1504 Four-Star System

It wasn’t completely impossible for Zhou Wen to enter, but he didn’t wish to take the risk. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It took quite some time to search both celestial bodies. Just as Zhou Wen was about to return, his heart suddenly stirred. The Dubhe is one of the Big Dipper stars. Now that Dubhe has changed, have the other six stars changed as well?

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it wouldn’t be a problem to take a look.

The stars that humans could see in the night sky were mostly stars, not planets or other celestial bodies. The other six stars of the Big Dipper were also stars. Although they were somewhat different from Dubhe, the environment of the stars was somewhat similar.

After Zhou Wen teleported over, he only took a look from a close distance, but he didn’t discover any dimensional zones.

When he arrived at the sixth star, Mizar, he didn’t discover anything beyond it. He even deliberately looked at the companion star, Alcor.

Mizar was a famous binary star. Its companion star, Alcor, was one of the few binary stars that could be resolved with the naked eye on Earth. As Alcor had a lower magnitude, it was used in ancient times to test the eyesight of soldiers. To be able to see this star was believed to have a visual acuity of 20/12.5.

When Zhou Wen found Alcor, he realized that there wasn’t only one companion star nearby, but three.

The two pairs of stars revolved around each other. It was far more complicated than what he had seen on Earth. It was a four-star system.

The four stars revolved according to a certain trajectory, allowing for a scene of four suns rising at the same time. It looked extremely magical. Earth was in a single star system, so it was impossible for it to see such a scene.

Zhou Wen suddenly thought of an ancient myth. Legend had it that the sun was a Golden Crow. And in the past, there wasn’t only one Golden Crow, but ten. Under the restrictions of the Celestial Thearch, only one Golden Crow came out every day to provide light to the land.

However, there was once a time when ten Golden Crows appeared together, nearly roasting the ground dry.

A god, Hou Yi, shot down nine Golden Crows with divine arrows, leaving only one Golden Crow to bring light to the land.

If this wasn’t just a legend, but an actual event, Zhou Wen wondered if it was possible that the Solar System was a ten-star system that possessed nine other Companion Beasts at some point in time.

Of course, Zhou Wen was only musing. After all, Companion Beasts didn’t randomly appear, much less come and go as they pleased. Even if they really existed, who could really shoot down nine stars?

Furthermore, a 7-star system was the most that had been found to date. 10-star systems had yet to be found.

Zhou Wen chose one of the stars because he wanted to take a look. However, when he teleported near the celestial body, he was surprised to discover a monument erected on

it.

The monument didn’t look like metal or jade. It was unknown where it was made. Erected on the celestial body, the terrifyingly high temperature and energy blasts couldn’t damage it at all.

Most of the monument was enveloped by flames and high-temperature magma, but the exposed parts were thousands of meters tall. It was black like metal, and it was densely engraved with symbols that Zhou Wen didn’t recognize.

The tiny palm symbol! Zhou Wen looked at it for a while and realized that there was a tiny palm symbol on the side of the monument. He was overwhelmed with a pleasant surprise.

He quickly took out his phone and snapped a picture of the tiny palm symbol. Immediately, the phone entered the download screen.

Unfortunately, I only have one of Mizar’s stars. It’s not Dubhe that appeared on the Cube, Zhou Wen thought regretfully.

As the download didn’t show any signs of completion and Zhou Wen didn’t wish to waste any time, he circled all four stars before heading to the last of the seven stars-Eta Ursae Majoris.

In the end, the stone monument was found only on one celestial body, not elsewhere.

Zhou Wen took quite some time to make such a huge trip. Based on Earth’s calendar, it took him a few days, but the dungeon didn’t finish downloading.

Downloading the Venusian instance dungeon didn’t take that long previously! Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.

There was no point in staying any longer. Zhou Wen teleported back to Earth and looked at the time. He realized that he had been away for more than half a month.

However, compared to interstellar travel that could easily be measured in light-years, Zhou Wen’s teleportation ability was already crazy enough. His trip wasn’t long at all.

Zhou Wen realized that Guide City had changed drastically when he returned.

The people who were originally crowding near the school were living in the nearby city. They weren’t camping outside the school.

Li Xuan is pretty good. I never expected him to have such talent! Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be alarmed when he saw that everyone was behaving in an orderly manner without the panic from before.

Zhou Wen returned to school and went straight to Li Xuan. He realized that there were two people who were chatting with Li Xuan in his room. Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with the two of them. One was Feng Qiuyan, and the other was Ming Xiu.

When Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan saw Zhou Wen, they stood up and shouted in unison, “Coach.”

“Why are you guys here?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

“Coach, I heard that you wish to establish a city. My family got me to come over to take a look. If possible, they plan on moving over,” Ming Xiu said.

Feng Qiuyan also nodded and said, “My family plans to do the same. Coach, if you establish the city, I hope you can leave some space for my Feng family.”

“Are you guys joking?” Zhou Wen knew that the two of them had terrifying strength. Furthermore, with the strength of their families, they had their own cities to begin with. There was no need for them to join Zhou Wen.

Even if they really wanted to choose a place to settle in, the conditions the six families and even the various warlords could provide them were much better than Zhou Wen’s.

“Coach, I’m really not joking,” Ming Xiu said with a smile. “Although our Ming family is in quite a comfy environment, it’s a pity that there isn’t much room for development in that area. The lack of dimensional zones’ resources has already limited the Ming family’s future achievements. We have long been searching for suitable locations. Since you want to establish the city, I naturally won’t miss such an opportunity.”

“I’m afraid you don’t know much about Guide City’s situation, right? It’s not that easy to survive here. It’s still unknown if it can be built.” Zhou Wen wasn’t completely confident that he could build a city here, nor did he wish to lie to them.

“Danger and opportunity are two sides of the same coin. How can we gain anything if we don’t take risks? Our Ming family has long studied the situation in Guide City. To be honest, our Ming family had considered occupying Guide City in the past, but we ultimately gave up because of a lack of confidence. Ignoring our Ming family, even the six families wouldn’t dare set up a city here.”

Ming Xiu paused for a moment before saying solemnly, “Now, all the major factions are waiting to see your outcome. No one thinks that you can really establish a city here, but I think that you will definitely be able to get a foothold here. Therefore, no matter what the family chooses, I will stay here.”

“Me too,” Feng Qiuyan added succinctly.
