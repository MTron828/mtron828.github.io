Chapter 1404: The Unbelievable Heavenly Robe

“It looks like the Cape family has been suspicious of the Heavenly Robe’s effects from the beginning. They have long planned to make this request, and to do it now, if we don’t agree to this condition that seems to be beneficial to us at this step in the negotiations, it’s equivalent to telling them that there’s a problem with the Heavenly Robe. When the time comes, I’m afraid no one will buy our Heavenly Robe. But if we agree…”

An Sheng paused for a moment to which Zhou Wen replied, “Then agree to it.”

An Sheng was taken aback. “Young Master, didn’t you say that only Companion Beasts with high luck can bring out the effects of the Heavenly Robe? Now, the Cape family wants you to only use the Heavenly Robe. How are you going to clear it?”

“That’s not a problem. If they want to see the Heavenly Robe, let them. I can now achieve the same effect even without the Heavenly Robe,” Zhou Wen said.

“I see. That’s great. In that case, I need to work harder.” An Sheng’s eyes revealed a cold glint.

Zhou Wen knew that it wouldn’t be wrong to leave such matters to An Sheng. He wouldn’t suffer any losses, so all he needed to do was prepare to clear the dungeon.

After a day, An Sheng had already finished negotiating with Wood and company.

Zhou Wen could do the attempt, but other than the Essence Crystal mine, the Cape family needed to provide an additional hundred tonnes of Essence Crystals.

This hundred tonnes of Essence Crystals was equivalent to a deposit. After Zhou Wen completed the test, they would hand over the Essence Crystal mine.

Under An Sheng’s arrangements, Zhou Wen signed a contract with the Cape family’s representative. If Zhou Wen couldn’t rely on Heavenly Robe to clear the Venusian dimensional zone and enter the rankings, he would have to pay an additional hundred tonnes of Essence Crystals for the breach of contract.

The moment the contract was signed, the Cape family released the contract’s content through their official channels.

If Zhou Wen couldn’t do it and refused to refund the deposit, the entire Federation would know of this matter. Even if the An family did refund the Essence Crystals, it would deal a huge blow to Zhou Wen and Luoyang’s An family’s reputation. It would still spell quite a loss and setback.

Regardless, Zhou Wen had to clear it.

“Zhou Wen actually agreed to the Cape family’s request?” Xia Liuchuan wore a look of surprise after reading the press release.

Anyone would find it unbelievable that a Terror-grade Companion Beast—Heavenly Robe—could perfectly withstand a Calamity-grade attack. There had to be other supplementary means and Companion Beast abilities augmenting it to reach that level.

Many people had the same thoughts as Xia Liuchuan. After Zhang Chunqiu finished reading, he revealed a pensive expression. Clearly, he didn’t believe that a Terror-grade Heavenly Robe could clear the Venusian dimensional zone.

However, Zhou Wen had agreed to such a request. This left Zhang Chunqiu somewhat puzzled. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

With the same question in mind, many people focused on the Cube, hoping to see how Zhou Wen would handle it.

Zhou Wen didn’t make them wait too long. Soon, the Cube lit up and a projection of the Venusian dimensional zone’s external platform appeared.

Zhou Wen, who was wearing the Heavenly Robe, stood on the platform.

He was only wearing the Heavenly Robe. Apart from that, he didn’t have anything else on him. He didn’t even have accessories like rings. He looked extremely clean and tidy.

Here it comes. Could it be that the Heavenly Robe is really that effective against the Calamity creature in Venus??Xia Liuchuan found it unbelievable when he saw Zhou Wen’s attire. He clearly didn’t plan on using other Companion Beasts.

The Cape family paid more attention to this battle. If Heavenly Robe could really perfectly dodge the Calamity-grade attack, they naturally wanted to obtain it.

Ignoring the value of being on the rankings, just dodging a Calamity-grade attack made it priceless.

However, they were also very suspicious. If it really had such powerful abilities, why did Zhou Wen want to sell it? Although the reason given by the An family made sense, they were still somewhat suspicious.

Zhou Wen dripped his blood to activate the Venusian dimensional zone as everyone watched him enter.

Upon seeing the Metal Guard, Zhou Wen summoned Sword Pill and killed it with one strike.

Large numbers of Metal Guards rushed out and were wiped out by Zhou Wen in the blink of an eye. Their bullets couldn’t injure him at all.

After a Golden Battle God rushed out, the bullets that shot out could only circle around Zhou Wen without touching him.

Zhou Wen charged forward and killed it with one strike. He didn’t even dodge the bullet.

The six Golden Battle Gods were killed by Zhou Wen, and a Companion Egg dropped. It made one envious and jealous.

Zhou Wen put away the Companion Egg and charged into the tunnel.

Zhang Yuzhi and company, who were watching the Cube’s live broadcast, couldn’t help but feel nervous. After all, it was still doubtful if the Terror-grade Heavenly Robe could single-handedly block a Calamity-grade bullet.

Bang!

After the gunshot, a Calamity-grade bullet appeared around Zhou Wen. It spun around him like a bolt of lightning. It looked very similar to Zhou Wen’s previous attempts at clearing the level, perhaps even stronger.

Previously, it was only the sure-kill bullet that had spun around Zhou Wen, but now, even the bullets at the beginning were spinning around him.

Zhou Wen ignored the bullets as he quickly traversed the tunnel and headed for the Golden Palace.

Bang! Bang!

Gunshots sounded as bullets appeared around Zhou Wen one after another, but they could only circle around him and failed to injure him, nor could they stop him from advancing.

Zhou Wen was very fast. Before the sure-kill seventh bullet shot out, he had already arrived in front of the Golden Palace.

But Zhou Wen stopped in front of the stairs just like Immortal. He didn’t ascend the Golden Palace but waited for the seventh bullet to arrive.

Bang!

The sure-kill seventh shot finally sounded as a bullet with lightning sparks appeared around Zhou Wen. It was more dazzling than the halo formed by the other six bullets.

Zhou Wen stood there without moving, allowing the seven bullets to circle around him.

That Heavenly Robe… can actually perfectly restrain the Calamity-grade bullets…?It wasn’t just the Cape family. Many people who had been very interested in the Heavenly Robe widened their eyes.

This wasn’t the end. Zhou Wen, who had already proven his Heavenly Robe’s abilities, still hadn’t left.

The Calamity-grade bullets kept firing over, but none of them could injure Zhou Wen. When the second round of sure-kill bullets circled around Zhou Wen, the Overseer Manor’s phone and An Sheng’s phones nearly exploded from all the ringing.

Zhou Wen didn’t use any other Companion Beasts, nor did he use any offensive or defensive means. This undoubtedly meant that the Heavenly Robe was the best of the best. It had unbelievable dodging abilities. Obtaining it not only allowed one to enter the rankings, but it also greatly ensured their safety. How could anyone who had the means to acquire it not want it?

Instantly, the Overseer Manor’s phone was busier than a particular brand’s after-sales service call.

At that moment, Zhou Wen finally walked up the stairs and arrived in front of the Golden Palace. The scene that happened next drove people crazy.

Zhou Wen’s name appeared on the rankings, but it wasn’t a three-star. Behind his name were five shiny golden stars. Furthermore, he was ranked first, squeezing out Immortal, who had only been in first place for a few days.

Thankfully, only one phone connection could be established at any one time; otherwise, the Overseer Manor would definitely be flooded with calls.
