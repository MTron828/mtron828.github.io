The masked man’s face looked intact, but his clothes were tattered like a beggar’s.

However, from the torn parts of his clothes, one could see that his skin was crystalline like jade. There were some strange red spots that quickly vanished.

“From the looks of it, my body has really aged. If I were at my peak, such strength wouldn’t even be able to damage my clothes. I actually suffered injuries. A human’s body is indeed too weak...” The masked man walked out step by step. The mask on his face seemed to be enveloped by a mysterious fog as it emitted a terrifying aura.

He was like a devil that had walked out of hell. Even the ice maiden’s expression changed.

The ice maiden stared at the masked man and asked through gritted teeth, “You have an S-grade Terror form?”

“As expected of the Ice Demon Monarch’s descendant. You do have some keen eyesight. If it wasn’t for my body being too old, your strength wouldn’t have been able to injure me,” the masked man said indifferently, but he still walked towards the ice maiden step by step. The closer he was to the ice maiden, the more her eyes couldn’t leave the mask.

“Ice Maiden, give me the Heaven Shrouding Bell.” Zhou Wen suddenly appeared not far from the ice maiden. Three minutes of invisibility had passed, and he couldn’t hide his body any longer.

When the ice maiden heard Zhou Wen’s voice, the hate for him exceeded the influence the mask had on her. She subconsciously turned to look at Zhou Wen and raised the Heaven Shrouding Bell in her hand.

She meant to use the Heaven Shrouding Bell against Zhou Wen, but in the masked man’s eyes, it was as though she was obediently giving the Heaven Shrouding Bell to Zhou Wen.

The masked man instantly arrived in front of the ice maiden and reached out to grab the Heaven Shrouding Bell. Before the ice maiden could react, he had already grabbed the Heaven Shrouding Bell.

The ice maiden wanted to resist, but her strength was ultimately inferior to the masked man. The masked man forcefully snatched away the Heaven Shrouding Bell.

At the instant the masked man succeeded, his expression changed drastically. In her Terror form, Demonic Neonate had appeared above him with the demonic sword in hand. It slashed at the mask.

Crack!

The mask was split apart by the demonic sword, leaving a crack in the middle.

Pfft!

Blood spewed out of the masked man’s mouth as he was sent flying. The Heaven Shrouding Bell he had just snatched was snatched back by Demonic Neonate.

Demonic Neonate held the Heaven Shrouding Bell in one hand and the demonic sword in the other as she charged at the masked man.

Zhou Wen couldn’t see her figure at all, but he could see the mask on the masked man’s face being slashed open. It was about to shatter.

Crack!

The mask finally couldn’t withstand the terrifying destructive force and shattered into pieces. The masked man’s face, that was extremely similar to Lance, was revealed again.

However, his face was devoid of color. Instead, blood spewed out of his mouth as his body rapidly aged. In the blink of an eye, he went from a young man to a middle-aged man. Then, the wrinkles on his body increased. Soon, he became an old man.

“Companion Beast... A Terror-grade Companion Beast... How is this possible...” The masked man’s body slammed into the wall, creating a dent. His body sank in, but his eyes were filled with disbelief as he looked at Demonic Neonate, who had stabbed her sword into his glabella. It was as though he had seen a ghost.

“From the looks of it, you have no use for my body. Do you have anything to say before you die? If you have any unfulfilled wishes and it’s not too troublesome, I don’t mind helping you,” Zhou Wen said to the masked man from afar.

Although the mask had been shattered and the demonic sword had stabbed into his skull, the masked man didn’t die immediately. Zhou Wen didn’t dare approach him to prevent himself from suffering a counterattack.

The masked man didn’t move, but the ice maiden suddenly moved. With a terrifying ice beam, she struck Zhou Wen.

However, just as she moved, a huge creature rushed out from the calabash in Zhou Wen’s hand. Seven strange dragon-like tentacles spewed out white liquid that blocked the ice maiden’s ice beam. At the same time, it wrapped around her body.

Another Terror-grade! The ice maiden was already speechless from shock.

She already understood that she had been tricked by Zhou Wen and had helped him fight. However, while Demonic Neonate was dealing with the masked man, she believed that it wouldn’t be difficult to kill Zhou Wen with all her remaining strength.

However, she never expected Zhou Wen to have another Terror-grade creature on him.

Originally, the Seven Seas Dragon King wasn’t the ice maiden’s match. Furthermore, the ice element was more effective against the Seven Seas Dragon King. However, the ice maiden had expended too much of her strength, leaving her with less than thirty percent of her combat strength. She was no match for the Seven Seas Dragon King.

Is this really Earth? The ice maiden found it unbelievable. A human actually had a Terror-grade Companion Beast and had a Terror-grade creature loyal to him. It was unimaginable.

Seeing that the ice maiden was restrained, her body was entangled by the Seven Seas Dragon King’s tentacles and that she was covered in the white liquid, Zhou Wen finally heaved a sigh of relief.

However, the masked man suddenly laughed strangely. As he laughed, he said crazily, “Interesting. It’s really interesting. A mere human actually has a Terror-grade Companion Beast. Furthermore, he can order a Terror creature to do things. This is really interesting. Only such a body is worthy of me, the Bizarre God. I want your body.”

“Are you dreaming?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he ordered Demonic Neonate to quickly kill the masked man.

Demonic Neonate pulled out the demonic sword mercilessly as blood and brain matter spewed out from the masked man’s head.

Without any hesitation, Demonic Neonate brandished her sword again and cleaved open Bizarre God’s head. As for the Grim Demon in the demon sword, he rushed out and opened his mouth in excitement, swallowing Bizarre God’s corpse. With a few chomps, it swallowed everything.

After swallowing Bizarre God’s corpse, the demonic aura on Grim Demon’s body surged. It looked like he was about to evolve.

Demonic Neonate waved her hand and Grim Demon returned to the demonic sword. The demonic sword automatically returned to its scabbard and returned to her hand.

That’s a... Guardian... A Companion Beast’s Guardian... The ice maiden was already dumbfounded. She couldn’t believe what she had seen today and felt like she was dreaming.

An Epic human had a Terror-grade Companion Beasts; yet, this Companion Beast actually had a Guardian. What was this? It was like a fantasy story.

Even in her dreams, the ice maiden had never imagined that something like this would happen.

Is this fellow really human? The ice maiden had already given up struggling and looked at Zhou Wen in a daze. However, no matter how she looked at it, Zhou Wen was only an Epic human.
