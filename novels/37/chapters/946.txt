Chapter 947: Unable to Walk Straight

“Coach is indeed Coach. You’ve already killed so many Guardians? Can you teach me how to kill Guardians?” Feng Qiuyan said in admiration.

“Is this even a normal chat?” Li Xuan was somewhat speechless.

The four of them set off together. Zhou Wen had already walked the first part of the journey, but now, it felt different from before.

Not only were many roads destroyed, but after leaving the city, the chances of encountering break-out creatures increased significantly. Many break-out creatures were only at the Legendary stage. The reason they could break out was clearly because the dimensional zones’ seals had weakened, not because they were strong enough.

The further away they were from the city, the denser the plants grew. The environment that had been destroyed by humans in the past had not only recovered, but it had also become terrifying. The plants had mutated. Although they hadn’t reached the standards of dimensional creatures, they had become extremely huge. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Large trees that were dozens of meters tall and flowers that were more than a meter in diameter were rather common now. Most of the paths were awash with plants.

Furthermore, new dimensional zones were constantly appearing. It was very possible that a spot he passed this time was fine, yet it could become a dimensional zone the next time he came here.

“Li Xuan, what are you up to?” Zhou Wen saw that Li Xuan had suddenly turned odd.

“I didn’t do anything?” Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement, unsure what he meant.

“If you aren’t doing anything, why are you walking so weirdly?” Zhou Wen stared at Li Xuan.

“I’m not walking weirdly. I’m walking very normally,” Li Xuan said as he took another step.

However, this step immediately made Li Xuan’s expression change. This was because he clearly wanted to walk straight forward, but to his surprise, he took a diagonal step and blocked Zhou Wen’s path.

“That’s impossible. I’m not senile. It’s impossible that I can’t even walk straight...” Li Xuan refused to believe it as he took a few more steps. However, every step he took was diagonal. None of them were straight.

“What the hell... There’s something strange here... Try walking... There’s no way to walk in a straight line here...” Li Xuan’s expression turned nasty. He checked himself but didn’t discover any problems.

Feng Qiuyan and Zhou Wen took two steps. They walked very straight without any signs of walking diagonally.

“It’s completely fine,” Zhou Wen said.

“I don’t believe it.” Seeing that Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan were fine, Li Xuan took two more steps.

Li Xuan tried his best to control his footsteps. He had already used his Essence Energy, but after he stepped out, he went diagonal again. He couldn’t walk straight.

“President, stop teasing us. We still have a long journey ahead of us,” Feng Qiuyan said.

Li Xuan felt like crying. “What’s wrong with me? I really can’t walk straight.”

“But we have no problems,” Feng Qiuyan said as he took a few steps back. He walked very straight.

Li Xuan suddenly stared at Feng Qiuyan as though he had discovered something. He said loudly, “Wait, Little Yanyan. Don’t walk in a straight line. Walk diagonally.”

“What’s wrong with walking diagonally? It’s very easy,” Feng Qiuyan said as he took a step forward diagonally.

However, when he took this step, his feet walked straight ahead. This step was so straight that even a ceremonial guard’s standard marching wasn’t as straight as his.

“What’s going on?” Feng Qiuyan was somewhat dumbfounded. He gathered his Essence Energy and attempted to take a few more steps, but the outcome was the same. No matter how hard he tried to walk diagonally, he ended up walking in a straight line.

“I knew it. There’s definitely something odd here,” Li Xuan shouted.

The two of them looked at Zhou Wen at the same time. One of them could only walk diagonally while the other could only walk in a straight line. Now, they wanted to know how it was with Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen tried walking, but he could only walk in a straight line. If he wanted to walk diagonally, he couldn’t walk out no matter what. He walked forward the moment he moved his feet.

Zhou Wen tried walking backward again, but he soon realized that he couldn’t.

“Take a look at the map. Where is this place?” Zhou Wen had already realized that something was amiss, but he was even more certain now.

Li Xuan was already looking at it on his phone. This was an old map he had downloaded. It wasn’t for navigation, but to see if there were any legendary scenic spots on the map.

“There doesn’t seem to be anything special nearby. It’s just an ordinary mountainous area. Could it be that an unknown dimensional zone has appeared here? Or has some dimensional creature affected this place?” Li Xuan looked at the map for a while but didn’t discover any problems.

Zhou Wen tried switching to the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder before taking two more steps. He realized that he could now retreat and walk diagonally.

“How are you able to walk diagonally again?” Li Xuan asked in surprise when he saw Zhou Wen take two steps diagonally.

“I have an ability that can restrain the taboos of dimensional zones. From the looks of it, this place has transformed into a dimensional zone. However, I wonder where we entered.” Zhou Wen sized up his surroundings and saw mountains and rivers. The scenery wasn’t bad, but he didn’t discover any dimensional creatures.

“Since it’s a dimensional zone, let’s walk forward. It just prevents me from walking straight, so it’s not a big deal,” Li Xuan said.

His strength didn’t rely on movement techniques to begin with, so the restriction of movement was nothing to him.

“What about you?” Zhou Wen asked Feng Qiuyan.

“It shouldn’t have much of an impact,” Feng Qiuyan said.

“Alright, let’s continue walking forward,” Zhou Wen said as he summoned a Poison Bat, hoping to get it to scout ahead.

However, after the Poison Bat was summoned, it fell to the ground, unable to fly no matter how hard it struggled.

“There’s a taboo here that prevents flight,” Li Xuan said in surprise.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to unsummon the Poison Bat before summoning a Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior to scout ahead.

The Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior didn’t have any problems, but he could only walk in a straight line. He couldn’t walk diagonally.

The Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior walked far ahead while Zhou Wen and company followed behind. Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan were fine, but Li Xuan could only walk diagonally. It was extremely awkward.

They walked for quite some time without discovering any dimensional creatures. The Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior had already walked to the river in front of them and was about to cross it.

As they couldn’t fly, they had no choice but to cross the river. Zhou Wen was afraid that there would be something odd in the river, so he got the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior to head into the river as they watched by the edge.

The river wasn’t deep. The deepest part only reached the waist of the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior. There wasn’t any problem when the Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior crossed the river.

However, just as he reached the opposite bank, a bang was heard.
