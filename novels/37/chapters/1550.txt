Chapter 1551: Digging Up a Treasure

Translator: CKtalon 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Zhou Wen came from the cliff—across the cliff was Lost Paradise. He had previously observed the cliff and didn’t discover anything amiss.

However, the little beast ran firmly towards the edge of the cliff, leaving Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled. Could it be that the treasure is at the bottom of the cliff?

Soon, Zhou Wen dispelled this thought because the little beast stopped by the cliff and sniffed a stone.

Could it be that there’s something wrong with that stone??Zhou Wen’s mind locked onto the stone, but he didn’t discover any problems. It was as though it was a very ordinary mountain rock that was no different from the stones beside it.

“It looks like this little fellow of yours isn’t very reliable,” Grim Demon said.

The tiny beast seemed to understand him. It bared its teeth at Grim Demon and squealed as though it was cursing him. Zhou Wen didn’t even have the chance to answer.

“You can see me?” Grim Demon was slightly taken aback. He was in his Terror form, so it was impossible for others to see him without reaching the Terror grade.

This little beast’s level was clearly very low. It was impossible for it to be at the Terror grade. For it to see Grim Demon left him incredulous.

The little beast continued squealing at him, clearly able to see him.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about them. He walked to the stone and carefully sized it up. The stone was likely an ordinary mountain rock, but there was something very strange.

The area around the cliff was a platform. The other parts were flat. Only this stone protruded a foot tall and its surface was very smooth from the weathering.

“You, come over.” Zhou Wen called out to a person kneeling not far away and asked, “Why is there a protruding stone here?”

The person thought for a moment and answered, “Your Devilish Excellency, this stone has been here for a long time. I don’t know when it appeared because it’s on the edge of the cliff. We usually tie a rope around it and use the rope to go down the cliff to find some edible plants and fungi.”

“Call your City Lord over,” Zhou Wen instructed when he saw that he couldn’t get much from him.

Not long after, the elder jogged over. After meeting him, he knelt again.

“Enough, stop prostrating. Tell me, when did this stone appear here?” Zhou Wen waved his hand to stop the elder from kneeling.

He wasn’t used to such etiquette to begin with, and it was a waste of time.

Only then did the elder stand properly and say, “Your Devilish Excellency, I’ve only heard from the elders that there was a monument erected here before Regretless City was established. As my elders didn’t know who erected it here, they didn’t dare to randomly remove it. Nothing special came out of this monument over time; therefore, from my elders onwards, they used this monument as a pillar, tying ropes to it to aid our descent to search for food.”

The elder paused for a moment before continuing, “Much later, due to the elements and a few accidents, the stone monument snapped. Later on, it underwent a few problems, leaving only this tiny piece in our generation. We aren’t too sure of its origins.”

A stone monument??Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at the protruding stone that was a foot tall. It was very difficult to associate it with a stone monument.

Furthermore, this monument had actually shattered. If it was really that magical, how could it shatter so easily?

The people from Regretless City didn’t know much about the stone. Zhou Wen waved his hand and dismissed them.

The tiny beast ran in front of Zhou Wen and extended its claws. From the looks of it, it was asking Zhou Wen for its Companion Eggs.

This fellow was like a weasel, but what it liked to eat wasn’t chicken eggs, but Companion Eggs. It loved eating the higher-level ones.

Zhou Wen had previously fed it quite a number of Companion Eggs. Although their levels weren’t high and most of them were at the Epic stage, it hadn’t evolved over the years.

“Are you sure this stone is a treasure?” Zhou Wen asked the little beast.

The little beast pointed at the stone with its claws and made another digging motion.

Zhou Wen immediately understood that the treasure wasn’t the stone, but beneath it.

Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to dig up the stone. It was most suitable for such manual labor.

Tyrant Behemoth didn’t transform into its huge form. It shrank to a height of four to five meters, extended its claws, and swiped down, slicing open the stone like tofu.

After moving its claws a few times, the protruding rock was dug out completely, leaving a hole more than a meter deep.

Clang!

Tyrant Behemoth’s claws seemed to touch something as they emitted a metallic clang.

Zhou Wen hurriedly walked over and looked into the pit. He realized that there was a green metal object. It looked like a bronze artifact.

He summoned Bamboo Blade and removed the rocks beside the bronze artifact. Soon, the bronze artifact was completely exposed.

What’s this??Zhou Wen sized up the bronze artifact that had been taken out of the pit, but after looking at it for a while, he couldn’t figure out what it was.

This item looked very strange. Zhou Wen had never seen such a bronze artifact.

Typical bronze tools, such as tripod cauldrons, furnaces, and spoons were nothing to speak of. Even some unknown bronze artifacts looked somewhat similar.

However, this bronze artifact was different from the bronze artifacts Zhou Wen had seen in the past.

This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen a bronze artifact that looked like a radish. Furthermore, it was a short and fat radish. It was more than a meter tall. More importantly, there were three leaves at the top. It looked like a huge radish no matter how he looked at it.

What’s this? Could it be a radish planted in the Garden of Eden??Zhou Wen reached out and tapped it, producing a metallic sound. It was hard to tell if it was bronze.

There were many mysterious symbols engraved on the bronze artifact, but unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t know what they meant.

Zhou Wen increased his strength bit by bit and finally, despite using all his strength, he failed to leave a dent in the bronze artifact that looked like a radish.

It’s really something good.?His strength was already comparable to a Human Realm creature. Even his strength couldn’t damage it. Just the material’s worth alone was definitely something good.

The radishes planted in the Garden of Eden are indeed extraordinary.?Zhou Wen didn’t store the bronze artifact in the chaos space. Instead, he got Grim Demon to guard it.

He wanted to see if there were any problems with it to prevent himself from bringing trouble back.

“Is that all there is here? Are there any other treasures?” Zhou Wen turned to ask the little beast.

The little beast hesitated for a moment and looked in the direction of the cemetery.. In the end, it shook its head as though it was afraid of something.
