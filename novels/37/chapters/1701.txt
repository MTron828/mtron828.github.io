Chapter 1702 Silence

Many core members of Guide Ancient City stood on the city walls to watch the battle. The Zhang family, the Xia family, as well as the newly arrived Niten Flying Immortal Palace’s Sei Gasakai, Honn Shinsakura, Shiraishi Satomi, and company.

Naturally, there were also many original members of Guide Ancient City. When they saw Ming Xiu fight Karoman, they felt somewhat uneasy. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Swordsman Tomorrow was quite famous, but compared to a figure like Karoman who was in the limelight, he was much weaker.

It was especially so for Sei Gasakai and the other people from the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. They believed that Zhou Wen was very strong and could fight Karoman, but who was Ming Xiu? They weren’t too sure and had some doubts.

However, when Ming Xiu really began fighting Karoman, everyone was shocked.

The intensity of the battle exceeded many people’s expectations. Although Karoman’s might was unparalleled, he didn’t seem to be overwhelmingly strong when facing Ming Xiu. It could even be said that he was restrained by the slow swordplay. It was difficult to determine the victor.

“Mr. Zhou is really godlike. Just a disciple of his is on par with Karoman. It’s truly breathtaking,” Sei Gasakai said with a sigh.

“It was indeed the right choice for us to come to Guide Ancient City.” The Elders had long forgotten how they had objected to Honn Shinsakura coming to Guide Ancient City. Their faces were blooming with joy.

An existence like Karoman could only fight Zhou Wen’s disciple to such an extent. Guide Ancient City’s immense strength far exceeded their imagination. It was as unfathomable as the sea.

In fact, they had been rather surprised recently. The Zhang and Xia families had a large number of businesses in Guide Ancient City. This was completely different from what they had imagined.

It was especially shocking that the Zhang family’s princess, Zhang Yuzhi, was in Guide Ancient City.

In fact, the Zhang and Xia families were also very surprised. They knew that Ming Xiu was very strong, but they never expected him to be this strong.

“The Ancient City has finally produced a representative,” Zhang Yuzhi said with a sigh. It was unknown what she was thinking.

The person who was most surprised was Karoman himself. Ming Xiu’s sword technique looked ordinary, and each move looked simple and unadorned. It was even a little slow, but it brought him great trouble.

The most troublesome temporal-type attacks! Karoman had already identified Ming Xiu’s temporal-type abilities, but he still found it challenging fighting him.

Due to the time lag, the sword that Karoman’s eyes saw might not be the real sword. Perhaps it was a sword from a second ago, or perhaps from another second before. He found it difficult to deal with it.

Originally, Karoman wanted to defeat Ming Xiu using technique, but now, he was rather depressed. He couldn’t see the possibility of winning.

In that case, I can only crush everything with absolute strength. Karoman decided to release all his strength and carry out a large-scale destructive attack, preventing Ming Xiu from using those headache-inducing techniques.

Who cares if it happened a second or two ago. The power that burned like the sun for all eternity could destroy everything over time. As the representative of the Sun race, this was also the power that Karoman was best at.

Just as Karoman was about to release all his strength, he suddenly heard Zhou Wen, who was watching the battle from afar, say, “Guide City has thousands of years of history. It wasn’t easy to preserve many things to this day. It’s best if you restrain yourself. Don’t destroy the precious wealth that was a witness to history.”

Guide Ancient City was a dimensional zone. No matter how intense the battle outside was, it was difficult for it to affect the interior of the ancient city.

However, the area outside Guide City didn’t have the ability to protect itself. Once an existence at the level of Karoman completely unleashed his strength for a large-scale attack, the entire city would probably be leveled.

Although there were no more humans in the city, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to see the area outside Ancient City reduced to charred ruins.

Karoman sneered inwardly. Are you my father? Must I obey you? Of course, you don’t want me to use my strength to defeat this fellow. As for whether that crappy city will be destroyed, what has it got to do with me? I must take Shiraishi Satomi away today. No one can stop me.

As he thought about it, the Golden Divine Light on Karoman’s body expanded and was about to devour everything nearby.

At the instant the Golden Divine Light expanded, Karoman heard Zhou Wen say something like “how disobedient.” He didn’t clearly hear the words because he wasn’t in the mood to hear him. His heart was filled with horror.

At that instant, the Sun God power on Karoman’s body vanished without a trace. It was as though an omnipotent god had been struck down to the mortal world and had his godhood skinned, reducing him to an ordinary mortal.

The Sun God power naturally wouldn’t vanish. However, in Zhou Wen’s Teacher Domain, the circulation of the Sun God power was restricted, preventing him from releasing it out of his body.

Without the Sun God power, even though Karoman’s physique was still good, it was difficult for him to use it against Ming Xiu.

Ming Xiu didn’t take the opportunity to defeat Karoman. He sheathed his sword and stood there without continuing the battle.

As for Karoman, he looked at Zhou Wen in horror. He didn’t know how Zhou Wen had done it, but it was clearly Zhou Wen’s doing.

“I already said that if you want to fight, fight. However, don’t destroy anything here.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he removed the restrictions of the Teacher Domain on the Sun God power, restoring the right to use it.

“Continue,” Zhou Wen said.

Continue? Continue my ass! Karoman stood there with an odd expression. He didn’t move for a long time as ten thousand curses roared in his heart.

In Karoman’s eyes, Guide Ancient City was like an empty city, one that he could come and go as he pleased as though it was empty.

But now, Guide Ancient City had become as dangerous as a dragon’s pool or a tiger’s den in his eyes. It was also like an evil demon’s den that was enveloped by a mysterious demonic fog. It made Karoman feel reverence.

Guide Ancient City naturally hadn’t changed. However, the pressure Ming Xiu exerted on Karoman, as well as the fear from how Zhou Wen suddenly made it difficult for him to release the Sun God power, changed his state of mind.

It was hard for him to imagine that there were two terrifying existences in such a small city. It was especially so for Zhou Wen, who made it difficult for him to release the Sun God power. It made him feel fear deep down.

Without the Sun God power, Karoman was like a bird that had lost its wings or a horse without legs. The horror was not something an ordinary person could imagine.

Karoman didn’t know if there were any more terrifying existences in this small city, but he no longer had any fighting spirit. His lofty aura had long vanished without a trace.

Karoman didn’t move, as though an awkward atmosphere was spreading in the air.

“Why don’t we switch locations?” Ming Xiu spoke, finally breaking the darn silence.
