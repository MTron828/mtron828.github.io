Chapter 856: I Just Want to Set Off Fireworks

“Die! My Giant God Sovereign is invincible.” Moses controlled the Giant God Sovereign armor and threw a punch at Tyrant Behemoth.

Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as Tyrant Behemoth returned to him. Since he knew that Moses’s Guardian was good at reflecting strength, a Strength-type Companion Beast like Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t suitable for battle.

“Without Tyrant Behemoth, how are you going to fight me? Zhou Wen, come out and die. I’ll leave your corpse intact.” Moses chased after Zhou Wen while using words to agitate him.

Zhou Wen wasn’t moved at all. As he rapidly moved, he also thought of a way to kill Giant God Sovereign.

Giant God Sovereign’s defense wasn’t weaker than Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength. It also had the ability to reflect strength. It was difficult to break through Giant God Sovereign armor’s defense.

It was not difficult to kill Moses, but killing him was useless. As an equal in the contract, Giant God Sovereign could escape and choose another person to contract.

Zhou Wen’s main target was Giant God Sovereign, not Moses.

The only thing worth rejoicing about is that this Giant God Sovereign shouldn’t have the ability to undergo Terror transformation. There’s still a chance of killing him, Zhou Wen thought.

If it were an ordinary Guardian, Zhou Wen would have killed it long ago if he sneaked an attack with Invisibility Cloak. However, Giant God Sovereign’s defense was just too powerful. This wasn’t a problem that could be resolved with a sneak attack.

Moses was getting closer and closer to Zhou Wen. Just as he was about to catch up to him, his eyes burned with killing intent. “Zhou Wen, you can’t escape.”

“Don’t waste your breath on him. Kill him and snatch back the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg,” Charlie shouted with red eyes. With so many people dead, they finally had a chance to kill Zhou Wen.

As long as they could kill Zhou Wen and retrieve the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg, everything would be worth it.

Just as they were about to catch up to Zhou Wen, they suddenly saw Zhou Wen summon a Companion Beast. It looked like a huge pangolin as Zhou Wen rode on its back.

They only knew of the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg, but they didn’t know what it looked like.

Seeing Zhou Wen summon such a Companion Beast, they imagined that Zhou Wen wanted to risk his life. Without any hesitation, Moses threw a punch. Even Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t fight Giant God Sovereign head-on, much less such an inconspicuous Companion Beast.

Boom!

Moses punched down, blasting a huge crater in the ground, but Zhou Wen and the Companion Beast were nowhere to be seen.

Could it be!

Moses and Charlie had a bad feeling.

Turning their heads, they realized that Zhou Wen was already dozens of meters away. Moses threw another punch. This time, he saw it clearly. The pangolin that Zhou Wen was sitting on burrowed into the ground and vanished. When they emerged again, they were already a hundred meters away.

“Earth Elemental Beast... He actually hatched Earth Elemental Beast... How is this possible...” Charlie shouted indignantly.

No matter how strong Giant God Sovereign was, it was useless if he couldn’t catch up to the Earth Elemental Beast. It was already impossible for him to kill Zhou Wen today, much less snatch the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg. Even if they killed Zhou Wen, the Companion Beast that had already hatched would vanish with its master.

Moses was stunned. He did not expect such an outcome.

“Count yourself lucky.” Seeing that the situation was hopeless, Moses wanted to retreat.

“Who said you can leave?” Zhou Wen rode on the Earth Beast’s back and blocked Moses’s path.

“If you didn’t have the Earth Elemental Beast to escape, you would have long been killed by me. How dare you say such things in front of me?” Moses said coldly as he walked towards Zhou Wen, hoping to stomp him and the Earth Elemental Beast to death.

Zhou Wen remained unmoved as he summoned Tyrant Behemoth. At the same time, he fed the Rejuvenation Pill he had recently obtained to Tyrant Behemoth, allowing its injured fist to rapidly heal.

“What’s the point of summoning a defeated opponent? No matter how many times you summon it, it will be suicide,” said Moses.

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he continued the summoning. Truth Listener was summoned and it shattered two earrings. It descended like a ferocious beast and glared at Moses.

“Another Strength-type Companion Beast? It doesn’t matter. Attack together.” Moses didn’t care.

Zhou Wen continued summoning and summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and Torch Dragon. One bull and one dragon surrounded Moses.

“That’s... Torch Dragon... That’s Torch Dragon from the Zhuolu temple...” Charlie recognized Torch Dragon and his expression changed drastically.

Moses didn’t look too good either. Zhou Wen had actually summoned five Mythical Companion Beasts alone. This was very rare among the six families.

“No matter how many Companion Beasts you summon, it makes no difference for Giant God Sovereign. If you don’t break through my defense, you will ultimately be defeated.” Although Moses said that, he was no longer confident.

Zhou Wen ignored him and continued summoning his Companion Beasts.

The Golden Overlord Sword and Golden Battle God Halberd appeared beside him, floating in the air. At the same time, the Mythical Kun Dragon and Zhen Dragon appeared. The two black dragons also joined the battlefield as Moses was surrounded in the center.

“That’s... the Golden Battle God Temple of the Metalwork Temple, the black dragon in the Zhuolu underground sea... How is that possible... How can he have so many Mythical Companion Beasts...” Charlie’s voice was trembling. He had never seen a person have so many Mythical Companion Beasts.

Even in recent years, the six families had many more Mythical Companion Beasts than before, but it was already not bad for the core upper echelons to have one. Only top figures could have two or three Mythical Companion Beasts. Those who had five or six Mythical Companion Beasts were considered the family’s top combat strength, the true pillar of the family.

Now, Zhou Wen had summoned more than ten Mythical Companion Beasts alone. Furthermore, they included top-notch terrifying existences like Tyrant Behemoth and Torch Dragon. How could Charlie not be alarmed? Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

At that moment, Moses’s mind was filled with curses. He never expected that Zhou Wen, who wasn’t even a direct descendant of the An family, would have so many Mythical pets on him. Mythical Companion Beasts were summoned out as though they were nothing.

Moses was already regretting it. Although Giant God Sovereign’s strength was powerful and his defense was almost invincible, who could guarantee that none of Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts could restrain him?

According to what Moses knew, Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World’s power could devour all living beings. Giant God Sovereign might not be able to withstand it.

“It’s useless. No matter how many Companion Beasts you have, it’s ultimately a joke if you can’t break through Giant God Sovereign’s defense.” Moses’ tone was no longer as confident as before.

“Is that so?” Zhou Wen finally spoke. At the same time, he summoned two Companion Beasts. Charlie and Moses didn’t recognize the two Companion Beasts, but from the looks of them, they were undoubtedly at the Mythical stage.

Zhou Wen had summoned Doctor Darkness and Explosive Fiend Man.

“Of course. If you can break through Giant God Sovereign’s defense, why did you need to summon so many Mythical Companion Beasts?” Moses seemed to be speaking to Zhou Wen and himself.

“You will soon know the use of having so many Mythical Companion Beasts.” Zhou Wen waved his hand as the terrifying Mythical Companion Beast army charged at Giant God Sovereign.

When Moses saw so many terrifying Mythical Companion Beasts rush over, he felt his scalp tingle, but he had no choice but to bite the bullet and accept the challenge.

However, how could a single Giant God Sovereign deal with so many Mythical Companion Beasts? Although Tyrant Behemoth and company couldn’t break through Giant God Sovereign’s defense, it didn’t stop them from rushing forward to hold down the armored Moses.

Tyrant Behemoth and Truth Listener each held onto an arm, while the two black dragons each pulled at a leg. Torch Dragon wrapped around its neck and pulled Giant God Sovereign down.

Giant God Sovereign had powerful defense, but in terms of strength, it was inferior to Tyrant Behemoth, much less be able to resist so many Mythical creatures at the same time.

The Great Might Vajra Bull stomped on his chest as the Golden Overlord Sword and Golden Battle God Halberd stabbed at his body. Although they failed to penetrate the barrier, they pressed him firmly to the ground. No matter how he struggled, he couldn’t escape.

Charlie fell to the ground. Moses couldn’t be bothered with him anymore. He stood up and wanted to run, but he saw a scalpel suddenly appear and slice across his throat. Doctor Darkness gracefully walked past him and returned to Zhou Wen’s side without looking back.

Charlie covered his neck in horror, but blood kept gushing out of the gaps between his fingers. His eyes widened as he opened his mouth to say something, but all he spat out was blood.

Plop!

Charlie’s body fell to the ground; he was dead.

“What a pity,” Zhou Wen said indifferently when he saw that the Dead Man Tree didn’t react.

“Zhou Wen, it’s useless no matter how many Mythical Companion Beasts you have. You can’t break through my defense. You can’t injure me.” Moses was pressed to the ground by so many Mythical Companion Beasts, but he wasn’t injured. Although he couldn’t move, he still roared.

“Why should I break your defense?” As Zhou Wen spoke, Explosive Fiend Man walked over.

Explosive Fiend Man, whose eye mask was shimmering with an evil glow, pressed its palm on Giant God Sovereign’s barrier, leaving strange marks on it that gradually covered every corner of the barrier.

The Time Bomb skill could only be used on objects that could not resist. It was basically impossible to use it on a Guardian like Giant God Sovereign. However, Giant God Sovereign couldn’t even move.

“What are you trying to do?” Moses’s face was pale, and his eyes were filled with fear. Although he did not know what those imprints did, he knew that things weren’t looking good.

“It’s nothing. I’m just in a good mood and want to set off fireworks to celebrate,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“Let go of me... You bastard...” Moses struggled with all his might. He already felt that something was amiss. Even Giant God Sovereign was struggling to escape as though he was terrified.

However, it was useless. Under the suppression of so many terrifying Mythical creatures, even the Guardian—Giant God Sovereign—couldn’t escape.

After all, it had only broken out of its cocoon not long ago. Although it was strong, it wasn’t capable of Terror transformation and didn’t have overwhelming strength.

More and more imprints appeared on the golden barrier, emitting a dangerous purple glow. It was like a spiderweb that covered the entire barrier.

Finally, Zhou Wen unsummoned all his Companion Beasts and quickly retreated.

“No...” Moses finally regained his freedom. His first reaction was to remove the armor, but it was too late.

Explosive Fiend Man snapped his fingers and there was a bang.

Like a hydrogen bomb exploding, a golden sun rapidly expanded its radius with Moses at the center. Everything that was devoured instantly turned to ashes.
