Chapter 1773 White Jade Pillar

“Eventually, someone saved the rabbits and reared the wolf. From then on, the world was beautiful,” Grim Demon said sarcastically.

“That’s it?” Zhou Wen felt that the story wasn’t over. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Of course not. A wolf is ultimately a wolf, not a dog, but that’s not the most terrifying thing. Sometimes, rabbits might not really be rabbits. That’s what’s most terrifying,” Grim Demon said with a sneer.

“It’s best if you finish your story.” Zhou Wen had roughly noticed something.

“I’m done. You should be able to guess what will happen next,” Grim Demon said as he glanced at Demonic Neonate.

“Who’s the rabbit?” Zhou Wen had guessed that the Gods were likely the wolf. As for Demonic Neonate, or rather, a race that Demonic Neonate represented, they were hunters. As for the rabbit, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure.

“What do you think?” Grim Demon asked.

“Immortals?” Zhou Wen guessed, but he wasn’t sure.

“They look as cute as rabbits, but in fact, they are even more terrifying than wolves.” Grim Demon didn’t say it out loud, but it was already considered tacit agreement.

After a pause, Grim Demon continued, “Now, you should understand why I repeatedly emphasized that we mustn’t let Master be exposed, right?” “I understand, but she’s already exposed. Furthermore, I’m still trapped in the dimension and can’t leave. Do you think the Immortals will come here?” Zhou Wen probed.

In fact, it wasn’t that he didn’t have the ability to leave the dimension. If the Cube didn’t send him back, he could return himself.

Others might not be able to do it, but Zhou Wen, who had the Mystic Thearch Companion Beast, could easily break through the spatial barrier. It wasn’t difficult to return. He only wanted to obtain more information regarding Demonic Neonate from Grim Demon.

Now, he finally knew Demonic Neonate’s origins. It was even bigger than Zhou Wen had imagined. Demonic Neonate or the race that Demonic Neonate belonged to was originally an existence that could suppress the Immortals and Gods.

“Perhaps, perhaps not. The Immortals are no longer the original Immortals. That rebellious Immortal is no longer in the world. With what Master has become, perhaps no Immortal can recognize her,” Grim Demon said after some thought. “However, it’s best you leave immediately. It’s better to be safe than sorry.”

“Do you think this thing can fight an Immortal powerhouse?” Zhou Wen said as he shook the golden trident in his hand.

“It’s hard to say. If the traitor from back then is still around, this thing wouldn’t pose any threat to her. Otherwise, the Gods wouldn’t have been in oblivion for so long. If she’s not around, this thing might still be able to scare those fellows,” Grim Demon said.

“Huh?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.

“What else do you want? Although I’ve been away from the dimension for a long time and don’t know much about the Immortals’ present strength, for them to be capable of suppressing the six Holy races again, it’s impossible for there to be only one person at the Apocalypse grade in the race. You aren’t at the Apocalypse grade yourself. It’s not easy to resist an Apocalypse grade with the help of this thing. Do you want to fight a group alone?” Grim Demon quipped.

“That’s true. In that case, let’s return.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he ignored Grim Demon’s expression and unsummoned Demonic Neonate.

As Demonic Neonate’s weapon, Grim Demon was stored away in the Demonic Sword.

Damn bastard, you will be struck by lightning sooner or later. Grim Demon realized that he had been tricked by Zhou Wen as he cursed inwardly.

Zhou Wen naturally couldn’t hear his curse. Even if he could hear it, he wouldn’t take it to heart.

Summoning Mystic Thearch to possess him in his soul form, he used the spatial teleportation power of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art and instantly returned to Earth.

Without Mystic Thearch’s power, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art couldn’t break through the spatial barrier. It could only teleport in the dimension, so it was impossible for him to return to Earth.

Not long after Zhou Wen returned to Earth, a terrifying existence tore through the air and descended on the divine mountain. However, there was only an empty mountain left. The terrifying existence scanned the area for a long time but didn’t discover anything.

If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have been so apprehensive. A human punk actually obtained the golden Three-Eyed God. The terrifying existence frowned slightly. He stared at the divine mountain for a moment before turning around and disappearing.

Several extremely terrifying existences descended on the divine mountain in a row, but when they saw the empty divine mountain, no one was interested in staying any longer. They only felt a little regretful.

After a long time, another terrifying creature arrived at the divine mountain. Furthermore, more than one came.

It was a woman who looked like a fairy. The clouds beneath her feet landed on the divine mountain. At the same time, she flicked her sleeve and something flew out.

When the thing flew out of her sleeve, it looked the size of a pellet, but when it landed in front of the temple, it turned into a huge white jade pillar.

The white jade pillar was erected in front of the temple’s door. It was almost as tall as the huge temple as though it was rooted there. And on the white jade pillar, there were black metal chains wrapped around it. Every metal chain passed through a human man’s body and firmly bound him to the white jade pillar.

“Old Zhou, you’ve really struck it rich this time. I’m afraid everyone in the Federation knows your name, Zhou Wen,” Li Xuan exclaimed excitedly when he saw Zhou Wen return.

“It’s not like I wanted to be that famous; it’s just that my strength doesn’t allow it,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“You actually took the compliment?” Li Xuan punched Zhou Wen and cursed him in amusement.

“That’s only because I deserve the compliment.” Zhou Wen turned to look at Trajectory Seeking and said, “My dear disciple, do you think I have the right to teach you now?”

“Yes.” Trajectory Seeking surprisingly nodded in response. Her attitude was completely different from before.

Back when Zhou Wen repelled the will of Nameless God, Trajectory Seeking could still console herself, believing that it was the influence of Earth’s rules that prevented Nameless God from remotely unleashing his true strength.

However, Zhou Wen was now able to make the golden Three-Eyed God willingly make a Covenant of God. This was a manifestation of absolute strength.

Even an existence like the golden Three-Eyed God was willing to be Zhou Wen’s weapon. There was nothing shameful about her being Zhou Wen’s disciple.

Seeing that Trajectory Seeking’s beliefs had wavered, Zhou Wen was about to say something when he saw the Cube suddenly light up.

Another person is attempting the level? Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He had already taken away something valuable from the Tomb of the Fallen Gods. He didn’t understand why the Cube was continuing the battle. The person clearing the level wasn’t a human, but a strange beast that looked like a lion but was made of bronze.

Unlike before, no scene of the Lake of Fog appeared again. The bronze lion appeared at the foot of the divine mountain.

It moved its four hooves as wind and fire rose beneath its feet. In a moment, it ran to the peak of the divine mountain.

To everyone’s surprise, there were already two people on the empty peak of the divine mountain.

One was a beautiful woman, while the other was an extremely handsome man with dragon horns on his head and white hair that resembled ice threads. The man was tied to a white jade pillar with chains piercing through his sternum. One could feel the pain just looking at him.

“Teacher!” Zhou Wen immediately trembled when he saw the man’s appearance.
