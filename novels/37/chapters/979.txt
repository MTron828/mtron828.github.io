Chapter 980: Myriad Sword Resonance

Translator: CKtalon

“If it’s possible, please let me take a look.” Zhou Wen felt that he really needed to change his train of thought. Otherwise, he would only walk into a dead end if he just continued doing the same.

Miya thought for a moment and said, “I’m a Golden Dragon. All my powers are obtained through inheritance. I only know one concept, and that is Golden Dragon King Battle Intent.”

“Battle Intent? How is it different from ordinary concepts?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I’m not sure either. Have a feel of it yourself,” Miya said as she pressed a hand to Zhou Wen’s forehead.

Zhou Wen didn’t dodge and allowed Miya’s palm to press on his forehead. As he didn’t dare cause too much of a stir in the Seven Seas Dragon King’s body, Miya directly imprinted her Golden Dragon King Battle Intent into Zhou Wen’s mind, allowing him to sense her battle intent.

At that instant, Zhou Wen seemed to see an extremely terrifying Golden Dragon King appear in the world. It was ferocious and domineering, as though it was the overlord of the entire world. The terrifying battle intent made all life tremble.

It was a primordial era. Lightning, fires, floods, and all sorts of calamities frequently descended. All sorts of creatures died in the calamity. Only creatures with extremely powerful vitality could survive in such primordial times.

The Golden Dragon King grew in such an environment. At the same time, due to the extinction of all things, food became extremely scarce. All sorts of terrifying creatures could only fight each other and eat each other’s flesh and blood.

Combat! Crazy combat! One could only survive through combat.

The Golden Dragon King might not be the most powerful beast, nor was it the beast with the strongest defense, much less the fastest beast.

However, through constant combat, the Golden Dragon King rapidly grew. It constantly transformed and evolved in battle, eventually allowing it to stand at the top of the food chain.

The unyielding, fearless, brave, crazy, and intelligent will left even Zhou Wen, who was a spectator, deeply shocked.

Zhou Wen knew that this was the inherited memories of the Golden Dragons. The Golden Dragon King in the Battle Intent was actually the first generation Golden Dragon King. It probably didn’t exist in the world anymore.

However, its fearless battle intent was eternal.

There’s no such thing as having good fortune after surviving a great calamity in this world. It’s just that I obtained enough insight and growth in a great calamity to improve myself. Zhou Wen came to a realization as though he understood why his sword art had yet to make a breakthrough.

It wasn’t because he didn’t practice well enough, nor was it because his comprehension was lacking, nor was it because he wasn’t diligent enough.

It was because no matter how much Zhou Wen cultivated, he was ultimately learning something from others. He was learning the three thousand sword intents without comprehending something that belonged to him in battle.

This also had something to do with Zhou Wen’s views. He hadn’t planned on practicing sword arts to begin with. He had only learned sword arts to advance Sword Pill, so naturally, he just needed to master it. He hadn’t planned on improving it further.

Zhou Wen now realized that he had underestimated sword arts. Everything in the world had its own principles. If he didn’t put his heart into it, no matter how smart he was, it would be difficult for him to reach the extreme.

Only then did Zhou Wen realize that he hadn’t lost to the sword art, but to himself.

Indeed, one needs to put their heart in everything they do. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but think hard.

“I hope my Battle Intent can help you,” Miya said as she retracted her hand when she saw that Zhou Wen had escaped the influence of her Battle Intent.

“Thank you so much. It was very useful. You’ve helped me greatly.” Zhou Wen thanked her sincerely.

If Miya hadn’t shown him the Golden Dragon King Battle Intent, he wouldn’t have realized his problems. It was easy for animals like humans to discover the problems of others, but it was the hardest to discover their own problems.

After figuring all of this out, Zhou Wen felt a sense of clarity. When he thought about the 3,000 sword intents again, he immediately felt different. It was as though he was observing the 3,000 sword intents from a different angle and discovered many things that he hadn’t noticed before.

Miya looked at Zhou Wen and suddenly realized that his aura had changed. It was ethereal and illusory in a rather surreal fashion.

Although Zhou Wen was standing in front of her, she felt that he resembled a virtual projection. He didn’t give of the feeling that he was an existence made of flesh and blood.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen’s presence continued to decrease. If she closed her eyes, she wouldn’t even be able to sense him standing in front of her.

“What... did you do...” Miya looked at Zhou Wen in a daze, not daring to take her eyes off him. It was as though Zhou Wen would vanish if she didn’t keep her eyes on him.

“It’s nothing. I just gained some insight after seeing your Golden Dragon King Battle Intent,” Zhou Wen said.

Miya’s expression turned even odder. She really didn’t understand what Zhou Wen’s performance had to do with the Golden Dragon King Battle Intent.

If Zhou Wen’s battle intent surged like the reincarnation of a Tyrannosaurus, Miya would believe that it was something he had comprehended from the Golden Dragon King Battle Intent.

However, Zhou Wen’s presence was getting weaker and weaker. This was completely at odds with the Golden Dragon King Battle Intent. Miya couldn’t understand how Zhou Wen connected the two and comprehended such things.

Are humans... all so strange? Miya was secretly puzzled.

Zhou Wen didn’t explain further because some things couldn’t be explained with words. After sitting down, he took out his phone and entered the game again.

When he arrived at the Ancient Sword Tomb again, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to use his sword. He walked to a sword tomb and reached to pull out the sword.

After the ancient sword was pulled out, it immediately struggled amidst Zhou Wen’s palm and flew into the air, prepared to attack.

However, the ancient sword spun a few times in midair as though it couldn’t see Zhou Wen. It didn’t attack him.

Zhou Wen ignored it and walked to another sword tomb, pulling out the ancient sword from it.

The outcome was the same. The ancient sword streaked across the sky as though it couldn’t see Zhou Wen. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Zhou Wen pulled out swords as he walked. He pulled out hundreds of ancient swords of different levels and attributes, but none of them attacked him as though he wasn’t the one pulling them out.

At that moment, Zhou Wen finally moved. With a tap of his finger, the resplendent Sword Pill tore through the air and streaked across the sky. More than a hundred ancient swords were instantly sliced apart by Sword Pill. Not a single sword could withstand a single strike from Sword Pill. The remnant sword fragments fell to the ground, leaving only Sword Pill floating in front of Zhou Wen. Above Zhou Wen and Sword Pill was an extremely terrifying sword intent.

Hum!

Inside the Sword Tomb, the myriad swords resonated.
