Chapter 1250: Practice Method

Although the bullets shot by the Golden Battle God were very fast and powerful, they had different attributes.

However, such attacks didn’t pose much of a threat to Zhou Wen. His reaction and speed could keep up with the bullet’s speed, so after practicing for a while, Zhou Wen knew that there was no point in continuing. There wouldn’t be any improvement.

After using the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords to block all sorts of bullets, he was very certain that the sword was hard. When bullets of different attributes hit the ancient sword, even the scabbard wasn’t damaged.

From the looks of it, I can only get an effect by receiving the Calamity-grade bullets. Otherwise, it would be a waste of effort no matter how much I train. After thinking through everything, Zhou Wen killed the Golden Battle Gods one by one, prepared to see if he could block the Calamity-grade bullet.

Now, Zhou Wen really wished that he had the Eye of Odin. That way, he could have recorded the firing process and slowly replayed it.

Unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t have that ability, so he had to figure it out during the process.

Zhou Wen had already tried quite a number of times, but he was killed every time. None of it was an accident. Not only could he not block it, but he couldn’t even keep up with its speed. He couldn’t even dodge.

Now that he had the tough Son of Heaven’s Three Swords, he should be able to block it, but it was a problem if he could get the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords to make contact with the bullet.

Under normal circumstances, it was impossible to touch it, but Zhou Wen didn’t plan on giving up. Before finishing off the last Golden Battle God, Zhou Wen summoned his Terror-grade Companion Beasts.

After Banana Fairy, the three Golden Battle Gods, Deva Asura, and Grim Reaper No. 10 were summoned, Zhou Wen started carving marks.

Terror power immediately surged through Zhou Wen. No, to be precise, it surged into the armor formed by the Limitless Demon Dragon King.

The black crystal-like armor emitted a terrifying glow due to the immense energy. It was as though the black crystal was burning.

The Limitless Demon Dragon King’s functions played a role, sharing their powers with Zhou Wen. Now, he had an additional six Terror-grade powers. Together with his Terror transformation powers, Zhou Wen now grasped unprecedented power.

With this power, Zhou Wen held the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords tightly and welcomed the Calamity-grade bullets.

Bang!

Although Zhou Wen’s reaction was very fast, the shot blasted his head apart before he could swing his sword.

Furthermore, because the Dragon King armor had gathered immense strength, the Calamity creature treated him as its first target. After one shot, nothing was left.

It still doesn’t work? Zhou Wen deeply understood the difference between a Calamity and a Terror-grade existence.

He had obtained the augmentation of six Terror-grade powers, but he couldn’t even block an ordinary bullet, much less the sure-kill seventh bullet.

However, it wasn’t as though Zhou Wen had gained nothing. With the augmentation of powerful strength and the enhancement of Great Brahma and Human Sovereign’s perception, Zhou Wen could roughly see the trajectory of the bullet, but he couldn’t dodge it.

Strange. Previously, when I used the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords to block the bullet for Tsukuyomi, I could clearly do it. Why don’t I have time to block an ordinary bullet for myself? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and understood why he couldn’t block it.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Previously, helping Tsukuyomi block the bullet was actually a form of prediction. When he saw the bullet turn, he had already predicted that the bullet would shoot towards the back of Tsukuyomi’s head. Therefore, he could throw the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords ahead of time.

However, when it was his turn to block the bullet, although he knew that the bullet would definitely shoot at him, he didn’t know where it would go. The Son of Heaven’s Three Swords couldn’t block his entire body. Without any predictions, it was impossible for him to block a Calamity-grade bullet by relying on reaction alone.

The Limitless Demon Dragon King armor allows me to draw upon the powers of eight creatures. This time, I only used six. I’ll try getting eight next time. Perhaps I can block it then. Zhou Wen was considering what Companion Beasts to use.

As Zhou Wen grinded the dungeons, he thought about the trajectory of the bullet he had seen today, as well as his prediction when helping Tsukuyomi block the bullet.

That bullet appears and disappears unpredictably. I can’t even see the shooter, making it difficult to predict the trajectory. Is there no way to predict the trajectory of the bullet without seeing the shooter? Zhou Wen practiced in-game as he thought.

“Young Master Wen, what are you doing?” When An Sheng came to find Zhou Wen, he saw him gesturing with his bare hands. He did not know what he was doing, so he asked.

“I’m practicing my swordplay,” Zhou Wen said.

“How can you train like that? What’s the point of gesturing with your fingers? How can it compare with real weapon practice?” An Sheng said.

“I also want to practice with something real, but no one has such a fast attack speed that can pressure me.” Zhou Wen was telling the truth, but it sounded arrogant to others.

An Sheng understood Zhou Wen’s character and knew that he wasn’t an arrogant person. He asked in puzzlement, “How fast do you want it?”

“It’s about the same as the bullet fired by the Calamity-grade creature in the Venusian dimensional zone,” Zhou Wen said casually. He didn’t believe that An Sheng could help him find a Calamity-grade sparring partner.

“You only want speed, and have no other requirements on strength?” An Sheng asked again.

“No, as long as it’s fast enough. However, with such speed, it’s definitely at the Calamity grade. It’s impossible for creatures below the Calamity grade to have such speed,” Zhou Wen said.

“There’s no need to use humans for this matter. Just machines can resolve it. Humans definitely can’t reach such speeds, but machines can. If you only need speed and not strength or other requirements, you don’t need complicated machinery. Just a torchlight will do,” An Sheng said.

Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “I’ve thought of that as well. The speed of light is naturally fast, but it’s impossible for the person using the flashlight to be that fast. As long as I see him use a flashlight to illuminate me, I can easily dodge the beam from determining his actions.”

“There’s a model of the compressed accelerator in the military laboratory. Although it’s a model, the principle is the same as the real deal. As long as you input the procedure properly ahead of time, it will shoot out light according to that procedure. You can’t tell what the machine is doing, right?” An Sheng said.

“Is it convenient for you to lend me that thing?” After Zhou Wen listened to An Sheng’s detailed description of the model’s principle, he felt that this method might really work.

He followed An Sheng to the military laboratory of the Sunset Army and began a new round of practice.
