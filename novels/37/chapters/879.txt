Chapter 880: Transferring the Baby Tiger

Translator: CKtalon

It was somewhat different from the first ranking battle. The ranking had just started not long ago. In less than an hour, all sorts of pets filled the rankings. Many Companion Beasts on the rankings had been seen in the previous ranking battle.

However, Primordial Sword Immortal and Fairy Immortal Gu, who had performed extremely well the last time, weren’t on the rankings. Zhou Wen’s Tyrant Behemoth naturally wasn’t on the rankings.

The person ranked first was still Great Skyfiend. No matter which Companion Beasts appeared on the rankings, they couldn’t shake his position.

This was also within Zhou Wen’s expectations. Great Skyfiend wasn’t just referring to a Guardian. There was also the human who had fused with him, as well as various Companion Beasts that the human had. Their combined combat strength far exceeded a single Companion Beast.

Unless there was someone else who had similarly contracted a Guardian on the rankings, in terms of overall combat strength, it was almost impossible for ordinary Companion Beasts to surpass Great Skyfiend.

Various areas of the Federation were also discussing what Great Skyfiend was. Most humans didn’t know of the existence of Guardians, but anyone could tell that Great Skyfiend didn’t look like a Companion Beast.

...

Zhou Wen didn’t dare stay in one place for too long. After staying for a night, he left the city.

It’s already the fourth day. Even if that alchemist comes out, he shouldn’t be able to find me, Zhou Wen thought as he walked. Suddenly, he was taken aback as his expression turned odd.

My first thought is that I’m actually worried about that alchemist and not Jing Daoxian. This is too dangerous. Now, Zhou Wen suddenly understood why Lord Alcohol and Xia Jiuhuang believed in Jing Daoxian, who was known as a devil.

This person was a very complicated contradiction to begin with. He did whatever he wanted and killed people without a care. But sometimes, he had a charm that made it obvious that he was evil, but it was impossible to associate him with the word evil.

Zhou Wen was alarmed. He knew that such a thought was very dangerous. He needed to be more alert. Jing Daoxian was even more dangerous than the old alchemist.

Ding!

As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, a pleasant chime sounded in-game.

Looking down, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be overjoyed. A baby tiger had dropped in-game.

Finally, another baby tiger has spawned. Zhou Wen looked at its stats. It wasn’t much different from the two baby tigers from before.

“What should I combine the baby tiger with?” As the baby tiger’s luck couldn’t be stacked, it could only be used for fusion.

However, with the lesson learned from the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Zhou Wen didn’t dare randomly fuse it. He first matched the baby tiger with his various Companion Beasts to check their compatibility.

There were quite a number of Companion Beasts with high compatibility, but Zhou Wen didn’t immediately decide on fusing them.

I’ll put it aside for now. Zhou Wen decided to consider it later. After all, getting the baby tiger to drop was just too difficult.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen thought of the method he had learned from Liu Yun. He thought to himself, It’s fine if I don’t fuse the baby tiger. I can try transferring it, but who should I transfer it to?

Now, there was only Ya’er beside Zhou Wen, but it was still difficult to say if Ya’er was considered a living person. He didn’t know if she could use Companion Beasts like ordinary people.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to ask her, “Ya’er, can you use Companion Beasts?”

Ya’er looked at Zhou Wen blankly. Clearly, she didn’t know either.

“Let’s do this. Let’s give it a try.” Zhou Wen decided to head to the city to buy a Mortal Companion Egg for Ya’er to see if she could hatch it.

If she could incubate and use Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen could give her some Companion Beasts that he didn’t need. While giving her the ability to protect herself, she could also control the Companion Beasts to help him.

After arriving in the city, Zhou Wen found a Companion Egg shop and bought the weakest Mortal Companion Egg. It was much more expensive than Legendary Companion Eggs.

The reason he chose the weakest was that Zhou Wen was afraid that incubating a Companion Egg would require too much Essence Energy and Ya’er’s body wouldn’t be able to withstand it.

Although she had divine-level mental strength, her body was still that of a child. If her body lacked the Essence Energy needed, something bad might happen.

“Try injecting your Essence Energy into the Companion Egg.” Zhou Wen handed the Companion Egg to Ya’er.

“Do you know what Essence Energy is?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment before asking her. As Ya’er was a Kuman Nee in the past, he didn’t know if she cultivated in Essence Energy Arts.

Ya’er nodded and took the Companion Egg. Soon, the Companion Egg in her hand hatched and transformed into a stream of light that transformed into a tattoo on Ya’er’s body.

So she can really use Companion Beasts! Zhou Wen thought for a moment. He wanted to first transfer the baby tiger to Ya’er. He wanted her to be luckier and passively increase his luck. After all, Ya’er would always be with him.

He successfully transferred the baby tiger to Ya’er, and Zhou Wen had only sacrificed a star in the Pocket Universe.

Furthermore, with the evolution of the Pocket Universe, that star could still be reborn in the future.

This Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art is really awesome. With this Essence Energy Art, won’t I be able to exchange Companion Beasts? Unfortunately, not everyone knows the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art. Otherwise, I could exchange Companion Beasts at will. Zhou Wen marveled inwardly as he increasingly liked this Essence Energy Art.

Zhou Wen transferred a few Companion Beasts to Ya’er before telling her how to use their abilities.

Ya’er was very smart. As long as Zhou Wen told her what to do, she could use them perfectly without making any mistakes.

“Ya’er, you’re really smart.” Zhou Wen stroked Ya’er’s head. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Zhou Wen took a huge detour and when they arrived at a city again, the first on the ranking was still Great Skyfiend. Apart from Great Skyfiend, no other Guardian had entered the rankings.

There shouldn’t only be one Guardian. At the very least, Jiang Yan has Burial Immortal. Why didn’t he participate in the battle? Zhou Wen was puzzled.

However, he realized that the ranking battle had only recently started. There was still plenty of time. It was also possible that some Guardians wanted to secretly hide their strength and hadn’t chosen to fight.

From the looks of it, the Battle of Guardians is about to officially surface. Zhou Wen continued on his journey with Ya’er. After walking so much and going to so many unfamiliar places, Glimmer’s evolution speed remained stagnant. Although it kept improving, its progress was rather slow.

Zhou Wen headed north, planning on heading to the North District where the Ultimate Family Clan was. There were many dimensional creatures he had never seen before, as well as many novel dungeons. Since he had to walk around, he might as well download some new dungeons.

However, before he could even walk out of the East District, Zhou Wen saw an elder slowly walking over from the opposite side on a flat road.

Although he was still a distance away from the elder, Zhou Wen had already identified the elder as the alchemist in the Founding Emperor Tomb. Not only had he got out, but he had also found Zhou Wen after so many days.
