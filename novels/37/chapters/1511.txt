Chapter 1512 Drawing A Circle

“He actually has such a powerful Calamity-grade Companion Beast?” Chess Immortal said in surprise.

“There’s nothing strange about that. Earth is rapidly changing. Humans have already found a way to break through to the Mythical stage. It’s not impossible for top humans to obtain a Calamity Companion Beast,” Berserker Immortal said indifferently.

“Your Excellency, are we still going to other dimensional zones to lure dimensional creatures over?” Painting Immortal pondered.

“There’s no need. We aren’t familiar with the other dimensional zones, so we might not be able to lure the dimensional creatures out. Besides, we don’t have that much time. It’s best we meet Zhou Wen directly.” Berserker Immortal glanced at Zhou Wen in the distant sky and slowly walked towards the stairs.

Zhou Wen placed the white snake down and quickly realized that there was a Companion Egg and a dimensional crystal in its body.

The Companion Egg was obviously the white snake’s Companion Egg. As for the dimensional crystal, it was crystalline like a dragon pearl with a white snake shadow swirling inside-a skill crystal.

Zhou Wen grabbed the Companion Egg and dimensional crystal, but the Companion Egg was a little too big. It was half the height of a person and was crystalline like white jade.

Zhou Wen took out his phone to see what attributes the white snake Companion Beast had.

Although it had been sliced apart by the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ Clean Break, it was a Calamity-grade Companion Beast after all. Its skills hadn’t seemed strong when fighting the Golden Wyrm Scissors, but that didn’t mean that it wasn’t strong. There weren’t any useless Companion Beasts; their potential was fully dependent on the user. Therefore, Zhou Wen placed great importance on this Companion Beast.

Before taking out his phone, Zhou Wen suddenly frowned slightly and turned to look in a direction.

Five people came from afar. They walked in the crowd and didn’t look too conspicuous, nor did they have any special auras.

However, for some reason, the people in front of them would subconsciously make way for them as though this was how it should be.

Are these fellows human? Zhou Wen carefully observed them and didn’t discover any dimensional creature auras on them. They looked like humans.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t hear their heartbeats. How could humans not have a heartbeat?

Zhou Wen realized that the arrival of the ghosts and the white snake might not be as simple as a break-out of an ordinary dimensional zone.

“Old Zhou, what’s wrong?” Li Xuan saw that Zhou Wen’s expression wasn’t right. He traced his gaze and saw Berserker Immortal and company.

Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu also walked over. Clearly, they had also sensed the abnormality of the five of them.

This was because even the soldiers in charge of guarding the area subconsciously made way and didn’t stop the five of them.

“What’s their background?” Li Xuan looked at Berserker Immortal and company and whispered to Zhou Wen.

“I don’t know.” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly.

Berserker Immortal and company came nearby just as Li Xuan was about to say something

“Who are you?” Li Xuan stared at them and shouted.

Berserker Immortal ignored Li Xuan and walked to Zhou Wen. He stopped and looked at him. “I have good news and bad news for you. Which one do you want to hear first?”

“Good news. I don’t like tragedies,” Zhou Wen said.

“I can help you clear Dubhe’s dimensional zone and enter the Cube’s rankings to take first place,” said Berserker Immortal seriously. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Who do you think you are? Even Immortal from the League of Guardians wouldn’t dare say such things in front of us brothers,” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.

“Immortal? He’s nothing. As long as you are willing to cooperate with me, Immortal can only bow before you,” said Berserker Immortal.

“Do whatever you need to do. We don’t have time to listen to your nonsense.” Li Xuan naturally didn’t believe it. Apart from Human Sovereign, the publicly recognized strongest faction on Earth was the League of Guardians.

As for the Holy Land’s strength, no one knew.

“What’s the bad news?” Zhou Wen asked again.

Berserker Immortal said, “The bad news is that you will have to spend more time thinking about how to manage Earth’s Federation in the future.”

“That’s interesting. How may I address you?” Zhou Wen narrowed his eyes and asked Berserker Immortal.

Although Berserker Immortal didn’t emit any aura and looked like an ordinary person, Zhou Wen sensed extreme danger from him.

“You don’t need to know who I am. All you need to know is what I can give you,” said Berserker Immortal.

Li Xuan was amused as he walked over and patted Berserker Immortal on the shoulder. “Brother, you sure are good at bragging. Did you not ask around who us brothers are before you came? There’s no one on Earth who can brag in front of us brothers. Go do whatever you need to do.”

When the four immortals saw Li Xuan patting Berserker Immortal’s shoulder, they were immediately enraged. Just as they were about to attack, they were stopped by Berserker Immortal with a wave of his hand.

“I know you are considered top figures in the Federation. I’m afraid I won’t be able to convince you without showing some feats.” Berserker Immortal gestured at Painting Immortal.

Painting Immortal tacitly understood and walked in front of Zhou Wen and summoned a brush. Then, he drew a circle on the ground. He stood in the circle and looked at Zhou Wen. “I’ll stand here motionless. You can try your best to see if you can injure me.”

Others might not understand, but Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised when he saw the circle drawn by Painting Immortal.

The circle drawn by Painting Immortal was actually similar to his Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. They were both periodic spatial skills.

The circle drawn by Painting Immortal was static. It borrowed the space on the ground and was far inferior dynamically to Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.

It could be said that the skill Painting Immortal used was actually one level lower than Zhou Wen’s.

“Zhou Wen, wasn’t your Companion Beast quite powerful? You can try to see if it can injure me.” Painting Immortal stood in the circle with his hands behind his back. He looked like a sage as though he didn’t take Zhou Wen seriously.

Zhou Wen naturally knew that a weapon like the Golden Wyrm Scissors was useless against such periodic spatial skills. Even if he released the Golden Wyrm Scissors, it would only circle around the ring and not injure the Painting Immortal inside.

Of course, Zhou Wen was good at such skills. It wasn’t difficult to crack Painting Immortal’s skill.

“Why? Don’t you dare?” Painting Immortal provoked Zhou Wen smugly when he saw him remain motionless.

“Coach, this level of competition isn’t worth you personally taking action. Let me do it.” Feng Qiuyan suddenly stood forward, hoping to request permission to fight. The Immortals didn’t think much of humans to begin with. Even Zhou Wen was only of value to them because he had been born on Earth. Without eyeing Zhou Wen, would they even think anything of Feng Qiuyan?

Since Feng Qiuyan addressed Zhou Wen as Coach, he was clearly a student taught by Zhou Wen. How could Painting Immortal take a fancy to him?

“Young man, this isn’t playing house. It will kill you,” Painting Immortal said coldly.

“Give it a try.” Zhou Wen saw the determination in Feng Qiuyan’s eyes as though he was very confident, so he nodded in agreement.
