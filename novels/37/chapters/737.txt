“Did you read it carefully? This isn’t an ordinary challenge. We have to fight until one person falls,” Xia Liuchuan reminded him.

“I’ve read it carefully. I can agree to a life-and-death duel with you, but on one condition. The location of the duel has to be chosen by me,” Zhou Wen said.

“Don’t tell me you want to have the duel in Luoyang?” Xia Liuchuan said with a smile.

Xia Liuchuan would have done such a thing himself. If Zhou Wen also did the same, Xia Liuchuan could have agreed if he had any say. However, he had no choice in this duel. He couldn’t agree to Zhou Wen’s request.

“No, it’s in the Imperial Capital,” Zhou Wen said.

“Where do you want it to happen?” Xia Liuchuan asked.

To be able to fight an expert like you can be considered a boon in life. I probably won’t have many opportunities like this in life, so I naturally have to choose a place that matches you and me. How about we fight at the peak of Forbidden City? Just as Zhou Wen was worrying about how he could enter the Forbidden City, Xia Liuchuan came knocking on his door.

Zhou Wen didn’t care about life-and-death duels at all. As long as he could settle the crappy piece of wood, he would immediately put on the Invisibility Cloak and leave. It didn’t matter if he won.

“This...” Xia Liuchuan was in a difficult position.

It was fine to have the duel elsewhere, but Forbidden City was under the Old Master’s control. Without the Old Master’s orders, even the Xia family members couldn’t enter.

“What? Are you still worried when it’s your Xia family’s territory?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Alright, I promise you. Since you decided on the location, I’ll decide on the time,” Xia Liuchuan said.

“Sure. When?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Wait for my news.” Xia Liuchuan turned around and left.

This fellow is really odd. He was clearly the Concerned Person that night. Why isn’t he admitting to it? Zhou Wen was puzzled.

However, as long as nothing unexpected happened, the matter of entering Forbidden City had been resolved by accident. With the opportunity of a duel with Xia Liuchuan, Zhou Wen could try erecting the log at higher spots.

Dealing with Xia Liuchuan was better than dealing with the Xia family’s gank.

While waiting for Xia Liuchuan’s reply, Zhou Wen stayed in his room to grind. He didn’t go anywhere.

Since he had nothing to do, Zhou Wen planned on trying to kill the nine black dragons. He could use Doctor Darkness’s Darkness Right Hand to kill the three black dragons.

After bringing all his Mythical Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen arrived at the underground sea again.

With Behemoth on the left, Truth Listener on the right, Six-Winged on his back, he held a golden sword in his hand. Along with the old bull under his crotch and a Torch Dragon coiled behind him.

Zhou Wen had even summoned the extremely weak Medusa. Perhaps it would be of some use if she stood by the shore to provide support.

Demonic Neonate naturally didn’t need to be mentioned. She had already joined the battle. However, she found a cave beside the underground sea and hid there. She had no intention of participating in the battle head-on.

“Come, my Doctor Darkness.” Zhou Wen summoned his most important Companion Beast and made Doctor Darkness transform into a soul that fused with him.

Zhou Wen immediately felt his physique improve significantly. He was almost comparable to a Mythical stage entity.

This was the benefit of Doctor Darkness. Not only could his Companion Form bestow Zhou Wen with skills, but it could also raise Zhou Wen’s basic stats, allowing him to have the ability to fight against Mythical creatures. This was something no other Companion Beast could do.

Unfortunately, Banana Fairy hasn’t completed her evolution. Otherwise, I would have a greater chance.

Zhou Wen prepared everything and summoned some Poison Bat Companion Beasts to use as bait to lure the nine black dragons over.

In a short while, he saw a huge wave stir above the surface of the sea. Nine black dragons tore through the waves and wiped out the horde of Poison Bats in the blink of an eye.

“Fight, my pets.” After Zhou Wen issued the order, Torch Dragon, Behemoth, and Truth Listener rushed into the sea.

As the Great Might Vajra Bull was afraid of water, it didn’t dare enter the water to fight. On the bank, it transformed into the thousand-armed, bull-headed state. Golden light shot out from its palm as it attacked the nine black dragons. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Torch Dragon didn’t use Bright Torch Vision World. Although using Bright Torch Vision World could instantly kill the black dragons, nothing would be left behind. That would make killing the black dragon useless.

In a one-on-one battle, Torch Dragon was unable to gain the upper hand without using Bright Torch Vision World. It was obvious that the black dragons were top Mythical creatures.

The moment Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength was unleashed, the invisible chains between the nine black dragons produced effects. They condensed the power of the nine dragons and collided with Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength. Tyrant Behemoth immediately fell into a disadvantage.

Truth Listener constantly harassed them from the side, but it didn’t dare clash head-on with the black dragons.

Zhou Wen had been waiting for an opportunity to use Darkness Right Hand. All he needed was for his hand to touch one black dragon.

However, the black dragon’s body was too huge. It was probably unrealistic to pull out its heart with a single palm, so Zhou Wen’s target was their brains.

He didn’t expect to dig out their brains. All he needed to do was stir them up.

Although the nine black dragons were independent Mythical creatures, they were connected by invisible chains. In battle, they were like one. Their attack and defense were flawless. Zhou Wen watched for a while, but he failed to find an opportunity to attack.

These nine black dragons are really difficult to deal with. Zhou Wen activated Doctor Darkness’s Eyes of Penetration to see if there were any weaknesses in the black dragons’ bodies.

If Doctor Darkness hadn’t advanced to the Mythical stage, he wouldn’t have been able to see so far with his Eyes of Penetration. His ability to see through things wasn’t that strong either, so he definitely wouldn’t be able to see through the black dragon’s body. Now, all he needed to do was approach it a little and he could clearly see the situation inside the black dragon’s body.

This glance left Zhou Wen slightly taken aback. In the black dragon’s brain, there was a crystal-like bead with a faint dragon-shaped stream of light swirling inside.

That thing can’t be the legendary dragon pearl, right? Zhou Wen carefully sized up the pearl in the black dragon’s brain and quickly made a new discovery.

The black dragon’s brain had the pearl as its core. Although there were parts similar to the brain, it looked like those parts were just supplementary. It was somewhat different from a human’s brain.

What was even more magical was that when the dragon-shaped stream of light in the dragon pearl circulated, it looked like a word. Zhou Wen carefully identified it as the word “Kan.”

Could it be... Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at the other eight black dragons and indeed, he found a dragon pearl in their heads. However, the words in the dragon pearls were different.

Qian, Kun, Zhen, Xun, Kan, Li, Gen, Dui, and Wu. The nine black dragons’ dragon pearls each had these words. The first eight words were from the Eight Trigrams, and the last word was Wu. Zhou Wen guessed that it represented Wuji—Limitless.
