Chapter 505 Niten Flying Immortal-ryū

"Teacher!" Honn Shinsakura suddenly saw a trickle of blood on Sei Gasakai’s neck. He couldn’t help but be shocked and went to rush over.

"If I were you, I wouldn’t touch him," Zhou Wen said.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Honn Shinsakura’s body trembled. He stood outside the stone pavilion and didn’t rush in. He stared at Zhou Wen and gritted his teeth as he asked, "Your Excellency, since you have already won, why do you have to go so far as to kill him?"

Zhou Wen pointed at Sei Gasakai and said, "I’m not a murderer. Why would I kill him? Your teacher is probably envisaging a battle in his mind. I don’t know what will happen if you disturb him."

Doubtful, Honn Shinsakura looked at Sei Gasakai. Seeing that his teacher was standing there in a daze, his eyes empty, and the wound on his neck only a superficial wound, he heaved a sigh of relief.

"What’s the name of the strike your teacher used just now?" Zhou Wen asked as he looked at Honn Shinsakura.

He now had comprehended the meaning of Will Renewal and life and death thanks to Sei Gasakai’s sword will. He had understood the relationship between humans and nature, which allowed the Dao Body to condense a Life Soul. From this, one could tell that Sei Gasakai’s move was indeed powerful.

Honn Shinsakura didn’t dare belittle Zhou Wen any further. Although there wasn’t much of a difference in age between the two of them, he treated himself as a junior. He cautiously answered, "That move isn’t named. My teacher used the Niten Ichi-ryū as a foundation before comprehending the Four Seasons’ Will Renewal and Life-and-Death Samsara concepts. He then created this blade technique."

"I see." Zhou Wen nodded slightly and got up to leave.

He came to the Peony Garden because he wanted to see if he could condense a Dao Body Life Soul. Although the Peony Garden failed to help him, in a way, Sei Gasakai had helped him.

Zero Taboo (Primordial Body): Union of Heaven and Man, Invulnerable to all Spells

With the appearance of the Life Soul, the word "taboo" behind Essence Energy disappeared.

This was a Life Soul condensed from a Dao Body. It was somewhat odd with being a crystal in his consciousness that seemed to have a corporeal form, but it also seemed incorporeal. It was this Life Soul that had blocked Sei Gasakai’s Will Renewal move. It nullified the powers for Zhou Wen, allowing him to defeat Sei Gasakai.

In terms of pure strength, Sei Gasakai’s Perfect-stage Samsara Sword Sage was much stronger than Zhou Wen’s Life Soul. If he hadn’t used that move and had used ordinary Essence Energy to fight Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen’s strike wouldn’t have been able to win so easily.

Upon seeing Zhou Wen walk out of the stone pavilion, Honn Shinsakura anxiously asked, "How’s my teacher?"

"I didn’t hurt him. It’s just that he doesn’t understand something. He’ll naturally recover once he figures it out," Zhou Wen said without turning his head.

Honn Shinsakura hesitated for a moment. Seeing that Zhou Wen was about to leave, he couldn’t help but shout at Zhou Wen’s back, "What’s the name of that strike of yours?"

"Transcendent Flying Immortal," Zhou Wen answered as he walked. Soon, he entered the flower shrubs.

"Transcendent... Flying... Immortal..." The gorgeous saber flashed through Honn Shinsakura’s mind again. That gesture sent shockwaves into his soul, one that he could not forget.

An old man and a young man stood in the stone pavilion in a daze while the other stood outside the stone pavilion in a daze. After a while, Honn Shinsakura suddenly heard a cry and hurriedly turned to look at Sei Gasakai.

Sei Gasakai spat out a mouthful of blood. Honn Shinsakura hurriedly rushed to Sei Gasakai. "Teacher, what’s wrong?"

Sei Gasakai spat out a mouthful of blood, but his expression was much better. He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and revealed a smile. "So that’s how it is... I see... It’s no wonder I didn’t name the move. It turns out that deep in my heart, I knew that it wasn’t right. Now I finally understand where I was wrong..." Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

With that said, Sei Gasakai looked around but didn’t see Zhou Wen. He asked, "Where’s Zhou Wen-kun?"

"He went back," Honn Shinsakura answered.

"Why didn’t you stop him?" Sei Gasakai blurted out.

Honn Shinsakura thought to himself, How can I stop him when even you can’t?

Of course, he did not say that out loud. Sei Gasakai probably realized that something was wrong with what he said, so he asked him, "Did you ask him what the name of that attack was?"

"He said it was Transcendent Flying Immortal," Honn Shinsakura replied.

Sei Gasakai nodded and said, "So that saber move is called Transcendent Flying Immortal. My blade technique has taken the wrong path. I’ve been blindly pursuing the path of Will Renewal and life and death, but I’ve lost the true essence of Niten Ichi-ryū. To think that I was so arrogant that I thought that my accomplishments had already reached the crest of perfection and even had the thoughts of challenging Leng Zongzheng. I never expected that even a student from Sunset College could nullify my sword technique. That’s good. After this battle, I’ve finally seen the path ahead clearly. I’m going back to revise my blade technique. Are you still willing to cultivate with me?"

"You will forever be my teacher." Honn Shinsakura immediately bowed.

"Alright, we’ll head back now. I’ll revamp my blade technique. From now on, this lineage will be called the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū," Sei Gasakai said seriously.

"Niten Flying Immortal-ryū?" Honn Shinsakura looked at Sei Gasakai in confusion.

"My Sword Dao came from the Niten Ichi-ryū , and the strike that Zhou Wen-Kun used to give me a wake-up call is called Transcendent Flying Immortal. In order to show respect, my style shall be called the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. I hope that after you inherit my Sword Dao in the future, you will be able to advance further and use the blade technique of my Niten Flying Immortal-ryū to defeat his Transcendent Flying Immortal," said Sei Gasakai.

"Niten Flying Immortal-ryū?" Honn Shinsakura muttered to himself as Zhou Wen’s gorgeous saber appeared in his mind.

The master and disciple no longer went to find Leng Zongzheng and chose to leave Luoyang.

Zhou Wen didn’t take this matter to heart, but he didn’t know that in the future, the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū would become a mainstream sword sect overseas. But all of this was in the future.

After returning to his dorm, Zhou Wen began studying the Zero Taboo Life Soul. He wanted to know what use it had.

As of now, what he knew was that it could nullify the Power of Will Renewal and Power of Death, but this was clearly not the true effect of the Zero Taboo.

After launching the game dungeon, Zhou Wen entered the Metalwork Temple. He wanted to see if the Zero Taboo could block the power of the flames, but unfortunately, the blood-colored avatar was nearly burned to death.

It can’t block the power of fire? Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and changed to another dungeon. He went to the Music Temple to try resisting the sound waves.

However, it was useless. After activating the Zero Taboo, the sound wave struck the blood-colored avatar, sending it flying several meters away. It was so painful that Zhou Wen nearly convulsed.

It can’t be? Don’t tell me that this thing can only block the Power of Will Renewal and Death? Just as Zhou Wen was feeling depressed, he saw a Sun Beast rush out of the palace.

Zhou Wen didn’t experiment any further. He summoned the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and made it kill the Sun Beast. After grinding so many times, he didn’t even have a Companion Egg drop. He didn’t hold any hopes this time, but the Sun Beast ended up dropping a Companion Egg.

It’s finally here. Zhou Wen forgot about the Zero Taboo as his emotions became complicated.

With the Sun Beast, he could finally fight Torch Dragon.
