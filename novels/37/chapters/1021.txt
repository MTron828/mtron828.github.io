Chapter 1022: Carrying Her Out

Translator: CKtalon

Gradually, even Gaiman felt a little regretful. They could neither retreat nor advance. They were trapped by the puppets and didn’t even have the chance to follow the threads.

Someone was already injured. Although it didn’t look serious, it was a very bad sign.

Some people had no choice but to be ruthless to their companions who were controlled like puppets. If they didn’t do so, they would be killed.

However, killing a companion to survive wasn’t a pleasurable thing for anyone.

Therefore, they couldn’t help but blame it on Zhou Wen. They would occasionally glare at him angrily.

If they could speak, Zhou Wen would probably be drowned by their saliva.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t care about their expressions. He had been using Truth Listener to monitor the commotion nearby, hoping to discover the puppeteer as soon as possible.

This only made it appear as though he was ignoring their angry gazes. What was even more infuriating was that Zhou Wen wasn’t participating in the battle. All he did was watch from the back with Wang Lu, like a scion who had brought a beautiful lady out on a vacation.

We didn’t invite you here to hit on chicks... If he could speak, Gemar would have reprimanded Zhou Wen loudly.

Unfortunately, he could only keep it to himself. The situation was getting worse. A large number of puppets had surrounded them, preventing him from having the time to write.

More and more people were getting injured. Gaiman was already considering a retreat. Otherwise, not only would he not be able to save the nine people controlled by the puppet, but everyone else would also die here.

However, to sacrifice nine people just like that without having done anything after entering was unacceptable.

In fact, many people already had the intention to retreat. The present situation didn’t seem to allow them to continue.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen, who hadn’t participated in the battle, moved. Everyone saw him pull out the Bamboo Blade at his waist and vanish.

Where’s Zhou Wen?

Everyone looked around but didn’t find Zhou Wen.

Crack!

A black-robed dimensional creature fell from the bell tower beside them. When it fell to the ground, its body had already been split into two. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The puppets also stopped when the dimensional creature fell to the ground. The threads on the nine people who had been controlled fell off, restoring their control over their bodies.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

The string puppets shattered one after another. Everyone couldn’t help but look up and see Zhou Wen standing on the bell tower, sheathing his Bamboo Blade.

“To Witch Castle.” After Zhou Wen came down, he wrote three words on a board.

“Everyone is injured. Shall we rest for a while?” Gaiman also wrote on the cardboard.

The previous battle had injured most people, especially the nine controlled people. Their injuries were rather serious.

This was because they weren’t afraid of death when they were controlled. They had been risking their lives without any regard for themselves. Therefore, they were severely injured.

“Send back all those who are injured. The rest will follow me.” Zhou Wen wrote.

“Our injuries aren’t serious. We can continue fighting after some rest.” The big shots who had come from those places changed their impression of Zhou Wen.

However, when Zhou Wen said that, it was as though he treated them as a burden. It displeased them greatly.

“Time is life in such a place. We have to make the best use of every second. I don’t have the time to wait.” After Zhou Wen wrote the words, he pulled Wang Lu towards Witch Castle.

“Old Zhao, go back now. We’ll be out soon.” Gaiman thought for a moment and decided to let them return first.

“Go ahead. We’ll recuperate here before chasing after you. Or we can meet you guys back here.” Old Zhao wrote.

“Alright.” Gaiman thought for a moment and wrote again, “However, you have to be careful. If any dimensional creatures appear again, leave immediately.”

“Alright.” Old Zhao agreed.

Gaiman chased after Zhou Wen with the uninjured Lance, Gemar, and two other members of the Ultimate Family Clan who were slightly injured.

Fortunately, there were no more accidents along the way. The group successfully entered Witch Castle.

Zhou Wen had only seen cartoon versions of the witches in-game. Upon comparison, he realized that these witches were indeed rather beautiful and weren’t as cute as in-game.

“Welcome to the House of Destiny...” The black-and-white witch began explaining the rules of the game just like in the game.

“Wang Lu, thank you.” Gaiman looked at Wang Lu and showed her the words on the board.

Wang Lu nodded and was about to draw a card when she was stopped by Zhou Wen.

“Are you sure you’re fine? If you aren’t 100% confident, you don’t have to draw. I have a solution,” Zhou Wen asked as he wrote a few words on her palm.

“No problem. Don’t worry.” Wang Lu also wrote on Zhou Wen’s palm.

“That’s good.” Only then did Zhou Wen feel relieved.

Since Wang Lu was so confident, there shouldn’t be a problem.

Wang Lu walked in front of the white-robed witch and reached out to draw a card. When she flipped it open, it was the mask card.

Her luck sure is good. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel mixed emotions when he saw the door behind the twin witches open.

We’ve finally come this far. Gaiman looked at the space behind the door. He was somewhat nervous as he led his men towards the door.

“Go back now,” Zhou Wen wrote on Wang Lu’s palm.

“We’re already here. Can’t I go in and take a look?” Wang Lu wrote.

“No, you have to leave immediately. It will be troublesome if there’s no time.” Zhou Wen urged her to leave the maze.

“What do you mean there’s no time?” Wang Lu asked in puzzlement.

“I’ll explain it to you later. Now, you have to leave the maze immediately. You definitely can’t wait for me inside,” Zhou Wen exhorted again.

However, seeing Wang Lu’s curious expression, he knew that she definitely wouldn’t leave so easily.

Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before lifting Wang Lu up. Ignoring her objections, he carried her and sped off.

After running all the way to the entrance of the maze, Zhou Wen threw her out before turning to head for Witch Castle.

“Damn it!” Wang Lu looked hatefully at the maze door in front of her, but she wasn’t really angry. She couldn’t help but laugh when she thought of how Zhou Wen had carried her out.

Seeing that Old Zhao and company were still inside, Zhou Wen wrote. “All of you can leave. There’s no need to stay here. Otherwise, there will be danger.”

“We are willing to stay. There’s no need for you to worry.” Old Zhao was very stubborn and refused to leave.

Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to say anything else as he headed for the garden.

I hope Gaiman and company are fine. When Zhou Wen rushed to the garden, Gaiman and company had already entered without waiting for Zhou Wen to return.
