Chapter 886: Deer Terrace Pavilion’s Lower Level

Translator: CKtalon

Just as Zhou Wen was considering how to deal with the old alchemist, his phone suddenly rang. He picked it up and saw that it was Ouyang Lan.

Having had An Sheng’s warning, Zhou Wen roughly knew why Ouyang Lan was calling him, but he had no choice but to answer.

“Little Wen, where have you been? Why haven’t I seen you recently?” Ouyang Lan asked.

“I’ve been to the Zhang family’s auction. I’m on my way back now,” Zhou Wen said.

“How many days has it been? Let’s not talk about participating in the Zhang family’s auction. Even if you went overseas, you should be back by now, right?” Ouyang Lan curled her lips and said.

“I planned on visiting a friend’s place on the way,” Zhou Wen said.

“Friend? Male or female?” Ouyang Lan immediately asked.

“Male,” Zhou Wen answered.

“What’s so nice about a man? Come back quickly. I’ll introduce you to a girl. She’s not bad. If you miss this opportunity, there won’t be another.” Ouyang Lan praised the girl. She made it sound as though Zhou Wen would suffer a huge loss if he didn’t marry her.

“Sis Lan, I really can’t come back any time soon.” Zhou Wen had no choice but to find an excuse.

“I don’t care. You have to come back on the 16th of this month. I helped you arrange a meeting with her. Just do it for me and meet her. If you really don’t like her, I won’t force you.” Ouyang Lan had steeled her heart to hook Zhou Wen up on a blind date.

“I’ll try my best to return.” Zhou Wen had no choice but to brush her off.

“I don’t want you to try your best. You have to.” Ouyang Lan changed the topic and said, “By the way, you can’t accept the challenge from Uesugi Nao. We don’t know what abilities and Companion Beasts the overseas people have. What if something happens? I’m still hoping that you can give me a grandchild.”

Zhou Wen’s face darkened. “Don’t worry. I definitely won’t accept the challenge.”

After Ouyang Lan finally hung up, Zhou Wen heaved a long sigh of relief.

Looking at his itinerary, Zhou Wen felt that he should be able to make it back to Luoyang on the 16th. After some thought, he decided to return.

Firstly, he didn’t want to disappoint Ouyang Lan and didn’t want to embarrass her. Secondly, Zhou Wen needed to return as well.

With his abilities, he couldn’t kill the old alchemist. It looked like Banana Fairy wouldn’t be able to evolve anytime soon. He had to think of another way to eliminate the old alchemist.

Otherwise, Zhou Wen felt like there was a ticking time bomb hanging over his head. It made him uncomfortable.

Zhou Wen planned on luring the old alchemist to Chess Mountain. He might be able to get him and The Thearch to suffer a mutually destructive fight.

Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s fantasy. In reality, the execution involved many difficulties. The Thearch might not be willing to be used by him.

If it were in the past, there really wasn’t much I could do. However, now that I have the Earth Elemental Beast, I can directly escape into Chess Mountain. Even if The Thearch doesn’t want to help, she can’t tolerate others wreaking havoc in Chess Mountain, right? Zhou Wen rode the Great Might Vajra Bull back and returned to revise Chess Mountain’s instance dungeon.

This time, Zhou Wen had the Earth Elemental Beast. He wanted to see if he could use it to enter Chess Mountain and the lower levels of Deer Terrace Pavilion.

After entering the game, Zhou Wen didn’t wait for the flower to open the path into the mountain before riding the Earth Elemental Beast in.

After arriving at Deer Terrace Pavilion, Zhou Wen killed all the dimensional creatures inside. Finally, he used the Earth Elemental Beast to attempt to enter the treasure vault beneath Deer Terrace Pavilion. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The Earth Elemental Beast was indeed very useful. It led Zhou Wen past the foundation of Deer Terrace Pavilion and quickly arrived in a room. There was a large amount of gold, silver, and jewelry in the room, piled up like a hill.

These treasures were nothing to Zhou Wen. Furthermore, he couldn’t take out the items in-game, so he couldn’t be bothered to take a look. He pushed open the door and walked out of the room, continuing his search through the passageway outside.

Soon, Zhou Wen discovered another room. This time, he pushed it open and saw that there was no gold, silver, or jewelry inside. Instead, there was a huge wild boar sleeping inside.

The blood-colored avatar’s pushing open of the door immediately stirred the huge boar. It glared at him and got up to charge at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to rush forward to finish the boar.

Although the wild boar was very strong, it was clearly much weaker than Tyrant Behemoth. Soon, its skull was shattered by the Tyrant.

‘Killed Mythical creature, Pig Demon.’

Nothing dropped, leaving Zhou Wen somewhat depressed.

The interior of Deer Terrace Pavilion was like a huge maze with many rooms. Some of the rooms had dimensional creatures or treasures, but most of the rooms had nothing.

Previously, when I entered this place in reality, the environment there was somewhat different from here. It should be at the bottom of the foundation. Zhou Wen rode the Earth Elemental Beast and made it use Earth Escape to continue heading down.

Splash!

After the Earth Elemental Beast escaped, it fell into water. On careful look, it was a canal in the palace.

Back when I entered this place in reality, I swam in from the canal. I’m probably not far from that area now. Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t find any dimensional creatures. There weren’t any important areas nearby either. Zhou Wen continued swimming upstream, hoping to find an area similar to the one in reality.

Zhou Wen still remembered that there were many high-level dimensional crystals here. Perhaps there were many divine skill crystals.

He followed the canal to another room. The scene he saw delighted him. Although he had never been here before, there were many dimensional crystals piled on the stone platform in the room. It was like a small mountain.

As he was in-game, Zhou Wen could easily see the stats of the dimensional crystals. Most of them were at the Epic stage, but there were quite a number of Mythical ones. Zhou Wen had already seen a few of the 70-80 stat crystals, including Mythical Essence Energy Skill Crystals.

However, Zhou Wen soon noticed a strange dimensional creature lying on the mountain-like dimensional crystal.

It was a leopard-shaped dimensional creature. It had already stood up and was glaring at the blood-colored avatar.

Zhou Wen decided to strike first. He summoned Tyrant Behemoth and charged at the dimensional creature.

Tyrant Behemoth was indeed a top existence at the Mythical stage. It finished off the leopard-shaped dimensional creature with a single punch.

These are all mine... Zhou Wen looked at the dimensional crystals on the ground and had the urge to laugh out loud.

However, on careful thought, unless he absorbed the crystals himself, he couldn’t take them away. It seemed like his joy was a little premature.
