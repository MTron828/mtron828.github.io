Chapter 1878: Crystal

Translator: CKtalon

“What was it?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

“I’m not too sure what it was. I’ve also asked your grandfather. He said that it was a round crystal. When he went to seek help from my father-in-law, it was taken away for research. He didn’t return it to him,” Zhou Lingfeng said after some thought.

“A round crystal? Was it spherical or circular?” Zhou Wen’s expression immediately turned odd.

“I remember your grandfather said it was circular. He gestured back then. It didn’t look very big,” Zhou Lingfeng said as he thought.

Zhou Wen hurriedly rummaged through his things when he heard that. He remembered that there had indeed been such an item before.

!!

Back then, he had found a small metal slab in the temple in Zhuolu. The small metal slab was very similar to the large metal slab that chained Earth’s Companion Beast. Zhou Wen had used the passcode left behind by the former principal to open the small metal slab.

Inside the small metal slab was a circular crystal similar to the one Zhou Lingfeng had mentioned. It wasn’t very big, about the size of the silver Yuan Datou coin from many years back.

Zhou Wen still remembered that one side of the crystal was engraved with an anchor, while the other side was engraved with a woman’s side profile.

As he hadn’t figured out what use it had, he had thrown it in a corner after putting it away. If Zhou Lingfeng hadn’t mentioned it, Zhou Wen would have forgotten about it.

Soon, Zhou Wen found the circular crystal and handed it to Zhou Lingfeng. “Take a look at this.”

After Zhou Lingfeng took it, he looked at it carefully. After a long while, he said, “I’ve never seen that thing before. I’ve only heard your grandfather describe it. It’s been so long that I’ve almost forgotten it. Where did you get it from?”

Although Zhou Lingfeng couldn’t figure out if the crystal slab was the item his grandfather had picked up, Zhou Wen felt that it was most likely the case.

The metal slab was opened with the former principal’s passcode. The things inside must have been placed in by the former principal, just like the trapped Earth Companion Beast.

Furthermore, there was a symbol of the anchor and the woman’s side profile on the crystal. It was definitely related to the true owner of the Experimenter. This thing was most likely what An Jing’s mother had said could take her back.

Zhou Wen took back the crystal slab and bade Zhou Lingfeng farewell before turning to leave. He wanted to know if it was the device the woman had mentioned. He just needed the woman to take a look to know.

However, he was somewhat puzzled. He didn’t sense any energy from it. He hadn’t discovered anything special about it when studying it previously. How could such a thing take the woman back to where she came from?

As he pondered, Zhou Wen returned to the yard where Optimus was. An Sheng was still waiting at the door. When he saw Zhou Wen, he hurriedly welcomed him.

Before An Sheng could say a word, Zhou Wen said, “Has An Tianzuo finished his interrogation?”

“It should be soon.” An Sheng turned his head and looked inside.

“Come in.” An Tianzuo’s voice sounded.

After Zhou Wen and An Sheng entered, they realized that the woman in the ball of light was crying her heart out.

“What’s wrong with her?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

“She doesn’t know anything. She’s just a puppet that had been used,” An Tianzuo said with a nasty expression. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Have you confirmed her identity?” Zhou Wen actually wanted to ask if she was An Jing’s mother.

“I don’t know,” An Tianzuo said coldly before turning to leave, looking extremely impatient.

“I think it’s highly likely. Otherwise, Overseer wouldn’t be so vexed,” An Sheng whispered to Zhou Wen before quickly chasing after An Tianzuo.

Zhou Wen watched An Tianzuo leave before looking at the woman who was still wailing. He didn’t know what An Tianzuo had said to her to turn her into this.

“Why are you crying?” he asked the woman.

The woman ignored him and kept crying.

“Stop crying. Look at this.” Zhou Wen took out the crystal slab and waved it in front of the woman.

When the woman saw the crystal slab, her crying stopped a little. However, she was still sobbing. She glanced at the crystal slab with an indifferent expression as though she didn’t care at all. Her eyes were gray and hollow.

An Tianzuo, that bastard. What did he say to make the woman’s heart turn so ashen? Zhou Wen pondered for a moment. Seeing that the woman wasn’t looking at him, he said, “Don’t you want to know the truth? Don’t you want to know why they treated you like this? Don’t you want to know if that’s your daughter? Only by returning there can you know the truth.”

The woman’s expression didn’t change in the beginning, but towards the end, she gradually turned to look at Zhou Wen and the crystal slab in his hand.

“Is this the device you mentioned?” Zhou Wen asked again.

The woman nodded. This left Zhou Wen overjoyed. He never expected that the crucial item to resolve all the mysteries was already in his hands.

“How do I use this thing?” he hurriedly asked.

The woman’s eyes were filled with tears as she shook her head and said, “It’s useless. The Experimenter has already been destroyed. It’s useless even if we find it. We need the Experimenter to activate it.”

Zhou Wen was immediately at a loss when he heard that. The energy system and technology in that world were completely different from this world. He had nowhere to start.

“Is there no other way?” he asked with a frown.

“I don’t know. I only know that there’s a device on Experimenter that activates it. I don’t understand how those devices work at all,” the woman said in pain.
