Chapter 806: Calamity Grade

Translator: CKtalon

The snake-tailed monster guarding the stone steps appeared to have heard the funniest joke in the world. It laughed to the point of having tears stream down its face.

“You really think too highly of yourself. Don’t tell me you really think that advancing to the Mythical stage is that impressive? In the dimensional wars, the so-called Mythical stage of you humans is just cannon fodder. This is because only by reaching that level can one cross dimensions without being killed by the barriers of the different dimensions. Only ancient forbidden zones like Earth will treat the Mythical stage as something important.”

The monster continued contemptuously, “Just like how humans on Earth can’t survive in space because it doesn’t have the oxygen and other conditions you need to survive there. Becoming a Mythical stage merely means that you humans have learned how to survive in an environment without oxygen.”

“There’s naturally hope if one can learn to breathe and end up surviving,” Wang Mingyuan said.

“You need hope only for the impossible. There’s no way you can fathom what kind of existence the Dragon King is. If an ant like you hadn’t come out of the ancient forbidden land, you wouldn’t even be qualified to be a servant for the Dragon Gods, much less guard the divine tree. Yet, you actually dare to challenge the Dragon King? You’re tempting fate. There’s no need to look for the Dragon King. I’ll show you what true strength is today,” the monster said as a strange power arose from its body. It struck out at Wang Mingyuan with its hand.

The terrifying power transformed into a giant snake that tore towards Wang Mingyuan in a bid to devour him. This casual strike was so powerful that it could match Tyrant Behemoth in its Absolute Strength state.

Wang Mingyuan continued walking towards the stone steps, ignoring the terrifying snake attack.

However, when the giant snake came in front of him, it automatically disintegrated and turned into nothingness in the blink of an eye.

“You actually broke through the dimensional barrier? However, do you think that you have the right to fight our Dragon Gods? Aren’t you being too arrogant?” Although the monster was arrogant, its expression turned solemn. It no longer wore a supercilious look.

Seeing Wang Mingyuan walk over step by step, the monster clasped its hands together and presented a strange offensive stance, like a venomous snake that could devour its enemy at any moment.

“I’ll show you the true power of us Dragon Gods... Dragon God Descent...” As the monster roared, the strange power on its body was pushed to its limits. A terrifying power immediately swept through the entire space. Giant snakes of light shot out with apocalyptic might, bombarding Wang Mingyuan from all directions.

Countless giant snakes tried to devour Wang Mingyuan, but when they reached him, they automatically disintegrated. They couldn’t touch his body at all as though his body was protected by a deity.

“How... How is this possible...” The monster was alarmed when it saw that its Dragon God Descent, which had been unleashed to its limits, failed to touch Wang Mingyuan’s clothes.

As for Wang Mingyuan, he was less than three meters away from him. The stone steps leading up the mountain were already right in front of him.

“Dragons aren’t like that.” Wang Mingyuan glanced at the monster and waved his hand gently. The monster’s body seemed to be grabbed by an invisible hand as it was thrown.

Boom!

Its body slammed into the stone wall, creating a crater. Its bones seemed to have shattered and its body was covered in blood. It struggled a few times but failed to stand up. It only spat out a mouthful of blood.

“You advanced to the Calamity grade?” The monster looked at Wang Mingyuan in horror as though it had seen a ghost.

It hadn’t been long since Wang Mingyuan advanced to the Mythical stage and used the powers of the six Holy Temples to break through the dimensional barrier and enter the dimensional zone. He had even suffered the punishment of lightning smiting. Yet, he had advanced to the Calamity grade so quickly. This was just too shocking.

Even among the Octokind, which were born Mythical, there was only a handful who could advance to the Calamity grade so quickly.

Wang Mingyuan didn’t answer as he stepped onto the stone steps and walked towards the Dragon God Temple.

“Even if you’ve advanced to the Calamity grade, you are just an ant in front of the mighty Dragon King...” The monster roared, but it didn’t get a response.

...

Zhou Wen waited for the news of the Primordial Spore’s success or failure. As it was too far away, he couldn’t retrieve it. He couldn’t help but feel anxious.

From the looks of it, I’ll have to make another trip to Dragon Corpse River and find the Dragon King Gu. Even if I can’t successfully parasitize it, I have to take back Primordial Spore. With Tai Sui, the chick, and Ya’er beside him, Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of Gu at all, so he planned on making a trip to Dragon Corpse River himself.

Zhou Wen didn’t know the family that built the boats, nor did he plan on spending a large sum of money to buy a special boat. He bought an ordinary speedboat and got it transported to Dragon Corpse River.

“Friend, why did you bring a speedboat to Dragon Corpse River?” A person who was prepared to enter Dragon Corpse River to capture Gu saw Zhou Wen’s speedboat and asked curiously.

“To enter the river to catch Gu,” Zhou Wen answered.

The person sized up Zhou Wen and asked, “Friend, are you from overseas?”

“I just came to Chiang Rai a few days ago,” Zhou Wen answered truthfully.

“Then it’s no wonder. I’m afraid you don’t know the taboo of Dragon Corpse River. Typical boats will be attacked by Gu when they enter the river. You have to first get a special Gu-proof boat,” the person warned.

“Typical Gu probably wouldn’t attack my boat,” Zhou Wen said as he picked up Ya’er and boarded the speedboat. He started the speedboat’s engine and set off into Dragon Corpse River.

The person said to the disciple beside him, “That young man has really gone mad. He has actually driven a speedboat into the Dragon Corpse River. Although the engine won’t stall in Dragon Corpse River, the Gu in Dragon Corpse River will be attracted by the sound of the engine. When they crawl into the engine and cause damage to the engine, it will be impossible for him to come out again. To think he brought a child with him. He’s really hopeless.”

“This person is clearly from the East District and is very arrogant. If he wants to die, we can’t stop him,” the disciple said with a twitch of his lips.

Zhou Wen steered the speedboat while the chick and Tai Sui stood on each side of the boat. As for Ya’er, she sat beside Zhou Wen and sized up Dragon Corpse River curiously.

The Gu in Dragon Corpse River sensed the chick’s aura and didn’t dare approach the speedboat.

However, with a wave of her hand, a few Gu approached and swam beside the speedboat as though they were protecting it.

Since I’ve gotten the calabash back, should I use Ya’er to subdue some Gu? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t interested in ordinary Gu. If he really planned on subduing any, they would at least be Gu at the level of the Ice Silkworms. It would be even better if he could subdue the Dragon King Gu.
