Chapter 829: Don’t Hit The Face

“Ya’er, here’s a life lesson. Nothing else is important in life, but when it comes to eating, never compromise; otherwise, you will have come to this world for nothing. Although this small city isn’t famous, its Eight Bowl Dish is very authentic. It’s difficult to find it elsewhere. Let’s head in to have some now.” Liu Yun led Ya’er inside.

When he arrived at the reception area at the entrance, he waved his hand like he was doing a magic trick, producing a white bag. He then swaggered inside with Ya’er.

The receptionists didn’t know him, but this place was huge. There were more than a hundred tables, so it was normal for there to be unfamiliar people. Soon, someone arranged for Liu Yun to sit down.

“There will be delicious food in a while. You will definitely suffer if you follow Zhou Wen. You haven’t eaten anything delicious. It’s different if you follow me. Be it the things on mountains, in the sea, or on land. you’ll have the best to eat. Just follow me obediently. I guarantee you that you won’t regret it,” Liu Yun whispered to Ya’er.

When the people beside him heard Liu Yun, although they didn’t know him, someone who was very friendly said, “Lad, from what you said, you’ve been to many places?”

“That’s for sure. I’m not bragging. I’ve basically visited all the cities in the Federation’s four districts, big and small.” Liu Yun was even better at conversations than him. In a while, he was having a good chat with the people at his table. At the same time, he figured out who was the one having the funeral.

From the looks of it, it was obvious that the funeral wasn’t held by an ordinary family, but one of the most powerful families in the area. Three of the four brothers were at the Epic stage and were known as the Three Heroes of the Chen family. In such a small city, they could be considered top wealthy families.

Not long ago, their father had passed away. They were having the funeral for the father, and all the famous people in the area had come to pay their respects.

The deceased had many friends when he was alive, and he had good social relations. Many people came, and those who sat far away were sitting at the extra tables that were set up. Those who had invitations were all sitting in front.

Not long after, an emcee went on stage to speak.

“Dear friends and guests: Today, we are gathered here today in memory of our dear Old Master Chen...”

While the emcee was reading from his script with a sorrowful expression, everyone had solemn and sorrowful expressions. As they waited silently, they suddenly heard someone laugh. “Haha...”

Instantly, everyone’s eyes focused on the source of the laughter.

Liu Yun’s face turned livid. He didn’t know why he had suddenly laughed. He didn’t want to laugh either. He covered his face with an innocent expression.

The eldest son of the Chen family gestured for the emcee to continue. At such a time, it was not suitable to cause trouble. Even if there was something, he had to wait until the funeral was over.

“Our dear Old Master Chen was generous and helpful. He was a good boss at the company, a good husband and father at home...”

“Haha...” Laughter sounded again. This time, everyone’s eyes quickly looked at the spot where Liu Yun was sitting. The eyes of the Chen family members were murderous.

Liu Yun felt like crying. He really didn’t want to laugh, but he couldn’t help it. It worked when he covered his mouth just now, but he couldn’t stop laughing despite doing so now. Instead, it made his expression look even more wretched, as though he was snickering while covering his mouth.

“Are you f** king here to cause trouble?” The three Chen brothers couldn’t tolerate it any longer. Their friends and family were also indignant. Instantly, hundreds of people in the hall stood up and surrounded Liu Yun. All of them had ugly expressions.

“I... Haha... I really don’t want to laugh... Haha... I... Haha...” Liu Yun laughed as he spoke. He really couldn’t control himself.

“Beat him to death.” The three Chen brothers were truly enraged. The others couldn’t stand it any longer and rushed forward to beat him.

“Ah!” A tragic cry sounded in the hall. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

When Liu Yun escaped with a swollen face, he saw that Ya’er had followed him without him realizing it. They were outside the hotel.

Liu Yun picked up Ya’er and fled. There was a group of people shouting to have him killed behind him.

“Haha... Gosh... Haha... Don’t hit me in the face... These people don’t even know the rules... Haha... They know nothing...” After escaping the pursuit, Liu Yun was still laughing despite his swollen face. When he laughed, it even pulled at the injuries on his face, causing him to grimace in pain.

“What the hell. Why can’t I stop laughing?” As Liu Yun spoke, he realized that he wasn’t laughing. He was even more alarmed.

“What’s going on?” Liu Yun glanced at Ya’er and saw her pointing at a cake shop. “Hungry.”

How old is this brat? It’s impossible that it’s because of her. Could it be that I didn’t notice that I committed some taboo when I was in school? Liu Yun thought to himself.

Since he was already in this state, it was impossible for him to freeload. Liu Yun had no choice but to take Ya’er to the cake shop to buy some desserts for her.

As Ya’er ate, she looked at the injuries on Liu Yun’s face. Liu Yun took a bite of the cake and it tugged at the wound at the corner of his mouth. The corners of his mouth twitched in pain as he said gloomily, “What are you looking at? Don’t think that I’m not their match. I can kill them all with a flick of my finger, but I’m a professional and not a bandit. Do you understand?”

Ya’er lowered her head and continued eating the desserts. He did not know if she had understood him.

...

Zhou Wen knew that Liu Yun had taken away Ya’er and was forcing him to go to Mount Dragon Tiger. He wasn’t worried that Liu Yun would harm Ya’er. Liu Yun wasn’t someone who would harm a child.

Furthermore, he was going to Mount Dragon Tiger anyway, so it was fine for him to head there early.

Liu Yun wants me to find him at Mount Dragon Tiger. From the looks of it, he has his sights on the Earth Elemental Beast. Zhou Wen was still somewhat worried. It wasn’t because he was worried about Ya’er, but because he was afraid that Liu Yun would be a dead person by the time he found him.

Liu Yun didn’t know Ya’er’s origins and only treated her as a child. He probably didn’t have his guard up against her, but Ya’er wasn’t a real child. Offending her would really kill him.

Zhou Wen wasn’t wrong. If Zhou Wen hadn’t set those rules for Ya’er, Liu Yun would have been in a terrible situation if Ya’er hadn’t obeyed.

Even if Ya’er didn’t want to kill anyone, Liu Yun’s situation was equally bad.

Liu Yun originally thought that he could easily rush to Mount Dragon Tiger and wait for Zhou Wen to arrive, but to his dismay, the journey wasn’t easy at all.

Failing to freeload the previous time, Liu Yun was indignant. After arriving in another city, Liu Yun planned on freeloading at another banquet.

Liu Yun thought to himself, My bad habit of suddenly laughing should be fine at a wedding banquet. Even if it flares up, people will just think that I’m happy.

Liu Yun’s idea was pretty good, but at the wedding banquet, just as the bride and groom were about to exchange rings, Liu Yun suddenly couldn’t help but cry out loud. He cried so sadly that those who didn’t know would think that there was something between him and the bride and that he couldn’t bear to let the bride get married.

Instantly, everyone’s eyes focused on Liu Yun.

“Boohoo... I... I really don’t want to cry... Boohoo... Don’t hit my face...”
