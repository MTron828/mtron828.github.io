Chapter 1085: Paradise Mountain

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen looked up and saw a monument standing in front of the mountain. On it were the words “Paradise Mountain.”

Zhou Wen immediately knew where he was.

Back when he followed Liu Yun to the Taklamakan Desert, Liu Yun had once told him that there were four extremely terrifying dimensional zones in the desert: Death Valley, Netherworld City, the Endless Sea of Stars, and Paradise Mountain.

Zhou Wen had already been to Netherworld City and the Endless Sea of Stars. He had heard of Paradise Mountain, but he never expected to see it when he teleported back.

Since he couldn’t leave, Zhou Wen decided not to. He released Ice Maiden and Jade Rabbit and carried Demonic Neonate as he carefully sized up the Paradise Mountain stone monument.

Beneath the stone monument was a tiny palm symbol.

It’s a free dungeon. It’s a waste not to take it. Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped a picture of the tiny palm symbol. He immediately entered the download screen.

According to Liu Yun, no one who enters Paradise Mountain can come out alive. I wonder what’s so special about this mountain? Now that there’s no Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, it’s not easy to barge in. It’s best I wait until the game is downloaded before exploring in-game. Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, he heard a sweet voice coming from Paradise Mountain.

Looking up, he saw a group of bikini beauties laughing and playing. Their beautiful legs made him dizzy.

Zhou Wen sat outside the mountain and watched the beauties play. His body seemed to have an uncontrollable urge to go over. Thankfully, his will was firm. With a thought, he made the urge disappear.

He circulated the Wheel of Destiny and looked at the beauties. His pupils immediately constricted.

They weren’t beauties at all. They were just huge, ugly and evil gray rats.

What was even stranger was that the gray rats stood like humans. They wore gray cloaks and their eyes swirled with an evil light.

Upon seeing this scene, Zhou Wen summoned the Bronze Sparrow Sword. The flaming blade tore out of its scabbard and flew into Paradise Mountain, instantly killing a few evil gray-robed rats.

This stirred up the rats’ nest. A large number of gray-robed rats crawled out of the mountain forest of Paradise Mountain. Their eyes lit up as they formed a massive psyche force field. The more gray-robed rats there were, the stronger the psyche force field.

Zhou Wen immediately understood why no one returned from Paradise Mountain alive.

These gray-robed rats were good at psyche attacks. Furthermore, they could gather their psyche powers together. It was similar to the combined attack of the Musical Note Sprites.

However, these gray-robed rats were even more terrifying. Psyche attacks were difficult to defend against, and these were all at the Epic stage. Furthermore, there were many of them. Even Mythical creatures would easily be lost in their minds if they suffered their psyche attacks.

In the beginning, the Bronze Sparrow Sword wasn’t affected. It continued slaughtering the gray-robed rats, igniting flames everywhere on Paradise Mountain.

However, when thirteen red-clothed rats appeared on Paradise Mountain, the Bronze Sparrow Sword was also affected. Not only did it stop killing, but it also turned to attack Zhou Wen.

Holy sh*t, thirteen Mythical rats. This Paradise Mountain is a force to be reckoned with. Don’t tell me there are still Terror-grade existences? Zhou Wen felt a huge mental pressure as he thought to himself.

However, his willpower was extremely tenacious to begin with. Now that he had the Wheel of Destiny, he could see the true bodies of the rats. No matter what, he wouldn’t be fooled. He extended his hand and grabbed the Bronze Sparrow Sword that was in a state of betrayal.

However, the rats’ psyche strength was quite powerful. Countless Epic gray-robed rats and the thirteen red-robed rats exerted their strength together. Even the Terror-grade Jade Rabbit was affected.

Jade Rabbit’s eyes were replaced with red hearts as it slowly walked towards Paradise Mountain.

“Wake it up.” Zhou Wen felt embarrassed for Jade Rabbit. It was at the Terror grade after all, but it had been bewitched by a mischief of rats.

Ice Maiden summoned a huge block of ice and smashed it onto Jade Rabbit’s head. The ice shattered into pieces before Jade Rabbit woke up.

Although the Jade Rabbit is a pure Strength-type Companion Beast and its mental strength isn’t its specialty, it’s still at the Terror grade. To be able to affect it, these rats’ psyche skills are no trifling matter. Zhou Wen saw that Ice Maiden seemed to have the ability to restrain such psyche skills, so he got her to ascend Paradise Mountain and kill the rats first.

Ice Maiden wasn’t in the mood to play with these rats. After her Terror transformation, an ice explosion blasted most of the gray-robed rats into ice shards.

About eight of the thirteen red-robed rats died. A few were also injured.

When Zhou Wen saw the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs on the ground, he hurriedly summoned a group of Musical Note Sprites and got them to pick up the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs.

Seeing that the remaining red-robed rats were about to escape, Ice Maiden waved her hand. Cold air surged out and froze them into ice sculptures.

When Ice Maiden saw that the rats were dead and was about to return, she suddenly heard an ear-piercing shriek coming from the top of Paradise Mountain.

“Squeak!” The voice was extremely sharp. Ice Maiden’s expression changed slightly when she heard the voice. Icy light erupted from her body, as if she was resisting some terrifying power.

The Musical Note Sprites that Zhou Wen had sent into Paradise Mountain seemed to have lost their souls as they floated towards the mountaintop.

Zhou Wen stood outside Paradise Mountain and felt his mind go adrift. He almost walked into Paradise Mountain.

Thankfully, his willpower was too strong. He was only slightly dazed before he immediately recovered.

The Jade Rabbit fell into a trance again as Zhou Wen stored it into the Chaos Bead. Zhou Wen originally imagined that he couldn’t use the Chaos Bead without the First Order of Chaos, but he realized that his Essence Energy could still activate the Chaos Bead without any problems.

This made Zhou Wen suspect that it wasn’t that the Essence Energy Arts were unusable. They were, for some reason, temporarily unusable.

Ice Maiden’s eyes narrowed as she charged toward the top of Paradise Mountain. Soon, a terrifying collision sounded.

Seeing that there weren’t many rats left on Paradise Mountain, Zhou Wen decided to walk in himself. He planned on picking up the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs.

He especially wanted the dimensional crystals. Zhou Wen happened to need to build up his stats. The thirteen red-robed rats had dropped five stat crystals and a Companion Egg. It was perfect.

Even a Mythical creature couldn’t withstand the psyche influence from the mountaintop, but Zhou Wen could still maintain self-control. After walking into Paradise Mountain, he picked up the stat crystals and absorbed them without any hesitation, allowing his stats to rapidly increase.

Just as Zhou Wen picked up the Companion Egg, he saw a stream of light slash down from the mountaintop. It was an ancient sword.

If Zhou Wen hadn’t been able to see the power of the Terror grade, he probably would have died. He would have been slain by the ancient sword.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
