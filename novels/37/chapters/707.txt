The hundred names on the cube lit up. Zhou Wen suddenly felt a huge amount of energy appear out of nowhere in the bodies of his three Companion Beasts on the rankings—Tai Sui, Tyrant Behemoth, and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.

The least energy appeared in Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s body. It didn’t result in much of a change. The energy in Tyrant Behemoth’s body was extremely huge, causing Tyrant Behemoth’s body to constantly stir.

The most powerful energy was inside Tai Sui’s body. The immense power turned Tai Sui into an egg and it began to evolve.

So there are benefits for all the Companion Beasts on the rankings. They can obtain a strange energy. However, the higher the ranking, the stronger the energy obtained. As Zhou Wen thought about it, he looked at Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s situation.

As it had obtained very little energy, it had completely absorbed it.

Zhou Wen took out his phone and checked Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s stats. To his surprise, Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s Strength stat had reached 81 points.

After being strengthened by the cube the last time, all of Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s stats had reached 80 points, but that was all. They were still within the limits of Mythical creatures.

This time, the energy obtained by Six-Winged Guardian Dragon allowed its Strength to break through to 81 points. Although it was only one point, it was very significant. This was because only a top Mythical creature had stats with 81 points.

As Six-Winged Guardian Dragon had never accepted challenges, its ranking kept dropping when it was challenged by other Companion Beasts. It had ended up in the seventies. For such a ranking to increase its stat by one point was amazing enough.

Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to see Tyrant Behemoth. He wanted to know what kind of strengthening it had obtained. It was ranked fourth, so the energy it obtained would be immense. It was incomparable to the energy that Six-Winged Guardian Dragon had received.

When Zhou Wen looked at Behemoth, he realized that the power in its body was constantly erupting. Its stats hadn’t changed for the time being.

After more than an hour, the energy in Behemoth gradually stopped erupting. Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at its stats.

Behemoth’s stats were top-notch to begin with. Now, it remained unchanged at 81 points.

Zhou Wen carefully looked at Tyrant Behemoth’s Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny. There were no changes either. When Zhou Wen saw Behemoth’s talent skills, he was immediately overjoyed.

Originally, Tyrant only had one talent skill—Mountain Consuming. But now, Tyrant Behemoth had an additional skill. The skill’s name was “Rampage.”

After reading the introduction of the Rampage skill, Zhou Wen was even more excited. This skill could enhance its Speed and Strength for a short period of time. It was very useful for Tyrant Behemoth, allowing its strength to improve further.

If I had known that there would be so many benefits, I would have gotten all my Companion Beasts to get a ranking. Even if I can’t obtain any talent skills, it’s good to increase their stats.

Of course, Zhou Wen was only musing. It wasn’t worth it to expose his Companion Beast’s abilities to exchange for stats.

The skills obtained by Tyrant Behemoth were just icing on the cake. It didn’t have an absolute effect on Tyrant Behemoth’s strength. The one with the greatest influence was Tai Sui who was evolving.

The immense energy allowed Tai Sui to directly evolve. By the time it completed its evolution, it would be at the Mythical stage.

In addition, Tai Sui had obtained first place. He likely had a chance of plucking the divine fruit, but Zhou Wen didn’t discover the passageway that led to the divine tree.

Just as he was feeling suspicious, he saw a pillar of light rise from the center of the cube, leading straight into the void.

Zhou Wen was hesitating about walking towards the pillar of light when he suddenly realized that a figure was slowly descending from it. It was none other than the Mythical Wang Mingyuan.

Wang Mingyuan slowly landed on the cube and said to Zhou Wen, “I never expected the Companion Beast that obtained first place to be yours, Little Wen.”

Zhou Wen looked at Wang Mingyuan and was momentarily at a loss for words.

Wang Mingyuan was his teacher and had treated him pretty well. In this aspect, Zhou Wen should respect him.

However, at the same time, Wang Mingyuan had caused great harm to the Federation. From this angle, Wang Mingyuan was already an enemy of humanity. Zhou Wen was a part of humanity, so he should treat Wang Mingyuan as an enemy.

Therefore, Zhou Wen’s emotions were extremely complicated. He looked at Wang Mingyuan and opened his mouth before calling out, “Teacher.”

Wang Mingyuan could tell that Zhou Wen was struggling internally, but he thought nothing of it. He smiled slightly and said, “I’m already very gratified that you can call me teacher again. Come, pluck the reward you deserve.”

With that said, Wang Mingyuan walked up the pillar of light. At the end of the pillar of light, a phenomenon of a divine garden appeared. The divine tree also appeared.

Zhou Wen followed behind Wang Mingyuan and walked into the pillar of light. Immediately, he felt a gentle force envelop his body as he slowly rose up and headed for the divine garden at the end of the pillar.

Soon, Zhou Wen followed Wang Mingyuan into the garden and immediately smelled a fruity fragrance.

The air in the divine garden was clean and pure. Even with the Holy Hell King’s eyes, he couldn’t sense any impurities. There was no dust or bacteria. It was like the legendary Paradise.

Here, even if one wanted to get sick, it was probably very difficult. There was no way to get infected.

“Do you know the name of this tree?” Wang Mingyuan walked to the divine tree and stared at it with a complicated expression.

“Is its name important?” Zhou Wen asked.

“To ordinary people, its name isn’t important, but to me, its name is very important,” Wang Mingyuan said.

“What’s its name?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

“Its name is Samsara,” Wang Mingyuan said slowly.

Samsara? Zhou Wen looked at the Samsara Tree with mixed feelings as he thought to himself, If there’s really samsara in this world, will Teacher make the same choice in this life if he were to live again?

“Little Wen, go pluck that divine fruit. This is the only ripened divine fruit in the past year. It can allow any Companion Beast to advance to the Mythical stage. Even if it’s just a Mortal Companion Beast, as long as it consumes the divine fruit, it can still advance to the Mythical stage,” Wang Mingyuan said.

Although he had guessed it, Zhou Wen still asked, “What if a human eats it?”

“I don’t think you will like that outcome.” Wang Mingyuan smiled and continued, “Of course, you can also give it a try. There are some things that you have to experience before you know whether they’re good for you. There’s not much time left. Quickly pluck the divine fruit and don’t let it fall to the ground. Otherwise, it will be useless.”

Zhou Wen walked to the Samsara Tree and reached out to grab the ripened fruit. With a gentle tug, he plucked off the fruit.
