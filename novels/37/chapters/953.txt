Chapter 954: Strange Chess Game

Translator: CKtalon

Li Xuan asked curiously, “What kind of chess do you play?”

The black-robed Chess Soul smiled without answering. “You humans are just too curious. Now isn’t the time to explain this. You should fulfill your promise.”

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “Take Ya’er down the mountain first. If it’s just destroying the Guardian cocoon. I alone am enough.”

Before Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan could say a word, the black-robed Chess Soul said, “It’s useless. Once the Guardian breaks out of the cocoon, the surrounding area will be under its control. Let alone the foot of the mountain, even if you walk another fifty kilometers, he will still be able to cover the area with his ability.”

However, Zhou Wen didn’t care. He got Li Xuan and company to descend the mountain while he stood in front of the cocoon alone.

As he didn’t know what abilities the Guardian inside had, Zhou Wen didn’t forcefully tear open the cocoon. He summoned Explosive Fiend Man and made it use Time Bomb on the cocoon.

“When I’m far away, I’ll blast open the Guardian cocoon. It’s best you stay away,” Zhou Wen said as he descended the mountain and retreated a distance with Ya’er and company.

At the limit of Explosive Fiend Man’s range, Zhou Wen ordered Explosive Fiend Man to detonate the Time Bombs that covered the Guardian cocoon.

Boom!

With an earth-shattering boom, the Guardian cocoon exploded into pieces as the Guardian inside appeared.

Guardians were basically in human form. Although they were somewhat different from real humans, they weren’t too different. At most, they had wings or heads that resembled animals.

However, the Guardian that appeared looked completely different. At first glance, nothing about it resembled a human.

This Guardian looked like a canine or feline, but its body wasn’t made of flesh and blood. Its outer shell appeared metallic, like a kind of mechanical creature.

The moment this strange Guardian appeared, it immediately confronted the black-robed Chess Soul. A powerful aura erupted between the two.

“Is the battle about to begin?” Li Xuan said excitedly as he looked at the mountaintop.

“It has already begun.” Zhou Wen looked around. Ever since the Guardian appeared, a certain nomological force had covered a large area. They were already far enough from Chess Mountain, but they were still within the range of influence.

Furthermore, this nomological force was clearly different from Mt. Chinese Chess’s nomological forces.

Zhou Wen also focused on the mountaintop. This battle might be different from ordinary battles. After all, the power possessed by the Chess Soul and Guardian was different from ordinary battle-type Guardians and dimensional creatures.

Just as Zhou Wen was looking forward to the battle between them, he saw them sit down in front of a chessboard.

“What the hell! So it’s still a game of chess!” Li Xuan said in disappointment.

However, what they saw next was somewhat different from what they had imagined.

The chess pieces on the chessboard automatically exploded. Even the chessboard was somewhat different.

Clang!

When a chess piece landed on the board, the three of them took a look. It was still the familiar Chinese chess piece with the word ‘Horse’ written on it.

“Quick, dodge!” The moment the chess piece landed, Zhou Wen felt his heart palpitate. He suddenly pushed Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan as he quickly retreated with Ya’er in his arms.

Boom!

A huge hoof print appeared where they had been standing, as though some invisible terrifying creature had landed there.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen had reacted quickly enough. Otherwise, they would have been flattened.

“What the hell was that?” Li Xuan got up and threw out a Gu. The Gu charged at the hoof mark, but it rushed straight through it as though there was nothing there.

Boom!

Another loud bang sounded. Not far from them, a hill collapsed as though something heavy had fallen.

Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at the chessboard and saw that there was an additional chess piece on it. It was a piece played by the black-robed Chess Soul.

The chess piece was different from the Guardian’s chess piece. Although it was also a horse, there were no words written on it. Instead, it was a statue-like chess piece in the shape of a horse’s head.

“That piece should be chess from the West District, right?” Zhou Wen said with an odd expression. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Probably. Although I’ve never played it before, I’ve seen others play it before. It should be from the West District. It’s completely different from the Chinese chess in the East District.” Li Xuan used insect eyes to see the chessboard on the mountain.

Boom! Boom!

As the Guardian and the black-robed Chess Soul kept placing pieces down, the surrounding space seemed to have invisible giants land, causing the ground, mountains, and rivers to constantly crack.

As for the Guardian, it seemed to deliberately target them. Every time it placed a piece, it would cause a disaster where they were. It made Zhou Wen and company constantly move to avoid the disasters that appeared out of nowhere.

“We can’t stay here. We have to get out.” Li Xuan led the way out.

However, disasters continued to descend. They were nearly hit several times.

Due to the nomological force, they would probably be instantly killed if they were struck. No matter how strong their bodies were, it was useless in front of laws.

“Get on.” Zhou Wen summoned the Earth Elemental Beast and got Li Xuan and company to sit on it before letting it leave by burrowing through the earth.

However, when the Earth Elemental Beast reached about fifty kilometers, it couldn’t escape. No matter how it tried to escape, it kept circling around the edge.

Zhou Wen used the Heaven-Opening Scripture and attempted to take a step out. He did exit himself, but Ya’er was isolated inside. He couldn’t take her out.

“From the looks of it, everything within a fifty-kilometer radius has become a chessboard that corresponds to the game. Wherever the chess piece lands, it will form a connection with the corresponding location, causing terrifying destructive power,” Feng Qiuyan said.

Boom!

Another chess piece landed where they were standing. Thankfully, Zhou Wen had already seen the spot where the chess piece landed. He determined the corresponding spot in reality and dodged it with them.

I have to deal with that Guardian. Zhou Wen handed Ya’er to Li Xuan and rode the Earth Elemental Beast to the side, heading straight for Mt. Chinese Chess.

He didn’t care about the rules. He wanted to kill the Guardian.

Perhaps the Guardian’s target was Zhou Wen. The moment Zhou Wen appeared, its chess piece landed again. This time, it was a piece with the word “Cannon.” When it landed, it left a huge blast crater in the ground.

With the protection of the Heaven-Opening Scripture, Zhou Wen ignored the laws and pulled out Light Concealment Sword. With a Sky Slash, he slashed at the canine robot-like Guardian, hoping to kill it and end the terrifying game.
