Chapter 1396: Seeking Perfection

Translator: CKtalon

Berserker ultimately didn’t attack Wang Mingyuan as he tore through the air and left the Octokind.

Although the sword intent around him was terrifying when he returned, it no longer delivered the shock and awe from before. Instead, it made him appear to be in a sorry state. The Octokind looked at Wang Mingyuan with strange emotions.

Buddha seemed to acquaint himself with Wang Mingyuan for the first time as he sized him up deeply before leaving the Octokind without a word.

Although Berserker didn’t take action, his departure left a huge impact on the Octokind and their Buddha race. Buddha didn’t know how to deal with it, so he could only choose to do nothing and rush back to report the matter to the Buddha race.

In an ancient temple, the Buddha reported the matter to an ancient Buddha.

The ancient Buddha’s eyebrows were connected and drooped all the way to the ground. His skin was wrinkled like tree bark and his body was covered in dust. He looked like a clay statue as he sat there.

After hearing what had happened, the ancient Buddha finally opened his eyes. The eyes weren’t like an elder’s eyes. They were bright and deep, as though billions of grains of sand were flowing in them.

His entire body was ancient and deathly still. Only his eyes were filled with vitality, making him look like a youth.

“Supreme One, for Berserker to be able to tolerate this and not kill Wang Mingyuan on the spot, there should still be room for negotiation, right?” the Buddha asked with a bow.

However, the ancient Buddha said indifferently, “It’s not that he doesn’t want to kill, but he doesn’t know if he can.”

The Buddha was taken aback, unsure what the ancient Buddha meant. If Berserker wanted to kill someone, there was no one beneath the Apocalypse grade that he couldn’t kill.

The ancient Buddha continued, “Berserker is known as the number one Calamity under the Apocalypse grade. It’s definitely not a lie. Do you think an ordinary Calamity can slap his face just like that? Even if he was momentarily distracted, how could he be slapped a second time?”

Only then did Buddha come to a realization as he said in surprise, “Supreme One, you mean that Wang Mingyuan is stronger than Berserker?”

“I don’t know. Berserker might not know either. Furthermore, Wang Mingyuan is right. There are only so many humans on Earth who can be used, so Berserker didn’t take action,” said the ancient Buddha.

However, the more the Buddha thought about it, the more alarmed he became. “Apart from the Holy Temple and the six families, the factions that can be used are basically under the control of Wang Mingyuan’s disciples. Did he do it intentionally? If he did, isn’t this too terrifying? The Holy Temple has been plotting for so long, but they ultimately failed to control the situation. Wang Mingyuan only used a few disciples… If it’s unintentional, is that possible?”

“Regardless of whether it was intentional or not, this person will play a decisive role in the future competition for Earth. He can’t be underestimated,” said the ancient Buddha.

“Now that he is a subsidiary of our race, can we…” the Buddha said with suppressed excitement.

“Fortune and disaster are two sides of the same coin. Why bother yourself? Go.” As the ancient Buddha spoke, he slowly closed his eyes and returned to his clay statue-like appearance.

The Buddha looked at the ancient Buddha in a daze before bowing and leaving.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in a good mood. He had already attempted pet fusion several times.

As he was afraid of failure, Zhou Wen used Companion Eggs as supplementary fusion materials every time. Such fusion only allowed him to fuse the skills without changing Tyrant Behemoth.

Furthermore, they were all combinations of species with higher success rates. They ensured that Tyrant Behemoth wouldn’t be damaged because of failure.

However, no matter how he tried, Zhou Wen failed to obtain the skills he wanted.

Every time one skill was added, the next skill added would erase the previous skill.

Through repeated fusions, one skill or the other would vanish. It nearly drove Zhou Wen crazy.

He tried the Bloodline function again which allowed Tyrant Behemoth to have a second Life Providence, but he failed many times as well. Thankfully, the Bloodline function only expended supplementary materials and didn’t harm the main pet.

After repeated failures, Zhou Wen had the urge to fuse Deva Asura and Tyrant Behemoth together.

Deva Asura’s offensive strength was very strong, but it was still much weaker than Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength. However, Deva Asura’s lucky critical strike was very useful. It wasn’t bad to be able to fuse it.

However, with so many failures, Zhou Wen didn’t dare take the risk. Furthermore, it wasn’t of much use.

He had to farm for Companion Eggs while fusing. If he couldn’t obtain suitable Companion Eggs, he wouldn’t even have the chance to fuse them.

Now, Zhou Wen had given Tyrant Behemoth five skills from all his attempts—Armor Breaker, Penetration, Ripping, Unstoppable, and God of Combat Blessing. Previously, it had Ever-Victorious, but it was wiped out when he was trying for Unstoppable.

Up to now, he still hadn’t been able to have Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable together. He either lacked this or that.

In fact, Zhou Wen had already spent money to buy quite a number of Companion Eggs for fusion. He didn’t know how long it would take for him to obtain one from farming.

This is the last Companion Egg with Ever-Victorious.?Zhou Wen looked at the Companion Egg in his hand and hesitated about fusing it.

To be honest, the five skills were already very good. They basically boosted Tyrant Behemoth’s offensive strength, but without Ever-Victorious, Zhou Wen found it a little incomplete.

However, Zhou Wen had bought all the Companion Eggs he could. He wasn’t afraid of spending money, but now, he couldn’t buy them even if he had the money.

Life is about completion and being at ease. I’ll fuse them.?Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and slotted in the last Companion Egg with Ever-Victorious.

Amidst the light, the Companion Egg fused with Tyrant Behemoth, shimmering with a successful fusion glow.

Zhou Wen was uneasy as he glanced at Tyrant Behemoth that had completed its fusion. He immediately felt a chill run down his spine.

Not only did it fail to fuse Ever-Victorious, but it also wiped out Unstoppable and God of Combat’s Blessing. Apart from Armor Breaker, Penetration, and Ripping, a Poison Fang skill was fused. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

My Tyrant Behemoth isn’t a poison-type creature. What’s the point of fusing Poison Fang? Return my Unstoppable!?Zhou Wen wanted to cry.

Now, there were no more Unstoppable or Ever-Victorious Companion Eggs. It was over.

“Ah Sheng, is there anyone else selling Overlord Snake Companion Eggs?” Zhou Wen had no choice but to ask An Sheng.

“Young Master, the Overlord Snakes that can be used and bought have all been bought by me. The Overlord Snakes in Dragon Gate Grotto have all been cleaned out. The price of Overlord Snake Companion Eggs has doubled, yet there are none for sale,” An Sheng answered helplessly.

Zhou Wen asked about the few more Companion Beasts he needed, but the answer was the same. They couldn’t be bought.

What should I do??Zhou Wen was extremely depressed. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have gone with the fusion. At the very least, there was Unstoppable. The augmentation of the God of Combat’s Blessing wasn’t bad either. It augmented his surroundings pretty well.

Sweetie watched Zhou Wen from the side the entire time, having been by his side all this while. However, she didn’t let him see her. This was because she hadn’t been able to help him when he was in danger, so she was somewhat embarrassed to appear in front of him again.

Seeing Zhou Wen’s depressed look, Sweetie seemed to come to a decision.
