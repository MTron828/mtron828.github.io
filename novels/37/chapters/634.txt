Chapter 635 Netherworld City

“Death Valley, Netherworld City, the Endless Sea of Stars, and Paradise Mountain. These are the four most terrifying dimensional zones that appeared after the transformation of the Taklamakan Desert. If humans enter, it’s highly likely that they won’t be able to survive,” said Liu Yun.

“Then why are you taking me to the Endless Sea of Stars?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“I’ve entered the Endless Sea of Stars before, and I know how to leave. As long as I don’t venture too deep, there won’t be any danger. However, I’ve only heard of Netherworld City and have never seen it before. I heard from the people in the desert that Netherworld City can only be seen at certain times. Many people might not even see it once in their entire lives in the desert, but who knew that it would be such a coincidence for us to encounter it? Is the thing you planted on me still there?” Liu Yun asked Zhou Wen suspiciously.

“Do I look like an idiot? I wouldn’t want to die with you, right?” Zhou Wen curled his lips.

Liu Yun thought that it made sense. If they entered the desert together, Zhou Wen wouldn’t be able to escape the same fate if he died from encountering Netherworld City.

“What kind of place is Netherworld City?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I don’t know. I’ve only heard that none of the people who have seen Netherworld City can return alive. I didn’t believe it in the past, but this city is indeed strange. I’ve already changed directions, and it’s impossible I backtracked; yet, here we are, seeing it again.” Liu Yun’s expression didn’t look too good.

“Since we can’t shake it off, let’s head over and take a look.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he jumped off the turtle’s back. After adhering the Substitute Talisman to himself, he summoned Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and allowed it to appear on his back in its companion form.

He wore Truth Listener the entire time. He directly summoned Tyrant Behemoth and made it scout ahead.

Liu Yun knew that they couldn’t hide from Netherworld City after encountering it, so he decided to take a look first.

He summoned Genie and Orange Cat. He wore the pair of bracers and summoned a few Epic Companion Beasts.

After summoning, he saw that Zhou Wen was still summoning Companion Beasts. Not only did he summon the Golden Overlord Sword, but he also had a Golden Battle God Halberd floating beside him.

“Junior Brother, don’t tell me you’re in the same industry as me?” Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen’s Mythical Companion Beasts and felt like he had wasted all his years. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He used to think that he was doing pretty well. Among his peers, even the geniuses of the six families might not have as many Mythical Companion Beasts as he did. However, compared to Zhou Wen, he immediately felt like he was a country bumpkin.

Zhou Wen ignored him and summoned some Vajra Mallas that served as cannon fodder. Due to the intense sunlight here, the Poison Bats’ combat strength would be greatly weakened, so Zhou Wen didn’t use them.

A few Vajra Mallas scouted ahead. Zhou Wen and Liu Yun followed behind as they headed for Netherworld City.

Netherworld City’s huge doors were tightly shut. The doors were carved from yellow jade. On each of the two doors, there was a tiny ghost image which looked very sinister.

When they arrived in front of the city gate, nothing happened. While Liu Yun sized up the city gate, Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped a picture of the tiny palm symbol beside the words ‘Netherworld City.’

The palm of the tiny palm symbol didn’t hold the symbol of Netherworld City, but a ring. He did not know what it meant.

After taking a picture on his phone, Zhou Wen immediately entered the download interface, making him feel a lot more at ease.

As long as he could download the map, he could explore the secret of Netherworld City in-game. No matter how strange it was, there was no need to be afraid.

With the combat strength of Zhou Wen’s current Companion Beast lineup, he should be able to clear anything unless he encountered an unreasonable existence like The Thearch.

Before he could finish downloading the map, he suddenly heard a strange voice coming from the gates of Netherworld City. “Welcome to Netherworld City.”

Zhou Wen looked in the direction of the voice and saw that it came from the two ghost faces on the door.

The two ghost faces revealed a strange smile as they stared at Zhou Wen and Liu Yun.

Liu Yun and Zhou Wen looked warily at the two ghost faces on the door, not daring to act rashly.

“Before entering the city, there are three ironclad rules you must not violate. Take heed,” the ghost face on the left said.

“First, murderers in Netherworld City will die,” the ghost face on the right said with a smile.

“Second, anyone whose two feet leave the ground will die,” the ghost face on the left said.

“Third, kill one person for every day you are inside the city, or you will have to commit suicide,” the ghost face on the right said.

“Welcome to the city,” the two ghost faces said the last sentence in unison as the door to Netherworld City opened.

“What kind of bullsh*t ironclad rules are those? The first rule clearly states that we are not allowed to kill. The third rule says that we have to kill one person a day. It’s completely bullsh*t,” said Liu Yun.

However, the two ghost faces had already closed their eyes as though they were asleep. They ignored Liu Yun.

Zhou Wen looked at Netherworld City, but the city was blinding. He couldn’t see anything.

Truth Listener’s ability couldn’t hear any sound in Netherworld City. Zhou Wen did not know what force had affected it.

“Let’s not enter the city now.” Zhou Wen planned on entering the city in-game after the map was downloaded.

However, Zhou Wen soon realized that it wasn’t up to them whether they entered the city.

A raging fire burned outside the city, as though the entire desert had turned into burning hell. The Vajra Mallas beside them were immediately burned to ashes when they touched the flames.

It was the same for one of Liu Yun’s Epic pets. When it touched a spark, it immediately burned and was reduced to ashes in the blink of an eye.

Seeing the flames rapidly reach the city gates, it was obvious that they were forced to enter the city. They didn’t have any other choice. If they didn’t wish to die in the sea of flames, they could only enter the city.

“Let’s enter the city now.” Liu Yun saw that the fire was about to reach his feet. Genie, who was a fire-elemental Companion Beast, was helpless against the flames. All he could do was shout and charge into the city gates.

Zhou Wen could only follow by carefully charging into the city.

At the instant they passed through the city gates, they realized that the Companion Beasts they summoned had automatically returned to their bodies, turning into tattoos.

It was a little different from what they had imagined. The city wasn’t hell, but a seemingly normal street. There were all sorts of strange buildings on both sides of the street.

Strangely, there were humanoid creatures standing on the streets. There were only a few of them.

As far as their eyes could see, there were about twenty to thirty people on the long street. However, those people were very strange. All of them stood motionless, as though their feet had been nailed to the ground.
