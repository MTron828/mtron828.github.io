Chapter 213 Lunatic

This was not the first time Zhou Wen had seen an image of the anchor. This was because women were typically taboo to sailors out at sea. Therefore, it was impossible for women to be engraved on an anchor, but this anchor symbol had a woman’s side profile on it. This left a deep impression on him.

Zhou Wen hadn’t figured out what the anchor symbol meant, so he was rather curious. Now, suddenly seeing such a tattoo on the person’s arm, he really wanted to ask him about the origins of it.

Alas, this person was another lunatic. He was running around like a madman. Despite being blind, he kept running. He stumbled and fell several times but refused to stop.

He mentioned that he had seen a ship, and that someone was engaging in murder on it. Does that anchor symbol have any relationship to the ship he mentioned? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

Looking at the ancient Trajectory Holy Temple in the distance, Zhou Wen suddenly realized that his previous guess was wrong.

Most of the six original heroes died in the dimensional zones. Only the old hero of the Dugu family remained well and alive. Perhaps it was not because he had run the fastest.

From the looks of it, he must have seen something terrifying in the Trajectory Holy Temple. Typically, there are two possibilities. One is that there’s really something terrifying inside which is why he is so afraid. Another possibility is that there aren’t any terrifying things inside. All he saw was an illusion. Either way, this doesn’t look like a test of Speed-type physique. As Zhou Wen was in thought, the person had slammed himself into a tree due to his blindness. He fainted as a result.

Zhou Wen walked to the madman and checked his injuries. He realized that he had only suffered superficial wounds and there weren’t any serious problems. He had only fainted.

“Do you know who he is?” Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan.

Those who were able to enter the Holy Land were either descendants of the six heroes or the representatives of powerful figures. Although Zhou Wen didn’t know him, a knowledgeable person like Li Xuan might.

If he could figure out the identity of this lunatic, he might be able to figure out something about him. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, Li Xuan shook his head and said, “I don’t know him. However, judging from his attire, he doesn’t look like someone from the six families. He might be here to represent some big shot.”

With Li Xuan not being able to recognize him, Zhou Wen was out of ideas as he said to Li Xuan, “Is there any way to take him out? He’s a lunatic and now he’s blind. If we leave him here, he might not be able to survive.”

“I’m afraid there’s no other way now. It’s easy to enter the Holy Land, but to leave, the six temples need to make a decision regarding their successors before a path will be opened. Now, no one can leave,” Li Xuan said with a shake of his head.

Zhou Wen had the intention of taking him out and asking about his background, but if he had to wait that long, it wouldn’t be convenient to take a lunatic along the way.

“Let’s do this. Tie him on my mount and we can bring him with us. After all, I caused him to become blind. It’s not good to leave him here,” Li Xuan said with a sigh.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen happened to share the same thoughts, so he immediately agreed.

After Li Xuan summoned a pet cow, the duo lifted the madman onto the cow’s back and used a rope to secure him on it before continuing on their journey to the other temples.

After walking for a short distance, they heard the crazy man on the cow’s back speaking. The two of them thought that he had woken up, but when they took a closer look, they saw him lying there and muttering to himself as if he was deliriously talking in a dream.

“Trajectory Holy Temple... I must go to the Trajectory Holy Temple... As long as I enter the Trajectory Holy Temple, I’ll know what exactly happened on the ship... Why are they killing each other... Why... Don’t... Don’t kill me... Don’t kill me... I didn’t see anything...” He mumbled incoherently in his dreams. Everything was fine at first, but it developed into a nightmare-like wail.

After listening for a while, Zhou Wen suddenly had the urge to enter the Trajectory Holy Temple to take a look.

Although this lunatic was somewhat incoherent, from what he had said, it was very possible that he had indeed been on a ship before. However, something unexpected had happened on the ship in the end. The people on the ship had been killing each other or killing someone. And this person had survived.

However, even the person in question didn’t know what had happened on the ship back then, so he wanted to use the power of the Trajectory Holy Temple to find out.

If this theory was valid, then the power in the Trajectory Holy Temple’s trajectory was very likely to allow people to see the past. That was why this person wanted to use its power.

In other words, it shouldn’t be because the power in the Trajectory Holy Temple had driven him mad. It was the happenings on the ship that he had seen that left him so frightened.

As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the man seemed to wake up from his nightmare. He immediately straightened his body, but he couldn’t sit up after being tied down. He could only stick to the cow’s back as his body stiffened like a stick.

“Who are you? What are you trying to do?” the lunatic shouted in horror.

“Brother, don’t be afraid. We don’t have any ill intentions. We were afraid that you would go crazy and run around, so we tied you up on the cow’s back. When the exit is opened, we will take you out of the Holy Land. The treatment techniques these days are excellent, and with the usable powers of a Companion Beast, you can definitely have your eyes healed.” Li Xuan didn’t care if he could understand and spoke quickly.

That person seemed to sober up a little. He wasn’t as afraid as before, but he was still a little agitated. He shouted, “I don’t want to leave! Let go of me! I want to enter the Trajectory Holy Temple...”

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan exchanged looks and could see the shock in each other’s eyes. This person had been so afraid moments ago that he was about to commit suicide, but now, he was insisting on returning to the Trajectory Holy Temple. It was truly baffling what he was up to.

“Brother, don’t be agitated. You just came out from the Trajectory Holy Temple. Why do you want to enter now?” Li Xuan asked curiously.

“I want... I want...” The madman thought for a long period of time but couldn’t come up with a reason. Then, he suddenly froze and said in a daze, “What do I want? What do I want?”

“This person is really crazy.” Li Xuan shook his head with a wry smile.

Zhou Wen looked at the lunatic with a frown without saying a word. He really was curious about the madman’s affairs, but from the looks of it, he was unlikely to fathom anything out. This fellow’s brain was completely damaged.

The madman suddenly used all his strength to break the rope. He jumped off the cow’s back and ran in the direction of the Trajectory Holy Temple. His speed was so surprisingly fast that Zhou Wen and Li Xuan didn’t react in time.
