Chapter 731: Coach, You’re a Nice Guy

Translator: CKtalon

Beep... Zhou Wen was grinding while sitting on the log when he suddenly heard his phone ring. He picked it up and realized that it was from Feng Qiuyan.

“Coach, you’re a nice guy. I believe you’ll meet the best person in the future. I just want to focus on practicing my saber. I don’t plan on considering personal problems. It’s not you, it’s me...”

Zhou Wen was confused, unsure of what was going on.

Feng Qiuyan was usually cool. Apart from practicing his saber techniques, he seldom spoke to others. Why would he suddenly send such a strange message to him? It didn’t seem like his style at all.

Could it be that he was hacked like me? As Zhou Wen thought about it, he sent Feng Qiuyan a message: “Little Yanyan, have you been hacked?”

When Feng Qiuyan received Zhou Wen’s message and saw the way he addressed him as Little Yanyan, he suddenly shivered for some reason.

This nickname was given to him by Li Xuan. He was used to being called that, so he didn’t feel anything. He didn’t mind it either.

However, for some reason, when he saw this nickname today, he found it a little strange. It weirded him out in an indescribable manner.

“I wasn’t hacked. Coach, we are still students. We should prioritize our studies. Besides, the Federation is in a dire situation now. Everyone has a responsibility for the Federation’s rise and fall...” Feng Qiuyan thought about how to reason with Zhou Wen without making him lose his dignity and not be sad about being rejected. He also hoped that it could be an impetus for him to work even harder.

Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss as he suddenly realized something. He immediately sent a message to Feng Qiuyan. “Before this message, did I send you a message? If there’s one, send me a screenshot.”

Zhou Wen took a screenshot of the first message Feng Qiuyan had sent him and sent it over. He felt that something was amiss.

Indeed, it didn’t take long for Feng Qiuyan to send a screenshot over. He even added, “Coach, it’s really not that you aren’t good enough, but that I really just want to focus on practicing my saber.”

When Zhou Wen saw the screenshot, he wished he could immediately find a hole to burrow in. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

F**k your sister. Who the hell is behind this? Zhou Wen felt like killing someone. If this continued, he would definitely go crazy.

Left with no choice, Zhou Wen sent a message to Feng Qiuyan to explain the theft of his account.

“Yes, yes. I understand, Coach. I won’t tell anyone about this,” Feng Qiuyan replied.

“F**k that, what are you thinking? My account has really been hacked.” Zhou Wen felt like crying, but Feng Qiuyan’s words reminded him of something.

Zhou Wen hurriedly sent a message to all his friends, telling them that his account had been hacked. If there were any abnormal messages from him, they mustn’t believe it.

Not long after, people replied to him with all sorts of messages. Some said that he had cheated them of their money and wanted them to return it. Others said that they had confessed to her and wanted him to take responsibility. However, they were all joking. Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief when he learned that the rest hadn’t received any special messages.

Zhou Wen switched off his phone before considering the matter. He felt that something was amiss, as though it wasn’t as simple as being hacked.

This seems to have happened after I entered the hotel which had the television automatically switched on. Could it be that something has happened to my phone? Zhou Wen felt that the two matters were related.

He checked his phone and didn’t find any problems. Everything inside was normal.

For this, Zhou Wen even especially found the internal structure of the phone and compared it to his own. However, there was nothing abnormal. No special components were installed inside.

After switching on the phone again, Zhou Wen wiped his phone again and restored its factory settings. He did it again, but he didn’t know if it was of any use.

That’s not right. Zhou Wen looked at the screen and suddenly discovered a problem.

The phone was normal, but the only abnormal thing was the battery.

In the past two days, Zhou Wen hadn’t charged his phone at all. Although he didn’t usually use the phone, it had been on standby for a few days. Furthermore, he had been using it for quite some time; yet, the battery was still at 100% charge. This was clearly abnormal.

Zhou Wen discovered this anomaly and immediately thought of the television that had automatically switched on in the hotel.

I don’t know why there was an electric current in the television previously that allowed it to automatically switch on. Now, the battery in my phone doesn’t run out of charge. Could it be caused by the same thing? Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to check the phone’s battery, but he didn’t find any problems. He just found plenty of charge in the battery.

Although smashing the phone might resolve the problem, it was only a possibility. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and didn’t smash the phone. He switched it off.

Not long after, his body finally returned to normal. Zhou Wen continued on his journey with his phone.

On the way, Zhou Wen paid close attention to the phone. Truth Listener’s ability was constantly paying attention to the interior of the phone, especially the battery. However, he didn’t discover anything amiss.

When he arrived at the next city, Zhou Wen stopped to rest again. His phone remained silent.

However, in the middle of the night, something abnormal happened. The phone that had been switched off, automatically switched on.

When the phone was switched on, an app automatically started playing the old movie. Zhou Wen had already seen this old movie in the hotel.

The problem is indeed there. Zhou Wen was now certain that something had happened at the hotel in the thunderstorm.

Zhou Wen switched off his phone again, but not long after, the phone automatically switched on again. It was still playing the old movies. Furthermore, no matter how long it played them, the phone’s battery didn’t decrease.

Zhou Wen switched it off a few times, but his phone would automatically switch on. Therefore, he decided not to turn it off.

Nothing happened to the phone until the morning.

Zhou Wen observed the battery in his phone the entire night. He could sense that there was a fluctuation in the battery, and it was extremely abnormal.

Could it be that the electric current is a special dimensional creature? Zhou Wen felt that the possibility was very high.

If the electric current inside was a Companion Beast, no one would use a Companion Beast like this. Although it created some trouble for him, it wasn’t fatal.

If his enemy had such a Companion Beast, they wouldn’t have used it in such a manner. It could definitely deal him a lethal blow and throw him into eternal damnation.

How can I get the electric current out? Zhou Wen looked at his phone and thought about how to confirm if there was a dimensional creature inside.
