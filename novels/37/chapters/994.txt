Li Xuan couldn’t help but be amused when he heard that. He glanced at Zhou Wen and said, “Benyi, your other dream is to meet Tai Sui?”

“That’s right. Tyrant Behemoth is our Federation’s hero, and so is Tai Sui. Furthermore, it’s the previous generation’s No. 1. I also want to see it with my own eyes, but I don’t know who its owner is. I got Dad to help me investigate for a long time, but I couldn’t find out who Tai Sui’s owner is,” Li Benyi said helplessly. “Indeed. A mysterious Companion Beast like Tai Sui must have a very powerful human master, an existence akin to the six heroes. It would be difficult to meet the owner even if I knew who he is, right?”

“It’s not difficult for you to meet Tai Sui. Just beg him,” Li Xuan said as he pointed at Zhou Wen.

“Why?” Li Benyi still didn’t understand.

“Because Tai Sui is also his Companion Beast. If he’s happy, you can even hug Tai Sui to sleep, much less look at it,” Li Xuan said.

Li Benyi gaped in disbelief as he looked at Zhou Wen, speechless. It was as though happiness had come too suddenly.

Tai Sui being his Companion Beast was no longer a secret. Many people around him knew about it, so there was no need for him to hide it. Zhou Wen decided to summon Tai Sui.

“It’s really Tai Sui... You actually have Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui at the same time... You’re really lucky...” Li Benyi’s eyes turned red from excitement.

“It’s alright. They aren’t easy to raise,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Can I hug it?” Li Benyi automatically ignored Zhou Wen’s words as he looked at Tai Sui—which resembled a white, bouncing ball—with glowing eyes.

“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded.

Li Benyi picked up Tai Sui with trembling hands. He felt like he was the happiest person in the world. In just one day, all his dreams were fulfilled.

Li Benyi suddenly thought of something and asked Zhou Wen excitedly, “Zhou Wen... No, no, no... Idol... You will get Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui to participate in the battle, right? You will defeat those Guardians, right?”

“I have things to do at the moment. I’m not sure if I can finish them in time. If I finish it before the one-month countdown, I might participate in the battle,” Zhou Wen said.

“I see. I hope you can quickly finish your matters. I really want to see Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui defeat those Guardians.” Although Li Benyi was somewhat disappointed, he still supported Zhou Wen. He only hoped that Zhou Wen could settle his matters before the ranking battle ended.

If an adult heard Zhou Wen’s explanation, they would think that it was just an excuse, but Li Benyi believed it.

“Alright,” Zhou Wen answered with a slight nod.

If he could advance to the Mythical stage before the Battle of Guardians ended, he indeed had plans to participate in the battle. Even if he couldn’t obtain first place, he could eliminate some Guardians.

Guardians would only become stronger. Just like Night Thearch’s Guardian, it was already at the Terror grade. Most of the newly contracted Guardians probably hadn’t reached the Terror grade. It was relatively easy to eliminate them now. In the future, the situation would only become more complicated.

However, it would probably be difficult to kill a Guardian like Night Thearch. Although Zhou Wen had the Ice Dragon King’s Terror item, it wasn’t easy to injure Night Thearch when he was on guard.

“Little Yi, you actually believe such a lame excuse? How naive.” A voice sounded from the door. Everyone turned their heads and saw a young man who was about the same age as Zhou Wen and company—or just slightly older—walk into the shop.

“Joseph, what are you doing here?” Li Benyi said unhappily when he saw the young man.

“To visit my brother and uncle, of course,” said Joseph indifferently.

“Who’s your brother? We don’t have that kind of relationship,” Li Benyi said.

“You’re still young and naive. I don’t blame you.” Joseph frowned slightly before turning to Li Benyu. “Uncle, have you considered the matter we discussed previously?”

Li Benyu pondered and said, “Joseph, you should know that the Companion Beast was specially prepared for Little Yi by the family head...”

“Uncle, Little Yi is still young. If he wants to contract a Mythical Companion Egg, he will have to wait at least a decade. You also know how fast the world changes. After more than a decade, Mythical Companion Eggs will no longer be worth anything. Lend me the Companion Egg now. You also know that I’ve already contracted a Guardian. With the help of a Mythical Companion Beast, it will be like adding wings to a tiger. Killing Mythical creatures will be as easy as flipping a hand. How many Mythical Companion Eggs do you want in the future? When Little Yi grows up, I’ll give him ten Mythical Companion Eggs...”

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan listened for a while and roughly understood what was going on. However, these family matters after all. The two of them didn’t know the details, so they didn’t say anything.

“Joseph, I’m really sorry. This Companion Egg is said to be for Joseph, but it’s actually the dowry that the family head gave to your aunt. The meaning is different. I can’t lend it to you,” Li Benyu said.

“Uncle, why haven’t you gotten your head out of the mud? You and Aunt have raised me since I was young, just like my biological parents. Now that I’ve contracted a Guardian, I have authority in the family. In the future, my authority will only grow. My parents are long dead, and you are my only family. In the future, not only will I take care of you and Aunt, but Little Yi will also have me to take care of in the future. Won’t he have all the best resources when that happens? Now that I have the ability, I’ll repay you in the future. You also know that I’ve just contracted a Guardian and haven’t had the time to obtain a Mythical Companion Beast. If you help me now, it will be helping your own family...” Joseph continued persuading.

“I really can’t help you with this matter. Furthermore, we adopted you back then only because your mother is my wife’s sister. We didn’t expect you to repay us. We just want you to live well,” Li Benyu said.

Joseph’s expression became a little nasty. “Uncle, let’s talk about this later. You have to discuss it with my aunt after all. She should understand that this is a good thing for our family.”

“Then wait for her to come back. I still have guests to entertain, so I won’t keep you,” Li Benyu said.

Joseph glanced at Zhou Wen and curled his lips in disdain. “Zhou Wen, right? I heard that your Companion Beasts are very strong? Unfortunately, the era of Companion Beasts is over. In the future, it will be the Guardian’s world. It’s useless having so many Companion Beasts.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Li Xuan couldn’t stand it any longer as he quipped, “It may be useless, but it isn’t stopping you from shamelessly requesting one.”

Joseph’s expression turned ugly. Before he could flare up, Li Benyu said, “Gentlemen, the family head is still waiting to meet you. I’ll take you there.”

With that said, Li Benyu pulled Li Benyi along with him and left the shop with Zhou Wen and Li Xuan.
