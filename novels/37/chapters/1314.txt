Chapter 1315: Returning to the Fiend Tomb

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen attempted to enter that state again when back in his room.

In that state, he could directly hear the inner voice and even turn it into an image. As long as he had that ability, he might be able to figure out the truth from the Zhang family.

However, it was unknown if Truth Listener’s ability hadn’t truly reached that stage or if Zhou Wen’s strength wasn’t enough to match Truth Listener’s. In any case, he tried many times, but failed to enter that state again.

However, ever since he heard the inner voice, Zhou Wen’s ability to capture sounds improved significantly. Distance, proximity, and amplitude weren’t a problem for Zhou Wen. As long as he found the right channel, no matter how far away he was or how soft the voice was, Zhou Wen could hear it clearly on Earth even if someone was whispering on Venus.

Since he couldn’t accomplish telepathy, Zhou Wen wanted to see if he could find the Zhang family’s voice channel and eavesdrop on them. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

This clearly wasn’t an easy task. When facing each other, Zhou Wen wasn’t able to accurately capture the sound. Furthermore, there were so many people in the Zhang family. Zhou Wen didn’t know which person’s words were useful, so it was easy to miss them.

With no other choice, Zhou Wen could only slowly try. After all, he had to practice controlling his hearing, so he just treated it as practice.

After listening for a long time, he occasionally heard some of the Zhang family’s conversations. They were just a few sentences, and some of them were just a few words. He didn’t discover anything useful.

Zhou Wen could only continue practicing. He realized that ever since he heard Zhang Yuzhi’s thoughts, his control over the sound he received had become stronger. He improved very quickly.

Outside the building, Eldest Uncle Zhang coughed and said, “Yuzhi, are you sleeping?”

“Uncle, what’s the matter?” Zhang Yuzhi opened the door and asked Eldest Uncle Zhang in puzzlement.

“Nothing much. I just feel uncomfortable and want to chat with you,” Uncle Zhang said.

“Uncle, have a seat. I’ll pour you a cup of tea.” As Zhang Yuzhi spoke, she prepared to get the teapot.

“There’s no need. I’ll do it myself.” Eldest Uncle Zhang picked up the teapot and poured himself a cup, but he didn’t drink it.

Putting down the teapot, he sighed and said, “Yuzhi, it was really hard on you. If there was another way, we wouldn’t have agreed to her conditions. If it’s possible, I’d rather go in your stead. After all, I’m already old and useless. You are still young and talented. The Zhang family is still counting on you for the future.”

“Uncle, there’s no need to say anything. This is my life. I accept my fate. What she wants is me. I won’t implicate the family,” Zhang Yuzhi said with her head lowered.

“What do you mean by implicating? We are family,” Eldest Uncle Zhang said. “I only hate myself for being useless. I can’t replace you, nor can I save the Zhang family. Yuzhi, if you need anything, just tell me. Even if I have to risk my life, I will definitely help you complete it.”

“Thank you, Uncle. I’m fine now. I don’t have any other needs.” Zhang Yuzhi shook her head.

“That’s fine. Just tell Uncle when you think of it.” Eldest Uncle Zhang paused and said excitedly, “Yuzhi, you know that this matter concerns the life and death of our clan. Nothing must go wrong. If anything happens, it’s fine for us old fellows to die. If something happens to Chunqiu and company, how can I answer to my ancestors in the netherworld? How can I face my ancestors…”

“Uncle, did something happen?” Zhang Yuzhi couldn’t help but frown when she heard Zhang Chunqiu’s name.

…

“What are you still doing here?” The next morning, just as Zhou Wen opened the door, he saw Zhang Yuzhi standing outside. It was unknown when she had arrived.

“What?” Zhou Wen looked at Zhang Yuzhi in puzzlement with a blank expression.

“I already told you to leave. Don’t stay here and annoy me. Why don’t you understand human language?” Zhang Yuzhi said again.

Zhou Wen dug his ears and said helplessly, “My hearing is getting worse. What did you say?”

Zhang Yuzhi didn’t say a word as she pulled Zhou Wen’s hand and walked out. It looked like she wanted to forcefully pull him out of the Zhang family residence.

Seeing that Zhang Yuzhi was serious, Zhou Wen knew it was pointless to feign ignorance. He couldn’t just shake off Zhang Yuzhi’s hand and just insist on staying. He couldn’t bring himself to do such a thing.

Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over what to do, he suddenly realized that the sea of noises around him was gradually receding. He had once again entered a state where he could hear one’s inner thoughts.

I knew it. It was definitely not an illusion. Truth Listener’s power can really hear one’s inner thoughts.?Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly listened, hoping to know what he could hear.

This time, Zhou Wen didn’t sense Zhang Yuzhi turn into a girl. She was still the same, but Zhou Wen heard two voices from her.

A voice came from her mouth. Zhou Wen could hear it, but he didn’t seem to remember it.

Another voice came from her. It was weak at first, but it later became clearer.

“Zhou Wen, leave. Don’t ever come back. Staying here will only harm you. I don’t wish to harm my friends again… I’m not worthy of being your friend either…” Zhou Wen’s expression turned odder as he listened.

“Quickly return. Stop fooling around.” Zhang Yuzhi pulled Zhou Wen out of the door and gritted her teeth. With that said, she turned around and returned. The Zhang family guards closed the door.

Zhou Wen looked at the tightly shut door and turned to leave.

When the Zhang family saw Zhou Wen really leave, many people heaved a sigh of relief.

They weren’t afraid of Zhou Wen, but they were afraid that he would interfere with their matters.

Zhang Chunqiu stood beside a stone pavilion and looked at Zhang Yuzhi who was sitting numbly in the garden. He couldn’t help but sigh.

…

Two days later, many people from the Zhang family were nervous. Many people left the Zhang family residence and headed for the Fiend Tomb.

At noon, a car was pushed out of the Zhang family residence.

The reason it was said to be pushed out wasn’t because the car was out of gas, but because it was a wooden carriage.

The wooden carriage’s design was very strange. Even the axle and wheels were made of wood. There was a white cloth that resembled a bed curtain covering the carriage. It was impossible to see inside.

If one could see through the white cloth, they would see that there was a black wooden coffin inside and many yellow paper talismans stuck to the coffin.

Under the protection of the Zhang family, the wooden carriage with the coffin was pushed all the way to the Fiend Tomb.
