Chapter 1444: Way to Use the Death Harbinger Crow

Harbinger crows only spelled sorrow, never anything good. They were diametrically opposite to magpies.

However, the Death Harbinger Crow’s ability was very useful. Zhou Wen had been thinking of a way to raise its level.

Unfortunately, it didn’t have an Evolvable attribute. Zhou Wen thought of many ways, but he couldn’t raise its level even by one. He probably had to rely on a Samsara Stone to advance it to a higher level in the future.

The drop rate of Samsara Stones was unfortunately just too low. Zhou Wen had only had one drop up to now, but he had already used it.

However, even if it hadn’t advanced, it still looked useful. Zhou Wen had summoned it to see if its abilities were useful.

Zhou Wen knew that this fellow was of some use when he heard its caw.

What puzzled Zhou Wen was that the Death Harbinger Crow wasn’t cawing at the thing that was charging at him. It was clearly cawing in the direction of the other flower trees.

Strange, by calling it a Death Harbinger Crow, it’s clearly telling me that this thing shouldn’t be a threat. However, from the way it looks, it doesn’t look like it poses zero threat.?Zhou Wen shot a few more times and riddled the petals around the thing with holes, but he still failed to stop it.

Zhou Wen was considering whether he should retreat just as the thing arrived in front of him. It suddenly plopped down and lunged over in front of him.

After it fell, the petals outside automatically fell off, revealing what was inside.

The fiery-red glow nearly blinded them. They widened their eyes. Inside was a gorgeous golden-red robe, and it was feminine.

“Could this be the robe that the gods gave to Pandora according to legends? There are legends that the robe was given to Pandora by the Goddess of Wisdom, and there are also legends that the Fire God gave it to her. From the looks of this robe, the possibility of it being the Fire God is higher…” Su Yi was indeed a news reporter. She immediately thought of what it was.

Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, the robe automatically flew up and floated towards him.

Zhou Wen reached out and caught it. The robe landed on his arm before transforming into thousands of fire threads that fused into his body. They formed a flaming golden tattoo on his body before gradually disappearing.

“Old Zhou, are you alright?” Li Xuan hurriedly asked.

“I’m fine. This thing seems to be a Companion Beast!” Zhou Wen sensed the information and nearly laughed out loud.

That thing was called the Fire God Golden Silk Robe. It was actually a Calamity-grade Companion Beast.

Li Xuan wanted to ask what level it was, but when he glanced at Liu Yun and Su Yi, he swallowed the words he was about to say.

Liu Yun’s mind raced as he immediately rushed towards one of the flower trees without any hesitation.

Now, anyone could tell that the flowers on the flower trees were likely treasures that the gods had given to Pandora. Whatever he grabbed was profit.

“Liu Yun, don’t do anything rash.” Li Xuan reacted and wanted to stop Liu Yun, but it was too late.

Although Li Xuan’s movement technique wasn’t bad, it was much weaker than Liu Yun’s instant transmission.

Liu Yun had already arrived in front of a flower tree while Li Xuan shouted. As he reached out to grab the flower, he said, “The items have been found. It’s up to your own abilities. Finders keepers!”

Liu Yun was afraid that Zhou Wen would not distribute it fairly. He was alone, and Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were two people. Wouldn’t that mean that two-thirds of the goods would be taken? He might as well strike first to gain the upper hand and take as much as he could.

With his godly thieving skills, even Zhou Wen might not be able to out-snatch him. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Old Zhou, quickly stop him. This fellow is very fast. He’ll snatch everything!” Li Xuan said anxiously.

“There’s no rush. Let’s wait and see.” Zhou Wen had no intention of stopping him.

This was because the flower that Liu Yun touched was one of the flowers that the Death Harbinger Crow cawed at.

Zhou Wen wanted to know if the Death Harbinger Crow’s cawing was accurate. However, Zhou Wen secretly condensed the power of Human Sovereign. If Liu Yun really encountered danger, he had to help him.

Liu Yun’s face was filled with excitement as he reached into the flower to grab the treasure. However, just as his palm reached in, he suddenly let out a strange cry and retracted his palm.

Liu Yun’s retracted hand had completely turned black. It was as though it was dyed with ink. Black gas was still emitting from it. No matter how Liu Yun shook it, the black gas couldn’t be shaken off.

The black gas over Liu Yun’s hand rapidly decreased, but it wasn’t eliminated. Instead, it seeped into Liu Yun’s body.

The black gas in Liu Yun’s hand vanished in moments, but his forehead darkened, as though it was enveloped by dark clouds.

“Eldest Senior Brother, are you alright?” Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun’s forehead and found it familiar.

“Holy sh*t, this is a curse! That’s not right. Why did you get a Fire God Robe while I got a curse!” Liu Yun looked at his face in the mirror and immediately, his face turned livid as he screamed.

“Eldest Senior Brother, everything is fated in life. Don’t force it. This item isn’t destined to be yours,” Zhou Wen said as he shot at another flower.

After the flower was hit, it spewed out white gas and quickly shriveled. However, it didn’t take human form this time. After it dried up, it turned into a ribbon.

The flower fell from the tree and automatically flew in front of Zhou Wen. The withered petals on it dropped as a headband floated towards Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen reached out and grabbed the headband. It automatically landed in his hand before transforming into threads of light that fused into Zhou Wen’s body, forming a new tattoo.

Another Calamity-grade Companion Beast. Don’t tell me this place is filled with Calamity-grade Companion Beasts??Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised when he sensed the information from the headband.

If they were all Calamity-grade Companion Beasts, he would really be rich.

I see. It cannot be taken by hand… I understand…?Liu Yun’s nose bled from the curse. He summoned a dart and shot it at one of the flowers.

Zhou Wen originally thought that since he had agreed to split it 50-50, he couldn’t let Eldest Senior Brother return empty-handed. He would let him take whatever he could.

It was unknown if it was because of the previous curse or if Liu Yun’s luck wasn’t good. His dart actually hit a flower tree that the Death Harbinger Crow had called out to.

Pfft!

The flower was penetrated by the dart. Indeed, just like Zhou Wen’s two attempts, the flower withered and automatically fell, flying towards Liu Yun.

Just as Liu Yun was about to grab the treasure, he saw a gray gas fly out and envelop his head. It was so fast that he couldn’t dodge in time.

Liu Yun’s forehead was black to begin with, but now his entire face turned gray. He looked almost no different from a corpse that was about to be buried.
