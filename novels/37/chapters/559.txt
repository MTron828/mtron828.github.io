Chapter 560 Unexpected Discovery

After hanging up, Zhou Wen left Luoyang and rode a Chi towards Zhuolu.

He had been to Zhuolu before, so naturally, he still remembered the way. However, compared to the last trip, the probability of seeing people outside the city was lower.

Many of the roads were already abandoned and lush vegetation could be seen everywhere.

Unless there was a large convoy or a pet transport team passing by, it would be hard to see a lone traveler.

On the way, Zhou Wen encountered some break-out creatures. Although they weren’t very strong—at the Legendary stage—it made him even more uneasy.

As the level for break-out creatures dropped, it was very likely that the dimensional zones’ seals would weaken further. Wang Mingyuan had said that in another ten years, the dimensional zones would completely have their seals released. From the looks of it, it wasn’t a lie.

The Chi’s speed was rather fast. Although it wasn’t as comfortable as sitting in a car, it could traverse complicated terrain, unlike cars that were easily restricted.

Many roads were destroyed by dimensional creatures. It was getting harder and harder to drive outside the city.

There were also many vines and plants that covered the roads. Other than some roads that often had cars drive through them, it was hard to guarantee smooth-flowing roads.

Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of exhaustion as he traveled day and night. On the third day, he set up a tent and planned on sleeping for a while.

Although he was full of energy and had endless Essence Energy, a person’s body and mind wouldn’t feel good if they did not sleep for prolonged periods.

The path Zhou Wen took wasn’t one visited by convoys, so there weren’t many people around. Furthermore, this was a mountain path in the mountainous area, so the chances of encountering people were even lower.

Zhou Wen set up a tent on a platform by the side of the road. It just so happened that the area was empty. Beside it was a cliff without any obstructions. If any foreign creature appeared, it could be discovered ahead of time.

He summoned Six-Winged, Banana Fairy, Doctor Darkness, and other Companion Beasts and got them to guard him. Only then did Zhou Wen feel at ease to fall asleep.

At midnight, Zhou Wen was sleeping soundly when he was suddenly awoken by a pair of tiny hands.

Opening her eyes, he saw Banana Fairy patting his face with her tiny hands. Upon seeing Zhou Wen wake up, Banana Fairy pulled his hand and pointed outside the tent.

“What happened?” Zhou Wen asked Banana Fairy.

Banana Fairy spoke, but he couldn’t understand what she was saying. It left Zhou Wen somewhat depressed. After all, she was a Mythical pet. It had been so long, yet she couldn’t even learn simple human language.

Zhou Wen could only get up and leave the tent. Six-Winged was sleeping outside the tent, sleeping even more soundly than Zhou Wen.

Doctor Darkness stood at the entrance of the tent without any expression, as though he was in a daze.

These two fellows aren’t reliable when compared to Banana Fairy, Zhou Wen thought to himself.

Banana Fairy flew in the air with her banana leaf and pointed at the bottom of the cliff. She made a series of sounds as though she wanted to tell Zhou Wen something.

Zhou Wen walked to the edge of the cliff and looked down. With the help of the moonlight’s illumination, he saw something glowing in the forest below.

The flickering light looked very regular. It didn’t look like fireflies. Firstly, fireflies weren’t that bright. Secondly, Zhou Wen had never heard of a firefly being able to emit red light.

Looking at it from above, it felt like a red alert alarm was flashing under it.

What’s down there? A dimensional creature? Although Zhou Wen’s eyesight was good, he couldn’t see what was glowing red from so far away.

Banana Fairy pulled Zhou Wen and flew down as though she wanted him to follow her down.

Zhou Wen hurriedly pulled Banana Fairy. The world was too terrifying. Many unknown things could cause people to die without knowing why. It wasn’t that Zhou Wen wasn’t curious, but he couldn’t risk his life out of curiosity.

After grabbing Banana Fairy, Zhou Wen summoned more than ten Poison Bats and made them fly down to take a look.

The dozen or so poison bats quickly flew to the forest below the cliff and tore apart the trees and vines, making the red light even clearer.

Zhou Wen switched to Eight Perfections Wisdom and enhanced his vision. He could vaguely see that there seemed to be a red object glowing underground. As it was buried in the soil, only a tiny portion of it could be seen. Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what it was.

He ordered the Poison Bats to dig up the soil near that object. They lay on the ground, their claws piercing into the soil covered by fallen leaves as they dug up the soil.

Seeing that the object didn’t have any reaction, Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. However, he didn’t dare to be careless. He kept staring at the object and the Poison Bats. Once the Poison Bats had any abnormal reaction, he could immediately react.

Thankfully, the situation that Zhou Wen had expected didn’t happen. After digging for a short while, the Poison Bats had dug out a huge hole.

However, from above, he could only see a red ball that was more than four meters in diameter. It was shining brightly, but he could not tell what it was.

Before confirming what it was, Zhou Wen didn’t dare let the Poison Bat touch it. After some thought, he put away the tent and other things. Then, he got Six-Winged to fly down the cliff with him.

Looking from the side, it was really a huge ball. It looked like a piece of jade that was half-buried in the soil. The blinking light in it was constantly changing, sometimes strong, sometimes weak. That was why from afar, it looked like it was flickering. In fact, it was constantly glowing.

A dimensional creature? It doesn’t look like it. A Companion Egg doesn’t seem like it either. What is it? Zhou Wen sized it up but couldn’t tell what it was.

Banana Fairy couldn’t help but fly above the red ball. Then, she jumped down from the banana leaf and landed on the red ball.

She jumped on the red ball a few times, then with a pop, the red ball cracked.

Zhou Wen jumped in fright. It was already too late to stop her. Thankfully, there wasn’t any danger after the red ball split open. The red ball turned into a flower.

The jade-like outer shell was actually its petals. After peeling open layer by layer, the pink pistil inside was revealed, and the glowing object was the pistil.

The moment the flower bloomed, Zhou Wen immediately smelled a rich floral fragrance. With the augmentation of the Eight Perfections Wisdom, he felt that the fragrance was refreshing, one that relaxed his mind.

Banana Fairy had already landed in the pistil. Her tiny hand grabbed some pollen and placed it in her mouth, as though she was eating cotton candy. She quickly swallowed it.

There was a lot of pollen in the flower. After Banana Fairy ate one blob, she grabbed another with both hands. She stuffed it into her mouth and stuffed her cheeks.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
