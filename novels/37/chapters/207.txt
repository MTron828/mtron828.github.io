Chapter 208 Sun God Temple

Everyone was astonished. Even among the six hero families, Pros was rather famous. It was truly shocking that he had been defeated by Li Xuan.

“Isn’t that Thundergod General? The one he bought at the trading market actually had the Thundergod Augmentation skill. How lucky.” Immediately, someone recognized the Thundergod Sword in Li Xuan’s hand.

“He’s really lucky. He bought a Thundergod General with Thundergod Augmentation for only two million. This punk is really lucky,” someone said jealously.

Back at the trading market, Li Xuan’s spending of two million to buy a Thundergod Companion Egg had made him the target of mockery. It was a Companion Egg that could be bought for four to five hundred thousand outside; yet, he chose to spend two million here. It was an act of a fool.

However, when they saw Thundergod General with Thundergod Augmentation, many of them turned green with envy.

The Thundergod General was the best offensive pet among Legendaries. Even a fellow like Pros, who was adept at lightning-elemental forces, suffered quite a bit.

“So Pros, who claims to be the son of lightning, is nothing much after all. He can’t even defeat the lightning forces of a Companion Beast. How disappointing.” Li Xuan wanted to infuriate Pros and make him fight him alone. That way, he could delay things.

“Pros, he’s deliberately trying to provoke you to stall for time,” Xia Bing said.

Pros nodded slightly as lightning flickered in his golden pupils. He stared at Li Xuan and said, “You’ve successfully provoked me, so die.”

However, he wasn’t the only one who made a move. A few members of the six hero families attacked Li Xuan in a bid to finish him off in the fastest time possible before destroying Zhou Wen’s trial.

“I’ve been unknown for sixteen years. Today, I’m fighting the masses with one sword. I don’t seek a place in history, only an eternal name.” Li Xuan held the Thundergod Sword in hand and stood proudly in front of the Sun God Temple. This was the first time he had looked this serious.

The sword struck out like lightning, causing ripples to form as it surged towards the attacks of his assailants.

When Zhou Wen walked into the temple, he originally thought of it as merely a palace, but after entering it, he realized that the inside of the temple was a void.

In this void, there was a sun hanging high above. It emitted an extremely resplendent divine light, as though it was the center of this empty universe.

At Zhou Wen’s feet were a stone staircase floating in the void, one that extended towards the sun.

“Path seeker, step on the stone steps and walk towards the sun. The closer you are to the sun, the more likely it is for you to obtain the God of the Sun’s power.” An ethereal voice sounded in the void.

Zhou Wen didn’t sense any abnormal reaction from the Sigh of the King as he walked towards the stone steps ahead. After taking a few steps, he felt the temperature around him increase significantly.

The temperature had risen quickly. After walking more than ten steps, Zhou Wen felt as though he had walked into a furnace.

On the other hand, the chick on his shoulder looked like it was enjoying itself as if this heat made it very comfortable.

Before Zhou Wen entered the hall, he had switched the Primordial Energy Art to the Ancient Imperial Sutra. The Ancient Imperial Sutra also seemed to have a portion of the power of fire, but it was completely different from the power of the Sun God Temple.

Zhou Wen originally believed that Ancient Imperial Sutra’s powers of a similar trait would allow him to take advantage of the situation, but now, he realized that that wasn’t the case. Despite using all his strength to resist the sun’s mighty splendor, he was already covered in sweat after taking about twenty steps. If he continued walking another ten steps, he might end up dehydrated by the sun.

With no other choice, Zhou Wen had no choice but to activate his Lotus Flower Buddha Body Primordial Energy Skill to resist the Sun God’s splendor. But even so, he only managed to take a few more steps; he was still a long way from the sun in the void.

From the looks of it, ordinary people can’t withstand the power of the Sun God Temple. Unless they cultivate in a corresponding Primordial Energy Art and receive the recognition of the temple; otherwise, even an Epic expert wouldn’t be able to walk to the front of the sun. Zhou Wen already had the intention to retreat.

He was only here to seek out a way to break through, not to risk his life. Since he knew that there was no possibility, there was no need to continue.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to retreat, the Ancient Imperial Sutra inside him automatically changed back into the Lost Immortal Sutra. The Lost Immortal Sutra slowly circulated as the originally ethereal Lost Immortal Sutra gradually turned warm.

As the Lost Immortal Sutra heated up his Primordial Energy, the Sun God’s splendor around Zhou Wen’s body no longer seemed to be as hot as before. Zhou Wen immediately felt energized.

The Lost Immortal Sutra has finally shown its effects. Could it be that there’s hope of advancing this time? Zhou Wen was delighted as he dispelled the thought of retreating and continued proceeding.

After the Lost Immortal Sutra showed its effects, the effects of the Sun God’s splendor on him grew less and less. When it shone on Zhou Wen, he found it comfortably warm. It wasn’t anything like the scorching heat from before.

If I were to cultivate in the Sun Strafe Art, the effect would probably be like this if I came to the Sun God Temple, right? Zhou Wen thought to himself as he walked towards the sun.

The sun that seemed to be far away also seemed to become much closer. With every step Zhou Wen took, he could sense that he was rapidly approaching the sun.

How is this a test? It’s clearly a selection. Those who are selected by the temple would be able to get close with a casual stroll, but those who aren’t selected will not be able to succeed no matter how hard they try. If not for the fact that the Lost Immortal Sutra is able to fool the terrifying existence here, even if I had advanced to the Epic stage, I wouldn’t have been able to reach the sun. Indeed, nothing in the world is fair. It’s the same for the miraculous Sun God Temple.

As he pondered, Zhou Wen was getting closer and closer to the sun. The sun was no longer as blinding as before, allowing him to see it clearly. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

It turned out that it wasn’t a sun, but a golden seed. It looked like a pine nut, and its entire body was like a golden crystal.

The seed emitted light and heat, making it look like a sun.

Zhou Wen glanced at the chick on his shoulder and was surprised to see it still looking relaxed. It didn’t seem to be affected by the sun’s temperature at all.

He had the Lost Immortal Sutra that played the role of confusing the Sun God Temple’s mechanism; therefore, he wasn’t suppressed by the power of the Sun God Temple. This was how he had managed to reach this point.

However, the chick didn’t have the Lost Immortal Sutra. The fact that it relied on its body to withstand the forces made it rather terrifying

I wonder what level this chick’s mother is. From its appearance, it’s unlikely that its mother is as simple as an Epic creature. Zhou Wen proceeded forward step by step, approaching the seed without suffering any effects.

Finally, when Zhou Wen was on the last stone step, the seed floated inches away from him. All he needed to do was stretch out his hand to obtain the sun-like seed.
