Chapter 1613: What happened to Brotherhood?

Translator: CKtalon

“Shatter!” With Zhou Wen’s roar, the lightning struck down.

At the same time, a beam streaked across the sky. It resonated at the exact moment Zhou Wen roared as though it was a miracle responding to him.

Boom!

Void lightning struck the teleportation nexus’s cornerstone. Lightning flowed through the cracks, making the cornerstone look like a stone pillar covered in lightning cracks.

Although it looked like it was about to shatter, it didn’t.

However, the beam that accompanied Zhou Wen’s voice struck the cornerstone. The stone pillar that was filled with cracks from the lightning’s invasion suddenly exploded. Light and lightning spewed out from within like huge exploding lightning fireworks.

Boom!

The huge teleportation nexus’s cornerstone was like a collapsed building. The entire foundation cornerstone shattered into pieces and collapsed. One could sense the terrifying shockwave from as far as 500 kilometers away.

It felt like an earthquake a few hundred kilometers away from the teleportation nexus. The ground churned like waves as rifts opened up on the ground. They crisscrossed like huge spiderwebs.

The barren land instantly turned into ruins.

Looking at the crumbling cornerstone, everyone’s mouths gaped open. There was excitement, anger, doubt, and even more horror.

Holy God stared intently at Zhou Wen and pursed his lips without making a sound. However, the glint in his eyes was chilling.

“What was that beam of light?”

“Could it be that a deity heard Egg Sovereign’s voice and responded to him with a miracle?”

“This is a miracle! Could it be that my Egg Sovereign is a person chosen by the heavens? Even the heavens are helping him.”

Ordinary people really couldn’t think of any creature that could produce such a powerful beam. They believed that it was a miracle.

As for the various factions that were more concerned about the An family, they had already guessed what the beam was.

The An family had shocked the entire Federation when it destroyed Skysplit Tower, but they had never used that terrifying weapon again.

After such a long time, when the forgetful humans were about to forget that terrifying weapon, it revealed its ferociousness again today. The shock it produced was even more direct than before.

‘The Void Salamander’s powerful strength failed to collapse the cornerstone despite bombarding it so many times. However, this single shot shattered it.

‘With such a strong comparison, the shock dealt to the heart was incomparable to the previous time.

Up to now, many people had yet to recover from their shock. This shot was just too shocking.

In fact, this shot wasn’t as terrifying as people imagined. The void lightning had almost destroyed the cornerstone. Cracks had already appeared in its interior, but it was just short of a final push.

It was like the straw that broke the camel’s back. Without this straw, the camel could still last for a period of time, but once this straw was placed on it, the camel would immediately collapse.

Of course, this was only an analogy. The effects of this shot were far stronger than a piece of straw. Its destructive power was no weaker than the void lightning, It produced such an effect by working in concert with the void lightning. Neither was indispensable.

On a mountaintop a few hundred kilometers away from the Holy Land, An Sheng was instructing people to dismantle and distribute the Essence Energy compression accelerator before returning with the parts. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

An Sheng didn’t know how this thing was brought there. Before Old K and company appeared, the accelerator had been in Luoyang’s An family. It was impossible to transport such a huge accelerator here in such a short period of time unless one had powerful spatial powers.

Zhou Wen was likely the only spatial expert in the An family capable of this feat. However, Zhou Wen had been fighting all this while, so it was impossible for him to do such a thing.

Furthermore, with An Tianzuo’s temper, it was impossible for him to request Zhou Wen’s help.

An Sheng had some guesses, but he buried them in his heart forever. He didn’t even think about it.

“Retreat!” Zhou Wen had already achieved his goal and wasn’t willing to stay any longer. He wanted to get Zhong Ziya and company to retreat quickly. There was no benefit in continuing the battle, much less truly storming into the Holy Land.

However, when he spoke and looked into the sky, he realized that Immortal’s body had already transformed into countless petals. By the time the petals scattered, he had already vanished.

Zhong Ziya only left his avatar on the battlefield. His true body rode his sword and instantly vanished like a meteor.

“What happened to brotherhood?” Zhou Wen’s mouth gaped open for a while.

The only tragic one was Liu Yun. His movement technique and escaping abilities were originally the strongest among the three, but he ended up being entangled by Xiao. They were both spatial experts, so Xiao didn’t give him a chance to use spatial teleportation to escape.

After all, Liu Yun was good at close-range instant transmission. Long-distance teleportation wasn’t his forte. He was much weaker than Zhou Wen and needed plenty of time to prepare. Under Xiao’s attacks, there was no time to use long-distance teleportation.

In terms of movement techniques, Xiao’s Trajectory movement technique was even stranger. Furthermore, Xiao was proficient in all sorts of different techniques. He forcefully intercepted Liu Yun.

Liu Yun was half-dead. He barely survived to this moment thanks to the Taiji Symbol. Zhou Wen guessed that Jing Daoxian had most likely helped him obtain the Taiji Symbol.

Bang!

‘When Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun, he saw Xiao palm strike Liu Yun in the chest. Liu Yun’s sternum caved in as he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Along with the blood spewed out was the Holy Artifact ring that Liu Yun had swallowed in battle.

Xiao reached out to grab the Holy Artifact ring and put it on his finger. His palm didn’t stop; it struck Liu Yun’s head again.

Liu Yun had nowhere to hide. The armor on his body had long shattered and was unable to provide any protection. If Xiao’s palm, augmented by the Holy Artifact, struck him, his entire head would explode.

Bang!

Xiao’s palm struck down, but it didn’t land on Liu Yun, but the Chaos Egg. The Chaos Egg blocked Xiao’s terrifying palm.

“Junior Brother… You’re finally here…” Liu Yun, who had been beaten to a pulp, was so excited that he was about to cry.

“Leave now. Leave this to me,” Zhou Wen said.

In fact, there was no need for Zhou Wen to say anything. Liu Yun had already instant transmitted away.

Once Liu Yun left, the surrounding space immediately distorted and fault lines appeared after losing the Taiji Symbol’s domain’s restraint on the Trajectory domain. Old K and Jiuyang also surrounded him.

“Holy sh*t, why did everyone leave? They left Egg Sovereign alone?”

“Aren’t they fellow disciples? Isn’t it all about brothers who never abandon each other?”

“Te already said that even brothers can’t be relied on, much less fellow disciples.”

“They escaped way too quickly!”

“That’s quite a sucky situation to be in.. If they escape, leaving Egg Sovereign behind, what will happen to him?
