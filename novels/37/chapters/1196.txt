Chapter 1197: Mustard Fruits

The stone quickly flew close to a fruit. Just as it was about to approach the fruit, it suddenly vanished, similar to when Zhou Wen used teleportation.

The antelope didn’t lie to me this time. The Mustard Fruit is indeed spatial in nature. There’s a huge space inside. The mark Zhou Wen left on the stone still existed. He could sense that the stone had been teleported to a special space.

I wonder if it will work! Zhou Wen could still sense the spatial label on the stone. He planned on trying the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique, but he didn’t know if he could succeed under the present circumstances. After all, the stone had been sent into another space. It was difficult to say if the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art would work. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Clown Mask that represented the Godfiend Era and the Singularity Universe that represented the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art circulated at the same time, producing a strange resonance. Zhou Wen sensed the spatial label on the stone and used the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique.

This technique combined two spatial Terror powers. The instant he used it, Zhou Wen found the fruit undergoing a strange change.

The Mustard Fruit that was originally growing on the tree branch, suddenly turned into a fist-sized stone. In the next second, the stone shattered and the Mustard Fruit dropped.

Zhou Wen was overjoyed—he had succeeded. He had exchanged the Mustard Fruit with the stone in the Mustard Space. As there was no space in the stone, the Mustard Fruit naturally dropped.

However, the Mustard Fruit had already left the Mustard Tree. Without an energy supply, the spatial powers within the Mustard Fruit clearly became weaker.

Before Zhou Wen could catch the Mustard Fruit, Chick rushed out excitedly. Like a golden bolt of lightning, it swallowed the Mustard Fruit in midair.

After Chick swallowed the Mustard Fruit, it suddenly vanished. However, it immediately appeared in another place before disappearing again. It was elsewhere when it appeared again.

Chick seemed to constantly teleport as its figure blinked in and out of existence. It took a while before it gradually stabilized.

Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Chick slowly return to normal. He picked up another stone and used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to get another Mustard Fruit.

Chick was very greedy as it flew over and swallowed the second Mustard Fruit. This time, its figure shimmered even more as it constantly vanished and appeared in different spots.

It lasted longer this time. Chick didn’t completely return to normal. Even if it stood there motionless, its figure would suddenly vanish before suddenly appearing again.

“Oh no, a terrifying fellow is coming. Quickly pluck the third fruit.” The antelope suddenly made a sound and didn’t write on the ground. Its expression turned extremely solemn.

Zhou Wen also felt that something was amiss. He saw dark clouds billowing over the mountain, instantly darkening the world as though it was doomsday.

Almost at the same time, a beam of light tore through the dark clouds. It illuminated the area where Zhou Wen and company were.

The light was too fast. Before Zhou Wen could pluck the third fruit, the light had already scattered, brightly illuminating the area.

“Paradise Domain... F*ck you... I’m not done with life... I don’t want to go to the Western Paradise...” The antelope cried out as a third vertical eye at its glabella suddenly opened. Its entire body emitted a crackling sound.

Originally, the antelope was thin and weak, making it look like a malnourished antelope, but at that instant, its body became as strong as a bull. The horns on its head were snow-white and crystalline like curved blades. A sanguine glow spewed out from its vertical eye, turning into a blood-colored barrier that enveloped the nearby area.

Boom!

The brilliance collided with the sanguine barrier. The latter quaked and abruptly shrank. However, it ultimately resisted the terrifying beam and prevented it from descending.

At that moment, Zhou Wen had already used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to remove the last Mustard Fruit.

However, Chick was still constantly shuttling through space. It couldn’t control its body. It tried flying towards the third fruit, but as it flew, it involuntarily entered a spatial teleportation state. When it appeared again, it was somewhere else.

After several attempts, Chick failed to approach the falling Mustard Fruit.

“What are you waiting for? Quickly take the fruit and run. When that fellow comes down, we will all be doomed,” the antelope cried out.

Blood tears were already flowing out of its vertical eye. The eye looked like it was about to crack open. The sanguine barrier quaked as it shrank, as though it would shatter at any moment.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen teleported over and grabbed the falling Mustard Fruit. Then, he went over to grab Chick, hoping to take it away.

However, just as he grabbed Chick, Chick’s body automatically tore through space and vanished from Zhou Wen’s hand, appearing elsewhere.

Zhou Wen realized things were going south. Chick’s situation was too unstable, so it was impossible for him to grab it and escape. He made a prompt decision and took out the Chaos Bead.

When Chick phased into existence again, Zhou Wen stuffed it into the Chaos Bead’s space and stuffed the remaining Mustard Fruit inside.

After confirming that Chick hadn’t tunneled out of it, Zhou Wen fled down the mountain at full speed.

Seeing that Zhou Wen had succeeded, the antelope turned around and ran. It ran much faster than him and overtook him in moments.

Rumble!

However, the brilliance kept targeting the antelope. Furthermore, it became more and more resplendent. It blasted the antelope’s sanguine barrier. It kept crackling and fractures appeared. The brilliance was seeping in.

Struck by such a heavy blow, blood spewed out of the antelope’s vertical eye. Its eyeball was about to burst.

“F*ck you. Do you really think I have nothing?” The antelope cursed and suddenly opened its mouth to spit something out. At the same time, it shouted, “Supreme Venerable Sovereign, be quick, as if this were a command! Seal...”

Upon saying the sutra, the antelope spat out another mouthful of blood on the thing it had spat out previously.

It was a yellow paper talisman. After the blood spewed out, the yellow paper talisman emitted a sanguine glow. A blood-colored Dao talisman lit up like a lamp.

The yellow paper talisman flew to the sanguine barrier and stuck to it like a seal. The sanguine barrier that was about to shatter stabilized and wasn’t shattered by the brilliance.

Zhou Wen was still reeling in astonishment at the might of the yellow paper talisman when the antelope suddenly rushed over. With a flick of its horn, it sent Zhou Wen and Ya’er flying. It leaped into the air and let Zhou Wen and Ya’er land on its back.

In the next instant, it galloped forward without any regard for its life. Its speed was so fast that even Zhou Wen felt the scenery on both sides rapidly sweep backward, turning extremely blurry.

Boom!

An apocalyptic beam descended and struck the sanguine barrier. Even with the power of the yellow paper talisman, the sanguine barrier shattered as a terrifying beam of brilliance fell.
