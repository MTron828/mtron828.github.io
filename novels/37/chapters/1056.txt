Chapter 1057: Invisible Dimensional Creature

Translator: CKtalon

“Were ancient humans capable of coming to the Moon to offer sacrifices?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the corpse.

“I don’t know. If you had asked me this question before now, the answer would definitely have been no. But from the looks of it now, even without rockets and other equipment, humans might have had the ability to reach the Moon.” Shen Yuchi shook his head slightly.

Under Shen Yuchi’s command, everyone left the cave and continued searching for useful clues nearby.

Among the people from the bureau, there were professional investigators. They were much more professional than Zhou Wen, so he didn’t focus on the investigations.

He slowly walked on the moon as he switched his Life Soul to Glimmer.

He could clearly sense that the Glimmer Life Soul was growing, but this growth wasn’t enough for it to break through to a Perfect Body.

Could it be that I have to use Glimmer’s interstellar teleportation ability to advance to a Perfect Body? Zhou Wen now roughly understood how Glimmer could advance. He felt relieved.

The Glimmer Life Soul already had the power to advance. It was only because he had never used Glimmer’s ability that he was unable to break through the final barrier.

Now, Zhou Wen only needed to use interstellar teleportation once to advance to perfection.

If I were to use Glimmer to teleport back to Earth, I should be able to advance to a Perfect Body.

Zhou Wen could sense that there was no mistake.

Zhou Wen planned on teleporting back to Earth after the matters on the Moon were over, allowing Glimmer to advance to a Perfect Body.

Shen Yuchi and company kept investigating and had already discovered many clues. According to the current clues, the previous astronauts had been attacked by an unknown creature when they dug out the tree stump.

Furthermore, according to the measurements of the mine, they discovered that there should be a natural pit hole under the tree stump. The creature that had attacked the astronauts was likely hiding in that natural pit hole.

“Director-General, there’s something very strange,” Wang Qiuyuan said as he surveyed the area.

“Speak.” Shen Yuchi and company looked at Wang Qiuyuan.

“There aren’t any astronaut corpses at the scene, nor are there any signs of a fight. This means that the dimensional creature is very powerful. It can directly devour them or forcefully detain them. However, look at these footprints. These footprints belong to that Mythical Companion Beast. These belong to those astronauts.” Wang Qiuyuan pointed at the footprints. “If we were to encounter a powerful dimensional creature, even if we were quickly devoured after discovering it, we would subconsciously retreat. Even if we didn’t take a step forward, the center of gravity for the step will shift. This should be obvious from the changes in the footprints.

“But from the looks of it, there’s no sign of that at all. It’s as though they didn’t see any terrifying creature, and were devoured without realizing what was happening.”

Everyone looked carefully at the footprints on the ground and realized that this was indeed the case.

“What do you think of this situation?” Shen Yuchi asked Wang Qiuyuan.

“I’m certain that they didn’t see the dimensional creature. It’s possible that the dimensional creature has invisibility, or it might have hidden somewhere and launched an attack when they weren’t prepared.” Wang Qiuyuan scanned his surroundings. “If that thing has invisibility, we have to be careful. Perhaps it’s watching us from somewhere nearby.”

Everyone was alarmed as Zhou Wen’s reaction was the greatest.

This was because he knew that the dimensional creature might not be invisible, but because its life form was so advanced—this resulted in them being unable to see it.

In other words, that dimensional creature might be a Terror-grade existence.

Is there really a Terror-grade monster hiding on the Moon? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he and Truth Listener scanned their surroundings at the same time, but they didn’t discover anything. However, this only made him even more alarmed.

“Zhou Wen, what’s your take?” Shen Yuchi pondered for a moment before his gaze landed on Zhou Wen.

“I think it’s best we leave this place quickly.” Zhou Wen was originally interested in the petals and tree stump, but now that they were gone and that there might still be a Terror-grade creature here, it wasn’t suitable for him to continue taking risks in such an environment.

“Let’s head back now.” Shen Yuchi had just given the order when he suddenly heard a tragic cry.

The screams coming from the communicator were short, as if someone had grabbed the person by his throat just as he had started shouting.

Everyone was alarmed as they looked around, but they didn’t discover anything. They didn’t find any dimensional creatures or blood. No one even discovered anyone injured.

However, one of them was missing. A perfectly fine person had vanished beside them.

“Lu Dong... Lu Dong...” Everyone felt their souls leap out of their bodies. As Shen Yuchi summoned his Companion Beast to stand guard, he shouted for the vanished inspector.

No response. The communicator was terrifyingly quiet, as though the inspector had been erased from the world.

Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to release Ice Maiden. At that moment, he was almost certain that the dimensional creature on the moon was likely a Terror-grade existence.

Shen Yuchi and company, who were feeling nervous, were shocked when they suddenly saw a woman beside Zhou Wen.

However, when they saw Zhou Wen’s behavior, they imagined that the woman was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast, but her aura didn’t seem right.

At times like this, no one was in the mood to investigate if the woman was a Companion Beast or something else. Shen Yuchi immediately gave the order to evacuate.

“It’s best you don’t go over.” Zhou Wen stood there without moving because Ice Maiden’s eyes were looking in the direction of their retreat. Furthermore, she looked rather solemn.

“What did you discover?” Wei Ge stopped and asked Zhou Wen.

“That thing should be over there,” Zhou Wen said as he looked in the direction that Ice Maiden was looking.

Shen Yuchi and company hurriedly retreated. Shen Yuchi looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Can you see it?”

“I can’t see it, but she can.” Zhou Wen looked at Ice Maiden and asked, “How is it? What is it? Are you confident?”

“It’s very tricky. Even if I can win, I’m afraid I won’t be able to protect you,” Ice Maiden said.

So it’s really at the Terror grade? Zhou Wen no longer had any doubt. To make Ice Maiden say such words, it had to be at the Terror grade.

“Director-General Shen, it looks like we can only escape separately.” Zhou Wen wanted to summon the Earth Elemental Beast and planned on using its Earth Escape ability to escape.

“Whoever moves first will become its target,” Ice Maiden said again.

Upon hearing Ice Maiden’s words, Zhou Wen had no choice but to give up summoning the Earth Elemental Beast and stood there motionless.

Even though Zhou Wen didn’t move, someone didn’t believe him. An inspector summoned an Epic Companion Beast that could fly. He wanted to use its power to escape in another direction.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
