Chapter 1152: Divorce Is Very Common Nowadays

Translator: CKtalon

In the An family in Luoyang, a guard reported to An Tianzuo in the study. “Overseer, Miss Ya’er has been cooped up in her room the entire day. She is not responding to Nanny Yu at all. Madam isn’t home, so Nanny Yu is afraid something will happen. Overseer, she would like to consult you on what to do?”

“Why isn’t she eating again? Didn’t I tell you that she likes desserts?” An Tianzuo said as he got up.

“Nanny Yu said that she bought all the best desserts in Luoyang and even hired the best dessert chefs. However, Miss Ya’er won’t eat anything. She didn’t eat anything last night either, much less come out today,” the guard said.

“She hasn’t eaten anything since last night. How can she...” As An Tianzuo spoke, he walked out of the study and quickly walked towards Ya’er’s yard.

“Ya’er, why didn’t you eat today? Is the food at home not to your liking? Shall I take you out to eat?” An Tianzuo knocked on the door and said gently.

“I’m not hungry. I don’t want to eat.” The door creaked open and a girl about seven or eight years old walked out. She was as beautiful as a doll, but her expression was cold. It didn’t look like an expression a girl her age should have.

“You have to eat a little even if you don’t want to. You are still growing, so you have to eat more. If you are sick of Luoyang’s desserts, I’ll invite the famous dessert masters from the south over. They will make desserts that will be more delicious...” An Tianzuo said with a smile.

Ya’er shook her head. “Uncle, I’m really not hungry. I don’t want to eat.”

“How can you not be hungry? Wait in the living room. Uncle will personally cook something delicious for you. My signature dish. I guarantee you that you will like it,” An Tianzuo said as he headed for the kitchen.

Ya’er sat on the sofa in the living room and held her chin in boredom.

Although the An family’s life was very comfortable and everyone treated her well, she still liked the life of adventuring with Zhou Wen.

Suddenly, a figure flashed and two figures appeared in the living room. They were Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi.

Zhou Wen really couldn’t shake off Tsukuyomi, but seeing that she wasn’t a dimensional creature that killed at will, after much hesitation, he took her back to Luoyang.

As he didn’t know why the An family had created a fake Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen didn’t directly walk through the main door. He decided to teleport to the spot where he had eaten with Ouyang Lan to see if he could bump into her.

After completing the teleport, he didn’t see Ouyang Lan. Instead, he saw Ya’er sitting on the sofa in a daze.

Although Ya’er was much older than before, he could still make out her former appearance. Furthermore, she had a unique aura that others couldn’t sense. Zhou Wen had spent a lot of time with Ya’er, so he was very familiar with her unique aura.

When Ya’er saw Zhou Wen, she was first taken aback before she jumped up from the sofa in pleasant surprise and threw herself into Zhou Wen’s arms.

“You said you would take care of me!” Ya’er said angrily before opening her mouth and biting Zhou Wen’s neck.

Zhou Wen felt a pain in his neck, but he didn’t dodge. However, Ya’er didn’t really want to injure him. All she did was leave behind teeth mark without tearing his skin.

“It wasn’t what I wanted either, but I was locked up by someone else. I couldn’t come back to find you even if I wanted,” Zhou Wen explained.

“Who was it?” Ya’er bit her lip and asked.

“We’ll talk about that later.” Zhou Wen stroked Ya’er’s head. “You’ve grown taller and grown up. You’ve become even more beautiful and adorable.”

Ya’er narrowed her eyes like a kitten and leaned her hair on Zhou Wen’s hand. She rubbed it gently as though she enjoyed his touch.

“Ya’er, Uncle has made you...” An Tianzuo walked in with a bowl of piping hot glutinous rice balls. He was wearing a white shirt and military pants. He also wore an apron and was covered in flour. There was even a pinch of flour at the tip of his nose. He looked completely different from his usual dignified appearance.

However, when he saw Zhou Wen hugging Ya’er, the gentleness on his face immediately vanished as though he had instantly returned to the cold and arrogant Overseer An.

However, he was wearing an apron and holding a bowl. His face was covered in flour, and his bearing was rather inferior to his usual self. He didn’t look as arrogant as he usually was. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Seeing Zhou Wen turn his head, An Tianzuo immediately pulled off his apron and threw it at the guard beside him. He placed the bowl of glutinous rice balls on the table beside him and wiped his face. His expression instantly turned arrogant and cold.

“When did you return?” An Tianzuo asked Zhou Wen coldly.

“Just,” Zhou Wen answered.

An Tianzuo said coldly, “Since you’re back, stay at home for the next few days and don’t cause trouble.”

With that said, An Tianzuo glanced at Ya’er, who was in Zhou Wen’s arms with a smile on her face. He turned around and left. When he reached the door, he paused for a moment and said, “Ya’er hasn’t eaten much in the past two days. I’ve prepared a bowl of glutinous rice balls for her in the kitchen. Give it to her. To throw a child at home and be away for so long without returning. Aren’t you afraid the child will go bad?”

With that said, An Tianzuo walked out of the living room without looking back.

After leaving the living room, An Tianzuo instructed the guards beside him, “Give An Sheng a message. Tell him that the person is back.”

“Does the order need to be transmitted?” the guard asked.

“There’s no need. He knows what to do.” An Tianzuo took a few steps and seemed to recall something. He said to the guard beside him, “Go to the kitchen and get a cup of freshly squeezed orange juice for Ya’er. Heat it to 43 degrees.”

“Yes, Overseer.” The guard accepted the order and left.

Zhou Wen sat on the sofa and watched Ya’er eat the glutinous rice balls. Having not seen her for five years, Ya’er’s language skills had improved significantly. Although she still didn’t like to speak, her occasional words weren’t as simple and stiff as before.

Zhou Wen could also tell that Ya’er’s personality had become more cheerful. Clearly, the An family had taken good care of her in the past five years.

Ya’er had a good appetite perhaps due to Zhou Wen’s return. She quickly finished the bowl of glutinous rice balls and licked her lips as though she hadn’t had enough. She felt that the glutinous rice balls today were especially delicious.

With Zhou Wen by her side, Ya’er didn’t wish to speak. As long as she was by Zhou Wen’s side, she felt at ease and didn’t need to say much.

However, Ya’er’s gaze at Tsukuyomi seemed to carry some hostility.

“She’s Tsukuyomi, my friend. This is Ya’er, who’s no different from my sister.” Zhou Wen hurriedly introduced the two of them to prevent any trouble.

“I’m not an ordinary friend. I’m Zhou Wen’s wife,” Tsukuyomi deliberately emphasized her identity as she said with a smile.

“Divorce is very common nowadays,” Ya’er said expressionlessly.
