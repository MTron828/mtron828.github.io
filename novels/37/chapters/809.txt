Chapter 810: I’ll Wait for You Here

Translator: CKtalon

Should I give it a try and see if the passcode can open the huge metal slab beside the silver-haired Companion Beast? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but think.

If it were in the past, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have had the chance to approach the metal slab, but things were different now. With the Invisibility Cloak, he should be able to avoid the various surveillance cameras in the shop and reach the metal slab without anyone noticing.

Zhou Wen could have openly headed there and even bought the silver-haired Companion Beast, but he had a nagging feeling that there was something wrong with Qin Xiyuan. He wasn’t willing to let Qin Xiyuan know that he was interested in the metal slab.

In the end, Ouyang Lan failed to take away Ya’er and returned indignantly.

Zhou Wen thought about it for a while before finally deciding to head to Xiyuan Shop to take a look. Now that Ouyang Lan’s investigations had reached a bottleneck, it was unlikely for her to make any further progress. Perhaps the metal slab that chained the silver-haired Companion Beast could give Zhou Wen new ideas.

He packed up and fed all the Companion Beasts that needed to be fed. When he fed Demonic Neonate a few Longevity Fruits, she suddenly began evolving again.

She should be able to advance to the Epic stage this time, right? Zhou Wen was delighted. Demonic Neonate was one step closer to the Mythical stage.

However, looking at the remaining number of Longevity Fruits, he felt that these Longevity Fruits were probably insufficient to support Demonic Neonate’s evolution.

Thankfully, there’s still Grim Demon as backup rations. If there’s really no other way, it can be used to make do. Zhou Wen put away Demonic Neonate.

Before she completely evolved, there was no need to pin any hope on her strength in combat.

Banana Fairy was still evolving. She had been evolving for quite some time. Based on the time taken, she should be about to advance to the Mythical stage.

After packing his things, Zhou Wen set off for Qin Xiyuan’s shop.

Zhou Wen didn’t directly enter the shop. Instead, he went to a cafe near Xiyuan Store and ordered a cup of coffee. He sat by the window and planned on using Truth Listener to scan Qin Xiyuan’s shop while drinking coffee.

This cafe was relatively close to Xiyuan Store. Sitting here, Truth Listener’s range covered the entire store. He had to figure out the situation inside first.

“Sir, here’s your coffee.” The waiter served the coffee and politely placed it in front of Zhou Wen.

“Thank you.” Zhou Wen’s attention was focused on Xiyuan Store and he hadn’t noticed the waiter. When he heard a familiar voice, he looked up and couldn’t help but be taken aback. The person who had brought the coffee was Gu Dian.

Zhou Wen subconsciously looked around. Indeed, it was as he had imagined. The cafe was empty; there weren’t any customers.

Does the boss of this shop have a grudge with money? He actually hired Gu Dian as a waiter? Zhou Wen felt that the boss must be crazy.

“Gu Dian, why are you here?” Zhou Wen asked Gu Dian in puzzlement.

“Working to earn some money,” Gu Dian answered.

“Can working here be more profitable than fighting dimensional creatures and selling the dropped Companion Eggs?” Zhou Wen was still somewhat puzzled.

Gu Dian was considered one of the strongest figures in Sunset College. If he were to sell Companion Eggs he obtained, his income was definitely not something ordinary people could compare with. Furthermore, he was only a waiter at a cafe, so his salary couldn’t be much.

“Yes.” There weren’t many customers in the cafe, so Gu Dian didn’t leave.

“No way? This cafe can give you such a high salary?” Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that a waiter could earn so much.

Furthermore, this cafe didn’t have any business at all. It was impossible for it to pay a high salary.

“150,000 a month,” Gu Dian answered.

Pfft! Zhou Wen spat out the mouthful of coffee he had just drunk. He widened his eyes and looked at Gu Dian. “The boss here gives you 150,000 a month?”

Zhou Wen felt that the boss must be nuts. Otherwise, there was no way he would give Gu Dian such a high salary.

Gu Dian nodded and saw a customer enter. He said, “I need to get back to work.”

Zhou Wen watched Gu Dian head over and say politely, “Welcome.”

When the young couple saw Gu Dian, they seemed to be frightened as they immediately took two steps back. Without even entering, they turned around and quickly walked away.

I knew it. With Gu Dian around, how can business be good? Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out why the boss of this shop would hire Gu Dian.

After drinking a mouthful of coffee, he felt that it tasted pretty good. It was actually hand-made coffee.

Unable to figure out the reason, Zhou Wen had no choice but to stop thinking and begin scanning Xiyuan Store.

Truth Listener’s ability enveloped the vicinity of Xiyuan’s shop. It was as though it had turned transparent. Zhou Wen could hear every corner of the building clearly.

To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the floor where the silver-haired Companion Beast was located was enveloped by a mysterious force, as though it was enveloped by a thick fog.

Zhou Wen raised Truth Listener’s strength to its limits as the fourth level within the fog slowly became clearer.

The various Companion Beasts imprisoned inside could be seen clearly. Zhou Wen focused his attention on the room where the silver-haired Companion Beast was. Indeed, he saw the silver-haired Companion Beast sitting beside the large metal slab with its head lowered as though it was asleep.

When Zhou Wen’s attention landed on him, the silver-haired Companion Beast looked up and clearly glanced in Zhou Wen’s direction. It was as though it was looking into his eyes, shocking him.

Can he see me? Or is it a coincidence? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.

Suddenly, beneath the silver hair that covered most of the Companion Beast’s face was a grin. Then, its lips moved as though it was saying something.

However, he didn’t make a sound. However, from the shape of his mouth, he seemed to be saying, “I’ll wait for you here.”

He can indeed see me. Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed.

After Truth Listener advanced to the Mythical stage, its abilities were already very powerful. Furthermore, observing someone through hearing and vision was different. One’s gaze was active, so it wasn’t surprising for those with sharp senses to notice it when someone looked at them.

Truth Listener’s hearing was passive. It was only gathering information. Yet, the silver-haired Companion Beast was actually able to discover his location. This ability was a little too powerful.

What’re the origins of that silver-haired Companion Beast? Zhou Wen was puzzled as he wondered about entering.

Now, Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. If the chains that bound the silver-haired Companion Beast were unlocked after entering the passcode, could he be doing something foolish?

What does he mean by waiting for me? Could it be that he knew I would come? Zhou Wen was alarmed and puzzled. The entire matter was odd.

From the moment the former principal sent him the passcode, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. As the matter developed, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn’t as simple as he had imagined.

At the very least, the silver-haired Companion Beast in front of him was definitely a terrifying existence. If the former principal had placed the silver-haired Companion Beast in the store, how could he have caught such a Companion Beast? The former principal probably didn’t have such strength.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
