Chapter 1576: Sunset City

Translator: CKtalon

As one of the six families, the Cape family had been like the other five families in recent years. Compared to the era when the six families controlled the Federation, they appeared abnormally low-key.

Of course, such a low profile didn’t mean that the Cape family had really reached a point of no return. Instead, the six families were working hard to digest the resources brought about by the evolution of the world.

In the past, the six families relied on the Holy Land, but as Earth’s dimensionalization sped up, this served as an opportunity for them to obtain a large number of resources without relying on the Holy Land for resources like before.

This was also the main reason why the six families dared to attempt to escape the Holy Land’s control. Only with resources could they have the capital to resist.

In this rapidly changing era, the Cape family was the family that had changed the most.

The Cape family actively attempted anything—Companion Beasts, Guardians, Spirit Casting, Mythical Serums—that could make humans stronger. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This allowed the Cape family’s strength to constantly increase. The development of the dimensional zones surrounding them was also the highest among the various families.

Sunset City was the city that the Cape family had built in a dimensional zone in recent years.

It was dark in the dimensional zone due to the lack of natural light. Only the city was brightly lit, so it was also called City of Nightlights.

This dimensional zone was called the “Forbidden Zone of the Gods.” It was a dimensional zone that the Cape family had discovered and developed in recent years. The Forbidden Zone of the Gods was very strange. It was like a world that couldn’t be illuminated by divine light. There was no birth, aging, sickness, or death here, as though being here gave one eternal life.

Of course, this was referring to the natural way of life. People still died from being murdered.

After the Cape family discovered the characteristics of the Forbidden Land of the Gods, they established Sunset City here. The members of the Cape family gradually moved to live in Sunset City.

The faces of the humans living here seemed to be frozen. They looked the same as they did a few years ago. There were no signs of aging.

Only by leaving Sunset City would time continue to leave signs on them.

Who didn’t want to live forever? The Cape family used the magical powers of the Forbidden Land of the Gods to recruit many young geniuses. Their faction also grew stronger day by day.

It was only because they hadn’t completely developed the dimensional zones they controlled and didn’t have the energy to plunder resources from other places that it gave off the impression that the Cape family had become much more low-key in the past few years.

Zhou Wen had long heard of the Cape family’s Sunset City and the Forbidden Land of the Gods. He had always wanted to visit, but he had been tied down by other matters and didn’t have the spare time.

The reason Zhou Wen wanted to come to Sunset City wasn’t because he wanted to cause trouble for the Cape family due to his grudge with them. He was eyeing the dimensional zone known as the Forbidden Land of the Gods.

Zhou Wen had recently been studying which dimensional zones were compatible with his Essence Energy Art. He wanted to advance his Essence Energy Art to the Calamity grade as soon as possible.

Back when he saw some information about the Forbidden Land of the Gods, Zhou Wen felt that this place might be very compatible with his Dao Sutra or Godfiend Era.

There might be doubt since the Dao Sutra was an Essence Energy Art from the East District, so how could it be compatible with the Forbidden Land of the Gods?

Zhou Wen didn’t believe that it was a problem. He only looked at the characteristics and didn’t deliberately distinguish between the East and West District.

The Dao Sutra Zhou Wen cultivated took the Zero Taboo path. As for the Forbidden Land of the Gods, it also had the ability to ban nomological powers. Therefore, Zhou Wen felt that the two were somewhat similar and wanted to try his luck.

Furthermore, a special space like the Forbidden Land of the Gods seemed to have some compatibility with the spatial-type Godfiend Era.

Of course, these were all Zhou Wen’s guesses. He had never been to the Forbidden Land of the Gods and only felt that there was such a possibility. This was the perfect opportunity for him to visit.

Furthermore, he didn’t have a good relationship with the Cape family. If he really fought Jiuyang and destroyed their territory, Zhou Wen wouldn’t feel the pinch.

If the Forbidden Land of the Gods was really compatible with his Essence Energy Art and could help him advance to the Calamity grade, it would inevitably destroy the Forbidden Land of the Gods. Zhou Wen wouldn’t be troubled by that or feel sorry for the Cape family.

“Stop. Entry to the area ahead is forbidden. Unauthorized people are not to enter.” A Guardian of the Cape family blocked Zhou Wen and Jiuyang’s path.

“Please inform the owner here that we wish to enter,” Zhou Wen said to the Guardian with a smile.

“Do you have an appointment?” the Guardian asked as he sized up Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was wearing casual clothes and had a child-Demonic Neonate-in his arms. He looked completely different from when he entered the rankings. The Guardian clearly didn’t recognize him.

“What are you talking about? Don’t you see the Saint here. What appointment do we need?” Zhou Wen pointed at Jiuyang.

“So what if it’s a Saint? This is the Cape family. Without an appointment, even the Holy Father can’t enter, much less a Saint.” The Guardian was very unyielding.

Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t angry. He said to Jiuyang with a smile, “Your reputation doesn’t seem very useful!”

Jiuyang didn’t even look at Zhou Wen as though he wanted to ignore him.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to push the matter of entering Sunset City to the Saint, but he couldn’t help but feel depressed when he saw Jiuyang remain silent.

A young man walked out and said to Zhou Wen, “Mr. Zhou, if you wish to enter Sunset City, you just need to give your name. There’s no need to do it in the name of the Saint.”

“You know me, but I don’t know you. Isn’t that a little unfair?” Zhou Wen sized up the young man.

The man was in his twenties and he didn’t look much older than Zhou Wen. He had blonde hair and blue eyes. He had a high nose bridge and a slender figure. Although he was nearly two meters tall, he didn’t look excessively tall due to his good proportions.

“My name is Carlos. Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhou.” The young man smiled and extended his palm.

“I don’t expect your Cape family to be happy seeing me.” Zhou Wen didn’t extend his hand as he looked at him.

“I don’t know if the Cape family will be happy seeing you, but I’m very happy to see you. You have always been my idol,” said Carlos with a serious expression.

“Are you sure I’m an idol? Not someone you want to beat up?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.

“Mr. Zhou, you’re reading too much into it. The grudge between you and the Cape family is one thing, but my admiration for you is another. Although I also want you dead, this doesn’t affect my admiration for your achievements. If possible, I hope you can help me sign an autograph. I’ll definitely treasure it,” said Carlos sincerely.

“There’s no need for an autograph. Let’s shake hands.” Zhou Wen extended his hand and shook Carlos’s hand.

Zhou Wen definitely didn’t dare randomly sign autographs.
