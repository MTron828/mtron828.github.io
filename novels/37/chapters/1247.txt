Chapter 1248: The Only Name on the Rankings

The light shone on Tsukuyomi’s body, but nothing abnormal happened. The fiery-red light didn’t seem to have any lethality.

Just as all sorts of questions arose in everyone’s minds, they saw something fly out of the metal palace amidst the crimson red light and slowly land in front of Tsukuyomi.

It was a metal ball. What was surprising was that the metal ball looked very similar to Venus.

The moment Tsukuyomi obtained it, the screen of Cube began to change. People couldn’t see the scene in the dimensional zone, nor could they see the scene outside Venus.

The scene that appeared on the Cube wasn’t unfamiliar to everyone. It was the Cube ranking that they had often seen in the past.

From the rankings of one to one hundred, there was only one name.

“Tsukuyomi!” People couldn’t help but recite the name. Only then did they realize that it wasn’t the Chang’e they thought. Few people in the Federation knew this name, but many people overseas knew it.

After all, she was a top deity in a particular pantheon. As long as one knew of this pantheon, there was a high chance that they had heard of her name.

Behind Tsukuyomi, five shiny golden stars appeared.

No one knew what the golden stars meant, nor did anyone know what the situation was.

However, most people had already guessed that the Cube ranking still existed. However, only creatures who had cleared the Venusian dimensional zone had the right to appear on the rankings.

Such a requirement frightened many people.

What was even more infuriating was that they didn’t see the situation after Tsukuyomi entered. This was because after Zhou Wen entered the Venusian dimensional zone, the Cube’s ‘camera’ followed him, so they saw as much as Zhou Wen did.

After Tsukuyomi obtained the metal ball, Zhou Wen suddenly felt a strange force. Then, he found himself at the entrance of the Venusian dimensional zone.

Tsukuyomi also appeared there, still holding the metal ball in her hand.

“Follow me.” Before Zhou Wen could say a word, Tsukuyomi walked over and grabbed his hand, teleporting him away.

However, Tsukuyomi didn’t teleport back to Earth. Instead, she arrived on an asteroid. Zhou Wen’s knowledge of astronomy was ordinary, so he didn’t know which asteroid it was.

However, after using the Singularity Universe to compare, Zhou Wen already knew where he was. They were still in the Solar System and hadn’t left.

“Thank you for saving me,” Tsukuyomi said with a smile—her eyes curving into crescents—as she released her hand.

“Even without me, you could still have caught that bullet, right?” When the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords blocked the bullet, Zhou Wen saw Tsukuyomi’s other hand move.

If his guess was right, Tsukuyomi had actually discovered the bullet that had circled back. Even if Zhou Wen hadn’t saved her, she could have caught it with her strength.

“Without you, I’m afraid it wouldn’t have been that easy to reach the Golden Palace. You’ve been a great help,” Tsukuyomi said with a smile.

Zhou Wen thought nothing of it, but from Tsukuyomi’s tone, she didn’t seem to be able to kill the dimensional creature.

“Can you tell me what’s going on?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.

“Naturally not others, but if you want to know, sure.” Tsukuyomi recounted the matter regarding the Venusian dimensional zone.

Just as Zhou Wen had imagined, Tsukuyomi hadn’t killed the dimensional creature. In fact, there was no need to kill it. As long as one could reach the Golden Palace like Tsukuyomi, they would be considered as clearing the Veniusian dimensional zone. The dimensional creature wouldn’t hunt them down any further.

As for the metal ball, it was indeed a reward for passing the Venusian dimensional zone.

“Is that metal ball a Companion Egg?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the metal ball in Tsukuyomi’s hand.

Tsukuyomi threw the metal ball to Zhou Wen. “Take a look.”

Zhou Wen caught the metal ball and realized that the tiny metal ball was shockingly heavy. Furthermore, it had a scorching heat. It was unlikely anyone below the Mythical stage could lift it. Even if one forcefully picked it up, they would be scalded by the high temperature.

Although the metal ball looked very strange, Zhou Wen didn’t sense any vital signs from it. He only saw five golden star-shaped symbols on the metal ball.

“It doesn’t look like a Companion Egg. What is it?” Zhou Wen returned the metal ball to Tsukuyomi.

“It can be said to be a Companion Egg, but also not one,” Tsukuyomi said as she played with the metal ball.

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled, unsure what Tsukuyomi meant.

Tsukuyomi explained, “This metal ball is a product of the Venusian dimensional zone, but it’s not the only one. All creatures who can reach the Golden Palace can obtain a similar ball.”

After a pause, Tsukuyomi looked at Zhou Wen with a faint smile and said, “If you can reach the Golden Palace, you will also be able to obtain such a ball. When the time comes, many creatures will obtain the same metal ball. After everything ends, most of the metal balls will become useless. Only a few of them will become Companion Eggs, but there’s only one true Companion Egg.”

“There’s only one true Companion Egg. Could it be…” Zhou Wen realized something as his expression changed slightly.

Tsukuyomi saw through Zhou Wen’s thoughts. “From the looks of it, you’ve probably figured it out. That’s right. The Venusian dimensional zone’s appearance isn’t for killing, but to find a home for the Companion Beast inside Venus. Only the strongest creature has the right to obtain its recognition and become its host.”

“What will happen to Venus when that Companion Beast has an owner?” Zhou Wen asked with a heavy expression.

“What do you think will happen if a Companion Beast breaks out of its shell?” Tsukuyomi said.

“Will Venus will be destroyed?” Zhou Wen knew that he had guessed correctly.

Tsukuyomi nodded. “Perhaps this is a path that every planet has to experience. The billions of planets in the universe are actually huge Companion Eggs, but brute force is insufficient to obtain them. Every planet has its own unique way of survival. When the Companion Beasts inside them are about to hatch, they will find an owner for themselves.”

“Is it the same for Earth?” Although Zhou Wen already knew the answer, he couldn’t help but ask.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“In theory, all the planets in the Universe are the same. However, Earth seems to be somewhat special because there are too many dimensional zones there. Up to now, no one knows which dimensional zone is the one to obtain Earth’s Companion Beast,” Tsukuyomi said after some thought.

Zhou Wen finally had a clear idea in mind. If Earth was like Venus—a huge Companion Egg—then the dimensional zones on Earth might be the same as the Venusian dimensional zone. They were produced to select the ownership of Earth’s Companion Beast.

However, for some reason, there were too many dimensional zones on Earth. There were so many that it was unknown which dimensional zone was the true test for Earth’s Companion Beast.

The dimension kept searching, but they clearly failed to find it.

“What’s the level of the true Venusian Companion Beast? A Calamity-grade?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought. He was very curious about this matter.
