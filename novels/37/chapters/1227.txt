Chapter 1228: The One and Only Looter King

Zhou Wen didn’t dare stay for long as he teleported back to Earth. Zhou Wen’s luck was pretty good—his teleportation took him to a city. He removed the Companion Beasts over him, returning to his original appearance.

It looked like a city in the West District. Zhou Wen didn’t carefully identify where he was. He took out his phone and watched the live broadcast of the Venusian dimensional zone.

The alarms on the six doors were ringing. The black dragon was heavily injured. Although it looked at the doors warily, it didn’t even know which door the other party would come out from.

Bam!

Before the gunshot was heard, the black dragon’s head exploded from a bullet. Dragon blood and brain matter splattered as the dragon body collapsed. Then, the Cube’s scene switched. Without a doubt, the Terror-grade black dragon had died inside.

Humanity didn’t even manage to get a gander at the person who killed the black dragon. Zhou Wen then found some high-speed slow-motion cameras on the Internet and could barely see that the bullet had shot out from one of the doors. He couldn’t even see what it looked like—it was only a blurry shadow.

The various factions analyzed the information obtained from this battle. They had pretty much analyzed the first four of the six Golden Battle Gods’ abilities. As for the last two, due to Zhou Wen’s interference, the information wasn’t complete, but they could roughly think of a reliable solution.

However, everyone shook their heads when they saw the final shot. For the time being, no one had the confidence to block it.

Most people were discussing Zhou Wen, who had taken advantage of the situation. They were very curious as to what kind of person had the ability and guts to snatch food from the tiger’s mouth under such circumstances and retreat in time.

As they didn’t know his origins, many media outlets gave Zhou Wen a nickname when writing reports about him.

There were all sorts of nicknames such as “Looter King”, “Adventurer King”, “Shameless Thief”, “Person Best At Taking Advantage”, and “Space Transporter.”

In the end, most people used the term “Looter King.” Furthermore, many media outlets determined that Looter King might be human, but there were also many people who didn’t think of him as human.

Many factions on Earth had the same idea. They could naturally tell that Zhou Wen was using spatial teleportation to enter the Venusian dimensional zone. The factions with such talents were eager to have a share of the loot.

After Liu Yun finished watching the entire process, he was very tempted. However, after careful consideration, he didn’t dare head to Venus. Like Zhou Wen, he waited for the other creatures to enter before taking advantage of the opportunity.

Liu Yun’s patience didn’t mean that everyone was patient.

Overseas, there was a contractor with a spatial Guardian who chose to enter the Venusian dimensional zone through the Cube.

Not all spatial powers had interstellar teleportation abilities, much less a Mythical Guardian.

When he reached the entrance to the Venusian dimensional zone, the Cube began its live broadcast again.

When people saw him use spatial teleportation to enter the dimensional zone and fight the Metal Guards inside, they immediately realized that he was a Mythical Guardian who was here to take advantage of the situation.

His goal was probably to kill a few Metal Guards before teleporting out.

Due to footage from the previous battles, the Guardian knew the Metal Guard very well. He had already thought of a way to restrain it and easily killed the Metal Guard. Furthermore, he was very lucky to have a Companion Egg drop.

The Guardian gleefully picked up the Companion Egg and wanted to teleport away before the six doors opened. His idea of taking advantage of the situation was to simply kill one Metal Guard.

However, to his surprise, after attempting to teleport, the Guardian’s expression changed drastically. He couldn’t leave the dimensional zone and was still trapped in the room.

In the next second, the six doors opened. Groups of Metal Guards rushed out with guns in hand. The bullets intertwined into an inescapable net.

The Guardian teleported a few times and summoned a Companion Beast to block them, but in the end, he was riddled with bullets that killed him along with his Companion Beasts.

Instantly, all the humans watching the live broadcast were stunned. They didn’t know what was happening.

Liu Yun was secretly glad that he had held back from teleporting in.

“Heavens, what happened just now? Why didn’t the Guardian teleport away?”

“Do you think anyone can be the Looter King? Looter King is at the Terror grade—an existence who can work with the black dragon to kill the Golden Battle Gods. Isn’t it courting death for a Mythical creature to want to loot?”

“Looter King is really powerful. He managed to escape after looting, but this fellow couldn’t even return alive.”

“For the same spatial teleportation ability, the effects of the Terror-grade and Mythical-grade should be about the same. Why can Looter King escape, but not the Guardian?”

“There must be some other restriction. Looter King is somehow able to break the restrictions.”

“There can only be one Looter King after all. There’s a risk when looting. One has to be careful.”

Everyone discussed spiritedly. This also alarmed the factions who wanted to use their spatial powers to take advantage of the situation like Zhou Wen. They didn’t dare act rashly.

Zhou Wen was grinding dungeons in-game and didn’t know about the Guardian. Otherwise, he would have taken advantage of it.

However, after watching the recording, Zhou Wen knew what the problem was. It wasn’t that the Mythical spatial transmission ability couldn’t be used, but that people who used the Cube to reach Venus were incapable of leaving the dimensional zone. They could only fight to the end. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The spatial ability he used wasn’t special. However, he couldn’t teleport through the Cube or use his blood to open the Venusian instance dungeon.

After this incident, no one dared to take advantage of the loopholes in the rules.

Zhou Wen farmed the Venusian instance dungeon again in-game, but he still failed to dodge the bullet. The shot was just too terrifying. Even the Limitless Demon Dragon King’s helmet exploded. His powerful damage immunity couldn’t withstand the bullet’s headshot. Clearly, the difference in strength was too great.

10% or even 5% of the destructive power wasn’t something Zhou Wen’s body could withstand.

From the looks of it, there’s no doubt that it’s a Calamity-grade creature. Do humans nowadays really have the ability to defeat a Calamity-grade to clear the Venusian instance dungeon? Zhou Wen wasn’t optimistic at all.

After more than a day, another creature entered the Venusian instance dungeon.

Zhou Wen had seen this creature before. It was the skeleton that resembled the Grim Reaper. It wore a cloak and held a scythe in its hands. It had opened the dungeon using the normal method.

Zhou Wen watched it kill the Metal Guard and realized that its strength was likely only at the Terror grade. However, the previous battle had already proven that the survival rate of a Terror-grade creature in the dungeon was pathetically low.

Zhou Wen really couldn’t figure out why the skeleton would choose to enter the Venusian dimensional zone under such circumstances.

Wait. What if entering Venus’s dimensional zone wasn’t of their free will but a result of coercion? An idea flashed in Zhou Wen’s mind.

Combining Tsukuyomi’s forced departure from Earth and the continuous attempts of these creatures into the Venusian instance dungeon, Zhou Wen thought of a possibility. Perhaps these creatures had their reasons for entering the Venusian dimensional zone. They hadn’t entered willingly.

If that’s the case, will Tsukuyomi ultimately enter? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but worry when he thought of Tsukuyomi.

Although Tsukuyomi was a Calamity-grade creature and might have the possibility of defeating the Venusian Calamity-grade creature, who could guarantee her victory?
