Chapter 1386: Natural Enemy

It was almost impossible to guess the weakness of a stranger.

Every human or creature’s weakness was different. Unless God personally came, it was impossible to know what anyone’s weakness was.

Furthermore, if Sweetie was really God, as God, even she couldn’t identify the weakness of one’s human nature, much less a mortal.

Although it was indeed effective to guess a person’s weakness in human nature based on their actions and reactions, it was impossible to have enough opportunities to observe and understand the opponent in a real battle.

Not every powerful enemy was like Shangguan Jinhong, a powerful adversary that ended up losing to his weaker opponent, Li Xunhuan[1].

Zhou Wen had previously wanted to interpret one’s weakness in human nature through observation. This path couldn’t be said to be wrong, but it was a very long path.

He now understood something. Perhaps he didn’t need much observation to obtain the desired outcome. All he needed to do was go from a microscopic view to a macroscopic view.

For example, rats were afraid of cats. Some plants liked water, while others were afraid of water. Some metals were easily oxidized, while others were difficult to oxidize.

Zhou Wen didn’t need to understand what a person or creature was afraid of. All he needed to do was grasp what restrained them thanks to nature, making it much easier.

This should be called a natural enemy, right??As his insights deepened, Zhou Wen realized that Slaughterer’s reaction was even more intense. It was unknown if it was because the enemy outside had produced fear that affected Slaughterer or if it was the result of his own epiphany.

Slaughterer constantly released Essence Energy. Zhou Wen felt his body being transformed by a strange force as his flesh and blood gradually changed.

Although it was still a body of flesh and blood, the modified parts seemed to have been given a new characteristic.

Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what kind of characteristic it was. His body was still the same, and his appearance hadn’t changed, but there was another qualitative change. It was magical and strange.

Slaughterer had fused with Zhou Wen’s body. Zhou Wen could clearly sense that his transformation was happening at the same time as him. The feeling was indescribable. If he had to describe it, it was like a twin that was telepathically connected.

In the past, Zhou Wen’s connection with Slaughterer wasn’t tight. In the beginning, he couldn’t even control Slaughterer because his personality was very different from Slaughterer’s. It could be said that they were antithesis to one another and incompatible.

Only today did Zhou Wen realize that he was truly one with Slaughterer—you are me and I am you. There was no distinction between them.

Zhou Wen only reached the level that ordinary humans could reach today.

The reason it was so difficult for Zhou Wen to advance to the Terror grade was not only because the Lost Immortal Sutra was difficult to advance, but also because of the conflict between Slaughterer and his personality.

However, at that moment, the two finally found a balance, or rather, a hub that connected them together. Slaughterer finally completely opened itself to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen didn’t like killing, but Slaughterer was born from killing. Zhou Wen shouldn’t have condensed such a Life Soul, but did so because of the influence of the Lost Immortal Sutra and the Lost Immortal Sutra’s owner.

The two constantly fused and adapted to each other until this opportunity appeared. Finally, there was no gap between them.

Perfect Sword Immortal was extremely surprised. For a mere human to withstand five Heavenly Tribulations without collapsing was unimaginable.

Although Perfect Sword Immortal had exaggerated the claim that the Nine Tribulations could destroy Apocalypse-grade powerhouses, very few Calamity-grade creatures could withstand the Heavenly Tribulation Sword.

I have to eliminate this fellow. Otherwise, it will definitely be a calamity for our race.?A cold glint flashed in the eyes of Perfect Sword Immortal as killing intent subconsciously appeared.

Previously, Perfect Sword Immortal had some qualms and didn’t wish to damage Jiang Yan’s body too much. However, now that he realized how terrifying Zhou Wen was, he immediately made a decision.

I can still find another representative, but I definitely can’t have this Zhou Wen stay alive.?Sword aura rose from Perfect Sword Immortal’s body as sword beams surged from his hair and skin. His clothes and long hair fluttered. The Skyimmortal armor that had advanced to the Calamity grade constantly emitted sword beams as terrifying sword intent surged out.

“Your Excellency… Don’t continue… Immortal’s body can’t hold on much longer…” Cave Era kept paying attention to Jiang Yan. She was Jiang Yan’s sister and knew how dangerous it was to be possessed by dimensional creatures.

Now, she realized that Immortal’s body had already shown signs of producing Essence Energy Crystals. This meant that Jiang Yan’s body couldn’t hold on any longer. If this continued, his body would completely crystallize. Even if he killed Zhou Wen, Jiang Yan would die.

However, Perfect Sword Immortal ignored her. Now, Perfect Sword Immortal only wanted Zhou Wen, a thorn in his side, dead. Everything else was secondary.

Seeing the sword intent and sword beam over Perfect Sword Immortal rapidly strengthen, Cave Era’s heart turned cold.

Uesugi Nao and Blood Shaman wore mixed expressions. Anyone could tell that Perfect Sword Immortal was sacrificing Immortal. If Immortal could be sacrificed, what about them?

Cave Era instantly made a decision. Temporal power rapidly condensed over her body as time seemed to freeze.

“Cave Era, what are you trying to do?” Uesugi Nao and Blood Shaman looked at Cave Era in surprise.

“Immortal can’t die. You can stop me, but today’s Immortal might be you tomorrow,” said Cave Era.

Blood Shaman exchanged looks with Uesugi Nao. Blood Shaman said, “Even if we don’t stop you, will your Guardian help you?”

Blood Shaman spoke gloomily. Guardians were created by the dimension after all. Would they become enemies with dimensional powerhouses for humanity?

After all, a Guardian contract was an equal contract. Guardians could terminate the contract unilaterally at any time.

Cave Era extended her palm and looked at her Guardian armor as she muttered to herself, “Are you… still willing to follow me… This trip might result in death… If you aren’t willing, leave…”

“Why… fight… when… you… know… you’ll… die…” A voice that sounded ancient sounded from Cave Era.

“Because living like this will be more painful than death,” Cave Era answered.

After a second of silence, it wasn’t just Cave Era. Uesugi Nao and Blood Shaman also held their breaths nervously as they stared at the Guardian armor on Cave Era. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The voice that seemed to come from the ashes of history sounded again. “Instead of eternal life in infinite time, why don’t you turn eternal for a limited time? Since you want to fight, as you wish… Time… is infinite…”

The sound seemed to break through the sealed door of history. The entire armor began to emit temporal powers, instantly pushing them to their limits. Everything around them seemed to freeze as they went into super slow motion.
