Chapter 323 Sacrificial Items

“Ah Sheng, no matter how I think about it, the problem lies with the statue. Get someone to examine it in detail again, but be careful. I have a nagging feeling that the stone statue’s appearance in a place like that is a little too bizarre. It might take the life of people.” Zhou Wen couldn’t explain his discovery in-game, so he could only tactfully tell An Sheng.

“Okay, I’ll send someone to check the stone statue again.” An Sheng answered seriously.

After hanging up, Zhou Wen entered the game again and continued attempting to attack the stone statue in-game. This time, Zhou Wen learned his lesson and distanced himself from the stone statue before sending a gust of Great Yin Wind over.

The Grand Yin Wind hit the stone statue, causing it to actually open its mouth and swallow the Grand Yin Wind. The terrifying Grand Yin Wind entered what seemed like a bottomless pit. And that was it. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Even the Grand Yin Wind is useless? Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He knew that to deal with the suspected Aoyin statue, he couldn’t use force. He needed to think of a way.

en use

I remember the ghost stories Grandpa told me when I was young. In ancient times, humans believed in ghosts and gods. Often, they held rituals to offer sacrifice to the ghosts and gods. Some ignorant and evil people would even use living people as a sacrifice. With that Aoyin statue placed there, could it be that it needs to be offered sacrificial items? Although Zhou Wen found the idea a little ridiculous, he didn’t have any other solutions and could only give it a try.

Zhou Wen didn’t have the ability to use living humans as a sacrifice. Even if he was capable of doing it, he wouldn’t. Therefore, after some thought, he decided to capture two poison bats and take them to the Aoyin statue and offer them as a sacrifice to the Aoyin.

However, there was no reaction from the stone statue when Zhou Wen delivered the two poison bats to the stone statue’s mouth.

Do I really need to use living people? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and smashed the head of the poison bats before delivering it to the stone statue again.

This time, the stone statue had a reaction. It opened its mouth and sucked, swallowing the two poison bats that had their heads opened

up.

After swallowing the poison bats, Zhou Wen felt that the two forks were somewhat different. However, he couldn’t put a finger on the differences as he hurriedly ran towards the left tunnel.

After stepping into the tunnel, he realized that it was still a square stone passageway. It didn’t turn oval, nor did the sharp crystals appear. He couldn’t help but feel delighted as he rushed deep into the tunnel.

The tunnel wasn’t long, spanning about a hundred meters. Soon, Zhou Wen reached the end and found that there was a stone door. Pushing it open, he found a palace inside.

Before he could carefully observe the palace, a terrifying dimensional creature lunged forward. Zhou Wen was only able to see its shadow before the blood-colored avatar was smacked to death.

The monster resembled a tiger or wolf with two tails. It was a monster that emitted black flames all over its body. With his Ghost Steps’ speed, he wasn’t able to dodge the monster’s attack. Even if it wasn’t at the Mythical stage, it was probably close to one.

Zhou Wen didn’t give up. He went to the stone statue again and sacrificed the two poison bats before using the right fork. Indeed, the right tunnel had become safe as well. There weren’t any strange text monsters.

At the end of the right tunnel was another palace. The moment Zhou Wen opened the door, he saw a strange snake standing erect like a dragon as it spewed out black smoke at the blood-colored avatar.

Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned his remaining Purple Air Bell and sucked all the black smoke in. Then, he shook the bell, sending the black smoke back at the strange snake.

Like a tide of black smoke, it instantly drowned the monster snake’s massive body. The snake opened its mouth and inhaled, and the black smoke was sucked back in. His actions failed to damage it.

Then, Zhou Wen saw the black gas rise from the strange snake as though an ancient demon god was enveloping it.

Zhou Wen cursed under his breath as he turned around to escape. The snake’s eyes turned into a mirror that reflected the blood-colored avatar’s figure.

Not long after the blood-colored avatar ran out, it collapsed to the ground and died. The game screen went black again. Zhou Wen didn’t even know how it had died.

Don’t tell me the creatures in the two palaces are at the Mythical stage? Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed. Just as he was about to probe further, he heard his phone ring.

Zhou Wen immediately picked up the call when he saw that it was An Sheng.

“Young Master Wen, as you expected, the stone statue is problematic,” An Sheng said directly.

“What did you discover?” Zhou Wen asked.

“During the inspection, the stone statue was completely normal and we didn’t discover any problems with it. Later, an expert attempted to put a mechanical arm into its mouth to investigate, but it was swallowed. After that, there was a brief change in the two tunnels. Our men were able to enter the tunnel without disappearing. However, it wasn’t for long. In less than an hour, the passageway returned to normal,” An Sheng said calmly.

However, Zhou Wen could tell that plenty of sacrifices had been made.

“From the looks of it, the stone statue needs sacrifices. Why don’t we try using dimensional creatures as sacrifices? If it’s really Aoyin, it might be interested in the brains of dimensional creatures,” Zhou Wen said.

“I’ll get someone to try it now.” An Sheng paused before saying, “At the end of the two tunnels, there are doors to a palace. But I didn’t get them to open the palace. Young Master Wen, any thoughts on this?”

“Since the Aoyin guarding the tunnels is already so terrifying, a powerful dimensional creature will definitely guard the palace’s interior. It might even be a Mythical creature. I think it’s best to be careful. Don’t open the door hastily.” Zhou Wen could only provide warnings. He couldn’t possibly say that he had entered the palace in-game and that there was a terrifying existence suspected to be a Mythical creature inside, right?

“I share the same thoughts too. If there really are Mythical creatures inside, it’s not something we can deal with. We can only seek the Overseer’s help.” An Sheng thought for a moment before saying, “Young Master Wen, it’s all thanks to you that we can make progress so quickly. Unfortunately, you’re still too young. In a few years, if you can advance to the Epic stage, I might have a chance to fight alongside you.”

“I have no intention of joining the military. After I graduate, I plan on opening a crystal shop for a living,” Zhou Wen said.

“You aren’t that kind of person.” An Sheng didn’t wait for Zhou Wen to say anything before saying, “I’ll hang up now and report our progress to the Overseer.”

“Ah Sheng, if you aren’t confident, make sure not to enter the palace at the end of the tunnels. I have a feeling that there will be terrifying dimensional creatures inside,” Zhou Wen exhorted again.

“Don’t worry,” Ah Sheng said before hanging up. It was unknown if he would listen to Zhou Wen.
