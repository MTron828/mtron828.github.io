Chapter 1575: Jiuyang Comes Knocking

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen imagined that the Chaos Egg would be capable of withstanding the treasure beam when it landed on the Chaos Egg.

Zhou Wen was somewhat dumbfounded the next second. The treasure beam didn’t attack the Chaos Egg. Instead, it carried the Chaos Egg towards the jade book and stored it inside.

Zhou Wen struggled to get out to no avail. He was forcefully pulled into the book. Just as he was thinking about how to escape, he heard a thud as the book snapped to a close.

Zhou Wen felt his surroundings turn dead silent as though it was an endless dark void. He couldn’t see, hear, or sense anything.

He attempted to rush out, but there was nothing around him. No matter where he went, the outcome was the same. It was as though there was no end to the void.

This is definitely Starlord Merciful Song’s domain power. I wonder what domain this is. Why is it so odd??Zhou Wen knew that things were going south.

Although Starlord Merciful Song didn’t kill him, trapping him here forever was worse than killing him.

Thankfully, this was a game, so Zhou Wen could commit suicide again. In reality, it was basically no different from dying.

Of course, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait for Starlord Merciful Song to open the jade book. He knew the principle of striking first to gain the upper hand.

He had made it a habit in-game to identify the other party’s abilities before taking action. It was mainly to understand the abilities of dimensional creatures. Otherwise, even if he killed a dimensional creature, he wouldn’t even know what abilities it had.

He failed to come up with a way to escape after some extended thinking. Even if he released the Golden Wyrm Scissors, it could only fly randomly in the endless void. There was no way out.

Here, spatial powers didn’t seem to work as though they were locked. Zhou Wen was actually unable to use spatial teleportation or instant transmission. He had no choice but to commit suicide.

Dripping a drop of blood to revive, he was just about to enter the dungeon and gain the upper hand over Starlord Merciful Song by killing him with the Golden Wyrm Scissors and not giving him a chance to flip open the jade book when he suddenly heard his phone ring.

“Old Zhou, someone’s looking for you.” It was Li Xuan.

“Who?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

“He’s wearing a cloak and a mask. It’s impossible to tell who he is. However, from his bearing, he shouldn’t be an ordinary person. Do you want to meet him? If not, I’ll defeat him and send him on his way,” Li Xuan said.

“Let me take a look first,” Zhou Wen said as he walked out and quickly arrived at the door.

“Where is he?” Zhou Wen saw Li Xuan drinking tea in the guardhouse.

“Over there.” Li Xuan curled his lips towards the left of the door.

Zhou Wen looked in that direction and saw a person standing under the shade of a tree. Indeed, just as Li Xuan had said, the person was tightly covered up. One couldn’t even tell if the person was male or female.

However, Zhou Wen recognized him at a glance and couldn’t help but be slightly taken aback.

Jiuyang, what’s this fellow doing here??Zhou Wen found it odd.

Zhou Wen was wondering why Jiuyang was being so polite if he knew that he was Egg Sovereign and wanted to seek revenge.

However, if he wasn’t here to seek revenge, what else could Jiuyang be doing?

“Do you know him?” Li Xuan asked as he drank his tea.

“Jiuyang,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Pfft!” Li Xuan spat out the tea he had just drunk. “Which Jiuyang? Saint Jiuyang?”

“Who else could it be? I’ll go see what he’s here for,” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards Jiuyang.

“Who are you? Why do you want to see me?” Zhou Wen came in front of Jiuyang and asked, feigning ignorance.

“You know who I am,” Jiuyang said calmly. “I came here to invite you to the Holy Land as a guest.”

“Although I don’t know who you are, I appreciate your kindness. It’s best if you return. A sanctified place like the Holy Land isn’t a place an ordinary person like me can go.” Zhou Wen rejected it without even thinking.

Holy God hated him to the core. It would be odd if something beneficial awaited him in the Holy Land.

“Alright, if you defeat me, you don’t have to go,” Jiuyang said bluntly.

In fact, Jiuyang’s main goal for coming here was to fight Zhou Wen. Whether Zhou Wen went to the Holy Land was a matter of Holy God’s concern. Jiuyang didn’t care, but he couldn’t disobey Holy God’s orders.

“Don’t joke around. How can I beat you?” Zhou Wen said.

“If you don’t know who I am, how do you know that you can’t beat me?” Jiuyang said calmly to Zhou Wen. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Zhou Wen knew that he had been careless, but he didn’t need to worry about such matters. He said with a smile, “Saints from the Holy Land are each stronger than the last. No matter which one of them comes, a mortal like me isn’t their match.”

“It’s useless no matter what you say. Fight me or I’ll take you back through force. The outcome will be the same,” Jiuyang said to Zhou Wen.

“Why don’t we do this? Go back for now. I’ll visit the Holy Land when I’m free. I really have something on now and can’t leave.” Although Zhou Wen was already at odds with the Holy Land, he wasn’t willing to fall out with it.

“Do you want to choose the venue or should I do the honors?” Jiuyang ignored what Zhou Wen said and continued speaking at his own pace.

When Zhou Wen saw Jiuyang’s behavior, he knew that things wouldn’t end well today. Instead of letting Jiuyang fight him here and cause Guide City to suffer, he might as well choose a venue himself. At the very least, he wouldn’t harm his family and friends.

“Follow me,” Zhou Wen said as he vanished.

Ordinary people couldn’t even see Calamity-grade entities when they traveled at the speed of light.

Jiuyang didn’t say a word as he followed. He followed beside Zhou Wen at an unhurried pace. Clearly, he was much faster than Zhou Wen.

Of course, this wasn’t Jiuyang’s speed, but the speed of the Sun God Guardian.

“You are indeed very strong, but you don’t have a Guardian. Did you use Spirit Casting or a Mythical Serum?” Jiuyang sized up Zhou Wen as his eyes gradually lit up.

“Would you believe me if I said that I didn’t use Spirit Casting or a Mythical Serum?” Zhou Wen said as he flew.

“No,” Jiuyang answered with certainty because he had never seen a human advance to the Mythical stage purely as a human, much less to the Calamity grade.

“Then I can’t answer you.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he had already crossed the mountain range known as the spine of the world and continued heading west.

“Why are you running so far? There’s no one here,” Jiuyang said.

“It’s boring without anyone. I’ll take you to an interesting place. It’s more interesting to fight there..” Zhou Wen continued flying forward without looking back as he headed for the West District.
