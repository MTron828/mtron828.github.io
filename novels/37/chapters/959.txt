Chapter 960: Deep Blue Crab Sovereign

Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to observe carefully and heard a massive object moving in the sea.

Before he could determine what the behemoth in the sea was, he suddenly saw the seawater suddenly rise, forming a huge wave. And within that wave, a huge, castle-sized, dark-blue crab crawled out from the sea.

The huge crabs that looked like tanks on the beach were already huge, but in front of the dark-blue crab, they looked like baby crabs.

Even the twenty-meter-tall wall appeared much shorter in front of the huge crab. Its pincers were terrifyingly large.

Everyone was stunned seeing the giant crab come out of the sea. Even the Epic experts who were fighting the crabs had a drastic change in expression.

Before the giant crab’s legs could walk out of the sea, it suddenly opened its mouth and spewed out countless bubbles. The bubbles flew towards Sea Return City and filled the sky.

Someone shot at the bubbles that flew over. When the bullet hit a bubble, the bubble that looked light and thin didn’t burst. Instead, after the bullet entered the bubble, it immediately floated in the bubble as though it had escaped gravity.

Some people used sabers or ordered their Companion Beasts to charge forward and destroy the bubble, but no matter what it was, it would be sucked into the bubble the moment it touched it.

Then, the bubbles that had sucked in something seemed to be pulled into the sky by some force. In the blink of an eye, they flew hundreds of meters high and continued rising rapidly, as though they were about to break through the atmosphere and enter outer space.

When people saw this scene, they began to dodge the bubbles in horror. After all, there were very few humans who knew how to fly. Some Epic humans couldn’t fly in the air because they didn’t have flying pets.

If they fell from such a height, they would probably die a terrible death.

Furthermore, the bubbles rose rapidly. If they really entered outer space, they would definitely die.

Instantly, the entire defense line of Sea Return City fell into chaos. Ignoring ordinary people, even Epic experts began retreating. As for the crab legion, the effective resistance against them collapsed, allowing them to rush to the high walls of Sea Return City. They used their steel-like crab pincers to strike the high walls, splattering concrete and cracking steel alike. Before long, the high walls would be breached.

The air bubbles that filled the sky had already floated into the city. Seeing that Sea Return City definitely couldn’t withstand such an attack, Zhou Wen put on the Jade Crystal Spirit armor and suddenly flew into the sky, quickly arriving above the sea.

He held a Golden Harp in his hand as he strummed it.

Hum!

A strange sound spread out all the bubbles in the radius of the Golden Harp burst. The crabs that had either reached the shore or were still in the water were struck by the terrifying sound wave. They spewed out water and fell to the ground. About 80% of them died. Those that survived were severely injured as they struggled to get up.

Zhou Wen deliberately used String Aural Quake above the sea at a spot relatively far from Sea Return City. Although String Aural Quake’s power still affected the city, it was already relatively weak. It didn’t possess much lethality against humans.

Humans who could fight on the front lines had some level of cultivation. After being shaken by the aftershocks, they would at most spit out blood.

After being shaken, the people from Sea Return City turned to look out. When they saw that the water bubbles that filled the sky had almost all burst and that countless crabs had died, they couldn’t help but be pleasantly surprised.

They looked up and immediately saw Zhou Wen in the distant sky.

Sea Return City was several kilometers from the coastline. It wasn’t that they had good eyesight, allowing them to see Zhou Wen from such a distance.

It was because Zhou Wen was wearing the mirror-like Jade Crystal Spirit armor. When the sun shone on him, he was like a humanoid light source. It was difficult not to see him.

The might of String Aural Quake isn’t bad. Unfortunately, it’s too useless. I can only use it once. Zhou Wen glanced at the Golden Harp in his hand. A few of the strings had snapped, so he couldn’t use it again. All he could do was unsummon it and let it slowly recover.

The giant crab was very close to Zhou Wen. It staggered and nearly collapsed into the seawater. It couldn’t help but fly into a rage as it brandished its huge crab pincers and smashed them at Zhou Wen.

Although it was huge, it wasn’t clumsy at all. The crab pincer swung in front of Zhou Wen like a gust of wind.

At that moment, many people in the city were looking at the airborne Zhou Wen. They were given a fright when they saw the giant crab move like a ghost.

Zhou Wen didn’t flinch as he unsheathed his Bamboo Blade. At the same time, his body rapidly flashed in Transcendent Flying Immortal form as he struck out with Sky Slash.

The people in the city only saw the humanoid figure rapidly flicker around the giant crab like streams of light crisscrossing. When Zhou Wen stopped again, the giant crab stopped with its pincers raised in the air.

Crack! Crack!

The giant crab’s shell suddenly cracked open. The crab pincers it held up broke into several pieces and fell into the water, stirring up waves.

Boom!

In the end, even the giant crab’s body crumbled into a few pieces and fell into the sea. It couldn’t be more dead.

When the humans in the city saw this scene, they were momentarily taken aback. They stared blankly at the gigantic crab’s sorry state and at Zhou Wen, who was like a human-shaped sun in the sky.

Moments later, everyone finally reacted and cheered. The joy of escaping death was incomparable. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Zhou Wen rushed into the sea and vanished from everyone’s sight.

By the time he returned to Sea Return City, the Jade Crystal Spirit armor on his body had vanished. He looked like a young father carrying Ya’er. He wasn’t conspicuous at all.

However, there was an additional crab tattoo on Zhou Wen’s body. It was obtained from hatching the giant crab Companion Egg he had fished out from the sea.

Deep Blue Crab Sovereign: Mythical

Life Providence: Ocean Overlord

Life Soul: Heart of the Ocean

Wheel of Destiny: Loss of Gravity

Strength: 80

Speed: 71

Constitution: 80

Essence Energy: 79

Talent Skill: Gravity Bubble, Overlord Pincer, Deep Sea Emperor

Companion Form: Mount

Is it an ocean mount? Not bad. Zhou Wen didn’t have an underwater mount yet. The Great Might Vajra Bull was afraid of water. It was fine for it to walk in a stream, but it was impossible for it to enter the sea.

The Earth Elemental Beast was of little use in water. He happened to lack an underwater mount.

However, the Deep Blue Crab Sovereign was too big. He probably couldn’t use it for tiny streams and rivers, so he could only use it in the ocean.

From the looks of it, my luck has been pretty good recently. I obtained such a good Mythical Companion Beast shortly after coming to Sea Return. Perhaps this is a lucky place for me, Zhou Wen thought.
