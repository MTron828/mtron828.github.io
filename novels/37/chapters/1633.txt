Chapter 1634 Each With Their Own Scheme

If it were an ordinary person, they probably wouldn’t be able to use Companion Beasts in Toad Immortal’s Money Domain.

However, Zhou Wen could still maintain a portion of his abilities and the use of his Companion Beasts. He still maintained the connection between the Demon Dragon King armor and the eight Companion Beasts. This was all thanks to the Teacher Domain.

Although the Teacher Domain wasn’t as powerful as the Money Domain, it wasn’t completely suppressed; it even had a certain effect on Toad Immortal.

Despite both being at the Heaven level, the Void Salamander was only good at the power of void lightning, but Toad Immortal’s power was more varied and difficult to deal with.

As for Jiuyang, Xiao, and company, they were actually about the same as Zhou Wen. They were all at a pseudo Heaven level. They were still a distance away from the true Heaven level.

Toad Immortal’s tongue swept over like lightning. Zhou Wen used the Transcendent Flying Immortal he had figured out and moved gracefully. He dodged Toad Immortal’s tongue attacks again and again, and even seized some opportunities to counterattack.

However, Toad Immortal was far from what Jiuyang and company could compare with. Not only was he powerful, but his combat techniques had also reached the sublime realm. With him holding the advantage, even Transcendent Flying Immortal couldn’t suppress him.

The concept of the Zenith Heaven True Immortal! Toad Immortal recognized the concept of Transcendent Flying Immortal at a glance as though he was very surprised. His strange eyes sized up Zhou Wen in surprise as he thought to himself, What’s wrong with this human? Not only is he proficient in taboo powers, but he’s also at the Zenith Heaven True Immortal realm, one of the highest realms of us Immortals… Is this fellow really human? Could it be some big shot of the Immortal race who descended and he’s deliberately plotting to make things difficult for me?

However, after watching for a while, Toad Immortal dispelled this thought. Zhou Wen’s Zenith Heaven True Immortal concept was only at the beginner level. If a true Immortal big shot were to descend using possession, it shouldn’t be at this level.

A human can actually reach such a level. To be able to comprehend the concept of the Zenith Heaven True Immortal at such a level, it would be too unreal if not for Immortal big shots pulling the strings from behind. The more Toad Immortal thought about it, the more he felt that something was amiss. He suspected that there was some big shot behind Zhou Wen who was scheming against him.

Back at the Queen Mother of the West, he had fallen for a scheme. As the saying went, once bitten, twice shy. The more Toad Immortal thought about it, the more he felt that something was amiss.

With this in mind, Toad Immortal hesitated. He didn’t dare attack Zhou Wen with all his might. He held back a little and secretly observed, hoping to find any clues.

Toad Immortal’s reputation wasn’t good. The legend of a toad lusting after a swan’s flesh had tarnished his reputation. However, in terms of strength, Toad Immortal’s strength wasn’t as terrible as the rumors said. Otherwise, he would have died at the Queen Mother of the West’s place.

How could it be as simple as being banished to the mortal realm after molesting the Swan Fairy at such a place? Furthermore, he had brought out the Moon Essence Basin, a treasure of the Moon.

Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. He could clearly sense that the pressure Toad Immortal exerted on him had weakened significantly.

Although Toad Immortal still had the advantage, Zhou Wen didn’t feel the pressure of being on the brink of death. He didn’t know what Toad Immortal was thinking or what motives he had, but it was a good thing for him.

Although the Teacher Domain was still far inferior to Toad Immortal’s Money Domain, it wasn’t just a taboo domain. The true strength of the Teacher Domain lay in the word “Teacher.”

At that moment, the Teacher Domain was constantly accumulating the trajectories of the Money Domain. It was as though it was completing a jigsaw puzzle as it gradually pieced together the corresponding trajectories of the Money Domain. After successfully completing all the trajectories the last time, he gained an additional “Great Void Lightning Art” on the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. Later on, he attempted to piece together the trajectories of Xiao and Old K’s powers, but he failed.

Back then, Zhou Wen had roughly guessed that for the Teacher Domain to condense an Essence Energy Art, the domain had to be at least a Heaven-level perfect domain. It might even be even more stringent. Toad Immortal’s strength was stronger than the Void Salamander’s, and it was even stranger. Zhou Wen felt that it was highly likely that he could turn the Money Domain into an Essence Energy Art.

Of course, Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t cultivate the Essence Energy Art. However, the process of condensing an Essence Energy Art was also needed to evolve the Teacher Domain. It would make the Teacher Domain stronger. After condensing the Void Lightning Grand Art, the Teacher Domain could seal the formerly unsealable Heaven-level void lightning domain. Then, after converting the Money Domain into an Essence Energy Art, it should be able to seal Toad Immortal’s Money Domain. When the time came, Zhou Wen’s chances of defeating Toad Immortal would be much higher.

Toad Immortal wasn’t in a rush to go all out, much less Zhou Wen. The two of them had their own ulterior motives. The battle looked intense, but in fact, it wasn’t that dangerous. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Jiuyang and Xiao rushed into the glacier rift. After passing through the glacier layer, they realized that there was still a stone abyss beneath them. It led deep into the core. The interior shimmered as their vision and various Essence Energy detection abilities were screened. It was unknown how deep it went.

Occasionally, a strange blue light would flash below. It was from the blue ribbon-like Calamity creature that was flying towards the abyss.

“Strange!” Xiao stared at the abyss and frowned.

“What did you discover?” Jiuyang asked.

“From the music that tempted dimensional creatures to commit suicide, the Companion Beast on this planet should be music-type. However, do you see any traces of music-type powers in the abyss?” Xiao pointed into the abyss. “It’s indeed a little strange. I don’t see any music-type powers. There’s only a power that’s close to death…” Jiuyang sensed for a moment before continuing, “However, my Sun God Light is the nemesis of that dark aura of death.”

Xiao nodded. “In that case, let’s go in and take a look first. Don’t let those Calamity creatures snatch the initiative. It will be troublesome if the Companion Beast is devoured by them.”

Jiuyang nodded slightly as the Sun God Light on his body bloomed before he charged into the abyss.

Xiao followed behind Jiuyang and used the power of the Sun God Light to ward off the psychedelic light.

After descending countless meters into the abyss, the psychedelic glow in front of them suddenly vanished. They found themselves inside a huge spherical space.

Is this the core of the planet? Jiuyang looked around and realized that there was a white egg-shaped object floating in the middle of the huge spherical space.

The egg-shaped object looked very strange. The white outer shell was like a membrane of some creature. It looked very thin and was almost transparent. One could even see a blurry light seeping out of it.

On the membrane-like outer shell, there were many black blood vessels. They varied in thickness and were distributed under the outer shell, but they protruded in a pronounced manner. They looked like blood vessels no matter how one looked at them.

Furthermore, the entire egg was like a heart as it shrank and expanded. As this continued, the blood vessels became thicker and thinner. There was even liquid flowing in them, making it look ugly and bizarre.
