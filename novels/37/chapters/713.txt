Chapter 714: Worm Dugu

Translator: CKtalon

The dimensional creature contorted as it attempted to burrow into Zhou Wen’s hand, but it was blocked by a force that prevented it.

The doctor brought over a specially tempered piece of glassware that he had prepared and Zhou Wen placed the dimensional creature inside.

It constantly twisted and slammed into the glass container, hoping to rush out. Unfortunately, it was too weak and couldn’t break through the tempered glass. Furthermore, there was an instrument made of Essence Gold above the glass container. It had a weakening effect on dimensional creatures.

The elder didn’t believe that Zhou Wen had really taken out the dimensional creature. He ran into the ward and wanted to examine Qin Wufu to confirm if the dimensional creature in his brain had really been taken out.

However, there was no need for a checkup. The elder knew that Zhou Wen wasn’t faking it. When he entered the ward, he saw that Qin Wufu had already woken up.

“Sorry for making everyone worry.” Although Qin Wufu was still weak, his brain seemed to be functioning normally. He could already speak.

“You are Young Master Wen, right? Can you tell me how you did it?” the elder asked Zhou Wen.

“No,” Zhou Wen answered bluntly.

The elder was slightly taken aback as he carefully sized up Zhou Wen before continuing, “With Young Master Wen’s abilities, it would be a pity if he doesn’t join my Dugu family. Our Dugu family needs talented people. Young Master Wen, why don’t you consider it?”

“Mr. Dugu, isn’t it inappropriate for you to poach one of ours in front of our Overseer?” An Sheng said.

“The Federation is a family. Young Master Wen, you really should consider our Dugu family. Otherwise, your ability will be wasted.” As the elder spoke, he cupped his hands at An Tianzuo and said, “I’ve broadened myself today. Thank you for the Overseer’s invitation. However, with Young Master Wen around, I’m afraid we won’t have many opportunities to cooperate in the future.”

“Mr. Dugu, you’re being too polite. There are still many opportunities for cooperation in the future,” said An Tianzuo.

Before the elder left, he gave Zhou Wen an additional glance.

Qin Wufu chatted with Zhou Wen for a while until the doctor told him to rest. Only then did Zhou Wen leave.

When Zhou Wen arrived at the entrance, he saw An Sheng waiting for him in the car, but he didn’t see An Tianzuo.

“Overseer has something to attend to. He told me to take you back,” An Sheng said with a smile.

“It’s not far. I can go back myself,” Zhou Wen said as he got into the car.

“It’s mainly because there’s something I need to tell you. The person you saw just now is called Worm Dugu. He’s a member of the Dugu family. In terms of seniority, Dugu Ge has to call him second uncle. The Dugu family is adept at microscopic Companion Beasts, and this person is an expert in Gu-type Companion Beasts.” An Sheng explained the origins of Worm Dugu in detail.

“Why are you telling me this so solemnly? Could it be that there’s something wrong with this Worm Dugu?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Young Master Wen, you are getting sharper. Although Governor Qin was injured because of the break-out creature at Chess Mountain, we still have our suspicions. Firstly, we haven’t seen such a dimensional creature in Chess Mountain before. Secondly, the Dugu family lives far away in the South District. It’s a coincidence that Worm Dugu happened to be in Luoyang. Although it might be a coincidence, it’s best to be careful,” An Sheng explained.

Zhou Wen understood what An Sheng meant. If the thing in Qin Wufu’s head was really put there by Worm Dugu, then with Zhou Wen ruining the plans, Worm Dugu probably wouldn’t give up easily.

“Young Master Wen, that white ball-like Companion Beast of yours is quite fun. Why don’t you let it out for some fresh air? Perhaps there will be an unexpected gain,” An Sheng said casually.

“I will.” Zhou Wen knew that An Sheng wanted him to use Tai Sui to prevent the invasion of Gu-type Companion Beasts.

Unfortunately, Tai Sui was still evolving. It was probably useless for the time being.

After returning to school, Zhou Wen summoned Primordial Spore and made it stand guard. Tai Sui was still evolving, so it was the only weapon that could deal with microscopic Companion Beasts.

...

Under the surveillance of An Sheng’s men, Worm Dugu checked into a hotel. After dinner, he returned to his room to rest. He didn’t do anything strange.

Through the surveillance cameras, one could even see that Worm Dugu was sleeping in bed. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

However, in a place they couldn’t see, a mosquito secretly flew out of the room, passing through the streets and heading for Sunset College at an unbelievable speed.

As Worm Dugu flew, he thought to himself, How can those fools from the An family defend against me? I want to see how capable Zhou Wen is to be able to extract the Blood Thread Brain-Eating Gu that was connected to his brain. Even if I were to take action, it would be impossible for me to pull it out as cleanly as him. With his ability, he’s practically a genius at raising Gu worms.

The mosquito-shaped Worm Dugu quickly arrived at Sunset College. After getting his bearings, he headed for Four Seasons Garden.

Others might not be able to find Zhou Wen’s location, but Worm Dugu had a smell-seeking Companion Beast. It could find Zhou Wen by searching for his remnant smells.

Soon, the mosquito-shaped Worm Dugu arrived outside Zhou Wen’s building. He sniffed and confirmed that this was Zhou Wen’s residence.

Worm Dugu landed in the grass on the yard and thought to himself, Let’s get my baby to test his strength first.

With a thought, he summoned a Companion Beast that looked like a spider. The spider was only the size of a fingernail and it was gray. One wouldn’t be able to see it if one didn’t pay attention.

The spider accepted the order from Worm Dugu and crawled towards Zhou Wen’s building. It crawled in through the crack in the door in a seemingly easy manner.

Just as Worm Dugu wanted to use the perspective of his spider Companion Beast to take a look at the situation inside the building so that he could pick up a strand of hair or a skin flake to proceed with the next step of the plan, the spider suddenly lost contact with him. Worm Dugu Worm didn’t even see a thing.

He’s indeed prepared. However, if he thinks that he can defend against me just because of some preparations, he is severely underestimating my Dugu family. Worm Dugu didn’t seem surprised. With a thought, he summoned some Companion Beasts.

This time, it wasn’t a spider, but an even smaller insect. It was like a black sesame seed, so small that it was almost indiscernible. There were many of them.

Under the control of Worm Dugu, the black sesame-like flying insects flew into the dormitory through the cracks in the door, windows, and so on.

Although my hundred or so Black Blood Gu are only at the Legendary stage, they can enter the bloodstream the moment they see it. As long as one is bitten by it, they will quickly reproduce in the blood. They can only be cured by me. I want to see if you have the ability to get these Black Blood Gu out as well, thought Dugu Gu.
