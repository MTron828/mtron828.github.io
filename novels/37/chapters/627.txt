Chapter 628 Life Reversing Spirit Talisman

Liu Yun hesitated for a moment. Finally, he made up his mind and took out something from his pocket.

It was a strange jade talisman that was just the size of a palm. It was jade-white in color, but there was a red symbol engraved on it. It looked strange, its meaning was unknown.

"It wasn’t easy for me to get this Life Reversing Spirit Talisman from the Zhang family. This is the only one I have. I originally planned to try my luck after meeting the owner of Primordial Sword Immortal, but I can’t be bothered with that now." As Liu Yun spoke, he held the jade talisman in his hand and used Star Stealer again.

Crack!

Before Liu Yun’s palm reached into the void, the jade talisman shattered. The blood-colored runes seeped into his palm and shimmered.

"The Zhang family’s Life Reversing Spirit Talisman can flip Yin and Yang and turn the universe on its head. Although it can’t really change fate, it can invert the probability of my Star Stealer. It will allow me to steal the Companion Beast with the lowest probability, the ones that are almost impossible to steal. Although it doesn’t mean that the chances of a Mythical Companion Beast are the lowest, typically speaking, one only has one Mythical Companion Beast. The chances are definitely not high. Therefore, the chances of stealing a Mythical Companion Beast are definitely very high for me now."

Liu Yun muttered to himself as he suddenly pulled out his hand. At the same time, he shouted, "Come, Tyrant Behemoth. I have a feeling that it’s definitely you this time."

Zhou Wen was given a fright when he heard Liu Yun’s words. He was really afraid that Tyrant Behemoth would really be stolen. He focused his attention and circulated Gods Retreat.

However, when Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast tattoo trembled, his expression turned odd.

The trembling tattoo was actually Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

Ever since he had obtained the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Zhou Wen had been very careful. He didn’t dare release him easily, afraid that he would be affected by the Jinxes Master skill.

Previously, Zhou Wen still needed the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to restrain Qiongqi. Now, with Tyrant Behemoth, there was no need for him. Zhou Wen had been in a dilemma on how to deal with it.

He never expected Liu Yun to steal the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen released the restrictions and got Liu Yun to steal the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

I can observe the effects of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s Jinxes Master skill on others. Will the Jinxes Master Skill only take effect when released? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

"Come on, my Tyrant Behemoth..." Liu Yun quickly pulled out his palm from the void.

Liu Yun was overjoyed when he saw that it wasn’t a Musical Note Sprite that came out of his palm.

However, upon careful inspection, it wasn’t Tyrant Behemoth. Instead, it was a heavy-armored warrior riding a tiger. He looked extremely ferocious and domineering, exuding an extraordinary aura.

A humanoid Companion Beast? Its aura is so domineering and ferocious. Could it be a Mythical Companion Beast? Liu Yun watched as the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General transformed into a stream of light that landed on him. At the same time, some information surged into his mind.

Unfortunately, Liu Yun didn’t have the mysterious phone. He couldn’t check the information regarding the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. All he could do was obtain some information from the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to gather some vague details.

"Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General... Epic..." Liu Yun learned the name and level of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. He could also sense the Life Providence and Life Soul a little, but it was limited to their names. He didn’t know much about it. All he could do was wait until he summoned it out to test its various abilities in combat.

"I never expected that punk to have such a good life." Liu Yun had no choice. After much difficulty, he had only managed to steal one Life Reversing Spirit Talisman from the Zhang family. Even the Zhang family didn’t have many. It would be impossible to steal one from them again.

Furthermore, it was too late. He only had two thefts left.

He had once again used Star Stealer, but it was still a Musical Note Sprite.

"This is the last time. God, Mother Mary, bless me. Let me steal a big one..." Liu Yun prayed before using Star Stealer again.

When a Companion Beast appeared in his palm, Liu Yun was delighted when he saw that it wasn’t a Musical Note Sprite. However, when he pulled it out, he realized that it was only an Epic Poison Bat. He couldn’t help but be greatly disappointed.

"It’s really a huge loss. I wasted a wish and even used the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman. I only managed to steal these crappy things..." Liu Yun was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood.

He clearly knew that Zhou Wen had many Mythical Companion Beasts, but he had only managed to steal trash. It was unacceptable.

There was nothing he could do even if he was indignant about it. He had expended a lot of energy this time, so it was impossible for him to use Star Stealer anytime soon.

"Forget it." Liu Yun got up and prepared to return. He had already made up his mind. He would pretend to lose his Companion Beast and then accuse Zhou Wen of being a villain. It would be fine as long as Zhou Wen thought that the dimensional creatures nearby were fooling around.

"How unlucky. How can I only steal those crappy things?" Liu Yun felt a little depressed. There was a small stone in front of him, so he kicked it.

However, the stone remained motionless despite the kick. Liu Yun felt as though he had kicked a metal plate. He cried out in pain as he hugged his foot.

"With my foot’s strength, even steel should be shattered. How can the stone remain motionless..." Liu Yun felt that something was amiss.

Before he could take a closer look at the stone, he saw the surrounding soil split open. The flowers and trees seemed to have been lifted up by something as they rose out of the soil.

Liu Yun felt the ground beneath his feet rise as he hurriedly retreated.

As he retreated, he saw a huge gray object burrow out of the ground. From its appearance, it looked like a huge Horned Beetle. Its body was the size of a truck. The small stone that Liu Yun had kicked was the tip of the Horned Beetle’s horn.

"What’s this?" Liu Yun had seen many dimensional creatures that resembled Horned Beetles, but this was the first time he had seen such a huge one.

Not only was this Horned Beetle huge, but its body was also like a gray stone. It looked odd and there were many ancient and mysterious patterns on its back. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The instant the Horned Beetle tore out of the ground, it charged at Liu Yun. Its speed was much faster than a real truck. It was like a fast-moving vehicle.

Mythical creature! Liu Yun nearly cried out in surprise. Without any hesitation, he exerted his strength to leap up and dodge the attack of the Horned Beetle.

However, when he exerted strength, he lost his footing. Not only did he fail to jump, but his legs sank in.

Boom!

The front end of the Horned Beetle had already slammed into Liu Yun. The powerful force blasted apart the surrounding soil and trees, forming a huge crater. It was like a meteorite hitting the ground.

Holy sh*t, could this be the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s Jinxes Master skill? I didn’t think it was that powerful when I had him with me. Zhou Wen wore a look of surprise when he saw this. He couldn’t be certain that it was because of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General because Liu Yun hadn’t summoned it.
