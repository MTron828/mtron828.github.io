2142 Four Season Duke

Four Season Duke went to the training ground as he usually did. And there, he prepared to start teaching Suppress Evil. But after waiting a while to begin, he noticed there were only a few people in attendance. This made him frown.

Although the training ground wasn’t usually packed, the seats in his lectures were usually around 90% filled.

After all, quite a few students had learned Suppress Evil in Sky Palace. And when they had trouble improving their proficiency with it, many would come to hear what Four Season Duke had to say. This was the first time the place had ever been so empty.

“Luan, why have only a few of you come? Where is Qu Hao?” Four Season Duke asked, as he looked over the handful of students.

Luan and Qu Hao focused on Suppress Evil more than any others. They always appeared in the lessons given by Four Season Duke.

“They’re... attending another teacher’s lesson...” Luan spoke with nervousness and guilty reluctance.

“I see. And which teacher are they studying under?” Four Season Duke focused on Suppress Evil. He didn’t care about anything else, so he didn’t pay much attention to the other instructors.

“They... have gone to listen to Han Sen,” Luan answered.

“Han Sen? What does he teach?” Four Season Duke asked with much curiosity. Even he had heard Han Sen’s name before.

“He... teaches...” Luan was struggling to spit out the words. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“What’s wrong with your mouth? Why do you keep stumbling? What does he teach?” Four Season Duke frowned.

“He is teaching Suppress Evil,” Luan finally stated.

“Suppress Evil?” Four Season Duke’s frown was a deep one. But after a moment, his expression relaxed again.

Han Sen hadn’t been in Sky Palace for very long. Even if he had started learning Suppress Evil the day he arrived, there was no way he could have achieved much with it.

If the students were listening to Han Sen, Four Season Duke concluded that it was just because of Han Sen’s celebrity status. He was the freshest kid on the block. After the students heard a lecture or two from Han Sen, they would quickly recognize which of the two teachers were better at Suppress Evil, and they’d be eager to return.

“All right, let’s start. Today, we are going to talk about the theory of Suppress Evil...” Four Season Duke started his lesson.

Four Season Duke thought that, after a couple of days, that freshness would wear off and his old students would start flocking back to him. But a few more days after that, the students hadn’t come back. Even more had chosen to abandon him, as a matter of fact. Aside from a few students that he had personally trained, all the others were gone.

Now Four Season Duke started to feel upset. There were only a few students in front of the stage now, and so he couldn’t help but frown and say, “I am not teaching today. Let’s go listen to Han Sen and see what is attracting everyone to his lectures.”

Four Season Duke left the stage and headed toward Han Sen’s lecture. Luan and the others followed.

Not long after, Four Season Duke arrived at Han Sen’s training ground. When he walked inside, Four Season Duke turned to ask Luan, “Luan, is he really talking about Suppress Evil?”

It was not surprising that Four Season Duke had to ask this. In the training grounds, everyone had their sleeves rolled up. They appeared to be practicing punches. To Four Season Duke, it looked like Han Sen was teaching a simple punching skill. He found it hard to believe what was being taught was actually Suppress Evil.

“Um... he is teaching Suppress Evil. Han Sen said that this is a Suppress Evil punch. You will learn the skill if you learn the punch,” Luan explained.

“What a load of nonsense. What does a firm punch have to do with Suppress Evil?” Four Season Duke frowned. He wasn’t a rash person, though, so he didn’t do anything. He planned to listen to Han Sen and figure out a smarter way in which he could fight back.

Four Season Duke had researched and studied Suppress Evil for a number of centuries. He was a very patient man, so he wouldn’t do anything impulsive or stupid. He found a place to sit down, and he waited there to listen to Han Sen.

The students that practiced Suppress Evil all knew who Four Season Duke was. Seeing him there, sitting and listening quietly, they all knew things were about to get interesting.

“Four Season Duke is here! Oh, Han Sen is in trouble now!”

“Will something happen?”

“Perhaps not. They might bicker, but that’s about it.”

“To be honest, Four Season Duke is a very high level person. But if I am going to learn, following Han Sen would be the easier route.”

“Yeah. Han Sen’s method of teaching is such a breath of fresh air. It is easy to learn and use.”

“You are right. After learning Suppress Evil punch from him, I can see things clearly that I used to have no hope of understanding.”

The students spoke quietly amongst themselves, but with the power Four Season Duke possessed, he could hear them as clear as a bell.

He frowned even harder than he had been, and he wondered to himself, “Can the practice of a punch really connect with Suppress Evil?”

A few minutes later, Han Sen arrived and started his lesson.

Han Sen was not aware that Four Season Duke was there. He had grown comfortable with the lessons and with the crowds that attended, so he didn’t keep an eye on each and every person who came to listen. He did allow them to ask questions once the lesson was over, however.

“Today, we talk about the Xiong Star Punch from the seventy-two Suppress Evil punches.” Han Sen started the lesson by talking rather than demonstrating. That wasn’t because it was a secret, though; it was just pointless to demonstrate this early.

The students had to work out the execution for themselves. Han Sen would show them only if they ran into trouble. That was how it worked. Showing people a fist skill, when they had never learned it before, was pointless. It would be like they were watching a show.

Four Season Duke wanted to argue with Han Sen as soon as he began lecturing, but after the Duke listened for a while, his jaw went slack.

Han Sen’s fist skill was simple, but it had the meaning of Suppress Evil within it. It all sounded as if it made perfect sense. Four Season Duke was not reckless. Before he figured out anything more, he decided to just listen.

Over the next few days, Four Season Duke attended each of Han Sen’s lessons. When the lecture ended, Four Season Duke left without saying anything. That was, until the last day of Han Sen’s lessons. All Han Sen did was walk on stage, and before he could do anything, Four Season Duke stood up.

All the students were surprised, knowing something was finally about to go down.
