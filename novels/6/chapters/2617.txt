Chapter 2618 Taking a Student for Teaching

In an office of Sky Palace, a collection of elders, officers, and other high-class people were discussing the events with great excitement.

“We’re talking about the Eleventh Leader’s sword skill, here. It is one of Sky Palace’s secret techniques. After being buried for all these years, it has finally been revealed. It should be a part of Sky Palace’s armory. We can’t allow an outsider to claim it. The one who got it was a foreign student, after all.”

“But you’re wrong. The Eleventh Elder left this request. How could we disobey his final wish?”

“This only happened because he was too old to understand that the white elephant might unwittingly select an outsider. A foreign student, no less!” The high-class people of Sky Palace had split into three different camps. One camp suggested putting the sword skill into Sky Palace’s list of secret skills, where only the truly important figures of the Sky could view

Another camp believed they should honor the final command of the Eleventh Leader and allow Han Yan to practice the sword skill she had been given. The final group wanted to take the Eleventh Leader’s sword skill to a place where they could research it. They wanted to modify it so all of Sky Palace’s students could practice it.

“Leader, please say something.” The Sixth Elder supported the group that wished to take the sword skill and put it on the restricted list. After the Sixth Elder spoke, everyone realized that Sky Palace Leader had yet to say anything in the discussion.

Sky Palace Leader said coldly, “There is no need to discuss this.”

“What do you mean, Leader?” Sky Chance Officer asked Sky Palace Leader with confusion.

Sky Palace Leader looked at him. Then, he turned his gaze back to everyone else who was present. “It doesn’t matter what decision we make if we can’t get our hands on the sword skill, does it?”

“Why could we not get it? We can ask Han Yan to present it to us. Would she dare not to? It belongs to Sky Palace, and if you want to take it back, then we would be totally within our rights,” Sky Chance Officer said flatly.

“You really think that would be an acceptable course of action? Yes, you are technically correct. But it sounds to me like you’re not giving any consideration to the Eleventh Leader and his request,” Yun Changkong said mockingly.

“I would never insult the Eleventh Leader... However, I don’t think the Eleventh Leader expected that he would end up handing over his skill to someone who wasn’t even a Sky. We are merely fulfilling our responsibility as leaders of our people. I am sure that his spirit in heaven would agree with our decision,” Sky Chance Officer said confidently.

Sky Palace Leader squinted, smiled, and said, “Sky Chance Officer is correct. We could argue that we were merely using our authority, but clearly, the Eleventh Leader knew we would want to take advantage of this situation. He sent his mount Hitting Sky Elephant to protect the skill and prevent young ones like us from stealing it under the guise of protecting our people. Do you have another plan to sort this out that involves the use of our authority?”

“If... if Han Yan is willing to hand it over, the Hitting Sky Big Elephant shouldn’t...” Sky Chance Officer said, before going quiet. He didn’t believe a single word that he was saying. The skill wasn’t recorded in text; rather, it had taken the form of a jade sword. The white elephant wouldn’t part with the jade sword for a minute. The white elephant didn’t care if Han Yan used the sword, but if anyone else came close to it, the Hitting Sky Elephant would attack them. The Sixth Elder was a prime example of what might happen if the white elephant got annoyed.

“The Hitting Sky Elephant is just a low-intelligence xenogeneic. I doubt it knows much. We can trap it and take the jade sword away. How could it stop us then?” an elder said with a hoarse voice.

“Seventh Elder, this is Sky Palace. We aren’t a den of thieves,” Yun Changkong said disparagingly.

“Yun Changkong, don’t let this become personal. Han Yan might be your student, but the sword skill is part of the legacy of Sky Palace. It isn’t your personal possession...” the Seventh Elder said with a cold grunt.

Yun Changkong was enraged by this, and he said, “What is that supposed to mean?” “You know what I mean. You shouldn’t have to ask.”

“Changkong, what the Seventh Elder said makes sense. That is how we will settle this matter,” Sky Palace Leader said to stop them both from fighting.

“Leader...” Yun Changkong said, looking sick.

“Leader, you are so smart.” The Seventh Elder grinned widely.

Sky Palace Leader ignored Yun Changkong’s icy stare. He smiled at the Seventh Elder and said, “Since you were the one to suggest this idea, Seventh Elder, please proceed with your plan to trap the Hitting Sky Elephant. Then, bring the jade sword to me.”

“Palace Leader, how am I supposed to do it alone? I need you to send some more deifieds with me. I’ll need them to trap the creature.” The Seventh Elder’s face changed. He could tell that the leader’s proposal didn’t sound right. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I can’t help you with that, I’m afraid,” Sky Palace Leader said calmly. “I’m hoping Han Sen can make a few more deifieds to balance out Han Yan’s acquisition of the skill, but I can’t lend you aid at the same time. You should think of a way. It’s your idea; don’t you think you can do it? You are eligible for a grand reward if you do.” “This...” Seventh Elder’s face was turning green. Yun Changkong felt relief flow through him. Sky Palace Leader was protecting Han Yan. Many of the elders and officers who had wanted to take the jade sword by force had suddenly stopped talking.

Sky Palace Leader wanted to protect Han Yan. And with Han Sen’s reputation as well, none of them were bold enough to try to get the jade sword by themselves.By doing so, they would be disobeying the leader’s orders and disrespecting Han Sen at the same time. Han Sen would likely never bless them if that occurred. Plus, Han Sen had two true god weapons, and he had drawn the attention of the Very High. He would only continue to gain power as time went by. If they stole things from Han Yan now, they’d be making an enemy of Han Sen.

“I will support whoever gets the sword skill back. If you can truly claim it, then I will reward you handsomely,” Sky Palace Leader said while looking at everybody. No one chose to speak.

Han Sen didn’t think the matter would be resolved so easily. The people of Sky Palace wouldn’t let such an important sword skill land in Han Yan’s hands.

But what he expected didn’t come to pass. Sky Palace didn’t come up with an excuse to take the Eleventh Leader’s sword skill for themselves. But Yun Changkong also didn’t take Han Yan as a student. Instead, he asked his teacher to be her teacher; in effect, he made Han Yan his little sister. That was another way of saying that she was on the same level as Sky Palace Leader.

After the teacher ceremony, Han Yan’s standing in Sky Palace became obscenely high despite her young age. Even Lone Bamboo, when he saw her, would have to refer to her respectfully.

Han Yan had picked holy gourds, received the legendary sword skill, and become a fellow student with Yun Changkong. She instantly became a legend all across Sky Palace. Her reputation exceeded even Lone Bamboo’s. Everyone knew Han Sen had an awesome sister.

Of course, what most students were fond of was her appearance.

Many students had discussed the subject of Han Sen potentially blessing her. Perhaps that was why she was so strong at such a young age. That made them want Han Sen’s blessing even more.
