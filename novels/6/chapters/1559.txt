Chapter 1560: An Incredible Son

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Han Sen observed Luo Haitang carefully with his Dongxuan Aura, and he indeed found something unusual.

Luo Haitang’s life force was indeed powerful, but it was too much. That kind of power was like a bonfire burning hard. The greater the fire was, the more quickly the body would be burned out.

Luo Haitang’s life force was still terrifically strong even under his suppression, though it was getting out of his control. Han Sen now believed much more of what the man had just said.

“I’ve also included the method for practicing Shura Change, but I’ve already changed it a little bit. It isn’t as powerful as the version I practice, but thankfully, it does almost no damage to your body.” Luo Haitang continued after pausing for a second. “If Han Yan can improve her power to the level of the Jade Shura over the next several years, then she won’t need this thing, but if she can’t, then it will be better to take some damage than to lose the competition and lose lives.”

As he spoke, Luo Haitang tried to give the chip and the journal to Han Sen again.

Han Sen didn’t take it. He looked at Luo Haitang and said, “I can understand your reasoning, but I still don’t need this.”

“Don’t be so stubborn, son. It has to do with the lives of your mother and sister. You have to compromise sometimes, no matter who you are.”

Han Sen shook his head. “I’ve told you that Little Yan is from my family. I’ll teach her myself, and as for this stuff, it belongs to your family. I don’t need the stuff from your family. Besides, you’re already dying inside. Something written by someone who’s dying inside will only hurt Little Yan if she reads it.”

Luo Haitang smiled, but he looked more solemn. He stared at Han Sen and said, “It seems I should show you the true power of a Falsified God. Then you’ll change your mind.”

“I’m not really a stubborn guy, but there’s no bargaining on this issue. I’ll never change my mind,” said Han Sen firmly.

“Just read it first.” Luo Haitang felt that he had wronged Luo Lan and Han Yan, which was why he was being very gentle when he was talking to Han Sen. Even Luo Haitang’s immediate family hadn’t seen him so good-tempered before.

Even so, Luo Haitang wanted to teach Han Sen something, but he didn’t want to do the young man harm. The more he looked at Han Sen, the more the young man seemed like Luo Lan.

It was more in their attitudes than their appearances. Once they’d made up their mind, nobody could change it. Others might hit a dead end and come back, but Luo Lan wouldn’t turn aside even if she ran into a brick wall.

Han Sen’s attitude reminded Luo Haitang of Luo Lan. That Lan Er, who he always scolded but always kept by his side.

Luo Haitang waved his hand and slapped toward Han Sen’s shoulders, and that strike contained the power of Falsified Sky.

Unlike Han Yan’s Falsified Sky power, Luo Haitang’s Falsified Sky power was already merged with his entire body, so it didn’t seem unbalanced. It was only an ordinary slap, the way friends might slap each other on the shoulders.

Han Sen suddenly looked solemn. Luo Haitang was as powerful as any super creature being in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.

To Han Sen, that simple slap seemed to bear the weight of endless karma, and that palm was destined to fall on his shoulder. Even deities wouldn’t be able to change anything.

All of a sudden, Han Sen ran the Dongxuan Sutra as hard as it would go, and he isolated his entire body from everything around him, and he tried to cast out every molecule that didn’t belong to him.

Even so, Han Sen could still feel that Luo Haitang’s palm might fall onto his shoulders at any second.

“Incredible. The force from the Dongxuan Sutra easily broke the Falsified Sky power from Luo Li, but it’s almost useless against Luo Haitang. No wonder he’s called Godslayer Luo.” Han Sen was amazed.

The aura from his body was operating fast, breaking the threshold. All of a sudden, the entire world looked completely different to Han Sen.

The maximum power of the Dongxuan Sutra was called “Covering the sky with one hand,” but it wasn’t only a technique of the hand.

With one step, the chain of order attached to Han Sen crumbled.

Han Sen took a step back from Luo Haitang’s palm, which stunned the old man. His palm froze in the sky, and he couldn’t say anything.

“Goodbye.” Han Sen took a bow, then he turned around and left.

He had finally seen the real Falsified-Sky Sutra, and he finally saw the true power of Luo Haitang.

When it came to strength, Luo Haitang was at the same level as Gu Qingcheng. Both of them were incredible beings, and it was difficult to tell which one was stronger.

Han Sen was weaker than they were, but he had also just proved that the Dongxuan Sutra was stronger than the Falsified-Sky Sutra.

Luo Haitang only realized what happened after Han Sen left the room. He looked at the empty doorway and whispered, “Lan Er, you have an incredible son. Perhaps the fate of our family will depend on him and his generation. Someone from the Luo family has actually gotten this powerful without practicing the Falsified-Sky Sutra. Others might not believe me if I tell them. How will the Jade Shura react if they see him?”

Suddenly, Luo Haitang smiled. “Interesting. I can’t believe I’m getting to see something this amazing before I die. Unfortunately, I won’t live to see the day when he is standing against the Jade Shura. What a shame.”

Right after Han Sen left Luo Haitang’s room, Luo Li joined him and asked, “What did you talk about with Godslayer Luo?”

“The same old issues. Why did you even ask? You already know,” said Han Sen.

“You’ve agreed that Han Yan can come to our family?” Luo Li was glad.

“Impossible! Han Yan is a member of the Han family, not one of you,” said Han Sen, disturbed.

“What?! How shallow you are. She’s from a different family, and it’s more than lucky for you to be able to practice the techniques of my family. How dare you think like that?” A furious voice came from behind them.

Han Sen followed the voice, and he saw Luo Yu, Luo Hui, and the others standing nearby. It was Luo Yu talking.

“No wonder Luo Haitang prefers me and Little Yan over everyone else in the Luo family. These people are so spoiled.” Han Sen shook his head, and he couldn’t even be bothered to care about what Luo Yu had said. He pretended that he didn’t hear anything, and he turned around and kept walking.

However, Luo Yan didn’t plan to let Han Sen go that easily. The group blocked Han Sen’s way.
