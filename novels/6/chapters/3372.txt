Chapter 3373 Accidents Happen

Qin Xiu started to frown. His face looked miserable. As he did so, he felt something stir and jump in the middle of his soul. By all accounts, it made Qin Xiu’s face look even more unpleasant.“Damn it!” The black crystal armor on Qin Xiu’s body was madly spinning. It was uncontrollable.

Katcha!

There were cracks all over Han Sen’s armor. Within them, a familiar power existed.

“It is her!” Han Sen was able to sense what that familiar power was. It was the presence he experienced when he had the geno prototype armor.

When that will went to Han Sen’s black crystal armor, the black crystal armor that surrounded Han Sen kept exuding a weird sort of power. It turned into something that could help Han Sen.

Han Sen was very happy about this. He quickly gathered power and threw a punch at Qin Xiu ahead of him.

Qin Xiu accepted the strike, which sent his body flying through the air and into space. His body flew back 400 miles before starting it started to descend.

Qin Xiu froze. He looked at Han Sen with a look of disbelief. Rather, he was not even really looking at Han Sen. He was looking at the black crystal armor Han Sen was wearing.

“Chaos, did you give up fighting me with the geno prototype for him?” Qin Xiu looked shocked as he stopped all movements. He started to look mad. He stared at Han Sen and the black crystal armor.

Han Sen’s black crystal armor disassembled. After it fell off of him, it recomposed itself. It rebuilt itself as a bodiless black crystal armor that seemed more fitting for a woman. The black crystal armor was now the same as the one Han Sen knew in the beginning, except the armor now looked livelier.

The woman in the black crystal armor looked at Qin Xiu and said, “Oh, you are the worst villain I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Your actions never make any sense, and you just force your way into places you shouldn’t belong, raising the stupid stakes. After everything, now you’re just moaning and moaning. Why are you moaning? Isn’t this what you wanted? Haven’t you always wanted this and everything going on in this place? Well, now you have it.”

After that, the woman in the black crystal armor looked at Han Sen and commented, “Han Sen, would you look at that? We meet again.”

“Are you the leader of the God Chaos Party?” Although Han Sen already knew her identity, he still asked the question.

“I am Chaos,” she said. “You have my will. You have seen the remnant of my soul. You should already know me.”

Han Sen wished to say something. Before he could, Chaos went on to say, “Now is not the time for talk. You and I should kill him now. If we do this now, it will be the best chance we have.”

Before Han Sen said anything, Qin Xiu was already coldly saying, “Chaos, you relinquished your control of the geno prototype. Do you really think you can beat me with your measly amount of power?”

“I can’t, but together we can,” Chaos said. Her body went to Han Sen. The black crystal armor wrapped up Han Sen’s body.

As the black crystal armor wrapped up Han Sen, Chaos’ voice was in Han Sen’s brain. “Let me handle your body. This body has an incredible amount of power. With my control power, along with using this body, we can kill Qin Xiu, who has the geno prototype armor. That way, we can prevent the need for Bao’er to fight him.”

“Sure. What do you need me to do?” Han Sen had no doubts about letting Chaos do what was needed to protect Bao’er.

“Just let your body go. Allow me to control all of this.” Chaos’s voice echoed through Han Sen’s brain again. Han Sen’s body madly shook. It combined with the black crystal armor.

The black armor suddenly looked transparent like Han Sen’s body did. It was like a diamond glowing with a god light.

Han Sen felt his will clearly. He could control his body, but his body was also being controlled by a different will. That felt particularly amazing. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It was like playing a video game when one used two controllers to control one character. Even so, it was a bit different from that. Han Sen was not controlling anything, but he felt everything the body was feeling.

Qin Xiu seemed to sense he was now a major threat. He looked very serious. The black crystal armor’s power started to spin and push his power to the max.

“Ah, Chaos. Tut-tut-tut, Chaos. You silly, silly girl. You naughty, naughty girl. You always were bold, but I fear I have always held you in higher regard than you deserve. It turns out you are pretty naïve if you think that petty body has what it takes to defeat me and the geno prototype I look awesome wearing.” Qin Xiu’s body grew stronger. Space around was affected by his power, and it all started to twist.

Countless weird scenes were around him, creating something like a mirage.

Chaos coldly said, “You are the naive one. I created the geno prototype armor. No one can understand it more than I, but you do not know how scary this body is.”

“So, what? Even if your body is really strong, do you really think he can break through the last stage?” Qin Xiu looked at her with disdain.

“Everything is possible,” Chaos coldly said. She then stepped forward.

Her step made it seem like the whole world was following her feet. That transparent power was going for Qin Xiu.

“You created the geno prototype armor, but there is only one person who can push its power to the max. That person is me.” Qin Xiu looked cold. He did not falter or take a step back. His body surged with an incredible black power.

The two powers collided in the 33rd sky. The whole of the 33rd sky became a half-black and a half-transparent weird world.

“You are right,” Chaos said. “Only you can push the power of the geno prototype armor to the max, but it is a shame you have not achieved that yet. You have the geno prototype armor, but your body is not Reboot class yet. You yourself have not made that last step. So, today, you will only die. You will not be reincarnated.” She took another step forward.

Katcha!

The half-black world started to collapse and break when Chaos stepped forward.

Chaos kept walking toward Qin Xiu. With every step she took, the black power collapsed a lot. Qin Xiu’s power kept exploding, but he could not prevent Chaos from walking forward.

“How is that possible? Is there a body that can take such steps?” Qin Xiu’s face started to change, but he suddenly smiled again. He said to himself, “It is no wonder this is Wan’er.”

“Qin Xiu, die!” Chaos was not going to permit Qin Xiu to have another chance. She stepped forward. All of the dark power collapsed. Qin Xiu’s black crystal armor displayed many cracks. It looked like it could collapse at any second. Chaos’s fist was being thrust toward Qin Xiu’s skull.

It felt like the whole world relied on that one punch. It carried an incredible power.

Qin Xiu was suppressed by the power of the whole world, but his body was still standing very straight. He had no fear. He smiled and closed his eyes. “Chaos, to be able to kill me, it won’t be you. Only Wan’er can kill me in this world. I owe her that much.”

“Just die already!” Chaos did not move. The punch was still madly going toward him.

Bzzt!

When Chaos’s punch was about to hit Qin Xiu’s head, it suddenly stopped. Chaos’s body started to shake.

“Oh, no!” Han Sen sensed what was going on.

It was Wan’er’s will. The body did not just belong to Han Sen. It belonged to Wan’er too, who was Qin Xiu’s little sister. This girl had given up so much for Qin Xiu, so she was not going to let her body be the one to kill Qin Xiu.
