Chapter 3380 Weird Body

“Weird.” Han Yufei examined Han Sen in various ways. After a while, her eyes seemed brighter. She was holding a laptop, continuously reading the statistics that appeared on the screen.

Han Sen emerged from the test chamber and asked Han Yufei, “Do you mind telling me what you found that is so weird?”

Han Yufei’s discovery was not as scary or concerning as Han Sen thought. She had only been doing ordinary tests. Mostly, she had just taken samples from his body and blood.

Han Yufei looked at the test results and said, “Your body is fine. There does not seem to be any issues.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“If it is fine, why am I no longer able to feel my powers?” Han Sen asked with a frown.

Han Yufei raised her head. She looked at Han Sen’s body with interest. “That is the problem. Everything about your body is normal. It is too normal. Therein lies the problem.”

“Can you try saying something I might understand?” Han Sen had a wry smile.

“How about this? Your body is like a human from the geno universe who has only just arrived here. The fitness level and data are all at a very basic, average standard. According to this standard, you are at the lowest tier a creature of the universe can be. Any creature that practices will be stronger than you.”

After that, Han Yufei put her hand on Han Sen’s head and squeezed his cheeks. As she did this, she said, “I have performed a few simple pressure tests on your body. The results of the pressure tests tell me your body is normal too. There were no changes. All of the tests indicate no change. If I did not double check the machine and realize there weren’t any problems, I would think the machine was broken, and all the data and test results were nonsense.”

“Take a look at yourself, Doc. You are some freaky scientist surrounded by test tubes and laptops displaying non-sensical data all day. While I feel thrilled, perhaps almost privileged, you think so highly of my intelligence that I can keep up with the gibberish you consistently spout like a cliche, I have to confess and admit that I do not have a clue about what you are saying. So how about slowing it down a bit and explaining things a bit better? What does all this mean?” Han Sen did not understand this.

Han Yufei touched Han Sen’s chest muscles. With eyes that looked like they were on fire, she said, “Well, the average temperature of a human is around 98.6. According to the environmental temperatures, your body adjusts. Everyone can adjust, but there is a limit to how far one’s body can adjust. If your temperature swings too far, your body could end up shutting down. You’ll be in a very bad state. You, however, maintain your temperature. No matter how bad the conditions are, your state remains. That is very shocking.”

“We need to conduct some stronger pressure tests to confirm how far your level is,” Han Yufei said. “After that, we can make judgments.”

Han Sen’s eyes looked bright. “Are you saying my body is not affected by environmental factors? Does that mean no power can harm me?”

Han Yufei shook her head. “According to my theory, yes. Judging from the data collected via my tests, it is not like the theory suggests. Sometimes, your body is very stable. At other times, it is too normal. With your test results, if a Break World beast tries to chop you up, your body should not be harmed. But when I use a needle to pierce through your skin and your private part, that goes right against the theory.”

“Is it just my body in a state of adjustment?” Han Sen asked.

Han Yufei replied, “That is possible, but I cannot be entirely certain. The maximum and minimum yield too much of a difference. Usually, there should not be a big gap.”

After that, Han Yufei pulled Han Sen into another lab. She walked and said, “I need more data to be more accurate with this stuff. Let’s just continue our tests.”

Han Sen wanted to reject her, but Han Yufei did not care. She dragged him into the lab.

Han Sen was thrust into a test chamber. He saw many mechanical arms come toward his body. They were all clutching all sorts of tools and needles.

“Han Yufei, are you going to cut me open for your research?” Seeing so many machines, Han Sen’s head felt an itch.

“Do not worry. Living test subjects are always better than dead test subjects,” Han Yufei coldly said. She then operated the machines and had them come even closer to Han Sen’s body.

Han Sen felt a needle prod into his skin. He felt as if there was even more than one. The pain was not severe, but it still made him feel rather depressed.

Suddenly, Han Sen had a flare of goosebumps develop. His body started to tighten. He suddenly exploded with a strange sort of power that blasted all the machinery and mechanical gizmos away. The entire test chamber exploded. All the fluids and pieces of stuff pinged away everywhere.

“Han Yufei, are you trying to do a test or trick me?” Han Sen stared at Han Yufei. He felt a needle go into the important part of a male body. His body reacted, and that had the power explode to destroy everything.

Han Yufei put down the umbrella she had used to shield herself from the mess. She pointed to all the bits and pieces on the floor as she said, “If I did not give you some excitement, how was I supposed to tell whether or not your body had a problem? Now that you are fine, we can prove your power is still inside you. You just have a problem feeling it is there.”

Han Sen was shocked. He looked at the machine pieces, bent needles, and drills. He then looked at his body.

Earlier, he was only just complaining. He did not think much. His body should not have been able to unleash that much power on a whim. Whatever happened earlier resulted in the release of some power that was beyond what his body should have been able to do.

He wanted to feel it again, but he could not feel the power anymore.

“Weird. What is wrong with my body? Am I only allowed to have this power when I feel something exciting? This is so weird. It is like some legendary sort of body type.” Han Sen glumly looked at his body.

“It is simple enough to know the answers,” Han Yufei said. “We must continue testing!”

“Cough, cough. Maybe next time. For now, I am busy. I will come back later.” Upon imaging his private parts hurting, Han Sen immediately refused Han Yufei. No matter what she said to him, he did not want to do any more tests with her. So he put his clothes on and left.

Although the pain had not been too bad for Han Sen, it did not feel great either.

“If I just need excitement, I can just conduct my own tests. I do not need that devil.” Han Sen ran away from the lab because he was afraid of the mad scientist, Han Yufei.

Seeing Han Sen escape, Han Yufei did not plan on pursuing him. She opened her palm and held a broken needle.

The contents in the needle made Han Yufei’s lips develop a weird smile.

After Han Sen left the lab, he went straight to Zero. He thought, “Wanting excitement is easy. I should just ask Zero to chop me a few times.”
