Chapter 1569: Luo Family’s Gift

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xu Mi followed Han Sen out of Furnace Shelter. He was going to travel with him as a student. Han Sen wasn’t very good at teaching, but even if he only took the time to teach Xu Mi some skills of the Alliance, it would be enough.

Compared to human education, what spirits received was pretty much rubbish.

Spirits could live forever, so they could learn what they wanted whenever they wanted. There was no need for efficiency and proper timetabling.

Humans weren’t like that, of course. In ancient times, it was said that it was rare for humans to see the age of seventy. That was considered a very old age, but a human’s learning capabilities declined after the age of thirty, anyway. Therefore, a core principle for humanity was the need for studying effectively and in a timely manner.

Humans always tried to find the best ways to learn and absorb knowledge in the shortest amount of time. There were many different ways to study, but all of them were highly organized. This had been very important in ancient times.

It didn’t matter whether someone went to a public school or went to a private martial hall; the education they received had been refined for millennia. It was far better than anything spirits ever received.

Han Sen did not think it would be difficult to teach Xu Mi. He asked the AI to formulate a plan and course of education for Xu Mi, too.

There were humans in Furnace Shelter, but no one really ever listened to them. Xu Mi certainly wouldn’t, especially since he was emperor-class. He had never taken the time to learn how humans studied. What Han Sen presented him with was all new. It fascinated him, and he put a lot of effort into studying as hard as he could.

Luo Li, Luo Yu, and Luo Hui looked weirded out. They thought Han Sen’s teaching method was so dull and average. They expected him to teach Xu Mi something grand and powerful. After seeing this, they wondered why Xu Mi would have such great respect for him.

They could not understand why Furnace Emperor and Fire Empress had treated Han Sen so well, either.

But still, they kept their thoughts to themselves. They were a bit scared of Han Sen, and they did not want to criticize him.

“Han Sen, why don’t you come to Godslayer Shelter with us?” After they left the Valley of Sand, Luo Li invited Han Sen to come back with them.

“I’m going back to my own shelter. Take care.” Han Sen was not a fan of the Luo family, and so he didn’t want to stick with them very long. He brought the silver fox, Xu Mi, and the rest to leave with him.

Jia Shidao knew the Luo family’s relationship with Han Sen was strained. He didn’t say anything regarding that, but he did think to himself, “It’s difficult to discern the intricacies of genes. I am afraid the Luo family will fall, and when it does, the Han family will rise to supersede them. Maybe Han Sen will one day become better than Luo Haitang himself. It looks like the Iron Fist Martial Hall will need to morph to accommodate the coming change.”

Han Sen brought Xu Mi with him to his shelter. His new guest was a second-gen super spirit, so no creatures or spirits gave them any trouble on the return trip.

Han Sen did not go back to God’s Ruin, and Xu Mi told them the place was shut down now, anyway. It would be many decades before it reopened.

Little Lion King had gone back to Lion Mountain, so there was no point going back there, either.

“What are those crystal cacti in the Valley of Sand?” Han Sen asked Xu Mi.

Xu Mi smiled and said, “It is a super creature. It isn’t a normal one, though, and it is actually called Cactus Needle. My parents spent a lot of time trying to claim it, so it could stand guard and protect the shelter. The crystal cactus branch you broke in the beginning was just an illusion. It didn’t affect the real creature. Unless you find its real body and kill it, it can just keep on summoning illusions like that. The illusions are all strong, just like super creatures, too. It makes for a powerful ally.”

“That is a very powerful super creature, indeed. It doesn’t sound any weaker than a berserk super creature, actually,” Han Sen complimented it.

“Yeah. If it wasn’t, I don’t think my parents would have exerted as much effort as they did when they claimed it.” Xu Mi spoke of this proudly.

They returned to Shadow Shelter before long, and Han Sen settled Xu Mi down there. Han Sen then called on Cheap Sheep and Green Cow to give him a sitrep on the shelter, so he could learn how things had been and if any important events had unfolded in his absence.

“Bossman, with us here, the shelter has been doing fine.” Cheap Sheep continued to compliment himself and tell Han Sen how well he had performed. And he really had done well. He had done a great job while Han Sen was gone and kept everything operational. Han Sen was satisfied.

Red Pony was still in the garden, but Nine-Life Cat was gone. Where it went, Han Sen had no clue, but it never returned.

Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon remained comfortably in the shelter, and it seemed as if they weren’t keen on the concept of leaving.

Gu Qingcheng rarely left the shelter, but Elysian Moon frequently did. She came back from time to time, but she never communicated with Han Sen. She would always come back and return to Gu Qingcheng’s side.

Han Sen wanted to ask Gu Qingcheng a few questions and see if she was the Number 4 mentioned in the diary, but after thinking it over for a while, he decided to go back to the Alliance first. He wanted to see his family and his son. Han Sen had been gone for a long time, and he had missed them quite a bit.

“It is a shame Littleflower is too young and cannot go to the shelter. And I don’t have enough power to ensure Ji Yanran could become a demi-god safely. The whole family could hunt creatures together if we were all here, and we’d see each other a lot more.” Han Sen sighed.

When he went home, though, Han Sen thought something in the atmosphere had soured. Luolan and Ji Yanran were already there waiting for him, and when they saw him, they looked at him as if he was a criminal.

“Has something happened?” Han Sen asked quickly.

“Nothing has happened, but you have a big problem.” Luolan looked at Han Sen as if she was a judge, and she spoke with alarming seriousness.

“What problem do I have?” Han Sen did not understand.

“You went to Godslayer Shelter?” Luolan asked.

Han Sen nodded. “I was on my way through. Due to a business arrangement, I had to go. But don’t you worry, I haven’t established any ties to them. It’s done.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Looking very angry, Luolan pointed to the gift box on the table. She said, “If nothing happened, then why did Old Stubbornness send these things here?”

“Old Stubbornness? You mean Luo Haitang? What did he send here? Does he want to teach Han Yan some horrible skill again? I’m telling you, she shouldn’t learn that stuff. It’ll harm her lifespan,” Han Sen said quickly.

Luolan shook her head and said, “These were my favorite snacks. After all these years, he still remembers. You better tell me what you did with him. There’s no way that Old Stubbornness would concede to me and ask Luo Li to deliver these things. Luo Li brought it, but there were some items in there she didn’t know about. It must have been his idea.”

Luolan said she’d never go back to see the Luo family again, but when Luo Haitang sent her those things, it made her feel weird. She was both touched and confused. After so many years, Luo Haitang finally understood. He didn’t come, but the items he had included obviously meant a lot. Luolan didn’t believe someone with Luo Haitang’s personality would do this.

But Luolan was worried Han Sen had sacrificed something, which prompted the gesture.
