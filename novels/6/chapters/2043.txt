Chapter 2044 Dragon Corpse

The battle continued to rage upon the surface of the sea. Fortunately, it had little effect on the ocean depths.

Suddenly, there was a boom and something massive fell into the sea.

Han Sen quickly looked towards it through the scope. The xenogeneic Dragon God had fallen, kicking up goliath waves. Even the sea bed was affected as the churning water raised swirls of sand and debris.

It seemed that the Dragon God had lost consciousness. Its body sank, and when Han Sen saw its head, he noted that its skull had been cracked. The hammer-wielding turtle had probably plonked it pretty hard.

“Sh*t! That dual-hammer turtle is that strong?” Han Sen was shocked.

The dual-hammer turtle quickly dropped into the sea after the Dragon God. The hammer came down to strike the Dragon God’s head again, and what was left of its skull was sundered. The turtle snatched a blue orb out of the monster’s remains and swam away.

The Dragon God’s body slowly sank through the water until it came down near Han Sen.

A while passed, and the dual-hammer turtle did not return. Xius and Dragon Fifteen arrived next to the corpse.

“Xius, do you know what this creature is?” Dragon Fifteen asked Xius.

Xius looked at the Dragon God’s body and said, “I’m not sure, but its power should be the equivalent of something half- deified. The dual-hammer turtle already took the most important item, but the body of the beast itself should still prove useful. Its blue scales, especially so. If what Long Shan said was true, and the scales can speed up one’s evolution, then they will be a prized treasure.”

“I was thinking the same thing! It is lucky for the Dragon. Long Ying, quickly prep the body for transport,” Dragon Fifteen said to Long Ying.

Long Ying nodded and swam closer to the Dragon God’s body. She tried to pick it up.

Han Sen watched her work, regretting that there was nothing he could do. He couldn’t beat Long Ying in a fight, so he couldn’t interfere. A half-deified’s body was a valuable treasure, but he valued his own life more.

But when Long Ying came down next to the Dragon God’s body and grabbed its tail, her Duke powers were not enough to lift the corpse.

Long Ying’s face changed. She spread her dragon wings to emit the shadow of a dragon. Her arms transformed into the scaly limbs of a dragon. She managed to shift the body a little, but she was unable to lift it.

“Fifteen, this xenogeneic’s body is too heavy. We need more assistance if we want to move it,” Long Ying told Dragon Fifteen.

Dragon Fifteen frowned, and then he said, “In that case, Xius and I will watch the body while you go and find help.”

That evil crystallizer might still be around. How about I stay here and you go for help?” Long Ying did not want to leave Dragon Fifteen unprotected.

“It’s fine. You go,” Dragon Fifteen said, waving his hands dismissively. He wanted to get this done as soon as possible.

Seeing Long Ying leave, though, Han Sen was delighted. If it was just Dragon Fifteen and Xius—two Marquises—he might have a chance to nab the spoils.

But he still had to consider the weight of the Dragon God’s body. Not even Long Ying’s Duke strength could lift it. Even if Han Sen summoned his Destiny’s Tower, he doubted that he could absorb it and take it away.

“What can I steal?” Han Sen used his scope to examine the body, but he didn’t know much about the creature. He couldn’t tell if what he was seeing was actually good stuff.

“Long Shan and the others said that its scales can speed up the evolution process, so the scales have to be decent, at least. But it has too many scales for me to try to grab them all. Before I finished harvesting it, Long Ying would be back with help. And then, I certainly would not be able to run. Xius and Dragon Fifteen are here, as well, and they are annoying enough.” Han Sen was hesitating.

At this time, Xius walked in front of the Dragon God’s body. Observing the creature’s neck, she said, “I don’t know where this xenogeneic might have come from, but from its appearance, we can determine that it is definitely some sort of dragon. Aside from the dragon orb that the turtle stole, the most important thing for us to take would be the scales. Do you agree?”

Hearing what Xius said, Han Sen turned his scope in the direction she was looking. He saw a scale on the Dragon God’s neck that appeared to be growing upside-down. The other scales were light blue, but this one was so dark that it was almost black. It also seemed to be shaped differently than the other scales.

The other scales looked like fans, and they were the size of grinding discs. That Upside-Down Scale, however, was only around the size of a plate. It was shaped like a heart.

“Not bad. This half-deified xenogeneic is one of the Dragon. That is the Upside-Down Scale.” Dragon Fifteen walked over to the body and tried to tear off the scale.

But when he grabbed the scale by its edges, he was unable to remove it. Dragon God was dead, and its lifeforce was gone. The flesh had certainly weakened. But even so, it seemed that a Marquise would have difficulty removing the Upside-Down Scale.

Dragon Fifteen frowned. Power swelled within his body as he spread his wings. He grew three feet taller, and his muscles hardened like steel. His scales all turned black.

“Good grief. This Dragon Fifteen is a xenogeneic. Are all Dragons xenogeneics, I wonder?” Han Sen thought to himself.

Watching this display, Han Sen thought that Dragon Fifteen might have been more powerful than Dragon Thirteen. The Dragon were born strong, and any pure Dragon could become stronger than those of any other race. Their claim of being the bravest was not some bluff. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

His nails became blades, and Dragon Fifteen poked them into the flesh beside the scale. He cut around the scale and it popped loose.

“F*ck! That’s it.” Han Sen was angry. He aimed Spell at Dragon Fifteen and pulled the trigger. He emerged from the shell and ran towards the Dragon God’s corpse.

Dragon Fifteen seemed to be ready. He gave a hum, then swung his hand at the bullet fired from Spell. The bullet was cut in half, then exploded.

As this occurred, Dragon Fifteen waved his other hand at Han Sen. The talons shook the water into a number of blades that headed towards Han Sen.
