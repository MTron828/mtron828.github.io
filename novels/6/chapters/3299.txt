“Sister Keer, do you have time to walk around out there today?” A young man of the Very High looked elegant as he went in front of Li Keer. He smiled at her warmly.

“I do not have time.” Li Keer rejected the advance. She seemed very annoyed.

Since her Very High Sense had not broken through, the race wanted her to get married as fast as she could to start producing babies and continue the dwindling bloodline of the Very High. There was a young man named Li Yan. He was the other half in a betrothal the families had organized on their behalf.

Li Yan looked awful. He glumly said, “Li Keer, you better figure this out. This was a decision made by the elders. I am forced to be going through this with you as well. What kind of attitude are you showing here?”

Li Keer coldly said, “If you do not like it that much, then go and complain to the elders or the leader. Maybe you can get them to cancel this whole thing and save yourself the trouble.”

Li Keer was annoyed. The last thing she wanted to do was get married.

When Li Yan heard what she had to say, he looked even worse. “Do you think I am not aware of the fact that you are obsessed with Dollar? It is such a shame that Dollar is Han Sen, and Han Sen is a dead man. Even if he is not dead, like the rumors say, he is Exquisite’s silkworm. He had no connection with you. In the beginning, you wanted Dollar to be your silkworm, but he ignored your plight for the longest time. Why must you torture yourself this much?”

Li Yan wasn’t a core member of the Very High. He was just a tool. The last time Han Sen went to the Very High, he saw Very High Leader and Space Garden’s people. Li Yan did not know if the rumor about Han Sen having made that return was the truth or not.

Li Keer just ignored him and departed.

Li Yan was a bit angry. He yanked Li Keer by the hand and said, “Stand right there, Li Keer. I am telling you, no matter whether you are willing to or not, I am the only person you will ever marry. This is a rule of the Very High. No one can disobey the law. You will not be an exception.”

Li Keer looked upset. She turned around and pushed his hands off her. She wanted to say something, but she stopped. She looked back to where she was looking. She saw a man approach.

When Li Keer saw the man, her body shook. She peered at the man with a look of utter disbelief.

As Han Sen approached, he heard Li Keer and Li Yan’s conversation. He walked up to Li Keer and said, “Keer, if you do not want to get married, I can talk to your leader. Perhaps they will cancel the arrangement.”

Before Li Keer spoke, Li Yan coldly asked, “Who are you? How can you dare to interfere in the business of the Very High?”

“I cannot interfere with the business of the Very High Leader, but I can certainly impart an opinion or two.” After saying that, Han Sen turned to Li Keer and said, “Keer, are Littleflower and the others here in Outer Sky? Why did not I see them at the base?”

Li Keer nodded. “They built a new base. I will take you there.”

“Stop right there! Who are you?” Li Yan thought Han Sen was Li Fei. Based on what he had said, he obviously did not know about the Mirror Lake base.

Thinking about that, he thought Han Sen was just a man invading Outer Sky. According to the laws of the Very High, he had to take all invaders down.

Li Keer looked at Li Yan. She lifted her lips and said, “He is not someone great. He is the dead person you just mentioned. Are you interested in killing him again?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Li Yan was shocked. When he realized what had happened, his face changed. He looked at Han Sen with suspicion. “Li Keer, do you just want to find a random guy to disguise himself as Dollar? Do you really think I am three years old? Who in this universe does not know about Dollar and Qin Xiu dying together? The rumor about Dollar not being dead was just a joke.”

Li Keer laughed and looked at Han Sen. “He does not believe you are Dollar. Perhaps you should prove him wrong.”

“I do not have anything to prove. I am Dollar, and that is that. I will give him a coin.” Han Sen placed his index finger and middle finger together. He manifested a coin in the slot between them. He tossed the coin to Li Yan.

Li Yan did not know if this was Han Sen or not. He did not take the coin.

While he was moving away, the coin approached slowly and still managed to land on him.

Li Yan’s face changed. He generated power. He wanted to blast the coin away, but the coin hit his fist. It was like it was superglued to the knuckle.

Boom!

Li Yan’s body became heavy. The ground around his feet cracked. It was as if he was carrying a mountain. It looked like he was about to sink and be crushed.

“Let’s go. It has been a while since I last saw Littleflower. I would like to see him.” Han Sen put his hand on Li Keer’s shoulder and teleported to Mirror Lake.

“Sister Keer...” Han Yan, outside the base, saw Li Keer. She said hello, but Han Sen, who was next to Li Keer, was frozen upon seeing her. His eyes turned red.

“Brother, you are back!” Han Yan was very happy and hugged Han Sen.

Han Sen stroked her head and smiled. “Why are you still like a kid? When are you going to grow up?”

“Why would I grow up? I want to be the much-adored kid forever.” Han Yan laughed.

“But you are already an auntie. Do you really not feel ashamed for saying something like that?” Han Sen rubbed her on the nose.

Han Yan laughed. “What is wrong with being an auntie? You can still be loved and have a good nephew. Littleflower is smart and a gentleman. He is stronger than you. By the way, Littleflower is in the base. I will take you to him. I can only imagine how much you miss him.”

Han Yan led Han Sen and Li Keer to the base. She pushed the door open and saw Han Yufei wearing a long robe. She had gold glasses on.

“Why are you back?” Han Yufei pushed up her gold glasses and looked at Han Sen.

“I am free, so I decided to come back.” Han Sen rubbed his nose.

“That is good. I need your help with a test I am working on. Come with me.” After Han Yufei said that, she went down a corridor and walked into an elevator.

Han Sen followed. He wanted to know what Han Yufei was doing.

The elevator went all the way down to the base before stopping. There was a big door outside the elevator. Han Yufei typed in a few passwords to open it.

Han Sen saw a giant egg-shaped thing. He was confused as he asked, “What is this?”

That egg-shaped thing was 30 feet tall. It was unknown what kind of high-level technology was involved in its creation. It did not look like metal. It did not look like wood or stone. It looked like a crystal with lots of veins inside. One was able to see lights passing through them.

“I call this machine the rebirth machine.” Han Yufei pushed her gold glasses and looked cocky.

“A rebirth machine?” Han Sen looked weird as he asked. “Can this machine control what sort of baby a future parent is going to have?”

Han Yufei lifted her lips and said, “It is nothing so simple. The rebirth machine can modify genes. For example, when a male sperm enters a female’s egg, it can have its genes adjusted. Then, the baby can decide what gene it would prefer to receive.”

“Isn’t that just a geno baby?” Han Sen asked. “The Alliance did something like this a long time ago.”

“Of course not. My rebirth machine is not just human to human.” Han Yufei sinisterly smiled.
