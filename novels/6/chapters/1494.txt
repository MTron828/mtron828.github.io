Chapter 1495: Berserk Super Beast Soul

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The crab was reeling in agony, and the tension in its pincers relaxed as a result. Because of this, the eel was able to recollect its diamond arrow. The eel had been bullied by the crab the whole time, but now it had an opportunity for retaliation. It fired its arrow at its foe without hesitation.

The crab, in the pain it was suffering, could do little more than flail its pincers. The arrow found its target, plunging itself neatly into the crab’s second eye. Both of its eye had been rendered blind, and having lost its vision, the crab had to rely on everything it could feel.

Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to hide his movement, meaning the crab couldn’t detect him at all.

With red Taia in his hand, Han Sen returned to its other eye and stabbed it to deliver more anguish. The crab, unable to feel its attacker, continued to flail its claws in futile resistance.

The eel’s arrow was co-operating with Han Sen to bring an end to the crab. The crab wished to flee now, but it was too late for that. The next time it was loosed, the eel’s thunder arrow pierced directly into the crab’s body. It made the crab spew blood from its mouth.

Han Sen summoned his strength and ran into the crab’s other broken eye. He waved Taia like mad, trying to bring ruin to the insides of the crab.

But the crab’s vitality was very good. In the weakest spot Han Sen could find, despite using both Taia and the super geno core, he was only able to deal a minor amount of damage. He couldn’t inflict fatal wounds.

Han Sen and the diamond arrow were still free to work, though, and they were slowly able to destroy the inside of the crab’s body. The eel itself was continuing to fire geysers of lightning. After half a day of this, the big crab stopped moving.

Han Sen had been slashing non-stop like a madman. He was afraid if the crab’s final blow was delivered by the eel, he’d walk away empty-handed.

Seeing that the crab was no longer moving, Han Sen didn’t stop, though. He used the power of Super Spank to deliver a firm hit to its brain.

Although he was unable to break the crab’s sequence structure, the blow was enough to deal hearty damage to it. And at the same time, the diamond arrow was in the creature’s body, controlled telepathically by the eel. It seemed like the eel was eager to slay the crab, too.

After a while, Han Sen heard an announcement play in his head.

“Berserk Super Creature Gold-Patterned Crab King killed. Beast soul gained. Geno Core unobtained. Flesh is edible, and you may harvest its Life Geno Essence.”

Han Sen was very happy. This was a very good super creature, and he had actually managed to obtain its beast soul. Even the eel might have been a berserk super creature.

In Han Sen’s delight, he suddenly felt lightning course through the crab. Han Sen knew he’d have to get away from its body.

The eel looked at Han Sen, then used its entire body to grab hold of the lifeless crab and pull it deep down into the sea.

Han Sen felt it was a great shame that the crab king’s body and Life Geno Essence had been claimed by the eel, but he knew he couldn’t fight the creature. So, he had no choice but to let it go. Still, he knew he was lucky enough to obtain a berserk super beast soul.

Han Sen looked into the Sea of Soul, eager to find out what the crab king’s beast soul was like.

“It looks like an armor-type beast soul. That’d be great if it was. The defense of a berserk super creature is incredibly strong, and that would mean I wouldn’t have to be afraid of super creatures and king spirits anymore,” Han Sen thought to himself, as he looked at the Gold-Patterned Crab King beast soul.

Berserk Super Beast Soul Gold-Patterned Crab King: Arm Shield

“Arm Shield?” Han Sen was surprised. A shield beast soul wasn’t incredibly rare, but it wasn’t common, either. Han Sen used to have a shield super beast soul, but he ended up trading it for weapons.

Arm Shield-type beast souls were rare. This was the first one he had ever received. He had seen other people make use of them, but he always believed ordinary shields to be better.

“It’s a berserk super beast soul, though. It has to be something special,” Han Sen thought, then he summoned the king crab shield.

Han Sen saw a purple crab appear on his arm, one that was around the size of a plate. Han Sen thought it was a mini king crab, but it was the arm shield.

“It’s so small. I can’t defend much with this. I wish it was bigger.” Han Sen frowned. The defensive properties would be too small. It might be able to block swords, but not AOE-type attacks.

Han Sen thought of that, and then he suddenly saw the shield expand. It became something like a grinding wheel.

Han Sen was so happy. “This thing can grow in size? Can it get even bigger?”

As Han Sen thought of this, the shield grew even bigger. But it also got heavier when this happened, which made it difficult for him to carry.

Not long after, the crab king shield became as big as a house. It was too heavy for Han Sen to lift, so he set it down on the ground to let it grow.

Luckily, the shield’s growth limit was not infinite. When it reached the size of the king crab the beast soul belonged to, it stopped growing. With all of Han Sen’s power, he was unable to pick it up.

“Why can’t I see the gold word overbearing?” Han Sen wondered, seeing the absence of that golden word.

Although the shield looked good, without the word overbearing on the back, it wasn’t perfect.

Han Sen reverted it back to its smallest size, and it looked like an ordinary crab had latched onto his arm. As he examined it, he suddenly saw a swordfish approaching him.

The crab had died, and the eel had gone. The creatures that had previously lived here were now on their way back. Thinking Han Sen looked like food, they decided to attack him.

The swordfish was coming at Han Sen like an arrow. He didn’t dodge, though. He raised his arm shield and turned it into a grinding wheel before deflecting the swordfish.

“Let’s try out the defense of this arm shield,” Han Sen was thinking. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The swordfish should have been a sacred-blood creature. At that high speed, it looked like a javelin coming directly towards the arm shield.

Pang!

The moment the swordfish hit the arm shield, Han Sen imbued the shield with power and it flashed gold. And at that point, the word overbearing appeared.

The swordfish’s body blew up, following that hit, dying the water around it red.

“Sacred-blood Creature Shockfish killed. No beast soul gained. Geno Core shattered. Eat the flesh to gain zero-to-ten geno points randomly.”

Han Sen was frozen. He knew that a sacred-blood creature wouldn’t be able to break the shield, but he hadn’t expected the fish to explode after just hitting it.
