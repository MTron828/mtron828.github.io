Chapter 3379 Nothing

As he watched God leave, Han Sen looked surprised. He shook his head. “It is pointless to think about these things too much. I just need to be myself more.”

Han Sen kept looking around for Break World beasts. He wanted his Break World tally to reach a hundred to see if his Super God Spirit mode might exhibit positive changes.

After killing a few Break World beasts, Han Sen thought his Break World gene tally would hit a hundred. The results made him wonder.

When his Break World gene number reached 99, he consumed two more Break World genes. They did not, however, increase his Break World gene tally.

“Is it because the Break World rate of these Break World genes is not high enough? Does the final Break World gene just require more juice?” Han Sen did not know, so he had to continues his search for Break World beasts.

He swallowed a few more Break World genes, but the results were the same every time. He did not get any more Break World genes.

Han Sen had been thinking about whether or not he should give up hunting Break World beasts. When he killed the next Break World beast, he heard a familiar sound after he swallowed the Break World gene

“Break World gene plus one.”

Han Sen was happy. Before he had any other ideas, he heard another sound.

“Evolution requirement reached. Super God Spirit mode is evolving.”

In the next second, Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode started. He turned into a spirit body. This time, his Super God Spirit body was different. Aside from his Super God Spirit body, the four geno arts started running.

Han Sen felt the power of the four geno arts start changing. The Break World rate was increasing, and his body was changing.

These effects were affecting his Super God Spirit body.

In the past, the Super God Spirit body did its own thing. It would not combine with other powers. It would not be affected by other powers.

This time, the Super God Spirit body felt as if it was infected. The spirit body’s mode exhibited tangible changes.

Blood-Pulse Sutra was there, and it made the blood of the Super God Spirit body solid. It was no longer just an empty spirit body.

Wherever Jadeskin’s power reached, it made ice jade-like skin appear.

Wherever the Dongxuan Sutra reached, every inch of the soul-like body seemed to change. The Story of Genes’ power made the spirit body become closer to being a body.

Han Sen felt his body become incredibly itchy. It was like a wound that had scabbed over with the production of new flesh. It did not hurt, but it felt rather awful. It made him really want to scratch himself all over.

Han Sen knew he could not scratch things right now. If he tried to do anything, he would only end up interfering with the evolution process of his body. He had to resist the urges he had.

His entire body felt as if countless bugs were crawling all over. His body was growing flesh. Even his bones were visible.

If someone saw Han Sen’s face right now, they would have been given a shock. Han Sen was half-human and half-spirit. He looked extremely weird. He looked like a demon from hell.

Time went by. The Super God Spirit body’s spirit body returned to the shape of an ordinary human. It looked quite normal.

Han Sen still knew that he was in Super God Spirit mode. He never left that mode.

Compared to before, Han Sen felt freer than ever. When he used his Super God Spirit body, it led to many burdens blistering his body. Now, those feelings were gone. It was like this was always how his body was supposed to be.

When his body finished evolving, Han Sen’s body felt relaxed. He felt as if something was different with his body even though there were no differences.

He looked at his information.

Han Sen: Super god body (none)

Lifespan: 3,246 years

Han Sen was frozen. Humans from the sanctuaries all had Super God bodies, but his Super God body was a Super God Spirit body. Right after he evolved, his Super God body had become nothing.

Han Sen tried using his powers, but he noticed his body was unable to use his Super God body anymore.

“Gosh, this is all just so strange. I mean, how is this possible? Why is my body totally out of whack now? It’s starting to make me think that the further I take my body, and the more I evolve, the further back I go. Have I just gone so far past the limit that I’ve looped to start over again?” Han Sen was confused.

Han Sen tried casting his geno arts, but his face looked terrible. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He felt as if his body had become a real, average body. He was so slow that he could not feel his body moving.

“What is going on?” Han Sen was shocked. He cast a few more geno arts, but it was exactly the same. No matter what geno art he used, his body had no feeling. It felt as if his body was just a stone that did not work.

Han Sen walked back to Space Garden. His body did not move fast. He was like a normal person. He was not faster than any average person.

When he ran, he did not feel tired. He ran all the way back to base without blushing. He was not winded, and he did not gasp. All in all, he did not feel tired.

“Mister White, help me have a look at what happened to my body.” Han Sen sought out Mister White.

Mister White looked at Han Sen and weirdly said, “Judging from the state of your body, I would say you are fine. What is wrong with you?”

“I cannot feel my powers anymore.” Han Sen told Mister White about what had happened.

Mister White had Han Sen lie down. He inspected Han Sen’s body and told him that his body was fine. There was no problem with it.

“If there aren’t any problems, then why can I not feel my powers?” Han Sen was very depressed.

He was like a wizard that did not have an element. He could not use his super powers. It felt terrible.

Mister White thought about it for a moment and told Han Sen, “Let me think about this some more. Let me think about this before I give you an answer. You go to Han Yufei and let her do a complete body check for you.”

Han Sen had no other options, so he did just that. He went to see Han Yufei. Han Yufei listened to Han Sen’s entire tale, including Mister White’s hypothesis. It made her eyes turn bright. She dragged Han Sen to the laboratory.

Han Sen’s heart jumped. He felt bad. He looked at Han Yufei’s face. It looked as if he was now about to go through all sorts of weird torture.

“I do not want a check-up.” Han Sen turned around with the desire of leaving.

“Do not be afraid. I will be nice to you.” Han Yufei put on the white lab gloves. She smiled at Han Sen and dragged him into the lab.

Normally, Han Sen could have easily teleported away without Han Yufei being able to catch him. On this day, he could not feel his powers. He was like an average person. He could not escape. He was immediately dragged into the lab by Han Yufei.
