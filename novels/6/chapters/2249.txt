Chapter 2250 Ghost Bone Arrives

Han Sen looked at the Ghost Bone Mask, and he saw it create a connection with his simulated Ghost Bone power.

“This Ghost Bone Mask is one of the weaker ones, but gaining its allegiance in a single month is excellent progress. We still have time. Practice some more to build confidence with the mask. And...” Fox Queen turned to point at a different mask. “If you can forge a connection with this Ghost Bone Mask instead, killing the xenogeneic should come easy.”

Han Sen looked at the mask Fox Queen was indicating. He used his Dongxuan Aura and the Purple-Eye Butterfly to examine it. It was indeed the strongest Ghost Bone Mask there. Its powers surpassed those of the other masks by a substantial margin.

“What makes this Ghost Bone Mask different from the others?” Han Sen asked, pretending he hadn’t noticed its strength.

Fox Queen said, “They are all half-deified xenogeneic skulls, but some of the creatures were stronger than others. That Ghost Bone Mask is made from the skull of a demon of hell. Ghost Bone spent a lot of time and effort on that one. And I do mean a lot. Its powers were almost deified. It is the strongest Ghost Bone Mask here.”

“Don’t worry, it’s just a xenogeneic King that I need to kill. No matter how strong it is, the power of something half-deified will surely be enough to kill it. I can just use the mask that I’ve already claimed.” Han Sen raised his hand toward the Ghost Bone Mask he had already established a connection with, and the mask flew over to him. He clutched it in his hands.

Before he had Ghost Bone powers, simply touching the mask had sent Han Sen shooting back into a wall. Now that he could hold the mask freely, he could get a real sense of its overwhelming power.

Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura and Purple-Eye Butterfly to get a good look at the mask, then he settled it on his face.

As soon as it touched his face, power surged into Han Sen’s body. The new energy swelled through Han Sen’s Ghost Bone powers, increasing their might dramatically.

Suddenly, Han Sen’s face went pale, and worry clenched his stomach. He wanted to take the mask off, but it was now too late to do so. A powerful will roared out of the mask and swept inside Han Sen. It prevented Han Sen from moving a single inch. The Ghost Bone power was like a tsunami rushing through him. Han Sen’s body turned black, and a ghostly aura surrounded him.

The will of the mask was demonic, and it felt like everything around them would fall under its spell. It suppressed Han Sen’s own will, and it coldly said, “This body isn’t the best, but it’s not too bad. I suppose I can make use of it.”

“You are General Ghost Bone?” Han Sen had realized whose Ghost Bone Mask this was. He wasn’t scared, though. He had known there was something off with the item, and he just hadn’t been able to determine the precise nature of the issue. At least he knew his feelings hadn’t been led astray.

Ghost Bone powers kept pumping into Han Sen’s body. General Ghost Bone’s will leaned on Han Sen’s like a mountain.

General Ghost Bone’s soul was inside Han Sen’s head. “Yes, I am Ghost Bone King. Thanks to your help, I will now be able to manifest through your body. If you have something you want to do before your death, and it isn’t too problematic, I can help you with it.”

Han Sen used his Dongxuan Sutra to stop simulating the Ghost Bone power. The Ghost Bone powers that were surging into his body screeched to a halt.

General Ghost Bone seemed surprised. “You didn’t practice the Ghost Bone Technique! But even so, you can make use of its power? That is quite tricky.”

“My body isn’t a Ghost Bone Body, so why do you want to use it?” Han Sen asked emotionlessly.

“You’re just a Duke, so I can make your body a Ghost Bone Body with minimal effort. And yes, I am going to make use of your body!” General Ghost Bone growled, his voice hard. He stopped trying to suppress Han Sen’s will, but the Ghost Bone power from the Ghost Bone Mask became stronger.

The black Ghost Bone power settled over Han Sen’s every cell, and it made his genes look different.

Han Sen cast Jadeskin, and he turned into a jade statue. The Ghost Bone powers sank into him slowly, but they couldn’t change the shape of his body.

“You’ve practiced an invincible body? That is very rare!” General Ghost Bone seemed even more surprised now. His voice sounded greedy, and the Ghost Bone power from the Ghost Bone Mask became even stronger.

Han Sen’s Jadeskin body was strong, but it couldn’t withstand the power of General Ghost Bone. The power bearing down on him was deified. His Jadeskin body began to transform into bone. He was starting to take on the shape of a black bone statue.

Han Sen couldn’t fight off General Ghost Bone’s power, but at the same time, General Ghost Bone couldn’t overcome and defeat his will.

“General Ghost Bone, do you know anything about a town located in a desert called Ghost Bone Town?” Han Sen asked suddenly.

“You have been there?” General Ghost Bone said. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“The place is called Ghost Bone Town, so why is a statue of you standing guard before a gate? And who does the statue inside the palace belong to? Is that the leader of Sacred?” Han Sen asked.

“You’re about to die, and this is what you’re spending your energy on?” General Ghost Bone asked in wonder.

“Well, if I am dying, I don’t want to leave this mortal plane with unanswered questions,” Han Sen said.

“I will tell you; it is where the leader was resting,” General Ghost Bone explained as he continued changing Han Sen’s body.

“It’s a mausoleum of some sort? Whose statue is in the palace? How did he end up there?” Han Sen asked.

General Ghost Bone seemed to sneer coldly. “Maybe he deserved it?”

General Ghost Bone seemed to harbor disdain for the Human King, but he didn’t say anything about who he actually was.

“Then who is he? And why is his statue there in the palace?” Han Sen kept asking.

“You are a dead man. You don’t need to know so much!” General Ghost Bone didn’t want to talk. All he wanted to do was morph Han Sen’s body.

Han Sen’s body turned from black to white. He became a being of white bone, which looked very strange.

The black bone power was very evil, but now, it turned to white bone. And it didn’t seem so evil anymore. There was some sunny air inside him.

“I found a special stone plate inside the palace; do you know what that is?” Han Sen asked. Han Sen had many questions, and it seemed as if only General Ghost Bone could give him the answer he sought.

General Ghost Bone paused. Even the Ghost Bone powers that were changing Han Sen came to a halt. The question had obviously stunned General Ghost Bone.

“You found the relic? Why do you have it?” General Ghost Bone quickly asked.

“I have it with me right now. What is the relic? What does it do?” Han Sen asked.

“Haha! God is helping me right now, for sure. With this relic, I can access the item located inside that holy monument. My Ghost Bone era is on its way.” General Ghost Bone laughed like a madman inside Han Sen’s brain.
