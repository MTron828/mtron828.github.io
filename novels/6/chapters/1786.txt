1787 One Sword to Fight Alone

“All teams need to reach the battlefield in five minutes! No, three minutes!” Angry Steel Viscount shouted down the communicator. His face had turned green.

He didn’t think Greatsword Viscount would be killed quite so easily. That Baron was pretty scary, and Angry Steel felt so angry, knowing his men were proving to be so useless against the attacker.

Usually, this would be fine. But now Mister Ji was watching as the Angry Steel Army got massacred by a mere Baron and watching as that same Baron destroyed a strike team. It made Angry Steel want to dig a hole to hide in.

Mister Ji watched the video feed of Han Sen for a little while longer, then he turned around and left.

“Mister Ji, please give me another chance! Angry Steel Army will kill that Baron,” Angry Steel said hastily.

“Keep him busy.” Mister Ji walked out of the camp. He was looking in the direction of the battlefield.

The maid followed behind Mister Ji, and as she walked, she said, “Sir, he is just a Baron. You don’t need to challenge the man yourself. If you want to see him alive, just tell Angry Steel Viscount to go and grab him.”

Mister Ji laughed and did not say anything. He kept his eyes to the battlefield as he walked.

After he was gone, Angry Steel was incredibly furious. He was shouting into the communicator, saying, “I give you five minutes! Kill that Baron before Mister Ji gets there. Otherwise, you will all suffer military punishment.”

After shouting, Angry Steel exited the camp and chased after Mister Ji.

Angry Steel Army’s nine captains did not dare to move slowly. They all led their teams to the battlefield.

Taurus were supposedly good at fighting and killing. Their vitality was above average, and their fighting skills were really good. They were in a rush to get there now, but the formation of the teams was not a mess. With nine captains, they were all going to strike at once.

Han Sen had already killed one strike team, and it didn’t even seem to have slowed him down.

Because there were too many of the centaurs, all racing to kill the innocents so quickly, he couldn’t chase them away. He had no choice but to kill them.

Amidst the killing, however, Han Sen discovered something interesting.

His Dongxuan Armor could absorb power.

Han Sen already knew that it gave him energy to fight non-stop, but now he was feeling something more in the energy flowing out of the armor. If the armor usually had one water tap providing energy, then he could now feel many more open faucets. Han Sen’s life was stronger, and his power had increased.

This increase happened after he dealt with the strike team.

“Does this mean the Dongxuan Armor absorbs the power of the earth? Just like my Coin geno core could when I used Collecting Taxes. The more creatures there are around me, the more power I receive?” Han Sen thought to himself.

Han Sen soon received an answer to this. When the nine teams arrived, Han Sen felt his Dongxuan Armor give a vastly greater surge of energy. This went beyond merely recovering the energy that he had lost.

“So it’s true!” Han Sen was quite happy about this discovery, but he didn’t know if it was a result of his Dongxuan Sutra or his Dollar geno core.

This was not something Han Sen could ponder now, however. He had no time, due to nine Taurus Viscounts headed his way. They all looked pretty passed.

Han Sen was merely a Baron, and even with the Dongxuan Armor’s buff, he’d still wouldn’t be quite as strong as a Viscount. If he missed a single strike, things would turn out very poorly for him.

Lao Zhuoma had watched Han Sen kill Greatsword Viscount. He had been stunned when that happened, but now, there was a whole army of centaurs coming. Han Sen was like a small rowboat amidst of sea of tumultuous waves. It didn’t seem like things would end well for him.

“Get on the ship, quick!” Lao Zhuoma shouted distractedly at the Kate still trying to board the ship Mike had seen Han Sen fighting from the upper deck, and he watched with a complicated expression.

Buzz!

Before the centaur army reached Han Sen, they all lifted their spears and threw them at him like javelins. There were so many of them, they looked like a cloud in the sky.

Han Sen looked up at the spears that were falling like rain. As he did, the Gold Feather Bow disappeared. His right hand touched his waist, and when he did, something white appeared.

A white swordlight blazed out from his hand. Under the black rain of spears, it looked like a sun that was swelling to life.

Han Sen ran into the ring of spears he had cut down, and wherever he went, countless spears were broken. None of the spears could cut through his net of swordstrikes.

“Amazing sword skills!” Everyone who witnessed it was flabbergasted, whether they were friend or foe.

But the Taurus were not going to retreat, and the nine captains were still leading their teams towards Han Sen. They surrounded him by keeping their formations tightly knit.

“The sword air travels thirty thousand miles, and one sword can puncture nine layers of the sky. I thought that any man who can do such marvelous things must be a swordmaster. But he is just a Baron. I was certain that he possessed a higher rank... Talk about shocking.” From a broken building not far away, Mister Ji was watching the swordlight performance with admiration.

“Very good. I have followed you and have born witness to many higher races, but none have used such excellent sword techniques as this Baron here.” Even the maid gave Han Sen a compliment

Angry Steel continued to look terrible. All ten of his teams had arrived, and all they had to do was kill one Baron. But they were being destroyed. The sword air cut through his army like a sickle through field grass.

What made him angriest, though, was that the man didn’t have as much power as any of the captains. And yet, despite that, the Baron was invincible. Angry Steel’s soldiers had been unable to do anything to him.

It was fortunate the person was only a Baron, so he couldn’t use more swordlights. He could only kill one warrior at a time. If this hadn’t been the case, thousands would have died in mere moments.
