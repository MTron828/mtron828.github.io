2073 Absolute Container

“Where are the items you sucked into it? Can I see them?” Han Sen asked Bao’er happily.

They were digested a long time ago,” Bao’er said, blinking again.

Han Sen was speechless, and so he asked, “You just said you could release them.”

Bao’er seemed a little indignant. “I can, but I have to know that they need to be saved. Otherwise, they will be digested by the gourd.”

“Bao’er’s little gourd might be able to catch that red cloud. But Bao’er has been in the sanctuary all this time, and I have yet to see her evolve. She can’t be any greater than a Baron. There is no way she can absorb that Marquise red cloud,” Han Sen thought.

Bao’er seemed to understand what Han Sen was thinking. She clapped her hands and the shiny gourd appeared between them. She said to Han Sen, “Dad, what would you like to claim? My gourd is powerful, and it can absorb anything.”

“I will tell you another time.” Han Sen touched Bao’er on the head, then teleported back to his Jade Island in Sky Palace. Han Sen wanted to find a chance to bring Bao’er there, so he could try out her gourd powers.

Bao’er had eaten many of the xenogeneic genes Han Sen had given her, but she still wasn’t getting pushed out by the sanctuary. Because of that, she couldn’t be too strong.

Han Sen cooked a xenogeneic material in a pot. The xenogeneic gene was almost too big to fit in the pot, but he choked it all down anyway and heard the announcement.

“Marquise Gene +1”

The pot of meat must have weighed at least one hundred kilograms. Although Han Sen had the ability of Consume, it still made him uncomfortable to eat all that at once. He gave up on eating for the evening.

“It looks like it’s better to stick to smaller xenogeneic genes.” As Han Sen was speaking to himself, someone outside the island called his name.

Han Sen stepped out. He saw White Real high above, riding a bird made of wood. When Han Sen stepped outside, White Real brought it down to land on the island.

“Brother Han, come with me quick!” White Real jumped off the bird and grabbed Han Sen, pulling him to the creature. “Brother White, what’s going on?” Han Sen asked, with obvious confusion.

As they mounted, White Real said, “Our leader is inviting you to Sky Path Garden. He wants you to help us refine the Blood Feather Knife.”

“He’s asking me to help? I’m no good with that sort of thing. What am I supposed to do?” Han Sen was shocked. Surely the things he had learned couldn’t compare to the combined minds that already worked in Sky Path Garden.

If Bai Yishan was there, perhaps he could make worthwhile contributions to their research. Han Sen knew some things, but not to that level.

Plus, there was a big difference between the geno arts of the sanctuary and the geno arts of the geno universe. They couldn’t really be talked about as if they were the same thing.

The geno arts Han Sen had in the sanctuaries were edited, and they were different from their geno universe equivalents. He also had to refine xenogeneic treasures to make them work.

“Brother Han, don’t be so humble! You were able to remove the xenogeneic blood from the knife. You are good at this. Let’s go. The leader and the others are waiting for you.” White Real pushed Han Sen atop the wooden bird, and then they took off towards Sky Path Garden.

When they arrived, Han Sen explained to them that he had only been able to remove the xenogeneic blood because his geno art was compatible with it. Han Sen did not know how to refine a xenogeneic treasure or craft a deified treasure.

The head researcher smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Han Sen. We have invited you here so you can be a part of the refinement process. If we find some leftover blood while we are refining it’ we will require your assistance. Otherwise, our work will be wasted.”

Han Sen told them there was not a single drop of blood left, but the elders that worked with the leader were worried that there might still have been some. So, they asked him to stay.

Fortunately, Sky Path Garden did not ask anything more of him. Han Sen just sat in the refinement room, listening to the commands issued by the head researcher.

Han Sen had nothing to do, so he practiced with his Jadeskin. He also watched the refinement process for the Blood Feather Knife. He learned a lot.

The Blood Feather Knife was placed inside a crystal container. Han Sen thought they’d use blacksmithing techniques and fire to change the blade.

He was wrong. There wasn’t even the slightest spark.

The white feather knife was placed in a container. They cleansed the container, put the knife inside, and removed all the air within it. Then they lowered the temperature as far as they could.

As the temperature dropped, the Blood Feather Knife looked like it was being crystallized. In the end, the entire knife appeared to be entirely crystal, just like the container itself. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

One of Sky Path Garden’s teachers used an instrument to check the Blood Feather Knife and frowned. “The temperature is not low enough. We cannot activate the power of the Blood Feather Knife.”

Han Sen, after four days of being there, had heard the same thing a thousand times. They tried to lower the knife’s temperature, but they could never hit the depths they required.

Han Sen didn’t know why they wanted to lower the temperature, but he saw a lot of secret cold element geno arts.

They were really scary. Other materials would crumble easily at such temperatures, but the knife seemed just fine.

That crystal container is impressive. It can endure such incredible cold without breaking,” Han Sen said quietly to himself.

White Real’s ears were sharp, though. He heard Han Sen’s statement and said proudly, “Brother Han, you are right! The container is good. This is the only deified item that belongs to Sky Path Garden.”

“That thing is deified?” Han Sen was shocked to hear this. He knew it was very durable, but he never expected it to be deified.

“Its name is Absolute Container, and it has a whole lot of uses. Many of our high-tier treasures are refined inside it. Half of the King class weapons in Sky Palace were made in there,” White Real said seriously.

Han Sen started to ask something else, but the head researcher spoke glumly. “It looks like our power isn’t enough to reduce the item’s temperature to what the knife needs. Old Dong, please go to White Jade City and invite him to join us.”

“Will he come?” Old Dong looked depressed.
