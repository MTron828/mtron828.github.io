Chapter 1747 Black River Xenogeneic

“You. You. You. And you. Come with me.” The two Feathers approached Han Sen and a few others. They didn’t descend. The male Feather just pointed at a few people from above.

Hardman, Guris, Mister Tiger, and Han Sen had been selected. Hardman’s face changed. He smiled and said, “What can we do to help you both? Black Gold Group will do its best to assist you.”

“Cut the crap! Just come,” the male Feather said coldly. He looked annoyed.

“Sir, do we need more people?” Hardman did not dare fight back, so he smiled and spoke.

Pang!

The male Feather swung his gold lance and sliced an armored truck in half, as if it was nothing more than tofu. He said quietly, “I don’t like repeating myself.”

Hardman’s face turned a little green. He held his tongue and instead just said something to Lena, before walking forward with Guris and Mister Tiger.

Han Sen said to Qiao, “You go on home. I’ll be back.”

After that, he followed after Mister Tiger. Seeing the simple display of the Feather’s power, he knew he’d have to go with them. But Han Sen wasn’t too worried about the situation. He had the power to travel back to the sanctuary. If things got hairy, he could zap back instantly.

Of course, he didn’t want to risk making an enemy out of the Feathers, either. They were really powerful, and Han Sen was way too weak to fight them in their prime.

Han Sen didn’t want to hide in the sanctuary, either. Littleflower was gone, and Han Sen knew that if he wanted to get his son back, he’d have to make himself stronger.

The Feathers ignored their followers as they flew on ahead. Han Sen and the other three followed.

“We should have brought a car.” The four of them were sweating profusely, and the Feathers had no intention of slowing down or taking a break to wait for them. It was Mister Tiger complaining.

It was worse for Hardman, though. He wasn’t a Noble, and he wasn’t the sort to participate in battles. Out of the four of them, he had the worst body. His lips were turning white, but he didn’t dare to stop. He kept on running in pursuit.

They ran a dozen miles until they reached a black river. There, the Feathers stopped and landed on a rock on the riverbank.

Gentlemen, we will try to help by giving this everything we’ve got!” Hardman was gasping, but he still managed to smile.

“You four jump in the river here and swim downstream,” the Feather said coldly. He sure looked arrogant.

After saying that, the faces of the four changed. Now they could guess why the Feathers had brought them here.

It was because the xenogeneic was hiding in the river, refusing to reveal itself. Feathers were bad when it came to water fights, too. They were going to use the weaker races as bait to draw the monster out.

The four of them were internally cursing the two Feathers, but they didn’t show it. Hardman quickly said, “Respectfully, if you wish to draw out the xenogeneic, we have many lesser soldiers for the task. If we call on more, we can definitely draw it out.”

“Get in the water.” The male Feather looked at Hardman expressionlessly and raised his golden lance. The lance was pointing right at Hardman.

If Hardman said one more word, he was definitely going to be killed. He’d be bait dead or alive.

Hardman gritted his teeth. He looked at Guris and Mister Tiger, then inched his way towards the river.

Guris and Mister Tiger smiled wryly, and then they too followed. In their hearts, they hated the Feathers a great deal.

“I said get in the water. Didn’t you hear me?” The male Feather saw that Han Sen wasn’t moving, and he looked at him coldly.

“Let him go. He is just a kid,” the female Feather said.

The male Feather heard her, but he still raised his lance and looked at Han Sen, saying, “Do not make me repeat myself again.”

Han Sen did not move, and he simply looked at the male Feather that was perched upon the rock.

Han Sen could survive an attack from the Feather, but if he went down the river, he wouldn’t know when the xenogeneic would reveal itself, and neither would he learn its level. He had no idea what to expect.

If the xenogeneic attacked underwater and caught Han Sen at unawares, he couldn’t use his space-travel technique. And then, staying alive would be impossible. So, he didn’t want to risk that.

The male Feather looked murderous. He was waving his gold lance around. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Han Sen’s hand clutched the Rhino Horn Dagger. He would rather fight the Feather than put his life in danger the other way. As the male Feather lifted his lance, a splash came from the river, followed by a scream.

The two Feathers and Han Sen looked over, and they saw that something was moving at the center of the river. It was heading towards Hardman and the other two. The other two had been gripped by tentacles and were being dragged forward.

Only Mister Tiger’s geno weapon could deal damage to the tentacle. He couldn’t cut through it, but he had managed to wound the tentacle and send it reeling back. So far, Mister Tiger was still free.

Hardman and Guris screamed as they were dragged further down the river. They could not fight back, and their geno armors were too weak to resist the tentacles.

Boom!

A bolt of golden lightning zapped through the sky. It broke the atmosphere before piercing through the tentacles.

The Feather flew over to the beast and hit the river with his lance. The water of the river pulled away from the lance, creating a dozen-meter-deep trench.

An octopus-looking monster was revealed. Half of its body was in the water, and its ten-meter-long tentacles were tangling up Hardman and Guris.

The Feather’s lance was now striking the creature’s head. The monster tried swinging at the lance and Feather, but a gold arrow flew through the air and pinned down the tentacle. Because of the archer’s assist, the male Feather was still free to act.

Dong!

A blue-looking crystal tentacle appeared. It blocked the Feather’s gold lance, and the power made the Feather fall back a few meters in the air.
