Chapter 3137 Thirty Percent Benefit

“Mister Wei, please explain to me the details you have about Bee Planet,” Sky King said to Mister Wei.

Mister Wei remained silent. He did not speak. Sky King understood what Mister Wei was worried about. He said, “Mister, please explain it to me. The people in this carriage are all my friends. There are no outsiders in here.”

After hearing Sky King say that, Mister Wei was surprised. One would have expected Sky King and Han Sen to be rivals due to their associations with different factions.

Now, all the nobles were supposed to hate Han Sen. Sky King was the biggest noble in the Qin Kingdom, and he was saying that Han Sen was not an outsider. Mister Wei thought it was ridiculous.

Mister Wei did not know why Sky King had to be like this. Others did not know about the power the fish in Bao’er’s hand possessed. Sky King knew it very well.

Regarding the personalities of the father and daughter, he knew about them all too well.

To prevent Han Sen from coming to mess things up while digging land pulses, they might as well have given him a cut to stop him from starting anything. Of course, Sky King was hoping to use Han Sen and the little fish’s power. With the help the flying fish could provide, even they were all in danger, there was something crucial that could always turn the tides in their favor.

Mister Wei remained silent for a moment and then finally said, “This planet is one of the seven planets of Ghost Starlight. This planet is now filled with scary toxic bee gene races. There is only one possibility for why that happened. When the god pulse was formed, this planet already had a powerful bee gene race that was at least god class.”

“Mister Wei, the planet’s beehive is so scary. Did the bee king swallow the god pulse on this planet?” Sky King was scared of everything.

Mister Wei shook his head. “My King, you think too much. Although the beehive on this planet is huge, there is only one toxic bee. The entire bee legion you see was summoned by him. The power of that toxic bee is probably summoning those bees.”

After pausing, Mister Wei said, “I have been watching them for a while. Although the toxic bee legion is scary, there isn’t the presence of a God Spirit. I cannot tell what the toxic bee’s level is, but it did not consume the God Spirit Blood-Pulse. From what I have been able to determine, this planet does not have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse.”

“That is very good,” Sky King said with a nod. “If things are this way, then there is no use in delaying things further. Let’s go to the planet and slay the toxic bee gene race. I do not want it to ruin the gene eggs in the land pulse.”

“I totally agree with that.” Mister Wei agreed with Sky King’s decision.

Sky King did not make any orders yet. He looked at Han Sen and said, “Brother Han, as for the benefits we claim from the planet, you and Mister Wei can have 30% each. Since we will use my power and resources, I will get 40%.”

“Sure. We’ll do as you tell us,” Han Sen said.

Mister Wei and Bald Guy felt weird. Mister Wei was in charge of seeking out land pulses. He provided a lot of support, but he was only going to get 30%. Han Sen did not use power or resources, and he was still going to get 30%. That was hard for them to believe.

They did not know that Sky King only wanted Han Sen and Bao’er, the father and daughter duo, to not mess things up for them. He did not actually expect them to do anything.

Li Bing Yu thought, “Why does Sky King treat Han Sen like this? How did the two even meet? If they used to know each other, Han Sen’s identity wouldn’t be so simple.”

“That must be right. Han Sen must be the hidden heir of some family in the Qin Kingdom. Otherwise, why would Sky King give his self-identifying Sky Order to Han Sen’s daughter? It wouldn’t make any real sense otherwise. Why else would he treat Han Sen so nice?” Li Bing Yu thought that had to be right.

The big dragon space riders headed down into the planet. The toxic bee crowds were scary but having big dragon riders ahead of them made them not as scary. The big dragons spewed fire to burn down the cloud-like assembly of toxic bees. With haste, they sped into the planet, but there were too many toxic bees. It was hard to clear them. The big dragon space riders could only clear the toxic bee legions around them.

Just as Mister Wei said, the crowds of toxic bees were not real. Once they were killed, the bodies disappeared. The vast amounts killed did not litter the planet. They were not genuine gene races.

Sky King looked at Mister Wei and asked, “Mister, is there a way to find out where the real toxic bee is hiding?”

“It is not hard,” Mister Wei said with a nod. He summoned a gene race. The gene race looked like a turtle, but its head was shaped like a snake. Many mysterious symbols were present on the turtle’s back. There was a needle inside the creature too. It looked very weird.

Mister Wei bit into his finger and dropped a spot of blood onto the needle in the turtle’s back. Once it came into contact with Mister Wei’s blood, the needle started to spin.

When the needle stopped in a direction, Mister Wei quickly said, “The toxic bee’s real body is that way.”

Sky King immediately commanded his riders to go that way, but the needle on the turtle’s back kept changing its orientation. They were quickly able to find out where the toxic bee was actually hiding.

When the toxic bee changed direction, the needle on the turtle’s changed direction to follow it.

After finding out where the toxic bee was, Sky King did not need to do anything. His elites were already able to slay the king-class toxic bee. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Han Sen thought this was rather interesting. No matter if it was a scary summon power toxic bee or Mister Wei’s compass turtle, they all had magical powers.

That was especially true of Mister Wei’s compass turtle. It was just a duke-class mutant gene race, but without it, it would have been difficult to find the god-class toxic bee.

“The gene race powers really do change a lot. The level of something is not the problem. It all depends on the caster. If a gene race is used well, that is how victory can be determined.” Han Sen noticed a gene race’s utility was not defined by its level.

Of course, higher-level gene races did provide greater benefits. Compared to a gene race with a similar element, one at a higher level was still better.

The toxic bee king was killed. The entire planet’s toxic bee legion vanished. The big dragon’s space riders controlled the entire planet.

Mister Wei and his students searched the land pulse. They found the land pulse and had the big dragon riders do the digging. Han Sen and the others did not even have to lift a finger. He was just there, chilling with Sky King and idly chatting

“What makes Han Sen and the others worthy of having a 30% cut? They did not do anything.” Brother Three knew about that, and it made him angry. The big brother quietly said, “Brother Three, stop talking crap. If Sky King gave him 30%, that means Han Sen was worth it. You should stop trying to provoke him.”

Brother Three was not happy, but he knew he was right. His face turned green, but he no longer dared to say anything.

Including Mister Wei, everyone was busy. Only Sky King, Han Sen, and a few others were free. They gathered before a table, watching and talking. “Brother Han, are you and Bao’er interested in the god fights?”.

“It depends. I will join if I have the time,” Han Sen casually said. He sounded really chill about it, but he did not actually know what the god fights were. Thus, he did not answer clearly.
