Chapter 1912 This Is Unique

On a planet of Narrow Moon, a Rebate mother was praying sincerely.

“God of the Rebate, please allow my child to evolve a second time, despite having already generated armor. I will give everything I have for this.” The mother’s face looked so sad.

She was Jade Duke’s wife. She had a son with Jade Duke. Both of their genes were exceptional, and their child should have absolutely become a Noble. But when her son generated a geno armor a few days ago, he did not evolve a second time. He became a commoner.

Even for a Duke, it was difficult to gather items to allow a second chance to evolve. Jade Duke didn’t have what was required. So, the son’s mother prayed to God, hoping for a miracle. They wanted him to evolve a second time, so they would not be laughed at.

Your sincerity has touched God. I can satisfy your wishes.” A god with gold-clothing appeared before the lady. It smiled strangely at her.

The news of Planet Eclipse possessing a red mist spring had spread, and the reports sounded true.

But without Knife Queen’s permission, no one was allowed to go to Planet Eclipse to find that spring. Despite that, the Narrow Moon factions kept pushing. Moon Wheel King gathered a few Kings together for a meeting in Full Moon. Knife Queen was present there, too.

“Knife, does Planet Eclipse have a red mist spring?” Night River King asked. He had a child that had not evolved a second time, as well.

“Yes,” Knife Queen said.

“Why did you not tell us sooner? We cannot allow Han Sen to lay claim to that treasure.” Night River King looked very angry.

It wasn’t just Night River King feeling this way, either. The other Kings were all peeved, too. Their children, and the people who followed them, needed the spring, too. The Kings were here to represent all those who needed it.

Yisha coldly looked at Night River King and said, “Han Sen is my student. And don’t forget that you were the one to give him Planet Eclipse, as a slight. Do you think you can just break the Narrow Moon laws to suit yourself?”

Night River King coughed and kept going. “We cannot break our laws, no. But Han Sen is still a suspicious individual. If we provide him this treasure and then discover he is a spy, we will suffer a grand loss. Don’t you all agree?”

Yes. We shouldn’t allow an outsider to receive such a treasure,” Flower King said.

Aside from Black-Moon King, all the other Kings shared the same opinion.

“Knife, we don’t know how much is stored in that spring. If it isn’t much, then it is fine. If it is a lot, we cannot allow a suspicious outsider to lay claim to it. Why don’t we send someone to inspect how much is stored there? Then, we can fairly share the contents of the spring. We can save some for Han Sen. Does that suggestion not satisfy all our desires?” Moon Wheel King said.

This time, many of the other Kings agreed. They weren’t greedy about the spring. The pressure was merely coming from their family members and other bad relationships.

“Han Sen is my student, and Planet Eclipse is bound to him legally.” Yisha spoke with an absence of emotion.

“Knife, why are you being so stubborn? He is just an outsider. And he is suspicious.” Night River King looked glum. He went on to say, “If you absolutely insist on this stance, then we’ll take it to a vote. You know what will happen after that.”

Yisha looked at all of them and said, “Fine. You want the red mist spring so badly? You can bring ten members. No one above Viscount is allowed. How much they can claim will depend entirely on them. That is my bottom line on this matter.”

“Okay, deal,” Night River King agreed, and the other Kings did not have an opinion. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

After Night River King returned to his planet, he rounded up the ten best Viscounts he could. He ordered them to collect as much of the red mist spring as they could.

“Sword Know, you can stay; I wish to talk with you,” Night River King said to a Viscount with a bird head and a human body.

Yes, My King?” Sword Know’s beady hawk eyes looked right at him when he spoke.

Night River King gave Sword Know a box and said, ‘You only need half a step to become Earl. This is a spirit orb that I have saved. With this orb, you should be able to become an Earl. Take it to Planet Eclipse and make yourself an Earl there. And of course, try to grab as much of the spring water as you can.”

“Yes, My King. I will not disappoint you.” Sword Know accepted the spirit orb and looked pleased. He thanked Night River King.

With his skill, he only needed a spirit orb to become an Earl. There was no chance of him failing this. This saved him years of practicing.

All the factions sent their Viscounts to Planet Eclipse. A big battleship was headed straight for Mirror Lake.

“Narrow Moon is still not my Narrow Moon.” Inside the palace, Yisha watched the monitor with a gloomy look. She looked totally cold.

Han Sen was her student, and these people were going to steal and split up his spring. It made her incredibly angry.

She had done everything she could to prevent this, but if she had stubbornly forced them to take a vote, the end result would have been far worse. No one would take her corner.

“Deified... I need to be deified to be the absolute queen of the Rebate!” Yisha closed her eyes. The power inside her rumbled like thunder; it could have swallowed the skies.

Even as strong as Yisha was, she couldn’t do anything right now. She wanted more power.

Inside the cave in the the Red Mist Valley, the red mist was sucked into a vortex. Then, it disappeared. It went into the plants.

The three little minks were like treasures. Their bodies were glowing so much, it was difficult to look at them directly.

The centipede was moving quickly towards the plants. It extended its head, cracked open its mouth, and tried to swallow one of the minks.

The glowing mink tried to run away in terror, but its tail was attached to the plant and it could not run.
