2076 Back to Narrow Moon

Han Sen submitted an application at the general services building, requesting that his daughter be allowed to join him in Sky Palace. He received permission, and so he left Sky Palace and returned to Planet Eclipse to pick her up.

Han Sen was careful not to attract attention on the trip, and his return voyage was not impeded by troubles. He brought Bao’er into the geno universe half-way, and then went to Narrow Moon.

He took Bao’er to meet Yisha, who quickly grew fond of her. She allowed Bao’er to stay on Planet Blade, while Han Sen went back to Planet Eclipse.

Han Sen knew that Yisha intended to investigate Bao’er. The Rebate did not have strictly enforced rules like Sky Palace, but they wouldn’t allow someone unknown to occupy a high level district.

It wasn’t as if she was an ordinary immigrant, either. Relatives of an important person required some testing to see how far along they themselves might have progressed.

Han Sen wasn’t worried, though. Bao’er was incredibly smart, and he was sure she’d have no problems.

Back on Planet Eclipse, Xie Qing King, Gu Qingcheng, and the others had all become Earls. Zero, Dragon Lady, Han Meng’er, Little Angel, and Wang Yuhang were Earls, too.

Han Sen’s friends had geno arts that were easier to level up than The Story of Genes, and they did not have to practice four different geno arts at the same time, either. In combination with the many resources of Planet Eclipse, this allowed them to level up quickly.

“Old Han! We are already Earls, and the resources on Planet Eclipse can’t support us beyond Marquise. We would like to explore and practice off-world.” Xie Qing King told Han Sen.

Gu Qingcheng, Wang Yuhang, and Dragon Lady wished to do the same. Han Sen agreed to let them practice someplace else, but he also tasked them with recruiting. That way, Han Sen could bring more people from the Alliance, when they returned.

Perhaps it was because of the gold bird markings, but the refugees that populated Han Sen’s base were now Baron nobles. He had enough people there, as well.

“Han Sen, I have heard about you killing Sharon and Dragon Thirteen, beating Dragon Nine in Return Ruin Sea... Your name is all over the geno universe! Everyone knows Knife Queen has a genius student named Han Sen now.” Black Steel came to Planet Eclipse, looking troubled. He went on to say, “But until I become a Duke, Father won’t allow me to leave Narrow Moon. I really want to go and explore with you.”

“If you want to practice, Narrow Moon is the same as anywhere else you could go. There’s little difference. Compared to what I’ve been doing, I’d rather remain in Narrow Moon. I would stay here if I had a choice.” Han Sen laughed.

“Don’t say that. I’m not leaving, anyway,” Black Steel sighed. “By the way, Rebecca is throwing a welcome party. I am here to invite you to come.”

“I don’t have a very good relationship with the people of Moon Garden. Why would they think of inviting me?” Han Sen was surprised.

Black Steel rolled his eyes. “Things are different now. You have earned a brilliant reputation out there, so now you’re Narrow Moon’s golden boy. No one wants a rivalry with you now. Given the absence of any grudges you might have been worried about, perhaps you should go and pay them a visit?”

“Sure. I’ll take your advice.” Han Sen smiled.

He went to Planet Moon Wheel with Black Steel. Rebecca, Du Lishe, and the heirs of other Kings were all gathered there.

This gathering was quite different from the knife events that Han Sen had attended before. Back then, no one cared for him. Everyone looked down on him, and they didn’t bother speaking to him. But now things were different. Han Sen was like a visiting celebrity. The heirs of every King were very polite to him, constantly complimenting him. He talked to more people on that one night than in all the time he had lived in Narrow Moon before.

Han Sen had placed first in the Sky Palace exam and fought Lone Bamboo. He killed Sharon and Dragon Thirteen, and he also beat Dragon Nine. All those feats made Han Sen the first of a new generation of elites in the geno universe.

Although Han Sen had a low chance of ever becoming a King, it wasn’t an impossible task. No one wanted to make him an enemy, either.

“Ha! It’s only his fifteen seconds of fame. All of this is nothing to boast about. It’s all for naught if he can’t become a King, anyway.” Sad Night, who was supposed to be the focus of the night’s proceedings, was sitting in a corner and whining into his drink.

Night River King had the biggest grudge with Han Sen. Sad Night harbored one, too. He didn’t like Han Sen becoming so famous. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“These guys are really short-sighted. They only see Han Sen’s fame now. They aren’t paying any attention to the difficulty Han Sen has leveling up his geno arts. There is no way he’ll become a King. It’s really funny how they’re licking his boots now.” Sad Night heard a voice. He turned around and saw a young Earl Rebate walking towards him with a drink.

Sad Night frowned. He did not recognize the young man. Perhaps it was someone of little renown. The young Earl raised a cup to Sad Night and said, “Mister Night, my name is Vikdo. Can I speak to you alone after the event?”

“What for?” Sad Night looked at him with disdain.

“I have a way in which you could beat Han Sen and take his fame for yourself. Are you interested?” Vikdo said.

You can do that?” Sad Night raised an eyebrow, but he didn’t seem too interested in the young man’s claim.

“I’m not an important person. There is no reason for you to be impressed by me. But you recognize this, don’t you?” Vikdo pulled out his phone and showed Sad Night a video.

When Sad Night saw it, he looked stunned. He balked, “Where did you take this?”

“If you are interested, then let’s resume speaking after the event concludes.” Vikdo smiled.

After the event was over, Rebecca and Du Lishe escorted Han Sen out. They brought him right to the boarding ramp of his aircraft.

“Brother Han, if we have done something to upset you, it’s because we acted foolishly. Please don’t hold it against us,” Rebecca said, then presented Han Sen with a box. “This is a gift we’d like you to accept. It is an apology, and a hope that you’ll forgive us, for the way we mistreated you in the past.”

“It’s okay. Even friends argue sometimes. And I was new to Narrow Moon. I didn’t know you guys,” Han Sen said with a shrug.

“Even so, please take this. How about we be friends?” Rebecca smiled, placing the wooden box in front of him.

“You guys are so nice. Thank you!” Han Sen took the wooden box and smiled at them both.
