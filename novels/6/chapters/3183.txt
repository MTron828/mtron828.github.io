Chapter 3184: I Want to Kill People

In the space battleground, Yan Dan kept firing his arrows. He was like a crazy storm, flinging arrows at Han Sen without reprieve. He thought he could expose flaws in Han Sen’s heart by telling him what had happened in his absence.

The arrows did not harm Han Sen. His body was still able to keep that fight-to-survive mode going. Not a single arrow was able to bring harm to his body.

Han Sen still tried his best to break the Flying Yan Spears’ defense. He had a feeling that once he succeeded, he would be given something quite surprising.

Yan Dan coldly grunted. The southbound leaving bird gene race exploded. The arrows were given fire. They were no longer only operating in empty power mode.

A sky full of arrows came raining down on Han Sen. They were not transparent anymore. They came with very powerful fire arrow power. The moment they touched down on Han Sen’s body, the arrows exploded like a sun.

Many suns were exploding near Han Sen. Scary powers seemed to be able to melt space.

After the group of suns was extinguished, Han Sen’s body broke out from space. It was still complete. It was not damaged.

Yan Dan frowned. Out of the three rare gene races with an ultimate body, the southbound leaving bird had the greatest amount of power. Yet, not even the power of the southbound leaving bird could damage Han Sen’s almighty body. By comparison, the other gene races were beyond useless.

Suddenly, Yan Dan’s eyes turned bright. It was like he had just felt something from amid all that was going on.

He had combined with Rocky Dee’s small amount of God Spirit juice. Although it was still Yan Dan, and he was not really controlled by Rocky Dee’s soul, he somehow had a weird connection to Rocky Dee.

“Your daughter is in Rocky Dee’s hands. If you want her to be safe, exit the fight now.” Yan Dan used a secretive voice to speak to Han Sen. He did not want people to know he had used this dirty method to win the fight.

“Really?” Han Sen finally said something, but he quickly stopped speaking.

The Flying Yan Spears in his hands came to a stop. They were like dead objects fixed in Han Sen’s grasp.

If people were to look closer, they would have seen red markings upon those spooky black spears. They were like bloody, enlarged veins that had started to creep all across the Flying Yan Spears.

The blood-pulse Break World Powers completely took control of the Flying Yan Spears. They were now under Han Sen’s control.

Han Sen was feeling rather sublime. The structure of the Flying Yan Spears was now inside his head. He felt the heartbeats and souls that resided inside the Flying Yan Spears.

It was a feeling that could not be described. It was like the Flying Yan Spears were his own creation. He was the god that made the Flying Yan Spears.

But it did not feel like it. Even a god might not be able to understand someone’s heart completely, but Han Sen’s feeling made him think he fully understood the Flying Yan Spears.

Yan Dan’s voice sounded again. “Han Sen, did you hear what I said? You need to lose to me or else your daughter will die.”

Han Sen’s eyes looked cold. He looked at Yan Dan with a razor-like glare that was sharper than any blade.

Han Sen did not enjoy killing people. He did even enjoy killing his greatest enemies. It was because he was able to understand. From the viewpoint of an opponent, it was normal to want to kill them. He treated people the way they treated him. There was no reason to add unnecessary emotions into the mix.

Yan Dan’s words made Han Sen fill up with a lust for murder.

The look Yan Dan received from Han Sen gave him the creeps. In shock, he suddenly started to step back. He quickly looked normal again.

Bao’er was in Rocky Dee’s hands. He was now in the space battleground. Even if Han Sen did not care about his daughter’s life, he could concede and leave the space battleground. He did not have to be afraid of Han Sen.

“Han Sen, if you do not believe me, I can tell you that your daughter is wearing sunglasses. Those sunglasses are...” Yan Dan did not think Han Sen believed the story about Bao’er being taken away by Rocky Dee. Therefore, he described to him what Bao’er was wearing.

“I have never seen your daughter before, so I have no idea what she looked like,” Yan Dan said. “Do you believe me now? If you do not lose, then your daughter will have to die.”

Han Sen looked at Yan Dan coldly and said, “I believe you. I believed you from the beginning.” He was holding the Flying Yan Spears. They exploded with a weird power.

Yan Dan looked at Han Sen and asked, “If you believe it, then what are you going to do?”

“Kill you.” Han Sen was cold and emotionless when he said that.

When Han Sen’s voice was heard, the two Flying Yan spears in his hands underwent some changes. The indestructible spears were dissolved. They became the most primitive of substances. They appeared like smoke surrounding Han Sen.

The Flying Yan Spears’ souls followed Han Sen’s thoughts. He used their origins as a blueprint and dissolved the Flying Yan Spears.

This process did not require fire to burn them or a hammer to break them. This was a swap of the substance’s original form. It was perfect for others to reforge.

Emptiness and mist were going toward Han Sen’s hands. They formed the shape of something in Han Sen’s hands.

A black short bow appeared in Han Sen’s left hand, and a black arrow manifested in his right hand. The bow and arrow were releasing a powerful Empty God power.

Yan Dan’s eyes turned red. He madly spoke to Han Sen. “Do you not want your daughter to live? Is this fight more important than her life? If you do not concede, she will die. It will be a gruesome death too.”

“No one can kill my daughter. And you? You will die. Even a sky full of gods and demons will be unable to save you.” Han Sen put the black arrow against the short bow’s string and tugged it.

The bow was not big. The moment Han Sen pulled the string, Yan Dan’s heart still jumped. He developed a cold sweat. It was like he had suddenly been shrouded by an aura of death.

Yan Dan felt as if he was in the middle of a strong crisis that could quickly result in his doom. He knew Han Sen was going to kill him. He was not joking around.

Without hesitation, Yan Dan conceded. Although he did not like it, he could not keep going.

“Han Sen, your daughter is dead!” Yan Dan madly whispered to Han Sen. At the same time, a space tunnel appeared next to him. Yan Dan entered it, ready to leave the space battleground.

The audience of the seven kingdoms could not hear them speak, but they saw Yan Dan conceding. They knew the fight was going to end with Dollar emerging victorious.

They then heard Han Sen’s mad voice. “I said you are dying today!”

Yan Dan’s body was about to pass through the space tunnel. He looked as if he underestimated the scenario. “It is a shame you cannot kill me today, and you will never be able to.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Yan Dan already knew he had conceded and earned the protection of a God Spirit. A God Spirit would not allow a person who had conceded to be attacked, and he had already entered the space tunnel.

Han Sen pulled the bowstring as hard as he could and yelled, “No matter which God Spirit controls the space battleground, I, Dollar, will seal the space battleground and not allow anyone to leave! I want to kill someone!”

“Is he crazy?” When everyone heard Han Sen’s words, they were surprised. Yan Dan looked disdained.
