Gu Qingcheng was more direct. She took out her blade and rushed toward the armored man, summoning a powerful swordlight from her sword.

The fist and the sword hit each other, and the fire shook and the blade light shattered. The terrifying forces exploded, creating a hole that was larger than a basketball court in the indestructible battlefield.

The power of the attacks was already at the same level as Six Paths’ trump technique, and all the creatures watching were thrilled.

Han Sen frowned. It seemed that Gu Qingcheng’s blade technique was better than he thought. However, the armored man didn’t seem to care at all. The fire on his body got denser, and his power slowly grew.

The battlefield became covered in flames, completely surrounding Gu Qingcheng.

Then the entire battlefield looked like an exploding volcano, and the tumbling flames rushed to the sky. The flames were the only thing the audience could see; Gu Qingcheng and the armored man were nowhere to be found.

Peng!

A comet flew out of the flames and hit the wall of the battlefield hard enough to shake the stands. It was Gu Qingcheng’s body. She spewed out a mouthful of blood, which splashed everywhere.

There was ice covering Gu Qingcheng, and she looked like she had been coated in white powder.

In the next second, the fire flashed toward her again. Gu Qingcheng was terrified. She took a step back and went through a door of light She conceded and exited the battlefield.

Everyone watching the battle was completely shocked, and more than a little terrified.

Gu Qingcheng had shown such incredible power, but she could barely survive two strikes from the armored man. That display of power had shocked everyone into silence.

It was absolute power, and it was absolute suppression.

“Are you okay, sister Gu?” Han Sen walked toward Gu Qingcheng and supported her out of the Martial Hall. He could feel that her body was very cold, and just touching her made his palms feel like they were about to freeze and fall off.

“I’m not dying,” said Gu Qingcheng with her lips trembling.

“Come help her, Little Silver!” Han Sen called.

The silver lightning fell on Gu Qingcheng’s body, and after half an hour, Gu Qingcheng started to recover.

“It’s okay now.” After more than an hour, Gu Qingcheng seemed to be recovering a little. Little Silver then stopped treating her.

“Is the armored man really that strong, sister Gu?” asked Wang Yuhang.

Gu Qingcheng shook her head without saying anything. After leaving the Martial Hall, she told Han Sen to come and see her. “The armored man is indeed using the skills of a Taoist.”

“So he is actually Xu Fu?” asked Han Sen.

Gu Qingcheng shook her head and said, “No. Though he’s using the skills of a Taoist, his power doesn’t seem like a human’s. He feels more like a creature to me.”

Han Sen frowned and looked at Gu Qingcheng, as he didn’t know what Gu Qingcheng was trying to say.

Gu Qingcheng cleared her head and continued, “Do you think it’s possible for a creature to learn the skills of a Taoist?”

“Is that really possible? The powers of both creatures and spirits are inborn, so they can’t change them. They might be able to learn some techniques or concepts from humans, but the power itself couldn’t be changed,” Han Sen said thoughtfully.

Gu Qingcheng considered that for a moment. “You said that the armored man is staying in the Iron Chimenea, right? If it’s actually an ancient Chimenea, the creature might be training itself in the Chimenea in order to change its body enough to use the techniques of the Taoists.”

“A mutant creature with the power of a Taoist?” Han Sen was really disturbed.

Though Han Sen knew nothing about that era or how powerful the Taoists were, he could still tell from Gu Qingcheng that the Taoists were exceptional.

A powerful creature with the abilities of a Taoist was indeed a nightmare.

The armored man won again, and the news shocked everyone in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. They originally thought that Dollar might be able to fight that armored man, but after the fight with Gu Qingcheng, they all thought that Dollar would most likely be defeated by the armored man.

Even a random attack from the armored man could rival the most powerful strike from Six Paths. The power gap was obvious.

“How can there be such a powerful being in the Fourth Sanctuary? The fact that he still hasn’t broken space and become a god doesn’t make any sense.”

“Perhaps he’s a god fallen to the Fourth Sanctuary.”

“I don’t think there’ll be any suspense in the Divinity’s Bout this time. The armored man will be ranked first, and Dollar will come second.”

“Indeed, no suspense. That armored man is just too powerful.”

Even great beings like the master of Sacred shelter had given up. He just hoped that he could get into the top ten, and he didn’t count on getting first place anymore. The power of the armored man was making people desperate.

As for Han Sen, he didn’t think that way. The armored man was indeed incredible, but he wasn’t invincible; Gu Qingcheng survived two strikes from him, at least.

As long as he wasn’t invincible, Han Sen still had a chance.

Han Sen asked Gu Qingcheng about the details of her fight with the armored man, and about the kind of skills the armored man actually used.

According to Gu Qingcheng, the power the armored man used was the Dan Sha Technique, which was very famous in her era. He condensed power into a medication, and when that medication exploded, the power it yielded was much superior to what the armored man possessed himself.

Gu Qingcheng told Han Sen that the armored man’s body wasn’t much stronger than hers. The first strike of the armored man was the power of the armored man himself, and Gu Qingcheng was strong enough to rival it.

However, the power contained in the armored man’s medication was much stronger than Gu Qingcheng, and the second punch contained that sort of power. Gu Qingcheng couldn’t resist it, which was why she lost.

The Divinity’s Bout continued. Han Sen got into the ten Son of God’s. As for the armored man, nobody dared to fight him anymore, so he became one of the ten Son of God’s too.

After all ten Son of God’s were chosen, the Divinity’s Bout was over, and the final matches were the ranking competition for the top ten. Each Son of God needed to fight the other nine Son of God’s, thus giving the final ranking.

Everyone thought that the armored man would reach first place. Even some of the Son of God’s said that they wouldn’t fight the armored man. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After, all the creatures treasured their lives. Even the spirits who had the power of resurrection didn’t want to be killed for nothing.
