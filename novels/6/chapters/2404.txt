Chapter 2405: One Punch to Blow Up a God

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Han Sen made this wish because he wanted to know which great-granddad Han Jinzhi actually was. If Han Jinzhi had been an ordinary man, then he would have already died and left the world. In that case, God wouldn’t be able to find out where he was. At most, God would track him back to a gravesite.

If Han Sen’s great-granddad was actually the legendary figure he’d been told about, then Han Jinzhi had already escaped the powers of a God once. He must have been really powerful himself. This man who called himself God should have had a hard time finding someone like that.

Somewhere in the universe, on a planet, in a certain street, a fortune-teller was sitting on the road. He was eating noodles, making loud slurping noises as he sucked them down.

Suddenly, the fortune-teller’s face changed. He accidentally dropped the noodles onto the ground as he shouted, “Who is tricking me!”

The fortune-teller’s fingers twitched for a second. When he spoke again, his voice sounded furious. “That traitorous b*stard tricked me!”

While he was talking, the fortune-teller quickly pulled something out of his bag. He bit his middle finger and let a drop of blood fall onto the item. He mumbled, “What a shame. Getting this treasure took so much work. When I go back, I’m going to teach that little b*stard a lesson.”

A Fox was walking down the road, and she saw the fortune-teller holding an article of underwear decorated with flowers. He looked as if he was in pain. She stared at him, but the fortune-teller didn’t even seem to notice. His face remained twisted in discomfort.

In Destiny’s Tower, the man looked at Han Sen. The images reflected in his eyes kept changing, but all of them gleamed brightly.

Han Sen had made a wish. When the wish was complete, the man could use his power on Han Sen. Tracing Han Sen’s bloodline would be very easy, as it was just a basic power. It didn’t even require any special tricks.

As the spell ran, the man considered different ways he could maximize his earnings from someone making such a wish.

While he was in thought, the image in the man’s eyes kept changing. The gleam of power in those eyes was constant, but the images within them began to whirl faster and faster.

“Argh!” the man suddenly screamed. He covered his godly-looking eyes.

Han Sen frowned and looked at the man. He didn’t know what had happened. While he was wondering, he suddenly heard a pang! That man’s eyes exploded, leaving behind two black holes. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

From the empty air of the room around them, a god-like voice laughed darkly. “How dare you spy on me! This time, I’m only taking away your eyes. Next time, I will destroy your body.”

“No... impossible! How could you be his heir?! That is impossible!” screamed the man whose eyes had been incinerated.

“Who’s heir?” Han Sen asked the man.

Now he could see the wounds clearly. The holes in the man’s eyes weren’t flesh; they were rimmed with a jade-like substance. His eyes were completely destroyed, and there wasn’t a single drop of blood.

The eyeless man looked creepy. The empty pits stared at Han Sen as the man gnashed his teeth. “It doesn’t matter if you are his heir or not. You made a wish, and so, you must pay the price! Plus, there is no way you are his heir...”

“You haven’t told me where he is,” Han Sen said.

“He is where he should be,” the man said sternly.

“This is wrong. You have broken the rules!” Han Sen frowned.

“The rules are simple. I have done what you asked, and so, you must pay up.” The man looked quite angry.

“What if I don’t pay up?” Han Sen asked, glaring at the man.

“That isn’t up to you,” the man laughed in a grating voice. A light began to shine around his body, like the aura of some ancient sky god.

Han Sen’s face suddenly changed. He noticed his lifespan had been drastically reduced.

Normal creatures in the geno universe couldn’t detect their own lifespan, but Han Sen had come from the sanctuaries. He could see his own lifespan.

Han Sen’s maximum lifespan was reducing, year by year. It was transforming into a barely-visible light and drifting toward the man.

“If this place wasn’t Destiny’s Tower, you would be giving me more than just years from your lifespan for destroying my eyes!” the man seethed.

“That was unlucky. I made a wish and received nothing. And on top of that, my lifespan is being stolen. These so-called gods are quite fickle.”

Han Sen was furious, and he had to act. He couldn’t allow himself to lose any more years. He had already lost a dozen years, and the man was still sapping away even more. Han Sen didn’t know how much lifespan the man planned on taking in payment for this wish.

But now Han Sen understood why the Extreme King didn’t complain about the consequences of their wishes. A part of their lifespan was probably taken away, but unlike Han Sen, they had no way of knowing what was happening. Even if they did notice that something was different, they wouldn’t know how much of their lifespan had been stolen.

As his lifespan drained away, Han Sen felt something powerful activate inside his Sea of Soul. That black crystal armor hanging in his Sea of Soul suddenly moved.

Without Han Sen’s summoning, the black crystal armor appeared and floated in front of Han Sen. That black set of armor looked as if it could absorb all light. It made those who looked at it feel as if they were in the deepest recesses of hell.

Han Sen froze as he looked upon the black crystal armor. The moment the armor floated in front of him, his lifespan had stopped decreasing. His connection with the man had been severed as decisively as if it had been snipped with a pair of scissors. Han Sen stopped losing years.

“What is going on? I’ve only taken a dozen years, but it should have been 153 years... Why is this happening?” The man didn’t seem to notice the presence of the black crystal armor. He looked very confused. He turned his eyeless sockets back to Han Sen.

The empty pits that were once eyes stared at Han Sen. He obviously wasn’t adjusting well to his new handicap.

The black crystal armor, floating in front of Han Sen, lifted its gauntletted arm. In that moment, it looked more like a real person than an empty set of armor. It raised its hand and made a fist.

The black crystal armor walked up to the man, but he didn’t seem to notice it. When the black crystal armor stepped in front of the man, the clenched fist suddenly launched in a savage punch.

Boom!

The man’s body exploded. He was like a rock being reduced to powder in an instant. Beneath the power of that fist, he was nothing more than dust on the wind.

The man who had called himself God was blown up in a single punch.

An iridescent power that Han Sen could barely see rose from the exploded body. Then it drifted into Han Sen.

“Lifespan +1... Lifespan +1...”

Han Sen’s lifespan began to shoot upward. In seconds, he had earned an additional one hundred years. He was gaining lifespan much faster than he had lost it, and the process was still accelerating.

“Two hundred years... three hundred years... five hundred years...” Han Sen watched his own lifespan increase, and as he did, his heart began to pound. He felt as if it was going to jump out of his chest.
