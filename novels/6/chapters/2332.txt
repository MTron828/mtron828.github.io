Chapter 2333 Water Fairy

The water fairy sat behind Han Sen and massaged his shoulders. Han Sen was definitely enjoying the massage, but he was disappointed and couldn’t help but say, “It’s just a servant?”

It had taken a lot of work for Han Sen to get into the Pavilion, and he had also risked exposure. It wasn’t worth it if he had only gotten a servant girl for his efforts.

Bao’er leaned her head to the side and said, “I don’t know, but I think that she has another function.”

“Can she fight?” Han Sen asked.

Bao’er lifted the gourd and pointed at the chair. She shouted, “Hit it!”

The water fairy went to the chair immediately, but her watery body broke as soon as she came into contact with it. The chair moved a little, but no actual lasting damage had been done.

“It looks as if she doesn’t.” Bao’er shook her head.

“This can’t be the servant of the Sacred leader. The Extreme King’s alpha surely wouldn’t be this lame, leaving behind such a weak item for his children.” Han Sen looked at the water fairy.

Bao’er asked the water fairy to give her a massage. The water fairy complied with the directive immediately, so it seemed as if she lacked a will of her own. It was a high class doll.

Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to get a better look at the water fairy, and what he saw shocked him. The water fairy’s body was an energy substance, and it was very tightly constructed. It seemed to contain a deified power, the likes of which Han Sen hadn’t seen before.

“Weird. Such strong power, but why doesn’t it deal any damage? What does this thing actually do?” Han Sen thought to himself as he looked at the water fairy.

Bao’er was having fun with it, at least. While the water fairy was rubbing her shoulders, Bao’er also instructed it to begin feeding her.

“Bao’er, how do I make use of this jade gourd?” Han Sen asked after a moment of thought. Perhaps using the gourd himself would let him investigate it further.

“It’s easy. Just put your energy into the gourd.” Bao’er handed it back to Han Sen.

After the gourd left Bao’er’s hand, the water fairy shattered and returned to the jade gourd like liquid.

Han Sen tried putting his power into the jade gourd, but he couldn’t make it work. Then he tried it again, and when he put his power inside it, the jade gourd worked. The water fairy bound itself to Han Sen’s will and emerged from the jade gourd.

“This thing is strange, but I really don’t know what she does.” Han Sen tried a few commands, making sure he was able to control the water fairy. Then, he put the jade gourd and the water fairy away.

“Bao’er, did you get any information from your time with Lan Haixin?” Han Sen asked Bao’er.

Bao’er nodded and said, “She and Bai Yi had a meeting arranged for the ninth of next month. They will be opening the relic, and she says Bai Yi has the genes of another race in him. But the genes aren’t complete. She says the chances that the relic will select Bai Yi are low. She thinks she will be able to control the relic.”

“Did she tell you what the relic might have been?” Han Sen asked further, pleased with the revelations.

“No.” Bao’er shook her head and swallowed some food.

“Good. Keep gathering all the information you can. Once you have found something, try to find a way to reach me,” Han Sen said with a smile.

“I promise I will do that.” Bao’er looked so serious, and she gave Han Sen a salute.

“Good. You are the pride of the people and the nation, and you are the pride of your daddy, too.” Han Sen convinced Bao’er to go back. Then, he got to thinking about what he himself might need to do.

The little red bird followed after Bao’er, but Han Sen didn’t worry about her.

Han Sen was most worried about the ramifications of the previous day. He hadn’t known that opening the alpha statue would cause so much trouble, and right now, the entire Extreme King society was still in the midst of dealing with their shock. Many eyes would be focused on him in the times to come.

“Considering Bai Yi’s pride and desire for attention, he wouldn’t maintain a low profile after suddenly becoming so famous. I need to go somewhere.” Han Sen got to thinking about where he should go.

Han Sen looked at the blood kirin, and then his eyes turned bright. “Yes! I should make the blood kirin register as my royal guard. Then, I can go to King’s Garden to steal a primary root king dragon. Only the princes and princesses are allowed to go to King’s Garden. No one there is deified. I still can’t reveal myself, but at least I won’t be left exposed to the people most likely to see through my disguise. And I can steal plenty of resources. Right, I should do that. I should go to King’s Garden.”

After Han Sen said that, he took the blood kirin with him and registered it as a royal guard. Then, he rushed to King’s Garden.

“My Prince, Bai Yi has left home. He took the blood kirin to register as a royal guard. And now, he is going to King’s Garden.”

“My Princess, Bai Yi took the blood kirin to King’s Garden.”

The same report was delivered to each and every palace. Many princes and princesses now raced to King’s Garden.

They wanted to know what was going on with Bai Yi. The idea that he had claimed the alpha’s statue was way too strange, and many royal children thought it was suspicious.

“He is out? I want to see if this is actually Bai Yi, or if it is really Han Sen.” Miss Mirror was holding a big mirror that reflected Han Sen’s movement inside King’s Garden. She paid special attention to the ring Han Sen was still wearing. Every few seconds, Miss Mirror would turn her eyes to glance at that ring. Then, she unconsciously touched the identical ring she wore on her own finger.

Han Sen had gone there with Bai Wei once, so he knew the way to go. He brought the blood kirin with him to King’s Garden.

Han Sen wasn’t fond of the bearded dragons, and he rode the blood kirin towards the king tree. He wanted to find one of those thick, primary root king dragons.

But as soon as the blood kirin started to move, a few shadows appeared before them. Han Sen examined them and realized it was a bunch of people he had never seen before.

He recognized some of them from the information Mister White had given him, however. The first one was Prince Swordstar. He was the forty-seventh royal child, and he was Bai Yi’s little brother. But he wasn’t from the same mother. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Brother Forty-Seven, why are you blocking my way?” Han Sen asked, his expression gloomy.

Prince Swordstar smiled. He looked quite handsome as he said, “I am here to congratulate you, Brother Sixteen, on acquiring an understanding of the Extreme King alpha. And I am curious what the Extreme King alpha left behind in the Pavilion. I hope you will be able to tell me.”

“And what if I don’t tell you?” Han Sen asked with a chuckle.

“Then this little brother is going to have to teach you a lesson,” Prince Swordstar said coldly.

“Ha! You aren’t worthy of challenging me. Beat my guard first,” Han Sen replied haughtily.

The blood kirin roared. A red mist covered its body, exerting intense pressure on the surrounding area. A blood shadow came right for Prince Swordstar.

“You aren’t the only one who has a guard.” Prince Swordstar’s face didn’t change. Without a command, his own guard leaped out to fight the blood kirin.
