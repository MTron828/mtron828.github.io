Chapter 3096 Birthday Gift

After Han Sen told them his shop name, Feng Fei Fei thought it sounded familiar. But she paid in no true mind and did not make the connection. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Everyone was talking and laughing. The shadow of the big sky demon suddenly appeared next to Han Sen. She came from behind and held Han Sen’s chest. She whispered into his ear, “My little lover, that pretty singer has been doomed by a gene race. She is dying. Do you want to let her die?”

“Which one?” Han Sen whispered back at a volume only he could hear. He looked at the pure light salamander in his pocket. While the pure light salamander did react, it was to other gene races. It did not detect the big sky demon.

“Of course, it is Feng Fei Fei. She is such a beautiful woman, even I like her. Later, she will be bleeding all over her face. Her skin will fall off, and she will die. What a shame.” The big sky demon placed her lips right next to Han Sen’s ear. She used a seductive tone to speak into Han Sen’s ear.

Han Sen looked at Feng Fei Fei. Although he did not know much about gene races, he had learned a thing or two. He could not tell whether or not Feng Fei Fei was doomed by a gene race, but he could tell Feng Fei Fei was not well. Her face looked strangely red. Other people would have thought she had makeup on, such as some blush on the cheeks girls frequently used. Han Sen knew the red possessed an evil power. There was a tint of blood in Feng Fei Fei’s black eyes. One would have been unable to tell it was there if one did not look closely. It was weird. It was like blood snakes were writhing around.

Thinking about Feng Fei Fei suddenly bleeding from her nose earlier, he thought what the big sky demon told him might be true.

“How do I break the clutch that gene race has on Feng Fei Fei?” Han Sen quietly asked.

If it was just the average Feng Fei Fei having this issue, he would not have cared. But Feng Fei Fei was Little Yin’s auntie, and they seemed close. Han Sen did not want to see Little Yin be upset. Now that he knew this, he could not just sit and watch. “It is a si ming demon race,” the big sky demon said with a smile. “It is a rare god-class gene race. Its master grew this si ming demon race to the ultimate level. If you had noticed sooner, you might have been able to get rid of it. Now, her soul has been wholly consumed by it. You cannot remove its presence now.”

“So, can she be saved?” Han Sen asked.

The big sky demon sighed and said, “No. If you really like her, I can try to save her. But it will be very hard. I will require your assistance.”

“How do I help you?” Han Sen asked.

“It is very simple,” the big sky demon said. “Just use your blood to draw a spell, my love. Put the blood spell on her, then you can remove the si ming demon race power.” Han Sen smiled. He did not believe a word big sky demon was telling him. The big sky demon wanted a blood spell to probably go against his own wishes.

“My love, if you do not save her, she really will perish,” the big sky demon calmly said. “Look at her ears if you do not believe me.”

Han Sen looked at Feng Fei Fei’s ear. Due to the fact he and Feng Fei Fei were sitting next to Little Yin, he could see Feng Fei Fei’s left ear was extremely red. It was like she was drunk.

It was a red that most people assumed wasn’t a problem. When Han Sen looked closer, he saw her ear possess vibrant, strained veins that were spreading like a web.

The si ming demon race was something too rare. Even many nobles had never heard of its existence. It was also the best part of the party. No one had noticed something had happened to Feng Fei Fei. They would have assumed she had become drunk with ease.

Although Han Sen knew Feng Fei Fei had something wrong with her, he did not know much about gene races. He did not know how to erase the gene race power on Feng Fei Fei. Seeing Han Sen not do anything, the big sky demon sighed and said, “Little Loser, you think too much. If you do not want to lose your blood, there is only one other way. You have got a blood ghost spirit gene race. That blood ghost spirit power can suppress the si ming demon race, but it can only suppress it. You cannot completely erase it. For that, you require a special skill. “What do I do?” Han Sen quietly asked.

The big sky demon was fast. She told Han Sen the method required. He had no idea what she was thinking.

The party went on swimmingly. Once it was past midnight, the place flickered in the glow of fireworks. Everyone was celebrating Feng Yin Yin’s birthday.

After the celebration, Feng Fei Fei put a box in front of Feng Yin Yin. She nicely said, “Little Yin, this is a gift from your auntie. See if you like it.”

“Thank you, Auntie.” Feng Yin Yin opened the box immediately. She did it every year, so she was used to it.

When Feng Yin Yin opened the box, she saw a gene egg inside it that was shining like a gem. There was even magical music coming out from the gene egg.

Feng Yin Yin only knew this was a gene egg. She did not know what sort of gene egg it was.

Si Tu Ya saw the gene egg and became extremely jealous. She maintained her calm and said, “Little Yin, your auntie is so nice to you. This is a very famous sonic gene race. It is an autumn cicada. Although autumn cicadas are a marquise gene race, it is a very rare one. It is especially useful for singers. The autumn cicadas can provide the wielder a very cold, autumnal voice. The voice might be a bit rough, but the songs you sing will be very touching. Many singers want autumn cicadas.”

The last sentence Si Tu Ya said was true. She wanted an autumn cicada, but the autumn cicadas were too rare. Although it was marquise class, to singers, it was more important than a king-class gene race. No matter who it was, they would cherish the autumn cicadas. No one would sell it. It was something most people could not buy with money.

“Thank you, Auntie. I love it.” Feng Yin Yin grabbed Feng Fei Fei by the neck and kissed her.

“I am glad you like it. The autumn cicada actually suits adults more. I was planning to give you a mutant eight sound bug since that would be more suitable for you, but…” Feng Fei Fei stopped talking. She thought about the mutant eight sound bug costing 10 million. It was not something she was able to purchase. The young man next to them said, “The eight sound bugs are not hard to find, but the mutant eight sound bug is a priceless treasure. It is rarer than an autumn cicada. It will be very hard to find. You already did well for finding an autumn cicada.”

Everyone said something similar. Feng Yin Yin said she liked the autumn cicada too.

“I wonder what Mister Han will provide as a gene race,” a woman said. “It cannot be a mutant eight sound bug.” She was making fun of him.

That woman was supposed to be on the main table, but Feng Yin Yin sat Han Sen in her seat and kicked her away. She felt humiliated, so she hated Han Sen. She could not help but mock him and make him look bad.
