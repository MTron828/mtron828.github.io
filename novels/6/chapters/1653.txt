Chapter 1654 Ancient Sky

“Are people from Sacred joining the hunt?” Han Sen asked.

Cheap Sheep thought for a moment and then said, “I think so. Someone saw Goddess and other Sacred elites heading for Sunset Valley. If you want to go and take a look, please take us with you!”

“This shelter needs you guys. Who else could manage it if you are away?” Han Sen smiled.

Cheap Sheep and Green Cow smiled. They patted their chests and said, “Don’t worry, then! With us here, this shelter will be taken care of with the utmost diligence. There is no need for you to worry.”

“Yep; it’s down to you two.” Han Sen patted Cheap Sheep and Green Cow on their shoulders. He complimented them again, then returned to the Alliance.

“Sacred is sending people to kill Death Goddess? It looks like they don’t know she was the God Egg that was stolen by Destroyer Wolf. Judging from her appearance and power, though, the Sacred leader should have recognized who she was. I wonder why he couldn’t.” Han Sen thought about this for a while. The next day, he collected Bao’er, Little Silver, and Little Star, and took them with him to Sunset Valley.

Han Sen wanted to find out what was up with Death Goddess, and he fancied a bit of revenge.

Han Sen felt more relaxed on his travel this time, and there was no rush or need to kill creatures along the way. He went straight for Sunset Valley uninterrupted. The title Skysword was not something without weight; many creatures and spirits that might have thought to bother him, ran away when they realized who was coming.

When he neared the valley, many other elites had already shown up. Again, they did not provoke Han Sen, for they knew all about Skysword.

Death Goddess would take an extra few days to reach Sunset Valley, but the reason for her delay wasn’t explained. She was supposed to be traveling in a straight line to get there, so no one was really sure what was going on with her sluggishness.

The super elites that were invited by Illusion had all gathered there.

When Han Sen arrived, he was initially stopped.

“Skysword, what are you doing here? Illusion did not invite you.” A beast belonging to Illusion had stopped Han Sen to question him.

“I go wherever I want. This isn’t your territory, so you have no authority to control who comes and goes,” Han Sen said coldly.

The beast was maddened by that, but before he made a move, many scary lifeforces began to approach. One of them was the Illusion Elder.

There were three elites that were of the same strength standing next to him. They must have been the other alphas. There were super elites like Goddess and elites from Sacred, too. Alpha class elites did not participate in Divinity’s Bout, but they were incredibly powerful, and they definitely had the abilities to match a Son of God.

But their numbers there meant Han Sen couldn’t do anything.

“Skysword, Illusion has no quarrel with you. If you are here to help, we appreciate it. And your contributions will be rewarded. If not, please do us a favor and return to whence you came.” The Illusion Elder spoke to Han Sen with a frown.

“You do your thing. I’ll watch and not interfere. We won’t bother each other.” After Han Sen said that, he set up an airbed and took out a bunch of snacks to munch on. Bao’er and Little Silver dug right in, chowing down as if they were there for a proper picnic.

Those of Illusion were enraged, and the other elites frowned sternly.

The elder stopped the members from doing anything, though. And he said, “Focus on your mission. If he doesn’t enter the valley, just leave him be.”

After that, Illusion Elder looked at Han Sen one last time, and then returned deeper into the valley.

Han Sen stayed outside the valley, waiting for Death Goddess to arrive.

There were many elites waiting in Sunset Valley to kill Death Goddess, and there was no need to risk having them all as enemies. When the target appeared, he’d also have a chance to sneak in.

But Han Sen was not being lazy there. When night fell, he used his Dongxuan Aura to hide himself. Then, he snuck into Sunset Valley in the hopes of seeing what they were all up to.

They could surely take Death Goddess down anywhere, if they had a plan. So, there had to be a reason for them choosing Sunset Valley for a showdown.

After Han Sen snuck inside, he noticed there was a surprising number of elites. There were far more than what he had seen from the outside. There had to be at least a hundred.

And there were a few alphas amongst them, too. A formation like this was something even Han Sen would think twice about attacking.

Even if Han Sen was not afraid of fighting against large numbers, he didn’t know what geno cores the alphas possessed. If they had special powers, not being able to use super king spirit would put him at a major disadvantage.

After sneaking across a distance of a few hundred miles, Han Sen saw an ancient mirror in the valley.

That mirror was around a hundred meters tall. It was gleaming brightly, reflecting the activity of everyone before it. But due to its size, its length partitioned the valley.

“What are they doing with such a big mirror here? What kind of geno core is that?” Han Sen thought about it for a while, but he had no idea what the giant mirror might have been used for.

Not far away from the mirror, the elders rested. A few of the alphas were in deep discussion. They were all holding a big flag that was caked in dust. Due to the sound of the flag rippling in the breeze, Han Sen could not discern what they were talking about.

Han Sen hugged the wall and did not move. He cast the Dongxuan Sutra to see if he could listen through the noise generated by the flag and hear what they were saying.

The flag was powerful, and Han Sen’s Dongxuan Aura could not work on it.

Just as he was disappointed about this, he overheard another two from Illusion having a discussion.

“This time, we have four alphas and the ancient mirror. I really think we can kill Death Goddess and achieve vengeance.”

“Oh yeah, so what is this Ancient Sky Mirror? Can it suppress Death Goddess’ arrows? If they can’t be stopped, we will be injured even if we can’t kill her.”

“Don’t worry, it’ll work. Ancient Sky Mirror is Ancient Sky Emperor’s geno core. With the mirror here, we don’t have to be afraid of Death Goddess.”

“Why is that?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“The alpha said it was a secret, but we’ll find out soon enough.”

Han Sen listened to a bit more but learned nothing useful. Then, he decided to leave Sunset Valley. But Han Sen had already figured out that the Ancient Sky Mirror was for the alphas to restrict her.
