Chapter 1786 Angry Steel Army

In a town in the north, the Taurus Viscount—whose name was Angry Steel—was looking at the image in front of him. He was watching the Seven Mirrors airship.

Next to Angry Steel, there was a man. He had purple eyes and hair, horns, and white clothes. He, too, was watching the videostream.

If Han Sen had seen that white-clothed man, he’d have been very shocked. And that was because the man looked like a shura from the Alliance.

Angry Steel looked glum. He was standing next to a master of the Demon bloodline, and Angry Steel had been wanting to show off the Angry Steel Army’s power. He wanted to impress the Demon, and perhaps be considered for placement as one of the higher races.

But before he could show the man anything, this unfortunate event had transpired.

Killing the Kate people was not the mistake. The biggest mistake was for so many warriors, Baron-leader included, to be ruthlessly murdered by another Baron. It all happened so swiftly; it was embarrassing.

“Mister Viscount, Taurus warriors do seem to be a little special, as you have been keen to express. Many of them surrounded a Baron, and all of them were haplessly murdered. They don’t look strong, I’ll tell you that much.” Next to the Demon master, there was a woman with two horns. But her horns were golden, and they were different from the master’s horns.

Angry Steel Viscount lowered his head to the master and said, “I am sorry, Mister Ji. It was me merely being useless.”

Mister Ji shook his head and said, “That person is a Baron, but he is good. This isn’t entirely your fault Order your ten captains to go there and keep him busy.”

Angry Steel Viscount quickly said, “My best captain, Greatsword Viscount, is already there. He can kill the person with ease.”

Mister Ji looked at the video but did not speak. The lady Demon sneered and said, “Why are you talking so much crap? Are you really that stupid? We need ten of your captains to go, not just this single one!”

Angry Steel Viscount felt a little enraged by her chastisement, but he refrained from showing it He nodded and said, “Yes, I will order all ten captains to go at once.”

Angry Steel Viscount thought Greatsword Viscount was enough to deal with the mystic Baron, but he still gave the order to send everyone out there.

Greatsword Viscount was already there, and he was running at Han Sen. Angry Steel Viscount thought to himself, “If Mister Ji says I have to do this, then I have to do this. I definitely don’t want to upset him. But Greatsword Viscount can definitely kill that person. He doesn’t need anyone else. It’ll just be for show.”

Angry Steel Viscount watched the video feed confidently as Greatsword Viscount rushed straight at Han Sen. Its powerful body had considerable momentum, and it was very shocking to witness. It was like the very planet was shaking.

And in regards to his performance, Angry Steel Viscount was satisfied. Greatsword Viscount was not the strongest leader amongst Angry Steel Army, but he was most certainly the most intimidating one. Otherwise, Angry Steel wouldn’t have selected him to become the top-ranked captain.

Greatsword Viscount jumped a distance of a few dozen meters. A large flame enwreathed the greatsword he wielded. His strength and speed were perfect, and the sight of it was beautiful.

“This is it. Kill that Baron! Let Mister Ji know that Angry Steel Army is strong,” Angry Steel Viscount thought to himself. Mister Ji was looking at Greatsword Viscount, when he suddenly smiled.

Lao Zhuoma looked pale. He was worried for Han Sen and the Kate that had not yet boarded the ship.

The door was too narrow. There was a limit to how many people could get on board, all at the same time. Only half of the group had successfully made it inside the ship. The other half were still out in the open.

There were mostly old people, women, and children outside now. Only a few young men were valiant enough to help them get in.

If Han Sen was killed, the army would return to finish them all off, and the deaths would be many.

Lao Zhuoma looked on strangely. Why Han Sen was fighting Greatsword Viscount was a mystery to him, and if he had decided to just evade the foe, he’d surely survive longer. He could have even run off.

But Han Sen was heading towards Greatsword Viscount directly, with no thought of escaping.

When the onlookers saw the greatsword swinging down, they knew the blow would be something not even a steel airship could withstand.

Han Sen did not move. His left hand held onto the Gold Feather Bow as his right hand clutched the horn arrows. He pulled the string back as far as it could go, and he took aim at Greatsword Viscount.

The bow was a weapon that exceeded expectations at range, but Greatsword Viscount was within melee distance of Han Sen. The burning steel greatsword was going to come against the bow, and Han Sen had yet to fire.

“Die!” Greatsword Viscount roared, as the muscles in his body tightened. He unleashed a scary power that looked like it would crush Han Sen and the ship.

As this occurred, Han Sen unleashed the arrow. The whoosh of its travel sounded as the arrow rushed forward like a toxic cobra strike.

It seemed too late to fire now, though. Greatsword Viscount’s greatsword was going to come into contact with the horn arrow, then probably carry on through to hit Han Sen.

Greatsword Viscount wore a horrible smile, and he kept roaring. He gripped the sword tightly as he pushed more of his rage into the weapon. He was three inches away from the arrow.

But the horn arrow disappeared right before Greatsword Viscount Nothing collided with the steel greatsword. Han Sen turned and went right past him like a butterfly. He ended up at the foe’s side.

Greatsword Viscount wished to strike again, but it was then that the creature noticed the vanishing arrow had re-appeared. Before he could react, the horn arrow raced through his mouth as he was shouting.

The arrow was spinning incredibly quickly. It came up through his throat, bulldozing its way into his brain. It came out again, spraying brain matter and juice all about

Han Sen kept on going past Greatsword Viscount, not even concerned enough to look at the beast. He reclaimed the arrow and moved forward. Greatsword Viscount’s team was still in the area.

Greatsword Viscount’s body fell backward, creating a dozen-meter-long trail. The corpse twitched, as brain juice leaked and poured out everywhere. He was going to die.

Han Sen had no reaction, like this was an every-day activity for him. But Lao Zhuoma and Mike were in shock, and even Angry Steel Viscount was floored. None of them could believe their eyes.

For a Viscount Taurus to go out like that was crazy, especially when its enemy was simply a Baron. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The team of Taurus warriors had been fighting in a bloodthirsty rage, but after watching Greatsword Viscount be murdered, they were in massive shock. They no longer looked intimidating. In fact, they looked rather scared.
