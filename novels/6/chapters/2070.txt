2071 Cocky Red Cloud

Lone Bamboo chased the red cloud up into the air, slashing faster and faster with his blade. But the red cloud was way too quick, and it managed to avoid each and every one of Lone Bamboo’s sword airs.

“I will help!” Han Sen drew his knife and swung it towards the red cloud. He summoned the wings on his ears, and his speed increased.

The red cloud sped up even faster and evaded Han Sen. He had suspected this would occur, though. He had managed to predict where the cloud would accelerate, so he adjusted his aim in front of the red cloud.

It wouldn’t matter how fast the red cloud was if an attack was moving through its flight path.

But instead of continuing forward at the same speed, the red cloud immediately slowed down again. Han Sen’s attack went harmlessly past it.

“Tricky little thing.” Han Sen frowned, but he kept on swinging.

Lone Bamboo and Han Sen continued their assault on the red cloud without making contact. The red cloud could not escape, though, as it was constantly forced to avoid the attacks of the two.

“Now!” Han Sen was calculating all of the red cloud’s possible escape routes, and he kept waving his Blood Feather Knife like mad. He created a net with his knife silks to ensnare the foe.

But the red cloud did not stop moving, and its speed was teleportation-like. The knife silks were unable to even touch it.

Seeing the red cloud accelerate yet again, Han Sen finally realized something. This creature wasn’t using a sudden burst of speed as it tried to escape, as a rabbit might. This creature always moved this fast. It suddenly made sense that the creature was never afraid.

The red cloud was traveling around like a rocket, leaving behind a wake of red mist. It soon became apparent that the creature had used its contrails to write the word stupid.

“D*mn, this guy is smart! It can use the common language.” Han Sen’s eyes opened wide as he stared at the clouds.

“It’s just a Marquise, but when the Sky came here, it already lived on Rainbow Cloud Peak. After all these years, its intelligence and power must way exceed that of an ordinary cloud beast. But Marquise is the highest level one can achieve here. There are no resources to support a higher tier than that. If there were, it would be even more powerful,” Lone Bamboo said.

“Don’t worry. When I catch him, we’ll take him for a walk and level him up quick,” Han Sen said, while looking at the red cloud.

The red cloud soared through the air with great speed. The red mist contrails started to spell out another word: bullsh*t. And then, the red clouds formed an emoji that seemed to look down on them in disdain.

And then, the clouds started to twist. They formed a red hand, producing one lifted finger at Han Sen.

“D*mn! This guy is a troll!” Han Sen summoned his dragon wings and took off after the red cloud.

As the red cloud sped up and evaded his knife air, Han Sen flapped his dragon wings and appeared above the creature.

And then, Han Sen struck downwards. As he did, he said, “You b*stard! Try being cocky now.”

There was only a small distance to close, but Han Sen’s knife could not match the speed of the red cloud. His knife only needed to move the distance of a hair’s thickness, but the knife air could not catch up. The creature sped away, widening the distance between them again.

Han Sen watched as the creature ran away, and then the clouds twisted into a smug emoji. It looked as if the emoji was having a smoke.

Han Sen smiled evilly and used Blood Feather Knife. Invisible knife silks were spun into a net, and they were sent flying over to the red cloud.

The red cloud hit the knife silks, but the cloud itself was like tofu, and it was sheared away.

Han Sen controlled the knife silks well, though. He had no plan to kill it just yet.

“How cocky are you going to be now?” Han Sen shouted at the red cloud.

Suddenly, the cloud accelerated again. It went towards the knife silks, but it was cut to pieces by the fine strands.

Han Sen frowned. He only wanted to teach the beast a lesson, not kill it.

The red cloud didn’t hesitate, though. It maintained course, still flying with blinding speed. The knife silks cut it to ribbons, but those ribbons gathered back into one cottony cloud. Then it presented Han Sen the shape of a thumbs down.

“That stupid cloud is strong!” Han Sen thought. “That’s f*cking creepy.”

It was incredibly fast, and its body could be shattered. Han Sen wasn’t sure how that thing could be caught.

Lone Bamboo tried to snare it a few times, but he failed every time, too. They were the two fastest Marquise there were, but they were unable to catch up with the red cloud.

Even if Han Sen used teleport to reach the red cloud and attack, the red cloud’s speed and reaction times would still enable it to dodge the knife airs and shockwaves. The longer they tried to capture the red cloud, the more they respected it. Not even a Duke could handle this creature.

Even if he hit the cloud, there was no point. It had a body that was like water, and after parts of it were lopped off, it’d just recompose easily.

Lone Bamboo spun his jade sword into something that resembled a tornado. The giant sword air vortex reached out to the red cloud, trying to suck the creature inside.

The red cloud sped up and escaped the grasp of the sword vortex. Even that was ineffective.

There was nothing Lone Bamboo could do against it, and he had lost against it just like Han Sen. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“It’s no wonder it has survived this long, and it still hasn’t been tamed by Sky Palace students. This thing is powerful!” Lone Bamboo mused.

“It is, but it cannot attack,” Han Sen said.

There was currently no hope in catching up to the red cloud, so Lone Bamboo abandoned the quest for the moment. He said, “I will catch a normal Marquise cloud beast. What about you?”

“It’s fine. I have my Legless Crane. I don’t want to swap it out.” Han Sen shook his head. Unless he found something like the red cloud, he could run faster than a normal Marquise xenogeneic, anyway. There was no point in getting another random mount. The Legless Crane was enough for him.

Lone Bamboo caught a Marquise cloud bird. It didn’t take much to catch it. Ordinary Marquise creatures were slower than Lone Bamboo, and he managed to nab it with ease.

When Han Sen and Lone Bamboo were just about to leave, the cocky red cloud followed them. It flew in front of them and spelled out more words with the vapor. “Dumb*ss! Dumb*ss! Come and catch me.”

Han Sen’s eyebrows rose. That beast could use an exclamation mark.

“F*ck! I have to take you. Othewise, I am done calling myself Han Sen.” Han Sen felt angry, but he did not turn around He knew he couldn’t catch the red cloud right now. But he would find a way to get it eventually.
