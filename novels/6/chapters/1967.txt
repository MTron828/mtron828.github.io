Chapter 1968 The Seventh Floor

The woman heard him and smiled. “You are very funny. My name is Yun Sushang. I am a student of the Tenth Elder. You can call me Senior.”

“Greetings, Senior Yun,” Han Sen said, suddenly feeling like he was back in school. It was actually a nice feeling. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yun Sushang pointed at the Buddha man and said, “His name is First Day. The Buddha sent him here to study in Sky Palace, just like you.”

“Amitabha! Greetings, Mister Han.” First Day bowed before Han Sen.

Han Sen did not like the Buddha, but he didn’t think that every single one of them was a bad person. He didn’t know First Day, though, so he had no immediate reason to hate the man. That being said, he still wanted to avoid being First Day’s friend. After the introductions, Han Sen turned to Thousand Feather Crane.

“Thousand Feather, I thought you said there were twelve White Jade Buildings. But I have only seen this one.” If Han Sen couldn’t achieve a breakthrough on the seventh floor, he thought that he might need a place with an even stronger Jade Air.

“There are twelve buildings and five cities in White Jade Jing. Most people only see the twelve White Jade Buildings, not the five cities. Consequently, they can only enter this one place. If you wish to enter the others, you must first understand the other towers,” Thousand Feather Crane said.

“What is there to leam?” Han Sen asked.

“I don’t know. It’s just something you have to learn. It’s hard for me to explain. But I think you should practice on the third or fourth floor. You can start thinking about moving on when you reach the fifth or sixth floor,” Thousand Feather Crane said.

Han Sen wished to say something, but someone suddenly entered the seventh floor. It was Yun Suyi. They had met on the third floor.

Yun Suyi, upon seeing Han Sen, was shocked. When the Jade Air passed, Han Sen had vanished. She had believed that he had been unable to withstand it, and so he decided to leave. She didn’t expect that Han Sen had already gone to the top, looking for Thousand Feather Crane.

“Suyi, let me introduce you. This is Knife Queen’s student Han Sen.” Yun Sushang pulled Yun Suyi near and smiled.

“I met him already, down below,” Yun Suyi answered.

Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang were sisters. They were the heirs of the Tenth Elder. Yun Suyi had blood, while Yun Sushang was a step-daughter. Yun Sushang was the Seventh Elder’s daughter, but he had died. Yun Sushang was taken in by Yun Suyi’s father while she was still young.

Thousand Feather Crane was also a student of the Tenth Elder, so he was close with the Yun sisters.

The sisters had a good relationship, as fine as any real siblings. Since they had a little while before White Jade Jing opened again, Yun Suyi had come to talk to Yun Sushang and kill some time.

Han Sen asked Thousand Feather Crane, “Thousand Feather, I’m curious about the Jade Air of the other twelve buildings. Are they stronger?”

Before he could answer, Yun Suyi said, “They’re not just stronger. They have spirit. If you’re not an Earl at least, you’ll die there. Don’t even think about going elsewhere. Just stay here and practice.”

“So if I become an Earl, I can go to the other twelve buildings?” Han Sen asked.

“You have to understand the knowledge of the White Jade Buildings. Only then can you see the other buildings behind this one,” Yun Suyi said.

“Thousand Feather Crane, Yun Sushang, and First Day are the best of the Earls. Can they not understand this knowledge?” Han Sen thought to himself. He knew it was something he shouldn’t say out loud.

Yun Suyi knew what Han Sen was thinking, however. She smiled. “Brother Crane and my sister already understand. Many people on the sixth floor already understand, too. But of the twelve buildings, this first one is the most tamed. The Jade Air here is the easiest to refine, so it is best to stay here until you are a Marquise.”

Upon hearing this, Han Sen frowned in thought. “If the Jade Air here is considered mild, how scary must the Jade Air be in the other buildings? If I can’t break through here, maybe I can go to the other White Jade Buildings. I just don’t know what I need to understand about these constructs.”

After talking for a while, Yun Sushang suddenly noticed the time. Then, she spoke to Yun Suyi. “The Jade Air is going to erupt. Go back now. We will speak later when this is done.”

Yun Suyi nodded and headed for the stairs. Han Sen was still talking to Thousand Feather Crane, so she said, “You should come. When the Jade Air arrives, you will become a jade statue before you have a chance to return to the third floor.”

“Brother Han, head on down. We will talk later,” Thousand Feather Crane said.

“I’m not going back. I want to practice here,” Han Sen said.

Yun Suyi and the others all looked at Han Sen. Yun Suyi found herself both angry and amused. “Even most Earls do not dare come to the seventh floor. Only my sister and Brother Crane, who are both so talented and stronger than the average Earl, dare to practice here. Did you not see the swathe of Earls down on the sixth floor? They don’t dare come up. What do you think a Viscount can do here? Do you want to become a statue?”

“Brother Han, you should go downstairs. You have to do this floor-by-floor,” Thousand Feather Crane said.

Han Sen laughed and said, “My skills have maxed out! I need the seventh floor’s Jade Air to break through. Don’t worry;

I can fight against the Jade Air here. I’ll be fine.”

Yun Suyi started to say something else, but Yun Sushang cut her off. “Suyi, go now. The Jade Air will soon erupt, and it’ll be too late for you to leave when it does.”

Yun Suyi left the seventh floor and paced quickly down the stairs. She kept looking back, but she did not see Han Sen following after her.

“This guy isn’t strong, but he is ambitious. Brother Crane will have to carry him down, again,” Yun Suyi thought to herself.

Thousand Feather Crane and Yun Sushang tried to convince Han Sen, but they were not really friends. If Han Sen wanted to stay that much, they weren’t going to plead against the idea.

Thousand Feather Crane smiled wryly and shook his head. If Han Sen could not withstand the force, then he would carry him down. He could not allow the Jade Air to turn Han Sen into a statue and kill him.

Han Sen found a spot that was closer to Thousand Feather Crane. First Day looked at Han Sen curiously, and Han Sen shot him a smile. First Day looked shy, and then turned away.

“This First Day Buddha is interesting. He is so young and so strong. He might be as good as Seven Spirit. His mind is still like a kid’s, though,” Han Sen thought. Then, the jade walls began to emit a Jade Air.
