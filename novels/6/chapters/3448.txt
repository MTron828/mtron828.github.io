Chapter 3449 Littleflower’s God Body

Human King thought, “It does not matter how great Han Sen’s genes are. He cannot compete with the most powerful gene in the universe. Only I can take that step.” The way he looked at Littleflower was more polite. He smiled and said, “Actually, to be serious about all of this, you guys and your father Han Sen are actually descendants of mine. You are a part of my bloodline. In some way, you guys are my heirs. We are family, no matter which way you look at it. Bao’er is not your father’s real daughter. She does not have human genes inside her. She is not related to you guys. Why are you killing each other on behalf of an outsider? Just hand Bao’er over, and I will refrain from hurting you guys. After all, I am your ancestor.”

Littleflower did not move an inch. The holy power around him became stronger and stronger. The area that was covered by his power was completely purified. The glow was able to recover the rules of all the substances. The broken buildings and plants were even recovering The broken building was like new once more. The snapped trees healed. It was like everything was coming back to life. “Human King, I do not care if you are an ancestor mine. Regardless of what you think, Bao’er is my big sister. Her having my blood in her veins means diddly-squat to me. She is my big sister either way.” Littleflower walked toward Human King and proceeded to say, “Even if she was not my sister, I would not allow her beautiful smile to be taken away by a wretched man like you.”

“By the way, let me say this again, get your dirty hands off her.” After that, Littleflower threw a punch toward Human King. A scary, hole power gathered up on the fist and became extremely bright.

“In that case, I have no choice. You guys have my blood. I was going to give you guys a chance, but it looks like you guys do not cherish my generosity.” Human King’s hands grabbed Han Ling’er. Another hand clutched a fist. He punched toward Littleflower’s fist. “So, I will now show you the meaning of real power.”

The black crystal armor had been burned by the golden door’s gold light, but the power that was released was still incredible.

The geno prototype armor’s power had all the miraculous facets of life’s genes. Having the geno prototype armor meant one could use all sorts of life powers. It could make all the life genes evolve, so they could also destroy and break all the genes.

Human King’s punch had the geno prototype armor’s power. Under the black fist, everything was dissolved and broken. Even the soul ended up becoming the most primitive of substances.

Two fists were now set to collide in a cosmic display of force and power. One of them was black like demonic coal, whereas the other was sparkling white with a holy incandescence. There were two fists. They were on a crash course with each other, and crash into each other they surely did. But this dizzying display did not create a spell-binding spectacle to respect and admire in all awe. The scene that was created by these two fists going against each other was actually rather weird.

Wherever the black light was, it dissolved and broke. Wherever the white light was, the dissolved substances were reborn.

Two fists of opposing light struck each other, but there was no explosion. The scene that was created was even scarier than an explosion.

Human King’s face changed. He had consumed Qin Xiu’s body and soul. Although he had not finished combining, he was already invincible. Even Crape Myrtle, the leader of the universe, was not stronger than him. Amidst the two black and white colliding punches, Littleflower’s white fist and light were able to suppress the black fist light. Inch by inch, it went toward Human King. The white light area became bigger and bigger while the black light’s area became smaller and smaller.

Human King’s eyes shook. He could not believe Littleflower’s power had reached such a level.

“Impossible! He is just a mixed heir of some crystallizer. How could he have possibly managed to walk that step?” Upon seeing the suppressing white light inside the white light, it was like a new world. Human King’s heart was wrought with confusion. He could not grasp an answer.

Pang!

Human King’s body was shaken back as he was thrown away. Littleflower’s advance still went on.

Human King was shocked. The black crystal armor on his hand was a spirit. The black fist changed. It became a black and grey light.

The black and grey light beam could cut through anything. It cut open Littleflower’s white fist of light. It flashed past the zone of white light.

Littleflower was burning with white light. The black light cut it open, and the body was cut in half.

“You are strong, but no matter how strong you are, you are just my heir.” When Human King saw the body get cut in half, Littleflower’s body was falling in two different ways.

Ji Yanran was watching. She could not speak. When she saw it, she almost fainted and collapsed.

In the next second, she saw Littleflower’s body, which had been cut in half, get pulled back together by some strange power. It was recomposed into one being like he had never been hurt in the first place.

Littleflower moved his limbs. He calmly looked at Human King and said, “Let’s not say I do not know if you are the real Human Alpha, but even if you are, according to the universe’s evolution rules, the new generations are always stronger than the last. You should have been kicked away by now.”

Human King frowned. He could not completely combine with the geno prototype armor and Reboot-class power, but the damage earlier was the very first combination. Even Crape Myrtle wouldn’t use a god body to attack. If the god body was damaged, it would be hard to recover.

Littleflower’s body had been cut open by his universe powers, yet he could still heal. That surprised Human King a fair bit.

“Your family has never failed to surprise me,” Human King said to Littleflower as he looked at him. He still had a bit of a murderous look in his eyes. “If you guys hand over Bao’er now, I will pretend none of this ever happened. Then, I can make you a student of Blood Legion. In the future, you might be able to become Blood Legion’s leader.”

He thought Bao’er was the one he needed to get rid of, but he now knew that in the Han Sen family, Bao’er was not the only one who posed a threat to him.

Littleflower’s power was good enough to go against half the elites of the universe and make them all tremble.

“It does not matter if you are Blood Legion or not. I am not interested. I will tell you one more time, let go of my sister!” Littleflower’s fist blazed with a white flame once more.

“I gave you a chance,” Human King said. The black crystal armor around his hand turned into a spirit again. He threw a punch toward Littleflower. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Littleflower’s chest was punctured by the fist, but he immediately recovered. His steps to go to Human King did not stop.

Human King frowned. He punched Littleflower without stopping. No matter how Littleflower was injured, he recovered. Human King’s universe powers could not destroy Littleflower’s body. “What kind of power is this?” Human King’s eyes looked like blades. He stared at Littleflower, who was now looking like an angel. He clearly saw that the light shadow power could affect Littleflower’s body, but the universe’s power cut the angel light. It did not hurt the light though. It was like the light did not even exist. It looked incredibly weird.

With Human King’s power, even if the light shadow was a God Spirit, his universe powers should have been able to destroy it. It was like his power could affect the Super God Spirit mode of Han Ling’er.

But Littleflower’s angel light was not affected by him. Human King could not understand what that light shadow was.

Seeing Littleflower was already in front of him, the punch was now coming toward his face. Human King moved his eyes. His other hand lifted up Han Ling’er’s body to put her before Littleflower’s fist.
