1874 Gana’s Destruction

Han Sen carried Guna back to the ship and secured a spot for Meng’er.

Han Sen had thought Icebird Duke would be able to collect some Nobles during his absence, even if they were merely Barons. Things hadn’t turned out quite as he’d expected them to, though.

Too many factions were there with the desire to recruit the Gana. They all had the same idea that Han Sen did, too. Even if they could not recruit the Gana, no one wanted to return home empty-handed.

Many factions had tried securing the services of a Baron, and very few Barons would settle for the low aspirations of fledgling factions like Han Sen’s. They wanted big groups, and the big groups happily chose them. Even if they wanted to join the Rebate, it was far more likely they’d join the Gold Jade King instead.

Han Sen had been gone for a long time, but despite that, no Barons had been recruited.

Not long after, Dragon Lady brought Wang Yuhang along. The workers on the ship were very happy to see a Baron come to join them. But Dragon Lady requested that Wang Yuhang go along with her, and if not, she would not lend them her services.

If this was another planet at war, Barons couldn’t make such demands. But in these circumstances, if recruiters did not honor such requests, they wouldn’t have much success.

Han Sen made a speech that allowed them to stay. The workers complied, and the two were led on board.

“Icebird Duke, it is way too difficult to recruit people here. We should go to another planet.” Han Sen hid Guna in his room, and he didn’t fancy staying around any longer than he had to.

“Okay.” Icebird Duke knew this would happen. She had warned Han Sen before they even arrived. But instead of rubbing it in, she simply agreed with him.

When the ship started to fly off, many airships suddenly started to surround it. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Han Sen’s heart jumped in his chest, and he thought to himself, “Did something happen? Did they see me sneak Guna on-board? It looks like I can’t do bad things and expect to get away with it. I just want her help. It wasn’t as if I was going to harm her, though. Karma is biting me back pretty quickly...”

Han Sen kept fretting about potentially being exposed. And if this was the truth, he wondered how he might make it out alive.

Han Sen saw there were many Kao on the airship. So, Icebird Duke went out and spoke to their leader.

“Icebird Duke, what do they want?” Han Sen asked, after nervously waiting for her to return.

Icebird Duke gave Han Sen an invitation, and then she said, “I wasn’t expecting this, but the Gana are actually controlled by the Kao now. The Kao are looking to sell some. So, they have invited us to an auction.”

“Really? How did they manage that?” Han Sen now knew it wasn’t just Guna who had been captured. The whole of the Gana populace had likely become prisoners.

“Judging from the current situation, I am afraid only the Kao can accomplish this with the Gana. The other factions could not try, because they were watched. If they struck, others were sure to know,” Icebird Duke said.

Those Kao are conducting auctions? They really think that after the auction is complete, they can take the money they amassed and leave?” Han Sen lifted his lip.

“Maybe they have brain damage? Or maybe they’ve got a powerful backer? Regardless, this is none of our business. After all, you lack sufficient funds to take part in such an auction.” Icebird Duke knew the state of Han Sen’s finances.

Han Sen was practically broke. He hadn’t been producing enough xenogeneic materials and genes to sell. He had also been taking much of what they collected back to the sanctuary to feed his family and friends. Because of that, he had nothing for the auction.

“Maybe I should go, just so I can at least learn a thing or two?” Han Sen thought that if he left now, it would be too obvious.

If he was there for the Gana and didn’t even bother showing his face in an auction, his actions might be considered suspicious.

If the Gana had been defeated and were unable to protect themselves, no one would guess Guna was there, and so his secret would be safe. Han Sen thought he’d join the auction to at least keep himself from drawing suspicion.

Back in his room, Han Sen used hidden mode. He wouldn’t allow voices or videos to be sent outside his room. He also let Little Invisible jump off of Guna’s head.

The bed was colorful in the room, and that was where Guna appeared. Her body was cuffed to the bed, and her mouth was gagged. Only her tail could move.

“Let me go. If anyone finds out that I am here, you will be very dead.” Guna looked fairly angry.

“Let me give you the bad news and the good news. The bad news? Well, all of the Gana have become prisoners. And tomorrow, they’ll all be auctioned off! The good news? You don’t have to go to this auction and face slavery. You will become mine,” Han Sen said.

“No way. You can’t lie to me!” Guna’s eyes were open wide.

“No way? Then how did you end up captured by Gia?” Han Sen brought out his invitation and showed it to her.

She was tied up, but her tail was free. With it, she opened the invitation and stared at it with wide eyes that refused to shut.

Those traitors!” Guna looked even angrier.

You are lucky that you aren’t being sold off. Follow me and I will treat you well. I promise that you won’t face a slave’s treatment.” Han Sen smiled.

“What do you want from me?” Guna looked rather confused as she asked Han Sen.

“Nothing. I am only here to recruit. You should know the rules of the Rebate, though,” Han Sen said, seeming to switch subjects abruptly.

Guna looked at Han Sen and asked, “You are not a Rebate, though. You are an outsider, clearly. I think it is more than rare for an outsider to collect members for a faction. I think there are only a few who do this sort of thing. I don’t think you’re one of them.”

“Outdated news, lady. I am Knife Queen’s student. She’s the leader of the bunny bunch. Of course I have permission to recruit people here.” Han Sen smiled, and then went on to say, “When I boarded the ship, did you not see the Rebate around? Did you not see the respect and politeness they showed me?”

“Knife Queen has taken an outsider for a student?” Guna could hardly believe it.

“Believe it or not, it does not matter to me.” After that, Han Sen lay down on the bed next to her.

“What are you doing?” Guna was shocked, and she wished to avoid him. But she was tied up on the bed, and she was unable to move.

“What else would I do aside from sleeping?” Han Sen was lying on the bed, and he looked at Guna as he spoke.

“Don’t you dare. I would rather kill myself.” A shiver ran down Guna’s spine when her eyes met with Han Sen’s stare. She had heard a lot of races outside her own were quite... sick.

Han Sen smiled and grabbed her jaw.
