Chapter 3333 Lure

Han Sen ignored the purple copper sword. He used the Dongxuan Aura, wanting to find the native creatures the purple copper sword mentioned.

With his power, controlling a native and having them pick up his sword would not be difficult.

When the Dongxuan Aura was cast, Han Sen knew things were as simple as he thought they would be. The weapon forest around had a powerful presence. Every weapon had its own presence.

The Dongxuan Aura was weakened by all those presences. He had only been able to cast his presence out at a radius of around 10 miles. He could not send it out any further than that, and that was just his observation power. If he wanted to use his power to control the native creatures, he would have to be even closer to them wherever they were.

It seemed as if the purple copper sword could feel Han Sen’s Dongxuan Aura. He said, “Do not waste your energy. Let’s not say your power can even stretch beyond the weapon forest, but even if you could go past it, you cannot control the natives. The natives are protected by Soldier Weapon Sky. If you touch them, they will be restricted by the rules that govern Soldier Weapon Sky.”

When Han Sen heard that, he frowned. “Can I really not use power to control the natives? If that cannot be done, how can they pick us up?”

The purple copper sword wanted to say something, but only a sudden sigh was heard. Soon after, the sword body started to shake.

Han Sen felt it sooner than the purple copper sword did. It surprised Han Sen. About 500 miles away, there was seven- or eight-year-old wearing armor. She was traveling through the weapon forest.

“Is that a native of the 33 skies? Why is a human girl here?” Han Sen felt weird.

Before the 33 skies returned to origin, he had never seen a human shadow in the 33 skies. Now, he was seeing a little human girl. That gave him a bit of a shock.

If a human could survive there, it meant he should have been able to regain his human form. Unfortunately, he was still stuck as a jian.

The purple copper sword tried its best to shake his sword body. He released a very small humming sound. He was trying to lure the little girl over. Han Sen’s heart jumped. He immediately used the Dongxuan Aura on the little girl. He was trying to draw the little girl closer.

Pang!

The moment the Dongxuan Aura touched the little girl, Han Sen felt as if his body was given an electric shock. The Dongxuan Aura suddenly broke. His body was shaking like a loon. If he had a mouth, he would be screaming in pain.

The purple copper sword was very happy. “Ha! Ha! I told you a long time ago. This is the consequence of not listening to your elders. Now you understand its power.”

Han Sen was not annoyed. He coldly asked, “So, you did the same thing, too? Otherwise, how would you know what it is like?”

The purple copper sword grunted and did not speak. He kept using the sword to make a humming sound to draw the attention of the little girl.

Han Sen knew what the purple copper sword was trying to do, but he did not learn how to shake his body. He decided to just sit and watch.

“Why are you frozen there?” the purple copper sword asked Han Sen as he kept shaking his sword self. “Should you not be trying to make more noise, generate attention, and garner her interest in coming over here?”

“Is it not enough that you draw her over here?” Han Sen asked.

The purple copper sword heard that and got mad. “Make more noise! There will be a higher chance of attracting her this way. If you are not going to make an effort, do not try to fight me later.”

“Why would I try and fight you?” Han Sen asked with a smile. “If you decide to come my way, I can tell you that it will not be my fault.”

“You mother... You won’t put any effort in, yet you are still planning on reaping all the benefits,” the purple copper sword said. “How can there be something so good in this world? Not even I would do something like that.” He stopped shaking his sword self.

“Whatever.” Han Sen looked as if he did not care.

The purple copper sword coldly grunted and stopped talking. The little girl seemed to have heard the sound of the purple copper sword earlier. She was walking in their direction.

When the purple copper sword stopped, the little girl lost her direction and started walking far away. She was walking further and further away.

“I can tell you that there are not many natives around,” the purple copper sword said with worry. “You might not see another for at least half a month. If you miss out on this chance, who knows how much longer you might have to wait. You need to think about it.”

Han Sen did not speak. He only used the Dongxuan Aura to look at the little girl. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Seeing Han Sen not talk, the purple copper sword said, “Work with me and attract the little girl. That way, we all have rewards to reap. If you are only here for freebies, I am not going to do anything that might benefit you.”

“I will still say the same thing,” Han Sen replied. “It is all up to you.”

The purple copper sword was very angry. He was shaking. Upon seeing the little girl walk further and further away, Han Sen was continuing to not do anything. The purple copper sword gnashed his teeth and said, “I will lure her here. Do not dare try and fight me for her.”

Before Han Sen said anything, he tried his best to shake his sword body. He made some moaning sword-like sounds. He was afraid the girl would walk too far away and no longer hear the moaning call.

Fortunately, the girl had not walked too far away. After hearing the sound of the moaning sword, she listened to it for a while. She decided to follow the acoustic’s direction.

Not long later, the little girl came before Han Sen and the purple copper sword. Her big eyes drifted around. She was trying to find out where the sword moaning sound had come from.

“You just sit and wait,” the purple copper sword said as he kept shaking his sword body. “When I have recovered my power, I will be able to help you.”

Han Sen ignored him. He started shaking his body too. He also generated some moaning sounds.

Hearing the moaning sounds, the little girl turned to look at Han Sen. She looked shocked. It seemed as if she had no idea which way to go first.

“You... obscene...” The purple copper sword was exhibiting an aura of anger. The sword moaning became louder.

“You are not bad,” Han Sen said. “If I have guessed things correctly, the natives cannot just randomly take a weapon. You are in so much of a rush, so I assume the natives can only take one weapon at a time.”

“What is this nonsense you are talking about?” The purple copper sword paused and said, “I don’t know anything about that.”

When Han Sen saw his reaction to that, he knew he was correct.

“If it isn’t that way, then it does not matter which one of us is pulled out first. If I get pulled out, I will come back and help you.” Han Sen kept shaking his jian body to make a loud noise.

“I attracted her first. You should let me be pulled out first.” The purple copper sword tried its best. The cries of the sword became louder.

“That all depends on which of us she likes more. If she does not like you, you cannot force her.” Han Sen tried harder.

Han Sen was very strong. The purple copper sword had already enticed the little girl and wasted so much effort to do so, yet the black jian’s voice was able to shroud and cover up the purple copper sword.

The little girl was attracted by the loud jian noise. She started walking over to Han Sen. The purple copper sword roared and yelled, “I am going to fight you!”

A sword moan exploded again to cover Han Sen’s jian. Han Sen was not weak either. He increased the volume of his moaning jian.

“Argh!” The two of them fought. It resulted in the girl screaming. She held her ears, looking as if she was in pain. She turned around and left.

“No... Don’t go...” Han Sen and the purple copper sword screamed at the same time, but the girl could not hear them.
