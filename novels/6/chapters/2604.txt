Chapter 2605 Swap

The meeting ended quickly. The story of Han Sen making a butterfly in the palms of his hands spread across all of Sky Palace. The Sky Palace students were delighted by the result.

When they were alone, Bixi and Exquisite discussed what had happened. Bixi frowned and asked her, “You want to make Han Sen your silkworm?”

Exquisite nodded and said, “If Lone Bamboo isn’t willing to join the Very High, there is no point in forcing him to. I should use this opportunity to take Han Sen with me.”

Bixi frowned even more. “Have you thought this through? Han Sen looks very talented, but I don’t think things are as simple as they seem with him. Perhaps he has practiced a special and unique geno art that allowed him to access and activate the God Spirit Touch’s gene potential and make the God Spirit Touch become deified. That might have been why he was able to make the butterfly and create the illusion of having an eleven armor talent. Perhaps that isn’t his true talent. You should know that crystallizers can’t have a gene talent that high.”

Exquisite sighed and said, “It is impossible. Eleven armor talents exist only in legends. Han Sen isn’t bad, but I know he can’t reach those mythical heights. But still, there must be a reason for what transpired. In addition, I have seen for myself that Han Sen is talented. And the geno art he uses can make other creatures evolve. And that is impressive on its own. This power he has is very rare. Even if his talent was ordinary, I would be willing to make him my silkworm so I could study that geno art of his. Plus, there is the chance he still has excellent talent.”

Upon hearing this, Bixi didn’t deny the possibility. He said, “You are right. That power is so mysterious. Even our race doesn’t have a geno art that could accomplish what Han Sen had done. That miraculous geno art is more than enough reason for you to take him on as your silkworm.”

“Since you agree, can you please bring this subject up for discussion when we talk to Sky Palace tomorrow?” Exquisite said.

Bixi nodded and said, “But before that, I need to go and test Han Sen. I need to see his true power.”

Exquisite didn’t object to this. There were many stories surrounding Han Sen, but she had never witnessed his abilities directly. She wouldn’t place her faith in Han Sen’s skills until she saw them first hand.

“Han Sen’s wounds have yet to heal. I don’t think we should fight him. But if we don’t, how else should we test him?” Exquisite asked.

“I have a way,” Bixi said without explaining.

Han Sen returned to his little jade island to heal. Fortunately, the leader of Sky Palace forbade others from entering the island and disturbing him. If people had been allowed to go and see him after what had just happened, he wouldn’t have had a single second of reprieve.

Han Sen had used his hands to produce a butterfly. That boosted Han Sen’s reputation to a whole new level. Although Han Sen wasn’t related to the people of Sky Palace by blood, his reputation was one of the best of that whole generation. He was on par with Yu Shanxin and Lone Bamboo.

When the story of Han Sen using his hands to produce a butterfly reached Narrow Moon, many of the Rebate stunned at the news.

Some of the Rebate hadn’t liked it when Yisha decided to move Narrow Moon, but now they were starting to change their minds. They didn’t hate the concept of moving anymore.

“Han Sen is Knife Queen’s only student. Knife Queen offended the Extreme King on his behalf and moved Narrow Moon next to Sky Palace. So, Han Sen is with us. In the future, Han Sen will work for the Rebate. He will bless us. Perhaps we will have a chance to rise as well.” Many of the Rebate were thinking along these lines.

After all this happened, a lot of the pressure that the Rebate had been putting on Yisha abruptly fell away. The Kings that had always been against her had changed their minds. They kept mentioning the idea of bringing Han Sen over to bless them.

Yisha pretended not to hear those constant whisperings. She had seen Han Sen’s blessing, and she knew it was something amazing. But Yisha didn’t think that power could turn a dumpster fire into a deified.

From what Yisha had seen, the people that were blessed by Han Sen were already quite close to becoming deified. For someone who already didn’t have a chance of becoming deified, it wouldn’t make a difference no matter how many blessings were bestowed.

Yisha knew that Han Sen wouldn’t turn her down if she made a request, so she didn’t ask just yet.

It wasn’t like she was too full of pride to ask for the help of her student; there was simply no one in the Rebate that was suitable for the blessing.

The Rebate were considered a higher race, but their ranking was still low on that generous leaderboard. They had depended on the support of the Jade Toad and the Extreme King to become a higher race. Now that she was deified, she was the biggest supporter the Rebate had.

She was the only being of her level within the Rebate. The only Rebate close to being deified was Moon Wheel King, but he was old, and his lifespan had almost reached its end. It was unknown if he could become a deified after receiving a blessing. Even if he did, though, he wouldn’t live long enough to do much for the Rebate.

Yisha couldn’t stop thinking about the fact that the Rebate had no one special like Lando or Barr. It was giving her a headache. As Yisha continued working, Bao’er ran into the hall and leaped into her chest.

“Big Sister Queen!”

“Bao’er, why are you here?” Yisha stroked Bao’er’s head and smiled.

Bao’er used to live in the palace with Yisha. Yisha had liked her a lot and spoiled her quite a bit.

“Daddy brought me here,” Bao’er said with a smile.Yisha looked ahead and saw Han Sen being led forward by a Rebate guard. He was brought into the hall. She told the guard straight away, “Let him in!”

“My Queen,” Han Sen said with a bow.

Yisha looked at Han Sen and observed how weak and frail his body had become. She said, “Why aren’t you resting on the little jade island? You shouldn’t be running around in this shape.”

Han Sen knew Yisha was referring to the fact that he had just blessed the God Spirit Touch. He smiled and said, “I was just going to listen to the Very High explain geno arts. I was pushed to the stage to do something against my will.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

After that, Han Sen went on to say, “My body hasn’t recovered yet. It will probably take a whole year. Maybe my Queen can pick two or three people from the Rebate for me, and I will find the time to bless them. It will help you all. If they aren’t talented enough to become deified, they can still be made considerably stronger.”

Yisha was very pleased. Han Sen had mentioned this without being asked to. She believed she had made the right decision.

“It is a shame there are no psychics here that can calculate the location of people. It is impossible to find Dollar now,” Yisha thought to herself. She still hadn’t let her grudge against Dollar go.

She wasn’t really looking for Dollar because of her grudge, though. Yisha wanted to get the Rebate alpha’s scabbard back.
