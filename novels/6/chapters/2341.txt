Chapter 2342 Kingese Blowing Up the Body

During the process of becoming a Duke, Han Sen’s Ghost Bone Power was wholly refined. Not a single drop of it remained. And that was just to bring him up to Duke level. The Story of Genes had to be fed a scary amount of power for ascension.

The Kingese symbols continued to fall, and it kept pushing The Story of Genes to run full throttle.

Quickly, The Story of Genes was opening its very first gene lock. But somehow, even though The Story of Genes was powerful, it was missing that last little push to open the gene lock. The Story of Genes continued to grow stronger and stronger.

Han Sen looked ill. His body was doing pretty poorly right now. The Kingese forced The Story of Genes to flood his interior with power, but all that surging strength had nowhere to go. The gene lock was still tightly shut, sealing in the power. It was like a river was dammed, and the water couldn’t go anywhere. Sooner or later, the dam was bound to buckle and collapse, resulting in the water bursting everywhere.

Han Sen’s body was this dam. If the water broke through, then Han Sen’s body would be destroyed. How could he be happy about that?

“Oh no! The gene lock. Surely the gene lock doesn’t have to be opened by Duke genes, right?” Under the force of The Story of Genes, Han Sen was unable to break the gene lock. And he had also just realized why. His body was different from the average person or creature of the geno universe. One hundred Duke genes could open one geno lock, but now, with so much power going into him, he didn’t have what it took to break the same lock. That had to be why.

Although he couldn’t confirm his guess, the power of the Kingese was becoming stronger. Even his Original Water King Body couldn’t hold it.

The body was like water, thrashing around like mad. It was like there was some power disturbing it, with no rhyme or reason. It created a small swirl.

Luckily, this was the Original Water King Body’s body he had. His body could heal quickly. If he was a normal king, the power being sent his way would have already ripped him apart at the seams.

Even though the Original Water King Body had great regenerative properties, it had absorbed too much Kingese. He himself was now shining gold. The water appeared bloated, and the water body was a few times bigger than it had been before. It became a giant, gold orb of water.

The more Kingese that fell, the bigger the orb of water became. It was going to pop any second.

There weren’t many Kingese left to fall, and Han Sen gritted his teeth, trying to withstand it. His body felt absolutely terrible. He was going to blow up. A countless number of Kingese symbols were inside his body.

Fortunately, he hadn’t blown up yet.

When the last Kingese landed on Han Sen, he sighed.

But the next second, Han Sen’s face looked utterly terrible. All the Kingese symbols inside him were rioting through his body. The scary power broke Han Sen’s body, and he didn’t even have a chance to fight back.

Bai Ling Shuang looked at Han Sen with a complicated stare. And suddenly, the orb of water Han Sen had become, exploded. He burst into a hanging mist. He was shining like a gold diamond.

Each drop had gold Kingese spinning inside it. It was a stange sight.

After a while, the light of the Kingese dimmed. The mist flowed back together to reform the shape of that water man. Then Han Sen’s face became visible.

Han Sen was so happy. Luckily, the Original Water King Body had allowed him to gather himself up again. No matter how strong another king body was, being blown up like that would have rendered them very dead.

The water body became flesh, revealing Han Sen with a pale face. The Original Water King Body could recompose the general structure of a body, but he was still damaged and in quite a bit of pain.

“Brother Seventeen, it looks like I win,” Han Sen said, turning to Bai Qing Xia.

Bai Qing Xia looked back and coldly said, “I understand now how a genius like you could claim the alpha statue. You really are quite special. I have indeed lost.”

Han Sen took two steps away, with the intent of getting out of that place. But even in those short steps, he almost fell over. He felt so weak that he could barely stand.

Han Sen waved to his blood kirin, and the blood kirin moved quickly over to his side. Han Sen pulled himself onto the creature’s back so it could take him out of King’s Garden.

Prince Sixteen Bai Yi had triggered the Kingese to fall like stars. The news of this event was sent to every far corner of King’s Kingdom in a short amount of time.

Bai Yi once had a really bad reputation, but now he was sounding much better.

Han Sen made an excuse to go back and hide on Planet Water Zone, claiming he had been terribly injured by the Kingese. He wanted to be left alone, but even so, many people came to visit him.

One of his visitors was a deified water elite sent by King Bai himself. She claimed she had come there to heal Han Sen, but it was actually because King Bai was suspicious of Han Sen. He wanted the elite to examine Han Sen’s body, top to bottom.

After all, Bai Yi wasn’t very talented. And he had suddenly claimed the alpha statue and triggered the unbelievable events beneath the king tree. King Bai had grown very suspicious of him, and that was why he asked the water deified to go and heal Han Sen. He wanted Han Sen’s body to be examined to confirm that it was really Prince Sixteen Bai Yi.

“Captain Water Moon, how is Yi’er doing?” King Bai asked tonelessly.

Captain Water Moon answered, “Prince Sixteen isn’t doing well. His body is full of that Kingese power. It is everywhere. He cannot use his Original Water King Body or any of his other powers like usual. I couldn’t find a way to fix it, either.”

“Can’t his Original Water King Body separate and process the Kingese power?” King Bai frowned.

Captain Water Moon explained gravely, “If this was a normal body, Prince Sixteen would have died when his body first exploded. His Original Water King Body is the only reason he survived. But that is also the reason the Kingese power has invaded his original water substance. It will be impossible to separate the two. It cannot be done by an external force. To clear the Kingese inside the water, you would have to break the water. That would also mean killing Prince Sixteen.”

“Is there no other way?” King Bai asked, while looking at Captain Water Moon.

“I am useless in this matter.” Captain Water Moon shook her head.

Not long after Captain Water Moon left, Miss Mirror came into King Bai’s study.

“Little Sister, check out Sixteen and give me an answer quickly,” King Bai said to Miss Mirror as soon as she entered.

Miss Mirror looked at King Bai and asked, “You think there is a problem with Bai Yi?”

“As a father, I hope he really is this good, but...” before King Bai finished, he waved his hand. “Go. Get me an answer quickly, and forbid Bai Yi from leaving King’s Kingdom in the meantime.”

“Yes.” Miss Mirror bowed and departed the study. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Han Sen,” Miss Mirror murmured after she left the study. A very creepy smile crossed her face.
