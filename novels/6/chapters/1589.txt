Chapter 1590: He Is Still Alive

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Zuo Lan did not know who Second Uncle was, but she heard Han Sen and Ning Yue. And with Yu Hetian’s facial expression being what it was, some things finally clicked into place.

“Han Sen... no, wait. The first super aristocrat of the Alliance? Is he Xie Qing King?” Zuo Lan looked at Han Sen with a confused expression, her mind now a mess of different thoughts.

Zuo Lan thought if he actually was Han Sen, with his identity being what it was, he wouldn’t be the sort to allow someone else to be the manager of his work. Overbearing President Love Luv Looove! had to be his creation. He didn’t want others to know that, and that is why he must have donned the guise of a manager.

Realizing that Xie Qing King might have been Han Sen, Zuo Lan felt as if her heart was going to blow up inside her chest.

For such a powerful person to have such unbridled creativity was an incredible thing.

If Han Sen knew what she was thinking at that moment, he’d be having a cold sweat. That was because he had no artistic talent, and he wasn’t even all that interested in Xie Qing King’s comics, either.

“Second Uncle? Who is Second Uncle?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He could guess who he might have been referring to, but he couldn’t quite believe it.

“Second Brother Ning. Second Uncle told me to say this name and you’ll know,” Ning Yue calmly said.

Yu Hetian heard Second Brother Ning and felt his heart begin to cramp. His face was turning black with cold sweat.

The last person who mentioned that name in front of Han Sen was a demi-god. He then became a fertilizer in the garden.

“When?” Han Sen wanted to confirm that the Second Uncle in the Ning family was like Gu Qingcheng and hadn’t made a wish before the elusive God.

Han Sen did not know why the man wished to meet with him, but Han Sen himself had many questions he wanted to ask. So, he decided to take the man up on his offer.

“If you have the time, I will allow Director Yu to bring you here,” Ning Yue said.

“Okay.” Han Sen nodded.

“Director Yu... Director Yu!” Ning Yue had to call him a few times before he snapped back to reality.

“Yes... yes? Is there something you require?” Yu Hetian quickly asked.

“Take our guest to meet with the Second Uncle. I do not want him to be made upset again,” Ning Yue said coldly.

“Yes. Do not worry! I will deliver our guest safely to meet with the Second Uncle. I’ll make sure he is satisfied.” While Yu Hetian spoke, a pained look appeared on his face.

“Han Sen... no... Demi-God Han... This is my fault. Please, let me live!” Although Yu Hetian did not want to apologize, he did. The thought of being wedged between two individuals like Han Sen and Second Uncle made all his anger disappear and replaced it with fear.

Seeing Yu Hetian talking like this, Wei Mingzhen was taken aback.

“What are you looking at? Apologize to Demi-God Han.” Seeing Wei Mingzhen’s face made him angry again. If it wasn’t for her desire to create the adaptation, none of this would have happened in the first place. He slapped her in the face.

Zuo Lan felt immense joy watching that. She’d had enough of these people, and she had only slogged through it for the benefit of Impression Culture.

“It is no wonder he is a super aristocrat. Even the Ning family of Starry Group treats him with such respect. And the fact that he can also draw such amazing comics makes him the most perfect man. It is a shame he is married. Why are all the good men already taken?” Zuo Lan was thinking.

Han Sen didn’t do anything to Yu Hetian. After all, Yu Hetian was one of the Ning family’s people. Han Sen would let them deal with him however they saw fit. After all, he still didn’t know if the Ning family were friends or enemies. He didn’t want to cross any unspoken lines.

Yu Hetian then took Han Sen to the planet where Second Uncle lived. He didn’t even land his ship. He told Han Sen that Second Uncle wasn’t fond of visitors, so he just left as soon as he’d dropped off the guest he was tasked to deliver. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ning Yue was waiting for Han Sen at the spaceport. He used an older ship to take Han Sen across the planet.

The planet looked very primal. It was like a prehistoric forest. There were many creatures there, and the place hadn’t seen any development.

When the ship came to a stop, Ning Yue walked ahead to lead Han Sen. It was just one big forest, and there were no paths.

“Second Uncle is not fond of technology. He doesn’t want such things anywhere near him. He doesn’t really care about the family business, either. He has remained hidden for decades. I am surprised he wanted to meet with you, specifically,” Ning Yue said to Han Sen as if he was talking to an old friend. You could not tell that Han Sen had once hurt him, and he had to be alone for years.

“Maybe it is because of the old man’s business?” Han Sen really admired Ning Yue. Even though he was an enemy, it didn’t hinder Han Sen’s admiration of him.

Han Sen thought if he was in Ning Yue’s shoes, he couldn’t have done the same.

Ning Yue now looked very tame. He was a hard man to decipher, and not even Han Sen would underestimate him.

On the way, Ning Yue begged something of Han Sen. He told Han Sen that the Ning family had two people he could not offend. One was Second Uncle and the other was Ning Yue himself.

The grumpy one, the Son of God, was not mentioned. There wouldn’t be a problem there.

Grass was everywhere and so were flowers. Han Sen saw a slope with a few wooden houses perched upon it. The walls of the constructs were built from branches. They all appeared to be handmade, and while it was not entirely pretty, it gave Han Sen a feeling of rustic comfort.

“Second Uncle, Han Sen is here,” Ning Yue said from outside one of the houses.

The wooden door was open, and a middle-aged man came walking through the doorframe. He looked similar to Ning Yue. He looked like a gentle person, but when he rolled up his sleeves, you could see that he was holding a hoe. He was also wearing flip-flops. It was a strange combination.

“Come in. No one else is here, so make yourself at home.” Second Uncle was very polite to Han Sen, but it made Han Sen feel as if he had encountered a fake Second Uncle.

From the way Yu Hetian reacted, you’d assume Second Uncle was a devil that loved to murder people.

“Why did you ask me to come here?” Han Sen asked with a bow.

Second Uncle was from the same time period as Han Jinzhi. If they were friends, Han Sen would not be against calling him Second Uncle.

Second Uncle looked at Han Sen and said, “You’ve never seen Han Jinzhi?”

They were just words, but they made Han Sen’s heart jump. They made his face change.

“Is he still alive?” Han Sen asked, while looking at Second Uncle.
