Chapter 2094 Night Ghost Battle

“Please give me a hand taking down this *sshole! He is the one that slew my workers, and many Night Ghosts as well,” Kahn called out when he saw Han Sen and the others coming. He looked joyous in relief.

“We have finally found it!” Sleepless Duke shouted happily as she ran to join the fight. “Please help us.”

Han Sen and Lone Bamboo looked at each other, then moved forward to help.

The man glowed blue as he fought. He looked injured, but he was still more than a match for Kahn, who was a Marquise Demon. The man was impressive.

When the three of them join Kahn, the fight became a four-on-one. That imbalance of power should have ended the fight immediately, but although they managed to suppress the man, they were unable to kill him.

Han Sen could confirm right away that the man was a member of Blood Legion. He was very much like God’s Retribution, and the presence he had was something only members of Blood Legion tended to carry.

The man roared like a beast. His fist punched the knife out of Kahn’s hand. And then, another fist came to knock Sleepless Duke’s claws away. He could fight two people at once, and that meant he was really strong.

Kahn used Sky Demon powers, and even so, the man was able to shrug off the attacks that came crashing against his body. Sleepless Duke was a Night Ghost Duke, but not even she was able to claim an advantage over that man.

As the man used his fists to attack Kahn and Sleepless Duke, Lone Bamboo’s sword swept toward the man’s chest. He shouldn’t have been able to block Lone Bamboo’s simple, albeit powerful attack.

The man exploded with blue light, though. He stumbled back a bit, losing his balance. It also meant he dodged Lone Bamboo’s sword.

But Han Sen, who had silently moved behind the man, went at the man’s throat with Ghost Teeth Knife.

Kahn and Sleepless Duke rushed forward, with knives and claws respectively, to attack the man.

Dong!

There was a loud noise, as Han Sen grabbed the man and threw him at Lone Bamboo. He had to use his own knife to repel Kahn and Sleepless Duke’s incoming strikes, though.

Han Sen’s legs dug a pair of trenches into the ground as he was knocked back ten meters. But now, Lone Bamboo’s sword was at the man’s throat’ not letting him move.

“Han Sen, what are you doing? He killed so many of our people; he should die!” Sleepless Duke looked incredibly angry. She flared up with a black, demonic fire. With her claws, she came in to attack the man.

Han Sen flapped his dragon wings and teleported in front of her. He used Tooth for a Tooth, slashing across her claw air to deflect her strike.

Han Sen’s body fell back, and Sleepless Duke flapped her wings. She looked like a demon as she screeched, “Han Sen! Is it because you are of the same race that you protect him? Our people cannot die in vain. No matter what!”

“Yes. Our workers cannot have died in vain, either. He must pay.” Kahn threw a slash towards the man in Lone Bamboo’s grip.

“Lone Bamboo, keep him alive.” Han Sen lifted Ghost Teeth Knife and sprang toward Sleepless Duke. He was pushed back.

Sleepless Duke was much stronger than Han Sen, and Han Sen knew he couldn’t beat her in a direct fight.

Lone Bamboo’s sword was still at the man’s throat. He ignored the knife Kahn was using and raised a finger to point at Kahn. A swordlight swiftly shot toward the dead center of Kahn’s forehead.

Lone Bamboo could not dodge the Sky Demon power that never missed. If Kahn attacked that way, Lone Bamboo was sure to be hit. But also, Kahn’s head would get perforated at the same time.

Kahn frowned and changed his skill. He fought Lone Bamboo with his knife.

But no one had an advantage. Kahn couldn’t commit to an attack without leaving an opening that Lone Bamboo could exploit. So, he had to change up the techniques he employed.

“You are Han Sen?” The man under Lone Bamboo’s sword did not look scared. He watched Han Sen fight Sleepless Duke. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Han Sen was weaker than she was, but he had speed and Break Space Flash. He could stop her from going after Lone Bamboo anytime he needed to.

“I am,” Han Sen answered.

The man immediately said, “God’s Retribution has spoken much about you. You should know about where I come from.”

“Spill the beans,” Han Sen snapped. This was the last confirmation he needed that the man was from Blood Legion.

“I don’t know what happened. When I was badly injured, the Taurus brought me here. I had some power, so I broke out. But I was stuck in that warehouse. I do not know what they are saying or what has supposedly transpired, but I haven’t left this place since they brought me here,” the man said.

“Nonsense! Do you believe him, Lone Bamboo? Are the deaths of our many Night Ghosts all a fabrication? Are the deaths of the Taurus all faked, too?” Sleepless Duke shouted. Her attempts to attack the man never paused.

Han Sen slashed towards Sleepless Duke to stop her from moving. He coldly said, “Sleepless Duke, I assure you that he has never been to Night Ring 12th Street. He was never placed in your captivity. You are lying!”

“What makes you so sure? You are merely protecting your kind,” Sleepless Duke screamed, then threw another claw air at Han Sen like she was hurling a net.

Han Sen flapped his dragon wings and disappeared. He re-appeared next to Sleepless Duke and coldly said, “Brother Lone Bamboo, take him away.”

Yes,” Lone Bamboo agreed. He began pulling the man back, still fighting Kahn as he went.

Seeing Lone Bamboo dragging the man away, with Kahn unable to stop him, Sleepless Duke screamed in rage. It was so loud that it reverberated from every corner of the base.

“None of you can leave!” Sleepless Duke screamed at ear-shattering volume.

“Sleepless Duke, do you know what you are doing?” Lone Bamboo ground out.

“Of course I know what I am doing. The Night Ghosts have been imprisoned by the Sky for many years. We will no longer obey you!” Sleepless Duke screamed.

Many shadows were gathering in the sky. They were like black clouds, and they were all Night Ghosts.

The Night Ghosts that appeared in the sky were different from the usual ones, however. They looked murderous, and the scariest thing about them was the fact that they were mostly Marquise. And many of them were Dukes, too.

Lone Bamboo frowned. The Night Ghosts were only supposed to have one Duke, and that was Sleepless Duke. If they now had so many, it meant that they must have all been eating living creatures to level up quickly.
