Chapter 2601 Han Sen’s Test

“Why is this process so familiar? Why do I feel like this is the same concept as the crystallizer glasses?” Han Sen looked at the God Spirit Touch on the table, deep in thought.

The people of Sky Palace were observing the God Spirit Touch. They didn’t believe the God Spirit Touch could reveal such amazing information.

If their future was able to be decided by an insect, then what was the point of continued practice?

“It’s just a bug. How can it decide our fate?” Thousand Feather Crane asked in annoyance. He was speaking aloud what everyone else in Sky Palace was thinking.

Bixi looked as cold as he always did. He looked at Thousand Feather Crane and said, “Although it is not 100% accurate, its margin for error is small. If you people don’t believe me, you are welcome to give it a try.”

“How do we give it a try?” Thousand Feather Crane asked, looking at the coin-sized God Spirit Touch ladybug.

Bixi didn’t speak. He reached his hand out to tap the God Spirit Touch. The God Spirit Touch’s body shivered. Then, it climbed back into the bug shells it had previously shed. Layer by layer, it pulled itself back into the bug shells to recompose itself. They fit around it without a single seam showing.

If they hadn’t witnessed that, the crowd would never have suspected that the bug had nine layers of the shell to shed.

Now, Bixi said, “Give him a drop of your blood. It will eat your blood and start removing its shells per the genes within your blood.”

Thousand Feather Crane didn’t hesitate. He put out his finger and squeezed out a droplet of blood. He allowed the God Spirit Touch ladybug to swallow the droplet of blood.

But this time, the ladybug only shed seven layers of its shell. Then, it stopped moving. It looked exhausted again.

“Seven armor talent. Not bad. If your luck doesn’t work against you, you can become deified and even reach the rank of transmutation,” Bixi said, looking intently at the God Spirit Touch. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I just say this bug has gotten tired, and that is why he stopped moving after taking off seven layers of its shell,” Yun Suyi said with a slight sneer.

All of the Sky Palace students agreed. They all doubted the truthfulness of the God Spirit Touch’s ability.

“Third Sister, why don’t you show us?” Bixi said, looking at Exquisite. Exquisite nodded. She used her finger to touch the head of the God Spirit Touch. The God Spirit Touch put on its layers of shell again. Exquisite fed it a droplet of her blood. As everyone watched, the bug started to shed its layers of armor again. It removed nine layers of the shell.

“If you guys still don’t believe us, you are welcome to try it yourselves. The genes of the Sky are quite good when compared to most of the higher races. A five-rank gene talent is most common, but it isn’t hard to get seven or eight. Nine is very rare, though. Right now, in the Sky, we have only been able to confirm that Lone Bamboo and Yu Shanxi have a nine armor talent,” Bixi said.

People still didn’t believe it, and Yun Suyi suddenly said, “It is easy to tell if this bug is accurate.”

“Please enlighten us,” Bixi said while looking at Yun Suyi.

The Sky Palace students all looked at Yun Suyi, as well. Yun Suyi looked at Bixi and confidently said, “You said Lone Bamboo had a nine armor talent, right?”

“That is correct,” Bixi answered with certainty.

“Then it is easy,” Yun Suyi said with a laugh. She looked at Han Sen and said, “If Lone Bamboo has a nine armor talent, then I present to you Brother Han, who has the same skill as Lone Bamboo. I think he is as talented as Lone Bamboo. Would you not agree?”

“Right, right; Brother Han and Lone Bamboo are similar. Perhaps we should allow Brother Han to give it a try.” The Sky Palace students were all in agreement.

Han Sen’s reputation in Sky Palace was as solid as Lone Bamboo’s, and he had done so much outside of Sky Palace to exceed everyone’s expectations of him. He had even taken down the Extreme King’s Fourth Uncle. If the bug said Han Sen wasn’t talented, they wouldn’t believe in the insect’s accuracy.

“Maybe not.” Bixi looked at Han Sen and coldly said, “The gene talents of the crystallizers have flaws in them. They are only advanced in their intelligence. They don’t exceed others in any capacity. Most of their race is like that. Even a few of the mutated ones aren’t much different; they might gain one or two additional shells. Having three more is incredibly rare.”

“Having three more shells is great. If normal crystallizers have a six armor talent, then it isn’t outlandish to believe Brother Han might have a nine armor talent,” Yun Suyi said. “The Sky are a high race. Ordinary people of the Sky have a five armor talent. The crystallizers are not a high race. Ordinary crystallizers only have three or four armor talents. My race has seen many crystallizers and tested them with the God Spirit Touch. Four armor talents are very rare, and I have never seen one with a five armor talent,” Bixi said levelly.

“If Brother Han cannot test and display a nine armor talent, then it proves the God Spirit Touch isn’t accurate,” Yun Suyi surely said.

“I agree. Brother Han’s skill, if he doesn’t get a nine armor talent, that means the bug is faulty.”

“Yes. Yes. If Brother Han doesn’t have a nine armor talent, then further testing is unnecessary. Even if he has a nine armor talent, it is useless. We cannot reach Brother Han’s achievement. That means the results from this thing are pointless.”All of the Sky Palace students were excited. Some of them weren’t actually suspicious of the God Spirit Touch, but this was about Lone Bamboo. Bixi and the others had made them mad. The Sky Palace students weren’t fond of Bixi and Exquisite, and that was why they were so excited.

“I cannot tell you if it is real or not. We will have to find out through further testing.” Bixi remained emotionless. It was like his face was wearing a mask that never moved.

Han Sen didn’t want to participate in such a test. It was none of his business, but the Sky Palace students were begging him to. So, he stood up and walked next to Bixi.

Bixi didn’t say much. He pressed the God Spirit Touch’s head to have it scurry around, collecting all of its shells. Then, he told Han Sen, “It’s ready.”

“The genes of humans aren’t stable, and even the crystallizer glasses weren’t able to tell me anything. I wonder if this God Spirit Touch can do what the glasses couldn’t,” Han Sen thought to himself. Then, he squeezed out some blood from his finger and held it in front of the God Spirit Touch.

The God Spirit Touch sucked Han Sen’s finger, pulling Han Sen’s blood into its belly.

The people of Sky Palace observed the God Spirit Touch nervously. Bixi and Exquisite watched the God Spirit Touch, as well. They were interested to see how much armor talent he had.

As everyone watched, the God Spirit Touch’s body shivered. It twitched slowly as it processed the blood it had taken in.
