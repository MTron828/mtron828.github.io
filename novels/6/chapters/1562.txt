Chapter 1563: Blade and Baton

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Yu was trying to resist the attacks of the crystal thorns, and he kept slashing the crystal cactus with his blade. He struck the crystal cactus easily every time. He had already covered the entire surface of the cactus in blows, yet he left nothing more than white scratch marks on its surface.

Han Sen shook his head. “The best aspect of Falsified Sky power is that it hits its target every time, and it can even bypass the defenses and deal damage inside the body. In this case, however, Luo Yu doesn’t have enough power to damage the body of the crystal cactus. Even though he can hit it, he won’t be able to break it.”

Luo Hui and Jia Shidao were terrified to see that Luo Yu couldn’t break the cactus.

Luo Yu fought the crystal cactus, yet he couldn’t do any harm to the crystal cactus, while the crystal cactus couldn’t hurt him either. Luo Yu fought for a while, then he suddenly retreated, leaving the attack range of the crystal cactus.

“Its body is too sturdy. Luo Hui, you’re our only chance now,” said Luo Yu, looking at Luo Hui.

“Perhaps my geno core Truth Spear can hurt it, but I don’t have a geno core armor, so I can’t approach him,” said Luo Hui. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Unlike Luo Yu, Luo Hui’s first self geno core was a spear, and it was an incredibly destructive, super level core.

“Don’t worry. I’ll ward off the crystal thorns for you, and you can kill it,” said Luo Yu.

“Okay.” Luo Hui nodded.

They rushed forward, and Luo Yu defended them against the thorns while Luo Hui moved toward the nearest crystal cactus.

Luo Hui immediately summoned a shining spear that was made from golden crystal. It pierced the crystal cactus, and half the tip went in.

“We can definitely kill it easily!” Luo Yu was exhilarated. He and Luo Hui moved among the crystal cactuses, leaving more and more injuries upon them.

Jia Shidao and the others were also overjoyed. Liu Che said, “That crystal cactus is impressive. It’s fortunate that we have both Luo Yu and Luo Hui. Otherwise, we wouldn’t stand a chance of killing them.”

Jia Shidao also nodded and said excitedly, “We can finally get a life geno essence, so this trip won’t have been in vain.”

After almost three hours, Luo Hui finally broke the crystal cactus with his Truth Spear, and they watched the crystal cactus dissipate. However, no life geno essence was left behind.

Luo Yu and Luo Hui had used too much energy, so they had to retreat.

“What’s happening? Where’s the life geno essence?” asked Jia Shidao, confused.

Luo Hui frowned. “It’s so strange. Though we killed that crystal cactus, we didn’t hear any notification of it being killed.”

“No notification at all? How is that possible?” Jia Shidao couldn’t believe it.

“Something’s strange about that crystal cactus,” said Luo Yu. “If it’s actually a super creature, it should have left behind a life geno essence.”

Jia Shidao thought it made sense. Though he rose to the Fourth God’s Sanctuary before killing super creatures became common in the previous sanctuaries, the life geno essence wasn’t a secret anymore, and he knew that ordinary super creatures all had a life geno essence. This cactus didn’t have one though, so something was definitely wrong with it.

“We’ve lost too much energy. Let’s rest for a while, and then we can kill another crystal cactus and see,” Luo Yu said, then looked at Han Sen. “You’ve already seen the crystal cactuses and their powers. Don’t you want to go and kill one?”

“Okay.” Han Sen didn’t decline this time.

Han Sen had watched carefully as Luo Yu and Luo Hui fought. These crystal cactuses weren’t much different from the ordinary cactuses, aside from stronger thorn-spewing power and sturdier bodies.

Luo Yu and the others saw Han Sen going, and they couldn’t help frowning. They didn’t know what Han Sen had that would allow him to defend himself against the cactus and kill it at the same time.

Jia Shidao looked at Han Sen, surprised. He was surprised that Han Sen dared to go attack it after seeing the impressive abilities of the crystal cactuses.

Luo Li wasn’t surprised at all. She watched Han Sen, curious about how powerful he had become.

Han Sen left Little Silver behind, and he walked toward a pillar-like cactus twelve feet tall. The cactus was triggered and began to fire crystal thorns toward him. They were extremely fast, and they didn’t give him a chance to dodge.

Han Sen didn’t intend to dodge them; instead, he summoned his Overbearing shield, which was exactly the right size to protect him against the thorns, and then he kept walking with the shield in his hand.

The thorns hit the shield with a rattling noise.

Luo Yu and Jia Shidao opened their eyes wide when they saw the crystal thorns failing to pierce through Han Sen’s shield. However, what happened next shocked them to their very core.

Not only was the shield unharmed, but the thorns bounced off the shield so hard that they buried themselves back in the cactus. Though they didn’t do much harm, it was still quite unbelievable.

“What kind of beast soul is that? It’s deflecting all the attacks from the super creature?” said Luo Hui, surprised.

“It’s only a beast soul. It doesn’t mean anything. That’s only his tool, not the power he actually has,” said Luo Yu coldly.

Han Sen continued walking toward the crystal cactus. He summoned his Split-Blade geno core and slashed the cactus like he was cutting a water vat.

The cactus that took Luo Hui more than two hours to break was slashed in half by Han Sen with only one strike, and he didn’t even need to strike it a second time.

“How is that possible?” Luo Yu couldn’t stay calm anymore. He stared incredulously as the crystal cactus faded away and Han Sen stood in front of it.

Jia Shidao and the others were completely bewildered. They had thought that Luo Yu and Luo Hui were very powerful, yet those two couldn’t even compare with Han Sen.

It had taken Luo Yu and Luo Hui hours to kill one crystal cactus, yet Han Sen killed one with a single strike. The gap between them was so huge that they weren’t even in the same league.

Luo Li was shocked as well. She knew that Han Sen was strong, yet this was beyond what even she had guessed.

“There isn’t any notification after you kill one. Are these crystal cactuses really creatures?” Han Sen frowned. Just as Luo Hui had said, no notification sounded as the cactus disappeared.

Just as Han Sen was looking around in confusion, the crystal cactuses all started to move. By the time everyone realized what was happening, the crystal cactuses had surrounded them, much to everyone’s horror.
