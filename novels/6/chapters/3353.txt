Two Demons Fighting

“How are you going to settle this? Do you plan on killing me? It is not as if I look down on you, but your power is not sufficient. You won’t have what it takes.” Big sky demon looked at him with disdain.Ancient Devil coldly said, “I cannot kill you, but for as long as I draw breath, you will not be taking the leader’s stuff. It never belonged to you. Be wary of karma taking you.”“If I do not have what it takes to claim it, then you will not be able to take it either,” big sky demon said. “Do not forget that I was the first vice president of the God Chaos Party.”

“So, what if you were the first vice president? Let’s not say the God Chaos Party is practically done for, but even if they were around to protect these items, it should be vice president Bury Path God and not you, big sky demon.” Ancient Devil looked at her with disdain as he spoke.

“Does that mean you are going to fight me for it?” Big sky demon coldly asked.

When Han Sen heard that, he thought the pair was going to engage in a big battle. Ancient Devil swiftly changed his tune and coldly said, “I am not fighting against you, but I did find the real master of this item. I am taking it so that I may return it. Are you still going to fight me for that item?”

“You said you found it, yet you expect me to believe you. I can say I found the right person too.” Big sky demon was not so easily swayed.

Ancient Devil was not angry. He went on to say, “Back in the day, when the universe reopened, Mister Leader sent him to the geno universe so he could avoid the damage done by the reboot universe. Back then, I knew this. That was why I reincarnated. I went to the geno universe so that I could find him.”

“Does that mean you found it? If that is the case, why don’t you tell me where he is now?” Big sky demon looked at him mockingly.

“It is a ‘her,’ and her name is Bao’er,” Ancient Devil said. “You might have not heard that name before, but you will know the person who raised her. It is Han Sen.”

Han Sen was shocked to hear this. He could not believe Bao’er was at the core of the discussion they had been having for all this time. His ears perked up, and his heart started to beat at an abnormal pace. He wanted to learn even more secrets about Bao’er from them.

Big sky demon did not speak. When she heard Ancient Devil, she said, “Judging from the look on your face, it seems as if you have already seen Bao’er.”

“So, what if I have?” Big sky demon coldly grunted.

“If you knew Master Bao’er was back, why are you and I still fighting over this?” Ancient Devil asked.

Big sky demon looked at him with disdain. She lifted her lips and said, “Ancient Devil, Ancient Devil, you underestimate me. How am I supposed to know if you are helping Bao’er or secretly doing this for yourself? Even if you did deliver this to Master Bao’er, it should be me holding onto it.”

“If you do not trust me, how am I supposed to trust you?” Ancient Devil asked back.

“After all this talk, we need to see which of us has the bigger fist,” big sky demon said. “You and I have never liked each other anyway. Let’s just fight here.”

After that, Han Sen heard some hitting noises. Ancient Devil and big sky demon were already fighting.

“Stop fighting! You guys should just explain things first.” Han Sen was in a hurry. He used his Dongxuan Aura to go past the rat hole. He went through the crooked tunnels to finally find Ancient Devil and big sky demon.

They were about 900 feet away from Han Sen’s copper palace. They were in another palace, and they were fighting hard.

It was unknown what they used, but they were not restricted by Dust Sky either. Big sky demon’s body was like a ghost, and Ancient Devil was like a mountain that could not move. He kept standing on the spot.

Still, one could tell that Ancient Devil’s geno arts were changing even if his Break World rate was still very low. Big sky demon kept putting him on the defensive. He could not fight back. It would not take long before he lost.

The two of their geno arts were very weird. All the geno arts they used were something they were already familiar with. Now, nobody repeated the same geno arts. It made Han Sen feel shocked by how much skill they had. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ancient Devil had been restricted a lot, so he madly shouted, “Big sky demon, don’t you be such a bully!”

“So, what if I bully you? You have been reincarnated for a billion years, yet you only reached this rate. You deserve to be bullied.” Big Sky Demon mocked him.

“Fine. I will let you know that I am someone you can easily bully.” Ancient Devil was very angry. Black demon air arose on his body. The gold shadow of an old Buddha started to cloak him. Suddenly, the black demon air turned into a gold Buddha light.

Big sky demon’s ghost-like grey sky demon power hit the gold Buddha light. It was not as oppressive as before. It was just a little bit better.

“Double Spirit Break World!” Big sky demon was shocked.

Ancient Devil coldly said, “Reincarnating wasted a lot of my time, but it was not as if I earned nothing out of it. Do you remember Mister Leader talking about the sanctuaries? I reincarnated there.”

“You were lucky to reincarnate in that sacred land. It is no wonder why you have a double soul. I suppose that did not happen by accident.” Big Sky Demon kept fighting while talking to Ancient Devil.

Ancient Devil did the same. He kept fighting while he answered, “Yes, it was not solely through luck. The old leader sent Master Bao’er to that place. I was looking for Master Bao’er, so I had to reincarnate to go there. Reincarnating in the sanctuaries was costly. It cost me a lot. My entire soul almost faded.”

“It is a shame that even though you did get something good in the land of holy spirits, you will still be unable to beat me.” Big sky demon laughed coldly.

“Yes, you are right. I cannot defeat you. But if you want to kill me, you will end up paying a big price too. If Bury Path God comes back now, do you think you can still retrieve that item? His desire to claim that item is the same as it is for you and I.” Ancient Devil looked like he wanted to get through to big sky demon and sort the fight out with his silver tongue.

Big sky demon did not do anything. She still looked murderous as she said, “In that case, I will have to kill you before Bury Path God comes back.”

While they were talking, big sky demon’s hand possessed a strange hand mark. Some weird sort of power was shivering through her hand. Han Sen hadn’t quite figured out what was going on just yet, but he felt his Dongxuan Aura get broken. He lost his sense there.

When Han Sen got his Dongxuan Aura back, he noticed Ancient Devil’s chest had been penetrated. It went right through his heart, making him bleed gold demon blood. It looked like he was not going to live.

Big sky demon was not doing too well either. She was looking much weaker now. She seemed really weak. Her mouth dribbled blood.

“The grudge between you and I must come to an end,” big sky demon said as she gathered up power. She was giving Ancient Devil the finishing blow.

A cold voice suddenly sounded. “Good work, guys. Without you two, I would have been unable to find this place.”

Han Sen was shocked. He opened the copper door in the copper hall. Bury Path God had just walked in.
