Chapter 2223 Queen Bai Wei

“Knight King, the new member you are telling us about is her?” Han Sen looked at Bai Wei strangely. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Yes, Bai Wei is the latest addition to your team. Please co-operate with her.” Ice Blue Knight King smiled.

“Knight King, if there is naught else to discuss, I will return and prepare,” Bai Wei coldly said.

“Go.” Ice Blue Knight King nodded.

Bai Wei coldly departed the room. Meanwhile, Han Sen feigned sadness as he spoke again to Ice Blue Knight King. “Knight King, did you see that? She does not even show you respect. How am I supposed to control someone like that? You should give her to another group.”

Ice Blue Knight King touched Han Sen’s shoulder before sitting down. He poured out some tea and told Han Sen to take a seat and join him. Han Sen knew Ice Blue Knight King had something to tell him, so he obliged and sat down.

Ice Blue Knight King had a sip of his tea and said, “I am not giving her to your team for the purpose of control. She will be with you because I wish for you to protect her.”

“Who is she?” Han Sen asked with a frown.

“She is Queen Bai Wei. You might not have heard of her name before, but you must surely know what it implies,” Ice Blue Knight King said.

“A daughter of one of the Extreme King’s kings?” Han Sen immediately understood why she had been so cocky. If she was a daughter of an Extreme King king, then she had what it took to behave the way she did.

“She has made mistakes, so a king seeks to punish her by sending her here. But the king also wishes for her to practice more. While that must be done, I cannot afford anything ill to befall her, so you must ensure she remains protected. If something happens to her, you and I will both be killed.” Ice Blue Knight King smiled.

“Why don’t you find a high-level knight to look after her, then? I doubt there is much I can do to protect her.” Han Sen had a wry smile, and he thought the task was a bad one to receive.

“If there was a King class fellow protecting her, she would not have the opportunity to practice. Plus, she is full of pride. She would not allow that.” Ice Blue Knight King let out a sigh.

“The Ice Blue Knights have many backup teams. Surely you need not rely on outsiders like us. Don’t you think it’s dangerous to task outsiders with such an important responsibility?” Han Sen looked at Ice Blue Knight King as he spoke.

Ice Blue Knight King looked back at Han Sen, and then he spoke in a strange tone of voice. “Han Sen, do you know who I trust the most out of the Ice Blue Knights?”

“Of course I do. Your subordinates,” Han Sen said.

Ice Blue Knight King shook his head and resumed his gaze on Han Sen. He told him, “It is you. I trust you the most.”

“You have got to be kidding me. I have only just met you...” Before Han Sen could finish speaking, Ice Blue Knight King stopped him.

“Please don’t think I’m actually joking about this. You have never been in my position. You would not understand the reasons for me only being able to trust you. And so, I am letting you look after Queen Bai Wei. If she lives, you live. If she dies, you die. You are a smart boy, so I believe you know what to do.” Ice Blue Knight King patted Han Sen on the shoulder and then left the office.

Han Sen did not want to be burdened with the troubles of other people like that, but Ice Blue Knight King had made it quite clear that his problems did not solely rely on renegade xenogeneics. There were troubles stemming from the internal affairs of the Ice Blue Knights.

But Ice Blue Knight King, after stressing the need for Han Sen to do that which was bidden of him, had Han Sen forfeit reluctance and accept the task.

Han Sen kept thinking all the while he walked back to his room. His heart jumped, and his pupils shrunk when he neared there. All the hairs on his body stood on end.

No scary power attacked him, and neither did a foreign presence, but Han Sen felt as if he was being watched by a snake. He felt as if he were in danger all of a sudden.

Han Sen looked forward, and there he saw a slender body approaching from up ahead.

That should have been a pure Extreme King man, but his presence was hidden. Being unable to determine his level, the man looked like the average person.

The delicate face of the man was like a jade sculpture that had been meticulously crafted by the hands of a genuine master. His blonde hair was smart, and the face carried eyes as deep as lakes that could reflect the world and people they looked upon. It looked nice.

He was a shockingly perfect looking man. While he seemed very pleasant, Han Sen couldn’t help but internally scream at the potential for danger in his proximity.

Han Sen walked close to the man, and the man stared at Han Sen. Just as they were about to pass each other, the man stopped and said coldly, “Have you seen the secret held by the stone plate?”

“What did you say?” Han Sen was shocked. He stopped and looked at him.

The man smiled at Han Sen, and to a man like Han Sen, that smile was as warm as the sun. It could melt the coldest blocks of ice, and if he was speaking to a woman, that woman would do anything he commanded her to do.

Han Sen did not say anything. The man merely smiled and walked past Han Sen.

“Edward.” Han Sen did not look at the man. He just kept going. He walked straight to his room. He had never seen that man before, but he was quick to understand that it was Inspector Edward.

“It seems as if he knows I am the one that took the stone plate. What an annoying and dangerous guy. If he is an inspector, though, then that means he should be a King,” Han Sen thought to himself.

Edward walked into a room. There was an Ice Blue Knight there that was looking at a camera recording. The video was playing the encounter between Han Sen and Edward.

“His reactions are natural. It doesn’t look as if he is pretending. Perhaps we are wrong,” the Ice Blue Knight said.

Edward looked at the video and laughed like spring sunshine. “We are right, actually. He is the one that took the stone plate.”

“Why?” The Ice Blue Knight gazed at Edward with suspicion.

“He behaved too naturally when he saw me. Not many Marquises can remain that natural upon seeing me. The more natural they are, the more suspicious they are.” Edward stared at Han Sen’s face on the screen. I did not know Knife Queen had selected such an interesting student.

“Should we move?” The Ice Blue Knight did not proclaim his thoughts on Edward’s assessment, so he posed the question.

“No. Ice Blue Knight King and Mister White are still here. We cannot fight while they are here.” Edward laughed. “But these are the systems of chaos, and so it is not as if he could run. He is interesting, but he is just a Marquise. Therefore, he is weak.

“Mister Inspector, do you think he is one of Mister White’s people?” The Ice Blue Knight asked.

“No. If he was, then Mister White would be the one with the item right now. Do you think Mister White would still stay with the knights and provide us the opportunity to get it back?” Edward looked at Han Sen’s face with interest. “This guy is funny. If he took the relic, we must get the relic back before the other knights find out. Otherwise, it’ll be annoying.”
