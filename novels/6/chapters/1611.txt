Chapter 1612: Enemy Coming

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Twelve-Winged Dark Seraphim

After the meeting, Tina went up to Qing Ya with a request. “Uncle Qing Ya, can you take me with you? I want to see that human die.”

“Last time you snuck out and lost the geno armor. That upset the leader, so you should stay home. I don’t think he’d want you going out this time.” Qing Ya gave her a smile.

“Uncle Qing Ya, it’s because Han Sen stole it from me that I want to watch him die. Kill him and take the armor back. Oh, please take me with you.” Tina swung Qing Ya’s arms as she pleaded.

“I don’t think so. You can ask Sha Linjia, though. If he says it’s okay, then I will bring you along,” Qing Ya said.

Tina lifted her lips and said, “Sha Linjia is nothing. He is only a shura. I don’t need his permission. Uncle Qing Ya, please take me. I want to go! That Han Sen is going to die, and Father is practicing. If something bad happens, you can protect me.”

Tina begged for a while, until Qing Ya had no choice but to agree and say, “Fine, I will take you. But you have to listen to everything I tell you. If you don’t, I won’t be taking you anywhere.”

“Uncle Qing Ya, you are the best! I will listen to everything you tell me.” Tina was very happy.

“Go and pack up. Wait for Sha Linjia’s command,” Qing Ya told her.

Tina was not happy about that, though. Again, she lifted her lips. She said, “That Sha Linjia is nothing. He is much worse than you. I don’t know why Father trusts him so much and lets him do what he wants.”

“If he can earn the leader’s trust as he has, then that means only one thing: he is good. Just go and ready up.”

Han Sen was packing in his house. He decided to fly the beetle to Planet Tariq. Even if the leader wasn’t there, he was happy to take out a few lackeys and goons in a good raid. He wanted to let them know that Han Sen was not someone you could bully. He wanted to send a message and end their attempts to push him around.

Han Sen flew the beetle for two days, but he was still in hyperspace. He received a message from an unknown number. “There is danger. Leave Shadow Shelter now. Blind Man.”

Han Sen was shocked to hear this. Blind Man had sent him a concerning alert, and on top of that, he had used an unsafe method of sending it. If Blind Man did not have the time to visit Han Sen personally, then that meant it had to be an emergency.

“Does the New Community wish to attack Shadow Shelter? That should be impossible! Shadow Shelter is not big, but that’s where I am. With Gu Qingcheng and Little Pony there, too, not even a super shelter should be able to conquer us. What makes them think they have what it takes to do that? Gah, true or false, I suppose it is best to return and make sure.” After a moment of extra thought, Han Sen made his decision. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Shadow Shelter was three hundred miles away. There were a dozen shura fighters situated in a canyon. When the shura were able to enter the sanctuary, many would go there for the simple adventure. But the shelter’s genes and beast souls were useless for the shura, meaning not many took the time to go.

Now that there were a dozen there, humans who spotted them would be given a massive fright. They were, after all, all fourth rank fighters.

The shura fighters were accompanied by horrible creatures. It was obvious that they were super creatures, too.

Sha Linjia looked at the super creatures and shura gathered and was pleased. He said, “Good. We have to go, and we have to end Han Sen this time, once and for all.”

“Qing Ya, stay next to me,” Sha Linjia said, looking at Qing Ya.

Qing Ya simply nodded and didn’t say a word.

Sha Linjia patted the beast he rode upon, and then it released a mist that camouflaged the enclave on their way towards Shadow Shelter.

Cheap Sheep was with Green Cow and the others in Shadow Shelter like usual. As he walked, he saw Gu Qingcheng venture towards the gate of the shelter. With a forced smile, Cheap Sheep approached and said, “If you need anything, I can go grab it for you. There’s no need for you to leave on an errand.”

“Kick everyone out of here,” Gu Qingcheng said coldly, eyes peering out beyond the gates.

“What?” Cheap Sheep and Green Cow froze, unsure of what was happening.

“All the creatures, you two included, need to leave. You need to get out if you want to live, and go as far as you can. Don’t make me tell you this again,” Gu Qingcheng said, then went beyond the gate of the shelter.

Cheap Sheep and Green Cow froze in place. They did not know what they should do. They didn’t dare ask her again, and they’d feel terrible if they simply left without telling Han Sen. Cheap Sheep couldn’t act on this command.

“Just do what she said,” said a soft voice. Cheap Sheep and Green Cow were frozen until that voice greeted them. It was Little Silver approaching, and the voice came from him.

It wasn’t just Little Silver, either. Starsea Beast, Ice Seahorse, and the lazy Red Pony appeared, coming out from the garden, as well.

Every important member of the shelter came forward, which told Cheap Sheep and Green Cow something important was about to happen.

“What’s going on? Should we inform the boss?” They knew Little Silver was Han Sen’s favorite pet. Her words wouldn’t be wrong, but they asked, just to make sure.

“It’s okay. Just go before it is too late.” Little Silver then ran outside the shelter.

Cheap Sheep and Green Cow realized things were bad. They followed Little Silver’s advice and got on with evacuating all the other creatures from the premises. They had no clue what was going on, and it led to much discussion. Many refused to leave.

Cheap Sheep then ran out of the gate to speak with Little Silver and Gu Qingcheng. He said, “This is a little difficult, as I cannot convince them all to leave.”

“It doesn’t matter now, anyway. It is too late,” Gu Qingcheng said, looking forward.

There was a mist approaching in the distance, and scary creatures soon emerged from it. Atop the backs of the creatures were humanoid-like creatures, all with horns upon their heads.

Cheap Sheep and Green Cow, when they saw that horde, almost wet themselves. The life-forces of the creatures were incredibly frightening.

Now they knew why Gu Qingcheng had suggested everyone should leave. The shelter was in big trouble.
