Chapter 3372 - Geno Prototype Armor

Qin Xiu’s body was like a ghost. Han Sen’s attacks were like thunder. They created a storm all around. Even so, the rage was unable to move Qin Xiu.

Since he was wrapped up by the black armor, it was like he was walking around extinguishing Han Sen’s attacks and rendering them absolutely futile.

Although Han Sen moved his weird body to the max, he was unable to achieve breakthrough success. He was still unable to deal damage to Qin Xiu.

Qin Xiu’s eyes looked frozen. The black crystal armor became smaller. His hands were thrust into the sky. The black crystal armor that wrapped up his fist started to produce a black halo.

Pang!

Han Sen emerged from the nothingness. He was punched in the chest. That punch made Han Sen stumble back, but he was not injured by it.

Beneath the force of that punch, the black crystal armor that clad Qin Xiu’s fist actually cracked. It was like it had adopted a new life. It was becoming many black crystal shards. They locked onto Han Sen with the intent to pepper him with holes. Suddenly, Han Sen’s body was wrapped up by black crystal pieces.

Han Sen wanted to rush out and escape the black crystal armor’s binding technique. Despite being a shadow, his body was unable to escape the black crystal armor’s trap.

Qin Xiu looked at the prison armor and spoke to Han Sen. “It is pointless. This geno armor was created by a geno prototype. The gene messages of the entire world are in here. The power of the entire world resides within it. In this world, there exists no type of power that can prove a threat to it.”

Han Sen did not believe what he was being told. He kept using his powers to try and escape. Despite the strength he exerted, the black crystal armor was unaffected. The power that was able to destroy the sky and the earth was just a wave upon a sea for the black crystal armor.

It was the same black crystal armor, but Han Sen did not feel the black crystal armor was the same one he used to own.

“Han Sen. Oh, Han Sen. Ever a pest, aren’t you? But aren’t I ever-gracious?” Qin Xiu coldly said, “I am going to make you that offer one more time, and I recommend that you take it. It is far greater than you deserve. Why don’t you remove yourself from your weird connection with Wan’er and let her body be free? Do that, and I can allow you to live.”

“You think you know me, but I can assure you that you don’t. I have never accepted a life that is given through the mercy of others. I never have, and I never will.” Han Sen’s power kept exploding. His power was becoming stronger. The black crystal armor that wrapped him up became bigger, but it never fell away from him.

Qin Xiu coldly said, “I have already told you that the geno prototype is the origin of the world. The power that exists in this world, no matter how much your power changes, comes from this. You cannot overcome this power. There are only two powers that can affect it. One power enables a reboot of the universe, which is something only a Reboot-class God Spirit can do. Even if your Break World rate reaches 100%, you cannot be a Reboot-class God Spirit and enable a universe reboot. Even if the universe reboots, you cannot break the geno prototype. There is a power inside it that transcends the world. It is something greater than the world. You need something greater than that to break the geno prototype. It is a shame no one possesses such a power.”

Han Sen did not speak. He just wanted to madly explode his power. He felt his body surge with many powerful powers. For some reason, he could not express them.

Qin Xiu saw that Han Sen was refusing to speak, so he started to look mean. He stopped talking. He put his hand on Han Sen’s head, which made the black crystal armor develop a black and weird light. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Qin Xiu looked into Han Sen’s eyes and spoke each word sternly. “Leave Wan’er’s body. This is your last chance.”

Only Han Sen’s power answered him. His black crystal armor was bloated. It made a “wa-la” sound. Even so, it still imprisoned his body.

Qin Xiu did not speak. His eyes looked strange. The black crystal armor had a weird substance chain light. It made the black crystal armor, which was wrapping up Han Sen, start to flicker.

The black crystal armor that wrapped up Han Sen became smaller. It trapped Han Sen’s body. It made Han Sen feel as if countless needles were pricking him deep within his nerves. It was like all these needles were madly sucking the substances out of him.

“You used to have the geno prototype armor,” Qin Xiu coldly said. “It is such a shame you were never able to become its master. You will never know its true power. Let me show you its power now.”

Han Sen finally spoke. “No matter how grand this geno prototype armor is, it is not your work. How can you speak so boisterously?”

Qin Xiu coldly laughed. “It looks like you already know where this geno prototype armor comes from. Yes, this geno prototype armor belonged to the God Chaos Party’s old leader. It is the greatest armor to ever exist in the entire universe. With this armor, the God Chaos Party Leader was able to battle the geno hall. It could have even allowed him to be above the geno hall.”

“God Chaos Party Leader depended on the geno tablet,” Han Sen said.

“It looks like what you truly know is quite limited,” Qin Xiu said. “The geno tablet is an item designed to replace the geno hall. It is powerful, but it was never meant to be used by one person. It was a tool used to control the main and reverse universes. It is a sign of power.”

“I see.” Han Sen felt the power in his body be taken by the black crystal armor. This kind of action did not actually drain his power. It made him feel how strong his body was.

After the power was sucked away, it made the power inside his body become vast. It was sort of like an endless sea.

Qin Xiu’s body of black crystal armor flickered with the lights of a mysterious spell. The spell kept appearing like countless codes flickering. Qin Xiu’s eyes looked very evil.

He wanted to steal Han Sen’s gene message and remove it from his body. That way, only Wan’er would remain.

This was the black crystal armor’s unique power. Aside from the black crystal armor, there was no other power that could analyze the gene messages of creatures. Only the black crystal armor could do this.

After Qin Xiu took Han Sen’s gene messages, the power of the black crystal armor kept calculating. It did not stop.

“How is that possible?” Qin Xiu was shocked.

The geno prototype armor was a gene base for the universe. Even the genes of spirits resided within it. It could not just analyze the gene message of a creature. Even the whole evolution of a race could be seen by it.

Now, the geno prototype armor was still madly analyzing. It was like Han Sen had too many body messages. It was going to be overloaded. They still could not analyze things.
