1815 Maxing Out Genes

“Xenogeneic Gene Consumed: Baron Geno Point +1”

Han Sen cooked a few of the bananas over a fire. As they cooked, the bananas quickly softened from their previous crystallike state. Each banana increased one Baron gene. Before he had finished eating them all, he reached one hundred Baron genes.

“Baron geno points at max. Point collection can no longer continue. The geno body requires a special fruit”

Han Sen ate another banana, and the same announcement played.

In the sanctuaries, when your geno points maxed out, you could evolve via the evolution pools. In the geno universe, things didn’t behave like that. He had no clue how to break through and ascend.

“Does this mean I have to initiate the breakthrough myself?” Han Sen kept thinking, but this was the only possibility that came to mind.

It was pointless to keep eating the same geno fruit, so he packed it up and went back to the sanctuary.

When Xie Qing King saw Han Sen, he ran up to him, pounding his puffed-up chest.

“Old Han, I can generate geno armor. Take me to the geno universe and I will use my handsome body and awesome comics to conquer that place.”

“Me, too,” Little Angel said calmly.

“Me, too,” came Zero’s soft voice.

“Me, too. Me, too.” Many people kept saying they were done and ready to go. If Luolan and Ji Yanran reached that level, they’d probably want to go, as well. Especially so, with the prospect of searching for Littleflower.

“Stop! Stop! What do you guys think that place is? It’s not like moving to a new house. You might die out there. At least give me some more time to prepare a nice, safe place for you to settle into. Little Silver, you can ascend and come to the geno universe, too.”

Han Sen went back to Planet Kate, now having to think about a serious matter.

Because he had brought back many xenogeneic genes, many of his people could generate their geno armor. A lot of them were dying to come, and he knew it’d be impossible to stop them forever.

This was especially true for Xie Qing King and Gu Qincheng. They would undoubtedly try something stupid if Han Sen did not bring them soon.

“I need to find a safe place to build a base for us. If I do that, they can come. But where can I find such a safe place?” Han Sen took Little Invisible toward one of the nearby cities. After two days of travel, they reached it.

Little Invisible was the chameleon’s new name. The creature seemed happy with it.

Fortunately, there was no fighting going on in that city. It was still under the full control of the people of Kate. There, Han Sen was able to buy a phone with which he could contact Qiao and Lan Se.

Qiao told Han Sen that Gran City had fallen and that they had joined Seven Mirrors. They were on a ship headed there. She told Han Sen to come to her, because he could join the land reclamation operations instead of just fighting all the time.

Han Sen thought the idea wasn’t too bad. If he could find a place without higher races running around and hunting down xenogeneics, that would be perfect for his companions to get their foot in the door and grow.

But the city he was in did not have a ship heading for Seven Mirrors. He couldn’t go.

On the streets of Mississippi City, everyone was hurriedly minding their own business. No one really concerned themselves with others. The place hadn’t been invaded by the Taurus yet, but the people knew that it was only a matter of time before it happened.

Planet Kate was in freefall, and everyone had to think about where their future would lead and what they could do. Many ships there were still transporting refugees into space.

The crowds were huge, and they could not all fit. Most of them would have to wait for some time before they could make it off the planet

On that miserable street, there was someone who didn’t quite look like the rest of those dreary people. The man was walking down the street without armor. He wore clothing made of real cloth, and he also held a small banner in his hands.

There were some strange words written across it, but it was not of a common language. Han Sen, however, would have recognized them if he had seen them.

While the man was walking, a tall woman with white bunny ears approached him. She was wearing a mask. She pulled out a knife and placed the blade against the man’s neck.

People continued walking by, and the man and woman were suddenly covered by a strange power. It isolated them on the busy street, making it seem like they weren’t there at all. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“My Queen! What do you want?” The man was not afraid of having a drawn knife against his neck. He looked at the woman with surprise, though.

That woman was the Knife Queen of the Rebate. It was Yisha, whom Han Sen had almost killed.

Yisha looked at the man with cold eyes and said, “Do you want to live? Or do you want to die?”

“I haven’t lived enough, so yeah! I want to live.” The man laughed.

“If you want to live, give me a reading,” Yisha said coldly.

The man looked at Yisha, smiled, and said, “My Queen, might I ask if my previous prediction was accurate?”

“Huh.” Yisha hummed and did not answer the man. She went on to say, “Predict my future and that of the man named Dollar. He who is a human.”

Yisha had been waiting outside Demon Grave for a very long time. Even after a storm started on the inside, Dollar still hadn’t come to the exit point.

She did not believe Dollar would find himself trapped in Demon Grave for any long stretch of time, but she had tried everything in search of him. She just couldn’t locate the man. So, she had come here to ask the man for help in finding the elusive Dollar.

“You will meet him when fate decides your paths will intertwine. For now, you should let it go.” The man smiled.

“I don’t believe that. Find him for me, unless you want to die!” Yisha said angrily.

The man gave a wry smile as he shook his head. “My Queen, you are being stubborn. If you do not believe in fates, then why do you wish to hear what I can predict?”

Yisha frowned. She did not want to believe what the man was telling her, but she had already received a reading from him before she went to Demon Grave. The reading had turned out to be truthful, so she felt strangely compelled by what he told her.

Although she did not want to believe that this man could foresee the future and perceives destinies, she did.

“I am asking you if you’ll do it or not” Yisha coldly looked at him, with the knife still raised to his neck.

“Of course. But you cannot challenge fate. Even if I did know where he was, you couldn’t meet him. And then you would blame me for not being accurate.” The man sighed.

“Are you saying you won’t do it?” Yisha looked as if she was ready to slash.

“You can’t challenge fate. You cannot force me. Everyone here has their own destiny. Their lives are small, but not even God can change the roads they follow. They cannot be made a queen like you. But I am just a clairvoyant,” the man said.

“Who says you cannot challenge and change fate? If I wanted to, I could make even an ant into a giant beast,” Yisha said coldly.

The man smiled and said, “If you have such confidence... How about we make a bet?”
