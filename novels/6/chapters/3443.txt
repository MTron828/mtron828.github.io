Chapter 3444 A Way

“Chaos was born in the geno universe. Was she able to light up a lantern in the geno hall? If that was the case, that should be something so scary.” Han Sen was shocked.

His will was going to break soon. If the word fairy meant Chaos, then the power must have been unimaginable. She surely would have been the creature closest to that step.

From within that god light, a woman who looked like a fairy and a jade started to come. She stepped out of the dust cloud. Holy was not a word that could be used to describe her anymore. It was like she was the most spiritual being in all of the universe.

Every inch and every centimeter of her body, and even the garments she wore, were very elegant. The aura she exuded was truly out of this world.

Her appearance made Han Sen’s very tense will become weaker. He was like a rubber band that was now being pulled to the max. It was going to snap any second.

“Crape Myrtle said that on the evolution wall, no creature had ever managed to reach the Universe class. If that is true, what could possibly be up with this fairy? Her powers are still so strong. She is better than any other creature I have ever encountered, but can a creature this mighty not have reached Universe class yet?” Han Sen was shocked by the power he was witnessing.

His will was becoming overwhelmed. If the fairy’s power came down, Han Sen would be unable to hold it. If his will broke, even if he did not turn into an idiot, he would lose all of the confidence he had in himself and any faith he had in his abilities of combat. For a fighter, that was the worst possible outcome.

Power was the foundation of an elite, but courage was the soul of an elite. Without a soul, having a powerful body meant very little. It meant one would just be a weak person with very powerful power. While Han Sen was still mulling all of this over, the fairy woman’s power descended.

“Crape Myrtle, you just got me killed. If you turn me into an idiot, I will curse your son so he does not have a penis.” Han Sen cursed him, but he had to focus if he wanted to fight back against that scary power.

Boom!

When the power descended, Han Sen’s brain felt as if it had exploded. It was very oppressive. It was rather like a river. It kept hitting his mental dam, which seemed as if it was going to break any second now.

Space Garden was fighting back against the enemy tide as hard as they could. Their resilience was far greater than the elders of the God Chaos Party could have anticipated. Just a small number of Space Garden’s forces were able to repel and break the advance of God Chaos Party’s many elites and Break World monsters. Many Break World beasts attacked, but they too were repelled.

“This is so scary. This is just a small amount of Space Garden’s whole power. There are so many Break World elites in their ranks. If they keep developing, God Chaos Party might not be able to rein them in and keep them on a leash.”

“Mister Leader is so smart. He could already understand the threat of Space Garden, and he has already sought their removal.”

“That might indeed be the case, but we have already sent out God Chaos Party’s entire forces. Yet, we still have not been able to capture Space Garden. Should we call upon the leader to help us out?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Inside a battleship, a few God Chaos Party elders were discussing matters in a private meeting. An elder said, “No. Human King has only just become the geno tablet’s master. He has become the master. If I cannot do this without his involvement, he will not make use of me anymore.”

“But if you do not ask for help, even if you do get Space Garden, most of God Chaos Party will be dead,” another elder said, disagreeing with the last one. “There will be very little left of us. With our current power, how are we supposed to secure an important seat in our party?” “The two of you are right in your own way,” said another elder with a bird face. “We have to do this, but we cannot give up all of our wealth.”

“Bird Elder, you are the one with the most creative ideas here. What do you propose we do to combine both of these ideas?” Every elder looked at the bird-like elder.

Bird Elder laughed. “Our mission is to get Han Sen’s stepdaughter, Han Bao’er, out of there. Mister Leader never told us to destroy Space Garden, so why are we doing things this way?” “Is there a difference between them? In Space Garden, these guys are going to protect Han Sen’s stepdaughter. If we do not defeat Space Garden, how can we force Han Bao’er out of there?” The elder from earlier did not understand, so he asked for clarification.

Bird Elder lifted his lips and said, “You guys have been alive for so long. Have you also become dogs in that time? Before you came, did you not spend time investigating the Han Sen family?”

“Bird Elder, why don’t you just hurry up and spill the beans?” a grumpy elder asked while looking at Bird Elder with displeasure. “We are all elders, so there is no need to hide things.”

Bird Elder took a deep breath and said, “From what I know, Han Sen has two daughters. He also has a few stepdaughters. Han Bao’er is the one who is loved the most. She is treated as well as a biological one.”

“If I had a stepdaughter who was that excellent, I would also treat her as well as a biological daughter,” an elder said while lifting his lips. “When she grew up, our family would reap all sorts of glories.”

Bird Elder coughed. “This has nothing to do with what I am saying. What I want to say is that Han Sen and Han Bao’er have a great relationship. They are like a real father and daughter. And that isn’t with just Han Sen either. Even Han Sen’s wife treats Han Bao’er like a real mother would. Han Sen’s children are treated like real siblings by Han Bao’er too. We do not actually require Space Garden. All we must do is capture Han Sen’s family. Then, Han Bao’er will be willing to do everything.”

“Why should we only capture Han Sen’s wife and daughter?” an elder asked with confusion.

Bird Elder pointed at Littleflower, who was in the middle of fighting Itchy, and said, “That is Han Sen’s biological son. If you think you can capture him, then go and capture him.” An elder went to have a look. He squeezed his neck. Someone as terrifying as Itchy was actually getting bullied by Littleflower. If it was not for other God Chaos Party members helping him out, he would have died by now. He did not dare to try to capture that boy.

Bird Elder watched him stop talking and said, “All of the elites are out now. They have left Space Garden, leaving the place empty and unprotected. We should slip inside now and capture Han Sen’s wife and daughter. If we do that, it is our best chance at success.”

“But the Space Garden’s bai sema is weird. Many Break World beasts have been attacking it for so long, yet they have been unable to break it. How are we supposed to gain access?” A bunch of elders looked at Bird Elder weirdly, knowing he would have a way around this. He should have had a suggestion to gain access.

“That is easy,” Bird Elder said. “Of course, we cannot get inside, but don’t forget that a special Break World beast came with us.”

“A bai sema beast can only go through bai sema. They cannot break the bai sema though. What is the point of it going in alone? This bai sema beast has only just managed to break the world. It is not very strong. Any Break World elite in Space Garden will be able to kill it.”

Bird Elder laughed. “We can have someone go into the bai sema beast’s belly, so they are smuggled into Space Garden.”
