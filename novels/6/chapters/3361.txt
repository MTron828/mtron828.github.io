Chapter 3362 Who is Human Alpha?

“Why must he kill Bao’er?” Han Sen wanted to figure out why this was the case.

The jade statue looked at Han Sen and said, “That doesn’t matter anymore. You just need to know that Human Alpha will not give up on Bao’er. If Bao’er does not have the gene seed, she cannot go against Human Alpha. No matter what, please deliver the gene seed to Bao’er for her to live.”

“Do not worry,” Han Sen said with a look certainty. “I will take this gene seed and put it in her hands. Plus, I will not allow anyone to bring harm to Bao’er, no matter who that person is.”

The jade statue shook her head and said, “You are already strong, but you cannot beat Human Alpha. Only Bao’er can once she receives the gene seed. In this universe, no one can do combat with Human Alpha and succeed. This is Bao’er’s destiny. Therefore, you must survive. Give the gene seed to Bao’er. Until then, you must hold on.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“In this universe, there are no absolutely invincible beings, right?” Han Sen asked. “I should be able to find a way to beat him. If I cannot do it alone, I can find other elites to help me. I will find a way.”

“Things are not that simple,” the jade statue said. “You do not understand Human Alpha, which is why you feel this way.” She then went silent. Not long after, she sighed and said, “If you really want to protect Bao’er, you have to bring her the gene seed. That is the best chance she has of surviving.”

Han Sen could see the God Chaos Party Leader was still refusing to divulge details on the grudge with Human Alpha and knew there was something about all of this she could not reveal. Ergo, he decided to stop asking her questions about it.

“I saw Bao’er enter the 33 skies, but I am not sure which sky she entered,” Han Sen said after looking at the jade statue. That was the biggest problem he was currently facing. If he could not find Bao’er, then everything up until now was all for nothing.

“Bao’er is in the 33 skies? That is bad. The geno tablet has already returned to its origin. If my real body was there, I could find her. Now, I am just a leftover remnant of a soul. I can’t do anything about it. The worst thing about all this is you and big sky demon suggesting Qin Xiu might be the Human Alpha, and his power is best to its best potential shape. If he sees Bao’er now, he might be able to recognize her.”

“As far as I know, Qin Xiu did not have many talents when he was young.” Han Sen asked with curiosity, “Could he be Human Alpha reborn?”

Although reincarnation likely erased the memories a spirit possessed, people who were as strong as Human Alpha would carry with them a strong gene message even if they reincarnated. He could not have reincarnated into garbage that could not practice.

If it was not for Qin Wan’er giving her blood to Qin Xiu, Qin Xiu would not have even been able to practice. Could a person like that really be who Human Alpha reincarnated as?

The jade statue said, “This is normal. Me and Bao’er’s father did something to the soul. Even if he reincarnated, he would have been restricted. He would not be able to pass the last stage. With his power, getting past the restrictions is only a matter of time. Perhaps in this life, he has already broken past the restrictions and become something more. If he can do that, he might be able to complete the final step. The only thing that can fight him is me and Bao’er’s father, and our genetic child, Bao’er.”

The God Chaos Party Leader sounded remarkably chill, but Han Sen could tell she was very proud of Bao’er.

“There cannot be just two genetics. Bao’er used my blood to be born, so her genes should have a part of me inside her.” Han Sen only thought that. He did not dare say it aloud.

The jade statue did not look at Han Sen. It did not feel anything weird. She thought about it for a while. She then looked at Han Sen and said, “Right now, our only hope of finding Bao’er is you.”

“How can I even do that?” Han Sen quickly asked.

“Your body has some of Bao’er’s genes. You can use a special method to activate the gene message you have because of your connection with Bao’er. You will be able to feel where she is. By doing this, you might have a big problem. You will have a lot of burdens in your body. It will mess up your own gene message. It might even change your gene message.” The jade statue was not planning on hiding these issues.

“If there is no other way, then I guess I will have to do it,” Han Sen said. “Plus, even if I can feel Bao’er, I cannot even go past the 33 skies’ barriers. I will be unable to find her.”

“Let me handle that for you,” the jade statue said. Her eyebrows looked a bit dewy as she said, “This will take the last bit of my power. After that, I will be gone forever. Bao’er will only have you to depend on.”

“Don’t worry. I told you I won’t let any harm come to Bao’er because she is my daughter just as much as yours.” Han Sen then thought of something. He decided to ask, “Are you the fairy of the White Jade Jing?”

The jade statue smiled and said, “The White Jade Jing was what I was born with.”

Although Han Sen could guess the God Chaos Party Leader was from the geno universe, he was still shocked hearing her voice confirm it.

In those endless years, there had been a person who managed to break the main and reverse universes and almost broke the ruling of the God Spirits in the reverse universe. That was something no other person had done before.

Han Sen wished to ask something, but the jade statue’s spirit light broke out of its body. It shot into Han Sen’s forehead. It resulted in a voice playing into Han Sen’s ears. “There is nothing more I can give you, but I do believe you will do all in your power to help Bao’er. Now, the only person I can put my faith in is you. Before you accomplish what you need to, you must be careful. Deliver the gene seed to Bao’er. If you see one black and one white geno prototypes combined, that person is the Human Alpha. If the geno prototype is not on his body, that means he has already managed to break the restrictions. You and Bao’er must be more careful than ever.”

After that, the spirit light went into Han Sen’s forehead. Han Sen felt as if there was some really clear power coming into his brain. His body was like an erupting volcano, and he was melting in its midst. All of his cells became steel juice.

“Two geno prototypes, one and one white, combined.” Han Sen’s brain kept thinking about the God Chaos Party Leader’s final words. He also felt compelled to think about the Ultimate Egg. “Is Wu Wei Dao Alpha also Human Alpha? Did God Chaos Party Leader create the Ultimate Egg and leave it for him and his soul?”

Time did not permit Han Sen to think about all of that for too long. The God Chaos Party Leader’s spirit power was like a firework in a barrel of fireworks. Han Sen’s gene messages exploded, and a part of his gene messages was reinforced.
