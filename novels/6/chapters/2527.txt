Chapter 2528: Very High Sense?

Li Keer decided not to help Han Sen, as he wasn’t in any grave danger just yet. She did raise an eyebrow as she watched him, though. “What is up with this guy? Why is he strong like a god one minute, and he behaves like a wimp the next?”

Li Keer couldn’t wrap her mind around what he was doing, and she noticed how annoyed the wolf god was starting to look. It looked up and howled to the sky. Its body became blurry, then exploded in a misty haze. Many carbon copies of the wolf god came racing out of that mist. In a second, a dozen other wolf gods emerged in all their angry glory. They were in the sky, on the ground, in front of Han Sen and behind him. They surrounded him, preventing his escape from every direction.

“Doppelganger? No... these clones must have at least eighty percent of the original wolf’s power.” Han Sen glanced around at the wolf gods, impressed.

Han Sen’s Moon Doppelganger skill exuded power that could take on a solid shape and little more. He couldn’t use the skill to fight.

But this wolf god’s doppelgangers were different. Each duplicate was its own individual creature, and each one had nearly enough power to rival the original wolf god. Each one could move on its own accord, too.

This was the first time Han Sen had seen a doppelganger talent like this.

Before Han Sen could organize his thoughts, the doppelgangers came at him. All of them were shockingly fast. They were only a tiny bit slower than the wolf god itself.

Han Sen used his Dongxuan Movement to the max. He employed formations, snap judgments, and movement skills. All of his evasive talents were firing on all cylinders. Amidst all of the attacks of the wolf god’s doppelgangers, Han Sen was like a dancing butterfly. The dozen wolf god doppelgangers were unable to do a thing to their foe. They couldn’t harm Han Sen.

After the wolf god brought out its doppelgangers, Li Keer wondered if she should help Han Sen. After all, she hadn’t seen the battle that she wanted and expected. If she helped now, it might only end up doing him a favor.

But as Li Keer watched Han Sen use his skills to kite all those foes, she froze. Han Sen’s movements seemed almost effortless as he led his enemies around by the nose.

“How... how is that possible? Isn’t this the Very High Sense’s Sky and Being Combination? Impossible. How can another race have the skills of the Very High? And how can someone else have the Sky and Being Combination? How can he push it to such an extreme?” Li Keer’s face was blank. She was watching Han Sen dance through the pack of wolves, but she could barely believe her own eyes.

“No, this isn’t the Very High’s Sky and Being Combination, but it is something very similar. It is almost the same thing, but it is different. It is like the Sky’s Textless Book, but it is different from that as well... This is so weird... What kind of geno art is this? Is there some ancient, scary undead being that has made a geno art similar to the Very High Sense?” Li Keer’s face kept changing. She looked very confused.

She thought rapidly, but she couldn’t come up with the name of any geno art that was remotely similar to the Very High Sense. Aside from the Sky’s Textless Book, that is. Although other races had similar geno arts, they were only superficially reminiscent of the Very High Sense.

The abilities Han Sen was using weren’t weak or superficial at all. Li Keer could see that her movements and abilities weren’t as good as Dollar’s.

“What is going on? Is Dollar one of the Very High? Or is he one of the Sky? From what I know, in this generation, the Sky only taught the Textless Book to Lone Bamboo. Yu Shanxin practiced the Textless Book, but he didn’t learn it very well. He forged his own path. Dollar can’t be one of those two. And besides, when Dollar was in the Geno Being Scroll, he fought against Lone Bamboo. So, they cannot be the same person...” Li Keer was so confused. She didn’t understand anything she was seeing.

Even if Li Keer thought until her brain exploded, she ever would have imagined that Han Sen’s geno arts were a product of a completely different universe. What she was seeing were skills created by the human Xuanmen, after many generations of research.

Although the Dongxuan Sutra wasn’t the Very High Sense, some elements made them quite similar. The two of them alike in execution, although they had been developed in different directions. Beneath the surface, the two skills worked very differently. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Plus, each skill could be used in a number of different ways. It would be hard to tell which might be stronger and which might be weaker.

The Very High Sense was the product of many Very High elites’ research. It was the best geno art in the geno universe, and it had been for a very long time.

The Dongxuan Sutra was also the very best in the sanctuaries. It wasn’t complete in its development outside the sanctuaries, however. It needed a lot more practice before it was finished. Compared to the Very High Sense, the Dongxuan Sutra was like a prototype geno art in its early stages of learning.

Until the Dongxuan Sutra was finished, no one would be able to tell whether it or the Very High Sense was stronger. There was only one thing that was certain right now, however; Li Keer was weaker than Han Sen.

As Li Keer watched Han Sen, her face kept changing. For the longest time, her gaze never flickered from his form.

She had thought she would save Han Sen when he was in danger, but that no longer seemed necessary. Han Sen had maxed out a skill similar to Sky and Being Combination. The wolf god doppelgangers weren’t dangerous enough to put his life at risk. It would be pointless for Li Keer to participate.

But that made Li Keer more curious. Her pretty eyes were looking brighter than ever. “Who is Dollar? What geno arts is he using?”

Han Sen was fighting against the wolf god doppelgangers, and through observation, he noticed something quite interesting. After the wolf god used doppelgangers, although the doppelgangers had a power that was similar to that of the original wolf god, they didn’t have one hundred percent of the wolf god’s power.

“Does that mean the wolf god’s doppelganger skills are split from its true self? Are they something more than just doppelgangers?” Han Sen was happy.

The doppelgangers of the wolf god were very powerful, but as a threat to Han Sen, they weren’t as dangerous as the wolf god focusing all its power into one body.

Group fights were what Han Sen feared the least. Plus, the Dongxuan Armor provided Han Sen an endless amount of energy. He didn’t have to worry about power conservation. It didn’t matter how many times the doppelgangers tried to surround him, they couldn’t harm Han Sen.

“It is a shame I don’t have the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger. Otherwise, perhaps I wouldn’t even need the Gold Armor General to kill the wolf god.” Han Sen didn’t use the Thunder God Spike. Even if he struck with that weapon, he would only paralyze the wolf god doppelgangers. He couldn’t use the spike to break the wolf god’s body.

The Thunder God Spike and the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger were deified treasures. One was a thunder element, whereas the other focused on destructive powers. So, the Thunder God Spike could paralyze the wolf god without breaking its body. The Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger had a chance to break the bodies of deified xenogeneics. It didn’t have the power to paralyze them, however.

It was impossible to say which of the two was stronger. Their uses were different. But now, Han Sen was more in need of the dragon tooth’s destructive power.
