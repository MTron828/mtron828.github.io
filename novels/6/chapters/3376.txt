Chapter 3377 God Descends

“Human Alpha was very proud back in the day. He wanted to use his body to accomplish that final step, so that was why he created The Story of Genes.” Chaos laughed and went on to say, “It is a shame that The Story of Genes was just a theory. It did not actually happen. No one was able to practice it. Not even Human Alpha himself.”

“Through the aid of the geno prototype’s armor, wasn’t I able to practice with The Story of Genes?” Han Sen asked because he was curious about it.

Chaos shook her head. “The Story of Genes includes a line of every gene in the universe. My geno prototype’s power was able to make your body’s requirement sufficient enough to practice The Story of Genes, but that was just at the lowest possible requirement. The Story of Genes still requires your own genes when it comes to making the final step. That doesn’t just apply to you. Even Qin Xiu, who has the geno prototype armor, cannot do it.”

“Fine. It is almost time. We must hurry up and help Bao’er combine with the super gene seed. I am going to need your help.” Chaos pointed at Han Sen’s chest and said, “Your body has half of the super gene, so it should be able to help Bao’er.

“Do you mean the Ultimate Egg?” Han Sen was shocked. He now understood what Chaos meant.

“That is not an Ultimate Egg,” Chaos said. “It is a product of me and Bao’er’s father’s genes. The two of our genes combined to form this super gene’s half-completion with the knowledge that it could be used to suppress Human Alpha. Back in the day, it was a half-complete super gene, but there were too many flaws. There was no effective way of improving it. Using it to help Bao’er evolve her own super gene seed should be fine.”

“Are you saying this Ultimate Egg is for suppressing Human Alpha?” Han Sen asked. “From what I know, the Ultimate Egg belonged to the Wu Wei Dao Alpha.”

“The Wu Wei Dao Alpha you mention is the after-life of the Human Alpha,” Chaos said with certainty. “It was the life in which the Ultimate Egg became free. If I have guessed correctly, after the Wu Wei Dao Alpha was reborn, Qin Xiu came into existence.”

Han Sen knew for sure that Human Alpha, the Wu Wei Dao Alpha, and Qin Xiu were the same person.

It was kind of funny that Qin Xiu was the Wu Wei Dao Alpha, but the Qin Kingdom was a kingdom that did not support the Wu Wei Dao Palace. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Chaos was not in much of a mood to explain too many things. She just went ahead to try and teach Bao’er how to use the super gene seed. It was the gourd vine.

In fact, only Bao’er was able to use that gourd vine. When her genes grew up with the gourd vines, the gourd vines hurried the evolution of Bao’er’s genes.

The two of them helped out each other. They both required each other.

Chaos helped Han Sen recover quickly. She then taught him a way to control the Ultimate Egg. She let Han Sen control the Ultimate Egg. When Han Sen was able to control the Ultimate Egg, he was able to use the Ultimate Egg to recharge Bao’er’s power.

Controlling the Ultimate Egg was not easy. Although the Ultimate Egg was just a failed result of making the super genes, its power was already fairly close.

Han Sen tried it many times, but he was only able to learn a bit of skill through it. Every day, he used the Ultimate Egg’s power to rinse Bao’er, hoping Bao’er and the gourd would be able to evolve faster.

After the fighting in the 33 skies, Qin Xiu did not show up again. The God Chaos Party’s battle with the God Spirits had only just begun, and the 33 skies were to be used as a battleground. Many God Chaos Party Break World beasts battled the God Spirits for a leadership position.

In the 33 skies, 23 of the skies had a master. God Chaos Party had one-third of them while the God Spirits managed to claim another one-third for themselves. The last one-third was taken by other powerful creatures.

The geno universe and universe of kingdoms were both in chaos. Break World beasts were everywhere. Many elites had been created.

That was especially true in Space Garden. Many humans, spirits, and creatures were able to break the world. Even in the middle of that chaotic environment, humans were still able to adapt, overcome, and keep a hold of their Space Garden home.

Han Sen was in Space Garden. He killed a Break World beast and put a Break World gene in his belly.

“Break World genes plus one.”

Han Sen’s Break World genes tally had reached 97 or something. Recently, killing Break World beasts to earn Break World genes had become very difficult. Eating one Break World gene was only able to increase his Break World gene tally by one.

Even so, there were too many Break World beasts. Han Sen’s Break World genes had almost managed to max out by this point.

Recently, Qin Xiu had not been all that active. So, Han Sen rinsed Bao’er every day before going into the geno universe to hunt more Break World beasts. Although Chaos said only Bao’er was the one who could fight Qin Xiu, Han Sen did not agree with that belief. If it was possible, he did not want Bao’er to be the one at risk. He did not think it was right to put so many responsibilities on one child.

“The Story of Genes, Jadeskin, Dongxuan Sutra, Blood-Pulse Sutra...” While Han Sen was resting, he thought about all these skills all over again.

“The geno prototype armor has a power that stems from the origin of the universe. All the gene lines are in there. No matter how strong my power is, it still comes from somewhere in the universe’s base. I will not be able to break the geno prototype’s armor. So, how do I break through and gain a power that resides outside existence as we know it?” Han Sen had been thinking about this issue a lot.

Han Sen knew that this would not be easy. The Ultimate Egg was such a massive power, but it had failed to ascend and go beyond the rules. It was a failure.

Qin Xiu was very strong, yet he failed to make the last step. In the end, he was going to use the geno prototype armor to do it.

Bao’er had the God Chaos Party Leader and the last good gene from the God Hall Leader, but she still needed to combine with the super gene seed to make the final step.

“Does this mean there is no way to use your own power for making that last step?” Han Sen asked himself.

“When I and Wan’er combined, I did feel that restriction. Now, Wan’er is gone, but my power might not have to go through the next step.” Han Sen was not someone who gave up easily. Although many people had told him Bao’er was the only one able to make the final step, he did not want to give up. He did not want to wait for Bao’er to solve the issue.

While Han Sen was thinking, a shadow was approaching. It was the Geno Hall Leader, God.

“You look like you are in trouble,” God said with a laugh.

“Thank you for saving us.” Han Sen knew Moment God and the others most likely joined because of him.

God shook his head. “I did not do that for you. I am merely saving myself. If Qin Xiu killed Bao’er, then no one in this world would be able to stand against him.”

“Han Sen looked at God and asked, “Including you?”

God seriously said, “Yes. Including me.”

“Is Qin Xiu really that strong? Can’t a Reboot power stop him?” Han Sen asked with a frown.

Of course, the God Chaos Party Leader was very strong, but she would still have to fall to the whims of the rebooting powers. Why could it not be used against Qin Xiu? It was something that confused Han Sen.

“Did Chaos not tell you that Qin Xiu has the genes of a Reboot-class God Spirit?” What God said surprised Han Sen.
