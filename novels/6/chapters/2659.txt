2660 Physiognomy

“I guess I’m on my own.” Han Sen looked around. He saw a star fruit that looked fairly pretty, and so he flew up to it.

“This fruit is very puffed and full. It does seem very rich. It is obviously a sign of happiness. It must surely have generated a deified xenogeneic.” Those who studied physiognomy believed they could judge the personality of a person merely by studying that person’s facial features. Han Sen attempted to apply the same principle to the fruit, running his hands over its surface.

“Ha! Are you trying to read the fruit’s physiognomy?” Exquisite couldn’t help but laugh. The Very High had physiognomy skills, as well. But they had never thought about trying something like that on a star fruit, of all things.

“Humans have faces. Fruits have faces, too. If humans can receive physiognomies, then why can’t fruit have a physiognomy?” Han Sen replied in a dignified manner.

He actually didn’t understand physiognomy; he had merely seen a reference to it in the texts of the Xuan Men. Han Sen had barely glanced over the topic. He couldn’t even be called a beginner. He couldn’t actually read the face of a human, let alone of a fruit.

Right now, he just needed something to reassure him that he wasn’t making another blind choice. He desperately hoped to receive a deified xenogeneic.

But God didn’t give people what they wanted very often, and Han Sen had thus far only been able to receive King class xenogeneics. He had selected many fruits, but they all turned out to be Kings. He could only use them for grunt work. So, overall, they wouldn’t be very useful.

After choosing more fruit, Han Sen realized he only had two left. Upset by his disappointing results, he grabbed the two nearest to him and slammed them down.

Bao’er was useless now. Han Sen could only depend on his own luck, and that wasn’t working out well for him.

The two fruits dissolved quickly, revealing the xenogeneics inside them.

One of them was a wolf. Han Sen immediately recognized that its presence was King class, but the other one made him quite happy for a change.

It was a rock giant. It was in a sitting position, holding its knees. It was ten meters tall, and its body was entirely composed of black rock. It seemed to radiate strength. It looked like a little mountain, in many ways.

“A deified xenogeneic, can you believe it? Finally, I have received a deified xenogeneic.” Feeling the mammoth presence of the rock giant, Han Sen was thrilled.

Exquisite felt relieved. One deified xenogeneic out of 50 fruits was an ordinary shake of luck. While the rock giant was still sleeping, Han Sen quickly signed a contract with it. Outer Sky was full of deified creatures, and having a deified fighter by his side would make life much easier for Han Sen.

Especially if he wanted to kill star beetles in the future, having a deified xenogeneic to help would save him a lot of trouble.

Han Sen brought his group of xenogeneics over to the old man. The old man didn’t say much. When his gaze passed over the little pigs around Bao’er, he seemed surprised.

“Uncle, I wonder what these little pigs are. Why did xenogeneics that are so similar come out of so many fruit?” Exquisite asked.

“The star tree is a true god plant,” the old man said simply. “It possesses the energy of the universe. It isn’t something that I fully understand. It has its reasons for existing, however.”

After that, the old man brought out another item to present to Han Sen.

“This is my token. You need to use it when you clear out beetles in the future. Every ten days, come back and take care of the star tree. Whenever a swarm of bugs arrives, you must make sure that you clear out each and every one. None of them can be allowed to live.”

Han Sen bowed and accepted the item. It was a small stick. It was aqua colored, and it looked like it was made from jade.

The item had a very strong presence. It looked like a deified treasure.

Han Sen hadn’t expected to receive a powerful item out of this deal, but he quickly took the jade stick and bowed before the old man. “Do not worry, uncle. I will do my best to take care of the star tree until you return.”

“You may leave now. Come back again in 10 days,” the old man said dismissively.

Bao’er and Exquisite joined Han Sen as he turned to depart, but Exquisite was unable to teleport so many creatures with her. Even if she had used her small ship, there wouldn’t have been enough room for all of those xenogeneics.

So, for now, Han Sen left the creatures there. He would be returning to the tree in 10 days, anyway.

Bao’er’s small pigs were only a fist-size, so transporting them wasn’t difficult. Han Sen pulled out a bag and stuffed all of the pigs inside it. He carried them to the small ship.

“You should let them out. They won’t take up much space, anyway,” Exquisite said. She could see the pigs writhing around in the bag in an obvious state of discomfort.

Han Sen realized that she was right. He released the little pigs and allowed them all to happily run toward Bao’er, who was standing in the front of the ship. Altogether, they watched the majestic scenery go by.

“Do you want to go back to Underworld Lake, or would you rather hunt some xenogeneics?” Exquisite asked Han Sen as both of them rested in the back of the ship. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Let’s go back to Underworld Lake. I think it will be safer if I practice more with God’s Wander before I begin hunting xenogeneics,” Han Sen said.

“Sure.” Exquisite nodded and delivered Han Sen to Underworld Lake.

Unless someone had space teleportation, they would have to use a ship like Exquisite’s to travel around Outer Sky. The ship had a special power buff that deterred the creatures in Outer Sky from attempting to break it. Not even deified elites could travel through Outer Sky on foot without trouble. And Han Sen wasn’t even deified yet.

So, Han Sen wanted to practice space teleportation so he could travel around Outer Sky with greater ease. He didn’t plan on hunting down xenogeneics yet.

And of course, Han Sen also wanted to fish-up the rest of the yellow papers he had been in the process of collecting. That was the main reason he had asked her to take him to Underworld Lake rather than the wooden house.

Exquisite could feel what Han Sen was thinking, and it made her blush. She thought Han Sen wanted to see more of the pictures on the yellow papers. She didn’t know the yellow papers actually seemed to represent some sort of geno art.

They soon arrived back on the shores of Underworld Lake, but this time, Exquisite didn’t leave. Instead, she remained to fish alongside him. That was quite frustrating.

With Exquisite there, he had to control his thoughts. And that was no easy task. Even Han Sen struggled to keep his thoughts in check.

Han Sen enjoyed practicing his geno arts, and Exquisite got to experience everything that he learned as well. Although Exquisite had already learned God’s Wander, watching Han Sen practice allowed her to learn some new things at times.

But Exquisite was caught off guard by Han Sen’s fishing success. Before she pulled out a single thing, Han Sen had already managed to reel in a few items.

But Han Sen only seemed to be retrieving those yellow papers. Whenever Han Sen looked at them, she could feel it. And every time he did, her face blushed.

Bao’er was now close friends with the small pigs, and she played with them nearby as Han Sen and Exquisite fished. The pigs kept Bao’er occupied; otherwise, she would have been bored out of her mind. The little pigs continued to look passive, and they didn’t exhibit an ounce of aggression. While they made for nice pets, they were useless. Han Sen felt a little disheartened every time he looked at them.

After a few days, Han Sen couldn’t stand being watched by Exquisite anymore. So, he told her that he wanted to go to the core area.

But Exquisite told him that Outer Sky was between the real world and the anti-material world. Due to the presence of space barriers, he couldn’t enter the core area.

Han Sen tried it anyway, and he really couldn’t enter the core hall’s door anymore.
