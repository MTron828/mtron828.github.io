Chapter 3171 Absorbing a Gene Skill

The gold wing peacock king swallowed the sonic god bird’s body. The gold light glowed even stronger. The peacock opened its beak and made some bird sounds in Zhong Miao Yin’s direction.

Suddenly, shaky shockwaves were felt throughout the place. It was the sonic god bird’s shaky shockwave from moments before.

Han Sen was shocked. Other people might have thought the gold wing peacock king already knew sonic shockwave, but he knew that none of the gold wing peacock’s three gene skills were a sonic element. Thus, it was impossible for it to be using the shaky shockwave.

Zhong Miao Yin quickly gathered up power and fought the shaky shockwave. Fortunately, she always used the shaky shockwave. She was very familiar with it, so she knew how to break it.

“Stop!” Zhong Miao Yin shouted one word and some invisible, godly power made the shaky shockwave stop nine feet away from her.

Seeing her appear so powerful, Zhong Miao Yin’s fans swooned with happiness. Many of them screamed out their support at the top of their lungs.

Zhong Miao Yin was just as much shocked as they were. Her shouting involved the demon sound beast gene combination skill demon sound seal. The demon sound seal was able to restrict the sonic god bird’s shaky shockwaves. The demon sound beast and sonic god bird had practiced the sonic sound seal before. She discovered it was able to stop the shaky shockwave.

This time, the demon sound seal only protected her in a nine-foot bubble. It had been unable to stop the shaky shockwave completely. It proved to her that the gold wing peacock king’s shaky shockwave was stronger than the sonic god bird’s version.

Zhong Miao Yin was shocked. She saw the wings on the gold wing peacock’s back spread. It had become a gold peacock shield. It released 10,000 gold lights. It resulted in a sky full of arrows that came violently raining down on Zhong Miao Yin.

Zhong Miao Yin had a hard time blocking the shaky shockwave. She did not have any more powers to block the scary, sky full of arrows. Although she felt bad about doing it, she had no choice but to concede and depart the space battleground. Thus, she escaped the crisis of being turned into a hedgehog.

“Oh, my God! He used a gene race to beat Zhong Miao Yin, one of the three big singers.”

“What was that gene race? That was too scary.” “I don’t know who the owner of the gene race is. Is one gene race really that powerful? If the owner went and fought, I wonder how powerful such a combo would be.”

Everyone went to look at who Zhong Miao Yin’s opponent was. When they saw who it was, they were very surprised. Obviously, the name Lucky was an alias, but the title God of Wealth was nothing false. Yet, none of them had heard of a god being this strong before.

When the Yan Kingdom’s people saw God of Wealth’s name again, they were given a fright. “How is this God of Wealth and its members so powerful? Earlier, Dollar had used one skill to defeat the Flying Yan Swordsman. This time, Lucky only sent out a gene race to defeat Zhong Miao Yin, one of the three big singers of the Qin Kingdom.”

“What is this God Spirit called God of Wealth?”

“I want to go to God of Wealth Temple to have a look.”

Along with the Yan Kingdom’s people, many other people were starting to pay attention to the God Spirit known as God of Wealth. After the list was investigated, they learned there were three members of God of Wealth taking part in the god fights. One of them was called Dollar. He was the one who had knocked out Yan Bei Fei.

Ingot and Lucky had been winning too. No one had been able to stop them. What was particularly scary about them was that they had not revealed themselves in the battlegrounds. They had beaten all of their challengers by merely using their gene races. Many people paid attention to the God of Wealth, Dollar, and the others. Han Sen did not know anything about it. Even if he did know of the traction he was garnering, he wouldn’t have cared.

Han Sen was busy investigating the gold wing peacock king. It now the shaky sonic shockwave in its skillset. It had obviously come from the sonic god bird.

“The gold wing peacock king now how this kind of power. So, does all it have to do is consume another gene race to get another gene skill? If it eats a lot of gene races, it will earn many.” Han Sen knew Bai Mo would not put any ordinary gene egg inside that mystery stove.

Back in the day, Bai Mo accepted a quest from Qin Xiu to find a way to revive Qin Wan’er. He had discovered the black crystal stone and the stone stove that possessed The Story of Genes from an old tribe. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qin Xiu had taken the black crystal stone to the geno universe. Bai Mo had investigated the stone stove.

Bai Mo died a very long time ago, but the gold wing peacock king’s eggs were burning in the stone stove day and night until Han Sen found it and hatched it.

Although the gold wing peacock king was already a top-class gene race, Han Sen always wondered if it was a mutant god-class gene egg. He did not think Bai Mo cherished it that much.

Judging from Bai Mo’s identity, he might have hidden a gene egg there. But inside the stone stove, it was the gold wing peacock king.

“It looks like there is more than meets the eye with this gold wing peacock king.” Han Sen had no idea what use the gold wing peacock king had. He had waited a long time to see its true potential.

There was one thing known for sure. The gold wing peacock king was able to keep eating gene races to evolve and develop its skillset. Regarding the direction it could evolve into, whether it would end up as a God Spirit or a gene race, Han Sen could not accurately predict the outcome.

Han Sen and the other two from the God of Wealth kept fighting and kept winning. They were unstoppable. It was only a matter of time before they breached the top 100. God of Wealth and the three aliases they used were already being discussed across the seven kingdoms.

The nobles of the seven kingdoms fervently debated what level of God Spirit the God of Wealth was and how its agents were so strong. They wondered about the true identity of Dollar, Lucky, and Ingot too. People like that were definitely not nobodies. Feng Fei Fei sadly returned to the Feng family castle. She wanted to perform well, but she had suffered bad luck. She encountered a powerful elite, so she just fell short of the top 100.

Feng Fei Fei was not too disappointed. She rushed back to the Feng family castle, wanting to ask if Feng Yin Yin had heard about Dollar, Lucky, and Ingot.

Feng Fei Fei wanted to know who the consuming god was as well as who those three people were.

There were no matches that day, so Feng Yin Yin had remained home. When Feng Fei Fei kept asking her, Feng Yin Yin replied, “Are you asking about those three people? Of course, I know them.”

“Who are they?” Feng Fei Fei curiously asked.

“It is San Mu, Bao’er, and me.” Feng Yin Yin pointed at her nose as she answered.

“What? It’s you guys. Which one are you?” Feng Fei Fei looked at Feng Yin Yin strangely.

“My nickname is Lucky.” Feng Yin Yin was being honest.

Feng Fei Fei looked at Feng Yin Yin as she asked, “Where did you get the powerful peacock gene race?” She looked super weirded out.

“San Mu let me borrow it,” Feng Yin Yin replied.

Feng Fei Fei’s expression looked even more strange. She did not say anything. On the inside, her heart struggled. She thought, “Han Sen and Little Yin are not related, yet he treats Little Yin very well. Is he hitting on Little Yin? But Little Yin is just a kid. How could he...”
