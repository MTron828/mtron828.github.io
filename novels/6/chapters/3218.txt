Chapter 3219 Dust Sky

One sky. One world. Han Sen went through nine skies without seeing anyone from the God Chaos Party. “They’ve even cleared out nine entire skies. It looks like God Chaos Party has been really busy these past few years.” Han Sen kept on rushing. He used this chance to see how many skies God Chaos Party had actually opened. It was not because of God Hall Leader giving him benefits. Han Sen just wanted to know how much progress God Chaos Party had made with this endeavor of theirs.

If the God Chaos Party had really opened 33 skies, then he could use the final part of the path to access the geno universe. He would not have to use the God of Wealth Temple to enter the geno universe for a few meager days.

If the geno universe was broken through by this enemy, it might not bode well for the geno universe.

The geno universe and universe of kingdoms should have been equal, but they were still two separate worlds. The thing about the geno universe was that it did not have many Break World elites. Han Sen had never seen any such people before.

Even if their power was as good as a Break World elite, they did not have the capacity to break the world.

It was like the Sky Palace Leader’s existence. No matter the talent or power or level of someone, they were not weaker than the elites of the universe of kingdoms. Yet, they still could not break the world.

Why the geno universe’s break world elites found breaking the world so hard was something Han Sen had thought about in the past. He thought the universe of kingdoms had so many Break World elites because the God Chaos Party fought the God Spirits. In the end, it made the last God Hall Leader reboot the universe of kingdoms. It made the universe of kingdoms have many flaws in its fabric. With all those flaws, it made breaking the world far easier.

The geno universe was not the main battleground. It was just affected a little as a result. The rules of that universe were not as bad as the rules of the other universe that had been destroyed. So, it was hard to break the world in the geno universe.

When Han Sen reached the tenth sky, he saw humans again. The tenth sky had many planets around. It was like a mini-universe of kingdoms.

Humans were living there peacefully. Han Sen noticed many of the humans on many of the different planets were still in a primal age. Some planets were in an interstellar era though. There were lots of giant battleships traveling through space.

“This cannot be an illusion again, can it?” Han Sen frowned. With his Dongxuan Sutra’s sensing power, he felt as if the humans were real and living things. He did not detect them to be illusions like Shadow God had constructed.

The humans there were very strange. Even though they did not have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse or gene race power, their power was very weak. It was like they were normal humans who did not practice inside the sanctuaries.

Han Sen’s expression quickly changed. He felt his own power weaken incredibly fast. His Dongxuan Sutra’s aura radius could reach a few systems away, but it was suddenly shrunk to a level that did not even allow him to scan a single planet.

It was not just his Dongxuan Sutra that had been affected this way. Every power in his body was like that too. The scariest thing about it was how it looked like Wan’er was affected as well. Her power had been weakened. He could determine that from her god flames, which had started to weaken.

“Why are things like that here? Whose power is it?” Han Sen looked terrible. He turned around and wanted to leave the tenth sky. Even Wan’er’s reverse Super God Spirit mode was affected. This power was too scary.

When Han Sen established a direction to get through the tenth sky, he saw a very powerful and overbearing king-like man standing at the exit of the tenth sky. Han Sen looked at him.

“This is not a power anyone can have,” the man coldly said. “This is the ruling power of Dust Sky. No creature can use its powers here, not even God Spirits. If they come here, they will become ordinary creatures that have no powers.”

“Who are you?” Han Sen felt as if his body’s power had been reduced. At the rate his power was leaving his body, he was going to be reduced to an ordinary man who could not even wrestle a chicken within half an hour.

“I am God Chaos Party’s leader, Bury Path God,” the man coldly said.

Han Sen could have guessed that a bit already. Upon hearing the man say it, he was not surprised. He just kept dodging Wan’er’s attack while looking at Bury Path God.

Han Sen could not see any power moving through the man. He looked something like a commoner, but Han Sen did not actually believe he was a commoner.

Although this place was Dust Sky, the power there could reduce any creature into a commoner. At the same time, it was a nest for the God Chaos Party. This was God Chaos Party’s leader. Han Sen did not believe he had what it took to fight Dust Sky’s power.

If he was unable to block the power of Dust Sky, Han Sen didn’t think he would have shown up there.

“I must get out of this place before my power is totally ground away by the powers of Dust Sky.” Han Sen’s body flashed. His eyes looked bright. His body suddenly went to Bury Path God. At the same time, he wielded his Inch Grey Sword and unleashed the biggest attack he could at Bury Path God.

Because of Han Sen’s plan, Wan’er’s gold light slashed toward Bury Path God too.

Han Sen thought, “Even though my and Wan’er’s power has been reduced a lot if I only need him to expose his flaws and enable my escape from Dust Sky, it should be fine. After all, Wan’er’s reverse Super God Spirit mode has been weakened but is still very strong.”

Han Sen did not dare underestimate this temporary leader. Although he was only filling in for the real leader, he was still an elite who had challenged the entire God Spirit system.

Seeing Wan’er and Han Sen attack at the same time, Bury Path God did not look as if he was going to dodge. He was like an unmoving mountain. The moment the Inch Grey Sword and gold light were going to hit him, his hand finally moved.

Two of his fingers held onto Han Sen’s Inch Grey Sword. The other hand held Wan’er’s hand, which was slashing down. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Han Sen suddenly felt as if his Inch Grey Sword had been grabbed by a pincer. He tried his best, but he could not make the Inch Grey Sword budge an inch.

“If this was another place, even the leader would not have an easy time fighting you,” Bury Path God said as his hands employed some sort of power that blasted Han Sen and Wan’er backward. “But this is Dust Sky. Your power has been turned into dust. You cannot fight me, who is the temporary leader. You should just go and talk to our leader.”

Han Sen knew the situation he was in was very bad. His power had devolved to about 20% or even less. If he did not find a way to escape that realm soon, he might find himself captured by the God Chaos Party. If that were to happen, it wouldn’t be a happy ending. Han Sen’s eyes kept flickering. Black and white power kept spinning weirdly. The Dongxuan Sutra was running like crazy. Dust Sky’s most basic structure appeared in his eyes.

He was not someone who loved to waste time and wallow in regret. Besides, now was not the time for regret. He had to find a way to destroy the Dust Sky power before all of his power was depleted. If he did not do that, he and Wan’er would have disaster fall upon them.

Because of that hit earlier, Wan’er stopped going after Han Sen. Her body flashed with gold light. She went to fight Bury Path God, who had struck her.
