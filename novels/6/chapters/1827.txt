1828 The Two That Did Not Come Ou

Yisha pursued an investigation of The Story of Genes. Revising something so complicated was difficult, and could even yield dangerous results. But if no changes were made to it, learning it would be too hard.

Raising Han Sen to Duke level would be easy, and the resource costs would not be too hefty. But The Story of Genes made things far more complicated than she had anticipated. And raising Han Sen to Duke had been far more expensive than she expected.

There was nobody around, except for a few guards outside the tunnel’s entrance.

But Narrow Moon had a lot of people watching the exit, and that included the Kings. They wanted to know more about the student Knife Queen had accepted. They wanted to know what made him so impressive that Queen herself would raise him.

They were different from the ordinary Rebate. They did not believe Knife Queen would spend so much time and resources on some random noob. They were guessing Knife Queen wanted Han Sen’s deified feather. And although one deified feather could not make you deified, it had deified genes. It could still help semi-deify an elite.

“Look at the time! They should almost be out by now.” Inside the garden, one Rebate King was looking at the exit, talking to himself.

The black vortex flashed suddenly, and someone came out. The Rebate who were watching the exit looked shocked, seeing this person.

“Why is it Gauss?” Everyone was surprised.

Of the ten Barons that had entered, Gauss should have placed much higher. He could have been in the top five, or even the top three. But for someone like him to be the first one out, it was quite the surprise.

Everyone looked at the weapon Gauss had taken. It was the pirate knife. Its power had been unleashed as it left the tunnel. And the Nobles could see that it was a Viscount weapon.

“Just a Viscount?” Many people were disappointed by Gauss’ performance. Especially the one who had recommended him. “You are injured! You need healing.” The guards saw Gauss’ neck wounds.

Many of the elites felt as if something was amiss. The seventh knife rain should be happening about now. Gauss had a Viscount weapon, and he could have lasted another two rounds. There had to be a reason why he had come out now.

Everyone looked at Gauss’ wounds, and when they saw them, they were all in shock.

Obviously, the cuts had been created by Teeth Knife. They were not infected by the Teeth power, but you could tell they had been created by the Teeth Knife’s Tusk component.

“Gauss was injured by Han Sen!” Everyone was taken aback.

Out of the ten Barons inside, it was likely Han Sen was the only one that knew about Teeth Knife. It could only have been Han Sen who had hurt him.

A King that was sitting in the hall, watching the tunnel, looked strangely at the scene. “It looks like the outsider students are not simple.”

“If he had struck any deeper, Gauss would be dead! No Baron should have the control and skill to be this precise! How long have you been teaching him?” Moon-Wheel King frowned.

Even Yisha looked shocked, seeing the wounds on Gauss’ neck.

She had taught Han Sen only once, for a few days. Han Sen had used Tusk to defeat Gauss, but at the same time spare his life. Her student was better than she believed him to be.

“Just a few days, and he is capable of this? Is he really that talented?” Yisha thought to herself.

As time passed, more and more Barons emerged. Han Sen was not amongst the ones that exited.

“It’s the tenth rain and they still haven’t come out?” Moon-Wheel King frowned.

It wasn’t just Moon-Wheel King who was this surprised, either. Other Kings and Nobles were still surprised to see that Han Sen had not yet come out.

If he hadn’t died in there, it was interesting to consider the prospects of why he had not yet returned.

“I am sorry Dark-Moon King... I have disappointed you.” In the hall, Gauss kowtowed before a King and looked very embarrassed.

“Han Sen hurt you?” Dark-Moon King said coldly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Yes.” Gauss did not dare to lie.

“Tell me what happened, and don’t skip a single detail. No lying,” Dark-Moon King said. He looked fairly calm.

Gauss’ body shook as he explained what had happened.

Dark-Moon King frowned upon hearing the story. “Just one hit? Knife Queen really put everything into that outsider.”

The rumors about Black Steel killing an outsider began to propagate, but no one spoke a word about it. Even the elders that had recommended the outsider did not comment on it.

He had said something he was not supposed to, and Black Steel killed him for it. He had it coming. If Knife Queen heard what he had said, his fate would have been far worse.

Everyone wondered why Han Sen and Black Steel still hadn’t come out. Seven of them had exited, and only those two were still living inside there.

“If they haven’t come out, then that means they managed to make it through the eleventh round. If they are lucky enough, they might be able to find a Duke weapon.” Yisha smiled. Han Sen’s performance far exceeded her modest expectations.

With Han Sen’s performance, if she wanted to invest in him, she’d undoubtedly take less pressure for the decision. Black- Moon King was also happy that Black Steek was still going on. The other Kings and elders felt differently, though. No one knew what they were thinking about.

In Knife Grave, Han Sen and Black Steel were scaling a mountain. They were looking for higher-tier weaponry. Black Steel looked happy, as he took off running towards a knife he had spotted.
