Chapter 2202 The Power of a Drum

“My daughter cannot control the strength she uses on the Drum. Will that be okay?” Han Sen double-checked with them.

The worker laughed, pointed to the base around them, and said, “The base has the appropriate equipment to absorb and sustain the sonic power. Even if a King whacked a Jade Drum, the excessive force would be dampened by the technology. Only a small bit of the shockwave will ultimately spread. Do not worry. And if there are any issues here at the registration booth, we will claim full responsibility.”

“That’s good.” Han Sen nodded. He had been afraid something terrible might happen, and he would end up being responsible for it.

He had heard the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum’s noise before, and he knew it was quite different from the average Jade Drum. An ordinary Jade Drum expelled its sonic powers in a wide radius without much of a focus.

The Blood Scorpion Jade Drum’s behavior was unique. The force lashed out in the manner of a scorpion’s stinging tail. When the Drum was struck, the sound was sharp and focused. It pierced right through a person. It was very difficult to describe.

Bao’er had struck it lackadaisically earlier, and that small blow was enough to bring Han Sen and Huangfu Jing to the brink of death. If Bao’er hit it any harder, there was every chance someone in that establishment could die.

“Friends, my daughter doesn’t know how to measure the strength she exerts. How about you all take a step back, in case something happens. It’s so you can avoid injury.” Han Sen looked at the elites in the lobby. People of all different races were assembled there. If the Drum killed them all, it would mean Han Sen had caused a grievous offense to each of the races.

“It’s a Drum. Just hit it! Why must you keep talking?” All the people present were very skilled at sonic powers already, so they were all very eager to see the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum’s power. They weren’t willing to just leave on a whim.

“Um, if you guys don’t want to leave, then you may want to take some measure to protect yourselves. Don’t take it out on us if you end up getting hurt after a fair warning,” Han Sen said.

“Who will take it out on you for this? We might take something else out on you for talking constant crap and not getting a move on. Hit it now or put the Jade Drum down and get lost!” Many of the elites were growing annoyed with the delays.

“Well, I warned you. All I can say is, look after yourselves.” Han Sen set Bao’er down by the Drum and then retreated. He summoned his Bai Sema around himself, Huangfu Jing, the worker, and the registry booth. Then, he blinked to Bao’er who was still outside of the Bai Sema. “Bao’er, hit it. But don’t hit it too hard.”

Han Sen shielded the worker because he was genuinely afraid that the man wouldn’t be able to withstand the hit. The Drum couldn’t be registered if the person who was supposed to register it died.

Everyone saw Han Sen taking this so seriously, and they started to appear a little confused.

The worker said that there was equipment in place to ventilate excess sonic powers. They were designed to deal exclusively with the power of the Drums. Even if a King class elite struck a Drum, nothing much would happen. The Blood Scorpion Jade Drum was a mutant Jade Drum, yes, but if a mere child was going to strike it, that shouldn’t have posed much of an issue.

That was what the onlookers were thinking, anyway, as they saw Bao’er standing over the Jade Drum. Then, she hit it.

Pang!

The small hand came down on the drum, and a very low boom sounded. Before anyone could react, they all felt as if steel rods had been driven down into their heads.

Bzzt!

Everyone’s head buzzed, and their bodies felt like they were being impaled. No one present could keep their bodies composed, and they collapsed to writhe and convulse on the ground. It was like they were having a stroke.

They began to froth at the mouth, and many of their bladders let loose. The entire lobby began to stink, as a whole bunch of Nobles began rolling around on the ground and soiling themselves.

Sonic Butterfly King and Stephen believed themselves to be sonic elites. And there was sonic absorption equipment installed there. They hadn’t taken any measures to protect themselves.

They had no idea that the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum would pose that big of a threat when compared to the average Jade Drum. When the strange Drum sounded, they didn’t even see the sonic ripples assault them. The sonic needles didn’t give them time to block. Their brains no longer functioned correctly, and they collapsed to wriggle and roll across the floor. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Although they weren’t in as bad shape as the Dukes and Marquises, they still felt as if their heads were about to explode. They couldn’t think straight, and they couldn’t even lift themselves up off the floor.

Han Sen thought he’d end up killing someone, but it looked as if no one had actually died. Their heads had been hit fiercely, though, so he did not think anyone would be recovering for quite some time.

It looked like the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum’s power didn’t actually kill those it affected. It just messed with their brains and left them incredibly dazed.

Han Sen kept thinking that such a weapon was perfect for him.

And while all those people were still disoriented, Han Sen could take Huangfu Jing and Bao’er to leave safely.

“You guys said the Thousand Treasures would bear the responsibility for anything bad that might happen. Can we register this item now?” Han Sen shook the worker to rouse him and get his attention. The man was still frozen in disbelief.

The worker looked very surprised by the events that had just transpired. He watched the Nobles rolling around on the floor. While they might have looked very elegant only moments before, they now looked filthy with all the bodily deposits they were rolling in. Their prior cockiness had quickly evaporated.

Even Sonic Butterfly King and Stephen. They were mumbling something about being dizzy and needing to sit on the floor, but they couldn’t help but touch the waste unleashed by the other Nobles.

“What are you waiting for? Hurry up and get this thing registered.” Han Sen stared down at the worker.

The worker snapped out of his daze as if he had just woken from a dream. Then, he went to register the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum.

After that, Han Sen took his companions and departed. The Blood Scorpion Jade Drum was strong, but that was because Sonic Butterfly King and the others hadn’t bothered to prepare any defenses. Now that they knew what to expect, it would be harder to use the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum on them again.

Clients weren’t permitted to kill anyone on Planet Jade Drum. Being wanted by the Thousand Treasures would be bad. Han Sen needed to put as much distance as he could between himself and the people who had just been dazed while they were still unable to follow.

Han Sen took Bao’er away from Planet Jade Drum and thought to himself, “The Blood Scorpion Jade Drum’s dazing powers are strong. Even the Kings were affected by it. I really need to get its approval so I can use it for myself in the universe. If I use that on an enemy, I can do whatever I want to them.”

Ten minutes after leaving Planet Jade Drum, Sonic Butterfly King and Stephen started to regain their senses. Their heads, however, were in agony.

Sonic Butterfly King ignored his own discomfort. He stood up, with his hand clutching his head. He asked the worker, “Which way did they go?”

“They have now left Planet Jade Drum. Where exactly they went, I do not know,” the worker said.

Sonic Butterfly King wouldn’t dare attack the people of the Thousand Treasures. While holding their heads, they left Planet Jade Drum in the hope of finding their escapees.

After ten minutes of searching, they were unable to find Han Sen, and they had no clue in which direction he might have fled.

Sonic Butterfly King flew out of Planet Jade Drum, his body still shivering. He had a pounding headache that was worse than a heavy hangover.

Stephen followed. He was in the same state, and he didn’t find any trace of Han Sen’s group either.

They were lucky that their King class bodies could withstand what they had just endured. The Dukes and Marquises were sure to be out of commission for another few days. Their heads felt as if they were going to explode.
