2010 Under the Sky Knifeskill

Han Sen’s words startled Yun Suyi so much that she leaked some of the Jade Air.

“Does he want to date me? Should I go or not? He has a wife, and he is the father of two children. Maybe he has just identified the flaw with Under the Sky... Yun Suyi, what are you thinking? How could he possibly discover that?” Yun Suyi’s head was a mess, and her thoughts kept going in circles.

After the second Jade Air ended, she left White Jade Building swiftly to escape. But when she returned home, her mind continued to chum over what Han Sen had told her.

“No, I can’t do this! I have to face it. I need to tell him, and then end this. I need to be Yun Suyi once more.” She rolled around in bed for a long time, but she couldn’t sleep. She eventually got up and got changed, then rode her Jade Wing Tiger to Jade Island.

Yun Suyi was an emotional wreck. She wanted to end her association with Han Sen. But when she thought about doing it, she felt sick to her stomach.

Yun Suyi rode to Little Jade Island, and there, she saw Han Sen practicing a knifeskill. It was Under the Sky.

Yun Suyi’s tiger landed on the island, prompting Han Sen to lower his knife. He smiled and said, “I’ve been practicing Under the Sky for a while, and I can confirm that the problem you were having isn’t an issue with your execution of the skill. The problem lies within the knifeskill itself. After concluding my research, I was able to fix this issue. You can try it and see how it works.”

As Yun Suyi flew to the island, she kept reminding herself to be honest with Han Sen. But when she was on the island, she couldn’t bring herself to say anything she wished to.

After hearing Han Sen’s claim that he had found a way to fix Under the Sky, however, she looked at him with disbelief. ‘You really found a solution?”

“I’ve altered how the skill is used. It’s less like I fixed it and more like I used a replacement part. I haven’t worked out all of the details yet, but it’s not dangerous if you’d like to give it a shot,” Han Sen said.

“What did you think of to fix Under the Sky’s problem?” Yun Suyi did not believe Han Sen had fixed it, but she was still curious.

All the geniuses of Sky Palace had been unable to fix the issue, and Han Sen had only been practicing Under the Sky for about a month. For him to have fixed it in such a short time was quite unbelievable.

“Watch me perform it once.” After that, Han Sen walked into the field, drew Ghost Teeth Knife, and performed the modified Under the Sky.

When it started, Yun Suyi was a little confused. But before long, she looked quite shocked.

Previously, she had planned to use the knifeskill to get close to Han Sen, and so she approached the skill quite seriously. Also, Under the Sky was originally created by the Yun family, so the family’s scroll was different from the one in the Holy House.

The knifeskill was the same, but there were many comments and annotations in the Yun family’s Under the Sky. Those tips and explanations were priceless, and Han Sen hadn’t benefitted from being able to read them.

So, despite the fact that Yun Suyi hadn’t practiced too much, the notes allowed her to understand a lot.

As Yun Suyi watched Han Sen’s Under the Sky, her jaw dropped.

“The problem with Under the Sky is fixed. How was... how did he do it?” Yun Suyi looked completely stunned.

“Did he practice with the Textless Book? But that should be impossible. And what outsider can learn Truth spell? The Textless Book is a secret of the Sky, and only the Sky can practice with it.” Yun Suyi looked at Han Sen with a complex expression. Even long after Han Sen finished performing the knifeskill, she was trapped in deep thought.

“What do you think? Do you think that fixed it?” Han Sen asked Yun Suyi, putting the knife away. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Yun Suyi’s mind eventually returned to the present. She looked at Han Sen, and a while later, she said, “Han Sen, can you tell me how you did it?”

Han Sen had already devised an explanation that was a mixture of truths and falsehoods. “When I traversed the Sky Road, the words of Sky Palace came into my body. They came from the Textless Book, and Under the Sky came from the Textless Book, too. So, they share something in common. I cobbled this together during my research, but I wasn’t sure if it worked. What do you think?”

Yun Suyi’s eyes avoided him, but she quietly said, “I am not sure. Could you please teach me, so I can understand better what it is you are thinking?”

“Of course.” Han Sen nodded, and he went on to say, “But my method is a bit tricky. You need to understand the feelings of Sky Palace in order to use this fix.”

Yun Suyi looked disappointed, and she shook her head. “I grew up in Sky Palace, and I have read those words many times. With that being said, I have never picked up the feelings that you’re talking about. Maybe it is because I am too used to it, but I’ve never noticed anything while reading those words.”

“Don’t worry; I have another solution. I can allow you to experience the feelings of Under the Sky.” Han Sen smiled. “How?” Yun Suyi asked in surprise.

“I can use Under the Sky to fight with you. That way, you can feel my knifeskill. After a while, you should be able to learn it naturally,” Han Sen said.

“Does it work that way?” Yun Suyi’s eyes shone brightly.

“Try it, and we’ll find out.” Han Sen brought out two practice jade knives. He handed one to Yun Suyi and picked up one for himself.

He was just helping Yun Suyi practice, so there was no need to use Ghost Teeth Knife for such an exercise.

Yun Suyi practiced with Han Sen and tried to feel Han Sen’s knifeskill. She didn’t know if she was making a mistake, but she felt as if her body was tangled up by an invisible knife air. She couldn’t seem to escape it.

“I think too much. He really did fix the problem with Under the Sky. But it only took him a month, so how... And he practiced Under the Sky so well...” Yun Suyi kept turning it over in her head, but she couldn’t figure it out.

Over the next few days, Yun Suyi kept coming to practice with Han Sen. For some reason, Yun Suyi did not file any sort of report to say Han Sen had fixed Under the Sky. She was just hoping she could practice with Han Sen like this, each and every day.

With Han Sen’s help, Yun Suyi quickly became a beginner of the modified Under the Sky.
