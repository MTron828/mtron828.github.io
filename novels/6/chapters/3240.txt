Chapter 3241 Go Back

It was very quiet inside the old temple. There was still a scary light being released, along with subtle chanting.

“Jing Zhen is hoping we can take back the dragon air,” Jing Zhen prayed again.

The chanting in the old temple came to an end. An old voice was heard. “My King, go back.”

Qin Jing Zhen’s face changed. He looked at the old temple and insisted, “Alpha, I am the leader of the Qin Kingdom, and I am asking you to take back the dragon air.”

The old voice sighed. “My King, you do not have long. The Qin Kingdom requires the aid of the An Yang Ting. You should just return.”

Qin Jing Zhen’s face looked as pale as snow. His body shivered. He looked angry. As if he had been wronged, his disposition became one of utter hatred.

“Father,” Qin Bai quickly moved to hold Qin Jing Zhen. He looked worried, so he shouted.

He did not seem to know what that meant, and he did not know what Qin Jing Zhen was doing. He could tell that whatever his plan was supposed to be, it had failed.

Qin Jing Zhen waved his hand and signaled for Qin Bai not to speak. He looked to the old temple and slowly said, “I just wanted to ask if I was still the king of the Qin Kingdom or

not.”

“Yes, but you are dying,” the old voice said. “There are things you should let go of. Otherwise, you will find yourself hurt. Go back now and I will pretend you did not set foot in here on this day.”

Qin Jing Zhen did not speak. He stared at the holy light of the old temple. His face looked very conflicted. It could not be described.

Qin Jing Zhen gnashed his teeth and said to Qin Bai, “My Son, please take me away from here.”

Qin Bai was naive, but he was not so playful at this moment. He held Qin Jing Zhen and departed the old temple.

“Blergh!” After leaving the old temple, Qin Jing Zhen hadn’t gone too far before being unable to contain his emotions. That, in addition to the fact that he was very injured, resulted in him coughing up blood all across the dusty, stone street.

“Father!” Qin Bai was shocked.

“I am OK,” Qin Jing Zhen said as he raised his head. “Let’s just go. I am not dead yet. I am still the Qin Kingdom’s king.” He wiped away the blood and observed the monastery ahead.

Qin Jing Zhen and Qin Bai went back and kneeled three times. Qin Jing Zhen said, “I, Qin Kingdom’s king, Qin Jing Zhen, brought my son to greet the alpha. Please take back the dragon air.”

Inside the shining monastery, a voice of a holy and serious woman was heard. “Jing Zhen, why are you so stubborn? You are the Qin Kingdom’s king, and your son will become the Qin Kingdom’s king. Why must you care about anything else?”

“Jing Zhen is asking you to take back the dragon air.” Qin Jing Zhen gnashed his teeth and prayed.

“Go away.” From the monastery, only those two words were heard. Then, there was silence.

Qin Jing Zhen’s eyes looked as if they were on fire. He did not say a word. He merely stood up. He had Qin Bai hold him and take him around all sorts of old, shining buildings. Everywhere he prayed, he received a rejection.

Inside those old buildings, the strongest elites in the Qin Kingdom were gathered. The people in the Qin Kingdom with the most important blood were there. The Qin Kingdom selecting a king did not boil down to their potential. They did not depend on their powers. They only saw if they were capable of being a king. To protect these old buildings, they had to be the strongest of a generation.

No matter how strong the Qin family members were, if they made a promise to go to the old buildings, they would lose their identities and become old building guardians. They were the last line of defense for the Qin family.

Because they had no name or title, they were only a part of the Qin family. So, Qin Jing Zhen had no choice but to call them alphas.

In this last defense, one needed the leader of the An Yang Ting and the king to start it. That was how the Black Dragon Promise began. The An Yang Ting leader who had the black big evil dragon king would receive the black dragon buff. They would become the strongest in the Qin Kingdom. They would beat out everyone.

Now, Qin Yuan alone had started the Black Dragon Promise, and the Qin Kingdom’s people protecting the old buildings still went ahead to use the Black Dragon Promise. Even when Qin Jing Zhen, who was the actual king, came out to request a shutdown of the operation, it was rejected. They really wanted to keep Qin Yuan and kill Han Sen.

Qin Jing Zhen and Qin Bai prayed everywhere they went. Qin Jing Zhen’s face started to look pale. It was, without a doubt, because he was dying. The Qin family’s people had given up on him, who was the king.

“Qin Jing Zhen, stop being so ridiculous. You are a king, and you are a king that was chosen by us. You should face your death like a real man. Do not ruin the fate of the Qin Kingdom because of what you want.” In an old place, a serious voice was speaking. “Qin Jing Zhen is asking the alpha how I will destroy the fate of the Qin Kingdom.” Qin Jing Zhen looked pale, but he was calm. He looked at the old building as he spoke.

“Mirror Moon is a miraculous treasure,” a voice from the old place said. “It can bring people back to life. You are the Qin Kingdom’s king. For your own sake, you give it to other people. That alone proves how weak you are.”

Qin Jing Zhen laughed and said, “My Alpha, Mirror Moon has remained in Candle Garden for the longest time. Who has ever used it to revive anyone? Who has it ever benefitted?”

“It is merely because it is not yet the time,” the voice from the old building replied.

“If no one is ever benefitted by it, it is useless. I am using it to get a few extra years of my life to do more for the Qin Kingdom. What can be wrong with that?” Qin Jing Zhen clenched his fists.

“No matter what, Mirror Moon is so important that it cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of an outsider,” the voice from the old building said. The tone was cold and heartless.

“Does that mean my life is worth less than that gene race?” Qin Jing Zhen was sad. “You do not have much time. You should let go when you are supposed to.” The voice in the old building sighed. “Qin Jing Zhen, go back. Do what you can and leave the rest to Qin Bai.”

Qin Jing Zhen’s voice trembled. His eyes were deprived of hope. Nothing more could disappoint him now. “For as long as I am alive, I am still the king of the Qin Kingdom,” Qin Jing Zhen coldly said. He grabbed Qin Bai and returned to the palace.

Qin Bai wiped his tears away as he asked, “Father, is Han Sen going to die?”

Qin Jing Zhen was silent. He was ashamed. He was the king of the Qin Kingdom. He was the greatest king in the universe, yet he could not save the life of a single soul. This was also taking place in his kingdom and on his own turf. What kind of humiliation was this?

In the sky, Qin Yuan looked at Han Sen like a god. The black dragon gave him a power that let him destroy the universe. Han Sen was no threat to him now.

“Han Sen, what do you have to say for yourself?” Qin Yuan stepped forward with the whole world suppressing Han Sen. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Qin Yuan did not represent one person. He was representing everything and the entire history of the Qin Kingdom. He was the base of the Qin family now. Even if a sky full of God Spirits came down, it would not change the Qin Kingdom because the Qin Kingdom belonged to the Qin family.
