Chapter 3185: Extra Story for Commemorating Two Years – The End Is Not the End

My name is Han Jinzhi, a five-year-old child in Elephant Kindergarten, year three. I should be at the stage of a flower with a colorful life. To me, all I see is darkness.

I am from a family of liars. My father was a liar. My grandfather was a liar. My grandad’s grandad was a liar. I don’t know which grandad it started with, but we are a family of scammers.

The scammers are an organization. The people in this organization disguise themselves as fortune-tellers. All they do is lie to people. Although the organization’s members can tell fortunes, none of them believe in fate. The so-called fate is just a tool for scammers to lie with.

The scammers do not believe in fate and reincarnation. They do not believe in karma. They do not talk about relationships. They are good at watching people and calculating their decision.

If people become a target of the scammers, it means nothing but bad luck for them. They would end up losing money easily. If their luck was very bad, the family would probably be broken, and people would die.

I come from a family with that kind of background, but I believe in fate. More accurately, I can see fate.

Yes, to use words that modern people use, you might say that I have superpowers. My powers enable me to see things.

My powers enable me to see more than the fate of a person. Every substance in this world can be seen through by me, and I can analyze the fate of all.

For example, I can see the results of the next lottery. I will be able to tell what the lottery numbers are. If I wanted to, I could see which horse will win in the next horse race.

I can even tell what job people will end up doing, who they will end up marrying, and where they’ll die. If I choose to, I can see everyone’s ending.

Although my powers cannot enable me to see one’s progress, seeing the end, which is all I can do, is enough.

I am like a cheater who can see all the answers to an exam. It does not matter how I get somewhere. As long as I can see the answers, it does not matter. I cannot be wrong.

Some people think this is great. It is like living the life of a cheater. It certainly makes people jealous and crazy, but I would rather not have any power. The power to see the fates of all has led me down a dark life. Although I am only five years old, I carry the weight of an old man on his death bed. I am not interested in anything.

In kindergarten, I have a very good friend. He loves to play football. His dream is to become a football-playing superstar. He also wants me to practice playing football with him so I can become his best partner. He wants to win the World Cup and become a superstar.

I thought this was a great idea. After thinking about it, my superpower started. I saw my little friend’s future.

In the future, I can see he is not a football player. He is a fat, middle-aged salesman who gets drunk every day. Not even mentioning football, after running 150 feet, he would probably end up collapsing due to exhaustion.

It was at that moment I lost all interest in football. No matter how hard I try to play with him, I knew he would not end up being a football player. It would just be a waste of time. The fates I see are never wrong, and they can never be changed.

In Elephant Kindergarten, I have a very beautiful classmate. I like her a lot. I would like to be her best friend. I might even like to be more than that. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When I think about her, my superpowers kick in. It enables me to see into her future. She will be married to a 40-year-old bald guy. She will wear a wedding dress and go down the aisle of a church with that man.

At that moment, my life was ruined.

I lost interest in everything because no matter what I did, I saw the end of all futures.

I go to watch football, but I know the result. I go and watch a movie, but I know what the ending will entail. If I go to watch pretty women swim, but I see the pretty women become old before they die. This world is cruel to me. Darkness is all around me. It’s all there is.

I have tried to change fate, such as me hating onions. I saw that my mother was going to make onions and fried eggs in the morning, so I threw all the onions away at home and bought all the onions in the supermarkets and markets of three shopping districts.

Don’t ask me why a five-year-old kid can do this. Money has never been a concern for me.

The next morning, I saw that the eggs for breakfast still contained onions. It broke my little heart.

“Baby, you should eat more onions. Recently, Grandad from the countryside has grown a lot of onions. It was a great harvest this year. We have lots and lots of them.” Mom was happy as she was telling me this.

So, we ate onions for a month. I started to think it was a punishment from God for me trying to change fate.

No one can understand my pain. In this world, there are no unknowns to me. There is nothing fresh for me. I have lost the thing in my life I most cherished. What was that? It was a hope for the future.

On my way home from school, I watched the sunset above the river. It made me feel extremely sad.

I asked myself why a five-year-old kindergartener would end up walking home alone. It was no big deal because my mother, father, grandfather, grandmother, uncles, and aunties are all scammers. They are the masters of it. They have always been busy. They never had the time to pick me up from school.

Of course, my mother tried to take me to school. On our way there, she scammed two wallets and a car from someone. By the time we reached school, she tried to scam my kindergarten teacher. I forced her out of the school and begged them to never take me there again.

“Sigh. What is the point of my life?” Sitting near a river, my heart just felt sad.

Going home was meaningless to me. There would be no one at home. I heard that everyone will be taking part in an operation to scam a rich man. It has been half a month since I saw them.

“Little Brother, why are you here? Did you lose your family?” A soft voice sounded in my head.

From the tip of my nose, I detected a very young presence. I raised my head to take a look. I realized it was a big sister wearing white sports clothing. Her hair was up in a ponytail.

I was shocked. I had never seen such a beautiful woman there before. She was obviously out for a jog. She must have been living in the area.

The big sister noticed I did not respond. She crouched to my level, took my hand, and asked me, “Little Brother, what is your name?”

“My name is Han Jinzhi.” I could not help but answer. Usually, I did not talk to people, but I was a kindergartener who judged people by their appearance. This girl was mega pretty and cute. I was more than obliged to answer her.

“Your name is pretty funny,” the big sister said with a soft smile. “It does not sound like a name someone this young should have.”

“My name was given to me by my grandfather,” I replied. “He said our family cannot be made to obey ghosts and gods, nor do we need to have manners. We don’t need to be kind or care about ethics and moralities, but we must be respectful. Otherwise, we are not human. That is why they gave me the name Han Jinzhi. It was so I could have a bit of humanity.”

Actually, I never understood what my grandfather meant. When they started to lie, they never seemed to care about the well-being of others. When they got home, they never talked about lying.

“Your grandfather is funny,” the big sister said with a smile. Maybe she thought I was joking.

I did not dare look at her. I was afraid I might accidentally see her future and end up watching her die or have sex with an old man. That would only make me sad.

“Little Zhi Zhi, would you like to come and drink a milk tea with me?” the big sister asked.

Although I did not like milk tea, I was a kindergartener who judged people via their appearance. Therefore, I nodded in acceptance. I grabbed her hand and followed her to a milk tea shop.

I was not afraid of her being a human trafficker. When I was free, I helped two human traffickers who once tried to sell me. When I left, they thanked me.

The big sister was cute and nice. Drinking milk tea with her made me very happy. It made my sorrows fall out of mind for a time, which led me to eventually look at her. It was at this time my damned abilities of clairvoyance kicked in.

The scene that broke my heart played in my head. The beautiful and cute big sister got out of a red sports car. Then, a group of people dressed in black gunned her down. Her blood spilled out like flowers. Without a doubt, she was going to die.

My mood dropped into another realm of darkness. I only saw the future without knowing how or when it would happen. I also did not know where it would happen. Whatever the case might have been, I could not stop it from happening.

I hated myself for having powers like that, and I hated myself for being even more useless. I did not want things to end that way.

The big sister could see I was looking upset. With genuine worry, she asked me what was wrong. “Little Zhi Zhi, what is wrong?”

“Big Sister, can you not drive a red sports car for a while?” I tried again to change her fate.

“Why?” the big sister asked with a weird look.

“I can see the future. If you drive a red sports car, your life will be cut short.” I knew this would be very hard for her to believe, but I really wanted to convince her. I did not want to watch her die.

The big sister looked surprised. She used her soft hands to touch my head. She smiled and said, “Little Zhi Zhi, you are concerned for my well-being. I thank you very much for that, but I am not going to die.”

“I knew you would not believe me, but the future cannot be changed.” I was very disappointed. I felt an ache in my heart. I hated myself for being so useless.

The big sister grabbed my hand and looked serious. She said, “I believe you, Little Zhi Zhi. You just need to remember that the end is not the end. If you really have a superpower that enables you to see the future, if you see people down the line who require assistance, you should not give up the pursuit to course correct and help them. It does not matter what happens in the end. Just try your best to do your job. Is that OK?”

My mood was terrible. All I did was nod. I didn’t even listen to her properly. I left the big sister in a sour mood, but I kept thinking that I could not let this go.

She was a kind and cute big sister. I could not sit idly by and let her die.

“Even if God wants her dead, I must do what I can to save her.” My heart suddenly mustered the courage needed to fight.

Although I did not know her name or know where she lived, it was not a big problem for people who were born into a family of scammers.

Scammers were very good at gathering information and predicting things. I thought about the future scenes. The location where the big sister got killed was at a large crossroads. There were no signs. Judging from the plants near the road, there was only one place in the city it could have been. The telltale sign was the Allen Grass. When it happened, it had to be in this city.

“The width of the main road was 120 feet. There are only three main roads with a width like that.” I kept analyzing the images I had. I studied a map to try and find my target.

“Judging from the moon’s location, the time should be around 10 a.m. It is tonight...” I looked at the time. It was five minutes away from the time of the hit.

“No...” I hated myself for not trying to save the big sister sooner. If I had been able to do things sooner, I might have been able to keep her safe.

Before we parted ways, I should have gotten her phone number. That could have helped this situation be avoided.

I madly ran out of the room. I stole the bike my Mom rode to buy food each day and went as fast as I could to the location I had determined the event would be taking place.

The traffic rules and lights could all go to hell. I had to save Big Sister.

I road as fast as I was able to, but the bike felt as if it was no quicker than a snail. I watched time go by. I was in a huge rush.

Finally, I arrived at the street I saw in my future vision. I saw Big Sister’s red sports car. She got out of the car. She was very pretty that night. She was wearing a red jacket and stockings. Her heels looked very attractive.

At the same time, I saw men in black holding machineguns.

“Big... Sis... ter... hurry... run...” I was too late to save big sister. I road as fast as I could to the men in black and shouted.

Ta-ta-ta-ta! Pang!

The sound of the guns and a collision made their noises louder. I steered my bike to hit the men in black. The men in black fired their guns, but they did not hit the big sister.

“This is great!” I did not think about what the result might have been. I just felt happy about saving the big sister. I had never felt this happy before.

“Cut! Cut! Cut! Who is this kid?”

“I am sorry, Director. That is my friend.”

After falling onto the ground, I saw a middle-aged man with a megaphone. He was shouting madly. People were using all kinds of tools around. The big sister apologized to the middle-aged man. I had an emotion overwhelm me that had never happened before. I was frozen.

The big sister came in front of me. She held me in her arms and asked with worry, “Little Zhi Zhi, thank you for saving me. Are you OK?”

“I am fine. I am just glad you are OK.” I was finally starting to realize what had happened. I was not annoyed by my mistake. I actually thought it was rather wonderful.

After I told my five-year-old story, I lit up a cigarette and breathed deeply. I exhaled the smoke. With a righteous look, I said, “Ever since that time, I understood that the end was not the end. If I found people who needed help, I would help. I would ask for their phone numbers. Although the chances are one in a million, I have decided to save whoever I can. It was the promise I made to that big sister.”

The pretty girl sitting next to me looked at me. She looked scary. She was like a volcano about to erupt. She madly shouted, “Han Jinzhi, is that why when I went to the bathroom you decided to ask that pretty woman for her phone number?”

Slap!

What happened next was a slap. There was then the scene of a pretty woman madly leaving.

“Fine. I admit it. The story is real, but I only wanted to hit on the hot woman. I couldn’t help it because I am Han Jinzhi. I am a guy who judges people by their appearances.” Seeing the pretty woman leave, I picked up a cigarette and took another hefty puff. I let the smoke flow out. In my eyes, I looked into the future of the beautiful woman.

There was a fire where Han Sen was. Fire was everywhere in the bar. Wires sparked. Lots of lights fell from the roof. A big, circular light hit the beautiful girl’s head while she was running.

Ding!

The fire alarm started ringing.

“Can I change the future?” Seeing everyone running in fear with the fire spreading, I calmly sat in front of the bar. I picked up a drink and looked at the light in the center of the bar.

The scammers are an organization, the people of which are scammers that disguise themselves as fortune-tellers. All they do is lie to people. Although the organization’s members can tell fortunes, none of them believe in fate. The so-called fate is just a tool for scammers to lie with.

The scammers do not believe in fate and reincarnation. They do not believe in karma. They do not talk about relationships. They are good at watching people and calculating their decision.

If people become a target of the scammers, it was nothing but bad luck for them. They would end up losing money easily. If the luck was worse, the family would probably break and people would die.

I came from a family with that kind of background, but I believe in fate. More accurately, I can see fate.

Yes, to use words that modern people use, you might say I have superpowers. My powers enable me to see things.

My powers enable me to see more than the fate of a person. Every substance in this world can be seen through by me, and I can analyze the fate of all.

I can even tell what job people will end doing and who they will end up marrying, where they’ll die. If I want, I can see the ends of everyone.

Although my powers cannot enable me to see one’s progress, seeing the end – which is all I can do – is enough.

I am like a cheater that can see all the answers to an exam. It does not matter how I get somewhere, but as long as I can see the answers, it does not matter. I cannot be wrong.

I thought this was great, but after thinking about it, my superpower had only just started. I saw my little friend’s future.

But in the future, I can see he is not a football player. He is a fat, middle-aged salesman that gets drunk every day. Let’s not even mention football, but after running fifty meters, he would probably end up collapsing due to exhaustion.

It was at that moment I lost all interest in football. That was because, no matter how hard I try to play with him, he will not end up being a football player. It would just be a waste of time. The fates I see are never wrong and they can never be changed.

In our Elephant Kindergarten, there is a very beautiful classmate of mine. I like her a lot. I would like to be her best friend. I might even like to be more than that.

Of course, my mother has tried to send me to school. But on my way to school, she scammed two wallets and a car from someone. By the time we reached school, she tried to scam my kindergarten teacher. I forced her out of the kindergarten and begged them never to come to take me to school again.

“Sigh. What is the point of my life?” Sitting near a river, my heart just feels sad.
