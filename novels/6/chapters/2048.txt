You guys aren’t from Planet Sky Cloud?” the middle-aged shura asked Han Sen with rhetorical certainty.

“We aren’t. We’re here on business,” Han Sen answered. “You guys only serve shura, huh?”

“We serve humans, as well. It depends on the circumstances, but usually, no human dares to come in here.” The middle-aged shura laughed, and then went on to say, “The people who work here are retired soldiers. They were strong on the battlefields, and their presence is enough to scare away humans. Most who walk in through those doors end up p*ssing themselves. This is the first time I’ve ever seen a guest like her.”

You hate humans?” Han Sen asked.

“The shura don’t really hate humans, but this place isn’t a battlefield. Besides, with this little customer, you guys are free to eat here,” the shura replied carelessly.

“Boss, Golot is here again.” The female waitress shouted at the middle-aged shura man.

His face turned cold, and he quickly moved to the door. Before he reached the door, it was kicked open. A bunch of shuras, all wearing uniforms, came marching inside.

“Golot! What are you doing here?” the middle-aged shura said to a shura dressed like an officer of some sort.

“Collecting taxes. You should pay up now.” The officer looked like he was full of himself.

“I’m not paying you sh*t! This is Planet Sky Cloud. This isn’t a shura planet!” the middle-aged shura shouted at him.

The shura that were eating there all laughed. The people of Planet Sky Cloud did not care for military sorts.

“Really?” The officer laughed. He kicked the middle-aged shura in the stomach. The man was sent flying and came crashing down behind the bar. Bottles fell off the wall and rained down onto his head.

The people in the restaurant stood to flee, but the soldiers near the officer drew their guns. They aimed them at the people to suppress the scene.

“Stop! This is none of your business. Go back to work,” the middle-aged shura yelled at his employees. He stood up from behind the bar and then walked up to the officer. He coldly told him, “Golot, you may kill me if you have the balls to.”

“I won’t just kill you. You killed a member of my family, so I’m going to kill you slowly, as I will the rest of your employees.” Golot laughed, and the laugh made all the onlookers feel a chill.

“It has nothing to do with them. Come at me!” the middle-aged shura growled.

“They should die because they are with you! Wood, I will make you regret ever killing my brother. You should never have thought about touching royalty,” Golot hissed, while staring at him.

“Regret? I’d do it all over again if I could. I have no problem killing a traitor that betrayed his own men,” Wood said flatly.

Then you should die with him.” Golot looked murderous.

“Ha! Kid, who are you bluffing? We almost died out there on the battlefields already. We aren’t afraid. Come and kill us.” The waitress laughed humorlessly before taking a bottle and throwing it at them.

Pang!

Golot smacked the bottle away and fired at her.

Wood was fast, though. He hit Golot’s arm, making his shot go wide. Then, he punched the enemy’s nose.

“F*ck you!” The waitress ran forward, as did all her workmates.

They worked with synergy, dodging the guns as they got close enough to fight hand to hand.

The people on Planet Sky Cloud were all brave, and the patrons of the restaurant watched rather than fleeing.

The soldiers were unable to defeat the veterans, though. They were all beaten down quickly. Wood rode Golot to the ground, punching his face repeatedly. He was bleeding.

Some soldiers were knocked into the dining area every now and again, and whenever that occurred, customers would kick them away from their tables and back at the workers. It made them laugh.

“You shura are interesting,” Han Sen said, while looking at Jade Ming’er.

Jade Ming’er knew that fights often broke out between those of different ranks, but seeing such things firsthand made her angry. And furthermore, it was all being witnessed by a human. That made her feel sick.

Pang!

Someone stepped up next to Wood, who was still pummeling Golot. Before Wood knew what had happened, he was airborne again.

The scene went quiet as a gold-horned shura man stood over Golot.

“Uncle Seven! These people are guilty of treason. Kill them all!” Golot got up and pointed at Wood with one hand, while his other nursed his bloodied nose.

“Shut up!” the gold-homed shura snapped at Golot. He looked at Wood and coldly said, “Do you know the crime that is titled offending a royal?”

“I don’t f*cking care. We rent this place ourselves, here on Planet Sky Cloud. Who the f*ck cares about your bullsh*t royalty?” The waitress picked up Wood as she shouted at the gold-horned shura.

You are shura. That means you adhere to the laws of the shura no matter where you go. You have now broken these laws, and because of that you will die,” the gold-homed shura said calmly.

“F*ck your laws!” the waitress shouted.

“I am sorry, but you have to die.” The gold-horned shura moved, appearing right in front of the pair before Wood could look up.

He was so much stronger, and they were unable to react. They looked very angry, but very hopeless, too.

The gold-homed shura’s fist was just about to come down on Wood, but all of a sudden, it stopped. A fat hand appeared in front of the gold-homed shura’s fist. The fist stopped moving.

The gold-homed shura and Wood felt their eyes widen. The little girl had stopped the powerful punch with one hand.

“Hey boss, this is how I am covering the bill for our lunch.” Bao’er gave them an innocent smile. She grabbed the goldhorned shura’s fist, and as if he was a mere toy, she tossed him aside.

Pang! Pang! Pang! Pang!

The gold-homed shura’s body was raised in the air and slammed into the ground repeatedly, so fast that he turned into a blur. His body seemed to be warping under the force. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Wood and the others stared with slack jaws. Their eyes followed suit, as if they couldn’t believe what they were seeing.
