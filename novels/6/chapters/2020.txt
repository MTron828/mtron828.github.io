2021 Tough Will

Inside a storage shed in a kindergarten, Lu Zimei was in a strange position. She was sweating and her skin was red.

“I can do it...” Lu Zimei was lying on the floor, gasping.

She felt like her bones were going to fall apart. Her muscles were sore. If she moved, she’d feel like she was getting stung by needles.

After she signed that unfair contract, her sad life began. She had to do whatever Bao’er told her to do.

Bao’er told her that this was a strong geno art. Bao’er watched her practice, but she felt as if it was more like torture. It was a very painful process.

“It is okay if you do not wish to learn it, and the debt you have...” Bao’er was sitting atop a plank of wood. In her fat hand, she clasped many contractual papers.

Lu Zimei saw all those papers, and then she gritted her teeth and continued the horrible geno art that Bao’er was supposedly teaching her.

After all this time, she had incurred more and more debt. The debt she had now was something she could not pay back in multiple lifetimes.

Lu Zimei hated herself for not being able to resist the temptations presented by Bao’er. She had been drawn in by beautiful clothes and cosmetics, so she had signed a number of different contracts. That was unfair.

And of course, since she could not pay it all back, she thought that she might as well sign up for greater debts.

“Let’s stop here. We can continue this tomorrow.” Bao’er looked at the time and then jumped off of the wood plank. She walked out of the storage shed.

“D*mn kid.” Lu Zimei lay down on the ground like a rug, unable to move.

Han Sen was as sad as Lu Zimei. He kept fighting against different types of xenogeneics in the dream he was placed in. He couldn’t stop, for the xenogeneics kept coming. There was nowhere to hide, either. All he could do was kill.

Because he was inside a dream, he could only get tired mentally. His body was fine, so he could keep fighting without rest. Dream Beast did not want him to rest.

The worst thing, however, was that Sky Heart Lock worked in the dream. It made him depressed.

Han Sen did not know how long he had been fighting. He had pretty grown numb to it all now.

There were many xenogeneics in the dream, and they stretched out before Han Sen in endless lines. There were the likes of the Xuan Jade Spirits, but many others that Han Sen had never seen before, too.

All those xenogeneics wielded different powers, as well. They felt so real to Han Sen. Everything was so lucid that it was difficult to determine whether it was truly a dream or not. Han Sen had to use everything he could to fight, and he had come close to death on numerous occasions.

Dream Beast watched Han Sen with a strange expression. He told Han Sen that he would become a vegetable if he died in the dream, and that wasn’t a lie. He could make Han Sen die a mental death if he wanted to.

But Dream Beast did not plan on killing him. He did it so Han Sen would fight non-stop and give it his all. He wanted to see how long he’d last.

But Han Sen’s performance was beyond his wildest expectations. Han Sen only had to survive for a month, and he had already surpassed that requirement. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Han Sen had been in the dream, killing, for four months. He had yet to perish.

It was not strange that Han Sen could kill the xenogeneics because the creatures in the dream were set to Han Sen’s level. Even the higher tier ones had the same power as Han Sen.

He did this to train Han Sen, so Han Sen could learn more about xenogeneics. Through all of this, he would gain knowledge.

But amidst all that constant, intense fighting, Han Sen did not slip up once. His willpower was still perfectly focused. It was hard to imagine an Earl could have such a hardy will.

“This guy must have experienced something before. How can his will compare to Lone Bamboo’s? Is he the same as Lone Bamboo, in that he has a will that cannot break?” Dream Beast seemed befuddled.

Han Sen’s willpower was getting weaker, however. Despite that, he wasn’t going to get killed. Dream Beast knew how scary all of that must have been. He’d rather have his soul killed than give up. Not all beings had that kind of drive.

For Dream Beast, Han Sen’s will was shining like jewelry.

Dream Beast sighed. His eyes took on a dreamy look, and then he removed the dream from Han Sen.

He didn’t want to get Han Sen killed. If things kept going, Han Sen’s soul might have been exhausted. Then, he really would have died—and not just in the dream. Crash!

Han Sen’s body fell to the ground. His brain was buzzing, and it felt like it was ready to explode. That was the condition of one who was mentally exhausted.

Dream Beast called for someone to return Han Sen to his island. He took the next few days to rest, and he slowly got better.

When Han Sen recovered, his will was much clearer. His powers of sense were sharper. But the thing that made Han Sen the happiest was that he was now free.

He knew that Dream Beast was only training him, but he still vastly preferred the feeling of freedom.

While he was still sleeping, he let Bubble mimic him on the bed. Then, he slipped back to the Alliance. He held Ling’er and kissed her. Then, he held Ji Yanran. Han Sen thought it was the best thing ever.

No one bothered Han Sen, and he spent the next month relaxing. He almost forgot he still had the two Sky Heart Locks on him.

The happy days flew by, and two months after returning to Dream Island, Thousand Feather Crane came to visit him. He had news to deliver.

“The Ancient God xenogeneics space? What is that place?” Han Sen asked Thousand Feather Crane, stricken with confusion. He did not know why the leader of Sky Palace wanted to send him there.

Thousand Feather Crane looked worried, and he said, “Ancient God xenogeneic space is a xenogeneic space next to a Baron system. We don’t own it, but every time it opens, there is a spot available for us. I did not expect the leader to select you.”

“Is there a benefit to going?” Han Sen asked.

“Of course. While it is very big, it is also dangerous, I must note. Even the top Earls or Marquises might not make it out alive from such places,” Thousand Feather Crane said.

“What are these benefits?” Han Sen filtered out the dangerous part. He was afraid of danger, but if the leader wanted him to go there, there was no use worrying about it.

“The xenogeneics in Ancient God space are dangerous, but I do not know the specifics. I haven’t been there before, but my master said it isn’t just the xenogeneics you should be wary of. There are also those of the other races who will enter when you do.” Thousand Feather Crane explained what he knew.
