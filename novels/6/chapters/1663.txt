Chapter 1664 Ringtone

Han Sen looked glum. He had been keeping an eye on the entire shelter, and Bone Witch died under his watch. What’s more, he couldn’t even tell how. Although he had been drinking tea with Han Menger and Bao’er, Dongxuan Aura was on the whole time. It was surveying everything.

Han Sen saw Bone Witch clearly. She had been watching from atop the tower, and as she was on her patrol, she simply died. There had been no warning signs. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

And Han Sen did not witness any external power come to kill Bone Witch. It was like she had suddenly died of old age.

Gu Qingcheng arrived at the tower, and she didn’t look too happy, either. She had been watching the shelter as well. She had no idea how Bone Witch died, and that made her even angrier than Han Sen.

Queen and Lin Feng came running, but they did not speak when they saw the body. This had exceeded everyone’s expectations, and no one could tell how Bone Witch had died.

Ancient Sky Mirror was there, and if Bone Witch had been hurt by anything, she should have respawned at the mirror. But there she was, undeniably dead.

Everyone in the shelter was now very afraid.

They thought that with the mirror in their shelter, they had no reason to fear death. But now that the mirror had lost its effectiveness, their nerves started to creep up on them.

Now that they did not seem to have the mirror’s protection, many creatures were very scared when they thought about the elites that were coming for them. They thought that their days were numbered.

They buried Bone Witch’s body, and then Han Sen called for a gathering where every key figure of the shelter had to attend.

“Queen, you and Lin Feng should return to the Alliance. I will call you back when things are resolved,” Han Sen spoke to the humans.

Queen shook her head, and Wang Yuhang said angrily, “Little Han, who do you think we are?! Do you think we are the sort of people who leech off others and run off at the first sight of danger?”

Lin Feng patted Wang Yuhang on the shoulder, and added, “Calm down, Little Uncle. You know that is not what he was implying.”

After that, Lin Feng spoke directly to Han Sen. “This situation is grim. We don’t know how they managed to get Bone Witch, but there are certain predictions we can make.”

“What is there to predict?” Tang Zhenliu did not understand.

Lin Feng smiled and said, “The situation seems dire, but if you were an enemy that could kill others randomly and at will... Would you go for a simple guard? It means that there is a limit to the enemy’s power. This foe is unable to kill anyone they wish to.”

“Maybe he wants to play catch? Maybe he just wants to scare us to death?” Tang Zhenliu said.

“No. From Blacksteel Wolf to Bone Witch, the truth is, the creatures that have died aren’t very important. If I was the enemy, I’d go after someone like Cheap Sheep or Green Cow,” Jing Jiwu said.

“Why us? Why not kill you first?” Cheap Sheep and Green Cow fired back angrily at Jing Jiwu.

“That is because you are Han Sen’s right and left hands. You two are integral. If they wanted Han Sen to die of fright, they’d at least go for you two first,” Jing Jiwu said.

When Cheap Sheep and Green Cow heard this, they patted their chests. “Right! They don’t kill important people like us. That must mean the enemy’s power is limited.”

A few people around the table smiled. Even though Cheap Sheep and Green Cow were very important members of the shelter, they were probably the easiest to kill. That was what Jing Jiwu was saying. If they weren’t dead yet, it meant the enemy did have a limit and could not kill any they desired to.

“We need to find out how this enemy is killing our people. We also need to learn what this limit is.” Lin Feng thought for a minute, then said, “There are no leads for us to follow now, so we’ll have to wait and keep our eyes out for something.”

“What if someone else dies and we still can’t learn anything new?” Cheap Sheep felt quite worried.

“If many people die, we may not be able to see how they are killed, but more info can lead to better predictions,” Lin Feng said.

“What kind of method is that?!” Cheap Sheep exclaimed.

“Do you have any better ideas?” Jing Jiwu looked at Cheap Sheep.

The sheep stopped talking. Even Han Sen and Gu Qingcheng hadn’t been able to find out how Bone Witch had died.

Lin Feng and the others did not want to go to the Alliance. Han Sen spoke to them about changing the patrols slightly.

One night, when there was no killing, Han Sen brought Bao’er with him on patrol. When he saw Cheap Sheep and Green Cow, he almost jumped out of his skin.

Cheap Sheep and Green Cow were covered in yellow paper. The pieces of paper were charms with words scribbled upon them.

The charms were planted on their heads, bums, and every bodily crevice. Green Cow even had one that looked like a skirt. It was very obvious.

“Where did you get these from?” Han Sen asked with surprise.

“Boss, we asked Wang Yuhang to buy them for us. Apparently, it cost quite a bit. He said they had been blessed by a god. They can keep us safe and prevent evil from ever touching us.”

“We have lucky charms, too. If you wear them, your fortune increases. Even if we end up in a battle, I am sure we will be the last to fall. I bought this for you, Boss. You should wear it”

Cheap Sheep and Green Cow spoke with mystic tones in their voices. Cheap Sheep moved forward to present the charm to Han Sen.

Han Sen did not know what to say, though. Wang Yuhang had obviously scammed a lot of money out of Cheap Sheep and Green Cow.

“Thanks a lot.” Han Sen took the bag that they offered.

“You are our boss. We don’t want anything bad happening to you,” Cheap Sheep said.

“We will live until the very end,” Green Cow said.

“We will all live,” Han Sen said, and placed the charm in a bag.

Then, Cheap Sheep said, “Boss, you need to hang it on your chest. Let me do it for you. And I also got this charm for Bao’er.” As Cheap Sheep spoke, Han Sen looked increasingly glum. He looked beyond the walls of the shelter and heard a bell ring.
