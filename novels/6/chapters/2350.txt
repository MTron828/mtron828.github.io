Chapter 2351 Breaking the Door

While Han Sen was staring at the geno hall, the black crystal armor inside his Sea of Soul suddenly released a mysterious substance. It wrapped around Han Sen, covering him completely. After that, Han Sen couldn’t even detect his own presence. It was as if he didn’t exist.

Han Sen quickly thought back to the time with Kong Fei. “When the geno hall appeared previously, the black crystal armor did something similar to this. Is the black crystal armor connected to the geno hall? Or is it simply afraid of the geno hall?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

While Han Sen pondered this, he heard Ancient Water God roaring to the sky. “I have the name Water God! I am the alpha of water! I am going to become the Water God Spirit, and no one can stop me!”

When Ancient Water God roared to the sky, the water that had been suppressed by the geno hall began flowing toward him again. It was like a bunch of stars amassing in Ancient Water God’s body.

As the additional water strengthened him, Ancient Water God’s body grew powerful enough to tear the fabric of space into shreds. His enormous form rose, heading for the geno hall.

Han Sen stared up blankly. Ancient Water God’s power must have been practically endless to have reached such a high level. His body was unimaginably large, and it drowned the nearby planets as it moved. Seawater was the only thing visible in any direction.

Han Sen looked to the sky and saw that even the sky had been overtaken by water. And yet somehow, above that ocean, the mysterious geno hall was still visible.

“Ancient God is scary,” Han Sen thought with trepidation. He had seen many deified elites since coming to the geno universe, but this was the first time he had ever seen destructive power on such a massive scale.

If Ancient Water God wanted to kill, he could destroy an entire system within the space of a second. No living creature could block that sort of power.

Xius looked up with wide eyes, and she said, “Ancient Gods are born deified, and their lifespan is a billion years. Few creatures can ever hope to rival the Ancient God in this universe.”

Boom!

A loud noise boomed above them, forming massive waves on the surface of the hovering water. Then, a heavy rain was unleashed. A shockwave rolled out from the water, shaking the mountains as it brushed their peaks.

Han Sen and Xius were blasted away by the scary shockwave that had been released. It was as if they were struggling against the rush of a tsunami, but their efforts were futile. They were tossed aside like ants.

Pang!

Han Sen’s body hit a mountainside, and the peak collapsed. Blood trickled from Han Sen’s mouth. He used all his power to repel the force, but he couldn’t hold back the overwhelming shockwave. He couldn’t even stand up straight.

Boom!

Another shockwave rolled across the sky, and lots of heavy rain followed in its wake. The rain slammed down like a tsunami, shoving Han Sen back even further.

As the blows slammed into Han Sen and damaged his organs, they triggered the Kingese. Shining gold symbols appeared across Han Sen’s flesh, making him far stronger. Han Sen regained his feet against the force pressing down on him.

Xius hit the bottom of the sea and was pressed into the mud with the dying ocean creatures. She was about to be buried inside a crevice that appeared in the bedrock.

Han Sen frowned. He broke through the tsunami-like shockwave and raced next to Xius to pull her out of the crevice and the sea.

He grabbed Xius and looked up into the sky. The turmoil and heavy rain that followed obscured his vision, casting the entire planet into chaos. He couldn’t see anything.

Ancient Water God was still roaring above him, and he heard the sounds of big waves hitting space. The impacts seemed strong enough to make the stars themselves rattle and shake. Countless mountains were crumbling under the onslaught.

This level of power was far beyond what Han Sen could comprehend. With the protection of the Kingese, Han Sen barely managed to stay upright in the storm. He stood atop a big rock, looking up at the sky. He wanted to know what Ancient Water God was doing, but he couldn’t see past the wall of rain.

Xius was close to becoming a King, but she could only hide in the shelter provided by Han Sen’s stalwart body. She held onto him tightly to avoid getting pulled into the bottom of the sea again.

The whole universe appeared to be shaking under that tumultuous sea. Ancient Water God’s voice resounded throughout the universe with deafening volume.

Han Sen couldn’t see the actual battle, but he could hear in Ancient Water God’s roar that the creature was fighting. It sounded like the Ancient God was putting everything he had into the fight.

Pang!

Suddenly, Han Sen heard a strange sound, like a stone door grinding open. A light shone through the air.

That light beamed through the water above, cutting clean through all of the chaos. Han Sen had been nearly blind earlier, but now he could clearly see through the storm.

That light didn’t seem to be at full strength, though. It was as if someone had pushed open a door to let the light of a flickering candlestick seep out.

“The geno hall’s door has opened.” The water kept smacking Han Sen in the face, but he was still able to see what was happening clearly. That light was coming from the geno hall’s door, which had been pushed open a little.

“I am a god spirit, and no one can stop me!” Ancient Water God kept roaring. His enormous body was trying to force its way into the gap of the geno hall’s door.

“Did he succeed?” With the Purple-Eye Butterfly running in his right eye, Han Sen was staring at the geno hall’s door.

He didn’t know exactly how someone became a god spirit, but judging from what Ancient Water God was doing, Han Sen could guess that the Ancient God was making his way into the geno hall. Perhaps if he entered the hall, he would become a god spirit.

A thousand races had lanterns there, but they were just lanterns. Entering the geno hall as an individual was a different matter. Only a race’s geno lantern could reside in the hall.

Now, Ancient Water God was trying to force his body into the geno hall. He wanted to go in, but it wasn’t clear what would happen if he succeeded.

The enormous body pressed against the door, waves continually slamming into its surface. The water was going to rush into the hall at any second.

But suddenly, Han Sen saw a hand emerge from the gap of the ajar geno hall door.

That hand was so beautiful. The moment the hand emerged from beyond that gap, it pressed against Ancient Water God’s body and drove him back.

Then the hand vanished behind the door again. The geno hall’s door shut. The sea hung above them, perfectly still, and the storm stopped.

The door was closed, and the light was gone. Han Sen was now unable to see the geno hall. All he could see was that blue sea that had taken over the sky.

The next second, a red dye began to spread through the water. It opened like a flower. In moments, the water in the sky had become a sea of blood.

With a boom, the bloody sea collapsed. A rain of blood poured down, covering everything in crimson.
