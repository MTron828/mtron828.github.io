2051 Blowing Up a Planet with One Hand

“You are Han Sen?” the shura queen asked when she saw Han Sen without armor. She recognized him.

She remembered Han Sen because he was important in the Alliance. Plus, Han Sen had a blood relation to the Luo family. He was a distant relative of the Jade Shura.

Han Sen laughed, but he did not speak. Jade Ming’er stepped aside. She really hated them both. Han Sen and Bao’er had treated her like a maid, and she had to do everything they had told her to do, even if she didn’t want to.

The shura queen nodded at Jade Ming’er, then ignored her. She turned back to Han Sen. “You are not the master of the Bone Dagger. It should belong to the shura.”

Shura queen remembered that it was a shura woman who had used the Bone Dagger in the shura palace. No one could stop her. She used Falsified-Sky powers in their full form.

The strangest thing was when that woman gave the shura queen the Falsified-Sky Sutra. It allowed the Jade Shura to finish her skill, and in doing so, she became much stronger.

Jade Shura had originally thought it was God that had given them the rest of the skill, but now, she did not think so. “Does it matter if I am or not? You just need to know that I can destroy the shura,” Han Sen said.

“Why should I believe you?” the shura queen asked quietly.

“You came here, didn’t you? That means you already believe me.” Han Sen smiled, and he then went on to say, “The Battle of Franco, the Assault on Heilman’s, the Strike on 4690; they can flip the situation of the shura on its head. Can you actually sort out these problems?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s you!” The shura queen couldn’t believe it, and she stared at Han Sen. The things Han Sen had spoken about were incidents that could lead to the potential collapse of shura society. They hadn’t happened, but if the Alliance took action in the right way, the shura would lose.

They had survived so far because of the help they had received.

“Why are you doing this? You are just a human.” The shura queen could not believe all of this was coming from Han Sen. It did not make sense.

Han Sen laughed and looked at the shura queen and said, “In your eyes, this universe is everything. But to me, the shura and the humans are just toys. I like the Alliance more, but I don’t want to see the shura get destroyed, either.”

The shura queen looked at Han Sen. She could not accept this explanation.

“How about this? The shura are still useful to me, and we need you to keep going,” Han Sen said.

“What do you want me to do? I won’t sell the shura out,” the shura queen said with certainty.

“I need you to send some shura out to do work for me, but that will come after. Right now, I need you to take me to the shura king gravesite.” Han Sen planned to use the shura as spies in the future, allowing them to go to the Demon so he could learn more about them.

This job was perfect for the shura. If Han Sen had the whole shura empire under his thumb, he wouldn’t be afraid of the shura doing anything to the Demon.

“Impossible. Even if you kill me,” the shura queen said immediately.

Han Sen did not say anything. He turned on a video and showed the feed coming from a shura base. It was Planet Cardola.

“This is a beautiful planet.” Han Sen looked at Planet Cardola. From space, the planet appeared orange and green. It was exceptionally beautiful.

The shura queen did not speak. An important military planet like that should not have been spied on so closely. She thought Han Sen was threatening her, showing her that he could do anything.

The shura queen believed Han Sen was too naive, and the threat did not work on her.

“I suggest you take one last look at it. You might not see it again,” Han Sen said to the shura queen.

“If you want to threaten me, you are wrong to think you can,” the shura queen said impassively. She didn’t think it would be a big deal if Han Sen sent someone to that planet. It was too well defended.

Han Sen smiled and did not speak. He lifted a hand and clenched it into a fist. The shura queen and Jade Ming’er did not know what he meant to do by that.

In the video, Planet Cordola was suddenly crushed by something. It just imploded, then billowed out as a cloud of dust. The shura queen and Jade Ming’er were utterly speechless.

Jade Ming’er looked at Han Sen and said, “Do you think this broken trick can fool us?”

The shura queen thought the same same. There was no way that Han Sen could destroy a planet by simply moving his hand. There was no power like that in the universe; he’d have to be a god.

Han Sen did not explain. He told the shura queen, “You can use the phone.”

The shura queen started to look concerned. She picked up the phone and dialed a number.

Not long after, the phone fell to the ground. She started to shake in her boots, and she looked at Han Sen without being able to muster a single word.

Jade Ming’er was smart. There was only one possible reason for her mother to behave like this, but even so, that possibility was difficult to believe.

“It cannot be you who did it. This must be some trick!” The shura queen was no longer calm and composed.

She wracked her brain, trying to think of some power that could have destroyed Planet Cordola. Planet Cordola’s weapon arsenal could fend off an entire army, though. It was impossible for anyone to blow it up in such a manner.

Aside from God, the shura queen could not fathom any other possibilities.

“If you need me to, I can destroy more shura planets. Perhaps after seeing a few more go, you will believe me,” Han Sen said quietly.

When the shura queen and Jade Ming’er heard that, it felt like their hears were going to stop.

“Why must you go to the shura king grave?” the shura queen asked. She had no choice but to believe him.

“I am trying to confirm something. Don’t worry, I am not interested in your shura kings. I won’t disrespect their bodies,” Han Sen said.

“Let Jade Ming’er go, and I will go with you,” the shura queen said, gritting her teeth. She had tried hard to hide her vulnerability, but now, what was the point?

“It doesn’t matter where she is in this universe. I have some work for her to do, anyway.” Han Sen had no plans of letting her go.
