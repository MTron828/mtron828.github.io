Everyone focused on Sad Night. He walked around the blue metal cube, pretending that he was observing it.

After walking around it once, Sad Night said confidently, “If I am not mistaken, the handprints on the blue metal cube are a palm geno art.”

“Sad Night, I think everyone knows that. We can all tell this is the work of a palm geno art. You don’t have to say that!” The son of a King laughed.

Sad Night looked at that young Rebate and said, “Condensation, what I meant was... These prints don’t appear across the cube at random. All these prints together make a complete geno art. You could tell that too, could you?”

“How am I supposed to know you’re telling the truth? How do I know you’re not lying?” Condensation looked at him with disdain.

Sad Night smiled and said, “These palmprints might look like a random mess, but that is because all of them are overlapping. According to the feelings I am picking up, I only need to find the beginning of the palm marks to line them up and... Who knows, maybe I can rebuild the skill?”

Han Sen was surprised. He had picked up on this too, but not with the certainty Sad Night was displaying.

“Did this guy suddenly become a genius?” Han Sen wondered.

Han Sen was familiar with Sad Night, and he didn’t believe that the young Rebate had the intelligence or talent to come to this conclusion.

But the blue metal cube had only been revealed a short time ago, and Sad Night had not seen it before. It would have been difficult for him to gain knowledge of it from another source.

“Congratulations, Brother Night. The Night family has a smart heir,” Black Moon King said politely to Night River King in a palace. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Night River King frowned. He knew his son well, and he was surprised by this sudden impressive performance. Night River King should have been happy that Sad Night was doing well, but he was suspicious about his knowledge, more than anything.

You can say whatever you want to. If you’re as talented as you present yourself, find the starting palm and line them up. Recreate the skill for us.” Condensation still didn’t believe him.

Sad Night was waiting for someone to ask him this, and so he smiled and said, “I have an idea, but I don’t know if it is correct. If anyone sees the beginning of it, then I will let them demonstrate.”

After that, Sad Night looked at everyone. His eyes stopped at Han Sen, though, and so he coldly said, “Han Sen, you are so talented! I bet you understand, don’t you? Why don’t you show us where the beginning is?”

Han Sen shook his head. “I can’t see anything. Please teach us.”

“If no one else can explain, then I guess I will just have to embarrass myself.” Sad Night walked in front of the metal block and went to one side of it. After a while, he spoke again with confidence. “If I’m correct, this is where the palm skill begins.”

After that, Sad Night put his left hand into one of the prints. Then, he began striking the print with his own palms. He created some loud metal noises, but nothing broke.

Sad Night kept hitting that point and he said, “This palm is suitable for a wide performance of the skill. It elicits a galaxy-destroying feeling. This palm right here can destroy anything without mercy. It is very overbearing.”

Anyone could say that, of course. As Sad Night struck the palm print, he did so smoothly. He did not look experienced, but he did explain the feelings well. His thinking was correct.

“I underestimated Sad Night. He has performed well!” Rebecca said with shock.

Rebecca wasn’t the only one thinking this. The students in the garden’ the Dukes, and the Kings were surprised performance.

Even the Kings and Dukes had only been able to tell that it was a skill. They could not go into such a detailed description. Sad Night was rebuilding a glimmer of that palm skill, and it was a brilliant feat.

Seeing everyone look surprised, Sad Night became cockier. He continued to perform. He hit tens of thousands of palm marks, and he didn’t miss a single one. He flowed smoothly around the cube, and everyone admired his precision.

“This is the palm skill, from what I can see. Does anyone else have another opinion?” Sad Night was extremely full of himself by this point. He raised his head and looked down on Han Sen.

“Mister Night, you are good! That was beautiful,” someone complimented him.

“It was just luck, I suppose. It was nothing. I’m not like some genius who can only feel things sometimes and not others.” As Sad Night was talking, a katcha noise rang across the blue metal cube.

Everyone heard that noise, and they all turned to look at the cube. What they saw shocked even Sad Night.

He had watched the video Vikto had given him multiple times. The video had shown a person hitting the blue metal cube in a precise sequence. Sad Night had practiced repeatedly to become famous on this day.

But when the video finished the palming display, nothing was supposed to happen.

Katcha! Katcha!

Cracking noises continued to come from the blue metal cube, and the sounds were getting louder. Seams appeared on the edges of the cube, and it was cracking open.

“Is that palm skill a password that opens the blue metal cube?” Han Sen wondered.

Han Sen wasn’t the only one thinking this; all the Kings were wondering as well. They did not know what inside the metal object, so they moved to the plaza, just in case.

Before Night River King could issue a command, the blue metal cube opened wide. A smaller blue metal cube was inside it. It was decorated with a variety of strange patterns.

Then the second blue metal cube began to disintegrate, and Han Sen realized that the pattern wasn’t actually a pattern. It was many metallic limbs of creatures, all knotted together.

A swarm of metal monsters suddenly flew out of the cube. They were about half the size of a human, but they were all composed of blue metal. They stood on four legs, and they had claws on their hands and feet. Their heads were buglike, and their wings were metal, shaped like a dragonfly’s.
