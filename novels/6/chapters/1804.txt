Chapter 1805: Heartbea Super Gene

The little monster grunted at Han Sen and Yisha, wanting them to go inside quickly.

Yisha did not enter yet, though. Instead, she walked up to Han Sen and quietly told him, “I don’t know exactly what to expect once we enter that hole. How about we put our grudge aside and co-operate to get through this?”

Han Sen was shocked. He did not expect Yisha to make an offer of co-operation. He looked at her and said, “That’s what I was thinking about asking, too. But, if we are to co-operate, shouldn’t we be honest with each other?”

“What do you mean?” Yisha asked emotionlessly.

Han Sen pointed at the cocoon’s hole and said, “Don’t tell me you do not know what this is.”

The little monster grunted at Yisha again, sounding annoyed. The other monsters started to behave the same way. It looked as if they were willing to eat their captives if Han Sen and Yisha continued to delay. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“We shouldn’t talk out here. Let’s go inside first,” Yisha said. Then, she jumped towards some strands of silk conning out of the hole and climbed inside.

When Han Sen started to jump in after her, something pulled him from behind and stopped him.

Han Sen glanced over his shoulder and saw that the little monster was biting his gauntlet, holding him in place. Han Sen turned around, and then the monster put its head below Han Sen’s hand. It opened its mouth and dropped something.

And then, the little monster roared. The other monsters followed, telling him now he could go.

Han Sen was surprised. He looked at the item he had been given and noticed that it was some sort of orb. It was around the size of a ping-pong ball. It was soft and spongy, and also transparent. What it was, he could not quite tell.

Han Sen looked at the little monster one last time, accepted the ball, and then jumped up towards the hole in the silk.

Because there were strands of silk everywhere, climbing in was not that difficult. All it required was strength.

He raised his head and noticed it was a tunnel that went for about one hundred meters before opening up. Near the top, however, was a horizontal cave.

The three that had entered first were almost there.

Han Sen climbed up casually, and when he reached the entrance, Rocks Fall Duke and the others were not standing too far from there. They weren’t willing to walk in just yet.

Boom!

Just as Han Sen was going to enter, there was a loud noise. The whole cocoon shook. When Han Sen looked down, he saw that the exit had vanished. It seemed as if the cocoon had dropped back down onto its bed of sand.

“Now we are all in the same boat. So, we must take action together. There might be danger up ahead, after all.” Rocks Fall Duke looked at the others and spoke slowly.

Vic nodded and said, “He is right. We do face danger. We’ll only survive if we co-operate together.”

“Mister Vic is a smart guy,” Rocks Fall Duke complimented. He looked at Han Sen, Yisha, and the bird-faced man. He then asked, “What do you think?”

“I’m okay with it,” the bird-faced man said.

“I’m okay with it, too.” Surprisingly, Yisha actually deigned to answer someone.

But she quickly went on to say, “But if we co-operate, that also means we have to move together. Otherwise, co-operation is pointless.”

Rocks Fall Duke heard what she said, and before Yisha could continue speaking, he immediately said. “Yes! We need to move together. I am a Duke of the Rebate. I have experience leading millions. And since I have experience in this field, how about I lead?”

“Rocks Fall Duke, that is not right Anyone who has gotten this far is good, and they have experience. I don’t think I’m inferior to anyone here,” Vic said coldly.

“Mister Vic’s knowledge is indubitable. Everyone here is probably weH-known, so you all won’t be any worse than me.”

Rocks Fall Duke then paused, looked at Yisha, and said, “But we have two Rebate. It would be easier if I lead.”

Rocks Fall Duke wanted to take advantage of the fact there were more of his race in order to control the expedition. So, he had the right to speak.

Before Vic could say anything, though, Yisha said, “I think whoever commands us should be talented. They should have experience. They should be strong. And out of the five of us, I think he is most suited for the task. I would cast my vote on him.”

After that, Yisha pointed at Han Sen.

Han Sen frowned. Vic and Rocks Fall Duke hadn’t cared about him at all before this, but now that she had spoken, they looked at him with grave hostility.

“Yeah, someone from a small race no one has heard of before. Come on, how can you expect him to command those of a recognized higher race?” the bird-faced man looked at Han Sen with disdain.

He had fought Han Sen before, and Han Sen had effectively dodged each strike. He wasn’t happy about this suggestion by Yisha.

“I think he is suitable. If one of us is leading, someone will not be happy about it And if we can’t pick the strongest, it is only fair that we pick the weakest.” Vic spoke this, but he kept his real thoughts hidden behind a wicked smile.

“No! This is not a game. How can we select the weakest to lead? Do you want us all to die?” Rocks Fall Duke’s face changed, and he shook his head.

“If you think he isn’t capable, then I will have to lead.” Vic smiled.

Rocks Fall Duke’s face darkened, and he said, “I don’t think people will be happy about you leading.”

“Are you saying people will only be happy about you leading?” Vic laughed coldly.

“Stop fighting! Unless he leads, I won’t agree to follow anyone else. If you don’t want him to lead us all, then we can each go our separate ways,” Yisha said calmly.

Rocks Fall Duke and Vic frowned upon hearing this. Especially Rocks Fall Duke. He was extremely angry about the fact that his fellow Rebate wasn’t willing to support him. If the others weren’t there, he’d have tried to teach her a lesson.

Everyone went quiet then, and no one spoke.

Thump! Thump! Thump!

Suddenly, a strange noise came from deeper within the cavern. It was like a heartbeat, and it had a steady rhythm.
