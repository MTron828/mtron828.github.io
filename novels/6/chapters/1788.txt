1789 The Meeting of One Palm

The whole battleground was deadly silent. The hand that had grabbed the Pirate Bone Sword was depleted of its strength. Blood seeped out the back of the Viscount’s head, and he crumpled to the floor.

“Xenogeneic Viscount hunted; xenogeneic gene found. Xenogeneic beast soul obtained: Steel Centaur.”

Han Sen was so happy about this. He had obtained another beast soul, but he was still in the middle of a fight. He couldn’t take a time-out to examine it just yet.

“Where did this guy come from?” Mike and the other Barons were frozen. They couldn’t believe any of this.

A Baron was surrounded by the Angry Steel Army. He had not been killed, and he had managed to kill a xenogeneic Viscount. It beggared belief.

After the xenogeneic Viscount was killed, the morale of the Angry Steel Army began to wane. The assassination was serious stuff. Seeing it really dealt a blow to their resolve.

Angry Steel’s face turned red. He was bursting with a scary flame. He bowed to Mister Ji and said, “Mister Ji, I am going to kill that Baron myself.”

After that, Angry Steel Earl flew towards Han Sen.

Although it was embarrassing for an Earl to be forced to kill a Baron, now was not the time to be concerned with that If he couldn’t kill Han Sen now, it would be a tremendous loss for the Angry Steel Army. He’d lose most of his reputation, for sure.

“Everyone fall back,” Mister Ji said quietly.

Angry Steel froze. He turned around and asked him, “What did you say?”

“Are you stupid? Or are your ears clogged? He just told you all to leave,” the maid lifted her lips to say.

“But...” Angry Steel still wished to speak.

“This is your third time questioning the judgment of the master’s command. The Taurus are bold.” The maid looked at Angry Steel Earl coldly.

A cold sweat broke out on Angry Steel Earl’s forehead. He quickly bowed and said, “Please do not be mad. I am wrong. I will tell them to retreat immediately.”

After that, he commanded his entire army to fall back.

The centaur warriors were all shocked, but they didn’t want to fight anymore, anyway. They were all happy to listen to the command and swiftly abandon the battle.

“You get lost, too.” The maid looked at Angry Steel Earl with disdain. If he wasn’t useful, she would have killed him already for questioning Mister Ji three times.

Angry Steel did not say a word in response, and his face was expressionless. He didn’t look at Mister Ji, and simply returned to the camp with his army.

Han Sen was shocked to see the army suddenly fall back.

When the Kate that were boarding the ship saw the army retreat, they began to cheer.

Lao Zhuoma and the Barons, seeing what happened on the battlefield, looked nervous. They saw a shadow.

Mister Ji walked slowly onto the battlefield, along with the maid.

Han Sen, seeing Mister Ji and the maid, looked shocked. They looked like shura.

Mister Ji walked in front of Han Sen and bowed before him, saying, “I am of Demon. My name is Luo Ji. May I ask what yours is?”

When Lao Zhuoma and Mike saw Mister Ji, their faces grew pale. They did not know who Mister Ji was in particular, but they knew what the people of Demon looked like.

Demon was one of the higher races, unlike the Taurus.

“Demon?” Han Sen looked at Mister Ji, and then said, “I’m Human. The name’s Dollar.”

“Dollar? That’s a good name.” Luo Ji smiled, but he didn’t care if it was a real or fake name. He continued on by saying, “Dollar, you know that the Taurus are a subordinate race of ours?”

“Yeah,” Han Sen answered.

“It’s good that you know that. I’m not going to bully you, though. If you aren’t damaged by my palm, I will let you go. I promise you that no one will subsequently try to bring you harm,” Mister Ji coldly said.

“What if I don’t accept?” Han Sen asked.

Han Sen knew that if Mister Ji wanted him dead, the man wouldn’t have spoken to him as much as he already had. He was here for something, and he wasn’t planning on killing him.

“If you do not accept, you will have to help me deal with something. And after that, you will be free to go,” Mister Ji said. “That sounds fair, but you aren’t a Baron.” Han Sen lifted his lips. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Mister Ji laughed and said, “I am a Viscount, but when I use my palm, I will gauge it to a level that rivals yours. If you find out I use more power than I should, consider it my defeat”

“Okay, that’ll settle it,” Han Sen agreed.

Han Sen had just fought several Viscounts, but the Demon Luo Ji was not like the centaurs. He wasn’t at the same level.

Luo Ji did give Han Sen a sense of danger, though. Han Sen didn’t want to be reckless, walking into this. But with what was being offered, it didn’t make much sense to reject.

If their levels were going to be balanced, Han Sen didn’t think he’d have trouble dodging the palm.

Luo Ji smiled and raised his right hand. His fingers were really long, and his skin was really pale. It looked like the hand of a young executioner.

But when he lifted his hand fully, Han Sen’s face changed.

As his right hand was raised, it gathered up a weird power. It made no sound or sense, and normal people definitely wouldn’t be able to feel it.

But Han Sen was very familiar with this power. Many people had this power in his family, and he recognized it.

“The Falsified-Sky Sutra?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He looked at Luo Ji’s hand in shock. Without a shadow of a doubt, the man was using Falsified-Sky powers. Or the shura version of those powers. He knew he wasn’t wrong.

When Mister Ji heard Han Sen’s voice, he laughed and said, “This power hails from the annals of my race. It is Sky-Demon Sutra. If you can block it, I will never bother you again.”

Han Sen wasn’t familiar with the Sky-Demon Sutra, but he knew it must be the same thing as Falsified-Sky power. And Han Sen also knew why Luo Ji was so confident in his ability to hurt him. Falsified-Sky powers never missed, and no ordinary combatant could ever block them.

After Mister Ji said that, he put his hand in front of him. He swung it like an orchestrator with a baton. It looked rhythmic, and it didn’t even look as if there was much power in it.

Not many people could block Falsified-Sky powers. If that man used Viscount power against Han Sen, he didn’t think he could beat it But Mister Ji was using power that equated to Han Sen’s level. It was the hubris of arrogance.
