Chapter 3301: Science Test

“Not only for humans and humans?” Han Sen’s eyes twitched. He started to imagine many strange things.

It looked as if she was able to see into Han Sen’s mind and discern what he was thinking. Han Yufei explained, “It is not in the way you think. It is more like how the humans in the sanctuaries absorb the gene signals from other creatures so they can strengthen their genes. The idea of the rebirth machine is to modify genes so that the good genes can be inherited by the next generation. They can filter out the bad genes, such as sickness. Of course, no matter how much we modify our genes, we will need a good gene base. My people, the Witch, have very good genes. If we can mix the genes with the good genes of another creature, we can make a good life that is beyond what both races can achieve.”

“It does not sound too bad, but it does seem a bit weird,” Han Sen said with a frown.

Han Yufei seriously said, “You can imagine what it might be like if the rebirth machines worked. You can have another son and decide whether or not he has a double eyelid or a single eyelid. If you want him to have wings, he can have wings. You can make them taller, skinner, or even prettier. You can even modify the penis size. Do you not think kids like that are better? It must be better than trying your luck with a dice roll.”

Han Sen’s eyes twitched. “Maybe that is great, but I do prefer the surprise of a baby being born.”

“Your daughter and son are both excellent. Of course, it is natural for you to think of things that way. Have you considered what it must be like for people with genetic diseases? They have to endure a lifetime of pain and misery, and their sons, grandsons, and future generations all might have to suffer the same way. With this rebirth machine, this can be totally avoided. They can live happier lives, don’t you think?” Han Yufei looked very holy as she spoke.

Han Sen nodded. What Han Yufei said seemed to make sense, but he thought something was amiss. He just couldn’t tell exactly what that was.

“So, to erase all the pain and sicknesses for all humans, I need you to finish this rebirth machine with me. You are not going to reject my plight, are you?” Han Yufei squinted her eyes and looked at Han Sen.

“What can I do?” Han Sen asked with a frown. “I do not know anything about this.”

“You can let me handle the research side of things. I just need some of your genes to research. As you know, your genes are very good. The benefits of inheriting your traits are more than worthwhile. Littleflower and Ling’er had different genes from you at different points in time.” Han Yufei’s eyes glowed as she spoke.

“If all you require are my genes, then that is no problem.” Han Sen thought this might be a good thing. He did not need them, but other people might. It might have been good for them to increase the overall quality of the human race. If he only had to offer her some genes, Han Sen thought it was fine to do.

“Good. First, go inside there. I will collect your genes.” Han Yufei led Han Sen into a germ-free room. She pointed at a germ-free tube.

Han Sen laid down while Han Yufei brought out a metal needle. She walked closer to him and said, “Take your pants off.”

“Why would I take my pants off? If you want my genes, then just collect them from my hair.” Han Sen thought something was wrong. He looked at Han Yufei with suspicion.

“Did I not explain all of this to you already? The rebirth machine is for modifying genes. You need a baby to make it work, so I am collecting it now.” Han Yufei put the needle into the tube.

“Wait a minute. I only said I would provide you my genes. I did not say I would provide that. Plus, even with just that, you cannot make a baby with it.” Han Sen jumped out of the bed.

Han Yufei held Han Sen down and prevented him from jumping away. She seriously said, “Your understanding is very poor. Did I not say that the rebirth machine does not only work with humans and humans? Humans and the Witch can work too. Your genes are very good. Combining them with my Witch genes and modifying them will work to create a baby that is smarter than Ling’er.”

When Han Sen heard that, he had black lines developed across his head. He removed Han Yufei’s hands and jumped out of the bed. He looked upset. “I did not agree to do this to create babies.”

“Your style of thinking is too old-fashioned,” Han Yufei said. “Babies like this will be smarter than a natural baby. What is so wrong with that?”

“That is not the problem. We have no relation. How are we supposed to make babies?” Han Sen sounded depressed.

“Your thoughts are too traditional. Ancient, even! We are going to create a better life. It is like reproducing a great robot. We don’t need to involve ourselves with emotions. We will not have a relationship. This is just scientific research. You can just treat it like a good robot in research.” Han Yufei tried to convince Han Sen.

“You should go and find someone else for this,” Han Sen said with a wave of his hand. “I am too close-minded, so I cannot do this for you. Go and get Xie Qing King. He is very open-minded. He might be able to accept this.”

“His genes have not sufficiently evolved.” Han Yufei thought about it. She then took out a video player for Han Sen to use. I understand. Humans are annoying. Just use this.

“What is this?” Han Sen turned the video on and looked at it. His eyes opened wide. The video was a pornographic film that was very exciting. It made people’s blood boil.

“You are not used to just taking it straight, so I suppose this can help you. It is a similar way to collect it.” Han Yufei looked as if she understood it well.

Han Sen was feeling awkward. He hid the bulge in his pants as he said, “That is not what I meant.”

“You are so annoying! If you are not used to it, then I will help you.” After Han Yufei said that, she put on some rubber gloves and looked at Han Sen’s penis.

“I told you, this is not what I meant! Go and find someone else to help you with this test. I cannot help you.” Although Han Sen always felt shameless, this time, he fled. He ran out of the laboratory.

“Humans are annoying.” Han Yufei frowned. She put down the needle and took off her gloves.

Han Sen left the lab. He saw Han Yan waiting for him. Han Yan thought Han Sen was looking a little weird. She asked, “What did Han Yufei want you to do for the tests?”

“It was something chaotic. I did not know what she was talking about, so I told her to find someone else.” Han Sen did not go into too much detail.

“Sister Yufei is a very special genius,” Han Yan said. “I have learned a lot from her, but sometimes she can be a bit weird. You should get used to it.”

“I do not think I will ever get used to that.” Han Sen displayed a wry smile. He did not tell Han Yan anything more.
