Chapter 1882: The Kings Break Godlight

Han Sen kept swinging his Knife Blank, as if he was mowing down swathes of grass. He cut down endless numbers of Purgatory Beasts and the ghoulish arms.

“Little Han, what are you using? That is exceptionally good.” Wang Yuhang’s mouth hung wide open.

“It’s nothing. It might be useful right now, but it is difficult to tell how well it will fare if higher-level Purgatory Beasts rear their heads. Come on, let’s run.” Han Sen led everyone towards the hall.

Han Sen knew the Knife Blank did not possess special powers. After all, it was simply the child of a knife, and it wasn’t an actual knife. Its spirit was still weak, and it was still growing.

But that Knife Blank could very well be deified. That was because only items and weaponry of the same tier could defeat the Purgatory Beasts. That was how he was able to defeat the creatures and the arms.

Han Sen still had to decide how hard he wished to hit each creature he came against, though.

Black Hell Cow’s power was equivalent to that of a Viscount. Han Sen was able to kill their current enemies, but if they came up against something of an even higher level, it was likely he’d end up performing like Han Meng’er and Spell had. He’d only be able to stagger the fiends, and not do any proper damage.

Han Sen walked near Guna and Guya. They went at a meandering pace, so Han Sen went forward with Knife Blank. He killed everything he could see in his path. From arms to two-headed beasts to Black Hell Cows. Everything was slaughtered, and it allowed Guya and Guna to move at a faster pace.

It wasn’t long before they arrived at the hall they wished to go to. When they got there, though, the situation gave them quite the shock. The hall had fallen. The gold Gana Goddess statue was still glowing, though, bathing the area in a light that forbade the entry of beasts and phantom arms.

But inside the hall, Han Sen saw six shadows. They were the King class elites that had previously escaped. Gold Jade King was there, too.

“I thought they ran off. Why have they come back?” Han Sen looked at them with surprise.

Guya said coldly, “They thought that since Purgatory Heaven does not have a deified elite to control it, they could escape before it was activated. Clearly, they miscalculated.”

Han Sen could guess this. After they left, they had hoped to escape the entire planet. Unfortunately, they could not. So, they had tried to destroy Purgatory Heaven.

Han Sen had left the place before then, so he hadn’t seen them return.

The six Kings were carrying with them a strange array of powers. The use of those powers seemed to be twisting and distorting the very dimension. They were doing their best to get close to the statue.

Gold Jade King’s hand gripped a sword that looked very sovereign and prim. The sword was being thrust at the Goddess statue. Gold Jade King wielded it with finesse. It looked as if it could sever the atmosphere at any moment, but whenever it came within two meters of the statue, its approach was stalled. It became extremely slow, and no amount of effort could move it closer.

The Gana Goddess’ gold light became solid. The powerful weaponry and powers wielded against it could not defy that tangible light. Nothing was even able to scrape the statue.

Gold Jade King wasn’t the only one suffering this suppression, either. The same thing was happening to the other Kings there, as well.

A beast King was trying to bite it in the air. The creature’s fangs had the power to crush mighty objects, and it looked likely to break the statue with its maw. But it was ultimately unable to, as its bite was stopped two meters away. It did not matter how hard it tried, its power wasn’t sufficient to deliver the attack.

A giant-looking King was holding a mighty hammer. The hammer was coming down on the statue. Every swing broke the air, but it could not break the statue. It never got closer than two meters from it.

Amidst those six Kings, Han Sen saw a bald monk. He wore monkish garb, like a robe. He struck the statue with the shadow of a buddha.

The same thing occurred to the monk as it did the other Kings, too. The godlight could not be broken.

The six wielded an extreme amount of strength. Together, they kept pounding on the statue. If it was a planet they were striking, it would have exploded many times over.

If they were unable to break the Goddess statue’s godlight, the power gap between a deified being and a King must have been rather large.

“What about the Nobles in the hall?” Han Sen looked around. Aside from the six Kings attacking the statue, they were all gone.

Guya said, “Where the statue shines, there won’t be any Purgatory Beasts and hellish hands. Ordinary people cannot withstand basking in that light for too long, though. I can only assume they were blasted and dragged into purgatory that way.”

“Guna, is there a way to stop Purgatory Heaven?” Han Sen asked Guna.

Guna looked at the statue and the elites, and she said, “I want to sacrifice myself, and hopefully obtain control of it that way. Then, I can ensure Guya gets out of Purgatory Heaven. In attacking the statue, however, they have increased its power output. Even if I do sacrifice myself, doing so now would be useless.”

“You are so cruel! You only want to have Guya escape this place, while everyone else is left behind?” Wang Yuhang was so mad!”

You guys are not nice. Whoever comes here has a reason to do so. They want to use us,” Guna hummed.

This is not the time to talk about this, so let me ask again: do you have a way?” Han Sen frowned.

“No! The statue has been activated. Not even a King can get close to it. Unless someone deified is here, we will all die,” Guna said.

“Is there no other way?” Han Sen asked, as he looked at the statue.

Guna hummed and said, “Yes. The other way is what the Kings are attempting. Break the godlight and take control of Purgatory Heaven the hard way; only then can you stop it.”

“How do I control it?” Han Sen asked.

“It is difficult to control Purgatory Heaven if you don’t have the blood of the Gana. The same would apply even if you were deified. But underneath the statue, there is a crack. You can escape Purgatory Heaven that way. That is what they planned to do, but they underestimated its power,” Guna said, while pointing at the statue.

Han Sen looked in the direction she pointed to. The end of the statue’s tail did indeed possess a tear in the fabric of space. There was a long mark there.

“That mark is where our deified elites fought their enemies. After a million years, it has yet to heal. That is why there is such a blatant flaw. Unfortunately, only deified elites can make use of it. King class elites cannot, so we most certainly can’t,” Guya said.
