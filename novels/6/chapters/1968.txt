Chapter 1969 Becoming an Earl

The seventh floor’s Jade Air flowed out like a liquid. It hung visibly in the air.

Han Sen used Petrify to turn his flesh into stone, so he didn’t feel it very much when the Jade Air connected with his body. He used The Story of Genes to absorb the Jade Air.

Thousand Feather Crane, Yun Sushang, and First Day all turned to look at Han Sen. The average Earl couldn’t withstand the seventh floor’s Jade Air, and Han Sen was just a Viscount. It was likely he would turn into a jade statue. Thousand Feather Crane prepared to carry Han Sen out the moment he looked like he was in trouble.

But the three of them were shocked when Han Sen petrified himself. The Jade Air didn’t affect Han Sen’s body much, and as they watched, Han Sen began to absorb it. That was surprising.

“What is that geno art? It can allow a Viscount to withstand the Jade Air on the seventh floor?” Yun Sushang was in shock.

Thousand Feather Crane stumbled slightly as he answered. “It looks like some sort of petrifying geno art, but no matter how strong it is, it shouldn’t be this effective on a Viscount. That geno art cannot be a simple petrification. It must be a geno art Knife Queen gave him.”

The three did not observe Han Sen for long. They were still curious, but they needed to focus on their own practice.

The seventh floor’s Jade Air could not harm Han Sen while he was petrified. After he used Petrify, his body had great compatibility with Jade Air, so it was easy to absorb.

The Jade Air rushed into Han Sen’s body like water. He cast The Story of Genes in the hopes he would break through with it.

Spell Armor automatically appeared around Han Sen’s body and wrapped him up. The armor shone with a weird light, and mysterious symbols appeared across it. It was scary.

The other three saw the movement around Han Sen, and when they looked at him, their shock deepened. “He’s going to become an Earl here?”

Han Sen had eaten a lot of grains of Galaxy Sand. He had already been on the precipice of becoming an Earl, but he had lacked a trigger.

The Jade Air would finish what the Galaxy Sand had started. Galaxy Sand was a concentrated xenogeneic gene essence, and it could be absorbed right away.

Jade Air was like ore, though. It had to be worked and refined before absorption.

When ordinary Nobles absorbed Jade Air, most of it would be wasted and released back into the room. Only small amounts of the Jade Air would actually be absorbed and processed by their bodies.

The Galaxy Sand could be used by low-tier Nobles without side-effects, so it was okay for him to have used as much as he had. But receiving too much Jade Air at once could damage a person’s body.

Luckily, Han Sen did not want to absorb the Jade Air. He just wanted to use the power of the Jade Air to break through. It did not matter if it was refined or not; he just needed the strength of it.

The Jade Air on the seventh floor was strong enough. Waves battered across the threshold of his body, activating the power Spell possessed. It had managed to kickstart the evolution process of him becoming an Earl.

The mysterious Spell armor began to shift and change constantly. Thousand Feather Crane observed the armor’s behavior, but he was unsure what it signified.

When the symbols of Spell became brighter, it was as if the light was coming to life. It came out of the armor, surrounding Han Sen like a group of fairies.

“This is a text spirit. It is like the spirit of our Textless Book. It is a very rare spirit!” Yun Sushang exclaimed, looking at Spell.

“It’s rare, but the Rebate don’t have a geno art like that. What geno art has he been practicing?” Thousand Feather Crane said with a frown. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“No matter what it is, this guy is not as simple as what meets the eye. It is very interesting.” Yun Sushang looked at Han Sen with interest.

First Day looked at Han Sen with curiosity. “Brother Crane, the geno art Han Sen is practicing... How is it when compared to that of the Textless Book?”

Thousand Feather Crane shook his head. “I have not practiced with the Textless Book, and I do not know what Han Sen’s geno art is. It is difficult to tell, but the Textless Book is a skill belonging to Sky Palace. It would not be weaker than any other geno art. You have practiced Truth Spell, and that comes from the Textless Book. And it is a spirit that creates text, so you should know more about it than I do.”

Yes, First Day. Do you think your spirit is weaker or stronger than his?” Yun Sushang asked First Day.

First Day looked very shy, and he said the Buddha catchphrase. “I don’t understand his text, but it feels like it is deeper than my own spirit.”

Yun Sushang and Thousand Feather Crane were shocked to hear this. The Textless Book was a skill not every one of the Sky could use. It had many requirements for its practice. So, while Yun Sushang and Thousand Feather Crane were smart, they were still unable to practice with it.

Although only a few could use the Textless Book in its original form, there was a senior inside Sky Palace that had extracted a part out of it that everyone could practice. It was called Truth Spell, and even the ordinary Sky could use it.

While Truth Spell was just a small part of the Textless Book, it was strong enough to be on par with other famous geno arts. First Day was very good with it, and his talent was plain to see. If he felt this way, then it meant Han Sen’s geno art had to be very strong.

When Han Sen evolved, Spell’s spirit became stronger. While the symbols spun around, a vortex was created. It absorbed the Jade Air ravenously, draining the power into Han Sen’s body.

Pang!

A symbol shattered, and the others that were flying around him blew up like a load of firecrackers. They were all broken.

Thousand Feather Crane and the others were shocked. They thought Han Sen had failed, but then, a giant Spell body appeared behind him. It was protecting him.

Pang!

That Spell broke, too. The fragments became a number of smaller Spells, which landed on the armor. Then they disappeared.

Thousand Feather Crane was shocked, and Han Sen didn’t know whether he had succeeded or failed. But quickly, an impressive power started to radiate from Han Sen. When the others saw it, they knew for certain that Han Sen had succeeded in becoming an Earl.

“Spell Battle Body has become an Earl.”

The voice echoed through Han Sen’s mind, filling him with joy. After much hard work, The Story of Genes had been brought up to Earl.
