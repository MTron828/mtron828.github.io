Chapter 2746 Buried Dragon Sea

Now that they had the Sit and Forget Sutra, Li Keer and Exquisite had no more time to follow Han Sen around. The two of them had to relinquish all their other duties and focus on practicing. They needed to take the time to practice the Sit and Forget Sutra now, while their memories were still fresh.

Han Sen wasn’t keen on focusing on the Sit and Forget Sutra. Although the geno art was certainly amazing, its style wasn’t very suitable for him.

Han Sen had learned the Under the Sky mind, and that meant he was walking a road that went against the Sit and Forget Sutra. He wasn’t willing to traverse the Sit and Forget Sutra’s old path. He only used the Sit and Forget Sutra to finish his Under the Sky. Once he did that, his Under the Sky mind had a breakthrough.

“Deified xenogeneic gene consumed. Deified gene +1, evolution progress 1/100.”

Since he was now unwatched by the two women, Han Sen brought out the deified genes he had hidden. Now that he was deified, he was able to absorb and refine them, allowing their powers to develop and reinforce his body.

Over the course of the next few days, Han Sen did little else. Han Sen consumed all of the deified genes that he had saved up. By the end, he had eaten 23 deified genes.

Every deified gene boosted the fitness of Han Sen’s body. He was now even stronger than he had been before.

“It looks like the deified rank works the same as the others. If I get a hundred deified genes, I can make my body evolve. Luckily, the body of one deified xenogeneic can provide up to ten deified genes. It shouldn’t be difficult to get 100. Outer Sky has many deified xenogeneics roaming about. At this point, why should I wait?” Han Sen thought, realizing that there was nothing to stop him from killing deified xenogeneics.

He brought out his map of Outer Sky. He researched the deified xenogeneics that were in the vicinity and where he might find them. When he was done, he made the decision to head to the Buried Dragon Sea to hunt xenogeneics.

Legends claimed that a true god class dragon had once fallen into the sea. Whether or not that was true was up for debate, but high-class deified xenogeneics rarely appeared near the Buried Dragon Sea.

That was the main reason that Han Sen decided to go to the Buried Dragon Sea. Not many deified xenogeneics were born there, so it would be a safer place than most for Han Sen to hunt.

Han Sen had expected to have a difficult time convincing Bao’er to stay behind, but he only had to speak one sentence before Bao’er was agreeing. To Han Sen’s utter astonishment, she didn’t insist on going to Buried Dragon Sea with him. It caught Han Sen completely off-guard.

He looked at the Six-Eared Macaque. Its face looked terrible. Its neck was buried between raised shoulders, and it seemed to be trying to hide from everything in sight. Han Sen finally understood; Bao’er had found herself a new toy.

Han Sen allowed Bao’er to look after the Star Tree while he was gone. After he readied himself, he set out for the Buried Dragon Sea.

When he reached the outskirts of the sea, he saw people fighting in the distance. When he got a little closer to see what was going on, he saw that it was Princess Bai Wei of the Extreme King. Her presence gave him a shock.

Upon seeing Han Sen, Bai Wei said nothing. She kept fighting the half-deified flying fish xenogeneic. After she killed the xenogeneic, she remained atop the waves, staring back at Han Sen.

“Princess Bai Wei. Long time no see. What are you doing all the way out here?” Han Sen said with a cough.

Bai Wei had been the one who first took Han Sen to the Extreme King. That seemed like a long time ago now. There, Han Sen had murdered Prince Bai Yi and stolen the dead man’s identity. For the longest time, he allowed Bai Wei to believe that Bai Yi had killed him instead. On top of that, Han Sen now had a terrible relationship with the Extreme King. It was quite awkward for them to meet now.

“You can be a Very High silkworm, but I cannot?” Bai Wei said coldly. Her eyes flickered with some strange emotion.

Han Sen suddenly understood. After the last silkworm bout, a few of the silkworms had probably been cast away. Bai Wei must have been one of the replacement silkworms.

Han Sen realized that he had no idea what to say. His relationship with Bai Wei was too strange for him to formulate a sentence. They were once allies, but he killed Bai Wei’s older brother and went on to start a very unpleasant feud with the Extreme King. He didn’t know where they were supposed to go from here.

“You are here to kill xenogeneics in the Buried Dragon Sea?” Bai Wei asked. She seemed to be feeling generous.

“Yes.” Han Sen nodded.

“If you aren’t planning to cause me trouble, then let’s go,” Bai Wei said.

Han Sen was shocked. He hadn’t expected Bai Wei to suggest that they go out and kill xenogeneics together.

“If that’s inconvenient for you, then don’t worry about it,” Bai Wei said when Han Sen didn’t respond or make a move. She was ready to move on without him.

“Why would it not be convenient? Killing xenogeneics with a fair queen would be an absolute pleasure,” Han Sen said quickly.

Bai Wei had once tried to save Bao’er. She had been willing to make great sacrifices to someone she believed to be Bai Yi. Therefore, Han Sen felt as if he owed her one.

“Call me Bai Wei,” Bai Wei said. She looked around and said, “There aren’t many xenogeneics here in the shallow sea. The few that you can find tend to be low level. If you want to kill deified xenogeneics, you are going to have to venture into the deeper recesses of the sea to find them.”

“Let us go to the deep sea, then.” Han Sen wasn’t a very eloquent man, nor was he skilled at small talk. This situation was especially difficult for him since he felt guilty about what he had put Bai Wei through. He wasn’t sure how to relate to her or what the connection between them was supposed to mean, so they didn’t speak as they dove into the deep sea together. The atmosphere was awkward.

They encountered some xenogeneics in the sea, and Bai Wei was able to kill them with ease. She had improved a lot. Although she wasn’t yet deified, she was half-deified. Her performance of the Extreme King’s Shocking Sky Punch wasn’t bad.

After Bai Wei took down a half-deified jellyfish with one punch, Han Sen couldn’t help but compliment her. “I can’t believe I haven’t seen you in so long. You have grown so much.”

Bai Wei gave Han Sen an expressionless glance and said, “You were lower level than me, and now you are deified. I’m still just half-deified. Do you really think that means I’ve been developing quickly?”

Han Sen touched his nose and didn’t say anything.The two of them continued to dive deeper. Not long after, they reached the sea bed and found a weird sea creature that was ten meters long floating above the sand. The creature’s body was flat and colored blue.

Its tail was akin to a lobster’s tail, and pincers curled from the front of its body like a scorpion. Six claws of various lengths hung from its belly.

The xenogeneic looked like a shrimp or a crab. It kind of looked like a scorpion. It was an incredibly strange being, but blue substance chains rose from its body. It was clearly a deified xenogeneic.

Without Exquisite or Li Keer around, Han Sen merrily activated his Dongxuan Sutra. He could detect that the xenogeneic was a primitive deified, so he moved calmly toward it.

Before Han Sen and Bai Wei got close, though, the xenogeneic noticed them. It raised its pincers, and its blue substance chains suddenly exploded. A large portion of the sea was painted dark blue, which somehow clouded Han Sen and Bai Wei’s seven senses. They could no longer tell where the xenogeneic was.

Han Sen frowned. He was about to use his Dongxuan Area, but he suddenly saw Bai Wei’s body shake. The power that protected her vanished, and she fell down through the water.

Han Sen put out his hand and used his power to pull Bai Wei toward him. He picked up her body and saw that her skin looked a bit blue. It was transparent like jade. She’d been hit.
