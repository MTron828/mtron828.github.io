Chapter 2541: Pick for Us

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Han Sen was frozen as he watched Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng’s bodies becoming one. The process was pretty much like how Han Sen could combine himself with Little Angel.

But when Han Sen combined with Little Angel, Han Sen’s body was the primary controller. Little Angel was secondary.

Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng were equals. They completed each other.

Before, whenever Han Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon, he had always thought they were so pretty that any man could fall for them. Even Han Sen caught himself watching them, now and again. After all, everyone liked to admire pretty women.

When Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon completed themselves, Han Sen no longer felt as if he was looking at a human. The beauty of the being that emerged was unearthly. A sword fairy stood in front of him; she was so pretty that she no longer looked like something that belonged in this world.

The black hair spilled down her back like a waterfall. Her eyes were like pools of black water. It looked as if she could see into the bottom of a person’s heart with a mere glance. She could look so deeply into a person that it was almost frightening.

There wasn’t a single blemish on her face, and every inch of it was amazing. If people saw her, they would feel ashamed simply for being in her presence. They would deem themselves unworthy.

Gu Qingcheng was beautiful, but she never used her looks to put pressure on other people. This person now, though, was different. Her divine beauty was naturally suffocating.

Of course, the most oppressive thing about her wasn’t just her looks—it was her scary swordmind.

Han Sen thought he was very good at sword skills. His swordmind could compete with the swordmind of a deified being, after all. But this woman’s swordmind made Han Sen’s swordmind look dim by comparison. It was like comparing a firefly to a bright moon.

“It is a perfect sword fairy,” Han Sen thought, despite the fact that she was holding a white paper umbrella instead of a sword.

“Do you know what I want to do now?” Suddenly, Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng spoke to Han Sen.

“What would you like to do?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.

“Kill you,” the woman said as she looked at Han Sen.

“Stop joking around,” Han Sen said. Although he was pretty sure she wasn’t serious, he couldn’t actually discern her emotions or gauge how she was feeling. Regardless, she did have a proud look about her. Han Sen had never witnessed that level of pride before. She was like some goddess perched in a lofty realm, despising the commoners beneath her. Or anyone who was not worthy of being in her presence.

The woman shook her head and seriously said, “I’m not joking. I really want to kill you. Not just you. I want to kill every living creature in this world. You are all so ugly in my eyes. You are all so imperfect. I cannot accept these imperfections I am forced to witness. I have held it in for so long; stopping myself from killing people.”

Han Sen looked at her with shock. He realized that she wasn’t joking. Right now, he was in trouble.

Pang!

The woman’s body suddenly split in two. Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng splintered into their separate bodies again. They looked very pale and ill.

“Now you know why you must kill one of us and keep our personalities uncombined. If we are one, things will end up that way. We will have a personality that is untouchable and entirely ruthless. That personality is obsessed with perfection, and it will seek out and destroy all it deems imperfect. We combine very well, but there are dark thoughts deep within our genes that are brought to the surface. We can suppress the slaughterous desires for the moment, but we have no idea what the future may bring,” Gu Qingcheng said.

“So, if only one personality is alive, we won’t have this problem?” Han Sen asked with a frown.

Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon nodded. They didn’t want to become murderous perfectionists. Even if it guaranteed survival, that wasn’t a life that they wanted to lead. They would become a demon that sought the destruction of pretty much everything. The rest of their lives would be one of battle.

“What kind of sword fairy is this? It’s just an evil swordswoman.” Han Sen had a wry smile.

Looking at Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng, Han Sen knew he was in trouble. When they combined, they didn’t just have an ugly seek-and-destroy heart: they had a terrifying level of talent that could probably make their sordid wishes come true.

After they combined, they were still King class. But after getting a good look at their willpower, it was easy to guess they would one day become deified. At that point, they would become even more frightening.

Both Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon were supremely talented. Even more frightening, they both had super god bodies. When those combined, they would be even more perfect than they were now.

Han Sen didn’t know how the two super god bodies might exist together, but anything was possible.

Regardless of how exactly the combination happened, their talents would make them scarier than any human or spirit that existed. That was an undeniable fact.

“After you guys combine, will you two still have your super god bodies?” Han Sen asked the pair.

Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon nodded. They didn’t speak, but Han Sen knew how scary the confirmation was.

Elysian Moon looked at Han Sen and said, “I’m sure you understand the gravity of the situation now. If we don’t combine, we will die. We estimate we will live no longer than another year. But if we do agree on a combination, the result still isn’t a good one. We might not die, but many others would. We have killed before, but we find the thought of such a pointless, murderous existence to be abhorrent. We don’t want a life based on killing.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Maybe that won’t happen. Maybe when you do fully combine, that desire to kill will disappear.” Han Sen tried to offer them comforting words.

“That is impossible,” Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng said at the same time.

They looked at each other, and then Elysian Moon said, “We want to live, but we don’t want to become someone like that. So, only one of us can be permitted to live. If a winner doesn’t come about through our battles, then we will allow you to decide. With your involvement, one of us is sure to be a clear victor. You should decide which of us should live.”

Han Sen sat in his chair, unmoving. He hadn’t expected Elysian Moon to say something like this. He was closer to Gu Qingcheng, though. He knew that deep inside of himself, some part of him wished for her to be the one who would live.

But Elysian Moon wasn’t his enemy. He didn’t want her to die.

Han Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng. Gu Qingcheng nodded. Sadly, he said, “Why do you have to make me decide this?”

“Because you are the only one capable of killing us, even if we want to fight back. So, this is a decision only you can make,” Elysian Moon said emotionlessly. She said it as if this was none of her business, like she was reading the headline of a particularly boring newspaper.

Han Sen felt a headache coming on. He was very strong, even here. In the sanctuaries, he was more like a god. It turned out, however, that there were problems even a god couldn’t solve.

“This is harder than choosing between a mother and wife who have fallen into a stream. It is too f*cking hard.” Han Sen couldn’t help but swear.

He wasn’t just deciding who to save. He was deciding who to murder.
