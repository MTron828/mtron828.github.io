Chapter 2236 Notebook

Ice Blue Knight King wanted to find out what had happened. He knew someone inside the Ice Blue Knights had assisted Night River King; otherwise, the Rebate wouldn’t have been able to sneak onto Planet Ice Blue. But there was no evidence to implicate anyone, and as for Edward, nothing could be done at the moment.

Han Sen and his team were put on call at the base. They wouldn’t have to do any wilderness clean-up for a while.

...

“That stupid Night River King! He used an Ancient Warrior Statue, and he still couldn’t kill a few Marquises!” said an Ice Blue Knight who looked ill.

“Night River King wasn’t very smart, but he wasn’t stupid, either. There must have been a good reason for him to lose so dramatically,” Edward said flatly. “It looks like Han Sen poses a graver threat than I first assumed.”

The Ice Blue Knight frowned. “What do we do now? Ice Blue Knight King is on high alert. It will be harder for us to move. If they find the tablet, then all our work will have been for naught.”

Edward shook his head. “Don’t be such a negative Nancy. We’ve learned that Han Sen didn’t give the item to Ice Blue Knight King or Mister White, at least. Even if he did find the tablet, we still have a chance to claim it.”

...

Han Sen was playing with the items he had taken from Night River King. The most valuable trinkets were the two Moon Wheel Blades. They were a good pair of weapons for a King to wield.

Han Sen didn’t need them because he already had his Ghost Teeth Knife, but he was in no rush to sell them. So, he decided to save them for Han Yan.

Little Angel, Zero, and Han Meng’er had their own weapons. They didn’t need an extra pair of knives.

Night River King had also been carrying a King class shield. Sadly, he hadn’t gotten to make use of it.

Those were the only King class treasures that Night River King had with him. Perhaps he was poor, or maybe he just didn’t like carrying his riches around on assassination missions.

The few Duke treasures and materials that Han Sen found were already in storage. Han Sen was going to save them for himself and use them to top up his Duke gene tally.

There was one more thing that caught Han Sen’s attention, though, and it wasn’t a treasure.

Among the things he had stolen from Night River King, he found a box that was around the size of a hand. It drew Han Sen’s attention because the box itself had been made from a King class gene.

The material seemed to be horn or antler, and it was unusually hard. But instead of being turned into a treasure itself, it had merely been used as a storage container.

Strangely, there was nothing precious inside the box. There was only a simple diary.

Han Sen opened the diary, and indeed, it was exactly what it appeared to be. The diary recorded everything Night River King had going on, even the unimportant details of his days.

Han Sen couldn’t believe someone like Night River King would write entries in a diary each and every day.

It didn’t make much sense for the man to place a mere diary inside such a precious box. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Because of this, Han Sen assumed that the diary must be special in some way. He used his Dongxuan Aura and the Purple-Eye Butterfly, but the outcome was disappointing.

It really was just a diary. The Purple-Eye let him see how it was created, and the production was average. It didn’t even come with a bookmark. It had been made from materials that were extremely common in the geno universe. Even the brand that made it was well known. Many people used their products.

“If the diary is really just a dairy, maybe its contents harbor a secret?” Han Sen had difficulty believing that Night River King would write entries in his diary every day for no special reason.

Han Sen skimmed through the contents, but there was nothing interesting. He started to doubt his own judgment.

“Was Night River King really a very sensitive man? Is that why he wrote in his diary each day?” Han Sen put down the diary and looked into the box.

The box was simple. It was made from a King class xenogeneic’s material, and it had no secrets or hidden compartments. It was very plain, not even decorated with any symbols.

“Brother-in-law, is that a diary that you’re reading? Is that what you’ve been doing all day?” Ji Qing approached and smiled at him.

“Mhm. I found it in Night River King’s possessions. I think there must be something important inside, but I can’t find anything,” Han Sen said.

“Let me see. Maybe I can spot something,” Ji Qing said.

Han Sen handed it over. Ji Qing examined the paper and binding briefly, then turned her attention to the content of the entries. A while later, she said, “If I’m not mistaken, he’s been writing in code.”

“What sort of code?” Han Sen asked with some confusion. The diary was written in the common language of the geno universe. He knew every word.

Ji Qing pointed at one of the diary entries. “This is the common language of the geno universe, but when you look closer, there’s a pattern to how he writes. It’s a code of some sort. If you can look the words up, perhaps you will find out what he’s actually saying.”

“Can you break the code for me?” Han Sen asked.

“I only know the basics of cryptography. If I had a list of code words, I could probably make some progress. I can’t do it without a list, though. You should probably contact the Ji family for help with this. We have a code-breaking team, and they are real professionals when it comes to this stuff. They can help you.” Ji Qing passed the notebook back to Han Sen.

Han Sen thought she was right. After he put the diary away, he took the time to pop back to the sanctuary. He gave the diary to Ji Yanran and told her about the difficulty he was having in breaking the code.

After that, Han Sen went to visit his warehouse. He lifted the egg, which was formerly the little red bird, from the keg. He then placed it in the Undying Bird’s Nest, hoping it would hatch soon.

By the time he was done in the warehouse, the Ji family had already sent him a progress report. The patterns in the writing didn’t fit any of the codes they had on record, so deciphering the diary would be difficult. Fortunately, they had been researching the geno universe’s language since Han Sen returned to the sanctuaries for the first time. So, there was still a chance for them to decipher the diary. It would simply take some time.

They asked Han Sen to return in ten days, and by then, they might have made some progress.

There were many people in the base, so Han Sen knew he shouldn’t remain in the sanctuaries for too long. He took the Undying Bird’s Nest and the little red bird’s egg back to the base on Planet Ice Blue.

Ordinary xenogeneic bird eggs took three or four hours to hatch inside the bird’s nest, but the little red bird had been inside the nest for an entire day. And still, it showed no response. Han Sen wondered if the egg might have died.
