Chapter 3230 Fighting a Group Alone

Han Sen explained the situation to them once. “You guys don’t have to worry all that much. Even if the 33 skies are broken and the creatures of another universe invade us, they will be repelled by the rules of this universe. Instead, the 33 skies might harm the universe.”

Han Sen’s return delighted people, but the news he delivered made their joy short-lived. It made them gloomy. “I did not know power could be played like this. This is great. I was worried there wouldn’t be any further chances to level up. After the two universes break, we can break the world too. Why do we have to be afraid of these guys?” Xie Qing King rubbed his palms, ready for a fight.

“By the way, Han Sen, I reached the max level now. I should be just as strong as you. Why don’t we fight? Let’s see the difference between having Break World powers and not having Break World powers.” Xie Qing King looked at Han Sen with excitement.

“And me,” Yi Dong Mu, who had been sitting silently, said.

“And me.” Lin Feng and Huangfu Jing threw their hats into the ring as well. They all focused on Han Sen.

“This isn’t about me wanting to crush you guys, but there is a big difference between being able to break the world and not being able to break the world,” Han Sen said with a smile.

“To see what the gap is, we have to see it first-hand through a fight,” Xie Qing King said as he curled his lips. “In that case, why don’t you call come at me?” Han Sen asked with a squint of his eyes.

“Ha! Ha! You’re the one who said it. Later, don’t cry and complain about us bullying you.” After saying that, Xie Qing King’s strong body flashed. A silver necklace whipped in front of Han Sen.

Yi Dong Mu pulled out his knife. One almost couldn’t see the flash of his knife light. The knife was already around Han Sen’s waist.

Lin Feng was different. He was like a Buddha, using his palm to crush the earth like a mountain or a tsunami breaking against a feeble shoreline.

Huangfu Jing teleported above Han Sen with her beautiful long legs coming to slash Han Sen like a battleax.

The four of them wielded different powers, but each of them was extremely scary. They reached the max level of what the universe was capable of, or perhaps even greater than that.

They all had Super bodies or King bodies. The power they brought was scarier than the creatures of the universe. “We are coming in too.” Han Yan and Gu Qingcheng wanted to join the party. They both swung their swords at Han Sen.

Gu Qingcheng’s sword skills were very overbearing. Han Yan’s sword light was like a sword spirit that carried special power as it came slicing down.

“Ne too!” Qin Xuan’s hand sword was straight, but it had a king path that was hard to describe.

Many powers came slashing toward Han Sen. Although their full powers were not used, one could still see how scary it all was.

Even Sky Palace Leader and Very High Leader were shocked. The people from Space Garden were truly unique beings. They were not like any other creatures of the universe.

If they wanted to, the number of elites they had in Space Garden was enough to conquer the entire geno universe.

In the end, they still looked at Han Sen. They wanted to know how strong the Break World powers Han Sen talked about really were.

Seeing so many scary powers come for him, Han Sen did not look as if he was going to move. He only flicked his finger.

Suddenly, time seemed to move slower. Everyone’s movements looked like they were dragged through a television’s slow-motion scene. In fact, it was not them who were moving slower. It was Han Sen using his Dongxuan Sutra’s Break World power to change the size of the universe’s cogwheels. He made the advancement of time proceed much slower.

“Han Sen, you underestimated us. Do you think changing the speed of time can enable you to beat us?” Xie Qing King roared as his body exploded with silver light. He was like a volcano erupting. The silver flames on his body were burning wildly, making his body break the altered flow of time.

Huangfu Jing’s body teleported through the bindings of the new time speed. She raged even more with her wish to strike Han Sen.

Yi Dong Mu’s eyes looked cold. His hand slashed through time and space. He was not affected by the new speed.

Everyone behaved as if they knew this was going to happen all along. They all used their Super bodies’ power, wanting to teach Han Sen a lesson.

Han Sen was still smiling. Seeing Han Yan’s sword light become a sword spirit that was not affected by the trappings of time made him so happy. He said, “Little Yan has grown up.”

Although this was what he thought, his hands were not remaining idle. As he kept flicking his finger, the universe’s most basic substances were changed. The sizes of the cogwheels were changed as well.

Han Sen stood where he was, totally unmoving. Xie Qing King. Huangfu Jing, Lin Feng, Yi Dong Mu, Han Yan, and the others all went wide alongside their powers. They were all thrown off course. Xie Qing King’s fist struck Yi Dong Mu’s sword to create an explosion that shocked the sky. The two of them were blasted backward.

Huangfu Jing’s legs went up against Lin Feng’s hands like a sky knife coming up against a mountain. The power was discharged, tearing a hole through space.

Han Yan’s sword spirit went against Gu Qingcheng’s sword air. The entire scene was a mess.

Han Sen remained like his usual self, standing where he was. Xie Qing King and the others, however, were at a disadvantage. It led to them looking at Han Sen with shock.

If they learned Han Sen’s power was stronger than them, they were not surprised. Just playing with their powers like that, in which he could control them like dolls, was a particular kind of scary.

This was not just power. It was not on that level. Everyone started to like the concept of Break World powers.

Every creature that came from the sanctuaries was proud. If they knew there was a way for them to improve even further, then that is what they wanted to do.

Sky Palace Leader looked at Very High Leader. They both looked worried. If the Break World elites all demonstrated powers similar to what Han Sen had just shown them, they would be in a lot of trouble if the 33 skies opened. The entire geno universe was going to be thrown into disarray.

“You guys are still so weak,” Han Sen said with a smile. “If you want to fight me, you should learn how to break the world first.”

“It is just breaking a world. It is no big deal. After I break the world, I will fight you again.” Xie Qing King was fine. He shouted and laughed.

“Not bad.” Yi Dong Mu coldly nodded.

Han Sen and the others spoke about things concerning the 33 skies. Once that was done, he was able to be alone. He called over Littleflower and Ling’er to go to the sanctuaries and see Ji Yanran.

Before he used his powers to visit the sanctuaries, someone stopped him. “Han Sen.”

“Mister Bai.” Han Sen quickly bowed.

Mister Bai was the Xuan Men’s only inheritor. He taught Han Sen some skills. Although Mister Bai had never admitted it, Han Sen had always treated him like a teacher.

“I want to see your Break World powers.” Mister Bai was quick to explain to Han Sen the reason why he had gone there.

“Of course, you can see.” Han Sen displayed his Break World power. He used the Dongxuan Sutra to gather up a black light atop his finger.

Mister Bai had a look. He nodded and said, “I see. In that case, take a look at my power. Is that a Break World power?”

After Mister Bai said that, he cooked up a light on his own finger. The light on his fingertip was white. The color was different, but Han Sen sensed that the Dongxuan Sutra’s Break World power was still quite similar to Mister Bai’s Break World power. It just wasn’t exactly the same.

“Mister Bai, when did you learn to break the world?” Han Sen looked at Mister Bai with shock. It was definitely Break World power.

“After I watched you fight World King God, I learned something,” Mister Bai said. “After that, I combined Yin and Yang. I just did not know that was Break World power.”

“You are so strong,” Han Sen said to compliment him.

By watching him and World King God fight, Mister Bai learned how to break the world. Mister Bai, who was a Xuan Men inheritor, was clearly a scary person.
