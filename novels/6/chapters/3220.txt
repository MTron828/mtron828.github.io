Chapter 3221 Is That It?

“The leader really is too powerful.” “Of course, back then, we used all kinds of ways to thrive in Dust Sky. But alas, we couldn’t. Any creature. or even if a God Spirit enters it, they will become commoners. They will not have any more powers to break through the barriers. Only the leader is immune to the Dust Sky suppression. He uses his own power to break Dust Sky. In this universe, only the leader can reach that level.”

“They’re just two humans. No matter how ridiculous they may seem, the leader can kill them with ease.”

“No matter how many times I see this, the leader is always so shock-inducing to watch. It is hard to believe his might.”

In the God Chaos Party’s headquarters, the God Chaos Party members watched this scene with nothing short of surprise.

There were, however, some God Chaos Party members who were stone cold and silent as they watched. Rocky Dee was one such person. His heart was thumping so hard that it felt like it would breach his chest. It was extremely fortunate that Han Sen stopped Bao’er from doing something. He imagined that if she did something particularly eye-catching, it would invoke the interest of Bury Path God. If he was to ever inspect Bao’er and become wary of something odd with her, it could certainly be troublesome.

Rocky Dee frowned and thought, “Damn it! Why did I have to come to the 33 skies? This is an absolute death wish.” He wanted to find a way to save Bao’er.

“In Dust Sky, even if the whole cast of Reboot God Spirits went there, they would be reduced to commoners. This is a place where the rules of the universe cannot touch. There are only a few people who are not afraid of Dusk Sky’s power. Bury Path God is one such person, and so is Master Bao’er. Han Sen and Qin Wan’er’s powers are strong, but they have still been restricted by Dust Sky’s power.” Rocky Dee kept thinking. No matter what he thought, it did not seem as if he could save Bao’er.

If this was in another place, perhaps he would have the chance. In Dust Sky, his power had been restricted. Perhaps there were no powers he could use, but how else would he be able to save her?

Wan’er’s power was becoming weaker. Bury Path God unleashed a rainbow to bind her. No matter how much she struggled or fought, she could do nothing to break the binding rainbow light.

Ever so strangely and profoundly confusing, the gold light that was on her body, despite appearing like it really was just there, wasn’t actually there at all. It was obvious to see that her power had been sapped away. It was incredibly difficult for her to continue fighting in any shape and form.

Bury Path God’s eyes moved. He looked at Wan’er, who was tied up, and said, “Back in the day, your big brother, Qin Xiu, made a big wish. If we helped him break through the walls of the universe so he could go to the other world and find your reborn body, he would follow through with our deal to break through the 33 skies. We eventually lost contact with him, and he never did return. He never adhered to the terms of the deal. If you are his sister, then it must be down to you to do as he promised. Help us break through the 33 skies.

Wan’er did not understand what he was blabbing on about, but her confused eyes seemed to be reduced because of her reverse Super God Spirit mode.

Wan’er stared at Bury Path Sky and asked, “Who are you people? What are you talking about?”

“It does not matter who I am,” Bury Path God overbearingly said. “What matters is that from now on, you are my slave. I can make you do anything, and you have to do as I tell you.”

“I do not know you, so why would I be your slave?” Wan’er asked.

“My name is Bury Path God. I will one day be the master of the universe. All the creatures in this universe will be my slaves. You can be my slave now. You should be honored by the offer.” Bury Path God did not look as if he was joking around. He sounded as if all of this was normal. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Wan’er shook her head. “I am not going to be your slave. My big brother told me we are free humans. It does not matter if we are challenged by gods or demons, but no one can command our souls or enslave our bodies.”

Bury Path God laughed and said, “Qin Xiu really was a crazy man, but I am afraid he cannot protect himself anymore. Otherwise, how could you run out alone like this? You are the person he threw his life away for though.”

When Wan’er heard that, her face changed. “Big Brother... What happened to Big Brother?”

Wan’er tried to remember, but she clutched her head and screamed. It was like something inside her head exploded.

Bury Path God was able to tell what was happening. He coldly laughed and said, “Qin Xiu, that kid, was never too bad. He entered the other world to take back your soul. After combining with your body, it made the soul in your body and memory come back. What a shame. He did one thing wrong. If a soul gets reborn, it means another complete lifeform is forced into another body with a spirit. That means there are two souls in one body. In a situation like that, it is impossible for there not to be conflict.”

Seeing Wan’er holding her head and feeling pain, Bury Path God walked next to her. He reached out his hand and pointed his fingers at Wan’er’s forehead.

“Do not worry. You will not feel this pain soon. That is because your soul will be killed. I only need this body. This body’s unique power is very good for us to break through the 33 skies. I must really thank Qin Xiu. If he had not created a monster body like you, I would not know which year or which month I would be able to break through the 33 skies.” Bury Path Sky’s finger touched Wan’er on the forehead. His fingers went inside it. Some blood came out from the wound.

“Let me go. Otherwise, my brother will never forgive you.” Wan’er felt pain from the wound. She seemed to be more awake. She gnashed her teeth to try and endure the pain she struggled with.

“I, Bury Path God, do things without ever requiring the forgiveness of a mere human. Let’s not say something like Qin Xiu has probably already reincarnated, but even if he is still alive as his old self, before me, he is nothing but a minuscule ant that I can kill randomly.” Bury Path God looked at her with disdain as he spoke. While they were talking, Bury Path God’s fingers went lower. It made Wan’er’s wound bigger. It was like a bloody third eye was now in the center of her forehead.

“Is that it?” A man with a really deep voice emerged from the dust.

Han Sen had not been on the planet long, but he now saw a black shadow slowly approaching. It was the black crystal armor. It was unknown who was wearing it, but it was releasing some weird and black light. The entire universe went dim beneath it. All the while, that figure walked forward. It was like the guy had come from hell.

“Big Brother!” Wan’er looked at the black crystal armor coming closer. She looked very surprised.

When Bury Path God heard her words, his face changed. He looked at the black crystal armor and said, “Qin Xiu, you are still alive.”
