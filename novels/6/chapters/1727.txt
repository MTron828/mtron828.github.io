Chapter 1728 I Want This Person

Hardman and Lena looked as if they were watching a movie. Until the xenogeneic was killed, no one could tell who would take the beast down.

They didn’t think Han Sen could kill the xenogeneic, and he had actually helped them draw it out. He was very nice.

Hardman even lit up a cigarette to enjoy what came next.

Qiao and Lan Se looked at Han Sen and the silver ape, hoping that the soldier she had chosen would be able to deal with the creature. Even though Mister Tiger had joined the fray, there was still a chance that Han Sen could get the kill.

Mister Tiger roared as he ran, holding a tiger head sword. He lifted it as he ran up to the ape.

He was quite a distance from the creature, and before he reached the foe, Han Sen had already run past the ape.

When Han Sen passed the creature, there was a gleam of light across the ape’s neck. It was so small that no one was able to see it.

After he went past it, Han Sen stopped a few steps later.

The big ape quickly turned around and looked at Han Sen furiously. It wanted to roar again.

But when it opened its mouth, it only made noise for a single second. Its red eyes opened wide, as its neck suddenly split open, gushing blood like a fountain. The silver ape clutched its cut neck and fell to the ground as blood began to pool and run around. After a moment of writhing, the beast lay still.

Mister Tiger was only twenty meters away from the ape when he started to slow down. He couldn’t believe what he was witnessing. The ape was on the ground, bleeding profusely.

Qiao and Lan Se looked on in disbelief, remaining quiet in suspense. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Inside the armored truck, Guris’ eyes were shiny. Hardman and Lena had nothing remotely close to a smile, but their eyes were opened wide, staring at the monitor. They were fixed there, unmoving.

It wasn’t until the cigarette burned low enough to scorch Hardman’s hand that he changed. The pain made him stop. He lobbed the remains away, and with a glum look, he asked hopelessly, “How was that possible?”

“Xenogeneic Baron hunted; xenogeneic gene found. Xenogeneic beast soul obtained.”

When Han Sen heard the announcement, he was dumbfounded. He had never expected that killing a xenogeneic could grant him a beast soul.

“Nice job!” Before Han Sen could check out the beast soul, Qiao and Lan Se came forward to compliment him giddily.

Qiao had faith in Han Sen, and she had placed her hope in his abilities. But she still hadn’t gotten used to Han Sen, and his performance made her believe she was dreaming.

Lan Se looked at Han Sen in exuberant excitement. She did not have a geno armament, but she was absolutely thrilled to see Han Sen perform so well.

Then Mister Tiger approached. Qiao’s face changed as she moved to block him. She waved her phone and said, “Mister Tiger, it’s fairly obvious who this belongs to. I have sent a video to the official website already. The video is already uploaded, so please go.”

Mister Tiger laughed and said, “I’m not the kind of person who would try something so cheap.”

Mister Tiger looked at Han Sen and gave him a thumbs up. “That was good.”

“Thank you, Mister Tiger. If we ever have the time, we should chat about sword skills together.” Han Sen might not have liked Hardman, but that did not mean he disliked everyone that belonged to Black Gold Group. Hardman didn’t represent the individuals in his employ.

“Sounds good. Give me your number, and I’ll give you a call sometime,” Mister Tiger said.

Han Sen gave him his phone number. Mister Tiger then looked over to the body of the silver ape. After that, he looked to Qiao’s broken car, laughed, and said, “There’s no one else in the area, but I can give you a ride out of here.”

In Black Gold Group’s meeting room, the video of Han Sen slaying the ape played repeatedly. It was slowed down, on a perpetual loop of playback.

Hardman, Lena, Guris, Mister Tiger, and Allan were all there together. There was also a young man in the host’s seat.

The young man watched, while everyone else didn’t say a word. They just watched the video with him.

Finally, the young man paused the video. He looked at Hardman and calmly said, “Manager Hard, was this man once a member of a Black Gold hunting team?”

Hardman developed a cold sweat, and he said, “Third Master, this man failed to become a Noble. Qiao offered us a decent price, so...”

“I want this person,” the third master said. He stood up. “I’m going to join the next meeting. I’ll be back in half a month, when I am, I’ll see him standing in front of me.”

After that, the third master left along with his people.

Hardman sat down on a chair. His expression looked awful.

“Manager Hard, you are in trouble.” Guris patted him on the shoulder.

“You acquired Han Sen, but then you went and sold him. Why would you do such a thing?” Mister Tiger was mocking Hardman, and not even he was happy about the fact that Hardman had shamelessly sold Han Sen off.

“Why don’t we just buy him back? With Black Gold’s power, we can guarantee his return to the fold. He is merely a commoner wielding a xenogeneic weapon. I’m not really sure what the third mister thinks he sees in him.” Lena lifted her lips in a sneer.

“Shut up.” Before Mister Tiger could speak again, Hardman stopped Lena.

Hardman was not a big-boobed woman with no brains; he was a very smart man. He knew what the third master had seen in Han Sen’s performance. He knew the weapon was not the only thing that Han Sen wielded.

He had offended Han Sen many times, so he wasn’t sure if he could get Han Sen back. But he had to commit to the order given to him by the third master. He didn’t even want to think about the consequences of failure.

Hardman looked very nervous. Aside from Lena, everyone else eventually left. No one was able to help him out of this predicament, after all.

The silver ape’s body was in the warehouse. Han Sen did not have time to look at it, as he was investigating the xenogeneic beast soul.
