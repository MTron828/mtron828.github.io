1982 Under the Sky

Han Sen felt that the Jade Air had become very pure. It allowed his Jadeskin to ascend in level very quickly. But the Jade Air’s time of eruption was far too short for satisfaction. When the Jade Air dispersed, Han Sen wanted more.

“What is your name?” Han Sen opened his eyes and saw the arrogant man looking at him. His voice sounded cold.

“Han Sen. What is your name? And do you want something?” Han Sen asked.

“Are you taking part in the exam this year?” The man did not answer Han Sen’s question, and just asked his own again. Han Sen thought the man was quite strange, so he willingly answered. “I don’t know. Maybe. Maybe not.”

“Oh.” The man looked at Han Sen and then left, headed downstairs.

“Is he crazy?” Han Sen shrugged his shoulders, then went downstairs as well.

When Han Sen reached the sixth floor, the man had vanished. He saw Yu Jing looking around, however. Yu Jing approached Han Sen as soon as his eyes found him.

“Han Sen, are you free? Can we talk?” Yu Jing said.

“I don’t think so; I have something to do. Come over to my place tonight,” Han Sen said, recalling that he was supposed to meet up with Yun Suyi.

“Okay,” Yu Jing agreed, then walked downstairs with Han Sen.

When they reached the fourth floor, Yun Suyi was waiting there for Han Sen. She smiled at him.

“Brother Han is meeting up with a woman? It is best that I leave!” Yu Jing saw Yun Suyi, smiled back, and then said goodbye.

“Why are you with him?” Yun Suyi asked, frowning.

“Why? Is there a problem?” Han Sen asked with confusion. She looked as if matters with Yu Jing weren’t so simple.

“That guy is greedy. He plays tricks, and he cheats. He does not have a very good reputation in Sky Palace. I recommend staying away from him, if you can.” Yun Suyi told Han Sen some stories about things he had done.

Yun Suyi then brought Han Sen over to her island. Her island was far bigger than his. She had a pavilion, and even a garden with a fountain. It was quite a comfy place, really.

“Here, then. Help me examine this skill. Which part of it is incorrect? I always feel as if there is something amiss with it.” Yun Suyi brought Han Sen into a pavilion in the garden. She invited Han Sen to sit down and drink some tea.

Han Sen answered, “Show me the knifeskill, and I’ll see if I can identify the issue.”

Yun Suyi nodded. Her beautiful body walked to the fields. She pulled out a knife and began her performance.

Han Sen watched her and frowned. Yun Suyi hadn’t been practicing the skill for very long, so she wasn’t experienced at all. If there was a problem, it would be because of her lack of practice. She could not even be considered a beginner with the skill.

Han Sen realized that she had not used a knife before, so she did not have much in the way of knifeskills. It was clear to him that she had only started practicing this as a way to talk to Han Sen. It was an excuse.

Yun Suyi had not just selected a random skill to trick Han Sen, though. It’d have been too obvious if she had done that.

The knifeskill she had selected was called “Under the Sky.” It was created by a Sky Palace swordsman. He wanted to create a knifeskill for Sky Palace, but in the end, there were seven problems he was unable to solve. That was why he called the knifeskill Under the Sky, because it was not on the level expected of the Sky.

Many people wanted to modify Under the Sky. The seven little issues had been fixed over the years by a series of genius students, but there was still one problem no one could overcome. Because of that, they were unable to make it a Sky Palace skill.

Yun Suyi selected this skill in the hope that Han Sen could identify the issue that was thus far unfixable. If she did that, it’d work as an icebreaker, allowing her to get closer to him. If she had to keep looking him up all the time, with no real reason, her feelings would be revealed.

Han Sen could tell Suyi had just started practicing with a knife, but he was still fascinated by the knifeskill. It was amazing in its own right, and it was vastly different from Teeth Knife.

Han Sen thought the knifeskill had the same potential as Teeth Knife, but when Suyi performed it, there was clearly a problem with it. And also, the power in the example was quite weak.

It was just one little problem, but it detracted so much from the technique. The resolution of a battle between two elites rested on the smallest details, so the slightest edge could make the difference between life and death.

“Han Sen, can you tell that there is a problem with this skill? I feel as if something is wrong.” After Yun Suyi practiced, she returned to the pavilion and consulted Han Sen.

Because Under the Sky was still not perfect, Sky Palace did not really allow its students to practice it. Only a select few had knowledge of the skill’s existence. She knew Han Sen had never seen the skill before, and so that was why she chose to use it.

But even if the skill was perfected, it wouldn’t be made available to all students. Most people would only hear the name.

Han Sen didn’t think much about it. He just believed Yun Suyi had yet to practice it right, and that was why there was an issue. He didn’t think there was an issue with the knifeskill itself. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

This technique is very complicated, so I don’t understand it yet. Could you perform it again for me?” Han Sen did not ask to see the scroll.

The skill was Teeth Knife’s equal, so it was unlikely many students had what it took to practice with it. He was just an outsider, so asking to read the actual geno art could have been very rude.

Yun Suyi merrily agreed to perform Under the Sky again.

“There are some problems, certainly, but I don’t really understand them. I’ll think it over when I head back.” Han Sen did not focus on the use of knives, so he wasn’t a knife master. He could not promise that he would fix the problem.

But there were some common aspects threading every skill, and Han Sen had a great deal of knowledge and experience. So, he planned on trying to solve it. Tackling the problem would be good for his own knife practice, regardless of whether he succeeded or failed.

After all, Han Sen used knives more than any other weapon these days. And he had Ghost Teeth Knife, which was a King weapon. He wanted more knife skills.

Yes, please.” Yun Suyi smiled and took Han Sen back. She planned to use this excuse to talk to Han Sen about knifeskills again. She wanted to get closer to him.

When Yun Suyi returned home from taking Han Sen back to his island, Yun Sushang appeared in her garden.

“Suyi, what have you done?”

“Nothing. I had a problem with a skill, so I asked Han Sen for help. I took him home right after.” Yun Suyi acted as if she did not care.

Yun Sushang looked at Yun Suyi and said, “The problem with Under the Sky cannot be fixed through simple observation. If he can do that, then the elders wasted their lives in what they have done.”

Yun Suyi blushed, and she said, “Sister, why are you spying on our conversations?”

“Suyi, do not forget your identity. You should know what you can do and what you cannot. There is a line. Han Sen is not of the Sky. Wanting something impossible will just get someone hurt.” Yun Sushang sighed.
