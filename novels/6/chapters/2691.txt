Chapter 2692 For Your Convenience

In his writing in the notebook, even Mister White had admitted that his thoughts on the Xuan Yellow Sutra were only theories. He hadn’t tested any of these predictions in the real world. To find out how much power the geno art would really have, Han Sen would have to practice it.

Mister White did mention, however, that there were risks associated with practicing the Xuan Yellow Sutra. The geno art could theoretically reverse a person’s bloodline, but doing so would be very dangerous. Attempting such a feat would have consequences throughout Han Sen’s body. If his body was unable to withstand those effects, the ramifications could be dire.

Han Sen was very tempted to learn it because of the scary powers that the Xuan Yellow Sutra offered, but the risks were severe enough to make him hesitate.

“Since I don’t need to practice the Xuan Yellow Sutra and I don’t actually need to use it, there is no point in me trying to reverse my bloodline.” After Han Sen came to this conclusion, he decided to put the Xuan Yellow Sutra out of his mind.

Now, he turned his attention back to the xenogeneic in Jail Demon Hall. He had less than a month to go. If he was unable to kill it in that amount of time, then he would lose this opportunity. He would need to wait for the next doppelganger to show up before he could fight it again.

“How can I kill it, then? I will have to wait until Li Keer and Exquisite are somewhere else so I can try to kill it with a different geno art. That’s my best chance,” Han Sen thought to himself.

When he left the core area, Li Keer was there waiting for him in the oasis.

“Why are you back here so soon?” Li Keer wasn’t worried like she had been the last time. She was actually surprised to see him return so quickly.

In truth, she had been hoping that Han Sen would stay in the core area until the xenogeneic in Jail Demon Hall was killed.

“I was just meeting up with a friend. I don’t have much time. I need to kill that xenogeneic in Jail Demon Hall, so I couldn’t stay there for very long,” Han Sen said.

“You’re really going to keep trying, aren’t you? You’re planning on returning to Jail Demon Hall,” Li Keer said to Han Sen.

“Why shouldn’t I keep going there? It is rare to tackle such a powerful enemy, and it isn’t as if I have to worry about my safety. This is the perfect opportunity for me to hone my skills,” Han Sen said with sincerity.

Li Keer looked at Han Sen, her head tilted slightly to the side. She could sense that Han Sen was speaking the truth.

No matter which race they came from, ordinary people would struggle to maintain their drive and dedication in the face of such overwhelming failure. Most people could only have their dreams crushed so many times before they gave up.

Han Sen had failed many times already, but he hadn’t been broken down. His resolve was strong, and he clearly intended to keep on going. That sort of personality had its upsides and downsides, that was for sure.

Li Keer opened her mouth to say something, but no words materialized. She didn’t want to destroy Han Sen’s positivity.

“Whatever. There is only a month left. With his unbreakable determination, it shouldn’t bode too ill for him,” Li Keer thought to herself.

After returning to Jail Demon Hall, Han Sen continued to challenge that xenogeneic every day. And every day, he kept failing.

After two weeks had passed, Li Keer and Exquisite rarely visited anymore. He had failed far too many times, and he had yet to learn anything new. There was no reason for them to spend time watching such pointless fights.

While he was occupied doing his own thing, the girls wanted to practice the knife skill Under the Sky, which they had learned from Han Sen. Although their mental access to Han Sen’s personal experience made it easier for them to cast the powerful skill, they were still having difficulty getting anywhere close to the talent Han Sen had with the skill.

“He is very talented when he fights. This kind of knife skill and knifemind are very rare to see. He should be a great help for us when practicing the Very High Sense,” Li Keer complimented.

“It is a shame he isn’t one of the Very High. Otherwise, with his level of talent, he might be able to practice the Very High Sense,” Exquisite said, her voice carrying a distinct note of regret.

Li Keer sneered slightly. “What is good about practicing the Very High Sense, anyway? I don’t want to become one of those cold-blooded monsters. If I was given the choice, I would have never decided to practice it, at all.”

“It is because you have a ten armor talent. Those with an armor talent that high must practice the Very High Sense. That is the rule of being one of the Very High,” Exquisite said.

“But why me? I really wish my talents were below nine armors,” Li Keer grumbled.

Han Sen lost his next fight. He stumbled out of Jail Demon Hall, covered with injuries. But then, he suddenly saw a Very High man standing outside the hall looking at him.

Han Sen didn’t recognize this Very High, but the man’s eyes definitely looked hostile.

“This guy can’t be Li Xue Cheng, can he?” Han Sen thought to himself.

In his time in Outer Sky, Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng were the two people he had offended the most. He had seen Liyu Zhen before, but he had never seen what Li Xue Cheng looked like. Even if this man wasn’t Li Xue Cheng, he was probably related to those two.

“Han Sen, you have been using Jail Demon Hall for two months. If you cannot kill the Red Blood Demon, then get out of there. Don’t waste people’s time,” Li Xue Cheng said, staring at Han Sen.

Li Xue Cheng and Liyu Zhen had lost everything after the silkworm fights. All they had left were their undies. Their parents had helped them pay back most of their debts, but they still owed a lot to a lot of people.

Right now, the two men had nothing. Literally nothing. Even the resources they needed for practice had to be used as payment for others.

Li Xue Cheng had the idea of fighting the Red Blood Demon. The Red Blood Demon xenogeneic gene was required in order to craft a particular deified treasure. If he could get his hands on that xenogeneic gene, then Li Xue Cheng could use it to earn more resources.

Li Xue Cheng couldn’t kill the Red Blood Demon alone, but he had his family backing him. If his family helped, he could probably take down the Red Blood Demon.

But when Li Xue Cheng went to Open Sky Elder to request admittance to Jail Demon Hall, he was told that Han Sen had already registered there to be the one that killed it. He would have to wait until Han Sen failed before applying again.

Li Xue Cheng didn’t believe Han Sen had what it took to slay the Red Blood Demon, so he came to the Jail Demon Hall to see how things were progressing. And there, he found Han Sen getting repeatedly wrecked by the Red Blood Demon.

“Exquisite told me I still have a month to go from the time I was allotted when I was signed up. Is that incorrect?” Han Sen asked coldly, meeting at Li Xue Cheng’s gaze.

“If you don’t have the required power, another month won’t make any difference. Why not just give up now? Save yourself some time and stop inconveniencing others,” Li Xue Cheng shot back.

“I see. You say ‘others,’ but you really just want me to do something that will benefit you,” Han Sen said to Li Xue Cheng, squinting slightly.

“You are correct. Rather than staying here and wasting everyone’s time, just quit and save us all the trouble,” Li Xue Cheng said flatly. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“You are right. Making the lives of others more convenient is a nice thing to do. I shouldn’t waste someone else’s time. I should have finished here sooner,” Han Sen said with a nod. He looked like he was agreeing with what Li Xue Cheng said.

“That is a reasonable way of thinking. If you want to cancel your registration, you must visit Open Sky Elder. I can take you there, if you want,” Li Xue Cheng said, expecting Han Sen to genuinely throw in the towel.

“No, no, no. You misunderstood me. I will kill the Red Blood Demon. Therefore, there will be no need for you to waste more time waiting for me,” Han Sen said with a laugh.
