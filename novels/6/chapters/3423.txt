Chapter 3424: Demon Alpha’s Secret

The shadow of the God Spirit light kept slashing the scary cause power, but it was unable to bring harm to Han Sen. Many cause powers came before Han Sen, but they immediately vanished. They could not cover his body.

“Demon Alpha, do you want this to continue?” Han Sen kept getting the cause power attack as he spoke to Demon Alpha.

Demon Alpha’s eyes were consistently full of shock. She could not believe her cause powers were unable to work on Han Sen.

“There is no need.” Demon Alpha looked very calm. The God Spirit powers on her were weaker. She looked at Han Sen with a complex look.

“Can you tell me who that God Spirit was now?” Han Sen whispered to Demon Alpha.

Demon Alpha hesitated. She used a weird skill so that her words were only able to be heard by Han Sen. “What if I told you that I do not know who this God Spirit was. Would you believe me?”

Han Sen frowned and looked at Demon Alpha. He did not speak. He did not believe Demon Alpha, but people like Demon Alpha must have had a reason to say something like that.

Demon Alpha said, “Back in the day, Ancient Devil took eight of us, the generals, with him to summon a God Spirit. We summoned a dying God Spirit. Even Ancient Devil does not know who that God Spirit was. If he did not know, how could we possibly know? Ancient Devil and the rest of us used all sorts of methods, but we were unable to do anything to the dying God Spirit.”

Han Sen nodded. The explanation of events given to him by Demon Alpha, Asura, was the same as the explanation given to him by Ancient Devil.

Demon Alpha bore a wry smile and went on to say, “You must be curious. If we could not hurt the dying God Spirit, how was I able to consume it? Well, that is very simple. That is because it was not that I ate the God Spirit. It was more like he chose me.”

Han Sen looked at Demon Alpha with surprise as he asked, “What is that supposed to mean?”

“It means what you just heard me tell you. Ancient Devil and the other generals believed that I ate the God Spirit, but they did not know he chose to combine with me above the rest.” Demon Alpha saw Han Sen’s face, knowing what he was thinking. She shook her head and said, “I know what you are thinking. I am still me. The God Spirit did not overtake me. The God Spirit was very strong. If he wanted to take over my will, I would have been unable to stop him. But he never did. Instead, he gave his powers to me. The power was so strong that I was only ever to use some of it. As I became stronger, I became more and more able to use the power. Recently, I was able to use it perfectly.”

“Aside from this power, do you have anything else?” Han Sen found all of this hard to believe. Demon Alpha was stretching the limits of his believability.

Even if the God Spirit was that nice, he didn’t believe a good God Spirit was that perfect and unselfish to never plan on bringing harm to Demon Alpha. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He gave his power to Demon Alpha to prolong his life. It was obvious he just did not want to die, so he must have left behind some final words.

Han Sen would not believe there was nothing more to it all.

Demon Alpha said, “He left me a message, but his message did not concern anything to do with himself. It was a secret that had something to do with Human Alpha.”

Demon Alpha hesitated for a moment but proceeded to say, “You should know that Qin Xiu was Human Alpha reincarnated. I lost. I cannot fight him before Qin Xiu controls the geno tablet. I can tell you this secret. If you can defeat Qin Xiu, it will only be a good thing for me too.”

Han Sen was happy. He did not expect Demon Alpha was connected to all of this. It certainly came as a surprise to him. It made him really curious too. He did not know what kind of secret this was.

Demon Alpha was silent a moment before saying to Han Sen, “According to my message, Human Alpha does not die. Before he walked that step, there was a small flaw in him. If you can catch that flaw, it might be possible for you to defeat him.”

Han Sen could not help but ask, “What flaw might that be?”

Demon Alpha’s voice was in Han Sen’s brain. “Human Alpha’s genes come from a Reboot God Spirit and the last God Chaos Party leader. The two of their genes did not combine perfectly. If Human Alpha was forced to combine the geno prototype armor and a Reboot Blood-Pulse, it will have a flaw. If you can catch the flaw, Qin Xiu can be delivered deadly damage. But catching that flaw will be difficult. You will need my cause power for that since this flaw can only be felt. It cannot be spoken. Without my cause power, you will not be able to see the flaw. So, this secret is pointless for you to learn.”

Upon hearing all of this, Han Sen was more and more shocked. It was not because of the flaws Demon Alpha mentioned. It was because by knowing this and wanting to deal with Human Alpha, this could not be Human Alpha reincarnated.

Knowing so much about Human Alpha’s secrets, the God Spirit that combined with Demon Alpha sounded like the last God Hall Leader.

“If it was that big god, how was he able to be summoned to a low-level sanctuary by Ancient Devil?” Han Sen really did not understand this part.

Demon Alpha said, “I still have a feeling the God Spirit I combined with was just a shell or fragment of its former self. It is not the God Spirit in its entirety.”

“What do you mean by that?” Han Sen asked.

“It is just a feeling! The God Spirit is a spirit body. If he really combined with me, I should be able to get some memory from his soul, but I can’t.” Demon Alpha smiled. She went on to speak, but this time, her voice was not directly in Han Sen’s brain. Everyone was able to hear what she said next. “Our discussion ends here. I lost. This is where we say goodbye. I hope I will meet you again one day—alive.”

After that, Demon Alpha left the 33 skies.

“Holy sh*t! What was that? They did not fight. This was so fake.”

“I object! This was a fake fight.”

“Hey! Hey! You guys should at least pretend to fight. You did not even fight. All you did was wave your hands, and then one of you concedes? That is so unprofessional.”

“Fake! This is so fake! This acting is noob level!”

There were so many boos after this. People thought it was not a glorious win for Han Sen. Even the races of the geno universe that adored Han Sen looked weird. They were so perplexed that they could not speak.

Han Sen did not care though. The secrets Demon Alpha told him gave him a lot to think about, but there was no way to confirm anything. It was like his heart had been scratched by a cat, and it was incredibly itchy as a result.

When Demon Alpha quit, Han Sen progressed to the top 16. He could not, however, leave the 33 skies. He had no choice but to wait until the next fight.

He had to win that next fight. He had to keep on fighting. There was no other choice.
