Chapter 3205 The History Behind Inch Grey Sword

Han Sen and Bao’er were happily having hot pot. Suddenly, something shook inside the fanny pack across Bao’er’s waist. Bao’er opened it up. A book leaped out of it.

The pages quickly opened and flipped themselves until the shape of a black, human silhouette jumped onto the table. It pointed at Han Sen and shouted, “Han Sen! Han Sen! Can’t you just stay home? Why did you have to go to Soldier Knife Sky to kill Weapon God? Do you have a death wish or something? Now, the temporary leader has tasked me with killing you in the next three days. What am I supposed to do?”

“There is no need to rush this,” Han Sen said with a smile. “You are a gentleman. How can you be so rude and hasty?”

“Hmph!” Rocky Dee coldly grunted and said, “The leader has demanded that you be killed. What are you going to do about that?”

“How am I supposed to know what to do? Why don’t you think of a way out of this instead?” Han Sen asked with a smile.

“Why would I wipe your ass for you?” Rocky Dee coldly retorted.

“In that case, you might as well just come and kill me,” Han Sen said while opening the palms of his hand. Rocky Dee was furious. He madly said, “Do not think I would not dare kill you. If it was not for Master Bao’er, I would have killed you 10,000 times over by now.”

After he was done venting, Rocky Dee said, “No matter what, I must implore that you do not leave the walls of Jade Wall City. The Qin Kingdom has four Annihilation God Spirits protecting the place, and two of the Annihilation-class god temples are in this city. If you stay inside Jade Wall City, the members of the God Chaos Party will not try and kill you. They will only want to do something to you. You keep your eyes open from now on, and do not let Master Bao’er get hurt.”

“OK.” Han Sen swiftly agreed. He looked at Rocky Dee and said, “My part is not a problem here. How do you expect to navigate your own affairs?”

“I need you to play a role in an act with me,” Rocky Dee replied. “We need to scare the leader so that he will not send any people to Jade Wall City to deal with you. That is how we can keep Master Bao’er safe.”

“What do I have to do?” Han Sen asked.

“Did you not pick up the Inch Grey Sword from Soldier Knife Sky?” Rocky Dee looked at the bronze sword attached to Han Sen’s waist.

Someone had made Han Sen a scabbard, so the Inch Grey Sword was tied to his waist.

“I want to ask you something. What is this Inch Grey Sword? After I collected this sword, why did Weapon God decide to show up claiming he was there to protect that blade?” Han Sen really wanted to know the origin story behind the sword.

The woman in the sword had looked like Bao’er.

Rocky Dee seriously said, “The Inch Grey Sword is the leader’s sword.”

Han Sen’s heart jumped, prompting him to quickly ask, “Is that the leader in charge now or the leader from the days of yore?”

“Of course, it belonged to the old leader,” Rocky Dee said with a lift of his lips. “That was the real leader. The leader right now is only temporarily holding the position. He is little more than a steward.”

Han Sen was shocked. “This sword is God Chaos Party’s leader’s sword, but that leader almost destroyed the geno hall. It is no wonder the sword’s sword mind was so scary. Why did the woman in the sword look like Bao’er? Is Bao’er the God Chaos Party’s leader reborn?”

Rocky Dee looked at the Inch Grey Sword. “I do not know how you managed to pull that sword out, but I think I am correct in assuming you cannot activate it. Is that right?”

“You are right,” Han Sen said with a nod.

After he had arrived home, he had tried many methods. No matter what he tried, he could not activate the Inch Grey Sword. Still, the sword was indestructible. It was already very strong in his hands.

“Of course, the Inch Grey Sword is the best sword in the universe,” Rocky Dee said. “Even a sky full of God Spirits would be afraid of it. Aside from the Master Leader, no one can use it. No one has what it takes.”

“If it is that strong, how did it randomly end up in Soldier Knife Sky?” Han Sen tried his best to extract information.

“If it wasn’t for the leader...” Rocky Dee only spoke half of what he was about to. He suddenly became alert and stopped. He looked at Han Sen and said, “You do not need to know that. Plus, the sword is in your hands now. We just need to make the temporary leader believe that you can use the Inch Grey Sword. Do that, and I think you will be fine. No matter how brave he is, he will not look for trouble with you.”

“Can you activate the Inch Grey Sword?” Han Sen asked.

Rocky Dee looked at him with disdain. “Of course not. If I was able to, he would have believed what I told him.”

Han Sen understood what Rocky Dee was trying to say. He laughed and asked, “So, how can I act with you in a way to make him believe that I can use the Inch Grey Sword?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Rocky Dee hesitated. He looked at Bao’er and immediately looked back at Han Sen. “I have a way to make him believe the story, but you must do one thing.” “What?” Han Sen asked.

Rocky Dee’s paper-looking body jumped onto Han Sen’s shoulder. He went next to his ear and whispered, “Do not let Master Bao’er use the Inch Grey Sword or there will be a disaster the likes of which you could never imagine.”

“Why?” Han Sen looked weird. He thought the leader of the God Chaos Party was related to Bao’er.

“Just do as I say.” Rocky Dee did not answer Han Sen’s questions, but he gave a final reminder. “By the way, do not leave Jade Wall City anytime soon. If you do, my plan is likely to fail. I can’t lie to the leader.”

After saying that, the paper man looked as if he had lost his soul. It fell from Han Sen’s shoulder.

Han Sen picked up the paper and put it back in the book. Bao’er took it and frowned.

Based on Rocky Dee’s behavior, Bao’er was probably the reborn God Chaos Party leader. If things were like that, Bao’er could activate the Inch Grey Sword. He would not even have to act. He could just let Bao’er use it.

Rocky Dee had said that Bao’er should not be allowed to touch the Inch Grey Sword. That was rather weird. Bao’er also didn’t seem interested in the Inch Grey Sword. If that was her sword from a past life, she would have remembered it.

Han Sen kept thinking it over, thinking it was all so bizarre. He could not figure out anything. So, he had to comply with what Rocky Dee had told him to do. It wasn’t a big deal. He was not planning on leaving Jade Wall City anyway. There was still a month to go before the Qin Kingdom’s annual sacrifice ceremony. He had to go to the Qin Kingdom’s alpha temple and see the new well.

After Rocky Dee spoke to Han Sen, he disappeared. The next few days were quiet. Nothing happened.

Han Sen did not know why Rocky Dee was lying to the temporary leader. As long as nothing went awry, there was an 80% to 90% chance the plan would be a success.

God Chaos Party was in shock. The leader of the God Chaos Party was also in shock. “Can Han Sen use the Inch Grey Sword?”

Rocky Dee was wearing black clothing. He was covered in blood. His left arm was gone. He looked pale as he said, “Yes, Master. My arm was cut off by the Inch Grey Sword. If it was not for the Inch Grey Sword’s help, how could a human break Weapon God Temple?”

“Inch Grey Sword is being used by a human,” God Chaos Party Leader said as he observed Rocky Dee’s wounds. “Let’s not kill Han Sen yet. Let’s figure this out first.”

This time, no one objected because the words on the Inch Grey Sword broke their courage.
