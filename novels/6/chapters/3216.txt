Chapter 3217 The Third Sky

The third sky was quite different from the other two skies. If Han Sen did not know that it was just one of 33 different skies, he would have believed it was a perfectly normal human world.

The third sky had cities, which had all the amenities a city typically possessed. There were streets for vehicles, as well as docks of all shapes and sizes. Most importantly, there were people. There were vast droves of people there. They all exhibited a range of emotions. Many of them were sad, and many of them were happy. Many were at different points of the spectrum in between. It did not matter how one viewed it, but this was indeed a city. By all accounts, it was a bona fide human city.

Space trains were going by in the sky. There were aircraft too. Han Sen saw a group of students crossing a road. “The third sky is quite surprising.” Han Sen was surprised. He thought the 33 skies were all places only monsters could live in.

If there were humans there, they had to be strong. They were fallen humans, so the God Chaos Party had brought them there.

The third sky was different from what Han Sen was thinking. The people there were just civilians. They did not have strong God Spirit Blood-Pulses or gene race powers. “This place seems rather peaceful,” Han Sen thought. It was a thought that made him frown. If they had all been monsters, he would have been happier.

They were just normal people. If Wan’er’s power affected them, Han Sen would have felt bad about it.

Han Sen had only just entered the third sky when he saw that Wan’er was already there. Her hands flashed with gold light. Han Sen’s body reacted faster than his mind, so he was able to dodge the strike.

The gold fire crashed down on the ground and created a big trench through the city. Roads broke, buildings collapsed, and the machines that looked like cars fell apart.

There were some screams and cries all mixed in together. The weak humans ran everywhere, but most of them were already dead in the dirt. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The humans touched by the gold fire immediately dissolved. Blood was everywhere. Han Sen didn’t see any limbs. The gold fire destroyed every part of everyone it ravaged.

Wan’er striking the land did not seem to have an end. It was unknown how many houses and lives she had destroyed.

Han Sen frowned. There was nothing he could do about it now. He only hoped to draw Wan’er away to keep her from killing any more civilians.

Han Sen teleported away. It was a human city. The distance Han Sen traveled was no farther than the trench Wan’er had created in the metropolitan area.

He was ready to teleport again. Han Sen briefly looked at the deep trench Wan’er had created. There used to be a bridge there, but the other side of the bridge was gone because of her strike.

The other half of the bridge was hanging in the air. Below it was a deep, dark, and mysterious trench.

At this time, there was a five- or six-year-old girl holding onto one of the rebars. She was hanging in the air. It looked like she was going to fall. As she clung for her life, she kept crying out, “Mom! Mom!”

Han Sen looked at the girl and teleported toward her. He picked up the girl without issue.

The girl was picked up by Han Sen, but she looked a bit evil. She felt cocky and said, “I thought it was some kind of powerful character coming, but it was just you. Humans are all the same. Without exception, they all think they are heroes. Mister Leader, watch this. Watch me kill the invader.”

Shadow God looked like a little girl. Han Sen was not prepared, but he was still going to attack. Shadow God suddenly felt Han Sen’s hands apply force. His body was thrown away with the force of a cannon-fired cannonball.

Shadow God had been unable to react. He did not think Han Sen would throw him to Wan’er like a bomb.

By the time he realized this had happened, Wan’er was already in front of him. The gold light was coming for him.

Shadow God exploded with shadows. He manifested many clown shadows. One could not accurately determine which of the clown shadows was his true self.

The shadows, which looked like clones, seemed alive. They were all trying to escape in different directions.

Wan’er’s hand flashed. The gold light cut through the body of a clown. The clown screamed. God blood spilled out of it like rain. “How did you see where I was?” Shadow God looked at his body, which had been cut in half, and screamed. His head then fell to the

ground.

It was not just Shadow God who died. Many elites from God Chaos Party’s headquarters were frozen stiff. Shadow God was one of God Chaos Party’s eight kings, which included Weapon God and Liquid God.

Although he was not a top-class elite, he was a Break World God Spirit gene race. He was like an Annihilation-class main god. After he used the strongest shadow power, he was still destroyed in a single strike. It was something the others found difficult to believe.

“Who was that woman? Why does she have such a scary power? Since when did the humans have an elite like this?” The God Chaos Party and elders could only react in shock.

“I have never heard of there being humans this strong before.”

“Who is she?”

“What kind of power was that? It did not look like a Break World power. How can someone be that strong with Break World power? She just killed Shadow God.”

While everyone rambled about what they were seeing, the God Chaos Party leader looked at Wan’er with great interest. He frowned and said, “I know who she is.’

“Leader, do you know who she is?” Many members of the God Chaos Party turned to look at their leader.

The God Chaos Party leader coldly said, “Issue my command to have all members of the God Chaos Party return here and stop engaging the woman.”

“Leader, who is that woman? Does she have what it takes to make you do that?” Everyone was shocked.

The God Chaos Party leader laughed and said, “You guys should remember that person who came to the Chaos God Hall, right? The young man that sought to make a deal with us.” When the people there heard about the man, they looked glum.

An elder looked green and said, “Are you talking about Qin Xiu, Leader?”

“Yes,” God Chaos Party Leader said with a nod.

“Does that lady have something to do with Qin Xiu?” the elder asked.

The God Chaos Party leader’s eyes looked deep. He looked at Wan’er on the screen and asked, “Did you guys forget? The reason Qin Xiu made a trade with us was that he wanted us to revive his sister Qin Wan’er.”

Everyone’s body froze. They could not believe what they had just heard. An elder screamed, “Impossible! His little sister is dead! She could not be revived! Unless... That is impossible!” The God Chaos Party leader coldly said, “It is not entirely impossible. Right now, we know Qin Xiu succeeded. He was a truly awesome guy. It was a shame Qin Wan’er seemed to have a problem after being revived. Her mind was never correct.” “Leader, if that is Qin Xiu’s little sister, should we capture her?” An elder’s eyes looked bright. He looked at Qin Wan’er on the screen.

“No. That other guy is Han Sen, right? He drew Qin Wan’er to have her destroy us. We will do as he wants to. We will let him come here.” God Chaos Party Leader smiled. It was a weird smile.
