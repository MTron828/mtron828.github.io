Chapter 1611: Investigative Result

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Twelve-Winged Dark Seraphim

The moment Ji Yanran put on the Crystal Shoes, they started to shine. The Crystal Shoes then began to grow. In a flash, they wrapped up Ji Yanran’s body like a magnificent set of crystal armor.

“Honey, are you okay?” Han Sen was shocked, not knowing what was going on.

“I’m okay. These shoes are weird, though. I feel energized, like I could punch a mountain in two.” Ji Yanran moved her body and spoke in a tone of surprise.

Seeing that Ji Yanran could control her body just fine, Han Sen felt some relief. He nervously asked, “Can you take them off?” “I don’t know how to take this off,” Ji Yanran said.

As Han Sen frowned, Ji Yanran’s crystal armor suddenly started to grow smaller. Before long, she was just wearing the Crystal Shoes as she had been. Shortly after, they slipped themselves off her feet

“I think these shoes are pretty good. You might benefit from them following you. They could help you out. After all, they are very powerful,” Ji Yanran said.

“I don’t think they can help, but I would be grateful if they didn’t hurt me.” Han Sen was not as hopeful as Ji Yanran. The shoes were still very bizarre items, and that did not make him feel safe.

Han Sen turned around and walked into the house. The Crystal Shoes followed Han Sen again instead of Ji Yanran.

Han Sen could not shake their pursuit no matter what he did. So, he just went about his tasks while trying to ignore their presence.

Han Sen refined the new Life Geno Essences and obtained an extra sixteen super geno points. That brought his point-total up to fifty.

“With my power, it shouldn’t be difficult to max that out now. I need to level up those geno cores first, though. If they don’t reach super, they won’t be very strong,” Han Sen thought to himself.

Han Sen’s fitness was good enough, and what he needed to do most right then was practice and level up his geno cores. So, Han Sen didn’t go out much for a time. He spent most of his time practicing. He wanted to get his four geno cores up to gemstone class.

Four of his geno cores had reached gold class, but they didn’t reach the top of the leaderboard.

Han Sen was going to wait until they were almost ready to become gemstone geno cores. When they were, he’d level them up. If he didn’t, it’d be too obvious.

And because of his fear of the Crystal Shoes, Han Sen was extra adamant about not going anywhere. He just kept practicing and leveling up his skills quickly.

Over the next few months, Bulwark Umbrella, Crystal Core, Real Blood, and Coin took the first position. Then, they disappeared and caused another surprise across the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.

All the beings tried guessing who might have been the owners of those four geno cores. Try as they might, though, none could guess.

The geno cores reached gemstone class next. All Han Sen would need then was a breakthrough. So, Han Sen decided to max out his super geno points so he could level them up to super geno cores.

But sadly, he couldn’t get rid of the Crystal Shoes. After a long time of being together, nothing had happened with the shoes. And as strange as it was to have them following him around, Han Sen was at least able to pocket the shoes to avoid the prying eyes of others.

But before Han Sen took off, he noticed he had received a message from Ji Ruozhen. He said he had uncovered something in his investigation.

“Do you know where the New Community’s leader is?” Han Sen asked.

After a long period of investigation, the results led to Planet Tariq. If the New Community leader was hiding out at one of the three planets, Planet Tariq was the most likely. Ji Ruozhen provided Han Sen with all the information he was able to.

“Planet Tariq...” Han Sen thought to himself as he perused the information given.

“What are you planning to do? If you need help, I can provide you with some ships the Ji family owns,” Ji Ruozhen said.

“There is no need.” Han Sen didn’t plan on bringing in any battleships for an assault, as his beetle would be more than enough.

Even if the leader wasn’t on the planet, Han Sen still had to go and see if he could confirm the information. If he didn’t, the people of the New Community would assume he was weak.

Inside a room, Qing Ya was playing with a little box. The box had been opened, and the item it contained was in front of him. He gazed at it in profound interest. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“That is the item. That means he is the leader of the New Community.” Qing Ya was talking to himself as he played with the box.

“Mister Qing Ya, the leader has asked you to visit the meeting room.” A woman’s voice contacted him through the communicator.

“Okay, I’ll be right there.” Qing Ya put the little box away, pushed the door open, and went to the meeting room as instructed.

Many people were already sitting there when he arrived. There were many humans and shura there, and even Tina was present. The leader himself wasn’t.

“Where is the leader?” Qing Ya asked the others as he went to sit down.

A shura man approached and sat down on the leader’s seat He said icily, “The leader is sick, so I will be hosting this meet.” “Are you qualified?” Qing Ya laughed.

“What do you think?” The shura placed his hands on the table. He was holding a metallic object, and when they all saw what it was, their faces changed.

“Okay, if that is what the leader has declared, then we will listen.” Qing Ya shrugged.

“Good.” The shura man gave Qing Ya a silent stare, and then went on to say, “The leader is not happy with your performance. You have failed twice, and twice embarrassed us.”

“What could I do? Who knew Blood Bone Witch and Fallen Slaughter were that stupid?” Qing Ya rebutted.

“There are no excuses for your failure. I will be in charge of this operation now. You just need to send our forces to Shadow Shelter,” the shura man said.

“Okay. But who exactly are we sending?” Qing Ya asked.

“Me, and our grateful shura fighters.” The shura man spoke calmly, but it was easy to discern the arrogance permeating his tone of voice.

“All of them?” Qing Ya looked at him strangely.

“Yes, all of them. No failure is permitted this time. We have to kill Han Sen.” The shura man then looked at Qing Ya and asked, “Do you have a problem with this?”

“No. I know full-well your abilities. This is fine,” Qing Ya said.

“Good. Do your appointed task and we’ll do the rest. Do that and we won’t fail.” The shura man sounded very confident.
