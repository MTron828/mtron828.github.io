Chapter 2133 The Battle Under Pressure

Seeing Evil Eye covered in purple fire, Han Sen frowned. When a Sky opened their Sky eye, their general strength would leap by about one whole tier. Evil Eye’s power was already above what could be expected of a Marquise, but now with the Sky eye had opened, his power was comparable to the strongest of Dukes.

It was quite difficult to fathom how a Marquise could possess such grand strength.

Bzzt!

The audience did not see Evil Eye move. All they heard was a sound, and Evil Eye’s body started to appear faded. Before his body had completely vanished from that location, he appeared directly in front of Han Sen.

He had moved far more quickly than should have been possible for any Marquise. It was way too fast for anyone to properly track.

Han Sen moved when Evil Eye did, though. He swung his fist, and when Evil Eye appeared in front of him, Han Sen’s fist collided with the power his nemesis had prepared to unleash.

Han Sen’s fist hit the purple lotus flower, reducing it to nothing but dust.

Han Sen’s gauntlet shattered, and blood leaked from his skin.

Evil Eye frowned, all the same. He was surprised that Han Sen had been able to shatter his power, even with the strength he now held.

Evil Eye’s power far exceeded what Han Sen was capable of right now, but Super Spank only had to collide with one small spot to set off a chain-reaction that would wipe out a sequence structure. The collapse would build in strength as it went.

Unless Han Sen’s power was insufficient to exploit a specific structure’s weaknesses, there was no proper reason for Super Spank to fail to break anything.

For now, at least, Han Sen was able to break the sequence structures. And that meant Evil Eye wasn’t quite an overwhelming threat just yet.

What threatened Han Sen the most, though, was Evil Eye’s speed after opening his Sky eye. Not even he was able to follow Evil Eye’s movement. He had to use his Dongxuan Sutra to predict where Evil Eye would appear and Heavenly Go’s formation to counter his attacks.

If he waited for Evil Eye to make a move before reacting, it’d be too late for Han Sen to block his strikes. Evil Eye appeared erratically, like a ghost that was coming at Han Sen from every which way. The purple flowers kept flashing near him.

Every time Han Sen punched, a purple flower would vanish. But while many flowers were wilting, the elites that spectated the fight were having a difficult time grasping what exactly was going on.

Many people had noticed that Evil Eye was moving more quickly than should have been possible, of course. But aside from that, they couldn’t really tell what was special about the fight between Dollar and Evil Eye.

“Father, is there a point in them fighting this fast?” Yun Suyi, who was lost in confusion, felt compelled to ask Yun Changkong.

Yun Changkong sighed and said, “If Lone Bamboo had shown up for his fight, he might not have been able to beat Dollar, either.”

The Yun sisters and the others were all shocked. Lone Bamboo was like a god to them.

Not looking away from the fight, Yun Changkong said, “His speed and power are definitely not up to the standard set by Evil Eye, but he is still holding his own. It’s not as if he’s being crushed. This fact alone makes him most excellent.”

“His speed and power are inferior to Evil Eye’s? I couldn’t tell. I assumed they were both even,” Yun Suyi said in confusion.

“That’s what it looks like on the surface, but yes, Dollar is unable to match his opponent’s speed. Even worse, he has less power than his rival, as well,” Yun Changkong said.

“Why does it look like they are even, then?” Yun Suyi asked.

“That is what makes Dollar so impressive.” Yun Changkong paused for a moment. “Although you guys can’t see this because of the speed of the fight, Dollar is moving before Evil Eye strikes. He’s practically clairvoyant. It looks like he knows what Evil Eye will do before he even makes a move. He attacks where Evil Eye is going to be, rather than where he is. That is how this fight remains balanced.”

The Yun sisters and the others turned their attention back to the fight, trying to make sense of it. Thousand Feather Crane, as flabbergasted as the rest, had to ask, “Isn’t that what you find in the Textless Book? Is Dollar one of the Sky that has practiced Textless Book?”

“No, he is not using Textless Book. While I can see some similarities, they are not the same.” Yun Changkong shook his head.

“Even though he is able to predict Evil Eye’s movements, how is he able to keep things in balance if his power is still inferior?” Yun Sushang did not understand this bit.

“I’ll admit, I don’t understand that either. Dollar must have a very powerful skill to fight someone much stronger than him, though,” Yun Changkong said.

Every race was doing their best to analyze the fight taking place between Dollar and Evil Eye. They had all wanted to research Coin, but Dollar’s entire performance was a far better subject for study than they had initially thought possible.

And the deified members of the audience were most fascinated by the fight.

A pure physical fight was nothing to such spectators, but using such refined techniques over an extended conflict? That was something that deified elites very much wanted to see.

The four pupils in Evil Eye’s Sky eye were bright, and his speed and power continued to increase. Han Sen was having a hard time keeping up with the fight.

Super Spank was strong, and so was the Dongxuan Sutra and Heavenly Go. But when the opponent gained too much strength, their effectiveness was reduced.

Han Sen maintained his calm, however, despite the wounds that his fists were collecting. The injuries were so profuse that his blood-soaked bones were becoming visible through his tom flesh. They were the damage he had to suffer to keep breaking the sequence structures of his enemy.

It was like pulling fishing strings. It was impossible to keep something that fine and tough from hurting you.

But Han Sen’s will was unwavering. Without a moment of pause, his excitement remained steady.

Han Sen cast the Dongxuan Sutra and destroyed the next sequence structure. He was able to predict Evil Eye’s attacks, and the whole world through Han Sen’s eyes was turning into a series of threads he could follow.

Under the increasing threat from Evil Eye, Han Sen running the Dongxuan Sutra in overdrive. And this pressure was going to result in his Dongxuan Sutra reaching Marquise.

When the Dongxuan Aura changed, time itself became visible.

For the first time in his life, Han Sen could see time, not just feel it.

Earlier, Han Sen could see movement. Now, he was seeing actual timelines.

In normal people’s eyes, one person walking was just one person. In Han Sen’s eyes, while that one person walked, the image of that person spread out like shadows all around them.

Time. A second before. Two seconds before. Three seconds before. The timeline spread in three dimensions, allowing Han Sen to see options he had never previously considered.

When the Dongxuan powers changed, the feelings became stronger, too. And the timelines he could see extended in all directions. He gasped, seeing more than he ever thought possible.
