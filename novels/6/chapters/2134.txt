Chapter 2135 Breaking Out of the Cocoon to Become a Butterfly

“Lone Bamboo!” The Sky Palace leader’s face suddenly went ashen.

And it wasn’t only the Sky Palace leader feeling this way. Everyone watching the fight was in shock. Behind the veil of that white and purple armor, the combatant was revealed to be none other than Lone Bamboo of Sky Palace.

One person was not allowed to enter the Geno Being Scroll under two different identities. Lone Bamboo had already been seen competing, so he could not have been Evil Eye in disguise.

After a moment or two elapsed, the realization of what had actually occurred began to settle in.

Sky Palace’s leader had the quickest reaction of them all. He slammed the table in front of him, with a force that reduced it to dust. His voice filled with rage, he exclaimed, “Evil Eye! I do not care what you are; for this transgression, I will make you suffer!”

Very few things could make the Sky Palace leader behave like that, but Lone Bamboo was one of them.

Han Sen now knew why looking at Evil Eye had filled him with a disconcerting sense of familiarity. It was because his opponent, in some capacity, was Lone Bamboo.

No, it was just Lone Bamboo’s body.

“No wonder Lone Bamboo did not show up to fight.” Han Sen stared at Evil Eye, who was wearing the guise of someone so familiar.

Evil Eye stared at Han Sen, his eyes radiating evil. A cruel purple flame began to blaze out of him.

“Good... Very good. You have pushed me this far... You are the only one to have done this in over a million years!” Evil Eye’s voice hissed through a gap in his clenched jaw. The way he spoke made the audience shiver.

It had been a million years since Evil Eye had felt the possibility of death. If he hadn’t used a forbidden power to evade that last strike, he would have been turned into dust along with his armor under the force of Super Spank.

But he used the forbidden power, and that meant he had entered a mode that was rather passive.

In Evil Eye’s Sky eye, the flower-looking pupils started to wilt. Something was seeping out, swimming around the eye as it came. Because of that change, his body began to leak purple smoke.

“Someone was bound to put you in your place eventually. It’s going to happen a second and third time, too. Just settle down and get used to it,” Han Sen said, his voice grim.

Earlier, he felt ashamed that he hadn’t managed to kill Evil Eye. Right now, he was very glad that he hadn’t. If his strike had been successful, Lone Bamboo’s body would have been destroyed.

Han Sen didn’t know exactly what was going on, but he had the feeling that the body really did belong to Lone Bamboo.

You are right. It was bound to happen once, but you and I are different. You won’t have a chance at a second or third time, because you can only die once,” Evil Eye said. And then, all four of his purple eyes shattered.

Four powers beamed out of his eyes, which then turned into purple crystals. They were like shiny purple gems.

A number of purple markings scrawled their way across Evil Eye’s body, and then flames shot out of them. The purple flowers across him also started to become real, turning from bone into real plants. The petals spread across his body, linking together to form a new set of armor.

Evil Eye roared to the skies above. The purple lights then drew together to create two purple butterfly wings. The wings each had the symbol of an eye on them, and they glowed purple. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

When the flower armor and the butterfly wings appeared, Evil Eye’s powers started to increase in volume. It was truly difficult to fathom just how strong he was becoming.

“Purple Eye Butterfly!” Many of the old people that were watching this fight couldn’t help but balk at the name.

“Evil Eye is actually Purple Eye Butterfly? He’s that *sshole?” In the dark land of Sacred, Old Eagle looked at Evil Eye and clenched his jaws.

“He’s not dead?” Auntie Mei frowned profusely.

In Sky Palace, the masked woman also found herself screaming. “One of the ten generals of Sacred? Purple Eye Butterfly! He is Evil Eye? Now it finally makes sense that he has been reborn countless times through the ages.”

The Sky Palace leader was still angry, and he snarled, “Even if he’s Sacred’s leader reborn, he laid his grubby mitts on my student! For that crime, I will kill him myself.”

On Buddha Planet, Burning Lamp Alpha found himself in a state of shock, too. “Sacred’s general Purple Eye Butterfly is not dead? This is interesting.”

“Purple Eye Butterfly settled into a cocoon, only to become a butterfly. It is because of this he is practically immortal. But every time he is reborn, he can never finish the last step. Each and every time, he can go no further than becoming deified.” In a black hole, Demon Alpha laughed coldly to himself. He looked at the person with disdain.

All the elites of the universe looked at the Evil Eye’s true form in a number of different ways. They all thought different things about him.

Evil Eye’s body kept changing. He looked at his enemy, Han Sen, and said angrily, “I wanted to find a stronger body before becoming a butterfly. I wanted it to combine with the host, but because of you, I have to waste my butterfly form on this petty vessel. And what’s more, I cannot find myself another host now. That’s fine, though, I suppose. I guess this body is enough, once I combine and properly assimilate with it. With that combination of power, I should be able to kill you.”

As Evil Eye was talking, the purple symbols that decorated his butterfly wings became extremely bright. A strange, voluminous swirl started to appear.

A light was dousing the entire area in a number of its beams. That light seemed impossible to avoid, but Han Sen gathered up a bunch of power to try to repel its assault anyway. But nothing he did worked, for he felt the light penetrate his body.

Han Sen felt as if he had been chained up. He no longer had any control, and he could not even close his eyelids.

Han Sen had always been surprised that his body was no weaker than an Evilbreaker Dragon body, but seal powers did not work on him. Despite that, the light that came from those eye patterns were enough to shoot through his defenses and seal him. That light was too strong to appropriately describe.

Han Sen wished to use his own power to escape the speed of that light, but doing so was useless. He could not break Evil Eye’s eyelights, either.

“Purple Eyelight isn’t an ordinary sealing technique. Even if a deified elite was snared by it, nothing they could do would allow them to break free. Dollar is just a Marquise, and now he cannot even hope to tear up his own paper to escape. Purple Eye Butterfly can do anything he wishes now.” The Sky Palace leader looked grim. He stared at Purple Eye Butterfly, thinking of ways in which he might be able to kill Purple Eye Butterfly for good.

Evil Eye coldly looked at Han Sen and flapped his purple wings. He flew over to Han Sen, gritted his teeth, and said, “I will make you regret ever having come into existence.”

Evil Eye flew directly before him, and Han Sen still couldn’t break out of the force that bound him. He sighed and thought to himself, “It looks like my only option is to use super god spirit body to get out of this, but even if I do that, I can’t think of a way in which I might save Lone Bamboo. It’s not like I can kill him.”

But right then, Han Sen had no choice. Just as he was about to use his super god spirit mode, he suddenly saw Evil Eye stop in front of him. The purple crystal eye on his forehead began to bleed.
