2075 Get Pregnant with Just a Rub?

Ice crystals kept spreading across the Blood Feather Knife, and it looked as if everything within the vacuumed container was going to freeze. The ice crystals grew, branching out like blood vessels. It was scary to watch.

“Yu Shanxin must be half-deified. If he wasn’t, there’s no way he could freeze the vacuum.” Han Sen was surprised.

Everyone watched as the ice powers spread through the container, freezing even the empty space within it. In the end, it was all frozen. It looked like a perfect crystal ball. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The Absolute Container was shining, and something seemed to be moving within the ice. Something was fighting against the cold powers.

The researchers were fortunate that the Absolute Container was deified. Despite their strength, the cold powers weren’t leaking out of the container.

Yu Shanxin pulled his hand out of the container. He looked as ordinary as ever, and his hand showed no sign of the incredible cold that he had just released.

“My work is done here. Let’s go, Old Wang,” Yu Shanxin said, then pulled the dog Old Wang away. When he passed by Han Sen, Yu Shanxin said quietly, “Why are you still standing here? Don’t interrupt their research.”

Han Sen cocked his head, then followed Yu Shanxin to leave.

The researchers inside Sky Path Garden got back to work. Some of them saw Han Sen leave with Yu Shanxin, but no one thought to stop him.

“Mister Yu, do you have a grudge with the head researcher?” Han Sen asked curiously.

“Call me Yu Shanxin.” Yu Shanxin carried Old Wang as they walked, and he went on to say, “There is no grudge. I just don’t like the way they do things.”

“How do they do things?” Han Sen asked again.

“Do you know what Child Combine Liquid is made of?” Yu Shanxin looked at the vial in Han Sen’s hand as he asked.

“No, I don’t know. This is the first time I’ve heard of this item, actually,” Han Sen said.

“Child Combine Liquid uses thousands of unborn xenogeneic babies as an ingredient. There are intelligent creatures in there, like you and me.” Yu Shanxin looked at Han Sen and smiled.

Han Sen raised the Child Combine Liquid to the light so he could take a look at it. He was surprised to hear this, and so he said, “Where do these ingredients come from?”

“They come from the creatures that the members of Sky Path Garden capture. They do tests on them. What do you think?” Yu Shanxin asked. He noticed Han Sen was not having much of a reaction，which interested him.

“I am a sinner with hands stained in blood. I cannot judge them.” Han Sen shook his head.

Yu Shanxin laughed. He patted Han Sen on the shoulder and said, “This is why I hate those people, but they are the ones that make Sky Palace as strong as it is. I just don’t like it. Still, it doesn’t matter. I’m a useless nobody here, and that’s just that.”

Yu Shanxin left after that, still carrying Old Wang. He disappeared amongst the islands somewhere.

“Why did he tell me that?” Han Sen looked at the Child Combine Liquid and sighed. He was not very noble himself, as he had killed so many. But after Yu Shanxin spoke about the ingredients inside the vial, he didn’t think he could bring himself to drink it.

“Never mind; I’ll just give it to the others.” Han Sen put away the Child Combine Liquid and went to the general service area.

Han Sen researched the rules of Sky Palace. If he wanted to bring Bao’er here, legally, he’d need to go to the general service. Han Sen asked the people there how he might bring another person into Sky Palace, and it turned out to be an easier process than Han Sen had expected.

Han Sen’s rank of Teacher was useful in many different ways in Sky Palace. With that title, he could invite his family to come and live with him. Without that title, no parent or spouse could ever visit him here.

But annoyingly, if he said Bao’er was his daughter, then they’d need to do a DNA test. Han Sen didn’t know exactly how the test would be conducted, but there was no way the results would tell them that Bao’er was indeed his actual daughter.

But according to the laws of Sky Palace, aside from parents and grandparents, only wives and kids were allowed to reside with a Teacher.

“It looks like I still can’t bring Bao’er into Sky Palace.” Han Sen felt depressed.

The only other way was for Han Sen to make additional contributions to Sky Palace and gain the approval of at least half of the elders. Han Sen could also ask for the leader’s approval, but attempting that seemed unrealistic.

His discoveries had made him curious about Bao’er’s DNA, though. He had Bubble take on his appearance and go to sleep on Jade Island. Then, he went back to the Alliance and visited Bao’er. He took one of her hairs and went for a DNA test, wanting to see if her genes looked like any creature in particular.

The DNA tests in the Alliance were rather advanced, but Bao’er herself had come out of a gourd. None knew what her genes were like.

Han Sen almost bought the entire planet and made the testing place a temporary home. He walked in front of the gene tester and put Bao’er’s hair inside so he could conduct the test.

Not long after, the test results were released. The results were printed upon a sheet of paper, and what he saw made his eyes widen.

The DNA test printout read, “Father and Daughter.”

“D*mn, what a broken machine! And I just bought this thing... Who made this piece of sh*t? Ah, I see. It is Starry Group! I’ll complain to Ning Yue later.” Han Sen did not believe the results, so he did the same test on another DNA tester. The results almost made his eyes fall out. All the tests were the same, telling him that he and Bao’er were father and daughter.

“This is impossible.” Han Sen swore he had never cheated with a gourd before. How could the results indicate that he and Bao’er were genetically related?

Han Sen looked at the report carefully. Bao’er’s genes had a 99.99% match with his. Aside from them actually being father and daughter, there was no other explanation.

“How is this possible?” Han Sen looked at Bao’er, who was looking innocent and unsure of what to say.

You can get pregnant with just a rub?” Han Sen remembered that after he picked up the gourd, he used to fiddle with it while he thought. Aside from that, though, he couldn’t think of any way they could have formed this connection.

But now, Han Sen had to admit that Bao’er was his actual daughter.

Han Sen quickly destroyed all the test results. He took Bao’er by the shoulders and smiled. “Bao’er, let’s not tell mom that we came here for testing.”
