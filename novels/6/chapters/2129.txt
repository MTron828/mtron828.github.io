Chapter 2130 Dismantling Coin

The surface of the bronze scroll flashed, showing two fighters who appeared amidst the dunes of a desert. One was clad in a suit of gold armor, whereas the other was garbed in white and purple armor. Their body shapes were remarkably similar.

This is it, it’s going to start!” Everyone felt a great deal of relief in their hearts. After what happened with the no-show Lone Bamboo, many Nobles feared the same issue might plague the anticipated finale.

Evil Eye looked at Han Sen with a great deal of interest, and he asked, “What race do you actually belong to?”

“Human,” Han Sen answered calmly. He peered right back at Evil Eye.

That man was shrouded by darkness as deep as the abyss itself, but somehow, Han Sen was struck with a strange pang of familiarity as he looked at the man.

And when he looked closer, the sensation grew even stronger. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You really are a human? That is a good name, I suppose.” Evil Eye mumbled something to himself beneath his breath. Han Sen heard what he said, but he wasn’t quite sure what he meant by that.

Evil Eye wasn’t planning on explaining it, either. He looked back at Han Sen, smiled, and said, “Your Coin is pretty funny. Would you mind if I had a look at it?”

“As you wish.” Han Sen lifted his right hand and put two of his fingers together. Then, he flicked in the direction of Evil Eye.

A coin appeared, and it teleported towards Evil Eye with the speed of lightning.

Evil Eye made no effort to dodge the incoming coin or knock it away with a godlight. Instead, he caught the incoming coin with the palm of his right hand.

Pat!

The coin stuck to Evil Eye’s hand. His body began to sink, his feet lowering into the sand a little.

“What a powerful Coin! It not only has the ability to suppress a foe, but it can seal. This could very well become a deified class geno art. I cannot believe a geno art like this has been around, unknown to me over the centuries of my existence.” Evil Eye brought his hand closer to get a better look at the coin. He looked genuinely interested in the item.

Evil Eye knew that Coin’s suppression and sealing powers were strong, as did everyone else. But he had to let the coin land on him so that he could research it properly.

If anyone else had done something like this, they would have seemed incredibly reckless. But to the people watching the bout, it seemed the most natural thing in the world for Evil Eye to do.

“What a weird geno art. It is heavy... It forbids air... It suppresses... and some weird power...” Evil Eye mumbled to himself. Then he placed another of his fingers on the coin. He tightened his grip, and the coin was crushed within his fist.

The viewers looked on in shock. The Coin that was believed to be indestructible, that had suppressed and defeated Dragon Eight, had been shattered by Evil Eye. It appeared not to work on him at all.

“Evil Eye really is untouchable! Coin doesn’t even work on him.”

This really is too frightening to watch. He has lived for so long, too; this man is a god!”

“Coin is useless, after all? With that out of the way, it appears to me that Dollar has lost all chance of winning this fight.”

“It looks like there is nothing more to see. That strongest skill known as Coin was broken by Evil Eye’s hands. How can anyone expect this supposed fight to continue?”

“Evil Eye really is too scary.”

Amidst everyone’s shock at Evil Eye’s lackadaisical breaking of the coin, Evil Eye suddenly moved. He did not move to attack Han Sen, though. He threw the pieces of the coin into the air and made them hover before him.

Evil Eye then wiggled his fingers. The pieces were covered in a purple light, then they began to break down into smaller and smaller chunks.

Bathed in the glow of that purple light, the coin was ground into gold dust. The gold motes floated in front of Evil Eye.

“Your Coin is not perfect... I was one of the Dragon, at one point, and in my time with them, I was able to learn their Dragon Seal. I was one of the Empty, as well. With them, I learned Vacuum. And at another place in time, I belonged to the Destroyed. It was with them that I learned how to perform Taboo. That’s not forgetting my time as a Buddha...” Evil Eye appeared to be talking to himself, as he moved his fingers. The gold dust gathered around those fingers, though, recomposing the original shape.

A new coin had been created, but this one was slightly different from the one Han Sen had produced. In addition to the coin and the number count, there were purple engravings on it. They were reminiscent of flowers.

Evil Eye held up that new coin he had produced. It was like a work of art. He smiled at it.

“Dollar? What do you think of this, eh?” Evil Eye said, right before flicking his finger. He propelled the modified coin straight towards Han Sen with the speed of a laser beam.

All the audience was in shock. To dismantle an enemy’s geno art and then go on to modify it in the middle of a fight was something only a god could do. There was, of course, the possibility that Evil Eye wasn’t even treating this fight as actual combat. He might have just been curious about Coin.

“Sick! A guy like Evil Eye should be forbidden from even joining the Geno Being Scroll. Other races can’t do anything remotely comparable to this!”

“How could something like this even happen? There should be rules, and this should be against them.”

“F*ck! Before Evil Eye, no geno art can remain shrouded in secrecy. That guy has been reborn as so many races over the years, so there’s no telling just how many geno arts he has actually learned.”

“He is a god.”

While everyone was reeling from the shock of this, Han Sen reacted much like Evil Eye had. He made no move to block or deflect the coin. All he did was use his right hand to grab it.

Boom!

When Han Sen grabbed the coin, the sand in a radius of one-kilometer shook. That area sank half a meter.

Evil Eye smiled at Han Sen. “This may very well be your Coin, but you shouldn’t think about grabbing it so merrily. It’s mine now.”

“Dollar is too emotional. He shouldn’t have tried to take it back.”

“Oh, no! Dollar is being suppressed by Coin! Does all the excitement we anticipated come to an end here?”

“It looks like the suppression power of Coin has been amplified to a sickening level, after Evil Eye’s modifications.”

“It is way too strong. There is no hope of victory against that!”

Everyone was in shock. Even Sky Path Garden’s leader looked bitter, and he said, “We cannot see anything like this! Guys like Evil Eye shouldn’t ever be seen in a Marquise battleground.”

Evil Eye continued smiling at Han Sen. The expression had grown a little rigid, but he kept it in place. Evil Eye wasn’t the only one who was surprised, though. The audience watched as Dollar used his other hand to crush the coin that had been manufactured, modified, and fired by Evil Eye.

“Interesting modification, but it is too stiff to combine the powers you proposed. While it may indeed look stronger, it lacks the meaning and feel of the original,” Han Sen said coolly, while he squeezed the coin.

“Oh, so you don’t think it is any good? Then show me how I can avoid making it stiff.” Evil Eye’s eyebrow was raised.

Han Sen didn’t respond, though. He threw his coin into the air while everyone was watching, and then he moved his finger to imbue it with a golden light.
