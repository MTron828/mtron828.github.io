“Where is he? I’ll seize him now,” said Qing Ya, surprised.

“No need,” said the Chairman of the New Community. All of a sudden, the force of his body surged, and the space in the meeting room became tight and claustrophobic.

“What are you doing, Mr. Chairman?” Qing Ya was horrified. He couldn’t move his body anymore, as if he was frozen by a spell.

“Do you really think I don’t know who you are, Qing Ya?” The Chairman walked toward Qing Ya. He reached out his hand, and a box flew out of Qing Ya’s pocket

“Mr. Chairman, I was wrong to keep that. I was a bit greedy. Besides, Fallen Slaughter had already died, so that’s why I didn’t give you back the box. I’m really sorry,” said Qing Ya.

The Chairman didn’t pay any attention to Qing Ya. He opened the box and took a look, then he put the box on the desk. He looked at Qing Ya and said, “Since you’ve seen what’s inside the box, then you should’ve guessed who I am now.”

“I don’t know,” said Qing Ya with his head lowered.

The Chairman looked at Qing Ya and said, “You know, but you don’t know.”

“I don’t understand what you’re talking about.” Qing Ya shook his head.

“As a member of God, you should know that I’m a member of Blood Legion after seeing this, but aside from being a member of Blood Legion, I have another identity,” said the Chairman mildly.

“What’s your other identity?” Qing Ya raised his head and stared at the Chairman of the New Community. When the Chairman identified Qing Ya as a member of God, the respect and veneration on Qing Ya’s face slipped away like a mask. He no longer looked like a subordinate.

“My real name is Han Yufei,” said the Chairman calmly.

Qing Ya was petrified when he heard the name. “Han Yufei? Han Sen’s father?”

“Now that you know my name, you know why you have to die,” said the Chairman. Then he lifted his hand toward Qing Ya’s head.

Qing Ya suddenly smiled and said, “Chairman, since you know that I’m a member of God, do you really think that you can kill me?”

“Why not?” The president was still calm and peaceful, and he gradually pressed his hand against Qing Ya’s head.

“Since you know about the existence of God, you should know that the genes we have are different from the genes you inferiors have. Your power is indeed impressive, but that’s far from enough to kill me,” said Qing Ya calmly. A strange power began to ripple from his body.

However, Qing Ya quickly looked surprised. After he used all his power, he still wasn’t able to get rid of the bindings around him.

“Impossible... How is it possible... Are you also...” Qing Ya stared at the Chairman of the New Community in horror.

“You came here for this thing, right? Have you forgotten about it already?” The Chairman said quietly. His palm was already pressed against Qing Ya’s head.

“Impossible. If you’re a member of Blood Legion, there’s no way you’re an existence like us... Did you show us those things on purpose?” Qing Ya looked very pale already.

“You’ve overestimated yourself. You called yourselves Gods, but you’re nowhere near that. Humans have the same potential as you do, it’s just that few have reached that far yet,” said the Chairman as he tightened his fingers.

“If you kill me, God won’t let you get away... Peng...” Before Qing Ya could finish talking, his head imploded.

“God? I’m not very impressed by your power.” The Chairman flicked his hands to shake off the blood. Then he turned away from Qing Ya’s body.

Han Sen had been absorbing the Life Geno Essences, and he had gained more and more super geno points. He was very close to maxing out now.

When he arrived home, he prepared to take Littleflower to the garden to relax after dinner, yet his communicator suddenly rang.

Han Sen picked up the call, and he found that it was Blind Man.

“Do you have time?” said Blind Man directly. He wasn’t wasting anytime.

“What do you want?” Han Sen was very direct as well. He didn’t know anything about Blind Man, so there was no reason for pleasantries.

“You father wants to meet you. Come to this place if you have time.” Blind Man sent Han Sen an address.

Han Sen missed a heartbeat He had always wanted to meet his father to see whether he was still alive or not, but now that the day had finally come, he was anxious.

“Can I come now?” asked Han Sen, looking at Blind Man. His heart was pounding quickly.

“Okay, but don’t let anyone follow you,” said Blind Man.

“Okay, I understand. I’m going now.” Right after Han Sen finished talking, Blind Man shut down the communicator.

Han Sen cleared his thoughts for a while, as he couldn’t even think straight after receiving such a piece of news.

“I have to go whether it’s true or not.” After making up his mind, he packed his things, sent Littleflower to Ji Yanran, and then went out by himself.

He set off to the address given by Blind Man, and he didn’t even take Bao’er this time.

“If it’s really him, is he still the same as before? What should I ask him?” Countless thoughts flooded Han Sen’s mind, but they were all irrelevant

Han Sen could only calm himself after getting into the spaceship.

He arrived at his destination, which was a famous tourist planet Han Sen could still remember that his father had taken him here when he was a kid.

However, it had been a very long time ago, and Han Sen was very young back then. His memories of this place were blurry, and he couldn’t remember much of the scenery or what he had done here as a child.

Han Sen walked on the planet that looked like a garden, but he wasn’t in the mood to appreciate his surroundings. He followed the route on his GPS, and he walked all the way to the designated location.

In front of a lake that looked like a piece of jade, Han Sen saw a man sitting on a stone bench. The sunset light fell across the man’s body, and he had a long shadow.

When he saw the shadow, Han Sen missed a heartbeat. The shadow in his head overlapped with the blurry shadow in front of him, and the shadow in his mind was getting clearer and clearer.

“Is that really him?” Han Sen walked toward that man step by step, and he couldn’t keep his legs from shaking. He was more nervous than when he had fought the creature horde in Outer Sky. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The man seemed to have sensed Han Sen coming. He stood up from the stone steps, then he turned around to look at Han Sen.

The second that Han Sen saw the man’s face, Han Sen was horrified. He had received a photo of the Chairman of the New Community while he was researching the organization, and that was the only material he had. As for the person who was standing in front of him, he looked exactly like the person in the photo.
