Chapter 2264 Forced Entry

When the blood kirin saw that Han Sen wasn’t eating anything, it turned around to continue consuming the corpse by itself. It looked as if it wasn’t going to stop until every last morsel of the black kirin had been consumed.

Han Sen had no interest in watching the beast eat, so he decided to leave the cave. He leaped into the blood water and swam back the way he had come. The cave had no other exits, so he had to leave via the same blood pond.

After he crawled out of the pond, Han Sen picked a few blood pears to give to Little Silver. The fox had retrieved the Thunder God Spike for him, but in doing so, it had been injured.

Both the fox and the weapon were of the lightning element, but the Thunder God Spike was clearly far more powerful than Little Silver. If Little Silver’s Lightning Fox Body hadn’t possessed full immunity to lightning, then the little creature might not have been able to pull the Thunder God Spike out.

“Now that I’ve helped the blood kirin, it won’t mind if I take more blood pears and give them to Little Silver, right? I’m sure the blood kirin wouldn’t care,” Han Sen thought to himself as he collected the fruit. He lobbed them into Destiny’s Tower for Little Silver. But when he glanced inside the tower, he found Little Silver curled up to rest. Its tail was wrapped around the Thunder God Spike, and the Thunder God Spike was crackling as silver lightning arced around it. The bolts would occasionally jump to touch Little Silver’s fur, but the fox didn’t seem to mind. It just continued to rest.

Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to get a better look. When the Thunder God Spike’s lightning landed on Little Silver, the small fox was absorbing its power. The lightning blended into Little Silver’s powers, slowly changing them as the fox rested.

Han Sen walked over and gently set one of the blood pears beside Little Silver. Then, he exited the tower and left the lotus mountain.

When he made it down from the lotus mountain, he found Fox Queen standing directly in front of the hellish skeletal gate. She was looking at him.

Fox Queen’s eyebrows rose as Han Sen approached.

Her chains wouldn’t let her move far from the gate. Otherwise, she would have explored the distant mountain range for herself long ago.

“You killed the blood kirin?” Fox Queen asked in a disturbed tone of voice.

Han Sen shook his head. “No. I can’t defeat a foe like that. But I’ve been here for a while, and we’ve gotten to know each other a bit. It hasn’t been hostile to me at all.”

Fox Queen looked at Han Sen with a veiled expression. She thought Han Sen’s explanation had to be utter nonsense.

The blood kirin was a beast of particular savagery, and it had been locked up in White Bone Hell all its life. If it ever escaped the White Bone Hell, few would survive an encounter with it. That thing was a King class demon.

If the blood kirin had grown comfortable with Han Sen simply because he had spent time with it, she wondered why the same had not occurred between the monster and herself. She had spent far more time with it, and she had even watched it grow up. Yet, there wasn’t even a faint semblance of closeness between her and the beast.

“Who are you?” Fox Queen stared at Han Sen. She had found his behavior suspicious for a long time, and it made her wary of him. Perhaps Han Sen really had been taken by General Ghost Bone, and he had just been pretending ever since.

“I told you; I am a member of the Ice Blue Knights.” Han Sen said, a little reproachfully.

Fox Queen started to respond, but all of a sudden, her face changed. “Someone forced open the palace’s door.”

“No way!” Han Sen was shocked. That palace had been built by General Ghost Bone. Not even a deified elite should have been able to open it. And there was no way Edward or the others could have gotten through the entrance.

“They have only breached the first line. They are coming in via the primary entrance. Huh. It seems that they have a death wish.” Fox Queen narrowed her eyes and walked back through the hellish skeletal gate.

Han Sen felt sick. He didn’t think Edward and the others would make it inside, but now they had. Han Sen’s identity would soon be exposed.

Realizing this, Han Sen quickly followed Fox Queen. But he then rushed out of the side hall ahead of her.

Just as Fox Queen had said, there was an opening in the gate of the main hall. Edward and the others were now coming in.

“Han Sen, where are you going to run this time?” shouted a King class Ice Blue Knight. Then, he ran at Han Sen.

“Shut up! This isn’t a place that you can just smash your way into!” Han Sen shouted as he quickly retreated. He fell back to Fox Queen, who had just appeared. Ice Blue Knight King’s power was headed for Fox Queen.

Fox Queen’s face drew into a smile, but her eyes glimmered with the fire of murder. She didn’t even have to move her hand as a cord of power shot out of her and wrapped around the Ice Blue Knight.

“Careful!” Ice Blue Knight King shouted. He moved to help the King class Ice Blue Knight, but it was too late.

The cord of power tightened, and the Ice Blue Knight’s body was torn apart. It was horrifying to watch. The warrior was murdered before he even had a chance to defend himself.

Han Sen’s scalp felt numb. A King class elite had been oh-so-easily killed. The demonstration of Fox Queen’s power confirmed Han Sen’s belief that she was deified. It was fortunate she had wanted to keep Han Sen with her instead of killing him. Han Sen would have been very dead if things had turned out differently.

The faces of the other intruders turned white. They turned to leave the palace, but the opening they created to enter had already disappeared. And that was because of Fox Queen.

Edward and the others attacked the palace’s gate, but their efforts were futile.

“Didn’t you know? You can’t just come and go from this palace as you please.” Fox Queen’s cords of power began to move again, heading for Edward and all the others.

Edward, Ice Blue Knight King, and Crime managed to block the attacks, but the other King class elites were all captured.

“Deified powers are scary!” Han Sen’s scalp felt numb. It seemed like Fox Queen was no longer being hampered by the palace. She was able to use her full deified powers without limit or restriction.

Han Sen looked closer and realized what was going on. Edward and the others had managed to break the restrictions of the palace. Their actions had triggered the prison’s defense systems, allowing Fox Queen to use her full powers to annihilate the invaders. Now that Fox Queen had all her deified power back, she was a totally different being than she had been when Han Sen met her.

“I’m so sorry! We accidentally wandered into this place. We meant you no harm. Please forgive us...” Before Edward could finish his apology, a cord of power wrapped around him.

Not long after, the last of the intruders were bound by Fox Queen’s cords. None of them could fight back.

When Fox Queen turned back to Han Sen, he quickly said, “Big Sis, you are so good! You are so intelligent, beautiful, and powerful!”

“I think I heard them refer to you by the name of Han Sen.” Fox Queen stared at Han Sen and gave him a predatory smile.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
