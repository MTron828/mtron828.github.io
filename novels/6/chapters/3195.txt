Chapter 3196 Pulling Out a Sword

“Mister Crown Prince, let’s summon a gene race to protect your body before you draw the sword of your choice.” Thousand Mile Reach and Jia Shi Zhen did not delay. One went left, and one went right. They followed Qin Bai, ready to save him the moment he needed to be saved.

“There is no need.” Qin Bai walked up to the big sword. He reached his hand out to touch the sword’s grip, but it was too high. After he touched the handle, he could not use any strength.

Seeing that the big great sword had a blunted blade, Qin Bai used his body to hold the sword and pull it.

The scared Thousand Mile Reach and Jia Shi Zhen knew that with this kind of pulling, assuming the great sword did not approve of Qin Bai, it would attack Qin Bai’s body. He would not be given any time to react.

The two of them wanted to stop that from happening, but Qin Bai had already pulled the diamond great sword out. Suddenly, there was a buzzing sound. The great sword exploded with a sharp sword light. It broke Qin Bai’s armor, dying his armor with blood.

Jia Shi Zhen’s reactions were blisteringly quick. She fired out a lightning-like sword light to send the great sword flying away.

Thousand Mile Reach flew and grabbed Qin Bai. He immediately examined Qin Bai’s wounds. Fortunately, Jia Shi Zhen’s reactions had been fast enough. Before the great sword could strike Qin Bai’s ribcage, it had only damaged his skin.

Jia Shi Zhen unleashed another sword light to cut the diamond great sword in half. After the diamond great sword was broken, it self-destructed. It turned into a mushroom cloud until it fizzed away into dust.

If Jia Shi Zhen had hit the great sword while Qin Bai was holding it, it would have blown Qin Bai into dust.

Qin Bai’s eyes were open wide. He looked at his chest, which was bleeding profusely. He only now realized what had happened. He felt pain and said, “Ow... It is hurting like hell...”

Qin Bai had never felt pain this severe before. It made his eyes bring on the waterworks, which also made his nose snotty. Thousand Mile Reach summoned a healing power gene race to heal Qin Bai. “Mister Crown Prince, it is only a small wound. There is no need for you to shout this much.” Han Sen squatted down next to Qin Bai and heartily laughed. “You are not the one who is hurting, so, of course, you don’t feel hurt,” Qin Bai responded through the wails and tears.

Han Sen laughed but did not reply. The wounds he had incurred were far worse than the likes Bai Qin had ever seen before. These wounds were nothing.

Han Sen could not tell Bao Qin something like that. He smiled at him and said, “Right, if it was me, I would not touch the swords randomly either. I would not go and collect any without first getting a gene race. Mister Crown Prince, you are way too brave.” “You... You... You are saying things to mock me,” Qin Bai madly said.

Han Sen laughed. Bao’er added, “You are brave, but you are also weak. You cannot even conquer a sword. You are a weak ass.”

“Who said I cannot do it? I just missed. That’s all.” Qin Bai was annoyed as he spoke. He wanted to get angry, but it was Bao’er who was talking. So, he made himself sound weaker again.

“You missed, huh? In that case, pick up a few more and let me see your true might.” Bao’er looked at Qin Bai with interest.

Qin Bai was a little bit scared, but he liked having a bit of a reputation. Thus, he shouted, “I am not afraid of you!” Bao’er would not let him go. She laughed and said, “Sure. In that case, you go right ahead and pick another one up. I bet you will end up peeing your pants.”

The wounds on Qin Bai’s body had already been healed by Thousand Mile Reach. Hearing Bao’er say what she did, Qin Bai could not help but say, “Hmph. Watch your tongue, Bao’er. I am going to show you how I pick one up.” Thousand Mile Reach looked at Han Sen, hoping he would stop this contest. Han Sen behaved as if nothing was going on. He was merely talking with Jian Bu Gu.

Qin Bai said he was so powerful, but he did not move his feet. He peered at Han Sen with a beggar-like look. He quickly noticed that Han Sen was not even looking at him. He was just talking to Jian Bu Gu.

“What is it? Do you really not dare to try?” Bao’er asked as she lifted her lips.

“There is nothing I would not dare to do,” Qin Bai said. He gnashed his teeth and started looking around. He went off in the direction of a little stick. It was bronze and looked very small and thin.

Because of what happened last time, Qin Bai did not go and select a weapon that looked so mighty. That bronze stick looked safer. He wagered the damage it might deal would not be so high.

After what happened last time, Qin Bai summoned the strongest gene race he had at first. After he combined with it, he went to the bronze stick.

He had a lot of god-class gene races to combine with, but his power was limited. Since he had always skimped on his practices, he could only combine with one gene race. He could not combine with many.

He carefully walked to the bronze stick. He cautiously generated the power of the gene race and enabled the gold light to protect his body and hands. Qin Bai then used power to

pull.

He pulled out the bronze stick, but his hands were trembling. It was like the blade was trying to struggle to break free from his hands.

Qin Bai held it tight as he shouted, “You are mine!”

The bronze stick was incapable of escaping. It eventually decided to self-destruct. Its power was not as strong as the gene race Qin Bai had, but the explosion released a strong power that blew Qin Bai backward and onto the ground. He was not injured, but his hands felt numb.

“You are too weak,” Bao’er said with a shake of her head and a lengthy sigh. “You cannot even conquer a short, broken, bronze stick.” Qin Bai’s face turned red. He did not say a word. He climbed to his feet and marched straight toward another weapon.

He noticed that with the protection of a god-class gene race, the weapons were not all that scary. They just made him hurt a little. He was able to endure the pain.

Qin Bai’s luck was not so fortunate. He pulled out seven weapons. None of them approved him to be their master. They all self-destructed.

It was lucky he was Qin Bai, the crown prince of the Qin Kingdom. He had gene races with immense power. The explosions of normal weapons could not hurt him. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Eventually, hits like these stacked up. Qin Bai was no longer able to accept them.

He felt very depressed and thought, “Bao’er managed to easily pull them out. So many emerald short swords approved her. I have pulled out so many, so why have I yet found one that approves me? Am I really that useless?”

“Han Sen, am I really useless? Why do the weapons not approve of me as their master?” Qin Bai started to doubt his life.

Thousand Mile Reach and Jia Shi Zhen both sighed. The heart of an item was like the heart of a person. Qin Bai always loved to goof around, so he had yet to be stabilized. There was no way the weapons were going to approve of him.

Han Sen laughed. “Crown Prince, you just haven’t found a way to use them correctly yet. If you use the right method, getting the approval of one of those weapons is not difficult.”

Qin Bai’s face turned bright as he said, “I see. What kind of method do you need?”

“Bao’er, give your wooden sword to the crown prince to use,” Han Sen said to Bao’er.

Bao’er drew the small wooden sword and passed it to Qin Bai. Han Sen then said, “Hold this sword and try to pull out the weapon from that side.”

Qin Bai was feeling rather hopeful as he held the wooden sword. He walked to the weapon Han Sen had pointed at. It was another diamond great sword.

“Can I really do this?” Qin Bai did not believe it. He looked at Han Sen.

“Why not just give it a go?” Han Sen asked with a smile.

Qin Bai gnashed his teeth. He used gene race power to protect his body. He grabbed the great sword and gave it a big yank. The diamond great sword was pulled free.

This time, the diamond great sword did not attack him. He managed to hold it flawlessly. It released a god light. It made Qin Bai very shocked and happy. “I really did it!”
