1999 Dongxuan Breakthrough

Ghost Teeth Knife’s fire was getting scary. The power kept building, and Lone Bamboo was on the verge of losing all control. He was going to generate the strongest strike he could to end the fight and kill Han Sen.

The frightening knife flames lay seemed to exert incredible force on the broken arena, and the floor had already dropped a few feet. Han Sen’s knifemind and depression were harming him. He could not unleash the power or the sensations inside his body.

But suppression like that made Han Sen feel energized. When people like Han Sen were put under greater pressure, they could perform much better.

Facing Lone Bamboo, who had just become a Marquise, heightened Han Sen’s desire to win. The negativity he was under now affected him far less.

Spell’s armor was flashing white. Her skin and bones turned a jade color. The blood in Han Sen’s body was boiling and roaring.

Han Sen raised the jade sword in his hand. That jade sword lacked special powers, but it had not so much as cracked in the intense fighting. It was a testament to the quality of its craft.

Han Sen looked at Lone Bamboo, and then he stroked the blade of the jade sword. He poured power into it, but the power was very tame. It rested inside the sword, waiting to be unleashed.

Seeing Han Sen’s behavior, Yun Suyi grabbed Yun Sushang and asked, “Is Han Sen hoping to accept this next attack?”

“It seems that way.” Yun Sushang did not understand, either. If both fighters were Marquise, then Han Sen might have stood a chance. With an entire tier between them, however, there was no way Han Sen could withstand such an attack.

“He has no choice but to accept this strike,” Yun Changkong said.

“Why?” Yun Suyi asked, confused.

“The arena is too small. Lone Bamboo’s demon has locked down the entire arena. If Han Sen is still in that arena, he won’t be able to evade it. So, he has to muster what he has to take it,” Yun Changkong said.

“Can he defend against it? There is a whole level of difference between Earls and Marquises.” Yun Suyi’s voice sounded shaky. She looked disturbed.

Yes, he can endure it.” Before Yun Changkong answered, someone else walked in and answered the question for him.

Yun Suyi looked over towards the voice, and she saw a man staring down on the arena. His eyes were red. He looked more nervous than the fighters on the field.

“Yu Jing, how do you know Han Sen can endure this attack?” Thousand Feather Crane asked Yu Jing.

“Fenghou Pills. I gave him a Fenghou Pill. If he takes it, he can temporarily wield the power of a Marquise. So, yes; he can take this attack, and he will win.” Yu Jing sounded like he was talking to himself, trying to make himself feel better.

“Fenghou Pills?” Yun Sushang and the others were shocked. “Why did you give him Fenghou Pills?”

“I bet every penny I had that he would win ten times in a row. He has to win; it’s either that or bankruptcy.” Yu Jing sounded like his words had been squeezed out through his teeth. His fists were clenched so hard, his nails were digging into the flesh.

If Han Sen’s opponent hadn’t been Lone Bamboo, Yu Jing would not have been so desperate. But the match was on now, and all was on the line. If Han Sen lost, Yu Jing would be dealt a devastating blow.

“It is good for him to have the Fenghou Pills. In that case, Han Sen can win.” Yun Suyi was very happy to hear Han Sen still had a chance.

Yun Changkong sighed and said, “He would have a chance if he had eaten it at the beginning. Now it is too late.”

“What is too late?” Yu Jing demanded. His sudden fear made him rather impolite.

Yun Changkong did not mind, though. He calmly said, “Lone Bamboo’s knifemind has already locked on to Han Sen. Any mistake on his part will prompt Lone Bamboo to attack. Do you think he has the time to take a pill?”

Yu Jing looked as if he had been electrified. He froze on the spot.

Yun Suyi had just been feeling calmer, but now she was nervous again. She said, “What do we do? Will Lone Bamboo kill Han Sen?”

“It is doubtful that the leader would stand idly by and let Han Sen be murdered. But if he stops this now, then Lone Bamboo will be destroyed,” Yun Changkong said with regret.

In the arena, Ghost Teeth Knife’s power was increasing. Han Sen was holding the jade sword between himself and the knifemind. He was like a mountain, and he wasn’t affected.

An amazing energy was coursing through Han Sen’s body. It was the Dongxuan Sutra. Under the suppression of his opponent, the Dongxuan Sutra was finally having a breakthrough. It was becoming Earl class, and the Dongxuan Aura was imbuing Han Sen with a grander power.

Although it was not enough to fight back Lone Bamboo’s knifemind, the energy release was making Han Sen’s eyes clearer.

The knifemind and the depression were things that Han Sen could see as sequence chains. They looked like a giant spider web, all around Han Sen.

When the Dongxuan Aura got stronger, the sequence chain became easier to discern. A level of detail that he had never previously discerned was now becoming clear.

Boom!

The Dongxuan Sutra’s power exploded in Han Sen’s body. It was like it was breaking all the cells inside Han Sen’s body. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Although the feeling was destructive and strange, it gave Han Sen the sense of chains being severed. Under the suppression of the knifemind and the depression, he felt rather relaxed. He felt as if he was facing a fire and a wind, but they were raging around him rather than against him.

The pressure suddenly disappeared. No matter how powerful it was, in Han Sen’s eye, it was just a sequence chain.

Two different powers were rising inside Han Sen’s body, and they were pumped into the jade sword. The sword started to shine with a bright light.

Teeth Knife knifemind began to synergize with Han Sen’s swordmind. They fit together like two halves of a zipper. Two completely different powers were combining into one inside the jade sword. The light from the jade sword extinguished the knife’s fire.

Han Sen stood silently, holding the sword before him. He was like a god, standing amidst the knife’s fire. No matter how much Lone Bamboo or Ghost Teeth Knife leveled up, they could not suppress Han Sen’s power.
