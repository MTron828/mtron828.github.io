Chapter 2547: Not Teleportation

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The creature looked humanoid. Because it was wrapped up in black armor, it was impossible to tell exactly what it looked like. It just stood behind the Demon King.

“Sir, I have brought you the Demon Doll.” The Demon King brought the Demon Doll before Ji Yang Sheng, then raised both hands, presenting a purple horn.

The purple horn was around one foot long, and its surface was ribbed like a screw. It was crescent-shaped, and many strange symbols were carved around its top. It looked so pretty, but also so mysterious.

The horn looked like the horns on the heads of Demons like Ji Yang Sheng. Ji Yang Sheng didn’t know what it was.

Ji Yang Sheng took the purple horn and turned it over in his hands. Then, he spoke to the Demon Doll. “Listen to my commands and go.”

Ji Yang Sheng’s eyes flashed with purple. A purple aura rose from his hands, then swept into the purple horn. That weird and beautiful purple horn glowed and flashed. The weird symbols across it started to release a demonic smoke.

The Demon Doll flashed with purple. It zoomed off in Han Sen’s direction at a blistering speed.

“Sir, you must be careful. We cannot allow any other race to end up capturing the Demon Doll.” The Demon King looked worried as he spoke.

“Don’t worry. With the Demon Doll’s power, even if I cannot get Han Sen, what else in the core area could threaten it?” Ji Yang Sheng looked annoyed.

The Demon King nodded and retreated. After that, he said nothing more.

...

A shoal of shark-sized, mechanical demon fish were flying through space. As they headed for Han Sen, they spat out scary streaks of lightning, turning the system into an electrified ocean. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Seeing the ocean of lightning bearing down on them, Elysian Moon summoned a blue oil-paper umbrella in her hands. After the umbrella was opened, a swordlight was unleashed. It blocked all the streaks of lightning from hitting the umbrella. The three of them were shielded by it, too, which meant the lightning was of no concern to them.

Gu Qingcheng lifted a hand, unleashing countless swordlights. Swords of all kinds appeared around her, like a galactic waterfall of blades being fired at the mechanical demon fish.

In a second, over a hundred of the demon fish were chopped to pieces.

“Your Thousand Sword Area is very powerful!” Han Sen complimented her. The shoal of mechanical demon fish had three Kings. They couldn’t block Gu Qingcheng’s attack at all, though. Gu Qingcheng’s area was overbearing.

“Is my area weak or something? Is that what you’re trying to say?” Elysian Moon asked in annoyance.

Han Sen opened his mouth to respond, but Elysian Moon was staring out into empty space. Han Sen and Gu Qingcheng turned to look at what might have caught her attention, and there, they saw a black shadow drawing toward them. It wasn’t moving quickly; it was just sort of floating through space.

After a while, the shadow flew close enough that they could see it clearly.

That man in black armor didn’t mean to stop, however. He was still coming for Han Sen.

“Why have you come here, and why are you going after me?” Han Sen asked, looking at the man in black armor.

But the black armor man didn’t react. It was as if he hadn’t heard Han Sen, and still, he approached.

Han Sen noticed the being was only looking at him. Han Sen was the man’s target, and the man was coming right for him.

Seeing the black armor enter their radius, Han Sen spoke again. “You should stop right there.”

The armored man behaved as if he hadn’t heard a thing. He didn’t stop, and he even raised a fist to punch Han Sen. When that punch was unleashed, his entire body disappeared from the vision of all those who watched.

When he reappeared, he was directly in front of Han Sen. That violent fist of his was about to strike Han Sen’s head and rattle his skull.

“Very powerful teleportation.” Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon’s eyes widened. They weren’t sure how the armored man had come right before Han Sen like that. It was quite bewildering.

According to the theory, there were two types of teleportation. One of them was a speed-type teleportation, and the other one was a space-type teleportation. When a teleportation skill was used, there were distinctive traits that distinguish one type of teleportation from the other.

Speed-type teleportation only required a strong eye to follow its movement. So, you could still see it.

Space-type teleportation was different. When space and air were broken, a space shockwave was released. It took time to build up that wave. Even skills like God’s Wander had this flaw, but the shockwave of God’s Wander was small. It didn’t take much time to activate, so it would be difficult to feel.

But this armored man, from the time he lifted his fist to when he appeared before Han Sen, did not leave any trace of his teleportation. There was no shockwave or anything. It was like he was just there, not giving anyone a chance to react.

Dong!

Han Sen raised his fist to block the armored man’s attack, but his entire body felt electrified on-contact. It was extremely powerful, and the strike sent him flying away like a falling star.

Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon looked shocked. They knew how strong Han Sen was. Although he was just a fourth-tier King, he was as strong as a half-deified. No power should have been able to beat Han Sen unless it was a half-deified with a focus on raw power.

The armored man punched Han Sen and sent him flying once again. The power that the armored man wielded had to be amongst the greatest any half-deified could wield. It was nuts.

Without hesitation, Gu Qingcheng drew her sword. A mysterious trail followed the bronze blade as the old sword moved to strike the armored man. When she used the old bronze sword, countless sword shadows were unleashed in eight directions. It was like a galaxy of blades were sent soaring over toward the armored man.

Elysian Moon attacked from the other side as this occurred. She closed her blue oil-paper umbrella and used it as a sword to thrust at the armored man’s heart. The swordlight became a scary glow that could break through a planet.

The two of them blocked all of the armored man’s exits, but the armored man ignored their attacks. He flew after Han Sen, punching as he went.

Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon were enraged by that. The armored man was being so cocky by ignoring their attacks. It was like they were just clutching toys, and there was no need to pay attention to them.

They sent more power surging into their umbrella and swords. Elysian Moon coldly said, “Advice for the future: whatever you do, do not underestimate women. It’s a fatal mistake.”

But right before Elysian Moon finished speaking, her eyes opened wide.

When the armored man threw his punch, he just disappeared from their vision. The net of swordlights did nothing to stop him.

“That isn’t space teleportation.” Gu Qingcheng’s face paled slightly. She looked confused. She hadn’t seen any distortion to the space around them. She didn’t know how the armored man had managed to escape their sight.
