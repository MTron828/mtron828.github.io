Chapter 2949 Weird Atmosphere

The Sky Palace’s first seat used a changing ground and changing sky method. He wanted to change space so the eyeless big beast could not get close to him.This time, the eyeless big beast did not get affected by the swap of the sky and earth. Although space was different, the eyeless big beast was still headed for Sky Palace’s first seat. It was rolling faster and faster. It quickly arrived in front of Sky Palace’s first seat.

Sky Palace’s first seat’s expression changed. He immediately waved his sleeves. Space resided within his sleeves. He wanted to suck the eyeless big beast into it.

Just as the eyeless big beast was about to approach the sleeves, it suddenly stopped. The creature’s mouth turned into a speaker in space. It blew wind at Sky Palace’s first seat.

Doo!

It sounded like a ship’s foghorn. The moment the sound was heard, one saw shockwaves come out of the eyeless big beast. They came out like water waves that enveloped Sky Palace’s first seat. The waves turned into a sonic ring that wrapped up Sky Palace’s first seat’s body.

Sky Palace’s body’s Very High power was madly running, but he could not break the grip of the sonic ring that had a hold of him. He was trapped by the sonic ring.

The eyeless big beast turned around with the intent to leave with the sonic ring pulling Sky Palace’s first seat with him. They returned to the demon lady.

On the other side, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster had not been granted a moment to speak. The fish bird was too fast. The continuous attacks were too much for Ancient Abyss Grandmaster to deal with. He suddenly had lots of wounds. In the end, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster flashed away and retreated into the darkness. The fish bird chased him for a while but soon returned. Based on his expression, it was unlikely he managed to catch up with Ancient Abyss Grandmaster.

“This guy’s geno arts are weird,” the fish bird said upon his return. “He can travel around the barren powers. He managed to escape!”

“It is fine,” the demon lady said. “It is not hard to guess what the Extreme King is doing here. Just ignore him.”

Everyone returned their attention to Han Sen. Sky Palace’s first seat was struggling. He was incapable of escaping the power of the sonic ring that had snared him.

The demon lady stared at Han Sen and said, “Give me the holy spirit, and I will permit you to live.”

Han Sen did not answer her. He just measured them all with his eyes. In the image Old Cat had brought to him before, Han Sen had seen the demon girl and others. He knew he had come to the right place to find Littleflower.

“We are asking you a question!” Old Vulture madly shouted. “Stop being frozen!”

Nine Thousand King quickly flashed behind Han Sen. He faced the demon lady and said, “You guys must believe me. It really was the master who asked me to protect Han Sen and lead him to the holy hall. The master’s soul remains in the statue inside the holy garden.”

“Carry on as you please and keep making up your story.” Red Ghost coldly laughed. “The holy garden’s statue is what the master prepared for Miss Wan’er. Why would his soul be inside there?”

Nine Thousand King was frozen. He could not explain it. He thought in his heart, “Master, master, I would do anything for you and the person you love. But dying at the hands of our own people... This is terrible. Master, you were always so smart. How could you not foresee this happening?”

Nine Thousand King made a decision and said to Han Sen, “Mister Han, you should leave first. I will slow them down.”

Upon hearing that, Old Vulture and Red Ghost laughed. “Slow us down? How? Are you going to use your One Second Is a Thousand Years? Even if you squander all of your lifespan, how much can you truly delay us?”

“Old Servant, you are very loyal to your new master.” The demon lady looked at Han Sen.

“Old Nine, you fall back,” Han Sen said to Nine Thousand King, who was in front of him.

“Mister Han...” Nine Thousand King wished to say something, but Han Sen stopped him.

Han Sen signaled Nine Thousand King to fall back. He looked at the demon lady and asked, “Are you Auntie Mei?”

The demon lady, Old Vulture, and the others were shocked. The titles of Auntie Mei and Old Vulture were something they reserved for themselves. No one else should have known that.

That was especially true for Auntie Mei. It only started when Littleflower was there. Only Littleflower called her that. Old Vulture and the others just called her a horny woman.

“Do you know me?” The demon lady frowned and looked at Han Sen. Now that she thought about it, he did look a bit familiar.

“I am Han Sen. I have come looking for Littleflower. Please, everyone, allow me to be with my son once again.” Han Sen bowed before them. He was being polite. If it didn’t work out, he would have to use force.

“You are Han Sen!” Auntie Mei and the others were shocked upon hearing that name.

They knew Littleflower’s biological father was Han Sen. To them, it did not really matter who his father was, so they never cared about what Han Sen looked like. Even if they saw him on the street, they would not have recognized him. They would not have cared.

Old Vulture’s eyes were open wide as he looked at Han Sen. He screamed, “You are... Little Master’s father?”

Nine Thousand King was frozen. He had no idea what had become of the situation. His brain could not function. He ended up saying, “What does this mean? Old Vulture said Han Sen is the Little Master’s father. That means Old Vulture has a new master, and the new master is Mister Han’s son. Wait a minute...”

Nine Thousand King’s eyes turned bright. He suddenly thought of something. He slapped his legs and thought, “I see it now. I see it now... I knew it. Master has it all prepared. He must have known this would happen... I see it now... Ha! Ha!”

“I could not have foreseen this. I really couldn’t have. Master and Mister Han had a child. With Old Vulture and the demon lady’s personality, if it was not for the master’s child, they would not have taken it as a leader. This must be right. Master wanted me to protect Little Master’s father... Wait... No... Father? How could two fathers make a baby? Whatever... With the master’s power, he can do anything!” Nine Thousand King thought that seemed right. He thought he was saved.

After Nine Thousand King thought of this, he started laughing. He laughed and said, “You are all family. Why are you still fighting? Hurry up and invite Mister Han into the holy palace.”

The demon lady and the others all looked at each other. They did not know what to do about this. They never thought Littleflower’s father, a guy who had come out of the sanctuaries without anyone’s help, had become deified. On top of that, he had managed to claim old monsters like Nine Thousand King. Now, there he was, in Sacred, getting his son back. This was far beyond their expectation. They never thought this might happen. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Sky Palace’s first seat, who was trapped, was going to escape while they were fighting Nine Thousand King. Who would have known it would turn into a family reunion of sorts? And, Han Sen had become the new Sacred Leader’s father. He was shocked.

“Does this mean that child has become Sacred’s new master...” Sky Palace’s first seat thought about Littleflower. He had wanted to take him to Sky Palace, but he accidentally let Han Sen escape. He did not expect that child to become the new master of Sacred.

Everybody was thinking, but no one was speaking. The scene had become extremely strange.
