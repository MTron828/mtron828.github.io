Chapter 2686 Under the Sky Knife

Li Xue Cheng and Liyu Zhen’s faces were turning green. They felt like they were going crazy. Their eyes were full of red, bloodshot lines, and they clenched their fists tightly, unaware that their nails were digging into the palms of their hands. They were like two madmen as they watched Han Sen make battle.

“Impossible... This is impossible...” They felt as if they were going to suffocate.

A half-deified was fighting a deified and was no worse for wear. It made them feel more and more nervous about how things were going to turn out. They were afraid that the unthinkable might actually happen, and they might lose their bet.

“No way... There is absolutely no way that a half-deified can defeat a deified in combat like this... Plus, this deified is the one and only Shale... Our fears cannot come to pass. I am positive Shale will win...” Liyu Zhen hissed slowly, gnashing his teeth. It was like he was speaking to himself as much as to Li Xue Cheng. His eyes remained glued to the screen in front of him.

Shale’s eyebrows were furrowed slightly. Although he was still in charge of the situation, he did feel as if there was something wrong. Every move Han Sen made seemed to be guided by the hand of God. Shale had difficulty repelling even the most casual slash that Han Sen directed toward him. Ordinary strikes were more effective than should have been possible. Regardless of how much he analyzed Han Sen’s techniques, Shale didn’t understand what was happening.

Shale wasn’t someone who was willing to just lay down and let himself lose. So, when he felt that something was wrong, he made the best decision he could. The hellish flames around his body roared high, and he ignored Han Sen’s attacks and rushed toward his opponent.

“No matter how dexterous you are with your skills, your power is no match for mine. My power will crush you and your skills alike. I can summon enough force to break your techniques.” Shale was like a demon god. He carried scary substance chains with him as he thundered forward to suppress his foe.

Han Sen’s knife air slashed at him, but the substance chains crushed it. Han Sen was unable to break through the substance chains to damage Shale’s body.

Han Sen didn’t panic, though. His body floated from side to side like a cloud. Shale had gathered an immense amount of raging power, but he was unable to hurt Han Sen. It was like watching a little boat go up against a big wave.

The big waves were going wild, but they couldn’t flip the boat that effortlessly surfed from crest to crest.

Han Sen was like a holy man that could ride the wind. His body was brimming with the energy of his knifemind. Shale continued to bump Han Sen around, but he couldn’t ruffle Han Sen’s clothing.

Bixi watched Han Sen and Shale’s fight with a gaping mouth. “Will Shale...”

He was wondering if Shale was going to lose, but he realized he shouldn’t make such a suggestion in front of Li Chung Qiu. So, he swallowed the words.

“I’m afraid he is going to lose. Shale is strong, but he comes from a bad place. His practice time was too short. If there had been another three years to train him, perhaps he wouldn’t be in this situation,” Li Chung Qiu said coldly.

Bixi nodded. “That kid Han Sen is lucky, eh? But by the way, his knifemind really is something quite special. It exudes the presence of Sky and Men Combined Together.”

“That isn’t Sky and Men Combined Together. He is just following the will of the sky,” Li Chung Qiu said.

“Compared to you, Big Brother, he is nothing. But compared to ordinary people and creatures, his will is disturbingly impressive,” Bixi said after a moment.

Li Chung Qiu nodded and said, “Exquisite and Li Keer both use Han Sen as their silkworm. Outside of the Very High, a genius like this is very rare.”

Open Sky Elder looked very relaxed right now. He smiled and said, “Deified... So what, even if you are deified? You are still going to lose. My eyesight isn’t too bad.”

Qiyu Elder looked at him with disdain. When Shale became deified, Open Sky Elder looked like he was watching his own parents die. But of course, Qiyu Elder didn’t say that out loud.

As the fight went on, more and more of the Very High noticed that Han Sen’s grim situation had taken a turn for the better. Shale fought with bestial strength, but he still couldn’t bring damage to Han Sen.

“Han Sen’s knife skills are very good.”

“They are more than good. They are top class. They really are knife skills that come from the Sky.”

“Of course. The Sky were kicked out by our race. We should expect this from one of their knife skills.”

“Hey! Hey! How about this? If Han Sen really does achieve first place, I wonder what that *sshole Li Xue Cheng’s face will look like.”

“I still don’t think he will win. Han Sen’s knife skills are strong, but his power isn’t any better than Shale’s. Shale cannot hurt him, but he cannot hurt Shale. This fight will end without a winner, but neither will there be a loser. If they fight long enough, maybe the stamina of the half-deified will deplete. With the deified having greater stamina, he will be able to outlast and win that way.”

“Who knows? You’re making a lot of guesses, there.”

“Haha! If Han Sen takes first place, Li Xue Cheng’s face will look brilliant.”

“Li Xue Cheng won’t be the only person devastated. Liyu Zhen will be in the same boat. Without Liyu Zhen, Li Xue Cheng would never have known treasures weren’t allowed to be used in this silkworm bout.”

“I really hope Han Sen wins. And then, I want to see the faces of those two *ssholes. How dare they try to trick us.”

...

Li Xue Cheng and Liyu Zhen’s faces already looked fairly amazing. Their eyes had almost popped out of their sockets as they watched the battle video. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“He won’t lose... Shale will not lose this... He will win. He will win...” The two of them were going insane. Their mouths kept repeating those sentences. The unease within them was growing with every passing second.

“The sky and the ground are like a game of chess that keeps changing. Everything is like a knife, and they all have a path. Shale, try to taste my Under the Sky knife.” Han Sen’s knifemind was like a volcano that could no longer keep its magma inside. It erupted in a large fountain at Shale. Han Sen used his hand like a knife and slashed towards him.

“Good job.” Shale had power, but there had been nowhere for him to use it. Now that Han Sen wanted to fight directly, this was perfect for him. Scary substance chains gathered on his fist, and he threw his fist forward to meet Han Sen’s attack.

Buzz!

Space rippled and shattered under the force of Shale’s punch. Substance chains that looked like demon lions ripped through reality around him. Lion mouths became giant black holes in space, and they tried to swallow Han Sen.

But Han Sen remained unmoving. His hand kept swinging downward, but no knife air appeared around his hand. His hand fell in a simple cutting motion.

The sight filled the audience with confusion. As they watched, they saw all of the mountains and rivers of the valley, the grass, the flowers, and the woods, become consumed by a knife light. All different kinds of knife lights all across the valley lit up. Knight lights suddenly seemed to make up the entire landscape around the two fighters. And all of those attacks were coming for Shale.

Countless knife lights crossed each other. There were so many, it was like a flood. All of them surged toward Shale and his demonic lions.

Shale summoned the power of his substance chains. He wasn’t afraid of those King class knife lights, but he realized belatedly that there were too many of them. Scary demon lion punch powers and substance chains were breaking in the middle of that knife light.
