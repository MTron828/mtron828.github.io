Chapter 2239 Shocking Changes

Han Sen was sleeping on his bed with Little Silver lying next to him. Little Silver suddenly got up, and silver lightning sparked to life across his body. It grew in volume, illuminating the room in chaotic flashes. His silver eyes stared toward the door.

Han Sen woke up, and across the room, Little Star was shaking off sleep as well.

Han Yan and the other girls were sleeping in the next room down the hall.

When Han Sen scanned the hall with the Dongxuan Aura, his face hardened. Before he could react, there was a knock on the door.

“Han Sen, Knight King wishes to see you,” said the knight delivering the message, his voice coming from just outside the door.

Ordinarily, Han Sen wouldn’t mind the intrusion, and he would politely open the door. But this time was different. Little Silver was very smart, and he could always discern who was a friend and who was a foe. If he was showing hostility to an Ice Blue Knight in the base, then he must have had a reason. He was gathering up power as if he was prepping for a fight.

Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to scan outside the room, and a lump formed in his throat. It felt as if a mountain-sized stone had dropped into his heart.

“Ice Blue Knight King is outside,” Han Sen thought. Although he couldn’t see or feel the presence of Ice Blue Knight King, Han Sen’s senses were telling him that the man was looming out there like a mountain.

Although Han Sen didn’t know why Ice Blue Knight King had come personally, he knew it was for nothing good. Plus, the knight who knocked on the door had said that the Knight King wished to see Han Sen. He made no mention of him already being there.

Now, Ice Blue Knight King was standing outside the room and masking his presence. In addition to being abnormal, it was simply impolite.

“Okay, wait a second. I’ll be right there,” Han Sen called back, pretending to get dressed.

Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to peer outside the room again. There, he found other Ice Blue Knights knocking on the door of the girls’ room. Han Sen’s nerves were starting to make him ill.

Thinking fast, Han Sen picked up Little Silvernand set him down on Little Star’s back. Little Star knew what Han Sen wanted, and so he immediately activated his Starsea Travel and took them through the wall to the next room.

Han Yan and the others jumped slightly as Little Star came through the wall with Han Sen and Little Silver. They looked surprised, but they quickly realized what was going on.

Han Sen didn’t have time to explain, so he summoned Destiny’s Tower and quietly said, “Get in.”

Zero and Han Meng’er leaped inside without a word. Ji Qing started to ask something, but before she could, Han Yan pulled her inside.

Huangfu Jing was very fast, and she jumped in without a moment’s hesitation.

Han Sen tossed Little Silver and Little Star in as well. Only Bao’er remained on Han Sen’s shoulder. Little Angel was standing very still, peering at the door.

“Get in!” Han Sen hissed under his breath. He wasn’t sure what was wrong with Little Angel. She had never disobeyed a command before.

Little Angel didn’t enter Destiny’s Tower. Instead, she just approached Han Sen and spread her wings. The angelic halo glowed to life over her head.

Her youthful body suddenly transformed into a busty angel with blonde, waving hair. A crystal feather sword appeared in her hand.

Little Angel had triggered her angel mode. She had sensed danger.

“I can deal with this! You just need to get inside.” Han Sen sensed that Ice Blue Knight King was right outside the door. He knew Han Sen had moved to the other room.

Before Han Sen could say anything more, Little Angel flapped her angel wings, flew in front of Han Sen, and spread her angelic wings wider. Her clear eyes peered right into Han Sen, and then, her red lips came down toward his own. She kissed him firmly.

Han Sen felt a raw surge of power enter him through his mouth. Little Angel’s entire body was glowing with holy light, and that holy light rushed right into Han Sen.

Boom!

Angel wings spread from Han Sen’s back as a halo appeared over his head. His entire body shone with white light, and a feathery, angelic sword slid into his hand.

Pure angelic power was combining with Han Sen’s own strength. Han Sen felt his power rise by an insane amount.

Han Sen was surprised by this. Little Angel hadn’t demonstrated this power since she stopped being a mere beast soul. Since she now had a genuine body, he hadn’t thought that she could still combine herself with him.

Han Sen and Little Angel were both Marquises, but Little Angel’s power was so clear. It was almost as strong as Han Sen’s.

The two Marquise powers mingled together, and Han Sen’s power shot past the power ceiling of a Marquise. His entire body felt incredible.

Han Sen knew Little Angel had combined herself with him because she had sensed imminent and extreme danger. If it wasn’t for that, she wouldn’t have taken such drastic action.

The moment Han Sen put Destiny’s Tower back in the Sea of Soul, the room door was forced open. Han Sen saw Ice Blue Knight King enter; he didn’t use any power, but Han Sen felt waves of pressure rolling off of him.

This was the power of a half-deified being. He was no weaker than Yisha.

“Bao’er!” Han Sen didn’t hesitate. He summoned the dragon wings for his back and his ears, then employed his stone cow body. His skin looked red, and both draconic and angelic wings spread behind him.

Bao’er’s hand slapped the surface of the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum. A shockwave rolled out of the drum, and Han Sen flapped his three pairs of wings. He teleported to the back wall.

Ice Blue Knight King frowned. He used a blue halo to shield himself. The shockwave was like a scorpion’s tail, striking and stinging the Knight King’s head. But the blue halo swirled around him, and the sting couldn’t land and puncture him properly.

“Han Sen, I will ask you this clearly: are you about to desert this army?” Ice Blue Knight King stared at Han Sen, his eyes having followed Han Sen’s teleportation instantly. As he spoke, an unnerving power came out from him.

Han Sen teleported into a hallway, and the Knight King’s power landed on him immediately. It felt like a mountain had slammed into him, and it almost made him collapse on the ground.

“If you were willing to let me explain, you wouldn’t have come here like this,” Han Sen said flatly. Then, he exploded with power to fight off Ice Blue Knight King’s own. He teleported away and broke through the roof of the base as he did. Now, he was in the air.

Han Sen didn’t know if he could escape, but going back to the sanctuary wasn’t an option this time. Han Yan and the others were in Destiny’s Tower. With their level of strength, they would be damaged by the restrictions of the sanctuary. Not even Destiny’s Tower could shield them from that.

If he took them back to the sanctuary, they’d either self-destruct or be thrown out of the sanctuary. Both options would lead to death.

Han Sen gritted his teeth. Before he teleported again, Ice Blue Knight King rose into the air as well. The King looked down at Han Sen from above. That pressure he exuded was hard to explain, but it made Han Sen feel as if the man was a god. It didn’t matter where Han Sen chose to flee; he couldn’t escape from this terrifying being.
