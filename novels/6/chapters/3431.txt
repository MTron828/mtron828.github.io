Chapter 3432: Crape Myrtle’s Backstory

Figuring out that Han Sen’s body had a few issues was not difficult. Being able to trick his body and also injure him to a desperate point without the power in his body activating was something, by all accounts, scary.

Fortunately, without exploding power, Han Sen had a scary body strength. Ten million starlights came down on him but only left a small red mark on his skin.

This type of injury was not too serious. Han Sen was able to endure the pain. Not seeing a way out of this predicament was the scariest thing.

If he was able to use geno arts, Han Sen would have had 10,000 different ways to break Crape Myrtle’s starlights. Now, there was nothing he could do.

In Space Garden, Tang Zhenliu was a bit worried as he asked, “Is Han Sen going to be fine up there?”

Huangfu Jing did not talk any crap… She looked at Han Yufei and asked, “Sister Han, do you know anything about Crape Myrtle’s backstory?”

Anyone was able to tell that Crape Myrtle was not just a mere Destroyed-class God Spirit like he had described himself earlier. With the power he wielded, even an Annihilation-class God Spirit could do the same as him.

Han Yufei was silent a moment before saying, “I have never heard of this God Spirit before. From what I best know, he is not one of the 12 Annihilation-class God Spirit. But judging from what his body can do, he has a God Spirit’s spirit body. He is certainly a God Spirit.”

“If he is not an Annihilation-class God Spirit, is he a Reboot-class God Spirit?” Tang Zhenliu asked. “I thought Han Sen said there were only five Reboot-class God Spirit. This Crape Myrtle is not included amongst them, right?”

Han Yufei frowned and did not speak. Clearly, she did not know Crape Myrtle either.

Far away, on a blue planet, a metal and gold god temple sat on an island in the middle of the sea. A man and a woman were lying on the beach, sunbathing while watching Han Sen and Crape Myrtle conduct their combat.

The woman was so pretty that one could not stare at her directly. She looked very cold. It was hard to think about something sensual when it came to her. Even sexual offenders would have felt ashamed of themselves seeing her as they could not think of anything lewd about her.

The man nearby had bronze skin. His chest was wide. He looked like a terrifically masculine and strong bloke.

If Han Sen was able to see them, he would know who they were. The man and the woman were Tai Yi and Moon God.

Moon God watched Han Sen get whipped by starlight. She lifted her lips and said, “Han Sen, that little man, is useless. He cannot even defeat a Destroyed-class, small God Spirit like that.”

Tai Yi laughed heartily and said, “You know who that Crape Myrtle is, yet you are willing to say something like that. Do you disdain Han Sen, or do you disdain Crape Myrtle?”

“Neither of them is good stuff anyway,” Moon God said. She could not help but laugh.

Tai Yi smiled. “No matter what, Han Sen is your heir. If he is defeated too badly, you will only be embarrassed. But it might be Crape Myrtle that beats him. Even so, he has only sustained minor injuries. And that, I must say, is rather surprising.”

“Are you speaking well on Han Sen’s behalf, or speaking well of Crape Myrtle?” Moon God looked displeased. “Crape Myrtle is bullying someone lesser. Does he really think I can be bullied? When you beat up a dog, you better watch out for who the master is. He is my heir.”

Tai Yi laughed. “Do not worry. Crape Myrtle will not do much to Han Sen. He just wants to let Han Sen know his weakness. If Han Sen can find out what that is, it will help Han Sen out. That is the only way Han Sen will be able to defeat Qin Xiu. I suppose it is more like Human King right now.”

Moon God was shocked. “Are you saying that Crape Myrtle thinks Han Sen can fight Human King and defeat him?”

“Yes, that seems like a fair assessment,” Tai Yi said. “Otherwise, Crape Myrtle would not be dealing with things himself and forcing Han Sen to confront his own flaws.”

Moon God displayed a face that made it look as if she was thinking of something, but then she laughed and said, “This is interesting. The leader selected her own daughter. The geno hall selected Han Sen. I thought this situation would have the two share the same opinion. I thought they would co-operate. I did not think there would still be conflict. I suppose the God Chaos Party and the geno hall were always supposed to be enemies.”

“They are not really enemies.” Tai Yi looked at Moon God and said, “Crape Myrtle has always taken care of Han Sen. In the past, I thought it was all because of Bao’er, and that is why he took care of Han Sen. Now, I think he had already picked Han Sen long before.”

“Do you think he selected Han Sen? That does not seem possible. Han Sen’s body is strange now, but we still do not know if he can yet walk the step. Even if he can walk the step, Crape Myrtle would not have had the foresight to see all of Han Sen’s achievements up until this point unless the old leader is revived. But the old leader wasn’t Crape Myrtle either. He could not see this power.” Moon God looked as if she did not believe him. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Maybe Crape Myrtle could not see Han Sen’s future achievements, but at least he knew Han Sen was Han Jinzhi’s heir, which was why he was willing to engage in the gamble,” Tai Yi said.

“Han Jinzhi? That old con man? How is he related to the geno hall?” Moon God frowned upon hearing Han Jinzhi’s name spoken.

“I only know as much as you do,” Tai Yi seriously said. “To be able to make a wish in front of Crape Myrtle and survive is a very rare accomplishment, but Han Jinzhi is one such person. I heard he was able to beat Crape Myrtle.”

“Hmph. I do not think he is that powerful. All he does is play tricks,” Moon licked her lips as she spoke. If one were to look at her face, it would seem as if she did not like the person known as Han Jinzhi.

“Even if he is just a scammer, to be able to beat the master of the universe is something rather scary,” Tai Yi seriously said. “If you ever see him again, do not forget that little tidbit.”

“I do not believe this. He is a liar. What can he possibly do to someone like me? Plus, he only beat the master of the universe. If a new geno tablet master is born, the leader will change. To beat the geno hall leader will be nothing to be so proud about. If he is so good, why does not fight for his heir and get that Qin Xiu… that Human King?” Moon God grunted.

Tai Yi felt depressed. He shook his head and said, “That person is mysterious. I do not know his motives either. I thought he might be able to beat the reincarnation of the old leader, but the old leader selected Asura for his spirit body. He combined with Asura. Now, he cannot reincarnate again. If someone ever comes to know who that Han Jinzhi is, it is likely only Crape Myrtle would be the one.”

“They are both just con men,” Moon God said. “They are merely liars. They only have the same interests.”

While they discussed, Han Sen was trapped in starlight. He gathered up power, wanting to break free of the starlight, but his body could not be woken up by the power keeping him down. No matter how he tried, the starlight stopped him.

“If my power cannot be used, then I will just have to use Crape Myrtle’s power,” Han Sen thought as he closed his eyes. He focused on the starlight that rained down on him.
