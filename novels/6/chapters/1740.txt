“Dollar.” Ling Mei’er was delighted to see Han Sen. She already knew Han Sen was his true identity, but that mattered little at this point

“Mei’er, Elder; why are you here?” Han Sen asked in confusion.

Dark Spirit Elder heard Ling Mei’er and remembered Han Sen. With a strange expression, he said, “It is hard to tell.”

Ling Mei’er explained with anger, and when Han Sen heard what had happened, he turned to the Elder. He told him, “Elder and Mei’er, you should head on over to Mask Shelter first. When I get rid of them, you’ll easily be able to go back and reclaim Dark Spirit Shelter.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“We can go and deal with the bad guys alongside you.” Ling Mei’er waved her fist.

“It’s fine. You guys should go on ahead to Mask Shelter and wait,” Han Sen said. He couldn’t really take the gourd if Ling Mei’er was there.

After convincing them to leave, he brought Bao’er to Dark Spirit Shelter with them. It was good news, learning the gourd was still there.

“Elder, can we believe that man?” one of the Dark Spirits asked Dark Spirit Elder.

“He is unpredictable. Whatever the case may be, meeting him is not something you can sit back and ignore,” Dark Spirit Elder said with seriousness as he looked at them.

But he abided by Han Sen’s request, and he commanded his people to seek refuge in Mask Shelter. He himself, however, went on to Dark Spirit Shelter alone.

Han Sen was thinking about how he might get the gourd. He did not want to hurt Ling Mei’er through its theft, so this event had saved him some trouble.

Regardless, the elite elders occupying the shelter were practically nothing to Han Sen now.

Bao’er was looking at the shelter with much excitement. A huge lifeforce was radiating from it, making the underworld creatures stronger. Han Sen could not see the gourd, but he knew this was not something common in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.

The elders and others were all staring at the gourd. While they might have taken the shelter, they still couldn’t take the gourd.

The gourd was like a golden crystal, only a little bit bigger than a man’s hand. But it was an incredibly sturdy thing. Not even an elder-class elite could damage its vines.

“Feather, you know a lot. Do you know what this is?” Beast Elder asked Feather Elder.

Feather Elder said, “I don’t know, but it is definitely not something from the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, It must have come from someplace high above.”

“Dark Spirit had this thing for years. Now it is ours, but we cannot take it? I don’t feel safe. Is there really no way to bring it down?” Beast Elder said.

As they discussed the matter, someone else suddenly appeared.

The man was wearing armor, so you could not see his face. There was a little girl perched upon his shoulder, and they stood in front of the gourd, looking at it.

The elders were so angry over the intrusion, they were ready to quickly destroy the pair.

But before they moved, coins fell down from the sky like rainfall. All the creatures around were hit by at least one of them; especially Beast and Feather. They were unable to dodge the coins, which planted themselves firmly upon the elders’ heads.

Boom!

All at the same time, the creatures fell to the ground. Even the elders did. They were all lying on the floor, unable to get up, no matter how much they tried.

Han Sen didn’t spare time looking at them, however. He remained occupied with gazing upon the gourd.

Dark Spirit Elder was in shock as he watched them from a distance. He knew Han Sen was strong, but he could never have guessed he was that strong.

Beast Elder and Feather Elder were mighty foes. Out of all the other elders there, there were none stronger than those two. But Han Sen did not even have to look or move to suppress them all. It was an incredible display.

“Are you Mister Dollar?” Beast Elder shouted, with actual fear.

“We didn’t know you were here. Please forgive us!” The other elders heard him, and reacted the same.

“From now on, you cannot enter the Underworld. If you do, your tribes will be destroyed.” Han Sen spoke to them, but did not even spare them a glance.

Beast Elder suddenly felt the pressure vanish. And then, he and the rest all got up. They made a promise to never come back, ever again. Taking their men with them, they all left.

For humans, creatures were a resource that could not respawn. So, Han Sen didn’t want to kill them for no reason. He thought it was best to allow other people to do it and earn something.

When everyone was gone, Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to enshroud the entire shelter. Then, he let go of Bao’er, who was wriggling with the desire to run to the gourd.

Bao’er was exuberantly happy, and she leaped for the vine. She hugged the golden gourd.

When Bao’er touched the gourd, it fell from its place and landed on her chest.

“This item really is related to Bao’er.” Han Sen was in shock. He heard Ling Mei’er and the Elder saying they could not remove the gourd, no matter what they tried.

Now, Bao’er had brought it down with just a touch. It definitely had a connection to her.

“It cannot be Bao’er’s sibling, surely. It’d be crazy to have a second Bao’er running around,” Han Sen thought to himself, while staring at the gourd.

Suddenly, the golden gourd Bao’er was hugging began to shine. It did so with the luminosity of a firework.

Mist came out of it, like the cascade of a fountain. The lifeforce that appeared was like a dragon, descending out from the fog. Music could also be heard.

Han Sen looked at the gourd with shock. The power from the gourd was something that really impressed him.

Amidst all these strange scenes, however, something began to rise. When Han Sen looked, he became even more shocked.

A drop of blood emerged from the gourd. It looked like a tear. It looked like it had been forged from a golden crystal, and there was a weird light inside it.

When the gold blood rose, the strange scenes began to fade. The gourd in Bao’er’s hand became pale. It became little more than dust. Then, the wind scattered it all away.

The golden blood was like life. It landed on Bao’er’s forehead and sank down into her. It left a gold dot in the middle of her forehead.
