Chapter 1521: Old Bee Tree

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

They had been too busy killing the ant king, and they hadn’t paid attention to what else was going on. They heard a noise, and they finally noticed a dome-like cave ahead of them, and an old tree inside it.

The old tree possessed a lot of fruit, but they were certainly abnormal. They looked like bees, and they were around the same size as a man’s fist.

The wings of the bee fruit were continuously flapping, generating the typical buzzing noise bees produced. They looked weird enough to make anyone feel itchy, seeing so many bees swarmed around the tree.

Han Sen didn’t know what sort of tree it was, but after using his Dongxuan Aura, he could tell it was immensely powerful. Fortunately, the bees were just fruit. They were still attached to their harboring branches, so they couldn’t attack.

While Han Sen and Wang Yuhang still marveling at their current luck, another noise suddenly sounded. One of the bee fruits twirled around and tried to strike Wang Yuhang by firing its stinger.

The stinger was too fast, and Wang Yuhang failed to dodge it in time. Fortunately, Han Sen was quick enough to react and smack the projectile down onto the ground. But even after that, Han Sen’s hand began to feel incredibly numb. His face changed.

Wang Yuhang felt much relief, but now all the bees on the tree had propped their stingers up to take aim at him. Like rain, the stingers all fired needles at Wang Yuhang.

“Oh no!” Wang Yuhang shouted. He was unable to dodge a single one, and now that they were all firing his way, he pictured himself ending up very swollen.

No matter how fast Han Sen could swing his sword, he wouldn’t be able to take down all the toxic needles, either. He summoned his Overbearing Shield to cover both of them.

Many toxic stingers struck the Overbearing Sheild, battering it with the patter of a rainstorm. They were unable to break the defense, though.

The gold word overbearing then began to glow atop the shield, ricocheting the force of the stingers back at the tree they had been fired from.

Han Sen thought firing back might allow them to damage the bee fruit or perhaps even kill a few, giving Han Sen a chance to discover what they were.

When the toxic stingers were pinged back, at about halfway in their return flight, it was suddenly as if they possessed minds of their own. They turned around in mid-air and came back for Han Sen.

But the toxic stingers didn’t come straight for them this time. Their flightpath curved to go around the shield and get Han Sen and Wang Yuhang. They were like small daggers.

The Overbearing Shield was strong, but it could only protect one side. It could not protect against stingers that came from a variety of directions. This turn of events wasn’t making Han Sen happy, so he picked up Wang Yuhang and decided to run.

Fortunately, the toxic stingers couldn’t fly very far. When Han Sen had run the distance of a mile, the stingers flew back and returned to the tails of the bee fruit.

“What are those things? They can reattach their stingers?” Han Sen looked back at the bee tree, seeming surprised.

“A whole tree full of bees. That’s disgusting! Let’s run,” Wang Yuhang said.

“Stop. The old tree might be decent. The toxic stingers are quite strong and likely super in class, but perhaps the bee fruits are super creatures. If we kill them, that is a lot of Life Geno Essences for us to harvest. And we’re sure to get a beast soul with those odds,” Han Sen said.

“No way. How can one tree possess so many super creatures? Are they that cheap now?” Wang Yuhang struggled to believe him.

“It’s worth giving it a shot. What if I’m right?” Han Sen didn’t want to leave, but he hadn’t yet thought of a way in which he might kill the bee fruit.

Their toxic stingers were too small, and they had a distant operational range. Furthermore, the Overbearing Shield would be incapable of blocking them all. Han Sen didn’t want to risk getting stung, so he paced back and forth for a while thinking. He still couldn’t come up with a firm solution.

“If those bees are all super creatures, this’ll be hard. Perhaps we should go back and make a plan.” Wang Yuhang seemed to be afraid of bees.

Han Sen looked around and noticed there was only one path leading to the tree. If Han Sen had to retreat, it’d be difficult to make use of the exact same path again.

“Fine, let’s go back. We’ll return when we come up with a solution.” Han Sen then took Wang Yuhang back to Mask Shelter.

Ling Mei’er, seeing them both return safely, was very happy. She thought Han Sen and Wang Yuhang might have been unable to survive the wrath of the ant king.

When Han Sen retired to his room, he had the time to inspect the Bloodthirsty Ant beast soul.

Super Beast Soul Bloodthirsty Ant King: Glyph-Type

Han Sen already knew about the ant king’s beast soul type, so he summoned it out. The tattoo of a red ant king appeared on his body, and when it did, a strange heat surged into him. With this intense warmth, it soon began to feel as if his blood was boiling. His strength and speed had definitely increased.

Han Sen, feeling this power inside him, was quite pleased.

When Han Sen used the God geno core, his power reached that of a super demi-god. But that was only because he used the red light from the God geno core and the abilities granted by the butterfly wings.

Han Sen’s strength was still stuck at the tier of a gemstone-class creature, but the ant king glyph increased his power and speed. Now he really was very close to super.

“Not bad. This is actually pretty nice. I suppose it was worth my time and effort.” Han Sen was really fond of the ant king’s beast soul.

The ant king was strong, but it didn’t help him with a plan for killing the Old Bee Tree. He couldn’t just run up to the tree and kill all the bees.

“It’d be great if I had a super armor. If I did, I could totally block the stingers and kill the bees. It’s a shame that pet armor can only be used on a pet. Unfortunately, I don’t have any strong pets. If Meowth went up to the old tree, it’s unlikely it’d be able to damage the Old Tree Fruit. I need to find a super pet,” Han Sen thought to himself.

It was a shame Han Sen had been unable to get one of those so far. Unless Little Angel evolved, his super pet armor would be useless.

“Little Angel, come out soon.” Han Sen missed the time he had spent with Little Angel in the past.

“Dad, I miss Littleflower. Shouldn’t we go and visit Little Brother?” Bao’er asked. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Okay, let’s go and find Littleflower.” Han Sen took Bao’er to a teleporter to leave.

Han Sen was living with the Ji family, currently. When Han Sen came out on the other side of the teleporter, he raised his head. Someone was coming his way. When Han Sen saw the person, he realized it was Ji Qing.
