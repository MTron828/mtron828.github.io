1798 Crystal Geno Weapon

“Of course I have heard about them. Is that scabbard related to the crystallizers?” Han Sen’s heart jumped, but he held his emotions in check and kept his voice flat.

“If you know, then why do you ask?” Yisha replied icily.

“I have heard about this race, but I do not know much about them. Please explain it to me, but please be aware: if I am bored, I may do something unpredictable.” Han Sen smiled as he fondled the horn arrow.

Yisha hated Han Sen, but she clamped down on her anger and said, “The crystallizers were a new race of the geno universe. They were here for a short amount of time, and their evolution process was fairly average. In fact, it was worse than some of the lesser races. But the crystallizers were wonderful with geno technology. They created a crystal geno weapon that could enable normal geno fighters to battle against Dukes, Marquis, and even Kings.”

“Something that strong resides here?” Han Sen was shocked. He thought the crystallizers had been unable to become strong, and had thus been destroyed. But with her saying this now, he was learning that while their bodies were not strong, their weapons did not seem weak.

Yisha ignored Han Sen and continued to speak. “After the crystallizers created their crystal geno weapons, they grew in strength. They were ambitious, and they even sought to claim a position in the geno hall. But their strongest leader was merely a Duke. He wasn’t even a King class fighter. No race with such limited power had ever tried to challenge a position in the geno hall before.”

“But they failed. It seems like the crystallizers’ crystal geno weapons were inferior to those of Kings.” Han Sen could predict how it all ended.

Yisha looked at him with disdain, and said, “Shut up if you don’t know anything. The crystallizers’ crystal geno weapons were as good as the Kings. If they challenged ordinary higher races, they might have indeed lit up a lantern. But they were too strong, and they invented a geno weapon that was greater than the gods. And with that geno weapon, they challenged a most mighty higher race. And the God elites of this higher race destroyed them. They disappeared shortly after.”

Han Sen was shocked. He hadn’t known the crystallizers were that great, and so it came as a surprise.

“Could this scabbard be the crystal geno weapon that is able to slay a god?” Han Sen looked at the scabbard in the lake and became very excited.

Yisha said, “You think it’s here? You think such a thing would still reside in a place like this?”

“Who knows? Maybe no one knows.” Han Sen smiled.

Yisha said, “You think too much. Power doesn’t just appear as if out of nowhere. And the crystallizers were only able to craft a single one of those crystal geno weapons. And yet they still failed. They weren’t able to kill a god; not even a deified elite. The crystal geno weapon was reduced to dust Many races saw that happen, so a lot of them know. But after a while, the memory of the crystallizers has faded. Many cannot recall anything about them.”

“What is this scabbard, then?” Han Sen blinked.

“It’s an ordinary variant of those crystal geno weapons. If it was complete, then it might carry one in a fight versus Duke class foes. Perhaps even King class. Now all that remains is the scabbard, and so its strength is decreased,” Yisha said.

Han Sen didn’t believe her, as he knew very little about her. But with her battle skills, it was clear to see that she was not an ordinary person from a higher race. She could be a Duke or King herself. A character like her would not enter a place like this in search of an incomplete crystal geno weapon.

Han Sen stared at the scabbard and said, “Two elites once fought here. They fought over a treasure. That is why this xenogeneic space has such strange suppressive properties. Might this be the item they were fighting over?”

“Your imagination is quite something,” Yisha said coldly.

Han Sen wanted to squeeze more information out of her, but the lake suddenly moved. The scabbard flew towards them like an arrow. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yisha immediately became happy, as no more talking could follow. So, she reached out to grab the scabbard as it flew.

She had only been talking to keep Han Sen occupied and calm. He hadn’t done anything to disrupt the scabbard, just like she planned. And now that it was flying forward, she could happily ignore Han Sen. As soon as she grabbed the scabbard, her work would be finished, and she could kill Han Sen. He would be her first kill with it

The scabbard flew to the forehead of the statue, fitting itself neatly into a slot that Han Sen had noticed there.

Han Sen originally thought that slot was something of a decoration. It might even have represented a third eye. But now he knew it was not anything like that; it was instead a slot for the scabbard. Han Sen had no idea why the scabbard would be drawn to the slot

Han Sen thought about it quickly, and he saw Yisha on the adjacent shoulder. She was reaching out to catch the scabbard. Han Sen threw a punch, aiming towards Yisha’s hands.

Yisha looked murderous, and she swung her sword. Luckily, Han Sen was able to dodge it. If he hadn’t, he’d have lost his hand.

Han Sen’s other fist came into contact with Yisha’s other hand, though. There was a pang sound, and both of them flinched backward. Neither of the two caught the scabbard.

The scabbard flew past the pair, fitting itself neatly into the slot on the forehead of the statue. There wasn’t a single seam, and it fit inside perfectly.

“How dare you!” Yisha looked extremely glum, and she couldn’t stand his presence anymore.

“Whoever sees it gets to share. I should have half of it, right?” Han Sen smiled.

“Do you think I can’t kill you?” Yisha lifted her knife and looked at Han Sen. Her body was suddenly blazing with a purple fire. Anger was definitely the fuel.

“I thought Demon Grave suppressed powers, and not even Kings could overcome that. So, what is this?” Han Sen’s face changed. This was bad.
