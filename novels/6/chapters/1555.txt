Chapter 1556: Godslayer Shelter

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The leader of those humans seemed to be Iron Fist Jia Shidao.

When Han Sen joined the Demigod Association, he had come into conflict with Jia Shidao, and it ended pretty badly.

“I can’t believe I’m so unlucky. I’ve finally run into some humans, yet I’m at odds with one of them. Why do I keep running into people I don’t want to see?” Han Sen thought.

Jia Shidao was powerful. He had an iron fist glove on his right hand, which seemed to be his geno core. Each strike from that fist left a scar across the scales of that mutant creature.

As for his companions, they were relatively weak. They weren’t strong enough to break the creature’s scales. When they hit the mutant creature with their blades, they were basically just scratching its back.

That mutant creature looked bizarre. Its body looked like a turtle’s, but it didn’t have a shell; instead, it was covered by thick scales.

Jia Shidao seemed to have a gemstone geno core, and when his glove hit the creature, it slashed the scales half a foot deep. Each impact left behind visible flesh and seeping blood.

That mutant creature was attacking the humans savagely, damaging the formation that Jia Shidao and the others were trying to maintain. The creature was relatively slow, so it wasn’t a deadly threat, but it looked ferocious.

“Hi all, need some help?” Han Sen moved closer to them, bringing Little Silver and the others with him, but he didn’t help them immediately.

The fight was still ongoing. He didn’t get along with Jia Shidao well, so if he made a move, they might think that he was trying to steal their kill.

“Please do, my friend!” Jia Shidao and the others were overjoyed. They were having a hard time fighting the mutant creature as they couldn’t injure it severely, and they were quickly becoming exhausted. They might not even survive the battle. It would be great if someone could help them now.

Yet Jia Shidao was dazed when he turned his head and saw Han Sen.

After getting a confirmation, Han Sen didn’t hesitate. He immediately summoned his Split-Blade geno core. He moved his body and instantly arrived beside the mutant creature, cutting through it.

The mutant creature and its thick scales were sliced in half like a piece of tofu.

Jia Shidao and the others were shocked. They stared at the dead mutant creature.

That mutant creature was called Chou Shell Beast, and it had powerful defenses, even among the sacred-blood creatures. Yet Han Sen had cut the creature in half with a single strike. Even Jia Shidao was stunned by that.

“Sacred-blood creature Chou Shell Beast killed. Beast soul gained. Geno core unobtained. Eat the flesh to gain zero to ten sacred geno points randomly.”

Han Sen hadn’t expected to get the beast soul, which thrilled him.

Slashing Blade was a super geno core, and it was one of the most destructive super geno cores. It could kill a sacred-blood creature easily, and it was a happy surprise for him to get a sacred-blood beast soul as well.

“It’s been a long time, Mr. Jia,” said Han Sen, looking at Jia Shidao.

Jia Shidao forced a smile and said, “It has indeed been a long time, brother Han. Your power has improved so much. It was so easy for you to kill a Chou Shell Beast. You must be at the super level already.”

“It’s not that easy to get super genes. My sacred geno points are just maxed already, and I was lucky enough to get a highly destructive geno core,” said Han Sen, smiling.

Others also went up to Han Sen and talked to him. They were all experienced demigods, and Han Sen had heard of them all. However, other than Jia Shidao, Han Sen hadn’t met any of them.

They were more joyful after realizing that Han Sen didn’t want the flesh and blood of the Chou Shell Beast. They relaxed, and they answered all the questions Han Sen had in detail.

Han Sen wasn’t amused to find out where he was now.

There was a human shelter nearby, which was where Jia Shidao and the others all lived. It was one of the few top-tier shelters owned by humans.

However, Han Sen didn’t want to see the owner of that shelter.

Though many more humans had become demigods over the last decade, Luo Haitang still stood far above the rest. The shelter Jia Shidao and his friends were staying at was known as Godslayer Shelter, and it was ruled by Luo Haitang.

Han Sen was a little hesitant about the idea of entering Godslayer Shelter. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

It wasn’t entirely Luo Haitang’s fault that Han Sen’s mom left the Luo family, so Han Sen didn’t have any specific animosity toward Luo Haitang for that. However, Luo Haitang had tricked Han Yan into practicing the Falsified-Sky Sutra, which deeply upset Han Sen, so he had a very bad impression of Luo Haitang and his family.

If Luo Haitang ran into trouble, the Luo family would ask Han Yan, who was just a girl, to fulfill their family oath. That oath was a promise passed from generation to generation, and it required one of their family members to fight a shura every ten years. It was a family curse, which was forced upon Han Yan by Luo Haitang, which was the main reason why Han Sen had a grudge against Luo Haitang and his family.

“Han Sen, your great-grandfather Mr. Luo is in the shelter now. Do you want us to take you to see him?” asked Liu Che, one of the demigods.

Han Sen hesitated, but he shook his head and said, “No need. I still have something else to do.”

Finishing that, Han Sen planned to leave. He now had some idea of where he was, so it would be easy for him to get back to God’s Ruin.

The fairy was still in God’s Ruin, and Han Sen needed to go back and take his share of the profits from the Godlight Tunnel. He planned to get back to God’s Ruin and check if Jade, the Little Lion King, and the fairy were still there.

Jia Shidao hesitated, then called to Han Sen, “Brother Han, please hold on for a minute.”

“What else do you want?” Han Sen asked, stopping and looking at Jia Shidao.

Jia Shidao clenched his teeth, forced another smile, and said, “Brother Han, I have some business to discuss with you. Are you interested?”

“What business?” Han Sen looked at Jia Shidao, confused.

“It’s about killing a super creature. I’ve found some opportunities that we can kill super creatures, but I’m not strong enough to break their bodies. However, with the power of your geno core, you might have a chance,” said Jia Shidao.

“What’s a super sacred creature?” Han Sen was interested.

He was definitely interested in killing some super creatures to get their life geno essences. Han Sen had only gained control of one life geno essence, which belonged to that dog; as for the others, he hadn’t had time to absorb them.

“It’s kind of complicated. Let’s go back to the shelter where we can talk. I can guarantee that you’ll be interested in it,” said Jia Shidao.
