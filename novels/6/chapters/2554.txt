Chapter 2555: One Arrow Shocks Ten Thousand Races

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Han Sen drew Wind String, and the predatory roar coming from the bow grew ever louder. Nearby Kings felt their hearts pounding in their chests. They felt as if their hearts were going to explode.

As everyone drowned in this shock, they knew they had to leave the area and watch Han Sen from a greater distance.

Autumn Wind started to look grim. Sweat trickled down his forehead. Han Sen was going to pull the bowstring back as far as possible. If he fired it now, Autumn Wind was genuinely unsure whether or not he could dodge the arrow.

Wind String, at full strength, could harm a deified. Autumn Wind was only half-deified. Even though it was his bow, he didn’t think he could avoid an arrow fired by it.

Kat!

When Wind String’s bowstring reached the halfway point, Han Sen felt as if something had gotten stuck. He couldn’t pull the string further or let it go. As this occurred, a tornado-like substance chain was released by the bow. It became a scary space tornado that pulled Han Sen into it.

“Oh, no! Oh, no! Wind String is going to consume him.”

“Bad luck for Han Sen. Why did he have to borrow that cursed Wind String?”

“Will Wind String cut off Han Sen’s head?”

“It is hard to say. Many people have been decapitated by Wind String.”

Sweat ran down Autumn Wind’s forehead. If Han Sen fired that arrow, he didn’t think he could dodge it.

As all the Kings discussed this, the tornado surrounding Wind String suddenly disappeared. And Han Sen was still at the center of the storm. He was holding the bow, with its bowstring moving again as he drew it further back. He hadn’t been hurt by Wind String.

Wind String kept groaning in his hands. It looked as if it didn’t want to be there, but it had no choice but to submit to its new wielder. And as a result, it groaned.

“When I, Han Sen, want to fire an arrow, you have to open up no matter what,” Han Sen proclaimed. Then he applied a massive amount of strength from his fingers. The bowstring that wasn’t fully drawn was suddenly pulled all the way. It was now as far as it could go. It looked like a full moon.

Wind String shivered and shook, releasing an angry roar. But its protests did nothing. It couldn’t stop Han Sen from firing an arrow.

Everyone was shocked. Han Sen was using Wind String by force. Even its powers of consumption didn’t prevent its new wielder from using it. Seeing Wind String now was like watching a woman with a man forcing himself on top of her.

Han Sen trained an arrow on Autumn Wind. Autumn Wind’s face went grey. The sweat pouring from him had started to soak his clothes.

Seeing that Han Sen on the cusp of firing an arrow, Autumn Wind finally shouted, “No! Don’t shoot! I know that you can.”

Han Sen ignored his plight. It had been so hard to pull the string of that bow; after all that work, he was definitely going to fire it.

Whoosh!

When Han Sen released the bowstring, it broke the fabric of space. The arrow flew out, disappearing from everyone’s vision.

Autumn Wind became a typhoon. He kept shifting position like a wind that no one could catch.

But somehow, that feather arrow still appeared in front of him. It was going to shoot right through his forehead. Autumn Wind was a dead man.

Just as the feather arrow was about to puncture Autumn Wind’s forehead, the arrow suddenly abandoned its target. It shot away from everyone, heading toward a nearby planet instead.

Pang!

The arrow perforated the entire planet, and a second later, the planet exploded. The shockwave washed over several other planets, and the Kings around them were knocked off-balance by the shockwaves.

Fortunately, they were far away from the planet. Otherwise, the explosion would have hurt them a lot.

Autumn Wind’s face looked pale. If that arrow had hit him, his body would have been annihilated. He would have been unable to escape. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Even when he used Wind String, he couldn’t summon that much power from the bow. After all, he wasn’t deified. He couldn’t use the full potential of Wind String.

“Thank you for not killing me, Mr. Han.” Autumn Wind bowed to Han Sen.

“Do I need to demonstrate with another arrow?” Han Sen asked, looking at Autumn Wind.

“There is no need. I lost. I will keep my promise and pull the rickshaw on your behalf. It will be an honor to do this,” Autumn Wind said.

Han Sen returned Wind String and its quiver to Autumn Wind. The bow’s master was Autumn Wind. Han Sen could use it, but he needed the soul robe, Jadeskin, and the power of the Dongxuan Sutra to do so. Firing that one arrow had tired him out more than an entire fight could. No matter how good the bow was, it wouldn’t be easy for Han Sen to use.

Plus, Han Sen had only said that he wanted to borrow it. He always planned to return it.

Autumn Wind accepted the bow and returned it to his back. He walked in front of the bronze rickshaw and stood next to Ji Yang Sheng. He pulled the rope and said, “Mr. Ji, now that we are coworkers, it is nice to meet you.”

“F*ck that. Look after your own *ss,” Ji Yang Sheng hissed furiously. He was thinking about why elites like themselves had to operate a rickshaw. And he wondered why Autumn Wind showed so much enthusiasm for the lowly task.

When people saw Ji Yang Sheng and Autumn Wind pulling the bronze rickshaw, they finally shook off their daze.

“God’s Daddy really deserves his title. He is too much of a f*cking god. How could he force Wind String to submit to him without ending up dead? Is he really a King? Are you sure he isn’t a deified in disguise?”

“Nonsense! Deifieds can’t enter the core area.”

“Yeah, right. But when he used the bow, I think he generated a substance chain.”

“That feather robe must be a powerful deified treasure. That has to be how he was granted such a scary amount of power.”

“No wonder the Extreme King can’t capture him. He is way too strong.”

There were some Extreme King princes and princesses there, but none of them opted to attack Han Sen. No one was willing to try to stop him. His performance with Wind String was so scary that it had stunned everyone.

In the core area, not even the Extreme King wanted to confront him. Unless they could bring deifieds to bear against him, Han Sen’s power was simply overwhelming.

All the races researched the video of Han Sen firing his arrow. The widely-accepted explanation was that the feather robe was a mysterious treasure that helped him. It could some allow Han Sen’s power to rival a deified.

“That *sshole! How does he have so much good luck? First, he earned the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze, and now he has that mysterious feather robe. How many treasures does he have?” The Sixth Uncle of the Extreme King saw the footage and moaned.

“It looks like we cannot capture him in the core area. We must find him in the systems of chaos,” the Fourth Uncle Meng Lie said in a hard voice.

“Spring Rain has been looking for him. I hope they will return bearing results.” The Sixth Uncle didn’t harbor much hope for Spring Rain’s success, though.

All the races now understood one thing: Han Sen shouldn’t be provoked in the core area.
