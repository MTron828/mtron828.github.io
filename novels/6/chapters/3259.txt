Chapter 3260 Tester Comes to Attack

“Mister Leader, I have already gone to have a look,” Bury Path God said while bowing politely to the old tower. “The level-17 life soul over Chu Yuan was killed by Han Sen. His life soul is gone too.”

“It was him. Now it makes sense.” Qin Xiu’s voice came out from the old tower.

“Mister Leader, do you want this person to be erased from this world?” Bury Path God lowered his head to speak.

“Let No. 19 go. Let us see what this test shall prove.” Qin Xiu’s voice did not waver in the slightest. “Yes, Mister.” Bury Path God looked weird as he walked away.

“Mister, what is Qin Xiu doing? While we are in the 33 skies, why has he been hiding? Why does he not come out?” In a secret place, Bury Path God spoke to a few of his men.

“I think there is a problem with his body. Otherwise, why else would he require someone else? Perhaps this is our chance. While his body has a problem, we can kill him and take back control of the God Chaos Party.”

“We cannot rush this. Right now, there is no denying Qin Xiu is very scary. There is a 100% chance he will strike again. Otherwise, there will be a disaster in front of us.”

“If we do not take risks, how else are we supposed to get things done? If we miss out on this opportunity and Qin Xiu can fix the problems in his body, our chances of escape will be even slimmer.”

All these creatures had been arguing. In the end, they took their gaze away from Bury Path God.

Bury Path God coldly said, “Qin Xiu’s body must have a problem. Before we find out what the issue is, we should not do anything rash. He now has these life souls. That means he is giving us a chance. If the life soul test works, and we own them, there is no longer a need for us to be afraid of Qin Xiu.” “Are you saying that the information regarding life soul cores is in Qin Xiu’s hands?” an elder who did not understand asked. “We are only in charge of looking for test subjects and observing their progress. How are we supposed to own them for ourselves?” “I have a plan for dealing with this little conundrum.” Bury Path God looked at Rocky Dee and said, “Rocky Dee. You must find a way to bring test subject No. 19 to Han Sen and see what kind of powers No. 19 wields.” “Yes, My Master,” Rocky Dee said with a graceful bow.

Han Sen and Bao’er were sitting on a sofa watching cartoons. Suddenly, something moved inside Bao’er’s pocket. She took it out of her pocket and opened it. A man made of paper instantly leaped out of it.

“Han Sen, can you be honest with me and not try to attract trouble?” It was Rocky Dee’s paper man that jumped out. He did so while angrily shouting at Han Sen. “What did I do now?” Han Sen was eating popcorn while watching an animated movie. He responded to Rocky Dee casually.

Rocky Dee madly asked, “What? Did you not just recently slay Chu Yuan?”

“Yes.” Han Sen asked in shock, “Was Chu Yuan a member of the God Chaos Party too?”

“He is not a member of the God Chaos Party,” Rocky Dee coldly said. “He was merely a test subject.” “What sort of test subject?” Han Sen asked with genuine curiosity. Rocky Dee hesitated to confess it, but he quietly said, “After Qin Xiu became the leader of the God Chaos Party, he started conducting tests. He gave an item that was called a life soul to a few specific creatures. After the creatures adopted these life souls, they were able to feel the reverse world powers. With that, they were able to use the life souls to break the world. In a short amount of time, he was able to produce many Break World elites.”

“Is such a thing possible? What exactly is a life soul?” Han Sen recalled the weird gene race on Chu Yuan’s left arm.

“I don’t know, but I will admit that it looked rather like a gene egg. It was a bit different from a gene egg though. Every gene egg must have a special creature to hatch it. Other creatures cannot hatch them at all. So, including these test subjects, no one can know what these life souls are. Even the test subjects who receive a life soul and the God Chaos Party members in charge of observing them have no idea what the life souls are.”

After Rocky Dee said that, he looked at Han Sen. “Chu Yuan was the 17th test subject. Why did you go and kill him? If you want to die, that’s totally fine. Just don’t drag Master Bao’er down with you. It is not as if you know the breadth of Qin Xiu’s power. In the past, if Bao’er’s identity was discovered by Bury Path God, you would have been permitted to live. If she were found by Qin Xiu, you would be very dead.” Han Sen did not bother listening to Rocky Dee’s complaints. He was too busy trying to figure out what a life soul was. Those things were a bit like gene races and, in a way, a bit like beast souls. They had both of their features.

“What is Qin Xiu thinking?” Han Sen did not understand the man’s thought process. He did not know why Qin Xiu was attempting so many things.

If this was for Wan’er, she would have already been revived. What else could he possibly need?

Han Sen looked at Rocky Dee and asked, “You said Chu Yuan was the 17th test subject, right? That means there are 16 before that. Who are they?”

“I don’t know,” Rocky Dee said. “The God Chaos Party has already been split in two. One party is determined to follow Qin Xiu. The other party wants to destroy Qin Xiu. The life souls Qin Xiu got were given out to everybody. I only know where a few of them were handed out to. From what I have best been able to tell, the success rate of the life souls has been high. Six of the life souls resulted in three of the given test subjects breaking the world. The other three went crazy and died. The success rate is 50%.”

“Fifty? That is pretty scary.” Han Sen knew how scary 50% was. They were Break World elites. They were similar to a Break World elite in the Qin Kingdom but stronger. Some weak kingdoms only had two or three Break World elites.

If people like Qin Xiu were able to casually produce Break World elites, there was no doubt the world was going to come to an end. “I do not think Qin Xiu has too many of those life souls,” Rocky Dee coldly said. “All this time, he has only had 19 of these life souls. He recently issued a command that demands the owner of the 19th life soul owner to come out here to try and kill you. You watch yourself, okay? Do not allow Master Bao’er to get involved with all of this.”

“Who is the master of the 19th life soul?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.

“Zhao Kingdom’s No. 1 singer, Zhao Ning’er. She will be in the Qin Kingdom, so you better watch it,” After Rocky Dee spoke, the paper man looked as if it lost its soul and fell onto the table.

“Zhao Ning’er?” Han Sen had heard that name before.

He did not focus on Zhao Ning’er. Since he lived in Feng Fei Fei’s house, he kept hearing news about Zhao Ning’er. Many people compared Zhao Ning’er to the three singers of the Qin Kingdom. Most people thought Zhao Ning’er was better than the three singers of the Qin Kingdom. They thought she was the future singing queen and would likely be the greatest singer to ever live after the Singing King Zhong Li Qing.

For a person like that to end up as Qin Xiu’s test subject, it suggested life souls were something highly coveted by humans. Even Chu Yuan and Zhao Ning’er, people who were already famous, could not resist.

Han Sen frowned as he thought, “Weird. Why is Qin Xiu looking for test subjects that are young people?”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
