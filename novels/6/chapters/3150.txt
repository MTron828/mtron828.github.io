Chapter 3151 My Fate Is Entwined with This Child

Han Sen thought the child looked just like Burning Lamp. He calculated the time from when Burning Lamp died to what the age of that child was now and thought it was a perfect match.

“It is a shame for this alpha, Burning Lamp, to reborn into such circumstances.” Han Sen sighed.

Back then, Burning Lamp was able to flip the clouds into rain. He once turned Han Sen into an ant. How powerful was that? It was a shame he might not be able to grow up and live the life of an adult in this life.

Han Sen knew that if the little boy was Burning Lamp in his afterlife, past grudges meant nothing. The afterlife was just one’s spirit. None of Burning Lamp’s persona or memories carried over to define him.

In this world, one just had to picture a sheet of paper with lots of text and symbols scrawled on it. Although it contained meaning, if that paper was recycled to remove the text and drawings on the paper, it was just a new sheet of paper.

“I wonder what Burning Lamp’s talents are in this life.” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He looked at Decapitation Queen in her sub hall. Decapitation Queen immediately said, “I understand.”

The woman outside was holding her child and pleading for a chance, but the men were determined to kill the child. The man in the center said, “Woman, do not take it out on us for being cruel.”

After that, they moved to kill the child. The woman had some power, but she had been running for too long. She was like a lantern that had burned through all its oil. She was no longer able to fight her pursuers. “Please, someone save my child! If my child can live, I will gladly die!” The woman held her child as her eyes brimmed with desperation and sadness.

Seeing the knives about to fall, a “katcha” noise sounded. The heads of the aggressors were suddenly lopped off. Blood soared through the air as their headless bodies slowly crumpled to the ground.

The woman’s eyes opened wide. She watched what happened in frightened awe. She then saw a giant, bloody guillotine floating in the air. Behind the guillotine was a queen-like doll pulling a cord.

The woman was shocked. She looked at Decapitation Queen in horror. Her first impulse was to put her child behind her.

Whoever saw Decapitation Queen would not have believed her to be a God Spirit sent to save them. She was like a scary gene race that could consume all life.

“If you want your child to live, come with me.” Decapitation Queen pulled the guillotine toward the God of Wealth River.

The woman’s face kept changing, but she was determined. For her child’s security, she would live no matter what.

The woman was still like a lamp that had run out of oil. Now, she was following Decapitation Queen. She had totally used her will to go. Her body was wobbly, so she stumbled a lot. If there had been no will to protect her child, she would not have been able to walk at all.

She finally walked to the bank of the river where the God of Wealth Temple resided. Decapitation Queen pointed at the river. “There is a god temple 10,000 miles deep. If you can take your child there, your child will be protected by a God Spirit. He will inherit a Blood-Pulse. In this world, no one will be permitted to kill him. If you do not want to go, you are free to leave.”

After that, Decapitation Queen pulled the guillotine into the river and disappeared.

The woman knew her body was not going to last. She would have to rest for a long time before getting her power back. If she swam down with the current state of her body, there was an 80% to 90% chance she would perish.

She looked at the child in her arms. The woman’s eyes flashed. She stroked the child’s cheek. The woman looked to be in the throes of profound sadness as she said, “My child has had a hard life. Even if he escapes today, you and I will still probably die alone. If you can really give my child a Blood-Pulse, I would swim through a river of fire and knives to see him receive it. I hope the God Spirit will let my child live.”

After that, the woman kissed the child on his forehead. She picked him up and went into the river.

The God of Wealth River was not normal. The woman dived in. She summoned an injured gene race to protect her child so her son would not drown and die.

The woman only had that one injured gene race left, and she used to protect the child. She would just have to dive in on her own.

In this world, the fitness level of humans was very bad. This woman’s fitness level was not too bad. She was able to dive a thousand miles deep, but it was now becoming a struggle.

The woman gnashed her teeth and dived deeper. She felt powerless. Although she gritted her teeth and tried her best, she wanted her own will to push her down deeper and reach the god temple.

Some things did not work because of fate’s intervention. The woman’s body could not hold on. She opened her mouth to breathe, but the water went in. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The woman knew it was going to be bad, but she had no other choice. She looked at the child and put all of her power into the child. She wanted to call out his name, but when she tried, water went into her mouth.

The heavily injured gene race was controlled by the woman. It was bid to swim down deep into the river. The woman could only watch her child sink into the dark of the river’s depths while her vision started to fade.

Han Sen watched this happen from his God of Wealth Temple and sighed. In the end, the woman decided to give her life up for the child.

“Decapitation Queen,” Han Sen summoned. Decapitation Queen understood what Han Sen wanted. She nodded and left the god temple.

Just as the woman’s will was going to be snuffed out, a blood-dyed rope came up from the depths of the water. It wrapped her body and pulled her deeper into the river.

The woman was shocked, and her consciousness came back a bit. She saw a light. Deep in the river, a god temple was shining with gold.

The river water around was kept at bay by the god temple. It enabled a large vacuum zone for it to exist. The rope came at her from the god temple. Decapitation Queen held the other end.

Decapitation Queen held the child in her other hand.

“Cough, cough. My name is Du Ru Lan. Thank you for saving me... I do not know how to pay you back.” The woman fell in front of the god temple’s plaza. She got up as she started coughing at Decapitation Queen.

“Come with me,” Decapitation Queen coldly said. She held her child and entered the god temple’s main hall.

Du Ru Lan saw the god temple’s plaque read, “God of Wealth Temple.” She was shocked. Decapitation Queen looked strange, but she was a god of wealth. It surprised her.

When she walked into the god temple, she noticed Decapitation Queen wasn’t the actual God of Wealth. There was a god statue at the god altar that looked very powerful.

Decapitation Queen did not dare stare at the god statue. She kneeled before the god statue and said, “Mister, I brought them.”

Du Ru Lan now knew that Decapitation Queen, who looked like a god and a ghost, was just a subordinate of the temple’s true master. She kneeled to the God Spirit with Decapitation Queen and thanked it for saving her. “My fate is entwined with this child,” God of Wealth said. “Will you allow him to join me?”
