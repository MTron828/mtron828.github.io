Chapter 1559: Jade Shura Is Jade Shura

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Han Sen thought, “Then you’re just playing us! You’re the renowned Godslayer Luo, and you’re my great-grandfather.”

Han Sen didn’t say that out loud; after all, the old man was one of Han Sen’s seniors.

Before Han Sen said anything, Luo Haitang continued, “Though I don’t want to admit it, the truth is that the Jade Shura, who have much more Shura blood, are much better at practicing the Falsified-Sky Sutra. In order to win against the Jade Shura, I have to resort to some special methods, which quickly burns away my life. No matter how hard I try, I won’t last another five years. I don’t have a choice, so I have to find someone to take over my position.”

After pausing for a short while, Luo Haitang said, “I’m not saying this to make you empathize with me. I’m just telling you exactly what’s happening, and I want you to know that it’s true for Han Yan too. If you really care about her, you should help her win the battle she’s going to engage in six years from now.”

“I’ve told you, that I won’t let Han Yan fight for your family. That’s not her destiny.” Though Han Sen was surprised that Luo Haitang might actually die in the near future, he wasn’t willing to compromise on the issue of Han Yan.

Luo Haitang looked at Han Sen as if he were looking at a spoiled brat. He smiled and asked, “Then what are you planning to do?”

“They want the Falsified-Sky Sutra, right? I’ll just give it to them,” said Han Sen.

Luo Haitang shook his head mildly. “Even if you gave it to them, the Jade Shura wouldn’t let you go easily. Do you really think they’ll allow someone else to know the Falsified-Sky Sutra? Even if you give it to them, they’ll also try to kill Han Yan. Even those who have been exposed to the Falsified-Sky Sutra, like your mother, might be hunted down.”

“Then I’ll kill them all,” said Han Sen.

Luo Haitang stopped defending himself. Instead, he said, “Don’t you think the term ‘Jade Shura’ sounds a bit familiar?”

“What do you mean?” Han Sen asked, confused.

Luo Haitang shook his head and continued, “The empress of the Shura race is named Jade Shura. Do you think this is only a coincidence?”

“The Shura Empress is the Jade Shura of this generation?” Han Sen looked dazed. Though he also thought it was weird that the names of these two were so similar, he hadn’t expected the Shura Empress to be a descendent of the Jade Shura.

The Shura had a much stronger emphasis on bloodline than humans, and Jade Shura had been a human. He procreated with the Shura race at first, but afterward his descendants procreated with humans, so the Jade Shura only had a tiny portion of shura genes. It was shocking to Han Sen that one of them could actually become an empress of the Shura.

Luo Haitang nodded. “The empress is the descendent of Jade Shura in this generation, and she’s the most powerful descendent. Though she’s only practiced half the Falsified-Sky Sutra, I could barely win against her in the last battle, and her power is still growing. Even if, against all odds, I’m still alive in five years, there’s a good chance that I might be defeated by her.”

Luo Haitang took out a chip and a journal, giving them to Han Sen. “This is the record of the battles between me and the Jade Shura, and some of the techniques I developed that go with the Falsified-Sky Sutra. I hope you can give them to Little Yan. She must win the battle in six years. If she loses, not only my family will be d*mned, but the entire Alliance will be as well. I can’t imagine the power of a Jade Shura who had practiced the entire Falsified-Sky Sutra.”

Han Sen didn’t take the chip or the journal. He said calmly, “Han Yan is my sister, so I’ll be the one who teaches her. You don’t need to worry about it. I’ll say it one last time; don’t go disturb my sister. I’ll kill anyone who does, whether that’s you or the Jade Shura.”

Han Sen prepared to leave.

“Young man, you’re being too stubborn. You’re behaving just like Lan Er, rebellious and unwilling to listen to others’ opinions,” said Luo Haitang. “Have you ever thought that your recklessness might cost Little Yan’s life, and even your mother’s?”

Luo Haitang saw that Han Sen still didn’t want to listen. He sighed. “If I had any other options, I wouldn’t have chosen you guys. Even if my family is destroyed, you guys can still live happily and peacefully, but the fact is, Lan Er has also practiced the Falsified-Sky Sutra. Even if the Luo’s are annihilated, Jade Shura won’t let her go easily. You were born in the wrong family, so whether I force you or not, the Jade Shura will come for you sooner or later.”

“Just take it, son. This is the hope of my family, and also the hope of your family.” Luo Haitang gave Han Sen the chip and the journal.

Han Sen looked at Luo Haitang. The legendary Godslayer Luo seemed like a dying old man. Though he didn’t look old from the outside, he was indeed old inside.

Out of nowhere, Han Sen felt pity for Luo Haitang. He sighed. “What did you do? Why do you only have five years left to live? You still look pretty spry to me, and you don’t seem to have any internal injuries.”

Luo Haitang said, “My potential in the Luo family is definitely at pinnacle level, but compared to those from the Jade Shura, my Falsified-Sky Sutra is weak. The blood of the Shura determines much of the power of the Falsified-Sky Sutra, and to win over the Jade Shura, I resorted to something that no human being has ever tried before. I practiced ‘Shura Change’ as a mere human being.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The Shura genes in my family are almost negligible, and with that tiny remaining bloodline, I started to practice ‘Shura Change’ as a human being. Luckily, the benefits were beyond my imagination. My power was much greater than that of ordinary human beings after that.”

Luo Haitang looked kind of smug. “That power combined with the Falsified-Sky Sutra made me invincible in the shelter, but at the same time, I lost the ability to gain power from the shelter. I can use the flesh of creatures to strength my own body, but I can’t manipulate spirit genes like you do or gain their powers. The only thing I can use is the power of my body and power of Falsified Sky, but those two combined are enough for me to fight the most powerful creatures. There are only a few humans or creatures that can actually rival me.”

“However, that kind of power has also over-exploited my body. You can feel that I have much more energy than other human beings. I’m like a balloon that has been blown too big. Though it looks sturdy, it might explode at any time. I’m trying to suppress the power, but it’s still surging. In five years, or even three to four years, I won’t be able to suppress the power anymore,” said Luo Haitang.
