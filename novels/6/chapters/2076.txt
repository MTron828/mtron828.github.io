2077 Palm

Back on Planet Eclipse, Han Sen opened the box and found a small data card inside. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Han Sen plugged it into a computer so he could view whatever info was stored on it. He quickly found that all the files were on a skill titled Moonlight. The files explained that Moon Wheel, which Han Sen had already learned, was actually a part of Moonlight. Moon Wheel King had written the explanations himself, and he referenced all sorts of skills and experiences as he went.

Up until now, Han Sen had not been able to modify Moon Wheel because he had only been able to learn the skill in its most basic form. He had the soft technique named Moon down pat, so this information was very valuable to him. It was especially helpful to hear about Moon Wheel King’s own experiences and techniques.

It was a priceless gift he had received. This wasn’t something one could simply buy.

The final part of the teachings was when Moon Wheel King explained Moon. This was even more meaningful to Han Sen.

“This is a lofty gift to receive from Moon Wheel King.” Han Sen knew that a gift like this wasn’t something Rebecca and her sister could give to whoever they wanted. Moon Wheel King had approved this himself.

For the next two days, Han Sen remained on Planet Eclipse. Bao’er should have been returned two days ago, but Yisha said she had grown fond of Bao’er and wanted her to stay in the palace for a few more days.

Han Sen did not know if Yisha really liked Bao’er, or if she had actually uncovered something about her. Regardless, there was no use in worrying about it. He’d just wait for her to return home.

When Shadow King came back, Narrow Moon became the focus of many headlines. Shadow King, Night River King, Black Moon King, Moon Wheel King, and Knife Queen had recently explored an ancient high race ruin. The expedition had been extremely profitable.

During the excavation, an important item was unearthed. They brought it back with them, and for the month leading up to its unveiling, excitement swelled throughout Narrow Moon.

The ruins had been the home of an ancient deified being. There were many precious items inside, including a powerful geno art.

But that race was different from the Rebate, so the geno art was sent to Narrow Moon’s equivalent of Sky Path Garden for research.

The item they brought back was a giant metal wall. The Rebate professor guessed that the ancient deified elite had practiced his geno art against the wall, using it like a punching bag.

It sounded like a simple tool, but any wall that could withstand deified powers without breaking was remarkable. It was composed of a very rare material, and the Rebate regarded it as quite the treasure.

There were many palm prints denting it, which they believed was the result of a geno art used against it. It was a scary geno art, and the palm prints still had a residue of the deified elite’s will. Many Narrow Moon students went to see it, and many of them learned something from it.

Han Sen had nothing to do on Planet Eclipse except eat Marquise genes. He practiced a few geno arts, but he was growing restless and bored. If Knife Queen hadn’t wanted to keep Bao’er in her palace, he would have already taken her to Sky Palace. Han Sen was eager to return to capturing the Jade Spirits in the White Jade Jing.

Han Sen brought Little Angel, Han Meng’er, and Zero with him to see the metal wall. When they arrived, Han Sen knew why the Rebate had not hidden its existence.

Unlike the small wall that Han Sen had envisioned, it was a blue metal cube nearly one thousand meters long. When he stood beside it, the block seemed the size of a mountain. Hiding it in a building would have been difficult.

There were many palm prints all across the blue metal cube. Some were shallow, whereas others were deep. Each palm print had five fingers, like a human’s, but they were much bigger. Han Sen could lie down in one without bumping his head.

“This is a giant’s relic, right?” Han Sen said, while examining the handprints.

“Probably. This item was discovered in ruins belonging to the Ligu. Judging from their bones, they were one hundred meters tall.” Rebecca approached, with Du Lishe and the others behind her.

Sad Night was there, too. He looked at Han Sen with contempt.

“I see.” Han Sen nodded. He looked at the prints, feeling a strange sensation as he did.

As he examined the palm prints, he got the impression that any of those strikes could have annihilated a galaxy. Even looking at the aftermath was shocking. It was like an endless number of stars had been broken by a hand, and the whole galaxy destroyed.

“Deified Ligu were very powerful. I don’t know how long the blue metal cube has existed, but the will put into those palms is quite shocking,” Han Sen praised.

“Han Sen, if you have found something, why don’t you share it so we can learn?” Du Lishe asked with a blink.

Han Sen shook his head. “I haven’t studied the prints. I feel the meaning behind them, but nothing more.”

After Han Sen said that, a cold voice spoke. “Han Sen, you are too humble. Geniuses like you only require one look. You have had a few.”

Han Sen glanced over at the speaker, and he saw that it was Night River King’s son, Sad Night. He was not surprised.

Sad Night had been beaten by Xi Qing King, so it was likely that the young man still hated Han Sen and Xie Qing King. Han Sen didn’t care for the man’s insults, though.

“I am stupid. I cannot see anything. If you see something, perhaps it is you who should be telling us?” Han Sen said with a smile.

This was exactly what Sad Night wanted. He looked happy for a moment, before suddenly looking cold again. He said, “I took a brief look, too. I have some opinions to share that can get you guys started.”

Rebecca and the others looked at him with surprise. Sad Night was talented and very bright. But they still did not believe he could be better than Han Sen. There was no way he could see what Han Sen could not, especially from such a brief look.

Sad Night could see that the others were wary, which just made him even less happy. This was his first time seeing the prints, just as it was for the others. He did have knowledge about them, but it wasn’t something he had learned all by himself. However, as long as he could embarrass Han Sen, the source did not matter.
