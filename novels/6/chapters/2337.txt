Chapter 2338 Bai Qing Xia’s Words

“Ah, so opening the king body can attract the Kingese. I thought this was something special,” Han Sen thought to himself.

As he mulled this over, one leaf suddenly stood out among the galaxy of shining Kingese. The Kingese upon it was shining brighter than the sun.

Before Han Sen had even started focusing, the Kingese left the leaf and went straight for Bai Qing Xia.

Among the people that were watching the sight from afar, someone started screaming in excitement. “It moved! The Kingese moved! What is that word?”

Many of the royal children looked over to see what the voice was talking about. The Kingese that was shining like a sun seemed to be transparent and natural in its form. It was like looking at a beautifully polished piece of jade.

“Fan!” Bai Ling Shuang read the word out loud.

“Fan, or pretty gem... Even the king tree things Prince Seventeen is pretty like a gem. He is a shiny thing himself, and so that is why Fan came down for him,” Bang Canglang said coolly.

The word Fan was shining, and it landed on Bai Qing Xia’s forehead. It melted into his flesh like a snowflake touching water.

When that Kingese symbol blended into the man, Bai Qing Xia’s attractive body looked even shinier. His skin was like the spotless surface of a beautiful jade. Any pale spots on his body seemed to have vanished, and he looked to have been rejuvenated. He looked very handsome.

Many of the princesses were so jealous that it drove them a little crazy. They wanted the word Fan, too. They would rather have that than any of the other Kingese.

“Hmph, he is just a pretty boy,” Prince Nineteen scoffed. His eyes were betraying his true feelings, however.

“He is so pretty. He has everything.” A female guard sighed at the sight. She couldn’t peel her eyes away from Bai Qing Xia’s face.

When Fan was totally blended into Bai Qing Xia’s body, another king leaf erupted with a bountiful light. The second symbol flew down, headed for Bai Qing Xia’s forehead once more.

Han Sen looked at the Kingese. The Kingese was shining, but it wasn’t very bright. It was very small, and it would likely bring comfort and calm to those trapped in a storm.

“Yin!” Han Sen had never seen the symbol before, but he could read and understand what it meant.

Bai Qing Xia saw the Yin drifting into his body. His jade-like light vanished. He looked like someone from heaven that had fallen down to earth to become nothing more than a commoner.

Looking at him more closely would lead to a very different conclusion, however. It was like there was jade hidden among piles of sand. There was a light, just waiting to emerge.

When it was truly unearthed, he would look so pretty.

“Yin is fitting for him. Bai Qing Xia remained hidden for many years, and then, he started to impress people today. He deserves to have the word Yin.” Bai Ling Shuang sighed. “It looks like we have another to compete against.”

As the hidden word settled, another Kingese symbol fell from a king leaf. The next word was like fire, and it moved fiercely along its path. It seemed like it could ignore everything in the world.

“Ao.” Han Sen read the word out.

Prince Nineteen grated out a laugh. “Sick Beauty was hidden for many years. Even when people humiliated him and made fun of him, he never said a word. He has always been little more than a turtle. Does he really deserve the word Ao? I’m beginning to doubt the tree’s infallible ability to sense the truth.”

“Ao doesn’t mean crazy. Crazy is something on the surface, whereas Ao resides in the bones. This Ao is in the bone and the heart. Bai Qing Xia has been humiliated a lot over the years, but he never gave up his desire to win. He has kept going and going up until now, so he definitely deserves Ao,” Bai Canglang said, shaking his head.

Prince Nineteen snorted. “Fan, Yin, and Ao. That isn’t bad. But that combination has no connection to the qualities of a king. It is nothing like Tian, De, Jun, Qin, or Shi. And it most certainly cannot compare with Ren, Yi, Li, Xin, Zhi, Zhong, Xiao Ti. Those three words aren’t very useful, and I highly doubt Father will approve of them.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Bai Canglang looked at Prince Nineteen, but he didn’t say anything in response. His face showed his silent disagreement.

The Ao landed atop Bai Qing Xia’s head, and it combined with his body. It changed his body, giving him more of that overbearing power.

Han Sen looked at him with much interest, and he thought to himself, “These Kingese symbols are quite powerful. They can change your genes and alter your body and senses. They can even affect your will. That’s really quite amazing. If I can get a symbol associated with fire, my proficiency with the elements of fire will be much improved. Every word would certainly be useful, and the more words the better.”

Han Sen’s next thought made him rather depressed, however. The words the king tree dropped were dependent on the king body that would receive them. Han Sen had stolen Bai Yi’s Original Water King Body. If he used that body to gain Kingese, he would probably get the element of water. And Han Sen wasn’t really interested in water. He was hoping to get Fan, or at least some word that would make him look more handsome.

But the king tree dropped what it wanted to drop. It always depended on how the king tree felt. People could do nothing to change it.

After Ao, another symbol fell down. That word was full of hatred, which Han Sen could tell before he even saw it properly. Merely feeling the hate surrounding it was enough to know that it would bear the word Hen.

Seeing this word, the royal children looked quite interested.

“Intriguing. Bai Qing Xia has hatred in his heart. Who does he hate, I wonder? Does he hate the lack of fairness or the people that used to bully him, perhaps? Or the high-class people above him?” Miss Mirror saw Hen, and she smiled. She looked very interested in that.

After the hatred of Hen, another word started to descend. It was called Shan. That was surprising. No matter what strength Bai Qing Xia was hiding, he didn’t sound anything like a strong mountain.

The Kingese symbols continued to fall, and there had been eight words already. The king tree still hadn’t stopped. More Kingese came down, falling through the leaves.

“This is the ninth word. This Bai Qing Xia is on the verge of shocking everyone.” All the princes and princesses looked on with wide eyes. No matter what that ninth word would be, it proved that Bai Qing Xia was talented.

If the ninth word was just some horrible Kingese, then it proved he was an evil individual. He couldn’t be a leader if that was the case.

After the ninth word combined with Bai Qing Xia, another king leaf lit up like a sun.

“The tenth word... There have been ten words!” Everyone was shocked. Gaining the king tree’s approval nine times was already a glorious thing, but now, Bai Qing Xia was on the verge of getting ten words. This was extremely rare to see in the Extreme King. Everyone looked at Bai Qing Xia differently now.
