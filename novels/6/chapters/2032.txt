2033 Xenogeneic Demon Dragon

Her blood spread like flower petals. Her powerful Dragon body could not hold strong against the countless wounds that were being ravaged by the Teeth power. Her body was ultimately tom apart.

Han Sen moved into a hidden passage nearby. There, he started to use his own strength to purge his body of the Evilbreaker Lance’s power. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

That power was strange. When it gathered up, it was like refined steel. If you were not strong enough, then you couldn’t break it. But if you used too much strength, then it was possible for you to harm your own body. Han Sen couldn’t get it out of himself.

Han Sen did not have much time to think, though. He used his Dongxuan Aura to analyze the Evilbreaker power infection, and then, the Evilbreaker powers appeared in Han Sen’s brain like a sequence.

The moment Dragon Thirteen died, Sharon had been able to feel it. His eyes darkened, and his scimitar raged with even greater strength. He struck the silver bug’s shield and broke its armor.

The silver glass bug squealed and started to fly away. Sharon was no longer paying attention to it, though. Immediately, he turned and went for Dragon Thirteen.

Seeing Dragon Thirteen’s exploded body, Sharon looked murderous. He clutched his scimitar and ran towards Han Sen.

Han Sen frowned. He had thought that without Dragon Thirteen, Sharon would be unable to find him. It looked as if he had been wrong, though. Sharon was coming right for him.

Han Sen did not know that Sharon had Evilbreaker powers, too. And Sharon could sense the force of the Evilbreaker Lance inside Han Sen.

Han Sen couldn’t spend much time worrying about this, though. He used Super Spank to attack the Evilbreaker Lance’s power. He tried to break the sequence structure of the affliction, and he damaged himself a little in the attempt.

Those two Evilbreaker powers crumbled into dust, though.

Sharon was already in front of the passage. He turned a murderous glare on Han Sen and said, “The pain that Thirteen suffered will be returned to you, a thousand times over.”

Then his black-light flashing scimitar came striking at Han Sen, who was still sitting.

Han Sen shouted, moved like a crane, and jumped out of the little passage. His Blood Feather Knife blocked Sharon’s black light.

Dong!

As his body was sent flying, Han Sen felt ripples of scary power from where the knife air and the light collided. He went crashing into a wall, and quite a bit of it fell down around him.

“You have combined Sky-Demon powers with Evilbreaker powers?” Han Sen gripped his chest in pain as he came staggering out of the rubble.

“You blocked my Sky-Demon power that can never miss. You are very strong.” Sharon looked even more murderous. The black light he wielded shone brighter at Han Sen.

Han Sen used a few skills, but he still couldn’t dodge Sharon’s scimitar. He could only fight back, but his power was not as great as Sharon’s. He was knocked away, and he uncontrollably heaved up blood in the air.

Sharon’s power was leagues greater than Dragon Thirteen’s. That was why he was the same as Lone Bamboo.

He possessed both Sky-Demon and Evilbreaker powers. Han Sen knew all about the Sky-Demon powers, but even so, it was very difficult to dodge.

Seeing Sharon attack, Han Sen did not hesitate to use his Dongxuan Aura. The knife and sword powers gathered across his blade. He saw the world as nothing more than a realm of sequence structures.

The scimitar came against Han Sen’s Blood Feather Knife. The powers of Super Spank could break sequence structures. And with it, he was able to shatter the black light coming for him. The scimitar Han Sen’s opponent wielded was reduced to dust.

Sharon’s face went pale, and he looked even more enraged than he had earlier. He stared at Han Sen’s knife.

Han Sen had broken the knifelight and the knife’s sequence structure, but he had still been blasted back ten meters. He hit another wall. There was still a large gulf of power separating the two.

“Good... good... It is no wonder you were able to fight Lone Bamboo. Of the Marquises, I doubt any have the ability to adequately fight you. You’re the best Earl there is, but today you meet me: Sharon.” Sharon looked right at Han Sen as he spoke.

Every word was pronounced with utter contempt, with a bubbling desire to rip Han Sen apart.

The next second, Sharon’s black light shone again. His purple horns turned black, and his body became three feet taller. His armor broke in his transformation, as his muscles bulged and became clad in scales.

The bones in his back broke and spread apart, becoming black dragon wings. The nails grew to become sharp, bladelike talons.

The strange glowing black was now covering his entire body. It was like he had been painted in a black light.

Buzz!

Sharon’s strong body disappeared from Han Sen’s vision. Han Sen did not have the time to react, and the enemy appeared in his face again. The blade-like talons pierced through his armor and flesh.

The crystal-looking blood began to come out of his body in a stream as he was sent flying. Before Han Sen landed, Sharon appeared next to him. The talons came to strike his arm.

Han Sen used his prediction abilities, combined it with Super Spank and his knife, and attacked back at Sharon’s hand.

But his vision was blurred, and Sharon disappeared once more. When he reappeared, his knee was striking Han Sen in his back. It sent Han Sen to the sky, up until he crashed into a stony ceiling. Pang!

Sharon waved his talons, and his black light continued to shatter that ceiling. It punched a hole completely through.

Sharon was in xenogeneic mode. He had the blood of the Demon and Dragon. His power was scary, and even a Duke would die under this onslaught.

Han Sen fell down across the rocks, his body soaked in blood. His armor was on the precipice of destruction. Han Sen knew there was a power gap between the two, and it wasn’t anywhere close.

The different between Han Sen and Sharon was like an ordinary Earl versus an ordinary Marquise. They were better than their levels defined them as, but the gap was still exceptionally wide.

Even with the powers of Super Spank, Han Sen couldn’t touch Sharon. He couldn’t break his sequence structure.

“I won’t have you die so easily. I will skin the flesh from your bones, and I guarantee that you will die in a far cruder and more painful manner than Thirteen did.” Sharon’s every word sounded like he was spitting a curse. He moved his body again and appeared in front of Han Sen. He was going to grab his opponent’s body.

Han Sen wasn’t even able to dodge, let alone draw his knife.

As Sharon’s sharp talons swooped down to perforate his body, a white light suddenly appeared in Han Sen’s eye.
