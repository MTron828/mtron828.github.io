Chapter 1574: There Once Was an Invincible Geno Core

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“The Destroyer Wolf at rank 139 on the super geno core leaderboard won’t be all that easy to kill,” Gu Qingcheng said.

“May I ask what your rank is on the super geno core leaderboard?” Han Sen asked, out of genuine curiosity.

“I am seventeenth,” Gu Qingcheng said carelessly.

“You’re that high? You’re seventeenth and you can’t defeat this Destroyer Wolf that is only 139?” Han Sen was surprised.

“It can’t beat me in raw strength, but it has the ability to consume space. I will be unable to catch him, and that is why I’ll need you and Nightmare,” Gu Qingcheng said.

“To me, it sounds as if all you really need is the assistance of Little Red. Why don’t you just ask him straight away? I can’t make him come.” Han Sen shook his head.

“He won’t accept my invitation, but you will be just as useful as him. You can come to help,” Gu Qingcheng said.

“Okay. And just to confirm what you told me; I will be receiving the items once it’s dead, yes?” Han Sen smiled.

“If you can truly help, sure. Would you plan on taking the loot even if you didn’t put any effort in?” Qu Qingcheng wasn’t very polite when it came to these sorts of affairs.

“We will see, but I am known to take out as much as I put in.” Han Sen did not argue and just went along with her.

He wanted to see how strong Gu Qingcheng was if she truly was ranked seventeenth on the super geno core leaderboard.

Han Sen followed Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon out of the shelter. The travel was dull for Han Sen, and he found himself bored. So, he asked, “Who is in first place on the super geno core leaderboard?”

Gu Qingcheng was equally bored. She said, “The one currently in first place is the fellow who leads Sacred. He claims to be God’s own child, but there are others who have the same might as him. The person in first place switches every now and again.”

“Why does the person in first place frequently change?” Han Sen asked, having been surprised by this.

“What’s so weird about that? There are many powerful geno cores there, of emperor class and berserk class. They’re all good at something. No one is the absolute strongest. That being said, when I first became a demi-god, I heard there was a geno core that held first place for a very long time. It hadn’t lost once. But that is the only time in history when the first place on the super geno core leaderboard seemed fixed. Nowadays, the holder of the first position changes frequently,” Gu Qingcheng said.

“What was that geno core’s name? Is it still on the leaderboard?” Han Sen asked with curiosity. You’re reading on B oxnovel.c om .Tks!

“If it was still on the leaderboard, the ranks wouldn’t keep changing. I have only heard about it through hearsay, though. When I first arrived here, it was already gone. I suppose you could say it’s more of a myth now. Its name, however, was Destiny’s Tower. I can only suppose it left for the Fifth Sanctuary alongside its master,” Gu Qingcheng said.

When Han Sen heard Gu Qingcheng say this, his heart jumped. If that stellar geno core was indeed Destiny’s Tower, it probably meant the one resting in his Sea of Soul.

“Sh*t! Destiny’s Tower is that strong?” Han Sen held onto his excitement and pretended the name didn’t ring any bells. Then, he asked, “Who was Destiny’s Tower’s master?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I don’t know, and I don’t think anyone does. It’s an old myth, and it is something I have only heard of once,” Gu Qingcheng said.

Han Sen asked a few more questions, but she didn’t know much. She said the master of Destiny’s Tower was strange. The rumors said when he first appeared on the geno core leaderboard, he did so at a low rank. Apparently, it was in the ten-thousands.

No one had seen it in the first few ranks, but all of a sudden, it managed to reach number one. No one knew whether that was a good thing or a bad thing.

Of course, this was just part of the myth. Gu Qingcheng had only heard about these events. She hadn’t witnessed them first-hand.

Han Sen retreated into thought. “Is this Destiny’s Tower the same one that’s in my Sea of Soul? If it is that good, and so was its master, why did they not go on to the Fifth Sanctuary? And who was that being in armor that resided in the black chimenea? Why was he an enemy of Destiny’s Tower’s master?”

All these questions now rattled around Han Sen’s head, but thinking he actually owned that tower now, he almost lost control and laughed his head off.

“Dad, why are you so happy?” Bao’er was in Han Sen’s arms. She looked right at him as she spoke.

“Oh, it’s just because you’re next to me. That’s why I am happy,” Han Sen quickly said. He was worried Gu Qingcheng might have gotten suspicious.

When Bao’er heard this, she was delighted. She kissed Han Sen on the cheek and said, “I am happy too, when you are around me!”

Elysian Moon couldn’t bear watching it. She balked. “Ugh, you two are so gross!”

“You’re just jealous. You could be like me, if you had a beautiful daughter, too.” Han Sen held Bao’er and laughed at her.

“Humph!” Elysian Moon turned glum and looked away.

Han Sen felt weird about that, though. He wasn’t sure what he said that might have upset her. What he said shouldn’t have peeved her as it did.

Gu Qingcheng then changed the subject. “When you see Destroyer Wolf, be careful. It can consume space, and it can also leap out at you from tears in the dimension, pouncing at you from any angle. If he slips into a space-crack, follow me.”

“That sounds annoying. How do you plan on killing it?” Han Sen frowned and asked.

Han Sen had enough power to fight super creatures, but this was a berserk super creature with space powers. It would be a hard fight. That was, unless he used his Destiny’s Tower. But that thing cost a lot of energy, and it wouldn’t be wise to show it off in public.

If others recognized it was Destiny’s Tower, and it was in the hands of a human, all the emperors and super creatures would come dogpile on him to end him.

“Maybe we should take a look first. There’s every chance we won’t get to him,” Gu Qingcheng said.

“What do you mean?” Han Sen was shocked.

“That Destroyer Wolf offended some people. For some reason, many creatures and spirits are now after him. We’re just going to try our luck and see if we can get it. We might not even be able to find it,” Gu Qingcheng said.

“Why didn’t you tell me any of this sooner?” Han Sen frowned.

Hearing her say this, Han Sen knew this task would not be as simple as he had initially assumed.
