2083 Walking Sky Road Again

Yisha saw his Xuanyuan Dragon wings and his Stone Cow’s stoneskin, and she believed Han Sen. She couldn’t think of a better explanation, so Han Sen got away with it.

He took Bao’er back with him to Planet Eclipse. Before they left, Yisha gave Bao’er many items, including many geno fluids for general use. They were pricier than the ones Han Sen had received.

“I can’t tell you how great your daughter is,” Yisha said, before they left.

Han Sen felt depressed. He was thinking his kids were far too good, and that their starting base was far superior to his own.

“It is because they have a good father.” Han Sen sighed and tidied his clothes, looking pleased with himself.

Bao’er enjoyed living there. Life in the city had been too boring for her. Han Sen brought her to the planet to kill xenogeneics, wanting to see how powerful a creature her gourd could suck up.

Han Sen found a Baron xenogeneic for her to try the gourd on. She brought out the gourd, and the creature vanished into it. Han Sen wasn’t surprised Bao’er had that power, though. If she hadn’t, all the xenogeneics he had fed her would’ve been a waste.

The next couple of tests did surprise Han Sen, however. She was able to suck up Viscounts and Earls. She struggled a little with a Marquise, but even that creature was eventually pulled into the gourd. Nothing was able to resist her. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Bao’er, if your gourd was that good, why did you not tell me earlier?” Han Sen looked at Bao’er’s gourd jovially.

You didn’t ask,” Bao’er said, sounding hurt.

“Good. Well, we’ll go to Sky Palace tomorrow so we can absorb that cocky red cloud.” Han Sen was super excited just thinking about that red cloud.

With Bao’er there, Han Sen didn’t think the cloud had a chance.

It was a shame there weren’t many Dukes in Planet Eclipse, though. They were really hard to find, so they couldn’t see if Bao’er’s gourd was capable of absorbing one of those.

The Marquise had fought the suction for a bit. Absorbing a Duke wouldn’t be too easy.

“It’s a shame I cannot bring Little Invisible to Sky Palac,” Han Sen thought. Sky Palace was a nice place, but it was strict with its laws. If it wasn’t for the Jade Spirits, he’d have preferred to remain on Planet Eclipse.

The next day, Han Sen said goodbye to Yisha and secretly brought Bao’er to Sky Palace.

“How do I use this thing?” It was a boring trip, so Han Sen spent his time examining the mutant King beast soul.

King Class Mutant Beast Soul Blue Gold Demon Bug King: bai sema

That was the first time Han Sen had ever seen such a beast soul. He researched it a bit, trying to see how he might make use of it.

After Han Sen summoned the Demon Bug King beast soul, a blue light shone around his body. He could widen the radius of the light or make it smaller. The smallest light was about the width of an eggshell, whereas the biggest it could go was with a radius of an entire kilometer.

The wider the bai sema grew, the lower its defense dropped. At its smallest, it could block the force of a King-class attack and shrug off the damage.

But the bai sema only worked on Han Sen, and it moved where he did. Power from the outside could not break it, but power on the inside could not go out, either.

“This bai sema beast soul is awesome. If I use it well enough, I could survive a fight against a King-class foe.” Han Sen really loved that Demon Bug Bai Sema beast soul.

Back in Sky Palace, Han Sen filled out the applications for Bao’er. They conducted their DNA tests on a planet away from Sky Palace. Human genes were unstable, so it was difficult to check their relationship reliably.

Han Sen and Bao’er’s geno cores were very similar. There were some differences, but it was enough to prove they were father and daughter.

Han Sen was given permission to enter Sky Palace with her, but Bao’er would have to traverse the Sky Road and then follow the Road to the Sky. Because she was still a child, however, Han Sen was allowed to accompany her. She didn’t have to go through it alone, as he had.

Han Sen held Bao’er’s hand and went to Sky Door Island. They headed for the gourd vines.

Bao’er looked at the gourd vine curiously, and the gourds upon it in particular.

Many people in Sky Palace had heard that Han Sen was bringing his daughter, and while not many came to spectate in person, a lot of people paused to watch wherever they were.

Han Sen’s genes weren’t stable, so he wasn’t a genius when it came to practice. He could not practice things quickly, but he was good at using techniques.

His techniques made him very strong, but to people that practiced, reaching the status of deified was the ultimate goal. No matter how well Han Sen performed, if he could not reach that lofty point, then the elites wouldn’t always look up to him.

Many people were interested in learning how talented Han Sen’s daughter was. They could tell her genes were not stable, either. Because there were so many unknowns, many of the elites were disappointed.

Unstable meant unpredictable. It meant something couldn’t be controlled. It was all a gamble. No one would gamble upon something that had no guarantee.

Thousand Feather Crane, the Yun sisters, First Day Buddha, and Yu Jing all came to Sky Door Island to welcome Han Sen. When Yu Shushang saw Bao’er, she smiled. “I did not expect your daughter to be so cute!”

Han Sen introduced them to Bao’er. “I will take Bao’er through Sky Road and lead her up the Road to the Sky. We will talk later.”

After that, Han Sen took Bao’er to the giant gourd vine.

Bao’er observed the gourds with profound curiosity. When Han Sen picked her up and began walking across the gourd vine, the gourds began to shake like bells in a storm.

Han Sen was shocked. He remembered when he first came there, the gourds were afraid of him. It was the same thing happening now, but it was even crazier. The gourds were shaking like made.

Now Han Sen knew why the gourds would have this reaction when he walked across the vine. It wasn’t because he was special; it was because he was associated with Bao’er. That was why the gourds reacted to him.

“Does Bao’er have something to do with this gourd vine?” Han Sen’s face looked strange, as he didn’t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing.
