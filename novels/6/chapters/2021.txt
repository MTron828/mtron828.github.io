2022 Ancient God Space

Han Sen was in a bad mood. He had been in Ancient God for half a day, and he had already walked thirty miles. He was sweating.

Under the protection of Yun Changkong, the tenth elder, Han Sen arrived in the Ancient God space. When he arrived, though, he realized that some power had entangled him. The power he felt was reminiscent of Sky Heart Lock. It was a little different, but the effects were similar. It hindered Han Sen’s movement.

Now Han Sen knew why the leader made him suffer the Sky Heart Locks. It was because he wanted him to experience what it was like to be hampered. The Sky Palace leader had planned to send Han Sen here a long time ago, that was clear.

It was only a shame that the Sky Heart Locks had not been broken yet. If they had been, the Ancient God space’s restrictions wouldn’t have been so arduous.

The Ancient God space was not as dangerous as he thought it would be, however. Aside from rocks everywhere, Han Sen walked all day without encountering a single xenogeneic.

Yun Changkong told Han Sen that his job there would be to hunt xenogeneics. The xenogeneics there were special, and their genes were fairly unique. The more he managed to retrieve, the better.

But as of yet, he hadn’t been able to find a single one. Without any to find, there weren’t any to kill.

Suddenly, Han Sen saw something move over a little rocky mountain. It was a being of some type, but upon closer inspection, the sight made Han Sen frown.

“Han Sen!” The person saw Han Sen and screamed aloud. Then they approached Han Sen.

“Why do I see you everywhere?” Han Sen said to Hai’er the Pirate. He really hadn’t wanted to see her again.

Hai’er was an Earl now. Her presence was much stronger than when he bumped into her with the Buddha.

“I should be the one asking you this. I thought Burning Lamp Alpha turned you into an ant. How did you recover?”

Hai’er looked at Han Sen curiously.

“It was just a small trick. He didn’t really do anything.” Han Sen smiled. He was not in the mood to explain things to her.

Hai’er smiled and said, “Well, since our fates repeatedly intertwine, why don’t we cooperate once more? Together we can slay the Ancient God xenogeneics.”

“No. I prefer being alone. I am meant to be alone. Whoever follows me is subject to awful luck.” Han Sen did not want her and her trouble to join him.

Hai’er grinned and said, “But this is fate! A clairvoyant told me. I connect well with loners, so that means we are meant to be together. We are partners, you know?”

“It’s okay if you want to follow, but I won’t be sharing a single xenogeneic with you.” Han Sen shrugged his shoulders.

“Ah, so you weren’t told. The Buddha sent someone to this place, too. What do you think might happen if he caught sight of you?” Hai’er was not angry, and she kept talking as she followed behind Han Sen.

“I’m not afraid of Burning Lamp Alpha, so why would I be afraid of a student? Even if I was scared, is cooperating with you supposed to make me less scared?” Han Sen said.

The Buddha sent a Marquise Buddha. He is not as strong as Seven Spirit, but he is an important person to them. However, that isn’t the thing you need to know. The most important thing is that the Buddha are cooperating with Demon. The Demons are enemies of Sky Palace, and they sent a person named Sharon. Do you have any idea how dangerous your situation is?” Hai’er said.

“Who is Sharon?” Han Sen kept on walking lackadaisically, as if he didn’t care at all.

You don’t know who Sharon is?” Hai’er asked Han Sen with shock.

Do I have to know who he is?” Han Sen lifted his lips.

Hai’er finally believed that Han Sen really didn’t know. “You are Knife Queen’s student, and you do is? Have you heard of Lone Bamboo in Sky Palace?”

“Yeah,” Han Sen said casually.

“Good. Sharon’s reputation with the Demon is similar to Lone Bamboo’s in Sky Palace. They are frequently mentioned together. He has already become a Marquise, so you are bound to know what will happen if you see him,” Hai’er said.

“People talk about me in the same capacity as Lone Bamboo, too. That means I don’t have to be afraid of that Sharon.” Han Sen laughed.

“What are you talking about? I know you. Seven Spirit almost killed you. Sharon is much better than Seven Spirit.” Hai’er looked at him with disdain.

Han Sen laughed and explained no more. Due to Sky Palace being quite private, news from the inside didn’t often spread outside. Not many outsiders knew about him and Lone Bamboo. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Even if I was afraid of Sharon, what use would bringing you along prove? Don’t tell me you have battled him before,” Han Sen said casually.

“I cannot beat him, but I know that there is a secret place in the Ancient God space. I can take you there, where we can fight xenogeneics and avoid encountering Sharon. Do you want to co-op or not? We split the xenogeneics fifty-fifty. I can help kill them, too,” Hai’er said.

“That doesn’t sound too shabby. What kind of place is it, anyway?” Han Sen had walked for so long, and despite that, he hadn’t seen a single xenogeneic. He thought he wasn’t going to fare too well.

“That place is mysterious. When the Pirates of yore came here, they stumbled upon it by pure happenstance. No one else should be able to find it without me guiding them there.” Hai’er looked all cocky.

“If it is as good as you are leading me to believe, then I guess I can cooperate with you,” Han Sen said.

“Of course! We will go right now.” Hai’er said, and then kept on walking. After they met in Holy Heaven, she understood Han Sen a bit more. She knew Han Sen was the trustable sort, and as long as he would gain some sort of benefit, he wouldn’t betray and kill her.

Plus, Hai’er had a secret defense system. She wasn’t afraid of Han Sen betraying her.

Han Sen then followed Hai’er. There were many rocks around, but that was all. There was no place for the creatures to hide, so the chance of finding creatures there was virtually nil.

Han Sen’s body was restricted by the Ancient God space’s powers. Together, the pair walked dozens of miles. They ended up sweating so much, it looked as if they had just emerged from spring water.

“Here, this is it.” Hai’er looked at her map and came to a stop near a crevice.

Han Sen examined the crevice and noted how crooked it was. Only one person could go in at a time, slipping through sideways. There were many crevices such as this in the Ancient God space, too.

Hai’er went in first, and Han Sen followed her from behind. They both moved along the crevice for a few miles, until eventually, the space they occupied began to widen.

Inside the mountains, there was a giant cave. Han Sen saw a statue made of stone just sitting there, but it was at least one hundred meters tall. In front of the statue, Han Sen and Hai’er were as small as two ants.
