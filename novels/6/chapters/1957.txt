“Why should I believe you? If I give you Galaxy Sand, what guarantee do I have that you’ll let Speechless go?” Clear Sea King was not mad, and he spoke in a level voice.

“Give me Galaxy Sand, and I will take you to her,” Han Sen said implacably.

“Until I see her, you’re not getting anything,” Clear Sea King said.

Han Sen laughed and said, “Then you should just kill me! I can tell you that Speechless is somewhere on this planet. Give me Galaxy Sand and I will take you to her. Otherwise, I won’t make any deals.”

Clear Sea King asked Han Sen, “Speechless is really still somewhere on this planet?”

Han Sen did not speak. He merely smiled.

Clear Sea King asked him a few more questions, but all Han Sen did was smile. He eventually realized Han Sen was not willing to say anything more.

Clear Sea King stopped his questioning and returned to Battle King’s lobby. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Han Sen was not in a rush, and he continued waiting where he was. He knew Battle King was going to resume a search across the whole planet—a search that would conclude with no results. Clear Sea King would come back and talk to him again.

Seven Spirit was dead now, so Speechless was the Buddha’s next hope for a deified elite. Burning Lamp Alpha greatly supported her now, so he couldn’t allow anything to happen to her.

A day later, Clear Sea King came back to Han Sen and asked him, “Speechless is still on this planet, you say?”

Yes. Give me the Galaxy Sand and I will take you to her. The trip will take less than half an hour,” Han Sen said matter- of-factly.

Clear Sea King looked at Han Sen and felt strange. A normal Viscount shouldn’t have been able to keep such calm composure in front of a hostile King.

“Why even take Speechless?” Clear Sea King asked.

“Because you have put Little Seven in your sights,” Han Sen said.

“Amitabha! That is Battle King’s business. This is none of our business,” Clear Sea King said.

“Speechless told me that you are snapping up Meka babies for the restoration of some deified weapon,” Han Sen said.

Clear Sea King frowned. This confirmed to him that Dollar had indeed taken Speechless. Aside from Clear Sea King himself, only Speechless knew about the need to fix-up a deified item. Not even Battle King knew when he was buying the Meka for.

While Clear Sea King sat in silence, Battle King’s voice rang in his ear. “If Speechless is indeed on this planet, you can agree to his demands. I will make sure he doesn’t earn a single grain of sand. Otherwise, I take full responsibility.”

Battle King knew Clear Sea King had yet to make a decision because he still suspected that Battle King had something to do with the kidnapping. So, Battle King had to show that he was innocent in all this.

He was also confident that Dollar couldn’t escape with the Galaxy Sand that had been reserved for him.

After hearing Battle King, Clear Sea King did not hesitate to say to Han Sen, “Take me to Speechless and we will conduct this trade.”

Han Sen looked at Clear Sea King and smiled. He didn’t speak, but it was obvious what he wanted.

“I will give you Galaxy Sand, but you have to promise me that Speechless is on this planet.” Clear Sea King stared at Han Sen.

“Yes, I told you. It’ll be a half-hour walk. Do you think I can walk off this planet in thirty minutes?” Han Sen smiled.

Clear Sea King looked at Han Sen for a while. He eventually placed a box on the table and opened it. There were many shining crystals inside. Each sparkled with the radiance of a diamond. They were so shiny that they were difficult to look at.

The energy surrounding the items was immediately discemable. Anyone could tell they were some good stuff.

Clear Sea King cast a gold light and broke the red chains around Han Sen. Then, the gold light surrounded Han Sen.

Han Sen could move, but the power in his body had been somewhat restricted by that gold light.

Han Sen picked up the box and counted the contents. Then, he placed it in his pocket. “The amount is correct. Let’s go. I will take you to Speechless. Oh, and yeah, give me back Little Seven.”

After that, Han Sen stood up and walked to the door.

Clear Sea King was next to him, and the guard did not stop Han Sen from leaving.

Someone sent Little Seven over. Han Sen took Little Seven back and walked out of Battle King’s house. No one stopped him, but Battle King’s people were everywhere in the surrounding radius of a hundred miles. Not even a mosquito could escape their watch.

“Let’s see how this plays out. Once you reveal the Buddha Lady, I will make you suffer.” Battle King’s expression was cruel as he stared at the camera. He couldn’t tolerate anyone committing such a misdeed on his planet. To him, Han Sen was a very dead man.

Clear Sea King walked next to Han Sen. He believed Han Sen could not escape with the box of Galaxy Sand.

Han Sen walked slowly, and he looked at the Meka all around. The shops and streets were all roadblocked, so there was no chance of him running.

“You sure you don’t want to go faster? If I don’t see Speechless in half an hour, the deal is off. Then, I will attack you.” Clear Sea King looked at Han Sen. Han Sen’s calm demeanor was starting to worry him.

Clear Sea King did not detect any significant power from him, so he did not believe Dollar could escape.

“Half an hour is enough.” Han Sen smiled and kept walking.

Han Sen was more popular than a superstar. All the cameras, weapons, and Nobles were trained on him. Even if Han Sen could fly, it was unlikely he’d escape from the planet.

The allotted time had almost passed. It had almost been half an hour. Han Sen had not even gone down a single street in that time. Battle King frowned and looked at the whole planet.

There was no other powerful King on the planet, so even Battle King wondered why Han Sen was so calm.

Half an hour went by, and Clear Sea King stopped Han Sen.

“Time is up; where is she?”

“Here.” Han Sen looked at all the Meka warriors, then back at Clear Sea King. He clicked his fingers.
