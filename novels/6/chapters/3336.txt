Chapter 3337 Purple Copper Sword

Seeing the woman run away, the little girl clutched her ice-jade jian with merriment. Then, the ice-jade jian’s icy colors started to fade away. It returned to its original black color. It was like a charred stick again.Han Sen exploded with power because he did not want to see the little girl get killed. The primary reason was that as the girl sustained damage, the little girl’s soul shivered in Han Sen’s soul.Unless Han Sen could reclaim his soul for himself, he suspected that if the little girl died, her soul would break, and a part of his soul would break too.

So far, Han Sen had yet to find a way to reclaim his soul.

Although it was possible that if the little girl died, Han Sen’s soul mark would return to him, that was just a possibility and not a guarantee. Han Sen did not want to take any unnecessary risks for the time being.

Han Sen thought, “I heard the woman say that the little girl is some kind of soldier or something. They were fighting for a position in the holy soldiers. Are the holy soldiers the leaders of Soldier Weapon Sky? If that is the case, the little girl and the woman are the holy spirits in Soldier Weapon Sky. Their fight was done to conduct and define the next leader of Soldier Weapon Sky.”

Although Han Sen could fly away, he did not choose to leave the little girl because she had a soul mark.

The little girl held Han Sen and happily said, “From now on, you are my holy soldier. Your name will be... Little Black!”

Han Sen almost coughed up blood. He had finally experienced what others felt when he gave names to things. Little Silver and the others were always depressed when he came up with names to give them.

Han Sen tried using his mind to speak with the girl, but he felt as if there was some sort of power prohibiting him and the girl from communicating. The girl was unable to feel what he was feeling.

Han Sen thought, “Damn the rules of the Soldier Weapon Sky. What does it even want from me? If the little girl selected me, why can we not even communicate?” After thinking about it some more, he started to understand why that was. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

After choosing their holy soldier, the so-called members of the soldiers would keep fighting and learning. They would soon come to learn the power of the holy soldier. It was something they had to complete by themselves. They could not be affected by the wills of others. They had to own it. That was a Soldier Weapon Sky rule. It stopped the holy soldiers from talking to their members.

“If I cannot become a human or get my soul mark back, I will just have to go along for the ride with this little girl,” Han Sen thought. He cast his Dongxuan Sutra power. He covered the little girl and took the little girl with him in flight. The pair swept up into the sky.

The little girl’s eyes opened wide as she looked at the metal jian. She shouted, “Little Black, what are you doing?”

“You are Little Black! Your whole family is black.” Han Sen felt depressed. He could not explain this to the little girl, so he just ignored her and increased the speed at which he was flying through the sky.

He did not know where Bao’er was. He did not even know if Bao’er had suffered the same fate as him and become a weapon inside the Soldier Weapon Sky. Perhaps she had already left Soldier Weapon Sky. Thus, Han Sen kept flying around, keeping his eyes peeled for anything of interest.

While he was flying, Han Sen let his Blood-Pulse Sutra power bleed into the girl to heal her.

On the other side of the Soldier Weapon Sky, the woman was still being dragged by the purple copper sword. She had been dragged a thousand miles without a single moment of rest.

The woman was very angry as she held onto the purple copper sword while yelling, “I am a soldier member! I am the future of the holy soldiers! If you become my god weapon, you have to listen to me!”

Bzzt!

The purple copper sword flew away from the woman. It floated in the air, blazing with a beautiful purple and red flame.

“If you become my god weapon, it is your destiny to obey me.” The woman looked at the purple copper sword with pride. She was not willing to stand back. She was like the main character of the sky and the ground. She firmly believed that the purple copper sword had to obey her.

Patong!

The purple copper sword moved. The sword thrust itself through the woman’s chest. Her blood came gushing out. The woman’s eyes opened wide as she peered at the purple copper sword. She did not seem to believe the purple copper sword was in her chest.

“No way! You are my holy soldier... You cannot hurt me... You cannot kill me... If I die, you die...”

The woman had not finished her words as the purple copper sword moved to puncture her heart. It went in and came out through her back. The woman was out of breath. She fell to the floor.

The purple copper sword floated in the air. The woman’s body had purple copper armor. It was going back to the purple copper sword. Even her life soul had been killed and become a spirit light that entered the purple copper sword.

The purple copper sword took the light and spirit light. The sword’s body underwent strange changes to become a purple and long-haired mysterious woman. If Han Sen was there, he would have screamed. That was because the purple woman looked just like Zero. She was just more mature. Zero looked younger.

This was obviously Demon Alpha Asura. If Han Sen was there, he would not believe the purple copper sword that had a bad mouth was Demon Alpha.

“I was going to let you live, but you threatened me, Asura. That was practically a death wish.” Asura did not look at the woman’s body. She regarded it as trash.

Asura looked to where she had been flying. She looked strange as she spoke to herself. “What was that metal jian? My body is the best in the universe, but my sword self could not block the metal jian. That metal jian must be very powerful. So, who was it?”

“What a shame this b*tch turned out to be such a dumbass who did not even know how to wield my power. She only used force to strike things. If she hadn’t, it would not have been difficult to kill that little girl. The 33 skies have only just recovered. Every sky is creating spirits. The little girl’s spirit is fairly impressive, so maybe she will be what is needed to kill all my opponents and become the holy soldier leader in the Soldier Weapon Sky. If she had pulled me out of the stone instead, with my power, she would have surely ascended to the throne. That asshole just had to ruin things.” Asura looked sad.

She thought of the metal jian Han Sen had become. Asura started to look very angry.

If it was not for Han Sen’s behavior, she would have likely been collected by the little girl. Instead, she was pulled out by the stupid woman.

“Do not let me find you. Otherwise, you will be very scared.” If she was to ever encounter Han Sen again, Asura had hatched a sordid thought that would ensure he would be the one to suffer great sadness.

Asura did not think she was any weaker than the metal jian. Her body was a bit weak, but her body being weak did not prove anything.
