2034 God Spirits Glory

At that moment, Han Sen’s body wrapped itself up in a white flame. He turned into a being of light and became a transparent force of energy.

Sharon squinted against the sudden light. His hands and nails pierced through Han Sen, but he felt nothing. He couldn’t feel Han Sen’s flesh in the slightest.

Han Sen looked like a god. His Blood Feather Knife blazed down towards Sharon’s head like a beam of light. Sharon’s wings curled, and he disappeared as if he was teleporting. Han Sen’s slash missed his body.

But there was some movement in the air, and Sharon’s body appeared again. He roared, and his hands turned into talons to strike Han Sen.

The roaring Demon-Dragon was operating at maximum power, and he attacked Han Sen with a technique that never missed. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Han Sen did not plan on evading it, though. The Demon-Dragon pierced through Han Sen’s body, but it was as if he was just a hologram. The strike went through Han Sen without damaging him at all.

“Impossible! What is this power?” Sharon was shocked. It seemed like Sharon had hit Han Sen’s real body, but it hadn’t worked. His strongest strike had done nothing.

“This is the power that will kill you.” Han Sen moved in front of Sharon like a beam of light and slashed with his Blood Feather Knife.

He did not have much time. Super god spirit mode would only run for a short while, and if he could not kill Sharon in that window, he’d be very dead.

Boom!

Sharon’s dragon wings flapped, and again, he disappeared.

Han Sen’s knife had been unable to hit him. It seemed like Sharon was using a genuine teleportation ability, so there was no hidden movement to trace. But he could be followed if Han Sen’s Dongxuan Aura could track and predict the energy he was using.

“You cannot kill me,” Sharon said haughtily. “I have Demon and Dragon blood, and I have Breakspace powers. I can teleport freely as I choose, and your power does not belong to an Earl. You cannot last long in such a form. Once your power has been exhausted, you will be dead.”

“I am afraid you won’t have that chance.” Han Sen, looking like a god, waved his Blood Feather Knife. Then, a white knife light was in front of Sharon.

Sharon dodged Han Sen’s knifelight and appeared down another tunnel. He looked over to Han Sen with disdain. “I told you. You cannot kill me.”

But the next second, Sharon’s face fell. As soon as he reappeared, his body had been cut by an invisible knifelight.

There was a katcha noise. His arm was detached from his body, sending out a cascade of Demon and Dragon blood. Throughout the entire cave, knifelights shone like a spiderweb. Wherever Sharon teleported, he was hurt by the lights. They savaged him, ripping off his limbs.

“You are strong, but you selected the wrong opponent,” Han Sen said to Sharon, swooping over to slash his body.

Sharon, who had lost all his limbs, tried to teleport away. But when he finished teleporting, countless knifelights tore through his body. They sliced his body into bits, sending blood and viscera spilling everywhere.

“Mutant Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Demon Dragon: mutant xenogeneic gene found.”

Blergh! Han Sen fell to the ground. He looked like a human again, albeit one that was coughing up blood. Sharon had been as good as a Marquise could get. Without super god spirit, Han Sen would have needed to be a Marquise to fight him.

Han Sen’s super god spirit had allowed him to fight Sharon, but his body had still been pushed to the limits. And with the injuries he had sustained, there was no hope of him fighting again for some time.

Fortunately, there weren’t any other threats in the area. Any Earl could bring an end to Han Sen right now.

Han Sen forced himself to stand up. He walked over to Sharon’s shattered body and picked up a black Dragon-Demon scale. Then, he left.

There should have been two more Marquises about, as they had been following Sharon. But Han Sen did not know where they had gone. He tried to hide his presence to avoid meeting them, since he couldn’t risk having to fight them. Encountering them would likely mean death.

Han Sen tried to return to the Sanctuary, but the Ancient God space seemed to stop him from opening a portal that he could jump back through.

And of course, Han Sen’s body was too weak to teleport back.

He walked away from the battlefield, but he wasn’t able to get very far. He found a hidden cave, and in it, he settled down and focused on recovering. He ran a number of skills to try to speed up the healing process.

Luckily, Han Sen’s body was stronger than the average creature’s. Jadeskin and the Blood-Pulse Sutra made his body stronger than a Dragon’s.

If Han Sen became a Marquise, he’d be stronger than Dragon Thirteen.

“I hope those two Marquises don’t find me before I can fight them.” Han Sen knew it was useless to think about this now, though. He initiated a countdown, then cast a geno art to heal himself.

The White Tiger Marquise and the other Marquise waited outside the statue, but they saw no sign of Sharon or Dragon Thirteen. Eventually, they found the continued absence of their companions to be strange.

They knew the power of Dragon Thirteen and Sharon’s combined might. Those two could kill a Duke, if they chose to. But they had been inside the silver statue for the longest time, and there was no sign of either of them. It made the pair remaining start to worry.

The White Tiger Marquise used a sonic power to boom his voice down through the cave. No response was heard. Silence was all that followed.

“Has something happened to them?” Bloodbird Marquise sounded worried.

“I don’t think so. Han Sen is an Earl. He cannot beat both Sharon and Dragon Thirteen.” The Marquise White Tiger was worried, but he didn’t want to believe it.

“Should we go and take a look?” Bloodbird Marquise asked, with obvious hesitation.

“We should wait,” White Tiger Marquise said firmly.

If Sharon and Dragon Thirteen were safe, they would bring Han Sen out with them. If something happened to them, then it would be suicide for Bloodbird and White Tiger to go after them.

The White Tiger and Bloodbird waited outside, and the longer they waited, the more worried they became. All they wanted to do was escape.

Han Sen was still recovering his powers. He had been badly hurt, and he was very exhausted. It’d take a while for him to recover.

Suddenly, Han Sen heard something crawling across the rocks. His heart jumped. He opened his eyes and saw the silver glass bug coming towards him. It stared at Han Sen with its silver eyes.
