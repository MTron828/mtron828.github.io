Chapter 3174 Purple Mist That Comes from the East

Everyone chose to watch this fight because God of Wealth’s name had become rather outstanding in the fights. Three people from the same God Spirit had already reached the top 16. It was a magnificently rare achievement.

Plus, his opponent was to be the supremely talented young man from Wu Wei Dao Palace, Zhuo Dong Lai, whose name was already known throughout the world. Aside from the Qin Kingdom, the power of the Wu Wei Dao Palace was something that lurked in the dark fringes. To the other six kingdoms the power of the Wu Wei Dao Palace was considered the greatest in the universe.

Zhuo Dong Lai’s name instantly attracted people’s attention. It was unknown how many young men must have treated him like an idol, but it had to be a lot.

“Brother Two, who do you think will reign as victor?” Yan Dan was going to watch the battle with Yan Bei Fei.

Yan Bei Fei’s wounds had yet to recover, so he was still looking a little bit pale. He sat in front of the god temple and looked at the god screen. He looked at the screen. Without a shadow of a doubt, he immediately said, “Dollar.”

Yan Dan nodded and said nothing in return. Yan Bei Fei saw his face. He knew for a fact he was thinking differently.

“Mister Crown Prince, Zhuo Dong Lai is very powerful,” Yan Bei Fei said. “Even if I do not try my hardest and still fail to beat him, I guarantee I will be able to make him bleed. As for this person, Dollar, he makes me feel rather hopeless. Something tells me we are not on the same level.” He was afraid that if Yan Dan ended up squaring off against Dollar, he would be careless. Carelessness often proved fatal.

Yan Dan replied, “Dollar might be very strong, but one power can level down 10 times. Zhuo Dong Lai was blessed by a god, and he has the gene race given to him by the Wu Wei Dao Alpha—the purple mist holy clothes. I am afraid Dollar will not be able to gain an advantage over him with that.”

“The purple mist holy clothes are powerful, but would Zhuo Dong Lai dare to whip it out in the middle of a god fight?” Yan Bei Fei looked surprised as he spoke.

Yan Dan laughed. “Even if he did not use it, someone will let him use it.”

“Do you happen to know something you aren’t letting me know about, Mister Crown Prince?” Yan Bei Fei sensed that something was veiled within Yan Dan’s words.

Yan Dan had a sip of tea. He laughed and said, “Back in the day, when Sky Group Leader took Zhuo Dong Lai, he treated him like a son. He tried his best to teach him. He treated him like the future leader of Sky Group as he raised him. Besides his talent and personal effort, Zhuo Dong Lai has been able to achieve as much as he has mainly because of the way Sky Group Leader treated him. He was half of it.”

“What does that have to do with Zhuo Dong Lai using the purple mist holy clothes?” Yan Bei Fei asked.

Yan Dan sighed. “The saddest thing in the world is a hero getting old. When a person becomes old, they think about a lot of things. That presence of a hero will be ground away by the furious, unceasing advancements of time. By the time they are done, all they have left are favors and calculations. Sky Group Leader is very old, but he still managed to have a son in his old age. Before he died, he was able to have a son.”

Yan Bei Fei suddenly understood. “He did have a son. Of course, he hopes his son can succeed on the throne and lead Sky Group. With Zhuo Dong Lai in Sky Group, not even his son will be able to overcome Zhuo Dong Lai. So...”

Yan Dan laughed. “Because of that, the relationship between Sky Group Leader and Zhuo Dong Lai has not been too good the past two years. Even us outsiders can clearly see that. Zhuo Dong Lai and Sky Group Leader, one of those two, is going to end up hurt.”

“Does that mean if Sky Group Leader has some notion of that, Zhuo Dong Lai might use the purple mist holy clothes?” Yan Bei Fei now seemed to understand everything. While the two were talking, a shadow was rushing into the space battleground. It was the famous teenager genius, Zhuo Dong Lai.

Zhuo Dong Lai was wearing snow-white clothing. He had very long hair. It flowed like a waterfall. He had not combined with a gene race. He just sat atop a white crane. He slowly flew to the space battleground. “He is certainly scarier than he was one year ago,” Yan Bei Fei seriously said. “When I saw him last year, I was able to gauge his strength at 30%. Now, I am no longer able to calculate him. He only just turned 20, right? The Genius of the Sky, those four words, I believe are only suitable for this man, Zhuo Dong Lai.”

“So, Brother Two, who do you think will win today’s battle?” Yan Dan asked with a smile.

Yan Bei Fei hesitated a little but still said, “Dollar.”

Yan Dan looked at Yan Bei Fei with shock. “Do you really think Dollar can win against the purple mist holy clothes?” Yan Bei Fei shook his head and looked bitter. “Maybe it is because I have been traumatized, but while Zhuo Dong Lai and his purple mist holy clothes are supremely strong, they will still not be enough to overcome Dollar. He will not lose.” Yan Dan receded into deep thought. Yan Bei Fei’s heart had always been strong. He knew if Yan Bei Fei was that scared of Dollar and even had trauma, then Dollar had to be someone quite different. He was a foe who needed to be treated with great caution.

A shadow suddenly flashed into the space battleground. A blood-like flame surrounded the shadow that had entered the space. It stared at Zhuo Dong Lai, who was sitting upon the white crane from afar.

“You are finally here.” Sky King had guessed that Han Sen was Dollar a long time ago, so he was very interested in seeing what would happen during this fight. He wanted an example of Han Sen’s true power to see how strong he really was.

Rocky Dee was tuning into this fight too. He wanted to know how strong God of Wealth was, as it was supposedly backing Han Sen.

Everyone who was focused on this fight sat at the edge of their seats in giddy anticipation. They stared at the god light screen waiting for the two scary elites to start fighting.

Han Sen was looking at Zhuo Dong Lai. He started to look weird.

He had been thinking for a while about whether or not this Zhuo Dong Lai was the same Zhuo Dong Lai from the Alliance. As he looked at him, he almost wanted to forget about his guessing.

The Zhuo Dong Lai from the Alliance was old. He had a beard like a goat. He was not ugly, but he was far from what could be defined as handsome. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

This Zhuo Dong Lai had a jade face and black hair. His eyes were like ink, and his body was very long and strong. Although he was sitting, he exuded a presence that placed him far away from being a commoner.

As for his appearance, he was at least a lot more beautiful than the old man Han Sen used to know.

Zhuo Dong Lai checked out Han Sen too. He did not even look as if he had come there to fight. He seemed rather relaxed as he asked, “Aside from knife skills, what else are you

good at?”

“I know a bit about everything,” Han Sen replied. “I am a jack of all trades and master of none.”

“A bit is enough,” Zhuo Dong Lai said with a laugh. “I have recently made strides with my swordsmanship. Are you interested?”

“I know a few sword skills. I can play with you.” Han Sen looked at Zhuo Dong Lai with interest. He thought this person was intriguing “That is great. I have spent a year training with the sword, so I only know one sword skill. Will you try to combat my Purple Mist That Comes from the East?” Zhuo Dong Lai stood up and balanced atop the white crane. He put his left and middle finger together to perform the beginning of a sword skill.

Zhuo Dong Lai did not combine with a gene race, but he had purple air manifest around him. It was like a mist from the east. The purple mist gathered around his fingertips.

At this moment, the whole audience was unable to control themselves. They had to stare at the mist gathering around his fingertips. It felt like the ground, sky, and space around them had been wholly swallowed by that purple mist. Nothing else could be looked at.

In Wu Wei Dao Palace, an old man screamed, “One Dollar Sword Mind.”
