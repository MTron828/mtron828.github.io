Chapter 1520: Slaying the Ant King

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Oh no!” Spirit Twelve and Spirit Thirteen felt a chill.

Han Sen led the army of ants into the shelter, and the red-eyed ants skittered everywhere once inside. They couldn’t catch Han Sen, so they merely dined on whatever other creatures happened to be in their way. Even the buildings and constructs were broken in their rampage.

The ants were like an overflowing river, swamping the entire shelter. In moments, the ground was like a blood-red sea.

“I am going to kill you!” Spirit Twelve saw the creatures in his shelter getting eaten by the ants. They had been difficult to tame, and he clenched his jaw harder and harder.

Spirit Thirteen kept a hand on Spirit Twelve, prohibiting him from rushing in to attack Han Sen.

The raging ants were everywhere, and the ant king was there, as well. It was too dangerous to go.

Spirit Thirteen was glad that their Dark Spirit spirit stones were in Dark Spirit Shelter, that much was certain. They would probably have been killed, with all the ants that had now taken over their shelter.

Han Sen raced into the spirit hall and grabbed the spirit stone embedded in the statue. But the spirit stone did not belong to Spirit Thirteen, and he found that it simply belonged to a royal spirit. This disappointed him.

The royal spirit wasn’t willing to pledge allegiance to Han Sen, and it self-destructed. Han Sen thought the spirit might have had a connection to Spirit Twelve.

The shelter, by this point, had been turned upside down. Han Sen led the crowd of ants outside, leaving behind a shelter that was now little more than rubble.

“I’m going to kill you!” Han Sen heard someone shouting from behind.

Han Sen cared little for the voice, though, and he just continued running with the ants.

“Han Sen, what do we do? The ants won’t stop chasing us.” Wang Yuhang sounded worried.

“We’ll kill the ant king and everything will work out,” Han Sen said, as he continued running.

“How? Are you able to kill it? It looks like a super demi-god to me,” Wang Yuhang said.

“Well, we can give it a try,” Han Sen said, then drilled into another passageway.

The passageway was only one-person tall, and when Han Sen went in, the ant king followed. It broke many rocks to get through.

Han Sen saw this as his opportunity. He was going to combine Taia with the red light from his God geno core. Swiftly, he stepped towards the ant’s eyes.

The ant king’s eyes were suddenly turned into gaping holes. The creature was instantly stunned with pain, and it reeled back with a sudden desire to flee the cave.

“Little Uncle, draw it back over here. Don’t let it run off!” Han Sen quickly called. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I’m not attracting that thing!” Wang Yuhang shouted, but ultimately he couldn’t help himself. He yelled at the ant king, “Dumb ant! I thought you wanted me. Come and get me!”

The ant king had wanted to fall back, but it abandoned that desire when it heard Wang Yuhang’s voice. With a murderous look, the ant king tried to rush back in. It kept digging its way through in a bid to reach Wang Yuhang and kill him.

“Good job, Little Uncle! Continue seducing it,” Han Sen said, stepping back deeper into the cave.

“Could you use a different f*cking word?” Wang Yuhang shouted, as he continued attracting the ant king.

Han Sen kept running, too, but said, “You prefer luring? But that’s not quite right. You really are more like a pimp.”

“Sh*t! You are not educated. This is called sacrifice,” Wang Yuhang said, biting his lips.

“Yeah, sure. Sacrifice.” Han Sen just nodded.

Wang Yuhang sounded mad, and he retorted, “Just stop talking crap you idiot!”

Han Sen stopped talking and spent more effort on running.

Han Sen kept thrusting Taia into the ant king that was nipping at his heels. The ant king’s fitness wasn’t bad, and while Han Sen could damage the fiend, he found himself unable to kill it.

Every time the ant king was injured, it wanted to catch them even more. Wang Yuhang’s presence maintained its aggro.

Its steel-like body pursued them, and Han Sen stabbed it in the head many times. It continued to bleed profusely, and after an hour, it began to look weak.

It took half a day for Han Sen to finally plunge his weapon through the ant king’s head. The ant king crumpled to the ground and twitched for a while before it stopped moving.

The ant king’s face was full of holes, showing how many times Han Sen had stabbed it. It looked really bad.

“Super Creature Bloodthirsty Ant King killed. Beast soul gained. Geno core unobtained. Flesh inedible. Consume the Life Geno Essence to gain zero to ten super geno points.”

When Han Sen heard the kill announcement, he felt as satisfied as he did when he ate a lifefruit. “Hunting creatures is better. Those geno plant fruits are useless.”

Han Sen had a higher chance of obtaining a beast soul by killing creatures, and now that he had gotten another super beast soul, he was incredibly happy.

Then Han Sen felt angry again when his mind returned to opening geno fruit.

The ant king’s body began to fade away, leaving behind a crystal that was the shape of a mini ant king. Han Sen picked it up.

The crowd of ants, seeing the dead ant king, dispersed and ran off. They all gave up their pursuit.

Wang Yuhang wished to shout, but Han Sen held his mouth shut and said, “Don’t! There are too many of them. God knows how long it might take us to kill them. Getting the ant king was enough.”

“Yes, but by killing the ant king, only you were able to get a Life Geno Essence. I didn’t get anything. Kill some sacred-blood ants for me.” Wang Yuhang thought it had been unfair.

“There are loads of opportunities to kill sacred-blood creatures, so there’s no reason for us to attract so many ants at once. And as for this Life Geno Essence, half of it can be yours. If you want, I can give it to you.” Han Sen then put down the Life Geno Essence delicately.

Han Sen had other Life Geno Essences, but he had thus far been unable to absorb them. If Wang Yuhang was able to figure out a way in which it might be absorbed, there would be no harm.

Since Han Sen was able to kill super creatures now, he didn’t mind giving up one Life Geno Essence. He had also managed to get the beast soul, after all.

“Really?” Wang Yuhang looked at him in disbelief. To him, Han Sen had never been that generous.

“What do you mean by that? Just take it.” Han Sen threw the Life Geno Essence at Wang Yuhang.

Wang Yuhang was delighted. He held the Life Geno Essence like a son and said, “Yeehee! Thank you so much! Next time we kill a super creature, the Life Geno Essence will be yours.”

Han Sen wished to say something, but suddenly, a strange sound was heard. When he turned around, his face changed.
