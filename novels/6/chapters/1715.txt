1716 Xenogeneic

“This is Planet Kate. So, where can I find Feathers to collect these bones and then give them to you?” Han Sen frowned.

Old Cat lifted his lips and said, “Even if there are Feathers about, you wouldn’t stand a chance against them. If you’re looking to harvest their bones, you think too highly of yourself. The one you killed in that lab was some under-developed retard. That doesn’t even count as a Feather. That was rubbish. Do you actually think they are all like that?”

“If you knew they are that powerful, why would you ask me to kill them?” Han Sen knew his power wasn’t that high, compared to the breadth of the geno universe.

Old Cat looked at Han Sen and said, “I didn’t ask you to kill them, but you are the one who wants to go back, yes? I can’t throw my life away in the pursuit of helping you, you know.”

Han Sen didn’t reply, but the Old Cat went on to say, “You don’t have to go back, either. Even if I did help you return, what if you were simply pulled back here, anyway? Do you really think generating a geno armor will allow you to escape Big Silence system? Many Nobles have died there. Yes, even if you have a geno weapon, you can still die. You are doing good right now as you are, and following me is the best course of action and the best card you have to play.”

“Aside from the bones of Feathers, is there anything else you’ll take?” Han Sen didn’t respond to what Old Cat had just said. “Yeah. I want a Xenogeneic gene,” Old Cat swiftly answered.

“What is that?” Han Sen asked.

Old Cat brought out the jade organ he had pulled from the weird bug creature. He held it up with a flourish, as if he had pulled it out of thin air. “Look. This is a xenogeneic gene. Your bone is one, too. You will only find these on a mutated creature. Of course, the body parts can be different, as it all depends on how they were mutated. But the bottom line is the same: kill them, and then find these inside the bodies.”

“Where can I find them?” Han Sen frowned.

“Xenogeneic genes can be found inside every race.” Old Cat looked like he was smiling, but he wasn’t. “So, at this point, you’ve learned that geno armors and geno weapons are different.”

Han Sen nodded. Old Cat went on to say, “In this geno universe, creatures can generate geno armor. Some are lucky enough to be chosen, and when they generate their geno armor, they can evolve into two different things. They can create geno weapons or mutate their bodies.”

Han Sen quietly said, “That means the mutated are the same level as geno weapons, right?”

“Yes. Whether a creature is xenogeneic or has a geno weapon, it will have super gene powers. If you don’t have either of those, you can’t hurt them. You should just focus on generating a geno armor, and see if further down the line you can generate a geno weapon. Without a geno weapon, there is little you can do. And of course, there is always the possibility you end up xenogeneic. But the biggest problem is that as a xenogeneic develops, they lose sense and become hostile and murderous.” Old Cat laughed.

Han Sen didn’t ask a question about that, thinking it was pointless. Without geno armor, he wouldn’t be able to kill a xenogeneic anyway.

His biggest help right now was the Northern King Glove. That was a geno weapon, but it didn’t quite belong to him. He couldn’t use it as well as the Nobles could use their naturally developed ones.

“What do those words mean?” Han Sen pointed to the grave of Han Jinzhi.

Old Cat looked and said, “The biggest liar in the universe, Han Jinzhi.”

After reading it, Old Cat found it interesting, laughed, and said, “What an ostentatious epitaph.”

“Do you think it is a human buried here?” Han Sen asked Old Cat.

Old Cat shook his head and said, “I don’t think so. Not many people can leave the sanctuaries. I would say this is most likely a crystallizer.”

Han Sen did not believe that Both the name and the epitaph sounded like Han Jinzhi.

Han Sen could not dig up a grave, though. He wasn’t afraid of doing some excavation, but this was not the Alliance. If the people of Planet Kate found out, he’d probably be sent to jail.

And when creatures died here, they were cremated. There were only ashes, so there wouldn’t be anything to see.

Old Cat encouraged him to generate a geno armor with some haste. If he had a geno weapon, he could kill a xenogeneic.

Before Old Cat left, Han Sen asked how he might contact the cat in the future. The cat responded he’d come back himself sometime, but he left no details on how he could be found.

Han Sen kept on practicing, and he kept trying to understand more about Planet Kate and the geno universe.

Fortunately, there was an internet system. It wasn’t as good as the Alliance’s network, but it could send messages. Han Sen was able to learn some of their language, and he was soon learning quite a bit about the place.

Because the xenogeneic always wanted to kill, the universe was in some danger. And you could never tell when someone was going to become one of them. But once someone became xenogeneic, they grew much stronger. Unless Nobles came to help, people with geno armors would be shredded.

He learned that the society there had really come to admire Nobles, too. To the commoners, they were true royalty. They were protectors, in a way.

There were different classes of Nobles, too. There were Dukes, Marquises, Earls, Viscounts, and Barons. The xenogeneic had ranks, as well.

Han Sen only found these titles on the internet, and he was so far unable to learn the differences between them. But there was one thing Han Sen knew for sure. If he encountered a xenogeneic before he generated a geno armor, he’d be killed.

“It looks like I need to generate a geno armor quickly.” Han Sen worked as a grave watcher, but practiced his The Story of Genes, Dongxuan Sutra, and Blood-PUIse Sutra whenever he could. Most of his energy was exhausted on The Story of Genes, though. It was the fastest to practice with, so it would be the easiest way for him to generate a geno armor.
