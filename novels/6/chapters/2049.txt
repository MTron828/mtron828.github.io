2050 Father and Daughter That Came from Nowhere

All the shura were frozen. A human child, who was six years old at the most, could throw around a third-rank goldhorned shura fighter as if he was nothing more than a toy.

In their eyes, Bao’er was no longer a kid. She was a monster.

“Humans are that strong?” All the shura were in shock.

If a child had achieved such strength, they couldn’t imagine how strong the adults must have been.

Golot wanted to turn around and run, but Bao’er threw the gold-horned shura at him like a bowling ball. The two slammed into each other and tumbled across the floor in a spray of blood. They lay in a pile, half-dead. They couldn’t get up, and they moaned.

The other soldiers scrambled out of the restaurant, screaming all the way. It was too horrifying for them.

“If you want revenge, take it now. They can’t fight back,” Bao’er said to Wood.

But Wood and the others only looked at Bao’er strangely, and they didn’t do anything else.

Bao’er then returned to Han Sen. She took his hand before speaking to Wood again. “Don’t worry. If you guys want to, you can go to the Alliance. Just tell them my father’s name, and no one will touch you there.”

Wood and the others immediately understood that Bao’er and Han Sen were special. Wood gritted his teeth and picked up a gun. He shot Golot and the gold-horned shura in the head.

Wood handed the gun to a friend, then said to Bao’er, “I will remember this favor, and I will repay the debt, if there is ever an opportunity to do so. We will not go to the human place, though. And you should go now. You killed King Samo’s people. The king owns this planet, so you should run.”

“You guys aren’t leaving? There is no need to worry. My Dad is here, and you can live in the Alliance.” Bao’er blinked at Wood and the others.

Wood shook his head. “I believe you guys are earnest, but we are shura. We will never betray our own race. We will not defect and align with the enemy, so you guys should run.”

“What a nice soldier.” Han Sen sighed. A similar thing could happen to humans, so there was nothing there that made them inherently better than the shura.

“You guys have houses here? We are here on business for a few days. Can we live here for a while?” Han Sen smiled at Wood.

“Did you not hear what the boss just told you? Planet Sky Cloud is different, as King Samo controls it. You will be killed if you do not go,” the waitress said.

Wood waved his hand, telling her to stop talking. He asked Han Sen, “You really want to live here?”

Yeah, for no more than four days. Is such an accommodation available to us?” Han Sen smiled.

“Bell, take them someplace where they can rest,” Wood said, while looking at Han Sen.

Bell obviously wanted to say something else, but she didn’t. She obeyed Wood’s command and took them to their new room.

“Boss, why are you keeping them? You just killed King Samo’s son. Keeping them here will only get us killed,” Bell said to Wood when she returned.

Wood shook his head. “Couldn’t you tell they weren’t your average humans?”

“It doesn’t matter how strong they are; they cannot defeat King Samo and the other elites. Even if they were famous, what’s the point? They are humans,” Bell said.

“I don’t know. Let us wait and see,” Wood said.

“Wait? Are we not leaving, either?” Bell and the others stared at him with wide eyes.

“It is like you said. Planet Sky Cloud is controlled by King Samo. We don’t have the money or the connections, so where can we possibly go?” Wood continued. “Maybe staying here is how we survive.”

You mean, those two humans? They...” Bell wanted to say something, but there were noises coming from the hall. Many people were coming through.

Their faces paled, and before they could react, many guns were pointed at them. They were then led out to the lobby.

Wood saw King Samo, clad in his shura armor. If things hadn’t worked out the way they did, they might never have seen the king up close.

Pang!

The shura soldiers stepped back behind the king. King Samo’s face looked grim, and his voice was grating. “I don’t care who you are, but you will die. My son’s death will not be for nothing.”

“King Samo, you had a good son,” a voice said from deeper within the building.

When King Samo heard that voice, his face changed. His eyes opened wide, and he asked in shock, “Who are you...?”

“I know who I am, but you have forgotten who you are. Killing your own kind. Humiliating wartime veterans. Ignoring the laws of the shura. Do you really think the shura are simple property that you can own and control?” said the hard voice.

King Samo’s legs were quivering and his voice was shaky, but he still had the guts to ask, “Who are you?”

“Come in and see who I am,” the cold voice responded.

“Don’t play tricks! Come out now,” King Samo said.

“As you wish.” A woman with white clothes, a white hat, and a white mask emerged from the back of the establishment. When King Samo saw Jade Ming’er, he was so shocked that he fell to the ground.

He was the king of the planet, but he wasn’t actually shura royalty. He was only a distant relative of the Jade family. Seeing Jade Ming’er, who could one day be the queen, he was rightfully fearful.

Wood thought he must have been dreaming. King Samo was now begging before the woman, like a grandson meeting a grandad.

The woman scolded King Samo, and Samo did not say a word against her. When she released him, he was overflowing with gratitude. He appreciated the mercy, and he no longer cared about his son’s death.

The most shocking for Wood and the others was that the woman had been pouring drinks for the father and daughter. She was being treated like a maid, and it made them feel as if they were in a dream.

“Who are Bao’er and that man?” Bell asked Wood when they went to rest. The whole day had been too strange.

“Don’t talk, and don’t ask! Keep them a secret forever. We shouldn’t have come to know this,” Wood told them, with a sense of importance.

Wood wanted to know who the father and daughter were, but he knew that the more he knew, the more danger he’d be in.

Han Sen stayed in that restaurant for four days. When the fourth day passed, a shura woman with a black mask arrived.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
