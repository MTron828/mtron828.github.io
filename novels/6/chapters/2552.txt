Chapter 2553: Wind String

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Because of the videos that Kings in the core area made and distributed, many elites across the universe were able to watch what was going on there. After hearing what Elysian Moon said, many angry eyes focused on Han Sen. Countless young men wanted to beat up Han Sen to save those two pretty girls.

Of course, young men who thought that way generally didn’t have the necessary rank to visit the core area. The Kings that were watching from inside the core area didn’t move.

“Is what you said true?” Autumn Wind asked with excitement, his eyes looking bright.

“If you don’t believe me, then why are you asking me?” Elysian Moon smiled.

“I believe you, my Lady.” Autumn Wind nodded, then he turned to Han Sen. “Can you please fight me? Don’t worry; I will only beat you on behalf of the lady’s request. I won’t kill you.”

“This guy is pretty confident,” Han Sen thought, suppressing a laugh. He looked at Autumn Wind and said, “I can fight you. If you win, you see the girls. If I win, what do I earn?”

“Right,” Autumn Wind said, nodding his agreement. “What do you want?”

Han Sen was surprised. He hadn’t expected Autumn Wind to say something like that. He looked at Autumn Wind, thinking he was a funny guy.

Han Sen went silent and said, “If you lose, why don’t you pull the rickshaw just like he is?”

“Sure.” Autumn Wind didn’t even think about it before he agreed. He probably never expected that he might actually lose.

Han Sen stood up and climbed off the carriage. He stood ten meters away from Autumn Wind.

Autumn Wind looked at Han Sen and said, “Use whatever attack you want. If you can hurt me, you win.”

“Thi guy is saying crazier things than I usually do...” Han Sen thought, looking at the man. Autumn Wind had a bow on his back, and seeing it prompted Han Sen to say, “Loan me your bow. I will shoot at you a few times. If you can’t dodge my arrows, then you lose.”

“Sh*t, this guy is obscene! He must know Autumn Wind’s bow is the Aichi’s deified treasure Wind String. He wants to scam the treasure off of him.”

“Who would dare do such a thing? Does he think Autumn Wind is stupid?”

“Not many people would happily hand over a deified treasure to someone else. Even if they did, they wouldn’t hand it to an enemy.”

...

While everyone complained, Autumn Wind took the bow and quiver off his back. He threw them to Han Sen. The Kings around them stared blankly at the two.

“He really did loan it to him.”

“Sh*t! Han Sen just scored big. Run!”

“Is he really going to shoot the bow? Autumn Wind just handed it to him.”

“Go ahead. Shoot me any way you want until you are satisfied.” Autumn Wind appeared lackadaisical, and he spoke to Han Sen in a very casual manner.

Han Sen picked up the bow and quiver. He noticed that the quiver contained ten arrows. He spoke to Autumn Wind and said, “There are ten arrows. I will shoot at you ten times. If I miss them all, then I lose.”

Autumn Wind nodded and said, “Sure. If you can get one arrow to touch my body, then I lose.”

Han Sen didn’t say anything more. He just gripped Autumn Wind’s bow tightly.

The bow looked very ordinary. Its body appeared to have been constructed from old vines. It looked like a very old-fashioned longbow. The string was a half-transparent, and it was as thin as a hair. It was very tightly strung, though. Han Sen didn’t know what kind of creature’s tendon it came from.

The moment Han Sen grabbed the bow, Autumn Wind’s face looked glum. That was because when Han Sen picked up the bow, Autumn Wing could tell that he was proficient with the weapon. Han Sen was doubtless an excellent archer.

However, Autumn Wind hadn’t given Han Sen his bow because he was stupid.

In fact, Autumn Wind was very smart. There weren’t many that could make use of Wind String. It was one of the Aichi’s secret treasures, and only the blood of the Aichi could activate it.

The Wind String was a very spiritual item, and Autumn Wind had already earned its approval. Even if someone took it away from him, they wouldn’t be able to use it. Han Sen’s attempts to shoot the bow would be pointless. The weapon wouldn’t help him, and he might even end up getting hurt by it.

Autumn Wind being so polite simply because he wanted the two women to have a good impression of his character. If Han Sen used Wind String to shoot him, he wouldn’t even have to move. Han Sen would miss and end up getting hurt by Wind String himself.

When he saw how comfortable Han Sen seemed to be when he handled the bow, Autumn Wind realized that Han Sen must be very good at archery. An elite like that shouldn’t have been clueless about Wind String, though. So, it begged the question why Han Sen would request to borrow it.

Han Sen stroked the Wind String’s body. Then, he slipped two fingers around the string and tried to pull it.

As everyone observed, that silk-like, half-transparent string didn’t budge.

“Pfff!” The Kings and nobles who saw this almost spat out whatever was in their mouths.

After half a day, Han Sen was unable to move the bow’s string. There was no need for the competition. Han Sen couldn’t even fire a single arrow.

“Han Sen is too naive. Did he really think Autumn Wind was letting him the bow out of the goodness of his heart? This is the Aichi’s Wind String. Without the blood of an Aichi, it cannot be used.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Yeah. How could I forget that? That is Wind String. When the Aichi were going through their roughest period of history, their final deified passed away. They haven’t had a deified since that time. The race of the Bonas attacked the Aichi and stole Wind String from them. Then, the Bona’s king tried to show off Wind String at a party. It was given to a general who was a master with the bow. He took the bow, and the king asked him for an archery performance. But that general, despite trying all sorts of different powers, couldn’t get the bow’s string to move.”

“The king of the Bonas saw this, and he commanded another general to work with the first general. One of them held the bow while the other pulled back the string. They tried to force Wind String open. They did manage to draw Wind String, but after they drew it, the string came to life like a thunderstorm. Wind String started to move by itself, and somehow, the string cut the heads off both of the generals. Ever since then, no one who owned Wind String was able to wield it. They all ended up getting hurt by it. It was even said to bring bad luck. That was until Wind String was brought back to its rightful place. The Aichi elite who retrieved it killed many people with Wind String and eventually became deified. It brought the Aichi race back to life and relevance. As a result, Wind String’s name became very famous across the universe. But aside from the Aichi, no others dare to use the bow.”

“No wonder Autumn Wind was so quick to give the bow away. It really is the Wind String.”
