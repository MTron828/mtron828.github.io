Chapter 3344 Attacking the 33 Skies

“Little Uncle, come back as soon as you can,” Tang Zhenliu said to Wang Yuhang’s back. “We will share a drink when you and San Mu return.”Wang Yuhang did not turn around. He raised his right hand to perform an “OK” gesture and flew out of the base. He looked very determined.After he flew out of the base, as Wang Yuhang was going to break space and go to the 33 skies, he felt his legs suddenly become very heavy.

He lowered his head. It was Ling’er holding his legs. He was surprised, so he fell from the air. He screamed.

Wang Yuhang picked himself up off the ground, looked at Ling’er, and asked, “Ling’er, what are you doing?”

Ling’er opened her eyes wide as she replied, “I am coming with you to find Dad.”

“Where I am going is very dangerous,” Wang Yuhang said to Ling’er. “You cannot come with me. You have to wait here at home. I will go and fetch your unreliable Dad.”

Ling’er bent her head and said, “But you cannot beat me. If so, why can you go, but I cannot?”

Wang Yuhang opened his mouth to speak, but no words were muttered. It was like something was stuck in his throat. He felt bad.

“Little Sister, stop messing around.” Littleflower showed up and pulled Ling’er away.

Ling’er put on a face of displeasure. She filled up her mouth with air, but she stopped asking to follow after Wang Yuhang to enter the 33 skies.

Wang Yuhang waved his hands and flew into the sky. He seemed weaker than before. It was uncertain whether or not it was an illusion.

Tang Zhenliu looked at Ning Yue with worry, so he popped the question they were all thinking. “Ning Yue, do you think Little Uncle can enter the 33 skies?”

In their eyes, Ning Yue was the strongest. Not only had he been able to break the world, but his Break World rate was really high.

In the past, people always wanted to see Ning Yue enter the 33 skies. Every time he was asked to go, Ning Yue rejected their notions.

People did not understand why Ning Yue rejected them though. They thought he might be scared of going, but people that understood him knew that he was not afraid. He had a fine reason for rejecting the requests of going there.

Ning Yue looked at Wang Yuhang flying to the 33 skies and said, “I do not understand this man, Wang Yuhang.”

“What is going on? Why is Wang Yuhang going to the 33 skies?” Very High and Sky Palace had been intently watching the 33 skies. They knew who Wang Yuhang was. When they saw him appear outside the 33 skies, they immediately watched what was happening.

“Han Sen has not returned yet,” Tang Zhenliu said. “Little Uncle is going to the 33 skies to have a look.”

A Very High elder frowned and said, “Isn’t this just a load of nonsense? The 33 skies are really dangerous. Even the barrier to the 33 skies is really tough. Ordinary creatures cannot just waltz in when they please. If a creature that hasn’t been able to break the world were to touch the barrier, it would be destroyed by the barrier.”

The Very High elder spoke very spitefully, but he was only saying it for Wang Yuhang’s sake. No one blamed him for that. Tang Zhenliu said, “Little Uncle has already broken the world.”

The Very High elder was surprised by this. He looked at Tang Zhenliu and asked, “Has he really managed to break the world? How did he manage to break the world?”

Tang Zhenliu told him about Wang Yuang being possessed by a life soul. When the Very High elder heard about that, he shook his head. “He has only just been able to break the world, and he has not even combined with the life soul fully. His Break World rate will be too low. Let’s not even comment on how low his Break World rate is, but even a Break World beast that does not have a Break World rate of at least 60% will be unable to enter. Look at the Break World beasts outside the 33 skies. Why don’t you try to stop him? Now that he is going, if he gets injured, the Break World beasts of the 33 skies will benefit from his corpse. This will be a bad situation.”

“If Little Uncle is going, we will believe he knows what it takes,” Xie Qing King said.

“Do you think he has what it takes? Confidence requires power for support.” The Very High elder saw that Tang Zhenliu had faith in Wang Yuhang. He just shook their head, not caring about what they said.

They were just guests there, and that was the business of Space Garden. They should not have been too brutish in participating in the politics of that place. It was best that they did not try and push their opinions on others, but they thought Wang Yuhang attacking the 33 skies was not a good move. They did not think Wang Yuhang was going to make it back.

Everyone looked at the 33 skies, which looked like a headstone. Many Break World beasts were gathered outside the 33 skies. They could not gain access, but they did not want to leave. Some of them were there to pick up benefits. If other creatures wanted to break through the 33 skies and failed, that would be their chance to finish them off.

Wang Yuhang was now outside the 33 skies. He attracted the attention of many Break World beasts, but none were in a rush to do anything. After all, they had no idea what Wang Yuhang’s strength was like. They waited until he went to attack the 33 skies. Once he was injured, they would start attacking.

Wang Yuhang looked at the 33 skies. He raised his hand, and a big bike appeared underneath him. When his hand turned on the engine and made some engine noises, the exhaust created some sort of explosion. The lights across the dashboard lit up. The whole bike created some weird sort of light. It was like some sort of futuristic bike out of a sci-fi movie.

When Wang Yuhang moved his hands, the rockets spewed fire. The bike became a group of different lights going for the 33 skies.

Pang!

The bike struck an invisible wall. The head of the bike was shattered. Wang Yuhang started to bleed, but he did not let go of the acceleration. His eyes looked cold as he pushed on with greater speed.

The bike’s engine kept making loud noises. The rockets’ fire was extremely bright. They kept pushing the broken bike’s head against the invisible barrier. No matter how hard the bike tried, it could not go forward at all.

The Very High elder shook his head. “His Break World rate is too low. He cannot gain access to the 33 skies. He is already injured. If he does not come back now, he will become food for the Break World beasts.”

Tang Zhenliu and the others were worried about Wang Yuhang too. They trusted him, but the invisible barrier was too strong.

The engine kept moaning. The rocket was like a volcanic eruption. It kept spewing flames as Wang Yuhang’s head was given a crown. He was in his half-man and half-beast mode now.

Seeing the Break World beasts around surround him, the Very High elder sighed and said, “This is game over.”

Just like the Very High elder predicted, the Break World beasts around all started to roar. They were like wolves or tigers going to circle Wang Yuhang. They were like demons that had crawled out of hell.

The two universes had many creatures looking at the 33 skies. When they saw this, they all thought Wang Yuhang was going to die.

“These people in the geno universe are so cocky. Does this guy, with that sort of level, actually dare to try to enter the 33 skies?” The creatures in the universe of kingdoms were all mocking him. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In the next second, something unbelievable happened.

They all saw the Break World beasts, which were like demons dancing together, all leap at Wang Yuhang, who was attacking the 33 skies. They did not, however, attack Wang Yuhang. They all behaved as if they were insane. They all gathered up power to hit the invisible barrier. Like a suicide squad, they kept striking it.

Pang! Pang! Pang! Pang!

The scary Break World beasts went right past Wang Yuhang. All of them struck Wang Yuhang’s location. Blood spilled everywhere. It looked as if they were throwing their lives away to help Wang Yuhang enter the 33 skies.

Suddenly, blood was everywhere. It dyed the sky red. The people of both universes had their mouths open wide. They could not close them.
