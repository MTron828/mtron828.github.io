Chapter 2271 Taking the Silver Sycee

“No, I will figure out how to get out of this by myself,” Han Sen said coldly.

Mister White shook his head and smiled. “That is no ordinary fruit, as you should be able to feel. It has you locked in place with no hope of escape. Even the strength of the blood kirin wasn’t enough to free you.”

“You know about this thing?” Han Sen frowned.

Mister White looked at the fruit tree and said, “This tree is known as the Silver Treasure Fruit Tree. It is one of the three treasure fruit trees. It is a deified plant xenogeneic. The legends say that all three treasure fruit trees are located in the Sacred Leader’s own gardens, and those three are the only ones in existence. I cannot believe that we’re standing right in front of one of them.”

After pausing, Mister White went on to say, “The three treasure fruit trees I’ve been talking about are the Bronze Treasure Fruit Tree, the Silver Treasure Fruit Tree, and the Gold Treasure Fruit Tree. They each have their own unique powers. The only one that matters right now is this one: the Silver Treasure Fruit Tree. As you can see, it has silver sycees that are capable of suppressing one’s soul. They exert force directly on the soul, bypassing the body completely. Because your soul is being locked down, it doesn’t matter if you use every ounce of strength you possess; your body will not be able to throw off the suppression. This does not just apply to someone like you, either. And that doesn’t just apply to people of your power level, either. Even a deified being couldn’t free themselves from that suppression.”

After saying all this, Mister White smiled. “Of course, this effect only activates once the silver fruit has been touched. A deified elite would have the sense not to make physical contact with them.”

“This thing cannot be eaten?” Han Sen felt depressed. If he had known all of this sooner, he wouldn’t have gone and picked up the silver fruit with his bare hands.

“Eaten?” Mister White looked as if he was going to burst out laughing. “Unless you want your soul to be locked down forever, why would you ever think about eating one of those?”

Crime laughed, too. “You want to eat the silver fruit? I’m afraid I have to tell you that you are the only person in the entire universe who would think like that.”

“Then what do the other fruits do? The bronze and gold ones,” Han Sen asked.

Han Sen didn’t ask out of idle curiosity. If they had found the Silver Treasure Fruit Tree in this palace, then the others might be nearby.

“That doesn’t matter. What matters is that you are currently suppressed by the silver sycee. Without my help, you will be stuck here forever. The palaces here are all connected in one way or another. It is only a matter of time before Fox Queen finds you. Do you think she’ll let you leave this place alive?” Mister White chuckled. “Give me the stone plate, and we can explore this place together. I am only after one additional item. I will gladly share the rest.”

Realizing that he wouldn’t be able to pry any more information about the bronze and gold fruits out of Mister White, Han Sen had to ask, “Then what do you want?”

“I can’t tell you that. I will need first pick after we find the items. It will not be a great loss to you, and it is better than Fox Queen finding you and killing you. Isn’t that right?” Mister White said.

“If that’s your offer, then you guys can leave. There is no need for us to cooperate,” Han Sen said firmly.

Mister White frowned and said, “Do you really think Fox Queen will spare you? The Shapeshifting Foxes are known to be capricious. She might have been nice to you at one point in time, but that won’t stop her from killing you now.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“I know that, but I have my own plans. There is no need for you two to worry about it,” Han Sen replied confidently.

Crime wished to say something, but Mister White stopped him. Mister White looked at Han Sen and said, “I am good when it comes to restriction and prediction skills. I can help you avoid many risks, and I can also find the Sacred Leader’s treasure quickly. Even if you aren’t afraid of Fox Queen, being stuck here won’t do you any good. You will have no choice but to sit there and watch Fox Queen treat herself to all the spoils.”

“We can cooperate, but I must have the stone plate. I’ll offer you the same deal but in reverse. I get to choose what I want first.” Han Sen smiled.

Mister White went silent and smiled. “Okay. I will accept your terms.”

Han Sen was shocked. He didn’t expect Mister White to agree so quickly. Crime was shocked, as well, and he said, “Mister White! How could you?”

“It’s okay. Without the stone plate, we cannot access the real treasure, anyway.” Mister White waved his hand.

“If you guys wish to cooperate, can you tell me how to get rid of this silver fruit?” Han Sen asked, looking at Mister White.

“It is not difficult. The silver fruit has the power to suppress souls. If it cannot feel your soul, then its suppressing power will be lifted. I have a geno art that can seal a soul. I will need to seal your soul so that the fruit cannot feel you. If we do this, you will be free from it,” Mister White said.

“I see. The more I struggle, the harder it becomes to get out,” Han Sen realized.

“If you understand, then we should not waste any more time. We need to get to the treasure before Fox Queen does. I will use the sealing soul technique to get you out of here,” Mister White said as he began walking forward to Han Sen.

“Hang on.” Han Sen held up a hand. The blood kirin slid in front of Han Sen and presented its teeth to Mister White.

“Don’t worry; I’m not that treacherous! If I said we will cooperate, I won’t betray my own words and do something bad to you,” Mister White said.

“Mister White, you worry too much. I trust you, but I don’t actually need your help.” Han Sen suddenly stood up. He lifted his hand easily, picking up the sycee and holding it before his eyes.

Mister White and Crime looked at Han Sen in shock, finding it difficult to believe their eyes. Han Sen was ignoring the silver sycee’s soul-suppressing power completely. They found that hard to believe.

Han Sen didn’t know exactly what the silver sycee did, but learning that the fruit suppressed a person’s soul had changed things. Avoiding the soul-suppressing effects of the silver sycee was actually quite easy for Han Sen.

The Sea of Soul was different from the will of most ordinary creatures. If a creature lost their will, it would be as if they were dead. Their control over their body would be lost.

Han Sen would be effected similarly if his Sea of Soul shut down. But ordinary people only had one soul. Han Sen’s Sea of Soul, however, had many spirits and beast souls.

Han Sen reduced his soul and let a beast soul power rise to the surface. The silver sycee then suppressed the beast soul instead of Han Sen. His soul immediately became light and buoyant.

“We said half and half; are you interested in the silver sycees?” Han Sen asked casually, playing with the silver sycee as he spoke.

“I could have sealed your soul to free you, but your body would have shut down. I cannot touch the silver fruit myself.” Mister White shook his head.

“If you don’t want these, then I will take them with me,” Han Sen stated happily. He swung his knife to cut down the other seven silver fruits.

With the help of the blood kirin, he cut down the other seven sycees with ease. He pocketed all of them.

Mister White and Crime were still frowning in consternation, which made it clear that they didn’t understand how Han Sen had done what he had. They looked at each other, realizing that they were equally confused. They grew even more suspicious of Han Sen.
