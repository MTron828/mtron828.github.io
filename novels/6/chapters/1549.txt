Chapter 1550: Big Iron Chimenea

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Han Sen brought Six Paths out of the Godlight Tunnel. He examined his wounds and noticed he had been injured badly. Fortunately, the body of an emperor was strong and his life was not in any danger.

Yu Miao took Yu Xuan with her and left. She stared at Han Sen the whole time, and her look could be best described as complicated.

Right now, however, Han Sen did not have the time to kill them. And even if he did, he realized it would be pointless. If he ever hoped to kill them, he’d have to do it so they’d never come back, in a one-and-done fashion.

Jade Little Lion was already showing extreme loyalty to Han Sen. He kept on calling him boss, casually, as if he had been born to serve him.

Ever since he met Cheap Sheep, he didn’t like being called a boss, so he wanted his subordinates to refer to him as chairman, as others often did.

“Han Sen, should we leave now?” Little Fairy was in a rush to ask Han Sen.

Little Fairy did not enter the Godlight Tunnel because, according to her, she wanted to level up to super entirely by herself. And she hadn’t come to God’s Ruin for the tunnel, either. It was all about the relic.

Leveling up through the tunnel offered different benefits. It was difficult to determine which was better, and people were always of a different mind in choosing which was the best.

Han Sen brought Bao’er and the others with him. Jade Little Lion wished to follow, and so Han Sen did not decline. Having a super creature like that by his side could also prove beneficial.

Jade Little Lion told the other creatures to remain by the tunnel and protect the place. Then, he followed after Han Sen to visit another place in God’s Ruin. ( B oxnovel.c om )

Han Sen rode atop Starsea Beast’s back and sometimes brought out an item or two to play with. They were the things he brought with him from the crystallizer bedroom.

Before he entered the Godlight Tunnel earlier, he felt as if something was beckoning him. He lost that sensation when he entered the tunnel.

And he no longer felt it after coming back out, so Han Sen thought the item that had pulled his attention had to be one of the items he had brought with him. But when Han Sen looked at the items, they all looked like women’s things. There was nothing particularly special about them.

“It’s those Black Seahorses again,” Little Fairy shouted, from her position up front.

Han Sen looked to the sky. The seahorses were pulling a big chimenea, as they always did. But this time, Han Sen was surprised. The flames of the object were extinguished.

“Those Black Seahorses keep pulling that black chimenea around the ruin constantly. I wonder what they want.” Han Sen was just talking to himself.

Jade Little Lion quickly said, “My father came to this ruin himself when he was a cub. And he saw the Black Seahorses with a chimenea back then, too. He told me not to get too close to them because each one is as strong as a super demi-god creature.”

“Of course we know they are strong!” Little Fairy lifted her lips.

Han Sen looked at Jade Little Lion with surprise and said, “Wasn’t White Lion King a born-berserk super creature?”

“Many people believe he was, but that’s not actually true. He leveled up to achieve the strength he possesses.” While speaking about White Lion King, Jade Little Lion looked proud.

Han Sen nodded and did not say anything. He looked at the Black Seahorses pulling the big chimenea. The Black Seahorses eventually slid down the side of a mountain and disappeared from sight.

A period of time passed and they had yet to re-emerge.

“Let’s go see what they are doing.” Han Sen was quite interested in the chimenea. The big chimenea was too cold to approach normally, but its blue fire had now subsided. If he managed to get close enough, he might be able to catch a glimpse of what was inside. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Little Fairy thought the chimenea was the relic, so she agreed they should go and take a look.

Jade Little Lion looked hesitant, but if Han Sen was going, he knew he’d have to go with him.

( B oxnovel.c om ) The party then went towards where the chimenea had set down. The mountain wasn’t the biggest in the ruin, but it was still around ten thousand meters high.

Fortunately, there were none of those strange flowers to be wary about. They all climbed to the peak with ease, free of any danger.

When they reached the peak, they noticed that behind the mountain was another mountain and peak to climb. This mountain went up into the clouds. They could actually see the Black Seahorses pulling the chimenea up the slopes.

Han Sen and Little Fairy looked at each other, and then they followed after them.

The peak was just like a normal glacier poking its head above the clouds. They couldn’t see the Black Seahorses once they got there, though.

They spent half the day climbing into the clouds, and what they saw was quite surprising once they got through. It was a sea of clouds. There were so many clouds all about, it was like an idyllic view of heaven. Another peak poked its head from out of that cloudy ocean, too. And then, there was a giant icy ship floating in the air.

The Black Seahorses pulled the chimenea up to the highest peak, then stopped. It was like they were waiting for something.

Katcha! Katcha!

Not long after, the chains of the seahorses were opened. The eleven of them shouted happily, bobbed quickly down the hill, and then leaped down into the clouds. They were like fish having just escaped a net. They swam very happily in the sea of clouds.

Not long after, a group of Ice Seahorses approached. They were the first type of Seahorses that Han Sen’s group had caught a glimpse of back in the Frozen Forest.

The eleven of Black Seahorses bobbed over to them, obviously keen to meet with the Ice Seahorses. The bigger seahorses crossed their necks with the necks of the other seahorses, like old couples.

The smaller Ice Seahorses were around them, all swimming happily. They were like one big, happy family.

When Han Sen saw them meet that way, Bao’er looked over at the chimenea with curiosity. She jumped out of Han Sen’s arms and ran over to the peak it was sitting upon.

Han Sen was shocked. He wished to call her back, but he didn’t want to spook and possibly alert the Black Seahorses. Han Sen was curious about the big chimenea, so he followed Bao’er to that same peak.

Little Fairy and Jade Little Lion also followed from behind. They all snuck up the peak from the other side.

The Black Seahorses were tying up their necks with the necks of the other seahorses, and as a result, they were unable to spot them.

The big chimenea was not lit, and it wasn’t emitting any frosty air. Everyone went over to the peak, and Bao’er leaped atop the chimenea. Then, she stuffed her head inside the chimney. She looked around with great curiosity.

Han Sen was now right behind her, so he picked Bao’er up. He pulled her off the chimenea and then put his own head near the exhaust. He wanted to get a look inside the chimenea, too
