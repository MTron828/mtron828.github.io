Chapter 3163 It Really Is Annihilation Class

“Little Yin, you have made Little Auntie very sad.” Feng Fei Fei’s eyes were so red that tears were about to flow. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

God only knew what kind of trouble she had gone through to get a God Spirit Blood-Pulse for Feng Yin Yin. The amount of effort she must have put in could not have been described in words.

She had given up so much for Feng Yin Yin. Now, it was like someone had poured a bucket of ice over her head. It felt terrible.

If this was anyone else, it would have driven them insane. Feng Fei Fei was handling it surprisingly well.

When Feng Yin Yin saw her Auntie looking the way she was, she put out her hands and tried her best to explain. “Auntie, I am sorry. I know you have tried your hardest for me, but the God Spirit San Mu found is really good. It is better than Prophet God.”

“No matter how good it is, can it be better than Prophet God? Whatever. You have grown up now. You do not need me to watch over you anymore.” Feng Fei Fei felt very depressed. If Han Sen had not saved her life, she would have tried to kill him.

Feng Yin Yin’s eyes turned red too. She held Feng Fei Fei’s hands and tried to explain what had happened. “Auntie, don’t do this. It hurts me to see this. The God Spirit San Mu introduced is really good. It is an Annihilation God Spirit.”

“An Annihilation God Spirit? Which one? What kind of Blood-Pulse did you receive?” Feng Fei Fei could not completely stop looking out for Feng Yin Yin. When she heard Feng Yin Yin had received an Annihilation God Spirit Blood-Pulse, some glimmer of hope was regained.

Although it was not a sonic God Spirit, it was Annihilation class. That made it not too bad. It was better than just finding a random, low-class Blood-Pulse.

“It was the one San Mu mentioned earlier,” Feng Yin Yin quickly said. “It was that God of Wealth.”

When Feng Fei Fei heard about the God of Wealth again, she was immeasurably disappointed. Out of the 12 Annihilation-class main gods, there weren’t any that she knew of called God of Wealth.

“Don’t try to comfort me,” Feng Fei Fei said with a sigh. “Whatever happened, happened. I cannot help you change your Blood-Pulse. I guess staying angry is pointless.”

Feng Yin Yin sensed that Feng Fei Fei did not believe her, so she hurriedly tried to explain it to her. “Auntie, I am not lying to you. God of Wealth really is an Annihilation God Spirit. It was the main god of a god temple that blessed me. Even the sub-god of that god temple was Annihilation class.”

“You’re joking. You’re being a bit too ridiculous now, don’t you think? I told you that I wouldn’t be angry with you. But if you continue to lie, I really will get mad.” Feng Fei Fei did not believe her at all.

Out of the 12 Annihilation-class main god temples, there were sub-gods, but there were not many. Sub-gods were usually Disaster class. No God Spirit had a sub-god that was the same class as the main god.

“Auntie, I am really not lying.” Feng Yin Yin didn’t know how to explain it any better, so she just tried to be honest. “God of Wealth and its sub-god are both Annihilation God Spirits. God of Wealth gave me an inheritor Blood-Pulse.”

Feng Fei Fei froze after hearing about an inheritor Blood-Pulse. She did not believe it. An inheritor Blood-Pulse was not something just anyone was able to get. Even a Destroyed-class inheritor Blood-Pulse was rare. Many gene casters begged for it.

What Feng Yin Yin had said was too ridiculous. Feng Fei Fei could not believe it. Ordinary God Spirits only chose one family to give an inheritor Blood-Pulse. The 12 Annihilation God Spirits already had their inheritors. They were royals or leaders. It was obscenely rare to gain.

Han Sen whispered into her ear, “Yin Yin, show your God Spirit mark to Feng Fei Fei. She will believe you,”

Feng Yin Yin had been too pushy. She only recognized that now. She quickly showed her God Spirit mark off.

A sparkling coin appeared in the middle of Feng Yin Yin’s forehead. It was like a gold sun. The word “wealth” was on the coin. It was shining with a miraculous god light.

A scary God Spirit presence enveloped the entire garden. On top of that, there was the symbol of an Annihilation God Spirit mark.

“It really is Annihilation class... Little Yin... Is this really an Annihilation-class inheritor God Spirit Blood-Pulse?” Upon seeing the symbol, Feng Fei Fei was as surprised and happy.

Just as Feng Yin Yin said, she had an Annihilation-class inheritor God Spirit Blood-Pulse. This was incredibly good news. This was many times better than what Prophet God could have given her.

Prophet God was Annihilation class too, but he could only offer Feng Yin Yin a perfect Blood-Pulse. He could not give her an inheritor Blood-Pulse.

An inheritor Blood-Pulse was very important. It did not just benefit one person. The children and grandchildren would also have this honor.

Even if Feng Yin Yin received Prophet God’s perfect Blood-Pulse, it would only be good for her lifetime. Having an inheritor Blood-Pulse meant all her children and grandchildren would benefit just as much. Generations would be respected and treated like nobles. The differences were incomparable.

While Annihilation class was unexpected, even a Disaster class would have been an achievement. Even a Destroyed class inheritor Blood-Pulse would have made Feng Fei Fei give up her life for Feng Yin Yin to receive.

God Spirits did not pick their inheritors easily. Feng Yin Yin’s talents and position were very rare. Even a Destroyed-class inheritor Blood-Pulse would have been hard for her to get.

“Auntie, when have I ever lied to you?” Feng Yin Yin asked. “This God of Wealth San Mu found me really is an Annihilation God Spirit, and it gave me an inheritor Blood-Pulse. God of Wealth’s sub-god is Annihilation class too. Now, I have the buffs of two Annihilation-class authority god powers. One is wealth, and the other is death sentence.”

The mark could only reveal that it was Annihilation class. She could not properly prove if it was an inheritor Blood – Pulse. Feng Fei Fei looked at Han Sen as if she wanted his confirmation.

Han Sen nodded. Feng Fei Fei felt shocked and happy, but she still struggled to believe it.

This was a bit too against everything she knew. It was too hard to believe. Feng Fei Fei’s heart jumped. She transferred her holy phoenix to Feng Yin Yin.

Her holy phoenix was a god-class gene race. It was in ultimate mode, but Feng Yin Yin was not the one who had raised it. If Feng Yin Yin did not have an Annihilation-class inheritor Blood-Pulse when Feng Fei Fei transferred it, Feng Yin Yin would have a hard time controlling it.

“Little Yin, see if you can combine with the holy phoenix.” Feng Fei Fei was as excited as she was nervous. She really hoped what Feng Yin Yin said was real, but she was afraid of it being a lie.

Feng Yin Yin accepted the holy phoenix. She summoned the holy phoenix to combine with it.

The holy phoenix was very powerful. Under the powers of two Annihilation-class God Spirits, it did not refuse or resist. It allowed Feng Yin Yin to summon it and combine with it. It was done very simply. It was like they had already done it a million times.

Feng Yin Yin was afraid Feng Fei Fei that did not believe her. She used the holy phoenix combination skill phoenix sound. When Feng Fei Fei heard the sound and saw Feng Yin Yin use a holy sound gene combination skill, her tears kept falling.

“Auntie, what is wrong? Have I not just performed it?” Feng Yin Yin was shocked. She went to hold Feng Fei Fei.

Feng Fei Fei kneeled before Han Sen and said, “Mister Han has done so much for the Feng family. Me and Little Yin have nothing to pay you back with.”

Before she went to the floor, Han Sen reached out his hand to stop her. “Me and Yin Yin were fated to meet. I have merely helped her. This was my pleasure. Please, just don’t be mad that I made this decision.”

“I was ignorant and blamed you by mistake. You can punish me and make me do whatever you want me to do.” Feng Fei Fei blushed.
