Chapter 2095 Night Ghost Betrayal

The whole base was infested with Night Ghosts. Han Sen and Lone Bamboo were trapped. If they wanted to escape, they would have to fight and kill their way through the host of Night Ghosts.

But there were thousands of them, and there were more than a thousand Dukes. Han Sen and Lone Bamboo had only just become Marquises, and they were carrying an injured man between them. It would not be easy for the three of them to escape. Han Sen looked up at the Night Ghosts that were looking down at them like hungry tigers. Then he turned to her, emotionlessly.

“Sleepless Duke, do you know what will happen if the Night Ghosts betray Sky Palace?”

“Ha! We will go and join the Demon, anyway. Sky Palace will not be able to do anything,” Sleepless Duke snarled.

“It makes sense that Marquise Kahn is here, then. It has always been your plot to betray Sky Palace!” Han Sen looked at Kahn next, and he asked, “But I don’t understand. If you were planning to join Demon, why bother getting us involved?”

Sleepless Duke grunted and said, “That it was merely an accident. We planned to use these living creatures to turn all our warriors into Dukes. Then we’d have the strength to smash through Sky Palace’s defenses. We did not expect one to run out and rouse the attention of the Observation Department.”

“With the power you wield, you could have easily killed a wounded man.” Han Sen looked at the man who was badly wounded. Kahn and Sleepless Duke should have been able to defeat him. With the injuries he had sustained, there was no way he could have fought off so many Night Ghosts.

Sleepless Duke did not answer, but the man laughed and said, “I controlled the lives of those creatures. She wants me dead, but she doesn’t want those other creatures to die. That is why I am still alive.”

“I told you to give those creatures up! Kill him and go to the Demon. If you had listened to me, none of this would have happened,” Kahn told Sleepless Duke.

“Without these creatures, my people would not be able to become Dukes. God knows how many of our people would have been killed breaking through those defenses. I had no choice in this matter,” Sleepless Duke said.

“So, you planned all this? All for us to be the ones that killed him?” Now Han Sen knew the truth of the matter.

“Something like that. But I did not expect the two of you to come here together.” Sleepless Duke coldly went on to say, “But it does not matter now. Since it has come to this, we cannot fall back. You can all go to hell!”

After that, Sleepless Duke screamed. The horde of Night Ghosts flapped their wings like demons and came racing down to Han Sen.

Lone Bamboo let the man go, thrusting the three of them into a horrendous battle.

The power and speed of the Night Ghosts were terrifying in the dark. It was no wonder why they were good at fighting. They were high level, and they had strong wills. The Duke Night Ghosts were a serious threat.

Bao’er was sitting on Han Sen’s shoulder, observing Han Sen’s fighting with curiosity.

Instead of participating in the battle, Kahn merely watched Han Sen from afar. “Han Sen, you are a powerful being to defeat Sharon. I would have liked the opportunity to kill you myself. I did not expect you would come here. That is disappointing.”

“Disappointing? What?” Han Sen flapped his dragon wings and teleported in front of Kahn. Then, he slashed towards him.

Dong!

Kahn’s demon knife came up to block. The impact sent them both wobbling back. Neither attack did anything.

But Han Sen was immediately surrounded by Night Ghosts. It was a very dangerous position to be in.

“It is disappointing that you’ll die here today, and I will be robbed of the chance of killing you myself in a one-on-one. It is a shame whenever people like you and Lone Bamboo have to die this way.” Kahn sighed.

“In that case, you won’t be disappointed. We will fight,” Han Sen said.

“It is a shame, but I do not see how you plan on surviving. The Night Ghosts are good in the dark. It wouldn’t matter if you and Lone Bamboo had a clone army of yourselves; on Planet Night Ghost, you would still be destroyed,” Kahn said.

“Maybe not.” Han Sen teleported away from the attacks of the Night Ghosts. And then, he spoke to Sleepless Duke. “Sleepless Duke, there is still time for you to reverse this mistake. The Night Ghosts can still be allowed to live. If you continue down this path, all of the Night Ghosts in this universe will be wiped out. Do you want your daughter Li Duo and the rest of your people to die with you?”

“I would rather die than remain a prisoner. Whoever gets in the way of us becoming free will die,” Sleepless Duke shrieked. She flapped her wings and came at Han Sen.

Han Sen petrified his body and stomped the ground, unleashing a shockwave of petrification. But the Night Ghosts around him did not petrify. This shocked Han Sen.

“Do not waste your energy. The only thing that can defeat the Night Ghosts is light. Petrify won’t work on them! Their bodies aren’t made of flesh, so they won’t be petrified!” Kahn smiled. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

If the Night Ghosts weren’t so excellent, the Demons wouldn’t have spent so much time trying to recruit them.

Han Sen frowned. The Night Ghosts were harder to handle than he thought.

Things were going badly for Lone Bamboo and the injured man. They were holding on, but they couldn’t escape in their current condition. They would die the moment they became exhausted.

“Come to me!” Han Sen shouted at Lone Bamboo and the man.

Lone Bamboo heard that, and his jade sword began to shine. The Night Ghosts near Han Sen backed away.

The man exploded with blue light as he came running towards Han Sen.

Han Sen waved his Ghost Teeth Knife. The Night Ghosts that he had cut suddenly found their wounds cracking and widening.

Sleepless Duke screamed and leaped at Han Sen. Han Sen teleported away to evade her.

The three of them stood together, back-to-back, as the Night Ghosts came at them from all sides. Ghost airs were everywhere. It looked as if they had gone on a trip to hell itself.

Lone Bamboo and the man wanted to start killing their attackers in earnest, but Han Sen stopped them. A blue light came out of his body, covering the three of them.

The blue light became a giant, translucent eggshell. It encased them.

Powerful ghost airs were everywhere as countless ghost claws came against the translucent eggshell. The impacts made squeaky noises, and Han Sen could feel each blow as a sort of pressure.

But when those ghost airs broke, the translucent shield was unmoved. It did not even vibrate.
