Chapter 2339 Begging for Kingese

“Ah, how interesting.” Miss Mirror leaned closer to her mirror as the next symbol fell.

Han Sen was confused. He had thought that the king tree was giving out words that would improve Bai Qing Xia’s genes, but seeing this, there was a possibility that he had misunderstood.

When the word meaning Evil went into him, Bai Qing Xia’s body started to look evil. It completely went against his style.

“It looks like the king tree only detects what is special about Bai Qing Xia. Whether the thing hidden inside him is good or bad, the tree makes it stronger. And even flaws can be strengthened.” Han Sen now understood how the king tree distributed its words.

Seeing the word Evil appear, the royal children didn’t show much of a reaction. Many of the royal children had received the same symbol, and even so, they were able to become king. So, it didn’t matter.

After the word Evil blended into the man, the leaves of the king tree remained lit. Another Kingese symbol drifted down from the king tree. It was headed for Bai Qing Xia’s forehead once more.

Seeing that word, Bai Ling Shuang screamed and said, “Ni!”

Bai Ling Shuang wasn’t the only person having such a reaction. Even Miss Mirror, using her mirror to watch the events, stood up. Her eyes opened up wide, looking at the word Betrayal.

That word Ni didn’t have a thunderous presence or a shocking atmosphere. It barely glowed. The small light it had looked as if it would be extinguished any second.

But that word made every prince and princess scream. They weren’t shocked that Bai Qing Xia had obtained eleven Kingese; they were merely shocked by the word Betrayal. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

There were countless Kingese symbols. The number of words that descended tended to show the talent of the person obtaining them. But different Kingese symbols meant different things.

It was impossible to say which words were good and which ones were bad. But some words across history had been known to prove how great an individual was.

One such example was the word Betrayal. The second king of the Extreme King, King Wen, had received the word Betrayal.

That was the only word he received. Compared to all those other royals, he was at the bottom of the list. But King Wen beat out all the other talented royal children to become the second king of the Extreme King. He also became one of the most famous kings in their history.

Back then, there was a rare prince that managed to receive twenty-one words. But he lost to King Wen, who only had one word.

After King Wen, there were seventy more kings, and countless princes and princesses. But no one else had received the word Betrayal.

Right now, Bai Qing Xia had received the word Betrayal, which shook the royal children. That word made it clear that Bai Qing Xia was indeed a very special person. This was in addition to the ten words he had received before.

Everyone was so shocked. Their mouths were opened wide, looking at Bai Qing Xia in utter shock. They couldn’t even speak.

“He was so quiet at one point, but now he is suddenly shocking everyone. Prince Seventeen will be famous all around the universe.” One of the guards sighed.

After the word Betrayal appeared, there were no more Kingese symbols. Bai Qing Xia’s power went dim. He released his king body and told Han Sen, “Brother Sixteen! I received eleven words, so it is now your turn.”

“What is your king body’s name?” Han Sen gave the man a haughty look. He knew what it was, but he pretended he didn’t.

“Genzo King Body,” Bai Qing Xia said calmly. He didn’t rise to Han Sen’s provocation.

“Your Genzo King Body isn’t too bad if it obtained eleven Kingese,” Han Sen said casually. It sounded like he was trying to comfort the other prince.

“Ha! This guy is so arrogant. If he cannot get a word, what is he going to do?” Hearing Han Sen say that, Miss Mirror couldn’t help but laugh.

All the princes and princesses were shocked to hear this. Although they already knew that Bai Yi was the arrogant sort, they didn’t know his arrogance came along with a whole heap of ignorance, too.

“Does he not know what it means to get eleven Kingese symbols? Does he not know what Betrayal means?” Prince Nineteen held his face in his hands. He was speechless.

Bai Canglang laughed. “Old Sixteen is grumpy. He surely has a little bi-polar disorder. He never had a chance of being anyone important, so it’s not strange that he’s ignorant of what Betrayal means. But no matter how dumb he is, he should know what having eleven Kingese means. He is probably just being stubborn.”

“I really don’t know how this guy managed to claim the alpha statue.” That was still a sore spot for Prince Nineteen, it seemed.

Prince Nineteen had been to the Pavilion many times. He had wanted to keep coming until he claimed the alpha statue, but he had repeatedly failed. He couldn’t believe the alpha statue was actually claimed by that Bai Yi, who he had always looked down upon. He hated him. He hated Bai Yi, who was actually Han Sen in disguise.

“Let’s see how many Kingese he gets. It will be funny if he is unable to get any.”

“It is hard to say. After all, he did manage to claim the alpha statue. There is no way he’ll leave without a single one.”

“Who knows? Maybe getting the alpha statue was pure, dumb luck.”

“Then do you think he will receive the word Luck?”

“Perhaps.”

Many guards and royal children were watching intently. Han Sen’s eyes looked up at that tree that looked like a golden sky. He was looking at the Kingese symbols while he mumbled, “Give me a pretty man... Handsome man... Whatever it is... I do not want much... With my face... I should get a word like Fan, just as Bai Qing Xia did.”

While he was mumbling, Han Sen activated his Original Water King Body. His body became a blob of water, and even his armor became water. He was like a water man standing atop the dragon’s head. He was looking up at the gold sky.

Bai Yi’s personality was a grumpy one. He often started arguments. Everyone there had seen his Original Water King Body before, and so it was nothing surprising.

Compared to Bai Qing Xia’s Genzo King Body, the Original Water King Body wasn’t bad. But water was weak. It was better suited to healing abilities.

But Bai Yi was too ill-tempered. He didn’t want to learn a healing geno art. He had forced himself to learn a destructive water element skill instead, so he hadn’t achieved much. He wasn’t the number one compared to all those King class princes. He was in a medium-low bracket. Because of that, many of the royal children thought his Original Water King Body was rather weak.

In reality, the Original Water King Body wasn’t much worse than the Genzo King Body. Bai Yi had just never used it well.

Han Sen activated the Original Water King Body, and his body took on a water light. It connected with the king tree. The leaves rustled, and amidst their golden lights, a king leaf shone. The Kingese symbol was like a sun falling down. It was going to Han Sen.

That word was so watery, it looked like floating water. It looked like a scary wave. It was very pretty, and there was a heavy rain and a storm going with it. It possessed the word Shui.

Bai Yi received the word meaning water. Everyone expected this since he had the Original Water King Body. It would be weird if he didn’t receive water.

“It is better than nothing,” Han Sen thought. And so, he waited for the word to come down and touch his head.

As the word water was about to touch down on his head, Han Sen prepared to claim the Kingese power. But the word stopped one centimeter above his forehead.
