Chapter 2560: Godfather Han Sen

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

As the white light shone brighter and brighter in the dark, it became impossible to miss. Many deified elites noticed its presence, and their faces were all drawn in shock.

As he watched through a video screen, Ji Yang Sheng noticed the white dot. The white dot was too small, though. It didn’t necessarily mean that Barr was deified yet, so he wasn’t sure what it meant.

“A substance chain... That is a substance chain! Barr is going to become deified...” Moldo, who was next to him, saw the white dot. His face warped, and he could barely believe his eyes.

“What? What did you say, Mr. Moldo?” Ji Yang Sheng thought he might have heard that incorrectly. So, he asked Mister Moldo to repeat what he had said.

Before Moldo could reply, Ji Yang Sheng was answered in an unmistakable way.

That white dot grew quickly, and the black Destroyed power became white all of a sudden. It was like fire as it wreathed around Barr’s body.

Only Barr’s black bones remained, but those bones were now becoming white. And that white Destroyed power started to rebuild his flesh.

Boom!

Before Barr could emerge from that white Destroyed power, the fabric of space seemed to twist and tear. It was like the universe was falling apart. Barr’s body fell into that space and vanished.

When Barr disappeared, the scary collapse of space stopped.

“What is going on? I don’t think Barr had finished changing. Why did he vanish?” Many people were confused by what they saw. They didn’t know why space had seemed to collapse around Barr.

“He became deified. The core area doesn’t allow deified elites to enter. Once he became deified, he had to be kicked out of the core,” said someone who understood.

“Barr... became deified...” Ji Yang Sheng was shocked. And then, he felt so annoyed and jealous. If he had paid the two thousand genes that had been requested of him, he was the one who would be deified right now.

“Really? Barr became deified?” Someone in the audience didn’t believe what they had just witnessed.

“He is deified? This has to be a hoax. Come on, are you telling me Han Sen made another deified?”

“Does anyone mind explaining to me how this could happen?”

“He is God’s Daddy. That’s why, and this is further evidence. He really can do this.”

“Two thousand King xenogeneic genes? You only need two thousand King xenogeneic genes to be made deified? This world has gone mad. Or am I the one that has been driven insane? Since when did deifieds become so cheap?”

At that moment, the whole universe seemed to go crazy. Everyone that looked at Han Sen no longer saw a person. They saw a god statue that people could make wishes before. They all wanted to go before him and bow, hoping to have their foreheads touched and be made deified.

“Barr really became deified?” The Sixth Uncle stared at his screen with a gaping mouth. He struggled to close it. Up until Han Sen departed the core area, he looked strange.

“It will be easy enough for us to find out if Barr really did become deified. All we have to do is send someone over to the Destroyed and learn the truth right from the horse’s mouth,” Meng Lie said.

Every race leader was doing the same thing as the Extreme King. They wanted to learn about Barr’s condition. Barr didn’t remain hidden for long, though. He stood before everyone, not hiding the power he received by becoming deified.

“He really did become deified.” There was no doubt about it now. Every person of the higher races looked at Han Sen as if he was mad. Everyone was waving their xenogeneic genes, hoping they could draw Han Sen out to bless them.

Two thousand xenogeneic genes was a high number, but compared to being a deified, it was nothing. It was peanuts. Exchanging two thousand King xenogeneic genes to become a deified was more than worth it.

If Han Sen was willing to give more blessings, every high race would pay for blessings until they bankrupted themselves.

Arthur had watched Barr become deified. He was so happy about the result. Two thousand King xenogeneic genes had been handed out in return for a deified Barr. This was so f*cking worth it.

Even Dia Robber was surprised. He thought Han Sen’s blessing would only reinforce Barr’s genes. He hadn’t expected Barr to become a deified straight away.

“This man is too scary.” Dia Robber wasn’t that surprised about Barr becoming deified, though. He was worried more than anything.

It wasn’t just Dia Robber feeling this way, either. Many elites of the higher race were scared of Han Sen. This was a fear that they had never experienced before.

A King class being was manufacturing deified beings. It was almost too shocking to believe. He was able to take the whole universe and flip it on its head.

Ordinary Kings and nobles didn’t think much of it, though. They just thought what Han Sen had done was something of a miracle.

“Mr. Godfather is too strong, but I don’t have two thousand King class genes. Maybe if I did, I would ask him to bless me so I could become deified.”

“Two thousand xenogeneic genes are far beyond what I have. Would he take women, instead? I would pay with my body if I could.”

“Stop dreaming. Look in the mirror. Are you as pretty as those two women the Godfather has?”

“F*ck! He has all the good stuff, and he has sick power. He even has insanely pretty women. He has it all.”

Han Sen was randomly bestowed this Godfather title. Before, many people referred to Han Sen as God’s Daddy. But that title was a secret one, and not something they would refer to him as in public.

After this event, though, the Godfather title became quite common. It made him sound like a clergyman, but it didn’t mean that.

Ji Yang Sheng was the most depressed of all now, though. He had pulled the rickshaw for Han Sen for a very long time. He even gave him five hundred King class xenogeneic genes. He received nothing in return. Instead, Barr was made deified.

If God gave Ji Yang Sheng the chance to do things over, he would tell Han Sen, “Yes, I will give them to you.”

If he had known that Han Sen could really make people deified, he would have been willing to pay more than two thousand King xenogeneic genes. He would have been willing to pay double that sum.

The only issue was that no one had believed Han Sen could make others deified before this. After all, it did sound a little ridiculous.

When Han Sen entered the core area, the Kings of every race came out and shocked Han Sen.

“Teacher Han, I brought you two thousand King xenogeneic genes. If you are willing to bless me, I will give them to you.”

“Get lost! What is this about two thousand King xenogeneic genes? You are being that cheap before the Godfather? I have 2500 King class xenogeneic genes. I should be blessed first.”

“I have 3000...”

Even Ji Yang Sheng had brought two thousand King class xenogeneic genes to Han Sen, but when he saw how busy things were, he didn’t fancy his chances. He felt so sad.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
