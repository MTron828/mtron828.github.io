Chapter 1593: Wind Song Desert

On Han Sen’s way back, he continued reading through the information Second Uncle provided him.

He found information pertaining to key individuals of the New Community, including details of their whereabouts. There were three planets Second Uncle believed might be possible locations for their headquarters, and also possible locations for their leader.

But Second Uncle also told Han Sen not to provoke the New Community. He told Han Sen the reason they had not yet taken action was most likely due to them being afraid of something. But if Han Sen didn’t get rid of them now, it would only be a matter of time before they came after him.

So, Han Sen decided it would be best if he struck first. The only problem with this was not knowing which planet the leader was currently residing on.

Looking at the information he had been provided, some of the New Community’s members were actually rather famous and accomplished people, from both the human and shura sides. It was difficult to imagine how the leader had managed to unify the two races that way, as well.

The person that caught Han Sen’s attention the most was Qing Ya. He was a mysterious one, and not even the Ling family was able to tell where he came from. But with that being said, he was a high-ranking member of the New Community and one of the most important people in the organization.

No one had seen him fight before, but it was known that he had the ability to teleport at will.

“The man who saved Tina must have been Qing Ya.” Han Sen carefully memorized all the information pertaining to that man. With power like that, the man would be a dangerous foe even if he couldn’t fight.

Han Sen looked down to see if his father was included in the list. But after browsing through everything, it didn’t seem as if there was a mention of his father.

“Is Dad’s rank too low in the New Community? Is that why he didn’t make the cut?” Han Sen thought to himself.

A few days later, after Han Sen returned home, he spent some more time in research. He wasn’t sure if Second Uncle’s intent for co-operation was genuine, but knowing more about any potential threat was always for the best.

Han Sen met his father-in-law Ji Ruozhen and told him what had transpired in his meeting with Second Uncle. He also provided him the information Second Uncle had given him. If they were able to locate the leader, Han Sen would go and fight.

Han Sen was not the strongest in the sanctuary, but in space, he had the Crystal Armor and his beetle. He had more power than the strongest demi-god.

Returning to the shelter, Han Sen heard more people talking about Death Goddess. They were talking about who might have provoked her and how she was able to one-hit kill her enemies.

All conversations in the Fourth Sanctuary seemed to revolve around either Death Goddess or Dollar. And there was frequent chatter about who they believed to be better.

Han Sen knew his power was still lagging a good distance behind Death Goddess, however. He didn’t think he would be a formidable opponent for her yet. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Strength is still the most important thing.” After Han Sen’s investigation, he settled on traveling to Wind Song Desert to hunt down super creatures so he could max out his super geno points and get to fighting the most elite of the elites.

The reason he selected Wind Song Desert was because it was notoriously dangerous there, and also because there were no super shelters around.

There were supposed to be a lot of lone super creatures out there. Killing a super creature there would be easier than trying to take down a super shelter.

Han Sen decided to bring Little Silver and Little Star with him, as well. Little Star had the Starsea travel powers, so if he ended up in bad shape, he could flee with ease.

Little Silver had strong healing abilities. And whenever they were in trouble, Han Sen could make use of the Blow Blood geno core. Han Sen would have to spill blood to use the geno core, and Little Silver’s healing would help for that necessity, at the very least.

And of course, Han Sen brought Bao’er with him wherever he went. He’d never leave her behind.

Lady Chef heard about him going to Wind Song Desert and she seemed determined to follow him, no matter what. So he brought her along, as well.

There was also Xu Mi. Han Sen didn’t want to bring him along, as he was afraid something bad might happen to the spirit. He couldn’t explain a grievous mishap to Xu Mi’s parents, but Xu Mi was just as determined to come. He was convinced the outing would make for good practice. He said if Han Sen would not let him come, he’d just go alone, anyway.

So, Han Sen really had no choice but to let him tag along, too. If he went alone, it’d be a great deal more dangerous. The monsters in the desert would not recognize Furnace Emperor’s heir, either.

Wang Yuhang wanted to come, but Han Sen left him behind for obvious reasons.

That place was dangerous, and if Wang Yuhang followed, Han Sen couldn’t imagine the terrible misfortunes that might befall them. The last thing he wanted was to end up surrounded by super creatures in such a place.

Everything was good on the way there, but when they entered the desert, a sandstorm immediately hit. It cloaked the sky and made darkness fall. Luckily, Han Sen was able to find a rocky place for them to take shelter. No trouble befell them there.

With their combined power, normal sandstorms wouldn’t affect them. But the sandstorms in Wind Song Desert were different. Sitting in the cave, Han Sen heard a strange noise howl through the raging storm. It was like a woman that was singing in the wind.

Even in the midst of that sandstorm, he could hear the singing clearly. Weirdly, though, he couldn’t understand a word of what was being sung. But this was also how the desert received its name: Wind Song Desert.

“I’ve heard if there is singing in the sandstorm and you cannot find a place to hide in time, you will be lost in the sandstorm forever. This even happens to powerful super creatures. I wonder if it is true?” Xu Mi looked out of the cave, listening to the song outside.

“I advise you not to find out,” Lady Chef said coldly.

“Something is getting close to the cave, leastways.” Han Sen frowned and continued looking outside.

Lady Chef and Xu Mi looked to where he was watching, and aside from a black and yellow sandstorm, they could not make out anything unusual.

Xu Mi looked closer but did not see anything. Just as he was about to ask Han Sen what he had seen, a form began to emerge from the sandstorm.

The body looked human-shaped. Everyone was suddenly alert.

After a few more steps, the body came right into the cave. It was covered in black and yellow sand. When the being shook itself a little, the person beneath the sand slowly became visible.

“Han Sen!” Before anyone could react, the shadow saw Han Sen and blurted out his name in shock.
