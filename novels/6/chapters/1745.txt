Chapter 1746 Holy Heaven

“Is that your daughter?” In Qiao’s house, Qiao and Lan Se looked at Han Sen and Bao’er—who was sitting on the sofa—in shock.

“Yeah, I went out to bring her here,” Han Sen said.

“No way. You don’t look similar at all.” Lan Se shook her head.

“Why don’t we look similar? See? We look like father and daughter.” Han Sen shoved his face next to Bao’er’s, and she shoved her head against his. They smiled in tandem.

“Your daughter looks much better than you, though,” Lan Se said immediately.

Han Sen suddenly started to sweat, and he was robbed of words. He wasn’t ugly, he was just manly. He probably wasn’t as pretty as Bao’er.

“It’s okay that she is here, but you can’t let her presence interfere with work. Let the auntie look after her while we’re off on missions,” Qiao said, standing up.

Han Sen wouldn’t want to leave Bao’er at home, though. He was worried she might tear the house down in his absence.

“How can you be a father? You let a kid this young travel with you? Is that really your daughter?” Qiao frowned.

Han Sen gave a wry smile, and he said, “Honestly? I don’t want to take Bao’er on an adventure with me, but I don’t feel safe leaving her at home. I will bring her along, but don’t worry; it’ll be fine.”

Qiao and Lan Se did not agree with Han Sen’s desire, but if Han Sen insisted on bringing her, they had no choice but to allow it.

Lan Se needed to work now, and she wasn’t a part of Wizard. There was only Qiao and Han Sen left. Counting Bao’er, their entire team was three people.

“We’re not taking this there, are we?” Han Sen saw Qiao pulling a cover off of a motorcycle. Seeing it depressed him. Qiao tossed Han Sen a helmet and got on it, saying, “You know my car got destroyed on our last mission. And the xenogeneic body only sold for seven thousand. After paying our expenses, I only had enough to buy this second-hand motorcycle. If you want money, work harder and kill more xenogeneics.”

Han Sen gave the helmet to Bao’er and hopped on. Qiao gunned the motor and sped off. Although it was second-hand, it was in great condition.

“They are still haunting us.” After riding for half a day, and upon almost reaching their destination, they saw a group of cars and aircraft. The Black Gold Group’s symbol was blazed visibly upon them. Qiao cursed them quietly.

Qiao didn’t stop moving, though. She drove up to a convoy of cars, and there was no way to proceed. So, they had to stop.

Hardman, Lena, and Guris approached. Hardman smiled. He waved at Qiao. He then ignored her and turned to speak to Han Sen. “Han Sen, long time no see. If you have the time, we should sit down for a drink sometime.”

“Manager Hard, aren’t you a bit desperate, trying this in front of me?” Qiao mocked him.

“That’s only because I’m desperate for smart people. So, Han Sen; do you have the time? How about we go someplace quiet and talk?” Hardman didn’t sound angry, and he spoke jovially.

Hardman was getting desperate, too. The third master would soon be back. If he couldn’t get his re-hiring done, embarrassment would be the least of his troubles.

“I am sorry, Manager Hard. We need to kill a xenogeneic right now! We do not have the time for this,” Han Sen said coldly. “Manager Hard, did you hear that? Excuse us,” Qiao said.

Hardman did not move his men. He just shook his head and said, “If you are going to the Black River for a xenogeneic, there is no need for you to go.”

“Why? Did you buy the river? Why can’t other teams go there for the hunt?” Qiao frowned. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Hardman waved his hand and said, “Black Gold Group isn’t that rich. Truthfully, we cannot go, either.”

“What does that mean?” Qiao sounded surprised.

Hardman signaled for Lena to explain. She said, “The people from Holy Heaven are there.”

When Qiao heard the words Holy Heaven, her face changed. She looked to be in disbelief, and she said, “Holy Heaven? What are they doing here? You’re telling me that they care about some small-time xenogeneic?”

“Yes,” Guris answered. “They are at the Black River and are camped there. We can’t even get close enough to take a peek.”

“Han Sen, you are here! You said you would teach me sword skills, but I wasn’t able to find you.” Mister Tiger approached from the frontlines. He kept walking, telling Han Sen as he went, “Are you here to kill a xenogeneic? You’re in bad luck. I don’t know why, but Holy Heaven’s people are here for the xenogeneic. I’m not sure why they’d want it, but they’ve sent two people out for it.”

Hearing Mister Tiger say all this, Qiao realized that they weren’t lying. Holy Heaven had indeed come to Black River.

“What is Holy Heaven? Another big group?” Han Sen was confused. He had never heard of a big company such as that before.

“I wish it was another company. At least we could compete, that way.” Qiao lowered her voice and said, “Holy Heaven means Feathers. They are a superior race. They are born Nobles. All of them have had their second evolution. They are so powerful, and they even took down a xenogeneic space for a camp. The camp was called Holy Heaven, so that is why they are commonly referred to as such.”

“Planet Kate is tiny compared to Holy Heaven. We have no choice but to listen to their commands; if you don’t, then you’ll die without even knowing how.” Guris slumped his shoulders.

Han Sen frowned. He had seen a Feather before, but it was retarded. Even so, it was very scary. They weren’t like normal people.

A few people were discussing matters when some movement came from ahead in the convoy. They saw a man and woman who looked like angels flying their way.

The man was handsome, and the woman was pretty. They were two meters tall, with gold armor. The woman had a bow, whereas the man wielded a lance. They looked like angelic warriors.

“Do Feathers have genders?” Han Sen was curious, as the Feather he’d seen hadn’t possessed a gender.

“Feathers are unique, and they aren’t assigned a gender when born. When they become adults, though, they do.” Qiao gave a silent gesture at the two Feathers flying towards them.
