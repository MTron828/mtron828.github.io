Chapter 2604 Making a Butterfly by Hand

The people of Sky Palace could see the God Spirit Touch on Han Sen’s hand. Then a red light manifested in Han Sen’s palm. It was then that they realized what was going on.

“There it is! There it is! Here it comes again. It must be that thing... you know what I’m talking about.”

“You jest, surely! It can’t be that thing that got Brother Han the title of God’s Daddy.”

“I bet you it is. Did you know that I watched him bless Barr? What I’m seeing here is that exact same red light.”

“What is this all about then? Isn’t the beetle supposed to be testing Brother Han’s talent? Why is Brother Han helping the God Spirit Touch evolve instead?”

“Maybe they’re no longer testing. Brother Han’s eleven armor talent is so strong. Did you not see the God Spirit Touch crawl over to Han Sen? Perhaps it’s requesting his aid.”

“I must confess that this really is starting to become an... interesting turn of events, to say the least...”

Exquisite and Bixi felt an odd swirl of emotions within their chests. They had heard the tales of Han Sen blessing Lando and Barr, but they thought there must have been some sort of trick to the whole thing. There was no way Lando and Barr became deified because of his power.

But the God Spirit Touch belonged to Bixi, and he knew a lot about the little creature. He knew the God Spirit Touch would never become deified. So, he was conflicted and confused when he saw what Han Sen was aspiring to do.

Everyone was watching the God Spirit Touch in Han Sen’s and. It was covered by a small, red light. The crystalline body started to glow.

All of the red light rose from the God Spirit Touch’s body. And its oval body grew smaller.

The God Spirit Touch had lived for God knew how long. The Very High had taken it in so it could repeatedly test people. It had absorbed the genes of many creatures, and the blood it had consumed featured many nine armor talents across the years. And all it had been given was for free.

Although the God Spirit Touch couldn’t properly absorb the genes in the blood, it had received many benefits. With the amount of resources it had received, it should have become deified a long time ago.

But its talents were limited, and it couldn’t break through the last stage. It stopped at half-deified. Right now, it was breaking through like the wall was nothing more than paper. And it was all attributed to Han Sen’s Blood-Pulse Sutra. The God Spirit Touch was now becoming deified. Its genes no longer limited it anymore.

Han Sen had only cast a small amount of his Blood-Pulse Sutra to lightly push the self-cogwheel.

Everyone looked at Han Sen, holding the God Spirit Touch. And then, a light appeared out of the God Spirit Touch. It was such a small bug, but the light from its body reached all the way up into space. It lit up the whole system, and deifieds throughout the system turned to look in that direction.

Katcha!

Amidst the light, as the bug’s body became smaller, cracks started to form. A small crystal claw emerged.

And then, another crystal claw came into view. And then a body. Through the shining light, onlookers could barely make out a crystal butterfly starting to emerge. It flapped its wings and happily danced around Han Sen.

When the crystal butterfly flapped its wings, its light became clearer. Its substance chains became visible. The substance chains formed together into a giant butterfly wing. It lit up the whole of Sky Palace.

Everyone was shocked. Before, they thought this was awesome because they had seen it on video. Seeing what happened through a screen hadn’t left a terribly deep impression on them, though.

But now, they were seeing a creature become deified right in Han Sen’s hands. His hands

ere like the hands of a god. They had an unlimited amount of power, and they were full of magic. He could turn even trash into the working of a miracle. It was difficult to believe.

As they watched Han Sen hold the deified crystal butterfly gracefully in his hands, it was like he was the creator of God.

“It really became deified?” Bixi and Exquisite were more shocked than the others. They had doubted Han Sen’s blessing powers before. But now, he had lackadaisically made Bixi’s God Spirit Touch deified. This power was more than Bixi and Exquisite knew what to do with. Even the Very High elders couldn’t accomplish something like this.

The God Spirit Touch had just become a crystal butterfly, and it was now flying merrily around Han Sen’s hands. It flew around Han Sen three times. And then, it suddenly flapped its crystal wings and disappeared. It just vanished all of a sudden.

Everyone was frozen, and they all looked at Bixi. They thought Bixi had returned it.

But Bixi was frozen, too. His coldness and calmness were now all gone. He looked at Han Sen, his expression rigid. It looked as if he was wondering where the God Spirit Touch had gone.

Katcha!

Bixi’s face changed. He felt as if something in his pocket had just snapped. He felt bad. He quickly reached into his pocket. The spell that had the God Spirit Touch’s symbol was now broken.

The Very High used a secret skill to tame the God Spirit Touch. That spell was the key to its control. It was like a leash for the creature.

As long as the spell was there, he could control the God Spirit Touch, and the creature couldn’t disobey. If the master desired it, the God Spirit Touch would suffer pain that would make the creature wish it was dead.

When the God Spirit Touch became deified, Bixi hadn’t immediately seen the problem. Now that the spell was broken, he realized what had happened. His stomach sank. No God Spirit Touch had become deified before this. The Very High’s secret skill was only used on creatures that were half-deified or below. The God Spirit Touch was a creature that was easy to control. But now that it had become deified, it destroyed the secret skill. It became free and ran off.

The God Spirit Touch wasn’t a top-class xenogeneic, but it was very rare. Most of them were given out by Very High parents. If Bixi lost it, he couldn’t get it back.

“Mr. Bixi, did you put your God Spirit Touch away?” Han Sen looked at Bixi. The question was irrelevant, though. Judging from the perplexed look on Bixi’s face, Han Sen knew that he hadn’t. He knew that the God Spirit Touch had actually escaped.

He couldn’t openly admit it had run away, though. Bixi might try to hold him responsible for what had happened.Bixi frowned. He didn’t blame Han Sen for letting the God Spirit Touch escape. He only coldly said, “The God Spirit Touch became deified when it transformed into a butterfly. It broke my restraints and ran.”

The Sky Palace students, upon hearing that the God Spirit Touch had become deified right from Bixi’s mouth, believed it now.

“It looks like the legends concerning you are true. Brother Han really can bless others.”

“Well, duh. Of course, he can! Why else would you think Brother Han was labeled God’s Daddy?” “This is too awesome... He is a King class that can produce xenogeneic deifieds! That is better than what most deifieds themselves can do!” The Sky Palace students discussed all this happily. They felt very hopeful. If Han Sen stayed in Sky Palace, perhaps Han Sen would be willing to bless them sometime.

Many of the Sky Palace elites that saw this were feeling flat-out strange. It had been a bewildering thing to witness, after all. But many disregarded their confusion to simply revel in the result. And the results made them more than happy. Still, more than anything, there was one emotion they couldn’t deny, and that emotion was worry.

Other races would take Han Sen’s abilities very seriously after seeing this. Sky Palace would no longer be a mellow place.

There were the Extreme King, first of all. They no longer had a good relationship with Sky Palace. That being said, Sky Palace wasn’t afraid of them.

But now, the Very High had seen Han Sen’s power in person. It was difficult to tell whether they would want to do something with Han Sen or not.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
