Chapter 3162 God of Wealth Blood-Pulse

He knew it was just an illusion and a weird scene. Still, seeing the money tree with lots of coins hanging from its boughs and feeling the aura of the gold money tree and a sky full of stars made him open his eyes wide.

The coins on the money tree fell off. They were going straight for Feng Yin Yin. They melted into her body. Her body was given a God Spirit mark that resembled a coin. It immediately started to shine. Its voluminosity grew brighter and brighter.

The tree full of coins fell. It all melted into Feng Yin Yin’s body. At the same time, the Sky God Crown received a wonderful message.

Spirit Strength: Ten star

Gene potential: Ten star

Compatibility: Nine star

Overall: S-class Blood-Pulse inheritor

“Do the God Spirits use this to decide who to give their Blood – Pulses to?” At the same time, Han Sen received even more messages from the Sky God Crown.

There were options for giving the person’s Blood-Pulse. There were four choices: one corner, broken, perfect, and inheritor.

One corner meant one God Spirit Blood-Pulse would be given at random. It was the lowest level a God Spirit Blood-Pulse could impart. It gave a person a small God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It did not do much. It just made people a beginner-level gene caster.

Broken God Spirit Blood – Pulses were better. Some features of the God Spirits were there, but they were not complete. They were not strong either.

There was no need to explain things about perfect. It basically meant giving a person a perfect God Spirit Blood-Pulse and creating a contract. When the person needed it, they could call upon the God Spirit’s contract to combine and fight with their aid.

God Spirits were able to use their inherited Blood-Pulse. It gave them extra power to fight. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Of course, God Spirits gave humans these benefits to make humans grow. When humans had a contract with a gene race, God Spirits would take some of that power for themselves. It was mutually beneficial, as it helped humans grow. When humans gained a gene race, God Spirits were able to take some of that power. The stronger the gene race was, the more power they were able to take for themselves.

The power taken away was used to make a god base.

When God Spirits gave humans a Blood Pulse, it also meant risking the chance of causing damage to themselves. If the human selected was not very good, a God Spirit would not dare give them a perfect Blood-Pulse. It would not give out an inheritor Blood-Pulse.

Feng Yin Yin was quite excellent. Although she was not a perfect match, an S-rank ranking made her worthy of an inheritor Blood-Pulse.

Regardless of how poor Feng Yin Yin’s review might have been, Han Sen would have still given her an inheritor Blood – Pulse. In his eyes, Feng Yin Yin was perfect enough.

“In the name of God of Wealth, I give you my Blood-Pulse. Feng Yin Yin, do you want to be my inheritor?” Han Sen’s hands touched Feng Yin Yin’s forehead. The Sky God Crown shone with a god light. It put Feng Yin Yin inside the god light.

“I am willing,” Feng Yin Yin seriously answered.

Boom!

Sky God Crown’s gold god light was like a spring of water. It gushed down onto the coin mark on her mark forehead. A weird connection formed between them.

After the inheritor ritual was performed, Han Sen felt the Sky God Crown power lessen. The whole of the God of Wealth Temple’s light started to dim. If God of Wealth Temple did not have Decapitation Queen guarding it, it would have become a Disaster God Spirit. The God of Wealth Temple was not able to suppress it.

Han Sen thought, “I don’t know when the power of the Sky God Crown will be restored. Inheritor Blood-Pulses cannot be given out like candy.”

“San Mu, you really are a God Spirit!” Feng Yin Yin knew Han Sen was the God of Wealth, but her attitude did not change. She joyfully smiled and looked extremely excited.

Han Sen told Feng Fei Fei, “This is our secret. Don’t tell anyone, and that includes your Auntie.” He did not want people looking at him like he was a monster.

“This will be a secret between you and me,” Feng Yin Yin said as she blinked her eyes. “Now, we wait for Feng Yin Yin to get a gene race. After that, I will start reaping my benefits.” Han Sen was very hopeful, but he did not know how many gene races Feng Yin Yin could earn before giving him the necessary power to make a god base.

After thinking it over, Han Sen decided to bring out a king-class gene egg to give to Feng Yin Yin. He smiled and said, “Try this out. Can you use your God of Wealth Blood-Pulse to hatch it?”

Feng Yin Yin did not mind trying. She accepted the gene egg and used the God of Wealth Blood-Pulse to try and tame it. An Annihilation God Spirit Blood-Pulse was very good. The king-class gene egg was absorbed into the God Spirit mark. It quickly hatched.

At the same time, Han Sen felt a weird power come from the God Spirit mark. It went into the Sky God Crown.

Han Sen felt disappointed. While wearing the Sky God Crown, that power was like pouring a glass of water into a swimming pool. It did not do much. To create a god base, he needed a lot more power than that.

Fortunately, if a gene race evolved in Feng Yin Yin’s God Spirit mark in the future, Han Sen could take some of that power. The greater the power of the gene race was, the more power he would receive in return.

Now, it was just hatching. It was understandable that the power gained was low.

“It is no wonder why God Spirits favor many members. If it was just one member, who knows how long it could ever take to form another god base?” Han Sen ransacked his mind for solutions on how to bring more members to his god temple.

After thinking it over, killing the God Chaos Party’s members could earn him a god base with each kill. That was a more direct way to his woes than slaving away to recruit members.

“I wonder where Rocky Dee’s god temple is.” Han Sen wanted to kill Rocky Dee, but he was unable to locate him. He could not even find his god temple.

He took Feng Yin Yin and Bao’er back to Feng castle. Feng Fei Fei was already back, and she had been looking for them.

When Feng Fei Fei saw them in the garden, she asked with confusion, “Where have you guys been? I’ve been looking all over for you.”

She had already asked the maids in the castle, and no one had seen them around. They were nowhere to be found.

“Little Auntie, why are you looking for us?” Feng Yin Yin tried to change the subject.

Feng Fei Fei’s mood was fine. She did not ask any more about her last question. She pulled Feng Yin Yin’s hand and said, “Little Yin, I spoke to God Speak King. He has allowed you to pray before the Prophet God for a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. You should ready yourself. We are going to Prophet God Temple tomorrow.”

Feng Yin Yin looked a little irritated as she said, “Auntie, there is no need. I have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse now.”

“What?” Feng Fei Fei was frozen. She looked to be in a state of disbelief. “How could you have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse?”

With mustered courage, Feng Yin Yin said, “Auntie, I asked San Mu to take me to God of Wealth Temple. I received the God of Wealth Blood-Pulse from the God of Wealth Temple.”

Feng Fei Fei was shocked. Her face kept morphing into different expressions. No words could describe how she felt.

She had put so much effort into this happening. The amount of effort she had put in, the favors she owed, and the strings she had pulled to earn this opportunity for Feng Yin Yin were unquantifiable. One sentence from Feng Yin Yin threw it all away.
