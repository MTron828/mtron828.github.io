Chapter 3248 Good and Bad

Inside the jade carriage, a beautiful and gentle lady poured out a drink for the man. She asked with curiosity, “Mister, was that man’s knife skills very strong?”

“His movements were full of all the signs of a knifeman’s presence, but knives did not exist in his heart. He was just someone who practiced with a knife. No matter how strong a knife skill is, without God, you can only be a bit stronger. He is not literally powerful.” His face looked kingly as he spoke. The man was wearing white fur. He held a snow-white cup and spoke coldly. If a noble from the seven kingdoms saw that person, they would recognize him. It was the first mister of the Chu Kingdom. His name was Chu Yuan. He was different from the four misters of the Qin Kingdom. Chu Yuan was a real first mister.

Chu Yuan was born to the Chu Kingdom’s royal family. He was not directly related to the king, but he was very talented. He was very smart, so he quickly became famous in the Chu Kingdom.

It was hard to say what the Chu Yuan’s power was like. It was just the way he was obsessed with knife skills. No ordinary universe of kingdoms elite could compare with him.

The elites of the universe of kingdoms used external power. They never had to practice or hone their bodies. Chu Yuan had been learning knife skills since a young age. His skills were not any weaker than his powers. They might have been even better.

At that level, which was stronger than his power, it was very rare to see in the universe of kingdoms.

Plus, Chu Yuan had the full support of the Chu Kingdom. All of his gene races and god pulses were top-tier stuff. He had eyes on the whole of the Chu Kingdom. He was like the top elite, and that was no exaggeration. Although the older people of the Chu Kingdom could likely fight Chu Yuan well, they were already hiding. They never revealed themselves. The Chu Kingdom had Chu Yuan firmly as their No. 1 character.

The beautiful maid was interested in Chu Yuan stopping his carriage to ask Han Sen some stuff. After hearing Chu Yuan’s speech, she was no longer interested.

She was very lucky to have become Chu Yuan’s close maid. Hearing that Han Sen was just a normal person who practiced with his knife and not with his heart, she no longer had a reason to be interested in him. Chu Yuan said, “Although that person was not a real knifeman, his knife skills must be strangely overbearing. If you encountered him in battle, you would be unable to rival him.”

“Thank you for teaching me, Mister.” The maid rolled her eyes and said, “Mister, this time, Xuan Mi Zong’s Tian Jing came to the ice fields to secure an ice jade evil lady. If she really finds it, you can easily go and rob them. Then, you will have another rare gene race. After that, you will be able to practice pure knife skills even better.”

“The ice jade evil lady’s existence is still little more than a myth,” Chu Yuan said. “If it really exists, getting it will not be easy.”

The servant strangely asked, “Why? Isn’t the ice jade evil lady a gene egg?” Chu Yuan squinted his eyes and said, “If whatever happened was just a gene egg, then even Wu Wei Dao Palace could not know the gene egg’s name in the first place.”

“Does that mean there is a secret in the middle of all this?” the maid asked with interest.

Chu Yuan nodded and said, “A billion years ago, this place was not a barren system. There used to be a kingdom here, but a super god pulse weird scene froze the entire system. The kingdom was destroyed, but the ice melted, and life forces returned. Still, no one has chosen to live here.”

“Does that mean that a billion years ago, the same super god pulse weird scene happened?” the maid asked with shock.

“You are right. The name ice jade evil lady comes from the last super god pulse weird scene. According to the Xuan Mi Zong leader from back then, he saw the gene egg. For some undetermined reason, he had not been able to take it away. It is something that is recorded in Xuan Mi Zong’s secret scrolls. Only the leader and inheritors can read it.” Chu Yuan placed the cup before his mouth and took a sip. He went on to say, “I only saw the Chu Kingdom’s scroll concerning the super god pulse by chance. Tian Jing is Xuan Mi Zong’s inheritor, so she must have seen the Xuan Mi Zong scrolls. By following her, we can be led to the ice jade evil lady gene egg. That is how we know why the Xuan Mi Zong leader did not take away the ice jade evil lady gene egg.” “I see,” the lady said with a laugh. “It is fortunate you already have a mole infiltrating the Xuan Mi Zong. Otherwise, chasing Tian Jing would be very difficult.” “I hope Tian Jing will not disappoint me,” Chu Yuan coldly said.

On the ice fields, Tian Jing and Zhen Xia were resting in an ice cave. They had been traveling across the ice fields for 10 days and had yet to find the so-called ice jade evil lady gene egg.

“Big Sister, you have not eaten a morsel in the longest time. Why don’t you rest here while I go out and hunt?” Zhen Xia smiled at Tian Jing while he spoke.

“Little Brother, be careful,” Tian Jing warned him. “Do not be reckless.”

“Don’t worry, Sister. I will be right back.” Zhen Xia looked at his sister with love and exited the cave. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Bao’er sat next to Tian Jing. She held her jaw, blinking while asking Tian Jing, “Sister Jing, do you like Brother Xia?”

“You are a child. You don’t know anything. You do not know what love is. You do not know what the absence of love is.” Tian Jing seemed to blush as she spoke. She squeezed Bao’er’s face to veil the guiltiness she felt.

Zhen Xia was very tall and handsome. His personality was exceedingly caring too. He was the perfect example of a gentleman. Many women members of the Xuan Mi Zong loved him dearly, and Zhen Xia was extra nice to Tian Jing.

There were more women members of Xuan Mi Zong than there were men. It was hard for Tian Jing to have no feelings for Zhen Xia. Otherwise, she would not have brought him all the way out into the ice fields alone. “What do you mean that I don’t understand?” Bao’er seriously asked. “I think Brother Zhen is worse than my dad. If you like him, why don’t you like my dad?”

Tian Jing thought that was funny. There was a big difference separating the two. They could not be remotely compared to each other. She squeezed Bao’er’s cheek and said, “My silly girl. How old are you? How can you tell the difference between good and bad? Your daddy is a big bad guy. How can he be compared to Brother Zhen? They cannot, OK?”

“My dad is bad, but I think he is much better than your Brother Zhen,” Bao’er said.

“You are too young. When you grow up, you will come to understand what a really good man is like.” Tian Jing thought Bao’er was just a small child who did not know anything. She did not care for what she said.

Bao’er could tell that Tian Jing was not paying attention to her words, so she laughed and said, “Anyway, I think my dad is better.”

“Whatever. Let’s not talk about this again. When you come to Xuan Mi Zong with me, I will tell explain what is good and what is bad.” Tian Jing held Bao’er and softly told her, “Why don’t you sleep here for a while? When Brother Zhen brings his hunted food back, we will have meat to eat.”

Some footsteps sounded near the ice cave. Tian Jing frowned. It was because she could tell the footsteps did not belong to Zhen Xia.
