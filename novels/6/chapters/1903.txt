1904 Three Month Promise

The exchange was supposed to be a stage for Moon Garden and its members, but Han Sen’s Buddha writing and Gu Qingcheng’s display of sword skills made the aforementioned members—and the Buddhas—look rather lame. Han Sen was on the tip of everyone’s tongue now.

People thought Gu Qingcheng was a family member of Han Sen. Believing that, it meant one member of his family could beat Speechless Buddha. Han Sen also had Teeth Knife and created a mind simply by watching a Buddha’s performance. It was all so unbelievable. The whole of Narrow Moon was fascinated.

The real elites did not believe Han Sen’s words, though. They did not think he could learn as simply as he had claimed. Yisha was one of these non-believers, too. As soon as the exchange ended, Han Sen was summoned to the palace. “Where did you learn Touching Flower Finger?” Yisha asked.

“I found this book, and I learned Touching Flower Finger from it.” Han Sen gave Unlimited Sutra over to Yisha.

Han Sen had prepared an explanation when he borrowed Ancient Devil’s mind. But Ancient Devil’s mind had been too strong, and so Yisha found it difficult to believe him.

“This must be the original version of Unlimited Sutra. It is a secret skill of the Buddha. Where did you get it from?” Yisha looked at the Unlimited Sutra text and seemed very surprised.

“When I was young, I saved an injured man. He was an old fellow. I brought him home, and I healed him. He gave this to me before he left.” Han Sen had prepared all the stuff he was going to tell her.

“What did he look like? Can you confirm he was one of the Buddha?” Yisha asked.

“I was very young, so I didn’t know what a Buddha was back then. Even so, I don’t think he was. I’m fairly sure that the old man had hair.” Han Sen described Ancient Devil’s face to her, but with a few added years.

Yisha heard what he had to say, but she did not immediately respond. After a while of thought, she said, “You used this Unlimited Sutra to practice Touching Flower Finger to such a high degree of skill?”

“Yes,” Han Sen forced himself to say. He was going to pretend he was a genius, so Yisha might be willing to part with more resources. But Ancient Devil had deliberately overcast his mind and made Han Sen look ridiculous. He didn’t know if Yisha would believe him.

Yisha didn’t believe him entirely, either. It was just the Unlimited Sutra, from what she could see. There didn’t seem to be any extra guidance. Furthermore, Han Sen was just a commoner. No one should believe he could reach that level.

“It looks like you are a genius,” Yisha said, while looking right at Han Sen.

She could not completely trust what Han Sen said, but she was still happy about his performance. She didn’t want to think about Han Sen possibly lying.

“Thank you very much. I am a bit stupid, and others can learn many things. All I can learn is one thing at a time. I am afraid that is why I am so slow. I keep practicing, as I did with that, and that is how it happened,” Han Sen said.

Yisha looked at Unlimited Sutra, and then looked at Han. “Good. In that case, keep being this stupid self of yours. If your stupid way can enable you to practice Touching Flower Finger to such a high level, I am sure you can practice Teeth Knife knifemind just fine. Is three months enough for that, do you think?”

“My Queen, Teeth Knife is the ultimate knife skill. It is not all that easy to generate a knifemind. I am afraid I will only disappoint you again.” Han Sen pretended to look bitter. On the inside, however, he was delighted.

This was a two-birds-one-stone affair. With the title of a genius, he could use Teeth Knife knifemind without being required to hide his ability.

“Just this Unlimited Sutra can yield a mind like this? Right now, I will teach you. I will make you generate a knifemind. You don’t need a deep mind for this, and you are already willing to say you cannot achieve this? Are you telling me that Teeth Knife is worse than Unlimited Sutra? Or are you simply saying that I am a poor teacher?” Yisha looked coldly at Han Sen, as she spoke to him.

“That is not what I meant! I will do what I can. I will not disappoint you.” Han Sen quickly swore to God.

“Good. This is the good student I know.” Yisha nodded.

Yisha did not actually believe what Han Sen was telling her, but she did not want to mistakenly place blame on him. So, she gave Han Sen a test. If Han Sen could generate a Teeth Knife knifemind in three months, it really would prove that he was a genius. And if that was true, she would go ahead and treat him even better.

If Han Sen failed this, then Han Sen would have a problem. And if so, he would need to be investigated. She could not blindly spend resources on him.

Han Sen knew her thought process on this matter, though. And he was really happy about it. Generating a Teeth Knife knifemind was not even a test. It was way too easy.

“What is that family member of yours called? Where did you take her from?” Yisha asked.

“My Queen, her name is Gu Qingcheng. She is a member that comes from Planet Crooked Rock,” Han Sen said quickly.

“Not bad. But you should keep an eye on her. People with a swordmind like that are usually out for something else,” Yisha warned Han Sen.

Yisha knew many factions had sent spies to keep tabs on Han Sen. She thought Gu Qingcheng might be one of them.vThat was because Gu Qingcheng did not use all her powers against Speechless. Yisha wouldn’t feel this way if she had.

Yisha had much greater strength than Gu Qingcheng, but Gu Qingcheng’s swordmind might rival Yisha’s.

Speechless only received her mind from an old monster. Gu Qingcheng was the real old monster.

“Yes, I will ensure that I am careful.” Han Sen nodded.

After he left Yisha, Han Sen took a ship back to Planet Eclipse. He called Qiao, Lan Se, and Stay Up Late.

He invited them to Planet Eclipse, but Qiao and Lan Se thought things were fine with Seven Mirror. What’s more, they had friends there now. And so, they made no plans to go to Planet Eclipse.

Stay Up Late wanted to know more about the geno universe, so he made plans to come. He was hoping to learn more news about the location of Littleflower and Nine-Life Cat, too. He did not want to stay in the same place for too long.

After talking with Qiao, Han Sen returned his mind to Destiny’s Tower. There, he spoke with Ancient Devil. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ancient Devil was trapped in the tower, but he never assumed himself to be at a disadvantage. He spoke to Han Sen as if they were both equals.

When Han Sen borrowed help from Ancient Devil, he told Ancient Devil that if co-operation went well, he’d be willing to give him a chance.

Helping Han Sen with his mind was just a part of his show of sincerity. He had performed too well, though. Han Sen couldn’t be sure if he had done it on purpose, but Han Sen believed that he had.

“Ancient Devil, you should co-operate properly. You shouldn’t make stupid moves.” Han Sen hadn’t killed him because he knew too many secrets. And Han Sen wanted those secrets. All he could think about was finding a safe method for getting Ancient Devil to talk.

Han Sen wanted those secrets too badly to get rid of Ancient Devil.
