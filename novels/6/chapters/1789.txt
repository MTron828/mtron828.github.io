Han Sen lifted his own palm as he faced-off against Mister Ji. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The maid behind Mister Ji smiled and looked on with disdain. She thought to herself, “This person is arrogant. He thinks he is so great just for killing a few centaurs. He’s actually using his own palm against the master, pah! How dare he think he can compete with the Sky-Demon Sutra.”

As she thought this, both palms collided. And because the power was equalized, they were both sent reeling back.

Han Sen knew this would happen, but Mister Ji wasn’t prepared. It looked as if he couldn’t believe it.

The maid’s eyes and mouth opened wide, and she screamed. “How is that possible!”

“Do you still mean what you said?” Han Sen calmly asked Mister Ji. That calm was only on the surface, though.

After that strike, he knew he had just gone up against Falsified-Sky powers.

“Does Demon have a connection to the shura? Is Demon a race formed by the shura in the geno universe? Or are the shura a part of Demon perhaps?” Han Sen mulled potential answers for these questions, over and over. It was difficult to say.

Mister Ji wore a conflicted expression, and he said, “I spoke the truth. You can leave, and no trouble will pursue you when you depart.”

After that, Mister Ji said, “And if you are willing to, we can make a trade. If you succeed, not only will trouble not follow you today, but you will never have trouble on Planet Kate ever again. Furthermore, you will be granted a fine reward.”

“What sort of trade?” Han Sen asked, looking at Mister Ji.

The implications were clear. Mister Ji wouldn’t touch Han Sen for one day, but unless Han Sen got on that airship, he couldn’t run very far. Demon would control the entirety of Planet Kate soon. If Han Sen didn’t want to get killed, he’d have to make this trade.

Han Sen was not afraid of being chased, but he wanted to at least hear what the terms might be.

Han Sen was also interested in learning why those of Demon were able to make use of Falsified-Sky powers, and why they looked so similar to the shura.

“This is not a place for talking, so let us discuss this somewhere else.” Mister Ji waved for Han Sen to follow him.

And without hesitation, Han Sen accompanied him and they both left together.

After they left, all the Kate felt as if they had escaped death.

Someone had recorded the fight and uploaded it to the internet It created quite the fuss across many different races.

It depicted a Baron turning the streets into a killing field. Han Sen’s movement and sword skills garnered a lot of attention, in particular. They all wished to guess who he might have been.

Many people knew about the Pirate Bone Sword he had wielded. So, many guessed that he belonged to Pirate. But Pirate lacked people with techniques and talent as impressive as what the video showed.

While the sword skills known by Pirate were strong, they were not as strong as Han Sen’s.

The form Han Sen had filled-in on the ship was revealed. It identified his race as Human, and his name as Dollar. No one had heard of humans before, so no one knew where Dollar might actually be from. But many creatures remembered that Human and Dollar combo from that day onwards.

“It’s that *sshole!” On a pirate ship, a beautiful young lady was watching the video. She gritted her teeth.

It was Hai’er. After she had been robbed, she set out in search of Han Sen, but all traces of the man had vanished.

She believed it would be extremely difficult to find him, and the last thing she wanted to hear was that a Baron had made such bloody use of her Pirate Bone Sword and killed a xenogeneic Viscount amidst it all.

Hai’er watched the video and recognized both Han Sen and the sword. She was so mad, she really wanted to kill him.

“Hai’er, this Dollar stole your sword.” A man was also watching the video, and he looked greatly surprised.

“Yes, Uncle Rogge. You need to teach him a proper lesson and get the sword back,” Hai’er said to the man in a voice that she thought would sound cute.

Although Hai’er hated Han Sen’s guts, his display of power had impressed her. It would be difficult to find another fighter that could equal him, especially among the Barons. She knew if she was to exact revenge, she couldn’t do it alone.

Rogge sucked on a lollipop contemplatively. As he watched the video, he said, “Powerful guy. I’m afraid someone of the same tier would not be able to kill him.”

“He is just a Baron. If you want to kill him, it shouldn’t be difficult for you.” Hai’er clutched his arms tight

Rogge blinked and said, “My Little Hai’er wants help, eh? But you do know that if one of us Pirates seeks vengeance, we must do it by ourselves. Unless you die or something, of course. If I help you, Grandpa Pirate will kill me.”

“Rogge... Uncle... It is only the two of us. If we don’t tell him, he won’t know. Please help me!” Hai’er started to swing his arms.

“Fine. Fine. Stop shaking me,” Rogge said.

“So, you agree?” Hai’er sounded excited.

“I can’t actually do this myself, of course. You’ll have to get the sword yourself; otherwise, Grandpa Pirate will kill me.” Uncle

Rogge sucked his lollipop with a smile, and then he said, “I can most certainly help you level up to be a Viscount, though. He is strong, but if you are a Viscount, killing him won’t be difficult.”

She looked upset at first, but after hearing his offer, she seemed much happier. She said, “It would be good to kill that *sshole myself. How can I level up to be a Viscount in a short amount of time?”

“This is the geno material I was able to retrieve from a Marquis whale. It is from the Lightning Sea. I made battle pills from it. The next time you practice, consume one. I believe that within ten days, you can become a Viscount.” Rogge gave Hai’er a bottle of the stuff.

Hai’er accepted the bottle and bared her teeth, saying, “Dollar, I am going to take your life.”
