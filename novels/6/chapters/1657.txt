Chapter 1658 An Item with No Master

All the elites outside the valley were now dead. Death Goddess, who had been wholly stained with blood, now raced into the valley. She joined in, helping Han Sen endlessly slay the elites with her arrows.

The elders hadn’t expected a situation like this, and they all sounded furious over what was happening.

“Skysword, I will eat you! And you will never come back,” Illusion Elder roared.

“Save your threats until you escape the mirror,” Han Sen said coldly as he killed another spirit. The Overbearing Shield effortlessly blocked Illusion Elder’s geno core attacks.

Ancient Sky Mirror was good. It could respawn them and their geno cores, so death did not mean much to them.

That seemed very strange to Han Sen. No geno core had endless power. Not even emperor class geno cores could keep respawning indefinitely, like the mirror was currently doing. But there it was, not getting any weaker.

Han Sen wanted to keep on killing and see if he could exhaust the mirror’s power, anyway. But no matter how long he fought, it did not seem to work. The mirror really did seem to have an endless supply of power.

Illusion Elder said, “No matter how strong you and that b*tch are, it’s useless. We are immortal. You will spend all your power eventually. When the time comes, we will eat you alive.”

Many super elites roared and surged out of the mirror. They all looked so angry, wanting to consume Han Sen and Death Goddess. They had the power of the mirror, so they weren’t afraid of dying. It sure gave Han Sen a headache.

And just as Illusion Elder said, Han Sen’s power really was limited. The fight had already cost him a lot of energy, and he had used beast souls. Han Sen didn’t think he could last much more than ten hours, and when he reached the point of exhaustion, he wouldn’t be able to fend them all off anymore.

Death Goddess was in poorer shape, too. She could constantly replenish her arrows, but her wounds kept bleeding. Her recovery speed was most certainly not as good as her attacks.

“Little Silver, heal her wounds!” Han Sen shouted.

Little Star brought Little Silver and Bao’er out from a wall. Little Silver sat on Little Star, showering Death Goddess with his silver lightning.

Death Goddess’ body shook, and she stopped firing the bow. The lightning caused her excruciating pain, but her wounds healed swiftly.

Little Silver’s healing abilities were effective. What sucked was how much it hurt. It wasn’t like ordinary healing powers that only provided relief.

Death Goddess knew Little Silver was healing her, though. She endured the pain and started drawing back her bow again. The power was just as strong, she was just a little slower.

Now that he had healed Death Goddess’ wounds, Han Sen still had to sort out the energy problem. Little Silver was not a pure healer, so he couldn’t replenish a person’s vigor and energy.

Han Sen kept on thinking as he fought. He thought that if he was unable to break the mirror, they could all very well die.

But the Ancient Sky Mirror was far too creepy. Han Sen had looked behind the mirror, and there was nothing strange back there. It was just a silver surface, and there was no power pack or control panel.

“Up until today, the mirror was left unused in this abandoned valley. There must be a reason,” Han Sen thought to himself. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Obviously, Illusion Elder could not control Ancient Sky Mirror. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have placed it there.

“If no one can control the mirror, does that mean it is a geno core owned by no one?” Han Sen’s eyes brightened when that thought crossed his mind.

Han Sen looked around, but he was unable to see anyone actually controlling it. This was something he was very sure about.

“Illusion Elder, do you really think a simple mirror will keep you all alive?” Han Sen directed his speech to Illusion Elder, who was still shouting.

“Ha! Long enough for me to kill you, yes.” Illusion Elder gnashed his teeth as he spoke.

“It is a shame you are unable to control the geno core. I’m sure if you could, you could kill me,” Han Sen went on to say.

“It’s still enough to kill you!” another elder roared.

Han Sen was now certain that they were unable to control the mirror. That fact made him very happy.

If it had been a self geno core, Han Sen didn’t think he could fight it. But it wasn’t, and so that meant Han Sen stood a chance.

Han Sen ignored the screams of the elites and elders, and he found a spot. With his finger, he pointed at the mirror. A drop of blood came out of his finger and landed on the mirror.

Illusion Elder thought Han Sen was trying to break it, so he sneered. “Nothing can hurt the mirror! You’re wasting your time.”

Han Sen ignored him, though. He looked at the drop of blood that planted itself on the mirror as the reflective version of the drop of blood also came against the surface. When the two drops hit each other, they began to spread across the mirror.

Han Sen was very happy about this. He had used his Real Blood geno core into his own blood, then put one drop onto the mirror.

That blood now had Real Blood’s power. If it was not simply canceled by the mirror, it would be absorbed by the item. The mirror would be gifted Han Sen’s power and be wholly controlled by him.

If a geno core like this had a current owner, it would be hard to take. But this one did not have an owner, and so it would be easily taken.

Real Blood wasn’t super obvious, but it was now around the size of a man’s hand. But that soon spread larger and larger, wider and wider. Illusion Elder was very angry with Han Sen and Death Goddess. In his blind rage, he had not noticed the changes occurring to the mirror.

By the time the elites realized that something was happening, the blood had already taken over half of the mirror. The top part was dyed red.

When Illusion Elder noticed the changes in the mirror, he was very shocked. The super elites started to shout, “What’s happening to the mirror? What did he do to the mirror?”
