Chapter 1506: Human Emperor

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Han Sen saw the green gourd, but he did not stare at it. He didn’t want the elder to get the wrong idea.

The gourd looked different than the one Bao’er had come out of, and it felt different, too. Han Sen could not quite put his finger on the reason why, though.

“The Human Emperor and I were connected, in a way. He helped me. How is he now? How have humans been reduced to what they are today?” What the elder said shocked Han Sen.

Han Sen knew the Human Emperor the elder mentioned was the Blood Legion leader that supposedly became a god.

“I don’t know about our elder. I’ve never seen him before, and stories about him aren’t told.” Han Sen shook his head.

The Dark Spirit elder did not think Han Sen was lying, and he just nodded and said, “Back then, all the races believed the Human Emperor became a god. It looks like that might not have been true. If Human Emperor truly became a god, humans wouldn’t be what they are today. Climbing the ranks is the task of an individual, and Human Emperor seems to have fallen. Otherwise, those of his bloodline that are below emperor wouldn’t have to go downstairs.”

This was the first time Han Sen had heard others talk about humans and their apparent ancestors. He wished to talk to the elder some more, so he could learn more about the human ancestors.

But within those few sentences, Han Sen had already received more than a few answers. The story of the human elders was still there in the sanctuary, unlike Asura, who had been forgotten.

“It looks like humans are different than the shura,” Han Sen thought.

The Dark Spirit did not continue talking about this, and instead went on to say, “Take care of Mei’er and I will treat you well. I will give you this as the reward for sending a spirit to look after her.”

After that, the Dark Spirit elder summoned a geno core before Han Sen.

Han Sen saw that it was an old mirror. There was a marking on it, indicating it to be gemstone class. He did not know what it did, but Han Sen accepted it and thanked the elder. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Han Sen understood, though, that this was not a simple reward. It was more of a warning. The words seemed casual, but it was the elder’s way of telling Han Sen that the spirit knew his each and every move. He knew Han Sen had entered the shelter, and he knew he had sent a spirit to watch over Ling Mei’er.

“When Mei’er becomes super class, you will be given even more rewards. Super geno cores are nothing.” After that, the elder waved his hand and had Snake King escort Han Sen out.

After Han Sen left, he noticed he was covered in a cold sweat. The elder was likely stronger than Gu Qingcheng. If the elder wanted Han Sen dead, there’d be no escape.

“Dad, I want the gourd.” Bao’er’s face looked serious.

Han Sen quickly held her mouth closed. He looked around, used the Dongxuan Aura to hide, and asked her, “Do you know what the gourd is?”

Bao’er shook her head. “I don’t know, but it feels important to me.”

“I can’t get it now. The Dark Spirit elder is guarding the gourd. We can’t get it now.” Han Sen knew he was weaker than the elder. An ancient being like that would be far stronger than most emperors.

Bao’er looked depressed, so Han Sen felt guilty. He asked, “Bao’er, do you know when it’ll mature?”

“Maybe in four to five years.” Bao’er looked at Han Sen.

“There’s still time, then. We can find a way to get it,” Han Sen said to comfort her.

But he knew that a few years wouldn’t be long enough to gather enough power to face the entirety of Dark Spirit.

It wasn’t impossible, though. Han Sen thought Gu Qingcheng could rival the elder, and if she could help him, there was a chance he’d be able to get the gourd.

In a few years, perhaps Han Sen himself would reach the level of the elder.

Han Sen stayed in Dark Spirit Shelter for two days, and eventually found a chance to slip away and visit the location where Wang Yuhang was supposed to be.

Han Sen entered a dark alley in the shelter. A man’s voice came out of the dark. “The garden is home to many temptations.”

It was a code, and Han Sen answered it with the password, “So, he cheated.”

“Friend, you have come. I waited a long time for you.” Wang Yuhang came out of the dark and immediately went to clutch Han Sen’s hands.

“To win this revolution, we need to be patient. You must be prepared to make a sacrifice,” Han Sen said righteously.

Wang Yuhang threw his hands away. “F*ck you! You make the sacrifice. I have a few hundred years left in my lifespan, and girls are waiting for me. I’m not sacrificing anything.”

“Young man, you became a demi-god for a few women? You need grander dreams.” Han Sen’s face said he felt sorry for the man.

“Well, otherwise, why would I practice? If it isn’t for the girls, who else? You?” Wang Yuhang smiled.

Han Sen slumped his shoulders and said, “You really are here for the women. By the way, do you have any news on what Spirit Thirteen is up to?”

Wang Yuhang nodded. “Yes. He told me to get close to a Dark Spirit called Ling Mei’er, and follow her whenever she leaves.”

“That Spirit Thirteen really is up to no good. He wants you to follow her so that your unlucky powers doom her by attracting monsters.” Han Sen had already guessed this to be the case, but now he was hearing a confirmation.

“What should I do, then?” Wang Yuhang asked.

“It’s good that you’re doing this. Don’t worry, I’m here.” Han Sen was thinking about how he might get Wang Yuhang out of this. Now that Spirit Thirteen had sent Wang Yuhang here, it made things easier.

Wang Yuhang was so happy. He was worried he’d need to keep staying with Spirit Thirteen.

“Spirit Thirteen is too naive. He has no idea how powerful Uncle really is. He really thinks Uncle is just unlucky, and that’s it.” Han Sen laughed maliciously.

Wang Yuhang discussed matters with Han Sen for a while before leaving.

Spirit Thirteen had all manner of things planned, and Han Sen let them happen. Wang Yuhang approached Ling Mei’er closely and waited for Han Sen to take them all to Mask Shelter.

“By the way, there are other human demi-gods in Dark Spirit Shelter. I called them for a meet-up. Would you like to come?” Wang Yuhang asked Han Sen.

“Where did you hear all this from?” Han Sen looked at him with shock.

“Haha! It is because I am the brother of the president. They respect me a bit more now.” Wang Yuhang laughed.
