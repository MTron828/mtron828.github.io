Chapter 3369 Black Crystal Rain

Blood was everywhere. Wan’er’s shiny god body had a small blood mark.

Suddenly, fire knife airs were coming down to cover the sky and ground to break the gold light that was protecting Wan’er’s body. Many knife airs cut her clothes to impart many small marks on her body.

Although the wounds were not that deep, the fire knife airs were countless in their numbers. More knife airs came raining down, making Wan’er suffer many big hits. She looked more and more wounded as time went by. There was blood on her snow-white, royal-like clothing. The blood looked like flowers.

Seeing Wan’er’s Super God Spirit body be ripped, Han Sen started to feel a bit unsettled. Without really thinking about it, he found himself clutching the Inch Grey Sword tighter. He stared at Wan’er, hoping to see something.

Before Han Sen could see anything, Wan’er’s body looked as if it had just been vaporized. The fire knife airs went through her body. Wan’er’s shadow went through the sea of fire to appear in front of Han Sen. All her wounds were healed, and her clothes were fine. It was as if she had not been harmed at all.

A hand like a knife came slicing down. Wan’er’s shadow had become solid again, but Han Sen was prepared. The Inch Grey Sword was swung. It slashed down and collided with Wan’er’s hand.

Dong!

The Inch Grey Sword and Wan’er’s hand crashed into each other. The indestructible Inch Grey Sword was unable to cut Wan’er’s skinny jade hand that wielded a gold light. Upon their collision, the two of their hits made a golden jade sound.

Han Sen felt as if there was some unstoppable power coming at him very quickly. It made his body fall back into space. His body broke through a lot of blockages and created some kind of air explosion. The force of air exploded all of his clothes, revealing his muscular body.

“That power was Super God Spirit body power.” Han Sen’s eyes looked as if they were on fire. He looked at Wan’er as she adopted a shadow that did not look at all different from Han Sen’s own Super God Spirit body. It was not the skill that was the reverse Super God Spirit body.

“Wan’er has not been able to break the world, so how can she use the Super God Spirit body power?” Han Sen did not understand.

Wan’er did not give him time to think. She was already slashing toward Han Sen again. He waved his sword to fight back. Wan’er’s body became a shadow again. She got close to Han Sen and became solid again. She slashed toward his neck again.

Han Sen seemed to have prepared for this. He entered his own Super God Spirit mode, which made his body become a light shadow that could evade Wan’er’s slash.

Blood spilled like crazy. Han Sen’s neck was delivered a bloody mark. His Super God Spirit body did not dodge Wan’er’s hand slash. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Luckily, Han Sen was just trying this. He was able to dodge the brunt of the attack. She was unable to hit anywhere important. Otherwise, if that slash had been able to unleash its full capacity on him, Han Sen’s head would have definitely been lopped off.

“This is wrong... This is so wrong... Why can Wan’er switch between Super God Spirit mode and the reverse Super God Spirit mode on a whim if she has been unable to break the world?” Han Sen moved quickly. He kept evading Wan’er’s attacks while thinking.

Wan’er, who was able to switch between the two powers freely, had become stronger. On top of that, two of her powers were strong enough to resist Han Sen’s own Super God Spirit mode. Han Sen’s situation had definitely taken a turn for the worse.

Seeing Wan’er slash again, Han Sen had nowhere to fall back to. There was a subtle glint of coldness under Han Sen’s eyelids. The presence of his body changed. There was a very primal, scary power coming out of his body. It generated a sword light on the Inch Grey Sword. It carried a destructive power that was unleashed in Wan’er’s direction.

The reverse version of The Story of Genes power was the scariest type of destructive power there was. With the indestructible Inch Grey Sword and Han Sen’s Super Spank skill, this was going to be the greatest and most powerful attack Han Sen had ever cast.

Katcha!

The Inch Grey Sword struck Wan’er’s hand like a saw striking metal. Sparks erupted everywhere, scattering light all around. If one looked closer, one would notice where the Inch Grey Sword was. It was not actually Wan’er’s hand. Han Sen had aimed at the black crystal ring she was wearing.

Han Sen had been watching Wan’er quite a bit. He sensed something was wrong with her. In the end, he decided to lock onto that ring. Although the ring had never revealed its presence, Han Sen knew for sure there had to be something wrong with it.

Eventually, the black crystal ring was broken by the sword power unleashed via Han Sen’s Inch Grey Sword. It fell off of Qin Wan’er’s finger. It was split in two.

When the black crystal ring shattered and broke, Qin Wan’er looked shocked. She stood where she was in shock. The gold light around her started to go dim. Her blonde hair started to look black.

“Was it discovered so soon? Oh, well. That is fine. He is someone Wan’er is close to. Maybe he knows that already.” Qin Xiu spoke to himself, but his eyes did not shift. It was like he had already expected Han Sen to break the black crystal ring.

“Mister, should we open the portal and take Miss Wan’er back?” Sky King came before Qin Xiu and bowed.

After Wan’er entered Burning Red Sky, she did not trigger the sky-theft fight sequence. Sky King used his 33 skies spirit body and power to send Wan’er to Burning Red Sky.

Aside from Qin Xiu and Sky King, only the people in Burning Red Sky could witness the events unfolding in Burning Red Sky.

“No,” Qin Xiu coldly said. He was still staring at the spirit mirror Sky King had opened. He peered into Burning Red Sky.

Han Sen watched the blonde Wan’er turn back into the black-haired Wan’er. He was feeling happy. Suddenly, the black crystal ring, which had been broken, arose. It did so with a cloud of black smoke. It became a black smoke that drifted toward Wan’er.

“Run!” Han Sen’s eyes and hands were swift. He palmed the black smoke. The hollow structure of the ice-jade field blocked the black smoke’s approach.

Pang!

In the next second, the black smoke broke the ice-jade shield. It went in front of Wan’er and drilled into her mouth.

Han Sen’s looked glum, but it did not seem as if there was anything he could do to stop it. He stopped hesitating and slashed toward Wan’er’s neck. He wanted to stop this entire thing before the black smoke reached her belly.

Wan’er was frozen. Her body strangely fell back. Her movements were very weird. Her body did not move. She went backward like a ghost.

As she slid, Han Sen missed with his Inch Grey Sword. When Han Sen looked at Wan’er’s face, he noticed her eyes were entirely black. She looked scarier than any ghost possibly could. She looked far scarier than the eye color she had before when she was blonde.

Han Sen gripped the Inch Grey Sword. He wanted to swing the sword and attack, but he saw Wan’er sprout two god lights from her back. It tore the clothes on her back like a flying butterfly.

Those two gold and silver god lights were like two wings spreading behind Wan’er’s body. They created a scary spirit light.

“Super God Spirit body and reverse Super God Spirit body exist in the same body, but she has not been able to break the world. Yet, there is no conflict. How is something like this even possible?” Han Sen looked at Wan’er’s sky-shocking sky light wings. His eyes narrowed.
