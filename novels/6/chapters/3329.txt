Chapter 3330 Sheep Jade Body

If things were already this way, Han Sen could not so simply give up right now. If he said he was unable to do it, he did not know if White King or Bottle Fairy would change their disposition and immediately start fighting him.As he cast the Blood-Pulse Sutra, he used the Dongxuan Sutra. He started to analyze the structure of the sheep statue. He wanted to analyze the sheep’s body structure and modify it.Using the Dongxuan Sutra, Han Sen was shocked to find out the sheep jade’s body structure was almost perfect. There weren’t any flaws in its construction. It was like it was Sky God’s work. There was not a single flaw to discern.

“That’s a very powerful body...” Han Sen was very happy.

It was not as if Han Sen had found a way to analyze the sheep’s body. It was just that because the body was so perfect, the Break World rate was probably 95%.

No matter how high the Break World rate was, it did not concern Han Sen. Even if he could see how amazing the body of something was, he could not get anything good out of it.

The sheep’s statue possessed pure jade power. From the structure of its body and jade power, Han Sen was able to get a lot of information out of it.

“If I take a look at the sheep jade’s power structure, it must improve my Jadeskin,” Han Sen thought. He secretly ran his Jadeskin power.

In the past, he had absorbed the white jade building’s jade air to practice his Jadeskin. Those two powers were not the same, but there was a certain jade element. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Han Sen did not completely copy the sheep jade’s elemental structure power. He used a special spot.

The body and power of a Break World creature were combined as one. To research its body meant to research its power. The Dongxuan Sutra could not analyze it in time. He could only analyze one segment of its amazingness. At the same time, he used the Blood-Pulse Sutra to invade the sheep jade’s beautiful body and understand more about it.

Originally, this would be a trying task for Han Sen. Now, this was benefitting him. Han Sen did not want to give up. He revived the sheep but peeping into its power was Han Sen’s true purpose.

The sheep’s body was nearly perfect. Han Sen’s progress was so slow. Even if things were like that, he had a lot to gain.

“This body’s Break World rate is higher than I thought. It is so close to a hundred. There is just a 1% to 20% difference. This one jade fairy leader is quite scary. If White King and the others have a similar level, this sort of power is something I cannot even comprehend. It can certainly compete with the God Chaos Party. Who was this fairy person who was able to create such scary creatures? What sort of power did it have that it could seal away White Jade Jing?” Han Sen’s mind was riddled with questions.

Han Sen’s Jadeskin was holy and pure. The purity was no worse than the sheep, but the sheep’s body had a special structure. The structure of the sheep’s jade body’s mass, strength, and other features were similar to Han Sen’s jade body. Yet, it was tougher than Jadeskin.

Considering this amazing structure’s existence, if the two of them were to do the same attack, the sheep jade body’s attack would be stronger than his.

Han Sen was amazed by this discovery. He kept analyzing the sheep’s jade body. He wanted to break the secrets inside of it. If Jadeskin could use this structure, the Break World rate would increase. He perhaps had a chance to surpass a 30% Break World rate. That would mean his Break World power was solid. It might even lead to him achieving a higher Break World rate.

After all, this was a nearly perfect Break World body. It was very similar to Jadeskin. It was also very rare.

Han Sen kept analyzing it again and again, but he was unable to find the answers he sought. He could not break the structure of the sheep’s body. He could not learn the secrets hidden within its structures.

Blood-Pulse Sutra kept sinking in, but its effects on it were not very good. After two hours, the Blood-Pulse Sutra had only managed to leave behind a red dot that was smaller than a hole left by a needle. That was what was left on the body of the jade sheep statue. One would have needed a pair of binoculars to see it clearly.

That little red dot still made Han Sen go crazy. With the combination of the Dongxuan Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra, it still enabled his Blood-Pulse Sutra’s power to sink in.

Even if it was only a tiny amount, it was enough for Han Sen to learn some secrets about the jade body of the sheep statue. The sheep statue’s jade body structure was not solid. It was empty on the inside.

“A hollow structure?” Han Sen was happy. He did not care how much power this was costing him. He let power go inside him. The hollow structure could increase strength, but that was no longer necessary. The jade sheep’s body secrets were not just there.

Han Sen was quickly able to learn that the sheep’s jade body was not hollow. It resisted the Blood-Pulse Sutra’s power. Han Sen tried his best to sink it in.

Upon seeing Han Sen not making any huge progress, Bottle Fairy frowned and asked, “Mister White King, can you see him?”

White King coldly said, “It is good if it works. If it doesn’t, after his power is spent, it will be easy to capture him. Even if he cannot recover the white sheep fairy, he can help the jade fairy get a body and a will. It will be helpful for the White Jade Jing.

“Mister, you are so smart.” Bottle Fairy understood what White King was thinking. It did not matter if Han Sen could recover the white sheep fairy or not. Either way, it would only be good for them. Nothing bad would come from Han Sen helping them.

Otherwise, Han Sen knew White King would not have been as nice as he was watching. He never planned on spending all of his power. He was going to save enough power to be able to escape from White Jade Jing.

The jade sheep’s secrets made Han Sen change his mind about things. Even if his power was spent, he still wanted to peek at its secrets. If he missed out on this chance, he did not know if he would ever have another.

An almost perfect Break World body creature was just sitting there, letting him research it. Such an opportunity was extremely rare.

Even if Han Sen could kill a high-class Break World creature, it would be pointless. The power of a dead Break World beast would be gone. It would have not been worth doing any research.

At Han Sen’s level, even just a thought would require that a high price be paid. So, Han Sen did not want to risk researching the body.

The Blood-Pulse Sutra and Dongxuan Sutra had combined. A little amount of power sank in. It sank in so slowly, but every little bit was a reward. It shocked Han Sen every time.

“It was not just the structure that was hollow.” Han Sen noticed the jade sheep’s body was not just hollow. There were many changes in the hollow structure.

There was a hexagon structure that was like a beehive. There were also triangular structures. Many hollow structures were combining. Because the sheep’s jade body was like it was dead and not moving, it was hard to find out what those structures did.
