Chapter 1635: Armored Man Again

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Twelve-Winged Dark Seraphim

Dollar had become the most famous person in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, perhaps even the entire universe. Everyone was curious about the true identity of Dollar.

To all the creatures in the Fourth Sanctuary, it didn’t matter who Dollar actually was. They had all concluded that Dollar would definitely make it to the ranks of the ten Son of God’s, and he might even win the entire Divinity’s Bout.

Han Sen didn’t have the time to care about that After he went back to the Alliance, he immediately started to observe Zero, and the more he looked at her, the more he found that she looked like Jade Shura.

“Is Jade Shura Zero’s mother or sister?” Han Sen was thinking. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, he didn’t think it made much sense. Though Zero looked like a little girl, she wasn’t young anymore. Jade Shura might not even have been as old as Zero.

Han Sen thought about it for a while, and he still went to see what he could find about Jade Shura’s identity. She had actually shown her face, and she came from the shura race. She had to have something to do with the Jade Shura family, so it should be fairly easy to find out who she was.

After asking a lot of people, he found the information he wanted. Actually, it wasn’t a difficult job at all. The news that Yu Ming’er lost to Dollar was also important news in the shura race.

Soon, Han Sen learned that Yu Ming’er was indeed someone from the Jade Shura bloodline: she was a daughter of the Shura Queen. However, before the Divinity’s Bout, nobody knew that Yu Ming’er was so powerful.

“A daughter of the Shura Queen? Does that mean Zero might be a daughter of the Shura Queen as well? No way. If she was, why would she look like a human being?” Han Sen felt that the information he had found wasn’t accurate, but he couldn’t figure it out himself.

“I’ll have to look for an answer from the Jade Shura bloodline”, Han Sen thought.

Divinity’s Bout was still going on, but the competitors Han Sen was about to fight all chose to back out. Nobody dared to fight him.

Han Sen went through a very peaceful competition period, but at the same time, another major event happened in the Divinity’s Bout. The Outer Sky leader was defeated by a creature nobody knew, and he was crushed. His body was destroyed with one punch, which shocked everyone in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. It was just as shocking as Han Sen’s defeat of Six Paths.

The master of Outer Sky was a spirit, so he didn’t actually die. Han Sen felt sorry after hearing that. However, being powerful enough to kill the Outer Sky leader did make Han Sen alert. After he heard more about the fight, Han Sen became concerned.

Based on Wang Yuhang’s description, the guy who killed the master of Outer Sky with one punch was mysterious, and Wang Yuhang wasn’t even sure whether it was a spirit or a creature. The being was wearing black armor, and his punch had wielded a fire that was powerful, yet icy cold.

Outer Sky leader’s geno core was frozen, after which it was crushed. He didn’t even have a chance to struggle.

‘The armored man from the Iron Chimenea?’ A terrifying being popped up in Han Sen’s mind after he heard Wang Yuhang’s description. Han Sen’s stomach felt a little upset at the thought.

If it was actually the armored man from the Iron Chimenea, Han Sen couldn’t be guaranteed to defeat him.

Han Sen still remembered the fight between the headless rockman and the black armored man. In Han Sen’s memories, the man in black armor was already much more powerful than many of the strongest beings in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.

Han Sen didn’t think he could kill Outer Sky’s master with only one punch.

Han Sen went to see the fight of the man in black armor in the next round. Though the competitor chose to quit the battle, Han Sen still saw the armored man, and it was indeed the one from the Iron Chimenea.

“Why did he come to join the Divinity’s Bout instead of enjoying his time in the Iron Chimenea?” Han Sen couldn’t understand it.

Han Sen studied the bracket of upcoming fights, and he found that he wouldn’t meet the man in black armor until he became one of the ten Son of God’s. That was relieving.

If he fought the man in black armor and they both got crushed, others would exploit their weakness, and then it would be a tragedy for both of them. Luckily, he would enter the top ten before he had to worry about that.

Because of the armored man, everything was changed now. Everyone thought that Dollar was likely to be the top of the ten Son of God’s, but now people were discussing who was stronger, Dollar or the armored man.

It was bizarre because nobody knew where the armored man came from, so no news was spread. Even other creatures didn’t know that the armored man came from the Iron Chimenea.

“It’s indeed a handful. The headless rockman couldn’t even defeat the armored man with Destiny’s Tower. Can I actually handle him?” Han Sen wasn’t sure either.

Han Sen didn’t run into any trouble in his battles. He went to watch the fights of the armored man several times, but all his competitors conceded as nobody dared to fight him. Everyone knew what had happened to the master of Outer Sky, so none of them were willing to take the risk.

Han Sen took a look at the contestants that the armored man was about to fight. After reading it for a while, he noticed that Gu Qingcheng would run into the armored man before trying to become one of the ten Son of God’s.

“Gu Qingcheng is indeed powerful, but that armored man was just wicked. I’ll try to convince her not to fight.” Han Sen ran back to the shelter to find Gu Qingcheng, and he told her about how he met the armored man and fought him.

“Sister Gu, that armored man is very dangerous, and his power might not even belong in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. Don’t fight him; otherwise, your beautiful face might get injured”, Han Sen said jokingly.

“What? You think I can’t compete with him?” Gu Qingcheng looked at Han Sen, smiling.

“No. I just think he’s like a monster, or a beast. You’re a beautiful woman, so it’s not worth it for you to fight a beast”, said Han Sen.

Gu Qingcheng stopped smiling. She looked at Han Sen and said, “If he’s really from that Iron Chimenea, then there’s more reason for me to meet him.”

“Why so?” asked Han Sen.

“Do you know what that Chimenea is?” Gu Qingcheng didn’t answer Han Sen’s question but asked him one in return.

“How should I know?” Han Sen smiled. If he had known what the Chimenea was, he wouldn’t have messed with it in the first place.

Gu Qingcheng’s facial expression was veiled as she said, “If your description is correct, the Iron Chimenea should be the alchemy pot of a famous Taoist.”

“Are you saying that the Iron Chimenea belonged to an ancient human being?” Han Sen’s eyes popped, and he stared at Gu Qingcheng.
