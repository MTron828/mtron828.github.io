Chapter 2965 Destroyed or Not?

Han Sen looked at the god palaces in space. The whole complex of god palaces was massive. Every god temple was beautiful. They were like the space in a system.Perhaps it was because the big macaque had been destroyed by the God Spirit, but no other creature sought to go into space and battle the God Spirit.

The god palaces were quiet as they hung in space. It seemed as if it was between a real presence and a dream. It was such a big god palace, but it did not take over the real system.

Aside from the thunder god earlier, the doors to the god temples around were closed shut, as was the door to the geno hall high above. It was unknown if God Spirits existed there.

“It is hard to escape chaos. The space barrier has finally been opened by Sacred Leader, but now Sacred Leader is not here. If there is to be a god fight, who can stop the God Spirits from descending?” Sky Palace’s first seat sighed.

Han Sen looked at Sky Palace’s first seat and asked, “What is that supposed to mean?”

Sky Palace’s first seat said, “The god palace is here. They are limited by the rules of the universe, thus they are all trapped in their god temples. They cannot leave their god temples to go kill in the universe.”

“Isn’t that a good thing?” Han Sen asked.

Sky Palace’s first seat shook his head. “It might not be a good thing. Ordinary creatures can pull out the flags and become gods. They can replace the current God Spirits, which can possess the creatures that enter the god temple. That way, they can go throughout the universe and kill. Right now, a sky full of God Spirits have closed their temples. If more creatures attempt to challenge them and incite their ire, and if they possess the creatures of the universe to enter the universe, there will be chaos.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Back in the day, Sacred forced the god palaces to reveal themselves. Many scary elites queued up to slay the God Spirits, so the God Spirits had to fight back. A sky full of God Spirits possesses people when they descended. That was how they broke Sacred. They turned it into the big barren system you now know. Luckily, back then, Sacred was very strong. The God Spirits that possessed people were killed. They saved the universe. Now, Sacred Leader is no more. In this universe, no faction is as strong as Sacred used to be. If a sky full of God Spirits descends, who can stop them? The universe will surely be doomed.”

The demon lady forced her body to crawl up off the ground. She casually said, “You are all talking crap. Stop the god palaces appearing and stop killing God Spirits? Then, how can I be unbound from the universe’s laws? Only by killing these God Spirits and getting a God Spirit personality armament to make ourselves stronger can we achieve our freedom. We will not be bound to the whims of the God Spirits. We just need to get stronger. We do not have to be afraid of those God Spirits. People say they are afraid of the God Spirits descending to destroy the world, but that is just an excuse made by the scared and useless people.”

Sky Palace’s first seat harshly said, “The world has rules. The universe needs rules so everyone can operate and function normally. If you break those rules, the universe’s rules will fall apart. Then, things will descend into chaos.”

“If we do not break it, nothing will change,” Old Vulture said. “We need to break rules to make our own rules. We should be able to control our own fate.”

The two of them shared a different opinion, and neither could convince the other to see things their way.

Nine Thousand King brought the goldfish family with him and ran over to join everyone. He politely bowed before Han Sen. “Mister.”

Han Sen pointed at the heavily injured demon lady, Old Vulture, eyeless beast, and Red Ghost. “Tie them all up and take them away. Old Cat can trade their lives for my son.”

“There is no need to go to such trouble, Mister,” the demon lady said with a smile. “If you were chosen by the master of yore, we will help you with all our might. We will do whatever it takes to destroy the sky full of God Spirits and accomplish your mission. Our lives now belong to you. If you wish to see us dead, all you have to do is say the word.”

After pausing, the demon lady went on to say, “If it is not like that, I must still say that taking us as hostages is pointless. Old Cat would be willing to sacrifice anything for Littleflower. He will not give up Little Master for our lives. Mister, you do not have to worry. With Sacred Leader’s word, Old Cat will give Little Master back to you.”

Sky Palace’s first seat suddenly stopped the demon lady from speaking. He said to Han Sen, “If you can use Under the Sky Knife skills, you must be associated with Sky Palace. There is something we used to say. I hope you consider it. The universe’s rules cannot be broken. The god palace cannot be destroyed. Otherwise, there will be chaos in the universe.”

“Mister, do not listen to his nonsense,” the demon lady immediately said. “When you kill the sky full of God Spirits that come raining down on the universe, you will be the one to conduct the rules of this universe. Who would dare mess that up?”

Sky Palace’s first seat wanted to say something, but Han Sen waved his hand and stopped him. “Because Sky Palace Leader was nice to me, I do not want to trouble you. Let’s just pretend whatever happened did not happen. You should go.”

“Please think about it,” Sky Palace’s first seat said. He sensed that Han Sen had not changed his mind. He sighed, turned around, and left.

“Mister, he knows so many secrets about the holy palace,” Old Vulture said. “He must be a spy sent by one of the God Spirits. You cannot leave him alive.”

Han Sen coldly looked at Old Vulture. “Sacred Leader is Sacred Leader, and I am just me. I am not your master, and I will not do whatever it is your master wants me to do. Take them all away.”

The last sentence was spoken by Han Sen to Nine Thousand King.

Nine Thousand King looked a little hesitant, but Han Sen had spoken the command so surely. He did not dare disobey Han Sen, so he tied up the demon lady and the others.

The demon lady and the others did not resist. They looked as if they accepted it. Nine Thousand King easily tied them up.

The eyeless big beast said, “No matter what you want us to do, we will do it. We will do anything.” His voice sounded like it was buzzing.

Han Sen had a wry smile. He knew the demon lady and the others were not loyal to him. They were only loyal to Qin Xiu.

Han Sen thought, “It is no wonder Qin Xiu was the best of his generation. Even though he died, so many top-class creatures died due to his words. That guy’s charms are unfathomable.”

Han Sen planned on returning to Space Garden to think about these matters because he now understood a great deal more. He still did not know what the origin was. There was still a lot he had yet to figure out. He did not want to make any rash decisions just yet.

With Qin Xiu’s power, living forever was too easy for him. If one were discussing freedom, as long as he did not do anything stupid, the sky full of God Spirits would not go and annoy him.

Qin Xiu had decided to fight the God Spirits, and there had to be a reason for that.

Han Sen thought Sky Palace’s first seat’s speech had been nonsense. If there were no rules, nothing would be complete. Before he figured out if he could break the rules and what the consequences would be for doing that, he was not willing to fight blindly.

“God, what is that supposed to mean?” Han Sen looked at the god palace’s highest geno hall. He thought about the god Wan’er had been possessed by.

Han Sen was unable to understand what that God did.

Suddenly, Han Sen’s eyes turned bright. In the geno hall’s god temple plaza, he saw a golden statue.

No, it was more like a golden statue, but it was not a statue. It was Golden Growler, who had previously entered the geno hall.
