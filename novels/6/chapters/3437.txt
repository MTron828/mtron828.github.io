Chapter 3438 Ten Thousand Race Articles

“Qin Xiu was consumed by another guy to become something even scarier,” Crape Myrtle said. “If Bao’er can successfully combine with the gene seed, she might be able to defeat Qin Xiu. Currently, if she wants to beat that guy, there is likely only a 50% chance she can succeed. And that is my most hopeful estimate.”

“What? Did that actually happen? Who managed to consume Qin Xiu?” Han Sen could not believe a person like Qin Xiu had been consumed by someone else.

“I do not have time to explain it to you. There is not much more time I can give you. If that guy really manages to take that step, it will be fine if he goes for a way that is different from what Qin Xiu had planned. If this new felon goes down the same route, the damage dealt with the universe will be even greater. So, I will need you to control your body as fast as possible. That way, maybe you will be able to beat him.” After Crape Myrtle said that, he put his hands together and shouted, “Go! You should experience the miracle of the geno hall!”

The geno hall’s god light came beaming out. It created a weird vortex that sucked Han Sen’s body into it.

“I say, Big Brother, I do not want to visit your geno hall. I want to fight that guy now.” Han Sen tried his best to resist the suction, but it did not work. The geno hall’s door covered the sky and the ground. Somehow, his body was sucked into the door.

Boom!

The open door disappeared. The god light in the battleground vanished.

The elites watching finally had their vision return. They noticed that only Crape Myrtle remained on the battlefield of the 33 skies. Han Sen was gone.

“San Mu lost!” Tang Zhenliu’s face changed.

On the geno tablet, Han Sen’s name was erased. Only Crape Myrtle’s remained, so it was fairly obvious that Han Sen had lost the bout.

Ji Yanran’s face went so white that it looked as if she had no blood in her body. It was fine if he lost and came home, but for him to die would be extremely dire.

“Han Sen only relied on the sacrifices of others to reach that step. When push comes to show, his true colors show through.”

“I thought God of Wealth was awesome. Was that all he was able to do?”

In the universe of kingdoms, many people were happy about the results. The geno universe, on the other hand, remained dead silent. No one could believe Han Sen had just lost like that.

Another fight that went from four to two pitted Ancient Devil against Human King. Ancient Devil defeated big sky demon to move forward and do combat with Human King.

Human King looked at Ancient Devil and said, “Ancient Devil, you are God Chaos Party’s vice president. Bury Path God chose to fight Qin Xiu, and Qin Xiu killed him with one hand. Do you want to replicate Bury Path God’s demise?”

“Did you beat Qin Xiu?” Ancient Devil frowned. He had always thought he would end up fighting Qin Xiu.

“Kind of,” Human King said with a smile. “Tell me, what are you going to do?”.

“If I have already come this far, so there is no reason why I should turn back now.” Ancient Devil looked at Human King as he spoke.

“Do you think you are stronger than Qin Xiu?” Human King looked at Ancient Devil with interest.

“I am not stronger than Qin Xiu, but I am a bit stubborn,” Ancient Devil said. “If I don’t hit a wall, I don’t turn away. I must try it.”

“If you leave now, I can keep you alive. If you fight, I will kill you. What is your final decision?” Human King quietly spoke. It was like he was having a chat with an old friend. In fact, he did not have much of a connection with Ancient Devil.

“Did I not already tell you that I am stubborn? I do not turn away if I do not hit a wall. To me, there is no other choice. Either that or God already decided on my path on my behalf.”

Ancient Devil said that, he clenched his fists.

Han Sen was sucked through the geno hall’s door by a strong force of suction. In the past, he had always been able to stand outside the door and see the 10,000 race lanterns burning within. He had also managed to light a lantern for the crystallizer race. This, however, was the first time he had ever set foot inside the geno hall.

After going into the geno hall, the first thing he saw was the 10,000 race lanterns. The 10,000 race lanterns were organized on both sides of the hall. It gave people a strange feeling. It was like the lights on either side were guiding one’s way through hell. It looked very scary.

“The higher races think their race lanterns are inside the geno hall, but they do not know their race lanterns are like street lamps. They do not receive much respect. It is fortunate they are not just trampled.” Han Sen walked past the race lanterns. The geno hall was very weird. There was a big hall. When Han Sen stood beyond the door, he could not see the end of the hall. There were just two sides of the race lanterns guiding the path forward.

The geno hall door was closed. Han Sen was unable to go back. He had to follow the race lanterns and go forward to see exactly what it was that Mister God wanted him to see.

“He said there is something I need here, so I wonder what that is.” Han Sen did not want to slow down, so he accelerated his pace and went faster.

The 10,000 race lanterns were shining at a distance that was not too far away from him. Han Sen did not have to walk for long before seeing the end of the race lanterns. There was a wall at the end of the race lanterns.

The wall was made from an old jade carving. It was quite strange. Han Sen looked at it, but he could not see the end of the wall. He also could not see the beginning of the wall. It was like the jade wall extended forever.

The weirder thing was that the wall had no end. Even so, Han Sen saw everything that was carved into the jade wall. The feelings were too weird to describe. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The jade wall had a lot of text. When Han Sen continued to examine it, he saw the familiar text, such as the words Crystallizer, Sky, Buddha, and other stuff.

Clearly, they were the higher races that had lit up lanterns inside the geno hall. Han Sen was most curious about the fact that the jade wall had more than 10,000 words.

As Han Sen examined it for a while, he eventually caught sight of a familiar word: Feather. Han Sen remembered that the Feather race had been kicked out of the higher races by Kong Fei. Why would the Feather still be featured on the jade wall?

“Does this mean that whoever becomes a higher race can forever remain on this jade wall?” Han Sen looked around. He saw many familiar and strange texts, but he never once saw the word human. That made him sad.

“Stop looking! There aren’t any humans on the jade wall.” A voice sounded in Han Sen’s ear. A familiar shadow appeared on the jade wall. It was standing next to Han Sen.

“It is you. Who was that in the 33 skies arena?” When he saw this person, Han Sen was given a shock. It was the Mister God he used to know.
