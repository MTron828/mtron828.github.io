2129 Final Figh

Xie Qing King was too severely injured and too exhausted to continue in the geno rank fights, so he ended up placing in the top eight. The people that watched him and Odoga fight, however, were of the firm belief that one of those two should have taken first place. Unfortunately, the two powerhouses had ended up against each other far too soon. One was defeated and beaten into a sorry state, and the other was victorious but also beaten into a sorry state.

The ranked fights continued with some surprising results. On the fourth match of the King tier, Yisha actually ended up losing, which surprised her many fans. Her final position rested at rank number four.

Han Sen wasn’t there to watch the fight, so he was unsure what had led to her defeat. That being said, according to what he had heard, something strange occurred during the bout.

Han Littleflower got to his final fight easily. His Sacred powers allowed him to manipulate space and time, and no Viscount was able to challenge that technique in the field of battle.

No one was stronger than Han Littleflower, so it was highly likely that he would gain the number one position after completing his final fight.

If not for Evil Eye, Han Sen would have been a shoo-in for winning the entire Marquise tier bracket. But alas, it was not so. With Evil Eye being there, there was no guarantee that Han Sen would be victorious.

Han Sen had watched Evil Eye’s fights with intense focus. The man looked frightening, but Han Sen thought there was something off about him. What that was precisely, Han Sen could not put his finger on. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Han Sen called Yisha to highlight his concern. He wanted to comfort her after her loss, too.

“My Queen, I will come to Narrow Moon and visit you in just a few short days.”

Yisha sat on her throne with her long white legs crossed comfortably before her. She looked at Han Sen through the video feed, smiled, and said, “You are coming back to comfort me?”

“No. You are the strongest woman of all. You simply missed and that’s it.” Han Sen’s comforting skills already seemed to be lacking.

Yisha still smiled, and she looked at Han Sen. “The Meka made a generous offer in exchange for their win. We have what we need now. Did you honestly believe I would lose?”

Han Sen was surprised by this revelation. That was not what he had expected from Yisha at all.

Yisha continued to smile and said, “The Rebate are a high race, but we are not like Sky Palace. We don’t have anyone deified. We need to grow a great deal to remain competitive. So, we had to give up something. That was just how it had to be.”

Han Sen understood that she had allowed herself to lose despite her ardent desire to win. She had not lost to a genuine enemy in battle; she had lost to politics.

“Go back to Sky Palace. These matters aren’t your concern. You need to level up and become a King. Only then can you play these games. Right now, you aren’t even a spare piece on the table of play,” Yisha said, then abruptly hung up the phone.

Han Sen knew that his level was still too low. The Story of Genes was too difficult, and he repeatedly mulled the idea of just giving it up. He could level up his other three geno arts to the rank of King instead.

The final fight for the Marquise tier was about to start, and Dollar and Evil Eye’s names were on the tip of every tongue. It was the hottest topic of the day.

Although Han Sen had shown powerful attacks, Dragon Eight was the only opponent that he had defeated with true raw power. Lone Bamboo’s non-fight had also disappointed a great many people.

Evil Eye’s track record over multiple lives was too impressive, so most people thought that Evil Eye would be the one to win the fight. After all, Evil Eye had been deified many times before, and so he was the sort to see things differently. This point alone made him the likeliest candidate for victory.

Still, it was not all doom and gloom in Dollar’s corner. Many nobles still placed their faith in him becoming victorious. They loved Coin. Up until now, at least, Dollar had proved that Coin could defeat anything. Many people loved it.

At a gambling station located on a certain planet, a dirtbike pulled up. The man who rode it came inside and dropped a heavy bag on the table. When the workers opened the bag, their eyebrows rose and wide smiles spread across their faces. One of them quickly said, “Dear customer, who are you placing your money and faith in?”

“What’s the winning forecast look like for Dollar?” the man asked.

“1.84,” the worker answered. Then, he looked at the man with the dirtbike strangely.

Most people believed Evil Eye would win, so there was no way he’d be forecasted to lose. Nobody put their bets on Dollar.

“I bet that Dollar will win,” the man said as he straightened his sunglasses.

If the man was willing to give away a sack of free money, then none of the workers would turn him down. The worker cashed it in and gave the man a receipt.

“Dumb*ss. He put all of his money on Dollar winning. The whole universe knows Evil Eye won’t lose,” the worker said, upon seeing the man with a motorbike take his leave.

Wang Yuhang safely pocketed the receipt and went on his merry way to a xenogeneic hunting zone.

When the final fight began, everyone was able to watch it. Only two other creatures were still engaged in fights of their own.

In the past, the most famous and well-attended fights would always take place in the King tier. But this year, things were different. Marquises and Viscounts had received a lot of attention this time around, particularly the Marquises. Because of Dollar and Evil Eye, that tier of fights received more attention than King class fights.

The Viscount tier received the focus it did because of Littleflower and little else. But even then, there was nothing much to watch in his fights. It wasn’t as if people believed any other Viscount could defeat Littleflower, who wielded those Sacred powers.

“It’s going to start! I wonder how long Dollar will be able to last against Evil Eye.” Dragon Eight and Dragon Nine were keenly watching the Geno Being Scroll flash. Their attention was focused on the Marquise final fight’s battleground.

“If Brother Bamboo had not gone missing, it would be him battling Evil Eye.” In Sky Palace, Thousand Feather Crane could not help but sigh.

Everyone was focusing on that fight now, and that was especially true of the research organizations. They were extremely interested in Coin and Evil Eye. Not even deified elites could live forever, but Evil Eye had been reborn repeatedly. Everyone wished to know his secret to immortality.

“I hope Dollar lasts as long as possible to draw out the secrets that enshroud Evil Eye.” Sky Path Garden’s leader was keenly watching the Geno Being Scroll.

“Between Coin and Evil Eye’s secrets, we’re bound to learn something today,” a researcher said.

“I want to see Evil Eye’s secret of rebirth,” the Sky Path Garden leader coldly repeated.
