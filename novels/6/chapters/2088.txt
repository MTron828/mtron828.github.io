Chapter 2089 Suppress Evil Technique

Han Sen did not know what a “geno being scroll” was. After Han Sen asked Yu Jing, he learned that it was a treasure from the geno hall. It appeared in the geno hall once a century, and any race could compete for it. They could test themselves inside.

Geno being scrolls would place the names of the top ten thousand on it, individually organized from best to worst. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The entire geno universe would be able to see the names sorted on the being scrolls.

“If I leave my name on this thing, what benefit is there?” Han Sen asked Yu Jing.

“Fame throughout the entire geno universe. Everyone will see your name and your race; won’t that be a benefit? With your power, you’re guaranteed to hit the top out of Earls and Marquises. If you are in the top ten, you’ll be so famous.” Yu Jing did not know if Han Sen was an Earl or Marquise, and that’s why he worded things the way he did.

“Not interested,” Han Sen said flatly. He would gain nothing by participating, and fame was the last thing he wanted.

“Do not turn me down quite so soon, Brother Han. There is still a year until the event, so perhaps you will change your mind by then.” Yu Jing didn’t keep trying to convince him, but he moved on to ask, “Brother Han? When are you going to do a lecture on geno arts? Many students are waiting. Can you tell me what you’re going to say when you do one?”

“What would you like to hear?” Han Sen had already planned to complete his yearly teaching requirement while he was free. He could spare ten days right now, so he might as well get it done.

The only problem was that Han Sen didn’t know what he should lecture on. He couldn’t just teach Under the Sky to the public, either.

Sky Palace had people that studied all types of geno arts. Whatever Han Sen spoke about, there were bound to be some students that had no interest in what he’d discuss.

And the Sky Palace students would never have seen anything like his sanctuary-based geno arts. Trying to teach those would be pointless.

“If you can, I would like you to talk about the Thirty-Three Days Sutra. But that is, of course, the base geno art of all Sky. I doubt you have learned it,” Yu Jing said.

Yeah, I really haven’t,” Han Sen said with a wry smile.

Yu Jing thought, and then his eyes lit up. “Okay, if you can, are you able to talk about Suppress Evil?”

“Suppress Evil?” Han Sen had never heard that name before. He came to Sky Palace for the White Jade Jing and his own geno arts. He didn’t bother learning anything else. He only knew about a few of the famous ones, like Textless Book and Phenomenon.

“Suppress Evil is a famous geno art. It is regarded as quite the skill here in Sky Palace. Everyone can learn Suppress Evil, too. Unlike Textless Book, that only a handful of students can learn,” Yu Jing said.

“Everyone can practice that skill? That is too much.” Han Sen knew that anything that freely available would be lame. The best skills were usually something only a select few could learn. Skills that were too generally used, even if they were great, would only become worse over time.

Yu Jing said, “Suppress Evil is a secret skill of the palace. All Sky can learn it, but outsiders are required to prove themselves before studying it. The technique is strong, but it is very difficult to learn. There are eleven tiers to it, as well. An ordinary student is doing well if they can reach the third or fourth tier, and I myself—who focused on it for many years—only managed to reach the fifth tier. I don’t know when I’ll hit the sixth. I would appreciate it if you could talk about this. I’m sure much of Sky Palace would appreciate it.”

“Let me think about it. What is the Suppress Evil skill, anyway?” Han Sen asked quietly.

Han Sen still had permission to go to the holy house. If Suppress Evil suited him, he supposed he could learn it. Yu Jing quickly explained the skill to Han Sen, hoping to spark his interest.

After Han Sen heard what it was, he chuckled. “If I start learning it now, I don’t know when I’ll be ready to hit the stage. This geno art is too complicated, and it is unlikely I’ll be able to learn it in a single day.”

Suppress Evil was complicated, and he couldn’t just learn it on a whim. Out of all the elites in Sky Palace, the only one who had fulfilled all eleven tiers was the Sky Palace leader himself. Well, the only person that was still alive, at least.

Yu Jing said Suppress Evil had a textbook of thirty-million words. It would take a long time to read it, and even longer to practice. Spending one whole year getting to the first tier was considered the average. It’d take him a few years if he was to make a speech about it.

“That is what I was expecting. Suppress Evil is indeed too difficult. I have no teacher, and it is too hard to learn.” Yu Jing had a wry smile.

After Yu Jing was gone, Han Sen decided to go to the holy house. He used the last opportunity he had to nab a copy of Suppress Evil. Any of the Sky could learn it, but if an outsider wanted to, they would have to commit to doing a good deed.

Han Sen didn’t get this geno art so he could lecture on it, though. He developed a personal interest in the skill after hearing what Yu Jing had to say.

Suppress Evil did not deal damage. Its power was focused on suppression. It was a rare Seal geno art. The Turtle technique, which Han Sen had created, was also a Seal geno art. And that had proven useful.

After finishing Turtle, Han Sen had found himself pining for another Seal geno art. Up until now, he had yet to find one.

That skill could be used from a Baron to a deified elite. When your own body became stronger, the technique became better, too. It was very effective when you were deified, and so it was hard to find a skill like that.

The skill was split into a book for each tier, and most people could only take one at a time. This rule was intended to prohibit leaks. Fortunately, Han Sen was given permission to take all eleven of them by the Sky Palace leader.

After returning to his island, he started reading through the content thoroughly. It took him a few days to read it all, and it was lucky Han Sen had a good memory. If he forgot what came first, it’d all have been for nothing.

“This is a powerful geno art.” After Han Sen read it, he found himself starting to like it a whole lot more.
