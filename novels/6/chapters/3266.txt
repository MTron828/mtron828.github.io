Chapter 3267 Mud Man

Han Sen and the old man, in their mud-man shape, were on the table. They looked like two inanimate objects. One would never have thought that they were two grand elites who were once very scary and famous.

After doing that, Zhao Ning’er took out a mirror. The mirror displayed Bury Path God’s image.

Zhao Ning’er looked into the mirror and spoke to Bury Path God. “Bury Path God, according to the deal we struck, Han Sen has already been captured. Where is the gene egg you promised me?”

Bury Path God looked at the mud man on the table and coldly said, “It is no wonder why you will become the singing queen. You are becoming more and more powerful. You did not just capture Han Sen. Even the freak of the White family was captured too. Well done.”

After pausing, Bury Path God said, “Bring them to the 33 skies. You will then be given the gene egg as your reward.”

“Bury Path God, do you think I, Zhao Ning’er, am a mere three-year-old child?” Zhao Ning’er laughed coldly. “I will bring them to the Zhao Kingdom. I will use the old man as a sacrifice for the soul of the Zhao Kingdom. If you want Han Sen, bring the gene egg to the Zhao Kingdom.”

After that, Zhao Ning’er put the mirror down on the table. The image of the man on the other end disappeared.

The old man and Han Sen went to the Red Sleeve Building and did not come back. That became a point of focus for a lot of people in Jade Wall City. They guessed what might have happened behind the closed doors of the Red Sleeve Building.

When Zhao Ning’er finished her tour and left Jade Wall City, Han Sen and the old man had yet to show up again.

If Zhao Ning’er was able to hurt Han Sen and the old man, it would have been the basis of a tale no one could have reasonably believed. Not even mentioning the White family’s freak, the old man, but Zhao Ning’er could certainly not deal with the horrendous power someone like Han Sen wielded.

Han Sen’s reputation in the Qin Kingdom was quite awful, but no one was willing to deny that Han Sen was powerful.

Of course, many of the Qin Kingdom’s people wanted Han Sen to vanish. They wanted him to die and never come back again.

When Zhao Ning’er left the Qin Kingdom, royal guards stopped her ship from leaving. After a lengthy search, they were unable to find a trace of Han Sen or the old man from the White family.

A teacher of the Qin Kingdom and a famous noble of the Qin Kingdom had vanished without a trace. Zhao Ning’er, who was the most suspicious suspect, could not get away from the Qin Kingdom so easily.

It was a shame that Han Sen and the old man were not very well-liked in the Qin Kingdom. Someone in the Qin Kingdom enabled Zhao Ning’er to leave the Qin Kingdom. By the time Qin Jing Zhen noticed she was gone, it was too late to stop her.

Qin Jing Zhen knew this was not just about Han Sen. It was also about him. He was a dying king, so being mad would not fix anything. He had to send his trusted men after Zhao Ning’er. Despite that effort, they could not catch up to her.

Although Zhao Ning’er was not a royal of the Zhao Kingdom, she was still a famous person from there. There was even a planet named after Zhao Ning’er. Her home was situated on that planet.

Half of that planet belonged to Zhao Ning’er. She had a castle that was situated on an island in the center of an ocean. Without Zhao Ning’er’s explicit permission, no one else was allowed to set foot on that island. Only a few maids were able to go there to perform some cleaning tasks. Even that was rarely done.

In a pavilion on that island, two mud men looked very alive. One of them was shaking like mad. Suddenly, there was a “pang” sound. One of the mud men turned into a person. “It looks like a test subject like Zhao Ning’er is not controlled by Qin Xiu completely. She just made a deal with the God Chaos Party.” Han Sen already knew Zhao Ning’er was a bit strange, so he deliberately allowed himself to be tricked and captured by her. He wanted to learn a few secrets.

Han Sen was ultimately disappointed. Zhao Ning’er did not know much in the way of deep secrets. She was just a test subject for the God Chaos Party. She was not even a member of the God Chaos Party.

Han Sen pulled an item out of his pocket. It was the Ultimate Egg that belonged to the old man.

Han Sen wanted to wait a bit longer to see what the God Chaos Party would do to Zhao Ning’er, but that Ultimate Egg brought trouble. Han Sen had to break Zhao Ning’er’s power and become his true self again.

The Ultimate Egg’s tai chi symbol started to move. A weird power was forming in Han Sen’s chest. It came out from the Ultimate Egg and entered his body. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

That power was very weird. Even with Han Sen’s strength, he could not stop that power from developing. That power also seemed a bit familiar.

It was quite similar to the weird power Han Sen endured against on the planet that contained the ice jade evil lady, but it was still different.

“Is this Ultimate Egg related to the ice jade evil lady’s birthplace?” Han Sen wondered as he stared at the Ultimate Egg.

The Ultimate Egg was releasing a weird power. If it was not for Han Sen’s Dongxuan Sutra power and sensitive nature, he would not have been able to discern the presence of that power.

That weird power came out of the Ultimate Egg and went into Han Sen’s body. Up until now, he had been unable to find out what the weird power did.

It was like the power went into his body, melted, and disappeared. It did not do any harm to his body. Nothing weird happened. Han Sen still felt as if something was wrong. Some unknown powers were inside his body. It was not a good thing.

Han Sen tried using a few powers. They could not work against the Ultimate Egg’s power that had now taken root inside his body. He had to summon Spell again.

Of course, after he combined with Spell, that weird power stopped going into his body. The Ultimate Egg’s power. The tai chi symbol stopped running too.

Han Sen wanted to investigate the Ultimate Egg further, but he heard a voice come from behind a door. It made Han Sen’s heart jump. He canceled his combination and used the Dongxuan Sutra to simulate Zhao Ning’er’s power. He became a mud man once more and returned to the table. He did not move an inch.

“Sister, this is the Qin Kingdom’s No. 1 swordsman. It is Han Sen, who broke Jade Wall City. He looks very ordinary, does he not?” A girl who looked exactly like Zhao Ning’er picked up Han Sen, who looked like a mud man, and examined him. Zhao Ning’er laughed. “Han Sen is strong, but a strong power does not make someone invincible. Power must be used correctly and in the right place.”

“Big Sister, I want to break the world too,” the girl said as she happily looked at Zhao Ning’er. “What is that life soul you have? Can you get me one too?”

Zhao Ning’er shook her head. “The God Chaos Party will trick your mind. They did not give me the life soul out of the goodness of their hearts. If it was not for the situation, I would not have accepted the life soul. Please, do not try and do what I have done.”

“Whatever. You are always like that, Big Sister.” The girl left in a sulky mood.

Zhao Ning’er stopped the girl and said, “Leave the mud man.”

“The God Chaos Party people are not here yet. Let me play with it for a while.” The girl stuck her tongue out. She departed with the Han Sen mud man in hand.
