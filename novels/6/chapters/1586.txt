Chapter 1587: Death Goddess

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Ghost Eye had already schemed what to do, and as soon as the deal was done, he contacted the buyer. But as soon as he made contact with the person, he lost his first rank position.

“Ghost Eye, are you trying to trick me again?” The spirit that wished to make a trade with Ghost Eye spoke with a cold tone of voice.

“No... I... What the f*ck happened?” Ghost Eye looked disheartened. He had been super quick, so how could someone have already usurped his position?

“Does this have something to do with that guy?” Ghost Eye saw that the first rank was now occupied by Bulwark Umbrella. He kept thinking about it, and soon, a chill ran down his spine.

If both of those geno cores did belong to Han Sen, Ghost Eye couldn’t fathom how powerful he might have been. He must have had many geno cores that could reach first place through the testing.

Ghost Eye didn’t dare think it was all the machination of one person, however. He thought the cores must have belonged to a faction. No one would have expected all those geno cores to be owned by one individual.

Han Sen used Bulwark Umbrella to achieve first place and immediately claim the nine reinforcements. He used Gold Core lights to then push it up to a gold class geno core.

Then, Ghost Eye noticed he was back in first place. This brought back his cheer, and he said, “Haha! It looks like the umbrella’s master was testing at a bad time. He must have leveled it up to gold straight away after reinforcing it nine times. It looks like my luck is still here!”

Ghost Eye contacted the buyer spirit again, wanting to sell off his position, but when they established the time and place to do so, the geno core leaderboard started to shine. The rankings changed again.

Ghost Eye felt awful. It was like sitting on a rollercoaster of emotions. With the constants twists and turns, he felt as if his heart was going to explode.

“Ghost Eye, what is the meaning of this?” The spirit was maddened. He stared at Ghost Eye with eyes filled with anger.

Ghost Eye was depressed. He opened his mouth but found himself at a loss for words.

Coin had achieved first place in the geno core storage. It was a huge shock, and everyone in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary was starting to think it might have belonged to the Almighty Dollar that had managed to fell the Destroyer Wolf.

If they were related, and it was only a silver geno core that had been used to destroy Destroyer Wolf, its might was frightening to think about.

Some creatures believed the Coin geno core had to be the geno core that toppled Destroyer Wolf. Some thought they weren’t related. It was quite the argument.

Some people couldn’t wait to challenge Coin’s master to see if the geno core did indeed belong to Dollar.

Han Sen didn’t care much for that, though. He accepted his first rank and just left without agreeing to any of the proposed matches. Afterwards, though, Han Sen did not level up Coin to gold. He was planning on using it on Ghost Eye.

Crystal Core, Real Blood, and Bulwark Umbrella were now gold class. He’d be reaching the bottleneck once they leveled up again, as getting them up through the ranks of super would be difficult.

Han Sen absorbed the Life Geno Essence from Destroyer Wolf. He received eight super geno points from it, bringing his total tally of such points to thirty-four.

Han Sen’s body had gotten considerably stronger. What he needed to focus on now, primarily, was how he might max out his super geno points.

Han Sen had the power necessary to kill super creatures, but there weren’t many out there that were solo. Most super creatures belonged to proper super shelters, and so finding an appropriate target would be arduous work.

As Han Sen wondered where he might be able to find and kill a super creature, Lady Chef returned to the shelter with shocking news.

She said Outer Sky Shelter had attracted the ire of something most fearsome. Many super creatures and spirits had been killed, leaving them damaged and vulnerable.

“Who did that? This sounds great.” Han Sen heard this and beamed a smile. He was planning on taking down Outer Sky once he got strong enough, anyway.

“No one knows where the creature came from, as no one has seen her before. She was a creature that wielded a bow. She wore black armor and had black wings. She looked as if she had come from Sacred, but she hadn’t. She was as powerful as Sacred’s leader, though. Even the Outer Sky leader was incapable of fighting her off.” Lady Chef detailed the events that had occurred.

Han Sen was shocked. He thought the creature she mentioned might have been the woman from the Sacred egg.

But the woman didn’t seem that strong when he saw her. Destroyer Wolf had sucked her blood dry. How could she emerge so quickly, appearing healthy and stronger than ever? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Han Sen quickly asked, “The creature you mentioned, was she around 1.8m tall? Were the black wings like the wings of a raven? Did her armor look like this...”

Han Sen drew her armor as best as he could from memory. Lady Chef saw it and was surprised. She said, “You saw her!”

Han Sen’s head was in a right mess now, and he thought to himself, “Undoubtedly, she is the woman from the Sacred egg. But what happened to save her life and make her strong?”

Han Sen didn’t realize that a part of his strength was included.

“The creature is that strong?” Gu Qingcheng came in, asking. She had heard the conversation.

“Yes, she is that strong. If the spirits were unable to revive in Outer Sky, the shelter should be empty right now. Her mode of operation is one arrow, one kill. Super creatures and king spirits are both killed in a single strike. Only Outer Sky’s leader and a few of their elites were able to survive an arrow. I am sure the Fourth God’s Sanctuary is all in shock over this. No one even knows her name; everyone just calls her Reaper or Death Goddess. If she gets angry, she will kill everyone she wants to without speaking a single word.” Lady Chef sounded jealous.

She wanted to be able to do the same thing, too. If she could, obtaining ingredients would be much easier. Leveling up was hard, and thus far, she had only reached gemstone class.

“Death Goddess...” Han Sen’s expression was reserved. He repeatedly tapped his head in thought.

Han Sen was sure it was the woman from the Sacred egg, but the woman did not go to Sacred or Destroyer Empress. She had been searching for something, but what that was, Han Sen did not know.
