Chapter 3273 Zhao Ning’er’s Makeover

The power of the Xuan Yellow Sutra hit Zhao Ning’er. It made Han Sen feel like he was throwing oil into a pot of water. The power of the Xuan Yellow Sutra could not blend into the blood of Zhao Ning’er.

Han Sen thought, “It looks like after Zhao Ning’er became a Break World beast, her body reached a whole other level. It is not only her power that has changed. The Xuan Yellow Sutra power cannot shift her Blood-Pulse.” He used the Xuan Yellow Sutra to break the world.

A red power slowly became visible. It was like a bloody flame that sought to envelop Zhao Ning’er’s entire body.

Han Sen sensed that after breaking the world, the Xuan Yellow Sutra could penetrate Zhao Ning’er’s body. Even if it was successful, it blended in slowly. It had the pace of a snail.

Han Sen was shocked. “The Break World beasts Qin Xiu created are scary. Zhao Ning’er has only just become a Break World beast, yet she already has this scary body. She is no weaker than a Break World power that is a solid elite or even stronger. How did Qin Xiu even manage to accomplish this? What is a life soul?”

When the Xuan Yellow Sutra’s power went into Zhao Ning’er’s body, Han Sen felt it combine extremely slowly. Because of its speed, Han Sen estimated his power would be emptied by the time he could get Zhao Ning’er back to the way she was.

Now, Zhao Ning’er’s Blood-Pulse had devolved. The feathers on her body grew smaller. Some of her skin appeared human-like. If Han Sen stopped now, Zhao Ning’er’s Blood-Pulse would be left in an impure state. The consequences of that would be bad. There was even a chance of her Blood-Pulse blowing up. If that happened, she would die.

Han Sen gnashed his teeth. He cast the Dongxuan Sutra. He went into Break World mode and put the Dongxuan Sutra’s power into Zhao Ning’er’s body. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The Break World Dongxuan Sutra could keep things at the most primitive substances. The Dongxuan Sutra could Return to Origin. The last time he combined the two of them, the Flying Yan Spear was turned into a bow. It was a very successful instance of the trick.

The Flying Yan Spear was a sacrificial weapon. It was for creating things while Zhao Ning’er was a living being. Han Sen did not know what would happen if he tried doing that for her, but he could not stop now. He had to keep going no matter what.

The grey Dongxuan Sutra’s Break World power and dark red Xuan Yellow Sutra’s Break World power combined with Zhao Ning’er’s body. In Han Sen’s eyes, Zhao Ning’er was no longer a living human. She was just a substance chain that was made from countless, small, little dots. The substance chains weaved together to create a complex machine.

Different colored dots queued up differently. They created different types of substance chains. Different substance chains lined up differently. They formed the shape of organs, like a machine with all sorts of different parts.

Han Sen shockingly realized life was just a machine. It was merely more complicated than ordinary machines.

The Dongxuan Sutra’s power let Han Sen understand Life Machine Origin. It gave him the power to take it all apart and rebuild things. The Xuan Yellow Sutra power enabled Han Sen to know what the most basic use of each machine was, and it allowed him to modify the parts into the best they could be.

Under the co-operation of these two powers, the origin of Zhao Ning’er’s body was torn apart and rebuilt. Some unneeded life substances were cut out.

More life substances were rebuilt. It made new substance chain structures.

The life soul combined with Zhao Ning’er’s body, which meant her body had major changes to it. Her life soul skills had yet to mature. After all, they were two lives combined. The difficulties and errors faced when doing something like this were too much.

Although Zhao Ning’er combined with it successfully, her body still had lots of problems to endure.

Han Sen’s Dongxuan Sutra power and Xuan Yellow Sutra power were able to sort all of this out. He combined the two in the best way possible. It made Zhao Ning’er’s body exhibit even more changes. Zhao Ning’er’s body was wrapped up by black and red power. It was like she was trapped in a cocoon of light. She was like a butterfly in a cocoon, getting changes that flipped the sky and the ground.

Zhao Qiu Yi was unable to see what was happening to Zhao Ning’er because she was trapped inside the cocoon of light. Her heart jumped. It felt as if it was going to jump out of her chest. She stared at the cocoon of light without reprieve.

“Sis, you are going to be OK?” Zhao Qiu Yi put her hand atop her chest. It looked as if she was praying

Han Sen coughed up some blood. After Zhao Ning’er broke the world, her body proved to be too strong. Han Sen had to combine two Break World powers to morph her body. Even so, it still felt extraordinarily difficult. The power in his body was almost depleted. He was going to collapse any second.

“Fortunately, Zhao Ning’er’s will is not all gone yet. If she co-operated with Bury Path God, the guy who would run away would be me. Break World beasts really are scary. I do not know how many Qin Xiu has.” Han Sen gnashed his teeth and held on. His body shook as sweat drenched his body. It was like he had just been for a dunk in water. It was a clear sign of exhaustion.

At this stage, he knew he could not give up. Even if it was just by the skin of his teeth, he had to hold on.

Han Sen’s Break World powers were not solid. They were at a lower level than Zhao Ning’er, and Zhao Ning’er’s was not solid despite being scarier than a normal solid Break World elite.

If Han Sen could break a solid Break World power, it would not be too hard to change Zhao Ning’er. Now, it was proving too hard. If Zhao Ning’er co-operated with the power, Han Sen could not change her body.

Han Sen’s skin was becoming grey. The glow in his eyes looked dim. His body was shaking and starting to look skinnier.

“I can’t hold on anymore. How much longer until she has finished modifying?” Han Sen felt like he was a lamp running out of oil. He could not continue.

This was not something he could just endure and then go past. When the power was gone, it was gone. It was like money. If it all got spent, it was all spent. He was not able to just squeeze out some more. He needed time to recover.

At this point, Han Sen did not have the time to recover. The Break World powers were not like other powers. One could not recover with the powers of the universe.

Break World powers were powers that challenged the sky. The powers of the universe could not aid them.

Many veins inside Han Sen’s body broke. They made his skin look red. Han Sen knew that if this continued, his body would collapse.

Han Sen gnashed his teeth. He looked mean. “I have to risk this for Zhao Qiu Yi’s sake. I have tried my best to help you, but to live or not live will ultimately depend on yourself.”

Han Sen suddenly used power. He instantly cast four geno arts. He entered his xenogeneic mode. He used all of his power and gunned it all into Zhao Ning’er’s body.

When his power was cast out, Han Sen’s body was completely exhausted. He did not even have the strength left to drink milk. He fell to the floor like a sack of mud and was paralyzed.
