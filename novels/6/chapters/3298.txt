While The Story of Genes was running, Han Sen’s spirit body started to change. He went from having a spirit body back to having a real body.

Han Sen was very happy. He used the black crystal power, which kept pushing for his The Story of Genes to run. His spirit body became solid. It went higher and higher.

Ancient Devil stared at the black flame and watched how the black fire exploded. The black crystal inside it broke the world. A naked body emerged from it.

Ancient Devil and Han Sen looked at each other. When Ancient Devil saw Han Sen floating in the air with his private parts wobbling like mad, his face changed. “It is you!”

Han Sen felt as if this situation was a bit awkward Fortunately, he was used to such situations. He was not panicking. He defused the situation by summoning the Dongxuan Armor to wrap up his naked body. He appeared very proud as he looked at Ancient Devil. He smiled and said, “Ancient Devil, I cannot believe we have met each other again.”

“If I had a choice in the matter, I would elect never to meet you again.” Ancient Devil deeply sighed.

He had encountered Han Sen two times. Each time, bad things had happened to him. The last time he encountered him, Han Sen had him incarcerated for many years. This time, Han Sen had just broken the gene prototype replica.

The breaking of the gene prototype replica was the worst of all. It might have been just a replica, but it was something created by the leader. There weren’t many things like that left in the universe. Ancient Devil had long cherished it. Even in all his life and death moments, he never thought about bringing it out.

He had been hoping to use the black crystal to break through the last step. Now, there was nothing left for him.

Ancient Devil wondered if he had murdered Han Sen’s family in his past life, so Han Sen was some karmic repo man out to exact vengeance in this life.

If Ancient Devil was still the vice president of the God Chaos Party, he would have turned Han Sen into dust with a single strike of the hand. That way, Han Sen would have had no chance of reappearing in front of him again. After his reincarnation, Ancient Devil had only now just broken the world. He did not need to try. He knew he could not beat Han Sen.

Ancient Devil was still curious about how Han Sen might have gained access to the 33rd sky and entered his black crystal.

“I did not mean to find you on purpose. This was a fateful encounter. It looks like our fates are deeply intertwined. Shouldn’t you, the vice president, cherish such a fateful encounter?” Han Sen did not plan on beating down Ancient Devil again.

He had tried to do that before. He suppressed Ancient Devil for a long time, but he never did extract any secrets out of him.

His identity in his past life was already a cat let loose from the bag. Ancient Devil’s face did not change. He calmly said, “In this life, I am not like how I used to be. The vice presidency of the God Chaos Party is none of my business. I am now just a small person who has just about managed to break the world in the geno universe.”

“I would believe that if it came out the mouths of others, but you are different,” Han Sen said while squinting his eyes. “You have the memories of your past life. How can you say you have no connection to your past life anymore? Ancient Devil is an ancient devil. It does not matter if it is your current life or your past life, you are Ancient Devil.”

“Why do you have to keep going against me? You locked me up for so many years, but I never looked to exact revenge, did I? Why do you have to keep bringing me harm?” Ancient Devil sighed.

Han Sen shook his head. “I did not mean to trouble you too much. This really was just an accident. Speaking of that, I actually want to thank you. Without your black crystal, I am afraid I was going to die. You just did something very good for me. Why would I think about doing anything bad to you afterward? All I have with me is a few questions I would like to ask, Mister Vice President.”

“If you ask me something I know, I will answer you.” Ancient Devil looked at Han Sen. He wasn’t really sure what he meant.

“What is the black crystal?” Han Sen already knew the black crystal was Ancient Devil’s tool to gain access to the 33rd sky.

Yet, that black crystal looked like the one Horizontal Evil had given him. It was similar to the black crystal armor in terms of presence, so Han Sen wanted to know what the connection between the two was.

“This is a geno prototype replica,” Ancient Devil said.

“A replica?” Han Sen looked conflicted.

That black crystal was almost the same as the one Horizontal Evil gave him. If that was a replica, the one Horizontal Evil had given him might have been a replica too.

Han Sen thought, “If Horizontal Evil really gave me a replica, that means Horizontal Evil gave up his life for a replica. He connected with the Break Skies and allowed himself to be tortured for countless years. It doesn’t sound like a fair trade to me.”

Han Sen thought it was very possible, but Qin Xiu’s personality wasn’t one in which he would give important items to others. There was an 80% to 90% chance that the one Horizontal Evil cherished the most was just a replica.

Thinking about that, Han Sen felt glum. A strong man like Horizontal Evil had met such a terrible end.

“Yes, it is a replica, but it comes from the God Chaos Party leader. Therefore, it is still rather amazing. It is a rare treasure in this world. I only had this one, and you came in here and destroyed it. I do not even know if there is another one out there.” Ancient Devil looked sad as he spoke.

“How many replicas were there?” Han Sen asked.

“The old leader only gave me one,” Ancient Devil replied. “As to how many replicas exist, I am afraid that is a question only the old leader can answer.”

“I have one last question for you.” Han Sen looked at Ancient Devil and asked, “What is the geno prototype?”

From what Han Sen could tell, the black crystal armor Qin Xiu controlled was a geno prototype. If Bai Mo’s last words were not a lie, this item came from the birthplace of humans. How could that connect to the God Chaos Party and its leader?

“This is the beginning of all genes. The old leader always had it. When the universe was rebooted, I do not know where the geno prototype went. I have no idea.” Ancient Devil was being very co-operative.

That being said, the answers he was giving were rather useless. Han Sen was silent a moment before saying, “If you want to leave, I will not stop you. I am afraid there is something you do not know. Qin Xiu is the leader of the God Chaos Party now. He is opening the 33 skies. If I have guessed things correctly, his purpose is the same as yours. He is here for the geno tablet.”

Ancient Devil’s face changed, but it quickly returned to normal. He coldly asked, “Did I not say my past life has nothing to do with this life? I do not care who the leader of the God Chaos Party is now. If you are not going to kill me, then I will take my leave.”

Han Sen watched Ancient Devil walk away. He did not stop him. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

After Ancient Devil disappeared from his sight, Han Sen moved his body. He looked happy as he said, “Having a body is so much better. The spirit body had no pain or tiredness, but it did not feel as if I was alive.”

After exercising, Han Sen looked around. He quickly realized he was in Outer Sky.

“It looks like Bury Path God was right. The Outer Sky is above the 33rd sky. Outer Sky resides in the geno universe.” Han Sen was delighted. This time, he did not just get his body back. He was back in the geno universe.
