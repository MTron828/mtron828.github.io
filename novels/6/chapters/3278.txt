Chapter 3279 Ancient Devil’s Identity

Zhao Ning’er had become a Break World beast. Her power had become very strong because of that. Her sonic power was scary. Even if she did not deliberately use power and just casually sang, she sounded very magical. Her performances easily affected the hearts of people.

She had a concert in a venue that had the capacity to fit 1 million people. The entire place was full. Many people wanted to buy tickets, but they were unable to. That alone signaled how attractive Zhao Ning’er was.

Han Sen sat in a VIP seat Zhao Ning’er reserved for privileged guests. He listened to Zhao Ning’er sing. He had to confess that listening to Zhao Ning’er was indeed an enjoyable experience. Dong! Dong! Dong!

The concert had only just started when someone knocked on the door.

“Why would someone be here at this time?” Han Sen frowned. The only people he knew there were Zhao Ning’er and Zhao Qiu Yi.

Zhao Ning’er was on stage, and Zhao Qiu Yi was in the same room as him. Therefore, who could have knocked on the door?

Zhao Qiu Yi got up off the couch and opened the door. She looked surprised when she saw the person outside who had come to visit. Even Han Sen was surprised by the visitor. The person was Lin Jin.

Zhao Qiu Yi lowered her head and asked, “Is there something you need?” “I would like to talk with Han Sen in private for a bit.” Lin Jin looked past Zhao Qiu Yi as he addressed her. He looked straight at Han Sen. “Let him in,” Han Sen said to Zhao Qiu Yi, who was looking a little bit scared.

Zhao Qiu Yi stepped aside. She allowed Lin Jin to enter the room and closed the door behind him.

“Do you know who I am?” Han Sen looked at Lin Jin with interest.

“You are the Qin Kingdom’s No. 1 swordsman,” Lin Jin coldly said. “You are a scary man that broke Jade Wall City. I do not think many people would not know you, but I know Han Sen is not from the Qin Kingdom. He is a man from the sanctuaries.”

Han Sen looked surprised. Lin Jin smiled and said, “Han Sen, can we talk in private now?”

“Qiu Yi, why don’t you go outside for a bit?” Han Sen suggested to Zhao Qiu Yi.

Zhao Qiu Yi left. Han Sen looked at Lin Jin and asked, “Who are you?”

Lin Jin walked next to Han Sen and sat down. “Even if you have forgotten who I, Sky King, am, you will not have forgotten who my daughter, Qin Jun, was.”

“Sky King, when did you escape the Cruel Bottle?” When Han Sen heard that, he knew for sure that there was an 80% to 90% chance that this young man was the reincarnation of Sky King Not many people knew Sky King’s daughter was Qin Jun. No one in the universe of kingdoms would have known that. Aside from him being a true reincarnation, there was no other explanation for it.

“I did not escape,” Lin Jin said. “In fact, I chose death. I died in a special way. After being reincarnated, I held onto the memories of my past life.”

“That is not easy to do. How did you manage that?” Han Sen knew reincarnation required the geno hall. It should have been impossible for a soul to maintain its memories.

“I am special,” Lin Jin said. “We can at least say the souls of the eight generals are special. There is, however, something I do not understand. After I reincarnated, I understood the switches between the two worlds. After I received a life soul, I was able to understand something further.”

Han Sen looked at Lin Jin and asked, “What is it?”

“Ancient Devil might be like me and was able to retain his past memories. Finding the eight of us from the sanctuary cannot be a coincidence. He had it all planned. It is more likely that he brought us here to kill a god. He had it planned all along. In the end, Azura betrayed him, so the plan failed.”

Han Sen always wondered where Ancient Devil was born. Sky King’s thought process made sense to him.

“What did the god you guys killed back then look like?” Han Sen had been very curious about this for a long time. Even now, he did not know which God was the one Azura consumed.

“I do not know. I only know Ancient Devil found the eight of us and used our powers to summon a living creature. When that creature appeared before us, it was dying. Even Ancient Devil was surprised by that. He did not expect the god he summoned would look the way it did. Now that I think about it, even though it was a dying god, it still took us a while to kill it. If it was an ordinary god or one that was injured instead of dying, we might have been unable to kill the god.”

Sky King did not continue talking, but Han Sen knew what he meant. If Ancient Devil knew the god he had summoned was powerful, then his purpose to summon that god was not for killing him.

Han Sen looked at Sky King and said, “You didn’t come looking for me just to tell me this.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Sky King sighed. “If I did not have to, I would not come looking for you. The memories of my past life were sealed during my reincarnation. Without the accident, even if I reincarnated again, those memories will be hard to claim. The life soul the God Chaos Party gave me opened me up to the memories of my past life. That way, I was able to learn about it.”

After pausing, Sky King went on to say, “Things like life souls are things the God Chaos Party has under control. Even if I finished combining things now, I would still be controlled by the God Chaos Party. Perhaps you can help me.”

“Why would I want to help you?” Han Sen asked with a lift of his lips.

He and Sky King were never friends. In the past life, they were enemies. Even without those circumstances, there was no reason for him to help Sky King.

“I do not know what kind of creature Ancient Devil summoned, but I do know a secret about Ancient Devil,” Sky King said with a smile. “If you can free me from the God Chaos Party, I can tell you a secret you will be interested in learning more about.”

“What secret? Let me hear it.” Han Sen did not believe Sky King

Sky King did not deny his request. He smiled and said, “I discovered this secret shortly after I got my memories back. It has something to do with the God Chaos Party. You are going to love it.”

Han Sen did not think it would surprise him, but he paused for a long time before saying, “I can help you to the best of my abilities, but I must know the secret first.”

Sky King quickly answered, “I went to the God Chaos Party and saw something interesting there. There was an old painting. That painting displayed the God Chaos Party’s old leader, his three vice presidents, and other primary members. There were four core members of the God Chaos Party. I recognized two of them. One of them was Bury Path God. The other one was...”

Sky King paused on purpose. Han Sen asked, “Was it Ancient Devil?”

Sky King nodded. “Yes. The vice president in the painting was Ancient Devil. It had to be him.”

“Ancient Devil was a vice president of the God Chaos Party.” Han Sen frowned.
