Chapter 3374&nbsp; Almost Died

Pang!

Following the strong will, Han Sen’s body started to dissolve.

Han Sen, Wan’er, and Chaos split into three separate entities. They all flew in different directions.

The scary power suddenly vanished. Qin Xiu looked cold. The black crystal armor started again. It was like a devil in front of Han Sen aiming at his forehead.

Han Sen still kept his pure spirit body mode engaged. His heart jumped. He wanted to break the rules of the universe and reduce the restrictions.

Unfortunately, the black crystal armor’s power could control a pure spirit body. The whole of space was not trapped. Han Sen’s spirit body was unable to leave.

He knew this was a life-or-death moment. Without hesitation, Han Sen gnashed his teeth and exited his pure spirit mode. His xenogeneic battle body madly exploded with power. The Dongxuan Armor wrapped up his body. The Story of Genes broke the world and created a white flame that hastily wreathed his body.

The Blood-Pulse Sutra boiled in his blood. Jadeskin unleashed its frosting chill. Han Sen gunned his power to the max and threw a punch at Qin Xiu’s finger.

The finger touched down on the tip of his finger. It led to Han Sen being petrified. His power was uncontrollably going forth to strike Qin Xiu.

Qin Xiu looked at Han Sen coldly, “I already told you that the geno prototype armor is an origin point of the whole universe. No matter how much you change it, for as long as it is in the rules of the universe, you will be restricted by the geno prototype armor. If I want you to live, you will live. If I want to see you die, you will die.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Even though Qin Xiu said that, he didn’t have to. Han Sen knew it all too well. He used to have a geno prototype armor. He used the geno prototype armor to evolve creatures and beast souls. It did not cost him any energy to do that either.

Now that he thought about it some more, if it was not the universe’s origin that could wrap up every gene message in the universe. He could not have done that.

While Han Sen was staring down this immense power, it was very hard for him to deal with it.

“If you want to suck it, I will let you suck it.” Han Sen did not fall back. Instead, he moved forward. His long hair was flying. His entire battle body went mad. He absorbed his power, trying to shake Qin Xiu away.

The black crystal armor’s spells were floating. No matter how powerful Han Sen’s strength was, it was going to be absorbed by the black crystal armor. The stronger Han Sen became, the stronger the black crystal armor would become.

The black crystal armor was like a monster that could keep on evolving. Any power that landed on it would be nutritious, and it would work to make it bigger.

Han Sen’s power did not harm him. All he could achieve was making the black crystal armor stronger, lending aid to Qin Xiu.

Even though this occurred in a single, small moment in time, Han Sen felt his body become empty. It was like he was going to be sucked dry.

Qin Xiu said, “For you to be able to evolve to this level, I have to confess that you aren’t all that bad. Considering the fact that you looked after Wan’er for me in the past, I will give you the ability to reincarnate. Next time, don’t make yourself my enemy. He then raised his other hand. It turned into a fist. He aimed at Han Sen’s head as he launched it.

“No!” Suddenly, there was a scream. A person had managed to rush there and shield Han Sen. It was Wan’er, who had been separated from Han Sen.

Wan’er’s body was looking very clear. It was starting to go back to black. It was clearly the Witch Wan’er’s will that was suppressing Qin Wan’er’s will. It was taking over and becoming the primary.

“Brother Qin Xiu, I beg you. Please, do not hurt Big Brother. Let him go. If you do not like it so much, I will make sure I never see him again.” Wan’er was in front of Han Sen. She kept begging.

Upon seeing all the tears roll down Wan’er’s cheeks, Qin Xiu lowered his fist. He suddenly looked rather soft. He stroked Wan’er’s hair and said, “Wan’er, if you like him so much, I would do anything for you.”

After that, Qin Xiu put back the finger that was against Han Sen’s fist. He held Wan’er’s waist. He took her with him and fled.

“Brother Qin Xiu, I thank you. I will listen to you from now on,” Wan’er said. She went back to Han Sen and shouted, “Quick! Leave! Leave and never come back!”

Qin Xiu softly pulled Wan’er away with him as he said, “Let’s go, Wan’er.”

When Wan’er turned back, Qin Xiu’s other hand cast a silent power. He had collected it for so long, but he suddenly launched a fist toward Han Sen, who was now in the air.

Han Sen was not as naive as Wan’er. He knew Qin Xiu was not going to just let him go. He saw that beam of light, which was made of countless black spells, come silently for him. He had to gnash his teeth and explode the leftover power he had in the welcome of the nasty light.

The silent power exploded in the air. The whole world looked as if it had been disturbed by that mysterious power.

Wan’er was being held by Qin Xiu, but she moved. She was not able to feel the power floating. She did not realize the disaster that was happening behind her. Qin Xiu quickly took her out of the 33rd sky.

Katcha! Katcha!

Han Sen’s Dongxuan Armor was starting to crack under the duress of that scary power. His muscles and bones were being torn apart. His powerful xenogeneic battle body could not withstand the scary attack.

A black light came from space. It was the black crystal armor Chaos had. It suddenly clad Han Sen’s body with a strange type of power that fought back the scary power alongside Han Sen.

Chaos herself was just a spirit, and she had given up the geno prototype armor. She did not have much power, and Han Sen was weak. With the two of their powers, they could not block the scary attacks.

All the bones in Han Sen’s body were moaning and crying. The black crystal armor started to crack more and more. It seemed as if it was going to break.

“I am going to die.” Han Sen felt his body break. He roared and adopted his Super God Spirit body’s Break World shape to try and survive the onslaught.

He suddenly felt a power inside his body. That power was very weird. He suddenly reversed everything. Qin Xiu’s scary attack suddenly became a nice beam of light.

“Ultimate Egg!” Han Sen felt some sort of power inside him.

The Ultimate Egg had not moved for a long time. Han Sen thought he had refined it already. Now, he was able to notice the Ultimate Egg was still in his body. It was spinning fast, unleashing a weird sort of power.

“Is that thing inside you? You are lucky. Let us escape now!” Chaos was surprised by this too, but she still hurried Han Sen to leave.

Han Sen did not dare hesitate. He dragged his weakened body to employ the Super God Spirit mode, break the world, and leave the 33 skies.

“He had the Ultimate Egg.” Qin Xiu frowned. Looking back in the 33rd sky’s direction, Qin Xiu was not looking too well. Seeing Wan’er hold his arm, the corners of his eyes trembled. He gave up on going back to the 33rd sky.

“The geno prototype armor is mine now. I will be able to kill them whenever. They can live for a few more days.” Qin Xiu looked calm, but he still sent a message.

The scary creatures that obeyed Qin Xiu received Qin Xiu’s messages. They went on the move.
