Chapter 1589: Second Uncle

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When Zuo Lan heard what Han Sen said, she wasn’t sure if what he was telling the truth, but she understood.

The secretary could only roll her eyes and say, “This is a big business matter, and he goes to the sanctuary? And what is this attitude of yours? And what is with these children? Are you a manager or a babysitter?”

Yu Hetian looked displeased. He didn’t like Han Sen at all.

Han Sen, seeing them, had to resist the urge to laugh. He wouldn’t let Xie Qing King’s work end up in the hands of such people, and he thought it’d be wasted on them.

Even though Han Sen did not know much about art, he knew Yu Hetian did not know much about art, either. Han Sen wanted to do something good for Xie Qing King, but he wasn’t willing to give the rights of the book to such people.

“What are you smiling for?” Yu Hetian asked, sensing Han Sen’s desire to laugh.

Han Sen laughed. “You might think this is a big business matter, but I’m telling you now that it is small. I decided that I could spare the time to come to this meeting, but if you don’t like the way I have presented myself, then let’s just shelve the discussion.”

After that, Han Sen turned around and headed toward the door. Overbearing President Love Luv Looove! needed to be published, but he had to ensure those handling it were excellent. Even if Han Sen did not earn much money, that did not matter very much as long as the adaptation was done exceptionally.

Zuo Lan and Yu Hetian were in shock. They hadn’t expected Han Sen to say what he did. Normal managers wanted to earn money, but he was leaving as if he didn’t care at all.

“Small business? Do you have any idea how much we are willing to invest? Do you know how much you will earn once the deal is done? You’ll never earn this much money any other way.” The secretary looked annoyed.

Zuo Lan stepped forward and said, “We are here for business. We can all sit down and talk.”

Han Sen looked at Zuo Lan and said, “There is no need for talk. Chief Editor Zuo, please find some decent people next time. I will only sell the copyright to people who can really make good films. If you only have people like this lined up, don’t bother contacting me.”

Zuo Lan knew things were about to get much worse. Yu Hetian really hated it when people talked as if he didn’t know anything. The truth was, though, he didn’t.

Dong Te Film was rich, but that did not mean they could craft exceptional films. They weren’t even all that popular in the Alliance. Yu Hetian was one of the shareholders of Starry Group, too. Dong Te Film was initially constructed for fun, as something to support actresses.

Wei Minzhen, the secretary, was one of Yu Hetian’s mistresses. She was his favorite. The reason he wanted to film this movie was because of her. She wanted to be the main character and earn fame.

Although Yu Hetian was just playing, he hated it when people suggested he didn’t know anything.

“Young man, don’t be so reckless. If you continue like this, you’ll cluelessly walk by opportunities that are right in front of you.” Yu Hetian stumped out his cigarette in the ashtray. He spoke to Han Sen coldly.

“Chief Editor, if there is nothing else to discuss, I’m leaving.” Han Sen attended the meeting to talk about copyright, yes, but it was also just a way for him to take Littleflower for a walk.

Han Sen’s mood was ruined by the way things had turned out, and he had no intention of talking with them.

Zuo Lan wished to say something, but before she could, Yu Hetian said coldly, “Young man, do you think that if you leave now, Overbearing President Love Luv Looove! will never be sold?”

When Han Sen heard the man say that, he turned around. He looked at him and said, “Yu Hetian, right? You talk big, but I’ve never even heard your name before.”

“You’ve never heard the names of the shareholders of Starry Group? How can you consider yourself a manager?” Wei Minzhen coldly laughed.

“I know a few people from Starry Group, but not Yu Hetian,” Han Sen said and turned to leave.

Not even the other shareholders of Starry Group or the controllers of Starry Group, the Ning family, would treat him this way.

Hearing Han Sen say this, Zuo Lan felt dizzy. Things were turning sour real quick.

Yu Hetian was enraged. He slammed the table, wanting to say something, but just as he was about to, his phone rang.

Yu Hetian was so angry that he almost destroyed it. He looked at the screen and picked it up.

“Mister Yue, why are you contacting me? I can do anything. I won’t disappoint you.” Yu Hetian forced a smile to the video stream of the on-screen call.

The image showed Ning Yue, dressed in white clothing. Ning Yue was still as elegant as ever, even after all the time that had passed.

Yu Hetian immediately became nervous, seeing Ning Yue. Even though it was just a video call, the respect he showed was nothing that could be faked.

Ning Yue ignored him, though. Ning Yue saw Han Sen leaving, through the video, and said, “Han Sen, why are you here?”

Ning Yue remembered Han Sen. He recognized him, even though he could just see his back and he was wearing a disguise.

“Ning Yue, long time no see.” Han Sen, hearing Ning Yue, turned around to say hello.

There was still tension between the two, so it was difficult to discern if they were friends or foes.

“I was going to drop by your house, but since you’re here, there is no need for me to go. My Second Uncle wishes to buy you dinner. Do you have the time?” Ning Yue said.

After Ning Yue said this, Yu Hetian’s legs felt soft. Rivers of cold sweat began to cascade down his back. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

When Ning Yue spoke to Han Sen, Yu Hetian couldn’t muster a reaction. But when Ning Yue mentioned his Second Uncle, Yu Hetian’s heart almost exploded.

People knew the Ning family had an old man. He was a demi-god, but few people knew that bit. They also had a Second Uncle. He was the genuinely cruel one. He dictated the lives of those in Starry Group.

Ning family had become this famous, not because of the old man, but because of the Second Uncle.

The Second Uncle in the Ning family would only eat dinner with the president if he felt like it. He had never bought food for anyone else, either. This was a request no other demi-god had received before.

Now that Second Uncle wished to buy the young man dinner, Yu Hetian’s body began to shake. He felt as if he was going to pee himself, as a cold chill struck him.
