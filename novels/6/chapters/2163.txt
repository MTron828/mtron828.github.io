Chapter 2164 Knife Spikes the Ocean

“He isn’t going to copy Knife Queen and remove a part of the peak for himself, is he?” asked the black-masked woman. She stood next to the Sky Palace leader, her head tilted slightly to the side.

“Hm. I bet both of them will do the same thing,” the Sky Palace leader grumbled, thinking that was exactly what Han Sen was going to do.

The masked woman laughed and said, “Han Sen is strong, but he has only just become a Marquise. Knife Queen was a Duke when she left, so his attempt will be considerably weaker. And even Knife Queen was only able to cut off a small part of the peak. Now that the peak is seven or eight meters thick, even if Han Sen strikes with all of his strength, he will only be able to knock off a small chunk of the stone. Don’t worry so much.”

“Sky Palace has much of this resource. Even if I gave him as much as he could take, how much would that really be? This is like an ant taking a swing at a tree. Let him,” the Sky Palace leader asserted confidently.

The Sky Palace leader couldn’t do anything to stop Han Sen from taking whatever he wished to, because it was a tradition for departing students to leave their name on the ocean mountain or take a chunk of the ocean stone as a souvenir. Han Sen wasn’t the only student who sought to do such a thing.

And Sky Palace had no shortage of ocean stones, anyway. If they did not have so much of the resource, they wouldn’t have used one as their ocean monument.

And most students, even the best of elites, could only take the tiny bits of stone that crumbled from their carvings on the wall. Yisha was the only one who had ever managed to slice off the entire peak. No one else had ever been able to do as she had.

Everyone was now looking at Han Sen, as Han Sen remained standing on his red cloud before the peak. He looked down on the mountaintop, but he didn’t step down onto it.

Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura, and the ocean stone became a sequence structure in the eye of his mind. He found that small hole.

“It’s here.” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He landed atop the peak and brought out his Ghost Teeth Knife.

Han Sen smiled. “Since taking a small piece of the ocean stone would be pointless, let’s see if the bug within is still alive.”

Han Sen was interested in learning more about the creature that had made the ocean stone, so he had given up on the idea of cutting the ocean stone itself. He drew his Ghost Teeth Knife and channeled power into its tip.

Bao’er was still sitting atop Han Sen’s shoulder, and she observed his knife curiously. Then, she looked at the ocean stone. She seemed to understand something.

But no one else understood what Han Sen intended to do when he drew his knife like that.

“Is Teacher Han going to carve some words into the mountain’s peak? The peak is good, yes, but no one will be able to see it up there.”

“It cannot simply be writing, surely. People leave words on the wall, but they never do it on the flat surface up top. If he writes his name up there, anyone ventures up top will end up stepping on his name. Han Sen is so smart, so I’m sure he wouldn’t be that stupid.”

“If he isn’t going to write something, then what is the point going up there?”

Everyone was confused, unable to guess what Han Sen was planning. Even the masked woman next to the Sky Palace leader frowned. “What is he doing? If he wants to cut the ocean stone, that isn’t good a position to do it from. The angle is all wrong for cutting.”

The Sky Palace leader frowned as he looked at Han Sen. Something seemed amiss. Han Sen was just a Marquise, so there was no way he could make a cut all the way down into the stone from that angle.

Yun Suyi and the others looked at Han Sen with curiosity. They didn’t know what he was going to do, either.

Han Sen gripped his Ghost Teeth Knife tighter and tighter.

Han Sen had learned to gather up power from the Dragon, and he had honed his ability to make very small knife silks. So, he prepared to fire them. He directed the knife silks to shoot down into that incredibly small hole. If that stone bug was still alive, it’d react if the knife silks came into contact with it.

Of course, Han Sen did not plan on killing it. He was just trying to get a sense of where the stone bug was. If the silks touched the bug, it was sure to move. It wouldn’t be killed. Han Sen was confident in his control of the knife silks.

But the ocean mountain was ten thousand meters tall. Even if the stone bug was dead in the center, it would be thousands of meters away. Not just any Marquise could send a knife silk that far.

Han Sen was skilled with both Moon and Yin Yang Blast. If he hadn’t been, sending it that far would have been impossible.

But Han Sen wasn’t extremely confident, so he sent all his focus into his work. He threw Ghost Teeth Knife into the ocean stone to leave his mark. That was to be his memory.

Everyone watched as Han Sen stood atop the peak, both of his hands gripping Ghost Teeth Knife tightly. The knife was pointed down, and a strange black and purple knifelight was glowing across its blade. It was like there was a demon roaring from the knife.

Han Sen’s power was raging through him. He used all his strength, channeling everything he had into his hands as the tip of the knife rammed down into the small hole.

Katcha!

Power surged down, and Ghost Teeth Knife slid into the stone, sinking up to the hilt.

Han Sen kneeled there, with his hands still gripping the handle. He maintained his position and did not pull out. He was still.

Everyone was shocked. The knife remained handle deep in the stone. A normal Marquise would have no chance of stabbing a knife into that stone. Even getting the knife a few inches deep would have been impossible.

That knife was fiercely strong, but given Han Sen’s reputation, it was still less than what the observers had expected of him. The Sky Palace students thought Han Sen would do something impressive with the knife in his hand. They thought he would draw or write something, but Han Sen did not move.

Normal people couldn’t see what was actually happening, though. Han Sen’s strike sent the knife silks down into the hole, and they were traveling deep into the mountain now.

This was a unique technique, and making the silks smaller than that hole was a very demanding task. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As the knife silks continued down into the hole, he knew he couldn’t risk allowing them to touch the stone. If that happened, the power would come to an immediate standstill.

Directing the silks flawlessly down thousands of meters of narrow tube was something very few in the entire universe could do.

Plus, the hole had formed naturally, not cut with a laser. It wasn’t perfectly straight. If the knife silks touched the crooks in the hole, it’d be game over. Without Han Sen’s ability to sense things and his amazing control on the silks, he’d never have been able to send them where he wanted to.
