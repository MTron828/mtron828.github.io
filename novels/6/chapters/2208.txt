Chapter 2209 Bring it if you Want to

Night River King thought Han Sen wouldn’t be allowed to go with the Extreme King, but when he saw the recruitment roster the next day, Han Sen’s name was on it. This made him exuberantly happy.

Han Sen had just been added that day. Seeing his name there made Night River King want to scream in joy.

“Good! This is exactly as I’d hoped.” Night River King had to do his best to contain his mirth.

If Han Sen was gone, then it wouldn’t just be Cold Palace that Night River King could keep for himself. He could likely take over Planet Eclipse unhindered. He could erase all trace of Han Sen having ever existed in Narrow Moon.

Over the next few days, Night River King was on cloud nine as he waited for Han Sen to be taken away by the Ice Blue Knights.

The recruitment process was still ongoing, and the elites on Planet Eclipse soon started packing their things. It seemed as if Han Sen really was on his way out. Night River King couldn’t wait for the fifteenth of the month to come, so he could bask in and absorb all the moonlight he wanted.

The Ice Blue Knights would leave on the fourteenth. He could go and absorb moonlight the day after that. He was so happy.

As Han Sen packed his things, he began making plans.

Bao’er, Little Angel, Zero, Han Meng’er, Huangfu Jing, Han Yan, Ji Qing, Little Silver, Little Invisible, and Little Star were going with the group of knights as well. But they wouldn’t actually be Ice Blue Knights themselves. Instead, they would act as guards tasked with protecting Mister White.

Mister White was obviously important, but other than that, Han Sen didn’t know exactly what position the man held within Extreme King society. He only knew that the Ice Blue Knights referred to the man as an “advisor.” But even the half-deified Ice Blue Knight King greatly admired him.

If he hadn’t agreed to be Mister White’s guard, then Han Sen would never have been allowed to bring so many people with him.

The only people they left behind on Planet Eclipse were those that wouldn’t be able to grow in the chaos systems. Little Angel and the others had developed as far as they could on Planet Eclipse, so going to the systems of chaos would allow them to continue gaining strength.

He had wanted to tame the Shadow Queen Bee, but he had no more time. He eventually had no choice but to kill it inside its hive.

Otherwise, after he and his strongest people left, there’d be no one left to control the Queen Bee. The base would be in trouble once the Queen Bee started breeding again.

“Mutant Xenogeneic Duke Shadow Queen Bee killed. Mutant xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Shadow Queen Bee beast soul.”

Han Sen was happy. He hadn’t expected to earn the Shadow Queen Bee’s beast soul. He looked into his Sea of Soul to examine what sort of beast soul it was.

Ordinary Shadow Bees were toxic arrow beast souls, so gaining a Duke toxic arrow beast soul wouldn’t be bad.

Mutant Shadow Queen Bee: pet beast soul (evolvable)

Han Sen was shocked to see the description, but disappointed, as well. Pet beast souls needed to reach combat mode if they were ever expected to fight. He didn’t have the time to grow a pet right now. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

But after he thought about it, Han Sen’s eyes lit up. He realized that the Shadow Queen Bee pet beast soul was different.

It could reproduce endlessly. If Han Sen could keep cultivating it, the pet could spawn additional bees out of flesh on the battlefield. It could be used to spawn an infinite number of bees.

The most important thing, though, was the fact that it was evolvable. If the Shadow Queen Bee could reach King class, then it should be able to spawn King class Shadow Bees.

When Han Sen thought about King Shadow Bees flying everywhere, he felt incredibly happy.

“I have to grow this pet.” Han Sen merrily summoned the Shadow Queen Bee.

A red crystal Shadow Queen Bee began to fly all around Han Sen. It looked like a very calm being, but it was small too. It was far smaller than the original Shadow Queen Bee. It was only around the size of a man’s fist. It looked as if it needed to reach battle mode before it would become a proper queen bee.

Han Sen wasn’t a Duke yet, so he couldn’t consume the queen bee’s mutant xenogeneic gene. He would need to hold onto it for a while.

Han Sen gave Xie Qing King a ring, and he told his old friend that he was joining the Extreme King. Han Sen also told him that he shouldn’t ever go back to Planet Eclipse.

After everything was established, the recruitment drive for the Ice Blue Knights was over. Out of the whole of Narrow Moon, only a dozen elites had been selected. They were mostly Rebate Earls and Marquises, with a single Duke joining as well.

The day that the Ice Blue Knights would be leaving, Han Sen brought his companions to them to enroll.

Night River King was grinning like a lunatic, and when he saw Han Sen taking his whole family with him, he laughed and said, “Han Sen, you can leave them here! I will be delighted to look after your friends and family.”

Han Sen looked at Night River King and smiled. “Thanks, but no thanks. They are coming with me to join the Ice Blue Knights.”

Night River King looked at him with disdain. “What do you think the Ice Blue Knights are? Do you think you can take along anyone you want to?”

Black-Moon King and Moon Wheel King didn’t know what Han Sen was doing either. It was hard enough for someone to join the Ice Blue Knights, but bringing family and friends along was simply out of the question.

But Han Sen wasn’t someone who would make random, unfounded claims. He must have had a sound reason for saying what he just did.

“You are right. I can bring anyone I want, and not only them. I can take you, if you want to go.” Han Sen smiled at Night River King.

“A lame joke,” Night River King grunted, but he suddenly felt a little nervous.

Han Sen turned his back on Night River King and moved to join the Ice Blue Knights with his companions.

Moon Wheel King and Night River King watched Han Sen take his entire family into the knights’ camp. He even brought a child. And on top of that, it seemed as if Ice Blue Knight King was okay with it. The Rebate lined up, their eyes wide. They couldn’t believe that this was happening.

This was one of Extreme King’s top ten knight groups. Everyone knew how hard it was to enlist with any of them. Many of the Rebate Nobles had wished to send their kids to join them, but only the people that passed the tests were allowed in.

Han Sen’s people hadn’t even undergone the tests, and what’s more, there was a child amongst them. But they joined the Ice Blue Knights without hindrance. This greatly surprised the onlookers.

Night River King looked aghast. Han Sen had taken his whole family. He wouldn’t be able to beat Han Sen even if he claimed Planet Eclipse.

Night River King gritted his teeth. Ice Blue Knight King then suddenly said, “Night River King, I need people right now. I will have you join the Ice Blue Knights and work for Extreme King. Come now!”

Everyone in Narrow Moon was shocked. Night River King looked shell-shocked. He forced a smile. “Thank you, but...”

Before Night River King could finish his sentence, Ice Blue Knight King revealed a conscription paper. He said, “This is a recruitment order that comes straight from the Extreme King’s ruler. Are you going to go against this decree?”

“I won’t!” Night River King looked ill. He was as stunned as he was angry. He thought about what Han Sen had said, then turned to look at him. Han Sen was smiling his way.
