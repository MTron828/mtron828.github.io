2306 King Tree

The ring gleamed a beautiful silver, and there was a green jewel-like eye at its top. It looked gorgeous.

Han Sen turned the ring over and over in his hands, his face set in intense concentration.

He had chosen the ring because he was unable to identify its level. If something could block the vision of the Purple-Eye Butterfly, then it had to be good. There was every chance that it was also a deified item.

Han Sen wasn’t as concerned with consequences as Bai Wei had been, so he picked this ring immediately.

But as Han Sen played with the ring, he realized he was unable to activate whatever power it possessed. Han Sen tried to trigger it by sending his own power into the ring, but there was no response. It was like an ordinary toy.

“Why is there a ring here? What level is it?” Bai Wei, upon seeing the ring, couldn’t help but frown. There should only have been weapons in the Grave of Soldiers and Kings. She had never heard of anything else being found.

“I don’t know. Maybe I can’t activate it because the power of my element isn’t correctly aligned,” Han Sen thought. Then, he put the ring on his finger and said, “I have already chosen this, so there’s no time for regret. Come on, let’s go.”

Bai Wei looked at the ring on Han Sen’s hand, and she didn’t say anything. Together, they left The Grave of Soldiers and Kings and hurried towards the King’s Garden.

Bai Wei didn’t really care about the weapon she had chosen. She was in a rush to leave the Grave so that she could finally train in the King’s Garden.

The King’s Garden was at the center of the King’s Kingdom. Han Sen and Bai Wei journeyed into the heart of the King’s Kingdom, and suddenly, Han Sen’s eyes brightened.

A giant xenogeneic emerged from the darkness of space and flew right past them. It was as big as a planet, and it looked like a dinosaur from ancient times, but flames crackled across its body.

“That is a Flaming Demon Dragon. It is a deified xenogeneic that patrols the entirety of the King’s Kingdom,” Bai Wei said. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The King’s Kingdom was grander than Han Sen had imagined. There were many strange things there that continually snared his attention. So much so that he found it difficult to look away from the sights. Everywhere he looked, a myriad of creatures swept past them.

Suddenly, Han Sen saw something. He could not control his face at the sight, and so his jaw went slack.

“What is it?” Bai Wei asked apprehensively.

She had seen Han Sen in all sorts of dangerous situations before, but he had never made a face like that.

“What is that?” Han Sen asked, pointing out in front of them.

Han Sen pointed to an area in the system that had no day or night cycle. There was a giant building that looked like a star, but rather than residing on a planet, the entire building hung in space.

It was an ancient tower. It hung ethereally in space, like some kind of strange mirage. It was very old, mysterious, and cold. It felt like it didn’t belong to that world, as it didn’t match anything around it.

The tower was made of black stones, and it had seven floors. A black bell hung from each corner of the tower, but the bells weren’t tolling at all; it was like they were frozen. They hung completely motionless, looking rather dead.

It wasn’t the tower’s strange appearance that shocked Han Sen; he was caught off guard by the fact that the tower looked exactly like Destiny’s Tower.

But this tower had been built from black stones, while Destiny’s Tower was made entirely of metal. Everything else was the same, though. And when Han Sen saw the word “Destiny” written on the side of the tower, his stomach clenched. The word wasn’t written in the common language of the geno universe, either. It was written in one of the ancient languages of the Alliance.

Bai Wei followed Han Sen’s finger to the old tower that hung in space. After a pause, she said, “That is our holy tower. Only people who have performed amazing deeds are allowed to study in there.”

“Holy tower?” Han Sen looked at Bai Wei with some confusion, hoping she could explain.

Bai Wei shook her head. “I don’t know much about the holy tower. I only know that it is very mysterious. Anyone who enters it will become much stronger when they come back out. But only those of the Extreme King who have performed amazing feats are allowed entry, and no one who comes back out of the tower talks about what they saw inside. I don’t know what is in there.”

After pausing, Bai Wei said, “I have heard there is a mysterious geno art in there. It’s a powerful art that provides great aid to any who learn it. But the people who go in usually emerge having learned different geno arts. It’s difficult to guess what actually happens in the tower, and these are just rumors. I don’t know how true they are. Only those who enter will know what is inside.”

“Is it something that some ancestor of the Extreme King left behind?” Han Sen asked, trying to suppress his shock.

“I don’t think so. The legends say that the holy tower already existed when the King’s Kingdom xenogeneic space was discovered. It is the same with Sky Palace’s White Jade Jing. No one really knows why they exist.”

“Is this Destiny tower connected with my Destiny’s Tower? Going by what I’ve learned of history here, when the Extreme King’s holy tower appeared, there should not have been any humans yet. Why is there Alliance text on the tower, then?” Han Sen couldn’t stop thinking about this, but he could not figure it out.

Han Sen was dying to enter the tower to take a look, but he wouldn’t be allowed to even get close to the tower. It took all of his willpower to keep from staring at that ancient tower. To distract himself, he turned his attention back to the King’s Garden.

King’s Garden wasn’t a planet, but a piece of land floating in space. It looked larger and lusher than a planet, though.

A giant tree stood in the middle of the island in space, the tree’s enormous canopy shading the entire landmass. It was too big to be properly described.

The tree’s body was black, and its leaves were yellow. It looked very pretty.

After they got close to King’s Garden, Han Sen felt just how scary that King Tree was. Even a random leaf was bigger than an entire football stadium.

Weird symbols were etched all across the leaves. As Han Sen got closer, the symbols turned out to be the veins of the leaves.

But each vein was unique, and they all possessed a mysterious, shifting power.

“The King Tree is the Extreme King’s source of culture. The symbols were adopted into the language of the Extreme King. Now, the official language of the Extreme King is Kingese. We only use the universal language with outsiders,” Bai Wei explained.

Han Sen nodded, and then he entered King’s Garden with Bai Wei.

The mountains and rivers were all underneath that King Tree. It was hard to describe how glorious it all looked.

Once they landed on King’s Garden, Han Sen looked around, dumbfounded. There were real dragons living near the mountains and rivers. They all had frightening presences, like godly creatures from ancient times.

“They are not real dragons. They are the roots of the King Tree,” Bai Wei said.
