Chapter 3121 Moon God

Han Sen practiced Jadeskin. It came from Moon God’s Cold Sutra legacy. In the Alliance and the Geno Universe, it was related to the Cold Sutra.

Han Sen was never entirely sure about the true creator of the Cold Sutra. He believed it was just some character called Moon God. As to what class or race Moon God was, or perhaps even if it was a God Spirit, Han Sen simply had no idea.

In the universe of kingdoms, there was a power that was similar to Jadeskin. Aside from the Cold Sutra, Han Sen could not come up with any other idea as to where this had come from.

It was different from pure ice power. The power of the Cold Sutra was not purely based on the cold. The cold was surface-deep. The core of the Cold Sutra was a geno art that could purify one’s body to reinforce genes and perfect a body, allowing a person to reach a zenith of performance where one had no flaws.

But he was in the universe of kingdoms. To the Alliance, it was considered an anti-material world. The Cold Sutra, by all accounts, should not have been able to work there. But the coldness ahead of them was collected by the Cold Sutra, and it was not restricted by the world.

It made Han Sen quite curious. He looked at the woman, who was encased in ice. He was not able to see anything clearly because of the thick layer of ice. Guessing from her shape, Han Sen sensed that she was a beautiful woman he had never seen before.

“No... This is not the Cold Sutra.” Han Sen touched the ice. He felt the power on its surface and did not think that was right. Although it was very similar, he sensed something different when he felt it.

Bald Guy looked at the woman inside the ice and excitedly said, “I am going to be rich. What is inside cannot be a pretty, humanoid gene race. Don’t you guys dare fight for it. I want this pretty humanoid gene race. I can pay you your share.”

Li Bing Yu coldly asked, “Are you crazy? Does this ice look like a gene race?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Ice snakes and many ice gene eggs use ice for a shell. Perhaps this humanoid gene race does the same.” Bald Guy looked at the woman encased in ice with saliva drooling from his mouth.

It was not as if he had never seen a beautiful woman before. It was just that humanoid gene races were extremely rare. Li Bing Yu said, “If I were you, I would not be so optimistic.”

Bald Guy wished to say something, but he soon saw the ice start to melt due to the exposure to light. Cold air arose from the thaw, creating a white fog.

“Careful,” Li Bing Yu said as she retreated. She seemed to be afraid of the cold air.

Han Sen fell back too. He pulled Bald Guy away. He knew the Cold Sutra was powerful, and that ice would not just possess cold air.

Bald Guy fell back a little slower. The cold air touched his sleeve, which was instantly crystallized. Bald Guy ripped it off. It turned into shattered crystals scattered across the ground.

Bald Guy was in shock. He did not hesitate any longer. He hurried to retreat and escape the area.

He witnessed the tree roots develop a white, cold fog that wrapped the entire plum tree. When there was light all around, it shone like a rainbow.

When the cold air arose, the plum tree’s petals started to die. Many of the pink petals surfed the cold air. It was weirdly pretty. It was like a showering of flowers in reverse.

In between all the flower rain, the voice of a woman was very vaguely heard within the cold. “Thousands of nights filled with a feeling of emptiness and hatred. I would rather be drunk and not wake up.”

“That woman is alive...” Bald Guy’s eyes opened wide as he peered into the mist. He saw a white shadow approaching. When she heard the woman’s voice, Li Bing Yu’s face morphed. “Oh, no! She is the Qin Kingdom’s Night God No Moon. Run!”

Han Sen and Bald Guy were shocked. They had never heard of Night God No Moon before. After hearing Li Bing Yu’s shout, they knew this must have been a powerful adversary. They were going to follow Li Bing Yu and retreat, but they heard the woman quietly say, “I can’t believe someone can still recall my name.”

While she spoke, the woman emerged from the cold fog. It was the white-clothed woman who had previously been encased in ice. Her bare feet touched the ground. A scary cold light flashed with each step. It turned everything around into ice.

Li Bing Yu tore through space to escape. She was frozen in the air. Bald Guy’s mouth was wide open, as were his eyes. He turned into an ice statue. Han Sen’s body flashed with gold light, but he was restricted by the ice light. He was unable to leave. He had cold air all over him. Fortunately, his body was resistant to it. He had already practiced something similar to Jadeskin. If he had not, even with the gold wing peacock king, he would have been reduced to an ice cube.

“Have you practiced the Cold Sutra?” the white-clothed woman asked as she looked upon Han Sen with shock. She observed him closely.

Han Sen looked at the white-clothed woman and asked, “Have you practiced the Cold Sutra too? Who are you?” The white-clothed woman did not answer. Her feet were light. She was like a fairy from the outer sky as she landed in front of Han Sen. She pointed her fingers at Han Sen’s eyebrows. The way she moved was elegant, but it still made Han Sen develop goosebumps. It was like some wild flood or a crazy tiger was looking at him.

He flapped his gold god wings, generating gold light. A gold light feather formed behind Han Sen. A sky full of feathers went flying toward the white-clothed woman.

The gold peacock feathers flying through the air were frozen mid-flight. Han Sen was flying extremely fast. Since the scary, cold light froze the wings on his back, his airborne travel was slowed down a lot.

The woman’s body did not change. Her jade fingers were still pointing at Han Sen’s eyebrows the same way. She was coming closer.

Han Sen looked very glum. The woman’s Cold Sutra expertise was frighteningly strong. It was stronger than Han Sen fathomed it could be. Even the ultimate gold wing peacock king could not fight against it.

Boom!

In the next second, Han Sen was forced to tear through the restrictions of space. A scary power exploded through him. At the same time, he cast his Jadeskin and pointed toward the woman’s finger.

Two fingers collided against each other in the air. Two scary powers hit against each other. The ice, jade air did not create a scary explosion. It did not make a sound or a sonic wave.

It was like the two powers melted each other and disappeared.

“You come from another world,” the woman said to Han Sen with shock.

“Who are you?” Han Sen’s vision was like a knife. He looked at the woman in front of him. His full power attack had only been able to even out against that woman, so she was a terrifyingly strong person.

Plus, Han Sen was now able to confirm that the woman’s Cold Sutra had a problem. Her power could not really be counted as the Cold Sutra anymore. It was just like the Xuan Yellow Sutra. It was the Cold Sutra in reverse.

So, it counter-attacked his Jadeskin. When the two powers hit each other, they canceled each other out. “If you learned the Cold Sutra, you should know of the Witch race and Moon God,” the white-clothed woman coldly said.
