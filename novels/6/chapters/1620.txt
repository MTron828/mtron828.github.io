Chapter 1621: The Deal of Broken Shield

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Twelve-Winged Dark Seraphim

Before the creatures from Sacred arrived at the shelter, a group was already moving out of the shelter, led by Night Empress. Han Sen also saw Lotus Empress among the spirits and creatures, and he was happy.

“Sister Lotus is so lucky. She found her mom after she became a demigod,” Han Sen thought.

“Why did you come to my Night Shelter again?” Night Empress frowned and said to the statuesque creature called God-like.

God-like said to Night Empress calmly, “For the same reason we came before. If you’re willing to help us search for God’s Ruin, you can name any terms you want. Anything Sacred can give you, we will.”

God-like seemed to be making a generous offer, but that was not the case at all. While he was explicitly saying that the price was flexible, he was implying that Night Empress shouldn’t ask for too much as they were from Sacred shelter.

“I might let you down. I’m not powerful enough to help you guys,” said Night Empress without any facial expression.

“Empress, please reconsider. If you help us, you’ll make yourself a friend of Sacred shelter, and when you’re in trouble in the future, Sacred shelter will definitely come to your aid.” God-like continued.

“What if I don’t help you?” Night Empress looked cold.

“Then you’ll make yourself an enemy of Sacred, and I don’t think that’s a good choice.” God-like spoke softly, but his voice was full of threat.

“These tactics fit Sacred’s reputation. I’m either a friend or a foe,” said Night Empress, her voice hard.

“What’s your decision?” God-like asked. He didn’t bother to argue against what Night Empress had said.

Night Empress frowned. Though she was already an empress, she didn’t have a strong foundation. Compared to Sacred shelter, which had existed in the Fourth Sanctuary for a long time, her shelter was nothing.

Night Empress was very angry inside, however, and she had some serious considerations. Even if she wasn’t afraid of death, many creatures followed her in the shelter, including her daughter Lotus, who she loved more than everyone in the world. If Sacred really wanted to attack her, she didn’t have the power to defend against them.

Seeing that Night Empress wasn’t speaking, God-like then said, “Empress, it’s better to have a friend than to have an enemy, right? If you just help us this time, you’ll have the friendship of Sacred shelter forever. It’s mutually beneficial, isn’t it?”

Suddenly, a voice came from the nearby, which dazed both Night shelter and Sacred shelter. “It’s not a good thing to be friends with Sacred.”

When they turned to where the voice came from, they saw a human being walking out across the grass. And then, Lotus Empress and God-like almost screamed at the same time.

However, one of them shouted out “Han Sen” while the other one shouted “Skysword.”

“It’s been a long time, sister Lotus. You’re just as beautiful as ever,” Han Sen said to Lotus Empress with a smile. He then turned around and said to Night Empress, “Greetings, Empress.”

“I can’t believe it. You’ve grown so fast.” Night Empress had already recognized Han Sen, and she looked over him. She found that she couldn’t even feel his lifeforce, which made his presence feel strange and mysterious.

“Skysword, this has nothing to do with you. I hope that you won’t interfere.” God-like looked at Han Sen and frowned.

Previously, God-like wouldn’t even have given Han Sen a second look. However, after Han Sen slashed his way out of Outer Sky shelter all by himself, everyone was amazed by his power. Even God-like, a berserk super creature who came from Sacred, didn’t dare to underestimate Han Sen. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A creature who fought the master of Outer Sky and made it out of Outer Sky shelter alive should be respected, whether he was a human or a creature.

“Lotus Empress is my sister, while Night Empress is the mother of my sister, so she’s like a mother to me. Tell me, do you really think this has nothing to do with me?” said Han Sen calmly.

“Skysword, are you really going to make yourself an enemy of Sacred?” God-like’s face looked blue now. Though Han Sen was very renowned, God-like was reluctant to give up attacking God’s Ruin because of Han Sen.

“I should ask you this. Does Sacred really want you to make an enemy of me?” asked Han Sen calmly.

God-like looked very conflicted. He kept staring at Han Sen without saying anything.

“Why are you talking so much with him, young master? Just swallow him,” said the large dragon, which was also staring at Han Sen.

God-like waved his hand to silence the large dragon. He stared at Han Sen and said, “If you really want to interfere, then you and I can make an agreement. We can fight each other, and if you lose, you’ll have to leave immediately, and you have to promise that you’ll never interfere with any of the business of Sacred shelter anymore. And from now on, wherever people from Sacred show up, you have to leave.”

“What if I win?” Han Sen asked God-like.

“If you win, then we’ll leave immediately and never set foot in Night Shelter anymore,” said God-like calmly.

“Okay, you’ve got yourself a deal.” Killing them wouldn’t be difficult for Han Sen, but doing so would bring trouble to Night and Lotus.

God-like didn’t say anything more. He summoned a shield and held it in his hands. He said to Han Sen, “I hear that you have a terrific shield. Let’s see who has the better shield. Neither of us is going to dodge each other, and we’ll only attack each other with our shields. Whoever crushes the shield of their opponent will be the winner. What do you think of that?”

God-like made such a suggestion because he was kind of intimidated by Han Sen. After all, Han Sen fought the master of Outer sky and survived. Though he didn’t know exactly what happened in there, he still didn’t want to risk anything.

“Okay.” Han Sen didn’t hesitate at all. He summoned his overbearing shield

When God-like heard Han Sen agree to his proposal, he looked happy.

God-like was already a berserk super creature, and the shield was his geno core. When it came to defense, God-like was certain that his shield geno core could be ranked in the top three.

His shield was called Eternal Shield, and it was invincible. It had gone through many battles at all levels, and even great beings at emperor level couldn’t break the Eternal Shield.

God-like was exhilarated that Han Sen would agree to his terms that easily. God-like was confident that he was halfway to winning.

As for Night Empress, she was already familiar with God-like. After hearing what God-like proposed, she reminded Han Sen, “Han Sen, his shield is called Eternal Shield. He’s ranked twenty-eighth on the ranking of super geno cores, and he’s definitely one of the top three on defense. You need to be careful.”
