Chapter 3270 Asking Heart

“I will bring him back,” Zhao Ning’er said with a frown. “He cannot run far.” “I do not need him anymore,” Bury Path God coldly said. His body developed a demonic presence as the sky went dark. Zhao Ning’er looked as if she was being isolated from the outside world. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Zhao Ning’er’s eyes froze. She stared at Bury Path God as she said, “Bury Path God, this is the capital of the Zhao Kingdom. If you dare do anything here, the guardian God Spirit will smite you with its wrath.”

Bury Path God did not move. He walked toward Zhao Ning’er and said, “I have plunged this planet into an abyss. Not even a sky full of God Spirits will be able to figure what is going on here now.”

Zhao Ning’er’s face changed. She pulled Zhao Qiu Yi behind her. She looked at Bury Path God and said, “You cannot kill me, and there is no benefit for you killing me either. I can complete our deal and get Han Sen back.”

“Killing you might not benefit me, but your life soul has matured. It is time to get it back. As for Han Sen, if he has run, you will never be able to get another chance.” Bury Path God kept approaching at a slow pace. The whole world was buried by his oppressive footsteps. They elicited extreme pressure and fear. Zhao Ning’er felt as if she could not breathe. Zhao Qiu Yi, however, was on the floor as if she had been physically crushed.

If it was not for Zhao Ning’er being there, Zhao Qiu Yi’s body would have been completely crushed by the scary pressure.

Zhao Ning’er knew this fight could not be avoided. She did not want Zhao Qiu Yi to deal with the pressure. Therefore, she shouted and made a scary presence envelope her body. She was like a god woman shouting at Bury Path God.

“Let me ask you, Bury Path God, how heavy is the sky?”

A raging god sound turned into a weird power. It went straight to Bury Path God. It was like it was bumping into his body, stopping Bury Path God from moving.

Bury Path God was emotionless. He coldly answered, “Your asking heart power is surprisingly useful, but it does not work on me. Stop wasting your time.”

“Bury Path God, let me ask you again. How heavy is the sky?” Zhao Ning’er gnashed her teeth and used the asking heart language.

A weird power wrapped up Bury Path God. It made Bury Path God stop. He could not keep going. The world-breaking came to an end.

Bury Path God coldly looked at Zhao Ning’er and said, “Thirty-three.”

After that, Bury Path God walked forward and kept approaching Zhao Ning’er. “Blergh!” Zhao Ning’er spat out blood. The asking heart power backfired, but she was already prepared for that. She knew Bury Path God would have an answer. “What is above the 33 skies?” Zhao Ning’er exploded with god light. This time, she was scarier. A weird power broke the rules of the world and landed on Bury Path God. He stopped again. “Above the 33 skies is Outer Sky,” Bury Path God answered. With a sense of overbearing, he continued marching forward. He was 10 steps away from Zhao Ning’er at this point.

Zhao Ning’er coughed up more blood. Her body started to crack. Blood seeped out through the gaps. Her nose started to bleed. The asking heart language started to consume her again.

“What is above Outer Sky?” As Zhao Ning’er’s spoke, her hair became a wild mess that started to float and fly. God light exploded once more while she asked the question.

“Above 33 is Yin...” Bury Path God didn’t stop. He stepped forward when he spoke the first word. The crushing world was coming closer to Zhao Ning’er.

Zhao Ning’er was bleeding from seven orifices. Her asking heart power needed her to ask difficult questions to stop the opponent so they could turn that person into a mud man.

If the opponent’s heart was fine and unrattled, leading to them being able to provide an answer to her question, the asking heart power was useless.

She asked three questions, yet she was unable to stop Bury Path God. It resulted in her being the one wounded. It was a really terrible state of affairs.

“Big Sister... I am sorry... I was wrong...” Zhao Qiu Yi regretted things very much. If it was not for her letting Han Sen go, Zhao Ning’er would not be suffering.

“This has nothing to do with you,” Zhao Ning’er said. “It looks like he wants to kill me anyway. Even if you had given me Han Sen, he would still be doing this. Qiu Yi, you should just run.” She forced herself to use Break World powers. She used the asking heart language against Bury Path God. “What is above the Yin world?”

“My heart can go through you. From ancient times to now, the universe’s 10 billion years are in one thought. Your asking heart power does not work on me. You should stop wasting time.” Bury Path God did not answer. He drew an item.

It was the size of a ping-pong ball. It was an egg that looked like a crystal. A flame-like fire was inside of it.

Bury Path God used his fingertip to point at the egg. He mumbled some mysterious chanting spells and conjured some weird power inside his finger, which he then put onto the gene egg.

Boom!

The gene egg’s fire blew up with a ravaging flame that burned. It wrapped up the whole gene egg. “Argh!” Zhao Ning’er suddenly screamed and was kneeling on the floor. She went on all fours as a Break World power exploded madly. Her body was affected by the power and started to change. Her black hair turned white. Her small ears became long and sharp. Her back displayed snow-white wings. Her armor exploded. Her skin had white feathers.

“Big Sister, what has happened to you?” Zhao Qiu Yi touched Zhao Ning’er, but she could not ease her pain and revert her status.

Zhao Ning’er unleashed screams that could break hearts and one’s lungs. Her body kept morphing. She turned from a human into a white bird.

Bury Path God looked at Zhao Ning’er change. He spoke to himself, “Did this test subject succeed?”

A shocking sky bird sound shocked the sky. Zhao Ning’er’s body became a completely white god bird. Her entire body burned with a mysterious flame. She was like a phoenix that was born from a fire.

Bury Path God was holding a gene egg. The fire looked like the shadow of Zhao Ning’er. She flapped her wings and flew around the interior of the gene egg.

It seemed to reflect whatever the gene egg did. Zhao Ning’er’s god bird started to fly. It blew Zhao Qiu Yi away. She flew into the sky.

“Come. The Break World beast... Asking heart...” Bury Path God’s eyes were on fire. He raised the gene egg in his hands.

It seemed to be drawn by some power. Zhao Ning’er’s god bird flew toward the gene egg in Bury Path God’s hands. It was like a moth flying to a flame.

“Big Sister... No...” Zhao Qiu Yi was crying so hard that it seemed like she would tear up her lungs or heart. She crawled forward, wanting to chase Zhao Ning’er’s god bird. Alas, she could not. Hearing Zhao Qiu Yi cry, the god bird stopped. It stopped flying to the gene egg. It looked like it was wrestling with indecision.

“Come. You will be the strongest creature in the universe. How beautiful is this life? This is what you should have.” Bury Path God looked excited. He put more power into his gene egg. The shadows were on the gene egg. They were wrapped up by the flaming god bird.

Zhao Ning’er looked as if she was struggling. She looked to be in a lot of pain. Her eyes bled bloody tears, but her body flew to the gene egg.
