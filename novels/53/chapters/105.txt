Chapter 106: Meeting Some Bitches

“Uh, excuse me, the lady over here has already picked this outfit.” The shop assistant reminded apologetically.

The woman who had snatched the outfit was the lady dressed in Chanel. Hearing so, she raised her chin unhappily, “Then has she paid for it?”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“This, she has yet to do so…”

“It doesn’t belong to anyone before it’s paid for. I want this, ring it up for me right now!” The lady in Chanel ordered as if it was a matter of course.

Just as she had finished speaking, her hands were suddenly empty as the clothes flew back into Ning Xi’s hands.

The lady in Chanel was immediately in a rage, “Why are you snatching my clothes!”

Ning Xi’s tone was even more matter-of-course, “Didn’t you say that it doesn’t belong to anyone before it’s paid for? You can snatch it away, but others can’t?”

“You…” The lady in Chanel was about to throw a hissy fit, but she suddenly stared at Ning Xi’s face in bewilderment, “Ning Xi… are you Ning Xi?”

As if she had found something funny, the lady in Chanel pulled her companion over, “Xuanxuan, look who it is! It’s that bumpkin from the Ning family, she’s actually snatching clothes from me at a place like this!”

“Ning Xi? How can it be…” Her companion looked at the woman before her with surprise. Her black hair fell in loose waves down her back, her makeup was perfectly done, and although the light purple sleeveless dress wasn’t branded, it fit her personality well. Her whole person carried an elegant and noble air. There wasn’t a single trace left of the weak country bumpkin from back then.

“It is her! I would never forget her face. Once a country bumpkin, always a country bumpkin. She only changed her appearance a little, but she still looks shoddy as always!” The lady in Chanel said confidently.

Her companion sized up the woman and found that it was indeed Ning Xi. Actually, Ning Xi’s looks weren’t too bad, even back then. She just didn’t know how to dress herself and always looked rustic. The clothes she had been wearing at the banquet had been a size bigger, with a colour that was out of style. It was even a counterfeit dress, so it left a deep impression.

“What’s she doing buying children’s clothes? I didn’t hear of her marrying anyone!”

“Who know if it’s some random man’s bastard. Maybe she got pregnant before marriage! Back then, didn’t Su Yan dump her because she cheated on him with some other guy?”

……

It was only after those two women had been talking back and forth for a long while that Ning Xi finally recalled who they were.

The lady in Chanel was Ying Fanglin and her companion was Jin Xuanxuan. They were famous socialites in upper society and part of Ning Xueluo’s group of close friends. These two were also the ones who had mocked and teased her the most back then.

She had later heard that Fanglin had married well and given birth to a son for her husband in the first year. Thus, she had become even more arrogant in her actions. Jin Xuanxuan also had a fiance with a good family background.

She hadn’t thought that she would meet these bitches in the children’s clothing department.

It seemed like they still didn’t know that she had entered the entertainment industry. Ning Xi didn’t want to fight with these guys in public, so she just ignored them and spoke to the shop assistant: “Miss, please help me ring these up.”

Although the other two ladies seemed like the wrong people to offend, since Ning Xi had picked the outfit first, the shop assistant quickly helped her to ring up the items and swipe her card.

However, a problem arose when it came to swiping her card.

The shop assistant’s expression turned a little ugly, “I’m sorry, miss, you don’t have enough balance left on your card.”

“Ah?” Ning Xi was struck dumb.

It was only then that Ning Xi remembered, she had just changed the engine on her beloved bike to an imported one just last month, so there wasn’t much money left on her card…

Seeing the situation, Ying Fanglin immediately jeered without restraint, “Hahaha, this is hilarious! You tried to show off when you don’t have any money… you’re just making a fool of yourself!”

Jin Xuanxuan shrugged in disdain, “I thought she might have improved a little after studying overseas for these few years. Well, I guess a crow will always be a crow, she’ll never become a swan!”

Puffed up with self-importance, Ying Fanglin looked towards the shop assistant, “Miss, you can finally give me the clothes now, right?”

“Yes, madam!” As the shop assistant said so, she tried to take the clothes in Ning Xi’s hands.

Ning Xi held on and refused to let go.

Ying Fanglin immediately cried out, “What are you doing? You don’t have any money and you’re still trying to snatch it from me? Did you think that you’re still in your village?”

Ning Xi held onto the clothes with one hand and used her free hand to take out a black card from her bag, handing it over to the shop assistant, “Use this one.”
