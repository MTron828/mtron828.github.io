She carefully moved off the bed to see what had happened since little bun was sleeping very soundly.

She saw Lu Tingxiao pouring some water to drink after pushing open the bedroom door. One hand was covering his stomach and his face looked pale.

Ning Xi hurriedly went over, “Mister Lu, are you ok?”

“Nothing big.”

“Hmm, does your stomach hurt?”

Lu Tingxiao didn’t reply.

Ning Xi knew that she had guessed right.

Lu Tingxiao actually couldn’t eat spicy things. Yet why would he attempt to eat anyways?

“Wait a bit, I’ll get you some stomach medicine.”

Fortunately, she had the most common medicines at home.

Ning Xi hurriedly brought over the stomach medicine, “You have to eat both pills.”

“Thank you.” Lu Tingxiao took the pills from her palm. His slightly cold fingers grazing lightly on her palm felt as if they were grazing the tip of her heart. It suddenly made her feel weak.

In the still quiet of the windy and stormy night, it was too easy to lose control with this kind of beauty in front of her!

Ning Xi silently chanted the digits of Pi until she could calm her heart down.

Looking at Lu Tingxiao eating the medicine, she accompanied him for a while since it wasn’t polite to leave immediately.

“Are you a little better now? Do you need to go to the hospital? I’m sorry, I didn’t know you couldn’t eat spicy foods……”

Originally she was worried about little bun. In the end nothing happened to little bun, but something happened to Lu Tingxiao instead! What would this be called……

“Not your fault, it’s just an old problem.”

Lu Tingxiao suddenly opened his mouth after the two were silent for a bit: “The reason for intruding on your hospitality tonight was because Little Treasure wanted to see you.”

Ning Xi wasn’t sure if he’d made a slip of the tongue, “Little Treasure wanted to see me?”

“Little Treasure had suffered a big fright in the warehouse. He’s very reliant on you now since you saved him.” Lu Tingxiao explained.

Ning Xi found that as long as Little Treasure was nearby, or if someone brought up questions regarding Little Treasure, the piercing cold atmosphere around Lu Tingxiao would weaken a lot. He wasn’t as scary as was earlier during daytime.

“So it was like this……”Ning Xi nodded her head.

This kind of night was easy to cause people to let down their defenses and reservations. Ning Xi asked a question that had been bothering her for a while, “Umm, taking the liberty to ask. Does Little Treasure not know how to speak?”

Even up until today, she had never heard Little Treasure utter a single word. The little fellow would only nod or shake his head.

“More so than not knowing how to talk, he doesn’t want to talk.” Lu Tingxiao answered.

“Then it’s a problem of the heart?” Ning Xi frowned.

“Little Treasure is a bit closed off. He tends to shut himself away.” Lu Tingxiao didn’t hide anything.

“It’s like this……”It was pretty much what she had guessed.

As to why Little Treasure would shut himself away, this kind of rich family’s secret, she naturally would not dare to ask about more deeply.

“Miss Ning.” Lu Tingxiao suddenly focused his gaze on her. Those eyes were bright, cold and calm. Yet it gave her a feeling of being so fiery that it would burn a body into ashes.

“Yes?” Ning Xi gave a slight start at the gaze.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Have we met somewhere before?” Lu Tingxiao asked.

If these words were spoken by someone else, Ning Xi would definitely think the other side was trying to strike up a conversation. Using an obsolete/old way at that too. But the person speaking was Lu Tingxiao, the bewilderment in his eyes were real.

“We probably haven’t. Even if I had seen Mr. Lu before, there’s no way I wouldn’t have an impression…but is there some problem?” Ning Xi’s tone was still considered firm. With her status, she couldn’t have met a person at Lu Tingxiao’s level. That would be the case even when she was still the Ning family’s young miss.

“Nothing.” Lu Tingxiao shifted his gaze, his eyes reflecting the deep color of the night outside the window. He seemed a bit lonely.

The atmosphere seemed to be going a little bad as they continued to interact like this!

“Mister Lu, if you don’t have anything else, then I’ll go to sleep first?” Ning Xi carefully said.

It seemed as if Lu Tingxiao had seen through her. He raised his hand, “No hurries, sit.”

Not in a hurry?! She was in a very big hurry, ok!
