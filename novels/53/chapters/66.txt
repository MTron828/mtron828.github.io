Chapter 67: Kiss Under the Moonlight

In the Lu residence.

After returning to the room and changing into her own pajamas, Ning Xi flew like a lightning bolt and ran to find the little bun.

“Little Treasure, Auntie’s a little scared of the dark today, can I sleep with you?”

The little bun was extremely welcoming, of course. He happily gave up more than half the space on his bed for her.

“Thank you darling~ Good night darling~”

You’re this auntie’s protection amulet, I’m going to count on you to save my life tonight…

Everything that had happened today had been too exciting. Her little heart was still beating rapidly even now.

After today’s events, she could feel that the thin, hazy barrier between her and Lu Tingxiao had become so fragile that it could break with a single touch…

If it really did break, then she really wouldn’t know what to do then…

Luckily, the little bun in her embrace served as a great sedative. After her heart thumped for half an hour, she slowly fell asleep…

Ning Xi had the little bun as her sedative, but someone was finding it hard to sleep alone. In the late night, the smoke in the study had become so thick that it was like heavy fog.

Heh, no wonder Cheng Feng had not been able to find the identities of the two people who had sent Ning Xi those gifts that day on set. One of them was actually a hidden traitor…

Corrupted Devil King…

It was only now that he recalled that they had a family group chat, and Jiang Muye used this strange nickname there. He hadn’t connected the dots together previously.

As for the man who signed off as YS, there were no leads as of yet…

In the dark, the man stubbed his cigarette, stood up and left the room.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He pushed the door of the guest room lightly, and saw that it was empty.

Lu Tingxiao’s brows shifted slightly. He turned and looked to the room next door.

As expected, Ning Xi was hugging Little Treasure and sleeping soundly.

This girl was pretty clever.

However, did she really think that they were done just like that?

Lu Tingxiao walked up to the small bed, and lightly took away the little hand that Little Treasure was using to grab onto her clothes. He swapped in a soft toy, then directly carried Ning Xi away.

While in dreamland, Little Treasure frowned and his little hand searched around for something, before grabbing onto the plush.

After he had finished deceiving his son, Lu Tingxiao directly brought her to the master bedroom.

With gentle motions, he placed her on the bed, then sat by the bedside. He gently caressed the girl’s silken locks with slightly callused hands, then her eyes, and her cheeks…

Like a beast before its meal, he was extremely patient, yet relishing this moment before the meal.

Finally, he gave a sigh and covered those soft lips with his own; dipping in, exploring, melding their mouths together. It was as sweet as he had imagined.

He then moved to her cheeks, her earlobes, and slid across her neck. Finally, he stopped at her collarbone…

In the past 32 years of his life, he had never fallen in love with anybody, and had thought that love was meaningless to him. To him, romantic love was probably the most useless thing. So what if he had no lust and no love? Did it really matter that much anyway?

He had never thought that love would, one day, barge into his life in this manner. This girl who was 8 years younger, had made him complete.

Life was no longer about cold plans and hard numbers, but it was filled with softness, longing, warmth, sweetness, satisfaction…

Accompanying those, however, were anger, ruthlessness, impulsiveness, desire…

Upon thinking of the scene he had seen at Jiang Muye’s place, the ruthless side of him immediately leapt out of its cage. He unconsciously applied more pressure, and in the next second, the smell of blood blossomed between their interlocked lips…

The girl beneath him frowned and Lu Tingxiao’s back stiffened. However, he only watched her smack her lips before she returned to deep slumber. Completely heartless and thoughtless.

Lu Tingxiao used his fingertip to touch her moist, swollen lips. Fire burned in his pupils and he had the urge to ignore all consequences and wake her up with a kiss…
