Chapter 109: Don’t Bring Men Back Home

He hadn’t expected that she would make such a request. Lu Tingxiao’s expression clearly turned blank for a moment before he stared at the girl’s back. His tone was slightly higher than usual, “Why?”

Although he was pretty happy to fulfill this kind of request from this little girl.

Realising that there were too many ways to interpret her words, Ning Xi hurriedly corrected, “Please don’t misunderstand! I meant exactly what I said, there’s no other meaning to it! Uh, actually that seems quite lewd as well… Ahem, basically what I meant was, I bought an outfit for you while shopping today, would you like to try it on? If you try it on now, you don’t have to take off your clothes again to try it on! Aren’t I smart!”

Lu Tingxiao looked slightly startled upon hearing so, and he looked overwhelmed by the unexpected favour, “You bought something for me?”

He had thought that she had bought the outfits for Little Treasure.

“Yes! However, ahem, I used your card!” Ning Xi rubbed her nose awkwardly, “Actually I was prepared to use my own money at first, since it’s a present for Little Treasure. I forgot that I bought a new engine for my bike last month, so there’s no more money left on my card. I could only use your card. Anyway, when I was passing by another shop, I saw another men’s outfit that looked extremely matching with the one I bought for Little Treasure, so I couldn’t help but buy it!”

“So it was like that.” Although she hadn’t bought it specially for him, it was enough to make him happy.

“I asked the shop assistant, you can return it if you don’t like it. Quickly try it on and see if you like it!” Ning Xi urged him.

Lu Tingxiao said without hesitation: “I like it.” She had bought it personally and it was the first time she had bought clothes for him. How could he not like it?

“You haven’t seen how it looks yet!” Ning Xi mumbled and moved a step backwards, reaching behind her back to pass one of the bags in her hands to him.

Lu Tingxiao received the bag, “You only bought clothes for Little Treasure and me? Did you not anything for yourself at all?”

Ning Xi sighed, “Ah, I’m broke, so I’m going to wait till I get my salary before I go shopping again!”

Lu Tingxiao was about to say that she could just use his card, when Ning Xi took out said black card from her bag, “Oh right, I’ll return this to you! It felt pretty cool when I used it! I was almost angered to death by a bitch who wanted to snatch clothes from me today!”

Lu Tingxiao could only sigh lightly and say, “Keep it first. I’m usually busy and I don’t have the time to shop for Little Treasure. If you see anything appropriate, just buy it. Of course, I’d be delighted if you helped me pick something as well.”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You’re placing so much trust in my fashion sense? As long as you don’t change your mind after you try on the outfit later!” Ning Xi didn’t bother standing on ceremony with him and just kept the card again, “Then I’ll return it to you when I leave! Change quickly, I’m going out first!”

She was about to take a step when her empty hand was grabbed by the man from behind.

Ning Xi jumped in surprise. She subconsciously wanted to turn around, but after remembering that Lu Tingxiao was only wearing a towel, she could only maintain that awkward position of having her hand pulled from behind, “What’s wrong?”

Lu Tingxiao tightened his hold on her slender wrist, “Ning Xi, Little Treasure has been getting better recently. He’s no longer clinging to you and he has become much more obedient than before. He won’t bother you and he won’t disturb your work. He only wants to see you everyday, wait for you to return home. He’s really really happy knowing that you’re sleeping right next door…”

“I know that I don’t have any more reasons to keep you, but as a father, I can’t do much for Little Treasure. I really hope that Little Treasure can stay this happy for a while longer.”

“Three months. Just stay three more months, please? When the time comes for you to go, I absolutely won’t pressure you to stay anymore. Within that period, you can treat this place like your own home. Do as you like, you don’t have to be apprehensive.”

“It’s fine if you curse when you’re angry, if you eat durians or garlic, you can also drink at bars until late… I only have a small request. Within these three months, could you exercise a little restraint? Just don’t bring men back, okay?”

At the start, Ning Xi had been so touched she had almost cried. However, at the end, she almost puked up three litres of blood.

Why did it end up sounding like Lu Tingxiao was the gentle, loving and obedient wife, while she was the scummy husband immersing herself in debauchery?
