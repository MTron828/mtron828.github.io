Chapter 118: Meeting Between Ex-Boyfriends

Ning Xi was too lazy to type, so she just sent a voice message over, “Mr Lu, I have a dinner with the crew tonight. Could I trouble you to tell Little Treasure not to wait for me for dinner?”

With a whoosh, Lu Tingxiao had already sent his reply, and it was also a voice message.

Ning Xi tapped on the voice message, and Lu Tingxiao’s cold yet caring voice sounded from the phone: “Okay, have fun.”

“Ning Xiao Xi…” Jiang Muye called her name sinisterly.

“What?”

“You’re not only blind, even your ears are going deaf! Don’t you think the tone my uncle uses when talking to you is a little strange?”

“Jiang Muye, are you itching for a beating?”

“…” Jiang Muye firmly decided not to say anything more. Hehe, Ning Xiao Xi, just you wait. By tonight, I’m definitely going to find some conclusive evidence to make you believe it. You. Better. Believe. It!

At the Grand Pearl Hotel.

Almost all the crew had been gathered for this dinner. Even Ning Xueluo and the other actors who didn’t have scenes to film today had rushed over.

Everyone welcomed Jiang Muye enthusiastically, and the atmosphere in the private dining room was very warm.

After three rounds of drinks, Amy suddenly picked up her wineglass and stood up, “Ning Xi, I misunderstood you last time. I’m dedicating this toast to you, take it as my apology and my thanks to you!”

“Amy-jie, you’re being too courteous!” Ning Xi returned the toast by downing the rest of the wine in her glass.

Everyone cheered in agreement, and following that, quite a few of them also toasted Ning Xi. Ning Xi didn’t refuse any toasts, and settled all the grudges by drinking.

Seeing Ning Xi getting along so well with the crew, Ning Xueluo put on a gratified smile, “I told you that my junior wasn’t that kind of person!”

As the dinner was coming to a close, a slender figure knocked on the door and walked in.

“Aiyah, Young Master Su!”

“Young Master Su is here!”

“Yan-gege, why are you here?” Seeing the new arrival, Ning Xueluo immediately welcomed him with an expression of joyful surprise.

……

In the corner, the drunk Jiang Muye immediately woke up. His gaze was like a torch as he stared at the man dressed in a white suit standing at the door and giving off a refined aura.

Su Yan!

That was Su Yan?

The only man that Ning Xi was rumoured to have loved?

As a perfect boyfriend, Su Yan would always appear at occasions where Ning Xueluo needed some support. At this moment, Ning Xueluo was clinging onto his arm as he greeted everyone with a warm expression, “I was eating here with some friends and I heard from Xueluo that all of you were here too. Order whatever you’d like to eat, this dinner will be my treat!”

Everyone roared together:

“Wow! Young Master Su’s too rich!”

“It feels like we’re always riding on Teacher Ning’s coattails!”

“Then we’re not going to be courteous!”

……

At this moment, a cold snort came from the corner, “This is my welcome dinner, why are you the one treating me? I’m paying for this dinner!”

It was most likely because he was meeting another of Ning Xi’s exes, but once Su Yan had appeared, Jiang Muye showed undisguised hostility.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Men were always sensitive to hostility from other men. Su Yan detected Jiang Muye’s unfriendly attitude towards him from the start. However, his face held a warm smile as he spoke unhurriedly, “Since it’s Mr Jiang’s welcome dinner, then by right, Mr Jiang shouldn’t be the one to pay for it at all.”

“That’s right, let us treat this round! Think of it as our hospitality as your hosts.” Ning Xueluo supported.

What hospitality!? He was born and raised in the capital, alright? Who even needed them as hosts!

Jing Muye was going to use his drunkenness as an excuse to throw a tantrum when Ning Xi pressed on his shoulder from behind and whispered in his ear, “Are you braindead? There’s a guy who has more money than common sense, why not use him? Let him pay!”

When Jiang Muye heard that, his expression turned uglier, “Hmph, are you sure you’re not speaking up for him? That’s your ex-lover right there!”

Ning Xi raised a brow, “Aren’t you my ex-lover too?”
