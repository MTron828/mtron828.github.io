Chapter 154: Older Sister, Please Calm Down

“What if I don’t agree?” Ning Xi looked at him with a faint smile.

Zhang Qiang’s wretched gaze alternated between her bust and buttocks before he rubbed his chin and said, “If you don’t have money… then there’s still another way! If Miss Great Beauty Ning is willing to sleep with me once, then I might even be able to reveal some interesting hints!”

This was clearly hinting to her that she had to pay up or sleep with him if she wanted his statement.

In reality, with Zhang Qiang’s deceitful personality, there was a great chance that he wouldn’t give the statement even after satisfying his requests. By then, it would likely be a loss on both fronts for Ning Xi.

At the same time, in the car downstairs.

Seeing such a scene from the cameras, Lu Jingli was anxiously reminding his brother over the call, “Bro, calm down! Don’t get too stirred up! Please don’t get too excited! Treat my little lappie gently! I have a few hundred gigabytes of treasures in my hard disk!”

“Go upstairs. Right now.” A command rang out over the earpiece.

“Yes yes yes! I’m going right now!” Seeing that Zhang Qiang had already started walking closer to Ning Xi, Lu Jingli carried his laptop and started sprinting.

At the same time, Zhang Qiang walked in front of Ning Xi’s chair and placed his arms on the armrests. Even his breathing had quickened, “How is it? Isn’t this deal worth it? You get what you want, and you can even enjoy yourself!”

Ning Xi lowered her gaze. Her expression was hidden in the shadows and couldn’t be seen clearly. A light sigh spilled forth from her dark red lips.

In the next second, Zhang Qiang felt something cold and hard press against his waist. Looking down, his face immediately turned pale—— it was the pitch-dark barrel of a gun pressing against him.

“You… you you…” Zhang Qiang’s first reaction was to run.

However, Ning Xi’s sinisterly cold voice rang out from behind him, “Go ahead and run. Let’s see if you can run faster than my bullets.”

Zhang Qiang’s sweat poured down like rain. He turned about stiffly and smiled in a relaxed manner, “Girl, I was almost scared by you! Trying to use a toy gun to trick me? Then shoot! If you have the guts, then shoot! Come on, shoot over here!”

Ning Xi’s fingers moved slightly as she installed a silencer onto the barrel with a click. She then pressed on the trigger——

With a ‘pfft’, the bullet grazed against Zhang Qiang’s arm, then scratched out a line of eye-piercing sparks on the floor.

When she finished taking action, not even three seconds had passed.

Zhang Qiang held onto the wound burning painfully on his arm, and knelt to the ground with a thump, “Older sister! O great sister! Please calm down! That’s a real gun! It’s not for playing around!”

“Your statement.” Ning Xi tossed a recorder pen over. She looked at the time on her phone with an extremely impatient expression.

Little Treasure was still sleeping at home. He would definitely be worried if he woke up early and she wasn’t there, so she had to hurry back to accompany Little Treasure.

“I’ll do it, I’ll do it! I’ll record it right now!” Zhang Qiang hurriedly crawled over to pick up the recorder pen. He turned it on and started recording all by himself.

“It wasn’t Ning Xi! It wasn’t Ning Xi who bribed me! There’s someone else who paid me to tamper with the sword! But I don’t know who it was! I received an anonymous email and the sender just told me to execute the instructions in the email, and even sent me $100,000 as a deposit. They said that they would give me another $100,000 after I finished the task!” Zhang Qiang carefully stole glances at Ning Xi while speaking.

The woman in front of him had an extremely impatient and dark expression. Her pupils were slightly red as her fingers caressed the barrel of the gun. She looked like a mad, homicidal maniac; his hairs were about to stand from looking at her appearance.
