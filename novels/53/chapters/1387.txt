After Lu Tingxiao left, Mo Jiangzhang, Kang Shuhui, and Kang Wanru walked out of the doctor’s office.

The atmosphere was heavy. They did not look at Mo Lingtian who was still motionless on the bench.

“Wanru, be honest with me. How severe is it?” Kang Shuhui asked nervously while Ning Xi frowned.

Kang Wanru sighed, “Chief Liang already said clearly. I have nothing else to add. Under this situation, there’s almost no chance for her to get pregnant again. She’s already very fortunate to be able to keep her uterus!”

Kang Shuhui kept on crying and blaming herself, “Oh no… What should we do?”

Mo Jianzhang looked at Ning Xi. “Miss Ning, we’re really grateful for you. If it wasn’t for you… Oh, wait, does her family know about this already? Should we tell them? It’s such a serious matter after all…”

Ning Xi shook her head. “There’s no need. My grandfather isn’t very well and he can’t take any shock. Sis Tianxin won’t want her mother to worry about her. As for my uncle, if he knows about this, I wonder what crazy things he’ll do… It’ll just make Sis Tianxin’s life difficult. I believe that’s what she doesn’t want at all!”

Ning Xi then hardened her tone, “Thank you for your concern over Sis Tianxin. I’ll let her know you guys stopped by. I’ll be taking care of her, so don’t you worry.”

Ning Xi tried her best to be polite but she was basically chasing them away.

Anyone from the Mo family could trigger Ning Tianxin who was already in such frail health.

“If there’s anything we can help with, please don’t hesitate to contact us.” Of course, Mo Jianzhang understood what she meant. He did not want to trouble her anymore. He then glared angrily at Mo Lingtian. “What are you sitting here for? Everything’s gone your way!”

Mo Lingtian did not move an inch as if he did not hear anything his father said.

Kang Shuhui was about to say something, but in the end, she did not. She simply shook her head and left.

It was not all Lingtian’s fault. They were at fault as well because they had been too impatient and did not listen to Tianxin’s explanation.

Tragically, it was all too late now. They could only try to make amends.

In just one night, their daughter-in-law had become a weak shell and their grandchild had disappeared. It was a really huge blow to them, and they both suddenly looked ten years older.

At the entrance of the hospital, Kang Shuhui wept sadly, “She’s such a nice girl! We’re not blessed enough to have her… We don’t deserve such a good daughter-in-law! I don’t care what you and Lingtian think. From now on, Tianxin is my daughter!”

…

After everyone went off, only Ning Xi and Mo Lingtian were left.

Mo Lingtian stood up and walked towards the door.

Ning Xi raised her leg and blocked his way.

“Let me take a look at her.”

“From now on, if you go near her, I’ll call you Grandfather!”

“Just a look.”

“What can you do by looking at her?”

Mo Lingtian could not say anything.

He did not know. He just wanted to see her… He was dying to see her…
