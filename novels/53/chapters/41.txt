Chapter 42: Good Night, My Girl

Ning Xi glared at the man like he was a big bad bully as she tried to recover from her coughing fit.

“Heh…” Lu Tingxiao laughed when he saw that little expression. His humour rippled in the depths of his eyes. He extinguished the cigarette butt and puffed out the smoke in his mouth before once again leaning over, tilting his head and covering her lips.

Ning Xi subconsciously tried to escape, but a palm held onto her twisting waist and a low voice coaxed temptingly at the sensitive edge of her ear, “I won’t let you choke this time.”

Having said so, an intense tobacco-flavoured kiss engulfed her consciousness…

Ning Xi was kissed until she was muddleheaded. Her mind was a mess, floating amidst the clouds.

The only thing clear to her was that, this man holding her with one arm, was even more dangerous than smoking.

With a bang, the seat behind her fell back, and following that was the man’s burning hot body.

Her breath was slowly being robbed from her, and Ning Xi slowly felt her consciousness grow even fuzzier and fuzzier until she finally sunk into the depths…

Sensing that there was no reaction from below him, Lu Tingxiao raised his head slightly and saw that a certain person was currently sleeping thoughtlessly, even snoring a little…

Lu Tingxiao’s reddened pupils suddenly recovered their normal black colour, and the rage in his heart completely disappeared.

Ha, he was really crazy, what was he doing getting angry at a drunk person…

It had only been three days.

Three days since they met.

Why was he being so hasty?

The attraction he had to this girl was completely irrational.

When he had first seen her, he had had a crazy feeling of recovering something he had lost.

It felt like she was an old friend even though it was their first meeting.

When he had picked her up in the storeroom of that bar, he had actually had the feeling of finding the thing he was missing in his life, like she was a treasure he had lost unknowingly.

He wanted to make her completely his right now.

However, he didn’t want to lose her, so he had to wait.

Lu Tingxiao retrieved a blanket and pillow from the back, adjusted the temperature of the air conditioning, then laid by her side and kissed her forehead.

“Good night, my girl.”

The next morning.

Ning Xi woke up in a warm embrace.

She raised a hand to rub her eyes, and saw patches of green leaves from the window above her head. Bright and beautiful sunlight was streaming through the gaps in the leaves and shining warmly on her body. There was even melodious chirping from the birds…

Erm, where was she?

Lowering her eyes to scan her surroundings, she was surprised to find that she was actually sleeping in a car. More accurately, sleeping in Lu Tingxiao’s embrace.

What. The. Heck!

Ning Xi frantically tried to get up, and hit her head on the roof of the car- it hurt so much that she gritted her teeth in pain.

She… Lu Tingxiao… in the car…

Damn it, what happened last night? Why was she in a situation like that the moment she woke up!?

It was hard not to misunderstand with the scene before her!

“What are you thinking?”

Ning Xi bit her finger anxiously, her mind was in a mess. She answered subconsciously: “I’m thinking whether I had sex in a car with the evil demon king while drunk last night, this is so scary…”

“Evil demon king… car sex…? If it were like you said, do you think you would have the strength to jump around and let your imagination run wild this morning?” From the man’s voice, you could tell that he was holding back his rage and gritting his teeth.

“AH-” Ning Xi belatedly found out that Lu Tingxiao had already woken up. She was so frightened that she jumped up and almost hit her head again. Luckily, Lu Tingxiao was already prepared and used his hand to protect the top of her head.

“Mr… Mr Lu…”

“Call me by my name.” Lu Tingxiao’s tone was slightly cool.

She would call him Mr Lu when she was trying to distance herself, and call him Master Lu when she was scared of him. He didn’t like it at all.

Ning Xi wondered if it was her misperception, but it seemed like something about Lu Tingxiao had changed in a single night…
