Chapter 112: Sister-in-Law is Unbelievable

Everyone’s first reaction was that Lu Tingxiao, the King of Eternal Lurking, had unexpectedly made a wild appearance in the family group chat.

Their second reaction was, dear God, this pair of father and son looked like they had just stepped out of a magazine!

They really wanted to steal Little Treasure and bring him home!

They also really wanted to give their daughters over in marriage!

If modern society didn’t prohibit marriage between close relatives, countless members of the family group chat who had daughters would have already killed themselves trying to make it happen.

“Oh my, my good grandson is so adorable. Oh my, my son is so handsome!” Mrs. Lu was so moved that she didn’t know who she should praise first.

“Tingxiao, who chose those clothes for you and Little Treasure? Was it that young woman you like?” At just one glance, Mrs. Lu noticed that those definitely did not conform to her son’s style.

“Yes.”

“I just knew you couldn’t possibly have chosen this style of clothing! Look at how bright the colours are! How good-looking! It’s nothing like the drab and boring clothing you wear all the time. You even made Little Treasure wear such drab and boring colours too! There’s no doubt about it, your household really needs a woman!”

“Were the pictures also taken by her?” Mr. Lu also couldn’t resist asking.

“Yes.” Once again, Lu Tingxiao responded with a single word.

“Not bad.” Mr. Lu was clearly very pleased.

Even as a child, Lu Tingxiao had hated getting his picture taken. Little Treasure hated getting his picture taken even more. Therefore, pictures of this father and son pair were extremely rare, and there were even fewer pictures of the two posing together. Acting in unison, both Mr. and Mrs. Lu silently saved the entire set of pictures.

“Damn, my future sister-in-law is unbelievable! She somehow managed to get you to wear clothing of this colour and had you obediently pose for pictures! I gave you a suit that was nearly identical to this one in colour and your expression was so disdainful. You even criticized my taste!” This time, Lu Jingli was the one to speak.

Since Lu Jingli had appeared, referring to the other party as ‘my future sister-in-law’, all the extended family members couldn’t endure it any longer. Everyone began an interrogation to figure out which family the girl that Lu Tingxiao fancied belonged to.

Lu Tingxiao immediately responded with two words, “Private matter.”

His meaning was, this is my private matter. No one is allowed to get involved.

Therefore, those who were getting ready to investigate the situation no longer dared to act rashly.

Lu Tingxiao stood at the helm of this large Lu family. His existence was akin to an emperor. The Lu family’s glory and honour and the Lu family’s respect and splendor were all dependent on him. Without a doubt, his words were like an imperial edict.

At that moment, there was another person who had seen the pictures and chat messages in the family group chat: Jiang Muye.

Jiang Muye stared unwaveringly at the words, “Was it that young woman you like?” After staring for a long time, he immediately sent Ning Xi a private message.

“Ning Xi, did you take pictures for Lu Tingxiao and Little Treasure?”

“Yeah. How did you know? Did you see us?” Ning Xi recalled that Jiang Muye also did not have any scenes to film today. She wondered to herself if this punk might have possibly snuck over again.

“Hmph, my uncle uploaded them to the family group chat to show off! Everyone is giving out compliments!”

Ning Xi immediately became happy and typed rapidly, “Hahaha, really? Are they complimenting me for taking good pictures?”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Muye was so angry that he almost threw his phone, “Could you focus on the main point here?”

“Then what should I be focusing on?”

“I’m telling you, just now…”

Jiang Muye originally wanted to say that Lu Tingxiao had just personally admitted in the group chat that the girl he liked had taken the pictures for him. However, after thinking about how he had already told her that three times previously, he decided suddenly that this evidence wasn’t strong enough. It was very likely he might even suffer another beating from her instead. Therefore, he decided that he might as well wait until he had found undeniable evidence that she could convince her completely.

“We have scenes together tomorrow. Don’t be late!” Jiang Muye changed the subject.

“When have I ever been late?!”

“It’ll be a kissing scene if everything goes according to plan. If there’s any whiff of garlic or durian from you tomorrow, you’re dead, got it?”
