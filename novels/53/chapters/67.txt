Chapter 68: I’m So Angry, But I Need to Keep My Smile On

Ning Xi slept all night until she woke up naturally the next morning.

She had slept so well last night that it felt like something wasn’t right. Why did a part of her tongue hurt? Did she bite herself while dreaming last night…?

Was it too savage that she had bitten herself…

At breakfast, everything was normal.

Seeing how Lu Tingxiao was dressed, it seemed like he was going back to work today. He was impeccably attired in Western-style clothing, sitting there like an aristocrat having his coffee and reading the newspapers. His expression was as cold and distant as usual, as if nothing had happened last night.

Ning Xi heaved a sigh of relief, and somehow felt that she was being too sensitive.

Lu Tingxiao might harbour some sort of vague feelings towards her, but it wasn’t to the point that he would get jealous for her, right? Especially with his own nephew…

Lu Tingxiao’s expression was rather normal, but the little bun’s was not.

Early in the morning, the little bun had been carrying a stiff expression and had been sulking about, as if someone had snatched something away from him.

Ning Xi placed a steamed dumpling in the little bun’s bowl and inquired caringly, “Darling, what happened? Are you unhappy?”

The little bun glanced at his dear daddy, who was pretending as if nothing had happened, and he grew even angrier. However, upon remembering that Auntie Xiao Xi loved seeing his smile the most, he worked hard to raise the corners of his lips, indicating that he was fine.

I’m so angry, but I need to keep my smile on!

After seeing this, Ning Xi finally stopped worrying. She quickly finished her breakfast, “Then I’m leaving first, both of you, take your time with eating!”

Today was the day the second male lead would be coming to the set. Thus, it would be best if she reached there early.

As she was about to take her bag and leave, little bun had walked to her side at some point, and his little hand gripped onto her clothes.

Ning Xi was confused, “What’s up?”

Seeing that she didn’t understand, the little bun’s face was full of grievance. With an expression as if he had lost her favour, he was about to cry out loud.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ning Xi scratched her head and thought for a long while, but couldn’t understand what she had done wrong. Finally, she could only send a pleading gaze for help to Lu Tingxiao.

Lu Tingxiao shot a glance at her, then reminded her in a calm tone, “You forgot to give him the goodbye kiss.”

“Oh oh oh sorry!” Ning Xi hit her head, and finally remembered.

Little Treasure waved bye to Auntie Xiao Xi, then turned around and faced his dear daddy, that cute little face immediately carried an extremely angry expression. He seemed to be saying, ‘Don’t think that you’re forgiven just because you helped me just now!’ with his expression.

Lu Tingxiao acted as if he didn’t notice his son’s anger, and sipped some coffee in a calm and collected manner, “Sorry, I don’t understand what you’re trying to say. If you want to talk to me, then speak up or write it out.”

Little Treasure was even angrier upon hearing so.

Even with Ning Xi’s help, his communication ability was only at the level of writing simple words, expressions and punctuation. He had never written a long sentence before, not to mention opening his mouth to speak.

Finally, filled with rage, he wrote a single word in English on his notepad: Thief.

Lu Tingxiao glanced at that word from the side of his eyes, and pretended not to understand, “What? We’ve been robbed?”

This time, Little Treasure was so mad that his cheeks were puffed up. Burying his head into his notepad, he wrote quite a few words agitatedly, and it was even in Chinese: “You stole away Auntie Xiao Xi last night!!!”

Looking at that row of words and seeing that Little Treasure had written a proper sentence, grammar and all, Lu Tingxiao was finally satisfied. Putting down his newspaper, he looked at his son and asked with a significant tone, “You don’t want Auntie Xiao Xi to become my wife?”

“Mine!” Little Treasure wrote on the notepad.

Lu Tingxiao raised his brows, “Unfortunately, the two of you aren’t compatible. You’re younger than her by 19 years. Don’t tell me you want her to wait that long for you to grow up?”

Little Treasure lowered his head and started drawing again, and drew an egg that had gone bad.

Looking at that life-like rotten egg, a trace of a smile appeared on Lu Tingxiao’s face, “I’m speaking the truth, aren’t I?”

When he finished saying so, he paused for a moment before continuing with a bewitching tone, “However, if she becomes my wife, it’ll be different. She’ll become your mother.”

Mother…

Hearing that word, the little bun froze for a moment. He looked down in deep thought, his inner struggle and wavering thoughts clear on his little face…
