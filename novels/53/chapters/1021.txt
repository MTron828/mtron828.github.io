Chapter 1021: They Would Have Weak Points

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The next day, Ning Xi woke up bright and early and changed into casual clothes. She had made an appointment with Gong Shangze to visit the grandmaster of Chinese art, Elder Song Jin, in Taoyuan Village.

Because Taoyuan Village was quite far, it would take about three to four hours of travel time. Plus, the roads in the village were not great, so cars could not enter. That was why Ning Xi decided not to drive and had bought tickets for a long distance coach instead.

Before this, in the studio, Ning Xi and Gong Shangze had already researched in detail on their strategy with Song Jin. It included all of Elder Song’s work and information throughout his life, especially his personality and preferences. Unfortunately, the results of their research were not too optimistic and revealed little.

As the coach gradually left the city, Ning Xi leaned back against the seat and looked at the densely packed information on her notebook with a headache. “Sigh, he’s tough to work with…those who can get to Elder Song’s level are all extraordinary at the least! It’s rather hard to curry favor from him!”

Beside her, Gong Shangze was also using his iPad to browse through Song Jin’s work. He mumbled, “Elder Song is now living alone, so it wouldn’t be useful to enter through those close to him. The worst thing is, Elder Song especially hates people disrupting his peace and quiet. Those who want to use money or other things to brown nose him have minimal chance of succeeding…”

“Huh, he must have a weak point if he’s human! There’s no way that there aren’t any loopholes at all! There’s no use just talking, let’s just discuss when we meet him in person!”

“Mmm, okay!”

On the car, Ning Xi tilted her head and fell asleep. When she woke up, they were about to arrive. Because Ning Xi and Gong Shangze were getting off at the last stop, there were only the two of them left on the bus and the place really looked like a ghost town.

Well, that was no wonder too, or else, the view would not be in such a natural form.

“Wow! The scenery here is so beautiful!” As she looked at the green forest outside her window, Ning Xi instantly regained her spirits and could not help but marvel at the beauty of nature.

Gong Shangze nodded. “Even the air is so refreshing!”

“Ahh! This is pure air with no haze! I must inhale more of it!” Ning Xi closed her eyes and took a few deep breaths.

“Wait till we enter the village. The scenery will be even more amazing!” Gong Shangze said with some yearning.

“Huh, Elder Song really knows how to enjoy life! He should have lots of creative inspiration in such a place, shouldn’t he?”

…

As the two chatted, they reached the last stop. Ning Xi quickly got her bag and descended from the bus with Gong Shangze.

“Where do we go from here?” Ning Xi looked at the borderless paddy fields and forests before them, feeling carefree and relaxed. She thought in her heart that even if she could not get Elder Song to help them, treating this getaway as a vacation was pretty good too.

If there was a chance, she would bring Little Treasure here to play. The last time she had gone camping with Lu Tingxiao and did not bring Little Treasure along, Ning Xi felt guilty. She was ready to make it up to him with another trip.

Gong Shangze looked at the GPS on his phone. “We’ll first follow this little road and walk straight ahead!”

“Okay, let’s go!”

Ning Xi picked a peach blossom from the side of the road and walked ahead, full of vigor. Then, half an hour later, the two of them were stunned.

“Uhh, Gong Shangze…are we lost?”

Gong Shangze clicked on his phone anxiously. “But the GPS says that the path is here!”

“So, the GPS is telling us to swim across?” Ning Xi gaped in disbelief at the wide stream before them.

Gong Shangze sighed, “The terrain here is complex. I think the GPS isn’t accurate. I was too careless reading it!”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

They had no choice but to continue to take a longer route. It was evening by the time they finally found a small courtyard.
