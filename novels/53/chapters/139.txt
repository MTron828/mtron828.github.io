Chapter 140: Hurry Up and Help Me

“Lu Tingxiao! Lu Tingxiao——”

Lu Tingxiao hastily threw aside what he was holding and ran next to the bathroom door, “Ning Xi, what’s wrong?”

“Lu Tingxiao!”

“I’m here.”

“Get in here!”

“…” Go in?

“Hurry up! Hurry, hurry! Ahhhh…”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“You… are you alright?” Lu Tingxiao was getting more and more nervous, but he didn’t dare to simply push the door open and enter.

“My leg is cramping! It’s cramping! Hurry up and help me! Oww…”

“…” Lu Tingxiao facepalmed in both relief and helplessness before quickly pushing open the door and entering.

The water was cold so there wasn’t any vapor inside. After being thoroughly soaked, her clothing had become completely transparent. Lu Tingxiao swallowed slightly. Even though he hadn’t been drugged, his degree of suffering wasn’t any less than Ning Xi’s.

“Lu Tingxiao… Lu Tingxiao?”

Ning Xi’s urging brought him back to reality. Lu Tingxiao quickly walked over, “Which leg is it?”

“The right leg! The right leg!” Ning Xi’s face had turned white from the pain.

Lu Tingxiao simply dispensed with formalities and quickly used one hand to hold her ankle and the other to hold her thigh. Then, he began to massage her with some force.

“Is this okay?”

“No, no! It’s still cramping! Use a little more strength!”

“How about now?”

“Ah! It hurts! Gentler!”

“Is it okay now?”

“Almost there, almost there…”

……

In just a few minutes’ time, Lu Tingxiao’s entire body had become covered in sweat. Exhausted, he gently set down her leg.

A second later, Lu Tingxiao suddenly noticed the many glaring red rope marks on her body and her legs. His expression immediately turned cold. “What happened to your body? Did Zhu Xiangcheng do this?”

“My body?” Ning Xi subconsciously touched her thigh where it was slightly sore, “Are you talking about these? I got them from the suspension wires today.”

Only then did Lu Tingxiao’s expression relax. However, he quickly frowned again, “I’ll go get some medicine for you.”

After saying so, he looked at her worriedly, “Don’t keep soaking. You’ll get sick if you go on like this.”

Ning Xi instinctively sunk deeper into the water and used her fingers to form a ten, “Ten minutes. Just give me ten more minutes. I was almost fully recovered, but when you came in…”

Lu Tingxiao: “…” Fine.

He exited the bathroom and then opened the hotel room door once more.

Sure enough, Lu Jingli came tumbling inside again.

Lu Tingxiao: “…”

Lu Jingli: “…”

Within a second, Lu Jingli crawled to his feet and bowed, “Bro, I’m sorry! I’ll leave immediately!”

“Hold on. Go down and help me buy some medicine.” Lu Tingxiao stopped him.

“What kind of medicine?” Lu Jingli wagged his tail, wearing an ambiguous expression.

“Anything for bruising and such.”

Lu Jingli’s eyes immediately lit up like lamps, “Bro, you finally showed off your prowess?”

Lu Tingxiao’s icy gaze fixed onto him.

Lu Jingli: “I’m sorry, I was wrong. If you finally showed your prowess, how could it have been so short? This lowly one will go run the errand right now!”

Not even five minutes later, Lu Jingli had already come running back after buying the medicine. He spoke with a virtuous expression, “Bro, why don’t you just let me stand guard outside? Wouldn’t it be great if I could go run errands for you at any time?”

Lu Tingxiao cast him a side glance, “If I see you a third time…”

Then the consequences would be very grave…

Lu Jingli could only let out a sigh of regret. Then, he sneakily fished out a little square box from his pocket, “Bro, I bought you this in passing. It’s definitely better than the ones provided by the hotel. Are you sure you don’t want it? Ow——”

Lu Jingli had been thrown out with a kick.
