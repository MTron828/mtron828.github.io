Chapter 119: Born On the Same Day

“Little Ning Xi! Don’t change the topic!” Jiang Muye felt even more sore in his heart as he listened. In his heart, he thought: How can I count as an ex-lover? How can I compare with your childhood sweetheart Yan-gege? You even called out for him in your dreams…

Ning Xi helplessly said, “Fine fine fine, I’m not going to change the topic. Are you trying to expose my relationship with you and Su Yan in front of everyone by making a fuss like this?”

When would this fellow grow up and be a little more mature!

Jiang Muye finally shut up.

“If you want to pay for this dinner, then do as you like!” In the end, Jiang Muye gave a half-hearted reply.

After Su Yan saw Ning Xi whispering into Jiang Muye’s ears, his brows drew together imperceptibly. Did he have the wrong impression? He had a feeling that the relationship between Ning Xi and Jiang Muye went beyond mere colleagues…

Seeing Su Yan staring in Ning Xi’s direction with a lost expression, Ning Xueluo shook his arm to draw his attention before saying tenderly, “Yan-gege, did you bring what I asked you to?”

Su Yan recovered his senses, “I did.”

Having said so, he passed her a stack of invitation cards before saying to everyone, “It’s Xueluo’s birthday tomorrow. I hope that everyone can attend her birthday banquet tomorrow!”

“Ah! It’s Teacher Ning’s birthday tomorrow!”

“We absolutely have to go!”

“Teacher Ning’s birthday banquet must be a high-class affair, we all have to go and see it for ourselves!”

……

Ning Xueluo smiled with a sweet expression as she handed out invitation cards one by one. When it came to Ning Xi’s turn, she didn’t forget to remind her specially, “Junior, you have to come, okay!”

Ning Xi spun her wineglass from time to time, staring at the clear red wine in it without any expression.

When it came to Jiang Muye’s turn, he didn’t even bother moving, “You don’t have to give me one, I’m not going.”

Hearing this, Ning Xueluo’s expression stiffened slightly, but she recovered her sweet smile in the next moment. She asked with concern, “Are you busy tomorrow, Muye? Could you postpone it to another day? I really hope that you’ll be able to come! Please please please!”

She had already promised a few of her close friends who were Jiang Muye’s fans that she would definitely have him at her party.

Most men wouldn’t be able to reject a beautiful woman using that kind of tone to make a request.

However, Jiang Muye was completely immune to it. Contempt flashed across his eyes as he said impatiently, “I can’t postpone it, it’s my friend’s birthday tomorrow too!”

After saying so, he glanced in Ning Xi’s direction.

Ning Xi sipped some wine and remained silent.

“Ah… what a coincidence. Your friend’s birthday is actually on the same day as mine! It must be a very important friend to you, right? Then what a shame! If your friend’s birthday party ends early, then you’re welcome to come to mine at any time. Our party will last overnight!” Ning Xueluo said, acting as if she were kind and considerate.

Damn it, she wasn’t able to get Jiang Muye to come. Wasn’t this going to embarrass her in front of so many of her close friends?

Who was that friend of Jiang Muye’s? That person was not only born on the same day, but was also so important that Jiang Muye would reject her invite in front of so many people!

Wait a minute, born on the same day…UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ning Xueluo cast a glance in Ning Xi’s direction with undecided suspicion.

She had suddenly recalled that Ning Xi was born on the same day as her, and thus her birthday was also tomorrow as well!

The friend that Jiang Muye had mentioned couldn’t be Ning Xi, right?

At this moment, she suddenly remembered something. Wang Taihe had revealed that the last minute investor was Lu Jingli, and her father had told her that the investor had told the director that Ning Xi had to remain as the second female lead. Why would Golden Age Entertainment’s Lu Jingli be so adamant about Ning Xi being the second female lead?

If her guess was right, that Ning Xi and Jiang Muye’s relationship went beyond mere colleagues, then Jiang Muye must have put in a good word for Ning Xi to his bosses at Golden Age.

If things had happened like that, then everything made sense…

This Ning Xi, could she have seduced Jiang Muye?
