er bag and put it on the short table. Then, she took out a single sheet of paper with Lu Tingxiao’s date of birth and said, “Master, it’s all here. I have to trouble you to skim through them!”

Xuan Jing nodded and picked up the birth dates to start going through them.

Yan Ruyi dared not interrupt, so she quietly stood aside and waited.

Xuan Jing looked at every one of them and made notations behind them. A moment later, he finally finished looking through all the birth dates.

When she saw that Xuan Jing’s expression had not changed much from start until the end, Yan Ruyi was a little anxious. She questioned, “Master, among these girls, were there any birth dates that were especially good, or especially compatible with our Tingxiao?”

Master Xuan Jing shook his head confidently and declared, “There are none.”

That meant that all these girls were all ordinary. Even though none of them particularly clashed in terms of compatibility, was there not even one compatible one?

When Yan Ruyi heard this, she could not help but be a little disappointed. She unwillingly looked at the master’s written remarks and realized that not only all of them were ordinary, there was indeed no one who was more outstanding than the rest.

Yan Ruyi kept turning every piece of paper to look at the remarks many times, then finally accepted her son’s fate and put the birth dates away. She absentmindedly nodded, “I’ve troubled you, Master!”

“Donor Yan, not to worry.”

“Then, Master, I won’t disturb you further. I shall make a move now!”

Yan Ruyi was prepared to leave when her footsteps came to a halt. She suddenly thought about how there was still one more person’s date of birth in her bag…

It belonged to that girl named Ning Xi…

She did not know what she was thinking, but before she left, she had actually grabbed the girl’s date of birth too.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Now, should she just casually let the Master have a look at it?
