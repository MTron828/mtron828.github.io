Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Lu Tingxiao’s words dissolved Ning Xi’s worries.

Oh! The devil! He was way too sweet! Too gentle! How she wished she could offer herself to him!

Little Treasure thought his father was really going to give him to Aunty Xiao Xi, then he heard that he was only going to stay here for a period of time, so he was a little unhappy as he felt cheated.

What about giving me away? Liar of a father!

Lu Tingxiao raised his brows and gave his son a signal to mean that he gave him the choice whether he wanted to stay by Aunty Xiao Xi’s side forever.

The little bun chewed on his lower lip and with a motivated expression, he told himself that he could do it! It was useless depending on Father, he would take his fate into his own hands!

Looking at his son getting all fired up, Lu Tingxiao nodded, not feeling guilty at all for using his own son this way!

Excellent, the trump card had been delivered to the wife.

Ning Xi would never have known that she had fallen into the devil’s trap, her mind was filled with happiness at the thought of being able to stay with the little bun.

“It’s late now, I’ll take my leave. Please rest early,” Lu Tingxiao looked at his watch unwillingly as he still had to leave.

Ning Xi’s expression changed.

Lu Tingxiao bent over and told his son, “Little Treasure, I’ll be leaving now, be good to Aunty Xiao Xi!”

Seeing that Lu Tingxiao was going to leave after talking to the little bun, Ning Xi quickly stopped him, “Wait!”

“Anything else?” Lu Tingxiao halted.

“Uh…yes! Well…” Ning Xi scratched her head, and spoke, embarrassed, “Lu Tingxiao, could you…could you stay over tonight?”

Lu Tingxiao was astonished, his eyes were fired up and he looked at the girl passionately.

If Little Treasure had not been there, Ning Xi’s words would have sounded like an ambiguous invitation…

Even though he knew that she did not mean it that way, it sure was enough to fire him up…𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ning Xi realized it was inappropriate for her to say this, so she quickly explained, “Little bun has just only recovered and although the doctor said everything is fine, we cannot eliminate the possibility that he might go into a relapse. I’m worried if something happened…”

When it came to the little bun’s health, she dared not to be careless. Plus, it was her first time taking care of a child alone, so she panicked a little.

Lu Tingxiao understood her worries and when he saw the girl’s dependence on him, the passion in his eyes turned into a gentle warmth, “Okay.”

Ning Xi was relieved, her uneasiness was now gone. “I’ll make the bed for you! No one has stayed in the guest room before and everything is new, so you can stay in immediately! You’ll just need clothes to change into…”

“I’ll have someone to send over.”

“Oh, okay then!”

Father was staying back, ruining his dream of being alone with Aunty Xiao Xi, thought the little bun to himself, feeling heartbroken.

Lu Tingxiao rubbed his son’s head with a light smile, “Don’t forget that we’re an alliance, apart from cooperating together, we’re sharing the profit too.”

No monopoly here!

Little Bun seemed angry but he could not fight back, he then ran into the living room to look for some comfort from Aunty Xiao Xi.

Father was bullying me again!
