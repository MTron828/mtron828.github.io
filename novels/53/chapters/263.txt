Chapter 264: An Ominous Premonition

Translator: – –  Editor: – –

“No, no! Definitely not! Zhizhi, you’ve misunderstood us! We’re not dating!” Ning Xi furiously denied and turned to Jiang Muye for support. That bastard, couldn’t he explain our relationship to Ling Zhizhi?

Jiang Muye did not say anything, and just shot her a nonchalant look.

Ling Zhizhi was Ning Xi’s manager. The decision to tell her or not to tell her would lie in Ning Xi’s hands.

Ning Xi deliberated for a while, then decided that there was no other choice but to tell the truth, “Zhizhi, it’s like this. Senior Jiang and I have known each other since we went to school abroad, and at that point in time…we did date for a while. But it was only for a few days before we broke up, and now we’re purely best friends! I know I should have told you such an important thing much earlier but I thought that you were Jiang Muye’s ex-girlfriend, and so I didn’t want to say anything to make things any more awkward…”

Ling Zhizhi was exclaimed in shock, “Who told you I was his ex-girlfriend?!”

As soon as she finished her sentence, she glared at Jiang Muye.

He defensively said, “Why are you looking at me? I said no such thing – she made those assumptions herself.”

Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him, “Only because you were behaving so oddly! Can you blame me for overthinking?”

It looked like the two of them were about to launch into an argument, when Ling Zhizhi massaged her temples and sighed, “Ning Xi, Jiang Muye and I are purely just former manager and artiste, you need not worry.”

Immediately,a cold expression flashed across Jiang Muye’s features.

“Mmm, I know that now!” Since Ling Zhizhi said it herself, Ning Xi naturally believed her.

“Well then, let’s discuss a solution to this issue now.” Having cleared up the misunderstanding, Ling Zhizhi began to address the serious problem at hand, “Previously, Jiang Muye’s fans didn’t quite like you, and that was due to some malicious intentions. Now, that their attitudes have changed 180 degrees, there are now a lot of fans that ship the both of you.

Therefore, Ming and I have discussed that when the both of you respond to the reporters and the public about this, you can be ambiguous with your responses without denying completely. Just explain that the both of you work in the same company, have complementing personalities, admire one another, and are currently very good friends. Leave them some ambiguity for their imaginations to run wild.”

Ning Xi nodded obediently, saying, “Oh, okay, I’ll do whatever you say!”

Jiang Muye, with a hand supporting his chin, lazily replied, “No comments! Now can I go back to sleep?”

Ning Xi immediately slapped him and said, “Sleep, your head! Quickly wake up! We’re starting work soon!”

Jiang Muye frustratedly scratched his head and asked, “Which scene are we filming this afternoon?”

Ning Xi stared at him unhappily and replied, “The kissing scene! Don’t you dare tell me that you haven’t even looked at the script once since it was changed! If I was Ming, I would have punched you 800 times a day!”

Since Ling Zhizhi now knew about their relationship anyway, Ning Xi could finally stop pretending to be polite to Jiang Muye.

Jiang Muye heard this and scoffed, “Pft, the higher ups are planning to make it a summer release, there will be many underaged audiences so the scriptwriter has already removed all the kissing and erotic scenes, what kiss scenes are you talking about?”

“Most of it has been removed, but wasn’t there still a little left? One scene of our first kiss, one sex scene within the military camp. The kiss scene is the one we did right before the hailstorm started and we had to stop. The director said that shots from the front could be used, we just need to supplement it with one more shot of a quick kiss!”

“Oh, okay…” Jiang Muye muttered.

For some reason, the tip of his eyebrows started pulsating, in a way that signified an ominous premonition.
