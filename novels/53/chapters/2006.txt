Xu Tao’s heart skipped a beat. “This matter… is really odd. The two of them weren’t really close with each other when they were in Glory World, but after they went to Starlight, Han Zixuan not only suppressed the artistes from Starlight, but she also made sure to keep an eye on artistes who transferred to Starlight from Glory World. She would never allow anyone to surpass her position!

“Someone of Yin Youyou’s level was a big threat to her. Common sense dictates that their relationship should be like cat and dog.

“However, on the surface, Han ZIxuan is very friendly with Yin Youyou. Han Zixuan even brought Yin Youyou to important events together.”

Liang Feixing started to catch on. “That doesn’t make sense. I remember there was once when Yin Youyou snatched a role from Han Zixuan, but Han Zixuan did not say anything about it. She even told the media that she recommended the role to Yin Youyou, but everyone in the industry knew that Han Zixuan had been aiming for that role…”

At this point, Xu Tao jumped up. “Is it possible that Yin Youyou has secret information on Han Zixuan?”

“Very likely!” Liang Feixing nodded.

Xu Tao was impressed by Ning Xi. “My queen, you’re the best. I never thought of it!”

Ning Xi laughed. “I’m just watching it from a third person’s point of view, so it’s all just guesswork. I’ll still need Bro Tao to do the work.”

Xu Tao then replied, “Don’t worry, leave it to me!”

Ling Feixing sighed, “I’ve adapted a narrow vision and keep thinking about checking Han Zixuan and neglected the others. I think Ning Xi’s guess is correct. Most likely, that’s the case, and the information Yin Youyou has is definitely important. It’s enough to destroy Han Zixuan’s career in the entertainment industry. However, Yin Youyou would never give something like that to us!”

Xu Tao raised his eyebrows and said confidently, “Don’t worry about it. It’s a small issue!”

Liang Feixing raised his eyebrows as well. “Alright then, I forgot we have an expert swindler on our side!”

Ning Xi smiled. “Then, we’ll wait for your good news, Bro Tao.”

…

Late at night, in a room in a restaurant.

Yin Youyou threw her purse on the table and crossed her arms. She glared at the man opposite her impatiently. “Talk! What do you want?”

Xu Tao was being polite but his eyes seemed nervous. “I’m sorry to bother you so late at night!”

Yin Youyou scoffed, “Forget it if it’s about Ning Xi! She’s going to die!”

Yin Youyou was really angry as she remembered the humiliation she suffered backstage at the TV station the other day. She would never give up the chance to mock Ning Xi, which was also the reason why she accepted Xu Tao’s invitation.

She would love to see Xu Tao being in a dire state.

“Sigh, you deserve my sympathy, Bro Tao. You just held onto someone so dependent, yet so soon she’s turning into mud, haha…”

Xu Tao’s expression looked desperate. After a while, he then said, “Youyou, it doesn’t matter what’s happening to me. The one who’s losing the most now is you…”

Yin Youyou looked disgruntled. “What nonsense are you talking about? What do I have to lose?”

Xu Tao looked at her in surprise. “Don’t you know?”
