Chapter 166: A Faster Way

That really was a perfect way to settle things!

However, the thought of carrying out extortion herself didn’t sit too well with her conscience…

Ning Xi bit her lip as she recalled everything that had occurred that night. Shortly afterwards, she sneered inwardly. Ah, what was there to feel bad about? They had already reached this point!

Ning Xi quickly made up her mind, “Okay, send the evidence to me and I’ll go contact Ning Xueluo!”

“There’s no need to do it yourself. I’ll do it for you so that no one will be able to trace your IP address.” Lu Tingxiao responded.

At this point, Ning Xi had started looking at Lu Tingxiao like he was a god. She spoke with starry eyes, “Great God Lu, this skill of yours is really too OP! Are you accepting any students?”

Lu Tingxiao’s mood improved quite a bit upon seeing the worship in the girl’s expression. He glanced at her, “Nope.”

Ning Xi’s face was immediately filled with disappointment, “Oh…”

Of course he wasn’t accepting any disciples! Big Boss Lu had so much to do on his plate everyday. How could he possibly accept any students…

Lu Tingxiao stared at her with hidden meaning, “If you want to acquire this skill, there’s actually a faster way.”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“What? What?” Ning Xi asked with renewed energy.

Lu Tingxiao: “Marry me.”

If she married him, then everything that was his would become hers. She wouldn’t need to learn anything then.

Ning Xi broke out into a coughing fit and almost choked on her own spit.

She couldn’t actually find any faults with this method of his…

But… was she getting flirted with again?

Lu Tingxiao enjoyed the girl’s embarrassed expression for a moment before he asked, “Have you thought about which company you’ll join after terminating your contract?”

Ning Xi rubbed her chin, “Well… I’m still thinking about that…”

Speaking in an extremely casual tone, Lu Tingxiao said, “After you prove your innocence this time around, your popularity will be on par with second and top tier actors. When the time comes, it’ll be easy to find your next company.”

Ning Xi sighed, “Actually, it’s quite troublesome. There won’t be much competition if I want to enter a small company, but the future prospects are slim. Meanwhile, it’s hard to get into a large company without some sort of background. It seems like I’m getting a lot of exposure right now, but all of it is built on top of scandals. I don’t even have a single completed project so I’m in a pretty awkward position… Oh, Teacher Lu, do you have any suggestions?”

Ning Xi had already subconsciously started looking to Lu Tingxiao for his opinion when it came to making important decisions.

Lu Tingxiao poured her a glass of water and replied, “From my perspective as a businessman, you’re an investment with a lot of potential. I’m interested in seeing the value you’ll create in the future. Therefore, I hope that you can join Golden Age.”

When she heard his words, Ning Xi’s eyes opened wide and it took her a long while to recover, “Eh, Big Boss, are you personally poaching me right now?”

Lu Tingxiao chuckled, “You could put it that way. I really do want to poach you. Will you come?”

Damn! Shouldn’t that tone he was using be considered a foul?!

Ning Xi gulped and calmed herself down. She then spoke with a serious expression, “To tell you the truth, if all goes well and I can leave Starlight smoothly, Golden Age is the company that I would like to enter the most. Golden Age has already surpassed Starlight to become the industry’s top entertainment company, and its future prospects are undoubtedly the best…”

Lu Tingxiao nodded with satisfaction and extended his hand, “Well then, let’s have a successful partnership.”

“Ah?” Ning Xi subconsciously extended her hand, “Let’s… Let’s have a successful partnership.”

What… What just happened? They started working together just like that?

She had already reached an agreement with Golden Age just like that?

The great demon king was also pretty efficient at poaching people…

TL Note:

OP = overpowered (gaming term)

I used it to show how casual Ning Xi’s tone is~
