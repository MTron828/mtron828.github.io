Chapter 122: I’ll Support You For A Lifetime

“Eh, CEO… CEO Lu…” Zhu Xiangcheng had just been hounding Ning Xi persistently, but now, his expression immediately turned stiff. However, he quickly adopted a flattering attitude, “Has CEO Lu also taken a fancy to this girl? Well, since it’s like that, please go right ahead!”Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Everyone in the room who had been watching the scene unfold was shocked. What sort of situation was this?

Every time Lu Tingxiao came out to social gatherings, he was like a cold and detached lone wolf, and he was completely resistant to feminine charms. However, today, he was actually interested in a woman who had drunkenly barged into the wrong room?

Lu Tingxiao ignored their reactions. At the moment, he was only focused on one person.

He furrowed his brows as he looked at the girl who was swaying in his embrace, “What happened?”

“Lu…” Ning Xi caught herself right before she accidentally addressed him directly by name. She stammered in reply, “I walked into the wrong room…”

The lighting in the room was rather dim. She hadn’t noticed that Lu Tingxiao was also here.

Amid a sea of beer bellies, Lu Tingxiao’s presence was like a breath of fresh air.

“Which room are you guys in? I’ll bring you there.” Lu Tingxiao didn’t even bother glancing at the mixed expressions from the people behind him. Instead, he directly escorted Ning Xi out.

Just now, he had been resting with his eyes closed. He had vaguely heard the room roar with laughter, but he hadn’t paid much attention. It wasn’t until he heard Ning Xi’s familiar voice that he opened his eyes to see that Zhu Xiangcheng was actually pulling her and getting physical with her as well.

In that instant, he suddenly felt the urge to snap off the man’s hand.

However, he didn’t want to scare her, so he suppressed his malicious, dark thoughts and approached her, pretending to be a stranger to help her get out of her quandary.

After exiting the room, Ning Xi was finally able to relax. “Lu Tingxiao, thank you. If it weren’t for you, I probably would have gotten into trouble tonight!” If words had not worked with that person, she would have been forced to resort to physical violence.

“What’s wrong with getting into trouble? I’m here to help you clean up any trouble. If you encounter a situation like this in the future, you’re not allowed to let yourself be taken advantage of again!” Lu Tingxiao lectured her with a grave expression.

Ning Xi laughed and sighed, “Ay, it really feels great to have someone back me up!”

When Little Treasure no longer needed her and the time came for her to leave the Lu home, would she and Lu Tingxiao become strangers?

For some reason, that thought made her feel a trace of sadness…

Lu Tingxiao ruffled the girl’s hair. I could support you for a lifetime if you would let me.

Ning Xi waved away the forbidden thoughts running in her head. “I’m fine now. I can go back on my own!”

“Are you sure you’ll be fine on your own?” Lu Tingxiao didn’t look reassured at all.

“I’m fine, I’m fine. You should hurry and go back in!” Ning Xi waved her hand as she walked backwards.

Lu Tingxiao had known ahead of time that her crew would be here for dinner, which was why he had accepted the invitation from those people earlier to this boring party.

Of course, he also knew which room Ning Xi was in.

Therefore, when he saw Ning Xi walking away in the wrong direction, Lu Tingxiao sighed helplessly. He caught up to her within a few strides, “Forget it, I’ll send you back! What’s your room number?”

“Oh, it’s 801!”

“801 isn’t in this direction.” Lu Tingxiao held her up and guided her in the right direction.

Lu Tingxiao didn’t stop until he had delivered her to the door. “Go in and don’t run all over the place again. If you have to go to the restroom, bring a friend with you. If you can’t find someone, asking Jiang Muye is fine too.”

Pfft, asking Jiang Muye to accompany her to the restroom?

“I got it! Thanks for personally bringing me back, Big Boss Lu!” Ning Xi reached out her hands and made a heart sign.

Lu Tingxiao smiled as the remaining dark thoughts in his mind were completely erased, “Send me a text when you leave later. Let’s go back together.”
