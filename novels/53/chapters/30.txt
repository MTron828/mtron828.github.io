Chapter 31: What Kind of Eyesight Do You Have!

After saying this, Guo Qisheng had a ‘wait and see’ expression on his face.

As expected, when all the reporters turned towards the direction that Guo Qisheng was pointing at, their first reaction was to be stunned silly.

Ning Xi was wearing a magenta dress made out of lace. The cutting of the fabric flattered her mesmerising waistline while the collar revealed her beautiful collarbone. This colour was even harder to pull off than pure red and it was even made of lace. Although it had a great design, most people would only look terrible or tacky when wearing it.

However, it was as if that dress was made for Ning Xi. It enhanced her looks and made her even more charming and lovely, thereby causing her beauty to stand out.

When the stylist had picked this dress out for her, Ning Xi herself had also thought that she wouldn’t be able to pull it off. However, she had been proven wrong after putting it on.

As expected of the Godly Hand of Golden Age Entertainment, he had great eyes. He knew her better than she knew herself after just one meeting.

Although it was Ning Xi’s first time walking the red carpet, she was an actress after all. She had already tried on many various roles with different occupations, which naturally included celebrities, and had even acted as one once or twice. Walking down the red carpet was easy.

Every step, every smile and every action caught just the right angles for the cameras. She could even show the most perfect expressions.

The reporters remained dazed for even longer than Director Guo had, and only regained their senses after a long while.

This… this was Ning Xi, the actress who was going to play Meng Changge?

An unknown rookie without any known work?

This…. wasn’t she too beautiful?

There were no other words to describe it, she was just… beautiful!

Now they realised why Director Guo’s expression didn’t look right when they were so persistent with their questions just now. It was ridiculous to ask whether Jia Qingqing or Ning Xi was more beautiful.

In front of an absolute beauty like Ning Xi, even a ‘beautiful’ starlet like Jia Qingqing would become just a simple face in the crowd.

It wasn’t just her looks, but also the way she held herself that made her stand out from the other rookies. Her gestures were both elegant and open, even exuding an innate nobility.

Ning Xi walked to the center of the red carpet and casually posed a few times to let the media take pictures. Following that, she turned around and picked up the pen from the tray to sign her name on the wall.

This one turn of her body caused a wave of excitement and shutter clicks.

The dress had been designed to reveal the back, and that was one of the reasons the stylist had chosen this dress in the end.

Ning Xi’s shoulder blades were simply too beautiful. They were the most entrancing part of her whole body, and it would be too much of a shame if they weren’t shown off.

Most female stars liked to reveal cleavage to draw attention when walking the red carpet, but Ning Xi had taken another route, elevating her above the rest.

After murdering countless rolls of film, it was finally time to interview her.

The reporters were actually quite pitiful today.

They had all prepared questions like ‘Do you think you’ll be able to play a vixen like Meng Changge well with looks like that?’, ‘Who do you think is prettier, you or Jia Qingqing?’, ‘We’ve heard that you were specially picked outside of official channels, was there a reason for that?’…

Now they weren’t able to use any of those questions at all…

As long as they weren’t blind, they would know that nothing had happened behind the scenes, her face was just too convincing.

She was just the most suitable person to play Meng Changge.

Thus the reporters had to spin up questions on the spot.

“Miss Ning, may I ask if the dress you’re wearing is a customised piece from Karl Lagerfeld?”

Ning Xi was stunned.

What the heck, this was a custom gown from Karl Lagerfeld?

She had casually put on a dress worth thousands of dollars?

Evil King Lu, what were you thinking!!

However, an even more terrifying question was lying in wait for her. Following that question, the same reporter named the origins of each item she was wearing and then asked, “Miss Ning, is Arthur your stylist?”Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

You could even tell something just like that?

What kind of eyesight do you have!!!
