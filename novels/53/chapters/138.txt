Chapter 139: Emptiness is Form, Form is Emptiness

“What is it?” Lu Tingxiao subconsciously braced himself.

“That strip of cloth that was covering my eyes… Could you help me put it on again?” Ning Xi asked in a low voice.

Astonishment flashed briefly across Lu Tingxiao’s face, “Why?”

Ning Xi helplessly said, “Out of sight, out of mind.”

Even though Ning Xi’s words were very cryptic, Lu Tingxiao immediately understood and coughed lightly before picking up the lace fabric strip that had been thrown to the ground. He then gently covered her eyes with it and tied it around her head again.

The instant that Lu Tingxiao came closer, the fire inside Ning Xi unexpectedly flared up. She hurriedly chanted in her mind: “Emptiness is form, form is emptiness.” It was only when he had backed away to a safe distance and her sight had been covered that the uproar inside her body slowly calmed down.

If it had been someone as disgusting and vulgar as Zhu Xiangcheng who had come, then it would have been fine. However, it just had to be Lu Tingxiao. She had been drugged with an aphrodisiac, and Lu Tingxiao was basically a catalyst who could increase the effect of the medicine infinitely, creating a reaction that could take a person’s life away.

“Is it okay now?” Lu Tingxiao asked.

Ning Xi nodded, “There’s one more thing I need to ask of you. I have no strength left in my body at all, could you help me get to the bathroom? I’ll be fine after I soak in a cold water bath.”

“Wait for a bit, I’ll help you fill up the tub.”

“Thank you.”

The distinct sound of the water splashing in the bathroom rang distinctly in the quiet room.

Although she was as blind as before, this time, she felt a sense of ease and relief.

After some time, the sound of the water stopped and footsteps could be heard.

“Can you walk?” Lu Tingxiao asked.

“I think I can, just support me for a second.”

Lu Tingxiao reached out his arms to support her and even thoughtfully maintained a distance between them, only his arms were in contact with her.

When her body was finally submerged in the icy water, Ning Xi gave a comfortable sigh, “Mmm…”

Lu Tingxiao’s expression tensed up, “I’m leaving first. If you need anything, just call me. Don’t soak for too long and be careful not to catch a cold.”

“Okay.”

Lu Tingxiao turned and left. The back of his figure conveyed his urgency and a sense of escaping from a difficult situation.

After leaving, Lu Tingxiao pulled open the room door, only to see a person crashing into the room because his support was gone.

Lu Jingli climbed up and dusted off his rear while trying to peek into the room. He coughed once before saying “Heh heh… I was only worried for you guys… only worried… I definitely wasn’t being a busybody…”

Lu Tingxiao looked as if he had already been expecting him to be hiding by the door. With a cold tone, he spoke up, “Go to the car and bring me the documents.”

Lu Jingli gaped until his mouth formed an O shape, “Brother, are you sure? You can still look at documents in this kind of situation? Are you still a man!”

Lu Tingxiao’s eyes coldly swept over him, “Do I need to prove it to you?”

“No no no, no need! I’m going now! Immediately!” His brother would definitely prove it to him via a specially manly and violent beating.

After he brought the documents over, Lu Jingli heard the sound of the water from inside. He then sighed and bitterly said, “Why soak in a cold water bath! Why don’t you just offer yourself up as the antidote! What a waste! This is such a waste!”

Lu Tingxiao : “You can leave now.”

“Actually, I don’t want to leave. Actually, I want to stay~ Stay and accompany you every season~~~” Lu Jingli sang while reluctantly disappearing.

After returning to the room, Lu Tingxiao tried hard to ignore the faint silhouette behind the frosted bathroom door and forced himself to concentrate on the document in his hands.

Hm, he was pretty efficient… In 30 minutes, he actually managed to finish reading two pages…

It was at this moment that Ning Xi anxiously shouted from the bathroom, “Lu Tingxiao——”
