Chapter 69: So Handsome My Legs Are WobblyL𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The cast and crew were the same as usual, there weren’t any changes due to the second male lead’s pending arrival.

A group of young ladies were surrounding the male lead, Zhao Sizhou. Their faces were full of admiration as they listened to him recount his moments of glory in the entertainment circle. Jia Qingqing and Ning Xueluo had become even closer and closer, and were currently discussing the diamond bracelet her father had just bought for her in high spirits.

Only Ning Xi was looking here and there, since she had too many scenes with the second male lead. The second male lead’s skills would have a huge effect on her work.

Jia Qingqing showed off the sparkling diamond bracelet on her wrist, her expression clearly looking down on Ning Xi, “Xueluo-jie, look at how she’s so eagerly waiting for that man to come. She really believed the director’s words, does she think that a good actor will come just because she’s waiting like that?”

Ning Xueluo had a helpless expression upon hearing this, she said in a displeased tone, “Oh you, don’t keep criticising Ning Xi. She has the most scenes with the second male lead, it’s natural that she’ll be more concerned about him!”

“Heh heh, there really are quite a few of them, and there are so many kissing and bed scenes! Luckily, I didn’t take that role at the start, otherwise I’d be getting taken advantage of!” Jia Qingqing was rejoicing. After she finished saying so, she looked enviously at Ning Xueluo, “Xueluo-jie still has it the best. Your boyfriend’s so handsome, and your partner’s also so handsome…”

……

At this moment, the director Guo Qisheng’s excited voice sounded from the entrance of the set–

“Come come come, everyone come over! Our second male lead, the actor for the godly doctor Sun Huanqing is here! Everyone come and greet him!”

The cast and crew returned scattered replies, and Zhao Sizhou had absolutely no intention of getting up. The young ladies were also still surrounding him, fighting to let him read their palms.

Jia Qingqing gave a ‘tsk’ full of disdain, and didn’t even bother looking over. Ning Xueluo touched up her makeup before getting up and persuading her, “We should still go over and greet him, we’re all colleagues here.”

It was only then that Jia Qingqing reluctantly followed her out of the break room.

Ning Xi had naturally sprinted over at the first moment, and was reaching her head out to look. In the next second, her whole body froze as if she had been struck by divine lightning.

The guy next to the director was…

That eye-catching blond hair; even if she tried to deceive herself into thinking that she had seen wrongly, it was impossible…

Why would the second male lead be that fellow…

This… couldn’t… be… real…

From the direction of the entrance, the errand boy Xiao Li suddenly screamed out loud as if he was getting killed, “AHHHHHHHHH….”

Jia Qingqing frowned deeply, “Are you crazy! What are you screaming for?”

Having said so, she glanced over and spotted the man following behind the director…

“Ah….” She also screamed once in shock.

“What happened?” Ning Xueluo asked.

“Jiang… Jiang Muye! Xueluo-jie! It’s Jiang Muye!” Jia Qingqing clutched Ning Xueluo’s arm excitedly.

“What?” Ning Xueluo followed her line of sight.

She saw that the director was currently happily walking in front, his attitude polite and caring, while a blond man was following him from behind. He was wearing a set of extremely trendy high contrast t-shirt and shorts, one hand stuck in his pocket, his face carried his unique flair of arrogance. He looked like a complete bad boy. When he smiled and looked over, he even revealed some extremely adorable canines…

Jiang Muye… The second male lead was actually Jiang Muye…

Even Ning Xueluo had been shocked by this result.

The young ladies who had been surrounding Zhao Sizhou had already rushed towards the entrance like a pack of hungry wolves by now:

“Oh oh oh! Jiang Muye! Is it really Jiang Muye? Am I turning blind? Quick, pinch me!”

“Heavens! He’s really a walking aphrodisiac! He’s too handsome! He’s so handsome my legs are going wobbly! I even heard that Jiang Muye has granny fans! He’s even captured the heart of an eighty year old granny!”

“Don’t block me, it’s so rare to see him in person. I’m going to bed him! If I don’t bed Jiang Muye at least once in my life, how am I any different from a salted fish!”
