Chapter 79: Cute, Adorable Bunny Ears

After work, Jia Qingqing finally found an opportunity to fawn upon Jiang Muye. What made it even more perfect was that Ning Xi wasn’t around. Thus, she moved close to Jiang Muye with a shy expression, “Muye-ge, where should we go to eat? Would you like to go to Hundred Rivers Hotel for seafood? My father’s a member there, we can use the VIP room there!”

Jiang Muye stretched lazily with waning enthusiasm, “Forget it, I’m not going. I’m too tired today!”

Jia Qingqing was anxious upon hearing so, “Ah? But today’s your first day on set, you should have this welcome feast no matter what!”

Jiang Muye’s expression sank when he heard this, “Who made the rule that there has to be a welcome feast on the first day? If you want it so badly, go eat it yourself!”

Actually, everyone knew that Jiang Muye’s temper wasn’t too good.

He would be easy to get along with when he was in a good mood. If he wasn’t in a good mood, then…Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

And right now, this guy was obviously in a bad mood.

Having been scolded, Jia Qingqing’s eyes immediately turned red, “I just thought that this was proper etiquette. Muye-gege, why did you have to say it like that…”

Damn it, who’s your Muye-gege?

With the frustration in his heart, Jiang Muye was about to explode. To the side, Guo Qisheng saw that the situation didn’t look good, so he tried to smooth over the situation and said, “Let’s postpone it to some other day then. Muye seems to be very tired today. We should have let him rest and get used to the environment on the first day since we didn’t think that we would immediately shoot a few scenes. Everyone, let’s go back early and rest today. We have plenty of chances for a welcome feast later on!”

“Alright then…” After she was able to get out of the sticky situation, Jia Qingqing unwillingly nodded. At the same time, her hatred towards Ning Xi surged. It was all because of Ning Xi hogging Muye-gege for the entire day, that he was tired to the point that he didn’t even want to eat dinner!

Jia Qingqing lowered her head and secretly flipped through the few photos in her phone, and a malevolent smile rose on her lips.

Ning Xi, just you wait, I’m going to make you pay the price!

……

In the Lu residence.

“Darling, I’m back!” Once she got home, Ning Xi’s fatigue was completely washed away.

Little Treasure trotted over to welcome her upon hearing her voice, even holding a glass of ice cold fruit juice in his hands.

“Darling, you’re too sweet! Love you!” Ning Xi took it over and gulped it all down in one shot, before happily saying, “Come here, come here, Auntie’s going to take you to change into some cute clothes. We’re going out to eat hotpot in a while!”

The little bun who had always run back to his room upon hearing ‘going out’, obediently allowed Ning Xi to lead him upstairs.

When they reached the bedroom, he allowed her to try set after set of clothes on him.

“This one’s too plain, this one’s too dark, this one’s too boring… My goodness! Who bought these clothes for you? What kind of aesthetic sense is this! I don’t even need to ask, it must be your dad! Has he forgotten that you’re only 5 years old, not 35?”

Ning Xi complained as she rummaged through the closet, before finally picking up a piece that she was most satisfied with, “Wow! This one’s so cute!”

It was a white short-sleeved shirt with a hoodie that had two long bunny ears and a pair of overalls to match. The overalls even had a large pocket on the front like Doraemon.

“Looking at this style, your second uncle must have bought this for you! He’s pretty dependable on this front. Little kids should wear cute clothes and look a little more lively!” Ning Xi nodded in self-satisfaction before asking, “Darling, what do you think? Do you like this one? If you don’t like it, Auntie will find another one for you!”

Ning Xi didn’t forget to seek Little Treasure’s opinion, though Little Treasure would always agree with her opinion every time.

As expected, the little bun nodded without hesitation this time.

Thus, Ning Xi happily helped the little bun put on the outfit.
