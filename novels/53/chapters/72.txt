Chapter 73: Keep Going, Don’t Stop

All the young women on set started going wild again after watching this scene.

“AHHHH! Muye in bondage play! Even in my dreams, I think about tying up Muye and throwing him on the bed!”

“What are you getting so excited for? You’re not the one going up there!”

“Dammit, dammit. Why does it have to be that annoying vixen!”

“Seriously, she’s so annoying. Can’t Muye ask the director to switch her out? She’s not good enough for him at all!

“Ahem…” Guo Qisheng coughed to signal for everyone to settle down. Then he clapped his hands and shouted, “Okay, everyone get ready. Three. Two. One. Action!”

Ning Xi wasn’t affected in the least by the surrounding chatter. When the sound of the director’s voice died down, her expression immediately changed.

Her eyes became that of a 16-year-old young woman – pure and clear, and as lively as the sun. Her face was perfectly adorned with a lazy, devil-may-care expression.

She raised the hem of her skirt, lifted up a foot, and kicked open her room door.

Next, the camera switched over to Jiang Muye.

A young man laid on the crimson colored bedsheets with his hands and feet bound up. That color made his complexion look even more pale and fragile, giving any observers the urge to ravage him.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Upon hearing the kick on the door, Sun Huanqing slowly opened his eyes. He watched in a daze as a young woman approached the bed with light shining from behind her.

Meng Changge sat her butt next to the bed. From her bosom, she fished out a packet made of oiled paper. “I had to wait an hour in line to buy these fried chestnuts from Fuxing Store. You gonna eat some?”

Sun Huanqing turned his head away and closed his eyes, completely ignoring her.

Meng Changge peeled one and tossed it into her mouth. She grinned craftily. “Not going to eat? Then I’m going to feed you! In a way that might embarrass you…”

“You…” Sun Huanqing immediately opened his eyes. The expression in his eyes was three parts anger and seven parts humiliation. “You’re a girl. How could you be this immodest!”

Meng Changge cast a sideways glance at him and raised her eyebrows. “Modesty? What’s the use of feeling shame? Can that kill an enemy or attract a wife?”

Sun Huanqing exploded in anger. “The Meng family is loyal and righteous. Each of your forefathers fought on the battlefield for the country, but you… you spend your days playing hooky and bullying others. How will you face the ancestors of your family?”

Meng Changge had heard those same words from the people around her so often that her ears had practically fallen off. Using her fingers to plug her ears, she spoke loudly while holding a chestnut in her mouth, “You’re still unmarried even at this age. There are three ways to be unfilial, but the worst is not having any descendants. How will you face the ancestors of your family?”

Suan Huanqing almost died of frustration from her twisted logic. He spoke haughtily, “Those are two different matters. Besides, my interests lie elsewhere!”

Meng Changge stomped her foot by the bedside. Using the whip in her hands, she lashed Sun Huanqing over and over again. Finally, she lifted his chin in a manner that was neither harsh nor gentle. Her expression was like a cunning and naughty little fox. “Doctor Sun, what do you think of this suggestion? I’ll be your wife. Once I become your wife, I’ll do whatever you tell me to. If you want me to walk East, I won’t walk West. If you want me to be good, I’ll listen to you obediently. Won’t we both be able to face our ancestors this way?”

Sun Huanqing was stunned. A trace of urgency flashed across his face, “You… Don’t speak nonsense!”

As if she had discovered a whole new world, Meng Changge scooted forward until she was almost touching his face. “Eh? Doctor Sun, you’re blushing! You actually like me, don’t you? Why don’t we skip to our wedding night and seal the deal?”

“Cut——”

Everyone had been full of anticipation when the director yelled cut. Why stop? Why not continue acting it out ahhhhh! They wanted to continue watching! They wanted to watch them seal the deal!
