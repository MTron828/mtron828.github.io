“Yes!” The young man replied in a determined tone. His expression did not look like he was joking.

“Why do you suddenly have this thought? How can I believe that you’re not just acting at the spur of the moment or…is this just a bad joke?” Zhuang Liaoyuan’s expression looked serious.

The young man clenched his teeth. “Father, I’m serious about it. As for why, you know that I’ve never really had any huge ambitions. I just don’t want people around me to worry about me. I also hope that I can protect the people I love if anything happens. I want to be someone you can rely on, and not just someone to be protected.”

Zhuang Liaoyuan was truly surprised by his son’s words.

If Zhuang Rongguang said something like “I want to protect my country and make my family proud”, he would never believe it.

But yet he had uttered these.

As Zhuang Liaoyuan was thinking it through, Zhuang Rongguang took out a scary long whip and gave it to his father. “Father, I actually wanted to follow sister’s advice and hide it from you, but I can’t just let it be.”

The young man’s body trembled as he remembered what happened last night. “Last night, I tried to get money on my own to leave the house, so I listened to Sun Bin and Liang Haoqiang. I went to the casino and was cheated. I lost five million dollars.”

“What did you say!?” Zhuang Liaoyuan smacked the table furiously as his expression changed.

Zhuang Rongguang put the whip on the table and continued, “They aren’t local and there were a lot of them. I was actually expecting Sun Bin and Liang Haoqiang to come back with the money to save me but in the end, they abandoned me…”

“Expecting the two of them to save you…” Zhuang Liaoyuan’s expression darkened. “How can my son be so stupid?”

“I did something even more stupid afterwards.” Zhuang Rongguang’s voice went hoarse. “I dared not call home. Without any more ideas, I called Sis…”

“You bastard!” Zhuang Liaoyuan threw his teacup away as uneasy thoughts suddenly floated in his mind. He freaked out. “What happened to your sister last night?! Tell me!”

If something had not happened to Keer, there was no way he would change so drastically all of a sudden!

With his experience, he could easily imagine what had happened last night. The moment he thought about what Keer might have gone through, his mind went haywire…

“Sis brought the money over but they did not fulfill their promise. They wanted her…to stay with them for the night…”

In the next moment, Zhuang Liaoyuan whipped the young man harshly. Zhuang Rongguang fell to the floor.

The door was opened from outside. Zhuang Keer rushed in and stopped her father from hitting Zhuang Rongguang. “Rongguang! Didn’t I tell you not to tell Father!? What happened to you!?”

Zhuang Rongguang’s face went pale from the pain. “Sis…I don’t want to hide behind you anymore…I’ll be responsible…I deserve it…”
