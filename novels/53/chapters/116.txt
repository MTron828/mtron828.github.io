Chapter 117: Are You Defying Nature Now!?

“Ah! It’s raining——” Cries of alarm sounded from the crowd.

Since the coloured lanterns were made of paper and glue, and most of the lotus lanterns were in the open, they were instantly put out by the rain.

Ning Xi, who had just been about to initiate the kiss, suddenly stopped all movement because of this sudden change. She subconsciously raised a hand to cover her head, “Why did it suddenly start raining? Hey, ouch! Why does it seems like there’s hail!”

Jiang Muye had been so nervous that his heart had almost stopped; when they were forced to cut the scene, he was this close to fainting after choking on his breath, “Damn it! Hasn’t there been a drought recently? It hasn’t rained in a few months! It’s such a hot day, how could it hail!”

In the car, Lu Jingli had a stupefied expression.

It was raining? The weather was just fine a moment ago, how could it rain? Uh, wait… Listening to the thumps coming from the car roof, it seemed like there was even hail…

At this moment, the cogs in Lu Jingli’s head spun into place before he turned to his completely unsurprised and stony-faced brother, his mouth twitching. Lu Jingli was speechless, “You even made it rain… Bro, are you trying to defy nature! Also, don’t you think you’ve overdone it? For goodness’ sake, it’s hailing!”

Seeing that filming had stopped, the pressure around Lu Tingxiao retreated like the tide. A single word came from his thin lips: “Drive.”

“Yes, Eldest Young Master.” The driver started the engine, and in the dark of the night, the car silently left the scene.

Guo Qisheng had not expected that such a situation would occur. He wrung his hands repeatedly. If they had been able to continue filming just now, it would have been a perfect scene.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Ah, forget about it, forget about it… the road to happiness is filled with setbacks! Let’s wrap up for the day! However, don’t leave yet, everyone. Let us all have dinner together tonight! We weren’t able to give Muye a welcome dinner the last time, so we shall make up for it today!” Guo Qisheng called out to the crowd.

There had been a lot of drama going on in the crew recently, gathering for a dinner would help them settle the ruffled feelings they had.

The crew, who had still been listless over the sudden change in the weather, instantly recovered their spirits. All of them shouted in joy.

Jiang Muye gave a lifeless shout in reply, clearly in a bad mood.

Ning Xi threw a towel to him, “What kind of expression is that? Are you disappointed that you didn’t get forcefully kissed by me?”

“Nonsense! I’m just not happy that I have to do that scene again with you!” Jiang Muye stared at her, then with an expression of warning, “You shouldn’t have any problems tonight, right?”

“Not at all! What problems could I have!” While saying so, Ning Xi sent a message to Lu Tingxiao to inform him as usual.

Jiang Muye stared at her phone secretly, looking at what she was sending, then realising that something was wrong, “Little Ning Xi, when did you change your Weibo nickname?”

Her nickname had changed from ‘My Lonely Empty Loss’ to ‘Little Sugar Xi’.

“Oh, it’s because of Lu Tingxiao.” Ning Xi replied.

Jiang Muye’s pupils abruptly contracted, “Lu Tingxiao made you change it? You changed it just because he told you to!? That nickname that you used for so many years? The one that you refused to change no matter how much I made fun of it because you were too lazy? You changed it the moment he told you to!?”

Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him, “Could you stop getting so agitated over nothing? He didn’t make me change it, okay?”

“Then why did you change it?”

“It was because he didn’t get me to change it and he even said that this nickname was pretty good. He wanted me to help him change his nickname to something similar!”

Jiang Muye: “…” Damn! His uncle had some skill at picking up girls! Even something like this could work?

Ning Xi sighed, “It’s fine if a tough guy like me uses this kind of shocking name, but as the CEO of a big corporation, if I somehow influenced him into using Martian language, wouldn’t that be a sin? So I had to somehow persuade him for a long time that Martian language is already outdated, and to prove that, I changed my nickname!”
