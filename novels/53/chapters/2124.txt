Chapter 2125: Three Little Fishes

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the side, Feng Xiaoxiao advised in a low tone too. “Annie, don’t persist on your misguided course. Hand over the antidote, or else, you won’t be able to leave today!”

Annie’s gaze swept across Tang Lang, Tang Ye, and Feng Xiaoxiao indifferently. She suddenly sneered. “Just you three little fishes? You might as well come at me together.”

“Altogether? And even calling us little fish! Wow! Little brat! You really talk big!” Tang Lang was so angry that he laughed.

Bloody hell, she really looked down on him!

Even if Annie might be skilled, he could feel that familiar air from her which meant that they were the same kind, yet she had said such words. Was she not being too arrogant?

As Little Treasure was being resuscitated inside and his condition became more and more critical, Tang Lang could not care much. He immediately charged towards Annie.

In the next second, there was a loud sound. Bam!

Tang Lang… flew to the wall from a slap.

Tang Lang held his chest that was in pain. “What the f*ck?”

A single-move wipe out?

Feng Xiaoxiao and Tang Ye were dumbfounded when they saw this. They only reacted after a few seconds and quickly followed up to charge.

In the end, barely ten seconds had passed when the fight ended.

Feng Xiaoxiao spit out a mouthful of blood. Eeven Tang Ye had to take three steps back as he clutched his chest that was struck by her palm.

Tang Lang’s eyes almost popped out. “Bloody hell! What the f*ck?! How did that happen?”

This was illogical!

The three of them could guess that Annie was quite skilled, but they never would have thought that she could be strong to this extent.

In just a little over ten seconds, she had dealt with Tang Ye, Tang Lang, and Feng Xiaoxiao, the three first-rate masters altogether. What was going on?

When Ning Xi came out and saw that Tang Ye, Tang Lang, and Feng Xiaoxiao had all combined forces, yet were defeated, her expression changed completely.

No one here could handle Annie!

Then, what were they going to do about Little Treasure’s antidote?

Because Ning Xi was so anxious, there was a burning pain in her chest. She quickly said, “Annie, you said that this matter has nothing to do with me. Okay, I won’t care about you and the Lu family’s grudges, but Little Treasure is my son. I can’t just watch him die and do nothing. Now, it’s a matter between the two of us. What do we need to do for you to hand over the antidote?”

“You want the antidote? Sure.”

Ning Xi’s eyes had just lit up when she heard Annie continue, “Defeat me.”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Tang Lang held his chest that was burning from pain as he cursed under his breath, “Bloody hell, what’s the difference whether you said that or not?”

Ning Xi clenched her hands into fists. “Okay! Defeat you? I’ll fight with you!”

Tang Lang cried out, “Little Junior Sister, are you insane?”

Lu Tingxiao’s expression changed ever-so-slightly. “Xiao Xi.”

Yun Shen frowned too.

There was no hint of warmth in Annie’s eyes at all. “You’re no match for me.”

Ning Xi slowly took off the outer layer of clothing on her and casually threw it to the ground. “How would you know if we don’t try?”

Annie was silent as she looked straight at her for three seconds and then finally said, “Okay, take three blows from me. If, after three hits, you can still stand upright, I’ll give you the antidote.”

“Okay!”

Tang Lang immediately cried out in alarm, “What?! Bloody hell, Tang Xi, are you trying to die?! Her one strike almost killed me. Your little body is going to be crushed by her one hit!”

Lu Tingxiao’s expression instantly darkened when he heard this. “Xiao Xi, don’t mess around.”

“Lu Tingxiao, I’m sorry, I can’t obey you this time.” Ning Xi’s gaze was extremely earnest as she looked towards the man before her. “You know this is the only way.”

Little Treasure was on the verge of death. Annie could leave anytime and none of them could stop her.
