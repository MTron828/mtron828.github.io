Chapter 104: Who Doesn’t Have Skeletons In Their Closet?

Feng Haoyang pinched his brow, finally giving up on communicating with her. Trying to explain things to an idiot was absolutely the stupidest thing he could do.

The company had invested a lot into Jia Qingqing, but there was no way to recover from the incident this time. No matter how massive the losses were, they could only give up on recovering them.

Seeing that Feng Haoyang was already decided, Jia Qingqing hurriedly pounced towards Ning Xueluo like she was grasping for life, “Xueluo-jie, you have to help me, let Chang-jie manage me! I guarantee that I’ll be obedient! I promise that I’ll post an apology!”

Hearing so, Chang Li’s expression immediately turned to horror. Letting her manage Jia Qingqing? Ning Xueluo wouldn’t do that, would she?

Of course, Ning Xueluo couldn’t possibly be as braindead as Jia Qingqing. With a troubled expression, she lamented, “Qingqing, it’s not that I don’t want to help you, but you heard what Ning Xi said just now. She’s not willing to help. This is also the company’s decision, so I can’t do anything.”

Once this matter had blown up, she knew that Jia Qingqing was done for. However, she had wanted to use her to drag Ning Xi down to the very end. It was a pity that Feng Haoyang had already seen that apologies wouldn’t do anything at this point and might even drag another actress down, so he had finally decided to give up on Jia Qingqing.

She had thought that Jia Qingqing was a great weapon to use against Ning Xi. Who knew that she would be so stupid as to fall and even boost Ning Xi up along the way? How could she possibly waste any effort on someone like that?

“Ning Xi! You bitch! Just you wait, even if I die, I’m dragging you down with me!” Jia Qingqing finally turned to despair. She tried to vent her anger on Ning Xi, but Feng Haoyang called security and she was finally dragged out.

Ning Xi didn’t even want to waste any energy hating this kind of person. She only had some sympathy for her. She didn’t even know she had been used as cannon fodder up till now.

Feng Haoyang looked towards Ning Xi and his expression warmed up, “Ning Xi, just focus on doing well in your current movie. If the results are good, the company will focus more efforts on raising you. However, Xueluo’s words made sense. Keep a low profile and don’t cause any unneeded trouble.”

From the initial outburst of slander on Ning Xi to the final clearing of her innocence, with the result of forcing Jia Qingqing into retirement, the entie sequence of events seemed like a perfectly executed PR plan.

Although Feng Haoyang suspected that there was someone behind the scenes, he couldn’t find any cracks, so he could only assume that Ning Xi had great luck.

“Thank you, Director Feng, I will.” Ning Xi had pleasant surprise and fear written all over her face.

After leaving the meeting room, Ning Xi went to the restroom and Ning Xueluo hurriedly followed after.

Ning Xueluo crossed her arms over her chest and looked at her mockingly, “Ning Xi, by digging out other people’s skeletons, aren’t you afraid your own skeletons will be dug out of the closet by someone else someday?”

Ning Xi’s eyes narrowed slightly, revealing a cold glint. She immediately turned around and said indifferently, “Who doesn’t have a few skeletons around in this industry? Don’t you have them too? Miss Ning!”

Ning Xi purposely emphasised the surname ‘Ning’, then pretended to have suddenly realised something, “Ah! Speaking of which, doesn’t Jia Qingqing’s ‘mistress masquerading as fake rich heiress’ title suit you a lot? When the time comes for me to expose you, aren’t you saving me the trouble of thinking up a headline?”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It was as if Ning Xueluo’s weak point had been stabbed. She immediately said in rage, “What ‘mistress masquerading as fake rich heiress’! I’ve been in the Ning family since birth and I’m the only daughter that Father acknowledges! As for Su Yan, you failed to prevent his heart from wavering, do you think anyone will believe your nonsense?”

Ning Xi dragged out her words, “Then… shall we try it out? Why don’t I reveal my skeletons as well! There are so many people out there, the whereabouts of the two men you bribed are still unknown. Maybe I’ll have better luck searching for them publicly?”
