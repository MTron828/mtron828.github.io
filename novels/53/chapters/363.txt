“Even I, as a layman, can taste that the food is made by the gods, it’s…too…too delicious!”

“The exact same dish, but a hundred times tastier than the one earlier!”

“This is marvelous, how did they do this? Can someone please explain? We only know that it’s delicious, but don’t know what the trick is! Where’s the journalist just now? Explain quickly!”

“Right! Give us a professional review!”

With the crowd’s urging, the experienced food journalist tasted the food with a somber face but he did not say a word. He then shushed them, closed his eyes and said, “Don’t say anything, I have to remember this taste! This is a once in a lifetime chance!”

This journalist was really not exaggerating as a few other journalists and food bloggers seemed like they were in the throes of pleasure as well as they chewed their food.

In the corner, Xiao Tao’s face was full of happiness, “Ahh! This tastes so good! I also really want to know how is this so delicious?”

Ning Xi looked at the truffles in the plate, and said, “Firstly, the culinary method used is different. The two masters crafted this simple dish almost perfectly.

“The second reason would be the difference in where the food is sourced from. Just as you can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs, the food source is also an important step in the culinary process. If I’m not wrong, the truffles in this dish come from the best truffle harvest region of Alba. Nicknamed ‘The Fruit of God’, you can only harvest so little each time so it’s extraordinarily expensive. You just have to take in the essence of it, and then you will now know how amazing they are after cooking it…”

Xiao Tao widened her eyes, “No wonder it’s so delicious! Oh my! I feel like I’m eating gold!”

She looked at Ning Xi full of admiration, “Sis Xi, you know so much!”

Ning Xi smiled, “Because I quite like to cook myself, I do some research regularly. I can make some for you next time but I’m afraid that you won’t eat my cooking anymore after eating the master’s dish!”

“No way! It’s Sis Xi’s personal handmade dish, it wouldn’t be the same!”

…

As Ning Xi explained, people around were listening as well. They had a moment of sudden realization and they waited for the journalist’s confirmation.

The food journalist nodded, “It seems like Ms. Ning Xi knows her stuff! No wonder her admirer invited these two masters today.

Aside from Ning Xueluo, Su Yan, and Fang Ya’s group, everyone enjoyed the dinner tremendously.

Su Yan looked really unhappy. Tonight’s celebration dinner was supposed to be for Xueluo. In the end, the spotlight shifted to Ning Xi because of the mystery admirer.

Su Yan looked at Ning Xueluo out of the corner of his eye and saw that she had a very gloomy look on her face.

But Su Yan could understand that anyone would have been upset. It was a once in a lifetime proposal but now all the romantic preparation had gone to waste.

Shortly, Su Yan gritted his teeth and made a decision. He quietly walked to a secluded corner and made a phone call.

…

“Father, this is the situation right now so I’d like to have you ask Uncle He for help. If not, Xueluo and I…” Su Yan explained.

Su Yan did not have a jolly expression on his face and it seemed like the tone of voice from the other end of the phone was unkind.
