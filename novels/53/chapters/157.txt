Chapter 158: Move Further Away From Me

“Right, right?” Ning Xi put her hands together in a pleading pose, a hopeful expression on her face and stars in her eyes. On one hand, it was to butter up Lu Tingxiao. On the other hand, she really did need his help.

Lu Tingxiao remained silent for three seconds before finally speaking the golden word: “Yes.”

“Really? You really have a solution?” Ning Xi was so excited she almost jumped into the air, “Then how long do you need?”

“One…” Lu Tingxiao was about to say one hour, but he suddenly changed his mind, “One night.”

“That fast?! That’s great!” Ning Xi was delighted over the great news and hurriedly pulled out a laptop from her bag, “This is the laptop I took from Zhang Qiang. Do you need anything else? I’ll help you prepare them!”

“There’s no need.” Lu Tingxiao stood up and headed upstairs while speaking.

Ning Xi eagerly followed closely after him.

Upon reaching the study, the perceptive Ning Xi ran to help Lu Tingxiao pull out his chair, then placed the laptop on top of the desk before Lu Tingxiao. She then jogged off to pour a glass of water for him.

Lu Tingxiao shot a casual glance at her before sitting down in the chair.

He then took out his own laptop and brought out a cable to connect the two laptops. After skimming over the evidence she had mentioned, he opened a file and entered a string of complicated-looking code into a window on his laptop screen.

Ning Xi leaned on the desk and moved closer to look out of curiosity, but of course, it looked like gibberish to her. She held a completely dazed expression. Although she couldn’t understand any of it, whatever he was doing still seemed pretty awesome.

While Lu Tingxiao was typing, he heard light breathing near his ear, so he abruptly stopped moving his fingers and started frowning.

“What happened? Is anything wrong?” Ning Xi immediately asked tensely.

Lu Tingxiao’s tone was slightly cool: “Move further away from me.” She was leaning too close, it was affecting his concentration.

“Okay…” Ning Xi shrivelled up like an eggplant in winter and lowered her head. In a sad and dismal manner, she shifted to the furthest corner of the room and sat on the sofa there.

Seeing the girl’s pitiful appearance, Lu Tingxiao almost spoke up to comfort her, but he held back in the end.

Ning Xi hugged a cushion in her arms and quietly watched Lu Tingxiao’s face from the side profile as he was working seriously. She inwardly savoured the sight; it was true that men were the most handsome when they were working earnestly!

Momentarily, only the quiet sound of fingers tapping on the keyboard could be heard in the study.

Ning Xi sat there and struggled with her thoughts for a long while before she finally couldn’t resist and spoke up, “Lu Tingxiao… Can I ask you a question?”

“Go ahead.”

“Why… Why didn’t you ask me?”

“Ask what?”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ning Xi’s fingers clenched into fists, “Ask about that gun! You’re not going to ask why I have a gun? Don’t you think that I’m not like what you expected at all, that I’m… very scary?”

Lu Tingxiao: “Not at all.”

Ning Xi: “Oh…”

Lu Tingxiao didn’t continue questioning her, but Ning Xi felt extremely sorry in her heart. He had always treated her like a friend and helped her without holding back. However, she kept hiding and concealing every little thing about herself.

Thus, even though Lu Tingxiao hadn’t continued questioning her, Ning Xi took the initiative to speak up, “You know how the public order in America isn’t very good, and how having a gun is legal there? I learned how to use a gun when I was there.”

“However, it’s not legal to have guns back here in China. This gun was smuggled in through illegal channels. I don’t know how it was done exactly, it was given to me by a friend, the one who taught me how to shoot. It’s for the sake of self-defense only when I absolutely need it. Since I’ve come back to China, I’ve only used it just this once!”

Lu Tingxiao stopped all movement: “What kind of person is that friend of yours?”
