Jiang Muye fell into a daze for 3 seconds and his ears started to burn up soon after. He pushed her away. “Ning Xiao Xi, you have such a dirty mind!”

“Screw you! Stop pretending to be so innocent and seriously answer your big mama’s question!”

“Why did you ask something like that?” Jiang Muye tried to avoid her eyes, not wanting her to know that what she’d just said had been too graphic and that the only feeling he had was…

“You answer me first!” Ning Xi rushed him.

Jiang Muye hesitated for a long while before finally saying in a blurry voice, “Of… of course I’d go along with it! All normal men would do it, ok? Unless the man didn’t like her in the first place!”

Ning Xi looked at him with a half smile, having gotten her expected answer.

“Why are you looking at me like that? Am I wrong?” Jiang Muye felt uncomfortable with her expression.

“You’re right.”

“Now can you tell me why you asked me that?”

Ning Xi rested her jaw in her hand and said absentmindedly, “Do you know what Lu Tingxiao did when he met with this situation?”

Jiang Muye’s expression changed immediately. “When Lu Tingxiao met with this situation? What do you mean?”

Ning Xi explained the causes and effects briefly. “… then Zhu Xiangcheng tied me up and left me on Lu Tingxiao’s bed!”

“What… What did Lu Tingxiao do?” Jiang Muye’s voice changed out of nervousness.

“He didn’t do anything.” Ning Xi recalled what happened that night. “He comforted me and talked to me to distract me. He didn’t cross the line even a little for the whole night, just quietly kept me company through the most difficult and helpless night of my entire life.”

Jiang Muye bit his lips hard after hearing that. He couldn’t say a word.

Ning Xi stared at him. “Why do you think Lu Tingxiao didn’t do anything? Is he not a normal guy? Does he not like me?”

Jiang Muye tightened his fists. “He likes you for sure!”

The way Lu Tingxiao had handled it didn’t mean that he wasn’t a real man, on the contrary, it proved that he was a man among men… If it had been himself, he couldn’t promise that he would be able to do the same…

Ning Xi nodded. “I wasn’t sure at first and didn’t dare to confirm, but now I’m sure that he likes me, too. So, there is a third possibility.”

That got Jiang Muye’s attention instantly. “What is it?”

“It’s not that I was stupid, it’s that he is on a whole other level. I’m not surprised, nor do I regret having a crush on him at all…” After she spoke, settled compromises appeared in her foggy and cloudy eyes.

Jiang Muye’s voice shook and he could barely finish a full sentence. “You have a crush on him?”

Ning Xi smiled. “Although I don’t want to admit it, and have been avoiding it for so long, it’s the truth.”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Jiang Muye slammed his fist onto the coffee table, hard, and his red eyes exploded with jealousy. “Ning Xi! How much do you know about him? How much? You only see what’s on the surface! You think Lu Tingxiao is really as gentle as he looks? Did you know that Jia Qingqing died in the wilderness? Do you know what happened to Chu Xiangcheng? Did you know that he used the aviation aircraft to make artificial rain, just to stop your kissing scene? And the incident at my house… he is the one behind everything!”

Ning Xi fell into a long silence, then said in a low voice, “But, Jiang Muye, he never did anything to hurt me. If I get scared of him because of all that, keep my distance from him, and resent him, it’s not fair to him. You can think of me as someone who doesn’t know right from wrong or that I’m naive about life-and-death matters, but I only know that he treats me well. Very well. Nobody has ever treated me as well as he does.”
