Chapter 179: That Person’s Sexual Orientation is Undetermined

After she finished speaking, Ning Xi simply ignored the uproar behind her and entered the black car that had just driven up and stopped nearby.

It was all thanks to Lu Tingxiao’s perfect planning. He had most likely predicted that the reporters would come swarming at her today, even the bodyguards and driver had all appeared in the nick of time.

“Miss Xi, where to next?” The driver asked.

“Let’s go home.” Ning Xi paused for a moment and couldn’t resist asking, “Why do you call me Miss Xi and not Miss Ning?”

When she thought carefully about it, the servants in the Lu residence and even Lu Tingxiao’s subordinates all called her Miss Xi, or Miss Xiao Xi…

“It was CEO Lu’s orders.” The driver replied.

“So that’s why…”

That guy was too attentive… He probably knew that she didn’t like the surname Ning!

At the same time, at the Lu residence.

Lu Jingli was collapsed on the sofa like a dead fish, “Bro! You’ve already been browsing through those for an entire day! We have so many brilliant managers at our company, and you didn’t take a liking to any of them? What about Lei Ming? He’s been in the business for a long time, he has lots of experience and connections both here and abroad. He’s already familiar with Ning Xi too!”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Lu Tingxiao: “He’s Jiang Muye’s manager.”

Lu Jingli: “Alright… Then what about Hao Shuai? At least he has nothing to do with Jiang Muye, right?”

Lu Tingxiao: “No males.”

Lu Jingli’s mouth twitched, “Then Ye Shenglan! One of our top managers! Her capabilities are top-notch!”

Lu Tingxiao: “Her sexual orientation is undetermined.”

“Pfft… It’s rumoured that she likes women… Crap! Bro, isn’t your info a little too detailed?!” Lu Jingli’s expression was falling apart, “Then Zhao Meixin should be okay, right? She’s female, has a boyfriend, and she’s the manager of Su Yimo, the number one actress in our company!”

Lu Tingxiao: “Her character fails to meet the standards.”

Lu Jingli was completely speechless. “Even the emperor wasn’t as picky as you when he was selecting his concubines! Then what exactly do you want?”

Lu Tingxiao muttered to himself for a moment before asking: “Why didn’t you give me Lin Zhizhi’s information?”

“Lin Zhizhi’s on break. She said that she doesn’t want to take on a new artiste anytime soon. I’m guessing it’s probably to avoid Jiang Muye, tsk tsk…”

“Then she’ll be Ning Xi’s manager.” Lu Tingxiao said decisively.

“Uh… Bro, you’re too evil… “ Lu Jingli couldn’t help but have a moment of silence for Jiang Muye in his heart. When he was done, it was time to mourn for himself, “You’re really good at giving me extra work! Lin Zhizhi’s already said that she doesn’t want to manage any new artistes!”

As the two of them were in the midst of discussion, Ning Xi returned from outside——

“I’m back! Is anyone at home?”

Just as her voice finished echoing in the house, her leg was hugged by a soft little bun. The little bun even had an aggrieved expression on his face, as if they had parted for three years and not three hours.

The little bun had become really attached to her recently. It was only after Ning Xi hugged and soothed him for a long while that he finally cracked a smile.

“You’re back. Did everything go well with terminating your contract?” Lu Tingxiao walked over to ask.

When he mentioned the contract, Ning Xi got excited, “It went super well! The lawyer that the company arranged for me was really awesome! He fought alone against three lawyers and came out victorious in a war of words! Chang Li was trying to demand an exorbitant 60 million yuan from me at first, but I didn’t have to spend a single cent in the end! Oh wait, I only spent 250 yuan on Ning Xueluo’s medical fees! He was brilliant! Are the lawyers in Golden Age Entertainment’s legal department all so awesome? I heard them call him the great Lawyer Chen…”

At this moment, Lu Jingli slowly spoke up from behind them: “What do you mean the legal department of Golden Age? Chen Jing is the top legal consultant for the Lu Corporation!”

“Pfft…” Ning Xi was so shocked that she would done a spit take if she had been drinking. She turned to Lu Tingxiao in utter disbelief, “Lu Tingxiao, you sent a specialised company lawyer who handles cases covering billions of yuan to help me settle a puny 8 million yuan case?”
