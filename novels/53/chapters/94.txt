Seeing Lu Jingli look like he was requesting a reward, Lu Tingxiao generously spoke up, “You get a month’s holiday.”

Overjoyed, Lu Jingli almost leapt up to dance on the spot. He immediately said with incomparable regret, “Bro, if you keep on doing this, you’ll be wasting your strength. Why didn’t you just immediately pounce on Xiao Xixi? What a waste!”

Lu Tingxiao looked coldly at him in askance, “And what do you think would result from doing that?”

“Uh…” Lu Jingli rubbed his chin and said seriously, “You’ve always used Little Treasure as an excuse to get closer so that she wouldn’t get alarmed and run off. If you exposed your trap at this time… Xiao Xixi would most likely run thousands and thousands of miles away!”

Lu Tingxiao: “…”

Although that was the truth, having Lu Jingli say it out just like that made his mood rather bad.

Actually, he had wanted to find out what she thought about it while acting recklessly last night. However, the extreme fear and rejection that Ning Xi had had instantly forced him awake.

After that, his way of handling it had been proven right. Otherwise, in that situation, Ning Xi would surely have been scared off by him.

Why did she have that kind of reaction? What had she experienced before…

“Bro, can I ask you a question? Why is your mood so unstable lately? Did something happen?” Lu Jingli asked carefully.

He had already been rather tactful in putting it this way. Truthfully, Lu Tingxiao’s temper had been so irritable that he seemed like a girl on her period.

Lu Tingxiao knocked against the armrest of his chair with the joints of his long, slender fingers. He spoke calmly: “The one who sent flowers that day was Jiang Muye.”

“Say what?” Lu Jingli stared in a daze for a long while before finally reacting to Lu Tingxiao’s news. Following that, he jumped up——

“What! Corrupted Devil King is Jiang Muye! Didn’t he just return back the day before yesterday? I even got the news that he was going to be the second male lead for 《Land Under Heaven》!”

He hadn’t thought that he had this kind of relationship with Xiao Xixi. It looked like that kid had suddenly come back for some reason. Furthermore, the first movie he had chosen after coming back was 《Land Under Heaven》. This was food for thought! He had many intimate scenes with Xiao Xixi in the movie tsk tsk…

“Uh, let me think. Has he met with Xiao Xixi recently? And you saw it? You even saw some ambiguous scene?”

Lu Tingxiao: “…”

Lu Jingli’s guesses were all on the money.

“My god, no wonder you haven’t be acting right recently!” Lu Jingli paced wildly on the spot, “Who would have thought that we had a traitor in our ranks! Then what about YS? Did you find that out?”Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Lu Tingxiao’s eyes darkened, “The person who sent the diamond vanished without a trace after leaving the set. Furthermore, the diamond’s origins can’t be traced. It’s most likely smuggled goods brought in from a special channel.”

The corner of Lu Jingli’s mouth twitched upon hearing so. He said somewhat speechlessly, “There’s another headache. It can’t have anything to do with the Lu family this time, right? Y… S… Is there anyone who has those initials by our side? It seems like there isn’t!”

Ah, it was so complicated for his dear brother to get a simple date. Other people had dating lives like some romantic drama, his was practically a mystery detective novel!

At this moment, Lu Tingxiao’s phone rang. It was a message from Ning Xi.

Upon reading the contents, the dangerous creature hibernating in the depths of Lu Tingxiao’s eyes threatened to move.

Lu Jingli moved closer curiously, “Xiao Xixi’s message… what did she say?”

Why did his brother look as if he had been cheated on?

Lu Tingxiao stared at that message for a few more seconds before immediately calling her.

At residence no.6, Ning Xi quickly picked up the call, “Hello, Lu Tingxiao, is anything the matter? Did you see the message I just sent? Remember to show it to Little Treasure!”

“I saw it. Where are you?” Lu Tingxiao asked.

Ning Xi glanced at the kitchen, where Jiang Muye was busy trying to show off his culinary skills, “I’m at Jiang Muye’s place. I have something to discuss with him, plus he just got back, so I’m having a welcome dinner with him.”
