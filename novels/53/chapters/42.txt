Chapter 43: Bite Me Again

Or maybe she should say that it wasn’t him that changed, but rather that he had hidden his true self away and she had never really understood him.

Ning Xi’s gaze inadvertently landed on the traces of blood on the back of his hand, she asked, “Lu… Lu Tingxiao, what happened to your hand?”

Lu Tingxiao glanced sideways at that circle of teeth marks, then looked at her with a hint of a smile, “What do you think?”

Ning Xi swallowed once, “These teeth marks… look a little familiar…”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

There was a trace of praise in Lu Tingxiao’s expression, “Well spotted.”

“Uh, thanks for the compliment.” Ning Xi coughed once and smiled awkwardly before she asked carefully, “I did that?”

“Do you think I’m framing you? You can bite me again to compare.” Lu Tingxiao suggested, before offering his hand to her.

Ning Xi waved her hands, embarrassed, “No need, there is absolutely no need for that! I admit! I admit that I was the culprit! Although… what happened last night? I don’t remember much after drinking, I only recall that I entered the restroom, and I can’t remember anything after that… How did I get back here?”

“You collapsed in the female restroom and I went in to carry you out. You refused to go with me and even bit me.” Lu Tingxiao’s answer was simple and concise.

Ning Xi was stupefied, “You… You entered the female restroom…”

She had really committed a huge sin! The evil demon king had sacrificed way too much…

“Then why am I sleeping in a car?” Ning Xi summoned enough courage to ask.

“Because you refused to part with your little darling.” Lu Tingxiao emphasised the two words ‘little darling’ with a light tone.

Ning Xi glanced at the car she had idolised for so long, and immediately believed what Lu Tingxiao had said.

“I’m so sorry, I’ve caused trouble for you!” Ning Xi apologised weakly.

She felt terribly embarrassed for having caused so much trouble when it was only the second night she was staying over.

Lu Tingxiao did not receive her words, but shot out a seemingly unrelated question, “Why did you drink so much last night?”

Hearing this, Ning Xi’s expression turned solemn.

Seeing her sudden change in expression, the sleeping beast in Lu Tingxiao’s heart started to stir.

Ning Xi did not have the habit of sharing her personal worries with others. However, it felt so terrible keeping it in her heart that she just had to share. She leaned bonelessly against her seat and turned her head upwards to look at the greenery above her head as she mumbled, “I’m afraid that my role as Meng Changge… is gone…”

Astonishment flashed across Lu Tingxiao’s face, “Why?”

“Since it’s only a small role as a supporting female lead, I know that you might not understand my feelings since you’re a CEO. You don’t know how hard I worked for this day, you don’t know how happy I was to get this role… All of you don’t know… “ As she was talking, Ning Xi suddenly raised a hand to cover her eyes.

Lu Tingxiao had assumed that she had lost control over Su Yan and had never thought that the cause would be something else.

She wasn’t upset over Su Yan. Instead, she was upset because she had lost that role?

The gloom he had been feeling the whole night dissipated in an instant. However, seeing how upset the girl was, his heart clenched in sympathy.

How could he not know how important her dream was to her?

Otherwise, why would she have continued stubbornly climbing upwards step by step despite knowing that there were shortcuts she could have taken?

“Don’t be sad, you’ve already done very well.” Lu Tingxiao shifted the girl’s head to rest against his chest.

So the culprit wasn’t Su Yan, but… Ning Yaohua.

Ning Yaohua was the biggest sponsor for the movie?Land Under Heaven?, and he had the right to decide the cast in the end.

No one was allowed to bully his girl, not even her own father.
