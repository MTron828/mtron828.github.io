Ning Xi was woken by the sound of a man’s low voice from the living room the following morning.

Lu Tingxiao put down his phone after hearing the footsteps behind him. He asked with a warm tone, “Did I wake you?”

Ning Xi stared at the man before her, her eyes as wide as saucers.

Lu Tingxiao was not wearing a shirt. So the moment she had pushed the door open, her view had been filled with bare skin. The impact was too much.

She rubbed her nose, luckily she had not done anything embarrassing.

Lu Tingxiao seemed not to have noticed her abnormal expression. Instead he calmly picked up his shirt from the sofa to wear. He said while buttoning up his shirt: “There’s an emergency at work, I have to leave now. Could I trouble you to wake Little Treasure up?”

“Oh, okay!” Ning Xi nodded as she hurried to call for Little Treasure.

In the end, she didn’t have to call for him. She saw a soft, moe, and impossibly cute Pikachu the moment she turned around. It was staring straight at his dear father, Lu Tingxiao, without blinking. His expression was clearly unhappy.

“Little Treasure, go and change your clothes.” Lu Tingxiao put on his coat and ordered his son.

The reaction he got was a ‘Bang!’ as the bedroom door was shut.

Completely ruthless.

Lu Tingxiao: “……”

Ning Xi: “……”

Lu Tingxiao tried the door and found that the door was locked from the inside.

He looked towards Ning Xi, “Do you have the key?”

Ning Xi awkwardly shook her head, “I do, but it’s inside the room!”

Lu Tingxiao pinched his brow as he spoke in a cold tone, “Lu Qingyu, I’m giving you three minutes. Don’t think of ever coming back here if you don’t come out by then.”

Not a single peep sounded from inside after three minutes.

“Lu Qingyu, come out! If you’re going to wait for me to force you out, then I won’t be this easy to speak with!”

Still no movement.

A certain little bun was not leaving a shred of dignity for his father.

Ning Xi was watching from the side and holding back the urge to laugh, “I only have to go to work later, why not let Little Treasure stay here for a while longer?”

Lu Tingxiao’s face was black as he pulled out his cellphone to make a call.

Ning Xi secretly glanced at him and found that he was calling a psychiatrist. She was speechless for a moment. He was calling a psychiatrist for something as small as this? Wasn’t it making a mountain out of a molehill?

Ning Xi coughed lightly and suggested, “Why don’t you let me try?”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lu Tingxiao hesitated for a moment, then nodded his head.

Ning Xi leaned on the door and tried to put on a soft tone, “Little Treasure, auntie has to go to work later on. I can’t take care of you, could you go home with daddy first?”

Still no response from inside.

“How about this, let’s exchange phone numbers so we can contact each other at any time. We can also video call!”

The sound of wavering footsteps sounded from inside.

“The director will scold me if auntie is late. Our director is really fierce, auntie is so pitiful wuuuuuu……”

The door opened.

Lu Tingxiao had been prepared to wage a long war. Thus a trace of astonishment flashed across his eyes. He looked at the woman next to him with a complicated gaze.

She could actually persuade Little Treasure to come out obediently with just three sentences.

Little Treasure had locked himself up in the attic at home the last time this had happened. Their family of four, all the butlers and maids, the psychiatrist and even a negotiation expert had been deployed. They could only tear down the door in the end despite talking till their lips were dry for the entire afternoon. The end result was the little guy ignoring them for an entire month.

Ning Xi did not know of that incident. Of course, she only thought that this child was too obedient. She picked up the little bun. He was miserable yet had still come out because he could not bear the thought of her getting scolded. She praised, “Little Treasure is so obedient, thank you darling!”

The little bun who was praised had his mood raised. He silently handed her a piece of paper with a string of numbers on it.

Ning Xi received the note, “Eh? Is this your phone number? Great, I’ll save it. I’ll definitely call you once I’m free!”

Lu Tingxiao thought something was strange. Little Treasure did not have a phone, so where did he get that phone number?

He glanced over borrowing his height advantage- it was his phone number.

Not bad, as expected of his son!
