Chapter 36: Which God of Wealth Has Arrived?

“Su-gege, why are you here? Didn’t I say that there’s no need to pick me up?” Ning Xueluo skipped over to the man happily.

“I couldn’t stop worrying since it started raining outside.” Su Yan took off his jacket and put it on her. He looked at her unhappily, “Why are you wearing so little?”

Ning Xueluo had a sweet expression on her face, “Oh you, I’m already a grown woman! Why are you still treating me like a child?”

Ning Xi leaned against the icy cold wall with uneven steps. She felt that she was really unlucky today.

For the whole night, she had been treated to Ning Xueluo’s show of parental affection, and now it was a lovey-dovey scene.

Ning Xueluo was completely showing off everything she had taken away from her…

Not satisfied with just making her watch, Ning Xueluo hugged Su Yan’s arm and purposely walked towards her. She said warmly, “Little junior, you seem to be quite drunk. Why don’t you join us? I’ll let my boyfriend send you home!”

Ning Xueluo deliberately emphasised the word ‘boyfriend’.

At this moment, Su Yan finally noticed Ning Xi. His pupils abruptly tightened upon seeing her.

Ning Xi…

It had been a long time.

In the years she had been overseas, he had not seen her even once. Even after she had returned, he had only seen her a few times from afar when he went to pick Xueluo up at the company.

He was caught off guard by seeing her up close. She was so different that he almost couldn’t recognise her.

The little girl who had worn braids and a flowery skirt back then, had blossomed into a woman who could move any man’s heart without his knowing…

Seeing that Su Yan was looking at Ning Xi dazedly, a dark emotion flashed across Ning Xueluo’s eyes. She grabbed his arm and shook it, “Su-gege, what do you say?”

Su Yan suddenly regained his senses and nodded hastily, “Yes, let’s go together.”

“Junior Ning… Junior Ning? Are you okay?” Ning Xueluo showed a caring expression.

Ning Xi pressed on her forehead with the back of her hand. Her mind was growing more and more hazy under the influence of alcohol. Her heart was beating faster and her blood was almost rushing backwards. It was as if there was a beast roaring inside her body, struggling to break free so that it could tear up the two pretentious masks in front of her…

“No need…” Ning Xi turned and stumbled towards the restroom before she completely lost control.

Watching Ning Xi’s sorry figure escape, Ning Xueluo finally let out a refreshed smile. However, her expression immediately changed into an extremely sad one when she turned towards Su Yan, “Su-gege, I think Xiao Xi isn’t willing to forgive me… I’m already trying my best to make it up to her… I’ve been doing whatever I can to help her in the company, but she’s still like this. I don’t know what to do anymore…”

“Don’t mind it! Xiao Xi’s personality is like that, she’ll forgive you when time passes!” Su Yan reassured her softly.

At the ground floor of the hotel, a group of girls from the crew were excitedly discussing the sports car Su Yan had driven in on.

“I just searched online and I found out that this Maserati is at least 100 million yuan! He’s way too rich!”

“I want to find a rich boyfriend too, how many years will it take till I can find one?”

“Most importantly, he’s so handsome! There are so many stars who married someone rich, but they’re all pot-bellied middle-aged men… Just looking at them makes my stomach churn…”

……

As they were gossiping, they spotted Su Yan and Ning Xueluo walking towards them from the hotel.

The picture of a handsome man and a beautiful woman standing together was simply a feast for the eyes.

Everyone looked on enviously as Ning Xueluo entered that sports car, still wearing Su Yan’s jacket. They waited until they could no longer see the car before sighing…

Not long after that car had left, the roar of an engine could be heard heading towards them. Following that, a silvery white sports car zoomed past them and came to a stop in front of the hotel.

Most importantly, this car…

This car was too damn outstanding!

That handsome low chassis, smooth body and cool scissor doors gave off the feeling of a masterpiece…Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Most importantly, the price…

“What the, that’s the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, the world’s most expensive supercar… It costs over a billion yuan at the very least… My god… which god of wealth has arrived…”

TL Note: The Bugatti Veyron Super Sport apparently costs USD1.4 million o.o
