Chapter 151: She Couldn’t Even Dote on Him Enough

The little bun had spent so much effort preparing a birthday present and surprise for her. He must have been so excited in the beginning, only to experience cold loneliness when the day came, followed by panic when he couldn’t reach her…

How painful must the whole process have been to him?

Upon thinking that, Ning Xi felt as though a knife was being twisted in her heart. She hugged Little Treasure, not wanting to let him go for even a second.

Lu Tingxiao didn’t want to disturb the two of them, but for the sake of that small trace of brotherly affection left in him, he still issued a reminder, “Ning Xi, ask Little Treasure to recall those robots.”

“Ohhhh right…” It was only then that Ning Xi remembered that there was a horde of fierce robots revolting and tearing down the residence. Lu Jingli’s arm was still stuck in their hands!

Thus, she quickly spoke to the little bun, “Darling, could you call them back?”

Little Treasure nodded. He then turned to face the screen and his stubby little fingers flew nimbly across the keyboard.

Ning Xi gasped in amazement as she watched. With adoration written all over her face, she exclaimed, “Darling, how are you this clever? I thought you only knew how to draw! You’re really super, super, super clever! I spent the past few years studying everything I could like a maniac. However, this was the only thing I couldn’t learn for the life of me. What the heck is coding, C and C++? They’re practically the stuff of my nightmares. You’re only five years old, yet you’re already such a pro! You’re a genius!!”

Even though the little bun’s expression was still wooden, the light in his eyes had brightened considerably.

However, Lu Tingxiao standing off to the side couldn’t continue watching. He sighed gently, “Ning Xi, you shouldn’t be praising him in this situation.”

“Uh… right!” Ning Xi finally remembered that the little bun had caused a huge mess.

She scratched her head awkwardly and looked at Lu Tingxiao, “Are you going to ask me to tell him not to do this again? He really has followed through with what he promised me previously. Although he doesn’t go on hunger strikes or throw things around anymore, he turned to more sophisticated methods in the end! What if he comes up with an even more sophisticated plan next time if I tell him not to do this again?”

Lu Tingxiao, “…” That was actually quite possible, considering this was Little Treasure they were talking about.

Ning Xi spread out her hands in helplessness, “In short, I think it’s better not to scold him.”

Truthfully, she was being selfish. She didn’t want to criticise the little bun given the circumstances today. She loved him so dearly and she couldn’t even dote on him enough. How could she bear to say any harsh words to him?

Thankfully, Lu Tingxiao didn’t force the issue in the end.

For the most part, his principles were as solid as floating clouds when he was with Ning Xi.

The three of them rode the golf cart back to the entrance of the residence.

Ning Xi stared in astonishment at the magnificent scene before her: the troublemaking robots had formed two neat columns lining the path, as if welcoming them home.

The only mood killer was anguished howling coming from the side——

“Bro, why did you guys take so long?! My arm was freaking dislocated while waiting for you!!”

“It’s just a dislocated arm, do you really need to cry like that?” Ning Xi rolled her eyes and jumped out. She pushed down his arm, giving it a tug and lift, which resulted in a ‘pop’.

“OW——” Lu Jingli shrieked like a pig getting slaughtered.

Ning Xi patted his arm, “Stop howling! It’s healed already. Try it out!”

“Huh?” Lu Jingli blinked and moved his arm a little. It really was fine now.

However, he still muttered, unconvinced, “You wouldn’t have set it back crooked, right?”

“No way! I’m very experienced at fixing dislocated arms!” Ning Xi replied with total confidence.

Doubt was written all over Lu Jingli’s face, “May I ask how you got so much experience with this sort of thing?”

Ning Xi: “Because I used to fight with Jiang Muye quite often. His arm got dislocated quite a few times, and I always realigned it for him!”

Lu Jingli, “…”

Are you sure you were fighting and you weren’t just beating him up one-sidedly?

He was really worried for his bro’s future. Was his bro going to become a victim of domestic abuse in the future? Forget it, what was he worrying about? Even if his bro was abused, his bro would definitely receive it happily…
