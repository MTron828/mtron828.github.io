Chapter 196: Complete Pandemonium

Translator: Henyee  Editor: Henyee

After the press conference, netizens’ anger had reached unprecedented heights:

[Starlight Entertainment did a splendid job, this kind of bitch really should be blacklisted!]

[She’s still so arrogant after her wrongdoing, are you kidding me? It’s just a shame for <The World>, which had such a great script!]

[Why are you all just scolding Ning Xi? I hope someone stands up to hit her!]

[I think Ning Xueluo is too soft-hearted, she should just file a case against her!]

[Who the hell is the sponsor helping Ning Xi do all this? Dox him!]

…

Not only that, if somebody stood up for Ning Xi, everyone would rush to attack that person, making it so that no one dared to disagree.

She had probably made Ning Xueluo desperate. It was obvious that she wanted to finish Ning Xi off with one blow, and suppress her to the point that she would be unable to recover.

As Ning Xi refreshed the page, she realized something was wrong. Her Weibo account was suddenly going crazy with people mentioning her, and the comments were starting to pile up rapidly…

Eh, what happened?

The screen on her phone blacked out several times before Ning Xi was finally able to open it with difficulty. Then she finally understood what was happening.

Just now, Lu Jingli had posted a message on Weibo —

Fancy Little Carp Prince: Welcome, classmate Ning Xiao Xi, to our Glory World family~ @NingXi

Bloody hell!!!

Ning Xi couldn’t stop staring wide-eyed at the message. She even thought she might have misread it.

Lu Jingli this guy, wasn’t he a little too high-profile?

As soon as it was posted, all of Weibo exploded, and all the netizens came flocking in.

[F***! What did I see? Ning Xi that bitch actually joined Glory World Entertainment?]

[I don’t believe it, I don’t believe it, I don’t believe it! Someone must have hacked into my adorable little carp’s account! That must be it! ]

[That’s right, that’s right! In the industry, Glory World Entertainment is well-known for its good reputation. There is no way they would sign Ning Xi this despicable, shameless bitch!]

[If this is true, then Glory World’s reputation will be forever tarnished! I’ll never watch anything starring Glory World artistes ever again!]

[I always thought well of Lu Jingli, I never thought that he would be the one helping her behind the scenes! That’s so disappointing! They could sign anyone, why sign this kind of person? Just because she’s beautiful?]

[Shit! Don’t tell me Ning Xi slept with my Carp Prince male god! No one stop me! I want to kill her!]

…

Ning Xi face-palmed. She knew it would be like this…

Did Lu Jingli this guy have to be this impatient? Why didn’t he wait until after the press conference to announce it? This was just asking to be scolded on purpose!

Seeing the furore of the crowd, which was even affecting other Glory World artistes as online users started to scold and curse them on their Weibo accounts, Ning Xi was wondering whether she should do something or not, when in the next second, she suddenly saw something that utterly dumbfounded her.

What what what… what did she see…

She actually saw that Lu Tingxiao’s main account had forwarded Lu Jingli’s Weibo post!!!!

Lu Tingxiao’s main account was lifeless, full of generic things such as the corporation’s anniversary, the setting up of new departments, the completion of important project collaborations, or professional economic theory that nobody could understand, but seemed awesome anyway…

But Lu Tingxiao had a lot of fans.

He was a male god, so even if he only updated after half a year, and it was all advertisements, there were still brainless fans who followed his account.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Now, Lu Tingxiao, who was only concerned with big corporation news, had forwarded Lu Jingli’s Weibo post, and had even typed a few words: Welcome, Ning Xi.

This wasn’t just something as simple as pandemonium anymore. Traffic on Weibo immediately surged. The system couldn’t bear the load, and even crashed for several minutes before it could recover…
