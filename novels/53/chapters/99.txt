Chapter 100: Older Sister is Aiming for the Stars

“Just jump right down, quickly! And stop acting like you’re some virtuous lady!” Jiang Muye urged her like his pants were on fire.

Speechless, the corner of Ning Xi’s mouth twitched before she held onto the windowsill and threw herself out.

Jiang Muye immediately pulled her over. After spinning her around a few times and seeing that there weren’t any traces of night activities on her, he stared at her with a burning gaze, “Did anything happen last night?”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ning Xi almost fainted from being turned around in circles. She said unhappily, “Jiang Muye, it’s so early in the morning, why are you throwing a fit out here instead of staying in bed? I was just sleeping peacefully, what could have happened to me?”

His veins were popping on his forehead as he said, “Ning Xi! Are you a pig? Don’t tell me you don’t know how you got here last night!”

“I really don’t know!” Ning Xi had an innocent expression.

Jiang Muye took in a deep breath before he could calm himself down. Gritting his teeth, he said, “You’re so stupid, I wonder how you haven’t been taken away by someone and sold already! It was Lu Tingxiao who carried you back personally last night!”

Hearing this, Ning Xi seemed to be a little scared, before she objected, “So what? Then it must have been my darling Little Treasure who couldn’t bear to wake me and asked his dad to carry me back!”

Since that had been the case when they were in the bar, where Little Treasure wouldn’t let anyone else touch her except Lu Tingxiao, she didn’t think much of this.

Jiang Muye almost expired from frustration, “Ning Xi, could you be a little more cautious? Lu Tingxiao clearly has some intentions towards you, okay?”

Ning Xi heaved a long sigh, before placing her arms on Jiang Muye’s shoulders. She said with utmost sincerity, “Brother, this older sister is aiming for the stars, I won’t stop for any random love interests. Even if you kneel down and beg for me to be your aunt, I won’t give you the chance, okay? Please stop with your delusions, take a shower and go back home to sleep!”

When he heard this, Jiang Muye’s mood was complicated. While he heaved a sigh of relief, at the same time, he stared at her with a conflicted expression, “Don’t tell me you really don’t intend on marrying at all for the rest of your entire life? What if you meet someone you like? Ning Xiao Xi, this way of thinking is dangerous and you shouldn’t be having thoughts like that, you know? Let me tell you, although your career is important, for a woman, marriage should be… AH——”

Ning Xi had been unable to resist any longer and had thrown a kick over, “Jiang Muye, are you done yet? Are you trying to pick a fight with me? I see that it’s been too long since I beat you up and you’re itching for a beating!”

“You just beat me up yesterday!”

“Then I clearly didn’t beat you enough the last time. This older sister is going to beat you into submission today, let’s see if you still dare to spout nonsense!”

Jiang Muye fled in terror, and suddenly looked behind her and shouted, “Uncle…”

Ning Xi sneered sinisterly, “Uncle? Even if you cry uncle, no one’s going to come help you!”

Just as Ning Xi’s claws were about to strike, Jiang Muye shouted loudly, “No… it’s my uncle!”

Ning Xi’s back stiffened and she turned her head over mechanically. Lu Tingxiao was standing there in workout attire, sweat rolling down his skin. From the looks of it, he had just finished a morning jog.

Since she had been caught red-handed on the scene beating up his nephew, Ning Xi tried to think of something to say. She immediately pointed at Jiang Muye and said, “Mr Lu, this guy came over early in the morning to smash the windows of your house. I discovered him and I was preparing to beat him up for you!”

Jiang Muye glared at her, “Shameless…”

“Do you dare to claim that you didn’t smash them!” Ning Xi said sternly and righteously.

Lu Tingxiao reached out to remove a strand of grass in the girl’s hair, before stroking her head with his large palm as if it was a natural thing to do, “Don’t fool around. Go and wash up, it’s time for breakfast.”

“Yessir, I’m going now!” Pleased with herself, Ning Xi made a face at Jiang Muye before skipping away.

Jiang Muye hated that he couldn’t grab her and shout wildly at her: It’s not once, nor twice but three freaking times! Lu Tingxiao is already acting so obvious, can’t your freaking dog eyes see it?
