Chapter 162: My Wife is Too Cute

When the butler called Qin Mufeng, he had been pulled to a bar by Lu Jingli and they were exchanging gossip while drinking.

When they heard that Ning Xi had fainted, the two of them immediately rushed to the hospital.

In the First People’s Hospital, the VIP ward on the top floor.

The moment Qin Mufeng and Lu Jingli reached the ward, they saw Ning Xi lying on the bed, her face as white as snow. She was hooked up to an IV, and Lu Tingxiao was sitting by her bed with an imposing, overcast expression.

Lu Jingli and Qin Mufeng exchanged glances, clearly frightened by Lu Tingxiao’s face.

At this moment, a nurse walked in carrying a tray of medicine. Lu Jingli hurriedly pulled her aside to ask quietly, “How’s the patient? What’s the problem? Is it serious?”

“The patient is running a fever at 39.6 degrees celsius.” The nurse replied.

“Oh, a fever… What? A fever?” Lu Jingli was stupefied, “Are you sure it’s a fever? It’s just a fever?”

“Yes, we’re sure. We’ve already done a full body check up, there’s no problem at all, please don’t worry. The mister in the ward has already asked us quite a few times.” The nurse replied without a shred of impatience, because… the guy in the ward, and these two standing at the entrance… were too handsome! She was willing to answer them even if they asked her the same question a hundred times over!

Lu Jingli held onto the door frame weakly and patted his still pounding heart, “Bro, are you trying to scare me to death? She’s only having a fever, why do you look like she just got a terminal disease?”

Qin Mufeng also showed a helpless expression, “You even called me over. Although I’m a doctor, I heal minds, not the body!”

Lu Tingxiao raised his gaze and swept a cold glance at Qin Mufeng, “Since Ning Xi has already replaced you, perhaps I should save on this expense.”

He clearly meant that he was going to fire him.

The amount that he paid Qin Mufeng every year wasn’t cheap.

“Uh, please don’t! Other than curing Little Treasure, I have other uses! I’m acquainted with a famous nutritionist in this hospital, I’ll call him over now to create a nutrition plan for Ning Xi!”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qin Mufeng felt a little guilty. Ever since Ning Xi had come, he had been rather idle. Little Treasure and Lu Tingxiao hardly needed him now, even their weekly therapy sessions had been cancelled.

After Qin Mufeng left, Lu Jingli saw that Lu Tingxiao had his head bent over his phone and couldn’t help asking, “Bro, what are you looking at?”

When had his brother become a youngster addicted to the Internet?

In the end, when he walked closer, he was shocked.

His brother had actually copied the surveillance footage from before into his phone.

“What the heck! Bro, what are you doing watching this? Xiao Xixi looks so scary, when I was watching this video, I felt goosebumps all over! I can’t tell if she’s acting or if she’s for real…” Lu Jingli shivered as he spoke.

However, right now, his brother was actually playing it on loop and even had a mystical expression that practically broadcasted his thoughts: my wife is too cute…

He was really… beyond hope…

“Really, your two hearts are linked as one, even the way you think is the same! Simple and violent! Tsk tsk, you’re really one family!” Lu Jingli lamented.

Lu Tingxiao stroked the face of the girl lying on the sick bed, his pride in her as clear as day.

To prevent his single dog eyes from getting blinded, Lu Jingli turned his head away from the overly romantic sight, “You must have found the culprit’s identity by now, right? Is the next step announcing it on the Internet to help Xiao Xixi clear her name? I’ll go do it right now?”
