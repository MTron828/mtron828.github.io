Chapter 123: A Kiss to Stake His Claim

It was only after Ning Xi had returned that Jiang Muye could finally relax, “Why did you take so long? I almost thought you fell into the toilet bowl!”

“Something worse happened; I fell into a wolves’ den!” Ning Xi leaned back against the sofa, her face still containing traces of lingering fear.

“What do you mean?” Jiang Muye’s brows drew together.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“I walked into the wrong room. That room was full of the big shots of this city, and there was even this wretched fatty who forcefully held onto me and refused to let me go. He even made me accompany him in drinking!”

“What did you say?” Jiang Muye’s expression immediately changed. He looked her up and down with anxiety, “Then how did you get back here?”

Ning Xi hummed, “That’s because I had good luck; I ran into the boss of the big shots!”

Hearing this, Jiang Muye’s expression darkened, “Don’t tell me it was Lu Tingxiao?”

Ning Xi snapped her fingers, “Bingo! That’s right! Big Boss Lu was too cool! He appeared right in the nick of time to save me from the fire and he even escorted me back to the right room himself!”

Jiang Muye: “…” Wasn’t Lu Tingxiao supposed to have high IQ and low EQ? Was this smooth man really the same Lu Tingxiao that he knew?

After the dinner ended, everyone said their goodbyes one by one.

“Ning Xi, how are you going home? Do you want me to send you?” Ye Linglong asked.

“Thank you, Ye-jie! There’s no need, I have a friend nearby, my friend will send me home.”

“Then I’m leaving first!”

“Okay, be careful on the road!”

“Muye, how about you? How are you leaving?” Guo Qisheng asked.

“I’m waiting for my manager.”

“Alright, then see you all tomorrow. If the weather permits, we’ll continue filming today’s scene. Wasn’t it strange that it rained and hailed today?” Guo Qisheng mumbled gloomily.

As the crew left one by one, only Ning Xi and Jiang Muye remained at the entrance.

Bored and drunk, Ning Xi was close to her limits. She was leaning against the golden pillar at her back with half-lowered eyes, looking like a dead dog.

Jiang Muye cast a sideways glance at her, “Ming-ge will be arriving soon. Don’t bother waiting for your friend, just go back with me! Wait a minute, don’t tell me the one you’re waiting for is…”

Before he could finish his words, a man dressed in a suit walked out from the hotel lobby. Under the moonlight, his steady footsteps carried him to Ning Xi, who was currently dozing off. His voice sounded like the breeze on a summer night, “Ning Xi.”

Ning Xi blurrily opened her eyes, “Lu Tingxiao…”

The man before her had already become her safe harbour. The moment his figure appeared in her sights, she collapsed to the side as she let go of her last bit of consciousness…

Seeing the situation, Jiang Muye was shocked; before he could reach out to support her, someone else had already gotten there first. The girl collapsed safely into his arms.

Lu Tingxiao tidied the girl’s messy hair with a warm gaze, before his other arm reached under her knees and he picked her up with ease.

At the same time, a black Maybach had already stopped by the entrance silently; the driver speedily alighted and held the car door open.

Seeing that Lu Tingxiao was treating him as if he didn’t exist and was about to carry Ning Xi into the car, Jiang Muye finally couldn’t hold back his impulse any longer. He quickly switched on the sound recording function on his phone before shouting from behind them, “Uncle!”

Lu Tingxiao’s footsteps paused. He only turned the slightest back and questioned him with his gaze, as if he was asking whether something was the matter.

Jiang Muye gritted his teeth. Did he even have to ask what the problem was? Could he not show such a matter-of-fact expression?

“What intentions do you have towards Ning Xi!” Jiang Muye stared directly at him and spoke straightforwardly.

Hearing this, Lu Tingxiao lowered his gaze to look at the girl sleeping peacefully in his arms, “Towards Ning Xi…”

“Yes! Don’t you think your attitude towards Ning Xi is strange? Isn’t it too ambiguous?” Jiang Muye resisted the strong pressure from the man and continued speaking. At the same time, he gripped the phone in his hands tightly, waiting anxiously for the man’s reply.

Lu Tingxiao looked at the young man before him with an indifferent gaze, “I believe I’ve made my intentions clear enough. If you still don’t understand…”

In the next second, Jiang Muye’s pupils abruptly contracted!

The man in front of him didn’t speak, but lowered his head and lightly touched the girl’s lips with his own instead.

After three seconds, the man withdrew with an expression of utmost yearning and affection. Before he left, his cold gaze shot towards the dumbstruck young man behind him, “Is it clear now?”
