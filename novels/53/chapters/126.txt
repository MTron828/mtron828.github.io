Chapter 127: I’ll Do Whatever You Want

When she arrived on set, Ning Xi was told that the filming schedule had been completely changed, the reason being that Jiang Muye had gone on leave due to family issues.

That fellow, he would grumble by her side for half the day when it came to things that mattered as much as a fart. Yet he hadn’t even mentioned anything to her when something so big had happened?

Ning Xi immediately called him to ask.

Jiang Muye’s tone didn’t sound very good, “Why would I talk to you about it? Weren’t you resenting me for giving you trouble? Didn’t you want me to mind my own business? Didn’t you want me to get as far away from you as possible! Well, your wish has been granted!”

Hearing this, Ning Xi’s temper rose, “Jiang Muye, did you eat gunpowder?”

Jiang Muye was feeling extremely stifled. He was angry at himself, angry over the fact that he had been so stupid. Finally, he suppressed his emotions and calmed down before speaking, “I’m at my dad’s company now and I’ve been running about like a dog the whole day. I can’t get away from this mess. If you have the time tonight, login to the game. I sent something to you. Happy birthday!”

“Also, I sent some things to your email. Look at them yourself, it’s up to you whether you want to believe them or not! That’s all, bye!”

“This fellow…” Ning Xi looked at her phone grudgingly after the call cut.

At this moment, Guo Qisheng came over to inform her, “Ning Xi, I believe you’ve heard about Muye’s matter! You were supposed to continue filming that kissing scene today, but we’ve switched it to a match between you and Xueluo. I’ll get someone to send you the new schedule later!”

Ning Xi nodded, “I got it, Director!”

Having said so, she found a remote corner and nestled under the shade of a tree to read the script.

While engrossed in reading, the sound of footsteps came to her ears. From the corner of her eyes, she caught sight of a figure that brought up a natural response of disgust; it was Su Yan who was walking over.

It had been Su Yan who had sent over Ning Xueluo today. Since it was her birthday, Su Yan had applied for a day’s leave and had been accompanying her all day on set. The ladies on set were all going crazy from jealousy.

Ning Xi didn’t have the patience to speak with him, so she only lifted her gaze, asking him whether he had any business with her.

Su Yan held out an ice-cold beverage to her before carefully asking, “Xiao Xi, you’ll come to Xueluo’s birthday, right?”

Ning Xi didn’t take the bottle. She looked at him as if she were looking at an idiot, “Are you sure you want to ask me such an obvious question?

“Xiao Xi, it’s your birthday today as well. If you can come, we can celebrate your birthday too! I’ve already spoken to Uncle and Aunt about it, and they’ve agreed!”

Ning Xi rolled her eyes, “Wow, thanks for celebrating my birthday in passing!”

Su Yan’s brows drew together in a frown before he gave a long sigh, “Ning Xi, I feel like I don’t know you anymore. When can you return to being the kind and considerate Xiao Xi from back then… Ultimately, everything that had happened back then was my fault. If not for me, Xueluo wouldn’t have done something like that. If you want to blame someone, then blame me. Xueluo is innocent. All these years, she’s been living in guilt. What she really hopes for is to get your blessing. I really hope you can come!”

“Guilt?” Every time she spoke with Su Yan, Ning Xi felt like she was listening to a huge joke, “Is she guilty that she’s occupying my position? Guilty that she stole away my parents? Guilty that she slept with my man? Then she really has enough to be guilty about! Also, don’t mention being kind to me. Back then, I wasn’t being kind, I was being a damn idiot!”

Su Yan’s expression turned ugly, but he continued speaking with a staunch look, “Xiao Xi, as long as you agree to forgive Xueluo, other than having me testify in court, I’ll do whatever you want!”

“Are you sure?” Ning Xi raised an eyebrow.

“I’m sure.” Su Yan nodded.
