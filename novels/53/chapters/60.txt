Chapter 61: Oh My Dear Grandson

Ning Xi slipped away and ran to the washroom behind her. She dove into a cubicle and opened a large, black duffel bag. She pulled out her tools and started to put on makeup.

When she came out from the washroom, Ning Xi had already turned into a white-haired old lady.

The ringtone for a text message notification sounded on her phone.

Ning Xi pulled out her phone to look, and it was indeed from Jiang Muye.

Corrupted Devil King: Ning Xi! I’m giving you 5 minutes to appear in front of me, or I’m going to announce our relationship!

Damnit!

Ning Xi checked her makeup for one last time, then hurriedly ran to the most packed area of the crowd.

She put on an expression of helplessness and anxiety and coughed twice, “Please let me pass, excuse me… My dear kind girls, could you let this old lady look at Ah Ye?”

“Ah! Don’t push! There’s a very old lady here!”

“Uh, grandmother, why do you want to see our Muye? Don’t tell me you’re Muye’s fan too!”

“Oh my goodness! Our Muye attracts young and old! He even has a grandmother fan! Everyone, quick, let this grandmother pass!”

“Grandmother, how old are you?”

……

Ning Xi stooped over and beat on the small of her back, thanking them continuously, “Dear girls, thank you, thank you all. I’m already 80. I like this little fellow a lot, because he looks especially like my grandson! My grandson is currently working in a place very far away, I only get to see him a few times a year…” After saying so, she started to wipe away tears.

“Muye! Muye! You have a grandmother fan here! Please meet her!”

“Yeah, please meet her at least once! She’s quite pitiful…”

With the enthusiastic support from the fans, Ning Xi was quickly pushed to the front.

At the center of the crowd, Jiang Muye used his fingers to comb back his unruly blond hair. He took off his sunglasses and a trace of suspicion flashed across his handsome face, “A grandmother fan?”

“Yes, yes! She’s almost 80! She came specially to the airport on such a hot day just to meet you! She said she really likes you because you look like her grandson, who’s working overseas!”

As the fans finished speaking, Jiang Muye followed the path that the crowd had opened up, and spotted a wrinkled old lady wearing tatty coarse clothes, holding onto a cane.

Jiang Muye’s expression instantly became extremely warped, “The f…”

He used the last of his reason to hold back the rest of the curse, and glared at that ‘old lady’ as if he wanted to strangle her to death.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Of course, this all happened within a second, so the fans didn’t detect his abnormality.

“Ah… my grandson… my good grandson… Grandma misses you so much…” Ning Xi fell onto Jiang Muye with a sudden stride forward. She ruffled his hair messily, crying like she had a broken heart.

Everyone at the scene watched this warm and touching moment, and they followed along crying like the rain. The media’s shutter sounds also fired off constantly.

“Ning Xi! You just wait till tonight!” Jiang Muye gritted his teeth as he whispered into her ear.

“Ah, my grandson, my dear grandson! Why have you become so thin! Grandma’s heart hurts for you!” Ning Xi was really into the act, the hair that Jiang Muye was most vain about had already been ruffled into a bird’s nest.

Seeing that Jiang Muye was close to letting go of his anger and was about to explode, his manager, Lei Ming, came out to help him out of trouble, “Uh, everyone, please give way. This grandmother got a little too emotional and her body seems rather weak, so we’re going to help send her home!”

Jiang Muye kept up a warm and caring expression, but pinched a certain someone’s hand viciously in secret, and quickly left the airport.
