Chapter 83: Kissed Awake

Late in the night, Ning Xi was lying in bed with a million thoughts running through her head.

She wouldn’t bring handsome guys home. All of them would attempt to fool around with her anyways, and all those who tried would end up getting beaten up in an alleyway.

Especially when she saw married men with ring marks on their fingers, she would beat them until they cried for their mothers.

As for her sex life…

Plainly speaking, it was a tragedy. The only time she had ever done it was that night five years ago…

It was most likely the shadow of her first time affecting her. She always felt disgust towards sex.

Lu Tingxiao had been provoked beyond his limit tonight. However, she had no other choice. She would have to eventually bring up the topic of leaving anyway, why not do so and leave before she could no longer control the situation?

Leaving him first was always better than watching him leave when the ugliest parts of her past were bared before him.

Her unstable emotions caused all sorts of messy nightmares to haunt her in her sleep.

In the blurry dreamscape, various voices were screaming by her ears…

“Ning Xi, what right do you have to fight with me? Other than being related by blood, you’re just a good-for-nothing with nothing to her name!”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“You still have the guts to ask about that bastard? What are you trying to do? Don’t tell me you were planning to give birth to him and raise him?”

“The child was born premature and died when he was born. I’ve already taken care of the corpse!”

“Ning Xi, I’m telling you. From now on, I, Ning Yaohua, no longer have a daughter like you! You’re no longer related to our Ning family!”

“Xiao Xi, I’m sorry, let’s break up! I won’t stop caring for you, I’ll treat you like my dear little sister…”

……

She ran with all her might, running and running, trying to leave those terrible voices…

She ran to the roof of the hospital, and there was a bottomless abyss below. That abyss seemed to hold some devilish attraction, pulling her to move forward, step by step…

Finally, she closed her eyes and jumped…

In the instant she jumped, she wasn’t shocked awake like usual, but she fell into a charming and gentle dream.

This time, it wasn’t a nightmare, but… a lustful dream…

She had had these kinds of dreams in the past, but they had always been accompanied by overwhelming fear and helplessness. However, it seemed to be different this time.

One by one, cool kisses rained down on her forehead, eyes, nose, and her lips…

She didn’t feel the disgust and dirtiness she usually felt, but instead, felt like she was treated like the most precious thing in the world.

Who… was he…

Ah, that hurt…

Why did he bite her?

As much as Lu Tingxiao was trying to restrain himself, he finally couldn’t resist and walked into her room. Although he knew that he shouldn’t wake her, his actions had unconsciously taken on a ruthless tint.

This woman… could always push him to lose control so easily!

‘If I meet a good-looking guy who fits my type, I might even bring him over for the night…’, that phrase was like a planet that had come crashing in at high speed, crushing his rationality into dust.

When his lips and tongue slid past the girl’s smooth and soft neck, he could no longer hold back the rising lust in his chest. He bit down fiercely, using the most primitive method to mark out his prey like a beast…

“Uh, that…”

In the instant that the smell of blood rose in the air, a girl’s weak voice resounded by his ears.

Lu Tingxiao’s back stiffened, and his entire person was frozen; as if someone had just taken a basin of cold water and poured it on him.

The man’s head was still buried in the hollow of her neck, the pain on her neck almost made Ning Xi scream out loud, but she could only bear with it. She awkwardly reminded: “Uh, that… I was only sleeping, but I wasn’t dead asleep… You… your actions were so… I couldn’t help but wake up…”

She had been planning to pretend to be asleep at first, but she couldn’t go on in the end. It was too painful!

At this moment, Lu Tingxiao’s unfathomable eyes had already melded with the dark of the night. He slowly raised his head, his gaze locked onto her as he held her chin with his finger. He stroked it gently, his tone like an incubus that had come from hell as he said, “Mm, so you woke up… So what?”

Just as he finished speaking, he pulled her hands above her head and pressed them down, before stooping down and kissing her lips without hesitation…
