“Darling, you haven’t been scared, right?” Ning Xi sent a worried glance at Xiao Bao (Little Treasure).

Little Treasure shook his head, holding onto her arm tightly. His face doesn’t look scared, but somehow seems depressed.

Why was he only five years old?

He really wants to grow up quickly. So that he can protect her, and not just look on from afar.

Lu Ting Xiao apparently sees through his son’s idea. This is your father’s job, don’t try to take it.

“Only a few people know that this is my address, who sent me a package hmm……” Ning Xi mumbles while picking up one of the boxes to see the sender. Unfortunately, the writing is too vague to see.

Lu Ting Xiao was just about to ask her if she needed a knife, but Ning Xi has skillfully torn open the package with her hand.

This is probably every girl’s essential skill.

After opening the outer layer of the package, Ning Xi saw an exquisite gift box. Lying in a bottle shape inside is a very nice perfume. Along with it, there is a very simple note: Happy Birthday.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Lu Ting Xiao from the rearview mirror sees that Ning Xi looks very happy: “A friend?”

Ning Xi carefully put the perfume back, and then began talking “It’s from my cousin. Did I tell you my uncle has one son and three daughters? The son is not his, and two of his daughters are from an illegitimate woman. Actually, my aunt only gave birth to one daughter, Ning Tianxin.

Lu Ting Xiao looks slightly calmer. It’s originally from a cousin. A cousin is good.

Ning Xi showed an expression of nostalgia, “In the Ning family, Tianxin is the only who was good to me, although her personality is a little distant. Unfortunately, at the beginning because she looked a little cold I didn’t get close to her. But she was determined to remind me several times to pay attention to Ning Xuelo. I didn’t take it to heart………”

“Speaking of my sister’s character, you’re actually quite similar. Even though the appearance looks very cold, it’s in fact very good. (I think the author is referring to her cousin as elder sister)

Lu Ting Xiao: “……….” He was boasted about. But he doesn’t know if he should be happy or not. Can this be considered the legendary good card? (basically being given the “good guy card” i.e. the friend zone”)

Ning Xi finished with the first package, then continued to the second one. The writing on this one is not fuzzy, but there is simply not a sender written in.

“An anonymous package hmm…… I have recently been hacked badly, this time I shouldn’t be demolished by an anonymous package?” Ning XI said as she shook the box. There’s no sound at all inside, she can’t hear anything ****.

“I’ll help you with the demolition.” From the driver’s seat, Lu Ting Xiao reaches his hand out.

“What?” Ning XI was about to say how will you drive and help me dismantle the box but sees that Lu Ting Xiao’s hand has left the steering wheel, but the car is still driving smoothly. Even in front of an intersection and when he turns a bend.

Ning Xi is just watching amazed. “How is it………this car is?”

Lu Ting Xiao indifferently replied, “I made some changes to the system.”

Ning Xi: “…………” Although unmanned vehicles are rare, but not surprising. You changed it yourself?

At this time, she discovered that although the car is a very popular mid-range car similar to hundreds of thousands of cars, the interior and the construction is not the same.

Lu Ting Xiao didn’t just borrow the car shell, he changed the entire interior too. On the seat under her butt, this isn’t quality leather, right? This metal handrail that looks so shiny and good is not some high-tech material right.

Hanging in the front is a beautiful jade that is so crystal clear, it can’t be….it needs to be ice………she didn’t dare continue to think about it……

Ning Xi finally recovered, and then nervously reminded Lu Ting Xiao in the front “Lu Ting Xiao, you need to be careful! In case that package really…….” Her voice faded away as a “Bang” sounded……
