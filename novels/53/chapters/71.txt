Chapter 72: You’re Completely Oppressed By Me

Ning Xi was the first to come out after changing into costume.

She was neatly dressed like a young man in an outfit that alternated between red and white. Her hair was tied back in a handsome high ponytail, her eyebrows were dark and arched, and she had a threatening heroic spirit. She looked exactly like a 16-year-old Meng Changge.

Even those people who had always been biased against Ning Xi couldn’t help but admit that she looked perfect for the role.

At first, Guo Qisheng had been worried that an extremely beautiful female actress like Ning Xi would only be able to act a particular type of role. He didn’t expect that she would actually be this malleable. He praised her with satisfaction and then warned her anxiously, “Ning Xi, in a moment, you need to let loose a little. Don’t be too concerned about your appearance, okay? For this scene, you need to act like a ruffian. The wilder the better!”

“Director, you can relax. I believe she can do it!” By this time, Jiang Muye had also finished changing into costume and had just walked out of the dressing room.

The moment Jiang Muye pushed aside the curtains and walked out, the set immediately burst out in gasps of astonishment, and even Ning Xi raised her eyebrows in surprise.

After getting into costume, Jiang Muye’s entire temperament had changed. Wearing a cyan robe with bamboo prints, his face was like jade and his eyebrows were warm and kind. It seemed as if he had walked out of an old painting.

Jiang Muye proudly shot a glance at the stunned Ning Xi. He whispered, “What do you think? Aren’t the heavens crying from my handsomeness??”

It was a pity the image was ruined the moment he opened his mouth…

Ning Xi maintained a modest expression, as if she was discussing the plot with Jiang Muye. She spoke three words,

“Submissive and weak.”

“You…”

“Me? What about me? I’m sorry to inform you, but in this story you’re completely. Oppressed. By. Me!

“Oh yeah? Then why do I recall a scene where I counterattack? It even seems to be a bed scene. Tsk tsk……”

……

Not far away, Jia Qingqing watched the two people who were sticking their heads close together and whispering into each other’s ears from time to time. She was so jealous she was about to lose her rational mind.

Ever since he had arrived, Jiang Muye had given all his attention to Ning Xi. He hadn’t even so much as glanced in her direction. She didn’t even have an opportunity to greet him.

By her side, Ning Xueluo was continuously ‘comforting’ her. “Qingqing, don’t get angry. Things have already become like this. After all, in the entertainment industry, luck is also a part of one’s strength. Ning Xi had the good luck to get Jiang Muye as her acting partner. I’m guessing that after this movie, she’ll be able to enter the ranks of second tier actors. There’s even a chance that she could get into the first tier…”

“Hah, even the first tier? She dared to steal my possessions, did you think I would let her have an easy time?” Jia Qingqing’s originally pretty face was now exceptionally twisted with malice.

“Qingqing, don’t be too impulsive. The company is preparing to invest a lot of effort into developing Ning Xi. If you tangle with her now, I’m afraid…”

“So what if I tangle with her? Don’t tell me you’re scared of a man-eating vixen like her!”

Upon hearing that the company was preparing to develop Ning Xi, Jia Qingqing was even more furious. After all, the type of movies she acted in were similar to Ning Xi’s. If the company elevated Ning Xi, there was a large likelihood that a portion of her own resources would be taken away.

Watching Jia Qingqing become completely fired up, Ning Xueluo secretly smiled.

With Jia Qingqing as a knife, she didn’t have to use her own hands at all. All she needed to do was sit back and enjoy the show.

However, Ning Xi’s luck did seem to be running a little too well recently. Some precautions needed to be taken…

“Where’s Xiao Cui? Have the props been prepared?” Guo Qisheng shouted.

“Coming, coming. Director, will this do?” The prop master brought a hemp rope over.

“Yes!” Guo Qisheng nodded and then called to Jiang Muye, “Muye, I’ll have to inconvenience you a bit!”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It’s no inconvenience. This is necessary for filming the scene!” Jiang Muye looked dedicated to his work as he laid down on a large carved bed with ease, allowing the prop master to bind his arms and legs.

That’s right. As the director had mentioned, this scene was… very intense…

After Meng Changge’s confession to Sun Huanqing had been met with rejection, she had immediately kidnapped him and brought him home….
