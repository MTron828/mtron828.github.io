Chapter 2118: Sister-in-law Doesn’t Trust Me?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi stayed by Little Treasure’s side for the whole night.

The next day, Ning Xi suddenly opened her eyes and realized that she had fallen asleep. She quickly went over to Little Treasure and asked, “How’s Little Treasure?”

“Don’t worry. The fever’s gone already,” Lu Tingxiao said.

Ning Xi was relieved. “That’s great.”

Lu Tingxiao’s eyes darkened. While he seemed to be thinking about something, he comforted Ning Xi with a relaxed expression, “You’re being too anxious about it.”

Ning Xi nodded. “I guess so…”

She felt too pressured with so much to consider about.

Little Treasure did not seem to be very energetic even after his fever went down. Thankfully, the fever did not come back and things were fine for two days.

However, Little Treasure’s condition unexpectedly worsened on the third day.

While he did not have a temperature, he fell unconscious and his body was really weak.

Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao quickly sent him to the Imperial Military Hospital that night.

The results of the second full body checkup still showed no sign of illness.

Ning Xi’s hand trembled when she took out her phone as she looked at Little Treasure hooked up to a ventilator. “Let me ask Annie to take a look at him!”

She thought it was just a normal fever and did not expect things to turn out this way.

As Ning Xi was about to make a call by the door, there was a voice behind her. “The brat is sick?”

“Yun Shen…” Ning Xi was surprised to see who it was.

The man looked as arrogant as usual. He had a black shirt on; the contrast made his fine skin appear even whiter than usual.

When he saw Ning Xi’s surprised expression, the man raised up his right middle finger which was bandaged. “I got injured by a needle. Annie wasn’t around and Ye forced me to come to the hospital!”

He sounded aggrieved.

Not just Tang Ye and Feng Xiaoxiao, even Tang Lang was there as well. Ever since Yun Shen and Lu Tingxiao ceased their war, Tang Lang had been hanging out with Tang Ye.

Tang Ye had his usual stoic glasses on.

Feng Xiaoxiao and Tang Lang crossed their arms and just stood there, their mouths twitching.

Ignoring the fact that he was suddenly injured by a mere needle, why did he sounded so aggrieved?He had a medical condition whereby he would profusely bleed if he was injured!

“Hmm? Little Treasure is sick?” Feng Xiaoxiao took a peek into the room.

“What happened? Hasn’t Little Treasure’s fever come down yet?” Tang Lang asked.

Ning Xi did not look well as she shook her head. “At first, the fever didn’t go down. It finally went away two days ago, but now he’s suddenly fallen unconscious. The body checkups showed nothing odd. I was about to call Annie over to take a look at Little Treasure…”

Yun Shen glanced over at the little bun. He narrowed his eyes and mumbled, “This condition… seems familiar…”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“What?” Ning Xi suddenly became nervous. “You’ve seen it before? Where?”

“I have to take a look at the brat to confirm,” Yun Shen said.

Ning Xi frowned, apparently not very trusting of this guy. She never heard of him knowing about illnesses.

“Seems like Sister-in-law doesn’t trust me? Fine then…”

Suddenly, Lu Tingxiao said, “It’s alright. Let him take a look.”

Ning Xi then nodded with ease. “Oh, go ahead then!”

Yun Shen was speechless. He suddenly did not feel like helping anymore!
