Chapter 149: A Precise Kabedon Position

Seeing that the girl was taking the initiative to reach out to him with open arms for the first time, emotion rippled in the cold depths of Lu Tingxiao’s eyes.

“AHHH! They’re coming! Lu Tingxiao, hurry up!” Ning Xi had already somehow thrown herself onto him in a mess of motion.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

As expected, once she was stuck onto Lu Tingxiao, the robots didn’t dare to touch her.

How magical!

After that warm, soft and fragrant body had just abruptly clung onto him, Lu Tingxiao had a lapse in concentration before he could react. He leaned over to pick her up by the waist, before walking towards the spiral stairs step by step.

This was probably the first time she had been so close to him while she was sober and awake.

He really hoped that this walk would never end…

If Lu Jingli knew what his brother was thinking right now… Uh…

The robots followed behind as Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi headed upstairs, maintaining a certain distance between them.

To keep her balance, Ning Xi’s arms were wrapped around his neck. Breathing in Lu Tingxiao’s chilly yet aromatic scent, looking at the large group of robots following behind as they ascended a set of spiral stairs, she somehow felt that this scene was super romantic!

However, this rose-coloured bubble didn’t last for long.

Just as they had reached the top floor without a hitch and were preparing to open that silvery white door, the robots behind them made clacking noises and stretched their metal arms towards them. While their arms were moving, a launch tunnel that looked like a gun came out from within their arms.

Ning Xi abruptly turned pale with fright, “Crap! Are those real? I thought they were just toys!”

Was it really good to give a five year old kid such dangerous and lethal things?

She really didn’t know how to criticise Lu Tingxiao’s child-raising methods anymore.

“What do we do now?” Ning Xi was on the verge of tears.

They were only here to find Little Treasure, why did they have to go through so many trials and tribulations? It was like they were going through a dungeon in a game.

Lu Tingxiao held onto her shoulders and pushed her to the door panel behind them. Following that, he used his whole body to cover her, while he placed one arm on the door behind her.

Ning Xi stayed silent for three seconds before swallowing her saliva and saying slowly: “Big Boss… do you know that you just did an extremely precise kabedon position?”

“Kerby dawn?” This was clearly another term that Lu Tingxiao didn’t understand.

Ning Xi facepalmed. Flirting without meaning to is the most dangerous thing to do, my dear!

It was at this moment that Ning Xi spotted something from the corner of her eyes: a robot had actually aimed at Lu Tingxiao’s back and fired a shot, “Lu Tingxiao! Watch out!”

However, it was too late. Lu Tingxiao covered her tightly and let out a muffled grunt.

“Lu Tingxiao——” Ning Xi was in a complete panic.

“I’m fine.” Lu Tingxiao slowly raised his head.

“How could you be fine! Lu Tingxiao, are you okay? I’ll send you to… Urk…” While in the middle of speaking, Ning Xi felt her stomach churning, “Lu Tingxiao, you’re really stinky… What’s so smelly?”

Lu Tingxiao took off his jacket with a dark expression. A sticky, disgusting-looking object was stuck on the back of his jacket.

Ning Xi covered her nose. While relaxing because he was fine, she spoke with a speechless expression, “What is this? It can’t be poop, right?”

Lu Tingxiao tossed his jacket to the floor below and said expressionlessly, “Surströmming. It’s said to be the world’s smelliest canned food, it was Lu Jingli’s idea.”

The corner of Ning Xi’s mouth twitched, “Second Young Master really has the brightest ideas… It’s not just smelly, it’s practically a biochemical weapon!”

Just as she finished speaking, the door behind her suddenly opened towards them by itself…

TL Note: A summary of this chapter: robots, kabedon and Surströmming… Only in HM!

Kabedon… Kabedon can only be explained through a pic:

Kabedon is a Japanese word that is pronounced like ‘car-bay-dawn’. In the original Chinese text, Lu Tingxiao said something with the same pronunciation, but a totally different meaning. To get the same effect, I used ‘kerby dawn’. I hope that got through to you guys! ????

Surströmming is basically Swedish fermented fish in a can, also known as the world’s smelliest food (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surstr%C3%B6mming).
