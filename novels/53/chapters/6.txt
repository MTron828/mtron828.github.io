Chapter 7: Big Bun Wants to Repay with His Body

Lu Tingxiao sized up the woman on the bed probingly, as if he was trying to tell if the expression of surprise on her face was real.

After a long while, it seemed as if he finally believed that she had not known of Little Treasure’s identity. He then spoke up coolly, “Your request.”

“Uh, what request?” Ning Xi did not understand the words that had appeared out of nowhere.

“My brother wants to thank you for saving Little Treasure, he’s asking you to state your request!” Lu Jingli had the expression ‘you struck gold this time’ written all over his face.

Hearing this, the gears in Ning Xi’s head spun quickly as she cautiously said, “You really don’t need to thank me. It’s true that I saved Little Treasure, but he also saved me. If it weren’t for Little Treasure going out to call for help, then I would still be shut in there right now, so we can be considered even.”

Although she was really lucky to have saved the little prince, how could she dare to claim a reward for it? The more money someone had, the more prone they were to paranoid delusions of being schemed against. Furthermore, this was the super rich, top-class elite Lu family they were talking about, it was already amazing that they were not suspecting her of directing the whole incident. Didn’t you see how warily Lu Tingxiao had been looking at her just now?

To avoid extra suffering later on, it was best to even out the relations between them.

Ning Xi had thought that there was no issue with her answer, but Lu Tingxiao’s expression remained displeased, causing a burst of fright in her heart.

Did she say something wrong? Why was his expression so scary?

“Brother, don’t put on such a scary expression! We know you’re trying to repay a debt of gratitude, but those who know nothing about the situation will think you’re trying to take revenge!” Lu Jingli could not bear seeing a beauty suffering fright, so he spoke up to break the ice. He then turned to Ning Xi and said, “My brother doesn’t like to owe others, you should just request something! No need to be polite!”

There were even people that would force others into bringing up a request?

The corner of her mouth twitched, “It’s not that I’m being polite, you really don’t need to repay me. What I said was the truth, if you don’t believe me, you can go check…”

“No need.” Lu Tingxiao spoke simply and to the point. His face was starting to show hints of impatience.

Lu Jingli spoke up, “There was surveillance footage of the bar’s storeroom. I’ve already seen it, Little Treasure ran in on his own. As for you, the manager of the bar has already admitted that she was the one who locked you in, so you don’t need to worry, we don’t suspect your intentions. Since you did save Little Treasure, just ask for something!”

Great, we’re right back where we started!

In the end, Ning Xi had no other choice. Under Lu Tingxiao’s increasingly forceful gaze, she summoned up her courage to say, “Then… how about you give me money?”

The rich like to resolve debts in this simple and straightforward manner right?

Lu Tingxiao should also be the type to like solving problems with money!

If she didn’t ask for money, then wouldn’t they think that she was eyeing something else? If not money, then people?

Just as Ning Xi was assured that this was the most appropiate request she could put forward, Lu Tingxiao’s expression became even uglier.

Ning Xi was on the verge of tears. Why did he have to be so taciturn? If you have something to say, just say it out! Would speaking a few more words kill you?

Lu Jingli, the translating machine, rubbed his nose, “My brother thinks that just giving you money would be too insulting.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ning Xi was howling in her heart: It’s okay!! Just insult me!!!!

The Lu family’s status was too special and she just could not think of an appropriate request at the moment. Just as they were about to come to a deadlock, Lu Tingxiao spoke up——

“Marry me.”

Ning Xi went completely lifeless for a second, before coughing fiercely, almost choking to death on her own spit, “Cough cough cough……what did you say?”

After finally managing to stop her coughing, she hurriedly turned towards Lu Jingli with intensity.

Second Young Master, please translate!!!

However, this time it was not only Ning Xi, but also Lu Jingli who was completely dazed. “Brother, what do you mean? I can’t even translate for you this time!”

At this moment, good fortune arrived and a lightbulb went off in Ning Xi’s head. She said falteringly, “Don’t tell me you’ve decided to repay me with your body because I saved your son?”

Lu Tingxiao inclined his head slightly. After slight thought, he nodded, “You could put it that way.”
