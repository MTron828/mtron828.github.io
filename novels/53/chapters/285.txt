Chapter 286: Always Been This Quick-Witted

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Dr. Qin says he has slight depression,” said Lu Jingli with a heavy tone.

“Depression? Why does he suddenly have depression? How is he now?”

For the past few days since she hadn’t heard any news from the Lu family, she thought that the best news was no news. She thought Little Treasure had entirely healed under her care. Based on what she knew about his reactions, he could really have kicked up a fuss. Had Lu Jingli and the rest sought her earlier, it might not have been like this…

“Now his condition is getting worse, even when we’ve had many doctors over. It’s all not working, Xiao Xi Xi, you have to come visit Little Treasure quickly!”

“Where is Little Treasure now?”

“At the old residence, where my parents live!”

Ning Xi’s end of the line was silent for a few seconds, and then there was a slight shift in her tone, “Lu Jingli, you’re hiding something from me.”

“What? No…No, I’m not! What would I hide from you?”

“Little Treasure has already been ill for a few days now, logically you would have called for me earlier, at the very least, a call, but you didn’t. Not until now, when it’s already so late at night, that you’re rushing for me to come over. Plus, Little Treasure is still at the old residence…” Ning Xi paused, before she continued, “Father and Mother Lu, they found out about my identity, didn’t they? They’re against me and Lu Tingxiao getting together, and they don’t let me go near Little Treasure anymore, right?”

“Uhh…well…” Lu Jingli was used to being the one who guessed everything correctly. This was his first time being exposed with no way to hide. He suddenly turned sour and grumbled, “Xiao Xi Xi, since when did you become this quick-witted?”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hey! I’ve always been this quick-witted!” Ning Xi rolled her eyes, frowned and asked with a tired tone, “Second master, you know how Lu Tingxiao and I are like now. If I go over it wouldn’t be appropriate, what more with your parents’ opinion of me now.

“I promised Lu Tingxiao I would take care of Little Treasure, and actually…tomorrow will be the final day of the contract. I would have to leave eventually.

“Even if I went right now, what about next time, and the next time?

“Little Treasure has the best doctors, his grandfather and his grandmother, and you guys to take care of him. I believe that as the days go by, he will soon forget all about me…”

Ning Xi said all of this in a single breath, not knowing whether she said those for Lu Jingli or for herself.

Of course she was worried about Little Treasure, but if she visited him now, she was almost sure that she would give in the moment she saw Little Treasure, to the point that she might even agree to all of his requests…

She had already persevered for so many days, she could not just give up now.

“But, sister-in-law, a heart’s troubles can only be cured by resolving it. Little Treasure’s illness happened because he misses you too much. Every day, he looks forward for your return, do you really have the heart to…hello…hello…”

The line went dead, and Lu Jingli was suddenly at a loss.

Damn it, I have actually failed!

Seems like Xiao Xi Xi had really hardened her resolve this time.

What do I do now? My poor baby!

Lu Jingli had no choice but to report the situation to his brother.

After searching everywhere, he finally found him in Little Treasure’s room.

Lu Tingxiao sat at the bedside while Little Treasure laid on his bed with his eyes close, unsure if he was asleep as the little guy had been having trouble sleeping lately.

Lu Tingxiao only needed to see Lu Jingli’s expression to know the outcome. He replied in an expectant tone, “She rejected, didn’t she?”
