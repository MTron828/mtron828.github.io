Chapter 54: Calling His Sister-in-law

The morning of the next day.

After Ning Xi left, Lu Tingxiao couldn’t stop worrying and called Lu Jingli.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Send someone to watch the set.”

“Bro, are you worried that someone’s going to bully sister-in-law? Actually, these are all things that one must experience on the road to becoming famous, it’s good for her to get used to it! If she doesn’t face these obstacles, how else is she going to stand on her own!” Lu Jingli copied the tone that Lu Tingxiao usually took when lecturing him.

Lu Tingxiao: “She doesn’t need it.” The meaning in his words, was that he was there to protect her.

Lu Jingli: “…” Heh heh.

A desolate wind blew in Lu Jingli’s heart from his own brother’s biased treatment.

He thought in his heart, that wasn’t what you said back when you threw me into that shithole Golden Age without saying a word and preventing anyone from helping me!

“Fine fine fine. I’ll send someone to watch the set! I’ll make sure she won’t miss even a single strand of hair!”

“I’ll give you a week’s holiday for next week.” Lu Tingxiao suddenly said.

“What… Bro, what did you say?” Lu Jingli thought he had hallucinated, “You’re actually giving me a holiday, and it’s a whole week! You haven’t let me take a break for the past three years!”

“You don’t want it?”

“I do, I do, I do! Of course I do! But… why are you suddenly treating me so well?” Lu Jingli couldn’t understand no matter how hard he thought. He recalled the words he had said earlier.

Finally, he felt that the issue had come from something he had said at the start: sister-in-law.

He got a break just because he had called Ning Xi sister-in-law?

This break was making him both happy and sad…

“Eldest Young Master, Dr Qin is here.” A maid reported from outside the study.

A lanky man stood beside the maid, dressed in casual clothes. His appearance was warm and kindly, and his smile was like a refreshing breeze, he looked very friendly.

Lu Tingxiao hung up and turned towards the arrival, “You’ve come, please take a seat.”

Qin Mufeng set down the bag in his hands and sat on the sofa, “What happened? How’s Little Treasure’s condition?”

“You can see for yourself, he’s in the kitchen.” Lu Tingxiao replied.

“The kitchen?” Qin Mufeng raised an eyebrow, then stood up to stride to the kitchen.

After just a moment, Qin Mufeng was back, and he smiled, “When did Little Treasure pick up the hobby of making fruit juice? And I see that he seems to be in good spirits! Did something happen?”

“Something did happen recently. A few days ago, I was too busy at work and I wasn’t able to take care of Little Treasure, so Jingli secretly took him to a bar…”

Lu Tingxiao explained everything to him simply.

Qin Mufeng’s expression kept changing as he listened, before he finally said happily, “At least it was a blessing in disguise for Little Treasure! I’ve said this before, Little Treasure is currently too lifeless. If there were some driving force that could make him feel interest in life, then it would help his recovery greatly. Furthermore, this is a living person! You didn’t keep the girl as a nanny or home tutor for Little Treasure?”

Lu Tingxiao: “She’s going to be Little Treasure’s mother in the future.”

Qin Mufeng coughed three times in succession. He looked at Lu Tingxiao’s expressionless face in surprise, “What did you say? Are you doing it for Little Treasure, or for yourself…”

Lu Tingxiao’s chilly expression seemed to have melted. He looked out the window, and said slowly, “Dr Qin, I think your previous verdict was right.”

“Have you… fallen in love with this girl?” Qin Mufeng was extremely agitated upon hearing so, “I knew it, my verdict couldn’t be wrong. How could you be asexual! Quick, tell me what the situation is. Does your heart beat faster, does your blood boil, do you want to get closer to her, do you want to make love to her?”

Lu Tingxiao lowered his gaze and thought about it seriously for a while, then nodded, “You’re basically right!”
