Chapter 165: You Deserve to Be Called the Great Demon King

Following that, Ning Xi opened up her Weibo only to see her entire screen covered in abuse. This time, it was several times worse than the incident with Jia Qingqing. After all, Ning Xueluo was much more popular than Jia Qingqing and her fans were more formidable.

[That bitch Ning Xi has been hiding from the public eye for so long, she’s definitely feeling guilty! She couldn’t possibly have run away after seeing how her plot was exposed, right? After all, she could be charged with attempted murder this time around! If they file a lawsuit, she’s definitely going to jail!]

[She might have gotten trashed the first time because of someone else’s jealousy, but with incidents like this happening so often, it’s a sure sign that there’s something wrong with her character! Not to mention, she was caught with evidence this time!]

[Ning Xueluo is famous for being a good person within the entertainment industry. She even repeatedly stood up for Ning Xi as her senior. I really didn’t expect Ning Xi to bite the hand that feeds her and commit such a low crime! It’s all thanks to people like her that the entertainment industry is becoming more corrupt!]

[Don’t you guys feel like everything was planned by Ning Xi? First, she got rid of Jia Qingqing to secure her position as the second female lead, and now she’s plotting to bring down Ning Xueluo so that she can take the role of the first female lead!]

[It’s extremely frightening once you think about it. She’s too scary! As expected, all beautiful women are bad news!]

……

Lu Tingxiao frowned when he caught sight of the malicious comments on her phone. His brows drew together as he spoke, “Stop reading them.”

Sitting cross-legged with a thermometer in her mouth, Ning Xi gave a muffled response, “It’s fine. Reading these is actually pretty fun!”

“Focus on measuring your temperature. Stop speaking.”

“Oh.” You were the one who started talking to me…

When the measurement was done, Lu Tingxiao looked at the thermometer, “37.1 degrees.”

Pleased, Ning Xi immediately said, “Didn’t I say that I was fine? In fact, I’m in great health! Can I leave the hospital now?”

“Stay a few more days for observation.”

“Ah? I still have to stay?! But I miss Darling Little Treasure!” Ning Xi brought up Little Treasure in a desperate measure.

“He’s already on the way over.” Lu Tingxiao’s tone didn’t allow for any leeway.

“Uh, alright then…” Ning Xi was finally speechless.

Lu Tingxiao put away the dining tray and then sat down on a chair by the bed, “What are you planning to do next?”

Ning Xi suddenly recalled something, “I was just about to ask you that. Could you send a copy of the evidence to my phone? I’m going to forward it to someone!”

Lu Tingxiao shot her a glance, “Zhang Qiang?”

Even though Ning Xi was already used to Lu Tingxiao’s killer IQ, she still couldn’t help but feel impressed, “You deserve to be called Big Boss! You’re too smart! I’m planning to let these two dogs bite each other by making Zhang Qiang extort money from Ning Xueluo with the evidence we found!”

Ning Xi coughed dryly after she finished speaking in excitement. She looked rather uneasily at Lu Tingxiao, “Am I being too… malicious?”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Lu Tingxiao didn’t respond to her question. Instead, he replied with his analysis, “The main issue with this method is that there’s nothing in it for you and it lets Zhang Qiang off the hook too easily.”

Ning Xi scratched her head, “You’re right, but my goal is to mess with Ning Xueluo. I didn’t really give much thought to anything else.”

After contemplating for a moment, Lu Tingxiao spoke, “Why don’t you extort her yourself instead of letting Zhang Qiang reap the benefits?”

Ning Xi’s eyes almost popped out from astonishment upon hearing that, “Is… Is that okay?”

“Why not?” Lu Tingxiao answered her question with one of his own. He immediately continued his analysis, “Going by Ning Xueluo’s finances, you can probably ask her for about 8 million. This is the best opportunity for you to cancel your contract with Starlight and you can use that money to pay off the penalty fee.”

“…” After listening to Lu Tingxiao, Ning Xi couldn’t find any words to speak.

She had only wanted to incite others at most, but this great demon king was really something else. Not only was he looking down on her actions, he actually started teaching her how to be even more evil…
