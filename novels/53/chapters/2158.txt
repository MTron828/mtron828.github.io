A dead silence rang in the room as Mo Lingtian gave his answer and everyone looked over at him.

His tone was extremely certain.

Lu Jingli was worried. “Bro Tian! Are you sure?! Don’t just give a random answer! Who’s Zero? What’s Prison Cage? I’ve never even heard of it before!”

Qin Mufeng looked at Mo Lingtian with a complicated expression. “I’ve never heard Tianxin mention it either.”

“Lucky bastard! You’re right!” Feng Xiaoxiao clenched her teeth again as she looked at the answer on the scrap of paper.

“What?! That’s correct? How did you do that? Do you really know how to read minds?” Tang Lang was impressed.

Mo Lingtian’s eyes looked at the girl at the opposite and he did not say anything.

Lu Jingli and Jiang Muye, who knew about their relationship, studied him oddly. Qin Mufeng frowned slightly.

Lu Tingxiao glanced over at Mo Lingtian too, but he was not surprised. He turned to Feng Xiaoxiao and asked, “What’s the second level?”

Feng Xiaoxiao suddenly got excited. She touched her chin and scanned all the men with a lascivious smile.

“Hehehe, the second level… Pick anyone from your group and wear a female outfit. You’ll pass if all of us agree that the person is pretty!”

Suddenly, everyone set their eyes onto… Jiang Muye.

Jiang Muye had been dragged over by Lu Jingli. He just wanted to stay in a corner but who knew that he would be involved in such a way!?

“Hey! Why are you guys looking at me? Don’t even think about it!” Jiang Muye felt so uncomfortable when everyone was staring at him.

“You’re one of us! Time for you to contribute!” Lu Jingli said.

Tang Lang went along as well. “It’s just acting like a girl! How easy! It’s not your first time anyway!”

Jiang Muye’s expression darkened. “If it’s so easy, then you guys do it!”

“The problem is that we need to impress the girls. That’s very difficult. Only you can do it!”

“Flattery doesn’t work on me!”

Lu Tingxiao then said, “I’ll owe you one.”

Jiang Muye’s eyes brightened. “Really? Anything?”

“Yes.”

It took three seconds for Jiang Muye to change his stance. “Deal!”

Having Lu Tingxiao owe him one would mean he could avoid his mother forcing him to get married!

After some time, Jiang Muye finally came back.

“Ah! So beautiful!”

“Oh my God, how pretty!”

“I don’t have any more regrets now!”

While it was a big sacrifice, he did get very excellent feedback. All the girls were satisfied.

Even the picky Feng Xiaoxiao had nothing to complain about. “That’s unfair! You look even better than me!”

“Is that enough? Did we pass?” Jiang Muye was annoyed.

Feng Xiaoxiao waved her hand. “Pass!”

Only the last level was left.

The men looked at each other and thought that the last level was going to be extremely difficult.
