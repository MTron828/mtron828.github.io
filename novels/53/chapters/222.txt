Chapter 223: Couldn’t Tell The Dogs From People

Translator: Henyee  Editor: Henyee

Jiang Muye had lost this round completely.

Strictly speaking, he was the one who had started the war, but he had stepped on a mine himself, and couldn’t take another step…

The enemy was brutal!

Ning Xi couldn’t believe it. “I never expected that someone like Sister Zhizhi can also be blind at times!”

Jiang Muye glared at her: “Watch your mouth! What blind? You are the blind one! You even liked trash like Su Yan!”

Ning Xi sighed. “Ai, just blame it on us being young and naive, we couldn’t tell the dogs from people!”

“You…” Jiang Muye was so angry that he couldn’t continue, then in the end exploded. “Now do you know how evil and scheming Lu Tingxiao is? He used such a shameless trick to stop me!”

After saying that, he thought he would see regret on Ning Xi’s face, but instead, he saw her act all silly and infatuated —

“Lord Boss really is so wise and such a strategist, always prepared and able to plan victories from a thousand miles away…”

Jiang Muye’s face was as black as the bottom of a pan. “Ning Xi, there is no hope for you anymore!”

Ning Xi suddenly moved closer, a cheeky expression on her face. “Hey, what happened between you and Sister Zhizhi? Looking at your face, it doesn’t seem something as simple as an ex-girlfriend!”

Jiang Muye this guy wouldn’t be this apprehensive over something as trifling as an ex-girlfriend.

“Mind your own business first!” Jiang Muye wasn’t in a good mood, and asked hesitantly, “What did you guys talk about just now?”

Ning Xi shrugged. “Not much, she let me know the writer is revising the script, and filming will resume in half a month.”

“Brother Ming told me the same, there’ll be more emphasis on Meng Changge and Sun Huanqing’s story after the rewrite. As for Ning Xueluo and Zhao Sizhou, it’s not clear yet whether they will be replaced, but since Lu Tingxiao cares about you so much, I bet he’ll definitely get rid of them!”Jiang Muye analyzed the situation.

Ning Xi shook her head. “Wrong, if Lu Tingxiao really knows the way I think, he definitely won’t have anyone replaced. Because, using my strength to thoroughly defeat Ning Xueluo in the movie, and reducing her to nothing more than a foil for my role, for me, is the best way to get revenge!”

After saying this, Ning Xi’s phone beeped with a notification for the latest entertainment news.

She subscribed to some important entertainment news sites, and each time, the latest news would pop up themselves.

The corners of Ning Xi’s mouth couldn’t help turning up after she read it; she looked simply like a silly girl in love…

Terrified by the expression on her face, Jiang Muye drew closer warily to take a look —

It was Glory World’s latest announcement: Lu Corporation had stepped in to replace the investments withdrawn by Ning International and Starlight Entertainment. The <The World> project now belonged to Glory World completely. Out of consideration for the shooting schedule, none of the cast would be replaced…VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Jiang Muye felt suffocated by the tacit understanding which Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi shared. “It looks like you’ve been completely ensnared, and you don’t even know it. You like Lu Tingxiao this much… can you really endure not being with him?”

Ning Xi laid down on the grass and plucked a piece of bristlegrass and stuck it between her lips. “Who said that if you like someone you need to be with that person? Is it any less than the people who get together because they like each other? How many of them really last? This…this is already good enough…”

The best-case scenario was them becoming good friends and confidantes. But even if the worst-case scenario came to pass, forgetting with the flow of time wasn’t a bad thing; the memories would then remain forever in a time when they were the most beautiful.
