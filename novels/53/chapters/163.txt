Chapter 164: Do You Have the Strength To Eat?

“You’ve woken up.” Lu Tingxiao was afraid of startling her, so he walked over with light steps. He patted her gently on the head with his large palm.

“Lu Tingxiao…” Ning Xi’s response was a little slow as she looked at him.

“Yes, how do you feel?”

Ning Xi was bewildered, “Is this the hospital? What happened to me?”

“You fainted yesterday with a fever of 39 degrees.” Upon thinking back to how she had suddenly collapsed yesterday, Lu Tingxiao couldn’t control his darkening expression.

Ning Xi scratched her head, “I was having a fever? Why can’t I feel any strength in my body now?”

“That must be from hunger. You’ve already slept for almost an entire day and night.” Lu Tingxiao helped her to set up the meal table before bringing a pillow for her back, “I guessed that you were about to wake up, so I bought you dinner.”

“Thank you…” Ning Xi looked at the man busying himself with setting up things and pursed her lips. She couldn’t resist reaching out to touch his chin.

The warmth from her fingertips made Lu Tingxiao startle. His gaze was warm as he looked at the girl, “Hm? Is something wrong?”

Ning Xi’s brows were furrowed together as she looked at his haggard appearance and the stubble on his chin, “Were you taking care of me the whole night? Even your stubble has grown out!”

“It’s fine, I slept for a bit.” Actually, he hadn’t closed his eyes for even a minute and hadn’t had the mood to clean up. It wasn’t until she had woken up that his heart had finally settled down.

“Eat. It’s not good for you to eat oily food right now, so I only got you some porridge. I’ll buy something tastier when you get well.” Lu Tingxiao passed the bowl of porridge and a spoon to her, “Do you have the strength to eat? Do you need me to help?”

Ning Xi didn’t make any sound or movement.

Lu Tingxiao raised his head to look at her in suspicion, “Is something the matter? Does it hurt anywhere? I’ll go call the doctor…”

Ning Xi hurriedly pulled him back, “Ay, I’m fine. I’m just not fully awake yet, I zoned out…”

Lu Tingxiao relaxed and said, “What you need now is plenty of rest, don’t let your thoughts run wild.”

“Okay.” Ning Xi nodded and focused on eating her porridge. However, she looked like she was miles away, like her mind had gone away on a journey.

Lu Tingxiao was treating her so well that she was terrified.

It wasn’t like she hadn’t noticed the way he treated her from the start. However, she had been ignoring it on purpose, and she even got used to it eventually.

Everything that the man before her had done… was it really just for the sake of repaying the debt of gratitude?

Even if he took her as a friend, who would go this far for their friends?

There were just way too many things she needed to take care of, so that thought simply flashed through her mind and disappeared…

After her meal, Ning Xi finally regained some of her energy.

She quickly banished the chaotic thoughts in her head and started to get down to business, “Lu Tingxiao, is my phone here?”

Lu Tingxiao showed his displeasure on his face, “I just said that you need to get plenty of rest.”

Ning Xi held her hands together in a begging gesture, “I’ve already rested enough by sleeping for so long, and I just ate my fill. If you don’t let me do something now, mold will start growing on me!”

Lu Tingxiao saw that she did look much better, and he couldn’t resist her puppy eyes, so he took out her phone and passed it to her.

Following that, he brought over the thermometer. “Measure your temperature.”

“Ah…” Ning Xi obediently opened up and held the thermometer in her mouth. She then opened a web page and started checking the latest entertainment news.

However, when she saw the latest headlines…
