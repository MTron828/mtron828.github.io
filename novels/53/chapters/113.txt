Chapter 114: I’m the One Forcefully Kissing You Anyway

Jiang Muye walked over to explain with considerably high spirits, “Didn’t Director Guo release some highlights of the film previously? One of the clips shown was the bondage scene we shot the other day. After that, they changed from anti-fans into your most fervent fans. Are they really that happy watching me get bullied?”

“Uh…” So that’s what happened.

Very few fans infatuated with celebrities would ever try to get in contact with their idols in real life, as their chances weren’t very high. Thus, movies and the like became the way fans lived their fantasies.

If a female star was going to act in a scene with your male idol, your first reaction might be a little jealousy. Especially if that female star acted terribly, you would feel that your idol had suffered injustice, thereby creating a lot of resistance. However, on the contrary, fans would also pretend to be the person acting alongside their idol and gain a lot of satisfaction from it.

That was Ning Xi’s current situation.

“Muye, Muye. I heard that you guys have a lot of intimate scenes. Is that true? Do you have any kissing scenes?” A fan asked excitedly.

Jiang Muye raised an eyebrow, “There is. In fact, we have one today.”

“AHHHHHH!” A wave of excited screaming rose from the fans.

“Can we watch? Can we? Can we?” The little girls asked while clamouring.

“The scene we’re filming today will be outdoors, so you should be able to see it from the fence. However, it’ll be pretty far away, so you might not be able to see clearly.” Jiang Muye replied.

“That’s fine, that’s fine, we all came prepared!” The girls all brought out the must-have item for fans: binoculars.

Ning Xi was speechless.

With so many people watching, the pressure was piling on top of her like a mountain!

In the break room.

Ning Xi couldn’t resist asking, “Speaking of the kissing scene, exactly which scene was it?” Too many things had happened recently and the order of filming had changed a lot. She only had a rough idea, but had not been informed of the specifics.

Jiang Muye flipped through the script excitedly, “It’s the scene with the flower lanterns, I asked the director last night.”

Ning Xi recalled the plot, “The flower lantern festival? Isn’t that the scene where Meng Changge and Sun Huanqing have their first kiss?”

“Yes, it’s that one!” After having said so, Jiang Muye’s eyebrows raised as he moved close to her cautiously and took a sniff, “Did you remember what I said yesterday? You didn’t eat anything you shouldn’t have, right?”

Ning Xi slapped him away, “Do I look that unprofessional to you?”

“Remember what you just said, if you play me, I’m going to tell the director!” Jiang Muye stared at her with distrust. He had been tricked too many times by this fellow, he completely didn’t dare to relax his guard.

Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him, “How old are you? Are you still going to tell the teacher! Aren’t you childish?”

Jiang Muye harrumphed and turned away, “I’m not going to talk to you anymore, I’m going to research how I’m going to act in the scene!”

Ning Xi turned his chair over in a single move, “What are you going to research for? Anyway, I’ll be the one forcefully kissing you by then! Come here, I have something to ask you!”

Jiang Muye: “…” Damn it, couldn’t he research how to get forcefully kissed then?

“What do you want to ask?” Jiang Muye asked huffily.

“What are they going to do with the Jia Qingqing’s role?”

“Of course they’re going to swap her out. I heard Ming-ge say that her replacement is going to be someone from our Golden Age Entertainment. It seems like it’ll be a new singer! She’s rather pretty, but she doesn’t have any acting experience at all, it’s going to be tough to watch! That’s right, did you hear about what happened to Jia Qingqing?”

“What about Jia Qingqing?” Ning Xi did not understand.

“What else could have happened? This incident got so out of hand that her sugar daddy’s wife found out. The wife hired people to strip Jia Qingqing on the streets and beat her up, then announced that she had to scram out of the capital or she would kill Jia Qingqing the next time they met! I was still worried that that woman would do something to you after getting forced into a corner, but it looks like I don’t have to worry anymore!” As Jiang Muye continued talking, he started to realise that something felt strange, “Ning Xi, why do I feel that everything happened way too smoothly?”

At this moment, the director’s voice sounded from outside——

“Ning Xi, Muye, go put on your costumes! It’ll be your turn for the next scene!”
