Chapter 121: Accidentally Barging Into a Party for the Rich?

“Is there any woman in the entire country who doesn’t want to sleep with Lu Tingxiao?” Ning Xi asked in response.

“Well, every woman in the entire country also wants to sleep with me, but you’ve never thought of sleeping with me!” Jiang Muye blurted out.

Ning Xi’s tone raised slightly as she questioned him, “How do you know that I’ve never wanted to sleep with you before?”

Jiang Muye froze. Immediately afterwards, his ears flushed red.

The next second, a stifled laugh escaped from Ning Xi.

Jiang Muye realized that he had been tricked and immediately flew into a humiliated rage, “Ning Xi! Just you wait! I’m not done with you yet!”

If he hadn’t been conscious of the other people in the room, he would have already started duking it out with her.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

When Ning Xi saw that she had finally pissed him off, she quickly waved goodbye and ran off to use the bathroom.

Ay, she had really drunk too much tonight. She liked to tease people whenever she drank a lot, and she enjoyed messing with Jiang Muye especially, that dork.

After settling her bodily needs, Ning Xi stumbled back in the direction she had come. The hotel’s hallways were twisting and turning in every direction. She searched for what seemed like half a day before finally finding the room.

However, she was stunned when she pushed the door open…

The room was full of strangers, and it was clearly much bigger and more lavish than the room the cast and crew had been in. It wouldn’t even be an over-exaggeration to say that the room dazzled with riches.

“Sorry, I’ve got the wrong room…”

Ning Xi made her apology and was just about to leave when a fat, greasy hand suddenly clamped around her wrist. Next, a mouth that smelled heavily of alcohol nearly touched her face, “Oh my, where did this lost little lamb come from? Since you’ve come here, it must be fate. Why don’t you stay here and have a drink with us?!”

The man who was holding onto her hand and refusing to let go looked to be roughly around 40 to 50 years old. His body was fat and his cheeks were flushed red. His eyes were filled with lust as he blatantly sized her up as if she wasn’t wearing anything. He looked her up and down and ultimately paused at her chest…

The room was immediately filled with rowdy shouts.

Ning Xi’s first instinct was to perform a shoulder throw, but when she inadvertently glanced across the room, she was surprised to see that there were many familiar faces that frequently appeared on finance magazines in this room. After taking a second look, holy crap, half of the top ten richest people in the capital were in this room…

The probability of this happening was about the same as a eunuch accidentally barging into the throne room in the middle of a morning assembly; and just as terrifying!

In short, there wasn’t a single person in this room that she could afford to offend, so Ning Xi immediately scrapped her idea of settling the issue with violence.

It looked like she wouldn’t be able to get away so easily tonight. This just had to happen while she was drunk and her head was spinning.

“Come come come… Pretty lady, come in quickly!” That fatty continued pulling her into the room. At the same time, he didn’t forget to take advantage of every part of her body.

After expending a great amount of effort, Ning Xi managed to throw off the fatty’s hand and politely said, “My apologies, mister. I really entered the wrong room. My friends are still waiting for me!”

When the fatty heard this, he immediately blew up, “You cheap slut! You clearly entered the wrong room on purpose. Why are you pretending to be innocent? You should thank your ancestors that I’ve taken an interest in you!”

Ning Xi cursed inwardly. Someone ranking in the top ten of the richest people in the capital had a character like this?

She recognised this fatty as the tenth person on that list. He was the chairman of the board of Crown Real Estate, Zhu Xiangcheng. He was an especially lecherous guy.

As he was speaking, the fatty reached out his hand to pull her again. Seeing that he was trying to drag her directly to the couch, Ning Xi was in the middle of wracking her brains to think up a way to escape when she suddenly felt a weight on her shoulder. An extremely cold and familiar aura that seemed as if it had come from a glacier appeared behind her, wrapping around her tightly…

Soon after, the gentle yet powerful force on her shoulder pulled her back a step. In the next second, she was wrapped up into a firm and warm embrace…
