Chapter 99: Smashing Windows in the Early Morning

In the middle of the night, at the PR department of Golden Age Entertainment Group.

Liang Feixing was currently hard pressed over Su Yimo’s drunk driving scandal where she had knocked over someone, when his personal phone suddenly rang.

He had been prepared to toss his phone to the side impatiently, but after seeing the display, he broke out into cold sweat and immediately sat up straight and hurriedly picked up the call——

“Hello, CEO Lu, sorry! We’re currently taking care of this matter. It’ll be settled by tomorrow night at the latest!”

“What matter?” The man’s cold and distant voice sounded from the phone.

“Ah? That is… Su Yimo’s drunk driving incident… You’re not looking for me because of that?” Liang Feixing was confused. So the boss hadn’t called this late at night to interrogate him about the matter?

“No.”

Liang Feixing immediately heaved a sigh of relief. His brain was fried from working too hard. CEO Lu had never interfered with Golden Age’s business. Even though this incident involved Golden Age’s top female actress, Su Yimo, and was a huge matter to them, it was most likely nothing in Lu Tingxiao’s eyes.

So why was the big boss looking for him at this time?

Liang Feixing started getting even more uneasy, “Then you’re looking for me for?”

“Get Jia Qingqing to retire from the entertainment circle in the next 24 hours.” Lu Tingxiao immediately set down an order.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Jia Qingqing? CEO Lu, which Jia Qingqing do you mean?”

“Starlight Entertainment.”

When the voice had finished speaking, Liang Feixing’s face was full of surprise. The Jia Qingqing whose looks were only above average, but had been billed as ‘The Entertainment Circle’s #1 Beauty’ by Starlight?

He had been wondering which big shot the boss had meant!

Liang Feixing’s face was full of bewilderment, but he didn’t dare to say another word. He agreed, “Got it, CEO Lu. I understand! As far as I know, Jia Qingqing has been having a catfight with one of the female artistes in the same company. Her opponent isn’t someone easy to deal with and has already collected a lot of blackmail material on Jia Qingqing. She even knows how to get someone else to do her dirty work. She handed over all the material to our company to create a scandal video. Jia Qingqing offended too many people, there are many people waiting to hit her once she’s down, I estimate that she won’t be able to escape so easily. However, we need a bigger fire to chase her out of the entertainment circle!”

“Do it in secret.” Lu Tingxiao warned.

“Yes, rest assured, CEO Lu!”

After hanging up the call, Liang Feixing immediately handed over all his tasks to the vice director and personally handled this matter.

This matter was no challenge at all. Having him work on it was like using a guillotine to kill a chicken. The artiste fighting with Jia Qingqing had already completed 80% of the work, so he only needed to give it the final push.

However, Jia Qingqing was just a second-rate artiste. What had she done to have the big boss personally give the order for execution?

No matter how Liang Feixing guessed, he probably couldn’t guess that Lu Tingxiao’s true aim wasn’t to block Jia Qingqing from the entertainment circle, but to support a little actress whose name he probably didn’t even know, Ning Xi…

The next morning.

When Ning Xi woke up, she was a little stupefied. Why was she lying in the Lu residence?

She had clearly played games with Little Treasure for two hours straight, then she had fallen asleep on the sofa in Jiang Muye’s living room out of fatigue afterwards…

While in a daze, a bang sounded from the window behind the bed.

Ning Xi suffered a fright, and hurriedly climbed up to check what was happening.

When she opened the window, she saw a golden head of hair below…

Ning Xi’s head was full of sweatdrops, “Jiang Muye, what are you doing here?”

Jiang Muye, who had always cared the most about his image, was actually still wearing the same clothes from last night. By this time, his outfit was all wrinkled, and his hair was messy. He said impatiently, “Ning Xi, come down right now! I have something to tell you! Quickly!”

Ning Xi sighed, feeling a headache coming on. She knew that nothing good would come of this guy knowing where she lived. As expected, he had come to throw stones at her window at such an early hour in the morning.
