Chapter 155: Too Savage

Lu Jingli was about to burst through the door and save her, but when he saw that the situation had been completely turned around, he froze on the spot and stared blankly.

“Singlehandedly… Goddamnit, she actually brought a gun! Holy shit! If I’m not wrong, that’s actually a Beretta 92F! Where did she get that?” Lu Jingli looked incredulous.

After he finished speaking, a tragic thought flashed through his mind: his second chance today at being a hero and saving the damsel in distress had just died a premature death!Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Inside the room, Zhang Jiang stared rigidly at the gun in Ning Xi’s hand. He was deathly afraid that she would open fire without saying a word again. She hadn’t even given him a chance to react. She was too cruel!

“I-I-I… Everything I said was the truth! There wasn’t a single lie! Otherwise, may lightning strike me on the spot!”

Ning Xi didn’t speak, and it wasn’t clear if she actually believed him. She spun the gun in her hands until it almost became an indistinct blur.

My great ancestor! Be careful not to accidentally set it off!

Zhang Jiang was about to pee his pants from watching her. Trembling with fear, he asked hurriedly, “If… If you want me to lie and testify that it was that person… that it was Ning Xueluo who paid me to do it… I can do that! Without conditions! I’ll do everything you want unconditionally! The instigator can be whoever you want it to be!”

Lies?

What she wanted was conclusive proof!

Ning Xi pointed the gun barrel at his chin and spoke, “Give me the account number that the other party used to wire you the money and all the emails they sent as well.”

“Okay, okay. They’re on my computer, I’ll go grab it right now! However, the emails are anonymous and even the bank account is an anonymous overseas account. They’re probably useless even if I give them to you…” As he spoke, Zhang Jiang fished out a laptop from underneath his blanket. Next, he showed her the other party’s emails and wire transfer details.

Ning Xi glanced over everything. After confirming that there were no issues, she said, “This computer is mine now. Do you have any objections?”

Zhang Jiang shook his head violently, “No, no. My great ancestor, please go ahead and take it! Take whatever you want to take!”

Ning Xi sneered. Hah. He had gone from calling her ‘big sister’ to ‘great ancestor’.

With a scoundrel like this, even if you tried to reason with him, he would never listen. If you tried to negotiate with him, he would be insatiable: give an inch, and he’ll take a mile. If you tried to play tricks, he would become even more cunning. Therefore, the only method left was to counter violence with violence.

This was actually her first time using this gun after returning to this country. It was impossible not to be nervous, but at least she was skilled at acting. As long as she pretended that she was acting, she could calm down instantly.

She had casually chosen to play the role of a homicidal maniac. It looked like she had gotten a pretty good result.

Acting was her beloved profession, as well as her way of protecting herself.

“Then, great ancestor, is there anything else you need?” Zhang Jiang nervously gulped when he saw that she still didn’t have any intention of leaving.

With a sharp gaze, Ning Xi sized him up as if thinking about something, “Yeah… Let me think for a bit…”

“Think… think about what?”

“Of course I’m thinking about… whether I should kill you to eliminate any witnesses. What if you tell someone else that I forced you to give your confession after this?” Ning Xi used a very natural tone and she looked extremely serious.

Zhang Jiang nearly knelt in front of her as he lost all strength in his legs, “That’s impossible! I wouldn’t dare to do that even if you gave me nerves of steel!”

He was speaking the truth. It was in his nature to bully the weak and fear the strong. This time, Ning Xi had scared him out of his wits.

He really never expected that this seemingly weak and delicate young lady would have such a terrifying side to her. He didn’t even dare to look directly into her dark and sinister eyes, in fear that he would have nightmares at night.

Ning Xi laughed lightly and used the gun barrel to pat his cheek, “Don’t worry. I won’t kill you, I’ll even give you money.”
