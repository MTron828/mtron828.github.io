Chapter 34: What a Show of Affection Between Father and Daughter

“We didn’t think that Chairman Ning would have the time to come to our opening ceremony, it’s really such an honour!” Director Guo greeted him warmly in a humble manner.

“Come, sit over here, Chairman Ning!” Producer Wang gave his seat to Chairman Ning so he could sit next to Ning Xueluo.

Ning Yaohua looked at Ning Xueluo lovingly, “Director Guo is being too courteous, my daughter is under your care.”

“The apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree. Chairman Ning, your daughter is so talented that she doesn’t need my care at all!”

“This child is always so busy! Even as her father, I have to personally make a trip or else I wouldn’t get to see her!” Ning Yaohua said angrily. Although he said it with a straight face, there wasn’t a trace of actual anger in his eyes, only fondness.

“Hahaha, you should be happy that Xueluo works so hard. However, Xueluo, you’re also in the wrong. No matter how hard you’re working, you should always return home!” Director Guo got angry.

“I know, Director. I shouldn’t have done that! Dad, don’t get angry, I’ll be home for dinner tomorrow night!” Ning Xueluo hugged Ning Yaohua’s arm and acted coquettishly, having the appearance of an obedient daughter.

“Look at this, I need the director to help me talk to my daughter before she agrees to come home for dinner!”

“Dad, there are so many people here, leave me some dignity!”

“Yes yes yes, you’re a big star now, I can’t even admonish you anymore!”

……

Ning Xi thought that she had already refined her heart into steel. She didn’t think that she would see such a show of fatherly affection and daughterly devotion here. Her chest tightened to the point of suffocating, and she was close to bolting out the door.

Although she couldn’t control her inner heart, she could cover it up by acting perfectly on the surface. She discussed the script with the screenwriter calmly, as if she didn’t notice what was going on opposite her.

She could ignore it, but some people were unable to do so. Ning Yaohua’s gaze was like a knife cutting her body, as if seeing her at a public event was something shameful and disgusting.

Ning Xi finally borrowed the excuse of needing the washroom to leave the room and get some fresh air next to an open window in the corridor.

She dug in her bag and brought out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. She held onto the thin cigarette for quite a while before finally putting it back.

She was in the middle of quitting.

Today was the first time she had actually lost to the urge.

The night breeze blowing strongly on her face helped her feel a little better.

At this moment, the sound of footsteps sounded from behind her.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ning Xi’s back stiffened, but she turned anyway. The expression on her face was like a mask that revealed no emotions, “Are you looking for me, Chairman Ning?”

Ning Yaohua stared at her with a heavy gaze, looking at her eye-catching outfit unhappily.

Ning Xi lowered her eyes and smiled shallowly, “Heh, Chairman Ning, you were also staring at me in this manner in the room just now. Aren’t you afraid that others will mistake your intentions towards me?”

In the eyes of others, he was a sponsor, while her identity was that of a pretty female starlet. It was the easiest kind of relationship to start rumours about.

“You bastard, what kind of words are you saying?” Ning Yaohua was abruptly in a rage.

Ning Xi raised her brows, “Of course I’m speaking in a human language, is Chairman Dong not human?”

“You…” Ning Yaohua suddenly raised his hand.

Before it landed, it was grabbed by a slender wrist.

How could she allow Ning Yaohua to hit her again?

He didn’t have the right to do so.

Ning Yaohua was enraged. He violently pulled his hand back, “I want you to withdraw from this role right now. Don’t shame me in front of others!”

Ning Xi’s expression was cold, “I got this role fair and square, so how would it shame you in any way?”

“You’re just following whatever Xueluo wants to do. Take a look at yourself, you can’t measure up to Xueluo. You were so eager to enter the entertainment industry. Are you just waiting for someone to dig out your dirty past and shame the Ning family?” Ning Yaohua watched her with an expression of extreme disgust.
