Chapter 46: You Are My Angel

“Ning Xi, Producer Wang, Screenwriter Ye and I are all extremely satisfied with you. However, the cruel reality is that our feelings aren’t enough to film a movie. The most important thing is funding, so we don’t have any control over things like casting sometimes. Who gets to have the final say? Of course it’s the person who put in the most money!”

Ning Xi’s heart slowly sunk as she listened. She had been switched, hadn’t she? Why did Chang Li inform her about the filming then?

“Last night, Director Ning did talk to me. He disagreed with your casting because he felt that you were too new, however…” Guo Qisheng paused.

Ning XI hated that she couldn’t pull him over through the phone so she could give him a good shake. Couldn’t he say everything all at once?

“However, Ning Xi, you’re in luck. Another sponsor seems to have taken a liking to you. They indicated that they wouldn’t accept anyone else playing Meng Changge. Work hard!”

“Really?” Ning Xi’s bruised heart was suddenly flying in midair. She felt like she had been taken for a rollercoaster ride by the director, it was too much excitement for her heart! “Director Guo, you did that on purpose, didn’t you! I almost had a heart attack from the fright!”

“Hahaha, youngsters these days can’t keep their cool, eh?”

“Stop beating around the bush and just tell me already! Have I been replaced?”

“No, no. That sponsor has invested 50 million- that’s the combined investment of the Ning family and Starlight Entertainment, so he gets to have the final say!”

“I thought the only sponsors for this movie were the Ning family and Starlight. How did another sponsor appear out of nowhere?” Ning Xi felt that it was a little strange.

“It’s a sponsor that came in at the last minute, you’ll find out soon enough.” Guo Qisheng sounded like he was in high spirits.

How could he be unhappy at this point? A 50 million yuan sponsorship had come out of nowhere, and his movie now had a total of 1 billion yuan in sponsorship. Furthermore, he no longer needed to bow to the whims of the ignorant sponsors and swap out the actress he was most satisfied with.

“Got it! Thanks director!”

Ning Xi had just hung up when the door opened with a creak- it was the sleepy-looking little bun.

She squealed in happiness and threw herself onto the little bun, hugging and kissing him fiercely, “Darling! You’re my lucky star! You’ve helped me avoid disaster every time!”

From outside the door, the great demon king watched the girl kissing his son excitedly.

It was clearly all his hard work…

Forget it, nothing else was more important than seeing the girl’s bright and beautiful smile.

Lu Tingxiao strolled in, “Did something good happen?”

Ning Xi hugged the little bun who had been dazed by her sudden enthusiasm, “The director just told me that I won’t be swapped out because the biggest sponsor for this movie took a liking to me!”

“Oh? Congratulations then!” Lu Tingxiao congratulated her in a deliberately serious manner.

Ning Xi rubbed her chin as she pondered, “The director didn’t reveal the identity of the sponsor though. Well, they must be someone with especially good taste and vision! Someone who’s really, really handsome!”

Lu Tingxiao smiled slightly, “You think so?”

“Of course!” Ning Xi was already acting protective. She suddenly thought of something, “I’ll be filming in the day for most of the time, and I may have some scenes to film at night as well. What will happen to Little Treasure?”

Lu Tingxiao did not answer, but looked to his son.

After receiving Ning Xi’s warm kisses and hugs, the little bun was in a very good mood. However, upon hearing this bad news, his expression remained blissful. He trotted back to his room.

Thinking that he was going to lock himself up again, Ning Xi tensed up. She didn’t expect that he would return quickly with a writing board in his hands.

The words on the board read: fighting.

Ning Xi was so touched that she was about to cry, “Thank you darling, you’re really my angel!”

Lu Tingxiao watched the two embracing, his gentle gaze filled with unprecedented warmth.
