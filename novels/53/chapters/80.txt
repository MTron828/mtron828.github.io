Chapter 81: The Little Deer is About To Faint

After hearing the discussion of the people at the other table, Ning Xi’s heart was beating like a drum.

Brother, if you have something to say, say it properly. How are you able to tell that Lu Tingxiao is looking at me differently?

Furthermore, with the eyes of a loving husband…?

“Hehe, maybe that guy’s eyes aren’t too good!” Ning Xi coughed drily as she spoke to Lu Tingxiao.

Ning Xi had just finished speaking, when she saw that woman nod in agreement, “You’re right, it really is! When you look closely at the little boy, although he looks a lot like his dad, his eyes are very similar to his mum’s, especially when he smiles…”

Ning Xi was about to go into depression after hearing this, “Uh, that lady’s eyes… might not be too good either…”

How could the little bun look like her! She’s not the little bun’s mother!

Without batting an eyelid, Lu Tingxiao glanced at the girl’s eyes. Actually, they really were pretty alike.

He had noticed previously, that when Little Treasure smiled, his brows and air were quite similar to Ning Xi’s.

If it was just a coincidence, it was quite a happy fate…

This brief interlude passed quickly.

After settling down into their seats, Ning Xi let out a sigh of relief, “Ah! It’s the most enjoyable feeling when you eat hotpot in an airconditioned place in summer! Darling Little Treasure, I swear you’ll fall in love with this feeling!”

This was the first time that the little bun had gone out for a meal in two years. He was curious towards everything, and looked about everywhere. However, it was only when his little hand was held in Ning Xi’s hand that he would remain calm.

Ning Xi flipped through the menu, then asked Lu Tingxiao for his opinion, “You can’t eat spicy food, so let’s order a hotpot with spicy and non-spicy soups?”

“You decide.” Lu Tingxiao nodded, took off his coat, and let his arm rest casually on the back of the seat.

It was an extremely normal action, but when he did that, he seemed to exude pheromones, causing Ning Xi to feel like a little deer was bumping around in her heart.

She didn’t know what had happened recently. It seemed like incidents like this were happening even more frequently. The little deer in her heart was about to faint from bumping about too much!

Was Lu Tingxiao doing that on purpose or not?

Very quickly, the soup base and dishes they had ordered arrived. Ning Xi tossed everything to the back of her head in favour of appeasing her hunger.

The Great Demon King Lu was rather strict in the way he ate hotpot. He had everything calculated perfectly, from the order of the items to place in the hotpot, to how long it would take for that particular item to cook. Furthermore, he was regularly serving her and the little bun the whole time. It was even more professional than the time they had eaten hotpot at her home.

Ning Xi had never eaten such a worry-free hotpot before. All she had to do was focus on eating. Every item was cooked to perfection, not like how she would accidentally cook items for too short or too long a time.

“Are you working with Muye on the same set?” While eating, Lu Tingxiao suddenly asked a question.

Ning Xi stared blankly for a moment before she reacted. Jiang Muye was the hot young guy who was one of the main pillars for Golden Age, and he was also Lu Tingxiao’s nephew. It wasn’t strange that Lu Tingxiao knew of his situation. Thus, she nodded, “Yeah, he entered the set today. Actually, I only knew of it today, I was shocked to see him…”

Lu Tingxiao placed a fishball in her bowl. He said in a careless tone, “Are you good friends?”

Ning Xi scratched her head, but felt that there was nothing to hide, thus she answered honestly: “This… The relationship between us is a little hard to explain. We dated for some time, but we’ve already broken up for a very long time. Right now, we’re friends! However, I’m guessing that we’re not even going to remain friends very soon. That fellow started pulling all sorts of hate to me the moment he came back, he’s almost killing me…”

“If he bullies you, tell me.” Lu Tingxiao said.

Ning Xi smiled and said, “Haha, that won’t happen. In the movie, I’m always bullying him in our scenes. As for outside the movie, hmph! If he dares to bully me, I’ll just go and become his aunt and use my seniority to suppress him!”

After saying so, both Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao were in a daze.

Ning Xi hated that she couldn’t slam her head into the ground: Why. Couldn’t. She. Hold. Back. This. Dratted. Loose. Mouth!
