Chapter 198: He Kissed You Right in Front of Me

Translator: Henyee  Editor: Henyee

“Hey, Jiang…”

“Ning Xiao Xi! You actually signed with Glory World!!! Why didn’t you discuss it with me! Did you see the email that I sent you or not?!” Jiang Muye roared down the line.

“Eh, aren’t you busy? I didn’t want to disturb you. Anyway, what does it have to do with the email you sent me?” Jiang Muye’s voice was really too loud. Ning Xi smiled at Lu Tingxiao awkwardly, and then took the phone with her upstairs.

Behind her, Lu Jingli touched his chin, and gave his brother a meaningful look. “Brother, it seems that someone wants to get in your way! Heh, that poor thing, to actually like the same woman as you! Fortunately, Xiao Xi Xi is not my type, tsk tsk…”

Rivals in love were too scary!

On the phone, Jiang Muye was about to die from all his anger. “Until now you still haven’t seen the email?”

“I’m sorry, I forgot! Is it very important? I thought it was another spoof video or something…”

Jiang Muye took a deep breath, and said very slowly, “You, now, at once, immediately, this very second, open your inbox and look at what I sent you. Don’t hang up, open it right now!”

“Ok, ok, ok! I’ll take a look at it now!”

Ning Xi turned on her computer resignedly, and found the email which Jiang Muye had sent to her. She then downloaded the attachment in the email.

It contained an image and an audio file.

She opened the image first. It was a screencap of a WeChat chat.

[Aiya, my good grandson is too cute, aiya, my son is too handsome! Tingxiao, who picked the clothes for you and Little Treasure? Was it the girl you like?]

[Yes.]

[I knew it, you would never choose this style! Look at how bright the color is, it looks so good! It’s nothing like the dull clothes you wear all the time, and Little Treasure has to suffer the same dull style too! As expected, this house does need a woman!]

[She also took these photos?]

[Yes.]

[Not bad.]

[Damn, my future sister-in-law is unbelievable! She can actually make you wear this color, and you even let her take photos! I gave you some clothes in a similar color before, and you looked at me so scornfully. You even belittled my taste!]

…

Looking at the chat, she saw that it was Lu Tingxiao, the two Lu family elders, and Lu Jingli.

“Are you looking at it?” Jiang Muye urged her.

“Yes.” Ning Xi nodded, a complicated expression on her face, and then clicked open the audio.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After a few rustling sounds, Jiang Muye’s voice came out…

“Uncle — what exactly are your intentions towards Ning Xi?”

Then there was the sound of Lu Tingxiao’s voice: “Towards Ning Xi…”

“Yes! Don’t you think your attitude towards her is too strange and too intimate?” Jiang Muye asked.

Lu Tingxiao’s tone was both languid and dangerous. “I thought I was already obvious enough, but since you still don’t understand…”

Listening up to this point, Ning Xi’s heart was suddenly in her throat, as if she could feel Jiang Muye’s mood while he waited for Lu Tingxiao’s reply.

Lu Tingxiao… what would he say?

She waited for three seconds, which felt like three centuries. Then Lu Tingxiao’s voice finally sounded again.

He said: “Understand?”

Ning Xi was confused. What situation? Understand what?

Just as Ning Xi thought she had missed something, and was about to replay the video, Jiang Muye’s cold voice came through the phone. “You don’t need to listen to it again. You didn’t hear wrong, he really did only say that one word. But before he said it, he kissed you in front of me.”
