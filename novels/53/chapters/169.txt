Chapter 170: How Could It Be Ning Xi

“Ning Xi? Where? Where?”

“Ning Xi’s here? That can’t be! She actually dared to appear here?”

“Over there, over there!”

……

In an instant, all the reporters looked over and started to bring up their cameras, ready to shoot the latest headlines.

Ning Xi’s brows drew together. Her first reaction was to protect Little Treasure and not to let them scare him. She wasn’t too bothered about protecting herself.

However, without waiting for her to cover the little bun, she felt a large palm press her head into a warm embrace. Following that, the little bun’s soft, tiny hand grasped one of her hands tightly, as if reassuring her and telling her not to be afraid.

As for those reporters, they all stopped ten steps away from them.

Two tall men in sunglasses and suits had appeared out of nowhere. With fierce expressions, they blocked the reporters’ path like bouncers.

“Hey, who are you? Get out of the way! Good dogs don’t block the way!” One of the reporters was so focused on grabbing the juicy news that he blurted out words without thinking.

However, there was a quick-witted person in the crowd who quickly pulled back the speaker and spoke with an extremely frightened expression, as if he had seen something terrifying: “Are you crazy?! Those are bodyguards from the Lu Corporation!”

“Lu… Lu… Surely you don’t mean that Lu?”

“You don’t say! How many Lus are there in this capital!?”

“How do you know that? It’s not like it’s carved on their faces!”

“Are you stupid? Can’t you see the symbol on their uniforms?”

After getting reminded, everyone retreated as one, taking three steps back. Those who had lashed out hurriedly apologised in panic, “Hey, brothers, sorry about that, sorry! We were too blind to recognise Mt. Tai! Please don’t hold it against us!”

Heavens! These were the Lu family’s private bodyguards? Then who were the three people behind them?

The reporters tried to peep behind the bodyguards, but when their eyes slid past the men in suits, all of them retreated back with pale faces.

The tall man currently embracing a woman in his arms had a face like frost and looked like a god. However, his gaze was far too fierce right now, and his aura was too oppressive. The more experienced reporters were usually good at reading people, and they could tell that it wouldn’t be good to provoke this man. Thus, they calmed down at the same time and realised that there was something fishy about the situation…CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“What Ning Xi? You must have seen wrongly! They’re a family of three! How could that woman be Ning Xi!”

“That’s right! Have you gone crazy while thinking too much about snatching up juicy news? Going around thinking that any random stranger looks like Ning Xi!”

“That person can’t be trifled with! Are you trying to kill us all!?”

All the reporters started to complain against the person who had spotted Ning Xi.

“Uh, it was probably my mistake. But she does look a little like Ning Xi, didn’t you guys think so too…?”

“How are they alike at all!? That Ning Xi is a cruel and wicked woman! This lady has a noble and refined air, and she’s clearly a good wife and mother. How could they be the same person?”

“That’s right! She looks like such a sweet lady and she’s so cute! How could she possibly be Ning Xi, that bewitching bitch!?”

……

At this moment, the elevator arrived with a ding.

The reporters were still lamenting on the spot when the family of three had already disappeared into the elevator:

“Wow, did you see that little boy just now? He’s too cute! He looked like he was carved from the same mold as that man just now, they’re definitely father and son!”

“What relation does that man have to the Lu family? His aura was so scary!”

“I keep getting the feeling that that man looked a little familiar… Uh, why do I feel like… he seems a little like the God of Fortune himself?”

“Now that you mention it! They do look similar! That boy… could he be the legendary little prince?”
