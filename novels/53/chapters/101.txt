Chapter 102: A Mistress Masquerading as a Rich Heiress

A second later, Ning Xi was rendered speechless.

@LittleKoiPrince was verified on Weibo as: Golden Age Entertainment’s Acting CEO Lu Jingli… You’re the boss of a big entertainment company! Why is your ID this corny? It’s like you’re still in middle school!

She hadn’t anticipated that the investor who had joined at the last moment was actually Lu Jingli. This was beyond her expectations, but still within reason. After all, this was Jiang Muye’s first big film after returning to the country. It was only natural that Golden Age would spend a lot of effort to support it.

However, Golden Age really lived up to its reputation as the industry’s richest company by dropping 50 million on a mere second male lead role.

All the misunderstandings were resolved with Wang Taihe’s Weibo post. While the stains on Ning Xi’s reputation had been thoroughly wiped clean, Jia Qingqing was now saddled with the reputation of being an arrogant, despicable and trashy actress. Unfortunately, even though more observant people had already realized that Jia Qingqing was the instigator behind Ning Xi’s scandal, there was no conclusive evidence.

Everything that had happened up to this point were within Ning Xi’s predictions. However, she didn’t expect an even more shocking development would come later.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Late last night, Jia Qingqing’s manager Han Ying had posted on Weibo.

Han Ying directly exposed how Jia Qingqing had made use of her fans to slander Ning Xi. She even spilled the entire story of how Jia Qingqing had used a second account to disguise herself as one of Jiang Muye’s fans in order to rile them up and use them to attack Ning Xi.

Han Ying also revealed something even more shocking: Jia Qingqing was actually a mistress masquerading as a rich heiress!

The rich father she was rumored to have wasn’t actually her father. In reality, he was her sugar daddy and he already had a wife and kids.

Han Ying’s Weibo post contained extremely damning chat records and scandalous revelations. No matter what Jia Qingqing tried to say, she still wouldn’t be able to talk her way out of this.

Currently, there was only one path left for Jia Qingqing. Quietly going into retirement.

As for a comeback, in the unpredictable and tumultuous entertainment industry, her chances of coming out of retirement were virtually zero.

After Han Ying had violated the ethics of her profession by exposing the secrets of an entertainer under her management, her own career as a manager was basically over as well. What sort of conflict did she have with Jia Qingqing that pushed her to cause their mutual destruction? It was a mystery.

After the matter blew up, Starlight Entertainment tried to delete the post and end the gossip, but unfortunately, they couldn’t resolve the situation. Instead, the netizens became even angrier.

In order to appease the enraged public, Starlight attempted to do damage control by releasing a statement saying that they would launch a thorough investigation regarding the role Jia Qingqing played in slandering Ning Xi. The company didn’t touch on the matter of Jia Qingqing being a sugar baby, but they basically expressed that they would investigate further. They were clearly unwilling to let go of Jia Qingqing, whom they had spent so much money developing.

Ning Xi didn’t have any scenes to film today, so she had originally planned to spend the day relaxing at home. However, it couldn’t be helped that the situation had blown up so much. Her plans for rest were cancelled. Right after finishing breakfast, she got a phone call and had to go down to the company.

In the conference room, Ning Xueluo, Chang Li, and Jia Qingqing were all present. The head of public relations, Feng Haoyang, was also in attendance.

Jia Qingqing’s head was lowered and she had large dark circles under her eyes. The moment she saw Ning Xi, she quickly stood up in a frenzy, “Ning Xi, you bitch! Are you proud of yourself now? Just you wait, I’m not going to let you off!”

Ning Xi helplessly scratched her ear. Every time, it was more or less the same line. She had almost reached the point of becoming deaf.

“Shut up! Don’t you think you’ve stirred up enough trouble?” Feng Haoyang scolded impatiently.

As unwilling as she was, Jia Qingqing could only sit back down while feeling wronged. When her spineless sugar daddy had seen that their affair had been exposed, he had immediately cut off all contact. At this moment, her fate was entirely in the hands of Feng Haoyang.

“Sit.” Feng Haoyang said to Ning Xi. His expression was full of hesitation, as if he was trying to make a decision.

At this time, Chang Li who was sitting nearby spoke up, “Ning Xi, you should know of what happened last night so I’m not going to explain it all again. This is how things are going to go down. In a moment, Qingqing will release a statement apologizing for slandering you. You will respond by saying that you were also in the wrong. Act a little more magnanimous and say that you have forgiven her.”
