“Yes.”

Ning Xi scratched her head, feeling awkward, “This… isn’t this a little inappropriate? I can come over at any time if Little Treasure wants to see me!”

Lu Tingxiao massaged his brow tiredly, “There are too many unknown factors, especially at night. It would be too dangerous if we had an emergency situation, and you sped over here on your bike again. With my identity, it’s not convenient to keep bringing Little Treasure over to visit either. I know this request puts you on the spot. As Little Treasure’s father, I would still like to make this request of you. I hope you can agree.”

Ning Xi started to feel a headache coming on.

She would definitely have turned and left if Lu Tingxiao had used his power to force her into it. However, he was not using his identity in the slightest, he was instead sincerely pleading her. It was hard for her to reject it when facing such an exceedingly handsome face!

Lu Jingli was watching his dear brother with eyes of admiration.

Too amazing!

He didn’t think that his brother would use such a high end technique. Turning a disadvantage into an advantage, he opened up a road on the path to capturing Ning Xi’s heart.

Little Treasure’s existence turned into his greatest support instead of becoming an obstacle.

It was at this moment that Little Treasure jumped out of bed with a frightened expression, knocking over the bedside lamp with a bang.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The fear in the little guy’s eyes only faded after he saw Ning Xi. He shot over to her leg like an arrow.

The extreme fear in those eyes would make anyone’s heart ache for him.

Ning Xi hurriedly crouched down, “Darling, why did you wake up?”

The little guy buried his head into her embrace, his soft and tiny arms wrapped around her neck in a death grip.

“Shhhh, auntie’s here. Don’t be afraid…” Ning Xi patted his back lightly. The distinct sweet scent unique to children wafted up from his body. This threw Ning Xi’s emotions into turmoil.

She was obviously used to avoiding little kids, but why was she unable to hate Little Treasure…?

Ning Xi could only coax Little Treasure back to sleep again. She then stepped lightly out of the room, closing the door.

She saw that the servants had already cleaned up the mess downstairs, leaving a pristine living room.

As expected of the Lu family’s servants. Not only were they fast and efficient, they were very well-trained. All of them were very curious about Ning Xi’s arrival. Though not a single one dared to take a second look at her, much less gossip. They left quietly the moment they finished their tasks.

Seeing that she had come out of the room, Lu Tingxiao watched her silently, not saying a word or adding any pressure on her.

Ning Xi looked hesitant, but her heart turned soft when thinking of the way Little Treasure had clung onto the corner of her clothes without letting go. She took a deep breath before saying, “Okay, Mr Lu. I accept your request. Just take it as payment for how Little Treasure saved me the last time.”

Lu Tingxiao relaxed, “Thank you.”

“Little Treasure might wake up at any moment. I think I won’t be able to leave tonight, but all my things are still in my apartment…” Ning Xi was troubled.

“No problem, I’ll send someone to collect them for you.” Lu Tingxiao sent orders to the steward and made arrangements even as he was talking.

Lu Jingli, who had not been able to interject at all from start to finish, looked at the proceedings in a dazed state.

They… they were living together just like that?!

“Anything else?” Lu Tingxiao glanced towards Lu Jingli.

“I’m leaving now!” The third wheel who was being disdained by his dear brother immediately left.

He had thought that Ning Xi was a fearsome opponent, but his brother wasn’t a weakling either.

He now knew that his brother didn’t lack any skill in chasing women. It was just that he hadn’t removed his seal in the past 32 years…

Lu Tingxiao escorted Ning Xi to a room right next to Little Treasure’s bedroom, “You’ll stay here from now onwards. I’ll get someone to redecorate it in the style you like later on.”

Ning Xi hurriedly waved away the offer, “No need, no need. I’m only staying for a few days, redecorating would be too troublesome!”

“It’s no trouble at all.”

Lu Tingxiao received a large ring of keys from the steward, then passed it to her, “These are the house keys. You can enter any place you like. The main door is locked by a password, which is 591414. This key is for the attic, you must keep it carefully. Little Treasure likes to take the key and hide in the attic sometimes. This key is…”

Seeing that Lu Tingxiao had handed over every key except the one to his safe, Ning Xi hurriedly interrupted, “Wait wait wait… Mr Lu, aren’t you being too relaxed with me!? You’re not afraid that I’ll steal everything in your house?”

“What do you want? I’ll get someone to help you move it.” Lu Tingxiao said in all seriousness. It seemed like he wasn’t joking around.
