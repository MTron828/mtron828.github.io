Chapter 88: A Tyrant Flower

When the riled up crowd saw this scene, they were all struck dumb. Even Amy was scared witless.

With a pale face, Ning Xi swept an ice-cold glance across those fans, “You guys can make a commotion if you want, come at me. Don’t hurt innocent bystanders.”

“Stop… stop pretending to be good!”

“That’s right! Don’t pretend to be a good person! You’re just a shameless vixen!”

Ning Xi’s look turned even sharper, “What determines whether I’m a good person or not? An internet post without evidence to back it up? Or a rumor based on groundless accusations? Even though you are all still young, I still hope you can all use your brains before taking action. Idols are the ones who have to pay for the conduct of their fans. Your words and actions will represent your idol. Don’t allow yourselves to be ignorantly used by others and mar your idol’s reputation for no good reason!”

Ning Xi knew that at this moment, nothing she said would get through to them except mentioning their precious idol.

“When was it your turn to lecture us!”

“Actually I think she has a point… The one who just threw that rock, step out! Didn’t we agree that we wouldn’t resort to violence and using eggs would be the limit?

“That’s right! Who was it! We came to ask for justice, not to mar Muye’s reputation!”

……

The rioting fans temporarily calmed down, and Ning Xi was finally able to squeeze into the production set.

When Guo Qisheng saw that she had arrived, he immediately called her into the lounge. “Ning Xi, you’ve come! Hurry and sit down!”

“Director, I’m sorry for creating so much trouble for the production team…” Ning Xi had a guilty expression as she bowed deeply.

When he saw how haggard the girl looked, Guo Qisheng quickly comforted her, “You’re not the one creating trouble. How could I be not be aware that other people are trying to ruin you? Just based on that line about you having no acting skill, that’s simply nonsense! As for saying that you… uh, saying that you slept with members of the production team… how could I not know the truth as one of the ones implicated in the rumour? I’ve seen plenty of matters like this before. I’m clear on who’s right or wrong!”

“Thank you, Director.” The fact that Guo Qisheng was standing on her side in this sort of situation really made her grateful.

“However, this matter has really affected you too much. Just look at your haggard complexion. Why don’t you take a couple of days off to recover?” Quo Qisheng proposed.

Ning Xi immediately responded, “No need! Director, I want to continue shooting! My situation has already inconvenienced the production team enough. If this delays the production’s filming schedule even more, I really won’t be able to live with myself!”

Guo Qisheng saw her determination and showed a grateful expression, “Ay, alright then! If you reach your limit, you have to let me know!”

When she came out of her meeting with the director, a strong force suddenly pulled Ning Xi into a secluded corner.

That person’s face was full of worry and even his head of golden hair looked listless. “Ning Xi, is your arm ok?”

“It’s a small injury. It has already been treated.” Ning Xi spoke lightly.

Jiang Muye’s face was filled with anger, “I was going to issue a statement to explain to my fans, but Ming-ge changed my Weibo password and wouldn’t let me log in. He said that I would make things worse for you if I did anything right now…”

Ning Xi patted her chest and showed a glad expression, “Lucky Ming-ge has intelligence unlike some people.”

Jiang Muye immediately looked hurt, “You ungrateful woman, I was just trying to help you out!”

Ning Xi replied helplessly, “If you really want to help me, then let me give you a heads-up. In a moment, I’m going to pretend to be an innocent flower. Just act along with me, and don’t you dare act recklessly! Otherwise, don’t blame me for really breaking off all relation with you!”

Jiang Muye scratched his ear and looked rather doubtful, “What did you say you were going to pretend to be?”

“An innocent flower, is there any problem?”

“Are you sure a tyrant flower like you can complete such a difficult challenge?”

“Get lost!”
