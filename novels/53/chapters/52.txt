Chapter 53: Were You Pleased by Me?

Ning Xi remained in that awkward position. Taking it out didn’t seem right, but shoving it back in didn’t seem right either. It was really tragic.

To make matters worse, the bra she was wearing today had been specially ordered. A triangular Superman logo was printed on both sides, it was extremely eye-catching.

Lu Tingxiao had obviously noticed it. His brow ridge went up, but like a gentleman, he didn’t display any other sign of shock, he coughed lightly before saying, “Sorry, I saw that the door wasn’t closed…”

He prepared to leave when he finished speaking.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. It’s my fault for forgetting to close the door!” Ning Xi deliberately acted calm and just pulled her bra out before stuffing it under a blanket. She fanned herself with one hand, “Um, it’s just too hot in the summer. You guys wouldn’t understand the troubles women face! Uh, were you looking for me for something?”

“Why did you come back this late? A date?” Lu Tingxiao asked, seeming like he didn’t particularly care about the answer.

“What date! I just met an especially loathsome person, and talked for a bit!” Ning Xi grumbled with a wretched expression.

Listening to her tone, it was clear that it wasn’t a date. Lu Tingxiao’s expression relaxed slightly, “I left dinner for you, come and eat when you’re done with your shower.”

“Actually, I can settle my meals myself…” Ning Xi said in embarrassment.

“It’s just one more place at the table.”

“Uh, okay then.”

After Lu Tingxiao walked away, Ning Xi hurriedly locked the door.

She had forgotten that she wasn’t at home and had actually made such a rudimentary mistake. She would have to take note of that from now.

After having a shower and dinner, Ning Xi bundled up comfortably in bed and started to read the latest news on the web. Little bun was sprawled over the table, hugging a large book.

“Ning Xueluo reveals her handsome and rich boyfriend, screen king Zhao bursts out in jealousy on the scene”

“Ning Xueluo is full of praises for junior Ning Xi’s beauty and acting skills”

“Ning Xi fully deserves the title of #1 Beauty in the entertainment circle, suppressing Jia Qingqing”

“Meng Changge outshines the other beauties at?Land Under Heaven?’s opening ceremony (photos)”

“First day of filming for ?Land Under Heaven?, Ning Xueluo’s handsome and rich boyfriend comes to visit”

“Counting down the number of rich admirers for pretty rookie Ning Xi, red roses piled on the set on the first day of filming (inside photos)”

……

The headlines were still rather normal at first, but towards the end, they got a little strange. Topics like “Ning Xi is being kept as a mistress”, “Ning Xi’s rich sponsor”, “Ning Xi’s cheating on how many men?”, “The mess in Ning Xi’s private life” started appearing…

While on set, she had already been prepared, so she could stay rather calm upon seeing these.

She knew that she would have gotten rumours like this sooner or later with an image like hers, even without Jiang Muye and YS’s interference that day.

The tabloids were sitting on the fence right now, since there wasn’t any concrete evidence. What she was worried about was that people would start to believe the rumours if they were mentioned often enough, regardless of whether they were true or not.

“Do you need any help?” Lu Tingxiao’s voice sounded by her ear.

Ning Xi hugged her notebook and sat up. Propping up her chin, she smiled and said, “Big Boss Lu, are you going to get rid of all the online rumours for me?”

“Why not?” Lu Tingxiao passed her and Little Treasure a cup of milk each, “Yours is low-fat.”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Thank you!” Ning Xi was overwhelmed by the unexpected care, and took the cup carefully. She spoke up, “Thank you for your good intentions, but there’s no need for that. I believe time will prove everything.”

“I believe in you.” Lu Tingxiao said.

Ning Xi was dazed for a moment before helplessly holding her forehead, “Lu Tingxiao, has anyone ever told you that you’re really good at wheeling!”

“Wheeling?” Suspicion flashed across Lu Tingxiao’s face, he clearly didn’t know what this internet term meant.

“Um… It means that you’re good at coaxing girls to be happy!” Ning Xi gave a simplified explanation.

A smile rippled in Lu Tingxiao’s eyes when he heard so, “I’m happy with your evaluation. Does this mean you were pleased by me?”

The atmosphere turned pink.

Ning Xi’s cheeks were burning in an instant. She was vexed at herself in her heart: who told you to have such a loose mouth! Your loose mouth led to such a dangerous topic!

Luckily, Lu Tingxiao always knew when to step back, “I’m going to look at some documents in my study. Remember to rest early, both of you. Good night.”

Ning Xi: “Good night~”

Little Treasure: “…”

Although little bun didn’t say anything, his intentions were clearly written on his face: “Hurry up and go, don’t disturb me and Auntie Xiao Xi~”
