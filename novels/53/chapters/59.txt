Chapter 60: I’ll Love You for a Thousand Years!

It wasn’t that Ning Xi had not felt Lu Tingxiao’s different attitude towards her, but every time, he would stop right at the boundary of good friends. If she reacted too drastically, then it would seem like she was imagining feelings when there weren’t any.

Thus, when Ning Xi heard this very ordinary question, she answered it in a normal manner: “Male!”

Lu Tingxiao’s unfathomable gaze narrowed imperceptibly, “Are you coming back tonight?”

These questions… were getting more and more…

Ning Xi used her acting skills and pretended not to have noticed the hidden meaning of the question, she replied nonchalantly, “I’m not too sure yet, I’ll give you a call then! It’s almost time for me to go, I’m going upstairs first!”

There were definitely going to be some unexpected situations popping up later. What if she couldn’t hold back and beat up that kid, Jiang Muye, for the whole night?

Ning Xi hurriedly grabbed a large, black duffel bag from upstairs, then hugged and kissed the little bun goodbye.

Watching the girl practically fly off, Lu Tingxiao’s face was like snow in August.

Other than Ning Xi, the little bun was completely uninterested in anything else, including his own daddy. However, upon seeing his daddy trying to suppress the gloominess in his expression, he bent his head to write something on his notepad, then reached out to poke him with a tiny finger.

Feeling the small pressure on his arm, Lu Tingxiao lowered his gaze and saw the question mark that his son had written on his notepad.

“You’re asking me why I’m unhappy?” Lu Tingxiao raised a brow, then paused in deep thought for a moment. He finally spoke up faintly, “If your Auntie Xiao Xi becomes someone else’s someday… If she calls someone else darling, kisses someone else good morning, good night and goodbye, eats hotpot with someone else… and you’re no longer anyone to her, without even the right to question her or get angry with her… would you be happy?”

Little Treasure was dazed for a moment before his expression instantly changed to one that looked as if the sky had fallen.

Thus, a certain daddy became a little calmer.

With tears trickling down his cheeks, Little Treasure snatched away his heartless daddy’s phone and complained to Auntie Xiao Xi.

He sent a crying emoji to Ning Xi: (>?<?)?

Ning Xi, who was hurrying to the airport, thought that the little bun was upset because they weren’t going to eat hotpot. She immediately gathered a bunch of sweet words to console the little bun: Aiyah, darling, what happened? You’re not happy? Don’t be upset, if you’re sad, then auntie will be sad too! Auntie really has something to do today, I’ll definitely accompany you to eat hotpot tomorrow, okay? Xoxo! I’ll love you for a thousand years! I love darling’s smile the most!

Little Treasure looked at Ning Xi’s reply, and his tears turned into smiles. He even proudly showed the phone to his daddy.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Lu Tingxiao glanced at the sweet words Ning Xi had sent, “…”

He felt like he had been stabbed in the heart…

Two hours later, at Beijing Airport.

Although Ning Xi had already been prepared before she had come, she was still scared silly by the scene before her.

“AHHH! Jiang Muye! Jiang Muye! Jiang Muye!”

“Hubbie look over here! Hubbie I love you! Hubbie I want to give birth to your kids!”

“Muye, Muye, you’re the coolest! Yezi will always support you!”

……

Teenage girls were the most numerous amongst the fans, she even saw some middle-aged women and quite a few male fans. They were all shouting at the top of their lungs. All the security guards at the airport had been deployed, but they still weren’t able to control the situation.

“My dear wives, could you keep it quiet? Don’t disturb others! Shhhhh!”

A sexy voice sounded from the crowd, and all the fans suddenly went silent, before they burst out into screams that almost burst through the roof. The scene had not calmed down at all, but turned even more lively.

Ning Xi hid behind a pillar and looked on from afar, her head full of sweat drops.

This guy deserved to get cut up by a thousand knives, he was definitely out to kill her!

If she went out to pick him up at this time, could she even live past tonight?

Luckily she came prepared…
