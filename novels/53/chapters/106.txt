Chapter 107: Men In Love

Ning Xi had been prepared to pay herself at first, since she was going to treat it as a present for the little bun. She hadn’t expected that such an embarrassing situation would happen.

She liked the outfit too much; the thought of something that should belong to the little bun going to someone like Ying Fanglin made her feel extremely uncomfortable. Finally, she had still taken out the black card that Lu Tingxiao had given her to settle the bill.

Once Ning Xi had taken out the card, it was the shop assistant and the two ladies’ turn to stare blankly.

The shop assistant was rather experienced and knowledgeable, so she recognised the card with one glance. Ying Fanglin and Jin Xuanxuan had never seen the real thing, but socialites were naturally more aware of things like this. They could also recognise that it was the real ‘King of Cards’, the limitless black card that only existed in limited numbers in the entire world.

The threshold for this card was extremely high, and the annual fees were shocking. The service you could get with this card was first-rate all over the world. As it hadn’t been publicly announced, you couldn’t take the initiative to apply for it. Only 1% of platinum cardholders were chosen and invited to apply for the card, so even if you had money, you wouldn’t necessarily be able to get it. The only ones who could get that card were either important political leaders, multi-millionaires or famous people in society.

Ying Fanglin’s face was stiff. She harrumphed, “It couldn’t be a fake card, could it! Miss, you had better check it properly!”

Although the shop assistant had seen it before, she had only ever seen it once. She received the card cautiously and started to operate the credit card machine.

Ten seconds later, the shop assistant immediately had a 1000 megawatt smile on her face as she bowed at 90 degrees, “Miss, it’s done. I’ll help you wrap it up.”

Ning Xi nodded, “Thanks.”

Ying Fanglin and Jin Xuanxuan were rooted to the spot in a daze. They looked at each other, then looked at Ning Xi as if they had seen a ghost.

Ning Xi grabbed the bag and prepared to leave.

While watching Ning Xi’s leaving back, Ying Fanglin gritted her teeth and said with a malicious expression, “Why is she acting so proud, she must surely be some rich old man’s mistress! Does she think she can marry into money just by giving him a son?”

“That’s right, she’ll surely be bullied by the legal wife someday!” Jin Xuanxuan chimed in.

……

After leaving the children’s clothing section, Ning Xi passed by the menswear section while heading downstairs.

Oh, it looked like the brand that Lu Tingxiao usually wore was right in front of her.

The style suited Lu Tingxiao as a whole. With black, white and gray as the main colours, it looked haughty yet restrained.

After looking at it for a moment, her gaze shifted to a new brand that had become trendy in the recent years. Comparing the two brands, the newer brand had more vibrant colours and the clothes were designed with more younger styles.

Ning Xi rubbed her chin, suddenly thinking of buying an outfit for Lu Tingxiao as well.

She was a woman after all. A woman was a creature who could plan to buy just a pair of shoes at first, but would eventually end up buying clothes, bags, accessories to match with those shoes.

After buying something for the little bun, she couldn’t resist the urge to help Lu Tingxiao change up his style a little.

After hesitating for three minutes, Ning Xi made the decision: she was going to buy it!

Thus, she walked into the shop and just bought the suit on the mannequin that was the exact same sapphire blue as the one she had bought for Little Treasure.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

At the same time, in the office of the Lu Corporation’s CEO, Lu Tingxiao was listening to Lu Jingli’s report when his phone rang with two notifications.

When he opened it up, it was a message from the bank informing him of expenses made on his card.

Ning Xi had used his card?

A satisfied smile surfaced on Lu Tingxiao’s solemn and indifferent face.

Lu Jingli said confidently after seeing his dear brother’s expression, “Is it a message from sister-in-law?”

Lu Tingxiao: “It’s not.”

“It’s not?” That was weird!

Lu Jingli immediately leaned over the table and moved closer to look. Eh, weren’t those just messages from the bank? They were even expense notifications, not income notifications! Did he need to have such a blissful expression on?

Tsk tsk, men in love were seriously hard to understand sometimes!
