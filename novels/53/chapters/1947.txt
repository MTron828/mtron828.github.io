Chapter 1948: Mysterious Producer

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jace had never appeared in public. Even they had never seen Jace himself, including the assistant director.

“She shouldn’t have gone far! I’ll give her a call!” The assistant director said.

“It’s alright. I’ll chase her,” replied the female staff.

…

“Ning Xi, how was it?”

Xu Tao, who had been waiting outside, quickly asked her when she came out.

Ning Xi thought about it. “Well, I’ve got half a chance, I suppose.”

“It’s awesome enough that you have some chance. Leave the rest to me and Liang Feixing. This time…”

As Xu Tao and Ning Xi were talking and walking towards the car park, suddenly there was the sound of rushed footsteps behind them.

“Ms. Ning Xi, please wait!”

Ning Xi turned around, surprised to see the staff from earlier.

“Ms. Linda?”

“Hi, Ms. Ning Xi!” Linda clasped her chest as she panted heavily.

“Hello.” Ning Xi smiled and gave her a questioning gaze, unsure why she was being chased.

“Ms. Ning Xi, our producer would like to meet with you to discuss the movie,” she said very politely.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ning Xi was stunned before she asked, “Producer? You mean Mr. Jace?”

“Yes, Mr. Jace.”

Not just Ning Xi, even Xu Tao was taken aback when they heard the affirmative answer.

“Mr. Jace wants to see Ning Xi? W-What is it about?” Xu Tao quickly asked.

“Yes, Mr. Jace wants to see Ms. Ning Xi, but I’m not sure why. Ms. Ning Xi will know once she meets him.” The lady smiled nervously as if she was afraid of messing things up and not being able to bring Ning Xi over.

Ning Xi and Xu Tao looked at each other questioningly.

While Ning Xi was popular in China, she meant nothing to Hollywood, especially for people of Jace’s caliber. He probably did not even know of her existence.

Even Ning Xi did not expect that her trying today would lead to meeting that person.

In the end, Xu Tao replied decisively, “Please lead the way!”

“Alright, follow me!” The lady looked relieved.

…

After about half an hour’s car ride, Ning Xi entered a high-class private club with the staff.

As they arrived at a room, the lady told Xu Tao, “Please wait outside here, Mister.”

She then made an inviting gesture to Ning Xi and opened the door for her.

“Thank you!” Ning Xi thanked her and took a deep breath before going inside the room.

Inside, there was an old man with a head full of white hair. He seemed to have waited for a long time.

The old man looked like he was pondering about something, then he raised his head and looked at Ning Xi’s direction when he heard sounds at the door.

Ning Xi had been preparing herself mentally on the way here, so she looked somewhat calm. “Hello, Mr. Jace.”

Ning Xi took a careful look at the old man as she greeted him. It was a standard European face around 80 years old, and he looked quite kind, which was unimaginable given Jace’s popularity.

However, Jace was a mysterious person. None of the magazines dared to put Jace’s picture on print.
