Chapter 78: You’re So Worried That I’ll Become Your Aunt?Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Seeing Ning Xi’s disgusted expression, Jiang Muye finally let out a sigh of relief. He understood Ning Xi, and he knew that what she hated the most was being tied down.

A family background like the Lu family was most likely terrifying to her…

“Alright, you’re done asking your questions. It’s my turn to ask the questions now, right?” Ning Xi crossed her arms and looked in askance at him.

Jiang Muye shrugged, “What do you want to ask?”

“I thought Lu Tingxiao only has a little brother, and doesn’t have any sisters? Where did a nephew like you come from?” Ning Xi asked.

Jiang Muye lit up a cigarette and slowly spoke up, “I’m not related by blood to the Lu family. My grandparents were great friends with the Lu family, and they died in a car accident when my mother was very young, so the Lu family adopted my mother. Following the family hierarchy, I need to call Lu Tingxiao uncle!”

“So it was like that…” Ning Xi cast him an unhappy sideways glance as she spoke, “I’m trying to quit smoking! Don’t tempt me!”

“Why are you trying to quit smoking when you were fine before?” Jiang Muye frowned.

“Do I need a reason to quit a bad habit?”

“Back then, who was it that told me: If I have alcohol today, I’ll get drunk today. If I have a cigarette today, I’ll smoke it today. Those who quit drinking and smoking are idiots…” Jiang Muye complained as he stubbed the cigarette, “I’ve already told you whatever I could. Did you have anything else you wanted to ask?”

“Of. Course!” Ning Xi gritted her teeth and glared at him, “Tell me honestly, why did you take up the role of Sun Huanqing? Not only is it a second male lead, it’s not even the type of role that you love to play usually!”

The meaning in her words was that, this guy had done it on purpose to screw with her!

Jiang Muye put on an innocent expression, “What’s wrong with me taking a second male lead? Who made a rule saying that I can’t? What’s wrong with me taking Sun Huanqing? I wanted to try challenging myself by taking a role I don’t normally do, is that not allowed? Isn’t it meaningless to keep myself in a single type of role? Didn’t I act pretty well today? You had so much fun teasing me!”

“I didn’t have fun, you idiot!”

She was definitely going to be in tears by tomorrow…

“Fine, I’m not going to play around with you anymore. I’m going back since I promised Little Treasure that I’d eat hotpot with him.” Ning Xi hurriedly looked at the time on her phone.

Jiang Muye looked unhappy, “Is my uncle going to be with you?”

“Of course he is, I don’t dare to take Little Treasure out on my own. Who’s going to take responsibility if something happens!”

Upon hearing that, Jiang Muye was so angry that he wanted to hit something, “So you do know? Little Treasure is the entire Lu family’s lifeblood, especially for his grandparents. They love him as dearly as their lives. If something happens, they might even bury you alive! Why would you take up such a hot potato?”

Ning Xi wasn’t happy upon hearing this, “What nonsense are you saying? What hot potato? My Little Treasure is so cute!”

Jiang Muye sneered, “I see that you’ve been mesmerised by someone’s looks! The moment he had a request for you, you immediately forgot about everything else!”

Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him impatiently, “Fine fine. Stop nagging already, would you? Did you think that I would dare to reject the Great Demon King Lu’s request? If it had been you, would you have dared to? Look at how afraid you are now, are you so worried that I’ll become your aunt?”

“A…Aunt…” Jiang Muye had been rendered completely speechless by the word ‘aunt’; he was in so much pain that he couldn’t speak anymore.

“Good boy!” Ning Xi patted a certain doggy’s head, and immediately skipped off after taking advantage.

Taking up her bag and explaining to the rest of the crew that she wasn’t free for the activities later that night, Ning Xi said her goodbyes and left.

Watching the girl’s figure hurriedly leaving the scene, a thick layer of frost gathered on Jiang Muye’s face.
