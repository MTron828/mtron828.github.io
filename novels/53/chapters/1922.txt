It was a meaningful kiss, a kiss of salvation as if the light from the creator of all things shone upon the Phantom’s closed up soul.

Finally, the Phantom was convinced by Christine’s determined love.

At the last moment, thanks to the kiss, he finally understood that true love was not about imprisonment or taking.

The Phantom backed off and turned around to avoid the girl’s gaze. At the same time, he let go of the noose around Raoul’s neck.

After a while, he raised up his hands and waved to Christine and Raoul, signaling them to leave.

Christine and Raoul rushed towards each other in disbelief.

In the end, Christine ran towards the Phantom, taking the ring he gave her off and returning it to him.

The Phantom looked down at his palm and slowly closed it. The ring was wrapped inside, then step by step, slowly, he walked towards the throne on the stage alone. He looked at the lovers leaving as he wailed on his own.

“I’m so empty without you.

What happened? You left me

I’m sorry, I don’t know what to do.

I’m trying to continue but it’s so difficult.

Is it my fault or this is just a game?

I can’t believe that you’d leave me,

I can’t stand it even if it’s just for a day.

I can’t forget about you.

This pain is crumbling me because we’re finished.

I just want you to come back, I need you to come back

But I let you go

Now everything has ended…”

The music faded away and darkness returned to the stage once again.

There was a huge rock in everyone’s heart, making it hard to breathe.

In the last scene, after many years, Christine passed away. When Raoul visited her grave, he noticed a black rose with a piece of black lace tied to it on the grave.

The end.

Until the end of the performance, the audience was still immersed in the storyline and was not able to react.

After some time, a thundering round of applause was heard. The applause lasted for some time.

The host came back on stage after finding the right timing. “That was unexpected! Ning Xi and Jiang Muye brought us such a big surprise. The lovely singing of the female lead, Qin Shuang, surely gave us a huge impact. What a visual feast for everyone! Now, let’s have our three leads up on stage!”

With the host’s voice of excitement, Qin Shuang and Jiang Muye went on stage one after another, still wearing their stage outfits.

In the opera, each and every outfit worn by Qin Shuang were extremely beautiful and significantly raised points on her tiny face. A bonus point was that during her performance with the two famous artistes Ning Xi and Jiang Muye, she seemed unfazed and put up an extraordinary show. This instantly created a strong impression of her on everyone.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Many people were already searching about her on the Internet.

As for Jiang Muye’s role today, if the Phantom was known to be the devil, Raoul would be the angel.

He was a royal, yet he fell in love with his childhood friend, who was an orphan that grew up in the opera house.

He loved her and went up to the rooftop to confess to her. He even went down into the grave to awaken her, ignoring his own safety to save her from the prison. Lastly, at the door of life and death, he told her to not sacrifice her life for him.

The Phantom was crazy for Christine, but Raoul was willing to sacrifice his own life for Christine’s happiness.
