Chapter 135: He Prepared a Woman

Zhu Xiangcheng had heard that there was a drinking party for business tonight, and that Lu Tingxiao would be there.

He had rushed over early and even specially made some preparations. In the end, it was exactly as he expected. Lu Tingxiao rejected all his overtures.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Lu Tingxiao hadn’t even glanced at the priceless antique calligraphy scroll that he had bought through no easy means. He even brought a fresh and bright virgin girl and hinted at giving her to him, but his expression was the same as if he were looking at some vegetables.

Just as he was getting anxious, the call he had been waiting for finally came.

“Hello, why are you only calling me now? Have you done it yet?”

“Yes, we’ve done it. We’re on the way!”

“Hurry up! Bring that person over in 10 minutes! The room is 808, don’t get it wrong!”

“Please rest assured! We’ll definitely send her over on time! This girl’s quite pretty, even me and my brother are a little aroused!”

“If you dare to touch her, then don’t even think about getting the rest of the money! I have uses for that woman! Not a single hair on her head must be missing!”

……

Not far away, Lu Tingxiao was sitting on a high chair. He looked at the time on his watch and adjusted his sleeves before standing up. From the looks of it, he was preparing to say his goodbyes and leave.

At this moment, a man suddenly burst out of the pool with a toss of his hair, creating a refreshing splash of water. His tan skin looked healthy and alluring, and he had beautiful six-pack abs and a V-line that countless men would die for…

The man raised his arrogant and handsome face, his dripping wet hand grabbed onto Lu Tingxiao’s calf just as he was about to walk away. With an unhappy tone, he said, “Hey hey hey, Lu Tingxiao, I was the one who called for this gathering today, can you give me some face? You’re leaving after just half an hour ? We’re here for a drinking party and you didn’t even have a sip of alcohol after coming here! We have fine wine and beauties here, can nothing make you stay a while longer?”

“Let go.” Lu Tingxiao frowned. He looked as if he was about to step on that man’s hands in the next moment.

At this moment, Lu Jingli walked over from behind, carrying a wineglass in his hands. He smiled and said, “Tian-ge, haven’t you seen that my bro’s heart completely isn’t even here tonight? Staying for half an hour is already giving you face!”

Mo Lingtian leaned on the pool’s edge with a devil-may-care smile on his face, “If his heart isn’t here, then where is it? He doesn’t have a woman!”

Lu Jingli looked like he was prepared to shock him as he snorted, “Who said that he doesn’t? He’ll have one soon!”

“What! That’s too much!” Mo Lingtian was shocked, as expected. With a splash, he jumped out from the pool, his face full of betrayal and anger, “Didn’t we agree that we would be bros for life? The one who first gets a girl is a dog!”

Lu Tingxiao cast a sideways glance at him expressionlessly, “I don’t remember ever agreeing to something so pointless.”

Lu Jingli couldn’t help but spit out, “Tian-ge, you’ve chosen to walk a solitary path so you can choose to flirt however you want, but my bro has a son. He has to find a mother for his child!”

“Who’s the woman?” Mo Lingtian frowned as he asked.

Lu Tingxiao looked at his watch again. His expression was already extremely impatient. He then strode outside quickly and completely ignored them.

“Damn! He actually ignored me! What happened to bros before hoes!” Mo Lingtian scolded from behind.

Lu Tingxiao had left, so Lu Jingli followed behind. Compared to a boring drinking party, he wanted to see how his bro tried to pick up girls.

“Hehehe, Bro, you’re rushing back to celebrate Sister-in-law’s birthday, right? Do tell what surprises you’ve prepared for her! I’ll help you judge them!”

Lu Jingli jabbered on as he followed behind Lu Tingxiao, when a fatty came charging out of nowhere.

“CEO Lu! Second Young Master!” The newcomer was sweating like a pig. From the looks of it, he had come running after them.

Lu Jingli raised an eyebrow, “Ya, Chairman Zhu! What are you in such a hurry for?”

“I, I’m looking for CEO Lu!” Zhu Xiangcheng looked at Lu Tingxiao, face full of flattery. He used both hands to hand over a thin, gold room keycard, “CEO Lu, this is a little gift from me, please accept it!”

It was clear that he had prepared a woman in the room for Lu Tingxiao.
