Ning Xi gently toasted his glass with the beer in her hands. She showed a smile that came from the depths of her heart, “Thank you!”

The moment the girl’s smile blossomed, Lu Tingxiao shook subtly for a moment.

Ning Xi looked towards little bun at the side, “I’m especially grateful to Little Treasure, I wouldn’t have been able to make it to the audition in time if it weren’t for him! Here darling, let me toast you!”

Little Treasure looked at his cup of milk, then at Ning Xi and Daddy’s beers. Although reluctant, he finally raised his cup to toast with Ning Xi. He then downed the rest of the milk in one gulp.

Ning Xi couldn’t help but laugh at his serious demeanour. He probably knows how to act like an adult drowning their sorrows in drink too?

Lu Tingxiao went to the balcony to take a call halfway through the meal.

Ning Xi immediately pressed close to Little Treasure’s side. She handed her beer over to him, “Heh heh! Curious about the taste? Quickly, taste it while your dad isn’t here! You can only have a small mouthful though!”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Little Treasure’s eyes lit up like stars in the night sky, he lowered his head and carefully took a small sip.

He felt extremely happy even though the taste was horrible.

Ning Xi immediately sat up when Lu Tingxiao returned from his call, acting as if nothing had happened.

Little Treasure was even more professional. He slowly drank his milk, completely unflustered.

Lu Tingxiao looked as if he had not noticed anything, but a glimmer of warmth flashed in his eyes as he sat down with a normal expression.

The three of them had good appetites. They managed to finish everything even though she bought a lot of ingredients.

Ning Xi was thinking it was time for them so leave as it was getting quite late. Suddenly, lightning flashed across the sky. Shortly after, thunder started booming loudly and fierce winds started to blow outside…..

“I saw that the weather forecast predicted heavy rain and typhoon for tonight…..”

Ning Xi stared at the pouring rain outside the window with a troubled expression. Little bun and Lu Tingxiao both looked at Ning Xi…..

After getting stared at by the pair, Ning Xi could only say, “Going back with Little Treasure at this time is a little dangerous since it’s already this late and the weather isn’t looking too favourable. Maybe you could stay over here for tonight?”

She had extended the offer purely out of courtesy, she thought there was no way Lu Tingxiao would agree. The result being……

Lu Tingxiao: “Okay.”

Little bun nodded.

WHAT!? why did you agree again……

Lu Tingxiao was way too easy going!

Why did she have a feeling the pair had just been waiting for her to make the offer?

She was going crazy!!!

Just like that, Lu Tingxiao and Little Treasure were going to stay over in the end.

The apartment that her company had arranged for her was not that large, it only had a living room and a bedroom. The sleeping arrangements were indeed a problem.

“I’ll sleep in the living room for tonight. Mr Lu, is it okay if you sleep with Little Treasure in my room? I’ll go change the bedsheets…..”

“No, I’ll sleep in the living room, you should sleep with Little Treasure in the bedroom.” Lu Tingxiao stated with a tone that would not accept any protest.

Ning Xi felt that she was digging holes for herself. Not only had she invited CEO Lu to eat a cheap hotpot, she was even making him sleep in the living room.

She wouldn’t have let Lu Tingxiao stay if he were the only one here. Especially after what Lu Tingxiao had said in the day, and it being only the two of them under the same roof.

Out of consideration of little bun however, she didn’t have a choice.

It was too dangerous to let him bring a child back in this weather. It couldn’t be considered a couple left alone together since little bun was here…..right?

Ning Xi could only resign herself to her fate, “I’ll see if I can find a change of clothes for both of you……”

She was able to find a change of clothes for them after rummaging through her closet.
