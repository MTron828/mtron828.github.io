Chapter 125: Little Bun is Angry

Jiang Muye had a headache, “But what about the movies that I’m still in the middle of filming… don’t tell me that I have to cancel them?”

Lei Ming muttered to himself for a moment before stating his analysis, “Not necessarily. 《Land Under Heaven》is a movie set in ancient times, so there’ll be many large scenes. It’ll take a longer period of time to finish filming the whole movie as well. I can negotiate with the director to have your scenes all pushed to the end, and we’ll take responsibility for any possible losses within this period of time. I’m sure Guo Qisheng will agree to this.”

Jiang Muye scratched his head in frustration, “It looks like that’s all we can do. Damn it, why does it seem like everything’s going wrong lately? That collaboration with HN should have been finalised, so nothing could possibly have gone wrong with it. It even hailed while filming a kissing scene in the middle of summer…”

The more he spoke, the more he started to feel that something wasn’t right. Finally, Jiang Muye punched his mattress, “Shit! Lu Tingxiao! Aren’t you too shameless——”Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

……

In the Lu residence.

Seeing daddy bringing a drunk Auntie Xiao Xi home, Little Treasure’s expression was full of reproach and accusation.

Lu Tingxiao placed Ning Xi on the bed before he met his son’s gaze and raised an eyebrow as he explained: “I wasn’t the one who made her drink.”

Little Treasure’s face still held reproach and accusation.

Lu Tingxiao was helpless, “Fine, it was still my fault that I didn’t take proper care of her.”

Seeing daddy’s sincere attitude, Little Treasure finally rescinded his unhappy gaze. He trotted over to the bathroom, and within moments, he came out with a warm towel. He removed his shoes, climbed onto the bed in one movement, then carefully kneeled by Ning Xi’s side and wiped her face for her. When he was done with her face, he moved on to wipe her hands. Little Treasure looked extremely attentive and earnest.

Seeing his son acting like a filial child, while Lu Tingxiao was gratified, he also felt like sighing at the same time.

He had never been able to receive such treatment even as Little Treasure’s very own dad.

“Ooh… my head hurts…”

The little bun’s heart ached when he heard Ning Xi’s groans of pain. He hurriedly leaned over and tried to blow away the pain from Ning Xi’s head.

A glint flashed through Lu Tingxiao’s eyes. He looked at his son and said, “This is part of your Auntie Xiao Xi’s work, I can’t interfere with it. However, if it’s you, you could try to persuade her to try her best to drink less from now on. She listens to you.”

The little bun felt rather pleased hearing that. With a serious expression on his face, he nodded, indicating that he was accepting this very important mission.

The next morning.

Upon waking up, Ning Xi saw the little bun leaning by her bedside, with a severe expression on his little face. He looked extremely unhappy.

Ning Xi hurriedly sat up, “Uh, darling, what happened? Did something bad happen? Look at your expression! You look just like your dad!”

Saying so, she pinched his little face, finding it adorable.

The little bun quickly took out a writing pad from behind him, then started to flip through the pages one by one.

Ning Xi saw that the little bun had drawn a few educational comics. Using pictures and words, he had illustrated the harm that drinking alcohol did to the heart, blood, bones, stomach, pancreas and liver, etc. one by one…

After he had finished flipping through the pages, the little bun stared at her with a strict gaze, his meaning clear.

Ning Xi coughed lightly, “Uh, that, darling… Actually, alcohol isn’t as terrible as you might think. It can lower the levels of harmful cholesterol, raise your self-confidence, activate your brain’s power, and even manage your weight…”

Holding up her fingers, Ning Xi started counting. Although she knew that the little bun was only concerned for her, she couldn’t just promise the child something without being able to fulfill the promise. How could she avoid drinking in her industry?

Upon hearing this, the little bun’s black eyes were filled with anger and disappointment. With a turn of his head, he ran out of the room.

“Hey, don’t go…” Ning Xi scratched her head awkwardly.
