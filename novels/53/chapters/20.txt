Chapter 21: Little Treasure Makes a Ruckus at the Palace

Little Treasure loved his silence. He would normally hide in his room by himself when he was done eating. The household staff had to return their rooms immediately after completing their tasks. They couldn’t make any sound or it would disturb Little Treasure; making him irritable or even lose control.

Madam Lu had previously sent some snacks to his room worried that he wasn’t eating enough. But Little Treasure locked himself up in the attic…

Thus, no matter how much their parents loved Little Treasure, they didn’t dare to move in with Tingxiao and Jingli.

Yet Little Treasure had actually taken the initiative to come out?

Not only that, but Little Treasure ran towards Lu Tingxiao and hugged his leg.

Lu Jingli laughed out loud, “Little Treasure, what are you doing? Hugging for some allowance?”

Lu Tingxiao lowered his head to look at his son and was able to tell what he wanted in a single glance. He rejected it without any hesitation, “No, you already went over last night.”

Thus Little Treasure’s gaze landed on his phone.

“You already called once during dinner.” Lu Tingxiao rejected him again.

Lu Jingli finally understood after watching from the side. The little guy missed Ning Xi.

Seeing that he couldn’t persuade his father, Little Treasure trotted over to Lu Jingli and reused the same move; he clung onto his uncle’s legs.

Lu Jingli was overwhelmed by the honour, “No no no, precious, don’t use this move with me. You know that your uncle can’t stand up to your cuteness!”

Little Treasure usually looked dazed. The moment he wanted to plead for something, his little expression and presence could make you die of cuteness and then revive.

He tilted his small head and used that pair of big, beautiful, shining star-like eyes to look. One wouldn’t be able to resist plucking all the stars from the sky to give to him.

The only one in the family who could resist this move would be Lu Tingxiao.

Lu Jingli shrugged helplessly, “There’s no use in acting cute with me Little Treasure, I can’t win your dad!”

Little Treasure immediately let go of Lu Jingli.

Absolutely cold-hearted.

Lu Jingli held onto the wall and laughed non-stop seeing the little guy looking as if he had been beaten black and blue by his parents, “Ah, you actually don’t have to be this anxious Little Treasure. There’s an old phrase, if the love between couples is true, then absence will only make the heart grow fonder! Wait until your dad marries Xiao Xi auntie. Then you’ll be able to see her everyday!“Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

His persuasion failed.

The little guy trotted to the door, slammed it open and ran out.

Lu Jingli shrugged, “What should we do?”

“He ate a lot tonight.” Lu Tingxiao said.

The meaning in his words was that Little Treasure could currently not use the absolute tactic, a hunger strike.

Lu Jingli calmed down after hearing his brother say so.

However, they had really underestimated Little Treasure…

He was a child, he didn’t need any tactics or plans. He only needed to make a ruckus.

A huge bang sounded from the living room as they had just finished speaking.

Lu Jingli exchanged gazes with his brother and the two hurried downstairs.

The living room downstairs had already been trashed within such a short amount of time. An ancient flower vase in the corner that was as tall as a person had already been pushed to the floor and shattered. Everything that could be pushed over or broken had already met a similar fate…

“Lu Qingyu!”

Lu Tingxiao would only call Little Treasure’s full name when he was truly angry.

Even Lu Jingli couldn’t stand that frightful presence once it was released, let alone Little Treasure.

Little Treasure started shaking scared by his father’s dreadful expression. His emotions got even more out of control. He screamed at the top of his lungs as he ran everywhere breaking everything he could get his hands on.

Lu Jingli hastily followed closely behind, yet he didn’t dare to follow too closely. The consequences would be terrible if they accidentally fell, since there were so many shards on the ground.
