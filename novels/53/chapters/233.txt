Chapter 234: Protecting Love And Justice

Translator: Henyee  Editor: Henyee

This woman didn’t want money or valuables. Then why the hell was she messing with him?

He really was so unlucky to have met a screwball like this!

But he didn’t know, the worse was yet to come…

Ning Xi suddenly thought of something, and patted herself on her head. She reminded the woman on the phone: “Ah, that’s right, later I’ll send you a recording of him and his trash friends talking, it’ll prove that he’s having an affair!

Why on earth wouldn’t you want money out of the divorce? Did you knock your head on something? Get what you should get, and not a cent less! Understand?”

“Yes… yes, I understand!”The woman was in awe of Ning Xi’s aura, and she replied subconsciously.

Ning Xi nodded in satisfaction, then said in a lecturing tone, “Yup, that should be the way. With money, you can look for any guy you want. Even if you encounter some that are not sincere, in any case, you can still keep a harem of studs and boy toys! And if they don’t listen to you anymore, you can kick them out anytime! Wouldn’t that be nice?”

Woman: “…”

scumbag: “…”

Not far away, Lu Jingli: “…!!!” He actually felt that sister-in-law’s words were reasonable…

Lu Tingxiao: “…”

The woman on the other end of the line was still utterly puzzled, and couldn’t help asking: “Thank you! But, who… who on earth are you? Why are you helping me? Have we met?”

Ning Xi smiled at the phone’s webcam “No need to thank me, you can just call me Lei Feng 1 !”

Saying this, she ended the call, kicked the scumbag aside, then turned and left abruptly…

Lu Jingli’s jaw had dropped in stunned amazement. “Brother, there are some things that shouldn’t be said, but I have to… sister-in-law is so f***ing cool, ahhhh! I’m completely falling…” in love with her!

Lu Tingxiao wasn’t in the mood to deal with an overexcited Lu Jingli. He knitted his eyebrows tiredly, and there were traces on his face of him having just survived a disaster.

Lu Jingli looked at his brother admiringly. “Brother, you are amazing. If you hadn’t endured it, we would’ve missed such a great show!”

After saying that, Lu Jingli seemed to think of something, and he said with extreme excitement, “Talking about this, I suddenly remembered something; I was only able to get a list of names of the people Ning Xi had dated back then. But they were all trash, without exception. Furthermore, in the end, it was Ning Xi who dumped them. If you take Jiang Muye into account, and the fact that Jiang Muye always tries to avoid talking about the time they dated each other…

“I wonder if the reason she dated those trash men was similar to what she did today. Trap them, then carry out heaven’s punishment, , protecting love and justice…”

Lu Jingli sounded like he had just discovered something big, but Lu Tingxiao’s expression showed that he wasn’t the slightest bit moved.

He had never believed that she was that type of person.

And even if she had been, it didn’t matter to him.

Ning Xi hummed a tune as she rode her motorbike. She felt refreshed, so refreshed, after beating up that scumbag.

As expected, torturing a trash man was the best way to destress!

Ning Xi glanced at the time on her watch. It was four in the morning, still too early, she needed to wait until at least six o’clock before she returned.

Then way, she could coincidentally bump into Lu Tingxiao in the living room…𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

And so, Ning Xi took a turn and headed west.

Half an hour later, she arrived at a river bank.

After she parked her motorbike, she sat down on the soft grass.

Just nice, the cool breeze would sober her up in the cool breeze…

And there was another good point about this location, which was… it had lots of mosquitos!

Ning Xi lay down and chanted to herself, “Mosquito, mosquito… it’s meal time, come bite me…”
