Chapter 176: I Want to Change My CompanyCheckk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At the reception.

When Chang Li saw that Ning Xi had finally arrived, she gloated in a very predictable manner, “Our big celebrity Ning has finally decided to grace us with her presence! You’ve certainly made me wait for a long time!”

While speaking, she shot a funny look at the stern man walking next to Ning Xi. “Who is this? Don’t you know that you’re not allowed to bring outsiders into the company as you like?”

Ning Xi gave Chang Li a sideways glance, “My lawyer.”

“Hoh! You even have a lawyer!” Chang Li assumed that Ning Xi had just casually hired one for appearances’ sake, so she snorted disdainfully. “I can’t believe that you’re still being unreasonable and putting on airs in front of me even though we’ve reached this point. Haven’t you realised how big a mess you’ve made this time around? If I hadn’t kept pleading with the company to go easy on you, you would have been cut loose long ago!”

Ning Xi raised an eyebrow and laughed lightly, “Heh, you pled on my behalf? I’d like to know what resulted from your pleas. Chang-jie?”

Chang Li threw a document at her, “The company will hold a press conference soon. As long as you issue a public apology at the press conference and voluntarily withdraw from the cast of 《Land Under Heaven》, Xueluo is generously willing to drop any legal action against you and give you a chance to turn over a new leaf. However, even if I try to guarantee your good behaviour from now on, there probably won’t be any production that would dare to use an actress with such a wicked character.”

After threatening her with the stick, Chang Li then switched gears to give her the carrot. Wearing an earnest expression, she spoke, “Don’t lose heart. The company won’t cast you aside if you truly repent. You should know that some directors don’t care about scandals. As a matter of fact, I’ve already accepted another role on your behalf. As long as you cooperate, there’s a chance that you’ll be able to make a comeback!”

Ning Xi looked at her with a faint smile and spoke softly, “A big production huh… I wonder which project Chang-jie has accepted on my behalf?”

Seeing that Ning Xi had taken the bait, Chang Li sneered at her before replying. “What, are you scared that I’ll screw you over? You must have heard of 《Blooming Like It’s Spring》 before, right?”

Ning Xi’s finger tapped idly against the armrest, “Jiang Penghai’s new project?”

“That’s right! It’s by Director Jiang! You should know that every single one of Director Jiang’s movies has become a box office hit. When he was making movies in Hong Kong, Guo Qisheng wasn’t even on the radar yet!”

Ning Xi almost couldn’t resist the urge to laugh out loud while listening to Chang Li’s earnest praise for Jiang Penghai. A sharp glint suddenly flashed through her eyes, “Chang-jie, if you want me to sell myself, you can just tell it to me straight! There’s no need to beat around the bush!”

Jiang Penghai had started his career by shooting pornography. Later on, he had tried to clean up his image but he wasn’t very successful. The part that most people took issue with was Jiang Penghai’s behaviour.

This guy was extremely lecherous and he had slept with almost all of the actresses who starred in his productions. Last year, he had almost been taken to court because he had relations with a minor.

She really had to thank them for going the extra mile to find a role like this for her. It must have been a lot of trouble finding a big production with such an illustrious director at the helm.

Chang Li frowned after hearing Ning Xi speak, “What do you mean, I want you to sell yourself?! Isn’t the rating just a little more on the mature side?! What, you’re not willing to do it? If not for my recommendation, they wouldn’t necessarily be willing to take in trash like you! Just think about how much of a loss you’ve caused the company this time around! Are you thinking of freeloading off the company if you can’t land any roles?”

“Sorry, but I won’t be accepting this role.” Ning Xi didn’t feel like listening to Chang Li as she continued to reach new lows, so she simply stated her refusal outright.

Chang Li flared up on the spot and slammed the table with force, “Ning Xi, you’ve been disobeying me time and time again! Are you so stuck up that you won’t even listen to your manager anymore? I’m telling you now, you’re going to act in Director Jiang’s movie, even if you don’t want to!”

“My manager?” Ning Xi sneered, “That’s a title you won’t be holding any longer.”

“Haha, you’re still trying to change managers? You’ll have to see if anyone in Starlight is brave enough to take you on!” Chang Li said fearlessly.

“What I want to change is the company.”
