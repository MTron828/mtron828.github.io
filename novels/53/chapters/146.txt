Chapter 147: Little Treasure Destroys the House

Ning Xi, what should I do…

I’m not as good as you think I am.

Sometimes, I’m really scared when you look at me with such trusting eyes.

What if a day comes when you find out that I’m not like how you think I am… will you leave me then?

……

In the early morning, at about 5am, Lu Tingxiao was woken by the sound of a doorbell.

When he opened the door, he saw an anxious Lu Jingli standing outside, “Bro, don’t scold me first! It’s a real emergency this time! If you don’t go home right now, Little Treasure is going to destroy the house! They couldn’t contact you or Ning Xi, so they could only call me!”

At this moment, Ning Xi spoke from behind, clearly having just awoken, “What happened to Little Treasure? I’ll go back right now!”

Having said so, she took up her bag and even helped Lu Tingxiao pack his things in ten seconds, “Quick, let’s go!”

The three of them quickly rushed back to the Lu residence.

When they entered the compound, Ning Xi stared blankly.

“What kind of situation is this! What are those?” There were shiny, silvery white humanoid figures walking around chaotically all over the place. Ning Xi rubbed her eyes and stared at the scene with astonishment, feeling as if she had just stepped into a parallel dimension.

Lu Jingli blinked, “Can’t you tell? They’re robots!”

Ning Xi was about to go crazy, “Of course I can tell… but, why are there so many robots?”

Lu Jingli was about to have a headache, “This is one of Little Treasure’s hobbies. It’s been awhile since he has taken them out to play with. Isn’t this great? The moment he got agitated, he let all of them out. It looks like we’ve just stepped into a fortress besieged by zombies…”

In the area within their sights, there were already more than twenty robots wreaking havoc everywhere.

Digging into the ground, running around crazily, crashing into trees, trampling on flowers… One of them even picked up a maid… Accompanying all this was the screams of the servants. The entire scene was a huge mess…

Seeing that the maid was about to fall from the hands of the robot, Ning Xi quickly opened the car door and ran over, managing to catch the maid before she crashed into the ground.

“Are you alright, Wanwan?”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Wanwan patted her chest, still frightened. She then turned to look at Ning Xi in gratitude, “Thank you Miss Xi! Miss Xi, you’ve come back! Quickly, go find the little young master!”

In the Lu residence, all the servants, especially the female ones, were cautious and unaccepting of Ning Xi, but they just didn’t dare to show it in front of her. It was only Wanwan who had more interaction with her after regularly sending Little Treasure’s handmade fruit juice to her while she was on set. Wanwan had a good impression of her after seeing that Ning Xi didn’t use the eldest young master and the little young master’s doting affection to bully the servants, and even had a modest and humble attitude.

After watching Ning Xi nimbly save the damsel in distress, Lu Tingxiao, who was still in the car, had a begrudging expression.

Lu Jingli stuck his head out of the car window and bawled resentfully, “Xiao Xi Xi, you’re not supposed to do that! You took my role! Ow! Help me——”

As he was speaking, one of his arms got grabbed by a robot.

“Bro, save me! Turn this thing off quickly!” Lu Jingli, who had just been howling about missing the chance to play the hero, was requesting for help himself.

Lu Tingxiao looked at him as if he wanted to help, but was unable to, “Little Treasure altered his program since the last time, I need an hour to crack it.”

“One hour! My arm’s going to break by then! Ah ah ah, it hurts, ow, ow…”

“Where’s Little Treasure now?” Ning Xi hurriedly asked.

“He should be in the control room.” Lu Tingxiao quickly got out of the car. “I’ll bring you there.”

“Okay!” The two of them hurriedly ran towards the control room.

Lu Jingli watched their disappearing figures with expectation, “Make it quick!”
