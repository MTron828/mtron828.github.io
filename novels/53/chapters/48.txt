Ning Xi held her forehead and paced aggressively, “I’m not going to mention sending flowers to prank me for now, but you know that the news of your return has already been leaked. The media and your fans will be flooding the airport! You want me to pick you up? You want me to be torn up by them? Jiang Muye, I only dumped you once! It’s not worth giving me such a hard time!”

“Am I giving you a hard time? This is a free opportunity for you to become famous, something so many stars want but can’t even get!”

“I. Don’t. Need. It!”

“Fine! You’re not coming, are you? Then I’ll tell the whole world that you dumped me! Anyway I don’t care if I’m humiliated, I want to let everyone carry out justice for me!” The other person said shamelessly.

“You…” Ning Xi’s lungs were about to burst from anger. The stupidest thing she had ever done in her whole life was provoking a troublemaker like Jiang Muye.

Did you think I wouldn’t be able to deal with your cheap tricks?

The corner of Ning Xi’s mouth raised slightly as she chuckled, “Sure, you want me to fetch you? I’ll go! Just don’t regret it when the time comes!”

Actually, it was easy enough to settle the matter with Jiang Muye. He was just unhappy about being dumped for the first time, so he wanted to take a little petty revenge. He would stop once he had enough. The thing that made her head hurt was the devil that had sent the diamond.

Forget it, forget it. She wasn’t going to bother with it until she had to!

“Ning Xi, there’s someone looking–”

She heard the errand boy Xiao Li’s pressurising voice the moment she came out of the corner, and she was so frightened she wanted to drop everything and run.

Who was it this time?

Will this ever end!?

Everyone in the crew was suddenly full of energy, was there going to be something even more explosive this time?

In the corner, Cui Caijing’s expression was full of disdain, “These crude men only now how to throw out money! They’re so low class!”

“Miss Xi, h-hello!” This time, it was a shy girl. Seeing that Ning Xi’s expression wasn’t too good, she even thought that she had done something wrong, and looked apprehensive.

Facing a girl like that, Ning Xi couldn’t vent her rage no matter how angry she was, “No, it’s nothing. Are you looking for me?”

“I’m here to send you something.” The girl opened up something white that looked like a thermos. Cool white mist floated out, revealing three bottles that looked like they contained fruit juice: red, yellow and green.

“This is…?” The corner of Ning Xi’s mouth twitched. She had seen too many palace dramas, so her first reaction was that someone was trying to poison her.

“This was personally made by my little young master. There’s watermelon juice, orange juice and green bean soup.” The girl replied.

“Who’s your little young master?” Ning Xi was suspicious, and tried to recall if there were any little young masters who liked making fruit juice amongst the people she had offended.

The girl indicated that she should read the note on the bottles.

Ning Xi tore it off for a look, only to see an English word written on the note: ‘fighting’, with a heart shape drawn on the end.

She could almost imagine the sender’s shy expression, with pursed lips as he drew the heart.

“So it’s Little Treasure…” Ning Xi’s gaze turned gentle in an instant, and her turbulent emotions finally calmed down.

At first, she had been worried about being too high-profile at the start of her career and drawing unwanted trouble and gossip.

Now that she thought about it, why should she care so much about the gazes of the people who didn’t care about her? If she had to keep caring about what other people thought of her in this industry, wouldn’t she die from exhaustion?

Back then, she had cared too much about what the upper class socialites had thought about her, even as their gazes looked down on her. She had cared too much about her supposed biological parents’ attitude towards her, and had regarded Su Yan’s opinion too highly. It had caused her to feel even more inferior as time passed, and she had slowly lost her identity…

She had already understood this philosophy long ago, yet she had let a small incident shake her heart so much.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She only had to be herself, keep a clear conscience, and one day, she would be able to prove herself with her own strength.

She was fighting only for the people who cared about her.
