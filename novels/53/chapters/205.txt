Chapter 206: The Truth Comes Out

Translator: Henyee  Editor: Henyee

Liang Feixing was so shocked that he didn’t even noticed his glass had fallen over and the water splashed everywhere…

He finally understood; no wonder the Big Boss himself had asked about Ning Xi so late at night. Ning Xi and Lu Jingli had that kind of relationship?Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

In her mind, Ning Xi beat Lu Jingli 100 times; outwardly, her smile was so stiff that her face looked paralyzed. “Young Master, I can’t tonight, I made plans with friends. I’ll have to take a rain check!”

Then, in a natural manner, she turned to Liang Feixing, Ling Zhizhi, and said, “Director Liang, Sister Ling, Lawyer Chen, if you’re available, do join us! I once claimed to be a good cook and Young Master kept it in mind all this time. He is always asking me to cook for him to express my gratitude; I can’t let him keep all the good stuff to himself! Thank you all so much for today! Thank you!”

After she finished, bowed deeply.

Just like that, Ning Xi was able to resolve all the embarrassing misunderstandings with just a few words.

Ling Zhizhi nodded in appreciation and thought that this artiste was good at crisis management. She had also done well in the press conference, she was indeed a good investment.

As for her relationship with Lu Jingli, it seemed easily to misunderstood, but there was obviously no chemistry between the two. They should just be very close friends.

…

Regal Riveria Hotel, Ning Xueluo’s apartment.

Su Yan brought nutritious food on his early morning visit. After some sweet talk, Su Yan looked at the time and turned on the TV.

On the screen, the Glory World Entertainment Press Conference had just started and Lu Jingli was introducing Ning Xi as a new member of the company.

Ning Xueluo hadn’t slept at all, she had to put on a thick layer of makeup just to cover the dark circles under her eyes. She’d stayed awake to see the live broadcast, but didn’t expect Su Yan’s arrival.

She didn’t know what would happen, so she didn’t want to watch it with Su Yan.

Ning Xueluo clung to Su Yan’s arm like a little girl. “Brother Yan, what’s so good about watching TV, pay attention to me instead! Let’s do something else?”

Su Yan patted her hand and continued to watch the screen attentively. “Xueluo, be quiet.”

“Brother Yan, why do you care so much about Ning Xi?” Ning Xueluo pretended to be jealous of her.

“Don’t you care? You don’t want to know what the conference is about?”

“I…” Ning Xueluo choked. “Of course I care about Xiao Xi! I just don’t like that you’re giving her all your attention!”

“Ok, don’t act like a child. Be quiet and watch with me.” Su Yan was abnormally firm about it.

Ning Xueluo gnashed her teeth and could only sit there like she was sitting on needles, watching the broadcast.

Ling Zhizhi was explaining Leng Manyun’s decision to retire from the entertainment industry, then a reporter stood up and asked why Glory World wanted to sign on Ning Xi.

Ning Xueluo’s heart was in her throat, she wished the situation would descend into chaos and end poorly.

Unfortunately, this was a Glory World event. Even if the journalists wanted to make a scene, they wouldn’t be able to voice more than a few complaints.

Ning Xueluo cautiously watched Su Yan’s reaction, but realized that Su Yan’s eyes never once left Ning Xi, even though Ning Xi didn’t say a word throughout the whole process.

Ning Xueluo suddenly felt danger approaching; at the same time, the lawyer clicked his mouse and a familiar voice started to play…

It was Zhang Qiang’s voice!!!

Ning Xueluo’s heart sped up and she comforted herself non-stop. Even with Zhang Qiang’s testimony, Ning Xi would only be able to prove herself innocent. Nobody would find out that she, NIng Xueluo, was the one behind everything.

What happened next, however… smashed her hopes one by one…
