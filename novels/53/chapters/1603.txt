After she was finished, she returned to herself almost instantly. She stood up and bowed to the judges.

Jiang Xingzhou gazed at her as though he was about to say something, but in the end, he merely said, “That’s all.”

Ning Xi responded with a slight nod and left the room, her eyes dark.

She had probably failed…

After the audition ended, Ning Xi was walking around aimlessly when a white car suddenly halted beside her.

“Xiao Xi!”

Ning Xi came back to her senses when she heard Song Lin’s voice. “Senior Song!”

“Want to grab a drink?” Song Lin invited.

Ning Xi was not really in the mood, but since her goddess had invited her after all, she nodded.

Song Lin brought her to a members-only music bar. There were not a lot of people inside and soothing music was being played, adding to the really pleasant atmosphere.

“What do you want to drink?” Song Lin asked.

“I don’t mind anything.”

“Then, shall I order for you?”

“Mmm.” Ning Xi nodded.

Song Lin smiled when she saw the girl’s obedient air. “How’s the audition today? Are you confident?”

Ning Xi looked a little awkward, but she still answered genuinely, “To be honest, I’m not really confident. There were a lot of strong competitors and my performance was, at best, average…”

Song Lin looked at her squarely in the eye. “Not at all. Your performance before was definitely above average, but…”

Song Lin made a pause, then she continued, “While it was good, the chances of getting this character at that level aren’t very high.”

Ning Xi looked like she expected that answer. She had not analyzed it properly when she first accepted the script. She only realized her fatal issue after she studied it back at home and had been trying to resolve the issue on her own, yet… during the audition, she had still failed…

“Actually, I’ve prepared myself for this. I’ll try again next time!” Ning Xi smiled reassuringly.

The waiter sent the two cocktails Song Lin had ordered over.

Song Lin took a sip and looked at the girl. “Why?”

Ning Xi was confused when she heard Song Lin’s question. “What?”Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Why did you hide your acting skills deliberately?” Song Lin asked.

Ning Xi was a little taken aback when she heard Song Lin’s direct question and she felt a little helpless inside.

As expected of Senior Song. She could not hide from her after all.

“You’re overestimating me, Sis Lin. I’ve already given it my all,” Ning Xi replied.

Song Lin thought about it, then she spoke again as she rested her chin on her hand. “Let me rephrase myself. You’re worried about something, so you didn’t perform at your level best. I don’t think that was your best…”

Ning Xi felt really troubled.

Actually, her performance today was pretty solid, from just the perspective of acting.

However, her fatal mistake was that she had not put any emotion in at all. There was no resonance and she had not really immersed herself into the scene.

A normal person might not be able to see through it, but people like Jiang Xingzhou and Song Lin were able to identify it at first glance, especially the latter. He was really particular about emotions in acting and must have been really unsatisfied with her acting.

“Is someone threatening you?” Song Lin asked.

Ning Xi shook her head. “No, it’s my own problem.”
