Ning Xueluo immediately switched to a bashful expression upon seeing Su Yan, “It was because of you tiring me out!”

“You… You were clearly the one seducing me!” Su Yan had a helpless expression. Following that, he held up the plastic bags he was carrying, “I bought chicken porridge for you so that you can regain your strength. Don’t keep saying that you’re tired now!”

“You’re so annoying!”

……

The next scene followed closely after the previous one. It was a battle in the bamboo forest.

Upon seeing that Meng Changge had already gone crazy and wouldn’t listen to reason, after a moment of hesitation, Shangguan Yingrong was prepared to kill her to avoid trouble later on.

After the martial arts instructor taught them for more than two hours, the two of them were almost done learning the moves.

The director had been prepared to find stunt doubles for them at first, but since Ning Xi was rather good at martial arts and had even been a stunt double before, she definitely didn’t need one. Ning Xueluo had then indicated that she wanted to try the scene herself.

Guo Qisheng naturally wanted the best effect for the movie, so he had agreed.

The professional stunt master helped to set them up in their rigs. After checking a few times and confirming that everything was set up properly, filming started.

“Meng Changge is already dead.” Shangguan Yingrong shut her eyes and spoke with heartache and regret.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The person standing in front of her was just a beautiful and dangerous shell, a weapon that was going to destroy this kingdom.

In the next second, murderous intent surged up in Shangguan Yingrong’s eyes. At the same time, she drew the sword at her waist and charged towards Meng Changge…

As if she had already predicted Shangguan Yingrong’s actions, Meng Changge stood calmly on the spot. It wasn’t until the sword was already inches away from her nose that she moved. Just by stretching out both arms and touching the ground with the tips of her toes, she flew backwards like a bird and avoided Shangguan Yingrong’s attack.

Shangguan Yingrong breathed out coldly and took up her sword again.

Meng Changge took her time to dodge Shangguan Yingrong’s attacks. It was like a cat toying with a mouse. Finally, she casually drew the sword she carried on the waist of her red dress and started to counterattack with fierce moves.

After just ten or so moves, Shangguan Yingrong was on the losing end. She was almost pushed off the bamboo branches a few times.

Even though Shangguan Yingrong had some skill with the sword, she was like an infant before the mighty general who had slain entire armies, Meng Changge.

Shangguan Yingrong had overestimated herself. She had thought that Meng Changge’s skills would have rusted away after concealing herself in the palace for so long. Who would have thought that she wasn’t even a match for Meng Changge? However, it was already too late when she realised that she had underestimated her enemy.

In the end, Meng Changge finally had enough of playing around. Her gaze turned chilly as her sword pierced straight towards Shangguan Yingrong’s chest with the force of ten thousand soldiers…

Shirk–

It was the sound of a sharp blade entering a body.

Shangguan Yingrong held onto her chest, pain written all over her face. Like a kite with a broken string, she tumbled from the sky above the sea of bamboo…

Next, there was supposed to be a close-up featuring Meng Changge’s expression. Guo Qisheng was watching Ning Xi’s performance with rapt attention, but found that there was something wrong with Ning Xi’s expression.

“Ning Xueluo is hurt! Save her! Quickly!” Still suspended in midair on wires, Ning Xi suddenly shouted.

After everyone froze blankly for a moment, they realised that that wasn’t a line and that Ning Xueluo was really hurt!

The set turned into a frenzied mess as everyone surrounded Ning Xueluo.

After being let down from the wire, Ning Xi hurriedly pressed down on the wound on Ning Xueluo’s chest that was spewing blood, “Quick, call the ambulance!”

Right after she finished speaking, she was suddenly pushed away with great force. Su Yan flew over, pale with fright. He carried Ning Xueluo in his arms tightly, “Xueluo! Xueluo! What happened to you?”

“Yan-gege… It hurts so much…”

“Don’t be scared, I’m here! You’ll be fine! You’ll definitely be alright…”
