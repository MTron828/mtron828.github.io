Chapter 220: Want To Go Out And Have Fun

Translator: Henyee  Editor: Henyee

[It’s better to keep our dignity and beauty rather than care about the treachery or unkindness of others. That which can’t kill us will in the end make us stronger!]

There were a lot of people who slept late on Weibo, and the number of forwards and likes on her post climbed rapidly.

Less than five minutes after she posted, Jiang Muye also forwarded it with a decent message of support.

Below the forward, the fans were too excited they cried. The couple in the movie had actually entered the same company in reality — then wasn’t there even more of a chance of something happening between them?

To Ning Xi’s surprise, among the hot comments below her Weibo post, in addition to caring for and supporting her as well as gossiping about her and Jiang Muye, the most popular comment on the top of the list was unexpectedly —

[Goddess, goddess! Lu Tingxiao actually forwarded the Weibo message about you last time! Have you ever seen Big Boss Lu at Glory World Entertainment? Have you ever spoken to him? Is he handsome or not, handsome or not! Begging for photos! Begging for fortune!]

Ning Xi’s head was covered in black lines. “Have I ever seen Big Boss Lu? Of course I’ve seen him! He’s lying next to me, you silly human! Send photos? Forget it! A male god must of course be kept to one’s self…”

Ning Xi muttered to herself as she continued to browse online. As a result, the more she looked, the more energetic she became.

Ai, she shouldn’t have browsed Weibo when she couldn’t sleep.

What she needed now was a book on advanced mathematics!

As she fretted, there was an incoming call, the caller ID showing that it was Jiang Muye. Fortunately, she had put her phone on silent.

Ning Xi accepted the call and lowered her voice. “Hey. What do you want?

“I was also going to ask you, why aren’t you asleep yet, so late at night?”

Ning Xi rolled her eyes. “I could say the same to you —”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Why is your voice so low?” Jiang Muye asked suspiciously.

“Do you want me to shout at you so late at night?”

“Something’s off…” Jiang Muye said in a firm tone, like he was Sherlock Holmes. “There’s someone next to you!”

Hearing this, Ning Xi cursed in her heart, then said with conviction, “I’m sleeping with Little Bun. How? Do you need to be so surprised?”

“Really?”

Ning Xi suddenly felt that the hand on the waist seemed to have tightened a bit, and she almost lost concentration. She hurriedly replied, “If not, then what? Can the person lying beside me be Lu Tingxiao? You’re too paranoid!”

Jiang Muye curled his lip, also figuring that he was thinking too much himself. “I was just asking!”

“By the way…” Ning Xi suddenly thought of something, and frowned. “How’s your family situation?”

Jiang Muye was silent for a while, and then replied: “Almost resolved already. After I met with you last night, that partner who had been refusing to let go all this time suddenly relented. This is really a coincidence!”

Meaning, Lu Tingxiao had obviously guessed something…

“Then that’s good.” Ning Xi was relieved. “Then are you free tomorrow?”

Jiang Muye snorted. “Why? I’m very busy!”

“Oh, then forget it.” Saying that, Ning Xi was about to hang up the phone.

“Wait, I’ll be free tomorrow. What do you want?” Jiang Muye hurriedly asked.

Ning Xi said slowly, “It’s going to be autumn tomorrow. The weather’s great and just nice, I don’t need to shoot scenes. Want to go out and have fun for a bit?”

“What?” Jiang Muye’s first thought was that he had heard wrong. After all, she had seen him as a bringer of misfortune since his return from abroad, and had been avoiding him. “What… what are you plotting?”

“Why do you have so many questions? If you’re not going, let’s forget it!”

“Going!”
