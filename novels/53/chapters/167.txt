Chapter 168: Pampering Her A Little More

“I got that evidence myself, okay! But Lu Tingxiao did help me out a lot later on.”

“Alright, I get it. It’s good that you’re okay. I’m hanging up! Remember to look at my email!” Keeping in consideration that she was still sick, Jiang Muye restrained his temper. Since he didn’t have the mood to ask about how Lu Tingxiao had saved the damsel in distress, he just hung up after speaking in a forceful tone.

Damnit! If that Lu Tingxiao hadn’t used some underhanded means to stall him, he would be by her side right now. He should be the one helping her through all those difficulties!

Shameless, so shameless!Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Was that Jiang Muye?” Lu Tingxiao casually asked.

“It was! He asked if I needed any help! He even said he sent me an email, I wonder what it is? He keeps reminding me to look at it, acting all mysterious. It’s probably some birthday prank. He did the same last year, when he sent me a really scary prank video. I was so angry I had to beat him up three times before I finally vented all my anger…”

Ning Xi mumbled her complaints. She wasn’t in any hurry to look at the email. She continued looking through her text messages and missed calls to see if there was anyone else she needed to reply.

Most of the missed calls were from unfamiliar numbers, and were most probably from the media. When she reached the end of the call log, she saw a familiar name. The missed call had been made on her birthday.

Looking at those two words, Ning Xi’s indifferent expression turned warm, “I thought he forgot my birthday!”

“Who is it?” Lu Tingxiao subconsciously turned tense.

“My little brother, Tang Nuo.”

Lu Tingxiao nodded and relaxed without any change in his expression.

He thought it would be her ex. He was about to turn into someone who jumped at every new person appearing in her life.

Ning Xi immediately called him back, “Hello, Xiao Nuo~”

“Jie, you finally called me back! How are you doing now? Are you okay? Did those people make trouble for you? I saw the news in the papers…”

“Don’t worry, I’m fine!”

“But I saw that that woman is trying to sue you!”

“I’m not an easy target, we’ll see who’s going to be the one getting sued in the end!”

“You’re really fine?”

“I’m really fine! If you continue worrying so much, I’ll start suspecting that you’re 70 instead of 17!” Ning Xi paused for a moment, “But, you’re believing me just like that? What if I really lost my mind and purposely stabbed Ning Xueluo to get her role?”

The young teen’s voice sounded clear and bright even through the phone: “Why would I believe in others before believing my own dear sister?”

Warmth spread in Ning Xi’s heart upon hearing this, “You little brat! What a sweet talker!”

“I’ll stop worrying now that I know you’re fine. Oh yeah, I haven’t wished you a happy birthday, and it’s already passed…”

“It’s fine, it’s the same even if you say it now. Thank you, my dear, handsome, sweet little brother~”

“Stop being so mushy! I’m not going to talk to you anymore, school is about to start, I have to finish my summer homework!”

“Alright, go go! Work hard, young un!”

After the call, Ning Xi was in high spirits.

Seeing how happy she was, Lu Tingxiao’s mood lifted together with hers, “You have a good relationship with your brother?”

“Yeah! Although we’re not related by blood, we’ve always gotten along very well together. I told you that my grandmother valued males more than females when I was young, right? Back then, if there was any good food around, only Xiao Nuo was allowed to eat it. I wouldn’t even be allowed to eat at the table. However, Xiao Nuo would always hide some of it for me to eat. Whenever Grandmother found me an eyesore and tried to cause trouble for me, he would jump out to protect me. He’s a really good kid!”

As she spoke, Ning Xi’s spirits seemed to dampen, “Isn’t it strange? The ones I’m actually related to treat me like a sworn enemy, but someone I’m not related to at all treats me like family. I should have realised that benefits always outweigh kinship in those circles…”

Lu Tingxiao gently patted the girl’s lowered head, “You’ll find better family.”

Each time he heard her speak of her childhood, he couldn’t resist pampering her a little more, as if doing so would make up for everything she had missed out on.
