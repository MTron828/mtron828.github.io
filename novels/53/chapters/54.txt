Chapter 55: Everyone Wants to Teach Him to Flirt

He had once asked Qin Mufeng what it felt like to be in love with someone, and Qin Mufeng had said, “You’ll know once you meet that person.”

Back then, he had thought that those words were full of nothing.

It was only when he met Ning Xi that he finally realised that they had been true.

“Congratulations! You should know that many asexuals never meet someone like that in their whole lives!” Qin Mufeng sincerely congratulated his old friend.

Other than heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality, there was another sexual orientation in this world called asexuality.

Being asexual didn’t mean that they had some sort of physical condition or that their sexual orientation was undetermined, and it also wasn’t due to fear of intimate relations. Simply put, it was ‘disinterest towards sexual love’.

It was due to this ‘illness’ that his mother had urged Lu Jingli to drug him five years ago…

“This could be called ‘fortune comes in pairs’. So, when do I get to drink wine at your wedding?” Qin Mufeng teased.

“I’m working on it.” When it came to this topic, a thread of unease appeared on Lu Tingxiao’s face. He was too used to things sailing smoothly.

Qin Mufeng was surprised, “You mean you’re still working on it? I thought that with the great CEO Lu at work, it was already a done deal. A girl that can attract you is indeed different from most! So this time you’ve come looking for me to get me to teach you how to chase a girl? Although my practical experience pales in comparison to Jingli, I’m pretty good at theory!”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Why was it that everyone wanted to teach him how to woo girls?

Lu Tingxiao’s expression turned black, “That’s unnecessary. I called you here to confirm the influence her appearance has had on Little Treasure.”

Once he was done with the jokes, Qin Mufeng got down to business, “It’s like this, there are two sides to every matter. Although this is a good thing, as you’ve said earlier, Little Treasure wrecked the house just for the sake of meeting her. So the most important thing to do is to see how to guide him.”

“It doesn’t matter whether you did it for selfish reasons or not, temporarily keeping her here is the right thing to do. For the next step, I suggest that you get that girl to help out. Bring Little Treasure out for walks more often, and when the time is right, you can even send him to school. Let him start living a normal life step by step. I spent two years and never managed to do it, but maybe she’ll be able to…”

“Understood, I’ll try it.”

……

In the movie city.

The moment Ning Xi entered the set, the whispers in the surroundings immediately stopped, and everyone stared at her with strange expressions.?

It seemed like the rumours had already spread.

In the corner, someone whispered in a peculiar tone, “What’s this, she’s just a rookie and yet she came in so late. Doesn’t she see that Teacher Ning is already here?”

Actually, it wasn’t that Ning Xi had come late, but Ning Xueluo had come too early.

“Teacher Ning, you’re in the same company as Ning Xi, are those rumours spreading online true?”

“Someone even said that she slept with a lot of people in our crew for the sake of getting this role!”

“That’s too shameless! Doesn’t Starlight care about this kind of dishonest competition?”

……

Facing the crowd’s questions, faint helplessness appeared on Ning Xueluo’s face as she sighed, “We each use our own abilities, so the company won’t care…”

After saying so, she seemed to have realised that she had said something wrong and quickly added on, “I mean that my junior didn’t really do those things, you can’t trust rumours on the internet!”

However, it became even more conspicuous when she tried to cover it up, which made everyone even more sure that the rumours were true.

It wasn’t until the director came over to urge everyone to start work that the idle gossipers dispersed.

The pure and innocent look on Ning Xueluo’s face also faded instantly, and she called over the assistant at the side, inquiring in a low voice, “How’s the task I assigned to you?”

“Xueluo-jie, don’t worry, everything has been prepared! Didn’t you say that she’s allergic to metal? I put metal powder in the makeup artist’s kit when no one was looking, her whole face is going to be ruined…”
