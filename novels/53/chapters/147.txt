Chapter 148: Just Carry Me

After a moment, Lu Tingxiao called the butler to prepare an open top golf cart and quickly brought her to a small detached building behind the golf course.

This building had an extremely weird shape; from the texture, it seemed to be made from some unknown metal. At one glance, it looked especially high-tech and futuristic.

The Lu residence was too large, Ning Xi had never seen every single part of it despite staying for so long. This was the first time she had visited this building.

“There’s some machinery installed in the base of this building so that it turns with the sun. The outer walls are made of solar panels, while the electricity inside comes from solar energy. The butler and maids are all robots.” Lu Tingxiao fulfilled his role as a tour guide as he explained.

“How cool!” Ning Xi’s face was lit up, showing child-like excitement.

“If you like it, you can come over to play. I’ll set up access rights for you later on. You didn’t seem very interested in this kind of thing previously, so I never brought you over.” Lu Tingxiao said.

“Not at all! I love this kind of thing! When I was young, I always dreamed that I would be taken away by a spaceship some day! When I grew up, I even thought about dating a robot! Ah, it feels so romantic just thinking about it!”

Lu Tingxiao: “…” Perhaps it would be better not to give her access rights.

The pair walked to the entrance only to see a robot lying on the ground. Its eyes suddenly lit up red, as if scanning Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao.

When the scan hit Lu Tingxiao, the robot struggled and made ‘zzt’ sounds, “Master… Master…”

This poor robot that kept calling for its ‘master’, looking like it wanted to report something but was unable to speak, was most likely the butler for this building.

Lu Tingxiao sighed and opened the panel on the back of the robot. It seemed like he pressed something, before the robot’s eyes turned dark and it stopped moving.

Ning Xi anxiously moved closer and touched it, “Why isn’t it moving anymore? It’s not dead, is it? Oh, wait… I mean, it’s not going to be scrapped, is it?”

“It’s fine, it’ll be fine after repairs later on.”

Ning Xi relaxed, “Oh, then that’s good. It would be such a waste otherwise, this one’s rather handsome!”

Lu Tingxiao: “…” Then it should just be scrapped.

After a scan of his face, he entered the main building. Ning Xi followed behind, looking around anxiously, “Where’s Little Treasure?”

The main hall was filled with robots who were patrolling about. Once they found Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao, they turned as one and faced them.

Following that, they completely ignored Lu Tingxiao and started charging towards Ning Xi.

“AHHHH! What are they doing? Why are they all charging towards me!” Ning Xi was frightened. No matter how good her martial arts were, surely she couldn’t possibly beat a steel wall of robots?

Lu Tingxiao’s arms reached under her arms and easily lifted her from one side to another, successfully dodging the robotic claws of one of the robots. With a helpless tone, he said, “It’s because you don’t have access rights; they’re treating you as an intruder.”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Then what should we do now?” In the time it took for her to say that, Ning Xi had already been swung about by Lu Tingxiao a few times.

“Get closer to me.” Lu Tingxiao ordered.

“Ah! How much closer?” Ning Xi was at a loss.

“Little Treasure is in the control room on the top floor. Right now, we have two choices. One, we beat them and charge in.”

“How are we supposed to beat so many robots! What’s the second choice?” Just looking at the material of the robots made her hands hurt. She didn’t want to start beating them up!

“Two…” Lu Tingxiao lowered his gaze and looked at her, “I carry you all the way up, because they won’t attack me.”

Ning Xi blinked, then reached her arms towards him without hesitation, “Carry me.”
