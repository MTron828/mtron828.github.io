Chapter 87: You Need a Woman

Ning Xi spoke in a light tone, “If I can’t even handle little problems like these, how will I survive in the entertainment industry? Didn’t you tell me previously that you believed in me?”

“Well, your current appearance doesn’t look very convincing.” Lu Tingxiao’s expression was grave.

Ning Xi was puzzled by his words until she remembered the makeup on her face. She explained, “I made my skin this pale and drew these dark eyebags on myself. I’m really not pretending to be strong. I can take off my makeup if you don’t believe me…”

Before she finished speaking, Lu Tingxiao suddenly reached out and his fingertips softly grazed against her cheeks and eyes.

Although it was only a light touch, Ning Xi looked as if she had been shocked by electricity. She couldn’t help but tremble a bit.

Ning Xi’s reaction caused Lu Tingxiao’s face to darken slightly. He quickly retracted his hand and spoke, “You’re not allowed to push yourself.”

Ning Xi smiled in reply, “I won’t. If I can’t deal with this, I’ll definitely fly back here and hug your leg!”

Having been soothed, Lu Tingxiao relaxed somewhat. “Okay.”

Following that, Ning Xi scratched her head as she looked at him, looking like she wanted to speak but was holding back.

“Did you want to say something?” Lu Tingxiao asked in a gentle tone, as if the person last night had been a completely different person.

Ning Xi stared at him with a complicated expression for a long time. Finally, she couldn’t help but speak up, “Uh, um, Lu Tingxiao, have you ever thought of finding a woman to keep you company?”

“What are you trying to say?” Lu Tingxiao’s expression immediately turned cold.

“Don’t blame me for sticking my nose into your business. I just think…” Ning Xi considered her words carefully and then patted his shoulders with sincerity, “I think you may need a woman. For some matters, restraining yourself isn’t good for your health!”

Wasn’t there a common saying that went, one dreams at night what one thinks during the day?

On the surface, Lu Tingxiao didn’t appear to be fazed by a woman’s charms, but judging from his display last night, he clearly…really seemed to need it…

At this point, Lu Tingxiao’s expression was completely dark.

Damned woman, who do you think is at fault here? Who do you think is forcing me to restrain myself so miserably when the treat is already so temptingly close?

Seeing that Lu Tingxiao’s complexion was worsening, Ning Xi coughed awkwardly and quickly slipped away, “Since time is running out, I’ll go say goodbye to Little Treasure and head off to the set! Bye bye~”

At the movie city on the outskirts of the capital.

Just as Ning Xi appeared, a crowd of Jiang Muye’s fans waiting by the entrance immediately rushed toward her with fury.

“Ning Xi! Ning Xi has arrived! That damn prostitute has arrived! She actually dared to appear!”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Evil bitch! You’re not allowed to get close to our Muye! Hurry up and get lost from this production!”

“Ning Xi get lost from this production! Ning Xi get lost from the entertainment industry! Get lost from here!

……

The scene was filled with chaos. Only a few security guards protected Ning Xi as she walked inside. The rest of the production crew stood around and watched the show. From time to time, they would point at her and laugh while sneering with laughter.

Those stares were like daggers, cutting into her one by one. Those looks of malice were like a fierce and ferocious viper trying to tear her into shreds.

Ning Xi couldn’t help but recall that back in the day, there was a really popular female celebrity who had ultimately been forced to commit suicide due to gossip. After she died, her suicide note contained only five words: Gossip is a dreadful thing!

The crowd continuously threw rotten eggs and spoiled vegetables. Some random person even threw a rock, although the rock was thrown askew…

When she saw that the rock was going to hit the makeup artist Amy, who was currently spectating, Ning Xi’s expression changed and she quickly leapt forward. Right as the rock reached half a meter from Amy, she used her arm to block it.

In the next second, the part of her arm that had been hit was drenched with blood.
