Chapter 180: I’ll Help You Count the Spoils

This felt completely like the emperor, Lu Tingxiao, had sent a grand official to help a poor citizen, Ning Xi, with the case of a pig being stolen…

“Just in case.” Lu Tingxiao replied with an unperturbed expression.

Anything that had to do with her wasn’t a small matter at all.

Ning Xi didn’t want to say anything anymore, the great demon king always did things removed from common sense.

“Have you finished looking through the contract I passed to you this morning?” Lu Tingxiao asked.

Ning Xi ran a hand through her hair, “It was so thick, I felt dizzy just reading it. Anyway, I glanced through most of it and I’ve already signed it. I’ll pass it back to you later!”

Lu Tingxiao frowned slightly, “You’re so trusting towards me?”

Ning Xi shrugged: “I’ll even help you count the spoils if you sell me off!”

Lu Tingxiao smiled with a doting expression.

Lu Jingli: “…” Ow, my single dog eyes! I’m going blind from all these displays of affection! It’s becoming impossible to live in this house.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“If no surprises pop up, you can report at the company the day after. You rest at home for a day tomorrow.”

“Okay, that’s great!” Ning Xi nodded.

Lu Jingli wanted to smash his head against something after hearing that. The day after? Didn’t that mean he only had one day to convince Lin Zhizhi?

How heartless of his bro!

Lu Tingxiao seemed to have seen through Lu Jingli’s inner complaints. He turned to his little brother and said: “After you complete this task, you can go on holiday.”

“Awright! I’ll go right now!” Lu Jingli recovered all his spirit.

……

That night, in a VIP ward in the First People’s Hospital.

Ning Xueluo was staring dead-on at the woman on the TV screen.

Outside Starlight’s office building, despite disappearing for so many days, Ning Xi didn’t look weak or haggard at all. Conversely, she looked radiant and practically glowed from the inside. Surrounded on all sides by five bodyguards in black, she faced the reporters’ attacks with a domineering expression: “Firstly, I’m innocent, so I don’t have to give myself up. There’s also no reason for me to feel ashamed.”

“Secondly, the truth for Jia Qingqing’s incident has already been made clear, please don’t try to obscure the facts and mislead the public, otherwise that’s slander!”

“Thirdly, I have terminated my contract with Starlight, just a few minutes ago. However, I was the one to initiate the termination and they weren’t the ones to cancel my contract.”

“Lastly, if they want to blacklist me, then I’d like to see them try!”

When she heard Ning Xi’s last words, Ning Xueluo abruptly threw the desk lamp by her side at the screen. After the impact, the screen fizzled and some smoke rose off the top of it, before it went completely dark.

“Chang Li! What’s the meaning of this? It was enough that Cui Caijing committed such a low-level mistake, but now even you’re making mistakes? What did I tell you? You absolutely can’t let her terminate her contract!”

Ning Xueluo was the kind of person who would react to problems by scolding others. Chang Li was used to Ning Xueluo’s personality, but even so, her expression turned a little ugly now, “I’ve already told you long ago. With Ning Xi’s looks, if she managed to find a backer with power and money, I wouldn’t be able to keep her suppressed any longer! Since you forced her to that point, this kind of result is within our expectations…”

“Then are you telling me to just watch her change her fortunes just like that? I paid such a huge price! And even spent 8 million yuan for nothing!” Ning Xueluo was in hysteria, unable to accept their plans failing for the umpteenth time.

“Xueluo, it’s not as bad as you think. Ning Xi’s reputation has already been completely ruined in the entertainment circle. Even if she found a backer, she can’t recover her reputation anymore. Besides, who would dare to use an artiste that our Starlight has blacklisted? Her career in this industry has come to an end!”

“Not only that, just think about it, she caused such a ruckus this time and simply tossed out 8 million yuan just like that. She was even picked up by bodyguards and a branded car; is there anyone in the world who wouldn’t be able to tell that she’s being kept? How would the Ning family even be able to accept her? Can she even enter high society like that?”

After listening up to this point, Ning Xueluo’s anger had finally subsided a little, “Have you sent orders to the fan army?”

“Don’t worry! When this happened, I already sent orders down to them. Besides, even if we don’t do anything, those reporters will surely frame things that way!” Chang Li was absolutely confident.
