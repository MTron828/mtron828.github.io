Chapter 2126: Don’t Make Me Hate You

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Ning Xi finished, then she took a long look at Little Treasure inside the ward through the window pane. She walked right up to Annie. “Begin!”

“Do you want to die?!” Ning Xi had just steadied herself when Yun Shen pulled her away.

Ning Xi fought back and pulled away from Yun Shen’s grip. “Don’t get in my way!”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“F*ck!” Yun Shen was so angry that he stared with fire in his eyes towards Lu Tingxiao beside him. “Do you still have a say in this?”

Lu Tingxiao’s thin lips pursed, he looked extremely miserable. “Xiao Xi…”

The man was about to speak when Ning Xi interrupted him, “Lu Tignxiao, don’t make me hate you!”

Lu Tingxiao instantly turned pale and he could not utter a word.

Next, Ning Xi’s eyes swept across everyone who was there. “No one is allowed to do anything!”

She was running out of time already!

Then, she immediately looked to Annie and commanded, “Annie, begin!”

“Okay!”

Annie walked step by step to the girl. Her figure struck Ning Xi at the speed of lgiht.

“Pfft!!!” Ning Xi’s entire body was like a kite that had its string cut. She flew quite a few meters away and hit the cold wall hard. Then, she spat out a mouthful of blood on the spot.

“Little Junior Sister!”

“Xiao Xi!”

Everyone cried out in alarm.

Ning Xi held out a hand and stopped everyone from going up to her. “I’m fine.”

Tang Lang was about to go crazy. What!? How could she be fine!? He had felt Annie’s blow and he understood her strength all too well!

“Continue!” Ning Xi staggered towards Annie.

Bam! Came another strike.

This time, Ning Xi was struck to the ground. She did not move at all as the blood from her mouth dripped onto the cold floor.

She used up all of her might before she could finally brace herself into kneeling halfway, then she wavered as she stood up again.

However, her figure looked like she would collapse any second now.

She definitely could not handle a third strike!

She would really die!

“Dumbass! Are you insane?!” Yun Shen could not hold back anymore and he started to rush up to Ning Xi.

Ning Xi shouted, “Lu Tingxiao, hold him back!”

Almost the instant Ning Xi said that, Lu Tingxiao held out his hand and blocked Yun Shen who was about to rush over.

Yun Shen looked at this man in disbelief. “F*ck! She’s going mad?! Are you being crazy with her too?”

Lu Tingxiao stood tall and unmoving in front of Yun Shen like a weathered thousand-year statue. He did not move, apeparing indestructible, yet in reality, he could be crushed into pieces in the next second…

While Lu Tingxiao held Yun Shen off, Ning Xi dragged her heavy footsteps as if she was lugging a mountain with her and she returned extremely slowly to Annie again. “Last hit.”

Annie did not say anything. She just stared at Ning Xi unmoving.

It was not sure how long had passed before Annie finally said, “Okay.”

Everyone’s hearts were in their throats. Tang Lang, Tang Ye, and Feng Xiaoxiao were all ready to charge in to stop her.

Finally, Annie made her move. That palm strike that seemed as if bore the force of a thunderbolt swiftly made its way towards Ning XI…

When Tang Lang and the rest noticed how powerful the force was, the speed of the strike was too quick and they were too late to stop it.

Thus, they could only watch helplessly as Ning Xi endure this blow…

The entire hospital corridors were dead silent.

Yet, in the next second…

The thing that they had expected to happen never happened.

As the strike landed, Ning Xi did not topple over!

Annie’s palm was close to Ning Xi’s chest area. With a closer look, one would realize that it looked like she had hit her but there was actually an extremely minute gap. She had not hit her.
