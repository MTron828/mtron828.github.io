Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In just a night, the shares were all bought up by a mysterious finance group.

If the Lu Corporation fell into the hands of an outsider, a virtual bubble economy would be formed. In a short amount of time, it would cause a reaction that could destroy the whole Chinese economy.

Lu Jingli had goosebumps all over him as he had these thoughts.

It was surely a conspiracy!

Not just the Lu Corporation, several other powerful organizations faced a similar fate as the Lu Corporation. It was exactly the same circumstances!

“This means that we are not the only target. The opponent wants to control the economy of the whole of Asia?!”

Lu Jingli stared at Lu Tingxiao in horror.

A huge amount of underground forces hid behind the economy of Asia. If the Asian economy was destroyed, handling the underground forces would be extremely easy. Whether it was to disband them or to use them, it would not be a difficult task.

“Just who could it be? I thought it was that Yun bastard again, but now that I think about it, that guy couldn’t have gone this far!” Lu Jingli’s brain was going haywire.

After a while, Lu Tingxiao blurted out two words, “European King.”

Lu Jingli was shocked when he heard those two words. “Damn… Seriously? We’re not even related in any way. What does that old guy want, stepping over his boundaries? And I feel that he’s especially against us this time!”

If the Lu Corporation could hang in there, the current situation could still be controlled. However, once the Lu Corporation fell, the consequences would be catastrophic.

The powerful organizations in the country would surely fall along with the Lu Corporation like a stack of dominos.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

It was worrisome enough to have Yun Shen around, then this external enemy had stormed right in…

…

At night, in a certain old house in Imperial.

In the dark came the cold voice of the white-haired man, “You’re really lucky, aren’t you, Uncle Qiao?”

Uncle Qiao’s expression was unusually calm when facing this person who had abandoned his duty for revenge and for his family. “Shen, you’ve been too obsessed. That woman bewitched you, so I can forgive you just this once.”

“Hahaha…” Yun Shen laughed as if he had just heard a joke.

“I’m giving you your last chance now. Work together with me. This is our only chance at overturning the Lu family!”

Yun Shen gazed upon the man. “It seems that your patron is pretty powerful this time. Why do you still need me?”

Qiao Yi was angered by his indifferent tone. “Bastard! Your mother is not avenged yet! And you’re here wasting your time. Think about it. What have you done in the past year?!”

“What did I do?” Yun Shen’s eyes brightened a little.

He did not really do anything in the past year, yet it was the time that he felt the most alive.

“I’m here to get you out of your slump!” Qiao Yi sounded determined.

Yun Shen guffawed. “Aren’t you afraid that I might betray you and help Lu Tingxiao, in the end ruining all your plans?”

“You dare to?!” Qiao Yi was frustrated when Yun Shen mentioned the one sensitive thing.

Yun Shen raised his eyebrows. “With your powerful patron around, does anything I do make a difference?”

“Good that you know! No matter what, the Lu family have to die this time! If you work with me, I can pretend that all those things from before never happened!”
