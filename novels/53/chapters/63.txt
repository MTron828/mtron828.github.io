Chapter 64: A Visitor in the Night

Jiang Muye set up the game with a practised hand, and even dug out a few packs of fruit jelly, potato chips and dried fish from who knows where. While humming, he brought out a bottle of good wine from his wine cellar.

When all preparations were done, he sat cross-legged on the floor and just as he was rolling up his sleeves and preparing to try out the game, the doorbell outside rang.

Jiang Muye’s face immediately darkened, but he didn’t open the door. With a fiery temper, he called Lei Ming, “Stop ringing! I’ll get there on time tomorrow, okay? You keep calling me back and forth like some animal, I can’t even play a game, do you believe that I’ll just quit right now…”

“Ah? What ringing are you talking about?” After getting shouted at for a long while, Lei Ming was utterly confused.

Jiang Muye immediately choked on his rant, “You’re not the one outside ringing my doorbell?”

“I’m already far away. In fact, I’m still driving!” Lei Ming was completely innocent.

“Then who could it be… Not many people know that I live here…” Jiang Muye mumbled suspiciously.

“It can’t be that your address has been leaked? Be careful, don’t open the door recklessly, what if it’s the media! Ning Xi is still over there!” Lei Ming immediately warned.

Jiang Muye scoffed and replied without a care, “So what if it’s the media! What’s going to happen even if they see her?”

Lei Ming was helpless, “Muye, I’m not trying to lecture you. Even if you’re trying to help her out of good intentions, the other party has to accept it! Ning Xi has already said she doesn’t want to get on your pirate ship…”

Jiang Muye immediately flared up, “What pirate ship! Who are you calling a pirate ship!”

The doorbell continued ringing. It rang once every five seconds, following a strict pattern.

“I’m not talking to you anymore, I’m going to open the door! Who could be visiting me at this late hour…” Jiang Muye hung up and walked towards the living room impatiently.

Jiang Muye specially looked at the CCTV to check who it was outside. The result: he was struck dumb and looked as if he had seen a ghost.

“Oh my god! It’s Lu Tingxiao!!! Why is he here…”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

At the main entrance, the man was wearing grey casual clothes and slippers holding something in his hands. Although he was dressed so casually, Jiang Muye could somehow feel a cold wind blowing from the tundra onto the back of his neck. It even sent shivers up his spine.

Jiang Muye was so panicked that he felt like running around in circles, like a bunny that had seen a wolf. It was only when the doorbell rang two more times that he took a deep breath and opened the door.

In the instant the door opened, the sloppy attitude from before had completely changed into a cautiously respectful manner, “Uh, how come you’re here…”

“I came to see you.” The man replied expressionlessly.

“Oh… please come in! Come in…” Jiang Muye quickly invited him in.

Lu Tingxiao’s gaze casually swept over the game controllers on the floor, snacks and wine, then sat on the sofa.

Noticing Lu Tingxiao’s line of sight, Jiang Muye coughed lightly and explained, “Uh, this job’s too tiring, it’s rare to get a break to relax.”

Lu Tingxiao wasn’t bothered by this. He spoke up, “When did you arrive?”

“Not too long ago.” Jiang Muye rummaged about for a long while before finally finding a teabag. However, he didn’t have any hot water, so he could only pick up a bottle of mineral water from the fridge, “I don’t have any hot water at home yet, is this okay?”

“No need, I’ll just sit for a while before I go.” Lu Tingxiao pointed at the few boxes he had brought over, “Your mother sent these.”

“Then just send someone to bring it over to me, there’s no need to trouble you to come personally so late at night!” Jiang Muye grumbled at his own dear mother a hundred times in his heart. Why send him over! Didn’t she know that he feared this person the most? Fine, there was no need to think, his mother had definitely sent this person to check up on him while clearly knowing that…
