Chapter 32: Troublesome Exes

“No, I think I must have seen wrongly…” Luckily, without waiting for Ning Xi’s answer, the reporter had already given up on his own question.

He had most likely recalled that Ning Xi was an artist from Starlight, how could Arthur be her stylist when he was the personal stylist for Golden Age’s Su Yimo?

Ning Xi heaved a huge sigh of relief. Worried that they would continue this line of questioning, she quickly spoke up to change the topic, “Since it’s the opening ceremony for ?Land Under Heaven?, it would be better if everyone asked questions related to the movie!”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Miss Ning, Miss Ning, is this your first time acting in a movie?” Someone in the crowd asked.

“Of course not, I’ve started acting since I graduated from university. However, I didn’t appear in a lot of movies, so you wouldn’t be able to recognise me.” Ning Xi replied honestly, not at all bothered by her sparse resume.

The media could easily get a hold of such details, thus it would be better to be upfront about it.

“So what has Miss Ning acted as previously?”

Although this question was quite normal, it was somewhat awkward for Ning Xi to answer. However, she had to give an answer since they had asked.

“I’ve acted as…” Ning Xi started to list the roles she had played since returning to China.

During the time she had been studying overseas, she had spent most of her free time acting in movies. She had even acted in a few famous dramas and played many roles. Having a resume like Ning Xi’s wasn’t easy considering how most movies overseas didn’t like using Chinese actors.

However, she could not bring up her experience overseas, because of her ridiculous dating history while she was overseas…

Although she had not done anything immoral and they had dated normally, the identities of her ex-boyfriends were all a little too eye-catching…

What she needed the most right now was a movie that she could openly claim she had starred in. If she was surrounded by the rumours of her love life the moment she entered the entertainment circle and the public was focused on her personal life, she might be able to gather a lot of attention and even become a hot topic overnight if she were lucky. However, it wouldn’t bode well for her long term growth.

Ning Xi was trying really hard to remember the roles she had acted since returning to China that she could mention openly. However, the reporters turned speechless upon hearing the list.

What kind of roles were these…

A mistress, a fox spirit, a demoness, a country girl, a brain-dead eldest miss, and even an evil old woman…

For a beauty such as her, what kind of interest is this?

Why did she like to choose roles like those?

Someone eventually asked, “Why do you keep playing antagonist roles?”

Ning Xi could not reveal Chang Li’s actions here, so she calmly spoke up, “Actually, I didn’t notice . Acting is a much beloved career for me, and every role has its own life. To me, there’s no distinction between big or small roles.”

Following that, the media asked more questions. Even though she didn’t have a manager to guide her, Ning Xi had answered them perfectly one by one.

Guo Qisheng kept nodding as he watched from the side, “This lady is doing really well! Despite having this kind of quality and EQ, she still hasn’t managed to make it big yet after entering the industry for a year… What do you think about this, Old Wang?”

The producer Wang Taihe said meaningfully, “If it’s not the upper ranks at Starlight Entertainment turning blind, then it’s…”

He gave him a ‘you know’ look after saying so.

It was clearly someone at Starlight purposely suppressing her.

Guo Qisheng’s face was full of pity and regret, “What a waste of such good talent!”

“Well, gold will always shine in the end. Failing that, doesn’t she have you?” Wang Taihe chuckled as he said.

At this moment, Ning Xueluo’s nails had dug into her palms and her expression had become so ugly that she was close to losing her composure on the red carpet.

She had purposely let Chang Li inform Ning Xi at the last minute to make her a laughing stock at the opening ceremony. However, she had never thought that it would result in her making a stunning appearance to the crowd instead.

Damn it, Ning Xi’s outfit alone cost several thousands, how in the world had she gotten this amount of money?

Clothing and accessories could be rented, but who did her styling?

She had underestimated this country girl!
