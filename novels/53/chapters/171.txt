Chapter 172: His Son Surpassed HimĐiscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

After hearing Ning Xi’s self-deprecating words, Little Treasure had decisively brought out the big guns…

Ning Xi was both touched and worried at the same time, “Lu Tingxiao, Little Treasure definitely inherited this from you. Isn’t he a little too good at making girls happy? What will we do when he grows up! I don’t even dare to imagine how much I’ll be wrapped around his little finger if he could talk!”

Especially that last line, it had poked her right in her soft spot.

He had actually called her a princess…

She had always wanted to become a queen, because that was the only way she could face all the tough and dangerous times she had gone through without fear.

When looking at the ‘princess’ word that Little Treasure had written, the young girl’s heart that had been buried deep within her had been drawn out…

Would any girl not want to be a carefree princess? She simply had no other choice.

Lu Tingxiao looked at his son with laments in his heart. This had already gone beyond inheritance: his son had already surpassed him.

Seeing Little Treasure standing there with a serious expression, looking up at her, Ning Xi could only chuckle helplessly before bending down to hug him, “Alright, alright! I get it! I know that I’m the most beautiful person in your eyes! I won’t undervalue myself from now on, okay?”

It was only then that Little Treasure was satisfied. Copying how she usually rewarded him, he placed a gentle kiss on her cheek.

Ning Xi couldn’t resist hugging the little bun and snuggling her cheek against his, “Ah, what should I do? I really want to steal you away when your dad isn’t looking!”

Little Treasure blinked a few times, and looked like he was looking forward to it. He even nodded in approval, as if saying: Hurry up and steal me away!

Ning Xi: “Pfft…”

Lu Tingxiao: “…” Why did he have the déjà vu of being a third wheel?

At the same time, in Ning Xueluo’s ward.

Since the reporters weren’t able to catch Ning Xi, they could only return to interviewing Ning Xueluo.

Everyone was going crazy looking for Ning Xi now, but she seemed to have evaporated off the face of this world. There wasn’t even a trace of information about her, the reporters couldn’t find her at her apartment, the set, or even her company.

If they found out that Ning Xi had been staying on the same level as Ning Xueluo, and had even had a brief encounter with them just now, they would probably go mad.

Out of concern for Ning Xueluo’s health, Su Yan interrupted them after they had asked a few more questions, “I’m sorry, everyone. Xueluo is still injured and her body’s still a little weak. Let’s stop today’s interview here!”

“Oh yes, my body isn’t too well. I’m sorry to disappoint everyone!”

Although the reporters weren’t too happy, they could only express their understanding and pass on their well wishes before leaving.

Chang Li escorted them out politely, “Thank you for your concern towards Xueluo, everyone. I believe that everyone understands what is just and fair, and that everyone has a measure in their heart. It wasn’t easy for all of you to come over on such a hot day, this is a little convenience fee for everyone’s efforts!”

After saying so, the assistant Cui Caijing started handing out red envelopes filled with money to each of them.

The reporters were well aware of what was going on. They each expressed that they would definitely demand justice for Ning Xueluo.

On the hospital bed, Ning Xueluo seemed to have thought of something as she displayed her suspicions on her face, “Yan-gege, what happened to the reporters just now? Why did all of them suddenly run outside? Did Ning Xi really come over?”

“It wasn’t. They got the wrong person.” Su Yan pulled her covers a little higher absent-mindedly.

Most of those reporters had never seen Ning Xi in person, but he was different. Just now, he had caught a blurry glimpse of that figure and she did look like Ning Xi. He was practically certain that she really was Ning Xi.

But how could that be possible? Why would Ning Xi be so intimate with a man, with a kid beside them?
