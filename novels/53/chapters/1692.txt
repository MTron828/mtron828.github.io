Chapter 1693: Mommy Won’t Let Bad Things Happen To You

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Ning Xi was on high alert at the moment. She was closely observing what was happening outside, but the two guards were like plastic models. She almost could not hear their breathing and no one else was coming. They did not reply to any of her questions as well.

Another half an hour passed, and Ning Xi’s expression darkened.

Only they were able to assemble a group of A-rank mercenaries to take a child away from the Lu family.

There would only be one reason for this. Lu Tingxiao must have started resisting, and they might have been pushed into a corner, so they wanted to use Little Treasure to threaten the Lu family.

She had thought of this angle from the start. Since they had demands, she was not really worried that they would hurt Little Treasure.

However, as time passed by, she felt like things were not right.

If they were trying to use Little Treasure to threaten the Lu family, they should have stated their demands to Lu Chongshan when they first abducted Little Treasure. Even if they missed the chance, they should have already contacted the Lu family by now. Their disadvantages would pile up as time went by.

Why did they not contact the Lu family?

Unless…

She hugged Little Treasure even tighter as she thought of a certain possibility.

After some time, there was the sound of footsteps outside the door.

The leader with the letter “K” on his mask was talking to the two guards.

Ning Xi’s sharp eyes saw shock on the face of one of the guards.

What had the “K” said that could cause such a reaction from him?

They did not seem to care that she was here and spoke in a loud voice. Ning Xi heard a few phrases, “tonight midnight”, “it’s an order from above”, “keep that woman”…

Ning Xi combined the phrases together and her blood froze.

He had specifically mentioned “keep that woman”. What did that mean?

Discard the child?

The sound of footsteps faded away as the leader left and silence returned again.

Ning Xi could not stop shivering.

“Mommy…” Little Treasure looked at his mother anxiously as he could tell that she was very shaken up by her emotions.

Ning Xi hugged him tightly. “It’s alright…”

It was alright… Nothing bad will happen…

Mommy will not let bad things happen to you!

Ning Xi did everything she could to calm herself down. Her expression changed the next moment. She clutched her stomach and had a painful expression on her face.

“Mommy?” The calm-looking Little Treasure had a change in expression as well when he saw what happened to Ning Xi. He looked over in alarm. “What’s happened, Mommy?”

Ning Xi could not say anything. Her body started twitching and she was groaning painfully.

The guard on the right side turned around and looked inside when he heard something. He frowned.

As he was about to act, the other guard stopped him. “What are you doing?”

“She…”

“Don’t do anything unnecessary,” his partner warned him.

The guard hesitated a little, then returned to his post.

After that, Ning Xi’s reaction gradually became stronger. She was rolling around in pain and was knocking her head against the wall. Blood streamed down her face.
