Chapter 857: That Guy Is Treating You This Way?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Lu Chongshan was slightly worried when he realized Little Treasure was about to present him with calligraphy art. Due to his achievements in the world of calligraphy, everyone’s expectations would be really high and in addition to the talented impression Little Treasure gave just a while ago, people might judge him harshly. However, the results were surprising and he was really glad! This surprise clearly made him much happier than Guan Rui’s priceless gift!

As the guests were praising the little bun, there was a loud and strong voice.

The crowd looked at the source of the voice. It was a middle-aged man in his military uniform who walked in from the entrance. The man looked boldly at the host. He was the general from the Zhuang family, Zhuang Liaoyuan!

“Chief Zhuang, welcome! Thank you for coming!” Lu Chongshan went up and greeted him with a smile.

“You’re welcome Elder Lu, I should apologize for being late!” Zhuang Liaoyuan replied.

“Official tasks are, of course, more important, please come in…”

…

Zhuang Liaoyuan walked towards the calligraphy Little Treasure had just created and hid none of his impressed expression. “This calligraphy, did your grandson write them?”

“Yes! It’s his his birthday present to me!” Lu Chongshan was feeling proud.

Zhuang Liaoyuan glanced at the little guy. “Impressive! He can write with this strength at such a young age! Elder Lu, this kid has inherited the talent from you!”

As Zhuang Liaoyuan was chatting to Lu Chongshan, he noticed Ning Xi who was beside Little Treasure, “You…”

Ning Xi recognized Zhuang Liaoyuan as well but it was not appropriate to talk to him at that time, so she looked down and pretend to not know him.

Zhuang Liaoyuan realized that she was in a maid’s uniform and noticed her submission, so he quickly concealed his surprise, but then his eyes turned icy when he looked at Lu Tingxiao.

The atmosphere got warmer as Zhuang Liaoyuan arrived. As expected of a man from another prestigious family, many people wanted to rub shoulders with him. Most importantly, families like his rarely interacted with rich businessmen and Lu Chongshan’s birthday was one of the few occasions that he would show up at, so it was a rare occasion indeed.

Guan Rui was tense. He knew that the Zhuangs intended to establish a marriage relationship with the Lus, so he had to see what his biggest competitor was thinking…

As the evening got later, the dinner ended and the guests were adjourning. Lu Tingxiao and Little Treasure sent the guests out while Ning Xi went to the garden for a small break.

As she sat on the swing, reminiscing Little Treasure’s cool moments of the night, she noticed someone was closing in, and judging from the sound of their footsteps, she could determine that it was someone with a martial arts background.

Ning Xi stood up and looked behind her alertly…

Her alertness became awkwardness.

It was Zhuang Liaoyuan!

Why did he come here? Was he here just to find her?

“So, that guy is treating you this way?” As Ning Xi was contemplating, Zhuang Liaoyuan suddenly spoke to her.

Zhuang Liaoyuan’s expression looked unhappy, even a little cold when he spoke.

Ning Xi was confused. “Uh…eh? Chief Zhuang, who are you talking about?”

Was he talking to himself?
