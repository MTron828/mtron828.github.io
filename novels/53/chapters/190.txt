Lu Jingli stared at her bitterly, “You idiot! How dare you! Give me back all the cauliflower, cabbage, turnip greens in your hands! These plants are all my own species, I personally water and fertilize them. Everyday I play music for them, read them stories, and tell them jokes. They’re my pride and joy! They’re a hundred times more precious than gold! You haven’t seen them grow as big or as juicy in anyone else’s home. Putting it in general cuisine would be such a waste!”

Ning Xi: “……?” She thought he was growing them because he wanted to eat them. Besides, she never thought that Lu Jingli would have such a fantastic hobby……

“Put them down immediately!”

Ning Xi blinked, “It’s too late! I’ve already picked them! Do you want me to give you money for them?”

“You actually dare to use money to insult my little babies! Ning Xi, I will fight you!” Lu Jingli rolled his sleeves up and started rushing towards her.

Ning Xi nervously pulled up Little Treasure, “Run” she shouted and the two ran away panting.

Ning Xi headed towards the house door and started calling, “Lu Ting Xiao! Help-“ “Welcome back, how did things go?” Lu Ting Xiao asked, coming out of the house.

Ning Xi immediately grabbed Little Treasure and hid behind him. Just then Lu Jingli arrived and started complaining. “Brother, you don’t know but those two naughty children in your family actually went to my vegetable gardens and stole my food!”

Lu Ting Xiao: “I sent them.”

Lu Jingli: “……” Really now, behind the naughty children is a naughty parent!

“You are too much!” Jingli shouted, “I don’t care how you do it but give my little babies back to me!”

Ning Xi poked her head out from behind Lu Ting Xiao’s back, “But your little babies are already dead!”

“You dare to say that?! I’ll bury them and pray for their salvation! Isn’t that enough?!”

“Well, I think eating them is also pretty good!”

“You, you, you……this cruel woman! I’m going to beat you and die with you!” the raging Lu Jingli started rushing over when suddenly a handsome robot appeared to block his way.

Standing behind the robot was Little Treasure looking coldly at Lu Jingli, as if warning him not to bully his Aunt Xiao Xi. Looking at the three children plus a robot ready to fight, Lu Ting Xiao pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. “Lu Jingli don’t cause trouble. Just come for dinner.”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I do not want…” Lu Jingli started but suddenly smelt the aroma of delicious food.

“…Brother, didn’t you make all the servants leave today? Then who made the food?”

“I did!” Ning Xi immediately raised her hand.

Lu Jingli’s face was one of total disbelief: “You can cook? Can we actually eat the food?”

Leading him to the table, the results were clear. The kitchen table was covered with dishes comparable to a restaurant’s head chef causing Lu Jingli to be dumbfounded.

“You really made this?”

Ning Xi quickly took Lu Jingli’s stolen vegetables and immediately fried them up.

After witnessing it personally, Lu Jingli had to believe that, she had made the food. But, because he couldn’t forgive the fact that she had stolen his food, he didn’t give her any credit.

“Hmph! What year do you think this is? Thinking that you can get a man’s heart through his stomach. I hope you’re not thinking about those stupid words. Three inches below the belly button (the thing below the belt) is the key, okay?”

Ning Xi had no choice but to laugh. The fact that she and Lu Jingli were thinking the same way was really amazing!

Though, the only one allowed to malign her is herself. How can she let others say that?

“Oh? Is that so?” Ning Xi tastefully raised one eyebrow, then picked up some rice and meat and stuffed it into Lu Jingli’s mouth.
