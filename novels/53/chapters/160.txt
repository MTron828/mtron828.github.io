Chapter 161: Not Seeing Him as a Man

After hearing that, Ning Xi immediately tossed all her embarassment to the back of her head, “You’re done? With all of it?”

Lu Tingxiao nodded and indicated for her to take a look herself.

Ning Xi was worried that she wouldn’t understand at first, but in the end, she found that Lu Tingxiao wasn’t trying to get her to look at those complicated lines of code, but was simply showing her the results on the screen.

The IP address of the sender was traced back to the apartment building that Ning Xueluo stayed in, Pearl River Grand View. The owner of the anonymous overseas account was Cui Caijing, Ning Xueluo’s assistant.

“I thought this kind of hacking only existed on TV! Especially hacking into anonymous accounts since they’re super safe. You have to enter the bank’s system to crack one, it’s practically impossible…” Ning Xi was so excited that she couldn’t speak for a long moment. Finally, she threw her arms around Lu Tingxiao, “Big Boss! You’re amazing!”

Lu Tingxiao: “…”

Right then and there, Lu Tingxiao found that he could no longer avoid facing a problem.

Ning Xi completely trusted in him now, but she had too much faith in him… to the point that she had forgotten that he was a man!

To put it simply, she was now treating him like a mentor and a good friend; she even took him for a father at times, but never saw him as a man.

This was a huge problem…

However, it was also a good omen. The time that he was waiting for was imminent.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

It was only after he had settled his turbulent emotions that Lu Tingxiao spoke up and asked her a question.

“What are you going to do with all this evidence?”

“There’s no hurry to make this evidence public. Let Ning Xueluo continue stirring up trouble. The more trouble she stirs up, the harder she’ll be hit when the time comes! I’m preparing… preparing…”

“Preparing what?”

“Uh… Lu Tingxiao, hold me for a bit, why do I feel like the floor is shaking…”

Just as she said ‘shaking’, Ning Xi’s vision turned black and she collapsed to the floor with a thump.

“Ning Xi——” Lu Tingxiao’s expression abruptly changed and he hurriedly caught her.

The soft body in his arms was on fire. He reached out and touched her forehead, and it was scalding hot.

He had sensed this heat previously, but he thought that he was simply imagining things. He hadn’t thought that she was really ill.

Lu Tingxiao picked up the person in his arms and hurriedly ran downstairs: “Uncle Yuan! Prepare the car!”

The old butler was shocked upon seeing the situation, “What happened to Miss Xi?”

“I don’t know.” Lu Tingxiao was panicking so much that his usual icy mask had cracked.

He didn’t know! He didn’t know if it was the remainder of the drugs in her system, or if she was simply having a fever. Or perhaps that Zhu Xiangcheng had given her something else?

Right now, Lu Tingxiao was submerged in self-blame. He should have brought her to the hospital for a checkup at the first possible moment. However, not only had he not done so, he had even delayed sending her to the hospital for so long. He had also tired her out by keeping her so busy.

So much had happened; she must have been under tremendous pressure. She had probably reached her limit, holding on up till now…

“Eldest Young Master, don’t get too nervous, it looks like Miss Xi is only having a fever. Why don’t we call the family doctor to take a look…”

However, Lu Tingxiao was already deaf to all suggestions. The driver brought the car over and he immediately carried her on board, “To the hospital!”

After saying so, he then turned to the butler standing outside the car and instructed him, “Call Qin Mufeng over as well!”

“Yes sir.” The butler could only helplessly agree.

If he had still been uncertain before, seeing how Eldest Young Master was acting now, everything would be made clear.

This girl was most likely going to be their future Eldest Young Mistress.
