Chapter 137: About To Go Insane

In the next second, Lu Tingxiao reached out and quickly pushed open the door. After one glance, he stopped blankly where he stood.

The air was quickly filled with a terrifyingly cold intent. The man’s eyes shot towards the nearby Lu Jingli like daggers. “You looked?”

Lu Jingli was so frightened that he pressed up against the door and spoke feebly, “If I didn’t look, how would I have known that she was Sister-in-law! You’re not going to get jealous about this too, are you? I can’t even see anything with those clothes and flower petals covering her! Also, if I hadn’t discovered her thanks to my curiosity, who knows what would have happened to her tonight? No matter how I look at this, my merits outweigh my wrongs! Aside from Darling Little Treasure, where are you going to find a godly assistant as helpful as me? I…”

Lu Tingxiao, “Get out!”

“Yessir. Thank you for your grace, my lord!” After getting let off the hook this time, Lu Jingli escaped immediately.

He knew that curiosity killed the cat, but he couldn’t help himself. Even after dodging a thousand bullets, he still couldn’t fix this bad habit of his!Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After Lu Jingli fled, Lu Tingxiao immediately entered the room and closed the door. When he was about ten steps away from the bed, his head went blank.

On the pure white bed with scarlet flower petals scattered about, with her china-like skin half-concealed, the girl’s eyelashes were trembling lightly underneath the lace. The single thin layer of fabric she had on was already covered in sweat and clinging tightly to her body. Her delicate little toes had curled up adorably due to her tension and alarm…

This scene was like some some sort of cruel test for Lu Tingxiao, who had been patiently enduring for so long.

He felt his throat dry up. His collar felt so tight he could barely even breathe. He extended a finger and loosened his tie roughly.

Most likely because that action had made a sound, the girl on the bed was so frightened that her entire body started trembling. She tried to shift off the bed with small movements. However, it seemed like she had been drugged; she didn’t have any strength at all. After using up all her energy, she had merely moved two centimeters. Exhausted, she gasped for breath as her chest rapidly rose and fell. The hair on her temples was dampened with sweat.

That scene felt like a single drop of water splashing into scalding hot oil.

As if he had been bewitched, Lu Tingxiao seemed to be moving by someone else’s will as he walked towards the bed, step by step, until he reached the bedside.

The girl keenly sensed that there was a person by the bed. She bit down so hard that she nearly broke her lip and used even more energy in her struggle to leave.

With an absent-minded expression, Lu Tingxiao reached out to the girl…

As he finally fulfilled his wish of touching the skin he had desired for so long, the burning temperature of her body seemed to travel through his finger and light him on fire.

However, in the next second, he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his finger.

The girl had bitten down fiercely on his finger.

Very quickly, bright red blood seeped out of his finger.

When he saw the girl’s dark red lips wrapped around his finger, even his pain had turned into pleasure.

Lu Tingxiao felt like he was about to go insane!

The pain didn’t clear his mind, but in an instant, the girl biting him suddenly lost her strength. The empty despair on her face hit him like a bucket of cold water, finally causing him to wake up.

Damn it! What was he doing?!

He was fully aware of how scared she was right now! He was fully aware that every second she spent in the dark was torment and suffering!

Lu Tingxiao quickly reached out his hands to untie the strip of lace covering her eyes.

The girl’s eyelashes trembled violently. Then, her eyes slowly opened, as if this was a slow motion replay of a beauty awakening after a thousand years of deep sleep…
