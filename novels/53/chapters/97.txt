Chapter 98: You’re the Only One Who Can Cure Me

After two hours, despite Lu Jingli’s valiant sacrifice, he couldn’t drag anything out of that kid Jiang Muye before collapsing drunkenly.

Actually, Jiang Muye was already on his last breath, but knowing that Lu Jingli wanted to interrogate him, he had held on until now.

It was hard having such a gossipy uncle…

He secretly felt that there was some reason why Lu Jingli was so adamant on trying to uncover this incident. However, his brain was mush right now and he couldn’t think.

The only one still sober at the table was Lu Tingxiao.

Lu Tingxiao called the butler to take Lu Jingli home, then stood up and walked towards the living room.

The sight that met his eyes was Ning Xi and Little Treasure lying flat on their backs on the sofa, sleeping soundly, with the words ‘Stage Clear’ on the TV screen in front of them.

Lu Tingxiao lightened his footsteps and walked over.

The girl was carrying a soft, white little bun in her arms. That sweet sleeping visage could give anyone the urge to give up all fame and prestige just to sleep with her quietly for the rest of their lives.

In the dining room, while in a daze, Jiang Muye watched Lu Tingxiao bend his body towards Ning Xi and get closer and closer… His pupils shrank and he was immediately wide awake.

Lu Tingxiao almost couldn’t help kissing the girl’s sleeping visage. However, he stopped at the last possible moment and turned towards Little Treasure, waking him up with a soft call.

The little bun rubbed his sleepy eyes. With a tuft of hair sticking up on his head, he looked even cuter than usual.

Lu Tingxiao rubbed his little head, “Can you walk by yourself?”

The little bun nodded.

Lu Tingxiao showed an expression of satisfaction, then bent over to pick up the sleeping Ning Xi in his arms. He met the little bun’s eyes and said, “Let’s go.”

The little bun obediently followed behind his daddy, seemingly not feeling that anything was strange.

Jiang Muye: “…?!”

Jiang Muye rubbed his eyes with all his strength. He was so drunk that he was hallucinating, right? It must be!

Why were Lu Tingxiao’s actions so mysterious?

He called the butler to pick up his younger brother and shook his sleeping son awake, but personally picked Ning Xi up to carry her back without waking her?

Seeing Lu Tingxiao carrying Ning Xi, with the little bun following behind as they left, Jiang Muye remained dazed. Finally, his head fell on the table as he finally collapsed from drunkenness…

In the Lu residence.

The little bun wanted to sleep together with Ning Xi.

Lu Tingxiao: “Men should keep their distance from women.”

The little bun showed five of his fingers, indicating that he was just five years old.

Lu Tingxiao nodded, “Very good. You realise that you’re no longer a three-year-old kid, but a five-year-old adult. Now go back to your own room to sleep.”

Little bun: “!!!”

Lu Tingxiao’s expression turned serious: “Do you want to be Auntie Xiao Xi’s darling forever? I can only keep her for three more months. If I can’t marry her by then, she’ll leave you forever.”

The little bun’s expression changed upon hearing this. He pouted in grievance and looked at Ning Xi, reluctant to leave. Finally, he slowly walked out while turning back three times with every step.

Lu Tingxiao sighed lightly.

Although Little Treasure was his biggest ally, he was also the greatest obstacle. It was good that he had finally convinced him for the moment.

Lu Tingxiao placed Ning Xi gently on the bed and helped her take off her shoes before calling one of the female maids to change her clothes.

While in a daze, Ning Xi felt that she had somehow returned to a soft bed. There was even a blurry figure in front of the bed…

She reached out towards that somewhat familiar figure, still a little hazy and sleepy, “Uh, Lu… Tingxiao… are you sleepwalking again?”

Stunned at the touch, Lu Tingxiao froze for a moment before his large palm covered her warm little hand, “Yes.”

Ning Xi frowned as she mumbled, “This is an illness… you have to treat it…”

Lu Tingxiao chuckled lowly and kissed her palm, “You’re the only one who can cure me.”
