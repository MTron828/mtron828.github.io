Chapter 93: The Truth Always Prevails

Finally, everyone packed up and left unhappily. After Jia Qingqing had caused such a ruckus, the director forced her to take two days off from filming to let her calm down.

Ning Xi had removed her makeup and was preparing to leave when Ning Xueluo quietly walked in. With her arms crossed over her chest and an expression full of contempt, she said, “Ning Xi, I really couldn’t tell that you were so devious!”

“Oh? I’m devious?” With a faint smile, Ning Xi cast a glance at the bloody scratch on Ning Xueluo’s arm, courtesy of Jia Qingqing. She then blinked with an innocent expression, “Wasn’t it you who had such great vision, picking such a great teammate?”

“You…” Ning Xueluo gritted her teeth. She was so angry that her chest hurt.

How could she have known that Jia Qingqing would be so stupid? Ning Xi’s reputation had already been marred to that point, yet she could somehow help her wash her reputation clean. The production crew were even changing their opinions of Ning Xi!

Ning Xi was sure to have something planned next. She had to quickly think of a way to respond to her actions, she absolutely could not let Ning Xi turn the tables around.

After that short confrontation with Ning Xueluo, Ning Xi was walking out of the set when her phone rang- it was a text message.

Corrupted Devil King: I’ll wait for you at the alleyway in front.

Ning Xi prudently replied him: We’ll each go our own ways. See you at home, I’ll look for you at your house.

An hour later, at Number 6 Platinum Palace.

Ning Xi had just walked to the door when Jiang Muye immediately tugged her in. He peeked out of his door and looked left and right, as if they were doing something shady.

Previously, he hadn’t minded if Ning Xi was connected to him in some way, and had even hated that he couldn’t announce their special relationship to the world. However, after experiencing that incident, he couldn’t help but reconsider what he had done previously.

Ning Xi put down her bag, kicked off her shoes and sat on the sofa cross-legged. The first thing she did was reach out her hand and ask: “Did you film it?”

Jiang Muye looked at her speechlessly. She completely didn’t care about her image in front of him. Did this damned woman even treat him as a man now? Why was she so casual in front of him? Her scoundrel-like appearance was exactly like how she was in the movie!

“Are you treating me like a lousy teammate too? Of course I got it!” Jiang Muye passed his phone over unhappily.

When she had mentioned that she wanted to act like an innocent flower, he had already guessed what she wanted to do. Of course she was going to film all the exciting drama.

Ning Xi took the phone and pressed play. She nodded in satisfaction, “You did pretty well! I’ll add a chicken leg for you!”

Following that, she opened her Weibo and tweeted with her main account. Of course, the contents weren’t an apology like Chang Li wanted, but four words: The truth always prevails.

After tweeting that out, she quickly logged into her side account and messaged a blogger specialising in Golden Age Entertainment gossip. She then sent the video containing Jia Qingqing’s continuous failed scenes to him.

Those two companies were really dead rivals. Not much time had passed since Ning Xi sent the message when the blog immediately posted the clip. They even added a very eye-catching caption: Failing a scene 33 times, the #1 useless flower vase in the entertainment circle shows you what shit acting is.

Jiang Muye cast a glance at her, “You’re just sending it to this blog? You’re not sending it to other blogs? I filmed that so painstakingly!”

Ning Xi had her head lowered and was buried in the comments section: “This is enough to draw attention. We don’t need to do anything for the next step. Did you think that you were the only one filming just now?”

“Why didn’t you use that to deal with Jia Qingqing earlier? If you had done that earlier, she would have been swapped out immediately and there wouldn’t be so much drama. You even made me endure that woman for two days!” Jiang Muye muttered unhappily.

No one had understood why Jia Qingqing kept forgetting her lines, only Jiang Muye knew what had happened.
