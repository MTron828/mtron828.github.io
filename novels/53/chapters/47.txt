By the time everyone could react, the whole set had been turned into an ocean of red. On such a hot summer day, it made everyone feel even hotter.

While Ning Xi held onto a card, feeling like she was about to faint.

A row of words was written on the card: ‘Remember to come pick me up at the airport~ –Corrupted Devil King’.

“Miss Ning, please sign off on the delivery.”

I’ll sign off on your sister!

“Please take it all back, it’ll affect everyone’s work piled up here!” Ning Xi tried her best to keep a gentle tone as she rejected the gift.

“We can’t do that, we promised our customer that we can only go once we’ve watched you sign on the receipt!” The flower boy was troubled.

At this moment, one of the prop directors hurriedly tried to persuade her, “Ning Xi, just accept them, just accept them! Coincidentally, we have a scene that needs roses later on, so we won’t need to spend so much effort to prepare them if you give them to us!”

Since the prop director had already said so, Ning Xi could not bear to trouble the delivery boy any longer. She pinched the space between her eyebrows, then messily signed her own name.

By this point, everyone watching from the side started whispering amongst themselves with envy on their faces:

“My gosh! There are so many roses! It’s so romantic! Who sent them?”

“Do you even need to ask? It definitely has to be a suitor! Beautiful women are really treated differently, to think that someone sent flowers on the first day of filming! And they sent so many!”

The assistant by Ning Xueluo’s side, Cui Caijing, said carelessly, “Although there are so many of them, it doesn’t actually cost much!”

Just as she said so, someone suddenly came over looking for Ning Xi.

It wasn’t so eye-catching this time as the new arrival carefully passed her a small box.

All the busybodies stretched their heads over trying to peek, what was it this time?Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Ning Xi’s face was full of suspicion as she opened it, only to see a huge, sparkling diamond with a note. The note said: ‘Long time no see.’, and was signed off as ‘YS’.

Staring at those two letters, Ning Xi’s expression turned even uglier.

****! Were they collaborating together on this? She was trying to keep a low profile, why was it so hard?

In such a short time, she had first gotten fresh flowers and then diamonds. The whole production team was in an uproar.

“Oh my god! That diamond is freaking huge! My eyes are about to go blind!”

“Ning Xi’s suitors are so crazy!”

This time, Cui Caijing had nothing to say, she could only whisper sourly, “Who knows if it’s real or not.”

While Ning Xi collapsed in a chair, looking like she couldn’t live on.

Whatever was supposed to happen, would come eventually…

She couldn’t even hide…

Ning Xi took a few deep breaths and tried her best to recover her calm, before walking to the director, “My apologies, Director Guo. I’ve caused trouble for the crew…”

Guo Qisheng didn’t seem to mind at all, he chuckled as he waved away her apology, “It’s natural to have a few suitors when you’re such a beautiful lady! There’s nothing to apologise for! We’ve even gotten your flowers for free!”

Not far away, Ning Xueluo looked calm on the outside, but she was gritting her teeth in irritation.

How could she not be jealous? That village girl who had still reeked of dirt back then, could actually drive men mad to the point of sending such extravagant gifts and effortlessly get the things she had to work so hard to get…

Taking advantage of the little time she had before the next scene started, Ning Xi quickly found a corner and dialed a number.

“Hello? Have you received my present, darling?” A leisurely tone sounded from the phone.

“Jiang Muye! **** your grandfather! Are you for real?” In contrast, Ning Xi was on fire.

“Tsk, tsk. You’re the very first one who’s ever refused to **** me after receiving my roses, and you even want to **** my grandfather! Aren’t your tastes too weird?”

“Stop changing the topic! What do you want?”

“Nothing, I just wanted to remind you to come pick me up at the airport. You’ve promised me!”

“You still dare to let me pick you up? Aren’t you afraid that I’ll bring a 40m knife and chop you to death with it, you bastard?” Ning Xi strongly suppressed her killing intent.

“So you’re going back on your word?” The person’s tone turned cold.

“The condition for going to pick you up was that you would lend me 8 million, but now I don’t need it. Didn’t I send you a text explaining that?”

“I don’t care anyway, you’ve already promised me. Although I didn’t lend you the money in the end, but I agreed the moment you asked, even though it was such a huge sum. How could that be fake? Don’t you hate owing people the most? Doesn’t this still count as a favour?”
