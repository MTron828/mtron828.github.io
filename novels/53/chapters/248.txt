Chapter 249: Beauty Was Dangerous!

Translator: Henyee  Editor: Henyee

Ning Xi shook her head and quickly ended the dangerous and ambiguous “teacher-student” talk. She then switched to employee mode, raised her hand, and said primly…

“Boss, I would like to apply for a period of consideration without disturbances!”

After thinking about it, Lu Tingxiao agreed without reservation: “Granted, how many days do you want?”

Ning Xi counted with her fingers, then said weakly, “Um, can I count in years?”

“I’ll give you seven days.” Lu Tingxiao ignored her unreasonable request and made the decision for her.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Okay… seven days it is! Then, after I leave the hospital tomorrow, can I stay at my apartment for the time being? You just agreed, no disturbances! Little Treasure isn’t home, and I need to be at the company the day after tomorrow, and the apartment’s a little closer to it!” Ning Xi did her best to give a legitimate reason.

“You can.” Lu Tingxiao nodded without the slightest hesitation.

“…”Hah, that was it? When he suddenly stopped tripping her up, she was not used to it.

Ning Xi narrowed her eyes, a fox-like expression on her face. It seemed she had discovered the best way to deal with the Big Demon King’s tricks! To bet on her own health?

Was it because earlier, the doctor had said that she shouldn’t put too much stress on herself?

Ai, this only worked because he cared for her too much…

When she thought this, the number in her heart shot up to eighty percent!

…

Next day.

Because her condition wasn’t serious, Ning Xi was discharged from the hospital in the morning.

As he promised, Lu Tingxiao sent her to her apartment, stopping by the supermarket on the way to buy things to fill up the fridge with, and ordered three meals every day for her, warning her repeatedly to watch what she ate.

Ning Xi sat on the sofa, watching Lu Tingxiao go back and forth busily. After checking the fridge, he still stood there trying to think if he had missed anything. Ning Xi couldn’t take it anymore, and coughed lightly. “Lu Tingxiao, no need to trouble yourself anymore, I can take care of myself!”

Lu Tingxiao turned and walked towards her. “Then I’m heading out.”

Even as he said that, his face was still full of worry, as if she was a three-year-old kid who couldn’t do anything for herself at all.

Ning Xi struggled to keep the number inside her heart unchanged. “Mm.”

“You sure you’re alright now?”

“Yes! Yes! My stomach isn’t hurting at all anymore! My body recovers very fast!”

“Mm,that’s good.” Lu Tingxiao’s eyes grew darker, and he nodded in satisfaction.

Ning Xi: “…” There was nothing wrong with what she’d said, but why did she feel like she had been tricked?

She was lost in thought when Lu Tingxiao suddenly leaned in towards her.But before he got close, he stopped halfway, then retreated a bit. He stretched out one hand to rub the top of her head. “No disturbances.”

Ning Xi: “…”

You! Are! Disturbing! Me! Already!

She finally understood, this person didn’t need to do anything, his existence was a huge disturbance itself.

After Lu Tingxiao left, Ning Xi finally completely relaxed. She hugged a pillow in her arms and fell into a daze on the sofa, thinking about everything that had happened lately…

In the end, things had still come to this point. She had had a premonition, and she had also been prepared, but now that they were here, her brain was still blank and everything was a confused mess.

She gave her a score of zero for this appearance of hers!

Actually, she planned in the beginning to say some deliberately brutal things to make Lu Tingxiao give up on her. But when she looked at his face, she couldn’t say a single word, and her originally resolute heart was starting to waver. What she had always thought would never happen, was slowly starting to change…

No wonder there had been incapable rulers in their history!

Beauty was dangerous!
