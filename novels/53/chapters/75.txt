Chapter 76: Sister-in-law is Indeed Mighty and Formidable!

After the cable was unplugged, Lu Jingli couldn’t hear Ning Xi anymore. He could only guess that she was asking Lu Tingxiao to come back home.

After hearing his brother’s heartless reply, he shouted in his heart, “No way! Even Ning Xi had no effect after personally taking action! Don’t tell me it’s my fate to die here? ”

Ning Xi’s voice became even softer, “But I don’t have the confidence to take Little Treasure out by myself. What if something unexpected happens? Little Treasure is definitely hoping for you to join us too! Come back, okay? Please?”

Lu Tingxiao stayed silent for three seconds, before replying, “Okay, I’ll return home immediately.”

Lu Jingli was dumbfounded for a moment. He suddenly felt like he had been enveloped in a brilliant light, as if he was going to ascend to heaven!

Sister-in-law is indeed mighty and formidable!

He just knew she could do it!

He had thought that his brother wasn’t going to budge, but it turns out that it was just a tsundere act!

After hanging up, Lu Tingxiao spoke two words, “Meeting adjourned.”

All his subordinates looked at each other blankly, not daring to believe that they had been let off just like that!

Lu Jingli proudly snorted. Everyone ought to thank me. I was the one who called our savior. You guys are all riding on my coattails!

Lu Jingli was surrounded right after the meeting ended.

“Second Young Master! Did we hear wrongly just now? A woman actually called CEO Lu!”

“Who was that calling? She was able to draw CEO Lu out of a meeting with a single phone call!”

“Seriously! Does CEO Lu have someone by his side now? Which young heiress is she? Second Young Master, spill the beans!”

……

Lu Jingli stared vigilantly at them, “What are you all doing! Are you guys plotting something by asking me who she is? Trying to hug her leg? No way! Only I get to hug my future sister-in-law’s leg! Don’t even think about it!”

Everyone: “…” Couldn’t they at least hug a toe?

……

In a corner within the movie city, Ning Xi ended the call, feeling as though a burden had lifted from her shoulders.

The situation had finally been resolved…

There shouldn’t be any more problems, right?

This matter was obviously completely unrelated to her. She was really selfless!

Just as she prepared to leave, her phone rang. It was Lu Jingli again.

“Second Young Master, what’s wrong? Was that not enough?

“Nonono, Little Xixi, your beauty trap was really too awesome! It solved the crisis perfectly!”

Ning Xi’s face darkened. “What beauty trap! I was clearly luring the tiger out of his den okay? Are you even familiar with your idioms!”

“Ahh! I understand, I understand! Ok that’s all. I’m hanging up! I’ll treat you to a meal next time!”

Ning Xi silently stared at the phone in her hand.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

What had that guy actually understood?

“Little Ning Xi, why are you hiding here? Let’s go eat!” Out of nowhere, Jiang Muye came looking for her.

Ning Xi nervously glanced around in every direction. After confirming that no one had seen him looking for her, she relaxed. She leaned against the large red palace pillar with exhaustion and spoke, “You guys go ahead and eat. I’m busy tonight so I won’t be able to go anymore.”

“What?” Jiang Muye’s face immediately fell. “This is my welcome dinner and I’m your love interest in the movie! You’re not going to come?”

Ning Xi pinched the top of the bridge of her nose. “I know I know, I’m in the wrong. But I really do have something important going on today. Next time, I’ll take you out on our own, okay?”

“Not okay!” Jiang Muye wasn’t persuaded at all. He fiercely looked her up and down. “What important business do you have? Who are you meeting with tonight?”

Ning Xi heard his words and her tone turned serious, “I believe that whoever I meet with isn’t any of your business?”

After she finished speaking, Jiang Muye’s expression immediately turned unsightly, “You’re going to see Lu Tingxiao, aren’t you?”
