Chapter 156: Where Are Your Hands Going

Zhang Jiang’s first reaction was to beg for forgiveness, “I don’t want it, I don’t want it! My great ancestor, please spare me! In the past, I wasn’t enlightened so I spoke some nonsense. How could I even dare to ask for your money?!”

“Who said that I’d give you money?” Ning Xi threw a kick.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

After rolling over and standing up, Zhang Jiang wore an innocent expression, “But didn’t you just say…”

He was about to go crazy from all the abuse he was getting from this person’s mood swings.

Ning Xi cast him a cold glance, “Stay at home and wait for me to contact you. As long as you cooperate with me, there’ll be money in it for you. Otherwise…”

Ah? She still wanted to contact him? Hadn’t he already give her everything she wanted? Weren’t they agreed on never crossing paths again? Why was she still hounding him?! He didn’t want any money! He preferred to stay alive!

Zhang Jiang had a lot of unspoken complaints, but all he could do was agree to her demands and thank Ning Xi a thousand times for her kindness and grace as he sent her out.

After going downstairs, Ning Xi put on her helmet and started up the engine before speeding straight towards the Lu residence.

When she arrived at the Lu residence, she was actually an hour earlier than the time she had agreed on with Lu Tingxiao.

When she entered the living room, Lu Tingxiao was just as she had left him. He was still sitting on the living room couch, looking as if he hadn’t even budged at all.

Ning Xi didn’t think much of it. She asked immediately, “Lu Tingxiao, I’m back! Did Darling Little Treasure wake up?”

“He hasn’t.”

“Alright, that’s good. I’m going up to check on him!”

“Hold on.” Lu Tingxiao suddenly called out to stop her.

“Uh, what’s up?” For some reason, Ning Xi felt like Lu Tingxiao’s mood wasn’t quite right.

“Where did you go?” Lu Tingxiao’s tone was calm and even, yet it felt like there was something dark hidden beneath the surface.

Ning Xi instinctively sensed the danger and responded hastily, “I went out to handle some personal matters, that’s all. Everything’s already been settled! I’ll be going upstairs now!”

She tried to slip away right after she finished speaking, but an arm suddenly reached over. A second later, caught off guard, Ning Xi’s body was pulled with some force and she fell onto the couch.

More accurately, she fell into Lu Tingxiao’s embrace.

Ning Xi was shocked. What surprised her even more was, “Lu Tingxiao! Y-You… What are you doing? Where are your hands going?!”

Lu Tingxiao completely ignored her and continued to touch her all over.

“Hey, I’m going to fight back if you continue like this! You can’t blame me if I hurt you then!”

“Then do it.”

Ning Xi’s nerves were practically about to collapse, “F***! Lu Tingxiao! What are you trying to do? You’ve already figured out that I can’t make a move against you, haven’t you?”

Lu Tingxaio stared at her expressionlessly, “Why can’t you make a move against me?”

“I… Because…”

That’s right! Why? If it was anyone else, her first reaction would have been to dole out a generous beating…

While Ning Xi was racking her brains to come up with a reply to that question, Lu Tingxiao’s hands landed dangerously upon an object behind the waistline of her pants.

Ning Xi’s eyes immediately flashed. She wanted to stop him, but it was already too late. The gun that was hidden behind her waist appeared in Lu Tingxiao’s hands in an instant.

Lu Tingxiao immediately threw the gun onto the coffee table in front of them. The usual exceedingly gentle expression he used towards her had turned as cold as frost. He spit out a word like he was shooting a blade of ice, “Explain.”

Ning Xi immediately felt like she had been caught red handed cheating on a test by the teacher. Her face paled and she fiddled with her fingers. With great effort, she put on a carefree expression and spoke, “Hehe, it’s just a fake! It’s a toy gun that I bought to play around with!”

“Is that so? Does a toy gun need a silencer?” Lu Tingxiao cast her a sideways glance and picked up the gun. He pointed it directly at a palm-sized, white jade flower vase sitting in the corner and opened fire.

The flower vase immediately shattered into tiny pieces.

The calm expression that Ning Xi had been using all her strength to keep on her face also shattered… just like the flower vase…
