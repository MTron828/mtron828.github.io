Chapter 37: Entering the Female Restroom To Find Her

In the car, Little Treasure stared at the phone waiting for a reply, his expression one of great suffering and hatred.

Lu Tingxiao unfastened his seatbelt, “I’ll go take a look, wait for me here.”

Little Treasure grabbed onto the corner of his father’s shirt, indicating that he wanted to tag along with him.

Lu Tingxiao looked at his son, “If she’s drunk, I can only carry one of you.”

Little Treasure puffed up his cheeks, indicating that he wasn’t satisfied with the answer. He didn’t need anyone to carry him!

Lu Tingxiao’s expression darkened, “Unfortunately, my trust in you is at its lowest since the incident from last time. I’m unable to believe that you’ll be able to take care of yourself. If you get lost again, even I won’t be able to bear the consequences. Understand?”

Little Treasure bowed his head with a lonely expression.

Realising that he had spoken too seriously, Lu Tingxiao rubbed his son’s little head, “I’ll be right back.”

“Lao Zhang, bring the car to the underground garage.”

“Yes, young master.”

Under the excited gazes of the crowd gathered at the hotel entrance, the car door slowly opened and a man stepped out.

He was wearing a grey western suit, his body was long and lean and he had a powerful aura.

“Ah— It’s… It’s Lu Tingxiao!! I was wondering which god of wealth had come. I didn’t think it would be the God of Wealth! I totally predicted it, other than the God of Wealth, who else could afford to drive such an expensive car!? The Su family obviously can’t even compare to Master Lu!”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Heavens, hold me for a bit, I’m going to faint… I’ve only seen him on a magazine once, I didn’t think I’d meet the real person here! I really want to go ask him for his signature and have him sign it on my panties!!!”

“Those handsome and famous actors can only kneel before our Master Lu! If Master Lu enters the entertainment circle, how would they continue surviving?”

“You’re still dreaming! We’ve already used up a lifetime of luck to see him this close in person! You still want him to enter the entertainment circle for your viewing pleasure everyday?”

……

The people at the door continued gossiping fervently long after the man in question had entered the hotel.

“Big Boss Lu is usually swarmed by a retinue wherever he appears. Why is he coming to a hotel alone so late at night?”

“Who knows, anyway he can’t possibly coming here for a woman!”

“It’s such a shame that an outstanding man like that doesn’t get close to women! Why do you think Lu Tingxiao won’t get close to women?”

“He probably likes men!”

“That’s just nonsense! If he likes men, then where did his son come from? I feel that Master Lu must be the kind that’s deeply in love. His feelings for the child’s mother are so deep that he’s been keeping her secret for so many years!”

……

Lu Tingxiao found that the cast and crew had all left when he got upstairs. The group of people at the hotel’s entrance were most likely the last batch. However, only Ning Xi was missing.

He tried calling Ning Xi’s phone as he walked down the corridors searching for her.

No one picked up.

As he was passing by the restrooms, Lu Tingxiao suddenly paused his steps. He could hear a phone ringing.

After standing still and listening for a while, he realised it was coming from the female restroom.

Lu Tingxiao ended the call, and the sound stopped.

After heaving a sigh of relief at finally finding the person he was looking for, Lu Tingxiao furrowed his brows.

He couldn’t enter the female restroom to find her.

Since she had not reacted at all to the loud ringing of her phone, she must be quite drunk.

“Ning Xi?”

Lu Tingxiao tried calling for her, but as expected, there was no reply.

He stood in front of the sink between the male and female restrooms, and raised his long fingers to pinch at the center of his brows. The expression on his face was as if he were making a decision on a 10 billion yuan business deal.
