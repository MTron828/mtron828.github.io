Chapter 97: She’s the One Who Chased Me

After the three of them had come, there was nothing left for Jiang Muye to do.

Lu Tingxiao had invited a Michelin chef to cook dinner, Lu Jingli had brought two bottles of good wine from home and Little Treasure took Ning Xi away.

The five of them then sat around the table with a weird atmosphere.

Luckily, Lu Jingli was still around, so it wasn’t too awkward. They ate and chatted idly on and off.

“Here, let’s welcome our great star back home! Second Uncle will give you a toast!”

“Thank you!”

“That’s right, I didn’t get the chance to ask you yet. How did you meet Xiao Xixi?” Lu Jingli asked seemingly thoughtlessly, trying to suss out information on behalf of his brother.

Hearing this question, Jiang Muye’s expression didn’t look too good. It seemed like he didn’t really want to discuss this topic. He replied vaguely: “We met in university overseas, and we’re in the same batch.”

Lu Jingli narrowed his eyes and glanced at him sideways, saying with some hidden meaning, “I think it’s not that simple, right? Don’t tell me she’s an ex that you chased and tossed aside after you got her? The women by your side, excluding your mum and your fans, are your ex-girlfriends!”

Jiang Muye: “…”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Ning Xi snorted in laughter and gave Lu Jingli a thumbs-up: “Second Young Master, you’re too smart!”

“Hey, it looks like I guessed right!” Lu Jingli’s expression was full of pride. There really was nothing he couldn’t guess in this world.

“You’re only half right!” Jiang Muye retorted, his face turning dark.

“Eh? What do you mean by half right?” Lu Jingli didn’t understand.

“She’s my ex-girlfriend alright, but she was the one who chased me and dumped me!” Jiang Muye glared at Ning Xi sitting opposite with the expression of an abandoned wife as he spoke.

An imperceptible glint flashed across Lu Tingxiao’s eyes while he was helping Ning Xi and Little Treasure cut their steaks.

Even Lu Jingli was startled, this was the first time he had guessed wrongly. He slammed the table with both hands and spoke while trying to hold back his excitement: “Really? Are you kidding me? This doesn’t make sense!”

No matter how Ning Xi had been like overseas, she couldn’t match up to the absurdity of this kid, so he had always thought that it was Jiang Muye who had initiated the breakup between the two. He hadn’t expected…

Jiang Muye stabbed a rib on his plate angrily, “Ask her if you don’t believe me!”

Why did they get onto this topic suddenly? Ning Xi’s face was full of helplessness, “That was a complete accident!”

The burning desire for gossip in Lu Jingli had already been lit up, and he was no longer just asking for his brother. He asked curiously, “Then what happened? Tell me quick! Quick quick quick!”

Jiang Muye was speechless.

As someone from the older generation, is it really good for you to be so interested in the younger generation’s gossip?

Seeing that Jiang Muye’s expression had turned ugly, and not wanting to make him look bad in front of his seniors, Ning Xi answered, “It’s nothing special. So many girls liked him back then in school. I was just one of them. In the end, we broke up because I found that he wasn’t what I imagined and my fantasy collapsed!”

It seemed like there was nothing wrong with Ning Xi’s words, but Lu Jingli knew that things weren’t as simple as that. Otherwise, Jiang Muye’s expression wouldn’t look like that.

Tsk, he was going to see if he could drag something out of the kid after giving him some wine later.

Since Little Treasure was around, Ning Xi didn’t drink tonight. After she finished eating, she sat by the table and was a little bored. Thus, she asked: “Mr Lu, can I go bring Little Treasure over there to play some games?”

Lu Tingxiao nodded, “Go ahead.”

Although the tone he used with Ning Xi seemed rather normal, it gave off a warm feeling that wasn’t there with other people.

Jiang Muye’s face was full of resentment. That was his video game machine, the setup that he had brought back specially. She actually asked permission from another man, and was going to play with another man!

He wouldn’t accept it even if that man was just five years old!
