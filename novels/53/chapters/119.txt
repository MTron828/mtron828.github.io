Chapter 120: A Splendid Death

After Su Yan had left, Jiang Muye continued casting sidelong glances at Ning Xi while snorting coldly, “So, that fellow was the true love that made you suffer so much back then? Indeed, there must be something wrong with your eyes!”

Ning Xi slowly swept her eyes over him, “I think there’s something wrong with your eyes. Someone like Su Yan can score at least 9 out of 10 points, okay?”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After hearing so, Jiang Muye exploded, “What the ****, how could he possibly score 9 points!?”

Ning Xi said in a matter-of-fact tone, “Just based on the fact that he’s someone I’ve loved before. If I say that he sucks, isn’t that basically hitting my own face? Anyway, leaving aside my subjective viewpoint, from an objective viewpoint, you can’t deny that he’s worth 9 points.”

“While Su Yan’s looks aren’t a match for yours, where you are capable of even blinding people with one glance, he wins in terms of his temperament. He’s the warm and refined type; if he was in a fairy tale, then he would be a prince. If he was in an ancient tale, he would be an elegant gentleman. Ooh, a pure gentleman with no equal… Basically he’s the type that I liked the most in my teenage days, the kind that I would fall for at first sight!”

The fire in Jiang Muye’s heart grew even stronger as he continued listening, “Damn, Little Ning Xi, do you still have feelings for him? You’re practically praising him to high heaven!”

Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him, “I really don’t care about him anymore. How else could I use such an impartial tone to praise him in front of you? What kind of IQ do you have!”

Furthermore, the one she was describing was merely the Su Yan living in her memories, the lively and perfect teenage boy, not the present Su Yan.

Sometimes, it was because memories felt too perfect that reality seemed even more cruel in comparison.

It took Jiang Muye a long while to push down his anger. He asked in a low, muffled voice, “Then how many points would you give me?”

Ning Xi rubbed her chin. Under Jiang Muye’s anxious gaze, she replied: “9.9 points! Just based on your face, you get that many points!”

After hearing so, Jiang Muye’s temper was soothed. He touched his own face, and pride showed in his expression, “Of course! I depend on my face to earn my living! However, why did you deduct 0.1 from my points?”

Ning Xi looked at him as if she were looking at an idiot, “Do you even need to ask? Of course I took it off because of your low IQ!”

Jiang Muye: “…”

Forget it, forget it. Seeing that she had given him 9.9 points, he wouldn’t continue quibbling with her.

With a twinkling expression, Jiang Muye couldn’t resist asking another question, “Then… What about Lu Tingxiao? How many points would you give him? Right now, in your heart, what type of man is he?”

“Oh, Lu Tingxiao…” It was a little hard for Ning Xi to answer this question. After thinking for a long time, she finally replied, “I don’t dare to judge the great demon king. If you’re talking about type, then he’s the type that you can watch from afar, but can never be touched or played with.”

“He looks like a calm sea on the surface, but you’ll never know what’s hiding in the depths of the waters. This kind of man is unfathomable. If you dive in too deep without careful consideration, you might just drown in his depths!”

Hearing so, Jiang Muye’s expression turned much warmer, “Hmph, at least you still have some rationality left!”

“But…” Ning Xi muttered to herself.

“But what?” Jiang Muye asked anxiously.

Ning Xi propped up her chin and smiled, “But, if I died in such a splendid way, it’d be worth it to become a ghost!”

“****! Little Ning Xi!”

“Hahahaha, I’m just joking, just joking. Don’t get so worked up!”

Jiang Muye almost expired from anger, “I think you’re spouting truth after drinking too much! I thought that you had some intentions towards Lu Tingxiao from the start! Are you thinking of sleeping with him?”
