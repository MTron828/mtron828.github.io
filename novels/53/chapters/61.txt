Chapter 62: Come, Kiss Me Here!

Inside the black minivan.

“My good grandson, do you know where granny lives?”

“Ning Xi, try calling me grandson again?”

“Grandsooooon! So what if I call you that?”

“I… I’m going to have it out with you!”

“Come at me! I was still worried you wouldn’t dare to!”

“Ah! This damned woman, you’re really hitting me!”

……

The backseat rocked with clatters and commotion, and the manager, Lei Ming, driving in the front was completely speechless, “Muye, I told you you wouldn’t be able to outplay her but you wouldn’t believe me. Are you happy now? Tomorrow’s headline is going to change from ‘Hot chick picks Jiang Muye up from the airport’ to ‘Old lady picks Jiang Muye up from the airport’…”

Jiang Muye, who was currently being pinned down by Ning Xi, was flustered and exasperated, “Shut up!”

Lei Ming looked at the battlefield in the backseat from the rearview mirror, and his mouth twitched as his head was filled with sweatdrops, “Ning Xi, could you go easier on him? Take it that I’m pleading you! He has to film a movie, a commercial and a special magazine feature this month…”

“I know, Ming-ge, I won’t hit his face… You better stop squirming about!”

At this point, Jiang Muye had completely lost the handsome and elegant image he had at the airport, he was currently handcuffed by both hands and pressed down on the car seat. He looked like he had been ravaged.

“Ning Xi… you forced me to do this…”

Ning Xi was still happily beating him up, but Jiang Muye abruptly used his cuffed hands to wrap around the back of her neck and pulled her down with him…

Seeing that handsome face close up so suddenly, Ning Xi subconsciously backed away and raised her head, a carefree smile on her face, “What, you’re going to use your beauty since you can’t beat me?”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Just as he was about to kiss her lips, Jiang Muye abruptly turned away, “Euurgghh…”

“Hahahahahaha…” Ning Xi laughed until she had to hold her stomach and curled up, “Come try it again! Kiss, kiss me here! Isn’t granny’s makeup so pretty today?”

Looking at Ning Xi’s wrinkled and pockmarked face, Jiang Muye laid there like a dead fish, as if he had lost all interest in life.

Ning Xi finally finished laughing and panted for breath as she sat up, “What’s wrong? You’re really angry? Who made you try to trap me first! You’re not going to let me take revenge?”

“Bastard, we haven’t met in so long, can’t you miss me just a little bit? You actually beat me up when we finally met again!” Jiang Muye glared at her with anger, and even a trace of grievance in the depths of his pupils.

Ning Xi smiled, “Of course I did! Didn’t I say it at the airport? Granny misses you!”

“…” To prevent himself from dying from excessive anger, Jiang Muye finally gave up communicating with her. He raised his handcuffed hands and said in a rage, “Why haven’t you untied me yet! Where the heck did you get these handcuffs? These are prohibited items in China, aren’t they!”

Ning Xi rubbed her chin, “This, well it seems like I bought it from a sex goods shop on Taobao! It was 20% off, it only cost $9.90!”

Jiang Muye: “…”

Lei Ming: “…”

Worried that the two of them were going to fight again, Lei Ming hurriedly changed the topic, “We’ve already left the reporters and fans behind, where are we going now?”

Jiang Muye pulled out a hand mirror to rescue his hair. Upon hearing his manager’s words, he didn’t even raise his head as he said, “Go back to my residence in the city outskirts.”

Ning Xi immediately sat up, “Then let me down by the roadside, I’ll take a cab home!”

“Heh, did you think you could run away tonight? I’ll see where you try to run!” Jiang Muye gritted his teeth sinisterly and locked the car doors tight.

“…” Ning Xi sweatdropped. She knew that this would happen.

On the road, as they continued driving, Ning Xi felt that something wasn’t right. Why was this road so familiar?

“Mr Rich Boy Jiang, you have properties in Beijing? That property wouldn’t happen to be in Platinum Palace, would it?” Ning Xi tried asking.

Jiang Muye harrumphed, “It is, so what? Suddenly thinking of hugging my big leg? It’s too late, I tell you! Unless you call me grandfather!”

Ning Xi was a little despondent.

It can’t be such a coincidence that Jiang Muye’s residence was also at Platinum Palace?

For some reason, blaring alarms started sounding off in her mind, giving her an unpleasant premonition…
