Chapter 268: So, Are You Kissing Me Or Not?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Without any further delay, the second take began.

Meng Changge tapped his shoulder from the back, saying, “My dear husband, were you looking for me?”

Sun Huanqing turned around to hug her, “Changge…”

Guo Qisheng, “Cut! Ning Xi, watch your expression, why are you suddenly losing focus?”

Ning Xi bowed her head in shame and said, “Sorry!”

The third take began.

Meng Changge, “My dear husband, were you looking for me?”

Sun Huanqing, “Changge…”

Gui Qisheng blurted out, “Cut! Ning Xi, you took too long staring at him. The most you should take is three seconds before you plant the kiss, okay?”

Ning Xi mumbled, “Okay.”

The fourth take…

Guo Qisheng exclaimed, “Ning Xi, you are being too stiff and inexpressive! What are you looking at?”

And then there was a fifth time…

And a sixth…

…

In the end, Ning Xi had six bad takes in a row!

Even Jiang Muye was about to break down and he started exclaiming in the restroom, “Dude! I’m about to get a heart attack! Are you going to kiss me or not? Can’t you hurry up?”

Ning Xi pulled her hair in frustration, “Ahh! I’m the one who’s about to get a heart attack okay! Can’t you get your uncle to leave? His staring at me is like an X-ray screening! Who would be able to kiss like this?!”

Jiang Muye scoffed, “He came for you, what can I do to make him leave?”

Ning Xi pulled off her wig in exasperation, “Dang it! I really can’t stand it!”

“Hey, please watch your reputation…,” Jiang Muye cautioned. Ning Xi was about to lose her temper due to the intense pressure. He had never seen her been this irritated.

From a different perspective, it could also be said that…Lu Tingxiao’s influence on her was pretty significant…

More significant than he had thought…

At least previously, no one else affected her acting performance.

A profusely sweating Guo Qisheng entered the restroom to give Ning Xi some advice, “Ning Xi, what’s wrong with you today? Is Lu Tingxiao’s presence making you nervous? Just take it easy! Now is not the time to panic!”

Ning Xi looked down apologetically and said, “I’m sorry for troubling you, director!”

“Sigh, it’s fine. Which actors don’t have bad takes? Who knew that the big boss would have come today? Everyone was taken unaware! It’s not just you, everyone else on set is equally nervous! Do you want to call your manager over?” Guo Qisheng suggested.

Ning Xi shook her head, “No need for that, let’s not trouble Zhizhi. I can do this, please get ready for the next take!”

“You sure?”

“I’m sure.”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

….

Three minutes later, the seventh take began.

Ning Xi walked to the camera with her teeth clenched and narrowed her stare at Lu Tingxiao. He was playing around with the tea leaves using the cover of the cup, with a smug expression on his face.

The bastard, he was definitely doing this on purpose! His negative presence was clearly trying to make her distracted and under perform!

“Changge…,” Jiang Muye hugged Ning Xi. Actually, wasn’t he just as pressured? Every time he hugged Ning Xi, he felt like he was being stabbed at with a million arrows from the back!

Ning Xi took down the mask off her face, and looked at him longingly for three seconds, before slowing leaning towards him…

Up to this point, everything was going smoothly. However, as she was about to touch his lips, the hostile stare of the person behind her forced her to lose focus, and she just couldn’t plant that kiss, no matter what.

Dang it!

In a flash of an eye, Ning Xi unexpectedly put the mask back on.

In the next second, using the mask as a second identity, she planted a kiss on Jiang Muye’s lips…
