Chapter 44: Flirting Abilities Awakened

After Ning Xi had finally calmed down, she realised that she had been crying in Lu Tingxiao’s embrace for half an hour.

It was… too shocking…

Excluding the times when she had to cry for filming, she hadn’t really cried her heart out for a whole five years.

“Uh, sorry, I dirtied your clothes…” Ning Xi was embarrassed after seeing the mess she had made of Lu Tingxiao’s shirt.

The corners of his lips lifted slightly, “It’s an honour for my shirt.”

Ning Xi was immediately dazed, and her heart beat wildly from the blow.

She had always thought that Lu Tingxiao was the kind of genius that had high IQ and low EQ.

Who would have thought that when he would be this deadly when he started flirting!

She was jealous! He was even better at picking up girls than she was!

Lu Tingxiao tidied up her messy strands of hair as if it was natural, “What do you intend to do next? Find a much bigger leg to hug?”

Ning Xi blinked, not understanding, “Hah? What do you mean, find a bigger leg to hug?”

“You said you wanted to find a big leg to hug last night, and even said that mine wasn’t big enough.” Lu Tingxiao looked at her meaningfully.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ning Xi coughed continuously, and was almost choked to death by her own saliva.

Damn it, just how many shenanigans had happened last night…

“Master Lu, I was too drunk last night, so don’t take my words to heart! Your leg is definitely big enough, the biggest leg to hug in the capital is yours!” Her face was full of flattery, but she felt like there was another meaning to her words after having said so…

Lu Tingxiao was in a good mood after getting flattered. Humour was rippling in his eyes as she said, “Then why won’t you hug mine?”

“I… I… I…” Ning Xi stammered for a while but couldn’t finish her sentence.

Lu Tingxiao rubbed her head and decided to let her off the hook, “Alright, I won’t tease you anymore. Let’s go back to the house to sleep, you’ll need your energy to overcome the challenges ahead. Or would you like to stay a while longer with your little darling?”

“No, no need for that, let’s go back to the house!” She was naturally eager to get out of the car.

After getting out of the car, Lu Tingxiao stood next to the car door and suddenly stopped moving.

Ning Xi scratched her head, “What happened?”

Lu Tingxiao strode over to a bush.

She followed curiously, and saw… Second Master Lu carrying a camera in his arms, sleeping soundly in the underbrush with limbs askew.

She knew that under the banner of Golden Age, there was not only a management company, but also over 300 media outlets. Second Master Lu was considered the boss of all the paparazzi.

But wasn’t this guy too ridiculous, he wouldn’t miss out even on his own brother’s gossip…

The corner of Ning Xi’s mouth twitched, “Second Master… this… should we wake him? Won’t he catch a cold like this?”

Lu Tingxiao nodded and kicked him.

Lu Jingli woke up with a shout.

He started crying the moment he woke, “You’re too much! Why are the windows of this car so impermeable! I couldn’t see inside no matter what I used!”

Lu Tingxiao looked down on his silly brother in a domineering manner, “Come to my study later, there’s something I want you to do for me.”

“Oh~” Lu Jingli rubbed his eyes and dusted himself off as he climbed to his feet. His gaze flitted nonstop between the two as he muttered, “Why didn’t the car shake! Don’t tell me that I missed the moment? That can’t be! With my brother’s stamina, the car should shake for a whole night at the very least…”

Ning Xi: “Why do you understand your brother’s stamina so well…”

It’s easy for people to misunderstand, you know!

Lu Jingli scratched his head, “That’s because when he beats me up, he lasts for the whole night!”

Ning Xi: “…”

Fine, you win!

After returning to the room Lu Tingxiao had prepared for her, Ning Xi was totally speechless.

In just one night and half a day, the guest room had been completely renovated.

The room’s style had originally been clean with cool tones, but it had been changed into a cosy room with warm tones. Not only that, the closet was filled with a row of clothes all in her size. From pajamas to home clothes to party dresses, even the accessories and handbags were all super ultra limited editions…

He was simply… inhumanly rich…
