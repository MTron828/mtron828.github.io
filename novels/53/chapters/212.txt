Chapter 213: It Is Better to Choose Lu Jingli

Translator: Henyee  Editor: Henyee

Ning Xi painfully pinched the skin between her eyebrows. “A human life is of greater value than anything. I had better go! What if he is someone I know! But what to do with Little Treasure…”

Before she could continue, Little Treasure tightly threw his arms around her neck, as if, after finally seeing her return, he would never separate from her.

Little Treasure wouldn’t let go no matter what, so Ning Xi would have to go with him.

Little Treasure wanted to follow her, so Lu Tingxiao definitely needed to join them.

And Lu Jingli actively volunteered to drive them.

Jiang Muye saw that the three people of the Lu family were all unashamedly ready to go, so he decidedly also squeezed into the car.

The final result was that everyone went with her.

Ning Xi was speechless.

At the hospital, several ambulances were at the door, the paramedics were bustling about, and the stretchers were full of bleeding patients, as if there had been a major traffic accident.

Ning Xi put her hands over Little Treasure’s eyes, to keep him from seeing these bloody things, and softly coaxed him. “Darling, it’s very messy now in the hospital. Would you please wait for me in the car?”

Little Treasure held her waist, his little head drooping as if he was being abandoned. He was actually so sleepy that he dozed off, but he still refused to sleep.

Ning Xi leaned over and kissed his little face. “Little Treasure, listen to me! I’ll be back very soon!”

Little Treasure, who had been kissed, recovered a bit and nodded.

“Then, I’m going!” Ning Xi said to all of them.

Lu Tingxiao: “I’ll go with you.”

Jiang Muye: “I want to go, too!”

Both spoke almost simultaneously.

Ning Xi: “…”

“You going alone is unsafe.” Lu Tingxiao frowned.

Jiang Muye snorted and said, “I just want to see who the hell he is!”

Ning Xi’s head hurt. She looked at Lu Tingxiao and then looked at Jiang Muye. Her eyes finally fell on Lu Jingli.

Lu Jingli innocently blinked. Why was his sister-in-law looking at him?

At last, Ning Xi spoke. “I don’t know the situation inside. It’s really improper for me to go alone. So, Second Young Master, please come with me! Lu Tingxiao, you… you’d better stay here to accompany Little Treasure!”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

There was a flicker of darkness in Lu Tingxiao’s eyes. “Ok.”

“As for you, Jiang Muye, stop this! Don’t you know how easily your face creates trouble? Running to a hospital so late at night, you want to create headlines, don’t you?”

Jiang Muye looked angry. Why are you so mad at me? But you speak so softly to Lu Tingxiao! Why?

“Go, go, go! Xiao Xixi, I’ll go with you! I’ll go with you!” Lu Jingli exulted. He was so excited that he almost danced on the spot.

Happiness came too suddenly! It was really a quarrel which benefited only the third party!

In the hospital’s Emergency Room.

It was a mess. It took Ning Xi a long time to find the doctor who had called her before.

“Hello, I’m Ning Xi. Where is the friend you mentioned before?”

“You’re Ning Xi! He has been through surgery and is now in Ward 307 on Floor 12. Go identify him quickly. He has nothing to prove his identity!”

“Ok, thank you!”

Ning Xi and Lu Jingli hurried to go upstairs, but the elevator was so crowded that they had to climb the stairs. Twelve floors! How miserable!

Ning Xi was terribly tired, while Lu Jingli was still cheerful like it was nothing.

She finally understood why Lu Jingli had been able to run Glory World Entertainment with such excellence. This guy’s passion for gossip was simply unmatched!
