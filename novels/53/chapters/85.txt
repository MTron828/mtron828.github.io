Chapter 86: Let The Storm Rage Even Harder

Ning Xi’s reputation had been dragged through the mud, and very miserably at that.

Yesterday in the middle of the night, a popular tabloid blogger on Weibo had published a long post. The title was “The story of how the scheming bitch Ning Xi got to the top, an unprecedentedly shameless person.”

The summary of the content was that she had slept with the director to get her role, and had gone around seducing wealthy old men to trick them into giving her gifts. She had even deliberately taken advantage of Jiang Muye while filming…

The post even said that when she was on set, her room door was always open. Anyone who wanted to sleep with her could walk right in and sleep with her. It made her sound like a total whore who was extremely easy and completely lacked any moral boundaries.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

This made Jiang Muye’s fans explode. They banded up to protest that their idol had been paired up with a woman like that and angrily demanded that the production crew change the second female lead.

The comments on Ning Xi’s most recent post were simply unbearable to look at. It was completely filled with angry curses. Everyone was yelling, “Ning Xi, get out from the entertainment industry!”…

“Have you seen it clearly now? Post a statement of apology to redeem the company’s image right now!” Chang Li angrily spat out an order.

Ning Xi sneered, “A statement of apology?”

Normally, when actors who were signed to a company encountered a situation like this, the company would organise a special public relations team to emphasise the actors’ innocence and perform damage control. Chang Li on the other hand…

As if Chang Li really wanted her to redeem the company’s image. Chang Li was only trying to thoroughly discredit her. Apologising would make it seem like she was admitting to everything that was written in that blog.

“That’s right. I had better see it before 8pm tonight. It would be best if it was a video since that looks more sincere! Otherwise, just wait till you’re kicked out of the cast! When the time comes, even the company won’t be able to protect you!” After Chang Li issued this threat, she ruthlessly hung up the phone with a smack.

After this call, Ning Xi was wide awake.

She had anticipated a situation like this long ago, but she hadn’t expected that the other party would act this quickly.

It looked like Jia Qingqing couldn’t even wait another second. With Ning Xueluo adding fuel to the flame, she had been thrown into a raging storm over the course of a single night.

Very well. Bring it on!

She had actually been worried that they wouldn’t make a move!

Ning Xi immediately got out of bed and washed up. Afterwards, she took out her cosmetic products and began to apply her makeup.

After half an hour, she looked at her face in the mirror. After putting on makeup, she had become haggard and pale, yet sweetly pitiful. She nodded her head in satisfaction.

Right after she cleaned up the table, there was a knock on the door.

Ning Xi stood up to open the door. Afterwards, she stared blankly. It was yesterday’s ‘pervert’, Lu Tingxiao.

After the events of last night, she actually felt a little weird looking at him now…

Without waiting for Ning Xi to speak, Lu Tingxiao saw her incomparably pale and haggard complexion and his expression immediately became incomparably ice-cold. Without another word, he picked up his phone and started to search for a contact.

Out of the corner of her eyes, Ning Xi saw his finger stop at the name Liang Feixing.

Liang Feixing was the director of public relations at Golden Age Entertainment. He had a pair of magic hands that had beautifully resolved the scandals of many actors and restored their reputations. He could be considered a model example for any public relations manager.

When Ning Xi saw this, she immediately reacted. Like a tiger, she lunged forward and snatched Lu Tingxiao’s phone. “Lu Tingxiao, what are you doing?”

“Settling the matter.” Lu Tingxiao’s complexion was extremely ugly, making it obvious that he had also found about the matter on the Internet.

“…” Ning Xi helplessly looked at her opponent, Big Boss, who wanted to help her cheat her way out without saying a single word.

The last time, when Lu Tingxiao had acted without a word and ordered Su Yimo’s personal stylist to help her out, she had already been shocked enough. At least no one had found out. If he did something like that again, she really wouldn’t be able to endure it.

If Golden Age Entertainment suddenly intervened under these crazy circumstances, she was going to get another label of being a traitor who was two-timing on the two companies.
