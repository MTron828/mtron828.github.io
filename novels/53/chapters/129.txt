Dusk was setting in a forest of bamboo.

Two women stood facing each other; one was dressed in vibrant red, and the other in flawless white.

Shangguan Yingrong had a solemn expression, “Meng Changge, I can understand that you were pursuing revenge for the sake of your brothers. However, you’ve already killed Consort Xian, isn’t that enough? Don’t tell me that you’re going to bring down the entire kingdom?”

Meng Changge’s long, red sleeves tossed and tumbled in the wind like a burning flame. She looked down on the person before her as if she was looking disdainfully on an ant, “This kingdom was won by the efforts of my Meng family. So what if I destroy it now?”

Shangguan Yingrong was enraged, “You… You’re too unreasonable! You were once a general who protected the soil of this country. Why have you become so petty? Don’t tell me you’re willing to see this land enveloped in the flames of war and the people still suffering a hundred years later?”

Meng Changge’s hair flew wildly in the wind. She cast her gaze downwards and stroked her perfect, long nails. In a crazed tone, she said, “Who cares if the world drowns after I die?”

“That’s perfect!” Guo Qisheng was so moved that he didn’t know how else to describe it.

Ye Linglong had specially come to the set today. After watching the scene, she let out a long sigh. She showed a relieved expression, “In this movie, the role I was the most worried about wasn’t Shangguan Yingrong, but Meng Changge. When I first created Meng Changge, I didn’t cast her as the villain on purpose. I’m leaving it to the audience to decide whether she’s a hero or a villain. As for how the audience can decide this, it’s all dependent on how the actress interprets the role. If the actress doesn’t have enough skill to play the role properly, then Meng Changge will be seen as the biggest villain of the movie. However, if the actress can pull it off, then Meng Changge’s depths would be shown perfectly.”

It was clear that Ning Xi was the latter.

Guo Qisheng’s expression was full of excitement. He said confidently, “I have a feeling that Ning Xi will get an award for her role!”

Wang Taihe nodded a few times, “She’s a good sprout. Although Starlight has lost Jia Qingqing, they still have a rising star, Ning Xi. They’ve practically profited from this!”

“Cut! Good work! Take a break before we start the next scene!”

Since they had cleared this scene in one take, Guo Qisheng’s earlier gloominess from Jiang Muye’s sudden leave was instantly lifted.

When they returned to the break room, Ning Xueluo called over her assistant the moment she sat down and inquired, “What was the director saying to the rest just now?”

The little assistant looked as if she wanted to speak, but didn’t know where to start.

“They praised Ning Xi?” Ning Xueluo sneered.

The little assistant nodded, “Director Guo said that Ning Xi acted perfectly. Screenwriter Ye said that Ning Xi’s acting was so good that she turned Meng Changge into the protagonist. Producer Wang also praised Ning Xi and said that she would probably go further than Jia Qingiqing. Director Guo even said…”

“What else did he say?”

“He said that Ning Xi might get an award for her role…” The little assistant said weakly.

Ning Xueluo slammed her hand on the armrest, “What a boast! Nowadays, awards are based on background, does he think that awards are given out without any support from behind the scenes? So what if she gets an award? At most, she can only get Best Supporting Actress. Isn’t she just there to be my foil!”

The little assistant quickly agreed, “It’s exactly as Xueluo-jie says! She’s just acting as a temptress, how can she compare with you? The audience isn’t blind!”

Ning Xueluo’s expression warmed a little, but the dark clouds in her eyes didn’t completely dissipate. She lowered her voice and said, “That thing we prepared before… it’s time for action!”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The little assistant cried out in surprise before hurriedly covering her mouth, “We’re really doing that? But, it’s too dangerous! What if you…”

“Stop dawdling. If I order you to do it, then go!” Ning Xueluo’s face was full of impatience.

“I got it, I’ll go tell that person now…”

At this moment, Su Yan’s concerned voice sounded from behind, “Xueluo, what happened? Your complexion don’t seem to look too well?”
