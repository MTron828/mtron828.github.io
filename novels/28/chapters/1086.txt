Chapter 1089 Dao Heavenly Race

Han Jue’s mood returned to normal after playing the simulation trial for a few days.

He didn’t leave the Daoist temple. Instead, he continued to wait for the Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison to end enslaving the target.

He looked outside the Daoist temple. The Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e were gathered together to cultivate. Their cultivation levels were at least at the mid-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm.

Han Jue wondered if he should tell them to go train outside.

It could be seen that these guys also yearned for the Chaos.

Han Jue created a clone and went to teach the Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e.

Time passed.

Millions of years later.

The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was finally enslaved.

[Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.] The Ultimate Origin Soul dissipated and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity condensed his main body. He knelt in front of him respectfully.

Han Jue asked some questions and instructed some things before sending the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity back to the blank domain.

The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity appeared in the blank domain. Just as he was about to fly back to his Great Dao World, the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable sent a voice

transmission to him.

The two Dao Creators appeared in a mysterious space.

“What happened earlier?” the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable asked.

“After I lost, I went to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s Dao Field to listen to the Dao. The Dao discussion during this period of time has benefited me greatly. I’m preparing to enter seclusion.”

“Just listening to the Dao?”

“Yes, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is an ascetic. He warned me that if I find trouble with him again, he won’t be so easy to talk to next time. I also promised not to scheme against the Ultimate Origin World.”

The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity’s answer made the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable

less confused.

That’s right.

The battle between Han Jue and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was not a spar. They were clearly angry. If that was the case, how could they discuss the Dao after the battle?

The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable gloated upon hearing that the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity had been warned by Han Jue.

He had always been unhappy with the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity. He had been bullied by this fellow before.

The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity snorted. “Is

there anything else? If you want to see a joke, I can let you experience my previous feelings.”

Nothing had changed!

He was still so domineering and arrogant.

The two Dao Creators chatted for a while before

leaving.

The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable came

to another mysterious space. The Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent

Deity were waiting here.

“How’s the situation?” the Chaotic

Consciousness asked.

“He’s fine. He was warned by the Divine Might

Heavenly Sage.

“The Divine Might Heavenly Sage can enslave the enemy. Has he been…”

“Impossible. We are Dao Creators. Even the

Chaos can only suppress us. How can we be enslaved? I see that his temperament and

words haven’t changed.”

“True.”

It sounded impossible to enslave a Dao Creator

and make him loyal to him.

Unless the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was

convinced, it was impossible for him to serve Han Jue willingly, especially after his defeat.

The Formless Transcendent Deity said, should wait and see.”

“We

The Chaotic Consciousness and the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable nodded.

Clearly, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage and

the Ninth Chaos would definitely fight in the

future.

The Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s performance

shocked the three Dao Creators when he battled the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity.

This child could already resist the Ninth Chaos!

The Chaotic Consciousness sighed. “Where did he come from? Could he be the reincarnation of an ancient existence before us?” The Formless Transcendent Deity and the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable nodded in

agreement.

They couldn’t answer.

At least, they thought that Han Jue definitely

had another identity. It was impossible for him to become so powerful in just three hundred million years. Perhaps Han Jue was the legendary Primordial Fiendcelestial?

No matter what, they realized that Han Jue was

no longer someone they could scheme against.

They could already see an unprecedented battle

coming.

What they could do now was to protect themselves and all the living beings in the Great Dao World.

310 million years old!

Han Jue called the Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e

into the Daoist temple.

The ten descendants were very excited. How

many years had it been? They had finally returned.

They looked at Han Jue carefully. After so many

years, Han Jue didn’t change at all, but they felt that he had become stronger.

The ancestor had been in seclusion for so long.

It was impossible for him to not have gained anything!

“Nine Divine Stars, I’ll send you on a mission.

Go to the Chaos and capture the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial,” Han Jue said.

The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial was the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential nurtured by Han Ling. Now in the Heavenly Court, this

fellow used the name of the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial and insulted Han Jue.

It was a good opportunity to train the Nine

Divine Stars.

Han Zongdao asked, “Are you going to reveal our identities?”

Han Jue said, “You can use the name of Nine

Divine Stars, but you can’t mention me or the

Hidden Sect.”

“Understood!”

The Nine Divine Stars were all excited and rubbed their palms together.

They could finally take action after waiting for

so many years.

Shan’e looked at Han Jue in anticipation after

the Nine Divine Stars left. Han Jue said, “Continue cultivating. The Dao of Curses is different from the Nine Divine Stars.

You have to hide in the dark in the future and stay by my side.”

Shan’e felt bitter, but he did not dare to refute. Han Jue smiled. “I’ll bring you out for a walk

when I’m free in the future.” Shan’e hurriedly thanked him.

Han Jue started to check his emails. Transcendent existences appeared less frequently, but the battles in the Chaos increased. Han Jue noticed an email. [Your good friend Dao Ancestor obtained the

help of your good friend Pangu to create a

Creation Race. His providence has increased greatly.]

Creation Race?

Han Jue was secretly curious. He deduced.

He discovered that Pangu and Hong Jun had

joined forces to create a Human Race. It looked identical to the Human Race, but its physique far exceeded that of the Heavenly Dao Human

Race.

This new race was called the Dao Heavenly

Race.

The Dao Heavenly Race was not in the Heavenly Dao but in a corner of the Chaos.

They didn’t reveal themselves for the time being.

The talent of this race was almost comparable to the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. It contained Pangu’s blood essence and the Dao Ancestor’s

Great Dao comprehension. It was indeed impressive. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Han Jue was only interested and had no intention of interfering. Pangu and the Dao Ancestor were already not

on the same level as him. In addition, the two

sides were not enemies, so he naturally would not suppress them.

No one’s cultivation speed could catch up to

his. Han Jue naturally wouldn’t suppress the juniors.

It was meaningless to be too invincible. It was also interesting for juniors to overestimate themselves and challenge him occasionally.

Previously, he was not strong enough and didn’t want to be disturbed. However, he was about to become invincible and naturally needed someone to disturb him.

It was not embarrassing to posture.

At the same time.

Transcendent Domain, Creation Emperor

Court.

Han Huang had just fused with a power that

transcended the Supreme Rules when his cultivation level increased greatly. The Formless Transcendent Deity had only

given

him the power divided by the Supreme Rules, not the Supreme Rules themselves. Otherwise, the Transcendent Domain would

have collapsed.

Han Huang

opened his eyes as killing intent

flashed across them.

His mentality also changed as he became

stronger.

He had looked down on the other races ever

since he was born, but he wouldn’t take the initiative to bully them. However, now, he

suddenly felt a little lonely.
