Chapter 249 Mysterious Door, Impending Danger

“What is it?” Han Jue stared at the White-Robed Buddha and asked. He carefully sized him up and felt that his cultivation level had increased.

He had to try the simulation trial when he returned. It had been too long since he had been taken seriously. He didn’t want to be overtaken by this fellow!

The White-Robed Buddha said nervously, “The Victorious Fighting Buddha is coming to kill me and your grand-disciple!”

Victorious Fighting Buddha?

Han Jue’s expression turned strange, and he asked, “Sun Wukong?” “What’s Sun Wukong?” “Oh, is the Victorious Fighting Buddha very strong?”

“Very strong. He’s the leader of the younger generation of the Buddhist Sect. He became an Immortal Emperor at a million years old!”

“A million years old is still considered young?” “Of course. In short, he’s very strong. I can’t defeat him. The Supreme Buddha is now a reincarnated person, so he can’t defeat him either.”

Han Jue fell into deep thought.

The White-Robed Buddha asked nervously, “Can you ask the Divine General to help? Otherwise, the two of us won’t be able to stop him.”

The mention of the Victorious Fighting Buddha terrified him.

Han Jue asked in surprise, “Is he really that terrifying?” “Yes. Previously, in the battle of Buddhism, he defeated a thousand Bodhisattvas and dozens of Buddhas. In the end, he was defeated by the Buddha Ancestor.”

“Yes, I understand. Go back and cultivate.”

“Thank you!”

The White-Robed Buddha heaved a sigh of relief.

Han Jue returned to the Connate Cave Abode. He first came to a simulation trial with the White-Robed Buddha.

Instant kill!

Sigh!

It was meaningless!

Han Jue chased Dao Comprehension Sword out and called the Heavenly Emperor to tell him about the Victorious Fighting Buddha. “I understand. I’ll get the Divine General to stop him!”

“Thank you, Your Majesty.”

Han Jue thanked him and took out the Book of Misfortune to curse the enemy.

The Heavenly Emperor shouldn’t be able to see the scene in the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain. Otherwise, when Han Jue cursed the Immortal Gods, he would have long been furious.

If Han Jue didn’t mention him, he probably wouldn’t be able to contact him directly. Han Jue couldn’t understand this method for the time being. He called Dao Comprehension Sword back in and continued cultivating.

Seven years later.

An old friend came to visit him. Elder Huang Zuntian of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect, who was once the Sect Master of the Raincoat Sect, was sent by Han Jue to be a spy in the Nine Dragons Sect. In the end, he directly seized the position.

Han Jue hesitated for a moment but still let him into the cave abode. No matter what, Huang Zuntian was still his subordinate. He had joined the Jade Pure Sacred Sect to please him.

Huang Zuntian knelt in front of Han Jue excitedly and kowtowed several times. Dao Comprehension Sword looked at him curiously.

To be able to make Han Jue make an exception to receive him, who was this person?

“Senior, I’ve already reached the Mahayana Realm. Can I join the Hidden Sect? I can put down everything, including my authority in the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. I’ve already contributed enough to the sect, more than the Sect Master, Xiao’e, and Liu Bumie,” Huang Zuntian asked carefully. Han Jue stared at him and didn’t say anything.

Thinking about it carefully, Huang Zuntian was also a talent.

Han Jue said, “Do you want to serve me or cultivate on the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain?”

Huang Zuntian was stunned. “Of course I want to serve you!”

Han Jue nodded and smiled. “You can cultivate outside. In a hundred years, you will ascend. At that time, I have a mission for you.”

Huang Zuntian was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly thanked him.

After he left the cave abode, Dao Comprehension Sword asked curiously, “Is his potential very strong? It feels average.”

The Mahayana Realm disciples of the Hidden Sect weren’t as weak as Huang Zuntian.

“He has something outstanding about him. It has nothing to do with cultivation,” Han Jue said softly before closing his eyes. Dao Comprehension Sword was even more curious.

Han Jue stopped thinking about Huang Zuntian and focused on his cultivation. As Han Jue cultivated the Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering Technique for longer and longer, not only did his cultivation level increase, but he also felt that the Stellar Primordial Body was changing

To be precise, it was awakening!

Somehow, he felt like he was approaching a mysterious door.

Once he opened that door, he might break through or receive an explosive increase in strength!

If he wanted to open this door, he had to fill every star in his body with Dharmic powers!

That day was not far away!

In high spirits, Han Jue continued cultivating.

In a dark palace.

The Sword God Emperor sat on a mat. His expression was slightly pale as he looked at the kneeling man with a complicated gaze.

“Su Qi, it’s good that you’re back,” the Sword God Emperor said insincerely.

Su Qi sighed. “I’ve been hunted by the Great Desolate Sacred Dynasty all these years, so I couldn’t return immediately. I hope that Palace Master won’t blame me.”

“How can that be? As long as you enter my Divine Palace, you will always be part of it.” The Sword God Emperor smiled, but he was very annoyed inside. The Great Desolate Sacred Dynasty was too weak. They actually let Su Qi run back.

Previously, on account of Han Jue, he had accepted Su Qi. He discovered that Su Qi’s bad luck was indeed terrifying and could easily harm the disciples around him. Therefore, he had sent him out on missions. Thanks to the blessing of heaven, the Grand Desolate Sacred Dynasty had courted death by suppressing Su Qi.

Unfortunately, after so many years, he had returned.

The Sword God Emperor had a headache. How should he deal with him?

“Palace Master, can I enter seclusion next?” Su Qi looked up and asked.

The Sword God Emperor smiled. “Of course.”

That was the best answer he could hear!

The two of them exchanged a few pleasantries before Su Qi left.

The Sword God Emperor was about to cultivate when a voice sounded in the hall.

“The Golden Crow Divine Clan’s Jiang Yi is here to cause trouble again. Sword God Emperor, go teach him a lesson!”

The Sword God Emperor frowned.

He cursed in his heart. Why was the Golden Crow Divine Clan so difficult to deal with?

Didn’t they reach a compromise previously? Why was he here again? Every time he came, he would have to face him, causing him to suffer. The Sword God Emperor sighed and stood up obediently.

Twenty years later.

Most of the stars in Han Jue’s body were filled with Dharmic powers. He was getting closer and closer to his limits.

He took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the enemies while checking his emails.

(Your good friend Sword God Emperor was attacked by your good friend Jiang Yi. Both sides were injured.]

(Your grand-disciple Fang Liang was chosen by a mighty figure to obtain the inheritance.]

(Your good friend Zhou Fan was attacked by a cultivator and was severely injured.)

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by evil ghosts] X259972

(Your good friend Huang Jihao was attacked by demons] x287430

(Your divine pet, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, has ascended.]

[Your divine pet, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, was attacked by a mighty figure and was captured.)

(Your good friend Divine General was attacked by a mighty figure and was severely injured.]

Han Jue frowned. That damned dog actually ascended and got caught.

To be labeled as a mighty figure by the system, he had to be an Immortal Emperor!

There was also the Divine General who was severely injured. Could it be that he was injured by the Victorious Fighting Buddha?

Han Jue immediately became nervous.

Was the Victorious Fighting Buddha so strong?

Even the Divine General could not defeat him?

Han Jue frowned even more.

Although he was flustered, Han Jue didn’t stop what he was doing.

He prepared to add the Victorious Fighting Buddha to the curse list.

In order to cause trouble, he cursed the Victorious Fighting Buddha for ten days, losing a hundred years of his lifespan. His heart ached.

After cursing, Han Jue continued cultivating.

He wanted to become an Immortal Emperor as soon as possible. This way, he would have the strength to fight the Victorious Fighting Buddha. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Even if he couldn’t win, he could at least escape.

Half a year later.

He heard a familiar voice.

“Sima Yi, come out and tell me a story.”
