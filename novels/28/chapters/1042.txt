Chapter 1044 Appearance of the Deity

Although Shi Tian was in chaos, that was only for the environment. Many places were still peaceful and not harmed.

Han Jue and the other two came to a great world at the edge of Shi Tian. It was like the Earth in the Milky Way. It lay quietly in the corner of the void, lonely and beautiful. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The living beings in this world were very weak. The strongest living being was only an Immortal Emperor. No wonder they were not affected. Of course, they would probably not be able to escape the outcome of being destroyed if they encountered cultivators who wanted to slaughter them.

The three of them entered the world. Countless mortal worlds gathered around this world like the Heavenly Dao. They were still dominated by humans. To be precise, they were a race with Connate Dao Physique. They had different names in different worlds.

With the cultivation of Han Jue and the other two, they could directly understand the language of this world. There was no obstacle in communication.

They first entered a mortal world and began to travel.

Han Jue chatted and laughed with them as he looked into the depths of Shi Tian.

Another huge battle erupted!

He saw some familiar figures. Han Tuo, Yi Tian, Han Huang, Han Ye, Han Yao, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Han Bashen, Zhao Shuangquan, Huang Zuntian, Ji Xianshen, and so on.

They were all fighting for a Supreme Rule. How lively.

As they fought, everyone began to besiege Han Huang because he was too powerful.

Even Han Tuo had to admit that his second brother had already far surpassed him.

The three of them arrived at a town and felt the culture there.

It was impossible for the three of them to encounter trouble with their cultivation

levels. Even if someone dared to find trouble with them, they could resolve it with a

thought.

After the three of them walked for more than a thousand worlds, the chaotic battle in the depths of Shi Tian continued.

Since they had nothing to do, Han Jue and the

other two stopped on a cliff. Han Jue waved his hand and created a screen of light, revealing the scene of a chaotic battle.

The two women watched curiously.

Chang Yue’er saw Han Yao displaying his Mystical Power and couldn’t help but sigh. “Time passed so quickly. Junior Han’s descendants are already so strong.”

Fairy Xi Xuan smiled. “That’s right. Although

there’s a huge difference in seniority between us and them, in terms of experience, we’re far inferior to them.”

She looked at Han Jue with a gentle gaze. The greatest providence in her life was when she accepted Han Jue as her disciple.

Chang Yue’er asked curiously, “Junior Han, who do you think will laugh in the end?

Huang’er, Tuo’er, or your other descendants? That Han Yao, Han Ye, and Han Bashen are

very powerful when they join forces.”

“If there’s no surprise, it’s Huang’er, but wanting to obtain that rule is wishful

thinking.”

“Why? He can’t obtain it even if he wins?”

“Yes, there’s a conspiracy behind this. It involves the existence who created this Great World. His cultivation level is extraordinary. He can’t be named or discussed, so I won’t introduce him to you,” Han Jue replied. Chang Yue’er and Fairy Xi Xuan looked at each other.

Shi Tian was an existence comparable to the Chaos. Such a world was actually created by a mighty figure?

They couldn’t imagine it. Could there really be

a Creation God?

Chang Yue’er asked curiously, “Junior Han, what realm are you at now? Can you compare to the transcendent existence who established

Shi Tian?”

Han Jue said, “I can barely compare, but he

has cultivated countless years earlier than me. If we really fight to the death, I’m naturally

not his match.”

Chang Yue’er frowned.

She thought that Han Jue was already the

strongest, but she didn’t expect there to be stronger existences.

“The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is really

humble. Your ability has already surpassed mine.”

A voice entered Han Jue’s ears.

It was the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable.

Han Jue replied in his mind, “Fellow Daoist,

don’t worry. I’m only here to play. I won’t harm Shi Tian.”

The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s voice sounded, “I hope so. I’m also worried that the juniors will be rash and rude.” Han Jue replied in his mind, “You’re thinking

too much. I’m also afraid that you’ll destroy my Great Dao World.”

The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable

snorted and did not say anything else.

From the beginning to the end, Chang Yue’er

and Fairy Xi Xuan did not hear their conversation. They were still nervously watching the battle.

Even if their cultivation levels were insufficient and they could not see the details of the battle, from the scene, they could barely tell who had the upper hand. Han Huang fought more than a hundred Great

Dao Sages alone. He was extremely domineering. His strength was clearly on par with his other opponents.

The three of them continued on their way after watching for several hours. There were many wonders in Shi Tian’s

world. Several days later, they met in the void.

In the dark void stood a lake that emitted seven-colored light. That’s right, it was a lake. It was tens of billions of kilometers long and wide. The land and a forest formed a circle that surrounded the lake. Han Jue could feel that it contained extremely

dense Spirit Qi. Not only that, but there were

also the Great Dao of Time and Space hidden inside.

In other words, this lake could connect the

past and the future, traveling through the past and present.

“So beautiful!” Chang Yue’er exclaimed in

surprise. It was all thanks to her that this trip was not so boring.

Han Jue felt like he was raising his daughter with Fairy Xi Xuan. Fairy Xi Xuan frowned. “There are many powerful auras inside. Let’s take a detour.”

Chang Yue’er waved her hand and said, “Master, what are you thinking? With Junior Han around, what are you afraid of? Could it

be that Shi Tian’s master is lying inside?”

Fairy Xi Xuan was still very hesitant. She looked at Han Jue. He smiled and said, “There’s indeed a Great

Dao Sage and its companion hidden inside. They’re not too strong. We can go in and take a look.” Fairy Xi Xuan heaved a sigh of relief. Since Han Jue said that, he definitely didn’t care about the existence inside.

To those at the Freedom Realm, there was no difference between a Great Dao Sage and a Great Dao Supreme. That was why she was so

hesitant, not knowing if the existence inside threatened Han Jue.

The three of them quickly entered the Seven-Colored Mountain Lake. The existences

hidden in the lake and forest did not sense

them. Chang Yue’er and Fairy Xi Xuan guessed that

it was Han Jue’s doing.

How terrifying. He had numbed the other

party without anyone knowing.

The two women toured curiously, while Han

Jue’s thoughts drifted.

Han Huang began to borrow his Ultimate

Origin Power again.

He had to control it cautiously, afraid that

Han Huang would explode. Even a wisp of Ultimate Origin Power was

enough for Han Huang to deal with the danger in front of him. Then again, what was that?

A mysterious and strange existence appeared

in Han Huang’s hand.

Han Jue found it familiar.

…

Wasn’t that the Strange Deity? The Strange Deity was released by Han Jue a

long time ago. At first, this fellow would return and then disappear. Han Jue deduced that it was not in danger and didn’t care. The Strange Deity was very similar to the Inauspicious Evil. All living beings couldn’t spy on it, but it could attack living beings. The current Strange Deity had already condensed a physical body. Han Jue had only forgotten to pay attention to it several times.

in seclusion recently. He didn’t expect it to grow to this extent.

Great Dao Supreme! There was something wrong with its body.

Although Han Huang’s attack could kill it, it quickly recovered. Undying and indestructible, its recovery speed

was extremely fast!
