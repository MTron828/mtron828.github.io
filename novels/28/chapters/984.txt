Chapter 987 Don’t Fight Before the Assembly

“If not for the fact that you accidentally entered my domain back then, it would have been difficult for you to interact today. I’ve been observing you,” the Formless Transcendent Deity said slowly, causing the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s heart to beat faster.

What had the Evil Heavenly Emperor not experienced before? He naturally understood what the other party meant.

The expert was recruiting him as a trusted aide.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor fell silent and did not reply immediately.

!!

It looked like a huge opportunity, but it was also a huge danger.

To make the Formless Transcendent Deity recruit him, the latter had to have enemies of the same realm. There was no way back once he agreed.

He could only walk this path to the end!

The Formless Transcendent Deity was not in a hurry. He patiently waited for his reply.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor recalled his past experiences. He had always chosen a strong backing in the past.

Now, the strongest backing he knew was right in front of him. What was he hesitating about?

Although Han Jue was the publicly acknowledged strongest in the Chaos, the Evil Heavenly Emperor knew that the person in front of him was even more extraordinary. He did not enter the Chaos and was outside the order. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The Evil Heavenly Emperor took a deep breath and asked, “Senior, what do you want me to do?”

Previously, when he faced the Formless Transcendent Deity, he did not want to be related. Now that he had joined the camp, he would definitely have to humble himself.

“I will help you reach the Great Dao Supreme Realm and create a great opportunity like the Chaos. Before that, the Heavenly Court still has to recruit geniuses and accumulate strength,” the Formless Transcendent Deity said slowly, causing the Evil Heavenly Emperor to frown.

“Don’t worry about Han Huang and the others. What I want is also what Han Jue wants. This matter has to start from the realm above the Great Dao…”

The Formless Transcendent Deity began to introduce the Dao Creator Realm. The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s expression changed drastically as he listened.

There was actually such a realm above the Chaos…

The Evil Heavenly Emperor didn’t even know how big the Chaos was. He was naturally shocked now that he was participating in the creation of the Chaos.

“So Han Jue has already reached this level… There’s also Laozi, the Dao Ancestor, and the Great Dao World below the Chaos…”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s eyes flickered. He finally understood.

He wanted to overthrow the Lord of Chaos!

The Formless Transcendent Deity planned to use him as a pawn. If this did not work, he could take the blame. If it succeeded, it would naturally be a great opportunity.

Splitting the Chaos and taking drastic measures!

In that case, it was indeed what Han Jue wanted.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “Alright, I’ll do as you say. But Han Huang, Han Qing’er, Jiang Jueshi, Zhao Shuangquan, Azure Heaven Mystic, and the War Buddha can only follow my instructions.”

The Formless Transcendent Deity said, “The matters of the Heavenly Court are all under your instructions. My only instruction is that if you succeed, the Heavenly Court will be your Great Dao World. The geniuses and immortals will still belong to you.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked carefully, “Could it be that you…”

“That’s right. I also have a Great Dao World that has existed for countless years. It’s just that it’s obstructed by the Chaos, so you don’t have to worry. I still look down on the geniuses of the Chaos.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor secretly heaved a sigh of relief at the Formless Transcendent Deity’s answer.

As the Evil Heavenly Emperor was thinking, a boundless force suddenly descended and landed on him, causing his entire body to tremble. His consciousness fell into chaos as endless memories and comprehension burst forth in his mind, shaking his soul.

Another five hundred thousand years passed.

Han Jue became 15 million years old. The Ultimate Origin Qi in the Ultimate Origin World had already reached 30%. More and more Chaotic Fiendcelestials encountered the Ultimate Origin Qi and used it to cultivate.

Han Jue’s strength also increased greatly.

He began the simulation trial and challenged another hundred Nine-Headed Divine Spirits. This time, the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion annihilated the enemies in less than a breath of time.

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit was no longer Han Jue’s match.

However, he was still a good whetstone.

Han Jue next challenged a thousand Nine-Headed Divine Spirits.

How powerful was the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit? The aura of a thousand of them was enough to crush the entire Chaos. However, the simulation trial’s space was endless. They could fight as they pleased.

The simulation trial ended less than an hour later.

Han Jue understood his strength and stopped fighting. He checked his emails next.

There were still 150,000 years until the Chaotic Assembly. To Han Jue, it was already very close.

From the emails, it proved this.

The emails in the past five hundred thousand years were many times more than before. His friends had gone mad!

Even Murong Qi and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial began to become active. They kept attacking and obtaining opportunities.

After reading the emails, Han Jue stood up and said, “Ling’er, follow me to see your brother.”

Han Ling, who was cultivating, opened her eyes and immediately stood up.

The father and daughter disappeared from the Daoist temple.

Thunderclouds surged and the ground was vast. The half-naked Yi Tian enjoyed the tempering of the lightning.

A million kilometers away, Han Tuo sat above the endless sea. Strong winds circled around him and his robes fluttered. He really looked like a true god in the sky, insufferably arrogant.

Han Jue and Han Ling appeared at the distant sea and looked up at Han Tuo.

Han Ling sighed. “Is that Big Brother? How powerful.”

She had the Primordial Emperor Star, so her senses were naturally extraordinary. She could sense Han Tuo’s strength. Even she might not win.

“It’s alright, but it’s still far inferior to your second brother,” Han Jue said softly.

The conversation between the father and daughter was isolated by the Ultimate Origin Power and was not heard by the Five Great Divine Punishers.

Han Ling raised her eyebrows and asked, “Is Father coming to guide Big Brother? After all, the Chaotic Assembly is about to begin.”

Han Jue smiled and sent a voice transmission to Han Tuo.

Han Tuo suddenly opened his eyes and knelt down in front of him. He suppressed his excitement and said, “Greetings, Father!”

His voice was loud. Yi Tian and the other three Divine Punishers immediately rushed over and bowed to Han Jue.

Han Jue smiled secretly. This kid dared to play tricks.

This was a fortuitous encounter for his brothers!

Han Jue didn’t expose them and smiled. “Get

up.”

“Hehe. Senior, I’ve always called myself your godson. You won’t be angry, right? Just accept me. I’m a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, after all. I won’t embarrass you.”

Yi Tian chuckled and rubbed his hands together.

Han Jue smiled and said, “I may take you in if you can become one of the Chaotic Ten Absolutes.”

Yi Tian’s eyes lit up. He was indeed not confident in the Eternal Peak, but he had to take one of the spots among the Chaotic Ten Absolutes!

He began to brag. The four Divine Punishers and Han Ling couldn’t help but laugh.

Han Jue interrupted him and introduced Han Ling to them.

“It’s indeed Sister Han Ling. I’ve heard about her from Qing’er.”

Han Tuo was very happy, and the other Divine Punishers were secretly shocked.

They all knew that Han Tuo had another younger sister. How long had it been? She had actually attained the Great Dao. Furthermore, this aura was definitely not at the early-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm!

“Is Sister Ling’er also participating in the Chaotic Assembly?” Yi Tian asked curiously.

Han Ling smiled and said, “I don’t dare to participate. I don’t like fighting and can’t win against you.”

The Divine Punishers heaved a sigh of relief.

They did not believe her. They had been through hundreds of battles and were all Great Dao Sages, but they couldn’t see through Han Ling. What did this mean?
