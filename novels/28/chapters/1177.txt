Chapter 1179 New Generation

A new Chaos had been completely born ever since the Dao Ancestor became a Dao Creator. Pangu had fused his Great Dao World with the Dao Ancestor’s. For a time, the Chaos’

reputation spread widely, not the least inferior to the Primordial Chaos.

All living beings knew that the Chaos would grow into a colossus. It was unstoppable. Thus, the various factions befriended it.

However, at this moment, danger arrived at the Chaos.

The bloodline that the Dao Heavenly Race had sacrificed the entire race to protect had actually grown into a Great Dao Supreme and begun to wreak havoc in the Chaos.

The Dao Ancestor and Pangu still felt a little guilty towards the Dao Heavenly Race, so they did not interfere, causing all the living beings in the Chaos to fall into uneasiness.

The person who inherited the Dao Heavenly Race’s providence was called Dao Heaven. Originally, this was not his name. But he changed his name to Dao Heaven after awakening his memories. Dao Heaven was his

true name now.

Dao Heaven was not alone. He had acknowledged three masters.

Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi were still famous in the Endless Era. After all, they were mighty figures who had survived the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity and were also creating their Great Dao Worlds.

With their support, the mighty figures who wanted to please the Dao Ancestor did not dare to attack. This caused Dao Heaven to be like a fish in water.

This matter attracted the attention of the entire Endless Era.

Especially after knowing Dao Heaven’s

background, this matter became even more dramatic.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Han Jue was also interested and started to pay attention to Dao Heaven.

Dao Sovereign and the other two supported Dao Heaven purely for revenge. They wanted to take revenge on Laozi for fusing with Lao Dan. Laozi was also the Dao Ancestor’s eldest

disciple. After the Dao Ancestor appeared, the master and disciple became very close.

Laozi also focused on dodging them.

Han Jue retracted his gaze after watching for a while.

He was really envious of the Dao Ancestor.

He still had enemies.

Han Jue already felt the loneliness of

invincibility. That so-called white-haired man was also in the distant future. Other than

cultivating, there were very few things that interested him now.

He even had ill intentions. Should he let the Endless Era be in chaos just to tease him?

Forget it, the Endless Era was not powerful enough. He could give the Endless Era a calamity when more Dao Creators appeared.

At Han Jue’s cultivation level, all living beings were meaningless in his eyes. He only did things based on his heart.

Han Jue looked at the others.

Mainly his grandson, Han Liang, and Chu

Xiaoqi.

Han Liang’s cultivation level kept increasing with the two Dao Creators’ help. Chu Xiaoqi was also not bad with the Primordial Chaos’ help. It was equivalent to having the support of three Dao Creators.

Although these two grandsons had never met, they had already become the targets of comparison among their peers.

In their generation, basically no one was more outstanding than them. Furthermore, they were all highly regarded by the Dao Creators.

Between the two of them, who could become a Dao Creator earlier had already become the topic of conversation among the cultivators. Han Jue was satisfied upon seeing that his two grandsons were developing well.

He closed his eyes again and continued cultivating.

…

In the void.

A black-robed man was advancing. He was burly and had an ancient face. His blood-colored hair fluttered wantonly like flames.

He was Dao Heaven, the Dao Heavenly Race’s

last bloodline.

He advanced very quickly and leaped through

the void to arrive at a lonely continent. The terrain of this continent was flat, barren, and

lonely.

In the center of the continent, three figures meditated facing each other. Three terrifying auras fused together, causing the nearby space to fluctuate as if it would be destroyed at any

moment.

Dao Heaven landed behind the three of them

and knelt down.

Zhao Xuanyuan asked without opening his eyes, “Why are you here?”

Dao Heaven said, “I don’t want revenge anymore.”

Zhao Xuanyuan was silent.

Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi did not speak and

continued cultivating.

Dao Heaven took a deep breath and said, “I

went to the Chaos and suddenly understood why the Dao Heavenly Race disappeared. They restricted the development of the Chaos and the Dao Ancestor had no choice but to take

action. The fact that the Dao Ancestor could

keep me is already the greatest kindness to the Dao Heavenly Race.”

Zhao Xuanyuan smiled. “It’s good that you’ve thought it through. However, we’ve put so much pressure on you. Where will our reputation go if you suddenly stop?” Dao Heaven was moved. He kowtowed to the

ground and did not look up.

Jiang Yi added, “So be it if you don’t want

revenge anymore. What are you going to do

next?”

Zhao Xuanyuan was only joking. Actually, they were also open-minded about Lao Dan, but if they could disgust the Dao Ancestor and Laozi, they were still willing.

Now, their conflict with Laozi and the Dao

Ancestor was only a small fight. Both sides did

not take it seriously, but Dao Heaven felt heavy

pressure.

Dao Heaven said in a low voice, “Masters, please punish me. I no longer dare to expect anything!”

He had wreaked havoc in the Chaos for millions

of years. At first, he was very happy, but he got tired of it as time passed. He began to investigate the past. After understanding the truth, he was confused again.

His duty was to take revenge. What should he do now that he was not taking revenge? He didn’t want to do anything else now. At

least, he wanted to obtain the forgiveness of his three masters. He knew very well the reason he could act recklessly. Other than the Dao Ancestor’s benevolence, he also used the influence of his three masters. Otherwise, those mighty figures who wanted to please the Dao Ancestor could crush him at any time. Zhao Xuanyuan said strangely, “Punish? How? I asked you to apologize to the Dao Ancestor and say that it’s all your obsession and has nothing to do with us?”

Dao Heaven was silent. Although he did not

want revenge, he did not like the Dao Ancestor

either. No matter what, the Dao Ancestor had indeed caused the Dao Heavenly Race’s destruction. At most, he would no longer interact with him.

Dao Sovereign opened his eyes and said, “Alright, stop teasing him.”

He looked at Dao Heaven and continued, “It’s best if you understand. Actually, it’s impossible for you to take revenge. After all, the Dao Ancestor is a Dao Creator. The three of us are

not his match even if we join forces. We don’t expect you to do anything for us. We took you

in as a disciple because we admire your courage and unyielding backbone.”

Dao Heaven looked up at him. This First Master

was the strictest in the past. He did not expect him to be the most tolerant now. Zhao Xuanyuan smiled. “Let’s cultivate here

for now. I think it’s unreliable to ask him to catch up to Chu Xiaoqi and Han Liang.” Jiang Yi opened his eyes and said, “Try. Even if

he fails, he has at least grown.’ Chu Xiaoqi and Han Liang? Dao Heaven felt that these two names were

familiar. He thought about it carefully and was immediately moved.

to

“Those two are already breaking through to the Dao Creator Realm. Can I still catch up them?” Dao Heaven asked with a trembling

voice.

Zhao Xuanyuan smiled. “By the way, you still don’t know our identities?” Dao Heaven looked at them and said, “I indeed

don’t know. Could it be that you are also Dao Creators?”

Zhao Xuanyuan’s face twitched. He suddenly wanted to cripple his disciple. Jiang Yi said, “We’re all from the Hidden Sect.

Han Liang and Chu Xiaoqi are equivalent to our junior disciples.”

Dao Heaven was enlightened and looked at his

three masters with admiration. Hidden Sect.

To be able to be the elder of Han Liang and Chu

Xiaoqi was definitely an eternal legend!
