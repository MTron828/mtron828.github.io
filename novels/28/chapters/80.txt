Chapter 81: Body Integration Realm, Senior Xuan

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In a cave, Xing Hongxuan looked warily at the gray-robed elder.

The gray-robed elder snorted and said, “Little girl, your husband can’t possibly be more talented than my disciple. Give up on him. I can let bygones be bygones and bring you to the Formless Sect. This is a great opportunity that many people dream of.”

This gray-robed elder was Enlightened Old Monster.

Xing Hongxuan had accidentally entered this cave decades ago to comprehend a cultivation technique. She had met Enlightened Old Monster by chance. However, the two of them had only nodded to each other and did not speak much.

Later, when Enlightened Old Monster left, Xing Hongxuan also returned to the Jade Pure Sect. Recently, Xing Hongxuan felt that something was missing, so she rushed back to this mystic realm and found this cave to continue cultivating the divine technique.

Coincidentally, Enlightened Old Monster returned. He was shocked to discover that she had already mastered the technique and wanted to take her in as his disciple.

Xing Hongxuan rejected him at first, but since he kept pestering her, she had to admit that she was already married.

Enlightened Old Monster had a high cultivation level. After calculating with his fingers, he realized that Xing Hongxuan was not fated to be married. Xing Hongxuan could only helplessly say that she had already agreed to marry an elder from the same sect. This infuriated Enlightened Old Monster. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

This was also the reason why Han Jue received four stars of hatred.

Xing Hongxuan shook her head. “Thank you for your kind intentions, Senior. I really don’t want to leave my husband.”

On the other side, Han Jue also discovered their conversation through the Heavenly Puppet.

Han Jue felt that it was impossible for there to be hatred for no reason, so he started checking from the three Heavenly Puppet. As expected, he found Enlightened Old Monster here.

Enlightened Old Monster said helplessly, “Little girl, your Great Yan is only a small place. As for the Jade Pure Sect, I’ve never heard of it. This mystic realm is connected to many places. If you join the Formless Sect, you’ll be able to see a wider world. As long as you’re willing, I can conceal your information. Think about it for a while longer. Ten years later, I’ll come again. If you’re willing, you can cut off all ties and wait for me here.”

With that, Enlightened Old Monster left.

After Han Jue heard that, he was secretly angry.

So you’re here to steal her from me.

He couldn’t help but use his divine sense to observe Xing Hongxuan’s expression.

After Enlightened Old Monster left, Xing Hongxuan revealed a look of disdain.

She shook her head and continued to study the cultivation technique on the cave wall.

Not bad. She wasn’t tempted.

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

Han Jue used his interpersonal relationships to check on Enlightened Old Monster.

[Enlightened Old Monster: Seventh level of the Body Integration Realm, Sect Master of the Formless Sect, a great expert. Because you are the husband of his beloved disciple’s prospective wife, he is dissatisfied with you. If Xing Hongxuan agrees to leave with him, he will kill you to prevent all future troubles. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]

The Sect Master of the Formless Sect.

Han Jue touched his chin and fell into deep thought.

After a while, he began the simulation trial, raising Dian Su’s cultivation level to the seventh level of the Body Integration Realm.

It took him two minutes to defeat him.

Enlightened Old Monster was definitely stronger.

I can’t kill him instantly. That’s an issue.

It looked like he had to break through to the Body Integration Realm as soon as possible.

Han Jue immediately held his breath and sought to reach the perfected Void Amalgamation Realm as soon as possible.

…

Five years later.

Han Jue finally reached the perfected Void Amalgamation Realm. Before he broke through, he took out the Book of Misfortune and cursed Enlightened Old Monster for four days and four nights straight before heading to the Ten Thousand Demon Realm to break through.

He first contacted Daoist Jingxu to clear the Ten Thousand Demon Realm.

Daoist Jingxu did not delay and immediately made arrangements.

Li Qingzi had instructed her that she must satisfy all of Han Jue’s requests immediately and not be negligent.

Four hours later, the disciples at the Ten Thousand Demon Realm were chased out by the various elders. This caused a huge commotion in the inner sect. But when they heard that it was the Deity Slaying Elder’s request, all the disciples were no longer unhappy.

The Body Integration Realm’s tribulation was terrifying. Even when Han Jue activated the barrier, it still caused a huge commotion. The elders gathered and felt the vast heavenly might, all of them trembling in fear.

“How strong is Deity Slaying Elder?”

“Looking at the commotion, he has probably surpassed the ancestor.”

“Stop marveling. How can the cultivation will of the Deity Slaying Elder be compared to us?”

“This is not something that can be achieved through cultivation alone. His talent is definitely the strongest in the Jade Pure Sect.”

“With the Deity Slaying Elder around, the Jade Pure Sect became as powerful as it is today. Most importantly, he did not consolidate his authority. It’s admirable.”

Listening to the elders’ discussion, Li Qingzi held his head high as if he was bragging.

Guan Yougang had a complex expression. He looked at the apocalyptic scene in the distance, his eyes filled with awe.

At this point, he didn’t blame Han Jue at all. Instead, he started to cultivate with Han Jue as his target.

Unfortunately, the gap between them still grew.

“Perhaps one day, he can ascend to become a true immortal.” Guan Yougang thought silently.

…

On a wasteland, a half-naked man sat in mid-air. Countless bolts of lightning descended from the sky and intertwined with his body.

This person was Zhou Fan!

Not far away, Mo Fuchou and a woman in a purple dress stood side by side.

After so many years, Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou were no longer young and immature. They had matured and their aura was even more powerful. Zhou Fan’s body had a visual impact during the tribulation. It was like the sacred body of an ancient god, indestructible.

Carrying a sword on his back, Mo Fuchou had a demonic aura.

He asked, “Senior, what relationship do you have with my Junior Brother? How can you be so generous?”

Not only had the purple-dressed woman resurrected Zhou Fan, but she had also helped him cultivate. Under her guidance, Zhou Fan’s strength had soared.

Now, Zhou Fan was breaking through to the Nascent Soul realm. In fact, his strength was already comparable to a Nascent Soul realm cultivator, having previously killed one himself!

“This junior brother of yours was fated to be with me in my previous life. He saved me once. I’m still indebted to him.”

Previous life?

Mo Fuchou couldn’t help but be curious.

The purple-robed woman said wistfully, “Speaking of which, it’s still his providence that’s powerful. The opportunities he obtained previously made him sufficiently powerful. I’m just taking advantage of the situation. In the future, he will stir up a storm in the world. Perhaps, he will reach the Mahayana realm again.”

Again?

Mo Fuchou was secretly shocked. Could it be that Zhou Fan was a Mahayana cultivator in his previous life?

“He’s about to succeed. I have to leave as well. To save him, I asked my senior sister for a favor. I have to return it.” The purple-robed woman shook her head. With that said, she turned around and prepared to leave.

Mo Fuchou hurriedly asked, “May I ask for Senior’s Dao title, how will we repay you in the future?”

The purple-robed woman leaped up. A cloud appeared beneath her feet, carrying her to the horizon. Her voice entered Mo Fuchou’s ears: “It’s best that you don’t know my Dao title, lest you attract trouble. The only thing I can tell you is that my surname is Xuan.”

Xuan?

Mo Fuchou frowned. Thinking back, he had never heard of a powerful cultivator with the surname Xuan.

He looked at Zhou Fan again.

…

Ten Thousand Demon Realm.

After ten days and ten nights of tribulation transcendence, Han Jue finally succeeded.

Body Integration Realm!

He had finally reached the Body Integration Realm. He was extremely excited.

[Detected that you have successfully broken through to the Body Integration Realm. You have the following choices:]

[1: Come out immediately and show the world how powerful you are. You can obtain a Numinous Treasure and a Mystical Power inheritance.]

[2: Continue to cultivate in seclusion. Cultivate in a low profile. The target is to be the strongest in the world. You can obtain a natural treasure.]
