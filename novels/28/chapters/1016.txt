Chapter 1017 Karma of the Great Calamity

Countless inheritances of the system fell into Han Jue’s eyes, causing his heart to stir.

Han Jue was afraid.

He had also faced the problems these inheritors had faced. Fortunately, he kept his bottom line.

But then again, those inheritors only faced external bewitchment. He was different. The system would try to bewitch him every time it gave him a choice.

!!

Damn it!

The Creation Will replied, “No, you represent the unknown. The unknown represents hope. While waiting for the successful person to appear, I suffered the backlash of all existences and no longer exist. What you face is the remnant will I left in the system. I won’t restrain you. I won’t interfere no matter what you do in the future. I look forward to what kind of existence you will become.”

Han Jue didn’t believe all of this.

He asked, “Why did you choose me?”

“That’s your luck. Every chosen successor has such doubts. I can’t answer them. It can only be your providence.”

Han Jue wasn’t too satisfied with the answer.

He asked, “Why is my Dao Field stronger than my cultivation level? Why aren’t there any previous inheritors?”

“As I constantly changed inheritors, the system became stronger. When you die, this opportunity will find the next successor, and the help he receives will also be greater than

yours.”

The Creation Will paused for a moment and continued, “The reason why I tested you when you were chosen was also that you wasted nearly a fifth of a mortal’s lifespan for good providence. Such a situation is unprecedented.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Han Jue said, “Thank you for your praise.”

“It’s not a compliment.”

Han Jue was stunned, not understanding what the Creation Will meant.

He asked, “Can you control the system?”

“No, I’m only a remnant will. I can’t have a substantial effect on any existence.”

“Then, do you have anything to say to me?”

Han Jue’s Dao heart didn’t change after he understood the system’s past. Anyway, it was right to maintain his previous attitude.

The Creation Will was silent. The edge of the huge sun in the distance began to fluctuate, as if the heat was scorching the sky.

After a long while…

The Creation Will’s voice slowly floated over. “Just like the Heavenly Dao, although the Heavenly Dao gives birth to a will, the Heavenly Dao itself also exists. Unconsciously, there is always a power that restricts the development of all of this. As for what it is, I’m not sure either. Even I can’t imagine what exists outside of all of this. What’s the meaning of my birth?

“Perhaps you can see through the meaning of existence when you reach the Creator Lord Realm.”

With that, the illusion shattered.

“Remember, the strongest is not eternal. Even if you’re the strongest, you will be surpassed sooner or later if you stop cultivating. There is no lack of strongest people from various eras among the previous inheritors. Most of them got lazy and were surpassed by those who came later.

“Always remember how you got to this point.”

The Creation Will’s voice became more and more ethereal.

Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality. It was still very noisy on Buzhou Mountain. The Flying Heaven Sect and the Han family had yet to come to a conclusion.

Han Jue felt bored.

It turned out that he was not the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s reincarnation. He was only one of the countless inheritors chosen.

He had been thinking too much.

Before this, he was still wondering if he was the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s reincarnation. Before he died, he had created a golden finger for himself, or that the system was given by the future him.

He had seen an online novel on Earth in the past. It was set like this.

He had to be wary of the so-called Creation Will.

Han Jue felt that this fellow’s self-introduction was a little dangerous. Why would he leave behind a remnant will if he had no desires?

Han Jue didn’t ask the system. He couldn’t tell if the Creation Will could control the system.

No matter what, he had to work hard to become stronger.

The Creator Lord Realm was not enough!

In order to be stable, he had to at least surpass the Creator Lord Realm before he could challenge the goal mentioned by the Creation Will.

Han Jue couldn’t act according to others’ thoughts. He had to always be ahead of others and above them.

Han Ling couldn’t help but laugh. “Father, these so-called mighty figures in the Immortal World are like mortals. They’re boring.”

The head of the Han family and the Sect Master of the Flying Heaven Sect both suffered losses. They used treasures to comfort the disciples who were involved in this karma.

This matter seemed to have ended, but there was trouble ahead.

Han Jue deduced that the karma between the two of them was already deep. There would definitely be a shocking battle between the two forces. This also involved Han Ye and Han Yao.

Especially Han Ye. The Flying Heaven Sect would be Han Ye’s stepping stone to attain the Dao.

Han Jue began to look forward to that day, but this karma would have already ended when he came out of seclusion the next time.

The father and daughter stood up and left for the Chaos.

Several decades later, they returned to the third Dao Field.

Han Jue directly moved Han Yao into the third Dao Field and created a clone to teach him. His main body began to enter seclusion.

Han Yao was handsome and suave. Since he looked like Han Jue, he attracted Xing Hongxuan and the other women’s attention.

At first, Han Yao panicked. After Han Jue’s explanation, the panic turned into surprise. He knelt down to the ancestor and began to enjoy the first opportunity of his life.

Han Ling was very interested in Han Yao. She wanted to see how powerful this descendant her father had made an exception to take in was. In the end, he was not outstanding.

The Conquest Heavenly Star required battles to grow. Only then could his potential and strength transform. The current Han Yao and Han Ye were the same. They had yet to show their potential.

After losing interest, Han Ling no longer paid attention to Han Yao.

Han Yao usually meditated and cultivated. Every time he broke through, Han Jue’s clone would teach him a Mystical Power and preach the Dao.

Even Xing Hongxuan could tell that Han Jue thought highly of Han Yao. Other than his own son, no one else had such treatment.

No, even his own son was inferior. Han Jue didn’t specially create clones to treat Han Huang and his children.

Ten thousand years later.

Han Yao was sent back to the Immortal World by Han Jue’s clone.

This time, a peerless prodigy had descended.

More than three hundred thousand years later.

Han Jue was still cultivating in seclusion when a notification appeared in front of him.

(The Evil Heavenly Emperor sent you a dream. Do you accept?]

It was very difficult for all living beings to visit him in his dreams after he became a Dao Creator. However, he gave special privileges to the people he cared about to prevent them from encountering danger.

Han Jue hesitated for a moment but still agreed to the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s request.

The dream was a small forest outside the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. The Evil Heavenly Emperor immediately said, “I have something to ask of

you…”

Han Jue retracted his divine light and asked with a smile, “What is it?” He couldn’t be bothered to calculate. After not seeing him for more than twenty million years, he really missed the Evil Heavenly Emperor.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor chuckled. “I won’t stand on ceremony with you. I want Han Yao and Han Ye. I really didn’t expect that other than your own children, the Han family would actually have such stunning descendants.

“Han Yao has already been chosen by the Heavenly Dao as the number one prodigy of the current generation. That Han Ye is even more impressive. He killed his way from the mortal world to the Immortal World and then to the Chaos. He’s like a god of slaughter. Leave him to me. It just so happens that he has the temperament to lead the righteous path.

“You’re busy cultivating and shouldn’t have time to care about them, right?”
