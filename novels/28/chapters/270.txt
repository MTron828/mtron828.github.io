Chapter 271 Immortal Slaying Sword Formation Completed!

The Demon Emperor was so ruthless?

Han Jue showed a frown.

Upon hearing Di Taibai’s words, his first reaction was to curse the Demon Emperor to death!

The Demon Emperor had a six-star hatred towards him. He wouldn’t rest until Han Jue was dead.

The Demon Court would definitely target him once the Heavenly Court was destroyed.

Yeah.

There was a need to make arrangements.

Han Jue was thinking for everyone.

After chatting with Di Taibai for a while, he put down the Heavenly Dao Token.

[You chose not to ascend for the time being and obtained a Supreme Treasure.] (Congratulations on obtaining the Nine Elements Ten Thousand Life Sword]

(Nine Elements Ten Thousand Life Sword: Emperor Dao Supreme Treasure, a Connate Sword condensed from the vitality of heaven and earth. Sword Qi is endless and inexhaustible. It is extremely powerful.]

Looking at the three lines of words in front of him, Han Jue smiled in satisfaction.

Now that he had the Primordial Judgment Sword, the God Slayer Sword, the Heaven and Earth Primordial Sword, and the Nine Elements Ten Thousand Life Sword, he should be able to use the Heavenly Sword Dao’s Immortal Slaying Sword Formation.

The Immortal Slaying Sword Formation formed by four powerful Dharma treasures would definitely have terrifying lethality. Han Jue thought silently. Recently, the cultivation of the Black Hell Chicken had advanced by leaps and bounds. It was probably related to the Black Hell Demon Lord.

Should he try to rope him in?

This fellow was from the Demon Court, after all. It wasn’t right for him to stay for so long.

Han Jue first successfully made the Nine Elements Ten Thousand Life Sword recognize him before starting the simulation trial.

Against the Black Hell Demon Lord!

With the fourth level of the Heavenly Sword Dao, the Immortal Slaying Sword Formation, Han Jue could finally kill him.

However, it required time to gather the sword formation. He couldn’t insta-kill the Black Hell Demon Lord.

This wasn’t good.

If he couldn’t kill him instantly, he couldn’t attack easily.

Han Jue started to worry.

Although the Immortal World was chaotic, the mortal world was temporarily unaffected.

Twenty years passed.

Han Jue’s cultivation improved greatly.

In the simulation trial, his speed at using the Immortal Slaying Sword Formation had also increased greatly. The time it took for him to kill the Black Hell Demon Lord had also decreased greatly.

He decided to confront him!

It was worth mentioning that the current Black Hell Demon Lord had already become a deacon of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.

At that moment, he was teaching the Black Hell Chicken cultivation in his cave abode.

“Let’s chat in the void.”

Han Jue’s voice floated into the Black Hell Demon Lord’s ears.

The Black Hell Demon Lord frowned slightly and thought, He finally can’t take it anymore?

He had always been wary of the mysterious cultivator from the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.

It was because he couldn’t capture Han Jue’s aura or see the true situation in the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain. What did that mean?

This meant that Han Jue was very likely stronger than him!

The Black Hell Demon Lord took a deep breath and stood up. “I’ll go out for a while.”

The Black Hell Chicken didn’t think too much and focused on cultivating.

In the void.

As the Black Hell Demon Lord appeared and looked at Han Jue, shock flashed across his eyes.

What a handsome man!

Even though he had been in the Immortal World for millions of years, he had never seen a man more handsome than Han Jue. His appearance and temperament would shock both men and women.

His enemies could hate him and detest him, but they would not find him ugly.

“What do you want?” Han Jue stared at him and asked.

For some reason, the Black Hell Demon Lord felt inexplicably uneasy being stared at by him.

He was a Rank Five Immortal Emperor!

The Black Hell Demon Lord said, “The chicken under you is related to me.” “What else?”

“The Demon Emperor asked me to avenge the Golden Roc Demon Lord.”

“Then, why aren’t you attacking?”

Han Jue didn’t expect the other party to be so honest.

The Black Hell Demon Lord said helplessly, “The calamity is coming. I don’t want to become enemies with a powerful expert, so I want to handle this perfunctorily.”

Han Jue narrowed his eyes and said, “How about joining my Hidden Sect? The Hidden Sect doesn’t want to enter the calamity. We can take care of each other.”

The Black Hell Demon Lord fell silent.

Han Jue stared at him, ready to attack at any time.

If this fellow refused and still wanted to stay here, Han Jue could only kill him.

He couldn’t leave any hidden danger around him.

The Black Hell Demon Lord frowned. “What can I obtain by joining the Hidden Sect?”

“Your enemy is my enemy.”

“It’s not enough to move me. Don’t worry, I’ll stay in the Jade Pure Sacred Sect and won’t harm anyone. I’ll leave when the Immeasurable Calamity is over.”

Han Jue smiled.

Wait for the Immeasurable Calamity to pass?

Damn it!

Do you think you’re funny? An Immeasurable Calamity might last for tens of thousands of years! Even if he paid rent, it would be a huge sum of money! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Han Jue asked, “What’s your relationship with the Black Hell Chicken?”

Upon mentioning the chicken, the Black Hell Demon Lord smiled helplessly and said, “That kid is…”

The Primordial Judgment Sword suddenly appeared in Han Jue’s hand, and he suddenly slashed with it.

Sword Pierces Heaven!

The Black Hell Demon Lord’s expression changed drastically. He subconsciously raised his hand to block, but he was still sent flying by the sword Qi.

Han Jue quickly took out the God Slayer Sword, Heaven and Earth Primordial Sword, and Nine Elements Ten Thousand Life Sword. The four swords flew up together and began to gather the Immortal Slaying Sword Formation.

The Black Hell Demon Lord stabilized himself and roared, “What do you want?”

Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to say more. He used his hand as a sword and used the Three Pure World Cleansing-Nine Heavens.

Nine Sword Qi seas quickly appeared, condensing into billions of sword shadows that charged at the other party.

The Black Hell Demon Lord took out a long saber that looked like a fang. He pointed his left hand at the blade, and a demonic aura surged into it.

As he waved his saber in all directions, the terrifying demonic aura transformed into countless demons and ghosts, roaring as they attacked the sword shadow torrent of Three Pure World Cleansing. The battle between the two Immortal Emperors was like a war between two races!

“As expected, he has ill intentions!”

Han Jue cursed silently. This fellow didn’t escape and chose to fight with him. It was obvious that he wanted to target him. (The Black Hell Demon Lord has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 3 stars]

Seeing a line of words appear in front of him, Han Jue’s interest soared.

He immediately cast the Great Traversal Divine Shadow nine times and joined the sword shadows to kill the other party.

The Black Hell Demon Lord tried his best to block, but Han Jue’s Dharmic powers were too powerful and boundless.

The Black Hell Demon Lord leaped, and thousand-foot-long black wings spread out from his back. Flames burned.

He raised his saber and black flames swept up, turning into a terrifying black rain that descended on Han Jue.

The sword shadows of the Three Pure World Cleansing were neutralized by the black rain, and Demonic Qi mist filled the vast void. At this moment, Han Jue’s Immortal Slaying Sword Formation was about to form.

The Black Hell Demon Lord also noticed the sword formation. He was secretly shocked.

“What formation is that?”

The Black Hell Demon Lord frowned and suddenly had the intention to retreat.

However, Han Jue’s sudden attack infuriated him.

He was a Rank Five Immortal Emperor, yet the other party didn’t give him face!

Try again!

The Black Hell Demon Lord made up his mind. He wanted to see how strong Han Jue was! Han Jue suddenly appeared behind him and waved his right hand, causing the Five Elements Divine Light to shoot out. The Black Hell Demon Lord instinctively brandished his saber to block, but with a brush of the Five Elements Divine Light, the saber brushed away. He didn’t even have time to react.

Impossible!

Shocked, the Black Hell Demon Lord immediately dodged. Then, countless black raindrops shot towards Han Jue.

At this moment!

Han Jue’s four swords suddenly pulled away. Terrifying killing intent filled the void and locked onto the Black Hell Demon Lord.

The Black Hell Demon Lord looked up in horror and shouted, “Immortal Slaying Sword Formation! How is that possible!”

Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

This guy is quite knowledgeable!

Then, you’ll die even more thoroughly! After the simulation trial, Han Jue knew that the Black Hell Demon Lord couldn’t withstand the Immortal Slaying Sword Formation at all!

He would definitely die!
