Chapter 963 A Million Great Dao Sages, Unparalleled Battle

A Great Dao Divine Spirit came in front of the Holy Mother of Order and sent a voice transmission, “Holy Mother, be careful. A traitor has appeared. Don’t summon too many.”

The Holy Mother of Order did not answer. She chatted with the mighty figures from the future. The Great Dao Divine Spirits couldn’t say much, afraid that it would affect morale. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yi Tian approached Han Tuo and sighed, “Looks like the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is still influential to his descendants. Does this mean that it’s very difficult to kill him this time?”

Han Tuo’s expression darkened.

!!

It was unknown what Han Huang was thinking.

Jiang Jueshi said, “Not necessarily. Perhaps he died. If the descendants want to hide this past, they will naturally beautify Master.”

Yi Tian felt that it made sense.

At the same time, figures were still emerging from the Chaotic Divine Authority. The weakest was a Great Dao Sage.

As more and more Great Dao Sages appeared, the experts from the future also realized that the enemy this time was very strong. So strong that even the combined forces of so many mighty figures were not enough. For a time, the void under the Chaotic Divine Authority fell silent.

The new future experts sensed the solemn atmosphere and did not dare to ask. They could only ask their past selves.

Soon, the number of Great Dao Sages here exceeded twenty thousand and was still increasing

Thirty thousand!

Forty thousand!

Fifty thousand!

The Great Dao Sages present were no longer excited. They only felt nervous inside.

How strong was an enemy that even fifty thousand Great Dao Sages could not defeat?

There would definitely be heavy casualties!

No one dared to disturb the Holy Mother of Order. They believed that she knew what to do.

The Holy Mother of Order did not stop, which meant that it was not enough.

Time passed.

The future Jiang Jueshi came to Jiang Jueshi’s side. The two of them communicated through voice transmission. Jiang Jueshi’s expression changed slightly.

Jiang Jueshi turned to look at the future Jiang Jueshi and discovered that his future self was a little different, but he couldn’t tell what was different.

Han Huang stared at the future Jiang Jueshi with an extremely cold gaze.

The future Jiang Jueshi smiled at him.

Yi Tian suddenly asked, “Why are you the only one in your future?”

Han Huang had three futures selves, and Han Tuo had more than ten.

Jiang Jueshi was stunned and did not know what to say.

The future Jiang Jueshi smiled and said, “He has many future selves, but they are all isolated by me.”

Isolated?

Han Tuo, Han Huang, Yi Tian, and the other Divine Punishers standing nearby were all stunned.

What kind of method was this?

The future Jiang Jueshi smiled and said, “Alright, let’s wait and see. There will be a good show next.”

Yi Tian stared at him and asked in a low voice, “Are you also a traitor?”

The future Jiang Jueshi shook his head and laughed.

Jiang Jueshi frowned and fell into deep thought.

In the Grand Primordium Domain.

Han Jue’s clone was still waiting.

“The Holy Mother of Order is really patient,” Han Jue muttered to himself. There were already more than a hundred thousand Great Dao Sages. There were already thousands of Great Dao Supremes among them. The Holy Mother of Order was still summoning.

Sigh!

Something was wrong.

If it was a novel that Han Jue had read in his previous life, the enemy would only face destruction if they underestimated the protagonist. Counting Han Jue’s past enemies, every one of them had a backup plan and never underestimated him. It was just that they didn’t overestimate him enough.

The reason why they didn’t overestimate him was that he kept a low profile.

Han Jue wasn’t in a hurry.

In any case, he had already deduced the outcome of this battle in advance. It was safe.

In the third Dao Field.

Han Jue began the simulation trial. The target was the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. He had secretly copied the data when he fought the other party previously.

Several days later.

Han Jue was very confident.

Holy Mother of Order, continue summoning!

I’ll look down on you if you summon less than a million!

Ten years later.

The Chaotic Divine Authority finally left. The Holy Mother of Order turned to look at the countless mighty figures around her. Their auras became vast as they gathered together.

The Holy Mother of Order said, “Everyone, we are about to face an unprecedented enemy. He is too powerful and can be considered the number one since ancient times. However, I don’t know if he will be counted in the future. I don’t want anything to happen to you, so gather enough forces and suppress him forcefully!

“No, it’s enough to suppress any powerful enemy!”

Her words were very soft, but the hearts of more than a million Great Dao Sages surged with blood.

Looking up, such a grand occasion would almost never happen again!

“Great Dao Divine Spirit, lead the way to the Grand Primordium Domain. Kill the Divine Might Heavenly Sage and eliminate evil for the Chaos in the future!”

The Holy Mother of Order waved her hand. With that said, the million Great Dao Sages erupted with a terrifying aura. Led by the current Great Dao Divine Spirit, they flew towards the Grand Primordium Domain.

“Divine Might Heavenly Sage, I didn’t expect to really face this legend today.”

“There are also legends of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage in my era. It’s said he’s invincible.”

“It’s fine. With so many mighty figures joining forces, not to mention one Divine Might Heavenly Sage, even a hundred will die!”

“Hahaha, this battle will definitely rewrite history!”

“Perhaps this is history, but we just didn’t know.”

How terrifying was the aura of a million Great Dao Sages? It shocked the entire Chaos.

More and more cultivators rushed to the Grand Primordium Domain. Their cultivation levels were at least that of a Freedom Sage. No matter how low their cultivation levels were, they did not dare to go. Even if they hated the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, they would not blindly die.

How fast were they? With the help of so many Great Dao Supremes, they arrived in front of the Grand Primordium Domain in less than five minutes and surrounded it.

Han Jue slowly stood up. Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols appeared above his head. All of them were majestic and gathered together. Even the Grand Primordium Domain couldn’t contain them.

Han Jue looked up and saw many familiar faces.

His two sons were here, as well as his disciple.

It was worth mentioning that Dao Sovereign and the other two were gone. These three were clearly Great Dao Sages and hated him, but they had never come to seek revenge.

They were probably being beaten somewhere.

To trap a Great Dao Sage and beat him, it had to be a dangerous place.

Han Jue was just thinking casually. His attention was still on the scene in front of him.

“Divine Might Heavenly Sage, surrender!” a Great Dao Divine Spirit shouted angrily. The killing intent of a million Great Dao Sages erupted and locked onto Han Jue.

The void instantly shattered like a mirror, leaving only the Primordial Void.

The Grand Primordium Domain also shattered!

A peerless battle was about to break out!

Han Jue looked at the million Great Dao Sages and thought to himself, “I wanted you to summon a million, but you really did it!”

It had to be said that the Holy Mother of Order was still very capable.

Unfortunately, it was not enough! “There’s no point in saying anything. Come and die!” Han Jue said domineeringly. The three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols were successfully condensed. They stood behind Han Jue with their backs facing each other and roared in all directions, shaking the entire Primordial Void.

“Kill!”

A Great Dao Supreme in golden armor was the first to attack. He held a halberd that emitted a divine light and attacked Han Jue. The moment he moved, tens of thousands of mighty figures immediately followed.

Hundreds of thousands of Great Dao Sages used their Mystical Powers together. They first sealed this void to prevent Han Jue from escaping

All sorts of domineering and exquisite Mystical Powers attacked Han Jue. In an instant, he saw countless illusions, as if ten thousand reincarnations had passed.

Petty trick!

Han Jue’s red eyes lit up and directly dispersed countless illusion Mystical Powers.
