Chapter 244 Severely Injured Jiang Yi, Difference Between Immortal and Mortal

After returning to the cave abode, Han Jue immediately entered the simulation trial and fought the current Jiang Yi. He was insta-killed.

Han Jue was disappointed.

Is this an Immortal Emperor?

Amazing!

Murong Qi had fought so many Immortal Emperors alone. He was truly impressive.

Han Jue perked up and continued to comprehend the Great Dao of Life and Death.

He would use Jiang Yi as a standard in the future.

Now that Han Jue had a goal, his fighting spirit was ignited and he became more energetic in his cultivation.

Numinous Palace.

The Heavenly Emperor sat on the Emperor’s throne and instructed, “Divine General, go teach Jiang Yi a lesson. Treat it as a spar.”

The Divine General immediately accepted the order and left.

The Heavenly Emperor looked at the other person in the hall.

The Crown Prince of the Heavenly Court.

Long Jun!

“Between you and Jiang Yi, who is more talented?” the Heavenly Emperor asked.

Long Jun said expressionlessly, “We’re on par. I became an Emperor earlier than him. He’s not my match for the time being.” The Heavenly Emperor smiled in satisfaction.

As expected of the son he valued the most!

Long Jun asked curiously, “Father, where did Han Jue come from? The story he told was clearly about the Magus-Demon Calamity, but he changed the character names.”

The Heavenly Emperor smiled. “I can’t tell you his background, but one thing is certain. His only backing now is the Heavenly Court.”

Long Jun was deep in thought.

He continued, “I heard that Profound Truth Divine Emperor has entered the Heavenly Court. Can you hand him to me? I’ll help him quickly recover his cultivation from his previous life.”

At the mention of Profound Truth Divine Emperor, a strange light flashed in his eyes.

“Don’t disturb him for the time being. He’s in seclusion,” the Heavenly Emperor said casually.

Long Jun looked regretful.

The Heavenly Emperor smiled without saying anything Profound Truth Divine Emperor was truly a good signboard!

Previously, Long Jun rarely returned to the Heavenly Court. Now, it was obvious that he was coming back for the Profound Truth Divine Emperor. “Divine Palace, I will devour you soon!”

The Heavenly Emperor’s eyes flickered with ambition.

In the blink of an eye.

Fifty years passed.

Han Jue’s cultivation level kept increasing steadily.

Today, he challenged Jiang Yi and was finally not insta-killed.

He could withstand three moves!

Don’t underestimate these three moves. There were no emotions in the simulation trial. They fought at full strength.

He had to face Jiang Yi with all his might!

Han Jue was very satisfied with his progress.

Perhaps when he reached a point where he could no longer strengthen himself, he would become an Immortal Emperor! How talented was Jiang Yi? If Han Jue could fight Jiang Yi at the Golden Immortal Realm, he would be the strongest Immortal Emperor no matter how he stepped into the Immortal Emperor Realm!

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started to celebrate.

He checked his emails, wondering how his friends were doing.

(Your disciple Su Qi was abducted by a mysterious mighty figure.] (Your good friend Ji Xianshen has become a Ghost Deity. His cultivation has increased greatly.)

(Your grand-disciple Murong Qi was attacked by Heavenly Troops] x190421

(Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has comprehended the Heavenly Dao and a cultivation technique.)

(Your good friend Jiang Yi was attacked by your good friend Divine General. He was severely injured.)

[Your enemy Nine-tailed Demon Empress has lost 100,000 years of lifespan because of your curse. She has developed a mental demon.]

(Your good friend Sword God Emperor was attacked by a True Devil] x49

Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

Jiang Yi was injured by the Divine General?

Could it be that the Heavenly Emperor was helping him?

Han Jue’s favorability with the Heavenly Emperor increased. His current favorability was five stars.

He continued reading. Most of his friends were fine. They were doing well.

He checked his interpersonal relationships and discovered that there were fewer portraits. They were from some low-level immortals from the Jade Pure Sacred Sect and the Heavenly Court.

There were always deaths on the path of cultivation.

Han Jue was a little melancholic, but not sad. The ones he paid special attention to were still alive.

It was worth mentioning that Yang Tiandong’s portrait was long gone.

After reincarnation, without the memories of his previous life, his favorable impression of Han Jue naturally disappeared.

However, Han Jue could sense the Six Paths Insignia in his soul.

Under Meng Po’s arrangements, Yang Tiandong reincarnated in the Reroll World and was born in the Heavenly Immortal Manor…

The top potential in the mortal world was really not worth mentioning.

Meng Po waved her hand, and Yang Tiandong became a prodigy in the mortal world. This was also why most ascenders became mediocre after entering the Immortal World.

The geniuses of the mortal world and the geniuses of the Immortal World were worlds apart.

Several months later, Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune.

He came to the Nine Heavens Galaxy Water. Ever since Li Yao came to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain, the Nine Heavens Galaxy Water no longer reflected her.

Han Jue began to look forward to it reflecting the next Son of Heaven and Earth.

“Master, I’ve mastered the second level of the Heavenly Sword Dao. Can you teach me the third level?” Dao Comprehension Sword suddenly asked with anticipation.

Han Jue glanced at her. Her current realm had already reached the Mahayana Realm, and she was only a step away from becoming a Loose Immortal.

“You can become a Loose Immortal first,” Han Jue said in a low voice.

Dao Comprehension Sword nodded.

Currently, the weakest person in the Hidden Sect was at the Mahayana Realm, including Zhou Mingyue and the Black Hell Chicken.

The reason why Dao Comprehension Sword’s cultivation level was slow was that she was cultivating the Heavenly Sword Dao.

It was all thanks to the Spirit Qi on the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain that she could cultivate so quickly. It far exceeded any place in the world.

If Ji Xianshen was born on the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain, he would probably ascend to the perfected Mahayana Realm in less than five hundred years.

Chu Shiren often skived and kept his cultivation level above Zhou Mingyue’s. This made Zhou Mingyue very depressed. He always almost surpassed his master.

The Eight Calabash Brothers had already begun to break through to the Earth Immortal Realm.

The strongest was still Li Yao, followed by Long Hao, who was at the mid-stage Grand Unity Heaven Immortal Realm.

Han Jue was very satisfied with their cultivation speed.

He returned to the bed to cultivate.

On this day, Daoist Nine Cauldrons came to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain and wanted to visit Han Jue, but he was stopped.

“Sect Master, you can tell us if you have anything to say,” Xun Chang’an said.

Daoist Nine Cauldrons was secretly shocked.

What cultivation level was this kid at now? Why couldn’t he see through it? “The Jade Pure Sacred Sect is about to hold a Dao Exchange Meeting, and we plan to invite the cultivation world of the ten states and nine dynasties to participate. I wonder if Elder Han can participate?” Daoist Nine Cauldrons asked shamelessly.

Xun Chang’an shook his head, causing Daoist Nine Cauldrons’ heart to skip a beat. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Xun Chang’an said meaningfully, “Sect Master, from now on, don’t think about my master anymore. If the Jade Pure Sacred Sect is in trouble, we will help. Master won’t make a move anymore. There are differences between mortals and immortals.” His words almost suffocated Daoist Nine Cauldrons.

He had guessed this before, so he didn’t dare to disturb Han Jue.

This time, the sect had begged him to come, so he had come under pressure.

“That’s right. In the eyes of my master, all living beings in the mortal world are equal. Don’t fawn on him in the future!” The Black Hell Chicken smiled smugly.

Daoist Nine Cauldrons was embarrassed and troubled.

Xun Chang’an looked at Zhou Mingyue and said, “Mingyue, represent our Hidden Sect to attend the Dao Meeting.”

Zhou Mingyue frowned, but he didn’t dare to refuse. After all, Xun Chang’an was a senior.

Hidden Sect?

Daoist Nine Cauldrons caught this name. Elder Han had established his own sect?

Daoist Nine Cauldrons felt uncomfortable. But on second thought, Elder Han was already extraordinary, and the Hidden Sect wouldn’t be a mortal sect.

His emotions became complicated.

In the end, it turned into a sigh.

He was suddenly confused.

If he cultivated diligently like Han Jue, would he have also surpassed mortals now?
