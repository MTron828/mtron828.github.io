Chapter 223 Divine Lord Wu De, Murong Qi’s Ascension

After knowing the truth, Han Jue hurriedly used the Heavenly Dao Token to contact Di Taibai.

Soon, the divine sense connection was successful.

“What’s going on? Why did someone from the Heavenly Court deliberately increase the providence of our Scarlet Cloud World?” Han Jue asked.

He was really angry.

Di Taibai was speechless.

Isn’t it good to help you?

Di Taibai said, “The stronger the Scarlet Cloud World is, the greater the benefits to you. The stronger your providence is, the less likely you will encounter mental demons. In addition, your disciples and grand-disciples can always accompany you. Isn’t that a good thing?”

Han Jue said, “I’m afraid of trouble. The stronger the Scarlet Cloud World is, the more enemies there will be.”

“That’s true. So, you have to let your disciples become stronger quickly. You can recommend them to the Heavenly Court in the future.”

“Good fellow, that’s your plan all along?”

“Don’t mind it too much. If you want to become an Immortal Emperor, you need providence. No matter what cultivation technique it is, it’s the same. You will soon understand that if you don’t fight with others, you need a Deity Position.”

“Really?”

“Would I lie to you?”

Han Jue remained silent.

He didn’t give up. “Then, you have to send experts to guard the void of the Scarlet Cloud World. Otherwise, I’m afraid of death.”

“How many people can actually kill you now?” Di Taibai said helplessly.

After knowing that Han Jue was a Golden Immortal, he knew that he might not be hi’s match anymore.

The Heavenly Court was interested in Han Jue because of his combat strength.

He could fight above his realm!

Han Jue said, “I can be at ease with just one more person.”

“Alright, I’ll ask His Majesty.”

“How’s the Heavenly Emperor recently?”

“He just suppressed an Immortal Emperor not long ago. You don’t have to worry about His Majesty. The strongest person in the Heavenly Court is His Majesty.”

“Then, I’m relieved.”

After severing the connection with his divine sense, Han Jue clicked his tongue in wonder.

He didn’t expect the Heavenly Emperor to be the strongest in the Heavenly Court.

Could it be that the Heavenly Emperor position was snatched by brute force?

When he surpassed the Heavenly Emperor, could he also become a Heavenly Emperor?

Forget it!

Too troublesome!

Besides, the Heavenly Emperor had done him a favor. He couldn’t stab him in the back.

Han Jue no longer cared about the mortal world and continued cultivating.

In the following period of time, the Spirit Qi in the entire mortal world increased, causing an uproar.

The Jade Pure Sacred Sect was also very surprised. The cultivators thought that it was the Deity Slaying Elder’s doing.

On the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain, Chu Shiren was stimulated by something and began to cultivate diligently. His breakthrough speed also stimulated the others.

Zhou Mingyue finally began to show his talent.

Forty years passed. Han Jue finally broke through to the mid-stage of the Reincarnation Golden Immortal Realm and almost cried in joy.

After breaking through, he hurriedly raised his Mystical Powers.

Three years later, his strength had increased to its current limit.

Han Jue started the simulation trial and fought Jiang Yi. Five minutes later.

He opened his eyes and frowned slightly.

Killing Jiang Yi took so long. This fellow was really ridiculously strong!

After so many years, Jiang Yi’s strength was definitely stronger than in the simulation trial.

“Sigh, there’s always someone stronger. I still have to hurry up and cultivate.”

Han Jue thought silently and felt a sense of urgency.

He couldn’t let Jiang Yi win!

He had to have the strength to kill Jiang Yi the next time they met!

Han Jue’s eyes were firm.

“Master, Li Yao left her mortal world, but she’s lost. Should we guide her?” Dao Comprehension Sword asked when she saw Han Jue open his eyes.

In the long years, watching Li Yao’s life was already her greatest interest.

When Li Yao was injured, her heart would ache. When Li Yao fought her way out, she would be pleasantly surprised.

Han Jue was glad that she wasn’t in the modern world of Earth. Otherwise, she would definitely be useless and would stay at home to watch dramas every day.

“It’s fine. You only know how precious life is after experiencing countless dangers,” Han Jue replied. With Li Yao’s cautious personality, it was very difficult for her to die on the way. Dao Comprehension Sword sighed. “I hope she can persist.”

After observing Li Yao for so long, Dao Comprehension Sword quite liked her. It was mainly because Li Yao didn’t take the initiative to provoke others and did not cry. She always appeared very strong.

Han Jue walked to the Nine Heavens Galaxy Water, took out the Book of Misfortune, and started cursing the enemies. Li Yao was still the same as before even after so many years had passed. She was dressed in white, as white as snow. As she walked in the void, she was elegant and mysterious, as if she was a god that walked in the chaos and had no destination.

The only change was that her gaze became more determined.

Several months later, Han Jue’s curse ended. He checked his emails and didn’t see any enemy injured by his curse.

Damn!

Han Jue continued cultivating, striving to reach the late-stage of the Reincarnation Golden Immortal Realm as soon as possible.

Ten years later.

Han Jue opened his eyes and prepared to relax. He habitually tested the strongest person in the Scarlet Cloud World.

[Divine Lord Wu De: Perfected Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm, third-grade Heavenly General of the Heavenly Court]

The expert of the Heavenly Court had arrived!

Han Jue smiled.

The Heavenly Emperor was still reliable.

Han Jue immediately simulated the trial.

There was no insta-kill!

Divine Lord Wu De lasted for ten seconds!

Not bad! Not bad!

Han Jue was very satisfied with Divine Lord Wu De’s strength. After all, he could instantly kill Di Taibai and Dragon Subduing Buddha.

With Divine Lord Wu De around, Han Jue would be more at ease cultivating.

“Master, Murong Qi is looking for you. He wants to ascend.”

Dao Comprehension Sword saw that his eyes had opened and immediately said.

Han Jue raised his eyebrows. “Let him in,” Han Jue muttered.

Dao Comprehension Sword nodded and went out to call Murong Qi in.

Murong Qi entered and knelt in front of him. “Grandmaster, can you let me enter the Heavenly Court? I cultivate the Dao of Battle. I can only become stronger quickly in battle.” Han Jue said, “No problem, but you have to be careful. Always be vigilant when outside. The Divine Palace has already discovered you.”

Murong Qi nodded. He had thought about many things and about all the possible dangers.

Han Jue took out the Heavenly Dao Token and contacted Di Taibai in front of Murong Qi.

“I have a grand-disciple who wants to enter the Heavenly Court. He wants to fight. Can you help me arrange it?” Han Jue asked.

Di Taibai smiled. “No problem. Is it Murong Qi?”

“Looks like you’ve been thinking about it for a long time.”

“We’ve long heard of the Divine Palace’s Profound Truth Divine Emperor. When the time comes, I’ll try my best to let him avoid the Divine Palace and fight with the Demon Court first.”

“Alright!”

Han Jue cut off the connection and looked at Murong Qi. “It’s settled.”

Could it be that the Heavenly Emperor, an old fox, had figured out all the disciples of the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain?

Even the reincarnation of Profound Truth Divine Emperor was exposed.

Murong Qi asked curiously, “Grandmaster, what’s your relationship with the Heavenly Court?”

This wasn’t like a mortal world guardian at all. Murong Qi felt that Han Jue might be a second-grade immortal or even higher.

Han Jue smiled and said, “Anyway, the Heavenly Court treats me well. You can stay there in peace.”

The Heavenly Court had already offended many experts for him. At this point, Han Jue already trusted the Heavenly Emperor.

Murong Qi nodded and said, “Grandmaster, I’ve left a cave abode in the Upper World. When I find it, I’ll send some treasures back to help the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain increase its Spirit Qi. I also have a group of subordinates who can also guard the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.”

Subordinates?

Han Jue asked, “How strong are they?”

“There are a total of 72 Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm cultivators.”

Murong Qi’s answer caused Han Jue to raise his eyebrows.

So many?

There were as many Golden Immortals as dogs?
