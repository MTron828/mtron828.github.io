Chapter 714 Terror of the Emperor

After Xuan Qingjun finished speaking, Han Jue said, “Actually, you don’t have to report to me. I know everything.”

The five women were stunned and couldn’t help but revere his cultivation.

The Holy Mother Sect was so far away from the Hundred Peak Immortal River, but Han Jue could actually see everything.

“Since you’re finally back, I’ll preach to you,” he muttered. The five women looked happy and nodded.

The Great Dao of Extreme Origin covered the Daoist temple.

Fifty years later. Han Jue ended the lecture and let them rest first.

Li Yao stayed behind. The other four women pretended not to see this and left.

She looked up at him and said, “I want to pass the position of the Sect Master to Ling’er. I want to come back and cultivate. Can you help me become stronger? I don’t want to stop in the Heavenly Dao.”

Han Jue asked, “Why did your ancestor send you a dream?”

Li Yao was stunned for a moment before saying, “He taught me cultivation. He hopes that after I become stronger, I can go to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End to help him.

“You can see him visiting me in my dreams? Aren’t you stronger than him?”

At that time, she had cautiously asked Li Zizai. Li Zizai was full of confidence and said that no one would discover.

Han Jue said, “Of course. Li Zizai is only a Freedom Sage. How can he compare to me?”

He deliberately said that with the intention of intimidating her.

Although Li Yao’s favorability was still six stars, everyone had their own ambitions. He did not want her to go against him.

Li Yao said, “You’re really powerful. This is also why I want to come back. I don’t want to be too close to my ancestor. I, Li Yao, didn’t rely on my ancestor’s bloodline to be where I am today. It’s all due to you.”

Back then, the family married her off for benefits. She resisted and was hunted down. When she was in despair, Han Jue helped.

If not for him, even if she didn’t resist, she would probably have died in the previous calamity.

Han Jue smiled. “I thought you were going to run away with your ancestor.”

Li Yao shook her head. “Impossible. His Dao technique is average. He might be hiding something from me. I wonder how many disciples of the Li family are like me.”

She looked at Han Jue again and said seriously, “I feel that I’ve already reached a bottleneck. Is there a way to attain the Dao? But I don’t want to become a Heavenly Dao Sage. I want to walk your path.”

Pseudo-Sage was already the ceiling for 99% of the geniuses. They couldn’t take another step forward all their lives.

Han Jue said meaningfully, “Indeed, but it will be very painful. Moreover, I have to guarantee that you are completely loyal to me and will never betray me.”

Li Yao’s eyes lit up. “I’m not afraid of pain. As for loyalty, I’m already yours. How can I betray you?”

The way she said that…

Han Jue said seriously, “In the future, when Li Zizai visits you in your dreams, you can pretend to communicate with him and find out his goal, but you can’t harm any disciple of the Hidden Sect, understand?”

Li Yao nodded.

She leaned forward and began to strip.

Han Jue frowned. “What are you doing? I’m not threatening you.”

Li Yao said, “I just want to try the cultivation technique I obtained previously. I wonder how wonderful it is to cultivate with a mighty figure like you.”

Hearing this, Han Jue’s brows relaxed.

He did not like to force others, but it was fine if the other party took the initiative.

It was good to relax occasionally.

What happened after that was not for mortals to see.

In the blink of an eye, half a year passed.

After Li Yao and Han Jue fought for two months, Xuan Qingjun came next and fought for another four months.

During this period, Xuan Qingjun also wanted to give birth to a child for Han Jue, but he rejected her.

Xing Hongxuan’s son was not even born yet. He couldn’t create another problem now.

He would think about it in the future.

Xuan Qingjun also knew Xing Hongxuan’s situation and did not insist.

Before Han Jue cultivated, he sent Li Yao and Xuan Qingjun out. They planned to return to cultivate, but before that, they still had to deal with the aftermath and find a good successor for the Holy Mother Sect.

They would return in another five thousand years.

Han Jue closed his eyes and started cultivating again.

On the other side.

Outside the 33rd Heaven.

Pan Xin, Jin Shen, and Emperor Xiao gathered in the hall.

Pan Xin and Jin Shen were both exhausted.

Emperor Xiao stared at Pan Xin and hesitated.

He wanted to tell him about Han Jue’s strength, but he was afraid of hurting him. If Pan Xin was not convinced and directly challenged Han Jue, it would definitely be a disaster for the Heavenly Dao.

Emperor Xiao had his own vision. He could fight for power, but he had to ensure that the Heavenly Dao was not implicated.

Pan Xin said, “The situation in the Chaos has suddenly changed. Recently, a large faction has appeared and swept through the Chaos. The Chaotic Heavenly Road is also threatened. This matter is not optimistic. Fellow Daoist Xiao, can you gather the devils to guard it?”

The Devil Race had always existed, but they did not appear in the Heavenly Dao collectively.

Emperor Xiao frowned. “The devils under me don’t have a Sage. How can they have the strength to guard it?”

Pan Xin waved his hand. “Make the arrangements first. I’ll discuss with the other Sages.”

With that, he stood up and left, not giving Emperor Xiao a chance to refuse.

After Pan Xin headed to the Universal Hall, Emperor Xiao couldn’t help but tell Jin Shen about Han Jue’s performance.

After Jin Shen learned of this, his expression changed drastically, but he did not panic.

He already knew Pan Xin’s attitude towards Han Jue.

In any case, they would not become enemies. What was there to panic about?

Jin Shen said earnestly, “Regarding Han Jue, we shouldn’t guess from the perspective of a competitor. This is also Fellow Daoist Pan’s intention.”

Emperor Xiao was moved.

Could it be that Pan Xin had also changed sides?

This situation was too familiar!

Previously, Qiu Xilai, Sect Master Tian Jue, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, and the other Sages had said the same. Then, every time Han Jue interfered with the Heavenly Dao’s decision, they agreed without any complaints.

Emperor Xiao’s face paled.

He suddenly felt that he was the only one in the entire Sage circle who did not worship Han Jue.

How could Han Jue be as simple as he seemed? The development of the Hidden Sect was completely ambitious!

Jin Shen saw the change in Emperor Xiao’s expression and could roughly guess what he was thinking, but he did not comfort him. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

To Jin Shen, he had no choice but to join Pan Xin. He had no objections to whoever Pan Xin followed.

In any case, the other Sages had also abandoned him.

In the entire Sage circle, only Han Jue’s faction had never suppressed him.

The Pangu Hall fell silent. The two Sages were each thinking about their own matters.

In the darkness, a white jade stone staircase stretched across the void. Han Tuo followed the Evil Heavenly Emperor.

Han Tuo wore silver armor and looked the same as before. The previous two vertical eyes on his forehead were nowhere to be seen.

“Your Majesty, who are we going to see?” Han Tuo asked curiously. He had already become a Sage. His senses had transformed. The Chaos had become especially vivid in his eyes. Everything was so new.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “To visit a senior of mine. It’s all thanks to him that I was able to establish the Heavenly Court.”

Han Tuo asked curiously, “Is it the previous one?!

The Evil Heavenly Emperor shook his head. “Don’t think about that person from before. He has long transcended the battle of the Chaos. The senior we’re meeting now is also a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.”
