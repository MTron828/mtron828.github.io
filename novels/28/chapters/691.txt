Chapter 693 True Sage Circle

“The faction chosen can choose the Son of Calamity?” Pan Xin asked curiously.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head. “There’s no limit to the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity for the time being. If we specify the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity, how will we weigh it? It will be troublesome. Why don’t we give all living beings a chance? The times will create heroes. There’s no need to be monopolized by the Sage Sects like in the past.” The Sages nodded.

There were already many Sages now. If it really came down to it, some Sages would always fall behind. Just thinking about it was painful. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du reminded, “At that time, the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity will be born. You can recruit him, but you can’t force him or threaten him. This is for the good of the Heavenly Dao. Once a Sage schemes, it will definitely destroy the balance. “We’ve planned for so long. We should work hard for cultivation. In the future, the Heavenly Dao Sages will definitely not be top-notch existences of the Heavenly Dao. We have to continue climbing and forever walk in front of all living beings.”

The Sages nodded.

Han Jue didn’t interrupt, but he still agreed with Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.

Internal strife would consume their strength. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du did not say anything more about the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity. He didn’t know who could stand out and kill his way out.

The Sages began to discuss which providence sect would accept the Son of Immeasurable Calamity. This might not be a good thing. Once a providence sect had a Son of the Immeasurable Calamity, they would easily become everyone’s target. Although the Immeasurable Calamity would not be as ferocious as before, the Sages did not want the sect they supported to decline. After arguing for a long time, the Sages changed the providence sect to a race. They felt that choosing the providence sect was still prone to conflict.

In the end, the Sages chose to vote.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I choose the Heavenly Race.” Shi Dudao raised his hand in agreement. Pan Xin followed, “I choose the Famous Race.”

It seemed that he was already in control of the Famous Race.

Emperor Xiao and Jin Shen raised their hands in agreement.

The remaining Sages looked at each other.

Han Jue said, “The Human Race.”

Li Daokong, Fang Liang, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Sect Master Tian Jue, Qiu Xilai, and Huang Zuntian raised their hands in agreement. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate glanced at Sect Master Tian Jue and still chose to raise his hand.

Updates by

The outcome was obvious.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was calm.

Pan Xin looked at Han Jue in surprise. Han Jue didn’t interrupt the previous discussion, He thought that he didn’t want to interfere, but he didn’t expect this fellow to directly make a choice.

Most importantly, most of the Sages chose to agree with him. He had always thought that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had the greatest say in the circle of Sages. Now, it seemed that this was not the case.

“This kid…”

Pan Xin had no choice but to size Han Jue up again.

Han Jue used the system to hide his cultivation level at the Heavenly Dao Sage level, but Pan Xin had heard that this fellow was already a Freedom Sage.

Han Jue ignored Pan Xin’s gaze. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du also decided that the Son of Calamity would appear in the Human Race.

As for whether it was born or reincarnated, that would depend on the providence of the Heavenly Dao. After the discussion, Han Jue stood up and left.

“Little Friend Han, shall we have a chat?” Pan Xin came over and chuckled.

Little friend?

Han Jue smiled. Even Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had to call him Fellow Daoist Han. Pan Xin still wanted to take advantage of him.

Qiu Xilai smiled. “Fellow Daoist Pan, watch your words. We’re all Sages. We have to be on the same level. If word gets out, won’t we be a joke?”

Sect Master Tian Jue, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Li Daokong, and the others agreed. Pan Xin’s smile froze. He had only said it unintentionally. He didn’t expect to be surrounded.

Huang Zuntian and Jin Shen understood.

The center of the so-called Sage circle was the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect. As for Pan Xin, he had yet to truly integrate into the Sage circle.

Han Jue said, “Fellow Daoist Pan, I have no intention of participating in the affairs of the Heavenly Dao. If you have something to say, discuss it with the other Sages.” With that, he returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Sitting on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus again, Han Jue was secretly pleased. It felt quite good to do one thing in front of others and secretly plot behind their backs.

No wonder the Sages were so sanctimonious.

As for Pan Xin’s thoughts, Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to consider them. Pan Xin had already changed greatly. Sooner or later, he would return to his original state and return to his usual cowardly self to begin seclusion cultivation. He really couldn’t scheme against the Sages. Previously, in the Universal Hall, Han Jue had been observing Huang Zuntian and discovered that he didn’t seem to be affected by the Primordial Origin. Primordial Origin’s coffin was still in the | dark void outside the netherworld. The Primordial Chaos Tablet also stood still. Other than him, no one realized that Primordial Origin had already fused with Huang Zuntian. Han Jue didn’t think too much and continued to comprehend the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.

Ever since the Sages confirmed that the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity would appear in the Human Race, the providence of the Human Race had also begun to rise. The various Sage Sects were deliberately supporting the Human Race. The footsteps of the Human Race began to expand. The entire Immortal World was built with human cities. At this rate, the Human Race would reach an unprecedented peak. At the same time, the Chaotic Heavenly Road also began to be recognized by all living beings. Cultivators kept returning, and all sorts of knowledge about the Chaos began to spread.

There was still a threshold to the Chaotic Heavenly Road.

Only Immortal Emperors could enter.

It couldn’t be helped. Creatures below the Emperor Realm couldn’t survive in the Dark Forbidden Zone.

Year after year passed. The Human Race dynasties appeared one after another. The Human Emperor cultivated in seclusion all day and conferred power to the Human Race, causing more and more kings and emperors to appear. Where there were people, there were battles.

There were always some ambitious people who ignored the peace that the Sages had painstakingly managed. When the various dynasties continued to expand their territory and bordered the other dynasties, war would inevitably erupt.

Han Jue didn’t know all of this. Even if he knew, he wouldn’t care. When the five thousand years were up, Han Jue slowly opened his eyes. He could feel that he was getting closer and closer to the Great Dao Realm.

He looked forward to the Great Dao Realm even more.

In a good mood, he began to check his emails.

In the depths of the chaos. A woman in a white dress emitting a dazzling light walked forward. Her face was beautiful and holy. A snake tail could be seen under her dress.

It was Nüwa.

Nüwa held a jade bottle and flew all the way, sprinkling Seven-Colored Divine Water from it.

Countless meteors floated in this domain. When the meteors were irrigated by the Seven-Colored Divine Water, they quickly turned into a continent. Countless flowers and plants sprouted. The entire process was extremely magical. After an unknown period of time, Nüwa landed on a stone platform. In the center of the platform stood a man. It was Fuxitian.

Fuxitian smiled. “Is there a need to be so anxious?”

Nüwa shook her head and said helplessly, “Time waits for no one. We don’t know what’s hidden in the Ancient Desolate at all. I have a feeling that the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity isn’t from the Primordial Fiendcelestial, but the Ancient Desolate.”

Fuxitian frowned. “You mean that Teacher lied to us?”

Nüwa did not reply.

Fuxitian frowned even more.

Nüwa changed the topic. “Recently, someone has been trying to break through to the Great Dao Realm. Guess who it is?”, Fuxitian pondered and said, “There aren’t many cultivators who can reach this level. The most likely one should be Divine Lord Peacock. It’s said that he has been chasing a mysterious Chaotic Fiendcelestial recently.” Nüwa shook her head. “No, it’s Han Jue.”,
