Chapter 217 Reincarnation Golden Immortal Realm!

“What’s wrong? The Heavenly Court is about to collapse?” Han Jue asked nervously. Just because he killed the son of the Demon Emperor? Di Taibai said, “How is that possible!”

Han Jue waited for him to continue.

However, he suddenly fell silent.

Han Jue frowned.

What was wrong with Di Taibai?

Did he disconnect?

The Heavenly Court’s network is so poor?

After a long while, Di Taibai sighed again and said, “I don’t know why, but the Divine Palace actually started a war with the Golden Crow Divine Clan. The Demon Court and the Buddhist Sect have formed an alliance again. The Heavenly Court is going to be in a passive state. In the following period of time, the Heavenly Court will be in a tough spot. But it’s fine. This is not the first time this has happened.”

Han Jue couldn’t help but mourn for them.

They had finally allied with the Divine Palace, but they had actually provoked the Golden Crow Divine Clan.

Perhaps it was related to the Demon Court.

But no matter what, Han Jue couldn’t care less.

“The Demon Emperor won’t find trouble with me, right?” Han Jue asked.

Di Taibai said, “The Demon Emperor has many sons. Crown Prince Tianze is not outstanding. The Demon Emperor is quite annoyed with him, in fact. He won’t act recklessly. The Demon Court and the Buddhist Sect can’t trust each other forever. As long as you don’t leave the Scarlet Cloud World or the Heavenly Court’s territory, that’s fine.”

Han Jue couldn’t help but ridicule, “It’s only been a few hundred years, but there’s already a second person who wants to clean up the Scarlet Cloud World. Does the Heavenly Court not have any patrols?”

“Yes, we will send stronger Heavenly Generals

next.”

“Where’s the Flame Lord Emperor? Have you found him?”

“We found him. He’s recuperating.” “That’s good!” Han Jue didn’t ask what happened to the Flame Lord Emperor. He was just a nobody and didn’t want to be involved too much. Di Taibai didn’t continue chatting. After severing the divine sense connection, Han Jue began to meditate and cultivate.

No matter what, increasing his strength was the key.

Han Jue thought.

Life was like this.

Han Jue felt that he was already low profile enough, but he would still encounter trouble occasionally.

If he ascended, there might be more trouble.

No one could leave the mortal world completely, much less live a peaceful life.

He had to persist on his Dao heart!

He would cultivate on the same path as before!

Spring passed and autumn came.

Another forty years passed.

Han Jue finally reached the perfected Reincarnation Mystic Immortal Realm!

The Golden Immortal Realm was right in front of him!

Han Jue was excited.

He had waited a long time for this breakthrough. It was longer than any previous breakthrough.

After breaking through, Han Jue immediately took out the Book of Misfortune and started celebrating

At the same time, he opened his emails to check on his friends.

Han Jue continued reading. The cultivation mortal world was still considered calm. The Immortal World was really in chaos.

The Heavenly Court and the Demon Court had truly started a war!

This was even more exaggerated than when Great Sage Equaling Heaven had wreaked havoc in the Heavenly Court.

The Divine General was as ferocious as ever. He was surrounded by fifteen Immortal Emperors and was not severely injured. He even counterattacked.

Han Jue persisted in cursing. Several months later, the curse finally ended.

He continued to consolidate his cultivation and prepared to break through.

It was said that once one reached the Golden Immortal Realm, one could comprehend karma and deduce fate. They would almost gain immortality.

Han Jue was looking forward to it.

After reaching the Golden Immortal Realm, he wouldn’t be far from becoming an Immortal Emperor.

Of course, the Immortal Emperor Realm wasn’t Han Jue’s target.

He wanted to surpass the Deity Realm and the Zenith Heaven Realm!

Only by becoming the strongest could he continue living

About seven years passed.

Han Jue finally started to break through. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He chased Dao Comprehension Sword out.

Dao Comprehension Sword knew that he was about to break through and did not show any emotions.

The disciples under the Fusang Tree saw her coming out and didn’t care at first. But when the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain began to shake violently, they realized that Han Jue was breaking through. Murong Qi sighed. “Grandmaster’s talent is truly ridiculous. In both my previous and current lives, I’ve never seen anyone with greater talent than him.”

This was the truth.

In this life, when he got to know Han Jue, the latter had yet to reach the Immortal Realm.

Xun Chang’an smiled and said, “Actually, Master’s identity has always been very mysterious. He might be the reincarnation of an expert from the Immortal World.” The Black Hell Chicken laughed. “Hahaha, of course. My master is definitely powerful!”

The Golden Crow, Ah Da, said, “I’ve always felt that Master is extraordinary.”

Xiao Er nodded. They couldn’t forget the terror of being suppressed by Han Jue.

While everyone was discussing, Han Jue had already entered the important moment of breaking through.

In the Numinous Palace, Immortal Gods gathered.

The Heavenly Emperor sat at the head of the table with an expressionless face.

The atmosphere in the hall was very poor. Even the Divine General’s expression was dark.

“No one can kill that Immortal Emperor of the Demon Court?” the Heavenly Emperor asked.

The immortals looked at each other. 2402:800:6118:aaa7:e5ce:eb97:e203:6b0c

Giant Spiritual Martial God said in a low voice, “Your Majesty, can’t we invite those gods?”

The Heavenly Emperor said calmly, “The 24 Star Emperors are already on their way back. They suppressed the edge of the Chaos previously, so it will take them some time to return.”

The immortals were pleasantly surprised. “In that case, I’ll fight him again. Although I can’t kill him, he can forget about killing me,” the Divine General said. The other immortals urged. “No, once you attack, the dozens of Immortal Emperors of the Demon Court will come out in full force. They want to kill you too much!”

“Yes, the Demon Court views you as a thorn in their flesh!”

“Divine General, you just fought a huge battle. Don’t act recklessly.”

“The Heavenly Court cannot lose a Divine General!”

Hearing the immortals’ words, the Divine General frowned.

He understood the logic, but the Heavenly Court needed someone to stand up for them. Otherwise, they would lose all their reputation.

Ji Xianshen stood at the bottom of the Heavenly Generals. His blood surged. He wanted to stand out, but his cultivation was too weak.

If he was strong enough, this would be his chance to become famous.

The Heavenly Emperor glanced at Di Taibai and said, “In that case, let’s ask the Crown Prince.” Crown Prince!

The immortals were in an uproar!

The Divine General narrowed his eyes. Di Taibai was relieved.

He smiled and said, “His Highness the Crown Prince has been waiting for a long time. He’s just waiting for His Majesty to speak.” An old immortal hurriedly asked, “Isn’t His Highness the Crown Prince in Kunlun?”

The Heavenly Emperor said calmly, “I brought him along when I returned from Kunlun. He should be unrivaled in the Emperor Realm now.”

The immortals were even more excited.

The Heavenly Emperor had many sons, but one of them was a legend of the Heavenly Court. Before the rise of the Divine General, he was the Court’s signature combatant. Ji Xianshen was secretly curious. How strong was that Crown Prince to actually make the immortals so excited?

Ten years later.

Han Jue finally broke through!

Early-stage Reincarnation Golden Immortal Realm!

Just as he broke through, Han Jue’s Dharmic powers began to increase, and his soul also sublimated. His consciousness jumped out of the five elements and arrived in a gray space.
