Chapter 174 Reincarnation Heaven Immortal Realm, Sword God Emperor

“Oh? Since you’ve heard of me, it means that you’re from the same world as me. Take me as your master. Your potential is very good. I can make you second in the world!” Ji Xianshen said proudly. He had only helped Fang Liang because he saw that he was talented.

Fang Liang wiped the blood off his face and smiled with difficulty. “You’re the number one in the world? Are you serious?”

Ji Xianshen frowned, feeling a little panicked.

The news of him losing to Han Jue had not spread. How did this person know?

“I’m from the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. You’ve looked for my Grandmaster several times. Have you forgotten?” Fang Liang asked with a smile.

Ji Xianshen was moved. Endless embarrassment and anger occupied his heart.

“You are Guan… Cao Cao’s grand-disciple?” Ji Xianshen asked in shock.

“That’s right! Previously, you looked for my Grandmaster. I saw it on the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.”

“You…”

At this moment, Ji Xianshen suddenly had the urge to silence them.

However, Fang Liang was Han Jue’s grand-disciple. He couldn’t do anything to him.

In the entire world, only Cao Cao was his good and close friend.

The two of them had agreed to fight Heavenly Court together!

With such a relationship, Fang Liang could be considered his grand-junior.

“Haha, so that’s how it is. Fellow Daoist Cao’s grand-disciple is indeed not simple. Since I’m close friends with your grandmaster, why don’t we travel the Demon Realm together? If you die here, Fellow Daoist Cao will also be sad.” Ji Xianshen laughed and landed behind Fang Liang, using his spirit energy to heal him.

Fang Liang said, “Actually, I was once a disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Manor. My name is Fang Liang. Have you heard of me?”

Ji Xianshen replied, “No. I’ve never bothered finding out about anyone in the Heavenly Immortal Manor, nor do I care about the other disciples.”

How pretentious!

Fang Liang complained inside.

However, he was still very curious about Ji Xianshen.

He was the number one in the world, even if that was only on the surface!

Five years later.

Han Jue forcefully broke through to the early stage of the Reincarnation Heaven Immortal Realm!

His Dharmic powers surged!

His soul was elevated!

In conclusion, it was awesome!

The entire Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain shook.

Dao Comprehension Sword had been chased out of the cave abode a year ago. She was discussing this with others.

“Master broke through again?” The Three-Headed Wyrm King asked in surprise.

Yang Tiandong sighed. “Master is not only cultivating diligently, but his talent is also far beyond ours.” Chu Shiren was heartbroken.

He had broken through again!

No!

I have to persuade Grandmaster!

He suddenly stood up and walked towards the cave abode. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

However, just as he approached the cave abode’s entrance, he was sent flying by a terrifying force, vomiting blood.

Yang Tiandong hurriedly caught him.

The Black Hell Chicken smiled teasingly. “Yang Tiandong, you have to take care of your disciple. If his thoughts are discovered by Master, he will die very miserably.”

Everyone knew that Han Jue was only interested in cultivation.

Trying to persuade Han Jue not to cultivate was definitely courting death.

Yang Tiandong smiled bitterly. He looked at the unconscious Chu Shiren and felt a headache.

Five years!

Five whole years!

This fellow really didn’t cultivate!

Unimaginable!

How could there be such a person in the world who had unparalleled talent but did not want to cultivate?

It was simply against the Heavenly Dao!

If not for Chu Shiren’s rare aptitude, Yang Tiandong would have slapped him to death.

“When his lifespan is up, he will know that he needs to cultivate.” Dao Comprehension Sword covered her mouth and laughed.

Seeing Chu Shiren’s attitude made her feel better.

Fortunately, she did not rush to take him in as a disciple.

Ah Da suddenly said, “Although he doesn’t cultivate, his soul is very strong. It contains an aura that makes us siblings palpitate.”

Xiao Er nodded.

With that said, the others couldn’t help but look at Chu Shiren curiously.

On the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain, other than Han Jue, no one was stronger than the two Golden Crows!

Where did Chu Shiren come from?

14 million years of lifespan! Who else could compare to him!

Han Jue was really arrogant now.

A thousand-year-old Heaven Immortal was unparalleled in the myriad worlds!

But he couldn’t be proud.

The two little Golden Crows were born with Mahayana Realm cultivation. Such talent was only at the bottom of the Golden Crow Divine Clan. It was difficult to imagine how ridiculous the number one prodigy was.

Han Jue suppressed his excitement and consolidated his cultivation. [The Dao Field’s defense has been raised to the Grand Unity True Immortal Realm. It can defend against all attacks below the Grand Unity True Immortal Realm.]

[Congratulations on breaking through to the Reincarnation Heaven Immortal Realm. You have the following choices:]

[1: Immediately ascend and become an Immortal God. You can obtain a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.)

[2: Don’t ascend for the time being. Continue cultivating. You can obtain a bottle of Golden Pills from the Dao Sect.]

Han Jue didn’t hesitate and chose the second option.

Information regarding the Golden Pill of the Dao Sect appeared before his eyes.

[Dao Sect Golden Pill: The Dao Sect created a Golden Pill that can increase one’s cultivation. It has the effect of reviving the dead, restoring the body, and increasing one’s lifespan by ten thousand years.]

Not bad! Not bad!

He could use it to save his life!

Although Han Jue was confident, he was not arrogant. What if his body was destroyed one day?

However, could souls consume pills?

The Dao Sect was quite something. Han Jue continued to consolidate his cultivation.

A year later, his cultivation level completely stabilized at the early stage of the Reincarnation Heaven Immortal Realm.

After calling Dao Comprehension Sword back in, he began to comprehend the Three Pure World Cleansing

In less than five minutes, he stepped into the Sword Dao River.

Compared to before, it was a complete transformation!

It had been a long time since he last saw Zhang Guxing. Han Jue missed him.

Of course, the most important thing was to posture.

Han Jue walked in front of Zhang Guxing and showed his cultivation without hesitation.

Zhang Guxing sensed his aura and nodded in satisfaction. He smiled and said, “Not bad, you have reached the Heaven Immortal… Wait! “How did you do this?

“Are you possessed by an Immortal Emperor?”

Zhang Guxing’s tone was filled with fear.

This kid cultivates too quickly!

It doesn’t make sense!

Han Jue smiled and said, “There’s no such thing. I cultivated diligently every day and tried my best to reach this cultivation level.”

Zhang Guxing said with a strange tone, “The Heavenly Court is going to suffer.”

(Zhang Guxing’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 5 stars]

Han Jue smiled in satisfaction.

This good brother was really predictable.

[The Sword God Emperor has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 3 stars]
