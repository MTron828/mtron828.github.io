Chapter 849 Killing the Divine Authority Generals With One Sword

Han Jue immediately disappeared from the Universal Hall after comforting the Foolish Sword Sage and Red Fate.

In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals. He instantly used the simulation trial to copy their cultivation levels and disappeared.

The entire process was too fast, so fast that Han Jue seemed to have never appeared.

The other Sages did not notice his disappearance.

Han Jue predicted that it would take at least five minutes for the Divine Authority Generals to arrive.

He immediately entered the simulation trial and challenged ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.

He fused with 1,949 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols and waved the Primordial Judgment Sword with the Primordial Divine Rage. With a slash, supreme sword Qi swept out and destroyed all ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.

Instant kill!

Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.

He secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

Indeed, nothing happened.

He was really afraid that after the battle in the Grand Primordium Domain, the Divine Authority Generals would be strengthened.

......

He entered the simulation trial again. This time, he did not attack first to test the Divine Authority Generals’ power.

Several breaths later, Han Jue opened his eyes and pondered.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du turned around and asked, “Fellow Daoist Han, are you confident?”

He could already sense the terrifying aura of ten thousand Divine Authority Generals. He believed that Han Jue could also sense it. In terms of aura, there was probably a number.

In any case, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du felt that he would die if he went out.

The aura of ten thousand Divine Authority Generals gathered together was too powerful, so powerful that it crushed all wishful thinking!

The other Sages looked at Han Jue, all filled with anticipation and nervousness.

They were afraid when they truly felt the aura of the Divine Authority Generals. Even Zhou Fan, Long Hao, Zhao Xuanyuan, and the others who had shouted earlier did not dare to brag.

Facing their gazes, Han Jue said, “You probably won’t believe me if I say that I’m confident. I’ll try my best. Don’t go out. Just watch me fight the Divine Authority Generals.”

The Sages heaved a sigh of relief.

They were afraid of being sent out to fight. Although they were ashamed, this was the heartless truth.

er

Han Jue suddenly stood up and took out the Primordial Judgment Sword.

The sword overflowed and purple-red light shone in the hall, dazzling the Sages. At the same time, they felt a terrifying killing intent.

Killing intent!

Pan Xin was stunned as he thought of his Heaven-Opening Axe.

Curse the Life faction for seizing my Supreme Treasure!

Han Jue raised the Primordial Judgment Sword with one hand under the Sages’ gazes. The tip of the sword pointed at the Divine Authority Generals attacking from the Chaos. Shadows appeared above Han Jue’s head and quickly entered his body.

In an instant, Han Jue had already fused with 1,949 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols!

He raised his left hand and stretched out his index and middle fingers. He slowly slid them along the blade as if he was holding a gun. His gaze and the tip of the sword looked in the same direction, aiming at something.

The Sages were extremely nervous, not understanding what he wanted to do.

Zhou Fan couldn’t help but ask, “Master, what do you want to do?”

Was he going to attack from here?

Such a ridiculous thought appeared in the minds of all the Sages.

They were the Divine Authority Generals!

Wouldn’t the enemy be alarmed if he attacked from so far away?

Han Jue said expressionlessly, “Everyone, tell me, can my sword kill ten thousand Divine Authority Generals?”.

The entire Universal Hall fell silent.

The Sages widened their eyes and breathed heavily.

Even Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and Lao Dan were the same.

Lao Dan did not speak, but he was already prepared to escape with Dao Sovereign and the other two when the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals arrived.

He didn’t expect Han Jue to be so arrogant!

Killing ten thousand Divine Authority Generals with a single strike?

No one dared to jump out and question him. They all stared at the Primordial Judgment Sword in Han Jue’s hand in a daze.

Their hearts beat faster.

If Han Jue was really…

Gasp

They did not dare to continue thinking. Logic told them that it was impossible!

That was a terrifying power that could destroy dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials!

Even the Giant God of Creation, Pangu, died at the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals’ feet!

In the mysterious space, murky mist filled the air.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor stood in front of a mysterious shadow that shone with a strong light. Between the two sides, an illusion floated and reflected the scene of ten thousand Divine Authority Generals galloping.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s expression was ugly as he felt the terrifying aura of the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.

He had encountered Divine Authority Generals before. They had always walked forward calmly. This was the first time they were running so quickly. This was an obvious sign that they were determined to flatten the Heavenly Dao!

The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked up and asked, “Senior, are you really not allowed to make a move?

“I only want you to save the Hidden Sect!”

The mysterious giant shadow said faintly, “I won’t enter karma or the Chaos. I naturally won’t interfere. Evil Heavenly Emperor, don’t try to interfere. Behind the Divine Authority Generals are the Supreme Rules and the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. Any existence that dares to stop them will be doomed.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor suddenly knelt down and gritted his teeth. “Senior, please make a move! I’m willing to serve you forever and be your pawn!

“Senior always said that you won’t enter the Chaos, but you always pay attention to it. I know that you have your ambitions. I’m willing to serve you no matter what. Since Senior can see me many times, you must have a use for me.”

The mysterious giant shadow did not answer.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor was still kneeling as he stared at the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals in the illusion.

He was extremely nervous.

The Divine Authority Generals’ speed was tremendous and their strength was terrifying. They could flatten the Heavenly Dao in an instant once they reached it!

The Evil Heavenly Emperor was originally confident in Han Jue, but he learned a terrifying piece of information.

The mysterious giant shadow said, “I’ve already told you that it’s impossible for ten thousand Divine Authority Generals to be destroyed. This is the Supreme Rule of the Chaos unless they have the strength to overturn the Chaos. Besides, even if I kill ten thousand Divine Authority Generals, an even more terrifying force will appear next. The Heavenly Dao is already at a dead end. There’s no way out.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor was moved. He suddenly looked up and asked in a low voice, “Is there an existence stronger than you in the Chaos?”

The mysterious giant shadow said, “Perhaps not, but the Chaos itself is the strongest.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor was indignant and was about to continue speaking.

At this moment!

A terrifying killing intent came from the illusion, startling him.

A sword Qi attacked from the depths of the darkness, striking the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals!

So fast!

Before the Evil Heavenly Emperor could think further, he saw the sword Qi drown the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals. It was unstoppable and incomparably domineering, shocking the Dark Forbidden Zone! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The sword Qi dissipated, and a huge hole was torn in the Dark Forbidden Zone. Layer after layer of space shattered, revealing the Primordial Void.

The Divine Authority Generals had already vanished.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor was stunned.

He blinked and stood up to take a closer look, but he still did not see the Divine Authority Generals.

“Senior, where’s the Divine Authority Generals? Hurry up and turn to them!” the Evil Heavenly Emperor urged anxiously.

However, he did not receive a reply.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked, “Senior?”

The mysterious giant shadow said faintly, “The Divine Authority Generals are gone…”

“Gone? What do you mean?”

Evil Heavenly Emperor’s heart beat faster than ever as he asked carefully.

If he was not wrong… the Divine Authority Generals were killed by that sword Qi?

Killing ten thousand Divine Authority Generals in one strike?

How was that possible…
