Chapter 159 Eighth-Grade Heavenly General, Daoist Dan Qing

Han Jue stared at Yang Yanjun. Seeing that she didn’t escape, he was overjoyed

Since you’re so bold, don’t even think about leaving!

Han Jue waved his sword again. The sea of Sword Qi in the sky condensed countless sword shadows again and attacked Yang Yanjun with the momentum of a collapsing sky. It was unstoppable! Yang Yanjun was shocked and immediately moved. However, at that moment, as soon as her Dharmic powers dissipated, she was injured by Han Jue’s sword Qi. She moved dozens of kilometers away, and just as she appeared, she was so angry that a mouthful of blood rushed up to her throat.

Boom

Yang Yanjun raised her hand and waved, causing the flying dagger to tear through the air and land in her hand again. “Damn it! If not for the heavenly rules, how could I be in such a sorry state!”

Yang Yanjun cursed angrily. She threw the flying dagger above her head and quickly cast a spell with both hands.

Boom!

The world trembled as the Spirit Qi of the land gathered towards her flying dagger, forming a visible airwave. It was a spectacular sight.

She had no intention of escaping. She still wanted to fight!

Han Jue completely infuriated her!

Swish!

A piercing sound came!

It was the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger!

Yang Yanjun was already mentally prepared and immediately dodged.

Just as she turned around, Han Jue appeared behind her! He used the Somersault Cloud as a foundation last year to create a Grand Unity movement technique. He could jump behind the enemy with just one follow-up move. It was extremely precise.

Yang Yanjun saw him from the corner of her eye and her pupils widened.

Impossible!

A black sword Qi suddenly erupted and soared into the sky. It was like a brush waving towards the sky, hanging high above the ground.

Yang Yanjun’s body was directly destroyed by Han Jue’s sword Qi, leaving only her essence soul in front of him.

“I’m a disciple of the Dragon Immortal Island! My Senior Brother is a Heavenly General of the Heavenly Court!” Yang Yanjun exclaimed. Just as she finished speaking, she immediately turned around and her essence soul flew away.

Han Jue waved his sword, and a million sword shadows came from all directions, directly killing her.

She was finally dead!

Was the Heavenly General very impressive?

I’m a descendant of an Immortal Emperor!

Han Jue secretly felt disdain.

With things developing to this point, even if he let Yang Yanjun go, it was impossible to end this bad karma!

Han Jue raised his left hand and sucked in a storage ring and a flying dagger into his palm.

He flew towards the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.

Along the way, he did not find Daoist Jueyan’s storage ring. It was probably destroyed by the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger.

After returning to the Fusang Tree, everyone immediately surrounded him. Even Xing Hongxuan, Fairy Xi Xuan, Chang Yue’er, and Li Qingzi were there.

“Master, how’s the situation?”

“Who are those two?”

“Grandmaster is too powerful!”

“Need you ask? They’re definitely dead!”

“Who in the world can survive against our master?”

Everyone was very excited. In the past, Han Jue almost always killed his enemies instantly. It was rare for him to fight in such a manner.

They couldn’t forget the sword shadows that filled the sky and the pressure that made their souls tremble.

The Three-Headed Wyrm King was the most shocked. He, who was at the sixth level of the Mahayana Realm, was also forced to kneel on the ground. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

What did that mean?

This meant that Han Jue and Yang Yanjun had definitely surpassed the Mahayana Realm and were at the Immortal Realm!

Han Jue smiled and said, “It’s fine. You can continue cultivating.”

With that said, he returned to the Connate Cave Abode.

There was no need to tell others about some things. It would only cause panic.

When Daoist Nine Cauldrons saw that the battle had ended, he hurriedly got the elders to comfort the disciples.

Today’s battle caused the Deity Slaying Elder’s name to shake the sect again.

After so many years, many disciples had almost forgotten about the Deity Slaying Elder.

The most excited were the new disciples. They didn’t expect the Deity Slaying Elder to be so terrifying!

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

As Han Jue started to check Yang Yanjun’s storage ring, Dao Comprehension Sword came over curiously.

Yang Yanjun was indeed from the Upper World. She was really rich. She had Dharma treasures, spell scrolls, divine power scrolls, and so on. She had everything she needed and many pills that could help Loose Immortals cultivate.

He had made a killing!

(Yang San has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]

[Daoist Dan Qing has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 3 stars]

Two lines of words appeared in front of Han Jue.

He wasn’t surprised.

To sum it up, there were only two words.

A loop!

After killing the young, the old would come.

Was this the cycle of life?

Everyone was interconnected in some way!

If someone killed Han Jue’s disciples, he would definitely take revenge.

Moreover, the people of the Upper World definitely have a Mystical Power that could deduce who had killed the person they cared about.

Only the two of them had developed hatred towards Han Jue. He felt that it was too small of a number.

It seemed that Yang Yanjun was not good with interpersonal relationships.

Han Jue pulled out his interpersonal relationships and started to check their information.

(Yang San: Late-stage Grand Unity Earth Immortal, eighth-grade Heavenly General of the Heavenly Court. Because you killed his beloved Junior Sister Yang Yanjun and his subordinate, Daoist Jueyan, who was supposed to be nurtured, he has developed hatred towards you. He won’t rest until you’re dead. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]

[Daoist Dan Qing: Mid-stage Grand Unity True Immortal, one of the Seven Daoists of the Dragon Immortal Island. He has developed hatred towards you because you killed his beloved disciple, Yang Yanjun. If you meet, he will definitely kill you. Current Hatred Points: 3 stars]

Late-stage Grand Unity Earth Immortal Realm!

Mid-stage Grand Unity True Immortal realm! Great!

They were all very strong!

Han Jue forced a smile and panicked internally.

However, he noticed that Daoist Dan Qing’s message said that if they met, that meant that he would not descend into the mortal world?

There was also Yang San.

As a Heavenly General of Heavenly Court, when it was time to clean up the devils, this fellow would definitely lead the team personally.

No!

He had to be cursed!

Han Jue didn’t curse immediately. He would curse again after some time to avoid being discovered. Once Yang San and Daoist Dan Qing discovered that Han Jue was cursing them, they would definitely get rid of him as soon as possible.

In a bright hall, the stone pillars and decorations shook. A handsome man sat at the head of the table. He wore a loose Daoist robe. At this moment, his face was filled with anger, and the killing intent in his eyes was almost tangible.

“Junior Sister…”

Yang San gritted his teeth and clenched his fists.

His eyes were bloodshot, and his eyeballs were about to turn into blood beads.

“It’s all my fault… I shouldn’t have let Junior Sister go… If I had waited longer, when the Heavenly Court took away the heavenly rules, how would her cultivation level at the early-stage Grand Unity Earth Immortal Realm be restricted to the Loose Immortal Realm and how would she die?” Yang San muttered in pain.

How could he have expected Loose Immortals to be hidden in the mortal world!

It was all Daoist Jueyan’s fault!

This fellow kept urging him to descend into the mortal world, but he ended up dragging his Junior Sister down with him!

Whoever he is, that fellow is so ruthless. He even killed a woman without a second thought! His Junior Sister had already announced her identity in the end, but he actually did not give them face!

Yang San hated Han Jue so much that he wanted to cut him into pieces.

When he caught Han Jue, he would let him taste the most painful punishment!

“No, I have to report this to an Immortal Official!”

Yang San immediately stood up and turned into a gust of wind, rushing out of the hall.

After killing Yang Yanjun and Daoist Jueyan, Han Jue removed Yang Yanjun’s flying dagger and gave it to Su Qi.

Su Qi happened to lack a powerful Dharma treasure.

Han Jue took out Yang Yanjun’s pills and continued cultivating. He wanted to break through to the mid-stage of the Reincarnation Loose Immortal Realm as soon as possible.

With his strength, it was very difficult for him to defeat a late-stage Grand Unity Earth Immortal.

A year later.

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Yang San!

From now on, the Vermilion Bird’s curse could be delayed. Yang San was his top target!

Just as he started cursing, a line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
