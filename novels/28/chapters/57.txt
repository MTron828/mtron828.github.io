Chapter 60: Finally Achieving the Void Amalgamation Realm! Birth Dharma Treasure!

Destruction of the entire sect?

Han Jue was stunned and gasped at his amazing power.

As expected of Heavenly Court’s jinx!

He was a walking nuclear bomb!

However, Han Jue had never heard of the Green Ghost Sect. It was probably a small sect somewhere.

A truly powerful cultivation sect would not be unable to overcome a heavenly tribulation that was rare even in a few hundred years.

Perhaps with Su Qi, Han Jue would be able to finish off the Demon Taming Sect?

Han Jue noticed that Mo Fuchou was being pursued by the righteous cultivators.

He had completely fallen into the demonic path!

It had to be said, the outside world was truly exciting and things were ever-changing.

Fortunately, he chose to cultivate in a low-key manner.

If he was like Mo Fuchou, Zhou Fan, and Li Qingzi, how painful would that be?

There was also his disciple. He said that he had gone to participate in the Cultivation Conference but was attacked by a Demon King.

Fortunately, he had survived.

If he died outside, Han Jue would be speechless.

Something worthy of mentioning was that Li Qianlong had not appeared recently. Could it be that he had successfully cursed him?

Han Jue shook his head and prepared to head to the Ten Thousand Demon Realm.

...

In a dark valley, Li Qianlong leaned against the wall and held his breath.

A dozen cultivators stood beside him.

Looking up, countless demons circled above the valley.

A young cultivator by Li Qianlong’s side couldn’t help but grumble, “Senior Li, don’t you know the way? Why did you bring us to the Demon Cave?”

The other cultivators were also frightened.

They were all cultivators of the Wei Family.

Li Qianlong followed the Poison King’s instructions and found the Wei Family. He spent a few years taking in their eldest son and established a good relationship with him. This time, he left the Great Yan with the Wei Family and was prepared to rope in other powerful sects in the cultivation world.

However, something went wrong when they used a teleportation formation. They were directly teleported to the Demon Cave. There were countless demons here, and there was even a Demon King whose strength was extremely terrifying. Even Li Qianlong found it difficult to defeat him.

Li Qianlong was also very depressed.

In recent years, his luck had been extremely bad.

He had been struck by lightning during his journey and encountered a mental demon during his cultivation. He had robbed a young cultivator, but in the end, he was a Soul Formation cultivator pretending to be weak.

This time, it was even worse for the Wei Family.

“No! I haven’t had my revenge! I can’t die here!” Li Qianlong gritted his teeth.

...

Pet Beast Pavilion.

Dozens of disciples were gathered, including Daoist Jingxu.

“From today onwards, all disciples are not to enter the Ten Thousand Demon Realm and must await the open notice,” Daoist Jingxu said expressionlessly.

A disciple of the main peak couldn’t help but ask, “Master, what happened in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm?”

The other disciples were also very curious.

Every disciple would go to the Ten Thousand Demon Realm to capture demon beasts and increase their confidence in traveling the cultivation world.

Daoist Jingxu said calmly, “Deity Slaying Elder is undergoing tribulation. Perhaps he’s cultivating a Mystical Power.”

She never thought that Han Jue would break through to the Void Amalgamation Realm.

It had only been a few decades.

Impossible!

It had taken Daoist Nine Cauldrons more than a thousand years to reach the Void Amalgamation Realm. One had to know that Daoist Nine Cauldrons was the number one genius in the Great Yan Cultivation World!

Whoosh—

The disciples were in an uproar.

“Deity Slaying Elder is inside?”

“Wow, I’ve never seen the Deity Slaying Elder before.”

“It’s said that Deity Slaying Elder is the strongest pillar of the Jade Pure Sect. He has been cultivating in seclusion.”

“No one can match Deity Slaying Elder’s cultivation persistence. It’s said that Deity Slaying Elder looks better than all men and women in the world.”

“I really want to see Deity Slaying Elder’s true appearance.”

“Is Deity Slaying Elder accepting a disciple?”

The disciples were very excited and discussed non-stop.

The news spread very quickly. More and more disciples rushed over, completely blocking the Pet Beast Pavilion.

All the disciples had heard of the legendary deeds of the Deity Slaying Elder!

Some people even said that the reason why the Jade Pure Sect could be where it was today was because of the Deity Slaying Elder.

Several days later, Guan Yougang rushed over.

When he saw so many people gathered outside the building, he cursed angrily. “All of you, scram. Whoever dares to gather here will be banished to the outer sect!”

With that said, all the disciples scattered.

Guan Yougang came to the counter and said, “Activate the formation. I’m going to the Ten Thousand Demon Realm!”

The person-in-charge hesitated. “Daoist Jingxu said that no one is allowed...”

“Who do you think I am?”

After hearing that, the person hurriedly activated the teleportation formation.

...

After seven days and seven nights of persistence, Han Jue finally survived the powerful heavenly tribulation and advanced to become a Void Amalgamation Realm cultivator!

With his ability, the heavenly tribulation could not kill him!

Han Jue was stunned.

...

His lifespan increased to 8,940 years!

Awesome!

Han Jue also noticed that his identity as a human had changed to “Mortal Transcendence Stage”.

Was this a hint that he was on the path to becoming an Immortal?

Han Jue was in a good mood.

After two hundred years of boring cultivation, anyone else would have gone mad.

But he was used to this; he even enjoyed it.

This feeling of steadily becoming stronger was too good!

The reason why mortals hated cultivation was that they could not feel themselves becoming stronger most of the time.

However, Han Jue was different. His potential was outstanding and he became stronger almost every day.

Reaching the Void Amalgamation Realm meant that he was truly invincible in the Great Yan Cultivation World!

Next...

Of course, he had to continue charging into the Body Integration Realm!

Han Jue thought firmly.

At this moment, a voice sounded, “Deity Slaying Elder, I’m Guan Yougang. After you consolidate your cultivation, let’s spar. If I defeat you, I will become the Sect Master!”
