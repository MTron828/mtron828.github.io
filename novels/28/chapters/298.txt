Chapter 300 Undercover of the Buddhist Sect, Expanding the Hidden Sect Island

The opening of the simulation trial caused the Hidden Sect to become lively. In the first month, all the disciples were immersed in the simulation trial and often exchanged their combat experiences, including Fairy Xi Xuan, Chang Yue’er, and Li Yao.

This method of fighting without creating enemies was fascinating.

It was like a person who had never played games before experiencing an online game. Too addictive!

Han Jue didn’t participate and continued cultivating

As the Immortal Qi and Connate Qi in the Dao Field increased, Han Jue’s cultivation speed also began to increase.

The Buzhou Divine Flower was also growing faster. It would probably mature completely in a few decades.

Years passed.

Ten years later, the craze brought by the simulation trial finally cooled down. However, two people were still immersed. They were Murong Qi and Tu Ling’er.

Most importantly, these two were still growing stronger in battle.

The others were extremely envious.

Han Jue didn’t stop them after knowing that they were still becoming stronger.

The War God and the Grand Magus were natural battle maniacs! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the Heavenly Dao Buddha.

While cursing, he checked his emails.

(Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by your enemy Heavenly Dao Buddha.]

(Your good friend Divine General was attacked by the Demon Race’s Immortal Emperor] x39 (Your good friend Divine General is dead. A trace of his soul managed to escape.]

(Your Dao Companion Xing Hongxuan obtained an Ancient Treasure by chance. Her providence has increased greatly.)

(Your good friend Jiang Yi was attacked by a Ghost Deity.)

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by the Devil Race] X263120

(Your good friend Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil has entered the body of a Buddha and transformed into the Devil Heart.]

Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat when he saw that the Divine General died.

He couldn’t help but think of the Heavenly Emperor corpse he had seen when he had deduced the heavenly secrets. How long could the Heavenly Court last?

Sigh.

The Immeasurable Calamity was really dangerous.

Han Jue could only warn himself not to enter the calamity, or he would be as miserable as the Heavenly Court.

The only thing he could help the Heavenly Emperor with was cursing the Heavenly Dao Buddha.

In addition, Han Jue noticed that the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil he had not seen for many years had finally become the Devil Heart again. Previously, this fellow was the White-Robed Buddha’s Devil Heart. After being subdued by Han Jue, he had been hiding in outer space.

This was a good thing. In the future, the Buddhist Sect would have another spy he planted.

There was also a spy in the Jie School.

Wait!

Why do I feel like I’m actually the Dark Forbidden Lord now?

No!

I’m doing this to protect myself. I’m not fighting for world domination.

Han Jue consoled himself and relaxed again.

A month later, he put down the Book of Misfortune and continued cultivating.

The Buzhou Divine Flower beside the Nine Heavens Galaxy Water could already provide enough Connate Qi for Han Jue to cultivate. In addition to the Fusang Tree, the Resurrection Lily, and the Dao Field, the Immortal Qi in Hidden Sect Island was extremely abundant. Murong Qi had said that even the Heavenly Court did not have one-fifth of the Immortal Qi of this place.

The 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus also converted negative karma faster and faster. Han Jue’s cultivation speed could be said to be very fast.

If this continued, he would break through to the Rank Four Immortal Emperor Realm in less than a hundred years!

Han Jue looked forward to that day.

Duan Hongchen was still imprisoned in the Primordial World. Like the Black Hell Demon Lord, he was extremely afraid. He was afraid that his soul would be devoured by the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.

Han Jue planned to continue torturing him until he died or submitted.

During the Immeasurable Calamity, killing enemies would cause one to inherit the other party’s negative karma. Although Han Jue could absorb negative karma, it required time. If he directly inherited the huge negative karma of Duan Hongchen, it would definitely attract bad luck.

Every time he thought of Duan Hongchen, Han Jue would wonder how many people were facing the calamity.

Thirty years later.

The first inner sect competition of the Hidden Sect ended. They all competed in the simulation trial. Han Jue was first, the Black Hell Demon Lord was second, and the White-Robed Buddha was third. There was no surprise about the top three.

The fourth was Murong Qi. He had suppressed the Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm’s Black Hell Phoenix. As expected of the War God.

The fifth was Li Yao. At the perfected Grand Unity Mystic Immortal Realm, she could also challenge a Grand Unity Golden Immortal.

Next were two Black Hell Phoenixes.

The weakest was the Chaotic Heavenly Dog.

Fairy Xi Xuan and Chang Yue’er didn’t participate. This was specially permitted by Han Jue. After all, they were both mortals. Joining this competition was completely humiliating and pointless.

The Chaotic Heavenly Dog sank into depression.

Zhou Mingyue was also depressed. He had been targeted by his master, Chu Shiren.

Chu Shiren didn’t defeat anyone. He was even defeated by the Chaotic Heavenly Dog. However, he had defeated Zhou Mingyue and won very forcefully. The others could tell that there was something wrong with the master and disciple, but they didn’t say anything.

After the competition ended, the disciples cultivated even harder, not wanting to be surpassed.

In terms of cultivation, Han Jue was getting closer and closer to becoming a Rank Four Immortal Emperor.

On this day.

Han Jue came to Fairy Xi Xuan’s cave abode. Chang Yue’er also came. He prepared to preach the Dao to them.

“Where’s Xing Hongxuan? Why haven’t we seen each other for so many years?” Chang Yue’er asked curiously.

Han Jue didn’t hide anything and told her that Xing Hongxuan had already reincarnated.

Chang Yue’er was shocked. How could this happen? Fairy Xi Xuan looked at him in surprise. Han Jue’s powers could already affect reincarnation?

Han Jue smiled. “You don’t have to think too much. Cultivate here in peace. If you want to return to the Reroll World, I can send you back. I don’t need you to cultivate to a high level.”

That was the truth. He was willing to raise the two women mainly to reminisce about the past.

Seeing them, Han Jue could think of his weak past. He was vigilant and couldn’t become arrogant. He couldn’t stop cultivating.

“I don’t want to go back. I’ll stay here and follow you. Who knows, I might be able to live forever.” Chang Yue’er giggled. She was usually very hardworking. Other than cultivating, Han Jue would also give her the various arrays and prescriptions he had obtained and let her study them.

Chang Yue’er was suitable to be an all-rounded talent. It would be difficult for her to achieve anything just by cultivating.

Fairy Xi Xuan said softly, “I’ll stay here. If you need us to do anything in the future, just tell us. You don’t have to care about our past relationships and treat us differently.”

She stared at Han Jue intently. Her gaze was as gentle as before.

Han Jue smiled. “There’s no special treatment. The other disciples don’t have anything to do, either.”

Then, he began to preach to the two women. They were already at the Mahayana Realm and were not far from the Loose Immortal Realm.

Han Jue left after half a year.

He didn’t return to his cave abode immediately but wandered around Hidden Sect Island.

Ever since the Dao Field had been upgraded, the space inside had begun to expand. A sea area appeared at the edge of the Island, formed by the Nether Spring Water that had wandered in this sea area. It was still in the area of the Dao Field and would not leave the Hidden Sect Island.

The Hidden Sect Island wasn’t small, to begin with. Ever since the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain was moved here, Immortal Qi filled the air. The desolate mountains on the island began to produce natural treasures and trees. It seemed like a paradise.

The disciples of the Hidden Sect also began to spread out across the island. The seven Black Hell Phoenixes gathered on a mountain, and the eight calabash brothers also occupied a mountain.

Han Jue walked forward leisurely. As he did so, a line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.

[Detected bearer of Connate providence, check its origin.]
