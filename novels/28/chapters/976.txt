Chapter 978 Huang Zuntian’s Future, The Dark Forbidden Lord Is Still Here

Han Jue agreed to fight with Han Ling, and the father and daughter entered the simulation trial.

Han Jue attacked the moment the fighting started.

Instant kill!

There was no argument.

Han Ling suddenly woke up with a stunned expression.

Han Jue’s expression didn’t change. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The Daoist temple was silent for a while before Han Ling said aggrievedly, “Father! How can you use your true strength! Even if you do, let me use my full strength first. I mainly want to test the power of this treasure.”

Han Jue said angrily, “There are so many opponents in the simulation trial. Isn’t it enough for you to try on them? You’re just too daring and want to find trouble with your father.”

“How can this be?!

“Hehe.

“I don’t care. Father, don’t attack first. Let me attack for a while.”

Han Jue couldn’t stand Han Ling’s coquettishness. He could only agree.

The second simulation trial began. Han Jue did not attack and let Han Ling use all sorts of methods on him.

He finally saw how powerful the Emperor Soldiers were.

Their cultivation was like the main body’s. They were ferocious, but they did not know any Mystical Powers. It was indeed like an army in the mortal world. It was very difficult for anyone of the same realm to stop Han Ling. However, they became useless if there was a difference in cultivation level, no matter how many Emperor Soldiers there were.

Han Ling couldn’t break through Han Jue’s defense no matter how she attacked.

In the end, she got tired and gave up.

The father and daughter opened their eyes. Han Ling sighed. She had suffered a blow.

Han Jue smiled proudly. “Do you know how powerful your father is? Why don’t you go out and ask around?”

Han Ling curled his lips. “Is that so? Then tell me your story again. Last time, you talked about attaining the Dao. What happened after that?”

She was really curious.

She was already invincible among her peers in the simulation trial. She could still resist even when facing a Great Dao Sage.

She had overestimated herself and fought with all the existences in the simulation trial, but no one pressured her so much.

Han Jue immediately started to tell his story.

He was naturally willing to show off in front of his daughter.

The story went on for a long time.

Han Ling sighed after he finished speaking.

Han Jue’s enemies and situations fascinated her. What would she do if she faced his previous dangers?

“I cultivated in seclusion so that my enemies can never guess my cultivation level.” Han Jue smiled.

Han Ling nodded. “I think so too. Father, don’t worry. I’ll never be arrogant.”

The father and daughter chatted for a while. Han Ling continued cultivating while Han Jue started to check his emails.

His circle of friends was very lively. His old friends had already grown up and could take charge. Han Jue sighed.

An email attracted his attention.

[Your good friend Huang Zuntian established the Great Dao World and his cultivation increased greatly.]

Great Dao World?

This was a key to attaining the Dao Creator Realm!

This fellow was something.

Han Jue thought for a moment before pulling Huang Zuntian into a dream.

The dream was the eighteen peaks of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. The green mountains and rivers were as beautiful as a painting.

Huang Zuntian’s aura became stronger. He wore a golden-patterned black robe and a purple jade dragon horn blue crown. His robe fluttered in the wind and he had a dignified expression.

Life Lord!

Huang Zuntian opened his eyes and saw Han Jue. He asked, “So it’s you. I have an opportunity and was looking for you. Do you want to hear it?”

Han Jue said, “No.”

Huang Zuntian immediately knelt down on one knee and cupped his fists. “Greetings, Master!”

He was excited and did not put on airs at all.

His achievements were indeed impressive, but he still felt that he was far inferior compared to Han Jue.

If not for Han Jue using the name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage to attract the attention of all living beings in the Chaos, he would not be where he was today.

With his understanding of Han Jue, he knew that the other party didn’t like to be in the limelight. Wasn’t he so ostentatious in the past millions of years to make all living beings forget them, the Calamity Life Controllers?

Ever since Han Jue reached the peak of the Chaos, the Ultimate God of Punishment had also looked for him and was willing to give him a chance. This made him even more respectful towards Han Jue.

He felt that all of this was thanks to Han Jue!

However, Han Jue didn’t look for him, so he didn’t dare to expose his relationship with him.

Han Jue said, “Did you create a world in the depths of your soul?”

Huang Zuntian was stunned. This was his secret. His master actually knew!

“Yes, Master is really powerful. You can even discover this,” Huang Zuntian replied respectfully with a look of admiration.

Han Jue said, “Don’t mention this to anyone, including your trusted aides.”

He told Huang Zuntian the information that the Chaotic Consciousness had told him.

Huang Zuntian trembled. He didn’t expect there to be a transcendent existence above the Chaos.

He took a deep breath and said, “Thank you for your reminder, Master. I originally wanted to move the Calamity Life Controllers in. Fortunately, you alerted me… I was almost exposed…”

An existence who could revive all living beings in the Chaos with a wave of his hand. How terrifying was that!

Han Jue said, “I believe you will hide well. I have been paying attention to you all these years. You did well and changed the image of Life in the hearts of all living beings. Are you going to participate in the Chaotic Assembly?”

Huang Zuntian replied, “Yes. The Life faction will be truly cleansed once I become a Great Dao Divine Spirit. Master, don’t worry. I won’t touch the Eternal Peak.”

Han Jue was speechless. “If you have the ability, go and fight for it. You don’t have to give me face. Han Huang is my son, but I also think highly of you. I’ve known you for far longer than my children!”

Huang Zuntian was touched and knelt down again.

Han Jue said, “Take good care of Li Daokong and Shi Dudao for me, but don’t say that it’s my intention.” “I understand, Master. Don’t worry!” Huang Zuntian immediately promised.

The dream shattered.

Han Jue opened his eyes and sighed.

Huang Zuntian, what a Huang Zuntian!

He could actually reach this point by himself!

Jiang Jueshi’s future was a Dao Creator. Could Huang Zuntian also succeed? Han Jue didn’t use the derivation function. Regardless, Han Jue would help him if Huang Zuntian had the ability.

It didn’t matter if there were more Dao Creators. In any case, Han Jue’s goal was to become a Creator Lord!

He could have as many people as he wanted as long as he was the best!

Then, Han Jue visited Shi Dudao, Divine Lord Peacock, and Jing Tiangong in the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord. He encouraged them to not be disappointed.

The Dark Forbidden Lord still had to stay.

Before absolute invincibility, the Dark Forbidden Lord could help him do many things.

Han Jue suddenly had an idea.

Should he visit Zhao Shuangquan and Azure Heaven Mystic in their dreams and nurture them in the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord? In the end, he would ask them to target the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. What would the Dao Creator think?

Han Jue could pay the price first. When the two of them were stronger, he would say his true thoughts and also check if there was a possibility of them becoming enemies.

Anyway, they couldn’t catch up to Han Jue no matter how strong they were.

“This method is fine, but I feel that there’s no need…

“Let’s cultivate. Cultivation is the key.”

Han Jue shook his head and laughed. Then, he entered his cultivation state.

Tens of thousands of years later.

Han Jue passed his eleven-millionth-year birthday, but it didn’t trigger the system’s choice reward. This meant that the choice reward would be triggered every ten million years in the future.
