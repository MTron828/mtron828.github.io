Chapter 909 Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, Half-Step Creator

Han Jue had no choice but to size him up again upon hearing that Ancestor Xitian and the others were also subdued by him.

Unknowingly, Huang Zuntian was already powerful enough to break Han Jue’s impression of him.

Before this, in Han Jue’s heart, Ancestor Xitian was definitely stronger than Huang Zuntian.

Han Jue suddenly wanted to calculate his future.

Huang Zuntian talked about his experiences in high spirits. He was no longer the mortal who had crawled around in the Jie School.

To Han Jue, time passed very quickly, but to Huang Zuntian, time passed very slowly. He looked extremely glorious now, but in fact, he had paid an unimaginable price and effort. He felt tired when he recalled it.

Scheming, power struggles, persuasion, and so on. He took every step very carefully, afraid that he would fail.

Huang Zuntian changed the topic and suddenly said seriously, “Master, my subordinates discovered something recently, something unusual that might endanger the Chaos.”

Han Jue didn’t say anything. This fellow actually learned to keep people in suspense!

Huang Zuntian was very good at reading people’s expressions and immediately said, “This place is in the Ancient Desolate. There is a forbidden land in the Ancient Desolate that leads to an unknown domain. The Dao Devils ran out of it. More and more Dao Devils appeared in the Ancient Desolate recently. I’m afraid it will become a huge problem.”

Han Jue narrowed his eyes and fell into deep thought.

Could it be that Ancestor Tian Xu was brewing a plan to take revenge on the Dao Ancestor?

It was very likely!

“The Ancient Desolate is a forbidden land. Some time ago, many mighty figures died inside, so no one is paying attention to it anymore. It was after this that the speed at which the Dao Devils in the Ancient Desolate increased far exceeded before. Such an increase in power must be for a reason. Most importantly, I didn’t find out the mastermind behind them. I only know that the Ancestor Tian Xu who created the first world in the Chaos was also a Dao Devil and was the strongest one,” Huang Zuntian said with a solemn expression. He seemed to have fought with Ancestor Tian Xu before, and his eyes revealed fear.

Han Jue’s expression changed slightly. Ancestor Tian Xu was a Dao Devil?

Could it be that there was someone else behind this?

Han Jue said, “I’ll pay attention to this matter. How does Life plan to become independent?”

The Great Dao Divine Spirits no longer chased after the Life faction after the Primordial Ancestor God died. This gave them a chance to rest.

Huang Zuntian said, “I plan to establish a lineage and live in seclusion. I’ll make plans when the lineage is perfected. The current Chaos looks peaceful, but I feel that there are undercurrents.”

Han Jue nodded. “It’s indeed time to settle down. Time will erase everything.”

The two of them chatted for a while more before he removed the dream.

This dream was mainly to tell Huang Zuntian that he still cared about him.

Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “I want to know who’s behind the Dao Devils?”

(100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)

100 trillion years was equivalent to a hundred times stronger than Laozi and ten times weaker than a Dao Creator.

It was not Ancestor Tian Xu!

Han Jue immediately chose to continue.

A figure appeared in his mind. His body was like green flames and he wore a white bone mask. His black hair fluttered wantonly like countless tentacles. It was ghastly and terrifying

Half-step Creator!

How impressive!

Han Jue was attracted by the words “Heavenly Dao Evil Spirit”. Was this fellow related to the Heavenly Dao?

It made sense when he thought about it carefully. The Ancient Desolate was formed by the shattering of the Primordial World. Most of it had transformed into the Ancient Desolate, and the remaining transformed into the Immortal World. The Ancient Desolate’s spirit was naturally related to the Heavenly Dao.

The Heavenly Dao did not seem powerful in the Chaos, but it was deliberately suppressed by the Dao Ancestor. In fact, the Heavenly Dao was ancient. They could cultivate to the top of the Chaos if it was any other living being

[100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[No]

Han Jue was a little disappointed.

However, on second thought, it made sense. After all, the other party was already half-step into the Creator Realm. He wasn’t someone a Great Dao Supreme could kill.

Han Jue didn’t think too much about it. He would wait for Divine Lord Peacock to escape. Then, he would directly inform him and let him worry.

After all, the Lord of Chaos was the Ultimate God of Punishment, not him, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.

Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating

Under the old tree.

Han Qing’er stared at the distant disciples in boredom. She yawned and muttered, “Why isn’t Second Brother out of seclusion yet? Is seclusion so fun?”

At her side, Qingluan’er smiled and said, “Your second brother has great ambitions. How can he be like you, cultivating diligently like your father one moment and feeling bored the next?”

Han Qing’er rolled her eyes and said, “In the past, I also had great ambitions, but I knew that there would be no place for me by Father’s side in the future the moment Second Brother was born. I might as well be a little darling enjoying life in peace. Why do I have to be competitive?”

She believed that any prodigy would lose their confidence when they saw Han Huang, especially when this fellow was her biological brother.

Qingluan’er covered her mouth and laughed.

At this moment, Han Huang’s Daoist temple suddenly opened. A figure slowly walked out and arrived in front of them in a few steps.

Han Qing’er looked at the person in front of her and was stunned.

Qingluan’er’s eyes lit up as she praised him. “You’re really becoming more and more like your father.”

It was Han Huang.

He was handsome and tall. His eyes were filled with arrogance. His white robe fluttered and his black hair was tied behind his head with a thin rope. Not only was his talent unparalleled, but so was his temperament.

Han Qing’er snorted. “You still remember how to come out!”

Han Huang smiled. “Qing’er, I’ve already attained the Great Dao and even created my own Mystical Power. Am I powerful?”

“Impressive, impressive!” Han Qing’er said perfunctorily, but she was shocked inside.

She knew that Han Huang was monstrous, but she didn’t expect him to be talented to this extent.

Great Dao!

Han Qing’er’s heart ached. She was like a mortal in front of her second brother.

Han Huang smiled. “I’ll bring you out to travel the Chaos when I cultivate for another million years. No one in the Chaos can hurt you with me around. At that time, I’ll accompany you wherever you want to go!”

Han Qing’er immediately beamed. The sorrow in her heart vanished. She punched Han Huang’s chest and scolded him jokingly. “At least you have a conscience.”

Han Huang said, “Of course!”

Han Huang had liked to stick to Han Qing’er ever since he was young. The two of them had never left home, so their relationship was naturally not distant.

Han Huang chatted with Qingluan’er and Han Qing’er for a while before bidding farewell to visit his mother, Xing Hongxuan.

It was mainly to show off his gains.

However, Xing Hongxuan was indifferent, making him secretly angry. It was still his Third Mother who gave him face.

Eldest Mother was Xing Hongxuan, Second Mother was Xuan Qingjun, Third Mother was Qingluan’er, Fourth Mother was Li Yao, and Fifth Mother was Dao Comprehension Sword. This was a relationship that Han Jue later sorted out.

Han Huang made up his mind to visit Qingluan’er instead of Xing Hongxuan in the future.

He walked out of his mother’s Daoist temple and was about to return to cultivate when he suddenly looked up.

At this moment, countless sailboats were sailing over from outside the universe of stars. Every sailboat carried thousands of living beings with different postures. They looked like humans and demons.
