Chapter 966 Life of All, Silent Chaos

Son of the Ninth Chaos!

No wonder he could control the Chaotic Will!

Chaotic cultivation should mean that his cultivation level was on par with the Chaos.

With such a high level of hatred, it seemed that Han Jue had grasped his weakness.

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit was indeed afraid that all living beings would be slaughtered!

Han Jue snorted in his mind. He wasn’t in a hurry to continue speaking and waited for the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit to answer.

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit, who had transformed into the Chaotic Will, had an unseen expression, but from the hatred, his expression was definitely not good.

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit asked in a low voice, “Han Jue, it’s not impossible to restore everyone’s memories. However, you have to give in as well. Back then, the Dao Ancestor promised to restrict the future of the Heavenly Dao. Where’s your promise?”

Han Jue smiled. “My promise is not to use the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.”

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit was furious, but in order to maintain the coldness of the Chaotic Will, he did not show it.

Han Jue continued to wait.

After a long while…

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit suddenly emitted terrifying killing intent. It locked onto Han Jue and said, “Threatening the Chaotic Will won’t end well for you!

“Dao Destruction Mystical Power? That’s only a Heavenly Dao Mystical Power. How can it destroy all living beings in the Chaos?”

The Chaotic Will suddenly attacked. Han Jue felt endless darkness devouring him. Other than darkness, there was only the Chaotic Will in his eyes.

In an instant, the senses of Han Jue’s clone lost their effect. It was as if the entire Chaos had disappeared, leaving only him and the Chaotic Will. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He did not wait for death. He took out the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal and was about to attack when he suddenly looked up. He saw countless chains formed by lightning descending and quickly trapping him. His limbs were locked.

The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal collided with the chains.

The Chaotic Will appeared in front of him. Their eyes met and Han Jue saw a pair of extremely cold eyes that looked like snakes and humans. It made him feel as if he was in a cold cellar.

Han Jue broke free from the countless chains and used the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm. His right palm directly pierced through the Chaotic Will’s body as if nothing happened.

At this moment, an indescribable force exploded from Han Jue’s body, instantly tearing his body apart!

…

In the third Dao Field.

Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “Can the Dao Creator infiltrate my third Dao Field?”

Although he was already prepared, he still had to ask.

[No]

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

The living beings in the third Dao Field were all nurtured by him. There was no Chaotic Karma or providence at all. Xing Hongxuan had already passed a round of Absolute Purification and escaped the control of the Chaotic Karma and the Chaotic Will. Qingluan’er’s Heavenly Dao Karma was very shallow and she was sealed in the Primordial World by Han Jue. She wasn’t in the third Dao Field.

The current third Dao Field had no karma with the Chaos and the Heavenly Dao. It couldn’t be controlled by the Chaotic Will.

The third Dao Field’s array formation could resist a Creator Lord!

However, there was no Creator Lord in the current world!

Han Jue stood up. His eyes were cold as he quickly walked out of the third Dao Field.

He came in front of Ancestor Tian Xu and said, “Leave your soul fragment behind. I’ll send you out. After you leave, immediately use the Life of All. I want all the living beings in the Chaos to die!”

Ancestor Tian Xu immediately split a soul fragment without another word.

Han Jue waved his sleeve and sent him out.

Ancestor Tian Xu appeared in the Chaotic Void and immediately raised his hands to execute Life of All.

The Dharmic powers of a perfected Great Dao Supreme quickly changed, turning into a golden impact that rushed out of his body. It was like a golden circle that quickly expanded and swept through the Chaos!

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit appeared in front of him and said angrily, “How dare

you!”

With that, Ancestor Tian Xu’s body instantly exploded, leaving only a head.

Ancestor Tian Xu stared at the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit with a murderous gaze and did not say a word.

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit was infuriated.

The Divine Spirit tried to use the Chaotic Divine Authority to stop Life of All, but it couldn’t stop the power at all. It was as if two completely different powers could not touch each other.

Life of All was too fast!

In less than a breath of time, it swept through all living beings in the entire Chaos!

All the living beings in the world were reduced to ashes. Every living thing was affected.

It was not only the Chaotic lifeforms. The living beings of the Heavenly Dao were also reduced to ashes.

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit said angrily, “Crazy! Lunatic! Han Jue! You will definitely be doomed for eternity!”

He raised his hand and crushed Ancestor Tian Xu’s head. Then, he began to search for Han Juels aura.

Soon, he arrived at the universe of stars.

All the newly born living beings in the universe of stars were also destroyed. As for Liu Bei, he had long been taken back by Han

Jue.

As his clone, Liu Bei’s memories were not changed by the Chaotic Will.

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit went to the third Dao Field and attacked crazily, wanting to barge into it.

Unfortunately, the third Dao Field did not move no matter how he attacked.

The in-name disciples, Liu Bei, Ancestor Tian Xu, and Xing Hongxuan looked at the terrifying Nine-Headed Divine Spirit in panic.

Han Jue was very calm.

“Husband, could he…” Xing Hongxuan asked carefully.

Han Jue said, “I never do anything I’m not confident in. I’m just pretending to be crazy.”

He wanted to bet on a possibility!

Ninth Chaos!

If he gambled wrongly, at most, he would hide in the third Dao Field and cultivate until he reached the Creator Lord Realm before going out. At that time, the five Dao Creators wouldn’t be enough for him to crush with one hand!

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit’s Mystical Power rumbled extremely loudly and echoed throughout the entire Chaos. However, there were no longer any living beings in the Chaos. Even the Great Dao Divine Spirits had perished.

The Ultimate God of Punishment appeared and looked at the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit in shock.

“What is this?”

The Ultimate God of Punishment sighed.

At this moment, he also felt a few powerful auras. They were not weaker than him and didn’t participate in the battle against Han Jue.

“Indeed, there are still so many mighty figures hidden in the Chaos…”

The Ultimate God of Punishment thought to himself.

He looked up and noticed that the three thousand Great Dao began to shrink.

With the death of all living beings in the Chaos, the power of rules began to weaken. The Chaotic Space began to collapse.

It was returning to its initial state!

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit ignored the Ultimate God of Punishment and the worms lurking in the dark. He kept attacking and was extremely panicked.

“How is that possible! Why can’t I barge in?”

“Could it be the power of the Dao Creator?”

“Divine Might Heavenly Sage… anomaly… Could it be…”

The more the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit thought about it, the more panicked he became. Despair surged in his heart.

He had gambled wrongly. He thought that Han Jue was bluffing. He didn’t expect him to really be able to destroy all living beings!

The attack speed of the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit slowed down. Not long after, he stopped.

He trembled and knelt in the void. From the point of view of the Ultimate God of Punishment, he seemed to be kneeling in front of Han Jue’s Dao Field!

“This is…”

The Ultimate God of Punishment was shocked. The Chaotic Divine Authority had also bowed down to his Master?

However, that was not the case.

At this moment, a figure appeared in front of the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit. Even a powerful existence like the Ultimate God of Punishment couldn’t spy on it.

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit looked at the blurry figure in front of him and said with a trembling voice, “Father… I was wrong…”

Ninth Chaos!

The Ninth Chaos woke up with the destruction of all living beings in the Chaos!

Without receiving a reply from his father, the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit became even more nervous and began to beg for mercy.
