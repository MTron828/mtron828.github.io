Chapter 972 Double Great Creation, Immense Opportunity

Heavenly Court!

Han Jue and the Evil Heavenly Emperor drank and chatted in the imperial garden. Han Ling sat at the side obediently and silently, but she was not distracted. She listened carefully to their conversation.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at her and sighed. “Han Jue, your children are really talented. If not for the fact that Ling’er still has to cultivate with you, I would have poached her to the Heavenly Court to be an immortal.”

Han Jue smiled and said, “That depends on her own thoughts.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Han Ling replied, “Thank you for your kind intentions, Your Majesty. I plan to cultivate by Father’s side forever. I’m not interested in wandering the Chaos.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor raised his eyebrows and sized her up in surprise.

Han Jue was glad. This little girl was really

good.

He would be a little jealous if all his children were poached by the Evil Heavenly Emperor.

At this moment, Han Huang, Han Qing’er, and Jiang Jueshi rushed over.

The three of them quickly bowed when they saw Han Jue.

Han Jue smiled and introduced Han Ling to them.

“Sister!”

Han Qing’er was pleasantly surprised and immediately held Han Ling’s arm.

Han Huang also felt the closeness of his bloodline and immediately took out a Dharma treasure as a greeting gift.

However, Jiang Jueshi was slightly moved. He felt a familiar aura from Han Ling.

Great Creation!

This woman was also an Innate Great Creation!

Jiang Jueshi couldn’t help but look at Han Jue with reverence.

Master could already impart Great Creation to his children?

For some reason, he suddenly felt that his master was a little like the old master in his memories.

Perhaps he was thinking too much.

After all, millions of years had passed.

Han Jue asked Jiang Jueshi and the other two to sit down. Then, he asked about their cultivation.

“Father, I’m only a step away from the Great Dao Supreme Realm. I’ll definitely be able to attain it before the Chaotic Assembly. I want the Eternal Peak, but I might have to represent the Heavenly Court. In any case, you have countless disciples under you and I’m your son. It’s a win-win situation, but reputation is more important to the Heavenly Court.” Han Huang chuckled.

Han Jue smiled and nodded. He thought to himself that the Evil Heavenly Emperor was quite capable. He probably poured his heart out to Han Huang to make this rash kid care so much.

Han Qing’er curled her lips. “I just attained Freedom. I’m completely incomparable to Second Brother and Senior Brother Jiang. In the future, I might even be surpassed by Sister Ling’er.”

“Not bad.”

Han Jue nodded slightly and looked at his disciple.

Jiang Jueshi said, “My current cultivation is at the mid-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm. I don’t dare to think about the Eternal Peak anymore. Junior Huang is too powerful. However, I’m definitely one of the Chaotic Ten Absolutes.”

Han Ling stared at him in deep thought.

Han Jue smiled and said, “You and Ling’er are both born with Innate Great Creation. You have to cultivate well and not be caught up by Ling’er.” As expected.

Jiang Jueshi thought to himself.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s eyes lit up. “Innate Great Creation? Could it be that the mysterious prodigy the entire Chaos is talking about is Ling’er? Calculating the time, the two of them indeed descended at the same time.”

Han Huang couldn’t help but size up his sister again.

Han Qing’er’s eyes lit up. “Wow! Sister, you have a Great Creation like Senior Jiang? His Great Reincarnation Creation Technique is so abnormal. What Great Creation do you have?”

Han Ling looked at her father.

Han Jue said, “I can’t say for the time being. Ling’er will cultivate with me and show it one day.”

Jiang Jueshi asked curiously, “Then, will Junior Ling’er participate in this Chaotic Assembly?”

Han Jue shook his head.

Although Han Ling was curious about the Chaotic Assembly, this matter was completely left to her father, so she did not say anything.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor sighed. “Han Jue, oh Han Jue. It seems that your realm has already exceeded our imagination, so your children’s talent is becoming higher and higher.”

Everyone looked at Han Jue.

Han Jue smiled and said, “It’s alright. How’s the discussion about Huang’er’s marriage?”

Hearing this, Han Huang shuddered and said excitedly, “Father, I don’t want to marry! In my eyes, all living beings are not the same as me. How can I have improper relationships with them!”

Han Ling’s eyes lit up and she looked at him in surprise.

She had seen a lot along the way. She did not like the living beings of the Chaos and the Heavenly Dao. She even found it difficult to agree.

So she was not the only one. Second Brother was the same.

Han Jue showed a frown.

Han Qing’er hurriedly tried to persuade him. “Second Brother, when has Father ever asked you for anything? Others can’t wait to do it!”

Han Huang’s heart skipped a beat when he saw his father frown.

That’s right.

This was the only thing his father had told him to do.

Han Huang struggled for a moment and gritted his teeth. “Alright!”

Han Jue finally relaxed.

Just like that, Han Jue and his daughter stayed in the Heavenly Dao. Han Ling was pulled around by Han Qing’er. Han Huang and Jiang Jueshi entered seclusion again to prepare for the Chaotic Assembly.

Han Jue and the Evil Heavenly Emperor discussed the Dao. It was said to be a Dao discussion, but it was actually Han Jue’s suggestion. The Evil Heavenly Emperor happily accepted it.

The strongest guidance in the Chaos was hard to come by!

At the bottom of the Chaos, at a place with boundless mist.

Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, and Lao Dan cultivated around a small spring.

This small spring was less than five feet in diameter. Spring water surged out from the ground. The water surface surged slightly and mist rose from the edge. It looked no different from the spring water in the mortal world, but it was especially abrupt here.

was

There was no grass or life in a radius of ten thousand miles. There was only one water source.

Zhao Xuanyuan opened his eyes and said excitedly, “My cultivation level increased so quickly!”

Jiang Yi smiled and said, “Whose cultivation hasn’t? My Divine Yang Indestructible Body has increased greatly. Not only my cultivation level, but my potential is also increasing.”

Lao Dan opened his eyes and sighed. “It’s indeed impressive. A huge opportunity, a huge opportunity. However, it’s only enough for the four of us.”

“What? You still want to recommend it to the Three Pure Sacred World?”

“How is that possible! I have nothing to do with the Three Pure Sacred World. How many times have I said it!”

“Hehe. Then why are you so nervous when my master defeated Laozi?”

“After all, we are the same person. How can I not be worried?”

Zhao Xuanyuan and Lao Dan began to bicker habitually.

At this moment…

The water surface suddenly fluctuated and a figure appeared.

“Look!” Jiang Yi exclaimed. The other three immediately looked at the water.

The strange figure that appeared in the water was covered in white fur. It had a human-like upper body and arms like branches. Its white fur twisted with the water.

The four of them frowned. This was the first time they had seen such a phenomenon.

At this moment, the white-haired figure suddenly opened its eyes. A strange green light burst out, terrifying.

It opened its mouth, revealing two rows of sharp teeth like shark teeth, as if it was talking.

Dao Sovereign and the other three couldn’t understand or see through it.

Zhao Xuanyuan suddenly shivered and said, “Everyone, do you still remember the Ancient Desolate?”

Whoosh

The four of them jumped back at the same time, away from the small spring.

Jiang Yi swallowed. “Should we leave?” Dao Sovereign frowned. “Are you willing to give up such a treasure?” Zhao Xuanyuan covered his forehead. “Here we go again.” “Indeed.” Lao Dan sighed.

He knew that it was dangerous, but he still didn’t want to let go. This feeling was really uncomfortable.

Suddenly!

The white-furred figure actually crawled out of the spring. First, it was its arm, then its head. The hole formed by the spring was clearly far smaller than its body. It was stuck in the spring, quietly staring at Dao Sovereign and the other three.
