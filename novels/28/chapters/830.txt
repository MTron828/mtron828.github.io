Chapter 831 Pangu Protects the Heavenly Dao

The high and mighty Holy Mother of Order displayed the arrogance and disdain of a god looking down on all living beings. Below her, Pangu did not even look up. He was still swinging his saber at the cloud wall in front of him, determined not to stop.

“Pangu, no one can save you if you don’t stop!” the Holy Mother of Order said angrily.

At this moment, mighty figures appeared on her left and right, all glaring at Pangu below.

“I have already repaid the karma I owed the Great Dao Divine Spirits. However, the Divine Authority Generals are slaughtering the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. I will naturally resist!

“Today, I, Pangu, will definitely sever the Supreme Rule!

“This Chaos is not a chessboard for you to act recklessly!

“The Chaos doesn’t only belong to you. It also belongs to all living beings!”

Pangu roared angrily and raised his saber with both hands. His muscles tensed up and strong winds surrounded his body. His strength exploded.

The Great Dao Divine Spirits waved their palms at him. The majestic and huge Pangu also looked tiny in front of them.

Pangu waved his saber at the sky. Terrifying Dharmic powers erupted like a mountain torrent, scattering the Great Dao Divine Spirits that filled the sky.

The endless sea of clouds above Han Jue’s head was also slashed into an extremely vast gap, as if the sky was split into two.

Pangu continued to slash at the cloud wall in front of him. With every strike, his figure suddenly increased in height.

Han Jue had a strange expression.

......

Pangu and the Holy Mother of Order had a falling out?

Didn’t they help Pangu previously? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

It seemed to be because the Divine Authority Generals slaughtered the Chaotic Fiendcelestials?

But didn’t you do this before?

Han Jue suddenly couldn’t understand which side Pangu was on and why he was acting like this.

The illusion shattered.

Han Jue opened his eyes and fell into deep thought.

He was about to continue using the derivation function when a voice resounded in his mind.

“Today, I, Pangu, will revive the Chaotic Fiendcelestials I killed. I hope that the Chaotic Fiendcelestials will resist the Divine Authority Generals and no longer be a pawn of the Divine Spirits!

“Overturn the Great Dao Divine Spirit’s dominance and reestablish the Chaotic Order!

“The Chaos should be dominated by the Chaotic Fiendcelestials!”

They could still be revived?

Even Han Jue’s blood boiled.

However…

I’m not a Chaotic Fiendcelestial!

You called the wrong guy!

Han Jue smiled. He didn’t expect Pangu to rebel at this time and start a war with the Divine Authority Generals!

However, it was normal. The Divine Authority Generals should have gone after the Primordial Fiendcelestial, but they targeted the Chaotic Fiendcelestials along the way. As a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, what could Pangu do?

In that case, Pangu was only acting previously. On one hand, he wanted to become a Primordial Fiendcelestial, and on the other hand, he was confident in reviving the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.

What method was it to revive the Chaotic Fiendcelestials?

Han Jue was a little envious.

[Pangu sent you a dream. Do you accept?]

Han Jue looked at the notification that suddenly appeared in front of him and couldn’t help but be stunned.

Why was Pangu’s intention?

“Is it dangerous for me to accept his dream?”

[900 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[No]

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief and agreed to Pangu’s dream.

The dream was the illusion that Han Jue had entered previously. There were clouds everywhere.

Pangu stood in front and looked down at him.

Han Jue was like a tiny ant in front of him, and Pangu was a mountain, the highest mountain in the legends!

Pangu said, “Today, I’m not only opening an impossible path for the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, but also for you and the Heavenly Dao.”

Han Jue showed a frown.

“The Divine Authority Generals not only kill the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, but also the living beings of the Heavenly Dao. In other words, the Divine Authority Generals will destroy the Heavenly Dao. I need you to protect the Heavenly Dao. It doesn’t matter who is in charge of the Heavenly Dao. The living beings of the Heavenly Dao can live well as long as the Heavenly Dao survives!” Pangu stared at Han Jue with a burning gaze and said in a low voice.

I see.

Pangu’s true goal was the Heavenly Dao.

The entire Heavenly Dao was Pangu’s bloodline. He was fighting for his children and descendants.

Han Jue said, “I will do my best to protect the Heavenly Dao, but I can only do my best.”

Pangu smiled. “I’ve been observing you. You always say that it’s only for yourself, but you will stand up every time the Heavenly Dao is in trouble. This is also the reason why I didn’t pursue the matter when you subdued Pan Xin. You have contributed to the Heavenly Dao!”

Han Jue looked calm but felt awkward inside.

Actually, he was really doing this for himself!

At least, he felt that helping the Heavenly Dao was only within his ability.

“The Divine Authority Generals represent the Supreme Divine Authority. They are the strongest force in the Chaos. You can’t resist even if you see through the illusion. The Divine Authority Generals can erase true existences. The Chaotic Fiendcelestials can’t stop the Divine Authority Generals even if they join forces. I’ll try my best to stop them before they arrive at the Heavenly Dao.

“Of course, you might not be able to stop it! I hope you’re prepared! The Heavenly Dao lifeforms can’t escape the destruction of the Divine Authority Generals as long as they are in the Chaos!

“Unite with the Heavenly Dao and fight at any time. You have to try your best even if you die!” Pangu said with a burning gaze. With that said, the dream shattered.

Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.

He asked in his mind, “Is what Pangu said true?”

[900 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[It’s true.]

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

He suddenly began to admire Pangu. This guy was not as bad as he had imagined.

This Giant God was still very strong!

Without the Dao Field, he dared to start a battle against the Divine Authority Generals. He was very firm!

Although this Pangu was not the true Pangu himself!

“I wonder how many Fiendcelestials Pangu has revived. If they can stall for time, so be

it.”

Han Jue thought silently.

He suddenly felt that there was hope.

He was not alone!

Pangu would still support him if he destroyed ten thousand Divine Authority Generals!

It was still unknown how strong Pangu’s main body was.

Perhaps he could compete with the Chaotic Deities?

Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and told him the information Pangu had revealed.

As for how Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du arranged it, it was none of Han Jue’s business. In any case, the Heavenly Dao couldn’t help when resisting the Divine Authority Generals.

Han Jue glanced at Red Fate. She had only entered the Primordial Heavenly Prison for twenty thousand years and was still far from being subdued.

He did not continue cultivating but waited.

The heavenly might had yet to dissipate!

Pangu was still brandishing his saber!

Han Jue didn’t know what Pangu wanted to do. Could severing the Supreme Rule affect the Divine Authority Generals?

Perhaps.

Han Jue suddenly remembered that he didn’t understand the Divine Authority Generals.

Would the Divine Authority Generals be undying in the Great Dao?

Ten thousand undying Great Dao Sages…

Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat. Only then did he realize that he had underestimated the Divine Authority Generals.

He could only place his hopes on Pangu.

“Brother, work harder. Kill them. Let me harvest their heads in the end…” Han Jue muttered to himself, his eyes filled with anticipation.

On the other side, the Chaos was already surging!

All the Great Dao Divine Spirits rushed to the same place.

The Divine Robe Daoist was also one of them.

He traveled through the spatial turbulence and frowned.

“What is Pangu trying to do?”

The Divine Robe Daoist was puzzled and couldn’t help but slow down. He felt that this trip was very dangerous. It was better to slow down.
