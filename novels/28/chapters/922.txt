Chapter 924 First Lifeform of the Primordial World

“I can attain the Great Dao after opening this door!”

The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial’s eyes burned with a ferocious aura. Although it looked like a human, its figure emitted the hostility of a ferocious beast.

He came to the door of the Great Dao and placed his palms on it, then began to push with all his might. The Heavenly Constellation’s domineering power erupted, directly shaking the Great Dao Door.

“Oh? I didn’t expect a Connate Chaotic Fiendcelestial to be hidden in the Chaos!”

!!

A surprised voice sounded, causing the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial to frown.

He didn’t expect to be discovered by others when breaking through.

Could it be that this was not his consciousness but an independent breakthrough space?

“Fellow Daoist, this person is my good friend. Give me face!”

A voice came from the other side of the Great Dao Door. It was Han Huang.

The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial was moved upon hearing his voice. This kid has already attained the Great Dao?

“I see. I was just curious. Sorry to disturb

you.”

The mysterious voice smiled and disappeared.

The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial pushed the Great Dao Door with all his might. The door was completely opened dozens of breaths later. His Dharmic powers soared.

He quickly walked in and saw Han Huang looking at him in the darkness with a smile.

The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial asked, “What was that just now?”

Han Huang smiled. “It’s nothing. With me around, no one will hurt you.”

The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial understood immediately and cupped his fists. “Thank you!”

“Don’t thank me! Consolidate your cultivation first. We’ll talk later.”

“Alright!”

The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial closed his eyes and began to sense the power of the Great Dao.

Han Huang smiled.

He finally had an opponent!

He had already decided to fight thirty thousand rounds with the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial in the simulation trial!

Inside the Daoist temple.

Han Jue opened his eyes and a glint flashed across his red pupils.

A Chaotic Fiendcelestial was finally born in his Primordial World. He had already moved the Chaotic Fiendcelestial fused with the Creation Spirit Stone out of the Primordial World. This meant that this new Chaotic Fiendcelestial would be the Primordial World’s first Connate lifeform!

Life Fiendcelestial!

The Fiendcelestial representing vitality!

This was the key to the Primordial World transforming into reality!

The successfully nurtured Life Fiendcelestial curled up in a corner and instinctively absorbed the nebulous Primordial Qi. It had no intention of exploring for the time being.

The Life Fiendcelestial’s birth caused the Primordial World to expand several times again. Han Jue also felt the Great Dao of Life appear in the Primordial World and build the first rule for it.

The Primordial World would probably be completely perfected when the other Fiendcelestial Qi gave birth to living beings. At the same time, his cultivation would also increase exponentially.

Han Jue was in an extremely good mood.

He had found the right path of cultivation.

Would he become a Dao Creator when the Primordial World grew to the level of the Chaos?

Very likely!

The Ninth Chaos might be such a Dao Creator.

But what about the other four Dao Creators?

Could it be that they also had their own worlds?

This might be the reason why they did not pay attention to the Chaos.

Just like Han Jue, they wouldn’t care even if the Chaos was destroyed.

Han Jue felt that it was really possible.

As he guessed, he stared at the Life Fiendcelestial.

He could speed up the time in the Primordial World, but the Life Fiendcelestial was too powerful, causing his nebulous Primordial Qi to be insufficient. Therefore, he decided to make the time in the Primordial World equal to the Chaos.

Time could be controlled to speed up and slow down, but the energy was constant.

The speed at which the Primordial World produced nebulous Primordial Qi would not increase because of time.

Several days later.

Han Jue opened his eyes and started to check his emails.

[Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was enlightened by a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased greatly.]

(Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage was attacked by your enemy, Ancestor Tian Xu. He was severely injured.)

(Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage was attacked by your enemy, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. He was severely injured.)

(Your disciple Zhou Fan has fused seven Great Dao and comprehended a Great Dao Mystical Power. His providence has increased greatly.)

(Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil) x1098222

(Your good friend Jiang Yi was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil) x1100874

(Your good friend Lao Dan received a dream from a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased.]

[Your good friend Di Jiang was attacked by your enemy, Ancestor Tian Xu. He was severely injured.]

So many attacks and heavy injuries!

The entire circle of friends seemed to be participating in the crusade against the Ancient Desolate.

His circle of friends was already like this, let alone the Chaos.

The Ancient Desolate received too much hatred. In addition to the publicity of the Life faction and the Heavenly Dao, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit had already become a heinous demon. The various factions in the Chaos were afraid.

Han Jue raised his eyebrows when he saw an email.

(Your enemy, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, was attacked by a transcendent existence. The Ancient Desolate’s providence was severed.]

Transcendent existence! Who was that?

Han Jue asked in his mind.

(1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[Formless Transcendent Deity]

It was him!

Han Jue narrowed his eyes.

The Dao Creator attacked.

The meaning changed.

Han Jue asked in his mind, “Will the Dao Creator attack me if I kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit?”

(1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Continue!

[No]

Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

It seemed that the Dao Creator was still reasonable. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was too arrogant, which made the Dao Creator unhappy.

Han Jue shouldn’t be targeted by the Dao Creator as long as he didn’t show any ambition towards the Chaos.

Han Jue had such a mentality. The Chaos was vast. It was fine to give birth to geniuses and mighty figures. He couldn’t be bothered as long as it didn’t affect him.

“Why didn’t the Formless Transcendent Deity kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit?”

[It involves karma that cannot be deduced.]

Unable to deduce?

Dao Ancestor?

No, the Dao Ancestor might not be stronger than the Formless Transcendent Deity. Otherwise, he would not have to disappear.

Ninth Chaos!

It seemed that the Ninth Chaos’ restrictions on the Dao Creator exceeded Han Jue’s expectations.

Just as Han Jue was thinking, another uninvited guest came from outside the universe of stars.

This aura was very familiar!

Divine Lord Peacock!

Why was this fellow here?

Jiang Jueshi also sensed Divine Lord Peacock’s aura and immediately arrived outside the universe of stars to stop him.

Divine Lord Peacock stepped on the Five-colored Divine Light. His clothes were gorgeous and he looked imposing, like an immortal lord wandering the universe.

He sized up Jiang Jueshi and clicked his tongue in wonder. “I didn’t expect this universe to have a Great Dao Sage guarding

it.”

Jiang Jueshi frowned. “Fellow Daoist, please take a detour. This universe has just given birth to a spirit. It can’t withstand your pressure.”

“I’ve been traveling the Chaos for a long time and want to find a place to enter seclusion. Let’s do it here. Your aura is different from this universe. It’s clearly unrelated to you. You just came early. We won’t disturb each other. How about that?” Divine Lord Peacock raised his chin and said proudly.

He didn’t care about Jiang Jueshi at all.

Jiang Jueshi frowned even more. He raised his right palm and said, “Don’t blame me for being impolite if you insist on being stubborn.”

Divine Lord Peacock was amused. “You’ve only just attained the Great Dao, yet you dare to compete with me. Do you know who I am?”

Jiang Jueshi knew that things wouldn’t end well when he heard that. Thus, he immediately attacked.

Divine Might Great Heaven Palm!
