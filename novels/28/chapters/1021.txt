Chapter 1023 Finding the Fiendcelestial

It had been a long time, but Han Yunjin and Han Qing’er were still quite distant. Although Han Qing’er acted like they were close, Han Yunjin couldn’t help but wonder what it was.

The difference in cultivation between the siblings was great, so they rarely walked around.

Han Qing’er smiled and said, “I want to ask if there are any prodigies like Han Yao in the Han family. Your second brother wants to take in a disciple. He doesn’t have any children, so he can only find one from your knees.”

Han Yunjin was moved and looked happy.

He was a Heavenly Dao Sage, after all. He had traveled the Chaos and naturally knew Han Huang’s prestige. The current Han Huang could be considered a top mighty figure in the Chaos. He could cover the ages with one hand. His Mystical Power was unimaginable.

Han Yunjin said, “My Han family has many geniuses. Each generation is stronger than the last. Since Second Brother wants a disciple, I naturally have to choose the strongest one.”

Han Qing’er immediately beamed and covered her mouth. “Fifth Brother, don’t disappoint Third Sister. I promised Second Brother.”

Han Yunjin smiled and nodded. He immediately sent a voice transmission.

After making arrangements, Han Yunjin asked curiously, “Why does Second Brother suddenly want to take in a disciple?”

Han Qing’er spread her hands, indicating that she didn’t know.

Jiang Jueshi said, “Mighty figures have been thinking of ways to create their own world ever since the appearance of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World and the Transcendent Great Dao World. Junior Huang is no exception. He needs someone to guide all living beings in his world. This saves trouble.”

Han Yunjin was deep in thought. He had also heard of the Great Dao World, but in his opinion, it was only the largest world. He could also create a world, but it did not affect his cultivation level much. It was already tiring enough to manage the Han family, so he naturally couldn’t be bothered to create a world.

Han Qing’er snorted. “Second Brother is simply crazy. He has already reached the peak of history and is even a Divine Punisher. He dominates a Chaotic Domain. Fewer than five existences can match him in the Chaos. He’s actually still busy cultivating in seclusion. In another ten million years, perhaps the juniors will no longer remember him, just like Father. In this current world, how many living beings still remember the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?”

Jiang Jueshi smiled and did not refute or agree. The higher he stood, the more he knew about the depths of the Chaos.

Han Yunjin asked, “How is Father?”

“How would I know? He’s always in seclusion. Only Sister Ling’er can always be by his side,” Han Qing’er replied.

Han Yunjin fell into deep thought at the mention of Han Ling.

Not long after, a Sage of the Han family brought a handsome prodigy over.

Jiang Jueshi sized him up with a hint of disappointment in his eyes.

He also wanted to choose a prodigy to enter his world!

After five million years, the races in the mortal world changed. The Heavenly Dao and the sun and moon spun. The eras changed and the Chaos also changed day by day.

Han Jue opened his eyes and felt his Dharmic powers.

The Ultimate Origin World developed steadily. There was already a vast world. The Ultimate Origin Qi was endless and filled the world. The Spirit Qi was already far superior to the Chaos in terms of cultivation.

Han Jue first entered the simulation trial and challenged a hundred Formless Transcendent Deities.

He won easily!

Two hundred Formless Transcendent Deities!

An hour later, Han Jue had the upper hand.

He was satisfied. After all, they were Dao Creators. Every additional one was not simple.

In any case, he was not afraid of anyone other than the Ninth Chaos.

Han Jue recalled that the Ultimate God of Punishment had sent him a dream request tens of thousands of years ago, but he was busy in seclusion and ignored it.

He sent a dream to the Ultimate God of Punishment now.

The dream was the Chaotic Void.

The Ultimate God of Punishment immediately bowed when he saw him.

Han Jue smiled and asked, “The Chaos has been stable recently. The number of Great Dao Divine Spirits has increased greatly. The overlords and ancient giants all listen to you. Why are you visiting me in my dreams?”

The Ultimate God of Punishment smiled and said, “It’s all thanks to Master that I obtained Han Huang, like obtaining the Universal Divine Pillar. The current Chaos has indeed reached an unprecedented peace, but many strange things have happened recently. For example, the Great Dao have become spirits and the Supreme Rules have fluctuated. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Since ancient times, although there have been times when the Great Dao have become spirits, it has not been as frequent as in the past millions of years. Every time the Supreme Rules fluctuate, a race will be born in a corner of the Chaos. These races have potential that is not inferior to the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Furthermore, they all have different talents. They are solitary and warlike. I’m worried that they will become a source of uneasiness.”

Han Jue said, “Why don’t you eliminate them since you’re worried?”

The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “I indeed wanted to do that, but I was stopped by a mysterious force and had no choice but to stop. I suspect that I was stopped by the Lord of Chaos. However, the Lord of Chaos clearly conferred me the title of leader of the Divine Spirits after the Chaotic Assembly ended. Why didn’t he tell me bluntly if he wanted to protect those races?”

He hesitated but didn’t continue. Instead, he stared at him.

Han Jue said, “You’re right. Perhaps it’s not the Lord of Chaos.”

The Ultimate God of Punishment was moved.

Han Jue continued, “The next trend in the Chaos is the Primordial Fiendcelestial. He will stir up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Transcendent existences are all waiting for the Primordial Fiendcelestial to appear. What you have to do is find it and help it grow. You have to wait for the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity to arrive.”

The Ultimate God of Punishment asked in surprise, “Primordial Fiendcelestial? Isn’t that a legend? Besides, why will the Primordial Fiendcelestial harm the Chaos?”

“Creation after destruction. You just need to find it and let it develop.” Han Jue shook his head.

The Ultimate God of Punishment pondered in silence.

Han Jue didn’t point out that Han Huang was the Primordial Fiendcelestial. He wanted Han Huang to prove himself.

“I understand. Thank you for your guidance, Master!”

The Ultimate God of Punishment bowed respectfully.

The dream ended.

Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality. He opened his eyes and looked at the Chaos. Those old friends had already become leaders in all directions. They were so impressive and were no longer like when they fought back then.

Not bad.

Han Jue enjoyed his current life very much. He didn’t have to worry about the future.

He paid attention to the races that the Ultimate God of Punishment had mentioned. There were already dozens of them, all scattered at the edges of the Chaos. At first glance, they seemed to be developing from the edges inside.

These races were rather strange. They didn’t have bodies and their souls were shaped. They almost didn’t have the appearance of humans.

One had to know that the Human Race had the Connate Dao Body. It was a body that the Dao Ancestor studied Dao techniques and was the most suitable for cultivation and transformation. That was why Nüwa used it to create humans and why they were conferred the title of the protagonists of the Heavenly Dao.

Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to calculate these races. He couldn’t directly interfere even if it was a Dao Creator’s plot. Currently, everyone was minding their own business and was doing well. Wasn’t that what he wanted?

No one could cultivate faster than Han Jue as long as he was given time.

His gaze landed on the five, including Dao Sovereign. They were still in the Transcendent Great Dao World.

Now, the Transcendent Great Dao World had been completely exposed. It used to hide in the dark, but now, it looked like it was being devoured by the Chaos. Han Jue could see at a glance that the two worlds were fusing.

It was not only the Transcendent Great Dao World. The Consciousnessless Great Dao World was also fusing with the Chaos.

Han Ye was correct in following them. He had been killing all these years and had even raised living beings in the Great Dao World. When they became stronger and the various factions fought for supremacy, causing the people of an area to live in misery, he would especially come to kill them to become a killing star.
