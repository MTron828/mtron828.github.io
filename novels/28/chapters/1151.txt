Chapter 1152 Time Lord

The Fusang Divine Tree trembled upon seeing Han Jue appear. It said respectfully,

“Greetings, Master.”

The Divine Tree was equivalent to a clone. Its will was the same and it did not become an independent spirit. It was equivalent to the Fusang Tree multitasking.

Han Jue asked, “Can you establish a connection with the Origin Space-time?”

!!

Tens of millions of years ago, Han Jue had sent a voice transmission to the Fusang Divine Tree and instructed it on this mission.

The Fusang Divine Tree supervised space-time. How could it be worthy of being the God of Space-time if it couldn’t even maintain the Origin Space-time?

“I can’t find the Origin Space-time you mentioned, but recently, more and more cultivators have crossed space-time. Do you think we need to set up a space-time order? Perhaps I can sense the Origin Space-time more clearly after space-time stabilizes,” the Divine Tree replied with an ashamed tone. Han Jue said, “You will set the order of space-time. I will give you authority. Don’t ask me about anything. If you don’t do well, I will give the Divine Authority to another. If you don’t do it, you are also not qualified to sit in this position.”

The Fusang Divine Tree trembled and many leaves fell, decorating the pale void into universes. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I’ll work hard…”

The Fusang Divine Tree’s voice was quite weak, like a little girl.

Han Jue left without getting his answer.

He originally wanted to guide the Fusang Divine Tree, but he did not expect it to be so useless. Then forget it.

He would reward it after it achieved something.

Han Jue didn’t return to the third Dao Field. Instead, he came to the top of the blank

domain.

The Formless Transcendent Deity established the Transcendent Divine Hall here,

symbolizing his noble status. Han Jue also planned to create one, but he wanted to create a world instead.

He established a hidden domain above the Transcendent Divine Hall. No one sensed it. Even the Formless Transcendent Deity was none the wiser.

The difference between a Creator Lord and a Dao Creator was too great. As long as Han Jue didn’t want the Formless Transcendent Deity to discover it, it would be very difficult for him to sense it even if he stood in front of

him.

This method naturally used the basic rules of the blank domain.

Han Jue entered the domain he had created. It was dark red like the sky of purgatory.

He waved his right hand and looked at the

blue sky. Then, he paved an endless land

below.

The forest covered the ground. Clouds

gathered and rain poured down. It gathered in the valley of the mountain and formed a vast sea. A familiar environment appeared. At first glance, it looked like the mortal world.

Han Jue left a stone statue here that contained a trace of his will. If a fated person came to this world, they would obtain a huge opportunity.

Because this world was located above the Transcendent Divine Hall, it was very difficult to discover it.

Things in the world were ever-changing. The Formless Transcendent Deity might listen to Han Jue now, but not in the future. If one day, the Formless Transcendent Deity lost justice and happened to become a stubborn person, this world might become a variable to reverse

the situation.

Han Jue smiled in satisfaction and

disappeared.

Heavenly Dao, outside the 33rd Heaven, in the

Universal Hall.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at

someone in the hall with a helpless

expression.

“I really don’t know the opportunity of the

Lord. If you can’t find it, then go somewhere else,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said.

The person he was speaking to was Azure Heaven Mystic.

Azure Heaven Mystic was once a pawn

planted in the Heavenly Dao by the Chaotic Consciousness. His potential had once stunned the Heavenly Dao, but he fell silent after the Chaotic Consciousness attacked the Chaotic Assembly. All these years, he had been cultivating in seclusion. His cultivation level had already reached the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm. He had no choice but to

come to the Heavenly Dao because he couldn’t become a Dao Creator on his own.

Azure Heaven Mystic frowned and said, “In

that case,

let me stay in the Heavenly Dao.” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Of course, but don’t bully the juniors.” Azure Heaven Mystic’s personality was too arrogant. In the past, he had made countless enemies in the Heavenly Dao. He clearly rarely killed, but his mouth was foul and annoying.

“Hmph, I understand!”

Azure Heaven Mystic waved his hand and left.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du smiled bitterly.

Azure Heaven Mystic looked down at the

Immortal World after walking out of the Universal Hall, his brows still furrowed. “Strange, what did I forget…” Azure Heaven Mystic muttered to himself. He had not returned to the Heavenly Dao only to find the opportunity to become a Creator Lord. Unknowingly, a hint of discomfort appeared in his Dao heart. He felt that he had forgotten

something. At first, he did not care, but this

feeling lingered in his heart and would not go

away.

He couldn’t figure it out, so he decided to personally visit the Immortal World. There were many Great Dao Supremes hidden

in the current Immortal World. They were all here to find the Lord’s opportunity. Therefore, they left many inheritances in the

Immortal World and also planted a fortuitous encounter for countless future geniuses.

…

Dragon Court.

This world was surrounded by an extremely

majestic golden dragon. The power of the coiling dragon shook the blank domain, causing ordinary factions to not dare to provoke the Dragon Court.

A stone pavilion stood quietly above the sea of

clouds. In the pavilion was a youth in silk blue clothes. His facial features were exquisite and his long hair was tied up under a crown. had sharp eyebrows and bright eyes, like a young immortal who had walked out of a

painting.

He

Han Liang opened his eyes and looked at his hands, frowning.

“What’s missing…” Han Liang muttered to

himself. The more he thought about it, the more frustrated he became. He grabbed his head, causing his crown to tilt. “You don’t recognize your instincts.”

A voice sounded and a figure appeared in

front of him.

Han Liang frowned and slowly stood up. He asked coldly, “Who are you?”

He had been in the Dragon Court for some

time. He was the strongest person here. Even Long Hao was not his match. However, he sensed danger from the aura in front of him.

The figure replied, “You can call me the Time Lord.”

“Oh? You call yourself the Lord? You’re really

arrogant!” Han Liang said coldly. The sky outside the courtyard changed color. He used his Dharmic powers to seal the sky to prevent

accidentally injuring the living beings of the Dragon Court.

The Time Lord chuckled. “It’s useless. You can’t hurt me.”

Han Liang suddenly attacked. The stone

pavilion exploded and the sea of clouds churned.

However, his Dharmic powers couldn’t do

anything to the Time Lord. He was like a shadow.

Han Liang flashed in front of the Time Lord

and reached out to grab him. However, his hand passed through the latter. Han Liang’s pupils constricted. He immediately used a soul attack, but it was still useless.

He couldn’t hurt the Time Lord no matter

what method he used.

It was as if he was hallucinating. As if the

Time Lord did not exist.

Han Liang stopped and asked in a low voice, “Who are you?” The Time Lord replied, “I am time, and time is me. When the world has the definition of

time, there will be me. I am here to lead you

on your mission.

“Han Liang, you are a Fiendcelestial of the Endless Era. Your potential is countless times stronger than the Chaotic Fiendcelestial and the Primordial Fiendcelestial. You should be the Endless Fiendcelestial. Your duty is to create a greater domain for other existences, not work for others and compete with them.”
