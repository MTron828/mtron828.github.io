Chapter 885 Breakthrough to the Mid-Stage, Fighting 25,000 Foolish Sword Sages

“Prepare for battle!” Han Tuo said in a low voice. He raised his right hand and a terrifying black shadow condensed on his body, as if Han Jue was using the Grand Unity Aspect.

The other four Divine Punishers were also prepared to fight.

Their gazes landed on the huge stone tablet in front of them. Figures were surging from the countless caves. More and more appeared, as if it was an ant nest or a race was hidden

inside.

At this moment, blood words appeared on the surface of the stone tablet and interwove between the various holes. They were dense and made one’s scalp tingle.

“Chaotic Fiendcelestial… Very good, you suit me very well!” a cold voice sounded. The language was strange, but the Five Great Divine Punishers were strong and could understand what he meant.

Han Tuo raised his eyebrows and shouted, “Kill this thing!”

The Five Great Divine Punishers attacked together. Dharmic powers shook the void. Five divine lights of different colors collided with the huge stone tablet and emitted a dazzling light that swept in all directions, causing the void to lose all color.

In the third Dao Field.

Han Jue focused on cultivating. The Primordial World in the depths of his soul continued to expand. His Supreme Powers strengthened and his understanding of the power of creation deepened.

Han Jue was in his 70,000th year of seclusion when he finally welcomed the opportunity to break through.

He began to break through.

He successfully broke through five thousand years later!

Mid-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm!

Han Jue smiled. He finally broke through.

He checked the emails.

(Name: Han Jue] (Lifespan: 5,425,122 | 90,039,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,9 99,999,999,999,999)

[Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]

(Cultivation: Mid-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm (Perfect Sage)]

[Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]

[Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]

His lifespan had increased by nine times!

Han Jue was in a good mood.

It was a surprise as usual. Who would mind living longer?

Han Jue began to consolidate his cultivation.

Three thousand years later.

His cultivation finally stabilized. He began to improve his Mystical Power next.

Five hundred years later.

Han Jue learned five hundred new Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. He had 2,449 now.

He was already very close to the three thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.

However, there was still no Dao of Creation among these Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.

Han Jue opened his eyes and started the simulation trial.

It was still the Foolish Sword Sage.

The Foolish Sword Sage of the Great Dao Supreme Realm was still stronger than the Divine Authority Generals. He was very suitable as a template.

Han Jue challenged ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages in one go.

Instant kill!

As expected, Han Jue’s combat strength would increase greatly every time he broke through a minor realm.

How terrifying was that when 2,449 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols fused together? They crushed everything in their path and directly killed ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages.

Han Jue continued to challenge.

Twenty thousand Foolish Sword Sages!

Han Jue found it difficult this time.

He didn’t win even after fighting for an hour.

He was not discouraged. Instead, he was excited.

Only with difficulties could one have fighting spirit.

Several days later.

Han Jue opened his eyes and was satisfied.

His limit was 25,000 Foolish Sword Sages. It was already very terrifying.

After all, the Foolish Sword Sage was also a Great Dao Supreme!

The Chaos would collapse if such a battle really happened!

The current Chaos could not withstand so many Great Dao Supremacies.

Han Jue wanted to curse the enemy to celebrate, but he suddenly didn’t know who to

curse.

The enemies were either dead or hiding. No one dared to provoke him on the surface.

Han Jue felt inexplicably regretful.

He was afraid of having too many enemies in the past, but now, he hoped that there would be too many.

He couldn’t use his Mystical Powers without an enemy. “Looks like my Dao heart still needs refinement,” Han Jue muttered to himself with firm eyes.

He thought about Ninth Chaos, about the Chaotic Consciousness, and then about the Formless Transcendent Deity. He still had a long way to go.

Han Jue checked the emails.

The recent circle of friends was not peaceful anymore. It was mainly Han Tuo, Dao Sovereign, and Huang Zuntian.

Han Jue suddenly noticed that the Evil Heavenly Emperor and Ancestor Xitian had been very well-behaved recently, as if they had disappeared.

These two leaders were both ambitious and must be plotting something.

Han Jue called Han Qing’er in after reading the emails for a while.

Han Qing’er was stuck at the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm and could not attain the Dao.

It was mainly because she had little experience and her Dao heart was unstable. She didn’t find her own Dao.

Han Qing’er looked depressed after entering the temple. “Father, am I not talented?”

She thought that her father wanted to scold her about cultivation.

After all, she had not broken through in so many years. She was angry.

Back then, she had said that she wanted to surpass her brother. Now, it seemed that she had been thinking too much.

What was potential below the Sage Realm? She even wondered if she should go out and seek opportunities.

Han Jue smiled. “Your potential is already good enough. I’ll help you attain the Dao.”

“Really?”

Han Qing’er was pleasantly surprised.

Han Jue said, “You just haven’t found your own Dao, but you can cultivate mine. My Dao contains the truths of the three thousand Great Dao. Any Dao is compatible with it.”

Han Qing’er looked at him in admiration upon hearing this.

She pounced into his arms and started to act spoiled.

Han Jue pushed her away helplessly and said, “A woman can’t be too close to her father when she grows up. Do you understand? You’re no longer a child. You can’t be like this in the future. It looks inappropriate.”

Han Qing’er giggled. “What? I’ll always be your daughter.”

Han Jue shook his head and laughed. Then, he began to preach the Dao. Han Qing’er immediately entered a state of Dao comprehension once his Dao voice sounded.

A hundred years of preaching passed in a flash.

Han Qing’er opened her eyes and exclaimed, “What a powerful Dao. Father, what Dao is this?”

“Great Dao of Extreme Origin.”

“I see many figures walking on this Great Dao’s path. Who are they?”

“My disciples. They also cultivate this Dao. Those before you are all stronger than you.”

“So many?”

Han Qing’er was shocked. At that time, she stood on the Great Dao of Extreme Origin and looked forward. She couldn’t see the end, but she could see many figures. The distance between them was greater than the Dao Pursuer behind her.

She asked curiously, “Who’s the strongest among your disciples?”

Han Jue pondered for a moment and said, “Murong Qi, my grand-disciple.”

Murong Qi had always remained in the first tier of the second Dao Field after becoming a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. His cultivation had already reached the late stage of the Freedom Sage Realm. After him were the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, the crimson fox, and the others. Dao Sovereign and the other two were all left behind by a minor realm.

Murong Qi?

Han Qing’er had never heard of this name. She had thought that it was Jiang Jieshi, but she didn’t expect that the terrifying Jiang Jieshi could not be ranked first.

“Where’s Jiang Jueshi?”

“Him? He’s not in the top ten. His cultivation level has not increased all these years. He’s still exploring his own Dao creation.”

Han Jue smiled. He was telling the truth.

Jiang Jueshi had broken through too quickly in this life and needed to settle down. Otherwise, his foundation would be unstable. Han Jue would personally teach him after some time.

A black vortex appeared behind Han Jue.

Han Qing’er widened her eyes and was about to ask what this was when Han Jue stood up and struck out with his palm. A hand that had just emerged from the black vortex was slapped away by him.

Han Jue sensed carefully. The one who used the Invocation Technique was Han Tuo, but he was chased by the enemy as soon as he used it.

It seemed that this kid’s enemy was not simple!
