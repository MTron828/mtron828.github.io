Chapter 822 Ancient Soul Bead, Killing All Living Beings in the Chaos

Han Jue thought of Ancestor Xitian. This old fellow’s true strength was even more terrifying than his appearance.

Be careful.

In any case, he had a long lifespan and was not afraid of wasting it.

Han Jue chose to continue.

[Yes, but there is also a possibility of failure.)

Han Jue showed a frown.

How could he fail?

Could it be related to the other party’s Supreme Treasure?

Han Jue couldn’t use the simulation trial without detecting Dao God Qing Xiao first.

He sighed. He could only take out the Book of Misfortune.

In any case, Dao God Qing Xiao only attacked the Divine Robe Daoist. The outside world thought that the Divine Robe Daoist and Han Jue were enemies.

Without another word, he started cursing Dao God Qing Xiao.

Previously, he already knew Dao God Qing Xiao’s appearance from the Divine Robe Daoist. Coupled with his cultivation and name, he could accurately capture it in karma.

......

He cursed with all his might.

Five days later.

Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease.

However, the curse stopped just as ten million years of his lifespan were deducted.

He missed.

Eh?

Han Jue raised his eyebrows and asked in his mind, “How did Dao God Qing Xiao escape my

curse?”

(1 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

So expensive!

Continue!

[Ancient Soul Bead: Ultimate Dao Treasure, Avoid Karma, Avoid Providence, Soul Absorption, can freely travel through the past.]

Ultimate Dao Treasure!

This was the first time Han Jue saw someone with an Ultimate Dao Treasure.

No wonder this fellow was so arrogant. The Divine Robe Daoist was suppressed until he couldn’t fight back.

In that case, he could only wait for Dao God Qing Xiao to personally visit him.

At that time, he could let Great Sage Void Soul block for a period of time. He would use the simulation trial to find a way to insta-kill him before fighting. Han Jue dispersed the uneasiness in his heart and continued cultivating.

…

In the quiet void, Dao God Qing Xiao brought dozens of followers here. No one said anything. It was very silent.

Suddenly!

Dao God Qing Xiao stopped, and so did his followers.

Two figures appeared in front of him. One of them was Huang Zuntian. He was slightly behind, and in front of him was a black-robed man. His figure was like flames and his true appearance could not be seen.

Dao God Qing Xiao asked, “What do you mean?”

The black-robed man said softly, “You defeated the Divine Robe Daoist. Your strength is not bad. Join me.”

Dao God Qing Xiao frowned. “Then, who are

you?”

Without another word, the black-robed man waved his sleeve and attacked. The moment he raised his hand, endless black wind swept out and drowned Dao God Qing Xiao and the others.

Huang Zuntian silently retreated. The other party could easily severely injure a Great Dao Divine Spirit. He was definitely not an ordinary person.

In the blink of an eye, another fifty thousand years passed. Han Jue opened his eyes and stretched.

Dao God Qing Xiao had yet to come to the Heavenly Dao after so many years.

Had he changed his mind?

It was very likely. After all, this fellow had found trouble with him mainly to become famous. He was already famous now.

Han Jue started to check his emails.

No information was worth Han Jue’s special attention in the past fifty thousand years. They were all not bad. The only things that interested him were probably Han Tuo and Yi Tian officially becoming Great Dao Divine Spirits.

Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan was still something.

Han Jue originally thought that this fellow would fight wantonly like the Heavenly Court and Life, but that was not the case. Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan kept a low profile and conserved his strength.

This fellow would stir up the entire Chaos one day!

Han Jue began to hesitate. Should he visit Han Tuo in his dreams and comfort him?

At this moment… “I am the leader of the Great Dao Divine Spirits. From today onwards, all those who have attained the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit will hunt down Life together. I will obtain the providence of the Great Dao and completely eliminate Life in a million years!”

A dignified voice interrupted Han Jue’s thoughts.

The Great Dao Divine Spirits’ leader? Who was that?

These words were only targeted at those above the Sage Realm?

Tsk tsk, the commotion was big enough. He wondered if it could be called out.

Anyway, Han Jue wouldn’t make a move.

However, he was worried for Ancestor Xitian, Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, and Huang Zuntian.

Han Jue asked in his mind, “Can the Great Dao Divine Spirits’ leader give the order to eliminate Life?”

[900 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

(No]

Indeed.

Han Jue shook his head.

It was not a coincidence that the First Life Black Sovereign could survive from the beginning of the Chaos until today. He needed a stronger force if he wanted to eliminate his force.

[Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]

Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

It had been a long time since this fellow visited him in his dreams. He probably had something important to say.

Han Jue chose to accept it.

In the dream, Qiu Xilai was the first to speak, “Master, someone is investigating the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.”

Han Jue asked, “In the Heavenly Dao?”

Now that the Heavenly Dao was flourishing, Han Jue and the Sages would vomit blood if someone used the Dao Destruction Mystical Power to cleanse it.

“No, it’s the Chaos. I’m currently in the Chaos. Not long ago, I encountered a mysterious existence who asked if I knew the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.”

“What did you say?”

“I naturally denied it. Although he didn’t pester me, I’m still a little worried. I’m afraid that this is a danger to the Heavenly Dao. The Dao Destruction Mystical Power is only targeted at the Heavenly Dao lifeforms.”

“I understand. I’ll be careful. Be careful not to be targeted.” “Understood.”

The dream also ended after the conversation ended.

Han Jue immediately deduced, but he couldn’t deduce it himself. This meant that the other party was stronger than him or had a Supreme Treasure with the power to block deductions.

“I want to know who asked Qiu Xilai about the Dao Destruction Mystical Power?”

(700 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind.

First Life Black Sovereign!

It was him!

Han Jue frowned and asked in his mind, “Why is the First Life Black Sovereign asking about the Dao Destruction Mystical Power?”

(700 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Continue!

There was no illusion. A line of words appeared in front of him.

(He wants to develop a Mystical Power that can kill all living beings in the Chaos.]

In other words, this matter did not involve other karma. It was all thought by the First Life Black Sovereign, so it did not derive the scene at that time.

Could it be that this fellow was forced by the Great Dao Divine Spirit?

No!

Perhaps his thought infuriated the Great Dao Divine Spirits.

However, he was sensed by them for some reason.

Han Jue fell into deep thought.

The First Life Black Sovereign was so crazy. Should he just kill him in one go?

He didn’t want his disciples to die.

In the past, Han Jue wanted to use the First Life Black Sovereign to restrain the Great Dao Divine Spirits and the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Now, something had happened.

“How long will it take for the First Life Black Sovereign to develop a Mystical Power that can destroy all living beings in the Chaos?”

(700 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[About 300 million years.]

This number seemed long, but it was much faster than the incoming Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.

It seemed that the First Life Black Sovereign was also attempting to change the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.

They might be able to kill the nurtured Primordial Fiendcelestial in advance if all the living beings of the Chaos were killed.

Then, he would wait a little longer.

Han Jue wanted to wait until both Life and the Great Dao Divine Spirits were injured before taking out the First Life Black Sovereign without anyone knowing.

Life would be leaderless if he cursed the First Life Black Sovereign to death now. Li Daokong and the others would suffer.

Could this fellow also find a Supreme Treasure to avoid the curse in the future?

Han Jue frowned again.

He couldn’t wait.

He should strangle him to death as soon as possible!

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing.
