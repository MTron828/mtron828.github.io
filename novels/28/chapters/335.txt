Chapter 336 Zenith Heaven’s Killing Intent, Jiang Yi’s Cry For Help

The black shadow raised his hand and continued to deduce with his fingers.

But after calculating for a while, he still did not notice anything unusual.

His divine sense swept through the Yellow Spring. Apart from wandering vengeful spirits, he couldn’t find his target.

He sighed and disappeared.

On the other side, Han Jue was busy preaching and neglected the outside world. It was almost impossible for anyone below the Zenith Heaven Realm to discover the Dao Field, so he didn’t have to check his surroundings at all times.

A year later.

Han Jue said, “Next, all of you have to maintain the spirit of cultivating diligently and not be lazy. Although I used a great Mystical Power to conceal the heavenly secrets on this island, there will definitely be stronger enemies in the future and even more dangerous tribulations. All of you have to cultivate well. In the future, we will fight against enemies together. I hope that one day, I can ascend to the Great Dao with all of you!”

Ascend to the Great Dao!

These words made everyone’s blood boil.

They might not believe what others said, but when it came from Han Jue, they were full of confidence.

Han Jue’s potential was already ridiculously strong. Following him, they had almost never suffered.

Instead, after leaving Han Jue, they often encountered misfortune.

Han Jue stood up and left. At the same time, he pulled Lu Huaxu into the simulation trial.

After so many years, Lu Huaxu had already given in and thought of himself as a member of the Hidden Sect.

Han Jue didn’t care about his previous life and only cared about the present.

If the Purple Star Emperor could join the Hidden Sect in the future, that would also be a good thing

After returning to the cave abode, Han Jue cultivated as he probed his consciousness into the Primordial World and observed the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.

Under the soaking of the nebulous Primordial Qi, only a small portion of the lotus turned purple.

At this rate, it would take a long time for him to completely master the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.

If it was fast, it would take hundreds of years. If it was slow, it would take a thousand years.

Han Jue could only hope that his cultivation breakthrough would increase his mastery of the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.

Time passed. Even though the myriad worlds had already welcomed the Immeasurable Calamity, time continued to pass. The negative karma of the Immortal World began to spread to the thousands of mortal worlds. More and more immortals fled the Immortal World, spreading the chaos.

Han Jue didn’t disturb the Heavenly Emperor anymore. He usually checked the situation through emails.

Thirty years later.

Han Jue was cursing the Demon Emperor when he suddenly saw an email.

(Because of your curse, the Demon Emperor’s Zenith Heaven Dao Fruit has begun to be infected by killing intent.]

Han Jue clicked his tongue in wonder.

You’re really the craziest one!

Han Jue wouldn’t show mercy to the Demon Emperor. Six-star hatred was already irreconcilable.

Speaking of which, other than in the Great Ultimate Hall, Han Jue had never met the Demon Emperor or even spoken with him. If there was anyone to blame, it would be his useless son, Crown Prince Tianze. Crown Prince Tianze found trouble with him. Han Jue had killed him and offended his mother, the Nine-tailed Demon Empress. The hatred was too high, so Han Jue had no choice but to kill the Nine-tailed Demon Empress and then offend the Demon Emperor.

When would this cycle of vengeance stop?

Anyway, Han Jue wouldn’t stop. It would only end with the enemy bowing down!

Han Jue didn’t think too much and continued reading the emails.

Half a year later.

Han Jue felt something and took out the Golden Crow Token.

So it was Jiang Yi who wanted to contact him. Han Jue probed the Golden Crow Token with his divine sense and asked, “What is it?”

Jiang Yi said, “Can you save me?”

“No.”

The two of them grew silent.

Han Jue thought of Jiang Yi’s feelings for him and couldn’t help but ask, “Who caught you? Why are you like Dao Sovereign?”

Jiang Yi asked in surprise, “You know Dao Sovereign?”

“Yes, he also asked me for help. I could only ask the Heavenly Emperor to save him. He has already joined the Heavenly Court. Are you also willing to join?”

Jiang Yi fell silent again.

He was extremely embarrassed.

Back then, he tried his best to invite Han Jue to leave the Immortal World with him. After Han Jue rejected him, he still despised him.

Now…

Jiang Yi coughed and said, “I’m not captured. I’m just trapped. This is a mysterious forbidden land. I can’t escape and can only seek help.”

Han Jue asked in surprise, “If you can contact me, why can’t you contact the Golden Crow Divine Clan?”

“The token I gave you is a top-notch communication Dharma treasure. This pair of tokens can only send messages to each other. The other tokens are too low-grade. I can’t contact the Golden Crow Divine Clan.”

“Oh, where are you?”

“I’m in the Dark Sinking Great Swamp in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.”

“I’ll get someone to help you contact the Golden Crow Divine Clan. It’s impossible for me to save you. I’m so weak. I’ll die if I go.”

“Thank you…”

Jiang Yi wanted to scold Han Jue, but he didn’t have the face to.

Han Jue didn’t owe him anything.

After severing his divine sense, Han Jue took out the Heavenly Dao Token and contacted the Heavenly Emperor, hoping that he could help inform the Golden Crow Divine Clan.

The Heavenly Emperor agreed readily. He didn’t seem curious about Han Jue and Jiang Yi’s relationship.

That made sense. The reason why Jiang Yi could often come to the mortal world under the Heavenly Court was definitely related to the Heavenly Emperor.

Han Jue put down the Heavenly Dao Token and said, “I’ve already done all I can. Hope for the best.”

Then, he shook his head.

He couldn’t understand Jiang Yi’s thoughts.

He was clearly the strongest prodigy of the Golden Crow Divine Clan, but he still ran around. Couldn’t he cultivate in seclusion in peace? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

So far, Jiang Yi’s cultivation level had only reached the Rank Two Immortal Emperor Realm.

After breaking through to the Emperor Realm, he had been wandering around, causing Han Jue’s cultivation to far exceed his.

The correct path to the Great Dao was cultivation!

Han Jue warned himself not to forget his true nature. Otherwise, Jiang Yi, Ji Xianshen, and the others would be his fate.

The strongest talent was not necessarily the strongest expert!

In the Sword Dao River.

Liu Bei, who was cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes. He was shocked to find someone beside him.

He hurriedly stood up and asked in a low voice, “Who are you?”

If Han Jue was here, he would definitely be pleasantly surprised.

It was actually the previous guardian of the Sword Dao River, Zhang Guxing! Zhang Guxing sized him up and asked, “Where’s Han Jue? You have his aura. You should be a clone, right?”

Liu Bei became even more nervous. “Senior, who are you?”

“Zhang Guxing. Tell him my name, he’ll come and see me,” Zhang Guxing said expressionlessly.

Liu Bei immediately used his telepathy to inform Han Jue.

When Han Jue learned that Zhang Guxing had returned, he was first surprised, then wary.

After being abducted for so many years, had his brother changed?

No, he couldn’t go without any preparations.

Han Jue left a wisp of his soul in the cave abode. If his main body was killed, he could still revive.

After doing all of this, he jumped into the Sword Dao River. Zhang Guxing had already recovered his body. He wore black and had a cold expression. His entire body emitted a powerful pressure. Seeing Han Jue, he smiled. Han Jue also smiled.

Zhang Guxing sighed. “You have indeed stepped into the Emperor Realm. I still underestimated you.” Han Jue smiled and asked, “Brother, how did you escape?” Zhang Guxing shook his head and said, “I didn’t escape. I’ve regained my position in the Divine Palace. While I’m cultivating, I came here to visit you and bring you a fortuitous encounter.” Fortuitous encounter?

Han Jue smiled, but his heart tightened.

There was indeed a problem!
