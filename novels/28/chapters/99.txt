Chapter 102: Seventh Level of the Body Integration Realm, Tragic Situation

“Tribulation Transcendence Realm… Such a great demon is definitely a disaster for us humans. I wonder if Yang Tiandong can escape. Sigh.”

Mo Fuchou sighed. The thought of Great Sage Green Python’s terrifyingness made him shiver.

He didn’t want to face him again.

“Look, it’s very dangerous outside. Brother Mo, why don’t you stay in the Jade Pure Sect in the future?” Han Jue said meaningfully.

Mo Fuchou did not immediately refuse. Instead, he sighed.

His Dao heart had indeed wavered.

Although most of the Mo family’s enemies had been eliminated and the remaining forces did not dare to cause trouble for them, he and Zhou Fan were both fiendish cultivators. It wasn’t appropriate for them to stay in the Jade Pure Sect.

Xuan Shishi stared at Han Jue and asked with a smile, “Does Fellow Daoist Han have a Dao Companion?”

Han Jue nodded and asked, “Why do you ask?”

He didn’t mention the relationship between Xuan Shishi and Xuan Qingjun.

He was still wary of Xuan Qingjun.

What if she was up to something?

“Nothing.” Xuan Shishi shook her head and smiled. She didn’t intend to reveal her connection with Xuan Qingjun.

Xuan Qingjun said that Han Jue didn’t know her true identity.

The two of them did not disturb him for long. After chatting for a while, they left.

From the beginning to the end, Xuan Shishi didn’t develop any favorability toward Han Jue.

As soon as they left the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain, Han Jue immediately entered the simulation trial and fought with her.

At the sixth level of the Body Integration Realm, Han Jue fought against Xuan Shishi, who was at the ninth level of the Body Integration Realm!

Instant kill!

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

After defeating such a weak Xuan Shishi, it seemed that Great Sage Green Python might not be that strong.

If it were him, Xuan Shishi wouldn’t have been able to save Mo Fuchou and Zhou Fan from him.

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Great Sage Green Python.

He had never seen the python before, so he could only curse using the name, and the actual effectiveness was unknown.

…

West Abyss, Nine Dragons Sect.

Huang Zuntian returned to his palace. When the door closed, he let out a long sigh.

“I’m finally back… I can’t go out anymore, and I can’t save just anyone…”

Huang Zuntian smiled bitterly. Recalling what had happened, he couldn’t help but tremble.

A few years ago, a large sect invited all the sect masters in the world to discuss the Dao together and build a good relationship. Huang Zuntian and the True Martial Sect’s Sword Elder, Shangguan Qiujian, went.

While the Sect Masters were discussing the Dao in the deep mountains, they happened to encounter Great Sage Green Python pursuing Yang Tiandong.

Huang Zuntian knew Yang Tiandong. After all, he used to be the sect master of the Raincoat Sect. Therefore, he saved him. As a result, he incurred Great Sage Green Python’s wrath. Even with all the sect masters working together, they were still no match for him.

Great Sage Green Python was too powerful!

If not for the fact that there was a powerful cultivator nearby, Great Sage Green Python might have killed all of them.

Huang Zuntian couldn’t help but think of Han Jue. Would that senior be able to defeat him?

Immediately, Huang Zuntian started healing.

Unfortunately, things never went as planned.

Great Sage Green Python had defeated more than ten demon kings and his prestige had soared. More and more demons joined his ranks. In his fury, he began to take revenge on the demon king who had attacked him. The demon king had been killed by him and his subordinates had to submit or die!

In the short span of a few years, Great Sage Green Python’s power had skyrocketed. He had begun to advance toward the human race. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He used the excuse of chasing after Yang Tiandong to attack the human territory.

Yang Tiandong was once half-human half-demon. Great Sage Green Python had claimed that Yang Tiandong had already transformed into a human. If he did not take revenge, he would not be a Great Sage of the demon race.

For a time, the humans of the various provinces panicked.

…

As tall as a small mountain, Great Sage Green Python sat halfway up the mountain. At the foot of the mountain, a huge pot was boiling with soup. One could vaguely see bones inside. Not far away, hundreds of mortals were sitting on the ground, trembling. There were demons everywhere.

Many of them were gnawing on human bodies. The scene was extremely cruel and bloody. It was like purgatory.

Great Sage Green Python frowned as he hissed. “Strange…”

Recently, he had felt the power of a curse disrupting him. Even wearing a Numinous Treasure couldn’t completely negate the effect.

If not for his extraordinary foundation and the Numinous Treasure, he might have been seriously injured by the mysterious curse.

It seemed like it was time to break through to the Tribulation Transcendence Realm!

At this moment, an eagle demon flew over and said, “Your Majesty, Yang Tiandong has already fled into the Guyuan State. Do you still want to pursue him?”

Great Sage Green Python’s expression darkened and it harrumphed. “Of course! Even if he flees to the ends of the world I’ll still hunt him down! I’ll slaughter any sect or city that dares to take him in. If I don’t kill him, I won’t be able to quell the hatred in my heart!”

“Yes!”

The eagle demon quickly turned around and left.

Thinking of Yang Tiandong made the Great Sage Green Python furious. He was already very tolerant of him, but this fellow actually dared to collude with other demon kings to attack him!

Ridiculous!

Absurd!

Great Sage Green Python had made up his mind to pursue Yang Tiandong to the end. Along the way, he would slaughter as he pleased and feed on the humans. If any major sects in the cultivation world asked, he would use Yang Tiandong as an excuse.

Great Sage Green Python was indeed furious, but he did not lose his mind. His true goal was to expand his influence!

“I’ll find a place to transcend the tribulation first. Once I reach the Tribulation Transcendence Realm, that traitor can forget about living!”

Great Sage Green Python secretly decided.

…

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

Bleeding from his seven orifices, Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune. He thought to himself, “I wonder how the Great Sage Green Python is now?”

Somehow, he felt that it was not going well.

Because Yang Tiandong was still being beaten and hunted.

If Great Sage Green Python were to find him, he would definitely die.

However, all that happened were demon attacks. What did that mean?

This meant that Great Sage Green Python was likely in seclusion, attempting to break through to the Tribulation Transcendence Realm!

Han Jue immediately felt a strong sense of danger.

After all, he had yet to fight a Tribulation Transcendence cultivator. When Yang Tiandong had nowhere else to go, he would definitely return to the Jade Pure Sect. If Great Sage Green Python came along, he would have to face it.

Han Jue took a deep breath and didn’t continue cursing the Vermilion Bird and Mo Youling. Instead, he began to meditate and cultivate.

A year later.

Mo Fuchou, Zhou Fan, and Xuan Shishi left the Jade Pure Sect.

They left very suddenly. Li Qingzi didn’t even have the chance to stop them.

Another six years passed.

Han Jue finally broke through to the seventh level of the Body Integration Realm.

The Heaven and Earth Grass was also growing healthily. With the help of the Fusang Tree and the Earth Immortal Gourd Vine, the Spirit Qi of the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain was constantly increasing. The cultivation of the Black Hell Chicken, Xun Chang’an, and Fairy Xi Xuan also kept increasing, but not as fast as Han Jue’s.

Han Jue checked his emails.
