Chapter 798 Ancestor’s Challenge

“Are you here for the Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower?” Ancestor Xitian asked.

His tone was casual as if he was chatting with an old friend.

Han Jue said, “That’s right. Life abducted the Heavenly Dao Sages one after another and now, he attacked the Heavenly Emperor and my disciple. I can’t sit by and watch.”

Ancestor Xitian narrowed his eyes and asked, “So, you’re here to warn me?”

Han Jue shook his head. “How can I dare to warn you? I’m just puzzled. Ancestor, why did you enter Life?”

Ancestor Xitian said, “Because there’s no place for me in the Chaos.”

Han Jue asked, “Then, why can Life tolerate

you?”

This question had many meanings.

Han Jue was very puzzled. Wasn’t Life also threatening the Chaos? Why didn’t the Chaotic Deities interfere? Would the Chaotic Deities let Ancestor Xitian go once Life took him in?

Could it be that the Chaotic Deities were behind Life?

However, he had calculated before that the First Life Black Sovereign had no backing.

Ancestor Xitian stared at Han Jue with a deep gaze, as if he could see through him.

Han Jue understood calmly.

Now that even the Chaotic Deities could not attack his Dao Field, he was really not too afraid.

However, it was naturally a good thing to reduce some trouble.

Ancestor Xitian said faintly, “Perhaps this is a trap. Life is in it and doesn’t know. I took advantage of the situation and lived. At least, there was an additional chance of survival.”

Han Jue heard a hint of sorrow.

It was a pity.

If not for the system and the Dao Field, he would have to face such a tragic scene.

Han Jue hesitated for a moment and said, “If you don’t mind, I’m willing to protect you as long as you’re willing to come.” “Hahaha”

Ancestor Xitian suddenly laughed. His laughter was filled with disdain.

Han Jue showed a frown.

After Ancestor Xitian finished laughing, he shook his head and said, “I didn’t expect this. I didn’t expect this. I’ve presided over the Heavenly Dao for billions of years and preached the Dao to countless Dao Seekers. Now, I’m being pitied by a junior who once asked me for guidance. How tragic and unfortunate is this?”

“However, it’s worth it to have one person dare to take me in. I didn’t preach the Dao for nothing.”

He suddenly stared at him and his eyes became sharp. “Han Jue, if you want to save the Heavenly Emperor and Zhou Fan, then come. Defeat me openly and I’ll let them go!”

[Ancestor Xitian’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 5 stars]

As he declared war, his favorability increased?

Han Jue was confused.

Ancestor Xitian said meaningfully, “Come. If you come, it won’t only be for the Heavenly Emperor, but also for your disciple and yourself. You look powerful now, but you can’t see everything clearly.”

Han Jue frowned. Was he hinting at the Chaotic Deities?

Would he be considered to have cut ties with him if he went to fight Ancestor Xitian?

“By the way, let me remind you. Previously, I only left a clone in the Heavenly Dao. I’ve been suppressing my cultivation. You have to use your full strength if you want to fight

me.”

Ancestor Xitian smiled as the dream shattered.

Han Jue opened his eyes.

The ancestor could actually forcefully break through his Dark Nightmare!

He checked Ancestor Xitian’s portrait and discovered that his cultivation level was still at the mid-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm.

Could this be a disguise?

Han Jue asked in his mind, “If Ancestor Xitian uses his full strength, can I insta-kill him?”

(300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

It was comparable to the Foolish Sword Sage!

Not bad!

Continue!

[Yes]

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

No.

Not stable enough.

“If Ancestor Xitian uses his full strength, can he insta-kill me?”

[No]

Han Jue completely relaxed. The core of the two questions was about Ancestor Xitian’s true strength, so his lifespan was not deducted the second time.

He hesitated.

Should he go?

“If I go and stop Ancestor Xitian, will I be attacked by the Chaotic Deities and the Great Dao Supreme?” Han Jue asked in his mind. It would have been fine if it was in the past.

Now, he was a little angry at Ancestor Xitian’s unclear words.

(i quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)

Continue!

[No]

Han Jue was completely relieved.

At the same time, he despised the First Life Black Sovereign. This fellow was hiding in the dark. He didn’t dare to show himself even when his subordinates were killed.

Han Jue looked at the Chaos and quickly found the battlefield where the Heavenly Court, the Great Dao Tower, and Life were fighting

The universe where the Great Dao Tower was located was in chaos.

The immortals of the Heavenly Court and the cultivators of the Great Dao Tower were fighting countless Life Servants.

The Life Servants came from various races, but they all had a common characteristic-a strange black aura surrounded them. There were even black patterns on their bodies as if they were ferocious beasts that had fallen into the darkness.

The number of Life Servants was not less than the number of living beings in the Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower. In fact, there were even more.

Li Daokong was fighting Zhou Fan. The two were on par.

As for Ancestor Xitian, he was above the entire battlefield. He sat in the void and kept casting spells with both hands. His vast Dharmic powers transformed into huge chains that trapped a terrifying black shadow.

The Inauspicious Divine Emperor!

Han Jue was curious. What was the relationship between the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the Inauspicious Divine Emperor? Why did he always help him?

Could it be the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s father!

However, the Inauspicious Evil was not a living being. How could it have children?

The Inauspicious Divine Emperor was clearly not Ancestor Xitian’s match. Ancestor Xitian did not kill him either, as if he was waiting for someone.

Han Jue knew that Ancestor Xitian was waiting for him.

Clearly, if Ancestor Xitian was serious, this battle would have ended long ago. It wouldn’t have lasted so long.

Ancestor Xitian was forcing him to appear.

ClangLi Daokong slashed at the Great Dao Tower, causing a violent sound wave that shook the void.

Zhou Fan held the Great Dao Tower and cursed, “Li Daokong, you’re f*cking ruthless! Can you act well?”

Li Daokong shook his sword and tilted his head to look at him with a smile. “Didn’t you brag about your Great Dao Tower? I want to see if your Great Dao Tower can block my Sword Dao!”

On the other side, Shi Dudao was even more furious. The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not use a Supreme Treasure and entirely relied on his great Dharmic powers to suppress him, making him very aggrieved.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor ignored Shi Dudao’s anger and focused on Ancestor Xitian.

“Ancestor, what are you waiting for?” The Evil Heavenly Emperor thought to himself. He could sense that Ancestor Xitian was only acting, so he did not dare to rashly kill Shi Dudao.

His greatest trump card, the Inauspicious Divine Emperor, was not Ancestor Xitian’s match. He had no chance of winning.

He was puzzled, but he couldn’t ask directly. The soldier’s morale would take a blow once he did.

“Roar!”

The Inauspicious Divine Emperor roared again. He suddenly dispersed, and Ancestor Xitian’s Dharmic powers chain missed.

Immediately after, a black shadow appeared behind Ancestor Xitian. It was the Inauspicious Divine Emperor.

The Inauspicious Divine Emperor transformed into darkness and drowned Ancestor Xitian.

The darkness shattered like a glass ball. Ancestor Xitian appeared and raised his right hand, causing a golden river to appear.

Ancestor Xitian muttered a strange sound, causing the golden river to emit a strong light and suck all the surrounding dark fragments into the river.
