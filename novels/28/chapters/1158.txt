Chapter 1161 Long-term Seclusion

Swish! Swish! Swish…

The sword shadows from all directions sped towards Heavenly Venerate Xun, forcing him to dodge. At first, he could still dodge, but the speed of these sword shadows became faster and faster. In less than ten breaths of time, his body was destroyed by the thousands of sword shadows, leaving only his soul.

The sword shadows stopped and gave him time to recover his body. Just as he did, the sword shadows attacked again.

The cycle repeated. Heavenly Venerate Xun was constantly killed and revived. This

torture tormented him. He even cursed Li Yao, but unfortunately, he did not receive a

response.

At the same time.

Li Yao and Han Yunjin left the Heavenly Dao and flew towards the nearest world.

“You still have to be wary of this kid,” Li Yao said meaningfully.

Han Yunjin said, “No matter what, he’s still my son. He shouldn’t harm me.”

“Don’t you have any questions about his soul?”

“What do you

mean?”

Han Yunjin frowned.

Li Yao said meaningfully, “Can’t you sense that in his previous life, he seemed to have a new soul?”

Han Yunjin nodded. “Isn’t he a new soul?”

“With his potential, can he be so strong if he’s a new soul? Has his cultivation been taught by you since he was young?”

“No.”

Han Yunjin frowned.

Previously, he had been puzzled. Why did Heavenly Venerate Xun become stronger so quickly when his potential was clearly average? However, he did not think too much about it when he thought of the similar examples that had already appeared among the descendants of the Han family.

Now he realized that something was wrong.

Li Yao said helplessly, “How can there be so many new souls? New souls often appear in Connate lifeforms or new races. Most of the descendants of the Han family have their previous lives, including your precious son. I can already sense the power of his Great Dao World. This kid must have been a Great Dao Supreme in his previous life. Perhaps he hasn’t sensed this now, but one day, he will awaken all the memories of his previous life.”

Han Yunjin was moved.

A Great Dao Supreme had reincarnated into the Han family?

His first thought was that it was a scheme!

A Great Dao Supreme wouldn’t be affected by the cycle of reincarnation. They would either be forced to enter it or on their own accord. No matter which it was, they could choose their background. The providence of the Han family was illustrious, and it was very difficult for ordinary people to reincarnate into their bloodline. The mighty figures were also afraid of misunderstandings and would not easily be affected by karma.

However, that was only a guess. Heavenly Venerate Xun was indeed his son.

If it was all calculated in his previous life, he would have no children.

Li Yao smiled. “I’m just reminding you. In any case, the karma between you and your son has been established. I’ll help you train him during this period of time.”

“Thank you, Mother.”

Han Yunjin sighed.

…

Ten million years later.

Han Jue opened his eyes.

He had wanted to enter seclusion for fifty

million years, but someone was looking for him, so he had no choice but to stop.

“Come in.”

With that, Han Yunjin, who had been waiting

outside the Daoist temple for millions of years, entered. Han Tuo followed. But he had

only waited for tens of thousands of years.

Han Yunjin knelt down in front of him and

said, “Father, please save my son.” Han Tuo also knelt down and bowed.

Han Jue didn’t say anything. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Han Yunjin immediately told him what had

happened to Heavenly Venerate Xun. After being disciplined by Li Yao for ten thousand years, his temperament had changed greatly, making Han Yunjin very glad. In the following years, Heavenly Venerate Xun helped the Han family overcome difficulties

and open up many worlds. Later, Heavenly Venerate Xun’s cultivation level encountered a bottleneck and he went to find Han Tuo to

cultivate.

Han Tuo taught him for a million years and asked Heavenly Venerate Xun to go to the Consciousnessless Domain to find

opportunities. He did not expect him to

disappear.

“I searched for a long time but couldn’t find

that kid. I can only suspect that it’s related to a Dao Creator.”

Han Tuo frowned. He was also responsible for this matter. He had wandered in the Consciousnessless Domain before and knew

many places of opportunities, so he recommended Heavenly Venerate Xun go

there.

It would have been fine if Heavenly Venerate

Xun wasn’t Han Yunjin’s son. It was difficult to predict whether he would live or die. With Chu Xiaoqi’s example, Han Tuo felt that Han Jue might care about his grandson, so he came with Han Yunjin to seek help. Han Jue said, “Everyone has their own opportunities. He just disappeared for millions of years. Why worry? Isn’t there a second person among your children who disappeared for millions of years or died young?”

Han Yunjin hesitated.

For some reason, Heavenly Venerate Xun was

once the most rebellious, but he was also the one he cared about the most.

Han Jue said, “You can leave if there’s nothing else. That kid won’t die.” Hearing this, Han Yunjin looked pleasantly

surprised. Han Tuo heaved a sigh of relief.

Han Yunjin bowed and left, but Han Tuo stayed.

He naturally wanted to ask about the Great

Dao World. Han Jue was not biased and allowed him to sense the basic rules. Even if it was only for an instant, it was

enough for Han Tuo to get on the right track. One had to condense at least seven Supreme Rules if one wanted to step into the Dao Creator Realm. Han Huang and the Dao Ancestor, who had been the first to create a Supreme Rule, had yet to condense a second Supreme Rule.

It would be at least five billion years before a new Dao Creator appeared.

Han Tuo hurriedly thanked him after he woke

up.

Han Jue waved his hand and Han Tuo left.

Han Jue shook his head slightly as he looked at his departing back.

Among his five children, the one who had the

least relationship with him was Han Tuo. It was mainly because they had only interacted for a short period of time. Han Tuo was not the kind of person to behave like a child. To be honest, his eldest son was more reliable than his other children. Unfortunately, his potential was not good. He was only at the level of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.

After his two sons left, Han Jue looked at the emails and entered cultivation.

The Endless Era would not bring Han Jue joy before a new Dao Creator appeared.

Han Jue prepared to enter an unprecedented

long seclusion.

…

Dao Mystic Realm.

In a grand hall.

Formless World stood on a platform and

looked down at the dozens of figures before

him. Among them were Chu Xiaoqi and Chen

Jue. Formless World’s expression darkened as he said, “Everyone should understand why I called you here. From today onwards, the Dao

Mystic Realm is not to fight among themselves anymore. We have to resist the attack of the Primordial Chaos together. Primordial Origin brought billions of Primordial lifeforms and declared that he

wants to occupy the Great Dao Lake. This

matter

is very important. The entire Dao

Mystic Realm has to join forces to resist him.”

A mighty figure asked, “It’s said that you

have… a mighty figure as your backer. How dare he come?”

It was no longer a secret that the Formless

Transcendent Deity was the backing of

Formless World.

Formless World snorted. “The Great Deity supervises the entire Endless Era. How can he

be biased? He will indeed help me build the Dao Mystic Realm, but he won’t interfere in the battle of factions. Besides, I don’t care about the tiny Primordial Origin. I’ll deal with him. All of you, resist the Primordial faction. Since Primordial Origin dared to come, you can devour his Primordial Chaos!” The mighty figures in the hall looked at each

other. No one dared to refute, but many of them were from various factions, so their

thoughts wandered. Formless World scanned the surroundings and said meaningfully, “It’s time to take sides. You were only mediocre when you came here. You were like a mortal world that the

various Great Dao Worlds don’t need. I nurtured you to your current height. I hope you know that this battle is also a test. If you are disloyal, it depends on whether you dare to jump out of this boat.”
