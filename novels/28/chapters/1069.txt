Chapter 1071 Dao Creator’s Calamity

Han Jue saw endless evil devils following behind the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil. Among them was a familiar figure.

Strange Deity!

This strange fellow from the Evils had been growing over the years. Previously, he had even fought with Han Huang. It looked like he was doing well now that he was mixed in with the evil devils.

He could use the Strange Deity to monitor the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.

Han Jue and the Strange Deity’s soul had long fused into one. The stronger he was, the stronger the Strange Deity was. On the contrary, it was impossible for the Strange Deity to surpass him. This was also the reason why he dared to let the Strange Deity go. With him around, nothing would happen to the Strange Deity.

Han Jue immediately sent a dream to the Strange Deity.

The dream was a Daoist temple.

The Strange Deity was stunned and he saw him. He hurriedly came over and nodded without his usual sinister aura.

Han Jue said, “Why are you hanging out with the evil devils?”

The Strange Deity was originally invisible to any existence. It was like an Inauspicious Evil that couldn’t be spied on, but it had attack power. Han Jue was not used to it now that the Strange Deity had revealed its body.

He was not as cute as before.

“I want to eat them. I feel that they are very strong.” The Strange Deity chuckled.

Han Jue reminded, “Be careful. The existence behind them is not simple.”

The Strange Deity came up to massage Han Jue’s shoulders and smiled fawningly. “Then if something happens, you have to help me, Master.”

“I can’t help you.”

“That’s fine. At most, I’ll die. In any case, you

can revive me. Furthermore, it can be considered a contribution to the Chaos if I succeed.”

The Strange Deity smiled shamelessly.

He was indeed not as cute as before. What had this fellow absorbed? Why was he so glib?

The Strange Deity continued to flatter Han Jue and fawn on him. Ever since he came out, this was the first time Han Jue visited him in his dreams. This made him very excited.

After a long while…

Han Jue instructed him and ended the dream after the Strange Deity finished speaking.

“He even dares to devour the Ninth Chaos’ mental demon. This fellow is really bold.” Han Jue was suddenly interested in the Inauspicious Evil.

What rules did the invisible ghosts wandering in the Chaos evolve from? And where did the Strange Deities that fed on the Inauspicious Evil come from?

As a Dao Creator, Han Jue couldn’t completely understand it. Perhaps it was related to the Ninth Chaos’ Transcendent Rule.

It was even to the extent that the Inauspicious Evil actually had the same goal as the current evil devils who ran rampant in the Chaos. However, the Inauspicious Evil used the souls of living beings as the evolution process and the evil devils were directly born.

Han Jue looked at the blank domain next.

The Purity Great Dao World of the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was getting closer and closer to the Chaos. This Dao Creator was very

strong, and so was his Great Dao World. Their arrival would definitely change the situation in the Chaos.

Han Jue started to check his emails.

He was mainly paying attention to Su Qi.

[Your disciple Su Qi was attacked by a

Transcendent Cultivator] x1920098

[Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck, causing a

lineage to collapse.]

[Your son Han Huang encountered your good friend Huang Zuntian in a dream. His soul was

damaged.]

[Your enemy, the Ninth Chaos, expelled his mental demon and created a clone. His

providence has decreased greatly.]

[Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck, causing

the three thousand Great Dao in the Transcendent World to be damaged.]

[Your good friend Huang Zuntian has been

deprived of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. His soul has been damaged.]

…

[Your good friend Chaotic Consciousness was attacked by a transcendent existence.] [Your good friend Strange Deity devoured the Chaotic Evil Devils and his cultivation level

increased.]

…

Su Qi’s bad luck was as impressive as ever. His cultivation level had been increasing after so many years. He was already a Great Dao Supreme. It was not difficult to understand why he could shake the three thousand Great

Dao.

However, the Ninth Chaos had actually created a clone of his mental demon. This was a way.

Some Dao Creators even fought.

It was unknown who was bullying the Chaotic

Consciousness.

Han Jue concluded after reading the emails.

Although there were endless storms and changes, his cultivation was not affected.

He was about to close his eyes and cultivate when he suddenly felt something and disappeared from the Dao Field.

He came to the mysterious space where the

Dao Creators met.

The Chaotic Consciousness, the Formless Transcendent Deity, and the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable were all here.

Could it be that the one who attacked the

Chaotic Consciousness was the mysterious Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity?

“Something bad has happened. He was indeed

cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord to develop mental demons. He expelled the mental demons. Now, the mental demons are being

nurtured. This will be a disaster,” the Chaotic Consciousness said in a low voice. The Formless Transcendent Deity asked in surprise, “What about him? Why didn’t he

restrain him?”

The Chaotic Consciousness said, “This time,

consumed too much. He will fall into a deep sleep. That mental demon is also being nurtured. He entrusted us with it. During his

sleep, if the mental demon awakens, we have to stop him.”

The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said in a low voice, “How’s the mental demon’s

strength?”

“To be able to make him fall asleep, I’m afraid… So, we have to work together.” Han Jue didn’t speak and just listened quietly.

“Can I insta-kill the Ninth Chaos’ mental demon?”

[50 quadrillion years of lifespan will be

deducted. Do you want to continue?] Almost half of his main body’s value! Continue!

[No]

Han Jue’s heart sank.

“Then, can the mental demon kill me?”

[No]

That was good.

Han Jue relaxed again.

With this value, even all these Dao Creators

combined were not the Ninth Chaos’ mental demon’s match.

“I keep feeling that something is wrong,” the

Formless Transcendent Deity suddenly said. The Chaotic Consciousness and the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable were

silent.

Han Jue also felt that something was wrong.

How powerful was the Ninth Chaos? How could

it be forced to such a state by a mental demon? Could it be…

The Chaotic Consciousness said faintly, “He has his own righteousness. The rules he set for himself helped us, but they also made him fall

into a dilemma now. Only this method can resolve his problem.”

Han Jue understood what he meant. Although

the Ninth Chaos was invincible, it liked to be reasonable and never bullied the juniors. This was also the reason why they could rise. From

this, it could be seen that the Ninth Chaos had righteousness and principles.

Now that the Ninth Chaos was threatened by the Dark Forbidden Lord, he felt uneasy. He wanted to eliminate the trouble, but he did not know who the other party was.

If it was anyone else in his position, they would definitely rather kill everyone by mistake than let them go. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Ninth Chaos did not want this to happen,

so he created a clone and let it resolve the

matter.

“There’s no other way. We can only prepare to

deal with it. This might be our calamity. We have to tell the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity about this. We have to be united!” the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said

coldly. Since they could not escape, why guess? They

had to face it.

“Then where is the mental demon?” Han Jue suddenly asked.

The Chaotic Consciousness said, “It’s the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil that wreaks havoc

in the Chaos. The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil is

only a shell. The true mental demon is still being nurtured.”

“What will happen if we kill him directly?”

“When the mental demon is shattered, his power will impact the Chaos and everything. It’s equivalent to us facing a full-powered

attack from his main body.

The Chaotic Consciousness’s words were filled with helplessness.
