Chapter 1188 Special Basic Rule

“First, there was Han Liang, then the Endless Fiendcelestial, and now this fellow. It seems that the blank domain sensed my threat and is thinking of a way to devour me.”

Han Jue thought silently. The current Ultimate Origin World had expanded countless times. It was already endless to a Freedom Sage. Only a Great Dao Sage could jump out, but it would also take a long time.

The Ultimate Origin World was not only as big as it looked but also the improvement of the rules of space. For example, a Great Dao Sage couldn’t jump out with a thought. This obstacle was equivalent to Han Jue facing a blank

domain, and he couldn’t jump out just because he wanted to.

!!

The expansion of the Great Dao World was never visible to the naked eye.

Han Jue stood up and disappeared.

He came in front of the mysterious thunder egg. In an instant, the various bolts of lightning in the void instantly stopped. Even the light that surged towards the thunder egg stopped.

The Formless Transcendent Deity appeared beside him and bowed respectfully.

His cultivation level had been increasing ever since he grasped the power of the Endless Era. However, facing Han Jue, he inexplicably felt that the difference between them was

becoming greater and greater.

“Master, what should we do with this?” the Formless Transcendent Deity asked respectfully.

Han Jue said, “I’ll take him away and discipline him well.”

The Formless Transcendent Deity asked in surprise, “You can take him away?”

Han Jue waved his hand. The extremely huge thunder egg quickly shrank and landed in his palm.

The Formless Transcendent Deity was shocked. Previously, so many Dao Creators had joined forces, but they had not shaken this egg. But the Lord had casually put it away.

Han Jue clenched his right hand and the thunder egg disappeared.

At this moment, the stagnant lightning struck Han Jue. His eyes turned cold. All the lightning dissipated and the surrounding space distorted violently.

The Formless Transcendent Deity felt a terrifying power. This power was extremely

terrifying, but he could not capture where this power came from. It was definitely not from the Lord.

The Rule Power of the blank domain?

The Formless Transcendent Deity was shocked.

The Lord could already ignore the rules of the blank domain?

Han Jue smiled at the Formless Transcendent Deity and said, “My cultivation level has increased a little. It didn’t disappoint me.”

The Formless Transcendent Deity was

flattered.

Han Jue disappeared.

The Formless Transcendent Deity sighed and

left.

…

Back in the third Dao Field.

Han Jue threw the thunder egg into the

Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison. The thunder egg floated in the middle corner like a black

hole.

The Origin Divine Millet suddenly appeared from the wall and approached the thunder egg

to observe.

The Origin Divine Millet was formed by the Origin Space-time. Ever since it was subdued by Han Jue, it had been wandering around the Dao Field. The disciples knew of its existence and determined it to be a divine beast of the

Dao Field.

Han Jue smiled and said, “Don’t touch it. You’ll

be injured.”

The snake head of the Origin Divine Millet quickly nodded. Then, it circled a few times

and left.

Han Jue took the time to look at the blank

domain.

After twenty billion years, the Endless Era had

already spread. The Great Dao Worlds were far apart and countless worlds were born, causing the blank domain to become lively. The domain of the Ultimate Origin World was still slow compared to the expansion speed of the Great Dao World of the Endless Era.

Now, there were already fifteen Dao Creators, and this was even when the three Primordial Fiendcelestials were counted as one.

Han Liang and Chu Xiaoqi were also about to become Dao Creators, but they had all encountered a bottleneck, mainly because they had too little experience. Their generation had

rarely encountered a huge calamity and had

less understanding of fate. Chu Xiaoqi had participated in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity in his previous life, but the negative karma of Primordial Despair was a burden, causing his Great Dao World to be unstable.

Negative karma storms would occasionally appear and wreak havoc.

Han Jue no longer had any special feelings for them. He no longer cared if they could successfully attain the Dao.

The current Han Jue only wanted to surpass

the Creator Lord Realm quickly.

In the future, existences more outstanding than the thunder egg would definitely appear. He couldn’t relax in his cultivation.

Compared to when he had just become a

Creator Lord, Han Jue’s strength was already

dozens of times stronger. He had been rapidly becoming stronger, but he didn’t break through a minor realm. Perhaps the Creator

Lord Realm didn’t have a minor realm at all. It

was probably the same for the realms above. Ultimate Origin Supreme was Han Jue’s definition of the realm above the Creator Lord.

He had two hypotheses. One was that the Ultimate Origin World could replace the blank

domain and allow him to become the Ultimate Origin Supreme.

Second, break through in advance!

The way to break through was only possible through increasing one’s potential. Currently, Han Jue only had one Ultimate

Origin Fragment and fifteen Primordial Fragments. Nine Ultimate Origin Fragments

could only be combined into the Ultimate Origin Great Creation. Now, he could only trigger the choice reward once every ten billion

years. It still required an extremely long time to rely on the Ultimate Origin Great Creation. He decided to walk his own path. He did not have to rely on the system!

The system was formed by the Creation Will of

the blank domain. Countless previous owners had accumulated creation to be where they Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

were today.

He began to think about how the Creation Will

became stronger.

The system’s explanation was that the stronger he was, the stronger the system was. However, the system was always above him.

It seemed that the reason was still above the basic rules of the blank domain. Without him moving, how could the system absorb the power of basic rules?

Karma, faith, providence…

Invisible and untouchable powers existed in

the unseen world.

Could it be that the system was absorbing his providence, faith, and karma?

Could the basic rules of the blank domain also

have such a thing?

Han Jue fell into deep thought. His will entered

the space of the blank domain and faced the

basic rules.

What greeted his eyes were colorful Rule Lights of different forms and speeds. The number reached a level that even he, the Creator Lord, could not estimate.

Everything around him was flowing at high

speed. Han Jue began to search for special basic rules.

He might not have been able to do it in the

past, but he might be able to find it now that he was much stronger.

When Han Jue was immersed in the basic rules, on the surface of the blank domain.

A Sword Dao River swept through the pale void.

Li Daokong stood on the waves with his hands behind his waist.

“Kid, you can’t escape anymore. Give up,” Li Daokong said expressionlessly. Following his gaze, a figure was faintly discernible ahead. It was very fast.

Soon, the figure stopped and revealed its true body. It was a white-haired man. It was Emperor Chen Ni’s reincarnation. After ten billion years, Emperor Chen Ni rose

again as a living being of the Ultimate Origin World. However, he did not have memories of his previous life and only relied on his nature. In this life, he was still called Emperor Chen Ni. Chen Ni was his name. It entered the depths of his soul and could not be erased. “Endless God, what are you doing!” Emperor Chen Ni said angrily, his tone uneasy. The Sword Dao River surged over. Li Daokong

looked down at him and said, “As a living being of the Ultimate Origin World, you shouldn’t come out and devour other Great Dao Worlds. You’re embarrassing the Lord.”

Emperor Chen Ni laughed in anger. “Could it be that the Ultimate Origin World has never devoured other Great Dao Worlds? I’m just helping the Lord!”
