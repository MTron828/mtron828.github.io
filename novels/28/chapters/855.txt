Chapter 858 Establishment of the Third Dao Field

Unknowingly, Han Jue’s seclusion time became a hundred thousand years.

Another hundred thousand years passed.

During this period, Han Jue felt a battle fluctuation outside the Heavenly Dao. However, it ended very quickly and didn’t harm the Heavenly Dao, so he didn’t pay too much attention.

He opened his eyes on time after a hundred thousand years.

It had been more than 600,000 years since he had attained the Great Dao Supreme Realm, but he was still far from the mid-stage.

Han Jue first looked near the Heavenly Dao. The previous battle had long ended. There was no suspicious aura nearby and no traces of battle. Everything looked very normal, as if a battle had never occurred.

He counted with his fingers and immediately lost interest when he learned that it was the Foolish Sword Sage who had killed the attacker.

He jumped to the Chaos and began to observe the universe of stars he had thrown out.

This universe had already developed as many stars as Han Jue. They were dense and formed vortexes of stars of different sizes. They were dazzling.

The Creation Rule was still nourishing this universe. All sorts of Spirit Qi appeared in the galaxy. The stars began to flow and gradually gained life.

Han Jue suddenly had an idea.

He thought of establishing the third Dao Field in this universe. In any case, Han Jue no longer needed a new hiding place. When the time came, wouldn’t it be even more beautiful to directly comprehend the power of creation in the third Dao Field?

After thinking, Han Jue made up his mind.

He first sent a dream to Liu Bei.

The dream was in the Daoist temple. Han Jue said, “There’s no need to look anymore. Come back.”

Liu Bei opened his eyes and was stunned.

“We’re not looking anymore?” Liu Bei asked with a long face.

Han Jue frowned and asked, “What’s wrong?”

Liu Bei muttered, “I’m trapped.”

Han Jue asked, “By who?”

“I’m not sure...”

Han Jue frowned even more.

After the dream was removed, Han Jue asked in his mind, “Can I insta-kill the mysterious existence who trapped Liu Bei?”

[400 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Erm...

Too weak!

Han Jue subconsciously wanted to ignore it, but after thinking about it, he decided to be steady.

Continue!

(Yes]

Han Jue cursed silently. He was really cowardly. What was there to be stable about?

He began to wait for Liu Bei to use the Invocation Technique.

No matter what, Liu Bei was trembling in fear because of his orders. Even if he didn’t contribute, he had worked hard. Han Jue couldn’t let him be bullied.

Han Jue’s will had always been left in the Daoist temple so that he could revive when he died.

After a while, a black vortex appeared in front of Han Jue.

He activated all his Supreme Treasures and divine light burst out. Then, he stepped into the black vortex.

Almost instantly, he arrived at a barren red land. Scorching heat surged from all directions.

Han Jue moved Liu Bei in front of him as soon as he caught his aura.

Liu Bei was overjoyed to see him.

Han Jue ignored him as his gaze landed on a figure halfway up the mountain.

This person had three eyes and exuded an evil aura. For some reason, Han Jue thought of the Inauspicious Evil.

“Why are you trapping my clone?” Han Jue asked coldly.

The other party opened his eyes and stared at him with three eyes. He suddenly stood up.

“Great Dao Supreme, what an unfamiliar aura. No wonder I can’t deduce this person’s background. Since you’re here, let’s fight and test your ability!” the other party said in an ancient and cold voice.

Han Jue asked, “You have to say your name, right?”

The other party said calmly, “I’m the Mad Dao...”

Han Jue suddenly condensed the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial Dharma idol and punched him before he could finish speaking.

The ten-thousand-foot-tall Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial bent its back forward and punched down from the sky. This punch was too fast. The Mad Daoist was directly smashed by the mountain-like fist.

Boom

The ground collapsed and dust flew, carrying countless magma. Immediately after, the entire star was covered in cracks and shattered, forming a circle of airwaves that expanded parallel to each other. The void twisted violently.

Han Jue grabbed Liu Bei and stepped into the black vortex.

The black vortex shrank.

Han Jue held the Primordial Judgment Sword and stood in front of the black vortex, waiting for it to shrink.

He suddenly felt a powerful aura attack. He immediately waved his sword and the sword Qi entered the black vortex, destroying Mad Daoist’s body.

At this moment, the black vortex vanished.

Liu Bei heaved a sigh of relief.

Han Jue suddenly turned around and used a Great Change Sealing Palm to stop him.

His Sage Sense entered Liu Bei’s body and erased all the marks left behind by Mad Daoist.

He only let go of Liu Bei after ten breaths.

Liu Bei asked carefully, “He did something to my body?”

“Yes. Otherwise, how could he let you live for so long?”

“True,” Liu Bei said awkwardly.

Han Jue waved his hand and gestured for him to leave.

Liu Bei immediately bowed and left.

(The Mad Daoist has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 3 stars]

Han Jue immediately checked the Mad Daoist’s profile picture.

[Mad Daoist: Mid-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm, Chaotic Lifeform, Transcendent Dao Expert. Because of your terrifying strength, he is afraid of you. Current Hatred Points: 3 stars]

“Never heard of him.”

Han Jue didn’t care. This hatred was nothing. After all, Liu Bei had accidentally entered the other party’s Dao Field.

He was a reasonable person. The previous battle was already a lesson. He couldn’t kill the other party just because he didn’t like him. It wasn’t easy to cultivate for countless years.

“Can I rely on the wisp of will in the Daoist temple to revive if I leave the Heavenly Dao now and am killed by the Chaotic Consciousness or the Ninth Chaos?” Han Jue asked in his mind in case the other party had extraordinary methods.

[100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[Yes]

That’s good! Han Jue immediately jumped out of the Heavenly Dao and rushed to the universe of stars as quickly as possible.

He could also try to see if he would be attacked if he left the Heavenly Dao!

Han Jue was still very nervous. After all, he hadn’t traveled the Chaos for many years.

Previously, it was at most a clone. This was the first time he used his main body.

He moved quickly.

Several breaths later, he arrived at the universe of stars.

This was the speed of the Great Dao, even if the Chaos was vast.

Han Jue floated above the universe of stars and looked down at the countless stars. He quickly found a huge star in the center and landed, then established the third Dao Field.

[Third Dao Field has been successfully established.]

A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue. Then, he felt an invisible force circle an area of ten million kilometers, isolating the aura of the outside world.

Spirit Qi and Connate Qį began to grow, indicating that the Dao Field was about to be synchronized with the main Dao Field and the second Dao Field.

Han Jue began to erase the aura, trajectory, and karma that descended into this universe of stars.

All of this could not be seen with the naked eye, but he could use his will to erase it.

This was also the reason why a Great Dao Supreme could appear and disappear unpredictably.

“I want to know if anyone discovered me coming here now?” Han Jue still asked cautiously.

[100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)

So expensive?

Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat.

He chose to continue.

[No]
