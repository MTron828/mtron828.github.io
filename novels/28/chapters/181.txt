Chapter 183 When Immortals Fight, Mortals Suffer

Giant Spiritual Martial God’s words caused the entire world to go mad.

The Immortal Gods wanted to destroy the world!

In this desperate situation, no one dared to challenge them.

They were still in denial.

What if the Immortal Gods were joking?

Han Jue was hesitating. Should he take the initiative to attack, or should he wait for the immortals to come to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain?

“How can we cultivators fear death!”

An ancient voice sounded. To be precise, it resounded throughout the ten provinces and nine dynasties.

Han Jue had never heard this voice before, but he could feel an aura rising in the distance.

Mahayana Realm cultivator!

He wasn’t the only one. Other Mahayana Realm cultivators flew into the sky. The Mahayana cultivators hidden everywhere in the world moved out.

The world was facing the greatest calamity, they had no choice but to take action.

Ji Xianshen also attacked!

Carrying countless lightning bolts, Ji Xianshen charged into the clouds without hesitation. Behind him were the mighty figures of the Heavenly Immortal Manor.

“So what if they’re Immortal Gods! Humanity can triumph over heaven!”

Ji Xianshen laughed in high spirits.

He had been waiting for this day for a long time!

In the distance!

Waves of black demonic mist surged towards the immortals. Within the demonic mist was the Black Fox Demon Emperor! This was a crisis for all living beings in the world. Even though it was not human, the Black Fox Demon Emperor still had to take action.

This was also the reason why Ji Xianshen did not kill him. Although the Black Fox Demon Emperor united the demons, he had also promised that if the Immortal Gods attacked the mortal world, he would definitely attack.

Dozens of mighty figures from the mortal realm charged into the sky.

Above the layers of thunderclouds, the divine shadows raised their divine weapons and slashed towards the mortal world.

Devastation was at hand!

A dazzling light filled the world, causing Han Jue to squint.

No!

These people couldn’t stop the immortals. He had to take action!

Han Jue left after saying, “Don’t leave this mountain!”

When the strong light dissipated, everyone looked over with wide eyes.

A ten thousand foot tall giant appeared in the air!

It was Han Jue!

Mystical Power, Imitate Heaven and Earth!!

Han Jue rose in the sky as if stepping on an invisible staircase. His golden robe fluttered wantonly.

He raised his hand and used his Dharmic powers to block the vast Dharmic powers from the Heavenly Troops, preventing the Great Yan from being destroyed.

In an instant. The immortals turned around and looked at him.

“It’s him?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What powerful Dharmic powers!”

“There’s actually someone with such a cultivation level in the mortal world?”

“Could it be that he has a Heavenly Dao Stone on him?”

“It’s said that Yang San was killed by him!”

The immortals’ voices were very loud, echoing throughout the mortal world.

Everyone in the world was stunned.

Did this mean that there was a mighty figure in the mortal world who was comparable to an Immortal God?

On the other side of the sky.

Ji Xianshen stabilized himself in the air. His face was pale. He couldn’t withstand the attacks of the Heavenly Soldiers.

However, he couldn’t help but smile when he heard the Heavenly Troops.

No matter what, Daoist Cao would be the one to defend them!

“Hmph!”

A cold snort sounded. It was the voice of Giant Spiritual Martial God.

Standing at the top, Giant Spiritual Martial God suddenly leaned over. All the living beings were shocked and felt as if the sky was collapsing

He was too huge and majestic!

Han Jue saw his face clearly. Even though he was already ten thousand feet tall, he still looked tiny in front of the latter.

“Grand Unity Heaven Immortal? No wonder you dare to be so arrogant!”

Giant Spiritual Martial God snorted, his tone filled with killing intent.

Numinous Palace.

The immortals in the hall were shocked.

“Grand Unity Heaven Immortal? Why would such a monster appear in the mortal world?” “Could it be that someone from the Immortal World has descended into the mortal world?”

“I’m not sure, but no matter what, he’s indeed a good recruitment target for the Heavenly Court. After all, he appeared in the mortal world we control.”

“How old is he?”

“I can’t deduce it. He should have a Supreme Treasure on him that can block karma deductions.”

The Heavenly Emperor was expressionless. He ignored the discussions of the immortals and gods and stared at Han Jue in the mirror.

Han Jue wasn’t afraid of the high and mighty Giant Spiritual Martial God. His expression was calm.

He raised his right hand and pointed his index finger at the sky.

Everyone in the Great Yan could see his huge body.

The scene of Han Jue facing the immortals and pointing at the sky shocked them.

The next scene was something they would never forget.

Boom

Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger!

Sword Qi shot out from Han Jue’s right index finger. The sword light shone brightly!

The Heavenly Soldiers didn’t have time to react. Giant Spiritual Martial God subconsciously raised his palm to block as a terrifying sword Qi exploded, scattering the thunderclouds in the sky.

“Kill

“

With a furious roar from Giant Spiritual Martial God, countless Heavenly Soldiers swooped down from the sea of clouds like a rain of arrows.

A sword appeared in Han Jue’s hand. It was the Primordial Judgment Sword.

He held his sword in one hand and continued to step into the sky, quickly brandishing his sword.

Sword Qi surged with unstoppable momentum!

Heavenly Soldiers were killed by Han Jue one after another.

The Heavenly Soldiers’ strength was at the Loose Immortal Realm. How could they resist the Reincarnation Heaven Immortal Han Jue?

Han Jue didn’t hold back, either. If he spared their lives, wouldn’t the Heavenly Court think that he was afraid?

On the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain, Xun Chang’an, Yang Tiandong, and the others saw Han Jue’s fighting style and trembled with excitement.

“Grandmaster is so strong!” Murong Qi said excitedly. So Grandmaster was really confident. The eyes of the others were filled with shock and admiration.

Fairy Xi Xuan looked at Han Jue’s back and sighed.

Back then, Han Jue had acknowledged her as his master. She had never thought that this child would be strong enough to fight against immortals.

Han Jue pressed forward and easily killed the Heavenly Soldiers along the way. However, his gaze was fixed on Giant Spiritual Martial God.

A perfected Grand Unity Heaven Immortal! It had to be said.

Giant Spiritual Martial God’s aura was indeed terrifying. Even though Han Jue had already reached the mid-stage of the Reincarnation Heaven Immortal Realm, he still felt the pressure. It was very difficult to insta-kill Giant Spiritual Martial God!

However, Han Jue was still confident.

He was invincible at the same cultivation level!

A beam of light descended from the sky like a meteorite and collided with him.

It was Giant Spiritual Martial God.

Giant Spiritual Martial God also used the Mystical Power, Imitate Heaven and Earth. Being ten thousand feet tall, he fought with Han Jue in the sky.

The two Heaven Immortals used their Mystical Powers, causing the sky to tear apart. Space twisted as countless bolts of lightning interwove between heaven and earth.

The mortal world couldn’t withstand it!

Calamities occurred everywhere in the world. Be it mortals or beasts, most of them were fleeing in misery.

Han Jue couldn’t care less about the situation in the mortal world. He focused on the battle seriously.

Although he had been cultivating in seclusion, with the simulation trial around, his combat experience was still very rich.

The Firmament Sword Qi landed on Giant Spiritual Martial God’s body one after another, but it didn’t cause any substantial damage. This fellow’s armor was extraordinary.

Of course, it was even harder for Giant Spiritual Martial God to hurt him. Han Jue kept moving, preventing his saber from striking.

Han Jue suddenly waved his sword. The sword Qi was vast and mighty, turning into an endless sea of sword Qi. Countless sword shadows condensed and appeared densely, like the stars in the universe. Three Pure World Cleansing!

Giant Spiritual Martial God was moved. What kind of Mystical Power was this?

In an instant, countless sword shadows attacked him from all directions. It was grand and spectacular. Stirred, the wind blew in all directions, shaking the forest on the ground and even uprooting it.

When immortals fight, mortals suffer!
