Chapter 229 Golden Age of the Mortal World, Delusional Evil Eye

“What’s happening?”

Han Jue frowned and probed the Heavenly Dao Token with his divine sense.

Fortunately, his cultivation level was high enough. This heat did not affect him.

Soon, Han Jue’s divine sense arrived in front of the Heavenly Dao Tablet.

He checked and was shocked.

No. 763!

The ranking was still rising!

What happened?

Han Jue hurriedly observed the Scarlet Cloud World. The number of Body Integration and Tribulation Transcendence Realm cultivators had increased exponentially over the years. Mahayana Realm cultivators were also continuously emerging.

Not long after, Han Jue caught sight of the White-Robed Buddha.

This fellow was preaching to thousands of cultivators on a tall mountain. These cultivators were at least at the Body Integration Realm, and some people broke through one after another.

Not only that, but cultivators also rushed over to listen.

No wonder the providence of the Scarlet Cloud World had increased so quickly.

As the providence of the world continued to increase, Han Jue clearly felt that his providence was also increasing.

Di Taibai had said that to break through to the Immortal Emperor Realm, one needed a powerful providence.

Isn’t providence here already?

Han Jue felt the distress of happiness.

On one hand, he was afraid that the Scarlet Cloud World would attract attention, but on the other hand, he enjoyed the increase in providence.

Forget it.

He would cultivate first.

Han Jue put down the Heavenly Dao Token and continued cultivating.

He was getting closer and closer to the late stage of the Reincarnation Golden Immortal Realm. After reaching the late stage, he would be closer to perfection.

If he reached the perfected Reincarnation Golden Immortal Realm, would the Immortal Emperor Realm be far away?

After reaching the Immortal Emperor Realm, wouldn’t he be close to the Deity Realm?

Was reaching the Deity Realm still a dream?

Han Jue thought about it and became excited.

He was full of fighting spirit.

When Han Jue was still cultivating, the Heaven and Earth Spirit Qi increased with the providence of the Heavenly Dao.

Everyone was celebrating! This wasn’t the first time the providence of the world had increased greatly. The mighty figures of the Holy Lands declared that this was the grace of the Heavenly Dao. An unprecedented golden age had arrived.

Almost every few years, a prodigy would appear, each with their own style. The demonic path had declined, and the cultivation world welcomed an era where sects competed. There was no competition for morality, only strength!

The Jade Pure Sacred Sect was relatively peaceful. No sect dared to provoke them.

The White-Robed Buddha preached to the world and also gained a reputation. Many temples and statues of the White-Robed Buddha even emerged among the people.

By enjoying the offerings of the mortal world, the White-Robed Buddha’s providence was constantly increasing.

Twenty-eight years later. Three lines of words appeared in front of Han Jue, who was cultivating.

[Detected that you are 2,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]

(1: Immediately ascend and become famous in the Immortal World. You can obtain a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, a Mystical Power inheritance, and a Supreme Treasure.] [2: Don’t ascend for the time being. Follow your Dao heart. You can obtain a Mystical Power inheritance and a Great Dao fragment.]

Han Jue opened his eyes and was curious.

What was a Great Dao fragment?

He immediately chose not to ascend. [You chose not to ascend for the time being. You obtained a Mystical Power inheritance and a Great Dao fragment.]

[Congratulations on obtaining Mystical Power - Five Elements Divine Light)

[Five Elements Divine Light: Ancient Mystical Power with extremely strong attack power. It can forcefully snatch the enemy’s Dharma treasure and forcefully break through the array formation.]

[Congratulations on obtaining the Great Dao fragment.)

[Great Dao Fragment: After gathering nine Great Dao fragments, you will sense the Great Dao and obtain a Supreme Dao technique.]

Supreme Dao technique?

It sounded impressive, but it was useless now.

The system was indeed modeled after a game as its foundation. It was quite grindy.

Han Jue thought silently and chose to inherit the Five Elements Divine Light.

The Five Elements Divine Light wasn’t a Sword Dao Mystical Power. Thus, it took Han Jue several days to master it.

This Mystical Power was indeed powerful!

Han Jue activated the simulation trial and used the Five Elements Divine Light to fight the White-Robed Buddha.

Although he couldn’t kill the enemy instantly, with this Mystical Power, he could easily kill the White-Robed Buddha.

It’s too powerful!

Han Jue was very excited.

He liked such straightforward Mystical Powers.

Although his talent in the Sword Dao was outstanding, he didn’t love the sword.

He had obtained that aptitude after rerolling, but it wasn’t the one he wanted.

In order to celebrate obtaining this Mystical Power, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the enemies.

He checked his emails. Nothing happened.

After Mo Zhu and Mo Fuchou ascended, everything went smoothly. They weren’t attacked.

Under the sea of clouds, a lone mountain peak floated in the sky.

At the top of the mountain was a huge building without a ceiling. The walls were surrounded in a circle, like a beast fighting arena. Huge and sinister stone statues were erected on all sides.

There was a huge stone tablet erected in the square, with a half-naked man tied to it. It was Fang Liang.

Fang Liang’s hair was disheveled and he was covered in injuries.

On the steps at the edge of the square stood cultivators, all of them looking nervous and waiting.

On the high wall to the east was a pavilion. In front of the balcony sat a middle-aged man dressed in expensive-looking clothes. His eyes were sharp.

“I wonder if he can succeed,” a yellow-dressed girl beside the middle-aged man muttered, looking at Fang Liang with worry.

The middle-aged man snorted. “He was chosen by our ancestor. He naturally won’t fail. However, we still have to spend the effort to make him submit to us. Xin’er, are you willing to marry him?” Hearing this, the girl in yellow blushed and nodded shyly.

The middle-aged man looked down at Fang Liang expressionlessly.

“Where did this kid come from? He can actually withstand our ancestor’s divine

power.”

The middle-aged man was secretly shocked. He looked at Fang Liang with jealousy.

Although he was jealous, he knew that he had to please Fang Liang in the future. He would be the hope of their race’s revival!

“Ahhh,”

Tied to the stone tablet, Fang Liang suddenly let out a shrill roar like a ferocious beast, scaring everyone on the steps.

Fang Liang suddenly raised his head. His eyes were bloodshot, and a vertical eye appeared on his forehead. It was a strange dual-pupil eye.

It had been ten years since he had learned the Five Elements Divine Light.

Han Jue suddenly felt Di Taibai’s divine sense fluctuation from the Heavenly Dao Token and immediately took it out.

“Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has gone missing,” Di Taibai said. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Han Jue frowned and asked, “Caught by the Demon Court?”

Wasn’t Fang Liang enlightened by a mighty figure?

He thought that a mighty figure of the Heavenly Court had taken him in.

“No, he went out to train. He has already left for decades. It has exceeded the time limit he promised to return. I asked the two clairvoyants to investigate, but they couldn’t find his whereabouts,” Di Taibai said helplessly.

Han Jue’s grand-disciples were troublesome.

Murong Qi also left with the Divine General as soon as he entered the Heavenly Court.

Han Jue asked, “Even the Heavenly Emperor can’t find him?”

“The world is vast, we can’t tell unless the providence of the Heavenly Court is involved.”

“Alright, I understand. Thank you for your trouble.”

“He’s the son of providence. Even in the Immortal World, his providence won’t be bad. Perhaps the heavens will help him out.”

“Mm.”

After ending the contact, Han Jue started to check his interpersonal relationships.

Fang Liang’s portrait was still there.

He continued to check his emails and quickly found Fang Liang’s status. [Your grand-disciple Fang Liang inherited the Delusional Evil Eye and successfully entered the Grand Unity Heaven Immortal Realm.)

Grand Unity Heaven Immortal Realm?

Tsk tsk, he was really fast!

Han Jue was relieved. It seemed that Fang Liang was fine and had obtained a huge opportunity.

It was useless to worry. He couldn’t go to the Immortal World to find him.

At the critical moment, Fang Liang could still use the Invocation Technique to invite him over.
