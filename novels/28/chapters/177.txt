Chapter 180 Destiny Sword Qi Great Wheel, Son of the Heavenly Emperor

Under the Fusang Tree.

Fang Liang looked up at the sky. It was white, with snow filling the sky.

Tu Ling’er muttered, “There’s something wrong with the snow.”

Because the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain was already a Dao Field, the snow couldn’t fall inside, causing it to become the only mountain that was not covered in snow.

The Three-Headed Wyrm King asked curiously, “What’s wrong?”

“This snow contains Spirit Qi,” Ah Da added. The two Golden Crows also tilted their heads and looked into the sky. Yang Tiandong, Chu Shiren, the Black Hell Chicken, and the Chaotic Heavenly Dog were all looking around.

At this moment.

Han Jue and Dao Comprehension Sword walked out of the cave abode and came to the Fusang Tree.

“The Heavenly Court might be coming,” Han Jue said softly after sitting down.

Heavenly Court!

Everyone was moved.

In the legends, the Heavenly Court was the representative of the Immortal Gods.

Fang Liang had also learned that the Heavenly Court wanted to clean up the mortal world, so he had a complicated expression. “What do you mean?” Tu Ling’er was puzzled. Fang Liang immediately explained to everyone. After he finished speaking, everyone’s expression changed.

Immortal Gods wanted to clean up the mortal world!

If this was not a calamity, then what was?

Han Jue said calmly, “I’m prepared to stop the immortals.”

Everyone looked at him in shock.

They all knew that Han Jue was very strong, but he was already strong enough to resist the Heavenly Court?

“It’s impossible for the Heavenly Court to send out all their forces. They will only send a portion of the Heavenly Troops. If I can stop them and let the Heavenly Court see my strength, I will use joining the Heavenly Court as a condition to exchange for peace in the world.” Han Jue chuckled.

He spoke casually, but his disciples could feel the pressure.

The Black Hell Chicken couldn’t help but say, “Master, you can already ascend. Why don’t you bring us along and run away?” It really felt that Han Jue didn’t have to fight to the death.

Han Jue smiled and said, “Let’s try. If we can’t block it, we can only run.” Tu Ling’er frowned. “Master can run. What should we do?”

“Don’t worry, I can ascend with this mountain.”

These words were true. The Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain had already become a Dao field that could isolate the Heavenly Dao. After they ascended, as long as they didn’t leave the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain, they wouldn’t be crushed to death by the Immortal Qi of the Immortal World.

The Three-Headed Wyrm King couldn’t help but curse. “They call themselves Immortal Gods? They want to clean up the entire mortal world because of suspicion? Why don’t they directly attack the devils? I don’t believe that the Heavenly Court can’t do it! I feel that this is just a superficial effort. Clearing up the demonic path in the mortal world means we are just sacrifices!”

He had played such tricks before.

When competing with the other Demon Kings for benefits, the other party might compromise and give him the benefits. However, he had to submit to the masses, so the other party would push out some demons to take the blame instead.

No matter what, it sounded wrong to clean up the mortal world directly.

After all, this mortal world was still dominated by the righteous path! The others also felt that Heavenly Court was too sinister.

The Chaotic Heavenly Dog looked at Chu Shiren and mocked. “If we give up cultivating, we’re doomed. We can only wait for the Heavenly Court to slaughter us.”

Chu Shiren frowned.

He was also feeling very uncomfortable.

It was indeed as the Chaotic Heavenly Dog said. If he gave up cultivating, forget about peace, the entire world would be gone. “Grandmaster, should we call Master and Senior Brother back?” Fang Liang asked.

Han Jue replied, “I already did.”

He had already informed Xun Chang’an and Murong Qi through the Six Paths Insignia. “Cultivate well. Try your best to carry my burden as soon as possible.” Han Jue smiled.

Everyone was ashamed.

At this point, everyone began to work hard and cultivate with all their might.

Chu Shiren seemed to have made up his mind and also started cultivating.

His talent stunned everyone. Even Han Jue was shocked.

In just a short year, he became a Golden Core!

This was cheating!

Han Jue couldn’t help but become curious. How strong was the Supreme Buddha? The five Great Buddhas were definitely existences stronger than the Divine General.

In the blink of an eye, another fourteen years passed.

Xun Chang’an and Murong Qi returned.

Murong Qi seemed to have transformed into a different person. He was full of dominance and had already surpassed the fifth level of the Body Integration Realm. As expected of the reincarnation of the Divine Palace War God.

Xun Chang’an was still so helplessly pathetic. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

It was worth mentioning that Chu Shiren was inexplicably close to Xun Chang’an and always chatted with him.

Xun Chang’an liked Chu Shiren very much. He spoke with this fellow disciple-nephew even more intimately than with his disciple.

He had no choice. After so many years, Murong Qi’s patience with him had long been worn out. He didn’t respect him at all and even often shouted at him.

Han Jue felt strange seeing them interact.

Xun Chang’an was only a natural treasure nurtured by the Buddhist Sect in his previous life, while Chu Shiren was the Supreme Buddha. Now, Xun Chang’an had become the Buddha’s martial uncle…

The relationship tree was in chaos!

Ever since Chu Shiren started cultivating, Yang Tiandong became arrogant.

Chu Shiren had already reached the Nascent Soul realm!

He had reached the Nascent Soul Realm in 14 years. Fang Liang and Murong Qi were inferior to him!

Fang Liang and Murong Qi were also shocked and cultivated even harder.

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

Han Jue taught Dao Comprehension Sword while cultivating.

Dao Comprehension Sword’s potential was also very strong. After all, she had obtained the Dao discussion comprehension of an Immortal God. Although she couldn’t compare to Chu Shiren, she was still much stronger than Yang Tiandong and the Black Hell Chicken.

(The Heavenly Emperor wants to send his son to the mortal world to deal with you. You have the following choices:]

(1: Immediately ascend and avoid fighting to the death with the Heavenly Court. You can obtain a random natural treasure.]

[2: Don’t ascend for the time being. Wait for the Heavenly Court to descend into the mortal world. You can obtain a Mystical Power inheritance and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.] Three lines of words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue. He was stunned.

Son of the Heavenly Emperor?

I can’t kill him!

It was fine to kill the Heavenly Troops since the Heavenly Emperor could replace them.

But if he killed his son, could he become the Heavenly Emperor’s son instead?

Han Jue frowned.

Should he immediately ascend?

No!

After ascending, Daoist Dan Qing, the Vermilion Bird, and a bunch of immortals might be waiting for him.

Besides, after cultivating for so many years, it was time to show off.

After cultivating quietly in a place no one cared about, he would appear out of thin air when everyone wasn’t paying attention to him and shock the world!

If he couldn’t win, he would escape!

Han Jue made a decision not to ascend.

[Congratulations on obtaining the Mystical Power-Destiny Sword Qi Great Wheel) (Destiny Sword Qi Great Wheel: Sword Dao Mystical Power, Karma Mystical Power. The sword Qi can create a karmic wheel. All things will be sucked in and their fate will be severed. Their bodies and souls will be destroyed completely.]

[Congratulations on obtaining a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.)

In a dark hall, the door suddenly opened, and a blinding golden light expelled the darkness.

The majestic Heavenly Emperor flew into the hall, his divine might spreading vastly.

A silver-armored man who was cultivating in the main hall opened his eyes.

He immediately stood up and knelt down to the Heavenly Emperor.

He looked so tiny in front of the Heavenly Emperor. However, there was a hint of arrogance between his brows. His entire aura was filled with confidence.

The Heavenly Emperor looked down at him and said, “Shan’er, the matter of the Demon Saint has come to an end. After the Heavenly Punishment is over, I want you to descend into the mortal world and clean it up. A prodigy has appeared in this world. He has probably reached the Heaven Immortal Realm. You have to do your best.”

This silver-armored man was called Long Shan, and he was the son of the Heavenly Emperor. His mother was from the True Dragon Race, and he had been cultivating in the Heavenly Court.

Long Shan asked in surprise, “Why didn’t he ascend with such a cultivation level?”

“An Immortal Emperor once threw a Heavenly Dao Stone into the mortal world, and it was obtained by him. Perhaps this child is related to that Immortal Emperor. Fight with your full strength. There’s no need to hold back.”

“Can I kill him?”

“Yes.”
