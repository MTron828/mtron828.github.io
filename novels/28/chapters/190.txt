Chapter 192 Powerful Divine Palace, Times Have Changed

Dao Comprehension Sword was disappointed when Chu Shiren brought Zhou Mingyue up the mountain.

Although he looked like a woman, his aura was that of a man.

Zhou Mingyue was very excited. He had finally obtained the recognition of an Immortal God!

He had been kneeling for more than twenty years!

How many decades could a person live?

The Black Hell Chicken, Tu Ling’er, the Three-Headed Wyrm King, and the others surrounded Zhou Mingyue and carefully sized him up.

To be taken in by Han Jue, he was definitely not a mortal!

Han Jue stood under the tree and didn’t pay attention to him.

Chu Shiren brought Zhou Mingyue to kneel down before him.

“From today onwards, he will be your disciple. You will teach him,” Han Jue said expressionlessly.

Upon hearing this, Chu Shiren was stunned.

Zhou Mingyue was also stunned. He hurriedly said, “I want to take you as my master. I don’t want this mortal as my master!”

Chu Shiren frowned.

The Black Hell Chicken smiled. “This mortal is already a Void Amalgamation Realm cultivator. Are you sure you don’t want to accept him?”

Zhou Mingyue widened his eyes and looked at Chu Shiren in disbelief.

The Void Amalgamation Realm was extremely far away for Golden Core Realm cultivators. He didn’t expect that the white-haired old man who looked like an ascetic was such an expert.

Wait!

If Chu Shiren was so strong, then…

Zhou Mingyue looked at Han Jue with a burning gaze. Han Jue said, “If you don’t want to, then leave the mountain.”

Zhou Mingyue was shocked and quickly agreed. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At this point, the first fourth-generation disciple of the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain appeared.

Han Jue ignored him and began to observe the Fusang Tree.

Chu Shiren pulled Zhou Mingyue away and began the Master-Disciple Ceremony.

Chu Shiren was still looking forward to Zhou Mingyue. After all, he was his first disciple.

After watering the Fusang Tree with immortal water, Han Jue returned to the Connate Cave Abode to continue cultivating.

He first improved his Sword Dao Mystical Power.

It had been a long time since he had come to the Sword Dao River. Han Jue missed Zhang Guxing a little.

This time, he didn’t reveal his cultivation level. Instead, he disguised it as a Heaven Immortal.

Zhang Guxing was suspected to be related to the Divine Palace, and it wasn’t on good terms with the Heavenly Court. Now, Han Jue couldn’t casually show his cultivation to him. What if he was stabbed in the back?

Seeing Zhang Guxing again, Han Jue smiled and greeted him.

Zhang Guxing asked, “You joined the Heavenly Court?”

So direct?

Han Jue said, “Not really. I haven’t entered the Heavenly Court yet. I’m still in the mortal world.”

“What do you mean? You don’t plan to ascend? Since the Heavenly Emperor didn’t clean up the mortal world, that means that he has already acknowledged you. Why did you give up this opportunity?”

“I just feel that the Heavenly Court’s situation is troublesome and the Upper World is dangerous. I want to stay in the mortal world to cultivate and stay away from trouble.” “If you keep evading it, it’s impossible for you to become an Immortal Emperor. You might be able to become a Golden Immortal through cultivation alone, but if you want to become an Immortal Emperor, you have to experience the mortal world and fight for providence. Only then can you become an Immortal Emperor. By then, as long as a trace of your soul remains, even the cycle of reincarnation can’t erase you.”

Zhang Guxing was very serious.

Han Jue smiled and said, “Then, I’ll wait until I reach the Golden Immortal Realm.”

His potential was top-notch and he cultivated an Immortal Emperor cultivation technique. There was really no need for him to cause trouble everywhere.

If he became the stepping stone of some protagonist, wouldn’t all his efforts be in vain?

Just the Scarlet Cloud World had so many heaven-defying figures, let alone the thousands of other mortal worlds. The Upper World was even more terrifying than imagined.

Even the powerful Heavenly Emperor didn’t dare to act recklessly in the Heavenly Court. Han Jue felt that he himself was smart, but he was not completely unscrupulous in his calculations and schemes.

Instead of going to the Heavenly Court and competing with the rest, it was better to cultivate in the mortal world in peace and not threaten anyone.

Zhang Guxing shook his head and laughed. He suddenly thought of something and said, “Although the matter of the Demon Saint wreaking havoc in the Heavenly Court has ended, there might be a change soon. The Demon Saint is the Great Sage of the Demon Race, having led a million demon soldiers to fight a bloody battle. In the end, the ones who benefited were the Buddhists. This made the Demon Race and the Demon Court very dissatisfied. There might be a huge change in the Upper World.”

Was this not over?

Han Jue teased, “Could it be that the Buddhist Sect is planning to let the people of the Demon Court and Heavenly Court participate in the journey to the west and set up many obstacles along the way, using the travelers to slay demons and devils and promote the greatness of the Buddhist Sect?”.

Zhang Guxing asked in surprise, “Are you really a mortal without a prominent previous life?”

Han Jue was stunned. Did he guess correctly?

Eh?

Journey to the West was not fabricated? “A long time ago, the Buddhist Sect indeed had such a grand plan, and they succeeded. That’s why they are so powerful today. The Dao Sect also retired because of this. However, later on, the five Great Buddhas had a disagreement and even fought, causing the Buddhist Sect to weaken drastically. This also gave the Divine Palace a chance to rise.

“The Divine Palace is the fastest rising power in the Upper World. It’s also the force with the most Immortal Emperors.”

Han Jue was shocked.

The force with the greatest number of Immortal Emperors?

Crap!

Am I on the wrong side?

It seemed that the Divine Palace had a better future!

However, Murong Qi had a grudge against the Divine Palace. Even if he went there, he might not be treated so well.

I can’t think like that.

I need to cherish what I have! Han Jue adjusted his state of mind.

The two of them chatted for a while more before he bid farewell and left.

In the following year, Han Jue came to the Sword Dao River several times as if he was visiting home.

Seven years later.

Daoist Nine Cauldrons came to visit him. Several decades had passed since the Immortal God Calamity. Although the world was no longer in a heated discussion, everyone still remembered this matter, especially in the cultivation world. The Jade Pure Sacred Sect had been deified because of Han Jue.

In the past few years, the Jade Pure Sacred Sect had rapidly expanded. Daoist Nine Cauldrons, Liu Bumie, Huang Zuntian, and the other upper echelons of the sect were busy. “What is it?” Han Jue asked with a smile.

Daoist Nine Cauldrons was already a Body Integration Realm cultivator, but he was clearly very nervous when facing Han Jue.

This was a terrifying mighty figure that even an Immortal God couldn’t defeat!

To put it bluntly, Han Jue was the Jade Pure Sacred Sect’s ancestor. If the sect cultivators were asked to choose between the two of them, no one would choose him.

Han Jue was already the faith of the cultivators in the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.

“Do you remember Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou?” Daoist Nine Cauldrons asked.

Han Jue nodded.

Daoist Nine Cauldrons continued, “These two met again and even fought with many Holy Lands. They offended more and more people. Some people even invited our sect to besiege them. Do you think…”

Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou were some of Han Jue’s few good friends. Daoist Nine Cauldrons knew about them, so he specially came to ask him.

Han Jue replied, “Do as you deem fit. After so many years, they’re no longer disciples of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. Don’t always think that they are related to me. If they act recklessly and are really evil, we should eliminate them.”

After a thousand years, many things had changed.

People changed every few years, let alone a thousand years.

Although their favorability towards Han Jue didn’t decrease, he didn’t owe them anything.

Everyone had their own life. Han Jue didn’t want to care too much unless he had a karmic debt to them.

“I understand.”

Daoist Nine Cauldrons replied and told him about the situation of the sect. Han Jue didn’t want to be in charge and didn’t give any opinion.

After he left, Han Jue took out the Heavenly Dao Token, wanting to see what Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou were up to recently.

Soon, his expression changed.

These two…
