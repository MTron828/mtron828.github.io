Chapter 195 Guanyin Scripture, Heavenly Peach Banquet

Han Jue noticed that Xing Hongxuan had obtained the inheritance of an ancient mighty figure and her soul had also transformed.

He turned his attention to her.

Xing Hongxuan was still in the Daoist temple she had bumped into by chance. Previously, Chang Yue’er had accompanied her. Now, she was alone. Chang Yue’er wasn’t as daring as she was. It was fine if she went out occasionally.

Han Jue had discovered a remnant soul in the statue. It had already awakened.

It was an old woman in a Daoist robe. She looked different from those he had seen before. She floated above Xing Hongxuan’s head and chanted the scriptures.

Han Jue listened quietly and felt that something was amiss.

Why is it a Buddhist scripture?

A Buddhist lecture in a Daoist temple? What’s going on?

Han Jue checked Xing Hongxuan’s profile picture in his interpersonal relationships. After confirming that she wasn’t possessed and that her favorability didn’t decrease, he was relieved.

He used his divine sense to probe the remnant soul.

Grand Unity Heaven Immortal cultivation!

However, it was only the realm. Her strength might not even be comparable to a Loose Immortal, and the soul was already a flickering candle in the wind.

Han Jue continued to observe.

After a long time.

Xing Hongxuan opened her eyes and said, “Master, can this Guanyin Scripture really allow me to become an immortal?”

The old woman said, “Of course. Buddhism emphasizes that all living beings are equal. Anyone with any talent can become Buddha or Bodhisattva. As long as you have a firm Buddhist heart, this is your only way. Your potential is indeed mediocre. The cultivation techniques of the mortal world can’t help you. “I don’t have much time left. I’ll even give you my remnant soul. Don’t forget what you promised me.”

With that said, the old woman’s remnant soul gradually dissipated like smoke.

Xing Hongxuan wasn’t sad. Instead, she was very calm.

Han Jue suddenly appeared in front of her.

“Husband!” Xing Hongxuan exclaimed in surprise and hurriedly stood up.

In the current Scarlet Cloud World, Han Jue could go wherever he wanted because he was the Immortal God in charge of the Heavenly Dao.

“Who was that just now?” Han Jue asked. Xing Hongxuan replied, “A Buddhist cultivator from the Upper World descended into the mortal world a long time ago. She died and her Dao dissipated, leaving behind only a remnant soul. She gave her cultivation technique to me, hoping that after I ascend, I can help her tell the Buddhist Sect about her grudge and let them seek justice for her.”

Han Jue asked curiously, “What grudge?”

Xing Hongxuan didn’t hide anything and replied truthfully, “A long time ago, the Heavenly Tribulation affected the mortal world. She joined forces with the Heavenly Court’s Immortal Gods to come to the mortal world to clean up the Devil Race. In the end, she was betrayed by the Immortal Gods.”

It concerned the Heavenly Court?

Han Jue didn’t think too much about it. When Xing Hongxuan arrived at the Buddhist Sect, who knew if it would be thousands of years or tens of thousands of years later.

“How are you?” Han Jue asked. He grabbed Xing Hongxuan’s wrist and checked her body.

Her spirit energy was stable, and there was no danger in her body.

Xing Hongxuan smiled and said, “It’s fine. This Guanyin Scripture is indeed powerful. Husband, do you want it? You can let your female disciples cultivate it in the future.”

Han Jue hesitated and said, “That’s not good. Didn’t she tell you not to spread the technique?”

“She did, but she’s already gone. Besides, everything I have belongs to my husband. I’ll follow the agreement and tell the Buddhist Sect about her hatred.”

“Alright, let me check if this cultivation technique is dangerous,” Han Jue replied. In all kinds of fantasy novels, Buddhism was the most hated.

It was as if all Buddhas were hypocrites and liked to brainwash others.

Xing Hongxuan immediately taught him the Guanyin Scripture.

There were no records of this cultivation technique. It was passed down verbally.

Han Jue started to sort it out. 113.185.41.163

The Guanyin Scripture was indeed impressive. It could actually be cultivated to the Grand Unity True Immortal realm. If mastered, one could cultivate the Guanyin Dharma Body and have unparalleled divine powers.

Han Jue combed through it repeatedly but didn’t find any traps.

“Continue cultivating.”

Han Jue opened his eyes and said before leaving

Xing Hongxuan was already used to his straightforward personality.

She meditated again and continued cultivating

Han Jue smiled after returning to the Connate Cave Abode.

Xing Hongxuan also had her own fortuitous encounter. She probably wouldn’t die of old age. This was also good. It won’t make Han Jue worry.

Currently, the people around him were all very old. As long as they were willing to stay in the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain to cultivate, there would be no problem with their lifespan limit.

Ever since the Fusang Tree was watered with the immortal water, the Spirit Qi of the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain had increased greatly.

He continued to cultivate.

After another eleven years, he finally broke through to the mid-stage of the Reincarnation True Immortal Realm.

His Dharmic powers increased again!

Han Jue was in a good mood.

He liked the feeling of breaking through. He was even more glad now that he had spent more than ten years rerolling his providences and cultivation potential.

He had persevered for more than ten years in exchange for a lifetime of comfort! Han Jue became more cautious and continued cultivating. His target was the late-stage True Immortal Realm!

Another three years passed.

Di Taibai personally visited. Han Jue invited him into the cave abode.

It had to be said that the high officials of the Heavenly Court were indeed impressive. They could casually descend into the mortal world. If it were other immortals, they would be violating the heavenly rules.

After Dao Comprehension Sword was chased out, Di Taibai sat before the table and smiled. “I heard that you’re already a True Immortal?”

Clearly, the Heavenly Emperor had already heard about Long Shan’s retreat.

“Yes, I was lucky,” Han Jue said humbly.

Di Taibai stroked his beard and smiled. “As expected of a prodigy personally chosen by His Majesty. You don’t have to worry about the Undying Emperor anymore. The Divine General has already killed him. Although he isn’t dead, it will be very difficult for him to cause trouble in the next million years.”

A million years was enough for him to rise! Han Jue said, “Thank you, Heavenly Court. Thank you, Heavenly Emperor. Thank you, Divine General!”

“The Heavenly Peach Banquet, which happens once every ten thousand years, is about to begin. There’s still a hundred years to go. Do you want to go? If you do, I’ll give you an invitation.”

Han Jue thought for a moment and then said, “Forget it. I’m afraid of trouble.”

Di Taibai smiled. “What trouble is there in the Heavenly Peach Banquet? Don’t worry, your identity won’t be made public. His Majesty won’t mention you, either. You’re just going to enjoy the heavenly peaches and see how impressive the Heavenly Court is.”

Han Jue hesitated for a moment and asked, “Is it the Heavenly Emperor’s intention?”

“Yes, consuming one peach is better than a thousand years of cultivation. Are you willing to give it up?”

“Alright, I’ll go.” Since it was the Heavenly Emperor’s intention, he wouldn’t be giving him face by rejecting.

Moreover, the Heavenly Emperor made the Divine General kill the Undying Emperor. It was a huge favor.

The Heavenly Court had been helping him until now, but he hadn’t done anything for them.

Di Taibai smiled and said, “There’s a reincarnated Immortal Emperor in the Divine Palace who has awakened the Emperor Dao. When he was a Grand Unity True Immortal, he killed a Grand Unity Golden Immortal. Now, he’s already a Grand Unity Golden Immortal and is very awe-inspiring. He has been conferred the title of the strongest prodigy of the younger generation by the Divine Palace. You have to cultivate well. In the future, you will definitely have to face him. You will represent the Heavenly Court.” Han Jue frowned after hearing that.

So impressive? He was about to say something when Di Taibai vanished.

A red token appeared on the table with the words “Heavenly Peach” carved on it. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The Heavenly Peach Banquet in a hundred years?”

Han Jue silently wondered if the heavenly peach was fragrant.

Then, he took out the Heavenly Dao Token and sent his divine sense into it to check the Heavenly Dao Tablet.

He was shocked when he saw it!

The Scarlet Cloud World’s ranking had actually improved by hundreds!
