Chapter 945 Strange Calamity

“Who are you? What do you want?” Jiang Jueshi asked in a low voice. His left hand behind his waist clenched into a fist. The power of creation was already accumulating.

Carefree Immortal looked down at them and smiled. “Han Huang, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s son. You were born as Freedom which is unprecedented. Impressive, truly impressive. You will dominate the Chaos if there are no accidents.”

Han Huang glared at him and did not say anything

Carefree Immortal looked at Jiang Jueshi next. “You were born with great opportunities. You have stepped onto a Supreme Road that no one has walked before. Your fate is also an invincible path.

“The two of you are both invincible, but you walk side by side. One of you will die sooner or later.

“The person standing above the two of you is also invincible. It’s not good for three invincible paths to meet.”

Han Huang laughed in anger and cursed. “Such lies. So you trapped us to deal with my father? You really overestimate yourself. If not for that Supreme Treasure, you would definitely not be my match. You still want to be enemies with my father with such strength?”

Han Qing’er nodded and mocked.

Jiang Jueshi did not say anything. He waited solemnly and was prepared to attack at any time.

Carefree Immortal smiled. “You’re still young and can’t understand my words, but you have to understand that since ancient times, there has only been one strongest person. Pangu, the Dao Ancestor, the Primordial Ancestor God, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, and now the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. Do you think he can continue being the strongest? Don’t you want to sit on this throne?”

He raised his hands. In an instant, the sky above the forest changed. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled. Terrifying illusions appeared between the thunderclouds.

Han Huang and the other two were nervous, not knowing what this fellow wanted to do.

A half-moon red jade flew out from above the Carefree Immortal’s head. It spun at high speed and refracted thousands of lights that illuminated the world.

“It’s here! It’s that thing again!”

Han Huang cursed helplessly.

The Carefree Immortal revealed a strange smile. The half-moon red jade suddenly shattered and the sky suddenly collapsed. The ten-thousand-foot-tall forest turned into dust. Han Huang and the other two felt their consciousness suffer a heavy blow and everything fell into darkness.

Immortal World, in a city of humans.

Han Jue, who had retracted his Dharma treasure, was listening to an old Daoist talk about the grand occasion of the Hidden Sect Meeting.

The current Immortal World was filled with the trend of cultivation. All the major events in the Heavenly Dao would spread. Occasionally, one could even hear some news about the Chaos.

It was not easy for him to come out, so Han Jue naturally had to relax.

He had already traveled the Immortal World for decades and had seen too many interesting things.

At this moment, Han Jue suddenly felt something and frowned.

His bloodline throbbed!

Something had happened to his son!

Han Jue couldn’t help but deduce and discovered that Han Huang, Han Qing’er, and Jiang Jueshi were missing. He couldn’t deduce it even with his cultivation.

How strange!

Han Jue had no choice but to use the derivation function.

“I want to know where Han Huang and the other two are now?”

(Unable to derive karma]

Han Jue frowned. He checked his interpersonal relationships and discovered that the portraits of the three of them were still there.

Since they were still there, how could he not have deduced it?

Was there something in the Chaos that he could not predict?

“The blank domain has no karma. The system can’t derive it, right?”

(Yes]

This word made Han Jue’s heart sink.

Ordinary living beings could not enter the blank domain!

Could it be that the three of them were attacked?

He checked the emails.

(Your son Han Huang was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.]

[Your daughter…)

The three of them were all severely injured!

Han Jue asked in his mind, “I want to know who attacked Han Huang.”

(The other party has an Ultimate Dao Treasure that cannot be deduced.]

Han Jue showed a frown.

His Ultimate Mortal Robe was an Ultimate Dao Treasure that could defend against a blow from a Dao Creator!

In other words, an Ultimate Dao Treasure was already equivalent to the power of a Dao Creator.

Could it be that a Dao Creator had attacked?

No, he could even deduce the Ninth Chaos.

The other party was at least not the Ninth Chaos, the Chaotic Consciousness, and the Formless Transcendent Deity. Could it be one of the other two mysterious Dao Creators?

Han Jue kept asking in his mind, wanting to find a flaw.

However, he could not derive the other party’s karma no matter how he asked.

Helpless, he could only wait.

If the other party really wanted to kill Han Huang and the other two, they should already be dead. How could they pester him when the other party wielded an Ultimate Dao Treasure?

Han Jue was no longer in the mood to listen to the Daoist. He was about to stand up and leave when a six or seven-year-old child suddenly sat down in front of him.

The child ignored Han Jue and picked up the food on the table to eat.

Han Jue didn’t stop him and only stared at him quietly.

After a long time.

The child was full and his mouth was covered in oil. He looked sloppy.

He looked at Han Jue and said, “Anomaly. If you’re too sharp, disaster will arrive.”

Han Jue smiled and asked, “What anomaly?”

The child picked up a jar of wine and started drinking. This jar of wine was larger than his upper body and looked quite strange.

Han Jue was not in a hurry and waited patiently.

After taking a sip of wine, the child’s face turned red. He put down the wine jar and looked at Han Jue with drunken eyes. He smiled and said, “You are an anomaly. You shouldn’t exist. Your appearance has disrupted everything in the Heavenly Dao and broken the inherent situation of the Chaos. You have already threatened the Chaos. Trouble is coming.”

“Oh? What trouble is it?” Han Jue supported his chin with his right hand and asked with interest.

The child’s voice was loud, but the surrounding customers did not seem to hear him. No one paid attention to them.

The child grinned. “Everything you care about will devour you. The more you like it now, the more hatred you will attract in the future.”

“I’ve encountered it before. Junior, the next is your most important calamity. You might be able to see the entire Chaos, but you might not be able to see through its essence.”

Han Jue retracted his smile and asked, “Dao Ancestor?”

The child stood up and left. He waved his hand and said, “Dao Ancestor? That’s only a name given to me by all living beings. When all living beings don’t need the Dao Ancestor, he naturally won’t exist.”

Han Jue watched the child leave.

He could sense that this child was only a mortal that did not have any special fate. He was probably possessed by the Dao Ancestor’s will.

The Dao Ancestor was indeed hidden in the Heavenly Dao.

He encountered the Dao Ancestor just as something happened to Han Huang and the other two. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Too strange!

Han Jue didn’t leave and asked in his mind, “What calamity is the Dao Ancestor talking about?”

[100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

Han Jue’s consciousness fell into the illusion.

He opened his eyes and discovered that he was standing on the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.

Countless figures floated in the sky as far as the eye could see. They were all Hidden Sect disciples. A majestic tree connected the world at the end of the horizon of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.

Fusang Tree!

Han Jue’s gaze swept over. He saw Han Huang, Han Tuo, Xing Hongxuan, Yang Tiandong, Jiang Jueshi, Dao Sovereign, and so on. All his relatives and disciples looked at him with hatred.

Han Jue turned around and saw a figure standing behind him. It was himself.

His future self wore a Supreme Treasure and looked indifferently at the disciples surrounding him
