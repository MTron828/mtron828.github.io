Chapter 1038 Mystic Ancestor, Ancient Ultimate God

Shi Tian, on a desolate continent covered in blood.

The ground shattered and the sky tore apart. Space-time cracks were like countless huge centipedes that occupied it, looking sinister and terrifying

A ten-million-feet-tall mighty figure stood on the ground. His body was surrounded by dragon-like nebulous Primordial Qi. His long hair fluttered wildly and his figure was burly. His armor was stretched until cracks appeared.

It was Han Huang.

He had already used the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s main body. His aura was like a rainbow as he looked down at the terrifying figures in the distance.

Ten Great Dao Supremes and more than a hundred Great Dao Sages were scattered in all directions, trapping Han Huang here. This continent had already been set up with an array formation to isolate the void.

“Han Huang, today is the day you die!”

“Eternal Peak of the Chaos? It’s indeed impressive. Unfortunately, you will die here!”

“Why are you talking nonsense with him? If the Mystic Ancestor makes a move, we have to hurry up!” “Hahaha, killing Han Huang is equivalent to cutting off an arm of the Chaos!”

“I should be careful. This fellow’s aura is becoming stronger again!”

Han Huang smiled sinisterly and crazily upon hearing the voices coming from all directions.

He was extremely excited as he sensed the endless mysterious power in his body.

“So this is the power of the Primordial Fiendcelestial! With this power, I’m invincible!”

Han Huang roared in his heart, his eyes filled with killing intent.

He slowly raised his right hand and a purple blade of light appeared in front of him. It was Han Jue’s Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion, but the color was different.

Han Huang smiled disdainfully. “You thieves, I’ll let you see the power of the Primordial Fiendcelestial!”

Primordial Fiendcelestial!

The mighty figures of Shi Tian were in an uproar. The legend of the Primordial Fiendcelestial had also spread in Shi Tian. In addition to the fusion of the Chaos and Shi Tian, the Primordial Fiendcelestial had become a hotly discussed name because of the Chaos.

Han Huang had the power of the Primordial Fiendcelestial?

Impossible!

Han Huang laughed wantonly and suddenly waved his hand. Purple Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion shot out and swept through the hundred Great Dao Sages in the sky.

The Great Dao Sages attacked one after another, while the Great Dao Supremes attacked Han Huang.

Han Huang was fearless and extremely excited. Dharma Idols condensed on his body as he lept. He waved his palm in all directions and kept using the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.

Boom! Boom! Boom…

The world collapsed. The River of Destiny hidden in the sky appeared and twisted wantonly, ready to be destroyed at any time.

Han Huang grabbed a Great Dao Sage and crushed the Great Dao runes around him, crushing his body into dust. Such was his power.

Swish!

A huge black sword suddenly stabbed into Han Huang’s back. Endless lightning burst out and interwove around him, destroying him crazily. Even his soul was injured.

Han Huang frowned and turned around. A Ghost Head Daoist was casting a spell in the sky. Behind him was a netherworld-like scene of hell.

Han Huang’s killing intent erupted. His eyes narrowed as the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion condensed again and charged in front of Daoist Ghost Head. Before he could react, he was obliterated by the Ultimate Origin Soul. Even his body and soul were destroyed.

The battle did not stop because of this. The other mighty figures kept attacking.

A Great Dao Supreme held a long sword and slashed a crack in the sky. A flowing river appeared in the crack. It was billions of kilometers wide, as if the sky was collapsing.

Han Huang looked up and felt several Great Dao auras. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Great Dao River? Interesting!”

Han Huang thought of the Mystical Power that Dao Sovereign had used in the Chaotic Assembly.

At this moment, a terrifying figure suddenly rose from the Great Dao River. Only his upper body was revealed. He wore broken ancient bronze armor and had four arms. His face was like dead wood. Only his eyes were empty and lonely. There were countless divine weapons above his head, like an ancient god who had revived from the ancient battlefield.

“Primordial Fiendcelestial? I’ll let you experience the power of the oldest Chaotic Fiendcelestial first!”

The Great Dao Supreme stood above the Great Dao River and laughed wantonly.

“Remember his name, Ancient Ultimate God!”

With that said, the Ancient Ultimate God struggled out of the Great Dao River and swooped down at Han Huang.

Han Huang was about to resist when a mysterious and powerful force suddenly bound him, preventing him from moving.

Crap!

Han Huang was moved.

Boom

The ground shattered and dust flew. The barrier in the sky shattered and the endless dark void devoured everything.

On the other side.

In the third Dao Field.

Han Jue was watching the battle with relish.

Shi Tian’s lineup was very strong. Most of the mighty figures guarding Shi Tian had come only to besiege Han Huang.

The strongest was that Mystic Ancestor, right? He imprisoned Han Huang in the void, causing him to be suppressed by the Ancient Ultimate God.

The Mystic Ancestor was very strong, even stronger than Laozi. The Ultimate God of Punishment was probably not his match one-on-one.

It had to be said that Shi Tian’s high-end combat strength was still very strong.

“However, it’s not so easy to kill my son.”

Han Jue smiled and began to increase the Ultimate Origin Power he sent to Han Huang.

Lil’ brat!

I want to see how much you can withstand!

Boom

In the abyss-like battlefield.

The violent Ultimate Origin Power dispersed the dust storm that covered the sky and pushed the majestic Ancient Ultimate God into the void.

“Nonsense. It’s nothing much even if you join forces!”

Han Huang’s wild laughter sounded. The endless dust storm was dispersed and vanished. The entire battlefield completely turned into a void. The previous vast continent had already disappeared, leaving not a single stone behind.

Two waves of Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion appeared around Han Huang and stepped on the Ancient Ultimate God with endless divine might.

The Great Dao Supreme who had summoned the Great Dao River said angrily, “Don’t be arrogant!”

The Great Dao River quickly flowed and surrounded Han Huang. Ancient Ultimate Gods crawled out of the river like demons breaking free from their cages.

“Enough!”

A dignified voice descended. A white-robed Daoist sitting on a green lotus throne slowly landed. Resplendent divine light lit up behind him, illuminating the void.

Han Huang frowned. It was this fellow again!

If not for the Mystic Ancestor, these dogs wouldn’t be his match at all!

He could sense that the Mystic Ancestor had grasped the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. He could be said to still remember

it.

The Master of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority in front of him was the strongest existence he had ever encountered.

Mystic Ancestor had a benevolent expression. His eyes were closed and his skin was as white as jade. He was like a statue.

“Leave your power behind and I can let you live.”

The Mystic Ancestor’s voice was extremely dignified and irrefutable.

Han Huang couldn’t be bothered to talk nonsense with him. He controlled the two streams of Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion to attack.

How fast was the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion? Before the afterimage disappeared, it had already arrived on both sides of the Mystic Ancestor, wanting to crush him.

However, the Ultimate Origin Soul passed through the Mystic Ancestor’s body harmlessly. He was not injured at all.

Han Huang frowned. Could it be that this was not his main body?

The Mystic Ancestor said, “No power in this world can hurt me, even if it’s the Supreme Rules…”

Cracks suddenly appeared on his body before he could finish speaking, causing him to open his eyes.

“Impossible…

“What power is this?”

Mystic Ancestor was moved and immediately suppressed the remaining Ultimate Origin Power coursing through his body.
