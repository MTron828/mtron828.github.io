Chapter 816 Ultimate Cultivation Technique, Innate Great Creation

Outside the 33rd Heaven, in the Universal Hall.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, who was preaching, suddenly stopped. Tens of thousands of listeners opened their eyes.

“Eh? What aura is this?”

“Someone obtained the Zenith Heaven Dao Fruit?”

“Why is the Zenith Heaven Dao Fruit causing such a huge commotion?”

“No, it’s not only Zenith Heaven!”

“Why can’t I deduce this person’s providence?”

The Dao Seekers discussed. Their cultivation levels were not low. They could see Jiang Jueshi who was breaking through at a glance, but they could not deduce his past.

A Dao Seeker looked at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and asked, “May I ask who this person is?”

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Speaking of which, this person has a relationship with our Human School. His name is Jiang Jueshi. He once joined the Human School with his younger brother, Jiang Dugu. For some reason, this person left the Human School and died in the world.”

He was puzzled. He did not recognize Jiang Jueshi before, but now, he realized that he was not simple.

Although he was only two thousand years old in this life, it was a long time ago.

Most importantly, he actually could not understand why Jiang Jueshi could reach the Zenith Heaven Realm in a day and still want to continue breaking through.

Wasn’t this the top prodigy that Fellow Daoist Han wanted?

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had the intention to recruit him.

Not only the Universal Hall, but the other Sage Dao Fields were also discussing Jiang Jueshi.

Jiang Jueshi could be said to have endured for a trillion years and shocked the world!

All the Sages were like Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. They didn’t know Jiang Jueshi, but they all wanted to subdue him now!

What a prodigy!

There had never been such a huge breakthrough since ancient times!

No one disturbed Jiang Jueshi.

Ten days later.

Jiang Jueshi broke through to the Pseudo-Sage Realm in one go, but he did not stop!

The entire Immortal World was affected by him. The Spirit Qi far away even began to thin. It was obvious how exaggerated Jiang Jueshi’s breakthrough was.

Han Jue was also paying attention to him.

Could it be that this child had grasped the Great Dao?

No!

There was no Great Dao power!

was n

It was a cultivation technique!

What cultivation technique was so powerful?

Cultivation techniques became unimportant after attaining the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit. Sages only comprehended the Great Dao. This was the first time Han Jue saw such a cultivation technique.

“I want to know what cultivation technique Jiang Jueshi cultivates?”

(500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

This was already comparable to the Great Dao Supreme Realm!

Moved, Han Jue chose to continue.

[Great Reincarnation Creation Technique: Ultimate cultivation technique. It was comprehended by Jiang Jueshi when he comprehended the creation of the Heavenly Dao. After experiencing ten thousand reincarnations, he can constantly compress his cultivation and increase his potential. There is no end to it.]

Ultimate cultivation technique!

Han Jue was secretly shocked. So impressive?

He couldn’t help but ask, “Why can Jiang Jueshi comprehend such a cultivation technique?”

(3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[The fate of creation is indescribable. The Chaotic Consciousness, Pangu, the Dao Ancestor, Jiang Jueshi, and the others all have the potential of the Great Creation.)

Unable to understand, Han Jue could only attribute it to his potential.

This kid was impressive.

He was actually comparable to the Chaotic Consciousness, Pangu, and the Dao Ancestor!

Several months later.

Jiang Jueshi used his strength to attain the Dao and directly attained the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit, shocking the world. A huge amount of Heavenly Dao providence surged into his body and the endless sea stirred up a storm.

At this moment, a line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.

(Detected bearer of Connate providence, check its origin.)

Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

He immediately chose to check.

(Jiang Jueshi: Early-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, Innate Great Creation. Heavenly Dao Great Emperor, Life and Death Great Emperor, Reincarnation Great Emperor, Ultimate Creator. Because you have accompanied him, he has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 5 stars]

Han Jue was moved.

This fellow actually kept growing into a peerless prodigy that shocked the system under his watch!

Amazing!

This series of providence was clearly not simple. It was not there before!

After attaining the Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm, Jiang Jueshi’s breakthrough finally ended. The Spirit Qi no longer gathered towards him.

Something that shocked the Sages happened!

Jiang Jueshi was not expelled from the Immortal World by the Heavenly Dao!

Impossible!

He was not a Heavenly Dao Sage. Even if he was, he should be expelled to the 33rd Heaven and stay away from all living beings!

At the peak of the mountain, Jiang Jueshi slowly opened his eyes.

A purple wheel floated above his head. It was larger than the entire island and spun on its own. It was dazzling.

Jiang Jueshi looked at his hands and smiled.

He had finally succeeded after countless years of cultivation!

There were not many existences older than him in the current Heavenly Dao. Some Sages could even be considered his juniors.

“Heaven does not let down those who work hard. From now on, I will have no limits,” Jiang Jueshi muttered to himself as he stood up.

With a thought, he swept through the myriad worlds!

All living beings entered his eyes!

For some reason, Jiang Jueshi thought of the old Daoist who had sacrificed himself to enlighten him.

There was no surprise in his heart, only endless regret.

He couldn’t find the old Daoist’s soul. Even if providence was connected to the Heavenly Dao.

It seemed that he had really sacrificed himself. His body and soul had been destroyed.

Jiang Jueshi’s eyes became firm.

“Since Sages can’t, I’ll surpass them!”

Jiang Jueshi looked up at the sky and transformed into a purple rainbow that soared into the sky. He pierced through the 33rd Heaven and arrived at the peak of the Heavenly Dao.

He looked down and closed his eyes, quietly sensing his cultivation.

At this moment, figures appeared nearby. They were the Heavenly Dao Sages.

Li Taigu smiled and said, “Fellow Daoist is really powerful. You attained the Dao in one day. It’s unprecedented!”

Yang Che smiled strangely. “This potential probably surpasses the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.”

With that said, he felt many dissatisfied gazes and hurriedly shut up.

Damn it!

Are you all the dogs of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage? I’m just casually praising someone and you’re already anxious?

Yang Che was indignant. He was clearly working hard, but he could not integrate into the circle of Sages.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du also appeared. He stared at Jiang Jueshi and smiled. “I didn’t expect the Human School to produce such a prodigy. It’s the fortune of the Human School.”

Jiang Jueshi opened his eyes and glanced at him. “I’ve long become unrelated to the Human School and the Heavenly Dao. Don’t worry. I won’t stay even though I can enter the Immortal World. I’m leaving to continue pursuing the Great Dao.”

With that, he turned around and left without any hesitation.

The Sages were stunned. He left just like that?

“Aren’t you going to repay the Heavenly Dao’s kindness?” Heavenly Venerate Wufa snorted.

Jiang Jueshi stopped and said, “I will definitely return if the Heavenly Dao is in trouble in the future.”

Ji Xianshen said, “Tian Zhan, test his cultivation.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

With that, the new sage immediately flew towards Jiang Jueshi.

Jiang Jueshi did not even turn his head as he said, “Go out and fight, lest you alarm all living beings. All of you can attack. Let me see my current strength!”

His tone was calm, but his words were extremely arrogant.

Han Jue, who was in the Daoist temple, suddenly frowned.

Why had this fellow’s temperament changed drastically?

He had gone astray!

This was not stable enough!

Jiang Jueshi and Tian Zhan arrived at the Dark Forbidden Zone. Facing each other, Tian Zhan was the first to attack. He slapped out with both hands, and his Dharmic powers transformed into the figures of countless Heavenly Race’s Heavenly Soldiers. They swept through the Dark Forbidden Zone in a mighty manner.

Jiang Jueshi waved his sleeve and dispersed all his Dharmic powers.

His left hand formed a seal and he slapped forward. The purple wheel shot out and almost instantly passed through space to arrive above Tian Zhan’s head.
