Chapter 810 Attention of the Chaotic Consciousness

“Those who only have their clones here, send your main bodies immediately. Kill Pangu in one battle and let him know that his era has passed!”

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial scanned all the Fiendcelestials and said seriously.

Han Jue felt that this fellow was talking about him.

In this palace, only a few Chaotic Fiendcelestials had sent clones. The others were all their main bodies. They were also afraid that their main bodies would be killed by Pangu if they stayed in their hometown.

Just like that, the Fiendcelestials flew out of the palace under the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s lead.

Han Jue would take advantage of the situation to see Pangu’s strength.

Ten thousand years later.

Han Jue came to the second Dao Field and released the Thunderbolt Fiendcelestial to let Murong Qi receive him.

Murong Qi was extremely happy to have another Fiendcelestial companion.

Han Jue looked at the second Dao Field after the two of them left.

“All these years, the Fiendcelestials have been very impatient. They all feel Pangu’s threat,” Li Yao said softly.

She also felt it. Not only that, but Pangu’s name burst out from her bloodline and surged into her mind, letting her know the reason.

Han Jue asked, “Has it been soothed?”

Li Yao nodded. “It’s all thanks to Murong Qi. I have to say that your grand-disciple is indeed very talented.”

Han Jue smiled. Of course. He valued Murong Qi the most!

Dao Comprehension Sword asked, “Master, will Pangu find us?”

Han Jue said, “Yes, but he can’t enter.”

Pangu clearly had the ability to track the Fiendcelestials. He could sense its direction even if he couldn’t spy on the second Dao Field. This was a resonance between the Fiendcelestials.

Dao Comprehension Sword was curious. She was already curious about the array formation of the Dao Field, but she did not dare to ask.

Li Yao smiled. “Don’t worry. Even if the sky falls, Sect Master will hold it up. Pangu is not our enemy. Our enemy is still in the future.”

Most of the Fiendcelestials had already entered the Sage Realm, but they had yet to reach the Freedom Realm.

“That’s right. You have to at least reach the Great Dao Sage Realm before you can serve me.” Han Jue smiled. Unfortunately, he didn’t have a beard. Otherwise, it would be so cool to stroke it and smile.

Of course, he could also grow a beard himself.

Han Jue chatted with the two women for a while before returning to the main Dao Field.

He checked the emails.

(Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage has stepped into the Sword Dao and comprehended its true meaning.)

(Your son Han Tuo has stepped into the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm. His cultivation has increased greatly.)

(Your good friend Yi Tian has stepped into the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm. His cultivation has increased greatly.)

(Your disciple Dao Sovereign has entered the Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s corpse.]

(Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan has entered…]

as

[Your good friend Divine Robe Daoist was cursed by a mysterious curse.]

[Your enemy Seven Dao Sage has successfully revived.)

(Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage has fused his Great Dao with the Sword Dao and successfully stepped into the Great Dao Supreme Realm.)

Foolish Sword Sage had become a Great Dao Supreme!

Was this considered rebuilding after destruction?

Han Jue couldn’t help but sigh. This fellow was indeed powerful.

Han Tuo and Yi Tian were also considered people with great providence. They had reached the Freedom Realm so quickly and were even stronger than his disciples.

No wonder most cultivators risked their lives to seek opportunities.

Han Jue also noticed that Seven Dao Sage had revived.

Seven Dao Sage was no longer anything in his eyes. If he knew his place, Han Jue wouldn’t care about him for the time being.

But he would be insta-killed if he still dared to act recklessly.

The reason why Han Jue didn’t kill the Seven Dao Sage was that he wanted to wait for him to come knocking before throwing him into the Primordial Heavenly Prison to strengthen his forces.

Unlike Sages, Great Dao Sages were really difficult to nurture.

Han Jue continued reading the emails.

Pangu’s appearance caused his friends to settle down. They rarely encountered a series of beatings.

It had to be said that Pangu was ferocious. His influence could be said to be the number one in history.

After reading the emails, Han Jue switched his consciousness to his clone. At this moment, his clone was still following the Fiendcelestials through the Chaos.

The Chaos was endless. It would take time to find Pangu. Furthermore, this fellow seemed to be deliberately hiding. It might be related to the battle that had just ended.

(Foolish Sword Sage sent you a dream. Do you accept?]

Han Jue’s thoughts were interrupted by the notification.

He hesitated for a moment and then asked in his mind, “Will it be dangerous for me to accept the Foolish Sword Sage’s dream?”

After all, this fellow was already the Great Dao Supreme. He was no longer the same as before.

[400 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[No]

Han Jue chose to accept the dream.

The dream was a Primordial Void, the place where the two of them fought.

The Foolish Sword Sage looked no different from before, but his entire body had already transformed. Countless sword shadows were interwoven in his eyes.

The Foolish Sword Sage smiled. “I’ve become stronger. You might not be my match anymore.”

Han Jue said, “Then, you’re really powerful.”

The Foolish Sword Sage said, “Don’t fight with Pangu. He has a mighty figure behind him. It’s impossible to defeat him. Pangu’s revival this time is only to restore the Chaotic Order. Perhaps it’s for the Primordial Fiendcelestial. After all, in the chaotic situation, it’s easier for the Primordial Fiendcelestial to grow.”

Han Jue said helplessly, “I don’t want to fight with him either, but can I make the decision?”

“Perhaps, as long as it’s the Heavenly Dao’s rules.”

“You survived? Pangu won’t find trouble with you anymore?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Yes, I’ve already fought him twice. It can be considered as proving myself. He promised not to look for me again as long as I don’t stop him.”

Han Jue fell into deep thought.

Pangu was actually a pawn.

The Foolish Sword Sage said, “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, I look forward to defeating you openly. Don’t die.”

With that, the dream shattered.

Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “I want to know who the greatest backer behind Pangu’s operation is?”

(1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

(Chaos Consciousness: Cultivation unknown, Chaotic Deity, Above the Great Dao, Rules and Order, Unspeakable Name.)

Indeed, it’s him!

Han Jue’s heart sank.

The strongest existence he knew!

There were not many providence labels, but each was extremely important.

Han Jue asked in his mind, “Will the Chaotic Consciousness attack me if I defeat Pangu?”

(1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[Not for the time being, but it will pay attention to you.]

Attention?

Han Jue suddenly thought of something and his expression became strange.

I see!

The Chaotic Consciousness guessed that there might be a Primordial Fiendcelestial among the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, so it was using Pangu to test the waters?

This fellow’s goal was not to clean up the Chaos but to find the Primordial Fiendcelestial.

Who else could defeat the strongest Chaotic Fiendcelestial apart from the Primordial Fiendcelestial?

Han Jue was in a dilemma.

Didn’t this mean that he couldn’t attack Pangu? Even with the protection of the Dao Field, it would be troublesome once his identity was exposed. The entire Chaos would target his Dao Field and his disciples, friends, and descendants.

Perhaps Han Jue could move all of them into the Dao Field, but wouldn’t that be imprisoning them?

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune.

I can only rely on you now.

Han Jue touched the Book of Misfortune and sighed.

I didn’t expect that I would still have to rely on you today.

You’re really my treasure!
