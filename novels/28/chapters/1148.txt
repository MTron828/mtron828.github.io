Chapter 1149 Too Late

The door to the Transcendent Divine Hall opened and mighty figures flew out. Nearly half of the mighty figures quickly used their Mystical Powers and fled out of the sea of clouds. The remaining mighty figures began to interact.

Han Tuo, Han Huang, Han Ling, Han Qing’er, Han Ye, Han Yao, Han Bashen, Yi Tian, and the others gathered and left together.

Yi Tian smiled. “Why don’t the Creator Lord directly reward you with this Great Dao Providence Divine Authority?”

Han Tuo shook his head. “Father is already the Lord. All living beings are his children. What’s the point of bias?”

The others nodded.

They had their own living beings ever since they established their Great Dao World. Their mentality was also changing, so they could understand Han Jue’s thoughts.

If he really favored them by blood and had many children, who should he favor?

They began to discuss where Han Jue would throw the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority.

Long Hao suddenly mentioned, “Could it be in the Heavenly Dao?”

The others’ eyes lit up.

It was impossible for this Great Dao

Providence Divine Authority to be in the

Ultimate Origin World. Other than the

Ultimate Origin World, only the Heavenly Dao

had a high possibility!

They immediately took action.

In the third Dao Field.

Han Jue and Xing Hongxuan were chatting in

the Daoist temple.

“Tang Wan? That girl hasn’t mentioned

Xiaoqi for a long time.”

Xing Hongxuan shook her head in pity.

Han Jue smiled. “Perhaps she’s hiding it in her heart. You can let her go.”

Xing Hongxuan spread her hands and said, “My clone has long given her freedom, but she doesn’t want to leave. She still wants to cultivate with my clone.”

Tang Wan was not a Hidden Sect disciple, so she naturally could not enter the Dao Field. Therefore, Xing Hongxuan asked her clone to teach Tang Wan. This lasted for ten million years.

“Then let her go to the Dao Mystic Realm.”

“Alright, I quite like this girl. I’ll send my clone to help her if she encounters danger. Is that okay?”

“Up to you. When have I ever restricted you?”

“I thought you would set some rules.”

“There’s no need.”

Han Jue smiled. He indeed didn’t ask for

anything from the Endless Era. The one who set the rules was the Formless Transcendent Deity. He was happy to do this.

The Great Deity who had once claimed to transcend everything and not be affected by karma was now a rule maker and controlled all living beings. The difference was really

great.

The two of them talked about Han Huang next. Xing Hongxuan sighed. “This kid seems to have changed recently. He traveled the heavens and accumulated a lot of merit. He seems to be clearing his reputation.”

Han Jue smiled. “People will always change. Some will become bad, and naturally, some will also become good. In fact, everyone will

change between good and bad. It’s just defined by their level and standpoint. Huang’er only let go of his arrogance. In the

past, he treated all living beings as ants. Now,

he truly realizes that the difference in bloodline only affects cultivation. To the essence of living beings, there’s no difference.”

Xing Hongxuan fell into deep thought.

She had also indulged ever since she obtained Han Jue’s invincible power. However, because it was not her own power, she was not too fearless. However, she admitted that she was indeed very arrogant in that period of time.

She couldn’t help but look at Han Jue. Even if her husband was invincible, he didn’t wreak havoc on all living beings. Instead, he maintained his original intention and stayed away from the mortal world.

Thinking of this, Xing Hongxuan was filled with admiration for him.

As expected of the man she liked. “Husband, do you have any thoughts of

finding a new lover? Do you want me to help you?” Xing Hongxuan giggled.

Han Jue shook his head and laughed. “Aren’t you afraid of losing favor?”

“I’m not afraid. Besides, it’s useless even if

I’m afraid. I might as well continue to please you.”

Xing Hongxuan shrugged indifferently. The smartest thing about her was that she

never interfered with Han Jue’s decisions. She also maintained a good relationship with his other women. She was the gel that bound them together.

She knew very well that the difference between her and Han Jue was huge. It was impossible for her to restrain him. Could it be that she was like a mortal woman

and insisted that Han Jue only had her?

What if he was unwilling?

Could she go look for other men?

In that case, she would have long floated in

the cycle of reincarnation for countless generations. Han Jue smiled. “There’s no need. Do you

think the desires of the mortal world can still control me?”

This was the truth. Unless he was touched, it

was very difficult for Han Jue to like women

because of his instincts. The love between men and women was no longer that important in his eyes. It was not as good as the joy brought by cultivation.

As for being touched, with Han Jue’s strength,

it was almost impossible for other women to touch him.

The two of them chatted for a while more before Han Jue stood up and left. After interacting with the other women for a period

of time, he returned to his Daoist temple. He did not enter cultivation immediately. Instead, he observed the blank domain and looked at Han Liang.

After Han Liang left the third Dao Field, he first went to join Long Hao’s Dragon Court. Long Hao was pleasantly surprised by his arrival. For the next period of time, Han Liang

would probably have to stay in the Dragon Court. It was also a good thing to have someone guide him.

To Long Hao, Han Liang’s potential was extremely outstanding. Putting aside their relationship as fellow disciples, he had to rope

him in.

Han Jue closed his eyes after watching for a while.

Cultivation began!

…

Another ten million years passed.

Han Jue opened his eyes. His cultivation level

had increased a little, but overall, he had improved very little. Who knew how long it would take for him to break through? However, the improvement of the Creator

Lord was also something that all living beings needed to spend countless years to accumulate.

Han Jue was really not used to not seeing Han

Liang when he opened his eyes.

Han Jue felt that time had passed a little

slowly ever since he interacted with his two grandsons. These tens of millions of years surpassed the hundreds of millions of years of memories.

A disciple was waiting outside the Daoist temple. Murong Qi.

Han Jue let him in.

After entering the temple, Murong Qi first

bowed and then went straight to the point. “Grandmaster, Fang Liang is missing. Do you know where he is?”

the

Murong Qi and Fang Liang were disciples of the same generation and had always been best brothers. At least, Murong Qi thought so. Han Jue said, “He went to the Origin Space-time to find a disciple who severed karma.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Origin Space-time? Murong Qi was stunned.

“Ignore him. With your strength, you’ll be doomed if you go. Furthermore, he’s not in danger for the time being,” Han Jue said

softly. Murong Qi nodded. “Other than that, there’s one more thing. We Chaotic Fiendcelestials have recently broken up, and each of us has established a force. I’m afraid this matter…”

Han Jue said, “Let nature take its course. In the past, I nurtured you because I needed you

to fight for me. Unfortunately, this opportunity didn’t arrive. Now, I don’t need you anymore. You can work hard for yourselves.” Murong Qi felt ashamed.

They seemed to have never helped Han Jue

since the beginning. Instead, Han Jue had saved them time and time again.

If not for him, they wouldn’t be where they

were today.

Murong Qi began to kowtow in shame.

Han Jue smiled. “Murong Qi, I’ve always thought highly of you. Since they’re fighting, you have to fight too. So what if you’re a fellow disciple? I won’t interfere as long as you fight openly. I hope that you can become

a Dao Creator one day.” Murong Qi looked up. He was so excited that his arms trembled. He felt like his entire body

was on fire.
