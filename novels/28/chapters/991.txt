Chapter 993 Number One Deity’s Confusion

Facing Han Jue’s words, all the geniuses were extremely nervous.

The Divine Might Heavenly Sage wanted to go all out?

How could this be?

Han Jue didn’t care what they thought. He stared at all the geniuses and said, “I’ll start counting down. I’ll attack in three breaths!”

!!

“Three!”

The geniuses were so frightened that they immediately took out their Dharma treasures and used their defensive or evasive Mystical Powers.

The scene was spectacular. All sorts of lights appeared and illuminated the void, making the living beings in Ten Absolute City extremely nervous.

“Two!”

Jiang Jueshi used the Great Reincarnation Creation Technique. Huang Zuntian and Azure Heaven Mystic activated the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. Han Huang’s body emitted divine light and Han Tuo condensed his Fiendcelestial Dharma idol.

It could be said that they each were displaying their own Mystical Powers.

“One!”

Han Jue suddenly raised his right palm as soon as he finished speaking.

Almost instantly, the thousands of geniuses subconsciously wanted to use their movement Mystical Powers to dodge, but they were too slow.

Divine Might Great Heaven Palm!

Han Jue struck out with his palm and an invisible Ultimate Origin Power erupted!

More than twenty thousand geniuses were instantly annihilated. Their bodies and souls were destroyed, leaving only a trace of their remnant souls. They didn’t even have time to escape. Even the Great Dao Supreme Han Huang and the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority Huang Zuntian were all destroyed without a doubt!

Domineering!

Powerful!

The void fell silent!

It was the same in Ten Absolute City.

It was different from what they had expected. They thought that there would be a spectacular Mystical Power scene, but the Ultimate Origin Power was invisible and colorless. In their vision, Han Jue waved his palm, and all the geniuses were reduced to ashes.

This scene shocked them even more.

More than twenty thousand remnant souls began to recover. The dozens of geniuses recovered almost instantly. They looked at Han Jue in shock.

The fastest was not Han Huang.

It was Formless World.

Han Jue secretly paid attention to him. It was indeed impressive. Be it his image or cultivation, he had a chance to reach the Eternal Peak!

As the strongest in the Chaos, Han Jue’s thoughts were extremely powerful. When the geniuses revived, he had already begun to calculate crazily.

Two breaths later, Han Jue directly sent all the remaining geniuses who had yet to recover their bodies back to Ten Absolute City. Only ten thousand were left in the void.

Many from the Hidden Sect and the Heavenly Dao were also eliminated.

The top ten thousand were at least late-stage Freedom Sages!

“You are the Ten Thousand Strong in the first Chaotic Assembly,” Han Jue slowly said, and the ten thousand geniuses secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

It had only been two breaths of time. If they had let their guard down just now, they would probably have been eliminated.

They were more shocked.

The Divine Might Heavenly Sage actually used one move…

Han Huang’s expression was very ugly. He knew that his father was very strong, but after so many years, he thought that he could at least withstand a move from him. He did not expect…

Some of the peerless geniuses who were confident in fighting for the Eternal Peak also had ugly expressions.

Han Jue deliberately waited until the Great Dao Divine Spirits dispersed the defeated geniuses before sending the top ten thousand back.

He did not say much. It was useless no matter what he said. He didn’t need to rope in these people.

Han Jue returned to the hall. All the mighty figures looked at him with reverence, but no one flattered him because they had already seen it previously.

Every time they thought of how Han Jue would be the youngest prodigy even if he joined the Chaotic Assembly, the mighty figures had extremely complicated emotions. If their disciples and children were also so powerful..

Forget it.

They wouldn’t be able to control them if they were that powerful.

The Ultimate God of Punishment smiled. “You’ve worked hard.”

Han Jue said, “I won’t do it in the next Chaotic Assembly.”

“Haha, of course. It’s the first Assembly, so it has to be special.” The Ultimate God of Punishment smiled.

Then, his voice resounded throughout Ten Absolute City.

“Third round, the competition for the Thousand Lord positions will begin in half a

year.”

They had to rest for another half a year, but this time, the geniuses really had to rest and restore their Dao hearts.

The round just now was too short, but the shock it gave them was unforgettable.

They would probably never forget this scene.

News of Ten Absolute City also spread throughout the Chaos.

All the living beings in the Chaos were excited. They wished they could personally join in the fun.

Below the bottom of the Chaos.

In the Consciousnessless Great Dao World.

The Number One Deity, who had completely shed his white fur, sat on a huge rock and looked up at the sky.

His face became handsome and strong. He wore a beast skin robe that barely covered his body. He muttered, “How lively. Chaos, for how long can you be so prosperous?”

A sword Qi descended from the sky and landed in front of the Number One Deity. It condensed into a sword shadow, and half of Laozi’s face was reflected in the blade.

The Number One Deity looked at him and asked, “Are you ready?”

Laozi asked, “I have to know who else is there other than you and me. Tell me everything.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Divine Might Heavenly Sage, Dao Ancestor, an unspeakable existence, Devil Ancestor, and Northern Chaos Holy Lord. If we join forces, we can summon 90% of the living beings in the Chaos,” the Number One Deity replied.

Laozi narrowed his eyes and asked, “May I ask who’s behind you? You’re sealed here. You can’t go to the Chaos, right?”

The Number One Deity said, “Actually, you’ve already guessed it. Why ask? It’s fine as long as we have common benefits. There’s no need to ask about some things. Leave a way out.”

Laozi was silent.

The Number One Deity said, “There will be more in the future. As for when something will happen, we still have to wait for the opportunity.

“Fellow Daoist Li, you can continue to understand the mighty figures who established the Great Dao World. If they have any ambitions, they will naturally join us.”

Laozi replied, “I know.”

With that, the sword shadow dissipated.

The Number One Deity looked up at the bottom of the Chaos again.

“Divine Might Heavenly Sage is really strong. No wonder you said that he has the highest chance of reaching that realm…

“However, if you can realize this, why can’t the Lord of Chaos… Since you realize it, why don’t you…”

The Number One Deity’s eyes flashed with confusion.

The third stage of the Chaotic Assembly began as scheduled. This was also the last stage.

It would decide the Thousand Lords, Hundred Sovereigns, Ten Absolutes, and Eternal Peak.

It would be decided in one-on-one random battles. The loser would be eliminated!

The Ultimate God of Punishment was very good at making arrangements. First, he let the Freedom Sages compete. When the number of Freedom Sages who won reached the number of Great Dao Sages, he would make them fight, including the Great Dao Supreme!

The Great Dao Supreme was thought to be a Great Dao Sage in the Chaos. Most living beings didn’t know this realm at all.

This round would naturally take a long time.

The battle environment was divided into more than a hundred deep spaces built by the Ultimate God of Punishment. Once they entered the battle space, there were no rules on how to emerge victorious.

The hundred or so battle spaces were also reflected above Ten Absolute City. The living beings in the city were cultivators, so they could see them clearly no matter how far away they were.

Han Jue was also watching seriously. His attention was mainly focused on the people around him.

The Black Hell Chicken would fight in the first hundred battles. This chicken won very easily.

The Black Hell Chicken was already a Chaotic Fiendcelestial and was not far from becoming a Great Dao Sage.

If not for the fact that it did not like to cultivate as much as the other Fiendcelestials, it might have already stepped into the Great Dao Realm.

Although it won, this fellow’s foul mouth embarrassed Han Jue.
