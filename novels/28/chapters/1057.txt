Chapter 1059 Late-Stage, Reappearance of a Transcendent Existence

Three million years later.

Han Jue began to break through. His cultivation had already been suppressed to the extreme and was about to erupt like a volcano.

He finally broke through after a million years. Late-stage Dao Creator!

His Ultimate Origin Power began to increase. Even the Ultimate Origin World began to

rapidly expand and devour the nearby blank domain.

Han Jue was immersed in this extreme feeling of becoming stronger and couldn’t extricate himself.

He checked his attributes panel as he consolidated his cultivation.

[Name: Han Jue]

[Lifespan: 134,001,982 /

[Constitution: Extreme Dao Ultimate Origin Body]

…

Awesome!

This series of origin lifespans fascinated Han Jue.

Most importantly, after reaching the late stage, one could look forward to the perfected Dao Creator Realm. Above that was the Creator Lord Realm that no one had reached since ancient times.

Just thinking of the Creator Lord Realm made Han Jue’s blood boil.

He was already very close to invincibility!

Han Jue’s cultivation finally stabilized after spending nearly 800,000 years.

The first thing he did when he opened his eyes was to take out the Book of Misfortune. Shan’e was still outside the Daoist temple. He could curse the Ninth Chaos without being discovered.

He immediately started.

Five days later, his lifespan decreased. A second was equivalent to ten thousand

lifetimes.

This time, Han Jue only spent 200 quadrillion

years of his lifespan to damage the Ninth Chaos’ Dao heart and reduce his cultivation.

As for how much he had fallen, he did not know. However, the Chaos showed signs of collapsing again. He did not dare to continue.

It was fine to delay the Ninth Chaos’ progress. Han Jue didn’t mind letting the Ninth Chaos or others step into the Lord Realm after he surpassed the Creator Lord Realm.

It was safer to have the strongest position in

his hands. Han Jue didn’t trust others. He could give peace to all living beings, but as a living being, he didn’t believe that invincible people could protect him forever.

After cursing, Han Jue put away the Book of

Misfortune and let Shan’e in.

Shan’e couldn’t wait anymore. He quickly entered the temple and knelt down.

“Progenitor, you’ve succeeded?” Shan’e asked

carefully. To expel him for so long, it had to be

an impressive Mystical Power.

Han Jue smiled and nodded. “I’m in a good

mood. How about I preach the Dao for you and

teach you a Mystical Power?”

“Sure!” Shan’e agreed in surprise.

Han Jue began to preach the Dao. During the

lecture, he was also sorting out his Dao

techniques.

Gradually, his Great Dao voice covered the

entire third Dao Field, immersing all the

disciples.

The living beings in the third Dao Field were all enlightened by Han Jue. Their potential was not considered impressive, but with the help of the Spirit Qi in the Dao Field and Han Jue’s occasional lecture, their cultivation levels were all very strong. They were all already Freedom Sages, but because they didn’t go out, they

didn’t make a name for themselves in the universe of stars.

Ten thousand years passed in the blink of an

eye.

Han Jue began the simulation trial upon seeing

that Shan’e was still immersed in Dao

comprehension.

He challenged 200,000 Immeasurable Destruction Venerables!

Very easy!

As expected of a late-stage Dao Creator. The

difference in every minor realm was worlds

apart!

Han Jue continued to increase the number of enemies.

Three hundred thousand!

An increase of one hundred thousand in one

go!

They were easily killed!

It was very difficult to insta-kill those in this

realm, but Han Jue didn’t feel any pressure.

Four hundred thousand!

It was still relaxed!

Five hundred thousand!

Han Jue began to find it difficult. The pressure

of five hundred thousand Immeasurable Destruction Venerables combined was too

strong.

He stopped here. Perhaps this was not his

limit, but as long as it was difficult, he had to be cautious. Only then would he not develop a lazy and disdainful mentality.

Han Jue was very satisfied with his improvement. He stood up and started to stretch his muscles while checking his emails.

[Your daughter Han Ling was cursed by a mysterious curse.]

[Your good friend Huang Zuntian has grasped Supreme Misfortune.]

[Your son Han Huang was attacked by your

good friend Huang Zuntian in his dreams. His soul was damaged.]

[Your good friend Zhao Shuangquan was attacked by your good friend Huang Zuntian in Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

his dreams and was severely injured.] [Your disciple Ji Xianshen fell into a crack in

the blank domain and into an unknown domain.]

[Your good friend Huang Zuntian has absorbed

the Ancient Primordial World’s providence and his cultivation has increased greatly.]

[Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by the evil devils of Shi Tian] x80092283

[Your disciple…]

[Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has received guidance from a transcendent existence. His cultivation has increased.]

[Your descendant Han Ye obtained a dream from a transcendent existence and learned a Great Dao Mystical Power.]

How lively!

Huang Zuntian was too active. To be precise,

Primordial Origin was too active. It was unknown if Primordial Origin had snatched Huang Zuntian’s memories. Currently, Huang

Zuntian’s favorability towards Han Jue didn’t decrease.

In addition, transcendent existences appeared again. It seemed that the Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity had been released.

Tsk tsk, the Dao Creator was playing chess. It was going to be good in the future.

As Dao Creators, they were constantly suppressed. If it were Han Jue, he would definitely be furious.

However, the Ninth Chaos was too strong. They

were angry but did not dare to say anything. If

they knew that the Ninth Chaos was injured or that the Dark Forbidden Lord could threaten it, they would definitely have a plan, especially

the Chaotic Consciousness. It was extremely rebellious.

Han Jue continued reading. The emails were abundant, but fortunately, nothing happened to the people he cared about.

Now, he was waiting for Huang Zuntian to

appear.

He would attack him as long as Huang Zuntian appeared in the Chaos.

Huang Zuntian had been loyal for so many

years. How could Han Jue let him be harmed? However, he still couldn’t deduce Huang Zuntian’s whereabouts. He was either hiding with a Supreme Treasure or was still in the Ancient Primordial World.

Huang Zuntian would definitely find Han

Huang. Once the battle started, Han Huang would borrow the Ultimate Origin Power and he could find Huang Zuntian then.

Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.

…

In a dark palace in the Creation Emperor Court.

Han Huang was meditating and cultivating. His expression changed and his neck twitched slightly. Something was wrong. After a while, he suddenly opened his eyes and

exhaled. His eyes were filled with killing intent. “You want to snatch the name of the Primordial Fiendcelestial from me? Are you worthy?” Han Huang muttered to himself with

a murderous expression.

He stood up and appeared in front of Han Ling.

“Fourth Sister, I’m leaving for a period of time,” Han Huang said. Han Ling frowned. “Why?”

Han Huang did not hide anything and told her

about

Life Lord provoking him. Han Ling said, “Second Brother must be

careful. The other party is clearly provoking

you,

which means that he’s confident.”

Han Huang waved his hand. “I know, so I have

to leave to prevent that fellow from attacking

and affecting the Creation Emperor Court.”

Han Ling felt that it made sense. “Do you need me to accompany you?” “Hahaha. Fourth Sister, you’re indeed very strong, but I’m not weak either. After all, I’m recognized by all living beings as the strongest in the Chaos. How can I be afraid of a

one-on-one battle?”

Han Huang laughed and left, not giving Han

Ling a chance to say anything. Han Ling frowned as she looked in the direction he left.
