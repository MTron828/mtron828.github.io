Chapter 291 Ascension, Talent of an Immortal Emperor

Heavenly Dao Buddha? Han Jue frowned. What was this? Why did he suddenly hate him?

Han Jue immediately checked his interpersonal relationships and quickly found the Heavenly Dao Buddha.

[Heavenly Dao Buddha: Cultivation unknown. Connate lifeform of the Heavenly Dao, Immeasurable Emperor, transformed from a corpse in the Devil Ancestor. He has obtained the providence of the Heavenly Dao. Because Liu Bei forcefully occupied the body of the Victorious Fighting Buddha, he has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]

Han Jue frowned even more. He had actually been discovered by the Heavenly Dao Buddha.

What should he do?

Should he add him to the curse list?

Han Jue thought for a moment and decided to curse in ten years to avoid being suspected.

There were Buddhist factions in the netherworld, so he had to be careful.

Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating

After fifty-seven years, Liu Bei finally succeeded in possessing the body of the Victorious Fighting Buddha. However, he was unable to unleash the body’s full strength. Han Jue asked him to return to the Sword Dao River and guard it while adapting to the Victorious Fighting Buddha’s physical strength.

Han Jue wasn’t worried that the Heavenly Dao Buddha would attack the Sword Dao River. Now that the Immortal World was in chaos, how could the Buddhists have the time to care about this?

Even if he really came, Liu Bei could still escape. Even if he couldn’t escape, Han Jue would fight to avenge him in the future.

Cough cough!

That sounded heartless.

After Liu Bei left, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the Heavenly Dao Buddha.

Curse Dharma treasures weren’t rare in the myriad worlds. The most powerful characteristic of the Book of Misfortune was that it could not be deduced as the real culprit.

As long as the Heavenly Dao Buddha was cursed, he wouldn’t have the time to retrieve the Victorious Fighting Buddha’s body.

Han Jue couldn’t help but sigh. The Book of Misfortune was really a good treasure.

He hadn’t wasted all those Heavenly Dao Spirit Stones. If he had spent them on other Dharma treasures, how could he have been so carefree today?

Han Jue admired his thinking.

This was what it meant to kill enemies a thousand miles away, to be on guard! Han Jue cursed as he checked his emails regularly. [Your good friend Huang Zuntian has obtained the true teachings of the Jie School. His cultivation has increased greatly.)

[Your good friend Huang Jihao was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong and was severely injured.)

(Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by your enemy Li Xuan’ao.]

(Your grand-disciple Fang Liang accidentally entered the Dark Forbidden Zone.)

(Your good friend Di Hongye was expelled by time.]

(Your Dao Companion Xuan Qingjun was attacked by demons] x14021

(Your good friend Zhou Fan was attacked by demons] x89743

Han Jue raised his eyebrows. Huang Zuntian had obtained the true teachings of the Jie School. Was he promoted?

Wow!

Were Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao in conflict with each other?

What was this brat Fang Liang doing again?

My Dao Companion isn’t cultivating properly and has also begun to involve herself? Han Jue thought silently.

He sensed danger.

The Heavenly Dao had begun to make a move on him. His disciples, grand-disciples, Dao Companions, and good friends had entered the calamity to lure him into it?

Impossible!

Han Jue was secretly vigilant.

He had to hurry up and become stronger so that he could protect the people around him in the future!

Han Jue’s eyes became firm.

Immortal World, an Immortal Island.

Dozens of Jie School disciples stood on the mountain peak and looked at the end of the sea.

A white crane flew over, and a figure stood on its back. It was Huang Zuntian.

Seeing the white crane flying over, the disciples knelt down.

“Greetings, Supremacy!”

Dozens of disciples shouted in unison. Their voices were loud and resounded throughout the Immortal Island.

The White Crane landed by the cliff, and Huang Zuntian followed.

“From today onwards, Huang Zuntian is the Island Master of Golden Crab Island. All disciples have to listen to him. If anyone disobeys, they will be expelled from the Jie School,” the White Crane slowly said with an unquestionable tone.

Whoosh,

The disciples were in an uproar. They all knew Huang Zuntian. He had joined the sect later than them and was considered their junior. Now, he had actually surpassed them and become the Island Master?

Impossible!

Wasn’t this nonsense?

“Supremacy, he’s only a Grand Unity Heaven Immortal!” A disciple couldn’t help but say.

The White Crane snorted. “I’ll teach him personally. This is the Vice Sect Master’s intention. I hope that the Jie School Immortal Island can follow the philosophy of the Sect Master and avoid the calamity. There’s no room for discussion regarding this matter. Whoever dares to disrespect Huang Zuntian in the future will die.”

The moment the word “die” was spoken, the temperature suddenly plummeted. All the disciples felt a chill down their spines and did not dare to refute.

Huang Zuntian’s eyes flickered and he heaved a sigh of relief. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He could cultivate in peace now.

He had to cultivate diligently and not let that senior down.

Thinking of Han Jue, Huang Zuntian was full of fighting spirit.

Four years later.

Xing Hongxuan visited Han Jue, and Dao Comprehension Sword was chased out of the cave abode. She felt wronged.

“Have you really thought about it?” Han Jue frowned.

Xing Hongxuan nodded. She took a deep breath and tried her best to remain calm. “If I reincarnate, will you abandon me?”

She decided to reincarnate and try for a good potential!

She struggled for a hundred years and finally made up her mind. It was only because the disciples of the Hidden Sect cultivated too quickly. Looking at her again, if not for the fact that she had encountered many opportunities, she was afraid…

Han Jue said, “I’ve already left a mark on you. No matter how many lifetimes you reincarnate, I can still find you.”

Xing Hongxuan asked, “After reincarnation, will I still be myself?” “I can let you reincarnate with your memories.”

“That’s good!”

Han Jue sighed as he looked at her.

Looking back at the beginning of their acquaintance, everything was like a dream. He had met Xing Hongxuan when he had just stepped into the cultivation path. He hadn’t expected that after more than three thousand years, the two of them would become physically intimate Dao Companions.

Xing Hongxuan suddenly leaned forward and smiled sweetly. “Let me have some fun before I reincarnate.”

“What do you want to do?”

“Don’t move. Don’t resist me. Yes, lie down.”

“Slow down…”

“Yes…”

Several months later, Han Jue brought Xing Hongxuan’s soul to the Bridge of Forgetfulness.

He directly extracted her soul and let her die without any pain. There was still a long line of ghosts in front of the Bridge of Forgetfulness. All of them were numb and absent-minded, not the least bit angry.

Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Meng Po, and the two of them met in the distance.

Han Jue stated his intention.

Meng Po frowned. “This is against the reincarnation rules.”

Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

Eh?

You’re telling me the rules now? “Isn’t Tu Ling’er also…” Han Jue said bluntly.

Meng Po hurriedly interrupted him. “This is not a problem!”

Han Jue nodded in satisfaction. “Don’t feed her your soup. Give her a good birth. She and Tu Ling’er are both from the Hidden Sect. The better her potential is, the stronger the protection Tu Ling’er will receive in the future.”

Meng Po was speechless.

She could only agree helplessly.

“I’ll send her to reincarnate first. Wait for me.” Meng Po sighed.

Han Jue immediately released Xing Hongxuan’s soul and let Meng Po lead her to the Bridge of Forgetfulness. Xing Hongxuan turned around and looked at him reluctantly.

Although she trusted Han Jue very much, she had no experience in reincarnation and was still very panicked.

Han Jue watched her leave.

“This is the benefit of cultivation. The cycle of life and death is no longer so hopeless.” Han Jue understood, and his eyes became more determined.

About an hour passed.

Meng Po returned.

She was the first to speak. “I let her be reincarnated into a Sacred Dynasty of the Immortal World. Her potential is top-notch, and she might have a chance to become an Immortal Emperor.”

Surprised, Han Jue asked, “With such a powerful potential, won’t the Sacred Dynasty realize that she’s a reincarnated person?”
