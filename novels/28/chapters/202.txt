Chapter 204 Powerful Shen Peng, Li Yao’s Predicament

[Li Yao: Fifth level of the Mahayana Realm, Son of Heaven and Earth, descendant of an Immortal Emperor. Born with an accompanying Heavenly Phoenix. Brings blessing to the mortal world she is in. Cultivated for 700 years and has reached the Mahayana Realm. She is cautious by nature and hates fighting. She likes to cultivate.]

Han Jue looked at the message in front of him with a strange expression.

This description…

It was like a female version of him!

Han Jue immediately had a good impression of Li Yao.

They were like-minded!

Han Jue found Li Yao more and more pleasing to the eye. Li Yao, who was quietly cultivating, was like a fairy. The scene was so harmonious.

After watching for a while, Han Jue retracted his divine sense.

He didn’t disturb her.

Who knew which mortal realm Li Yao was in?

“Master, what’s going on? Is there a world hidden in the water?” Dao Comprehension Sword asked.

Han Jue didn’t hide anything and explained Heavenly Water’s ability. Dao Comprehension Sword was shocked.

This water could actually spy on other worlds. It was truly impressive.

Han Jue meditated again and continued cultivating

…

In a peach forest, a woman in a green dress stood under a tree, waiting shyly and expectantly. She had a beautiful face and looked around from time to time.

In the distance, two people stood behind a tree.

They were Murong Qi and Xun Chang’an. Murong Qi urged, “Master, what are you waiting for? I’m waiting for you!” Xun Chang’an wore a bamboo hat and a veil covered his face. He was extremely nervous. “Don’t worry. You’ve protected her for ten years. She already treats you as her sweetheart. Go.” Murong Qi pushed him out.

Xun Chang’an was almost pushed down by him.

This brat didn’t know his limits!

Xun Chang’an cursed silently before mustering his courage to walk towards the woman in the green dress.

In next to no time, the woman in a green dress saw Xun Chang’an walk over.

Xun Chang’an wore a bamboo hat and black clothes. His aura was extraordinary, and it conformed to the woman’s expectations of mighty cultivators.

“He has been secretly protecting me…”

The woman in the green dress had a dazed expression as she looked at Xun Chang’an.

Seeing her expression, Xun Chang’an was excited.

Qian’er was finally going to be his!

Xun Chang’an quickened his pace.

When he arrived in front of the woman in the green dress, he fell silent again, not knowing what to say.

For a moment, the peach blossom forest was silent.

The woman in the green dress bit her lips and said, “Why have you always…”

Xun Chang’an suppressed his excitement and said, “I’ve been looking for you for hundreds of years. In my previous life, you grew up with me. You’re the love of my life.”

His confession made the woman’s neck and ears turn red.

Several hundred years!

The woman in the green dress was completely entranced.

How many women in the world could withstand such confessions and devotion?

The woman in the green dress asked nervously, “Can I see your face?”

Xun Chang’an hesitated.

The woman in the green dress raised her hand and gently removed his veil.

The next second, she shuddered and took a step back.

This step was like a basin of cold water that extinguished the flames in Xun Chang’an’s heart.

Xun Chang’an smiled bitterly and asked, “Am I very ugly?”

The woman in the green dress was silent.

She wanted to say that it was fine, but he was really too ugly. She had never seen such an ugly person. He wasn’t deformed or anything, but ugly in the truest sense.

“I…” The woman in the green dress hesitated.

Xun Chang’an was furious, but he had long thought of such a possibility, so he did not despair.

He had already experienced despair and was no longer afraid of it.

Xun Chang’an asked in pain, “Then I’ll leave?”

Since they couldn’t meet, he would continue to hide in the dark and protect her for life.

“Sigh… don’t go…” The woman in the green dress sighed. Her words improved Xun Chang’an’s mood again.

Could it be that Qian’er didn’t mind his ugliness in this life?

In the distance, Murong Qi burst into maniacal laughter. He tried his best to suppress his voice and kept pounding the tree trunk. He was about to die of laughter.

Thirty years had passed since Han Jue discovered Li Yao.

He had finally reached the mid-stage Reincarnation Mystic Immortal Realm. Although the speed of breaking through was slower than before, it was still acceptable to Han Jue.

In the past thirty years, whenever he cursed his enemies, he would also take a look at Li Yao.

This woman really knew how to cultivate diligently. She sat under the willow tree for thirty years without moving. It was worth mentioning that no one came to disturb her.

Logically speaking, being in a city would always cause one to be disturbed. It wasn’t a paradise.

Perhaps the mortal world Li Yao lived in was much more powerful than the Scarlet Cloud World. It was precisely because of this that people were used to cultivation. Thirty years was not a long time for them.

After breaking through, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune to celebrate.

As he cursed, he checked the strongest person around the Scarlet Cloud World.

[Marshal Shen Peng: Perfected Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm, second-grade Heavenly General of the Heavenly Court]

Han Jue was puzzled. Why was Marshal Shen Peng here?

He didn’t extend his divine sense to avoid disturbing the two gods. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Several months later, Han Jue checked again. Marshal Shen Peng was still there.

Thus, Han Jue began to use the simulation trial to challenge him.

An hour later, he opened his eyes with a strange expression.

He had actually lost!

They were both perfected Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm cultivators. Even Di Taibai could not defeat him, but Marshal Shen Peng could.

Moreover, Han Jue was suppressed the entire time.

Wow.

As expected of the Heavenly Court’s Marshal, his combat strength was quite impressive.

Han Jue guessed that Marshal Shen Peng should be on the same level as the Divine Palace’s Sword God Emperor.

After about three years, Marshal Shen Peng left.

Han Jue found it strange.

What was there to talk about between these two?

Couldn’t they chat in Heavenly Court?

Han Jue stood up and came to the Nine Heavens Galaxy Water. He continued to look at Li Yao.

Dao Comprehension Sword asked, “Master, do you like her?”

Every ten years, he would stare at Li Yao.

Han Jue replied, “A little.”

Dao Comprehension Sword was even more displeased.

After so many years, Li Yao’s cultivation level had already reached the eighth level of the Mahayana Realm. Not long later, she would probably be able to ascend.

Han Jue hesitated to contact her.

As a providence bearer, she would definitely go far in the future. Han Jue could invite her to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain and discuss the Dao of seclusion together.

Cough cough!

The Dao of diligent cultivation!

Han Jue cursed silently.

On this day, Li Yao was finally disturbed.

It was her father, Li Tianxin.

“Yao’er, you’re about to reach the Loose Immortal. You should also get married. What do you think of the young master of the Lu family? His master is a Grand Unity Heaven Immortal.” Li Tianxin chuckled and asked.

Li Yao frowned and said, “Father, I don’t want to get married. I only want to cultivate. Don’t always think of relying on others. Give me time, I’ll lead the Li family to unprecedented prosperity.”

Li Tianxin shook his head and laughed. “Yao’er, cultivation is not so simple. You need opportunities. If you cultivate diligently all day, you will find it difficult to take a single step after reaching the immortal realm.”

“That’s because Father doesn’t know my talent. Even if I’m in the Immortal World, I can still surpass others with my own potential.”

“Yao’er, this is a rare opportunity. You can’t miss the fact that the young master of the Lu family likes you.” “Father, I really can’t agree.” “This matter is settled. Start preparing. Why would I harm you? I’m doing this for your own good!”

With that, Li Tianxin left.

Li Yao sat under the tree and frowned.
