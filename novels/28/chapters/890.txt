Chapter 891 Jiang Jueshi’s Submission

Qingluan’er knew that it was not as simple as fighting upon seeing her daughter’s expression. She glared at him.

Han Jue felt a little awkward under her gaze and said, “I want Qing’er to participate in the Chaotic Assembly, so I’m being stricter.”

Chaotic Assembly?

Qingluan’er and Han Qing’er were both interested.

Han Jue didn’t hide anything. After all, Han Qing’er had already attained the Dao. There was no benefit in hiding anymore. Instead, it would attract unnecessary consequences.

He only mentioned the information regarding the Chaotic Assembly and introduced the Great Dao Divine Spirits. He did not mention the rest.

Han Qing’er had heard of the Chaotic Assembly in the Universal Hall. She didn’t expect it to be so exciting and grand.

She immediately became excited. “I want to participate! I want to participate!”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qingluan’er said worriedly, “The entire Chaos is huge. Qing’er is powerful, but can she compare to the Chaotic Prodigies? It’s too dangerous!”

Han Qing’er seemed humiliated upon hearing this. She said indignantly, “Mother, you underestimate me!

“Besides, the Chaotic Assembly is being jointly held by Father and the leader of the Divine Spirits. Who dares to kill me?”

Then, Qingluan’er looked at her father in surprise.

Han Jue said seriously, “Don’t think like that. You might really die. Justice will be lost if the Chaotic Assembly is corrupted by the higher-ups. You have to be prepared to die as long as you want to participate!” Han Qing’er was silent.

Qingluan’er hurriedly dissuaded her.

“No, I want to participate. I’m my father’s daughter. How can I be mediocre? My elder brother can wander around and make a name for himself. Why can’t I? Also, my second brother is not even born yet and has been nurtured for millions of years. What talent is this? Mother, my second brother will definitely shock the world when he’s born. Do you want me to be the weakest in our family?” Han Qing’er said seriously. Her stubborn and strong-minded appearance was quite similar to Han Jue’s.

Qingluan’er said, “Silly child, if aren’t you the weakest, who will be? You’re the youngest, after all.”

Han Qing’er immediately felt defeated.

Han Jue was amused. This mother and daughter always bickered like sisters.

Back then, Qingluan’er doted on Han Tuo in every way and had never said anything to attack him. Of course, their mother-son relationship was not as close as the mother-daughter relationship.

“Alright, prepare to listen to the Dao,” Han Jue waved his sleeve and said. This sentence also entered the ears of all the disciples in the third Dao Field.

Everyone excitedly gathered.

Han Jue started preaching on the spot. Once the Dao voice sounded, all living beings entered a state of Dao comprehension.

On the barren star.

Jiang Jueshi and Liu Bei sat on the cliff.

Jiang Jueshi opened his eyes and exhaled.

Liu Bei did not open his eyes. “What’s wrong?”

Jiang Jueshi said, “My cultivation has become stagnant. It’s very strange. I don’t know why.”

Liu Bei opened his eyes and stared at him. He pondered for a moment and said, “Your Great Reincarnation Creation Technique is endless and profound, but it didn’t create a Great Dao that belongs to you alone. Cultivation is based on the Great Dao after attaining the Dao. How can you cultivate without the Great Dao?”

Jiang Jueshi said helplessly, “How can the Great Dao be so easy to create?”

Liu Bei hesitated for a moment and asked, “Should I ask that senior?”

Jiang Jueshi narrowed his eyes.

That senior was the hidden mighty figure in this universe.

Because of his experience in the Human School, Jiang Jueshi was very resistant to joining others. However, he also knew that he had to have a backing if he wanted to cultivate in the Chaos.

How strong one’s backing determined the distance one could walk.

“You don’t have to worry. That senior doesn’t need you to risk your life. Besides, you’re not qualified. He’s even stronger than ordinary Great Dao Divine Spirits in the Chaos.” Liu Bei shook his head and smiled.

Jiang Jueshi was moved. “So powerful?”

A Great Dao Divine Spirit was almost equivalent to a Great Dao Sage!

Liu Bei nodded.

Jiang Jueshi struggled for a moment before finally agreeing.

Liu Bei immediately closed his eyes and sent a voice transmission to the third Dao Field.

Han Jue immediately replied, “Let him continue cultivating and wait for my seclusion to end.”

Liu Bei told him the truth. Jiang Jueshi nodded and heaved a sigh of relief.

The other party was mainly in seclusion, which meant that he did not care about him that much. Thus, he wouldn’t scheme against him.

Jiang Jueshi glanced at Liu Bei gratefully. The latter had given him a residence and a huge opportunity. Such a good brother was rare in

life.

Han Jue preached the Dao for five hundred years. All the disciples of the third Dao Field obtained the inheritance. All the disciples were still immersed in a state of Dao comprehension when he stopped preaching.

Han Jue left quietly and returned to the Daoist temple to continue cultivating.

As for Jiang Jueshi, he would wait for a while to prevent this kid from suspecting anything.

Another hundred thousand years passed just like that.

Jiang Jueshi was already anxious. He asked Liu Bei again, “How long will that senior be in seclusion?”

Liu Bei opened his eyes and said helplessly, “How would I know?”

Jiang Jueshi sighed.

He had been looking forward to it ever since he started thinking about this, but the other party did not appear.

He had thought that the other party was after his talent. But it was ridiculous now that he thought about it. In the eyes of mighty figures, he was probably inferior to Liu Bei.

Talent was only potential. Cultivation was the true capital.

Jiang Jueshi had a deeper understanding of the rules of survival in the Chaos.

“How can the path of cultivation be impatient? You endured hundreds of thousands of reincarnations. Why did your personality change after stopping?” a voice floated over, startling the two of them. A figure stood on the hill behind. His entire body shone with divine light, making it impossible to see his true appearance.

Liu Bei immediately knelt. Jiang Jueshi understood that the other party was the mighty figure Liu Bei had mentioned.

However…

How does he know about my past?

Jiang Jueshi panicked.

Han Jue chuckled and said, “I know what you’re thinking. It will be as easy as flipping your palm to see through a person’s past and future when you attain the Great Dao. Your experience might be unique in the Heavenly Dao, but it’s nothing in the Chaos.”

Jiang Jueshi took a deep breath and bowed. “I was rude earlier. Senior, please forgive me.”

“My Great Dao contains the principles of the three thousand Great Dao. Are you willing to cultivate it?” Han Jue asked. He had already used the Supreme Power to isolate the universe of stars. No one could spy on him.

Perhaps only a Dao Creator could.

It should not be surprising in the eyes of a Dao Creator.

Jiang Jueshi hesitated.

Han Jue said, “Many people have already cultivated this Dao. There’s no lack of Great Dao Sages. You don’t have to worry. You can also listen to the Dao before making a decision.”

Jiang Jueshi nodded and hurriedly thanked him.

Han Jue began to preach. This lecture lasted for ten thousand years.

Jiang Jueshi was different from the disciples of the third Dao Field. His talent had already increased to an extremely terrifying level. Ten thousand years of preaching was enough for him to comprehend a lot.

The lecture ended.

Jiang Jueshi slowly opened his eyes and looked at Han Jue with reverence.

What a profound Great Dao!

Jiang Jueshi was convinced. He had already embarked on the path of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin after comprehending the Dao for ten thousand years. He discovered that the Great Dao of Extreme Origin indeed contained the truths of the three thousand Great Dao. It was endlessly profound and ever-changing. It was very suitable for his Great Reincarnation Creation Technique.
