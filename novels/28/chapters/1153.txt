Chapter 1155 Dugu Wu, Prodigy Domain

“Then what do you think we should target, Master? Do you want us to fight for power?”

Chu Xiaoqi chuckled. He felt that his current life was quite good. He had nothing to cultivate and could go out with Chen Jue when he was bored.

Huang Zuntian snorted. “I’m confused. At your cultivation level, cultivation alone is not enough. You definitely have to create your own world. Whether the world can take form depends on whether the power you nurture is strong enough. With more living beings, there will naturally be more friction. Conflict is inevitable.”

Chu Xiaoqi was silent. He felt that it made sense, but he also felt that something was wrong.

Chen Jue asked, “Senior, other than creating a world, is there really no other way?”

Huang Zuntian glanced at him and said, “Perhaps, but not at the moment. Your

question is like asking if there are any other ways to become stronger other than cultivation.”

Chen Jue frowned.

Huang Zuntian said, “The Dao Mystic Realm is about to welcome a drastic change. It’s very difficult for you to stop it. Take care.”

With that, he vanished.

Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue looked at each other and saw the confusion in each other’s eyes.

Huang Zuntian came to talk about this?

Chen Jue sat down again and suddenly said, “Perhaps it’s time for us to part ways.

Chu Xiaoqi’s eyes widened. “If you want to create a force, we can join forces!”

“We’ve worked together for long enough. It’s time to split up. Xiaoqi, everyone has to have their own goals. The so-called carefreeness is too much.”

Chen Jue shook his head and looked into the distance. He became extremely determined. He seemed to have made a decision.

Chu Xiaoqi wanted to say something but hesitated. Looking at Chen Jue’s side profile, his words were stuck in his throat and he

could not say anything. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Indeed, if they did not separate now, when would they?

Even for couples, how many people could hold hands for tens of millions of years?

…

Time passed. The heavens couldn’t affect Han

Jue no matter how they fought.

He stayed in the Dao Field and cultivated

quietly. Time passed quickly.

In the past few years, the order of space-time had stabilized. Transmigrators were almost extinct. The Fusang Tree was also afraid of disappointing Han Jue. This also caused space-time to stabilize. The Fusang Tree’s cultivation level also increased. She was overjoyed and treated space-time more seriously.

In the blink of an eye, thirty million years

passed.

Han Jue walked out of the Daoist temple and stretched facing the sun.

Comfortable!

In the past few years, his cultivation level had increased faster than before. He sensed carefully and benefited from the development of the Ultimate Origin World.

Han Ling wanted to obtain the bloodline of

the evil devil in the Ultimate Origin World, but she failed time and time again. The evil devil was also constantly becoming stronger. Because he attracted the attention of the

various major factions, other geniuses of low birth began to appear. The Ultimate Origin World was no longer as calm as before. Instead, it was surging.

Chaos was not a good thing for the major factions of the Ultimate Origin World, but sometimes, it was beneficial to all living beings, especially living beings with low backgrounds. Chaos was also an opportunity for them. Of course, regardless of whether they were in chaos, it was survival of the

fittest.

Han Jue disappeared and came to the Ultimate Origin World.

This was the edge of the Ultimate Origin

World. Blood Qi filled the void. The broken meteors formed rings. In the center of the rings floated a huge stone tablet. The stone tablet was carved with blood words. The blood Qi in this area was emitted from these blood

words.

A figure sat on the stone tablet. It was a white-haired man. He was slightly thin and handsome, but because he was only skin and

bones, he looked very weak.

“How long can you last by squeezing out your potential like this?”

A chuckle sounded.

The white-haired man couldn’t help but open

his eyes. An extremely handsome man appeared in

front of him. He subconsciously frowned. Han Jue stared at the white-haired man with

a faint smile.

This white-haired man was the evil devil that

Han Ling coveted. He was the strongest talent born in the Ultimate Origin World and was even stronger than the Great Dao Fiendcelestials.

The white-haired man frowned and asked,

“Who are you?”

He didn’t attack because Han Jue made him

feel a sense of familiarity.

Han Jue sat in front of him and smiled. “It

doesn’t matter who I am. The point is that you’re in trouble. If this stalemate continues, you’ll reach the end sooner or later.” The white-haired man suddenly thought of

something and asked with an excited

expression, “You are… Grandpa Deity?” He was very excited.

Han Jue smiled and didn’t deny it.

The white-haired man’s potential was number one in the Ultimate Origin World and

he was blessed by the heavens. How could Han Jue not know? However, he didn’t specially take care of him. He imitated the

Heavenly Dao’s Chaotic Domain. Anyone with outstanding potential could enter the Chaotic

Domain. This was how he knew of Dao Sovereign and Zhao Xuanyuan. The threshold of the Ultimate Origin World’s

genius domain was extremely high. Currently, only the white-haired man could step into it. This person’s name was Dugu Wu. He was

already an orphan when he was aware of himself. Fortunately, he had awakened his bloodline and stepped into the domain of

geniuses. There, a wisp of Han Jue’s will taught him cultivation. Only then could he make a name for himself.

If not for Han Jue, no matter how talented

Dugu Wu was, how could he have relied on himself to cultivate until today?

It was precisely because of the opportunities

in the prodigy domain that Dugu Wu disdained the other factions.

Dugu Wu kowtowed excitedly. Han Jue smiled and asked, “You know it’s me

just by looking at my figure?” “Your aura is so unfathomable. No one can give me such a feeling in the entire Ultimate

Origin World. Grandpa Deity, can I call you Master?” Dugu Wu asked carefully. He was already a Great Dao Supreme. Not many people could resist him in the entire Ultimate

Origin World. However, facing Han Jue, he couldn’t resist at all.

It was definitely the person in his memories!

Han Jue smiled and said, “It’s been a long time since I took in a disciple.” “Master, please accept me as your disciple!”

“Do you know my identity?”

“I don’t know.”

“The Emperor who wants to snatch your

bloodline is my daughter. I created the Great Dao Fiendcelestials and the Nether Race who bullied you.”

“What?”

Dugu Wu was shocked and in disbelief.

Han Jue stared at him with a smile. His

expression changed. His emotions were extremely complicated.

[Dugu Wu has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 6 stars]

Dugu Wu looked at him and said, “Master, you definitely won’t harm me. To be able to create the Great Dao Fiendcelestials and the Nether Race, you should be the master of the Ultimate Origin World, a supreme existence. After thinking about it, if you also like my potential and your daughter has a way to snatch it, how can you not? The reason why you didn’t stop her is also a form of training

for me, right?”

Han Jue said, “The karma in this world is unpredictable. Enemies can become friends and vice versa. You’ve been wandering alone

for so long, you should be able to sense your problem. Actually, you didn’t have to do this.” At first, the Great Dao Fiendcelestials had recruited Dugu Wu, but he was disdainful and spoke arrogantly, infuriating the other party. Therefore, they spread rumors, causing all the Great Dao Fiendcelestials to take their anger out on him. He couldn’t be bothered to explain as he yearned to fight.

As time passed, Dugu Wu became the entire

Ultimate Origin World’s enemy. Dugu Wu was silent. He let down his guard in front of Han Jue and sighed.
