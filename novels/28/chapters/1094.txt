Chapter 1095 700 Quadrillion Years of Value

Han Jue couldn’t be bothered by that future Dao Creator. It was a good opportunity to let this fellow stimulate the Great Dao

Immeasurable Calamity. If he forced the other Dao Creators to attack, it would also be a lesson for this fellow to not underestimate them.

It was very difficult to judge a Dao Creator’s strength unless they fought. After all, the Dao Creator would not die and was at the highest realm. Under such circumstances, anyone

could become arrogant.

Han Jue continued to observe the Chaos as if he was watching a drama. Every good friend of his had already become involved in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Even his Dao Companions were affected by karma. It was mainly because of the teleportation function of the Dao Field and the Myriad Worlds Projection, causing information transmission and contact to be more frequent.

Among them, Li Yao had even been to the Primordial Chaos and seemed to want to

participate in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.

Whatever.

Save one or a hundred.

In any case, Han Jue had already gathered their soul fragments. They could revive.

Han Jue watched for a while and then focused on cultivating.

The situation in the Chaos became more and more intense. Supreme karma was enveloping all living beings, causing their hostility to increase. The higher their cultivation level, the greater the impact.

Any conflict could be magnified under the supreme karma’s influence.

The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was about to erupt.

…

In the Primordial Pool.

Figures stood by and watched as countless cultivators lined up opposite the pool.

Cultivators jumped into the Primordial Pool one after another, less than ten breaths of time apart.

Ji Xianshen sighed. “Even I want to jump down.”

The Chaotic Heavenly Dog chuckled. “Jump. I think your potential is quite ordinary.”

Ji Xianshen glared at it.

Zhao Xuanyuan asked curiously, “Why isn’t Master Chicken here? It’s rare for the Hidden Sect to act together.”

Dao Sovereign said disdainfully, “It’s just a coward. Other than the Chaotic Assembly, when has it ever come out? It won’t dare to come out even if we promise to protect it.” The others teased the Black Hell Chicken. The Chaotic Heavenly Dog was indignant and kept arguing for injustice, but it couldn’t win

against everyone.

After chatting with the Black Hell Chicken for a while, Jiang Yi asked, “Where’s Han Huang? When will he take action? Currently, there are already a trillion Demon Soldiers and more than a hundred million Primordial

Cultivators. He’ll definitely be able to overturn the Chaos with the Hidden Sect’s

support.”

Fang Liang raised his hand. There seemed to

be a wisp of green smoke in his hand, and he seemed to be playing with it. He chuckled and said, “The calamity has yet to arrive. You should be able to sense that karma power. Although it’s here, it’s not powerful enough. At least, it’s not enough to make us go mad.”

Everyone nodded in agreement.

It was indeed not enough.

At this moment, the Primordial Pool surged violently, startling the cultivators who were about to jump down.

The Primordial Pool was very big, even larger than the entire Immortal World. After the surface of the pool churned, it was extremely dangerous and terrifying.

Everyone looked over and saw a terrifying

giant shadow faintly discernible at the

bottom.

“What’s that?” Ji Xianshen asked.

Long Hao said excitedly, “It’s Primordial Despair. Han Huang told me before that other

than transforming Primordial lifeforms, the Primordial Pool’s also nurturing a killing

weapon.”

Primordial Despair?

Everyone looked at each other. They carefully

sensed the Primordial Despair’s aura and discovered that it was rapidly becoming

stronger.

The cultivators who had witnessed Primordial

Despair were so frightened that they didn’t

dare to jump down anymore.

“What’s that?”

“Did all the cultivators who jumped down

feed this thing?”

“That’s not right. Someone did come out

alive.”

“What a terrifying killing intent. Even an ancient ferocious beast is far inferior.” “This ferocious beast can definitely harm the

Chaos!”

The cultivators who could come here were

already prepared to be enemies with the

Chaos, so they were very excited after calming down.

The stronger the Primordial Chaos was, the

more it proved that their choice was correct.

Most cultivators came with the philosophy of promoting the Endless Era. Otherwise, it would be very difficult for the Primordial Chaos to have its current power. Although the living beings of the Chaos knew

about the Endless Era, they did not want to

die.

In addition, the Endless Era did not necessarily have to sacrifice the Chaos! The personal disciples of the Hidden Sect sighed at the Primordial Despair’s birth. Although Han Huang was arrogant, he did not

act recklessly. Instead, he was frantically accumulating strength. Just this Primordial

Despair was enough to make all the living

beings in the Chaos shiver. Time passed.

The cultivators continued to jump down after

the Primordial Despair calmed down. They were pleasantly surprised to discover that the Primordial Despair was only hiding at the bottom of the Primordial Pool and did not

hurt them. They were even more relieved.

Han Jue was immersed in cultivation and couldn’t extricate himself.

When the Chaos was about to encounter the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, the Ultimate Origin World also stirred up the Ultimate Origin Immeasurable Calamity and swept through the entire Great Dao World. It

looked like the Ultimate Origin World was in chaos, but to the three supreme factions, it was still under control.

The chaotic battle of all living beings would

cause the rules to become chaotic, but as time passed and peace returned, the rules would be

more stable than before. They could make up for many shortcomings in the past. This was the effect of the calamity.

Not only did the calamity reshuffle the various levels of the Ultimate Origin World, but it also constantly found the right path in

the chaos. It used providence to nurture the rules and used the rules to help create creation. Because of this, the Ultimate Origin World kept flying.

After a certain period of time.

A roar woke Han Jue up.

“I am the Primordial Fiendcelestial, Han

Huang. From today onwards, I will announce

to the Chaos, Transcendent, Consciousnessless, and Shi Tian that the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity has arrived. I will use the Conquest Spear to destroy the Chaos and create an Endless Era.

You can also make your last futile struggle for the meaning of your existence! “Primordial Chaos, listen up. With the

Primordial Chaos as the center, we will fight in the Chaos. If we encounter life, we will kill. If we encounter souls, we will slaughter them all. We swear to die!”Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Han Huang’s voice resounded throughout the Chaos, echoing for a long time. Even Han Jue’s Dao Field echoed with his

voice.

Han Jue could feel that Han Huang had become stronger. According to the system value, he would have to spend at least 700

trillion years of lifespan to deduce him, and he was getting closer and closer to becoming a Dao Creator.

How strange. This kid’s Primordial World was

not strong, and it was even chaotic, but his

strength was increasing.

Could this be the supreme karma of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?

Interesting.

Han Jue checked his attributes panel. He was

already 430 million years old, which meant

that he had been in seclusion for more than 20 million years. He started checking his emails.

Shan’e said excitedly after seeing that he opened his eyes, “Progenitor, Ancestor Han Huang is too domineering. Even I want to fight for him. So far, few enemies dare to attack Ancestor Han Huang. I can’t even find a target to curse!”

Han Jue ignored him.

“By the way, Ancestor Han Ling also wants to

deal with him. Do I need to curse her?”

Han Jue glanced at him. Shan’e shivered in fear and smiled

awkwardly. “I understand, I understand…” What nonsense!

How can you curse my precious daughter?

Han Jue didn’t say anything and continued to check his emails.

Shan’e didn’t dare to disturb him anymore.

He continued to look at the Chaos and

trembled in excitement. With Han Huang’s declaration of war, the

Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity officially

arrived!

The Great Dao Supremes of both sides were the first to collide in the space above the three thousand Great Dao. Ji Xianshen, Dao Sovereign, and the others all participated. Nearly a hundred Great Dao Supremes fought chaotically, causing the three thousand Great

Dao to tremble.
