Chapter 1170 Revival of Despair RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The new creation had rules, bloodlines, races, immortal realms, special space-time, and so on, causing the Endless Era to become even more exciting.

Han Jue took in everything and sighed.

There were really opportunities everywhere. It was good to be born in such an era.

Han Jue suddenly raised his eyebrows.

With more geniuses, the atmosphere changed.

Many geniuses even began to fantasize about challenging the Lord!

Han Jue had not shown his divinity in front of all living beings for billions of years, causing the junior geniuses to think that he was not all that. Naturally, some arrogant people appeared. Han Jue only snorted.

“I’ll give you a chance. I’ll make you despair in the future.”

Han Jue’s eyes flickered. He began to look forward to the feeling of showing off in front of these geniuses.

He stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple to visit his Dao Companions and children. He rested for thousands of years before continuing to cultivate.

Now, even if he did not cultivate, the Ultimate Origin World could develop on its own and help him increase his cultivation. However, his cultivation would increase even faster if he cultivated.

Dao Mystic Realm, in the void.

Chu Xiaoqi sat down. He trembled and his head twisted crazily. It was so fast that he formed afterimages. A terrifying demonic shadow could be vaguely seen.

Chen Jue stood in the distance and frowned at him.

“What’s going on? Why did his karma power lose control?”

Chen Jue was puzzled, but he did not dare to disturb him. The current Chu Xiaoqi was stronger than him.

The two of them had cultivated in this void for hundreds of thousands of years, but Chu Xiaoqi suddenly lost control today. His Dharmic powers became extremely irritable and even space shook. This void seemed to shatter at any other time, forcing Chen Jue to stabilize it.

Three figures appeared behind Chu Xiaoqi at this moment. Their bodies shone with a strong light as they attacked together and pressed down on his back.

“Stop!” Chen Jue shouted angrily and flashed in front of Chu Xiaoqi. His Dharmic powers erupted and countless golden sword shadows burst out from his eyes, wanting to destroy the

three mysterious figures.

However, the golden sword shadow passed

through three figures harmlessly. It was as if it

passed through shadows.

The figure in the middle smiled and said,

“We’re helping him. Do you know his

identity?”

Chen Jue asked in a low voice, “Who are you?”

The figure on the left smiled teasingly. “This brother of yours is not simple. Have you heard of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity? He played a very important role in it.”

Chen Jue’s heart was filled with uneasiness. He did not answer and continued to cast spells. However, no matter what Mystical Power he used, he could not hurt the three mysterious figures. He tried to move Chu Xiaoqi, but the latter’s Dharmic powers were too ferocious.

He was shocked. Although he was not Chu Xiaoqi’s match in the recent spar, it was not to the extent of being unshakable.

Could this kid really be the reincarnation of some mighty figure?

However, they were already perfected Great

Dao Supremes. Could it be that Chu Xiaoqi was the reincarnation of a Dao Creator?

“His true identity is Primordial Despair. He’s the number one ferocious devil of the Ancient Era. He once devoured more than a thousand Great Dao Sages and countless small worlds,” the figure in the middle said with a sigh.

Chen Jue was stunned.

Primordial Despair!

He had naturally heard of this name. Primordial Despair had once brought despair to all living beings before the Endless Era arrived.

At that time, all Chaotic mighty figures joined forces to stop Primordial Despair. It could be said to be the most terrifying ferocious devil since ancient times.

Chu Xiaoqi suddenly opened his eyes. They were blood-red, and his face quickly became sinister. He slowly stood up and his blood Qi exploded, covering his robe. The blood wind wreaked havoc in all directions and tore cracks in the void. Space-time hurricanes surged over. The space in front of Chen Jue shattered. Chu Xiaoqi and the three mysterious figures fell into the darkness and disappeared.

Chen Jue immediately chased them. He was struck by a mysterious and powerful force as soon as he entered the spatial turbulence. His body was instantly destroyed and he felt dizzy. He felt that everything was spinning.

He discovered that he was lying in ruins when

he regained consciousness.

This was a city in the mortal world. Because of

his fall, the entire city collapsed and all the living beings died.

Chen Jue stood up. His body had already recovered. He was about to move when wisps of black aura wrapped around his limbs. He looked down and paused.

Chu Xiaoqi’s power of karma!

The mysterious power that attacked him earlier was Chu Xiaoqi’s power?

But it was clearly so unfamiliar…

Could that be the power of Primordial Despair?

Chen Jue gritted his teeth and disappeared. He quickly went to find Formless World. Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue were both top

existences in the Dao Mystic Realm and were deeply favored by Formless World. Chen Jue thought of him first since he had a Dao Creator

as a backer.

In the hall.

Formless World frowned after hearing what Chen Jue said.

That kid was actually Primordial Despair…

Distant memories surfaced in his mind, causing his heart to shiver. Primordial Despair had traumatized him back then, making him afraid just thinking about it.

Chen Jue said, “Those three mysterious existences definitely want to use Chu Xiaoqi. Perhaps he’s not Primordial Despair and has only obtained its power.”

Formless World said, “I know about this. I’m

going to visit the Great Deity now. Don’t interfere anymore, lest something happens.” With that, Formless World vanished.

Chen Jue left.

He couldn’t only place his hopes on him.

…

A hundred million years later.

Han Jue opened his eyes and called Han Huang,

who had been waiting outside the Daoist temple, in. Han Huang quickly walked in and bowed. Then, he looked up and asked, “Father, is Chu

Xiaoqi really Primordial Despair?”

Han Jue nodded.

Han Huang’s expression darkened. Han Jue knew what happened outside. Chu Xiaoqi had awakened the power of Primordial Despair. Because of the conflict between the

two forces in this life and his previous life, his consciousness fell into chaos. At this moment, he was delirious and was used by Ji Xianshen,

Heavenly Venerate Xun, and Fang Liang to devour Great Dao Worlds everywhere, causing all living beings in the blank domain to panic. They were elusive and difficult to track.

Han Jue smiled and asked, “What are you going to do?”

Han Huang said in a low voice, “Of course I’m

saving him. Father, I’m sorry. I disappointed you.

Han Tuo had found him and told him about Chu Xiaoqi’s childhood ever since the latter had become a demon and started committing sins wantonly. After hearing it, he realized that his father already knew his true relationship with Primordial Despair.

“That’s your business. You can decide for yourself. I won’t interfere, and the Dao Creators won’t make a move,” Han Jue said

calmly. Han Huang was not disappointed. He bowed again and left.

The battle between the three Primordial Chaos and Heavenly Venerate Xun officially began. Han Jue looked into the depths of the blank domain. His eyes turned cold.

“You want to use Primordial Despair to confuse others? You’re overestimating yourself.” Han Jue chuckled. The reason why Chu Xiaoqi awakened the power of Primordial Despair was precisely because of the Ninth Chaos’ mental

demon. This fellow even found Ji Xianshen, Fang Liang, and Heavenly Venerate Xun to secretly add fuel to the fire. Han Jue decided to make his move!
