Chapter 186 Three Pure World Cleansing-Nine Heavens

“I’m the son of the Heavenly Emperor! I’m the favored prodigy of the True Dragons! I even obtained the inheritance of the Great Emperor!

“Why should I lose!

“On what basis?”

Long Shan roared in his heart. The mysterious power in the depths of his bloodline was activated.

Boom! He erupted with a terrifying aura. Like a volcano erupting, he broke through the sword Qi and sword shadows, and the surrounding land was crushed into ashes.

High in the sky, Han Jue saw a silver pillar of light shoot into the sky, directly dissipating the Three Pure World Cleansing’s sea of Sword Qi.

Han Jue raised his eyebrows. This fellow gained a power-up? If this isn’t the protagonist’s treatment, what is?

However!

I love suppressing the protagonist! Han Jue immediately activated the Six Paths Dharmic powers and slashed out another sea of Sword Qi, layer after layer.

A total of nine layers of Sword Qi! This was what Han Jue had comprehended previously. He couldn’t increase the strength of the Three Pure World Cleansing, so it was better to increase the quantity. The nine layers of Sword Qi were equivalent to nine overlapping Three Pure World Cleansing!

This move consumed a lot of Han Jue’s Dharmic powers. If not for the fact that the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique was an Immortal Emperor’s cultivation technique, he wouldn’t have been able to squander his Dharmic powers like this.

Three Pure World Cleansing-Nine Heavens!

The Nine-Layered Sword Qi Sea quickly condensed sword shadows. There were countless of them, stunning all the mortals in the world.

Most of the mortals couldn’t see that it was Han Jue using a Mystical Power. They thought that it was an Immortal God preparing to unleash Heavenly Punishment and destroy the world.

“Oh my god, who can save us?”

“Why! Why do the Immortal Gods want to kill us?”

“What did we do wrong?”

“The Heavenly Dao is unfair!”

“Immortal Gods are heartless! Immortal Gods are heartless!”

All the living beings in the world were wailing. As the battle between Han Jue and Long Shan continued, it was difficult for the world to withstand the battle between Heaven Immortals. All sorts of natural disasters kept appearing

In the Numinous Palace, the immortals were also stunned by this move.

“Does this kid have unlimited Dharmic powers?”

“His comprehension of the Sword Dao is extremely deep.” “That’s not right. His Highness obtained the Great Emperor’s inheritance. Could this kid be the same?”

“His cultivation technique is not simple. Perhaps he also has an Immortal Emperor inheritance.”

“Not necessarily. His Highness is about to use his full strength!”

Long Shan ascended to the sky and widened his eyes when he saw the sea of sword Qi.

He felt helpless for the first time.

Who was this person? Was he really a Heaven Immortal?

No!

I can’t lose to someone at the same cultivation level!

Long Shan suppressed his uneasiness with anger. He raised his right hand, and the trident flew back to him.

With a shake of his body, he transformed into a ten-thousand-feet long white dragon. His face was ferocious and his fangs were sharp like blades.

His dragon eyes were bloodshot, like two huge beads of blood. Roaring, he charged at Han Jue.

The three-headed and six-armed Han Jue was expressionless. He gently waved his sword, and the billions of sword shadows condensed from the Nine-Layered Sword Qi Sea landed.

At this moment, Han Jue seemed to be the God of War who wielded the Heavenly Constellation and controlled the Heavenly Punishment.

Three Pure World Cleansing-Nine Heavens was basically the Heavenly Punishment!

Having transformed into a dragon, Long Shan couldn’t care less. He lost his mind and rushed towards Han Jue at full speed.

Millions of sword shadows descended. In the eyes of all living beings, the sky collapsed.

Boom! Boom! Boom…

Countless sword shadows landed on the white dragon, who roared and continued forward.

He only had eyes for Han Jue.

When he was less than a thousand meters away from him, he was still forced to the ground by the Three Pure World Cleansing.

Countless sword shadows fell like a torrential rain. Han Jue was high up in the rain and looked down coldly.

The white dragon wailed as it was pressed down on the ground again, enduring the pain brought by the Three Pure World Cleansing.

The entire mortal world shook!

Soon, the white dragon was covered in blood, and white bones could be seen.

Han Jue was expressionless, but he was panicking inside.

The Heavenly Emperor was still not speaking?

If this continued, he would really kill Long Shan!

In that case, he and the Heavenly Court would fight to the death. He wasn’t afraid. At most, he would escape. But then this world would be completely ruined.

No matter how strong he was, he couldn’t compete with the entire Heavenly Court.

At the same time.

The immortals in the Numinous Palace were also anxious.

“Your Majesty, isn’t it over?”

“His Highness can’t hold on much longer!”

“This child is clearly waiting for the Heavenly Court to react. Otherwise, His Highness would already be dead!”

“That’s right. He didn’t kill Giant Spiritual Martial God earlier as well.”

“I think we can accept him!”

Even the Literature Immortals started to change sides.

Han Jue’s talent was too amazing.

It would be a pity to kill such a prodigy, but letting him go would be even worse. The Heavenly Emperor’s eyes flickered, but he did not reply.

The Divine General stood calmly without trying to persuade the Heavenly Emperor.

Han Jue watched as Long Shan’s body was destroyed, leaving only his essence soul.

Long Shan only had 1 star of hatred towards him. At this point, his hatred had yet to increase.

He had decent morals!

“Join the Heavenly Court.”

A vast and domineering voice entered Han Jue’s ears.

Voice transmission technique?

Han Jue immediately understood.

[Detected that the Heavenly Emperor has invited you to join the Heavenly Court. You have the following choices:]

(1: Agree. Obtain the favor of the Heavenly Emperor, you can obtain a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.)

[2: Reject. Obtain the hatred of the Heavenly Emperor and the endless pursuit of the Heavenly Court. You can obtain a Mystical Power inheritance and a Supreme Treasure.)

Three lines of words appeared in front of Han Jue. When he saw the second option, he couldn’t help but be speechless. Han Jue asked in his heart, “What about the mortal world?”

“No more cleansing. The Heavenly Troops will retreat immediately.”

“I’ll join, but can you give me some time? I don’t want to ascend now.”

“Mm.”

“Alright, I agree to join the Heavenly Court.”

Han Jue stopped.

Three Pure World Cleansing-Nine Heavens vanished.

Long Shan’s soul lay in the huge pit, on the verge of death.

The Heavenly Troops heaved a sigh of relief.

If Long Shan died in front of them, they would all have to die with him.

At this moment, the Heavenly Emperor’s voice resounded through the world.

“This mortal world was infiltrated by the devils and should have been wiped out. However, someone stood out and used his aptitude to exchange for peace. Hopefully, everyone will remember his contribution today.

“Heavenly Troops, retreat! Restart the heavenly rules!”

The world fell silent.

All the natural disasters stopped as if a mysterious force was calming everything. Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. The Heavenly Emperor had indeed kept his promise.

(The Heavenly Emperor has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 3 stars]

[You chose to join the Heavenly Court and obtained a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.) The Heavenly Troops immediately left with Giant Spiritual Martial God’s and Long Shan’s souls. Han Jue followed and checked his interpersonal relationships.

The image of the Heavenly Emperor was very domineering. This fellow looked very similar to the Heavenly Emperor in Han Jue’s imagination.

In Han Jue’s opinion, the Heavenly Emperor should be high and mighty, like Qin Shi Huang, and not the weak Jade Emperor in Journey to the West.

(Heavenly Emperor: Cultivation unknown. Lord of the Heavenly Court, Immeasurable Emperor. He controls all the Immortals and Gods. His temperament is unfathomable. Because of your talent, he has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 3 stars]

What was the Immeasurable Emperor?

Han Jue was secretly curious.

He turned around and flew back to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.

The Jade Pure Sacred Sect was cheering because they saw Han Jue leave the mountain. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The person who saved the world and obtained the recognition of the Heavenly Court was their Deity Slaying Elder!

When he arrived at the Fusang Tree, the disciples were all pleasantly surprised. The Black Hell Chicken asked excitedly, “We don’t have to run anymore?”

Han Jue smiled and nodded. “Yes.”

The others surrounded him, each more excited than the last.

Fang Liang asked excitedly, “Grandmaster, are you going to the Heavenly Court?”

Han Jue smiled and said, “Not yet.”

Although he survived this tribulation, he didn’t want to go to the Heavenly Court immediately. It would be troublesome.

He had definitely offended many immortals in this battle.
