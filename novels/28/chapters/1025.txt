Chapter 1026 Chaos Rises, Extreme Rage Tyrant Star

Han Ling turned to look at him, vigilant. He said, “Senior, what can I do for you?”

She only respected Laozi in name.

Laozi said, “I see that your providence is extraordinary. You will definitely rule the Chaos in the future. The world that you want to create will be your Dao. What world you choose is extremely important for your future path. Don’t take the wrong path.”

“Thank you for your guidance, Senior!”

!!

Han Ling bowed respectfully and left.

Han Jue moved Han Ling back to the Dao Field after she left the domain where the three thousand Great Dao were.

Laozi muttered as he looked in the direction she left, “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is really impressive. His bloodline inheritance is unprecedented. Could it be that he has grasped some kind of rule?”

In the third Dao Field.

Han Ling sat beside Han Jue and kept complaining about Laozi, feeling that he was relying on his seniority to lecture people.

“What right does he have to teach me? Is his world very good? I don’t think he made a name for himself. In the past, he didn’t dare to offend the Dao Ancestor in the Heavenly Dao. Later, he couldn’t protect the Three Pure Sacred World. How ridiculous,” Han Ling said indignantly. Her cultivation level was similar to Laozi’s, but she was treated as a junior.

Han Jue smiled. “Other than the difference in essence, there’s actually not much of a difference between Great Dao Worlds. He just feels that if you govern the Great Dao World with benevolence, the path you take will naturally be great. If you rear the living beings of the Great Dao World and act recklessly, you will also do things without any worries.”

Han Ling curled his lips.

Han Jue changed the topic and asked her how the trip went.

Han Ling immediately became happy and said that she had already absorbed the power of the rules of the three thousand Great Dao and could create a new three thousand Great Dao in her Great Dao World.

The Great Dao was unique in the Chaos. There were no same Great Dao, but there was no such restriction across the Great Dao World.

Several hours later, the father and daughter entered cultivation.

The cultivation years in the Dao Field were extremely calm, but the Chaos surged. As more and more Great Dao Sages appeared, the accumulated conflicts began to erupt.

The Life faction began to bare its fangs. Huang Zuntian sent dozens of Great Dao Sages to use the domain of Life as the center and began to devour the surrounding Chaotic Domains.

The Northern Chaos Holy Lord used the Dao of the Emperor and began to attack the various domains, his might overflowing. Formless World, Great Heavenly God King, Universe Sage King, Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven, Evil Heavenly Emperor, Zhou Fan, Pangu, and the others also began to fight for supremacy.

They weren’t the only ones. Even the Great Dao Divine Spirits were involved.

The Ultimate God of Punishment did not stop them. It was obvious that he tacitly agreed.

The leader of the Divine Spirits tacitly agreed, so the Chaos was naturally in chaos.

Hundreds of thousands of years passed after the war. On this day, the Life faction’s Li Daokong fought Laozi. The two of them were originally master and grand-disciple. Now that they had become powerful enemies, it naturally attracted countless spectators.

This battle shook the world and alarmed most of the Chaos. Even Han Jue and Han Ling in the Dao Field were alarmed.

Han Jue only took a look and then went back to cultivating

Han Ling watched with relish.

It was mainly because seeing Laozi being taught a lesson made her inexplicably happy

on

This battle lasted for several days. In the end, the two sides fought to a draw. Li Daokong’s name spread throughout the Chaos, and he was conferred the title of Sword Venerable!

The power of the Life faction reached an unprecedented level as Li Daokong’s reputation spread. The Life Lord who was one of the Ten Absolutes and the unparalleled Sword Venerable were two giants that shook the world and presided over it. All the factions targeted by the Life faction fled or directly surrendered.

More and more major factions began to fight for territory, startling many mighty figures who were still in seclusion. They didn’t understand what had happened and why the sky had suddenly changed.

They carefully deduced and discovered that all this chaos was caused by an existence!

Primordial Fiendcelestial!

It was unknown who had spread the news that the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was about to arrive. The strongest providence could transform into a Primordial Fiendcelestial and create the Primordial Chaos in the Chaos. It could surpass the Chaos and obtain an unprecedented supreme status!

At first, the mighty figures felt that it was just a rumor. But later they went to the Seven Supreme Rules and deduced them. They discovered that the rumors about the Primordial Fiendcelestial were true!

Whoever had the strongest providence would be enlightened by the Seven Supreme Rules and advance to a Primordial Fiendcelestial when the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity arrived!

For a time, the entire Chaos went mad. The higher one’s cultivation level was, the crazier it became!

In the blink of an eye, another five million years passed.

Han Jue opened his eyes and looked happy. He finally saw a possibility of breaking through.

He was only close to breaking through a minor realm after twenty million years. The Dao Creator Realm was deep and difficult to break through.

Many domains in the current Ultimate Origin World had also become lively. The Ultimate Origin World itself was also constantly expanding, looking like it was catching up to the Chaos. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The addition of ten thousand Nether Race members was very useful for the advancement of the Ultimate Origin World. They had always stayed in the Hundred Peak Immortal River, so they were extremely proficient in teaching and preaching. Therefore, they preached everywhere in the Ultimate Origin World and were already known as the Divine Race.

Han Ling asked when she saw that he opened his eyes, “Father, is that Li Daokong really from our Hidden Sect? Can you tell me about him?”

Clearly, the battle between Li Daokong and Laozi millions of years ago had stunned her.

She had always thought that she could dominate the same realm by relying on the Emperor Soldiers. Now, she discovered that the other mighty figures also had impressive methods.

Her Emperor Soldiers only had Dharmic powers, but they did not have Mystical Powers or the power of the Great Dao.

Of course, she still felt that she could defeat Li Daokong, and it was not difficult. It was just that she had other plans.

Han Jue smiled and recounted Li Daokong’s past. Han Ling listened carefully.

After Han Jue finished speaking, Han Ling suddenly sighed. “It’s really not difficult to dominate the Chaos with the Hidden Sect’s foundation. It’s just that Father likes to cultivate and doesn’t like to fight for hegemony. Otherwise, the Chaos would have long been surnamed Han.”

Han Jue asked, “Is Ling’er ambitious?”

She was born to be an Emperor. As Han Ling’s cultivation level reached the peak of the Chaos and it was very difficult for her cultivation level to advance, her ambitions naturally began to grow.

Han Ling hurriedly shook her head. “No, I’m just curious. The Chaos is extremely lively now. From time to time, Great Dao Sages and even Great Dao Supremes fight.”

Han Jue smiled and didn’t expose her.

The Chaos was indeed lively. There must be a trap behind this, but Han Jue didn’t care.

The Endless Era was what all the Dao Creators wanted to see. He naturally would not stop it.

“There are still two more Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempts. Should I use them to add some fuel to the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?” Han Jue thought silently.

He discovered that Han Ling was a little arrogant and did not think highly of the living beings in the Chaos. This was not good.

He should give her some pressure by using the Creation Heaven’s Chosen!

(Ultimate Rage Tyrant Star: Innate Great Creation. It contains the pity of the Ultimate Origin Transcendent Rule. He can borrow the power of the Ultimate Origin Transcendent Rule. The angrier he is, the stronger the power of the Transcendent Rule he borrows.]

Han Jue was stunned.

Han Huang…

Isn’t this Great Creation the same as borrowing his father’s power?
