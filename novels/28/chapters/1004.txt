Chapter 1005 Jiang Gongming, Deducing Son

The mighty figures in the hall also sensed it when Ten Absolute City was isolated by a mysterious array formation.

They looked at the Ultimate God of Punishment and Han Jue.

The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “Continue watching.”

The mighty figures could only suppress their uneasiness and continue watching the battle. However, they were secretly sending voice transmissions and asking their subordinates to investigate the situation.

Soon, the cultivators in Ten Absolute City also sensed that something was wrong.

“What’s going on? I can’t leave the city!”

“Could it be that they’re afraid that we’ll interfere with the Eternal Peak battle?”

“That’s not right. I can’t sense the aura of the battlefield at all. This means that it’s not at the bottom of the Chaos!”

“The Ultimate God didn’t speak. Nothing should happen, right?”

“Don’t panic. 90% of the major factions of the Chaos are gathered here. How can anything happen?”

In the courtyard.

The geniuses of the Hidden Sect also began to discuss this matter.

The Black Hell Chicken shouted, “What are you afraid of? With Master around, nothing will happen even if the sky collapses.”

Han Tuo and the four Divine Punishers looked at each other. They smelled danger. This was their intuition after countless years of experience in battles.

Li Xuan’ao said, “The battle at the top of the world is still ongoing, which means that it’s fine. Otherwise, the battle will be stopped.” The others nodded and focused on the sky.

Formless World, Han Huang, Huang Zuntian, Murong Qi, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, and the Great Heavenly God King were still fighting. Countless Mystical Powers were being hurled around. The scene was extremely chaotic, but it was also filled with visual shock. The cultivators in Ten Absolute City watched with relish.

This chaotic battle was too passionate and entertaining. It far exceeded the previous one-on-one battles.

At the same time.

Azure Heaven Mystic, who had been possessed by the Number One Deity, arrived in front of the Ten Absolute City. He raised his right hand, and an endless black aura rushed out from his palm and soared into the sky. It pierced through layers of space through the Chaotic Void. It surpassed the three thousand Great Dao and arrived under the Seven Supreme Rules.

The black aura condensed into a black pillar of light. Figures rushed out of the black pillar of light. They were the Destruction Authority Generals.

Soon, the number of Destruction Authority Generals exceeded 100,000. They attacked the Seven Supreme Rules crazily. The new Destruction Authority Generals also attacked. The Seven Supreme Rules trembled violently as the three thousand Great Dao fell into chaos.

In the hall.

Many mighty figures looked up. They all panicked when they saw the Destruction Authority Generals attacking the Supreme Rules.

Their

power was based on the Chaos. If the Chaos collapsed, even if they could live, they would lose their power and status.

“Ultimate God! Heavenly Sage! Look at theFôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Supreme Rules!”

“Could it be that the worlds below the Chaos

have begun to take action?”

“What should we do?”

“Ultimate God, why aren’t you doing

anything!”

“Those things look familiar. Isn’t that Dao Sovereign’s Mystical Power?”

The other Great Dao Sages began to panic even though they could not see the situation above the three thousand Great Dao.

The Ultimate God of Punishment’s clone said, “Go and protect the Supreme Rules!” With that said, the Great Dao Supremes

quickly vanished.

However, they were stopped above Ten Absolute City, unable to break through the

array formation.

They panicked even more and used their full strength to break the formation. For a time, the entire Ten Absolute City began to shake violently. All the living beings looked up and saw the mighty figures trying to break the formation. They immediately realized that

something was wrong with the formation! For a time, there were all sorts of guesses in Ten Absolute City. Some even cogitated that the Ultimate God of Punishment wanted to harm them.

Dao Sovereign and the other three were silent. They didn’t explain to their fellow disciples and watched as the wind blew and the clouds surged.

A Great Dao Supreme returned to the hall and said anxiously, “Heavenly Sage! Ultimate God! Please do something, or we won’t be able to break through the formation!”

The Ultimate God of Punishment frowned and said, “I’m only a clone and don’t have my true strength. I’ll accompany you first!”

He followed and prepared to act.

Han Jue hesitated.

Should he act?

Would it be pretentious? After all, the Ninth Chaos definitely knew his strength. Although the array formation outside was strong, even the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit could easily break it.

No!

In the Ninth Chaos’ opinion, he should not be able to defeat the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit.

Then, let’s act.

Han Jue stood up and said, “Ling’er, stay here and don’t walk around.”

He followed them to the sky above Ten Absolute City. The mighty figures worked together to break the array formation, but

they couldn’t move it at all. Han Jue discovered that this array formation was indeed impressive. It was very difficult to break through with a Great Dao Supreme’s strength. At the very least, one had to be half-step into the Creator Realm to have hope. As expected of the Chaotic Consciousness.

He carefully controlled his Dharmic powers and waved his palm.

On the other side, in the Consciousnessless Great Dao World.

Huang Zuntian’s expression changed drastically. His Great Dao Providence Divine Authority quickly dissipated, causing his

Dharmic powers to decrease.

The Great Heavenly God King found an opportunity and shot out a bone truncheon. It pierced through Huang Zuntian’s chest and nailed him to the ground. Immediately after, bone weapons rushed out from the bone truncheon and surrounded Huang Zuntian. They raised their weapons and stabbed them into the ground. Ghost aura spread and formed a sealing formation, preventing

Huang Zuntian from moving. “Damn it… Why is this happening…” Huang Zuntian gritted his teeth, not understanding why the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority had suddenly failed.

The Great Heavenly God King did not pity him. He appeared above him and gathered all his Dharmic powers in his palm, preparing to

end Huang Zuntian.

The Ultimate God of Punishment immediately sent Huang Zuntian out, indicating that he

was eliminated.

At this moment, the attention of the entire Ten Absolute City was already attracted by the mighty figures attacking the array formation. Huang Zuntian’s elimination only disappointed his supporters.

Azure Heaven Mystic stood outside Ten Absolute City looking at the mighty figures above with a mocking expression.

He said loudly, “Everyone, show yourselves!” With that said, thunderclouds suddenly appeared and enveloped the entire bottom of the Chaos. The mighty figures above Ten Absolute City stopped, including Han Jue. They looked up and saw a faintly discernible mighty figure appear in the thundercloud. It was even larger than the entire Ten Absolute City. The part of its body that was revealed was enough to make people despair.

Han Jue immediately used the simulation trial to check his surroundings.

[Formless Transcendent Deity: Early-stage

Dao Creator, Chaotic Deity, Above Order,

Transcends Everything.]

It was him!

The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s backer! Han Jue showed a frown.

The aura emitted by the Formless Transcendent Deity was extremely terrifying.

At least, Han Jue felt that he was not his

match.

“Open!”

An extremely dignified shout resounded through the world. Immediately after, the entire bottom of the Chaos began to shake as the sky rose higher and higher.

To be precise, the bottom of the Chaos was decreasing!

The Ultimate God’s clone was moved. He turned to look at Azure Heaven Mystic outside

the city and asked with a voice transmission, “Fellow Daoist, what are you doing? Didn’t

you say that you wouldn’t hurt the living beings in Ten Absolute City?”

Azure Heaven Mystic replied, “Sorry, I have to wipe out all living beings if I want to truly

destroy the Chaos!”

The Ultimate God of Punishment’s expression

changed drastically. He couldn’t be bothered to scold him and sent a voice transmission to

Han Jue.

Han Jue was not surprised.

Very good. Since you’re so cruel, don’t blame

me for being heartless!

Han Jue comforted the Ultimate God of Punishment and asked him to keep an eye on

the Ten Absolute Geniuses below. Then, he waited for the Ninth Chaos to make a move.

Dao Creator VS Dao Creator.

Meanwhile, he had to face the mysterious

Number One Deity!
