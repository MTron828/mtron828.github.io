Chapter 165 The Tide of Geniuses, Han Jue’s Ambition

After Murong Qi left with Xun Chang’an, Yang Tiandong found Han Jue and expressed his intention.

Han Jue was caught between laughter and tears.

There were actually people fighting to take in disciples?

“Don’t tell me you want to take in a disciple to be your henchman and fight for the territory of the demons?” Han Jue asked with a faint smile.

Yang Tiandong was immediately embarrassed when he was seen through. He hurriedly waved his hand and said, “How is that possible!”

Han Jue snorted. “We’ll see in the future. There aren’t any good seedlings now. When I take in disciples, it has to depend on their aptitude. You better not go around taking in some trash.”

“Hehe, of course. I’m also afraid of trouble.”

“Get lost. You haven’t even reached the Void Amalgamation Realm. I’m afraid you’ll become the weakest disciple under me.” “Alright…”

Yang Tiandong left dejectedly. His cultivation level was indeed at the bottom. Fortunately, Xun Chang’an was still accompanying him.

Dao Comprehension Sword suddenly said, “Master, when can you arrange a disciple for me?”

It seemed fun to take care of a disciple!

“Do you want a male or female disciple?” Han Jue asked with a smile.

Dao Comprehension Sword chuckled. “A female disciple, of course. You have too many male disciples under you. I’m used to it. However, there are fewer female disciples. Ling’er usually focuses on cultivating and doesn’t like to chat with me.”

“You should be cultivating. Why chat?”

“No, I’m not saying that I like…” “Alright, we’ll talk about this when you reach the Mahayana Realm.”

Dao Comprehension Sword curled her lips, feeling wronged.

Han Jue liked to see her aggrieved look. She had the face of a cold goddess, but she looked like a little woman who had been wronged. She was actually quite cute.

“I’ll let you take care of the next female disciple.”

“Thank you, Master!”

Dao Comprehension Sword immediately smiled like a flower.

Han Jue felt like he was teasing a child.

Sigh.

I’m getting old.

For some reason, Han Jue felt that he was not as cold-hearted as before.

He had to consolidate his Dao heart!

Han Jue immediately took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing.

Three years later.

When Fang Liang returned, he visited Han Jue anxiously.

Arriving in front of Han Jue, he knelt down. He first bowed, then went straight to the point to tell him the story of him and the saintess of the demon race.

By chance, he saw a fish churning by the river. He walked over and placed the fish in the river, but he didn’t expect to obtain the favor of the saintess.

This saintess was severely injured by the enemy and could only hide in the form of a fish.

Seeing that the fish had been following him, Fang Liang felt that it was sentient and put it in a bamboo basket.

After discovering that the fish was extraordinary and was injured, Fang Liang used his spirit energy to treat it.

Han Jue listened with relish.

Fang Liang asked uneasily, “Grandmaster, can I marry her?”

Han Jue said, “If you really like her, there’s naturally no problem. However, you can’t let a woman delay your cultivation. Your goal is to become an immortal and not live a mortal life.”

Fang Liang heaved a sigh of relief. “I understand.”

Actually, he was also a little confused.

However, it was his first time encountering love. The other party was too fierce, causing him to be led by the nose.

For some reason, he felt that marrying and having children was not the life he should have.

His target was to be like Han Jue.

He wanted to live like his grandmaster.

After Fang Liang left, Han Jue didn’t think too much about it.

In his opinion, this was a calamity that Fang Liang had to face.

If he couldn’t see through the mortal world, how could he see through the Great Dao?

Han Jue had also fallen in love before, but that was in his previous life.

If a guy and a girl got together, they would only end up in trouble!

After entering the Reincarnation Earth Immortal Realm, Han Jue continued cultivating and strove to break through to the Heaven Immortal Realm as soon as possible.

According to Zhang Guxing, a Heaven Immortal might appear to clean up the mortal world. Han Jue was only an Earth Immortal and was not safe enough. When he was alone, the cultivation world was still bustling with heroes. Ji Xianshen of the Heavenly Immortal Manor began to slaughter fiendish cultivators everywhere. At the same time, he challenged the experts of the other Holy Lands and never lost. He stirred up an invincible wind.

A mighty figure sighed. “Geniuses should be like immortals!”

This sentence made the other geniuses follow suit. Instantly, the various sects in the world began to encounter the challenges of the geniuses.

It was the same for the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. Fortunately, they could handle it themselves.

Xiao Yao used his powerful strength to suppress several geniuses. This old blind man was indeed worthy of being the number one genius of the Heavenly Immortal Manor five thousand years ago.

Time flew.

Seven years later.

Ji Xianshen came again.

“Fellow Daoist Guan, come out and have a gathering. This time, it’s not a battle, but catching up. I have a fortuitous encounter for you.”

Ji Xianshen’s tone was a little cheerful. It was obvious that he was in a good mood.

Han Jue hesitated for a moment but still stood up to see him.

It was still that familiar forest.

When he saw Han Jue again, Ji Xianshen still couldn’t see through him.

“How strong is this fellow?”

Ji Xianshen cursed silently. He was already at the eighth level of the Mahayana Realm and had cultivated the Azure Thunder Sacred Body, but he still couldn’t see through Han Jue’s cultivation level.

Fortunately, he wasn’t arrogant this time. Otherwise, he would be embarrassed again. “What is it?” Han Jue asked.

Opportunity? Was he going to hand over a gift?

Did he want to acknowledge him as his master?

Han Jue found Ji Xianshen more and more pleasing to the eye.

As long as they gave him a gift, they were good people.

Ji Xianshen coughed and said, “I obtained a dream from an Immortal God. He came from the Heavenly Court of the Upper World. He’s a Heavenly General who is willing to accept me. At that time, if I ascend, I will become a member of the Heavenly Court.”

That’s it?

Han Jue frowned and felt dissatisfied.

So you’re showing off to me.

“Your strength is not bad. I can bring you along. When the time comes, you and I can fuse our swords and become the two strongest War Gods of the Heavenly Court. How about that?” Ji Xianshen asked with a burning gaze.

If he couldn’t defeat him, he would invite him!

Han Jue frowned and said, “Are you going to be a dog for the Heavenly Court?!”

When Ji Xianshen heard this, his expression instantly darkened. He said in a low voice, “What do you mean?”

He had good intentions, but in the end, he was scolded. If not for the fact that he couldn’t win, he would have attacked!

“You don’t know that the Heavenly Court might want to clean up the mortal world? As a genius of the Heavenly Immortal Manor, can you tolerate your hometown being slaughtered?” Han Jue said bluntly. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ji Xianshen frowned.

The Heavenly Immortal Manor had also received information from the seniors of the Upper World. They were the mighty figures of the Heavenly Immortal Manor who had ascended previously, asking them to ascend quickly.

Ji Xianshen also learned of this matter, so after receiving the Heavenly General’s invitation, he was very happy.

“What can I do? I can’t change the Heavenly Court’s decision!” Ji Xianshen suppressed his anger.

Han Jue said expressionlessly, “If the heavens want to destroy our human race, we cultivators should overthrow the heavens! If you don’t even have such a backbone, what will the Heavenly Court think of you there?

“When those immortals learn that your hometown has been slaughtered and you were indifferent about it, what will they think of you?”

Ji Xianshen’s heart ached.

He was born with an invincible heart. Han Jue’s words aroused his arrogance.

I want to be the strongest Immortal God. If I bow my head now, what about in the future?

Keep bowing down? Ji Xianshen clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. “Can the two of us overthrow the Heavenly Court?”

Han Jue said calmly, “We can’t overthrow it, but we will kill as many as they come! We can show our strength and let the Heavenly Court give up clearing the world for us!”

These words made Ji Xianshen’s blood boil.

Why hadn’t he thought of this before?

Could this be the reason why Han Jue was stronger than him?
