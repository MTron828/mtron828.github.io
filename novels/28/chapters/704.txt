Chapter 705 Old Brother Han

Han Jue was observing the Immortal World when Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice entered his ears, “Fellow Daoist Han, come to the Universal Hall.”

This fellow really knew how to read the mood.

Han Jue had no choice but to put the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone and the Book of Misfortune into the Primordial World. He multitasked and let them continue to fuse.

He followed them to the 33rd Heaven and entered the Universal Hall.

The Sages arrived one after another.

Indeed.

It was for the new Sage position.

As usual, Han Jue didn’t speak and watched the Sages fight.

Emperor Xiao said, “The Devil Race’s Sage position should be here soon. I’ve been waiting for countless years.”

Qiu Xilai said disdainfully, “Our Western Sect is also waiting!”

The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said in a strange tone, “The Human School originally had two seats. The Heavenly Venerate has worked hard and contributed greatly. He should think about the Human School, right, everyone?”

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du glanced at the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and was puzzled. How had he offended him?

Pan Xin said, “The Chaotic Heavenly Road needs Sages. This spot should belong to me.”

He thickened his face and asked for it directly.

For a time, the Sages began to fight and argue.

Shi Dudao stood up and left.

Li Daokong immediately followed. Soon, the pressure of the two Sages fighting came from the void.

Han Jue didn’t leave and looked at the Sages with relish.

He had already widened the gap between him and the Heavenly Dao Sages, including Pan Xin and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. None of them were a threat to him. Watching the Sages argue could add to his peaceful cultivation years.

After a while.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at him and asked, “What do you think, Fellow Daoist Han?”

Han Jue smiled. “You’re asking me? Then give it to me so that we don’t get into a dispute.”

The Sages were stunned and surprised.

This was not Han Jue’s style.

Qiu Xilai immediately said, “I think so, too!”

Sect Master Tian Jue said, “Fellow Daoist Han has contributed greatly to the Heavenly Dao. We should indeed reward the Hidden Sect with a Sage Seat.”

Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Fang Liang, and Huang Zuntian agreed.

Pan Xin was expressionless, but his heart twitched.

He was certain that these five Sages were definitely Han Jue’s lackeys!

There was also Li Daokong, who had just gone out, and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, who had been fawning over Han Jue. The seven Sages were all supporting Han Jue.

The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate also saw through it and immediately chose to support Han Jue. Sooner or later, he would have to take sides. He could accept following Han Jue.

In any case, the Heavenly Dao couldn’t be led by Pan Xin and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du!

Eight Sages…

Together with Han Jue, there were nine Sages!

Pan Xin’s heart skipped a beat. The situation was not optimistic.

He immediately looked at Han Jue and asked, “Fellow Daoist Han wants to fight with me?”

No matter how scheming he was, he could tell that Han Jue was the leader. If he gave in to him, the other Sages wouldn’t stop him.

He began to suspect if Han Jue had asked the Sages to scheme against him.

Han Jue said, “You really want it?” Pan Xin said, “Of course!” “Who are you going to choose?”

“There’s no fixed person for the time being.”

“That means no one is suitable on your side. Do you just want to occupy the position first? I recommend the Hidden Sect disciple, Dao Sovereign. Everyone should know his potential,” Han Jue said calmly and the Sages nodded.

Dao Sovereign was once the number one prodigy in the Immortal World. Now that he was a Pseudo-Sage expert, he was indeed qualified!

Pan Xin frowned. “The Chaotic Heavenly Road needs Sages to guard it. If you insist, send a Sage to the Chaos.”

The Sages were silent.

Han Jue also fell silent.

Who dared to go to the Chaos?

They would die after leaving the Heavenly Dao.

Han Jue was afraid of the Chaotic Deities and couldn’t go out.

Pan Xin said proudly, “You’re timid. Why do you want to fight with me? I’m also thinking for the Heavenly Dao. In the future, the Heavenly Dao will definitely face stronger enemies and also need the Sages to go to the Chaos to open up new worlds. Don’t delay the development of the Heavenly Dao for the sake of power.”

Han Jue smiled. “In that case, I’ll give it to you, but you have to choose someone from the Heavenly Dao.”

Pan Xin said, “Of course.”

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du added, “The new Sage position will be decided by Fellow Daoist Pan.”

Seeing that Han Jue had agreed, the other Sages naturally had nothing to say. The Sage Meeting ended.

The Sages left.

Pan Xin invited him to Pangu Hall as a guest, and Han Jue didn’t refuse.

The two of them came to the Pangu Hall and sat down. Han Jue could feel that the Pangu Hall had already activated the restriction and could block the prying of Sages.

Pan Xin sighed heavily.

Pretending to be puzzled, Han Jue asked, “Fellow Daoist Pan, you just obtained the position. Why are you sighing?”

Pan Xin said, “Fellow Daoist Han, I’m older than you and can be considered an old friend. Why don’t we call each other brothers? I’m suffering. You should have heard of my previous encounters. Now, I look powerful, but I’m being pushed forward without freedom. I want to repay the Heavenly Dao, but the Sages are always wary of me…”

He began to complain.

Hearing this fellow call himself brother, Han Jue couldn’t help but narrow his eyes. He hesitated if he should throw Pan Xin into the Primordial Heavenly Prison now.

“Brother Han, you must support me in the future. I know that the reason why you protected the Heavenly Dao is that you want to obtain the Heavenly Dao’s protection. I’ll protect the Heavenly Dao and the Heavenly Dao will protect you. If we join forces, we can definitely reach the Great Dao together!” Pan Xin said with great ambition.

This time, Han Jue took the initiative to give him the Sage position, allowing him to see hope.

If he could rope Han Jue in, he would have the final say in the Heavenly Dao!

Pan Xin was very excited just thinking about it.

Han Jue asked, “Why do you want to control the Heavenly Dao so much? I see that you really don’t have the talent to manage it.”

Pan Xin’s face didn’t go red and his heartbeat didn’t accelerate. He said, “Only then can I train. But in the end, it’s a choice. No matter how talented Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du is, his master is the father of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End!

“I’m different. I’m Pangu’s descendant. Protecting the Heavenly Dao is protecting Giant God Pangu!”

Han Jue asked, “What will you do after you unify the Heavenly Dao?”

It’s time!

Pan Xin suppressed his surprise. He felt that he was about to succeed!

He wasn’t in a hurry to answer. Instead, he thought for a moment and said, “Xuan Du’s idea of developing the Chaos is correct, but if the Heavenly Dao wants to truly gain a foothold in the Chaos, it still has to find a backer. While developing the Heavenly Dao, I will seek a huge backer for the Heavenly Dao, a backer that can intimidate the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. My initial goal is the ancient Great Dao Divine Spirit. Although the Great Dao Divine Spirit is at the same realm as the Great Dao Sages, those ancient Great Dao Divine Spirits all have the power to suppress the Great Dao Sages.”

Han Jue smiled.

Pan Xin smiled and asked, “Old Brother Han, you agree with me, right?”

Han Jue suddenly raised his palm and struck him.

Pan Xin did not have time to react and instantly froze. His Dharmic powers were sealed by the Great Change Sealing Palm and his soul could not escape his body. “You…”

Pan Xin widened his eyes in disbelief.

Without another word, Han Jue brought him to the Daoist temple of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.

Pan Xin was thrown into the Primordial Heavenly Prison. He glared at him, his eyes filled with confusion, fear, and disbelief.

He was confused about why Han Jue attacked! He was fearful of his strength!

He was in disbelief. Why could Han Jue directly suppress him?FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
