Chapter 255 Immortal Emperor Samsara, Legend of the Immortal World

“Immortal Emperor Samsara is illusory, but he often leaves behind his inheritance. He has a special method to make people his descendants. As for his origins, it has always been an unsolved mystery. In the future, you will be responsible for investigating this matter,” the Heavenly Emperor said casually.

Long Jun nodded but was still puzzled. He asked, “Could it be that someone in the Heavenly Court has become Immortal Emperor Samsara’s descendant?”

It was impossible for the Heavenly Emperor to investigate Immortal Emperor Samsara for no reason.

The Heavenly Emperor smiled. “That’s right. It’s not only the Heavenly Court. There are also the Divine Palace, Buddhist Sect, Demon Court, and even the Dao Sect. I suspect that Immortal Emperor Samsara is up to something.”

Long Jun was deep in thought.

The Heavenly Emperor didn’t say anything else and turned to look at the sky.

His eyes were filled with anticipation.

Ten years later.

Han Jue finally obliterated the Victorious Fighting Buddha’s soul. He heaved a sigh of relief.

Now, there was one less Emperor around.

With the Victorious Fighting Buddha around, Han Jue didn’t dare to cultivate, afraid that something would happen.

As for the Victorious Fighting Buddha’s body, Han Jue decided to keep it. After losing his soul, this body had no consciousness and could not move.

However, Han Jue could feel the terrifying power it contained.

However, he still had to be on guard to prevent the Victorious Fighting Buddha’s body from producing another soul.

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the enemy to relax. Fortunately, he had used the Heavenly Sword Dao to sever karma, so no one in the Buddhist Sect hated him now. It was already difficult for the Buddhist Sect to deduce in the Heavenly Court’s territory. In addition, it was impossible for the Buddha to keep staring at the Victorious Fighting Buddha. Han Jue had cut off the karma between the Victorious Fighting Buddha and the Buddhist Sect with lightning speed. It was equivalent to cutting off the surveillance video. Even the Buddha Ancestor wouldn’t know who had killed the Victorious Fighting Buddha.

They probably hated the Heavenly Emperor.

The more Han Jue thought about it, the more relieved he felt.

He began to check his emails. Recently, the Heavenly Court had been peaceful again. Most of his friends had not encountered any trouble. Only Ji Xianshen and Huang Jihao were grinding levels. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

He could finally continue cultivating!

Han Jue thought happily.

He suddenly thought of something and called Huang Zuntian in.

Dao Comprehension Sword was expelled by him.

Next was confidential information.

Huang Zuntian knelt in front of Han Jue, feeling uneasy. Han Jue said, “I’m prepared to let you ascend and join a force, just like before. Before that, if you have any needs, just tell me.”

Huang Zuntian was excited.

It was time to contribute!

Huang Zuntian said, “I don’t dare to ask for too much. Your preaching has already benefited me greatly.”

Han Jue thought for a moment and took out a Heavenly Peach. He said, “Take it. It can increase your cultivation level. After that, you can ascend directly. Think of a way to go to the outer seas of the Immortal World and join the Jie School. You should know what to do after joining them.”

Han Jue wanted him to go to the Buddhist Sect, but Huang Zuntian came from the Reroll World. The Victorious Fighting Buddha had died here, so it was impossible for the Buddhist Sect to not be wary. The Jie School was different. At the moment, Han Jue had yet to have any conflict with them.

However, he had a feeling that it would happen sooner or later.

Not to mention the conflict between the Jie School and the Heavenly Court, two cultivators from the Jie School had previously caused trouble in the Sword Dao River.

Han Jue had to be wary.

Huang Zuntian was excited. He hurriedly thanked him and took the Heavenly Peach.

Han Jue waved his hand and gestured for him to leave.

After a while.

Dao Comprehension Sword entered and asked curiously, “Master, do you still have any peaches left?”

Han Jue closed his eyes and said, “No.”

Dao Comprehension Sword was disappointed.

He continued to cultivate.

The Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique had the cultivation method of an Immortal Emperor, but there was no method to break through to the Deity Realm.

However, the Deity Realm was currently too far away from Han Jue. He didn’t have to think about it for the time being.

In the future, he might be able to rely on gathering all the Great Dao Fragments to obtain the method to reach the Deity Realm.

Rank One Immortal Emperor was not strong enough.

A Rank Six Immortal Emperor died so easily, let alone him!

He couldn’t be careless!

Han Jue thought silently.

In the netherworld, in an abyss.

Ji Xianshen leaned against the mountain wall and gasped. He tried his best to calm down and meditate.

A ball of black aura floated above his head. He smiled teasingly. “You’re really ruthless. Are you still going to continue killing? You’re only three thousand years old and already a Grand Unity Mystic Immortal. Such potential is top-notch even in the Divine Palace. You can relax.”

Ji Xian’s divine eyes did not open as he said, “I’ve never compared myself to the Divine Palace. My target is stronger.” “Oh? Who is it?”

“This person has no reputation, but his talent is definitely the number one in the myriad worlds. I want to defeat him forcefully the next time we meet!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ji Xianshen suddenly opened his eyes, which shone brightly.

Guan Yu!

Wait, no!

Cao Cao!

I will definitely defeat you!

Ji Xianshen was very excited just thinking about it.

The thought of Han Jue lying on the ground and looking at him in disbelief made him shiver in excitement.

Awesome!

He couldn’t think about it anymore!

Ji Xianshen adjusted his emotions and continued circulating his energy. The black aura suddenly said, “There’s a big fellow approaching. This fellow’s negative karma is extremely terrifying. He has probably devoured more than ten million souls. You have to be careful.”

Hearing this, Ji Xianshen immediately stood up and prepared to fight.

There were no clouds for ten thousand miles. Above the sea was an island.

On the island, there was a valley where hundreds of cultivators were meditating.

Xuan Qingjun was among them. She wore a Daoist robe and had an otherworldly aura. She stared at a middle-aged Daoist floating in midair.

A lecture that lasted for decades had just ended.

The disciples of the Jie School raised their questions one after another, and Xuan Qingjun listened quietly.

At this moment.

A male disciple suddenly asked, “Master, what’s the purpose of our cultivation? Why does the Jie School exist?”

The atmosphere immediately tensed up. None of the disciples dared to whisper.

They were also concerned about this.

Ever since the Jie School attacked the Heavenly Court hundreds of years ago and was wiped out, they had become a joke everywhere. Be it the humans, demons, or even other races, they were all mocking them.

The Jie School had once dominated the Immortal World. With their foundation, every disciple had ambitions. How could they be willing to be mocked?

The middle-aged Daoist said expressionlessly, “The Dao Sect is the foundation of the world. However, the Jie School has indeed committed too many sins in the past. Now, we’re paying our debts for our ancestors. After paying our debts, the Jie School will naturally return to its peak.”

The male disciple asked, “What about the grudge between the Jie School and the Heavenly Court?”

The middle-aged Daoist glanced at him and said, “It’s not time for revenge yet.”

The disciples began to whisper. “You should learn from your Eldest Senior Brother. Our lineage might look glorious, but among the disciples, we rely on your Eldest Senior Brother solely,” the middle-aged Daoist said calmly.

Someone asked, “Is Eldest Senior Brother about to reach the Emperor Realm?” The middle-aged Daoist said, “That’s right. He’s at the juncture of breaking through. He can reach the Emperor Realm in at most a hundred years.”

Emperor Realm!

The disciples were in an uproar and had looks of admiration.

Xuan Qingjun looked forward to it too.

Immortal Emperor!

To her and the other disciples, it was a supreme existence comparable to the Heavenly Dao!

Even in the entire Immortal World, Immortal Emperors were legends!

Xuan Qingjun sighed.

She knew that it was almost impossible for her to reach the Emperor Realm with her potential.

She couldn’t help but think of Han Jue. That kid’s talent was ridiculously strong. He should have the hope of becoming an Immortal Emperor. She wondered if she could live until that day.
