Chapter 339 Reversing Yin and Yang, Entering the Nine Nether Purgatory

Because there were countless vengeful spirits from the netherworld gathered in the Yellow Spring, Han Jue had to check the nearby strongest person every year to prevent terrifying experts from appearing.

Seven years later.

Han Jue habitually checked the nearby experts and was suddenly shocked.

[Zu Tu: Cultivation unknown, master of the Divine Palace]

Why was this fellow here?

Han Jue was nervous.

This was the strongest person in the current calamity!

This was the fellow who had opened the Nine Nether Purgatory.

This fellow made countless ghosts hide in the Yellow Spring. Could it be that he wants to do something big?

The appearance of Zu Tu caused Han Jue to not dare to cultivate, afraid that he would be discovered.

A million kilometers away, above the Yellow Spring, a black shadow floated in the air.

It was Zu Tu.

He scanned the surroundings and muttered to himself, “As expected, there’s no one. Previously, when my clone came, I didn’t notice it. I thought that my clone’s cultivation was insufficient, but it seems that the heavenly secrets might have been wrong.”

With that, he hid in the Yellow Spring.

In the next few years, Han Jue would see Zu Tu every time he checked.

This fellow stayed nearby and did not move!

Fortunately, the Hidden Sect Island could block the divine sense of a Pseudo-Sage. No matter how strong Zu Tu was, it was impossible for him to surpass a Pseudo-Sage. Otherwise, why would he need to enter the calamity?

An existence that surpassed a Pseudo-Sage would definitely be a transcendent being like Ancestor Xitian. The Immeasurable Calamity wouldn’t affect him at all.

In the blink of an eye, fourteen years had passed. Zu Tu finally made a move. “Vengeful souls of the Nine Nether, all of you are failures of the Immeasurable Calamity. I know that all of you are unwilling to accept this. I can’t do anything for you, be it cultivation, sect, or race. All of you will never be able to make a comeback. If you want to make a comeback, you can only kill your way back in the Immeasurable Calamity!

“I have also failed in the Immeasurable Calamity. I’m unwilling. I want to overturn the Heavenly Dao. I want to let those existences who claim to be the masters of all living beings know that we Postcelestial lifeforms are not pawns!

“With the Yellow Spring as the platform, all of you will follow me to break through the realm of living and dead to slaughter your way into the Nine Heavens to seize the chance of survival that belongs to us!”

Zu Tu’s voice was filled with motivation, causing Han Jue’s blood to boil. He could clearly sense the murderous aura outside Hidden Sect Island increase and rush into the sky.

Everyone from the Hidden Sect was also frightened and did not dare to speak, afraid that they would be discovered by the terrifying existence outside.

Boom

An earth-shattering boom sounded. Han Jue felt countless fiendish auras rushing out of the Yellow Spring

ere

They were vengeful spirits from the Nine Nether Purgatory. They all flew towards the top of the netherworld, with Zu Tu at the front.

Han Jue looked up. The dazzling light illuminated the netherworld, which had been in darkness. It became as bright as day.

A strange force suddenly descended. Han Jue felt inexplicably dizzy. He, who was at the Immortal Emperor Realm, was already like this, let alone the Hidden Sect disciples.

The disciples below the Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm collapsed to the ground. The Black Hell Demon Lord, Diamond Rage, and Duan Hongchen were alarmed and did not dare to say a word.

The netherworld was upside down!

Han Jue was shocked. What was this Zu Tu doing? He wanted to bring the vengeful spirit of the Nine Nether Purgatory to the Immortal World. Why was there such a huge commotion?

It was as if he wanted to overturn the two worlds…

Wait!

Overturn…

Han Jue thought of that legend and became even more nervous.

The reason why he came to the netherworld was to leave the battlefield of the Immortal World. If the netherworld became the Immortal World…

He didn’t dare to think too deeply. He covered the entire Hidden Sect Island with his Dharmic powers, prepared to escape at any time. “Hmph!”

A cold snort sounded.

Zu Tu’s voice sounded, “The calamity has already begun. Do you still want to stop it? Don’t forget the rules set by the Dao Ancestor!”

The deep voice sounded again, “Yin and Yang cannot be reversed. Other than that, I will not interfere!”

Zu Tu did not continue, and the mysterious force that made all the living beings in the netherworld dizzy vanished.

Han Jue narrowed his eyes and looked over. He saw a huge hole in the sky of the netherworld. There was a strong light shining in it, like a bright sun. Countless vengeful spirits rushed in one after another. Zu Tu floated under the hole and waited.

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that the two worlds wouldn’t be reversed.

There were really many mighty figures. Han Jue had never heard that voice in the Great Ultimate Hall.

Two hours later, Zu Tu left.

The netherworld regained its calm, and the murderous aura that filled the Yellow Spring also vanished.

Han Jue immediately called out.

Duan Hongchen entered the cave abode to greet him.

Han Jue said, “Do you know how to go to the Nine Nether Purgatory?”.

Duan Hongchen was stunned and said in horror, “Sect Master, you want to go in? Why!”

He had tried all means to escape from the Nine Nether Purgatory. He didn’t want to return.

Han Jue smiled. “Now that all the vengeful spirits are heading to the Immortal World, the Nine Nether Purgatory will definitely be empty. We can hide in it.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“But there’s endless negative karma inside. If you stay too long, negative karma will surround you and you won’t end up well.”

“It’s fine. I have a way to eliminate negative karma.”

“But…”

“Could it be that you want to enter the calamity?”

Duan Hongchen hurriedly shook his head. He had just revived when he encountered Han Jue, causing him to be very lacking in confidence now. He kept feeling that the Immortal World was very dangerous. Coupled with the encounter with the Black Hell Demon Lord and Diamond Rage, he didn’t dare to enter the calamity.

If even the Magus Race was slaughtered, how could he fight for providence alone?

Han Jue said, “Don’t worry. As long as you stay on the island, the negative karma won’t affect you. When the calamity is about to end, we’ll escape.”

Duan Hongchen gritted his teeth and said, “Alright, I’ll go take a look!”

Han Jue waved his hand and sent him out.

There was a Six Paths Insignia deep in Duan Hongchen’s soul. It was deeply rooted. If he betrayed him, Han Jue could destroy him with a thought, directly destroying his body and soul.

Soon, Duan Hongchen returned, and Han Jue moved him into the cave abode.

He almost couldn’t find Hidden Sect Island.

“What kind of formation is this? No wonder the mighty figure didn’t notice us.” Secretly shocked, Duan Hongchen was even more respectful towards him.

Han Jue asked, “How’s the situation?”

Duan Hongchen said, “The barrier is weak. We can indeed enter, but I’m not sure if there are still ghosts inside.”

“How do I enter?”

“If you keep going down, you’ll hit the barrier.”

“Alright!”

Han Jue directly controlled Hidden Sect Island to sink while Duan Hongchen waited in the cave abode.

“Could it be that this island has already been refined into a Dharma treasure?” Duan Hongchen was filled with surprise.

The Hidden Sect Island was like a stone as it quickly descended and collided with the barrier of the Nine Nether Purgatory.

Han Jue forced his way in and could even break out of the mortal world. It was naturally not difficult for him to break in.

The next second.

Hidden Sect Island came to an empty space. Boundless mist filled the surroundings. There were no stars, continents, or meteors.

It was as if chaos had just begun. Everything was void, even space.

The moment Han Jue entered, he felt terrifying negative karma. The surroundings of Hidden Sect Island were filled with it. Fortunately, the Dao Field was strong enough to withstand the invasion of negative karma.

If Han Jue absorbed all the negative karma here, then his cultivation…

Han Jue didn’t dare to think about it, afraid that he would lose his sense of reasoning.

He began to inspect the surrounding experts.

No vengeful spirits were around.

He immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

Indeed, the Nine Nether Purgatory was empty.

This was normal. It wasn’t easy for them to escape. Why would the vengeful spirits that had been suppressed for countless years stay?

Han Jue let Duan Hongchen out and told the disciples the exact situation.

At this moment, he sensed the divine sense fluctuation from the Heavenly Dao Token.

The Heavenly Emperor was contacting him.

Han Jue probed the Heavenly Dao Token with his divine sense.

“The netherworld has been destroyed. How are you?” the Heavenly Emperor asked in a low voice, clearly very worried about his safety.
