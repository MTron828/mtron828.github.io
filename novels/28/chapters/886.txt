Chapter 888 Jiang Gongming, Deducing Son

The five Divine Punishers looked at each other when the Ultimate God mentioned Pangu.

Pangu had already died several times. Unknowingly, he was no longer that powerful in the hearts of the living beings in the Chaos.

However, they did not expect Pangu to be able to sever karma, preventing even an existence like the leader of the Divine Spirits from spying on the Chaos. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

What a terrifying Pangu!

“Alright, you can leave.”

The Ultimate God of Punishment waved his hand. The five Divine Punishers bowed and quickly left.

The world fell silent.

The Ultimate God of Punishment meditated and cultivated. As he began to cultivate, a wisp of black aura appeared between his brows, making his face look very strange.

Ancestor Shen Yin’s death did not cause a stir in the Chaos because he was unknown.

The Chaos welcomed an unprecedented peace ever since the Ultimate God of Punishment took over. The peace was deathly silent and desolate in the past. Now, it was lively and prosperous.

All the worlds hidden in the past appeared and began to recruit geniuses to fight for domains, resources, and providence.

The most lively was the Chaotic Domain where the Heavenly Dao was located. The Heavenly Dao was the first world with perfect rules. Before this, the world was only tangible, but there was nothing special. The Heavenly Dao’s uniqueness made the worlds near it very prosperous.

......

The Heavenly Dao had already become the reliance of hundreds of worlds as time passed.

However, the Three Pure Sacred World created by the Dao Ancestor’s personal disciples at this moment, the Three Pure Sages, also rose. Under the domain led by the Divine Robe Daoist, the Heavenly Dao and the Three Pure Sacred World had already begun to compete in momentum.

Tens of thousands of Daoists meditated in a grand palace in the Three Pure Sacred World. They faced a direction, and two Daoists with extraordinary auras faced them.

One was the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning, and the other was the Heavenly Sect Master.

The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning had an Immortal Dao Bone and a sharp gaze. The Heavenly Sect Master wore a black robe and looked like a youth, but his body emitted a murderous aura that made people not dare to look at him.

The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning slowly said, “We can’t fight with the Heavenly Dao head-on. After all, the Heavenly Dao is our home. However, our unfilial disciple betrayed us and controlled the power of the Heavenly Dao himself. He offended his superior. I’ve decided to defeat the Heavenly Dao in the Chaotic Assembly and defeat the Heavenly Dao in terms of reputation before devouring it.”

The Daoists in the hall discussed.

“The Chaotic Assembly is a gathering of geniuses. It’s indeed important.”

“Although the Heavenly Dao’s foundation is strong, it has been suppressed for too long. In terms of the Heavenly Dao, there aren’t many Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals.”

“That’s right. How can the Heavenly Dao compare to us in the Three Pure Sacred World?”

“However, we can’t avoid the Divine Might Heavenly Sage if we want to touch the Heavenly Dao.” “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is powerful, but our Grand Pure Sage is not bad either.”

The Daoists discussed. They were very happy and couldn’t wait to compete with the Heavenly Dao.

The name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was indeed thunderous, but they had never seen the power of a Divine Authority General, much less the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. The Heavenly Sect Master snorted. “Divine Might Heavenly Sage. I want to see him.”

The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning smiled and said, “Junior, you can’t speak nonsense. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is indeed powerful. Besides, the Heavenly Dao and the Three Pure Sacred World will fuse together sooner or later. How can we be enemies?”

The Heavenly Sect Master glanced at him with disdain, but he did not reply.

At this moment…

An inappropriate voice sounded.

“What’s there to fight for? Do we still need to care about the Heavenly Dao if we obtain the peak of the Chaos?”

Everyone turned around. The person who spoke was a white-robed Daoist. He had a fair face and was very young. He looked to be only sixteen or seventeen years old.

He stood up slowly with an arrogant expression and looked down on all the Daoists present.

The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning chuckled. “Jiang Gongming, do you think it’s so easy to fight for the top of the world? There’s so much chaos that even we don’t know how big the Three Pure Ones are. There’s no limit to the number of geniuses.”

Jiang Gongming smiled. “I attained the Dao at a million years old and attained Freedom at ten million years old. I attained the Great Dao at 50 million years old. I will definitely dominate the Chaotic Assembly. Teacher, tell me, is there really someone in the Chaos who has a higher potential than me? I’ve never gone out on an adventure and I have never experienced enlightenment. I’ve cultivated on my own.”

Those Daoists who didn’t know Jiang Gongming were in an uproar.

Great Dao Sage!

The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning shook his head. “You’re indeed talented, but you lack experience. Many geniuses have appeared in the Heavenly Dao recently. For example, the three disciples of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage are already at the Freedom Realm before they reached ten million years old. Although they are affected by opportunities, their cultivation realms are true.”

Jiang Gongming frowned and asked in a low voice, “Who are those three?”

“Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi are currently cultivating with the Grand Pure Sage’s clone.”

Jiang Gongming frowned even more.

The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning said, “Gongming, get to know them and prepare for the Chaotic Assembly in the future. Remember, don’t become enemies. The Grand Pure Sage intends to nurture them, and they might be fellow disciples in the future.”

Jiang Gongming nodded unhappily.

The other Daoists also began to discuss Dao Sovereign and the other two. This made Jiang Gongming even more unhappy.

The Heavenly Sect Master stared at Jiang Gongming and smiled. It was unknown what he was thinking.

Third Dao Field.

Han Jue opened his eyes. His cultivation level had increased a little after a hundred thousand years. Although it was not much, he was indeed becoming stronger. He was very satisfied.

The expansion of the Primordial World still showed no limit so far. The stars in the Primordial World doubled in number after breaking through, as many as the lifespan of the origin.

The Turbid Yin World Destruction Worm was still in the Primordial Heavenly Prison. It would probably take some time. After all, it was worth a trillion years of lifespan.

Han Jue habitually checked his emails and checked his recent friends.

Some were beaten, some obtained opportunities, and new maps were unlocked.

Han Jue discovered that more and more names of the world appeared in the emails ever since the Ultimate God of Punishment took over.

This fellow was really wise from the looks of

it.

However, was the stronger the Chaos, the better it was for him, a Primordial Fiendcelestial?

Would the Chaos discover his son’s bloodline in the future and besiege him even if he surpassed the Primordial Fiendcelestial and his son inherited his bloodline?

Han Jue decided to deduce.

“I want to know the future of Xing Hongxuan’s son. Yes, let’s deduce how he dies.”

Han Jue thought silently. Calculating the time of death was the most direct. It would be a good thing if he couldn’t deduce it.

(10 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

‘Eh?’

Would he really die one day?

Han Jue frowned and immediately chose to continue.

He entered the illusion.

Han Jue opened his eyes and discovered that he was standing in a palace covered in bones. There were bones of all kinds of races, like purgatory. It was ghastly and terrifying.

He saw that the palace was vast. At a glance, there was a huge throne that was ten thousand feet tall a million miles away. It was coiled with dragon bones and looked like it was cast from iron. It flickered with a cold

light.

A figure was sitting lazily on the huge throne. He was ten thousand feet tall and looked like a child compared to the huge throne.

“This is my son?”

Han Jue narrowed his eyes and sized up the ten-thousand-foot-tall figure.

This child was actually wearing his Time Dao Robe. His black hair was tied up under a golden pearl crown. He had a handsome face and his eyes were blood-red. He was like an emperor who ruled all living beings as he looked forward lazily and stared indifferently in Han Jue’s direction.
