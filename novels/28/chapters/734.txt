Chapter 735 Kill!

Fighting the Great Dao Sages, the Despair Dao Spirit was not in a hurry to attack when he saw Han Jue. After all, there were so many Great Dao Sages blocking him.

Although the 23 Great Dao Sages did not gain the upper hand, he did not feel good either.

“I have to think of a way to lure him to fight me alone.”

Despair Dao Spirit thought silently. He raised his hand and pinched, scattering the terrifying flames that were ten million kilometers long.

The Great Dao Sages’ battle did not look too grand. Sages could also do it, but their Dharmic powers were focused. Every Mystical Power contained thousands of changes.

At this moment, the Despair Dao Spirit was hit by billions of illusion Mystical Powers, but he dispersed them one by one.

It was not only an illusion, but also the power of karma, killing Mystical Powers, and even negative karma.

While the Despair Dao Spirit was thinking of a way, the Great Dao Sages were also secretly thinking

Their anger towards the Despair Dao Spirit was true, but they did not want to really become mortal enemies.

No matter what, the Despair Dao Spirit was still a Great Dao Divine Spirit. Behind it stood the illusory Chaotic Deities. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The reason why they protected the Heavenly Court was that they were afraid that the Despair Dao Spirit would kill them.

If the Despair Dao Spirit could slaughter the Heavenly Court today, it would not be strange for him to slaughter their providence sects tomorrow. Moreover, if the Heavenly Court wasn’t destroyed, the fate of escape would definitely be targeted at the Heavenly Court.

“Divine Spirit, why are you targeting me?” Han Jue flew behind the Great Dao Sages and asked in a loud voice.

The Despair Dao Spirit stopped, and the Great Dao Sages also stopped. Neither side wanted to fight. After all, they were not their main enemies. There was no need to fight to the death.

The Despair Dao Spirit glared at Han Jue and said, “You don’t respect the Chaotic Deities or the rules of the Great Dao. After becoming a Great Dao, you haven’t contributed to the Chaos either. The heavens have rules, and the Great Dao also has rules!”

Great!

His chance was here!

He wanted to think of a way to make the Great Dao Sages leave and give him a chance to face Han Jue alone.

Han Jue gritted his teeth and said, “Just because of this? You won’t give me a chance to live?”

He displayed panic, despair, and anger.

The living beings of the Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower also panicked. Was Han Jue coming to beg for mercy?

The Evil Heavenly Emperor and Zhou Fan couldn’t help but look at Han Tuo reproachfully.

Han Tuo was stunned.

Did I really guess wrong?

Han Tuo’s heart instantly sank into the abyss. If his father was really killed, how would he spend the rest of his life?

“You want to live? Alright! I’ll give you a chance. Kneel down now and swear to the Great Dao to repent for your disrespect towards the Chaotic Deities!” the Despair Dao Spirit shouted. Then, he glared at the Great Dao Sages and cursed. “Why aren’t you retreating? I’m giving him a chance. Do you really want him to die?”

Hearing this, the Great Dao Sages fell silent. Even the Ancestral Magus Di Jiang did not speak.

Soon, the Great Dao Sages retreated.

They also thought that Han Jue was about to bow his head.

Despair Dao Spirit stared at Han Jue and said, “Come here! Kneel down to me!”

Under everyone’s gaze, if Han Jue was really willing to kneel, he didn’t mind taking him in as a slave.

However, he had seen Han Jue use the Grand Unity Aspect just now.

This fellow might be acting!

So what!

The Despair Dao Spirit was confident in himself. Han Jue had just attained the Great Dao not long ago and was not his match!

His previous actions were probably to protect himself. Crawlers always liked to resist fearlessly.

Han Jue pretended to be hesitant. After a while, he gritted his teeth and flew towards the Despair Dao Spirit.

Seeing him compromise, the Despair Dao Spirit couldn’t help but laugh.

He wanted to crush Han Jue’s psychological defense in this way.

The Great Dao Sages were expressionless and did not laugh.

If it were them, wouldn’t they be in the same situation when facing the Despair Dao Spirit alone?

They only felt endless sorrow.

Han Jue was getting closer and closer to the Despair Dao Spirit.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor sighed.

Zhou Fan and Chu Shiren turned their heads away. Han Tuo lowered his head and clenched his fists.

The entire Primordial Void fell into absolute silence.

Although Han Jue was still acting, he noticed that the power of despair was increasing. It was not just becoming stronger. This fellow was accumulating strength.

I knew it!

Despair Dao Spirit was not as arrogant and stupid as he looked.

However, Han Jue didn’t care.

The reason why he acted was to create an opportunity for the Despair Dao Spirit to stay!

If he directly attacked, the terrifying aura that erupted might scare the Despair Dao Spirit away.

The difference in cultivation was still there. If this fellow wanted to escape, Han Jue might not be able to catch up.

The Despair Dao Spirit also felt the power in Han Jue’s body. This child was trying his best to suppress it.

“So you’re acting and want to attack me?

“What a joke!”

The Despair Dao Spirit laughed wantonly as he condensed his Dharmic powers.

The two of them had the same thought. They wanted to kill each other in one strike!

Han Jue suddenly looked up and struck with his right palm when he was a hundred feet away!

Primordial Divine Rage!

After fusing with the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols and mastering it, it formed a powerful Mystical Power that could destroy the enemy in one strike!

Despair Dao Spirit also waved his palm. At this moment, time froze.

“You think you can resist me?”

The Despair Dao Spirit laughed angrily.

Han Jue immediately mocked him. “Many people have the same thoughts as you when facing me, but you don’t even have a chance to see them!”

Their conversation could no longer be defined by time. It was so fast that the Great Dao Sages could not capture it.

He slapped his palms at each other, and two terrifying Dharmic powers erupted!

A strong light burst out!

The Primordial Void trembled violently. All the living beings felt suffocated, especially those below the Great Dao Realm. They didn’t react at all and thought that Han Jue really wanted to surrender!

The Primordial Divine Rage that contained the power of 549 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols carried Han Jue’s anger and directly covered the Dharmic powers of the Despair Dao Spirit.

In an instant, the Despair Dao Spirit’s eyes widened. “Oh no!”

“How can this be?!”

“Why is he so powerful!”

“It’s over!”

Many thoughts flashed through his mind. He could no longer escape!

The Primordial Divine Rage drowned him with an extremely domineering aura!

Killed!

His body and soul were destroyed!

His Great Dao soul dissipated on the spot. He couldn’t escape in time!

The Primordial Divine Rage charged forward and created a spatial hole at the end of the Primordial Void, surging into an unknown domain.

The strong light dissipated!

The Great Dao Sages looked over and only saw Han Jue.

Han Jue’s Time Dao Robe fluttered in the wind. His face was cold and his eyes were still filled with killing intent.

The might of the Primordial Divine Rage was still there, causing the Great Dao Sages to shiver.

Despair Dao Spirit was dead?

Almost at the same time, the Great Dao Sages’ eyes widened and they trembled.

The disciples they brought, the immortals of the Heavenly Court, and the cultivators of the Great Dao Tower also came back to their senses. They couldn’t believe their eyes.

“Oh my god!” Yi Tian cursed. He was so excited that his face turned red.

The danger had been reversed?

He suddenly wanted to kneel down to Han

Jue!

Han Jue turned around and swept his gaze across the Great Dao Sages. His cold gaze made their Dao hearts beat wildly.

Just one look!

With a glance, Han Jue immediately came in front of Han Tuo and brushed past him. He patted his shoulder and stepped into the black vortex.

After the black vortex disappeared, the Primordial Void remained silent for a long time.
