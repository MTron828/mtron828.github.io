Chapter 879 Son of the Heavenly Sage

Qiu Xilai’s words were firm and powerful, immediately sweeping away the uneasiness in their hearts.

That’s right.

The Heavenly Dao had the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. What was there to fear?

“That’s right. With the Divine Might Heavenly Sage around, we don’t have to be afraid at all.”

“The Heavenly Sage has always been in seclusion, but he’ll definitely sense it if the Heavenly Dao is in trouble.”

“Speaking of which, even the Chaotic mighty figures didn’t dare to mistreat me when I mentioned my identity as a Heavenly Dao Sage when I traveled the Chaos previously.”

“That’s right. The development of the Heavenly Dao is already unstoppable. This time, we have to receive the Five Great Divine Punishers to show our Heavenly Dao’s magnanimity.”

The Sages discussed and the atmosphere became lively. The new Sages was very curious about the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.

To the recently promoted Heavenly Dao Sages, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was a legend. It was extremely mysterious and fascinated them.

The Five Great Divine Punishers arrived thousands of years later.

They entered the 33rd Heaven under Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s lead.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was secretly shocked.

......

The power of the Heavenly Dao actually did not stop the Five Great Divine Punishers. Why?

Pan Xin and Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s eyelids twitched.

The group arrived at the Universal Hall. The Sages gathered here. Their gazes landed on the Five Great Divine Punishers. They were all curious and did not bow.

Yi Tian glanced around and smiled. “The development of the Heavenly Dao is indeed not bad. There are already so many Sages.”

Fang Liang looked at him with a complicated expression.

Yi Tian was the reincarnation of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial obtained by the Heavenly Dao Spirit. It was equivalent to the reincarnation of the Heavenly Dao. Fang Liang, who had created his own Heavenly Dao Sect, naturally felt a sense of familiarity.

However, the current Yi Tian had already surpassed Fang Liang in both power and cultivation. The Son of the Heavenly Dao defeated the Heavenly Dao, so Fang Liang was naturally a little embarrassed.

Han Tuo’s gaze landed on Han Yu.

The two of them looked at each other silently.

Han Yu did not expect Han Tuo to be one of the Five Great Divine Punishers and be at the front.

Nas

Han Tuo was very glad to see Han Yu become a Sage, but he did not show it on his face.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du led the Five Great Divine Punishers to the front. The Sages sat down.

Han Tuo said, “I was born in the Heavenly Dao. I didn’t come with any special intention. You don’t have to worry.”

The words worry made the Sages nervous. The Divine Punishers smiled.

They had been out for some time. They would be nervous no matter who saw them. As time passed, they naturally developed arrogance.

Han Tuo was the same. The Five Great Divine Punishers had arrived, but the Sages did not bow. They were even more arrogant than the Great Dao Divine Spirits. This was not good.

Once the Heavenly Dao Sages developed a disdainful attitude towards the Great Dao Divine Spirits, it would only cause endless trouble for the Heavenly Dao. Today, he was leading the Five Great Divine Punishers. He could ignore it. But what if other Great Dao Divine Spirits came in the future?

They couldn’t always let his father clean up after them!

Han Tuo felt that there was a need to teach them a lesson to prevent these Sages from causing trouble again.

Pan Xin smiled and said, “We’re naturally not worried. We’re not afraid of anyone in the Chaos with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage guarding the Heavenly Dao.”

The other Sages smiled.

They were not afraid of offending the Great Dao Divine Spirits. They were already irreconcilable enemies. The current peace was just that the Great Dao Divine Spirits could not do anything to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.

Since they were enemies, why should they bow?

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I forgot to introduce you. This Divine Punisher is the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s son, Han Tuo.”

The Heavenly Sage’s son?

The Sages were moved.

Yi Tian chuckled. “My name is Yi Tian. I’m the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s Divine Spiritson.”

The other three Divine Punishers rolled their eyes. This fellow was too shameless. He was really damaging the Five Great Divine Punishers’ reputation.

However, the other three Divine Punishers were convinced by Han Tuo and Yi Tian. Their combat talent was too terrifying and had long defeated them.

Han Tuo shook his head and laughed, but he did not say anything.

“So, you’re the Heavenly Sage’s son. Then, you’re family. May I know how Fellow Daoist Han became a Divine Punisher?” The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked with a smile. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Han Tuo didn’t hide anything and talked about his background over the years.

He and Yi Tian were both born and died. Becoming the Divine Punisher was open and aboveboard, so he was naturally not afraid to say it.

The other three Divine Punishers also had their own bumpy experiences, but they were not familiar with the Heavenly Dao and naturally would not share them.

For a time, only Han Tuo’s voice was left in the Universal Hall. The Sages listened to him.

The Hidden Sect Sages looked at him with pride.

Han Tuo was Han Jue’s son and would definitely inherit the Hidden Sect in the future. They would naturally be aggrieved if he was a good-for-nothing. Now, Han Tuo’s performance made them very satisfied and even pleasantly surprised.

Indeed, dragons gave birth to dragons and phoenixes gave birth to phoenixes.

The news quickly spread to the Hidden Sect.

The personal disciples in the second Dao Field also learned of this through the Myriad Worlds Projection.

They gathered together to discuss this matter.

Murong Qi sighed. “Grandmaster’s hands extend really far away. They landed on the Five Great Divine Punishers, and his son even became the leader.”

Great Loose Heaven’s eyes flickered. “Not necessarily. Perhaps this is also the leader of the Divine Spirits’ plan against Sect Master.”

Everyone thought about it and agreed.

Han Ming frowned. “It won’t be good if the Divine Spirits’ leader can control Han Tuo’s will.”

Guan Bubai shook his head and said, “How can Sect Master not know what you’re thinking? Since he knows, it means that he has absolute confidence.”

After reincarnating freely, Guan Bubai, who was born with an invincible heart, worshiped Han Jue the most. In his eyes, Han Jue completely matched the name of invincibility.

How could an invincible person be plotted against?

How could someone who could be plotted against be invincible?

At this moment, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial walked over and shouted, “Guan Bubai, enter the simulation trial and

fight.”

The Chaotic Fiendcelestials were naturally combative. The simulation trial had already become their greatest hobby. As the strongest among the Fiendcelestials, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial could only find Guan Bubai to fight because the other Fiendcelestials did not dare. Only Guan Bubai was headstrong.

Guan Bubai immediately stood up and said, “So be it. Today, I’ll remove your title as the strongest Fiendcelestial!”

The others who were chatting about Han Tuo looked at each other and found it funny.

Their worries vanished after being reminded by Guan Bubai.

That’s right.

Who could scheme against Han Jue?

Time passed quickly.

In the third Dao Field.

Han Jue opened his eyes.

It meant that after a hundred thousand years, his cultivation level had improved greatly again. He was getting closer and closer to breaking through.

.

He had wanted to break through in one go, but his heart softened when he thought of Han Qing’er.

He sent a voice transmission to her, asking her to enter the temple.

Bang!

The door of the Daoist temple was pushed open. Dressed in red, Han Qing’er blew in front of Han Jue like a fire wind.

“Father!” Han Qing’er shouted, her voice filled with grievance, resentment, and surprise.

She had waited too long for this day!

A hundred thousand years.

She was about to go mad.

Many times, she wanted to barge in forcefully, but she was stopped by Qingluan’er. In order to defeat Qingluan’er, she had no choice but to start cultivating. Qingluan’er also worked hard to cultivate to not be surpassed by her.

The mother and daughter fought for some time. Han Qing’er had already become a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, while Qingluan’er was at the perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
