Chapter 819 Breakthrough! Perfection!

After arranging Han Zuitian’s matter, Han Jue sent a dream to Divine Lord Peacock and entered it as the Dark Forbidden Lord.

Divine Lord Peacock opened his eyes and immediately bowed when he saw him.

Han Jue said, “I have a mission for you.”

Divine Lord Peacock perked up. Something had happened!

His hands were itchy!

Previously, he did not win when dealing with the Sacred True Martial Buddha. It made him lose face, but he did not dare to really ask the Dark Forbidden Lord for help.

“Go ahead! I can do anything for you!”

Divine Lord Peacock said proudly as if he had forgotten that he still had to rely on the Dark Forbidden Lord to save him.

Han Jue said, “Attain the Dao!”

Divine Lord Peacock was stunned.

Han Jue said, “Your cultivation is too weak. It’s not easy to hand you missions.”

Divine Lord Peacock was embarrassed and did not dare to refute.

......

Although there were very few Great Dao Sages, from the perspective of the Dark Forbidden Lord, the Freedom Sages were indeed insufficient.

were

“Alright!”

Divine Lord Peacock agreed.

Han Jue said, “Don’t wander around for the time being. Cultivate well. There’s something important waiting for you to do after attaining the Great Dao.”

Divine Lord Peacock nodded, feeling even more awkward.

It seemed that the Dark Forbidden Lord already knew that he had attacked the Buddhist World.

Sigh.

He had embarrassed himself again.

Divine Lord Peacock felt that if he lost again, his bragging would become a humiliation.

Han Jue didn’t say anything else and removed the dream. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Inside the Daoist temple.

Han Jue opened his eyes and sighed softly.

To be honest, he was indeed a little disappointed in Divine Lord Peacock.

This fellow seemed to be a little obsessed with his current power and forgot to work hard.

Han Jue opened the emails and checked his recent friends.

(Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan was attacked by a Primordial Heavenly Devil) x80020012

(Your grand-disciple Murong Qi has tempered his Combat Dao heart. His cultivation has increased greatly.]

(Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]

(Your enemy Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial was cursed by a mysterious curse.]

The Chaos began to stir again!

What was the Primordial Heavenly Devil?

Hopefully, it was not a Chaotic force. It was probably Dao Sovereign and the other three fighting in a closed world.

Further down, Han Jue saw a mysterious curse.

Someone actually dared to curse the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial.

Is he trying to cause trouble for me?

Han Jue was not angry. He was already used to it.

Almost every time he read the emails, someone would be cursed by a mysterious curse. Most of the time, it was Jing Tiangong and the other believers of the Dark Forbidden Lord causing trouble.

Strong people were everywhere.

Han Jue continued cultivating after reading the emails.

Next was to break through to the perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm!

He wouldn’t stop even if the sky collapsed!

In the mysterious void.

Jiang Jueshi sat in a group of meteors. He deduced with both hands. Purple wheels wrapped around his body. They were mysterious and profound as if they contained the true meaning of the Great Dao.

He had left the Heavenly Dao for some time. His cultivation had completely stabilized. At the same time, he had also experienced many battles. He was summarizing his experience and wanted to create a great Mystical Power.

Although the Great Reincarnation Creation Technique was strong, it was still a cultivation technique. He lacked his own combat Mystical Power.

Suddenly!

Jiang Jueshi suddenly opened his eyes.

“Fellow Daoist, why are you staring at me?” he asked in a low voice. A terrifying aura erupted, shaking the surrounding space. A mocking laugh sounded. “You are not simple, junior. Your Dao Fruit is clearly only at the early-stage Primordial Chaos Realm, but your Dharmic powers are already comparable to the perfected Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. Furthermore, you are less than 200,000 years old. Tsk tsk, I didn’t expect that other than the Heavenly Dao Divine Might Heavenly Sage, there would be another with such talent.”

Jiang Jueshi frowned.

A figure appeared.

It was Shi Dudao.

Shi Dudao was not the only one. Li Daokong and Ancestor Xitian also appeared.

Jiang Jueshi was moved and immediately bowed. “Ancestor!”

He had once heard Ancestor Xitian preach the Dao and could be considered to have received his favor.

Ancestor Xitian was deep in thought.

He carefully recalled Jiang Jieshi and quickly remembered that it was only because his cultivation level was outstanding that he could not remember if it was a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. This was because he had taught countless cultivators, and Jiang Jieshi had been mediocre in the past.

Li Daokong smiled and said, “You’re also from the Heavenly Dao? Tsk tsk, you weren’t asked by the Sages to stay despite your talent?”

Jiang Jueshi said calmly, “They can’t make me stay.”

How arrogant!

Shi Dudao smiled. “Let’s spar? Join us if you lose. If you win, we’ll leave immediately and not disturb you.”

Jiang Jueshi stared at him and suddenly said, “I remember you, Shi Dudao. You were once the strongest person below the Sages of the Immortal World.”

Shi Dudao smiled in satisfaction. “I didn’t expect you to have seen me before. It seems that you’re not as young as you look.”

He had left the Heavenly Dao for a long time. Jiang Jueshi should not have seen him. There was only one explanation. Jiang Jueshi was not a new soul, but a reincarnated mighty figure.

Jiang Jueshi replied, “Alright!”

Li Daokong glanced at Shi Dudao and said, “Don’t lose. This kid is not simple.”

Jiang Jueshi looked at him with a complicated expression.

He remembered Li Daokong.

He was the eldest disciple of the Human School. However, Li Daokong did not remember him.

The two of them were not disciples of the Human School of the same era, after all. However, Jiang Jueshi had been too mediocre in the Human School in the past and was not valued. Therefore, he paid a lot of attention to the eldest disciples. Li Muyi was considered his junior.

Jiang Jueshi had a deep impression of Li Daokong. This person’s talent was indeed impressive. He had once thought that Li Daokong was the number one prodigy since ancient times until the Divine Might Heavenly Sage appeared and made all the prodigies pale in comparison.

“I can’t lose!”

Shi Dudao snorted and flew towards him.

Ancestor Xitian stared at Jiang Jueshi in deep thought.

75,300 years later!

Han Jue finally had the chance to break through. He didn’t stop.

Two thousand years later, he successfully broke through!

Perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm!

His Dharmic powers surged!

The long-awaited feeling fascinated Han Jue.

What he enjoyed the most was the feeling of breaking through, surpassing all joy.

He checked his attributes panel as he consolidated his cultivation.

[Name: Han Jue]

(Lifespan: 2,154,332 / 10,899,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,9 99,999]

[Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]

(Cultivation: Perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm (Perfect Sage)]

(Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]

[Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]

Three digits had appeared in front of his lifespan. Could this be considered a hundred times increase in lifespan?

It was even more exaggerated than before!

Han Jue suddenly regretted it.

Should he have squandered his lifespan before breaking through?

Forget it, he didn’t know who to curse. He should just cultivate obediently.

Don’t cause trouble!

Han Jue consolidated his cultivation with great satisfaction.

Three thousand years passed quickly.

Han Jue didn’t cultivate his Mystical Power immediately. Instead, he checked his emails to see if anything had happened in the Chaos recently.

Soon, he was attracted by two emails.

[Your good friend Shi Dudao was attacked by your good friend Jiang Jueshi and was severely injured.)

(Your good friend Jiang Jueshi was attacked by your good friend Ancestor Xitian and was severely injured.]
