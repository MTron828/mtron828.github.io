Chapter 1140 Space-Time Force, Undercurrents Surging

Passing through the black vortex, Han Yu arrived in the spatial turbulence. As the Great Dao Supreme, Han Yu was not confused by the spatial illusion and quickly tracked Han Liang’s figure.

Han Liang was hugged by a masked gray-robed man and could not break free.

The gray-robed man’s mask was clearly a Chaotic Supreme Treasure. Han Yu could not spy on his true appearance. Even his aura felt ethereal.

If he did not see it with his own eyes, he would probably think that Han Liang was traveling through the spatial turbulence alone.

Han Yu quickly approached. Han Liang’s eyes widened in surprise when he saw him.

The gray-robed man turned around and waved his sleeve. Endless blood wind drowned Han Yu, but he did not panic. He used a Divine Might Great Heaven Palm to disperse it and even severed this spatial turbulence.

Han Yu reached out and wrapped Han Liang with his Dharmic powers. He wanted to pull him over, but an extremely powerful force dispersed his Dharmic powers and even injured his soul.

Han Yu frowned and felt uneasy. With this exchange, he knew that he was not the other party’s match.

However, He did not retreat. He had to save Han Liang.

Han Liang was born with a bloodline suppression on the other clansmen. Such potential was the fortune of the Han family and could not be lost.

Han Yu attacked again.

The gray-robed man suddenly stopped and canceled out Han Yu’s Mystical Power. “Sage Han Yu, you shouldn’t have stopped me.”

Han Yu found his voice unfamiliar and asked in a low voice, “You want to be enemies with the Han family?”

The gray-robed man said, “On the contrary, I’m saving the Han family. This child can’t be left alive.”

Han Yu frowned.

The gray-robed man raised his right hand and drew a semicircle in front of him. In an

instant, a blood-colored half-moon condensed. Han Yu’s gaze subconsciously landed on the blood-colored half-moon and he was in a daze.

Han Yu opened his eyes and discovered that he had arrived in a blood-colored void. In the distance, he could see many dilapidated worlds. Corpses were everywhere.

This was a blank domain. The reason why it

was blood-colored was that there were too

many killings.

Han Yu saw a figure. It was Han Liang.

This Han Liang looked to be only twelve or thirteen years old. He wore a blood-patterned black robe. The crisscrossing blood patterns constantly emitted a blood mist. This black robe was slightly wide. His long hair was disheveled, and a cruel smile hung on his handsome face.

Han Yu was not shocked to see Han Liang. He

realized that this was an illusion. What he

saw and heard was not important. What he had to do was leave the illusion as soon as

possible.

When Han Liang rushed in front of him, he still did not care.

Boom-

Han Liang’s palm pierced through Han Yu’s chest. The extremely realistic pain moved Han

Yu.

Disbelief appeared on his face.

Han Liang was absorbing his Dharmic

powers!

This was not a fake illusion!

Impossible!

…

In the third Dao Field.

Han Jue opened his eyes. Han Yu and Han Yunjin were waiting to see him outside the Daoist temple.

Han Jue let them in.

Han Yunjin bowed and said anxiously,

“Father, my son Han Liang has been captured!”

Han Yu told him about his pursuit of the gray-robed man. He hid the future of Han Liang he had seen.

Han Jue was not surprised and said calmly, “I already know about this.”

Seeing Han Jue’s calm reaction, Han Yunjin

couldn’t help but ask, “Father, what should we do about this?”

Han Yunjin had countless children, so he naturally did not show preference to Han Liang. At first, he was still very vigilant, so he

was more worried that Han Liang would become a hidden danger.

With that, a small head poked out from behind Han Jue. Who else could it be but Han

Liang? The Daoist temple blocked their senses, so

Han Yunjin and Han Yu didn’t sense Han Liang’s existence after entering. In front of Han Jue, they didn’t dare to look around.

“Liang’er!” Han Yunjin shouted in surprise. Han Yu also heaved a sigh of relief. Han Liang didn’t pounce on his father.

Instead, he lay on Han Jue’s shoulder and giggled at his father.

Seeing his smile, Han Yu could not help but

shiver.

Han Jue said, “Go back. Liang’er will stay here with me.”

Han Yunjin hesitated. Seeing that his youngest son did not want to go with him at all, he sighed and left.

Han Yu also wanted to say something, but he

suddenly felt relieved upon seeing Han Jue’s

gaze. Perhaps their progenitor, the strongest existence, knew everything.

Han Yu also left, but Han Yunjin did not leave

the Dao Field immediately. Instead, he went to visit his mother, Li Yao.

Han Jue hugged Han Liang and smiled. “Little

fellow, don’t run around in the future. Many people want to capture you, including yourself.”

Han Liang tilted his head and asked,

“Grandpa, why would I capture myself?”

Han Jue smiled and didn’t say anything. He rubbed his head.

In the Daoist temple next door.

Han Yunjin faced Li Yao and expressed his

worry.

The two of them sat facing each other. They

did not look like mother and son, but more like siblings.

Li Yao’s cold face revealed a smile. “Don’t

worry. Liang’er is by your father’s side now. This is your father’s concern for you.” Han Yunjin was stunned and came to a realization.

If even his father could not control Han

Liang, no one in the world would be able to protect him.

Li Yao continued, “You already have enough descendants. You don’t have to have children anymore.”

Han Yunjin blushed and hurriedly bid farewell.

Li Yao smiled and closed her eyes to continue cultivating.

Among Han Jue’s Dao Companions, she was

the one with the greatest hope of becoming a Dao Creator. She had also been working hard toward this goal and had never relaxed.

In the Dao Field.

Han Liang rode the clouds. Sometimes, he transformed into a Kun Peng, sometimes into an Azure Dragon, causing the disciples on the

ground to exclaim and clap from time to time. These disciples’ cultivation levels far exceeded Han Liang’s. The reason why they were so

shocked was not only to please him but also because of Han Liang’s potential. This kid was already at the Deity Realm. He

had grown too quickly!

Han Liang had always looked like a youth and

his temperament would never grow up, so he was deeply loved by the disciples. “Liang’er, Third Aunt is here!”

Han Qing’er flew over and hugged him. Han Liang looked disgusted and struggled to get out of her grasp. “Go away. I don’t want to play with you!”

In the beginning, Han Liang quite liked Han

Qing’er, but every time she came, she would

trample on him, causing him to feel more and more disgusted.

No matter how Han Liang struggled, he could not escape Han Qing’er.

On the other side, Jiang Jueshi went to visit

Han Jue.

After Han Jue became invincible, he no longer deliberately entered seclusion. Furthermore, very few people dared to disturb him.

Jiang Jueshi kowtowed respectfully after entering the temple.

He looked up at Han Jue and said, “Master, discovered something in the cycle of reincarnation. A mysterious force is

I

accumulating power in space-time and even

mentioned the Dark Forbidden Lord. I’m

afraid it’s not a good thing.” He told Han Jue what he knew. He left after

Han Jue expressed his understanding. He only

came to remind him.

Han Jue looked at Han Liang.

“I didn’t expect you, Ji Xianshen, and Heavenly Venerate Xun to be together. How interesting,” Han Jue muttered to himself. Heavenly Venerate Xun was the future Dao Creator from the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. He was also Han Jue’s descendant. But that was not Han Liang. He was only related to him.
