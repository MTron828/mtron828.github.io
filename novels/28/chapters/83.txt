Chapter 84: Divine Beast Zhu Dou, Destroying the World

Northern Yan.

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

Demon King Dian Su opened his eyes and frowned.

Ever since he went to the Jade Pure Sect, his nightmare had come to an end. Therefore, he had made the best use of his time to recuperate until today.

But recently, he had been feeling uneasy.

This uneasiness came out of nowhere. Even his demonic blood stirred.

“What’s going on? Is that Immortal trying to harm me again?”

The more he thought about it, the more miserable he felt.

After being sealed for two thousand years, he had been heavily injured before he could even take revenge. Demon King Dian Su felt that his subordinates were laughing at him.

The more he thought about it, the more frustrated he became. An evil fire burned in his heart.

He really wanted to slaughter the entire Great Yan!

Forget it!

He had to endure it.

Demon King Dian Su sighed and closed his eyes to continue cultivating.

…

Above the sea of clouds was a huge mirror-like lake. Surrounded by clouds, it was as beautiful as a painting.

Xuan Qingjun and a purple-robed woman sat by the lake. The purple-robed woman was the mighty figure who had saved Zhou Fan.

“Senior Sister, aren’t you ascending?” The purple-robed woman turned her head and asked.

Xuan Qingjun didn’t open her eyes as she replied, “It’s not time yet.”

The purple-robed woman clicked her tongue in wonder. “I really don’t understand all of you. You could’ve ascended at the Tribulation Transcendence Realm. Even now that you’ve reached the Mahayana Realm and have completely elevated your body, you can already do well in the Immortal Realm. What are you waiting for?”

Xuan Qingjun didn’t reply but asked instead, “How is Zhou Fan?”

“Don’t mention it. Compared to his previous life, this kid is like a completely different person. He’s extremely impatient and might even need me to save him one day. However, he already completely trusts me.”

“Yes, this child is an important part of our plan. Don’t let him die, and don’t let him resist you.”

“He won’t. This child lacked love since he was young. If you treat him well, he will be loyal.”

“Speaking of which, I have a Dao companion in the Jade Pure Sect.”

“Ah? Senior Sister, you actually found a partner!”

The purple-robed woman’s eyes widened. She immediately became interested and kept asking about him.

Xuan Qingjun recalled the past and smiled. “I wanted to see the sect Zhou Fan was from. I didn’t expect to meet a kid that I liked. This kid is an ascetic. After so many years, he might have reached the Soul Formation realm.”

The purple-robed woman said in surprise, “His potential isn’t inferior to Zhou Fan’s?”

“Of course. I’ll bring you to see him next time.”

Xuan Qingjun smiled when she mentioned Han Jue.

Even after walking around the world, she found that Han Jue was still the most handsome man she had ever seen. His personality was also very likable.

At this moment!

The surface of the mirror quickly turned fiery red. The wind howled, and heat waves scattered the sea of clouds.

Xuan Qingjun and the purple-robed woman immediately stood up. They looked down and saw a huge firebird with a wingspan of a thousand feet flying past.

The purple-robed woman asked in astonishment, “Divine Beast Zhu Dou? The legendary divine beast that represents calamity!”

Xuan Qingjun frowned. “This Zhu Dou isn’t mature yet, but it’s already filled with the aura of misfortune. Something must be attracting it.”

“Tsk tsk, I wonder which place is so unlucky to attract the Zhu Dou.”

…

Ever since he discovered that the Fusang Tree would shake every night, Han Jue began to feel uneasy.

He felt that the tree would attract something.

Could it be the legendary Golden Crow?

Impossible!

Isn’t the Golden Crow hanging in the sky?

He didn’t see the sun getting lower!

Han Jue paid attention. He didn’t dare to focus on his cultivation.

Several days later, Li Qingzi came to visit.

After entering the cave abode, he sat on a chair and said with a smile, “Elder Han, recently, the Jade Pure Sect has welcomed a joyous occasion. We discovered the ruins of an ancient sect with many resources inside. There are cultivation techniques, treasures, and even Dharma treasures. Do you want to take a look?”

Han Jue frowned and asked, “Has this matter spread?”

If such an opportunity were to spread, it would definitely attract all the cultivators in the world.

“Of course not. This is a secret of the sect. Elder Guan has already brought five elders and a hundred core disciples to guard it. The teleportation formation is about to be set up. When the time comes, the disciples of the Jade Pure Sect can directly enter the ruins.”

Li Qingzi smiled proudly.

Over the past few years, the Jade Pure Sect had been steadily developing. They did not provoke any enemies, and more and more itinerant cultivators joined the sect.

Most of the cultivators in the cultivation world had forgotten about the Deity Slaying Elder, but the upper echelons of the various sects still remembered him. Therefore, they didn’t dare to provoke the Jade Pure Sect or even stop its development.

Han Jue nodded and said, “That’s good. I won’t go. Be careful. Usually, this kind of ruins might have restrictions.”

“I understand. If I find any treasure that can increase Spirit Qi, I’ll get someone to send it over.”

“Thank you, Sect Master. You’re welcome.”

The two of them chatted briefly before Li Qingzi left in a hurry.

Han Jue’s mood improved.

He was very satisfied with the peaceful strengthening of the Jade Pure Sect. The stronger the sect was, the more he could cultivate in seclusion in peace.

Han Jue suddenly realized that Xun Chang’an was gone.

He immediately used his divine sense to track him and discovered that he was in an inn in the inner sect city.

Eh?

…

In the northern part of Great Yan, flames appeared in the sky, illuminating it.

The ice and snow on the ground melted at a speed visible to the naked eye. Countless demons escaped from their cave abodes and looked towards the horizon, including Demon King Dian Su.

As Dian Su stood at the entrance and looked at the sky, the light from the fire illuminated his face. He was shocked.

“That’s… Zhu Dou! How is that possible!”

“Oh no!”

Almost scared out of his wits, Dian Su immediately entered the cave abode. Mud rose from the cave entrance and quickly formed a mountain wall.

The divine beast Zhu Dou spread its wings and flew over. It was like the legendary Golden Crow sweeping across the land.

Wherever it passed, the ice melted, turning into a lake before evaporating into smoke.

Zhu Dou was shaped like a firebird. It had a head like a dog and three legs. Its claws were different from that of a ferocious bird and more like dragon claws. The overall appearance made it look extremely powerful and unstoppable.

The thousands of miles of snow melted under its heat!

Its eyes glowed like torches as it looked in the direction of the Jade Pure Sect! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

…

Jade Pure Sect, Inner Sect Inn.

In the guest room, Xun Chang’an sat at the table with a wine cup in his hand. He smiled and said, “Qian’er, how do you feel about coming to the Jade Pure Sect? I’ve already joined the sect for decades. If you encounter any trouble, you can look for me anytime.”

He looked at a graceful woman by the window.

She was dressed in green. Her long hair reached her waist and her skin was fair and beautiful. Although she was not so beautiful that she could cause the downfall of a city, she was still a rare beauty.

The woman called Qian’er tucked her hair behind her ear and said, “Chang’an, you don’t have to treat me like this. It’s really impossible between us. Perhaps you’re doing well in the Jade Pure Sect, but I can’t give myself to you for the sake of benefits.”

Xun Chang’an’s heart ached when he heard this. He gritted his teeth and said, “Why? Because of my looks? I can put on a handsome face.”

Qian’er turned around and looked at him. Her beautiful eyes were filled with dissatisfaction as she said, “What is real is real. What is fake will always be fake. If I love you, even if the seas run dry and the stones crumble, my heart will never change. If I don’t love you, even if the world is destroyed and only you and I are left, I will never fall in love with you.”

Heartache!

Xun Chang’an crushed the cup in his hand. His palm did not bleed, but his heart did.

At this moment!

The light of the fire shone on Qian’er’s back, and a hot wind blew in. Xun Chang’an’s eyes widened.

Qian’er subconsciously turned around and saw that the sky was quickly dyed red. A sun was speeding over from the horizon.

Divine Beast Zhu Dou!
