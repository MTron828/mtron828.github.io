Chapter 213 Heavenly Court’s Plan, Captured Good Brother

“After having a name, there must be rules. Hidden Sect disciples are not to cause trouble or bully the innocent.

“Of course, if anyone bullies a disciple of the Hidden Sect, as fellow disciples, you must retaliate.

“When you take in disciples in the future, don’t make abrupt decisions. Every new disciple has to be accepted by me.

“Most importantly, you are not allowed to kill your fellow disciples!”

Han Jue said seriously. There were not many rules in the sect. After all, there were not many disciples.

The disciples promised that they would remember this.

Han Jue stood up and waved his right hand, bringing Long Hao to the void above the Scarlet Cloud World.

This was the first time Long Hao came to the void. He was brought here by Di Taibai when he was young, but he didn’t see the void along the way.

He was shocked and nervous.

“Master, why did you bring me here?” Long Hao asked.

He thought that he had said something wrong and angered Han Jue. Han Jue said, “I want to see your current strength.”

Boom

Han Jue directly unleashed the Reincarnation Sword Intent and suppressed him.

In an instant, Long Hao’s face turned pale and his body trembled.

Ever since he was born, this was the first time he felt like he was facing death.

An unprecedented fear enveloped his heart. At this moment, his mind went blank.

After ten breaths of time, Han Jue finally retracted his Reincarnation Sword Intent.

Han Jue said expressionlessly, “Do you understand?”

Long Hao was stunned and sweating profusely. He carefully asked, “Understand what?”

Han Jue said, “There’s always someone stronger than you. After staying on the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain for so long, do you feel that you’re already very powerful?

“Little do you know that the world outside is even more dangerous than you think. “Your senior and junior disciples are mortals, but they’ve been cultivating diligently. Do you think you’ve really left them behind? You’re the son of the Heavenly Emperor. You should be far ahead of them, but you aren’t. “The Heavenly Emperor is not the strongest, either. Why did he send you here? It’s because this place is safe. If you were in the Heavenly Court, you would have died long ago. There has been internal strife there. They have many enemies. If you go to the Immortal World, you might die at any time.”

Han Jue’s words were like sharp blades piercing into Long Hao’s heart.

He was really afraid.

He also realized that he was too arrogant.

Before today, he had always felt that he was already very strong. His divine sense covered the mortal world. Other than Han Jue, no one could compare to him. In such an environment, he would inevitably be arrogant. Han Jue continued, “Hao’er, I don’t expect you to do anything for the Hidden Sect. I don’t need it, either. We share a master-disciple relationship and I watched you grow up. I naturally hope that you can live well forever.”

[Long Hao’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 5 stars]

Long Hao’s eyes were red. His heart was filled with excitement and guilt.

He clenched his fists and said, “Master, I was wrong.”

Han Jue smiled and said, “You’re my disciple. You have also grown up. Don’t always bully juniors in the future. You have to be an example, understand?”

Long Hao nodded.

Then, Han Jue brought him back to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.

After this day, Long Hao changed. He was no longer as outspoken, but he didn’t lose his confidence. He only became more restrained and no longer bullied Murong Qi, Zhou Mingyue, and Chu Shiren.

Long Hao cultivated diligently, which really stimulated the others.

After all, Long Hao had the greatest background. If he cultivated diligently, who could catch up?

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

Dao Comprehension Sword couldn’t help but ask, “Did you scare Hao’er?”

She had watched Long Hao grow up, so she was naturally concerned.

“What are you saying? Why would I scare him? I’m educating him!” Han Jue said angrily.

Dao Comprehension Sword curled her lips, thinking, Come on! You used to scare me like this!

She could only hold it in and not say it out loud.

Numinous Palace.

The Heavenly Emperor sat at the bottom and looked at the mirror floating in the hall with a satisfied smile.

Di Taibai smiled and said, “Your Majesty, this Han Jue is quite capable in educating his disciples. His Little Highness has also taken in some of his temperament.”

The Heavenly Emperor said, “How old is this brat? He’s already after my throne.” Di Taibai’s expression changed slightly. “Your Majesty, Little Highness didn’t say it on purpose. He doesn’t know what the Heavenly Emperor entails. He only thinks that you are powerful,” Di Taibai explained with a smile.

The position of the crown prince of the Heavenly Court wasn’t so simple. The position of the Heavenly Emperor was never based on an inheritance system.

Moreover, there were so many sons. If news of this spread, how many siblings would he offend?

“Have you investigated the disciples of the Heavenly Court?” The Heavenly Emperor asked.

Di Taibai nodded and said, “It’s already recorded.” “Where’s the Divine General? Have his injuries recovered?”

“He’s recovered. He’s cultivating at the Four Extreme Emperors’ place. The four Emperors are very satisfied with him. The Divine General might learn a Mystical Power from them.”

“Let him cultivate. It will also give the other Heavenly Generals a chance.” “Then, what should we do next?”

“I want to go to Kunlun personally.”

Di Taibai frowned and asked hesitantly, “If we go to Kunlun at this time…”

The Heavenly Emperor snorted. “All along, it has been others who found trouble with the Heavenly Court. I’ve already had enough. The Heavenly Court has to display the temperament of the lord of all worlds!” Di Taibai had a headache, but he did not dare to refute.

He understood one thing.

The peace of the Immortal World was about to be stirred!

…

Twenty years later. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Han Jue was still a distance away from the perfected Reincarnation Mystic Immortal Realm.

It wasn’t that easy to become a Golden Immortal.

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the enemies while checking his emails.

(Your grand-disciple Fang Liang was attacked by an Immortal God) x2 [Your grand-disciple Fang Liang gained an epiphany beside the Heavenly River and his cultivation increased greatly.]

(Your good friend Huang Jihao was attacked by demons] x1987

[Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck. The Dragon Immortal Island encountered a Heavenly Tribulation that was hard to come by in tens of thousands of years. More than half of them died.]

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by the True Dragon Race) x10228

(Your good friend Zhang Guxing was attacked by a Divine Palace Immortal Emperor and was severely injured.]

Han Jue suddenly frowned.

He noticed that Zhang Guxing was severely injured and was even harmed by a Divine Palace Immortal Emperor. What happened? Han Jue immediately comprehended the Sword Dao and quickly entered the Sword Dao River.

However, he didn’t see Zhang Guxing.

Han Jue had a bad feeling.

Did something happen to him?

“You’re finally here.”

A voice entered Han Jue’s ears, startling him so much that he turned to look in its direction.

A figure stood not far away, staring at him.

“Zhang Guxing asked me to tell you something,” the figure continued.

Han Jue asked in surprise, “What happened to my good brother?”

The figure replied, “He was taken away by the Divine Palace and won’t return here anymore.

“From now on, you will guard the Sword Dao River. I will pass the divine seal to you.”

Han Jue asked in a low voice, “Is he alright?”

The shadow sighed. “His enemy took up a higher position and imprisoned him. Back to the topic, he asked me to tell you this: ‘Perhaps you’re right. I hope you can follow your Dao heart.”” Follow his Dao Heart?

Keep hiding?

Han Jue’s heart sank.

He was about to speak when the shadow suddenly raised his hand. Then, a beam of light shot out from his index finger and hit him.
