Chapter 1164 Primordial Fusion

In the vast purple starry sky.

Countless Primordial Purple Qi filled the air. This was the Primordial Origin.

The three Primordial Chaos were called Desolate Primordial Chaos, Primordial Origin, and Life Primordial Chaos.

They were all named after their own creators’ names or creations.

Primordial Origin stood in the Primordial Void as his main body. Endless purple Qi coiled around his body, causing his majestic figure to look extremely terrifying.

Primordial Origin opened his eyes and then opened his right hand. A person appeared in his palm. It was Chen Jue.

Chen Jue was sealed. His body was curled up and his will did not awaken.

Primordial Origin frowned and looked down at him. He muttered, “Strange, what’s hidden in your body? Even I can’t steal this creation.”

He had targeted Chen Jue. On the battlefield, Chen Jue’s strength left a deep impression on him. Later, he discovered that Chen Jue’s strength was not only because of his potential but because of a fortuitous encounter. Therefore, he tried his best to capture him.

However, he couldn’t seize this opportunity. He stared at Chen Jue, his eyes emitting a strange light as if he wanted to see through his soul.

After a long while…

Primordial Origin trembled.

He retracted his hand. Chen Jue floated in the void, his body emitting a dazzling fire light.

The defensive power of creation!

Primordial Origin was even more curious. What kind of fortuitous encounter was this? It could actually devour his power. One had to know that he was about to condense the first Supreme Rule. Only less than five existences were stronger than him in the entire Endless Era.

Could it be a Dao Creator?

Impossible!

There was no such creation in Formless World.

Perhaps it was a new product of the Endless Era.

Primordial Origin also discovered that the Endless Era was not only the expansion of the world but also something completely different from the past.

He adjusted his state of mind and stopped trying to snatch Chen Jue’s creation.

He would see when he condensed the first Supreme Rule.

Primordial Origin seemed to sense something at this moment. He waved his hand and Chen Jue disappeared.

A figure tore through the void and arrived.

It was Huang Zuntian.

Primordial Origin asked, “Why are you here?”

Huang Zuntian said, “It’s not only me.”

With that, the void tore apart again and the

majestic Han Huang walked out.

Primordial Origin’s expression became subtle as he saw him.

Chen Jue had the Han family’s bloodline. He could deduce this.

However, the Han family had countless and even more outstanding descendants. Chen Jue did not have much interaction with the Han Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

family.

“What is it?” Primordial Origin asked calmly.

Han Huang said, “I asked him to come. Although we work separately, we’re both Primordial Fiendcelestials. I have an idea.”

Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian looked at him, waiting for him to continue. “The Endless Era is so big. Be it me or you,

it’s impossible for one of us to dominate the Endless Era. More and more Dao Creators will appear in the future. I feel that the three Primordial Chaos can be fused. From now on, we will live and die together. If more Primordial Fiendcelestials are born in the

future, they will have to rely on us,” Han Huang said calmly, causing Primordial Origin

to frown.

Primordial Origin looked at Huang Zuntian. His expression did not change. Clearly, he had already learned of this and had come with

Han Huang to persuade him.

Primordial Origin pondered.

The benefit of fusing was that they would join

forces from now on. At least, they could rely on each other. The downside was that they would not be able to separate in the future. Of course, all of this had to be based on Han Huang’s sincere desire to cooperate. With Primordial Origin’s understanding of him, this kid was only domineering, but he

was not that scheming.

Most importantly, it was the person behind Han Huang.

Primordial Origin asked, “Who will be the

master?”

Han Huang shook his head and laughed. “There’s no need to prioritize. Let our Primordial Chaos fuse and let karma and fate fuse. I can hand the Primordial Chaos to you

if you like power and know how to govern.”

Huang Zuntian smiled. “I want to cultivate.” Primordial Origin smiled. “In that case, I have no objections. How can we fuse the Primordial Chaos?”

Han Huang began to describe his idea. Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian felt that

it was feasible, but this method was needed.

Before leaving, Primordial Origin handed Chen Jue over and wanted to ask Han Huang about his attitude.

Han Huang said indifferently, “It’s common

for two forces to fight and be captured as long as you don’t implicate the innocent.” Primordial Origin smiled. “Since you’re so sincere, I’ll let him go. This child has a mysterious creation. His future achievements are immeasurable.”

“Such a descendant is nothing in the Han

family.”

Han Huang disappeared after saying that.

Huang Zuntian added, “This child is my disciple’s brother. You’re holding the line that connects two people.”

Primordial Origin threw Chen Jue to him and

smiled. “In that case, I’ll give you the favor.”

“I won’t thank you.”

Huang Zuntian took Chen Jue and left the Primordial Chaos.

Primordial Origin smiled and closed his eyes

to cultivate.

Under the blue sky and white clouds, in the high-wall courtyard.

A handsome man was practicing martial arts.

Han Jue sat on the steps in front of the hall

and yawned.

The handsome man stopped and came in

front of him. He chuckled and said, “Grandpa, how’s my fist technique just now?” Han Jue curled his lips. “What a waste of

talent. Cultivate. There’s no future in practicing martial arts.”

The handsome man’s name was Ru Daolong.

He had awakened an Innate Great Creation, Superstar.

The Superstar was born with great opportunities. He would surpass his limits

every time he was on the verge of death. If he

survived, his potential would become even stronger. In other words, the Superstar needed to constantly encounter desperate situations. It was very easy for him to die young if he did not have a backing. The trend of martial arts was prevalent in this

immortal world, not cultivation. There were no legends of cultivators here, but Han Jue

knew that those legendary terrifying martial artists were cultivators.

He had found Ru Daolong seven years ago.

The two of them were master and disciple,

but Ru Daolong had yet to truly develop the potential of the Superstar.

Ru Daolong curled his lips. “What cultivation?

I’ve never heard of it.”

A group of servants rushed in at this moment. The thin man in the lead wailed, “Young Master, the neighboring village is bullying us again!”

Ru Daolong’s eyes widened like leopard eyes.

He said angrily, “They’re courting death! Let’s go!” Han Jue lay down and continued to bask in the sun as Ru Daolong left in a hurry. “Kid, this current life won’t last long.” Han Jue chuckled. No one heard him. He was talking to himself. It was his habit. Ru Daolong’s family background was considered big among mortals, but Han Jue saw two Immortal Emperors fighting. They were getting closer and closer to this world.

Their fight would affect this world sooner or

later. At that time, the end of the world would arrive. Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to remind Ru Daolong. He still had dozens of such descendants. He was just bored and came out to play with them.

Ru Daolong’s personality was truly a perfect

match for the Superstar Great Creation. With such a fiery temper, he would definitely encounter many desperate situations in the

future. However, he would definitely die if he did not have a backer.

There were also examples of descendants with Innate Great Creation dying, but the Innate Great Creation could reincarnate with their descendants.
