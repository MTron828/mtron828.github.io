Chapter 1092 Before the Immeasurable

Calamity

After knowing that his Dao attainment path was safe, Han Jue left a clone in the palace and his main body returned to the third Daoist temple.

Shan’e didn’t sense that he had left. The alternation between the clone and the main body was extremely fast. Even a perfected Great Dao Supreme like Shan’e couldn’t sense it.

Han Jue had twenty-five Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempts now. He hesitated to use them.

He gave up after thinking about it.

He would use it when the Endless Era arrived. At that time, dozens of Creation Heaven’s Chosen would gather together and be nurtured by him. Then, he would let them out to make a name for themselves. It would be simply

awesome.

They had to cultivate under the Divine Might Heavenly Sage if they wanted to become a Dao Creator!

If such words spread, how impressive would that be?

Han Jue thought silently and looked forward to it.

Of course, it was just a thought. He would find it annoying if that really happened.

Han Jue wouldn’t deliberately suppress the juniors in the future, but it was best for the majority of his own people to be in the ranks of Dao Creators.

He could never lose his vigilance!

This was how the Ninth Chaos was

counterattacked.

The Ninth Chaos even had the intention to suppress it. Han Jue couldn’t let it go completely.

Han Jue began to check his emails to see how his friends had been all these years.

[Your son Han Huang created the Primordial Demon Soldier. His providence has declined.]

[Your disciple Ji Xianshen has comprehended the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. His cultivation has increased greatly.]

[Your good friend Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was attacked by your good friend Ninth Chaos.]

[Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has received guidance from your good friend Formless Transcendent Deity. His cultivation has increased greatly.]

[Your good friend Huang Zuntian’s soul has transformed into a Primordial Soul. His

providence has transformed.]

[Your disciple Jiang Jueshi has entered Chaotic

Reincarnation.]

[Your son Han Huang was cursed by a ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

mysterious curse.]

[Your descendant Han Ye was attacked by a

mysterious mighty figure and was severely

injured.]

[Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck and was

expelled by Shi Tian’s rules.]

Primordial Demon Soldier?

What a show!

He probably wanted to nurture a force and stir

up the entire Chaos.

Han Jue was a little disdainful.

He continued reading. He frowned at Su Qi’s

encounter.

Shi Tian’s rules could still expel people. It was clearly Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s intention. However, he didn’t dare to fall out with Han Jue, so he didn’t kill him.

In that case, Han Jue couldn’t be bothered. It was good that Su Qi was wandering around.

It could pave the way for Han Huang. The more chaotic the Chaos was, the more dangerous the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity would be. The chances of Han Huang surviving also increased. Su Qi was equivalent to Han Huang’s helper.

Han Jue suddenly had an idea.

Should he tell the other disciples to help Han

Huang and share the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity’s creation?

Many sides were fighting Han Huang. It was very difficult to obtain a Great Creation, but it was different.

Han Jue thought for a moment and felt that it was troublesome. He would let nature take its

course.

After reading the emails, Han Jue stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple to visit his Dao Companions. He spent thousands of years visiting them one by one.

Han Jue left Xing Hongxuan’s Daoist temple for

last. Xing Hongxuan looked worried when she

mentioned Han Huang. “He betrayed the Creation Emperor Court and even took in that demoness’s force. Will he take the wrong path?”

Han Jue didn’t hide anything and told her Han Huang’s difficulties and goals.

Xing Hongxuan was shocked and nervous upon

hearing that Han Huang was about to destroy the Chaos.

“Husband, this is the path to death.” Xing Hongxuan grabbed his hand and pitifully pleaded with him.

She knew that only Han Jue could convince her

son.

Han Jue smiled and said, “I support him.”

He then explained the perspective of the Chaos

and the Endless Era. Han Huang seemed to be doing evil, but he was actually doing an unprecedented great creation.

“It’s so dangerous. When the time comes, will

those transcendent existences above the Chaos attack him? Won’t that cause trouble for you?” Xing Hongxuan frowned.

Han Jue smiled. “I’m only telling you. Don’t

tell the others.”

“Hmm?”

“The existence who created the Chaos is no

longer my match, and there are only a few Dao Creators above the Great Dao. None of them is my match.”

This was the first time Han Jue forcefully postured, but it was not awkward. What he said

was the truth.

Xing Hongxuan widened her beautiful eyes and

asked, “You’re already invincible?” “That’s right!”

“Isn’t there always someone stronger? Are you

sure there are no realms above the Dao Creator

Realm?”

“No. The Dao Creator Realm has been the limit

ever since the Primordial Chaos was born.

There’s no stronger.”

“Waa—”

Xing Hongxuan was moved. Her body trembled

in shock.

She had always felt that Han Jue’s talent was unparalleled and she had always believed in him.

But what did invincibility mean?

She couldn’t even imagine it.

“Can you create living beings now?” “Aren’t the disciples outside the Dao Field?” “What about destroying the Chaos?”

“Is everything just a thought for you?”

“You’re undying and indestructible?” “I have already transformed into countless will Dharma Idols that are eternal.”

“Then, can you increase our cultivation level?”

“Yes, but just Great Dao Supreme Realm at the most. You must rely on yourself if you want to break through to the Dao Creator Realm. Therefore, it’s best to stabilize your Dao heart first.”

“Do you have a Great Dao World?”

“Of course.”

Xing Hongxuan kept asking questions. Han Jue replied patiently, feeling extremely refreshed.

His wife was the best. She understood his

needs. Ask, ask with all your might!

It was also very satisfying to show off!

After a long time, Xing Hongxuan excitedly pulled Han Jue along to cultivate. Han Jue only returned to his Daoist temple

after thousands of years. Next was to wait for the Great Dao

Immeasurable Calamity to arrive!

Han Huang created the Primordial Demon Soldiers. As the number of Primordial Demon Soldiers increased, the spies of the various factions lurking in the Primordial Chaos faction also discovered this matter. The various factions were alarmed and began accumulating their strength and even beginning to rope them

in.

As the strongest force in the Chaos, the news reached their ears at the Great Dao Divine Spirit

level.

The Ultimate God of Punishment was also alarmed and did not dare to act anymore. He gathered the Great Dao Divine Spirits together. “Han Huang wants to destroy the Chaos and

create the Primordial Chaos. This is the calamity!”

“The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity’s karma has arrived. We should be able to sense it. Perhaps he’s wrapped in this karma.” “So what? We have to stop it. We’ll die too if the Chaos is gone!”

“You have to know that other than the Great

Dao Supremes, even Great Dao Sages can’t survive in the blank domain.”

“I have to suppress the Primordial Chaos!”

The Great Dao Divine Spirits discussed. Even Han Tuo, Dao Sovereign, Murong Qi, and the

other Great Dao Divine Spirits of the Hidden Sect were moved.

Was Han Huang crazy?

Yi Tian grinned. “As expected of your second

brother. He defeated all the living beings in the Chaos and still wants to do something greater.” However, his smile was a little cold. The Chaos

also involved his personal benefits. The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “Han Huang has already grown up. What should we do even if we want to suppress him?” He could no longer protect Han Huang. This fellow’s ambitions were too obvious. He even had no intention of hiding it. Even those at the

Freedom Realm were spreading this matter. Laozi said, “The Chaos alone won’t do. We

better join forces with the other Great Dao World domains.”

Han Huang was undoubtedly powerful, just like

the Divine Might Heavenly Sage back then. However, he was stronger and more dangerous

than the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
