Chapter 123: Sixth Level Tribulation Transcendence Realm, Defending the Sword Dao for a Million Years

Han Jue imparted the Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique, Seven Illusionary Steps, Major Chiliocosm Thunderstorm, and Wind God Technique to Fang Liang and Murong Qi.

The two of them were indeed unparalleled geniuses. In just half a year, they had completely grasped them.

They were all at the Nascent Soul Realm. Now that they were going out, they could protect themselves.

“Fang Liang, go out and train. After you see through the mortal world, come back and cultivate diligently. You will definitely be able to comprehend the true meaning of Heaven and Earth.”

“Murong Qi, you can also participate in the missions of the sect in the future and no longer be restricted to this mountain.”

Han Jue put his hands behind his waist and said to the two with his back facing them.

Under the Fusang Tree, Xun Chang’an and Yang Tiandong couldn’t help but open their eyes.

Han Jue wanted Fang Liang to go out?

This was the first time Han Jue took the initiative to let someone go down the mountain.

Yang Tiandong’s eyes were filled with envy. He also knew that he couldn’t compare to Fang Liang.

Terrified, Fang Liang hurriedly asked, “Grandmaster… Why are you chasing me away?”

Murong Qi was secretly surprised, but on the surface, he was just like Fang Liang.

Fang Liang was cautious, but Murong Qi was not. He was even a little proud. There was a pride in his bones that Xun Chang’an could not erase no matter how he taught him.

In Murong Qi’s opinion, his talent was unparalleled. He should be famous throughout the world, not hidden on this ascetic mountain!

He was willing to stay because he felt that his cultivation was insufficient.

“Go out to train, but you can come back whenever you want to,” Han Jue replied.

Fang Liang was relieved.

Han Jue ignored them and returned to the cave abode.

Dao Comprehension Sword was still cultivating. She went to the Jade Pure Sacred Sect and soon found it boring, so she started cultivating again.

Han Jue sat on the bed and started to cultivate.

Although there was Dao Comprehension Sword in the cave abode, the two of them rarely talked. Most of the time, they were silent. This was what Han Jue liked.

Fang Liang stayed for seven days before leaving the mountain alone.

Xun Chang’an stood at the edge of the cliff and watched him leave with a worried expression.

Upon seeing him in such a state, the Black Hell Chicken was not affected. Instead, it sighed. “Sigh, is the Chaotic Heavenly Dog dead? Why isn’t it back yet?”

Yang Tiandong said helplessly, “It’s impossible for it to die. That fellow is very tough. Killing it is harder than ascending to the heavens.”

The Black Hell Chicken did not reply.

…

Eight years later.

Han Jue finally broke through to the sixth level of the Tribulation Transcendence Realm.

The first thing he did after breaking through was to use the simulation trial to fight against Xuan Qingjun, who was at the third level of the Mahayana Realm.

This time, Han Jue was not defeated.

After a few minutes, he finally killed her.

Han Jue was slightly dissatisfied. He even used the Grand Unity Mystical Power but still could not kill Xuan Qingjun instantly.

The Fiend Emperor also had this cultivation level. When he came, it would be troublesome if he couldn’t be instantly killed.

It seemed like it was time to strengthen his Mystical Power again!

The last time he strengthened it was when he was at the Body Integration Realm. Now, he should be able to take another step in the Sword Dao River.

Han Jue thought about it and decided to strengthen the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger.

This Mystical Power could kill enemies from afar. This way, Han Jue didn’t have to show himself.

Han Jue began to ponder and comprehend the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger.

Soon, he entered a state of Dao Enlightenment.

Two months later.

A natural phenomenon shocked the entire mortal world. However, the war between the righteous and demonic was ongoing, so both sides were worried that the enemy would be breaking through.

The one who caused this phenomenon was naturally Han Jue.

He came to the Sword Dao River again with much familiarity. This time was different from the past. He could control his consciousness to move forward and stop.

“I should be able to meet that person again, right?” Han Jue thought silently.

He stepped forward.

One figure after another was overtaken by him. He walked at a moderate pace, paying attention to the flashing images of the sword cultivators.

After a while, Han Jue saw a familiar figure ahead, waiting for him.

He immediately greeted, “Senior, long time no see. How are you?”

The other party grunted. “It hasn’t been long. You’re here again. I won’t stop you this time. Go and seek death if you wish.”

Han Jue came in front of him and cupped his fists with a smile. “Thank you for your help the last few times. May I know your name?”

The other party remained silent.

Han Jue continued, “I’ve already reached the Tribulation Transcendence Realm. I’ll ascend sooner or later. I still want to repay you in the future. With my current cultivation level, I might not catch your eye, but I’ll work hard.”

The other party had always been guarding the Sword Dao River. He was definitely not a passerby. He might even be a supreme expert in the Upper World.

There were already two enemies of Han Jue in the Upper World. He didn’t want to be alone and helpless.

The other party snorted. “Cut it out. I’m presiding over the Sword Dao River only because I want to protect the Sword Dao. The mortal world you are in is not simple. Apart from you, there was also a genius who came previously. Although he was not as capable as you, it won’t be difficult for him to become a Sword Immortal in the future.”

Han Jue raised his eyebrows and asked curiously, “What is that person’s name?”

“Of course I can’t say it, but there is a karmic connection between you and him.”

These words made Han Jue think of someone.

Huang Jihao!

He was born with the Innate Sword Heart and had already stepped into the Void Amalgamation Realm. He displayed the attitude of a prodigy!

Han Jue did not think further and continued forward.

As he stepped past the mysterious figure, he felt tremendous pressure.

He moved on.

Second step!

Third step!

The last time, he had stopped at the third step, unable to advance any further.

This time, Han Jue took another step forward.

Fourth step!

Fifth step! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The terrifying pressure made Han Jue frown.

He gritted his teeth.

One step further!

Boom—

Han Jue’s consciousness burst into blue flames, but his foot still landed steadily.

He knew that he couldn’t go any further.

After Grand Unity, he took six more steps forward, it was enough!

Han Jue didn’t retreat immediately. Instead, he slowly turned around under the terrifying pressure.

The mysterious figure praised, “Impressive. Your talent in the Sword Dao surpasses all the sword cultivators in the countless mortal worlds.”

[Zhang Guxing has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 1 star.]

Zhang Guxing?

Han Jue thought silently, then walked in front of him and said, “Thank you for your praise, senior. I won’t disturb your cultivation.”

Zhang Guxing nodded slightly as Han Jue dispersed his consciousness.

In an instant, the Sword Dao River shattered and Han Jue returned to the mortal world.

Boom—

The Six Paths spirit energy in his body suddenly erupted!

His cultivation level began to grow rapidly!

[Your Mystical Power, Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger, has grown greatly. It has been upgraded to a Grand Unity Mystical Power.]

[You have comprehended the Sword Dao, your cultivation has increased greatly.]

Han Jue immediately circulated his cultivation technique and started to follow the momentum.

Dao Comprehension Sword opened her eyes and looked at him in shock, but didn’t disturb him.

In order not to disturb the Jade Pure Sacred Sect, Han Jue activated the system barrier and sealed the cave abode.

Seven days later.

His cultivation level stopped increasing. Although he was still a distance away from the seventh level of the Tribulation Transcendence Realm, it was already better than several years of bitter cultivation.

Not bad!

Han Jue used his interpersonal relationships to look for Zhang Guxing’s information.

[Zhang Guxing: Mid-stage Grand Unity True Immortal Realm. Defended the Sword Dao for a million years. Due to your top-notch sword cultivation potential, he has a favorable impression of you. However, he still has great doubts about your temperament. If you deliberately strike up a conversation with him, you will attract his disgust. Current favorability: 1 star.]

Grand Unity True Immortal!

How amazing!

Han Jue saw the note at the bottom and couldn’t help but feel awkward.

Was this what an expert was like?

So cold and arrogant!

If Han Jue ignored him next time, would it increase the favorability?
