Chapter 825 A Hundred Thousand to Ten Thousand!

Refining 10.8 decillion stars required a long time. Han Jue couldn’t do it easily even if he was a Great Dao Sage.

It took time for every star to transform. All Han Jue could do was refine these 10.8 decillion stars at the same time.

The Great Dao of Extreme Origin resonated with him. Han Jue fell into an indescribable state. It was like joy and addiction, but also like a dream. He sank into it and consumed a lot of his will.

After a certain period of time.

Han Jue’s 10.8 decillion stars finally completed their first transformation. His consciousness woke up.

He discovered that his cultivation level had increased greatly!

The strengthening of the stars could actually increase his stagnant cultivation!

This was the right path!

Han Jue was excited. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He checked his attributes panel and discovered that more than forty thousand years had passed.

The increase in his cultivation level exceeded the effect of his previous seclusion of fifty thousand years, even surpassing the cultivation speed before his breakthrough.

Han Jue didn’t continue cultivating but checked his emails.

......

He couldn’t cultivate blindly. He had to look at the people around him to prevent anything from happening.

Soon, Han Jue frowned.

Something had indeed happened!

(Your son Han Tuo was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was deprived of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. His soul is suppressed at the bottom of the Chaos.]

(Your good friend Yi Tian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was deprived of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. His soul is suppressed at the bottom of the Chaos.]

Something had happened to the two of them again.

Unlike Dao Sovereign and the other two, this time, Yi Tian and Han Tuo were suppressed at the bottom of the Chaos.

What was the bottom of the Chaos?

Han Jue was puzzled.

The Chaos was not a single space. Multiple layers of space-time might not be superimposed. It could also be parallel or even extremely far away.

Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce. Indeed, he couldn’t deduce where the bottom of the Chaos was.

He thought for a moment and sent a dream to Han Tuo.

The dream was above the city wall.

Han Tuo slowly opened his eyes. He was stunned when he saw him.

The father and son faced each other and fell silent.

Han Tuo said, “Father, I’m fine. You don’t have to worry.”

Han Jue snorted. “Why didn’t you summon

me?”

Han Tuo said, “I need to deal with the trouble I caused myself. Besides, I’m not dead yet, right? Furthermore, Yi Tian is accompanying me.”

Han Jue was speechless.

He still had the cheek to say that he had Yi Tian accompanying him.

“Really. I’m at the bottom of the Chaos now. I discovered a way to become stronger here. I would have died long ago if the person who suppressed me wanted to kill me. Perhaps this is a fortuitous encounter,” Han Tuo said seriously.

Han Jue felt that it made sense. Han Tuo had been suppressed for more than twenty thousand years. This already meant that it was not a hopeless situation.

“Alright,” Han Jue said helplessly.

He had saved Han Tuo more than once. This fellow did not develop dependence and instead avoided him.

It was not only Han Tuo. His disciples were the same.

Han Tuo said, “Father, don’t worry. I can definitely protect myself.”

Han Jue snorted and shook his head. He removed the dream.

In reality, Han Jue opened his eyes.

“This kid, when will he consider my feelings? He’s always in danger and feels that he doesn’t need to rely on me. Won’t I be worried?” Han Jue muttered to himself. He suddenly understood what parents were.

He looked at the Heavenly Dao.

Qin Ling had yet to become a Pseudo-Sage, but the Immeasurable Calamity had already begun. Many suppressed cultivators began to appear one after another. Almost all the providence sects had enemies.

One side of the conflict would definitely suffer in order to carry out absolute peace. As time passed, this would become a grudge.

Things would be fine if the providence sects were far stronger than all living beings. All living beings could only continue to endure.

However, the Heavenly Dao could lead to the Chaos now. More and more cultivators had freedom and obtained great cultivation. Their mentality was naturally arrogant. The ones who enforced the peaceful rules were the providence sects, so they naturally became the center of the calamity.

It was still alright overall. It was far inferior compared to the previous calamities. It was even inferior to the Immortal World before the previous calamity began.

“The Heavenly Dao still has to constantly become stronger. Only by becoming strong enough can it allow all living beings in the Heavenly Dao to live better.”

Han Jue thought silently.

The Heavenly Dao was strong enough. An endless stream of resources was transferred from the Chaos. Only by transferring the conflict to the Chaos could true peace be achieved, not the current peace that hid grudges.

Han Jue looked around and didn’t find any more geniuses like Jiang Jueshi. He felt a little regretful.

Gathering geniuses was also a form of entertainment.

It would be wonderful when they grew up and dominated their own regions.

Several days later, Han Jue continued to refine the stars.

The Heavenly Dao surged. Cultivators floated in time, while mighty figures wandered outside.

Most of the Sages were usually busy cultivating. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du began to give up his authority and let the new Sages become active.

Gradually, the Sages of the older generation were not as famous as the new ones. Just like before the Heavenly Dao restarted, Qiu Xilai was more famous than Ancestor Xitian.

The Hidden Sect’s development was also smooth. With the help of Han Jue’s clone, some disciples entered and some left.

Li Xuan’ao and Han Zuitian became the greatest leaders of the sect. One faced the outside world, while the other faced the inside.

Already hundreds of millions of disciples were under him, and this was even when some disciples left the Hidden Sect.

Li Xuan’ao maintained Han Jue’s philosophy. The Hidden Sect had always kept a low profile, but they were related to all the sects and had the favor of a Sage. Cultivators with some experience knew that the Hidden Sect was the number one sect in the Heavenly Dao!

However, the Hidden Sect did not cultivate providence. The disciples lacked the providence of the sect.

After a certain period of time.

Han Jue woke up again. The 10.8 decillion stars transformed again and his cultivation increased greatly. He checked his attributes panel and discovered that more than 87,000 years had passed.

Time passed quickly.

Han Jue started the simulation trial.

He wanted to test his cultivation results!

It was still five thousand Foolish Sword Sages!

He fought with all his might and easily suppressed them.

In the second simulation trial, he increased the number of Foolish Sword Sages to seven thousand.

He could barely fight!

He could win with enough time!

Han Jue challenged ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages next.

It was very difficult, but he could fight!

Han Jue opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief after dozens of simulation trials.

“No, it’s not enough. The Divine Authority Generals are definitely stronger than the Foolish Sword Sage. I might not be able to defeat them even if I defeat ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages. I have to have the strength to insta-kill a hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages before I can face them!”

Han Jue’s eyes became firm.

He tried and challenged twenty thousand Foolish Sword Sages alone!

Then…

Han Jue opened his eyes and shivered.

Too terrifying

Han Jue decided to attain the Great Dao Supreme Realm first!

He continued to refine the stars.

At this moment…

[Foolish Sword Sage sent you a dream. Do you accept?]

Han Jue wanted to vomit upon seeing the words “Foolish Sword Sage”.

Perhaps he was the one who knew the Foolish Sword Sage the best in the world.

Han Jue still chose to accept it after hesitating for a moment.

He could go over and copy Foolish Sword Sage’s latest strength if he could build a good relationship with him.
