Chapter 261 Chaos in the Buddhist Sect, Mysterious Mastermind

Ten days later.

The weakened Undying Emperor was cursed to death by Han Jue.

(Because of your curse, the remnant soul of your enemy Undying Emperor dissipated. His body and soul were destroyed.)

His profile picture in interpersonal relationships was also gone. Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

After cursing four enemies, he lost 100,000 years of life. Who could withstand this expenditure?

Han Jue’s heart ached, but he still had to continue cursing.

Next was the Dragon Subduing Buddha.

Grand Unity Golden Immortal cultivation level, four-star Hatred Points. He had to die!

Half a month later.

(Because of your curse, your enemy Dragon Subduing Buddha’s Buddhist heart shattered and he suffered from Qi Deviation. Fortunately, the Buddha Ancestor protected his soul.]

Damn it!

Another big shot was interfering!

Han Jue gritted his teeth and persisted.

Fortunately, this Buddha Ancestor was not as determined as the Demon Emperor.

Another ten days passed. (Because of your curse, your enemy Dragon Subduing Buddha turned into an evil fiend. The Buddhist and Devil energy clashed and he perished. His body and soul are destroyed.]

Another enemy icon was gone!

Han Jue felt very happy.

He looked at the remaining enemies. Most of them were immortals of the Heavenly Court, so their hatred was not high.

He was a little hesitant. If they were all cursed to death, wouldn’t Heavenly Court suffer heavy losses?

Forget it.

It was fine if the Hatred Points were one or two stars. The other party just did not like him and might not want to kill him. However, three stars of hatred meant that they had to be cursed to death. This was the sign of unforgiving hatred.

Han Jue filtered through the list and continued cursing

In any case, these immortals were not strong. It was fine if a few died.

It was all the hatred accumulated from resisting the Heavenly Troops more than a thousand years ago. After so many years, most of the hatred had decreased, but a few still maintained it. They were simply crazy.

Immortal World, Buddhist Sect.

The Heavenly Dao Buddha sat on a golden lotus. In front of him were countless Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Arhats.

Even though the Buddhist light shone brightly, the atmosphere was extremely oppressive.

Heavenly Dao Buddha slowly said, “After the fall of the Victorious Fighting Buddha, the Heavenly Rage Buddha and the Dragon Subduing Buddha also perished in the Buddhist Sect. I’ve deduced that someone is using a Supreme Treasure to curse. What do you think?”

Two Immortal Emperors and a Grand Unity Golden Immortal!

They were gone just like that! To the Buddhists, it was definitely a huge loss!

A fat Buddha said, “Someone is provoking the Buddhist Sect and even starting a war. This cannot be tolerated!” With that said, all the Buddhas were infuriated.

“Amitabha. Buddha is merciful. We don’t provoke others, but they provoke us!”

“How despicable. This is a complete slap to the face of the entire Buddhist Sect!”

“Could it be the Heavenly Court?”

“No, the Heavenly Emperor won’t do that. If he really wants to target us, I’m afraid the Heavenly Troops would have already come.” “I think it’s the Divine Palace. They’re mysterious and unfathomable. We don’t know how many mighty figures are hidden there. At least, no one in the Heavenly Court has such a powerful curse ability.” The Buddhas discussed. The Bodhisattvas, Arhats, and the envoys looked at each other and whispered.

The Heavenly Dao Buddha slowly opened his eyes and said, “I’ve deduced that the Dharma treasure is a book.”

A book?

The Buddhas were even more puzzled.

“This range is too large. There are too many treasures in the world in the form of books as Dharma treasures. The most famous is the Life and Death Book of the Netherworld, followed by the Earth Immortal Book of the Immortal World.” A Buddha shook his head.

Some Buddhas also doubted it. “Since it’s a curse, how can the other party leave any traces behind? Could the other party have shown you a book to mislead you?”

Many Buddhas nodded in agreement.

The Heavenly Dao Buddha fell into deep thought.

He couldn’t guess the other party’s identity.

It wasn’t difficult for him to hide his Dharma treasure.

Could it be that he really exposed the book on purpose?

The Heavenly Dao Buddha frowned. The more he thought about it, the more uneasy he became. After all, the calamity was coming. He didn’t want the Buddhist Sect to be the first to face it.

No matter how the Buddhas discussed it, they couldn’t think of the true murderer’s identity.

Han Jue’s presence was too small. Even the Heavenly Dao Buddha didn’t care about him and didn’t even know of his existence.

In his opinion, the reason why the Supreme Buddha and the Ancient Spiritual Ginseng stayed in the Reroll World was definitely the Heavenly Emperor’s plan. Earlier in the Reroll World, there were Divine Lord Wu De and Flame Lord Emperor. It was enough to hide Han Jue’s existence.

The Dragon Subduing Buddha and the Heavenly Rage Buddha also didn’t reveal Han Jue’s existence because he was too weak. Although they wanted to kill him, they didn’t think much of him.

The reason why Han Jue didn’t die was that the Heavenly Emperor was protecting him!

Another half a year passed.

Apart from the Demon Emperor, all the enemies with three stars and above Hatred Points were cursed to death by Han Jue.

He had lost a million years of his lifespan. He was still far from the self-imposed limit of a hundred million.

Han Jue felt better.

The sky had never been so blue, and the air had never been so fresh.

“Master, you’re very happy. What were you doing just now?” Dao Comprehension Sword couldn’t help but ask. When she saw Han Jue bleeding from his seven orifices, she was almost frightened to death.

Han Jue said seriously, “Just pretend that you didn’t see this. You’re not allowed to tell anyone, including my disciples. If you dare to tell anyone, both of us will die.”

Dao Comprehension Sword’s face turned pale.

Was it that serious?

She hurriedly promised, “I’ve already forgotten about this!”

Han Jue nodded and said meaningfully, “The world is about to be overturned. At that time, we won’t have anywhere to hide even if we want to. Hurry up and cultivate. Don’t keep staring at me.”

Dao Comprehension Sword blushed in embarrassment.

On the other side, inside the Daoist temple.

The White-Robed Buddha looked at the sky outside the door and muttered, “Why isn’t he here yet?”

The Thirteenth Prince had said that he would definitely make him pay the price. However, after waiting for a few years, the Thirteenth Prince did not come.

Could it be that the Heavenly Court had made a move?

The White-Robed Buddha sighed. Just as he was about to cultivate, a figure appeared in front of him.

It was the Heavenly Dao Buddha! The White – Robed Buddha almost peed his pants.

Heavenly Dao Buddha said expressionlessly, “Don’t worry. I can’t touch you. I just want to ask you something.”

The White-Robed Buddha pretended to be calm and asked, “What is it?”

“Who killed the Victorious Fighting Buddha?” the Heavenly Dao Buddha asked.

When the White-Robed Buddha heard that, he knew that the Heavenly Dao Buddha was looking for Han Jue.

He said, “The Immortal Emperor of the Jie School attacked.”

The Heavenly Dao Buddha frowned. “How is that possible? Why would the Jie School attack?”

“The Immortal Emperor of the Jie School is arrogant. He wants the Victorious Fighting Buddha’s body to resurrect an ancient mighty figure,” the white-robed Buddha said.

He was a disciple of the Chan School in the past and was extremely against the Jie School. In the Immeasurable Calamity, the three schools of the Dao Sect fought among themselves and perished together. Even today, they were still mortal enemies.

The Heavenly Dao Buddha was silent.

A moment later, his figure vanished.

The White-Robed Buddha heaved a sigh of relief and secretly admired Han Jue.

How impressive. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Even after killing the Victorious Fighting Buddha, the Heavenly Dao Buddha did not detect him.

The White-Robed Buddha made up his mind to cozy up to Han Jue.

The world was huge. Now, he could only stay here, and he had to rely on the Reroll World to achieve the Emperor Realm.

Heavenly Court!

In the Imperial Garden.

The Heavenly Emperor was reading a scroll in the pavilion when the figure of the Heavenly Dao Buddha appeared.

“Did the Victorious Fighting Buddha die in the hands of your Heavenly Court?” he asked.

The Heavenly Emperor glanced at him and said, “I wish. He killed so many of our immortals and gods.”

Han Jue was the Heavenly Emperor’s trump card. He couldn’t be exposed.

Although he didn’t know why the Heavenly Dao Buddha asked, the Heavenly Emperor still wanted to help Han Jue. Therefore, he said, “The Victorious Fighting Buddha was killed by a mysterious mighty figure when he approached the Reroll World. Even I can’t guess his background.”

Heavenly Dao Buddha frowned.

Could it really be the Jie School?

Speaking of which, the Buddhist Sect indeed had a grudge against the Jie School. Many of their disciples came from there.
