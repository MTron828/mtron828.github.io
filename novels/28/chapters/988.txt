Chapter 990 Devil Trampling Road

“The Chaotic Assembly is about to begin. All geniuses who want to participate in the Chaotic Assembly, please wait in front of any city!”

The Ultimate God of Punishment’s voice resounded throughout the entire Ten Absolute City. As soon as he finished speaking, countless arrogant figures leaped up like a rain of arrows. It was a spectacular sight.

Han Jue sent Han Qing’er to Han Huang’s side.

The mighty figures below became nervous. They were very curious about the rules of the Chaotic Assembly.

!!

This event had been prepared for ten million years. There were countless theories regarding its rules, but the Ultimate God of Punishment and the Divine Might Heavenly Sage had never determined it.

A huge screen of light appeared in front of Han Jue and the Ultimate God of Punishment. It reflected a world. This world was vast and silent. At a glance, the wasteland was undulating and there was no life at all.

The mighty figures discussed it. Could this be the first stage of the Chaotic Assembly?

At the same time, such a screen of light appeared above the various city gates of Ten Absolute City. The desolate world reflected in it attracted the discussion of countless geniuses.

The Five Great Divine Punishers, Han Huang, Jiang Jueshi, Han Qing’er, Chu Shiren, Murong Qi, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, Qin Ling, Han Yu, the Black Hell Chicken, and so on gathered in front of a city.

The Black Hell Chicken suddenly said, “Could it be that every city gate is a trial area? Will there be internal strife if we all squeeze together?”

The others frowned.

They knew the Hidden Sect’s strength the best. They would not be able to withstand it if they really fought in the first round.

“Probably not. Look at the illusions on the city gate. Besides, Grandmaster didn’t remind us when we gathered.” Murong Qi shook his head.

The others felt that it made sense and nodded.

Zhao Shuangquan and Azure Heaven Mystic stood not far away. They looked at the lineup of the Hidden Sect and were secretly shocked.

They knew that the Hidden Sect had a strong foundation, but they didn’t expect it to be so terrifying. There were no less than twenty Great Dao Sages.

Han Huang was also very surprised, but he did not show it.

The Black Hell Chicken came over and stood behind him. “In any case, I’ll follow Han Huang. Do as you wish!”

Han Huang smiled and said, “Alright, I’ll protect you as long as the rules allow it, Master Chicken!”

Guan Bubai snorted. “Junior Huang, the Eternal Peak isn’t yours. I won’t give in to

you.”

The other Fiendcelestials shouted.

Jiang Yi said angrily, “What are you pretending for? The three of us haven’t even spoken. Be careful not to encounter us in the top ten thousand and be directly eliminated!”

Zhao Xuanyuan also smiled proudly.

The Hidden Sect had many people, so it naturally attracted the attention of the other geniuses nearby. Seeing them posture like this, although the geniuses were unhappy, they did not dare to show themselves.

Their auras combined were too strong!

At this moment, the voice of the Ultimate God of Punishment resounded throughout the city.

“First stage of the Chaotic Assembly, Devil Trampling Road! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“What you see is the Resentful Devil Prison at the bottom of the Chaos. All of you will be teleported to the edge of the Resentful Devil Prison. You will reach the center of the prison in a month. You’ll be considered to have passed after passing the teleportation formation and returning to the Ten Absolute City. There is no limit to the number of people who can pass.

“Prodigies can use any schemes and methods. As long as you clear the level. I’ll remind you. The closer you are to the center of the Resentful Devil Prison, the more Resentful Devils there are. Their cultivation levels will also constantly increase. We won’t stop even if there are casualties!

“In two hours, all the geniuses who stay in front of the city gate will be teleported to the Devil Trampling Road. You still have time to leave!”

Countless geniuses began to discuss.

However, no prodigy left. Those who could come here were not mortals. They had prepared for ten million years for this event. How could they leave just like that?

The weakest person present was a Primordial Chaos Sage. They all had life-saving methods. They had a way to revive even if they died on the Devil Trampling Road.

In the hall.

The mighty figures also chatted about the Devil Trampling Road.

“This rule is not bad. It’s a good opportunity to let the geniuses know that the Chaos is not absolutely peaceful.”

“The Devil Trampling Road not only tests one’s strength, but also communication and courage.”

“The first round is interesting. I wonder how many rounds there are.”

“What if less than ten thousand people pass?”

“Don’t worry. Don’t underestimate the prodigies. We definitely won’t be able to decide the top ten thousand in this stage.”

Han Ling also began to talk to her father in a low voice. She was very interested in the Resentful Devils.

Han Jue smiled and said, “Do you regret it? You could have participated.”

“Not really.”

Han Ling shook her head firmly.

The Ultimate God of Punishment glanced at her and was secretly curious.

For some reason, he felt that Han Ling was very talented. She might be able to compete for the Eternal Peak, but she did not participate.

He thought of Han Jue and suddenly understood something.

This was really his master.

He would never reveal his trump cards.

Two hours passed quickly. A light appeared in front of more than a hundred city gates in Ten Absolute City. All the geniuses disappeared and were sent into the Resentful Devil Prison by the Ultimate God of Punishment.

The first round of the Chaotic Assembly had begun!

The geniuses of the Heavenly Dao and the Hidden Sect landed someplace in the Resentful Devil Prison. To be precise, the geniuses in front of every city gate landed together.

They were all geniuses, so they naturally would not shout. The scene was a little strange.

They all knew that they couldn’t do this alone. The more people there were, the safer it was.

Dao Sovereign flew up and shouted, “Heavenly Dao, Hidden Sect, follow me!”

Han Huang, Han Qing’er, Chu Shiren, Murong Qi, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, Han Ming, the Black Hell Chicken, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, Zhao Shuangquan, Azure Heaven Mystic, the War Buddha, the Five Great Divine Punishers, and so on followed. It was a huge commotion.

This team contained dozens of Great Dao Sages, giving the other geniuses immense pressure.

“As expected of the Hidden Sect of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. How powerful.”

“Even the Divine Punishers are following.”

“Nonsense. Don’t you know that the leader of the Divine Punishers is the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s biological son?”.

“This lineup… the Hidden Sect is actually so strong. Even I want to join it.”

“Haha, don’t talk nonsense. A mighty figure must be paying attention outside. Your elders might be angry.”

For a time, the other geniuses also began to advance in groups.

A few cultivators chose to fight alone. As they advanced, the atmosphere of the Heavenly Dao and Hidden Sect was cheerful. They chatted with each other and did not feel any pressure.

Even the most stable Fang Liang and Chu Shiren were relaxed.

Nothing could happen with so many fellow disciples moving together!

Han Qing’er was the most excited. She pulled Han Tuo with her left hand and Han Huang with her right hand, chattering non-stop.

The two brothers doted on this younger sister.

Han Tuo suddenly looked at Han Huang and asked with a smile, “Second Brother, how confident are you about the Eternal Peak?”

Han Huang looked at his brother and smiled. “Of course, I’m 100% confident. I’m determined to win. Brother, don’t give in to me and try your best when the time comes. We’re brothers. I won’t be hypocritical with you. I’ve long wanted to spar with you!”

Amused, Han Tuo also smiled. “Of course. However, don’t let your guard down. I won’t let you win so easily.”

Yi Tian came over and laughed. “Han Huang, not to mention your brother, your greatest opponent is me!”

Behind them, Chu Shiren stared at Han Huang’s back. It was unknown what he was thinking

Murong Qi and Fang Liang approached him. Murong Qi smiled and asked, “What? You have ambitions too?”
