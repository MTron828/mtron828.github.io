Chapter 711 Strength That Overturns Logic

Han Jue’s Sage Sense quickly searched in the Chaos and constantly covered the universe and planes. He observed everything along the way at an incomprehensible speed.

Countless images flashed through his mind.

After about a minute, Han Jue finally found the mysterious domain where Han Tuo was.

This domain was sealed by a mysterious and powerful restriction. No wonder the Evil Heavenly Emperor said that he couldn’t escape.

Han Jue’s eyes narrowed. He raised his right hand and pointed his index finger in Han Tuo’s direction.

A terrifying aura spread out, shocking the Sages. They looked at him in shock.

How terrifying…

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was scared out of his wits.

This aura…

He instantly thought of his teacher.

His previous sensation was true. Han Jue was really as powerful as his teacher!

No wonder he could always easily kill the enemy every time he attacked!

So he was a Great Dao Sage!

The other Sages didn’t think of this. They only stared at Han Jue in awe.

Li Daokong, Fang Liang, Huang Zuntian, and the other Sages enslaved by the Primordial Heavenly Prison all looked at Han Jue in admiration.

Shi Dudao’s eyes also flashed with surprise.

What realm was Han Jue at?

Han Jue’s index finger suddenly shot out a sword Qi and instantly rushed into the Dark Forbidden Zone, disappearing without a trace.

Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger!

Every time Han Jue broke through, he would increase his Sword Dao Mystical Powers. This Mystical Power also increased to the Great Dao level. Of course, it only had the power of the Great Dao and didn’t have the profundities of the Great Dao Mystical Power itself.

Han Jue specially used the Dharma Idol Fusion Technique to gather the power of many Dharma Idols and fused them into the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger. Among them, it included the Traversal Fiendcelestial, the Space-splitting Fiendcelestial, the Destruction Fiendcelestial, the Time Fiendcelestial, the Space Fiendcelestial, the Strength Fiendcelestial, and so on.

This attack had to penetrate the mysterious spatial restriction and give the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the others a way to escape!

In the blood-colored starry sky, the Evil Heavenly Emperor, Han Tuo, Yi Tian, Zhou Fan, and dozens of generals gathered on a huge rock. A huge circle of light wrapped around them and helped them resist the attacks from all directions.

They stared at the battle between the Inauspicious Divine Emperor and the Chaotic Fiendcelestial in the distance.

The descendants of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial were densely packed. More and more of them crawled onto the body of the Inauspicious Divine Emperor like ants eating an elephant. The scene was extremely terrifying.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor sighed and looked at Han Tuo. “I’ve already visited your father in his dreams. I asked him to say one last thing to you. He hopes that you won’t die too cowardly.”

Hearing this, Han Tuo’s expression changed. The fear and despair in his eyes immediately disappeared.

Han Jue’s words seemed to inject the last bit of strength into him, making him feel refreshed. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Yi Tian looked at him enviously. He still had his family to entrust him with before he died. This was what he yearned for the most and was the most impossible thing.

Also standing up as if he was on steroids, Zhou Fan roared, “That’s right! My master is right! We chose this path. Since we want to fight, we’ll die in battle. How can we wait for death here?

“If you want to die, die exhausted instead of waiting for the enemy to tear us apart!”

The generals and Heavenly Generals of the Great Dao Tower were stimulated. They stood up and roared to encourage themselves.

The current situation was already a dead end. It was impossible for anyone to save them!

Han Tuo’s father was far away in the Heavenly Dao, so it was even more impossible for him to come and save him.

The Heavenly Dao was so far away. Even a Pseudo-Sage might not be able to find the way to the Heavenly Dao.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor was also encouraged by them. He thought of Han Jue’s words and felt that they were directed at him.

The reason why he sent a dream to Han Jue was not to seek help. He originally wanted the Great Dao Concealing Fiendcelestial to save Han Tuo. At least, he wouldn’t let Han Jue down. However, the Great Dao Concealing Fiendcelestial was helpless. He said that Han Jue had grasped a summoning Mystical Power and might be able to save his son himself.

Unfortunately, Han Jue’s words meant that he couldn’t save his son either.

He would die, anyway!

Then, he would die a spectacular death!

The Evil Heavenly Emperor suddenly stood up. Dragon Qi erupted and transformed into nine golden dragons that broke through the circle of light. This time, their last defense was gone and they could only fight to the death.

“Children of the Heavenly Court! I’ve wronged you. I can only die with you!”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s voice resounded throughout the starry sky.

The eyes of the Heavenly Troops turned red.

They didn’t blame the Evil Heavenly Emperor. Instead, they had no regrets!

In every battle, the Evil Heavenly Emperor would follow them. He never watched from the back and was never afraid of death!

They did not regret following such a master!

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill

“

The Heavenly Troops shouted in unison. Although there were not many of them, they were extremely infectious.

The generals of the Great Dao Tower were also stimulated. They all had the heart to die without regrets!

Zhou Fan took out the Great Dao Tower, and it quickly rose.

At this moment!

ess

A terrifying pressure descended, causing the shouts to instantly stop.

The fighting Inauspicious Divine Emperor and Chaotic Fiendcelestial suddenly stopped as if the scene had frozen.

They turned around and looked behind the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the others.

Sensing their gazes, the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the others were all frightened. Facing the gaze of the Great Dao Sage, they could not withstand it.

Boom!

The Evil Heavenly Emperor, Zhou Fan, Han Tuo, Yi Tian, and the others heard a deafening roar from behind. They subconsciously wanted to turn around, but before they could see anything, a terrifying sword Qi flashed past their heads and attacked the Chaotic Fiendcelestial with a domineering aura.

All the Fiendcelestial Soldiers along the way turned into dust by the sword Qi!

The Evil Heavenly Emperor and the others widened their eyes as they watched the sword Qi pierce through the Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s body.

The blood-colored starry sky seemed to be torn apart by the sword Qi, splitting the scene in front of them into two.

Shocking!

Spectacular!

They were all dumbfounded, their minds blank.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor reacted the fastest. He seemed to have thought of something and suddenly turned around.

A huge black hole appeared behind him, connecting to another void. “Run! The restriction is broken!” the Evil Heavenly Emperor roared angrily, waking everyone up.

They turned around and rushed into the black hole, quickly leaving the blood-colored starry sky.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked back. The Inauspicious Divine Emperor took advantage of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s injuries and immediately attacked.

That sword Qi…

The Evil Heavenly Emperor revealed a look of disbelief.

A bold thought appeared in his mind, making him exclaim in his heart, How is that possible?!

It was Han Jue!

It was Han Jue’s aura!

How could he be so powerful?

He broke through the restriction that even the Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial could not break with a single strike and even injured the Chaotic Fiendcelestial?

The Evil Heavenly Emperor felt that his understanding was subverted by Han Jue again.

The first time was because of Han Jue’s talent.

This time, it was overturned by Han Jue’s strength.

The others were very excited after surviving the calamity.

Yi Tian couldn’t help but curse. “Damn it! We can escape even in this situation? How many times has it been?! Your Majesty, the mighty figure backing you is too strong! He’s simply omnipotent!”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled bitterly.

It was not the mighty figure behind him.

It was clearly…

The Evil Heavenly Emperor couldn’t help but look at Han Tuo.

Han Tuo felt his gaze and his eyelids twitched.

Could it be…
