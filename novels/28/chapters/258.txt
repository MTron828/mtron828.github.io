Chapter 259 Immeasurable Emperor, Dragon Race’s Invasion

After playing the simulation trial for two hours, Han Jue became more proficient in using the Great Traversal Divine Shadow.

He was very satisfied with this Mystical Power. Currently, he could at most execute nine Great Traversal Divine Shadows at the same time. Every Great Traversal Divine Shadow could erupt with the same powerful strength as his main body. This was very terrifying!

The flaw was that it consumed too much Dharmic power. Although the Dharmic powers of an Immortal Emperor were endless, there was a limit to the amount of recovery. However, when the output of Dharmic powers exceeded the amount of recovery, it would result in a burden or even a loss.

This flaw was nothing. Han Jue would defeat his opponent in the shortest time possible. If his opponent far exceeded him, there was no need to fight.

Han Jue was in a good mood, so he took out the Book of Misfortune and started celebrating

Several months later.

Han Jue was about to cultivate when he suddenly recalled the Immeasurable Calamity.

Wait!

Pan Xin had experienced the Immeasurable Calamity. If he asked him, he would definitely be able to obtain a more accurate answer.

With that thought, Han Jue’s essence soul jumped into the Sword Dao River.

He quickly arrived behind Pan Xin and asked respectfully, “Senior, can I ask you about the Immeasurable Calamity?”.

Pan Xin turned around and asked, “What do you want to ask?”

“Is the Immeasurable Calamity coming? How much longer until it comes? How long will it last?”

“Tsk tsk, you’re not simple. You can actually sense the providence of the Immeasurable Calamity. That’s right, the next calamity is about to arrive. The Immeasurable Calamity is different from other calamities. It might take tens of thousands of years to rise, but it can also last for tens of thousands of years. In history, the fastest Immeasurable Calamity lasted for nearly ten thousand years. Currently, it’s only the beginning. To begin, it still has to wait for the person meant to face the calamity to mature.”

“The person meant to face the calamity?”

“Yes, every Immeasurable Calamity has a person who will face it. He will be the trigger to starting it. At that time, the negative karma of the world will spread, and all living beings will develop inner demons. They will fall into endless slaughter until the Heavenly Dao feels balanced, and only then will the calamity dissipate.”

Han Jue was deep in thought.

This Immeasurable Calamity was an elimination game?

Battle Royale?

When the remaining people reached a certain number, the calamity would disappear?

Wasn’t the best way to survive the Immeasurable Calamity to hide, then?

He didn’t have to fight for first place.

Han Jue asked, “Senior, did you survive the Immeasurable Calamity before?”

Pan Xin immediately raised his nose proudly.

“Of course. I’ve transcended too many Immeasurable Calamities. Those who can obtain great providence in the Immeasurable Calamity can become the Master of Calamity and have endless providence, gaining immortality even in the face of countless tribulations.” Pan Xin’s words made Han Jue think of the Heavenly Emperor and the Demon Emperor. They were both Immeasurable Emperors.

So that was what the Immeasurable Emperor meant.

Pan Xin smiled and said, “Boy, if you survive this Immeasurable Calamity, I’ll take you in as my disciple. On account of our affinity.”

Han Jue raised his eyebrows and asked, “Can we avoid the next Immeasurable Calamity after passing it?”

Pan Xin said casually, “Not necessarily. The Immeasurable Calamity might depend on karma. Karma is difficult to measure. For example, if you want to avoid the calamity, your beloved Dao Companion or disciple will be killed in the calamity. Do you want revenge? If you do, you will enter the calamity and won’t be able to escape.

“It’s very difficult for a person to completely avoid karma. Even if you can bear not to save them, the disciples, friends, and relatives who wanted you to save them will hate you. After the calamity ends, you will turn against each other and cause trouble for the next calamity.

“Besides, the Immeasurable Calamity itself is a great opportunity to kill enemies and snatch providence. In the calamity, one can constantly surpass their limits. Many Deity Realm and even Zenith Heaven immortals don’t have such high talent. They rely on the Immeasurable Calamity to seize providence.

“With your cultivation level, it’s difficult for you to avoid the tribulation because you can’t find a place where you can completely avoid it.”

Towards the end, Pan Xin’s tone was filled with disdain.

Han Jue didn’t feel offended. He bowed and thanked him before quickly leaving.

Pan Xin found it strange. This kid seemed to be very serious.

Forget it.

He couldn’t be bothered to deal with him.

Pan Xin’s right shoulder continued to shake.

Ten years later.

Han Jue left his cultivation state again and started cursing the enemies.

Knowing that the Immeasurable Calamity was coming, Han Jue hoped to curse all his enemies to death.

At that time, he could avoid calamity in peace.

In addition, he had stricter requirements for the disciples’ cultivation. Everyone had to reach a goal within a certain period of time. If they failed, they would be severely punished.

Han Jue didn’t want these disciples to be weak and wait for him to save them when the calamity arrived.

For a time, the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain stirred up a trend of cultivation. Even Chu Shiren didn’t dare to be careless anymore. On this day.

Han Jue was still cursing the enemy when he suddenly felt a terrifying aura.

A black crack appeared at the end of the world, and wisps of terrifying black aura seeped out. Han Jue sensed dozens of auras.

The strongest was a Grand Unity Golden Immortal, while the weakest was a Grand Unity True Immortal.

Han Jue immediately contacted the security guard, White-Robed Buddha, and asked him to block it.

The White-Robed Buddha immediately headed over.

Han Jue continued cursing the enemy. He couldn’t panic when facing trouble, especially when cursing the enemy. He couldn’t be interrupted. Once he was interrupted, Han Jue’s mood would turn bad.

Outside the cave.

The Fusang Tree shook violently again, causing the Black Hell Chicken, Ah Da, and Xiao Er to be unable to stay on it in peace.

Long Hao sensed something and suddenly stood up, looking at the sky.

“What’s wrong?” Han One asked curiously.

Long Hao’s gaze was solemn as he muttered, “I sense the aura of the Dragon Race.”

He also had the bloodline of a True Dragon, so he felt it very strongly.

Xun Chang’an also looked into the distance and muttered, “The trouble of the Reroll World is coming.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He didn’t panic. After all, his master was here.

Heavenly Court, in a spacious hall.

Fang Liang sat in a huge cauldron. The medicine boiled and burned his body red. Murong Qi stood beside the cauldron staring at him.

“Senior, I’m fine. Go back. You don’t have to look after me.” Fang Liang opened his eyes and forced a smile. Murong Qi shook his head and said, “This medicine contains the blood essence of a Demon Saint. It’s extremely domineering and cannot be taken lightly. You don’t have to care about me.”

Fang Liang gave up helplessly. He changed the topic and said, “Recently, His Majesty the Heavenly Emperor is selecting a new Great General. Do you want to participate?” Great General was an existence higher than a Heavenly General!

Currently, there were only the Three Great Generals in the Heavenly Court!

Murong Qi’s cultivation speed was extremely fast. He had already reached the Grand Unity Mystic Immortal Realm. With such talent, he had a chance to become a Great General. In addition to his previous life’s identity, no Immortal God dared to refute.

Although Murong Qi’s cultivation was not outstanding, immortals greeted him wherever he went. Not long ago, the Martial God General had even looked for him to reminisce.

Murong Qi smiled and said, “His Majesty the Heavenly Emperor has already talked to me. I will participate and help Grandmaster gain a foothold. Grandmaster is most afraid of trouble. If he comes to the Heavenly Court in the future, we will also help him fend off trouble.”

Fang Liang nodded and asked with a reminiscent expression, “By the way, what cultivation level do you think Grandmaster is at now?”

After coming to the Heavenly Court, due to his aptitude and identity, he learned about the Immortal World, and his knowledge increased greatly.

Murong Qi said, “Grandmaster has always been mysterious. I suspect that he himself is an ancient mighty figure, but he has always been hiding in the mortal world. Have you ever seen Grandmaster helpless or in a sorry state? No enemy can withstand a single blow from him.”
