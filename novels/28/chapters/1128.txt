Chapter 1131 Dream of a Deity

“He’s already dead.” Han Jue smiled. Chu Xiaoqi looked up at him in surprise.

“Grandpa, you killed him?”

“No, it was you. He was already dead when I arrived. He should have suffered from Qi Deviation and forcefully possessed someone. He died by his own hands.”

“I see. Then I killed him. Hahaha, I set him up to suffer from Qi Deviation.”

Chu Xiaoqi turned to look at Tang Wan, who was walking over from not far away. He smiled proudly and said, “Wan’er, I was acting earlier to make him let down his guard.”

Tang Wan nodded. “I believe your crying, but I don’t think you can pee your pants for an act. I can’t do it, anyway.”

Chu Xiaoqi was embarrassed and did not know how to refute.

Tang Wan took the initiative to bow to Han Jue. She introduced herself a little nervously.

Han Jue smiled kindly, but with his appearance, his smile was not kind but gentle. Tang Wan blushed.

Chu Xiaoqi widened his eyes and shouted, “Damn it, Wan’er, don’t tell me you want to be my grandmother? That won’t do!”

“What nonsense are you saying!”

Tang Wan was furious. She naturally didn’t fall in love with Han Jue at first sight. However, he was so handsome and

unfathomable, so she naturally couldn’t face him casually.

Han Jue said angrily, “Don’t go around acknowledging your grandmother. Your grandmother just left not long ago. She might be eavesdropping from somewhere. Be careful she doesn’t deal with you.”

Hearing this, Chu Xiaoqi hurriedly jumped up and looked around, kowtowing in different directions.

Tang Wan rolled her eyes. This fellow was very imposing when he was serious, but he was usually very unreasonable. He was simply a freak.

Han Jue smiled. “Alright, don’t cause trouble. Rest well. There won’t be any danger nearby for the time being.”

Chu Xiaoqi stood up and nodded excitedly. It felt good to survive.

For the next period of time, Han Jue sat by the river. Tang Wan and Chu Xiaoqi cultivated not far away and occasionally practiced their spells.

Tang Wan was very curious about Han Jue.

She asked how they met when the two of them went out to find herbs. After knowing the process of their encounter, Tang Wan felt that Han Jue must be an expert. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

That green-robed Daoist had definitely died in Han Jue’s hands!

However, Chu Xiaoqi did not think of this.

This fellow was really naive.

In the blink of an eye, more than half a year passed.

Chu Xiaoqi was worried that the sect would find them and suggested that they change locations. Han Jue had no objections to this. To him, it didn’t matter where he went. He couldn’t be bothered to argue with them.

Just like that, Han Jue and Chu Xiaoqi embarked on the path of the world again, but

with one more person this time.

Chu Xiaoqi and Tang Wan flew on their

swords, while Han Jue rode a cloud as usual.

This method surprised Tang Wan.

Wasn’t that the legendary Immortal? Tang Wan was even more respectful towards

Han Jue.

Several months later, the three of them

arrived at a villa. The nearby mountains were steep and no one could be seen within a

thousand miles. It was like a paradise. However, there was no one in this villa. Han

Jue could see many ghosts hidden inside. The people of this villa had been slaughtered in the past and the ghosts refused to reincarnate, so it became a ghost village.

Tang Wan felt that this place was sinister and

did not dare to walk alone. She kept following Chu Xiaoqi, but he did not care. With his grandfather around, Chu Xiaoqi felt that he wouldn’t be afraid even if the sky

collapsed.

Han Jue felt that this place was not bad and agreed to stay.

It was a good opportunity to increase Chu Xiaoqi’s cultivation.

As night fell, Tang Wan did not dare to stay alone. She found Chu Xiaoqi, and the two of them stayed in the same room.

Tang Wan was at the Foundation Establishment realm, after all, but she still felt uneasy entering this place. The two of

them were not mortals and did not need to sleep. They cultivated together. However, every night, they could hear the

faint cries of women and children. This made Tang Wan even more nervous, and Chu Xiaoqi could not remain calm.

He was a Golden Core realm cultivator. How

strong were ghosts that even he could not

see?

He was indeed very strong!

Han Jue predicted that even if a Nascent Soul

realm cultivator came to this villa, they would also die. The person who slaughtered this villa was at the Tribulation Transcendence Realm and captured all the adult men here. The

consequences of his spell were to make the evil ghosts stronger.

The ghosts here absorbed the essence of the

sun and moon every day and became stronger

all the time.

The reason they didn’t hurt them was naturally because of Han Jue.

He planned to let Chu Xiaoqi deal with these

ghosts as an exam after he became stronger. On this day.

Han Jue was cultivating when a line of words

appeared in front of him.

[The Formless Transcendent Deity sent you a dream. Do you accept?]

With Han Jue’s cultivation, the Dao Creator

shouldn’t be able to visit him in his dreams, but he still lowered his status and gave the Formless Transcendent Deity the right. The Formless Transcendent Deity was now the overseer of the Endless Era, the most powerful existence on the surface.

The dream was a blank domain. The Formless Transcendent Deity bowed respectfully and asked, “Creation Lord, are there requirements towards future Dao Creators?”

Han Jue said, “There’s no need to restrict

them. If they can become a Dao Creator on their own, let nature take its course.” It was very difficult for a Dao Creator to emerge. Even if no other Dao Creator stopped him, it would take countless years for a new Dao Creator to be born.

For example, Han Huang, Han Ling, the

Primordial Ancestor God, the Ultimate God of Punishment, and the other top Great Dao

Supremes who had obtained a Great Creation in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity could not see any hope of becoming a Dao Creator for the time being.

“I observed the future and discovered that a

calamity for Dao Creators might appear in the future. It might be related to the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.”

The Formless Transcendent Deity continued.

After the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil was chased out of the Chaos, he actually disappeared mysteriously. Han Jue couldn’t deduce it. He guessed that it was related to

the Ninth Chaos, so he couldn’t be bothered to use the system’s derivation function. He would continue asking after the Ninth Chaos was completely enslaved.

“Let the Fusang Divine Tree supervise the

future,” Han Jue replied, deciding the Fusang Tree’s status.

The Formless Transcendent Deity nodded, not daring to refute.

He hesitated for a moment and then asked, “Recently, Han Ye has been destroying the Great Dao Worlds everywhere to increase his cultivation. Do I have to do anything about him?” Han Jue said, “Aren’t you unaffected by karma? Let nature take its course. Don’t interfere with things below your level. The Endless Era is a brand-new era. Even I don’t

know what kind of danger will appear in the future. Let all living beings be vigilant.” “Understood.”

After the dream ended.

Han Jue looked at Han Ye. This kid was indeed

a little bloodthirsty. Furthermore, the direction he traveled would coincidentally bump into this world.

According to his calculations, Han Ye would

arrive in this world in at most a hundred million years. His descendants couldn’t be bullied, but he couldn’t let him mess around.

Han Jue suddenly had an idea and smiled.

…

In the blank domain, large worlds were dotted with pale white.

Han Ye, who was surrounded by blood Qi, meditated in the void. His entire body trembled very frequently and his state was

extremely wrong.

At this moment, Han Ye was in a dream. In his dream, a blurry mysterious figure kept

suppressing him, making him very angry.
