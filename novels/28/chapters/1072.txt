Chapter 1074 Developing the Realm

Han Jue was surprised. This fellow wanted to seek refuge with him?

It was indeed beyond Han Jue’s expectations. In his opinion, it was impossible for a Dao Creator to bow his head unless he was

suppressed by stronger experts, just like what the Ninth Chaos did to the other Dao Creators. Han Jue said helplessly, “I’ve only become a Dao Creator not long ago. How can I match him?”

He asked in his mind, “Is the Formless Transcendent Deity sincere in seeking refuge with me?”

[1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[Yes]

This surprised Han Jue even more.

He was sincere.

Could it be because of the Evil Heavenly Emperor?

The Formless Transcendent Deity smiled and said, “If you’re not a match, you’ll immediately leave the dream realm, afraid that you’ll be implicated by me. The fact that you’re still acting humble shows your greatest confidence.”

Han Jue remained silent.

If not for the fact that the Formless

Transcendent Deity was sincere, he would definitely attack him.

He thought about it carefully. There was indeed nothing immoral about the Formless Transcendent Deity’s deeds. He still wanted to sacrifice himself and exchange his life for all Transcendent living beings. This kindness was indeed impressive.

“What will you do if I promise you?” Han Jue narrowed his eyes and asked calmly.

The Formless Transcendent Deity replied, “You can do whatever you want when you become the leader. It’s impossible to take action immediately. If you agree, it’s best to prepare for a period of time. As for the other Dao Creators, I suggest you don’t try to rope them in. Their ambitions are too great and can’t accommodate a second Chaos.”

Han Jue asked in his mind, “Will the Formless Transcendent Deity tell the other Dao Creators if I agree?”

[1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[No]

Han Jue was relieved. The Dao Creators he mentioned included the Ninth Chaos. It was okay as long as the Formless Transcendent

Deity didn’t do this.

“Make your decision. The Chaos looks benevolent, but that’s only if you don’t threaten him. As long as you threaten him, he

will definitely attack you. In addition, the matter of his mental demon has already caused

him to change. If we aren’t prepared, we will be doomed sooner or later.”

The Formless Transcendent Deity spoke again with a helpless tone.

This kid was good at everything, but he was too cautious. He was even a little too cowardly,

reaching a level that the Formless Transcendent Deity could not understand.

Han Jue said, “Alright, but you can’t tell anyone about this, including the Evil Heavenly Emperor. You understand that as long as others know, they will be deduced by the Dao Creators sooner or later.”

The Formless Transcendent Deity smiled. “Don’t worry, I won’t let you fight alone. I will nurture a group of cultivators before the final battle comes. I will also help you resist the other Dao Creators if you fight with the Chaos.”

Han Jue was satisfied. “That’s all. Wait for the

situation to develop for now.”

“Are you about to break through?”

“How is that possible?”

Han Jue shook his head and laughed. Then, he

removed the dream.

[Formless Transcendent Deity has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 6

stars]

Han Jue saw this notification the moment he opened his eyes, making him even more

satisfied with him.

Not bad, not bad.

Very sensible.

Subduing the Formless Transcendent Deity was

a good thing for Han Jue, but not a great thing.

He had originally planned to throw the Dao Creators into the Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison after becoming a Creator Lord.

He didn’t feel this was shameful. If it was any

other Dao Creator, they would definitely not hold back if they could deal with the other Dao Creators.

At their cultivation realm, morals were already meaningless.

Mortals’ morals restricted them. They only

compared who was stronger and who was

weaker.

The Ninth Chaos didn’t dare to deal with him because of the Dao Field. Otherwise, the Ninth Chaos would definitely suppress him and make his Ultimate Origin World fuse with the Chaos like the other Great Dao Worlds.

He could give others a way out, but he couldn’t give them a chance to threaten him. At this moment, the Nine Divine Stars had

already woken up from the simulation trial. Their expressions were ugly.

They didn’t even dare to look at Han Jue.

Shan’e was extremely happy to see their expressions.

Who asked you to court death!

Do you know how terrifying the progenitor is

now? Han Jue didn’t care. He was waiting for the Dao

Field to upgrade, but it still didn’t finish even after so much time had passed.

That made sense. After all, the protective array 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

formation of the Dao Field had already reached

the Creator Lord level. Who knew how long it would take to increase it?

Han Jue asked in his mind, “Can the Ultimate Origin Spirit Stone upgrade an Ultimate Supreme Treasure?”

[Not for the time being. The Ultimate Supreme

Treasure is already the strongest Dharma treasure. Unless you reach the Creator Lord

Realm and open up a higher realm, you can’t upgrade an Ultimate Supreme Treasure.] Unknowingly, Han Jue had already reached the level of a pioneer.

No living being had become a Creator Lord ever since everything was born!

Han Jue looked forward to that day even more.

Then, he closed his eyes and continued cultivating.

Time passed quickly. The Chaos fell into unprecedented chaos. The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil also became the nightmare of all living

beings. The evil devils formed their own race and caused chaos from time to time. Transcendent, Consciousnessless, and Shi Tian had also completely fused into the Chaos. They

were no longer Great Dao Worlds, but separate domains.

The Chaos was already used to the existence of

evil devils when Han Jue reached 210 million years old.

Another Chaotic Assembly was about to begin. This time, the theme had become suppressing the evil devils. Of course, the core was still the

genius competition.

Han Jue opened his eyes and started to check his emails.

Next, he began the simulation trial.

He still treated the Immeasurable Destruction

Venerable as his opponent.

Several days later, Han Jue left the simulation

trial and felt bored. “Why isn’t it done yet?”

Han Jue sighed in his heart. He always thought

of the Dao Field.

He stood up and left the Dao Field. Transcendent Domain, Heavenly Court.

Han Jue came to a palace. This place was as

beautiful as a painting. Immortal floors and immortal cranes were lined up. As expected of the Heavenly Court.

Only Han Qing’er was in the palace. She was

playing with a small and exquisite silver umbrella.

Han Jue suddenly appeared in front of her,

scaring her so much that she hurriedly jumped

away.

“Father!”

Han Qing’er was pleasantly surprised to see him. Then, she looked reproachful.

“You only know how to scare me!” Han Qing’er snorted, but she was still very happy to see her father.

The father and daughter sat down and started to reminisce.

Han Jue revealed a loving expression. The little girl from back then had already

grown up. This feeling was really wonderful.

Han Jue had always felt that he was not old. It was just that his age increased quickly. “Father, that Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil is too strong. My second brother and fourth don’t have absolute confidence in defeating it even if they join forces. Will you help if the

Chaos is in trouble?”

sister

Facing his daughter’s question, Han Jue smiled

and said, “What? Your father is in seclusion

every day and doesn’t have any combat

strength.”

Han Qing’er curled her lips. “I think you no longer care about the Chaos. Have you also established a Great Dao World? Where?” She was very excited at the mention of the Great Dao World.

Her cultivation level had also reached the Great

Dao Supreme Realm and she began to come

into contact with the Great Dao World. Jiang Jueshi had taught her a lot, but she had never

been able to do anything.
