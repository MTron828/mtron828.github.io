Chapter 321 End of the Dao Lecture, Favorability from the Mighty Figures

Was the Heavenly Dao or the Great Dao better?

What question was this?!

It had to be the Great Dao! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Han Jue cursed in his head. What were the big shots in the first row asking?

Ancestor Xitian replied, “Before attaining the Dao, cultivating the Heavenly Dao is the best. Under the Heavenly Dao, all living beings have to follow its rules. After attaining the Dao, one can cultivate the Great Dao and seek a higher realm. Cultivation has no end. Even I am still exploring the endless possibilities.”

The questioner continued to ask. This time, he asked about the details of cultivation. Han Jue didn’t understand.

There were many questions in the future that Han Jue didn’t understand. It involved Yin-Yang, Eight Trigrams, Providence, Karma, Fate, and so on.

Han Jue had never even learned the basics of these Dao, so he naturally couldn’t understand them.

He didn’t want to understand for the time being. With the Immeasurable Calamity before him, he couldn’t learn other Dao to enrich himself. The most important thing now was to become as strong as possible. After enduring the Immeasurable Calamity, he had plenty of time to fill up his understanding of the Dao.

Some questions could be answered by Ancestor Xitian in a sentence, but he would give a long answer for those that involved cultivation content. One of them lasted for a month. Han Jue could only cultivate quietly to pass the time.

He noticed that many people in the back row were the same. Everyone pretended to listen carefully, but they were actually secretly cultivating

Even if he didn’t understand the lecture, he couldn’t offend Ancestor Xitian.

In the blink of an eye.

Four years passed. An Immortal Emperor in front of him was asking a question. Ancestor Xitian answered faster, and Han Jue gradually understood.

In the first two rows of Han Jue, there were almost no questions about cultivation. It would be a waste to ask. It was better to ask about the general trend and the Dao heart.

“I should follow my heart and ask.”

Han Jue thought to himself. This was a huge opportunity. Who knew when it would come again? After about a month and a half, it was finally Han Jue’s turn.

He felt a divine sense.

It was the concern of the Heavenly Emperor.

Han Jue said, “Ancestor, my question is, has there ever been a mighty figure who achieved the Dao by always cultivating in a low profile manner, staying away from conflict and not entering the calamity?”

With that said, many eyes landed on him.

This question was too strange, even ridiculous.

The Heavenly Emperor shook his head.

Li Daokong smiled. Li Xuan’ao smiled mockingly.

The Demon Emperor and the Heavenly Dao Buddha glanced at Han Jue. Who knew what they were thinking?

They all had hatred towards Han Jue and naturally knew him. They just didn’t know that he was the Dark Forbidden Lord.

Ancestor Xitian said slowly, “When the world was first created, many Connate lifeforms who had just been born were ascetics. They stayed far from the competition, but very few could attain the Dao. The current lifeforms are all Postnatal lifeforms. If we don’t compete for providence, it will be very difficult to attain the Dao.”

Han Jue was deep in thought.

Many mighty figures shook their heads and laughed, feeling that this question was useless.

“However… although it’s very difficult, it’s not impossible. The Immeasurable Calamity will change in the future, and so will the heavens.” Ancestor Xitian’s tone was calm, but the eyes of hundreds of mighty figures flickered.

The Immeasurable Calamity was about to change?

Han Jue fell into deep thought and didn’t take Ancestor Xitian’s words to heart.

He wasn’t affected. He even wanted to laugh. Since no one could do it, his enemies would definitely think that his bitter cultivation was a joke. They wouldn’t be bothered to pay attention to him and think that he was a fool.

The cultivator on Han Jue’s left asked his question.

Time passed. More than five years went by. The lecture in the Great Ultimate Hall officially ended.

The bell rang and all the listeners bowed and left.

After leaving the Great Ultimate Hall, Han Jue met with the Divine General and Long Jun.

The Divine General teased, “I didn’t expect you to be stronger than us. You hid it well.”

Long Jun also looked at him with a meaningful gaze. Han Jue said, “No matter how strong I am, I’m inferior to you. I’m timid and hide in my cave abode every day to cultivate. All I can do is cultivate. You guys are busy with the Heavenly Court’s matters and have little cultivation time. If you are like me, I won’t be able to catch up to you.”

The two of them smiled and did not reply with humble words.

The Heavenly Emperor came in front of him and the other two and said, “Let’s go. It’s time to go back.”

Han Jue and the other two naturally had no objections. He couldn’t wait to go back as soon as possible. The Heavenly Emperor waved his sleeve and wrapped the three of them with his Dharmic powers. Then, he turned into a beam of light and quickly flew away, disappearing into the darkness. The other mighty figures in front of the Great Ultimate Hall also left.

On the way back, Han Jue was very nervous, afraid that the Demon Emperor would suddenly attack.

The Heavenly Emperor was faster this time compared to their initial trip.

In less than five minutes, he sent Han Jue to the void where the Reroll World was previously.

Before he could speak, the Heavenly Emperor and the other two quickly left.

Seeing this, Han Jue hurriedly jumped into the netherworld. After returning to the netherworld, Han Jue finally heaved a sigh of relief. “This time, I can’t go out and listen to the Dao unless I reach the Zenith Heaven Realm,” Han Jue thought.

Apart from his cultivation level increasing, he had also comprehended the Great Dao of Karma.

This Dao was not simple. When he stepped into the Deity Realm, he would cultivate the Dao of Karma and Life and Death. His future would be limitless.

To be safe, Han Jue moved hundreds of thousands of times in the netherworld before jumping back to Hidden Sect Island.

The journey was indeed safe. This was normal. Han Jue’s existence was so low and his reputation was even inferior to ordinary cultivators in the Immortal World. He didn’t take the initiative to provoke the enemy, either. How could he be attacked?

After returning to the Hidden Sect Island, Han Jue gathered all the disciples and told them about the lecture this time. There was no substantial content. He only let the disciples listen to broaden their vision.

He had only comprehended the Great Dao of Karma and could not speak of it.

The Black Hell Demon Lord sighed. “Ancestor Xitian, I used to think that he was a legendary figure of the ancient era. I didn’t expect him to really exist.”

Xun Chang’an was also extremely emotional.

In the past, the Buddha was the strongest existence in his eyes. Now, he heard from Han Jue that the Heavenly Dao Buddha was also respectful in front of Ancestor Xitian like a junior. He had really overestimated himself.

The disciples’ blood boiled as their cultivation passion was ignited.

Han Jue instructed them and then returned to the Connate Cave Abode.

He began the simulation trial.

To prevent the system from being exposed, he deliberately set a restriction on the data set by the hundreds of mighty figures in the Great Ultimate Hall. Only Han Jue could challenge them. The other disciples couldn’t see them during the simulation trial.

After all, there were more than a few disciples in the Hidden Sect. Han Jue had to be careful.

Just like his clone Liu Bei, Han Jue would also be on guard. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust them, but that he was afraid of being soul-searched and deduced by the enemy.

It was better to be safe than sorry!

Han Jue began to absorb Qi to cultivate and increase his soul’s strength.

As for the Great Dao of Karma, he would cultivate it after stepping into the Deity Realm.

He was already a Rank Six Immortal Emperor. He didn’t know if he could reach the Deity Realm within a thousand years.

Half a year later.

Words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue, who was cultivating.

(Ancestor Xitian has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 1.5 stars]

[Dijun has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 2 stars]

(Jade Bodhi has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 1 star.]

[Seven Dao Sage has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 2 stars]

Han Jue was stunned.

What was going on?

Why were there suddenly four favorability notifications?

They looked like big shots!
