Chapter 222 Heavenly Dao Buddha, Increased Providence

“Alright!” Dao Comprehension Sword picked up the spear and walked out of the cave abode, muttering to herself, “Master wants to focus on nurturing Ling’er?”

The other disciples weren’t given treasures.

Han Jue didn’t know what she was thinking and couldn’t be bothered. He took out the Ancestral Magus blood essence.

The blood essence was stored in a small green jade bottle. Han Jue felt a terrifying murderous aura the moment he opened it!

Wow.

If the blood was already so strong, how strong was the Ancestral Magus when he was at the peak?

Han Jue’s understanding of the Ancestral Magi came from some novels and myths in his previous life, but he couldn’t take them seriously.

This cultivation world seemed to be related to the Investiture of the Gods, Journey to the West, and the Primordial World, but it was also very different.

Han Jue was thinking about how to use the Ancestral Magus blood essence.

His first choice was the Black Hell Chicken.

He was afraid that the chicken would be devoured by the blood essence.

Han Jue probed the Ancestral Magus blood essence with his divine sense. In an instant, he was repelled by a terrifying power.

Han Jue was frightened and broke out in cold sweat.

He hurriedly kept the Ancestral Magus blood essence. He would use it in the future.

If this thing was absorbed into his body, wouldn’t he explode?

After some thinking, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.

Another ten years passed.

As usual, Han Jue cursed and checked his emails.

(Your good friend Jiang Yi comprehended the Sword Dao and became an Immortal Emperor of the Sword Dao.]

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by a fiendish cultivator] x1687

[Your good friend Long Shan has obtained a True Dragon Race divine weapon. His cultivation has increased greatly.]

[Your grand-disciple Fang Liang dreamed of entering the Great Void. His divinity has increased.]

(Your good friend Meng Po was attacked by the Demon Race’s Immortal Emperor] x9

[Your good friend Meng Po was severely injured. Fortunately, a mighty figure from the netherworld saved her.]

(Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren has awakened a Buddhist Mystical Power.]

(Your good friend Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mighty figure.]

Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

The so-called mighty figure should be an existence above the Immortal Emperor.

The system was also constantly upgrading. Anything it couldn’t detect would be a mighty figure.

There were really many mighty figures in the other worlds.

Even the Heavenly Emperor would be attacked.

This Heavenly Court was too dangerous, he couldn’t go there!

Han Jue noticed that Chu Shiren had actually awakened a Buddhist Mystical Power.

Could this fellow have already become the Supreme Buddha?

Several months later.

Han Jue asked Dao Comprehension Sword to call Chu Shiren in. He wanted to talk to him alone.

After Chu Shiren entered, he was a little nervous.

Was Grandmaster going to teach him a Mystical Power?

Please no! Chu Shiren knelt down in front of him.

Han Jue asked, “Have you comprehended a Mystical Power recently?”

Chu Shiren looked up in shock.

How did Grandmaster know?

Chu Shiren said in shame, “I didn’t mean to… It was just a dream. I didn’t expect…”

Han Jue: “…”

This guy was good at posturing!

Han Jue said angrily, “Isn’t it good to become stronger? You said that you don’t want to cultivate, but haven’t you already secretly cultivated to the Mahayana Realm?”

That’s right!

Chu Shiren had already reached the Mahayana Realm!

Ever since Zhou Mingyue became his disciple, he had been secretly cultivating, afraid that he would be caught up. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When Chu Shiren heard that, he immediately felt awkward. He didn’t expect that he would still be seen through by his grandmaster.

“Grandmaster, I keep feeling that if I continue to cultivate, I will become another person. There’s a terrifying power hidden in my body…” Chu Shiren said after mustering his courage.

Han Jue said, “Everyone has their own past life. There’s no need to resist. You’re you. Everything in the past is like smoke and mist. This Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain not only cultivates cultivation, but also mental states. One day, you will be like me, seeing through everything and not thinking about anything. This is cultivation Letting go of everything is the Great Dao.”

Chu Shiren was deep in thought.

For some reason, he felt that Han Jue’s words were filled with meaning.

What did Grandmaster want him to let go of?

Put down his ideals?

Han Jue began to teach him the Mystical Power.

Regardless of whether Chu Shiren would become the Supreme Buddha in the end, since there was an affinity between them, he had to teach him.

Several days later, Chu Shiren left. Han Jue only taught him the cultivation mantra and related memories. The specific cultivation depended on him.

When Zhou Mingyue saw Chu Shiren come out, he hurriedly went up and asked curiously, “Master, did Grandmaster teach you a Mystical Power?”

Chu Shiren nodded.

“Master, teach me too!” Zhou Mingyue said excitedly.

Chu Shiren hesitated for a moment but still nodded.

In a huge, bright hall, a huge golden Buddha sat on a lotus throne.

His figure was like a mountain, and he had a dignified expression. 24 huge Buddha Beads floated behind him emitting various lights.

He was the only one in the hall.

He slowly opened his eyes and muttered, “Supreme Buddha… are you coming back?” He raised his right hand and waved it forward. A Buddhist seal shot out and quickly rushed out of the hall.

Before long…

A monk in white flew in. He had a handsome face and wore white clothes.

“Amitabha. Greetings, Heavenly Dao Buddha.”

The white-robed monk pressed his palms together and bowed.

Heavenly Dao Buddha said, “The Supreme Buddha is about to awaken. Go invite him back.”

Upon hearing that, the white-robed monk frowned.

He said, “The Supreme Buddha is in a mortal world of the Heavenly Court. I’m afraid the Heavenly Emperor won’t agree to this.”

“Do it at all costs.”

“Amitabha.”

The white-robed monk looked helpless but still agreed. Heavenly Dao Buddha raised his hand, and a golden Buddhist staff flew in front of the white-robed monk.

The white-robed monk was pleasantly surprised. “Tathagata Buddha Staff!”.

Heavenly Dao Buddha closed his eyes and said, “I want only success.”

The white-robed monk held the Buddha Staff and nodded solemnly.

Spring passed and autumn came. As time passed, the world became a whole new sight.

Thirty years went by.

Han Jue was still cultivating. He was still a distance away from the mid-stage of the Reincarnation Golden Immortal Realm.

It had already been a hundred years, and he still couldn’t break through a minor realm. It was really difficult to break through at the Golden Immortal Realm.

Han Jue wasn’t in a hurry. He believed that his speed was already fast.

Long Shan was still stuck at the mid-stage Grand Unity True Immortal Realm and had already been left behind by Han Jue.

On this day.

Han Jue suddenly opened his eyes with a strange expression. He sensed that the providence of the Scarlet Cloud World was increasing. In the past, it was difficult to sense it, but ever since he stepped into the Golden Immortal Realm, Han Jue could detect it.

As the providence of the Scarlet Cloud World soared, the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth also began to increase.

Han Jue immediately took out the Heavenly Dao Token and checked the ranking on the Heavenly Dao Tablet.

The Scarlet Cloud World’s ranking was constantly rising.

It was very fast!

Han Jue panicked and hurriedly used the Heavenly Dao Token to observe the Scarlet Cloud World.

He discovered that the Mahayana cultivators hidden in the small world were all breaking through. Their providence was all gathered in the mortal world, causing the providence of the Scarlet Cloud World to constantly rise.

There was something fishy!

Han Jue suspected that these people had formed a group. It was impossible for them to break through together so coincidentally.

Someone must be secretly organizing it.

Han Jue held the Heavenly Dao Token and started to deduce with his fingers.

Soon, he realized it was the Heavenly Immortal Manor.

The Heavenly Dao could reflect everything in the world. Han Jue could spy on the Heavenly Dao in the mortal world, so he naturally knew what the Heavenly Immortal Manor was plotting

So the Heavenly Court had a plan behind this.

A former Heavenly Immortal Manor member from the Heavenly Court sent a dream to the Heavenly Immortal Manor and taught them the technique of providence, allowing the Manor to collude with the mighty figures of the mortal world to strengthen the Scarlet Cloud World.

If they succeeded, the upper limit of the mortal world would no longer be the Mahayana Realm. Just like in Li Yao’s mortal world, it would also be able to support immortals.
