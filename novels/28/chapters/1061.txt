Chapter 1062 Han Jue’s Preparation

Han Huang and Han Ye welcomed powerful enemies again as Han Jue and his Dao Companions discussed the Chaotic War.

This time, it was the Life faction. With Li Daokong as the leader, ten Great Dao Supremes and more than a hundred Great Dao Sages attacked together. Their aura caused the nearby void to constantly collapse. Layers of alternate space bloomed like hundreds of flowers, causing the battlefield to become dazzling.

Han Jue sighed when he saw this.

The Chaos had developed too quickly in the past hundred million years. It was unknown if it was because the Ninth Chaos was about to break through or because of his influence.

!!

Be it the Great Dao Supremes or the Great Dao Sages, the number far exceeded the past eras. Thinking about it carefully, it was all thanks to the Ultimate God of Punishment. He protected the geniuses extremely well and declared that he wouldn’t kill them. In ordinary battles, even if they died, the mighty figures had ways to protect themselves and revive. They were afraid that their mortal enemies would not let them go. The Ultimate God of Punishment’s rule made it so that even if the geniuses died, they could revive.

The survival rate of geniuses was high. With time, the number of Great Dao Sages and Great Dao Supremes would naturally increase.

In the past, the Great Dao Sages and the Great Dao Supremes were not top-notch talents. They were all people with brilliant methods and great opportunities. It was just like obtaining the door of the Great Dao that the Great Dao Sages needed to cross. In the past, mighty figures deliberately obstructed Divine Lord Peacock.

At that time, no matter how talented he was, it would be impossible for him to break through if he was troubled by a mighty figure.

“Li Daokong is really powerful now. I used to think that he was very strong. Now, he has finally grown up. Unfortunately, he no longer belongs to the Hidden Sect.” Xing Hongxuan sighed.

Chang Yue’er smiled. “Not necessarily. I heard that Li Daokong has killed countless living beings, but he has never touched any Hidden Sect disciple. The entire Life faction is like this. It must be his credit.”

The women looked at Han Jue.

Han Jue smiled and said, “Perhaps he still has the Hidden Sect in his heart, but only he knows.”

Seeing his tone and smile, the women guessed that he was still related to Li Daokong, but they

did not say it clearly.

They were no longer the mortals of the past. The higher their cultivation level, the more afraid they were. Sometimes, as long as they spoke, even if there was no one nearby, they could be deduced.

Li Daokong was not Han Huang’s match. Later, he used the Sword World, a Great Dao World formed by countless forms of swords. The sword might was vast and mighty, causing the swords of the Chaotic Heavens to tremble as if

they were worshiping the Sword Ancestor.

“Li Daokong, your sword is stronger than Laozi’s!”

Han Huang laughed. He was extremely happy

to see Li Daokong. He had received Li Daokong’s help several times when he wandered the Chaos and had a favorable

impression of him.

Li Daokong stepped on the sword light that was a hundred million kilometers long and looked at the insufferably arrogant Primordial Fiendcelestial figure. He sighed and smiled. “Han Huang, you’re really strong. As expected of the son of that existence. But in today’s battle, the Calamity Life Controllers and I won’t

stop.”

“I understand. Come, I’m willing to accept the challenge of all living beings. I won’t be

qualified to become a Primordial Fiendcelestial if I’m defeated. The Primordial Fiendcelestial should be an existence that suppresses

everything!”

Han Huang’s laughter was extremely impudent. It echoed in the Chaotic Void and

spread extremely far.

The spectators in the distance were all

convinced.

“Indeed. If he’s not the Primordial

Fiendcelestial, who in the Chaos,

Transcendent, Consciousnessless, and Shi Tian

Great Dao World is worthy?”

“Although this fellow is arrogant, he’s indeed

extremely powerful.”

“Is there really a huge difference between the Primordial Fiendcelestial and all living

beings?”

“It’s fine if it’s Han Huang. Why do I feel that

Han Ye is also very strong? He will become the next Han Huang sooner or later.” “They’re both surnamed Han. Could Han Ye be

Han Huang’s son?”

“Junior, you’re wrong. Although they share the same origin, they’re not father and son. Han Huang is not the founder of the Han family. No matter how strong Han Huang is, he’s not the illusory Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s match.” “Han Huang is the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s son. How can the Divine Might Heavenly

Sage stop him from attaining the Dao? Besides, it’s impossible for the Divine Might Heavenly Sage to care about the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s fake reputation.” All living beings were discussing. At this point,

countless living beings had already become

Han Huang’s believers and were extremely fanatical.

Han Jue left after watching for a while, leaving

the women to continue watching the battle

excitedly.

After returning to the Daoist temple, Shan’e was also watching the battle with relish. They were just short of holding a handful of melon

seeds.

Shan’e wanted to bow upon seeing him, but Han Jue waved his hand and stopped him. “Continue watching.”

With that, Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. He closed his eyes and thought.

How should he use the Creation Heaven’s

Chosen now that he had accumulated eight attempts?

“Forget it. I’ll wait for another ten million

years. At that time, I’ll draw nine consecutive

times. Nine is the limit of the Great Dao. It will definitely bring good luck.”

Han Jue thought silently. At that time, the nine Creation Heaven’s Chosen could form a team, just like the Five Great Divine Punishers in the past. They could be nurtured to represent the

Nine Great Sages of the Divine Might Heavenly

Sage.

Han Jue looked forward to it.

It was time to add some fun to his boring cultivation years. Han Jue was a little bored after Han Ling left. As for Shan’e, he was not interesting enough. This fellow was too nervous and usually liked to torture noobs in the simulation trial, unlike Han Ling who dared to continue challenging him even if she was defeated.

…

Heavenly Court, Numinous Palace.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled as he sat on the Emperor’s throne and listened to the immortals in the hall discuss Han Huang’s reputation.

The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial was also in

the hall. He had been sent here by Han Ling for a long time. With his potential, he quickly established himself and was now the Heavenly Court’s number one prodigy.

Hearing Han Huang’s legend, the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial couldn’t help but recall the past. He didn’t know how far he was from Han Huang now.

An old immortal stood up and interrupted the

discussion. He cupped his hands at the Evil Heavenly Emperor and said, “Your Majesty, this is an era of great conflict. If the Heavenly Court continues to nurture an area without

fighting, it will definitely fall behind. The legends of the Endless Era have already spread. When the Endless Era arrives, the Chaos will

split into countless pieces. At that time, every piece will be independent. Unlike now, living beings from various domains can still interact and trade. At that time, different factions will have different providence. It’s impossible for ordinary living beings to enter rashly.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor nodded. “You’re right, but how should the Heavenly Court

fight? Should we fight for the Primordial Fiendcelestial position or territory?” The old immortal replied, “For territory. No

one in the Heavenly Court is qualified to fight for the Primordial Fiendcelestial position, and Han Huang is on good terms with the Heavenly

Court. There’s no need to dispel the friendship. Fighting for territory is the most beneficial. It’s best if it’s a nearby domain. This way, when the Chaos shatters, the various places in the Heavenly Court will be close and easier to

control.”

The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial immediately said unhappily, “Who said that the Heavenly Court can’t fight for the Primordial Fiendcelestial position?” The old immortal glanced at him and chuckled.

He did not argue, which infuriated the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial even more.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor scanned the expressions of the immortals and said slowly, “I’m related to the Transcendent Great World. I can enter it. At that time, I can obtain a domain

a hundred times larger than now. What do you

think?”

The immortals were in an uproar.

Transcendent?

Wasn’t that betraying the Chaos?
