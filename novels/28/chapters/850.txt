Chapter 852 Shaking the Chaos!

In the Universal Hall, the Sages all looked up and saw twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals attacking. All of them were ten million feet tall, as if the chaotic sky had collapsed!

Han Jue also looked up and summoned the Primordial Judgment Sword again.

The Sages were uneasy.

Yang Che asked carefully, “Has the number of Divine Authority Generals increased?”

The Divine Authority Generals’ aura was too strong. His Sage Sense burned the moment it touched them. He was so frightened that he hurriedly retracted it.

“There are indeed more.”

“Not only more, but they also doubled.”

“Why is this happening? Is there no end to

it?”

“Who is manipulating the Divine Authority Generals?”

“Why must you destroy my Heavenly Dao?”

The Sages were indignant. At this moment, they had already forgotten their fear and worry, and only felt endless worry.

......

They couldn’t help but look at Lao Dan.

Lao Dan sensed their anger and said awkwardly, “Why are you looking at me? How would I know?”

Han Jue ignored them. He fused with the 1,949 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols again and was already prepared.

He raised the Primordial Judgment Sword and pointed the tip at the top of the Universal Hall.

Han Jue suddenly used the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger when the distance was right.

Boom

Sword Qi soared into the sky and shattered it, then quickly rushed out of the Heavenly Dao. Under Han Jue’s deliberate control, the sword Qi didn’t hurt the Heavenly Dao’s foundation and quickly rushed into the darkness.

Just like before!

Absolute speed!

The twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals were still diving down. They were drowned by the sword Qi just as they saw it.

This speed had already surpassed the definition of speed and time!

The Divine Authority Generals were all destroyed!

It was still a sword!

The vast pressure of the twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals instantly vanished. The Sages were not as surprised as before. They were only happy.

Han Jue felt uneasy.

Would they come again?

How could that be?!

With a thought, his will instantly jumped out of the Chaos. He looked down at the Chaos and said, “Ten thousand Divine Authority Generals are not enough for me to kill with a single strike. Twenty thousand is still not enough. Will you send a hundred thousand next? A million? Or ten million?

“Is this the so-called Chaotic Rule? Why is there such a despicable act? The Heavenly Dao should exist. No matter who is behind the Divine Authority Generals, they can come and destroy the Heavenly Dao! I want to see if it’s enough to withstand a single strike from me?”

His voice spread throughout the Chaos!

He did it on purpose. Other than the Heavenly Dao lifeforms, all the living beings in the Chaos could hear his voice.

For a time, the entire Chaos fell into an uproar. Countless living beings were curious about who the voice belonged to. The cultivators who had surpassed the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit were shocked.

They all knew that the Divine Authority was about to attack the Heavenly Dao, but from Han Jue’s words, ten thousand Divine Authority Generals had already been destroyed?

No!

Twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals were killed by a mysterious mighty figure of the Heavenly Dao?

Impossible!

In the Universal Hall.

The Sages cheered when they heard what Han Jue said.

Even the usually low-profile Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was the same. He clenched his fists and shouted, “That’s how it should be! Force out the mysterious existence hiding behind them! What’s with this behavior? After ten thousand, there will be twenty thousand. Is this still a rule? Can the rules change at any time?

“Besides, what’s wrong with the Heavenly Dao?”

Actually, the Sages could not understand either.

Why did the Divine Authority Generals want to clean up the Chaotic Fiendcelestials?

Who didn’t know that the Chaotic Fiendcelestials were born after the birth of the Chaos? They were equivalent to Chaos children, and the Great Dao Divine Spirits were only the rules of the Chaos. The rules wanted to kill the family’s children?

It was unreasonable!

It didn’t make sense!

Lao Dan looked at Han Jue and sighed slightly.

He didn’t understand what the other party was thinking

These words expressed disdain for the Divine Authority and also offended the existence behind it.

It was not pleasing.

Now, he could completely endure and block the attack of the Divine Authority Generals. The existence behind the Divine Authority Generals had suffered in silence. It was fine, and as time passed, these things would quickly be forgotten.

Why fall out with them?

It was understandable for them to fall out with each other at the same cultivation level, but how could they survive in the Chaos in the future if they fell out with the existence who controlled the Supreme Rules?

Han Jue waited patiently.

Han Jue would be convinced if the number of Divine Authority Generals continued to increase until he couldn’t defeat them.

You can destroy the Heavenly Dao if you want!

I’ll cultivate in the Dao Field for a hundred million years and then come out to slaughter all of you after becoming a Dao Creator!

Taking revenge could also fulfill the Heavenly Dao’s last wish!

Han Jue was already prepared for the worst!

At this moment, a cold voice sounded in Han Jue’s mind.

“You’re the Primordial Fiendcelestial?”

Han Jue could sense that the other party was a Great Dao Supreme. He immediately searched for the other party’s voice and sent a voice transmission, “I’m a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. But go ahead if you want to call me the Primordial Fiendcelestial. In any case, the Heavenly Dao is innocent and justice is in the hearts of the people. You can destroy the Heavenly Dao, but you can’t destroy everyone’s ambitions!”

The other party did not reply.

Han Jue immediately sat down upon seeing that the Divine Authority Generals did not appear again.

Seeing this, the other Sages also sat down.

The entire Universal Hall fell silent for a time.

The Sages stared at Han Jue. They all understood the consequences of his words, but they didn’t blame him and chose to trust him.

They believed that Han Jue could support them!

At this moment, the mysterious voice sounded in Han Jue’s mind again.

“How can a Chaotic Fiendcelestial kill twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals? Even Pangu can’t do it!”

“Why can’t I? Then, why can you control the Divine Authority Generals?”

“I can’t deduce your background.”

“I don’t know who you are, either!”

“You’ll be a threat to the Chaos if you are a Primordial Fiendcelestial. Perhaps I might be wrong, but would you let go of a possibility if it were you?”

“Who said the Primordial Fiendcelestial will harm the Chaos? Even if that’s the case, what about the Divine Authority Generals slaughtering the Chaotic Fiendcelestials? Isn’t it all thanks to the Chaotic Fiendcelestials that the Chaos can be where it is today? If not for the Chaotic Fiendcelestials developing the Chaos, how could there be Great Dao living beings and deities? You don’t thank the Chaotic Fiendcelestials but rely on your strength to act ungratefully. Perhaps you Great Dao Divine Spirits should come to the Heavenly Dao World to learn morality and kindness!”

Han Jue faced the other party confidently.

However, he did not say anything overboard. He actually already knew who the other party was. It was the Primordial Ancestral God!

He wanted to pretend not to know and act aggrieved to make the other party let down his guard.

Then, he would personally kill the Primordial Ancestor God one day.

He couldn’t be spared with six-star Hatred Points!

After a long while…

The other party still did not answer.

The Divine Authority Generals did not appear again. Everything returned to normal.

It was as if the calamity had passed.

However, the Sages didn’t dare to let their guard down. They were all waiting for Han Jue’s answer.

Only when he personally said that the calamity had passed did they dare to completely relax.

The mysterious voice sounded in Han Jue’s mind again, “I will no longer target the Heavenly Dao as long as you can prove that you are not the Primordial Fiendcelestial!”

“How can I prove it?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Enter the Supreme Rules and be sealed by them until the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ends. You can sacrifice your freedom in exchange for the Heavenly Dao’s peace.”

Han Jue smiled when he heard this.

He almost wanted to take out the Book of Misfortune, but he couldn’t use it now.

The Chaotic Fiendcelestials cared more about the Dark Forbidden Lord than the Primordial Fiendcelestial!
