Chapter 198 Late-Stage Reincarnation True Immortal Realm, Chaotic Battle of Geniuses

“His contributions are indeed great, but he’s arrogant precisely because of that. Previously, I made him go and kill the Undying Emperor. It took a lot of effort to convince him.” The Heavenly Emperor shook his head with a bitter expression.

Han Jue didn’t know if he should believe it.

The Divine General also had a good impression of him!

It was a 3-star favorability. Before today, it was the same as the Heavenly Emperor’s favorability towards him.

Han Jue said, “At least he was nurtured by you, Your Majesty. Don’t worry. If I get stronger in the future, I won’t forget your kindness.”

Cultivate well. With me around, no one will disturb your cultivation.”

With that, the Heavenly Emperor vanished.

Han Jue quickly returned to the Connate Cave Abode.

He began to ponder the Heavenly Emperor’s intentions. Could it be that the Heavenly Emperor and the Divine General were about to clash?

He had thought that the Divine General was a trusted aide of the Heavenly Emperor, but it seemed that that was not the case.

The only trusted subordinate of the Heavenly Emperor was Di Taibai. Han Jue didn’t know anyone else for the time being.

“If there really is a traitor, I can check through the system.”

Han Jue thought silently and stopped thinking about it. He started to focus on cultivating.

When he became stronger, he wouldn’t be afraid no matter how chaotic the Heavenly Court was.

Han Jue had never thought of working for them.

He could return the favor, but there was no need to risk his life.

Survival was the most important thing.

Five years later. Han Jue opened his eyes and took out the Book of Misfortune to curse.

This was a rule he had set. Every ten years, he had to curse his enemies once to prevent anyone from thinking of settling the scores with him.

While cursing, he checked his emails.

(Your grand-disciple Murong Qi was attacked by your good friend Huang Jihao. Both sides were injured.]

(Your grand-disciple Fang Liang was attacked by your good friends Mo Fuchou and Zhou Fan. He was severely injured and in danger He comprehended a Mystical Power and successfully escaped.]

[Your grand-disciple Fang Liang comprehended the Divinity of Heaven and Earth and became a god on the spot.]

Han Jue looked down and couldn’t help but sigh. It was really exciting.

The Connate providence bearers also began to fight.

They forced each other to become stronger. Could this be the reason why the providence of the Scarlet Cloud World had increased so much?

Han Jue didn’t want to interfere in the chaotic battle between Mo Fuchou, Zhou Fan, Murong Qi, and Fang Liang. Even if someone died, with their providence, they might be stronger when they reincarnated.

Several months later.

Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and took out the Heavenly Dao Token to check the Heavenly Dao Tablet’s ranking.

Then, he discovered that the Scarlet Cloud World’s ranking had soared again!

It was already at the 3012th place!

Ridiculous!

Han Jue hurriedly observed the Scarlet Cloud World and then was shocked.

Many experts actually appeared in the world. Although Murong Qi, Fang Liang, Mo Fuchou, Zhou Fan, and Huang Jihao were strong, they were still far from being the number one in the world. Among the five of them, only Murong Qi, Mo Fuchou, and Huang Jihao were ranked above 90.

The cultivators above were mostly from the various Holy Lands. There were nearly twenty people from the Heavenly Immortal Manor on the list.

After Ji Xianshen left, the Heavenly Immortal Manor did not decline. Instead, it became even more prosperous.

Han Jue observed for a few days. After confirming that there were no devils or demons, he was relieved.

“Forget it.”

Han Jue sighed in his heart. He couldn’t stop those geniuses from cultivating. That would go against his role. He could only pray that the luck of the Scarlet Cloud World would grow slower.

Twenty years later.

Han Jue finally broke through to the late stage of the Reincarnation True Immortal Realm.

He was already close to the Mystic Immortal Realm!

Han Jue checked Long Shan. He was only at the mid-stage Grand Unity True Immortal Realm.

You want to enter the Golden Immortal Realm before me? How dare you?

Han Jue cursed in his heart and continued to consolidate his cultivation.

Two months later, he walked out of the cave abode and gathered everyone under the Fusang Tree. Chang Yue’er, Fairy Xi Xuan, and Xing Hongxuan were also called over.

He prepared to preach the Dao to everyone and increase their cultivation.

To mortals, the preaching of an immortal was a huge opportunity. Han Jue used his Dao voice to let everyone quickly enter a state of enlightenment. During this process, the cultivation questions that everyone found difficult to understand in the past were directly resolved. It was very magical.

After a year, Han Jue ended the lecture and started to ask them questions.

In just a short year, everyone’s cultivation levels increased.

This was true even for the two Golden Crows who had stepped into the Loose Immortal Realm.

The most obvious was Zhou Mingyue. It was mainly because his cultivation realm was low. After Han Jue’s lecture, his talent was completely unlocked.

Another half a year passed before Han Jue stood up.

Xing Hongxuan suddenly caught up to him and smiled. “Husband, I want to talk to you for a while. Let’s go in.”

Chang Yue’er frowned.

Fairy Xi Xuan left.

Dao Comprehension Sword was also a little unhappy, but she didn’t dare to make a sound.

Tu Ling’er looked at Xing Hongxuan enviously. The others pretended not to hear and continued cultivating.

Han Jue couldn’t reject Xing Hongxuan, so he brought her into the cave abode and let Dao Comprehension Sword wait outside.

“Should I be more proactive?” Chang Yue’er thought silently.

Her eyes were firm. She decided to find Han Jue again after some time and force herself on him.

As soon as she entered the cave abode, Xing Hongxuan leaned towards Han Jue like a snake.

“Husband, why have you become even more handsome recently? I really like you!” Xing Hongxuan said in an extremely sweet voice, causing Han Jue to have goosebumps. This woman was becoming more and more seductive!

Han Jue ridiculed in his heart, but he still obediently took off his clothes.

It was good to release it occasionally.

This would prevent something from going wrong with his state of mind.

Heavenly Court, North Heavenly Gate.

Ji Xianshen stood in silver armor, surrounded by more than ten Heavenly Soldiers.

As a low-grade prodigy, Ji Xianshen was arranged to guard the Four Heavenly Gates every once in a while.

Ji Xianshen was expressionless. His thoughts had long flown outside the Heavenly Court.

“The battle last time made me gain a deep understanding. As expected, I still have to fight. I can’t always cultivate in seclusion,” Ji Xianshen thought silently, deciding to find a few Heavenly Generals to sweep the Demon Region next time. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At this moment, a few immortals flew over. Ji Xianshen and the Heavenly Troops bowed. “Have you heard? His Majesty invited the Divine Palace for this Heavenly Peach Banquet.”

“If the Buddhists and the Demon Court join forces, the Heavenly Court naturally has to rope in the Divine Palace.”

“It’s said that the Divine Palace’s prodigy is coming.” “Who? The reincarnated Immortal Emperor?”

“How is that possible! It’s another prodigy, the Sword God Emperor.”

“Looks like the Heavenly Peach Banquet isn’t that simple.”

Hearing the discussions, Ji Xianshen narrowed his eyes.

He had been in the Heavenly Court for some time and knew about the Divine Palace.

There might not be as many cultivators in the Divine Palace as in the Heavenly Court, but they had the most geniuses, Immortal Emperors, and Great Emperors.

“It’s impossible for the two factions to just chat. They will definitely spar and fight in the dark. If I can defeat the Sword God Emperor, won’t I be able to soar into the sky?” Ji Xianshen thought silently as his eyes lit up.

He was only a low-grade Heavenly General and didn’t know much about the cultivation realm of the Immortal World. He didn’t know how strong the Sword God Emperor was.

However, since he was just a prodigy, it meant that he had yet to mature!
