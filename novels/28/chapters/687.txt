Chapter 690 Chaotic Consciousness, Unspeakable Name

“What’s the hurry?!” Before Di Jiang could speak, an extremely sinister Ancestral Magus beside him said coldly. His gaze was also cold like two knives, scaring the Blazing Flame Ancestral Magus into hurriedly shutting up. The other Ancestral Magi did not speak. They were all waiting for Di Jiang to speak.

Di Jiang slowly turned around and opened his eyes. His sharp gaze swept across the Ancestral Magi. “The revival of the Magus Race this time cannot happen again. We will no longer fight for the Immortal World!” Di Jiang said slowly. As soon as he finished speaking, the Ancestral Magi were moved. The Blazing Flame Magus said angrily, “How can we not fight? We have to at least kill all the demons!”

In the Immeasurable Calamity back then, the mortal enemy of the Magi was the demons. One controlled the land and the other controlled the sky. After both sides were injured, it gave the humans a chance to rise.

Empress Houtu said, “There are no more demons in the Immortal World.”

The Ancestral Magi looked at her in surprise.

Empress Houtu sighed and told the Ancestral Magi about the changes in the Immortal World. Knowing that the Immortal World was already peaceful and the Sages were harmonious, the Ancestral Magi looked at each other. What a golden age! Di Jiang sighed. “This Han Jue is impressive. Even if his cultivation is outstanding, he isn’t blinded by greed and still maintains his cultivation heart.

This is probably something that even the Dao Ancestor can’t compare to.” The Ancestral Magi nodded. They already knew that the reason why the Heavenly Dao Sages were united was because of Han Jue. Back when the Dao Ancestor was still around, he had turned a blind eye and indirectly encouraged the Sages to attain the Dao.

“That’s right. It’s all thanks to his care.” “Speaking of the Nether Race, we should take them back to the Magus Race.” “You’re really funny. He raised the Nether Race for hundreds of thousands of years. He has to return it to you the moment you revive?”

“No matter what, the Nether Race is still the bloodline of our Magus Race.” “What about the Nether Race’s own thoughts? If they know that their ancestor has revived, won’t they have the intention to return?” Hearing her brothers’ words, Empress Houtu smiled bitterly. She had already entrusted the Nether Race to Han Jue back then. How could she have the face to ask for it back?

Besides, she felt that the Nether Race might not have feelings for the Magus Race. Back when the Nether Race went to the Heavenly Race, she had tried to contact them, but she had been rejected. The Nether Race only recognized Han Jue. Empress Houtu said, “Don’t think about the Nether Race. Let’s think about where to stay next.”

Di Jiang pondered and said, “I can’t stay in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. It’s better to go to the depths of the Chaos and establish a new Heavenly Dao. I’m prepared to imitate Father and transform into all things.”

Hearing that, Ancestral Magi began to wonder if this method would work.

Five thousand years passed.

Han Jue ended his seclusion again.

He had benefited greatly from comprehending the Great Dao.

While comprehending the Dao, Han Jue saw Divine Lord Peacock and Guan Bubai.

There was a door in the Great Dao Realm. When Han Jue arrived at the door, he saw that it blocked many experts. Among them were Divine Lord Peacock and Guan Bubai. Some of them had firm expressions, some were unwilling, and some showed despair.

Even transcendent existences that stood above all living beings were like mortals in front of the Great Dao, revealing all kinds of things in the world. Behind the door of the Great Dao, Han Jue also saw many figures. They were all Great Dao Sages and Great Dao Divine Spirits.

He saw some familiar faces among them.

For example, Undying Dao, Li Muyi, the Chaotic Deity, Ancestor Xitian, and so on. Han Jue was shocked when he saw Li Muyi. He didn’t expect this fellow to also be a Great Dao Sage. What had he encountered that caused his realm to decline?

He naturally would not ask Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. Li Muyi’s death was definitely an irreconcilable barrier between him and the Human School. Perhaps one day, he would settle scores with him.

The Sage Realm was a natural chasm, but which major realm after that was not more difficult to cross!

Han Jue opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief. “Looks like I can’t keep a low profile. Once I attain the Great Dao, I will definitely be discovered.”

Han Jue thought silently. If he could see the door of the Great Dao, so could the other experts.

Of course, this was nothing.

In any case, the Sages in the Heavenly Dao did not know that their cultivation levels were too low and they couldn’t come into contact with the Great Dao Gate.

As for letting the Great Dao Sages know, that was even better. It would intimidate them and make them not dare to provoke the Heavenly Dao again. Han Jue habitually checked the emails.

Han Jue trembled when he saw Ancestor Xitian’s miserable state. Although Ancestor Xitian could no longer kill him in the simulation trial, in his mind, he was still the standard for high-end combat strength.

Who could actually easily suppress Ancestor Xitian!

Han Jue was very curious. He immediately used the derivation function.

‘[1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

1 quadrillion years!

Han Jue was shocked. This was not a curse. The value of a Great Dao Sage was only 150 billion years of lifespan. How many times had it increased? This was the first time Han Jue was involved in such an existence. He felt inexplicably nervous.

What was there to be afraid of!

He was in the Dao Field. Even a Dao Creator couldn’t spy on the situation inside! Continue!

When Han Jue made his choice, unlike before, no information popped up. The Daoist temple was silent.

Han Jue inexplicably felt an extremely strong pressure, making him feel suffocated. How many years had it been? He had almost forgotten this feeling. Han Jue became nervous. About ten seconds later, a line of words appeared in front of him.

[Chaos Consciousness: Cultivation unknown, Chaotic Deity, Above the Great Dao, Rules and Order, Unspeakable Name.)

Han Jue saw a figure in his mind. It was like a mist that could dissipate at any time. He couldn’t see the other party’s true appearance at all. How impressive!

Another line of words appeared in front of him.

[Unspeakable Name: Special power. Once you say the name, the other party will capture it, even the Dao Field can’t isolate it.]

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, he didn’t have the habit of muttering to himself.

This Unspeakable Name was so terrifying.

The other party could sense it just by reading his name? Han Jue thought of Ancestor Xitian again. He was suppressed by such an existence and was finished. Speaking of which, Han Jue had a good impression of Ancestor Xitian. Among the people he knew, only Ancestor Xitian matched his perfect vision of a Dao Pursuer.

He was extraordinary and had remarkable abilities. He looked silent but also had a hint of pity for all living beings. It was unknown how Ancestor Xitian had offended such an existence.

The Chaotic Consciousness should be different from the Great Dao Sage and would not covet the Heavenly Dao. He was the god of the entire Chaotic World and was even older than the Great Dao Divine Spirit. He definitely did not care if the Heavenly Dao existed or not.
