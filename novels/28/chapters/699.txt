Chapter 702 Great Change Sealing Palm

After the hundred-year lecture ended, Han Jue took out the nine Great Dao Fragments and started to comprehend the Great Dao Mystical Power.

Twenty years later, he comprehended a Great Dao Mystical Power. Great Change Sealing Palm! Using the power of the Fiendcelestial to transform into a sealing power to imprison the enemy!

It was extremely domineering!

Han Jue began the simulation trial and imprisoned Ancestor Xitian with a palm!

If it hit, the target would freeze!

It’s too powerful!

Han Jue was extremely excited. He continued the simulation trial and used his new Mystical Power to defeat Ancestor Xitian.

Two hours later, Han Jue began to improve his Sword Dao Mystical Powers. After that, he cultivated the Grand Unity Aspect.

In the blink of an eye, seventy years passed.

Han Jue had learned 150 new Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols this time. The number far exceeded the previous times!

Some powerful Great Dao also appeared among the 150 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.

For example, the Space Fiendcelestial, the Rewind Fiendcelestial, the Lone Fiendcelestial, and so on.

As the name suggested, the Space Fiendcelestial controlled the power of space. Since ancient times, there had been a legend of the three thousand Great Dao. Time was king and Space was emperor.

Of course, this was only a prejudice, but it was enough to show how powerful the Great Dao of Time and Space were.

The Rewind Fiendcelestial could reverse everything that happened. Even if he died, he could return to his previous state. It was similar to the Great Dao of Time. However, if time was erased, the Rewind Fiendcelestial could also reverse it. It could be said to be a match made in heaven with the Great Dao of Time.

The strength of the Lone Fiendcelestial was related to the number of Chaotic Fiendcelestials. The fewer Chaotic Fiendcelestials there were, the stronger he was. For this, he had to try his best to eliminate them.

Other Chaotic Fiendcelestials also had their own uses.

Currently, Han Jue already controlled 549 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols!

He entered the simulation trial and mastered his skills.

Every Great Dao Sage was not Han Jue’s match in a one-on-one battle!

He had the talent to cross realms and kill enemies. The Grand Unity Aspect and the new Great Dao Mystical Power would only widen the gap between him and his peers.

Han Jue opened his eyes and moved Li Xuan’ao in from the Hundred Peak Immortal River.

Li Xuan’ao opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that he had already arrived at Han Jue’s Daoist temple.

He had brought a group of geniuses and waited outside for more than ten years. The pressure was too great, and the geniuses were a little dissatisfied.

The personal disciples didn’t dare to disturb Han Jue. They knew that even if he was cultivating, he could also sense the situation outside. There must be a reason why he left Li Xuan’ao and the others alone.

Little did they know that Han Jue had only focused on cultivation and had indeed neglected Li Xuan’ao.

Li Xuan’ao bowed respectfully and explained his intentions. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Han Jue used his Sage Sense to scan the area. After confirming that there was nothing abnormal with the geniuses, he agreed to Li Xuan’ao’s arrangements and directly moved them in, letting Li Xuan’ao make the arrangements himself.

Li Xuan’ao thanked him excitedly and left.

He had brought thirty-seven geniuses this time. All of them had outstanding potential. A few had even awakened the Chaotic Physique and entered the Chaotic Domain.

It had been a long time since Han Jue went to the Chaotic Domain. The difference in levels was too great. It was meaningless going there.

He noticed that among this group of geniuses was Han Yu’s grand-disciple, Qin Ling.

This kid had actually reached the Rank Eight Immortal Emperor Realm!

His breakthrough speed was indeed fast!

Han Jue only glanced at Qin Ling and had no intention of opening a back door for him.

The current him was already a Great Dao Sage. The prodigies were nothing in front of him.

Which of his enemies did not have heaven-defying talent and providence to reach their current heights?

Han Jue went to the second Dao Field.

After the Spirit Qi in the main Dao Field transformed, the second Dao Field was the same. The fiendcelestials were still cultivating and Han Jue didn’t disturb them.

Guan Bubai was already at the mid-stage Pseudo-Sage Realm. After reaching the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, Han Jue would replace his Chaotic Fiendcelestial bloodline.

Great Loose Heaven was a perfected Pseudo-Sage. After becoming the Shadow Flood Fiendcelestial, he had been cultivating diligently. Han Jue could feel that he was very close to attaining the Dao with strength.

He thought for a moment and sent a voice transmission to Great Loose Heaven to let him enter the temple.

Great Loose Heaven was excited when he heard his voice.

Relying on his own strength to attain the Dao required too much time. Be it Pangu or the Dao Ancestor, both of them had spent billions of years comprehending it.

Great Loose Heaven was anxious and had long wanted to attain the Dao, so he wanted to ask Han Jue for guidance.

After entering the temple, Han Jue sized up Great Loose Heaven and was in no hurry to speak.

The atmosphere was silent.

After a long time.

Great Loose Heaven suddenly kowtowed and gritted his teeth. “Sect Master, I want to attain the Dao!”

In front of attaining the Dao, he could no longer care about his dignity!

Han Jue smiled. “With the potential of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial, you will attain the Dao sooner or later. You don’t have to be anxious.”

Great Loose Heaven was silent, but he looked unwilling.

Han Jue asked, “What do you want to do after attaining the Dao?”

Great Loose Heaven was stunned. “I want the other Sages regret it!”

A Sage had promised him a Sage position, but he had been intercepted. He would be furious every time he thought of this.

During that period of time, he could be said to be the joke of the entire Immortal World.

From Pseudo-Sages to mortals who had just ascended, everyone knew that he had been played by a Sage. Even a Pseudo-Sage wouldn’t be able to withstand such humiliation.

“Great Loose Heaven, are you cultivating for yourself or for others?” Han Jue asked casually

Great Loose Heaven replied, “Of course it’s for myself. It’s just that I can slap their faces in passing. That’s the best.”

Han Jue said meaningfully, “You want to slap the Sages in the face today, but what about the next day? True mighty figures won’t reveal their cultivation unless it’s necessary. Take me, for example. Before I attained the Dao, have you heard of me? After I attained the Dao, how many things have you heard of me? Those who love fame and fortune will only fall deeper and deeper. I stay away from trouble and cultivate in peace. I’ve already surpassed the Sages.”

Great Loose Heaven felt ashamed.

After all, he was someone who had experienced many things. He could listen to Han Jue’s lecture based on his own experience.

Of course, if it was someone with a lower cultivation level than him, he would only scoff and even fly into a rage out of humiliation.

“After you attain the Dao, I won’t let you out either. The Sage Realm might be strong in the Heavenly Dao, but it’s not enough in the Chaos. You have to cultivate here in peace in the future, understand?” Han Jue said earnestly.

Han Jue’s situation made Great Loose Heaven ashamed.

He pursued the Sage Realm, but Han Jue treated it like an ant.

“Alright, it’s time to help you attain the Dao.” Han Jue suddenly smiled.

Great Loose Heaven was stunned and then pleasantly surprised. He hurriedly kowtowed.

He thought that Han Jue was going to reject him. He didn’t expect him to really use his conscience. His respect for Han Jue instantly reached the extreme.

He had followed the right person!

Han Jue directly used the Great Dao of Extreme Origin to cover Great Loose Heaven.

After attaining the Great Dao, Han Jue’s Great Dao of Extreme Origin had already transformed. The vastness of the Dao made the Pseudo-Sage Great Loose Heaven fall into it. His soul was in an extremely sublime state.

A hundred years passed.

Han Jue ended his lecture and walked out of the Daoist temple.

Great Loose Heaven had already obtained the method to attain the Dao, but if he wanted to do it, he still needed to cultivate alone.

His eyes were filled with confidence.

He was confident that he could attain the Dao in five thousand years!
