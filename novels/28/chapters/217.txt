Chapter 219 Increase in Strength, Difference in Realm

[God Slayer Sword: Supreme-Grade Grand Unity Supreme Treasure, a fiendish treasure of the Heavenly Dao. No karma is generated when killing enemies. It can absorb the Heaven and Earth fiendish aura for its own use.)

Han Jue felt good when he saw the information about the God Slayer Sword.

He immediately took it out and started to make it recognize him as its master.

The blade of the God Slayer Sword was black and looked extremely evil. Especially the carving on the sword case, it looked like a sinister devil baring its fangs.

Han Jue put it away and continued to comprehend the Sword Dao.

He wanted to raise all his Sword Dao Mystical Powers to the Emperor Realm.

In the blink of an eye, another seven years passed.

Han Jue had already raised his strength in all aspects to his current limit. He began the simulation trial. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Di Taibai was insta-killed!

Flame Lord Emperor was insta-killed!

Against the Heavenly Emperor, Han Jue was insta-killed!

Marshal Shen Peng was insta-killed!

Crown Prince Tianze was insta-killed!

Dragon Subduing Buddha was insta-killed!

Han Jue opened his eyes. In short, he was still very satisfied.

No one below the Immortal Emperor Realm could kill him now!

However, when he thought of how he had offended the Demon Court’s Empress, he became wary.

No!

If he couldn’t defeat an Immortal Emperor, how could he be considered strong?

Han Jue took a deep breath and restrained his pride.

He took out the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone and started upgrading the Book of Misfortune.

It wasn’t suitable to upgrade the God Slayer Sword. It was a fiendish treasure that could easily devour its owner.

How good would it be to give the Book of Misfortune an upgrade? It could still continue to deal with enemies.

Han Jue liked to kill the enemy before they attacked.

He would try not to fight if he could.

Dao Comprehension Sword was curious about Han Jue’s actions.

Wasn’t that an ordinary book?

Could it be that Master was lying to her?

Han Jue ignored Dao Comprehension Sword and spent a few days successfully upgrading the Book of Misfortune.

(Your Book of Misfortune has been upgraded to an Emperor Dao Numinous Treasure.]

Han Jue was stunned when he saw it. It seemed that the Diamond Five Elements Bracelet was stronger because it was an Emperor Dao Supreme Treasure.

Emperor Dao Numinous Treasures and Emperor Dao Supreme Treasures were above supreme-grade Grand Unity Supreme Treasures.

Han Jue didn’t think too much and started cursing the enemy.

His lifespan would decrease after more than five days of consecutive cursing.

Han Jue planned to curse every enemy for five days without decreasing his lifespan.

While cursing, Han Jue opened the emails.

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by a Demon Saint and was severely injured.]

[Your good friend Di Taibai was attacked by demons] x5631 [Your grand-disciple Fang Liang was attacked by demons] x49323

[Your grand-disciple Fang Liang fought and devoured a demon soul. His bloodline has transformed.]

(Your good friend Sword God Emperor was attacked by your good friend Di Hongye and was severely injured.)

(Your good friend Zhang Guxing was attacked by the Divine Palace Immortal Emperor.)

[Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck. Daoist Dan Qing’s Dao heart has shattered and he’s lost his sanity.)

The Heavenly Court and the Demon Court were still fighting, but from the looks of it, the Heavenly Court was beginning to gain the upper hand. They weren’t attacked as many times as before.

However, the Divine Palace was in a miserable state, especially the Sword God Emperor. It was unknown how the Divine Palace had offended the Golden Crow Divine Clan.

Han Jue suddenly felt that the Golden Crow Divine Clan was no weaker than the Divine Palace. It was even slightly stronger.

“Master, Li Yao is being hunted again,” Dao Comprehension Sword suddenly said.

She sat beside the Nine Heavens Galaxy Water and turned her head to see the water surface.

Han Jue cursed and asked, “How’s the situation?”

Dao Comprehension Sword replied, “It’s alright. No one is her match.”

After so many years, Li Yao must still be growing stronger.

Han Jue didn’t ask anymore. Since Li Yao was fine, he couldn’t be bothered to care.

Dao Comprehension Sword watched with relish.

Six months later, Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and continued cultivating.

A few days later, Xing Hongxuan suddenly returned.

Han Jue told Dao Comprehension Sword to go out and stayed alone with Xing Hongxuan.

“Husband, how’s your cultivation recently?” Xing Hongxuan sat beside him and asked with a smile.

Han Jue said, “It’s alright. What about you?”

After not seeing her for so many years, Han Jue really missed her.

Xing Hongxuan chuckled. “I’ve also been well. Forget it, cut the crap. Let’s get down to business!”

The two of them started messing around.

A month later, they stopped.

After Xing Hongxuan put on her clothes, she began to describe her experiences over the years.

Although it was risky, it was still smooth sailing. Xing Hongxuan’s cultivation level was already at the Void Amalgamation Realm. She was very satisfied with her cultivation progress. “Husband, how many realms higher are you compared to me?” Xing Hongxuan asked curiously.

Han Jue muttered, “Let me count. About nine.”

Xing Hongxuan: “…”

Several days later, she left.

Xing Hongxuan also offered a treasure to him this time. Unfortunately, Han Jue didn’t think much of it and instead taught her a Mystical Power.

Life returned to normal.

Han Jue hoped that the days would be peaceful and that no one would disturb him.

It wasn’t boring to feel his cultivation level increase every day.

The disciples of the Hidden Sect couldn’t take it.

After Zhou Mingyue obtained Han Jue’s agreement, he went down the mountain to train. Tu Ling’er also began to walk the world. Xun Chang’an, Long Hao, the Three-Headed Wyrm King, the Black Hell Chicken, the two Golden Crows, Chu Shiren, and Murong Qi were still cultivating.

The Three-Headed Wyrm King looked at the Black Hell Chicken and asked, “You don’t plan to go out for a walk in your life?”

The Black Hell Chicken said disdainfully, “What’s there to do outside!”

“The Chaotic Heavenly Dog has already gone out. With your cultivation level, you shouldn’t be in danger, right?”

“No, that dog son is probably dead.” “Are you afraid?”

“Afraid of what?”

“Are you afraid of the outside world?”

The Black Hell Chicken fell silent.

The others couldn’t help but open their eyes. They didn’t expect that the usually annoying Black Hell Chicken was actually afraid of the outside world.

On careful thought, it made sense. It had never descended the mountain.

The Black Hell Chicken flew into a rage. “How can I be afraid? It’s just not time yet!” Unfortunately, no one believed it.

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned slightly.

The Black Hell Chicken was…

Having social anxiety? Could it be that he had scared it too much?

The current Black Hell Chicken was already at the Body Integration Realm and was not far from the Tribulation Transcendence Realm. With this cultivation level, it was very difficult to encounter danger in the mortal world.

After all, it had obtained many inheritances from Han Jue. It could easily defeat ordinary Tribulation Transcendence Realm cultivators.

“I’ll force it to go out when it reaches the Mahayana Realm.”

Han Jue thought silently. He now treated the entire Scarlet Cloud World as his home, so there was no big deal moving around in it.

Thirteen years later. Di Taibai came to visit. This time, he came personally.

Han Jue had no choice but to tell Dao Comprehension Sword to go out again and talk to him alone.

Di Taibai noticed the Nine Heavens Galaxy Water and the Resurrection Lily beside it.

The Resurrection Lily had already grown a lot and was beginning to produce Immortal Qi.

“This kid actually has quite a few treasures.”

Di Taibai thought silently. He didn’t ask. Everyone had their secrets.

“The Demon Court has already begun to retreat. How’s your cultivation level?” Di Taibai asked. Han Jue’s cultivation level was still stagnant at the True Immortal Realm. In Di Taibai’s opinion, this fellow had used some methods to deliberately conceal his cultivation level. It was definitely not his true cultivation level.

Han Jue hesitated and said, “It’s alright. I’m almost at the Golden Immortal Realm.”

Di Taibai sighed. “Your breakthrough speed is really fast. It won’t be long before you can join the Heavenly Court.”

Hearing this, Han Jue was even more conflicted.
