Chapter 939 Eternal Peak, It Has to BeHim

Time passed.

Peace returned to the Chaos after the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit died. As the enthusiasm of all living beings towards the Divine Might Heavenly Sage decreased, the Chaotic Assembly became a hot topic of discussion.

The Ultimate God of Punishment increased the reward for the Chaotic Assembly. Other than the Eternal Peak and the Chaotic Ten Absolutes, the rewards for the top ten thousand were very generous. It was enough to make all living beings go mad.

!!

Azure Heaven Mystic floated above the endless sea. The waves swept up with him as the center, stirring up shocking waves. It was a spectacular sight.

Behind Azure Heaven Mystic was a figure that looked like him. It was green and red and emitted great pressure.

Boom

The waves suddenly exploded and seawater bloomed in the sky. Azure Heaven Mystic opened his eyes and frowned.

“What cultivation technique is this? Something’s wrong. It doesn’t seem like the Great Dao, but it contains many Great Dao truths…” Azure Heaven Mystic muttered to himself as his eyes flickered.

At this moment, the Carefree Immortal suddenly appeared and smiled. “It’s indeed not the Great Dao, but something stronger.”

Azure Heaven Mystic’s eyes lit up. “Could it be the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority you mentioned previously?”

Carefree Immortal smiled. “That’s right. The Seven Supreme Rules represent the seven Great Dao Providence Divine Authorities. Other than the one you are cultivating, there are currently two Great Dao Providence Divine Authorities rampaging in the Chaos. One is the Divine Authority General controlled by the leader of the Divine Spirits. He represents slaughter. The other is the Calamity Life Controller of the Life faction.

“Speaking of Calamity Life Controllers, you have to pay attention to one person. The current Life Lord, Huang Zuntian. This person is also from the Heavenly Dao.”

Heavenly Dao?

Azure Heaven Mystic asked in surprise, “Huang Zuntian? There are so many capable people in my Heavenly Dao? Wait, I seem to have heard this name before.”

He thought carefully and came to a realization. “I remember now. The Life faction appeared a long time ago. Several Sages of our Heavenly Dao were captured, including Huang Zuntian.”

He clicked his tongue in wonder. The Heavenly Dao’s sense of honor had become stronger.

The strongest in the Chaos came from the Heavenly Dao. The Life Lord who controlled the Calamity Life Controllers also came from the Heavenly Dao.

“Huang Zuntian should participate in the Chaotic Assembly. He is qualified and is less than a hundred million years old. This is an important step for Life to go from the dark to the light. As long as he becomes a Great Dao Divine Spirit, Life will be able to gain a foothold. If he obtains the Eternal Peak, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage and the Ultimate God of Punishment will definitely not target him. Otherwise, who will dare to wantonly unleash their talent?” Carefree Immortal chuckled as he said with a casual tone.

Azure Heaven Mystic glared at him. “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is not a petty person!”

Carefree Immortal shook his head and laughed.

“Oh you, you trust the Divine Might Heavenly Sage so much. How can you surpass him in the future?”

“What does surpassing have to do with trust? The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is my goal. He will never become my enemy!”

“Then what if the Divine Might Heavenly Sage persecutes you?”

“Impossible!” Azure Heaven Mystic shouted firmly, secretly furious.

This fellow always tried to sow discord between him and the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.

If not for the fact that he wanted to cultivate the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority, he would have long fallen out with the Carefree Immortal.

Carefree Immortal did not say anything else. The two of them continued to discuss the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority.

The blue clouds gathered in the palace during the day.

In the most majestic Numinous Palace, Han Huang, Han Qing’er, and Jiang Jueshi stood proudly in the hall. The two rows of immortals sized them up with different expressions.

The War Buddha and the Black Heaven General stood in front and stared at them.

“Hahaha, Huang’er, you really came to see me. Qing’er, right? This is the first time I’ve seen you. From now on, you are the Divine Might Princess of the Heavenly Court. Your status is second only to me!” The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled.

Such willfulness, but no Immortal God dared to question it.

Firstly, the Evil Heavenly Emperor was very prestigious. Secondly, they could not offend him.

Han Qing’er beamed. “That’s not good,

right?”

“There’s nothing bad about it. It’s settled. Who is this prodigy?”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled and waved his hand. Then, his gaze landed on Jiang Jueshi.

Jiang Jueshi was easily ignored as he stood beside Han Huang. However, the Evil Heavenly Emperor was sharp and could tell at a glance that he was not simple.

In addition, he felt that he had seen Jiang Jueshi somewhere before.

Jiang Jueshi cupped his fists and said, “My name is Jiang Jueshi. I’m a disciple of the Heavenly Dao’s Divine Might Heavenly Sage.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor raised his eyebrows and asked, “What’s your relationship with Jiang Dugu?”

Jiang Jueshi replied, “We are brothers, but we have long lost contact. I don’t know if he’s alive.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor was enlightened. He remembered that Jiang Dugu indeed had a biological brother back then, and he had even joined the Human School because of him. However, his potential was not good and he died early.

Wait.

This fellow was only a few million years old and had no traces of reincarnation. How did he do it?

There was a secret. No wonder Han Jue liked him.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “Since you’re Han Jue’s disciple, you’re also my disciple. Stay in the Heavenly Court for a period of time. Don’t be in a hurry to leave!”

Han Huang smiled and said, “Your Majesty, we were traveling the Chaos and thought of our agreement, so we came here first.”

“Alright, alright, alright. Huang’er is really sensible. Pass down my orders. The Heavenly Peach Banquet will begin early!”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor stood up and smiled.

The immortals were in an uproar.

The Heavenly Peach Banquet was a grand event of the Heavenly Court!

It had been passed down for a long time!

The immortals looked at Han Huang and the other two with burning eyes.

Even the Evil Heavenly Emperor had to fawn on them. How could they miss it?

Just like that, Han Huang and the other two settled down in the Heavenly Court.

Han Huang was combative and quickly fought all the invincible figures in the Heavenly Court. He convinced all the immortals, especially the Heavenly Generals.

The War Buddha quickly became friends with him, like a lackey who often pestered him.

Jiang Jueshi was close to the Evil Heavenly Emperor. The two of them felt like old friends at first sight. They talked about the past and the present as if they were close friends.

Several years later.

Han Huang and Jiang Jueshi became Divine Generals on par with the War Buddha and the Black Heaven General. They each led a million Heavenly troops.

The Heavenly Court began to expand again. Han Huang and Jiang Jueshi also became famous in the next ten thousand years.

A group of meteors sat in a city in the Chaos. The city housed endless living beings. There were all sorts of merchants, as if it was a grand occasion in a mortal city, but there were not only people coming and going.

Han Jue sat in an inn and drank Chaotic Spirit Wine while listening to the cultivators at the next table talk about the Heavenly Court’s recent move.

The current Heavenly Court was also famous in the Chaos, especially with the addition of the Son of the Heavenly Sage.

Han Huang had already made a name for himself. All the cultivators who had seen him would exclaim, “He’s definitely at the peak of history!”

Han Jue was very calm upon hearing about his son’s prestige.

It was normal.

After all, he was a Primordial Fiendcelestial.

At this moment, there was a commotion outside the inn.

“Life is here!”

With that, Han Jue felt several powerful auras. They were all Great Dao Sages.

He had come here to see Li Daokong.

Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, Huang Zuntian, Ancestor Xitian, and the others were hiding here for some reason. Han Jue could deduce it, but he didn’t do that. He only felt that they were here.

At this point, the Life faction’s actions could no longer affect him.

Han Jue let them develop naturally.

This time, he wanted to give Li Daokong a chance to hide without difficulty.
