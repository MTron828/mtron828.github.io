Chapter 168 Black Fox Demon Emperor, Yang San Descends into the World

“I can understand. You geniuses are nothing compared to Ji Xianshen,” Han Jue said calmly as Tu Ling’er became depressed.

After returning to the Heavenly Immortal Manor, the name she heard the most was Ji Xianshen.

Ji Xianshen’s powerful rise made many geniuses of the manor feel pressured.

The Heavenly Immortal Manor seemed to have gone mad. They gave all the best cultivation resources to Ji Xianshen and spared no effort to nurture him, causing the treatment of the other geniuses to decrease greatly.

Although Tu Ling’er had grown up in the Heavenly Immortal Manor, she didn’t have a close relationship with her master nor any close friends. Therefore, her departure was not obstructed by the manor.

One less person, one less mouth to feed.

Han Jue looked at Tu Ling’er’s aggrieved expression and smiled. “Cultivate well. Ji Xianshen is very busy now. This is your chance to surpass him. The power in your body is not something that Ji Xianshen can compare to.”

Tu Ling’er immediately beamed.

[The Black Fox Demon Emperor has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]

A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue.

He immediately checked the information of the Black Fox Demon Emperor.

(Black Fox Demon Emperor: Eighth level of the Mahayana Realm, an emperor of the demons. He has obtained the providence of the demons and has already unified more than half of the demons in the mortal world. Because he heard your disciple Fang Liang mention you, saying that you are the number one in the world, he has developed hatred towards you and wants to defeat you before taking down the humans. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]

An eighth-level Mahayana Realm cultivator dares to challenge me?

He’s asking to get killed!

Han Jue was disdainful and couldn’t be bothered with the Demon Emperor.

As for Fang Liang, he wasn’t worried. It was impossible for the Son of Heaven and Earth to

die.

Even if he died, he would have to die in another world!

Han Jue chatted with her for a while and then asked her to leave.

After leaving the Connate Cave Abode, Tu Ling’er felt a little regretful.

“Am I not good-looking?”

Tu Ling’er walked to the Fusang Tree and took out a mirror.

Yang Tiandong glanced at her, feeling uninterested.

After all, he had cultivated the Heartless Flying Sword before!

The Three-Headed Wyrm King chuckled and asked, “Miss Tu, do you have a sweetheart?”

The Black Hell Chicken added with a smile, “Yes, up on the mountain. There are too many women who want to eat their sweetheart.”

The Chaotic Heavenly Dog asked curiously, “Who?!

The two Golden Crows also opened their eyes.

Tu Ling’er’s face reddened. She glared at the chicken and scolded. “You haven’t sparred in so many years. Do you want to fight?”

The Black Hell Chicken snorted. “Ah Da, fight her!”

Ah Da was the larger of the two Golden Crows. The other was called Xiao Er. Tu Ling’er rolled her eyes at the Black Hell Chicken and cursed. “Coward!”

“I, your Master Chicken, am a phoenix!”

“Would a phoenix call itself Master Chicken?”

“You…”

Han Jue ignored the worldly affairs and focused on cultivating.

Spring and autumn came and passed, and time went on mercilessly.

Some experienced hardships, some immersed in happiness, some ascended, and some went to the netherworld.

Many of Han Jue’s disciples and good friends also had various experiences in the mortal world.

As for him, he sat on a meditation mat and comprehended the Great Dao to increase his cultivation.

Time was forgotten.

Thirty years passed.

Han Jue finally broke through to the mid-stage of the Reincarnation Earth Immortal Realm!

With the addition of the Resurrection Lily and Nine Heavens Galaxy Water, the Immortal Qi in the cave abode kept increasing.

However, Han Jue still felt that his cultivation speed was slow. He took out the Book of Misfortune and started to do his daily missions. Six days per person, not too much, not too little. He then checked his emails.

The cultivation world was becoming more and more chaotic. Not only the cultivation world but also the Heavenly Court.

If the Heavenly Court was in chaos, it would be a good thing for Han Jue.

As long as the Heavenly Court did not have peace, they wouldn’t descend into the mortal world.

Judging by the number of times the Immortals had been attacked, this chaos would probably last for many years.

Han Jue was even more interested in the mysterious Demon Saint now.

It could make the Heavenly Court unable to do anything even after hundreds of years. It was even more capable than the Great Sage Rivaling Heaven in Journey to the West!

Han Jue cursed for half a year.

Apart from the Vermilion Bird, Yang San, and Daoist Dan Qing, he also cursed all the immortals who hated him.

After cursing all his enemies, Han Jue felt refreshed.

This is retribution for hating me!

He continued to cultivate.

More than two years passed.

Su Qi suddenly visited him.

Ever since he returned, Su Qi had been cultivating in seclusion. His cultivation level had already reached the Body Integration Realm. After his divinity awakened, his potential had also transformed.

After entering the cave abode, Su Qi knelt in front of Han Jue and bowed.

Han Jue didn’t ask Dao Comprehension Sword to leave, either. As long as the two of them didn’t interact, she wouldn’t be stained with bad luck.

“Master, I’ve been in seclusion for so many years. I feel that my cultivation isn’t enough and want to go out and train. Do you have any missions?” Su Qi asked expectantly. Han Jue didn’t reject him directly. Su Qi had been holding back for so long. He should go out and wander around. He couldn’t restrain him forever.

Han Jue suddenly thought of the Black Fox Demon Emperor who started hating him 30 years ago. “Go find the Black Fox Demon Emperor. Try to stay by his side and gain his trust. Don’t act rashly.” Han Jue smiled.

Su Qi’s eyes lit up. He immediately agreed. He didn’t ask who the Black Fox Demon Emperor was. He believed that he could find out.

Han Jue waved his hand, signaling that he could leave.

Every disciple and grand-disciple had mastered the Invocation Technique. Han Jue wasn’t afraid that something would happen to Su Qi.

Su Qi was an existence who was even harder to kill than Fang Liang! After he left, Dao Comprehension Sword asked, “Who is the Black Fox Demon Emperor?” “You want to go too?”

“I’ll only go if Master wants me to.”

“Forget it. You’re so weak. Don’t let the Black Fox Demon Emperor capture you and make you his concubine.”

“Hmph. Then, I’ll stay by Master’s side and cultivate. Sooner or later, I’ll be stronger than the Black Fox Demon Emperor. At that time, I’ll skin him and make a piece of clothing for Master!”

“With such strong killing intent, you won’t achieve anything in life.”

“Huh?”

Han Jue closed his eyes and went back to cultivation.

Dao Comprehension Sword curled her lips. Although she looked aggrieved, there was a smile in her eyes.

Inside a palace. Wearing silver armor, Yang San was meditating and cultivating when his expression suddenly changed. He suddenly opened his eyes and gritted his teeth. “No! I can’t take it anymore!”

He stood up and looked at the sky outside the hall.

“General, what can’t you hold back?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

A wisp of green smoke emerged from the oil lamp beside him and condensed into the figure of a beautiful woman. She floated in the air and stared at Yang San gently.

Yang San clenched his fists and said in a low voice, “The battle between the Heavenly Court and that Demon Saint is still ongoing. There’s no end to it. Now, I’m constantly reminded of Junior Sister dying every day while cultivating. In addition, there’s a curse pestering me. It’s most likely related to that brat in the mortal world. I’m going to descend into the mortal world and kill him now!”

The woman frowned. “With the heavenly rules, your cultivation level will be suppressed to the Loose Immortal Realm. It’s very dangerous.”

Yang San’s eyes flickered. “I can ask an Immortal God for a Heavenly Dao Stone.” “No, this is against the rules!”

“I just need to act quickly. Kill him and then come back!”

“But…”

“Don’t worry. I’m a late-stage Grand Unity Earth Immortal Realm cultivator. How can I not be a match for a Loose Immortal? How many years has it been? Could it be that he has also broken through to the Earth Immortal Realm? Do you think that’s possible?”

“It’s impossible, but it’s not good to break the rules. The Heavenly Emperor is very sensitive to this.”

“I’ve made up my mind!”
