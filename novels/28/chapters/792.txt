Chapter 795 Competition of the Hidden Sect

“Thank you, Master! I will definitely protect the Heavenly Dao even if I have to die!” Pan Xin took the Killing Dao Token and said excitedly.

He began to kowtow.

The Freedom Slaughter Supreme Treasure was a Supreme Treasure that was difficult to find even in the Chaos. To him, a Freedom Sage, it was definitely enough!

Han Jue patted his shoulder and said earnestly, “Life is too mysterious. Without the confidence to overturn them, it’s very difficult for the Heavenly Dao to do anything to them. You have to understand this. The current Heavenly Dao looks powerful, but you should know what the Heavenly Dao before the calamity was like.”

Pan Xin nodded heavily. “I understand. I won’t pester Life anymore.”

Han Jue said, “Of course, if anyone dares to harm the Heavenly Dao, kill them if you’re confident!”

“Alright!”

Pan Xin was very excited. He touched the Killing Dao Token lovingly after Han Jue left.

He could sense the power contained in the token. The killing intent was very strong. Perhaps it was not as domineering as the Heaven-Opening Axe, but it was not that far off.

Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple in the Hundred Peak Immortal River and teleported to the second Dao Field. He released the nurtured Killing Intent Fiendcelestial and let Murong Qi receive him.

Murong Qi was very happy. He finally had a new companion.

As the Fiendcelestials became stronger, he was already looking forward to the scene of the Fiendcelestial Army rampaging through the Chaos.

Dao Comprehension Sword looked at Han Jue and asked after the two of them left, “Master, when are you planning to let us enter the Myriad Worlds Projection again? We promise not to leak the secret. We just want to communicate with the outside world.”

Han Jue hesitated for a moment but still nodded.

He believed that Murong Qi, Han Ming, and the others would not tell anyone. Besides, his personal disciples would become Chaotic Fiendcelestials in the future. There was no need to hide it too deeply.

It was mainly because Han Jue’s Dao Field was already invincible. He would not be afraid even if the Fiendcelestial Army was exposed!

With a thought, Han Jue pulled the personal disciples of the second Dao Field into the Myriad Worlds Projection. As for the Chaotic Fiendcelestials he created, he didn’t let them in for the time being.

He sent a voice transmission to every personal disciple in the second Dao Field, strictly forbidding them from telling anyone anything about the Fiendcelestial Army. They would be severely punished once they were discovered. After doing all of this, he returned to the main Dao Field to cultivate.

In the Myriad Worlds Projection.

Dao Comprehension Sword, Murong Qi, Li Yao, Great Loose Heaven, Han Ming, Yang Du, Guan Bubai, and the crimson fox appeared.

The crimson fox, Great Loose Heaven, Han Ming, Yang Du, and Guan Bubai were very curious about the Myriad Worlds Projection. Fortunately, Murong Qi introduced it to them.

The Myriad Worlds Projection was not big. It was equivalent to a dark palace, and it only provided them with information.

“The missing people have returned!” the Black Hell Chicken suddenly shouted, startling the other personal disciples in the Myriad Worlds Projection.

Everyone gathered around and asked where they had gone.

Murong Qi and the others only said that it was arranged by Master. It was confidential and could not be disclosed.

Upon hearing that it involved Han Jue, the personal disciples didn’t dare to ask anymore.

Zhao Xuanyuan walked over and said smugly, “Brothers, do you know that the three of us just broke through recently?”

Murong Qi asked curiously, “What realm?”

“Mid-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm!”

“So terrifying?” Murong Qi exclaimed, but he wanted to laugh in his mind.

I’m already at the late-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm!

He wasn’t the only one. The crimson fox and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial had also reached the late-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.

Zhou Fan suddenly appeared and smiled. “You dare to pretend in the mid-stage? I’m already at the perfected realm!”

Jiang Yi snorted. “What are you pretending for? Without the Great Dao Tower, whether you can attain the Dao is another matter.”

Zhou Fan said proudly, “Then, why don’t you have a Great Dao Tower?”

“Hehe.”

“There’s nothing good about the Great Dao Tower. It can only defend, smash people, and help with cultivation.”

More and more personal disciples entered the Myriad Worlds Projection. Things became lively for a time.

Fang Liang also appeared.

The moment he saw Fang Liang, Murong Qi immediately went up. The two of them had an extremely good relationship in the past, and it was the same now. They felt extremely close after not seeing each other for many years.

They couldn’t sense each other’s aura in the Myriad Worlds Projection, so they didn’t know their cultivation.

The brothers walked to the side and chatted.

Guan Bubai said proudly, “You guys should hurry up and cultivate. Don’t be left behind by

us!”

Everyone looked at him.

Murong Qi glared at him and sent a voice transmission, “Do you want to anger Grandmaster? This space was created by him! Your every move is in his eyes!”

Guan Bubai was stunned.

The Black Hell Chicken came over and asked, “Are you cultivating quickly by following Master?”

Guan Bubai muttered, “It’s alright. It’s equivalent to having several Great Dao Towers.”

He did not understand what the Great Dao Tower was, but he couldn’t stand Zhou Fan’s posturing. His words infuriated Zhou Fan, but he was more surprised.

For a time, the personal disciples were stirred by the conversation in the Myriad Worlds Projection.

In the Dark Forbidden Zone, a huge palm quickly moved forward. The palm faced up, and white bones could be seen at the end.

The twelve Ancestral Magi stood on the palm with hundreds of Grand Magi. The Ancestral Magi were Houtu, Di Jiang, Goumang, Zhurong, Rushou, Gonggong, Xuanming, Qiang Liang, Zhu Jiuyin, Tian Wu, Yanzi, and She Bishi. They were formed from Pangu’s blood essence.

Empress Houtu looked at Di Jiang and asked, “Brother, are you sure Father’s will is in the Heavenly Dao?”

Di Jiang said, “That should be right.”

Zhurong smiled. “We can revive Father once we find his will. At that time, our Magus Race will dominate the Chaos. Just thinking about it makes me excited!”

The other Ancestral Magi laughed, their faces filled with anticipation for a beautiful future.

Houtu said worriedly, “The current Heavenly Dao is different from before. Don’t act recklessly when you reach there. Although I have a relationship with Han Jue, that’s not enough for us to act recklessly.”

Qiang Liang snorted. “What are you afraid of? Zhu Jiuyin has already become a Great Dao Sage. Han Jue won’t fall out with us directly even if he’s not his match.”

Han Jue had shocked them in the previous Heavenly Court battle, so they didn’t dare to brag.

Di Jiang smiled. “Don’t worry, I know what to do. Besides, the Heavenly Dao was created by Father. We don’t plan to be enemies with the Heavenly Dao.”

Hearing this, the worry on Houtu’s face eased.

At this moment, a powerful aura attacked from ahead and blocked the huge palm.

The twelve Ancestral Magi immediately became vigilant and prepared to fight.

“The blood essence of Pangu, the twelve Ancestral Magi, should have been Pangu’s orthodox lineage. However, after your Father created the world, the Heavenly Dao no longer belonged to you. You have become the Sages’ pawns. How ridiculous.”

A disdainful laugh sounded as a terrifying huge face appeared in the darkness ahead, smiling sinisterly. Its pupils were hundreds of times larger than a huge palm, as if a giant was staring down at a tiny ant.

Di Jiang shouted in a low voice, “Who do you think you are? Do you want to block the way?”

The disdainful laughter sounded again. “You have been suppressed by the Heavenly Dao in the Ancient Desolate for countless years. Houtu has never been able to escape the cycle of reincarnation and has been suppressed by the Heavenly Dao Sages. Now that she has finally established herself, do you still want to turn around and curry favor with the Heavenly Dao? Don’t you think it’s ridiculous?”
