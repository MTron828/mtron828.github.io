Chapter 1041 Legend of the Dark Forbidden Lord

“Is there really someone worse than me?” Shan’e was stunned and asked in disbelief. He fell silent after Han Jue recounted Han Bashen’s experience.

“Cultivate well and find your true goal. Don’t disappoint me,” Han Jue said meaningfully. Shan’e couldn’t help but look up at him. For some reason, Shan’e felt that his smile was so holy and noble.

Compared to this progenitor, he was really too petty.

He was so petty that he wasn’t worthy of cultivating by his side.

Shan’e had already understood the Han family. They had countless descendants and had been passed down for tens of millions of years. There were definitely descendants more outstanding than him in the myriad worlds and descendants who were even more miserable than him.

Even so…

The progenitor had chosen him, Shan’e!

At this moment, indescribable emotions surged in his heart. His unwillingness and hatred dissipated.

He said seriously, “Progenitor, I will work hard and not let you down!”

Han Jue smiled. “Do you sense your own strength?”

Shan’e said, “Yes, but it’s very vague. This power seems to be the Dao of Karma you talked about. I can use it to spy on the Chaos and Yin-Yang, but I can’t make it work for me. What I’m talking about is transforming it into my combat power.”

Han Jue said, “There’s an extremely mysterious mighty figure in the Chaos. He might also be the most mysterious existence in the entire Chaos and Shi Tian. His name is the Dark Forbidden Lord. No one has seen his true body, but many mighty figures were cursed to death by him…”

He introduced the Dark Forbidden Lord from the perspective of others.

Shan’e was surprised.

Using curses to attain the Dao and shock the world?

There was such an existence?

“I’ve also been cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord, so I passed the power of karma to you. I want you to become an existence like him. In the future, when the Dark Forbidden Lord curses me, help me curse him.”

Han Jue smiled, causing Shan’e’s blood to boil.

The progenitor had given him a goal to cultivate, so he was naturally excited.

After understanding why the progenitor had taken him in, not only was he not disappointed, but he was even more grateful

to him.

The progenitor actually chose him to fight such a powerful existence. How highly

regarded was this!

Shan’e clenched his fists and said, “I’ll definitely use the power of karma to protect the progenitor and everyone!”

The so-called everyone included the descendants of the Han family and the Hidden Sect disciples. These days, Han Jue brought him to see the others, and they were very passionate and took care of him, making him feel the kinship he had not felt for a long time. He cherished this very much.

Han Jue rubbed his head, making him feel embarrassed.

Although Shan’e was almost five million years old, his mind was still stuck at the age of youth. He had been in seclusion all these years and had not gained any experience.

“You’re my most favored descendant. I believe you.” Han Jue smiled gently. Shan’e was so excited that his entire body seemed to be burning.

Then, Han Jue let him continue cultivating. After entering his cultivation state, Shan’e

quickly calmed down.

Han Jue smiled and started to check his emails.

[Your good friend Li Daokong has fused with the Sword Dao River and established the Great Dao World. His cultivation has increased

[Your good friend Holy Mother of Order has entered the Purity Great Dao World.]

…

It was still so lively.

Every email contained abundant information. Han Jue could think of a soul-stirring plot.

How interesting.

He suddenly envied these guys.

It was precisely because their cultivation speed was inferior to his that they could experience more life than him. Han Jue also wanted to act recklessly, but he had no backing.

His personal disciples and descendants at least had his support. As for him, along the way, he could only rely on the system to become stronger. He would also die if he encountered a powerful enemy that far exceeded his current realm. Therefore, he was very glad that he had chosen the right path. Not going out would reduce the chances of coming into contact with powerful enemies!

He had to keep a low profile and not attract too much attention before he grew up.

Han Jue focused on the Ultimate Origin World after reading the emails.

The Ultimate Origin World was far from the Chaos and Shi Tian. Only Great Dao Supremes could step into the blank domain. However, even Great Dao Supremes didn’t dare to enter the blank domain.

The Dao Creators did not attack the Ultimate Origin World, so it was calm. However, this was only around the Ultimate Origin World. An unprecedented conflict had

appeared in the Ultimate Origin World. As more and more living beings appeared, the Nether Race and the Chaotic Fiendcelestials preached. More and more cultivators appeared. Ambition would naturally grow as one became stronger.

Some were born evil, some were born bloodthirsty, and some began to plunder

because of the upper limit of their potential.

There were all sorts of situations, and conflicts naturally appeared.

Han Jue had no other thoughts about this. He was happy to see this. He could hand it over to the Nether Race and the Ultimate Origin Soul Race. Only after chaos could order be established.

Battles would ensue sooner or later wherever living beings were. Powerful existences needed to be weak.

He wouldn’t care as long as the Ultimate Origin World didn’t suffer any calamity. What he wanted to do was guide all living beings in the Ultimate Origin World.

Han Jue could already understand why gods didn’t care about mortal suffering. He had become such a god despised by mortals.

In an extremely bright hall.

Two rows of stone pillars that were so tall that their tops couldn’t be seen formed a

Great Dao that connected the heavens. At the end of the Great Dao, a figure sat on a

thousand-foot-tall jade throne. It was Han Ling.

Han Ling wore a golden sleeve dress and had a dignified posture. Her long hair scattered on the throne and she wore the Dragon Phoenix

Emperor Crown. She was like an ancient god who had created everything. She meditated quietly, looking dignified and holy.

At this moment, three figures suddenly appeared in the vast hall below. Han Yao, Han Ye, Han Bashen!

The three of them had terrifying auras and were domineering, like invincible war gods. Facing Han Ling, they knelt down and bowed. Han Yao said, “Your Majesty, the Supreme Rules have been stripped from Shi Tian. The various factions have gone to fight for the

Supreme Rules and want to obtain the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. I want to represent the Creation Emperor Court in this

fight!”

Han Ye snorted. “This battle concerns the Creation Emperor Court’s reputation. We still have to send the strongest Emperor General,

which is me!”

Han Bashen chuckled. “Although you are

strong, you are not as domineering as me. If you want to shock the world, you still have to

rely on my strength!”

The three of them competed openly. No one wanted to lose to each other.

Han Ling said, “All of you, go together. You must obtain the Supreme Rules. You can’t give up even if you face my second brother.” Han Ye smiled. “Ancestor Han Huang? I’ve long wanted to spar with him!” Han Yao and Han Bashen also looked expectant.

They had never seen Han Huang’s true strength, but he was indeed famous. They

could be said to be thunderous and naturally

wanted to challenge him.
