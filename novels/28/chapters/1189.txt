Chapter 1191 Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign

Han Jue continued to travel the basic rules domain. Han Liang’s current state was caused by a special basic rule. He had comprehended it just now and had a deeper understanding of the special basic rules.

The so-called special basic rules were outstanding rules among the basic rules. They also had rules elements that were not blank domains.

Han Jue thought of a way to jump out of the blank domain.

Perhaps the blank domain was everything. There was no outside at all, but the blank domain could expand. He could also create the outside and jump out of the blank domain as long as he grasped all the basic rules!

!!

Han Jue was even more determined after he found a direction.

As for reality, he was not worried about it at all. His three Dao Fields all had clones. There were still clones heading to the Origin Space-time and countless wills scattered in every corner. Now, it was impossible for the Ninth Chaos to slaughter the Hidden Sect disciples while he was breaking through.

He focused on comprehending.

Han Liang followed his grandfather curiously. He did not dare to disturb him. Gradually, he seemed to begin to see the surrounding light. It seemed like he could absorb it!

…

In the Transcendent Divine Hall.

The Dao Creators looked up angrily at the white-haired man floating in the void.

Three demon statues floated behind the white-haired man. Upon a careful look, they were somewhat similar to the three Primordial Fiendcelestials but different.

He was the white-haired man that Han Jue and the Ninth Chaos had predicted.

The Lord had been hidden for tens of billions

of years. The Endless Era had become extremely abundant. Many geniuses would appear every ten million years. The Dao Creators did not know how the white-haired man rose. When they realized the threat of this person, it was already too late.

In just ten billion years, this white-haired man had become a Dao Creator and called himself the Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign.

Before the Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign attained the Dao, he was a gentle person and was not like this. After attaining the Dao, he targeted the three Primordial Fiendcelestials and wanted to absorb them to increase his potential. In the end, he became like this. He looked like a demon, devoid of the noble aura of a Dao Creator.

“You’re really stupid. You didn’t expect there to be another world hidden above the Transcendent Divine Hall, right?”

Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign looked down at the Dao Creators and smiled

disdainfully.

They had already experienced a fierce battle

just now. All the Dao Creators combined were not the Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign’s

match.

After fusing with the three Primordial Fiendcelestials, Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign was too strong.

The Ninth Chaos said in a low voice, “I advise you to turn back. You devoured Han Huang. The Lord will definitely not let you go.”

Han Tuo, Han Ling, Li Yao, and the other Dao Creators of the Hidden Sect looked at the Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign with killing intent. It had been a long time since they felt

such powerlessness.

“Lord? I’ve never seen him since I was born. Does he really exist?”

Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign snorted. He waved his hand and a purple Qi layer appeared above the Transcendent Divine Hall, splitting the entire blank domain into two.

The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity cast a spell. Terrifying Dharmic powers erupted, but they couldn’t shake the purple Qi layer.

The other Dao Creators attacked one after another. Countless rings of light appeared in the purple Qi layer, like the sea under torrential rain. However, no matter how they attacked,

they could not break through the purple Qi

layer.

Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign looked up and reached out to tear open space before

stepping in.

The spatial crack shrank!

Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign appeared

in a huge world. The sky was blue and the

ground undulated like a mortal world. The mountains and rivers were as beautiful as a painting, but he frowned.

“Why can’t I sense the aura of rules?”

Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign was surprised. He had thought that there would be a huge opportunity hidden in this higher world.

He had searched for this world for ten billion

years and did not want to return empty-handed.

He began to search this world.

Soon, he landed in front of a stone statue. This stone statue depicted Han Jue’s appearance. Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign frowned

and reached out to touch the stone statue.

In an instant, a shadow appeared. It was a wisp of Han Jue’s will.

Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign did not retreat. Instead, he asked, “Who are you?” Han Jue smiled and asked, “What do you

think?”

“In the blank domain, the only one above the Dao Creator is the legendary Lord. Is that you?”

“Mm.”

“Very good!”

Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign smiled. He

raised his hand and grabbed at him, but his

hand directly passed through Han Jue’s will and missed.

Han Jue still smiled at him.

Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign twisted

his right hand and formed a curse seal in his palm. However, it still passed through and didn’t affect Han Jue at all.

“Looks like the Lord lives up to his reputation.” Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign snorted. He didn’t retreat and continued to stare at him.

Han Jue smiled and said, “You want to absorb my power?”

Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign said,

“That’s right. Give it to me. This blank domain remained unchanged for too long, I’m going to change it. The blank domain you guided is not

much different from the past. You gained merit by increasing the number of Great Dao Worlds, but this doesn’t affect the essence of the blank domain. I’ve comprehended the rules of the blank domain and figured out how to change it. I’m undergoing a great creation.”

Han Jue asked, “How do you want to change

it?”

Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign said, “I want to create a limited world. The Infinite World looks filled with hope, but it’s meaningless. Cultivating in order to explore the unknown is a mistake in itself. A world without cultivation is the true paradise. All living beings will be equal. They won’t kill each

other or bully each other. They can do whatever they want. There’s no limit, no life and death, no pain.”

Han Jue shook his head. “Then why did you devour the three Primordial Fiendcelestials?” “Because there must be sacrifices on this path. My potential has to surpass the Primordial Fiendcelestial and the Dao Creator. As long as I absorb you, I can break through again and

fulfill my wish. At that time, I will revive you, the Primordial Fiendcelestial, and the living beings I killed,” Life Severing Great Origin

Sovereign said seriously, his tone revealing a hint of madness. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Han Jue stared at him carefully.

Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign looked at

him calmly. After a while.

Han Jue suddenly said, “Are you afraid of

death?” Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign was

stunned. He frowned and asked, “What do you mean?”

Han Jue smiled. “You’re not a living being. You were only born through all living beings, right? I should call you the blank domain.” Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign suddenly

retreated. This was the first time he panicked. He stared at Han Jue.

Han Jue said, “You’re worried that the Ultimate

Origin World will devour the blank domain by devouring you, so you were born. However, your power is restricted by the basic rules. You can only use your will to reincarnate. You finally found an opportunity after I’ve disappeared for tens of billions of years.” Life Severing Great Origin Sovereign’s expression darkened. “You were born in the blank domain, but you want to devour it. Do you really think you’re not wrong? You’re already invincible. You already have supreme authority. Why do you still want to advance?” Han Jue smiled. “I’m like you. I’m also afraid of death. I’m afraid that this blank domain will devour me, just like the Primordial Fiendcelestial and the Ninth Chaos in the past. Although I’m becoming stronger, the blank is also becoming stronger. All living beings are only pawns in your eyes, right?”
