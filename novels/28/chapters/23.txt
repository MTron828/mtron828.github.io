Chapter 24: Golden Core Realm, Qilin Sword

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

No matter how Mo Fuchou and Zhou Fan tried to persuade him, Han Jue would not give in.

The two could only leave helplessly.

After leaving the cave abode, the two flew for a distance.

Zhou Fan couldn’t help but say, “Although he’s powerful, he’s too timid!”

He had already put it nicely. Frankly, he wanted to say that Han Jue was afraid of death.

He had heard from other disciples of Jade Serene Peak that Han Jue was good at everything, but he was too timid.

Mo Fuchou didn’t speak for Han Jue this time. He sighed and said, “One can’t only cultivate in seclusion. We’re mortals. We still have to fight for opportunities. Just wait and see, he will come to his senses sooner or later.”

Zhou Fan nodded.

He suddenly looked forward to this mission.

Once he obtained those elixirs, he might be able to surpass Han Jue!

Thinking of this, Zhou Fan was very excited.

Previously, he had been knocked out by Han Jue in the inner sect assessment. It was really traumatic. Although he didn’t hate him, he had always wanted to regain his honor.

...

[Congratulations on obtaining a Little Universe Belt]

[Little Universe Belt: It contains a large alternate space. It can be used as a storage ring or storage bag. The belt is elastic and not easily destroyed.]

Han Jue raised his eyebrows and looked at the Little Universe Belt in his hand.

The belt was like a scroll of painting, but a very narrow one. He used his divine sense to probe it. There was an alternate space of a thousand cubic meters within. It was much bigger than his storage bag.

He immediately dripped his blood on it to claim the belt.

After he succeeded, he threw everything into the Little Universe Belt and tied it around his waist.

The belt tightened around his robe. It wasn’t too tight nor too loose around his waist. Very comfortable.

Han Jue played with it for a while before resuming cultivation.

...

Two years passed in a flash.

His six spiritual powers had all reached perfection.

He was preparing to transcend the tribulation!

He activated the barrier function and underwent his tribulation in the cave abode.

Although the Heavenly Tribulation of the Golden Core realm was formidable, it was far from being able to destroy the mountain. The Heavenly Thunder would be concentrated above his head.

Apparently, the Golden Core realm’s heavenly tribulations would provoke his inner evil.

Only around three in ten Foundation Establishment realm cultivators could break through to the Golden Core realm.

They would either be struck to death by the Heavenly Tribulation or be driven mad from the inner evil.

Han Jue had a top-notch cultivation potential and practiced top techniques. He wasn’t afraid of these obstacles.

As he activated his cultivation method, dark clouds started to gather above him. Lightning began flashing.

At the same time, a voice sounded in Han Jue’s mind.

“What do you want?”

“Fame?”

“Money?”

“Women?”

“You’re already strong enough. Stop concealing yourself and show the world your strength!”

This voice was like a demon, constantly bewitching him.

Han Jue was indifferent and even wanted to laugh.

Is this the inner evil?

So lame! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As Han Jue moved his hand, the spirit energy in his body surged.

Foundation Establishment, Golden Core formation!

Spirit energy began to gather in his dantian like the center of a whirlpool in his body.

Bolts of lightning suddenly shot out from the dark clouds and landed on Han Jue’s body.

Han Jue directly used the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique to absorb the heavenly lightning.

Transcending the tribulation with six types of spiritual force was simple and smooth!

Han Jue’s thunder cultivation potential was unable to completely absorb the heavenly lightning. However, he was able to fend off the excess with other spirit energy. He didn’t feel a thing.

He soon noticed that it wasn’t his spirit energy that was doing the job, but the Golden Cicada’s Mystic Divine Robe’s effect.

This Numinous Treasure can actually help me transcend the tribulation...

Han Jue thought in surprise.

The Golden Cicada’s Mystic Divine Robe was able to withstand an attack from a Soul Formation realm cultivator. Would it also be able to help him transcend to the Nascent Soul realm in the future?

Han Jue got excited.

What a treasure!

Motivated, Han Jue continued his tribulation.

...

Seven days later.

Han Jue finally succeeded.

[Congratulations on breaking through to the Golden Core realm and obtaining an unparalleled magical sword.]

[Congratulations on obtaining the Qilin Sword.]

[Qilin Sword: A sword made from the bones of a Qilin. It contains the Qilin’s soul and has the effect of exorcising evil.]

A sword appeared in Han Jue’s hand. This sword was completely black, and the blade was embedded with Qilin scales. The hilt looked even more awesome. The blade was three fingers wide and one meter long.

Holding this sword, Han Jue’s palm felt cool.

What a cool sword!

It matched him very well!

Han Jue put the Qilin Sword away and began consolidating his Golden Core realm cultivation.

Half a month later.

He began to cultivate the third level of the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique, and at the same time, he inherited his first Mystical Power.

Six Paths Soul Absorption Technique!

As the name implied, this mystical power could absorb souls, especially wandering ghosts. After mastering it, Han Jue could also see souls that ordinary people couldn’t.

After Han Jue learned the cultivation method, he started to cultivate the mystical power.

His top-notch cultivation potential of six attributes allowed him to learn it within ten days.

As expected of a mystical power, it was much more difficult to learn than magic.

And it was obviously stronger!

Han Jue really wanted to try it on wandering ghosts, but this was the Jade Pure Sect.

He opened his attributes panel.

[Check interpersonal relationships]

...

Lifespan has increased to 499 years. Not bad!

400 years is enough for me to break through to the Nascent Soul realm!

I bet I can break through in a hundred years!

Han Jue thought proudly.

He suddenly remembered that he hadn’t bid farewell to Fairy Xi Xuan after the inner sect assessment.

I’m being rude!

Han Jue immediately stood up and left.

After leaving the cave abode, he flew to the Jade Pure Sect’s inner sect.

It was easy to find his way. The eighteen peaks were too eye-catching.

Han Jue checked his interpersonal relationships as he flew on his sword.

The Favorability and Hatred didn’t change much.

He opened the mailbox.

[Your good friend Li Qingzi was attacked by a fiendish cultivator.]

[Your good friend Li Qingzi was attacked by a fiendish cultivator.]

...

Omit ten similar messages.

...

[Your good friend Li Qingzi was attacked by a fiendish cultivator and was severely injured. He luckily escaped.]

Han Jue was stunned.

Sect Leader’s being attacked by the fiendish cultivators?

So many messages. It looks really bad!

Han Jue became nervous. Is the Cult about to launch an attack on us soon?

While thinking, Han Jue arrived at Jade Serene Peak.

He quickly came to the front of Jade Serene Hall and knelt down.

After the door opened, he got up and entered the hall.

“Junior Han, you’re finally willing to come back!”

Chang Yue’er complained.

Han Jue raised his eyebrows. Is this girl actually Fairy Xi Xuan’s relative?

Why do I bump into her every time I come here?

Chang Yue’er’s cultivation had reached the fifth level of the Foundation Establishment realm. This speed could be considered fast among ordinary people, but it was incomparable to Han Jue’s speed.

Completely incomparable!

Han Jue knelt in front of Fairy Xi Xuan and said, “Greetings to you, Master. After the inner sect assessment ended, this disciple was in a hurry to cultivate and forgot to visit you!”

Fairy Xi Xuan narrowed her eyes and asked, “You actually still remember to come back? I thought you’d already betrayed me.”

Han Jue was embarrassed.

He was about to explain when Fairy Xi Xuan continued, “The Jade Pure Sect is about to face an unprecedented disaster. I’ll give you a chance. You can leave the sect right now!”
