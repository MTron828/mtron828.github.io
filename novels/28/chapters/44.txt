Chapter 45: Innate Dao Heart, Attention from the Demon Lord

Why aren’t we running? Is this something you should say? Li Qingzi roared in his heart.

The reason why he came to find Han Jue was to let him know so that he could prepare.

He didn’t expect Han Jue to want to leave directly!

Li Qingzi said gloomily, “Where can we escape to? There are so many disciples. Even if we escape, we have to escape from the Great Yan Cultivation World. However, if we go to other cultivation worlds, those sects will definitely not let us have a foothold and will only swallow us. The Jade Pure Sect will still perish.”

Han Jue frowned.

He wanted to say that it was fine if the Jade Pure Sect perished, as long as they were still alive!

[The Jade Pure Sect is in danger of being annihilated. You have the following choices:]

[1: Immediately run away. You will be hunted down by the Raincoat Sect as you wander the world. You can obtain equipment.]

[2: Protect the sect. People only live once, you cannot retreat forever. After defeating the Raincoat Sect, you can obtain a Numinous Treasure, a sword technique manual, and an egg of a divine beast of providence.]

Han Jue didn’t make a decision immediately but thought carefully.

Even if he escaped, where could he run to?

After exterminating the Jade Pure Sect, the Raincoat Sect would definitely continue to attack and sweep through the cultivation world of the Great Yan Dynasty unless they joined them.

Join if he couldn’t win?

This was no longer keeping a low profile, it was cowardice!

Why don’t we wait and see? If we can’t beat him, we can still escape!

He wore the Golden Cicada’s Mystic Divine Robe and held the Burning Fiend Bell. With the Wind God Technique, how could he not escape?

Han Jue asked, “When will the Raincoat Sect come?”

“Ten years at most. It will take them time to clean up the mess in Maple Leaf Valley.”

Han Jue sighed and said, “Sect Master, why is our Jade Pure Sect being targeted one after another? I thought that our sect was very strong.”

Li Qingzi was embarrassed and blushed.

He gritted his teeth and said, “The Jade Pure Sect is indeed powerful, but the strongest one, who is also the founding ancestor, went to search for the path of becoming a land deity. He left for five hundred years without any news. If he was here, how would they dare to attack us? A thousand years ago, in the final battle against the Raincoat Sect, the founding ancestor was the greatest contributor!”

Han Jue raised his eyebrows. “In other words, the Raincoat Sect is seeking revenge?”

Li Qingzi nodded helplessly.

To mortals, a thousand years was extremely long, but in the cultivation world, it was not. Especially to a sect, Li Qingzi was the third generation sect master of the Jade Pure Sect and his master, the Great Grand Elder, was the second.

“The founder left behind a treasure to contact him. The Great Grand Elder and I have already used it. I wonder if the founder can sense it. If he can return, the Raincoat Sect will be nothing to worry about. At that time, we will definitely become the strongest sect in the Great Yan Cultivation World. Elder Han, we have to grit our teeth and endure this. As long as we can endure it, we won’t have any threats in the future. You can cultivate in peace. The founder might even be able to teach you the cultivation techniques from the land of immortals!”

Li Qingzi grabbed his hand and said in a serious tone.

Han Jue almost had goosebumps. He quickly pulled his hand back and sighed. “Alright, I’ll face the Raincoat Sect with you. But let me say this first. If I can’t win, I can only run.”

Li Qingzi nodded solemnly and said, “If we really can’t win, I won’t let you die with us!”

The two of them chatted for a while more before Li Qingzi left.

Han Jue wanted to ask him to take some pills to help him increase his cultivation, but Li Qingzi awkwardly said that the Jade Pure Sect did not have any pills suitable for Nascent Soul realm cultivation.

The Jade Pure Sect lacked alchemists!

Han Jue turned to look at the Black Hell Chicken and said, “Do you see? It’s really dangerous. Even if we don’t cause trouble, there are enemies who want to kill us everywhere.”

The Black Hell Chicken nodded like a chicken pecking at rice.

“Master, are you confident?”

“No.”

“Ah! Shall we run quietly?”

“Hmm? Not bad, you’ve already received my teachings!”

“Really?”

“We’ll wait for a while.”

...

That day, Han Jue came to the inner sect and bought a beast-taming bag.

It was convenient to bring the Black Hell Chicken along like this.

After leaving the pavilion, just as he was about to return, a line of words suddenly appeared before his eyes.

[Detected bearer of Connate providence, checking its origin.]

Another bearer of Connate providence?

The Jade Pure Sect was truly a providence magnet!

Han Jue immediately chose to check.

[Xuan Qingjun: Third level of the Foundation Establishment realm. Her true identity is the Demon Lord’s mortal body. She was born with an Innate Dao Heart and is extremely talented. 800 years ago, the Demon Lord wanted to surpass the Dao and ascend. Therefore, she created a mortal body. The main body is sealed in the depths of the essence soul. The mortal body travels the world and experiences the various aspects of life, consolidating the Dao Heart. There are traces of her everywhere in the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths. Three years ago, she joined the Jade Pure Sect and has been hiding there since.]

Demon Lord...

That was impressive.

She had an Innate Dao Heart even as a demon?

What kind of reverse cliché was this?

Han Jue was speechless.

He followed the system’s instructions and saw Xuan Qingjun.

This woman wore the Daoist robe of the Jade Pure Sect. Her figure was average and she was not outstandingly beautiful from the back. When she turned her head, Han Jue assessed her.

Her looks were average.

She was a very ordinary female disciple. If one scanned the streets, they would easily pass her by without noticing her.

Xuan Qingjun stood by the street, watching people argue.

Two male disciples fought over a beautiful female disciple.

“Should I seduce the Demon Lord? She’s about to ascend and is at least a Mahayana cultivator.”

Han Jue thought silently.

Then, he shook his head.

Forget it.

He wanted to avoid trouble.

Han Jue turned around and left.

At this time, he didn’t notice Xuan Qingjun glancing at him.

[Xuan Qingjun has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 1 star.]

Han Jue paused, his face full of question marks.

What the hell?

He turned around and met Xuan Qingjun’s gaze.

Crap!

The Demon Lord was paying attention to him!

Han Jue panicked for some reason and smiled politely at her.

[Xuan Qingjun’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 2 stars] 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Han Jue hurriedly left.

Xuan Qingjun turned around and followed him.

After leaving the inner sect city, Han Jue immediately used the Wind God Technique and returned quickly.

After returning to the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue sat on the bed in a panic.

“I hope she just thinks I’m pretty and doesn’t really have her eyes on me.”

Han Jue thought silently.

He wasn’t stupid.

Even if Xuan Qingjun liked him, he wouldn’t have a better life.

After all, she was the Demon Lord. How many years had she been roaming the mortal world?

How could she fall in love with someone at first sight and give up everything?

If Han Jue tried to please her, there would only be one outcome.

Slavery!

...

Xuan Qingjun came to the cave abode and saw the words on the mountain wall.

“Endure Today, Freedom Tomorrow!”

She tried not to laugh.

This kid is interesting.

Xuan Qingjun smiled. But then, her expression suddenly turned serious. “These words make sense...”

Xuan Qingjun thought for a moment and left.

After she left, Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

“I hope she’ll give up the desire for me,” Han Jue muttered to himself.

The Black Hell Chicken asked, “What desire?”

Han Jue said angrily, “My desire to eat you!”

“Ah! That woman wanted to eat you, Master?”

In other words, was that woman stronger than Han Jue?

Han Jue had a strange expression and said, “In a sense, yes.”
