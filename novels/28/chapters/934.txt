Chapter 936 Carefree Immortal, Dominating the Chaos

“The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is already the strongest in the Chaos. It’s impossible to surpass him without a huge opportunity.”

The mysterious voice entered Azure Heaven Mystic’s ears again.

Azure Heaven Mystic seemed to sense something and suddenly turned around. He saw a figure walking over from the horizon. Lotus flowers bloomed under his feet as he walked leisurely.

This figure was formed like the wind. It was difficult to see its true appearance. It was mysterious and unfathomable.

“Who are you? Tell me your name!” Azure Heaven Mystic shouted in a low voice, his heart burning with anger.

This person definitely wanted to sow discord between him and the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.

He wanted to be on par with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. He only wanted to catch up, he did not hate him.

He was a Heavenly Dao Sage. How could people from the Heavenly Dao kill each other?

“I am the Carefree Immortal who travels the Chaos to find the Great Creation. Your potential is already top-notch in the Chaos. You are even more outstanding than the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. Unfortunately, there are only seven types of Great Creation in the Chaos. If you can’t obtain one, you won’t be able to surpass the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.”

He chuckled. His tone was ethereal and unfathomable.

Azure Heaven Mystic frowned and asked, “What seven?”

Carefree Immortal?

He had never heard of him.

However, the other party’s words interested

him.

“There are seven Supreme Rules above the three thousand Great Dao. The previous Divine Authority General who ruled the Chaos was one of the Seven Supreme Rules. It was also called the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit forcefully devoured a Supreme Rule and could have fought with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. However, he suffered a backlash from the Supreme Rule and finally fell into eternal damnation,” Carefree Immortal said slowly, impressing Azure Heaven Mystic.

This person is definitely not simple!

Definitely stronger than me!

It was very difficult to escape. It was better to learn more about the Chaos from him.

Azure Heaven Mystic thought silently and continued asking questions.

The battle between the Divine Might Heavenly Sage and the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit caused a long-lasting discussion in the Chaos.

A hundred thousand years later, all the living beings in the Chaos were still discussing this battle. However, this battle had already become a legend. The junior cultivators had all heard such legends as they stepped into the path of cultivation.

Inside the Daoist temple.

Han Jue opened his eyes. The Ultimate God of Punishment had yet to be successfully enslaved. He had no choice but to release the million geniuses in advance and throw them out of the 33rd Heaven.

The geniuses’ appearance naturally caused a huge commotion.

Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, Han Yu, Qin Ling, and others were also among them.

They looked at each other in shock.

Their wills had always been in chaos. It was unknown what had happened over the years, but they seemed to have a dream.

At this moment, a large number of powerful auras flew over from the Chaotic Cities around the Heavenly Dao.

“It’s really them. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage didn’t lie to us!”

“In the past hundred thousand years, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage has been eliminating the hidden injuries in their bodies.”

“Indeed. That Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit is extremely vicious. He definitely has a backup plan.”

“We should be cautious and ask later.”

“My son, you’re still alive!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The void became lively for some time.

The Heavenly Dao Sages also rushed over to welcome Han Yu and the others.

Knowing that the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was already dead, Dao Sovereign and the others were extremely excited.

“Hahahaha, as expected of my master!”

Zhao Xuanyuan laughed loudly, attracting respectful and grateful gazes. So this was one of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s disciples.

No matter what, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was these geniuses’ savior. His prestige was already unparalleled in the Chaos.

Not to mention anything else, the Heavenly Dao had obtained the admiration of many worlds in the past hundred thousand years. Now, there were already more than a thousand subsidiary worlds, surpassing the Three Pure Sacred World in one go.

More and more factions began to curry favor with the Heavenly Dao. At the very least, they had to express their goodwill. Instead, the Three Pure Sacred World was isolated.

Han Jue only spared a glance at the situation outside the Heavenly Dao. With the Foolish Sword Sage around, nothing could go wrong for the time being. No one in the current Chaos dared to provoke the Heavenly Dao unless he believed that he was stronger than the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.

Han Jue continued cultivating and waited for the Ultimate God of Punishment to be enslaved.

Three hundred thousand years later.

[Primordial Heavenly Prison has successfully enslaved the target.)

(The Ultimate God of Punishment has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.]

Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at the Ultimate God of Punishment beside him.

After the enslavement succeeded, the Ultimate God of Punishment also regained consciousness.

As expected of an existence at the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm, it actually took 400,000 years to successfully enslave him.

The Ultimate God of Punishment stood up and knelt down in front of him. “Greetings, Master.”

The leader of the Divine Spirits knelt in front of Han Jue with a solemn expression and a respectful tone.

“From today onwards, you will continue to be the leader of the Divine Spirits and follow your previous plan. As for our relationship, you are not to tell anyone, understand?” Han Jue said indifferently. He was a little bored upon seeing the Ultimate God of Punishment’s respectful attitude.

He could already feel the loneliness of invincibility.

The Ultimate God of Punishment immediately accepted the order.

Han Jue instructed again and waved him out.

He checked the emails. Over the years, his circle of friends had been very harmonious. There had been no large-scale attacks.

Han Jue was glad.

After reading the emails, Han Jue came to the third Dao Field and called Han Qing’er and Han Huang over.

After entering the temple, the two of them knelt in front of him excitedly.

Han Jue smiled. “You’ve grown up. I won’t stop you if you want to go out in the future.”

His children shouldn’t be in danger with the Ultimate God’s care. “Really?”

“Father, are you enlightened?”

The two of them asked in unison. The second sentence was said by Han Qing’er, making Han Jue speechless.

What was she saying?

Han Qing’er knew that she had said something wrong and hurriedly said, “I mean, why are you allowing us out now?”

Han Huang chuckled. “Other than the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, who else in the current Chaos is our father’s match?”

Han Jue glared at him. “When walking in the Chaos, don’t be arrogant or underestimate anyone, understand?” “Understood!”

“Understood!”

The two of them replied in unison.

That day, the two of them bid farewell to their mothers and were sent out of the Dao Field by Han Jue.

They first went looking for Jiang Jueshi and Liu Bei.

Jiang Jueshi looked at his junior brother and junior sister and smiled kindly. “Where do you want to go? Actually, the Chaos is not that fun.”

Han Huang smiled. “I have to find the Evil Heavenly Emperor. I promised him that once I go to the Chaos, I’ll go to him first.”

Han Qing’er shrugged and spread her hands. “I’ll definitely follow my second brother. Otherwise, what if I’m bullied?”

As long as Han Huang’s cultivation did not touch the Great Dao Supreme Realm, he would almost not be injured.

However, to the Chaos, very few people knew about the Great Dao Supreme Realm, including most Great Dao Sages. They only knew that there was always someone stronger. “Senior Jiang, let’s go together.”

Han Huang smiled and said, “Your potential is very strong. I’ve seen many Great Dao Sages and even the Five Great Divine Punishers. They’re all inferior to you. Why do you have to stay in seclusion here? We can dominate the Chaos if we join forces. Other than my father, who else in the Chaos is our match? Father said that the Chaotic Assembly will still be held. At that time, we will fight in the Chaotic Assembly.

“The eternal peak can only belong to one of

US!”
