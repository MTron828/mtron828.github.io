Chapter 900 Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial

In the purple light.

Han Jue slowly looked up. He could feel his transformation.

His body was sublimating. An unprecedented power was tempering his muscles and bones. The Primordial World in the depths of his soul expanded crazily and was unstoppable.

Gradually, Han Jue’s skin turned purple. His black hair lost its color, and only wisps of white light swayed. His eyes became strange, like two universes with stars.

Han Jue felt the changes in his body. He was extremely happy and didn’t feel any pain.

This was an extreme experience. It was unprecedentedly wonderful, surpassing all joy.

His will jumped above the Chaos and stood higher than before, looking down at the entire Chaos.

The Chaos became tiny. At first glance, the Chaos was surrounded by endless blankness. It was like an ink dot on a piece of white paper, and this white paper was endless.

At this moment, the black dot in the chaos began to change. It quickly expanded as if time had accelerated.

When the Chaos reached a certain size, it suddenly shattered and transformed into countless purple fragments that spread throughout the blank domain. These purple fragments scattered like purple mist and quickly burned through the entire blank domain.

Could this be the Primordial Chaos?

Was everything just a manifestation of space-time reversal?

After the purple mist filled the blank domain, the entire Primordial Chaos began to shrink. Even the blank domain no longer existed. Soon, the Primordial Chaos was as big as before it shrank into chaos, like a drop of purple ink, and the surroundings were absolute darkness.

Nothingness.

How was the Primordial Chaos born?

This thought appeared in Han Jue’s mind, and he began to look forward to the next change.

The Primordial Chaos was still shrinking. After a long time, it finally stopped shrinking, but Han Jue was shocked.

The Primordial Chaos was actually formed by a human head!

It was a hairless purple head with nine eyes. Its eyes were empty and it had no nose or mouth.

What was that?

Han Jue was curious.

Then, everything in front of him shattered.

His consciousness returned to reality.

His physical transformation ended.

(Your Stellar Primordial Body has been upgraded to the Extreme Dao Ultimate Origin Body.)

Extreme Dao Ultimate Origin Body?

Han Jue checked his attributes list and discovered that the words Primordial Fiendcelestial had become the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial!

Above the Primordial Chaos was the Ultimate Origin!

Han Jue was secretly puzzled. Wasn’t this a brand new physique? Why couldn’t he name it personally?

“I want to know if there was an Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial in the past?” Han Jue asked in his mind.

[No, it has never appeared. It’s just that an existence has raised a hypothesis regarding it. The system evolved and created the physique based on this hypothesis, so it’s called the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial.]

“Who made the hypothesis?”

(The previous Primordial Fiendcelestial.]

Han Jue was enlightened.

The previous Primordial Fiendcelestial had also wanted to break through the limits, but its Mystical Power was no match for fate and it still failed.

wer was no

From the looks of it, the system was related to the previous Primordial Fiendcelestial.

“Could the system be created by the previous Primordial Fiendcelestial?” Han Jue continued to ask in his mind.

[No]

No?

How deep was the system’s background?

Han Jue could only suppress his confusion. He couldn’t ask the system, anyway.

He began to comprehend the changes in his body. The Supreme Power had transformed into another even stronger power and was temporarily determined to be the Ultimate Origin Power.

His body was condensed from the power of the final essence and had already exceeded the definition of the body. His soul was no longer single. He discovered that he could easily create countless souls that could be controlled by his will.

The Primordial World in the depths of his soul was a hundred times larger than before. It was contained in the depths of his will and not his soul space.

The purple light on Han Jue’s body began to change and finally turned into a red light. The red light shrank and he quickly returned to his original appearance. However, strange red patterns appeared on his forehead. His pupils were bright red and his white hair fell off. A shrunken sea of stars appeared above his head. It was actually the miniature version of the Primordial World.

Eh?

Bald?

I became a Buddha?

Han Jue didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. With a thought, black hair grew out of his head and the red patterns on his forehead faded. Only the color of his pupils couldn’t change. His eyes could release the Ultimate Origin Power. His strength would decrease greatly once he closed his eyes. He naturally wouldn’t hide them in order to maintain his peak state.

Just like that, Han Jue looked no different from before, but his pupils had changed color.

Excited, he entered the simulation trial and started the challenge.

25,000 Great Dao Supreme Realm Foolish Sword Sages!

Instant kill!

Thirty thousand, insta-kill!

Thirty thousand, insta-kill!

Fifty thousand, insta-kill!

Han Jue kept increasing the number of Foolish Sword Sages. He used the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm to activate the Ultimate Origin Power and directly destroyed all enemies!

The Ultimate Origin Power was so domineering. It completely released the power of the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm!

Eighty thousand Foolish Sword Sages were insta-killed!

A hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages were insta-killed!

Awesome!

Han Jue was filled with heroism. He used his full strength every time he waved his palm. It was satisfying, and the endless power of ultimate essence crushed everything!

A hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages was not the limit!

Han Jue wanted to continue, but he felt something and suddenly stood up, teleporting to the main Dao Field.

He followed Xing Hongxuan to her Daoist temple.

At this moment.

Xing Hongxuan was holding her abdomen. It was growing larger and was clearly throbbing.

Han Jue felt a strong vitality. It was his son!

His son was finally about to be born now that he was no longer the Primordial Fiendcelestial.

Xing Hongxuan was originally very flustered, but she immediately felt at ease when she saw Han Jue.

“Husband… I think I’m about to give birth…” Xing Hongxuan said softly with a trembling voice.

She was already a Sage and should not be afraid, but this kid’s vitality was really exuberant. He was still accumulating a force that was enough to tear her apart. How could she not panic?

Han Jue came in front of her and placed his hand on her belly. He wrapped the fetus with the Ultimate Origin Power to prevent the fetus’ power from injuring its mother.

“This kid…”

Han Jue was suddenly moved. He discovered that the fetus was becoming stronger crazily and even wanted to absorb his Ultimate Origin Power.

However, how could his Ultimate Origin Power be absorbed by the Primordial Fiendcelestial?

Han Jue had no choice but to weaken his strength and convert a portion of the Ultimate Origin Power into ordinary Supreme Power for his son to absorb.

At the same time.

In the third Dao Field, under the old tree.

Han Qing’er suddenly clutched her chest and frowned.

Qingluan’er noticed her abnormality and asked, “Qing’er, what’s wrong?”

“Mother, I feel suffocated for some reason. I feel like a calamity is coming,” Han Qing’er said carefully, her face turning pale.

She was not the only one.

In the depths of the chaos, Han Tuo, who was cultivating, opened his eyes. His face was also pale.

However, unlike Han Qing’er, he already knew of his younger brother’s existence. He first thought of his younger brother whom he had never met.

“What’s that kid doing now?” Han Tuo muttered to himself. Fortunately, Yi Tian was not at his side. Otherwise, that fellow would start nagging again.

On the other side.

Heavenly Dao, Buzhou Palace.

Han Yu opened his eyes and clutched his chest. Beside him, a woman in green was meditating. Sensing his heavy breathing, she opened her eyes and looked at him.

“Senior, what’s wrong?” the woman in green asked in confusion.

Han Yu was a Sage, after all, so she didn’t expect him to feel unwell.
