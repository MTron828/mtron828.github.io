Chapter 315 Unparalleled Prodigy, Strongest in the Calamity

Immortal World, West Heaven.

In a dark cave abode, the Heavenly Dao Buddha sat on a mat. His expression changed as a strange demonic aura appeared between his brows. His entire state was extremely strange.

He suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes were like devils, sinister and terrifying.

“Damn it, I lost control of the Devil Heart. What should I do?”

Heavenly Dao Buddha frowned, his heart filled with anger. Dark Forbidden Lord?!

He really didn’t understand how he had offended him.

In terms of power, the Buddhist Sect was not as strong as the Heavenly Court and the Demon Court. It was even inferior to the Golden Crow Divine Clan’s fearlessness.

Besides!

He wasn’t the only Buddha in the Buddhist Sect! Why was the Dark Forbidden Lord targeting him only? Could it be that he had offended him before?

Heavenly Dao Buddha thought carefully. There were too many people, so he couldn’t confirm

it.

He lost control of the Devil Heart and no longer dared to face the Buddhist Sect. If it was exposed that he was a devil and news spread, the Buddhist Sect would become the target of everyone in the Immortal World.

He could only endure!

Heavenly Dao Buddha sighed and began to suppress the Devil Heart.

Demon Court, Demon Emperor Palace.

The Demon Emperor was talking to a handsome man. This handsome man wore black armor and had a strong figure. His black hair was wild like a black dragon twisting above his head. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This handsome man was the son of the Demon Emperor. His name was Void Emperor.

“Father, don’t worry. I’ve been hiding for five million years. It’s time for me to show off,” the Void Emperor said confidently.

The Demon Emperor smiled and said, “You’re the most hardworking among my sons. You have been in seclusion for five million years. No demon can match your will.”

Void Emperor laughed.

His gaze was filled with anticipation. His potential was outstanding, to begin with. He had been in seclusion for five million years and his cultivation was extraordinary. He felt that he was already a mighty figure and could fight for great providence.

The Void Emperor smiled and asked, “Father, is there anyone you need me to deal with?”

The Demon Emperor was about to reply when his expression changed.

The curse!

Damn this Dark Forbidden Lord!

The Demon Emperor had no choice but to circulate his Dharmic powers to suppress the curse.

The Void Emperor noticed his abnormality and couldn’t help but ask with concern, “Father, what’s wrong?”

The Demon Emperor didn’t hide anything and said in a low voice, “The Dark Forbidden Lord is cursing me again!” Dark Forbidden Lord?! The Void Emperor frowned. After entering seclusion, he had learned the name of the Dark Forbidden Lord from the demons who served him.

In the current heavens, the Dark Forbidden Lord was the most mysterious and terrifying existence. He was secretly manipulating the Immeasurable Calamity and using the curse technique to play with the various powers. Such a method was unprecedented.

In the past, many mighty figures cultivated the Dao of Curses, but no one had relied on curses to influence the myriad worlds like the Dark Forbidden Lord.

“Father, I will definitely find the Dark Forbidden Lord and avenge you!” the Void Emperor said angrily. In his opinion, the Dark Forbidden Lord was definitely not strong. Otherwise, he wouldn’t need to use such a despicable method.

The Demon Emperor said, “You can leave first. Familiarize yourself with the current Demon Court. I will arrange a mission for you later.”

“Alright!”

The Void Emperor took a deep breath and left.

The moment he did, the Demon Emperor couldn’t hold back anymore. He erupted with his powerful aura. The Dharmic powers in his body surged and resisted the invasion of the curse.

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

Han Jue bled from his seven orifices, but his eyes were clear as he stared at the attributes panel in front of him.

He was calculating the number of the lifespan deduction.

Eight hundred million years!

It was unknown if he could spend a billion years to successfully curse the Demon Emperor.

About an hour passed.

When Han Jue’s lifespan decreased by a billion years, he immediately stopped.

His lifespan was still at 745 trillion years. The two billion years he had spent wasn’t even enough to reduce the number at all.

Han Jue raised his hand and wiped his face. The blood disappeared.

He checked the emails to see if there were any updates on the Demon Emperor. However, there was nothing.

Han Jue was stunned.

The Demon Emperor had been very fierce recently. He was clearly the leader of the faction who had been cursed by him the earliest. But now, he was even stronger than the Heavenly Dao Buddha. Han Jue wasn’t disappointed. He took it as a failed attempt.

Perhaps in the next hundred years, any random curse would cause something to happen to him.

Han Jue began to heal his injuries and recovered to his peak several days later.

“It’s a rare occasion that I broke through. Should I use the derivation function again?” Han Jue thought silently.

Let’s try it!

Besides cultivating, there was nothing else to do!

Han Jue thought, “Who is the strongest in this Immeasurable Calamity?”

(A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

A billion years?

Forget it!

Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to continue. After all, the strongest person had nothing to do with him.

He sent a voice transmission to Dao Comprehension Sword and allowed her to enter. Then, he began cultivating.

Outside the cave abode.

After Dao Comprehension Sword heard Han Jue’s voice transmission, she stood up and smiled. “Master’s breakthrough is over. I should go in.”

With that, she turned around and walked towards the cave abode.

The Black Hell Demon Lord clicked his tongue in wonder. “Sect Master is too talented. I feel like he breaks through every 200 years?” The Black Hell Chicken smiled proudly. “Of course. Among the myriad worlds, only our master is the most talented!”

The others nodded. They were all very talented, but no matter how hard they cultivated, the difference between them and Han Jue kept increasing.

“Speaking of which, I can only think of one example like Grandmaster,” Murong Qi suddenly said.

Zhou Mingyue asked curiously, “Who?”

Murong Qi smiled. “I think I said before that Grandmaster is very similar to the Dao Ancestor. The first time the Dao Ancestor made a name for himself, he was the strongest below the Heavenly Dao. From the looks of it, Grandmaster has to wait until he’s invincible before coming out.”

Duan Hongchen frowned.

It had to be said!

They really seemed alike!

After chatting about the Dao Ancestor for a while, they continued cultivating.

This topic had appeared more than once in the long years. They were no longer excited, only amused.

In a hall in the Immortal World.

Wearing a veil, Xing Hongxuan sat on a chair and listened to the elders talk about the recent events in the Immortal World.

“The Immortal Talent Meeting has already ended. There’s indeed a person who has appeared out of thin air and has the potential of a peerless genius.”

“Long Hao, right? I’ve also heard that even the vice sect master of the Chan School praised him non-stop.”

“It’s said that Long Hao is the son of the Heavenly Emperor. It’s not surprising for him to have such talent.”

“Sigh, the bloodline of immortals is indeed stronger than ours.”

“There are also unparalleled prodigies in the Human Race, but they’re still far inferior to Long Hao. I heard that he moved the Heavenly Dao in the Immortal Talent Meeting. His comprehension ability is very exaggerated.”

Xing Hongxuan had a strange look in her eyes as she listened to the elders’ discussion.

Long Hao?

Wasn’t that her husband’s disciple?

Why had he left the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain?

Xing Hongxuan couldn’t be mistaken. There might be more than one person called Long Hao, but there was only one Long Hao who was the son of the Heavenly Emperor.

Hearing that he was already famous throughout the world, the complacency Xing Hongxuan had built up immediately vanished.

Her potential in this life was indeed not bad, but compared to Long Hao, Li Yao, Tu Ling’er, and the others, she was still far inferior. At this moment, the Patriarch suddenly looked at her and said, “Ying’er, you just went to the Imperial Palace not long ago. Did the Imperial Concubine mention what the Sacred Dynasty plans to do next?”
