Chapter 250 Sun Wukong’s Story, Dao Insight Epiphany

Jiang Yi!

Why was this dog here again?

Han Jue frowned and silently recorded his cultivation again. He would use it in the simulation trial in the future.

He stood up and headed into the void.

Dressed in a golden robe, Jiang Yi was meditating and recuperating. Han Jue clearly felt that his aura was unstable.

The Sword God Emperor was really something.

Thinking of him, Han Jue sighed.

This good friend was too pitiful.

From time to time, he would be severely injured.

Han Jue said angrily, “Who do you think I am? You can listen to stories whenever you want to?”

Jiang Yi said weakly, “I’m dying. Quick, tell me a story, help me breathe again.”

Han Jue pondered.

Should he take his life while he was weak?

It would be better than getting pestered all the time.

“Sigh, Divine Palace’s Sword God Emperor is really strong. Although he stepped into the Emperor Realm earlier than me, I can’t defeat him.” Jiang Yi sighed, but his face was filled with smugness. The Sword God Emperor was a famous expert who shocked the world!

Han Jue chuckled.

I can kill you even before I reach the Emperor Realm!

Han Jue suddenly thought of a bold idea.

He smiled teasingly. “Let me tell you the story of a prodigy!”

Prodigy?

Jiang Yi replied, “Go ahead.”

Han Jue sat in front of him and said slowly, “Legend has it that Nüwa mended the heavens…” Sun Wukong!

Han Jue planned to tell Jiang Yi the story of Sun Wukong.

He used all sorts of exaggerated descriptions to describe Sun Wukong’s aptitude and heroism. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Soon, Jiang Yi was entranced.

After several hours, Han Jue finished retelling the Journey to the West.

“Just like that, the insufferably arrogant Great Sage Rivaling Heaven became the Victorious Fighting Buddha of the Buddhist Sect. There was no longer the wild and beautiful Monkey King in the world. The Buddhist Sect now had a loyal… Sigh!”

Han Jue sighed in sadness.

Jiang Yi was extremely displeased and said, “You call this a prodigy? If it were me, I would rather die than submit!

“So the Victorious Fighting Buddha has such a background. No wonder he’s so warlike. His nature is demonic!”

Han Jue felt that he had done enough. He couldn’t help but ask, “What? You know the Victorious Fighting Buddha?”

Jiang Yi snorted. “I’ve heard of him.”

“Then, who’s stronger? You definitely can’t defeat the Victorious Fighting Buddha!”

“Impossible! We’ve never fought. If we meet, I’ll make him kneel and beg for mercy, just like how he begged Tang Seng for mercy!”

Jiang Yi was annoyed and looked at Han Jue fiercely. “Do you not believe in my strength? Shall we fight?”

Han Jue secretly felt disdain. I’m afraid that your Dao heart will shatter!

He pretended to be afraid and waved his hand. “How can I be your match? If you have the ability, go and challenge the Victorious Fighting Buddha. If you can defeat him, I can tell you stories whenever you want!”

Before he could insta-kill Jiang Yi, Han Jue did not want to reveal his strength.

He wanted to secretly cultivate and scare him to death!

“Hmph! Just wait. After I recover, I’ll challenge the Victorious Fighting Buddha!” Jiang Yi said unhappily. Ever since he stepped into the Emperor Realm, he had been arrogant and felt that he was invincible. In the end, he encountered the Sword God Emperor and was already in a bad mood. Now that he was provoked by Han Jue, how could he stand it?

“The Victorious Fighting Buddha has recently come to the Heavenly Court. Although you’re playing tricks, I’ll prove it to you!”

Jiang Yi snorted and closed his eyes to continue recuperating.

He actually guessed his intention!

Han Jue smiled silently and left.

It wasn’t that geniuses like Jiang Yi didn’t like to use their brains, but there was no need.

After returning to the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue immediately entered the simulation trial.

An hour later, Han Jue still killed Jiang Yi.

He was dissatisfied.

Too long!

Indeed, Jiang Yi was also improving!

Han Jue felt a sense of urgency and couldn’t relax.

He was becoming stronger, and so was everyone else.

He had to maintain his speed of becoming stronger than everyone else. Only then would he be safe.

Five years later, Jiang Yi left.

Han Jue couldn’t help but look forward to the battle between Jiang Yi and the Victorious Fighting Buddha.

He continued cultivating. Only ten percent of the stars were still not filled with Dharmic powers.

In the blink of an eye.

Another twenty years passed.

Han Jue finally filled the billions of stars in his body with Dharmic powers. His Dharmic powers rumbled, scaring the imprisoned Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil so much that he screamed.

“Quiet! I’m not killing you!”

Han Jue’s voice sounded, scaring the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil so much that he shut up.

Han Jue continued to sense the Stellar Primordial Body.

All the stars activated their Dharmic powers, causing his body to emit a blinding light. Dao Comprehension Sword was shocked.

“This is?”

Dao Comprehension Sword was surprised. That long-awaited pressure appeared again, even stronger than before!

She immediately fled the Connate Cave Abode.

Han Jue entered a state of epiphany.

His consciousness traveled through his body, sweeping through each star at an extremely fast speed.

There were no living beings on these stars. Only endless Dharmic powers formed a storm that swept through the interior of the stars. It was magnificent and vast, like the end of the world.

As Han Jue passed by the stars, his Dharmic powers connected them together into lines.

From a macro point of view, these lines of stars gradually formed a magnificent picture. It was an extremely profound picture, like a battlefield, but also like high mountains and flowing rivers. It was ever-changing and dazzling.

Han Jue was immersed in it. Somehow, he heard the voice of the Great Dao.

It was as if a Sage was preaching to him, causing his comprehension and essence soul to be elevated.

Some time passed.

Perhaps a hundred years, or perhaps an instant.

When Han Jue woke up again, it was as if a lifetime had passed. [Congratulations on having an epiphany of Dao Insight. The system has begun to upgrade…]

A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue. He ignored it and continued to comprehend the Dao Insight brought by the Stellar Primordial Body.

What was a star?

It was everything, it included everything!

A world was only one of the stars. The sea where the stars gathered was the entire Heavenly Dao!

Including the Great Dao!

Han Jue’s consciousness came to a vast and dark world again, like the beginning of chaos.

A huge door appeared in the boundless fog ahead. It stood towering and high up.

The door was engraved with mysterious symbols that were difficult to understand. When Han Jue approached it, it emitted a dazzling golden light and stirred up a terrifying wind, wanting to stop him.

Han Jue continued forward.

“Are you really going to push it open?”

A voice suddenly sounded, extremely loud and shocking

Han Jue said, “Why not?”

The loud voice replied, “Once you push it open, there will be no salvation. Even Reincarnation will not be able to save you.”

“I want eternal life, not reincarnation.”

“Aren’t you afraid of trouble? There will be endless trouble coming for you!”

“I’m afraid of trouble, but I’m only afraid of problems that will affect my eternal life. If I face a problem brought about by immortality I’ll cut it down with my sword.”

After answering, Han Jue had already arrived at the door.

He raised his right hand and pressed it on the huge door.

It wasn’t as stable as he had imagined. It was very light and could be pushed away with a light push.

Han Jue pushed firmly without hesitation.

Boom

The huge door opened, and golden light shone on Han Jue.

He felt warm all over and couldn’t see clearly. But at this moment, an unprecedented memory surged into his mind, causing his consciousness to go blank.

On the other side.

In a dark hall, an ancient bell floating in midair suddenly rang by itself. The bell sounded vast as it echoed.
