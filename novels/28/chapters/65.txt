Chapter 66: Third Level of the Void Amalgamation Realm, Problematic Disciple

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Revive?”

Huang Zuntian was stunned. Immediately, ecstasy filled his heart.

[Huang Zuntian has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 3 stars]

Han Jue raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw this line.

Favorability went up just like that?

Han Jue was still hesitating about how to brainwash Huang Zuntian.

Great!

This would save him a lot of trouble!

Huang Zuntian took a deep breath and looked up at him. “Fellow Daoist… No, Senior, I’ve thought about many things in the past few decades. I’m indeed not suitable to be the master of a sect. If you’re willing to revive me, I definitely won’t return to the Raincoat Sect!”

Return to the Raincoat Sect?

What was he thinking!

The Raincoat Sect was long gone!

Han Jue calmly said, “This body is the vice sect master of the Nine Dragons Sect of the West Abyss State. He’s a genuine Void Amalgamation Realm great cultivator. I destroyed his essence soul and hope that you can replace him. I’m not afraid of the Nine Dragons Sect, but I’m afraid of endless trouble. Like you, I hope to cultivate in peace.”

A Void Amalgamation Realm cultivator!

Huang Zuntian’s eyelids twitched.

He did not die in vain!

Huang Zuntian was filled with fear.

Han Jue said, “I’ve left my mark in your soul. If you dare to disobey me in the future, I can crush you with a thought. If you listen to my instructions, don’t worry, I’ll let you live a decent life. You only need to help me stabilize the Nine Dragons Sect and hide this matter.”

This was true. After decades of soul imprisonment, his soul had already gained control of Huang Zuntian.

The Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique was so domineering!

Han Jue didn’t need to cast any special spell. He only needed to suppress the enemy’s soul deep within his soul. With time, he would be able to subtly control the enemy.

Huang Zuntian hurriedly nodded and said, “I swear that I will never be your enemy from now on!”

Han Jue nodded and severed his Six Paths spirit energy

Huang Zuntian entered Wei Yuan’s body.

Possession took time.

Words appeared in front of Han Jue.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

[You successfully protected the Jade Pure Sect and obtained a spell manual.]

[Congratulations on obtaining the Still Phase Technique]

[Still Phase Technique: By using this spell, you can force the opponent to reveal his true form. It is effective on all living beings.]

Not bad!

Han Jue didn’t inherit it directly but waited for Huang Zuntian to succeed.

On the other side, the cultivators of the 19 sects remained outside the Jade Pure Sect. Their sect masters did not leave but followed Li Qingzi into the main peak.

Han Jue’s performance was too terrifying!

All the sect masters were scared out of their wits. They no longer dared to attack the Jade Pure Sect, much less leave.

If they didn’t resolve the animosity with such a terrifying enemy, they wouldn’t be able to eat or sleep in peace.

Arriving at the main peak’s main hall, Li Qingzi began to investigate the truth.

This time, no one dared to attack him. They even had to be careful when speaking to him.

In the cultivation world, the strong were respected.

After some communication, the blame was pushed onto Li Qianlong.

Li Qingzi threw the crippled Li Qianlong out and confronted him.

A huge calamity in the Great Yan Cultivation World was successfully resolved by Han Jue’s two attacks.

…

Seven days later.

Huang Zuntian succeeded in the possession.

He felt as if he was in a dream.

He had been bitterly pursuing the Void Amalgamation Realm but to no avail.

He didn’t expect to become a Void Amalgamation Realm cultivator like this.

Was this a blessing in disguise?

[Huang Zuntian’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 5 stars]

Seeing this hint, Han Jue smiled in satisfaction. He liked Huang Zuntian even more.

Huang Zuntian took a deep breath and walked in front of him. He bowed respectfully.

Han Jue instructed, “Go directly to the West Abyss State. If you can’t lie, keep quiet. After all, you’re a great cultivator at the Void Amalgamation Realm. They won’t dare to interrogate you.”

Huang Zuntian nodded. “Don’t worry, I will definitely stabilize the Nine Dragons Sect.”

He turned around and left.

At the entrance, he suddenly turned around and asked, “Do you need me to become the sect master?”

He was very experienced in fighting for the position of sect master.

Han Jue’s expression turned strange, and he said, “That’s up to you. I won’t restrict you. As long as you don’t disturb me and the Jade Pure Sect, you can develop as you wish.”

Huang Zuntian asked, “How should I address you? What’s your Dao title?”

Deity Slaying Elder was only a position, not Han Jue’s Dao title.

Han Jue thought for a moment and then said, “Reincarnation.”

Reincarnation!

This Dao title was very meaningful!

Huang Zuntian smiled and bowed again.

After he left, Han Jue began to inherit the Still Phase Technique.

A month later.

There was a commotion in the cultivation world of Great Yan. The Jade Pure Sect wanted Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou to be arrested, while the righteous and demonic paths joined forces to expel the Wei family.

The itinerant cultivators were confused. What exactly happened?

Apart from having a wide network, the Wei family was not very powerful. They quickly fled with the rest of the family, far away from the cultivation world of the Great Yan.

Peace came to the cultivation world of Great Yan.

Li Qingzi had already declared to the various sects that the Jade Pure Sect had no intention of dominating the world and only wanted to cultivate peacefully. At the same time, he hoped that the Great Yan Cultivation World would be united and not give other cultivation sects a chance.

Han Jue had already displayed his domineering strength. The various sects were naturally more than willing to accept Li Qingzi’s suggestion.

If you can’t win, then don’t fight!

…

Ten years passed in a flash.

Han Jue broke through to the third level of the Void Amalgamation Realm.

This realm was indeed not simple. He had to spend so much time in the early stages.

But compared to Han Jue’s lifespan, it was nothing.

Xing Hongxuan had not returned for the past ten years, but the gray-robed elder who had comprehended the cultivation technique with her had already left.

With the Heavenly Puppet around, Han Jue wasn’t afraid that something would happen to her.

Ever since the Jade Pure Sect had issued the arrest warrant, Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou seemed to have vanished into thin air and no longer stirred up trouble.

However, Han Jue could still see their actions from the emails occasionally.

He even suspected that they were together.

After all, they had always been close.

Han Jue had already imagined a complete BL1 drama.

The male protagonist was forced to become a demon. The second male protagonist couldn’t bear it and sacrificed himself to follow him. They became demons together and accompanied each other forever.

While cultivating, Han Jue habitually opened his interpersonal relationships to check his emails.

[Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked by an itinerant cultivator.]

[Your disciple Yang Tiandong has made a name for himself among the demons. He has more than 100,000 subordinates.]

[Your Divine Pet Chaotic Heavenly Dog was attacked by a Demon King] x68

[Your beloved Xuan Qingjun has returned to the mortal realm.]

[Your good friend Xing Hongxuan had an epiphany. She has comprehended a Mystical Power.]

[Your good friend Guan Yougang is afraid of you and has developed a mental demon.]

[Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck and kills millions of lives. His negative karma is insurmountable.]

…

Han Jue frowned.

This disciple was a true jinx!

He had only left for a few decades, but he had already caused the deaths of millions of lives?

Han Jue suddenly regretted it. Should he have kept Su Qi by his side?

However, on second thought, if he stayed by his side, he might bring disaster to the Jade Pure Sect.

That wouldn’t do.

Compared to harming the people he knew, he would rather let strangers die.

Besides, Su Qi’s jinx status was not given to him by Han Jue.

If there was anyone to blame, it would be the Heavenly Court. They insisted on demoting him.

As for his eldest disciple, was Yang Tiandong not coming back?

Did he plan to be a Demon King forever?

Han Jue was helpless.

Why were all his disciples like this!

[Detected bearer of Connate providence, checking its origin.]

A hint suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue.
