Chapter 1008 Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, Primordial Fiendcelestial

Facing the Great Heavenly God King’s arrogance, Han Huang, Murong Qi, and Formless World immediately surrounded him.

Formless World sized up the Great Heavenly God and clicked his tongue in wonder. “Your strength is an external force, right?”

His voice was very loud, deliberately letting the spectators of Ten Absolute City hear it.

The Great Heavenly God King said proudly, “What external force? This is my inherited power. Besides, at our level, who doesn’t have such power? It’s just that yours is inferior to mine!”

!!

Han Huang snorted. “What’s the point of talking to him? He hid in the beginning and is as scared as a chicken. Now that he sees the hope of winning, he’s pretending to be strong. He’s really shameful as a Ten Absolute!”

The Great Heavenly God King was furious. He glared at him and said, “Come! Let’s see if you, Han Huang, are as powerful as me!”

Han Huang smiled disdainfully and transformed into the Primordial Fiendcelestial. He stared at the Great Heavenly God King and said, “You’re not the only one hiding something. I’m the same!”

Boom

The monstrous aura erupted. The Consciousnessless Great Dao World trembled. The ground collapsed and spatial lightning suddenly attacked.

Eighteen Dharma Idols condensed behind Han Huang, looking like the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.

The eighteen Dharma Idols had different postures. Han Huang attacked the Great Heavenly God King with his might. The eighteen Dharma Idols used their Mystical Powers to attack the opponent.

Before the two sides collided, the Great Heavenly God King was the first to be affected by the illusion Mystical Power. Everything in front of him turned into a scene of the Nine Nether. There were terrifying illusions everywhere.

A green light flashed in the Great Heavenly God King’s eyes. With a look, he broke through the illusory Mystical Power. Rolling flames surged out from his body like a fire phoenix colliding with Han Huang.

Formless World and Murong Qi did not sit back and watch. They quickly joined the battle.

There were only four contestants left competing for the Eternal Peak!

Seeing that the danger had been resolved, the living beings in Ten Absolute City focused on the sky again and began to discuss who would be the Eternal Peak.

Han Jue and the Ultimate God of Punishment’s clone returned to the hall. Han Ling also followed beside him.

In the hall.

The mighty figures were still chatting about what had just happened.

Those Great Dao Supremes were talking about Han Jue’s power. Their blood was boiling.

Han Jue was waiting for the Ninth Chaos.

It was impossible for the Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity to retreat when they saw him make a move. They were definitely restrained by an existence.

Several hours later.

A notification appeared in front of Han Jue.

[The Ninth Chaos sent you a dream. Do you accept?]

As expected.

It’s time!

Han Jue was still a little nervous. He didn’t know if the Ninth Chaos believed him. Although it couldn’t threaten his life, it would affect the people around him.

He chose to accept it.

His will entered the dream. The dream was a blank domain. He saw the Ninth Chaos. It was a black shadow. It was blurry, and he couldn’t see its true appearance.

Han Jue was silent and didn’t speak first upon facing the Ninth Chaos. After all, he didn’t know what the other party was thinking.

“Why did you reject the Chaotic Consciousness’s suggestion?” Ninth Chaos asked.

Han Jue asked in surprise, “Who is the Chaotic Consciousness?”

The Ninth Chaos said, “There’s no need to pretend in front of me. I know very well. You should know who I’m talking about. I also know that you didn’t reject him at the beginning.”

Han Jue said helplessly, “He’s stronger than me. How can I refuse him? I seem to be the strongest in the Chaos, but I’m like an ant in front of you. Your conflict affected me. All I can do is try my best not to participate. However, I have no choice but to be his enemy if he wants to attack all the living beings in the Chaos.”

The Ninth Chaos said, “You made a very smart choice. I naturally won’t blame you since you contributed to protecting the Chaos. I created the Chaos and all living beings. Firstly, it was to attain the Dao, and secondly, it was to satisfy the will of my predecessors. Do you know why the Chaos suppressed the Consciousnessless Great Dao World?”

Han Jue shook his head.

He had a guess, but he didn’t dare to say it.

It was simple. He was afraid that the Chaos would be surpassed!

“If the Consciousnessless Great Dao World exists and other Great Dao Worlds are born, they will be incompatible with the Chaos. What should we do? Not interfere with each other? It will be impossible. It will only produce desire and form a battle between the Great Dao Worlds. At that time, it will not only be the Chaos that will be in trouble. It will be the same no matter which world it is. You should have witnessed the tribulation of the Immeasurable Calamity,” the Ninth Chaos said slowly.

Han Jue agreed with these words.

But so what!

The Great Dao World was a creation that led to a higher realm!

The Ninth Chaos continued, “I’ve already planned to let the Great Dao World exist. This is also the reason why I don’t destroy the Consciousnessless Great Dao World and the Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, a thought from me is enough to destroy it. I plan to wait for the Chaos to evolve to another height and annex the various Great Dao Worlds. This way, I can restrain the Lord of the Great Dao World and reduce the conflict, allowing all living beings in the various worlds to fuse into one world.”

Han Jue was secretly shocked.

This fellow was about to break through to the Creator Lord Realm?

Otherwise, how could the Chaos evolve?

“The Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity have already been suppressed by me. After thinking for a hundred million years, from now on, I hope that you can supervise the Chaos and protect the Chaotic Order. What do you think?”

Han Jue was surprised by the question. It ended just like that?

He had thought that the Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity had perished.

Was the Ninth Chaos so soft-hearted?

No wonder these two dared to challenge the Chaos…

Or perhaps these three had a relationship that he didn’t know.

Han Jue said, “Let’s leave this burden to the Holy Mother of Order or the Ultimate God of Punishment. I’m busy cultivating and don’t have time to manage the Chaos. You should be able to see my past. I don’t care about the Hidden Sect or the Heavenly Dao. Let someone else do it for me.”

The Ninth Chaos was silent.

Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat.

After a long while…

The Ninth Chaos sighed. “You’re really similar to me. In that case, let the Ultimate God of Punishment do this great task. I will let him control the Divine Authority Generals and become the true leader of the Divine Spirits.”

Han Jue nodded and didn’t thank him. The Ultimate God of Punishment was the one benefiting, after all.

The Ninth Chaos continued, “There’s one more thing. The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity has yet to disperse. I don’t know when it will sweep over. It might really be related to the Primordial Fiendcelestial. You have to take action if the Chaos is in trouble. I won’t take action unless the Chaos is destroyed or a higher existence takes action. However, I don’t want the Primordial Fiendcelestial to dominate the Chaos.”

Han Jue asked in surprise, “Primordial Fiendcelestial? Who is it? What sign is there?”

“The Primordial Fiendcelestial is also an illusory legend to me. However, when the Primordial Fiendcelestial appears, you will understand that it will appear in an absolutely powerful manner and make all the geniuses pale in comparison. Although the Primordial Fiendcelestial did not appear in this Chaotic Assembly, it is a very good way to check. You still have to hold this meeting in the future. Change it to once every 50 million years,” the Ninth Chaos instructed.

Han Jue immediately agreed. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He felt helpless.

It seemed that Han Huang was still not good enough.

He was clearly a Primordial Fiendcelestial, but no one considered him the one.

The Ninth Chaos continued, “Regarding the Consciousnessless Great Dao World, it cannot be destroyed. I will create an Endless Era when I succeed. The Chaos will shatter and combine with the blank domain. Then, it’ll be able to accommodate all the Great Dao Worlds, including the one you will create in the future.”
