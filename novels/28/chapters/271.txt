Chapter 273 36th-Grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus

“He treats me as Immortal Emperor Samsara. Now that he’s offering me a treasure, if I refuse, will he become angry and become my enemy?

“But if I accept it, will I offend Immortal Emperor Samsara?” Han Jue touched his chin and fell into deep thought.

It was a question worth considering.

Seeing that the person in the raincoat was unwilling to leave, Han Jue sighed and could only go personally.

His essence soul immediately jumped into the netherworld and used the Somersault Cloud to directly jump in front of Hidden Sect Island.

Seeing Han Jue’s essence soul appear, the man in the raincoat was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly bowed.

Han Jue said, “You can wait a little longer. I’ll go find you when it’s time.”

The man in the raincoat sighed. “You’ve disappeared for so many years. I’m afraid that if I wait any longer, I won’t be able to see you.”

Han Jue was puzzled. Why did this fellow’s attitude change 180 degrees?

Previously, he was very impolite.

Now, his tone had changed.

Could it be that this fellow had encountered something in these years?

Han Jue asked, “Why do you say that?”

The man in the raincoat didn’t hide anything. “I was suppressed by the King of Hell and was injected with boundless negative karma. After the Immeasurable Calamity is activated, I’ll enter Qi Deviation and sink into the negative karma of the world. I’ll never be able to make a comeback until my death.” Speaking of this, the raincoat man couldn’t help but sigh again. So tragic? Han Jue raised his eyebrows. Was the King of Hell so powerful? No wonder he felt vaguely uneasy when he passed by the netherworld.

He couldn’t use the King of Hell in Journey to the West as a reference for the one here.

“I can give you what you want directly. After I die, I only hope that you can complete what you promised me!” the man in the raincoat said in a low voice.

He raised his right hand, and a black lotus appeared in his palm.

This black lotus was extremely strange. It had 36 petals and was completely black. It emitted an ominous and strange aura. Han Jue used his divine sense to probe the black lotus. In an instant, a terrifying force swallowed his divine sense, scaring him so much that he hurriedly severed the connection.

What was this!

Han Jue was shocked. In that instant, he felt that his essence soul would be devoured by the black lotus.

“The 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. In order to obtain this item, I sacrificed my body and the possibility of reincarnation in exchange for it from the Devil Ancestor,” Raincoat Man said with a complicated tone.

He was only a powerful ghost now.

No matter how strong he was, he was still a ghost.

Han Jue asked, “In exchange? If the Devil Ancestor has such a powerful treasure, why wouldn’t he dominate the Immortal World?”

He knew the devils’ ambitions.

“You’re joking. He suffered a crushing defeat in the Immeasurable Calamity and was expelled by the Heavenly Dao. He can’t return to the Immortal World. He can only place his hopes on the devils. I gave my body to the devils, and now they have an Immortal Emperor body in the Immortal World.” Han Jue frowned.

The devils really didn’t know how to give up.

They were planting traps everywhere! There was the demonic path in the mortal world. The Buddhists in the Immortal World had Devil Hearts. And now, they even recruited Immortal Emperors.

Han Jue suspected that one day, the Devil Race would sweep through all worlds again.

No matter how one looked at it, the Devil Ancestor was the ultimate villain!

The man in the raincoat raised his hand and pushed, causing the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus to fly towards Han Jue.

He instinctively resisted, but the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus suddenly sped up and crashed into his essence soul.

Han Jue was shocked. He wanted to expel the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus, but it was gone.

Damn it!

Han Jue panicked.

The man in the raincoat smiled and said, “Since you’ve already accepted it, I believe you can definitely fulfill your promise to me!”

With that, the raincoat man turned around and left.

[Daoist Yuzhi has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 5 stars]

Han Jue looked at the line of words in front of him and became speechless.

He hesitated as he looked at Daoist Yuzhi’s back.

You haven’t told me what the promise is!

Afraid that he would be exposed, Han Jue thought about it and decided to forget it.

It might be troublesome, after all.

Han Jue immediately jumped out of the netherworld, and his essence soul returned to his body.

He hurriedly checked his body, afraid that he would be killed by the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.

However, even after searching for a long time, he still couldn’t find it.

He refused to believe it and continued searching

Several hours later, Han Jue finally found it.

It was actually hidden in the Primordial World, deep inside a star.

Han Jue couldn’t force it out, but he discovered that the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus didn’t harm him.

The nebulous Primordial Qi was cleansing the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. Although the effect was very weak, if it continued, perhaps one day, it could completely transform the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus into a Dharma treasure that belonged to him.

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

It was fine as long as there was no danger.

He thought for a moment and said, “Dao Comprehension Sword, go out for a while.” In the midst of cultivating, Dao Comprehension Sword stood up and left instinctively. After she left, Han Jue called the Heavenly Emperor.

This time, the Heavenly Emperor replied quickly, “What is it?”

“Do you know the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus?”

“How do you know about this?”

The Heavenly Emperor’s tone was extremely serious, making him realize that this thing was really not simple.

Han Jue immediately replied, “I met someone who treated me as Immortal Emperor Samsara. He even took out the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destroying Black Lotus and said that he wanted to give it to me. The aura of that thing was too terrifying. I was so frightened that I immediately fled.”

“Oh? Immortal Emperor Samsara is looking for the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus?”

Far away in the Immortal World, the Heavenly Emperor couldn’t help but frown. At this moment, the Heavenly Emperor was sitting on the majestic golden throne surrounded by nine dragons and looking down at the immortals slaughtering the demons. Frustrated, he thought to himself, “What does Immortal Emperor Samsara want? Could it be that the mysterious existence who wields the Book of Curses is him? I don’t know what his background is or his cultivation goal. He can be said to be the most mysterious existence in the myriad worlds.

“He must have targeted Han Jue!”

Han Jue was the Heavenly Emperor’s treasure. How could he allow Immortal Emperor Samsara to touch him?

The Heavenly Emperor immediately sent a voice transmission, “Where did you meet that person?”

Han Jue said, “The netherworld.”

“Don’t go to the netherworld in the future. The Heavenly Court can’t control it. The netherworld and the Heavenly Court are only helping each other.”

“I understand. Can you tell me the origins of the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus?”

The Heavenly Emperor hesitated for a moment before revealing the origins of this treasure. Legend had it that when the world first opened, four lotuses were born in the world. They contained four different supreme laws. Obtaining one of them could allow one to comprehend the Great Dao.

One of the lotuses transformed into a 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus after experiencing four Immeasurable Calamities.

The 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus contained an extremely terrifying negative karma. It could directly trigger the Immeasurable Calamity before the Heavenly Dao reached the supposed boundary for the calamity to begin!

This black lotus had accumulated the negative karma of four Immeasurable Calamities. It was extremely terrifying.

The Heavenly Emperor warned, “This black lotus should have been suppressed in the land of darkness under the cycle of reincarnation with the Devil Ancestor. He definitely did not let it out with good intentions. Even I am extremely afraid of this item. Don’t get into contact with it, or I won’t be able to save you.”

Han Jue was embarrassed. He had already touched it and couldn’t shake it off. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He very seriously said, “I understand. I won’t touch that thing!”
