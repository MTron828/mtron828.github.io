Chapter 708 Mysterious Fellow Daoist Han

Han Jue frowned as his thoughts ran wild.

His idea just now was indeed a way to make his youngest son temporarily lose the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s bloodline. He should be able to be born.

In that case, it was as if he, the father, was suppressing his son’s potential.

Why couldn’t he give up the Primordial Fiendcelestial bloodline?

This thought flashed through Han Jue’s mind and was quickly abandoned.

No way!

His son was a Primordial Fiendcelestial and had to grow for countless years.

He was the Primordial Fiendcelestial now and could protect everyone around him.

Han Jue wasn’t stupid and wouldn’t cause trouble for himself.

Was there any bloodline higher than the Primordial Fiendcelestial? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Han Jue immediately asked in his mind, “If my bloodline surpasses the Primordial Fiendcelestial, can my son be born?”

(10 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

(Yes, the Chaos only rejects the Primordial Chaos, but there is no bloodline stronger than the Primordial Fiendcelestial at the moment. At least, the system has not encountered any karma of that level.]

This line of words contained a lot of information.

Could it be that the system had encountered the Primordial Fiendcelestial before?

In other words, the system might have come from an even older era than the Chaos.

Han Jue couldn’t imagine it.

He didn’t ask anymore. If he continued asking, he wouldn’t be able to stop. 10 quadrillion years was nothing to him, but it couldn’t withstand the consumption of asking 100,000 questions.

Han Jue looked at Xing Hongxuan again.

He would make a decision when she couldn’t stand her current state and looked for him.

Currently, the existence of her youngest son could still help Xing Hongxuan cultivate. It was a good thing.

Before becoming a human, it was not bad to be a cultivation device.

Han Jue thought silently.

He suddenly thought of a possibility.

If he removed his youngest son’s bloodline, causing him to be born amidst the expectations of countless people but ultimately disappointed them with inferior talent, wouldn’t he fall from grace as the strongest genius of the Hidden Sect? Wasn’t this a f*cking fantasy novel?

Han Jue was actually looking forward to it.

Cough cough!

It was better to wait and see. If possible, he wouldn’t do that. Otherwise, the child would suffer a lot.

Han Jue shook his head and laughed. Then, he slowly closed his eyes.

…

At the edge of the Immortal World, a golden path extended from the top of a peak into the depths of the Dark Forbidden Zone.

This golden path was ten thousand feet wide and grand. One could see some cultivators coming and going. When they passed by, they would greet each other warmly.

After training in the Chaos, when they returned to the Heavenly Dao, the cultivators felt like they had returned to their hometown, so they became enthusiastic.

It had to be said that Pan Xin had indeed contributed greatly. The appearance of the Chaotic Heavenly Road had indeed played the role of uniting the cultivators with higher cultivation levels in the Heavenly Dao.

Pan Xin suddenly landed on the golden light path. Behind him was Jin Shen. The two Sages retracted their Sage aura and suppressed their cultivation to the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm before walking forward.

“On this trip to the Chaos, I’ll also check the Chaotic Heavenly Road. You should be more serious and see if anything is lacking,” Pan Xin instructed in a low voice.

Jin Shen nodded.

He had a strange expression.

He felt that Pan Xin had changed. He had become more stable and responsible, like Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.

In the past, Pan Xin did not care if the Chaotic Heavenly Road was perfected. He only wanted to fight for power.

Could it be that the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage had enlightened him?

For a time, Han Jue’s image in Jin Shen’s heart suddenly improved.

In his opinion, Han Jue was the true perfect Dao Pursuer. He was indifferent to fame and fortune and cultivated in seclusion every day. However, when the Heavenly Dao was in trouble, he never avoided it. He always stood up and turned the tide.

Of course, worship was worship. Jin Shen had no intention of joining the Hidden Sect.

The Hidden Sect was already powerful enough. Even if he joined, it would be very difficult for him to gain Han Jue’s trust. Pan Xin was different. There were too few people around him. He was his right-hand man.

The two Sages strolled forward, but each step covered ten thousand miles.

Soon, they entered the Dark Forbidden Zone. Looking back, they could no longer see the Immortal World.

The golden path was surrounded by darkness. It was extremely dark, with no light in sight. It was extremely oppressive.

Three people flew over and complained to each other.

“It’s all your fault. What information did you find? There’s no opportunity there. It’s complete purgatory!”.

“That’s right. Dao Sovereign, can you be more cautious in the future?”

“Nonsense, it’s all because of the two of you. The moment you entered, you wandered around like ferocious dogs and triggered the restriction.”

It was Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi.

Their auras were a little weak. It was obvious that they had just experienced a fierce battle.

Pan Xin and Jin Shen recognized the three of them. After all, the Sages paid attention to the Hidden Sect. Dao Sovereign and the other two were the faces of the Hidden Sect disciples. They were famous before entering the Hidden Sect.

Dao Sovereign and the other two could not see the Sages’ true appearances. They could only see the fog on their faces, so they did not stop and brushed past them.

In the Chaotic Heavenly Road, they often encountered mighty figures who hid their true appearance, so Dao Sovereign and the other two were not surprised.

After the two sides left each other, Jin Shen sighed. “The Hidden Sect’s foundation is really strong. Those three are actually all Pseudo-Sages.” Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi had also become Pseudo-Sages in the Chaos.

Pan Xin said casually, “Fellow Daoist Han indeed has good taste. The Heavenly Dao is lucky to have him.”

Jin Shen understood what he meant and asked cautiously, “You and Fellow Daoist Han…”

“Nothing. After the Dao discussion, my understanding of him has deepened. Fellow Daoist Han will not be our enemy. He will only be our helper,” Pan Xin said ambiguously.

Irel

Jin Shen’s eyes lit up. Could it be that Pan Xin and Han Jue had already established a friendly relationship or even an alliance?

If that was the case, it would be easier for them to survive in the Heavenly Dao in the future. They wouldn’t be stopped by other Sages.

The more Jin Shen thought about it, the more he felt that his future was bright.

At this moment… Pan Xin suddenly turned around, startling him.

Following the two Sages’ gaze was only darkness. They couldn’t see anything. “What’s wrong?” Jin Shen asked.

Pan Xin said expressionlessly, “Something is staring at us.”

Jin Shen asked, “Inauspicious Evil?”

Pan Xin shook his head.

Jin Shen was surprised. Wasn’t the invisible evil existence in the Dark Forbidden Zone the Inauspicious Evil?

Pan Xin said, “Let’s continue walking and see how long this thing will follow me.”

Jin Shen nodded.

They maintained their previous pace and continued forward.

In the blood-colored starry sky, countless limbs floated in the void.

A dilapidated pavilion floated among countless meteors. Covered in blood, Han Tuo lay on the roof, panting heavily and looking dispirited.

Yi Tian suddenly landed and sat beside him. He panted and asked, “Brat, are you done?”

Han Tuo rolled his eyes at him. “Aren’t you the same? Why are you faking it?”

Yi Tian looked into the distance. Two terrifying huge shadows were fighting in the depths of the void. Boundless fog surged violently, filled with pressure. It was as if this blood-colored starry sky could shatter at any time.

Fear appeared in Yi Tian’s eyes.

The difference was too great. He didn’t even dare to approach the main battlefield.
