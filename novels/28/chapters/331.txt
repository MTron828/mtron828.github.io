Chapter 333 Buddha Taking in the Emperor, Plotting Against the Past

Someone wanted to release all the ghosts in the Nine Nether Purgatory?

Han Jue frowned. He had a bold idea!

If all the ghosts in the Nine Hells Purgatory ran out, could he take this opportunity to hide in it?

No!

If the mighty figure took action, put the ghosts back in, and blocked the entrance, wouldn’t he be a sitting duck?

Han Jue said, “We’ll see. During this period of time, pay more attention to the movements of the Yellow Spring. If there’s really no way, we can just leave the netherworld. I have a Mystical Power that allows me to directly jump out of the netherworld.”

Duan Hongchen was relieved.

He didn’t expect him to stop this as long as he had a way to survive.

Han Jue continued cultivating. He didn’t care about the commotion in the Yellow Spring.

Even the divine sense of a Zenith Heaven Realm expert couldn’t spy on the Dao Field. To discover Hidden Sect Island, one had to have heaven-defying luck.

Several months passed.

Han Jue, who was cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes. He could feel a very strong aura rising from the depths of the Yellow Spring A mighty figure had appeared! Han Jue waited nervously.

He felt the powerful enemies around Hidden Sect Island, but he couldn’t detect them. They were not close enough.

For the next period of time, the entire netherworld was filled with terrifying killing intent.

Seven years later. The White-Robed Buddha called Han Jue in the Reroll World.

After asking via voice transmission, he discovered that the White-Robed Buddha wanted to recommend him a disciple. It was Lu Huaxu.

“This child’s talent is unparalleled. If we nurture him well, he will definitely become a powerful expert of the Hidden Sect in the future. Letting him stay in the Reroll World is a little degrading,” the White-Robed Buddha said excitedly.

Han Jue remained silent.

Lu Huaxu.

The reincarnation of the Purple Star Emperor!

Zenith Heaven.

If he brought a Zenith Heaven into the Hidden Sect Island, would there be danger?

On second thought, no. The Reroll World was in the depths of his soul. Lu Huaxu was also in the Hidden Sect Island. Since that was the case, he would accept him. There was more than one Zenith Heaven in Hidden Sect Island. The Heavenly Dao Buddha was a Zenith Heaven. How could the Supreme Buddha not be a Zenith Heaven?

Han Jue said, “Sure, I’ll take him away directly.”

He immediately locked onto Lu Huaxu.

Lu Huaxu was in front of the White-Robed Buddha. Han Jue directly moved him out of the Reroll World and into the Connate Cave Abode.

Upon seeing him, Lu Huaxu hurriedly knelt down and said nervously, “Greetings, senior!” Although he had awakened his talent, he had yet to regain his Zenith Heaven consciousness.

Han Jue nodded and sent a voice transmission to a disciple.

Soon, Chu Shiren entered the cave abode.

“From today onwards, he’s your disciple.”

Han Jue was expressionless, but he was looking forward to it.

Supreme Buddha took in the Purple Star Emperor.

Let’s see who can suppress who in the future!

Han Jue wasn’t afraid of them joining forces. The Supreme Buddha wished that all living beings would give up cultivating. He would definitely not be on good terms with the inherently strong Purple Star Emperor.

Chu Shiren was pleasantly surprised. He had finally taken in another disciple.

He was tired of Zhou Mingyue.

“Yes, Grandmaster.” Chu Shiren hurriedly thanked him.

Lu Huaxu hesitated. Han Jue waved his hand and gestured for them to leave.

Chu Shiren happily pulled Lu Huaxu away.

However, his nightmare began.

Lu Huaxu’s talent was not something that the reincarnated Demon Saint Zhou Mingyue could compare to. The Immortal Qi of Hidden Sect Island had also surpassed the Reroll World. Lu Huaxu was like a fish in water, so his cultivation progressed rapidly.

In order to suppress him, Chu Shiren had no choice but to cultivate seriously.

Previously, when he suppressed Zhou Mingyue, he could still slack off. However, when facing Lu Huaxu, he really didn’t dare to.

It would be too embarrassing if his cultivation was surpassed by his disciple.

Lu Huaxu’s presence also brought pressure to the other disciples. They were all curious. Where did this fellow come from? He was like another Long Hao!

Three years later, the ten-year period arrived. Han Jue habitually cursed the enemy and checked his emails.

In the past ten years, there was nothing special about the emails. Han Jue didn’t catch any important information, either.

After cursing, Han Jue took out the Heavenly Dao Token and contacted the Heavenly Emperor to ask about the situation in the netherworld.

The Heavenly Emperor said helplessly, “You’re really cowardly. You’re asking me about the netherworld when you’re there? Could it be that you’ve been hiding and didn’t go out at all?”

“That’s right. It’s easy to die outside.”

“You didn’t offend anyone. What are you afraid of? With your cultivation level, if there’s no grudge or hatred between you, no one will take the initiative to kill you.”

The Heavenly Emperor was telling the truth. After reaching the Emperor Realm, if he wanted to kill an Immortal Emperor, there was a high chance that he would attract trouble. If an Immortal Emperor had a remnant soul in his hometown, killing him completely would be impossible.

Han Jue said, “What if? There are always stubborn and reckless people. Even if their cultivation is high, they’re also reckless.”

For example, Zhou Fan, Ji Xianshen, Jiang Yi, and others. The Heavenly Emperor snorted. “What nonsense are you spouting? Forget it. I know that a mysterious existence has opened the Nine Nether Purgatory. Now, he’s fighting against the Divine Palace with the netherworld. The battle in the netherworld is still ongoing.”

A mysterious existence?

Another variable?

“I’ll say it again. If you want to come to the Heavenly Court, come at any time!

“I still have something to do. The Heavenly God General has encountered a tough opponent. I have to go and take a look.”

With that, the Heavenly Emperor hurriedly severed his divine sense.

He hung up.

Han Jue started to think. “I want to know who opened the Nine Nether Purgatory.” [100 million years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

A mere hundred million!

I have a lifespan of a quadrillion years!

Han Jue secretly felt disdain and chose to continue.

Soon, a figure appeared in his mind.

Eh?

Wasn’t this the founder of the Divine Palace, Zu Tu?

He was once the vice sect master of the Jie School and was now the strongest person in the Immeasurable Calamity.

What happened?

This fellow joined forces with the netherworld to attack the Divine Palace he created?

Could it be that he had been betrayed by the Divine Palace before, or was he acting with it?

Han Jue favored the latter. This fellow was the number one in the Immeasurable Calamity. It was as easy as flipping his palm to control the Divine Palace.

The Divine Palace couldn’t be underestimated!

This was the script of a winner!

A new overlord who had never experienced the Immeasurable Calamity gathered countless geniuses. Their providence was comparable to that of an old overlord. No matter how one looked at it, there was a high chance that the Divine Palace would win the Immeasurable Calamity.

If it was before, Han Jue wouldn’t mind if they won.

But now that the Heavenly Court and the Divine Palace were mortal enemies, he couldn’t let them win!

“Should I curse Zu Tu?” Han Jue thought silently.

No! This fellow was the number one person in the Immeasurable Calamity. He couldn’t curse him rashly. He had to think about it after the Book of Misfortune leveled up.

He had to find a chance to inform the Heavenly Emperor about this and let him be prepared. Han Jue shook his head and prepared to continue cultivating.

(Detected that a mysterious existence is plotting to harm you. Do you want to use the Dao Field function to enhance the Dao Field of the past?]

A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue.

He was stunned. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

What the hell?

He quickly chose to use it.

The current Dao Field could block a Zenith Heaven powerhouse’s divine sense. If it was augmented on the past Dao Field, it should be able to block the mysterious enemy.

He was just afraid that the other party was stronger than Zenith Heaven!

“Who wants to plot against me?”

Han Jue’s first reaction was Fang Liang, who had gone into the Primordial Era.

However, Fang Liang had gone too far back into the past. “Why should I guess? Let’s derive it!”

Han Jue cursed silently and hurriedly used the derivation function. After finding out who it was, he would directly curse and force the other party to retreat.

(100 million years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

The moment Han Jue thought of this, a figure appeared in his mind.

He had a strange expression.

Why is it him?

You’re courting death!
