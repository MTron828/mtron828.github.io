Chapter 882 Jiang Jueshi’s Attitude, Heavenly Sage’s Daughter

Han Qing’er retracted her divine sense in fear. She was so nervous that her body stiffened.

She felt like she was in trouble. Would it attract trouble?

She recalled what she had seen in the Immortal World. A cultivator had said that sometimes, a divine sense would attract death if it accidentally provoked a mighty figure.

She recalled the terrifying feeling just now and became more and more afraid. She hesitated for a moment but still decided to find Han Jue.

She entered the Daoist temple and called out carefully, “Father…”

Han Qing’er stopped in front of Han Jue, but he ignored her, making her even more anxious.

On the other side.

In a star.

Jiang Jueshi asked in surprise, “Why does this universe have divine sense? Furthermore, I can’t even deduce where it is?”

Liu Bei knew that it was the commotion of the third Dao Field. He thought for a moment and said, “Actually, there’s a master in this universe.”

Jiang Jueshi’s expression changed drastically.

Liu Bei hurriedly said, “You don’t have to worry. The mighty figure who created this universe is an ascetic. He has surpassed the Great Dao Sage Realm and is a supreme existence in the Chaos. He has already handed the universe to me. I’m the master of this universe.”

Jiang Jueshi’s expression softened. “What’s this mighty figure’s name?”

Liu Bei shook his head. “I can’t say, I can’t

say.”

Jiang Jueshi frowned. “Then, my arrival…”

Liu Bei said meaningfully, “It’s all fate. That mighty figure predicted that you would come a long time ago. He said that this will be the place where you will soar. Your future is immeasurable. One day, he will help you reach the peak of the Chaos and look down on the endless Divine Spirits and mighty figures.”

Jiang Jueshi was flattered.

He had been here for so long and had not sensed the other party’s existence. He naturally would not question the other party’s cultivation.

S were

The mighty figures in the Chaos were immeasurable.

Jiang Jueshi thought for a moment and felt that he was ridiculous. There was no absolute peace in the Chaos. He had been to many places before coming to the universe of stars. They were either barren or occupied by mighty figures.

Since this mighty figure admired him, why not stay and rely on him in the future?

No matter where he was, he had to have a backing. Otherwise, he could only be a rat running around.

Forget it.

The coldness on Jiang Jueshi’s face dissipated. He sighed and continued cultivating.

Liu Bei knew that he had let down his guard, so he smiled and did not say anything else.

It wasn’t good to say too much. Everything depended on time.

He believed that Jiang Jueshi knew what to do.

He had a clear conscience.

In the third Dao Field.

Han Qing’er stayed for an hour before leaving, no longer disturbing Han Jue’s cultivation.

She returned to the tree.

Qingluan’er opened her eyes and asked, “Why are you in a hurry to find your father? Didn’t I say not to disturb his cultivation?”

Han Qing’er curled her lips and hesitated for a moment, but she still told her what had happened. She was afraid that hiding this matter would cause a calamity.

Qingluan’er couldn’t help but laugh.

Han Qing’er was furious. “Mother, what are you laughing at! Do you think I’m lying to

you?”

Qingluan’er shook her head. “No, I believe you. However, the cultivators in this universe are not enemies. They’re actually your father’s disciples.”

“Huh?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qingluan’er was stunned.

Disciples?

She was dumbfounded.

How terrifying was Jiang Jueshi’s voice? She even thought that her father might not be his match. She didn’t expect him to be her father’s disciple?

She hurriedly asked, “Mother, why didn’t Father bring them in? He didn’t mention them, either?”

“Your father has many disciples. Aren’t you uninterested in his story? He has told you many things since you were young, but you always avoid him and argue alone. Blame yourself if you want to blame someone.”

Qingluan’er shook her head with a mocking expression.

Han Qing’er thought about it carefully and agreed.

She became interested in Jiang Jueshi and started to ask about him.

Qingluan’er did not hide anything.

The current Han Qing’er was already a Pseudo-Sage. She should know the higher realms.

Han Qing’er was stunned after she finished speaking

New novels chapters are published ᴏn !

Freedom Sage…

Two realms higher than her!

It was a major realm!

No wonder she was so afraid.

Han Qing’er asked excitedly, “Is he the most powerful disciple under Father?”

This time, Qingluan’er was in a dilemma.

She really did not know.

“I only know that this Jiang Jueshi doesn’t know of your father’s existence. I believe that your father has other disciples. Back then, there were countless disciples in the Hundred Peak Immortal River when we went to see your aunt.” Qingluan’er sighed.

Speaking of which, she didn’t know Han Jue very well. Han Jue was also mysterious to her.

However, he was still her husband no matter how mysterious he was.

Han Jue had been unfathomable from the first time they met. She was already used to it.

Han Qing’er continued to ask like a curious baby.

Time passed.

Year after year passed.

Another hundred thousand years passed.

Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.

Then, he smiled in satisfaction.

He was about to break through after another seclusion cycle.

He sent a voice transmission to Han Qing’er.

She quickly arrived.

Her cultivation level had already reached the late-stage Pseudo-Sage Realm and was already close to the Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.

“Father! Father!” Han Qing’er called out excitedly. She went to Han Jue’s side and started to rub his shoulders with a fawning smile.

Han Jue said, “You want to return to the Immortal World?”

“Can I?” Han Qing’er asked carefully.

Han Jue stood up and smiled. “Of course. I’ll bring you there today.”

“Really?”

“Yes, go say goodbye to your mother. I don’t know when you’ll return.”

“Alright!”

Han Qing’er turned around and left.

Qingluan’er was with her when she returned.

“Husband, we can’t let her leave. Otherwise, she’ll be like Tuo’er…” Qingluan’er said anxiously.

Han Qing’er said helplessly, “Mother, I’m already two hundred thousand years old. Don’t always treat me like a child. You followed my father when you were twenty. How can you trap me?” Qingluan’er choked, not knowing how to persuade her.

Han Jue said, “That’s all. My children and grandchildren will take care of themselves.”

“Thank you, Father!”

Han Qing’er was extremely excited.

Han Jue teleported away with her.

Qingluan’er felt desolate as she looked at the empty Daoist temple.

She suddenly understood how her parents felt when they saw her leave.

In the Hundred Peak Immortal River.

Han Jue and Han Qing’er appeared and came to the 33rd Heaven.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sent a voice transmission to the will left in the Hundred Peak Immortal River several years ago, inviting him to the Universal Hall.

The father and daughter arrived in front of the Universal Hall.

Han Qing’er asked, “Why are we here? Do you want to see Little Yu?”

Han Jue didn’t say anything and walked towards the door. It opened, and Han Qing’er hurriedly followed him inside.

The father and daughter came in front of Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du after entering the hall.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du stood up and bowed. Then, he sent a voice transmission to the Sages.

He looked at Han Qing’er and sighed. “The Heavenly Sage’s daughter is indeed extraordinary. She’s already a Pseudo-Sage.”

Han Jue and Han Qing’er looked similar, and their auras were also similar.

“This is my daughter, Han Qing’er. Greet Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.”

Han Jue introduced them briefly. Hearing this, Han Qing’er hurriedly bowed.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du?

The leader of the Heavenly Dao Sages?

Han Qing’er was shocked. She had heard of the legends of Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and the Divine Might Heavenly Sage when she traveled the Immortal World two hundred thousand years ago.

Heavenly Sage’s daughter…
