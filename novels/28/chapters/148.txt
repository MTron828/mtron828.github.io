Chapter 150 Ancient Grand Magus, Heavenly Immortal Manor’s Calamity

(Tu Ling’er: Ninth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm, the reincarnation of an Ancient Grand Magus. During the savage era, both the Magus Race and the Demon Race fought for the Heavenly Dao’s hegemony. Both perished and lost the great providence of their race. The Magus Race was annihilated, and a few Grand Magi hid in the Six Paths of Reincarnation. Tu Ling’er experienced ten thousand reincarnations and finally washed away the Magus Race’s negative karma. However, her soul is still the soul of a Grand Magus. If she becomes an Immortal Emperor, she can transform into a Grand Magus and gain extreme power. Tu Ling’er is a deacon of the Heavenly Immortal Manor and is here on her Master’s orders to find Fang Liang.)

Ancient Grand Magus?

Only after reaching the Immortal Emperor Realm could she transform into a Grand Magus?

How strong was she?

Han Jue was secretly shocked. This woman was not simple.

However, he noticed that Tu Ling’er had come on the orders of the Heavenly Immortal Manor. She probably had ill intentions.

He was very cautious and started the simulation trial with Tu Ling’er.

A second later, he laughed at himself.

Tu Ling’er only had the background of a Grand Magus and was not a true Grand Magus. Her strength could only match some Body Integration Realm cultivators and was far inferior to him.

Han Jue detected that Tu Ling’er had arrived at the foot of the immortal mountain.

Fang Liang sensed her aura and personally went down the mountain to see her.

“Senior, why are you here?” Fang Liang cupped his fists and asked with an awkward expression.

He had nearly forgotten that he was also a disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Manor.

Tu Ling’er wore a yellow robe and green clothes. Her hair was tied up under a jade hairpin, and she had a beautiful face. Although she was not extremely beautiful, she still looked stunning with her bearing.

Tu Ling’er looked at the mountain and asked, “Fang Liang, what’s the origin of this mountain? Why is the spirit Qi here so dense?”

This was already comparable to the cultivation holy land of the Heavenly Immortal Manor!

How could a small place like the Great Yan have such a treasure trove!

Fang Liang said awkwardly, “This is my first sect. Why are you looking for me? Didn’t I tell the Heavenly Immortal Manor that I won’t return again unless the manor is in trouble?”

The Heavenly Immortal Manor was not a simple sect. Apart from the disciples that they personally nurtured, they would also teach the disciples from other sects and build a good relationship with them.

“With your talent, you’re comparable to Ji Xianshen. Do you think the Heavenly Immortal Manor is willing to give up on you? I came to look for you this time because we encountered a calamity. Dozens of True Devils attacked the Heavenly Immortal Manor, and we’ve fallen into a fierce battle. My master asked me to look for you, hoping to ask the land deity you mentioned in your letter to help. Is he on the mountain?” Tu Ling’er asked casually.

Her gaze was fixed on the Fusang tree at the top of the mountain.

That tree was not simple. Where did it come from?

Fang Liang shook his head and said, “The land deity I met was just a stranger. He left a long time ago. There’s no mighty figure in the Jade Pure Sacred Sect who can help the Heavenly Immortal Manor.”

Tu Ling’er smiled and asked, “Does your Jade Pure Sacred Sect still lack elders? I want to cultivate on this mountain. Help me ask.”

“Huh?”

“What?”

“Isn’t the Heavenly Immortal Manor in trouble? Senior, aren’t you in a hurry?”

“I can’t go back because it’s in trouble.”

“Didn’t you also say that if the Heavenly Immortal Manor is in trouble, you will return? Then, will you return now?”

Fang Liang was speechless. He thought for a moment and said, “Wait here. I’ll go ask my grandmaster.” Tu Ling’er nodded and sat before the stone tablet at the foot of the mountain.

Fang Liang quickly went up the mountain and visited Han Jue.

Han Jue let him in for a chat.

Fang Liang explained the reason for Tu Ling’er’s visit and then said, “Grandmaster, Tu Ling’er’s natural endowment is ranked in the top ten in the Heavenly Immortal Manor. However, she’s famous for being cunning. Now, she’s using the mission as an excuse to leave the Heavenly Immortal Manor. This means that she’s not a good person.”

It was obvious that he did not like Tu Ling’er. However, due to her seniority in the Heavenly Immortal Manor, he had to give her face.

Han Jue asked, “Is she bearing a blood feud?”

Fang Liang thought for a moment and said, “No, she grew up in the Heavenly Immortal Manor. However, she cultivates hard all year round and rarely makes friends.”

“Reject her.”

“Alright!”

Fang Liang left happily. Although Tu Ling’er’s background was impressive, she was already an adult. It wasn’t convenient to brainwash her. Furthermore, she was a disciple of the Heavenly Immortal Manor. Han Jue didn’t want to cause trouble.

Then, he started to check the emails.

After so many years, the True Devils did not cause too much of a commotion. Without Lou Yuxue’s leadership, they couldn’t even take over the Heavenly Immortal Manor. This surprised Han Jue.

The Heavenly Immortal Manor was quite impressive!

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by a True Devil] x 145

[Your good friend Ji Xianshen is severely injured and on the verge of death.]

(Your good friend Ji Lengchan was attacked by a True Devil) x4

[Your good friend Zhou Fan obtained an opportunity and his body transformed.]

(Your good friend Huang Jihao was attacked by a True Devil and was severely injured.]

(Your Dao Companion Xuan Qingjun has comprehended the true meaning of the Great Dao. Her cultivation has increased greatly.]

(Your good friend Mo Fuchou was bewitched by the Devil Race and developed mental demons.]

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen has gained enlightenment of a Sacred Technique. His Essence Soul has transformed.]

Han Jue raised his eyebrows. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Even Ji Xianshen was severely injured. It looked like the Heavenly Immortal Manor was indeed in danger.

Han Jue hesitated to help.

Then, he shook his head.

He had already dealt with the True Devil Commander. If the Heavenly Immortal Manor couldn’t even deal with the other True Devils, how could they face the devils in the future?

Han Jue didn’t want the Jade Pure Sacred Sect to be taken over after he left. In addition, Ji Xianshen’s epiphany of the Sacred Technique was clearly a protagonist’s event. Perhaps this battle would be the one for Ji Xianshen to rise to the top.

Just as Han Jue was thinking, Fang Liang returned.

“Grandmaster, she refused to leave. She said that she could take you as her master.” Fang Liang smiled bitterly.

He wasn’t Tu Ling’er’s match, so he couldn’t force her out.

Han Jue said expressionlessly, “She can acknowledge me as her master, but she has to kowtow for ten years first.”

Fang Liang hesitated when he heard that, but he still went down the mountain to pass the message. Dao Comprehension Sword asked curiously, “Are you really going to accept her?” Han Jue smiled and said, “Let’s see if she’s willing to lower her head first.”

At the foot of the mountain, after hearing Fang Liang’s words, Tu Ling’er directly knelt in front of the stone tablet and began to kowtow.

Fang Liang frowned and asked, “What’s the point? Even if you want to avoid the Heavenly Immortal Manor’s calamity, you don’t have to do this.”

As Tu Ling’er kowtowed, she smiled and said, “To be able to make you give up the preferential treatment of the Heavenly Immortal Manor and to be able to nurture such a precious mountain, the master of this mountain must be the land deity you believe in.”

Fang Liang was silent.

There was one more thing Tu Ling’er did not say. In fact, it was not that the Heavenly Immortal Manor wanted Fang Liang to return. How useful could Fang Liang be to the manor’s current calamity?

mai

She was the one who took the initiative to look for Fang Liang, using the excuse of gathering the forces outside the manor.

Ten years ago, when Tu Ling’er was cultivating, she would always fall asleep easily. In her dreams, she often saw a mountain with a mysterious figure on it.

At first, the dream was blurry, but later, it became clearer. She knew that Fang Liang, who she had interacted with before, was kneeling in front of the mysterious figure. She knew that he was related to Fang Liang.

Tu Ling’er always believed in her dreams.

Ever since she was young, she had even comprehended Mystical Powers in her dreams.

This was also the reason why she became a genius of the Heavenly Immortal Manor.

When Han Jue asked her to kowtow for ten years, her first reaction was not anger but relief.

The other party spoke so arrogantly. He must be a mighty figure!

I knew it!

The dream realm guided her towards the fortuitous opportunity again! Seeing that she was determined, Fang Liang did not continue persuading her. He turned around and left, preparing to return to his residence to continue cultivating.
