Chapter 672 Breakthrough! Karma Heaven

Han Jue and Divine Lord Peacock chatted for a long time. After Divine Lord Peacock returned, under Han Jue’s instructions, he began to talk about what had happened when he was captured by the Inauspicious Divine Emperor. It turned out that the Inauspicious Divine Emperor did not hand him over to the Evil Heavenly Emperor at all. Instead, he used him to bargain with him.

While the two sides were fighting, Divine Lord Peacock escaped. Divine Lord Peacock even asked if Han Jue had asked the Inauspicious Divine Emperor to let him escape on purpose. This was because the last time the Inauspicious Divine Emperor attacked, his strength was much inferior as if he was severely injured.

Han Jue only smiled and didn’t say anything. Divine Lord Peacock was still very puzzled. Since the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the Inauspicious Divine Emperor were both working for the Dark Forbidden Lord, why were they fighting among themselves?

Han Jue asked, “Why are the Three Pure Ones divided into three branches?” Divine Lord Peacock was silent. No matter what, Han Jue accepted Divine Lord Peacock. He let him recuperate first and contact him in the future.

After the battle with Pan Xin, Divine Lord Peacock’s soul origin had been damaged greatly. He needed time to recuperate.

“I have to break through quickly. When the time comes, I’ll capture Divine Lord Peacock and throw him into the Primordial Heavenly Prison. He’ll completely become my lackey.” Han Jue thought silently. If he defeated Divine Lord Peacock and he sincerely submitted, Han Jue couldn’t use the Primordial Heavenly Prison. Continue cultivating! Han Jue perked up and started sprinting!

Six hundred years later, Han Jue began to break through. It took him more than three hundred years to break through.

Awesome!

It had been a long time! His Dharmic powers surged! His soul was elevated! Every breakthrough was a sublimation!

At this moment, Han Jue felt that his potential was not so mediocre after all. As he consolidated his cultivation, he checked his attributes panel.

(Name: Han Jue]

(Lifespan: 197,490 | 6,304,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999]

[Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]

(Cultivation: Late-stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm (Perfect Sage)]

(Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]

[Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]

Not only did his lifespan increase, but it also doubled!

Han Jue felt that it was a little ridiculous how his lifespan refreshed every time he broke through. Coupled with the Book of Misfortune, he was simply invincible.

However, on second thought, he had to break through quickly.

If it were anyone else, how could they break through so quickly? Even if he gave the Book of Misfortune to others, once they became addicted, they would be squeezed dry by the book before they could break through and refresh their lifespan. They would die of old age. Han Jue felt that he couldn’t rely on the Book of Misfortune. He had to reduce his reliance on it.

Two hundred years later, Han Jue completely stabilized his cultivation. He first checked the emails.

(Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by your enemy, Karma Heaven. He was severely injured.)

(Your son Han Tuo was attacked by your enemy, Karma Heaven. He was severely injured.)

(Your good friend Pan Xin has obtained Pangu’s inheritance. His cultivation has increased greatly.]

(Your good friend Empress Houtu comprehended the chaos and obtained the comprehension of reincarnation. Her cultivation has increased greatly.)

(Your good friend Heavenly Calamity Emperor was cursed by a mysterious curse.)

[Your son Han Tuo was deprived of his body by your enemy, Karma Heaven. His soul was imprisoned.]

(Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil) x78902922 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has entered the Dark Forbidden Zone.]

Han Jue frowned when he saw Han Tuo’s encounter.

Karma Heaven!

How dare you hurt the Heavenly Emperor and my

son!

Not only that, but you also took away my son’s body! Han Jue was worried that Karma Heaven would discover the secret of Han Tuo’s body. He immediately took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing him. Needless to say, he would definitely be killed in one go.

[Karma Heaven: Great Dao Divine Spirit, formed by the Great Dao of Karma. Later, it was controlled by Ancestor Xitian and was deprived of the Great Dao Origin. Therefore, it hates the Heavenly Dao. Because you stopped his plan to destroy the Heavenly Dao, it has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]

Han Jue checked Karma Heaven’s information again. Not only was he helping the Heavenly Emperor and Han Tuo, but he was also helping the ancestor eliminate a great enemy! Five days later. Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease rapidly. He opened his attributes panel and stared at his lifespan. A hundred million years! A billion years!

Ten billion years!

A hundred billion years! A trillion years! 10 trillion years! 100 trillion years! Han Jue continued cursing. His current lifespan was not worth mentioning in his eyes. He suddenly remembered that he had decided to use the Book of Misfortune less.

Just this once. One last time. Using it less did not mean he would not use it. After adjusting his state of mind, Han Jue focused on cursing

In the dark starry sky, there was a huge oil lamp. Millions of souls floated in the wick. They were imprisoned here and could not escape. Han Tuo and Yi Tian were also among them. Yi Tian said, “Brother, do you find this scene familiar?” Frustrated, Han Tuo was asked in an annoyed tone, “What do you mean?”

“Back then, when I was suppressed by the Dark Sage King, was it very similar to now?”

ILII

Han Tuo couldn’t understand Yi Tian’s mind. He was still in the mood to joke. The enemy this time was different from the past. Even the Evil Heavenly Emperor was severely injured. Millions of Heavenly Troops were suppressed here and endured the burning of the lamp. It was a fate worse than death. Han Tuo couldn’t help but think of his father. He was his only hope. He said that he wanted to grow up on his own. He didn’t expect to need his father’s help again. At this moment… The dark starry sky stirred up a cold wind. The lights of the huge oil lamp swayed as the fire increased, causing many Heavenly Troops to wail. A great pressure descended. Han Tuo actually felt as if his soul was about to dissipate. What happened? Han Tuo was shocked and swept his gaze in all directions.

Yi Tian asked carefully, “What does that fellow want?”

Han Tuo did not answer him. The huge oil lamp had a mysterious restriction that prevented them from using their divine sense. They could only use their naked eyes to capture it. “Hmph, what a Heavenly Court. I didn’t expect you to have the backing of the Dark Forbidden Lord!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

A cold snort sounded. Han Tuo remembered that the other party was the mysterious mighty figure who had suppressed them. Millions of Heavenly Troops were captured by the other party with a single hand. It was still a nightmare to think about such a Mystical Power.

“Since you want to save them, I’ll devour their bodies!”

Karma Heaven’s voice sounded again. In an instant, Han Tuo’s expression changed drastically. He felt that his body was already gone. It was not only him. The other souls could also feel it. This feeling was extremely uncomfortable, causing their souls to quickly weaken.

(Because of your curse, your enemy Karma Heaven’s Dao heart has wavered.)

[Because of your curse, your enemy Karma Heaven’s Dao heart shattered and his cultivation decreased greatly.)

(Your enemy Karma Heaven has devoured a million living beings. His bloodline has fused with them and his providence has increased greatly.]

Seeing the latest emails, Han Jue’s expression darkened.

Could it be that Karma Heaven had eaten Han Tuo?

Courting death! Han Jue continued cursing. He had already consumed 2 quadrillion years of his lifespan, and it was still decreasing. 3 quadrillion years!

[The mental demons of your enemy, Karma Heaven, were born because of your curse.)

4 quadrillion years!

(Your enemy, Karma Heaven, is affected by your curse. His mental demons are causing trouble. His bloodline is surging and his body was destroyed.]

5 quadrillion years! Aren’t you going to die?
