Chapter 1134 Determination to Become Immortal, Creator Lord’s Favoritism

Chu Xiaoqi was convinced by Han Tuo’s appearance. Such a figure was definitely a very powerful cultivator. He looked forward to his teaching, but in less than a day, he regretted it.

How was this cultivation? He was completely beaten up!

At the back of the villa.

Han Tuo established a barrier independently. The internal space was larger than the entire mortal world. Although Chu Xiaoqi was surprised, he did not realize how big the space inside this barrier was.

Chu Xiaoqi lay in the ruins, panting heavily. His clothes were ragged and he was covered in blood. He was in an extremely miserable state.

He looked at the high and mighty Han Tuo, his eyes filled with despair.

“Uncle, can you stop?”

“I’m not your uncle. We’re enemies now. The enemy won’t let you rest in a battle of life and death!”

“But I’ve used up all my spirit energy…”

“What I am teaching is to fight to the death even if your spirit energy is exhausted!”

Han Tuo attacked Chu Xiaoqi again. The power was extremely terrifying. Chu Xiaoqi felt that if he did not dodge, he might really die. He had no choice but to grit his teeth and dodge.

After seven days, Chu Xiaoqi finally came out of the barrier.

He dragged his injured body as he went to find Han Jue. Tang Wan covered her mouth when she saw him, but she didn’t say anything. After all, the one who taught Chu Xiaoqi was Han Jue’s biological son. He was trustworthy.

Chu Xiaoqi came in front of Han Jue and cried.

This time, Han Jue’s heart didn’t soften. He didn’t let him off no matter how much he pleaded.

Chu Xiaoqi left helplessly.

Then, Han Tuo came to visit him respectfully.

He didn’t dare to be as unreasonable as Chu Xiaoqi. Facing Han Jue, he still felt distant because he was experienced and knew how strong his father was.

Han Jue began to preach the Dao. The father and son didn’t need to exchange pleasantries. It was more realistic to directly preach the Dao.

He used the power of time, making this lecture independent of time. Only a few days had passed when Han Tuo finished listening to the Dao.

Han Tuo found Chu Xiaoqi again and ignored his resistance. He carried the kid into the

barrier.

Tang Wan was a little worried about Chu

Xiaoqi, so she found Han Jue. Seeing that she couldn’t change this matter, she could only

give up.

This time, Chu Xiaoqi stayed in the barrier for a long time. Of course, he was forced to do it.

One day, Xing Hongxuan returned.

She entered Han Jue’s residence and pounced into his arms. She acted coquettishly like Chu Xiaoqi and talked about what she had seen and heard during this period of time.

Han Jue listened patiently.

In the end, Xing Hongxuan asked him about

his plan for Chu Xiaoqi. Calling Han Tuo over was enough to show how much he valued this

kid.

Chu Xiaoqi was her only grandson, so she naturally had to care.

Han Jue smiled. “He has the potential to become a Primordial Fiendcelestial.”

Xing Hongxuan frowned in joy. “Aren’t you

going to tell Huang’er about this?”

“No need. That kid is busy building his Primordial Chaos. Besides, he might not have

this son in his heart at all.”

“But if that’s the case, this father and son

will…”

“Huang’er also needs to be corrected,” Han Jue said meaningfully. If he nurtured other descendants to surpass Han Huang, this fellow would only be angry. However, if it was

a son who he was guilty towards, that would

be a different story.

Xing Hongxuan smiled. “I think you just dote on Xiaoqi. How can you be so unreasonable?” “That’s right, I dote on him. As the master of the Endless Era, do I need to worry about anything when I dote on someone?”

“Yes, yes, yes. You’re the best. I’m going to bring Tang Wan away. Her potential is too poor. She won’t be able to keep up with Xiaoqi

sooner or later.”

“Yes, I’ll tell Wan’er to say goodbye to him after Xiaoqi comes out. I’ll also stimulate this

kid to work hard.”

“You’re really something.”

Xing Hongxuan also found it interesting and

even began to look forward to Chu Xiaoqi’s reaction.

That day, she found Tang Wan and showed her ability. Tang Wan was pleasantly surprised and immediately acknowledged her as her master.

When Xing Hongxuan suggested bringing her

away and not seeing Chu Xiaoqi for a long time, she immediately panicked and hesitated.

Ever since her brother died, Chu Xiaoqi had

been her only family. Furthermore, she had always loved him as he always protected her.

How could she abandon him for opportunities? “Forget it. I can’t leave him.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Tang Wan sighed and her eyes became firm.

For the sake of love, giving up longevity was undoubtedly a huge determination.

She could also tell that Han Jue only cared

about Chu Xiaoqi. She was only a side character.

Xing Hongxuan smiled. “Cultivators can live

for more than a thousand years or ten thousand years. As the difference in your cultivation levels increases, you won’t be able to keep up with him sooner or later.”

She waved her right hand, and a memory surged into Tang Wan’s mind.

It was a Daoist temple. The old her lay on the bed, preparing to welcome her end. Beside her stood Chu Xiaoqi, still young and even more handsome.

The difference between life and death. This memory was very short. There were no

words, but silence was better than words. When Tang Wan woke up, she was deeply

stimulated and sweat broke out on her forehead.

After struggling for a long time, she finally

agreed and followed Xing Hongxuan to cultivate.

Half a year later.

Chu Xiaoqi finally came out of the barrier.

This time, he seemed to have been reborn. He

was like an unsheathed sword, revealing its sharpness.

This time, he didn’t look for Han Jue but Tang

Wan. However, he only found a jade slip in her house. He injected spirit energy and a shadow appeared. It was Tang Wan. “Brother Xiaoqi, I’ll have already left when

you see this letter. I’ve obtained the favor of

an immortal. She wants to bring me to the Immortal World to cultivate. Actually, I’ve always liked you, but you don’t seem to like me enough.

“I didn’t want to leave you at first, but then I saw the future. Without opportunities, I can’t keep up with you. You’ll still be young when I

die. I don’t want this. I want to walk side by side with you.’

Tang Wan’s eyes turned red as she continued,

“I have to cultivate and catch up to you. However, my only regret is that I don’t know

if

you like me. Grandpa said that we are fated,

but are we really?

“Brother Xiaoqi, see you in the future. We will

definitely meet as long as you don’t forget me.”

Tang Wan’s shadow dissipated. Chu Xiaoqi stood in front of the table and

remained silent.

Several days passed, but Chu Xiaoqi did not leave Tang Wan’s room.

Han Tuo sat at the edge of the cliff as his thoughts drifted. He also thought of the most important woman in his life. His old friend

was already dead and had already become a memory.

He could revive that person, but he felt that it would only be a shell, not the true person. Some people and some things could be placed in his memories. Half a month later.

Chu Xiaoqi finally came out. He still didn’t

look for Han Jue or ask if the immortal who took Tang Wan away was related to his grandfather. He directly found Han Tuo and continued cultivating. They entered the barrier again. Han Jue walked out of the house and stood in

the courtyard, enjoying the sunlight. He smiled.

Since he had nothing to do, he stretched and checked his emails. Soon, he saw a noteworthy email. [Your disciple Ji Xianshen has crossed the

Origin Space-time. His karma has been severed.]
