Chapter 792 Creator Lord, Invincible

“But then again, won’t they be able to hide everywhere if ten thousand Divine Authority Generals act together? They aren’t strict enough, or do they have special methods?”

Han Jue thought silently.

He did not use the derivation function. He had already checked. He couldn’t escape this disaster at all. Why waste his lifespan?

Han Jue adjusted his state of mind and started cultivating

He wanted to attain the Great Dao Supreme Realm before the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority attacked!

Otherwise, he would not feel safe!

It was not so easy for Han Jue to fight two thousand Foolish Sword Sages alone, let alone ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.

Huang Zuntian was meditating and cultivating in a pool of water in the mysterious space.

Like Li Daokong and Shi Dudao, he had already become a Calamity Life Controller, but he needed some time to move freely.

A figure appeared by the pool.

“Huang Zuntian, have you thought about it?” the mysterious figure asked with a hoarse voice.

Huang Zuntian opened his eyes and asked, “Do I have a choice?”

The mysterious figure said, “Indeed. But you’ll suffer less if you think it through. You’ve been captured until now and no one has come to save you. Why are you so loyal to the Heavenly Dao?”

Huang Zuntian was silent.

The mysterious figure continued, “The Chaos has existed for too long. The current Chaos is still deathly silent. It has wasted space and everything we have now. Everything is because of those Great Dao Sages and Great Dao Divine Spirits. They are afraid that all living beings will surpass them. They are afraid that they can’t control the Chaotic Order, so they always restrict the development of the Chaos. What Life has to do is overturn everything and create an unprecedented new era. Can you imagine the prosperity of the Heavenly Dao appearing in every corner of the Chaos?

“That’s what Life pursues!

“Before that, all the casualties caused by the battle are worth it. You should understand!”

Huang Zuntian took a deep breath and asked, “Can I meet the leader?”

The mysterious figure said, “Life has no leader. Every Life is equal!”

Huang Zuntian raised his eyebrows and asked, “Someone has to give orders, right?”

The mysterious figure was silent.

Huang Zuntian cursed silently. Trying to trick me?

It was impossible for a fully formed force to be completely equal internally!

“You have to show your value if you want to see Master,” the mysterious figure said.

Huang Zuntian said, “You should understand me since you captured me. I started from the bottom and climbed the ladder in the Jie School to the position of Sect Master. I even attained the Dao. This experience is not something that other Sages can compare to. I don’t have a powerful background, and I have grown up relying on my own ability. Although Life is powerful now, I feel that you lack management and true plans.

“You’re right. There’s indeed no need for me to continue to contribute if the Heavenly Dao doesn’t save me. It would be best if Life made me stronger. Since I’ve joined Life, I don’t want to be cannon fodder. Of course, I have to show my value if I want to obtain power and status. You’re responsible for receiving me. I’ll definitely remember your kindness if I soar in the future.”

His tone was sincere, and the mysterious figure was moved. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Alright, I’ll go ask first. Continue cultivating.”

“Thank you, Fellow Daoist!”

The mysterious figure vanished.

Huang Zuntian continued cultivating. He did not lose his composure to prevent anyone from spying on him.

Heavenly Court, Numinous Palace.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor sat on the Emperor’s throne and flipped through the jade slip on the table. The jade slip opened and he scanned it. A large amount of information surged into his mind. These jade slips contained restrictions and contained a huge amount of information that mortals could not imagine.

Black Heaven General suddenly entered the hall and cupped his fists. “Your Majesty, the two candidates have arrived. Do you want to see them?”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor replied, “Let them in.”

Only one of the three Divine Generals of the Heavenly Court was left ever since Han Tuo and Yi Tian left.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor had already screened many Heavenly Generals, but he was still not satisfied.

Soon, two figures walked into the hall and knelt in front of him.

The two of them were tall and mighty. Their eyes were filled with cold killing intent. It was obvious that they had just come from the battlefield.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor sized them up. He was slightly satisfied, but he still felt some regret.

“I’ll let you try first. I’ll give you a million Heavenly troops to take down this world in ten thousand years!”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor threw out a jade slip, and one of the Divine Generals hurriedly caught it.

“Black Heaven General, bring them down.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor waved his hand. The Black Heaven General immediately accepted the order. After the three of them left, the Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at the empty Numinous Palace and was lost in thought.

He suddenly missed the scene of Yi Tian arguing in the hall.

The Numinous Palace was too quiet without him.

He was always worried when giving missions without Han Tuo.

No!

He still had to choose the prodigy of providence!

The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s eyes flickered as his thoughts drifted to the Heavenly Dao.

Time passed quickly.

Fifty thousand years passed quickly. The Dao Field was finally successfully upgraded. The various Qi in the main Dao Field and the second Dao Field began to increase majestically.

[The Dao Field has been upgraded. The array formation has been upgraded to the Creator Lord-level. The space inside the Dao Field has been expanded.]

[Dao Field Immortal Qi has increased by ten times. Connate Qi has increased by ten times.)

[The Dao Field can block all prying eyes.]

Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at the information in front of him.

Creator Lord-level?

There was a realm above the Dao Creator?

Han Jue frowned. He couldn’t help but ask in his mind, “Is there a Creator Lord in the current Chaos?”

[9 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)

Continue!

[Not for the time being.]

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

In that case, the ceiling of the Chaos was the Dao Creator Realm. In other words, from today onwards, no existence could barge into his Dao Field?

Han Jue was overwhelmed with joy.

An unprecedented sense of security surged into his heart.

No!

Steady!

“I want to know if there is anyone in the current Chaos who can break through the Dao Field?”

(1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[No]

“Can the Dao Field be broken through?”

(i quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

(You can be controlled by the enemy and made to destroy the Dao Field yourself.]

Han Jue: “…”

But it was indeed possible on second thought!

Perhaps those mysterious and powerful existences could take advantage of his carelessness to control his consciousness.

It was not impossible!

Han Jue secretly noted this down. He couldn’t let his guard down even if there was an absolutely defensive Dao Field.

Although the Dao Field had been upgraded again, it only expanded the internal space and couldn’t cover the entire Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, Han Jue could directly protect the Heavenly Dao.

What a pity.

No matter what, Han Jue was very happy.

Five million years later, he could still hide here even if he couldn’t defeat ten thousand Divine Authority Generals!

It would be fine even if he exposed his Primordial Fiendcelestial identity!

At most, I’ll wait until I reach the Dao Creator Realm and kill all the enemies!

Han Jue felt that he was already invincible.

But he couldn’t be arrogant!

Han Jue immediately started the simulation trial and challenged the ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages.

He was tortured.

Han Jue’s eyes became clear and he became restrained after he ended the simulation trial.

Thank you, Foolish Sword Sage.
