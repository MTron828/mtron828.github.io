Chapter 750 Heavenly Dao Justice

After ignoring the Foolish Sword Sage, Han Jue suddenly thought of a question.

“The Great Dao Divine Spirit is not restricted. Can the Primordial Heavenly Prison enslave him?”

[Yes, because of you, the system has already surpassed him.]

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

It seemed that the system was still the best. It was even more ferocious than the Great Dao.

He couldn’t help but become curious about the system’s origins again. Unfortunately, the system could not explain it.

Han Jue thought of something else.

“The battle today has caused such a huge commotion. It endangered the Heavenly Dao and involved the Great Dao Divine Spirit. It didn’t trigger the choice?” Han Jue asked in his mind, wanting another reward.

[The system has detected that the current crisis is not enough to threaten you or affect the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, so it cannot trigger the choice.]

Han Jue was helpless.

Was it all because he was too strong?

At this moment.

[Foolish Sword Sage sent you a dream. Do you accept?]

Again?

Han Jue frowned and thought for a moment. He still accepted it lest he missed important information. However, before that, he sent out a clone to monitor the Divine Robe Daoist in the Primordial Heavenly Prison.

“I want to know if it’s dangerous to accept this dream?” Han Jue asked in his mind. The other party was not an ordinary person and could be considered the strongest person he had encountered so far. As for the Dao Ancestor, Pangu, the Chaotic Deities, and the Holy Mother of Order, he had only heard of them. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

(300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[No]

Han Jue chose to accept the dream.

After entering the dream, he appeared in the Primordial Void. A figure stood in front of him. It was the Foolish Sword Sage.

The two stood facing each other in silence.

Han Jue didn’t know what to say.

Threaten?

Taunt?

That was meaningless.

Beg for mercy?

nu

Bah, what logic was that?

As for comforting him, that was even more meaningless. In any case, if Han Jue lost, he would only feel even more uncomfortable.

Speaking of which, Han Jue had never lost in this life.

It was because he was cautious enough not to fight without confidence.

The Foolish Sword Sage took a deep breath and said, “You’re very strong. I’ve never met an existence like you. You’re definitely invincible among your peers.”

Han Jue said, “You’re also very strong. In the same realm, no one has ever given me such pressure. I tried my best to defeat you.”

The Foolish Sword Sage snorted. “Defeat is defeat. I can afford to lose. I didn’t send you a dream this time to say anything harsh. Since you killed the Divine Robe Daoist, there’s no grudge between us. I’ll challenge you again in the future. Perhaps after defeating you, I’ll have a chance to avenge myself.”

Han Jue couldn’t help but ask, “You, the Divine Robe Daoist, and that Hatred Concubine are all mighty figures who have cultivated for countless years. Why do you have to attack someone’s hometown? What do you want? Opportunities? Can you become stronger if you obtain the Heavenly Dao? For prestige? Who dares to disobey the Great Dao Divine Spirits in the Chaos?”

“You! You’ve already killed two Great Dao Divine Spirits.” The Foolish Sword Sage snapped.

Han Jue said stubbornly, “I was forced. Who asked them to bully me? Those who bully others don’t have a good outcome.”

The Foolish Sword Sage said, “To borrow the words of you humans, the human heart is unfathomable. It’s the same for deities. If they want to restrain the Chaos, they have to rely on powerful strength. In the past, the Great Dao Divine Spirits were like what you said. They cultivated in peace and did not cause trouble until they encountered a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.”

“Who?”

“Pangu.”

Han Jue was silent.

So that was the case. No wonder the Great Dao Divine Spirit was afraid of the Heavenly Dao.

The Foolish Sword Sage continued, “In order to prevent Pangu from reviving, the Great Dao Divine Spirits had once joined forces to deal with the Heavenly Dao. However, they were stopped by the Dao Ancestor. He promised that he would never let the Heavenly Dao be too powerful. He begged the Divine Spirits to leave the Heavenly Dao alive. This order lasted for countless years. In the long years, many mighty figures were born until the Dao Ancestor disappeared. Then, you appeared.”

Han Jue showed a frown.

In that case, the current calamity of the Heavenly Dao was his fault?

Ridiculous!

Foolish Sword Sage changed the topic. “Let’s not talk about this. I just want to know what Mystical Power you used earlier?”

Han Jue said, “Heavenly Dao Justice.”

“Heavenly Dao Justice…” the Foolish Sword Sage muttered to himself and pondered.

Han Jue was afraid that he would play tricks, so he didn’t reveal the technique’s true name.

Powerful figures could not only deduce karma, but also Mystical Powers.

This was the meaning of a name.

A name was a symbol of an individual existence!

Han Jue asked, “Can you tell me how many Great Dao Divine Spirits there are in the Chaos and how many Great Dao Supremes exist?” he asked, seeing that the Foolish Sword Sage was not stubborn.

He knew too little about the Chaos. Previously, when he asked Great Sage Void Soul, this fellow had been suppressed for a long time and was also very unfamiliar with the world. As for the others, they were all weaker than Han Jue.

Foolish Sword Sage looked at him deeply and said, “There aren’t many Great Dao Divine Spirits, no more than twenty. Furthermore, they each guard a Chaotic Domain. After the Divine Robe Daoist died, a new Great Dao Divine Spirit will naturally be born or be supervised by other Great Dao Divine Spirits. As for the Great Dao Supremes, they’re extremely rare. There are no more than two of them that I know of. They are all hidden existences and rarely appear in billions of years.

“You don’t have to worry. Previously, the Holy Mother of Order attacked because she was giving the Divine Robe Daoist face. I’m the same. It’s just karma that I owed in the past.”

Han Jue narrowed his eyes and asked, “Is the Great Dao Supreme the strongest existence?”

Foolish Sword Sage said proudly, “That’s right. That’s the case in terms of cultivation realm. Legend has it that there are existences like the Chaotic Deities, but that’s only a legend. In any case, I’ve never seen them before. You don’t have to be too careful. After today’s battle ends, no one will dare to disturb the Heavenly Dao unless the Great Dao Divine Spirits join forces. However, there are also conflicts between the Great Dao Divine Spirits. How can they join forces? The Divine Robe Daoist and the Despair Dao Spirit were also enemies. They were just using the excuse of killing you.”

I see.

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. He was really afraid of falling into endless conflict.

He thought of another question, “There are also Great Dao Divine Spirits in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. Why don’t they control the nearby domains?”.

Foolish Sword Sage thought for a moment and replied, “Perhaps it’s a new one. Its cultivation is too weak. They are both Great Dao Divine Spirits. At the same realm, lifespan is proportional to strength. There are indeed Great Dao Divine Spirits hiding in the dark, but it’s only a small number.”

I see.

Perhaps the Seven Dao Sage had hidden his identity as a Great Dao Divine Spirit. He had grasped the power of seven Great Dao and was indeed extraordinary. Unfortunately, he had encountered Han Jue in advance.

The two of them chatted for a while more until the dream ended.

(Foolish Sword Sage has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 3 stars]

Han Jue was confused.

This fellow was really making friends with him?

Was he beaten into submission?

Han Jue asked silently, “Did the Foolish Sword Sage lie in his conversation with me just now?”

(300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[No]

Wow.

This was a great guy!

Han Jue also had a favorable impression of him.

Since the Foolish Sword Sage was not lying, the Heavenly Dao should be stable for some time.

Han Jue looked outside the Heavenly Dao.

With the Great Sage Void Soul’s attack, countless living beings of the Hatred Race were annihilated. Now, the Sages had sent disciples of the various sects to clean up the battlefield. They had returned to the 33rd Heaven to repair the Heavenly Dao with Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
