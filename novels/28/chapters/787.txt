Chapter 789 Late-Stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm!

“That chance of survival might be a hint of pity.” Han Yu sighed.

The woman in green did not understand.

Who was he referring to?

Han Yu turned around and walked towards the old tree. He smiled and said, “Continue cultivating. No matter what, you are happy and carefree now. Seize the time well and fight for that trace of life for yourself.”

The woman in green hurriedly followed and smiled. “Cultivation doesn’t matter to me. Being by your side all day long is my greatest satisfaction!” “I don’t need you to serve me. What have you done for me all these years?”

“That’s because you don’t need it, but my intentions are true.”

“Heh.”

Han Yu sat under the old tree and closed his eyes to cultivate.

As for the woman in green, he couldn’t be bothered.

Qin Ling’s encounter stimulated Han Yu.

He knew very well that if not for his ancestor, he would probably be a pawn in the mortal world. How could he be so free on Buzhou Divine Mountain that no one dared to disturb him?

He couldn’t let his ancestor down.

He also had to work hard to jump out of the chessboard and become a player!

Five thousand years later, Han Jue finally broke through

Late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm!

His Dharmic powers began to increase. The long-awaited comfort made him happy.

As he consolidated his cultivation, he checked his attributes list. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

[Name: Han Jue]

(Lifespan: 1,345,281 / 90,329,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,9 99]

(Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]

(Cultivation: Late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm (Perfect Sage)]

(Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]

(Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]

This breakthrough meant that his lifespan had tripled compared to before he used the Mystical Destiny Book!

Not bad! Not bad!

Han Jue was very satisfied.

His lifespan should increase by leaps and bounds when he reached the Great Dao Supreme Realm!

Han Jue looked forward to that day.

It took nearly 700,000 years to reach the late stage, and it would probably take a million years to reach the perfected stage!

There was still a long way to go.

It took Han Jue five hundred years to consolidate his cultivation.

He began to comprehend the Mystical Powers. He first raised his Sword Dao Mystical Powers to the extreme before cultivating the Grand Unity Aspect.

It took another three hundred years.

He had newly learned 300 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols, accumulating 1,149.

His strength had increased greatly!

At Han Jue’s realm, his Dharmic powers were endless. Therefore, the more Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols there were, the more Han Jue’s strength increased.

It seemed like he had only broken through a minor realm, but his strength had changed drastically. It had to be said that the Stellar Primordial Body was indeed powerful. It could control so many Dharma Idols at once.

Not only that, but every time he mastered a Fiendcelestial Dharma idol, the Fiendcelestial Qi would automatically condense. When Han Jue reached a certain extreme realm, the Primordial World in the depths of his soul might become another Chaos World.

There was a Chaotic Origin Stone in the Primordial World that could constantly increase the Chaotic Qi. However, the Primordial World itself was producing the nebulous Primordial Qi. At first, the two sides were small and did not affect each other. Now, the nebulous Primordial Qi occupied most of the Primordial World, and it was still gradually corroding the Chaotic Qi.

Apart from producing Chaotic Qi, the Chaotic Origin Stone could also transform into all things. It had the great creation of all living beings. If the Primordial World wanted to become a world of its own, it would need the Chaotic Origin Stone sooner or later.

Han Jue now felt that the Chaotic Origin Stone might affect the nebulous Primordial Qi, so he wanted to take it out after he found a place for the third Dao Field.

Creating a world in his body sounded wonderful and impressive, but in fact, it had created a weakness for him. Would the enemy attack him through this world?

Han Jue didn’t want to have a weakness.

Then, he began the simulation trial.

The target was still the Foolish Sword Sage.

A thousand Foolish Sword Sages!

Han Jue’s goal was to be absolutely invincible in the same realm.

To easily insta-kill many enemies no matter how there were.

He hoped that before he broke through to the Great Dao Supreme Realm, he could already challenge ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages or even more!

An hour later, Han Jue continued the second simulation trial.

It repeated the cycle. He wanted to train his combat ability in battle.

In the mysterious plane, there was an ocean below the sky. A majestic figure appeared at the end of the sea. Divine light billions of feet behind him was dazzling.

It was the Holy Mother of Order!

The Divine Robe Daoist descended from the sky and landed in front of the Holy Mother of Order. He cupped his hands and bowed.

“May I know why the Holy Mother called me here?” the Divine Robe Daoist asked with a smile. He didn’t seem to be affected by the Primordial Heavenly Prison and was as arrogant as ever.

The Holy Mother of Order said, “It’s about the Primordial Fiendcelestial. Not long ago, a living being consumed the Primordial Pill and obtained the power of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. It shook the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority of the Chaos. The divine authority was automatically on guard, so it gave birth to ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.

“The Divine Authority Generals have no intention of becoming independent. They will travel the Chaos to find the Primordial Fiendcelestial. At that time, don’t conflict with them.”

Divine Authority Generals?

The Divine Robe Daoist frowned. “How’s their cultivation?”

The Holy Mother of Order said, “It’s equivalent to ten thousand Great Dao Sages. This power can definitely dominate the Chaos. This is the power of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. Why is there peace in the Chaos? If you stop it, you will be judged to be harming the Chaos. Do you understand?”

The Divine Robe Daoist’s eyelids twitched.

Ten thousand Great Dao Sages!

Too ridiculous!

There might not even be a thousand Great Dao Sages in the Chaos. This was the accumulation of countless years.

This was enough to show how terrifying the power of the Great Dao Divine Authority was. It was enough to cleanse the Chaos.

The Divine Robe Daoist said, “Thank you for your reminder, Holy Mother. I’ll remember

it.”

The Holy Mother of Order asked, “Have you let go of your hatred for the Heavenly Dao?”

The Divine Robe Daoist smiled. “There’s no hatred. I’m just doing this for benefits. Since I can’t defeat him, I naturally have to let it go. Not only that, but I’ve also befriended him. In the future, we can rely on each other. It can be considered a blessing in disguise.”

The Holy Mother of Order said, “That’s right. Well done. In the Chaos, especially the Great Dao Sages, how can there be so many life and death grudges? Putting down the grudges and comprehending the Dao is what the Great Dao Sages should do. “The Chaos looks stable, but it can collapse at any time. The so-called Chaos is only a manifestation of the power of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority to occupy the Primordial Void. Perhaps other divine authorities will appear in the future to replace the Chaos and create a new name, just like the Darkness pursued by Life.”

The Divine Robe Daoist said disdainfully, “Life is stupid. They can’t rely on strength if they want to overturn the Chaos. They don’t even know what the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority is.”

“Yes, that’s all,” the Holy Mother of Order responded. The Divine Robe Daoist bowed and left, quickly disappearing.

Not long after, the space above the sea fluctuated violently and a figure appeared.

It was Laozi.

Laozi’s expression was indifferent. He looked at the Holy Mother of Order and said, “Holy Mother, can you deduce why the Primordial Pill failed?”

The Holy Mother of Order said, “Don’t you believe in indifference and non-emotion? Why are you asking about this?”
