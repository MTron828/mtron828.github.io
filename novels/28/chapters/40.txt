Chapter 42: Huang Jihao’s Challenge

“Challenge the Jade Pure Sect?”

Huang Jihao frowned and coldly said, “Such a desolate sect is not challenging at all!”

His tone was filled with disdain for the Jade Pure Sect.

A Raincoat Sect member hurriedly said, “Recently, a Deity Slaying Elder appeared in the Jade Pure Sect. He killed a Soul Formation expert with one strike. His strength is unfathomable!”

Hearing this, Huang Jihao couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.

“I’ve fought with the Sect Master and Great Grand Elder of the Jade Pure Sect. Their strength is average, and I’ve never heard of this Deity Slaying Elder. Don’t lie to me!”

Huang Jihao spoke in a low voice. His terrifying aura didn’t diminish in the slightest.

“I dare not lie!”

“It’s true. You can go out and ask around!”

“The Viridescent Nether Cult was destroyed because of this person!”

The other Raincoat Sect members said anxiously.

The four of them combined were not Huang Jihao’s match. They were afraid that he would attack them.

Huang Jihao’s eyes flickered. “Tell me the location of the Raincoat Sect first. I’ll challenge the Jade Pure Sect first, then the Raincoat Sect.”

The four Raincoat Sect members looked at each other.

In order to survive, they finally compromised.

After a while, Huang Jihao left.

The four Raincoat Sect members let out a long breath and collapsed onto their chairs.

“How strong is this guy?” One of them gritted his teeth.

Another person scolded. “It’s not important. What’s important is that I think there’s something wrong with this inn. Where’s the soundproofing and divine sense isolation?”

...

Jade Pure Sect.

Two years had passed since Li Qingzi left.

Han Jue was still at the sixth level of the Nascent Soul realm. With the help of Ye Sanlang’s pills, he was already close to the seventh level.

The Black Hell Chicken was already half a meter tall, but Han Jue had tested its skeletal age. It was still far from maturing.

One fine day, Chang Yue’er came to visit.

It had been many years since she had last seen the Black Hell Chicken. She couldn’t help but walk over and touch it.

“Itchy... itchy...” The Black Hell Chicken resisted and retreated.

Hearing its childish voice, Chang Yue’er was even more interested.

Han Jue couldn’t help but say, “Stop touching it. This is my precious mount. If you hurt it, can you afford to compensate me?”

“Tch, so be it if I have to compensate you! Using a chicken as a mount, you’re really something!”

Chang Yue’er pouted. Although she said that, her body was still very obedient. She turned around and came in front of him.

She sized up Han Jue and smiled. “Junior Han, I find your face pleasing to the eye every time I see it. I wonder how outstanding your parents are.”

Parents?

Oh.

They were nothing extraordinary.

Han Jue smiled in his heart.

All these years, Han Jue would occasionally think of his parents in this life.

More than a hundred years had passed. If they were still mortals, they would have been long dead.

That was good. It saved him a lot of trouble.

Han Jue’s parents in this life were not very close. When they abandoned Han Jue and fled, their blood ties ended.

If it were his parents in his previous life, they would definitely not give up on him.

Chang Yue’er continued, “I heard that Elder Guan is coming back. Have you heard of Elder Guan? He and our master entered the Jade Pure Sect together. However, 300 years ago, he offended the Vermillion Bird Sword Sect. In order to avoid suspicion, the Grand Elder secretly sent him out of the Great Yan Dynasty. Half a year ago, he used a spell to say that he was coming back and wanted to fight for the position of Sect Master.”

Han Jue shook his head.

He had never heard of such a thing.

He had never heard of such a person, either.

“It’s said that Elder Guan likes our master very much. He might become our master’s Dao companion,” Chang Yue’er continued.

Han Jue shrugged.

He was dreaming!

Fairy Xi Xuan didn’t allow her disciples to become Dao companions. How could she break the rules herself?

He asked, “Is that Elder Guan very strong?”

Chang Yue’er nodded and said, “It’s said that he obtained an opportunity outside the Great Yan and has already become a Soul Formation cultivator. This time, he has returned to lead the Jade Pure Sect to surpass the Vermilion Bird Sword Sect. The elders are all very happy. With one more Soul Formation cultivator in the Jade Pure Sect, we will have more confidence in dealing with the Raincoat Sect. The Great Grand Elder is also very happy, but the Sect Master is out and doesn’t know about this.”

Han Jue couldn’t help but mourn for Li Qingzi.

He had worked so hard for so many years, only to lose his position.

Just as Han Jue was about to ask more about Elder Guan, a line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.

[Detected bearer of Connate providence, checking its origin.]

Han Jue was stunned.

Another bearer of Connate providence?

Was the Jade Pure Sect really so lucky?

Why was it that there was always someone with a powerful background?

Han Jue hurriedly checked.

[Huang Jihao: Third level of the Soul Formation realm, an external elder of the Vermillion Bird Sword Sect. Born with the Heart of the Sword, he has an extremely high comprehension of the Sword Dao. Because of his unparalleled aptitude from a young age, he has developed a haughty attitude. In order to become stronger, he can give up everything.]

Huang Jihao!

F*ck!

Why was this fellow here?

Was he going to challenge the Jade Pure Sect?

Han Jue had a headache.

Couldn’t he just cultivate properly?

A choice notification appeared in front of Han Jue.

[The Jade Pure Sect faces Huang Jihao’s challenge. You have the following choices:]

[1: Order the entire sect to encircle and annihilate Huang Jihao and obtain victory. Your name will shake the world and you will obtain a fire attribute cultivation technique manual.]

[2: Secretly repel Huang Jihao without causing too much of a commotion. You can obtain a Numinous Treasure.]

Han Jue chose the second option.

Being high-profile was not his style.

Moreover, if he openly defeated Huang Jihao, the Vermilion Bird Sword Sect would definitely become enemies with the Jade Pure Sect.

Han Jue had yet to figure out Huang Jihao’s ranking in the Vermilion Bird Sword Sect. Even if he was the strongest, if the Vermilion Bird Sword Sect and the Raincoat Sect joined forces, the Jade Pure Sect would not be able to handle it.

“The Jade Pure Sect is still too weak.” Han Jue sighed.

He looked at Chang Yue’er and said, “Go back first. I have something to do.”

“What is it?”

“It’s not convenient to say.”

“Tch.” Chang Yue’er curled her lips and left.

She was still chatting happily but had been asked to leave. Anyone would feel disappointed.

After Chang Yue’er left, Han Jue began to use the simulation trial to search for Huang Jihao’s location.

At this moment, Huang Jihao was less than twenty kilometers away from the Jade Pure Sect.

He was walking very slowly.

Han Jue didn’t move immediately.

Hold on!

Let’s have a simulation trial battle!

Han Jue’s consciousness entered the simulation trial.

Five minutes later, he ended the simulation trial.

He frowned.

“He’s not bad at all.”

Han Jue took a deep breath and continued the simulation trial.

He couldn’t insta-kill the guy!

This guy is only at the third level of the Soul Formation Realm!

Han Jue changed his fighting style.

Two minutes later, the simulation ended.

Han Jue frowned again and muttered, “As expected of the innate Heart of the Sword. He can actually last two minutes against me.”

Han Jue was vexed.

The battle commotion was too loud. Two minutes was enough to attract many people.

The opponent was not easy to deal with. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He had no choice!

Even if it was difficult, he still had to go. When the battle reached the Jade Pure Sect, it would truly be earth-shattering!

...

In the forest, Huang Jihao slowly walked forward.

His expression was very calm, not the least bit nervous about the upcoming battle.

A figure suddenly appeared in front of him.

It was Han Jue.

He was wearing the Daoist robe of the Jade Pure Sect and his bearing was graceful. He was obviously not a mortal.

Huang Jihao glanced at him.

Ninth level of Foundation Establishment realm!

So weak!

But he was handsome.

[Huang Jihao has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 2 stars]

A line of words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue. He was stunned.

What the hell?
