Chapter 220 Han Jue’s Nature, Golden Crow Prodigy

“Can I stay here and cultivate unless the Heavenly Court is in trouble? I don’t want it to be too troublesome,” Han Jue said helplessly.

He really didn’t want to go to the Heavenly Court.

Wherever there were people, there would be trouble. The world was a network of relationships. Han Jue didn’t want to waste his energy on managing it.

Even if he chose to be alone, trouble would still come.

It wasn’t that staying away from trouble meant that there was no trouble.

Di Taibai asked in confusion, “Why are you so afraid? You don’t want to make a name for yourself, nor do you want to be a revered immortal?

“With the Heavenly Court and His Majesty backing you, no one in the Court will dare to provoke you, just like the Divine General.” It was fine if he didn’t mention the Divine General, but once he did, Han Jue panicked.

The Divine General was a pitiful laborer. Although he was majestic, he would also be severely injured.

Han Jue didn’t want to be a Divine General.

He shook his head and said, “I don’t want fame and fortune. I only want to live. The Heavenly Court has done me a favor, so I naturally have to repay it. I just hope that I can repay it at the critical moment. I’m willing to be the Heavenly Court’s guardian and not a Divine General who has to expand the territory.”

Di Taibai smiled helplessly.

This kid… Really cowardly! This was the first time he had encountered such a prodigy.

In all the worlds, which prodigy had such a temperament?

Di Taibai shook his head and said, “After the war between the Heavenly Court and the Demon Court ends, the Heavenly Court will choose ten prodigies to go to the Dao Sect to learn. There will be a Supreme Daoist preaching. His Majesty has given you a spot. Do you want to go?”

Han Jue frowned and said, “Forget it. Let others have it. My potential is already outstanding. If I give this opportunity to others, I can also help the Heavenly Court increase their combat strength.”

“This is a rare opportunity. There’s an Immortal Emperor’s Dao Attainment technique.”

“To me, it’s useful but not necessary.”

“Alright!”

Di Taibai frowned. He felt that Han Jue was too conceited. But on second thought, his potential indeed made him qualified to be conceited.

Di Taibai continued, “His Highness the Crown Prince has returned and is about to visit the True Dragon Race. Are you willing to go? The True Dragon Race has many divine weapons. You can choose one that you like.” “Thank you for your kind intentions. I don’t need it for the time being.”

Di Taibai was convinced.

This kid didn’t want to leave this mortal

world!

The two of them chatted for a while more before Di Taibai left.

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

Don’t disturb my Dao heart! Han Jue thought silently.

After Di Taibai left, Dao Comprehension Sword returned to the cave abode and asked curiously, “Why is that old man a little angry?”

“Who knows?” Han Jue said perfunctorily.

Dao Comprehension Sword Dao: “Master, can you teach me the second level of the Heavenly Sword Dao? I can’t defeat the Golden Crow. How infuriating!”

Han Jue rolled his eyes at her and said, “Your realm is too low.”

“But…”

“When you reach the Mahayana Realm, I’ll teach you step by step.”

“Really?”

“Mm.”

Dao Comprehension Sword immediately smiled in pleasant surprise.

Han Jue ignored her and focused on cultivating

He had to become an Immortal Emperor as soon as possible. Only then could he protect himself. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Heavenly Court, in a courtyard, in a stone pavilion.

The Heavenly Emperor was drinking tea as he asked casually, “Did he really say that?”.

Di Taibai bowed at the side and said helplessly, “That’s right. He just wants to stay in the mortal world and cultivate in peace.”

The Heavenly Emperor shook his head and laughed. “He’s already a Golden Immortal.”

“Ah? How is that possible!”

“How can my words be fake?” “Erm…”

Di Taibai was shocked, and his imagination began to run wild.

Han Jue hid his cultivation and refused to come to the Heavenly Court. Could there be something else?

The Heavenly Emperor said, “Don’t think too much. This child is indeed too cautious. This is also good. The Heavenly Court doesn’t lack a Grand Unity Golden Immortal for the time being. We lack an Immortal Emperor, an invincible Immortal Emperor, and even more so a Deity Realm cultivator!”

Di Taibai nodded and tried to calm down.

“How is Fang Liang?” The Heavenly Emperor continued to ask.

“Fang Liang is indeed worthy of being the Son of Heaven and Earth. He grows very quickly, even faster than the other Sons of Heaven and Earth. He can join this Dao Sect group.”

“Yes, it seems that Han Jue’s luck is not bad. He can bless his grand-disciples.” “The other disciples of the Hidden Sect of the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain are all good. Han Jue really knows how to choose disciples.”

“Great providence is attracted to each other. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be so many prodigies stepping on each other to ascend.” “True.”

The Heavenly Emperor didn’t say anything else. He waved his hand and gestured for Di Taibai to leave.

After a while, the Heavenly Emperor knocked on the table.

The space beside him began to ripple like water.

Twenty-seven years had passed in the mortal world.

Han Jue had completely learned the Golden Immortal chapter of the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique, but he hadn’t comprehended any new Mystical Power. Instead, his control over the Great Dao of Life and Death had increased.

The Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique was an Immortal Emperor cultivation technique. It wasn’t a problem for him to cultivate to the Immortal Emperor Realm. However, he had to seek a higher cultivation technique at a higher level. To Han Jue, the Immortal Emperor Realm was still very far away. He didn’t have to consider the reason for the cultivation technique for the time being

From his understanding, Immortal Emperors should be considered first-rate experts in the Immortal World.

On this day.

A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue.

(Detected bearer of Connate providence, check its origin.]

Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat. Was it another enemy?

He immediately checked. [Jiang Yi: Perfected Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm, born with a Chaotic Skeleton. He is thought to be the reincarnation of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. He is the invincible prodigy of the Golden Crow Divine Clan. Ever since he was born, he has been invincible among his peers. He has never been defeated. Because he knows that you are from the Heavenly Court, he specially came to find you.)

Eh?

Isn’t this Jiang Yi the one I met in the Sword Dao River?

Han Jue frowned. Why was this fellow looking for him?

His favorability was only 1 star!

Han Jue immediately checked Jiang Yi’s location and discovered that he was stopped in the void of the Scarlet Cloud World, as if waiting for him to appear. Han Jue used the simulation trial to see if he could defeat this fellow first.

Five minutes later.

Han Jue opened his eyes with a solemn expression.

He couldn’t kill Jiang Yi!

The two of them reached a draw!

Han Jue was shocked.

This was the first time he fought someone at the same cultivation level to a draw.

This fellow was amazing!

Han Jue thought for a moment and still went to see Jiang Yi in case he caused trouble.

Arriving in the void, Jiang Yi smiled when he saw him.

He wore a golden robe that was burning with True Sun Flame, and his white hair fluttered slightly. “Sima Yi, I didn’t expect you to be raising some members of our Golden Crow Divine Clan,” Jiang Yi said.

Han Jue asked warily, “You know them?”

Jiang Yi said, “Their potential is poor and they are siblings. I already guessed their identities, but it’s not important. I came to find you because I wanted to invite you to enter the Primordial Sword Domain together.”

“What’s the Primordial Sword Domain?”

“The Primordial Sword Domain was a world created by the Human School Sect Master of the Dao Sect. It absorbed the souls of the dead who had undergone the Immeasurable Calamity. Those souls couldn’t enter the cycle of reincarnation and could only be suppressed in the Primordial Sword Domain. Ever since the Sect Master of the Human School died, the Primordial Sword Domain has become an ownerless place. The inheritance of the Human School Sect Master is inside, especially his Sword Dao.”

“Thank you for your invitation, but I think I should pass. I don’t want to leave this place. I have to protect this world.” “With your potential, you only became a mortal world guardian? Is the Heavenly Court blind?”

“No, I asked for this,” Han Jue replied very politely. He was wary of Jiang Yi, afraid that he would suddenly attack.

Jiang Yi stared at him and sized him up carefully. Han Jue felt very uncomfortable being stared at.
