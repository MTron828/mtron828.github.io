Chapter 279 Divine Investiture Board, Demon Emperor’s Killing Intent

When no more Heavenly Soldiers came to report, the Numinous Palace quickly fell into chaos.

Some immortals suggested, some sighed, and some cursed angrily. At this moment, they had lost the solemnity and steadiness of immortals.

“Hmph!”

The Heavenly Emperor suddenly snorted coldly, like a hammer striking the hearts of all the immortals.

All the immortals shut up and did not dare to speak again. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

In the Heavenly Court, the Heavenly Emperor had absolute authority!

“The Heavenly General is about to return. All of you, hold on for a while longer. The Demon Court will definitely be even more anxious than us at this moment. The Heavenly Court can’t afford to lose, and neither can the Demon Court. Instead of regretting, why don’t you think about how to kill the enemy!” the Heavenly Emperor said casually.

In the past, the battles of the four great factions had always been in their eyes. Now, it was different. The Demon Emperor had already gone mad. If the Heavenly Court lost, they would definitely be massacred.

Furthermore, it was the early stage of the Immeasurable Calamity now! Di Taibai asked, “What about the mortal world?”

“Activate the Divine Investiture Board and announce to the heavens. Tell the mortals that if they can kill their way to the Heavenly Court from the mortal world, they can become immortals and gods. They can fight freely in the mortal world. In addition, fuse the Heavenly Dao Tablet of the Heavenly Court with the main Heavenly Dao.”

The Heavenly Emperor instructed with a solemn expression.

The immortals were in an uproar.

The Heavenly Emperor was going all out!

Above the Reroll World, in the void.

Han Jue looked down at the Reroll World and raised his arms. He spread out his Dharmic powers, wanting to cover the entire world.

After doing so, he wanted to suck the entire Reroll World into his Primordial World.

However, a mysterious force isolated him from the outside world, preventing him from dragging the Reroll World into his Primordial World. He couldn’t even move it.

Heavenly Dao!

Han Jue retracted his Dharmic powers and sighed.

As expected, it did not work.

If it could, so many mortal worlds would not have been destroyed. Han Jue fell into a dilemma again. What should he do?

Give up on the Reroll World?

No!

He would curse when he returned.

Han Jue came to the Connate Cave Abode.

He had more than seven trillion years of life. He could try his best to curse the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor.

At least let this fellow mess with him in a short period of time!

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing

Ten days later, Han Jue’s eyes started to bleed.

A month later.

Han Jue’s face was covered in blood, but he still didn’t see the notification that the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor had been successfully cursed.

Damn it!

So fierce?

Han Jue didn’t believe in failure and continued cursing

He insisted on cursing.

Another month passed.

Han Jue’s hands started to crack and blood oozed out. He had already lost ten million years of his lifespan.

Finally.

(Your enemy Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor has suffered damage to his Dao heart due to your curse. Fortunately, the Great Freedom Qi has healed him.)

Han Jue widened his eyes and wanted to vomit blood.

What was the Great Freedom Qi?

Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and wiped the blood off his face. He was extremely depressed.

He took out the Heavenly Dao Token and asked Di Taibai.

“Great Freedom Qi? That’s the legendary Qi. It’s said to be a Mystical Power created by a Sage. In the current world, only the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor has this Mystical Power. I’m not sure, either,” Di Taibai replied.

He added, “You want to target the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor, right? I advise you to give up. He’s almost invincible among the Immortal Emperors and can enter the Deity Realm at any time. Now that the Heavenly Court is in danger, the Immortal Gods are prepared to give up the mortal worlds.”

Han Jue frowned. He had a bad feeling.

His backing was about to collapse?

Han Jue asked, “Can the Heavenly Court survive?”

Di Taibai smiled. “Don’t worry. How many Immeasurable Calamities has the Heavenly Court endured? It’s just very dangerous now. We can’t care about the mortal worlds. If they’re gone, we can always create new ones.”

Han Jue felt inexplicably sad.

It was unknown if he felt sad for the Heavenly Court or for the mortals.

After severing the connection, Han Jue called the Black Hell Demon Lord in.

Then, he used his essence soul to lead him to the netherworld and quickly entered the Hidden Sect Island.

“Create the formation first. Tell my clone when it’s done.”

Han Jue pointed at the Heavenly Puppet.

The Black Hell Demon Lord accepted the order, and Han Jue’s essence soul jumped back into the mortal world.

Han Jue opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief.

He had already prepared for the worst. If he couldn’t protect the Reroll World, he would protect the Hidden Sect.

No matter what, he couldn’t lose his life for the sake of the Reroll World.

Dao Comprehension Sword asked worriedly, “Master, are we escaping?”

She had heard others say that the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor was a supreme expert of the Golden Crow Divine Clan, an existence that had forced the Heavenly Emperor to personally take action.

Han Jue said, “Probably. You always felt that I was lying to you in the past. Now, a powerful enemy is here.” Dao Comprehension Sword said seriously, “No matter where Master goes, I’m willing to follow. It’s fine even if I have to suffer.”

Han Jue smiled helplessly.

Come to think of it, the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor was the first enemy who truly made him want to escape.

The previous enemies were either insta-killed by him or killed before they could even come.

“Myriad worlds, listen up. Today, the Heavenly Court will open the Divine Investiture Board. If all living beings can reach above the Nine Heavens and find the four Heavenly Gates of the North, South, East, and West, they can all become gods or immortals. From today onwards, tens of thousands of mortal worlds can fight. Immortals and gods will no longer control the mortal worlds!”

A loud voice resounded throughout the world. It was not only the Reroll World but also the other mortal worlds.

Han Jue was stunned.

Giving up just like that? Han Jue felt that the Heavenly Court was a little heartless, but on second thought, this might be a good thing.

At the very least, the Demon Court would know that the mortal worlds were already useless to the Heavenly Court. Destroying the mortal worlds to threaten the Heavenly Court was futile.

This was only a good aspect. The cruel thing was that there would definitely be demons devouring the mortal worlds.

Wait!

Han Jue seemed to sense something. His expression changed and he disappeared into the cave abode.

He arrived in the void and wrapped the Reroll World with his Dharmic powers.

The huge Reroll World began to move!

The Heavenly Dao power that protected the Reroll World had vanished!

Could it be related to the Heavenly Court giving up on the mortal worlds?

Great! Han Jue thought in surprise.

Above the endless thunderclouds was a divine hall ten thousand feet tall. This divine hall did not have a ceiling. A huge three-legged Golden Crow occupied it. The True Sun Flame burned like an imprisoned sun.

It was the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor.

A ball of demonic aura pierced through the thundercloud and flew in front of him, transforming into a huge face. It was the face of the Demon Emperor. “The Heavenly Court has already given up on the mortal worlds. You can continue to annex the Reroll World!” the Demon Emperor instructed with a murderous tone.

The Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor opened his eyes and said, “You don’t have to tell me. I will go regardless. But why do you hate a mortal world so much?”

The Demon Emperor replied, “My son died in that world. I can’t read it, either. Furthermore, the son of the Heavenly Emperor is in this world. Even the Black Hell Demon Lord betrayed me. Therefore, this world must be destroyed!”

The Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor snorted. “Don’t worry. I’ll return soon. At that time, I’ll make that kid cry and beg for mercy!”

He gritted his teeth at the thought of Han Jue inviting the Heavenly Emperor to help.

The two bastards of his race were also there!

All of them had to die!

“That’s good. After this tribulation ends, I’ll give you a Purple Firmament spot!” The Demon Emperor vanished after saying that.

The Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor’s eyes flickered. It was unknown what he was thinking.
