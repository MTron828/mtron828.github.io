Chapter 1002 Invincible

Formless World naturally did not refuse Han Huang’s challenge. They were all peerless geniuses who wanted to reach the peak of the world, so they naturally would not avoid it.

The other geniuses also began to find opponents.

Dao Sovereign challenged Huang Zuntian.

Guan Bubai challenged the Great Heavenly God King.

Murong Qi challenged the Universe Sage King.

The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial fought Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven.

This lineup reversed the spectators’ opinion at Ten Absolute City, and they began to praise the Hidden Sect.

They could have ganged up, but they insisted on fighting one-on-one.

This was integrity!

“As expected of the Hidden Sect!”

“Who said that the Hidden Sect is suppressing others?”

“How powerful is the Divine Might Heavenly Sage? Does he need such a method?”

“Tsk tsk, it must have been arranged by the Heavenly Sage. Actually, it’s not the Hidden Sect’s fault. Who asked their geniuses to be so strong? In my opinion, the Heavenly Sage still cares too much about his reputation. If it were me, I would directly make my disciple the Eternal Peak!”

“This is going to be good. But what is thi place? It can actually withstand the Dharmic powers of ten peerless geniuses?”

Dao Sovereign used the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority and summoned the Chaotic River of Destiny. The river meandered and wrapped around his body, covering ten million miles of land, forcing the other geniuses to retreat. The Ultimate God of Punishment also split the sky into five pieces, corresponding to five battlefields.

“Hahaha, Life Lord, I know you. The Calamity Life Controller is indeed impressive. You can even take in Li Daokong. However, do you know what the price of poaching from the Hidden Sect is?” Dao Sovereign said arrogantly. He had long wanted to say this, but it was not appropriate previously.

Huang Zuntian thought to himself, Actually, I’m also from the Hidden Sect. We’re all on the same side.

However, it was not appropriate. Currently, Master had no intention of revealing his cards. In that case, he had to continue acting. The more he acted, the better!

“Great Dao Providence Divine Authority? It’s indeed impressive, but you have it, and so do

I!”

Huang Zuntian leaped and laughed wantonly. He opened his arms, and the black patterns on his forehead quickly turned into a black aura that enveloped his entire body.

In the courtyard of Ten Absolute City.

Azure Heaven Mystic’s expression turned ugly. Including him, there were already three existences who had grasped the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority!

The other two began to compete for the Eternal Peak, but he could only watch the show here.

Azure Heaven Mystic was furious.

Dao Sovereign was also stunned. He didn’t expect Huang Zuntian to also control the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority.

Huang Zuntian’s eyes suddenly turned black. His crown shattered and his long hair fluttered as if he was possessed by the Devil Master. A terrifying aura erupted, moving Dao Sovereign.

This aura was stronger than all the geniuses Dao Sovereign had encountered before! They were clearly not on the same level!

“Very good! This is more satisfying!”

Dao Sovereign laughed loudly. Shadows rushed out from the Chaotic River of Destiny. They were experts of the past and present, all warlike.

On the other side, the other geniuses also fought angrily. The ground of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World shook violently. The ground kept shattering, as if the end of the world had arrived!

Han Huang and Formless World fought with their bodies. Both sides had Dharmic powers. They were like two beams of light that constantly moved and expanded in the world. They were fearless. Wherever they passed, all existences were reduced to dust. Even the sky was torn apart by sinister spatial cracks.

The battle between the two was the most eye-catching. Both sides had outstanding looks and temperament among the geniuses. Their strength was even more so. Along the way, the two of them were domineering and unstoppable.

An invincible person fought another invincible person!

Han Huang’s aura was like a rainbow. He kept using the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm, causing the world to collapse and the clouds to tear apart like smoke.

Formless World’s robes fluttered as thirty-six jade beads of different colors surrounded him. It was as if he was wrapped in seven-colored light. Facing the domineering Han Huang, he was calm and could attack while dodging the Mystical Power.

If Han Huang was the invincible War God, Formless World would be more like an emperor who ruled the gods. His every move had the vast aura of an emperor, as if he could resolve all the Dao techniques in the world.

The battles between Guan Bubai, the Great Heavenly God King, Murong Qi, the Universe Sage King, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, and Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven were also difficult to determine.

This competition was destined to not end anytime soon!

In the hall.

Han Jue watched with relish, while Han Ling was a little nervous.

“Father, this Formless World is so powerful. Can Second Brother avenge Eldest Brother and the others?” Han Ling asked with a voice transmission. She couldn’t let the mighty figures hear this lest they thought too much.

Han Jue replied, “Formless World is indeed impressive, but it’s not enough to defeat your second brother.”

What a joke. The Primordial Fiendcelestial had a greater origin than the Formless Transcendent Deity. How could he lose to its successor!

Formless World clearly still had hidden methods, but so did Han Huang. Until now, Han Huang had not used the power of the Primordial Fiendcelestial.

As for the others, Han Jue felt that they had no hope. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Unless Formless World perished with Han Huang and gave others a chance to benefit.

The scene of the ten extreme geniuses fighting with all their might was indeed spectacular. It far exceeded all the previous battles. Seeing this, everyone in Ten Absolute City exclaimed. Some living beings even shouted the name of the prodigy they worshiped.

At this moment…

In the courtyard.

Azure Heaven Mystic was watching the battle when a voice sounded in his mind, “Come… come…”

Hearing this, Azure Heaven Mystic subconsciously looked around. Everyone was watching the battle and no one summoned him.

No!

Voice transmission?

Azure Heaven Mystic frowned. He was about to ignore it when he discovered that the Dharmic powers in his body had suddenly frozen.

His expression changed. Just as he was about to speak, his expression returned to normal and his eyes became extremely empty.

He turned around and left quietly.

Zhao Shuangquan glanced at him and thought that he was agitated, so he did not care and continued watching.

Ji Xianshen noticed his departure. He followed him after hesitating for a moment.

No matter what, he had brought Azure Heaven Mystic here. Although they were not master and disciple anymore, their relationship was still there.

Originally, Ji Xianshen thought that Azure Heaven Mystic had only been agitated and wanted to go back and rest. He did not expect him to leave the city directly.

Ji Xianshen suddenly realized that something was wrong

“Although Azure Heaven Mystic is arrogant, he won’t forcefully enter the eternal battlefield. What’s going on?”

Ji Xianshen frowned. He hesitated for a moment but still decided to follow.

Boom

Han Huang descended from the sky and collapsed an area of billions of kilometers. Countless rocks rose and the Formless World’s figure flashed, constantly rising into the sky and leaving his opponent behind.

Han Huang looked up and mocked. “How long are you going to hide?”

Formless World looked down at him and said, “I’m looking at your limit. It’s nothing much. Since you can’t wait, prepare to be eliminated!”

The 36 jade beads suddenly gathered and condensed into a seven-colored sword. Formless World raised the sword and slashed. Sword Qi swept through the world.

Han Huang did not dodge. He raised his palm and struck. The Divine Might Great Heaven Palm directly split his sword Qi into two.

However, the remaining two sword Qi shattered, turning into countless sword Qi that descended from the sky and bombarded the ground.

Han Huang attacked with both palms, scattering the sword Qi one after another. He soared into the sky as he stared at his opponent.

Formless World was stunned. For some reason, Han Huang’s gaze made his heart palpitate.

“Impossible! I’m invincible… Even the supreme existence who transcended the Chaos said that…”

Formless World’s eyes became firm as he revealed a strange smile.
