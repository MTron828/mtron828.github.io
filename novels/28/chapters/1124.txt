Chapter 1125 Endless Era, Supreme Creation

The powerful Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger pierced through the power of darkness. The Dark Forbidden Lord wanted to block it, but the layers of dark power he created were all pierced through. In the end, a huge hole appeared in his body. The blank domain behind tore open a long black crack. Just the width was enough to contain the Chaos. Thousands of mighty figures were shocked.

This was even more shocking than Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s huge hand!

How strong was the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?

The Dark Forbidden Lord was not dispersed. He roared, “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, you actually have such power! However, it’s impossible to kill me! A Dao Creator is undying and indestructible!”

Han Jue snorted. “If I can’t kill you, I’ll suppress you forever!”

With that, a vast Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal appeared above the Dark Forbidden Lord. It was ten thousand times larger than the Chaos and descended with a world-destroying divine might.

The Dark Forbidden Lord wanted to dodge, but strange lightning appeared around him. It was like a prison that wrapped around him, not allowing him to escape.

Under the excited expressions of thousands of mighty figures and the anticipation of all living beings, the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal crushed the Dark Forbidden Lord into ashes. His soul struggled with all its might in the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal.

“Impossible… Impossible… Why do you have such power! Why don’t you fight since you’re so strong? Why keep a low profile…” the Dark Forbidden Lord roared hoarsely. He seemed to be at the end of the line.

Han Jue’s voice sounded, “The Dao of cultivation is not about competition. I’m only fighting for myself, not external objects.”

These words left a deep impression on the mighty figures present.

Under the gaze of all living beings, the Dark Forbidden Lord was sealed by the Ultimate

Origin Heaven Seal. Han Jue retracted it

through the air, and the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal disappeared. Four jade pendants

appeared in his hand.

With a casual throw, the four jade pendants

transformed into four Dao Creators.

Chaotic Consciousness, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable,

Formless Transcendent Deity, Yin-Yang

Purity Nirvana Deity.

They had been sealed previously, but they didn’t lose their will. They had been watching the battle. From the point of view of the Dark Forbidden Lord, the Chaos was so weak, but they didn’t expect that with Han Jue’s appearance, everything would be reversed.

Even the four Dao Creators were shocked. They still did not come back to their senses after reviving.

Han Jue looked down at the shattered Chaos

and said, “The Chaos has been broken. The old order should pass. In that case, the Endless Era can begin.”

He waved his right hand and the Chaotic Space shattered. Heaven and earth scattered into the blank domain. In an instant, it was as if a force swept through the blank domain from the Chaos and spread endlessly. The mighty figures clearly felt that the blank

domain had changed. It was no longer as heavy as before. They were as relaxed as if they were in the Chaos. Endless Spirit Qi filled Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

the blank domain.

The Endless Era had arrived!

It’s over?

The mighty figures looked at each other in

disbelief.

The living beings scattered in all directions

began to cheer.

“Thank you for your help, Divine Might Heavenly Sage!”

The Formless Transcendent Deity was the first to bow to Han Jue. The other three Dao Creators followed suit.

Thousands of mighty figures knelt down to Han Jue and looked at him fanatically.

If not for Han Jue, the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity would have ended with the destruction of the Chaos and they

would have died.

Han Jue said, “The dead are already gone. The new era needs order and transcendence. From now on, you will control the prelude of the

Endless Era. The other three Dao Creators will assist and confer the creation of this Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. As for…

“As for Primordial Despair, he has killed too many people and is sealed outside the order with the Dark Forbidden Lord. He will never

transcend.”

Primordial Despair let out a shrill cry of

despair as it turned into dust under the gazes of all living beings.

Han Huang frowned and turned his head away, unable to bear it.

Han Ling noticed her second brother’s expression and had a guess. Her eyes revealed

pity.

“The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity has ended.”

After Han Jue finished speaking, his body that

was shining with divine light gradually faded

until it disappeared. The Chaotic Consciousness, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity looked at the

Formless Transcendent Deity enviously. The Formless Transcendent Deity was glad. He was also grateful to Han Jue. He had bet correctly. Han Jue was so magnanimous. The Formless Transcendent Deity began to teach everyone. He condensed the creation of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity and prepared to reward it.

The so-called creation was actually the power of the Chaos itself. The Chaos no longer existed and its power would be eaten by them.

In the third Dao Field.

Han Jue returned and was surrounded by

Women.

“Husband, you’re really too powerful!” “That Dark Forbidden Lord is far inferior to

you.” “Are there realms among Dao Creators?”

“Can you revive those dead living beings?”

“I knew that you could easily kill the Dark Forbidden Lord. Don’t let him revive. If have a way in the future, you still have to

completely kill him and eliminate future trouble.”

you

All the women were excited. Even Xing Hongxuan, who already knew that Han Jue was invincible, was still very excited.

They finally felt Han Jue’s power after witnessing the Dark Forbidden Lord’s power. Han Jue seemed to have used the help of all

the living beings in the Chaos, but the power he used was clearly many times stronger. They couldn’t be compared at all. Han Jue smiled. “Alright, the calamity is over.

The next Endless Era will be a new era. Everything is unknown. If you’re so happy, you can go out for a walk.”

With that, he walked into the Daoist temple. The women agreed immediately and left the Dao Field under Xing Hongxuan’s lead to visit Han Huang and the others.

Shan’e and the Ten Divine Stars were also

allowed out by Han Jue’s clone, making them cheer.

Inside the Daoist temple.

Han Jue sat on the lotus throne and opened

his right palm. Two auras appeared, one black and one purple.

The black was the Ninth Chaos’ remnant soul, and the purple was Primordial Despair. Han Jue actually didn’t hate the Ninth Chaos.

It was a pity that such an expert died like this, so he chose to throw the Ninth Chaos into the

Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison. With the cultivation of the Ninth Chaos, it

would probably take billions of years to completely enslave him.

As for Primordial Despair, in order for him to live better, Han Jue decided to let him reincarnate and awaken his intelligence in the cycle of reincarnation.

Han Jue blew gently, and the purple Qi in his palm blew away. He looked at the blank domain. Although there were only remnants of the Chaos in the

world of the blank domain, he could already see the torrent of history of a vast era surging over. It was unstoppable.

…

The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended.

The Dark Forbidden Lord and his subordinate, the Evil Fiend Primordial Despair, shattered the Chaos. Then, they were sealed by the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage. After that, the Endless Era arrived.

This past was forever engraved in the long river of history. It was passed down from generation to generation.

The Dao Creator Realm became the highest goal of cultivation.

The Divine Might Heavenly Sage became the leader of the Creators, the supreme existence

that all beings believed in.
