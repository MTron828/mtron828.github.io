Chapter 1176 Lord in a Higher Position

Han Jue thought that might be true.

The blank domain could indeed give birth to a will. His system was the blank domain’s

Creation Will, but that will had once told him that the blank domain itself was no longer under its control. In the future, it might resist him or even reject him.

In that case, the white-haired man’s identity could be confirmed.

Apart from the will avatar of the blank domain, Han Jue couldn’t think of anyone who could threaten him for the time being.

Unless another Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial or stronger existence was born in the future.

“Since it’s in the future, let’s just wait,” Han Jue said calmly.

The Ninth Chaos nodded.

The dream ended.

Han Jue continued to look at the blank domain and the experiences of all living beings, as if he was experiencing them. Even the Creator Lord liked to imagine.

Han Jue grew bored after some time passed. He prepared to extend his seclusion period.

A billion years!

In any case, he had already faded in the eyes of all living beings. No matter how long he entered seclusion, it could not change anything. He wasn’t interested in interfering with all living beings.

Transcendent Divine Hall.

The five Dao Creators gathered in the hall. They were the Formless Transcendent Deity, the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, the Chaotic Consciousness, and the Ninth Chaos.

They looked at the door side by side. A strong light filled the entrance of the hall, and they could not see everything outside. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Who will become a Dao Creator first, Han Huang or the Dao Ancestor?”

The Chaotic Consciousness smiled. After

putting down their ambitions, their

relationship had softened greatly in the past

billions of years. They returned to their previous state and smiled at the rise and fall of

all living beings.

The Ninth Chaos said indifferently, “It should be the Dao Ancestor. He had hope before, but…”

He did not finish. The four Dao Creators knew what he meant.

The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity sneered. “I think it’s Han Huang. The Dao Ancestor might not be able to compare if the three Primordial Fiendcelestials join forces.”

The Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity believed that the Dao Ancestor would succeed first.

A Dao Creator could not deduce other Dao

Creators, so they didn’t know who would become a Dao Creator. Now, in their eyes, the

Dao Ancestor and Han Huang could both succeed. It was just a question of who would succeed first.

Then, the five Dao Creators began to discuss who else could become a Dao Creator.

After a long time.

A terrifying aura descended, shaking the

Transcendent Divine Hall.

A figure walked into the hall in the strong light.

It was the Dao Ancestor.

The Dao Ancestor wore a Daoist robe and had white hair. He held a horsetail whisk in his hand and a thread formed by the three thousand Great Dao in the other.

Looking at him, other than the Ninth Chaos,

the four Dao Creators were a little stunned.

They did not expect to be wrong. Only the Ninth Chaos was right.

The Dao Ancestor stopped in front of them and cupped his hands. “I’m Hong Jun. Greetings,

fellow Daoists.”

Fellow Daoists!

The five Dao Creators sighed. Yes, they would be on the same level in the future.

Another terrifying aura descended before they could speak. Han Huang walked into the hall.

He wore a green robe and no longer had any hostility. His temperament was restrained, and it was difficult to associate him with the

Primordial Fiendcelestial.

The Dao Ancestor looked at him and smiled. “You’re here, fellow Daoist.”

Han Huang smiled faintly. “You’re indeed faster. To us, it doesn’t matter who’s faster as long as it’s the same day.”

The Dao Ancestor smiled and nodded.

The two of them did not have a confrontational

atmosphere, as if they had been good friends for many years.

The Formless Transcendent Deity smiled and

asked, “Where are Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian?”

Han Huang smiled and said, “They’re still consolidating their cultivation. They sent me in advance to meet you.”

From today onwards, he would officially step

into the circle of Dao Creators!

He looked calm, but he was still a little excited

inside.

He looked around and asked curiously, “Where’s the Lord?”

The Dao Creators were all here. Why didn’t his

father come?

Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable smiled. “This is the domain of a Dao Creator.

As for your father, he’s not a Dao Creator. He has reached a higher realm.”

Han Huang was stunned before shaking his head and laughing.

He was not surprised. Instead, he felt that it made sense to obtain the true answer.

The seven Dao Creators sat down and began to

discuss the Dao.

Every Dao Creator walked a different path. It

was beneficial to discuss the Dao with each

other.

The news of the Dao Ancestor and the three Primordial Fiendcelestials becoming Dao Creators quickly spread throughout the Endless

Era.

Han Jue also ended his seclusion. This seclusion lasted for a billion years.

He opened his eyes and sighed as he looked at

the rapidly expanding Primordial Chaos and Chaos.

It was a little earlier than the future he predicted. The future kept changing, and Han Jue could also follow the changes. However, he was busy cultivating in the past first billion

years.

He looked carefully. So the future only suffered a change because the Primordial Chaos and Chaos were catalyzed by the basic rules.

It was unknown if it was a coincidence or the

Endless Era’s creation, but the basic rules were drilled into their Great Dao Worlds when they condensed seven Supreme Rules, making them stronger.

The current them were stronger than the Chaotic Consciousness and the others when they had just entered the Dao Creator, but not that much stronger. Han Jue looked at the future. The third Dao

Creator of the Endless Era would be born in four billion years. There was no doubt that it would be Han Ling.

The sequence changed a little after that. It actually became Han Liang.

He was indeed blessed with the support of two

Dao Creators.

Han Jue stood up and walked out of the Daoist

temple.

At this moment, the Dao Companions were gathered in Xing Hongxuan’s Daoist temple to celebrate Han Huang’s successful attainment of

the Dao. They didn’t notice him.

As long as Han Jue didn’t reveal his aura, no

one could sense him.

Qingluan’er sighed. “Huang’er is really powerful, and his personality has changed greatly. I didn’t expect the most rebellious child to become the most sensible.”

Chang Yue’er smiled. “Han Tuo will be here soon.”

“Next is Ling’er.”

“Probably. In any case, Qing’er and Yunjin

won’t have a chance.”

“Haha, it’s fine if they don’t become Dao Creators. Who dares to bully them?” “That grandson of mine, Han Liang, has a possibility.”

“Speaking of my grandson, Heavenly Venerate Xun and Chu Xiaoqi are at odds. As his grandmother, do you want to resolve it?” The women discussed passionately. Xing Hongxuan’s temperament was the most outstanding. Her identity as the Prominent Divine Dream Mother had absorbed too many faiths. She was already a god.

Even Li Yao, who had the most outstanding cultivation, was a little ordinary in front of her.

Han Jue smiled and said, “I think Li Yao can also become a Dao Creator.”

The women looked at him in surprise and immediately surrounded him. His arms were instantly pulled each way.

He was pushed to sit down and rubbed all over.

The women were naturally happy after not seeing him for a billion years.

Li Yao blinked and asked, “How long will it take me to succeed?”

It was really difficult to condense the Supreme

Rules. She couldn’t see how long it would take.

Han Jue smiled and said, “I’ll guide you later.” Li Yao was pleasantly surprised. Her gaze seemed to melt him.

Dao Comprehension Sword asked excitedly, “What about me? What about me?” “You? Stop dreaming,” Han Jue said bluntly, causing her pretty face to collapse.
