Chapter 774 New and Ancient, Daoist Destiny

Red Fate finally stopped flattering him after entering the Grand Primordium Domain. Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

He had thought that the Chaotic Fiendcelestials were all arrogant and bloodthirsty. He didn’t expect there to be an existence like Red Fate.

Red Fate was not like a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, but more like a human.

The Grand Primordium Domain was wrapped in a layer of fire. The interior was extremely vast, not the least inferior to the Immortal World. The blue sky, white clouds, green mountains, and rivers formed a world of their own.

However, Han Jue didn’t sense the aura of living beings.

The two of them flew all the way and soon arrived at a huge palace that towered into the clouds. The door alone was a million feet tall. There were two huge cauldrons in front of the door, each with a stick of incense. Sand smoke filled the air and transformed into clouds that enveloped the entire world.

A giant stood in front of the door. He wore bronze heavy armor and his true appearance could not be seen.

He said, “Fiendcelestials, please enter the hall. Master is already waiting inside.”

Han Jue and Red Fate entered the hall.

Han Jue felt a powerful aura and secretly felt pity.

How good would it be if his clone could also use the simulation trial to detect the vicinity?

The hall was blank. The space was filled with white light as if it was an independent space. There were meditation cushions in front of him, each ten thousand feet away. They were all facing the same direction.

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial!

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial wore a black robe. Its head was like black flames and its true appearance could not be seen. It was mysterious and terrifying.

More than twenty Chaotic Fiendcelestials were already sitting down. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Han Jue and Red Fate looked at each other and sat down on neighboring mats.

“This is Fellow Daoist Han Jue from the Heavenly Dao. The younger generation is truly impressive. He killed the Despair Dao Spirit and defeated the Divine Robe Daoist. Fourteen Great Dao Sages died to him. He has fought for us Chaotic Fiendcelestials.” The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial suddenly looked at Han Jue and said.

With that said, Han Jue felt many Sage Senses sweep over him.

Han Jue replied politely, “I had no choice. Compared to you, I’m still far inferior.”

He did not deny it. Keeping a low profile would only make him look hypocritical.

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial sighed. “Back then, the three thousand Fiendcelestials stood in the Chaos. What a grand occasion. The Chaotic Races trembled in fear and despair at our birth. Unfortunately, Pangu was heartless and slaughtered his own kind to attain the Dao. I still feel hatred when I think of it now. Fellow Daoist Han, you have to control the Heavenly Dao well. Don’t let Pangu have the opportunity to revive!”

The other Fiendcelestials sighed. Most of them had ancient voices and were probably Chaotic Fiendcelestials who had survived the Pangu Calamity.

Seeing that they were chatting, Han Jue didn’t reply and listened quietly.

He wasn’t a true Chaotic Fiendcelestial and would not befriend these people.

He was here to hear what these Fiendcelestials wanted to do to him!

Red Fate sent a voice transmission to Han Jue, “The Chaotic Fiendcelestials are divided into ancient and new. The ones speaking now are all ancient beings. You and I can just listen to the newcomers. If our cultivation levels are inferior to theirs, it will be very difficult for us to make decisions.”

Han Jue replied, “I understand.”

The Chaotic Fiendcelestials of the ancient group talked about the past, like big shots reminiscing about the past.

How pretentious.

From the looks of it, he still had to wait for a while.

Han Jue was also curious about how many Chaotic Fiendcelestials were hidden in the current Chaos.

Several days later, the Foolish Sword Sage also arrived.

He was not surprised to see Han Jue. Instead, he found a mat close to him and sat down. He started to chat with Han Jue with a voice transmission.

This fellow was very excited. He said that after his battle with Han Jue ended, he returned to comprehend the Sword Dao and his strength increased again. He wouldn’t be in such a sorry state if he faced Han Jue again.

However, he knew his limits and didn’t challenge him again.

The Foolish Sword Sage finally fell silent after chatting for half a day.

He also belonged to the ancient group, but he did not participate in the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s conversation.

Perhaps it was Han Jue’s imagination, but the fiendcelestials seemed to reject the Foolish Sword Sage.

“Fellow Daoist, do you know Sage Fated Secrets?”

A voice suddenly floated into his ears.

Han Jue glanced over. A gray-robed old Daoist was staring at him.

Han Jue replied, “I’ve heard of him, but I don’t know him. He had already died when I attained the Dao.”

The gray-robed old Daoist sent a voice transmission, “That’s true. My useless disciple was defeated by the Dark Forbidden Lord and abandoned by the Heavenly Dao Sages.”

Disciple?

Han Jue was secretly surprised.

Daoist Destiny!

Han Jue remembered. In the past, he had deduced that Daoist Destiny and Nüwa were plotting something. However, after Sage Fated Secrets died, Daoist Destiny had never appeared again.

Han Jue replied, “My condolences. The current Heavenly Dao is no longer the original Heavenly Dao. Your disciple is not the only Sage who died.”

“That’s true. I don’t blame you. I just want to befriend you. I’m very curious about you.”

“It’s naturally a good thing to have another friend.”

“That’s right.”

The two of them began to exchange pleasantries.

(Daoist Destiny has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 2 stars]

Han Jue didn’t mind. It was all an act.

However, Daoist Destiny was sincere. Han Jue had such a valiant battle record that people would think that he was not to be trifled with. However, Han Jue appeared kind. This magnanimity made Daoist Destiny feel very comfortable. In the following years, fiendcelestials arrived one after another. More than three hundred years passed.

The Grand Primordium Hall finally closed. Han Jue counted. There were a total of 67 Chaotic Fiendcelestials, more than he had imagined.

However, most of them were only at the Freedom Realm.

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial stopped chatting and soon, the Grand Primordium Hall quietened down.

After a long while…

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial opened his eyes and said, “Everyone, we have gathered for the Primordial Fiendcelestial this time. Although there is a prophecy that the Primordial Fiendcelestial has yet to be born, this matter has already endangered us Chaotic Fiendcelestials. It’s not impossible if a Great Dao Divine Spirit, Eternal Divine Spirit, Chaotic Lifeform, and the others use the Primordial Fiendcelestial to eliminate us.”

The atmosphere in the hall fell silent.

Han Jue was secretly curious. Who spread the prophecy?

He had to calculate when he returned.

The Ancient Fiendcelestials spoke again and began to discuss where the Primordial Fiendcelestial might be born and who could harm them.

Han Jue would answer when it involved the Heavenly Dao. Everything was fine as long as it didn’t involve sovereignty.

This conversation was very long and would probably last for a long time.

Inside the Daoist temple.

Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned. He entered seclusion for another ten thousand years, but his clone had yet to return.

Without his clone returning, Han Jue felt uneasy and found it difficult to calm down and cultivate in peace.

After all, a group of mighty figures was plotting to kill him behind his back. It would be very difficult for them to calm down if it were anyone else.

Han Jue opened the emails to relax.
