Chapter 975 Consciousnessless Great Dao World

The armored man’s expression became sinister after recondensing his body. With a roar, he began to swing his saber crazily. Saber Qi swept out, carrying strange and profound runes. The runes expanded and flew in all directions.

Dao Sovereign and the other three were pushed into the distance. The ground shattered.

Zhao Xuanyuan looked at the armored man in horror and cursed in a low voice. “This fellow is so terrifying! He probably didn’t think much of us previously!”

No one replied. Lao Dan’s expression was also ugly. Although Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi were severely injured, the pain was nothing to them. They were only worried that Han Jue could not block it.

The world kept collapsing. No matter how the armored man attacked, he could not break through the Ultimate Mortal Robe’s defense.

Han Jue raised his right hand and raised thousands of hand shadows. It was dazzling. He pushed forward gently.

Great Change Sealing Palm!

Obsessed with attacking and did not dodge, the armored man was directly struck by the palm and could not move instantly.

He hung in the air, staring at Han Jue.

The huge commotion in the world stopped.

Dao Sovereign and the other three were stunned.

They were all worried for Han Jue when they felt the armored man’s aura just now. They didn’t expect that the armored man wouldn’t be able to move after Han Jue’s casual move.

Han Jue looked at them and asked, “Are you leaving or staying here?”

Zhao Xuanyuan came back to his senses and hurriedly said, “Staying here. We’ve been here for more than 200,000 years and nothing happened. Today was just an accident. This fellow is too strong. Our Dharma treasures and Mystical Powers can’t do anything to him, but he can still summon Resentful Devils. We had no choice but to ask you for help.”

Han Jue waved his sleeve and took the armored man and the scale saber away. Then, he stepped back into the black vortex.

The vortex shrank and everything returned to normal.

Lao Dan sighed. “Your master is indeed the strongest in the Chaos. That fellow’s aura has already surpassed the Great Dao Sage, but in front of him…”

Zhao Xuanyuan said proudly, “Of course!” Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi began to heal their injuries.

Han Jue asked in his mind after returning to the third Dao Field, “Where was that place just now?”

[1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

So expensive! The value of a Dao Creator!

Continue!

[Consciousnessless Great Dao World: A world created by the Chaotic Deity, Chaotic Consciousness. It is suppressed by the Chaos and has no life. It is vast and endless.]

Suppressed by the Chaos…

Han Jue instantly thought of many things.

No wonder the appearance rate of the Chaotic Consciousness was so high. Logically speaking, the Dao Creator had already jumped out of the Chaos and should not appear again, such as the other two Dao Creators whose names were unknown.

It turned out that the Chaotic Consciousness world was suppressed by the Ninth Chaos. In that case, the Chaotic Consciousness might have been subdued by the Ninth Chaos and become a Chaotic Deity to watch over the Chaos’ safety.

It was not impossible!

The Chaotic Consciousness had supported the rise of Azure Heaven Mystic in the Chaos. It was probably part of the plan.

Han Jue thought about how uncomfortable it would be if his Primordial World was suppressed by the Chaos.

It seemed that unless it was absolutely necessary, he could not expose the Primordial World’s existence.

The Ninth Chaos seemed to have no desires, but that was only on the surface.

As for Dao Sovereign and the other three, Han Jue couldn’t be bothered. These guys liked to wander around and couldn’t stay idle. This was also good. They could unlock more new maps for him.

Han Jue took out the scale saber. As for the armored man, he had already erased him. The armored man’s true form was this saber.

This treasure was not simple. At the very least, it was a Chaotic Supreme Treasure. It was enough to make any Great Dao existence envious.

He began to use Absolute Purification.

Han Ling asked curiously after opening her eyes and seeing the saber, “Father, what is this?”

“A Dharma treasure.”

“I know that. What I want to know is…”

“You want it?”

Han Ling nodded in embarrassment.

In the simulation trial, she discovered that many opponents had powerful Dharma treasures. Sometimes, Dharma treasures were stronger than Mystical Powers.

Han Jue said, “This treasure is ferocious. I have to eliminate its hostility first. Wait for me to finish.”

“Mm.”

Han Ling responded, but her gaze was fixed on the scale saber.

Han Jue recalled the Ultimate Dao Treasure he had snatched from the Carefree Immortal.

He immediately took out this treasure. The half-moon red jade floated in his palm, attracting Han Ling’s gaze.

“Choose one of the two. You can only choose one,” Han Jue said casually, not knowing which Dharma treasure was stronger.

Han Ling pointed at the half-moon red jade. “I want this one. It’s stronger. The power it contains is very similar to my Great Creation.”

Han Jue raised his eyebrows. This girl was only a Freedom Sage and could already spy on the Ultimate Dao Treasure?

The half-moon red jade had long been purified and was not dangerous. However, Han Ling had to become stronger if she wanted to subdue this treasure.

Han Jue threw the half-moon red jade to her.

The Ultimate Dao Treasure was indeed impressive, but Han Jue had more than one. This treasure was not an offensive or defensive treasure. It was more inclined towards creation and karma.

Han Ling took the treasure and immediately beamed. She began to study it.

Several hundred years later.

The scaled saber was successfully purified. The saber spirit in the saber no longer surged. It fell into a deep sleep and waited for its master to wake it up.

This treasure was not simple. It contained Great Dao Supreme power and extremely strong killing intent. It could be left to disciples or descendants in the future.

Han Jue thought of someone.

Han Yu!

This fellow was more obedient than Han Huang and Han Tuo. He followed the instructions obediently.

It was time to support him.

As Han Jue was thinking, a line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.

(The Chaotic Consciousness sent you a dream. Do you accept?]

Han Jue’s heart trembled.

Dao Creator!

“Is it dangerous for me to accept this dream?”

(1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief and silently chose to accept it.

The dream was a blank domain. Countless remains floated around it. It was ghastly and terrifying

Han Jue looked around but did not find the Chaotic Consciousness. At this moment, a huge head suddenly turned around. Its eight eyes stared at him. Han Jue frowned and asked, “Who are you? Why are you visiting me in my dreams?”

The Chaotic Consciousness smiled. “I am a Chaotic Deity.”

Chaotic Deity!

Han Jue was moved and pretended to be shocked.

He muttered to himself, “Chaotic Deity… Could it be that the existence who created the Supreme Rules really exists…”

The Chaotic Consciousness said, “I’m not the one who created the Chaos and the Supreme Rules, but the Ninth Chaos you saw before. I’m only responsible for protecting the Chaotic Order. The matter of the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit made the Ninth Chaos very dissatisfied with me.”

Han Jue remained silent.

He didn’t know what the Chaotic Consciousness wanted to tell him.

After all, the Chaotic Consciousness still had a one-star favorability towards him.

“Han Jue, there’s no hope for you to reach our level. The Great Dao Supreme Realm is your limit. You can’t go beyond the Great Dao Supreme Realm even if you’re still becoming stronger,” the Chaotic Consciousness said faintly.

“You went to the Consciousnessless Great Dao World when you went to save your disciples. This world was created by an existence that surpassed the Great Dao Supreme Realm. It’s equivalent to a second Chaos. However, he was suppressed by the Ninth Chaos as soon as he created this world. The Consciousnessless Great Dao World was suppressed by the Chaos. All the Spirit Qi in the world was sucked away by the Chaos and the Consciousnessless Great Dao World became a place of nothingness.”
