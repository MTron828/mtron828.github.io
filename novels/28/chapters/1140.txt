Chapter 1143 Undiscovered Place

Ever since the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended, although Han Huang had obtained a huge opportunity, he discovered that it was very difficult for his cultivation level to increase, as if he had already reached his limit.

He was a Primordial Fiendcelestial. How could he have a limit?

Could it be that the potential of those Dao Creators was stronger than his?

Impossible!

!!

Han Huang fell into deep thought. Could it be that he had killed too many people, causing the Primordial Chaos to be unable to transform?

However, he had observed the other Great Dao Worlds. Other than the Great Dao World of the Dao Creator, the other Great Dao Worlds could not successfully condense the Supreme Rules. In other words, the existences at the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm were temporarily on the same starting line.

From the embryonic Great Dao World to the complete Great Dao World, this process was extremely difficult!

The Dao Creators did not guide the Great Dao Supremes. Even if their own people asked, they would only answer. The path to

becoming a Dao Creator varied from person to person. How stable the Great Dao World was depended on one’s own creation.

Just as Han Huang was feeling frustrated, footsteps came from the darkness beside him. A figure slowly walked over.

Han Huang was not surprised. He didn’t even turn around.

This figure was completely black and had a human figure. A pair of red eyes with black pupils appeared on his face, looking sinister.

“It takes time to condense your Great Dao World. How long did it take the Chaos to evolve? How long has your Primordial Chaos been evolving?”

The red-eyed black shadow smiled with a mocking tone.

Han Huang snorted. “I know. But even if it takes time, you can at least sense the

progress, right?”

The red-eyed black shadow said, “There are a

total of five Dao Creators now. Your father is one of them. Why don’t you ask him for guidance?”

Han Huang sighed. “How can I have the face to look for him again?”

He was not Chu Xiaoqi. He was born to be

strong. With his unparalleled talent, if he could not rely on his father, he would try his best not to.

The red-eyed black shadow snorted. “How pretentious. Your body was given by your parents and your father saved you many

times. Do you really think you relied on yourself? You started from the beginning and

completely relied on your father. You just don’t dare to accept reality. Perhaps that’s the

reason why you can’t succeed.”

Han Huang’s expression instantly turned

ugly, but he was not angry.

The red-eyed black shadow continued to mock him. “Now there are three Primordial Fiendcelestials: you, Primordial Origin, and Huang Zuntian. Your potential is no longer unique. Put down your arrogance.

“So what if I let go of my arrogance? If Father could guide the path of a Dao Creator, the Hidden Sect would have long produced a second Dao Creator. It’s the same for the

other Dao Creators.”

“Perhaps they don’t want anyone to reach the

Dao Creator Realm, even if they’re on their side. Because the Dao Creator Realm is supreme, there are very few of them.”

“I

…

Han Huang was silent. The red-eyed black

shadow did not say anything else and retreated into the darkness.

The hall was silent.

Han Huang slowly stood up. His gaze

darkened as he muttered, “Perhaps I should really look for Father.”

He disappeared into the hall.

Several days later, Han Jue received Han

Huang.

Han Huang asked about the method to attain

the Dao. Han Jue didn’t say anything else and directly preached the Dao, telling him his creation experience. Han Jue was naturally not stingy with his son.

However, the Dao Creator’s method to attain the Dao was extremely difficult. It was useless to know how to build the Great Dao World.

After all, every Great Dao World was different.

If one wanted to attain the Dao, one had to rely on potential or epiphany.

Han Jue relied on his potential to become a

Dao Creator with the potential of the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial. It was not difficult. However, he couldn’t tell Han Huang this

directly.

After a long time, when Han Jue finished speaking, Han Huang woke up. He hurriedly bowed to express his gratitude.

The father and son did not exchange pleasantries. Han Huang left.

Han Jue couldn’t help but shake his head

upon seeing Han Huang’s excited expression. Will he hate me if he still fails?

Han Jue had already seen Han Huang develop

mental demons. This kid even created mental demons into clones and often talked to them.

This time, Han Huang came because the mental demon clone persuaded him. It was not impossible for father and son to

fight. Han Jue looked at the future. Han Huang’s

future continued until he reached the Dao Creator Realm. Although he had always treated him as a target, he had never crossed the line with him.

The future was endless.

Han Jue retracted his gaze and continued

cultivating.

He suddenly felt that time passed very slowly ever since the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended. Perhaps his cultivation level had increased too slowly, causing his

cultivation passion to decrease greatly.

No!

He could not be numbed!

Those Dao Creators were so relaxed, causing them to be unable to improve. However, he couldn’t cultivate blindly. The nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ninth Chaos buried his head in cultivation

and gave Han Jue a chance to rise. The Ninth Chaos probably couldn’t understand even until his death. He had only taken a nap. Why did he give Han Jue a chance? How did Han Jue create a Dao Field

that even a Dao Creator couldn’t enter in so little time?

Han Jue needed to cultivate, but he couldn’t cultivate too much.

He looked at the corner where a ball of gray Qi

floated. It was the Ninth Chaos’ will. It was being enslaved by the Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison. The disciples entering and leaving did not sense anything special about

the gray Qi.

Han Liang was once curious about it, but he

was chased away by Han Jue and never dared to approach it again.

Han Liang was not afraid of anything but Han Jue. Perhaps it was his bloodline suppression. The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial’s bloodline was stronger than his bloodline, after all.

…

Under the old tree, Han Liang opened his eyes

It

and looked angrily at a man beside him. was Han Jue’s grand-disciple, Murong Qi. “Didn’t you agree to have the same cultivation level as me?” Han Liang said angrily as he clenched his fists.

Murong

our

Qi smiled. “Yes, I did suppress my cultivation, but the difference between bodies can’t be suppressed.”

Han Liang turned his head away, looking like

he would not listen.

Murong Qi stood up and prepared to leave.

“Ah! Why are you leaving! I’ve never played it before!” “Forget it. You can’t afford it. “No, Brother Murong, I was wrong!” Han

Liang hugged Murong Qi’s right leg and said pitifully.

Murong Qi had no choice but to sit back down. Han Liang was now the favored son of the

entire Dao Field. Because of his temperament and body, everyone liked him. “Brother Murong, can you tell me about the outside world? Don’t you often wander

outside?” Han Liang asked curiously and stopped the simulation trial.

He did not like to be tortured, either. Murong Qi did not hide anything. He talked about his experiences outside. Sometimes, he was excited, sometimes he sighed. Han Liang

widened his eyes and clenched his fists, exclaiming.

“Han Liang, do you want to go out too?”

Murong Qi rubbed Han Liang’s head and asked with a smile.

Han Liang nodded. “Of course. I’m already

tired of staying in the Dao Field, but Grandpa doesn’t let me out.”

Murong Qi smiled. “Indeed, we shouldn’t go out. Once we go out, it’s very difficult to return. It’s not only that you don’t want to return, but your grandfather won’t let you cultivate beside him anymore. The greatest opportunity in the world is your grandfather. You have to think about it.”

Han Liang tilted his head and fell into deep

thought.

Murong Qi continued, “You have to find your cultivation goal. You can’t just become stronger in general. Everyone has their own

life. You have to find the true meaning of your

life.”

Han Liang said in a low voice, “I want to go to

a place that has never been discovered.”
