Chapter 258 Pan Xin, Great Traversal Divine Shadow

Someone was looking for trouble in the Sword Dao River again?

Han Jue frowned. He suddenly felt that this was a tough job. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He immediately jumped into the Sword Dao River and arrived before Liu Bei.

Liu Bei heaved a sigh of relief when he saw him.

He immediately pointed in a direction.

Han Jue turned around and saw a wretched back view.

The man had his back to them. His right shoulder shook, and his right hand seemed to be groping in front of him.

He was as thin as a match.

Han Jue immediately thought of an image. He immediately asked, “What are you doing?”

The person did not turn around or answer.

Han Jue asked in a low voice, “If you don’t speak, I can only ask the Heavenly Emperor about this!”

Because this was not the Reroll World, Han Jue couldn’t detect the other party’s cultivation.

To be safe, he had to use his strongest trump card.

However, the other party was still indifferent.

So arrogant?

Han Jue was annoyed and prepared to use the power of the Sword Dao River to expel the other party. Boom!

The entire Sword Dao River began to fluctuate violently. All the figures advancing vanished.

At this moment, the thin figure suddenly stopped moving.

He turned his head and said, “Junior, why so rash? I just want to hide here for a while.”

Han Jue asked, “In other words, you might bring us more trouble?”

“You’re really… Well, you can say that.”

“Then, can I ask you to leave, Senior?”

“A Grand Unity Mystic Immortal dares to be so reckless?

“You’re too much!

“Do you know who I am?”

“What? Are you the Heavenly Father?”

“Who is the Heavenly Father?” “The Heavenly Emperor’s father.”

“Oh, I’m even stronger than that!”

Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat.

Could it be true?

Could this fellow really be a mighty figure?

couldn’t find anything. It was as if this person didn’t exist.

This time, Han Jue was even more nervous. If there’s no other way, I might as well run away with Liu Bei!

Although it was his good brother’s inheritance, there was no need to guard it. Thinking of this, Han Jue wanted to retreat.

“Alright, you’re impressive. I’ll let you have it!”

Han Jue snorted and looked at Liu Bei. “Let’s

go!”

Liu Bei was stunned. We’re leaving just like that?

Good.

He didn’t have to worry all the time now.

“Wait!”

The thin figure hurriedly stopped Han Jue and said angrily, “Why are you so spineless?” Han Jue said, “You’re so powerful. Can I defeat you?”

“Although you can’t win, how do you know if you don’t try?”

“Forget it, it’s too dangerous.”

“You brat…”

The thin figure was speechless. This was the first time he had encountered such an oddity. There were many timid people, but they were not as confident as Han Jue. Moreover, he didn’t reveal any aura at all.

This fellow…

Interesting!

[Pan Xin has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 1 star.] Han Jue saw the line of words in front of him and hurriedly checked Pan Xin’s information through interpersonal relationships. [Pan Xin: Cultivation unknown. One of the first living beings after the creation of the universe. He has experienced the Immeasurable Calamity. As he is afraid of being discovered by the ancient Master of Calamity, he especially infiltrated the Sword Dao River. Due to your nature, he has developed an interest in you. Current favorability: 1 star.) So impressive?

One of the first living beings after the creation of the universe!

Even the Heavenly Emperor didn’t have such an identity!

The key was that this fellow’s surname was Pan!

Han Jue couldn’t help but think of Pangu. Could he be a descendant of Pangu himself?

For a moment, Han Jue’s imagination ran wild, and he became even more nervous.

The unknown cultivation level meant that the other party had surpassed the Immortal Emperor Realm. What should he do when facing such an existence? “Senior, I’ll give you this river. I won’t reveal your existence! “That’s all. Goodbye!” Han Jue hurriedly said. Then, he raised his hand and pressed Liu Bei’s shoulder, preparing to escape with him.

“Wait! I don’t want your Sword Dao River. I don’t want to suffer great karma!” Pan Xin hurriedly shouted. A mysterious force directly sealed the Sword Dao River, preventing Han Jue from jumping out.

Crap.

Am I going to die today?

Han Jue’s heart sank.

“Kid, don’t be afraid. I’m a senior. How can I make things difficult for a junior? This river is still yours. I’m only staying here for a period of time. I won’t let you suffer. I can teach you a Mystical Power. How about that?”

Pan Xin snorted. He felt that the juniors of the Immortal World were getting worse and worse.

Han Jue could only sigh. “Alright.”

Pan Xin flashed in front of him.

He raised his right hand and stretched out three fingers. “I have three Mystical Powers that you can choose from. “First, the Mystical Power of Domination that can kill enemies in an instant!

“Second, the Mystical Power of Karma. You will endure no karma when killing enemies. You will survive the Immeasurable Calamity!

“Third, the Mystical Power of Movement. In battle, you can easily avoid the attacks of powerful enemies and also travel through the myriad worlds!”

Han Jue said without hesitation, “I choose the third one!”

Stunned, Pan Xin said, “The first Mystical Power is the strongest. You don’t want to learn it? The second Mystical Power is even more useful.”

Han Jue shook his head and said, “No need. I’ll choose the third one so that I can escape next time.”

This kid…

Pan Xin was silent.

(Pan Xin’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 2 stars]

Looking at the line of words in front of him, Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

Could it be that they were the same kind of people?

It was very likely! If this fellow was not cowardly, he wouldn’t be hiding here and bickering with a junior like him.

Pan Xin raised his hand and pointed at his forehead.

Before Han Jue could react, his consciousness felt an impact, and a large amount of memories surged into his mind.

Mystical Power, Great Traversal Divine Shadow!

After some time, Han Jue’s consciousness finally woke up.

Liu Bei was sitting beside him. Pan Xin had returned to his original spot. Han Jue didn’t know what he was doing, but his back was still wretched.

Han Jue sorted out the memories of the Great Traversal Divine Shadow.

He was pleasantly surprised.

He just happened to lack such a Mystical Power!

In battle, it could allow one’s speed and reaction to be elevated. It could split into divine shadows and confuse the opponent. It could also directly travel through myriad worlds. It was extremely powerful. Han Jue instructed Liu Bei before returning to the Connate Cave Abode.

He had top-notch movement technique potential, so he could definitely grasp the Great Traversal Divine Shadow. But he didn’t want to be too involved with Pan Xin.

What if he performed too well and the latter wanted to take him in as a disciple?

Pan Xin was powerful, but he had an even greater enemy!

That so-called ancient Master of Calamity sounded ridiculously strong. He was definitely stronger than the Heavenly Emperor!

So, he did not want to take the risk.

Han Jue sat on the bed and immediately started to comprehend the Great Traversal Divine Shadow.

Several days later.

Han Jue successfully grasped it.

He immediately used this Mystical Power, and two figures flew out from his body. They were identical to him and emitted purple light.

Han Jue sensed that their aura was identical to his.

Could it be that the Great Traversal Divine Shadow could help him fight? Han Jue retracted the two divine shadows and started the simulation trial.

He would directly challenge the Heavenly Emperor!

Two breaths later, Han Jue opened his eyes.

Damn it.

The opponent was too strong. The reason why he had survived for a second was that the Heavenly Emperor had first destroyed the divine shadows before killing him.

He couldn’t escape even if he tried.

Han Jue had no choice but to switch his opponent to Jiang Yi. He immediately felt better.

He relied on the Great Traversal Divine Shadow to play with him. Even if Jiang Yi tried his best, he couldn’t touch the corner of his main body’s clothes.
