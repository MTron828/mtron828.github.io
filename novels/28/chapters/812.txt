Chapter 813 Follow Forever

A village with dozens of families was located in a forest. Men and women farmed and weaved. Chickens and dogs were everywhere, and smoke curled up from the chimneys. The village was isolated from the world.

In the forest, behind a huge rock, a two or three-year-old child was meditating and cultivating

His facial features were exquisite and his face was flushed. He had the grace of a girl.

He was Jiang Jueshi.

He had concealed himself deeply and pretended to drink Meng Po’s soup. His memories were still there, so he had started cultivating when he was born. However, he had hidden it very well and no one had discovered him.

At this moment, he suddenly heard footsteps.

Jiang Jueshi immediately opened his eyes and collapsed against the stone. His eyes instantly turned red, as if he had cried.

A figure arrived in front of him.

It was an old Daoist, formed by Han Jue’s clone. His back was stooped, but a hint of Han Jue’s main body could still be seen between his brows.

Han Jue pretended to be surprised and muttered, “There’s actually such talent in the world!”

He picked Jiang Jueshi up and walked towards the village.

Jiang Jueshi drooled and scratched with his small hands. He was pure and cute.

He felt very helpless.

He encountered a cultivator who wanted to take him in as a disciple again. He had experienced so many reincarnations. Such a situation was not rare, so he did not panic and would slowly deal with it in the future.

Han Jue found Jiang Jueshi’s parents and expressed that he was a cultivator and was willing to take Jiang Jueshi in as his disciple. He taught him in the village. His parents were very excited and knelt down to thank him.

This matter caused a commotion in the village. The villagers came to watch the commotion.

As time passed, Han Jue also integrated into it and taught Jiang Jueshi cultivation. He only taught him ordinary cultivation techniques. However, in order to deal with it, Jiang Jueshi also cultivated according to the cultivation technique he taught.

Twenty years later, Jiang Jueshi, who had grown up, bid farewell and prepared to wander the world. In the end, Han Jue insisted on following him, making him helpless.

The master and disciple began to walk around the world.

Three thousand years later.

Han Jue’s hair was already white. He stayed in a simple Daoist temple by the river with Jiang Jueshi.

Compared to three thousand years ago, Han Jue looked older. His aura was like silk and he couldn’t even open his eyes.

Jiang Jueshi sat beside Han Jue and opened his eyes. He said softly, “Master, my lifespan is up.”

Han Jue didn’t move. Jiang Jueshi had to repeat himself.

“Ah? Lifespan… Your potential is so high. You’ve long become an immortal… Why do you still have a lifespan?” Han Jue asked while trembling. After saying that, he couldn’t help but cough.

Jiang Jueshi said, “I don’t understand it, either. Perhaps it’s fate. The heavens gave me talent, but they also deprived me of my lifespan.”

Han Jue stopped talking.

Jiang Jueshi glanced at him and sighed.

Even a stone would be moved after three thousand years of companionship.

In this life, he owed his master the most.

He did not tell his master that he had already reached the Deity Realm. He was prepared to die already.

But he suddenly felt a little reluctant. He didn’t know what his master would do after he died.

His master was only at the Soul Formation Realm. His lifespan was probably coming to an end.

Jiang Jueshi only felt a little guilty, but he had experienced a hundred thousand reincarnations and his Dao heart was as firm as a rock.

“See you in the next life. No, there’s no next life.”

Jiang Jueshi thought to himself. He had severed ties with countless relatives and wives. Once he reincarnated, it would be very difficult to meet them again.

After countless reincarnations, he might have a chance to meet him, but he did not intend to befriend him.

The karma that was severed should not be reattached.

Several decades later.

Jiang Jueshi quietly reincarnated and came to another mortal world.

In this life, he was born into a rich family.

At the age of three, snow fell from the sky. The world was vast and snow covered the city.

Jiang Jueshi was quietly cultivating in the courtyard when he suddenly heard the servants passing by talking about what was happening outside. “Is that old beggar dead or alive?”

“I’m not sure, but lying at the entrance of our residence is not a good idea.”

“Master has already sent someone to find a doctor.”

Since Jiang Jueshi had nothing to do, he went to watch the commotion.

A group of servants gathered in front of the mansion’s entrance. Many commoners were also watching the commotion on the streets outside, pointing.

Seeing Jiang Jueshi come out, a servant girl hurriedly held his hand. However, she couldn’t help but want to watch the commotion, so she carried him to the door.

Jiang Jueshi looked at the old beggar lying on the ground and suddenly frowned.

“Master?”

Jiang Jueshi had a strange expression. Wasn’t this his master in his previous life?

The weak old beggar slowly opened his eyes and met his gaze.

The old beggar suddenly widened his eyes and flipped over, startling the crowd.

The old beggar stared at Jiang Jueshi and muttered, “Such potential… There’s actually a second person in the world? Could it be the reincarnation of my disciple?”

The young Jiang Jueshi’s mouth twitched.

It was really his master!

How did this old man find this place?

He could cross worlds in just a few decades?

Jiang Jueshi suddenly smelled a conspiracy and instinctively became vigilant. This was the first time he had encountered such a thing in the previous hundred thousand reincarnations.

Ten thousand years passed. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at the Heavenly Dao first.

Jiang Jueshi was still entangled with his clone. After meeting in his second life, Jiang Jueshi was originally wary. Later, he discovered that his master had met him by chance, so the master and disciple began to wander the world again.

Although he said that he was wandering the world, he was actually finding a place to hide and cultivate. He was isolated from the world and did not even have friends, let alone enemies.

Han Jue admired Jiang Jueshi even more.

This fellow was not like a human. He was too determined, like a cultivation machine.

In order to make Jiang Jueshi no longer suspect his clone, Han Jue made the clone swear. “Even if I reincarnate for ten thousand lifetimes, I will definitely find my disciple and help him break the shackles of fate and obtain immortality.”

Jiang Jueshi was extremely afraid when he heard this.

Was this old man really going to pester him?

However, the old man was only in the Soul Formation Realm and should not live for long.

Jiang Jueshi passed away again after he reached the Deity Realm.

Before he died, his master held his hand and cried. “The Heavenly Dao is unfair, the Heavenly Dao is unfair. Why did my disciple have to die after becoming an immortal…”

Jiang Jueshi felt a little uncomfortable, but he still closed his eyes in the end.

Several decades later.

Jiang Jueshi was born into the royal family and was the prince.

He was secretly happy. This time, that old man could not reach him, right?

However, the court welcomed an immortal when he was five years old. It was his master.

Unlike in his previous life, Han Jue was much younger in this life, as if he was in his forties. When Jiang Jueshi learned that this fellow had actually attained the Grand Unity Dao Fruit, his lifespan increased greatly and his essence, energy, and spirit also increased greatly.

This dogshit luck…

Just like that, Jiang Jueshi was pestered by Han Jue again.

In the demonic path’s abyss, turbid mist filled the air.

Han Tuo and Yi Tian were fighting and were on par.

The Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan suddenly appeared and said, “I have a mission for you.”

Han Tuo and Yi Tian immediately stopped.

They came in front of the Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan with anticipation.

They had been here for too long and wanted to go out!

They were not the masters of bitter cultivation, to begin with. They needed to fight and constantly break through in battle, constantly surpassing their limits!
