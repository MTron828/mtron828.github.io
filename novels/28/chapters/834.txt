Chapter 837 Legend of the Immeasurable Calamity, Three Million Years Old

With that said, the Heavenly Dao Palace fell silent.

Dao Sovereign and the other two were also stunned.

The Sages here were not all from the Hidden Sect, but Han Jue said that they were?

Fang Liang asked carefully, “Grandmaster, you mean…”

Han Jue said expressionlessly, “You can trust each other. There’s no need to pretend anymore.”

Whoosh,

The Sages were in an uproar!

Pan Xin stared at Heavenly Venerate Wufa and cursed, “I knew there was something wrong with you. Your acting is too superficial!”

Heavenly Venerate Wufa rolled his eyes and said, “What do you know? If I’m not obvious, even Xuan won’t get it!”

The other Sages also chatted.

Sect Master Tian Jue looked at Qiu Xilai and sighed. “Fellow Daoist Qiu, you’re also very obvious.”

Qiu Xilai smiled and said, “Amitabha.”

......

Han Yu looked at the excited Sages and swallowed.

So many Sages belonged to the Hidden Sect?

After the Sages chatted for a while and calmed down, Han Jue said, “Who do you think we need to rope in and eliminate among the Heavenly Dao Sages to stabilize the Heavenly Dao?”

The Heavenly Dao Sages looked at each other.

They understood what he meant. Heavenly Venerate Wufa smiled and said, “Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, I think. It’s best to rope him in. After all, he controls the Heavenly Dao.”

Xu Dudao said, “Yang Che must be eliminated. This fellow is poaching Sages everywhere. What a despicable person!”

The other Sages spoke.

Han Jue raised his hand and pulled Yang Che into the Heavenly Dao Palace.

Yang Che was stunned as he looked at the surrounding Sages.

Han Jue waved his palm and used the Great Change Sealing Palm to freeze him.

Yang Che widened his eyes and could not move.

Han Jue left after saying, “In the future, you can discuss the matters of the Heavenly Dao. I will also keep an eye on the other Sages.”

Yang Che also disappeared.

The Sages looked at each other.

Jiang Yi asked curiously, “Will that Sage die?”

Zhao Xuanyuan shook his head. “How can a Heavenly Dao Sage die so easily?”

Qiu Xilai stood up and scanned the Sages. “Since everyone’s already united, think of a way to rope in the other Sages. First, control the power of the various important places near the Heavenly Dao.”

Heavenly Venerate Wufa glanced at him and did not say anything. The other Sages nodded.

Although it was a discussion, there should be a leader among them to achieve great things.

After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue directly threw Yang Che into the Primordial Heavenly Prison.

He looked outside the 33rd Heaven, searching for the other Sages.

The favorability of the other Sages did not decrease for the time being, nor did they particularly cross the line.

He could observe again.

Ten thousand years later, Han Jue placed Yang Che back outside the 33rd Heaven.

Yang Che returned to his Dao Field. Just as he sat down, Tai Sutian and Jin Shen came.

Tai Sutian wore white and had a beautiful and cold expression. She frowned and asked, “Yang Che, where have you been all these years?”

Yang Che opened his eyes and smiled. “I went out for a walk. What do you want?”

Jin Shen asked, “How many Sages have you roped in?”

Yang Che said in a low voice, “I thought about it and decided to forget it.”

Forget it? The two Sages were stunned as they stared at him.

Yang Che sighed. “I’ve personally been to the Three Pure Sacred World before. I actually didn’t tell you clearly. Actually, the Three Pure Sacred World doesn’t think highly of me and even neglected me. Some time ago, I comprehended the Heavenly Dao and discovered that it might not lose. In that case, why should we suffer?”

Jin Shen pondered and asked, “Why can you comprehend the Heavenly Dao?”

Yang Che shook his head and did not say anything

He looked at Tai Sutian and said, “You would rather go to the Three Pure Sacred World than worship Nüwa. I think you have nowhere to go. Why don’t we join forces to serve the Heavenly Dao? This is our home, after all. If you go elsewhere, you will be living under someone else’s roof.”

Tai Sutian frowned even more.

Yang Che continued to persuade.

Jin Shen felt that something was wrong.

He suddenly thought of something and his expression became strange.

Could this fellow have submitted to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?!

In the Universal Hall.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and Lao Dan meditated side by side. Their bodies were filled with wisps of green smoke that scattered and appeared occasionally.

Lao Dan opened his eyes and asked, “What do you think?”

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du did not even open his eyes and asked back, “What are you referring to, Teacher?”

“Of course, it’s the Heavenly Dao.”

“I’m not thinking about it.”

“Hehe, do you really want to guard the Heavenly Dao until you die?” “In the past, I abandoned the Human Race for the sake of cultivation. For the sake of freedom, I abandoned the Heavenly Dao. I’m not willing to abandon it anymore. I want to risk it.”

“Your cultivation level can’t even compare to a Divine Authority General. How can you fight?” “At least Fellow Daoist Han is here.”

Lao Dan was silent.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du opened his eyes and said, “How is the Three Pure Sacred World prepared to welcome the Divine Authority Generals? Are they going to sever the karma of the Heavenly Dao and give up everything?”

Lao Dan smiled teasingly. “The reason the Heavenly Dao is targeted is that it’s related to Pangu. The Three Pure Ones have long jumped out of karma. How can they stay below Pangu?”

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Everyone has their own ambitions. I wish Teacher success.”

“Hehe.”

Lao Dan shook his head and stood up.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked, “Where are you going?”

“Let’s go see those three silly kids. I have to think of a way to save them so as to not waste so much effort if the Heavenly Dao dies.”

Lao Dan waved his hand and disappeared.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sighed.

In the Immortal World.

The Immeasurable Calamity finally welcomed its end.

Qin Ling and Xia Zhizun brought the geniuses of the Divine Palace and slaughtered their way into the Buddhist Sect. However, the Sages attacked and suppressed them with a palm.

The power of a Sage shocked, terrified, and even caused despair to countless living beings near the spiritual mountain.

Fortunately, at the critical moment, the Sage of the Divine Palace, Zhang Guxing, appeared. The Sage negotiated, and when the situation was at a stalemate, the Buddha who was hated by Qin Ling appeared. He made a great wish and was willing to sacrifice himself to repay his blood feud with Qin Ling. He turned all his immeasurable merit into the power of a great wish and revived all the living beings who had died near the spiritual mountain.

At this point, the Immeasurable Calamity that had lasted for hundreds of thousands of years ended. In the last tens of thousands of years, the slaughter was cruel. All living beings had long become tired of killing and looked forward to peace.

In this battle, the Sages attacked openly, making all living beings understand that everyone below the Sages were ants.

Qin Ling and Xia Zhizun obtained a huge amount of Heavenly Dao merit and followed Zhang Guxing to the 33rd Heaven.

They only needed to sit quietly for tens of thousands of years and inherit the Heavenly Dao merit to become Sages. In order to eliminate the negative karma of the world, the Sages began to preach the Dao. The disciples of the various providence sects also began to travel the world and preach the Dao everywhere.

In short, this Immeasurable Calamity had ended successfully.

After all living beings learned of the cruelty of the Immeasurable Calamity, they respected Sages and cherished peace even more.

Year after year passed.

Ten thousand years later.

The Immeasurable Calamity had already become a legend. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Han Jue was still cultivating in seclusion. He had already immersed himself in the impact of the Great Dao.

On this day.

Three lines of words appeared in front of him.
