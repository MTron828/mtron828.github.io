Chapter 225 Hatred of the Demon Emperor, Friend of the War God

Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Dream Demoness was drowned by the Three Pure World Cleansing and her body and soul were destroyed.

Great Sage Heavenly Fox, who had dodged, showed a drastic change in expression. He could sense that the Dream Demoness’ aura was instantly obliterated.

Impossible!

Before Great Sage Heavenly Fox could think further, the billions of sword shadows of the Three Pure World Cleansing turned around and attacked him. They were like a torrent of the Heavenly Dao that swept through the void, unstoppable.

Great Sage Heavenly Fox turned around and fled in fear.

Han Jue raised his left hand and used the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger, shooting at Great Sage Heavenly Fox’s head!

Great Sage Heavenly Fox didn’t die even after having lost his head. He was still fleeing. However, his speed was affected. Three Pure World Cleansing quickly caught up and destroyed his body and soul!

In the simulation trial, the reason he couldn’t kill the two Demon Saints was that they were proficient in escaping.

After being exhausted by Divine Lord Wu De, the two Demon Saints were caught off guard. How could they escape? The entire process took less than two breaths of time.

The two perfected Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm cultivators couldn’t withstand Han Jue’s sword Qi.

He had used two Emperor Realm Mystical Powers!

Not every Grand Unity Golden Immortal was like Jiang Yi!

Divine Lord Wu De was dumbfounded as he looked at Han Jue in shock.

Impossible!

He directly killed two famous Demon Saints!

How strong is this person?

Han Jue cupped his fists and said, “Thank you.”

With that, he turned around and left.

Divine Lord Wu De was still stunned and couldn’t recover from his shock.

Inside the Numinous Palace.

The Heavenly Emperor waved his sleeve and retracted the mirror.

Di Taibai sighed. “This child’s strength is truly terrifying. His breakthrough speed is even faster than the one from the Divine Palace and the Golden Crow Divine Clan!”

The Heavenly Emperor said calmly, “This is why I treat him so well. He’s worth it.”

Di Taibai nodded.

Such talent was indeed worthy of being nurtured by the Heavenly Court at all costs.

“Has the war between the Golden Crow Divine Clan and the Divine Palace ended?” the Heavenly Emperor asked.

Di Taibai replied, “It’s over. The Divine Palace compromised and gave the three star domains to the Golden Crow Divine Clan.”

He couldn’t help but sigh at the mention of this.

The Divine Palace was so powerful, but it actually compromised!

“The Golden Crow Divine Clan cannot be underestimated. I have always felt that they’re ambitious. In the past, they were the Emperor Clan of the Demon Race. After the Magus-Demon Calamity, the Golden Crow Divine Clan and the Magus Race perished together. Now, both races might rise again. The Heavenly Court needs to weigh their relationships.

“An unprecedented Immeasurable Calamity might be coming.”

The Heavenly Emperor frowned slightly as worry appeared in his eyes. Di Taibai asked carefully, “Your Majesty, what do you see?” The Heavenly Emperor said, “I see an era filled with darkness and the Immortal Gods’ demise. It’s very similar to that legend.”

“Which legend?”

“The Dao-Devil War.”

GaspDi Taibai was shocked. He hurriedly asked, “Will the devils cause chaos in the worlds?”

“Not the Devil Race, but an existence even more terrifying than the devils.”

The Heavenly Emperor’s eyes darkened.

Di Taibai wanted to ask more, but the Heavenly Emperor waved his hand, signaling him to leave. He could only bow and leave.

After leaving the Numinous Palace, Di Taibai was still thinking about the Heavenly Emperor’s words. What could make the Heavenly Emperor uneasy and fearful?

(The Demon Emperor has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]

Han Jue looked at the line of words in front of him and fell silent.

He silently checked his interpersonal relationships.

(Demon Emperor: Cultivation unknown. Lord of the Demon Court, Immeasurable Emperor. He has unified the Demon Race for countless years. He is equivalent to the Lord of the Divine Palace, the Heavenly Emperor of the Heavenly Court, and the Heavenly Dao Buddha of the Buddhist Sect. They are collectively known as the four peaks of the Heavenly Dao. He is a peak existence on the path of cultivation. Because you killed his two Demon Saints, he has developed hatred towards you. Once you leave the Heavenly Court, he will definitely kill you. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]

It looked amazing!

Han Jue secretly felt disdain.

So what if you’re the Demon Emperor?

Do you think I’m afraid of you?

Han Jue picked up the Book of Misfortune with a trembling right hand and started cursing the enemy.

He would first curse the other enemies before cursing the Demon Emperor.

He took a deep breath and started checking his emails.

[Your good friend Long Shan was attacked by a Demon Saint. His life is hanging by a thread. Fortunately, your good friend Divine General helped him.]

(Your good friend Zhou Fan has learned a Dao Sect Mystical Power. His providence has increased greatly.] [Your good friend Di Hongye was attacked by the True Dragon Race) x1863

(Your disciple Su Qi has joined the Divine Palace.]

(Your grand-disciple Murong Qi obtained the Heavenly Court War God inheritance.]

[Your enemy Nine-tailed Demon Empress has developed a mental demon because of your curse.)

(Your enemy Heavenly Rage Buddha has been injured by your curse.]

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen accidentally entered the Chaotic Forbidden Zone.)

Han Jue was overjoyed when he saw that the Nine-tailed Demon Empress and the Heavenly Rage Buddha had been successfully cursed by him.

The pressure from the Demon Emperor immediately decreased.

The Book of Misfortune was indeed reliable.

Han Jue noticed that Su Qi had joined the Divine Palace. Interesting.

It seemed that he could ask him to help save Zhang Guxing in the future.

But then again, if the Heavenly Court could see through Murong Qi and Fang Liang, why couldn’t they see through Su Qi?

Could it be that the Heavenly Court also rejected Su Qi, so they didn’t recruit him? Was the jinx so scary?

Perhaps Su Qi had a higher status, and the Heavenly Court did not dare to recruit him.

Han Jue thought silently. After cursing for a few months, he continued cultivating.

Being targeted by the Demon Emperor, Han Jue had to cultivate harder.

He couldn’t rely on the Heavenly Emperor for his entire life. In the end, he had to rely on himself.

Heavenly Court, beside the Heavenly River, in a cloud stone pavilion. Murong Qi and the Divine General sat opposite each other and drank.

The Divine General smiled and said, “How many years has it been? I can finally drink with you again. In the past, I invited you to join the Heavenly Court, but you refused. Now, you’ve come knocking on my door.”

After changing into the Heavenly General’s silver armor, Murong Qi looked even more handsome. He wasn’t inferior to the Divine General at all, but his dominance was inferior to the latter.

Murong Qi chuckled. “If not for Grandmaster joining the Heavenly Court, I wouldn’t have come. I still don’t approve of the Heavenly Court.”

The Divine General asked suspiciously, “You’ve already awakened your previous life’s memories. Why do you still acknowledge him as your grandmaster? Don’t you think it’s beneath you?”

“Why would that be so?”

“He’s so weak.”

“Do you actually know my Grandmaster’s cultivation level?”

“I see.”

“I’ve only awakened the memories of my previous life. I’m no longer the same person.”

Murong Qi swirled his wine cup as his thoughts drifted.

The Divine General narrowed his eyes and asked, “Hurry up and recover your Immortal Emperor cultivation level. I can’t wait to fight you!”

Murong Qi asked, “The Heavenly Court wants to be tied to the Divine Palace?”

He frowned.

He, who was once the War God of the Divine Palace, was determined to overturn it.

“It’s just the current trend. Perhaps the situation will change tomorrow,” the Divine General said nonchalantly.

“I’m only a spear in the hands of the Heavenly Emperor. I don’t care about the big picture. I will kill whoever the Heavenly Emperor wants me to kill.”

Murong Qi smiled mockingly. It was unknown if he was mocking himself or being disdainful of the Divine General.

The Divine General continued, “Jiang Yi of the Golden Crow Divine Clan has just become an Immortal Emperor. Do you remember him? He almost became your disciple.”

Murong Qi replied, “I don’t remember, it’s no longer important.” He changed the topic and said, “I’m going to the Heaven Punishment Divine Region. Can you accompany me?”
