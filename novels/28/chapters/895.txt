Chapter 897 Six Million Years Old, Only One Piece Missing

In the dream.

Jiang Jueshi opened his eyes and saw Han Jue, who was shining with divine light. He immediately bowed.

He had been looking forward to the next lecture ever since the last one.

The Great Dao of Extreme Origin was too exquisite, finally allowing him to see the hope of attaining the Great Dao.

Han Jue said, “Your cultivation has been good recently.”

Jiang Jueshi said humbly, “Thank you for your lecture, Senior.”

Han Jue asked, “What’s your cultivation goal?”

Jiang Jueshi was stunned.

“All living beings have spirits. With spirits, they have hearts. With hearts, they have motives and expectations. Their hearts will have motives in advance before doing anything. You’re still cultivating now. What do you want?” Han Jue asked casually. These words struck Jiang Jueshi’s heart.

He said, “I want to reach the highest realm of cultivation. I want to revive an old friend.”

Han Jue said, “Cultivation is endless. Your realm will constantly increase as long as you keep cultivating. As for reviving your old friends, there’s a chance now. The Chaos will launch a Chaotic Assembly. If you become a Great Dao Divine Spirit, reviving a person is as easy as flipping your palm.”

Jiang Jueshi’s eyes lit up.

He hurriedly asked about the Chaotic Assembly.

Han Jue told the truth. Jiang Jueshi’s blood boiled after learning the details.

This was an unprecedented gathering of geniuses. As expected of the Chaotic Assembly!

Jiang Jueshi would definitely hesitate if it was the previous him. After all, he didn’t have a backing. He would most likely attract calamity if he stood out. However, it was different now. This senior could be his backing!

“Senior, I…”

Jiang Jueshi hesitated. There were some things he had never said and was embarrassed about.

Han Jue asked, “Are you willing to acknowledge me as your master?”

Jiang Jueshi secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Be it in the Heavenly Dao or the Chaos, there was no relationship more stable than master and disciple. It even surpassed that of father and son. Father and son were only karma from birth. Master and disciple formed karma from pursuing the Dao.

Jiang Jueshi immediately knelt and kowtowed. “Greetings, Master.”

Everything happened smoothly. Han Jue received his favorability.

Han Jue said, “Since you’re my disciple, I’ll teach you a Mystical Power. This Mystical Power is enough to let you dominate the Chaos.”

Jiang Jueshi was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly thanked him.

Han Jue began to preach the Dao, naturally teaching the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.

The lecture ended a hundred years later.

Jiang Jueshi opened his eyes and smiled.

Liu Bei seemed to sense something. He opened his eyes and saw his smile. He couldn’t help but ask, “What’s wrong?”

“I’ve acknowledged that senior as my master,” Jiang Jueshi said softly. He was extremely excited.

What a domineering Divine Might Great Heaven Palm!

Destroy everything! Simple and fierce. They could skip all the fancy Mystical Powers if they cultivate it to the extreme. No matter how many Mystical Powers one had, they would destroy them with a palm!

Jiang Jueshi was even more respectful towards Han Jue.

Liu Bei smiled. “Congratulations.”

Jiang Jueshi smiled. “We’re fellow disciples from now on? Senior!”

Liu Bei shook his head. “We’re considered fellow sect members, but not fellow disciples.”

“Why?”

“To be honest, I’m actually this senior’s clone. He’s the main body. In terms of seniority, I’m also a generation older than

you.”

“Clone?”

Jiang Jueshi widened his eyes and looked at him with a completely different gaze.

Liu Bei was secretly pleased. He had endured for a long time and could finally posture.

Jiang Jueshi sighed. “I see. It’s all because of Master’s favor.”

He was still very touched when he thought about it. In order to accept him, his master had first given him a favor and only accepted him after he was willing to acknowledge him as his master. Such magnanimity was admirable.

He couldn’t help but ask, “Who is my

master?”

Liu Bei was silent. At this moment, Han Jue’s voice entered his ears, allowing him to reveal his identity.

“Heavenly Dao, Divine Might Heavenly Sage. Have you heard of him?”

Jiang Jueshi was moved.

Divine Might Heavenly Sage!

This name was like thunder!

Especially to the Heavenly Dao lifeforms, it was even more of a legend!

Jiang Jueshi also admired the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, but the difference between the two was too great. He knew that he couldn’t come into contact with him.

He recalled something else.

One of the initiators of the Chaotic Assembly was the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!

His heart burned.

In other words, he could freely display his talent in the Chaotic Assembly and not be afraid of being plotted against!

Who would dare to hurt him in the endless Chaos with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage protecting him?

Jiang Jueshi was touched. He had felt that his potential was enough to match his master, but his master was the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, so it was different.

This was the strongest person in the Chaos!

At least, that was what most cultivators thought!

How could such an expert lack prodigies as disciples?

Jiang Jueshi took a deep breath and his eyes became firm.

He couldn’t embarrass the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!

Becoming one of the Ten Absolutes of the Chaos was necessary!

He still had to try his best to fight for the Eternal Peak of the Chaos!

Time passed quickly.

Hundreds of thousands of years later. [Detected that you are six million years old and your life has taken a step forward. You have the following choices:)

(1: Exit seclusion immediately and open the Primordial Chaos in the Chaos. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.)

[2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.)

Han Jue opened his eyes. There was no difference in the reward this time. His heart wouldn’t ache no matter the choice he made.

He immediately chose the second option.

He now had eight Primordial Fragments!

In other words, he would be able to perform a Primordial Chaos Great Creation in a million years!

Han Jue was excited. Son! You’re about to be born!

Han Jue suddenly thought that his son might still have a chance to participate in the Chaotic Assembly.

There were still nine million years until the Assembly. His son had eight million years to catch up.

No one had seen a true Primordial Fiendcelestial other than Han Jue in this world. He might not be exposed as long as his son was not arrogant.

Han Jue thought of the future that he had deduced previously. It seemed difficult not to become arrogant.

Forget it, he would see in the future. Anyway, Han Jue had a safe card to play with Jiang Jueshi around.

He took out the Creation Spirit Stone and fused it with a ball of Fiendcelestial Qi before continuing to cultivate.

He prepared to break through in the next million years. A million years wouldn’t be long as long as he entered seclusion for a long time.

Time passed quickly!

Under the blue sky.

On the stone platform.

The five Divine Punishers stood in front of the Ultimate God of Punishment. Han Tuo reported the information about the Ancient Desolate.

After he finished speaking, the Ultimate God of Punishment asked casually, “In other words, there’s an existence that surpasses the Great Dao Sage Realm hidden in the Ancient Desolate, and you don’t know his identity?”

Han Tuo’s expression darkened. “That’s right. If not for us being in the Great Dao Realm, we probably wouldn’t have been able to come out. A Great Dao Sage called Divine Lord Peacock was forcefully suppressed by that ancient existence and said that he wanted his will to sink there forever.”

The Ultimate God of Punishment fell into deep thought.

Yi Tian said, “Exalted God, don’t ask us to go to the Ancient Desolate anymore. That place is even more terrifying than the bottom of the Chaos. There are too many Dao Devils.”

The Ultimate God of Punishment frowned and asked, “Dao Devils?”

Yi Tian nodded. “It feels like the Ancient Desolate has more living beings than the Heavenly Dao. Damn it, I don’t know where they came from!”
