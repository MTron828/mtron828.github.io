Chapter 951 Reaching the Dao Creator Realm

“What do you mean? Why should I kill him?”

Azure Heaven Mystic frowned and shook off his hand.

His fear of the Carefree Immortal deepened.

After living for so long, the Carefree Immortal was the existence he could not see through the most and was also the most dangerous!

Carefree Immortal said, “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is an anomaly and doesn’t belong to the Chaos. He stepped on many Invincible Supremes and severely affected the fate of the Chaos…”

He spoke slowly, just like he had said to Han Huang and the other two.

Azure Heaven Mystic fell silent.

He was not convinced by the Carefree Immortal, but he did not know how to escape.

Since the other party had said so, he definitely had to make a choice and not beat around the bush.

As long as he rejected him, it would definitely be a life-and-death battle!

The move just now was enough to show the difference in strength.

Carefree Immortal stared at him and said, “Other than you, I also want to support other geniuses. This batch of geniuses will not be controlled by everyone’s will. The meaning behind this is great. It means that you will transcend all living beings and see through the true meaning of the world. It won’t be difficult for you to become a god in the future.”

Azure Heaven Mystic took a deep breath and said, “I thank you for your appreciation, but if I accept it, the path I want to take will be missing and will never be repaired, so I still refuse. Come, I know you won’t let me go. I only want to follow my heart even if I die!

“The Heavenly Dao nurtured me, so I have to fight for the Heavenly Dao!”

The smile on Carefree Immortal’s face vanished and his eyes turned cold.

He said coldly, “In that case, don’t blame me for being impolite. I can give you the Divine Authority, and I can also take it back. Not only will I take it back, but I will also snatch your potential!”

Azure Heaven Mystic laughed. “How can you snatch my talent!”

Boom

A terrifying aura erupted from Azure Heaven Mystic’s body. The divine light of the Supreme Rule burst out, causing his long hair to flutter.

Carefree Immortal narrowed his eyes and muttered, “This aura… No… Impossible!”

Blank Domain.

Han Huang, Jiang Jueshi, and Han Qing’er were still floating, but more and more corpses gathered around them.

Han Qing’er said helplessly, “Why isn’t that fellow here yet?”

Unlike Han Huang and Jiang Jueshi who could still continue to become stronger, it was completely torturous for her to stay here. Her cultivation level could not increase.

Jiang Jueshi opened his eyes and said, “I’ve already developed a perception towards the blank domain. He has indeed never appeared. It seems that my creation and Junior Huang’s potential are not so easy to absorb.”

Han Huang opened his eyes and smiled proudly. “Of course. I suspect that since we’ve already recovered, the potential and creation that he absorbed have also returned. He might have already suffered a backlash and is feeling uncomfortable.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Han Qing’er asked, “Then should we ask Father to fetch us?”

Jiang Jueshi said, “Let’s wait a little longer. This is a good opportunity. This person is too dangerous. We can’t let him grow. If he can snatch our potential, he can snatch the potential of others. If our potential accumulates, the consequences will be unimaginable.”

He had obtained his current achievements because of the overlapping potential of reincarnation. He was also afraid that an enemy like him would appear.

Furthermore, the Carefree Immortal did not need reincarnation. It was even more exaggerated than him to forcefully strip away his potential.

Han Huang did not say anything, but his eyes were filled with anger.

In the past hundred thousand years, other than cultivating again, his anger had also been accumulating.

This matter alerted Han Jue. He only relaxed for a short period of time and was more ashamed.

Before leaving the Dao Field, he had promised all sorts of things that he would definitely not cause trouble. He had even arrogantly said that not many existences in the Chaos were his match.

He had indeed defeated countless experts in the Heavenly Court. This was the only time he had failed.

He couldn’t accept it even if it was only once.

The anger of revenge had already occupied Han Huang’s heart, but he did not show it. Jiang Jueshi and Han Qing’er did not sense it.

Jiang Jueshi looked at him and asked, “Junior Huang, how’s your cultivation? Have you recovered your Great Dao?”

Han Huang replied, “I’ve recovered, but it’s not enough.”

Jiang Jueshi frowned. He suddenly felt that something was wrong with him.

“Junior Huang, are you alright? Did something go wrong with your cultivation?” Jiang Jueshi asked with concern.

Han Huang smiled. “It’s fine. Senior, don’t think too much. I’m just considering a Mystical Power. I have to deal with him well if that fellow appears later.”

Jiang Jueshi smiled and nodded. “I also have this plan. We have to stand up wherever we fall!”

At this moment…

“You want to deal with me?”

Carefree Immortal’s voice sounded, his tone cold.

The three of them turned around in shock and saw a figure flying over from the depths of the blank domain like a ghost, leaving behind afterimages.

Carefree Immortal stopped, but the three of them widened their eyes in shock.

A second head actually grew out of Carefree Immortal. This head was actually Azure Heaven Mystic, but Jiang Jueshi and the other two could not recognize it.

A cold and mocking smile hung on the Carefree Immortal’s face. Azure Heaven Mystic’s expression was cold and heartless. The two faces were side by side, making people feel extremely ridiculous.

Jiang Jueshi asked in a low voice, “Whose face is this? Did you absorb his potential?”

Han Qing’er secretly used the Invocation Technique.

Carefree Immortal smiled and said, “The number one prodigy of the Heavenly Dao. This kid is not simple. He almost devoured me. However, with his creation, I have already surpassed the Great Dao Supreme Realm and the previous Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.

“In other words, you can’t deal with me.”

His gaze landed on Han Qing’er and he smiled. “You’re summoning your father, right? It’s just nice. I’ll surpass those existences above the Chaos if I absorb him.”

Han Qing’er trembled.

Han Huang snorted. “Do you know my father’s cultivation level?”

Carefree Immortal smiled and asked, “Do you know what the cultivation level of the Great Dao Supreme is?”

The three of them were stunned.

Seeing this, the Carefree Immortal laughed wantonly, his tone filled with disdain.

“I’m not sure what the cultivation level of the Great Dao Supreme is. Do enlighten me.”

A voice came from the black vortex behind Han Qing’er. Divine light came from the vortex and Han Jue slowly stepped out.

He activated all his Supreme Treasures, causing his aura to reach its peak.

Han Huang and Jiang Jueshi were shocked. They had never felt such a powerful aura.

The smile on Carefree Immortal’s face gradually disappeared. He stared at Han Jue and said, “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, it’s really better to see you than hear about you.”

Han Jue saw Azure Heaven Mystic, but he didn’t show it.

Wow!

You even dare to touch the karma of the Dao Creator!

If you don’t die, who will?

Chaotic Consciousness, you owe me this karma!

Han Jue smiled and asked, “Who’s behind

you?”

Azure Heaven Mystic shrugged. “No one. I just saw a trace of fate.”

Han Jue sighed. “That’s all?”

“What, you’re not satisfied?”

“I’m sighing for you.”

Han Jue smiled and his eyes narrowed. Jiang Jueshi and the other two moved behind him.

Carefree Immortal smiled and said, “I didn’t only absorb the bloodlines of these three people. I also absorbed the bloodlines of more than a hundred geniuses and the power of several Chaotic Fiendcelestials. The current me has already surpassed the Great Dao Supreme Realm and reached the realm of a Dao Creator!
