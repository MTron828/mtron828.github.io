Chapter 327 Divine Palace Changes Owner, Jie School’s Sect Master

After cursing the Divine Palace Master, about half a year later, the Heavenly Emperor contacted him.

Knowing that Dao Sovereign had already joined the Heavenly Court, Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

“Your Majesty, this information is not bad, right? Don’t say that I didn’t contribute to the Heavenly Court or anything!” Han Jue smiled.

As for the greatest contribution, he couldn’t say it out loud!

After all, it involved the secret of the Dark Forbidden Lord.

The Heavenly Emperor smiled. “Indeed. Dao Sovereign has unlimited potential. At the same time, he’s also an example. The Divine Palace has always been famous for protecting its prodigies. If even Dao Sovereign has fled, the morale of the entire sect will definitely fluctuate.”

The Heavenly Emperor began to look forward to the Heavenly Court’s future.

Dao Sovereign’s addition was indeed a great move!

The Heavenly Emperor continued with a smile, “Dao Sovereign wants to see you very much. Are you coming to the Heavenly Court?”

“Forget it, I’m busy cultivating.” “Hmph, I knew it!”

The Heavenly Emperor didn’t say anything else and severed his divine sense.

Han Jue was in a good mood and continued cultivating

This matter was finally settled. He could finally cultivate in peace.

Cultivating without any worries was faster!

In the Great Ultimate Hall, not only had Han Jue broken through to the Rank Six Immortal Emperor Realm, but his cultivation had also been increasing. In addition to the time he had returned, he was already not far from becoming a Rank Seven Immortal Emperor.

After breaking through to this realm, he was not far from the Rank Nine Immortal Emperor Realm.

After reaching the rank nine Immortal Emperor Realm, he was not far from the Deity Realm.

After reaching the Deity Realm, was the Zenith Heaven still far away?

Just thinking about it made Han Jue excited.

A hall shook violently. All the decorations in the hall swayed.

“Damn it! Damn it! Ahhh—”.

The Divine Palace Master roared angrily. His hair was disheveled and his eyes were bloodshot. “Heavenly Emperor! Dark Forbidden Lord! If I don’t kill you, I’d have cultivated for naught!”

The Divine Palace Master was furious.

After roaring for a period of time, he had no choice but to continue circulating his energy to heal his injuries. The Dark Forbidden Lord’s curse power was too strong, causing him to almost have mental demons. In addition, when he learned that Dao Sovereign had joined the Heavenly Court, his anger attacked his heart and injured him even more.

At this moment, a gust of wind blew into the hall and turned into a white-robed man.

The white-robed man stared at the Divine Palace Master and said in a low voice, “Junior Brother, you forced Dao Sovereign away?”

The Divine Palace Master’s expression changed slightly when he saw him. He gritted his teeth and said, “I didn’t force him!”

“He was captured by the Demon Emperor. Why didn’t you save him? It’s impossible that you learned of this later than the Heavenly Court, right?” “I… I just…”

The Divine Palace Master revealed his deal with the Demon Emperor.

The white-robed man said angrily, “Nonsense. How can the three regions compare to the Chaotic Physique? When the calamity ends, no matter how many regions there are, they will all be covered in bones!

“What does the Chaotic Physique represent? It’s at least a Zenith Heaven!

“Although the Divine Palace is strong, how many Zenith Heavens are there?”

The Divine Palace Master was extremely aggrieved.

After a short while, he couldn’t help but say, “There are so many prodigies in the Divine Palace. I’m just asking him to endure for a thousand years. What does it mean for him to betray the Divine Palace? His intentions are punishable!

“How much effort has the Divine Palace poured into Dao Sovereign? For the sake of the Divine Palace, so what if he waits a thousand years?”

Boom

The white-robed man suddenly stomped his feet. A terrifying pressure landed on the Divine Palace Master, causing his expression to change.

The white-robed man said coldly, “Looks like it’s not appropriate to hand the position of Divine Palace Master to you. From today onwards, I’ll be in charge of the Divine Palace!”

The Divine Palace Master looked indignant, but he didn’t dare to refute.

Time passed quickly.

Twenty-seven years later.

The inner competition of the Hidden Sect ended once again. Li Yao suppressed all the disciples and obtained first place.

When Han Jue learned of this, he called her into the cave abode.

Dao Comprehension Sword was left outside the cave abode. He wanted to talk to Li Yao alone.

Li Yao sat in front of Han Jue and was a little nervous.

When she saw Han Jue’s face again, she couldn’t help but blush.

She recalled the scene when she used the Invocation Technique to summon him. It was unforgettable.

He saved her life. In addition to Han Jue’s kindness and his perfect face, Li Yao admitted that she had feelings for him.

However, feelings of affection couldn’t compare to the Dao Heart. She had no intention of confessing. She only wanted to cultivate well.

“I’m prepared to teach you the Heavenly Sword Dao. Do you want to learn it?” Han Jue asked with a smile.

The more he looked at Li Yao, the more satisfied he was. It was as if he was looking at himself.

Cautious, vigilant, but extremely talented and powerful!

Li Yao’s eyes lit up. “Yes!”

Han Jue didn’t stand on ceremony and immediately taught her the Heavenly Sword Dao.

Half a year later, Li Yao obtained all the inherited memories of the Sword Dao. As for the specific cultivation, it would still take time. Han Jue asked, “What do you think of the Hidden Sect?”

Stunned, Li Yao said, “Not bad. It’s better than the sects I’ve encountered. This is a true cultivation sect. We stay far from distractions and can communicate with each other to improve together.” She spoke from the bottom of her heart. Although the disciples of the Hidden Sect bickered, it never hurt their harmony. They all liked to cultivate diligently and had no ulterior motives.

Oh, other than Duan Hongchen.

He had no choice but to stay on Hidden Sect Island. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Speaking of which, we don’t have a proper status yet. What identity do you want in the Hidden Sect?” Han Jue asked with a smile.

After so many years, Li Yao’s favorability towards him had already increased to 5.5 stars. This favorability was not as simple as taking in a disciple. If he took her in as his companion, she would probably not reject him.

However, Han Jue no longer cared about love. After all, he was already an Immortal Emperor. The primal urge of his body could no longer control him.

Li Yao understood what he meant and said, “You can arrange any identity for me.”

Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

Wow.

This was quite something.

Han Jue said, “Then, let’s do it this way. Try to reach the Emperor Realm as soon as possible.”

Li Yao nodded.

Han Jue waved his hand to signal her to leave. Looking at Li Yao, he sighed. In fact, he didn’t have the same favorable impression of Li Yao as he did of Xing Hongxuan. He only hoped that a Dao Companion would accompany him on the path of cultivation.

From the looks of it, neither Xing Hongxuan, Fairy Xi Xuan, or Chang Yue’er could keep up with him in cultivation.

Han Jue would try his best to help Xing Hongxuan, but doing his best didn’t mean that it would work. Otherwise, how many Immortal Emperor Concubines could the Heavenly Emperor and the Demon Emperor nurture?

It was still fine for a Grand Unity Golden Immortal. The Emperor Realm was the true obstacle. They had to rely on themselves.

Han Jue stopped thinking and continued cultivating

“I wonder how much my lifespan will increase after breaking through to the Rank Seven Immortal Emperor Realm?” Han Jue thought expectantly.

Immortal World, in the seas.

Jing Tiangong stepped on his flying sword and advanced. In front of him was an archipelago. The immortal mist was vast and covered the sky. Countless immortal birds flew in rows and countless disciples flew around.

This was the Jie School’s land!

Jing Tiangong flew all the way to a forest. He continued forward and knelt in front of a stone door.

There was no mountain behind the stone door. It stood alone in the clearing between the trees.

Jing Tiangong kowtowed and bowed. “Sect Master.”

He called out and waited patiently.

After a long while…

A hoarse voice came from the stone door, “What is it?”

Jing Tian said openly, “Recently, a mighty figure called the Dark Forbidden Lord appeared in the Immortal World and controlled the calamity. I don’t know his background. I want to ask Sect Master to deduce.”
