Chapter 1098 Breakthrough Omen

The Primordial Ancestor God had taken less than five steps when the power of the Seven Supreme Rules all added to him, causing his aura to reach its peak, and startling the entire battlefield. The Great Dao Supremes of both sides looked up.

Some Great Dao Divine Spirits were moved and revealed looks of disbelief.

“He’s indeed still alive…”

The Holy Mother of Order looked up at the dazzling Primordial Ancestor God and thought.

The Primordial Ancestor God looked at the tens of thousands of Divine Authority

Generals before looking at the Ultimate God of Punishment.

“He stole my Deity Position and stole my divine generals. He really deserves to die!”

The Primordial Ancestor God snorted and waved his hand. Terrifying Dharmic powers erupted. The supreme power was like a heavenly river that overturned and drowned the Ultimate God of Punishment.

The Ultimate God of Punishment condensed his armor and raised his hand to point. A black pillar of light shot out. Two powerful Dharmic powers collided, causing the space to lose its color. A terrifying storm overturned the Great Dao Supremes.

The battle between the new and old leaders of the Divine Spirits was also a blood feud.

“All of you, continue to destroy the

Primordial Chaos. I will personally deal with this evil devil!” the Ultimate God of Punishment shouted angrily. He displayed his true sharpness at this moment.

He rarely took personal action ever since he took over. He had almost forgotten that he was also warlike.

With that, the Great Dao Supremes of the Chaos continued to attack the Primordial Chaos.

The Primordial Ancestor God was shocked as he fought the Ultimate God of Punishment. He discovered that this fellow could actually mobilize the power of the Supreme Rules. How was this possible?

He hadn’t passed the Deity Position to him.

He couldn’t help but look at the Nine-Headed

Divine Spirit. Could it be him?

Little did he know that the Nine-Headed

Divine Spirit also had mixed emotions.

He also fell into the mortal world after the

Primordial Ancestor God died. Only one

existence could give the Deity Position to the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit.

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit did not dare to

think about that existence.

The Ultimate God of Punishment and the

Primordial Ancestor God fought. It was difficult to tell who was stronger. Both sides

grasped the power of the Supreme Rules, and the Mystical Powers they used were almost identical.

The new Great Dao Divine Spirits were all

secretly shocked. They didn’t expect the Ultimate God of Punishment to be so

powerful.

In the past, they were only used to his status

and did not know how strong he was.

The Ultimate God of Punishment and the Primordial Ancestor God’s power was clearly higher than the power those at the Great Dao Supreme yielded. Be it the Primordial Chaos or the Chaos, they were both shocked.

It was difficult for the two sides to decide the outcome in a short period of time.

At the same time.

Primordial Domain, beside the Primordial

Pool.

Han Huang and Goddess Ming Ji stood side by side looking down at the Primordial Despair.

Goddess Ming Ji asked with lingering fear, “Husband, how long are you going to raise it? It’s already strong enough.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Primordial Despair was sleeping. Even so,

aura emitted made her shiver.

the

She had never felt such a terrifying aura. She even felt that Primordial Despair had already reached her husband’s height.

Han Huang said expressionlessly, “It can’t bring true despair to the Primordial Chaos

yet. We still have to wait.”

“Until when?”

“When the Great Dao Divine Spirit dies.”

“The Great Dao Divine Spirit will die?”

Goddess Ming Ji was shocked. In her opinion, not to mention Great Dao Supremes, even ordinary Great Dao Sages were undying and indestructible. It was very difficult to completely kill them, let alone a Great Dao Divine Spirit recognized by the Supreme

Rules.

Han Huang’s expression was illuminated by

the purple light of the Primordial Pool as he said softly, “Of course. Many will die.” Goddess Ming Ji was puzzled, but she did not ask further. She chose to believe her husband.

“Husband, how confident are you about this Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?”

“I only do what I want to do and do my best. I don’t consider success or failure because I will

only win.”

“Regardless of victory or defeat, I’m willing to follow you in life and death.”

“You might die, and for the sake of my great

cause, I won’t focus on you.”

“Even if I die, I’m willing.” Goddess Ming Ji looked at Han Huang with a gentle expression. Her gaze could be said to be filled with love, causing Han Huang to

frown.

Han Jue opened his eyes.

Ten million years had passed. He was getting closer and closer to the

Creator Lord Realm. He could already sense the barrier.

As long as he broke through that mysterious

barrier, he could welcome a transformation and reach the highest realm that no one had ever reached.

The Ultimate Origin World also expanded at an unprecedented speed in these ten million years, almost doubling in size.

The Purity Great Dao World had already arrived beside the Ultimate Origin World and

was devoured by it. The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity silently endured it. After the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity transformed into an Ultimate Origin Lifeform, the Purity Great Dao World transformed itself into the Ultimate Origin World. The Ultimate Origin Qi washed the internal environment of the Purity Great Dao World.

Han Jue said, “Shan’e, go to the Nine Divine

Stars’ Daoist temple.”

While cursing, Shan’e opened his eyes and hurriedly stood up to leave.

As for why he was chased away, he did not

dare to ask.

He walked very quickly, as if he was in a hurry to curse, afraid that it would delay him.

Han Jue looked at the Chaos. The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity had already erupted completely. Ninety percent of the entire

Chaos was in the flames of war. The Primordial Chaos and the Chaos kept fighting, but in short, the Primordial Chaos was unstoppable and its domain was expanding.

Han Huang had yet to appear, but he suppressed the Chaos with his subordinates and Hidden Sect’s fellow disciples. The Chaotic factions watching the battle couldn’t sit still anymore. They appeared one

after another. Many new factions also rose and participated. Many geniuses born in ten million years were filled with hatred for the Primordial Chaos, causing the Chaos’ cohesion to become stronger and stronger. This was inferior to the Primordial Chaos.

From the looks of it, if Han Huang did not make a move, Primordial Chaos would suffer

its first defeat.

However, Han Jue had already seen Han Huang’s methods. It was a product condensed through the Supreme Rules of the various

Great Dao Worlds. There was indeed hope of overturning the Chaos and bringing despair to

it.

Han Jue was curious. What would the Ninth Chaos do?

If he could see that thing, so could the Ninth

Chaos. It would definitely prepare a backup plan. Once the Ninth Chaos participated, Han Jue would also make a move. Therefore, the Ninth Chaos had to prepare other methods to stop

him.

It was worth mentioning that Li Yao, Xuan Qingjun, and Dao Comprehension Sword had also entered the calamity and went to reinforce the Primordial Chaos. Among them, Li Yao was the most famous. Even Laozi

couldn’t do anything to her.

The current Li Yao was already at the top of

the Chaos. In addition, Han Jue often preached the Dao to her. Her Mystical Power was unfathomable. Ordinary Great Dao Supremes could easily lose to her.

However, a force caught Han Jue’s attention. Dao Heavenly Race!

Pangu and the Dao Ancestor had joined forces to create a new race. This race was also participating in this battle, but they were not only dealing with the Primordial Chaos but also the Chaotic lifeforms.

It seemed that they wanted to take advantage of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity to push the Dao Heavenly Race to the peak.

Han Jue was disdainful. The Dao Heavenly Race was a joke as long as Pangu and the Dao Ancestor didn’t become Dao Creators. No matter how monstrous a race’s potential

was, they had to have a powerful force to support their growth.

It was impossible for the Ninth Chaos to let

them replace the Chaos. Han Jue wouldn’t let

his son die in the hands of the Dao Heavenly

Race.
