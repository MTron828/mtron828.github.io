Chapter 177 Golden Crow’s Breakthrough, Chu Shiren’s Obsession

After sensing that Malevolent Demon Saint’s aura had completely dissipated, Han Jue approached Fang Liang and healed him.

Fang Liang was both surprised and ashamed.

He carefully asked, “Grandmaster, why are you here?”

Han Jue replied, “The Mystical Power I taught you is a summoning technique. Don’t tell anyone about this, including your master.”

Fang Liang was enlightened. His admiration for Han Jue was like an endless river. It was indescribable.

Han Jue raised his hand and sucked Ji Xianshen over.

Under the treatment of his Heaven Immortal Dharmic powers, their injuries quickly recovered.

Fortunately, their essence souls were not injured. Malevolent Demon Saint did not seem to want to kill them.

Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to think about the Demon Saint’s plot. He would deal with it using the Book of Misfortune when he returned.

Ji Xianshen looked at him with a complicated expression and asked, “You’re already an immortal. Why can you stay in the mortal world?”

Han Jue smiled teasingly. “If you acknowledge me as your master, I’ll teach you.”

“Hmph!”

Ji Xianshen turned his head away.

He couldn’t help but ponder.

Han Jue was indeed much stronger than his master.

But emotionally, he couldn’t accept it. He had always treated Han Jue as his brother and competitor.

“Go back as soon as possible. The Demon Realm is not so easily bullied.”

Han Jue stood up and walked into the black crack, returning to the Connate Cave Abode. He could only enter this crack. If Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang followed, they would be lost in the void without the connection of the Invocation Technique.

After Han Jue left, Fang Liang and Ji Xianshen fell silent.

Fang Liang smiled teasingly. “Who’s the number one in the world?”

“Hmph, let’s go back. Otherwise, that fellow will come back and find trouble with us

again.”

“Mm.”

The two of them immediately stood up and left.

Along the way, they discussed Han Jue’s strength.

After returning to the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and began cursing Malevolent Demon Saint.

A Grand Unity Heaven Immortal could be called a Demon Saint in the Upper World. From the looks of it, a Demon Saint was not very strong.

Han Jue thought silently.

Dao Comprehension Sword asked curiously, “Master, where did you go just now? Why do you have Little Liang’s aura on you?”

Han Jue replied, “I went to save him. This kid was together with Ji Xianshen and was almost beaten to death. Look, it’s very dangerous outside. Don’t go out.”

Dao Comprehension Sword frowned.

Fang Liang was already very strong, and Ji Xianshen was even the number one in the world. The two of them were almost beaten to death even when working together?

It seemed that she really couldn’t go to the outside world!

Dao Comprehension Sword perked up and continued cultivating.

Han Jue cursed as he observed Chu Shiren under the Fusang Tree.

This fellow didn’t cultivate after coming up the mountain!

Crazy!

If he doesn’t cultivate, why is he here to become my disciple?

It was strange. The reincarnation of Buddha actually cultivated the Dao. He was probably a traitor.

The Buddhist Sect wanted to take drastic measures against the Dao Sect?

Han Jue had always been observing Chu Shiren and did not dare to nurture him easily.

Should I ask my good brother about the Supreme Buddha?

Han Jue felt that it was feasible.

He would ask next time. After all, Chu Shiren didn’t want to cultivate.

When he was about to die of old age, he would definitely be anxious.

Thinking of Chu Shiren, Han Jue thought of Xun Chang’an, this ugly monk

It had been so many years, why hadn’t he returned?

It’s a pity that my grand-disciple has to suffer every day.

Ever since he had gone out with Xun Chang’an, Murong Qi had been attacked countless times and had been severely injured.

Compared to Xun Chang’an, Han Jue’s heart ached for Murong Qi.

Murong Qi was good, cheerful, and had respect for this Grandmaster.

Xun Chang’an was autistic all the time and would think of Qian’er whenever he wanted to. Han Jue even wanted to expel him from the sect.

However, considering that this was a curse from the Divine Buddha, he could only endure.

It was unknown how long it would take for Xun Chang’an to escape this calamity.

This fellow definitely couldn’t rely on himself. When Han Jue reached the same level as the Divine Buddha, he would personally break the curse.

Thinking of this, Han Jue shook his head and laughed.

Thirteen years later.

Under the Fusang Tree, Chu Shiren was already old.

He had white hair and a thin figure. He leaned against a tree trunk and looked at the sky with a blank expression. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Yang Tiandong opened his eyes and frowned. This kid…

“Hey, hey, kid, how many more years can you live? Do you have any unfulfilled wishes?” The Black Hell Chicken asked with a smile.

It was only joking. Chu Shiren was a Foundation Establishment realm cultivator, after all. It wasn’t difficult for him to live for nearly 200 years. It was just that he hadn’t taken the Youth Retaining Pill, so he looked old.

The Three-Headed Wyrm King laughed mockingly. “His wish is probably very difficult to fulfill. He wants the world to give up cultivating. I even suspect that he’s a spy sent by the demons.”

Hearing this, Chu Shiren suddenly turned around and said in a low voice, “Only if the people of the world give up on cultivating can the order of reincarnation return to normal. As for the demons, the Heavenly Dao will not tolerate them when the time comes. We can only control our own actions.”

Tu Ling’er asked, “Then why did you cultivate to the Foundation Establishment realm?”

“I… I’m doing this for the Great Kindness Dharmic Dao!”

“Hypocrite.”

“You…”

Chu Shiren was about to explode in anger.

Ever since he had arrived at the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain, his good temper had been worn out.

These people were too despicable!

Not only did they not agree with him, but they also kept mocking him.

At this moment…

The door to the Connate Cave Abode opened and Han Jue and Dao Comprehension Sword walked out.

Upon seeing him, everyone stood up and bowed.

Chu Shiren was stunned. This was the first time he saw Han Jue.

What a handsome face!

He had thought that Deity Slaying Elder was an old man.

Han Jue walked in front of the Fusang Tree and looked up at the two Golden Crows. “Can you break through?”

Ah Da nodded and said, “Yes, but we’re afraid of being expelled by the Heavenly Dao, so we didn’t dare to.”

Han Jue threw out two Heaven Evading Stones, one of which was given to him by Deliveryman Yang.

“With these two stones, you won’t have to transcend the tribulation. As long as you don’t leave this mountain in the future, you won’t be expelled by the Heavenly Dao.”

Hearing this, the two Golden Crows were overjoyed. They hurriedly bit on the Heaven Evading Stone and started cultivating.

The others immediately understood something.

Han Jue had long surpassed the mortal world! He had relied on those two stones to stay in the mortal world!

Han Jue looked at the Three-Headed Wyrm King and waved his right hand. He handed the Abyss Yellow Dragon’s soul to him and said, “This is the soul of a True Dragon. Its consciousness has been erased by me. After you devour it, your bloodline should be able to transform. You don’t have to worry about being possessed.”

The Three-Headed Wyrm King was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly kowtowed to Han Jue.

Chu Shiren was stunned.

Han Jue deliberately provoked him.

You want to persuade me to give up cultivating?

I’ll help others become stronger in front of you!

Yang Tiandong, Tu Ling’er, the Black Hell Chicken, and the Chaotic Heavenly Dog looked at him expectantly.

Han Jue said angrily, “Your cultivation is so low, why are you looking at me? Let’s talk when you’re close to the peak of the mortal world!”

Dao Comprehension Sword followed suit. “That’s right, that’s right. None of you are cultivating properly!” Han Jue turned around and returned to his cave abode.

Chu Shiren hurriedly ran over, knelt behind him, and shouted, “Grandmaster, please take the lead and give up cultivating!” Yang Tiandong almost peed his pants when he heard that. He rushed over and kicked him to the ground.

“What nonsense are you saying!” Yang Tiandong shouted, trembling in anger.

This kid is really daring!

He really dared to persuade Han Jue!

Han Jue turned his head and looked at Chu Shiren from the corner of his eye. “Anyone in this world can persuade others to give up cultivating, but you can’t.”

Chu Shiren got up and wiped the blood from his mouth, asking, “Why?”

He stared at Han Jue without fear.
