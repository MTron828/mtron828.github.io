Chapter 265 Li Xuan’ao, Li Daokong

“Why is this dog back?”

Han Jue opened his eyes and snorted coldly. His tone was filled with disdain.

The other disciples had their own backgrounds, only the Chaotic Heavenly Dog was obtained from the system by him.

Han Jue actually cared about the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, but this fellow was too reckless. Every time he went out, he would be beaten up and refused to return. “Its eyes were dug out…” Dao Comprehension Sword said carefully.

Han Jue frowned.

He immediately swept his divine sense out. At that moment, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog was surrounded by the people from the Hidden Sect.

It lay on the ground, its aura weak and emaciated. It didn’t have its previous arrogance and looked very miserable.

The Black Hell Chicken exploded in anger and cursed. “Stupid dog, who tortured you like this?”

Although it was cursing, it was clearly very concerned about the Chaotic Heavenly Dog.

After all, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog was hatched by it. It was equivalent to its child.

The Chaotic Heavenly Dog sighed. “Stop asking… I won’t go out again…”

The others frowned.

Long Hao said in a low voice, “Who is it? Tell me, I’ll help you take revenge!”

He had always promised to protect the Hidden Sect. Having lived for so long, this was the first time he had encountered such a miserable fellow disciple.

“Forget it… There’s really no need…” The Chaotic Heavenly Dog shook its head. It was clearly afraid.

Everyone was very curious. What had the Chaotic Heavenly Dog experienced that made it so afraid?

In the past, this dog was the most arrogant. The Chaotic Heavenly Dog scanned the area and suddenly asked, “Where’s Yang Tiandong? He went out to train again?”

Everyone spread their hands, indicating that they did not know either.

“Yang Tiandong has been in the reincarnation cycle for hundreds of years.”

Han Jue’s voice suddenly sounded.

Everyone was stunned.

Yang Tiandong was dead? They were all shocked. Han Jue didn’t mention it before.

No wonder he didn’t come back.

“Chaotic Heavenly Dog, come in. The others can continue cultivating.” Han Jue’s voice floated over again. Immediately after, Dao Comprehension Sword walked out of the cave abode.

The Chaotic Heavenly Dog was uneasy as it carefully walked towards the cave abode.

Although its eyes were gone, its divine sense was still there.

After it entered the cave abode, the others exploded.

The Chaotic Heavenly Dog’s eyes were gouged out and Yang Tiandong died!

It’s so dangerous outside?

Inside the Connate Cave Abode. The Chaotic Heavenly Dog sprawled in front of Han Jue, not daring to look up as its body trembled.

Han Jue frowned. He caught a mysterious force in the Chaotic Heavenly Dog’s eye sockets, preventing it from regrowing its eyes.

“Who injured you?”

If the Chaotic Heavenly Dog didn’t provoke the other party, Han Jue would uphold justice.

The Chaotic Heavenly Dog hesitated, afraid that it would cause trouble for him.

Han Jue asked, “The other party is an Immortal Emperor. Are you afraid that I can’t defeat him?”

Previously, it was shown that the Chaotic Heavenly Dog had been captured by a mighty figure, which meant that it was an Immortal Emperor!

The Chaotic Heavenly Dog suddenly looked up in shock.

How did Master know?

In the Chaotic Heavenly Dog’s opinion, although Han Jue was powerful, he had always been in the mortal world and did not know much about the Immortal World. Ever since it was captured in the Immortal World, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog knew how tiny the mortal world was.

This was also the reason why it did not dare to speak about the real culprit. The other party was too strong.

So powerful that it didn’t dare to hate them.

Han Jue snorted coldly. With a wave of his right hand, he extracted the power from the Chaotic Heavenly Dog’s eye socket and extinguished it.

(Li Xuan’ao has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 1 star.]

Li Xuan’ao?

Surprised, Han Jue hurriedly checked his interpersonal relationships.

(Li Xuan’ao: Cultivation unknown. The second disciple of the Human School who travels the heavens and collects providence. He wants to lead Human School to prosperity. Because you wiped away the power he left on the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, he is interested in you. Current Hatred Points: 1 star.]

.

Eh?

Interested? How was it hatred points, then?

Han Jue cursed silently.

Previously, the Heavenly Emperor had mentioned that the two disciples of the Human School were about to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In other words, Li Xuan’ao was at the Deity Realm at the very least!

Han Jue’s heart sank. Seeing that the Chaotic Heavenly Dog refused to say anything, he said, “Go out and cultivate well. From now on, you are not allowed to go

out.”

The Chaotic Heavenly Dog heaved a sigh of relief and hurriedly fled the Connate Cave Abode.

He continued to cultivate.

After the Chaotic Heavenly Dog returned, its temperament changed drastically. It was no longer arrogant. Instead, it became passionate about cultivation. No matter how the Black Hell Chicken cursed it, it would smile and not dare to retort.

It had really been taught a lesson by society.

Another ten years passed. Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and smiled strangely.

He had endured for ten years!

It was cursing time!

Han Jue started cursing Li Xuan’ao.

Although he couldn’t curse him to death, Han Jue still wanted to mess with him.

How dare you dig out the eyes of my divine pet! This is not over!

Han Jue decided to spend five days a year cursing. He would destroy this fellow’s Dao heart!

Just like that.

Year after year passed. Thirty years passed.

Han Jue saw an email.

(Because of your curse, the Human School’s Li Xuan’ao developed mental demons.]

Han Jue was so happy that he couldn’t close his mouth.

Great!

Very good. Since he had a mental demon, Han Jue would curse him every ten years.

Han Jue thought that the constant cursing would affect his cultivation.

In the forest.

A white-robed man sat under a tree. He looked to be in his forties and had a calm temperament. A wooden sword floated beside him.

He was the Human School’s Li Xuan’ao.

At this moment, Li Xuan’ao frowned. There was a murderous aura between his brows.

He suddenly opened his eyes and said in a low voice, “You’re going too far! Don’t let me find you!”

That damned curse haunted him like a nightmare. Most importantly, he couldn’t even predict its existence.

“Junior, has your cultivation been affected recently?”

A gentle laugh sounded. Countless leaves fell and circled in front of Li Xuan’ao, forming a figure.

This person wore a green Daoist robe. He had a sword at his waist and a grass rope tied to his forehead. His black hair fluttered and he had a handsome face.

Upon seeing him, Li Xuan’ao couldn’t help but snort. “What are you doing here?”

This person was the eldest disciple of the Human School, Li Daokong. Li Daokong smiled. “The Immeasurable Calamity is about to begin. I’m worried that you want to get involved.”

Li Xuan’ao snorted. “So what if I’m involved? Are you afraid that if I die, you’ll die too?”

“Brat, how can you think of me like that?”

“Stop pretending to be a good person. Others might not know about you, but I know deeply.”

Li Daokong smiled and didn’t say anything else. He stared at Li Xuan’ao and suddenly narrowed his eyes. “Have you been cursed?”

Li Xuan’ao’s expression instantly turned ashen. “None of your business!”

Li Daokong raised his right hand and pointed at him.

Li Xuan’ao instinctively raised his hand to block, but he was still struck. His robes fluttered as the murderous aura between his brows dissipated.

“His cultivation…”

Li Xuan’ao frowned, feeling extremely indignant.

He had always wanted to surpass his senior, but the difference between the two of them was becoming greater and greater.

They were clearly at the same cultivation realm, so why was there such a huge difference in strength?

“The Heavenly Emperor invited me to the Heavenly Court to preach the Dao. During this period of time, don’t run out. Otherwise, you might be used by others and become someone who will face the calamity,” Li Daokong said solemnly.

Li Xuan’ao said angrily, “Do you really think I’m ignorant? Besides, how many people in the Immortal World are my match?”

Li Daokong said, “You’ve been cursed recently and even developed mental demons. From your attitude, it’s obvious that you don’t even know who the other party is.”

Li Xuan’ao’s expression darkened.
