Chapter 189 Heavenly Emperor’s Sigh, Ranking in the Myriad Worlds

Sever the River of Destiny?

So powerful? Although Han Jue had grasped the Heavenly Sword Dao, he wasn’t that strong.

This was normal. No matter how powerful a Mystical Power was, it still depended on one’s cultivation level.

Han Jue asked curiously, “What’s the River of Destiny? Is it like the Sword Dao River? It doesn’t exist on the surface but in a deeper space?”

Di Taibai replied, “That’s right. The River of Destiny holds the destiny of everyone. If it’s broken, all lives will be lost. Therefore, this is a taboo. All forces have to maintain it.”

Han Jue was deep in thought. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

This cultivation path was more complicated than he had imagined.

“When you master the Heavenly Sword Dao, remember to tell me. I have to tell His Majesty about this and make him happy.” Di Taibai stroked his beard and smiled.

Han Jue hesitated.

Should he come clean?

If his talent was too exaggerated, would it attract the Heavenly Emperor’s fear?

But on second thought, who was the Heavenly Emperor?

Would he fear a junior? If that was the case, how could the Divine General from back then survive?

There was no need to hide!

Han Jue said, “To be honest, I’ve already grasped the Heavenly Sword Dao.”

Di Taibai smiled and said, “Not bad, not bad. You learned… what? You mastered it? Stop bragging!”

This leader of the Literature Immortals couldn’t remain calm!

Impossible!

That was the Heavenly Sword Dao!

Han Jue said helplessly, “I can’t prove it by attacking you, right? Besides, the mortal world can’t endure such a commotion. If you don’t believe me, we can go to the void to affirm it.”

Above the mortal world was the starry sky. Above the starry sky was not the Immortal World, but a void with nothing

Di Taibai immediately said, “Let’s go!”

He waved his right hand. In a flash, Han Jue arrived in a dark space. There was no light, but the two of them were immortals. Their bodies emitted a faint divine light.

“Use your Heavenly Sword Dao against me with all your might,” Di Taibai said. Han Jue didn’t hold back.

Five minutes later.

The void returned to tranquility.

Di Taibai looked at him with a complicated expression.

Han Jue was the same.

This fellow was actually a sword cultivator.

Wait.

Could it be that the sword immortal that Di Taibai had bragged about earlier was himself?

Crap.

In that case, didn’t I slap him in the face?

It was not my intention!

Han Jue only wanted to gain benefits and become stronger. He didn’t want to gain enemies.

Fortunately, Di Taibai was not a petty person. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have changed from 1-star Hatred Points to 3-star Favorability.

Di Taibai sighed. “I underestimated you. His Majesty also underestimated you.”

[Di Taibai’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 4 stars]

Han Jue hesitated. “About this…”

Di Taibai smiled and said, “Don’t worry. In this world, only you, me, and His Majesty will know. No fourth person will find out.”

Han Jue was completely relieved and smiled.

“I will immediately inform His Majesty about this. This is the fortune of our Heavenly Court!”

Di Taibai smiled and sent him back to his cave abode.

Next, he returned to Heavenly Court.

Han Jue didn’t think too much and continued cultivating.

Dao Comprehension Sword returned to the cave abode. She pouted and asked, “Who was that old man?”

Han Jue replied, “What does that have to do with you?”

“I…”

“Have you learned the Heavenly Sword Dao?” “It’s so difficult… I have yet to comprehend it.” “Then why aren’t you working hard? There’s nothing to think about all day. I only used less than half a year for the first level of the Heavenly Sword Dao. What about you? It’s been twenty years!”

“I was wrong…”

Dao Comprehension Sword was ashamed. She felt that her aptitude was too poor and she had let him down.

Han Jue snorted. “You must master it within a hundred years. Otherwise, I won’t teach you the next levels.”

“Alright!”

Dao Comprehension Sword’s fighting spirit was ignited and her eyes lit up.

Although the Heavenly Sword Dao was vast and profound, ever since she started learning it, her cultivation speed and strength had steadily increased.

Most importantly, Han Jue didn’t teach this Sword Dao to anyone.

Dao Comprehension Sword felt that she was receiving special treatment and was naturally in a good mood.

Numinous Palace.

The Heavenly Emperor was moved. “It’s only been 25 years, but he has already grasped the Heavenly Sword Dao?”

Di Taibai suppressed his excitement and said, “That’s right. I’ve already tested it. It’s indeed the Heavenly Sword Dao. He can even use the Immortal Slaying Sword Formation!”

The Heavenly Emperor was in a daze. The hall fell silent.

Di Taibai didn’t dare to disturb the Heavenly Emperor’s thoughts and remained silent.

There were only the two of them in the hall.

After a long while…

The Heavenly Emperor sighed. “I really underestimated him.”

Di Taibai also smiled and said, “Your Majesty is truly wise. You spared his life. Otherwise, he would have died decades ago.”

The Heavenly Emperor smiled.

“There’s a Fusang Tree on the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain. Let’s give him some immortal water that can help the tree to grow. As for Dao techniques, we won’t give them for the time being. This kid’s cultivation technique is not simple. He probably obtained the inheritance of an Immortal Emperor,” the Heavenly Emperor said.

Di Taibai said in surprise, “An Immortal Emperor’s inheritance? Then, are we…”

The Heavenly Emperor waved his sleeve. “Hmph, which Immortal Emperor can compare to me? Besides, Han Jue has too little karma. I guess that Immortal Emperor doesn’t care about him. Ten thousand years later, even if that Immortal Emperor gets tempted, will Han Jue listen to him or me?

“Don’t keep thinking about potential danger. We need to invest first. Prodigies like Han Jue and the Divine General will definitely not be willing to submit to others. When Han Jue becomes an Immortal Emperor himself, how can he put another Immortal Emperor in his eyes?”

Di Taibai was filled with admiration and hurriedly bowed.

Seeming to have thought of something, he said, “A mortal named Ji Xianshen ascended. He has a karmic relationship with Han Jue. Previously, they agreed to fight against the Heavenly Troops.”

The Heavenly Emperor said, “Arrange for him to get a Heavenly General position. He will be given seventh-grade treatment. Tell him not to reveal anything about Han Jue.”

“Understood!”

In the blink of an eye, another seven years passed.

Di Taibai had sent some immortal water to the Fusang Tree during this period. There were a total of seven bottles, which could help the Fusang Tree grow faster. One bottle would be used every ten years.

Han Jue was very happy. His favorability towards the Heavenly Emperor increased greatly. He personally watered the Fusang Tree with immortal water.

On this day.

Han Jue thought of the Heavenly Dao Token.

He was now considered an Immortal God, but he had yet to make the Heavenly Dao Token recognize him as its master. That was quite irresponsible. The process of using a soul mark to make the token recognize him as its master was not complicated. In less than two hours, Han Jue grasped the Heavenly Dao Token. At the same time, he sensed the Heavenly Dao in the mortal world.

It was the starry sky of the universe above the sky. It was like a painting that enveloped the mortal world.

Through the Heavenly Dao Token, Han Jue could look down on the entire world and even see every mortal. He tried to look at Zhou Fan and quickly caught sight of him.

Zhou Fan was cultivating in a Holy Land.

He looked at his other friends and easily found them.

Is this the feeling of an Immortal God? How satisfying! Han Jue’s divine sense caught a stone tablet in the Heavenly Dao Token and stood in the darkness. After his divine sense entered the stone tablet, a huge amount of information entered his consciousness.

It was actually the ranking of the Myriad Worlds!

Han Jue’s mortal world was called the Scarlet Cloud World. It was probably named by Chi Yunxian. It was ranked 4,932. It was not a high ranking, nor was it too low. There were more than 9,000 mortal worlds.

There are still rankings among the mortal worlds?

Interesting.

Han Jue didn’t think too much about it. He couldn’t be bothered to help the Scarlet Cloud World climb up in ranking. This was good. Being in the middle meant it was not eye-catching.

It was unknown how the ranking was calculated.

He had to ask Di Taibai when he had the chance.
