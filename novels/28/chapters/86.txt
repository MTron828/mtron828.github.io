Chapter 87: Devil Master, Xiao Yao’s Challenge

Ninth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm?

The number one prodigy of the Heavenly Immortal Manor five thousand years ago!

The only survivor of the Ancient Spiritual Firmament Sect!

Both eyes were blinded by heavenly punishment!

It was just one line of words, but Han Jue was like “wow”.

Even with this sort of background, he was actually not a bearer of Connate providence.

Han Jue asked, “Have you heard of the Spiritual Firmament Sect?”

Li Qingzi replied, “I’ve heard of it. It’s said to be a large sect from five thousand years ago. However, it offended the Immortal Gods and misfortune befell them from the heavens. The entire sect was annihilated. Elder Han, why are you asking about the Spiritual Firmament Sect? Could it be that the ruins we found are from this sect?”

Han Jue nodded. “I made some deductions. This person’s name is Xiao Yao, and he’s from the Spiritual Firmament Sect.”

Li Qingzi’s eyes widened and he gasped.

He had never heard of Xiao Yao, but he had heard of the Spiritual Firmament Sect.

“What do we do now? Abandon the ruins?” Li Qingzi asked cautiously.

He was afraid they would find trouble for no reason. He only hoped that the Jade Pure Sect could develop peacefully. As long as the sect was given time, it would grow stronger sooner or later and become a large sect like the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect and the Formless Sect.

Han Jue replied, “It’s up to you. If it’s easy to be punished by the heavens, it should have come long ago. I think that as long as the Spiritual Firmament Sect doesn’t reappear in the world, the treasures are safe.”

Li Qingzi nodded. It would be difficult for him to give up the resources. After all, the elders had already divided up a lot.

“Forget about Xiao Yao for the time being. Just continue with life. We can’t force a horse to drink water, after all,” Han Jue added.

Li Qingzi had no objections. Hearing that Xiao Yao was from the Spiritual Firmament Sect, his first reaction was to expel him.

But on second thought, he couldn’t defeat him. How could he expel him?

Then, Li Qingzi left.

Han Jue began to use the simulation trial against Xiao Yao.

Ten seconds later.

Han Jue opened his eyes and looked surprised.

“This fellow is something. His Mystical Power is too evasive,” Han Jue muttered.

Xiao Yao could split into tens of thousands of clones, so Han Li could not kill him immediately.

He was considered powerful since he could last ten seconds under him.

Han Jue continued the simulation trial.

He wanted to find a way to kill Xiao Yao.

It felt like he was looking for a strategy to kill monsters. Han Jue was happy.

Five minutes later, he finally found a way to kill Xiao Yao as soon as possible.

However, as soon as the fight started, Xiao Yao used his cloning technique.

After understanding his strength, Han Jue became more interested in him.

If such an expert joined the Jade Pure Sect, he would be able to cultivate in peace.

Then, Han Jue opened the emails.

[Your disciple Su Qi was captured by the Devil Master.]

[Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck. The fate of the Devil Master and his descendants has decreased.]

[Your disciple Yang Tiandong was attacked by beasts] x3872

[Your divine pet, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, was attacked by a ferocious beast. It was severely injured but managed to escape.]

[Your good friend Zhou Fan has awakened the Mystical Power of his previous life. His strength has increased greatly.]

[Your good friend Guan Yougang was attacked by a fiendish cultivator] x2

[Your divine pet, the Black Hell Chicken, has devoured the Divine Beast Zhu Dou. Its bloodline has transformed. It has obtained the providence of calamity.]

[Your good friend Daoist Calm Sky was attacked by a righteous cultivator] x5823

…

Daoist Calm Sky came from the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect and was attacked by so many people. It looked like the war between the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect and the Formless Sect had already begun.

Su Qi and Yang Tiandong also encountered trouble.

Han Jue wasn’t worried about Su Qi at all. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

As for Yang Tiandong, it was obvious that he had left the Great Yan. No demon in the Great Yan would dare to attack the demon king’s adopted son.

The Chaotic Heavenly Dog had suffered retribution. It hadn’t been beaten recently, so it was likely hiding somewhere to recuperate.

He hoped that it would come to its senses and return soon.

Han Jue shook his head and laughed, then continued cultivating.

At the second level of the Body Integration Realm, Han Jue was no longer afraid of the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect and the Formless Sect. However, even if he was not in danger, he had to worry about the future.

Han Jue was afraid that the Vermilion Bird would break into the mortal world at any time. He had to hurry up and cultivate. He couldn’t slack off.

…

Deep in a dark valley, Su Qi sat in a corner nervously looking at a figure in the distance.

The person was surrounded by demonic Qi. His face was frightening and covered in blood-colored scales. It was ghastly and terrifying.

Su Qi gritted his teeth. “Devil Master, I’m only a mortal. Please let me go!”

The Devil Master kept his eyes closed as he meditated.

Su Qi was angry but didn’t dare to say anything.

After a while, the Devil Master said leisurely, “Kid, if I wanted to kill you, you would already be dead. The fact that you’re still alive means this is a fortuitous encounter for you. Just wait patiently.”

Fortuitous encounter?

Su Qi widened his eyes and carefully said, “You want to teach me your ultimate technique?”

He was excited. Was this a blessing in disguise?

“Perhaps. I can’t read your fate, which shows that you have extraordinary providence. Perhaps you can inherit my legacy. If I can’t fulfill my wish in the future, I’ll hand it to you,” the Devil Master replied nonchalantly.

Su Qi asked, “What wish?”

“Massacre the humans.”

Su Qi was stunned.

As expected of the Devil Master!

If that’s the case, then I’ll hide here and find a chance to kill him! Su Qi thought silently.

He had always thought of himself as a kind person. Back then, he had joined the Jade Pure Sect because he thought that it was a righteous sect.

He even felt that Han Jue had sent him to hide in the Demon Taming Sect because he wanted to enforce justice on behalf of the heavens. After joining it, he discovered that this sect was indeed cruel, evil, and that the heavens did not tolerate it.

Su Qi took a deep breath, his eyes becoming determined.

No matter what, Master must be secretly protecting me. I can’t let him down.

…

Time passed quickly.

Ten years passed in the blink of an eye.

Han Jue was still a little short of the third level of the Body Integration Realm. He originally planned to break through to the third level in one go before resting, but the Fusang Tree started shaking again.

The previous time, it had attracted the Divine Beast Zhu Dou. What would it attract this time?

Han Jue couldn’t help but tense up.

This couldn’t go on.

What should he do?

He suddenly thought of the Black Hell Chicken.

If the chicken occupied the Fusang Tree, would the other beasts and divine beasts not come anymore?

Han Jue immediately instructed the Black Hell Chicken to move to the Fusang Tree.

After eating the Zhu Dou, the Black Hell Chicken’s cultivation had already soared to the ninth level of the Soul Formation Realm. It was only a step away from the Void Amalgamation Realm.

This was simply cheating!

However, on careful thought, it made sense. The Zhu Dou might be a divine beast, but the Black Hell Chicken was a reincarnated Demon Saint of the Upper World.

After receiving the order, the Black Hell Chicken did not resist and was even excited. It quickly flew to the Fusang Tree and sat on the trunk like a rooster hatching an egg.

A few days later, when the Fusang Tree stopped shaking, Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

He was about to continue cultivating when he suddenly sensed an aura. It was at the bottom of the mountain, sitting in front of the stone tablet that had formed the immortal mountain.

It was the blind Xiao Yao!

Han Jue thought for a moment and asked with a voice transmission, “What’s the matter, Fellow Daoist?”

Xiao Yao’s hair was white, but his face was very young. He seemed to be in his thirties. His eyelids were black and shriveled. He was wearing a tattered Daoist robe and leaning against the stone tablet as if he was napping.

Upon hearing Han Jue’s voice transmission, he stretched lazily, slowly stood up, and said, “Your Sect Master has always been inviting me to join the sect. I’ve stayed in the Jade Pure Sect for a period of time. You’re the strongest Deity Slaying Elder, right? I don’t mind joining the sect. If you can represent the Jade Pure Sect to withstand a palm strike from me, I’ll join you guys.”
