Chapter 276 Two Emperors of the Hidden Sect, Shock of the War God

“Go ahead,” Han Jue replied casually. The reason why he let the White-Robed Buddha in was that he sensed that he was about to reach the Emperor Realm, so he wanted to use the Black Hell Demon Lord to intimidate him.

The White-Robed Buddha said, “During this period of time, I have to head to the void to avoid harming the mortal world. But I’m afraid…”

Han Jue interrupted, “Try your best to become an Immortal Emperor. I can take care of you as long as you don’t leave the Reroll World!”

The White-Robed Buddha was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly kowtowed.

“In the future, you will be a Hidden Sect disciple. How about that?” Han Jue asked as he stared at him.

The White-Robed Buddha immediately promised, “From now on, I’m a disciple of the Hidden Sect. Buddhist Sect? Chan School? If they offend you, they will be my enemy!” Han Jue smiled in satisfaction and waved his hand, signaling that he could leave. After the White-Robed Buddha became an Emperor, the Hidden Sect would have two Immortal Emperors!

It could be considered a major force in the Immortal World.

Han Jue began to test the experts near the Reroll World. Fortunately, there were no strong enemies.

Since there were no strong enemies, he could cultivate in peace.

The White-Robed Buddha headed into the void and began to meditate. He didn’t immediately transcend the tribulation. Instead, he needed to prepare for a period of time.

Several months later.

Di Taibai contacted Han Jue through the Heavenly Dao Token.

Before his divine sense could speak, Di Taibai spoke first, “Something’s wrong! The Golden Crow Divine Clan is actually supporting the Demon Court and is beginning to engulf the mortal worlds below the Heavenly Court. More than ten mortal worlds have already been destroyed by them. You have to be careful. If you really can’t, you can come to the Heavenly Court!”

Golden Crow Divine Clan?

Han Jue asked in surprise, “Can the Demon Court and the Golden Crow Divine Clan sweep through the myriad worlds?”

Di Taibai said helplessly, “Too many races in the Immortal World belong to the demon race. The number of demons far exceeds that of the human race. I didn’t expect the Demon Emperor to secretly match up so many races. It seems that he has long been harboring ulterior motives!”

Han Jue showed a frown.

The Golden Crow Divine Clan was very strong! Previously, when they fought against the Divine Palace, they were extremely powerful.

Han Jue couldn’t help but think of the two Golden Crows and their mother, Di Hongye.

He wondered if he could use this relationship to avoid them.

“Thank you for your reminder, Senior. I have to stay behind to protect the Reroll World!”

It’s impossible for me to go to the Heavenly Court. Never in this life.

Creating havoc in Heavenly Court was an achievement. Who knew how many people wanted to obtain it? It was truly dangerous there.

“Then, you have to be careful. His Majesty has left the Heavenly Court for a period of time, and I don’t know when he will return. Sigh, that’s all!”

Di Taibai quickly severed his divine sense connection.

Han Jue couldn’t help but worry when he heard that the Heavenly Emperor had left.

Did something happen?

He quickly checked the emails.

(Your good friend Divine General was attacked by your good friend Di Hongye,] (Your good friend Tai Sutian has arrived at Buzhou Divine Mountain.]

(Your good friend Huang Jihao was attacked by a Heavenly General and was severely injured. Fortunately, your enemy Li Xuan’ao saved him.]

(Your good friend Pan Xin was sent into the endless purgatory by a mighty figure.]

(Your grand-disciple Murong Qi has left the Immortal World.)

[Your disciple Su Qi has left the Immortal World.)

(Your good friend Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mighty figure] x7

The Heavenly Emperor was indeed attacked! The Divine General was even attacked by Di Hongye. Why did it feel like the Demon Court was targeting the Heavenly Court?

There was no movement from the Divine Palace and Buddhist Sect?

Han Jue looked down and saw that the Sword God Emperor was attacked by a demon mighty figure. He immediately felt relieved.

Since the Divine Palace was also being beaten, that was fine.

Han Jue was afraid that the myriad worlds would besiege the Heavenly Court. If that happened, the Heavenly Court would definitely not be able to withstand it.

Too dangerous!

Was this the Immeasurable Calamity?

He wouldn’t have to worry so much if he was a Zenith Heaven.

He was still too weak.

Han Jue took a deep breath and stopped thinking about it. He continued cultivating.

Eight years later, the White-Robed Buddha began his tribulation.

The tribulation of an Immortal Emperor was extremely terrifying. Even the living beings in the mortal world could sense it.

The Emperor Tribulation Thundercloud covered an area larger than the Reroll World. Fortunately, the heavenly might only made everyone uneasy and did not affect their lives.

Han Jue looked at the void, speechless.

This is the Heavenly Tribulation of the Emperor Realm?

How terrifying!

It felt like an ordinary Rank One Immortal Emperor couldn’t withstand it!

It seemed like the White-Robed Buddha was about to suffer.

Han Jue thought silently. The might of the Emperor Tribulation was too great. He didn’t know if it would attract a mighty figure.

He could only pray that the White-Robed Buddha did not have many enemies.

Half a year later.

The Tribulation continued.

Two figures flew over from the end of the void. They were Murong Qi and Su Qi. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The two of them descended into the mortal world. They met on the way and returned together. “Someone is transcending the tribulation up ahead!” Murong Qi suddenly said and raised his hand to stop Su Qi.

Su Qi stopped and looked up. Heavenly tribulation rumbled at the end of the void. Countless strange purple lightning and golden lightning flashed. It was an extremely spectacular sight. “What realm is this? This pressure…” Su Qi asked with widened eyes.

Murong Qi’s expression was grave as he said, “Immortal Emperor! This person is the White-Robed Buddha of the Buddhist Sect!”

Su Qi asked nervously, “If an Immortal Emperor is transcending his tribulation here without restraint, what’s wrong with the mortal world?”

His heart sank.

Murong Qi was also a little worried.

The two of them immediately circled around and quickly entered the Reroll World.

Realizing that there were no disasters in the mortal world, they hurriedly rushed to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.

With their current cultivation levels, they quickly arrived under the Fusang Tree.

“Where’s Master? I want to see Master. An Immortal Emperor is transcending the tribulation outside!” Su Qi hurriedly said as he walked towards the Connate Cave Abode.

Murong Qi suddenly pulled him back. Su Qi said angrily, “Why are you stopping me again?”

Murong Qi took a deep breath and said, “It should be fine. There’s another Immortal Emperor besides him.”

Su Qi couldn’t help but turn around and see the cultivating Black Hell Demon Lord.

The Black Hell Demon Lord opened one eye and smiled teasingly. “I was wondering who it was. So it’s Profound Truth Divine Emperor.”

It really was the War God!

Previously, he had heard Xun Chang’an brag that his disciple was the reincarnation of a War God. He had even disdained it. True War Gods were all geniuses. Would they become his disciple?

Unexpectedly, it was true!

Furthermore, this War God had once shocked the Immortal World!

Murong Qi frowned and asked, “Why are you here?”

“Hmph, I’ve already joined the Hidden Sect!” the Black Hell Demon Lord said proudly.

When Murong Qi was strong, even the Black Hell Demon Lord had to look up to him.

After so many years, Murong Qi had reincarnated and re-cultivated, while he was already a Demon Lord of the Demon Court.

No, the Demon Court Demon Lord’s identity was already discarded.

Su Qi was stunned.

An Immortal Emperor had entered the Hidden Sect?

Murong Qi asked, “The White-Robed Buddha also joined the Hidden Sect?”

The Black Hell Demon Lord snorted and said, “Probably.”

He felt disdain towards the White-Robed Buddha.

Murong Qi and Su Qi were shocked.

How many years had it been? The Hidden Sect already had two Immortal Emperors?

Wait!

How strong was Han Jue? “Come in.”

Han Jue’s voice floated over from the Connate Cave Abode.

The two of them hurriedly walked into the cave abode.

After entering, they quickly knelt in front of Han Jue.

Dao Comprehension Sword looked at them curiously. Didn’t they ascend? Why were they back?

Also puzzled, Han Jue asked, “The calamity is already so large?”

Murong Qi sighed, “We were worried about the Hidden Sect. I didn’t expect it to not need our protection.”

Su Qi chuckled. “That’s not my case. I came back to seek protection.”
