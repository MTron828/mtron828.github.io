Chapter 318 Even the Heavenly Emperor Has to Give In to Me!

Liu Bei sized up Li Xuan’ao and sensed that he was very strong. He said warily, “I’m not. I’m just helping to guard it.”

If he couldn’t win, he would give in and avoid being beaten to death.

Li Xuan’ao asked, “Who is the owner? Call him over.”

Liu Bei asked, “What’s the matter?”

“I want to obtain the Sword Dao River. He can negotiate with me or not. I’ll snatch it directly, then.”

Li Xuan’ao spoke very casually, not caring about Liu Bei at all.

Liu Bei looked terrified and said nervously, “This isn’t good. My master is an Immortal God of the Heavenly Court. If you do this, you will offend the Heavenly Emperor!”

Li Xuan’ao said disdainfully, “Offend the Heavenly Emperor? Even the Heavenly Emperor has to give in to me!”

Liu Bei shook his head. “I don’t believe it. If the Heavenly Emperor allows it, I’ll agree on behalf of my master.”

“Really?”

Li Xuan’ao raised his hand, and a Heavenly Dao Token appeared in his hand.

Soon, the Heavenly Emperor’s voice came from the Heavenly Dao Token, “What is it?”

“I heard that the owner of the Sword Dao River is an Immortal God of the Heavenly Court. I want the Sword Dao River. Can you give it to me?” Li Xuan’ao asked with a confident expression.

He was invited into the Heavenly Court by the Heavenly Emperor, after all!

The Heavenly Emperor replied, “No, you can ask for something else.” Li Xuan’ao’s expression froze.

Liu Bei heaved a sigh of relief.

The distant Pan Xin couldn’t help but turn around. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Li Xuan’ao said in a low voice, “Didn’t you agree to provide all the resources we want?” “Everything else is fine, but not when it comes to that Immortal God.” “He’s stronger than us?” “Mm.”

Li Xuan’ao was silent.

Although he was arrogant, he wasn’t stupid.

No matter how strong he was, he wasn’t invincible in the Heavenly Court.

“Hahaha—”

Pan Xin suddenly couldn’t help but laugh wantonly.

Li Xuan’ao’s face instantly turned ashen.

Liu Bei became nervous, afraid that he would suddenly erupt.

Li Xuan’ao snorted coldly and finally chose to leave.

Pan Xin looked at Liu Bei and smiled. “I didn’t expect that kid to have such a background. How interesting!”

Liu Bei nodded slightly but did not reply.

Pan Xin felt that it was boring and couldn’t be bothered to say anymore. He turned around and continued doing his own thing.

Liu Bei continued cultivating.

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

Han Jue learned everything from Liu Bei. He was even more displeased with Li Xuan’ao.

After gouging out the Chaotic Heavenly Dog’s eyes, he still wanted to snatch his territory?

He’s asking to get killed!

I’ll definitely deal with you in the future!

Han Jue thought silently. He couldn’t curse Li Xuan’ao immediately. It’d be too obvious.

Ten years later.

Dao Comprehension Sword sensibly stood up and left. Han Jue didn’t even need to say anything

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Li Xuan’ao.

Seven days later, he stopped cursing.

He had lost 500 million years of his lifespan!

He checked his emails as he recuperated.

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen killed a Son of Heaven and Earth. His providence has increased greatly.]

(Your good friend Huang Jihao was attacked by Jie School cultivators] x10769

[Because of your curse, your enemy Li Xuan’ao is ravaged by mental demons. His Sword Heart has turned evil.)

(Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by a Divine Palace mighty figure) x18

(Your disciple Long Hao has comprehended the Great Dao and learned a Mystical Power. He has gained enlightenment from the Heavenly Dao’s providence.]

[Your good friend Huang Zuntian has comprehended a Mystical Power. His cultivation has increased greatly.]

(Your good friend Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil has successfully possessed a body. He has transformed into a Buddha.]

Seeing that Li Xuan’ao was cursed, Han Jue was relieved.

He noticed that Ji Xianshen had actually killed a Son of Heaven and Earth. He was quite something.

However, being a Son of Heaven and Earth was not ridiculous. Perhaps it was one from the mortal world?

As expected of someone who had to face the calamity. Han Jue looked forward to how strong he would become in the calamity.

“I hope you can survive,” Han Jue thought.

He didn’t want all his friends to die after this calamity ended.

Han Jue continued cursing the Heavenly Dao Buddha and the Demon Emperor.

After cursing, he continued cultivating.

He wanted to become stronger before he went for the Dao preaching session!

Another twenty years passed.

The Heavenly Emperor finally contacted Han Jue and asked him to go to the void where the Reroll World was located. He would fetch him there.

Han Jue gathered all the disciples and told them about his trip.

“Wow, listening to the Dao outside the 33rd Heaven. Sect Master, this is a huge opportunity. I didn’t even have the chance to obtain such a qualification in the Demon Court,” the Black Hell Demon Lord said enviously.

re

Duan Hongchen also revealed a look of envy. Although he had slept for a period of time, in his era, those who could go to the 33rd Heaven were all mighty figures.

The other disciples were very curious about what was happening outside the 33 Heavens.

Han Jue said, “I’ll tell you when I’m back. I’m leaving.”

With that, he jumped out of the netherworld.

The disciples surrounded the Black Hell Demon Lord and listened to him talk about the legends outside the 33 Heavens.

Han Jue left the Heavenly Puppet in the Connate Cave Abode to prevent any accidents from happening on Hidden Sect Island.

After a long while…

Han Jue moved along and finally arrived at the void where the Reroll World was previously.

Not long after, the Heavenly Emperor appeared.

Two others were at his side. They were the Divine General and Long Jun. The Divine General was as powerful as Han Jue imagined

Long Jun was also very powerful. He was quite similar to Long Shan and Long Hao and was even more stable and imposing.

This was the first time the three of them had met. The Heavenly Emperor introduced them briefly before sweeping them away

They entered a mysterious and dazzling space. They were wrapped in the Heavenly Emperor’s Dharmic powers. Everything around them was rapidly retreating as if they were traveling through a spatial tunnel.

The Divine General stared at him and smiled. “I didn’t expect you to be willing to come out. I’ve heard too much about you.”

Long Jun was also very curious.

He was the Crown Prince of the Heavenly Court and could naturally obtain the trust of the Heavenly Emperor. He had also heard of Han Jue from him. Han Jue coughed and said, “I’m afraid of death, but I had to give the Heavenly Emperor face this time.”

The Heavenly Emperor snorted. “This kid actually rejected me. If I didn’t force him, you wouldn’t be able to see him now.”

Han Jue was embarrassed.

The Divine General and Long Jun were at a loss whether to laugh or cry. This fellow was really strange! Along the way, Han Jue did not say much. He was extremely nervous, afraid that a mighty figure would suddenly attack.

The Divine General, Long Jun, and the Heavenly Emperor chatted happily.

Han Jue was secretly anxious. This felt like he was on a bus and saw the other passengers chatting with the driver.

“What are you afraid of? You’re so tense!” The Heavenly Emperor glanced at him and snorted.

He felt that he was not trusted.

I’m bringing you there myself. Are you afraid of being attacked?

How strong am I in your mind?

Han Jue said, “It’s always good to be cautious. We can’t be too careful.”

Long Jun shook his head and laughed.

The Divine General nodded in approval.

The Heavenly Emperor didn’t say anything else.

About an hour later, they arrived and soared into the sky.

They passed through layers of clouds. Han Jue looked up. The sky seemed endless.

“How high is the sky in the Immortal World?”

Han Jue was curious.

Soon, he felt that he had passed through an invisible pressure layer. The sky suddenly rose and was no longer so blue.

Then, Han Jue felt pressure.

At that moment, he felt like he was advancing on the Sword Dao River. The more he advanced, the greater the pressure.

After passing through the eighteen layers of pressure, the sky became dark. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled. Han Jue vaguely saw thunder dragons churning in the sea of clouds. It was a spectacular view.
