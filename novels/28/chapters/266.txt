Chapter 267 Killing Intent of the Demon Emperor, Rage of a Hundred Million Years

Sword Pierces Heaven!

Sword Qi erupted!

Sword light burst out and drowned Golden Roc Demon Lord’s majestic body.

Almost instantly, Golden Roc Demon Lord raised his golden feathers to block.

Boom!

Golden Roc Demon Lord was directly slashed into two, causing blood to splatter through the void. His feathers were destroyed by the sword Qi as a rain of blood poured down across the Reroll World.

Just as the blood rain was about to fall, a mysterious force froze it in the air.

It was Han Jue.

He used his divine sense to expel all the blood.

If the blood of an Immortal Emperor fell on the mortal world, all living beings would die.

Taking this opportunity, Golden Roc Demon Lord’s essence soul jumped back and looked at him in horror.

Immortal Emperor! Playing the pig to eat the tiger! Golden Roc Demon Lord was furious. He quickly condensed into human form, and a golden-armored roc-headed demon appeared. He raised a trident with a terrifying aura.

Han Jue followed, and nine divine shadows appeared around him.

Great Traversal Divine Shadow!

Han Jue and the nine divine shadows used the move, Sword Pierces Heaven, again.

Terrifying sword Qi swept over, scaring Golden Roc Demon Lord as he teleported away.

The moment he reappeared, he saw Han Jue.

Han Jue waved his sword again.

This time, Golden Roc Demon Lord was killed before he could react.

His body and soul were destroyed!

Golden Roc Demon Lord was dead, but not completely.

(Golden Roc Demon Lord has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]

Han Jue showed a frown.

He could no longer sense Golden Roc Demon Lord’s aura.

Han Jue carefully observed his surroundings and used the system to check.

After confirming that the Golden Roc Demon Lord was no longer around, he returned to the Fusang Tree.

The battle lasted very quickly. It took less than half a minute from Han Jue’s departure to his return.

Everyone from the Hidden Sect looked at him and hesitated.

Han Jue checked his interpersonal relationships and discovered that the Golden Roc Demon Lord’s portrait was still there.

This fellow was still alive.

It seemed that this fellow had a soul fragment in his hometown, so he was not completely dead.

Han Jue’s first reaction was to curse him to death.

No.

After cursing so many people, someone might discover that he was the source of the curses.

Han Jue had to be cautious.

He would do it after some time!

Han Jue took a deep breath and said, “A strong enemy attacked the Reroll World just now. Fortunately, it has been resolved. I was almost killed by the other party. Cultivate well. I can’t protect you forever.”

Everyone looked at each other.

The Black Hell Chicken couldn’t help but ask, “Master, do you think we’re stupid?”

He was dealt with so quickly. It was obvious that he wasn’t almost killed, but Han Jue forcefully killed the other party. It had been more than two thousand years. Han Jue’s battle records were almost always insta-kills by crushing the enemy with overwhelming power!

Han Jue glared at the Black Hell Chicken, causing it to shrink in fear.

Long Hao asked excitedly, “Master, what’s his cultivation level?”.

Han Jue hesitated for a moment before saying, “Immortal Emperor.”

If the enemy was too weak, the disciples would definitely not feel any pressure.

Immortal Emperor!

Xun Chang’an, Li Yao, Ah Da, Xiao Er, and the Chaotic Heavenly Dog widened their eyes.

The others didn’t know how strong an Immortal Emperor was. They were only curious.

“That person isn’t dead. He might come back in the future. If I can’t win, I’ll run away,” Han Jue said seriously.

Everyone nodded, but they were still excited.

Run?

Since when have you ever run away?! Everyone from the Hidden Sect was thinking about the Immortal Emperor.

How strong was Han Jue?

Han Jue noticed their expressions and his heart skipped a beat.

Crap, I showed too much strength.

Han Jue said seriously, “Actually, I have something to tell you.”

Everyone waited expectantly. “The Immeasurable Calamity is about to arrive. Every time it descends, the myriad worlds will change. It’s like the end of the world. Most living beings will die…”

Han Jue but he didn’t exaggerate. The Immeasurable Calamity was that terrifying!

The chances of survival were slim!

Han Jue told them what he knew about the calamity, only talking about how those major forces had perished. Everyone was bitterly disappointed.

Such a terrifying calamity was about to arrive?

Zhou Mingyue carefully asked, “Grandmaster, will our mortal world also be affected?”

Han Jue nodded.

Everyone became even more nervous. They suddenly realized why a mighty figure like Han Jue would always hide in the mortal world.

So it was the calamity!

“Even if we stay away from conflict, we can’t avoid the calamity?” Li Yao asked.

She looked extremely nervous.

As a cultivator, she almost peed her pants.

Han Jue shook his head.

“Oh no, I’m not strong enough!”

“I finally understand why Grandmaster has been in seclusion. I really have to hurry up.”

“Even Grand Unity Golden Immortals will become cannon fodder. We’ll definitely die!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I won’t go out to train anymore!”

“Let’s see who can break through faster!”

Everyone’s emotions were ignited. Han Jue nodded in satisfaction.

(The Demon Emperor’s hatred towards you has increased. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]

A line of words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue, stunning him.

Demon Court, Demon Emperor Palace.

The Demon Emperor sat on the throne and stared at the kneeling Golden Roc Demon Lord expressionlessly.

“Immortal Emperor? I didn’t expect the Heavenly Court to still have an unknown Immortal Emperor hidden. No wonder Tianze died in the Reroll World,” the Demon Emperor muttered to himself.

Golden Roc Demon Lord gritted his teeth and said, “That fellow is shameless. He attacked without a word!”

The Demon Emperor did not reply. He only stared coldly at Golden Roc Demon Lord, scaring him so much that he hurriedly lowered his head.

“How can the Great Roc have such a useless son like you? You’re too careless. Since the other party can kill you quickly, it means that his strength far exceeds yours. Under such circumstances, he even used his full strength. You have to learn from him, or you’ll die sooner or later,” the Demon Emperor said indifferently. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

Golden Roc Demon Lord could also sense it. He thought that the Demon Emperor wanted to kill Han Jue.

Little did he know that the Demon Emperor also wanted to kill him!

The Demon Emperor sneered. “Very good. In that case, send a message to the Black Hell Demon Lord. Tell him to destroy the Reroll World and kill that kid!”

The Golden Roc Demon Lord suddenly raised his head and said excitedly, “Thank you, Your Majesty! With the Black Hell Demon Lord, that fellow is surely dead!”

The Demon Emperor waved his hand impatiently, and Golden Roc hurriedly retreated.

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

Han Jue frowned.

The increase in the Demon Emperor’s hatred was most likely caused by Golden Roc Demon Lord.

This was troublesome.

There would definitely be endless trouble.

Should he directly curse the Demon Emperor?

Wasn’t this too obvious?

On second thought, from the perspective of the Demon Emperor, he had too many enemies.

How could he think that it was him?

To be safe, Han Jue decided to wait.

He would cultivate for a few years before cursing.

Han Jue closed his eyes.

Seven years passed in a flash.

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and fell into a dilemma.

How should he curse this time?

Casually?

Or go all out?

Han Jue panicked when he thought of the Demon Emperor’s six-star hatred.

Go all in!

“Demon Emperor, right? I’ll spend 100 million years on you. Let’s see if you can withstand it!”

Han Jue made up his mind.

After breaking through to the Rank Two Immortal Emperor Realm, his lifespan surpassed seven trillion years.

So what if he used up 100 million years? Han Jue immediately cursed the Demon Court’s Demon Emperor with his full strength.
