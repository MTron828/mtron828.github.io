Chapter 933 Fusing the Supreme Rules

Han Jue’s voice echoed in the shattered Chaotic Void, shocking every living being.

Everyone was indescribably shocked as they looked at the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit who was still struggling in the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal. They even felt like they were dreaming.

Far away, the Sages in the Heavenly Dao Universal Hall looked at the scene in the crystal and their blood boiled.

This was their Divine Might Heavenly Sage!

!!

Forever invincible!

He would never lose!

Han Jue glanced at the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit behind him and narrowed his eyes.

The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal emitted a powerful pressure that scattered the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s body.

“Impossible! You want to defeat me just like that? Divine Might Heavenly Sage, you think too highly of yourself!” The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit shouted angrily. In an instant, his soul exploded and transformed into a divine light that vanished.

Han Jue seemed to sense something and glanced over. Among the million geniuses in the distance, a genius shone with divine light. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s aura appeared on his body and increased crazily.

No wonder this fellow had possessed so many geniuses. It was to escape!

After successfully possessing him, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit flew out from the million geniuses and looked down at him. “Your Mystical Power is impressive, but do you dare to destroy the million geniuses behind me?”

Vicious!

Wouldn’t Han Jue offend the entire Chaos if he did this?

That would cause endless trouble!

These million geniuses covered all the factions in the Chaos!

Han Jue smiled. “So this is what you ate relying on? How can you take revenge on the Heavenly Dao and unite the Chaos with these methods? If you control the Chaos, when experts challenge your status, you will use the living beings of the Chaos to threaten them. You will say that if they dare to act recklessly, you will kill the living beings of the Chaos and make them unable to be the controller of the Chaos?”

His words were filled with mockery, making the spectators want to laugh but not dare to. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

In the eyes of these two, the living beings of the Chaos were as if they could be destroyed with a wave of their hand. How could they not feel sorrow?

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit said coldly, “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, you’re so good with words. Defeat me with strength first!”

He raised his hands and the entire Ancient Desolate trembled violently as he absorbed the power of the entire place.

He suddenly waved his palm and his surging Dharmic powers gathered into dazzling light, causing the Chaotic Domain to lose its color.

The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal instantly appeared in front of Han Jue and absorbed the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s Dharmic powers.

In an instant, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit appeared behind Han Jue. A purple staff appeared in his right hand and struck at him.

The light of the purple staff was like flames. Just as it was about to hit Han Jue, the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal blocked it.

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was moved. He didn’t expect there to be more than one Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal.

The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal behind Han Jue was far smaller than the one in front of him, but it was extremely hard and easily blocked the purple staff.

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s eyes turned cold. The purple staff distorted the surrounding space. Countless illusions surrounded them, as if they had fallen into an endless illusion abyss. The various forms of life and the eighteen scenes of hell entered their eyes. The two of them kept hanging upside down. “Child’s play!”

Han Jue snorted disdainfully. The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal behind him emitted a terrifying suction force and directly absorbed the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, instantly destroying it.

The surrounding endless illusion shattered. Han Jue glanced over and saw that another prodigy had obtained the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s aura.

There was no end to it!

Han Jue immediately rushed over.

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit leaped and struck out with both palms. Each palm was a different Mystical Power. Countless afterimages appeared behind him as he waved his palms. The Mystical Powers also had different changes and were endlessly profound.

The spectators kept retreating, even Han Huang “This is the Great Dao Supreme Realm? No! It surpasses the Great Dao Supreme Realm!”

Han Huang looked up at the high and mighty Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit with clenched fists.

He would be so strong one day!

Wait, no!

He wanted to be stronger!

The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal blocked all the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s Mystical Powers. Han Jue was still advancing. With every step he took, the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal crushed forward with unstoppable force.

A black shadow suddenly condensed behind him.

Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols!

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit frowned and was vigilant, but his Mystical Power did not stop.

A vast pressure had already spread throughout the Chaos. Gaze after gaze crossed the distance and landed on the battlefield.

Han Jue even felt the Ultimate God of Punishment’s gaze, but he didn’t care.

The Ultimate God of Punishment would be defeated even if he came!

The black shadow behind Han Jue suddenly disappeared.

In the next second, he appeared among the million geniuses and kept sucking them away. Those geniuses were all Heavenly Dao lifeforms, including Dao Sovereign and the others.

In the blink of an eye, the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols had already snatched away all the Heavenly Dao geniuses at an extremely fast speed.

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit raised his right hand again. Purple light burst out from his palm. Endless Chaotic Heavenly Thunder interwove, causing the sky to look shattered.

Figures flew out from the Chaotic Heavenly Thunder, causing the spectators to be moved.

Divine Authority Generals!

Countless Divine Authority Generals swooped down at Han Jue.

His black hair fluttered and his red eyes were cold.

The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal in front of him emitted a dazzling light and directly sucked the Divine Authority Generals into it.

Han Jue raised his left hand and slapped out with the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm. It was invisible and directly shattered the Ancient Desolate’s two halves.

All of this happened too quickly. The Ancient Desolate was shattered the moment the Divine Authority Generals appeared.

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s eyes widened in anger.

Although the Ancient Desolate could no longer affect him, it had nurtured him as if it was his body. How could he not be angry?

“Divine Might Heavenly Sage, you’re really courting death!”

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit suddenly leaped. The million geniuses followed him into the sky. They were like arrows piercing through layers of space, rushing towards the Seven Supreme Rules.

Han Jue stepped into the Ultimate Origin Passage and appeared above the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s head. The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal pressed down like a mountain and blocked the other party.

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was destroyed again and possessed another prodigy. The million geniuses dispersed and continued to rush towards the Seven Supreme Rules.

Han Jue showed a frown.

The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal sucked away a million geniuses who struggled in pain.

Even if Han Jue didn’t hurt their origin, they would still suffer unprecedented pain and torture.

“Hmph, you’re still a step too slow!”

A voice came from above, causing Han Jue to turn around.

Two figures appeared under the Seven Supreme Rules. One was the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, and the other was the Ultimate God of Punishment.

The two supreme existences raised their right arms and pressed a Supreme Rule in their palms.

Han Jue looked at the Ultimate God of Punishment with a cold gaze.

The Ultimate God of Punishment did not dare to look at him and sighed slightly.

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit looked down at him and said, “You’re indeed powerful. I’m not your match, but what if the Supreme Rules are added?”

He directly entered a Supreme Rule.

The Ultimate God of Punishment poured all his Dharmic powers into this rule. His body turned ethereal, as if it would disappear at any moment.

The Seven Supreme Rules shook violently and silently, but they looked extremely violent. Even Han Jue felt a little uneasy.

What was he doing?

Han Jue focused and didn’t dare to act recklessly.

Would he provoke the Dao Creator if he attacked the Supreme Rules?

Forget it!

In any case, there was a trace of will in the Daoist temple. He could revive even if he died!

Han Jue and the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit attacked with the Supreme Rules. In that case, the Dao Creator could only blame the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit and not him!
