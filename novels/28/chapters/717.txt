Chapter 720 Life’s Identity

Eh?

Was there something wrong with this fellow?

Han Jue saw the hatred notification and remained calm. He nodded slightly at Xu Dudao and sat beside Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.

The other Sages were all seated.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Recently, a mysterious mighty figure named Life has appeared in the Chaos. He has already become powerful and said that he wants to flatten the Heavenly Dao in a hundred thousand years. We have to be on guard.”

The Sages were in an uproar.

“Trample the Heavenly Dao? Who is he? He’s so arrogant!”

“What a joke. Even the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End can’t do it. What right does he have to speak arrogantly?”.

“Where is this person from?”

“Life?”

“The Heavenly Dao is no longer the same as before. If he dares to come, we can give him a surprise!”

Although the Sages were shocked, they did not panic.

The Heavenly Dao was special. Even existences above the Sages could not barge in. If they wanted to attack the Heavenly Dao, they could only send living beings below the Sage Realm into the Heavenly Dao and destroy the providence of the Heavenly Dao, causing it to collapse. Only then could mighty figures step in.

Han Jue didn’t participate in the discussion and only listened quietly.

Although he was not staring at Xu Dudao, he was observing this guy.

It was really strange for Xu Dudao to develop 2-star hatred towards him for no reason.

Han Jue first thought of Life.

Could this fellow be related to Life?

Otherwise, how could it be so coincidental?

Han Jue used the simulation trial to test but didn’t see any words related to Life in the introduction.

“I want to know if Xu Dudao is related to the outside world beyond the Heavenly Dao?” Han Jue asked.

(3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

(Yes]

I knew it!

Han Jue continued to deduce.

“Who is Xu Dudao in contact with?”

(Unable to deduce. There is no such karma.]

Han Jue was amused.

Life hid his karma, but it couldn’t hide the fact that he was in contact with Xu Dudao.

It was just like how Han Jue asked if Divine Lord Peacock was injured by the mighty figure who saved the Curse Fiendcelestial. He could definitely get the outcome, but he couldn’t ask about Life’s true identity.

Oh my, Life, you’re really careless.

If Han Jue didn’t have the system and couldn’t discover the Sage’s impression of him, he might really have succeeded. Han Jue sneered in his heart, but he didn’t immediately stand up to point out Xu Dudao.

He was thinking about how to make use of this fellow’s identity.

He had to understand how strong Life was.

Then, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du began to arrange defenses.

Apart from Han Jue, all the Sages were arranged

Xu Dudao suddenly asked, “What about Senior Han? If the Heavenly Dao doesn’t have Senior Han’s protection, I’m not confident.’

He revealed a worried expression as if he was really worried about the Heavenly Dao. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Heavenly Venerate Wufa glanced at him and said, “This is confidential.”

The other Sages also revealed thoughtful expressions.

Xu Dudao was still too inexperienced to play tricks in front of them.

Pan Xin was no longer the boorish man from before. He could also tell what Xu Dudao was thinking. He couldn’t help but look embarrassed. He glared at him and berated him. “How can you, a new Sage, dictate what Fellow Daoist Han does?”

Xu Dudao said fearfully, “I’m not pointing fingers. It’s just that I’ve heard of the legend of the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage. Not only me, but in the hearts of all living beings, Senior Han is also the greatest protection of the Heavenly Dao.”

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Alright, don’t be suspicious of each other in times of danger.”

The Sages nodded.

Han Jue didn’t speak. He smiled and looked extremely easygoing.

Xu Dudao did not dare to speak anymore. He was secretly shocked.

“Why are the Sages protecting him? Is it fear? But in the Heavenly Dao, Sages are undying. There’s no need to rush to please him…”

Xu Dudao couldn’t figure it out.

He suddenly felt that the Sage circle was not as complicated as he thought.

easo

The reason why the Heavenly Dao could develop quickly was that the Sages were united!

Why were they united?

All because they listened to Han Jue?

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked Pan Xin to report the situation of the Chaotic Heavenly Road.

“The Chaotic Heavenly Road has been completely perfected. Even the Great Dao Sages can’t destroy it. More than a billion living beings come and go every day. It even attracted other living beings from the Little Heavenly Dao, the myriad worlds, and the dimensional space to join the Heavenly Dao…”

Pan Xin explained non-stop, the smugness on his face growing

The Chaotic Heavenly Road was definitely supported by him. Now that it had begun to increase the providence of the Heavenly Dao, he naturally had the greatest merit!

After he finished speaking, Shi Dudao said, “I’ll also head to the Chaotic Heavenly Road. I can spar with the experts of the Chaotic World. It’s said that many Sages in the Chaotic World use their strength to attain the Dao or those who kill three corpses to attain the Dao.”

Li Daokong said, “Then, I’ll go too!”

Shi Dudao rolled his eyes and cursed. “How long are you going to pester me? You’re not my match!”

Li Daokong chuckled and did not reply. The Sages were already used to it, and Han Jue didn’t interfere. If he spoke, he would either use his power to suppress others or let Li Daokong suffer. No matter what, it was inappropriate.

Moreover, the battle between the two was already benign. Actually, Shi Dudao also enjoyed fighting. If not for Li Daokong, how could he keep improving?

An hour later, the Sages left.

Han Jue suddenly smiled at Xu Dudao and said, “I see that you’re quite concerned about the Heavenly Dao. Come to my Dao Field. I’ll preach the Dao for you and increase your strength. You can also serve the Heavenly Dao in the future.”

Hearing this, Xu Dudao was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly agreed.

The other Sages had different reactions. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had the strangest expression.

Han Jue waved his sleeve and brought Xu Dudao to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.

After entering the Daoist temple, Xu Dudao was about to speak when Han Jue directly suppressed him and imprisoned his consciousness.

Time passed.

A thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.

[Primordial Heavenly Prison has successfully enslaved the target.]

(Xu Dudao has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.)

Xu Dudao opened his eyes and bowed respectfully to him.

Han Jue asked, “Who contacted you in the Chaos?”

Xu Dudao replied, “Life, a mysterious existence. I don’t know his true identity, either. He promised me that after destroying the Heavenly Dao, he would let me be the Heavenly Dao’s master.”

Han Jue showed a frown.

Did Xu Dudao not know Life’s identity?

“You know nothing about him. How can you trust him?” Han Jue asked in confusion.

Xu Dudao replied, “I’ve once stepped onto the Chaotic Heavenly Road and roamed the Chaos. I’ve seen his strength. He’s indeed terrifying. I witnessed him subdue a Chaotic Fiendcelestial…”

He looked terrified.

Han Jue’s eyes lit up.

He asked for more details, and Xu Dudao said everything he knew.

In the end, Han Jue let him stay the same and pretend that he did not submit to him.

He sent Xu Dudao to the 33rd Heaven and used the derivation function.

“I want to see the battle described by Xu Dudao!”

Han Jue directly avoided Life and deduced from the perspective of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial and Xu Dudao.

(200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

Han Jue’s consciousness fell into the illusion.

He opened his eyes and saw that he was standing beside Xu Dudao.

Xu Dudao trembled like a candle in the storm, about to be extinguished at any moment.

Han Jue looked up. Flames flickered in the depths of the darkness. Space shattered and formed shattered crystals that floated in the void. Lightning of all colors interwove. It was endless.

Two figures were fighting in the depths of the lightning
