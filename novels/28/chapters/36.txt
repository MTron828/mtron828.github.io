Chapter 37: Fourth Level of the Nascent Soul Realm, Imitate Heaven and Earth

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Han Jue received the crimson feather and perused it with his divine sense.

Immediately after, he felt a powerful force obstructing his divine sense.

Maybe only the divine sense of a Soul Formation realm cultivator could force into the object.

Yang Tiandong had a 3-star favorability toward him. So what he said was probably true.

“Then, I’ll accept it first. You can cultivate your spirit energy for ten years first. I like those who cultivate diligently. If you perform well, I’ll teach you spells,” Han Jue said.

Yang Tiandong quickly thanked him.

Han Jue pointed to the side and said, “Find a place to meditate and cultivate.”

Then, he closed his eyes and began to cultivate.

Yang Tiandong stood up and found a corner to sit down.

He didn’t dare to look at Han Jue for fear of offending him, so he immediately started cultivating.

Soon, he discovered that the Spirit Qi in this cave abode was extremely dense.

It was a good place for cultivation!

...

Ever since the Spirit Qi Gathering array formation and the new natural treasures were added to the cave abode, the Spirit Qi there became increasingly dense. Han Jue’s cultivation was more and more efficient.

In the blink of an eye, ten years had passed.

At the same time, Han Jue reached the fourth level of the Nascent Soul realm.

This sort of breakthrough speed definitely surpassed mortals.

According to this cultivation speed, breaking through to Soul Formation wasn’t too far away.

Han Jue opened his eyes.

In these ten years, Yang Tiandong’s cultivation had reached the sixth level of the Foundation Establishment realm.

Six levels in ten years.

He was pretty fast.

He was indeed a genius!

Han Jue called him, “Tiandong.”

Yang Tiandong suddenly woke up and hurriedly kowtowed to him.

“How have you felt these ten years?” Han Jue asked.

Yang Tiandong replied, “I’ve benefited greatly. Not only did my cultivation level increase, but I’ve also made sense of many principles.”

My goodness!

It’s been ten years!

Yang Tiandong wailed in his head.

In these ten years, he had become hopeless countless times.

However, he felt that this was Han Jue’s test for him, and he could not relax.

If he couldn’t even pass the first stage, Han Jue would definitely not treat him as his disciple.

Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

He made sense of many principles?

Bullsh*t!

I’ve been in seclusion for more than a hundred years, but I haven’t made sense of anything.

Han Jue felt that there was a need for Yang Tiandong to gain more experience. He said, “Go out and do some missions. I remember that the sect mission building has a monthly contribution list. You can come back when you become the first on the list.”

Yang Tiandong immediately stood up.

When he got up, he nearly went down again.

After sitting for ten years, his lower body had stiffened.

He quickly bowed and left.

Han Jue waved his hand and opened the door.

After Yang Tiandong left, Han Jue pondered for a moment before taking out the Divine Cognition Pills he obtained from killing Duan Tongtian.

The pills were used to enhance divine sense. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After strengthening his divine sense, he could try to break into the crimson feather that Yang Tiandong had given him.

There were nine pills in the bottle. Han Jue took out one immediately.

After taking the Divine Cognition Pill, Han Jue immediately felt dizzy.

Some time passed.

When he woke up, he discovered that his divine sense had doubled in strength.

He was pleasantly surprised.

This pill is quite powerful!

Han Jue began taking the pill regularly.

Half a month later.

All nine Divine Cognition Pills were consumed. The effects were outstanding. His divine sense soared.

It was more than ten times stronger!

The more pills one consumed, the stronger the effect. It was very magical.

Han Jue took out the crimson feather again and probed it with his divine sense.

Boom—

That powerful resistance appeared again!

Han Jue gritted his teeth and persisted.

His divine sense collided with the barrier.

After about three seconds, he forcefully broke through the resistance.

Immediately after, an enormous amount of memories surged into Han Jue’s mind.

Mystical Power!

Imitate Heaven and Earth!

This was a mystical power that allowed one’s body to grow ten thousand times.

This mystical power had appeared in many legends. When mastered, one could have a ten-thousand-meter tall body!

Han Jue was pleasantly surprised. He liked the grandness and magnificence of the mystical power.

...

In the mountains, a group of cultivators was hurrying on their way.

The one walking in front was Mo Fuchou.

Mo Fuchou had reached the Golden Core realm and had become a true core disciple.

Other than him and two other male disciples, the rest were all young men and women.

“Is Jade Pure Sect up ahead?”

“Haiz, will I fail the selection test!?”

“It’s normal to fail. Treat me well in the future and I’ll let you play the flute. With your whistling skills, you should be able to play the flute well.”

“Which of the eighteen peaks is the strongest?”

“I’m not sure. Senior Mo will introduce each peak to us when the time comes.”

These youths were the new disciples of the Jade Pure Sect. Mo Fuchou had recently accepted a mission to be in charge of recruiting disciples.

Old Immortal Daoist Thunder wanted to support him. Being a core disciple wasn’t enough, Mo Fuchou needed to build his authority.

Recruiting disciples was the easiest way to form connections and build authority.

Hearing the discussion behind him, Mo Fuchou smiled.

Back in the days, he had also been very excited when he joined the sect.

At this moment!

An air-piercing sound came from the front. Mo Fuchou subconsciously drew his sword and slashed the air with it, shattering a bamboo arrow. Immediately after, the bamboo arrow fragments turned into a poisonous mist that spread in all directions.

“Retreat, we ran into enemies!” Mo Fuchou said in a deep voice, then jumped up and swung his sword at the attacker.

It was a man in a straw raincoat, and his straw hat concealed his face. He pulled out two curved blades from his back, and the blades were shiny and cold.

Seeing that Mo Fuchou was charging towards him, the person in the raincoat moved and formed five clones. All of them attacked Mo Fuchou.

Mo Fuchou slashed out with his sword. Lightning flickered, turning into a large net that covered the raincoat man and his clones.

The raincoat man quickly spun, turning into a black whirlwind, forcefully tearing apart the lightning web.

Mo Fuchou did not panic. He performed a hand seal with his left hand and struck the ground. Lightning traveled along the ground at an extremely fast speed.

The raincoat man had just landed on the ground when the lightning wrapped around him, causing his entire body to start trembling.

Mo Fuchou charged forward, preparing to subdue the attacker.

Boom—

The ground beside him suddenly exploded, and another man in a raincoat broke out from the ground, swinging his blade at him.

Mo Qiangsun cursed in his head. Who are these guys?

How dare they cause trouble in the Jade Pure Sect’s vicinity!

Just as he was about to react, a talisman emerged from the ground behind him and quickly stuck onto his back.

Mo Fuchou was immediately petrified and rooted in position.

Pu!

The man in the raincoat stabbed through Mo Fuchou’s chest, and blood splashed out along the blade.

Mo Fuchou’s pupils dilated with despair.

Crap!

The others stepped back. When they saw that Mo Fuchou had been severely injured, all of them panicked!

“Everyone, kneel. We only want to capture Mo Fuchou. If you dare to disrupt us, you will all die!” one of the men shouted in a deep voice. The disciples were so scared that their legs were like jelly. They instinctively knelt.

The youths had never seen such a scene. All of their faces were ghastly pale while their entire bodies trembled, and they didn’t dare speak.

Mo Fuchou couldn’t move. He stared at the man in front of him and asked in a low voice, “Who exactly are you?”

“Heavenly Constellation Earthly Wraith. We’re the phantoms in raincoats. Jade Pure Sect has committed a grave mistake. We’re here to capture you. All I can tell you is that a great calamity awaits your sect!”

The man in the raincoat spoke in a low and hoarse voice.

Mo Fuchou’s eyes widened in disbelief.

At this moment...

Boom!

A giant had unknowingly appeared among the mountains. His upper body was concealed by the blanket of clouds, and the highest peaks around him only reached his waist. The scene was spectacular.

In front of this giant, everyone felt tiny, as if they were ants looking at a human.

The two raincoat men were so frightened that their hands trembled.

Because the giant wore the Jade Pure Sect’s Daoist robe!
