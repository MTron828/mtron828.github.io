Chapter 270 Hidden Sect Island, Crazy Demon Court

Immortal Emperor Samsara?

Did he recognize the wrong person?

Han Jue looked at the man in the raincoat and fell into deep thought.

“It’s been a million years. You’re finally here. Where’s the thing I wanted?” the man in the raincoat asked with his back facing him.

Han Jue asked calmly, “What about the thing I want?”

The man in the raincoat pulled the fishing rod in his hand and the line shrank. He put the fishing rod into his sleeve and turned to look at him, “I’ve already gotten what you wanted, but what about what I want?”

How cautious!

Han Jue said, “This involves too many things. The calamity is coming. I have to understand what you want to do.”

The man in the raincoat was silent and looked up at him. Under his rain hat, a pair of ghost-like eyes flickered non-stop. It was strange and terrifying.

Han Jue was very calm.

Although he couldn’t see through the other party’s cultivation, he didn’t feel that it was very dangerous.

The man in the raincoat said, “I’ve already said that it’s only for revenge.”

Against who?

Han Jue was puzzled, but he didn’t ask. What if the raincoat man and Immortal Emperor Samsara had already talked about it?

“Immortal Emperor Samsara, could it be that you want to go back on your word? Have you given up on your grand plan?” the raincoat man continued. When Han Jue heard the words “grand plan”, he felt that he couldn’t interfere anymore.

He wanted to take advantage of the situation, but he realized that something was wrong.

Forget it. He was here to find a place to hide and not cause trouble.

“Wait a little longer. I’ll come find you soon.” With that, Han Jue turned around and left.

“Wait! Immortal Emperor Samsara! I’m not threatening you!”

The man in the raincoat panicked and hurriedly caught up to him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Han Jue increased his speed and quickly shook him off.

The man in the raincoat stopped and stomped his feet before returning helplessly.

Han Jue continued forward and started to think.

What was Immortal Emperor Samsara’s plan? Han Jue had met Immortal Emperor Samsara before, but they had only chatted for a while. He didn’t even see his true appearance.

“Is there a trap in the inheritance given to me by the system?”

Han Jue thought silently. This Immortal Emperor Samsara clearly had a powerful background.

However, Han Jue was not worried. He had already surpassed the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique and created an even stronger Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao.

He only needed to become stronger. No matter what schemes Immortal Emperor Samsara had prepared, he was not afraid. After circling around for several hours, Han Jue still didn’t find a suitable place.

In the blink of an eye.

Another five years passed. Han Jue kept wandering in the netherworld. After searching for a period of time, he would return to the Connate Cave Abode to avoid being attacked.

During his time in the netherworld, he encountered Devils, Bodhisattvas, Demon Saints, and even saw the underworld.

The netherworld was complicated, and the number of forces exceeded Han Jue’s expectations.

He kept his distance, afraid that others would discover his existence.

Finally.

Han Jue discovered a very well hidden valley located in the Yellow Spring’s ocean. It was an island overall. From high up in the sky, it was only the tip of a reef the size of a fist that revealed the surface of the sea. After landing, he discovered a hidden space. It was very big inside.

Most importantly, this island wouldn’t be flooded by the water of the netherworld. It would undulate along the surface of the sea, but one would not feel any fluctuations on the island.

The interior of the island was hundreds of kilometers wide. There were no flowers or trees, and the valley that Han Jue had his eyes on was located at the center of the island. This valley actually contained a Connate restriction. Entering the valley would result in the Five Elements Calamity of wind, rain, lightning, thunder, and fire. If living beings below the Grand Unity Mystic Immortal Realm forced their way in, their bodies and souls would definitely be destroyed.

Nice place!

It wasn’t easy to discover this island from the outside. There were also Connate restrictions on the island, equivalent to defensive arrays and trap arrays.

Han Jue was very satisfied. Then, he started to cast spells to deepen the spatial restrictions outside the island so that the divine sense of living beings below him couldn’t capture it.

Then, he erected a huge monument.

Hidden Sect! If a mighty figure discovered this place, they would also understand that it was already occupied.

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. He finally found a place to hide.

He left after leaving a Six Paths Insignia on the island.

After returning to the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue began to create a Heavenly Puppet.

He would send it to Hidden Sect Island to guard it.

As for why he didn’t create a Reincarnation Avatar, Han Jue felt that one Liu Bei was enough.

After all, the Reincarnation Avatar had the ability to think independently. Although it was absolutely loyal, something might happen. If the enemy caught it and read its soul, it would be terrible if it stole Han Jue’s secrets.

The fewer Reincarnation Avatars there were, the better!

Han Jue thought silently.

Ten days later, he finished creating the Heavenly Puppet and brought it to the netherworld through his essence soul.

On that day, his essence soul returned to his body. After doing all of this, Han Jue started cultivating again.

In the endless wasteland, countless demons and Heavenly Soldiers were fighting.

Two figures walked out from the end of the ground. They were the second disciple of the Human School, Li Xuan’ao, and Huang Jihao, who had lost to Han Jue in the mortal world.

Huang Jihao looked at the battle in the sky and was extremely nervous. He asked carefully, “Senior, why are we here?”

The battle between the Heavenly Court and the Demon Court had long spread throughout the Immortal World. Huang Jihao also knew that he had to look up to these two overlords. He didn’t want to take any risks.

Although he liked to fight, he was not stupid. Li Xuan’ao said expressionlessly, “Don’t you want to learn my Sword Dao?” “Is it related to this battlefield?”

“My Sword Dao is the Killing Dao.”

Huang Jihao’s eyes widened in shock.

Senior, are you joining the battle?

He asked nervously, “Which side are you supporting?”

Li Xuan’ao’s eyes were cold. “Slaughter the immortals and gods!”

Huang Jihao felt even more terrified when he heard that.

In his heart, the demons were the humans’ enemies. The immortals were the forces that protected the humans, so they naturally favored the Heavenly Court. “Go kill the enemies. Kill a hundred thousand Heavenly Soldiers and I’ll teach you the Sword Dao,” Li Xuan’ao said softly.

Hearing this, Huang Jihao’s expression changed.

Li Xuan’ao was the strongest sword immortal he had ever seen. He had shamelessly obtained his approval after much effort.

If he rejected now, all his efforts would be in vain.

Fine, then!

Huang Jihao gritted his teeth and drew his sword.

In this life, he was cultivating for himself!

How could he let emotions stop him!

On the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.

Less than a year after Han Jue returned from the netherworld, Di Taibai took the initiative to contact him.

“What is it?” Han Jue asked.

Di Taibai said, “The Demon Court has gathered many powerful ancient races in the Immortal World, including the Roc Race, the Golden Crow Race, the Vermilion Bird Race, and so on. Next, they will launch a full-scale counterattack against the Heavenly Court and the Buddhist Sect. The Heavenly Court will no longer be able to care about the mortal world. It’s best that you ascend. That way, the Heavenly Court can still protect you.”

[Detected that the Demon Court has launched a full-scale counterattack against the Heavenly Court. You have the following choices:)

(1: Immediately ascend and join the Heavenly Court. You can obtain a random natural treasure.)

[2: Don’t ascend for the time being. Cultivate in a low profile manner and you can obtain a Supreme Treasure.] Han Jue showed a frown.

If he went to Heavenly Court now, wouldn’t he be surrounded? If Heavenly Court lost, wouldn’t he be trapped?

He couldn’t go! Han Jue said seriously, “I can’t leave the Reroll World. I’m the guardian of this mortal world, after all. The Heavenly Court doesn’t have to worry about me. I can take care of myself.”

Di Taibai sighed. “Damned Demon Court. I didn’t expect them to secretly collude with so many ancient races. It’s obvious that they’ve been planning this for a long time. The Demon Emperor has already gone mad. He wants to destroy the Heavenly Court and the Buddhist Sect even if he has to trigger the calamity.”
