Chapter 126: Eighth Level of Tribulation Transcendence Realm, Three Suns

Han Jue folded his sleeves and said casually, “You… lost.”

Please don’t develop any hatred points!

If it appears, you’ll die!

Ji Xianshen stood still as if struck by lightning. He didn’t wipe away the blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.

His expression fluctuated. It was obvious that he was extremely unsettled.

Ji Xianshen gritted his teeth and asked, “Are you a Mahayana cultivator?”

He had even killed a fiendish expert at the fourth level of the Mahayana Realm. How could he lose to this person?

Could this person be at the ninth level of the Mahayana Realm?

Han Jue hesitated for a moment and then nodded slowly.

Seeing this, Ji Xianshen felt slightly better, but he still couldn’t accept it. He said with a pained expression, “How can I lose to a Mahayana Realm cultivator… How…”

Han Jue wanted to say, You’re too arrogant!

You’re at the ninth level of the Tribulation Transcendence Realm. Why can’t you lose to a Mahayana Realm cultivator?

Of course, I’m not in the Mahayana Realm either!

Ji Xianshen took a deep breath and stared at him. “Guan Yu, you are the first to defeat me, but I will win next time. I’m destined to be invincible! I was born to be an Immortal God!”

Han Jue nodded and said, “I believe you. Your talent is indeed unparalleled. The future belongs to you.”

Ji Xianshen’s complexion improved.

[Ji Xianshen has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 2 stars]

Ji Xianshen left after saying: “I will prove you right!”

In the blink of an eye, he vanished into the horizon.

Han Jue returned to the cave abode and ignored everyone in the sect.

Dao Comprehension Sword quickly ran back into the cave abode and asked curiously, “Was that person very strong?”

Han Jue replied, “Very strong, comparable to a Mahayana Realm cultivator.”

Dao Comprehension Sword was frightened.

So powerful?

She knew that Mahayana was the highest realm in the world.

In other words…

Her master was already a Mahayana Realm cultivator?

Han Jue shook his head and smiled. “I’m still far from the Mahayana Realm.”

“Then why can you repel him?”

“Because I cultivate diligently, my accumulation is greater than his. Therefore, you have to be like me in the future. As long as you cultivate diligently and accumulate your foundation, you can defeat existences whose cultivation realm is higher than yours.”

Dao Comprehension Sword fell into deep thought.

Han Jue continued, “There are at least ten thousand Mahayana Realm cultivators in the world, not to mention the Tribulation Transcendence Realm and the Body Integration Realm. Although you have already transformed, you are still a natural treasure. If you’re discovered by a mighty figure, they will definitely eat you.”

Dao Comprehension Sword’s face turned pale after hearing that.

Han Jue closed his eyes and started cultivating.

Defeating Ji Xianshen did not make him feel anything special. It was better to break through to the eighth level of the Tribulation Realm as soon as possible. It would make him happier.

…

The matter of defeating Ji Xianshen did not cause a stir in the sect. After Daoist Nine Cauldrons learned of Ji Xianshen’s identity, he was nearly frightened to death. He immediately suppressed the matter, afraid that it would spread.

The Jade Pure Sacred Sect could not be compared to the Heavenly Immortal Manor. This battle record was a blade that hung above their necks!

Daoist Nine Cauldrons placed more importance on Han Jue now. Sometimes, he would even personally come to the immortal mountain to plant the natural treasures and chat with the Black Hell Chicken, Yang Tiandong, and Xun Chang’an to improve their relationship.

Murong Qi was highly regarded by him, and his status and power rose.

Most of the time, Murong Qi would return to the Fusang Tree to cultivate until he went out on a sect mission.

Han Jue focused on cultivation and prepared to reach the eighth level of the Tribulation Transcendence Realm in one go.

Thirteen years passed quickly.

Han Jue finally broke through to the eighth level of the Tribulation Transcendence Realm!

He was nearly six hundred years old now.

Han Jue checked the cultivation levels of Xing Hongxuan, Fairy Xi Xuan, Mo Zhu, and Chang Yue’er.

The lowest was at the fifth level of the Nascent Soul Realm. Fairy Xi Xuan was even leading ahead at the Soul Formation Realm, which was not bad.

The reason why they could improve so much was not only because of their opportunities but also because of the Spirit Qi on Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.

Han Jue also wanted them to become stronger.

He wasn’t a traditional novel protagonist, and neither was the system. He couldn’t take out Longevity Pills or Immortal Formation Pills.

Without another word, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing.

While cursing, he checked his emails.

[Your Divine Pet Chaotic Heavenly Dog was attacked by righteous cultivators] x53111

[Your good friend Huang Jihao was attacked by a fiendish cultivator] x58934

[Your good friend Daoist Calm Sky was attacked by a fiendish cultivator and died.]

[Your grand-disciple Fang Liang coincidentally met the place where the ancient mighty figures discussed the Dao. He comprehended the true meaning of Heaven and Earth and his cultivation increased greatly.]

…

Most of the content involved the demonic path!

The number of times Ji Xianshen had been attacked was simply too ridiculous.

He was definitely the one who had taken the initiative to go to the sect and suffered the counterattack of over 100,000 fiendish cultivators.

Han Jue noticed the death of Daoist Calm Sky. This was an elder of the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect. Back then, he had infiltrated the Jade Pure Sacred Sect and wanted to kill Han Jue. In the end, he was killed instead. After that, he didn’t dare to anymore and instead helped the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect surrender to the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.

His death might make Liu Bumie very sad.

This was the cultivation world. People died every day.

Han Jue clicked on his interpersonal relationships again. He felt that there were fewer icons. Fortunately, the people he cared about were still around.

“In the raging dust of the mortal realm, lives come and go like the sand on the shore. Fellow Daoists, I’ll walk your path for you.”

Han Jue thought silently. He raised his hands and cupped his fists.

“It’s rare for us to meet by chance in this world. I have to thank all of you for your appreciation and goodwill.”

Han Jue sighed in his heart.

Dao Comprehension Sword asked curiously, “Master, what are you doing?”

Han Jue replied, “Saying goodbye to those who have passed away.”

“Who’s dead?”

“Someone I’m not familiar with, and many people I don’t remember.”

“If you don’t know them well and don’t remember the details, why are you sending them off?”

“To warn myself that the path of cultivation is very dangerous. Remember, always be cautious and never lose your reverence.”

Dao Comprehension Sword felt deep veneration. Master’s cultivation realm was truly high!

Han Jue got up and walked out of the cave abode.

He frowned as he stepped out.

The Black Hell Chicken wasn’t on the tree. Instead, it was cultivating at the edge of the forest.

Han Jue walked behind Xun Chang’an and asked, “Has the Fusang Tree been moving recently?”

Xun Chang’an was frightened by his voice and subconsciously replied, “Yes!”

He turned around and saw that it was Han Jue. He hurriedly knelt down.

Yang Tiandong also woke up and knelt down to Han Jue.

The Black Hell Chicken opened its eyes and hurriedly flew towards Fusang Tree when it saw him.

Han Jue raised his hand and sucked it in. He grabbed the Black Hell Chicken’s neck and asked, “How long has it been?”

“A few years…”

“How many years?”

“It’s been five years…”

“Have you heard of chicken stew, braised chicken, roasted chicken, and chicken mushroom soup?”

“Ah… Master, I was wrong! I was wrong!” The Black Hell Chicken almost burst into tears as it shrieked.

It was most afraid of Han Jue.

Although Yang Tiandong and Xun Chang’an hated it, they tried to dissuade Han Jue when they heard his words. “Master, it doesn’t deserve death!”

Han Jue suddenly looked up.

The Black Hell Chicken was still begging for mercy. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Yang Tiandong and Xun Chang’an subconsciously looked up. Xun Chang’an had a strange expression and asked in a low voice, “Is there something wrong with my eyes? Why are there three suns in the sky?”
