Chapter 54: Heavenly Court’s Jinx, Unparalleled Talent

Hearing Xing Hongxuan’s words, Han Jue’s expression became even stranger. The reason was that his divine sense discovered a soul hidden in the jade pearl.

This soul was a fierce spirit filled with a malevolent aura.

It was obviously not a good thing!

Han Jue asked, “Where did you find this pearl?”

After he explained the situation of the ferocious spirit in the jade pearl, Xing Hongxuan’s eyes widened in disbelief.

After that, she frowned and said in a low voice, “I obtained it in a cultivation market. I participated in the auction and obtained a treasure. However, someone targeted me. He followed me and wanted to seize my treasure. In the end, he was killed by me and I received this item from his storage ring. The fellow Daoist who accompanied me told me that this is a Connate Spirit Gathering Jade, and it’s extremely rare. It’s a cultivation sacred treasure. I heard that it was so amazing, so I brought it over to you.”

Han Jue felt that something was amiss.

But he couldn’t figure it out.

He immediately used the Six Paths Soul Absorption Technique and eliminated the ferocious spirit inside. Then, he returned the Connate Spirit Gathering Jade to her.

“Take it. I’ve already gotten rid of the evil spirit inside. This treasure won’t be of much help to me. You, on the other hand, are about to break through to the Golden Core Realm. You just happen to need this treasure,” Han Jue said seriously.

Xing Hongxuan subconsciously wanted to reject him, but Han Jue continued, “Your cultivation is too slow. At this rate, the possibility of me becoming your husband will decrease. You should be thinking of increasing your cultivation speed.”

Xing Hongxuan’s smile turned bitter.

Han Jue couldn’t bear to watch this. After all, this was the woman who had the highest favorability towards him.

With a flip of his right hand, he handed Xing Hongxuan the spirit pills that he had seized in the past.

These pills could help her break through to the Golden Core Realm and help her increase her cultivation level.

“You were the one who gave me treasures in the past. I’ll do the same to you now. Also, open a Cave Abode in the back mountain and cultivate,” Han Jue said seriously.

Xing Hongxuan was pleasantly surprised and smiled sweetly.

When Han Jue saw this, he inexplicably panicked. He said seriously, “We are not husband and wife yet. I hope that you will do your best to cultivate. Also, don’t publicize our relationship. I have killed many powerful enemies for the Jade Pure Sect. Don’t become the enemy’s weakness to threaten me, understand?”

Xing Hongxuan nodded obediently.

Hmph.

Rascal.

You still care about me.

He said that he was afraid she would become his weakness, but he was actually worried about her safety.

The more Xing Hongxuan thought about it, the sweeter she felt.

She recalled that back then, Han Jue was still a youth in her eyes. Now, he had become the powerful Deity Slaying Elder of the Jade Pure Sect.

Such potential was unheard of in the cultivation world.

She had to work hard.

If this continued, she’d not be worthy of Han Jue.

Xing Hongxuan didn’t stay for long.

She wanted to seize this opportunity to get closer to Han Jue, but the Black Hell Chicken and the Chaotic Heavenly Dog kept staring at her. Their eyes widened, making her feel embarrassed.

...

A year and a half later.

The Spirit Qi in the mountain where Han Jue was at increased greatly. Besides the Spirit Gathering Array, Li Qingzi also set up a protective array.

Under Han Jue’s instructions, Xing Hongxuan quietly moved to the back of the mountain and enjoyed the boundless Spirit Qi there.

One fine day, the Jade Pure Sect’s Millennium Ceremony was about to begin. All the righteous sects of the cultivation world sent people to congratulate them. The Jade Pure Sect welcomed an unprecedentedly lively event.

It was said that the Sect Master of the Raincoat Sect vanished after heading to the Jade Pure Sect. In other words, it was very likely that he died there.

This greatly elevated the Jade Pure Sect’s status in the cultivation world. No one dared to slight them.

After Daoist Nine Cauldrons returned, he began to personally clean up the sect. The Spirit Qi in the eighteen peaks and the inner sect cities also increased greatly. Although it wasn’t as good as Han Jue’s mountain, it was several times stronger than before.

Not only that, but Daoist Nine Cauldrons also captured several great demons comparable to the Nascent Soul realm and imprisoned them in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm.

The Jade Pure Sect was growing day by day.

Han Jue wasn’t interested in the Millennium Ceremony, so he did not attend and continued cultivating.

What was worth mentioning was that as the Black Hell Chicken and Chaotic Heavenly Dog grew larger, the Cave Abode could no longer contain them. Han Jue chased them out half a year ago.

They had to make their own cave on the mountain. At the same time, they were strictly forbidden from leaving the mountain’s vicinity.

The Black Hell Chicken had been instilled with values by Han Jue from a young age. Now, it was already a very timid—no, a very cautious chicken. It often taught the Chaotic Heavenly Dog to have the same temperament as it.

However, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog was naturally arrogant and despised it.

Although the Chaotic Heavenly Dog did not respect it, the Black Hell Chicken still relied on its strength to forcefully control it.

No matter what, this dog was hatched by it.

In Han Jue’s words, this was its son.

One fine day, a line of words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue.

[Detected bearer of Connate providence, checking its origin.]

Another bearer of Connate providence?

Han Jue already had an understanding of Connate providence. These were people with extraordinary fates.

Some were jinxes, while some were children of destiny.

A person with Connate providence was not absolutely powerful.

Han Jue immediately chose to check the person’s background.

[Su Qi: The reincarnation of the jinx of the Heavenly Court. He was born with bad luck and would bring calamity to the people around him. He had an extremely overpowering destiny, and the people around him were often forced to death by bad luck, while he would always be able to turn the situation around for himself. When he heard that the Jade Pure Sect was the strongest sect in the cultivation world, he wanted to join it and learn an orthodox cultivation method. Special hint: Because you have the providence of the descendant of an Immortal Emperor, you are not affected by the jinx’s bad luck. In addition, you are not allowed to kill the jinx. Otherwise, even your providence as the descendant of an Immortal Emperor cannot stop the overwhelming bad luck.]

What the heck?

Reincarnation of a jinx?

Han Jue was speechless.

Although his providence as a descendant of the Immortal Emperor could avoid the influence of the jinx, the Jade Pure Sect could not!

Han Jue hurriedly scanned with his divine sense.

Su Qi was walking towards the mountain.

This was not good!

Han Jue hesitated for a moment before deciding to meet this jinx.

...

At the foot of the mountain, a youth sat on a large rock, panting and wiping the sweat from his forehead.

Although he wasn’t handsome, his eyes were filled with spirit.

He turned to look at the eighteen peaks with blazing eyes.

“Why are you, a mortal, here?” Han Jue’s voice suddenly floated over.

He appeared in front of Su Qi.

Su Qi shivered in fear and hurriedly knelt in front of Han Jue.

Suppressing his excitement, he said, “My name is Su Qi. I want to cultivate. I know the rules of cultivation sects, but I want to skip the outer sect and directly bring my talent into the inner sect of the Jade Pure Sect!”

How arrogant!

Han Jue was speechless.

Also, why did that sound so familiar?

Han Jue shook his head and said, “You’re old enough. You missed the best cultivation time.”

For the sake of peace and stability in the future, Han Jue could only chase him away.

“Impossible, my talent is unparalleled!”

“How about this, I’ll teach you the Qi Gathering Technique. You can find another place to cultivate and not join the Jade Pure Sect.”

“No, I have to join this sect. Are you not a member of the Jade Pure Sect? I heard that the sect is holding a Millennium Ceremony and is inviting all sects in the cultivation world.”

Su Qi looked at him warily.

Han Jue was puzzled. How did this mortal know so many things?

“Are you really not leaving?”

“No!”

“Alright!”

Han Jue grabbed Su Qi and brought him back to the Connate Cave Abode.

Su Qi was thrown to the ground on his butt, hurting it.

Han Jue sat on the bed again and said, “From today onwards, you can only stay here. You can forget about going out for the rest of your life!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Since he was immune to Su Qi’s bad luck, he was not afraid.

As for why he did not kill him...

He couldn’t stand the overwhelming bad luck himself!

Han Jue was still worried that after killing Su Qi, this fellow would immediately regain his identity as an immortal of the Heavenly Court and find trouble with him.

It was better to be cautious!
