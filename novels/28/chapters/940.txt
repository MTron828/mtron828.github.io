Chapter 942 Primordial Spirit, Hidden Sect’s Banquet

100 trillion years!

It was comparable to the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, a half-step Creator!

Han Jue’s heart sank. So there was really an unknown mighty figure in the Ancient Desolate?

That made sense. Han Jue was already powerful enough, but he still couldn’t see through some unknown areas of the Chaos. If there was no mighty figure protecting him, how could he not spy?

Han Jue chose to continue.

He could still afford 100 trillion years!

Han Jue entered the illusion.

He opened his eyes and discovered that he had arrived in a dark space. The surroundings were filled with wisps of strange purple aura. In the distance, vaguely sinister and mighty shadows floated.

Han Jue discovered that nine figures were gathered together.

They were arguing. “Chaos? It’s just a hypothesis!”

“How ridiculous. We can’t show ourselves at all with the Primordial Fiendcelestial suppressing us!”

“Yes, why scheme? His power is too strong. We’re not his match at all. We can’t control the Primordial Chaos. Opening the Chaos is even more wishful thinking.”

“Brother’s plan can’t be realized. So what if we create the Chaos? With the Primordial Fiendcelestial around, it’s meaningless even if the Chaos exists.”

These nine figures spoke in a language Han Jue had never heard before, but he could understand their meaning and translate it into his own language in his mind with their cultivation realms.

Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

Could the nine figures be the Ninth Chaos and the eight Primordial Spirits?

Previously, he had recorded the relevant information when he checked the Ninth Chaos’ information. The first eight Primordial Spirits had failed to create the Chaos. Only the Ninth Chaos had succeeded.

What were they plotting?

How could it threaten Han Jue if it was only related to the Chaos?

A figure said, “We each have to try to open the Chaos. We have to inherit the failed experiences of our predecessors and place our hopes on our ninth brother.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The other seven figures looked at the thinnest figure.

Han Jue guessed that it was the Ninth Chaos.

The Ninth Chaos said anxiously, “If all my brothers die, I won’t live alone. It’s not my intention to open up the Chaos!

“Actually, isn’t it good for us to be like this? The Primordial Fiendcelestial didn’t bully us. It just didn’t let us create more Primordial Spirits.”

His words attracted the eight Primordial Spirits’ anger, who were so frightened that they did not dare to speak again.

The current Ninth Chaos was completely different from the Ninth Chaos that Han Jue had imagined. It was not so unfathomable and absolutely invincible. Its personality was more like a brat.

A Primordial Spirit said, “We can leave a backup plan even if we fail. We will each leave a trace of the origin mark for our ninth brother. If we really fail, when our ninth brother revives in the future, we will place our hopes on him.”

Han Jue was enlightened. So the eight Primordial Spirits wanted to revive and had the Ninth Chaos’ backing. They could naturally rise forcefully and threaten him.

Not long after, the illusion ended. The subsequent conversation was about how to open up the Chaos and had nothing to do with Han Jue.

His consciousness returned to his body and he opened his eyes.

“I want to know which Primordial Spirit has revived?”

[100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Could it have already grown to the level of the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit?

Han Jue’s heart sank.

He immediately chose to continue.

A tall figure appeared in his mind and lines of words appeared in front of him.

[Zhao Shuangquan: Early-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm, Reincarnation of the Eighth Chaos Primordial Spirit, disciple of a Sage, disciple of the Hidden Sect, Innate Great Creation.]

Eighth Chaos’ reincarnation!

Strange, why didn’t it trigger the notification of the Connate providence bearer?

Han Jue counted with his fingers. So Zhao Shuangquan was born in the past hundred thousand years. He stayed in the third Dao Field and stayed away from the Heavenly Dao.

It was worth mentioning that Zhao Shuangquan was also Su Qi’s personal disciple. He was born with a phenomenon, but such a situation was not unprecedented in the Heavenly Dao. Currently, Zhao Shuangquan had yet to show his unparalleled talent.

This was difficult.

This was his grand-disciple. Han Jue felt that it was not a coincidence that the Eighth Chaos was born in the Heavenly Dao.

“I want to know if the Ninth Chaos arranged for the Eighth Chaos to descend into the Heavenly Dao to scheme against me?”

[100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[No schemes for the time being.)

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that his shout when facing the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was very effective.

He guessed that the Ninth Chaos was afraid that someone would harm his brother, so it was safer to plant him in the Heavenly Dao.

However, the fact that he did not scheme for the time being meant that he might scheme in the future.

After all, Han Jue had deduced that Zhao Shuangquan would threaten him.

“Forget it. This fellow needs time to grow. At most, I’ll find a chance to enslave him. Besides, how can his growth speed compare to mine?”

Han Jue thought silently and felt a sense of danger.

He looked invincible in the Chaos, but it was only in the present. There would always be variables.

The change of power in this world was never determined by talent. Opportunities were more important.

Just like Huang Zuntian, whose potential was average, he had already walked in front of his personal disciples by relying on a huge opportunity.

“I should see the Hidden Sect disciples if there’s a chance,” Han Jue thought silently.

He immediately sent a voice transmission to all the personal disciples. They were to gather in the Hundred Peak Immortal River in a hundred thousand years, including Li Daokong, who was in the Life faction. He also asked Li Xuan’ao to prepare for this Hidden Sect event.

This time, Han Jue planned to bring the Fiendcelestial Army to the Hundred Peak Immortal River, but he still had to hide their bloodline.

He continued cultivating after arranging everything.

However, the personal disciples could not remain calm.

This was the first gathering of the Hidden Sect after millions of years!

In the Myriad Worlds Projection.

Personal disciples appeared one after another. “Did you hear Grandmaster’s arrangements?”

“I heard. This is a good thing. We haven’t seen each other for a long time. It’s time to gather.”

“Yes, our relationship would have long become distant if not for the Myriad Worlds Projection.”

“Master is still the best. He has such a Mystical Power that can cover the Chaos.”

“Hahaha, I’ll let you see my glory when the time comes.”

The personal disciples chatted excitedly.

It was unknown who started it, but they began to talk about their disciples.

They were no longer as young as before. They all had their own inheritances. Not to mention disciples, they even had grand-disciples. Some had already given birth to descendants and established families.

The news quickly reached Han Huang’s ears. He was not in the Myriad Worlds Projection, but the personal disciples could send news through the Great Dao Door.

Generally speaking, the domain where the Great Dao Door was located was not private. Very few mighty figures spread the news here, but this matter was not shameful, so it reached Han Huang’s ears.

Han Huang was excited. He wanted to see his father’s disciples. He immediately told the Evil Heavenly Emperor about this.

“Hahaha, this is a good thing. Your father is usually in seclusion. If there’s no meet-up, he might not know even if his disciples go missing.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled and won Han Huang’s heart.

Then, he changed the topic and said meaningfully, “Huang’er, you have to go this time and help me… Cough cough, you know.”

Han Huang patted his chest and smiled. “Your Majesty, don’t worry. I’ll bring you at least ten geniuses. They can definitely make the Heavenly Court stronger!”
