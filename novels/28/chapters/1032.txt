Chapter 1035 Creating a Race

Immeasurable Destruction Venerable Shi Tian stared at Han Jue and said, “I see. No wonder you’re so confident. A Dao Creator can’t kill another Dao Creator. In that case, we’ll see who’s Great Dao World can laugh until the

end.”

With that, Immeasurable Destruction Venerable Shi Tian vanished into thin air. The blood color that covered this blank domain also vanished.

Han Jue didn’t know what this fellow thought of, but he didn’t care. In any case, he didn’t care about Immeasurable Destruction Venerable Shi Tian.

(Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 3 stars]

Han Jue smiled and jumped back into the Chaos, returning to the Daoist temple of the third Dao Field.

Han Ling opened his eyes and asked, “Father, where did you go earlier?”.

Han Jue replied, “I placed my Great Dao World outside the Chaos.”

Han Ling was moved and hurriedly asked, “Why? Didn’t you say that it was very dangerous?”

Han Jue didn’t hide anything and told her the truth.

Han Ling muttered, “Is that the power of Chaos? It’s trying to absorb other Great Dao Worlds. It seems that the difference in strength between the Great Dao Worlds is greater than I imagined.”

Han Jue smiled. “That’s right. The Chaos will change drastically in the future. Let’s wait and see.”

Han Ling nodded and left.

The chance that she had gone to spar with Han Bashen was high.

Han Jue took out the nine Primordial Fragments and fell into deep thought.

[Primordial Chaos Great Creation: It can create cultivation techniques, create worlds, create races, and create everything. ]

He didn’t lack cultivation techniques and Mystical Powers now. There was no need to use them to strengthen himself.

Thus, he thought of the Ultimate Origin World.

Immeasurable Destruction Venerable Shi Tian had already targeted the Ultimate Origin World and wanted to compare it with his own Great Dao World.

He had to increase his Great Dao World’s strength.

Although there were more than 2,900 Chaotic Fiendcelestials in the Ultimate Origin World, their growth time was inferior to Shi Tian’s, after all. Furthermore, other than the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, most of the Ultimate Origin Lifeforms were still being nurtured. There were no very powerful races for the time being.

He might as well use the Primordial Chaos Great Creation to create a race.

Han Jue felt that it was feasible.

He immediately fused the nine Primordial Fragments.

He began to imagine his race. The nine Primordial Fragments fused and emitted a dazzling purple light.

On the other side, in the Daoist temple next door.

Han Bashen waved his hand and said, “Ancestor, I’m not going! I’m really not going! What’s so fun about the simulation trial? I’m not interested!”

Han Ling frowned. “Why? Weren’t you obsessed before?”

Han Bashen muttered, “It was just for a moment…”

Bored, Han Ling snorted coldly and left.

She wanted to enter Han Jue’s Daoist temple but was blocked. She couldn’t open the door no matter what she did. Guessing that her father might have something on, she went to chat with the others.

In the long years, it was also a good thing to occasionally take the time to relax. It could promote one’s Dao heart to a certain extent.

Several years later, Han Ling returned to the Daoist temple.

The race created by Han Jue using the Primordial Chaos Great Creation had yet to be successfully nurtured and was placed in the depths of his soul.

Han Ling did not ask what he was doing. Her father was always very mysterious. She couldn’t see through him even though her cultivation level had already reached the limit of the Chaos.

Han Jue didn’t cultivate but read the emails.

(Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by cultivators from Shi Tian] x10928763

(Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan…)

(Your son Han Tuo stepped through the void and obtained a Shi Tian’s treasure. He obtained the providence of Shi Tian.]

(Your descendant Han Yao used the Blood Soul Formation Army and his cultivation increased greatly.)

(Your good friend Divine Robe Daoist was attacked by cultivators from Shi Tian] x8022

[Your good friend Pangu was attacked by cultivators from Shi Tian) x62033

(Your disciple Ji Xianshen has stepped into the River of Time.]

(Your disciple Yang Tiandong was attacked by the god of the netherworld and was severely injured.]

Tsk tsk, was a full-scale battle between the Chaos and Shi Tian?

How interesting!

Han Jue looked at Han Ling beside him and discovered that she was also looking at the Chaos.

Han Jue visited Han Yao in his dreams.

Han Yao was very excited to see him. Back then, when he first became an adult, he had cultivated in front of Han Jue for ten thousand years and had always treated him as the person he respected the most.

After some pleasantries, Han Jue explained his intentions, “Come back. Prepare to assist your ancestor Han Ling.”

Han Yao was first stunned, then immediately agreed. Han Jue had already secretly told him about this plan, but after so many years, he had already dominated an area. He was naturally unhappy to submit to Han Ling, but he didn’t dare to disobey the progenitor.

Han Jue ended the dream and visited Han Ye next.

Han Ye was extremely excited to see him.

He would never forget his childhood master. Even after later learning that his master was the progenitor, he always treated Han Jue as his master and not the progenitor. However, he didn’t find a chance to talk to Han Jue during the Chaotic Assembly.

Han Jue asked him about his recent encounters. Han Ye didn’t hide anything from him. He was still very excited after talking for most of the day.

Han Jue smiled and said, “Looks like Dao Sovereign and the others take good care of you. Tell them later that I asked them to come back when they’re free.”

Han Ye nodded. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Han Jue added, “Leave them and come back. Help your ancestor Han Ling achieve great things.”

Han Ye was stunned. Assist Han Ling?

Unlike Han Yao, he was straightforward. He asked seriously, “Progenitor, why? Can she be stronger than me?”

Han Jue smiled. “Spar with her after you return. This will be your greatest opportunity. The Great Dao Supreme Realm is your limit if you continue following Dao Sovereign and the others. This will be your only chance if you want to surpass the Great Dao Supreme Realm. This opportunity will far exceed your imagination.”

Han Ye was silent.

He believed that Han Jue wouldn’t lie to him. He couldn’t help but recall Han Ling back then, that fierce woman…

In the end, Han Ye agreed and decided to bid farewell to Dao Sovereign and the others. Han Jue told him the location of the universe of stars.

The dream shattered.

Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at his daughter. “Ling’er, do you want to go out with me?”

Stunned, Han Ling asked, “Why are we going out?”

Han Jue said meaningfully, “You’ve been observing the Chaos all these years. Your cultivation has already reached the limit. Your Great Dao World will constantly evolve on its own. Seclusion is not enough if you want to reach a higher level. You already have a plan. Why hide it from me?”

Han Ling took a deep breath and smiled. “A father is a father. You can guess what your daughter wants to do.”

“Tell me your plan.”

“My Great Dao World was created too late. I’ll be weaker than the other Great Dao Worlds even if the Endless Era arrives. I plan to recruit geniuses in the Chaos. My Great Dao World will have a certain foundation when the Endless Era arrives then. In addition, I guess that the Endless Era will be an unprecedented era of competition. You’ll have no choice but to fight if you want to occupy a place and not be devoured.”

Han Ling spoke extremely seriously, completely different from her usual self.

Han Jue felt that it made sense.

Even his Great Dao World couldn’t hide in the Dao Field. He had to go out, let alone the others.

Han Jue said, “Han Ye, Han Yao, and Han Bashen will be your subordinates. Use them well.”

Han Ling smiled. “Will they listen to me? Han Bashen is fine, but the other two…”

“Subdue them with your strength. Fight them in the simulation trial. Whoever wins will be the leader.”

“Will this hurt their self-esteem?”
