Chapter 1047 Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential

“Oh? Not bad,” Han Jue responded and praised.

Shan’e was depressed. “Progenitor, I’m a Great Dao Sage! Those seniors told me that I have already reached the peak of the Chaos when I passed the door of the Great Dao!”

Han Jue smiled. “That’s the peak of the Chaos. It’s not my expectations for you, understand?”

Shan’e was stunned. “Isn’t the Great Dao Sage Realm enough?”

Han Jue said, “To the Chaos, it’s indeed enough. But not to me. I have many Great Dao Sages under me. There are even many existences that surpass the Great Dao Sage Realm.”

Shan’e was stunned.

He knew that the progenitor was very strong, but he didn’t know that he was the Divine

Might Heavenly Sage.

Apart from the people Han Jue specially

treated, all living beings had already

forgotten his name and only knew the Divine

Might Heavenly Sage.

Shan’e came from the lower realm, so he naturally didn’t know that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was Han Jue.

The personal disciples Han Jue had brought him to see before didn’t mention this, either. They felt that it was natural and there was naturally no need to forcefully mention it.

Han Jue smiled. “Do you want to enter a simulation trial with me?”

Shan’e instantly smiled. “Alright! Progenitor! I’ll surprise you!”

In the past few years, he had accumulated abundant combat experience. Even if he was not the progenitor’s match, he could at least surprise him.

Without another word, Han Jue immediately pulled him into the simulation trial.

A breath later, Shan’e opened his eyes. He was in a daze. His body trembled and his face was filled with fear.

Han Jue continued to check his emails.

After a long while…

Shan’e still hadn’t come back to his senses

after he finished reading all the emails.

Han Jue frowned. Was he too ruthless?

He immediately said, “Shan’e?”

His voice was like a thunderclap, recalling in

the mind of Shan’e, waking him up.

Shan’e came back to his senses and sat on the

ground. His bearing was not of a Great Dao

Sage but similar to a mortal.

Han Jue snorted. “Is that all you’ve got? I thought you were strong. Stop posturing.” Shan’e didn’t know what posturing was, but it

was probably bragging.

He lowered his head in shame. The previous battle was like a nightmare that could not go

away.

Han Jue said, “Cultivate well and don’t slack off. You’re still far from it. As long as someone is stronger than you, what happened to you when you were young might happen again. Do you understand?”

Shan’e paled as he hurriedly nodded.

Han Jue suddenly thought of Fairy Xi Xuan. He looked over and saw that Fairy Xi Xuan, who was far away in the Hundred Peak Immortal River, had already become a Great Dao Sage.

He immediately teleported to the main Dao

Field.

Shan’e heaved a sigh of relief and smiled

bitterly.

“Shan’e, Shan’e. You’re ridiculous. How dare

you challenge the progenitor?”

Shan’e was filled with regret.

Half a day later.

Han Jue fetched Fairy Xi Xuan and Chang

Yue’er.

Xing Hongxuan took the initiative to

entertain them and talked about the past of

the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. The three women

sighed.

Han Jue left and didn’t disturb them from

catching up. If Chang Yue’er wanted to go out and wander around, a clone in the Dao Field would send her out.

The universe of stars outside the third Dao

Field was already extremely abundant. There

were all sorts of cultivation systems and civilizations. If she was bored, Chang Yue’er could go and play. Her life would not be in

danger. After all, this was Liu Bei’s jurisdiction.

Thinking of the universe of stars, Han Jue

thought of Hong Jun, who had acknowledged Liu Bei as his master.

Hong Jun had already left for tens of millions

of years and had not been heard from since. Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and began to deduce him. He discovered that Hong Jun was not in the Chaos but had arrived at the Transcendent Great Dao World. He had preached for ten million years and created his

own lineage. He was clearly walking the path of the Dao Ancestor.

Han Jue naturally wouldn’t interfere in Hong

Jun’s actions. Since ancient times, the Dao Ancestor had never schemed against him and even tacitly agreed to give him the Heavenly Dao. The two of them helped each other and

there was no need to become enemies, even if Han Jue had already surpassed the Dao Ancestor.

Han Jue watched for a while and suddenly saw

Han Huang.

Han Huang was transcending the Great Dao

World and fighting for another Supreme Rule.

He had just succeeded!

Was he gathering the Supreme Rules of the

various worlds?

Interesting.

Han Jue could see that the Primordial World

had already been established in the depths of Han Huang’s soul. Han Jue grew nostalgic after seeing that familiar scene. Primordial Chaos was enough for Han Huang

to develop for countless years. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Han Jue wouldn’t stay in the Ultimate Origin World. Other than constantly raising his cultivation realm, even his physique had to constantly transform. He would leave the other Dao Creators far behind and form an arbitrary advantage.

Han Jue didn’t want to restrain Han Huang

but let him cause trouble.

Han Jue could still revive even if a huge commotion was caused.

He had long accepted a wisp of Han Huang’s

soul to facilitate his revival. He believed that his son also had his own methods. However, only the soul fragment in the Dao

Field could help him revive if he angered a Dao Creator.

Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued

cultivating.

Shan’e also adjusted his state of mind and meditated again. His gaze on Han Jue became

firm.

“Progenitor, just you wait. I won’t disappoint

you!” Shan’e swore in his heart that he could not lose face anymore.

Creation Emperor Court, Heavenly Hall.

Han Ling sat on a high seat with a dignified posture. Her gaze landed on the eight people

in the hall.

Han Ye, Han Yao, and Han Bashen were all

here, as well as the other five Great Dao Sages.

“My ancestor Han Huang is too strong. I can’t snatch him at all. Why don’t we find the Supreme Rules of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World?”

Han Yao suggested helplessly.

Han Ye snorted, but he did not refute. Han Huang’s strength almost traumatized him. There was indeed no need to fight to the

death.

Han Bashen smiled and said, “I think that

Supreme Rules are useless other than causing trouble.”

Han Ling said, “This trip doesn’t mean that you must obtain the Supreme Rules. I just want you to get used to it and sense the top strength of the Chaos. After this battle, you

Court

should be able to put away the arrogance in your hearts. Next, the Creation Emperor plans to recruit cultivators, especially Freedom Sages. The more, the better.

“Han Yao, lead the five Dao Emperors to the netherworld. I want to establish a force there. You have to gain a foothold no matter what

method you use.” Han Yao immediately cupped his hands and accepted the order. Then, he left with the five

Great Dao Sages.

Han Ye and Han Bashen were also about to leave when Han Ling stopped them.

After Han Yao and the other three disappeared, Han Ling said, “I’m preparing to open up our Great Dao World in the netherworld. What do you think?” Han Ye was stunned. “In the netherworld?” “The netherworld separates the living and the dead, but it’s difficult for a Sage to appear there, so it’s ignored by the living world. I think that the netherworld is feasible. The netherworlds of the various Great Dao Worlds are connected. I feel that there’s a mystery

hidden here. I’ll leave the matter of recruiting Freedom Sages to you. You can use your other identities and infiltrate the netherworld. Don’t tell Han Yao.”

Han Ling instructed. She raised her right

hand and waved it gently. Two Emperor Soldier shadows landed on Han Ye and Han Bashen. Immediately after, they covered them and transformed into Emperor Soldiers.

Han Ye sized himself up and clicked his tongue in wonder.

Han Bashen asked curiously, “Your Majesty, what should we do when we go to the

netherworld?”

Han Ling’s expression did not change as she

said, “I’m looking for a treasure called the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential. It’s hidden in the Yellow Spring. I don’t know where it is, but I’ve deduced that by obtaining the Ultimate Origin Power, one can obtain

supreme creation.”
