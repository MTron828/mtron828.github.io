Chapter 72: Sixth Level of the Void Amalgamation Realm, Fusang Tree

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Han Jue created a Mystical Power that caused a huge commotion in the world.

The world was vast and the Great Yan was only a tiny place. Other than a Daoist surnamed Huang, no one believed that the mighty figure who had created the Eternal Sword Dao was hidden in the Great Yan.

Thirteen years later, no one mentioned it again.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Han Jue’s cultivation level also successfully broke through to the sixth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm.

It was all thanks to Xun Chang’an. His presence in the cave abode increased the Spirit Qi, also increasing Han Jue’s cultivation speed in the process.

After all, this was an Ancient Spiritual Ginseng. It was equivalent to a human-shaped treasure. It was also a natural treasure in the Immortal Realm.

[You are already 300 years old. Another 100 years have passed on the path of cultivation. You have the following choices:]

[1: Exit seclusion immediately and show the world how powerful you are. You can obtain an egg of a divine beast of providence.]

[2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and hide your achievements. You can obtain a Numinous Treasure.]

Han Jue silently chose the second option.

[You chose to cultivate in a low profile manner and obtained a Numinous Treasure.]

[Congratulations on obtaining a third-grade Numinous Treasure—Heart Protecting Immortal Chain]

[Heart Protecting Immortal Chain: Third-grade defensive Numinous Treasure. It can automatically absorb the Heaven and Earth Spirit Qi until it reaches full capacity. It will not affect its master’s cultivation and will automatically protect its master during battle.]

It was a defensive Numinous Treasure again, and it did not use up an existing spot on his body!

System, you know me best!

Han Jue thought happily. He took out the Heart Protecting Immortal Chain. It was a crystal chain, exquisite and beautiful.

After a while, the Heart Protecting Immortal Chain recognized its owner. Han Jue wore it on his neck.

Xun Chang’an was secretly envious.

Master has so many Dharma treasures!

Could this be his inheritance?

Master can only take it out and wear it after breaking through to a certain cultivation level?

Han Jue was in a good mood. He ignored Xun Chang’an’s gaze and checked his emails.

Who had suffered the most in all these years?

[Your disciple Yang Tiandong was attacked by beasts] x3911

[Your good friend Mo Fuchou was attacked by a righteous cultivator] x672

[Your disciple Su Qi was attacked by a fiendish cultivator] x3028

[Your good friend Zhou Fan has killed countless people. His negative karma is overwhelming.]

[Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked by righteous cultivators] x105

[Your Divine Pet Chaotic Heavenly Dog was attacked by a fiendish cultivator] x4003

[Your disciple Su Qi was captured by the Great Jin Dynasty’s royalty]

[Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck. The Great Jin Dynasty has encountered a thousand-year calamity of locusts, floods, and plagues. The mountains and rivers are on the verge of collapsing.]

…

Wow!

Han Jue’s disciples and divine pet finally reached the top three on the list of being beaten with their relentless efforts. They had finally done it!

Forget about Su Qi, he was a jinx.

Yang Tiandong and the Chaotic Heavenly Dog were truly worrisome.

Zhou Fan was really a demon!

Han Jue had a feeling.

Mo Fuchou might have been forced, but Zhou Fan was a demon by nature.

After all, what he had done in the inner sect had been criticized.

Han Jue shook his head and stopped thinking about it.

He stood up and said, “Disciple, follow me out. I’ll teach you and the Black Hell Chicken some techniques.”

Xun Chang’an was pleasantly surprised when he heard this, and he hurriedly stood up and followed.

…

In the Endless Desert, countless locusts spread out like dust.

A figure moved forward in the storm of locusts. He walked unhurriedly as if he was taking a stroll. The locusts along the way did not dare to approach him.

It was Su Qi!

Su Qi had a proud look on his face as he thought to himself, “Master is really capable. Even the locust plague that’s able to destroy a dynasty is staying away from me.”

After so many years, he had experienced many tribulations, but he had always been able to survive them.

He tried to call Han Jue, but there was no response.

He finally understood.

His master was testing him.

He was meant to enjoy the feeling of being alone.

After all, his master was always in seclusion alone and did not say a word.

Only by enduring absolute loneliness could one achieve immortality and seek the Dao!

After that, Su Qi no longer called Han Jue and relaxed.

Not long ago, he had been captured by the Great Jin Dynasty’s Imperial Family, but he had not panicked. Instead, he enjoyed it. He fought with them, and the outcome had been as he had guessed. However, when he had truly been unable to defeat his enemies or escape death, his master had acted.

Su Qi thought as he advanced.

He had been traveling for decades. He looked travel-worn and tired, but his eyes were bright.

Before long…

Su Qi saw a hundred-foot-tall crooked tree ahead. There was a figure under it.

He immediately rushed over.

The locust storm stopped and began to return, no longer chasing after him.

Not noticing this anomaly, Su Qi hurried to the old tree.

A ragged old man sat under the tree, his face as wrinkled as the bark behind him.

Su Qi cupped his fists and asked, “Senior, is the North State ahead?”

Without opening his eyes, the elder said, “Yes, the North State.”

Hearing this, Su Qi suddenly had the urge to cry.

Decades!

Almost a hundred years!

He had finally arrived at his destination!

The North State!

He had dreamed countless times of reaching the North State.

Tears flowed down his face.

He immediately turned around and knelt down.

His eyes seemed to say, Master, do you see this?

I didn’t let you down!

The old man opened his eyes and looked at him with a strange expression. He asked, “Are you that happy to reach the North State? Do you know where it is?”

Su Qi stood up and turned to him. He wiped his tears and smiled. “I don’t know, but the Demon Taming Sect is in the North State, right?”

The old man frowned and asked, “Are you related to the Demon Taming Sect?”

“I want to join them!” Su Qi said firmly and confidently, just like when he had first joined the Jade Pure Sect.

The old man shook his head and said, “The threshold of the Demon Taming Sect is extremely high. Even if you already have a Golden Core realm cultivation, it’s not that easy to join. The North State is a place where demons dance. Junior, let me give you a piece of advice. Don’t enter it, this is the Yellow Springs of the mortal world.”

Su Qi smiled.

What am I afraid of?

Someone is backing me!

Immediately, Su Qi cupped his fists at him and walked towards the northern region with his head held high.

The old man revealed a mocking smile and did not dissuade him.

…

Five years later.

The Great Yan welcomed a rare snowstorm. The entire Jade Pure Sect was covered in snow, looking as beautiful as a painting.

Han Jue walked out of the cave abode and stood at the edge of the cliff. All he saw was white.

Having lived for three hundred years, this was the first time he had encountered such heavy snow.

He couldn’t help but think of the Jinx.

This sign…

Could it be that the jinx had returned?

As Han Jue was thinking, three lines of words suddenly appeared in front of him.

[Detected that the ten-thousand-year-old demon is about to awaken. You have the following choices:]

[1: Come out and kill the demon to save the world. You can obtain a Numinous Treasure and a Mystical Power inheritance.]

[2: Continue cultivating and stay away from danger. Protect yourself and you can obtain a random natural treasure seed.]

Ten-thousand-year-old demon?

It sounded very savage!

I’d be a fool to try and kill it!

Han Jue chose the second option without hesitation.

Han Jue didn’t embark on the path of cultivation to save people, but to live longer.

[You chose to continue cultivating and stay away from danger. You will obtain a random natural treasure seed.]

[Congratulations on obtaining the Fusang Tree Seed]

[Fusang Tree: Divine Tree of Heaven and Earth. It can increase the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth. Ten thousand years later, it can attract the Golden Crow. A million years later, it can connect to other worlds.]
