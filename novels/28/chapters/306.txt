Chapter 309 The Dark Forbidden Lord’s Forces

“Alright, I’ll do my best,” Huang Zuntian replied. Although he was extremely unwilling, he didn’t dare to go against the White Crane’s will.

The White Crane nodded in satisfaction. “Work hard. I still think highly of you.”

Huang Zuntian hurriedly bowed.

After the White Crane left, he clutched the scroll in his hand.

“Why can’t you cultivate diligently like your seniors and not cause trouble or show off? You’ve clearly suffered greatly. Is there something wrong with your brains?”

Huang Zuntian ridiculed in his heart. How many years had it been since he became the Island Master? What nonsense was this?

Sigh!

Huang Zuntian fell into endless worry.

It had been twenty years since they were attacked by the Nine Netherworld Dragon.

Han Jue’s cultivation made progress again. As he became stronger, the speed at which the Stellar Primordial Body devoured the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus became faster and faster. In addition, the Buzhou Divine Flower was producing Connate Qi, so his cultivation speed could be said to be steadily increasing.

According to Han Jue’s estimations, he would probably break through to the Rank Five Immortal Emperor Realm in two or three

was still considered stable.

After the Immeasurable Calamity ended this time, reaching the Deity Realm was definitely guaranteed. As for higher realms, he still had to work harder.

Of course, he had to be alive to achieve all these.

Han Jue chased Dao Comprehension Sword out and took out the Book of Misfortune to curse the Heavenly Dao Buddha. At the same time, he checked his emails.

[Your good friend Zhang Guxing was cursed by a mysterious curse.]

[Your good friend Di Hongye was cursed by a mysterious curse.] (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has entered Kunlun.]

(Your good friend Zhou Fan has entered Kunlun)

…

Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

Many of his good friends had been cursed by a mysterious curse, and many had entered Kunlun.

Something was wrong.

Indeed, someone was pretending to be the Dark Forbidden Lord.

What was going on with Kunlun?

Why were there so many people heading to Kunlun during the Immeasurable Calamity? Furthermore, they were all people with average cultivation levels. It seemed like something big was about to happen.

Han Jue was secretly vigilant.

A month later, he put down the Book of Misfortune and continued cultivating.

More and more factions appeared and interfered with the Immeasurable Calamity. Apart from keeping a low profile, he had to hurry up and become stronger.

(Han Ming has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 1 star.)

Han Jue had just started cultivating when he saw this notification.

He was stunned.

Why did this kid suddenly have a favorable impression of him?

Han Jue didn’t think too much about it. He didn’t want to acknowledge this younger brother at all. The reason why he didn’t curse Han Ming was that he was afraid of being discovered by Immortal Emperor Samsara.

The blue sky was filled with white clouds. Immortal cranes lined up in rows. From time to time, immortal birds, mounts, and various flying Dharma treasures flew past.

In the forest was a stone pavilion. There were three men in the pavilion. They were Fang Liang, Zhou Fan, and Mo Fuchou.

The three of them sat around the stone table and drank. They began to talk about the past and sighed.

“We can join forces in this Immortal Talent Meeting. After all, our foundation is too shallow.” Zhou Fan suggested.

Fang Liang smiled. “I still haven’t returned the favor from the last time you saved me. We naturally have to work together.”

Mo Fuchou shook his head and smiled. “Don’t think like that. Actually, we didn’t help at all. I’m ashamed.”

Fang Liang said, “By the way, do you know the rules of this Immortal Talent Meeting?”

Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou shook their heads.

As the three of them chatted, cultivators flew past the forest. Their target was all Kunlun.

Kunlun wasn’t far from them, but they weren’t in a hurry to go there.

Zhou Fan said with anticipation, “It’s said that there’s a way to achieve the Emperor Realm in this Immortal Talent Meeting. I wonder if it’s true.”

Mo Fuchou smiled and said, “I want to join the Chan School and avoid this calamity.”

Fang Liang smiled. He glanced at the

man was walking forward.

Fang Liang’s pupils widened and he was stunned.

Zhou Fan noticed his expression and couldn’t help but look over. He was also stunned.

Mo Fuchou followed their gaze and asked in surprise, “Brother Han?”

The man in black, who was advancing, seemed to have heard Mo Fuchou’s words and couldn’t help but turn to look at them.

Zhou Fan shook his head and laughed. “Oh, we got the wrong person. Han Jue is better looking than him.”

Fang Liang nodded.

When the man in black heard that he suddenly flashed into the pavilion and asked in a low voice, “Is the person you’re talking about Han Jue?”

The three of them were shocked and looked at him warily.

Fang Liang drew his sword and asked in a low voice, “Who are you?”

The black-robed man said coldly, “I’m Han Ming.”

Han Ming?

The three of them were stunned again. This name was too similar to Han Jue’s name. The two of them also looked alike.

Could it be…

“Hmph, is Han Jue here?” Han Ming snorted and asked.

Anticipation flashed across his eyes.

ascend. Even if he did, he wouldn’t come to such a grand event.”

He had yet to ascend?

Han Ming frowned and asked in a low voice, “What’s his cultivation level now? Why isn’t he ascending?”

Zhou Fan was unhappy with his tone and snorted. “Who are you? Why are you asking about my Brother Han’s cultivation?”.

Han Ming ignored him and stared at Fang Liang. “You’re his grand-disciple? What sect are you from?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Fang Liang did not answer.

Han Ming frowned even harder. He was about to speak when a bell suddenly sounded, resounding through the world.

“The Immortal Talent Meeting is about to begin. Those who arrive first will choose their spots.” Fang Liang, Zhou Fan, and Mo Fuchou immediately rushed out of the stone pavilion.

Han Ming’s expression changed slightly as he hurriedly caught up. They weren’t the only ones. The immortals who were slowly advancing from all directions began to charge at full speed.

Time passed quickly.

Another ten years passed. Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and took out the Heavenly Dao Token to contact Di Taibai.

“What has my disciple Long Hao and grand-disciple Fang Liang been doing recently?” Han Jue asked first.

He had previously seen the two of them encounter all sorts of attacks. There were demons, cultivators, and even immemorial lifeforms. It seemed like the two of them should be together and were involved in the same danger.

Di Taibai smiled and said, “They went to the Immortal Talent Meeting. It’s a grand event held by the Chan School in Kunlun. Don’t worry, it’s a fortuitous encounter. Nothing will happen to them. They will only become stronger.” Immortal Talent Meeting? No wonder so many good friends had entered Kunlun recently.

Han Jue asked curiously, “What does the Chan School want to do? Isn’t it the Immeasurable Calamity now?”

Di Taibai replied, “The Chan School wants to form good relationships. No matter who wins or loses, they will owe karma to the Chan School. After all, the younger generation of the various factions has obtained the fortuitous encounters there.”

I see.

Han Jue didn’t know how to judge this method.

“By the way, aren’t you in the netherworld? Be careful. The King of Hell has announced his independence and drew a clear line with the Heavenly Court. If you are targeted by him, don’t reveal your identity as a member of the Heavenly Court. Otherwise, you will attract even greater hatred.” Di Taibai reminded.

Han Jue wasn’t surprised.

The King of Hell was so strong, he indeed had the qualification to be independent.

Di Taibai sighed with emotion. “The calamity this time is too chaotic. The various races have made an appearance together, and the situation is unknown. For the time being, I’m unable to see who will laugh until the end. Especially the Dark Forbidden Lord, whose forces are too enormous. More and more races and forces in the Immortal World are claiming to be his subordinates.”
