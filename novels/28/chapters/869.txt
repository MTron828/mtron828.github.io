Chapter 870 Qingluan’er’s Surprise

Han Jue naturally had a plan now that he took out Qingluan’er’s soul.

He wanted her to become the master of this universe.

Good things should not go to outsiders.

Moreover, Qingluan’er would definitely think of a way to keep up with his immortality if she revived. Otherwise, what was the point of reviving? Han Jue didn’t lack women.

Since he was going to revive her, Qingluan’er had to accompany him completely.

Han Jue began to use the power of creation.

After so many years of comprehension, he finally grasped a trace of the power of creation. Although it was far from being as mysterious as the Creation Rule, it was not difficult to revive a living being.

Qingluan’er’s soul was intact. She only needed to recover her body.

That day, Qingluan’er’s body was created and she became an Immortal Emperor.

.

Her body wouldn’t be able to withstand her soul if her cultivation was lower.

...

Qingluan’er lay on the bed in white clothes. They were casually created by Han Jue.

She slowly opened her eyes, her gaze confused.

Memories surged from the depths of her mind, causing her eyes to widen.

“Was I… reincarnated?” Qingluan’er muttered to herself. She subconsciously raised her hand and discovered that she was not a baby.

What happened?

She wanted to sit up, but she accidentally broke through the Daoist temple and landed in the sky.

She stopped in the air, her body trembling.

“What’s going on… This spirit energy…”

Qingluan’er widened her beautiful eyes and sized up her body in disbelief.

She could feel a surging power in her body. She couldn’t help but think of spirit energy.

Although she was a mortal in the past, she knew about cultivation.

She looked down and discovered a Daoist temple on the vast mountain. After she broke through the top, it was recovering from an illusion.

“Could it be that I did not die?”

Qingluan’er frowned and tried her best to control her body to slowly land.

She carefully walked into the Daoist temple and asked, “Is anyone here?”

Liu Bei was still accompanying Jiang Jueshi, so the third Dao Field was empty and quiet.

Crack

The door to the Daoist temple suddenly opened. Unable to see the situation inside, Qingluan’er became even more nervous, not daring to enter rashly.

In the Daoist temple, Han Jue stood up and tidied his clothes.

If he had not reacted quickly, Qingluan’er would have been lost. The Daoist temple was not brittle enough for an Immortal Emperor to destroy.

Han Jue waited for a while. Qingluan’er had yet to enter, so he had no choice but to raise his hand and suck her in.

Qingluan’er couldn’t control her body and was sucked into the Daoist temple.

Terror and despair filled her heart.

She subconsciously closed her eyes. When she landed on the ground, she opened her eyes and was stunned.

“Hus-Husband?” Qingluan’er shouted in surprise and rubbed her eyes.

Han Jue smiled. “What? Are you still afraid of me? If not for me, who can help you revive?”

Qingluan’er immediately put down her doubts and pounced into his arms when she heard that.

“Husband, am I dreaming? You really revived me? Also, why are you so young?”

Qingluan’er kept asking. She had too many questions.

.

Han Jue pulled her to a seat and explained, “I was in pain after you died. I wanted to wait and die of old age. I didn’t expect to encounter an immortal and obtain the opportunity to cultivate. After millions of years of cultivation, I created a world and obtained a great opportunity before reviving you.”

“Wait! Millions of years?”

Qingluan’er was shocked and looked incredulous.

Han Jue said, “That’s right. About five million years have passed. We’re no longer in the Immortal World.”

Qingluan’er hurriedly asked, “What about Tuo’er?”

Han Jue remained silent.

Qingluan’er’s face instantly turned pale. She asked with a trembling voice, “He’s already… right… after so many years, even immortals have to die…”

Han Jue sighed. “He’s not dead.”

“Huh?”

Qingluan’er’s tears stopped.

Han Jue said helplessly, “He’s still alive, but he’s already grown up. He naturally won’t follow me. He even has descendants.”

Qingluan’er punched him and said coquettishly, “Husband, you’re teasing me.”

Qingluan’er was overjoyed upon learning that her son was still alive.

She believed Han Jue. After all, children had to grow up and live their own lives. She didn’t stay by her parents’ side back then, either.

“Tell me about your experiences over the years.” Qingluan’er pulled his hand and urged.

Han Jue said, “Let’s talk about it in the future. Get used to your Dharmic powers first.”

Then, he began to teach her.

Qingluan’er’s body was in its prime. In addition to Han Jue, her hundred years of experience were not worth mentioning. Soon, she regained the mentality of a young woman and even acted coquettishly.

A year passed in the blink of an eye.

Qingluan’er had completely adapted to the power of an Immortal Emperor. This year was the sweetest time she had ever lived. Only she and Han Jue were together with no worries.

Most importantly, she knew that she and her husband could still rely on each other for countless years.

She even felt like she was dreaming.

On this day, the two of them put on their clothes and sat by the bed.

Han Jue said, “Alright, I should cultivate too. I need to cultivate in seclusion for a hundred thousand years each time. Don’t disturb me if there’s nothing important. You can wander outside, but you can only stay within a radius of a million miles. This is my Dao Field and is isolated from the outside world. You can’t go out even if you want to.”

“Ah? A hundred thousand years?”

Qingluan’er was stunned.

Han Jue ignored her and closed his eyes.

The reason he hid the truth from Qingluan’er was that he couldn’t be bothered to explain. Furthermore, he wanted to create a sense of urgency so that Qingluan’er could cultivate in peace.

As for Xing Hongxuan, Xuan Qingjun, and the other women, Han Jue was not worried that Qingluan’er would mind their existence. Back when the two of them were in the mortal world, Qingluan’er had taken the initiative to take in a concubine for him, but he had rejected her.

Time passed year after year.

Qingluan’er was a little impatient after cultivating in seclusion for a few years. Thus, she wandered outside the Daoist temple for a few days before returning to continue cultivating Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She finally began to get used to the boring cultivation after a thousand years.

In the void.

The five Divine Punishers stepped on the divine light and advanced. Han Tuo stood at the front and frowned.

Yi Tian walked to his side and asked in a low voice, “You seem to be uneasy recently?”

Han Tuo said, “Indeed. For some reason, I keep feeling a familiar aura, but I can’t be sure who it is.”

He frowned. He had never felt this way.

“Could it be that your younger brother has broken through?” Yi Tian asked teasingly.

Back then, Han Tuo felt uneasy because of that mysterious younger brother and had no choice but to ask the Evil Heavenly Emperor to question that unknown transcendent existence.

“No, it was very oppressive back then. I just feel that it’s familiar now and I don’t feel any discomfort.” Han Tuo shook his head.

He smiled and said, “I wonder what realm my younger brother is at now.”

Yi Tian smiled. “He’s probably stronger than you. He can suppress you just by relying on his bloodline.”

Han Tuo did not agree. “That’s a good thing if that’s the case.”

The other three Great Dao Divine Spirits approached and asked curiously who Han Tuo’s younger brother was.
