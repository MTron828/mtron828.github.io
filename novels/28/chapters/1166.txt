Chapter 1167 Chaos Submits

“Lord? He died long ago!”

The white-haired man snorted coldly with a disdainful expression. He raised his arms and the three demon statues behind him grew

taller. Soon, they became even larger than the Transcendent Divine Hall.

The mighty figures below were in an uproar. They were furious and thought that the white-haired man had killed the Lord. The first people to attack were Han Jue’s children and descendants. Immediately after, the other mighty figures all attacked.

More than a hundred thousand Great Dao Supremes attacked together. How terrifying was that? A strong light burst out, causing the blank domain to darken.

The illusion shattered.

Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality.

“Who is that white-haired man?” Han Jue asked in his mind.

[Unable to deduce its karma. He might not exist or have a Supreme Treasure.]

He could deduce the Origin Divine Millet but not the white-haired man, it meant that the white-haired man was not the Origin Divine Millet.

Then who was it?

The birth of the Origin Divine Millet was for that white-haired man?

Han Jue frowned and pondered.

He asked in his mind, “Will the Origin Divine Millet threaten me?”

[10 duodecillion years of origin lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[No, the Origin Divine Millet is not offensive unless it is controlled by someone.]

Controlled by someone…

Han Jue disappeared from the lotus throne and appeared next to the basic rules to face the Origin Divine Millet.

The Origin Divine Millet didn’t panic when it saw him. Instead, it approached him.

Its snake form looked terrifying and cold, but Han Jue clearly felt that it wanted to get close to him.

Han Jue reached out and touched its head. In

an instant, his calm heart rippled.

They had established some special

connection.

“Won’t it be more appropriate if I control the Origin Divine Millet?” Han Jue thought silently. He had to be wary of the

white-haired man in the illusion.

Han Jue took the crystalline Origin Divine

Millet and returned to the Daoist temple.

“Stay by my side in the future.” Han Jue

smiled.

The Origin Divine Millet flew out of his palm and became two meters long. It wrapped around him like the Strange Deity back then, getting close to him.

Han Jue was amused. He didn’t expect the Origin Space-time to become his pet.

He glanced at the Ninth Chaos in the corner.

He still didn’t succeed in enslaving this fellow. Han Jue was waiting anxiously now. Perhaps he could learn the white-haired man’s identity from the Ninth Chaos.

He searched the entire Endless Era but did not see the white-haired man. There was also a possibility that the white-haired man had yet to be born.

Since he couldn’t find the other party, Han Jue could only work hard to become stronger.

He closed his eyes after some thinking.

His clones returned one after another in the

next few hundred years. As for the descendants who had obtained the Creation Heaven’s Chosen, they were already

independent.

…

Time passed.

Another five hundred million years went by.

Han Jue was already 1.8 billion years old. His name had completely disappeared in the eyes of all living beings. Only by reaching the Great Dao Supreme Realm could one hear of his existence.

He had accumulated fifty Creation Heaven’s

Chosen attempts. As for the reward, it had to be triggered once every billion years.

Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled in

satisfaction.

His cultivation level had increased greatly in

this period. This feeling of becoming stronger was truly wonderful.

The Ultimate Origin World gained two more Supreme Rules, but they were still hidden. However, the mighty figures could sense the increase in the Ultimate Origin World and guessed that Han Jue was getting stronger. A Great Dao World also appeared in the

Ultimate Origin World. Because the Ultimate Origin World was at the level of a Creator Lord, it could accommodate Great Dao Worlds and not devour them like before.

The other mighty figures felt even less pressure after someone successfully established the Great Dao World. The news

that the Ultimate Origin World could withstand other Great Dao Worlds quickly

spread, attracting more mighty figures to

join.

Han Jue looked at a figure meditating beside him, the Ninth Chaos.

The Ninth Chaos had already been successfully enslaved and transformed into an Ultimate Origin Lifeform.

The Ninth Chaos opened his eyes and bowed respectfully upon Sensing his gaze. Han Jue asked him to sit down. The Origin Divine Millet came over curiously. “Where is your mental demon?” Han Jue

asked.

The Ninth Chaos replied, “I’m not sure either. I severed my connection with him when I split him out. I was plotting to deal with you FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

when I last contacted him. At that time, I was already prepared to fail, so I completely separated from him. Even I don’t know where he is or what he will do.”

It seemed that the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity’s outcome had alerted the Ninth Chaos. He was not blind. He was prepared for the

worst.

Han Jue felt a trace of admiration for this once-invincible person. This was also the first enemy who could escape the Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison but still take revenge on him.

“Do you know this person?”

Han Jue waved his right hand, and the

white-haired man’s figure appeared in front of him.

The Ninth Chaos frowned. “I don’t know him,

but I’ve seen him before. A long time ago, when I was comprehending the rules, I dreamed of him. He replaced me and faced the resistance of all living beings. This dream happened more than once. I’ve also been on guard, so I suppressed every Dao Creator. However, he never appeared after countless years, so I let this matter go.’

The Ninth Chaos had also seen him in his dreams?

Han Jue was interested.

person would

Could it be that every invincible face this white-haired man? Han Jue asked some more questions. The

Ninth Chaos told him everything he knew. The Ninth Chaos’ understanding of the blank domain was inferior to Han Jue’s. He didn’t even know what the basic rules were. This fellow was already at the perfected Dao

Creator Realm, but he was still far from becoming a Creator Lord.

Han Jue said, “Go out. You can sit whatever

you want in the future as long as it doesn’t affect me.”

“Yes.”

The Ninth Chaos nodded. Han Jue waved his

hand and sent him out.

He continued to think about the white-haired

man.

Who was that fellow?

Could it be formed by the will of the blank domain?

Blank Domain, unknown place.

The Ninth Chaos appeared under a huge

divine tree. He sat on a mat and waved his hand to create eight Chaotic Wills. The First Chaos looked at him in surprise and asked, “You’re still alive?”

The Ninth Chaos said, “Yes, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is kind and didn’t kill us.”

The other Chaotic Wills heaved a sigh of relief. They understood what the Ninth Chaos

meant. They were also afraid of fighting Han Jue to death. The difference between the two was too great. It would not be beneficial to them if they fought to the death.

The Ninth Chaos continued, “All of you will cultivate here in the future. In ten billion years, I will no longer interfere in the matters

of all living beings. You should put down your obsession and cultivate well.”

The other Chaos had no objections. Figures appeared at this moment. They were the Formless Transcendent Deity, the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity, the Chaotic

Consciousness, and Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable.

They were all shocked to see the Ninth Chaos.

The Ninth Chaos had contacted them previously, but he had not appeared. He did not hide his aura this time. Wasn’t he afraid of being discovered by the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?
