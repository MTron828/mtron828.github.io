Chapter 834 Unparalleled!

Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled after dozens of simulation trials.

It was very easy to fight ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages now, but it was not enough to insta-kill them.

He wanted to insta-kill ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages. Han Jue stretched lazily and started to check his emails.

Recently, the Chaos seemed to have become lively again. Many of his friends had been attacked, but there was still no sight of the Divine Authority Generals.

After reading the emails, Han Jue asked in his mind, “How long until the Divine Authority General comes to the Heavenly Dao?”

(1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[About two million years.]

It was not long, but it was not short either.

Han Jue thought for a moment and decided to tell his disciples about this, in case they encountered the Divine Authority Generals in advance and were eliminated.

He looked at the Chaos and discovered that his disciples were all rushing towards the Heavenly Dao. The Buddhist World, the Great Dao Tower, and even the entire world were moving. The scene was quite shocking.

He counted with his fingers and deduced that the disciples had agreed to meet.

He smiled and muttered, “It makes me very relieved.”

At the same time, this proved how terrifying the Divine Authority Generals were. Even the disciples who had always liked to be reckless began to return.

Thinking of this, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and tried to curse the Divine Authority Generals to stall for time.

However, his curse could not find them.

It was as if the Divine Authority Generals did not exist in the Chaos. It was useless even if Han Jue recalled their images in his mind.

Han Jue asked in his mind, “Do I have a chance of winning against the Divine Authority Generals now?”

(1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

(No]

So absolute?

Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat.

No!

He had to hurry up and attain the Supreme Realm as soon as possible. Otherwise, he would be unable to defeat the Divine Authority Generals.

There were still two million years. He should be able to break through before the battle unless something happened.

He was afraid that something would happen!

Han Jue observed the Heavenly Dao. After confirming that there was no chaos, he continued cultivating.

“All Fiendcelestials, come to the Grand Primordium Domain quickly!”

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s voice suddenly sounded in Han Jue’s mind and was ignored.

You guys can fight first!

In the Grand Primordium Domain.

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial looked around at the Chaotic Fiendcelestials in the hall and frowned.

A few Fiendcelestials were missing, and Han Jue didn’t come either.

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial had always minded Han Jue. He felt that this fellow was lying about the Devil Ancestor and Han Tuo.

The Foolish Sword Sage also came. Every Chaotic Fiendcelestial had a solemn expression.

They knew what they were about to face!

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial said in a low voice, “Everyone, you should already know what Pangu has done for us. We have nowhere to escape and can only fight! Previously, I didn’t disappear. I only went into seclusion. I already know the Divine Authority Generals’ true goal, so I entered seclusion!

“The Divine Authority Generals are not looking for the Primordial Fiendcelestial, but to eliminate it. If we are slaughtered, the Primordial Fiendcelestial will easily be discovered once it shows its potential. The Primordial Fiendcelestial won’t be able to grow without our providence.

“According to the original Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, the Primordial Fiendcelestial will be like Pangu in the past. It will step on our providence and quickly become stronger. Then, it will cause chaos. The Great Dao Divine Spirits plan to make the Primordial Fiendcelestial unable to become stronger, but we will be the ones sacrificed! Are you willing?” His voice was low and filled with anger.

With that said, all the Chaotic Fiendcelestials spoke one after another, all unwilling.

The Foolish Sword Sage said, “I didn’t expect the Divine Authority Generals to actually want to deal with us. It might be related to our strength. We threaten the Great Dao Divine Spirits’ status and dominance even without the Primordial Fiendcelestial.

“Kill! Why don’t we join forces instead of being eliminated one by one!”

As a Chaotic Fiendcelestial who had survived fighting Pangu alone, the Foolish Sword Sage had a lot of say now.

A Chaotic Fiendcelestial asked, “But can we really stop the Divine Authority Generals alone? I didn’t say that we won’t fight, but there’s still time. We can prepare more.”

In the vast Chaos, the Divine Authority Generals were still monitoring from the depths of the Chaos. They were not directly targeting the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial said, “Pangu can still revive. In addition, he has already gathered the twelve Ancestral Magi to help. Although the Ancestral Magi are not very strong, they are still a force.”

Pangu could revive!

The Chaotic Fiendcelestials trembled!

Pangu’s strength was unquestionable. He had fought dozens of Fiendcelestials alone!

The Chaotic Fiendcelestials suggested one after another. They gathered all the forces they could and prepared to start an unprecedented battle!

The more they spoke, the more excited they became.

They even wanted to rope in the Devil Ancestor!

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial laughed. “Very good, let the Divine Spirits see who’s in charge of the current Chaos!”

Perhaps this battle was not only a life-and-death battle but also a battle that changed the situation of the Chaos!

The Fiendcelestials were not hopeless. After all, some of them had the cultivation of a Great Dao Supreme. They were more than enough to fight dozens of Great Dao Sages alone.

Heavenly Dao.

In the Divine Palace Hall, a quiet hall suddenly shook and the door opened.

Qin Ling slowly walked out. A golden dragon wrapped around his body and the shadow of a huge halberd could be vaguely seen.

He looked up at the sky, his eyes shooting out golden light that pierced through the clouds.

“Buddhist Sect, it’s time to repay the blood debt!”

Qin Ling smiled sinisterly.

At this moment, the geniuses of the Divine Palace rushed over. Although the Divine Palace was a major force, it did not have many Pseudo-Sages. Every new one was worthy of the Divine Palace’s congratulations.

Zhang Guxing also came. He was naturally not in his main body, it was just a Dharma idol.

Qin Ling cupped his hands at him.

Zhang Guxing stopped in front of him and said in a low voice, “Why aren’t you restraining your aura?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qin Ling replied, “I’m declaring war!”

“You… are still stubborn?”

“Sage, please allow me to be stubborn!”

Zhang Guxing trembled in anger when he heard that, but he was relieved inside.

It was finally coming!

It was good to end the calamity as soon as possible. The Heavenly Dao needed to unite its spirit and prepare for the calamity.

At the same time, outside the 33rd Heaven.

In Fang Liang’s Dao Field, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, Ji Xianshen, and Su Qi gathered.

“Is it Qin Ling? Why is there such a huge commotion?” Jiang Yi asked curiously. Qin Ling’s aura had already spread to the 33rd Heaven. To Sages, it was considered an offense.

Fang Liang did not hide anything and told him about the plan of the Immeasurable Calamity.

Zhao Xuanyuan clicked his tongue in wonder. “You guys really know how to play!”

Dao Sovereign thought of the previous Immeasurable Calamity and sighed. “No matter how the Heavenly Dao develops, it’s still a Sage playing chess. Fortunately, we’ve already jumped out of the chessboard. Qin Ling is also taken care of by the Hidden Sect.”

Su Qi nodded in agreement.

He had been played the worst in the previous calamity. He couldn’t help but sigh even now.

Jiang Yi said, “By the way, did Sect Master say anything? We can’t enter the Heavenly Dao now.”

Fang Liang said, “No, but this is the best explanation.”

The others felt that it made sense and nodded.

Han Jue would definitely lead them to escape if he was afraid.

If he did not say anything, that meant that he wanted to fight!
