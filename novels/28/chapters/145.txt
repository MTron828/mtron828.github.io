Chapter 147 Eighth Level of Mahayana Realm, Invasion of True Devils

Twelve years later.

Han Jue broke through to the eighth level of the Mahayana Realm. With pressure, he had motivation. His cultivation speed was even faster than before.

After breaking through, Han Jue habitually took out the Book of Misfortune. He cursed and checked the emails.

(Your good friend Zhou Fan was attacked by a fiendish cultivator] x4729

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by a fiendish cultivator] x110332

(Your disciple Murong Qi was attacked by righteous cultivators] x78

[Your good friend Huang Jihao was attacked by a fiendish cultivator] x74110

(Your good friend Daoist Nine Cauldrons was attacked by a fiendish cultivator] x85

(Your disciple Fang Liang comprehended the Heavenly Dao while cultivating. His cultivation has increased greatly.]

(Your Dao Companion Xuan Qingjun has received a divine providence.)

(Your good friend Du Ku was attacked by a Loose Immortal. His life is hanging by a thread.]

The entire backlog was filled with fiendish cultivators.

But this time, it was not the demonic path that swept through the world. Instead, it was being hunted down like a beaten dog. Han Jue didn’t pity them. He was not a saint.

The righteous and demonic paths were irreconcilable.

When the fiends had swept through the righteous path, many sects had been massacred and many people had been killed by fiendish cultivators.

Perhaps there was some scum in the righteous path, but the demonic path was not slandered either.

As for the righteous and demonic paths joining forces to resist the Heavenly Court, that was too ridiculous and impossible of an idea!

The Heavenly Court had always been on the side of the righteous path, equivalent to the superior of the righteous path. Now, the superior suspected that his subordinates were colluding with the enemy, and in order to survive, his subordinates had to collude with the enemy?

Not to mention, even if the righteous and demonic paths joined forces, they still couldn’t stop Heavenly Court. If they did that, would the righteous path still be the righteous path?

Han Jue didn’t place all his hopes on the righteous path. He still had to become stronger.

If the Heavenly Court insisted on destroying the mortal world, he had to have the ability to protect himself.

At most, he would bring the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain and hide in the netherworld!

Han Jue could still jump to other realms. After all, he had chosen the path of the Sword Immortal of Reincarnation. However, he could only head to another realm by himself and could not bring anyone else with him. Furthermore, he didn’t understand the other realms at all, so he couldn’t choose where to go. In other words, once he used the Reincarnation Mystical Power, the destination would be quite random.

Unless he had no choice, he wouldn’t jump to another realm.

If he jumped into the Devil World, wouldn’t he suffer?

Han Jue silently thought that he still had many ways to survive.

He secretly prayed that the Demon Saint would cause more trouble and not let the Heavenly Court recover in a short time.

After the curse ended, Han Jue continued cultivating

He only had one goal now—to reach the perfected ninth level of the Mahayana Realm as soon as possible!

A year later.

A familiar voice entered Han Jue’s ears: “Fellow Daoist Guan, come out. I won’t challenge you this time.’

Ji Xianshen!

Han Jue frowned. Why was this fellow here again?

Han Jue thought for a moment and decided to go out and meet the guy to prevent him from causing trouble.

It was still that forest. After not seeing him for decades, Ji Xianshen’s aura had more than doubled.

This fellow slaughtered fiendish cultivators everywhere and could still become stronger. It was simply unreasonable.

Han Jue even suspected that he and Huang Jihao had a system that allowed them to level up by killing monsters. Why does my system not have this function?

In certain novels, people could sign in to random locations and become stronger wherever they went. As for Han Jue, he had to cultivate on his own.

Han Jue sighed in his heart.

Ji Xianshen looked at him and said with a burning gaze, “Fellow Daoist Guan, on behalf of the Heavenly Immortal Manor, I invite you to join and become an elder of the manor. Are you willing?”

“Thank you for your kind intentions, I’ll

pass.”

“Why?”

“No location is better than home.”

“Uh…”

Ji Xianshen was stunned by Han Jue’s words. What was he saying?

He continued, “The Heavenly Immortal Manor discovered the barrier set up by the demonic path which is already connected to an unknown world. I’m afraid it’s related to the Devil Race. Previously, we encountered a world created by them, and I even fought my way in. Are you interested in fighting the Devil Race with me? Typically, such a world contains cultivation resources given by the Devil Race to the demonic path. There might be treasures that you need.”

Han Jue asked in surprise, “Is the Devil Race so weak?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Hearing this, Ji Xianshen flew into a rage. “What do you mean?”

“Cough, cough. I’m not belittling your Heavenly Immortal Manor. No matter what, the devils should be stronger than mortals. Otherwise, why would the fiends respect them?”

“The actual Devil Race is trapped in the netherworld, so they can only send some True Devils to preach. The strongest ones we’ve encountered are around the ninth level of the Mahayana Realm.”

“I won’t be going. I wish you all the best.”

Han Jue shook his head. After saying that, he turned around and prepared to leave.

Ji Xianshen pulled him back and asked, “By the way, what does Fang Liang have to do with you? I saw him on the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.”

Han Jue said, “Nothing much, he’s just a guest.”

“That’s good. This lad is extremely talented. He might even be thought to be more talented than me. I’m prepared to recruit him.”

“Oh, I remember now. He’s my grand-disciple.”

Ji Xianshen wanted to curse. No wonder Fang Liang was so absurdly talented!

After living for more than a thousand years, apart from Han Jue, this was the first time that Ji Xianshen felt pressured.

It was not pressure from strength, but talent! Fang Liang had risen too quickly. Even his master had reminded him, hoping that he could help Fang Liang. “Hmph! Goodbye!”

Ji Xianshen waved his sleeve and left.

Han Jue shook his head and returned to the cave abode.

Under the Fusang Tree, the Three-headed Wyrm King frowned.

The others could not sense Ji Xianshen’s aura, but he could.

Very strong!

Such a powerful existence was like a child when facing Han Jue. He was even more curious about Han Jue’s cultivation.

Seven years later.

Amidst cultivating, Han Jue suddenly felt uneasy and opened his eyes.

What happened?

Why did he suddenly feel so uneasy?

Han Jue frowned. Dao Comprehension Sword opened her eyes.

She asked, “Master, do you feel uneasy?” Han Jue wondered, “You feel it, too? What do you sense?”

“I don’t know. It’s just depressing.”

Dao Comprehension Sword’s answer made Han Jue even more uneasy. Is Heavenly Court attacking? So fast?

At this moment, three lines of words appeared in front of Han Jue.

[Detected that the True Devils have invaded the mortal world and a calamity will befall the mortal world. You have the following choices:]

(1: Exit seclusion immediately and kill all the True Devils. Your name will shake the world. You can obtain a Numinous Treasure and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.] [2: Continue cultivating and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Mystical Power inheritance.] True Devils were invading?

Han Jue’s eyebrows twitched. It turned out that the Devil Race had done something.

His first reaction was to contact the Heavenly Puppet and ask Xing Hongxuan, Fairy Xi Xuan, and Chang Yue’er to return to the sect immediately.

It was the first time that the three girls had heard Han Jue so eager for them to return. They immediately put down what they were doing and returned to the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.

Han Jue silently chose the second option.

To be able to cause a calamity, this batch of True Devils had to be very strong. He couldn’t take the risk.

It was fine to make a move, but it would be best if he was confident enough.

Han Jue Immediately checked if there were any True Devils within a hundred miles of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. (Lou Yuxue: Ninth level of the Mahayana Realm, Commander of the True Devils]
