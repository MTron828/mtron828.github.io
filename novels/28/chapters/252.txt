Chapter 253 Trillion Years, Heavenly Devil Mission

[Name: Han Jue]

(Lifespan: 2,677 / 54,112,999,999,999) [Race: Immortal (Stellar Primordial Body)] (Cultivation: Rank One Reincarnation Immortal Emperor] (Technique: Six Paths of Reincarnation (Can be inherited), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]

[Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death]

[Magic: …]

Fifty-four trillion years of lifespan?

Han Jue was stunned.

Something was wrong.

Wasn’t it said that the Immortal Emperor Realm meant eternal life?

Why did he still have a lifespan number?

Han Jue frowned and felt that something was wrong. After thinking for a moment, he took out the Heavenly Dao Token to contact Di Taibai.

“What is it?” Di Taibai sounded a little tired.

“Senior, are Immortal Emperors eternal existences?”

“You can say that. But even Immortal Emperors will die.”

“Has an Immortal Emperor lived for a trillion

years?”

“A trillion years? Perhaps. It’s too long. I won’t live that long, anyway.”

Han Jue frowned. That made sense.

How many people could live for so long?

Not to mention trillions of years, even a hundred million years was long enough.

The Divine General was probably only a few million years old, but he was already capable of stirring up trouble. How powerful was an existence who had lived for trillions of years? When Han Jue reached the Deity Realm, his lifespan would continue to increase. It was unimaginable.

Han Jue had the system to quantify the concept of immortality.

If Immortal Emperors were immortal, why would they fight? How many ancient existences were secretly spying on them now?

After Han Jue figured it out, he stopped thinking about it.

The two of them exchanged a few pleasantries and hung up.

In short, it was very difficult for him to die now. As for his lifespan, it was too far away. It was so far away that even the world might not last that long.

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone and started to fuse the two together to increase the book’s realm.

Several days later.

[Your Book of Misfortune has been upgraded to an Emperor Dao Supreme Treasure.] Han Jue smiled in satisfaction when he saw this line.

He immediately started cursing, starting from the Victorious Fighting Buddha.

As he cursed, he checked his emails. The Victorious Fighting Buddha had yet to arrive. It looked like he had been stopped by the Heavenly Court.

(Your good friend Jiang Yi was attacked by an Immortal Emperor and was severely injured.]

(Your good friend Divine General was attacked by an Immortal Emperor and was severely injured.)

(Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has comprehended the Heavenly Emperor’s statue. His providence has increased greatly.]

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by evil ghosts] X37211

(Your good friend Long Shan has reconstructed his body.]

(Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck. The providence of the Divine Palace is not affected.]

(Your good friend Zhou Fan encountered a fortuitous encounter and learned a Mystical Power.]

Along the way, he couldn’t see the word “mighty’ anymore. They were all Immortal Emperors. The Victorious Fighting Buddha was really impressive. Even the Divine General and Jiang Yi couldn’t stop him.

Han Jue was nervous. He had just stepped into the Emperor Realm and definitely couldn’t defeat the Victorious Fighting Buddha.

He could only curse and stall for time. Han Jue thought silently.

Half a year later, he began to improve his Sword Dao Mystical Powers, raising all of them to the limit.

After making all the preparations, Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

It was time for the exam. It was time to test the results! Han Jue’s gaze became sharp, and he started the simulation trial.

White-Robed Buddha, insta-kill!

Marshal Shen Peng, insta-kill!

Jiang Yi, insta-kill!

Against the Heavenly Emperor, Han Jue was insta-killed!

All others were insta-killed!

After sweeping through all of them, Han Jue suddenly felt bored.

The only Immortal Emperor he had copied was Jiang Yi. Although Marshal Shen Peng had reached the Emperor Realm, that was after they had met.

As for the Heavenly Emperor, he was most likely at the Deity Realm.

Han Jue couldn’t win!

After exhaling, he stood up and walked out of the Connate Cave Abode.

The disciples surrounded him the moment they saw him.

“Master, you broke through?”

“Grandmaster, how strong are you now?”

“Have you comprehended a Mystical Power or broken through?”

“You’re finally out!” Facing the excited crowd, Han Jue smiled and said, “Alright, stop asking. I’m in a good mood today, so I’ll preach the Dao to you.” Everyone was pleasantly surprised. They missed Han Jue too much!

Huang Zuntian sat at the back and waited expectantly. Ever since he came to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain, he was increasingly convinced that his decision was correct.

Look at how strong these Hidden Sect disciples were!

He felt that without Han Jue’s help, just these disciples were enough to overturn the entire mortal world.

“I have to grasp the opportunity!” Huang Zuntian thought firmly.

In the endless void, a wise and mighty man sat on a lotus throne that shone with golden light.

This person wore golden armor and a kasaya. He had a handsome face and a burly figure. The huge staff behind him was like a heavenly pillar that was tens of thousands of feet tall.

It was the Victorious Fighting Buddha!

The Victorious Fighting Buddha slowly opened his eyes. With a solemn expression, he said in a low voice, “Come out!”

In an instant, beams of light appeared in all directions, for a total of 24 beams.

“Victorious Fighting Buddha, how dare you invade the Heavenly Court. You’re courting death!”

“Hmph, do you really think you can sweep through the Heavenly Court alone?”

“Today is the day you die!”

“Victorious Fighting Buddha, hurry up and be executed!”

Voices followed, loud and domineering.

The Victorious Fighting Buddha swept his gaze around and smiled disdainfully. “I thought that it was really the arrival of the 24 Star Lords. In the end, it’s only the second generation. Do you think you can kill me? Even if another hundred come, it still won’t do!”

He felt disdain towards everything!

The Victorious Fighting Buddha stood up and roared. He was like a ferocious beast, violent and savage! The figures of immortals quickly flew out from the 24 beams of light. A huge battle erupted again!

Two years later.

Han Jue returned to the Connate Cave Abode, and Dao Comprehension Sword followed.

Sitting on the bed, Han Jue sent his consciousness into the depths of his soul and met the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil.

After a long period of imprisonment, Han Jue’s Six Paths Insignia had already entered the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil’s body. He could kill it with a thought.

He could control the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil’s life and death.

“Do you still want to live?” Han Jue asked.

The sleeping Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil was immediately awakened. He hurriedly shouted, “Yes! I want to! I can do anything you want me to!”

He finally understood. Han Jue definitely had a motive for killing him!

“Can you return to the Chaotic Forbidden Zone and infiltrate the Buddhist Sect in the future?” Han Jue asked.

The Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil gritted his teeth. “Sure. What do you want me to do?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Han Jue said, “Just hide in the Buddhist Sect. If possible, you can also think of a way to become a Buddha and try your best to climb your way up to power. I don’t need you to do anything for me. If the Buddhist Sect becomes my enemy in the future, you have to be useful. If the Buddhist Sect doesn’t disturb me, we will be strangers.”

The Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil was pleasantly surprised.

That’s it?

“I agree!”

The Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil quickly agreed.

Han Jue immediately released him.

Dao Comprehension Sword saw a black shadow flying out from above Han Jue’s head, then black shadow said respectfully, “Thank you for not killing me, Senior!”

With that, the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil quickly left.

Dao Comprehension Sword asked curiously, “Master, what was that just now?”

Han Jue replied, “Just pretend you didn’t see?it.”

Then, he began to test the experts near the Reroll World.
