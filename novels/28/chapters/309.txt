Chapter 312 All Becoming Immortal Emperors, Peak of the Sword Dao

The Immortal Talent Meeting was spectacular and could even be recorded in history. This would be the beginning of a new era.

Han Jue didn’t participate in this event. He wasn’t interested.

His life was only about cultivation.

Time flew.

Fifty years passed.

Han Jue’s cultivation level had been steadily increasing. He was no longer far from becoming a Rank Five Immortal Emperor.

The new inner sect competition of the Hidden Sect had already ended. Han Jue, the Black Hell Demon Lord, White-Robed Buddha, and Duan Hongchen did not participate. First place was Tu Ling’er; the Ancestral Magus Tower was too strong, the other disciples couldn’t break through its defensive restrictions.

Next was Murong Qi and then Li Yao.

Han Jue didn’t care about the rankings of the others. He only wanted to remember the top three.

It was worth mentioning that Chu Shiren’s ranking was actually quietly increasing. This fellow finally had his Dao heart stirred by the constant competition. He was no longer a slacker and also began to cultivate his Mystical Power.

Everyone was very happy about this. This way, they wouldn’t be afraid of being annoyed by Chu Shiren.

Only Zhou Mingyue felt bitter. He would be suppressed by his master in the future.

On this day, Han Jue stopped cultivating and took out the Book of Misfortune to do his daily missions.

While cursing, he checked his emails.

(Your grand-disciple Fang Liang was attacked by Jie School cultivators) x1342 (Your disciple Long Hao has comprehended the Great Dao. His cultivation has increased greatly.)

(Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by a Divine Palace mighty figure) x18

(Your good friend Sword God Emperor was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong and was severely injured. Fortunately, a mighty figure saved him.] [Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked by Jie School cultivators] x47

(Your good friend Han Ming was cursed by a mysterious curse.]

[Your Dao Companion Xuan Qingjun comprehended the true meaning of heaven and earth and comprehended a Mystical Power. Her providence has increased.]

The Jie School had begun to become active?

Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

He didn’t have a good impression of the Jie School. After all, he had been threatened by their disciples.

I wonder how Huang Zuntian is doing there? Han Jue thought silently.

He was still worried about Huang Zuntian. He was very strong in the mortal world, but not in the Immortal World.

Xuan Qingjun was also in the Jie School, but it seemed that she was doing well. She was rarely attacked, and she had been cultivating diligently. Han Jue continued to read the emails. At most, he would complain in his mind. The content of the emails wouldn’t affect his life.

He had to persevere and cultivate in a low-profile manner until he was invincible.

He wasn’t even 4,000 years old, but he was already a Rank Four Immortal Emperor. Such speed was definitely the number one in the myriad worlds. This meant that he had taken the right path in the first half of his life. He had to carry it out.

He couldn’t even remember how many friends had died along the way.

The path of cultivation was already filled with difficulties. There was a high chance of death.

One of the reasons Han Jue liked to read emails was to warn himself. Because every time he read them, he would see someone getting beaten up.

A month later.

Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and called Dao Comprehension Sword in.

“Have you mastered the third level of the Heavenly Sword Dao?” Han Jue asked.

Dao Comprehension Sword nodded, then shook her head. “I feel like I have, but I also feel like I’m missing something.”

The third level of the Heavenly Sword Dao was “Sword Creates the Primordial World”.

Dao Comprehension Sword could create a worldly illusion with a single strike, but this world was not strong. It couldn’t bury the enemy.

Every time she used this move in the simulation trial, it was useless.

Han Jue patted the bed beside him and said, “Come here.”

Dao Comprehension Sword obediently walked over.

The two of them sat on the bed.

Han Jue raised his hand and pointed his index finger at Dao Comprehension Sword’s forehead, conveying his imagination of the Primordial World to her.

Dao Comprehension Sword had too little knowledge and limited imagination. It couldn’t be helped. Han Jue wouldn’t let her go out to train, after all.

His disciples were looking forward to the next calamity. After enduring this Immeasurable Calamity, by the next one, all the disciples of the Hidden Sect would definitely be Immortal Emperors!

Of course, Han Jue hadn’t revealed this goal to them yet, so as to avoid giving them pressure.

The mountains and rivers were continuous, and the sky was high without clouds.

Two figures stood at the peak of a mountain. They were Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao.

There was a terrifying figure guarding the surroundings. With a glance, there were only a few tens of thousands of figures. All of them emitted a terrifying aura that shook the world and swayed like flames.

Li Daokong smiled. “Junior Brother, can you still hold on?”

Compared to Li Daokong, who looked like he had never fought, Li Xuan’ao’s clothes were torn and his hair was slightly messy.

Li Xuan’ao snorted. “You didn’t fall. How can I not be able to hold on?”

He immediately prepared to fly into the sky to fight, but Li Daokong stopped him. Li Xuan’ao looked at him suspiciously.

Li Daokong smiled and said, “You can stop now. Didn’t you want to see my true strength?”

Li Xuan’ao frowned impatiently.

He knew that his senior was about to start posturing again.

Clang

Li Daokong pulled out the sword at his waist. In an instant, sword light illuminated the world.

He held his sword in one hand and pointed it at the sky. As his gaze landed on the tip of the sword, his smile gradually turned arrogant.

“Watch carefully. This is the strongest sword of the Human School!

“With this strike, all will die!”

Li Daokong laughed impudently. His robes fluttered as his aura continued to increase. The entire mountain began to tremble as countless rocks rolled down.

Li Xuan’ao looked at his senior in surprise. As if thinking of something, his expression changed drastically.

“Could it be…

“Impossible!”

Li Xuan’ao widened his eyes as he stared at him. Beads of cold sweat broke out on his forehead.

In the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue opened his eyes. Dao Comprehension Sword was still in the Primordial World that he had created.

Han Jue looked up and saw the sky of the netherworld. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The dark clouds in the sky surged violently as if a storm was about to arrive.

“Master, not good. The Sword Dao River is surging. It seems to be collapsing!”

Liu Bei’s voice sounded in his mind, his tone anxious.

Han Jue frowned. He immediately jumped into the Sword Dao River.

The once calm Sword Dao River twisted violently. The advancing sword cultivators became blurry and flashed.

Han Jue clearly felt an extremely terrifying pressure enveloping the Sword Dao River. “Someone is using a Mystical Power?”

Han Jue’s expression changed slightly. Somehow, he could feel the terror of that Sword Dao Mystical Power. It was stronger than all the Mystical Powers he had encountered before.

For some reason, Han Jue suddenly thought of the figure walking at the end of the Sword Dao River when he raised his Sword Dao Mystical Powers.

Han Jue gritted his teeth and said, “Leave the Sword Dao River with me first.”

The Sword Dao River could collapse at any time. They would definitely be severely injured if they stayed here.

Liu Bei nodded in relief.

The two of them immediately vanished from the Sword Dao River.

They came to the void.

Liu Bei asked nervously, “Master, could that be someone using some kind of Sword Dao Mystical Power?”

Han Jue nodded. “Probably. The other party’s cultivation is ridiculously high.”

Who was it?

He had such a cultivation level!

To be able to force him to use a Mystical Power, his opponent must be very strong. Han Jue suddenly felt that the Immortal Emperor Realm was too weak.

As he sighed, three lines of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
