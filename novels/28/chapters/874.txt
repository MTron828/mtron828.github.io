Chapter 876 Returning to His Home, Legend of the Immortal

“Father, how old is Han Xinyuan?”

“Father, where is my brother?”

“Father, I want to find my brother!”

“Father—”

Han Jue was annoyed. He really wanted to throw this girl down.

Qingluan’er saw through him and smiled. “Your father will throw you down if you continue to cause trouble.”

Han Qing’er smiled proudly. “I’m not afraid. I can fly.”

Han Jue glared at her and didn’t mention Han Tuo. Han Qing’er was so angry that her eyes turned red.

After that, Han Jue brought his wife and daughter to the Immortal World.

Ten years passed in the blink of an eye.

Han Qing’er had already grown into a young girl. She wore a beautiful red dress and her long hair was tied behind her head. She was in high spirits as she walked with Qingluan’er. They looked like sisters instead of mother and daughter.

Han Jue stood in front of the two women and looked at the sky.

“Father, where are we going next?” Han Qing’er asked, her eyes filled with anticipation.

Ever since she was young, she had been very happy and had no worries. She could see new things every day and didn’t need to spend any energy on traveling. It was very easy.

Han Jue said, “To the mortal world. This is the last time. After that, you should leave the Immortal World and go home. It will be difficult for you to come out in the future. You have to cultivate well.”

Han Qing’er curled her lips and said, “So be it. I’m so talented. I’ll surprise you when the time comes.”

Over the years, Han Qing’er had also understood the cultivation situation in the Immortal World. After comparing, she discovered that she was extremely talented, so she also had expectations for cultivation.

Qingluan’er smiled and said, “Qing’er’s potential is indeed not bad. Back then, your brother didn’t have your talent, but he still resolutely left alone to seek Immortal encounters even if his potential was mediocre.”

At the mention of Han Tuo, Han Qing’er became interested and asked, “Mother, what’s my brother’s cultivation level now? Didn’t you say that he lived for five million years? Is he a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal?”

In the Immortal World, many living beings had lived for five million years but could not break through to the Deity Realm. Her mother was also only at this realm. She thought that Han Tuo was stronger because she had always been looking forward to seeing the brother she had never met, and she even worshiped him.

Qingluan’er shook her head and laughed. She glanced at Han Jue and, seeing that he didn’t want to say it, could only say, “Perhaps.”

Han Jue had instructed that Han Qing’er could not know the realm above the Sage Realm to prevent laziness.

Qingluan’er could understand this.

At least after she knew that Han Jue had surpassed the Freedom Realm, she felt that it didn’t matter if she cultivated or not. In any case, she couldn’t catch up to him.

She wouldn’t be in danger or cause trouble for Han Jue as long as she stayed by his side.

Han Qing’er curled her lips and said, “If we can’t see Big Brother, then we’ll see Second Brother. Father, can we visit Second Brother before we go home? He might already be born.”

Han Jue didn’t even turn around. “Of course, I have to go back and take a look, but your second brother is still not born.”

“Why isn’t he born yet? Could it be that Eldest Mother is not human but a demon?”

“Of course not. It’s just that your second brother is too talented.”

“Too talented?”

Han Qing’er’s eyes lit up.

Han Jue snorted. “Stop asking.”

He waved his right sleeve, and the three of them arrived at the Reroll World.

Below were the eighteen peaks of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect, but the landscape had long changed.

Han Qing’er asked curiously, “What is this place? Why is there no one here?”

Qingluan’er also looked at him in confusion.

Han Jue said, “This is the place where I was born.”

Hearing this, Qingluan’er and Han Qing’er became interested.

The three of them landed on the ground. Han Jue walked in front and his thoughts returned to five million years ago.

.

Qingluan’er and Han Qing’er looked around and didn’t disturb him.

Han Jue came to a cliff and looked at the mountains. The glorious appearance of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect in the past appeared in front of him. Endless disciples ran rampant in the mountains. Han Jue thought of Elder Iron, Li Qingzi, and Daoist Nine Cauldrons.

Everything had become the past. His old friends had long reincarnated.

“Father, there’s someone on the opposite mountain!” Han Qing’er suddenly pointed ahead and exclaimed.

Following her gaze, he saw someone cutting trees in the forest opposite.

There was no one in a radius of ten thousand miles. It was indeed strange for a woodcutter to appear here, but this didn’t attract Han Jue’s attention.

Han Qing’er rolled her eyes and leaped into the forest opposite.

Qingluan’er did not stop him. That woodcutter did not have any cultivation. Even a bad person couldn’t hurt his daughter.

Han Qing’er landed behind the woodcutter and snorted. The woodcutter trembled in fear. He turned around and staggered, falling to the ground. The axe slipped out of his hand and accidentally cut his palm. Blood instantly flowed out.

The woodcutter frowned in pain.

Han Qing’er panicked. “Sorry...”

She noticed that the woodcutter was also young. He looked to be in his early twenties.

The woodcutter picked up the axe and asked warily, “Who are you? A demon?”

She was so beautiful and wore a red robe. She was definitely a demoness!

The woodcutter’s face turned pale and he broke out in cold sweat.

Demons ate humans!

Han Qing’er curled her lips. “I’m not a demon. I’m a fairy!”

She waved her right hand, and the wound in the woodcutter’s palm instantly healed.

The woodcutter stood up and ran away.

Han Qing’er raised her hand and waved, using her spirit energy to move him back.

“Why are you running? I’m really not a demon. I came to ask you why you’re the only one nearby?” Han Qing’er said angrily.

The woodcutter said with a trembling voice, “I live nearby. There’s indeed no one else around here.”

Han Qing’er asked in surprise, “You’re so timid, but you still dare to stay here alone?”

The woodcutter gritted his teeth and did not answer.

He began to think of a way to escape.

“Why are you here?” Han Qing’er asked.

She added, “I won’t make things difficult for you if you answer truthfully. I can even teach you cultivation techniques.”

The woodcutter’s eyes lit up.

He hurriedly said, “It’s said that there are inheritances left behind by immortals in this area. Every thousand years, someone will obtain an immortal’s cultivation technique from here and become famous. I just wanted to try. I’ve been here for more than half a year and haven’t found anything.”

“Then, why are you cutting trees?”

“I have to start a fire. There are many beasts at night. I’ll die without a fire.”

“Oh.”

This was the first time Han Qing’er had seen a true mortal. She was filled with interest and began to ask all sorts of questions.

The woodcutter told her everything he knew.

Han Qing’er also learned of his background.

The woodcutter’s village was slaughtered by fiendish cultivators and all of them were refined into dried corpse puppets. He was lucky to escape. He had always wanted revenge and had been searching for immortal encounters since he was ten years old. However, he did not have any cultivation potential and the various sects did not accept him. He could only pursue the illusory legends of immortals.

Han Qing’er couldn’t bear it when she heard this. Just thinking about it from the woodcutter’s point of view, she felt despair.

“How about I help you take revenge?” Han Qing’er asked.

The woodcutter’s eyes lit up. However, he immediately shook his head and said, “No, I want to take revenge personally. Please teach me the cultivation technique.”

Han Qing’er looked helpless and spread her hands. “Actually, I don’t know any cultivation techniques, but I can ask my father.”

After living for so long, she had never cultivated seriously. She relied on her talent.

The woodcutter immediately knelt and kowtowed. “Thank you, Fairy! As long as your father is willing to teach me the cultivation technique, I’m willing to be your slave and serve you forever!”
