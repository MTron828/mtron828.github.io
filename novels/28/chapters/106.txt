Chapter 108: Slaying the Demon Saint!

Upon hearing Great Sage Green Python’s words, everyone in the Jade Pure Sect, from the Sect Master to the outer sect disciples, were all shocked.

The demon wanted to eat all of them!

Inside the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue also heard what Great Sage Green Python said.

He raised an eyebrow.

So arrogant!

He did not seem to be affected by the Book of Misfortune…

Is he so strong?

Han Jue immediately used the simulation trial to search for the demon.

However, there was no Great Sage Green Python within a hundred miles. He had yet to arrive and was already posturing.

Helpless, Han Jue immediately shifted Yang Tiandong into the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain to prevent him from being captured by the demon and used as a hostage.

Of course, if that was the case, Han Jue would not be merciful.

In any case, he had already imprinted the Six Paths Insignia on Yang Tiandong. It was fine even if he died. They could continue their relationship as master and disciple in the next life!

Han Jue slowly stood up. The Numinous Treasures on his body shone faintly.

Heaven and Earth Grass shivered and said, “Master, where are you going? Don’t leave me behind!”

Without looking back, Han Jue said, “I’ll be back soon.”

He walked out of the cave abode. The Black Hell Chicken, Xun Chang’an, Yang Tiandong, and Murong Qi waited anxiously under the Fusang Tree.

Great Sage Green Python’s terrifying demonic aura had already enveloped the sect. Not only his demonic aura, but the demonic auras of other demons could also be felt. The demonic aura gathered together and surged like a wave from all directions, threatening to drown the Jade Pure Sect.

Xiao Yao, Guan Yougang, Liu Bumie, Li Qingzi, Fairy Xi Xuan, and the others floated high in the sky. From their point of view, the world was filled with black clouds formed by demonic aura, oppressive and terrifying.

Cold sweat broke out on the elders’ foreheads.

“Just how powerful is this Great Sage Green Python?”

“Who is he referring to?”

“I can’t take it. Where’s Deity Slaying Elder?”

“Elder Xiao, Elder Liu, can you defeat this great demon?”

“How many demons are there in Great Sage Green Python’s army?”

“Has the sect protection formation been activated?”

…

While the elders were alarmed, the disciples were even more terrified.

Xing Hongxuan walked out of the cave abode and came to Han Jue’s side. She asked nervously, “Husband, what are you going to do?”

She often heard Han Jue say that if he met an enemy he couldn’t defeat, he would run away.

Xing Hongxuan didn’t dislike him running away. She was afraid that Han Jue would leave her behind and run away alone.

Han Jue looked into the distance and said softly, “Let’s wait a while more.”

Seeing that he was so calm, Xing Hongxuan, the Black Hell Chicken, Xun Chang’an, and Murong Qi felt relieved.

Yang Tiandong looked at Han Jue in disbelief.

Is Master so powerful that he doesn’t fear the Great Sage Green Python?

He understood Han Jue. If he didn’t have absolute confidence, he wouldn’t be so calm.

Little did they know that Han Jue was frantically using the simulation trial to search for the strongest person in the sect.

Why isn’t he here yet?

Han Jue felt like he was playing an online game. He kept refreshing to try and spawn the Boss.

After a while…

[Great Sage Green Python: First level of the Tribulation Transcendence Realm. A newly advanced Demon Saint.]

Han Jue immediately started the simulation trial.

Two breaths later, he frowned and closed his eyes again.

A breath later, he opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief.

Thank goodness!

Fortunately, he had improved his Three Pure World Cleansing, or else he wouldn’t have been able to break through the golden wooden staff’s defense.

Han Jue opened his right hand and maintained the posture of holding the sword. The reason why he didn’t take out the Primordial Judgment Sword was that he wanted to catch the Demon Saint off guard!

He walked to the edge of the cliff and gazed into the horizon.

Great Sage Green Python was flying towards the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain. It was not because he had guessed that there would be a formidable opponent on the mountain, but because he was coming for Yang Tiandong!

Yang Tiandong could clearly sense Great Sage Green Python’s killing intent. His head was covered in a cold sweat and his entire body was trembling in fear.

Han Jue didn’t care about him and continued to look at the sky.

In next to no time, the figure of the Great Sage Green Python appeared. The 300-meter tall figure walked over while standing on a black cloud of demonic qi, carrying a golden wooden staff on his shoulder. He seemed as if he was from the primeval times, and his entire body emanated an overbearing and terrifying aura.

Behind him were countless demons in the churning demon clouds, each more ferocious than the last. They looked at the Jade Pure Sect as if they were looking at a buffet.

“The scent of a cultivator is so fragrant!”

“Don’t snatch my food today. I’m starving!”

“All you know is to eat. Humans are not just edible, especially their women!”

“There are too few people. There’s not enough for us to share!”

“Listen to the Demon Saint’s orders. We can’t act without orders!”

…

Great Sage Green Python had already noticed Yang Tiandong. A sinister smile appeared on his face.

“Not running this time?” The Great Sage Green Python’s laughter sounded again, causing everyone in the sect to tense up. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yang Tiandong didn’t dare to look at him and could only turn to look at Han Jue.

Han Jue’s expression was calm.

He was considering when to attack.

He wanted to catch the Great Sage Green Python off guard!

Great Sage Green Python noticed Han Jue. His cultivation level was too low.

He then glanced at the Black Hell Chicken. This chicken’s cultivation level was not bad. He could tame it.

Immediately after, his gaze landed on the Fusang Tree.

Huh!

This tree!

As if thinking of something, Great Sage Green Python’s eyes widened.

“How is this possible! Why is this divine tree here?”

Great Sage Green Python was shocked. Immediately, a strong desire arose in his heart.

He wanted this tree!

His spiritual sense had already swept across the Jade Pure Sect. The strongest was only at the ninth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm. He couldn’t even withstand a single strike from him!

Great Sage Green Python noticed the Jade Pure Sect cultivators and laughed. “I’ll let you experience my power!”

He leaped up as a violent pressure descended from the sky. The eighteen peaks, the main peak, and the nearby mountains shook.

Great Sage Green Python swooped down, aiming for the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.

Everyone in the sect was extremely nervous. They all knew who was hiding in the Immortal Mountain.

If even that person could not stop the demon, they could only wait for death!

Li Qingzi’s hands were clenched tightly in his sleeves, and beads of cold sweat formed on his forehead.

Fairy Xi Xuan frowned and her body trembled slightly.

All the elders were extremely nervous. This was not the first time they had relied on Deity Slaying Elder, but this time, the situation was different.

The nearby states had already fallen. Such a calamity was unprecedented, at least not in the history they knew!

Time passed very slowly. It was as if a slow-motion button had been pressed. Everyone stared at Great Sage Green Python, unable to hear anything else.

The world fell silent!

Under their gazes, countless sword shadows suddenly shot out from the immortal mountain. They were densely packed, like a school of carps crossing the river. They soared into the sky, unstoppable!

With a deafening boom, the black sword beam illuminated the world!

Great Sage Green Python was drowned by the sword shadows!

Three Pure World Cleansing!

Han Jue made his move!

Standing at the edge of the cliff, he maintained the posture of brandishing the Primordial Judgment Sword. The sword pointed to the sky, the Golden Cicada’s Mystic Divine Robe fluttered, and the Earth Emperor’s Soul Ward swayed wildly in the wind!

The Black Hell Chicken, Xun Chang’an, Murong Qi, Yang Tiandong, and Xing Hongxuan all widened their eyes and looked at Han Jue’s back in shock.

From behind, Han Jue looked like an immortal. He was so majestic and awe-inspiring!

“I was going to do this,” Han Jue said softly in response to the previous question. His eyes were calm and his face was expressionless.

Xing Hongxuan heard the answer she didn’t get before. Although Han Jue’s words were light, they were filled with power and struck her heart hard.

These words were etched in her mind!
