Chapter 306 Heavenly God General Declares War, Providence of the War God

“However!”

The black shadow changed his tone. Han Ming looked up at him expectantly.

“The Chan School is preparing to hold an Immortal Talent Meeting in Kunlun. All the immortals below a million years old can participate. You can go and try. Whatever fortuitous encounter you can obtain will be up to you. However, you have to return after the meeting ends. Otherwise, our ties as master and disciple will be severed.”

Han Ming was pleasantly surprised and quickly thanked him.

He had been here for more than three thousand years, ever since his mind was fully developed. He had never been anywhere else, not even to see his parents.

He had been waiting for a chance to go out! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I won’t let Master down!” Han Ming promised excitedly.

The black shadow nodded slightly and prepared to leave.

Han Ming hurriedly asked, “Will my brother

go?”

The black shadow said meaningfully, “He won’t go. Don’t think about him all day. The difference between the two of you is too great. Even if you want to acknowledge him as your elder brother now, he won’t acknowledge you. He doesn’t even know of your existence. You’re both children abandoned by your parents. At least, you still have me to take care of you. He has always been alone. His heart can’t contain family anymore. What you have to do is cultivate well and strive to be on par with him one day.”

With that, the black shadow dissipated on the

arena.

Han Ming frowned and clenched his fists.

Ten years later.

Han Jue ended his cultivation and took out the Book of Misfortune to curse the enemy while checking his emails.

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen has left the netherworld.)

(Your good friend Huang Jihao was attacked by disciples of the Jie School] x59308

[Your grand-disciple Fang Liang was attacked by demons] X243376

(Your Dao Companion Xuan Qingjun has entered the Jie School’s Mystic Realm.]

(Your good friend Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil was attacked by your enemy Heavenly Dao Buddha.]

[Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by your enemy Demon Emperor.]

(Your good friend Divine General has reconstructed his body and comprehended the Heavenly Dao. His cultivation has increased greatly.]

The Heavenly Court fought with the Demon Court again!

There was really no end to it.

Among the disciples of the Hidden Sect, only Fang Liang was still wandering in the Heavenly Court. Han Jue couldn’t call him back now as it would seem as if he wanted to abandon the Heavenly Court.

Han Jue looked down and didn’t see anything major for the time being. The Immeasurable Calamity might last for ten thousand years. It would be very difficult for the Heavenly Court and the Demon Court to enter a battle to the death within a few hundred years.

All the forces grew while fighting and used the name of the battle to devour the other small forces.

Just like the Demon Court, they had fought all the way to the netherworld.

Just as Han Jue was reading the emails, an angry shout suddenly sounded like a bolt from the blue.

“I’m the Heavenly God General of the Heavenly Court. I want to seize the title of the number one War God in the Immortal World. I will guard the Heavenly River. Anyone who is not convinced can challenge me. If you defeat me, you will obtain all my Dharmic powers, Dharma treasures, and the great providence of the Heavenly Dao!

“Under the judgment of the Heavenly Dao, if no one can defeat me in a thousand years, I will be the strongest War God in the world!”

This voice was extremely domineering and shocking. Even Han Jue was shocked. A terrifying boom erupted!

Han Jue suddenly looked up, his gaze piercing through Hidden Sect Island and seeing the sky of the netherworld.

What did he see?

He actually saw the sky being pierced by a huge spear tip. In front of this spear tip, everything in the netherworld seemed tiny.

It was larger than anything Han Jue had ever seen!

Just the tip of the spear was already so huge. How terrifying was this spear?

Han Jue was shocked, and so were all the Hidden Sect disciples. “What’s that?”

“That’s the Heavenly God General’s divine weapon!”

“This arrogant Heavenly God General!”

“He does have the right to be arrogant. The Immortal World is going to be lively now.”

“Is he out of his mind to attract hatred towards Heavenly Court?”

“No, it’s the Immeasurable Calamity now. The Heavenly Dao can be summoned. He already said to let the Heavenly Dao witness this. If no one defeats him in a thousand years, he will obtain the providence of the War God. In the myriad worlds, the providence of all existences who call themselves the War God or have the title of War God will go to him!”

The Black Hell Demon Lord also joined the discussion and analyzed the reason for the Heavenly God General’s actions.

Everyone looked at Murong Qi.

Murong Qi was also known as the War God.

The Heavenly God General’s actions would undoubtedly threaten him.

Murong Qi smiled helplessly. “Don’t look at me. At most, I’ll give up the providence of the War God. I can’t be considered a War God in this life, anyway. Tsk tsk, the Heavenly God General is deliberately targeting the Divine Palace. They have many War Gods.” Su Qi asked in surprise, “Aren’t the Heavenly Court and the Divine Palace allies?”

After returning with Murong Qi, he had been in seclusion most of the time and was rarely disturbed like today.

“The relationship between the four overlords of the Immortal World is always changing. You can’t believe them.” The Black Hell Demon Lord shook his head.

Li Yao asked curiously, “If the Heavenly God General gambles on the providence of the War God, can others also gamble on other providence? For example, directly gambling on the word ‘Immortal’. Can he seize the providence of all living beings in the Immortal World like that?”

Everyone looked at her. This woman usually kept a low profile. They didn’t expect her to be so daring

The Black Hell Demon Lord rolled his eyes and said angrily, “Who dares? Even the Heavenly Emperor and the Demon Emperor don’t dare to. Whoever dares to do this is courting death.”

Li Yao smiled in embarrassment. Indeed, she had not considered this deeply enough.

Duan Hongchen stood behind and rubbed his chin in deep thought.

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

Han Jue also eavesdropped on the Black Hell Demon Lord’s explanation. He was secretly anxious.

The Heavenly Court was courting death!

The hunter would shoot the bird that stuck out. It was no wonder they would be defeated in the Immeasurable Calamity!

Oh Heavenly Emperor, how can I save you?

Han Jue had no choice but to take out the Heavenly Dao Token and contact Di Taibai.

Soon, his divine sense connected.

“You’re also here to ask about the Heavenly God General?” Di Taibai asked with a smile. It seemed that more than one person was looking for him.

Han Jue said, “Yes, isn’t this too much arrogance?”

“Don’t worry. The Heavenly Court and the Buddhist Sect have already completely formed an alliance and are in charge of the Divine Investiture Board. Previously, the Demon Court attacked the Heavenly Court and the Divine Palace ignored them despite being an ally. It’s just nice to start with them and fight the Demon Court again.”

“Can the Buddhist Sect be trusted?”

“The Heavenly Dao Buddha personally came to talk to His Majesty. This matter has already been announced to the Immortal World. If the Buddhist Sect reneges, who would dare to believe in them in the future?”

“Fine.”

Han Jue frowned even harder.

He felt uneasy after putting down the Heavenly Dao Token.

The Heavenly Dao Buddha really knew how to scheme.

At this moment, Han Jue began to hesitate, not knowing if he should curse the Heavenly Dao Buddha.

If he cursed him to death and the Buddhist Sect fell into chaos, would the Heavenly Court suffer as well?

Strange. Why would the Heavenly Dao Buddha dare to ally with the Heavenly Court at all costs?

Wait!

Could it be that the Dark Forbidden Lord didn’t curse the Heavenly Court, so the Heavenly Dao Buddha dared to do this?

Right.

He almost forgot.

What if someone followed the traces in the Heavenly Court and found him?

Han Jue immediately took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the Heavenly Emperor.

He was only pretending now, it did not mean that he was enemies with him. He would curse for just one day. After this act, he would not do it again.

Han Jue apologized silently.

Oh Heavenly Emperor, don’t panic. I’m just acting. I won’t curse you until something goes wrong.

Heavenly Court!

In the Numinous Palace, the gods and immortals gathered.

The Heavenly Emperor suddenly frowned and circulated his energy to resist the mysterious curse.

Di Taibai noticed the change in his expression and asked in surprise, “Your Majesty, what’s wrong?”

The immortals also looked at him

Anger flashed in the Heavenly Emperor’s eyes as he said in a low voice, “Someone is cursing me. I’ve deduced a book. It should be the Dark Forbidden Lord!”
