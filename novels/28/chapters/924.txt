Chapter 927 Uncatchable, Unpredictable

“Brother, why do you say that? We’ve suffered together for a million years and can already entrust our lives to each other. We’ll follow you if you want to help the Heavenly Dao!” one of the Divine Punishers said seriously, and the other two echoed.

Among the Five Great Divine Punishers, Han Tuo and Yi Tian were the most famous, but the other three were not jealous. This was because every time they encountered a life and death crisis, Yi Tian and Han Tuo would try their best to save them, even if they might lose themselves. Their brotherhood was already indestructible.

Yi Tian cursed. “What are you waiting for? We’re all brothers. Why are you still playing such tricks? The three of you, listen up. Follow me to guard the Heavenly Dao and fight the Dao Devils. What Ancestor Tian Xu? What Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit? Won’t his reputation increase if he’s killed by the five of us?”

The three Divine Punishers smiled and shouted. They weren’t afraid of anything.

Han Tuo smiled helplessly, but his heart warmed.

With brothers like this, what else could he ask for in life?

“Alright! Then we’ll go together!”

Han Tuo laughed. He wasn’t afraid that the Ultimate God of Punishment would hear him. Although the two sides did not say anything directly, they had already broken up.

The Five Great Divine Punishers were about to leave when the Divine Robe Daoist caught up.

“Five Divine Punishers, don’t be anxious. Why don’t you wait in my Dao Field?”

The Divine Robe Daoist cupped his hands and smiled warmly.

The five Divine Punishers looked at each other.

Yi Tian rolled his eyes and smiled. “Then go. We’ll talk when you’re there!”

“That’s right, that’s right!”

The Divine Robe Daoist smiled and looked at him with admiration.

Han Tuo hesitated for a moment but still nodded in agreement.

The order regarding the Ultimate God of Punishment did not spread in the Chaos, but as the Great Dao Divine Spirits knew how to take sides, the forces heading to the Ancient Desolate began to decrease.

The Great Dao Divine Spirits looked high and mighty, but each controlled different major factions. Under the major factions, there were countless connections. They could send messages at the first level and have great influence. Any faction that had a foothold in the Chaos would have their greatest backing on a Great Dao Divine Spirit.

Gradually, the Ancient Desolate calmed down.

The Heavenly Dao also sensed that something was wrong.

In the Universal Hall.

The Sages gathered.

Heavenly Venerate Wufa frowned. “Recently, it seems that the various factions no longer target the Ancient Desolate, other than the forces of heaven and earth in this domain.”

Divine Might Buddha asked, “Is it because the Ancient Desolate is too strong?”

“Something’s wrong. Even the number of scouts has decreased by more than half.”

Pan Xin shook his head. A hint of fear appeared in his eyes at the mention of the Ancient Desolate.

He had once tried to enter the Ancient Desolate, but he had returned in failure and almost died inside even with the Killing Dao Token.

The Sages’ expressions were solemn.

Unlike in the past, the enemy had already appeared this time, but he did not attack the Heavenly Dao. The Heavenly Dao knew where the other party was, but it couldn’t do anything

How many mighty figures had gone to the Ancient Desolate and suffered a crushing defeat? The pressure on the Heavenly Dao was naturally huge.

Qiu Xilai narrowed his eyes. “I feel that someone might be pushing this matter from behind. Could it be that the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit has negotiated with other factions? Their current goal is to flatten the Heavenly Dao?”

The Sages panicked.

It was not impossible.

After all, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit didn’t say that he wanted to overturn the Chaos.

If the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit only wanted to deal with the Heavenly Dao, just like in the past, no one would help no matter how strong the Heavenly Dao’s enemies were.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “It’s fine. This also means that the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was severely injured earlier, so he’s afraid of the Chaos and has no choice but to negotiate. The various factions can only retreat. Although the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit still hates the Heavenly Dao, the Heavenly Dao has also gained time to become stronger. During this period of time, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit has to recuperate and continue to prepare for the attack on the Heavenly Dao. It seems he gained time, but so has the Heavenly Dao.”

The Sages nodded and felt that it made sense.

Xu Dudao smiled. “In the past hundreds of thousands of years, our cultivation levels have increased one after another. I have to say that the providence of the Heavenly Dao is indeed useful. I’m also about to attain Freedom.”

Speaking of cultivation, the Sages smiled. The providence of sacrificing the Heavenly Dao caused the cultivation levels of all the Sages to increase. Ten Freedom Sages had already been born and would continue to increase.

The Freedom Sage was only referring to the cultivation realm here. The Heavenly Dao Sage was not as carefree as the Freedom Sage and was forever restricted by the Heavenly Dao.

The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate smiled and said, “I wonder if we can use providence to become a Great Dao Sage.”

Everyone’s gaze landed on Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, and the three Sages. They had the greatest hope.

Although the Sacred True Martial Buddha of the Buddhist World was at the perfected Freedom Realm, he was still an outsider, after all. He couldn’t use the providence of the Heavenly Dao to break through. His cultivation had already been stuck for countless years. It was difficult for him to attain the Great Dao without a huge opportunity. The three Sages looked extremely confident in the eyes of the Sages.

They were determined to reach the Great Dao Realm!

Especially Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If he wanted to sit firmly on the second throne of the Heavenly Dao, he had to cross the Great Dao Realm. Otherwise, it would be very difficult for him to convince the masses.

“Regarding the Ancient Desolate, continue to keep an eye on it. At the same time, the development of the Heavenly Dao can’t fall behind. We have to continue opening more Chaotic Heavenly Roads. There aren’t enough Chaotic Cities, either. We have to set up a tight defensive line. We won’t give the Dao Devils a chance to enter the Heavenly Dao,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du instructed. The Sages nodded and dispersed.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du revealed a worried expression when he was alone.

The power of the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit exceeded his imagination.

“Even Teacher is not his match. Can the Heavenly Sage kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du thought silently.

He recalled the calamities in the past. Han Jue could always kill enemies forcefully. This was his confidence.

If not for Han Jue, how could he dare to return to the Heavenly Dao without hesitation?

“In that case, I’ll believe him until the end!” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du thought firmly. He knew his limits. No matter how strong his management ability was, the Heavenly Dao was still protected by the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.

Logically speaking, he had to rely on Han Jue now. Even if he returned to Laozi, he would only be ostracized.

Only by walking a path to the end was it correct!

Inside the Daoist temple.

Han Jue opened his eyes. The Ultimate Origin Power in his body had transformed again in the past hundred thousand years. It was extremely powerful.

His current strength had already reached an indescribable level. With a glance, he could make the Heavenly Dao cease to exist.

So powerful!

The Ultimate Origin Power did not have to come into contact with the enemy to destroy the main body. Instead, it could fight the enemy in an unimaginable situation.

It was uncatchable, unfathomable, and unpredictable, but it contained a fatal and domineering destructive power!

In a sense, Han Jue was no longer a Great Dao Supreme. He had reached an even stronger realm, but he was just inferior to a Dao Creator.

Han Jue’s gaze landed on the Primordial World.

The Life Fiendcelestial was hiding in a star to cultivate. During this period of time, three balls of Fiendcelestial Qi transformed into Chaotic Fiendcelestials, and they lived in different places.

At this rate, a large amount of Fiendcelestial Qi would be successfully nurtured in the next million years.

What would the Primordial World be like at that time?

Han Jue was looking forward to it!
