Chapter 235 Complete Annihilation, The Unfathomable Han Jue

“From today onwards, all of you are to stay on the mountain and cultivate. Without my permission, you’re not allowed to leave the mountain. Do you understand?”

Han Jue looked down at the eight kneeling brothers and smiled.

His expression was kind, but his tone was very serious.

The eight brothers hurriedly promised not to leave the mountain.

They had yet to realize how long this rule would last. They were excited and interested in everything after transforming.

Han Jue walked to the Fusang Tree and meditated. Then, he waved his hand to signal the eight brothers to come over.

The eight brothers came over obediently, very curious about what he would say.

The others understood that he wanted to teach them a cultivation technique.

Han Jue thought for a moment and decided to teach them the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique. He was about to reach the end of this technique. His greatest reliance was not the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique, nor was he afraid of being surpassed by the eight brothers.

Besides, he could teach them level by level.

The other cultivation techniques of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect were also not suitable for them.

The eight brothers were unlike the others, who each had an Immortal inheritance.

Han Jue wasn’t worried that the Calabash Brothers would betray him. He had already placed the Six Paths Insignia on them before they were born.

After spending a day imparting the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique’s cultivation technique to the eight brothers, Han Jue returned to his cave abode to continue cultivating

He looked forward to the eight brothers’ future.

With their potential, they should be able to rise quickly.

In the future, if the Reroll World was in trouble, they could help.

The eight brothers’ talent made others feel threatened, including Long Hao.

Forty years later.

Han Jue was already close to the perfected Reincarnation Golden Immortal Realm.

One day, he opened his eyes and took out the Book of Misfortune to curse the enemies while checking his emails.

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by Jie School cultivators and was severely injured.)

(Your good friend Li Yao has joined the Heavenly Court.)

(Your grand-disciple Murong Qi has achieved the providence of the War God. His cultivation has increased greatly.]

(Your good friend Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mighty figure.]

[Your Dao Companion Xuan Qingjun was attacked by a Heavenly Soldier] x3281 (Your disciple Su Qi had his bad luck absorbed. His divinity has weakened.]

Han Jue frowned.

What was wrong with Su Qi? His bad luck was actually absorbed by someone?

Han Jue was very worried, but he didn’t know where Su Qi was. He couldn’t save him even if he wanted to.

Why didn’t this kid use the Invocation Technique?

Could it be that the Sacred Dynasty had an Immortal Emperor? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Han Jue also noticed that the Jie School and the Heavenly Court had started fighting.

Even Xuan Qingjun joined.

Han Jue immediately took out the Heavenly Dao Token and contacted Di Taibai.

Soon, Di Taibai’s divine sense arrived. “Wait for me to find you. I’m busy fighting to the death!”

With that, he severed his divine sense connection.

Han Jue remained silent.

So dangerous?

Could it be that the Jie School was stronger than the Demon Court?

Han Jue immediately checked the strongest person around the Reroll World and didn’t find any enemies.

Immediately after, he used the Heavenly Dao Token to observe the world. The White-Robed Buddha had already returned to seclusion, but the roots of the Chan School were deeply rooted in the world.

Chan School, Jie School, and Human School were all orthodox schools of the Dao Sect, but their names were different. The Dao techniques of the Chan School had a long history in the mortal world. Many cultivators used their techniques as the foundation to create various cultivation techniques, spells, and Mystical Powers. In the past few years, the mortal world had welcomed an era of blooming flowers. The cultivation craze had also reached an unprecedented height. It had to be said that the White-Robed Buddha was very capable. He had strengthened the Reroll World alone.

He had to think of a way to subdue him.

Han Jue thought silently.

Then, he stopped thinking about it. He put away the Heavenly Dao Token and continued cultivating.

Heavenly Court, Numinous Palace.

The Heavenly Emperor sat on the throne expressionlessly. Following his gaze, the sky outside the hall was filled with battling figures. It was extremely chaotic.

A figure transformed into a shadow and rushed into the Numinous Palace.

It was a man in a golden Daoist robe. Three swords floated behind him, their sheaths emitting a strong light and his sleeves fluttering in the wind. He was handsome and powerful

He stared at the Heavenly Emperor and said, “Heavenly Emperor, are we still going to continue this battle? Release the souls of my disciples and I’ll lead the Jie School disciples to retreat.”

The Heavenly Emperor smiled gently and said, “Xian Chenzi, do you really think that the few of you from the Jie School can shake the Heavenly Court?”

Xian Chenzi stroked his beard and said, “Our Jie School doesn’t want to disturb the Heavenly Dao. We only want to save our disciples and cultivate in peace.”

The Heavenly Emperor said, “It’s impossible for those Jie School disciples to be released. That was their mistake in the Immeasurable Calamity. This is the punishment of the Heavenly Dao. Let me give you a piece of advice. Don’t go against the heavens!”

Xian Chenzi’s eyes narrowed. He raised his right hand, and the three swords behind him quickly split into dozens of sword shadows that bloomed like flowers.

At this moment!

Four pillars of light descended from the top of the Numinous Palace, surrounding him.

A terrifying aura enveloped the hall.

Xian Chenzi was moved and said in a low voice, “Four Extreme Emperors! Heavenly Emperor, were you waiting for me on purpose?”

The Heavenly Emperor said calmly, “Since the Jie School has planted spies in the Heavenly Court, why can’t I arrange spies in the Jie School?

“Four Extreme Emperors, I invite you to kill this person. Seal his soul in the divine pillar of the Numinous Palace to never be released again!”

The Heavenly Emperor’s tone became extremely domineering and unquestionable.

The Four Extreme Emperors shouted in unison from the pillars of light, “Kill!”

Boom

Four years later.

Han Jue was cultivating when he suddenly sensed an aura.

He raised an eyebrow.

It was Xuan Qingjun!

Why had she descended into the mortal world?

Wait!

How could she bypass Divine Lord Wu De?

Xuan Qingjun was meditating in a forest near the Jade Pure Sacred Sect, absorbing the Immortal Qi from the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain to heal her injuries.

Han Jue appeared in front of her. Xuan Qingjun opened her eyes and asked in surprise, “Grand Unity True Immortal?”

This kid…

She had cultivated with all her might in the Immortal World and obtained all sorts of opportunities. She had barely broken through to the Grand Unity True Immortal Realm not long ago, but Han Jue had already…

Han Jue noticed her injuries and couldn’t help but raise his hand to heal her head using his Dharmic powers.

Xuan Qingjun’s eyes widened.

Such Dharmic powers…

Han Jue’s Dharmic powers were unfathomable. She actually felt that she was facing her master in the Jie School.

Xuan Qingjun was deeply shocked.

As Han Jue treated her, he asked, “Why did you come down?”

Xuan Qingjun sighed. “I used a special method to escape. I think only the mortal world is safe now. I joined a sect, and it actually wanted to attack the Heavenly Court. I was forced to join, but… all of us were wiped out…”

Complete annihilation?

Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

Was the Heavenly Court that impressive?

Why was it so difficult to defeat the Demon Court, then?

Could it be that the Jie School was no longer as powerful as it was during the Divine Investiture Era?

“The previous battle showed me the power of immortals. No wonder the Heavenly Court can control the heavenly rules.” Xuan Qingjun was very depressed.

It wasn’t easy for her to join a powerful sect. However, before long, it was defeated. Although the Jie School wasn’t destroyed, the people they sent were all suppressed, including her master’s lineage.

Now, she had nowhere to go and had to be careful of the Heavenly Court’s pursuit. Han Jue said, “It’s fine. I can protect you. But how did you escape from the immortals outside?”

He had to ask.

This was to prevent enemies from sneaking in in the future.
