Chapter 981 Different Sword Dao River

Han Jue sized up his youngest daughter again.

She was really like him.

Be it appearance or personality.

Han Jue suddenly felt that he had a successor. Han Huang had never given him such a feeling

“I have to nurture her well. Ling’er will deal with them if the little fellows outside dare to rebel.”

Han Jue smiled when he thought of this.

Han Ling asked, “Father, can you bring me to the Chaotic Assembly? Although I’m not participating, I also want to see the strength of the Chaotic geniuses.”

Han Jue nodded and brought his other wives and children to watch the battle.

The father and daughter chatted for a while before Han Jue started to check his emails.

As the Chaotic Assembly approached, the battles in his circle of friends began to increase. Most of them were attacked and were rarely severely injured. They were probably sparring.

Then, Han Jue’s gaze landed on the Ultimate Origin World in the depths of his soul.

The first Chaotic Fiendcelestial, the Life Fiendcelestial, had already attained the Dao. The Ultimate Origin World was higher than the previous Primordial Chaos and Chaos. There was no way to create living beings for the time being even if the Life Fiendcelestial attained the Dao.

It couldn’t figure out how to create them.

It was mainly because it was ignorant.

The reason why it wanted to create living beings was that it felt lonely.

Han Jue thought for a moment and sent a wisp of his will into the Ultimate Origin World.

At this moment, the Life Fiendcelestial was cultivating on a planet with an ocean, land, mountains, and trees.

The Life Fiendcelestial’s body was larger than a mountain. Sitting in the mountains, every breath would stir up a terrifying peak and shake the forest. It was like a snake with three heads. The head in the middle looked like a man with fierce eyes and eyebrows. The heads on both sides looked like women. Its facial features were demonic and its long hair fluttered.

A figure emitting a dazzling divine light appeared in front of the Life Fiendcelestial’s middle head. It was Han Jue.

The Life Fiendcelestial opened its eyes and stared at him.

No battles occurred in the Ultimate Origin World for the time being, so the Life Fiendcelestial was not afraid. It was only puzzled.

It couldn’t sense Han Jue’s aura.

Han Jue smiled and asked, “What are you confused about?”

The Life Fiendcelestial said, “I want to create existences like me… The more, the better, but I can’t succeed…”

It had to be said that the Chaotic Fiendcelestial was extremely simple. Facing the mysterious Han Jue, it also told him the truth.

There was no suspicion, no killing, no jealousy. No concepts commonly found in society had formed yet.

Han Jue smiled and said, “I have a way. You need to use the power of creation…”

He began to guide the Life Fiendcelestial to comprehend the power of creation. The three thousand Great Dao had already been formed. They were located above the Ultimate Origin World and could not reach the Great Dao.

To the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, the Ultimate Origin World was endless. However, such a huge world was filled with loneliness, making cultivation meaningless. Other than cultivating, most Chaotic Fiendcelestials were in a daze. In their respective domains, they looked up at the same lonely Ultimate Origin Universe.

After a long while…

Han Jue quietly disappeared and the Life Fiendcelestial fell into an epiphany.

Han Jue opened his eyes.

He couldn’t help but sigh. He didn’t expect that he would have to personally push the development process.

Currently, although the Ultimate Origin Qi in the Ultimate Origin World was increasing, it was far inferior to 1% of the nebulous Primordial Qi.

It still required a long time for the Primordial World to completely transform into the Ultimate Origin World.

What Han Jue didn’t lack the most now was time. He looked forward to the day when the Ultimate Origin World completely formed. He didn’t know if he could become a Dao Creator before that.

Chaos, Sword Dao River, in the pale space-time.

A river formed by sword Qi flowed away, never to return.

Dressed in a white robe, Li Daokong stood on the Sword Dao River. After millions of years, Li Daokong had become ancient. Many of his hair had turned white, but his eyes had become even sharper.

With his hands behind his waist, his robes fluttered with the sword Qi.

A figure appeared in the distance and also stood on the Sword Dao River. It was Laozi.

Laozi stared at Li Daokong and said, “What a powerful Sword Dao will. You’ve just entered the Great Dao and actually have such strength.”

Li Daokong looked at him and said, “Grandmaster, long time no see.”

Laozi said calmly, “I’m not your Grandmaster. You’re already Teacher’s successor. In terms of seniority, we should be of the same generation.”

Li Daokong smiled and looked at the Sword Dao River below. “Grandmaster, this Sword Dao River is completely different from the Heavenly Dao’s Sword Dao River. The endless sword Qi seems to contain life. Could there be a different world inside?”

Laozi’s expression changed slightly. “You can feel it?”

Li Daokong raised his right hand and the illusion of a golden river floated in his palm. He said, “This is the Sword Dao River I created. I feel that other than letting the living beings of the myriad worlds comprehend it, the Sword Dao River can also create living beings that belong to the Sword Dao. I tried and succeeded.”

Laozi was silent.

Li Daokong clenched his right hand and the golden river dissipated. He turned around and said, “Grandmaster, it seems that you have desires, after all. There’s actually another Heavenly Dao hidden in the Sword Dao River, an even stronger Heavenly Dao. No wonder your cultivation is so powerful. It can draw the power of all living beings’ faith. Impressive.”

His figure turned into stars and dissipated without waiting for Laozi to answer.

His last words echoed in the Sword Dao River. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Grandmaster, although you created the Sword Dao, I will surpass you. I will challenge you when I reach the Supreme Realm. At that time, it will not only be a battle between us, but also a battle between two Sword Dao rivers.”

Laozi did not stop Li Daokong from leaving.

His gaze landed on the vast Sword Dao River below and he muttered, “Sword Dao? That’s just your narrow definition.”

In a huge palace, two rows of stone pillars surrounded by fire dragons illuminated the hall.

Huang Zuntian sat at the head of the table. Dozens of steps below him stood existences emitting powerful auras, including Ancestor Xitian, Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, Jing Tiangong, and the others.

The weakest was at the Freedom Realm!

Huang Zuntian asked expressionlessly, “How’s the situation?”

A white-haired old Daoist was the first to speak, “Life Lord, there are more than a hundred Freedom Cultivators and seven Great Dao Sages in the Three Pure Sacred World. They are not easy to deal with.”

The others replied.

“Yes, Laozi of the Three Pure Sacred World is one of the peak existences of the Chaos.”

“It’s not only him. That Heavenly Sect Master is not easy to deal with, either.”

“I’ve investigated. The prodigy nurtured by the Three Pure Sacred World has inherited the teachings of the Human, Jie, and Chan Schools. It’s said that Laozi even gave him a cultivation technique personally passed down by the Dao Ancestor.”

“That prodigy is indeed impressive. He will not be easy to deal with if he becomes one of the Chaotic Ten Absolutes and is promoted to a Great Dao Divine Spirit.”

“I suggest we attack before the Chaotic Assembly.”

Huang Zuntian pondered after hearing his subordinates’ discussion. His right index finger tapped the armrest rhythmically. Ancestor Xitian took a step forward and said, “You have to deal with Laozi first if you want to deal with the Three Pure Sacred World. Life Lord, think twice.”

Huang Zuntian leaned forward and smiled. “The Three Pure Sacred World has to be controlled. As for how to deal with Laozi, I have a way. If Laozi is not in the Three Pure Sacred World, can you be confident in flattening the Three Pure Sacred World and seizing its lineage?”
