Chapter 247 Devil Heart of the Buddhist Sect, Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil

Han Jue brought Dao Comprehension Sword out of the Connate Cave Abode and arrived in front of the Fusang Tree. He discovered that the branches of the Fusang Tree were shaking violently. More than one branch was shaking.

Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce who was shaking the Fusang Tree.

Soon, he saw a sinister dragon head roaring at him, interrupting his deduction.

Dragon?

No!

Like a dragon but not a dragon!

What was the Fusang Tree attracting?

Han Jue continued to deduce. Just like before, he was snapped by the mysterious dragon head.

Forget it!

I’ll deal with whatever comes my way!

Han Jue shook his head. He couldn’t be bothered to think about it.

If an Immortal Emperor attacked, the Heavenly Emperor would definitely come. Anyone below the Immortal Emperor Realm would be killed!

Han Eight suddenly came in front of Han Jue and bowed respectfully. “Master, I can feel that the Fusang Tree is panicking.”

“You can sense its emotions?” Han Jue asked curiously.

Although the Fusang Tree had been growing, it had not developed intelligence.

Han Eight nodded.

Han Jue smiled and said, “Then, think of a way to comfort it. Don’t worry. No matter who comes, they won’t be able to harm it.”

With that, he turned around and left.

To the Eight Calabash Brothers, the Fusang Tree was equivalent to their mother. They were born from it.

The others discussed again.

There was an example before. If the Fusang Tree shook, it would definitely attract the enemy.

Ah Da and Xiao Er were attracted by the Fusang Tree and almost died in Han Jue’s hands. They were still terrified when they recalled it.

After returning to the cave abode, Han Jue continued to cultivate the Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering Technique. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Several years later.

Han Jue was 2,500 years old.

This was considered his birthday. Deciding to celebrate, he took out the Book of Misfortune.

The Fusang Tree wasn’t shaking as violently as before, but it still shook from time to time.

Han Jue cursed as he checked the experts near the Reroll World.

He was surprised to discover that Divine Lord Wu De had left.

Apart from that, no enemies had infiltrated the Reroll World for the time being.

Han Jue continued cultivating after cursing all the enemies.

On the other side.

In a temple.

The White-Robed Buddha was meditating and reciting the scriptures. His expression changed from painful to cheerful and sinister at times.

After a long while…

He suddenly opened his eyes and exhaled.

He frowned and gritted his teeth, cursing, “Damn it! This Devil Heart can’t be dispersed at all!

“Is Buddha suspecting me again?” The White-Robed Buddha felt uneasy.

He adjusted his emotions and continued cultivating He didn’t notice when a ball of invisible black Qi descended from the sky and entered the top of his head.

…

In the blink of an eye.

Another fifty years passed.

With the help of the Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering Technique, Han Jue’s body kept growing stronger, and his Dharmic powers increased exponentially.

In the simulation trial, Han Jue fought for two hours before finally killing Jiang Yi.

He was extremely excited.

Jiang Yi was an Immortal Emperor!

The next time he saw him, he didn’t have to be so humble.

Han Jue was satisfied.

He was very much looking forward to stepping into the Immortal Emperor Realm.

He could kill an Immortal Emperor before he even became one. How powerful would he be when he reached the Emperor Realm?

Even Han Jue himself found it terrifying!

Han Jue habitually checked the world and suddenly saw a message:

[Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil: Cultivation unknown. From the Chaos]

Unknown cultivation level?

Immortal Emperor!

Shocked, Han Jue hurriedly used the simulation trial.

A second later, he opened his eyes with a strange expression.

This Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil was actually in the form of a remnant soul.

It couldn’t withstand a single blow from him!

What happened?

How dare he barge into the Reroll World?

Han Jue immediately checked his location.

He discovered that the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil was actually on the White-Robed Buddha!

The White-Robed Buddha was in seclusion, but his face was dark, and there was a murderous aura between his brows.

Something was wrong!

Was he being possessed? Han Jue immediately stood up and moved to the White-Robed Buddha’s temple. He directly broke through the restriction in the temple and arrived in front of the White-Robed Buddha.

He raised his hand and used the Six Paths Soul Absorption Technique, wanting to suck the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil out.

“What are you doing!” A voice followed, filled with fear. Han Jue ignored him and forcefully sucked the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil out. As the ball of black gas flew out of the White-Robed Buddha’s body, it turned into black mist and exploded, filling the temple.

Han Jue clearly felt a terrifying killing intent envelop him. He stomped his right foot and executed the Reincarnation Sword Intent to disperse it.

He then used the Six Paths Soul Absorption Technique again and sucked it into the depths of his essence soul.

The countless stars of the Stellar Primordial Body burst forth with terrifying Dharmic powers, turning into chains that bound the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil.

“Who are you?

“What are you doing!

“Let me go!”

Han Jue ignored the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil’s roar and looked at the White-Robed Buddha.

The black aura dissipated, and the White-Robed Buddha revealed himself. His complexion began to recover.

The White-Robed Buddha slowly opened his eyes and was shocked when he saw Han Jue.

He asked cautiously, “Fellow Daoist Sun Quan, what’s the matter?”

Han Jue stared at him and asked, “Do you know the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil?”

The White-Robed Buddha shook his head.

Then, he suddenly thought of something and his expression changed. “What did you see just now?” the White-Robed Buddha asked nervously.

Han Jue said expressionlessly, “If I didn’t come, you would have already been possessed.”

Hearing that, the White-Robed Buddha broke out in a cold sweat. The more he thought about it, the more afraid he became.

“It’s fine if you don’t want to say it.”

Han Jue turned around and prepared to leave.

The White-Robed Buddha hurriedly shouted, “Wait! I’ll talk!”

Since Han Jue could save him, he naturally wouldn’t harm him.

In addition, the two of them were connected by providence now. The White-Robed Buddha felt that there was no need to hide it. He might even be able to obtain Han Jue’s help.

“I don’t know any Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil, but the Buddhist Sect has a Devil Heart that every disciple has to nurture. This is a method the Buddhist Sect uses to prevent their disciples from betraying them. The Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil you mentioned might be the Devil Heart given to me by the Heavenly Dao Buddha.” The White-Robed Buddha sighed.

Han Jue was even more surprised.

The Buddhist Sect nurtured the Devil Heart?

What kind of reverse cliché was this? The White-Robed Buddha continued, “I’m not sure about the origins of the Devil Heart. Every disciple has a different Devil Heart. As their cultivation progresses, the Devil Heart will also become stronger. Powerful Buddhas can even use the Devil Heart as a means of combat. However, you know my background. I dislike the Devil Heart.”

He sighed.

Han Jue said, “I’ve already taken your Devil Heart.”

The White-Robed Buddha was stunned and hurriedly checked his body.

He was pleasantly surprised! He really took it away!

Impossible!

The Devil Heart was very difficult to remove!

Han Jue turned around and left.

The White-Robed Buddha gritted his teeth and suddenly knelt behind Han Jue. He kowtowed heavily and said, “Thank you for your help, Senior! I owe you my life!”

Removing the Devil Heart was equivalent to giving him a new life! (White-Robed Buddha’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 5 stars]

Han Jue waved his hand and disappeared without looking back.

He quickly returned to the Connate Cave Abode.

He sat on the bed and began to check on the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil whose soul had been imprisoned.

“Tell me your background.”

Han Jue’s voice sounded, startling the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil.

The Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil was like a ghost. Its entire body was black, making it difficult to see its true appearance.
