Chapter 996 Chaotic River of Destiny

Boom

The endless void exploded like a spatial bell, trembling and echoing.

Jiang Jueshi and Dao Sovereign’s figures interwove crazily. They kept using their Mystical Powers. Dharmic powers and divine light stretched through the void. All sorts of Dharma Idols appeared, causing the void to seem like a world evolving faster.

They used the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm at the same time to destroy all the other party’s Dharma Idols, but they couldn’t hurt the other party.

“I didn’t expect Master to also teach him…”

This thought appeared in their minds.

Although their cultivation levels were already powerful, none of their Mystical Powers had greater destructive power than the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.

The power of the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm also caused a discussion among the mighty figures in the hall.

“Is this the Mystical Power that the Heavenly Sage used against the prodigies?”

“It looks ordinary, but its destructive power is truly terrifying.”

“I’ve heard of it. This is the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm. It has the creation of the Great Dao and can be considered a Great Dao Mystical Power. A Mystical Power that can compare to the Great Dao is naturally powerful.”

“The Hidden Sect’s lineage will be indestructible with this Mystical Power.”

“These two are both impressive. They can dominate an area.”

It was not only the discussion in the hall. The entire Ten Absolute City was also bustling with noise and exclamations.

They had already remembered Jiang Jueshi’s and Dao Sovereign’s names. Those who could come to Ten Absolute City were all outstanding. Jiang Jueshi and Dao Sovereign were very famous in the Chaos.

The Hidden Sect was also paying attention nervously. It was really difficult to decide the outcome of the battle.

Han Huang frowned. Logically speaking, he naturally hoped that Jiang Jueshi could win, as he did not understand Dao Sovereign.

He knew Jiang Jueshi’s strength well. He didn’t expect there to be an existence in the Hidden Sect who could resist him.

He looked around. Were these Chaotic Fiendcelestials all so strong?

He suddenly couldn’t understand.

“No wonder Father is so calm about my improvement…”

Han Huang felt ashamed. What was his father thinking when he showed off to him?

“They’re getting serious!” Zhao Xuanyuan suddenly said excitedly.

Jiang Yi also looked expectant.

All the disciples knew that the three of them were inseparable. Seeing their expressions, they couldn’t help but be curious about the strength that Dao Sovereign would display.

Azure Heaven Mystic stared at Dao Sovereign in the sky, his heart beating faster.

That was…

A meandering river condensed around Dao Sovereign and occupied more than half of the void. He was like dust in the huge waves, extremely tiny. His aura soared as the river appeared, causing the void to change color.

Jiang Jueshi was moved.

“What is this?”

This was the first time Jiang Jueshi had encountered such a power. Not daring to be careless, he immediately used his Great Creation, the Great Reincarnation Creation Technique!

Divine light burst out from his body. Creation halos rose from his feet and expanded. His aura increased.

“Junior Jiang, I’m sorry. I’m not only giving Junior Huang pressure. I’m definitely taking this top position!”

Dao Sovereign laughed wantonly. The meandering river stirred up a huge wave a hundred million feet tall. Countless shadows rushed out from the waves and shouted as they attacked Jiang Jueshi.

Someone in the hall exclaimed, “The River of Destiny?”

The other mighty figures were in an uproar. Dao Sovereign could actually control the Chaotic River of Destiny?

The Heavenly Dao also had a River of Destiny, but it was insignificant compared to the Chaotic River of Destiny.

The Chaotic River of Destiny had been established for countless years. The power of karma it contained was unimaginable.

The shadows in the waves were the shadows of cultivators since ancient times. There were so many of them.

Jiang Jueshi raised his arms and circulated the Great Reincarnation Creation Technique crazily. Nine Dharma Idols that were identical to him rose above his head and waved the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm in all directions.

Boom! Boom! Boom…

The waves of destiny that came from all directions were dispersed one after another, but the River of Destiny was endless and could not be stopped by a few palms.

Jiang Jueshi felt unprecedented pressure. This pressure was even greater than when he faced Han Huang. Although Han Huang could defeat him, that was the difference in Dharmic powers.

The pressure that Dao Sovereign gave him was not as simple as Dharmic powers. He inexplicably felt like he was resisting the entire Chaos.

“The River of Destiny…” Han Ling muttered to herself as she grabbed her sleeve.

She was thinking about how her Emperor Soldiers would collide with the River of Destiny.

Han Jue was also a little surprised. Dao Sovereign was something.

He originally thought that Jiang Jueshi would definitely win, but he did not expect a variable to appear.

Even he felt that it was a variable, let alone the others. Jiang Jueshi was the Heavenly Court’s Divine General, after all. He had contributed greatly and was famous. Dao Sovereign had kept a low profile for millions of years. Very few people had heard of him before the Chaotic Assembly.

Dao Sovereign did not only control the Chaotic River of Destiny. He kept casting spells and the surrounding River of Destiny kept increasing, causing the entire void to become crowded.

“Junior Jiang, you’re really powerful. You have to know that Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi can’t stop me even if they join forces!”

Dao Sovereign laughed loudly. His voice resounded throughout Ten Absolute City. Zhao Xuanyuan’s and Jiang Yi’s smiles froze.

Damn it!

Zhao Xuanyuan slapped the table and stood up. “Junior Jiang, beat this son of a b*tch!”

The Black Hell Chicken smiled. “Come on. Jiang Jueshi shouldn’t be able to win.”

Zhao Xuanyuan was even more furious.

“No!”

Chu Shiren’s voice suddenly sounded. Everyone looked at the sky. The surging waves of the Chaotic River of Destiny parted on both sides. Jiang Jueshi, who was covered in divine light, stepped out. His figure grew several times taller with every step he took. The rings of light constantly surged into his body. Strange and mysterious golden runes began to appear around his body. They looked like words and patterns.

Jiang Jueshi’s long hair fluttered as it lost its black color from the divine light. His eyes lost their pupils, and a black circle appeared between his eyebrows. Wisps of black aura overflowed and continued to strengthen like raging flames.

Jiang Jueshi’s robes fluttered as his aura increased again.

“Senior Dao, you’re indeed powerful. I wanted to leave this move to Junior Huang, but I didn’t expect you to force it out. Your River of Destiny is indeed powerful, but my Great Reincarnation Creation Technique is also extraordinary. Today, I want my Great Creation to become famous in the Chaos!”

Jiang Jueshi’s voice sounded. It was also loud, but compared to Dao Sovereign’s arrogance and smugness, it was even more holy.

He waved his right hand, and the golden runes around him attacked like a tornado. The black circle between his eyebrows overflowed with a black aura and became the center of the tornado. It was like a black sword Qi that pressed forward and dispersed the Chaotic River of Destiny. It was unstoppable.

Dao Sovereign’s expression changed slightly. He immediately formed a seal, and two divine weapons flew out from the River of Destiny on both sides. They were like halberds, one black and one white. They crossed ten thousand feet away and blocked Jiang Jueshi’s Great Creation Mystical Power.

The black and white halberds trembled violently. The sound produced by the collision was deafening and extremely ear-piercing.

In a flash, the black and white halberds suddenly fused together. A terrifying force erupted and dispersed Jiang Jueshi’s Great Creation Mystical Power, causing the void to shake violently.

“Oh no!”

The Ultimate God of Punishment suddenly disappeared from the hall and appeared in the void of the battle, using his Dharmic powers to stabilize the space.

His appearance caused an uproar in Ten Absolute City.

The battle between the two could actually break the power of rules set by the Ultimate God of Punishment?
