Chapter 804 Curse Great Dao

[The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial sent you a dream. Do you accept?]

[The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial sent you a dream. Do you accept?]

Notifications kept appearing in front of Han Jue, making him speechless.

It was fine if the Sages did this, but the Great Dao Supreme was still so anxious!

What nonsense was this?

Han Jue thought for a moment and still chose to accept the dream.

The dream was the palace of the Grand Primordium Domain.

Han Jue saw the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial meditating ten thousand feet away.

Their eyes met and neither side spoke immediately.

The atmosphere was strange and awkward.

After a long while…

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial asked, “Han Jue, do you know what your son did?”

Han Jue said, “I know. He was bewitched by the Devil Ancestor. However, the Devil Ancestor is too strong. I’m helpless.”

Speaking of this, he couldn’t help but sigh in shame.

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial stared at him and asked, “You mean that he’s being controlled by the Devil Ancestor now and is no longer himself?”

“That’s right. Otherwise, why would I let him follow the Devil Ancestor?”

Han Jue nodded and sighed. “I didn’t want to trouble the Fiendcelestial Race about this. After all, the Devil Ancestor didn’t attack the Heavenly Dao and only abducted one of my sons. I couldn’t ask for help. I didn’t expect Senior Grand Primordium to take the initiative to mention it. I’m really touched, and I feel even more ashamed. I underestimated the unity of the Fiendcelestial Race and the arrogance of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.”

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial was silent.

Han Jue was immersed in sorrow and helplessness as he sighed.

After a while.

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial said, “The Fiendcelestial Race will declare war on the Devil Ancestor. I will help you save your son. Wait for the order.”

With that, the dream shattered.

[The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 2 stars]

Han Jue opened his eyes and almost took out the Book of Misfortune when he saw this notification.

It was obvious that the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial was also an old fox. It didn’t believe Han Jue at all, but it couldn’t blame him.

This was also good. He could let the Fiendcelestial Race restrain the Devil Ancestor. It would be best if they fought until both sides were injured. Han Jue would attack Life again, causing a delay to the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity and giving the Heavenly Dao time to rise.

Han Jue sent a dream to Han Tuo.

The dream was on a city wall. It was the old city that Han Tuo had guarded when he was young

Han Tuo opened his eyes and was stunned when he saw this scene. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He noticed him and hurriedly came back to his senses. He knelt down and bowed.

“Father!”

Han Jue looked at Han Tuo, who was much stronger than before, and sighed.

The current Han Tuo really looked like a demon.

Han Jue said, “How have you been?”

Facing his question, Han Tuo did not hide anything. He told him everything about fusing the demonic path and devouring the Chaotic Fiendcelestial.

This also indirectly proved that Han Tuo did not have a change of heart towards Han Jue.

In short, Han Tuo still maintained his true nature, but the process of becoming stronger was no longer as glorious and bright as before.

Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan had already recovered his body. His short-term goal was to gather the devils again. As for the future plans, Han Tuo did not know for the time being.

Han Jue said, “The Chaotic Fiendcelestials will hunt you and the Devil Ancestor down. This happened because of you. Be very careful.”

Han Tuo was moved, but he did not panic.

The threat level of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial and that of the entire Fiendcelestial Race was worlds apart.

Furthermore, the Chaotic Fiendcelestials they had fought before were all at the bottom or severely injured.

“I understand.”

Han Tuo agreed.

Han Jue was a little disappointed upon seeing that he didn’t need his help. He said, “Remember, don’t say that I revealed the information. If you really can’t hold on, you can summon me at any time.”

Han Tuo opened his eyes. He sat on a white skeleton that was as huge as a mountain range. Yi Tian was still alive beside him.

Yi Tian smiled and said, “You were in a daze just now. Could it be that your father was visiting you in your dreams?”.

They had just finished devouring the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. There might be a reaction between them.

Han Tuo said, “No, but the situation might not be good.”

He looked up at the dark universe and felt that there were pairs of eyes staring at him.

Yi Tian sighed. “This Fiendcelestial Qi, blood, and providence are really good things. No wonder Pangu wanted to kill three thousand Fiendcelestials and absorb their providence. How strong is he?”

“Don’t think about it. It’s impossible for us to reach that height. After all, there are only dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials alive now. Most of them are the strongest existences in the Chaos.” Han Tuo shook his head.

Yi Tian chuckled.

At this moment, a voice floated into their ears.

“Leave this place and return to the Demonic Path Abyss.”

It was the Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan’s voice.

The two of them immediately stood up and left without hesitation.

Their greatest reliance now was the Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan. There was definitely trouble if even he said so.

In the blink of an eye.

Han Jue entered seclusion for another ten thousand years.

He was already 1.6 million years old!

He opened his eyes and took out the Book of Misfortune to curse the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial.

After so long, the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial shouldn’t think of Han Jue if he was cursed.

He checked his emails while cursing.

There was no email message from Han Tuo and Yi Tian. They had probably been hiding in seclusion for the past ten thousand years.

Five days later.

Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune.

He only wanted to divert the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s attention and not curse it to death.

Han Jue hesitated again after putting away the Book of Misfortune.

Wasn’t five short days too light?

After thinking about it, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing again.

Another five days passed.

Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease, but he didn’t stop. He still cursed the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial with all his might.

Even the First Life Black Sovereign could be cursed until something went wrong. Han Jue was naturally confident in dealing with the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial.

A hundred million years!

10 billion years!

A trillion years!

100 trillion years!

1 quadrillion years!

10 quadrillion years!

Han Jue started to feel the pinch. Fortunately, an email finally appeared.

[Because of your curse, your enemy, the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s providence had become chaotic and his Great Dao has been damaged.]

Han Jue immediately stopped.

It took him ten quadrillion years to curse until something went wrong…

Wasn’t it impossible to curse him to death?

The Book of Misfortune was clearly a Great Dao Supreme Treasure. This thing lacked the power to end things.

Han Jue smiled and became happy. He continued cultivating.

Grand Primordium Domain, in the palace.

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s expression darkened. Wisps of strange black aura surrounded him and were slowly dissipating

“What a terrifying curse! Could it be the legendary Dark Forbidden Lord?

“To be able to hurt me, the other party must be a Great Dao Supreme. Could it be the Great Dao of Curses?” the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial muttered to himself, his eyes filled with killing intent.

Because of Life, the name of the Dark Forbidden Lord had already spread in the Chaos. Life had provided a large amount of information. All cultivators targeted by the Dark Forbidden Lord would not die at first, but in the years to come, the Dark Forbidden Lord would torture them from time to time until they let down their guard, then he would curse crazily, forcing the other party to die or only protect a trace of their remnant souls.

This action was extremely sinister!
