Chapter 43: Sixth-Grade Defensive Numinous Treasure, Severely Injured Elder

“Why did he suddenly have a favorable impression of me?”

Han Jue frowned. Things were getting harder.

It was difficult for him to do anything to someone who liked him.

Huang Jihao walked in front of Han Jue and said, “Brat, I have an affinity with you. Do you want to take me as your master? It won’t be difficult for you to reach the Nascent Soul realm in the future.”

To Foundation Establishment Cultivators, the Nascent Soul realm was the biggest dream!

He didn’t believe that Han Jue wouldn’t be moved.

Affinity?

Han Jue had a strange look.

What sort of affinity could there be between men?

Could it be... Han Jue shivered and felt goosebumps. He took a step back.

“Who are you? Why are you here at the Jade Pure Sect?” Han Jue asked in a low voice.

Huang Jihao teased, “I’m Huang Jihao of the Vermilion Bird Sword Sect. Have you heard of me? I came to the Jade Pure Sect this time to challenge your Deity Slaying Elder!”

Han Jue asked, “Why challenge the Deity Slaying Elder and not the Sect Master?”

“Your sect master and former sect master were defeated by me long ago. Only the Deity Slaying Elder has the right to make me fight. I originally couldn’t be bothered to deal with you and wanted to challenge the Raincoat Sect. However, the people of the Raincoat Sect insisted that I deal with the Deity Slaying Elder before telling me their location.”

Huang Jihao spoke very casually, causing Han Jue’s hatred for the Raincoat Sect to soar to six stars!

Han Jue asked, “Are there many Soul Formation experts in the Raincoat Sect? How’s their sect master’s strength?”

“There are indeed many Soul Formation cultivators. After all, they have thousands of years of foundation. As for their leader, he’s very mysterious. I’m not sure, either.”

“What are your chances of challenging the Raincoat Sect?”

“Why are you asking so many questions? Are you going to acknowledge me as your master or not?”

[Huang Jihao’s favorability towards you has decreased. Current favorability: 1 star]

Huang Jihao looked impatient.

Han Jue was amused. I’m just asking you a few more questions, but your good impression of me is already half gone?

Great!

Then, I won’t be soft-hearted against you!

Han Jue directly took out the Qilin Sword and said, “If you can receive one strike from me, I will acknowledge you as my master!”

Huang Jihao was also amused. “Kid, have you never heard of my name?”

“I’m asking you, do you dare to face my sword!”

“Alright! I’ll take your strike! If you can injure me in the slightest, I’ll turn around and leave. I won’t disturb the Jade Pure Sect anymore!”

“You said it!”

“Of course.”

Huang Jihao was proud and arrogant. After confirming that Han Jue was only at the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm, he didn’t take his words to heart at all.

Han Jue suddenly attacked.

The Six Paths spirit energy in his body erupted like a volcano and poured into the Qilin Sword.

Huang Jihao’s eyes widened. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

This spirit energy...

Crap!

Huang Jihao hurriedly raised his hands and circulated the surging spirit energy within his body.

Sword light flashed, and a black sword qi cut through the forest. It soared into the sky and cut the sea of clouds in half. It was a spectacular sight.

Then, the ground shook and dust flew.

Huang Jihao gritted his teeth and used all his strength to block the sword Qi of the Heavenly Punishment Ghost Deity Sword.

The terrifying sword Qi forced him to retreat. The protective shield formed by his spirit energy cracked like glass.

Not good!

He couldn’t block it!

Huang Jihao cursed under his breath and hurriedly leaped up.

The moment he did so, Han Jue’s sword Qi invaded his body, causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood. His body also leaped thousands of feet away.

The sword aura swept out and crushed the trees along the way. A huge ravine appeared on the ground. It was unfathomable, like a narrow valley.

Huang Jihao stopped and looked at Han Jue in shock.

What sword technique is this?

No!

It’s a Mystical Power!

“The famous Huang Jihao shouldn’t go back on his word, right?” Han Jue looked up and asked expressionlessly.

[Huang Jihao has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]

Han Jue didn’t panic. He stared at Huang Jihao.

Huang Jihao trembled in anger.

He wanted to kill Han Jue, but he had already said that, so he would not slap his own face.

In addition, Han Jue’s sword Qi was indeed powerful. If they really fought to the death, he might not be able to win!

He gritted his teeth and asked, “Who are you?”

“You came to find me and you ask who I am?”

Huang Jihao laughed in anger.

This was the Deity Slaying Elder of the Jade Pure Sect!

I knew it!

He lives up to his reputation!

“Hmph. Although I won’t come to the Jade Pure Sect anymore, I’ll challenge you again after you leave!”

With that, Huang Jihao left.

Han Jue smiled disdainfully and thought to himself, Wait for me to leave the Jade Pure Sect? Can you wait your whole life?

He turned around and left.

Not long after, the elders of the Jade Pure Sect rushed over. When they saw the scene of the sword Qi slashing past, they couldn’t help but feel alarmed.

However, they guessed that it was Han Jue. Otherwise, the battle would not have stopped.

Is there another powerful enemy?

...

After leaving the Jade Pure Sect, Huang Jihao stood on his flying sword, feeling indignant as he healed his injuries.

“Damn it, how dare you trick me!”

Huang Jihao was about to go mad.

If Han Jue had revealed his identity from the start, how could he have been careless?

If he had been on guard, how could he not have taken the blow?

Alright!

He couldn’t block it regardless!

But he wouldn’t have agreed so easily!

“Sigh!”

I was careless!

Just as Huang Jihao was in depression, a figure appeared in front of him, blocking his path.

“Who are you? Why did you come from the Jade Pure Sect?”

The newcomer was a cultivator in green. He was handsome and imposing. He carried a sword case on his back with four swords inside.

Huang Jihao was in an extremely bad mood. He immediately snorted. “What does that have to do with you? Scram!”

The green-robed cultivator laughed. “How dare you be so impolite to me, aren’t you afraid of death?”

“Haha, who do you think you are?”

“Then, let’s fight. Let’s see who’s the real deal!”

“You’re courting death!”

Boom—

...

Back in the cave abode.

Han Jue had just sat down when two lines of words appeared in front of him.

[You secretly defeated Huang Jihao and obtained a Numinous Treasure.]

[Congratulations on obtaining a sixth-grade Numinous Treasure—Burning Fiend Bell]

[Burning Fiend Bell: A sixth-grade defensive Numinous Treasure. It can defend against all attacks below the Void Amalgamation Realm. After injecting Spirit Qi, the bell body will increase in weight as Spirit Qi is injected until it becomes as heavy as a mountain.]

Huh?

What a treasure!

It could defend against all attacks below the Void Amalgamation Realm!

Great!

Han Jue took out the Burning Fiend Bell happily and sized it up carefully.

The bell was black and exuded an ancient and evil aura.

Han Jue immediately started to drip blood on it.

An hour later, he played with the Burning Fiend Bell.

After successfully bonding with it, the Burning Fiend Bell was like his arm. When it enveloped him, he felt extremely safe.

Wearing the Golden Cicada’s Mystic Divine Robe and covered with the Burning Fiend Bell, he could dominate everything under the heavens!

Han Jue was extremely proud.

Then, he continued cultivating.

The next morning, Fairy Xi Xuan came to visit him.

This was the first time she took the initiative to look for Han Jue.

Han Jue stood up.

“Yue’er told you about my senior, Guan Yougang. He returned yesterday, but he encountered Huang Jihao near the Jade Pure Sect and was severely injured.” Fairy Xi Xuan stopped in front of Han Jue and said directly.

Eh?

The fellow who said he wanted to be the Sect Master has just arrived and he’s already beaten up?

Han Jue couldn’t help but mourn for him.

Guan Yougang was a little weak.

Huang Jihao was already injured, yet he still couldn’t defeat him under such circumstances!

Such a person wanted to become Dao companions with his master?
