Chapter 1116 Descent of Creation, Boiling Panic!

The mighty figures of the Chaos and Primordial Chaos trembled in fear and anger at Primordial Despair’s power and the Dark Forbidden Lord’s arrogance.

Primordial Despair was naturally not so powerful. He only obtained a trace of Han Jue’s power.

“We have no way out. Put down our fear and fight to the death!”

The Ultimate God of Punishment’s voice sounded. He had greater influence than Han Huang and Zhao Shuangquan. After all, he was the highest existence in the Chaos, the leader of the gods.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Great Dao Divine Spirits and Divine Punishers began to mobilize their divine power. The three thousand Great Dao and the Seven Supreme Rules trembled. Countless powers poured down and landed on all the Great Dao Sages present.

Han Jue watched with relish and was not in a hurry to attack.

Clearly, the Ninth Chaos was supporting them from behind the scenes. Otherwise, even a Great Dao Divine Spirit would find it difficult to borrow such a strong power of rules.

The Ultimate God of Punishment even summoned fifty thousand Divine Authority Generals. The Chaotic Consciousness’ clone summoned a hundred thousand Destruction Authority Generals. More and more figures surrounded Primordial Despair.

Swish!

The sound of air being torn apart sounded. A red arrow was shot at Han Jue. It was so fast that even Primordial Despair didn’t have time to react. Unfortunately, just as it was about to touch Han Jue, it dissipated and didn’t cause any damage.

“What?”

Han Ye was moved. He had used his full strength, and it was an unexpected arrow.

Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi appeared behind Su Qi. Zhao Xuanyuan reached out to grab him, while Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi used the power of the Great Dao World to attack Han Jue.

The two Great Dao Worlds shrank in their

palms and shot out with their palms. Like

Han Ye’s arrows, they automatically dissipated when they were about to touch Han Jue.

Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi’s hearts beat wildly when they saw Han Jue’s scarlet eyes.

“Oh no! I can’t bring him away!” Zhao Xuanyuan said anxiously, his tone revealing unprecedented panic.

“Dodge!” Dao Sovereign immediately ordered.

The three brothers suddenly moved. However, the moment they did so, they were hit by a terrifying force and fell through the spatial river, disappearing into the spatial

turbulence.

Han Jue turned around and discovered that countless Mystical Powers were attacking from all directions. Dazzling light of all colors filled the dark void.

Primordial Despair opened his mouth and suddenly sucked in all the Mystical Powers.

The million-foot-tall Divine Authority Generals and Destruction Authority Generals were really as tiny as ants in the face of Primordial Despair. The Ultimate God of Punishment and the Chaotic Consciousness Avatar continued to cast spells, creating more

and more Divine Authority Generals and Destruction Authority Generals. They rushed up one after another. The scene was

spectacular.

Han Jue watched the battle with relish as he

sat on Primordial Despair’s head. “Let all living beings see your ability.”

Han Jue’s voice sounded. He used the Dream

Entering Mystical Power to cover all living

beings.

From now on, anyone who entered the dream could watch the battle.

For a time, the entire Chaos stirred.

After the news spread, more and more living

beings entered their dreams to watch the battle. Even many disciples of the Darkness Sect stopped what they were doing to watch

the battle. They wanted to see the Dark Forbidden Lord’s true strength.

Han Huang, Primordial Origin, and Huang Zuntian, the three Primordial Fiendcelestials, attacked Primordial Despair. They used their Mystical Powers and wanted to suppress it. Primordial Despair, who had obtained the

power of the Lord, was extremely violent. As his figure trembled, he emitted endless negative karma that transformed into waves that swept in all directions.

Han Huang and the other two were forced

back.

Han Ling appeared above and bent down to look down at Primordial Despair. She was like a god looking down at the evil devils in the mortal world. Emperor Soldiers swooped down like a rain of arrows, targeting Han Jue.

Primordial Despair’s eighteen eyes looked up. Blood-colored pillars of light shot out. There were countless of them, and they destroyed one Emperor Soldier after another. In less than two breaths of time, ten million

Emperor Soldiers were all destroyed. The situation was grave!

The Dark Forbidden Lord had yet to make a

move. Just Primordial Despair alone made the Chaos and Primordial Chaos helpless. Han Huang was furious. He couldn’t approach

the Dark Forbidden Lord. He was going mad. He had no choice but to use the mysterious power that he had not used for a long time.

Ultimate Origin Power!

Han Jue felt that someone was borrowing his power and ignored it.

What would happen if Han Huang used the Ultimate Origin Power? The current Han Jue was a Creator Lord.

Han Huang’s expression changed drastically.

It actually failed.

…

In the third Dao Field.

Xing Hongxuan, Xuan Qingjun, Dao Comprehension Sword, and the other Dao Companions were watching the battle.

“It’s not optimistic. They can’t do anything to

Primordial Despair even with so many mighty figures attacking together,” Dao Comprehension Sword said worriedly.

Xing Hongxuan frowned at Primordial

Despair.

For some reason, she had a subtle feeling.

Although this fellow was ferocious, she couldn’t hate him no matter what. Could it be because Primordial Despair was created by Han Huang?

“From the looks of it, the difference is indeed

huge. Only someone at your level can turn the tide.” Xuan Qingjun sighed. The Chaos was filled with capable people.

In the past, Han Huang fighting all the living beings alone was already shocking enough. He didn’t expect the Dark Forbidden Lord to appear and for him to be so strong. As the women discussed, the final battle changed. Casualties began to appear on the Chaos’ side.

Primordial Despair stretched out a long tongue. Like a torrent of fate, it swept

into

the void and directly swept away dozens of Great Dao Sages. It swallowed them and chewed ruthlessly. This scene frightened countless living beings awake from their dreams, and they did not dare to watch the battle anymore. Qingluan’er also felt extremely uncomfortable and retracted her gaze.

This sudden change truly made the Chaos feel

despair.

The three Primordial Fiendcelestials and the Nine Chaos surrounded Primordial Despair, but they didn’t cause any damage. They would definitely lose at this rate.

Zhou Song smiled bitterly. “The difference is

too great.”

Su Qi was silent. He was not in despair.

Because he had always had hope. That was his master.

As long as his master took action, the trouble

that the Chaos and Primordial Chaos could not resolve would definitely be resolved.

“You’re just worms. And you want to compete with me? You’re courting death! “Dao Creators above the Great Dao Supremes,

how long are you going to watch the show?”

Han Jue’s voice sounded, moving the mighty figures fighting. Dao Creators?

Was that a realm above the Great Dao

Supreme?

Han Huang’s expression darkened. Could it be

that there were many existences at that

realm?

“Hmph!”

A cold snort shook the Dao hearts of all the Great Dao Supremes.

The darkness above was torn apart. A pair of eyes countless times larger than Primordial Despair appeared. They were like the eyes of the heavens, cold and dignified.

Dao Creator, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable!

Primordial Despair did not care about the Dao

Creator. He was still frantically harvesting the Great Dao Sages, forcing them to continue

dealing with him before they could be shocked by Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s appearance. “Shi Tian’s creator, Immeasurable Destruction Venerable. I didn’t expect you to be the first to stand out.”

Han Jue’s indifferent identity reveal shocked

everyone from Shi Tian.

So, Shi Tian really had a Dao Creator!

Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable snorted. “Dark Forbidden Lord, you want to change the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity? This is a path that leads to death!”

The eyes disappeared as soon as he finished speaking. A huge palm that was as vast as the Chaos landed. This scene reminded Han Huang of his father in the simulation trial.

Indeed, he was on the same level as his

father!
