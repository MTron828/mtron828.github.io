Chapter 894 Divine Might Great Heaven Palm, Azure Heaven Mystic

In the third Dao Field.

Han Jue finally opened his eyes after an unknown period of time.

He had successfully created a new Great Dao Mystical Power.

He named this Mystical Power the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm!

This palm was ferocious. Any power, thing, and even rules could be destroyed. It only had the power to destroy. It was absolutely destroyed and could not be repaired.

Han Jue began the simulation trial and challenged ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages. He only used the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.

He used his domineering Dharmic powers and killed ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages with a single palm. It was very easy.

He continued to challenge more Foolish Sword Sages. He fought with twenty thousand Foolish Sword Sages before finally winning.

Han Jue suddenly had a better idea.

He used the Dharma Idol Fusion Technique to fuse with 2,449 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols before using the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.

Twenty thousand Foolish Sword Sages were insta-killed!

Han Jue’s confidence multiplied. He challenged his limits again. 25,000 Foolish Sword Sages!

He killed all of them with a single palm strike after using the Dharma Idol Fusion Technique and the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.

Previously, he had always used the Dharma Idol Fusion Technique to wield the Primordial Judgment Sword. However, the Primordial Judgment Sword was only a Dharma treasure, after all. It was more powerful if he used a Dharma treasure to wield a Mystical Power.

Han Jue decided to create another Great Dao Mystical Power regarding the Sword Dao next time.

He didn’t do it this time because the Sword Dao couldn’t bypass Laozi.

How could the Hidden Sect base itself on the Sword Dao?!

Han Jue continued the simulation trial.

In the end, he could no longer insta-kill the Foolish Sword Sages when the number reached thirty thousand. He could only win after a fierce battle.

It took him a hundred years to create the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm, but the outcome satisfied him.

The Divine Might Great Heaven Palm was definitely the most domineering palm technique Mystical Power he had ever seen!

This would be the Hidden Sect’s ultimate technique from now on!

Han Jue immediately came to the second Dao Field and preached the Dao to all the Fiendcelestials, teaching them the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.

The Chaotic Fiendcelestials were all people with powerful bodies and were not good at using Dharma treasures. Most of them liked to rely on their physical talent. Thus, they were very suitable for the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.

Han Jue directly began to preach the Dao and made the 49 Fiendcelestials enter a state of Dao comprehension as they began to comprehend the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.

A hundred years later.

Han Jue came to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and asked Han Zuitian to choose ten geniuses of the Hidden Sect. Several days later, Han Zuitian brought ten Pseudo-Sage geniuses over. They represented the sect’s hope.

Han Jue encouraged them. The ten geniuses were extremely excited. They kept kowtowing and paying respects to the ancestor.

He also harvested a wave of six-star favorability, and there were no traitors with low stars or hatred.

These geniuses’ talent was still a little lacking. They only learned it after Han Jue preached for a thousand years.

Han Jue especially reminded them that this was a secret technique of the Hidden Sect and could not be taught to outsiders.

The ten geniuses were even more excited, feeling that they had been acknowledged by their ancestor.

Han Jue waved his hand for them to leave. He didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he looked at the Immortal World and the person who had obtained the Chaotic Consciousness’ power.

The child had long grown up after more than a thousand years. He had joined the Heavenly Race and become a peerless prodigy. Although he was only a thousand years old, he was already an Immortal Emperor.

Becoming an Immortal Emperor in a thousand years. The world was shaken. His name had already spread throughout the Immortal World.

Azure Heaven Mystic!

as

.

This was not his original name. He changed his name after stepping into cultivation. He even severed all karma with the mortal world.

Azure Heaven Mystic was proud and arrogant. He was famous in the Heavenly Race. He received high treatment in the two worlds with the Heavenly Race’s power.

In just a thousand years, rumors already abounded in the Immortal World that Azure Heaven Mystic was comparable to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!

The Divine Might Heavenly Sage had become a Sage at 30,000 years old. It was not impossible for Azure Heaven Mystic to do it, too!

Han Jue smiled when he learned of this.

It would indeed be a waste if this kid couldn’t attain the Dao in thirty thousand years with a Dao Creator’s inheritance.

Han Jue began to observe Azure Heaven Mystic.

The fact that Azure Heaven Mystic had joined the Heavenly Race was equivalent to going under Han Jue. This was probably the outcome after the Sages discussed. Otherwise, how could the Heavenly Race snatch him?

Azure Heaven Mystic was extremely talented, but his personality was also extreme. At first, the Sages who did not obtain Azure Heaven Mystic were very disappointed, but they were gloating now.

Han Jue saw that Azure Heaven Mystic was bullying his fellow disciples. This fellow challenged ten thousand Immortal Emperors alone. He even humiliated them after attaining victory. He was extremely arrogant.

The humiliated Immortal Emperors didn’t dare to say anything. They couldn’t defeat him and could only endure.

This was not the first time.

“Hahahaha, you Immortal Emperors have cultivated for tens of thousands of years and finally entered the cycle of reincarnation. You don’t need to cultivate as mortals. Can you really repay the Heavenly Race for nurturing

you?

“I would definitely demote all of you to the mortal world to prevent you from embarrassing the Heavenly Race if I were the Heavenly Ancestor!”

A blue-robed youth smiled proudly on a vast platform. Ten thousand Immortal Emperors lying within a radius of a million kilometers. All of them were red in the face and trembling.

The blue-robed youth was Azure Heaven Mystic. He was handsome and had a tall figure. His waist was wrapped in a pearl ribbon and he wore cloud boots. He wore a Vermilion Bird Headband and looked like an immortal who had walked out of a painting.

A group of Heavenly Race immortals flew over at this moment. One of the fairies reprimanded him. “Azure Heaven Mystic, don’t humiliate your fellow disciples!”

Azure Heaven Mystic glanced at her and said disdainfully, “You little girl, what are you shouting for? Come down and fight me one-on-one if you have the guts. Watch as I, the Emperor Realm, trample on your Deity Realm and let you, a high and mighty fairy, cry for mercy under my feet!” The immortals around the fairy were indignant and cursed.

Azure Heaven Mystic was not angry. Instead, he laughed even more wildly.

“A bunch of ants who only dare to curse. Do you dare to come down and fight! See if I don’t beat you all until you die!”

Azure Heaven Mystic laughed wildly. He actually had the upper hand as he bickered with the other party alone.

Han Jue shook his head and laughed.

He couldn’t be bothered to do anything. After all, a Dao Creator was behind him.

He didn’t hate Azure Heaven Mystic much. Although this person had a foul mouth and was arrogant, he did not kill his fellow disciples.

It was worth mentioning that even though Azure Heaven Mystic was so famous, he did not have a single life in his hands. He hadn’t even killed worms or plants. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He wouldn’t step on flowers if he saw them when this kid was young. He would fly if he

could.

In a sense, Azure Heaven Mystic was the cleanest person in the world.

Han Jue stopped looking at him. He teleported to the third Dao Field and called Han Qing’er into the Daoist temple.

“Father, what is it?” Han Qing’er raised her eyebrows and asked in high spirits.

Han Jue said, “I recently created a Mystical Power. It will be the signature Mystical Power of the Hidden Sect in the future. Do you want to learn it?”

Han Qing’er curled her lips. “How powerful can a temporarily created Mystical Power be? Teach me some ancient Mystical Power.”

Thinking highly of ancient creations and belittling modern works. This was the same for all races.

Han Jue smiled faintly. “Why don’t you try in the dream?”

Han Qing’er hurriedly shook her head. “I’ll learn! I’ll learn!”

Han Jue immediately preached the Dao and taught the Mystical Power.

The lecture ended two hundred years later.

Han Qing’er opened her eyes in shock.

“There’s actually such a Mystical Power in the world. It’s as exquisite and profound as the Great Dao…”

Han Qing’er looked at her father in admiration. Han Jue was secretly pleased.
