Chapter 90: Profound Truth Divine Emperor, The Golden Age of a Single Person

Connate providence? Han Jue was stunned.

It had been a long time since he met a new Connate providence bearer.

He immediately chose to check.

[Murong Qi: Fourth level of the Golden Core Realm, reincarnated War God of the Upper Realm Divine Palace. His title is Profound Truth Divine Emperor. He was attacked by the Immortal Emperors of the demon race. His physical body was destroyed. His soul entered the cycle of reincarnation and came to the mortal world. In the cycle of reincarnation, his soul slowly recovered. Due to the providence of the Divine Emperor, even as a mortal, his talent was unparalleled. Unconsciously, he was attracted by the Ancient Spiritual Ginseng and came to the Jade Pure Sect.]

Han Jue was stunned.

Divine Palace War God?

Profound Truth Divine Emperor?

What level was the Divine Palace?

How was it compared to the Heavenly Court?

Han Jue suddenly felt that the Upper Realm was different from what he imagined. It seemed the Heavenly Court wasn’t the sole dominant force. There might be many powerful factions, and their relationships were very deep.

Heavenly Court, Divine Palace, Buddha—these were the ones he knew of.

On second thought, it made sense. If not for him being able to detect the Connate providence, he probably wouldn’t have noticed these incredible existences.

In novels, the protagonist would also encounter various geniuses, but he wouldn’t be able to see through their origins.

Although Murong Qi was the reincarnation of Profound Truth Divine Emperor, if he was killed in this life, it wouldn’t affect him much. Even if he regained his identity as Profound Truth Divine Emperor, he wouldn’t seek revenge.

God knew how many times Murong Qi had reincarnated. Just like Xun Chang’an, who was already at the 39th reincarnation, when he ascended to the Upper Realm in the future, he couldn’t possibly take revenge on his enemies from every lifetime.

Each lifetime had its own enemies and grudges.

The Ancient Spiritual Ginseng—who was the current Xun Chang’an—had attracted the attention of Profound Truth Divine Emperor. Would he attract other people with powerful backgrounds in the future?

Xun Chang’an wasn’t Zhu Bajie, but simply Tang Seng[1] himself!

Han Jue used his divine sense to search for him.

Murong Qi and a group of cultivators were flying towards the Jade Pure Sect. The leader was Guan Yougang.

These cultivators were not wearing the Daoist robes of the Jade Pure Sect. They had probably just been recruited.

Han Jue’s attention landed on Murong Qi.

Looking youthful, he looked to be only fifteen or sixteen years old. He had probably taken the Youth Retaining Pill earlier.

Han Jue didn’t think too much about it. Even if Murong Qi wanted to eat the Ancient Spiritual Ginseng, he wouldn’t succeed as a Golden Core cultivator.

Besides…

Xun Chang’an was so ugly, who would have the appetite to eat him?

Han Jue started to think hard about how to make the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger stronger.

As he passed by the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain, Murong Qi suddenly asked, “Is this mountain also from the Jade Pure Sect?”

The others were also watching because the Spirit Qi in this mountain was extremely abundant.

“Yes, this is the Jade Pure Sect’s Deity Slaying Elder’s mountain. In the future, you are not allowed to trespass. Otherwise, you will be expelled from the sect.” Guan Yougang nodded. He looked at the immortal mountain with reverence.

“It’s here. What I seek must be on this mountain,” Murong Qi thought silently.

Since birth, he had an extraordinary intuition that could help him find many fortuitous encounters.

He had been to the outer sect of the Jade Pure Sect before. Now, the sect was famous in Great Yan. He didn’t dare to barge in, so he found the place where the sect specially recruited individual cultivators and signed up to join.

“Is Deity Slaying Elder accepting disciples?” Murong Qi asked.

Guan Yougang snorted. “Well, yes, but we can’t disturb him. Previously, a monk knelt on the mountain for five years before succeeding.”

The itinerant cultivators were shocked upon hearing this.

Kneel for five years?

Such determination!

Murong Qi took this matter to heart.

The group moved around the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain and flew to the main peak.

Under the Fusang Tree.

Xun Chang’an suddenly opened his eyes. He patted his chest, secretly puzzled.

“Why do I feel uneasy…”

This was the first time he felt this way. Was he possessed?

Xun Chang’an couldn’t help but become nervous. He checked his cultivation technique to see if he had practiced it wrong.

…

Two months later.

The sky was filled with purple light again, shocking the world.

Again?

That’s right!

With his top-notch Sword Dao comprehension, Han Jue entered the Sword Dao River again. The world also produced strange phenomena.

The Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger, although a finger technique, was essentially a sword technique. It was very similar to the Unparalleled Finger Divine Sword. Using the finger as a sword, it shot out sword Qi.

He came to the Sword Dao River again and looked at the figures that he had surpassed one by one. Han Jue wasn’t surprised but rather nervous.

Would he encounter that mysterious existence again?

Not able to control his consciousness, Han Jue could only watch.

The Sword Dao River was bright. Han Jue vaguely saw some memories of the sword cultivators, but they flashed past and he didn’t see them clearly.

After a while, a figure in front suddenly stopped.

Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat.

It was the same guy again!

Doesn’t he cultivate? Is he always guarding the Sword Dao River?

The figure was covered in sword light, making it difficult to see his true appearance. He turned to look at Han Jue and said, “It’s you again!”

Han Jue said carefully, “I’m already at the Grand Unity area? I didn’t mean to offend you, but I can’t stop myself. Help me stop. Just don’t hurt me.”

The mysterious sword cultivator was silent.

An invisible force made him unable to move forward.

Han Jue waited nervously.

“Strange, you don’t have an illustrious identity from your previous life. How can you have such Sword Dao comprehension?” the mysterious sword cultivator asked in surprise.

Han Jue answered, “Everything has a beginning. Perhaps I will become someone’s illustrious past life identity in the future.”

The mysterious sword cultivator did not reply.

Three breaths later, the mysterious sword cultivator waved his hand and said, “The profundity of Grand Unity is not something that ordinary people can touch. Be careful not to suffer a backlash. Go back.”

Boom!

Han Jue felt dizzy.

He opened his eyes again and saw that he had returned to the Connate Cave Abode.

Han Jue touched his chin as he wondered. Why did he keep meeting that fellow? Did he have nothing to do all day?

Han Jue began the simulation trial and raised Xiao Yao’s cultivation level to the third level of the Body Integration Realm.

With the enhanced Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger, Han Jue instantly killed him.

What a pity.

Xiao Yao was still a little weak. Han Jue suddenly wished that a ninth-stage Body Integration Realm cultivator could sneak into the Jade Pure Sect. Only then could he verify how powerful his Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger was. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At the same time, the phenomenon in the sky disappeared.

However, the discussions of the cultivation world and dynasties did not stop.

In the cultivation world, even powerful cultivators of the older generation stood up and said that a golden age of geniuses was coming!

This was the third heavenly phenomenon so far!

In the eyes of the cultivators, it was impossible for all three times to be because of the same person.

As a result, Han Jue alone set off a golden age of geniuses and elites!

Han Jue quickly entered cultivation.

A year later, someone appeared in front of the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain and knelt in front of the stone tablet.

It was none other than the reincarnation of Profound Truth Divine Emperor, Murong Qi.

After staying in the Jade Pure Sect for a year, Murong Qi had not thought of a way to ascend the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain. However, every time he looked at it, his heart would throb. It caused him to have a strong urge to go up the mountain. In the end, he decided to follow Guan Yougang’s method to become a disciple.

He had to sneak into the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain first!

Murong Qi knelt in front of the stone tablet and began to kowtow.

Han Jue was focused on cultivation and didn’t notice him.

Xun Chang’an noticed him very quickly. After all, Murong Qi had followed his example.

After Murong Qi knelt for a month, Xun Chang’an descended the mountain and stood in the array formation, smiling at him.

This person looks pretty good, Xun Chang’an silently thought.

As Murong Qi kowtowed, he noticed Xun Chang’an’s arrival.

He frowned and thought, “This person is so ugly.”

Xun Chang’an’s ugliness made Murong Qi feel a little nauseous. However, for some reason, he felt that it was this person who attracted him.

The two feelings intertwined in Murong Qi’s heart, creating strange sparks.

Could this person be the Deity Slaying Elder?

Wasn’t the Deity Slaying Elder supposed to be good-looking?

He will bring me great opportunities?

Suppressing the discomfort in his heart, Murong Qi gritted his teeth and said, “Senior, please accept me as your disciple!”
