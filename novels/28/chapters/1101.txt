Chapter 1104 Killing God and Virtuous Sage

Han Jue, who had released the malice in his heart, felt annoyed upon seeing the figures standing at the end of the void in all directions. He waved his right hand, and the bodies and souls of those figures were all destroyed.

They didn’t even have time to scream!

These ancient giants who controlled the world in Shi Tian’s domain were helpless in front of Han Jue.

It was boring.

Han Jue was neither happy nor sad as he continued forward.

He prepared to travel the various Great Dao Worlds and kill. His ferocious reputation became stronger and stronger.

[Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable sent you a dream. Do you accept?]

Han Jue ignored the notification and continued forward.

Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was furious. He wanted to ignore his reputation and forcefully move Han Jue out. However, he failed. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Impossible…”

Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was moved and instantly guessed

the other party’s identity.

Dao Creator!

However, the other party’s aura was

unfamiliar to him. He couldn’t see through it and could not deduce its origin at all.

This was different from the feeling brought by the Ninth Chaos, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, the Chaotic Consciousness, the Formless Transcendent Deity, and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity.

Furthermore, doing this…

Dark Forbidden Lord?!

Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was shocked by his guess. If it was really the Dark Forbidden Lord, he was not someone he could deal with.

He immediately went to find the Ninth Chaos.

A huge tree stood on a floating land in the depths of the blank domain. There were many branches and every leaf had a space-time dimension that seemed to be covered in water droplets.

The Ninth Chaos meditated quietly under the tree. Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction

Venerable had just left.

The Ninth Chaos dispersed the mist and

revealed his true body. His figure was human, but his face was extremely strange. His skin was pale and bloodless. He had no facial features. The slightly raised part of his face looked like his mouth and nose. His

waterfall-like long hair scattered behind his black robe.

A shadow appeared. It looked extremely similar to the Ninth Chaos. He stared at it and

asked, “Can’t you break through yet? The situation in the Chaos is becoming more and

more chaotic. Another Dao Creator has appeared. The situation is not good.” This shadow was the First Chaos’ will.

The Ninth Chaos sighed. “My cultivation level can’t increase. I need an opportunity if I want to break through. Logically speaking, I can directly break through to a higher realm after reaching the perfected minor realm, but I failed. If the Endless Era still doesn’t work, there might not be a higher realm at all.”

The First Chaos was silent.

After a long while…

The First Chaos asked again, “How can you clean up the mess if there’s no higher realm?

Dao Creators can’t kill each other.”

“Then, we can only use the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity to suppress them. If even I can’t break through, it’s impossible for Divine Might to break through. He’s too

young. The other Dao Creators have already reached the end. What makes me feel threatened are the Dark Forbidden Lord and Divine Might’s Dao Field. The Dark Forbidden Lord only dares to curse, which means that

he’s not strong enough. Divine Might’s Dao Field can isolate my prying. Furthermore, I can’t barge in. There’s actually such an existence. I can’t figure it out.”

The Ninth Chaos had witnessed Han Jue transmigrating from the Eighth Chaos to the reincarnation of the current Chaos and could confirm that he had no deeper background.

Therefore, he thought that the Dao Field was

a Supreme Treasure and not a manifestation of Han Jue’s strength.

It was as if a Sage felt that it was impossible

for a mortal without an illustrious previous life to attain the Dao at birth.

The First Chaos didn’t say anything else. He could only believe the Ninth Chaos.

If even the Ninth Chaos could not see through it, he naturally could not resolve the problem.

Primordial Chaos.

Xing Hongxuan rode a cloud and landed in

front of a hall.

Three words were carved on the plaque of the palace-

Ming Ji Palace.

“Little girl, come out and die!” Xing Hongxuan shouted proudly. As soon as she

finished speaking, figures appeared and surrounded her.

These were all Goddess Ming Ji’s personal guards. The Primordial cultivators who belonged to Han Huang did not dare to stop

her, so they let her in.

“Wait.”

Goddess Ming Ji’s voice floated over and

stopped the personal guards who were about

to attack.

The door to Ming Ji Palace opened and the dignified Goddess Ming Ji walked over. The personal guards made way for the two

women.

Goddess Ming Ji said expressionlessly, “I

should call you Mother. Now that I’m married to my husband, we’re naturally family. Mother, are you still calculative about the

past?”

Xing Hongxuan smiled. “Didn’t you want to

kill me? Don’t you feel awkward calling me Mother now?”!

“Then what do you want?”

“I want to kill you too.” “Hehe, do you have the ability? Let’s go. I

won’t pursue this matter on account of my husband.”

“The marriage has to be approved by the

parents. Have we agreed to this marriage?” “You… Can you control my husband?” “I can’t control him, but I can control you.”

Goddess Ming Ji was furious. She shouted, “Then come and control me!” With a thought, Goddess Ming Ji’s hair

quickly turned white. Her skin shriveled and her vitality flowed out extremely quickly.

“You…”

Goddess Ming Ji’s eyes widened and she tried

to mobilize her Dharmic powers. She wanted

to stop the abnormality in her body, but she failed. The surrounding personal guards were also shocked. Goddess Ming Ji was a Great Dao Sage. How could she be so easily affected? They didn’t even see how the other party did

it.

Xing Hongxuan smiled proudly. “Will Huang’er still like you if I make you lose your ten million years of beauty?” With that, she turned around and left.

“Catch her!” Goddess Ming Ji shouted crazily. The personal guards used their Mystical Powers one after another. They didn’t dare to

approach and wanted to suppress Xing Hongxuan remotely.

However, they were suddenly reduced to

ashes just as they made their move, their bodies and souls destroyed. Xing Hongxuan didn’t say anything and left.

Goddess Ming Ji was stunned when she saw this.

Xing Hongxuan was not so terrifying the last time she fought the Heavenly Dao. She even felt that Xing Hongxuan was even more terrifying than her husband. She was unfathomable and unstoppable. Why was this happening?

In Shi Tian’s domain.

Han Jue was suddenly tired of it as he swept

around and killed countless unpleasant living beings.

He retracted his malice and began to magnify

his kindness.

Thereafter, he wandered around Shi Tian’s

domain again. He would help whenever he encountered unfair and unjust things. From the Great Dao Supremes to the mortals, he no

longer killed. Even when facing the perpetrator, he only warned and taught them a lesson.

Year after year passed. Millions of years passed quickly. Han Jue’s actions in Shi Tian spread to all

living beings. He was called a Virtuous Sage.

it

As for the legend of Killing God Shi Tian, began to fade. No one dared to take revenge on him. Killing God Shi Tian and the Virtuous Sage were completely different people. Slowly, Han Jue obtained the respect of all

living beings in Shi Tian. Statues of him were erected in all worlds.

Han Jue came to the palace where Shi Tian’s

clone was. Shi Tian’s clone had nearly 800 trillion years of strength. Previously, the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable had been destroyed by Han Jue. In order to maintain the situation, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable had no choice but to create a new

one.

This clone was still named Immeasurable Destruction Venerable. “Now, tell me, should I kill or help Shi Tian?”

Han Jue’s voice floated into the ears of the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, startling him so much that he opened his

eyes.

He immediately stood up in fear upon seeing him.
