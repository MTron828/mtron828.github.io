Chapter 984 Chaos

A hundred thousand Destruction Authority Generals!

Dao Sovereign and the other three were moved. Just one made them shiver. How strong were a hundred thousand Destruction Authority Generals?

They were filled with fear.

At first, they worked with the Number One Deity because he was stupid. However, as time passed, they could no longer see through him. Now, they discovered that their strength was far inferior to the Number One Deity. This was not good!

The power of the Destruction Authority Generals that filled the sky formed a darkness that covered the sky and the earth, oppressive and terrifying

The Number One Deity looked at Dao Sovereign. “I have such power. If you can rope in the geniuses of the Chaos, you will definitely be able to overturn the Chaos in the future. I promise that after overturning the Chaos, the Consciousnessless Great Dao World and the Heavenly Dao will definitely not be enemies. You’re still the Realm Lords of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World. I want the Consciousnessless Great Dao World to obtain freedom and cultivate in peace.

“I don’t care about power, but the Chaos suppressed the Consciousnessless Great Dao World, causing my cultivation to be severely obstructed. I’m the first living being in the Consciousnessless Great Dao World. My fate is closely related to it.”

The Number One Deity’s tone was very calm, but in his opinion, he was already extremely sincere.

Zhao Xuanyuan spread his hands and smiled. “You’re right. We think so, too. Call back these Destruction Authority Generals first.”

He pretended to be calm but was sweating internally.

The Number One Deity immediately waved his hand. All the Destruction Authority Generals burrowed underground again and disappeared, leaving only dust in the sky.

The Number One Deity exchanged pleasantries with them before leaving.

After his aura completely vanished, Zhao Xuanyuan heaved a sigh of relief and muttered, “This fellow is becoming more and more unfathomable.”

Dao Sovereign’s expression was solemn.

He wondered if his Ultimate Defense had a chance of winning against a hundred thousand Destruction Authority Generals.

Jiang Yi snorted. “I keep feeling that he has ill intentions.”

Lao Dan smiled. “No matter what, we are his saviors. He has never hurt us and even gave us such a huge opportunity.”

He did not think so, but he was afraid that the Number One Deity would hear him, so he deliberately said good things. Dao Sovereign sat down and said, “Continue cultivating. We both control the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. We can’t be left behind!”

Zhao Xuanyuan’s expression turned ugly when he thought of the hundred thousand Destruction Authority Generals.

He thought that he had already become extremely strong, but he was way too inferior compared to the Number One Deity.

He shivered just thinking about being surrounded by a hundred thousand Destruction Authority Generals

At this moment, he suddenly thought of his master, Han Jue.

What was Han Jue’s mentality when he faced twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals?

Sigh.

He wondered how strong his master was now.

Zhao Xuanyuan fell into a daze.

Han Jue started to check his emails after observing the Chaos.

He discovered that Dao Sovereign and the other three appeared the most. They were all about opportunities. It seemed that they were really about to soar.

ere

Apart from Dao Sovereign and the other three, Han Tuo, Han Huang, Jiang Jueshi, Han Yu, Qin Ling, and the other descendants and disciples also began to frequently obtain opportunities and increase their cultivation.

Han Jue thought for a moment and teleported to the second Dao Field.

Dao Comprehension Sword and Li Yao were very happy to see him and immediately surrounded him.

However, Han Jue didn’t chat with them. He quickly gathered all the Fiendcelestials in front of the Daoist temple.

“Regarding the Chaotic Assembly, does anyone want to participate?” Han Jue asked. Since it was a banquet he organized, he would naturally make it bigger.

Guan Bubai was the first to speak. “I want to participate!”

The other Fiendcelestials agreed and looked excited.

They had become warlike after becoming Chaotic Fiendcelestials. It was indeed boring to stay in the Dao Field all day.

Han Jue smiled. “Those who want to go out, raise your hands. I’ll send you out now.”

With that said, most of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials raised their hands. They couldn’t hold it in anymore.

Han Jue sent them out, leaving only the Black Hell Chicken, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, the crimson fox, and the Dao Field guard, Dong Zhuo.

Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword did not want to go out, either.

Han Jue looked at the Black Hell Chicken and asked, “Aren’t you going out? You’re the only one who has never left the Dao Field. Now that I’ve already gone out, aren’t you going?”

The current Black Hell Chicken was like a black phoenix. It was extremely handsome and stood as tall as an adult.

“What’s the point of going out? My cultivation level can still increase. There’s no need to go out!” the Black Hell Chicken said proudly. The Chaotic Heavenly Dog followed suit.

Han Jue smiled. “Should I send you back to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and find you a Black Hell Phoenix to marry?”

“No, no!”

The Black Hell Chicken hurriedly shook its head.

The Chaotic Heavenly Dog said, “Master, it had such thoughts before, but it was dumped, so it made up its mind not to find a Dao Companion anymore.”

Han Jue raised his eyebrows. Such a story had happened in the Hundred Peak Immortal River?

The Black Hell Chicken said angrily, “What are you shouting for? Who gave you the right to speak?”

The Chaotic Heavenly Dog could only shut up.

Han Jue looked at the crimson fox next.

The crimson fox was a little fox he had met when he descended into the mortal world to train. They had known each other for about the same time as he met Qingluan’er. After that, it had been cultivating with him and had never asked for anything or complained.

“I don’t want to go out, either. I’ve just attained the Great Dao and want to continue cultivating to attain the Great Dao Supreme Realm. I don’t want to waste time outside.”

There were already ten Great Dao Sages in the second Dao Field. Because they were all Chaotic Fiendcelestials, the earlier they became Chaotic Fiendcelestials, the higher their cultivation level.

The crimson fox was one of the earliest personal disciples to become a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.

“Then cultivate well. I’ll bring you to watch the commotion when the Chaotic Assembly begins.” Han Jue waved his sleeve.

The Black Hell Chicken, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, and the crimson fox immediately thanked him.

Chaos ensued outside after Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple. The Black Hell Chicken was furious and was settling scores with the Chaotic Heavenly Dog. Han Jue didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he chatted with Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword.

He had already given them status, so it was not easy for them to meet. He had to nurture their feelings. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As they chatted, he realized that something was wrong with the two women.

They were distracted during the conversation, but they looked at him with an extremely passionate gaze.

With Han Jue’s cultivation, he could naturally tell what they were thinking.

“Forget it. I see that you don’t want to chat. Who wants to go outside first?” Han Jue shook his head and laughed.

Dao Comprehension Sword giggled. “Can I stay?”

Li Yao blushed.

Han Jue was stunned. He had never experienced this before. Should he try?

He was tempted.

It was fifty years later when he returned to the third Dao Field.

Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus in a good mood.

Han Ling opened his eyes and frowned. “Father, why do you have two different feminine auras?”

Han Jue said, “Your Fourth Mother and Fifth Mother.”

Han Ling was enlightened and did not ask further.

Han Jue didn’t cultivate immediately but looked at Hong Jun outside the Dao Field.

Hong Jun’s potential was outstanding. He had already attained the Dao after five hundred thousand years.

The current Hong Jun had already established a lineage in the universe of stars and accepted many disciples. He was conferred the title of Sage by all living beings. As for Liu Bei, he hid behind the scenes and no longer did everything himself.
