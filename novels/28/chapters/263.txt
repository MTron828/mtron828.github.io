Chapter 264 Dual Prodigies of the Human School, Su Qi’s Determination

Han Jue became nervous when the Heavenly Emperor suddenly smiled.

What a cunning expression!

Could it be that the Heavenly Emperor was plotting to make him work? Han Jue sighed inside.

The Heavenly Emperor stared at him with a burning gaze and asked, “Is your loyalty to the Heavenly Court still there?”

“The Heavenly Court is my home. If I’m invincible in the myriad worlds, I will definitely send the Heavenly Court to the top!”

“Hmph, but not now, right?”

“Cough cough, no. I’m too weak now. The other immortals who can contribute to the Heavenly Court can also do it. I want to become the future pillar of the Heavenly Court.”

“Hmph. From today onwards, I won’t interfere if an Immortal Emperor attacks the Reroll World. However, if they exceed the Emperor Realm, I won’t let you die.”

The Heavenly Emperor snorted, looking as if he had already seen through him.

Han Jue hurriedly nodded. He could only agree.

The Heavenly Emperor sized him up and said, “Perhaps you can reach the Zenith Heaven Realm.”

Zenith Heaven!

Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat. My goal has been discovered?

He asked curiously, “Are there many Zenith Heavens in the Immortal World?”

The Heavenly Emperor replied, “Ever since the last calamity ended, there has been no new Zenith Heaven. Perhaps one will appear in the next calamity. The two supreme prodigies of the Human School are already close to it. If you’re able to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm after the next calamity, I will do my best to protect you.”

Although the Heavenly Court was afraid of the Immeasurable Calamity, they were not in despair. They had already survived several calamities!

Human School?

Han Jue blinked and asked curiously, “Is the Human School the strongest among the three schools of the Dao Sect?”

The Heavenly Emperor shook his head. “In terms of power, they’re the weakest. Ever since the Divine Investiture Calamity ended, the Human School only nurtured two disciples in each generation. As long as one disciple dies, the other disciple must also die. However, after all the disciples of the first generation die, they will nurture the next generation. In terms of talent, the disciples of the Human School have the highest potential.”

Eh?

Live and die together?

Two disciples in the sect at any one time?

What kind of ridiculous rule was this?

Han Jue was shocked.

Wasn’t this elite path too narrow? Weren’t they afraid of accidentally destroying the sect’s lineage?

“By the way, Your Majesty, do you know Pan Xin?” Han Jue asked curiously.

The Heavenly Emperor frowned. “Where did you learn this name?”

Han Jue didn’t hide anything and told him about his encounter with Pan Xin.

The Heavenly Emperor’s expression turned solemn. “Don’t have too deep of a relationship with this person. If you offend him, I won’t be able to protect you. Furthermore, he’s being targeted by an extremely terrifying mighty figure and can’t even protect himself. Being on good terms with him won’t end well.”

Han Jue asked in surprise, “Is there a higher hierarchy in this world than you, the Demon Emperor, and the Buddha?”

“Hmph, you’ll understand when you reach the Deity Realm!”

“Is His Majesty at the Deity Realm?”

“Deity Realm? Hehe.”

The Heavenly Emperor shook his head and laughed before disappearing.

Han Jue showed a frown.

This laughter… Could it be that the Heavenly Emperor was at the Zenith Heaven Realm?

Han Jue was secretly shocked. He really couldn’t offend him.

Then, he returned to the Connate Cave Abode and continued cultivating.

It had taken him nearly three years to comprehend the Supreme Dao technique. He had to continue cultivating.

He wanted to break through to the Rank Two Immortal Emperor Realm as soon as possible!

In a dark palace, Su Qi was meditating.

Ever since he had escaped the pursuit of the Great Desolate Sacred Dynasty, he had been cultivating in seclusion in the Divine Palace and did not interact with others.

A figure suddenly appeared in front of him. It was the Sword God Emperor. The Sword God Emperor said expressionlessly, “Su Qi, you have to go on a mission next.”

Seeing Su Qi gave him a headache.

As his cultivation level increased, this fellow’s bad luck also increased rapidly.

Even Grand Unity Golden Immortals might not be able to withstand it.

When this fellow reached the Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm, perhaps even Immortal Emperors would be harmed.

The Jie School was really detestable. They always nurtured trouble!

Su Qi opened his eyes and asked curiously, “What mission?”

“Kill the Demon Saints. Do you dare?”

The Sword God Emperor looked down at Su Qi and deliberately provoked him.

Su Qi said, “I don’t dare.”

The Sword God Emperor fell silent.

Su Qi cursed silently. Do you think I’m stupid? Kill the Demon Saints?

Master isn’t secretly protecting me. Won’t I die if I go?

Anyway, Master asked me to stay in the Divine Palace. I’m not going anywhere! Ever since Su Qi was imprisoned by the Grand Desolate Sacred Dynasty, he finally understood Han Jue’s efforts.

Without absolutely powerful cultivation, he really couldn’t wander around!

“Go. If you’re afraid of the Demon Saints, go kill the Demon Kings.” The Sword God Emperor suppressed his anger.

Su Qi shook his head. “No, it’s too dangerous. I want to cultivate well. Isn’t the Divine Palace very tolerant toward disciples? There’s no need to carry out missions unless they’ve already finished their apprenticeship.”

The reason why there were so many prodigies in the Divine Palace was because of the rules. Unless the Divine Palace made arrangements, the disciples had to leave the sect before they could go out and do missions.

Su Qi had already been sent out by the Sword God Emperor once. This time, he felt that his rejection was very reasonable.

Even if he was a disciple recruited by the Sword God Emperor, he couldn’t forcefully expel him.

The Sword God Emperor frowned.

He didn’t say anything else and turned to leave.

Su Qi heaved a sigh of relief and continued cultivating

I’m already about to reach the Grand Unity True Immortal Realm. If Master knows, he will definitely be happy. No one in the sect should be able to catch up to me. Su Qi thought proudly.

He suddenly missed the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.

When he became a Golden Immortal, he would return. At that time, he would give his master a surprise. In the future, he would be the one supporting the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain!

Another ten years passed.

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the Demon Emperor.

There was only one target left on his daily mission. Han Jue felt that it was difficult for him to curse the Demon Emperor to death with his cultivation, but at least it could annoy him.

While cursing, he checked his emails.

[Your good friend Jiang Yi was attacked by a mighty figure and his body was destroyed. Fortunately, a mighty figure saved him.)

[Your good friend Zhang Guxing has returned to his body. His Sword Dao Heart has grown.]

The Heavenly Court and the Demon Court really fought!

Han Jue noticed that Zhang Guxing had regained his body and immediately checked his interpersonal relationships.

Zhang Guxing, Rank Five Immortal Emperor!

So impressive? Han Jue was shocked. He had already felt that his brother was not simple, but he didn’t expect him to be so ridiculously strong.

Was Zhang Guxing going to rise up?

It must be because of me!

Han Jue didn’t curse Yu Tianbao to death directly, but he had accumulated too many curses in the past. He probably had a mental breakdown already.

Because Yu Tianbao didn’t have any hatred towards him, Han Jue was too embarrassed to curse him to death.

If Yu Tianbao wanted to kill Zhang Guxing, he would have died long ago. He was probably obstructed in the Divine Palace.

He should let Zhang Guxing kill this person personally! Han Jue thought silently and continued to check his emails. Almost all the Heavenly Generals of the Heavenly Court were attacked. It was quite a commotion. Han Jue felt a sense of danger. He had to hurry up and break through to the Rank Two Immortal Emperor Realm!

At this moment, Dao Comprehension Sword walked in and stopped in front of him. She said carefully, “Master, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog is back.”
