Chapter 1137 Fang Liang’s Choice

Han Jue was satisfied when he saw Chu Xiaoqi’s expression. He had not nurtured him in vain. What a good grandson.

He smiled and said, “Go. I really want you to go this time. What you said just now. Everyone has their own life. You have yours too. I’m only a passerby in your life.”

Chu Xiaoqi was silent, his heart filled with reluctance.

Han Jue reached out and touched his head. “Xiaoqi, the path of cultivation is extremely long. One day, a thousand years will only be a day for you. At that time, when you look back, your mental state will be completely different.”

Chu Xiaoqi couldn’t help but ask, “Is this your current state of mind?”

“That’s right.”

“How old are you? Grandpa, are you a very powerful immortal in the Immortal World?”

“I don’t belong to the Immortal World. Actually, I’m not an immortal. As for how old I am, I’m actually not that old.”

Han Jue smiled gently. These words made Chu Xiaoqi think that he was a land deity traveling the mortal world.

The grandfather and grandson chatted for a long time. Finally, under Han Jue’s wave of the hand, Chu Xiaoqi was expelled by the rules of the mortal world and began to ascend.

He, who was constantly rising into the sky, looked down and did not see his grandfather. He did not come out to send him off.

For some reason, Chu Xiaoqi suddenly felt sorrow and confusion.

His family had long turned to dust. Now that he had bid farewell to his grandfather, he was really wandering the world alone.

What should he do in the future? Where should he go?

He suddenly thought of Han Tuo, that firm and domineering figure. Perhaps that was his goal, the man he wanted to become!

Chu Xiaoqi no longer acted like a child. He looked up at the sky with anticipation.

Immortal World, I want to see how exciting you are!

After he ascended, Han Jue also quietly left the villa. The villa returned to its ghostly appearance.

After more than a thousand years of

accumulation, the ghost aura of the villa was even stronger. It was definitely a dangerous place to the mortal world.

…

Han Jue returned to the third Dao Field.

Many disciples were still cultivating near the

Daoist temple group. Now that the three Dao Fields were connected, the disciples who could come to a radius of billions of kilometers of the Dao temple were all people with high status in the Hidden Sect.

Han Jue quietly returned to his Daoist temple. Shan’e had never returned since he went out. It seemed that he had been holding it in in the

past.

Sigh, these disciples were like his children.

They rarely returned after going out.

Han Jue sat for a while before calling Fang Liang in.

Fang Liang had been waiting for him outside for hundreds of years.

Fang Liang entered the temple and bowed. After sitting down, he said, “Grandmaster, I feel that time and space might have 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

changed.”

Han Jue asked, “Why?”

“I often study space-time and know its

changes. Recently, I’ve clearly felt that I’ve

forgotten something. There are also fluctuations in the space-time rules. Someone

must have tampered with space-time. I’m worried that it will affect us,” Fang Liang said

worriedly, but his words made Han Jue think highly of him.

Thinking about it carefully, Fang Liang had traveled through space and time earlier than

Ji Xianshen.

However, the fact that Fang Liang could sense

the Origin Space-time proved that his talent

was very impressive.

Even a Great Dao Supreme couldn’t sense the Origin Space-time. Only a Dao Creator could

do it. Speaking of which, Fang Liang and Ji Xianshen were once the best brothers. Later,

because of the battle of the Heavenly Dao’s Immeasurable Calamity, the two of them became strangers for hundreds of millions of

years.

He did not expect that after Ji Xianshen disappeared, the only person who cared about him was this brother who had turned against

him.

Han Jue said, “That’s right. This is indeed the case. A disciple touched the Origin Space-time and was devoured by karma. Everyone forgot about him.”

Fang Liang frowned.

Han Jue didn’t disturb his thoughts. After a long time, Fang Liang asked, “Is that

person important to me?”

“Is this question meaningful?” “I’m uneasy. If he’s important to me, I’ll

definitely save him. By severing karma like this, he should have no choice. Ancestor, please guide me.”

Han Jue looked at him meaningfully and said,

“We can only investigate if we go to the Origin Space-time, but I don’t know how to save him. You were once the best brothers, but later, you broke up. You didn’t get back together until he disappeared.’

He told the truth. Fang Liang would decide on his own.

Fang Liang frowned even more. The Daoist temple fell silent. Han Jue’s gaze passed through the Dao Field

and landed on the blank domain.

After the Chaos shattered, the worlds of the Chaos had already dispersed. It could even be said that most of the worlds of the Endless

Era had evolved from the Chaotic World. Han Jue discovered that his children were estranged. They hadn’t interacted for a long time. Speaking of which, the most filial was the

youngest son he did not think highly of, Han Yunjin.

Han Yunjin’s potential was the worst, but he

would return every once in a while to visit his

elders. It was the same for his brothers and sisters. However, other than Han Ling, Han Tuo, Han Huang, and Han Qing’er did not care much about him.

The current Han Yunjin was still struggling at the Great Dao Sage Realm. He had only reached it with the support of the Hidden Sect. With his potential, he might never have the chance to become a Great Dao Supreme. Han Jue suddenly wondered if he should show him some concern.

Fang Liang looked up and said, “I choose to save him. Grandmaster, please guide me where the Origin Space-time is.” “Right now. I’m already prepared!”

Han Jue waved his hand and pointed, sending Fang Liang into the Origin Space-time. It didn’t matter if Fang Liang could succeed.

That was his choice.

The Origin Space-time erased all karma. The

soul fragment that Ji Xianshen had left with Han Jue had already disappeared, which meant that Fang Liang could die.

Han Jue was already indifferent to life and death. He couldn’t protect all the disciples forever. He was already invincible. If he was biased like this, the Hidden Sect would

dominate the Endless Era. He would suffer a backlash sooner or later. Any unification would end eventually. Han Jue had already jumped out of the Hidden Sect and wouldn’t be especially biased. The essence of the current Hidden Sect had

already been disbanded, but with its soul around, all the personal disciples had their own forces. They would fight sooner or later. Han Jue stood up and disappeared from the Daoist temple.

Heavenly Dao.

Ever since the Endless Era began, the Heavenly Dao had completely soared. Without the suppression of the Great Dao Divine Spirit, the Heavenly Dao could develop without restraint. Now, it was still dominated by Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, but its control was still in Han Jue’s hands. Many of the

upper echelons of the Heavenly Dao were his

slaves. Han Yunjin had also been promoted to one of the most powerful Heavenly Dao Sages. At this moment, he was playing with a mirror

in his Daoist temple. Many images flashed in the mirror and reflected in his eyes.

Han Jue quietly appeared behind him. The

situation of various descendants of the Han family appeared in the mirror.

It turned out that Han Yunjin’s favorite thing was to screen the bloodlines passed down in the Han family and choose those with outstanding potential to nurture. Previously, Chen Jue, who had obtained the Creation Heaven’s Chosen, had received his secret help, so he disdained the immortals.

Han Yunjin nodded from time to time and smiled in satisfaction.

Han Jue sighed in his heart. This kid really

didn’t have the bearing of an expert at all. However, this was also good. His children all wanted to be the strongest. Wouldn’t they have to treat Han Jue as their enemy in the future?
