Chapter 1032 Shi Tian

“Regardless of whether it’s true or not, raising my cultivation level is the most important. The Chaos won’t die yet,” Han Jue said softly and calmly.

Huang Zuntian thought of many things.

Fifty million years ago, the mysterious existence of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World attacked the Chaos and was quickly suppressed.

How many unimaginable transcendent existences were hidden above the Chaos?

Han Jue and Huang Zuntian chatted for a while before removing the dream.

Opening his eyes, Han Jue looked at Han Bashen of the Daoist temple next door. He had already become a Great Dao Sage.

Han Jue said, “Ling’er, I gave Han Bashen the authority to enter the simulation trial, but you have to teach him.”

Han Ling opened her eyes and immediately went to do it.

Han Jue looked at the bottom of the Chaos. The evil devils formed by the Ninth Chaos’ mental demon had already dispersed and increased wantonly. The Great Dao Divine Spirits couldn’t kill them all. Han Tuo, Yi Tian, and the other Divine Punishers had also gone to eliminate the devils. The situation was becoming more and more serious.

The Chaotic Assembly was in another 200,000 years. It was estimated that one of the missions would be to eliminate devils.

Han Jue created a clone. He would bring his Dao Companion and disciples to the Chaotic Assembly when the time came. His main body would continue cultivating.

He entered seclusion again after doing all of this.

On the other side, Han Bashen began to spar with Han Ling in the simulation trial.

Han Ling deliberately sparred with him first. Han Bashen was very excited. He could finally fight after cultivating for so long.

He also wanted to test Ancestor Han Ling’s strength!

Then…

Han Bashen woke up and fearfully looked at Han Ling.

He did not expect the gentle-looking Ancestor Han Ling to be so terrifying in battle. She was like a completely different person.

Han Ling smiled and said, “Compared to me, you’re still far inferior. However, you can spar with others. The simulation trial contains all living beings. You can choose anyone to spar with, regardless of realm.”

Han Bashen took a deep breath and nodded. Then, he entered the simulation trial and began to fight other opponents.

He was looking for a Great Dao Sage. He had no intention of torturing anyone below the Great Dao Sage Realm.

Soon, he was immersed.

Several days later, he established absolute confidence.

The reason Ancestor Han Ling could defeat him was definitely that her cultivation realm was far superior to his.

He was invincible among those of the same realm!

He suddenly had a bold thought.

How strong was the progenitor, Han Jue?

He immediately chose to challenge him.

At the bottom of the Chaos, Ten Absolute City.

Ten Absolute City became lively again due to the second Chaotic Assembly’s arrival. Continuous booms rang outside the city as the mighty figures fought the evil devils.

For millions of years, the bottom of the Chaos had been filled with mysterious evil devils. These evil devils were extremely strong and liked to destroy and kill. Many geniuses and mighty figures had fallen under their claws.

Han Jue’s clone brought his trusted aides over. As usual, the disciples of the Hidden Sect and the Heavenly Dao gathered together. Dao Sovereign and the other three also came. Many people had not seen each other for tens of millions of years and were exchanging pleasantries and asking about the past.

The atmosphere was lively. Although the disciples of the Hidden Sect had always been on their own, their relationship had not been sorted out because of the Myriad Worlds Projection. They would only stop when necessary and never kill even if there were conflicts.

Of course, the main reason they could be harmonious was that Han Jue could suppress them.

Han Qing’er asked after looking around, “Where’s my second brother?”

Yi Tian smiled. “Your second brother is not interested in this Assembly. He’s already at the Eternal Peak and can’t participate anymore. He’s currently in the south of the Chaos preparing to challenge an ancient ferocious beast. That ferocious beast has existed since the birth of the Chaos and contains the power to destroy space and time. It’s hidden between the past and the future, not the present.” Han Qing’er curled her lips, not understanding why her second brother was so warlike.

Her gaze landed on Han Yao and Han Ye. At this moment, the two of them surrounded Han Yunjin and met their ancestor.

Although many geniuses appeared in the Han family, very few were qualified to participate in the Chaotic Assembly. Han Yunjin and Han Yu had brought a few people, but they were not Great Dao Sages. Most of them had not even reached the Freedom Realm. But, Han Yao and Han Ye were true Great Dao Sages.

At this moment.

Han Ling walked over with Han Bashen following behind him.

Han Bashen was majestic like a human-shaped ferocious beast, attracting everyone’s attention.

Han Yunjin was moved when he saw him. This was his bloodline.

Han Ling immediately introduced him to everyone. The personal disciples surrounded him. The children who could cultivate beside Han Jue must have very strong potential.

Han Yao and Han Ye frowned when they saw Han Bashen.

Where did this kid come from?

On the other side, Han Jue’s clone was discussing the details of this Chaotic Assembly with the Ultimate God of Punishment.

Because of the successful outcome of the first Chaotic Assembly, the second Chaotic Assembly was even more lively. Many geniuses had appeared in the Chaos in the past 50 million years. It could be said that each generation surpassed the last. Many ancient existences also came out of seclusion to join in the fun.

This Chaotic Assembly would be even smoother without the schemes of the Number One Deity of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World.

Blank Domain.

The Holy Mother of Order and Han Huang stood side by side. The Holy Mother of Order was majestic. Han Huang looked tiny as he stood beside her, but his aura was stronger.

The two Divine Spirits looked in the same direction.

Following their gaze, a black dot appeared in the depths of the blank domain and slowly expanded.

It was a Great Dao World that was not inferior to the vastness of the Chaos.

The Holy Mother of Order said, “Do you see? This will be the prelude to the Endless Era. The two Great Dao Worlds will collide and fuse. The two giants and geniuses will fight. Those ambitious people will fight for benefits and will also begin the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Han Huang snorted. “So be it. I’ll represent the Chaos to resist all intruders.”

The Holy Mother of Order smiled. “This Great Dao World’s owner is called Shi Tian. His Great Dao World has existed the longest after the Chaos.”

“Is that the strongest Great Dao World?”

“No, a stronger Great Dao World is on the way. It will appear in a few hundred million years.”

“Holy Mother, why do I feel that you know more than the Ultimate God of Punishment? What kind of existence are you?”

Although the Holy Mother of Order was not as powerful as him, she always exuded an unfathomable aura.

The Holy Mother of Order smiled. “I’m the order of the Chaos. Han Huang, I believe that you are the Primordial Fiendcelestial. You’ll definitely create the Primordial Chaos, but you better wait until the Endless Era arrives. Otherwise, the Primordial Chaos’ power will devour the Chaos, just like how the Chaos replaced the Primordial Chaos. It will endanger all living beings in the Chaos and the Heavenly Dao.”

Han Huang was silent.

At this moment!

He suddenly looked up and saw a black light shooting over from afar. He raised his hand and grabbed it, catching a ring between his two fingers. This ring was like a crescent moon and was missing a piece, preventing it from forming a complete circle.

Han Huang frowned and asked, “What is this?”

The Holy Mother of Order said, “One of Shi Tian’s rings; he’s a warlike person. This ring can help you create a Great Dao World and increase your comprehension and creativity. However, as you die, it will absorb your power of creation and help that warlike person.

“He’s declaring war on you. Either you die and he gets your power of creation, or he dies and you get his power of creation.”
