Chapter 135 Subduing the Golden Crow, The Demon Lord Arrives

After arriving outside the cave abode, Han Jue looked up. The sun formed by the two little Golden Crows grew larger and larger.

“Are they going to descend into the mortal world?” Han Jue frowned.

Yang Tiandong, Xun Chang’an, Murong Qi, and the Black Hell Chicken were all extremely nervous.

Especially the Black Hell Chicken, because it was the one who caused this disaster!

The thought of the legendary Golden Crow descending into the mortal world terrified it.

Dao Comprehension Sword followed Han Jue out of the cave abode. She looked up and asked in surprise, “The two suns are about to fall?”

They were not the only ones. The disciples of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect also sensed that something was amiss. More and more people flew into the sky and pointed at the three suns.

Han Jue hesitated. Should he shoot a finger at the two little Golden Crows and scare them away?

Sensing that the temperature was rising, he felt that he could not wait any longer. He immediately jumped up and quickly reached the top.

He looked up and saw two huge fire ravens ramming into the sky. The True Sun Flame on their bodies grew stronger.

The Golden Crow was shaped like a fire crow. It had three legs and a wingspan of ten miles. It was very domineering, and one could not tell that it was still young.

Cracks had already appeared in the sky, and the two three-legged Golden Crows were about to charge in. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At this moment!

A line of words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue.

[Detected bearer of Connate providence, check its origin.]

Connate providence?

Han Jue immediately chose to check.

[Divine Golden Crow: Seventh level of the Mahayana Realm. Currently in its infancy stage, it was abandoned by the Golden Crow Divine Clan due to its potential. It sensed the aura of the Fusang Tree and rushed to the mortal world in order to become stronger. Due to the interference of the Heavenly Dao’s providence by the devil race, the two Golden Crows found an opportunity to forcefully enter the mortal world.]

Two identical messages appeared in front of Han Jue.

Eh?

Abandoned by the Golden Crow Divine Clan?

Han Jue caught the important information.

Since they were abandoned, would Han Jue offend the Golden Crow Divine Clan by killing them?

Not necessarily.

A clan like this definitely cared about their face. If they knew that these two had been killed by mortals, how could they not be angry?

Han Jue thought silently.

A Daoist appeared not far away. Shocked, he screamed, “Three-legged Golden Crows! Oh

no!”

He was so shocked that he vanished on the spot.

Han Jue was confused. Was this person here to be funny?

Boom!

The heavenly wall shattered like glass. The two Golden Crows immediately rushed towards Han Jue, or more accurately, towards the ground.

Han Jue shot two fingers towards the sky. Sword Qi soared into the sky. Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger!

The bodies of the two little Golden Crows were penetrated, and they let out a cry. The True Sun Flame on their bodies immediately dissipated.

If not for the Golden Crow bloodline, they would have died on the spot!

Han Jue waved his hand and used his Mystical Power, Universe in the Sleeves, to suck them into his sleeve.

Even Xuan Qingjun, who was at the eighth level of the Mahayana Realm, would be instantly killed by him, let alone the little Golden Crows, who were at the seventh level.

Although the little Golden Crows were from the Divine Clan, they were still young.

Han Jue was about to leave when a figure rushed over. It was Ji Xianshen.

“What about the two suns?” Ji Xianshen asked curiously. He was not surprised to see Han Jue.

Han Jue said calmly, “They left.”

The heavenly wall quickly recovered, as if it had not been broken.

Han Jue was curious. What was outside?

If the little Golden Crows could barge in, would the other Immortal Gods be the same?

He suddenly felt uncomfortable. The mortal world was not necessarily safe. Ji Xianshen came in front of Han Jue and carefully sized him up. His eyes burned as he said, “Are you the one who killed the Fiend Emperor? I clearly felt the sword Qi just now!”

If it was really Han Jue, he would feel better.

He finally accepted that someone was stronger than him. He didn’t want two people to be stronger than him!

Han Jue nodded and said, “This matter cannot be spread. You will still remain as the number one cultivator in the world.”

Ji Xianshen frowned and asked, “Why? Do you not cultivate for fame?”

“I cultivate for longevity.”

Hearing his reply, Ji Xianshen fell silent.

Han Jue turned around and left.

Ji Xianshen didn’t stop him. He only looked at his back with a complicated expression. [Ji Xianshen’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 3 stars]

Han Jue shook his head and laughed when he saw the notification.

He went back to the Fusang Tree.

Murong Qi was the first to ask, “Grandmaster, how’s the situation? Have you gotten rid of the Golden Crows?”

The fact that there was only one sun in the sky was enough to show the results.

The others looked at Han Jue in admiration.

Han Jue said in a low voice, “This matter can’t be made public. Just pretend that you don’t know!”

Everyone nodded.

Han Jue walked to the Fusang Tree and sat down. Then, he closed his eyes. The others didn’t dare to disturb him and could only discuss at the side.

Han Jue sent his divine sense into the small world in his sleeve. In the darkness, the two little Golden Crows squeezed together and shivered in fear.

After the True Sun Flame dissipated, they appeared pitiful and helpless.

“I’ll give you a chance. If you acknowledge me as your master, I can let you live and even become stronger,” Han Jue said.

His consciousness sent his words into the bodies of the two little Golden Crows, turning into information that they could understand.

The two Golden Crows looked at each other.

They hesitated.

Soon, they bowed their heads to Han Jue, indicating that they were willing to surrender.

Worried, Han Jue secretly placed the Six Paths Insignia on them.

He planned to observe for a while before releasing them.

The reason why he had adopted the little Golden Crows was that the Fusang Tree might attract other Golden Crows in the future. It was better to let the two abandoned Divine Golden Crows be his mounts in the future. Wouldn’t that be cool?

The matter of the Golden Crows caused a heated discussion, but as the two suns suddenly disappeared, the world quickly fell silent.

A month later.

Han Jue was certain that the intelligence of the two little Golden Crows was very low. They were like three or four-year-old children. Taking advantage of their young age, Han Jue deepened the Six Paths Insignia in their souls and controlled their lives.

The Six Paths Insignia was very hidden and difficult to discover.

After doing all this, Han Jue released them to the outside world.

The two little Golden Crows shrunk to the size of the Black Hell Chicken and excitedly flew up to the Fusang Tree. Han Jue strictly ordered them to retract their True Sun Flame, but even so, the Black Hell Chicken was still very afraid of them.

“Master… Will they eat me?” The Black Hell Chicken asked while trembling, about to cry.

Han Jue snorted. “Didn’t you summon them? From now on, you three will be companions!”

The Black Hell Chicken was on the brink of tears.

Yang Tiandong looked at the two Golden Crows and instinctively felt fear.

To the demons, the Golden Crow was a supreme bloodline. Yang Tiandong, who had the Demon Saint bloodline, was naturally afraid.

Xun Chang’an, Murong Qi, and Dao Comprehension Sword were curious.

After settling down the two little Golden Crows, Han Jue returned to the cave abode to continue cultivating. During this period, Li Qingzi and Chang Yue’er came. They were shocked to see the little Golden Crows and were even more curious about Han Jue’s cultivation level.

How strong is he? He can even tame such divine beasts!

A year later.

Amidst cultivation, Han Jue was awakened by a voice.

“I didn’t expect you to have a mistress.”

Xuan Qingjun!

Her tone was half-smiling, causing Han Jue’s heart to tighten.

He immediately spread his divine sense and found Xuan Qingjun at the foot of the mountain.

“You can leave first.”

Han Jue looked at Dao Comprehension Sword and ordered. At the same time, he used his divine sense to activate the mountain-protecting array to let Xuan Qingjun in.

Although Dao Comprehension Sword was puzzled, she still stood up obediently.

She bumped into Xuan Qingjun as soon as she walked out of the cave abode.

Xuan Qingjun ignored her and entered the cave abode.

Dao Comprehension Sword frowned. Seeing the cave abode’s stone door close, she felt inexplicably unhappy.
