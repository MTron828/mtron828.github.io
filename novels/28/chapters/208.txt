Chapter 210 Chaos in the Heavenly Court, Grand-Disciple’s Ascension

“I didn’t say that I doubted you. Why are you feeling guilty?”

Di Taibai retorted angrily. After getting closer to Han Jue, he no longer put on airs.

Han Jue asked, “What’s wrong with him?”

Di Taibai said, “This child often fights with the Heavenly Soldiers and Generals. Occasionally, he injures people too severely and offends many immortals and gods. Someone reported that he was once very close to Marshal Shen Peng.”

Han Jue said in surprise, “He has only ascended for a few years. There’s no need for him to betray us, right? As for fighting, he looked for me in the past but didn’t dare to anymore.”

Ji Xianshen was really courting death.

“His Majesty only promoted him to a Heavenly General because of you. Now that the Heavenly Court is in turmoil, His Majesty intends to eliminate the lingering forces of the former Heavenly Emperor, Hao Tian. Now that all the gods of the Heavenly Court are taking sides, Ji Xianshen might be used to distract others,” Di Taibai said solemnly.

Cleaning up Hao Tian’s old forces?

Wait!

Wasn’t Hao Tian reincarnated as Long Hao? The Heavenly Emperor doesn’t know about this?

Han Jue frowned and hesitated to mention it.

If this was revealed, would it offend Hao Tian?

The fact that the Heavenly Emperor was so wary of Hao Tian meant that he was stronger than him. He was only temporarily weakened.

The more Han Jue thought about it, the more conflicted he was.

Di Taibai asked in surprise, “What’s wrong with you? Could it be that you’re also…”

Han Jue snorted. “Yes, I’m a spy who hides in the mortal world and cultivates. I don’t bother getting close to the people in the Heavenly Court, either.”

Di Taibai shook his head and laughed. He was naturally joking.

However, he didn’t expect Han Jue to realize how abnormal he was.

Han Jue continued to ask, “Can the Heavenly Emperor stabilize the situation? There’s been a lot of unrest recently. If this time…”

Several hundred years ago, he had just undergone the Demon Saint tribulation. Now, he had also undergone the tribulation of Marshal Shen Peng. If he were to clean up Hao Tian’s old accomplices, wouldn’t he immediately collapse?

Being quick was not always a bad thing.

Di Taibai smiled and said, “Don’t worry, the Heavenly Court is still in His Majesty’s control. Hao Tian’s old friends are still in the minority. His Majesty has more than just the Divine Generals under him.”

His tone was full of confidence!

In that case, Han Jue had nothing to say.

“After the Flame Lord Emperor left, will a new guardian come?” Han Jue asked.

Without the Flame Lord Emperor around, he felt insecure, even though that guy was not as strong as him anyway.

Di Taibai said, “I’m here to talk about this. How’s your strength? If it’s not bad, you’ll have to rely on yourself during this period of time. I’ll cast a barrier around you. If an enemy comes, it’ll inform me immediately. I’ll come as quickly as possible to provide assistance. The Heavenly Court will be very busy during this period of time.”

As the leader of the Literature Immortals, Di Taibai had many things to do. He could even be said to be the busiest immortal of the Heavenly Court. Hearing this, Han Jue felt a little pity, but he could only accept it. “It’s fine. I can do it,” Han Jue replied.

As long as no Immortal Emperor came, he could withstand it.

Di Taibai nodded and quickly left.

Han Jue turned around and looked at the Scarlet Cloud World. It was surrounded by countless stars and looked so tiny.

“I hope the Buddhists won’t find trouble with me during this period of time.”

Han Jue thought silently.

The Heavenly River was located above the Nine Heavens. It surrounded the Heavenly Court’s Halls and pierced through the four Heavenly Gates.

Ji Xianshen sat by the river and cultivated. A hint of killing intent lingered between his brows.

His expression kept changing. Sometimes it was ecstasy, sometimes pain, sometimes anger, sometimes sorrow.

At this moment, a voice kept bewitching him.

“You have an invincible heart. You’re the only Immortal God in the world!”

“Why are you serving these fake Immortal Gods?”

“Why can’t you become a Heavenly Emperor yourself?”

“Why can’t you become the strongest in the Immortal World?”

Ji Xianshen suddenly opened his eyes and raised his arms. Terrifying Dharmic powers shook the Heavenly River in front of him, causing water to splatter everywhere.

He breathed heavily, his face ashen.

“Damn it! Did I encounter a mental demon? Is this Mystical Power a trap?”

Ji Xianshen gritted his teeth as he thought. This was the first time in his life that he had encountered a mental demon, so he was a little flustered.

He didn’t know who to ask for help in the huge Heavenly Court. If the words of his mental demon spread, how could the Heavenly Emperor tolerate him?

For some reason, Ji Xianshen suddenly thought of Han Jue.

No!

I have to descend into the mortal world! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After the Flame Lord Emperor disappeared, Han Jue didn’t dare to focus too much during his cultivation. To prevent any accidents, he created a Heavenly Puppet and sent it to guard the void.

Two years later.

Xun Chang’an came to visit him, wanting to learn a Mystical Power.

Han Jue didn’t refuse. He went out to teach the Mystical Power. The others wanted to learn it too, so they watched from the side.

Xun Chang’an’s cultivation level increased very quickly. He was about to break through to the Mahayana Realm. Before breaking through the love tribulation, he had already relied on the relic to break through to the Tribulation Transcendence Realm.

After Han Jue finished teaching him the Mystical Power, Fang Liang suddenly said, “Grandmaster, I want to ascend. Can I?”

Han Jue looked at him deeply and said, “If you want to, then go.”

The others didn’t follow suit. They felt that it was good to cultivate on the immortal mountain.

“So fast? Be careful not to get beaten up.” Murong Qi frowned.

He had the best relationship with him. They were like brothers, so he naturally didn’t want to see Fang Liang in trouble.

Fang Liang said, “I thought for a long time before deciding to head to the Upper World.”

Murong Qi asked, “Then, do you want me to accompany you?”

“You can’t!” Han Jue suddenly interrupted.

The two of them couldn’t help but look at him with puzzled expressions.

Han Jue said, “You can’t leave the mortal world unless you surpass me.” Surpass Grandmaster? Murong Qi was shocked, and the others had strange expressions.

Although they were amazed by each other’s talent, it was not worth mentioning compared to Han Jue.

Han Jue was the most talented among them!

“Grandmaster, why?” Murong Qi asked.

Han Jue waved his hand and said, “For your own good.”

With that, he stood up and left.

It wasn’t to return to the cave abode, but to the void outside the Scarlet Cloud World.

Murong Qi fell into deep thought. He didn’t dislike Han Jue’s overbearingness. He felt that he must have his reasons for saying that.

Recently, he had been seeing some images during his cultivation.

Could it be related to his previous life?

Everyone had their own past lives. Qian’er had one, Xun Chang’an had one, and so did he.

Grandmaster must know something!

In the Void.

Ji Xianshen carefully advanced.

This was the first time he had left the Immortal World. The void was vast and boundless, making it difficult for him to determine his direction.

Han Jue suddenly appeared in front of him, scaring him so much that he stepped back. He heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that it was him.

“Why are you here?” Ji Xianshen asked nervously.

Han Jue raised his hand expressionlessly.

Six Paths Soul Absorption Technique!

The terrifying wind pressure sucked at Ji Xianshen, but an invisible force pressed down on him, preventing him from flying towards Han Jue. The feeling of being squeezed was extremely uncomfortable.

Ji Xianshen was about to curse when a black shadow was sucked out of his body and quickly landed in Han Jue’s hand.

Han Jue stopped and frowned.

Ji Xianshen was shocked.

Could this be his mental demon?

A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue.

[Marshal Shen Peng has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 2 stars]
