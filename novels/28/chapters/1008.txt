Chapter 1011 Transcendent Rule, Freedom

“Sect Master, not bad…”

Li Daokong began to talk about his experiences over the years and subconsciously revealed a proud expression.

After a long time, Han Jue sighed. “Not bad. As expected of the person I like the most.”

Li Daokong was so excited that his face turned red. He knelt down again and cupped his fists. “Thank you for thinking highly of me, Sect Master.”

Han Jue asked, “Do you want me to preach the Dao?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Li Daokong immediately nodded. He would disdain to listen if it was any other mighty figure. However, Han Jue was different. He was the strongest in the Chaos.

Without knowing the Dao Creator, Li Daokong felt that Han Jue was the peak of cultivation. Han Jue sat down, and Li Daokong meditated. This dream lasted for a hundred years.

Han Jue opened his eyes and sighed when the dream ended.

A new era was really coming.

The generation that had once been protected by him had now become mighty figures who stirred up the chaos.

How wonderful.

Han Jue smiled and continued cultivating.

The Ultimate Origin Qi already occupied 80% to 90% of Ultimate Origin World. Before long, there would only be Ultimate Origin Qi in the Ultimate Origin World and no more nebulous Primordial Qi.

The Fiendcelestial Qi also nurtured Chaotic Fiendcelestials. There were a total of 2,947 of them. The remaining were in the second Dao Field.

Han Jue decided to enter seclusion for five million years.

A million years later, the Ultimate Origin World was filled with Ultimate Origin Qi and there was no more nebulous Primordial Qi.

Every million years, new opportunities would appear in the Ultimate Origin World, causing Han Jue’s cultivation level to constantly increase.

In the blink of an eye.

The five million years of seclusion came to a close.

Han Jue opened his eyes. A glint flashed across his red eyes.

He felt the Ultimate Origin World’s heaviness even though it was still in the depths of his soul.

Apart from the three thousand Great Dao that formed the order, Han Jue discovered that the Ultimate Origin World itself also nurtured an exclusive Transcendent Rule. This rule concerned the entire Ultimate Origin World. Even he couldn’t forcefully control it. The Ultimate Origin World would shatter if he interfered with this rule without permission.

This was only for him, the Creator. If it was an enemy, they would not be able to sense the existence of this Transcendent Rule.

Han Jue inexplicably thought of the Transcendent Rule of the Chaos. It was the rule that restricted talent and creation, preventing his bloodline from being passed down 100%.

The two were similar.

Han Jue still couldn’t figure out why this Transcendent Rule was so powerful.

“Father, you’re awake. Come and spar? I’ve already attained the Great Dao Supreme. I’m really strong now!” Han Ling said excitedly, causing Han Jue to raise his eyebrows.

Previously, when this girl had attained the Great Dao Sage Realm, she had comprehended a million Emperor Soldiers. Now, wouldn’t

she have ten million?

Han Jue was interested. “Come, try it.” Han Ling smiled and said, “You have to be careful. Even my second brother from the Chaotic Assembly was easily defeated by me in the simulation trial.”

Han Jue smiled.

The father and daughter entered the simulation trial.

As expected, Han Ling directly summoned ten million Emperor Soldiers. They all had her Dharmic powers and were equivalent to ten million Great Dao Supremes.

Han Jue directly used the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion to suppress her.

The entire process took less than a breath of time.

Han Ling opened her eyes and wailed, looking like a cute daughter.

Han Jue smiled and said, “You still have to

cultivate.”

“Hmph, Father is really competitive. You

never give in to me.”

“This is the goal of your cultivation. If I really can’t suppress you one day, I’m afraid you won’t be by my side anymore.”

Han Jue smiled and denied it.

He then asked, “Ling’er, do you want to go out for a walk after cultivating for ten million

years?”

Han Ling shook her head. “I’ve been there before. I know that I’m not fated with the

Chaos.”

Han Jue didn’t insist.

“By the way, your fifth brother has already developed ten generations of offspring in the

Immortal World. Do you want to take a look?”

Han Jue asked.

Han Ling looked at him and said, “Father, are

you going?”

“I still have to continue cultivating. I wonder how many years it will take for me to come

out of seclusion.”

“Then, I’ll accompany Father.”

“You little girl… Alright. I’ll personally bring you to travel the myriad worlds and meet the descendants of our Han family after I break

through.’

“

Han Jue chuckled, very satisfied with Han

Ling’s attitude.

Among his children, only Han Ling had the same personality as him and had always been cultivating diligently.

Han Jue stood up and went to visit the women. After all, they were his Dao Companions. He couldn’t ignore them.

Several decades later.

Han Jue left the second Dao Field and came to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.

He entered Fairy Xi Xuan’s Daoist temple.

Under the management of Han Zuitian and Li Xuan’ao, the disciples of the Hundred Peak Immortal River changed batch after batch. Fairy Xi Xuan and Chang Yue’er had already become extremely senior mighty figures here.

Usually, no disciple dared to disturb them because Li Xuan’ao and Han Zuitian felt that they had a close relationship with Han Jue and strictly forbade disciples from being rude.

“Fellow Daoist, I can come in for a chat.” In the Daoist temple.

Fairy Xi Xuan was disturbed from her cultivation. At first, she didn’t care and

thought that it was an illusion. After Han Jue repeated it, she suddenly opened her beautiful

eyes and hurriedly said, “Come in.” The door opened and Han Jue stepped in. The door closed.

Fairy Xi Xuan was a little stunned upon looking at the handsome Han Jue.

Han Jue also sighed when he saw her. They had once been master and disciple. That youth had already become extremely distant. Fairy Xi Xuan regained her composure. She was as cold and perfect as the first time Han

Jue saw her. “Please sit.”

Fairy Xi Xuan waved her hand, and a mat appeared in front of her.

Han Jue sat down and asked with a smile, “Long time no see. How have you been?” Fairy Xi Xuan replied, “It’s naturally good to be in the Dao Field. I don’t have any worries now. Instead, I feel that longevity is a little boring.”

“What? Fellow Daoist Xi Xuan wants to descend into the mortal world and experience

the suffering of the world?”

“You’re joking.”

Fairy Xi Xuan shook her head and laughed. She stared at him and asked, “Why haven’t you returned for ten million years? I thought you had already forgotten about the Hundred Peak Immortal River.”

Han Jue said, “To you, ten million years is a long time, but I’ve only entered seclusion twice. It’s like two dreams.”

Fairy Xi Xuan sighed in her heart. She sighed not because of Han Jue’s perception of time, but because his cultivation attitude had never changed, just like when the two of them first met.

They continued to chat. It was calm, but not awkward. Anyway, Han Jue felt very

comfortable.

Fairy Xi Xuan was like an old friend of his. Her attitude didn’t change because of his cultivation.

Only Fairy Xi Xuan was like this among his friends. She seemed to be like this forever,

having no desires.

After chatting for several hours, Han Jue prepared to leave. His heart skipped a beat

looking at Fairy Xi Xuan’s beautiful face. He

smiled and said, “Do you have any wishes or

needs? I’ll satisfy you. Now, I can help you

obtain whatever

you want. After this farewell,

I’ll definitely continue my seclusion. It might

be ten million years the next time I come.”

Fairy Xi Xuan was stunned.

Han Jue wasn’t in a hurry and waited for her

to make a request.

He noticed that Chang Yue’er was not in the Daoist temple next door. From the remnant aura, she had left for tens of thousands of years.

He secretly deduced and discovered that Chang Yue’er had already become Han Yunjin’s master. She even protected the Han family and usually pretended to be a cultivator to travel the Immortal World freely.
