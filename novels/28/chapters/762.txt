Chapter 765 I Want Revenge

“Why is Divine Lord Peacock chasing after you?”

He was also surprised. It had been hundreds of thousands of years. What kind of blood feud was this?

The Curse Fiendcelestial said gloomily, “I’m not sure, either. It should be related to Han Jue. Divine Lord Peacock has been chasing after me ever since he left the Heavenly Dao. We didn’t know each other at all before this.”

The Divine Robe Daoist’s eyes flickered. “You mean that Divine Lord Peacock is under Han Jue’s instructions?”.

The Curse Fiendcelestial nodded and gritted his teeth. “There’s a high chance that Han Jue seems to be proficient in subduing people. I’ve asked around. The Heavenly Dao’s Qiu Xilai and Heavenly Venerate Wufa were once enemies with Han Jue. Now, they are Han Jue’s strongest supporters. It’s the same for the Calamity Race’s Heavenly Calamity Emperor. It’s strange that Divine Lord Peacock can escape unscathed from the Heavenly Dao. There’s only one possibility, and that is that he has submitted to Han Jue!

“That’s right! That must be it!”

With the Divine Robe Daoist’s reminder, the Curse Fiendcelestial connected to other information and quickly figured it out.

Hatred appeared on his face.

Damn Han Jue, he stole my Great Dao and kept chasing after me!

Although he hated Han Jue, he had never targeted him. Why did Han Jue keep chasing after him?

This was too much!

No!

He was bullying the Great Dao too much!

The Curse Fiendcelestial looked up at the Divine Robe Daoist and said, “Exalted God, I’m not asking you to kill Han Jue. Kill Divine Lord Peacock first!”

However, the Divine Robe Daoist did not answer him. Instead, he stared at him.

The atmosphere became strange.

The Curse Fiendcelestial seemed to have thought of something. The poisonous worm on his face stopped and his body trembled slightly.

He said, “Forget it since you’re troubled. I won’t disturb your cultivation…”

He turned around and wanted to leave. Just as he moved, a powerful force suddenly froze him. He couldn’t move.

“Don’t leave since you’re already here.”

The Divine Robe Daoist’s voice entered the Curse Fiendcelestial’s ears.

The Curse Fiendcelestial’s eyes widened in despair.

I see!

No wonder the Divine Robe Daoist could return alive!

This move…

The Curse Fiendcelestial suddenly felt fear towards Han Jue.

Han Jue was not as cautious as he looked. He wasn’t only guarding an area. Now, it seemed that Han Jue had been plotting ahead. Protecting the Heavenly Dao was only the surface, making people think that he was just afraid of being disturbed.

Oh no!

He was screwed!

Buzhou Divine Mountain.

Han Yu sat under the old tree. A cool breeze blew past and fused with the world, turning into a beautiful painting.

At this moment…

Han Yu suddenly opened his eyes. He raised his eyebrows and muttered, “What is this feeling…”

He stood up and walked down the mountain.

At the foot of the mountain, a woman in green lay on the ground. Her abdomen was stained red with blood and her face was pale. She was on the verge of death.

Han Yu appeared in front of her with a frown.

Fighting was forbidden on Buzhou Divine Mountain. In other words, this woman had fled here with injuries.

Han Yu hesitated for a moment before healing her injuries.

With his cultivation level, treating an Immortal Realm cultivator was as easy as flipping his palm.

Soon, the woman in green woke up.

Han Yu had already disappeared. The woman in green was pleasantly surprised to find that her injuries had healed.

She touched her abdomen and muttered, “So there really is a Human Ancestor in seclusion here.”

She stood up and turned to look at the peak that she could not see. Her eyes became firm as she resolutely went up the mountain.

Several months later, the woman in green stopped halfway up the mountain. Looking up, rolling thunderclouds surrounded the mountain, forming an insurmountable cloud wall.

The green-robed woman knelt down and said loudly, “I want to acknowledge the Human Ancestor as my master and cultivate the Great Dao. I only want revenge. After my revenge is successful, I’m willing to come to Buzhou Divine Mountain to serve you forever.”

Her voice was very pleasant, but Han Yu was unmoved.

The woman in green shouted for several days but did not receive a reply. She found a place to meditate and cultivate, waiting for the senior to answer.

She waited for three thousand years.

Under the old tree, Han Yu opened his eyes with interest.

He asked, “Three thousand years have passed, do you still want revenge?”

The woman in green in meditation suddenly opened her eyes in surprise.

She hurriedly stood up and knelt down. She cupped her fists and said, “Yes, Senior!”

“What hatred is it? It’s been three thousand years and you still can’t let it go?”

The woman in green was only at the Immortal Realm. Three thousand years wasn’t a short period of time for her.

Hearing this, the woman in green replied, “The hatred of killing my master. My master adopted me and raised me like his own daughter. I won’t be able to live in peace if I don’t avenge him.”

Han Yu pinched his fingers to deduce and his expression turned strange.

Not hearing anything, the woman in green hurriedly said, “Senior, are you still there? I don’t need you to help me take revenge. You can just teach me a Mystical Power. I will serve you forever after I take revenge!”

Han Yu said faintly, “Your master is an Immortal Emperor, so your enemy is an Immortal Emperor. Do you know what an Immortal Emperor means?”

The woman in green was silent for a while before gritting her teeth. “I know it’s difficult, but I have to do it.”

“Then, do you know who’s behind that Immortal Emperor?”

“I don’t know…”

The green-robed woman’s face was pale. Although she didn’t know who the enemy’s backing was, she knew that in the Immortal World, all cultivators had their own relationships. The higher their cultivation level, the greater their background.

Han Yu said casually, “That’s a Deity Realm cultivator.”

The woman in green trembled and lowered her head.

Deity Realm… Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The woman in green did not dare to imagine. She had only heard of existences above the Immortal Emperor Realm, but she had never seen them.

She had once witnessed an Immortal Emperor attack. It could be said to be able to pluck the stars and move the moon. It was overwhelming and peerlessly powerful. Even an Immortal Emperor was like this, let alone a Deity Realm cultivator.

“Do you know who’s behind that Deity Realm cultivator?”

The woman lowered her head even more.

Han Yu continued, “When will revenge end? There’s always someone stronger. Hatred is endless. Why go that far?”

The woman in green gritted her teeth and said, “I’m not willing to give up. I want revenge even if I have to die for it!”

Han Yu stopped talking.

The woman in green continued kneeling.

She knelt for five hundred years.

As she knelt, she absorbed Qi and cultivated. She was still recalling the senior’s words.

Should she take revenge?

On this day, Han Yu’s voice floated down again, “Have you thought it through?”

The woman in green was stunned for a moment before she subconsciously said, “I want… revenge!”

Her expression became firm when she said the last word.

With that said, the rolling thunderclouds above her suddenly dispersed. Strands of sunlight scattered down and shone on the woman in green, making her feel as if a lifetime had passed.

She looked up and saw a figure standing at the edge of the cliff, looking down at her.

She was stunned as her gaze focused on him.

She thought that this senior had white hair, but she didn’t expect him to be such a handsome man. Never having seen such a handsome man before, she was momentarily stunned.

Han Yu smiled and said, “Come on up. Since you insist, I’ll teach you a Mystical Power. However, I won’t take you in as my disciple. It’s just to add a hint of interest to the boring years.”
