Chapter 303 Merit Supreme Treasure, Celebration of the Dark Forbidden Lord

The battle did not end even after Jiang Yi was repelled. Instead, it became even more spectacular.

The experts from various factions attacked, including Ji Xianshen. They surrounded the burly Magus.

The burly Magus raised the Ancestral Magus Tower with his left hand and fought with his right. He would fight as many as came.

However, he seemed to be holding back. Even if it was a Grand Unity Mystic Immortal, he did not kill the other party.

Han Jue took the opportunity to transform into the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor and attacked the burly Magus.

Under the concealment of the system, his cultivation aura had always been that of a Grand Unity True Immortal. The burly Magus did not think much of him.

Facing Han Jue, the burly Magus waved his fist.

However!

Han Jue suddenly disappeared and appeared beside the burly Magus. He slashed with his sword.

Unparalleled Sword Qi! The sword Qi directly sent the burly Magus flying and vomiting blood. Han Jue waved his sleeve and took away the Ancestral Magus Tower. Then, he used his movement technique and jumped out of the netherworld. The burly Magus steadied himself, his eyes wide with anger.

Han Jue had already held back. Otherwise, he would have killed him instantly.

The burly Magus roared angrily.

Ji Xianshen was stunned. He muttered, “The Ancestral Magus Tower was taken?”

Wait!

Wasn’t that person the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor?

Wasn’t that fellow dead?

Ji Xianshen had personally witnessed him being insta-killed by Han Jue. Why would he appear again? Could they be brothers?

Han Jue moved repeatedly in the void. After doing it dozens of times, he directly jumped into the netherworld and entered Hidden Sect Island.

The process sounded complicated, but in fact, it only took a few breaths of time.

After returning to Hidden Sect Island, with the Dao Field isolating them, the mighty figures of the Magus Race should not be able to deduce the Ancestral Magus Tower.

The Dao Field could block the divine sense of the Zenith Heaven Realm. The Magus Race was already desolate, so how could they still have Zenith Heaven Realm existences?

Han Jue came in front of Tu Ling’er and took out the Ancestral Magus Tower.

In an instant, the Ancestral Magus Tower shone on Tu Ling’er. Her twitching form suddenly stopped and flew up, then was sucked into the Ancestral Magus Tower.

Everyone was surprised. The Black Hell Demon Lord came over and said in surprise, “Could this be the legendary Ancestral Magus Tower?” Han Jue glanced at him and asked, “You know its origins?”

“Yes. Before the end of that Immeasurable Calamity, all the Ancestral Magi perished. The Ancestral Magus, Empress Houtu, who had already transformed into Reincarnation, kept all her clansmen in the Ancestral Magus Tower. She originally wanted to protect her clansmen, but the Heavenly Dao refused to allow it. It used the boundless power of virtuous merit to suppress the Ancestral Magus Tower. At that time, the Magus Race was filled with negative karma and was directly purified by the Heavenly Dao’s merit. All of them died, and the Ancestral Magus Tower also became a Merit Supreme Treasure.”

The Black Hell Demon Lord sighed. This legend was extremely ancient to him. It was so ancient that he wasn’t sure if it was true.

Han Jue asked curiously, “Shouldn’t this tower be the tomb of the Magus Race? How can it become their Supreme Treasure?”

The Black Hell Demon Lord replied, “Although the Magus Race perished in the Ancestral Magus Tower, they can rely on the tower to deepen their bloodline and even return to their ancestral roots. The Magus Race that survived today is all a combination of the Magus Race and humans from the Ancient Era. Their bloodline is not pure.”

I see.

Han Jue was even more puzzled.

Why would the Magus Race let such a treasure

out?

Did something happen?

Han Jue immediately checked his emails.

As expected, he discovered an email.

(Your good friend Meng Po was attacked by the Demon Race’s Immortal Emperor and was severely injured. Fortunately, the mighty figure of the netherworld saved her.]

Meng Po was severely injured again!

This time, she was attacked by an Immortal Emperor. It seemed that the Demon Court had targeted the Magus Race.

Han Jue thought silently.

The others surrounded the Ancestral Magus Tower and pointed.

After a while. Tu Ling’er’s voice came from inside the tower. “Master, I’m fine. This treasure acknowledged me as its master. I… I’ve let you down… You can take it back when I’m out.”

Han Jue smiled. “It’s fine. This treasure belongs to your Magus Race. It’s yours.”

He didn’t want to take this treasure. He didn’t want to be stained with great karma.

“None of you are allowed to speak of this matter, understand?” Han Jue reminded. Zhou Mingyue threw up his hands and said, “We’re not going out, anyway. There’s no chance to publicize it.”

Pa!

Chu Shiren slapped him on the head and almost knocked him to the ground. “How can you speak to Grandmaster like that!” Chu Shiren glared.

Zhou Mingyue hurriedly apologized to Han Jue and looked at Chu Shiren hatefully.

This shitty master had attacked too quickly. He had clearly been waiting for such an opportunity!

Han Jue shook his head and laughed. Then, he turned around and returned to the Connate Cave Abode.

This was just a small incident, and Han Jue didn’t take it to heart.

He continued to improve his Sword Dao. In the next half a year, he repeatedly headed to the Sword Dao River and raised all his Sword Dao Mystical Powers to the Deity Realm, reaching the limit.

Han Jue started the simulation trial. He instantly killed the Golden Crow Divine Emperor!

He fought the Heavenly Emperor and lasted for three breaths of time.

Victorious Fighting Buddha, insta-kill!

Black Hell Demon Lord, insta-kill!

The other enemies were all insta-killed!

Han Jue suddenly felt bored.

It was very difficult to encounter a satisfying battle. He suddenly missed the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor.

“I’m just saying it for fun. Please don’t let such an enemy appear again. Otherwise, I’ll have to run away again.”

Han Jue thought silently. He took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the Heavenly Dao Buddha.

His lifespan had reached three hundred trillion years. He could afford to spend some.

To maintain the round number, he could still spend five trillion years.

Of course, five trillion years was too much. Han Jue couldn’t bear to spend it.

He decided to use just ten billion years.

It was nothing.

It was rare for him to break through, and he had also helped his disciple snatch a Supreme Treasure. So what if he used ten billion years of his lifespan to celebrate?

The more Han Jue thought about it, the more he felt that it was reasonable.

He was only three thousand years old. He was still considered a youngster in the Immortal World.

A youngster had to be high-spirited and arrogant.

Five days later, Han Jue began to consume his lifespan while adding in his Dharmic powers.

As he cursed, he opened his attributes panel and watched as his lifespan decreased so that he wouldn’t become addicted.

In the Imperial Garden of the Heavenly Court.

The Heavenly Emperor and the Heavenly Dao Buddha were discussing when the Heavenly Dao Buddha’s expression changed drastically.

Damn it!

The Dark Forbidden Lord was cursing him?again!

Heavenly Dao Buddha hurriedly circulated his energy to suppress the curse. The Heavenly Emperor asked in surprise, “Buddha, what’s wrong?”

Heavenly Dao Buddha forced a smile and said, “It’s nothing. My Buddhist disciples are in trouble. I’ll deduce it. Wait for me.”

The Heavenly Emperor nodded and continued drinking.

As time passed, the Heavenly Dao Buddha’s expression turned uglier.

Crap!

The Dark Forbidden Lord was putting in more effort!

Heavenly Dao Buddha cursed silently. He had really been infuriated by the Dark Forbidden Lord.

He had previously mocked the Demon Emperor for his unstable Dao heart. Now, he finally understood why the Demon Emperor was so crazy.

The curse power of the Dark Forbidden Lord was actually very strong. Previously, it was just a teaser.

What happened?

Why was the Dark Forbidden Lord cursing him like this? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Heavenly Dao Buddha was puzzled.

He looked up at the Heavenly Emperor and asked, “By the way, Your Majesty, have you never been cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord?”

The Heavenly Emperor put down his wine cup and smiled bitterly. “How can that be? I don’t even dare to cultivate now.”

Oh.

Was he cursed again?

No wonder his expression was so ugly.

The Heavenly Emperor thought to himself.

He had actually never been cursed, but if he said it, it would appear that the Dark Forbidden Lord came from the Heavenly Court, and they would easily become everyone’s target.
