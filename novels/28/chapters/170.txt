Chapter 171 Supreme Buddha, Impossible to Cultivate

Ji Xianshen was angry for a while before beginning to talk about serious matters.

“I came to find you because I wanted to ask if you wanted to travel the Demon Realm together? The reason why the Black Fox Demon Emperor was able to rise is that he obtained the help of the Demon Realm. It’s also a mortal world, but one ruled by demons. If the two of us join forces, we will definitely be able to massacre the Demon Realm. At that time, all the resources will belong to you and me. This is also the request of the Immortal God who came to me in my dreams. The Heavenly Court and the demons are irreconcilable,” Ji Xianshen said in a low voice.

After knowing about Yang San and Daoist Jueyan, Ji Xianshen began to doubt the Heavenly Court.

Han Jue shook his head and said, “Go ahead. I’m too strong. If I make a move, you won’t have anything to do.”

Ji Xianshen: “…”

He felt insulted.

However, when he thought of the previous battle, he had to admit it. The difference in strength between the two was indeed huge.

Han Jue reminded, “Be careful. There are also demon factions in the Upper World. If you can obtain the instructions of the Heavenly Court’s immortals, the Demon Realm might have arrangements from the demons in the Upper World. As a pawn, you can’t be careless.”

The word “pawn” pierced Ji Xianshen’s heart.

However, after calming down, he also began to suspect something. In his dream, he had asked that Immortal God for help, asking the Heavenly Court not to do anything to their mortal world. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

However, the Immortal God said that the Heavenly Emperor had already made his decision. He couldn’t interfere.

From the looks of it, had he been played?

The more Ji Xianshen thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible.

“Other than this, is there anything else?” Han Jue asked. Ji Xianshen said, “Our Manor Lord has invited you to be the Deputy Manor Lord. Are you willing?”

Han Jue shook his head.

Ji Xianshen was disappointed.

Five minutes later.

Ji Xianshen left and Han Jue returned to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.

The Jade Pure Sacred Sect was still in an uproar. The battle just now was too exciting, and they were finding it difficult to calm down.

Han Jue ignored Yang Tiandong and the others and returned to the Connate Cave Abode.

He began to think.

At the mid-stage of the Reincarnation Earth Immortal Realm, he actually didn’t insta-kill the late-stage Grand Unity Earth Immortal Yang San!

This was a huge problem!

Apart from Sword Dao, he felt that he had to increase the strength of his Dharmic powers.

Han Jue pondered as he cultivated.

Seven years passed quickly.

A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue, who was cultivating.

(Giant Spiritual Martial God has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]

Han Jue was stunned.

Wasn’t it a favorable impression earlier?

Why did it suddenly become hatred?

Han Jue immediately checked the Martial God’s information.

(Giant Spiritual Martial God: Perfected Grand Unity Heaven Immortal Realm, fourth-grade Heavenly General. Because you killed his subordinate, Yang San, he has developed hatred towards you and thinks that you are too arrogant. When the Heavenly Court cleans up the mortal world, he will definitely teach you a lesson. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]

I see.

Perfected Grand Unity Heaven Immortal Realm. That was quite impressive!

Han Jue felt the pressure.

For this, he immediately took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the Giant Spiritual Martial God.

Time passed.

In the blink of an eye, twenty years passed.

Han Jue was already very close to the late stage of the Reincarnation Earth Immortal Realm.

On this day, a line of words appeared in front of him.

[Detected bearer of Connate providence, check its origin.)

Eh?

After so many years, he finally met another person with Connate providence!

Curious, Han Jue immediately chose to check.

[Chu Shiren: Eighth level of the Qi Refinement Realm. The reincarnation of the Supreme Buddha of the Immortal World. In order to experience the suffering of the mortal world, the Supreme Buddha reincarnated into the mortal world. Due to the Buddha’s immense providence, Chu Shiren is extremely talented, and his providence is not inferior to that of the Children of Heaven and Earth. As he grew up in a Daoist temple, he has a benevolent heart and hates evil. He does not pursue cultivation and hopes to use his mortal body to enlighten the people. Under the guidance of the Buddha in his dreams, he came to the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. His original intention is to promote the Great Kindness Dharmic Dao in the cultivation sect.]

Reincarnation of the Revered Supreme Buddha!

Han Jue was shocked.

He noticed that the reason why Chu Shiren came to the Jade Pure Sacred Sect was that he was guided by the Buddha in his dreams!

What was the meaning of this? The Buddhists of the Immortal World noticed

him?

Were they deliberately sending spies?

Or was the Buddhist Sect here for the reincarnated Xun Chang’an?

Han Jue was very cautious.

I can’t accept this kid!

He pretended not to see it!

Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating

Jade Pure Sacred Sect, Heavenly Thunder Peak.

In a hall, the coaching elder of Heavenly Thunder Peak was frowning at a man.

This man was none other than the reincarnated Supreme Buddha.

Chu Shiren wore a Daoist robe and looked young and handsome. He had an optimistic and cheerful smile on his face.

The coaching elder said helplessly, “You’ve been in the sect for five years and have yet to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. With your talent, you shouldn’t be like this. What do you usually do?”

In the current Jade Pure Sacred Sect, one only had the right to enter the inner sect after reaching the Golden Core Realm. His exception to recruit Chu Shiren had already caused the disciples of the Heavenly Thunder Peak to criticize him.

Back then, it was the coaching elder who led Chu Shiren into cultivation. In seven days, he cultivated from zero to the fourth level of the Qi Refinement Realm!

Such talent was simply unheard of!

It was precisely because of this that the coaching elder had made an exception to take Chu Shiren as his personal disciple!

He had originally wanted to give the sect a surprise, but he didn’t expect it to become his nightmare!

This disciple actually doesn’t like to cultivate!

Yes!

He didn’t like it!

Damn it!

If you don’t like it, why did you acknowledge me as your master?

The coaching elder had a headache. He had forgotten that he was the one who insisted on taking in Chu Shiren as his disciple.

Chu Shiren smiled and said, “Master, you know my ambitions. I think spirit energy is the greatest obstacle to the development of peace. Therefore, it’s impossible for me to cultivate.”

Impossible to cultivate!

The coaching elder almost died of anger.

“I should really send you to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain and let the Deity Slaying Elder change your personality!” The coaching elder snorted.

Chu Shiren had been to the Jade Pure Sacred Sect for a period of time and had naturally heard of the legend of the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain. He asked curiously, “Master, what kind of person is the Deity Slaying Elder?” He was very curious about this elder. As the strongest cultivator in the entire sect, the Deity Slaying Elder rarely showed himself. He didn’t touch power or cause trouble. He didn’t want women and only attacked when the sect was facing a calamity.

In his opinion, this was a saint!

He felt that understanding the Deity Slaying Elder would help him consolidate the Great Dao he wanted.

Equality of all life!

“How would I know? I’ve been in the sect for so long, but I’ve never seen him before.” The coaching elder snorted.

This was the truth. He had only entered the sect for a few hundred years. Chu Shiren asked, “Why does the world insist on pursuing longevity? Is longevity really good? With the inherent bad nature of people, if everyone lives forever, how can the world withstand it?”

Hearing his question, the coaching elder felt a headache. He said angrily, “Not everyone can live forever. Longevity is only a legend. People cultivate to fight against the heavens.”

“Has the heavens mistreated the world?”

“Get lost!”

“Master, let me give you a piece of advice. It’s best not to cultivate anymore. You and I can promote peace together…”

“If you don’t get lost, I’ll expel you from the

sect!”

“Alright!”

Chu Shiren sighed and left in disappointment.

The coaching elder was really envious of his talent. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have spoiled him like this.

However, there was something wrong with Chu Shiren’s mind.

Should I send him to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain for a period of time? This thought appeared in the coaching elder’s mind.
