Chapter 738 Control, Great Sage Void Soul

After hearing Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s words, Han Jue was a little surprised. The news spread so quickly?

First Life Black Sovereign was too daring!

In the battle of the Heavenly Court, he had lost a total of fifteen Lives. Other than the thirteen Lives killed by Han Jue, there was also the Life who used his Dark Instinct and the one who provoked the Heavenly Court at the beginning

After provoking the Heavenly Court, Han Jue secretly left it to the Evil Heavenly Emperor before leaving

Logically speaking, under normal circumstances, after suffering such a heavy loss, one should rest for a period of time. However, the First Life Black Sovereign was different. He was even more blatant and fearless.

Also…

The appearance of Life should be considered destroying the Chaos. Why did it not offend the Chaotic Consciousness?

Could it be that in the eyes of the Chaotic Consciousness, they were no threat at all?

It was very likely!

No matter what, the First Life Black Sovereign was still defeated by Pangu. The Dark Forbidden Lord was different. Ever since his reputation rose, he had never lost. Even the Chaotic Consciousness could not determine who he was.

Perhaps the Chaotic Consciousness already knew that Han Jue might be the Dark Forbidden Lord, but he was still uncertain.

After all, the Heavenly Dao had once stirred up an era for the Dark Forbidden Lord. Countless cultivators imitated him and had guesses about him.

Han Jue thought silently and understood.

Qiu Xilai said, “As long as they don’t threaten the Heavenly Dao, there’s no need to care about them. Although many Great Dao Sages have befriended the Heavenly Dao, the foundation of the Heavenly Dao is still too weak. The most important thing now is to develop the Heavenly Dao and not be taken over by the Great Dao Sages.”

Fang Liang said, “That’s right. Never trust those Great Dao Sages completely.”

Pan Xin said, “I was attacked by Di Jiang when I was returning. He wanted to snatch my Heaven-Opening Axe. How detestable.”

His expression was calm. He was not furious.

He had been surrounded by a group of Great Dao Sages in the past and had still fought his way out. How could the twelve Ancestral Magi stop him?

The other Sages were silent, not knowing what to say.

It was already a consensus to cooperate with the Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. The conflict between Pan Xin and Di Jiang was only about Pangu’s lineage and could not break the consensus.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “In that case, let’s not care about Life for the time being. The Chaotic Heavenly Road should connect to more Chaotic Worlds. This way, the providence of the Heavenly Dao will increase faster. In addition, you can create a mortal world outside the Heavenly Dao. The Immortal World will still be the center of the Heavenly Dao in the future. When the Heavenly Dao covers the Chaos, the Immortal World will be the center of the Chaos…”

He began to talk about the plan, making the Sages excited.

The current Heavenly Dao had already become powerful. All the Sages and even all living beings were tied to the situation. They were all rushing forward with all their might. No one could stop this situation.

An hour later, they began to discuss the new Sage position.

Han Jue didn’t participate. It didn’t affect him no matter who obtained it.

However, he noticed that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du seemed to want this spot.

Apart from Han Jue’s protection, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had contributed the most to the Heavenly Dao today. He had always been diligent and rarely raised his needs.

Han Jue had a good impression of him and said, “Give it to the Human School. Fellow Daoist Xuan Du has contributed so much. The Human School should also be promoted. In the future, every providence sect will have more than one Heavenly Dao Sage. The Heavenly Dao Sage Realm is no longer our highest demand. I see that your cultivation levels are increasing. It’s not wishful thinking to attain the Freedom Realm.”

The moment he spoke, the Sages did not dare to have any objections. At the same time, they began to look forward to his words.

They would have scoffed at others if they said this.

However, Han Jue was a Great Dao Sage!

In the eyes of the Great Dao Sages, what was a Freedom Sage?

For a time, the Sages began to support Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and even flatter him.

At this moment, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du would not reject. He immediately agreed and thanked Han Jue.

As a new Sage, Su Qi silently watched all of this. He only had one feeling. Master controlled everything!

After the Sage Meeting ended, Han Jue’s soul fragment dissipated.

He continued to cultivate.

Five thousand years passed quickly.

[Primordial Heavenly Prison has successfully enslaved the target.)

[Great Sage Void Soul (Life) has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.]

Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.

It took him 15,000 years!

He immediately checked the profile picture of Great Sage Void Soul.

(Great Sage Void Soul: Late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, Tribulation Calamity Life Controller, Chaotic Lifeform. After attaining the Great Dao, he was attacked by a Great Dao Divine Spirit and was suppressed at the edge of the Chaos. Later, he was saved by the First Life Black Sovereign and turned into Life. Current favorability: Max.]

Tsk tsk, another mighty figure with a tragic

past.

How many sins had the Great Dao Divine Spirits committed?

Great Sage Void Soul opened his eyes and knelt down.

Han Jue asked, “Tell me everything you know about Life.”

Great Sage Void Soul immediately told the truth.

Currently, the First Life Black Sovereign had already developed more than fifty Lives. Half of them were Great Dao Sages. These Great Dao Sages were all expelled by the Chaos or existences who hated the Chaos.

Below Life were the Dark Life Soldiers. There were countless of them. They were all races that had been suppressed by the Chaos.

Above Life and below the First Life Black Sovereign were seven Divine Lives. They were extremely mysterious and were said to be existences even older than the Heavenly Dao.

Great Sage Void Soul did not have a deep understanding of the Life faction. He didn’t even know where the First Life Black Sovereign was hiding.

“What’s the Life Lord hiding from?” Han Jue asked.

Life Lord was the First Life Black Sovereign.

Great Sage Void Soul frowned and said, “I’m not sure, either. I’ve only seen him once. He mentioned a name, Primordial Fiendcelestial.”

Han Jue narrowed his eyes. “Is there really a Primordial Fiendcelestial hidden in the Chaos?”

He knew that the Chaos could only accommodate one Primordial Fiendcelestial, and that was him.

Great Sage Void Soul shook his head., “I’m not sure, either. I’ve also investigated the Primordial Fiendcelestial. Legend has it that the reason why the three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials fought in chaos was not only to attain the Dao but also to transform into an existence that surpassed the Chaotic Fiendcelestial, which is the Primordial Fiendcelestial. However, after Pangu succeeded, he did not become a Primordial Fiendcelestial and instead died. Some say that Pangu saw how terrifying the Primordial Fiendcelestial was, so he hid in fear and did not really die.”

Han Jue fell into deep thought.

He asked again, “If I let you go now, do you think you can still infiltrate the Life faction?”

Great Sage Void Soul shook his head. “No, Life Lord has already sensed my betrayal.”

Han Jue could only give up. He let Great Sage Void Soul go out and find a place to cultivate. He would stay in the Hundred Peak Immortal River in the future and not tell anyone his true identity. He would say that he was a Dao Field guard.

Great Sage Void Soul was a Great Dao Sage, after all. He could protect the Heavenly Dao in the future.

As for the second Dao Field, Han Jue still had to maintain his original thoughts.

Only the Chaotic Fiendcelestials could stay in the second Dao Field! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Han Jue asked in his mind, “I want to know if there is another Primordial Fiendcelestial other than me, including the blank domain outside the Chaos.”

(The Chaos can only accommodate one Primordial Fiendcelestial. The blank domain outside the Chaos cannot be deduced for the time being. The blank domain means that it is absolutely blank. There are no living beings. Even if there are, they will lose consciousness, no different from being dead.)

This time, his lifespan was not deducted.
