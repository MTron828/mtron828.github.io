Chapter 759 Unable to Break Through

Han Jue comforted Shi Dudao. He was relieved seeing that he had no complaints.

Han Jue sighed after the dream ended. “Shi Dudao is not bad. I can focus on nurturing him in the future. He has patience and determination. His future is limitless.”

He would observe for hundreds of thousands of years first.

In any case, Shi Dudao and Li Daokong had both become Life. Nothing would happen for the time being.

Currently, Life was still fearless. It seemed that no force could restrain them. The Great Dao Divine Spirits did not move, either.

Han Jue came to the second Dao Field and released Dao Comprehension Sword.

Their appearance alerted Li Yao.

Li Yao opened her eyes and saw Dao Comprehension Sword. She immediately looked happy.

Dao Comprehension Sword slowly opened her eyes. Seeing Han Jue and Li Yao, she couldn’t help but be in a daze.

During the fusion process, Han Jue was busy cultivating and ignored her, causing her to be in a deep sleep. Because it was too painful, she could only numb herself with sleep.

She was stunned. Then, she felt that the boundless power coming from her body was far greater than before.

She was not dead? She had been reborn?

“Congratulations on becoming a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.” Li Yao walked in front of her and smiled as she held her hand.

They had known each other for hundreds of thousands of years and had established the Holy Mother Sect together. Their relationship was naturally good.

Dao Comprehension Sword asked in surprise, “Why did I become a Chaotic Fiendcelestial?”

Han Jue said, “Because I helped, of course. Didn’t you come to me to become stronger?”

Dao Comprehension Sword’s beautiful face instantly turned red.

Han Jue added, “Stay here from now on.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

With that, he returned to the main Dao Field.

Once he left, Dao Comprehension Sword heaved a sigh of relief and regained her nature. She looked at Li Yao and asked curiously, “How can Master transform people into Chaotic Fiendcelestials? Chaotic Fiendcelestials are the top potential in the legends of the Chaos.”

Li Yao introduced the situation of the second Dao Field. She was shocked to learn that other than her, others had also become Chaotic Fiendcelestials.

How many secrets was Master hiding?

She covered the second Dao Field with her divine sense and felt powerful auras that were not inferior to hers!

This power was much stronger than the Hidden Sect!

After releasing Dao Comprehension Sword, Han Jue entered cultivation again.

Cultivation was endless. In the eyes of Sages, time was nothing. Longevity was sometimes boring. Year after year passed.

Tens of thousands of years later.

[Detected that you are 700,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]

(1: Exit seclusion immediately and spread the name of the Primordial Fiendcelestial, stirring up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.]

[2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]

It was the same as the 600,000 years old option. Han Jue directly chose the second option.

(Congratulations on obtaining the Chaotic Supreme Treasure—Three Thousand Heavenly Dragon Ribbon)

[Three Thousand Heavenly Dragon Ribbon: Defensive Chaotic Supreme Treasure. It is formed by the providence of 3,000 Chaotic Heavenly Dragons. It contains extremely strong defense and can block Great Dao attacks. It can isolate the damage of karma and negative karma.)

Great!

Another defensive Supreme Treasure!

With four defensive Supreme Treasures, even a Great Dao Supreme could not insta-kill him!

Right!

Han Jue asked in his mind.

(500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[Yes, you can’t be insta-killed.)

The corners of Han Jue’s mouth curled up. Then, he took out the Three Thousand Heavenly Dragon Ribbon and started refining it.

The refinement was successful after eighty years.

The three thousand dragons automatically wrapped around Han Jue. They followed his waist and wrapped around his arms. The two ends landed behind him. Golden light burst out and dragon shadows appeared behind him. The dragons twisted and their divine might was vast.

Han Jue sized himself up. He had become more impressive again.

Han Jue immediately entered the simulation trial and challenged the Foolish Sword Sage.

He stood still and let the Foolish Sword Sage hit him.

The Foolish Sword Sage still couldn’t break through his defense even after an hour. Han Jue took out the Heaven-Opening Axe and insta-killed him.

Boring.

Han Jue opened his eyes and sighed.

None of them could fight!

Then, he fused the Creation Spirit Stone with the Scarlet Clear Fiendcelestial.

In a vast hall, the Evil Heavenly Emperor stood in front of a huge cauldron.

Han Tuo sat in the boiling medicine inside the cauldron. He was frowning and his expression was ugly.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s eyes were filled with worry.

At this moment, the Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial’s voice sounded, “Don’t worry. I’ve already removed the spatial power in his body.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor grumbled, “I’ve already said that we’re not Di Jiang’s match, let alone the other Ancestral Magi. Especially that Time Ancestral Magus, Zhu Jiuyin, who’s invincible in the Freedom Realm.”

The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial was silent.

After a long while…

He said faintly, “I didn’t expect Di Jiang to be so powerful. It seems that Pangu’s providence is protecting them.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor snorted. “Then, do you still want us to continue fighting the twelve Ancestral Magi? My Heavenly Court will be destroyed if we continue.”

The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial snorted. “What a disappointment. Forget it, I’ll personally deal with Di Jiang when the time comes.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor immediately smiled. “Thank you for your understanding, Senior.”

The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial did not appear. It was unknown what his expression was.

After a while, the Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial suddenly asked, “How has Han Jue been recently? Why isn’t there any movement from him?”

The current Heavenly Dao had already established itself in the Chaos. Its development was very ferocious and would surpass the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End sooner or later.

“He’s most likely cultivating in seclusion. I know him too well.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled.

The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial asked curiously, “Why is he cultivating so hard? He doesn’t seem to have any goals.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “Cultivation is the goal.”

The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial said in a low voice, “After some time, accompany me to the Heavenly Dao to visit him.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned. “What do you want? Don’t think about using any opportunities to attract his help. He’s most afraid of trouble.”

The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial said helplessly, “Why do you keep speaking up for him? I treat you well. Why don’t you think about me?”

“We’re like father and son. Why fuss about this?”

“Hehe.”

Silence returned to the hall.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s gaze landed on Han Tuo again.

In the darkness, a coffin moved quickly.

A figure sat on the coffin. It was Huang Zuntian.

Huang Zuntian looked ahead and asked softly, “Where are we going?” A voice came from his body, low and hoarse, “Ancient Desolate.”

“Why?”

“Help us activate the Primordial Chaos Tablet. It is a Supreme Treasure born at the beginning of the Chaos. It is not inferior to Pangu’s Heaven-Opening Axe. With it, you will truly rise.”

Huang Zuntian raised his eyebrows. He was naturally familiar with the Heaven-Opening Axe.

That was a Supreme Treasure that Pan Xin was most proud of. Back then, Pan Xin had relied on the Heaven-Opening Axe to break through the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. Even now, his achievements were still very terrifying

Huang Zuntian asked, “Isn’t the Ancient Desolate dangerous?”

Primordial Origin replied, “I’ve calculated. The Ancient Desolate is relatively safe during this period of time. Those terrifying existences have already left. After arriving there, look away when you see tombstones and mirages. Don’t provoke them.”
