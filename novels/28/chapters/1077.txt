Chapter 1080 Existence to Resist Divine Might

Xing Hongxuan waved her sleeve and cast a spell. A screen of light appeared in front of everyone and began to show her dream.

In the dream, a youth rode his sword forward. In front of him was a peerless demon trampling on a ruined city filled with smoke. The wails and screams of countless people resounded through the sky.

The youth wore white clothes. He raised his hand and pointed. It was actually the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger. Sword Qi followed the tip of his finger and shot out. From ten thousand miles away, it pierced through the head of the unparalleled demon, causing blood to splatter through the yellow sky.

Han Jue had a strange expression.

It had to be said that this youth indeed had his taste.

“Strange, nothing like this is happening in the Heavenly Dao.”

Chang Yue’er counted with her fingers. The situation in the Heavenly Dao did not match the scene in the dream.

There were many Jade Pure Sects in the

Heavenly Dao. Their names were common,

but

when combined with this battle and that youth,

they could not deduce it at all.

Fairy Xi Xuan stared at the dream and said,

“Perhaps it isn’t happening now.”

The women continued to watch.

The dream kept changing and intercepted the key processes of several battles. These experiences were too similar to Han Jue’s battles. Of course, they were not completely identical, but they would always think of him. Li Yao asked after Xing Hongxuan’s dream showing ended, “Could it be a descendant?” Qingluan’er nodded. “Probably. Many of my descendants admire you, husband.”

That was a good idea.

Han Jue smiled. “You’ll know in the future. Anyway, I can’t deduce it for the time being. It can only be something in the future. If you can dream of it, it might come from Huang’er’s lineage.”

Xing Hongxuan’s eyes lit up. “Huang’er will marry and have children?”

Han Huang had a heart of stone. All these years, there had been no woman around him. He seemed to look down on women.

Only Han Jue knew that Han Huang felt that he was not from the same race as all living beings, so he didn’t marry.

It was just like how it was very difficult for a person to marry chickens and dogs. Even if they were all the same after transforming, the pride in Han Huang’s bones did not allow him to do that.

“Perhaps. Who can predict marriage?”

Han Jue smiled and stood up. Then, he left the Daoist temple, leaving the women to discuss curiously.

Women were all gossipy. They were all curious about what kind of woman Han Huang would

marry.

On the other side.

Transcendent Domain, Creation Emperor

Court.

In the dark hall, faint white flames burned at the edge. Thunderclouds appeared in the sky. Han Huang sat in a mysterious pool. Beside him stood the Primordial Divine Spear. Purple dragons wrapped around it and were nourished by the water.

Footsteps sounded and Han Ling, who was

wearing a graceful golden dress, walked over. She wore a phoenix crown and a mysterious jade stone hung on her forehead. It emitted a dazzling light and covered her peerless appearance. Behind her long dress floated a row of Emperor Soldier shadows. They were like guards and were inseparable from her.

Han Ling stopped and looked at Han Huang from afar. “Second Brother, don’t be so stubborn anymore. That existence is willing to let you comprehend the power of the Seven Supreme Rules.”

Han Huang did not even look up. “Thank him for his kind intentions. I have to comprehend my Mystical Power first. I’ve comprehended a lot from the previous battle. I’m not obsessed. Fourth Sister, don’t worry.’

Han Ling sighed softly. “That Ultimate Evil

Chaotic Devil is indeed powerful. Even if ten of me help you, I’m not his match. It’s mainly the difference in cultivation realm.”

“But how long has it been since the Ultimate

Evil Chaotic Devil’s birth?”

“His background shouldn’t be that simple. Even Father can only expel him.”

“No matter what his background is, he’s still

stronger than us. This is the truth. We have to work hard to surpass him!”

Han Huang spoke firmly. Han Ling could only

sigh again.

The hall was silent, only the sound of flowing water echoing in the pool.

Han Ling turned around and left, leaving behind a sentence: “Second Brother, your focus

should be on the Primordial Chaos and not others. If you are too obsessed with the strength of others, you will forget the most basic and important things. Becoming stronger is more important than thinking of all ways to defeat others.”

Han Huang opened his eyes and looked at her

back, frowning.

He did not refute but fell into deep thought.

Chaos, Nine Extremes Orthodoxy.

Zhao Shuangquan, the Nine-Headed Divine

Spirit, and Yu Yuan meditated facing each other. Yu Yuan saw Zhao Shuangquan’s ugly expression and asked, “Dao Lord, what do you want to say?”

Zhao Shuangquan glanced at him and took a deep breath before speaking. “The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy needs to become stronger. The current level is far from enough.” Zhao Shuangquan, who had already awakened the memories of the Eighth Chaos, knew Yu

Yuan’s true identity. He was the successor of

the First Chaos’ will and would be possessed by the First Chaos sooner or later. However, he had to hide this truth. For this, he nurtured Yu Yuan vigorously and let him receive treatment that far exceeded what he had received in the

Creation Emperor Court. “The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy lacks top mighty figures the most. I remember an

existence who was the previous leader of the Divine Spirits. His name is the Primordial Ancestor God, and he has strength that’s not

inferior to the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.” The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit smiled leisurely. Zhao Shuangquan raised his eyebrows. “Where

is he?” “He was cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord

and only has a wisp of his will left. He’s still in the blank domain. I’ll think of a way to revive him. He was once my right-hand man and will listen to me.”

“Oh? You were so powerful in the past?”

“Cough cough, I once controlled the Chaos.” “Then why are you in such a situation?” Zhao Shuangquan and Yu Yuan looked at the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit in confusion. The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit was embarrassed and did not answer.

Zhao Shuangquan narrowed his eyes and asked, “Who is it?”

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit said, “Divine

Might… However, this is in the past. I was careless back then.”

Zhao Shuangquan did not ask further. After

seeing the scene of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage suppressing the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil, he knew that the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit’s defeat was not in vain.

Yu Yuan did not interrupt. It was unknown what he was thinking. “One is not enough. What I want is strength

that can resist the Divine Might. The more existences like the Primordial Ancestor God, the better. When the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity comes, who can guarantee that the Divine Might will not enter the calamity?” Zhao Shuangquan said in a low voice. He was used to preparing for the worst.

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit looked bitter. Brat, do you really think there are many existences like the Primordial Ancestor God?

If not for the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s appearance, the Primordial Ancestor God would be considered an invincible existence in the

Chaos.

The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit sighed in his heart. Where did that Divine Might Heavenly Sage come from? He had risen too quickly, he could not understand his growth speed. “Where’s the Dark Forbidden Lord? Can’t he Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

even curse the Primordial Ancestor God to

death?” Yu Yuan asked. The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit rolled his eyes. “How mysterious is the Dark Forbidden Lord? Even Divine Might was cursed by him. You want to subdue him?”

Yu Yuan said, “The Dark Forbidden Lord

doesn’t dare to show himself. He must be

afraid. He might be more confident if we join forces with him.”

“That’s easy to say. How can we rope him in?” “The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy can directly believe in the Dark Forbidden Lord and wait for

him to take the initiative to contact us. We can also recruit the Dark Forbidden Lord’s believers. As for the negative effects, we can

fabricate his legend and beautify him. There aren’t many people who truly hate the Dark Forbidden Lord in this era.” Zhao Shuangquan’s eyes light up.
