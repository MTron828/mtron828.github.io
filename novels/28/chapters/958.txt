Chapter 960 Number One Person Since Ancient Times

Powerful auras appeared in all directions of the Grand Primordium Domain as soon as he finished speaking.

Han Jue also felt some familiar auras.

Twelve Ancestral Magi! Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning!

The Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End also came.

After millions of years, all twelve Ancestral Magi had attained the Great Dao.

These Great Dao Sages were originally on good terms with the Heavenly Dao, but now, they had become enemies.

Han Jue was expressionless. He wouldn’t show mercy.

It was not only the Great Dao Sages. The Great Dao Supremes also came!

Terrifying figures that seemed to come from the ends of the Ancient Desolate stepped over with world-destroying divine might. All the killing intent locked onto Han Jue and the dilapidated Grand Primordium Domain trembled.

Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols condensed above Han Jue’s head.

In an instant, five hundred Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols condensed successfully. Five hundred was enough!

The battle was about to begin!

The five hundred Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols faced each other and roared in all directions, each using a Mystical Power.

The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial punched out. The wind from his fist was ferocious and tore through the void!

The Shadow Flood Fiendcelestial raised its arms. Countless Shadow Fiendcelestials attacked like a torrent, unstoppable!

The Combat Fiendcelestial condensed a battle intent divine weapon. The power of the divine weapon shook the Chaotic Qi and suppressed the aura of all enemies!

…

Inside the Daoist temple.

Han Jue opened his eyes. Xing Hongxuan had just finished receiving a round of Absolute Purification.

It took more than a hundred years, and his lifespan was also deducted. Absolute Purification could only be used one-on-one.

It was really troublesome to use Absolute Purification to break through the Chaotic Will. He could at most use it on his family and personal disciples. Not to mention the Heavenly Dao, he couldn’t even save the Hidden Sect.

This path did not work.

Xing Hongxuan opened her eyes and saw him. She couldn’t help but ask curiously, “Husband, what happened? I think I had a dream that we became enemies…”

She was extremely afraid upon recalling the dream.

It was too real.

Fortunately, it was all fake!

Han Jue said, “That was not a dream.”

He pointed at her forehead.

The scenes of the Hundred Peak Immortal River surged into her mind, stunning her.

Han Jue explained all of this to her, making her completely shocked.

“Chaotic Will…” Xing Hongxuan muttered to herself, her voice trembling.

Although she had been cultivating beside Han Jue, she didn’t understand his vision. Her cultivation level made her unable to even understand the Chaos.

She didn’t even dare to think about manipulating everyone’s thoughts.

What kind of existence was the Chaotic Will that could control all living beings…

In that case, what was the point of living beings?

Xing Hongxuan was confused.

She suddenly felt that everything was meaningless.

She couldn’t be said to be weak. Everyone else was the same.

What was the point of life when one discovered that one could be controlled by an existence?

Han Jue said, “Don’t be afraid. I’m here.”

His words were very light, but they carried a lot of weight. Xing Hongxuan looked at him and saw that he was calm. Her heart warmed and her previous sense of security returned. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

That’s right.

With her husband around, what was she afraid of?

Xing Hongxuan suddenly thought of something. “Isn’t Huang’er…”

Han Jue said, “That’s right. Next, stay here and cultivate well. Don’t go anywhere. Although they are controlled by the Chaotic Will, they only hate me and don’t have to kill me relentlessly. They won’t find trouble with me before they are confident. I still have time to become stronger.”

Xing Hongxuan nodded and did not dare to ask for anything. All she could do now was not to be a burden.

now was

Han Jue only used Absolute Purification to test this function. It took too long. He decided to cultivate hard.

Since he might not be able to defeat the clone of the Chaotic Will, he might as well force it.

He used his clones to constantly kill the powerful enemies and weaken the Chaos, forcing the Dao Creator to interfere.

In any case, Han Jue’s main body was hiding in the Dao Field. The Dao Creator couldn’t hurt him!

Let’s just do it!

Han Jue’s eyes emitted a cold light.

Xing Hongxuan saw the killing intent, but she did not say anything.

In her heart, Han Jue was the most important. Even if all living beings were controlled to kill Han Jue and were killed by him, she would never pity them.

She was very petty. There were not many people she could be concerned about. Her husband and son were enough.

Grand Primordium Domain.

Blood Qi surrounded the world. Corpses of different sizes were scattered in all directions of the Grand Primordium Domain.

At first glance, this place was like a chaotic land. The ferocious negative karma was visible to the naked eye.

Han Jue’s clone was sitting in the Grand Primordium Domain and waiting quietly.

After a hundred years, all the mighty figures who came to challenge were killed by him!

However, most mighty figures had life-saving methods. They either left behind clones, soul fragments, or Supreme Treasures to escape.

Han Jue didn’t kill them all, but some pitiful worms came to die without any life-saving methods. He didn’t pity them. Now, the entire Chaos knew where he was. His terrifying battle achievements had also spread throughout the Chaos. The name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage had become even more terrifying than the Dark Forbidden Lord.

On this day.

Another mighty figure had arrived!

Han Jue opened his eyes and saw a sword Qi crossing the void outside the Grand Primordium Domain, as if it was splitting the Chaos into two.

Above the sword Qi was a figure dressed in a Daoist robe. He had white hair and sleeves that fluttered in the wind. His aura was like a sword that pierced through the Chaotic Void.

Laozi!

The two of them looked at each other from afar. The blood Qi and Chaotic Qi around the Grand Primordium Domain instantly stopped as if space and time had stopped.

At this moment, countless cultivators stopped and watched from afar. They didn’t dare to approach, afraid that they would be affected.

“Laozi is here!”

“I hope he can resist the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.”

“Sigh, it’s tough. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is too strong. I feel that he’s already invincible.”

“He defeated the Divine Authority Generals, killed the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, and defeated a hundred Great Dao Sages. Since ancient times, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is indeed number one. However, this person has done many evil things. He’s the calamity of the Chaos.”

“What will happen to the Chaos if even Laozi is defeated?”

“Laozi has a chance of winning as long as he can restrain the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. He’s not fighting alone, after all!”

Han Jue stood up and stepped out of the Grand Primordium Domain.

Laozi looked at him and said, “Actually, you have other paths to take. The path you chose is a path of no return. That Giant God was like this in the past. He died and his Dao dissipated. You can learn from my master.”

Pangu slaughtered three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials and finally died.

The Dao Ancestor didn’t cause too much trouble. He had probably chosen another path and compromised. From then on, the Heavenly Dao stopped moving. An Immeasurable Calamity appeared every time his strength was about to improve.

He couldn’t ask Han Jue to imitate the Dao Ancestor.

Times were different from the past. If he lowered his head, the Heavenly Dao would not be as simple as stagnant. How many Sages would have to be sacrificed to return it to its previous state?

In that case, the Heavenly Dao might as well be destroyed!

Han Jue decided to risk it.

Compared to the Chaotic Will, who was more ruthless?

At most, he would make Ancestor Tian Xu use Life of All.

Life of All was a Dao Destruction Mystical Power, a Destiny Mystical Power. It sacrificed one’s cultivation and providence in exchange for the death of all living beings. It could only be used under a certain Heavenly Dao or calamity. The price was that one’s cultivation level would decrease by a major realm!

Ancestor Tian Xu wasn’t a Heavenly Dao lifeform. The entire Chaos would be affected when he used this move!

This move was basically a life-and-death struggle with the Ninth Chaos!
