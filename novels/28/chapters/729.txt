Chapter 732 Dark Instinct

Life’s voice echoed above the dilapidated Heavenly Court, causing the hearts of the tens of millions of Heavenly troops to shiver.

He had accomplices?

Han Jue immediately used the simulation trial to check his surroundings.

He did not see any other Life appear.

At this moment!

The space behind the South-Heaven Gate suddenly shattered and a huge black hole appeared. Figures slowly stepped out.

(Life: Late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, unknown background)

Han Jue instantly detected their cultivation.

There were a total of thirteen Lives, all with the cultivation of a Great Dao Sage!

Han Jue frowned. He was secretly shocked. Life’s force was already so powerful?

However, he noticed that these Lives did not carry the power of darkness. This way, the Great Dao Sages could show their ability.

These Lives were all different. All of them wore black robes and their bodies were like souls. They were ghastly and terrifying.

The thirteen Lives walked straight towards Han Jue’s palace, their auras rising steadily.

Boom! Boom! Boom…

The palaces shattered one after another. The entire space shattered and was replaced by a purple space. Endless purple mist surged. Immediately after, the purple mist turned into white light and then dark blue. It was extremely strange. This was the Primordial Space. The change in color was only because their Dharmic powers were increasing rapidly.

The thirteen Lives had just taken five steps when twelve figures blocked their path.

It was the twelve Ancestral Magi.

Di Jiang twisted his neck with a sinister expression and smiled. “Brothers, I was suppressed by the power of darkness earlier and felt extremely uncomfortable. It’s time to vent!”

With that, the twelve Ancestral Magi all transformed into their true forms. All of them had terrifying faces and had pythons wrapped around their waists. They were burly.

The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning waved his horsetail whisk and smiled. “It’s indeed time to attack.”

Jie Yin, Nüwa, and the other Great Dao Sages walked forward.

The previous power of darkness had indeed made them very aggrieved. Once their Dharmic powers were used, they were directly neutralized by the power of darkness. How could they fight?

The Life in Han Jue’s hand shouted crazily, “Are you afraid? It’s useless even if you beg for mercy now!”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor, Han Tuo, Zhou Fan, and the others frowned.

The thirteen Lives did not look simple. Even if the Great Dao Sages blocked their way, they could still feel the soul-stirring pressure.

At this moment!

Black light suddenly burst out from behind the thirteen Lives and swept through the entire Primordial Void.

All the Great Dao Sages and the tens of millions of Heavenly troops were swept away before they could react, including Han Jue.

Han Jue felt his vision blur and his surroundings turned dark. It was as if he had arrived at the Dark Forbidden Zone. The surrounding Evil Heavenly Emperor and the others were all gone.

Immediately after, stars lit up in the darkness and quickly formed a starry sky.

Han Jue saw thirteen Lives. To be precise, there were fourteen Lives!

Behind the thirteen Lives was a black shadow that was like a ball of Qi.

“This is my Dark Instinct. It can only be used on existences of the same realm. Only by defeating us can you escape this illusion!” a hoarse voice sounded.

The thirteen Lives spread out and quickly surrounded him.

Han Jue raised his eyebrows and asked, “Will the other Great Dao Sages also face your siege alone?”

The hoarse voice smiled. “That’s right. I’ll give you a chance now. Submit to us and become Life!”

Han Jue asked, “What if I don’t submit?”

Black shadows emerged from his body and quickly rose, forming terrifying huge shadows. They were the Grand Unity Aspect.

“Then die!”

“Kill!”

The hoarse voice immediately ordered. He could sense how terrifying the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols were. Feeling uneasy, he directly ordered.

…

In the Primordial Void.

Han Tuo looked at Han Jue, who seemed to be frozen, and asked in surprise, “What happened?”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned. He looked up and saw that the other Great Dao Sages were also motionless. It was not only the Great Dao Sages, but the thirteen Lives were also the same.

The scene was extremely strange.

The Life in Han Jue’s hand chuckled and said, “This is one of the Dark Instincts. It can pull enemies of the same realm into an independent and true illusion. Every Great Dao Sage will face the siege of Life alone until they die. Do you still want to join forces to resist Life?

“Naive!

“I forgot to tell you. Every Life has its own Dark Instinct!

“You can forget about living when all the Great Dao Sages die!”

Life laughed wildly and was extremely excited as if he could already see Han Tuo and the others kneeling down and begging for mercy.

Zhou Fan looked unhappy and cursed. “I really want to crush him to death!”

Life was a Great Dao Sage, but it was imprisoned in Han Jue’s hand. How could it be killed by him, a Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal? The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned, his heart filled with worry.

Life’s number and abilities exceeded his expectations.

This battle was still too rash!

Damn it…

He even implicated Han Jue.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked up at Han Jue and couldn’t help but be stunned.

Han Jue was actually smiling. He raised his head and said, “Dark Instinct? It’s indeed something!”

The others were stunned. In the next moment, they couldn’t help but exclaim.

“Father!”

“Grandmaster!” “Master!”

They couldn’t believe their eyes. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

How did Han Jue break through Life’s Dark Instinct?

The Life in Han Jue’s hand widened its eyes and exclaimed, “Impossible! Absolutely impossible! How can you break free from this Dark Instinct?”

His voice trembled.

Han Jue put it into his sleeve and walked towards the thirteen motionless Lives. “What’s so difficult about breaking free? I just have to kill all of you.”

Han Jue’s words drifted into the ears of the Evil Heavenly Emperor, Han Tuo, and the others, making them dumbfounded.

In other words, in just ten breaths of time, Han Jue had killed all thirteen Lives in the independent illusion?

Erm…

Even Zhou Fan and Chu Shiren, who trusted Han Jue, were shocked.

How strong was he!

They turned around and saw majestic black shadows rising behind Han Jue.

Yi Tian couldn’t help but ask, “Han Tuo, isn’t that your Innate Mystical Power? So you inherited it from your father!”

Han Tuo looked at the Fiendcelestial Dharma idols above Han Jue with a complicated expression.

One…

TWO…

Four…

Eight…

He had only inherited one, but it was already enough to sweep through his peers. His father, Han Jue, had grasped so many Dharma Idols. How strong was he?

Arriving in front of the thirteen Lives, Han Jue had already summoned dozens of Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols above his head. All of them leaned forward and looked down at the thirteen Lives like dozens of giants squeezed together like they were looking down at ants.

“Impossible! How did you do it?”

The thirteen Lives exclaimed in fear.

As for the Life who had used his Dark Instinct, the black aura he had transformed into kept swaying as if it would be extinguished at any moment.

His Dark Instinct trapped his companions instead.

Han Jue glanced at him. The dozens of Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols above him waved their fists and palms as if the sky was collapsing!

Boom

A terrifying light burst forth, causing all the spectators to close their eyes. Their divine sense was blocked.
