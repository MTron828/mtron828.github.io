Chapter 1110 Out of Control

“Who do you think I am?” Han Jue smiled and asked with his back facing him.

He still had an impression of this prodigy. He had performed well in the first Chaotic Assembly.

One had to know that in the first Chaotic Assembly, although Han Huang had obtained the Eternal Peak, it was not an arbitrary advantage.

Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven gritted his teeth. “Other than Han Huang, there’s actually an existence like you in the Primordial World. Could you be…”

He did not continue.

Because that name had too much influence!

Divine Might Heavenly Sage!

Because the Creation Emperor Court

supported the Chaos, the mighty figures

thought that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage would not interfere. If this was really the

Divine Might Heavenly Sage, he would really be in despair.

In the first Chaotic Assembly, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage had suppressed all the geniuses at that time, including him!

Once he said the name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, all the cultivators present would lose their will to fight.

He knew that he was invincible, so why struggle?

No!

He couldn’t let this go!

Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven roared, “Calamity Life Controller, come and kill this evil devil!”

He could only place his hopes on the Calamity Life Controller. The living beings of the Life faction were all Calamity Life Controllers and were related to the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. They each had different special abilities.

In any case, he was dead. It was better to strive to pose a threat to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!

“Everyone, stop!” Shi Dudao suddenly shouted, causing the Calamity Life Controllers who were preparing to attack to look at him.

Shi Dudao knelt down in the void and shouted respectfully, “Shi Dudao greets the Dark Forbidden Lord!”

Jing Tiangong knelt down as well. Their faces were filled with fanaticism.

Ancestor Xitian sighed and did not stop him.

Half of the members of the Life faction knelt

down. The others looked at each other and were restless, not knowing what to do.

“Dark Forbidden Lord?”

Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven was stunned.

He had naturally heard of the legend of the Dark Forbidden Lord. There were countless of them. Even the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy, which was at its peak, respected the Dark Forbidden Lord.

Not the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?

This did not make sense! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy supported the Chaos, so why did the Dark Forbidden Lord support the Primordial Chaos?

Han Jue smiled. “This little fellow has a huge appetite. Leave quickly if you don’t want to die. I won’t restrain it.”

With that, Primordial Despair roared, as if expressing anger. Don’t ignore it!

Shi Dudao immediately understood and left with the Calamity Life Controllers. Primordial Despair continued to devour the other mighty figures, scaring them away.

In less than a breath of time, only the sound of Primordial Despair chewing the corpses could be heard.

Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven stood rooted to

the ground. He did not expect this attack to

end so quickly.

He was utterly defeated.

The Dark Forbidden Lord actually supported

the Primordial Chaos.

Oh no…

Everything was over…

Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven was ashen.

Primordial Despair continued forward after swallowing the chewed prey in his mouth.

Seeing that Han Jue had no intention of killing him, Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven couldn’t help but ask, “What do you want to do to me?”

Han Jue didn’t answer.

Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven was still

unable to move. The pressure was too strong, causing his soul and Dharmic powers to compress in his body, preventing him from moving. He even lost his sense of the outside world and could not use the Dharma treasures or other methods hidden in the distance.

Primordial Despair continued forward. The rumors of the Dark Forbidden Lord’s appearance quickly spread. This news was too shocking!

The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy was the most

affected.

In the palace of the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy.

Zhao Shuangquan flew into a rage out of humiliation. “Why does the Dark Forbidden Lord support Han Huang?”

His gaze landed on the Nine-Headed Divine

Spirit. The mighty figures of the other Nine Extremes Orthodoxy also looked at him. It was the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit’s suggestion to praise the Dark Forbidden Lord. The Primordial Ancestor God also snorted. He

hated the Dark Forbidden Lord the most, so he was very unhappy with the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy’s method of beautifying him. Although the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit was loyal to the Ninth Chaos, he did not tell him many things.

Yu Yuan said, “We have to suppress the Dark Forbidden Lord. Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable. The nine of us from the Chaos, move immediately!”

He had only inherited the First Chaos’ will

and was not the true First Chaos.

The other Chaos agreed.

The furious Zhao Shuangquan immediately

agreed. They had to hurry up and attack before the news spread to the rest of the Chaos.

…

Primordial Hall.

Han Huang sat at the head of the table and

heard Li Daokong’s story. There was a special communication method between Calamity Life Controllers. He already

knew of the Dark Forbidden Lord’s

appearance.

The disciples of the Hidden Sect also discussed.

“Why is the Dark Forbidden Lord supporting

us?”

“Speaking of the Dark Forbidden Lord, he stirred up the Heavenly Dao back then.” “Junior Huang, you have to be careful if you don’t know the Dark Forbidden Lord. This fellow likes to stir up trouble the most. If you

help us today, you can become our enemy tomorrow.”

“Yes, I’ve often been cursed ever since the Darkness Sect became popular.”

“The Dark Forbidden Lord’s goal is Primordial

Despair?” “It’s very likely. Primordial Despair is so

powerful, but why can we spy on Primordial

Despair but not see the Dark Forbidden Lord

above it?”

Everyone discussed. They were excited, panicked, and uneasy.

The name of the Dark Forbidden Lord was too

resounding.

In fact, the Dark Forbidden Lord rarely made

a move, but he could not stop the many disciples of the Darkness Sect. They fabricated all sorts of exaggerated legends and raised the Dark Forbidden Lord’s strength infinitely. Han Huang did not interrupt but pondered

silently.

He had never seen the Dark Forbidden Lord

and could not even capture him. What did that mean?

This meant that the Dark Forbidden Lord was

very likely stronger than him! Damn it!

Why did so many peerless mighty figures

appear after the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity began?

First, there were four half-step Creators, then

the Nine Chaos, and now the Dark Forbidden

Lord.

Han Huang felt that he had lost control of the situation.

He had underestimated the depths of the Chaos.

If not for the Hidden Sect’s help, Primordial Chaos would probably have lost.

Han Huang stood up and said, “I’ll go personally. All of you, continue to sit and guard the place. Li Daokong will be in charge while I’m not around.”

With that, Han Huang disappeared.

In the broken void.

The advancing Primordial Despair stopped. Nine pillars of light that were unknown in height appeared in front of it. All of them

emitted a terrifying aura as they approached

it.

The Nine Chaos!

They all had the strength of half-step Dao Creators!

If the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was still

alive, he would probably lose his mind!

So many existences stronger than him! “Dark Forbidden Lord, why are you helping the Primordial Chaos?”

Zhao Shuangquan’s voice sounded, clearly suppressing his anger.

Han Jue replied, “Why should I tell you what I want to do?”

“Don’t you know what our Nine Extremes Orthodoxy has done for you?” Zhao Shuangquan’s eyes turned red.

Han Jue asked casually, “I know. What does it have to do with me? A group of dogs that I’ve never seen before come in front of you and wag their tails and stick out their tongues. Do you really think they like you? Isn’t it because you have something to gain?”

“How arrogant! You’re courting death!” Zhao Shuangquan shouted angrily. He erupted with his full aura and charged. The other eight Chaos walked side by side. With every step, his aura increased greatly and broke through

layers of alternate space.
