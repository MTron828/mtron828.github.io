Chapter 252 Becoming an Immortal Emperor, Perfect Immortal Emperor!

In the blink of an eye, thirty years passed.

Under the Fusang Tree.

Dao Comprehension Sword opened her eyes and worriedly looked at the Connate Cave Abode.

Tu Ling’er noticed her expression and asked with a smile, “What are you worried about? Anyone in the world can fail in breaking through, but not Master.”

The others opened their eyes. The Black Hell Chicken smiled. “That’s right, Master is so cautious!”

Xun Chang’an smiled and said, “I’m looking forward to what realm Master can reach.”

They were all very curious about Han Jue’s cultivation level.

It seemed that no matter how strong they became, Han Jue would always be unfathomable.

Chu Shiren stared at the Connate Cave Abode in deep thought. Zhou Mingyue sat beside him and chuckled. “Master, I’m about to break through. Just wait for me to surpass you!”

“Oh? Is that so? Then, I’ll break through too,” Chu Shiren said lazily. He didn’t like to cultivate, but he didn’t want to be surpassed by his disciple.

Zhou Mingyue frowned, secretly unhappy. I don’t believe I can’t surpass you!

Han One looked at Han Eight and asked, “Eighth Brother, when will you break through?”

Among the eight brothers, Han Eight was the most talented. This was publicly acknowledged. He could even be considered the strongest in the Hidden Sect. Only Long Hao could compare to him in terms of talent.

Han Eight said shyly, “Soon.”

Long Hao glanced at him and curled his lips.

This gourd’s talent was truly ridiculous. It even made him, the son of the Heavenly Emperor, feel pressure.

Everyone chatted as they cultivated.

Han Jue’s breakthrough stimulated everyone. They didn’t want to be left behind further and further.

Even the silent Li Yao was secretly exerting her strength.

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

Han Jue had already entered the critical period of his breakthrough, and his soul was still transforming

When his soul completely transformed, he would officially become an Immortal Emperor!

The Six Paths Dharmic powers were also fusing with the Great Dao of Life and Death and the Chaotic Qi!

For some reason, Han Jue felt that the Chaotic Qi in his body was not really Chaotic Qi. This was because he had sensed the Chaotic Qi. Previously, in the Chaotic Domain, the surrounding mist was very likely Chaotic Qi. However, compared to the Qi in his body, there was a difference.

He felt an obvious difference in strength.

His Qi was stronger!

Han Jue didn’t insist on this question. It was fine as long as he was strong enough.

In his body, the Great Dao of Life and Death, the Chaotic Qi, and the Six Paths Dharmic powers wrapped around his soul. With the help of the cultivation technique, they constantly modified his soul.

He fell into an unprecedented state of peace. His heart was as calm as water.

His attention was completely focused on breaking through.

In the Imperial Garden of the Heavenly Court.

The Heavenly Emperor and an old man were drinking in the pavilion. This old man was the old man who had spoken to Dao Sovereign.

He was the master of the Divine Palace.

“Heavenly Emperor, can you let me take a look at your Heavenly Court’s Chaotic Physique?” the master of the Divine Palace asked with a smile.

The Heavenly Emperor teased. “Will you let me meet Dao Sovereign?”

“Haha, you’re still as cunning as ever.”

“Let’s not talk about the younger generation. It will probably take a million years for him to mature. Since you’re here, let’s talk about how to uproot the Demon Court. Although the Immortal World is big, the four overlords are making it too crowded.”

“The Golden Crow Divine Clan has repeatedly invaded our Divine Palace. We can take advantage of the Demon Court they support.”

“I’m very curious. How did you offend the Golden Crow Divine Clan?”

“Nothing. It’s just a conflict between prodigies. Di Hongye is too protective of her children. She’s simply unreasonable.”

The master of the Divine Palace shook his head. He was rather helpless when mentioning

this.

Dr re

The Heavenly Emperor revealed a strange smile. “If you want to blame someone, blame your Divine Palace’s prodigies for being too arrogant. The Golden Crow Divine Clan is just as arrogant.” The two overlords of the Immortal World stopped talking about this and instead talked about how to scheme against the Demon Court.

Seven years later.

Han Jue finally broke through!

Emperor Realm!

Rank One Immortal Emperor!

The Dharmic powers in his body began to increase as his soul sublimated. His Stellar Primordial Body was completely activated as billions of stars resonated.

Boom!

The entire Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain shook violently.

A terrifying aura enveloped everyone from the Hidden Sect. Even Fairy Xi Xuan and Chang Yue’er, who had just returned, couldn’t help but walk out of their cave abodes.

Moved, Xun Chang’an muttered, “This aura… Could it be… How is this possible!”

Immortal Emperor aura! He had also encountered a Buddha who had become an Immortal Emperor in the Buddhist Sect. The pressure back then was unforgettable.

The key was Han Jue’s age!

Xun Chang’an understood Han Jue in this life. He was less than three thousand years old!

An Immortal Emperor less than three thousand years old! Unbelievable!

Xun Chang’an couldn’t control his excitement.

Chu Shiren asked curiously, “Uncle-Master, Grandmaster is?”

The others couldn’t help but look at Xun Chang’an. From his expression, he clearly knew something.

“It’s nothing. Master just broke through successfully. All of you should cultivate well. To be honest, you’re very talented. But compared to him, you’re just mortals, including Junior Long Hao and Junior Han Eight,” Xun Chang’an said seriously. His words moved everyone.

Fairy Xi Xuan and Chang Yue’er couldn’t help but look at each other. They could see the shock in each other’s eyes.

Han Jue’s disciples were extremely talented. Yet, they couldn’t even compare to Han Jue. How talented was he?

On the other side.

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

Just as Han Jue was consolidating his cultivation, three lines of words appeared in front of him.

(Congratulations on becoming an Immortal Emperor. You have the following choices:]

[1: Immediately ascend and sweep through the Immortal World. Your name will shake the heavens and seize great providence. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Mystical Power inheritance, and three Supreme Treasures.]

[2: Don’t ascend for the time being. Continue cultivating and you can obtain two Great Dao Fragments.] Han Jue chose the second option without hesitation.

He didn’t want to ascend!

(You chose not to ascend and obtained two Great Dao Fragments.]

(Congratulations on becoming a Perfect Immortal Emperor. You have obtained three Great Dao Fragments, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, and a Mystical Power inheritance.]

(Congratulations on obtaining the Mystical Power-Great Sun Tathagata Palm]

(Great Sun Tathagata Palm: A Buddhist Mystical Power that uses the power of an Immortal Emperor to suppress all mighty figures. The more negative karma the enemy has, the stronger the effect of this Mystical Power.]

Han Jue’s eyes lit up.

Breaking through a major realm had a reward option. Previously, when facing the choice of becoming an Immortal Emperor, there were also three options.

With the two combined, he obtained five Great Dao Fragments at once! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Most importantly, Han Jue had become a Perfect Immortal Emperor!

What happened to needing the Great Dao and providence?

He had never fought for providence. No matter how strong the providence of the Reroll World was, it was still a mortal world. Could it be related to his Stellar Primordial Body?

Han Jue couldn’t figure it out and could only attribute it to the Stellar Primordial Body.

He continued to consolidate his cultivation. He used his essence soul to leave his body and jumped out of the Reroll World.

He was pleasantly surprised to find that even without a physical body, his essence soul was very strong. Killing Jiang Yi was not a problem. Was this an Immortal Emperor? No wonder he could live forever with just one breath remaining! Han Jue didn’t dare to jump too far, afraid that he would disturb the other mighty figures.

Although he had reached the Emperor Realm, he was only the weakest Rank One Immortal Emperor. His goal of reaching the Zenith Heaven Realm was still far away.

It took eight years before Han Jue’s cultivation finally stabilized.

From this day onwards, he was a true Immortal Emperor!
