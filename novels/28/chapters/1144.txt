Chapter 1146 Consciousnessless’s Ambition, Unknown Power

Ten thousand years passed.

Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at Chu Xiaoqi.

Ever since he helped Chu Xiaoqi, he did not dare to enter seclusion for too long, afraid that if he was not careful, Chu Xiaoqi would be gone.

Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue had already made a name for themselves in the Dao Mystic Realm in the past ten thousand years. They were legendary figures that the Divine Clan of the Immortal World had to look up to.

In Han Jue’s eyes, ten thousand years was like a day. It was very short, but in the eyes of cultivators, ten thousand years was an era.

From the looks of it, Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue had already established themselves. Unless they encountered existences that far exceeded their cultivation realm, it was very difficult for them to die. Behind Chu Xiaoqi was Huang Zuntian, and behind Chen Jue were Han Yunjin and Han Ling.

Han Jue smiled and felt that he was too childish.

He looked at Han Liang. This kid was

cultivating in the Dao Field and following Han Jue. He had already become a Primordial Chaos Sage.

Seeming to sense his gaze, Han Liang opened his eyes. He immediately rubbed his hands and chuckled upon seeing him smiling. “Grandpa, you’re finally awake. When are you letting me out? I’m already a Sage. I’m strong enough!”

Han Jue smiled. “It’s not enough. Your birth destined that your opponent will be stronger than the opponents others encounter, understand?”

Han Liang curled his lips. “I know that our Hidden Sect and the Han family are very powerful, but Uncle-Master Long Hao said that no one dares to provoke us!”

“Don’t listen to him. He almost died outside.”

Han Jue snorted and recounted Long Hao’s experience in the Heavenly Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Han Liang was shocked again.

He did not expect the seemingly gentle Long Hao to be so rebellious.

Han Jue said meaningfully, “This is a path of failure. You have to take it as a warning. I used to think highly of him. Now, I think highly of you the most. Han Liang, you were born extraordinary and are doted on by all. Your starting point is higher than all living beings. Your heart has to calm down. Cultivation is not only cultivation but also heart tempering.”

Han Liang seemed to understand.

He had too little experience. Some things sounded clear, but it was very difficult to understand.

“Then, when can I go out?” Han Liang asked.

“At least become a Great Dao Sage.”

“Great Dao Sage…

Han Liang’s face turned bitter. Great Dao

Sage…

It looked like he was only separated by the Freedom Realm, but it was actually extremely far. After attaining the Dao, he felt that it was very difficult to break through a minor realm. Han Jue ignored this kid and started to check

his emails.

He could observe the entire blank domain, he was used to reading emails. This was one

but

of his few joys.

Han Liang struggled for a while before

continuing to cultivate.

…

The mysterious domain was dark and one

could not even see their fingers.

A head that emitted a faint light was

advancing. It was the Chaotic Consciousness. The eight eyes on his face looked in different directions.

After an unknown period of time, the Chaotic Consciousness finally stopped.

A crimson egg was in front of him. Its surface

was wrapped in countless blood vessels. It

was ghastly and terrifying.

A dragon-like figure swam inside the huge egg. Occasionally, it would change its figure and emit an ancient aura.

“You’re finally here…”

An ancient voice sounded.

The Chaotic Consciousness asked, “What do you plan to do?”

“I can feel that my main body’s will is being controlled by him. Sooner or later, my main body will become his slave.”

The Chaotic Consciousness was silent.

He was taking a huge risk by coming here. “Consciousnessless, there’s still a chance. He might have surpassed the Dao Creator Realm and called himself the Lord, but he has yet to dominate everything. There are too many unknowns in the blank domain. I’ve long

expected this day, so I severed the mental

demon and split it into two. I asked you to come this time to nurture an existence that surpasses the Dao Creator Realm.

“If this existence perishes with all living beings in the blank domain, we can reconstruct everything.”

An ancient voice sounded with an indifferent

tone. The Chaotic Consciousness asked, “Do we really have a chance of winning?” “Are you willing to stop here? You don’t want

to surpass the Dao Creator Realm anymore?” The Chaotic Consciousness fell silent again. He couldn’t refute the ancient voice.

All Dao Creators had ambitions stronger than all living beings. The Chaotic Consciousness’ ambition was greater than the other three Dao

Creators. This was also the reason why he still dared to come after Han Jue became invincible.

Now that the Formless Transcendent Deity

and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity had

already submitted to Han Jue, the remaining Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was useless.

The Chaotic Consciousness asked, “How long will that take?”

“Just wait. It won’t take longer than you

becoming a Dao Creator. The Endless Era

looks bright, but it’s actually the prelude to destruction. Although he surpasses the Dao Creator Realm, he doesn’t understand the

blank domain or how the Primordial Chaos destroyed it. As for me, I created the Chaos.”

The figure in the huge egg suddenly stopped and disappeared. The light of the huge egg converged until it was hidden in the darkness.

“Next, you have to nurture as many talented people as possible and strengthen your force. The stronger, the better.”

The Chaotic Consciousness left.

…

Ultimate Origin World.

The Ultimate Origin World had stopped expanding ever since the Endless Era’s

creation. After fusing with the Purity Great

Dao World, it was definitely the largest world in the blank domain.

The Ultimate Origin World was extremely far

from the center of the Endless Era. Very few living beings were involved in the Ultimate

Origin World, but its legend had already spread in the center of the Endless Era. The Ultimate Origin World’s interior could be

said to be extremely exciting. As the era changed, many experts appeared. Han Ling had discovered the Ultimate Origin

World from the netherworld a long time ago and even nurtured the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential, which was Han Zhiyuan of the Ten Divine Stars.

After that, Han Ling and Han Yunjin joined forces and sent many disciples of the Creation Emperor Court and Han descendants into the

Ultimate Origin World to develop. They discovered that the Spirit Qi in the Ultimate Origin World far exceeded the various worlds and had eight Supreme Rules. This was definitely the most impressive world. They naturally thought of Han Jue.

This was also the reason why they dared to be at ease.

Han Jue didn’t reveal the Ultimate Origin World, and they didn’t ask further. They had a

tacit understanding.

At that moment, a demon was born in the Ultimate Origin World. It wreaked havoc in billions of worlds and looked like it was about

to stir up a calamity. Inside a palace. More than a thousand figures gathered here.

They were the Great Dao Fiendcelestials born

in the Ultimate Origin World. Their cultivation levels had at least reached the Great Dao Sage Realm. There were more than

thirty Great Dao Supremes among them. Such a foundation was very powerful.

The leader was the Life Fiendcelestial. It was one of the few existences that had received Han Jue’s personal guidance. It was also the existence with the highest status in the

Ultimate Origin World and was called the master of the gods.

The Life Fiendcelestial scanned the area and asked, “This demon has unprecedented

power. What do you think?”

The Great Dao Fiendcelestials were all silent.

No one spoke.

That demon was indeed powerful. Many Great Dao Fiendcelestials had already returned in failure. Unless several Great Dao Supremes joined forces, they could not defeat it. After F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

being subdued, this demon could not be destroyed and was truly undying and indestructible. Most importantly, during the period of suppression, this demon was still becoming stronger, making them feel uneasy

and embarrassed.
