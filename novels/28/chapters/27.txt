Chapter 28: Target Is Nascent Soul Realm, Huge Changes

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

To Han Jue, the feud between the Viridescent Nether Cult and the Jade Pure Sect had been going on for decades. In reality, it had been even longer.

The two sects weren’t the only ones in the cultivation world. There were other sects as well. Their enemies weren’t just each other.

It was precisely because of this that the Viridescent Nether Cult and the Jade Pure Sect didn’t dare to make a move. They were afraid that both sides would suffer losses and give the other sects a chance to reap the benefits.

In a dark hall, eight figures were meditating.

Zhang Kunmo was among them.

The leader was a man in a blood-red robe. His hair was black and white, and he had an indifferent expression. He held a horsetail whisk in his hand.

He was Duan Tongtian, Cult Leader of the Viridescent Nether Cult!

“You still haven’t caught Li Qingzi after so long?” Duan Tongtian asked in a deep voice.

The seven elders fell silent.

They had chased after Li Qingzi for nearly twenty years, and each time, Li Qingzi was lucky enough to escape.

Li Qingzi intentionally didn’t return to the Jade Pure Sect. He was acting as the decoy for the sect.

Zhang Kunmo said, “Let’s just ignore him and attack the Jade Pure Sect directly. My disciple was killed there. We put in so much effort on Santian. Aren’t you going to seek revenge?”

He gritted his teeth at the thought of Han Jue.

Back then, he had threatened him. But after so many years, he still hadn’t taken action.

He could even imagine Han Jue mocking him for boasting.

“I think so, too. Our overall strength has already surpassed the Jade Pure Sect’s. We can attack them directly!”

“During the Demonic Path Convention, the other sects have already declared that unless we conquer the neighboring Jade Pure Sect, they will not submit to us.”

“That’s right. If we can’t even defeat a nearby orthodox sect, how can we be the leader of the demonic path sects?”

“I’m willing to lead my disciples to attack the Jade Pure Sect!”

“Other than Li Qingzi, there’s another old monster in the Jade Pure Sect.”

The elders began to discuss amongst themselves.

Duan Tongtian’s eyes flickered, but he didn’t say anything.

After a long time, all the elders stopped and turned to look at him, waiting for him to make a decision.

Duan Tongtian said, “I’m preparing to break through to the Soul Formation realm. Let’s launch the attack after my success. By then, it would be very easy to defeat the Jade Pure Sect.”

Soul Formation realm!

The elders looked at him in shock.

Zhang Kunmo took a deep breath and asked, “Leader, are you confident?”

Duan Tongtian said calmly, “I’ve been preparing for this for decades. I’m 90% confident. Thirty more years, it won’t be long!”

Thirty years!

To mortals, it might be half a lifetime.

But to them, it wasn’t long at all.

...

It had been ten years since Xing Hongxuan left.

Han Jue cultivated his wind cultivation potential to the ninth level of the Golden Core realm and his fire cultivation potential to the third.

Ever since his thunder cultivation potential reached the ninth level of the Golden Core realm, cultivating the other cultivation potentials was twice as easy.

Han Jue already saw the Nascent Soul realm waving at him.

He grew stronger every day. It was a wonderful feeling. So, cultivating in seclusion wasn’t boring at all.

Only by reaching the Nascent Soul realm as soon as possible could one truly emerge from the weak!

Han Jue was already eighty-eight years old, and he was at the ninth level of the Golden Core Realm. In the cultivation world, there was definitely no other person as fast as him.

But he was still unsatisfied.

Even reaching the Nascent Soul realm wasn’t enough. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He wanted to cultivate until the end, until he was absolutely invincible!

One fine day.

Chang Yue’er came to visit.

Han Jue closed the array formation and welcomed her into the residence.

“Junior Brother, I’m here to see you. I also brought you some natural treasures. Planting them by the pool will make the Spirit Qi in your cave abode even richer. In the future, it might become the cave abode with the richest Spirit Qi in the entire Jade Pure Sect,” Chang Yue’er said with a smile.

She walked to the edge of the pool and began scattering seeds.

Han Jue smiled. “Thank you, Senior.”

“Don’t thank me. It was all given to me by Master. I’m just helping out with some manual labor,” Chang Yue’er said with a smile.

Han Jue couldn’t help but think about Fairy Xi Xuan.

He uttered a word of gratitude in his head.

Chang Yue’er continued, “Ever since you went into seclusion, Jade Serene Peak welcomed several new disciples. Junior Iron, who was ranked behind you, passed away two years ago.”

Elder Iron has died?

Han Jue was stunned.

He hurriedly clicked on his interpersonal relationships and realized that he could no longer find Elder Iron’s profile picture.

He was gone.

“Speaking of him, his cultivation potential was so bad. He should have spent his entire life in the outer sect. To be able to come to the inner sect, he definitely had no more regrets. However, before his death, he wanted to see you. His apprentice alchemist told me that.”

“Why did he want to see me?” Han Jue asked with a complicated expression.

He used to hate Elder Iron.

But now that he thought about it, Elder Iron had never hurt him. It could even be said that he had raised him.

Elder Iron’s death caused Han Jue’s disgust towards him to disappear without a trace. He even felt a bit melancholy.

This is the path of cultivation.

People always die on the way.

But, I can’t die halfway!

Han Jue became more determined to pursue immortality.

Chang Yue’er shook her head and said, “How would I know? Did you know each other before?”

Only a few people knew that Han Jue and Elder Iron knew each other. Chang Yue’er wasn’t one of them.

“It doesn’t matter anymore. Senior, cultivate harder. If you die too, I will be sad.”

Han Jue was sincere this time.

After coming to this world, he didn’t know many people. There were even fewer people who had treated him well.

Chang Yue’er turned to look at him and smiled. “Hmph, stinky little junior. I thought you didn’t care about me.”

Han Jue smiled and shook his head.

The two of them started chatting.

Most of the time, Chang Yue’er was the one talking. She described everything that had happened in the inner sect.

Zhou Fan had completely risen up and became an influential figure in the inner sect. He succeeded in his challenge against the eldest disciple of Sword Peak with his Foundation Establishment cultivation. He won over his companion and shocked the entire sect. But on the second day after their wedding, he divorced the woman again. It was a huge controversy.

Currently, Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou had already become the representatives of the Heavenly Thunder Peak. They were both personal disciples, and Mo Fuchou was even a core candidate.

Xing Hongxuan had been cultivating at Main Peak. So, she wasn’t very famous.

“Alright, it’s time for me to go back and cultivate. I’ll try to accompany you on the road of cultivation for a bit longer.” Chang Yue’er playfully smiled and then left.

Han Jue sighed.

Although Chang Yue’er was joking, Han Jue felt sad when he heard her words.

Han Jue was someone who wanted to live forever. Chang Yue’er’s talent was far inferior to his, so she definitely wouldn’t live as long as him!

However, Han Jue wasn’t a pretentious person and quickly adjusted his mentality.

If he had the ability in the future, he could also help those close to him.

For example, Fairy Xi Xuan, Chang Yue’er, and Xing Hongxuan.

Should Mo Zhu be included?

Han Jue pondered silently.

He suddenly raised his right hand and used his finger as a sword to write two words on the stone wall across him.

Elder Iron.

He stood up and bowed at the name.

It was a late farewell.

Hopefully, Elder Iron will be reborn in a good family.

After that, Han Jue continued to meditate and cultivate.

...

It had been another ten years.

Han Jue’s fire and water cultivation potentials had reached the ninth and seventh levels of the Golden Core realm, respectively. He was only left with earth and wood cultivation potentials.

This speed was already amazing, but he was somewhat dissatisfied.

He began to rummage through his Little Universe Belt to check the medicinal pills left behind by Chen Santian.

Chen Santian was also a Golden Core cultivator. Perhaps he had Golden Core cultivation pills.

Unfortunately, no.

This brat’s medicinal pills were mostly poison, aphrodisiacs, and all sorts of despicable drugs.

“As expected of a f**king member of the Cult!”

Han Jue couldn’t help but curse.
