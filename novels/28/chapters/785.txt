Chapter 786 Shame, Dao Companion

The dream was a forest near the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.

Huang Zuntian opened his eyes and saw that it was Han Jue. He immediately stood up and bowed.

“Master!” Huang Zuntian said respectfully.

Han Jue noticed that he had become as sinister as Ancestor Xitian. The transformation of his temperament was visible to the naked eye, and he didn’t have the holy bearing of a Sage.

Han Jue asked, “Why did you cut off the providence of the Heavenly Dao recently?”

He did not ask about Life directly, as if he did not know the truth.

Huang Zuntian replied helplessly, “I was useless. I was attacked and forced to become Life.”

Speaking of this, he wished that there was a hole in the ground for him to hide in.

“Defeated by a few Lives?” “One…” “What realm?”

“Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal…”

Han Jue was speechless.

Huang Zuntian was ashamed and trembling.

He was busy fighting for power. It had been too long since he had fought with someone at the same realm. If he was not careful during the battle, he would be sealed by the other party. Thinking back, he felt so weak.

Han Jue sighed. “It’s not your fault. You’re indeed not talented in combat.”

Huang Zuntian was extremely embarrassed. He wanted to say that he was also talented.

Back then, he was also an invincible existence in the mortal world until he met Han Jue.

He was too ashamed to say anything. He could only bury his face and remain silent.

“In that case, you can hide in the Life faction, just like how you hid in the Jie School. Can you do that?” Han Jue asked.

Huang Zuntian suddenly looked up and said, “That’s what I think. I’ll make up for it!”

Han Jue said, “Protect yourself. If there’s a chance, I’ll think of a way to save you.”

“Don’t. I’ll be really useless if I need your help. Let me hide in the Life faction. If you want to know anything in the future, I can help you obtain information.”

Perhaps I can give you a surprise!

Huang Zuntian did not say this. After all, the Chaos was different from the Heavenly Dao.

Compared to the Heavenly Dao, the Chaos was less calculative. It was more about survival of the fittest.

There’s still a chance things may go wrong! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Wouldn’t it be embarrassing if Huang Zuntian was killed by a brute?

Han Jue said, “Alright, that’s all.”

The dream ended.

Han Jue opened his eyes helplessly. It had to be said that Life was indeed a little powerful.

Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, Ancestor Xitian, and Huang Zuntian were all captured.

Just with the Heavenly Dao alone, in the entire Chaos, how much power had the First Life Black Sovereign accumulated?

“Why aren’t there any powerful Great Dao Supremacies going up to find trouble with the First Life Black Sovereign? They’re all wandering around me.”

Han Jue felt bitter.

Perhaps the First Life Black Sovereign was more dangerous than him, but this fellow had a way to escape.

After all, this fellow grasped the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. Even Pangu couldn’t completely kill him.

Han Jue continued reading the emails.

It was all opportunities and beatings. They couldn’t attract his attention anymore.

Han Jue’s gaze landed on the Hundred Peak Immortal River.

He discovered that the Black Hell Chicken had already become a Pseudo-Sage, but it did not look for him.

He counted with his fingers and shook his head with a smile.

It was because the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, Ah Da, Xiao Er, and the other personal disciples had not reached the Pseudo-Sage Realm. The Black Hell Chicken was waiting for them.

They wanted to find Han Jue together because they guessed that once they found him, they would have to leave the Hundred Peak Immortal River.

More than a million years had passed. These guys were close and could not bear to leave each other behind.

Not bad.

Under Han Jue, the disciples formed different circles. Fortunately, there were no conflicts for the time being.

It was mainly because the Heavenly Dao and the Hidden Sect were both developing and could still grow, so there were no conflicts.

Once the Hidden Sect could no longer expand and they could no longer become stronger, they could only fight for power in the existing factions.

Han Jue was never afraid of internal strife among his disciples.

He could always throw them into the Primordial Heavenly Prison.

At this moment…

Han Jue felt an extremely terrifying aura!

Chaotic Fiendcelestial, Red Fate!

Han Jue immediately used the simulation trial to detect her existence.

[Red Fate: Late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, Chaotic Fiendcelestial. She has a favorable impression of you because you killed the Despair Dao Spirit. Current favorability: 3 stars]

This favorability appeared when the Fiendcelestials gathered. Han Jue didn’t care at that time.

Woman, you deliberately approached me. You must have a motive!

Wasn’t she here now?

Han Jue directly started the simulation trial.

Three breaths later, he opened his eyes and frowned.

He entered the simulation trial again.

A breath later, he opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief.

Killing intent suddenly burst out from Han Jue’s eyes.

Should he just kill this fellow?

To avoid causing trouble for me…

No, the other party did not have any hatred towards him. How could he kill her?

Han Jue never killed his friends.

Moreover, killing Red Fate would definitely attract the Chaotic Fiendcelestials’ attention. It would be harmful but not beneficial.

Fine, then!

Han Jue created a clone and went to see her.

Red Fate was waiting in the Dark Forbidden Zone. Seeing Han Jue appear, she smiled like a flower, enough to topple all living beings. However, in his eyes, her smile was so cunning

Han Jue asked, “Why are you here, Fellow Daoist Red Fate?”

Red Fate covered his mouth and laughed. “Didn’t you invite me? Fellow Daoist Han appeared very quickly. I thought I still had to wait for a while. The Heavenly Dao is really a good place. Even we Great Dao Sages can’t enter without permission.”

Han Jue smiled. “Then there has to be a reason why you came to visit me, right?”

What did she mean?

You still want to barge in?

Han Jue almost pulled out his axe.

“The reason is that I want to be close to Fellow Daoist Han. After living for so many years, only Fellow Daoist Han suits my taste. You’re also a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, so I naturally want to be close to you.” Red Fate smiled and pretended to be coy.

Han Jue was not confused. They were all old foxes who had been around for billions of years.

Even if what she said was true, she probably wanted to cozy up to him. However, Han Jue was afraid of trouble!

“Recently, a special space-time dimension has appeared in the Chaotic Spring. It might contain a great opportunity. Fellow Daoist Han, are you willing to follow me and increase our relationship? Perhaps after this trip, you and I will become Dao companions.”

Han Jue said, “I already have a Dao Companion, and there’s more than one. I’ve had countless fun in the past and have seen through the mortal world. That’s why I’m cultivating so diligently today. I don’t need a Dao Companion anymore. Thank you for your favor, Fellow Daoist Red Fate.”

Red Fate smiled. “It’s fine. I don’t care. Fellow Daoist Han, don’t be in a hurry to refuse. What if you suddenly change your mind in the future?”

Han Jue chuckled. “We’ll talk about it in the future.”

“Then, are you going?”

“Forget it. It’s too far from the Heavenly Dao. I’m afraid of death.”

“You’re afraid that I’ll harm you? How is that possible?”

“Even if Fellow Daoist Red Fate doesn’t harm me, what if I encounter enemies? What if I encounter a Great Dao Supreme on the way and he doesn’t like the two of us?”

“Your thoughts are really strange. How can a Great Dao Supreme be so easy to encounter? Furthermore, why would they attack without caring about karma?”

Red Fate shook her head and laughed, feeling that he was more and more interesting.

Han Jue was helpless.

Since she had already said so, how could he not understand? Must they fall out?
