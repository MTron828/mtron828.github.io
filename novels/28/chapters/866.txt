Chapter 867 Formless Transcendent Deity

“What is it?” Han Jue asked patiently. He blamed the Evil Heavenly Emperor in his heart.

What’s our relationship? Do you have to beat around the bush?

The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “I’m preparing to explore the Chaotic Domain. I already have a goal. However, this domain has a powerful restriction and needs the help of a Great Dao Sage. I only know two Great Dao Sages. One is suppressed and the other has disappeared. I can only look for you.”

Speaking of this, the Evil Heavenly Emperor sighed.

Han Jue said, “Summon me.”

“Alright!”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not say anything else. The dream ended.

Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “Will I die if I help the Evil Heavenly Emperor?”

...

(No]

Safe.

Han Jue was relieved. In any case, he had left his will in the Daoist temple. He could be revived even if he died outside. The question just now was mainly to consider if he would provoke a Great Dao Supreme existence. But it shouldn’t be from the question’s value.

Han Jue continued to comprehend the power of creation and waited for the Evil Heavenly Emperor to summon him.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor used the Invocation Technique to summon him several days later.

A black vortex appeared in front of Han Jue and he stepped in.

In an instant, he arrived in the Chaos.

He stepped out of the black vortex and saw the Evil Heavenly Emperor.

Beside him stood a man in silver armor. His aura was oppressive.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor immediately smiled upon seeing him. He cupped his fists and smiled. “It’s my honor to have the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s help.”

Behind the two of them stood rows of Heavenly troops. There were at least ten million of them.

All the immortals of the Heavenly Court looked at Han Jue in reverence. The name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage had long spread throughout the Chaos. He had killed 20,000 Divine Authority Generals with a single strike, which was equivalent to 20,000 Great Dao Sages being no match for him. Such strength was considered unique in the eyes of all living beings. He was even regarded as the strongest by many cultivators. He was so powerful that even the rules could not restrain him.

Han Jue said, “You’re still talking about these formalities. Could it be that His Majesty wants to flatter me?”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “I have no choice. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s name is too grand. I don’t dare to be impudent. Let me introduce you. The person beside me is called the War Buddha, a Buddhist spirit from the Buddhist World. He’s Chu Shiren’s disciple and also your grand-disciple.”

Hearing this, the silver-armored man beside him hurriedly bowed very respectfully.

Han Jue glanced at the War Buddha and said, “Your potential is not bad. I’ll teach you a Mystical Power after this matter is over.”

“Thank you, Heavenly Sage!” the War Buddha said excitedly and hurriedly bowed.

“Oh?” Han Jue raised his eyebrows and looked unhappy. The War Buddha was stunned. “Thank you, Grandmaster!”

wa

Han Jue finally smiled.

The Heavenly troops behind them were in an uproar.

They didn’t expect the Divine General to be the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s grand-disciple!

Han Jue turned around and looked at the void ahead.

He already felt a powerful restriction that even ordinary Great Dao Sages would probably find difficult to break.

He used the simulation trial and did not discover any powerful enemies.

“How is it? Can you break it?” the Evil Heavenly Emperor asked with a solemn expression.

Han Jue didn’t answer. He just took out the Primordial Judgment Sword and slashed out.

Without the sword Qi, the void in front of him was instantly slashed into two. A white light split the darkness into two. Immediately after, it began to shatter with the white light as the center.

Boom

Space shattered and violent winds wreaked havoc. The Great Dao lightning was extremely domineering.

Han Jue raised his hand and easily blocked all the wind and lightning for the Heavenly Court.

The space ahead began to collapse as seven-colored light burst forth.

Han Jue narrowed his eyes and looked over. A world was revealed after the restriction shattered.

This world was vast, a hundred times larger than the entire Heavenly Dao. Boundless vitality spread out, making one intoxicated.

Han Jue scanned with his Sage Sense and discovered countless living beings in this world, but no Sages. The strongest was only a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.

There were many Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals, but they did not transform. They were like ferocious beasts walking on the ground.

“That’s right, the legendary first world of the Chaos!” the Evil Heavenly Emperor said excitedly. Han Jue glanced at him in surprise.

He hurriedly explained, “Actually, the Chaos developed naturally before Pangu created the world. However, it disappeared later. The appearance of this world gave Pangu the idea, so he created the world later.

“Although the Immortal World is not the first world, with the rules of the Heavenly Dao, it has already surpassed the first world of the Chaos.”

Han Jue asked, “How did you find this place?”

The Chaos had countless such restrictions. Under normal circumstances, even Great Dao Sages did not dare to rashly barge in. They were probably the Dao Field of other Great Dao Sages. How could the Evil Heavenly Emperor predict that there was no Dao Field behind the restriction?

The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “Of course, I was guided by an ancient existence. However, I can’t tell you this ancient existence’s name.”

nan

Han Jue’s expression didn’t change, but he was shocked.

Could it be the Chaotic Consciousness?

“Thank you, Heavenly Sage. There’s no need to trouble you next. In the future, the Heavenly Dao’s Chaotic Heavenly Road can also be expanded here and teach the living beings here.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled.

Han Jue nodded and stepped into the black vortex. A beam of light flew out and entered the War Buddha’s forehead before he disappeared.

The black vortex disappeared.

Han Jue had already returned to the third Dao Field.

He sat on the mat and first used the simulation trial to check his surroundings. He was only relieved after confirming that no mysterious existence followed him to the Dao Field.

Han Jue asked in his mind, “Who told the Evil Heavenly Emperor about that world just now?”

(1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Dao Creator!

[Formless Transcendent Deity: Cultivation unknown, Chaotic Deity, Above Order, Transcends Everything. Unspeakable Name.]

It was actually not the Chaotic Consciousness…

Han Jue frowned.

He asked, “How many Dao Creators are there?”

Could it be that there were seven like the Supreme Rules?

(Five]

Han Jue was deep in thought.

Ninth Chaos, Chaotic Consciousness, Formless Transcendent Deity, and two unknown existences.

It was not many, but it was not few either.

Furthermore, the five of them had already escaped the Chaos. All living beings didn’t know this.

Han Jue asked again, “Be it in the Chaos or outside, is the Ninth Chaos the strongest existence?”

(100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue! [For the time being.) It should be now.

Han Jue set a goal to surpass the Ninth Chaos.

The ceiling was right in front of him!

However, the Ninth Chaos was not his ultimate goal. He still had to break through to the Creator Lord Realm after surpassing the Ninth Chaos.

He wanted to constantly rise to newer heights!

Han Jue was excited just thinking about it.

Wait.

The Formless Transcendent Deity told the Evil Heavenly Emperor about the number one world of the Chaos. Was he going to interfere in the situation of the Chaos?

That had to be the case!

Han Jue asked in his mind, “Why did the Formless Transcendent Deity help the Evil Heavenly Emperor?”
