Chapter 801 Talking to Myself

Ten thousand years passed.

Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at the Great Dao Tower first. After so many years, the Great Dao Tower regained its peace and prosperity. Zhou Fan was still cultivating in the tower.

Compared to ten thousand years ago, the number of living beings in the Great Dao Tower had doubled. Han Jue counted with his fingers and couldn’t help but smile.

It turned out that the news of him defeating Ancestor Xitian had already spread. Many living beings who hated or were afraid of Life felt that the Great Dao Tower could protect them and went there.

It was not only the Great Dao Tower. The Heavenly Dao and the Heavenly Court were also affected. However, the Heavenly Court had a very high threshold for the Heavenly troops. They would not accept ordinary living beings. Unlike the Great Dao Tower, the Heavenly Court was more like an army.

Han Juels gaze landed on the Heavenly Court. After the Heavenly Court gained a reputation from Life, the number of immortals increased greatly

It had to be said that the Evil Heavenly Emperor was still very good at using his reputation and power.

Han Jue was no longer worried upon seeing that the Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower were fine.

He looked at Chu Shiren’s Buddhist World

The Buddhist World had used a special array formation and was actually hidden in deep space-time. Only Great Dao Sages and existences above could spy on it.

Han Jue noticed an aura of freedom in the Buddhist World.

Eh?

Chu Shiren had really succeeded?

He checked his profile picture.

The portrait was still there, which meant that he had not been possessed. The favorability had not changed, which meant that he had not been brainwashed. Everything was normal.

Chu Shiren was interesting.

Han Jue began to look forward to what he would do in the future.

Then, Han Jue sent a dream to Li Daokong and asked about his recent situation.

Although Li Daokong was very loyal, there was a possibility that something would happen if he was left alone. Li Daokong might be experiencing torture and struggling when Han Jue was still cultivating.

In the dream, Li Daokong was indeed very excited and happy to see him.

Li Daokong and the other two suffered immense pressure in the Life faction after the defeat with the Great Dao Tower. Li Daokong and Shi Dudao were very aggrieved, but they had no choice.

After becoming Life, he could barely escape the fate of the Calamity Life Controller. This was also the first time Li Daokong had experienced the torture of the Calamity Life Controller. It was truly a fate worse than death.

Han Jue asked, “I can save you and help you eliminate the Calamity Life Controller’s karma if you can’t take it.”

Li Daokong was stunned and pleasantly surprised.

He had felt despair when he understood the true terror of a Calamity Life Controller. He didn’t expect Han Jue to help him resolve it.

He believed that Han Jue was not bragging. After all, so many lives had been lost in his hands.

He hesitated for a moment and gritted his teeth. “It’s fine, Sect Master. I can still tolerate it. Furthermore, my cultivation speed has indeed far exceeded before by relying on my identity as a Calamity Life Controller. This is also my opportunity.” Han Jue said, “Don’t feel burdened. Use the Invocation Technique to summon me at any time once you can’t hold on, understand?”

Li Daokong nodded. “I understand. Thank you for your concern, Sect Master.”

The two of them chatted for a while more before ending the dream.

Han Jue sent a dream to Shi Dudao next. This time, he used the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord.

Shi Dudao was also suffering. He was tortured by the Calamity Life Controller’s fate. He wanted to show his cards several times, but he was afraid that he would appear weak and be looked down on by the Dark Forbidden Lord.

His dissatisfaction instantly dissipated upon seeing the Dark Forbidden Lord.

He secretly admired him.

The Dark Forbidden Lord appeared when he was about to collapse. Wasn’t it to give him hope and motivation? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Shi Dudao was still convinced even though he knew that this was a method.

At the very least, it meant that the Dark Forbidden Lord really cared about him and he was not a pawn that could be abandoned at any time.

Han Jue said bluntly, “I can help you escape and find a place to cultivate in peace if you can’t take it.”

Shi Dudao asked, “Then, can I still follow you?”

“Yes, but it’s another form of following.”

Shi Dudao understood.

The other was to rear him and wait for the opportunity when he was needed.

He didn’t want this!

Han Jue said meaningfully, “Shi Dudao, in my opinion, your talent is the strongest. You didn’t lose the battle against the Evil Heavenly Emperor. After all, there’s a difference in cultivation. Your talent continues to be released as your cultivation realm increases. One day, you will become an existence even more dazzling than the Great Dao Divine Spirit.

“However, every supreme expert has to experience pain and despair before they can continue to grow and climb higher.”

Shi Dudao nodded. He also believed this.

However, the Dark Forbidden Lord said that he was the most talented. This made him very excited.

He indeed thought so before leaving the Heavenly Dao.

However, he had seen too many geniuses after wandering in the Chaos for so long. He had thought that he was very mediocre, especially after being crushed by the Evil Heavenly Emperor. He doubted himself even more.

Usually, there was Li Daokong, this dog, beside him. If it were anyone else, they would also be easily heartbroken.

Shi Dudao suppressed his excitement and asked, “Really?”

Han Jue said, “I have no need to lie to you. Your talent is not determined by my mouth. If there is a talent stronger than you, why don’t I look for him?”

Shi Dudao felt that it made sense.

“In that case, I’ll continue to hide in Life. I want to be your most capable War God!” Shi Dudao said proudly and regained his previous conceit.

Han Jue smiled in satisfaction.

The dream ended an hour later.

Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.

He smiled in satisfaction.

He was still very talented in bluffing. Han Jue started to check his emails next.

In the Daoist temple next door.

Xing Hongxuan was meditating on the bed when she suddenly frowned.

Her consciousness entered a dream.

After a while, she opened her eyes and she discovered that she was standing beside a lake. Immortal Qi surrounded her and the scenery was beautiful.

“Dream?”

Xing Hongxuan frowned. She was already a Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. How could she be dreaming?

She subconsciously touched her abdomen. She had always felt something unfathomable ever since she got pregnant.

She knew that her son was not simple. She was also worried that her son would attract danger, but she had no choice but to endure.

Suddenly realizing that she couldn’t leave the dream, she began to observe her surroundings.

Clouds surrounded her, preventing her from seeing where she was.

At this moment.

A figure walked towards her on the lake.

Soon, the figure walked out of the clouds and revealed her true body.

Xing Hongxuan was stunned.

The other party looked identical to her, but her temperament was more extraordinary.

Xing Hongxuan wore white and stood on the lotus throne. The sun and moon floated behind her and surrounded her like gods.

Xing Hongxuan stared at her and sized her up carefully.

The other party slowly said, “Don’t let your son be born. He will attract unprecedented trouble. Even your husband can’t stop him.”

Xing Hongxuan frowned. She seemed to have thought of something and asked, “Are you the future me?”

The other party said slowly, “There’s no future or past. I’m just talking to myself. You have to choose between your son and your husband.”
