Chapter 297 Stupid Little Brother, Duan Hongchen

Han Ming?

Who?

Han Jue was stunned when he saw this line of words.

He immediately checked Han Ming’s profile picture.

(Han Ming: Late-stage Grand Unity Mystic Immortal Realm, descendant of an Immortal Emperor. His elder brother, Han Jue, was chosen by Immortal Emperor Samsara to become his descendant. Because of this, he was highly regarded by Immortal Emperor Samsara and was reborn from a mortal to an immortal. Because he knew that everything had happened because of his elder brother, Han Jue, he became jealous. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]

What the hell?

My younger brother?

Han Jue was stunned.

The providence of an Immortal Emperor descendant that the system had produced was actually arranged in this manner. It had unknowingly made Immortal Emperor Samsara choose him. This was a little impressive.

Han Jue wasn’t grateful to Immortal Emperor Samsara. He was also grateful to the system.

As for this younger brother, Han Jue didn’t care.

His parents had abandoned him when he was young. The reason why Immortal Emperor Samsara chose Han Ming was probably that he saw that Han Jue was rising and wanted another pawn to restrain him.

You want to use this stupid brother to threaten me?

Impossible! Han Jue smiled disdainfully and couldn’t be bothered with the other party.

Han Ming was only a Grand Unity Mystic Immortal and could not threaten him.

Not to mention Han Ming, Han Jue didn’t even think much of Immortal Emperor Samsara. After all, he was also an Immortal Emperor himself.

He had even cultivated the Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao, which was stronger than the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique.

After cursing all the enemies, Han Jue didn’t stand up and continued cultivating.

Although the powerful enemy, Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor, was already dead, Han Jue still had to work hard to become stronger. His target was to become a Rank Four Immortal Emperor!

In the vast void, in a sun star. Flames swept across the surface of the planet like purgatory. In one place was a huge palace with two huge three-legged Golden Crows at the entrance.

The hall was also burning with True Sun Flame, but none of the decorations had been burned.

Figures stood in the hall, including Jiang Yi.

Sitting at the head of the table was a mighty figure with a bird head and a human body. He wore a crimson red robe and had a terrifying aura.

The Golden Crow Divine Clan’s Patriarch, Di Lantian!

“Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor has perished. Who has he been chasing after recently?” Di Lantian asked with a cold tone.

Jiang Yi was the first to speak. “He was chasing after a friend of mine. However, that person’s cultivation level is weak and he’s not an Immortal Emperor. Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor should have been killed by another mighty figure.” The others nodded.

Previously, when Jiang Yi was killed by the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor, it had caused quite a stir in the clan. They were all prodigies worth the Golden Crow Divine Clan nurturing with all their might. It was a pity no matter who they lost.

Di Lantian narrowed his eyes. “Did the Golden Crow Divine Emperor die in the netherworld?”

An old man nodded and replied, “Yes, I asked the King of Hell. He’s in seclusion and said that he doesn’t know. Ksitigarbha was attacked by the Devil Ancestor earlier and didn’t have the time to care about the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor.”

The others guessed.

Jiang Yi was displeased when he heard that. “So what if he’s dead? Patriarch, as long as you give me time, surpassing the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor is not difficult at all. I will bring prosperity to the Golden Crow Divine Clan!”

Di Lantian narrowed his eyes at him and smiled. “What do you plan to do in this calamity? Dodge or enter?”

“Of course I’ll enter!”

“Aren’t you afraid of death?” “The reason why elites are elites is that they are alive. If I die, it will mean that I’m not the destined one of the Golden Crow Divine Clan!”

Jiang Yi was filled with confidence. With the death of the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor, he was the strongest prodigy of the Golden Crow Divine Clan. No one could compare to him.

Di Lantian smiled meaningfully.

“In that case, I’ll give you a mission. Go to the netherworld and find the Ancestral Magus Tower! Destroy it!” Di Lantian said.

Jiang Yi agreed without hesitation.

The others were in an uproar.

Ancestral Magus Tower!

They couldn’t help but recall the long-standing hatred between the Magus Race and the Golden Crow Divine Clan.

Time passed.

In the blink of an eye, another thirty years passed.

Han Jue’s cultivation level improved again. The speed at which the Stellar Primordial Body absorbed the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus’s negative karma was also constantly increasing. The Rank Four Immortal Emperor Realm was no longer far away. Every ten years, Han Jue would spend a month taking care of his enemies. However, only Golden Roc Demon Lord’s cultivation level kept decreasing. It was very difficult for the Demon Emperor, the Heavenly Dao Buddha, and Li Xuan’ao to be affected by the curse.

Han Jue wasn’t in a hurry. Life was good like this.

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and cursed the enemies again.

While cursing, he checked his emails.

The Heavenly Court seemed to have fought with the Demon Court again. They attacked and were severely injured. Xing Hongxuan had quite a few fortuitous encounters. It seemed that the Golden Kite Sacred Vein’s bloodline was not simple. He didn’t know how this woman was doing recently. She was too far away, and Han Jue couldn’t understand her recent situation.

Several days later, Han Jue was still cursing the enemy.

(Detected bearer of Connate providence, check its origin.)

Han Jue raised his eyebrows and immediately chose to check.

It had been a long time since he had seen someone with Connate providence. Hundreds of years.

Now, there was no one in the Reroll World with a system-certified Connate providence.

The threshold of Connate providence also increased with Han Jue’s cultivation.

[Duan Hongchen: Rank One Immortal Emperor. Born in the face of calamity. Reincarnated Ancient God. He once participated in the Immeasurable Calamity and died. His remnant soul and the negative karma were suppressed in the netherworld. After countless years of evolution, his body was born from negative karma. His remnant soul gained intelligence and could absorb negative karma to become stronger, but he could not digest negative karma himself.]

Eh?

Born in the face of calamity?

Wasn’t the person facing the calamity Ji Xianshen?

Could it be that more than one person was facing the calamity?

Han Jue immediately checked Duan Hongchen. This fellow was actually slowly rising towards the sea in the Yellow Spring.

To prevent any accidents, Han Jue still followed Duan Hongchen to a simulation trial.

Too close!

But still an instant kill!

I have no worries.

Han Jue didn’t look for Duan Hongchen. He should stay away from such a calamity lest he got involved in it.

A pair of eyes opened in the dark Yellow Spring. These eyes were so clear and bright as if they could expel all the filth in the world.

“I’m finally awake,” a muttered voice sounded. He suddenly rushed out of the Yellow Spring, and the water of the Yellow Spring shot into the sky.

Duan Hongchen also revealed himself. He was naked and had a perfect figure. His muscles were well-defined and his white hair fluttered in the wind.

He raised his right hand, and the water of the netherworld rose up from below. It wrapped around his body and condensed into a yellow robe. A crown that looked like a dragon horn appeared on his head, looking sinister and domineering.

Duan Hongchen twisted his waist and opened his arms. A slightly sinister smile appeared on his handsome face as he muttered, “Hao Tian, I’ve already revived. I’ll fight for the Heavenly Dao before you!”

He smiled confidently.

He was about to leave when he suddenly sensed something and turned around.

His gaze locked onto a small reef in the distant Yellow Spring Sea. “Eh?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Surprised, Duan Hongchen muttered, “The God of Misfortune, why is he here?”

With that, Duan Hongchen flew towards Hidden Sect Island.

He smelled something bad the moment he was born. He couldn’t help but smile.

How exciting!
