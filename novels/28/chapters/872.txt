Chapter 873 Jiang Jueshi’s Terror

Another one?

Han Jue was helpless. Although he only had two children, it was already enough to give him a headache.

His eldest son, Han Tuo, was outside and refused to go home. His youngest son’s potential was too strong and was stuck in his mother’s womb for millions of years.

Han Jue said, “Haven’t I already created so many living beings for you? Isn’t it enough to relieve your boredom?”

Qingluan’er said coquettishly, “How can they be compared to my own child? Besides, you’re so powerful. Aren’t you going to think of a way to have more descendants? Not to mention that you’ve surpassed the Freedom Realm, most of the powerful people in the mortal world have more than two children.”

Han Jue hesitated.

Qingluan’er continued to persuade him. “Husband, I’ll take care of the child since you usually cultivate in seclusion.”

Han Jue couldn’t dissuade her and felt that it was feasible.

With his current cultivation level, there were not many existences in the Chaos that he was truly afraid of. It was not troublesome to have a few more children.

“Fine.”

...

“Husband is the best!”

Qingluan’er pounced into his arms and started to pull his clothes.

Han Jue was speechless. “So urgent? The battle outside the universe isn’t over yet!”

“You’ve already surpassed the Freedom Realm. What are you afraid of? Your disciple is a major realm weaker than you. Even he can resist the Inauspicious Evil. At that time, you can wave your hand and the black mist will probably disperse.”

“You’re quite open-minded.”

“Of course. I’ve never been worried ever since I married you. Anyway, I’m not afraid even if the sky falls with you protecting me.”

“Forget it, forget it. As you wish.”

Outside the universe of stars.

Jiang Jueshi sat in the void and a huge shadow that emitted a dazzling light condensed behind him. This huge shadow was similar to him. It spread its arms and its Dharmic powers transformed into white rings of light that swept in all directions. The white rings of light directly dispersed and were unstoppable the moment they touched the black mist.

Liu Bei stood beside Jiang Jueshi and looked at him in a daze.

“This kid’s potential…”

Liu Bei was envious and shocked.

Han Jue had mentioned to him that Jiang Jueshi’s potential was terrifying, but he didn’t expect it to be to this extent.

At first, the two of them were still being suppressed by the Inauspicious Evil, but as they fought, Jiang Jueshi comprehended it. He used the Great Reincarnation Creation Technique to create a providence Mystical Power that could suppress the Inauspicious Evil.

Using providence to suppress the enemy!

Powerful!

Liu Bei was stunned as he stared at Jiang Jueshi’s side profile.

For some reason, he thought of Han Jue.

Although the two of them looked completely different, their calm aura before the battle was too similar. It made people involuntarily relax, as if as long as they were around, all danger would disappear.

Liu Bei did not disturb Jiang Jueshi and waited for him to comprehend the Dao.

Jiang Jueshi killed the Inauspicious Evil as he comprehended the Dao. He was like a true god in the sky, insufferably arrogant.

A cry suddenly came from the black mist, “Who are you?”

Jiang Jueshi did not answer. Instead, he raised his right palm and pushed forward.

The huge shadow above him waved his palm. The dazzling light on his body turned into a pillar of light and rushed over, directly destroying the black mist near the direction of the sound.

After an hour, the black mist near the universe of stars was completely dispersed. The mysterious existence did not say anything and quietly left.

Jiang Jueshi slowly opened his eyes.

“Not a bad Mystical Power!” Jiang Jueshi muttered to himself, extremely excited.

Although he often created Mystical Powers, those that could destroy Inauspicious Evil were definitely ranked in the top three.

Liu Bei praised him. “Fellow Daoist Jiang, what a good Mystical Power.”

Jiang Jueshi smiled. “Do you want to learn it? I can teach it to you. More Inauspicious Evil will definitely attack again in the future.”

“Really?”

“We’re brothers. Why would I lie to you?” “Thank you, Fellow Daoist Jiang!”

“Hahaha, what are you saying? You’re welcome.”

“True.”

The two of them looked at each other and laughed. They were both in a good mood.

Inside the Daoist temple.

Qingluan’er and Han Jue tidied their clothes. Qingluan’er rubbed her abdomen and looked happy.

Han Jue could see that she was already pregnant.

Because he already had two sons, Han Jue deliberately chose to conceive a daughter this time. Her potential was at most comparable to Han Tuo. Qingluan’er’s cultivation was too weak. Han Jue even sealed her bloodline potential, just like he did to Han Tuo back then.

A third Primordial Fiendcelestial couldn’t be born with Xing Hongxuan’s son around.

Han Jue said, “By the way, she can only be ranked third if my daughter is born. I have a wife who is also pregnant with a son.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qingluan’er was stunned when she heard that. She couldn’t help but ask, “Where is she? Why isn’t she with you?”

She was not angry or jealous. It was normal for men to have multiple wives in the Immortal World. As long as they were strong enough, even women could have many husbands.

Moreover, five million years had passed and she was already dead. It was not unreasonable for Han Jue to find another wife.

“In another Dao Field. She’s busy cultivating,” Han Jue replied.

Qingluan’er smiled. “Then, it seems that I have to work hard. I can’t let you think that I like to slack off.”

Han Jue smiled and touched her head. “I’ll go back to cultivate. The battle outside has ended.”

Qingluan’er nodded and walked out of the Daoist temple.

Han Jue smiled.

He was looking forward to his youngest daughter.

Qingluan’er gave birth to her daughter in Han Jue’s Daoist temple a year later. She didn’t feel any pain with her cultivation level. She was fine after giving birth.

The youngest daughter was very lively. Her cries were loud, causing the other living beings outside the Daoist temple to discuss. They all knew that the queen was about to give birth to a daughter, and they were also looking forward to it.

Han Jue rarely ended his cultivation early. He took his swaddled daughter and showed an expression of adoration.

“Did we disturb you?” Qingluan’er asked.

Han Jue smiled. “It’s fine. I’ll spend a hundred years watching her grow up. It’s fine.”

Qingluan’er was pleasantly surprised. Han Jue said, “Let’s call her Han Qing’er. What do you think?”

Qingluan’er understood the meaning of the name and smiled happily, nodding in agreement.

“I’ll bring you back to the Immortal World to have fun when she starts to learn. You’ve been revived for so long, it’s indeed boring. It’s been hard on you.”

“It’s good that you know.”

Qingluan’er curled her lips. She was indeed a little aggrieved. She had the mentality of a mortal before. Who could withstand letting a mortal cultivate alone for a hundred thousand

years?

However, Han Jue could say it. Her grievance instantly turned into sweetness.

Then, Han Jue and Qingluan’er walked out of the Daoist temple and introduced their daughter to the other living beings in the third Dao Field. These living beings were very excited and wanted to hug Han Qing’er.

Just like that, Han Qing’er grew up happily being loved by many people. Although her potential was sealed by Han Jue, she was still outstanding. She could fly at the age of one and breathe in Spirit Qi at the age of three to cultivate.

At the age of five, she had already reached the Nascent Soul realm.

On this day, Han Jue brought Qingluan’er and Han Qing’er to the main Dao Field.

The five-year-old Han Qing’er wore a green lotus dress. Her small face was exquisite and cute. She had inherited Han Jue’s appearance. Although it was still inferior to Han Jue, it was enough for her to be loved by everyone.

Han Jue first brought the mother and daughter to the Daoist temple next door to see Xing Hongxuan.
