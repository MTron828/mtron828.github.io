Chapter 1128 Mortal Cultivation Path

Facing Chu Xiaoqi, who was smiling like a pig, Han Jue asked, “Then, are you willing to marry Xiaohua?”

Like young girls, it was normal for youths to yearn for love.

Chu Xiaoqi scratched his head. “How can I cultivate if I get married? In the future, won’t I have to help her cultivate? If her potential is not good, she might even drag me down and distract me. No, I shouldn’t get married. There are many beauties in this world.”

Han Jue chuckled. “You just like her beauty?”

!!

“Nonsense. I haven’t even interacted much with them. How can I fall in love with them at first sight?”

“As long as you’re happy.”

“Grandpa, how did you get married back then?” Chu Xiaoqi sat beside Han Jue and asked curiously.

Han Jue smiled. “Back then, I was a herb garden servant and an outer disciple of a cultivation sect. I happened to meet a female cultivator…”

He told the story of him and Xing Hongxuan. Xing Hongxuan was a spy, but she met Han Jue by chance and fell in love with him at first sight. After that, she pestered him every day. She also repeatedly gave him treasures. Such a story fascinated Chu Xiaoqi.

He had always heard that men chased after women, but it was rare for women to chase after men.

He couldn’t help but look at Han Jue. Such looks were indeed liked by girls. Even his two sisters secretly asked him about Han Jue.

Chu Xiaoqi suddenly clapped his hands and said in shock, “I’ve decided. I can’t marry easily in the future. I want beauties to pursue me. I’ll marry whoever is the most sincere!”

Han Jue found it funny and didn’t discourage him.

Who could say for sure about the future?

Han Jue could see the future, but he wouldn’t look easily. That would make things meaningless. He only needed to be vigilant and wary of the future. As long as there was a possibility that the future threatened him, he would check it. He had such foresight as the Creator Lord.

Of course, he still had to take the time to check his fate every once in a while.

“Grandpa, aren’t you curious about my other brother?” Chu Xiaoqi changed the topic.

Currently, other than Chu Xiaoqi, there were two sisters and three brothers in the family. They were still missing one.

Han Jue asked, “If you want to say it, say it.”

Chu Xiaoqi chuckled. “I want to cultivate because of my big brother. I’ve never seen him since I was young. He also went out to search for immortals when he was very young and never returned. A few years ago, he replied that he had joined the Darkness Sect. We all thought that he had been deceived.”

Darkness Sect…

Han Jue was not surprised to hear this name.

The Darkness Sect collapsed and began to disperse after the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended. The Dao Creators didn’t kill all their members because Han Jue had told the Formless Transcendent Deity that there was white and there was black. If he killed the Darkness Sect, other sects would appear. It was better to keep the remaining members pave the way for another Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity in the future.

and

Instead of choosing the disciples of the various families, it was better to let the evil descendants continue to be evil.

Of course, Han Jue was still thinking for Shi Dudao, Jing Tiangong, and the others. The Formless Transcendent Deity also felt that it made sense.

Many mighty figures of the Darkness Sect

were killed. Only a few people related to Han

Jue survived.

From this point of view, Han Jue was very selfish.

But so what if he was selfish?

He was the strongest. He decided everything.

Who had the right to blame him?

It was only a rule set to protect the same level

of benefits.

Chu Xiaoqi told Han Jue about his brother for a while and only left late at night.

Chu Xiaoqi was still glorious in the following

days. He didn’t even have time to cultivate. He either helped the hunters kill spirits and beasts or taught the children in the town to cultivate.

Han Jue didn’t stop him. He would occasionally go out for a walk. At first, the people were surprised by his appearance, but later, they got used to it.

In the blink of an eye, half a year passed.

Chu Xiaoqi found Han Jue again and said, “Grandpa, I want to cultivate. Let’s leave.”

Han Jue didn’t even open his eyes. “Should we part for now or forever?”

Chu Xiaoqi was stunned.

He fell silent and then understood what Han

Jue meant.

He was different from mortals after becoming

a cultivator. His family did not have the

potential to cultivate. If he stayed, not only would it delay him, but he might also cause trouble for his family in the future. There was also the parting of life and death. It

was even more exciting.

After a long while…

Chu Xiaoqi clenched his fists. “Forever.”

…

At dawn.

Chu Xiaoqi left a letter. Before leaving the

town, he even went to see Xiaohua. In the

end, he severed his mortal thoughts and left with Han Jue.

“Grandpa, should we go back and cultivate?”

“I don’t have to go back. I can walk around.”

“Alright! I also want to see if the world is

exciting. Do the cultivation sects you mentioned really exist?”

“Do you want to join a sect? It’s a good opportunity to train.”

“What will happen to you, then?”

“I’ll find a place nearby to hide and cultivate.”

“Wuwuwu. Grandpa, you’re the best! I’m so touched that I’m crying! I’ll kidnap a beautiful nun for you when I join the sect.

She’s definitely the most beautiful fairy in the

sect!”

“Hehe.”

One rode a cloud and the other on a sword.

They flew side by side and laughed as they flew towards the horizon. Three months later, they came to a cultivation

sect. Han Jue asked Chu Xiaoqi to join them while he opened a cave abode in the nearby forest.

“I’ll only teach you cultivation. I won’t

interfere if you encounter danger. You have to rely on yourself.’

Han Jue warned him before leaving.

Han Jue couldn’t help but look at Chu Xiaoqi

as he sat in the cave abode.

Chu Xiaoqi was already at the Foundation Establishment realm, so it was naturally not difficult for him to enter the sect. The most powerful expert of this sect, the sect master, was only at the Soul Formation realm.

Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, Soul Formation, Void Amalgamation, Fusion, Tribulation Transcendence, Mahayana…

Han Jue couldn’t help but recall his cultivation years.

Chu Xiaoqi first became an outer sect disciple. With his cheerful personality, he quickly made a group of good friends. The cultivation technique Han Jue taught him was stronger than the cultivation techniques in the mortal world. Therefore, in less than

three years, Chu Xiaoqi passed the inner sect assessment and was chosen by an elder.

The elder was very curious about his cultivation technique, but everyone had their own opportunities, so he did not force him to

hand it over.

Chu Xiaoqi began to encounter trouble after

entering the inner sect. One of his brothers

had his Dao Companion snatched by a genius. Later, he was murdered while training outside. Chu Xiaoqi was furious and also became enemies with that prodigy. This prodigy was the personal disciple of the

Sect Master, but Han Jue could tell that he was actually an illegitimate son.

On the surface, the Sect Master did not care

about this matter, but if it really reached the point of no return, Chu Xiaoqi would definitely die. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Han Jue looked forward to Chu Xiaoqi’s next performance.

How would he overcome this obstacle? However!

‘Grandpa! Someone wants to kill me. Save me!”

Chu Xiaoqi came to visit Han Jue and cried on

his lap. He was clearly grown up, but he was

deliberately acting like a child.

Han Jue could clearly tell that this kid was not really crying. He was just pretending. Furthermore, no one was chasing after him.
