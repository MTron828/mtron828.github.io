Chapter 207 Ancient Spiritual Ginseng Awakens

Above Scarlet Cloud World, in the void.

Flame Lord Emperor was expressionless as he stared at an imposing monk emitting a Buddhist light.

This dignified monk was the Dragon Subduing Buddha. He was wrapped in a golden dragon and had strong muscles. He was very domineering

“Amitabha. Fellow Daoist, are you really not letting me pass?” the Dragon Subduing Buddha said coldly, his tone filled with threat.

Flame Lord Emperor smiled disdainfully. “This is our Heavenly Court’s mortal world. How can you enter as you wish? Even if we fight today, the gods of the Heavenly Court will definitely arrive soon. The Heavenly Court has yet to settle scores with the Buddhist Sect after the calamity hundreds of years ago. You came knocking on our door!

“Make your move! Let me experience the power of the Divine Buddha!”

Facing the fearless Flame Lord Emperor, Dragon Subduing Buddha frowned.

He didn’t expect him to be so rash. In the current Immortal World, who did not give the Buddhist Sect face?

The eyes of the Dragon Subduing Buddha turned cold. He snorted. “Flame Lord Emperor, this karma is not resolved!” The Flame Lord Emperor smiled disdainfully.

On the other hand, Han Jue was in the simulation trial.

After a long time, He opened his eyes and sighed. “The Divine Buddha is quite impressive!”

The late-stage Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm Dragon Subduing Buddha was actually stronger than the perfected Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm Di Taibai. In the end, Han Jue barely managed to kill the Dragon Subduing Buddha, but only his soul remained. The outcome was tragic.

I can’t provoke the Dragon Subduing Buddha easily!

Han Jue thought silently.

He checked the location of the Dragon Subduing Buddha again and discovered that he had already left.

Han Jue took out the Heavenly Dao Token and searched for Xun Chang’an.

He found him in no time.

Han Jue’s expression became strange.

Xun Chang’an was sitting by the sea, facing it. His body emitted a Buddhist glow and his temperament had changed. Although he was still ugly, under the sacred aura, he was no longer so disgusting.

Xun Chang’an’s cultivation level had actually soared to the Tribulation Transcendence Realm!

What happened?

Han Jue immediately used his divine sense to probe Xun Chang’an.

He wasn’t possessed, but there was a golden pearl hidden in his body. Could it be a Buddhist relic?

At this moment.

Murong Qi flew over from afar.

He landed in front of Xun Chang’an and said, “Master, her corpse has been buried.”

Xun Chang’an slowly opened his eyes and sighed.

Murong Qi consoled, “Master, this calamity is already over. You don’t have to think about her anymore. You didn’t owe her anything, it was her who wanted too much.”

Xun Chang’an said faintly, “Why can’t reincarnation change human nature?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Murong Qi didn’t answer.

If reincarnation could transform a person’s personality, would it still be the same person?

“Master, what do you plan to do next?” Murong Qi asked.

Xun Chang’an said, “Let’s go home.”

Murong Qi smiled.

He had always wanted to go home. Where was home?

Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain!

Han Jue heard their conversation and couldn’t help but become even more curious.

Xun Chang’an’s love tribulation had been broken?

Forget it.

He would ask when this guy returned.

Han Jue put down the Heavenly Dao Token and sighed. “My disciples and grand-disciples are all old enough. They all have their own lives.”

Dao Comprehension Sword asked curiously, “Master, what are you doing?”

Han Jue smiled and asked, “Nothing. When you attain the Dao, will you leave the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain?”

Dao Comprehension Sword said in surprise, “Leave the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain? Where will I go? I was born here. I won’t go anywhere unless you leave, Master.”

Ever since she awakened, Dao Comprehension Sword had never thought of leaving.

Her world was very simple: cultivation.

Han Jue shook his head and laughed. This question was too early for Dao Comprehension Sword.

Then, he took out the Book of Misfortune and continued cursing the enemy.

A year later.

Xun Chang’an and Murong Qi returned.

Long Hao, who had already grown up, and Zhou Mingyue were very curious about them. They sat under a tree and chatted happily.

Xun Chang’an had changed too much. The Buddhist light on his body kept spreading out like he was an immortal.

The Black Hell Chicken snorted. “Qian’er died again?”

Xun Chang’an glanced at it and didn’t speak.

Murong Qi sized up Long Hao and asked curiously, “What realm are you at?”

They already knew each other. Murong Qi was very curious about this Little Uncle-Master.

For some reason, as soon as he saw Long Hao, he felt his blood boil, as if he had encountered a lifelong enemy.

Long Hao said proudly, “I’m already a Loose Immortal.”

Murong Qi was silent. A Loose Immortal in his forties…

Fang Liang consoled, “Senior, don’t compare yourself with him. We can’t compare.”

Long Hao smiled proudly. “If you encounter any trouble in the future, feel free to look for me. I’m your Uncle-Master!”

Everyone continued chatting and listened to Murong Qi talk about his experiences over the years.

The two Golden Crows also listened intently.

After chatting for several hours, the sky turned dark.

Tu Ling’er asked curiously, “What do you think our lineage should be called? We’re not disciples of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.”

Among everyone, only Murong Qi and Fang Liang took up the positions in the sect. The others only followed Han Jue.

“Indeed. We have already grown stronger and can be completely independent.” Fang Liang nodded.

Not to mention Han Jue, just Fang Liang and Murong Qi were enough to look down on the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.

The Black Hell Chicken chuckled. “How about Chicken Sect?”

Everyone turned around and glared at it.

Ah Da flapped his Golden Crow wings to the ground.

“Master, what do you think?” Fang Liang asked.

Xun Chang’an didn’t speak the entire time. He felt extremely uncomfortable because Chu Shiren had been staring at him, causing him to shiver.

He said, “We can only listen to Master.”

At this moment, the cave abode door opened and Han Jue and Dao Comprehension Sword walked out.

Long Hao immediately came over and said excitedly, “Master, you’re finally out. When are you going to teach me your Mystical Power?”

Han Jue sized him up and sighed. “In the blink of an eye, you’re already so big. I’ll teach you my Mystical Power tomorrow.” Long Hao was handsome and looked like the son of the Heavenly Emperor. They looked very similar.

Long Hao had the best relationship with the Three-Headed Wyrm King on the mountain. The others were busy cultivating, and only the Black Hell Chicken and the Three-Headed Wyrm King had the time to play with him.

The Three-Headed Wyrm King had already reached the peak of the Mahayana Realm and could transcend the tribulation at any time.

Han Jue came in front of Xun Chang’an and asked, “How have you been?”

The moment he saw Han Jue, Xun Chang’an’s suppressed emotions finally erupted.

His eyes instantly turned red. He lowered his head and choked. “Master… I feel bitter…”

In front of Murong Qi, he had to maintain his role as the master. Only when facing Han Jue could he let go of the burden in his heart.

Xun Chang’an began to wail, no longer as imposing as before.

Han Jue felt a little sad seeing this.

This was still his disciple, after all.

In the cultivation world, master and disciple were like father and son.

Han Jue helped Xun Chang’an to the edge of the cliff and sat down.

Murong Qi hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Everyone, cultivate separately. Stop looking!”

Everyone nodded, but during the cultivation process, they listened intently.

Long Hao was the most curious. Why was this Senior Brother crying so sadly?

He sat beside the Three-Headed Wyrm King and asked with a voice transmission.

The Three-Headed Wyrm King replied in a meaningful tone, “He has encountered the most difficult trial in the world.

“Love.”

Long Hao was even more puzzled.

Love? Why? At the edge of the cliff, Xun Chang’an began to complain to Han Jue, who listened patiently. [Detected that the Ancient Spiritual Ginseng is awakening. You have the following choices:]

(1: Stop Xun Chang’an from awakening and let him continue to fall into the love tribulation. You can obtain a Supreme Treasure.]

[2: Help Xun Chang’an awaken and escape the love tribulation. It will attract the Buddhist Sect’s attention. You can obtain a Supreme Treasure.)
