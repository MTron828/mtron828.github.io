Chapter 756 Ultimate Dao Treasure!

Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease after cursing for five days. The end of the lifespan number jumped quickly, but it wasn’t affected much compared to the entire string of numbers.

Han Jue could feel how strong his curse was. Ordinary Sages probably didn’t even have the right to deduct his lifespan.

This feeling of doing whatever he wanted was too satisfying!

It was as if this book could kill all enemies in the world!

10 billion years!

100 billion years!

A trillion years!

100 trillion years!

1 quadrillion years!

10 quadrillion years!

Han Jue finally saw an email.

[Because of your curse, the Dao heart of your enemy, the First Life Black Sovereign, was damaged.]

Interesting

Very tough.

Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and didn’t continue cursing.

It was still useful to keep the First Life Black Sovereign alive. The Life faction could help him attract attention. It wasn’t good to kill him early.

Of course, he might not be able to kill the First Life Black Sovereign if he continued cursing

Han Jue put away the Book of Misfortune and started the simulation trial.

Forty-nine years later.

Han Jue ended the simulation trial and called Dao Comprehension Sword into the Daoist temple.

Dao Comprehension Sword sighed as she walked into the Daoist temple again.

Everything was still the same, but her heart was no longer the same. What would have happened if she didn’t go out everywhere?

Dao Comprehension Sword didn’t dare to think about it. Compared to the past, the greatest change was the distance between her and Han Jue.

In the past, she had little knowledge and didn’t have so much reverence. Now that she had been in the mortal world, she developed reverence and couldn’t talk to Han Jue like before.

Dao Comprehension Sword knelt down respectfully.

Han Jue said, “Have you made up your mind?”

It wasn’t difficult to guess Dao Comprehension Sword’s intentions.

She probably knew why Li Yao, Murong Qi, and the others had disappeared.

Dao Comprehension Sword looked up and said, “I’m ready. Master, please fulfill my wish.”

Han Jue didn’t say anything else. He directly destroyed her body and placed her soul into the Primordial World.

Before Dao Comprehension Sword could react, she discovered that her surroundings had changed. Her body was gone.

“What’s going on… Why does Master want to kill me?”

Dao Comprehension Sword was filled with despair and disbelief.

She listened to the Black Hell Chicken and prepared to offer herself, but she actually angered Han Jue.

Forget it.

So be it if she died…

Dao Comprehension Sword closed her eyes and prepared to welcome her fate.

Anyway, her life was given to her by him.

Han Jue didn’t know what Dao Comprehension Sword was thinking. He chose one of the Fiendcelestial Qi and helped her fuse with it.

Then, he came to the second Dao Field and let Yang Du out.

Yang Du landed in front of the Daoist temple as if a lifetime had passed.

He was already an acquaintance of the second Dao Field, so Han Jue didn’t inform Murong Qi to fetch him.

However, Murong Qi sensed Yang Du’s aura and took the initiative to come.

“Congratulations on finally becoming a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.” Murong Qi patted Yang Du’s shoulder and smiled, looking as if he thought highly of him.

Yang Du was very excited. He turned around and bowed to the Daoist temple before leaving with Murong Qi.

This was his first time becoming a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. He still had many things to ask Murong Qi. The latter told him everything he knew and was very patient, making his admiration for him grow.

No wonder Han Jue chose Murong Qi to be the leader of the Fiendcelestial Army!

His bearing was indeed impressive.

Han Jue didn’t leave the second Dao Field immediately but looked at the Earth Immortal World.

He suddenly discovered that Ren Gang and Yin Hongchen were no longer in the Earth Immortal World or even the Heavenly Dao.

He counted with his fingers. The two of them had followed the Reincarnation Space into the Chaos tens of thousands of years ago and had never returned.

Han Jue didn’t care. He had chosen the Fiendcelestial candidates because of a sense of danger. Now that he had become stronger, he was no longer in a hurry to expand the Fiendcelestial Army.

Being unable to become a Chaotic Fiendcelestial was only a pity for Ren Gang and Yin Hongchen. Han Jue could replace them. There was no lack of replacements in the Hidden Sect.

“What are you looking at?” Li Yao asked curiously.

Han Jue came back to his senses and smiled. “Nothing.”

Li Yao suddenly pressed his hand down and said softly, “Don’t be in a hurry to leave.”

Han Jue asked, “What is it?”

Li Yao blushed. “I need your help to increase my cultivation.”

Han Jue remained silent.

Seeing that he did not object, Li Yao immediately started taking action.

The Daoist temple was immersed in love. Unless one was the Great Dao Supreme, they could not be spied on.

Time passed.

Another hundred years passed.

Han Jue slowly opened his eyes. After messing with Li Yao for twenty years, he returned to continue cultivating.

Ten thousand years had passed, but his cultivation level had not increased much, making him quite regretful. The cultivation difficulty increased again after he had reached the mid-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm.

Han Jue took out the Heaven-Opening Axe. It had been successfully upgraded.

A terrifying killing intent erupted, fluttering Han Jue’s long hair. It shocked him so much that he immediately suppressed this killing intent, afraid that he would accidentally injure the Hidden Sect disciples.

So powerful!

Compared to before, it was like the Dharma treasure couldn’t be compared to its past self at all.

In his opinion, the previous Heaven-Opening Axe was not even a Chaotic Supreme Treasure. It was just hard and heavy enough.

The current Heaven-Opening Axe made him, a Great Dao Sage, feel heavy. The killing intent it contained was extremely shocking.

Even without using the Primordial Divine Rage, he was confident that he could kill Hatred Concubine with just a swing of this ахе.

Han Jue checked the Heaven-Opening Axe’s information.

[Heaven-Opening Axe: Ultimate Dao Treasure, one of the Birth Dharma treasures of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial Pangu. Number one killing weapon. It has the power to devour the providence of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials and can split the world.)

Ultimate Dao Treasure! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Number one killing weapon!

How arrogant!

Han Jue put away the Heaven-Opening Axe and entered the simulation trial. He wanted to test its power right away.

In the Dark Forbidden Zone, the light formed by the Chaotic Heavenly Road split the darkness into two. High above, a majestic palace floated.

In the hall, Pan Xin was meditating.

Usually, when he had nothing to do, he liked to cultivate in the Chaos and protect the Chaotic Heavenly Road.

He suddenly opened his eyes and took out the Heaven-Opening Axe. The Heaven-Opening Axe in his hand petrified at a speed visible to the naked eye, causing cracks to appear.

Shocked, Pan Xin hurriedly used his Dharmic powers to repair it, but to no avail.

Boom

The Heaven-Opening Axe turned to dust and dissipated in front of him.

“How can this be?!”

Pan Xin was dumbfounded.

This was a Supreme Treasure passed down to him by Giant God Pangu. Back then, he had relied on this treasure and the Chaotic Green Lotus to kill his way in and out of a group of Great Dao Sages. He had been as impressive as he could be.

How could such a Supreme Treasure turn to dust?

Pan Xin pinched his fingers to deduce. He couldn’t deduce where the Heaven-Opening Axe was or why it was shattered.

Pan Xin was depressed.

His Dao heart also cracked.

At this moment, Emperor Xiao’s voice came from outside the Daoist temple, “Fellow Daoist Pan, recently, a force has appeared near the Chaotic Heavenly Road.”

Pan Xin suddenly stood up. His terrifying aura directly shattered his Dao Field. Wisps of flames wrapped around his body.

Outside the hall, Emperor Xiao was shocked and subconsciously retreated.

Seeing the murderous Pan Xin, he became even more nervous.

He suddenly recalled the scene when Pan Xin killed his way back to the Heavenly Dao.

Had this fellow gone mad?

“Very good! Life, right? I’ll go meet them now!” Pan Xin shouted in a low voice. His voice was like thunder. With that said, he disappeared, leaving Emperor Xiao bewildered.
