Chapter 762 Ultimate Supreme Treasure! Ten Million Years!

After Fang Liang asked, Sect Master Tian Jue, Qiu Xilai, and Zhang Guxing also stared at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du excitedly.

The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was a shadow that enveloped the entire Chaos.

All the cultivators knew that it was coming, but they didn’t know when it would arrive or what situation it would arrive in.

If the Heavenly Dao had the hope of breaking through the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, wouldn’t it become the center of the entire Chaos after it ended?

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said expressionlessly, “Of course it’s fake, but what’s fake can also become true. I just don’t want anyone to press the Primordial Fiendcelestial on the Heavenly Dao and cause it to be attacked.

“We can’t rely on Fellow Daoist Han for everything. Other than strength, there are many other ways to resolve the calamity.”

The four Sages were silent.

Fang Liang cursed silently, I knew it.

What Primordial Ten Sages? It only sounded nice.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du continued, “I’ll tell you the legend of the Primordial Ten Sages now. Remember it well.”

The four Sages had strange expressions. You even made up a legend?

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du did not seem to see their expressions and continued speaking.

Less than five thousand years later, the legend of the Primordial Ten Sages spread in the Heavenly Dao and then from the Chaotic Heavenly Road to the Chaos.

Legend had it that the Primordial Ten Sages were the ten mighty figures, including the Dao Ancestor. They had subdued the reincarnated Luo Hou of the Primordial Fiendcelestial and disappeared without a trace. Before the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, they would reincarnate and cultivate the Great Dao again. They would be the saviors, killing the Primordial Fiendcelestial.

This legend excited countless geniuses.

The geniuses all thought highly of themselves. Tracing their talent would create a fantasy.

Could they be the reincarnation of a mighty figure?

The Heavenly Dao had already formed the momentum to find the Primordial Ten Sages, but it still required a long time to spread to every corner of the Chaos.

More than ten thousand years later, Han Jue was still cultivating.

[Detected that you are 800,000 years old. You have the following choices:)

(1: Exit seclusion immediately. Raise the reputation of the Primordial Fiendcelestial and stir up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. You can obtain a chance to upgrade the Dao Field.)

[2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]

Eight hundred thousand years old!

How old.

Han Jue ignored the system’s trap and silently chose the second option.

(Congratulations on obtaining the Ultimate Supreme Treasure—Mystical Destiny Book]

[Mystical Destiny Book: Ultimate Supreme Treasure, a Supreme Treasure formed by seizing a supreme creation. It can tamper with the past and future of others and directly change everything. It is not restricted or spied on by any rules, but it cannot erase the existence of the Great Dao and its rules. Every time you use this treasure, your lifespan will be deducted at an equivalent price. This treasure will be unusable for a period of time. As the number of times it is used increases, its cooldown time will increase exponentially. Special hint: This treasure cannot be upgraded and cannot recognize a master.]

What the heck!

Han Jue blinked.

Ultimate Supreme Treasure…

Did he obtain a golden legendary treasure?

Han Jue carefully checked the treasure’s introduction, and his breathing quickened

He could directly change everything!

Too arrogant!

Han Jue took out the Mystical Destiny Book, and a white cover book appeared in his hand. It was smooth and cold.

Opening the book, it was filled with blank pages. It was ordinary.

“This thing is not easy to use. I don’t know how much lifespan I have to use. Don’t suck me dry.”

Han Jue frowned.

[The system can help you use this treasure. This treasure is one of the strongest Supreme Treasures contained in the system. You have to be extremely cautious when using it.]

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing this line of words.

One of the strongest Supreme Treasures?

One of?

Changing everything directly was invincible in Han Jue’s opinion.

What else could compete with it?

Han Jue carefully probed, “How much lifespan will be deducted if I want to become the strongest person in the entire Chaos?”

(Warning. You cannot withstand the immense creation brought by this change. You will immediately die.)

That’s not right.

How can I die if I’m already the strongest?

[You will die before you become the strongest in the process of changing.) Han Jue frowned.

So it was useless.

It was even more useless than the Book of Misfortune!

According to the system’s explanation, Han Jue might already be the strongest if he wanted to become the strongest.

Han Jue suddenly thought of how the Beginning Deity had sent the Great Dao Sages to the Heavenly Dao to investigate the Primordial Fiendcelestial.

Can I use a fake identity so that all living beings will never think that I am a Primordial Fiendcelestial?

Han Jue’s heart beat faster.

This was a good idea!

He had to ensure his safety first before considering becoming stronger.

After all, the Primordial Fiendcelestial was the entire Chaos’ public enemy! “I want the living beings of the Chaos to think that I’m absolutely harmless!”

(Warning. You cannot withstand the immense creation brought by this change. You will immediately die.]

“I want the Chaotic Deities to have a favorable impression of me.”

[Warning. You cannot withstand the immense creation brought by this change. You will immediately die.)

Alright, alright!

“I want all the living beings in the Chaos to believe that I’m the reincarnation of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.”

The Chaotic Fiendcelestial was already the lowest threshold. The potential Han Jue displayed was too terrifying. It was too ridiculous to say that his potential was lower than that of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. It didn’t make sense.

Ordinary living beings might not realize this blind spot, but Han Jue felt that with the Chaotic Deities’ existence, they would definitely notice this and continue to investigate. In the end, it would speed up the exposure of his Primordial Fiendcelestial identity.

(Half of your lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?) Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Half?

Han Jue’s eyes widened and he almost threw the book to the ground.

It was indeed not a good thing!

However, Han Jue still didn’t give up.

His lifespan would be refreshed as long as he broke through. He had to protect the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s secrets first.

Han Jue gritted his teeth and chose to continue.

The Mystical Destiny Book emitted a dazzling light. Han Jue felt a terrifying suction force pulling something out of him.

It was his lifespan!

Han Jue came back to his senses after an unknown period of time. Unprecedented exhaustion surged into his heart.

A hint of fear appeared in his eyes as he looked at the Mystical Destiny Book again.

This thing was too terrifying. Putting aside the price, just the ability was very addictive.

Han Jue checked the book’s cooldown time.

“Ten million years?”

Han Jue was stunned.

He didn’t know if he should be happy or disappointed.

He was happy that he would not be addicted but disappointed that such a Supreme Treasure had a long cooldown time.

The cooldown time would increase exponentially after each use.

Wouldn’t he have to wait for a hundred million years or even longer after using it a second time?

Han Jue put away the Mystical Destiny Book, and his Sage Sense swept through the Heavenly Dao.

All living beings did not change. Everything was as before.

Was this a change?

Han Jue suddenly thought of something. “Do the Chaotic Deities have a similar Supreme Treasure?”

(Ultimate Supreme Treasure cannot be deduced.]

He thought of a voice he had heard a long time ago.

Transcend the illusion… It would indeed be a lie if everything could be changed. What was a real existence that could not be altered?

Han Jue adjusted his state of mind.

He couldn’t be affected by the Mystical Destiny Book. This treasure looked terrifying, but it required too much cultivation. The price paid was not something that the Book of Misfortune could compare to.

Using the Mystical Destiny Book to kill enemies might not be as worth it as the Book of Misfortune. It was better to do it himself.

If this treasure fell into the hands of other living beings and their cultivation levels stagnated, the user would probably die after using it two or three times.

Or maybe, like Han Jue before, they would directly want to become the strongest and die immediately. After all, the other cultivators did not have the system’s notification.
