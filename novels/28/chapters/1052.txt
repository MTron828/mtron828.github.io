Chapter 1053 Han Huang Battles Han Jue

Five million years passed quickly.

Han Jue opened his eyes and habitually sensed

his cultivation. He was satisfied with his

growth.

!!

Then, he sent a voice transmission to Han Huang outside the Daoist temple.

His second son had returned hundreds of thousands of years ago and wanted to visit him, but Han Jue was in seclusion, so he could only wait outside.

Han Jue was very satisfied with this. Although this kid was powerful, he was not arrogant. He still had to be polite to him.

Han Huang quickly entered the temple and bowed to Han Jue, also waking up the Shan’e cultivating at the side.

Han Huang also noticed Shan’e. He was secretly curious. Had his father nurtured another seedling?

However, this cultivation and aura were too weak. There was also that gaze. He actually felt

afraid when he saw him. He was afraid before the battle and did not have the heart of an expert.

Han Huang secretly felt disdain.

Han Jue smiled and said, “Huang’er, how many years has it been since you returned? Almost a hundred million years, right? I thought you had already forgotten your parents.”

Han Huang said in shame, “I’m busy becoming stronger and haven’t fulfilled my filial duty. Father, please punish me.”

“Oh? How?” Han Jue asked with a faint smile. How could he not see Han Huang’s suppressed fighting spirit?

Brat, you actually want to challenge me!

Be careful not to break your Dao heart!

Han Huang’s eyes burned. “Why don’t you teach me a lesson in the simulation trial?”

Han Jue laughed.

Shan’e looked at Han Huang with a strange gaze, making him very uncomfortable.

Ever since he sparred with Han Jue, he couldn’t have such thoughts anymore. He felt that Han Jue was the strongest existence.

Han Jue smiled and said, “Then come!”

His eyes narrowed. The two of them immediately entered the simulation trial.

In the simulation trial, in the void.

The father and son were a thousand feet apart. Such a distance was like a step for those with their cultivation levels.

Han Huang looked at his father and his blood boiled.

“Father, do you know how long I’ve been looking forward to this? Although I’m invincible in the Chaos, I always know that

you’re stronger. You’re the peak I want to reach. The Ultimate God of Punishment is not

my match. Those within Shi Tian,

Transcendent, and Consciousness are all existences that can’t match me. Now, it’s time

for me to challenge you!

“I’m not betraying you. I just want to pursue the strongest!” Han Huang said with a burning gaze. The Primordial Purple Qi erupted from his body like a pillar of flames.

The four Supreme Rules of Chaos,

Consciousnessless, Transcendent, and Shi Tian

formed four purple dragons that wrapped

around his body. The dragon scales were actually the scales of the Great Dao.

Han Jue smiled. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Han Huang immediately attacked. He slapped out with his palms and the violent Divine Might Great Heaven Palm struck out, colliding with Han Jue with unstoppable force.

However, the Supreme Treasure on Han Jue’s body emitted a strong light and easily blocked

it.

Han Huang’s expression changed as he

continued attacking.

However, no matter what Mystical Power he

used, what method he used, or where he

attacked, he couldn’t hurt Han Jue.

“How can this be?!”

Han Huang had imagined countless situations

when he fought with his father. He had thought that he would lose, but he did not expect that he couldn’t even break through the defense of

his father’s Dharma treasure.

Impossible!

Where did the four Great Dao Worlds get such a powerful defensive Supreme Treasure?

It was simply unheard of!

Han Huang gritted his teeth and said in a low

voice, “Father, you really surprised me. In that

case, I’ll get serious!”

Boom-

He began to mobilize the Ultimate Origin

Power.

Han Jue clearly felt the Ultimate Origin Power in his body being extracted. Although it was very weak, this feeling was extremely strange.

Because the person who borrowed his strength was right in front of him.

In that case, I’ll let you experience unprecedented power!

Han Jue began to relax. Endless Ultimate Origin

Power erupted from Han Huang’s body, surprising and shocking him.

“This is…”

Han Huang was overjoyed. Could it be that his

father had given him too much pressure, causing him to surpass his limits? Sensing an unprecedented vast power, an

arrogant and conceited expression appeared on his face again.

He looked down at Han Jue and laughed. “Father, do you feel it? This is my strength. It’s

what I’ve obtained in the past hundred million years!

“If I cultivate diligently like you, I’m afraid it’ll be difficult for me to reach it. The Primordial

Fiendcelestial was born to fight. It’s not something that the Chaotic Fiendcelestial can compare to!”

Looking at his ecstatic son, Han Jue smiled and

said, “The Primordial Fiendcelestial is indeed stronger than the Chaotic Fiendcelestial. Be it potential or strength.”

The Ultimate Origin Power within him was still increasing. Han Huang was obsessed with this extreme strength. He smiled and said, “Father,

you’ve finally admitted it. Then, do you think I’ve already surpassed you?”

Han Jue asked with a strange expression, “Do

you really think a Chaotic Fiendcelestial can give birth to a Primordial Fiendcelestial?” Moved, Han Huang asked in surprise, “You…”

Han Jue’s expression became extremely terrifying. He said coldly, “Huang’er, today, I’ll let you experience the true power above the Great Dao Supreme Realm. I won’t show mercy. I hope that your Dao heart can stabilize. This is your path to the strongest!”

An Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal appeared above

Han Jue’s head and quickly expanded, becoming endless.

Han Huang looked up. His divine sense expanded infinitely, but he couldn’t keep up

with the speed at which the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal expanded!

Soon, he felt that the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal had already exceeded the size of the Chaos and was still expanding, as if it was splitting the entire simulation trial space into two.

Han Huang looked incredulous.

What kind of power was this? Boom!

The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal descended

with a terrifying might. Han Huang instinctively wanted to dodge, but he discovered that he couldn’t jump out of the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal. He could only move repeatedly under it.

“Why is this… It’s impossible for it to be

infinitely big! It’s impossible for it to have no end! Could it be the rules of space? “If it’s the Space Rule, what kind of rule is it?

The Supreme Rule?”

Han Huang panicked completely. He had never panicked before.

He had never been forced into such a situation.

The opponent’s strength made him despair. Defeat was right in front of him!

At this moment!

The Ultimate Origin Power in Han Huang’s

body increased again!

This time, the Ultimate Origin Power was too

powerful, causing his body to tear apart and

emit wisps of red light. His soul was about to jump out.

“A power that even the Primordial Fiendcelestial can’t withstand. I don’t believe I can’t break through this seal!”

Han Huang’s expression turned sinister. He roared angrily and punched upwards. The Ultimate Origin Power carried the four

purple dragons formed by the Supreme Rules and soared into the sky. It was peerlessly powerful, as if it could even penetrate time and chaos, causing time to reverse and turn immortality into ashes!

Boom-

This strike collided with the endless Ultimate

Origin Heaven Seal, but it looked so pale, powerless, and tiny!

Under Han Huang’s despairing expression, his mysterious power was crushed by the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal and vanished.

“No-“

Han Huang roared angrily as the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal landed.

He suddenly woke up and saw Han Jue and Shan’e.

The simulation ended.

He had lost. He was utterly defeated!

He gasped. The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal

was still vivid in his mind, making him shiver.

His eyes were bloodshot and his hands were trembling.

Shan’e looked at this ancestor sympathetically and thought to himself, “He’s still too young. Logically speaking, that shouldn’t be the case. This ancestor should know how powerful the progenitor is better than me.”
