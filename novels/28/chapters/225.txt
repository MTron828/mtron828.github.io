Chapter 226 Change in the Mortal World, Heartless Great Dao

“With your cultivation level, aren’t you courting death by going to the Heaven Punishment Divine Region?” The Divine General teased.

Murong Qi rolled his eyes and snorted. “It’s settled, then!”

The Divine General shook his head and laughed, not refuting.

Murong Qi’s thoughts drifted out of the Heavenly Court and back to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain. After getting used to cultivating diligently, he was really not used to life in the Heavenly Court.

After killing Great Sage Heavenly Fox and Dream Demoness, twenty years had passed.

The Scarlet Cloud World had completely changed.

Many Loose Immortals appeared in the cultivation world. Mahayana was no longer a legend!

Under the influence of the Spirit Qi of the Cultivation Immortal Mountain, the cultivation of all the cultivators in the Jade Pure Sacred Sect also increased steadily. Not long ago, they had attracted a Mahayana Realm guest.

Although Han Jue had fewer connections with the Jade Pure Sacred Sect now, no one in the cultivation world dared to provoke them.

The Heavenly Immortal Manor had even established a friendly relationship with them to help each other.

However, there were still disciples kneeling below the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.

Although the chance of being chosen by Han Jue was very low, many people wanted to try.

On this day.

Han Jue had just finished cursing the enemy when he came to the Nine Heavens Galaxy Water to watch.

Li Yao was still traveling through the void. The worlds were endless, and it was very difficult to find the Scarlet Cloud World.

Han Jue had established a connection with her and could let her sense the direction. As for the exact location, she would only know after she got close.

Han Jue deduced.

She was very far away.

It was so far that even the Reincarnation Golden Immortal couldn’t tell how far it was.

After so many years, Li Yao’s cultivation level had been increasing. Now, she was already at the late-stage Grand Unity Heaven Immortal Realm.

Not bad.

Han Jue was very satisfied with Li Yao’s talent. If she could join the Hidden Sect, it would also help increase the average combat strength of the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.

Dao Comprehension Sword asked, “Master, when are you accepting new disciples?”

She had always wanted to take in a female disciple.

Han Jue said, “It’s not time yet.”

He had yet to encounter anyone with Connate providence.

It was indeed strange.

Now that the system’s detection range had already covered the entire Scarlet Cloud World, why was there none in the mortal world?

Could it be that as he grew stronger, the requirements of detecting Connate providence also began to increase?

Very likely.

Someone with Yang Tiandong’s amount of Connate providence wasn’t worth mentioning now.

If it was like before, Han Jue would probably be frequently reminded.

Thinking of Yang Tiandong, he wondered how this kid was doing recently.

“Ever since Fang Liang and Murong Qi ascended, the Fusang Tree has become much quieter. Hao’er is no longer as lively as before.” Dao Comprehension Sword sighed.

Tu Ling’er also often went out to train, so Dao Comprehension Sword’s usual joy was to watch Li Yao’s adventures.

However, Li Yao spent most of her time cultivating or traveling. There were too few exciting segments. Han Jue said calmly, “This is the loneliness on the path of cultivation. If you can’t suppress your loneliness, how can you surpass all living beings?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Dao Comprehension Sword curled her lips and said, “I don’t want to surpass all living beings. Just follow Master.”

“You don’t want to, but I want to. But if your cultivation isn’t enough, you won’t be able to keep up with me and can’t escape the cycle of reincarnation, just like the previous Sect Master of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.”

Han Jue’s words caused Dao Comprehension Sword to frown.

That was true.

For some reason, Dao Comprehension Sword heard a hint of loneliness in Han Jue’s tone.

Thinking about it carefully, she actually didn’t understand him.

She didn’t know where Han Jue came from, what he was thinking, or why he was so obsessed with longevity.

Han Jue was indeed in a low mood. Recently, there seemed to be fewer images in his interpersonal relationships. He couldn’t even remember who they were.

There were not many people in the Jade Pure Sacred Sect that he was familiar with.

Other than Fairy Xi Xuan and Chang Yue’er, everything on Jade Serene Peak had changed.

Even though Fairy Xi Xuan and Chang Yue’er were still alive, Han Jue discovered that his feelings for them were also fading.

Han Jue’s only obsession was longevity.

“Perhaps this is the heartlessness of the Great Dao?” Han Jue thought silently.

No mighty figure could make every related person rise up alongside him.

Experiencing life and death was normal in the mortal world.

After thinking, Han Jue shook his head and smiled. He turned around and returned to the bed to cultivate.

Dao Comprehension Sword fell silent. She sat back on the mat and began cultivating.

She felt something, but it was indescribable.

She knew that only by cultivating persistently could she understand her master’s heart.

Seven years later.

The first thing Xing Hongxuan did when she returned was to find Han Jue.

After Dao Comprehension Sword walked out of the cave abode, she began to talk about her experiences over the years.

Han Jue stared at her in a daze.

Even after so many years, Xing Hongxuan seemed to have not changed.

Perhaps she had changed, but her attitude towards him had not.

As he listened, Han Jue couldn’t help but smile.

Several hours later, Xing Hongxuan finally finished. Her mouth had also gone dry.

She smiled and said, “I really want to ascend as soon as possible. You no longer care about the treasures in the mortal world. Unfortunately, my cultivation level is insufficient. I still have to wait for a few thousand years before I can ascend.”

Han Jue smiled and said, “I don’t need you to give me treasures every time.”

In the past, he needed them and even looked forward to receiving her gifts. Thinking about it now, Han Jue also felt that he was a little ridiculous.

Xing Hongxuan came to find him with joy, but he was thinking about treasures instead.

“Have you had any problems with your cultivation recently?” Han Jue asked.

For some reason, Xing Hongxuan felt that Han Jue was exceptionally gentle today.

He had never been so gentle.

Xing Hongxuan’s smile became even brighter. She started to pull Han Jue’s clothes and smiled. “Yes, but there’s no hurry. Let’s go first…”

“You…”

“Don’t talk, hurry up and…”

After several months, Han Jue began to guide Xing Hongxuan in cultivation and even taught her a Mystical Power.

Two years passed in a flash.

Xing Hongxuan left in satisfaction.

Dao Comprehension Sword looked at her back with a displeased expression. She walked into the Connate Cave Abode and was about to ask, but seeing that Han Jue had already entered a meditative state, she could only give up.

In a bright hall, Su Qi and hundreds of people in similar robes knelt on the ground.

Su Qi was very nervous.

The Divine Palace was a top-notch power in the Immortal World. It was on par with the Heavenly Court. He cherished the opportunity to enter it.

A figure suddenly appeared in front of all the disciples.

This person was dressed in a black robe and had a cold expression, with a sword at his waist.

He was the Sword God Emperor.

Sword God Emperor scanned everyone in the hall, and his gaze suddenly stopped on Su Qi.

He frowned and pinched his fingers to deduce.

“What?

“Such overpowering bad luck. Where did this kid come from? He actually has a master-disciple relationship with that kid…”.

Sword God Emperor thought doubtfully.

Su Qi’s bad luck made him instinctively want to expel him. However, he was related to Han Jue. He thought for a moment and decided to turn a blind eye.

“Although you have passed the palace assessment, you’re still far from being able to gain a foothold in the Divine Palace. If you cannot become a True Immortal within a thousand years, all of you will have to leave,” Sword God Emperor said coldly.

The disciples nodded in agreement. They weren’t afraid. Instead, they were confident.

Those who could enter the Divine Palace were all talented people. Some were even the number one in a mortal world.

Sword God Emperor was about to leave when he suddenly sensed something. His expression instantly darkened as he cursed softly. “Is there an end to this? How unlucky!”

He immediately vanished.
