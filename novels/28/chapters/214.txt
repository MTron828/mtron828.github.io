Chapter 216 Awakening of the War God, Nine-Tailed Demon Empress

Han Jue quickly came to Murong Qi and squatted down. He first used his divine sense to check his body.

He wasn’t injured.

There was a problem with his essence soul!

He probed Murong Qi’s mind with his divine sense, and soon, he saw a shocking scene. Blood rained down as the world darkened. Dozens of terrifying figures fought in the sky. The terrifying aura caused the ground to collapse continuously. Countless bolts of lightning connected the sky and the ground as if the chaos had just begun. It was terrifying.

Han Jue saw a figure emitting divine light with the strongest aura.

He held two halberds of light in his hand and stepped on the fire of the earth. His body was surrounded by lightning, and there was a huge cauldron above his head. It absorbed the Spirit Qi in the surroundings and formed a world-destroying wind.

War God!

The moment Han Jue saw him, he thought of this title.

No matter how many enemies surrounded him, he remained still and suppressed them.

“With my command, the Heavenly Dao will listen and slay the enemy!”

A domineering voice sounded, shocking as if it came from the ancient gods at the beginning of the flood of history.

In an instant, countless bolts of lightning struck down, illuminating the world. It shook until Han Jue’s divine sense was severed and his consciousness returned to reality.

Han Jue frowned and fell into deep thought.

“Master, how is he?” Tu Ling’er asked. The others also looked at Han Jue nervously.

Even Long Hao was very nervous. He liked Murong Qi a lot. Ever since Fang Liang left, their relationship had improved by leaps and bounds. Although there was a difference in seniority, they felt like brothers.

Xun Chang’an suddenly said, “He might have awakened his memories from his previous life and is fusing with them.”

This feeling was too familiar to him!

However, he wasn’t as miserable as Murong Qi when he awakened.

“Oh? Murong Qi has a previous life?” the Three-Headed Wyrm King asked in surprise.

The Black Hell Chicken cried out, “No wonder! I’ve always felt that this kid’s talent is ridiculous! No matter how I chase him, I can’t catch up!”

So, Murong Qi also had a powerful background.

Han Jue said, “He’s fine for the time being. Let’s wait for him to recover.”

The others began to discuss, curious about Murong Qi’s identity in his previous life.

There were many legends of reincarnations of immortals in the mortal world.

Han Jue didn’t return to his cave abode. He sat in front of Murong Qi and waited patiently.

Four days passed before Murong Qi recovered. When he opened his eyes, the first person he saw was Han Jue.

With a complicated expression, he slowly said, “Grandmaster…”

Han Jue said, “No matter what, this will always be your home. Here, you don’t have to worry about anything. Just say whatever you want. You don’t have to worry about whether I can accept it or not. Actually, I know everything about you.”

Murong Qi’s pupils constricted as his emotions became even more complicated.

Han Jue teased, “Do you know where your master came from? He’s an Ancient Spiritual Ginseng from the Buddhist Sect. He was once cursed by the gods and Buddhas and went through a love tribulation in the cycle of reincarnation. He suffered terribly.” These words attracted the attention of the others.

Xun Chang’an had such an identity?

No wonder he was so obsessed with Qian’er.

Xun Chang’an’s expression was calm and indifferent.

The Black Hell Chicken was pleasantly surprised. “Looks like I’m really a phoenix! Master didn’t lie to me!”

Since Murong Qi and Xun Chang’an both had powerful backgrounds, so did it!

The others couldn’t help but let their imagination run wild.

Who didn’t want to have a prominent identity in their previous life?

Murong Qi said, “Grandmaster, since you know, why did you still accept me?”

He was no longer in high spirits. He looked very down and out.

“Didn’t you kneel for so many years to become my disciple?” Han Jue asked with a smile.

Murong Qi was stunned before he smiled bitterly. “I implicated Grandmaster.”

Han Jue snorted. “Don’t you understand what I said just now? If you acknowledge me as your Grandmaster, I’ll protect you. Even if it’s the Divine Palace, I won’t be afraid. Just stay on the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain and cultivate well. When you have the capital to take revenge, you’ll kill your way back.”

“But…”

“But what? Do you think I’m an ant in front of the Divine Palace?”

“I…”

“Cultivate in peace. If the Divine Palace had discovered you, they would have come long

ago.”

Murong Qi was silent.

Han Jue said meaningfully, “You might have been very powerful in your previous life, but here, your previous life’s identity is not considered outstanding. Some people are more ridiculous than you.”

Murong Qi was shocked and looked at the others.

The others looked at each other.

The Black Hell Chicken said smugly, “Of course. I’m a phoenix. Do you know the origins of a phoenix?”

Long Hao said proudly, “Disciple-Nephew, what are you afraid of? Is the Divine Palace very strong? I’m the son of the Heavenly Emperor! Wait for me to take… In any case, I’ll avenge you in the future!”

Murong Qi smiled and said proudly, “I’m not afraid of the Divine Palace. I’m just afraid of implicating you guys. There’s no need for you to do anything. In the future, I’ll challenge the Divine Palace alone and let all their Immortal Emperors perish!”

Han Jue sized him up carefully and felt that he didn’t change much.

He hadn’t completely transformed into a stranger. Perhaps Murong Qi had only obtained his memories, and his personality was still the same. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Master, what’s your relationship with the Heavenly Court?” Murong Qi suddenly asked. Han Jue said, “You can go to the Heavenly Court if you want in the future. I can help you.”

Murong Qi understood what he meant. Then, Han Jue stood up and returned to the Connate Cave Abode.

Everyone surrounded Murong Qi and asked about his past.

Murong Qi didn’t reveal anything, just as Xun Chang’an wouldn’t mention his previous life.

Dao Comprehension Sword followed Han Jue into the cave abode and asked curiously, “Master, what’s his identity? Tell me. I definitely won’t tell anyone.”

Han Jue sat on the bed and told her what he knew about Murong Qi.

Dao Comprehension Sword was dumbfounded.

She didn’t expect Murong Qi to have such a high status.

It was too terrifying!

Han Jue said seriously, “This matter cannot be revealed, including the other disciples of the Hidden Sect.”

Dao Comprehension Sword nodded heavily. She also knew that this was not a joke.

(The Nine-tailed Demon Empress has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]

A line of words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue. He couldn’t help but frown and immediately checked his interpersonal relationships.

(Nine-tailed Demon Empress: Late-stage Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm, one of the Demon Empresses of the Demon Court, the mother of Crown Prince Tianze. When she learned that you killed him, she developed hatred towards you. She won’t rest until you’re dead. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]

Han Jue frowned even more. This still happened, after all.

He immediately took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the Nine-tailed Demon Empress.

After cursing for five days, he continued cursing the other enemies.

You guys, if you want to blame someone, blame the Nine-tailed Demon Empress! Han Jue thought silently.

Several months later, before he finished cursing, Di Taibai’s divine sense fluctuation came from the Heavenly Dao Token.

Han Jue established a connection with him.

“Don’t leave the territory under the Heavenly Court in the future.” Di Taibai’s tone was solemn.

Han Jue responded positively.

You must be joking.

I’ve no intention of going out, anyway.

Di Taibai asked, “Aren’t you curious about why I said this?”

“Need you ask? It must be because of Crown Prince Tianze,” Han Jue said helplessly. He felt that Di Taibai was too busy recently.

Di Taibai sighed. “That’s not the case. Something even more terrifying has happened.”
