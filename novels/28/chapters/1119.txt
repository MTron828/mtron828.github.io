Chapter 1122 Last Hope

Han Huang, Primordial Origin, Huang Zuntian, Zhao Shuangquan, the Ultimate God of Punishment, the Primordial Ancestor God, the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit, Emperor, Han Ye, Formless World, and so on.

The top mighty figures of the Chaos were all silent. They didn’t give the order to attack, much less boost morale.

Despair and fear spread throughout the Chaos.

Han Jue was disappointed and pretended to be disdainful. “Are you really giving up? I originally thought that the Chaos would fight until the end. Even if you die, you will die in battle. Do you know what the Ninth Chaos who created the Chaos said before he died? Can you

“He begged me to let you all go. imagine a transcendent existence standing at the end of cultivation, controlling space and time, controlling fate, and controlling

creation begging me like a mortal?”

The Dark Forbidden Lord’s words made all the

mighty figures furious.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Han Huang looked up, his eyes filled with killing intent.

Even Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian were the same. They almost went berserk.

No matter how they fought, they could not change a fact. All the mighty figures present were born in the Chaos and owed it a favor. Even the transcendent existence who created the Chaos fought until the end and died in battle. What were they afraid of?

Even the living beings watching the battle through the dream were infuriated, wishing they could tear the Dark Forbidden Lord into pieces.

Primordial Despair roared as if congratulating the Dark Forbidden Lord on his victory.

Boom-

Han Huang transformed into a Primordial Fiendcelestial and attacked Han Jue. He held the Divine Punishment Light Blade in his hand and wanted to cut him off, but it was easily crushed.

Han Jue was satisfied with Han Huang’s performance.

Only by daring to resist in a desperate situation could he be considered his son.

If Han Huang gave up directly, Han Jue would choose someone else to accept this Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.

“Hidden Sect disciples, listen up. Kill!” Li Yao raised her sword and shouted softly. All the Hidden Sect disciples immediately attacked Han Jue.

Although the Chaotic Heavenly Dog was afraid, it still attacked when it was time.

Dozens of personal disciples attacked together. The Chaotic Fiendcelestials used

their Great Dao Mystical Powers with a huge commotion. In a desperate situation, the Hidden Sect disciples erupted with stronger strength than before.

Han Jue waved his hand and destroyed them all. However, their souls were not injured. These disciples quickly recovered their bodies. “Creation Emperor Court, fight to the death!”

Han Ling flew towards the Primordial Despair. Her solemn and magnificent voice also made the entire Creation Emperor Court

attack.

It was the same for the other major factions.

Han Jue was satisfied.

His Hidden Sect was at least not cowardly.

True courage was to face death and the

destined outcome.

From the point of view of the Chaos, when the Ninth Chaos died, there was no hope.

Perhaps the disciples of the Hidden Sect were still looking forward to Han Jue’s appearance, but the Chaotic mighty figures were really

hopeless.

Han Jue suddenly felt that the Chaos was not meaningless.

Perhaps he could change the situation.

Chaos was born, the Primordial Chaos was

destroyed, endless life was born, and the Chaos was destroyed. When would this cycle

end?

Han Jue suddenly became larger than the

entire Chaos. With a wave of his right hand, more than ten thousand Great Dao Sages were

reduced to ashes and countless worlds

shattered.

However, the Great Dao Sages quickly recovered their bodies. They also discovered

this. Why didn’t the Dark Forbidden Lord kill

them?

Primordial Despair opened his mouth and

rolled his tongue. Only then did the Great Dao Sages understand.

The Dark Forbidden Lord really thought they were Primordial Despair’s prey!

“That’s right. I like to watch the dying spirit

struggle!”

Han Jue smiled impudently and deliberately exaggerated the atmosphere of despair, giving the Chaotic mighty figures more pressure.

Then, he bent down and looked down at the

entire Chaos. His dark face revealed a pair of scarlet eyes and a mouth filled with fangs, turning into the greatest fear in the hearts of

all living beings.

“Struggle with all your might! Fear to your heart’s content!”

The Dark Forbidden Lord’s wild laughter echoed in the Chaos like thunder.

Mighty figures attacked him one after another. Their bodies were constantly destroyed and they were constantly reborn.

They continued to kill.

They ignored the Primordial Despair, but it

did not stop. It continued to devour living beings and the world.

At this moment, the mighty figures fighting to the death had already forgotten their fear. They only wanted to kill the Dark Forbidden

Lord. Han Jue waved his palms and killed them

again and again. He pretended to enjoy it and laughed extremely arrogantly.

He noticed that the dim Seven Supreme Rules

at the top of the Chaos had lit up again and were still fusing.

The power of faith of all living beings was

fusing into the Supreme Rules in a way that his senses could not spy on. Even a Dao Creator could not sense this detail. He could

only see the Supreme Rules light up. “Interesting.”

Han Jue secretly thought that if there was

really a Dark Forbidden Lord whose cultivation was inferior to the Creator Lord, he might really fail.

Now that he thought about it, the Ninth Chaos’ last words were not lies.

Han Jue ignored the Supreme Rules of the Chaos and continued to wreak havoc.

At the same time, the Third Dao Field. Xing Hongxuan, Xuan Qingjun, and the other Dao Companions came to Han Jue’s Daoist temple. The other disciples also knelt in front of the Daoist temple.

They could also see the dream of the Dark Forbidden Lord and knew what situation the Chaos was facing.

Han Jue let them in.

Qingluan’er was the first to speak, “Husband, can you move them all back?”

The other women also looked at him

anxiously.

They didn’t dare to expect Han Jue to go out

and fight. After all, they had already witnessed the Dark Forbidden Lord’s power. He was really invincible.

Xing Hongxuan didn’t say anything but looked at him. Didn’t you call yourself invincible?

His children would all die if he did not move

now! Han Jue said helplessly, “I can’t move them back. The Dark Forbidden Lord has already isolated the Chaos to prevent anyone from escaping.”

The women were silent.

Dao Comprehension Sword muttered, “Sister Li Yao is still outside…”

Chang Yue’er looked at him and hesitated.

Han Jue sighed and slowly stood up. “Forget

it.”

He started stretching. “Husband, are you…” Xuan Qingjun asked

excitedly. If Han Jue was willing to help, he must be confident!

Xing Hongxuan finally smiled. That was more like it.

Han Jue said, “I’m indeed not completely confident, but for my children, for Li Yao, and

for my disciples, I have no choice but to help.

Watch.”

Qingluan’er could not help but say, “If there’s really no other way… why don’t…”

She wanted to say ‘Forget it’, but it was too difficult. Her son was also outside. Han Jue said, “If I can’t win, I can also revive

in the Dao Field. Alright, go back and wait.”

With that, all the Supreme Treasures on Han Jue’s body burst out. Divine light flickered and covered his figure.

Han Huang revived again. He clenched his

fists and felt his Dharmic powers dissipate. He was filled with unwillingness. Was there really no other way? At this moment, Han Ling appeared beside

him and said, “Second Brother, I have an

idea.”

She sent a voice transmission to him. Han Huang immediately rejected it. “Impossible! I can’t accept it!”

Han Ling sighed. “Only this method can have

a chance now. As long as we can protect the Chaos, there will be a chance of survival, no matter how great the sacrifice.”
