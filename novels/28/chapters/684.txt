Chapter 687 Breakthrough! Perfection!

“Then, how do you know that it’s not a scheme of the Buddhist Sect to give you an opportunity and guide you to become the Buddha again?” Han Jue asked. Chu Shiren’s words couldn’t convince him. Chu Shiren said, “I relied on that opportunity to become stronger. After that, I joined the Buddhist Sect by chance. I didn’t join the Buddhist Sect after obtaining that opportunity.”

Han Jue remained silent.

Chu Shiren said seriously, “Grandmaster, I’ll become a Pseudo-Sage soon. Let me out. You’ve raised us for so long. Are you just raising us? You definitely need our help. When I become a Sage in the Chaos, I’ll definitely return to lead the Hidden Sect to prosperity. You’re right. If you want there to be no suffering in the world, it’s not as simple as abolishing cultivation. You have to be absolutely powerful and suppress all

greed!

“I’m willing to follow Grandmaster and reach the strongest position, creating a truly peaceful and beautiful world!” Such morals and values were amazing.

Han Jue was speechless. Why are you piling responsibilities on me?

He said, “In that case, go ahead. I’m just worried that the Chaos is too dangerous. In the future, all the disciples will go to the Chaos. If you die, I can’t save you one by one.”

Chu Shiren was touched and said seriously, “Don’t worry, Grandmaster. I definitely won’t burden you. Besides, I don’t show my treasures and don’t fight with others. I usually won’t encounter danger. Even if I do, I can rely on myself.” With that, Han Jue had nothing to say. He asked Chu Shiren to go and prepare. Fortunately, there was no prerequisite for the personal disciple to leave with Chu Shiren.

That day, Han Jue sent Chu Shiren out.

He looked at the Immortal World and the emails before entering cultivation again.

2,731 years later.

Han Jue finally broke through!

[Name: Han Jue)

[Lifespan: 234,841 / 9,407,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999]

‘[Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial ]

(Immeasurable Emperor)]

[Cultivation: Perfected Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm (Perfect Sage)]

[Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]

‘[Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]

Looking at his long lifespan, Han Jue was in a good mood. When he broke through to the Great Dao Sage Realm, his lifespan would definitely increase by two digits. Just thinking about it ‘made him feel ecstatic. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Han Jue continued to consolidate his cultivation. It took fifty years for his cultivation to completely stabilize.

Han Jue didn’t improve his Mystical Powers but checked his emails.

[Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by your enemy, Jade Bodhi. He was severely injured.)

[Your son Han Tuo was suppressed by your enemy, Jade Bodhi. His will was forcefully erased.]

[Your disciple Zhou Fan has fused with the Great Dao Tower. His body has transformed into a Great Dao Body. His providence has increased greatly.]

(Your good friend Pan Xin was cursed by a ‘mysterious curse.] ‘

[Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren has obtained a Chaotic Relic. His cultivation has increased greatly.]

[Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by your enemy, the Curse Fiendcelestial.)

[Your good friend Empress Houtu has revived the twelve Ancestral Magi. The providence of the Magus Race has increased greatly.)

Jade Bodhi!

Great!

You’re next!

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing. It wasn’t easy for him to break through. Killing an enemy to liven things up was also a good thing. He wasn’t afraid of exposing his identity. If the other Great Dao Sages guessed it, it would be a good chance to intimidate them and make them stop attacking the people around him.

Five days later. Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease rapidly. On the other side. In a bright hall, majestic Buddha statues stood tall. On a round platform sat two old Daoists.

It was Jade Bodhi and Jie Yin.

Jie Yin frowned and asked, “He’s still cursing?” Jade Bodhi gritted his teeth. “That’s right. The curse power suddenly strengthened.” Jie Yin sighed. “You insist on plotting against the Heavenly Court. Why don’t you think about it? If the Heavenly Court doesn’t have a backer, can the Evil Heavenly Emperor rise? Do you really think the previous Karma Heaven has nothing to do with the Heavenly Court? “The Dark Forbidden Lord is very likely the existence behind Han Jue. Han Jue cares about the Evil Heavenly Emperor. You captured Han Jue’s son among the immortals. How can he not hate you?”

Jade Bodhi’s expression darkened. “How would I know that Han Jue has such great influence on the Dark Forbidden Lord?”

Back then, when he first knew Han Jue, this fellow was like an ant. How many years had it been?

Another strong curse attacked, almost drowning the Jade Bodhi’s will.

Jie Yin also felt it, and his expression changed. Damn it!

Why was he so strong?

It was much stronger than the last time he cursed Cundi!

Could it be that the Dark Forbidden Lord was also becoming stronger, or had he found more sacrificial creatures?

Jade Bodhi asked in a low voice, “What should we do? I feel like we can’t take it anymore!” Jie Yin said, “Just go ahead and die. I’ll protect your essence soul. I’ll revive you and Cundi when the Great Dao Calamity descends!”

Jade Bodhi was unwilling.

He never expected things to suddenly develop to this extent. “Alright!”

Jade Bodhi agreed readily and directly perished, leaving only a wisp of his remnant soul to guide him.

(Because of your curse, your enemy Jade Bodhi died and only a remnant soul is left.] When Han Jue saw this email, the curse missed its target. So fast?

I only used less than ten billion years of my lifespan! Han Jue had an inexplicable illusion that he had become much stronger.

But on second thought, the other party must be experienced in this.

But why couldn’t he continue cursing when only a remnant soul was left? Could it be that the other party had used some secret technique? Or perhaps this was the Great Dao Sage. He was still alive and would never die. Then, how was Undying Dao killed by Ancestor Xitian?

No matter what, it was impossible for Jade Bodhi to cause trouble again in the short term.

Han Jue stopped thinking and began to comprehend the Mystical Powers. On the other side.

In a mysterious palace. Han Tuo and Yi Tian were imprisoned. There were hundreds of immortals around them.

Yi Tian teased, “Brother, let’s make a bet. Will Jade Bodhi die an unnatural death this time?”

Han Tuo rolled his eyes. “Do you really think we’re so lucky every time?” Yi Tian shook his head. “How is it good luck? In my opinion, there’s a supernatural

existence protecting us. Even a Great Dao | Sage is not his match. You can guess who it is.”

Hearing this, Han Tuo instantly thought of his father.

However, he was not sure.

Was his father really that strong? The last time he visited, his father had even reminded him repeatedly that he could only rely on himself, so he had to be careful.

Such actions did not seem like those powerful existences who loved their children.

Han Tuo smiled helplessly. What was he thinking?

He really believed Yi Tian’s nonsense. They were still prisoners. It was unknown if they could survive. At this moment, a powerful aura attacked from the darkness outside the cage, stirring up a violent wind.

The immortals stood up in fear. A figure appeared in front of the cage and waved his hand to destroy the restrictions. It was the Evil Heavenly Emperor! “Your Majesty!” The immortals were pleasantly surprised. Han Tuo had a strange expression. Yi Tian patted his shoulder and smiled. “See? I guessed correctly. I just don’t know who that amazing person is.”
