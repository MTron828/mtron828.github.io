Chapter 46: Dao Companion, Mystical Power Somersault Cloud

Because of the pressure brought by the Raincoat Sect, Han Jue cultivated even harder.

The Black Hell Chicken could only suffer in silence.

As Han Jue tried his best to absorb Qi, the Spirit Qi in the cave abode surged into his body. The speed at which the Black Hell Chicken drew in Spirit Qi was suppressed.

Seven years later.

Han Jue finally broke through to the eighth level of the Nascent Soul realm!

He still felt that time was tight. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

If he could break through to the Soul Formation realm before the Raincoat Sect attacked, he would be even more confident.

Han Jue absorbed Qi while checking his interpersonal relationships.

[Your friend Zhou Fan was attacked by the Raincoat Sect] x87

[Your disciple Yang Tiandong was attacked by the Raincoat Sect] x87

[Your good friend Mo Zhu was attacked by a fellow disciple.]

[Your good friend Li Qingzi was attacked by a fellow sect member and was severely injured.]

...

Eh?

Why was Li Qingzi attacked by a fellow sect member?

Han Jue was stunned.

Was there another spy?

He immediately checked the Jade Pure Sect.

Nascent Soul realm cultivators were not spies.

Wait.

Could it be Guan Yougang?

Han Jue was right. It was Guan Yougang.

Guan Yougang didn’t dare to challenge the Deity Slaying Elder, so he gave up on becoming the Sect Master. However, he couldn’t take it lying down, so he looked for Li Qingzi to spar and took the opportunity to vent.

The elders of the sect were extremely displeased with him due to this.

The Jade Pure Sect was in danger now, but he was still causing trouble. Did he still want to be the Sect Master in such circumstances?

After Guan Yougang was scolded, he went into seclusion in anger and no longer showed himself.

However, he didn’t leave the sect. He obviously had the Jade Pure Sect in his heart.

Han Jue didn’t know any of this. He continued to read the emails.

Fairy Xi Xuan, Chang Yue’er, and Xing Hongxuan were all fine. The other good friends were more or less fighting with others, including Xuan Qingjun.

Xuan Qingjun’s cultivation was still at the third level of the Foundation Establishment realm. Han Jue suspected that she didn’t cultivate at all and only observed others.

When Han Jue was thinking to himself, he suddenly sensed a presence.

Xuan Qingjun!

This woman was here again!

“Is Fellow Daoist here? Can I pay you a visit?”

Hearing Xuan Qingjun’s voice, Han Jue became nervous.

He thought about it. The other party definitely knew that he was here. If he pretended to be out, the favorability might be gone.

The other party was the Demon Lord. Her favorability was definitely better than hatred!

After thinking, Han Jue opened the cave abode’s stone door.

Xuan Qingjun walked over.

She couldn’t help but smile when she saw him.

Han Jue was helpless.

The Black Hell Chicken still remembered Xuan Qingjun’s aura.

It screamed in terror: “Please! Don’t eat my master!”

Xuan Qingjun was confused.

Han Jue felt a little awkward.

He glared at the Black Hell Chicken, who dared not speak again.

She walked in front of Han Jue and said with a smile, “I’m a disciple of Jade Bamboo Peak, Xuan Qingjun. I met you in the inner sect a few years ago and was shocked. From then on, your figure was buried in my heart. I came to visit you rashly this time. I hope that you won’t blame me.”

How direct!

Han Jue felt awkward and didn’t know how to reply.

“Senior’s handsomeness is truly rare in this world, you’re simply unparalleled. Junior is willing to offer a treasure. I hope that Senior Brother won’t reject me.”

Xuan Qingjun smiled. With a flip of her hand, a jade piece appeared.

Han Jue asked curiously, “What is this?”

“This is the Heavenly Immortal Abode token. The Heavenly Immortal Abode is the cultivation holy land of the cultivation world. Only by obtaining the Heavenly Immortal Abode token can one cultivate there. Once there, one can reach the Nascent Soul realm at the very least.”

Xuan Qingjun smiled and explained.

She snorted in her heart. I don’t believe you won’t be tempted.

Brat, I want you simply due to your good looks!

Han Jue shook his head and said, “Thank you for your kind intentions, junior. It’s just that I don’t want to leave the Jade Pure Sect. I plan to cultivate in the sect forever.”

Xuan Qingjun froze on the spot.

She changed treasures again and said, “This is the Earth Spirit Sword. It can easily kill Golden Core Realm experts.”

“Uh...”

“Not enough? I’ll give you another bottle of pills to break through to the Golden Core realm!”

“Errrmmm...”

“I’ll give you another Body Tempering cultivation technique! I’ll add three more spell techniques!”

Damn...

She was really rich!

If it was a hundred years ago, Han Jue definitely wouldn’t have been able to resist. He really didn’t want to work hard anymore.

Han Jue hesitated for a moment and said, “Actually, I’m already at the Nascent Soul realm.”

He no longer hid his cultivation level. He revealed his eighth-level Nascent Soul realm cultivation level and then hid it again.

Xuan Qingjun was shocked.

She instantly guessed the truth and asked, “You... are the Deity Slaying Elder?”

Han Jue nodded.

The other party was the Demon Lord. Since she had targeted him, she would definitely not let this matter rest.

Xuan Qingjun was even more delighted. She had not expected that her judgment would be so good that she would directly capture the most mysterious and powerful Deity Slaying Elder of the Jade Pure Sect.

[Xuan Qingjun’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 4 stars]

She took out another bottle of pills from her sleeve and said, “This is a first-grade Nascent Soul Pill. It can help you increase your cultivation speed.

“Is one bottle enough? If not, I’ll give you another!”

As she spoke, she took out another bottle of Nascent Soul Pills.

This time, Han Jue really couldn’t take it anymore.

He carefully asked, “Junior, what’s your background?”

Xuan Qingjun finally realized that she had been exposed.

But it didn’t matter now.

“My identity isn’t important. I want to become Dao companions with you. I wonder if Senior Brother is willing?” Xuan Qingjun asked with a smile.

Han Jue frowned and asked, “Since you can take out so many treasures, you must be extraordinary. Can you help us deal with the Raincoat Sect?”

If the Demon Lord took action, then it would be safe!

Xuan Qingjun shook her head. “No, I only care about you and not the Jade Pure Sect. Could it be that you cultivate for the sect?”

Han Jue remained silent.

Indeed.

It was not so easy to command the Demon Lord.

But these two bottles of Nascent Soul Pills were very fragrant. It was very difficult for him to reject them.

“If I promise you, what price will I pay?” Han Jue asked cautiously.

Xuan Qingjun covered her mouth and laughed. “I won’t eat you. We’ll cultivate together. You’ll only become stronger! That’s great news for you!”

[Xuan Qingjun wants to become your Dao Companion. You have the following choices:]

[1: Reject. How can we male cultivators be threatened by a woman? You will obtain the Demon Lord’s hatred and a Sword Dao Mystical Power inheritance.]

[2: Accept. The two of you will become Dao companions. You will be affected by karma and providence. You will be able to obtain the favor of the Demon Lord and obtain a Mystical Power inheritance.]

What would happen if he rejected Xuan Qingjun?

Would the Demon Lord show up?

That was a big shot who was about to ascend!

Han Jue sighed in his heart and said, “In that case, I will become Dao companions with you.”

[You have successfully become Xuan Qingjun’s Dao companion. You have obtained a Mystical Power inheritance.]

[Congratulations on obtaining Mystical Power—Somersault Cloud]

[Somersault Cloud: Movement Mystical Power. One somersault can travel a hundred thousand miles.]

[Xuan Qingjun’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 4.5 stars]

Somersault Cloud?

Amazing!

Han Jue’s eyes lit up.

This was a godly escape technique!

Haha, if the Demon Lord acted recklessly at this time, he would immediately do a somersault and escape for a hundred thousand miles.

Xuan Qingjun smiled and put down the two bottles of Nascent Soul Pills in her hand. “From now on, you’re my cultivation partner. Cultivate well. I’ll come to you when I need you.”

With that, she turned and left.

Han Jue couldn’t help but ask, “Other than me, do you have any other Dao Companion?”

Xuan Qingjun paused and snorted. “How can that be! I don’t like mortals. If not for the fact that I needed a companion and that you were extremely handsome, I wouldn’t have chosen you!”

She quickly left.

Han Li looked at the two bottles of Nascent Soul Pills beside his bed in despair and remained silent for a long time.

The Black Hell Chicken asked timidly, “Master, will she still eat you?”
