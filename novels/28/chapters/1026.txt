Chapter 1029 Mystical Destiny Book, Book of Misfortune

Qin Bashen was extremely excited upon hearing that his mother could reincarnate.

Han Ling continued, “Your surname will be Han from today onwards.”

Qin Bashen nodded. “Alright. I hate the Qin surname, anyway!”

At this point, he changed his name to Han Bashen and cultivated under Han Ling.

To Han Jue, this was a small matter. In the future, the chosen ones could also do this. He didn’t have to nurture them personally.

Of course, he still had to do it himself if the creation was extremely abnormal.

Han Jue was not disappointed. Han Bashen focused on cultivating and rarely went out after coming to the Dao Field.

In the blink of an eye.

After millions of years, Han Jue’s age increased again.

[Detected that you are 60 million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]

[1: Exit seclusion immediately and open the Ultimate Origin World in the Chaos. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.]

[2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.]

The two choices were the same. There was no difference. Han Jue would treat it as a fixed gift from the system.

He silently chose the second option.

(You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.]

Han Jue looked at the neighboring Daoist temple’s Han Bashen. This kid’s cultivation had already reached Freedom after five million years of cultivation.

The Spirit Qi in the Dao Field was richer than anywhere else in the entire Chaos. In Han Jue’s opinion, the progress of Han Bashen’s cultivation was still a little slow.

Han Ling was usually busy cultivating and only taught him a total of three times. It seemed that this was not Han Bashen’s fault. In the past, Han Jue at least had the system to help.

Han Jue opened the emails.

The recent emails were extremely chaotic. There were all sorts of attacks, and even Hidden Sect disciples attacked each other.

Zhou Fan had fought Li Daokong and was severely injured.

Han Tuo and Huang Zuntian had also fought and were both severely injured.

Dao Sovereign and the other three had also recently returned to the Chaos. Han Ye and Han Yao had fought more than once, and each time, both sides were severely injured.

Han Jue had no intention of mediating. These disciples had also graduated. Be it sparring or really fighting, he couldn’t care less.

Han Jue’s gaze landed on the Chaos after reading the emails.

He discovered that the Chaotic Spirit Qi had increased greatly. The Seven Supreme Rules had also increased in size. The three thousand Great Dao had also become heavier.

It was precisely because of this that the various factions in the Chaos fought even more chaotically, thinking that they were creating providence for the Chaos. Even the Ultimate God of Punishment thought so.

Only Han Jue knew that this meant that the Ninth Chaos had become stronger.

The thought of the Ninth Chaos about to become the Creator Lord made Han Jue very nervous.

The Dao Creator was already extremely terrifying. Who knew how unbelievable the Creator Lord was? The Dao Field’s array formation was only at the Creator Lord level. It was unknown if it could completely block the Ninth Chaos after he broke through.

Han Jue suddenly had a bold thought.

Should he curse the Ninth Chaos?

The Book of Misfortune was already an Ultimate Dao Treasure. Who could it not curse?

Han Jue asked in his mind, “Will the Ninth Chaos scheme against me after he becomes a Creator Lord? For example, suppressing me.”

[100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

(Yes]

What the hell!

What a scumbag!

That made sense. The Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity wouldn’t be in such a sorry state if the Ninth Chaos was really so kind.

“Will I be discovered if I use the Book of Misfortune to curse the Ninth Chaos?”

[The Ultimate Dao Treasure is at the Dao Creator level. The Ninth Chaos can’t directly deduce the Book of Misfortune, but it can be inferred.]

Han Jue thought of the Mystical Destiny Book next.

Use the Mystical Destiny Book to change the understanding of all living beings and make them think that the Dark Forbidden Lord indeed existed, so he couldn’t be Han Jue, before cursing the Ninth Chaos?

That’s it!

Perfect!

Han Jue immediately shooed Han Ling out and asked her to teach Han Bashen for a few days. He would preach the Dao to him later. Then, he took out the Mystical Destiny Book and started to use it. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I want all living beings, including the Ninth Chaos, to think that the Dark Forbidden Lord indeed exists. It has nothing to do with me, Han Jue!”

(1 decillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

So much!

However, Han Jue could still accept it compared to half his lifespan.

The first time he used it, his lifespan was not even 1 decillion years. Now, he had 12 octodecillion years of lifespan. The lifespan deducted was basically nothing.

Han Jue chose to continue!

The Mystical Destiny Book emitted a divine light. The aura still made him palpitate.

As expected of an Ultimate Supreme Treasure!

After the divine light disappeared, Han Jue looked at the cooldown time and discovered that it had become a hundred million years.

He would have waited until he was 160 million years old if he wanted to use it again!

Han Jue smiled and kept the Mystical Destiny Book. Then, he changed it to the Book of Misfortune.

It had been a long time since he had cursed someone. He was quite excited.

He preferred cursing existences stronger than him compared to cursing the weak!

Ninth Chaos, are you ready?

You can forget about being the first to become a Creator Lord!

Han Jue began to curse the Ninth Chaos. As an Ultimate Dao Treasure, the Book of Misfortune could already curse all existences!

The power of the curse erupted and black light flashed, causing his face to become ghastly and terrifying. He was no longer as holy as before.

Five days later, Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease rapidly.

He opened his attributes panel and stared at it. As expected of the Ninth Chaos, his lifespan decreased extremely quickly.

A hundred million years!

A billion years!

10 billion years!

100 billion years!

A trillion years!

Han Jue was immersed in the pleasure of the curse and couldn’t extricate himself.

As he cursed, he recalled the past. The enemies he had forgotten kept appearing in his mind.

He really missed them.

In the Daoist temple next door.

Han Bashen felt uneasy. He was very nervous at the thought that Han Jue was about to preach the Dao.

When he first came, although he knew that Han Jue was very strong, he didn’t expect it to far exceed his imagination. Ever since Han Ling explained the realms and Chaos to him, he knew that he had obtained a huge opportunity.

Han Ling noticed his uneasiness and smiled. “Don’t be nervous. My father won’t eat you.”

Terve

Han Bashen asked, “Ancestor, can you tell me about the progenitor’s past?”.

Han Ling smiled and nodded, then told him what she knew.

Han Bashen listened very seriously.

Han Bashen worshiped Han Jue knowing that the primogenitor was also a mortal in the past and had risen step by step from the mortal world to controlling the Chaos.

He suddenly felt that his encounter was nothing. Although his father did not treat him well, he at least raised him. As for his progenitor, he had been abandoned by his parents when he was young and had grown up alone. He had done everything by himself until he created the Han family.

Han Bashen was ashamed thinking of his complaints about the Ancestor when they first met.

He suddenly felt that the progenitor had chosen him not because of his providence, but because he sympathized with him.

Han Ling smiled and said after she finished speaking, “So you have to cultivate well. Don’t let my father down. He gave you your talent before he decided you’d serve me.”
