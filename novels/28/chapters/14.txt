Chapter 15: Defeat the Beasts With the Sword Shadows

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After learning the Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique, Han Jue became much more confident.

He could now produce three sword shadows, each of a different attribute.

And he could manipulate all of them with ease!

The technique could also be activated continuously. When the sword shadows of the first activation disappeared, he could summon another three, until he ran out of spirit energy.

Han Jue’s spirit energy far surpassed cultivators of the same realm. After all, he cultivated the technique inherited from the Immortal Emperor, the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique!

Apart from cultivating six types of spirit energy, each type of spirit energy in the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique could be cultivated to a robust state.

“From today on, I’m no longer a weakling.”

Han Jue thought proudly.

He returned to the pavilion in high spirits and prepared to continue cultivating.

Cultivation was the key.

The higher one’s cultivation level was, the stronger the effects of his techniques!

When he reached the Nascent Soul realm, his Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique would have an apocalyptic effect!

Han Jue was looking forward to it!

...

Several days later.

Jade Serene Peak sent over two more disciples. One was Chang Yue’er, and the other was also his senior, Meng He.

Meng He was the Jade Serene Peak’s seventh disciple. His cultivation level had reached the ninth-stage Foundation Establishment realm. He was pretty strong.

“Why is the forest outside cut off? What happened?” Meng He asked in confusion.

Han Jue replied, “Previously, beasts tried to besiege me. Fortunately, an elder helped.”

Chang Yue’er sized him up and asked, “Junior, are you alright?”

As she spoke, she reached out to touch him.

Han Jue hurriedly took a step back.

Furious, Chang Yue’er scolded him. “Are you serious?”

Han Jue cleared his throat and said, “Master has warned that disciples of Jade Serene Peak are not allowed...”

“Hmph, you wish! I’m just concerned about you!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Meng He shook his head and laughed.

He didn’t find it strange. Although Han Jue kept a low profile, rumors about his good looks had already spread far and wide.

Many female cultivators in the inner sect were talking about a breathtakingly handsome disciple from the Jade Serene Peak, but they didn’t know his name.

After hearing the rumors, Meng He immediately reckoned that they were referring to Han Jue.

Not to mention Jade Serene Peak, even in the entire inner sect, no male disciple was more handsome than Han Jue.

Chang Yue’er was quite pretty, but she was still far from the most beautiful female cultivator.

Junior Han Jue doesn’t need to worry about finding a companion!

“Master was afraid that you would be in danger, so she sent us to help you. It’s said that the Viridescent Nether Cult might have already infiltrated the Ten Thousand Demon Realm. We have to be careful,” Meng He reminded.

Viridescent Nether Cult?

Han Jue frowned.

No wonder that if he had subdued the Tiger Heart White Dragon, he would attract the attention of the Cult.

So, they have already infiltrated the Ten Thousand Demon Realm?

Perhaps that’s why Li Qingzi came here.

How dangerous!

Han Jue suddenly wanted to leave the Ten Thousand Demon Realm.

“Junior Chang, rest first. I’ll go out and take a look.”

After saying this, Meng He walked out of the pavilion.

Han Jue walked to the side and continued to meditate, not giving Chang Yue’er a chance to strike up a conversation.

Chang Yue’er curled her lips and also began to cultivate.

Ever since she found out that Han Jue was already at the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm, she had spent most of her time cultivating in seclusion. She was fired up.

But regarding Han Jue’s cultivation, Fairy Xi Xuan had told her not to spread it out, so the other disciples of the Jade Serene Peak didn’t know of his cultivation level.

Two days later.

Meng He finally returned.

He looked like he had run into trouble.

Han Jue and Chang Yue’er hurriedly stood up to attend to him.

Meng He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said with lingering fear, “I encountered a very strong beast equivalent to a Golden Core cultivator. I nearly died.”

Han Jue asked, “Are there many beasts nearby?”

“There’s a group of beasts several kilometers away, but I don’t know who trapped them with an array formation. They aren’t a threat. The powerful beast I encountered was quite far away, so it won’t pose a threat to us,” replied Meng He.

“Then, hurry up and recuperate!”

“Yes.”

Meng He meditated and circulated his spiritual energy to heal his injuries.

Not long after, he spat out another mouthful of blood. The blood was black. Extremely terrifying.

Was he poisoned?

Lucky I don’t wander around.

Indeed, one shouldn’t be reckless.

Han Jue pondered as he cultivated.

Chang Yue’er was also very uneasy.

It had only been two days, but Seventh Senior was already injured. The Ten Thousand Demon Realm was a truly savage place.

Why did Junior Han remain unscathed for so many years?

Chang Yue’er looked at Han Jue suspiciously.

Could he be more powerful than Seventh Senior?

...

After Meng He was injured, he didn’t dare to wander around anymore.

Han Jue was busy cultivating and didn’t go out.

Chang Yue’er naturally didn’t dare to go out, either.

A year quickly passed.

That day, Han Jue was cultivating.

Meng He suddenly opened his mouth and said, “The presence of beasts is getting stronger in the vicinity, and they’re moving rapidly. Their target... should be us!”

Han Jue and Chang Yue’er opened their eyes upon hearing that.

Han Jue said, “Then, why aren’t we running?”

Chang Yue’er frowned. “But this place is under the jurisdiction of the Jade Serene Peak. If we leave, aren’t we leaving our post without approval?”

“Then, stay and wait for your death. I’ll tell Master about your heroic deeds.”

Han Jue stood up.

Chang Yue’er got anxious and stood up as well.

“Junior Han is right. The eighteen peaks each have an area to manage. We definitely won’t be the only ones being attacked by the wave of beasts. Other people will definitely run as well,” said Meng He.

Ever since his defeat by the powerful best, he had lost his previous confidence.

“As long as we survive, there’s hope. Let’s go!”

After Han Jue said that, he rushed out of the pavilion. Chang Yue’er and Meng He followed closely behind.

The three of them flew on their swords.

Once they were high in the air, they lowered their heads to take a look. Indeed, with the pavilion as the center, countless beasts were running towards them from all directions.

Cold sweat broke out on Han Jue’s forehead.

So many!

It seemed like he was still not vigilant enough. He still needed to train his divine sense.

If not for Meng He’s reminder, they would definitely be in huge trouble now.

Swish!

An air-piercing sound came from ahead. The three of them turned their heads and saw a black eagle with a wingspan of thirty feet speeding over. Its feathers were like metal arrows.

“Be careful!”

Meng He immediately took out a talisman and quickly chanted a spell. Three balls of flames shot out from the talisman at the black eagle.

The black eagle dodged rapidly and circled in the air before continuing to pounce on the three of them.

At the same time, other flying beasts also attacked.

Han Jue took a glance. There was a total of seven of them!

All zooming at a break-neck speed.

Chang Yue’er was so frightened that her face turned pale, and her hand holding her equipment trembled.

Also frightened, Meng He shouted, “Let’s split up and escape!”

Han Jue cursed silently.

So you want to escape alone!

On the surface, Han Jue and Chang Yue’er’s cultivation levels were inferior to Meng He’s. They were, in fact, his burden.

Meng He turned around and escaped. He cast a spell and transformed into a gust of wind, escaping extremely quickly.

Chang Yue’er didn’t know what to do. This was the first time she had encountered such a dangerous situation.

Seeing the seven demon beasts approaching like rockets, Han Jue immediately used the Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique.

The sword shadows immediately materialized and zapped out.

Chang Yue’er only saw a flash of light in front of her, and the seven flying beasts were cut into several pieces, dying on the spot.

She widened her eyes and looked at Han Jue in disbelief.

Han Jue’s long hair fluttered in the wind. His eyes were cold and sharp, emitting an awe-inspiring aura.

[Chang Yue’er’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 4 stars]

Han Jue’s expression changed.

Crap!

He turned around and saw that Chang Yue’er was looking at him with glowing eyes.

Meng He had already fled without a trace.

That brat’s really quick!

Chang Yue’er excitedly said, “Junior Han, so you’re actually this powerful!”

Han Jue said seriously, “Senior Chang, don’t tell anyone what you saw. I still want to keep a low profile and cultivate quietly. If I’m exposed, I might become a core candidate. If that happens, you won’t be seeing me anymore!”

Chang Yue’er immediately nodded.
