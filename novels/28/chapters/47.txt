First level of the Soul Formation Realm!

Three thousand years of life!

Han Jue was pleasantly surprised.

The Nascent Soul realm was only a little over a thousand years old, but the Soul Formation realm directly tripled his lifespan!

Great!

Immediately, Han Jue took out the Burning Fiend Bell and covered himself before continuing to consolidate his cultivation.

Two days later.

Han Jue began to inherit the legacy of the Ten Thousand Sword Sect.

Ten Thousand Sword Sect was a large-scale killing technique. The Heavenly Punishment Ghost Deity Sword was more like a straight-line attack. Both had their strengths.

Relying on his top-notch sword cultivation potential and comprehension ability, Han Jue grasped the Ten Thousand Sword Sect in less than half a day.

He stood up and left.

Arriving at the teleportation formation, the disciples guarding it looked at him with admiration.

The commotion from the tribulation was too terrifying. The disciples immediately thought of the Deity Slaying Elder.

Before long...

Han Jue returned to his cave abode.

The moment it saw him return, the Black Hell Chicken immediately perked up and rushed over. “Master, you’re finally back! I thought you were eaten by that woman!”

Han Jue glared at it and said angrily, “What are you thinking all day with that chicken brain of yours?”

“Master, am I not a phoenix?”

“But you’re a chicken now. Cultivate before you become a phoenix.”

“Fine.”

The Black Hell Chicken was stunned. Cultivate well? How long do I have to cultivate?

Han Jue sat on the bed and continued cultivating.

He absorbed Qi as he activated the simulation trial.

He set Huang Jihao’s cultivation level to the ninth level of the Soul Formation Realm.

Insta-kill!

Han Jue was satisfied.

It’s settled!

When the Raincoat Sect comes, I’ll teach them a lesson!

Han Jue thought for a moment and set Huang Jihao’s cultivation level to the first level of the Void Amalgamation Realm.

It took Han Jue five minutes to kill him.

He frowned.

No!

Too long!

I’ve to continue cultivating!

The smugness in Han Jue’s heart dissipated, replaced by a strong sense of danger.

If he couldn’t insta-kill the enemy, the enemy would have a chance to turn the tables!

...

In a dark underground palace.

Zhou Fan and Yang Tiandong sat in a corner.

Paying attention to the Raincoat Sect members, Zhou Fan asked, “Why are there so few of them?”

Yang Tiandong opened his eyes when he heard this, and then he said in a low voice, “Something might have happened.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He immediately became excited.

Is Master coming to save me?

Zhou Fan narrowed his eyes and whispered, “Little brother, do you want to escape again?”

Yang Tiandong shuddered. “Senior, forget it. Let’s just wait for the sect to save us.”

“Useless!”

“I don’t want to be beaten...”

“We cultivators are not afraid of such pain. How can you prove your Dao Heart? How can you pursue the path of immortality?”

“I understand, but it’s really painful...”

Yang Tiandong’s expression was as if he was wearing a mask of pain. Recalling the torture, he couldn’t help but tremble.

Zhou Fan was frustrated and felt that Yang Tiandong was useless.

Boom!

The underground palace shook violently.

Li Qingzi’s voice followed, “All disciples of the Jade Pure Sect, prepare to resist. Kill your way out and destroy the Raincoat Sect with me!”

Zhou Fan and Yang Tiandong were overjoyed.

They were finally here!

...

A year passed in the blink of an eye after breaking through to the Soul Formation realm.

Han Jue was still in seclusion.

Occasionally, he would pay attention to the emails. By the looks of things, the Jade Pure Sect and the Raincoat Sect were at war.

Guan Yougang and Li Qingzi were heavily injured again. It was truly tragic.

His disciple, Yang Tiandong, had also been attacked by the Raincoat Sect. It seemed that he had already joined the main force, which was why he had been able to keep fighting.

Han Jue could only cheer for them in his heart.

He had an even more important duty, which was to protect the Jade Pure Sect.

Now, Han Jue was not worried about the Raincoat Sect launching a sneak attack on the Jade Pure Sect. Instead, he was worried about enemies far away.

What was worth mentioning was that the cultivation of the Black Hell Chicken was already equivalent to a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Its cultivation speed was getting faster and faster.

It was lying in a corner like an elephant. Its feathers were extremely magnificent. Although it was a chicken, it had the aura of a divine pheasant.

When Han Jue sized up the Black Hell Chicken in satisfaction, Xuan Qingjun suddenly came to visit.

Seeing her again, Han Jue’s expression was very unnatural.

Although Xuan Qingjun was only at the Foundation Establishment realm, there was a Mahayana Demon Lord hidden in her soul that he could not offend.

“I heard that our Deity Slaying Elder broke through in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm?” Xuan Qingjun sat beside him and asked with a smile.

For the past year, there had been rumors that a mighty figure had transcended the tribulation in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm. Even the Nascent Soul elders did not dare approach. The disciples guessed that it was the mysterious Deity Slaying Elder.

Han Jue was very unnatural. His body was a little stiff. He pretended to be calm and asked, “Why are you looking for me?”

Was she going to start...

Oh, his virginity...

Han Jue panicked.

“I’m leaving. I came to say goodbye.” Xuan Qingjun smiled.

Han Jue was stunned.

Leaving?

Xuan Qingjun asked, “What do you want before I leave? I’ll try my best to satisfy you. I don’t know how long it’ll be before we meet again.”

Han Jue asked in surprise, “You’re leaving just like that? You’re not going to...”

Xuan Qingjun rolled her eyes at him and snorted. “You seem excited for it, keep dreaming. I need you, but not now. Don’t think that I’ll stay with you every day. It’s not time yet.”

That’s good! Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

He almost lost his virginity.

He muttered, “Are there any pills that can increase the cultivation of Soul Formation Realm cultivators?”

Xuan Qingjun immediately took out four pill bottles from her sleeve. “These are Soul Formation Spirit Enhancing Pills. I only have these four bottles on me. I’ll give them all to you.”

Han Jue thanked her hurriedly.

Xuan Qingjun reached out and used her finger to lift his chin. She smiled and said, “I won’t be able to bear not seeing your face for many years. However, it’s inconvenient for me to bring you along. In the future, you should stay in the Jade Pure Sect and cultivate well. Don’t run around. The cultivation world is very dangerous. Although you’re already at the Soul Formation realm, you’re not invincible.”

Han Jue nodded unnaturally.

Xuan Qingjun teased him and left.

Han Jue wiped the cold sweat on his forehead.

The pressure the Demon Lord gave him was truly great.

It seemed that the Demon Lord was really only passing by the Jade Pure Sect and did not have any ulterior motives. She was probably going to other places to comprehend the Dao and experience the myriad forms of life.

Sigh, my damned unparalleled charm. Even the Demon Lord couldn’t resist it.

But then again...

How fragrant!

Han Li looked at the four bottles of Soul Formation Stage Spirit Enhancing Pills beside him in joy.

After Xuan Qingjun left, the Black Hell Chicken said excitedly, “Congratulations, Master. You don’t have to worry about being eaten by her anymore!”

Han Jue couldn’t be bothered with it and continued practicing.

He wanted to master the fifth level of the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique first before taking pills to strengthen his cultivation.
