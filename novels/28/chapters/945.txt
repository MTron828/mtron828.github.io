Chapter 948 Han Jue’s Disappointment

“That’s only your guess. According to you, you want to sacrifice all the living beings in the Heavenly Dao for the sake of saving the chaotic lifeforms? Do you think this is really righteous?” Jiang Jueshi stared at Carefree Immortal and asked coldly.

Hearing this, Carefree Immortal laughed as if he had heard the most ridiculous thing in the world.

“Only in the Chaos can there be righteousness. Don’t you understand what I just said? The Heavenly Dao is different from the Chaos. Heavenly Dao would have long been destroyed if not for the Dao Ancestor suppressing its development.”

As the Carefree Immortal spoke, he shook his head and sighed. “How impressive was the Dao Ancestor back then? He single-handedly pulled up the Heavenly Dao and resisted the enemies of the Chaos many times. Unfortunately, in the end, he was still abandoned by everyone. Now that he has disappeared, who among the living beings in the Heavenly Dao remembers his kindness?

“The Dao Ancestor is the same, so is the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.”

Jiang Jueshi was silent.

Han Huang cursed. “Even if you absorb my potential and creation, you’re not my father’s match. Just wait for death!”

Carefree Immortal smiled. “Then let’s wait and see.”

With that, he suddenly vanished.

Only Jiang Jueshi, Han Huang, and Han Qing’er were left in the blank domain.

Han Qing’er had yet to awaken.

Han Huang wanted to move, but he discovered that he could only twist his body. This domain was too strange. He couldn’t borrow strength, and the Dharmic powers in his body were already gone.

Jiang Jueshi was the same. He frowned and scanned his surroundings. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He had never heard of such a place. He felt very uneasy.

“He must know that we can’t escape if he dares to leave.”

Jiang Jueshi sighed.

Han Huang was extremely aggrieved and had nowhere to vent his anger.

After a long while…

Han Qing’er woke up and learned of this from her two brothers. She was very calm.

“Second Brother, have you forgotten the Mystical Power Father taught us? Summon him now!” Han Qing’er said in a low voice with a mysterious expression.

Han Huang’s expression darkened. “How can I have the face to summon him? I said that I would rely on myself, but… Besides, the other party is waiting to scheme against Father. Aren’t I falling into his trap?”

Han Qing’er rolled her eyes. “He just obtained your potential and Senior Brother’s creation. He needs time to become stronger. Father won’t know if we don’t inform him immediately. Isn’t this giving that fellow time to become stronger?”

Han Huang was silent.

Jiang Jueshi said, “You can summon him before removing the Mystical Power. It’s equivalent to informing Master that something happened. Then, you can wait for Master to visit us in our dreams. Find out the reason first and then Master will make a decision.”

Han Qing’er’s eyes lit up. Then, she ignored Han Huang and began to use the Invocation Technique.

She severed the Mystical Power feed as soon as the black vortex formed.

On the other side.

Han Jue was actually a little hesitant. After all, the blank domain was very likely the hiding place of the Dao Creators.

However, the black vortex disappeared very quickly.

Han Jue immediately understood what the other party meant.

It should not be interrupted.

After Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple, he sent dreams from time to time but couldn’t succeed. He could try again now.

He immediately sent a dream to Han Huang.

As expected.

He succeeded!

The dream was a blank domain, hinting to Han Huang that Han Jue knew this place.

However, Han Huang thought that the dream was his own thoughts, so he did not think too much about it.

Seeing Han Jue, he looked ashamed and didn’t know what to say.

Han Jue asked, “Who captured you? Do you know his name?”

Han Huang shook his head. “He didn’t reveal his name.”

“Show me his image.”

Han Huang immediately waved his hand. In the dream, his Dharmic powers had recovered. In any case, it was all fake.

Han Jue noted down the Carefree Immortal’s appearance.

Seeing that Han Jue’s expression didn’t change, the grievance in Han Huang’s heart immediately turned into sadness. He then told him what had happened.

His potential was the thing he was most proud of. He had been a genius since he was young. He didn’t dare to imagine what would happen if he became trash.

That would be worse than death!

Han Jue was a little surprised.

Snatching people’s potential and stealing their opportunities!

He even had an Ultimate Dao Treasure!

It was indeed impressive.

From low to high, Dharma treasures were respectively the Heavenly Dao Numinous Treasure, Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure, Freedom Numinous Treasure, Freedom Supreme Treasure, Great Dao Numinous Treasure, Great Dao Supreme Treasure, Ultimate Dao Treasure, and Ultimate Supreme Treasure. Among them, Great Dao Dharma treasures could also be called Chaotic Dharma treasures.

Han Jue also had an Ultimate Dao Treasure and an even stronger Ultimate Supreme Treasure.

However, there were only a few Ultimate Dharma treasures in the Chaos. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit and the Primordial Ancestral God had never revealed them.

This was a very good opponent!

Han Jue asked, “What’s the other party’s cultivation level?”

He was looking forward to it.

It was also a good thing that an opponent had appeared during the boring cultivation years.

It could motivate him and make his life interesting

Han Huang said, “He’s a Great Dao Supreme. He should become stronger in the future.”

“What? Great Dao Supreme?”

Han Jue’s eyes widened, scaring Han Huang.

Han Jue muttered, “That’s it?”

He was so excited for nothing!

Han Jue looked at him and said, “Stay there. You’re outside the Chaos. It’s a blank domain. No living being can survive or cultivate in it. It just so happens that your potential has been deprived. You can reflect on it.

“Not only do you need invincible potential, but you also need an invincible heart. Don’t let your cultivation enslave you. This is a training you must undergo.”

Han Huang was deep in thought.

The dream ended.

Han Qing’er hurriedly asked when she saw that he woke up, “What did Father say?”

Han Huang replied, “He said that this is a blank domain outside the Chaos, and he asked us to stay here for the time being and calm down. Treat it as training.”

Jiang Jueshi smiled. “Since Master knows where we are, it means that he’s already confident.”

Han Qing’er wailed. “Then how long are we going to stay here?”

Han Huang did not say anything else and reflected on his father’s words.

Heart of Invincibility!

Don’t be enslaved by cultivation…

Inside the Daoist temple.

Han Jue opened his eyes. “I want to know if the person in my mind can be insta-killed by

me?”

(1 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Han Jue hesitated.

With this level…

How disappointing!

However, he still chose to continue when he thought of that mysterious Ultimate Dao Treasure.

(Yes]

Han Jue asked in his mind, “Can I insta-kill him when he comes to me?”

The Carefree Immortal definitely didn’t know his true strength.

(100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

The cost had increased by a hundred times!

This fellow was still a little stable. After obtaining the invincible potential and creation, he still endured until he was a hundred times stronger before attacking.

What a pity!

A hundred times was not enough!

Continue!

[Yes]

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

He asked, “Where is this person?”

(The other party has an Ultimate Dao Treasure that cannot be deduced.]

How strange. He could deduce the cultivation level but not the location.

It seemed that this Ultimate Dao Treasure was not simple.

He would kill this fellow and grab the treasure when the time came.

Han Jue asked again, “Will the other party kill Han Huang, Han Qing’er, and Jiang Jueshi before coming to find me?”

(100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[No]

Yes, this fellow was trustworthy.

He was only targeting Han Jue and not lying to Han Huang and the other two.
