Chapter 232 Tai Sutian, Jie School

Han Jue hurriedly checked his interpersonal relationships and found Tai Sutian.

It was the portrait of a beautiful woman.

(Tai Sutian: Cultivation unknown. A mysterious existence nurtured by the 33 Layered Heavens. Lives in Nüwa Imperial Palace all year round and listens to the sage’s preach. Under the orders of the sage, she threw the Heaven Mending Stone into the mortal world of the Heavenly Court to find a prodigy without a powerful background. Because you refined the Heaven Mending Stone into a living being and canceled out its previous providence, Tai Sutian is interested in you. Current favorability: 1 star.]

Her cultivation level was unknown, so she was an Immortal Emperor at least!

Han Jue frowned.

Sage…

Wasn’t Nüwa the sage of the Nüwa Imperial Palace?

It seemed that the Chinese myths were all true. Perhaps Earth was just a corner of the universe.

Han Jue was a little nervous.

The name ‘Tai Sutian’ sounded very impressive. He wondered if the Heavenly Emperor could continue to protect him.

Should he ask? Han Jue immediately took out the Heavenly Dao Token and contacted Di Taibai. Di Taibai quickly connected with his divine sense and did not neglect him. “What is it?”

“Can I speak to His Majesty?”

“As I said, His Majesty is busy every day. Unless it’s something important, it’s best not to disturb him.”

“I have something private to ask.” “If it’s a private matter, I’ll help you resolve it!”

Han Jue cursed silently. Di Taibai was really enthusiastic.

“I’m here.”

The Heavenly Emperor’s voice suddenly sounded. Han Jue was stunned.

Di Taibai was also stunned.

The two of them cursed in their hearts.

Han Jue: Are you a stalker?

Di Taibai: Is he the son of the Heavenly Emperor?

Di Taibai didn’t dare to interfere and hurriedly severed his divine sense connection.

Han Jue chased Dao Comprehension Sword out first before contacting the Heavenly Emperor.

“Your Majesty, do you know about the Nüwa Palace?” Han Jue asked carefully.

The Heavenly Emperor asked in surprise, “Why?”

Han Jue said, “The inheritance I obtained is related to Reincarnation. I have a certain understanding of fate. I picked up a stone and calculated that it came from above the 33 heavens.”

The Heavenly Emperor fell silent. Seeing that he didn’t receive an immediate reply, Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat.

Crap. Was his backing not enough?

The Heavenly Emperor said, “Could that stone be the Heaven Mending Stone?”

Han Jue asked curiously, “What’s the Heaven Mending Stone?”

“It’s fine. Cultivate in peace. You’re mine. Nüwa Palace will never target you. Nüwa Palace has never fought for fame or fortune.”

“Your Majesty, it’s best to be cautious. People change.”

“Yes, I know. Do you have anything else to

ask?”

“Then, I won’t disturb Your Majesty.”

“When you reach the perfected Golden Immortal Realm, you can come to the Heavenly Court to find me. I’ll think of a way to help you reach the Emperor Realm.”

“Thank you, Your Majesty!”

Han Jue cupped his fists and smiled, feeling disdainful.

Hmph!

Trying to lure me into the sky?

Impossible!

Looks like the Heavenly Emperor was also sent by the Heavenly Dao. You want to destroy my Dao heart?

The outcome of the Divine General was still vivid in his mind. He looked majestic, but he was just working hard and was too tired all the time.

He could repay the Heavenly Court, but there was no need to work like a donkey and risk his life.

Han Jue stood up and walked out of the cave abode towards the Fusang Tree.

The eight gourds didn’t seem to have changed. Han Jue scanned with his divine sense and caught their weak soul fluctuations.

Now that they had souls, they were spirits.

Not bad! Not bad!

Han Jue said, “The eight gourds have become spirits. Take care of them.”

Everyone stood up and surrounded him. Han Jue looked at the gourds for a while before returning.

It was very difficult for the eight gourds to transform in a short period of time. He still needed to wait for a while.

To celebrate this matter, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing. At the same time, he checked his emails.

(Because of your curse, your enemy Heavenly Rage God has lost his Buddhist heart, and his inner demon has transformed him into a Demonic Buddha.]

(Your disciple Su Qi was attacked by a cultivator from the Sacred Dynasty and was imprisoned in the Luck Suppression Prison.] (Your good friend Zhou Fan slaughtered a cultivation family. His negative karma has increased greatly.]

(Your grand-disciple Fang Liang was attacked by a cultivator] x15033

[Your good friend Ji Xianshen has comprehended a Mystical Power. His providence has increased greatly.)

(Your good friend Zhang Guxing was attacked by the Divine Palace Immortal Emperor.]

[Your Dao Companion Xuan Qingjun is listening to the Dao in the Jie School. Her cultivation has increased greatly.]

Unfortunately, the Evil Wyrm King didn’t have any interaction with Han Jue. Han Jue also didn’t know how the Evil Wyrm King was doing

It was fine to spend five days every ten years cursing

Han Jue thought silently.

He was very curious about Xuan Qingjun’s opportunity. The Jie School was an enemy sect of the Heavenly Court. What would happen if they met her in the future? It was worth mentioning that Xuan Qingjun’s cultivation had already reached the perfected Grand Unity Heaven Immortal Realm.

This breakthrough speed was considered fast. After all, she had obtained an opportunity from the Jie School.

After cursing for half a year, Han Jue continued cultivating.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

No matter what, he couldn’t mess up his cultivation rhythm!

In a Daoist temple, wearing a Daoist robe, Xuan Qingjun sat on a mat with several disciples of the Jie School. In front of them was a Daoist nun.

The Daoist nun had an indifferent expression as she said, “After the lecture ends, all of you should cultivate well when you return. You’re not allowed to leave the island.” “Yes!” the disciples replied in unison. Then, they stood up and bowed, preparing to leave. “Xuan Qingjun, stay.” Xuan Qingjun sat down again.

Her expression was calm as she waited for her master to speak.

The Daoist nun said, “You have joined the Jie School for a period of time. Do you have a Dao Companion?”

Xuan Qingjun replied, “I have a Dao Companion in the mortal world. His potential is outstanding and he’s the number one in the mortal world. He might have already ascended.”

Hearing this, the Daoist nun frowned slightly and said regretfully, “Then forget it. I still wanted to introduce you to a Dao Companion. What a pity.”

Xuan Qingjun smiled.

“A long time ago, the Jie School was defeated in the Immeasurable Calamity. Many disciples were imprisoned in the Heavenly Court. Prepare yourself. Before long, the Jie School will launch a surprise attack on the Heavenly Court,” the Daoist nun continued.

Xuan Qingjun frowned. “Can our Jie School defeat the Heavenly Court?”

She had been in the Jie School for some time. She felt that although they had some mighty figures, there were few disciples.

The Daoist nun smiled and said, “You underestimate our Jie School. Even the Heavenly Emperor has to address our Sect Master respectfully as a senior. The island we’re on is only one of the hundred thousand islands of the Jie School. Most of the disciples are gathered on the Penglai Immortal Island.”

Xuan Qingjun was enlightened and became even more curious about the Jie School.

What kind of force was the Jie School?

Thirty years later.

The eight gourd spirits had already begun to speak, but they had yet to land and transform.

The seven Earth Immortal Gourd Spirits were named by Han Jue as Han One to Han Seven, while the Chaotic Gourd Spirit was named Han Eight.

The names were simple and easy to recognize.

The disciples were speechless, but they didn’t dare to refute.

The gourds didn’t understand the meaning of their names, so they didn’t mind.

All these years, the cultivation levels of the eight gourds had been increasing rapidly. They were absorbing Immortal Qi, not Spirit Qi.

The weakest Han Eight had also stepped into the Mahayana Realm not long ago.

Their talent was stronger than Han Jue’s disciples. Compared to Long Hao and Chu Shiren, they were temporarily unable to compare.

On this day.

In the midst of cultivating, Han Jue suddenly opened his eyes.

He frowned and muttered, “This aura is…”

At the same time!

A huge crack appeared in the sky in the distant sea. Lightning interweaved and the crack was pitch black, like a netherworld abyss.
