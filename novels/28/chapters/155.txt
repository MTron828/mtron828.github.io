Chapter 156 Black and White Deities, Han Jue’s Limit

Defeating Ji Xianshen didn’t make Han Jue too happy.

The fact that Ji Xianshen had the time to challenge him meant that the True Devil Calamity had ended.

Han Jue understood something.

No matter who left the world, it would still continue to advance!

“From the looks of it, the devils are defeated and the demonic path is suppressed. The Heavenly Court shouldn’t need to clean up the mortal world, right?”

Han Jue thought silently.

No!

I have to have a foolproof plan!

Han Jue’s essence soul immediately left his body and jumped into the netherworld.

Jumping from the living world to the netherworld was faster than him rushing to the ends of the mortal world.

After becoming a Reincarnation Loose Immortal, Han Jue could clearly sense the existence of the netherworld and the Immortal World. Above was the Immortal World, and below was the netherworld. As for the other worlds, he couldn’t sense them for the time being. “Senior Meng Po!”

Han Jue shouted.

Ghost mist filled the surroundings. The world was dark and there was no sun or moon. It was like the deepest part of the abyss. “What is it?” Meng Po’s voice sounded.

Han Jue asked, “If I want to bring some people to the netherworld, can you allow it?”

“The living are not allowed to enter the netherworld. You can kill them. When the time comes, I’ll send their souls to you.”

Han Jue smiled and asked, “Senior, are you serious?”

Meng Po said helplessly, “I’m only a ghost servant. I can’t make decisions in the netherworld. If the Magus Race rises in the future, I can help you.”

“Then, what can you help me with now, Senior? You wanted me to accept Tu Lingler, so I took her in, but you can’t do anything for me. Do you want to… gain something for nothing?”

Meng Po fell silent.

Han Jue was also silent.

Could it be that Meng Po was angry and wanted to kill him?

If that was the case, he couldn’t befriend her!

Han Jue panicked.

After a while.

Meng Po sighed. “How about I give you two ghost servant spots?” Han Jue said helplessly, “I still have to kill them in that case.”

“I’ll give you a Resurrection Lily. It can increase Spirit Qi and produce fruits that can revive the dead.”

The Resurrection Lily could still bear fruit?

Han Jue learned something.

“Alright, how can I obtain the Resurrection Lily?” Han Jue asked.

“In the dead of the night, I’ll get the Black and White Deities to send it to your cave abode.”

“Alright!”

“I’ll leave Tu Ling’er in your care.”

“No problem.” Han Jue cupped his fists in the air and bowed before leaving

Late at night.

Han Jue patiently waited for the arrival of the Black and White Deities.

Speaking of which, he had never seen a ghost servant before. There were very few ghosts in the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. After all, it was a righteous sect with providence protecting it. After a disciple died, their soul would be directly reincarnated and sucked into the netherworld. They wouldn’t be reduced to wandering ghosts.

At midnight, a cold wind blew into the Connate Cave Abode. Two ghosts passed through the stone door, one black and one white.

They looked like the Black and White Deities of the legends. They wore long ghost robes and had sinister faces. Their tongues fell outside their mouths and reached their chests. They were quite terrifying. The two ghosts looked identical. The only difference was that they were black and white.

WO

Hanged ghosts?

Han Jue couldn’t help but retort internally.

Dao Comprehension Sword was still cultivating. She clearly could not sense the arrival of the Black and White Deities.

The Black Deity came in front of Han Jue and said respectfully, “Meng Po asked the two of us to bring this treasure to you.”

He waved his right hand, and a flower appeared on the table.

The leaves of the Resurrection Lily were red in color. The petals were narrow and thin as if thousands of red lines had burst out. It was strange and beautiful.

Han Jue immediately used the simulation trial test.

[Black and White Deities: Fifth level of the Loose Immortal Realm, Netherworld Ghost Servants] Only at the fifth level of the Loose Immortal Realm?

Han Jue thought that the Black and White Deities were very strong.

He asked curiously, “Are you two the only Black and White Deities in the Underworld?”

The White Deity smiled. “No, the two of us are only responsible for the Otherworldly Ghost Affairs in this mortal world.” The Black and White Deities of a mortal world?

“Farewell!”

The Black Deity cupped his hands and left with the White Deity. Before they reached the stone door, they vanished into thin air.

Han Jue stood up and picked up the Resurrection Lily. Dao Comprehension Sword asked curiously, “Who were you talking to just now?”

Hearing this, Han Jue casually replied, “Two ghost servants.”

Ghost servants?

Dao Comprehension Sword felt her blood run cold.

Why didn’t she see them?

Han Jue carefully sized up the Resurrection Lily. He could feel that this flower contained a huge amount of Spirit Qi and the Qi of Reincarnation.

As expected of a flower from the netherworld!

Han Jue couldn’t judge the value of the Resurrection Lily. He planted it in the corner of the cave abode.

“Take care of this flower in the future,” Han Jue instructed Dao Comprehension Sword.

Dao Comprehension Sword hurriedly nodded and stared at him planting the lily in the corner.

Han Jue returned to the bed and started cultivating

The Reincarnation Loose Immortal Realm was not divided into nine minor realms. It was divided into the early, middle, late, and perfect stages. Since it was divided into four levels, Han Jue would definitely take longer to break through each minor realm.

The more this was the case, the more Han Jue had to spend his energy on cultivation.

He couldn’t slack off!

Above the layers of clouds, a black crack appeared in the blue sky. Lightning flowed out like a snake.

A figure slowly stepped out from the black crack.

It was Daoist Jueyan

He opened his arms and breathed in the Spirit Qi of the mortal world. He sighed. “The mortal world is still the best.”

Another figure stepped out from the black crack behind him. It was a woman in black.

The woman had a cold expression and her beautiful hair was tied into a bun. Her posture was dignified, but there was a sinister look in her eyes.

“I won’t interfere in matters of the mortal world unless I encounter an existence that has surpassed the mortal world,” the black-robed woman said.

Daoist Jueyan hurriedly turned to look at her. He bowed and said, “Thank you for following me, Senior.”

The woman in black grunted coldly. “I wonder what relationship you have with him. Since he personally asked, I came to help you. Go on, I’ll stroll around the mortal world.”

Daoist Jueyan smiled apologetically and nodded.

The woman in black vanished.

Daoist Jueyan heaved a sigh of relief and smiled.

“Heavenly Immortal Manor… and the guy who killed my pet, don’t even think about escaping!”

Ten years passed after planting the Resurrection Lily.

Han Jue, who was cultivating, opened his eyes and frowned slightly.

For some reason, he had been feeling uneasy recently. This feeling was becoming stronger. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The last time was when a True Devil attacked.

Is the Devil Race up to something again?

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the Vermilion Bird to vent.

He cursed as he checked his interpersonal relationships.

After so many years, his friends had all improved.

The slowest were the original elders of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect, including Li Qingzi. His potential was too mediocre.

The current Jade Pure Sacred Sect was already considered a holy land. The disciples they recruited were not only from the Great Yan but also from the surrounding states. Their aptitudes far exceeded the previous disciples.

As the Jade Pure Sacred Sect became stronger, the elders also constantly changed. Most of the people had left by themselves as they could not withstand the pressure.

When the average cultivation level of the core disciples reached the Nascent Soul realm, the Nascent Soul realm elders were indeed very embarrassed.

No, I can’t increase my cultivation level for the time being. I have to strengthen my Mystical Power. After all, the Heavenly Court can come at any time.

Han Jue thought silently.

Six days later, he began to comprehend the Three Pure World Cleansing.

A month later, he continued to study the Somersault Cloud.

He couldn’t only think of insta-kill, but also develop in all directions!

A year later.

Han Jue comprehended his Mystical Powers and Sword Intent to their limits.

He heaved a sigh of relief as the uneasiness in his heart finally dissipated.

I knew it!

Safety still depended on one’s own strength!
