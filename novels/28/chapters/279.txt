Chapter 282 Hao Tian Shows His Might, Join Forces to Kill the Demon Emperor

The Golden Crow Divine Emperor looked down at Jiang Yi and smiled disdainfully. “Give you face? Jiang Yi, who do you think you are?

“If not for the fact that we are separated by generations, would you be worthy of being the number one prodigy of the Golden Crow Divine Clan? If you were of the same generation as me, your Dao heart would have long been crushed by me!” Jiang Yi was furious.

He took out a token and said coldly, “This is the token of the Demon Venerable. It can command the entire clan. I order you now to not pester Han Jue anymore!”

The True Sun Flame on the Golden Crow Divine Emperor’s body surged violently and quickly condensed into a human figure

After transforming, the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor walked towards Jiang Yi step by step. His gaze was cold as he revealed a sinister smile.

“The Demon Venerable also wants to care about me? After I reach the Deity Realm, the next leader of the Golden Crow Divine Clan will be me!

“Jiang Yi, you’re too arrogant. Since you want to plead for mercy for the guardian of the Reroll World, you can die too! “I’ll let you taste pain on his behalf first!”

The Golden Crow Divine Emperor laughed wildly, his tone filled with killing intent.

He charged towards Jiang Yi.

Jiang Yi’s expression changed drastically. He took out a sword with his right hand and immediately fought.

“I’m the strongest prodigy in the history of the Golden Crow Divine Clan!” Jiang Yi roared in his heart. He was also infuriated by the Golden Crow Divine Emperor’s arrogance.

Do you really think I’m afraid of you?

Time passed slowly.

Another twenty years passed by.

Han Jue felt the beauty of life again. Without the threat of powerful enemies, he could cultivate in peace.

The peace and serenity caused his cultivation speed to increase greatly.

In addition to the negative karma of the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus, Han Jue was getting closer and closer to becoming a Rank Three Immortal Emperor.

While his cultivation increased, Han Jue’s physique also became stronger.

Under the development of the Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering Technique, even Han Jue himself felt that the Stellar Primordial Body was becoming more and more terrifying.

It would simply be unimaginable when he stepped into the Deity Realm!

Ten years passed.

Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and continued cursing the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor, the Demon Emperor, and Golden Roc Demon Lord.

While cursing, he checked his emails.

He suddenly saw an email and frowned.

(Your good friend Jiang Yi was attacked by your enemy Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor. He died and his Dao dissipated. A trace of his soul was preserved by his ancestors.]

Fighting among fellow clansmen? Han Jue suddenly thought of a possibility.

Could it be that Jiang Yi was attacked by the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor?

No.

That fellow was so arrogant.

Han Jue frowned. He was in a bad mood.

He checked his interpersonal relationships and heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that Jiang Yi’s portrait was still there.

He was dead, but not completely.

Fortunately!

It had to be said that the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor was truly too savage.

Han Jue’s eyes were firm.

He had to think of a way to kill the Golden Crow Divine Emperor. Otherwise, his Dao ‘heart would be damaged.

A month later, Han Jue entered the simulation trial. Unfortunately, he still couldn’t defeat the Golden Crow Divine Emperor.

He had to cultivate more!

Just as Han Jue was sighing, Dao Comprehension Sword walked into the cave abode and stopped in front of him. “Hao’er wants to see you.”

Han Jue opened his eyes and said, “Let him

in.”

Dao Comprehension Sword immediately sent a message.

Recently, Long Hao’s cultivation speed had increased greatly. Something was wrong.

Soon, Long Hao quickly knelt down in front of Han Jue and said respectfully, “Master, I often dream when I cultivate recently. In my dreams, a mysterious person is teaching me a Mystical Power, but I can’t see his true appearance.”

He was an Immortal God. How could he dream?

It was too abnormal!

Han Jue narrowed his eyes. As expected, Hao Tian had begun to make his move.

Han Jue had always been wary of him.

This strongest Heavenly Emperor was clearly up to something. “Other than teaching you the Mystical Power, is there anything else?” Han Jue asked.

Long Hao gritted his teeth and hesitated for a moment before saying, “He said that I’m someone who will face the calamity. I’ll overturn the myriad worlds and slaughter the Heavenly Court… But I’m the son of the Heavenly Emperor. How can I…”, He was terrified.

He had also heard a lot about the Immeasurable Calamity from the Black Hell Demon Lord and Xun Chang’an.

It was said that when the calamity developed to the extreme, all living beings would be controlled by negative karma, unable to control themselves and sink into slaughter.

He was afraid that he would do the same.

Han Jue consoled, “It’s fine. As long as you stay here, you won’t be in trouble.”

Wait. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Han Jue suddenly thought of something and felt uneasy.

If something happened to Long Hao’s family, would he want to go to the Immortal World?

Currently, the Heavenly Court was facing danger. There was no guarantee that something would happen. Did Hao Tian predict this moment to bewitch Long Hao?

When Long Hao heard Han Jue’s words, he immediately felt much better.

He trusted him the most. Han Jue’s status in his heart was even higher than the Heavenly Emperor. After all, he had never seen the Heavenly Emperor since he was born. The Heavenly Emperor had only seen him twice in the few years he was in the Heavenly Court.

Long Hao felt a little sad every time he thought of this.

He knew that he still had many brothers and sisters who worked under the Heavenly Emperor.

Han Jue said, “Ignore the person in the dream and don’t cultivate his Mystical Power.”

Long Hao nodded.

Then, Han Jue began to preach the Dao to him, wanting to negate Hao Tian’s influence.

Long Hao left after a month.

Not long after he left, Tu Ling’er came in next.

“Master, can I leave Hidden Sect Island? I want to go to the netherworld. I feel something calling me,” Tu Ling’er asked expectantly.

Han Jue immediately rejected it. “No. If you leave, you won’t be my disciple anymore!”

Tu Ling’er, the reincarnated Grand Magus, was definitely bewitched by the Magus Race. The calamity had arrived. Han Jue couldn’t be bothered with Meng Po. He only hoped that Tu Ling’er wouldn’t cause trouble for him and expose the whereabouts of Hidden Sect Island.

Even someone as strong as Meng Po would be attacked from time to time. If Tu Ling’er went out, she would definitely ask for help.

Tu Ling’er immediately felt wronged.

Han Jue said seriously, “The Immeasurable Calamity has started. Once you leave, the Hidden Sect might face a calamity because of you. The Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor is still looking for us. Do you really want to get us all killed?”

Tu Ling’er hurriedly shook her head in fear, not daring to say that she wanted to go out.

Then, Han Jue taught her a Mystical Power and let her leave.

Dao Comprehension Sword sat on her mat and sighed. “Master, is this the calamity? It’s bewitching us to go out?”

“Good, you’ve finally understood.”

“Don’t worry. No matter what, I won’t go out!”

“Good girl.”

Han Jue smiled in satisfaction.

The people in the entire Hidden Sect that made him the least worried were the Black Hell Chicken, Li Yao, and Dao Comprehension Sword.

In fact, the three of them were afraid of being chased out.

Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.

Next, he wanted to break through to the Rank Three Immortal Emperor Realm!

When he reached this realm, he might be able to fight the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor!

Year after year passed. Another fifty years went by.

In the midst of cultivating, Han Jue seemed to sense something and suddenly opened his eyes.

“Oh? Why is he looking for me?”

Han Jue closed his eyes again and jumped into the Chaotic Domain.

The Chaotic Domain was a place that Han Jue entered when he became an Emperor. Only the Chaotic Physique could enter it.

Divine Palace’s Dao Sovereign said that he had something to talk about.

Seeing Han Jue appear, Dao Sovereign said, “Fellow Daoist, do you dare to join forces with me to kill the Demon Emperor?”
