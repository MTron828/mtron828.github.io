Chapter 1065 Nine Divine Stars, Nine Extremes Orthodoxy

Mo Zang was frightened and didn’t know what to do upon facing the murderous Han Jue.

Han Jue said coldly, “I’ll kill your master now!” His eyes narrowed. Mo Zang saw him turn around and attack Mo Zhu. The unfathomable Mo Zhu in his eyes was directly blown away. “No-” Mo Zang shouted miserably. He suddenly stood up and rushed towards Han Jue.

Just as he stood up, he was imprisoned by an invisible force and was unable to move.

Mo Zang looked at him with bloodshot eyes. His eyes were filled with hatred and killing intent.

“Stop teasing him. He’s just a kid.”

Mo Zhu’s voice suddenly floated over. Mo Zang subconsciously glanced over. Mo Zhu, who had just been reduced to ashes, had appeared again and was walking towards them.

Looking at Han Jue again, the coldness on his face disappeared and was replaced by a refreshing smile. Coupled with his extremely handsome face, even Mo Zang was a little absent-minded.

“What’s happening?” Mo Zang asked in a puzzled tone upon sensing that the powerful force binding him had disappeared.

No matter how stupid he was, he could tell that Han Jue was not an enemy. He was teasing him just now.

Mo Zhu walked to Han Jue’s side and asked, “Are you here for him?”

Han Jue smiled and nodded.

Mo Zhu looked at Mo Zhou and said, “Hurry up

and kneel down to acknowledge your

ancestor.”

“Ancestor?”

Mo Zang was stunned. He naturally believed his master’s words, so he knelt down and kowtowed to Han Jue.

Han Jue looked at him and asked, “How have

you been all these years?”

Mo Zhu looked at him with a complicated expression. “Not bad. Thank you for taking care of me.”

The two of them looked at each other in silence. The past floated before their eyes.

Han Jue no longer cared about their past, but to Mo Zhu, the memories were vivid. Along the way, she could be said to have listened to Han Jue’s legendary deeds as she cultivated. She felt regret and helplessness, and then gradually became determined.

Han Jue didn’t object to Mo Zhu choosing her

family back then. Everyone had their own choices. He had never wanted everyone to

revolve around him.

Han Jue looked at Mo Zang and asked, “Do you

feel the power in your body?”

Mo Zang asked in surprise, “Could this power

be your…”

He could tell that this ancestor in front of him

had a close relationship with his master. Could it be because of this relationship that his

master accepted him?

Mo Zang had mixed emotions.

Han Jue smiled. “It’s good that you understand. You don’t have to say it.”

Mo Zang was silent.

Han Jue smiled and said, “I’ll stay here and teach you for a period of time.”

He looked at Mo Zhu.

Mo Zhu hurriedly said, “You can stay if you

want…”

She became nervous. This emotion had not 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

appeared for more than a hundred million years. It was so long that she almost forgot that

she was also alone.

Just like that, Han Jue’s clone stayed.

The other eight clones were the same. They

didn’t directly save the other eight descendants of the Creation Heaven’s Chosen but gave them

a process of acceptance.

Han Jue’s main body returned to the third Daoist temple.

“After some time, I’ll bring back nine

descendants who can be considered your juniors. You’ll have to take care of them.”

Shan’e opened his eyes.

He asked carefully, “Could it be that they were

also…”

“Mm.”

Han Jue nodded. Shan’e became even more

nervous.

Nine powerful competitors were coming. Could

it be that the progenitor was dissatisfied with his cultivation progress?

Han Jue said, “You don’t have to think too

much. There will be more in the future. I can’t

only nurture you. I’ll do this every once in a

while. You’ll also build good karma if you can teach them and take care of them.” Shan’e felt that it made sense and immediately

agreed.

A hundred years later.

Han Jue’s nine clones returned with nine

descendants. Not only them but even Mo Zhu was brought back and stayed in the third Dao

Field.

Upon seeing Mo Zhu, Xing Hongxuan, Fairy Xi Xuan, and Chang Yue’er were all overjoyed. Time had passed, and it was not easy to meet

an old friend.

Inside the Daoist temple.

The nine descendants of the Han family meditated side by side and looked at Han Jue in

admiration.

All these years, Han Jue’s clone had already become familiar with them and established a

relationship. After coming to the third Dao Field, they heard the progenitor’s title, Divine Might Heavenly Sage!

This name was the supreme word of the Heavenly Dao!

They didn’t know about the ancestor and

Pangu until the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was the guardian of the Heavenly Dao. They didn’t expect their progenitor to have

such a background.

Shan’e looked at the nine new faces and

sighed.

He seemed to see nine unparalleled mighty

figures about to rise. Although these guys looked young, he could sense the mysterious power in their bodies and their limitless

potential.

“I’ll give you great opportunities and allow you

to be reborn. What you have to do is cultivate here well. You are not allowed to leave without my permission. You might have to spend

hundreds of millions of years here or even longer,” Han Jue said seriously. No one retorted because Han Jue’s clone had already told them before coming. Next, Han Jue began to preach. After preaching for a thousand years, the

cultivation levels of the nine Great Creation cultivators all soared.

In the end, Han Jue appointed Han Zongdao, who cultivated the fastest, as the leader. He gave them the name Nine Divine Stars, and they would only serve him in the future. Han Jue began to cultivate in seclusion. Shan’e

left the Daoist temple with the Nine Divine

Stars and they started to get to know each other. The Nine Divine Stars all wanted to know Han Jue’s deeds. Shan’e didn’t hide anything from them and even mentioned the other mighty figures of the Han family.

The more Shan’e talked about them, the more

excited they became. The Nine Divine Stars also felt their blood boil. They all targeted Han Huang and also wanted to be invincible in the Chaos.

On the other side.

As more and more Chaotic factions joined the Transcendent Great Dao World, the Consciousnessless Great Dao World and the Shi Tian Great Dao World also began to imitate it.

For a time, the entire Chaos swayed. All living beings were worried that the Chaos would be

eaten.

At this moment, an Eternal Peak appeared and wanted to unify the Chaos.

It was the Eternal Peak of the second Chaotic

Assembly, Zhao Shuangquan!

Zhao Shuangquan left the Heavenly Dao and established the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy alone. He first absorbed countless geniuses and began to expand his domain. He used the excuse of resisting the three Great Dao Worlds

to unify them, causing countless experts to seek refuge.

The Ultimate God of Punishment did not stop

him, causing the Great Dao Divine Spirits to secretly wonder. The leader of the Divine Spirits had said that there was no need to unite the Chaos, so Zhao Shuangquan’s actions were

equivalent to a slap in the face. However, the Ultimate God of Punishment did

not say anything, and the Great Dao Divine Spirits did not dare to act recklessly. Zhao Shuangquan had already grown up and was also a Divine Punisher. His status surpassed most Great Dao Divine Spirits.

…

Ten million years passed quickly. Han Jue reached 160 million years old and obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen. The Chaotic Assembly was about to begin when the Chaos became chaotic again. The geniuses

of the other Great Dao Worlds would

participate this time. It was known as an unprecedented Chaotic Assembly. Its foundation and difficulties far exceeded previous ones.

Han Jue looked at the Nine Divine Stars meditating in front of him. They were all already Great Dao Sages. They had become Great Dao Sages in ten million years and were still considered top-notch in the current Chaos.
