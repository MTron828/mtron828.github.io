Chapter 1077 Legend Appears

Han Jue’s appearance excited all the nearby Hidden Sect disciples. The vast killing intent that enveloped the world seemed to have vanished.

The divine light on his body turned into the brightest light in everyone’s eyes. It represented hope and victory.

Han Jue was invincible in the hearts of the personal disciples of the Hidden Sect.

irreversible situations seemed calm in front of Han Jue. They no longer doubted him and only looked forward to it.

“Although you said it well, don’t repeat it next time. If you have the ability, rely on your strength to shoulder your responsibilities!”

Han Jue’s voice floated over, causing Jiang Jueshi and the others to lower their heads in shame.

Han Qing’er snorted. “That’s right. All of you are not strong enough and are still pretending to be strong. In the end, you still troubled my father. It’s better to escape back to the Dao Field with me.”

Facing her mockery, everyone was even more ashamed and did not even dare to reply.

Lao Dan looked at Han Jue and sighed.

Back then, he did not expect this person to grow into a transcendent existence that even his main body could not compare to. He would surpass the entire Chaos.

Han Jue looked into the distance and locked onto the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil fighting Zhao Shuangquan and his son. He was indeed very strong. An even stronger power hidden in his body was also constantly being released to increase his aura.

“You’re here.”

The Ultimate God of Punishment appeared

beside Han Jue with a low tone.

Han Jue didn’t look at him and only said softly,

“You can rest now.’

The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “I

suspect that this fellow has already surpassed the Great Dao Supreme Realm and reached a higher realm. You have to be careful.”

Han Jue didn’t reply.

He did not attack immediately. Instead, he

wanted to see Han Huang and Zhao

Shuangquan’s limits.

Han Tuo, Han Qing’er, and Han Yunjin

hurriedly came over.

“Father, hurry up and attack. I can’t hold on

much longer.”

“What are you waiting for?”

Han Jue was unmoved by his children’s urging.

More and more mighty figures noticed Han Jue’s appearance. His divine light blocked all prying eyes. Seeing how respectful the Ultimate God of Punishment was, the older generation could guess Han Jue’s identity and felt relieved.

The new mighty figures were curious. Who was this person?

At the same time.

In the third Dao Field.

“The progenitor has gone there!”

Shan’e was excited as if he was the one saving the situation.

The Nine Divine Stars were the same. They were extremely excited. All these years, they had often watched the Chaos, and they had experienced the simulation trial, so they had always looked forward to seeing who was stronger between the ancestor and the Ultimate

Evil Chaotic Devil.

Xing Hongxuan smiled. “That fellow is in

trouble.”

Xuan Qingjun, Fairy Xi Xuan, Qingluan’er, and Chang Yue’er all smiled and nodded.

Han Jue never fought battles that he had no

chance of winning. As long as he was willing to attack, the battle situation would definitely be

overwhelming.

Han Huang frantically mobilized the Ultimate

Origin Power, but it was directly scattered by the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil every time he wanted to use his Mystical Power. “Damn it… What Mystical Power is this?”

Han Huang was so angry that his eyes turned

red.

He couldn’t see the Ultimate Evil Chaotic

Devil’s moves at all.

He felt an extremely terrifying invisible force

suddenly hit him every time he stood up.

He was not the only one. Zhao Shuangquan was also extremely angry.

“Damn it, is this Ninth Brother’s power?”

Zhao Shuangquan was furious. Was this still the power given to him? Why was it so difficult

to subdue?

He couldn’t help but guess. Could it be that his ninth brother had a change of heart?

The two of them condensed their bodies again

and attacked the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil. The moment they moved, they were dispersed

by an invisible force and destroyed in the alternate space.

“You worms, do you still want to struggle?”

The voice of the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil sounded.

“You don’t know the meaning of the Chaos at

all. Your existence is only an accident. I will devour you and let you return to your original path!

“However, since you want to struggle, I’ll let you feel unprecedented despair!” The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s laughter echoed at the bottom of the Chaos, causing the

cultivators recuperating to be both angry and terrified.

Ten Absolute City had been flattened. Countless living beings had died, and they were all cultivators. They were equivalent to the backbone of the Chaos.

After this battle, it was unknown how long it would take for the Chaos to recover. Han Jue watched for a while and walked over.

He ascended to the sky step by step as if he was stepping on an invisible staircase.

All the nearby mighty figures heaved a sigh of

relief upon seeing that he had finally made a

move.

“Huang’er, leave.”

Just as Han Huang was about to continue, Han Jue’s voice stopped him from flying again. He

turned around and was stunned.

“Father…”

He did not expect his father to come. Because his father had not cared about the

Chaos for nearly 200 million years, he also understood that his father definitely had his own Great Dao World. Zhao Shuangquan also heard Han Jue’s voice and looked over.

He worshiped the Divine Might Heavenly Sage the most before recovering his origin memories.

Now that he had regained his memories, as the

Eighth Chaos, he was very curious about how strong this junior was.

The Ninth Chaos had instructed him that

among the current Dao Creators, only Han Jue could threaten him.

“Who are you?” the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil

asked in a low voice as he looked at Han Jue. Filled with killing intent, his red eyes pierced through the rolling mist and landed on Han

Jue.

The world was murky. Han Jue and the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s gazes collided.

All the living beings looked at Han Jue.

Evil

The scene seemed to freeze. Han Jue’s figure was not tall. Compared to the Ultimate Chaotic Devil, he was even more tiny.

Han Jue ignored the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil. He was getting closer and closer. The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil became anxious

and uneasy. He suddenly opened his mouth, and violent negative karma swept through the entire bottom of the Chaos like a black hurricane.

Han Jue still advanced. The violent negative

karma couldn’t even break through his Supreme Treasure protective shield. The mighty figures healing were not injured,

either. They were all protected by Han Jue’s Ultimate Origin Power. This surprised them. “Who is he?”

“It looks like the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!”

“Divine Might Heavenly Sage, the legendary

mighty figure who established the era of geniuses?”

“So powerful. Why haven’t I heard of him?” “Nonsense. You’re so powerful. Do all the mortals know you?”

…

Han Jue seemed to be walking slowly, but he

arrived in front of the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil in just a few steps.

The hurricane formed by negative karma exploded. The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil took a step back in fear when he saw clearly. With

his figure, this step brought him billions of

kilometers away.

“Who are you?”

The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil seemed to be

stimulated and roared crazily.

Boom-

The mist in the sky was washed away and a

black pillar of light descended from the sky, drowning Han Jue.

Roars of evil devils sounded in the pillar of

light. They gathered together and formed an ear-piercing and terrifying commotion. Soon, the roar turned into a wail. Red light appeared in the middle of the black

pillar of light and destroyed it. A huge Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal appeared and grew larger and larger, occupying the sky at the bottom of

the Chaos.

The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil had no choice

but to look up. “This move…”

Han Huang’s eyelids twitched as he thought of the previous simulation

trial.

Zhao Shuangquan was moved. He was shocked

as he looked at the endless Ultimate Origin

Heaven Seal.
