Chapter 915 Eight Quadrillion Dao Devils

“This fellow has already possessed my disciple, but he’s still calculating. How pretentious,” Han Jue thought disdainfully.

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit asked, “Who are your disciples?”.

Han Jue said, “Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi.”

As for Lao Dan, he did not mention him. After all, it was Lao Dan’s suggestion to go to the bottom of the Chaos. He couldn’t rule out a

trap.

Leave Lao Dan to Laozi.

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit chuckled. “I have some impression of these three. Their potential is indeed extraordinary. I’m afraid I can’t return them to you.”

Han Jue smiled and asked, “Fellow Daoist, you’re really willful.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He directly used the Dark Forbidden Zone and turned the dream into reality, quickly scanning the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s cultivation.

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit said meaningfully, “The dream has turned into reality. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is indeed impressive. It seems that if I want to flatten the Heavenly Dao, I have to eliminate you first.”

Han Jue had already activated all his Supreme Treasures. “Why must you deal with the Heavenly Dao? Every injustice has its perpetrator and every debt has its debtor. Can’t you look for the Dao Ancestor? Besides, the Heavenly Dao and the Ancient Desolate share the same origin. You’re equivalent to fighting among brothers.”

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was actually equivalent to a Heavenly Dao Divine Spirit, but it was separated.

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit smiled. “Fellow Daoist, you really know a lot. However, why are you so naive? Or are you pretending not to know? The Dao Ancestor has long fused with the Heavenly Dao. He didn’t disappear. He only transformed into the Heavenly Dao.”

The Dao Ancestor was in the Heavenly Dao?

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit smiled disdainfully. “Since you want to fight, let me see how powerful the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is!”

He suddenly raised his hand, and a black aura transformed into a fog that drowned Han Jue.

The fog was filled with terrifying negative karma and resentment. It was extremely cold. In a daze, it was as if there were billions of ghosts wailing and roaring.

Han Jue immediately used the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm. The power of his final essence poured out and transformed into a domineering palm force that destroyed all the surrounding fog.

He used the Great Dao of Traversal and the Great Dao of Space to quickly escape.

How fast was he?

“Divine Might Heavenly Sage, you are indeed very strong. However, it’s impossible for you to escape me. The Heavenly Dao will be flattened when I create eight quadrillion Dao Devils!”

The voice of the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit entered Han Jue’s ears. His tone was filled with joy, as if Han Jue was the Dao Ancestor and he was taking revenge.

[The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]

Han Jue ignored him and quickly returned to the Heavenly Dao. He jumped into the Hundred Peak Immortal River and went to the third Dao Field.

The reason why he took a detour was that he was afraid of harming the universe.

Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and heaved a sigh of relief.

It had to be said that the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was indeed powerful. It had given him a very dangerous feeling just now.

However, it was only a dangerous feeling!

The pressure did not turn into despair!

Han Jue began the simulation trial and challenged the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.

Five minutes later, he opened his eyes with an extremely solemn expression.

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was amazing!

Han Jue finally saw the Dao Devils. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s Dao Devil Mystical Power was similar to the three thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. It contained different Great Dao powers, but there were a thousand types. It was not as many as him.

In the end, Han Jue still successfully killed the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, but it took him five minutes to fight with all his might.

This was a simulation trial. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit attacked with all his might, only attacking and not retreating.

If it was in reality, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit could completely stall for time and hide if he couldn’t win. Once Han Jue was restrained and the eight quadrillion Dao Devils stepped into the Heavenly Dao, it would be like a wolf amidst a flock of sheep.

Han Jue had heard that there were also Great Dao Sages among the Dao Devils!

Who knew how many Great Dao Sages were hidden among the eight quadrillion Dao Devils?

Most importantly was the Ultimate God’s attitude.

Han Jue felt that the Ultimate God of Punishment was related to the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. He could guess from the previous conversation that what he had said to the Ultimate God had very likely been told to the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.

Han Jue continued the simulation trial and tried to find a way to insta-kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.

Several days later.

Han Jue stopped the simulation trial. It would take at least thirty breaths of time to kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.

Thirty breaths was too long!

Something would definitely happen in the meantime!

It would be bad if the Ultimate God of Punishment also joined in.

“I want to know how long until the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit attacks the Heavenly Dao?” Han Jue asked in his mind.

From the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s words, it would probably take some time.

As long as he had time, he could continue to become stronger.

[100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

[About 2.8 million years.]

It was neither long nor short.

Compared to the previous crises, 2.8 million years was too little time for a Great Dao Sage to improve, let alone a Great Dao Supreme.

But it was different to Han Jue.

He was the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial that surpassed all living beings by two bloodline levels!

He might be able to break through again in 2.8 million years. Han Jue perked up and his eyes flickered coldly.

Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, you’re dead!

Han Jue decided to use the Book of Misfortune to stall for time in the future.

In the depths of the Ancient Desolate, a huge palace sat at the bottom of the lake.

The Ultimate God of Punishment looked at the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit and asked, “Is it the Heavenly Dao’s Divine Might Heavenly Sage?”

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit said, “That’s right. He’s indeed very strong. As expected of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s potential. He’s even stronger than Pangu back then.”

The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “Of course. Even Pangu was stomped under the feet of a Divine Authority General. How can it compare to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?

“Are you really confident in dealing with him?”

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit stared at him and said, “Of course I’m confident. He’s indeed powerful, but he’s not my match.”

The Ultimate God of Punishment hesitated for a moment and then asked, “Can you let him live and create a great cause together?”

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was silent.

The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “If you want to break the old situation of the Chaos and reconstruct the rules, you and I alone might not be able to succeed. Didn’t you say that a mysterious existence above the Chaos is spying on it?

“We don’t even know what that is. It’s enough to show the difference between us. He might even control the power of the seven Supreme Divine Authorities. We can be more confident with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s help.”

He still had a good impression of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage and even felt that he could become his confidant.

The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit said faintly, “If you can persuade him, you can naturally do it. However, I will definitely make his cultivation go to ruin if he wants to defend the Heavenly Dao.”

The Ultimate God of Punishment fell silent.

Time passed quickly.

Another hundred thousand years passed.

The calamity of the Ancient Desolate did not spread in the Chaos. Only a few people knew.

Han Jue opened his eyes and felt the increase in his cultivation. He smiled in satisfaction.

It was difficult for the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit not to die with the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial’s talent!

Han Jue first checked his interpersonal relationships. He was relieved after confirming that the portraits of Dao Sovereign and the other two were still there.

Then, he sent a dream to the Ultimate God of Punishment.

A few years ago, the Ultimate God of Punishment had sent him a dream and he had ignored it since he was busy cultivating.

His principles could not be broken!

In the dream.

The Ultimate God of Punishment opened his eyes and sighed when he saw Han Jue.

What a domineering method. He actually did not sense it.

It would be too terrifying if such a method could kill the enemy.
