Chapter 906 Primordial Fiendcelestial Battles the Chaotic Fiendcelestials

“My big brother used to follow you?” Han Huang asked curiously. He had long heard of Han Tuo, but he had never seen him before.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled and nodded.

Han Huang shook his head. “Forget it. Although you treat me very well, you’re not strong. I don’t want to follow you. No one in this world is worth following other than my parents.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor was stunned.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s expression became subtle.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “It’s good to go out and broaden your horizons. Your father is busy with seclusion and doesn’t have the time to take care of you.”

Han Huang said, “I also want to enter seclusion. Cultivation is the foundation. I won’t go out if I don’t cultivate to be the strongest.”

The Evil Heavenly Emperor couldn’t help but look at Han Jue.

Han Jue smiled and said, “This is his own idea. I brought him to the Immortal World previously. He lost interest in a few days and wanted to go back.”

Han Huang nodded. “I’ve already mastered the Sage Sense and observed the Chaos. Although I don’t know everything, the Chaos doesn’t interest me for now.”

The father and son sat side by side, looking like brothers.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled helplessly. “Everyone has their own ambitions. I won’t force you. The next time I meet Han Tuo, I’ll definitely tell him to come back to see you.”

Han Huang smiled. He was indeed looking forward to meeting his brother.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked, “There’s an additional Sage position in the Heavenly Dao. Should we let Han Huang…”

Han Jue shook his head. “There’s no need. With his personality, it’s impossible for him to manage the Heavenly Dao. Let him stay by my side. As for the Sage position, you can arrange it yourself.”

Curious, Han Huang asked, “What is the Sage position?”

“It’s none of your business,” Han Jue replied casually.

Then, the Evil Heavenly Emperor pulled Han Huang to the side as if he was an elder concerned about a junior. He asked about his father’s well-being while Han Jue and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du talked about the Heavenly Dao.

Now that the Chaos was peaceful, the Heavenly Dao could develop freely. The Immortal World was only so big. The number of things that could be interfered with by Sages was limited, so after new Sages appeared, they were all responsible for opening a Chaotic Heavenly Road.

There were already fifteen Chaotic Heavenly Roads that led to all directions of the Chaos. Because the Chaotic Heavenly Road could protect living beings below the Sage Realm, more and more Chaotic living beings joined the Heavenly Dao. This was something that the Three Pure Sacred World could not compare to.

The Three Pure Sacred World had also opened the Three Pure Heavenly Road. Unfortunately, the rules were not stable. They would be rejected by the Chaos if they were too strong. They would also be easily shattered and become a joke if they were too weak. The current situation was that as long as the two sides did not fight, the Heavenly Dao would sooner or later surpass the Three Pure Sacred World. This was already the consensus of the Chaos.

Han Jue was satisfied with Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s conclusion.

He praised, “The Heavenly Dao is truly fortunate to have the Heavenly Venerate. Come to my Dao Field if you have the time in the future. I will preach the Dao for you and help you embark on the Great Dao as soon as possible.”

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly thanked him.

His contact with Laozi had decreased ever since he had chosen the Heavenly Dao. As for being taught again, that was almost impossible. He was also too embarrassed to mention it.

Several hours later, Han Jue, Han Huang, and the Evil Heavenly Emperor walked out of the Universal Hall.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at Han Huang and smiled dotingly. “Don’t forget our agreement.”

Han Huang waved his hand and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll be the first to find you if I go to the Chaos!”

He looked so heroic that Han Jue wanted to laugh.

The Evil Heavenly Emperor left after exchanging some pleasantries. Han Jue then brought Han Huang back to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.

He thought for a moment and then brought him to the second Dao Field.

Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword were still cultivating in the Daoist temple. Sensing Han Huang’s aura, they immediately opened their eyes.

Their eyes lit up and they immediately stood

up.

“Wow, is this your second son?”

Dao Comprehension Sword approached Han Huang, scaring him away.

Han Jue smiled. “That’s right. His name is Han Huang. Huang’er, these two are your third and fourth mothers.”

Fourth Mother?

Dao Comprehension Sword’s face instantly turned red.

Han Huang bowed. Although he was proud, he was still very polite to his own family.

Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword had already learned of Han Huang’s potential in the Myriad Worlds Projection. They were not the only ones. The personal disciples were the same.

They had long wanted to see him. They were naturally happy to see him today. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

After a conversation, Han Huang also began to call them Third Mother and Fourth Mother.

Then, the four of them walked out of the Daoist temple.

Han Jue gathered all the Fiendcelestials.

Currently, there were 51 Chaotic Fiendcelestials in the second Dao Field. There was also one being nurtured in the Primordial World.

The scene was spectacular after the Fiendcelestials gathered.

Han Huang narrowed his eyes and sized them up. “Is this the Second Young Master? He does look like Master.”

The Black Hell Chicken was the first to smile. However, the others felt inexplicably uncomfortable. This feeling was very strange, as if they had encountered their natural enemy, especially Han Huang’s gaze.

Han Jue saw through everyone’s thoughts, so he said, “Yes, he’s my second son, Han Huang. He was born as Freedom and has a special bloodline. Your bloodlines have already been raised to the top level of the Chaos. It’s easy for you to be hostile to each other, but this is only a conflict between bloodlines, so I’m letting you know in advance. In the future, you still have to support each other on the path of cultivation.”

The Fiendcelestials immediately felt relieved and nodded upon hearing this.

That was indeed the case. Not to mention Han Huang, they already disliked each other. Fortunately, they had interacted for a long time before completely integrating. This was also the main reason why the three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials fought.

Murong Qi took a step forward and smiled. “Grandmaster, why don’t you let him stay with us for a period of time?”

The other Fiendcelestials hooted.

Han Jue said, “That’s my intention.”

With that, Han Jue turned around and returned to the Daoist temple, leaving Han Huang surrounded by everyone.

Guan Bubai stared at Han Huang and said, “Junior, you’re very strong. Shall we spar?”

Han Huang glanced at him and shook his head. Then, he walked in front of the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial and said, “You’re the strongest. Let’s spar!”

This scene surprised everyone. The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial was indeed the strongest. He had been suppressed by Murong Qi in the past and had only recently surpassed

him.

Guan Bubai curled his lips and looked unhappy, but he did not dare to refute. He had always been tortured by the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial and was already a younger brother.

Only he was stubborn in the second Dao Field. He dared to keep fighting the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial. As they fought, he developed feelings.

“Alright!”

The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial agreed readily. The two of them directly entered the simulation trial and began sparring

The current Han Huang was no longer the youth who had been tortured by Jiang Jueshi. In the past thousands of years, other than his cultivation, his combat talent had also been completely awakened with the help of the simulation trial.

Several dozen breaths later.

The simulation ended.

The two of them opened their eyes and frowned.

Guan Bubai smiled. “How about it? Little Junior Brother, you should spar with me.”

Han Huang ignored him and stared at the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial. “You’re very strong, stronger than Jiang Jueshi.” The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial took a deep breath and said, “I’m not your match.”

Everyone was shocked.

The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial was defeated?

“Oh my god, what kind of pervert has Master given birth to! He isn’t even ten thousand years old yet, right?” the Black Hell Chicken shouted, expressing everyone’s thoughts.
