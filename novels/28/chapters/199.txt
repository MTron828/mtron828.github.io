Chapter 201 Heavenly Court’s Foundation, Attack of a Powerful Enemy

Han Jue couldn’t help but look at the figure in front of Zhang Guxing. It was a silver shadow that couldn’t be seen clearly.

However, Han Jue was a Reincarnation Mystic Immortal. With a sweep of his divine sense, he could see this person’s appearance.

He was dressed in red and had a sword at his waist. He was handsome, with conceit between his eyebrows. He was also sizing up Han Jue. A late-stage Grand Unity True Immortal Realm expert of merely three thousand years old?

His potential was indeed impressive.

Han Jue praised him in his heart. He cupped his fists and said, “I’m Han Jue. Greetings, fellow Daoist.”

The silver figure cupped his hands. “Divine Palace, Zhu Jian.” Zhu Jian?

What a good name!

Han Jue didn’t know what to say. The other party clearly had no feelings for him.

Zhang Guxing asked with a smile, “The Heavenly Peach Banquet is about to begin. With your aptitude, won’t the Heavenly Court invite you?”

Han Jue said, “I’m afraid of trouble and can’t be bothered to go. It’s better to stay at home and cultivate.”

Zhu Jian smiled and said, “Indeed. In this Heavenly Peach Banquet, my Divine Palace’s Sword God Emperor will definitely be in the limelight. No one from the Heavenly Court should be able to defeat him.”

Really!

This Heavenly Peach Banquet looked like a grand event, but the Divine Palace wanted to take the opportunity to show off.

Han Jue wasn’t too worried.

If the Heavenly Emperor dared to invite the Divine Palace, he definitely had the confidence.

“Senior, I’ll be leaving first.”

Zhu Jian bowed to Zhang Guxing and left.

From this attitude, it seemed that Zhang Guxing’s status in the Divine Palace was very high. Even if he left, he would still be respected by the geniuses of the palace.

Han Jue thought.

He didn’t dislike Zhu Jian’s attitude and felt that it was normal.

Since he wasn’t interested in making friends, so be it. He didn’t offend Han Jue, anyway. After Zhu Jian disappeared, Zhang Guxing smiled and said, “The youngsters of the Divine Palace are like you. They cultivate all year round and are not good at socializing.”

Han Jue nodded and smiled. “Don’t worry. I’m not that calculative.”

He changed the topic and asked, “Senior, do you know the relationship between Heavenly Emperor and the Divine General?”

“You came into contact with them so quickly? There are indeed rumors that the Heavenly Emperor and the Divine General are not on good terms. The Divine General thinks highly of himself. After he grew up, he was dissatisfied with the many decisions made by the Heavenly Emperor. In addition, he achieved great feats and overshadowed his master, so that attracted the guesses of various factions. Of course, these are all rumors. The Divine General still belongs to the Heavenly Court.

“If you really join the Heavenly Court, don’t try to guess their relationship. Only they know whether they are on good terms or not. The only thing that can be certain is that the Divine General only listens to the Heavenly Emperor.”

Han Jue nodded. He felt the same.

The mind of an emperor could not be guessed.

The two of them chatted for a while more before Han Jue bid farewell and left.

In the following year, he came several times.

Zhang Guxing couldn’t help but sigh.

Who was the guardian of the Sword Dao River?

Why did it feel like Han Jue already treated this place as his home?

After spending a year raising his Sword Dao to the extreme, Han Jue was satisfied. He discovered that he couldn’t make the Heavenly Sword Dao any stronger.

This Sword Dao was already at the limit. Han Jue couldn’t imagine how strong the person who created it was.

Han Jue took out a heavenly peach and ate it.

The fruit melted the moment it entered his mouth, turning into boundless Immortal Qi. Han Jue immediately circulated his energy to refine it.

Several days later, the heavenly peach was digested.

Han Jue’s Dharmic powers increased greatly, surpassing decades of bitter cultivation. His lifespan also increased by ten thousand years.

However, he was still far from the mid-stage of the Reincarnation Mystic Immortal Realm.

The difficulty of breaking through in the Mystic Immortal Realm was dozens of times higher than that of a True Immortal!

It seemed that the heavenly peaches weren’t very helpful to Mystic Immortals. This was normal. If the power of the heavenly peach was limitless, the Heavenly Emperor would be able to produce Immortal Emperors or even Zenith Heavens with the peaches.

Han Jue decided to keep the remaining three peaches for now. What if they had some use later?

He picked up the remaining peach core and let Dao Comprehension Sword bury it under the Fusang Tree.

What if he could plant a Heavenly Peach Tree?

One had to have dreams!

It was fine even if it didn’t succeed. Dao Comprehension Sword did as told. He continued to cultivate.

Ten years later.

Han Jue stopped cultivating and took out the Book of Misfortune to curse his enemies.

While cursing, he checked his emails.

(Your good friend Zhou Fan was attacked by a mighty figure. He used a spatial mystical power to dodge and accidentally left the mortal world.]

(Your grand-disciple Murong Qi was attacked by demon beasts] X289004

(Your enemy Black Fox Demon Emperor was attacked by your grand-disciple Murong Qi. He was severely injured and his life was hanging by a thread.)

(Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by your good friend the Sword God Emperor and was severely injured.)

(Your good friend the Sword God Emperor was attacked by an Immortal God] x67

(Your good friend Sword God Emperor was attacked by an Immortal God and was severely injured.)

(Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck. Daoist Dan Qing’s lifespan has decreased by ten thousand years. The chances of the Dragon Immortal Island encountering a Heavenly Tribulation have increased.]

Along the way, they were all severely injured.

How dangerous! Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the Sword God Emperor was severely injured.

This meant that Heavenly Court wasn’t suppressed by the Divine Palace.

He didn’t want the Heavenly Court to be crushed by the Divine Palace at this juncture.

On second thought, Han Jue felt that his fear was ridiculous.

This was the Heavenly Court!

Before he joined, Heavenly Court was a huge mountain that made him feel suffocated.

After joining, he was worried about it.

This was a little like the logic in novels where enemies factions always seemed overpowered but quickly weakened once they were on your side.

Only by becoming an enemy could he understand how powerful the other party was. “Who injured the Sword God Emperor?”

Han Jue was very curious. The email didn’t indicate who it was, which meant that the person didn’t have any contact with him. And it wasn’t the Divine General.

The Heavenly Court was truly filled with hidden talents.

Han Jue continued cursing as he thought.

Two years later.

Han Jue suddenly opened his eyes.

He looked up and saw a figure appear in the void above the Scarlet Cloud World.

This person was a thousand feet tall, standing on a thousand-foot-long flood dragon. He wore a black robe and crossed his arms in front of his chest, looking down at the Scarlet Cloud World.

Han Jue frowned. Who was this person?

The black-robed man slowly raised his right hand. A long sword wrapped in blood aura appeared in his palm. He held the hilt.

Oh no!

Han Jue immediately moved out of the Connate Cave Abode and arrived above the Scarlet Cloud World.

When the black-robed man waved his sword, Han Jue also drew his sword and slashed at the

sky.

Heavenly Sword Dao!

Sword Pierces Heaven!

The black sword Qi soared and collided with the black-robed man’s sword Qi.

Boom!

The sword Qi exploded and swept in all directions. Han Jue and the black-robed man’s robes fluttered from the wind.

The black-robed man looked at him in surprise.

“A mere mortal world actually has a Mystic Immortal!”

The black-robed man thought to himself. His eyes turned ruthless as he brandished his sword again.

Han Jue was annoyed.

Courting death!

Without another word, he raised the Primordial Judgment Sword and executed Three Pure World Cleansing.

Nine sword Qi seas appeared in front of him. They were all vertical, like nine huge disks facing the black-robed man. Countless sword shadows condensed.

The black-robed man was surprised and immediately used his Mystical Power. The flood dragon beneath his feet transformed into a sinister-looking pagoda that covered him. Three Pure World Cleansing-Nine Heavens erupted again! Every sword Qi sea shot out ten million sword shadows!

Nearly a hundred million sword shadows shot out!

Han Jue didn’t hold back as his Six Paths Dharmic powers poured out.

When the sword shadows grew larger and larger in the black-robed man’s eyes, he screamed inside, “Oh no!”
