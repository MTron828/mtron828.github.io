Chapter 243 Dijun, Eastern Emperor Tai Yi

“What good news?” Han Jue asked.

Was he going to invite him out again?

Han Jue was conflicted. He didn’t want to take the risk.

Jiang Yi said with a burning gaze, “Recently, a legend has been spreading in the Immortal World. Legend has it that the Divine Treasure of the Dao Sect fell from the 33 Heavens and was lost in the mortal world. Whoever obtains this treasure can step into the Deity Realm!”

Deity Realm!

Immortal Emperors were top-notch experts in the Immortal World, but Deities were existences that couldn’t be touched.

Having just stepped into the Emperor Realm, Jiang Yi still yearned to reach a higher realm.

Han Jue smiled teasingly. “There’s only one treasure. How can we split it?”.

Jiang Yi shook his head and said, “Who said that there’s only one? Even if there’s only one, who said that only one person can use it?”

“If you help me find this treasure, I’ll help you reach the Emperor Realm.

“Your cultivation should have stopped advancing. You can only continue to become stronger when you reach the Emperor Realm.”

Han Jue asked curiously, “Will no one’s cultivation level increase after reaching the perfected Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm?”

His cultivation had always been growing stronger as if there was no end to it. He had found it strange before.

Jiang Yi said, “Of course. You’ve already reached the limits of a mortal. How can your cultivation level increase? Unless you’re… Forget it, there’s no point in saying it.”

“Tell me, did you write novels in the past?” Han Jue asked anxiously.

Damn it, why did he stop halfway! Jiang Yi asked in surprise, “What’s a novel?”

“It’s not important. Hurry up and tell me!”

“Unless you’re a Connate lifeform. Legend has it that before the Divine Investiture Calamity, the Immortal World was even vaster and boundless. It was a period without rules and immortals. After the Divine Investiture Calamity, the Connate lifeforms were almost extinct. The Heavenly Dao became more and more perfect, and there were also many difficulties in cultivation.

“The founder of our Golden Crow Divine Clan is a Connate lifeform.”

I see.

According to ancient mythologies, the older, the stronger.

The Stellar Primordial Body was definitely stronger than Connate lifeforms.

In other words, endless cultivation improvement was a good thing.

The stronger one’s talent was, the greater the accumulation required for each cultivation realm. One had to make ample preparations!

Talent was never just a matter of cultivation speed!

“Tell me quickly, what is a novel?” Jiang Yi asked.

Han Jue replied, “It’s a story.”

Jiang Yi asked in surprise, “I don’t write stories. Very few people in the Immortal World write stories.”

“Yes, then it’s fine.”

“So you agreed?”

“Thank you for your kind intentions. Sorry, I don’t want to go,” Han Jue said apologetically. The Deity Realm was indeed attractive, but he didn’t want to participate.

Jiang Yi frowned.

Han Jue rejected him again!

This was the second time he had been rejected!

He couldn’t take it!

He was the invincible prodigy of the Golden Crow Divine Clan. Who dared to not give him face?

Jiang Yi snorted. “Sima Yi, don’t you think too highly of yourself? I treated you sincerely, but you rejected me one time after another. Could it be that you look down on me?”

Han Jue waved his hand and said, “How can that be? It’s my fortune to befriend you, Jiang Yi. It’s just that I’m timid and afraid of death. I don’t want to take the risk. Otherwise, why would I hide here and be a tiny mortal world guardian? Even the Heavenly Emperor invited me to ascend, but I’ve rejected him many times. I really don’t want to take the risk. I just want to cultivate in peace.”

Hearing this, Jiang Yi frowned and stared at him coldly.

Han Jue was nervous. Was this fellow going to attack?

He wondered if he could withstand it.

Should he admit defeat?

No way. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

If he admitted defeat, his life would be over. He would be Jiang Yi’s dog in the future.

Wait!

What am I afraid of?

I have a Heavenly Emperor above me!

This was Heavenly Court’s territory!

Many thoughts flashed through Han Jue’s mind, and he became more confident. “You can reject me. Then, tell me a novel. If it can satisfy me, I’ll leave. I heard that many storytellers in the mortal world tell stories about immortals.” Jiang Yi suddenly smiled.

Han Jue showed a frown.

Tell a story? This was fine, too. At least, they could avoid conflict.

Han Jue immediately meditated, and Jiang Yi sat down.

After hesitating for a while, Han Jue decided to tell the story of the Golden Crow.

“Legend has it that when the world first opened, all things were in chaos. All living beings were muddle-headed. In the distant sun, two Golden Crows were born. One was called Eastern Emperor Tai Yi, and the other was called Dijun…”

Han Jue started to tell the story. This was a Primordial World novel he had read in his previous life.

Jiang Yi was expressionless. Han Jue didn’t notice his hands trembling in his sleeves.

“That era was called the Primordial World. After the Eastern Emperor Tai Yi and Dijun completed their cultivation, they left the Sun and came to the Primordial World. They used their absolute strength to unite all living beings on the ground and called them the Demon Race…”

Han Jue became more and more excited as he spoke. He wasn’t afraid of offending anyone. Even if the Eastern Emperor Tai Yi and Dijun really existed, they were already gone.

Even Hao Tian and the twelve Ancestral Magi were gone. How could these two Supreme Demons still be alive?

He had previously asked Di Taibai if he knew anything about the Primordial World. Di Taibai had replied that he did not.

Perhaps the history of the Immortal World was different from the Chinese legends, but it was definitely not the same.

Jiang Yi was soon entranced.

The more Han Jue spoke, the more excited he became. Anyway, he was bragging about how impressive Eastern Emperor Tai Yi and Dijun were.

To avoid suspicion, he didn’t mention the Heavenly Court.

In the legends, the ones who created the Heavenly Court were the Dijun and the Eastern Emperor. After the battle with the Magi, they perished together with the twelve Ancestral Magi. The Dao Ancestor reorganized the Heavenly Court and named Hao Tian the Heavenly Emperor, who later became the Jade Emperor.

Of course, that was only a legend of the Primordial World. It had nothing to do with this world.

Han Jue only finished after several hours.

Jiang Yi sighed. “Truly amazing Demon Emperors! They dared to fight with Heaven and the Sages. Even if they died, they fought to the end!”

Han Jue said, “They’re indeed very heroic, but they went against the Heavenly Dao. They created too many sins and couldn’t reverse the situation.”

These words were to please the Sages.

Sages were supreme and might not care about the mortal world, but Han Jue was afraid of what might happen.

Jiang Yi nodded. He wasn’t a bloodthirsty person.

Han Jue asked, “Are you satisfied?”

Hearing this, Jiang Yi said meaningfully, “I’m satisfied. Sima Yi, you’re not simple. No wonder the Heavenly Emperor protected you.” Then, he stood up and looked down at him.

“Your talent is not bad, but you’re timid by nature and can’t achieve great things. You can hide for a while, but you can’t hide forever. One day, you’ll have no choice but to come out. At that time, the people you left behind might have already begun to look down on you. As for me, I might have already forgotten about you.

“I’ll be the Eastern Emperor Tai Yi in your story, and no one in the future will know

you.”

With that, Jiang Yi vanished.

Han Jue cursed silently.

How pretentious.

So what if you’re the Eastern Emperor Tai Yi? Go and die like him!

I’m nameless, but I can live forever!

In the Primordial World, Dao Ancestor Hong Jun had always been cultivating in a low profile manner. After he survived the First Calamity, he became the strongest in the Primordial World.

That was Han Jue’s goal. He didn’t want fame because he wanted to live longer.

After he became the strongest, he would also want fame!

Han Jue stopped thinking and returned to the Connate Cave Abode.

At this moment, Divine Lord Wu De slowly appeared.

“The story is indeed interesting, but why did he only talk about the Demon Court and not about our Heavenly Court? This child’s awareness is not high!” Divine Lord Wu De muttered to himself.
