Chapter 1020 The Pride of a Born Emperor

(Your grand-disciple Han Yao received guidance from your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor and learned a Mystical Power.]

(Your son Han Huang has entered the Transcendent Great Dao World.]

(Your good friend, the Ultimate God of Punishment, has entered the Transcendent Great Dao World.)

[Your good friend Azure Heaven Mystic has comprehended a Great Dao Mystical Power. His providence has increased greatly.]

[Your son Han Tuo was cursed by a mysterious curse.]

[Your disciple Jiang Jueshi created a Mystical Power. Millions of clones fell into the cycle of reincarnation.]

(Your good friend Pangu has entered the Transcendent Great Dao World.)

Transcendent Great Dao World?

Han Jue frowned. Wasn’t the Formless Transcendent Deity suppressed? Why was the Great Dao World exposed?

There had to be a scheme!

The Number One Deity had been suppressed by the Great Dao Divine Spirits ever since the Chaotic Assembly ended, and the Consciousnessless Great Dao World had begun to be invaded by the various Chaotic forces. The Consciousnessless Great Dao World had already been tainted by the providence of the Chaos and was on the verge of fusing after more than twenty million years of development.

Could it be that the Ninth Chaos wanted to fuse with their Great Dao World while the two Dao Creators were suppressed?

Hiss!

If his guess was correct, then the Ninth Chaos was too ruthless. This move might cause the two Dao Creator’s cultivation to fall a major realm!

Han Jue couldn’t expose the Ultimate Origin World to avoid being targeted by the Ninth Chaos.

He was also very interested in the Transcendent Great Dao World. Therefore, he created a clone and went to investigate it.

As for his main body, it was better to stay in the Dao Field.

“Father, what are you thinking?”

Han Ling’s voice floated over, her tone a little excited.

Han Jue glanced at her and knew what she was thinking. “Come.”

The father and daughter entered the simulation trial and opened their eyes the next second.

Han Ling sighed.

It still did not work.

She looked up again and said, “Father, stand still and let me fight. Try my Mystical Power.”

Han Jue had no choice but to agree.

An hour later.

The simulation ended.

Han Ling sighed. “Father, you’re really powerful. Even though my ten million Emperor Soldiers can gather into a formation, they can’t break through your robe’s restriction.”

Han Jue smiled. “Nonsense. I’m your father.”

Han Ling curled her lips and said, “Father, do you think I can obtain the Eternal Peak if I participate in the Chaotic Assembly?”

“Oh? You want to?”

“I deduced that Han Ye and Han Yao are also determined to participate, so I’m hesitating if I should accompany them.”

Han Jue rolled his eyes. Was this how a woman should be?

He had discovered that Han Ling was unhappy with Han Yao and Han Ye. He did not expect this girl to actually want to participate in the Chaotic Assembly to stop them.

Han Ling covered her mouth and laughed. “Father, I’m teasing you. I know that you cherish those two brats. Why would I suppress them?”

Han Jue smiled. “You’re also their ancestor. Don’t treat them as peers. They can also help you if they can grow up and you have great ambitions in the future.”

The Primordial Emperor Star was born as an Emperor!

Han Jue wouldn’t be deceived by Han Ling’s appearance. This girl looked obedient, but arrogance always existed in her heart. It was actually very easy to guess Han Ling’s thoughts. Why did she always challenge Han Jue? It was because she used him as a standard. She would be able to rule the Chaos as long as she defeated him.

Han Ling couldn’t help but think when she heard that.

Han Jue continued to read the emails. How many emails had he accumulated in five million years? Every email was equivalent to a fragment of one’s life. It could be an opportunity or a calamity.

Han Ling was still thinking after he finished reading the emails. He stood up and went to visit his Dao Companions.

Several decades later.

In the second Dao Field.

Han Jue sat opposite dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials and was discussing the Dao.

After so many years, all the Chaotic Fiendcelestials had already become Great Dao Sages. More than half had reached the Great Dao Supreme Realm. Their potential coupled with the Spirit Qi of the second Dao Field was so terrifying

Murong Qi said, “Grandmaster, recently, a world has been created in the depths of my soul. This world is closely related to my cultivation. Why is that?”

He had seen the power of the world at the Chaotic Assembly. It was indeed powerful, but at that time, he thought it was a Mystical Power. Only when he cultivated a world did he realize that this was a realm.

Han Jue said, “You have to create a world if you want to go beyond the Great Dao Supreme Realm. Previously, the place where the Ten Absolutes of the Chaos fought was the Consciousnessless Great Dao World. It was a world made by a transcendent existence.”

Great Loose Heaven was moved. “In that case, could it be that the Chaos is also…”

Han Jue smiled and nodded.

He didn’t have to worry about being spied on by the Ninth Chaos in the second Dao Field.

Regarding the Great Dao World’s secrets, Han Jue also planned to use this opportunity to tell his personal disciples in front of him. They were all trusted aides. The Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s potential was too strong. If not for him leading the way, he could only reach this step in his seclusion.

Han Jue explained his understanding of the Great Dao World, causing the dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials to fall into deep thought.

After a long while…

Dao Comprehension Sword asked curiously, “Master, what about your Great Dao World?”

Han Jue smiled and didn’t say anything.

The Black Hell Chicken shouted, “Don’t ask nonsense. If you ask, the answer is no. It’s the same for the others. How vast is the Consciousnessless Great Dao World? It’s even suppressed under the Chaos. This means that the Lord of Chaos is petty. Once he discovers…”

The Fiendcelestials were moved, and Dao Comprehension Sword’s face turned pale.

Han Jue said, “You have to be careful when you travel the Chaos in the future. With your cultivation levels, you seem to be above all living beings, but you should be able to sense that this Chaos is still very unfamiliar. The higher you stand, the more you should understand. Many rules and existences are unimaginable, and behind this unimaginable existence is a transcendent existence that far exceeds us.”

The Fiendcelestials nodded.

Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial said, “We won’t go out. We’ll stay in each other’s Great Dao World and not cause trouble for Master if we’re bored in the future.”

The other Fiendcelestials agreed, making Han Jue very satisfied.

They needed an extremely long time to cultivate a Great Dao World.

Several years later.

Han Jue returned to the third Dao Field and prepared to continue cultivating.

He suddenly thought of Hong Jun in the universe of stars.

He focused his gaze and saw that Hong Jun was no longer in the universe of stars. However, Liu Bei was still there.

He began to deduce Hong Jun and discovered that he had left after attaining Freedom. Now, he was preaching the Dao in a corner of the Chaos and spreading his teachings.

It seemed like he was preparing for the Dao Ancestor’s return.

Han Jue clicked his tongue in wonder. What did the Dao Ancestor want?

Why hadn’t he appeared now that the Heavenly Dao and the Chaos were peaceful?

It seemed that the Dao Ancestor had also established his own Great Dao World and was very powerful. Was he afraid of being discovered by the Ninth Chaos?

[The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit sent you a dream. Do you accept?]

A notification suddenly appeared in front of him, making Han Jue frown.

Wasn’t the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit already demoted to the mortal world by the Ninth Chaos? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

How could he send a dream?

Could it be that after more than twenty million years, this fellow had already grown

up?

Han Jue hesitated for a moment before choosing to accept the dream.

The dream was a blank domain. Han Jue saw the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit covered in the divine light of the Supreme Rules.

When enemies met, they fell silent.

A moment later, the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit said, “It’s time for the Primordial Fiendcelestial to appear!”
