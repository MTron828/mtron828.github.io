Chapter 1101 Transcendent

Breakthrough! Supreme

Existence!

What do you want to do after becoming a Creator Lord?

Han Jue wasn’t confused by his Dao heart’s question.

From the beginning to the end, he was very determined.

“I won’t especially do anything. Instead, I’ll do whatever I want. Since I’m invincible, why set up rules for myself?” Han Jue replied. The other him nodded in satisfaction.

A true invincible person should be unrestrained. There were no rules, strength, morals, or other restrictions.

The other asked, “Will you continue cultivating?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Yes, I will constantly climb higher and higher. I won’t consolidate my status by suppressing the juniors.”

Han Jue smiled confidently. He would be numb sooner or later as long as he lost his ambition.

During the Primordial Era, had anyone ever thought that several Dao Creators would appear?

The other him, which was formed by his Dao heart, dissipated like smoke, leaving only a

sentence.

“The Creator Lord Realm is ahead. I wish you success.”

In the blank domain.

Various gaseous substances of different colors moved faster.

Han Jue could suddenly spy on the Chaos. Time passed extremely quickly in the Chaos! A second here was a million years outside!

Han Jue saw Han Huang attack and shock the Chaos, bringing despair to it. Then, he sent out Primordial Despair and slaughtered wantonly. Seeing that the Chaos was about to be defeated, the Ninth Chaos made a move. Other than Zhao Shuangquan and Yu Yuan, six more Chaos revived. In addition to his clone, the nine Chaos attacked together to suppress the Primordial Chaos.

At the critical moment, Primordial Origin attacked to reinforce Han Huang. The two Primordial Fiendcelestials joined forces to resist the nine Chaos.

The Ninth Chaos couldn’t withstand the

pressure and began to personally interfere with the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.

Han Jue frowned.

It wasn’t easy for him to obtain such comprehension. If he was distracted and interfered, this special Dao comprehension state would be destroyed. In other words, he would miss this opportunity to break through.

Could this be one of the tests?

Han Jue’s eyes became firm.

He had to become a Creator Lord!

No one could interfere and burden him!

The Ninth Chaos could revive all living beings

in the Chaos. Why couldn’t he revive his children and disciples if he became a Creator Lord?

Han Jue severed his perception of the Chaos and stepped forward to comprehend the true meaning of the blank domain.

Han Huang would definitely die in this Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity without his help. Not only Han Huang, but also the personal disciples who supported him.

However, Han Jue couldn’t give up the chance to become the Creator Lord for his children

and disciples.

His mind had been firm and selfish ever since

he was weak.

He would only help those close to him if he could. If he could not, he would only care

about himself.

Han Jue had a clear conscience as he looked at

everyone around him. He didn’t owe anyone

anything!

Including his wife and children.

If not for him, how could they reach this

level!

“I’ll revive you all when I become a Creator

Lord!”

Han Jue’s eyes became arrogant and

confident.

He would definitely become a Creator Lord!

As this arrogance rose, the Qi-shaped substances along the way surged towards

him, forging his body. His body dissipated, leaving only his soul to advance.

All sorts of lights overflowed from his soul,

dazzling. He could clearly feel his soul transforming.

He felt a power that was higher than the Supreme Rules of the Great Dao World. This feeling was extremely strange.

After walking for an unknown period of time,

Han Jue’s soul strength reached the extreme. This was unprecedentedly powerful, making him excited.

His soul stopped when it couldn’t take it

anymore.

There were still densely packed Qi-shaped substances ahead. They were still so dazzling, as if he had never stepped forward.

Han Jue raised his right palm and muttered, “The Creator Lord controls everything. Nothing can stop him. In that case, I’ll see if

my strength is enough.”

Boom-

He struck out with his palm. It was the Divine

Might Great Heaven Palm!

The extreme destructive power directly shattered everything in front of him. This blank domain shattered like a mirror. Absolute paleness entered his vision again.

He shattered the rules of the blank domain

with a palm!

At this moment, Han Jue had already surpassed the Creator Lord.

His body condensed again and began to fuse

with his soul. The Ultimate Origin Power began to transform.

A pillar of light shot out from his body. There

was no end to it above or below, as if it was

splitting the blank domain into two!

His aura soared with unstoppable force! Han Jue was immersed.

A figure appeared near him at this moment.

It was the Ninth Chaos. “You… how is that possible…” the Ninth Chaos shouted in shock.

Han Jue felt that he was too noisy. With a

glance, he destroyed the Ninth Chaos’ body and soul. Even the remaining Transcendent Rule Insignia in every corner of the blank domain

perished.

In other words, the Ninth Chaos had directly

perished! Just a glance!

He couldn’t resist at all!

This glance used the power of the rules of the

blank domain, so the Ninth Chaos Transcendent Rule hidden in every corner of the blank domain had nowhere to hide and

thus died.

The difference between a Dao Creator and a Creator Lord was immediately revealed.

Han Jue was calm and continued to enjoy the breakthrough.

Not long after, the Formless Transcendent Deity and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity appeared.

They looked at Han Jue in shock.

He didn’t attack these two subordinates. The Formless Transcendent Deity said helplessly, “Why didn’t you appear earlier… Back then, the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity…’

||

Han Jue already knew that even though he

seemed to have broken through very quickly,

a long time had actually passed. The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity had already ended for a long time, so long that all

living beings in the Endless Era had already forgotten the Chaos.

The Chaos had already become a legend.

Apart from his wives and children who stayed

in Han Jue’s Dao Field, Han Huang, Ji Xianshen, Murong Qi, and the others had all died in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Han Ling, Han Ye, Han Yao, and Han Bashen

survived because they supported the Chaos. All of this was very similar to the future that

Han Jue had deduced.

Han Jue indifferently said, “There’s still time. You can leave.”

The Formless Transcendent Deity and the

Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity looked at each other in confusion.

Could it be that Han Jue wanted to reverse space-time?

However, this was the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. It was independent

of space and time. The supreme karma could

not be reversed.

Although they were puzzled, they had no choice but to leave.

Han Jue grew quiet again and began to consolidate his cultivation in peace.

This time, it took much longer to consolidate

his cultivation.

Another person arrived after an unknown period of time.

It was Han Ling.

She emitted endless divine light. She was even

more holy than the former Holy Mother of Order.

She looked at Han Jue and said respectfully, “Father, you’re indeed still here.”

The pillar of light on Han Jue’s body was extremely dazzling. That terrifying power made Han Ling instinctively afraid. She was shocked.

How strong was her father?

Han Jue glanced at her and said, “It’s been

hard on you all these years.”

“Father…’

||

All sorts of emotions surged into Han Ling’s

heart, making her feel a long-awaited

grievance.

She wanted to say something else, but she left

silently upon seeing that Han Jue was busy breaking through.

Too many things had happened, pulling her away from her father.

Han Jue understood her but didn’t say

anything.

He could turn everything into an illusion and reconstruct the past when he successfully

broke through.
