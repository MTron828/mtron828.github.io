Chapter 828 Fiendcelestial Calamity

Han Jue’s Sage Sense entered the fetus’ body, wanting to seal its Primordial Fiendcelestial bloodline.

Boom

Han Jue trembled and his eyes narrowed.

Backlash!

A powerful force erupted from the fetus, resisting his Sage Sense.

“This kid…”

Han Jue was triggered.

I want to suppress your bloodline. Didn’t you want to come out?

Han Jue’s eyes narrowed and he continued to try.

Xing Hongxuan frowned. Her stomach hurt, but she was a Sage, after all. She was not afraid of pain.

The fetus was still resisting Han Jue’s Sage Sense. Thus, he had no choice but to use his Dharmic powers.

After a long while…

Han Jue stopped and said, “His bloodline is not simple. I’ll seal it if you really want him to be born. However, he won’t be a genius after he’s born.”

Xing Hongxuan frowned. “Must you seal it?”

Han Jue said, “Definitely. Otherwise, it will attract a calamity. You can’t mention this to anyone, including him.”

Xing Hongxuan was silent.

She had long guessed that this child was extraordinary

“Then, let’s wait a little longer. Perhaps I’m thinking too much. He’s not meant to be born yet,” Xing Hongxuan said in a low voice.

Han Jue nodded and secretly sealed his son’s intelligence, lest it grew into an old demon before he was born.

Xing Hongxuan stood up and left.

After she left, Han Jue thought silently, “Will my son never be born normally if I remain as the Primordial Fiendcelestial?”

(Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

(Yes]

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.

Then, I’ll nurture it for another eight million

years!

He would wait until he gathered the Primordial Chaos Great Creation.

A hundred thousand years later, Han Jue’s Dharmic powers had already increased several times. The 10.8 decillion stars transformed again.

Han Jue was very satisfied with this cultivation success. Although he didn’t know how long it would take for him to break through, there was at least hope.

There were very few Great Dao Supremes in the Chaos. Even most Great Dao Sages did not know of the existence of this realm. One had to know that the number of Great Dao Sages was scant.

The reason why he stopped was that an aura appeared outside the Heavenly Dao.

Chaotic Fiendcelestial, Red Fate.

She had been waiting for more than two thousand years.

Han Jue created a clone and asked it to find Red Fate.

In the Dark Forbidden Zone, Red Fate was meditating and cultivating.

She opened her eyes and smiled when she saw Han Jue flying over.

“Why are you visiting again?” he asked.

He had deliberately left Red Fate hanging for more than two thousand years. He did not expect this woman to not leave.

Red Fate said, “What’s the matter? Fellow Daoist Han, why are you so wary of me? I didn’t attack the Heavenly Dao or scheme against you.”

Han Jue remained silent.

Red Fate said, “Forget it, let’s get down to business. A group of terrifying existences called the Divine Authority Generals appeared in the depths of the Chaos. They seem to be searching for something. A Chaotic Fiendcelestial resisted them and was directly killed. His body and soul were destroyed.”

So domineering?

Han Jue raised his eyebrows.

Could it be that the Divine Authority Generals wanted to use the name of the inspector to purge the Chaos?

Red Fate said, “I went to ask the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial and discovered that he was no longer in the Grand Primordium Domain. He’s missing. Not only that, but even his subordinates are gone.”

Han Jue showed a frown.

Red Fate sighed. “This old fellow definitely knew something in advance and went to hide somewhere. I came to find you this time to discuss how to face the Divine Authority Generals.”

“Do you know their strength and numbers?” Han Jue asked.

Red Fate said, “The cultivation of a Great Dao Sage, and a top Great Dao Sage at that. There are nearly ten thousand of them. This power is almost invincible. We either give up resisting or die if we face them alone.”

Han Jue asked, “Can we survive by giving up resisting?”

Red Fate said, “The Chaotic lifeforms can survive, but only one Chaotic Fiendcelestial has encountered a Divine Authority General and died. In addition, the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial has disappeared. I’m worried…

“Besides, Pangu has disappeared for a long time. Don’t you find it strange?

“I suspect that a mysterious existence is secretly plotting against the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, wanting to eliminate us all.”

Han Jue frowned even more. He was enlightened.

That was really possible!

The Chaotic Consciousness definitely knew that the Chaotic Fiendcelestials could evolve into a Primordial Fiendcelestial. Pangu had tried it back then.

He had to eliminate all possibilities if he couldn’t find the Primordial Fiendcelestial.

He had to eliminate all the Chaotic Fiendcelestials first. It would take the Primordial Fiendcelestial a long time to become strong even if it was born from the Chaotic lifeforms.

The threat would be too great if the Great Dao Supremes and Great Dao Sages transformed into Primordial Fiendcelestials!

Han Jue asked, “Does the Foolish Sword Sage have a chance of winning against a Divine Authority General alone before attaining the Great Dao Supreme Realm?”

Red Fate asked curiously, “What is the Great Dao Supreme? The realm above the Great Dao

Sage?”

Han Jue hesitated for a moment and nodded.

Red Fate was deep in thought.

Han Jue coughed and interrupted her thoughts.

“Of course. The Foolish Sword Sage is definitely a top-notch existence among the Great Dao Sages. According to what I know, that Chaotic Fiendcelestial whose body and soul was destroyed first fought two Divine Authority Generals before being swarmed and cruelly killed.”

Han Jue said, “Since the Divine Authority Generals are so powerful, why are you looking for me? We can only hope that they don’t really want to eliminate the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Don’t resist when the time comes.”

He wished that more Chaotic Fiendcelestials would die.

After all, the Chaotic Fiendcelestials also hated the Primordial Fiendcelestial.

Red Fate pretended to be pitiful. “Fellow Daoist Han, are you really willing to place your life in the hands of the Divine Authority Generals? I didn’t come to find you to join forces to resist them. That will be courting death. I want to hide with you. Fellow Daoist Han’s Dao Field is mysterious and can’t be deduced. Perhaps you can avoid them.”

So this was her objective!

Han Jue snorted in his heart.

He shook his head and said, “It’s just a special restriction. The Dao Field will still be in the Heavenly Dao if we really encounter a Divine Authority General. We won’t be able to hide.”

Red Fate frowned.

Han Jue said, “Moreover, you have to submit to me if you want to enter my Dao Field. I’ll use some methods on you, else I’ll be worried.”

Red Fate was a Great Dao Sage and a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. She would also be a great combatant if he subdued her.

Red Fate frowned even more.

“Go back and consider it. Think about it before looking for me,” Han Jue said and left.

Red Fate stayed for a while before leaving.

Inside the Daoist temple.

Han Jue thought, “I want to see the process of the Divine Authority Generals killing the Chaotic Fiendcelestial that Red Fate mentioned!”

(1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

How expensive!

Continue!

Han Jue entered the illusion.

He opened his eyes and discovered that he had appeared in a void. Dark lights were distributed parallel to the void. In front of him was a huge skeleton covered in countless stars.

Han Jue sensed something and turned around. He saw a strong light appear in the darkness behind him and sweep over.

He narrowed his eyes as he saw mighty figures in the strong light. They were even taller than Buzhou Divine Mountain. They walked side by side, and their figures were like armor. They were domineering and powerful.
