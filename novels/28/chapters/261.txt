Chapter 262 Fusing the Great Dao Fragments

Han Jue didn’t know that the Heavenly Dao Buddha was looking for the Victorious Fighting Buddha’s true murderer. He was cultivating happily.

After only the Demon Emperor was left, Han Jue felt the pressure decrease.

His next goal was to become a Rank Two Immortal Emperor.

Although it was very difficult to achieve the Emperor Realm, he couldn’t stop at Rank One Immortal Emperor.

The more difficult it was, the more he had to grasp every day. Time passed.

Year after year passed. The True Dragon Race did not come to the Reroll World again. Even the Fusang Tree did not shake any more, as if the danger had been resolved.

It seemed that only the Thirteenth Prince was interested in the Reroll World.

In the blink of an eye, twenty years passed.

Han Jue’s cultivation level was steadily increasing, but he was still far from becoming a Rank Two Immortal Emperor.

On this day.

The providence of the Reroll World increased again, and the limit of the world rose to the Earth Immortal Realm.

Only those who surpassed the Earth Immortal Realm would be expelled by the Heavenly Dao. The Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth multiplied. Everyone in the world could sense it. Immediately, a rumor began to spread.

There was no need to ascend. The mortal world was the Immortal World itself!

This rumor spread wider and wider. Many Holy Lands in the mortal world acknowledged it. In just a few hundred years, the Spirit Qi of the world continued to increase.

After all, the reason why cultivators ascended was that the mortal world couldn’t allow them to advance any further.

The mastermind behind this rumor was the White-Robed Buddha. He had put in a lot of effort to increase the Reroll World’s strength.

As the world’s cultivation limit increased, Han Jue also began to allow disciples who hadn’t reached the Heaven Immortal Realm to go out and train.

Especially the eight Han brothers, they could go out and broaden their horizons.

For a time, the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain was much quieter.

Han Jue was cultivating the Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering Technique in the cave abode.

Even if he reached the Immortal Emperor Realm, his Stellar Primordial Body could still become stronger.

(Detected that the Heavenly Court is declaring war on the Demon Court. You have the following choices:)

[1: Immediately ascend and join the Heavenly Court to fight for providence. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Mystical Power inheritance, and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.)

[2: Don’t ascend for the time being. Stay away from trouble and cultivate in a low-profile manner. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment.]

Han Jue was stunned. The Heavenly Court was declaring war on the Demon Court?

In the past, it was always others provoking the Heavenly Court. This time…

The Heavenly Emperor had gotten arrogant!

Looking at the system reward, it was obviously trying to lure Han Jue into the battle.

Could this be the beginning of the Immeasurable Calamity?

No!

I can’t involve myself!

Han Jue silently chose the second option and obtained another Great Dao Fragment.

At this point, he had accumulated nine Grand Dao Fragments! Now, he could sense the Great Dao and obtain a Supreme Dao technique.

Han Jue had been waiting for this moment!

He had thought that he would have to wait until he was three thousand years old before he could obtain the ninth Great Dao Fragment. He didn’t expect the Heavenly Emperor to give him a surprise.

Han Jue’s favorability towards the Heavenly Emperor increased. The current favorability was 9 stars.

Han Jue adjusted his emotions and chased Dao Comprehension Sword out. Then, he took out the nine Great Dao Fragments.

The fragments were like pieces of a compass. Their color was different and looked very inconsistent. They didn’t seem to be fragments of the same item.

Han Jue carefully used his Dharmic powers to fuse the nine Great Dao Fragments.

In an instant, a strong light burst forth, illuminating the cave abode.

Han Jue felt an extremely terrifying aura!

This was an unprecedented feeling of terror!

In front of this aura, he, a Rank One Immortal Emperor, seemed like he would be reduced to ashes at any moment.

Was this the aura of the Great Dao?

Han Jue was shocked. Why was his Dao of Life and Death not so powerful?

The strong light in front of him suddenly surged into his body and his eyes closed.

The light dissipated, and the nine Great Dao Fragments were already gone.

Outside the cave abode.

Li Yao, Long Hao, Dao Comprehension Sword, the Black Hell Chicken, Xun Chang’an, Chu Shiren, and the Three-Headed Wyrm King, who were cultivating under the tree, couldn’t help but look over.

Apart from them, the others had already gone out to train.

Moved, Xun Chang’an muttered, “This aura…” He had felt it before!

He had felt it from the Buddha Ancestor!

Chu Shiren’s heart beat faster. For some reason, he was stunned when he sensed the aura coming from the Connate Cave Abode.

Unconsciously, he saw some fragmented images that were unfamiliar and yet familiar to him.

“No way, Master is breaking through again?” the Three-Headed Wyrm King exclaimed.

How long had it been?

Everyone was already used to this and did not reply.

Chu Shiren slowly closed his eyes.

Xun Chang’an glanced at him with a meaningful gaze.

Han Jue’s consciousness came to a mysterious space filled with purple mist. There was nothing else.

He floated in confusion until his consciousness became clear.

Han Jue stopped and thought in confusion, “Where… Was I not fusing the Great Dao Fragments?”

Why was he here?

Han Jue observed his surroundings carefully.

Huh?

Isn’t this purple mist the Chaotic Qi in my body? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Why is there such a huge quantity?

Could it be that his consciousness was in his body now?

But why were there no billions of stars?

Han Jue was even more confused and started to wander around. However, this space was endless. Even if he erupted with the speed of an Immortal Emperor, he still couldn’t reach the end. He couldn’t even leave this space. Han Jue panicked. Could it be that he was attacked by a mighty figure and his soul was trapped here?

After a long time.

After confirming that he couldn’t escape, Han Jue gave up. He began to meditate and cultivate.

“What?”

Han Jue was pleasantly surprised to find that his cultivation speed was much faster than before.

Wait!

So he wasn’t trapped, after all. Could this be the process of fusing the Great Dao Fragments?

Supreme Dao techniques weren’t directly inherited, but created by oneself?

After thinking it through, Han Jue began to comprehend the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique.

The reason why he could cultivate to this day was mainly because of this cultivation technique. If he wanted to create a stronger cultivation technique, he could only use the Six Paths of Reincarnation as the foundation.

Han Jue suddenly had a bold thought.

If he fused the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique and the Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering Technique…

The Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique emphasized comprehensive rules, and the Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering Technique used strength to attain the Dao and domineeringly improved the body.

Boom

The purple mist from all directions surged into Han Jue’s body. His consciousness entered an extremely mysterious state.

The things he couldn’t understand in the past began to dawn on him like the clouds parting to reveal the sun. Everything became clear.

Countless thoughts appeared in Han Jue’s mind. It was like the explosion of the universe.

Dao begets One, One begets Two, Two begets Three, Three begets all things!

He began to create a new cultivation technique!

Heavenly Court, Numinous Palace.

The immortals were discussing how to attack the Demon Court. The Heavenly Emperor sat on his throne and listened quietly. At this moment, the Numinous Palace suddenly shook violently.

Shocked, the immortals took out their treasures and waited.

“What’s happening?”

“Enemy attack?”

“I can’t sense the enemy’s aura!”

“No, it’s not an enemy attack, it’s providence! The Heavenly Court’s providence is increasing!”

“Why is this happening?”

In an uproar, the immortals spread their divine senses.

The Heavenly Emperor frowned and calculated with his fingers. Then, his expression changed drastically. He deduced that the providence of the Heavenly Court was rising at an extremely terrifying speed. Not only that, but a certain power of rules that was even stronger than the Heavenly Dao descended and enveloped the Heavenly Court. Someone is becoming a Zenith Heaven cultivator?

Impossible!

The Heavenly Emperor knew the Heavenly Court extremely well. There was no such person!
