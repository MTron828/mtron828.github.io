Chapter 780 Preparation for the Immeasurable Calamity!

“That’s right. He has to be punished for challenging the Sages’ authority.”

“Let him reincarnate and cultivate again?”

“Too ruthless. It’s not easy to nurture a prodigy.”

“The Heavenly Dao still lacks prodigies?”

“The key is whether we should attack. Won’t we be bullying the weak?”

The Sages began to discuss Xia Zhizun.

Speechless, Han Jue said, “Don’t lose the big picture for a small matter. Let’s see what he does next before making a decision.”

In his opinion, this was a small matter. There was no need to become the focus of discussion among the Sages.

The Sages smiled awkwardly and continued discussing the previous matter.

At the same time, outside the hall.

A white-robed man stood in the void. He had a handsome face and an imposing appearance. His every move emitted the aura of an expert.

Xia Zhizun, the number one prodigy of the Divine Palace!

He believed that he was also the number one prodigy of the Heavenly Dao!

He had dominated the Immortal World and challenged experts everywhere ever since he had become a Zenith Heaven cultivator. He had never been defeated and his cultivation level had always been increasing. A hundred thousand years ago, he had even gone to the Chaos to wander. He had yet to encounter any opponents at the same realm.

He suddenly wanted to challenge a Sage!

However, in the vast Chaos, it was extremely difficult to encounter a Sage.

He could only return to the Heavenly Dao and at least know that the Sages were outside the 33rd Heaven.

“Why are you ignoring me?”

Xia Zhizun frowned. He also knew that his cultivation was a little low, but he really couldn’t restrain his desire to challenge a Sage.

He was in a dilemma. Disciples were cultivating in the various Sage Dao Fields outside the 33rd Heaven. They were all experts in the Immortal World. Wouldn’t he be embarrassing himself and make all living beings laugh at him if he left like this?

Wouldn’t he offend the Sages if he barged into the Sage Dao Field?

He was no match for a group of Sages no matter how powerful he was!

Xia Zhizun felt some regret.

He could only force himself to continue waiting

Several hours later, the Sages discussed how to consolidate the loyalty of the geniuses to the Heavenly Dao.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Han Jue and said, “The Heavenly Dao has been restarted for a million years. The first calamity should be coming. Qin Ling, who should have stirred up the calamity, is not in the Heavenly Dao…”

Unlike before the Heavenly Dao restarted, the current calamity was mainly to let all living beings vent. Although it was peaceful now, many cultivators used the rules of peace to bully the weak.

It was very difficult to achieve true peace!

Han Jue asked, “What form will the calamity take?”

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I’ve thought about it repeatedly. It’s not a good thing to directly start a war. Then, the rules of the calamity should die with the old Heavenly Dao. I plan to focus on the Human Race, the Divine Palace, and the Buddhist Sect and let Qin Ling reincarnate as a mortal. Because he suffered when he was young, his clansmen were accidentally killed by the Buddhist disciples when they were subduing demons. With such a background, he joined the Divine Palace by chance and became a prodigy.

“In order to take revenge, Qin Ling wants to overthrow the Buddhist Sect. During this period, the other Sage Sects and races can join. They can either support Qin Ling or the Buddhist Sect. The Buddhist Sect also wants to maintain the rules of peace.

“After a huge battle, the son of the Buddhist Sect’s Immeasurable Calamity died. He made a great wish and aroused the pity of all living beings. He firmly determined the Heavenly Dao to be peaceful. Qin Ling comprehended the Dao and his Dao heart was clear. He suddenly realized that he had made a serious mistake and converted to the Buddhist Sect to promote the Buddhist philosophy of peace in the future.”

This script was not bad.

Han Jue was satisfied. It was equivalent to giving Qin Ling fame.

The Buddhist Sect might be despised in the early stages, but it would be cleansed again and even obtain the participation of a large number of disciples after the calamity ended.

Qin Ling was Han Yu’s most precious grand-disciple. Han Jue naturally couldn’t let him suffer.

Han Jue said, “Qin Ling’s body was left in the Hidden Sect and his soul was reincarnated. When taking revenge, he couldn’t defeat the mighty figure of the Buddhist Sect and felt despair. Later, Li Xuan’ao informed him of his background in his previous life, so he went to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and knelt down to seek strength. I then returned his body and let him escape the suffering of the mortal world. At the same time, he recovered his strength and ended the calamity.”

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du praised, “Good idea.”

The other Sages of the older generation agreed. Qiu Xilai had no objections. It looked like the Buddhist Sect was at a disadvantage, but it would benefit the most as long as the calamity went smoothly.

Put down the butcher’s knife and become a Buddha!

The main philosophy of the Buddhist Sect was to ensure peace for all living beings.

The new Sages had strange expressions.

Was this the truth of the calamity?

The Sages had already decided on the entire process, including the outcome!

The new Sage recalled the legendary calamities and couldn’t help but be terrified.

Everything was planned ahead! Heavenly Venerate Wufa smiled. “Perfect. Isn’t there a rash junior outside the door? Why don’t we let him fight Qin Ling and both sides will be injured? The two top geniuses of the world will die together in order to fight for the Sage position. It will become a legend that will last for generations. Isn’t it more meaningful to reincarnate with such a legendary background?”

Qiu Xilai smiled. “I agree.”

Zhang Guxing hesitated.

This was courting death!

However, he would not be completely dead. He could still be revived after the calamity ended.

However, he was afraid of being played by the other Sages.

Zhang Guxing looked at Han Jue with a pleading gaze.

Han Jue said, “I think it’s feasible. In the next life, Xia Zhizun will be Qin Ling’s best brother in the Divine Palace. The two of them will fight against the Buddhist Sect together and finally return to the Divine Palace.”

What he meant was that he wanted to protect Xia Zhizun!

Sages, don’t play tricks!

Zhang Guxing heaved a sigh of relief and looked at him gratefully.

The other Sages praised Han Jue for his benevolence.

Jin Shen sighed secretly.

Authority was so disgusting.

Xia Zhizun also involved Pan Xin. After all, he was a descendant of Pangu. Unfortunately, Pan Xin was not in the Heavenly Dao right now. However, with Han Jue’s agreement, there was no problem. The calamity could already be prepared.

The matter of the calamity was settled.

Han Jue disappeared.

The moment he left, the Sages relaxed and began to laugh. They were not as serious as before.

Li Taigu said meaningfully, “Zhang Guxing, you’re still too lax with the Divine Palace. Even if Xia Zhizun can escape today, can Senior Han save the second Xia Zhizun?”

Zhang Guxing sighed. “We should indeed discipline him strictly.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He stood up and prepared to teach Xia Zhizun a lesson.

He had lost all his face today.

After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue sent a dream to Zhou Fan and told him about the calamity. He then asked him to tell Qin Ling to hurry up and return.

Qin Ling would suffer in the calamity, but after the calamity ended, he would obtain a huge amount of Heavenly Dao providence that could increase his cultivation. At the same time, his name would be passed down in the Heavenly Dao for ten thousand years. He would receive countless benefits if he constantly absorbed faith.

“Is this a Sage? Interesting,” Han Jue muttered to himself as he opened his eyes.

It had to be said that the feeling of deciding the fate of all living beings was wonderful. No wonder the Sages were obsessed.

Han Jue was not a good person, but he was not a bad person either. In his opinion, such a calamity was good. It was better than accumulating conflicts, causing chaos to break out sooner or later.

He had to sacrifice something if he wanted the entire Heavenly Dao to maintain a good development.

Han Jue began to observe the Heavenly Dao and took in the various forms of life.

The number of ghosts in the Immortal World and the myriad worlds was indeed increasing. Although it couldn’t affect the Heavenly Dao for the time being, the speed was indeed not optimistic.

No wonder Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du wanted to prepare for the calamity.
