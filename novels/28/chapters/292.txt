Chapter 294 Fighting the Divine Emperor!

At the edge of the Yellow Spring, the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor, who was dressed in a red robe, sat on the shore and cultivated.

He suddenly opened his eyes and frowned.

“Damn it! That dog cursed me again!”

The Golden Crow Divine Emperor almost died of anger.

He had chased Han Jue for so many years but still couldn’t find him.

He wanted to give up, but Han Jue would curse him from time to time. How could he stand it?

He had to kill this fellow!

The Golden Crow Divine Emperor’s expression changed slightly. He began to use his Dharmic powers to resist the mysterious curse.

“What’s going on? Why is his curse so strong? Did he break through?”

The Golden Crow Divine Emperor thought uneasily as a sense of danger arose in his heart.

No!

He had to find that dog quickly, or he would be in trouble!

A month later.

The Golden Crow Divine Emperor suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. His expression darkened as he hurriedly suppressed the chaotic Dharmic powers in his body.

On the other side.

Inside the Connate Cave Abode.

Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at the Book of Misfortune in his hand. He was secretly shocked.

The Book of Misfortune became stronger after it was upgraded to a Deity Realm Numinous Treasure. The Dharmic powers it could carry also increased greatly. In the past, it used up to ten million years of lifespan to curse and required a few months. Now, it only needed a month. This was still something he used cautiously. If he used his full strength, the time could be compressed even shorter.

After the curse power of the Book of Misfortune became stronger, although the burden on Han Jue also increased, it temporarily couldn’t affect his soul and wouldn’t cause permanent damage to his body. This was a good thing.

Han Jue was still worried that the Book of Misfortune would become a double-edged sword.

From the looks of it, as long as he didn’t go overboard, the Book of Misfortune would not affect him.

Han Jue thought for a moment and continued cursing. Although he had lost ten million years of his lifespan, ever since he broke through to the Rank Three Immortal Emperor Realm, his lifespan had already exceeded ten trillion years. In other words, even after he cursed many enemies, his lifespan had increased greatly instead.

Another two months passed.

Han Jue finally saw an email.

[Because of your curse, your enemy Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor has lost his cultivation and has fallen to a Rank Eight Immortal Emperor.]

Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief as he put down the Book of Misfortune and wiped the blood off his face.

Losing a total of 70 million years of lifespan was worth it!

Han Jue continued cursing the Demon Emperor, Golden Roc Demon Lord, Heavenly Dao Buddha, and Li Xuan’ao. Everyone was cursed for five days. This was just to mess with their mental state. After cursing, he put down the Book of Misfortune. Then, he split a soul fragment and quickly left Hidden Sect Island. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He wanted to find the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor!

Since the other party had already fallen to a Rank Eight Immortal Emperor, he could be killed!

No one had ever chased after Han Jue so persistently. He naturally wouldn’t let him go!

On a cliff.

The Golden Crow Divine Emperor frowned as he stared at the figure meditating under the cliff.

It was Ji Xianshen!

At this moment, Ji Xianshen’s entire body was trembling. His head was also shaking non-stop. His expression changed irregularly as if he had gone mad. The Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor happened to pass by this place and discovered that there was something wrong with Ji Xianshen’s aura. Therefore, he stopped to look.

Pinching his fingers to deduce, his expression changed slightly.

This fellow was actually related to Han Jue!

The Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor immediately revealed a sinister smile. He raised his palm and slapped out, causing a terrifying pressure to descend from the sky, instantly pressing Ji Xianshen down.

Ji Xianshen was jolted awake. He looked up at the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor and said angrily, “What do you mean by this?”

He had finally escaped from the Ksitigarbha Palace. Ji Xianshen wanted to cultivate for a period of time, but he did not expect to be attacked again.

Why!

Rage burned in Ji Xianshen’s heart. He believed that he had never done anything outrageous or offended anyone. Why was it that people kept finding trouble with him?

“Do you know him?”

The Golden Crow Divine Emperor raised his hand and used his Dharmic powers to manifest Han Jue’s appearance.

The moment Ji Xianshen saw Han Jue, he couldn’t help but frown. He asked in a low voice, “Are you looking for him?”

“That’s right. I want to kill him. Tell me, where is he hiding in the netherworld?” the Golden Crow Divine Emperor looked down at Ji Xianshen and asked coldly.

Ji Xianshen was furious. Han Jue was one of his few friends. How could he tolerate others chasing after his friends?

Ji Xianshen suddenly leaped up and spread his arms. Countless black lightning interwove around his body. He was like the Thunder God from ancient times, insufferably arrogant and domineering.

Without another word, Ji Xianshen raised his hand and waved it at the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor.

Boom

A deafening boom erupted in the sky. Ten thousand bolts of lightning suddenly descended as if the sky was collapsing as it bombarded the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor. The Golden Crow Divine Emperor smiled disdainfully. He raised his right hand and squeezed through the air, directly crushing countless bolts of lightning. “A mere Grand Unity Golden Immortal dares to compete with me?”

The Golden Crow Divine Emperor’s laughter was so wild and arrogant, filled with disdain.

“Perfect, I’ll start with you first and let you experience the consequences of offending me!”

His smile became sinister. His anger rose uncontrollably when he thought of Han Jue cursing him in secret. Ji Xianshen’s expression was cold as he charged towards the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor.

A huge battle erupted!

Above the Yellow Spring, Han Jue’s soul fragment moved forward aimlessly.

“Strange, why isn’t that stinky bird shouting anymore?”

Han Jue was surprised. Previously, he could hear the cries of the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor from time to time, but recently, he couldn’t hear it.

Did something happen to him?

Han Jue was puzzled when he suddenly felt a powerful aura of battle.

His eyes lit up.

Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor!

I’ve finally found you!

Next, I’ll let you know what true cruelty is!

Han Jue immediately contacted his main body and asked it to hurry over. Then, he went forward to see who was fighting the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor.

The area ahead was devastated and surrounded by a dark mist that looked like smoke. The ground had countless cracks, forming a bottomless valley. The sky was even burning with raging flames.

In the air.

The Golden Crow Divine Emperor grabbed Ji Xianshen’s head with one hand and raised him in the air. He smiled disdainfully and said, “The power of the Divine General. No wonder you dared to attack me. Unfortunately, your body is too weak. Even the Devil Ancestor can’t save you!”

Covered in blood, Ji Xianshen gritted his teeth and glared at the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor. At this moment, he didn’t even have the strength to move.

The difference in power was too great.

It was so great that Ji Xianshen’s confidence was crushed.

A wisp of black smoke rose from the top of his head and condensed into a ghost figure. “Golden Crow Divine Clan, do you really want to become enemies with the Devil Race?”

The Golden Crow Divine Emperor smiled disdainfully. “What are the devils? You’re just street rats! Tell me, where is that dog?”

Ji Xianshen raised his right hand with difficulty and wanted to slap the face of the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor. The Golden Crow Divine Emperor’s eyes turned cold, and Ji Xianshen’s right arm burned with True Sun Flame.

“Ahhh,”

The pain that penetrated deep into his soul made Ji Xianshen scream hoarsely. He was extremely miserable.
