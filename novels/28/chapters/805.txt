Chapter 807 Foolish Sword Sage Versus Pangu

(1: Exit seclusion immediately and kill the Strength Fiendcelestial. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Creation Spirit Stone.]

[2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and do not participate in the conflict. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Creation Spirit Stone.)

The Strength Fiendcelestial should be Pangu!

He had already confirmed that Pangu had reincarnated.

Han Jue was afraid of provoking him and had never created the Strength Fiendcelestial.

Was Pangu finally going to appear after so many years?

Seeing that the rewards were the same, Han Jue didn’t hesitate and directly chose the second option.

He took out the Creation Spirit Stone and fused it with a ball of Fiendcelestial Qi in the Primordial World. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Han Jue looked up into the depths of the chaos and began to search for the Strength Fiendcelestial’s aura.

After a long while…

He finally felt a very powerful Chaotic Fiendcelestial aura.

This aura was especially different from ordinary living beings. It was filled with ruthlessness and caused one to feel danger.

However, he couldn’t see the Strength Fiendcelestial’s existence. It should be hiding in a special space-time dimension.

Han Jue retracted his gaze.

An hour later, he opened his eyes again.

He felt inexplicably horrified as if his natural enemy had appeared.

This feeling was very subtle but also very accurate. It could directly tell him the reason.

If he was already like this, the other Chaotic Fiendcelestials should feel it even more deeply.

“I’m a Primordial Fiendcelestial. Why do I feel it, too?”

Han Jue was surprised. Could it be that the Primordial Fiendcelestial and the Chaotic Fiendcelestial were really related by the evolution chain?

Forget it, it’s none of my business.

Han Jue closed his eyes again and continued cultivating.

In the dark space, boundless mist spread. At the edge of the lake.

Han Tuo and Yi Tian meditated and cultivated quietly.

They suddenly opened their eyes at the same time. A terrifying aura erupted from their bodies and their faces became sinister.

Indescribable anger erupted from their hearts like a volcano erupting. Their auras surged until their long hair fluttered like dragons and snakes.

The two of them gasped and glared ahead.

< After a long time, the uncontrollable anger

dissipated.

Yi Tian turned to look at Han Tuo and asked, “What did you feel just now?”

Han Tuo’s eyes were cold as he said, “Killing intent. A bone-chilling killing intent that comes from the soul resonance.”

Yi Tian snorted. “That’s right. Unfortunately, we’re not strong enough. We’re not even qualified.”

He did not say anything, but Han Tuo understood.

At this moment, a ball of demonic Qi appeared behind the two of them and transformed into the Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan.

Lu Yuan said, “Do you feel it?”

The two of them turned around and nodded.

Lu Yuan said, “Pangu’s reincarnation. The previous battle of the Fiendcelestials is about to begin again.”

Han Tuo frowned and asked, “Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?”

Lu Yuan said, “No, the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity is to be activated by the Primordial Fiendcelestial. Pangu appeared to purge the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. He wants to use the power of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials to strengthen himself and prepare to welcome the birth of the Primordial Fiendcelestial.

“In other words, you will be his target.

“Me too.”

Han Tuo and Yi Tian frowned.

Lu Yuan said faintly, “Even the three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials are not Pangu’s match. There are less than a hundred now. Pangu will be invincible.”

Han Tuo asked, “Aren’t the Great Dao Divine Spirits going to do anything?” Lu Yuan said, “They won’t. If they did, Pangu wouldn’t be so world-shattering. It might be the leader of the gods.”

“Who is the leader of the gods?”

“Unspeakable name.”

Han Tuo and Yi Tian were silent.

Lu Yuan said, “Prepare to welcome Pangu. What a good plan. No wonder the Great Dao Divine Spirits didn’t pursue Life and me. They were all plotting for Pangu. They were waiting for Pangu to clean up the chaos and let him become stronger. Pangu and the Primordial Fiendcelestial will be natural enemies when the latter appears. Only one can survive!”

Han Tuo frowned. “Be it Pangu or the Primordial Fiendcelestial, the Chaos will still face the winner among them. Could it be that the Great Dao Divine Spirits expect them to both be injured? An existence like them can recover instantly even if they are severely injured. Can’t the Great Dao Divine Spirits think of this?”

Lu Yuan said, “If we guessed this, there wouldn’t be the current situation.

“Cultivate well. I’m going to find Life. You can’t leave during this period of time. You can’t stop Pangu if he comes!”

With that, the Devil Ancestor dissipated.

Yi Tian scratched his head. “Who cares? In any case, we just have to think of a way to kill Pangu. That fellow has just been successfully nurtured. Could it be that he has invincible strength the moment he is born?”.

Han Tuo took a deep breath and did not reply.

“All Chaotic Fiendcelestials, come to the Grand Primordium Domain!”

Han Jue, who was cultivating, heard the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s voice. It was probably about Pangu.

Han Jue created a clone and continued cultivating

He had to enter seclusion for at least fifty thousand years.

Besides, he was not a true Chaotic Fiendcelestial. What did killing a Chaotic Fiendcelestial have to do with him?

A thousand years later.

In the Grand Primordium Domain, the Fiendcelestials gathered in the hall.

Han Jue’s clone noticed that there were more new faces and fewer old faces.

The Foolish Sword Sage and Red Fate were on his left and right, ten thousand feet apart.

The atmosphere in the hall was tense. The good-natured Fiendcelestials of the ancient sects did not say a word.

Pangu’s name was definitely a nightmare for the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, especially for the ancient Fiendcelestials.

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial had a headache. Previously, it was still preparing to deal with the Dark Forbidden Lord. It did not expect Pangu to appear at this moment.

Somehow, he felt that he was being targeted.

A hand was approaching him.

“Pangu has just been born. What’s there to be afraid of? As long as we don’t give him time, we can kill him as soon as possible!” the Foolish Sword Sage suddenly said with a disdainful tone.

He despised the Chaotic Fiendcelestials present.

They didn’t have the arrogance of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial at all!

“Pangu was not born as the strongest Fiendcelestial. His reputation was earned by killing. We have already learned our lesson. Why should we be afraid of him?” the Foolish Sword Sage said proudly. He was not the least afraid.

An ancient Fiendcelestial mocked, “If you’re so arrogant, why don’t you kill Pangu?”

The Foolish Sword Sage smiled. “How will you thank me if I do?”

“I will serve you as your servant!”

“Alright!”

The Foolish Sword Sage stood up and left.

No Fiendcelestial stopped him.

After he disappeared, Red Fate sent a voice transmission to Han Jue, “Aren’t you going to stop him?”

Han Jue replied with a voice transmission, “I’m not close to him.”

“Then, why did he sit near you twice?”

“That’s just his wishful thinking.”

Han Jue’s reply had a double meaning.

Red Fate glanced at him and didn’t say anything else.

The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial said, “In that case, we’ll wait for Foolish Sword Sage to test Pangu’s current cultivation level.”

The Chaotic Fiendcelestials had no objections. In any case, they hated the Foolish Sword Sage.

The hall fell silent as the Fiendcelestials began to cultivate.

Thousands of years later.

They seemed to sense something and opened their eyes.

Han Jue was the same.

A Chaotic Fiendcelestial began to fight!

Han Jue was secretly curious. Could the newly nurtured Pangu defeat the Foolish Sword Sage?

According to the plan, the Foolish Sword Sage should lose. Otherwise, what would happen if Pangu died as soon as he was born?
