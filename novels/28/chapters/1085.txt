Chapter 1086 Unknown Realm

“My descendants have their own future. Let them be.”

Han Jue thought silently. It had been a long time since he interfered with his descendants and disciples.

Han Jue looked at the Chaos after reading the emails.

Peace returned to the Chaos after the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil was suppressed. Although more than half of the living beings were killed, Han Jue discovered that the providence of the Chaos was actually increasing very quickly.

!!

Not only that, but the Chaos was expanding! To be precise, it was not expanding. It was more like it was being torn apart. The chaotic space was collapsing layer by layer. The Spirit Qi also spread out and became thin.

It seemed that the Ninth Chaos was preparing to tear the Chaos apart. Of course, it was not simply tearing it apart, but an increase in creation. It broke through the restrictions of the blank domain on the Great Dao World, causing it to be distributed to every corner of the blank domain, which would usher in the Endless Era.

The Chaos was already endless to living beings below the Great Dao Sage Realm. The blank domain was even larger. Even the Dao Creators did not know how big it was.

However, one thing was certain. The current blank domain was led by the Chaos. Other than that, the other Great Dao Worlds were not big and could not threaten the Chaos.

It was unknown if the arrival of the Endless Era still needed Han Huang’s strength.

Han Jue looked forward to who the seventh Dao Creator was going to be.

Chaotic Consciousness, Yin-Yang Purity

Nirvana Deity, Chaotic Consciousness, Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, Formless Transcendent Deity, Divine Might Heavenly Sage!

Han Jue decided to wait in anticipation.

He looked at the Ultimate Origin World next. The Ultimate Origin World was still steadily developing. Humans even appeared.

The ancestor of the Human Race, Jue Yi, had obtained Han You’s legacy. It was equivalent to obtaining Han Jue’s inheritance. After attaining the Dao, he created the Human Race and attained Freedom in a few million years. Such potential was already very good. He would probably have already become a Great Dao Sage in the Chaos.

Han Jue didn’t care about his name. He saw through Han You’s thoughts and knew he wanted to please him.

Han Jue might take care of him in the future because of his name.

Unfortunately, he didn’t have that thought for

now.

Han Jue continued cultivating after seeing that everything was fine.

Two seclusion cycles passed in the blink of an

eye.

This meant that 20 million years had passed.

The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity had yet to be successfully enslaved!

Han Jue had no choice but to continue waiting. The Chaos regained its vitality after so many years. With more living beings, there were also more battles. The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was uttered by all living beings again.

The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy roped in many Dark believers after claiming to believe in the Dark Forbidden Lord. However, many troubles also followed. At least, they had severed the path of unifying the Chaos. All living beings were still very resistant to the Dark Forbidden Lord. They felt that he was not a good person just from his name and style.

However, Zhao Shuangquan was already obsessed. He swore to gather the power to

resist the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. As for unifying the Chaos, it was no longer that important to him.

Han Jue began to ignore the Chaos. He only wanted to break through and enslave the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity now. Twenty million years of cultivation allowed

Han Jue to get closer and closer to breaking

through.

He wanted to see what would happen first, his break through or the successful enslaving of the Dao Creator.

Han Jue closed his eyes.

On the other side.

The Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e had already

established their own Daoist temples at the side. After all, they had been chased out for so

long. It was impossible for them to not have a

home.

Han Jue’s seclusion made the disciples guess. Even the Dao Companions were guessing.

Han Jue’s women would gather in Xing Hongxuan’s Daoist temple every once in a while. Other than discussing the Dao, they would also chat and discuss some Chaotic

matters.

Qingluan’er sighed. “Husband hasn’t come out for a long time. Did something happen?” Li Yao said, “He should be breaking through.”

Dao Comprehension Sword chuckled. “He rarely looked at us in the past. Get used to it.”

She and Li Yao often felt like they had been forgotten by Han Jue before the Dao Field was opened.

Fairy Xi Xuan sighed. “What realm will he reach if he breaks through again?” The women sighed.

Li Yao, who was the most motivated in

cultivation, was even more fascinated.

At this moment, a voice came from outside the

Daoist temple.

“Mothers, I’m here to visit. I have something to ask of you.’

||

Han Yunjin was Li Yao’s son.

All the women doted on him, even surpassing

the other children, including Xing Hongxuan. Although Han Huang was outstanding, Han Yunjin was the only one who often returned to visit them, unlike their other children who

would not return after going out and could only meet during the Chaotic Assembly. “Come in,” Xing Hongxuan said. She was the master of the Daoist temple, so she naturally had the right to speak.

Han Yunjin entered the temple and bowed respectfully to each mother. His posture was very respectful. Even Dao Comprehension Sword beamed.

Dao Comprehension Sword smiled. “Yue’er

isn’t here. Otherwise, she would definitely be asking you questions.”

Perhaps because of their similar personalities, Dao Comprehension Sword and Chang Yue’er were very close.

Han Yunjin smiled. “She wants to take in some

women from the Han family as her disciples.

I’ve already chosen a batch of female disciples for her.”

Li Yao asked, “Just say it. What is it?”

Han Yunjin paused for a moment before

saying, “Recently, I heard that a woman wants to marry Second Brother. This woman’s father is the master of a Chaotic overlord force. In

order to attract Second Brother, he prepared to attack the Heavenly Dao and wanted to force him to appear…

Speaking of this, he was speechless.

He did not expect the Heavenly Dao to suffer

such an undeserved calamity.

He had no choice but to come to the Dao Field

because of the Sages.

Xing Hongxuan frowned. “Is this woman so domineering?”

She naturally paid attention to her daughter-in-law, but this matter made her very unhappy.

She wasn’t the only one. The others were also

very unhappy.

Qingluan’er said, “Perhaps this is the reason why Huang’er doesn’t like her.”

Xuan Qingjun smiled. “It’s not easy to subdue such a woman. Back then, I had the same attitude towards your father. I didn’t really like

him then.”

Han Yunjin smiled bitterly. “Mothers, it’s mainly the Heavenly Dao now. Most of the

descendants of the Han family are in the Heavenly Dao. The Han family will be affected

if the Hidden Sect doesn’t make a move or if Second Brother doesn’t return.” Xing Hongxuan snorted. “Sisters, why don’t we

go? We should do something after cultivating for so long.”

Xuan Qingjun’s eyes lit up. She was the Demon Lord back then.

Qingluan’er was a little nervous. She had never

fought.

Dao Comprehension Sword looked at Li Yao.

Li Yao nodded slowly under Han Yunjin’s

expectant gaze.

The strongest among the women was Li Yao. She had to take the lead.

The women grew confident since she agreed.

After all, they were facing a Chaotic overlord force.

They were convinced by Li Yao’s strength. They had sparred with each other in the simulation

trial.

Han Yunjin smiled. He admired his mother the

most. As a woman, she had a tenacious will that was not inferior to his father. Han Yunjin left after exchanging some pleasantries.

The women chatted about the situation in the

Chaos. They were also very curious about the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Xing Hongxuan, Xuan Qingjun, and Li Yao had already begun to establish their Great Dao Worlds, so they were all looking forward to the Endless Era.

…

Han Jue was immersed in cultivation.

A black vortex suddenly appeared in front of

him before his seclusion ended. He opened his eyes with a strange expression.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
