Chapter 1119 Hidden Monsters

Before Xu Qinyin could say something else, Xu Jinchen squeezed a slice of watermelon into her mouth. “Stop talking about it.”Xu Qinyin was very straightforward, and Zi Beiying understood it at once and felt a little shy. Her own older brother actually also thought that she and Xu Jinchen could be a great couple.

Zi Beiying simply took Xu Jinchen as her friend at the beginning. She knew that Xu Jinchen was a very outstanding young man, but Leng Shaoting was too noticeable to be ignored. However, she found out that Leng Shaoting already had a girlfriend, while Xu Jinchen was still single.

Zi Beiying had to admit that she gradually started paying more attention to him.

“Miss Zi, I’m so sorry. It’s just a joke. Please don’t take it seriously,” Xu Jinchen said, in case Zi Beiying felt uncomfortable.

Xu Qinyin explained it as well. “Yes, it’s just a joke. Please don’t be mad at me.”

After that, she stood up and walked to sit beside Zi Beiying. They began to play games together and dropped the topic.

About an hour later, Gu Ning finally arrived at the training grounds with Leng Shaoting. Given Leng Shaoting’s importance, it was easy for him to bring a stranger inside.

It was very late at night, so almost everyone else was having a rest.

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning went straight to the training field once they entered the base. The training base was very large, and there was an office building, dormitory and playground on one side with a woodland field training ground at the other side.

The jungle in the wood training area was quite dense and the terrain was rugged too.

It was indeed a little dangerous for soldiers to be trained here, but it also allowed them to practice their skills.

To enter the wood training ground, they had to pass through a gate, which was guarded by several soldiers. People needed permission to enter, especially after the strange disappearances a few days ago. Nevertheless, those soldiers couldn’t stop Leng Shaoting from going inside.

In the evening, the soldiers stopped training, but there were still many soldiers walking on the playground. When they saw someone entering the woods training ground, they were surprised and immediately said to the others, “Look, someone just went into the training ground, followed by a girl!”

Other soldiers all turned to look at the gate.

“Isn’t it Major General Leng’s car? The man should be him, but who’s the girl?” a soldier said.

They all knew that it was very dangerous to walk into the woods at night.

Although Leng Shaoting was an ace soldier in the special forces, it was very strange that he went there with a girl. Nevertheless, they couldn’t stop them, they could only hope that they would be fine.

Not only did they notice it, but the soldiers on duty in the surveillance room also saw it.

Nobody could stop Leng Shaoting from walking into the woods, but a soldier in the surveillance room still reported it to his senior leader in case any accidents happened.

Their commander was Zhang Zhiheng, who was 34 that year and ranked as a lieutenant colonel in the military. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Zhang Zhiheng couldn’t calmly stay in his dorm room after knowing that Leng Shaoting was in the woods. Therefore, Zhang Zhiheng called Wang Shijie, who was the battalion commander, to go to the surveillance room with him.

Although Leng Shaoting went inside with a girl, Zhang Zhiheng knew that the girl couldn’t be simple.

They didn’t believe in monsters or ghosts, so they weren’t scared, but just felt strange about what had happened to the three missing soldiers. They simply thought that the three soldiers might have fallen into a big hole in the ground or they could have become lost.

...

Once Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting entered the woods, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to observe the surroundings.

As long as there really were hidden monsters in the woods, Gu Ning could find them with the help of her magical power. Magical power was something that all the monsters wanted after all.

However, there were surveillance cameras around them, so Gu Ning didn’t release her magical power in case monsters appeared and scared the other soldiers.

In order to avoid the surveillance cameras, Gu Ning searched for the surveillance cameras around them as they walked.

When Gu Ning’s eyes accurately found every surveillance camera, Zhang Zhiheng and several other soldiers in the surveillance room were astonished.

All of a sudden, Gu Ning sensed Yin, which could only be found in monsters or ghosts, so she was sure that the three missing soldiers must have encountered monsters.

“I found something strange, so we should move lightly,” Gu Ning said to Leng Shaoting in a quiet voice.

Leng Shaoting nodded and they moved ahead lightly. When they approached the source of Yin, they were out of the area where surveillance cameras were useful.

Zhang Zhiheng knew that there weren’t surveillance cameras everywhere in the woods, so he didn’t think that it was a big deal.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting soon saw a half-meter-high pile of vegetation, which was very dense. Gu Ning then looked inside with her Jade Eyes and found that the soil was turned over.
