Chapter 2571: Can I Compete with You?

“Yeah, I just said that.” Zhao Rong answered and felt pleased in his heart. He believed that Kang Shaojie would chase Gu Ning away once he learned that she was the person who cut out three pieces of jade from five raw jade materials.

In petty people’s eyes, everyone should be as petty as them.

“Oh, who is it?” asked Kang Shaojie.

“This miss, Miss Gu.” Zhao Rong pointed at Gu Ning.

Facing Zhao Rong who was finding fault with her, Gu Ning was extremely calm. She wasn’t afraid of his scheme at all.

If Kang Shaojie really chased her out because of Zhao Rong, she would listen to him. Anyway, she could return after disguising herself as another person. She would go to the Kang family’s warehouse and take away all the raw jade materials of high quality with the excuse of wholesale.

Hearing that, Kang Shaojie turned to look at Gu Ning. He was amazed by her beauty first, then by her age.

If what Zhao Rong said was true, Gu Ning who seemed to be around twenty years old, could cut out three pieces of jade from five raw jade materials. It was extremely surprising, and he could hardly believe it.

However, even though he had doubts, he didn’t show disdain.

“Miss, did you really cut out three pieces of jade from five raw jade materials in City Teng?” asked Kang Shaojie. He was very polite, and was only curious about it.

“Yes!” Gu Ning admitted it with alacrity. It wasn’t a secret, so she was willing to admit it.

In addition, because Kang Shaojie had a very good attitude, Gu Ning was nice to him.

“Wow, I can’t believe you have such amazing abilities at such a young age! You have my respect,” said Kang Shaojie. It wasn’t a perfunctory answer since he really did admire Gu Ning. Whether it was good luck or outstanding ability, Gu Ning achieved what most other people couldn’t do.

“I’m flattered, Mr. Kang.” Gu Ning replied politely.

“Miss Gu, if you don’t mind, can I compete with you? Please don’t get me wrong, I’m not provoking you, but it’s really rare to meet someone who can cut out three pieces of jade from five raw jade materials. I just want to witness it,” said Kang Shaojie, explaining in case Gu Ning misunderstood him.

Kang Shaojie really wasn’t provoking Gu Ning, even though he did it for a reason. He wasn’t trying to be malicious, and he was actually forced to make that choice.

However, other people might have different opinions, especially Zhao Rong who knew him.

They only knew Kang Shaojie, but didn’t know much about him. It wasn’t a secret that Kang Shaojie was also good at stone-gambling. Although he didn’t have amazing records like Gu Ning. Gu Ning might not be able to be that lucky every time.

Anyway, most people believed that Gu Ning relied on good luck to cut out the three pieces of jade from the five raw jade materials.

The onlookers didn’t side with either of them. They simply wanted to know who would be the winner, but Zhao Rong undoubtedly wanted Kang Shaojie to win. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

No matter who won, it had nothing to do with him, but he just didn’t want Gu Ning to win.

“Sure!” Gu Ning could feel that he wasn’t provoking her, so she agreed. Although she couldn’t use her identity to continue to buy raw jade materials after that, because she would attract too much attention, she could disguise herself as Tang Aining or someone else.

She wasn’t wearing any makeup and was wearing a casual suit. If she put on some makeup, people who weren’t familiar with her wouldn’t be able to recognize her.

“Mr. Kang, how would you like to compete?” Gu Ning asked.

“Each of us chooses five raw jade materials, then we cut them open. Whoever has more valuable jade wins. In order to not make us enemies, we don’t need to place a big bet. Whoever loses, will just pay the bill for the winner. If both of us lose, we can settle our bills separately. How about that?” Kang Shaojie asked.

“Great, I accept that.” Gu Ning nodded. She could see that Kang Shaojie had no intention of taking advantage of her in this competition. He really just wanted to have fun with her.

After that, Gu Ning and Kang Shaojie went to choose raw jade materials separately. With a glance, Gu Ning could see whether there was jade inside, but in order to avoid unnecessary trouble, she shopped slowly.

Gu Ning didn’t want to let Kang Shaojie win, but wouldn’t make him lose by a wide margin either. Therefore, she glanced at him once in a while to see whether there was jade in the raw jade materials he chose.

If there was no jade inside, Gu Ning would only choose two raw jade materials with middle-level jade inside.

Kang Shaojie shopped very slowly. At least compared with Gu Ning, he was extremely slow. However, in other people’s eyes, he was fast. After all, he chose one within only ten minutes.

Ordinary people might need over half an hour to choose one.

The first jade raw material Kang Shaojie picked didn’t have jade inside, so Gu Ning chose one without jade too.

Because only Baili Zongxue knew that Gu Ning chose raw jade materials unbelievably fast, she only seemed very slow now to Baili Zongxue. In other people’s eyes, she was still fast.

After almost an hour, Kang Shaojie and Gu Ning finished choosing. Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see the raw jade materials Kang Shaojie chose. Among five of them, only two had jade inside. One was at middle level, while the other was at low level.

That was already very skilled in ordinary people’s eyes, but it was still barely comparable to Gu Ning.

Gu Ning was unwilling to have a big difference, so she deliberately chose two raw jade materials with jade at middle level. Her jade was only worth about ten million yuan more than Kang Shaojie’s.

Even though Gu Ning was reluctant to make Kang Shaojie lose by a significant margin, it couldn’t be too narrow. She couldn’t leave an impression on other people that she won through good luck.

After that, both Kang Shaojie and Gu Ning went to cut the stones open.

Every time they cut the stones open, they were very nervous, although they knew the probability of cutting out jade was very low.

Both of them picked a jade raw material without any jade inside first. It wasn’t surprising, but the crowd was still a little disappointed.

As for the second one, there was jade of low level in Kang Shaojie’s jade raw material, while in Gu Ning’s stone there was jade at the middle level.
