2923 Did You Lose Weight?

“I’m afraid it’s not up to you!” Gu Ning sneered. Before they could react, she attacked them.

Leng Shaoting needed to beat them, while Gu Ning mainly needed to rescue the girl.

The group of men didn’t expect Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting to attack them, so they were ill-prepared, but they were strong too, so they quickly fought back.

Although they were skilled too, they were not comparable to Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

Therefore, Gu Ning immediately rescued the girl from those vampires. The girl had lost a lot of blood, but luckily she was still alive. Without delay, Gu Ning put magical power into the girl’s body.

Those vampires were surprised by Leng Shaoting’s abilities, and they wanted to run away, but Leng Shaoting wouldn’t let them go.

Before long, they were all caught.

Because it was late at night, there wasn’t much traffic on the road and no one dared to stop and watch the fight.

After Leng Shaoting beat those vampires down, he threw them to the rear seats of the car, then he made a call.

Gu Ning’s magical power quickly circulated in the girl’s body, so the girl gradually recovered and got her consciousness back, but she was obviously scared. Filled with horror, she couldn’t stop trembling.

“Don’t be afraid. You’re fine now. Tell us your name and your family’s number. We can help you get home.” Gu Ning comforted the girl gently. She did her best to help the girl get rid of her horror.

“I-I…” The girl could hardly finish a sentence.

Gu Ning didn’t urge her. After the girl calmed down, she told Gu Ning her name and her father’s phone number.

Afterwards, Gu Ning called her father at once.

Because the girl was not gone for long, her family had no idea that she was abducted. Therefore, the girl’s father was shocked and frightened when Gu Ning told him the bad news.

The girl called her father at the same time, so her father believed Gu Ning’s words. Her father asked for their location, then hurriedly came over.

Before the girl’s parents arrived, Leng Shaoting’s people came.

Leng Shaoting called someone to drive a truck over, then he moved those vampires to the truck, because those vampires’ car was useless now.

Half an hour later, the girl’s parents came. They hugged the girl and burst into tears.

The girl’s father wanted to teach those men a lesson, but Leng Shaoting stopped him. Even though the girl’s father was reluctant to accept that, he still curbed his anger and asked, “Didn’t you call the police? How are you going to deal with those people?”

“We didn’t call the police, but I’m a soldier, so I’ll take this case seriously,” Leng Shaoting said as he took out his officer certificate.

The girl’s parents knew little about ranks in the army, but they were relieved after seeing Leng Shaoting’s officer certificate.

After that, the girl’s parents took her away.

Once they were gone, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting got back into their car. Leng Shaoting’s people would stay to deal with the vampires’ car.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting wouldn’t deal with those vampires according to the law, they would solve the problem privately.

Therefore, they stopped until they were far from the city center, then interrogated the vampires.

“Why did you come to our country?” Leng Shaoting asked.

No one answered.

Leng Shaoting then put pressure on them and asked again, “Tell me, what are you doing in our country?”

Under the pressure, one vampire finally opened his mouth.

“To carry out a task.”

“What task?” Leng Shaoting asked.

The vampire was silent once more, so Leng Shaoting continued to put pressure on him.

“To assassinate Meng Zhuokai.”

Meng Zhuokai, the Secretary-general of City B, belonged to the same faction as Tang Yunhang.

If they came to assassinate Meng Zhuokai, Meng Zhuokai or Tang Yunhang might be the target.

They were on the same boat, so they could be in the same danger as well.

“Why do you want to kill Meng Zhuokai?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“I don’t know. We are just obeying orders.”

“What else are you assigned to do?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“Nothing.”

“Are there other people in addition to you?” Leng Shaoting asked.

The vampire remained silent for a few seconds, then said, “Yes, but I have no idea where they are and what they are doing.”

In that case, Leng Shaoting stopped asking.

After the interrogation, Leng Shaoting decided to kill those vampires. They weren’t normal humans, so it wasn’t wrong for him to directly kill them, but Leng Shaoting wouldn’t do that with his own hands. Instead, he ordered the flood dragon to do that by swallowing the vampires alive.

It was cruel, but they were enemies, so he must be decisive. If he tolerated his enemies, he would be cruel to himself.

After that, he ordered the flood dragon to look around the whole City B to see whether there are other vampires.

“You need to tell your uncle about this. After all, Meng Zhuokai is in the same faction as him.” Leng Shaoting said to Gu Ning. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Sure, I’ll go to see him tomorrow,” Gu Ning replied.

Then Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went back to Huafu Hills.

The next morning, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting had breakfast at Huafu Hills, then went to visit the Tang family.

The Tang family welcomed Leng Shaoting with big smiles and hugs. They wanted him to feel at home.

“Shaoting, did you lose weight? Are you busy with work these days?” Tang Haifeng asked.

Gu Ning rolled her eyes. Leng Shaoting didn’t lose weight at all!

“Not really, I’ve been training lately,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Well, it must be tiring, so you need to eat more,” Tang Haifeng said, even though he knew Leng Shaoting could take good care of himself.

As an elder, he ought to care about the young.

“Sure, I will.” Leng Shaoting answered politely.

After having lunch at the Tang family’s house, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting rested for a while, before going to see Tang Yunhang.

Because the public institution they worked for was far from their home, they normally wouldn’t come back for lunch at noon.

Before going to see them, Gu Ning called to make sure that Tang Yunhang had time.

They couldn’t have the conversation on the phone, so Gu Ning decided to talk to Tang Yunhang face to face.
