Chapter 636 Punch Her If You’re Angry

Maybe out of guilt or something else, Xin Bei said to Cao Wenxin gently, which had never happened before, “I’m so sorry for what she has done to you, but there is nothing between her and me now. She did it on her own initiative.”

Cao Wenxin stopped eating, looking at him. “Anyway, tell her to stop harassing me, or I’ll punch her the next time. I know the address of her place.”

“Punch her if you’re angry, and leave the rest to me,” Xin Bei said. He was spoiling her, but even he didn’t realize. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Some of the women around the table felt a little scared.

Cao Wenxin’s heart, on the other hand, skipped a beat all of a sudden. She actually enjoyed the feeling of being spoiled. Her heart pounded fast, and she didn’t dare look him in the eyes.

Damn it! Why did she suddenly feel like it wasn’t a bad thing to have a boyfriend like Xin Bei? Thinking that maybe she liked Xin Bei now, Cao Wenxin felt uneasy. She moved her eyes away from him and focused on the food.

Seeing that, Xin Bei wasn’t sure whether Cao Wenxin was being shy. If so, why did she feel shy? Thinking that maybe Cao Wenxin liked him too, Xin Bei was cheered up a little.

Just when they were about to enjoy the meal again, Cao Wenxin’s phone rang a second. It was a message warning tone. Cao Wenxin read the message from a strange number and it was all bad language. She was mad at once, addressing Xin Bei, “I can’t stand it anymore. She just sent me another message with dirty language. Do you want to clear it up with her, otherwise I’ll go punch her right now?”

Xin Bei thought for a while, then said, “I’ll go with you.”

Cao Wenxin asked with confusion, “Do you want to clear it up with her or go punch her with me?”

If he was going to clear it up, she wouldn’t go with him, in case it would cause more misunderstandings. In addition, was he going to punch a woman with her?

“To clear it up. If she won’t let it go, you can punch her as you like,” Xin Bei said, and didn’t think that there was anything wrong with that.

Hearing that, some women around the table had a worse impression of Xin Bei.

“I agree!” Gu Ning said to Cao Wenxin. In fact, she thought Xin Bei probably just wanted to spend some time alone with Cao Wenxin.

Cao Wenxin and Xin Bei then stood up and left together.

“Ningning, you’re setting them up!” Xu Qinyin blinked at Gu Ning with a knowing smile.

Gu Ning smiled too, but didn’t say a word.

“Do you think Wenxin is really going to punch Yu Wenjing?” Xu Qinyin asked with curiosity.

“No idea,” Gu Ning said, but Yu Wenjing asked for it even if Cao Wenxin punched her.

“Miss Gu, do you think it’s a good idea to support the lady to punch another woman? Don’t you know it’s illegal?” Di Runa said, criticizing Gu Ning.

Actually, it was Cao Wenxin’s idea to punch Yu Wenjing, but Di Runa purposely put it as if Gu Ning had incited Cao Wenxin to do it. Di Runa said it in order to show her kindness which would accentuate Gu Ning’s cruelty so that Leng Shaoting would have a good impression of her and even start to hate Gu Ning. Di Runa was too naive.

Several other women also thought that it was inappropriate that Gu Ning had supported Cao Wenxin to punch another woman, but they knew that it was Cao Wenxin’s idea after all.

Gu Ning understood that Di Runa was picking on her.

“Miss Di, I bet you must be very tolerant, and you’ll accept any misunderstandings, dirty words and harassment, right?” Gu Ning said lightly. It was quite ironic.

Di Runa was displeased. Not only Di Runa, but other also knew that it was irony.

Gu Ning added, “In my opinion, I’ll never treat others the way I don’t want to be treated back, but I’ll pay it back if anyone dares hurt me.” It sounded like she was talking about Cao Wenxin, but she was also warning Di Runa.

Di Runa didn’t think that Gu Ning knew about her affection for Leng Shaoting, so she had no idea that Gu Ning was warning her.

“I agree! Yu Wenjing asks for it herself,” Gu Anna said.

“I can’t stand it either!” Xu Qinyin said. Xu Qinyin had never been through such a thing, but she knew that she couldn’t tolerate offensive words or behavior.

Since both Gu Anna and Xu Qinyin agreed with Gu Ning, Di Runa didn’t know what to say now. In fact, she couldn’t stand it either.

After the meal, they dispersed. No matter how unwilling Di Runa was to see Leng Shaoting leaving with Gu Ning, she could do nothing about it.

“Shouldn’t you visit Grandpa Leng at home?” Xu Jinchen asked Leng Shaoting to remind him. Leng Shaoting would visit Master Leng first once he was back in the capital before. However, Leng Shaoting spent every second with Gu Ning now.

Xu Jinchen wouldn’t judge, but thought that it was inappropriate that Leng Shaoting wouldn’t visit his grandpa now even though he was back in the capital.

Leng Shaoting was struck dumb for a second, then remember that he hadn’t visited his own grandpa yet. “Yeah, I’ll go visit him later.”

After that, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went back to their place.

Xin Bei called Yu Wenjing the moment he walked out of the hotel.

When Yu Wenjing received Xin Bei’s call she was thrilled, and Xin Bei even invited her to meet at a café.

Yu Wenjing believed that Xin Bei must have changed his mind and wanted her to be back by his side.

“She’s coming,” Xin Bei said after hanging up.
