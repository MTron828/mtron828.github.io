“Sure.” Zhan Zhiyin agreed, then Leng Shaoming took her to sleep in the master bedroom.

“Why did you take me to the master bedroom? I can sleep in the guest room,” said Zhan Zhiyin, feeling a little nervous. She wondered whether Leng Shaoming was going to sleep with her tonight.

She was willing to do that, but they just got together and she wasn’t mentally-prepared yet.

Leng Shaoming didn’t notice Zhan Zhiyin’s embarrassment, but he wouldn’t do anything inappropriate to her.

“It’s fine. I’ll sleep in the guest room,” said Leng Shaoming.

“Alright!” Zhan Zhiyin said nothing further.

After accommodating Zhan Zhiyin, Leng Shaoming went back to the living room. He picked up the micro camera and turned on his computer to edit the video. He deleted Zhan Zhiyin’s threatening Chen Yunheng and the pictures of her pointing a dagger at Chen Yunheng. If the police saw that, it would affect Zhan Zhiyin.

In fact, he only kept the most important part.

Afterwards, Leng Shaoming went to bed. However, lying in the bed for a long time, he could barely sleep because he worried about Leng Yuanqian and Leng Shaojia.

He knew that Gu Ning had superpowers, but he was still anxious.

Because it was too late, he didn’t call Leng Yuanqian about what Zhan Zhiyin found out tonight. He decided to wait till tomorrow.

Other major families heard that Leng Shaojia was abroad. After all, it was reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs first, so many people learned about it afterwards.

The major families had their members working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so they gloated over the Leng family’s misfortune and waited to watch a drama.

Although they understood that the Leng family would be suspicious of them and it would affect their families’ reputation, they didn’t care. People might just discuss them for a while.

Without evidence, they wouldn’t be seriously affected.

Early the next morning, at 6:30 am, Gu Ning took Si Jin to the airport. Their flight would take off at 9 am so they directly met Leng Yuanqian at the airport.

Gu Ning and Si Jin were staying in the siheyuan, while Leng Yuanqian was in the Leng family’s house. There was a long distance between them and there would be morning traffic jams, so they didn’t go to the Leng family’s house.

Gu Ning and Si Jin set off from the city center, so there was already a lot of traffic on the road. In order to save time, they took the subway.

Leng Yuanqian could go on the road because he wasn’t in the city center and there was not much traffic.

Halfway there, when it was nearly 7 am, Leng Yuanqian received Leng Shaoming’s call. Leng Shaoming shared the result of interrogating Chen Yunheng.

Hearing the result, Leng Yuanqian also doubted whether it was done by the Yuan family. He was simply more suspicious of the Yuan family than other families.

“I plan to call Shaoting at noon. He can help me check the surveillance cameras. I don’t want to alert them, so we can only hack into the surveillance cameras,” said Leng Shaoming. He knew Leng Shaoting needed to train in the morning, so Leng Shaoting might not be able to answer his call right now. He had to wait till noon.

“I can’t get through to Shaoting. He must be carrying out a task,” said Leng Yuanqian. He just called Leng Shaoting yesterday.

Leng Shaoming was slightly disappointed, but he couldn’t do anything about it. “Well, I guess I can just go to watch the surveillance video by myself.”

“That’s the only way,” said Leng Yuanqian.

“Dad, are you on your way?” asked Leng Shaoming.

“Yes, I’m on my way to the airport,” said Leng Yuanqian. Saying that, he became a little gloomy. Although Gu Ning could protect him well, he was afraid it would drag the Leng family into more serious trouble. Not only he and Leng Shaojia were in trouble, the whole Leng family was facing a crisis.

Even though he didn’t care much about fame and wealth, given the Leng family’s status, they weren’t allowed to decay.

If an ordinary person was a loser, he would only be disdained, but if the Leng family became weak, their country would fall into turbulence, because the Leng family was related to a very influential circle.

“Be careful,” said Leng Shaoming. That was all he could do.

“Sure, I will, you as well,” said Leng Yuanqian.

After they finished the call, Zhan Zhiyin said, “Why don’t you turn to Gu Ning for help? Doesn’t she have a game company? I bet there must be hackers in her company.”

“Oh, let me ask her about it.” Leng Shaoming immediately called Gu Ning. He didn’t have time to think about whether it was a good idea, because it was too important.

Although it was his own business, it could become the Leng family’s problem if he didn’t handle it well.

Before long, Gu Ning picked up his call, then Leng Shaoming introduced the situation to her.

“Alright, I’ll order someone to do an investigation right away. I’ll send you a phone number after hanging up. If you need any help from a hacker, call him. I’ll tell him to contact you once he finds anything,” said Gu Ning.

Because they were going to take a flight and needed to spend seven hours in the plane, she was afraid that she wouldn’t be able to help Leng Shaoming with it later. After all, Leng Shaoming couldn’t get through to Leng Shaoting, so she gave him K’s number.

As for Leng Shaoming’s safety, Gu Ning wasn’t worried because Zhan Zhiyin was with him.

“Great, thank you so much, Gu Ning.” Leng Shaoming thanked her sincerely. He finally realized who the good people were when he was in trouble. He used to hold hostility against Gu Ning, but now he felt it was stupid.

“We’re a family. You don’t need to thank me. Alright, I’m in the subway now. I can’t talk to you for long. Be careful,” said Gu Ning.

Leng Shaoming felt guiltier when Gu Ning said they were a family, and he felt deeply touched too. “Alright, you should also take good care of yourself.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After hanging up, Gu Ning sent Leng Shaoming K’s phone number. As for K’s name, she told Leng Shaoming it was Mu Ye. Because she was in the subway, she couldn’t send Leng Shaoming a voice message. She sent him a regular message.
