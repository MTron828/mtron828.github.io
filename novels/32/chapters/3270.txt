3273 Not Afraid of Becoming a Joke

“If so, are you also too confident to be nervous? Are you also going to win the championship?” Leng Xiaoyao asked in return, showing obvious mockery.

Gao Qilu was struck dumb for a moment, and didn’t know what to say. She had no confidence to win the championship although she really wanted to be the champion. All the participants were the best students from their schools, so it was extremely difficult to win the competition.

In fact, when she took part in a competition like this for the first time, she had the confidence to win the championship, but was embarrassed in the end. Afterwards, she learned to keep a low profile. Even though she still targeted the championship, she wouldn’t say that aloud.

She only said that to Leng Xiaoyao because Leng Xiaoyao was also an excellent student and seemed arrogant. However, unexpectedly, Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t easy to take advantage of.

After hearing Leng Xiaoyao’s retort, Mr. Chen had a more positive impression of her.

It was true that Leng Xiaoyao only said that she wasn’t nervous. She didn’t say that she was going to win the championship. Although she wasn’t nervous, it didn’t mean that she would definitely be the champion.

“Gao Qilu, if you’re confident because you think you’ll be the champion, I can understand why you said that to me. If not, please don’t jump to conclusions. It bothers me.” Leng Xiaoyao warned.

She didn’t know what Gao Qilu wanted to do, but she knew that Gao Qilu must be doing it for a bad reason. Therefore, she decided to warn Gao Qilu first.

Gao Qilu was too angry to speak, while Qin Siyuan remained silent.

He was jealous of Leng Xiaoyao too, but he wouldn’t fight with her. He wasn’t that dumb.

Gao Qilu said nothing else, so Leng Xiaoyao stopped arguing with her.

Nevertheless, Gao Qilu hated Leng Xiaoyao more than ever because Leng Xiaoyao embarrassed her in front of Mr. Chen and Qin Siyuan.

However, she was too self-centered to admit that she asked for it. If she hadn’t tried to make things difficult for Leng Xiaoyao, Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t have retorted like that.

Before long, they arrived at the No.1 High School. Many students and teachers from other high schools were also present.

Once Leng Xiaoyao and the others got out of the car, they heard an unkind male voice. “Oh, isn’t this Mr. Chen? Why do these two students show up at every competition? Don’t you have other students in your school?”

The man was in his early thirties. He came with three excellent students from No.2 High school.

Mr. Chen was annoyed. Although Gao Qilu and Qin Siyuan weren’t the best students in their school, they had rich experience and had won their own prizes before.

There were students who had higher scores than them, but those students couldn’t stay calm at a competition nor could they do their best. As a result, they didn’t come. After all, they had a test in their school before coming.

“Mr. Yang, I don’t think you came here with different students either.” Mr. Chen argued.

Mr. Yang didn’t care about that. “Mu Sihang was the champion last year, so he must come, but the other two students have rarely taken part in the competition before.”

Mr. Yang deliberately emphasized the word champion. Obviously, he was showing off.

Although the Liberal Arts Defense was held once every year, the High School General Knowledge Competition was held three times a year. It was mainly a single subject competition.

Last time, it was a competition about Language Y and Mu Sihang was the champion.

When Mr. Yang mentioned Mu Sihang, Mu Sihang looked arrogant and didn’t take Leng Xiaoyao as well as the others seriously at all. That angered Mr. Chen.

“It means that all of them have experience.” Mr. Chen argued.

“You’re right.” Mr. Yang didn’t care about that and continued. “But your school is famous for students of high quality. If you can’t win the championship again, I’m afraid your reputation will be damaged.”

Mr. Chen was embarrassed.

For several years, their school failed to win the championship, so its reputation was indeed damaged a little. It wasn’t serious, but it was upsetting.

However, they couldn’t blame anybody for that. After all, the students from other schools were really better and their representatives also did their best. It wasn’t their fault that they failed.

At this moment, Leng Xiaoyao smiled and said, “Mr. Yang, do you have confidence to win this time?”

Mr. Yang and his students turned to look at Leng Xiaoyao and were amazed by her beauty.

Leng Xiaoyao stood behind Mr. Yang, so they didn’t see her until then.

Among Mr. Yang’s three students, there was a girl. The moment she saw Leng Xiaoyao, she was amazed yet jealous.

Leng Xiaoyao had the same intention as when Gao Qilu tested her earlier. If they said yes, they would be embarrassed if they couldn’t win the championship.

If they won, it wouldn’t be a problem.

However, if they denied it, nothing would happen.

As soon as Leng Xiaoyao finished speaking, Gao Qilu opened her mouth before Mr. Yang could say anything. “Leng Xiaoyao, that’s too much. Mr. Yang only said that Mu Sihang was the champion last time. Mr. Yang didn’t say that Mu Sihang will be the champion again. If he says yes to your question, will you say that he’s too arrogant? If he fails to win the championship, he’ll be embarrassed. If he denies it, will you criticize him for not being confident?”

Gao Qilu looked at Leng Xiaoyao mockingly. She wanted to see how Leng Xiaoyao would reply to the same question.

Gao Qilu was mad at Leng Xiaoyao for embarrassing her earlier.

Leng Xiaoyao sneered and felt that Gao Qilu was too stupid.

Mr. Chen had a big frown. Gao Qilu was indeed stupid. How could she make things difficult for her schoolmates right in front of the teacher and students from another school?

Besides, why did Leng Xiaoyao say so much about that? However, Mr. Chen couldn’t criticize Leng Xiaoyao because she was defending their school.

Different people had different thoughts. Mr. Yang didn’t think that Gao Qilu was picking on Leng Xiaoyao. Instead, he believed that they were working together to make fun of him. He was immediately angry and said, “Yes, we have confidence to win the championship! So what? You’ve never won the championship anyway!”

“Mr. Yang is right. We’ll see you win the championship then!” Leng Xiaoyao said in a louder voice which immediately attracted many people’s attention. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Many people heard the end of their conversation, so they disdained the No.2 High School. They were so arrogant that they claimed that they would win the championship even before the competition began. Weren’t they afraid that they would end up being a joke in the end?
