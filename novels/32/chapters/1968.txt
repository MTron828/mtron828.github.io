Chapter 1969: Master’s Order

However, the case was very strange this time, so Leng Shaoting took the initiative to deal with it.

Two 13-year-old girls disappeared out of the blue. When they were retrieved, their bodies were withered as if they had been drained of blood.

Only vampires or people of the Evil Practice could suck all the blood out of a human body.

For now, only Leng Shaoting could handle such strange things. After his investigation, he made sure it was done by men of the Evil Practice, while the two victims were girls who were born on a lunar date. They were used to nourish men of the Evil Practice for their cultivation.

Men of the Evil Practice needed a quiet place to cultivate after sucking the blood of girls who were born on a lunar date, so Leng Shaoting knew the man didn’t run far away and must be hiding in the surrounding mountains. Nevertheless, it wasn’t easy to find the man even if he knew the man was right in the mountains.

Luckily, he had the flood dragon’s help, so it wasn’t very difficult. Once the flood dragon was out, it could quickly search the nearby mountains. As long as the man wasn’t at a very high level, it could sense him within 200 meters.

With the flood dragon’s help, Leng Shaoting became more efficient at his work, so he felt very grateful to Gu Ning.

When the sky turned dark, Leng Shaoting let the flood dragon out to do its job. He told the flood dragon to kill the man of the Evil Practice if it encountered him. It could report to him afterwards.

Leng Shaoting didn’t want the man of the Evil Practice to run away before he found him. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

In just an hour, the flood dragon finished searching the mountains within a radius of 10 kilometers. In a remote mountain 10 kilometers away from where Leng Shaoting and others rested, it found the man of the Evil Practice. At this moment, he was in a cave.

Because Leng Shaoting gave the flood dragon an order that it should kill the man once it found him, the flood dragon took action the moment it saw the man.

The man of the Evil Practice was at a high level, but the flood dragon was even better than him. Therefore, the flood dragon was able to find him from 100 meters away, while the man didn’t notice it until it was close.

Before the flood dragon became a real dragon, it was a monster, so it had an air of a monster. So feeling the aura of a monster, the man stiffened in his cultivation. He became alert at once and stopped cultivating right away.

Even though he should avoid being interrupted or stopping the cultivation halfway, he was reaching the end of the cultivation this time. He would be affected to some extent, but it wasn’t serious. However, if he continued to cultivate and ignored the approaching monster, he would be in danger.

The man forced himself to stop and spat out a mouthful of blood after tasting the fishy smell in his throat. His body was slightly damaged, but luckily his abilities weren’t greatly affected.

The man of the Evil Practice was angry with the monster that appeared suddenly, but there was nothing he could do. In such remote mountains, it was unavoidable to run into monsters, but he had quite bad luck today.

Anyway, since the monster was here, he decided to absorb its energy.

That was the idea of the man of the Evil Practice before seeing the flood dragon, but he suddenly became vigilant when he saw the flood dragon. He could feel that the flood dragon’s level wasn’t low, and it might be much stronger than him.

Although he didn’t think he was no match for it just because of that, he was unwilling to risk his life. However, since it was a flood dragon, why wasn’t it in the water? Why was it in the remote mountains?

“May I know why you’re here?” asked the man.

“To kill you,” said the flood dragon.

Hearing that, a touch of cruelty flashed in the man’s eyes. He asked, “Why? Do we have any grudges?”

“It’s my master’s order,” said the flood dragon.

“Who’s your master?” asked the man.

“You don’t need to know, but I can tell you why you’re going to be killed today. It’s because you’ve killed two girls who were born on a lunar date,” said the flood dragon, then it directly attacked the man.

“What?” Hearing that, the man was greatly surprised. He didn’t expect that his bad luck today was because of the two girls who were born on a lunar date.

Before he could think or ask further about it, the flood dragon attacked him, so he had to fight back at once.

Because both of them had magical skills, they caused a lot of damage and the cave was soon destroyed in the fight. Fortunately, this place was far away from people, and no one could see them.

At the beginning, it was a draw, but soon the man was at a disadvantage.

“Please, can you let me go this time? I promise I’ll never hurt anyone again.” The man was scared and gave in. As long as he could survive, he didn’t care to beg for mercy.

“No,” said the flood dragon.

“You…” the man was mad and felt hopeless, because he was no match for the flood dragon. It was impossible for him to escape.

In the end, the man’s energy core was completely ruined by the flood dragon and he was swallowed by it.

After that, the flood dragon went back to Leng Shaoting’s side and told him that the man was already killed.

Because more and more strange things were happening nowadays, Leng Shaoting decided to report it to the president after he went back.

The task was done, but he couldn’t go back to his team right now. He needed to deal with the follow-ups, because the scary news had caused a lot of horror.

…

In the morning, Gu Ning and her friends went to run at the playground. After running for a while, Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue noticed that someone was following them.

Although there were many people running and some were behind them, there was a difference between someone following them and people running together. Gu Ning also felt someone kept staring at her body.

She knew someone was following her, but couldn’t directly turn around to see who the person was, so she didn’t know who was behind her.

Before long, someone called her from behind.

“Gu Ning!”

It was a male voice. Hearing that, Gu Ning turned around and saw the person. She remained expressionless, but was a little surprised.

The person was the foreign teacher she had rescued the night before yesterday. He was called Owen.

Gu Ning was slightly surprised because she thought he might have learned that she had rescued him since he came to see her. If not, he wouldn’t stop her.

Even though Gu Ning was a little surprised, she didn’t think it was a big deal that Owen learned about it. After all, as long as he went to see the surveillance videos, he would know it was her. She was the only one who entered the school at that time.

“Hi, Owen!” Gu Ning calmly greeted him.

“Gu Ning, can we have a private talk?” asked Owen. Although he was from Country Y, he spoke the local language.

“Sure,” said Gu Ning, then she told Song Miaoge and the other girls to keep running and she stopped.

They all knew Gu Ning was very strong, so they weren’t worried about her safety and continued to run ahead.
