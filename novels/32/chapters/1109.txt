Chapter 1110 Qi Ziyue Calls

“The Future Queen? Come on, you’re already a queen right now,” K joked.“Well, I’ll be a real queen when I become the richest businesswoman in this country,” Gu Ning said with a serious expression.

She didn’t bother to hide her ambition from her close friends.

Although it sounded very ambitious, K didn’t think that it was impossible because he believed in Gu Ning.

Nobody knew what would happen in the future, but Gu Ning was always outstanding among her peers. She already became a billionaire at such an early stage, and it was very likely that she could be even more successful in the future.

“Great, the Future Queen!” K laughed.

Afterwards, Gu Ning began to choose her role in the game, and she picked a killer.

“You can get familiar with the buttons first, then we can have two teams to play a round together later,” K said.

“Sure,” Gu Ning said.

There was a simulated battle for beginners in the game. Although the virtual opponent wasn’t very skillful, it was still challenging for beginners.

Gu Ning played the simulated battle for beginners for a while, and it only took a few minutes for her to get familiar with the rules and buttons.

“Alright, I’m ready for the real battle,” Gu Ning said.

“Really?” K was surprised. He knew that Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl, but it was still surprising that she could play the game well within a few minutes.

Since Gu Ning said she was ready, he agreed to have the battle now.

K then said to his colleagues, “Everyone, attention please. Now we can have a round of the new game to help our boss get more familiar with it.”

“Sure,” the others said.

They stopped working and took out their phones at once.

They were all excellent players, and couldn’t be more familiar with the game.

Except for K, there were eight people, and they were divided into two teams. Every one of them needed to gain experience and fight against each other at the same time.

The seven of them used their junior game IDs to play with Gu Ning, because Gu Ning was a beginner.

Although they used their junior game IDs, they were actually senior game players, so they were definitely much better than Gu Ning when it came to the skills.

At the beginning, Gu Ning could barely win, but she improved her skills at a shocking pace.

The others all believed that she was a game genius. They totally devoted themselves to the game, and really enjoyed it.

Within a morning, Gu Ning grew to be Primary Level 20 from a beginner.

The game was divided into seven grades: primary grade, intermediate grade, advanced grade, god grade, holy grade, heaven grade and infinite grade. Each grade had 100 levels.

Therefore, although Primary Level 20 was still a very low level in the game, it normally took about a week for a beginner to reach it. However, Gu Ning only used a morning, which was amazing.

“Wow, boss, you’re so unbelievable!”

“I can’t believe it!”

“Boss, how did you do that?”

“Boss...”

They kept complimenting and asking Gu Ning questions.

“Well, I guess it’s a gift,” Gu Ning said.

The others agreed.

“When will this game be released?” Gu Ning asked.

“In about three or four days,” K said.

“Great, I probably won’t be in the capital after several days, so I’m afraid I can’t show up at the news conference. I’ll think of a better way to promote it,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure,” K said.

...

Gu Ning planned to have lunch at the cafeteria of her company later, but she received Qi Ziyue’s call all of a sudden.

She grimaced when she saw the caller’s name.

“Hi!” Gu Ning picked it up.

“Hi, Miss Tang, this is Qi Ziyue. Are you free today? We can go to visit Aining now,” Qi Ziyue said.

“Sure, where and when?” Gu Ning asked.

Qi Ziyue must have set a trap for her, but Gu Ning wasn’t afraid at all.

“How about 2 pm? No. 67, XX Villa District, XX Road,” Qi Ziyue said. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“No problem, I’ll be there,” Gu Ning said, then left.

It was almost 12 pm, so she decided to have a simple meal outside. The capital was very large with too much traffic, and the place Qi Ziyue told her was a little far away so she didn’t have much time.

When Gu Ning just walked out of an elevator, she ran into Ba Tianyang, who came back with a lunchbox.

Ba Tianyang’s eyes lit up the second he saw Gu Ning. “Hi, boss, nice to see you!”

“Hi, how are you? Do you like your work here?” Gu Ning asked him with concern.

“Of course,” Ba Tianyang said. In fact, he had never lived such a full life before. He used to be a killer and lived a cruel life. He kept chasing and killing his targets, and he could be killed at any second too.
