Chapter 1864: It Has Nothing to Do with You.

Zhou Renyu also reported the previous night’s case to his leader that morning, and showed the leader the video recorded by Gu Ning and the report from interrogating the suspects.

As for whether this crime had anything to do with Qu Linan, some felt that Qu Linan had played a role, while some believed that someone had framed Qu Linan. No matter what, since the suspects finally said that it had nothing to do with Qu Linan, then the police wouldn’t bother to arrest him.

Anyway, the criminals were already arrested, so they could settle the case. Therefore, the police handed those criminals to the court for the sentence. However, it would take time for the final result to come out.

...

When their classes were over at noon, Gu Ning went to the canteen alone. Because she studied in a different department from Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue, their classrooms were in different teaching buildings and they could only dine together in the canteen.

Unexpectedly, Gu Ning met Qu Hanjiao under the teaching building because she was also a student of the economics department.

Qu Hanjiao was displeased to see Gu Ning, but she didn’t dare to have any more conflict with Gu Ning after thinking of her older brother’s exhortation.

When Gu Ning saw Qu Hanjiao, however, she put on a fake smile with a meaningful look, which made Qu Hanjiao feel quite uneasy and panicked.

She originally didn’t think that Gu Ning knew that what had happened yesterday had something to do with her, but she now somehow felt that Gu Ning was aware of it.

Her older brother had told her that Gu Ning was very influential, so Qu Hanjiao was worried that Gu Ning found out that she had played a role in what had happened yesterday and wanted to pay her back. Thinking of that, Qu Hanjiao immediately turned around walking away.

Gu Ning then walked to her in a hurry and said gently, “If you don’t want anyone to know, never do it. Qu Hanjiao, you’ll pay for what you’ve done one day. The day will come soon.”

Hearing that, Qu Hanjiao was scared and stopped for a second, feeling uncomfortable.

Gu Ning’s words showed that she knew Qu Hanjiao had something to do with what had happened yesterday.

Afterwards, Gu Ning directly walked by Qu Hanjiao and left her behind.

Watching Gu Ning walking away, Qu Hanjiao felt angry at being threatened, but she was frightened at the same time.

However, did Gu Ning really dare to pay her back? She refused to believe it.

Qu Hanjiao didn’t believe that Gu Ning would really do something to her, but she was worried as well.

Therefore, when Qu Hanjiao went to the canteen and dined with Yuan Shuyan and Ge Qingqing, she lost her appetite and didn’t enjoy the meal at all.

“Jiaojiao, what’s wrong? Are you still in a bad mood because of what happened yesterday?” asked Ge Qingqing with concern.

“Well,” Qu Hanjiao sighed, then told them that she had met Gu Ning just now, so she was worried.

Hearing that, Yuan Shuyan and Ge Qingqing both frowned. Ge Qingqing said, “Do you mean that Gu Ning has found out that you played a role in what happened yesterday?”

“Obviously she knows, but I don’t think that she dares to do anything to you. No matter how influential she is, she can’t compete with the Qu family,” said Yuan Shuyan. All in all, Yuan Shuyan had too much confidence in their family background.

She had that feeling for a reason, because ordinary people really didn’t dare to act against people of power.

Nevertheless, Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary person, so she had nothing to be afraid of.

“I hope so!” Qu Hanjiao had the same idea, but she couldn’t help being worried, because Gu Ning told her face to face that she would pay for what she had done one day and the day would come soon.

All of a sudden, Qu Hanjiao saw Gu Ning sitting not far from them, and she looked displeased at once.

“What’s wrong?”

Both Yuan Shuyan and Ge Qingqing noticed the change of her expression and looked in the direction of her sight.

The next second, they saw Gu Ning too, and Yuan Shuyan became unhappy as well.

Ge Qingqing was fine, because Yuan Shuyan and Qu Hanjiao disliked Gu Ning, while she didn’t have any conflict with Gu Ning. Therefore, she stayed calm when she saw Gu Ning.

“Well, enemies always cross each other’s path,” Ge Qingqing mumbled.

Because they were annoyed to see Gu Ning, they moved their sight away from her right away. Unfortunately, right at this moment, they saw Rong Zechen along with another three students walking towards Gu Ning.

Yuan Shuyan and her friends noticed the obvious happiness on Rong Zechen’s face when he saw Gu Ning.

In an instant, Yuan Shuyan became even more displeased and tightened her hands around her chopsticks.

“Senior Rong is walking to Gu Ning!” Qu Hanjiao said in annoyance as if she was arguing for Yuan Shuyan, but she actually also felt annoyed.

Rong Zechen and the other three students walked to Gu Ning’s table and greeted her with enthusiasm. “What a coincidence, Gu Ning!”

Because Rong Zechen was excited to see Gu Ning, he even ignored Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue. Luckily, they didn’t mind. Since he didn’t say hello to them, they naturally said nothing.

“Hi, Senior Rong,” said Gu Ning, staying calm, then continued to eat.

Rong Zechen didn’t think it was wrong, but his friends were dissatisfied with Gu Ning’s attitude.

They knew that Gu Ning was rich and outstanding, but she wasn’t comparable to Rong Zechen at all. How did she dare to be so cool to Rong Zechen?

Therefore, a boy who disliked Gu Ning’s attitude opened his mouth and said with dissatisfaction, “Gu Ning, do you think you’re superior to other people only because you’ve got some achievements? Zechen just greeted you very kindly. Look at your cold attitude!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Chuanxun, mind your words!” Rong Zechen snapped at him at once. In case Gu Ning was mad, he explained at once. “Gu Ning, I’m sorry, my friend doesn’t mean it.”

“You know he said that on purpose!” Gu Ning was displeased. She gave a cool glance at Rong Zechen, then Wei Chuanxun. “My achievements and my attitude are my own business. It has nothing to do with you. Who are you?” She questioned him.

Gu Ning understood Wei Chuanxun’s meaning very well. He simply thought that Rong Zechen had a powerful family, while she was merely nobody.

In fact, those kids who were born in powerful families really believed that they were more outstanding than people who earned everything on their own.

For this practical society, people from powerful families indeed enjoyed a higher position than other people, and they also easily won countless people’s respect and admiration. Gu Ning, however, was an exception.
