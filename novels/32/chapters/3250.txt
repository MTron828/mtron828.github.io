3252 I Have Good Luck!

“I don’t mind,” said Li Mochen. It was the truth, but he was a little upset when Leng Xiaoyao said that.

After what had happened earlier, they weren’t as depressed as before.

Li Mochen sent Leng Xiaoyao back to the Leng family’s mansion in City Chang. Then he immediately flew back to City Qin.

Although it wasted a lot of time and money by sending Leng Xiaoyao home, he was happy to do it.

…

When Leng Xiaoyao got back to the Leng family’s mansion, it was about 5 pm. Because it was Sunday today, the other family members were also home. Leng Yuchen was home too and they were in the living room.

Leng Xiaoyao was absent, so Leng Changyuan wasn’t in a good mood. Even if Leng Yuchen was chatting with him, he still had an absent expression.

As a result, Leng Yuchen was very unhappy, but he didn’t show it in front of Leng Changyuan.

Leng Yuchen didn’t understand it. In many other families, they usually valued boys over girls. However, in the Leng family, Leng Changyuan cared more about Leng Xiaoyao, who was going to marry into another family sooner or later, than him who was the Leng family’s grandson.

He would be a member of the Leng family forever, whereas Leng Xiaoyao would leave.

In fact, Leng Changyuan treated Leng Yuchen very well. However, the treatment he received wasn’t comparable to what Leng Xiaoyao received. After all, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t have a mother, so Leng Changyuan needed to take care of her.

Even if Leng Changyuan didn’t focus, Leng Yuchen still continued to talk with him. He simply wanted to be close to him.

At that time, Leng Changyuan suddenly heard Leng Xiaoyao’s voice from outside. He was excited and immediately stood up leaving Leng Yuchen, who was still talking to him, at the side. Leng Yuchen was embarrassed, and so were his parents.

“Yaoyao is home. How was your day?” asked Leng Changyuan with a beaming smile.

“It was very pleasant.” Leng Xiaoyao also smiled. “I have a gift for you!”

She carried a paper box about twenty inches long. It contained the wild ginseng and reishi mushrooms that she had found on the Island of Bones.

“What is it?” asked Leng Changyuan.

“You’ll know after you open it,” Leng Xiaoyao said with a mysterious smile.

“Is it heavy?” asked Leng Changyuan. The box was big, so he was afraid that it was too heavy for Leng Xiaoyao to carry. Before Leng Xiaoyao said anything, Leng Changyuan snapped at Leng Yecheng next to him. “Are you blind? Take the box from Yaoyao’s hand already.”

“It’s not heavy. It’s very light,” Leng Xiaoyao said at once.

However, Leng Yecheng still took the box from Leng Xiaoyao’s hand. Even if he knew that she could carry it, he didn’t want to be criticized by Leng Changyuan again.

Leng Yecheng was more than willing to do that, but he still complained to himself that his father totally forgot that Leng Xiaoyao was able to carry a large stone of over fifty kilograms, whereas he just recovered from his injuries!

Anyway, Master Leng cared about Leng Xiaoyao very much, so he had to bear it. Luckily, this box was indeed light, or he might have gotten injured again.

Upon hearing that Leng Xiaoyao brought a gift for Leng Changyuan, everyone was curious about it. After knowing that Leng Xiaoyao sent Leng Changyuan jade last time, they didn’t dare to disdain her again. Without delay, they moved closer.

Even before seeing the gift, Song Meiyu and Leng Yuqi got jealous because they knew that it couldn’t be bad.

Leng Yecheng put the box down on the ground, then opened it with a knife.

The things inside were all packed, so they saw many small wooden boxes after the box was opened.

Without hesitation, Leng Changyuan opened them on his own.

After seeing reishi mushrooms in those wooden boxes, everyone was surprised.

The others knew little about reishi mushrooms, but Leng Changyuan knew a bit. He could tell the age of these reishi mushrooms at a glance. They were obviously very valuable.

Leng Changyuan was surprised and excited. No one would dislike valuable things.

“Do these wooden boxes all contain reishi mushrooms?” Leng Yecheng asked, opening another one. There were indeed reishi mushrooms.

“Yaoyao, did you buy them?” asked Leng Changyuan. If that was the case, it must have been very expensive. Nevertheless, he was still very happy to receive a gift from Leng Xiaoyao. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Not at all. I found them on a mountain,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Your luck is extremely good!” Leng Yecheng exclaimed. He believed Leng Xiaoyao’s words because he knew she had the ability.

Leng Changyuan agreed with him.

Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng didn’t doubt it, but the others couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t easy to find reishi mushrooms!

Therefore, Song Meiyu said, “Is it so easy to find reishi mushrooms? Where did you find them?”

“I have good luck!” Leng Xiaoyao gave a perfunctory answer.

Song Meiyu was struck dumb for a second, then stopped speaking.

Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng continued to open the boxes. In addition to the reishi mushrooms, they also saw wild ginseng, surprising them again.

The wild ginseng wasn’t small at all, so it must be very old.

“Yaoyao, d-did you find this wild ginseng from a mountain too? It must have grown for many years!” Leng Changyuan was so excited that his hands were shaking a little.

“Yes, this wild ginseng should be over five hundred years old. I think it’s about to take on the shape of a human being. When I dug it out, it tried to run away, but I caught it at once,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Hearing that, everyone gasped in shock.

It was said that wild ginseng could run, but no one had seen it before. Therefore, nobody was sure whether it was true. Anyway, as the news spread, some people were convinced to some extent.

Accordingly, they were willing to believe it even though it was still quite shocking.

Moreover, this wild ginseng was over five hundred years old. It should be worth several million yuan!

It was true that wild ginseng of over five hundred years old would be worth at least five million yuan.

Song Meiyu’s family was envious, especially Song Meiyu and Leng Yuqi.

Why was Leng Xiaoyao so lucky?

“Can wild ginseng really run?” Leng Changyuan asked in surprise.

“Yeah! That’s why people tie it up with red threads, so that it can’t escape,” Leng Xiaoyao said. It was true, but only ginseng that was hundreds of years old could run.

If any random ginseng could run, it would be much harder to catch ginseng.

In that case, everyone believed it. It was true that precious ginseng was always tied up to prevent it from running away.

“Is there more wild ginseng?” asked Song Meiyu acidly. She was unwilling to believe it, because what was shown already filled her with jealousy. If there was more, she didn’t know how to live!
