3216 How Dare You Say I’m Dumb?

His mother even disliked him, so it was impossible for her to like his wife.

After Wang Yiming’s wife received the call, she rushed over.

Wang Xiangyang, on the other hand, was mad that Wang Yiming hung up on him. He immediately complained about it to his mother. “Mom, Wang Yiming hung up on me. He doesn’t care about you at all.”

“Perhaps he really had a car accident. If so, he might be heart-broken because of your words. What if he won’t help us again? Let me call him first.” Old Mrs. Wang didn’t think that Wang Yiming would deliberately lie to them. She was afraid that Wang Yiming might be hurt deeply by Wang Xiangyang’s words. After all, she still hoped that Wang Yiming could support them!

“No matter what, he’s your son. He must listen to you,” Wang Xiangyang said airily. He believed that Wang Yiming should serve them.

“Then we must keep it a secret that he isn’t my biological son. If he finds out, he won’t listen to me any longer.” Old Mrs. Wang said.

Wang Yiming was raised by her, so she clearly knew his character. He was a filial child, but he wasn’t dumb. They couldn’t get everything they wanted from him.

If he learned that he wasn’t her biological son, he might cut off their relationship.

“No one will know it if we keep it between us. Anyway, my father is already dead. Even if he isn’t your biological son, he might be our father’s biological son. You raised him, so he should take care of you,” Wang Xiangyang said. In his eyes, it was Wang Yiming’s duty to look after Old Mrs. Wang.

However, they forgot that Wang Yiming was very independent ever since he was little even though they lived together. Old Mrs. Wang did nothing and only Old Mr. Wang took care of Wang Yiming.

“Alright, stop being harsh. Let me call him now.” Old Mrs. Wang snapped at Wang Xiangyang. Wang Xiangyang curled his lips and said nothing else. Old Mrs. Wang immediately called Wang Yiming.

Wang Yiming answered it at once, but he directly told them his situation.

Old Mrs. Wang didn’t doubt it. She only asked him to tell them which hospital and ward he was in. They could go to see him tomorrow. Today she needed Wang Xiangyang’s care and couldn’t go out.

Wang Yiming understood that they wanted to come and see him to make sure whether he was really hospitalized.

Anyway, if they wanted to check, he could let them do that. Therefore, he agreed, but felt hurt even more than ever.

In fact, if Old Mrs. Wang wasn’t his biological mother, he wouldn’t have yielded to her again and again.

Wang Yiming was burdened and hurt by his familial relationships.

An ambulance quickly arrived and Wang Yiming and the truck driver were sent to the hospital.

The truck driver was slightly injured.

As for the car, they left it to the traffic police. Wang Yiming would deal with it when he recovered.

At the hospital.

Wang Yiming had a medical check up and was sure that he was only slightly injured. Even the doctor had to exclaim that it was a miracle. Wang Yiming’s wife felt they were extremely lucky that Wang Yiming was fine. However, what they didn’t know was that it was Leng Xiaoyao’s credit that Wang Yiming could survive.

Although he was injured only slightly, he still needed to stay in the hospital for a while. After all, he needed to deal with his surface injuries. Without delay, Wang Yiming called the principal and asked that Leng Xiaoyao teach his class.

Therefore, the principal went to Class 8 to see Leng Xiaoyao. He told Leng Xiaoyao that Wang Yiming had been in a car accident and that he wanted her to teach his class.

Because it wasn’t beyond Leng Xiaoyao’s expectation that Wang Yiming would encounter an accident, she wasn’t surprised and understood that her talisman saved his life.

Leng Xiaoyao asked the principal about Wang Yiming’s condition. After finding out that he was fine, she was relieved. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Knowing that Wang Yiming encountered a car accident, all the students said that they wanted to see him in the hospital. However, because there couldn’t be too many people, they decided to choose five representatives in the end.

Leng Xiaoyao, the class leader, the deputy class leader, the commissary in charge of studies and the math class representative would represent Class 8.

The students also voluntarily donated to Wang Yiming. Even if they were students and didn’t have much money, they were willing to help. After all, they couldn’t go to see their teacher with empty hands.

However, all the students in Class 8 were accepted by their school through connections. They were either from rich or powerful families, so most of them donated several hundred yuan.

All the money was kept by Leng Xiaoyao. Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to upset them so she agreed to do that.

Finally, they donated about twelve thousand yuan. Leng Xiaoyao also joined them and donated three hundred.

The next day, when the morning classes were over, the student representatives went to the hospital.

However, right when they were outside the ward, they heard Wang Yiming’s angry shouts.

“Wang Xiangyang, do you really take me as a family member? I’m injured and I’m in the hospital now. I badly need money. How can you ask me for money at this moment? Do you want me to be kicked out by the hospital?” Wang Yiming was furious. He thought that Wang Xiangyang only came to see whether he was really injured. However, he actually came to ask him for money.

“You don’t need to take responsibility for the car accident. The man who knocked into you will pay for your medical fees. You don’t need to pay by yourself,” Wang Xiangyang said, taking it for granted.

“Are you an idiot? The man who knocked into me should take the responsibility, but it’s not been investigated yet, so I need to pay for it on my own. After it’s done, the man will pay me back,” Wang Yiming said in anger. Sometimes, he honestly felt that Wang Xiangyang couldn’t think normally and had no common sense.

He was spoiled by Old Mrs. Wang, so he was reckless and impulsive especially with Wang Yiming.

If there was an outsider, he might behave. However, he only dared to bully the weak.

Wang Yiming was so used to being bullied by them, so they weren’t afraid of him at all.

“How dare you say I’m dumb! Mom is in the hospital. Don’t you care about her at all? I don’t have any money,” Wang Xiangyang said, pretending that he was totally innocent.

“Why do I have to deal with everything? What did you do? I’m not the only son of our mother. I can barely take care of myself right now. How could I look after her? I’ve done a lot for you. What did you ever do for me? You ask everything from me and never care about me. Do you want to deprive everything from me?” Wang Yiming finally lost his temper. He didn’t care that there were other people in the ward.
