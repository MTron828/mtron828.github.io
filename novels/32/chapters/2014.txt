Chapter 2016: Freeze Them Temporarily

“Sure.” Gu Ning didn’t reject it. Although she didn’t know which family Mo Qilin was from in the cultivation world, he didn’t aim to hurt her anyway. In addition, she had a good impression of him at their first meeting, so it wasn’t a big deal to make friends with him.

In fact, not every cultivator tried to hurt her. For example, Baili Zongyang and his younger sister hoped to build a good relationship with her without an evil purpose, so she was willing to spend time with them. However, it depended on her how they would get along with each other.

Gu Ning took out her name card and handed it to Mo Qilin.

“Thanks.” Mo Qilin showed excitement at once and took her name card. “I don’t have name cards. I’ll send you a message later.”

“Of course,” said Gu Ning. She didn’t stay there for much longer before she left.

Mo Qilin watched Gu Ning’s car disappear from sight before walking away.

…

Kato Toya and Kuraki Akemi were in a bad mood when they left. They felt quite unhappy, because they failed to figure out whether the teenager was a real cultivator.

They had the idea to leave for a while, then go back once Gu Ning was gone to find the teenager, but they didn’t think it was a good idea after thinking about it carefully. If they went back again, it would prove that they deliberately caused the teenager trouble.

In that case, their purpose would be exposed, and it might drag themselves into trouble if the leaders of the country found them.

All in all, they blamed Gu Ning for everything. If it hadn’t been for her, they could have already figured out the teenager’s real identity. After all, they only wanted to know whether he was a real cultivator. They had no intention of hurting him. Even if they were going to hurt him, they wouldn’t do that in public.

Nevertheless, it was useless even though they blamed Gu Ning for it, because they were no match for her. They couldn’t expose their real identity just to pay Gu Ning back. As a result, they had to give up for the time being.

Because of the accident on the way, Gu Ning didn’t arrive at the siheyuan until 6:30 pm. Gu Ning called Shangguan Yang and told them to eat before she got there, but Shangguan Yang decided to wait for her. It wasn’t that late anyway, and they weren’t hungry. They could have dinner at 7 pm.

Therefore, they had the meal together after Gu Ning came.

During the meal, Gu Ning talked about what she had encountered earlier with Shangguan Yang and Jing Yunyao. After hearing her account, both of them had a little frown.

“It’s obvious that the two ninjas found something special about Mo Qilin. It aroused their curiosity, but they weren’t sure about it, so they tried to test his skills,” said Shangguan Yang.

“You’ve successfully stopped them this time, but they could meet again,” said Jing Yunyao with worries.

Jing Yunyao didn’t care much about the society’s safety, but Leng Shaoting was in charge of that right now, so she was worried that it might cause Leng Shaoting trouble.

“Well, I guess I can do nothing about that. We’re running out of steam. We can only do our best to solve the problems no matter what happens in the future. Kato Toya and Kuraki Akemi are in the capital now. They’ll run into cultivators sooner or later, so we must stop them from hanging around now,” said Gu Ning. She had an idea to deal with the ninjas.

“What do you plan to do?” asked Shangguan Yang and Jing Yunyao with one accord.

“Although they’re spies from Country R, we can’t kill them for no reason. I can freeze their bodies and make them lie in the hospital for a few days. At least they can’t continue to look for cultivators when we’re in the capital,” said Gu Ning.

There was no grudge between them, but they were spies from Country R! Even if Gu Ning didn’t kill them, she would certainly make them suffer.

“I think it’s a good idea.” Shangguan Yang agreed at once. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Me too.” Jing Yunyao agreed. It was a good thing that they could stop the spies from doing any activities.

“I’ll tell my subordinate to find out where they stay. I’ll take action after I finish eating,” said Gu Ning, then she immediately called K and told him the section of the road where the accident happened. Afterwards, she told K to track where Kato Toya and Kuraki Akemi went through surveillance cameras.

“May I help?” asked Jing Yunyao. She knew Gu Ning was able to handle it, but she still asked that question out of concern.

“No need, I can deal with it. It’s easy.” Gu Ning declined. “There are more and more cultivators in the capital now. You must be careful.”

Jing Yunyao didn’t insist, but still reminded Gu Ning to be careful.

In 10 minutes, K replied to Gu Ning, telling her that Kato Toya and Kuraki Akemi left for XX restaurant. They were dining in No.333 private room at this moment. In addition to them, there were two other young men inside the room.

Gu Ning finished eating, so she moved once she received the message. She told K to keep on watching them. If they left, he had to let her know.

K would stop watching them when she told him to stop.

Because Kato Toya and Kuraki Akemi had seen her car today, she drove Shangguan Yang’s exclusive car in case she was exposed. Moreover, Gu Ning also changed her clothes and put on a baseball cap along with sunglasses so that they couldn’t recognize her.

Because they were all in the eastern district, Gu Ning arrived at XX restaurant in about 20 minutes.

By the time Gu Ning arrived, K still hadn’t told her that they had left, which meant they were still in the room.

Gu Ning gave K a call to make sure of it, then told K to stop watching them.

K never asked further about what Gu Ning was going to do.

Gu Ning stopped the car in the parking lot outside the restaurant, but she didn’t get out of it, because she decided to wait for a while.

If she went to quietly stand outside the private room where Kato Toya and Kuraki Akemi stayed and even stared straight at the wall for a while, the waiters would soon find out that something wasn’t right, which would cause unnecessary trouble.

Besides, there were other people in the private room, and innocent people would be hurt as well if she released magical power and it spread around. Therefore, she could only wait for a better chance to take action after they went out.

Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see the inside once in a while in case they went directly to the underground parking lot by elevator.

After about 20 minutes, Kato Toya and Kuraki Akemi came out.

They talked with their companions for a while at the entrance of the restaurant, then waved each other good-bye. The two men walked towards another direction, while Kato Toya and Kuraki Akemi coincidentally walked towards Gu Ning.

Gu Ning didn’t think they saw her, but believed their car must be stopped here as well, because their sight never fell on her, but they still walked towards her direction.
