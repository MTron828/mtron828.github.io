Chapter 2196: I Can Tell You Then!

“Yeah, I know what you want to know, Miss Dongfang. The plants here have something different. I don’t know what it is, but I do know it attracts you here. This isn’t the first time that you’ve come to see me. You’ve already visited Colaine,” said Gu Ning. She knew their intention, but wasn’t mad.

Hearing that, Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua stayed calm, because they knew they came here to see Gu Ning for the magical power. They were also aware that Gu Ning wasn’t dumb, so she must know their purpose.

“Miss Gu, can you tell us what you add to Colaine medicines and these plants?” Dongfang Ziyu asked, but didn’t have hopes.

However, Gu Ning chose to be honest with them this time.

“Well, I’m so bothered these days when people won’t stop spying on and investigating me. Let me tell you then! I told you before that I added a substance that isn’t recorded in the formula to the medicines. The plants in my shop are also watered with that substance. If you ask me what the substance is called, I don’t know either, but I can tell you who gave it to me,” said Gu Ning.

“Really?” Hearing that, Dongfang Ziyu’s and Wu Shunhua’s eyes lit up. They were greatly surprised that Gu Ning was willing to tell them now. However, since Gu Ning was willing to tell them right now, she must have told other people about it too. Thinking of that, they were less excited, but it was better to know the answer.

“It’s a senior called Shangguan. He only told me the substance can greatly improve the effects of medicines. If plants are watered with it, they could grow to be more vital and attractive,” said Gu Ning.

“Senior Shangguan…”

Knowing that, both Wu Shunhua and Dongfang Ziyu were shocked. To their surprise, it turned out to be Senior Shangguan.

In an instant, Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua were disappointed, because they didn’t dare to mess with Shangguan Yang at all.

“Do you know Senior Shangguan as well?” Gu Ning acted surprised.

“We were honored to meet him once,” said Dongfang Ziyu.

“Thank you so much for your answer, Miss Gu. See you.” Since they had the answer, Dongfang Ziyu felt they should leave.

They didn’t doubt Gu Ning’s words, because it couldn’t be a lie since Gu Ning knew Shangguan Yang.

In addition, given Shangguan Yang’s level and status, it wasn’t strange that he had magical things.

“Alright, see you, Miss Dongfang, Mr. Wu,” said Gu Ning.

After that, Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua left.

“Since it’s from Senior Shangguan, I’m afraid there is nothing we can do. Let’s go report it to the patriarch,” said Wu Shunhua.

“Yeah, let’s go back now. Since Senior Shangguan is involved, other cultivators can’t get the magical power either,” said Dongfang Ziyu. If none of them could have it, she could keep the balance.

A few minutes after Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua left, Gu Ning told Lin to go home. It was already 7 pm, and she could get off work.

…

Before Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua went back to their world, they contacted Dongfang Jinghong and told him the news. They wanted him to go back with them because the investigation was meaningless now.

Hearing that, Dongfang Jinghong was amazed and had doubts. He thought Gu Ning might be deceiving them.

“Don’t you know Shangguan Yang’s status? If Gu Ning doesn’t really know him, she wouldn’t have mentioned him. And she also has power crystals. She can’t be an ordinary mortal. If there is something like that in the cultivation world, we would have known about it,” said Dongfang Ziyu.

Hearing that, Dongfang Jinghong agreed and accepted that explanation.

Therefore, Dongfang Jinghong met them and they went back to the cultivation world together.

When they were back in the Dongfang family’s house in the cultivation world, it was already 10 pm. Once they were home, they talked to Dongfang He about it.

Dongfang He didn’t doubt it either. As Dongfang Ziyu had said to Dongfang Jinghong, if Gu Ning didn’t really know Shangguan Yang, she wouldn’t have mentioned him.

In other words, even if it wasn’t given to her by Shangguan Yang, she must have a relationship with Shangguan Yang to be able to mention him.

Shangguan Yang must be aware that they had been secretly spying on Gu Ning for a long time, so he told Gu Ning to tell them the truth to stop them.

If so, they should stop spying on Gu Ning for the sake of Shangguan Yang. They couldn’t mess with Shangguan Yang nor could they get anything they wanted from him.

Other people didn’t know it was Shangguan Yang who supported Gu Ning, so they continued to try to find out the truth.

On the weekend, Gu Ning went to work at her company. They reached many deals with other companies, so Gu Ning went to help them when she was free. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Although she didn’t need to manage the company in person and Chen Cangyi would do that for her, she would take it over sooner or later, so she had to learn as much as possible.

…

Today, Baili Zongxue and Song Miaoge agreed to visit the Pavilion of Magic together. At 11 am, the two met at a nearby shopping mall. After having lunch, they went there.

Once Baili Zongxue approached, Jing Yunyao felt the air of a cultivator, so she said to Lin that she needed to deal with something and quickly went out with Miao Jingjing. Therefore, when Baili Zongxue and Song Miaoge arrived, there was only Lin in the shop.

Although there were many customers in the shop and Lin was busy, she could do her work well. Normally, people came in and looked around by themselves. If they found what they liked, they would ask for the price and pay for it if they wanted it. And for convenience, all the plants in the shop had a price tag, so normally they didn’t bargain. They only offered a discount if a customer bought a lot.

Walking into the Pavilion of Magic, Baili Zongxue realized why the plants here were so attractive. She felt the magical power in them.

The two of them didn’t stay inside for too long. After about a dozen minutes, Baili Zongxue bought two pots, while Song Miaoge bought five.

Because they said they were Gu Ning’s friends, Lin, who was informed earlier, gave them a 30% discount.

They didn’t lack money, but they were happy to have a discount.

At this moment, Baili Zongxue didn’t think about Baili Zongyang’s attitude if he saw her come home with two succulent plants. She didn’t realize it would cause trouble until she was home and Baili Zongyang really saw them. She regretted bringing them home afterwards. However, she already brought them home, so she had to face the trouble. Anyway, it was easy to explain the situation.
