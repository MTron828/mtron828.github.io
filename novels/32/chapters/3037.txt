3039 Successful Beginning

After all, the drama just happened and Fengyang was seriously affected. It would take a long time to recover.

If they did a new project and it became popular, they might gain people’s trust again.

“So, I plan to do a new project to make Xiayoa known to more people. I want it to be famous once the new project is out,” Leng Xiaoyao said seriously.

At the beginning, they still felt it was normal, but they lacked confidence when Leng Xiaoyao said that she wanted their company to become famous in the industry.

!!

They didn’t think Leng Xiaoyao was bragging, because that was also their dream, but they felt it would be very difficult.

Leng Xiaoyao understood what they were thinking, so she said, “I know your worries, but it’s an idea I have had in mind for a long time. I wonder whether you can help me?”

“What is it?” they asked her.

“How much do you know about programming games?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

Upon hearing that, they realized Leng Xiaoyao wanted to make a game, but that wasn’t easy at all, so they were shocked.

“We’ve done several website games, but we’ve never succeeded in making mobile games,” Mu Yufan said.

They were involved in the technology industry, so they could make games, but they weren’t skilled enough to make a good one.

“It’s not a problem. I can do the programming, and you only need to maintain it. I’ll teach you how to do it later. I’ll write down the story and characters later. You can get familiar with it first,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Hearing that Leng Xiaoyao would do the programming, everyone was surprised and amazed.

“Boss, can you do that alone? You’ll be exhausted,” Zhou Yunkai said worriedly. It took a long time to finish a single character in the game. And there would be at least a dozen main characters and some unimportant characters in a game. It was a lot of work!

“It’s fine. Actually, I’m already doing it. Within a month I will finish all the characters. The programming should take about a month. After I take the National College Entrance Examination, it can be released,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Hearing that Leng Xiaoyao could finish all the characters and release the game within two months, they were astonished.

Even a team could barely do the work that quickly, but Leng Xiaoyao was alone!

What surprised them more was that Leng Xiaoyao was still a student and that she was going to write the National College Entrance Examination soon.

In that case, how did she have enough time to make the game? Normally, senior high school students would feel they didn’t have enough time to review!

Even though Leng Xiaoyao told them that she was already coding the game, they still felt it was unrealistic to finish it within two months.

“Boss, if you’re going to take the National College Entrance Examination, do you have enough time to make the game?” Mu Yufan asked.

“Yeah, you need to go to class and review. You can’t neglect the exam because of the game,” Zhou Yunkai said. He was worried about Leng Xiaoyao’s study.

“No need to worry about that. Even if I don’t review, I can easily get a total score of 700 points. And I study hard in class. I only make the game after class. You don’t need to worry about me. I know how to handle it, and I never do things if I don’t have the confidence,” Leng Xiaoyao explained.

If she was an ordinary girl, she wouldn’t dare to say that, but she was a cultivator. It wouldn’t affect her at all even if she stayed up all night.

In fact, Leng Xiaoyao stayed up all night to make the game after the evening class was over.

Sometimes, she asked for leave.

She could also stop helping her classmates with reviews on weekends once in a while, then she had two more days to make the game. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The others were still worried, but since Leng Xiaoyao said that, they said nothing else. After all, she was the boss. If they argued against her, it would be disrespectful.

“Alright, it’s late now. You can get off work and go home now. Manager Mu, you can pull me into your WeChat group. If you have any questions, you can @(mention) me on WeChat when I’m absent. I’ll reply to you once I read it,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Sure,” Mu Yufan agreed.

After that, Leng Xiaoyao left after Mu Yufan gave her the key to the office building.

When Leng Xiaoyao was gone, the staff didn’t leave right away. Instead, they cleaned the floor and left an office for Leng Xiaoyao.

Mu Yufan used to be the general manager, so he had the largest office. Without hesitation, he moved out and left it for Leng Xiaoyao. Then he moved into the office of the deputy manager, where Jiang Zeshu used to be.

After that, they talked about what Leng Xiaoyao had told them.

“Hey, do you think the boss can really do what she said? I can’t believe it.”

“Yeah! I trust her, but I don’t think it’s possible.”

“I also think so, so I’m slightly worried.”

“…”

“Alright, no need to be so worried. I believe our boss can do it. She’s so impressive. Even if we fail, we can try again till we succeed. I don’t think we’ll lose anything if we can’t finish the game within two months. We can just postpone it,” Mu Yufan said.

Hearing that, the others agreed and stopped being worried.

“The boss said that she’ll give us high salaries as long as we work hard and stay loyal, but if any of you dare to betray the company, I believe she’ll punish you seriously. I hope you can keep it in mind. Yunkai and I will do the same thing. If the company can develop better and better, it’ll be good for all of us. Otherwise, we won’t be able to live a good life. Anyway, we need to work for our future,” Mu Yufan said.

“Manager Mu, we’ll do our best. We’ll never betray the company.” Everyone promised sincerely.
