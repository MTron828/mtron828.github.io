Chapter 1428: The Owner of Shenghua Real Estate

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning went to An Guangyao’s office and they talked about business for a while before Gu Ning left.

Yu Mixi was only an intern, so she could get off work earlier than the others, and could leave at 5:30 pm.

The financial controller thought that Gu Ning would come back to the finance department, but Gu Ning directly left. She directly called Yu Mixi and told her that she would wait for her at the door.

Yu Mixi walked outside and left with Gu Ning. Because she already took the power crystal Gu Ning gave her, she felt better and joined in the gathering with her friends.

“Ningning, are you a director of Shenghua Real Estate?” Yu Mixi asked Gu Ning all of a sudden.

“Yeah, but I’m actually its owner if you want to be specific,” Gu Ning said. Since Yu Mixi had that question, Gu Ning decided to tell her the truth.

“What?” Yu Mixi was shocked. To her astonishment, Gu Ning was the owner of Shenghua Real Estate!

“Does that mean you helped An Yi’s family?” Yu Mixi asked again.

“Yes, it was me,” Gu Ning said.

Yu Mixi took a long breath in with surprise.

“Am I the only one who’s aware of it till now?” Yu Mixi asked. She was talking about Chu Peihan and their other friends.

“Yeah, but I don’t know whether An Yi is aware of it or not,” Gu Ning said.

Knowing that, Yu Mixi’s eyes lit up with excitement.

“Can I tell them?” Yu Mixi asked worriedly, because she might blurt it out.

“It’s fine. I didn’t tell them because nobody brought it up,” Gu Ning said.

“So I can tell them, right?” Yu Mixi said.

“Yeah.” Gu Ning smiled.

“Great, I’ll tell them later to surprise them!” Yu Mixi got excited.

Gu Ning was amused by her reaction, but wouldn’t stop her.

When they arrived at the appointed place, the others were all present.

The second they walked into the private room, Yu Mixi said, “Everyone, I just found out a secret about Ningning. Do you want to know?”

“What is it? Tell us!” The others were curious and urged Yu Mixi to tell them.

“Ningning is...” Yu Mixi said, then deliberately stopped to make them more curious about it.

“Say it!”

“Tell us, now!”

“...”

Yu Mixi felt satisfied and said, “Ningning is the owner of Shenghua Real Estate.”

“What?”

“Really?”

“Boss is the owner of Shenghua Real Estate?”

Everyone was shocked.

Although they knew that Gu Ning was very outstanding and that she had many other companies they didn’t know about, they were still surprised when they heard that Shenghua Real Estate was also owned by her.

If they weren’t familiar with Gu Ning’s companies, they wouldn’t be surprised. It wasn’t a secret that Shenghua Real Estate had a new owner, but they were greatly surprised that Gu Ning bought it.

An Yi’s father was now the executive of Shenghua Real Estate.

Yu Mixi laughed seeing their shocked faces.

“Boss, is that true?” Hao Ran asked Gu Ning.

“Yes, it’s true,” Gu Ning said.

“Why didn’t you tell me?” Chu Peihan complained. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“You know we’re familiar with Shenghua Real Estate!” Su Anya said.

“...”

They began to criticize Gu Ning, but Gu Ning didn’t mind.

“Alright, I know it’s my fault, so I’ll pay the bill tonight,” Gu Ning said.

Normally they shared the bill, unless it was a meaningful meal and someone wanted to pay the bill on his or her own. For example, the others were dissatisfied with Gu Ning’s behavior this time, so Gu Ning needed to pay the bill.

“Of course you should.”

“You can’t keep it a secret from us!”

“...”

They were close friends after all, and there was no need for them to be too polite towards each other.

In fact, no one was more shocked than An Yi. He couldn’t believe his ears when Gu Ning gave them an affirmative answer. In that case, Gu Ning had done his family a very important favor without him knowing it.

Gu Ning noticed An Yi’s reaction and expression.

“An Yi, do you blame me for keeping it a secret from you all this time?” Gu Ning asked An Yi.

Actually, Gu Ning saved An Yi’s family by buying Shenghua Real Estate from his father, and he should be grateful to her.
