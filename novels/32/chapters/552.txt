Chapter 553 Your Younger Brother Is in My Hands

Having been schemed against by the man she loved, Xia Yichu felt deeply hurt, but she was angrier and more resentful than ever. She had lost herself in the ridiculous love so much that she didn’t discover that Qiao Guanxiang was so shameless, snobbish and would get whatever he wanted by hook or by crook until now.

“Yichu, I’ll give you money to get plastic surgery as compensation, and I’ll raise your salary too. Please, keep being Hena’s ghost singer,” Qiao Guanxiang almost begged in order to protect his reputation and career.

“If I had enough money to get plastic surgery, do you think that I’d be willing to be Pei Hena’s ghost singer any longer? I can stand on the stage myself!” Xia Yichu sneered.

Xia Yichu was beautiful, and she was a singer, not an actress, so the audience had comparatively lower standard of appearance. As long as she could sing well, she was confident that she could be popular. However, her face was disfigured. A disfigured face was different from an ugly face, and she felt quite self-abased ever since the “accident” had happened to her.

Thinking of that, Xia Yichu clenched her teeth in anger. “Qiao Guanxiang, I promise that I’ll pay you and Pei Hena back!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qiao Guanxiang seemed extremely displeased, and blurt out, “Xia Yichu, if you dare to do that, I’ll kill you and nobody will know that you’ve ever existed!”

Facing the threat, Xia Yichu stayed calm, and raised her phone to show Qiao Guanxiang. “Qiao Guanxiang, do you think that I came here to meet you without preparing anything? I’ve recorded every sentence you just said. If you dare hurt me, I’ll spread it across the Internet.”

“You...” Qiao Guanxiang panicked at once, reaching out to grab Xia Yichu’s phone, but Xia Yichu escaped on time.

Qiao Guanxiang was in a rage now. Thinking that Xia Yichu could ruin his reputation and career, he lost control of his emotions. However, he thought of something all of a sudden, and seemed less angry. “Xia Yichu, don’t forget that your younger brother is in my hands. If you dare to spread the recording across the Internet, I’ll make a call, and your younger brother will be tortured.”

Qiao Guanxiang had a connection with gangs.

“How dare you!” Xia Yichu panicked this time. Her younger brother was her only family in this world and she couldn’t tolerate it if anything bad happened to him. Xia Yichu swore at herself. How could she forget that! Her younger brother was innocent and Qiao Guanxiang would keep her younger brother as a hostage.

“Face the reality Xia Yichu, and we can work together as usual. Don’t worry. I’ll still raise your salary,” Qiao Guanxiang said arrogantly. “However, if you dare to refuse, you can’t bear the result.”

Xia Yichu was so mad, but she could do nothing about it. Although she hated Qiao Guanxiang and Pei Hena to death, she was reluctant to put her younger brother in a dangerous situation. She chose to yield for her younger brother’s safety.

“Fine, I agree,” Xia Yichu said in the end. She couldn’t risk her younger brother’s life.

Hearing their conversation, Gu Ning really appreciated Xia Yichu now.

“Very well. Now, delete the recording,” Qiao Guanxiang ordered.

Xia Yichu didn’t want to do it but she had to obey Qiao Guanxiang’s order and deleted the recording right in front of him.

“You can have the day off and I’ll send some people to watch over your younger brother. If you dare do anything to resist my control, your younger brother is doomed,” Qiao Guanxiang said.

As long as Xia Yichu’s younger brother was in his hands, he wasn’t afraid that Xia Yichu wouldn’t listen to him.

After threatening Xia Yichu, Qiao Guanxiang left, while Xia Yichu collapsed to the ground bursting into tears.

At this moment, Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting to wait for her, while she walked to Xia Yichu.

“Did you sing every song for Pei Hena?” Gu Ning asked.

Hearing a stranger’s voice, Xia Yichu was a little scared. She stopped crying at once, looking to Gu Ning with fear on her face. “Did-did you hear everything just then?”

Xia Yichu was horrified. If this girl spread what she had heard abroad, her younger brother would be in great danger.

Noticing Xia Yichu’s worry, Gu Ning laid her cards on the table. “Don’t worry. I won’t leak a word out. I just want to figure out whether you sang every song for Pei Hena. If so, you rouse my interest, and we can cooperate if you don’t want to be controlled by them any longer.”

“What? Cooperate?” Xia Yichu was surprised and doubted it.

Gu Ning looked younger than 20-years-old, so it was hard for Xia Yichu to believe that Gu Ning could help her. Xia Yichu wasn’t judging Gu Ning from her appearance, but she did seem too young.

“Well, have you heard of Su Tongnuo?” Gu Ning opened her mouth.

“Do you mean the actress?” Xia Yichu said.

“Yes,” Gu Ning replied.

“I’ve heard her name, and she’s quite popular recently,” Xia Yichu said but didn’t understand why Gu Ning suddenly asked that question.

“I understand that you have doubts about my ability, but let me tell you a secret that Su Tongnuo is working for my company now,” Gu Ning said.

“What? You’re the boss of Fenghua Entertainment?” Xia Yichu was shocked. She couldn’t believe her ears. Although Fenghua Entertainment was a newly-established company, it was quite powerful in the entertainment industry.

“Yes,” Gu Ning said directly.

Hearing her affirmative answer, Xia Yichu began to believe that this young girl before her eyes really could help her.
