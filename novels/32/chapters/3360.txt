3363 Why Are You So Confident?

Leng Xiaoyao briefly told Li Mochen the story. Li Mochen got mad at once, but Lin Lipeng was no longer around. Otherwise, Li Mochen would have killed him with just a glare.

The two of them arrived at the company. Leng Xiaoyao introduced Li Mochen to Mu Yufan and others as a friend who came to visit.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t avoid mentioning the games created by their company and let Li Mochen know about them.

It refreshed Li Mochen’s view on Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities once again.

He was great at hacking, but not so much with games.

After spending some time in the company, Leng Xiaoyao suddenly thought of an important matter.

“Oh, by the way, after the renovation of the company in the capital city is completed, we’ll basically move there, but we haven’t yet solved the accommodation problem for the employees.” Leng Xiaoyao said, “Brother Mochen, if you have time, could you help me look for apartments near the company? We don’t need to worry about accommodation for new recruits when we move to the capital, but we still need to take care of the current employees. There are ten people. Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai are both managers and shareholders. Each of them needs a single apartment. The other eight people can also rent single apartments. Otherwise two people can stay in one room, but if we rent a suite, room size will vary, and it might cause disputes.”

Since they all stayed because of friendship and were willing to follow her to the capital city, she couldn’t treat them unfairly.

If she treated them well, they would work harder as well.

“No problem.” Li Mochen agreed. He didn’t think there was anything wrong with what Leng Xiaoyao did. He even thought that Leng Xiaoyao knew how to win people’s trust. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Is it not too much trouble for Mr. Li?” Mu Yufan felt a little embarrassed. After all, they were looking for accommodation for themselves, not for Leng Xiaoyao. They also didn’t know about the relationship between Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen.

“It’s not a problem. Friends should help each other,” Li Mochen said.

“Then thank you, Mr. Li.” Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai could only express their gratitude. They were very grateful to Leng Xiaoyao for bringing them here.

They knew that renting a single apartment in the capital city wasn’t cheap. The average renting price was about three thousand yuan a month.

They had just experienced almost going bankrupt, so it was difficult for them to afford a single apartment which cost three thousand yuan a month.

However, they believed that as long as they followed Leng Xiaoyao, released a great game that became popular, they would be able to afford their own house in the capital city soon.

Making a good game was their current goal.

Leng Xiaoyao hadn’t included Shen Xiyin in the accommodation arrangements yet because she didn’t need to work in the capital city office. She would be arranged later when she arrived in the capital city.

At noon, Leng Xiaoyao invited everyone to have lunch together, then after lunch, Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen left together.

To avoid yesterday’s drama from happening again. Instead of going out on the street, they went directly to the circuit since Li Mochen had something to talk to Si Yiqi about.

However, they saw familiar faces at the circuit – Chu Jianan and Jiang Yihan.

Chu Jianan had just been discharged from the hospital a few days ago after being hospitalized due to being beaten up. He suffered a lot and didn’t look as good as before.

Although the Jiang family forbade Jiang Yihan from having any contact with Chu Jianan since their scandal was exposed, Jiang Yihan still contacted him anyway.

However, Chu Jianan was in pain and had no physical needs, so he only felt annoyed by Jiang Yihan’s contact and eventually cut off their relationship.

After he recovered from his injuries, he thought of Jiang Yihan again. So today, when his friend invited him to hang out, he also invited Jiang Yihan.

When Leng Xiaoyao saw them, they also saw Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen. Chu Jianan was jealous of Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen’s pairing.

Knowing Li Mochen’s extraordinary family background, Chu Jianan and Jiang Yihan didn’t dare to do anything. They just looked at Leng Xiaoyao with envy.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t mind it, but Li Mochen cared. His cold gaze made the two of them immediately look away.

Although they felt angry, they didn’t dare to say anything.

“Hey! When did you come to City Chang? I didn’t know.” Si Yiqi saw Li Mochen and was surprised.

“Now you know, don’t you?” Li Mochen looked at him with disdain.

Used to being disliked, Si Yiqi didn’t take it seriously. “Why do I feel that something is strange today?”

“Why?” Li Mochen frowned.

“You two,” Si Yiqi said, feeling that their relationship was different, but he didn’t know for sure and didn’t want to make Leng Xiaoyao uncomfortable.

Leng Xiaoyao got nervous, afraid that Li Mochen would admit it directly, so she opened her mouth first. “I think you are the strange one!”

“Why?” Si Yiqi was confused.

“You think too much,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Tsk tsk! Can’t I just think about it?” Leng Xiaoyao’s words dispelled Si Yiqi’s speculation about their relationship, but also made Li Mochen feel upset.

It would take him more time to chase his love!

He respected Leng Xiaoyao. Since she didn’t want to accept him yet, he wouldn’t say anything about it!

They had lunch at the circuit in the afternoon. After eating, Leng Xiaoyao had to go home.

Li Mochen also needed to catch a flight tomorrow morning. They didn’t know how long it would be until they saw each other again, so both of them were reluctant to part.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want him to leave, but she couldn’t do anything about it. Li Mochen had other things to deal with.

“When are you going back to the capital city? Let me know. If I have nothing to do here, I’ll go over,” Leng Xiaoyao said. After all, this vacation was quite long. In a few days, her score in the National College Entrance Examination would come out, then she would have to fill out her college application. She wouldn’t register until the end of August, so she still had two months of vacation!

“Okay,” Li Mochen agreed. He also knew that as much as they didn’t want to part, they needed to. He couldn’t just stop working because he was in love!

Though honestly, he wasn’t really in a relationship yet. He was still in his probation period!

When they parted ways, Li Mochen kissed Leng Xiaoyao, which made her angry. “I haven’t accepted you yet! Why did you kiss me?”

“You’ll accept me sooner or later.” Li Mochen smirked confidently.

“Are you that confident?” Leng Xiaoyao rolled her eyes resignedly.

Fine! He was confident for a reason. Besides Li Mochen, she really wasn’t interested in anyone else!

Mainly because as a cultivator, her lifespan was very long. If she didn’t meet someone she loved deeply and couldn’t let go of, she would never choose to be with an ordinary person.
