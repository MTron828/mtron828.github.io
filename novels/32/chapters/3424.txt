3426 Apologize and Compensate

Although Ms. Lin was a bit afraid of Li Mochen, she still bravely retorted. “My daughter said she bullied her, and that’s the truth.”

“Who knows if they are telling the truth!” Ms. Lin coldly questioned, expressing doubt, but she actually felt guilty because she knew her daughter’s behavior. Her daughter was always the one who bullied others.

So what? Being bullied by her daughter was an honor for them!

In terms of dealing with people, she had never suffered!

Upon hearing that, the head teacher was also angry and said, “Ms. Lin, why do you think all the classmates are lying! You are humiliating them. It’s clearly Zhang Yaya’s fault. Tang Ning is a well-behaved girl who just came today and doesn’t even dare to talk to people. How could she bully your daughter? Don’t you know what kind of person your daughter is? I’m afraid there are few people in the whole school who don’t know!”

She had long been displeased with Ms. Lin and Zhang Yaya. Her patience had already been exhausted because Zhang Yaya bullied other classmates every other day.

However, the head teacher was scared of their family background and dared not say anything.

“How dare you spread rumors about my daughter? Do you want to be fired?” Ms. Lin threatened the head teacher. She thought that the head teacher was merely a nobody before her. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The headteacher closed her mouth at once.

The principal was angry, but before he could say anything, Li Mochen opened his mouth. “Oh! What right do you have to make Teacher Yang unable to stay? Is it the power of the Zhang family or the Lin family?”

When Li Mochen said that, he didn’t conceal his disdain for the Zhang family and the Lin family.

“Who are you really?” Ms. Lin suddenly felt uneasy when she saw that Li Mochen was so arrogant. Could it be that his background was really more powerful than the Zhang family and the Lin family?

“It doesn’t matter who I am, because I don’t like to bully others with power. I’m a person who distinguishes between gratitude and grudges. If you won’t admit that your daughter is wrong, then let’s ask other students about it. All I want is a sincere apology and appropriate compensation. After all, children’s fights shouldn’t escalate to the level of families’ feuds, right? However, Ms. Lin has no remorse at all and has even insulted me. It makes me very disappointed,” Li Mochen said, with the air of a powerful upper-class man. It really scared Mrs. Lin.

However, it was really difficult for her to apologize at this moment!

“What is your name, sir?” Ms. Lin asked.

“Li Mochen.” Li Mochen replied.

Obviously, Ms. Lin had heard of Li Mochen. After hearing his name, she widened her eyes in surprise.

She knew that Li Mochen had been expelled from the Li family, but he had his own abilities and had a close relationship with many big shots!

It was what her husband had told her. Now the Li family wanted to have Li Mochen back because of his abilities! If Li Mochen returned to the Li family, she wouldn’t be able to offend him even more.

As a result, Ms. Lin dared not challenge Li Mochen anymore, even though she was still unwilling in her heart. She immediately apologized. “Mr. Li, I’m sorry for my words. How much compensation do I need to pay?”

Tang Ning was the one who suffered the most injustice and should indeed receive an apology and compensation.

Ms. Lin originally thought that Li Mochen was going to give her a hard time! Upon hearing that it was just these few conditions, she immediately breathed a sigh of relief and had her daughter apologize right away.

Although Zhang Yaya was arrogant, she still listened to her mother, so she apologized to Tang Ning and promised not to trouble her again.

Afterwards, Ms. Lin gave Li Mochen a thousand yuan, then she hurriedly left with her daughter.

As soon as Ms. Lin left, the head teacher immediately apologized to Li Mochen. “Mr. Li, I’m sorry, I didn’t take good care of her.”

Although it wasn’t her intention for something like this to happen, Tang Ning was bullied on her first day of school, and she felt guilty about it.

“It’s not your fault. After all, you can’t take care of everything, but I hope the principal can remind each subject teacher to pay a little more attention to Tang Ning and prevent her from being bullied or stop it immediately if she is bullied,” said Li Mochen. He wasn’t an unreasonable person, and people only dared to bully Tang Ning when the teacher wasn’t around.

In fact, the head teacher had already done a good job. She immediately took Tang Ning to the infirmary when she found out about the accident and informed the principal, who also informed him.

“No problem.” The principal agreed.

“Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Li,” Teacher Yang said gratefully.

“Since Tang Ning is injured, I need to take her home and will send her back when she recovers,” said Li Mochen.

The principal had no objections so Li Mochen took Tang Ning home then.

When he took Tang Ning home, Li Mochen also called Feng Dongcheng to avoid him being panicked if he couldn’t bring Tang Ning back later.

Tong Xianglan had already moved over in the morning, so she was at home at this time.

Because they were close by, Tang Xing and Tang Ning would be picked up and sent home for lunch, usually at 11:40 am, then they would have an hour’s nap time after lunch before their afternoon classes at 2:30 pm.

It was 11 am at this time, and Tong Xianglan had started cooking.

Suddenly someone rang the doorbell, so Tong Xianglan hurried to answer it. When she saw Li Mochen carrying Tang Ning back, she was also taken aback and immediately went to open the door.

“Sir, what happened?” Tong Xianglan asked, showing genuine concern on her face.

“She was pushed down by a classmate and will be resting at home these days. Stew some chicken soup for her in the afternoon to make up for it,” said Li Mochen.

“Of course,” Tong Xianglan replied. She was also very angry about Tang Ning being bullied.

Although she hadn’t formally interacted with Tang Ning yet, she was the one she had to take care of, and they would live together for a long time in the future, so she would treat her sincerely.

Anyway, seeing that Li Mochen had brought Tang Ning back, he must have dealt with the matter.
