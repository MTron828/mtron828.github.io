Chapter 1815: What Is That?

They needed to have an evening class during the military training, but they could sit or rest their arms on the class desk in the classroom to relax themselves. Unfortunately, the instructors told them to come to the playground, which would make it impossible for them to have a rest.

No one was willing to do that, but nobody dared to resist.

In the evening, they didn’t need to wear a military uniform, and they could put on casual clothes, so they went to do laundry in their dorm rooms after having dinner.

After a long day, their clothing was quite stinky, it was intolerable.

Because it was hot, the clothing would be completely dry after being hung up for a night.

The instructors were going to teach them songs about the military, which had been popular for a long time, so most people were familiar with them or even able to sing them. Accordingly, the students soon learned them.

At 9 pm, they dispersed, going back to sleep in their dorm rooms. After a day of torture, no one had the mood to do other activities.

The next day, once they gathered together, they stood at attention again, however, it was not just for half an hour, but 40 minutes this time.

Although they had practiced standing at attention for half an hour twice, it didn’t mean that they were already used to it. As a result, many of them couldn’t stand it when the time was 10 minutes longer.

Because not every student was physically strong enough to finish the practice, someone screamed after standing for just over 20 minutes. The next second, a student fell to the ground with a thump.

The sound attracted many people’s attention and they saw a boy lying on the ground in the team of Class B.

They thought he just fainted, but unexpectedly he went into convulsions.

Gu Ning also noticed that, and she made a judgment the second she saw the symptoms. The boy was having an attack of epilepsy.

Epilepsy might occur as a result of a genetic disorder or an acquired brain injury, such as a trauma or stroke.

It was also called seizure disorder. During a seizure, a person experienced abnormal behavior, symptoms, and sensations, sometimes including loss of consciousness.

Some people with epilepsy simply stared blankly for a few seconds during a seizure, while others repeatedly twitched their arms or legs.

When the boy fell down, he hit his head against the ground, which was quite serious and dangerous.

The surrounding students all moved away in fear.

The instructor of Class B was strong and immediately took off his shirt, then walked over and stuffed it into the boy’s mouth to prevent him from biting his tongue.

They couldn’t move the boy during the attack, so the infirmary told their class leader to bring a doctor over from the infirmary.

It was an emergency, so Gu Ning had to do something. She had no time to ask for leave from her instructor, and ran to the boy.

Seeing that, the instructor frowned, but didn’t stop her. Instead, he followed her. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

After he learned Gu Ning’s background, he knew that Gu Ning went there to help the boy.

“Why is she going there? Does she think of herself as a doctor?”

One girl was quite unkind and believed that Gu Ning shouldn’t go there.

Someone heard her and couldn’t stand it. “She might be helpful! Why do you have to be so harsh?”

Hearing that, many students looked at the girl with annoyance, because her words were indeed harsh, which made the girl feel quite uneasy.

Although she was dissatisfied with their reaction, it was indeed too much that she criticized Gu Ning at this key moment, so she didn’t argue back.

Gu Ning went to the front of the boy, then squatted with a small porcelain bottle in her hand. There were power crystals inside.

“Sir, I have pills here to stabilize his condition,” Gu Ning said to the instructor of their class.

Hearing that, the instructor looked at Gu Ning with doubt, but he saw confidence in her eyes and he had also l learned a lot about Gu Ning’s unbelievable achievements, so he was willing to trust her.

However, it was a matter of life, and he didn’t dare to let Gu Ning treat the boy right now. Therefore, he hesitated for a while.

Other people began to talk about it.

“Seriously? She can help the boy with the illness? Is she joking?”

“Does she think she can do everything?”

“...”

Facing their questions, Gu Ning wasn’t affected, because she had no time to waste on them. Instead, she focused on the instructor. “Sir, he hit his head when he fell down just now. His life is in danger. We must treat him as soon as possible, or tragedy might happen.”

Hearing that, someone argued in anger. “Hey, are you cursing our assistant class leader?”

The boy who had an attack of epilepsy was the compensatory assistant class leader of Class B, Zhou Jiahao.

“Right, how can you curse our assistant class leader?” Many students of Class B chimed in.

“Let her do it.” Right at this moment, Rong Jue opened his mouth. He just learned of the situation and he trusted Gu Ning.

Since Rong Jue said that, nobody dared to disagree again.

Some felt nervous for Gu Ning and hoped that her pills could work, otherwise she would be in serious trouble, while some hoped that Gu Ning would fail. In that case, she would have to take responsibility.

Those who hoped that Gu Ning would fail were indeed evil. In order to laugh at Gu Ning, they were willing to see their assistant class leader in danger.

“Remove the clothing in his mouth,” said Gu Ning.

The instructor of Class B listened to Gu Ning and took the clothing off at once. At the same time, Gu Ning opened the porcelain bottle and poured out a power crystal before squeezing it into Zhou Jiahao’s mouth.

Baili Zongxue who stood about 20 meters away suddenly sensed the magical power, then she turned to look at them.

Although there was a large crowd, Baili Zongxue still saw the porcelain bottle in Gu Ning’s hand through a gap.

She was amazed by the pure magical power. Afterwards, she began to wonder what it was.

Baili Zongxue and her older brother always had a doubt that Gu Ning had something connected to magical power with her, so she wasn’t surprised to see that right now. She was only curious to know what it was.

“The fifth female student in the third row, get out!”

Because Baili Zongxue moved when she was standing at attention, the instructor called her to stand out.

Even though there was something happening in another class, it didn’t mean students of other classes could move.
