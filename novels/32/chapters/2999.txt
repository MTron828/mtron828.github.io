3000 I Won’t Lose

However, given Leng Xiaoyao’s changes these days, Leng Changyuan felt she might be serious.

Did Leng Xiaoyao really become good at studying… to the point where she was even better than Leng Yuqi? Otherwise, she wouldn’t have challenged Leng Yuxi to compete in the monthly test. After all, their bet was ten thousand yuan.

If Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t confident, she would lose a lot of money.

Leng Changyuan suddenly couldn’t wait to ask Leng Xiaoyao about it.

“Right, I just thought that Miss Xiaoyao was bragging at the beginning, but I saw Miss Yuqi accuse Miss Xiaoyao of trapping her. So it might be true that Miss Xiaoyao has become good at studying. Even Miss Yuqi felt stressed,” Uncle Liu said.

“If so, it’s possible. I need to ask Xiaoyao about it later. If she’s really good at studying now, that’s good news.” Leng Changyuan wasn’t sure of it yet, but he was already filled with happiness.

He just wanted to ask Leng Xiaoyao in person after she came home, even though Leng Yuqi was already back.

Afterwards, Uncle Liu left.

Without delay, Leng Changyuan called Leng Xiaoyao.

Looking at the call, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t avoid the others and directly answered it.

“Hi, grandpa, what’s up?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Yaoyao, did you become good at studying?” Leng Changyuan asked excitedly. Even though he didn’t expect Leng Xiaoyao to get a high score, he was still happy if she could become good at studying.

Leng Xiaoyao was surprised and asked, “Who told you that?”

“Liu told me. He heard your conversation with Yuqi about the monthly test. Tell me, what happened?” Leng Changyuan asked urgently.

Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t mad when she heard that it was Uncle Liu who told Leng Changyuan the news. Anyway, it wasn’t a secret, otherwise she would have reminded Uncle Liu to keep it a secret.

She had just planned to wait till the result of the monthly test was out to surprise Leng Changyuan.

“Yes! Grandpa, don’t worry. I won’t lose,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Why did you suddenly become good at studying? You used to be a terrible student and Yuqi was much better than you. How come you are daring to bet with her now?” Leng Changyuan asked with confusion and curiosity.

“Well, I realized that I have a good memory and comprehension. I’m actually a quick learner. Anyway, I’ll talk to you about it when I’m home later. I’m currently eating with my friends now. I can’t talk for too long,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Alright, alright, we can talk about it later.” Leng Changyuan didn’t want to bother Leng Xiaoyao.

Sitting beside Leng Xiaoyao, Xiong Manxin and Li Mochen heard Leng Changyuan’s words, but they were already aware that Leng Xiaoyao had suddenly become excellent at studying, so they weren’t surprised.

They were curious too, but Leng Xiaoyao had already given the answer. She had a good memory and comprehension, so she acquired knowledge quickly. Even if they asked her about that, they would get the same answer.

“Boss, I believe many people will be shocked when your score in the monthly test comes out,” Xiong Manxin said. She was looking forward to Monday now.

“Perhaps!” Leng Xiaoyao agreed, but she was really confident.

She guessed that she would be among the top 3 this time, but she wouldn’t tell anybody yet.

After the meal, Leng Xiaoyao and the others didn’t leave right away. Instead, they rested for a while, before they went to an open space.

Because they didn’t want other people to see them, Si Yiqi took them to an area where outsiders were forbidden to go.

Si Yiqi felt Leng Xiaoyao might be very strong, so he stayed alert.

“Miss Leng, you look very confident. I’m starting to lose courage.” Si Yiqi said half seriously, half joking, but he was indeed less confident than before. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Mr. Si, confidence matters a lot in a game. If you’re scared of me even before the competition begins, it will affect your performance. In fact, if you’re arrogant or if you take your opponent lightly, you might not be able to do your best. So, you better stay positive. Whether your opponent is strong or weak, you must take it seriously. In that case, you’ll enjoy the game whether you lose or win,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“It seems that you’re indeed very confident. Are you implying that I’m no match for you?” Si Yiqi asked. He agreed with Leng Xiaoyao, but he was still unhappy that Leng Xiaoyao disdained him.

However, if Leng Xiaoyao could really defeat him, he would accept the result.

“Yes.” Leng Xiaoyao replied confidently.

Xiong Manxin never doubted Leng Xiaoyao, and blindly admired her.

Ling Tianqi and the others, however, felt it was too much. If Leng Xiaoyao lost in the end, wouldn’t it be extremely embarrassing.

They also heard that Si Yiqi was very good at martial arts.

Although they had seen Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities, it was hard to say who would win before the result was out.

On the other hand, Li Mochen didn’t doubt Leng Xiaoyao, because he could see that she wasn’t bragging.

“Alright, no need to waste time. Let’s begin now!” Si Yiqi was slightly annoyed and didn’t want to continue.

“Great!” Leng Xiaoyao answered. Then they began to fight.

Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t use her magical energy to attack him since she was fighting with a mortal, but she would strengthen herself with it.

Because she had an ordinary body currently, she couldn’t use much power if she didn’t use magical energy.

Although they seemed equally strong at the beginning, Li Mochen could see that Leng Xiaoyao was a lot better than Si Yiqi.

No wonder she was so confident.

In that case, he was really looking forward to competing with her.

Although Si Yiqi didn’t take Leng Xiaoyao lightly and was mentally prepared, he was still amazed after seeing Leng Xiaoyao’s performance.

He realized that Leng Xiaoyao was so confident for a reason.

Gradually, Si Yiqi felt the game becoming more difficult, but Leng Xiaoyao was still at ease, which proved the gap between their abilities.

However, at that moment, only Li Mochen and Si Yiqi could see the difference. In other people’s eyes, it was still a draw.
