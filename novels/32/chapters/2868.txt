Chapter 2869: A Solution

However, if Gu Ning was the boss of Colorful Raw Jade Material Mining Company, she would be really unbelievable.

After witnessing Gu Ning’s skills at stone-gambling and her natural air of power, he understood that she couldn’t be an ordinary girl. Therefore, he would be surprised if Gu Ning was really the boss of Colorful Raw Jade Material Mining Company, but he wouldn’t doubt it.

“Yes,” said Gu Ning. There was nothing to hide. After all, Jiang Wenliang was going to work for her.

Jiang Wenliang thought it was highly likely, but he was still amazed after hearing Gu Ning’s reply.

At that moment, he had to admit that he had incredibly good luck to meet the boss of Colorful Raw Jade Material Mining Company.

“I heard that Colorful Raw Jade Material Mining Company became profitable very rapidly, but I didn’t expect its boss to be a young girl like you! You have my respect!” Jiang Wenliang said sincerely.

“Thank you for your compliment, Mr. Jiang,” Gu Ning said modestly.

“Miss Gu, you’re too modest,” said Jiang Wenliang. After knowing Gu Ning’s status, he was much more relieved.

Gu Ning smiled but didn’t say anything further.

“Ha-ha, ha-ha, our boss indeed keeps a low profile. She has achieved a lot more than you can imagine!” Zheng Peng replied laughingly.

Hearing that, Jiang Wenliang was even more surprised. Obviously, Gu Ning was more powerful than just being the boss of the Colorful Raw Jade Material Mining Company, but he knew that he shouldn’t ask about it.

“If so, I’m looking forward to knowing what else Miss Gu owns,” Jiang Wenliang said.

He said that he was looking forward to knowing more, but he didn’t directly ask about it.

“If you want to know, you can search my name on the Internet. Colorful Raw Jade Material Mining Company is about to be merged into the Shengning Organization, so it’s not a big deal if you know it,” Gu Ning said. Since Jiang Wenliang was aware that she was the boss of Colorful Raw Jade Material Mining Company, he would find out that she was also the chairman of the Shengning Organization sooner or later.

Upon hearing the name of a business organization, Jiang Wenliang realized that Gu Ning was already extremely successful.

“Can I do that right now?” Jiang Wenliang asked. He couldn’t wait to know more about Gu Ning, but he was afraid that it might be impolite if he took out his phone right away.

“Be my guest. No need to be so serious when we’re not talking about work,” Gu Ning replied calmly. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

She didn’t care much about status. In her eyes, everyone was equal, so she wouldn’t order her subordinates to bow to her whenever they saw her.

After all, they weren’t in public and were off work at the moment.

They only needed to pay attention to their manners when they were in the company or outside.

“Thanks.” Jiang Wenliang replied with a better impression of Gu Ning. It was hard to meet a boss who didn’t put on any airs.

After all, many people gave themselves airs once they gained some influence.

With Gu Ning’s permission, Jiang Wenliang immediately took out his phone and searched for news about her.

When he read her introduction, he was struck dumb.

She turned out to be the chairman of the Shengning Organization.

The Shengning Organization was a very large business group. Although he didn’t pay special attention to it, he had heard a lot about it. It was a newly established company, but it already owned over fifty billion yuan in assets. It was amazingly successful.

“M-Miss Gu, you’re the chairman of the Shengning Organization? I can’t believe my eyes!” Jiang Wenliang said excitedly. He didn’t doubt whether Gu Ning built the company on her own, it just further proved that she wasn’t an ordinary girl since she could be so successful.

“I’m flattered,” said Gu Ning.

“It’s the truth! You’re really amazing Miss Gu!” said Jiang Wenliang.

After the meal, Jiang Wenliang walked away with Zheng Peng who would arrange work for him. There was nothing Gu Ning needed to be worried about.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting rested in the hotel for a while, then checked out and left. They went directly to the airport.

…

When Jiang Wenliang and Zheng Peng got into the same car outside the restaurant, Jiang Dashun’s friend saw them and shared the news with him.

Jiang Dashun was shocked to know that Jiang Wenliang had a relationship with Zheng Peng.

They were peers, so Jiang Dashun had heard of Zheng Peng, even before Colorful Raw Jade Material Mining Company was opened in City Rui. After all, the rise of Colorful Raw Jade Material Mining Company had caused a sensation in the jade industry.

Currently, Colorful Raw Jade Material Mining Company was the most famous jade mining company in Province Yun and was ranked in the top 10. If Jiang Wenliang had a close relationship with Zheng Peng, it would be more difficult for Jiang Dashun to attack him.

Most importantly, Jiang Dashun didn’t know how close they were. If they were just acquaintances, it wouldn’t be a big deal, but if they were close…

No matter what, Jiang Dashun was jealous of Jiang Wenliang because of his relationship with Zheng Peng.

How could Jiang Wenliang suddenly become so lucky? He just got help from a rich girl yesterday, and now he met Zheng Peng.

After the call, Jiang Dashun was full of anger and Fang Lin asked him, “Baby, what happened? Why do you look so mad?”

Jiang Dashun then told Fang Lin what he just learned about Jiang Wenliang.

Fang Lin was shocked too and felt anxious. “Jiang Wenliang has a relationship with Zheng Peng? W-Won’t it make it harder for us to deal with him?”

“It’s not a big deal that he has a relationship with Zheng Peng. Zheng Peng might not help him. If he’s Zheng Peng’s close friend, Zheng Peng could have helped him earlier on!” Jiang Dashun said, but he was actually extremely anxious.

He hoped that Jiang Wenliang and Zheng Peng were just acquaintances, so that Zheng Peng wouldn’t help Jiang Wenliang. However, they had no idea whether Zheng Peng would help Jiang Wenliang or not.

“Do you have any ideas to deal with Jiang Wenliang now?” asked Fang Lin.

“No,” said Jiang Dashun. Most importantly, he didn’t trust other people, but he couldn’t do it on his own, so he was hesitant to deal with Jiang Wenliang now.

“I have an idea. I wonder whether it’ll work,” said Fang Lin. When she said that, she blinked in panic, but Jiang Dashun didn’t notice it.

“What is it?” Jiang Dashun asked at once.
