Chapter 2082: Shared Much of Their Glory

“Right, but Jing Yunyan isn’t weak at all, so it isn’t strange that she’s worse than him. I wonder whether Dongfang Ziyu can win the second prize. If not, she’ll have an even worse result than three years ago.”

“I think it’s understandable. After all, there are so many new senior cultivators this year and Dongfang Ziyu has gotten many more magic crystals than three years ago.”

“Dongfang Ziyu is at a much higher level than three years ago as well!”

“You’re right.”

“…”

When Dongfang Ziyu heard their discussion, she was annoyed, but didn’t know what to say.

At the beginning, Dongfang He also believed that Dongfang Ziyu was highly likely to win the first prize. Even if Jing Yunyan was also in the Golden Core Stage, Jing Yunyan made it after Dongfang Ziyu, so Dongfang Ziyu should be better than Jing Yunyan.

Although it was very challenging, Dongfang Ziyu might not lose.

Afterwards, Dongfang He learned that there was another cultivator in the Golden Core Stage in Tiandaozong, so he became nervous, but he still felt the result remained unknown.

He didn’t know there were many more cultivators in the Golden Core Stage than he thought until today, so he became more anxious and gave up the hope that Dongfang Ziyu could win the championship. As long as she could get into the top 3 and collect more magic crystals than three years ago, it wouldn’t be a bad result, and it wouldn’t be embarrassing.

Dongfang Ziyu indeed had gotten many more magic crystals this year than three years ago, but Jing Yunyan still surpassed her.

Dongfang He could only hope that the other four cultivators in the Golden Core Stage wouldn’t surpass Dongfang Ziyu, otherwise she would be shut out of the top 3.

Unfortunately, he was doomed to be disappointed this time.

Before long, it was Yin Ruyan’s turn. She had six magic crystals in all, including one at the fourth level, two at the third level, two at the second level, and one at the first level. For now, she ranked third.

Although Yin Wandian and Yin Ruyan were dissatisfied with the result, they clearly knew it wasn’t easy. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The following participants were unimportant, so there was no need to elaborate.

Baili Zongxue had four magic crystals, including one at the fourth level, two at the second level, and one at the first level.

The Baili family was satisfied, because Baili Zongxue’s level wasn’t very high. Moreover, Baili Zongxue didn’t take all her team’s magic crystals as her own. She shared them with her teammates. Her teammates also had one or two magic crystals, but they were mainly at the first and the second level.

Mo Qilin showed what he gained next. He had seven magic crystals, including one at the fourth level, two at the third level, two at the second level, and two at the first level.

He had more magic crystals than Yin Ruyan, so he replaced her and ranked third.

It was impossible for Mo Qilin to stay in the top 3. Not only were Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting better than him, but there were three other cultivators who could also be more successful than him.

Because Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting aimed to win the first and second prize, they couldn’t give Mo Qilin too many magic crystals.

What Mo Qilin got was enough to amaze a lot of people, including his master, Yun Hongqing.

Yun Hongqing and many people were clearly aware that Mo Qilin couldn’t get so many magic crystals by himself and there were third-level and fourth-level magic crystals.

Therefore, they were very sure that most of Mo Qilin’s magic crystals, especially the third-level and fourth-level magic crystals were given to him by Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

If they were willing to give Mo Qilin so many magic crystals, they must…

Thinking of that, people turned to look at Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting right away.

They felt Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting wouldn’t give the magic crystals to Mo Qilin without caring about the prizes. As a result, they must have more magic crystals after giving so many to Mo Qilin. At least, they must be confident to win prizes at the top of the list. If so, the number of their magic crystals must be beyond other people’s imagination.

Dongfang Ziyu remembered their abilities in the fight against the fifth-level demonic monsters, and Jing Yunyan thought of his quick failure in the fight against Leng Shaoting. If they had good luck and met many demonic monsters with magic crystals, they could have collected a lot of magic crystals. At least, they could have far more magic crystals than them.

It seemed that Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were most likely to win the first and second prize this time.

Anyway, Jing Yunyan was unwilling to see Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning win even if he couldn’t get into the top 3.

He had conflicts with Leng Shaoting, so he hoped that other people could win the first and second prize instead of Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

Dongfang Ziyu was amazed by Leng Shaoting’s and Gu Ning’s abilities, so she was willing to accept it if they won the first and second prize, but she would only be upset by her terrible result.

However, it was her own problem, so she couldn’t blame other people for it.

Facing other people’s observation, both Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting stayed calm. Whether others were jealous of them or not, they wouldn’t care.

“Senior Shangguan, it seems your disciples have gotten a lot of magic crystals! My disciple has shared much of their glory,” said Yun Hongqing to Shangguan Yang. He complimented Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting, and also felt happy for Mo Qilin.

Even if Mo Qilin relied on Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting to get some magic crystals, the possible honor brought him a good mood.

He didn’t know how many cultivators could surpass him, but it should be easy for him to get into the top 10.

“If they couldn’t get many, I’d be disappointed,” said Shangguan Yang seriously, but there was obvious pride on his face.

He was confident that Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting would have a better result than other participants, unless they had bad luck and met few demonic monsters with magic crystals.

Obviously, it was impossible. If they had met few demonic monsters, they wouldn’t have given Mo Qilin so many magic crystals, because it would stop them from winning the first and second prize. Therefore, no matter how many magic crystals they had, they at least had the confidence to win the first and second prize.

After knowing the number of Jing Yunyan and Dongfang Ziyu’s magic crystals, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were very sure that they would win the first and second prize. Gu Ning had already seen how many magic crystals the other participants had with the help of her Jade Eyes. No one had more magic crystals than them.

Shangguan Yang sounded arrogant, but nobody dared to doubt his words because everyone had witnessed Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s abilities.

After that, the three cultivators in the Golden Core Stage showed the fruits of their labor.

The disciple of Tiandaozong had seven magic crystals in all, including one at the fifth level, one at the fourth level, one at the third level, and four at the second level.

He had the same result as Dongfang Ziyu, so they ranked second together for the time being.
