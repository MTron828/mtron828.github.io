Chapter 438 Pan Zirui Needs Help

Ouyang Siyuan and Cong Maoxue normally loved to make fun of their friends, but they were also sensitive. Therefore, once Tang Jiakai gave them a hint to change the topic, they immediately changed their question. “Gu Ning, do you really know how to play horse betting, or were you just lucky?”

In fact, Gu Ning didn’t mind their last question, but since Tang Jiakai stopped them, she would also ignore it.

“I was just lucky,” Gu Ning said.

“What?” They were all shocked. Her luck was unbelievable!

“You could win so much money just by luck? That’s amazing!” Cong Maoxue said.

“Well, what can I say? I’m always lucky.” Gu Ning smiled.

Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai had witnessed Gu Ning’s incredible luck with their own eyes, so they believed Gu Ning’s explanation.

After a while, the dishes were on the table and the waiter poured glasses of red wine for them.

Cong Maoxue raised his glass and said to them. “Let’s have a toast! Happy New Year!”

Glasses clinked against each other in the air in celebration.

In the middle of the meal, Gu Ning’s phone rang and the caller was Pan Zirui. “Hi.” Gu Ning answered his

call.

“Boss, help! Are you still in City B? We’re being chased and beaten by Zhao Kanglin’s group, and they all have wooden sticks!” Pan Zirui breathed hard. Pan Zirui’s voice was loud, so Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai, who sat next to her heard it.

Gu Ning was worried. “Where are you right now?”

“We’re at the circuit in the southern mountain road,” Pan Zirui said.

They went there today to race their cars, but Zhao Kanglin knew their schedule and brought a group of people to beat them. Zhao Kanglin and his men were well-prepared, so Pan Zirui and his friends had suddenly been attacked before they escaped to the mountains.

“I’ll be right there,” Gu Ning said standing up. “I’m sorry. It’s an emergency and I have to leave now.”

“I’ll go with you.” Cao Wenxin stood up. Although she knew that Gu Ning could handle it alone, she wouldn’t miss the chance to practice her fighting skills.

“Me too.” Tang Jiakai stood up too. He didn’t like fighting, but wanted to help Gu Ning.

“What happened? We can go with you.” Ouyang Siyuan and Cong Maoxue also stood up. Even though they had no idea what had happened, they were willing to help.

“Do you fight?” Gu Ning looked to Ouyang Siyuan and Cong Maoxue.

“Of course we do,” they said, and realized that Gu Ning had to go fight with someone.

“Great. Let’s go now,” Gu Ning said, and ran outside at once, followed by them.

The Tang family owned this hotel, so there was no need for them to pay the bill.

When they got to the parking lot, Gu Ning told them to get in Cao Wenxin’s car, and Gu Ning got straight in the driver’s seat.

“Wear the seat belts. We’re leaving for the circuit in the southern mountain road. Give me the directions,” Gu Ning said, and drove the car ahead at a high speed. Everyone in the car was astonished and scared.

Gu Ning drove the car fast on the road, and she didn’t even bother to reduce speed when there was a lot of traffic, she could always overtake them.

Other drivers on the road all noticed a red Land Rover moving smoothly at a high speed among the traffic. They kept swearing, but had to admit that the driver of the red Land Rover was really skillful.

Cao Wenxin and her friends in the car almost threw up, but they also admired Gu Ning’s impressive driving skills.

When there was less traffic on the road, Gu Ning directly raised the speed to 120 mph. It normally took around 40 minutes to get to the circuit in the southern mountain road, but Gu Ning only spent 20 minutes on the road.

When they arrived at the foot of the mountain, they saw that seven cars were stopped there, but there was no one around.

Gu Ning took out her phone and threw it to Cao Wenxin. She told Cao Wenxin to call Pan Zirui but nobody answered.

“Could he be in trouble?” Cao Wenxin guessed. Gu Ning had the same feeling. She stopped the car and used her Jade Eyes to see what was going on in the mountain.

Finally, she found two groups of people who were fighting at a steep part of the mountain. Or to be more specific, it was a group of people who kept beating another group. There were at least 12 people in Zhao Kanglin’s group, and they were violently beating as well as kicking the five in Pan Zirui’s group.

Gu Ning was furious, and others in the car all felt scared. Without hesitation, Gu Ning directly drove the car on the mountain road. She never reduced the speed, and made many abrupt hairpin turns. Although they were wearing seat belts, they couldn’t help but knock against each other or the car.

After five minutes, they arrived at the place where Pan Zirui and his friends were being beaten. Gu Ning slammed on the brakes, and everyone in the car moved forward under the force. Luckily, they had all tightly buckled their seat belts. Gu Ning unfastened her seat bet, jumping out of the car and dashed to them.

Actually, whether Cao Wenxin and her friends came along with Gu Ning or didn’t, Gu Ning could handle it well on her own. She simply didn’t want to turn their kindness down.

Cao Wenxin and the others followed Gu Ning in climbing out, but they weren’t as fast as Gu Ning.

Zhao Kanglin’s group was in the woods, so they didn’t hear the sound of the car outside. And none of them noticed that people had come until Gu Ning kicked two men.

“It’s you!” Zhao Kanglin was shocked, and he was afraid of Gu Ning.

“B-boss.” Pan Zirui was already beaten black and blue on the ground, but he was excited to see Gu Ning coming to rescue him.

“How dare you beat my people!” Gu Ning was furious, and kicked the nearest man away. The man hit a tree and broke some of his ribs.

“Everyone, she is the target!” Zhao Kanglin gave the order at once. Pan Zirui’s group was already beaten down, and had no ability to fight back.

At this time, Tang Jiakai and his friends arrived. Seeing that Gu Ning easily kicked a tall man away, they were all astonished. However, when Zhao Kanglin saw Tang Jiakai’s group, he was frightened. Why are they here?Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
