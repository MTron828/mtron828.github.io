Chapter 1197 Kill the Mutan

Before the mutant could touch Qi Tianlin, Gu Ning stopped him and began to fight against him.Because Qi Tianlin was no match for the mutant, there was no need for him to fight against the mutant. It would be a total waste of time.

“Go out now and close the door. Nobody can enter this room without my permission!” Gu Ning shouted to Qi Tianlin.

Hearing that, Qi Tianlin was surprised and said, “No, I can’t leave you alone here. It’s too dangerous.”

Although he knew that Gu Ning was good at martial arts and that she was better than him, he thought that the mutant was unusually aggressive.

“It’s fine. I can handle him, but I need to do it alone,” Gu Ning said.

Qi Tianlin remained silent for a while, then agreed. “Fine, but you must come out safely.”

“I will,” Gu Ning said with confidence.

After that, Qi Tianlin had a long glance at Gu Ning before he walked out and closed the door.

Yu Hao and Cheng Hua heard the noises of fighting from the room when Qi Tianlin walked out, and they were confused. “Qi, is Miss Gu...”

“The anesthetic lost efficacy, and Gu Ning said that she could handle him alone,” Qi Tianlin said worriedly.

Qi Tianlin didn’t tell them that the man was a mutant, because it was too strange and he didn’t know how to say it. In addition, the fewer people who knew about it, the better it would be. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

In the bedroom, Gu Ning let the jiao out once Qi Tianlin was gone, and told the jiao to deal with the mutant.

The sudden appearance of the jiao didn’t surprise the mutant at all. He wore an expressionless face the entire time. His brain was already damaged, so he only knew to attack and wasn’t afraid of anything.

“Control it first.” Gu Ning gave an order to the jiao.

Without delay, the jiao attacked the mutant.

The jiao was very strong, but the mutant also had great defensive capability, so it wasn’t easy for the jiao to control the mutant within a short time.

However, it was harder for the mutant to hurt the jiao, because their fighting skills were at totally different levels. After all, the jiao was a monster with over a thousand year of firm inner discipline.

The mutant, however, mutated from an ordinary human being, and Qi Tianlin along with his two bodyguards could control it by working together.

After two minutes, the jiao wrapped the mutant with its body, and the mutant couldn’t move at all.

“Do you know how to eliminate him?” Gu Ning asked the jiao.

“He doesn’t have Yin, or inner discipline, but is quite aggressive and good at healing himself. He isn’t a normal person, so I don’t know how to eliminate him either,” the jiao said.

The jiao didn’t belong to this world, so it had no idea how to deal with a mutant. Besides, mutants were rare and strange. It couldn’t be easily eliminated.

Afterwards, Gu Ning told the jiao how the mutant came into being.

“Well, in that case, I can only remove all his blood from his body, but it can be very difficult given his unbelievable self-healing ability,” the jiao said. It wasn’t sure whether this way could work, but it was the only way it could think of right now.

“Alright, have a try!” Gu Ning said.

The jiao bit the mutant’s neck, then began to suck his blood.

It indeed took a lot of effort to remove all the mutant’s blood, because his blood never stopped flowing, and he only looked a little pale after over 10 minutes.

As the blood was gradually sucked out by the jiao, the mutant’s face became increasingly pale. However, it was still hard to remove all his blood.

About half an hour later, two thirds of the mutant’s blood was removed and the mutant lost the ability to fight back.

Qi Tianlin was anxious when Gu Ning had stayed in the bedroom for a long time. He was afraid that she might be injured.

However, whether he wanted to go inside to have a look or not, he couldn’t get inside, because Gu Ning locked the door from the inside in case Qi Tianlin saw the jiao.

Luckily, another 10 minutes later, the jiao sucked all the mutant’s blood, and the mutant let out its last breath.

“Oh, my, it was really hard to remove all his blood.” The jiao complained.

“Thank you so much, but I still need to put you into my telepathic eye space now. I’ll let you enjoy yourself in the river in a few days,” Gu Ning said to comfort it.

“Great!” The jiao was cheered up.

After that, Gu Ning put it back into the telepathic eye space before she went to open the door.

Qi Tianlin heard the sound of opening a door and stopped at once outside. He focused on the door and held his breath.

“Are you alright?” He asked Gu Ning in a hurry the moment Gu Ning showed up.

“Yeah, I’m fine, and the man is dead,” Gu Ning said.

“Are you sure you’re fine?” Qi Tianlin asked Gu Ning again.

Gu Ning understood that Qi Tianlin was worried about her, so she said again, “I’m really fine, and you don’t need to worry about me. Look at my face. I’m fine and safe.”
