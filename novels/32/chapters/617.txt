Chapter 618 An Appointment with Xu Qinyin

Although they weren’t close, they had each other’s phone number.

Xu Qinyin was born in the Xu family, and she was a walking ad for Gu Ning. If she became a loyal customer of Gu Ning’s skincare products, the brand would soon be popular in high society. Those super-rich ladies might doubt Kouzi, but they wouldn’t doubt Xu Qinyin.

Gu Ning didn’t know whether Xu Qinyin would like Kouzi, but she knew that Xu Qinyin would try it for the sake of Leng Shaoting. As long as Xu Qinyin tried it, Gu Ning was confident that she would like it.

When Xu Qinyin received Gu Ning’s call, she was surprised but she was willing to meet Gu Ning. Therefore, Xu Qinyin left her home at once.

“Xu Qinyin, where are you going? It’s lunch time!” Seeing Xu Qinyin leaving again, her mother called her loudly.

“One of my friends came here so we’ll dine together,” Xu Qinyin said.

“Your friend? Male or female?” her mother asked in a hurry.

Xu Qinyin rolled her eyes. She knew what her mother was thinking. “Female.”

Hearing that, her mother felt disappointed. Xu Qinyin was in her mid twenties now, but she was still single and always hung out with female friends.

Xu Qinyin soon arrived at the appointed restaurant, and Gu Ning was already waiting for her inside.

“I’m sorry to keep you waiting,” Xu Qinyin said.

“Not at all. I just arrived too,” Gu Ning said with a smile. “Please have a seat.”

After ordering, Xu Qinyin asked, “Where is Shaoting? Isn’t he with you?”

“Oh, he left to carry out a task, and he isn’t in the capital now. I came here for business,” Gu Ning said, then took out the set of skincare product from her backpack. “I’ve prepared a gift for you; it’s a new product from my medical company. I don’t know whether you’ll like it or not, but I strongly suggest you give it a try.”

Although Gu Ning did want to gain a reputation for Kouzi through Xu Qinyin, she wouldn’t force her to do that.

“Your medical company?” Hearing that, Xu Qinyin was surprised again. She didn’t expect that Gu Ning would be able to do some things at such a young age.

“Yes,” Gu Ning replied.

“Well, thanks! I’ll try it.” Xu Qinyin was happy to receive Gu Ning’s gift, and she trusted Gu Ning too.

“Oh, are you free tonight?” Xu Qinyin asked Gu Ning. Obviously, Xu Qinyin had her plan.

“Yes,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Xu Qinyin’s face lit up. “Then hang out with me! One of my friends just opened a music bar and it’s interesting.”

“Sure!” Gu Ning agreed. She called Xu Qinyin, and Xu Qinyin came to meet her without hesitation, so it would be impolite if she rejected her invitation now. Anyway, she had nothing else serious to deal with.

Afterwards, Xu Qinyin drove Gu Ning to meet her friends.

“Gu Ning, have you heard? Yuxin is Si Ming’s girlfriend now, but both of them are very busy, so they seldom meet each other. I wonder what will happen to them in the future.” Xu Qinyin was a little worried about their relationship. Saying that, she suddenly thought that Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were in the same situation. “Gu Ning, you seldom meet Shaoting too, right? Don’t you feel lonely?”

Gu Ning smiled and said, “Sometimes I do, but not often, because I have many things to deal with in my life too, so I don’t have much time to feel lonely. I’m still young, and I’m fighting for my future. I don’t think it’s a bad thing.”

“Right, you’re just 18, and you’re even below the age of consent now,” Xu Qinyin said then she added, “Well, I’m really envious of you. I wish I were 18 now too so that my mother wouldn’t urge me to find a boyfriend or get married. It isn’t easy to find a boyfriend now.”

Xu Qinyin had even run away from home because of it many times, but she always went back after a short time.

“Doesn’t your older brother have many single comrades? Don’t you like any of them?” Gu Ning asked. Gu Ning understood that Xu Qinyin must have not found someone she liked among them, otherwise she wouldn’t have stayed single for such a long time.

Xu Qinyin shook her head and said, “I don’t like soldiers. They’re too busy. Like my older brother, I only see him a few times a year.”

She was right. Soldiers indeed were very busy, and their partners had to get used to loneliness.

Around a dozen minutes later, Gu Ning and Xu Qinyin arrived at the newly-opened music bar. It was a large, popular bar. The music inside wasn’t very loud, so it wasn’t noisy.

Gu Ning followed Xu Qinyin to a booth, and there was already a man sitting there with snacks, fruits and bottles of wine on the table. The man was around 30 years old. He wasn’t handsome, but was quite charming. Seeing Xu Qinyin coming, he stood up at once. “Hi!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Let me introduce you. This is the boss of this bar, Song Nan,” Xu Qinyin said to Gu Ning, then turned to talk to Song Nan, “This is my friend, Gu Ning.”

“Nice to meet you, Mr. Song.”

“Nice to meet you too, Miss Gu!”

“Please have a seat,” Song Nan said to them.

After Gu Ning and Xu Qinyin were both seated, Song Nan asked, “Only two of you?”

“My other friend will be here later,” Xu Qinyin said.

“Do you want to share this table with some handsome guys? I have two friends who’ll come here too. If you want, I can tell them to sit here with you,” Song Nan asked with a smile.

“Are you sure they’re handsome?” Xu Qinyin was cheered up.

“Of course!” Song Nan said.

“Why not!” Xu Qinyin agreed.

A dozen minutes later, they arrived. Coincidentally, Gu Ning had met one of them before.
