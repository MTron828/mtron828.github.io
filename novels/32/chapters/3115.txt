3117 Don’t You Like Me?

When they were eating, they barely chatted. Chu Jianan showed that he was tired, so Leng Yuqi didn’t say much about it.

However, she was worried. She felt that Chu Jianan was deliberately ignoring her.

After having the meal, Leng Yuqi packed the things up and walked to Chu Jianan. She sat next to him and leaned in his arms.

Chu Jianan hugged her, but felt no excitement when Leng Yuqi was in his arms. He hugged her for a long while, but did nothing.

She was in his arms, but Chu Jianan had no reaction, which disappointed Leng Yuqi. She wondered whether he had lost interest in her. If he was still interested in her, he wouldn’t be so calm when they met after so long.

He was different in the past.

However, it was hard for Leng Yuqi to initiate it. Even though she had slept with Chu Jianan many times, she still felt shy.

Chu Jianan understood what Leng Yuqi was thinking. He indeed couldn’t be aroused by Leng Yuqi, but still decided to try it.

Therefore, when Leng Yuqi almost lost her patience, Chu Jianan took action.

The foreplay was very short, and he soon penetrated her, but he was not excited and couldn’t help thinking of Jiang Yihan.

Therefore, Chu Jianan stopped five minutes later, leaving Leng Yuqi unsatisfied.

“J-Jianan, what happened?” asked Leng Yuqi.

Women were always sensitive, so she could see that Chu Jianan lost interest in her and she panicked.

“Nothing. I’m just tired,” Chu Jianan said.

“Jianan, I feel something is wrong between us. You don’t care about me now,” Leng Yuqi said. She couldn’t stand it when Chu Jianan ignored her, so she said hoping that Chu Jianan would be a loving boyfriend as usual.

“I’m busy these days. Didn’t I tell you?” Chu Jianan said impatiently.

He lost his patience for Leng Yuqi.

“But you should have time to reply to me no matter how busy you are. You used to do that. Whenever you saw my messages or calls, you would reply to me as soon as you were free,” Leng Yuqi said.

“Don’t be unreasonable! I was replying slowly, but I replied to you. I sometimes get tired, and I need alone time. I can’t send you messages or call you as soon as I have time,” Chu Jianan said angrily.

“But I can’t help wondering whether you’ve lost interest in me when you pay so little attention to me.” Leng Yuqi cried, feeling aggrieved when Chu Jianan showed his impatience for her.

In the past, Chu Jianan never did that nor would he lose his temper in front of her.

Chu Jianan used to like Leng Yuqi very much, so he treated her very well.

In the past, whenever Chu Jianan saw Leng Yuqi crying, he felt hurt too, but now he was only impatient.

Besides, Chu Jianan felt a little guilty when Leng Yuqi complained.

Women had an accurate sixth sense, so Leng Yuqi noticed it right after he betrayed her.

In fact, women reacted to men’s behavior. If men stayed loyal, women wouldn’t be sensitive.

“Why are girls thinking so much every day? Can’t you be optimistic? The National College Entrance Examination is around the corner, I think you should instead focus on reviews,” Chu Jianan said. No matter what happened between Leng Yuqi and him, he wouldn’t affect her before the National College Entrance Examination.

“Jianan, you’ll love me forever, right?” Leng Yuqi asked.

“I’ve already ended my engagement with Leng Xiaoyao. Isn’t that enough? I have emotions too. I’ve been humiliated by Leng Xiaoyao many times. I can never get over it. And I’m busy with work too. Can’t you understand when I’m in a bad mood and pay little attention to you? Can you give me some space to adjust myself? I really don’t want to vent my anger on you, but I’m in a terrible mood right now. I can’t calm down when you keep questioning me,” Chu Jianan said. He dodged Leng Yuqi’s question and defended himself with all kinds of reasons. He couldn’t say that he would love Leng Yuqi forever, because he didn’t believe it.

Leng Yuqi didn’t think much. She was very relieved after Chu Jianan said that to her.

Therefore, Leng Yuqi apologized at once. “I’m sorry, Jianan, it’s all my fault. I didn’t understand your feelings. I only cared about myself…”

“Alright, I won’t blame you. I also did something wrong, but the National College Entrance Examination is around the corner, you should instead focus on reviews. Try to get a high score. I need to work, so I don’t have much time to see you. Don’t think too much about it. We can meet after the National College Entrance Examination,” Chu Jianan said.

Chu Jianan implied that he had other intentions when he said they could meet after the exam, but Leng Yuqi didn’t get it.

Although Leng Yuxi felt there was something wrong between Chu Jianan and her, she didn’t think Chu Jianan had lost interest in her and betrayed her.

However, Leng Yuqi had stolen Chu Jianan from Leng Xiaoyao, so she deserved it when another girl stole Chu Jianan away from her.

“Fine, I’ll focus on reviews these days, but if you have time, remember to come see me, alright?” Leng Yuqi said.

“No problem.” Chu Jianan answered.

Leng Yuqi’s family didn’t know that she asked for leave from the evening class, so she needed to go back to school before the evening class was over and go back home in the Leng family’s car. In that way, her family wouldn’t know that she was absent from the evening class. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Chu Jianan drove Leng Yuqi to school. Actually, he didn’t want to do that, but it was too late, so he sent her back.

When Leng Yuqi arrived at school, the Leng family’s car was already there.

The evening class would be over in ten minutes, so Leng Yuqi sat in Chu Jianan’s car till it was over. When students swarmed out, Leng Yuqi got out of Chu Jianan’s car and got into the Leng family’s car.
