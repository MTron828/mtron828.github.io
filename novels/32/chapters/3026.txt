3027 Be Honest or Be Punished

Leng Xiaoyao saw a young man frequently get in and come out of Xi Keyi’s apartment, but the young man wasn’t Leng Yecheng.

After the young man walked into Xi Keyi’s apartment, he didn’t come out until the next day. It was a single apartment and they were alone together. Without further thinking, Leng Xiaoyao figured out what they were doing.

Upon thinking that Xi Keyi was dating another man while being Leng Yecheng’s girlfriend, Leng Xiaoyao was furious.

She didn’t know whether Leng Yecheng had slept with Xi Keyi. If not, it wouldn’t be a big deal. If they had, it would be disgusting. Xi Keyi was like a w*ore in Leng Xiaoyao’s eyes.

!!

However, before she had solid proof, Leng Xiaoyao had to curb her anger and continue to investigate it.

After that, Leng Xiaoyao found the young man’s face and took a screen-shot of him. Without delay, she searched for information about him.

Before long, she learned about who he was.

His name was Song Xiuyan. He was twenty-nine years old and was the general manager of Yuhua Model Management. He graduated from the Capital Finance University. It meant he graduated from the same university as Leng Yecheng.

Leng Xiaoyao investigated further on that, and it proved that they indeed graduated from the same university in the same year.

It seemed that Song Xiuyan was the mastermind who aimed to trap Leng Yecheng, but Leng Xiaoyao didn’t know whether there were any grudges between them.

If they had grudges in school, it would be hard for Leng Xiaoyao to know. She had to ask Leng Yecheng about it.

If they had grudges after they graduated, it might be easier to know what had happened between them. Leng Xiaoyao thought it was necessary for her to ask Leng Yecheng, but not now.

She needed to wait till tomorrow’s work was done.

If she asked Leng Yecheng right now, his mood would be affected, which would affect their business tomorrow.

It would be best if Leng Xiaoyao could get evidence of Xi Keyi’s abnormal relationship with Song Xiuyan.

In order to have evidence of their affair, Leng Xiaoyao needed to continue to watch Xi Keyi.

As a result, Leng Xiaoyao immediately hacked into the surveillance cameras and followed Xi Keyi after she left the hospital.

After Xi Keyi left the hospital, she directly returned to her apartment.

Because Xi Keyi walked into the apartment, Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t see her anymore, but she was alone inside as was shown in the surveillance video.

Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao had to continue to investigate.

At 3 pm, Ji Yanxi came.

Leng Yecheng didn’t share the news with Ji Yanxi and Han Yu at the beginning, so Ji Yanxi didn’t know about it until now and he came to see Leng Yecheng at once.

Han Yu was still recovering, so he didn’t come.

Coincidentally, Han Yu and Leng Yecheng became patients on the same day. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

In Leng Yecheng’s ward, Ji Yanxi saw Leng Xiaoyao and felt a lot more relieved, because he believed Leng Yecheng would be fine with Leng Xiaoyao’s help.

After watching Leng Xiaoyao do the operation for Han Yu, he was sure that she was skilled at medicine.

Because Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want Leng Yecheng to know that she had already met Ji Yanxis, she pretended that she didn’t know Ji Yanxi when he showed up. Ji Yanxi didn’t point it out. They didn’t “know” each other until Leng Yecheng made the introduction.

Ji Yanxi left after about ten minutes.

At 4 pm, Leng Xiaoyao went to Fengshang Design. It was 4:30 pm when she arrived, so it wasn’t time for them to be off work yet. Zhang Guanglin was still in his office.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care about it, and directly went into his office.

After Zhang Guanglin attacked Leng Yecheng, he was always anxious because he was afraid that he might be exposed.

Now Leng Xiaoyao suddenly came in, so Zhang Guanglin was scared, because he still remembered how aggressive Leng Xiaoyao was.

However, why did Leng Xiaoyao suddenly come to see him? Did she find anything?

No, that was impossible! He was very careful.

After Leng Xiaoyao went inside, she directly shut the door close behind her. The next second, she walked towards Zhang Guanglin. Zhang Guanglin shrank in horror and asked, “W-What do you want to do?”

Zhang Guanglin was too frightened to speak smoothly.

“To talk about something with you, Manager Zhang,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“What is it?” Zhang Guanglin asked. Although he didn’t know whether Leng Xiaoyao came here because of Leng Yecheng, it couldn’t be good news.

“About my third uncle,” Leng Xiaoyao said, looking at Zhang Guanglin with a vague smile, but she didn’t elaborate on that.

Upon hearing that it was about Leng Yecheng, Zhang Guanglin got nervous. Was he really exposed?

However, he still acted dumb. “W-What about Executive Leng?”

“Don’t be so nervous, Manager Zhang. It seems you know why I’m here.” Leng Xiaoyao put on a meaningful smile. She didn’t say why she came here, but asked him instead, which filled Zhang Guanglin with more anxiety.

“I-I’m nervous simply because I’m afraid you’ll beat me. I can’t read your face. How could I know why you’re here?” Zhang Guanglin argued, but even he didn’t believe his words.

“Since you’re afraid of being beaten by me. Why did you do such a thing?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

Such a thing? What thing?

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t say it, so Zhang Guanglin wouldn’t make a connection. “What is it? Be clear. Don’t pin strange blame on me!”

Did Leng Xiaoyao really know something? Or was she just suspicious of him? Was she trying to trick him into admitting the crime?

“Manager Zhang, I’m giving you a chance to be honest right now. Be honest, or be punished. If you refuse to be honest, I’ll deal with it seriously,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She only wasted time arguing with him to play psychological tactics.

“Miss Leng, if there is anything you want to say, don’t beat around the bush. If you’re not straightforward, how could I know what you’re talking about?” Zhang Guanglin said. He was scared of Leng Xiaoyao, but he was angry too since he felt Leng Xiaoyao was fooling him.

“Manager Zhang, don’t you know what you’ve done to my third uncle? Or do you think I’m trying to trick you into admitting the crime because I’m suspicious of you?” Leng Xiaoyao said meaningfully.

Hearing that, Zhang Guanglin was frightened and rounded his eyes in shock.

Leng Xiaoyao easily saw through him. Did it mean she really knew something and was not just tricking him?

However, before Leng Xiaoyao pointed it out, Zhang Guanglin still refused to admit it. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
