3348 The Li Family Again

Li Mochen woke up without waking up Leng Xiaoyao because she slept too late last night and was in a deep sleep at the moment.

Looking at Leng Xiaoyao’s beautiful face, Li Mochen was attracted and his heart ached a little for her. He must have worried her last night.

Li Mochen reached out and touched Leng Xiaoyao’s head, which immediately woke her up.

When Leng Xiaoyao opened her eyes and saw that Li Mochen had already woken up, she said, “Brother Mochen, you’re awake? You’ve successfully established your foundation. Do you remember what happened before?”

“Yeah, I’ve remembered everything. I’m sorry for waking you up. Why don’t you continue to sleep for a while? I’ll cook and call you when it’s ready?” Li Mochen said, feeling guilty for waking her up.

“It’s okay. I’m not sleepy now. Can you tell me a little about the Land Guiyun?” Leng Xiaoyao’s eager eyes stared at Li Mochen. She was extremely curious about it, and she couldn’t sleep any longer.

Looking at Leng Xiaoyao’s bright eyes, Li Mochen didn’t want to let her down! So he told Leng Xiaoyao everything he knew about Land Guiyun, which made her even more eager to go there.

These things were no longer just hearsay, but real experiences that affected Leng Xiaoyao’s emotions.

Although he had always been cold, he was clear about right and wrong. What Ling Feng had done made him angry and hateful. If he could really return, he would definitely pay Ling Feng back.

His grudges with Ling Feng had been accumulating for a long time, not just this time. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ling Feng failed to hurt him in the past, so he didn’t bother to teach him a lesson, but this time he was really mad.

“It turns out that you are a member of the royal family! That sounds amazing!” Leng Xiaoyao looked surprised, but also felt heartbroken about what Li Mochen had been through.

At the age of eleven, his father died in battle and his mother passed away due to grief. He wandered alone and met the disciples of the Tiancheng Sect by accident.

It was already like this in Land Guiyun. Why did it have to be the same in this incarnation too?

His parents died early. He was bullied by his family, and left his home.

What was better than this incarnation was that Li Mochen still had an uncle to protect him in Land Guiyun. He left the palace secretly.

“By the way, since you’ve regained your memories, do you want to visit City Qin with me?” asked Leng Xiaoyao. Since Li Mochen regained his memories, it was necessary for them to meet Leng Yan and the others.

“Sure! Do you have time to go?” When Li Mochen remembered everything he had been through, the first thing he thought of was going to City Qin. He didn’t want to avoid Leng Xiaoyao. After all, he learned about this because of her.

“Of course! I will definitely have time. I’ll just tell my grandfather that I’ll be back later,” Leng Xiaoyao said. After writing the test, she had plenty of time.

Although it was unfilial to not stay at home with Leng Changyuan during the holiday, she also had her own things to do. After coming back from City Qin this time, she would spend more time with Leng Changyuan.

Therefore, Li Mochen immediately booked a flight to City Qin that day, without bringing Mu Yuan and Meng Fan. He told them to go back to the Wolf Gang. Only he would go with Leng Xiaoyao.

Once Li Mochen booked the flight to City Qin, the Li family knew about it.

Li Zongquan was still unwilling to give up, so he sent people to follow them.

This time, they weren’t discovered by the person who was arranged to monitor the Li family. After all, Li Zongquan wasn’t stupid enough to send people directly from his side when he knew that he was being monitored by Li Mochen.

However, Li Zongquan still underestimated Li Mochen’s ability. When they arrived at the airport of City Qin, Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao noticed that they were being followed.

“Is it the Li family again?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“I don’t know. No need to worry about it for now. It’s better if they follow us into the mountain,” Li Mochen said. Because he had many enemies, not only the Li family would try to harm him, it could also be anyone who had a grudge against him.

Therefore, the two of them ignored it.

After arriving in City Qin, it was around 5 pm. They went to eat first, then went directly to their destination. Those who followed them kept following them.

They didn’t know why Li Mochen went into the mountain. They were worried that it was because he found out that they were following him and deliberately led them into the mountain.

They also suspected that Li Mochen might have some secrets that couldn’t be revealed and were discovered by them.

Whether they found out about him or he found out about them, they couldn’t retreat because of it.

It was a good thing that they entered the mountain. Once they entered, they could take action.

Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t possibly wait for them to follow them to the destination. Once they entered the mountain and confirmed that there was no one else around, Li Mochen directly opened his mouth.

“Come out now!”

Upon hearing that, the hidden people were surprised, but they had already guessed it, so it wasn’t too unexpected.

Anyway, they were also ready to take action. Since Li Mochen said it first, they didn’t need to hide any longer.

There were only four men, but even if there were ten men, Li Mochen wouldn’t take them seriously.

After they approached, Li Mochen directly took action and knocked them all down in seconds. They could barely fight back.

After successfully building his foundation, Li Mochen’s power was more than ten times stronger than before. He was even more powerful than Leng Xiaoyao after only building the foundation.

Those men were stunned. They hadn’t even taken action yet!

Looking at Li Mochen, they felt like they were looking at a monster. Who could move so fast? Even if he was powerful, he shouldn’t be so fast!

“Tell me, who sent you?” Li Mochen asked calmly, not angry, but imposing, making the four men feel overwhelmed.

However, they couldn’t reveal the mastermind behind the scenes, so they remained silent.

This time, Li Mochen wouldn’t let them go easily. He directly used cruel means to interrogate them. For them, it was better to die than to live. It was more painful and uncomfortable than being killed directly.

Finally, someone couldn’t stand it and said that it was Li Zongquan.

“It seems that Master Li isn’t very smart! Doesn’t he learn from his mistakes?” Leng Xiaoyao sneered. Even if he didn’t learn from his mistakes the first time, he should have learned from the second time!

However, it happened again and again…

If the people he sent were more powerful, such as those professional assassins, they would be much more skilled than these men!

These men were strong, but they had only undergone professional training, not devil training.

Their training was either hitting a wooden stake by themselves or fighting with their companions. In that case, their actions were limited and they didn’t have the determination to go all out.

As for assassins? They struggled from a pile of dead bodies in order to live. Hundreds of people were thrown into a forest and only a few survived. If they didn’t kill others, they would be killed by others, so they were violent.
