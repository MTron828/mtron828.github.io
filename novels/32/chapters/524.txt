Chapter 525 Expand the Factory

There were far more pieces of large jade than the jade jewelry they had seen in the store and the piles of jade must be worth a fortune!

“Ningning, how much are these piles of jade worth?” Gu Qing asked.

“Jade is very valuable, but actually it’s just a stone if nobody wants it. As long as we can sell them out, they’re worth over hundreds of millions of yuan. However, if we can’t, they’re just piles of stones. It isn’t necessary anyway,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, both Gu Qing and Gu Man took a long breath in. Over hundreds of millions of yuan!

In fact, Gu Ning’s wealth was far more than that. And her goal was to be the No.1 super-rich woman in the country.

Gu Qinyang wouldn’t be home until 6 pm, so Gu Ning and the others spent the afternoon in the factory. In the meantime, Gu Ning discussed with Zhou Zhenghong about opening branches of Jade Beauty Jewelry. Leng Shaoting, on the other hand, sat aside remaining quiet. Even though he did nothing, he didn’t feel bored as long as Gu Ning was by his side.

Gu Qing and Gu Man were very curious about everything in the factory, so the tour was quite interesting in their eyes.

“The decoration is coming to an end in City B, so we can prepare for the opening ceremony in a week at the most. How is the jewelry now?” Gu Ning asked.

Although the branches opened almost at the same time in the capital and City B, Gu Ning decided to open the branch in City B first, because they had prepared everything there. All they needed now was well-made jade jewelry.

As for the gowns, although Yu Zi couldn’t make 11 new sets, she had already finished five, and would use some old designs to complete the rest.

Gu Ning understood that she seemed a little cold-blooded, because she was busy dealing with her business when Tang Yunfan was still unconscious. However, she still had to live her life and chase her dream. In addition, it was Tang Aining’s soul in Gu Ning’s body. Although she accepted Tang Yunfan as her father, she didn’t have many feelings towards him.

Tang Yunfan was still unconscious, but his body was in good condition so Gu Ning wasn’t very worried about his life.

“We’ve hired more workers, and it’s almost done,” Zhou Zhenghong said. “Boss, can we rent the 200 square meter large factory next door? This factory we’re using now is a little small.”

“Sure.” Gu Ning agreed.

When it was almost 5 pm, Gu Ning and the others left the factory.

Before they left, Gu Ning took a set of jewelry along with a jade pixiu, which were gifts for Wen Yulan and Gu Qinyang. They also went to a supermarket to buy some fruits on their way to Gu Qinyang’s place.

Since Leng Shaoting needed to send Gu Qing and Gu Man back to the apartment later, Gu Man invited him to join the dinner. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Mom, I’m having a gathering with my friends this evening, so I won’t be coming back to the apartment tonight,” Gu Ning said to Gu Man.

“Will Shaoting go with you?” Gu Man asked.

“Sure! We’re going to meet our mutual friends. They are all from either rich or powerful families, and it’s helpful to my business,” Gu Ning lied without hesitation.

“Great.” Gu Man didn’t doubt Gu Ning at all. Moreover, there was only one bed in the apartment. Gu Ning would have to sleep on the sofa if she stayed in the apartment with them.

Leng Shaoting, on the other hand, smiled a little with satisfaction.

Gu Man and Gu Qing didn’t notice Leng Shaoting’s reaction but Gu Ning did. She rolled her eyes at him. Why are men always thinking about having sex?

Nevertheless, Gu Ning also understood that a man stopped loving you if he didn’t have any sexual desire for you. Although it sounds a little embarrassing, Gu Ning had to admit that she sometimes wanted sex too.

Gu Ning and the others knocked on the door of Gu Qinyang’s place around 6 pm, and Gu Qinyang was already home.

When Gu Qinyang opened the door and saw that they came with many packages, he felt embarrassed. “You didn’t need to bring so many gifts!”

Afterwards, Gu Qinyang invited them to walk inside, and he was stunned by Leng Shaoting’s outstanding appearance when Leng Shaoting walked by him. “This is?” he asked Gu Ning.

“Oh, he’s my friend, Leng Shaoting and he’s our private chauffeur for the two days we are in City F,” Gu Ning said.

“Nice to meet you, Mr. Leng!” Gu Qinyang greeted him politely.

“Nice to meet you!” Leng Shaoting said.

Wen Yulan went grocery shopping, and wasn’t home yet, while Gu Yinyin and Gu Qingshi were watching TV in the living room.

Seeing them walking inside, Gu Yinyin and Gu Qingshi didn’t show any pride like they had done before but felt uneasy. Although Gu Yinyin and Gu Qingshi didn’t have good characters, they weren’t little kids after all so they understood that things were different

now.

Gu Qinyang and their mother had already told them about what had happened to Gu Xiaoxiao and the fact that Gu Ning was the real boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry so neither Gu Yinyin nor Gu Qingshi dared to laugh at Gu Ning anymore.

They also received thick red envelopes from Gu Qing and Gu Man. Upon thinking about what they had done before, they felt ashamed.

When they were all seated, Gu Qinyang criticized Gu Yinyin and Gu Qingshi because they hadn’t greeted Gu Man and the others yet. “Hey, you two don’t forget your manners!”

Gu Qinyang had reminded them beforehand, but they suddenly remained so quiet now. Hearing that, both of them greeted Gu Man and Gu Qing with embarrassment.

“Ha-ha, it’s fine.” Gu Qing and Gu Man didn’t mind that they had been rude to them before. After all, they were just children.
