Although Zhang Zikai told them it was scary, and he knew it would definitely be scarier than the haunted houses he had been to before, he was still surprised by its degree of horror.

“Yeah, it’s even scarier than I thought,” said Chu Peihan. Her body was still trembling in fear, and she had the same feeling as Hao Ran.

​

“Zihan, come to my place and sleep with me tonight, or I’ll be scared going home alone,” said Zhang Zikai to Shao Zihan all of a sudden. Although there were bright lights along her way home, she was reluctant to be alone in the car.

“Sure,” said Shao Zihan. She also didn’t want Zhang Zikai to go home alone after sending her back home. What if any accidents happened?

“Do you need us to protect you?” Gu Ning asked with concern.

“Thanks, but don’t bother. It’s not that serious actually. I’m fine in Zihan’s company,” said Zhang Zikai. She rejected but not because she was worried that Gu Ning might find out where she lived and her family background; she simply didn’t want to bother Gu Ning.

In addition, it wasn’t that serious. Even though she was still afraid, there were bright lights along the way and it was still early so there was a lot of traffic on the road.

“Great.” Since Zhang Zikai didn’t need her help, Gu Ning didn’t insist.

After they rested for a while, they left.

“What do you want to do tomorrow?” Gu Ning asked her friends on their way back.

Hao Ran and the others would go back the day after tomorrow, so they only had a day left to enjoy themselves here.

“Of course the Great Wall. What a shame if we don’t visit the Great Wall after we come to the capital,” said Chu Peihan.

“No problem.” Gu Ning agreed.

After driving Hao Ran and the others back to Shengshi Hotel, Gu Ning went to Century City.

It wasn’t very late when she got back to Century City, and it was only 11 pm.

Leng Shaoting called her at 11 pm every day, because he could only be free at this time. He would either be in the Leng family’s old house, or talking with Jing Yunyao before that.

Gu Ning went to bed after having a conversation with Leng Shaoting. Because it was late she decided to let the male ghost stay in her telepathic eye space for a while. She would deal with it someday when she had time.

The next day, Gu Ning didn’t go running, instead she exercised in the yard. Afterwards, she tested Chu Peihan’s fighting skills.

Chu Peihan was undoubtedly better than Yu Mixi, because she had received professional training. However, Chu Peihan was still no comparable to Gu Ning. Anyway, she was able to defeat over 10 ordinary men now.

Among them, other than Gu Ning, Chu Peihan was the best at martial arts.

After that, they went to pack up and had breakfast in the Shengshi Hotel, then went to see Hao Ran and the other boys.

It took nearly two hours from here to the Great Wall, and it was the rush hour, so there was a little traffic jam on the road.

...

After having breakfast, Jing Yunyao began to teach Leng Shaoting kung fu.

Although he already had a private teacher, Jing Yunyao would still teach him more skills, because it would only do him good.

Leng Shaoting told Jing Yunyao that they would meet Shangguan Yang together tomorrow after Gu Ning’s friends finished their trip in the capital.

Since Jing Yunyao and Leng Shaoting already accepted each other, it was time for Jing Yunyao to meet Shangguan Yang.

Leng Shaoting soon got familiar with the kung fu skills Jing Yunyao taught him, leaving Jing Yunyao amazed by his ability again. She also felt quite proud of him.

Since Leng Shaoting was already a cultivator, Jing Yunyao hoped that he could go up in the levels of his cultivation as soon as possible. Therefore, since Jing Yunyao was free these days, she was busy teaching Leng Shaoting kung fu.

Because Leng Shaoting’s cultivation was still at a low level, he couldn’t learn magic for the time being.

A real cultivator needed to learn magic and martial arts at the same time, because it would generate more powerful energy after being combined.

Two hours later, Jing Yunyao and Leng Shaoting stopped practicing kung fu and went to the Leng family’s old house.

Jiang Shuyuan couldn’t sleep at all last night because of Jing Yunyao. She was full of anxiety. Luckily, Jiang Shuyuan went to work in the morning, so Jing Yunyao didn’t see her when she arrived at the Leng family’s old house.

Yu Yin should go to work too, but she asked for a day off in case Jing Yunyao felt uneasy being the only woman left in the Leng family’s old house.

Yesterday was Sunday, so Leng Yuanjin’s family already went back home.

After having lunch in the Leng family’s old house, Yu Yin and Jing Yunyao went to shop together, while Leng Shaoting stayed with Master Leng at home.

He hadn’t stayed with Master Leng for a long time, especially after Gu Ning became his girlfriend, because he left to see Gu Ning once he was free.

Normally, members of the Leng family left the house with bodyguards, because they were very important and had many enemies who always wanted to hurt them. However, with Jing Yunyao by Yu Yin’s side, there was no need for them to go out with bodyguards today. Jing Yunyao was able to defeat dozens of strong men after all.

Only Leng Shaoting knew the real reason why Jing Yunyao was so strong, but the other members of the Leng family also knew that she wasn’t weak at all.

Although Jing Yunyao had Leng Shaoting’s card, Leng Shaoting was still worried that she might not use it. As a result, he turned to Yu Yin for help and hoped that Yu Yin could encourage Jing Yunyao to buy anything she liked without caring about the prices.

Yu Yin took Jing Yunyao to the commercial zone, where there were several large shopping malls, including Fengshang Shopping Mall which was owned by the Tang family.

When they entered Fengshang Shopping Mall, Yu Yin said to Jing Yunyao, “Oh, do you know that Fengshang Shopping Mall is owned by Gu Ning’s family?”

“What? It’s owned by Gu Ning’s family?” Jing Yunyao was shocked. She knew that Gu Ning had many companies, but she didn’t know Fengshang Shopping Mall was one of them. In fact, she still didn’t know much about Gu Ning.

Gu Ning didn’t bother to keep her family background secret from Jing Yunyao, but she was busy having fun with her friends these days and Jing Yunyao stayed in the Leng family’s old house, so they didn’t have much time to talk about it.

“It’s owned by Gu Ning’s father. Her father is from the richest family, the Tang family, in City B,” said Yu Yin.

“The Tang family in City B? Gu Ning’s family in the richest Tang family in City B? Why is her surname Gu, instead of Tang?” asked Jing Yunyao with confusion.
