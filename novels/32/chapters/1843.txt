Chapter 1845: Because I Have Grudge Against You

Because there weren’t many pedestrians in this section, not too many people were watching them.

Even if there were a few onlookers, nobody came forward to stop the fight. After all, these gangsters were notorious in this area and many people knew that they were very fierce. Whoever dared to interfere in their business would be punished, unless it was someone they didn’t dare to mess with.

All the onlookers were just ordinary people, so they all watched from the side.

Normally, Leng Shaoting would do something if he encountered such a thing, so he parked the car by the side of the road and wanted to get out of the car to have a look.

Gu Ning, however, suddenly stopped him. “Wait a sec.”

“What’s wrong?” Leng Shaoting asked with confusion.

Gu Ning squinted her eyes saying in a flat voice, “We don’t need to help the man. He’s Qi Ziyue. I thought Tang Bingsen had already killed Qi Ziyue, but unexpectedly he’s still alive.”

What she didn’t know was that Tang Bingsen was worried that “Tang Aining” might collect evidence if he killed Qi Ziyue, which would put him into a dangerous situation.

In fact, after Tang Bingsen got seriously sick and lost control of the Tang Organization, the guards ran away. It took Qi Ziyue a lot of effort to break free from the rope that bound him and escape.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was annoyed and stopped. “Should we leave or watch him for a while?”

“Let’s stay here for a while,” Gu Ning said.

Seeing Qi Ziyue in a lot of pain and despair from being punched and kicked, Gu Ning only felt a surge of excitement and joy.

She knew that Qi Ziyue had been caught by Tang Bingsen, but she didn’t know where Tang Bingsen had him locked up. She originally planned to ask Tang Bingsen where Qi Ziyue was after military training, but surprisingly she met him here by chance.

Those gangsters cursed as they beat Qi Ziyue, then left when they were done.

Actually, Qi Ziyue was innocent to some extent. He had only accidentally bumped into these gangsters who were slightly drunk. Although Qi Ziyue bumped them, it wasn’t something serious, and he apologized right away. Unfortunately these gangsters were in a bad mood, so they refused to forgive him.

At the beginning, they wanted to force Qi Ziyue to give them money, but Qi Ziyue just escaped from the dark room. He had no money in his pockets and was also starving.

Because he had no money, he was beaten by a bunch of gangsters.

After those gangsters left, the onlookers also dispersed. No one bothered to call the police or an ambulance.

Gu Ning didn’t get out of the car until many people were gone.

“Do you need me to go with you?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“No need, just wait for me in the car,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure,” Leng Shaoting replied.

After Gu Ning got out of the car, she walked towards Qizi.

Qi Ziyue was beaten severely. To be specific, he was seriously injured, with two broken ribs. In this case, if he didn’t receive any treatment, he could die.

Gu Ning walked over, not trying to save him. She couldn’t wait to see him die.

She walked to him simply to gloat over his failure and add insult to injury.

“Qi Ziyue, can you believe what you’ve been through today?” Gu Ning walked up to Qi Ziyue and said with mockery.

Although Qi Ziyue was heavily beaten, he was still conscious. Hearing Gu Ning’s voice, he suddenly raised his head and looked at her.

Seeing Gu Ning, Qi Ziyue was slightly startled with a frown. “It’s you?”

Qi Ziyue said that not because he knew what he had been through today had something to do with Gu Ning, but because he didn’t expect to see her here.

Qi Ziyue felt utterly embarrassed when she saw him like this. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Even though he didn’t know that Gu Ning had pushed him into such a miserable situation, he still felt humiliated because there was a long-standing grudge between them and she looked at him with obvious mockery.

“Don’t you feel I have always been inexplicably hostile towards you?” Gu Ning asked with a smile, but the smile was completely cold.

Hearing that, Qi Ziyue was taken aback. Actually, he really felt so.

“Let me tell you, it’s because I have a grudge against you, and Tang Aining is actually me,” Gu Ning said. At this time, there was no need to keep it secret from him anymore, because he could do nothing about it even if he learned the truth.

“What?” Qi Ziyue rounded his eyes in shock. He couldn’t believe his ears.

Tang Aining is actually Gu Ning?

“You, who are you? What’s your relationship with Tang Aining?” Qi Ziyue asked.

“Me? I’m Gu Ning!” Gu Ning said, with a faint smile on the corners of her mouth, which seemed harmless on the surface.

“If I tell you Tang Aining told me that you killed her in my dream and she asked me to avenge her, would you believe it?” Gu Ning asked.

“No, it’s impossible. It’s impossible!” Qi Ziyue refused to believe it. There couldn’t be such a ridiculous thing in the world! The only possibility was that Gu Ning knew Tang Aining.

Besides, how did Gu Ning know that Tang Aining was killed by him? Even Tang Aining herself didn’t figure out his real purpose of becoming her boyfriend before she died.

Tang Aining even thought it was just a trip when they went to the sea that time.

It didn’t make sense if Gu Ning was Tang Aining’s friend.

Was it possible that Tang Aining told Gu Ning everything in a dream?

It was hard for Qi Ziyue to believe.

“Do you still refuse to believe it?” Gu Ning asked, but the answer actually couldn’t be more obvious. After that, Gu Ning said with a smile, “Did you forget what I said at your wedding? When you were on the yacht, Tang Yaxin said something to Tang Aining...”

Hearing that, Qi Ziyue’s body suddenly shook a little. He looked at Gu Ning in horror and his eyeballs seemed about to fall out.

“Who are you? Tell me who you are!” Qi Zi asked. At this moment, he lost his mind. He somehow felt that Gu Ning in front of him was actually Tang Aining. If she wasn’t Tang Aining, how could she know what Tang Yaxin had said? She knew every word!

Qi Ziyue thought that Gu Ning might be Tang Aining, but he also felt that it was impossible. He was so confused that he said to himself, “No, no, no, you can’t be Tang Aining, Tang Aining must have told you those words. Tang Aining isn’t dead, right? You are not Tang Aining. You are not Tang Aining.”

“Well,” Gu Ning just sneered. Without another word, she released more and more magical power to freeze Qi Ziyue.

Afterwards, she left.

Gu Ning had the idea of beating him up in person, but they were in public after all. It would cause her trouble if anyone saw it and took photos of them then posted them on the Internet.

Gu Ning got into the car and left with Leng Shaoting.

Witnessing Qi Ziyue’s tragic life now, Gu Ning was in a good mood.
