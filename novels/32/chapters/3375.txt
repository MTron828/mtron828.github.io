3378 I Don’t Make Friends Randomly

Lin Xiyuan soon found out about it and was very angry.

Damn, it was filmed.

Although she resented Yu Yanwei in her heart, she dared not get angry at him.

As for these things, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t know nor care. They stayed at the racecourse until 5 pm, then left to have dinner.

Tao Zheng and the others all knew that Li Mochen had high standards. Since Leng Xiaoyao could follow Li Mochen, and their relationship was so intimate, they understood that Li Mochen valued Leng Xiaoyao very much, so they also respected her.

If it were someone like Yu Yanwei, the women next to him were basically played with for money. Such women wouldn’t be respected.

They would even be despised.

Leng Xiaoyao was never a timid person. Facing Li Mochen’s friends, she remained calm and composed from beginning to end. No matter what they spoke about, she could join in the conversation.

Tao Zheng and the others knew that a woman who could stand by Li Mochen’s side wasn’t ordinary, and her knowledge made them even more aware of her extraordinariness.

They also learned that Leng Xiaoyao was the national liberal arts champion of the National College Entrance Examination, only one point away from being the national champion.

After knowing Leng Xiaoyao’s age, it surprised them even more because Leng Xiaoyao’s behavior and demeanor gave them the feeling that she wasn’t just a high school graduate.

After dinner, Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen refused Tao Zheng and the others’ invitation to go to the club and went back to Hanlin Manor.

Because they were too full from dinner, they took a walk after getting out of the car at home.

Just then, Jiang Xiaoxiao and her mother were also taking a walk, so they saw Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen next to her.

Jiang Xiaoxiao was attracted to Li Mochen at first glance. He was so handsome!

Then she frowned. What was the relationship between Leng Xiaoyao and this man?

Once again, she felt jealous of Leng Xiaoyao.

Leng Xiaoyao naturally saw Jiang Xiaoxiao and noticed her jealousy, but she ignored her directly. After all, they weren’t familiar with each other.

Jiang’s mother noticed something wrong with Jiang Xiaoxiao and asked, “Xiaoxiao, what’s wrong?”

“Nothing,” Jiang Xiaoxiao said without telling her mother her thoughts.

After Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen walked away, Li Mochen asked her, “Did that girl have a conflict with you?”

It wasn’t that Li Mochen paid attention to other women, but Jiang Xiaoxiao’s hostility towards Leng Xiaoyao was too obvious to ignore.

“The last time I took An Chenmeng and the others to walk around outside the Capital University, we encountered her, a mad dog biting people. We argued for a while, but I didn’t expect that she also lives here,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t care about it. If she came to find trouble with her again, she wouldn’t be polite.

If she didn’t cause her any trouble, Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t pay attention to her.

“If anyone dares to cause you trouble, you don’t need to hesitate to fight back. As long as no one is killed, I can help you with it. Even if someone is killed, I could still help cover it up, but it’ll be a little troublesome. I know you won’t be so cruel,” said Li Mochen. He was willing to support Leng Xiaoyao and help her solve her problems.

Upon hearing that, Leng Xiaoyao would be lying if she said that she wasn’t moved. “Okay, I’ll turn to you for help if there’s trouble.”

This was the capital city. Many people were beyond her reach. After all, this place wasn’t like Guiyun where the strong were respected. There whoever had the strongest fist would have the final say, but this was a legal society where laws and rights were supreme. If she offended someone with high status or power, she might be fine personally, but she still had family members who would be in endless trouble.

Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t look down on anyone just because of her outstanding abilities.

In her previous incarnation, not only did she have abilities, she also had a family background that few people could match. She didn’t look down on anyone then either.

“Where do you want to go tomorrow?” Li Mochen asked.

“How about we find a remote place to cultivate tomorrow?” Leng Xiaoyao said. Besides practicing with Li Mochen, she really didn’t know what else to do!

“Okay.” Li Mochen agreed.

They walked around the community for a while and sat for a while before returning home around 10 pm.

On the way back, Li Mochen directly took Leng Xiaoyao’s hand. Leng Xiaoyao struggled a few times, but failed to break free. She said irritably, “I haven’t agreed to be your girlfriend yet! Why are you holding my hand?”

“It’s just holding hands, not kissing,” Li Mochen said, thick-skinned.

“You…” Leng Xiaoyao felt nervous and her heart was beating irregularly.

Anyway, since she couldn’t break free, she stopped struggling.

She wanted to break free, not because she hated holding hands with him, but because she felt uneasy.

Li Mochen walked her to the door of her house. Looking at Leng Xiaoyao, Li Mochen was excited. Especially when his eyes fell on her pretty lips, he really wanted to kiss her.

Whether Leng Xiaoyao realized it or was afraid of what might happen, she broke free from Li Mochen’s hand and ran inside.

Watching Leng Xiaoyao’s fleeing figure, Li Mochen smiled bitterly. He didn’t know how long he had to wait before he could make her accept him.

It seemed to be a long way with challenges!

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t have the habit of sleeping early. After returning home, she took a shower, changed into her pajamas, and started working. She didn’t sleep until 2 am.

The next day, Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen went for a morning run and met Jiang Xiaoxiao. She was also running.

Jiang Xiaoxiao couldn’t take her eyes off Li Mochen when she saw him. She looked hesitant and took a deep breath before walking towards Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Leng Xiaoyao, I’m sorry for my rude words outside the gate of the Capital University last time. I was in a bad mood and my emotions were out of control. I hope you won’t hold it against me!” Jiang Xiaoxiao apologized to Leng Xiaoyao in a gentle and friendly manner.

If Jiang Xiaoxiao had apologized when she met An instead of causing a fight, Leng Xiaoyao might have thought that Jiang Xiaoxiao’s apology was sincere.

However, this time Jiang Xiaoxiao obviously came because of Li Mochen. How could Leng Xiaoyao believe that she really wanted to apologize?

Despite that, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t show any anger and replied calmly and distantly. “It’s okay. I’ve let it go a long time ago.”

If Jiang Xiaoxiao provoked her again, she wouldn’t be polite.

After hearing Leng Xiaoyao say that she had let it go, Jiang Xiaoxiao breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank you. Can we be friends? We will soon be alumni, and we both live in Hanlin Manor. We can go to school and come home together in the future!”

“I’m sorry, I don’t make friends randomly. If we have chances to meet in the future, we might become friends,” Leng Xiaoyao said. The first part was true, but the latter part was just a perfunctory response.

“We gotta go,” Leng Xiaoyao said without waiting for Jiang Xiaoxiao to say anything else. She ran away with Li Mochen.

Jiang Xiaoxiao wanted to chase after them, but felt embarrassed to do so.
