Chapter 1281: Help Du Jingtong

Gu Ning took out her phone at once to search for the news about Du Jingtong. She soon found out a lot of news about the horrible news and there were many photos of the injured Du Jingtong on the Internet as well.

Although Du Jingtong’s face was pixelated, Gu Ning still recognized her. Du Jingtong’s real name was also in the headlines too. She was stabbed in the heart, so her life was in great danger now.

After making sure of it, Gu Ning called Li Zhongwei without hesitation.

“Hi, Miss Gu, may I help?” Li Zhongwei was surprised that Gu Ning would call him all of a sudden.

“Mr. Li, I just read a piece of news on the Internet about Du Jingtong. How’s she now?” Gu Ning asked.

“Not good,” Li Zhongwei sounded sad. “She has been in the emergency room for six hours, and her life was saved, but she’s still unconscious now.”

“Where is she? I need to visit her,” Gu Ning said.

Li Zhongwei knew that Gu Ning didn’t get along with Du Jingtong, so he was surprised when Gu Ning said that. Anyway, since Gu Ning was willing to visit Du Jingtong, it meant that she didn’t bear grudges.

Li Zhongwei then told Gu Ning the address of the hospital where Du Jingtong was.

At this time, Li Zhongwei and several of his colleagues were also in the hospital, so he decided to wait for Gu Ning.

Gu Ning and her two bodyguards took a taxi to the hospital right away. She left her suitcase in the restaurant and would pick it up later.

Because Gao Yi and Qiao Ya stayed by her sides, it wasn’t convenient for her to put her stuff in the telepathic eye space.

...

In an intensive care single room, Du Jingtong was lying on the patient bed with a pale face and weak breath. A middle-aged woman who was her mother sat next to her.

Du Jingtong’s mother hadn’t slept for two days and looked very haggard.

Li Zhongwei and his colleagues stood outside, because they weren’t allowed to stay in the intensive care room for long.

In fact, Li Zhongwei’s colleagues could leave before him, but they insisted on waiting for Gu Ning. Gu Ning was their idol and they wanted to see her again. It also wasn’t time for them to go to work yet.

Li Zhongwei said nothing about it, and let them stay.

About 20 minutes later, Gu Ning, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya showed up.

“Hi, Miss Gu, nice to see you again!” they excitedly greeted her at once.

“Hi, nice to see you all.” Gu Ning also politely greeted them.

After that, Li Zhongwei walked into the ward with Gu Ning.

The others, instead, stayed outside.

“Mrs. Du, this is Miss Gu, and she came to see Jingtong,” Li Zhongwei said to Du Jingtong’s mother.

“Nice to meet you, Miss Gu. Thank you so much for coming here,” Mrs. Du said.

She thought that Gu Ning must be Du Jingtong’s friend.

“My pleasure,” Gu Ning said. “Mrs. Du, I can actually help Du Jingtong recover as fast as possible, but are you willing to trust me?”

Even though Gu Ning had the thought to help Du Jingtong, she still needed to ask for her family’s permission. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“What?” Hearing that, not only were Mrs. Du and Li Zhongwei shocked, but the doctor in the ward was too.

“Who are you, and who do you think you are? The most experienced doctor in our hospital has checked Du Jingtong’s wound in person and even he said that Du Jingtong’s life is still in danger now,” the doctor said.

Mrs. Du felt heart-broken. In fact, she didn’t believe that Gu Ning was able to help Du Jingtong make a full recovery, but she still had hope. She hoped that Du Jingtong could wake up again as soon as possible.

“I said that I can help her and I mean it. No matter what will happen, I’ll bear the responsibility,” Gu Ning said with a serious expression.

“Can you?” the doctor snorted with disdain.

Gu Ning ignored him, and turned to look at Mrs. Du. “Mrs. Du, I promise that I can help your daughter wake up again, and the probability is above 90%. If you trust me, please allow me to have a try. If you don’t, I can leave right now.”

“Ridiculous, do you think that you can do magic?” The doctor laughed at Gu Ning again before Mrs. Du said anything.

It was his duty not to let other people touch the patient, but his verbal abuse made Gu Ning feel utterly displeased. However, he was a doctor and he was protecting Du Jingtong, so Gu Ning didn’t bother to argue with him.

“I trust you,” Mrs. Du said all of a sudden.

Mrs. Du served in the police system too, and she was a senior official. She saw confidence and determination in Gu Ning’s eyes, so she chose to believe Gu Ning. Although she still had doubt, she wanted to have a try, because she hated to see her daughter waiting to die on the hospital bed. She didn’t want to lose her beloved daughter.
