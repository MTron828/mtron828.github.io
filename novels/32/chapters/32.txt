Chapter 33: Ain’t Going to Apologize

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning felt like laughing. She argued him back with the same theory, “In that case, what has happened just then can also be forgiven, right?”

Then, Qin Zheng had no reason to blame her.

Qin Zheng was dissatisfied, but wasn’t able to argue back. Gu Xiaoxiao, on the contrary, felt aggrieved. It was impossible that she would forgive Gu Ning.

“Gu Ning, you dare to throw the plate to me! You can never get away with it!” Gu Xiaoxiao said with obvious hatred, throwing a plate on a table to Gu Ning directly.

They stood so close. There was no way to stop it. Everyone was watching the plate flying to Gu Ning.

Though Gu Ning had shown her ability just then, others were still worried that Gu Ning wouldn’t be able to escape away from the plate, because the distance was so short.

However, before everyone could see it clearly, bam, the plate was broken. All of them were amazed by the scene before them.

Gu Ning even hit the plate, which was quickly flying to her, with a fist. The plate was hit broken afterwards, while Gu Ning’s hand stayed the same.

“Wow, holy awesome!” Mu Ke looked at Gu Ning with admiration. He couldn’t describe how much he admired Gu Ning now.

Everyone acclaimed as well.

“You, you...” Gu Xiaoxiao was literally scared this time. She stepped backwards at once, staring at Gu Ning in horror, like she was looking at a beast.

How come? How was it possible? Since when Gu Ning had become so powerful?

“Gu Xiaoxiao, I’ve warned you yesterday to stay away from me. You didn’t listen. Since you won’t leave me alone, I’m willing to have a little fun,” Gu Ning said coldly.

“You...” Gu Xiaoxiao apparently was frightened by Gu Ning. She gave up for now, but still felt displeased. She said viciously, “Gu Ning, I’m going to tell my dad and grandma that you’ve bullied me. I’ll let grandma kick you all out of the old house. I want you all to be homeless!”

Gu Xiaoxiao was the center in her family. If she insisted, her grandma probably would follow her order.

“We don’t live in the old house for free. We pay the rent. We can live wherever we want after we leave the old house.” Gu Ning didn’t care at all. She didn’t plan to stay in there for much longer anyway.

If they were going to move out of the old house today, she and Gu Man would stay in the hotel first. When she came back from City G, she would immediately buy a new house.

“Boss, you don’t need to worry. I can help you find a house,” Mu Ke supported Gu Ning.

“You...” Gu Xiaoxiao was more than annoyed now. She clenched her teeth, and said, “Fine, very well, Gu Ning, let’s go and see. You will regret!”

Then, she glared at Gu Ning, turning around and left. She even ignored Qin Zheng and other friends.

Chen Ziyao was also displeased to see that Gu Ning had survived. She glared at Gu Ning too.

Qin Zheng, Zhang Yiming and Fu Mingliang were all unhappy. They gave Gu Ning and Mu Ke a meaningful glance, then were gone as well.

When they were all gone, the crowd dispersed gradually. Gu Ning and her friends felt disgusted at first, but then cheered up by eating.

Gu Xiaoxiao immediately called her mother after she left. Gu Xiaoxiao’s mother, Lin Lijuan, was a pushy woman who cared about her own daughter only. Hearing her daughter had been bullied, Lin Lijuan was in a rage.

Gu Xiaoxiao added fuel on flames. She told her mother that Gu Ning had picked up a rich boy, behaved immorally and so forth.

Lin Lijuan hung up the phone. She instantly sent the driver to pick Gu Xiaoxiao up. Then she called Gu Man to humiliate and blame her for a long time.

Lin Lijuan demand Gu Man that she should let Gu Ning apologize to Gu Xiaoxiao, or this would never end.

Gu Man was shocked after hearing what had happened. Gu Ning had hit Gu Xiaoxiao by a plate, and even had slapped her? Gu Man found it was hard to believe, but since Lin Lijuan called her in person, it could be true.

Gu Man, at the same time, assumed it wasn’t as bad as what Lin Lijuan had said. Even though Gu Ning had beaten Gu Xiaoxiao, she must have done it because Gu Xiaoxiao had irritated her.

Gu Man knew Gu Xiaoxiao so well. Gu Xiaoxiao had bullied Gu Ning for countless times ever since she was a little girl.

Though Gu Man knew Gu Ning had been bullied, she didn’t know how to deal with it.

However, what had scared Gu Man more was that Lin Lijuan said Gu Ning had picked up a rich boy, and behaved immorally.

She couldn’t believe Gu Ning would do that, but teenagers were fall in love easily in adolescence. Gu Man was really concerned that Gu Ning would have done something wrong.

The minute Gu Man hung up the call from Lin Lijuan, she called Gu Ning at once.

When Gu Ning received Gu Man’s call, they just arrived at the small forest.

“Ningning, your eldest aunt just called me and said you’ve hit Xiaoxiao by a plate. You even have slapped her? What has happened? Your eldest aunt also said you must apologize to Xiaoxiao, or this won’t end,” Gu Man worriedly inquired.

Hearing this, Gu Ning wasn’t surprised at all. She knew Gu Xiaoxiao would do this.

“I did throw a plate to her, but it didn’t hit her. The plate was simply upside down on her head, and ruined her hair, face and clothes. That’s all. I didn’t beat her neither. She has humiliated me for many times. An upside down plate wasn’t a serious punishment, to be honest,” Gu Ning explained calmly. She didn’t think she had done anything wrong.

“And the apologies, I did nothing wrong, so I won’t apologize.” Gu Ning refused to apologize without hesitation.

Gu Man knew Lin Lijuan had exaggerated the facts. Now hearing Gu Ning’s explanation, Gu Man believed she was right.

Gu Man couldn’t help feeling bad after she found out the reason why Gu Ning had thrown the plate out. She blamed herself for being useless, or her daughter wouldn’t be bullied that often.

A mother would protect her daughter naturally. Although Gu Man still thought Gu Ning have gone too far by throwing the plate, she believed Gu Ning had done nothing wrong. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Thus she didn’t force Gu Ning to apologize.

“Ningning, you’re going to attend the college entrance exam soon. You need to focus on your study, and don’t fall in love at such a young age.” Gu Man intended to ask Gu Ning whether she had picked up a rich boy, but she was afraid Gu Ning would felt hurt, so Gu Man didn’t ask her directly.
