Chapter 469 Enemies Often Cross Each Other’s Path

“Whatever will be, will be,” Gu Ning said. The future was full of changes and plans could never catch up with change, so it was better that they go with the flow.

Although Yu Mixi didn’t know that Mu Ke admired her, she felt a little uneasy and shy when she was alone with him. Mu Ke was handsome and gentle. Yu Mixi would be lying if she said that she had no affection towards him, but she also knew the abyss between them, so she never allowed herself to imagine their future.

On the way, the two barely talked. However, when they arrived, Mu Ke followed Yu Mixi in getting out of the car and walked her to the stairs.

“Thanks,” Yu Mixi said.

“My pleasure. Good night,” Mu Ke said gently.

Yu Mixi’s heart skipped a beat when Mu Ke said goodnight to her, because it was the first time that a boy had said that to her like that.

“Good night,” Yu Mixi replied, before she walked upstairs.

Mu Ke didn’t leave until Yu Mixi’s back disappeared from his sight. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When Gu Ning got home, Gu Man was still awake. Gu Ning knew that her mother was in a bad mood at a glance.

“Mom, what’s wrong?” Gu Ning asked with concern.

Gu Man then told Gu Ning what had happened to Gu Xiaoxiao.

Gu Ning had already heard about it, so she wasn’t surprised. However, to her astonishment, Gu Qinxiang would actually call Gu Man and even wanted the Hao family to help Gu Xiaoxiao out, which was totally insane.

“Just ignore him, and we won’t be involved in this mess. Gu Xiaoxiao deserves it,” Gu Ning said. She didn’t tell Gu Man the details, because they didn’t care.

After a short while, Gu Ning’s phone rang, and the caller was Leng Shaoting. It’s already past 12 am, so Leng Shaoting called her to wish her happy Lantern Festival. Because Gu Man hadn’t gone to bed yet, Gu Ning didn’t talk with Leng Shaoting on the phone for a long time, in case Gu Man would have doubts.

The next day was the Lantern Festival.

The capital, in the Leng family’s old house...

Master Leng got up early that morning, and felt relaxed as well as energetic. He knew that it was the great effects of the pill that Leng Shaoting had given him yesterday, and was quite surprised. Master Leng kept complimenting Gu Ning in front of Leng Shaoting, which made Leng Shaoting feel extremely satisfied. Leng Shaoting wouldn’t be as happy even if his grandpa praised him.

Afterwards, Master Leng called Master Jiang at once. He couldn’t wait to show off in front of his old friend, but he didn’t tell Master Jiang that the pills were from Gu Ning. Instead, he only told Master Jiang that he got a special medicine which was good for his health.

Master Jiang, however, was worried. “Leng, are you sure the pill is safe? It sounds very abnormal!” Master Jiang didn’t want Master Leng to be deceived.

“Of course it’s safe! I’m not dumb!” Master Leng retorted. “I indeed feel relaxed, comfortable and energetic now. I used to feel tired after walking for just a dozen minutes, but I walked for half an hour in my yard this morning and didn’t feel tired at all! In addition, I have a great appetite now!”

“Really?” Master Jiang doubted it, but was also curious. He had never heard of it before, so he didn’t believe it. At the same time, he also knew that there were so many things that he had never heard of. Therefore, he was quite curious.

“Why would I lie to you?” Master Leng said. He was a little mad and disappointed because he simply wanted to show off, but his friend thought that it wasn’t normal. “Fine, forget it.” After that, he hung up.

Master Leng had planned to call Master Xu in the beginning, but he gave up on that now, because his good mood was already ruined by Master Jiang.

Master Leng’s family was also curious about why he suddenly became so energetic with a great appetite, but none of them knew the reason, because Master Leng wouldn’t tell them.

In City F, Gu Ning went to do grocery shopping with Gu Qing and Gu Man in the morning.

They had spent the New Year Festival at Gu Man’s, so they decided to spend the Lantern Festival at Gu Qing’s.

Once they were out, Gu Ning sensed that someone was secretly staring at them, and she instantly knew who it was. Is he still here? He didn’t go home for the Lantern Festival? Gu Ning thought to herself. Suddenly, Gu Ning felt sorry for him. She also had the impulse to invite him to spend the Lantern Festival with them, but it was obviously not the right time.

In Gu Qinxiang’s home, it was the worst Lantern Festival that they had ever had because of what had happened to Gu Xiaoxiao. Gu Qinxiang had turned to a lawyer for advice on Gu Xiaoxiao’s lawsuit early that morning, but the lawyer’s answer was that Gu Xiaoxiao was doomed to be put in jail as long as the Chen family wasn’t willing to settle it out of court. Besides, Gu Xiaoxiao would be sentenced to at least three years in jail according to the injuries she had caused.

Hearing the answer, Gu Qinxiang knew that it was hopeless but he still did his best trying to get a lighter sentence for Gu Xiaoxiao.

Cao Wenxin’s family went to spend the Lantern Festival at her aunt’s today, and they set off right after breakfast.

However, the moment that Cao Wenxin walked inside, she was stunned when she noticed the man sitting on the sofa.

Xin Bei! Why is he here? The man sitting on the sofa was Xin Bei.

Xin Bei said that he was going to visit his uncle, but he appears here. Is it possible... My uncle is his uncle too! Jesus! How is it possible!

Cao Wenxin almost went crazy especially when she thought of what had happened on the plane yesterday. And she really wanted to run away right now.

Xin Bei was also stunned when Cao Wenxin showed up. Unexpectedly, Cao Wenxin was the daughter of his aunt’s younger brother. Thinking of what had happened on the plane yesterday, Xin Bei felt uneasy too, so he directly turned his head away from her, pretending that he didn’t know her.

“Wenjun, Wenxin, come on in! Let me introduce you. This is my cousin, Xin Bei!” A man who was around 30-years-old, standing by Xin Bei’s side said to Cao Wenjun and Cao Wenxin, then turned to Xin Bei. “They’re my cousins too, Cao Wenjun and Cao Wenxin.”

The man who introduced them to each other was named Xin Chen. He was the son of Xin Bei’s uncle as well as the son of Cao Wenjun and Cao Wenxin’s uncle.

“Nice to meet you!”

“Nice to meet you too!”

Xin Bei greeted Cao Wenjun, but ignored Cao Wenxin. Luckily, no one noticed that except for themselves.

“Chen, where is Wei?” Cao Wenxin couldn’t stay there for a second longer, so she could only turn to talking with her cousin’s wife.

“She is upstairs with the child.” Xin Chen said.

“Oh, I’ll go find her,” saying that, Cao Wenxin quickly ran upstairs, like she was escaping away.

Xin Chen and Cao Wenjun felt like Cao Wenxin was different today, but didn’t think further. The men sat down together then, starting to chat.
