Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Master Chang was angry when he heard the news, but the chauffeur said the window suddenly exploded by itself. He didn’t realize it could be done on purpose.

Afterwards, the Chang family rushed to the hospital. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

If they set off right now, Master Chang’s elder son and the chauffeur would already be sent to the hospital, so there was no need for them to go to the accident scene right now. They would just go straight to the hospital.

At the same time, they also sent people to the accident scene to see what exactly had happened.

“Dad, is it really an accident or was it done on purpose?” asked Master Chang’s second son. Although it really seemed to be an accident, he didn’t think it was.

“If the glass exploded, it could be an accident, but it could also be done on purpose. We need to know more details to come to a conclusion,” said Master Chang. He tended to believe it was an accident.

The accident happened right after they schemed against the Leng family, so they might wonder whether the Leng family had found out and took revenge, but Master Chang didn’t think the Leng family could find out so quickly. He also refused to believe the Leng family was able to cause a car accident without leaving any evidence.

No matter what, they needed a further investigation.

Because the accident happened in public and Master Chang’s elder son was involved, the news soon spread abroad. All the major families heard about it.

Master Leng understood it was done by Jing Yunyao and knew that as a cultivator, Jing Yunyao had unbelievable skills, but he was still surprised when he heard that she caused the accident to happen without leaving any evidence.

It was really incredible!

Other members in the Leng family didn’t know it was done by Jing Yunyao, but it happened right after they found out that the Chang family might be guilty. It made them wonder whether it was the Leng family’s idea.

Anyway, Leng Yuanzhen asked Master Leng curiously, “Dad, do you think it’s an accident or was it done on purpose?”

“Who knows! Perhaps they’re being punished by the gods. And the gods taught them a lesson for their bad deeds.” Master Leng didn’t tell them that it was done by Jing Yunyao. After all, there was no evidence left at the scene. If he told them it was done by Jing Yunyao, he would need to explain how she did it.

In order to not expose Jing Yunyao’s secret, he decided not to say anything about it.

Leng Yuanzhen didn’t believe that, but he thought it was an accident.

Other major families also thought it was an accident. Only a few doubted whether it was done on purpose, because they didn’t know about the situation at the accident scene.

The Chang family encountered the accident right after the Leng family got in trouble, so there could be several reasons.

First, the Leng family was in trouble because of the Chang family, so the Leng family paid the Chang family back.

Second, someone schemed against the Leng family, then the Chang family, and tried to stir things up between the two families. The mastermind might turn to scheme against other major families afterwards.

Third, what the Leng family had run into and what the Chang family had encountered were both accidents.

Fourth, the Leng family was schemed against by someone, but what the Chang family had encountered was really an accident.

Anyway, there were a lot of guesses.

…

When the Chang family arrived at the hospital, Master Chang and the chauffeur had already been sent over. Because there were many glass pieces in Master Chang’s elder son’s body, he was pushed into the operation room at once.

The chauffeur’s leg was broken and he had a minor concussion, so a doctor was dealing with his wounds.

The result of the accident wasn’t out yet, so they didn’t know much.

Half an hour later, the chauffeur was out after his wounds were taken care of. Due to the effect of anesthetic, he was still asleep, so Master Chang couldn’t ask any questions.

About twenty minutes later, the police, who had visited the accident scene, came but they still didn’t know any details.

“Master Chang, we watched the surveillance video. The glass exploded by itself. Then the car hit a big truck in the front. We asked the chauffeur just then, and the chauffeur said he was scared by the sudden explosion. He didn’t hold the steering wheel steadily and mistook the accelerator for the brake, which caused the accident. That’s all we know. And we found nothing wrong with the car at the scene. So, we think it’s probably an accident,” said a policeman.

If so, the Chang family accepted that result.

Master Chang’s elder son wasn’t pushed out until one and a half hours had passed, but he was also unconscious under the effect of anesthetic.

The wife of Master Chang’s elder son stayed to take care of him, while the others left.

At this time, it was already 8 pm and the sky was completely dark.

After the Chang family returned to their home, they got out of the car together.

In the darkness, Jing Yunyao summoned up magical energy and hit Master Chang without delay. The next moment, Master Chang suddenly felt a lot of pain and passed out.

“Dad!”

“Grandpa!”

In an instant, the Chang family fell into a mess, but they all believed that Master Chang fainted because of the pressure.

However, they still drove Master Chang to the hospital at once.

After doing that, Jing Yunyao went back to the Leng family’s house.

In the Leng family’s house. Jing Yunyao followed Master Leng to his study for a private talk.

“Dad, don’t worry, no one saw me.” Jing Yunyao comforted Master Leng because she knew he would be worried.

“What happened to Chang?” asked Master Leng.

“It’s not serious. He’ll only be unconscious for a while,” said Jing Yunyao. After all, Master Chang was old, so she should be gentle.

“Great!” Master Leng didn’t stop and even supported Jing Yunyao, but he still didn’t want anyone to be killed.

…

After the Chang family took Master Chang to the hospital, they didn’t find anything wrong with his body, but he just couldn’t wake up. The doctor could only tell them that Master Chang was under too much anxiety and pressure, so he passed out.

If so, the Chang family didn’t need to be worried.

Before long, other major families heard the news that Master Chang fainted, but they all thought he was under a lot of pressure, so no one gloated over it.

…

In Country Y, because of jet lag, it was only 12 am while it was already 8 pm in the capital of Leng Yuanqian’s country.

Therefore, after Gu Ning, Leng Yuanqian and others arrived at the embassy and learned about the general situation, they had lunch first.
