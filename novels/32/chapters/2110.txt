“So I was willing to give you power crystals afterwards. I told you someone else gave them to me because I didn’t want you to focus on me. Well, the power crystals were indeed given to me by someone else,” said Gu Ning.

Even if Baili Zongxue knew that she was a cultivator, Gu Ning still needed to hide her secrets.

Hearing Gu Ning’s words, Baili Zongxue also felt touched and surprised.

It turned out that Gu Ning knew everything from the very beginning, and had no intention of blaming her.

As for the power crystals, Baili Zongxue didn’t doubt Gu Ning’s words and believed that Gu Ning got them from someone else.

“I know that there are many cultivators who are spying on me because of the magical power in the medicines from Colaine, but they don’t have power crystals yet,” said Gu Ning.

Baili Zongxue knew that there were many cultivators who were spying on Gu Ning for the magical power in the medicines from Colaine. Although she couldn’t notice it when she was with Gu Ning, she knew it was true. There were many smart people other than the Baili family. Because her level was low, she just couldn’t sense their existence.

Not every family had a good reputation like the Baili family, so Baili Zongxue suddenly became worried about Gu Ning’s safety.

However, Gu Ning’s level seemed to be average, but she had outstanding abilities.

Baili Zongxue was more sure of the guess in her mind.

“Gu Ning, are you…” Baili Zongxue stammered. She didn’t know how to ask about that. She was afraid that Gu Ning might be unhappy if she knew too much. However, it was torture for her if she couldn’t get the answer.

“Ask me whatever you want to know. I’ll tell you what I can tell. If I can’t, I won’t answer your questions,” said Gu Ning.

Since Gu Ning said that, Baili Zongxue asked her without hesitation, “Gu Ning, I have a guess. Are you Shangguan Yang’s disciple, Qing He?”

Hearing that, Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second. She didn’t expect Baili Zongxue to find out.

Anyway, since Baili Zongxue asked her that question, Baili Zongxue must have held the doubt for a long time.

“Why do you think I’m Qing He?” Gu Ning asked instead, but she also admitted she was Qing He in that way.

Baili Zongxue had already found out, so Gu Ning didn’t bother to fool her again by denying it. Besides, Baili Zongxue already had doubts. Even if she denied it, Baili Zongxue might not be convinced.

Although Baili Zongxue guessed that Gu Ning was Qing He, she was still amazed when she received Gu Ning’s silent affirmation. She only had that doubt, but she wasn’t totally sure of it. Actually, if Gu Ning denied it, she wouldn’t be convinced.

Since Gu Ning was Qing He, Gu Ning must be Shangguan Yang’s disciple. Knowing that, Baili Zongxue got excited.

In that case, Gu Ning’s abilities must be better than her level. Even though other cultivators wanted to hurt Gu Ning, it wouldn’t be easy. Moreover, Gu Ning had the help of her master and senior male apprentice.

After calming down for a while, Baili Zongxue said, “Although you have two different faces and I can’t see any hints of Gu Ning from Qing He, it should be easy for you to change your appearance since you’re Senior Shangguan’s disciple. When Qing He rescued me the second time, I felt she was familiar, but I couldn’t remember her face at all. I was wondering whether we’d met before when we were kids, but I changed my mind. I had that doubt because you have the same level as Qing He, but you’re able to release strong magical power, and you aren’t a member of the cultivation world. Anyway, I only had that doubt, and I wasn’t sure of it…”

“Yeah, I’m Qing He, but I hope you can keep it a secret. Don’t tell other people, including your older brother. I’ll let him know when it’s necessary,” said Gu Ning.

“Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone,” said Baili Zongxue seriously. This time, she didn’t feel guilty just because she needed to keep it a secret from Baili Zongyang.

Actually, after talking with Gu Ning, Baili Zongxue relaxed and didn’t need to worry that there might be estrangement between them.

Right after they finished their talk, Song Miaoge and Zhang Zikai were back. They had a walk for another while, then went back to their own classes.

…

After the evening class, Shi Xiaoyue hurriedly left the classroom to see Jin Jingshan. She needed to know whether they had a chance to pay Jin Jingshan back.

Chu Peihan followed slightly farther behind. If there was a chance, she would show up.

Chu Peihan was very lucky. After Jin Jingshan left the classroom, she didn’t go back to the dormitory, but went to the football field.

Seeing that, Shi Xiaoyue sent a message to Chu Peihan at once and Chu Peihan walked to the football field too.

The light on the football field was very dark and there were no surveillance cameras. Even if there were surveillance cameras, it was too dark to take clear pictures. Therefore, the football field became a good place for students to date, and it was also a good place for Chu Peihan to carry out her plan.

She would quickly run away after beating Jin Jingshan, and no one would know who did it.

Chu Peihan didn’t want other people to know it was done by her, but she had no intention of keeping it secret from Jin Jingshan. On the contrary, she wanted Jin Jingshan to know it was done by her. She wanted to teach Jin Jingshan that she wasn’t easy to bully.

Jin Jingshan walked to the small woods after she reached the football field.

The small woods were a better place for Chu Peihan to carry out her plan.

Obviously, Jin Jingshan came here to date after the evening class was over and she didn’t go back to dormitory.

As soon as Jin Jingshan walked into the small woods, Chu Peihan followed her. When Jin Jingshan was alone without anyone around, Chu Peihan seized the chance.

Without delay, she ran ahead and punched Jin Jingshan.

As Chu Peihan punched Jin Jingshan, she said, “Jin Jingshan, I didn’t offend you, but you hired a bunch of people to hurt me. This is what I’m doing to pay you back. Now, enjoy!”

Chu Peihan wouldn’t seriously hurt Jin Jingshan, but she didn’t hesitate to vent her anger on Jin Jingshan. Jin Jingshan shouted in pain the entire time.

She heard Chu Peihan’s words, so she knew that it was Chu Peihan. She was shocked that Chu Peihan knew it was she who hired those men. It couldn’t be more obvious that those men had failed and betrayed her.

Knowing that, Jin Jingshan was full of anger. She was so disappointed in those men. However, she couldn’t think much about that right now. She could only hope that someone would come to help her out.
