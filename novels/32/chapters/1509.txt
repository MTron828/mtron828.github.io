Chapter 1510: I Will Settle Your Debts

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Hearing her daughter call Gu Ning Goddess Gu, Mrs. Zhao was confused. It was obvious that her daughter was familiar with Gu Ning, but she didn’t know why. However, she didn’t think that Gu Ning, who was merely a young girl in her eyes, would be able to rescue her husband.

And it was not only Mrs. Zhao, other people didn’t believe it either.

“Is this girl crazy? How could she beg another young girl to rescue her father?”

“She’s just a young girl, and she can do nothing about it.”

“She must be too worried and doesn’t know what to do now.”

“I agree.”

“...”

Anyway, no one believed that Gu Ning could settle it, but Gu Ning didn’t care about their opinions.

“Don’t worry, I’m sure that your father will be fine,” Gu Ning said with confidence.

Zhao Jinghan heavily nodded and felt comforted after hearing that.

Mrs. Zhao, on the other hand, only felt touched, and didn’t take Gu Ning’s promise seriously. At least Gu Ning wasn’t as annoying as those onlookers.

The next second, Gu Ning took off her backpack (her telepathic eye space) and got a loudspeaker out of it.

Everyone was surprised when she took it out.

Gu Ning turned it on and shouted to Zhao Binxu, “Hey, Mr. Zhao, do you think you can solve the problem by committing suicide? Have you even thought about your wife and daughter? Since you’re not afraid of death, do you dare sell yourself to me? I can pay off your debts and punish the person who deceived you, but you must work for me.”

Hearing that, the onlookers were shocked.

“What? Is she crazy?”

“I can’t believe my ears.”

“She can settle his debts? Seriously?”

“She’s bragging.”

“I think she simply wants to get the man down the balcony.”

“No idea.”

“I don’t believe it.”

“...”

Most of the onlookers thought that Gu Ning was making an excuse to get Zhao Binxu down the building. If it was true, Gu Ning’s behavior was understandable in their eyes.

Zhao Jinghan, on the other hand, got excited and was full of hope at this moment. She knew that Gu Ning could do that, because she was one of her fans.

Mrs. Zhao was also greatly surprised, and wasn’t sure whether Gu Ning was serious or not. Anyway, as long as her husband could be rescued, she was willing to believe Gu Ning this time.

Zhao Binxu calmed down a little when he heard Gu Ning’s promise, and he had a feeling that she wasn’t joking.

“Do you mean it?” he asked. In fact, he was reluctant to die, but he had no choice now. He simply wanted his friend to return his money. If his friend refused to do that, he might really jump from the top floor of this building.

Although he owned a company and made some money these years, he wasn’t very rich. Because he wasn’t very rich, he didn’t have much influence in business and politics, and no one could support him after he was deceived.

He only wanted his money back and hoped that his friend could be punished according to the law. Unfortunately, he felt helpless when he lost everything he used to own.

“Of course I mean it. Do you have your phone with you? You can search my name on the Internet. My name’s Gu Ning. You’ll know whether I have the ability to help you out after reading some news about me.”

“If you trust me, you can come down right now and we can have a talk about your difficulties. I know who you are, and I also know you’re excellent at running a business. I need people like you to work for me,” Gu Ning said to him.

Zhao Binxu was sitting at the edge of the top floor, and would be fine as long as he didn’t move around, so he could use his phone.

Onlookers got curious about Gu Ning as well, so they all began to search for information about Gu Ning.

Gu Ning actually didn’t want to expose her identity in public, but she didn’t have a better idea now. She needed to convince Zhao Binxu to give up committing suicide, so she had to show him her ability.

After reading news about Gu Ning on the Internet, everyone was shocked.

“Wow, she’s the top scorer of the National College Entrance Examination this year!”

“Oh, I know her.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“She’s so unbelievable.”

“Now I believe that she’s able to settle his debts.”

“Wow, she’s the famous Goddess Gu!”

“I didn’t recognize her.”

“...”

Everyone believed that Gu Ning wasn’t bragging now, and they all admired her after knowing about her incredible achievements.

Mrs. Zhao heard their discussion, and learned a lot about Gu Ning too. All of a sudden, she realized that her daughter had turned to the right person for help. No one could deal with it better than Gu Ning in the current situation.

Thinking of that, Mrs. Zhao begged Gu Ning as well. “Miss Gu, as long as you can rescue my husband, I’m willing to do anything for you.”
