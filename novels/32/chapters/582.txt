Chapter 583 Yu Zi Fights Back

Right at this moment, Yu Zi’s phone vibrated in her pocket. She took it out and saw a new message sent by Gu Ning.

Gu Ning: Show them a proud back. I’m sitting in a white Lamborghini at the roadside. Get in.

After reading the message, Yu Zi immediately looked at the roadside, and there was indeed a white Lamborghini. She was astonished that her boss was that rich. Afterwards, Yu Zi did what Gu Ning told her in the message. She looked at them with her back straightened up and said with pride, “Sorry, I gotta go now.” Then she turned around without hesitation, walking to the roadside. Right before their eyes, she got in the Lamborghini which was worth over ten million yuan.

Lin Tianyou and Zhao Xiaoxuan were totally shocked.

“Since when did Yu Zi get to know someone who’s that rich?” Zhao Xiaoxuan couldn’t believe her eyes and said with strong jealousy. Although she wasn’t familiar with cars the white Lamborghini was obviously a luxurious car. Yu Zi was merely a poor girl, so how could she get to know someone who was that rich?

“She must have found herself a sugar-daddy. I thought that she is an independent girl, but it turns out that she’s a gold digger!” Zhao Xiaoxuan said in a malicious tone even though she actually felt quite jealous of Yu Zi because she really wanted to have a super-rich boyfriend.

Without a doubt, Zhao Xiaoxuan was really a girl without moral standards, because she not only stole her good friend’s boyfriend, but wouldn’t hesitate to sell her body for money either.

Lin Tianyou was also displeased. Yu Zi was his ex-girlfriend, but he was still annoyed that Yu Zi whom he had despised now had a boyfriend who was much richer than him. Zhao Xiaoxuan wasn’t familiar with cars, but he was, and he knew at first glance that the Lamborghini was a limited edition which cost at least ten million yuan.

Ten million yuan was half of his family’s wealth. Let alone a Lamborghini, he couldn’t afford a car which cost over a million yuan, and the car he was driving now was only worth four hundred thousand yuan. What Yu Zi just did was like a slap across his face.

Seeing Lin Tianyou and Zhao Xiaoxuan being shocked, Yu Zi felt satisfied. She didn’t care what they thought of her.

“Do you have a car?” Gu Ning asked Yu Zi. “Not yet,” Yu Zi replied. “Do you have a driver’s license?” Gu Ning asked.

“Yes, but I seldom drive, so I’m not a good driver,” Yu Zi said.

“Each of the senior management in my company can have a car under my name. You can go to choose a car that you like which costs less than a million yuan when you’re free, and I’ll buy it for you,” Gu Ning said.

As long as Yu Zi worked in Gu Ning’s company as a member of the senior management, she could have an exclusive car. However, once she left the company or was demoted, she would lose the right to use the car.

Of course, Yu Zi wouldn’t be willing to leave the company, and she was determined to work hard for her future. In that case, the car belonged to her to some extent.

“Thanks,” Yu Zi said.

Although the garment factory had temporarily stopped working, security guards were still on duty. Gu Ning came here today with Yu Zi to look around it to see whether there was something that needed changing or replacing

After walking around it, Yu Zi decided to set the production line of Charm on the third floor, and she made a note of the equipment and goods she needed. The company was newly-established and shorthanded, so she had to do it herself. When she got the money, she would arrange purchasing agents to buy the equipment and goods.

When they walked out of the garment factory, it was already 11:30 am, so they went to have lunch together.

On the way, Yu Zi received a call from a stranger. She didn’t know that the person was Lin Tianyou, so she picked it up.

“Hi, who’s this?” Yu Zi asked.

“Yu Zi, how could you find yourself a sugar-daddy? I know that I’ve broken your heart, and you want to annoy me by finding yourself a rich man, but...” Lin Tianyou believed that Yu Zi must have found herself a sugar-daddy to annoy him.

“Lin Tianyou, who do you think you are? How could you be so shameless to say that I did it just to annoy you?” Yu Zi was so mad that she interrupted him before hanging up on him.

Yu Zi was mad not because Lin Tianyou slandered her but because Lin Tianyou was so self-centered, which was totally unacceptable in her eyes.

When Lin Tianyou called her again, Yu Zi refused to answer it.

“I’m sorry,” Yu Zi apologized to Gu Ning when she realized that she had just shouted right beside Gu Ning. Although Gu Ning was very kind, she had to be respectful.

“It’s fine. The best way to beat your enemy is to live a better life. I believe that you can do it,” Gu Ning said to comfort her.

“Thanks, I will,” Yu Zi said with determination. She knew that not everyone could be so lucky to get such a good chance like her, so she was determined to seize this opportunity to fight for her future and wouldn’t let Gu Ning down. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“What do you want to eat?” Gu Ning asked.

“You can make the decision.” Yu Zi wasn’t the boss after all.

“Do you have any food allergies?” Gu Ning asked again.

“Nope,” Yu Zi said.

Gu Ning thought for a while then said, “Let’s go dine in the restaurant next to Fengshang Shopping Mall.”

“Good idea!” Yu Zi agreed.

Gu Ning parked the car in the parking lot, and then they got out together. When they walked into the restaurant, they chose a table beside the window.

“Everyone knows that Lord Tang never married or had a child in City B, but a mother and daughter suddenly appeared in the Tang family’s house a few days ago. The girl closely resembles Lord Tang!” a man said to another man at a nearby table.

Hearing that, Gu Ning frowned and looked over at them. Didn’t grandpa warn the domestic servants not to leak the news? How could they know that? Is this a part of Tang Deming’s scheme too?

Only the Tang family and Tang Deming were aware of the fact that Gu Ning was Tang Yunfan’s biological daughter. If nobody in the Tang family leaked the information, Tang Deming must have done it.

However, in the meantime, two women who were over 30 years old were obviously surprised when they heard the two men’s discussion. One of the two women wore a displeased face. Unfortunately, Gu Ning didn’t notice that.

“Do you mean that the girl could be Lord Tang’s daughter?” the other man asked.
