Chapter 1614: Lose Control

Another man handed both Gu Ning and Gu Anna a cup of drink, but Gu Ning refused. “Sorry, I don’t drink.” Gu Ning was reluctant to drink with them after hearing their conversation earlier. Their target was Gu Anna, but Gu Anna was her friend, so she was mad at them.

Once Gu Ning refused to drink, the man looked displeased. “Just drink a little. It’ll be boring if you don’t drink at all.”

“Feng Zi, my friend doesn’t drink so you shouldn’t force her to drink. I can drink with you,” said Gu Anna. She thought that she should protect Gu Ning.

“Anna, it’s just a drink. It isn’t a big deal,” said Gu Anna’s female friend A.

“Right, we drink for fun, so don’t be a wet blanket!” Her female friend B joined their persuasion.

“Well, I can drink on behalf of my friend, alright?” said Gu Anna. She wasn’t dumb, and she could see that her two female friends were aiming to hurt Gu Ning. Gu Ning was much prettier than them, and they were simply jealous of Gu Ning.

“No, you can’t. It’ll be boring if you drink alone,” said Gu Anna’s male friend A.

“Fine, I can drink with you.” Since they wouldn’t give up persuading her to drink, Gu Ning agreed, but she wouldn’t let them do whatever they wanted. “If we want to drink for fun, no one should quit halfway till we’re all satisfied. To be honest with you, I may lose control of myself if I’m not satisfied after drinking.”

Gu Ning intended to teach them a lesson. She had magical power to protect herself, so she wouldn’t feel uncomfortable no matter how much she drank.

The other people in the room didn’t think Gu Ning was able to drink much, so they thought it was very easy.

“No problem, but this drink is quite strong, so you should be careful,” said Gu Anna’s male friend B.

“Ningning.” Gu Anna was a little worried about Gu Ning.

“Relax, it’s fine,” Gu Ning said to comfort Gu Anna.

Since Gu Ning said that, Gu Anna closed her mouth. She believed that Gu Ning was a smart girl.

“Miss Gu, don’t get above yourself, or you’ll be embarrassed,” said Gu Anna’s female friend A.

“If you want to challenge me, why don’t we have a cup first?” Gu Ning said.

“I’m in!” The woman accepted Gu Ning’s challenge and drank a cup of alcohol without hesitation.

Gu Ning also had a cup, then began to drink with other people. In the following minutes, she didn’t give them any time to rest and kept on drinking with them diligently.

Gu Anna wanted to stop Gu Ning, but Gu Ning wouldn’t listen to her. Gu Anna’s friends also told her not to interrupt them. They got excited because of Gu Ning’s aggressive and arrogant attitude, and they were determined to defeat Gu Ning.

Gu Anna had to sit aside and watch them drink. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

At the beginning, everyone believed that Gu Ning would be drunk soon, but Gu Ning stayed clear-headed the entire time. On the contrary, they started to get drunk.

“Oh, my head is spinning. I can’t drink more,” said Gu Anna’s female friend B. She still wanted to keep a good image in front of the others.

“What? No way! Do you want to quit halfway?” Gu Ning pretended to be displeased.

“I...” The woman was struck dumb for a second, then summoned up her determination. “Fine, let’s drink!”

Afterwards, Gu Ning and the woman had a cup of alcohol together. They kept on drinking and no one dared to quit halfway.

When Gu Anna found that Gu Ning was still clear-headed after drinking a lot, she stopped worrying about her.

The two women had tried to withdraw, but Gu Anna and Gu Ning wouldn’t allow them to leave. Gu Anna sided with Gu Ning today, and was also determined to teach them a lesson.

“Miss Gu, you’re really good at drinking, but I think it’s enough for today,” said Gu Anna’s male friend A.

“I told you no one should quit halfway; I’ll lose my temper if I’m not satisfied once we start drinking,” said Gu Ning.

“You...” The man was a little mad, but he couldn’t blame Gu Ning for it.

“What? Do you regret challenging Ningning now? You can’t leave today until Ningning is satisfied,” said Gu Anna. She had a higher social status than her friends, so they didn’t dare to annoy her.
