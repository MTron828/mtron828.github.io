Chapter 1047 Can We Have a Round for Fun?

Even if the traffic police officer was unwilling to do Leng Shaoxun a favor, he was left no choice.

Leng Shaoxun could easily make his leader order him to do what Leng Shaoxun wanted.

When the traffic police officer walked aside with Leng Shaoxun, Jiang Ruining thanked Gu Ning with sincerity. “Nice to see you, miss. My name is Jiang Ruining, and thank you so much for saving our lives. May I know your name?”

“You’re welcome, and we’re simply strangers. There is no need for you to know my name,” Gu Ning said.

“Is it an anonymous favor?” Jiang Ruining was amused. Gu Ning smiled, but said nothing.

Not far away from them, Leng Shaoxun directly showed the traffic police officer his ID card. “My family is the dominant Leng family in the capital. I understand that what the girl just did isn’t appropriate, but she did it to save my life, so please let her go.”

Leng Shaoxun’s ID card proved everything.

The second the traffic police officer saw his ID card, he was shocked. He didn’t expect that he could meet an important member of the Leng family today. Since Leng Shaoxun was involved in this, he didn’t dare to turn him down.

“Well, of course,” the traffic police officer said at once.

Although Leng Shaoxun was only about 20, while the traffic police officer was over 30, he still felt nervous standing in front of Leng Shaoxun.

“Thanks,” Leng Shaoxun said. He was unwilling to force this traffic police officer to do him a favor, but it was different this time. Gu Ning was his life-saver after all.

“My pleasure, Lord Leng,” the traffic police officer said with respect.

After that, the traffic police left, and onlookers immediately realized that Leng Shaoxun wasn’t a common citizen.

Anyway, Gu Ning just saved their lives, so it was understandable that she wouldn’t be punished. She didn’t cause any damage either.

“Miss, thank you so much for saving our lives. My name is Leng Shaoxun. May I know your name?” Leng Shaoxun asked Gu Ning.

“My name’s Gu Ning,” Gu Ning said.

She heard Leng Shaoxun’s talk with the traffic police officer, and she was surprised to find that he was Leng Shaoting’s younger cousin. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Gu Ning also knew that Leng Shaoxun was Leng Yuanzhen’s son. Although Leng Shaoting wasn’t close to him, they got along well. In addition, Leng Shaoxun was the only younger cousin that Leng Shaoting was willing to admit was family. Therefore, Gu Ning didn’t regard him as a stranger. They were about to have a formal meeting too.

Jiang Ruining, however, felt a little displeased, because Gu Ning refused to tell him her name. Was it because Leng Shaoxun was more handsome than him?

Leng Shaoxun felt that Gu Ning’s name sounded familiar, but couldn’t remember who she was. As a result, he didn’t know who Gu Ning was.

“Miss Gu, would you mind sharing afternoon tea with us?” Leng Shaoxun said.

Leng Shaoxun invited her to do that because he really admired Gu Ning’s unbelievable courage and strength. He wanted to know more about her.

Leng Shaoxun was a kung fu lover, and he begged Leng Shaoting to have a round of kung fu competition with him every time Leng Shaoting came home.

Seeing Leng Shaoxun’s expression of anticipation, Gu Ning agreed, thinking that she had nothing else to deal with right now. “Sure.”

Leng Shaoxun was thrilled when Gu Ning agreed. He said, “Why don’t we go to the Tangyun Teahouse?”

Gu Ning had heard of the Tangyun Teahouse. It was a famous high-end teahouse with a relaxed atmosphere.

They got in their own cars, and left for the Tangyun Teahouse.

When they were in the car, Jiang Ruining suddenly remembered something and asked Leng Shaoxun, “Shaoxun, shouldn’t we wait for your Cousin Zhaolin?”

“Nope, call him and tell him to take a taxi home by himself,” Leng Shaoxun said.

Jiang Ruining wore a resigned look, then called Leng Shaoxun’s older cousin, Yu Zhaolin.

Yu Zhaolin hadn’t finished the thing he was dealing with yet when he received Jiang Ruining’s call, and he had no idea what had happened outside just then.

Before long, they arrived at the Tangyun Teahouse.

Tangyun Teahouse was very large and consisted of two buildings of two different styles along with a big garden.

Leng Shaoxun didn’t book a private room, but chose to enjoy the tea at a gazebo so that they could see the beautiful view and breathe fresh air.

After ordering tea, Leng Shaoxun said, “Miss Gu, may I directly call you Gu Ning?”

“Sure,” Gu Ning said.

“Gu Ning, have you practiced kung fu for a long time? How did you manage to push such a heavy car?” Leng Shaoxun asked with curiosity and admiration.

“Yeah, I’ve practiced kung fu for a long time,” Gu Ning said.

“Can we have a round for fun?” Leng Shaoxun asked.

It was his real aim, and he couldn’t wait for it.

“No problem,” Gu Ning said.

They just had a round for fun, because Leng Shaoxun was barely comparable to Gu Ning as to martial arts skills. In fact, if Leng Shaoxun was better than Gu Ning, he wouldn’t have been amazed by what she had done. Even Xu Jinchen, who wasn’t a match for Gu Ning, was able to push a car.

Therefore, Leng Shaoxun was inferior to Xu Jinchen.
