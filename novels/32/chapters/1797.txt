Chapter 1798: Do You Have a Grudge Against Gu Ning?

Because most people paid attention to gossip in the entertainment industry and Fenghua Entertainment had been one of the hottest topics on Weibo many times before, many students had heard of it.

Some people only cared about the company instead of its owner, so not everyone was aware that Gu Ning was the boss of Fenghua Entertainment.

As for Kouzi, many female students were using it and they were all impressed by its unbelievable effects.

Most families also had a habit of preparing Colaine products in their homes, because they were more effective than any other medicines.

Although many people had heard of Gu Ning’s other companies, they knew very little about them, because they were students. They didn’t have many chances to own jewelry, gowns, or antiques.

The several students around Gu Ning only knew she was the top scorer with a full score this year, but they didn’t know she was also the boss of so many famous companies. Therefore, they were all shocked now. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Well, actually there are more than just that. Go search for more information about Gu Ning on the Internet, and you’ll be surely amazed.” A student who knew more about Gu Ning introduced her to other people.

Hearing that, many students forgot that they were still at a meeting and took out their phones to search for more information about Gu Ning.

Gu Ning put on a resigned look after the dean made her the center of people’s attention. She could only pray that the dean wouldn’t tell her to stand up, or she would really become a monkey in the zoo and be surrounded and watched by everyone.

The dean knew it would cause Gu Ning unnecessary trouble, so he didn’t tell her to stand up. At the same time, he criticized the students who took out their phone to search for more information about Gu Ning at the meeting.

He did that not only for Gu Ning, but because they were at a meeting now. Students weren’t allowed to play with their phones at a meeting.

Seeing that, Gu Ning felt relieved.

Afterwards, the dean talked about the military training, which would last for 15 days and begin from 8 am tomorrow.

The dean told them to have a class meeting at their own classes at 11 am later, then left.

The dean finished the meeting within an hour, so it was only 10 am after he left. It was still an hour away from the class meeting.

In order to avoid more trouble, Gu Ning quickly slid out of the multimedia classroom, so those who recognized her failed to talk to her.

As a result, someone was displeased.

“Why did she have to walk away so fast? Who does she think she is? Just a rich top scorer!” a female student said with dissatisfaction.

“Do you have a grudge against Gu Ning?” a male student asked her.

“No, why?” replied the female student with impatience.

“Since there is no grudge between you two, why do you badmouth her behind her back? The meeting is already over. She can of course leave as fast as she wants. By the way, she’s indeed somebody. Do you think you’re comparable to her?” The male student defended Gu Ning.

“You...” The female student was mad and snapped at him, “It’s none of your business!”

“If you dislike being judged by others, you should learn not to do it first. You were accepted by the Capital University. Don’t you know such a simple theory?” said the male student. It was indeed none of his business, but he had a strong sense of justice.

Several students around them understood what had happened, so they looked at the female student with disdain.

The female student felt embarrassed, but she knew it was her fault and didn’t know how to retort, so she quietly left.

“Do any one of you know Gu Ning? I didn’t see her at all,” asked someone all of a sudden.

“Me either!”

“She’s already gone. If you want to know what she looks like, you can search for her photos on the Internet. Then you can recognize her in the future when you see her again.”

Many students nodded and began to search for more information about Gu Ning on the Internet.

After that, they began to talk about her again.

By now, everyone knew Gu Ning in the Department of Economics and 80% of the students admired her or took her as their idol. As for the rest, they were jealous of her and hated her.

“Oh, that beautiful girl who wasn’t far away from me just now is Gu Ning! I didn’t know that.”

A student got excited in an instant after seeing Gu Ning’s photos.

“Does anyone know which class Gu Ning is in?”

“I think it’s Class A.”

“Great! I’m in the same class as Gu Ning. I’ll be able to see her in a while.”

“...”

Gu Ning left the multimedia classroom and went to have a walk around the campus. Because the class meeting would begin at 11 am, she didn’t go far.

She found a cool place, then took out her phone to read news.

In a few minutes, she read news about Yu Zi. Yu Zi had won two design awards in a row and she was also the apprentice of a fashion designer from Paris, Jason, so she became well-known in the fashion industry within a very short time.

Moreover, in interviews, Yu Zi also kept promoting Charm, so now Charm was also famous in the fashion industry.

Gu Ning couldn’t help but smile. She felt happy for Yu Zi and herself, because she had chosen the right person.

When it was almost 11 am, Gu Ning left for the class meeting.

As she came to the class, there were already many students inside. So her appearance caused a sensation among the crowd.

All of them had searched for more information about Gu Ning on the Internet after the meeting of their department, so most of them remembered Gu Ning’s face.

Most importantly, Gu Ning was extraordinarily beautiful, so it was very easy for others to remember her.

“Hi, nice to see you all!” Seeing that everyone was staring at her, Gu Ning greeted them of her own accord. She was very nice and gentle, and didn’t look arrogant at all.

“Nice to see you, Goddess Gu!”

“Hi, Gu Ning.”

“Hi, Goddess Gu.”

When Gu Ning greeted them of her own accord, many people felt flattered and greeted Gu Ning at once.

Although many of them were born in a richer family than Gu Ning, it wouldn’t stop them from admiring her, because Gu Ning relied on herself to become so successful, while they mainly relied on their families.

Accordingly, they didn’t think they were better than Gu Ning.

In Class A, not many people held hatred towards Gu Ning. And those who disliked her wouldn’t deliberately cause her trouble. Instead, they were simply jealous of her.

No one liked sitting in the first row, so almost every seat was occupied from the second row. There were only a few vacant seats, but Gu Ning didn’t care much about that, so she directly went to sit down in the first row after knowing that nobody was willing to sit there.

The next second, a group of students kept asking Gu Ning all kinds of questions.
