Chapter 48: Chu Peihan Joins

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Xiaoxiao was so eager to say she had done nothing wrong, but she changed her mind. “I did say something terrible.”

Hearing that, Wang Chengqi immediately understood. “Then go back home and use ice blocks to cover your face. You’ll recover soon.”

Then, Gu Xiaoxiao left.

But after a second, Gu Xiaoxiao called her mother Lin Lijuan and complained. She told Lin Lijuan that Gu Ning had just slapped her three times.

She didn’t say why Gu Ning had slapped her of course. No matter why Gu Ning had slapped her, Lin Lijuan would always blame Gu Ning.

“The bloody bitch. Bastard! How dare she slap my lovely daughter! Sweetie, you come back home now. I’ll never let her get away with it,” Lin Lijuan said in great anger.

The minute Lin Lijuan hung up, she called Gu Man.

Gu Man was asleep at that time. The ringtone woke her up.

Gu Man took a look at the phone. The caller was Lin Lijuan. She didn’t want to answer it because she knew Lin Lijuan wasn’t a kind person.

However, the phone continued to ring. Gu Man had to answer it at the end.

“What?” Gu Man asked coldly.

“Gu Man, your daughter slapped Xiaoxiao this morning. If you don’t bring Gu Ning to apologize to Xiaoxiao, I’ll make you both pay for it!” Lin Lijuan shouted.

Gu Man was a little surprised at first, then immediately realized what had happened. She didn’t blame Gu Ning at all, but questioned Lin Lijuan, “Do you know why Ningning has slapped Xiaoxiao? Do you think Ningning must be bullied and stay quiet, while Xiaoxiao is superior to my daughter?”

Lin Lijuan didn’t feel guilty at all. She said with arrogance, “Of course. Gu Ning can’t compare with Xiaoxiao. Xiaoxiao is our dear daughter, while Gu Ning is merely a bastard.”

“Lin Lijuan!” Gu Man’s face turned red in anger. She shouted, “Stop calling Ningning a bastard. She is my daughter!”

“So what? She doesn’t have a father anyway. She’s a bastard,” Lin Lijuan continued.

“You...” Gu Man was deeply hurt, but couldn’t argue back. She hung up, and burst into tears.

Ningning had a father. They hadn’t been abandoned. Ningning’s father had only passed away.

Lin Lijuan was hung up on by Gu Man. She was so annoyed that she almost smashed her phone. After a while, she called again because she wasn’t done yet.

However, Gu Man wouldn’t answer the call. Lin Lijuan even used Gu Man’s mother’s phone to call her. Gu Man wouldn’t answer either.

Both Lin Lijuan and Gu Man’s mother were in a rage now.

“How dare they do that! Are they going to leave the Gu Family? Do they think they can survive without us?” Gu Man’s mother snapped.

If Gu Man and Gu Ning had heard their talk, they would laugh out in anger.

For the past dozens of years, the Gu Family had never helped them. Gu Man and Gu Ning had always depended on themselves.

And the old house was left by Gu Man’s father. Besides, Gu Man paid the rent.

...

Qin Zheng texted Gu Xiaoxiao because she didn’t come to classes. He then found out that Gu Ning had slapped Gu Xiaoxiao, and Gu Xiaoxiao went back home afterwards.

Knowing Gu Ning had slapped Gu Xiaoxiao, Qin Zheng was mad at Gu Ning.

But he wasn’t as angry as he thought he would be.

He didn’t know why.

In the fourth classroom, Shao Feifei stared at Gu Ning unkindly as usual, and Gu Ning still ignored her.

After the morning class, Chu Peihan walked into the fourth classroom in anger towards Gu Ning.

Everyone believed Chu Peihan was here to pick on Gu Ning. Some felt worried for Gu Ning while some were waiting to see a drama.

Basically only Shao Feifei and her friends couldn’t wait to see the drama.

However, Gu Ning glanced at Chu Peihan calmly. She didn’t believe Chu Peihan was going to cause her any trouble.

Chu Peihan went to Gu Ning, standing and staring at her from a higher position. She looked mad. “Congratulations, Gu Ning! I had just left the school for two days, and you suddenly become the center. Now no one cares about me as the most powerful girl in the school.”

Gu Ning leaned backwards slightly. Her arms crossed before her chest. She looked at ease, then asked airily, “So?”

So?

Everyone thought there would be a fight.

However, they were terribly wrong.

“So, I must join you! I call you boss, and you teach me how to fight. Of course, if you need my support, feel free to let me know,” Chu Peihan said with great sincerity.

Everyone was shocked. They were not going to fight? How was it possible? Why did they suddenly become a group?

It was totally unacceptable to Shao Feifei and her friends.

Why was Gu Ning so lucky to have all those students who were from powerful families, be her friends?

“Ok.” Gu Ning didn’t reject.

It was exactly what Chu Peihan had hoped. She was excited now.

Chu Peihan used a pen on Gu Ning’s desk to write down numbers on her notebook. “This is my phone number. Text me.”

Then, she turned around and left.

When Gu Xiaoxiao got home, her grandmother and mother saw her red, swollen cheeks, and both of them hated Gu Ning to death.

...

At a break between classes, the head teacher asked Gu Ning about her mother’s health.

Gu Ning didn’t hide the truth. She just didn’t tell her teacher the reason why her mother fell down.

The moment that morning classes were over Gu Ning left her school taking a taxi to the old house.

She packed up some important stuff, throwing some abandoned stuff into the trash bin, then left.

Gu Ning went to a delivery company first. She addressed the key to her grandmother before she went to the hospital.

When she arrived at the hospital, it was already 1:40 pm. It was 50 minutes away from the afternoon classes. Gu Ning didn’t have much time. She left after she had a small talk with her mother.

She would wait till the evening class was over, then talk with her mother.

It was already Thursday. Gu Ning planned to go to City G the next afternoon. She had booked a plane ticket and hotel on the Internet yesterday.

She would fly to City G at 7:30 pm tomorrow, and arrive there around 8:30 pm.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
