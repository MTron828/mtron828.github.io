Chapter 2049: I Don’t Care How You Think of Me

He actually didn’t know whether Chu Peihan’s family was rich, but he could see that she wasn’t born in a common family.

Hearing his words, Yang Ziyi and the other girls were surprised. They definitely wouldn’t doubt his words. Since he said that, it meant the person wasn’t Chu Peihan’s sugar-daddy, but a friend.

In addition, Han Chenglin said that she had her own car, which meant that her family couldn’t be poor.

What was worse, given Han Chenglin’s tone, it was obvious that he was familiar with Chu Peihan.

Unexpectedly, Chu Peihan knew Han Chenglin and they were very familiar.

They knew a lot about Han Chenglin. He wasn’t only outstanding, his family was also very rich. In that case, people who were familiar with Han Chenglin couldn’t be poor!

“I don’t go out often. Why do I have to drive a car? Leave it covered by dirt in the parking lot? My friend doesn’t mind sending me back. Why should I feel embarrassed?” said Chu Peihan. She knew that Han Chenglin was helping her, so she accepted his kindness because she was unwilling to get in trouble.

“What? Don’t you need to apologize after slandering me?” Chu Peihan turned to ask Yang Ziyi and the other girls seriously.

She had no intention of paying them back. As long as they apologized, she would let them go.

“S-Sorry.” Yang Ziyi and the other girls subconsciously apologized and didn’t dare to say anything else again.

“Alright, you can go now. If I learn you’re bad-mouthing me again behind my back, you’ll be punished.” Chu Peihan chased them away without patience. She also warned them in the end.

“I-I won’t,” said Yang Ziyi at once. They didn’t dare to pay more attention to the handsome Han Chenglin because they were greatly embarrassed in front of him this time.

After that, they immediately ran away.

Without delay, Chu Peihan turned around, and walked away, leaving Han Chenglin behind.

Seeing that, Han Chenglin was struck dumb for a second. He was surprised by Chu Peihan’s attitude, so he became mad in an instant. “Hey, I helped you out. Shouldn’t you thank me for that?”

“I didn’t need your help. It’s you who jumped out by yourself. Even if you said nothing, I could still handle it on my own,” said Chu Peihan, showing no gratitude to him.

Chu Peihan wasn’t ungrateful. She actually felt grateful, but she felt that Han Chenglin was very annoying, so she didn’t want to talk to him.

“You…” Han Chenglin was slightly mad, but wasn’t really angry with Chu Peihan. Instead, he felt Chu Peihan was quite adorable.

“Fine, you win.” Han Chenglin gave in. “Anyway, given my sincere performance, please teach me kung fu.”

Chu Peihan refused to reply to him, and rolled her eyes at him because she was unwilling to talk about that with him now. No matter how she refused to do that, Han Chenglin wouldn’t let her go. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“If you don’t say no, then it’s a silent yes.” Without Chu Peihan’s response, Han Chenglin begged again.

“Even if you take it as a silent yes, I won’t teach you any skills. What can you do about that?” Chu Peihan said.

“How can you be so cold-blooded? I’ve begged you for so long. You still refuse to change your mind,” said Han Chenglin confusedly.

“Why can’t you give up then? I’ve refused countless times. Can’t you give up? I can make the decision on my own. You can’t force me to do it. Let me be honest with you, I don’t like you, so I don’t want to teach you kung fu,” said Chu Peihan. She couldn’t care less about his face.

Han Chenglin wasn’t annoyed. In fact, he wouldn’t stop begging Chu Peihan not only to persuade her to teach him kung fu because he didn’t lack teachers, but because he felt that Chu Peihan was very fun and he wanted to see her more often.

“Come on, I’m so handsome. How come you don’t like me?” Han Chenglin asked in the tone of a typical narcissist.

Hearing Han Chenglin’s words, Chu Peihan rolled her eyes at him again and said with obvious disdain, “I’ve seen many men who are more handsome than you. You’re merely a nobody.”

“As long as you’re willing to teach me kung fu, I don’t care how you think of me,” said Han Chenglin airily.

Chu Peihan felt she couldn’t communicate with Han Chenglin, so she directly ran away leaving him behind.

“Hey, you!” Han Chenglin was struck dumb for a second. To his surprise, Chu Peihan suddenly ran away and he felt heavily hit.

Han Chenglin wanted to chase her, but gave it up the next second because it would greatly affect his image. Besides, he couldn’t catch up with her. Chu Peihan ran much faster than him, so it was useless even if he chased her right now.

Anyway, he would see her again. He didn’t need to rush to chase her right now.

…

Because Xu Jinchen was absent, Zi Beiying had an absent look on her face. Especially when she saw Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting showing affection in public, she felt lonelier.

Now that she had a boyfriend, she couldn’t stand it when other people showed affection in public while her boyfriend was absent. When she was single, she didn’t think it was a big problem when Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting showed affection in front of her. She felt slightly uncomfortable, but it wouldn’t affect her mood to have fun with her friends. She wasn’t so sensitive after all.

In addition, Cao Wenxin was in the same situation as her. Therefore, they sat together and drank a lot.

Gu Ning and her friends separated at 11 pm. Zi Beiying and her bodyguards went home on their own. Tang Jiakai and Cao Wenxin were staying in the Huangdeng Hotel as usual, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting sent them to there.

There were many coincidences in this world. So as soon as they entered the hotel, they met Xin Bei’s ex-girlfriend, Yu Wenjing.

Yu Wenjing was a little drunk, holding a man’s arm. Right after she finished check-in and turned around, she saw Cao Wenxin and the others behind her.

At this time, Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai walked at the front, followed by Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. Because Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai walked closely and they chatted with laughter about where to go and eat tomorrow, they seemed like a couple. As a result, Yu Wenjing believed they were a couple.

Without hesitation, she rushed to Cao Wenxin and criticized her in anger. “How dare you! Since you’re together with Xin Bei now, how can you stay in a hotel with another man? You bitch, I’m going to tell him!”

The moment Cao Wenxin saw Yu Wenjing, she frowned and directly gave Yu Wenjing a heavy slap after hearing her words.

“You…” Yu Wenjing was struck dumb after the slap. Before she came back to her senses, she heard Cao Wenxin’s cold voice. “Are you crazy? Stop attacking people!”

Yu Wenjing got her senses back and was full of fury, but she was scared of meeting Cao Wenxin’s angry eyes because Cao Wenxin had kicked her once before.
