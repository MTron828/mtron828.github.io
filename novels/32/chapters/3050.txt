3051 Feeling

“I think the mastermind is more likely to be someone else,” Li Mochen said. And the mastermind could be their enemy.

Sometimes, an official was harmed, not because he did something wrong, but because of the faction he belonged to.

Lu Changwei was an important member in their faction, so it was understandable if their enemies targeted him.

Li Mochen wouldn’t tell Leng Xiaoyao much about it, because it wouldn’t do her any good.

In fact, Leng Xiaoyao was born in a powerful family, so she was very familiar with it. She clearly knew that Lu Changfei could have been attacked because of the faction he belonged to.

“I had the same idea. Lu Changfei was not harmed because he did something wrong. It is probably the result of conflict between factions,” Leng Xiaoyao said straightforwardly.

Li Mochen and Gu Yuan were surprised that Leng Xiaoyao knew everything, and were very impressed by her.

“Miss Leng, you know a lot!” Li Mochen said meaningfully.

“I’ve read many officialdom fictions, so I know a bit about politics,” Leng Xiaoyao said with a smile.

Li Mochen and Gu Yuan said nothing when they heard Leng Xiaoyao’s answer. After all, it wasn’t difficult to understand.

“Well, don’t say that outside, or it might cause unnecessary trouble.” Li Mochen kindly reminded, although he knew Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t dumb and could behave herself.

“Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone else. I only said that because I trust you,” Leng Xiaoyao said. If she just met Li Mochen, she wouldn’t talk about sensitive topics with him, but they weren’t strangers and she knew Li Mochen very well.

She trusted him?

Li Mochen’s heart skipped a beat. He didn’t expect Leng Xiaoyao to say something like that to him.

Undeniably, he had a special feeling when she said that to him, but it only lasted for a moment.

They had just met a few times, but she said she trusted him, which wasn’t convincing.

Besides, he was suspicious of her.

“Oh? But we have only met a few times. Why do you trust me?” Li Mochen asked. He sounded very normal, but he was actually testing her.

“Why not? Sometimes people’s feelings are strange. Although we barely know each other, I feel as if we’ve known one another for a long time. I trust you, and there is no reason. I already dared to tell you some secrets that other people didn’t know about me, like hacking and stock purchasing. I can tell you right now that the stocks I bought are very likely to rise in the end. And I feel we’re going to go through many things together. I have even dreamed that you’ll encounter danger. I know it’s hard for you to believe that. You’re always suspicious of me for forming a relationship with you. I understand that. You can do an investigation about me if you want. Anyway, I have no intention of hurting you,” Leng Xiaoyao said sincerely with a resigned tone.

Looking at Leng Xiaoyao’s expression, Li Mochen didn’t think she was lying.

Given her abilities, she could easily act, but Li Mochen was somehow convinced by her this time. He wasn’t fully convinced, but was willing to trust her.

Hearing Leng Xiaoyao’s words, Gu Yuan was astonished. He didn’t expect her to have so many skills, but he had to agree with Leng Xiaoyao. Sometimes, people have strange feelings. They just met, but felt as if they had known each other for a long time.

He wasn’t sure whether Leng Xiaoyao was telling the truth, but he had a good impression of her.

Li Mochen said nothing else and sent Leng Xiaoyao to the Leng family’s mansion.

Before Leng Xiaoyao got out of the car, Li Mochen said, “Miss Leng, please continue the investigation.”

“Of course, I’ll contact you once there is a result,” Leng Xiaoyao said with a smile. Then she got out of the car and walked away.

When she got back home, it was already 11:30 pm.

Normally, the Leng family should be asleep, but they were all awake today, waiting for Leng Xiaoyao to come home.

Leng Changyuan was worried about Leng Xiaoyao, while Leng Yehua and Song Meiyu wanted to see who she was with.

Once Leng Xiaoyao was back, Leng Changyuan checked her from head to toe to see whether she was fine.

“Grandpa, I’m fine. There’s no need to worry about me.” Leng Xiaoyao immediately comforted him.

After making sure that Leng Xiaoyao was fine, Leng Changyuan was finally relieved, but he still acted mad and scolded her. “You’re so bold! How dare you run into the fire to rescue people.”

He wasn’t cold-blooded and was willing to help other people if he could in a difficult situation.

However, what Leng Xiaoyao had done was too dangerous. Even though she was fine, Leng Changyuan still found it scary.

Therefore, he hoped Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t do it again.

“I’m fine. And I did that because I had confidence, otherwise I wouldn’t have done anything. I wouldn’t risk my life to save other people,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She was honest and indeed only did things when she had confidence.

“You…” Leng Changyuan wanted to say something again, but didn’t know what to say. In the end, he gave a sign.

“Keep it in mind. Don’t take such a risk again in the future. Don’t let yourself be injured. Sometimes, it’s necessary to be selfish. Do you understand?”

“Sure, grandpa.” Leng Xiaoyao replied obediently.

Seeing that Leng Xiaoyao was fine, Leng Yehua and Song Meiyu were disappointed to some extent.

Back in her room, Leng Xiaoyao continued to investigate Jin Dawu.

At the same time, Li Mochen called his friend, Mu Yiyang, the heir of the Mu family in the capital, as soon as he left.

Mu Yiyang was waiting for Li Mochen’s call, so he answered the moment Li Mochen called him.

“Mochen, how is it now?” Mu Yiyang asked.

Because it was an emergency, Li Mochen hadn’t told Mu Yiyang much when the accident just happened. He simply said that Lu Changwei’s car suddenly exploded and that he would call Mu Yiyang again when he had time.

Therefore, Mu Yiyang was waiting for Li Mochen’s call.
