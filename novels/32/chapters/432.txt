Chapter 433 Get the Driver’s License

Cao Wenxin’s parents also hoped that she could protect herself in a dangerous situation, so she had been sent to military camp during her childhood. If she hadn’t had the ability to protect herself, she would have been kidnapped many times. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After the run, they went to have breakfast together before going back to the villa. Although Cao Wenxin lived in the villa, she never cooked for herself because she was a bad cook. She would either eat at the Cao family’s house or dine out.

Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin went back to their own place later. They took a shower and changed before going out again. Gu Ning didn’t have a driver’s license, so she got in Cao Wenxin’s car.

There were two cars in Cao Wenxin’s garage. One was the same Lamborghini as Gu Ning’s, but its color was bright red. The other one was also a red Land Rover. It seemed that Cao Wenxin really loved red.

“I think that we better keep a low profile today, so let’s drive the Land Rover,” Cao Wenxin said. She went to open the car door for Gu Ning and made a gesture like a gentleman to invite her to sit inside, which was quite amusing. Gu Ning laughed a little, and got in the car.

In fact, Gu Ning preferred off-road vehicles, like Land Rovers, Hummers, Knight XV and so on, because they looked so cool.

On the way, Gu Ning asked, “Wenxin, how much do you know about the super-rich families in City B?”

“A lot I guess,” Cao Wenxin said. As a member of high society, she had to know a lot about the surrounding people.

“Do you know a man called Pan Zirui?” Gu Ning asked. She wanted to find out more about the Pan family from Cao Wenxin.

Hearing the name, Pan Zirui, Cao Wenxin snorted with laughter and showed obvious dislike towards him. “Pan Zirui is a well-known playboy among the high society. Do you know him?”

“Yes,” Gu Ning said. “I almost had a conflict with him at the stone-gambling street the other day, but he recognized me because I rescued the injured fan at the airport. He wanted me to be his master and teach him kung fu, but I rejected, so he regarded me as his boss. I just want to know the reputation of the Pan family. If his family is notorious, I’ll keep a distance from him. If his family isn’t that bad, I think it’s not a bad idea to maintain a good relationship with him.”

“Oh, Pan Zirui is willing to follow your lead?” Cao Wenxin was greatly surprised. “He despises women so much! Ningning, you’re really charming!” Then, Cao Wenxin added, “I haven’t heard anything terrible about the Pan family yet, but maybe it’s because they hide their dirty secrets really well. Anyway, all businessmen are cunning. As long as it isn’t amoral or illegal, I think it’s fine.”

Indeed, all businessmen were cunning. Gu Ning was a cunning businesswoman too. As long as the Pan family wasn’t involved in any crimes, Gu Ning wouldn’t mind.

Seeing that it was time for the bank to open, Gu Ning made a call to transfer the money to Cao Wenxin’s and Tang Jiakai’s bank accounts.

Hearing Gu Ning talking on the phone, Cao Wenxin was still excited although she was already mentally-prepared. Five hundred million yuan! From now on, she had five hundred million yuan in her own bank account! It was still too much for Cao Wenxin to believe that Gu Ning had made three billion yuan so easily. Actually, it hadn’t been that easy. If Gu Ning hadn’t been brave and smart enough, they could have been killed, not even mentioning getting the money.

Tang Jiakai was still sleeping when he heard a new message came in, so he semi-consciously checked his phone. When he read the message and noticed the long number of the money that had just been transferred into his account, he woke up at once and screamed, jumping in great excitement on his bed. Everyone in the house was able to hear his scream.

“Tang Jiakai, stop screaming!” Tang Haifeng scolded him from downstairs, but Tang Jiakai ignored his grandpa, focusing on the number on the screen. There were so many zeros! Five hundred million yuan! Five hundred million yuan was all his own savings, and he finally didn’t have to ask his parents for an allowance anymore. However, Tang Jiakai was a well-educated young man, and he wouldn’t spend the money with reckless abandon. Instead, he could do what he always wanted to do now.

Tang Haifeng was a little worried when he didn’t hear Tang Jiakai’s answer, so he told the housekeeper to go upstairs and have a look.

“Lord Jiakai, are you alright?” the housekeeper knocked on the door, and asked worriedly.

Hearing the housekeeper’s voice, Tang Jiakai finally got his mind back. He took a long breath first, then replied. “I’m fine. I just had a nightmare.”

Hearing that Tang Jiakai was fine, the housekeeper was relieved and went back downstairs.

...

Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin left for the Department of Motor Vehicles around 8:30 am, and didn’t arrive there until 9:30 am because of traffic.

Cao Wenxin had called her friend last night, so when they arrived at the Department of Motor Vehicles, everything was well-arranged.

There was a place for the drivers’ test right next to the Department of Motor Vehicles, so they went directly there.

Once their car was parked; a handsome man who was around 25 walked towards them. The moment that Cao Wenxin got out of her car, the man complained, “Miss Cao, you really won’t call me unless you need me. You promised to buy me a meal, but I’ve waited for two weeks and you didn’t call me once.”

Hearing that, Cao Wenxin felt a little embarrassed. “I know it’s my fault. Why don’t we have lunch together today after my friend finishes the test?”

“That’s fine.” The man was satisfied.

At this time, Gu Ning came to Cao Wenxin’s side. Cao Wenxin then introduced them to each other. “This is my younger sister, Gu Ning, and this is my friend, Ouyang Sihuan.”

“Nice to meet you,” “Nice to meet you too,” Gu Ning and Ouyang Sihuan greeted each other.

“Are you ready? If you are, we can begin now,” Ouyang Sihuan asked Gu Ning.

“Yes, I’m ready,” Gu Ning said.

Before the exam, Gu Ning went to pay the registration fee first, and then it was time to do Subject 1. Subject 1 was mainly about the driving theory foundation, road safety laws and regulations, local regulations and other related knowledge. It was directly answered on the computer, so Ouyang Sihuan guided Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin to the computer room to answer the questions.

Although Gu Ning came here to attend the test with the help of Cao Wenxin’s network, it was impossible for her to cheat, because there were cameras and the computer would read her exam paper. Before long, Gu Ning finished the 100 questions, and she got a full score.

Cao Wenxin and Ouyang Sihuan were both shocked by Gu Ning’s efficiency and accuracy.
