Chapter 1882: Kill Him

He believed that Gu Ning dared to say that because she didn’t know they were cultivators. Even though she knew Jing Jining, she might not be aware of his real identity.

“I can’t defeat you on my own, but the result might be different if I cooperate with him.” Gu Ning smiled with great confidence.

Jing Jining agreed with Gu Ning. Although neither of them could defeat the cultivator alone, the situation would be different if they worked together.

Besides, since Gu Ning already came, there was no reason for him to chase her away. Even if she was willing to leave right now, the cultivator might not be willing to let her go. Therefore, Jing Jining said, “Sure.”

Hearing Jing Jining’s answer, the cultivator was surprised. He couldn’t feel any air of cultivation from Gu Ning, but Jing Jining agreed to cooperate.

It was obvious that this girl wasn’t ordinary. However, he didn’t think it was a big deal.

“Really? If so, let’s see what the result will be!” said the cultivator with disdain, then attacked Jing Jining and Gu Ning without delay. Jing Jining and Gu Ning fought back at once.

Cultivators fought against each other with magical power. If Gu Ning was really an ordinary person, she absolutely couldn’t stand it and would be beaten at any second, but she wasn’t.

At this time, Gu Ning didn’t bother to hide her magical power any longer, so she directly used magical power to fight against the cultivator.

When Jing Jining and the cultivator sensed the sudden strong magical power from Gu Ning’s body, both of them were shocked. To their surprise, Gu Ning had hidden such strong magical power in her body.

Because they were astonished, both of them were distracted for a while. Gu Ning seized this chance and attacked the cultivator like lightning. She took out a bronze dagger to stab the cultivator’s heart.

It was dark, so they didn’t pay much attention to Gu Ning’s hands, so they weren’t very surprised by the dagger which suddenly appeared in her hand.

In the blink of an eye, Gu Ning reached the front of the cultivator. The cultivator regained his senses trying to avoid it, but it was too late. He could only tilt his body and the dagger which was about to stab into his heart slightly cut his arm.

Although Gu Ning put cold magical power into the dagger and made it super sharp, she was facing a cultivator at a high level after all. It hurt the cultivator, but the injury wasn’t serious.

“Are you a cultivator as well? Why couldn’t I feel your level of cultivation?” asked the cultivator in shock. He refused to believe that Gu Ning was able to hide it.

If Gu Ning had that ability, she would be able to kill him in a second.

Jing Jining was greatly surprised too, but didn’t ask about it, because it wasn’t a suitable time. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I don’t think I have to answer that question,” said Gu Ning in a cold voice. Without a pause, she kept on attacking the cultivator.

At this time, both the cultivator and Jing Jining came back to their senses and continued to fight against each other.

The three of them moved back and forth in the woods. Gu Ning couldn’t do qinggong, but she was still able to move fast with the strength from her feet. She was fast too, but wasn’t as agile as the cultivator.

The cultivator controlled the branches and stones around to attack Gu Ning, but Gu Ning avoided all of them.

During the fight, Gu Ning learned to use her magical power to control the small stuff around her just like what the cultivator was doing.

However, neither Jing Jining nor the cultivator knew that Gu Ning just learned that from the fight.

When Jing Jining was alone, he couldn’t win the fight against the cultivator, but they soon were at an advantage once Gu Ning joined him. Moreover, the cultivator was losing control of the fight.

The cultivator knew that he was at a disadvantage and that it was meaningless to continue to fight with them, so he tried to leave, but Gu Ning and Jing Jining had no intention of letting him go right now.

After a long while, the cultivator finally failed and lost the ability to fight back.

“Jing Jining, if you kill me, the Yin family will definitely pay you back!” said the cultivator. Even though he was caught by Jing Jining now, he was still quite arrogant, because he believed that Jing Jining didn’t dare to kill him.

This cultivator was a member of the Yin family, which was one of the four dominant families in the cultivation world. His father was the second son of the Yin family and his name was Yin Shixun.

Yin Shixun was quite outstanding in the Yin family, so he had an important position in his family.

“Do you think I’m afraid of the Yin family? No one will know it even if I kill you right now,” said Jing Jining with disdain.

“You...” Yin Shixun realized this problem as well and turned pale in an instant.

Was Jing Jining really going to kill him? If Jing Jining really killed him right now, he had no ability to fight back.

“Besides, you just tried to kill me first. There is no reason for me to let you go right now. You also had the thought that the Jing family won’t know it even if you kill me here. Do you think I’ve forgotten what you did to me 10 years ago? Since you know that Yunyao is still alive, I can’t let you go to tell the Jing family,” said Jing Jining coldly, looking at Yin Shixun who was his enemy.

Jing Jining had no intention of letting him go, because he had tried to kill him many times. Besides, he had found out that Jing Yunyao was still alive.

The four dominant families never stopped secretly competing against each other. All the other three dominant families were aware of the Jing family’s bad relationship with Jing Yunyao. As a result, once they learned that Jing Yunyao was still alive, they would definitely leak the news to the Jing family, because they wanted to see the Jing family in a mess.

Gu Ning was also annoyed when she heard that Yin Shixun already knew that Jing Yunyao was still alive. She was also sure that Yin Shixun would tell the Jing family about that if he could survive tonight. If so, Leng Shaoting would be in danger too.

Jing Yunyao was strong and she could escape and save herself even if she couldn’t defeat the strongest member of the Jing family. Besides, Jing Yunyao was in the capital. If she encountered any danger, Shangguan Yang could help her.

Leng Shaoting, however, needed to travel around because of his job, so he was in a more dangerous situation.

Even though Leng Shaoting had the flood dragon by his side, Gu Ning was still worried about his safety. Therefore, she would never allow Yin Shixun to stay alive.

The Jing family would know that Jing Yunyao was still alive and Leng Shaoting was her son sooner or later, but Leng Shaoting needed time to grow stronger.

“Kill him,” said Gu Ning to Jing Jining.
