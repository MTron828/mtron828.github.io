Chapter 2535: The Shooting Begins

“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the launching ceremony of Life After Life, Legend of Demon Flower. This drama is being produced by Fenghua Entertainment, directed by famous director Lu Zhan, and is starring Qiao Hanchen, Su Tongnuo, Han Lengxuan, Bai Lin, and other well-known actors. It tells a story of…”

“Now, the crew will formally start the shooting at today’s launching ceremony by lighting incense sticks together. Let’s wish Life After Life, Legend of Demon Flower a smooth shooting and a high rating!”

The moment the host finished, all the important guests, main actors, and Gu Ning burned incense sticks with one accord.

After that, Lu Chao, as the boss, gave a speech. Gu Ning didn’t come today as the boss.

Then the producer and director gave a speech. In fact, the producer and director was both Lu Zhan.

After Lu Zhan gave a speech, the main actors went on the stage to say a few words.

Finally, the director announced the formal beginning of the shooting, and lifted the red cloth on the video camera.

In the end, they took a group photo, which was the end of the launching ceremony.

Although the launching ceremony was over, the shooting didn’t start right away. The guests and reporters needed to have a meal together first.

The restaurant was at the foot of Qianling Mountain. It wasn’t large, but it was a scenic spot, so there were good restaurants.

They often ate varied delicious food, though the crew usually had takeout during the shooting.

Gu Ning also stayed and shared a meal with the other people. And because Baili Zongxue came with Gu Ning, she stayed too.

After the meal, some people left, while the whole crew of Life After Life, Legend of Demon Flower stayed for a meeting.

Gu Ning didn’t join them, so she went to walk around with Baili Zongxue. When Chu Peihan was done, they would leave together.

…

Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue went to a square. When it was only the two of them, Baili Zongxue said, “Oh, Senior Shangguan’s house has been built. “”I walked by it the other day, and I took some photos. Do you want to see it?”

Saying that, Baili Zongxue took out her phone and showed Gu Ning the pictures.

Gu Ning had a look and thought it was beautiful.

It was Shangguan Yang’s house, but it was also another home for her and Leng Shaoting.

They were cultivators, so they could live much longer. They couldn’t stay in the mortals’ world forever.

After dozens of years, people who were the same age as them would die, while they still aged slowly. It would be strange and cause unnecessary trouble if they showed up in public again. As a result, they would disappear from the public by then.

“There are more,” said Baili Zongxue, then Gu Ning saw more.

However, she noticed Jing Jining’s back in the third picture. Although there was only his back, Gu Ning immediately recognized it.

Because Gu Ning didn’t know that Jing Jining was forbidden to leave the cultivation world, she wasn’t surprised that Jing Jining was in the cultivation world now. After all, it was where Jing Jining’s home was located.

Jing Jining stayed at home to cultivate these days, but he sometimes went out for a walk. Anyway, Jing Yaorong only forbade him to leave the cultivation world, not the Jing family’s house. Therefore, Jing Jining went to see Shangguang Yang’s house once in a while.

However, when he went out, Jing Yaorong’s people would follow him.

“When will you move in?” asked Baili Zongxue.

“When it’s not appropriate for us to continue to stay in the mortal world. Dozens of years later, our peers will age and die. At that time, we’ll leave the mortal world and live with other identities. Otherwise people might think we’re monsters if we stay young. I don’t want to cause unnecessary trouble,” said Gu Ning.

Actually, it was sad that all of her friends would become very old while she could still stay young. It meant that they would soon leave her. Her parents and other family members would leave her as well.

“Right, it makes me sad when I realize that my friends will age much faster than me.” Baili Zongxue felt Gu Ning. “I didn’t have many friends in the cultivation world before. There aren’t many people in the cultivation world actually, and people spend most of their time cultivating. I can only play with my own sisters. I studied in the outside world, but the friends I made always quarreled with me about some unimportant things. I rarely had a long friendship. Luckily, I met you afterwards. Although I had to keep my real family background a secret, we’re real friends. So it’s really hard to see my close friends age faster than me.”

“Alright, stop talking about that now. No matter what, we have to face it in the future,” said Gu Ning. It was sad, but she persuaded herself to accept it.

“Great, let’s drop that topic.” Baili Zongxue nodded and stopped thinking about it.

They chatted as they walked till a small forest with no one inside. Because they were talking about cultivators, they needed to stay away from the crowd. However, Gu Ning suddenly felt a cultivator rapidly running towards them. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The cultivator seemed weak, which meant he or she was at an average level.

Gu Ning sensed the cultivator before Baili Zongxue, so she directly turned around to look at the cultivator.

It was a girl who was about seventeen years old. She was pretty, but her level wasn’t high, so her real age should be slightly above twenty.

She looked angry, staring straight at Baili Zongxue. Obviously, Baili Zongxue was her target.

“Someone is going to attack you!” Gu Ning reminded Baili Zongxue.

Hearing that, Baili Zongxue turned around and also saw a girl walking towards her not far away.

They could feel each other now, but there were many cultivators going in and out at Qianling Mountain, so they weren’t surprised.
