3009 Yu Asked for It Himself

Because of that, Han Yu felt much less pain from the wound. Although he woke up in pain, it was tolerable.

Most importantly, Han Yu was conscious, and didn’t lose his senses. He could speak, and only felt a little weak.

Therefore, except for Leng Xiaoyao, everyone was surprised. It was like a miracle!

They understood that it was because of Leng Xiaoyao’s effort.

“M-Miss Leng, thank y-you.” Han Yu did his best to speak and thanked Leng Xiaoyao.

“There is no need to thank me. After all, it wasn’t free, but you can pay me after you have made a full recovery and are sure that you’re all better. I’m not afraid that you’ll deny it,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Actually, she hadn’t planned to ask Han Yu for money at the beginning, but she changed her mind after he threatened her. Therefore, he needed to pay her fifty million yuan.

“Of course, Miss Leng. I won’t deny it,” Han Yu said. He was more than happy to pay her fifty million yuan, since it was nothing in his eyes.

Even if it would cost him a fortune, he wouldn’t complain. After all, he could make more money as long as he was healthy, but if he lost his life, it would be meaningless no matter how much money he had.

“I’ve prepared a medicine made of herbs to improve your blood circulation. Mr. Lu is watching it boil now. It should be done in half an hour. There is enough for a week. You can take the medicine during the following week. Take a bowl of it twice a day. As for the herbs you need to apply to the wound, you don’t need to change it frequently. Once every three days is enough. During the recovery, you can let Doctor Tai check your body. I don’t think there will be anything wrong, but if anything happens, let me know anytime,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Great, I know.” Han Yu answered. He would listen to Leng Xiaoyao regarding his treatment.

“Alright, I should go back now,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“It’s already 12 pm now. Why don’t you have a meal before you leave?” Ji Yanxi asked.

“No need, I’ll deal with it on my own,” Leng Xiaoyao refused.

“Lu Lin can send you back,” Han Yu said.

“Thanks, but he’s watching the boiling medicine. I’ve told him what he needs to do,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Since she said that, Han Yu didn’t insist, and Leng Xiaoyao left soon afterwards.

Once she was gone, Tai Junli asked, “How much did she ask for it?”

“Fifty million yuan.” Ji Yanxi replied.

“What? Fifty million yuan?” Tai Junli was shocked and almost bit his tongue. “Did I hear that correctly? That’s too much! Didn’t she agree to do the operation for Yu for Leng Yecheng’s sake? Why did she still ask for so much money? Even five million yuan is too much, let alone fifty million yuan. If you go to the best hospital and let the best doctor do the operation, it might only cost you five hundred thousand yuan at most.”

Tai Junli couldn’t accept it and immediately had the worst impression of Leng Xiaoyao. He was grateful to Leng Xiaoyao for healing Han Yu earlier, but now she seemed like a thief in his eyes.

“Yeah, you heard it correctly, but don’t be mad, and don’t blame Leng Xiaoyao, because Yu asked for it himself. At the very beginning, Leng Xiaoyao proposed to do it free, but Yu threatened her due to lack of trust. He said he would pay her and Leng Yecheng back if the operation failed. If he only threatened Leng Xiaoyao, she would have accepted it, but he mentioned Leng Yecheng too, so Leng Xiaoyao got angry and asked for such a large sum of money,” Ji Yanxi said resignedly.

“I understand why she did that. She was willing to help because of Leng Yecheng, but Yu threatened him. Leng Yecheng is completely innocent in this matter, and he’s Yu’s close friend. However, Yu used him to put pressure on Leng Xiaoyao. It’s very normal that Leng Xiaoyao is mad. It was totally up to Yu whether he wanted to do the operation. Leng Xiaoyao didn’t force him,” Ji Yanxi explained.

Hearing that, Tai Junli didn’t know what to say, and felt guilty for having a bad impression of Leng Xiaoyao.

Even though he still felt fifty million yuan was too much, he might have refused to do the operation if he were Leng Xiaoyao!

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t refuse to help Han Yu and only asked for a lot of money, which wasn’t a bad result.

Ji Yanxi also said that it was totally up to Han Yu whether he wanted to do the operation, so it was a deal between them.

What was most important was that Han Yu survived under Leng Xiaoyao’s care.

Anyway, fifty million yuan wasn’t much for Han Yu.

Even if it cost more, it wasn’t more important than his life.

Therefore, he was happy that Han Yu survived.

…

After Leng Xiaoyao left, she didn’t return to the Leng family’s house right away. Instead, she decided to have a walk by the sea.

City Chang was near the ocean, but the Leng family’s house was located in the city center, which was far from the ocean. Leng Xiaoyao needed to spend about one and a half hours on the road if going by car. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

However, that actually wasn’t so far in a large city.

…

Leng Yuqi went out at about 10 am.

Chu Jianan didn’t come over to pick her up because their parents didn’t allow them to be together, so they wanted to attract as little attention as possible.

Once Leng Yuqi met Chu Jianan, they left.

“Jianan, where are we going?” asked Leng Yuqi.

“Why don’t we go to the sea? I booked a room at a popular love hotel over there. It’s a good day today. We can hang out and come back after having dinner. I’ll drive you to your evening class,” Chu Jianan suggested.

“Sure!” Leng Yuqi answered. She looked calm, but couldn’t help thinking more when she heard about the love hotel. She wondered what they would do there?

She hoped they could do something, because it would help them get closer.

But they went there during the day and wouldn’t stay there for a night, so nothing special should happen!

No matter how much Leng Yuqi wanted to do something different with Chu Jianan, she wouldn’t show it on her face. She wanted to leave a good impression on Chu Jianan.

When Leng Yuqi and Chu Jianan arrived at the popular love hotel by the sea, it was nearly 12 pm, so they went to have a fine seafood meal.

After the meal, they ambled by the ocean.
