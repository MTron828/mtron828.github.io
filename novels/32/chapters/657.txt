Chapter 658 Biological Cousins

“The girl who just talked with me is actually the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry and Charm, Miss Gu,” Yu Zi said.

“What? She is the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry and Charm?” Hearing that, everyone was shocked. They all ached to see the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry and Charm, but had failed to recognize her when she appeared!

“Miss Yu, why didn’t you tell us?” someone complained.

“Exactly! I’m Goddess Gu’s loyal fan!” Several women said around Yu Zi, but Yu Zi didn’t know what to say, because those women had just been jealous of Gu Ning’s outstanding appearance.

Gu Ning and the others left for the Huangdeng Hotel once they walked out of the shopping mall.

On the way, Xin Bei received Xu Jinchen’s call, but he was driving, so Leng Shaoting answered it.

Leng Shaoting told Xu Jinchen the address, and Xu Jinchen would drive there himself. Afterwards, Leng Shaoming called Si Ming and told him to meet them there.

When they were about to arrive at the hotel, Gu Ning called Gao Yi and Qiao Ya, and told them to meet her in the hall.

The moment Gu Ning and the others walked inside, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya noticed them and walked to her. “Nice to see you, Miss Gu!”

Gu Ning and Qiao Ya always called Gu Ning, Miss Gu, in public. They then greeted Leng Shaoting. Because Leng Shaoting was Gu Ning’s boyfriend, they had to be respectful. As for Cao Wenxin and Xin Bei, they didn’t know them, so they just acknowledged them by nodding

Once Xin Bei met Gao Yi and Qiao Ya, he sensed that they weren’t ordinary people, but were as well-trained as him. He didn’t think that they were soldiers, but their hands must have touched human blood. Xin Bei wouldn’t explore their real identity, but he wouldn’t have found anything anyway.

“Please give the boxes to them,” Gu Ning said to Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei

Hearing that, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya moved a step forward and took the boxes without delay.

“How can you let a woman carry heavy stuff!” Cao Wenxin was dissatisfied. She didn’t realize that Qiao Ya wasn’t a common woman, but just felt that Qiao Ya was a little cold. Anyway, Qiao Ya was a woman, and the two big men’s hands were empty now.

Hearing that, Xin Bei felt embarrassed, and walked ahead to take the boxes back, in case he left a bad impression on Cao Wenxin.

“It’s fine. She can handle it,” Gu Ning said

Since Gu Ning said so, Cao Wenxin didn’t insist.

“They are my subordinates, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya.” Gu Ning introduced. “This is my older cousin, Cao Wenxin, and this is Shaoting’s close brother, Xin Bei.”

“Older cousin? Wenxin is your older cousin?” Xin Bei was surprised.

Cao Wenxin’s mother was born in the Tang family. If Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin were cousins, Gu Ning must be a member of the Tang family too. However, Gu Ning’s family name wasn’t Tang.

“What? Anything wrong with that?” Cao Wenxin opened her mouth before Gu Ning could, and seemed displeased.

“Biological cousins?” Xin Bei asked.

“Of course!” Cao Wenxin said with pride.

After that, Gu Ning walked to the reception, and a waiter guided them to the banquet hall.

They booked the No.1 banquet hall, which was one thousand six hundred square-meters large, and it was already well-prepared.

While they were checking the hall, Si Ming and Qiu Yuxin arrived.

“Hey, Gu Ning, Good for you! You are now the national goddess,” Si Ming joked, but he really admired Gu Ning.

“You’re even more famous than me now! I’m so jealous of you,” Qiu Yuxin teased.

“Ha-ha, I guess nobody can resist my charm,” Gu Ning also joked.

“I do respect your charm because it made Shaoting fall in love with you,” Si Ming said. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Me too!” Xin Bei and Cao Wenxin agreed.

Leng Shaoting looked to Gu Ning with his eyes full of love for her, and Gu Ning flushed.

Right at this moment, Gu Ning’s phone rang. It was Su Tongnuo’s call. Gu Ning had told her to meet in the hotel, so Su Tongnuo didn’t contact Gu Ning until she arrived. Su Tongnuo then walked into the banquet hall.

“Nice to see you again, Miss Gu!” Su Tongnuo and Lin Xiaoxia greeted Gu Ning politely. Gu Ning had told them not to call her boss in public.

“Hi!” Gu Ning nodded at them.

After that, Su Tongnuo turned to greet Cao Wenxin. “Been a while, Wenxin!” Although Su Tongnuo and Cao Wenxin weren’t very familiar, they weren’t strangers either.

“Tongnuo, you’re really successful now!” Cao Wenxin smiled and joked.

“It’s all because of you, and I seriously don’t know how to thank you enough!” Su Tongnuo said with sincerity. If Cao Wenxin hadn’t introduced her to Gu Ning, she could still be shut out from the entertainment industry right now!

“It’s no big deal. We’re friends after all,” Cao Wenxin said with a smile.

Afterwards, Gu Ning introduced Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei to Su Tongnuo. When Su Tongnuo saw them, she was stunned by their outstanding appearances too.

They went to dine together after checking the hall.

When they went back to the hotel lobby, Gu Ning used her Black Card to book a standard room for Su Tongnuo and Lin Xiaoxia, and a presidential suite for Gao Yi.

Gu Ning left the gowns with Gao Yi and told him to take care of them.

The models would arrive two hours early tomorrow morning, and they need to have a rehearsal before they put on make-up and clothing and waited for the show.

Gu Ning would bring jade jewelry with her tomorrow and models could wear it then.
