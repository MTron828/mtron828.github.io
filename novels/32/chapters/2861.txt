Chapter 2862: I Didn’t Agree

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“If you plan to do the business on your own, we can cooperate, but I can’t stop Jiang Dashun from causing you trouble. I can only promise to provide you with goods. If you’re willing to work for me, I can hire you too and I can protect you by stopping Jiang Dashun from causing you trouble again. I only want you to be loyal and reliable. As for your future, it relies on your own abilities,” said Gu Ning.

Hearing that, not only Jiang Wenliang was also surprised.

Jiang Wenliang was so lucky today! He had help from a rich girl and the girl even offered him a job.

“Miss, I don’t know what to say. I don’t think I deserve this, and…” Jiang Wenliang felt guilty since he gained a lot without paying anything. Therefore, he decided to turn Gu Ning down.

However, before he finished, Gu Ning interrupted. “If you have other worries, they won’t be a problem. I can help you, but if you’re unwilling to work for me, I won’t force you.”

Although Gu Ning wanted to hire him, she still needed his willingness.

“I…” Jiang Wenliang suddenly had no idea what to say.

Gu Ning didn’t continue. Instead, she took out her name card and handed it to Jiang Wenliang. “Think about it. After you make up your mind, call me.”

Although Jiang Wenliang didn’t think he would agree, he still took Gu Ning’s name card. “Sure, thank you so much for your kindness. I’ll think about it.”

“Great.” Gu Ning nodded, then walked away.

Seeing that, Jiang Wenliang shouted, “Miss, your jade!”

He thought Gu Ning forgot it.

“That’s your jade. Didn’t we talk about it?” said Gu Ning.

“But I said I only want my ancestral house,” said Jiang Wenliang.

“I didn’t agree on that,” said Gu Ning. Afterwards, she turned around and left without looking back.

“Well…” Jiang Wenliang wanted to chase after her, but Gu Ning walked away too fast. And the jade was left behind, so he couldn’t leave.

Anyway, he had Gu Ning’s phone number so he could return the jade to her later.

Even though Gu Ning said that he could have the jade, he didn’t think he should take it. He still wanted to return the jade.

Other people, however, couldn’t be more jealous of Jiang Wenliang at this moment.

“Jiang Wenliang is so lucky today!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Right, the girl helped him get his ancestral house back and even gave him two pieces of jade! The jade should be worth over ten million yuan!”

Because the first jade wasn’t fully cut out yet and the second one just showed a little, nobody knew how much it was worth.

However, it was worth at least ten million yuan.

Therefore, everyone was jealous of Jiang Wenliang for getting so much money so easily, but they were all ordinary people, so none of them had the idea of stealing Jiang Wenliang’s money.

“I wish I could be so lucky.”

“Wow, I’m so envious of him.”

“Me too!”

“…”

Jiang Wenliang honestly didn’t think he could keep the two pieces of jade. He liked them, and wanted them because they were free. If he sold them, he wouldn’t need to work for years! However, he had his own principles and felt that it was already enough that Gu Ning helped him get his ancestral house back.

Anyway, he wouldn’t talk about it with onlookers.

A while later, the jade was mostly rubbed out from the third raw jade material. Upon seeing its quality, the crowd got excited once more because it was an old-pit-glass type with a high level.

Even Jiang Wenliang was stunned.

They thought that there might just be middle or low level jade, but unexpectedly the jade was of high level.

“Mr. Jiang, are you willing to sell this jade?” At this moment, someone asked Jiang Wenliang. Although Gu Ning told them that she would sell after the jade was fully cut out, she had given the jade to Jiang Wenliang, so they needed to ask him.

If they bought it now, they wouldn’t need to pay a lot of money for it, but it was still risky, because no one knew how large the jade was. It might just be a thin layer or very small, but if it was a whole piece, they could make a fortune.

“Sorry, I won’t sell it,” said Jiang Wenliang. He was going to return the jade to Gu Ning, so he wouldn’t sell it.

Hearing that, several potential buyers were disappointed, but they couldn’t force Jiang Wenliang to sell the jade.

After the two pieces of jade were cut out, everyone got jealous because they were worth at least thirty million yuan!

“Mr. Jiang, are you sure you won’t sell them? If you sell them, you can get a lot of money! And you’ll be able to do what you want.” Someone tried to persuade Jiang Wenliang to sell the jade, because it was rare to get this type.

“No,” Jiang Wenliang said with determination.

In that case, the other people could do nothing about it, so Jiang Wenliang left with the jade.

Jiang Wenliang was afraid he would be targeted and robbed while carrying the jade, which was the last thing he wanted to see.

As a result, he wanted to call Gu Ning after walking out of the store.

Coincidentally, before he could call Gu Ning, he saw her. At that moment, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were walking back to meet Kang Shaojie.

Without delay, Jiang Wenliang walked towards Gu Ning.

When he got close to them, he clearly felt stressed by Leng Shaoting. It seemed that Leng Shaoting wasn’t an ordinary man.

No matter who Leng Shaoting was, it had nothing to do with Jiang Wenliang, so he didn’t think much about it.

“Miss Gu!” Jiang Wenliang stopped Gu Ning and said, “I was looking for you! The jade is fully cut out, but I really can’t take them. They’re too expensive and are worth at least thirty million yuan. You’ve already done me a big favor by helping me get my ancestral house back. I honestly have no idea how to return your kindness. I won’t be able to sleep well if I keep your jade as well.”

The fact that he ran to return the jade to Gu Ning proved he was an upright man.

“Mr. Jiang, carry them steadily. Let’s talk as we walk together,” Gu Ning said, but she didn’t take the jade from Jiang Wenliang.

“Sure.” Jiang Wenliang didn’t know what Gu Ning was going to tell him, but he still listened to her.

“Mr. Jiang, I help other people according to my mood. Since I said the jade is yours, I decided to give it to you. If I want to, I can cut out jade anytime I want. And I already have a lot of jade. I don’t lack it. You should have witnessed my abilities, right?”
