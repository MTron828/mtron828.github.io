3483 Do You Dare to Swear?
“Nice to meet you too, Elder Ling Chen.” Leng Xiaoyao replied.

Then, Li Mochan told Ling Chen about what had happened yesterday.

Li Mochan didn’t pay much attention to those two people at first, but he mentioned Ling Chen yesterday, so he casually mentioned it to Ling Chen today. However, Ling Chen looked mad after hearing about it.

“They won’t let it go and will seek revenge, but they know they are no match for you, so they have probably told Ling Feng that we colluded and asked him to come forward. If that’s the case, by the time I came out, Lingfeng might have already followed me,” Ling Chen said. He didn’t blame Li Mochen. Based on his understanding of them, he thought that they would tell Ling Feng.

“I have set up a barrier, so even if he comes, he won’t be able to find us,” Li Mochan said. He had underestimated those two golden core cultivators.

“Anyway, he’s already suspicious of me. So even if he finds out, it doesn’t matter. I have already made all the necessary arrangements and can strike at any time,” Ling Chen said. As someone who wanted to become the sect leader, Ling Chen was naturally eager.

Once he became the sect leader, he would be in charge of all the resources of the sect, and even he would have a lot of resources.

Although being a sect leader involved many responsibilities, not everything needed to be handled by the leader. The sect was divided into various departments, and many things were handled by the department heads. Only major issues required the sect leader’s decision.

If the sect leader went on retreat, the elders would discuss and make decisions on behalf of the sect.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Therefore, even as a sect leader, there would still be time for cultivation.

“In that case, let’s visit Tiancheng Sect directly as your honored guests today!” Li Mochan said eagerly. He couldn’t wait to get revenge.

Although killing Ling Feng was easy for him, he couldn’t do it directly. He wanted him to admit his crimes in front of everyone so that the disciples who died because of him could rest in peace.

The deployment was to prevent Ling Feng’s supporters from rebelling and to keep them in check.

“Okay.” Ling Chen agreed.

After discussing it, Li Mochen removed the barrier and took Leng Yan and others with him to visit Tiancheng Sect with Ling Chen.

After not finding Ling Chen in Tianshui Town, Ling Feng returned to Tiancheng Sect because he didn’t want Ling Chen to find out that he was following him.

Soon, someone reported that Elder Ling Chen had brought a group of golden core cultivators to the Tiancheng Sect’s place. Ling Feng hurried over to see what was going on.

When he saw that it was just a group of golden core cultivators brought back by Ling Chen, his guard was immediately lowered. It seemed that he had thought too much this time.

He ignored them and was about to leave.

However, as soon as he turned around, he felt a terrifying pressure coming from behind him. He looked back and saw the person he thought was a golden core cultivator, then got angry.

The man wasn’t a golden core cultivator at all, but a out-of-body lord!

It seemed that he had thought too little. Ling Chen really colluded with masters and came for him.

“What do you mean by doing this?” Ling Feng angrily asked. Ling Chen didn’t stop him, so their intentions were clear.

“Just want you to stay for a while longer,” Li Mochen said calmly, but he couldn’t help feeling resentful towards Ling Feng.

“Humph! Keep me here for a while?” Ling Feng snorted coldly. It was obvious that the man was unkind to him. “What do you want to do by keeping me here?”

“I want to practice with you,” Li Mochen said. Although he looked calm, facing Ling Feng, he still harbored hatred in his heart.

“You, an out-of-body lord, want to spar with me, a Yuan Ying immortal? Are you sure you are not bullying me?” Ling Feng said coldly, then he looked at Ling Chen. “Elder Ling Chen, are you bringing someone back to seize the throne?”

Many people rushed over because they felt the pressure and they heard what Lingfeng said by chance.

Although they were affected by the pressure, it was only a slight impact because they weren’t the target.

“Ling Chen, what do you mean?” The eldest elder asked angrily.

The eldest elder sided with Ling Feng and had participated in the attack on the previous sect leader, so he was more inclined to protect Ling Feng.

“Nothing. It’s just that this Taoist friend has come to seek revenge, so let them resolve their own affairs,” Ling Chen said.

Ling Feng was startled. Could it be that he really came for revenge?

Ling Feng also knew that he had offended many people, so it wasn’t impossible for someone to come seeking revenge, but he still felt that things weren’t that simple.

“I don’t know what grudge I have with this Taoist friend?” Ling Feng asked.

“Ling Yin,” Li Mochen said in a flat tone.
Upon hearing that, Ling Feng and the eldest elder were both angry. They never thought that this man had come for Ling Yin.

The other elders and disciples were also shocked.

Some people had suspected that the destruction of Ling Yin was related to Ling Feng, but they had no evidence. Over time, they forgot about it.

Ling Yin suddenly disappeared back then, and they couldn’t find any trace of him on Guiyun, so who did it to him couldn’t be verified.

Suddenly, a man came to see them. It seemed that Ling Feng was really related to Ling Yin’s death!

“What does it have to do with me?” Ling Feng refused to admit it.

“Your clone did it. What do you mean it has nothing to do with you?” Li Mochen sneered. “And, I’m Ling Yin’s clone. So I know who did it to him.”

“What?”

Upon hearing that, everyone was surprised. This man turned out to be the former sect leader’s clone?

And it was Ling Feng’s clone who went to kill the former sect leader.

No wonder he had an alibi!

“Do you need to explain it?” Li Mochen asked.

“You are slandering me. I didn’t attack the former sect leader. Who knows who he offended that caused him to be attacked.” Ling Feng wouldn’t admit it. Even if Li Mochen was Ling Yin’s clone, he couldn’t just say whatever he wanted.

“Can you swear to it?” Li Mochen said.

Ling Feng’s face turned pale. He didn’t expect Li Mochen to make him swear.

He surely didn’t dare to swear.

“Humph! Who do you think you are? Why should I listen to you?” Ling Feng said.

“If you dare not swear, then you are guilty, but I dare to swear,” Li Mochen said. Then he took an oath. “I, Li Mochen, swear that if it isn’t for Ling Feng’s clone bringing people to interrupt Ling Yin’s promotion that caused Ling Yin’s destruction, I’ll be punished by the heavenly thunder.”
