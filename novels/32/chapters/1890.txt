Chapter 1891: Want You Badly

Gu Ning and her friends also helped Zhang Zikai make up the bed after helping her move.

They rested for a while, then went to their classrooms for their classes.

Zhang Zikai and Gu Ning had the same major but were in different classes, so they would have classes on the same floor in the same teaching building. There was only one classroom in between.

Therefore, when they arrived, they separated, with Gu Ning and Zhang Zikai going to their classrooms together.

Once they walked into their classrooms, they heard everyone talking about the drama on their school forum today. They were all criticizing Rong Zechen, because Gu Ning and Yuan Shuyan were attacked on the Internet because of him.

Some thought that Rong Zechen just made a mistake out of kindness, but more believed that it was Rong Zechen’s wishful thinking. He showed no respect towards Gu Ning or Yuan Shuyan, and there was a problem with his character.

“Gu Ning, I heard that Rong Zechen has apologized to you. Is it true?”

The second Gu Ning showed up, a student asked her with concern.

“Yeah, he did,” said Gu Ning.

“He should apologize for his terrible behavior. Although he went to question Yuan Shuyan because he was worried that she might bully you, you were criticized because of him.”

“Right, I actually think there is a big problem with Rong Zechen’s character because he refused to apologize at the very beginning when the truth came out. He also arrogantly warned Yuan Shuyan not to do it again,” said another student.

Hearing that, everyone agreed.

Gu Ning said nothing, but she didn’t deny that Rong Zechen’s character indeed wasn’t very good. He had wronged Yuan Shuyan, but refused to apologize and caused such a great scene.

When the evening class was over, Gu Ning left the classroom and saw Zhang Zikai walking out of her classroom. Zhang Zikai then walked to her and they left together.

Gu Ning didn’t ask Zhang Zikai until they were out of the teaching building and away from the crowd, “We don’t rush to go back to the dorm room. We go train for an hour in the small woods over there. Do you want to go with us?”

“Train? What training?” asked Zhang Zikai curiously.

“Miaoge had a bet with another girl. They are going to have a competition of fighting skills. The loser has to wear a bikini and pole dance before uploading the video to the Internet. It’s only a week away, so Zong Xue and I are busy training her these days. We don’t want her to lose, otherwise Song Miaoge will be publicly humiliated,” Gu Ning said.

“What? Why did she agree to that? It can’t have been set by Song Miaoge!” said Zhang Zikai. Even though she just met Song Miaoge, she felt it couldn’t be Song Miaoge’s idea.

“Yeah, the other girl proposed it, but Miaoge was impulsive back then, so she accepted it. She regretted it afterwards, but it was too late, because they had written it on paper. It’ll be humiliating if she denies it. Even her family can be affected,” said Gu Ning.

“If so, she must win the competition. What’s the probability of her winning?” asked Zhang Zikai, feeling worried for Song Miaoge.

Since Song Miaoge was Gu Ning’s friend, she took her as her friend too. They weren’t familiar right now, but they would be as time went by.

“She was doomed to fail before we trained her, but she has made great progress after half a month of training. I think the probability should be around 70%,” said Gu Ning.

Although Ji Wenna was stronger than Song Miaoge, there wasn’t a huge gap. Ji Wenna had indeed defeated Song Miaoge, but she wasn’t at a great advantage. Therefore, it wasn’t very difficult for Song Miaoge to surpass Ji Wenna.

“Only a 70% probability? She must train more to make sure that she’s going to win! I’ll go with you,” said Zhang Zikai. Since none of them would be going back to the dorm room, she would be bored to be alone there.

When Gu Ning and Zhang Zikai arrived at the same old place in the small woods, Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue were already there in the middle of training.

Because they seized every minute, they directly ran there, while Gu Ning came slower along with Zhang Zikai.

Baili Zongxue and Song Miaoge were busy sparring, so Gu Ning and Zhang Zikai watched from the side.

Zhang Zikai was only an ordinary girl, so she was quite nervous watching Baili Zongxue fighting with Song Miaoge with a lot of strength.

At the same time, she was quite envious of their good fighting skills, because no one would dare to bully them as long as they were strong. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Gu Ning, can you teach me as well after my arm is fully recovered?” Zhang Zikai asked Gu Ning with her eyes full of anticipation.

“Sure, but it’ll be tiring,” said Gu Ning.

“I’m not afraid,” said Zhang Zikai.

They trained for an hour there every night before going back to their dorm room and went to bed right afterwards.

At 11 pm, Gu Ning chatted with Leng Shaoting on WeChat. Leng Shaoting was in the military region now, so there was signal. He could contact Gu Ning at any time as long as he was free.

Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting earlier that she needed to train Song Miaoge, so she wouldn’t be free until 11 pm. As a result, they basically contacted each other after 11 pm.

Because Gu Ning lived in the dorm room, it wasn’t convenient for them to call each other, so they used WeChat.

Once Leng Shaoting was free, he would send Gu Ning a message at 11 pm.

Leng Shaoting: Ningning, what are you doing?

Gu Ning: I just finished washing. I’m in bed now.

Reading that sentence, Leng Shaoting suddenly felt excited. Giving a glance at his own bed, he wished that Gu Ning were by his side at this moment.

Leng Shaoting: I wish you were next to me in my bed right now!

Reading that message, Gu Ning flushed.

Gu Ning: I have the same wish.

Leng Shaoting squinted at Gu Ning’s reply, and subconsciously swallowed. He had to admit that he was aroused.

Leng Shaoting: Ningning.

Gu Ning: What?

Leng Shaoting: You aroused me. I want you so badly right now.

Gu Ning flushed redder.

Gu Ning: Come back to the capital!

Leng Shaoting: I will! I’ll f*ck you till you can’t leave the bed.

Gu Ning’s whole face turned red at this moment.

When it was almost 11:30 pm, Gu Ning suddenly had a vision. She saw K and Chen Cangyi’s car being stopped by two cars all of a sudden. Eight men got out of the two cars with iron rods, then heavily beat K and Chen Cangyi’s car without hesitation.

The picture ended, and Gu Ning abruptly sat up. Although she didn’t see what happened afterwards, she knew that K and Chen Cangyi would be in great trouble. After all, neither K nor Chen Cangyi was good at fighting. They were absolutely no match for eight strong men with iron rods.
