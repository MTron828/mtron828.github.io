Chapter 1179 A Traitor

She didn’t think her parents would ignore her just because they had another child.Tang Jiakai cared about Gu Ning’s feelings, which is why he asked her that question.

“I do want them to have another child, because I think they aren’t very old and they’re very healthy. I’m going to study in the capital and I’ll be busy dealing with my businesses too, so they won’t be lonely if they have another child by their side,” Gu Ning said.

Tang Jiakai nodded. Since Gu Ning didn’t mind, he would love to see the Tang family had another member.

“Oh, can you tell me more details about what happened to your friend? I don’t think it’s as simple as you said,” Gu Ning asked.

Tang Jiakai put on a serious expression at once.

“You’re right. It’s not simple at all,” he said.

His close friend’s name was Teng Xiaoyu.

It wasn’t an accident that Teng Xiaoyu was injured, it was a trap.

There was a large-scale college basketball competition being held recently, and it was the selection of college basketball teams across the country. The finals would be held the next week, and there were six basketball teams competing for the champion.

Teng Xiaoyu’s team would represent City B.

Their team gained this chance out of hundreds of basketball teams in City B, so it was obvious that they were very outstanding.

However, they had a traitor in their team and he knocked Teng Xiaoyu down during their training, causing Teng Xiaoyu to break his leg. Although Teng Xiaoyu wasn’t disabled, it would take a long time for him to recover. They didn’t have enough time for it.

Luckily, they caught the traitor and forced him to tell them the truth. It turned out that the traitor was threatened by someone from another basketball team. Teng Xiaoyu was the most noticeable member in their team, so he became the target.

Even though Teng Xiaoyu was injured, he still let the traitor go, because they had been teammates for years. The traitor was kicked off the team afterwards, but unfortunately they didn’t have solid proof to punish the mastermind.

Because of this, Teng Xiaoyu’s team was badly affected, but they didn’t give up training. Instead, they trained themselves even harder in order to get revenge for Teng Xiaoyu.

“Ningning, actually I need your help for another thing,” Tang Jiakai said a while later.

“What is it?” Gu Ning asked.

“We can’t swallow the anger and the humiliation. Can you help us teach them a lesson? We don’t want to be involved in big trouble, and I think that you can probably handle it well. If you think it’s too troublesome, you can say no,” Tang Jiakai said.

He turned to Gu Ning for help because he thought that Gu Ning was able to solve this problem.

“It’s easy, and I can help you.” Gu Ning agreed at once.

“Where are they training?” Gu Ning asked.

“All six teams are training in the Universiade Center, but every team has its own basketball room, and they’re in basketball room No. 3,” Tang Jiakai said.

There were 10 indoor basketball rooms in the Universiade Center, which were used for secret training.

“Do they train every day?” Gu Ning asked again.

“Yeah, they train every day from 9 am to 12 pm and 2 pm to 6 pm. They also dine in the dining hall inside it,” Tang Jiakai replied.

“Strangers aren’t allowed to enter the basketball rooms, so I’ll go to the Universiade Center during their break,” Gu Ning said. “I’ll try to have a game with them to teach them a lesson.”

“Do you want to play basketball with them?” Tang Jiakai was shocked.

“Why not? I’m strong and good at kung fu. It’s easy for me to play basketball. There is no way that they could grab the ball away from me!” Gu Ning laughed.

She planned to make them suffer some minor injuries.

“That’ll be great! Thank you so much for your help, Ningning,” Tang Jiakai said.

Teng Xiaoyu was in the hospital now, so they were going to visit him there. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Except for Teng Xiaoyu, there were eight men in the ward as well. They were members of the same basketball team.

There were 10 people in their team, and only nine were left now that the traitor was chased out. Because Teng Xiaoyu was injured, only eight of them could go on the court.

Five basketball players were enough in the competition, but some of them might be injured or break the rules during the fierce game, so they needed substitutes.

“Hi, Jiakai.”

“Hey, man!”

The second Tang Jiakai opened the door, they turned to look at him with one accord.

Tang Jiakai was Teng Xiaoyu’s close friend, so they hung out often.

“I-Is this Goddess Gu?”

When they saw Gu Ning behind Tang Jiakai, they were all surprised.

They recognized Gu Ning because Tang Jiakai frequently showed off his relationship with Gu Ning.
