Chapter 2044: Much Scarier than Situ

“Obviously, the force tried to stir things up between the Qing Gang and the Kirin Gang. It might seize the chance to replace us once both of us are injured.” Situ Ye said, “Although neither of us have fallen into the trap, it won’t stop trying since it’s aiming to ruin us. Whether it has the ability or not, we’ll certainly be affected once it acts, so we must do something.”

“Oh, so what do you plan to do, Situ?” asked Qi Tianlin.

“I have no idea yet. How about you, Qi?” said Situ Ye. He was lying because it would seem that he was trying to control Qi Tianlin if he proposed a plan.

Given Qi Tianlin’s character, he would be mad and refuse to work with Situ Ye, which wasn’t what he wanted. Anyway, he wouldn’t be embarrassed by denying it. It wasn’t a big deal to make a concession sometimes.

He was right. Upon hearing his reply, Qi Tianlin, who was a little annoyed, instantly felt more relaxed and began to seriously talk about it with Situ Ye.

The force had been hiding for a long time. Even though this time was just a test for the Qing Gang and the Kirin Gang, it must have some confidence since it dared to take action, so they wouldn’t be arrogant and think that they could do everything just because they had been the heads of illegal gangs for years.

On the contrary, they stayed alert every day to the possibility of danger not only from their enemies, but also from their own people. They were so busy that they wished they could have a few clones.

…

When the meal was finally over, it was already 1 pm.

Tang Haifeng and Tang Yunfan would go back that afternoon, so they went to their rooms for a rest first.

Gu Ning made full use of the time and went to see Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye. She called Chu Peihan out with her, then told Mu Ke and Yu Mixi to leave first. She wouldn’t be free to stay with them tonight.

Mu Ke and Yu Mixi didn’t mind, so they left earlier.

“Boss, you look so mysterious. Who are we going to see? Why did you bring only me?” asked Chu Peihan curiously. She had no idea that it had something to do with Chu Xuanfeng.

“We need to see a few people. I’m afraid that a fight is unavoidable. If it really happens, you can help me. Mu Ke and Mixi aren’t strong enough. They won’t be helpful. They could burden us,” said Gu Ning, seeming serious.

Knowing that, Chu Peihan stopped gossiping and became serious as well, as if they were going to have a fierce fight. Gu Ning was amused by her reaction, but didn’t explain further.

The clubhouse Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye were in wasn’t far away from the Huangdeng Hotel. It was only a street away, so Gu Ning and Chu Peihan arrived there on foot in about 10 minutes.

“It’s fine. Don’t be so serious!” Seeing Chu Peihan’s serious expression, Gu Ning felt a little guilty.

“How couldn’t I be serious? Boss, who are they? How come they dare to mess with you?” asked Chu Peihan in anger. She knew that Gu Ning had never caused trouble for other people on her own initiative; other people always started it. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Even if Gu Ning hurt someone first, she only aimed at bad people, so she actually helped people get rid of bad guys.

“They’re very special. I can’t tell you right now. You’ll know after we arrive,” said Gu Ning. She refused to tell Chu Peihan more details.

Chu Peihan stopped asking her.

Once they reached the clubhouse, Gu Ning called Chu Xuanfeng and told him to come down.

Before long, Chu Xuanfeng showed up.

Chu Peihan, who was quite nervous, thinking that a violent fight was going to happen in a while, was struck dumb in an instant, then realized what exactly was going on now.

Without thinking further about Chu Xuanfeng’s sudden appearance, Chu Peihan ran towards him with great excitement and gave him a big hug. “Xuanfeng, when did you come here? Why didn’t you tell me?” she asked.

“I wanted to surprise you.” Chu Xuanfeng stroked Chu Peihan’s head.

“Fine, I forgive you.” Chu Peihan didn’t blame Chu Xuanfeng for that. She was thrilled to see her older brother after all, so she wouldn’t be unhappy just because Chu Xuanfeng didn’t tell her earlier on.

“Alright, let’s go inside now,” said Chu Xuanfeng. Chu Peihan let him go, then turned to Gu Ning and complained. “Boss, I understand that you kept it a secret that my older brother came, but why did you lie to me and say that we’re going to have a serious fight? I stayed alert the entire time!”

Chu Peihan wasn’t really blaming Gu Ning for that though.

“I didn’t know what else I should say!” Gu Ning shrugged and said airily.

“Fine!” Because Chu Peihan didn’t really blame Gu Ning for it, she didn’t continue to talk about it.

After that, Chu Xuanfeng took Gu Ning and Chu Peihan inside.

“Xuanfeng, did you come alone?” asked Chu Peihan.

“No, my boss came too,” said Chu Xuanfeng.

“Situ is also here? I haven’t seen him for ages.” Chu Peihan was excited to hear that Situ Ye also came. Situ Ye was the man who she trusted the most and had the closest relationship with except for her biological older brother.

“Yeah, but the situation is a little special today. Stay quiet after you go into the room later,” said Chu Xuanfeng. Thinking of the atmosphere in the private room, Chu Xuanfeng gave a shiver.

“Why? Is Situ in a bad mood?” Chu Peihan asked nervously.

Situ Ye had never vented anger on her, but she felt uneasy when Situ Ye was in a bad mood and put on a cold face.

Gu Ning, however, knew the reason, so she asked, “Is everything fine between them?”

“Who?” Chu Peihan asked curiously.

“They just had an argument. Nothing else has happened, but the atmosphere in the room is quite tense. None of us can bear it,” said Chu Xuanfeng, then he turned to Chu Peihan. “The head of the Kirin Gang…”

“What?” Hearing that, Chu Peihan felt more nervous and tightened her body. After all, the head of the Kirin Gang was much scarier than Situ Ye.

“Don’t be nervous. Everything will be fine,” said Gu Ning to comfort Chu Peihan.

“It’s impossible for me not to be nervous. That man is much scarier than Situ. I’m not you,” said Chu Peihan.

Chu Peihan had to admit that she really admired Gu Ning’s bravery. There was no one Gu Ning was afraid of and Gu Ning was even able to make friends with them.

Gu Ning gave her a resigned smile, then said nothing. It was true that she was a very rare, brave person.
