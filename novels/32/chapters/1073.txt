Chapter 1074 His Energy Center Explodes.

The man was surprised by Gu Ning’s and Leng Shaoting’s ability.

“Who are you? What are you doing here?” he asked them in a low voice. He felt that they didn’t come here for treasure, but him. However, he couldn’t believe that ordinary human beings were able to find him, because even when he had to mingle with human beings, he wouldn’t expose his real identity.

“We came here for you,” Gu Ning said.

The man was struck dumb for a second. Since they came here for him, they must know who he was.

“What do you want to do after you find me?” he asked again. He thought it might have something to do with the Evil Practice.

He was right.

“I want to know more about the Evil Practice,” Gu Ning said.

“Why?” he asked.

“I just want to know more details. If you’re willing to tell me, I can let you stay alive, or you could be killed.” Gu Ning threatened him.

Actually, even if he told her everything, she wouldn’t set him free, because he was harmful to society. On the other hand, the man wouldn’t let her go even if she was willing to let him go, because she had magical power around her body, which was what he wanted most.

The man laughed with disdain hearing Gu Ning’s threat. “Seriously? Can you do that to me?”

Although he couldn’t win the fight against Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting now, he didn’t think they were better than him. They were human beings after all, and they would be short of strength if the fierce fight dragged on for longer.

“Do you know why I knew you’re here?” Gu Ning said.

The man was struck dumb again. Someone must have told them his location!

An idea dawned on the man, but he wasn’t sure it was the right answer.

“Why?” he asked Gu Ning.

“Another member of the Evil Practice told me,” Gu Ning said, and the man immediately knew that it must have been his enemy.

He was mad, but soon accepted it. They were enemies after all.

“How is he now?” he asked.

“He’s dead,” Gu Ning said.

“What?” The man was shocked.

“He’s dead?” He couldn’t believe his ears.

“Did you kill him?” he asked.

“Yeah, I did,” Gu Ning said. “So, will you tell me what I want to know or not?”

The man started to become afraid of Gu Ning now. Since Gu Ning could kill his enemy, it wouldn’t be hard for her to kill him.

However, he realized something important all of a sudden and sneered, “Do you think that I’ll believe your words? He must have told you something about the Evil Practice too before he was killed by you. I don’t think you’ll let me go even if I tell you what I know. Anyway, we’re not sure who will be the loser yet!”

The man doubted that Gu Ning was able to kill him. He thought that Gu Ning might be deceiving him.

“Well, if so, I have nothing else to talk to you about,” Gu Ning said, and decided not to waste time on arguing with him. Besides, Gu Ning didn’t think that he could tell her anything new. Therefore, Gu Ning added more magical power into her body and became much stronger in an instant.

It was impossible to catch the man without the help of her magical power.

Once Gu Ning got stronger, the man was unable to win the fight so he tried to escape a few times but was blocked by Gu Ning. He started to believe that Gu Ning did have the ability to kill him. However, even though he knew that Gu Ning could kill him, he still refused to give up because he understood that he would be killed in the end either way.

Leng Shaoting was curious about why Gu Ning suddenly became so strong, but he didn’t ask about it.

As time went by, the man soon ran out of strength and sank onto the ground.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were also exhausted. If they had met a member of the high level in the Evil Practice, they would have lost the fight.

At this moment, Gu Ning took out her gun and aimed at the man’s energy center in his belly.

The most vulnerable part of people who practiced inner discipline was the energy center where their energy was concentrated. Once the energy center broke, they died.

The man could barely move now, so he failed to avoid the bullet. The next second, the bullet pierced through his energy center, and it exploded with a loud sound.

“What...” Leng Shaoting was stunned.

Gu Ning explained at once. “The energy center is the most vulnerable part of his body. Once it breaks, he dies.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting nodded.
