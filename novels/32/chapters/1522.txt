“I’m also becoming friends with him for a reason, because I want to know more about cultivators. I think that I’m bound to go through many strange things, but I can’t avoid them. So instead, I must continue to improve myself,” Gu Ning said.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya always knew that Gu Ning was mysterious, but now they found that she was even more powerful than they thought. At this moment, they also realized that there could be more difficulties ahead of Gu Ning, but they were willing to stay by her side to protect her.

“If you run into some strange people like him again, stay away from them,” Gu Ning said.

Although Gu Ning often helped innocent people, she knew her own abilities very well. It wasn’t her duty to save everyone, and she wouldn’t do something which was out of her control.

“We understand,” Gao Yi and Qiao Ya said.

When they got back to Century City, they went back to their own homes. Because it was still early, Gu Ning took out her phone and began to chat with her friends in their WeChat group.

She didn’t have the idea to let the male ghost out right now, in case Baili Zongyang and Baili Zongxue found it. She planned to question the male ghost later when it was convenient for her to do so.

Chu Peihan and others just received their admission letters to their dream universities. So they were excited to study in their dream universities in a few months. If no accident happened, they could major in their favorite majors.

After chatting for a while with them, Gu Ning went to read her friends posts in WeChat Moments. Most people were fine, but Xu Qinyin seemed to be in a bad mood.

Gu Ning understood that she had worries. It was obvious that Xu Qinyin was seriously thinking about her relationship with Tang Qingyang, because Gu Anna left many comments to encourage her to be brave.

Gu Ning didn’t know what she could say at this time, so she left no comment.

Bai Xueyan also sent out a recent post, saying that she grew up a lot after being through something and she thanked those who had hurt her because they helped her grow strong.

Gu Ning took Bai Xueyan as her friend. Although they seldom contacted each other because she was too busy, she still cared about her. After reading Bai Xueyan’s post, Gu Ning was worried about her, so she sent her a message.

Gu Ning: How are you doing now?

Before long, Bai Xueyan replied to her.

Bai Xueyan: What a surprise that you would send me a message of your own accord.

Bai Xueyan: Not bad, not very good.

It meant that she wasn’t in a good condition.

Gu Ning: I just saw your post from yesterday, and I’m worried about you.

Bai Xueyan: Well, I just confessed my love to Allan yesterday, but he turned me down. I’m too young and not mature enough in his eyes.

Gu Ning understood that it was about Allan.

Gu Ning: It’s your own personal affair, so I don’t know what I should say, but it’s difficult falling in love with someone who loves you too.

Bai Xueyan: I know. I’m just a little sad.

After comforting Bai Xueyan for a while, Gu Ning began to read the recent news, especially news about her companies. Luckily, she didn’t see any terrible news, and most Internet users left positive comments on her companies.

Gu Ning also paid attention to news about Tang Xiaoxiao and other artists. Because of An Empress of Military Blood, they gained much publicity.

Artists needed publicity, or they would soon be forgotten by the audience. Some artists even did publicity stunts to attract people’s attention. Even if there was only bad news about them, it was better than being ignored. However, bad news always went abroad faster than good news.

Because too many onlookers loved gossiping, artists were under great pressure. There were rules in every industry, and they had to be mentally prepared for it.

Some artists might do anything in order to get fame, which meant money in the entertainment industry. They didn’t care whether people were complimenting or criticizing them, and only wanted attention.

In fact, only artists with outstanding skills could stay famous for long.

After a while, Leng Shaoting suddenly called Gu Ning. It was almost 12 am now, but he knew that Gu Ning normally went to sleep late. She wouldn’t sleep until it was past 12 am. Therefore, he wouldn’t interrupt her at this moment.

Gu Ning’s phone was in her hands, so she picked up his call right away.

Leng Shaoting was surprised and joked. “Are you waiting for my call?”

“I’m not, but my phone is in my hands now,” Gu Ning said. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Really?” Leng Shaoting smiled.
