2904 Run into Pythons

No matter what, they had to continue to bet on that since they were already here.

“Right.” Gu Ning said, “By now you should believe that we can do it.”

“Of course, of course.” Gano and Billy answered. Earlier they weren’t really able to believe Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning, but now, they were fully convinced.

However, they still had doubts and worries. They wondered whether there was really treasure on this island, or whether they could find the treasure.

If they found it, would Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting keep the treasure for themselves?

“How did you do it? It’s so unbelievable,” Billy asked curiously.

“It’s not really difficult. You only need to be brave and determined. As long as you are, you won’t lose your direction. Keep driving ahead, that way you can leave this place even if you can’t reach the island,” Gu Ning replied.

Hearing that, Gano and Billy nodded.

After the yacht stopped beside the island they got out.

“The fog is so thick. Can we really find the way back?” Billy asked worriedly.

“I believe Mr. Leng and Mrs. Leng can deal with it, right?” Gano turned to look at Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

“Sure.” Gu Ning said, “We can stop the yacht right here. Everything will be fine. My husband and I have a very good memory. We can remember every road we take. There is no need to worry that we’ll get lost. We might only take a bit longer on our way home.”

“Great!”

Gano and Billy were relieved.

Afterwards, they stepped onto the island.

This island was surrounded by thick fog, so ordinary people could never find the treasure even if there was really treasure.

However, it was different for Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. As long as there was treasure, they would find it.

They relied on Gu Ning’s Jade Eyes to search for it.

The treasure might be hidden in a part of the island, or at the bottom of the nearby sea, or in the middle of the island. Therefore, they needed to search from the side that they stopped the boat.

Gu Ning had ordered the flood dragon to check the bottom of the sea, so it swam over with them when they came and now it was looking around in the nearby sea to see what it could find.

Gano and Billy followed Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. They were completely under the leadership of Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting, because they had no idea what to do.

Therefore, they had to follow Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting closely otherwise they would be in a lot of danger if they got lost.

I don’t know what to do, but I don’t think it is a good idea for us to walk and look around like this,” Billy said. Even if there was treasure, it should be buried, so it was probably impossible for them to find the treasure like that.

If it was so easy to find the treasure, it would have been dug out earlier. After all, the rumor about the treasure had gone around for at least a hundred years. When their grandparents were young, they had heard about that.

“But what can we do to find it?” Gano asked. Although he knew it wasn’t a good idea, he had no idea how to search for the treasure.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting said nothing. They continued to walk and look for the treasure.

The island wasn’t large, but it still took them an hour to walk from one end to the other.

When they finished the third path, they encountered a giant python.

Gano and Billy were frightened the moment they saw the python. They immediately had goosebumps and felt very uncomfortable, but after Leng Shaoting punched it, the giant python immediately fell to the ground and it seemed to die, which shocked Gano.

He had heard about it from Tasha and Gu Ning had verified that they could kill pythons, but they were still surprised when they saw it with their own eyes.

It was totally different to really see it.

“Jesus, that’s so unbelievable.” Billy exclaimed.

“It’s indeed amazing.” Gano agreed. Although they could kill this giant python too, it would take him a couple of minutes, while Leng Shaoting killed it in a second.

After that, they continued to walk. Along the way, they came across many insects, snakes, and rats, but Leng Shaoting got rid of them with his magical energy, so Gano and Billy didn’t see them.

After walking forward for a while, they heard noises around. Something was slithering over.

Gu Ning immediately used her Jade Eyes to see it and saw a group of pythons coming towards them. There should be five pythons.

Honestly, even if there were fifty pythons, they wouldn’t be afraid, let alone five. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Wait here. I’ll be right back,” Leng Shaoting said, then he walked away.

“Where is he going?” Gano asked. He didn’t think Leng Shaoting was abandoning them, because Gu Ning stayed.

“There are noises. There should be pythons, and he’s going to deal with them,” Gu Ning replied.

Hearing that, both Gano and Billy were astonished. Pythons? Why didn’t they see them?

Anyway, Leng Shaoting was so strong that they believed that he could see what they couldn’t. It was normal, so they admired Gu Ning more than ever now.

Once Leng Shaoting met the group of pythons, he released his magical energy and killed all of them in a second, so before long, Leng Shaoting was back.

About an hour later, they finally reached the other end of the island. They had run into other snakes, rats, and insects, but Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting quickly got rid of them.

When they reached the other end, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting felt the flood dragon was floating at the surface. “Please wait here. I need to go there for a moment.”

Afterwards, she walked away.

Gano and Billy thought that Gu Ning was going to do something private, so they didn’t think much about it.

Gu Ning stopped after waking far away, then the flood dragon swam over. “Did you find the treasure?” asked Gu Ning.

“We’re not sure, but we saw a cave entrance under the side. We didn’t go in and came to see you first,” the female white flood dragon replied.

“Where is it?” Gu Ning asked. Although the flood dragon wasn’t sure of it yet, Gu Ning felt that it was highly likely to be it. She wondered whether there was really treasure.
