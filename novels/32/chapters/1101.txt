Chapter 1102 Have a Shower Together

“You know I like you!” Wu Mina said. It sounded as if Xu Jinchen had to take the responsibility for her as long as she liked him.Xu Jinchen said, “You also know that I don’t like you, right?”

“I...” Wu Mina was struck dumb for a second. She indeed knew that Xu Jinchen didn’t like her, but she was unwilling to give up. She couldn’t understand why Xu Jinchen didn’t like her.

“Why don’t you like me? Is there anything about me that isn’t good enough?” she asked.

In fact, since Zi Beiying claimed that she was Xu Jinchen’s girlfriend, she should compare herself with Zi Beiying.

Even though their family background was excluded, Wu Mina was still barely comparable to Zi Beiying.

Zi Beiying was obviously more beautiful and attractive than Wu Mina when it came to their faces and build, but Wu Mina refused to face this truth.

“Miss Wu, the fact that I don’t like you has nothing to do with your appearance or family background. I just don’t have feelings for you,” Xu Jinchen said and he lost patience.

Actually, as long as he liked a girl, he didn’t care whether she was beautiful or from a rich family. If he didn’t like a girl, he wouldn’t accept her no matter how outstanding she was.

Wu Mina didn’t know what to say now. She couldn’t force Xu Jinchen to like her after all. She had tried countless times, and didn’t have a good result.

“Miss Wu, please don’t bring it up again. I don’t want our families’ good relationship to be damaged because of it,” Xu Jinchen said. It was a gentle warning.

The Wu family needed the Xu family’s help in many aspects. If Wu Mina kept annoying him, he wouldn’t be kind to her anymore.

Although it sounded a little provocative, he had to do that in order to get rid of Wu Mina.

Wu Mina understood it very well, and felt scared. If anything bad happened to her family because of her, her parents would hate her. It wasn’t something she wanted.

“Sorry to keep you waiting. Let’s get inside now!” Xu Jinchen ignored Wu Mina and invited his friends to walk into the private room.

They went into the private room together.

Once the door was closed, Wu Mina couldn’t help but cry.

...

Zi Beiying removed her hand from Xu Jinchen’s arm after they walked into the private room, and she said, “The best way to deal with this kind of woman is to tell her that you already have a girlfriend. If she has any sense of shame, she’ll stay away from you. If not, I don’t know what to do either.”

When Zi Beiying separated herself from him, Xu Jinchen suddenly felt a little upset, which surprised him. Why would he feel upset?

Xu Jinchen panicked a little, but soon calmed himself down. “Miss Zi, thank you so much for helping me out.”

“It’s not a big deal. I don’t like that woman either,” Zi Beiying said, waving her hand.

After that, they were all seated and began to enjoy the meal.

A short while later, Gu Ning received a message from K. K told her that Dongfang Ziyu was staying in the Jinlin Hotel, which was owned by the Xu family.

Gu Ning told K to continue to keep a close eye on them tomorrow morning.

...

Wu Mina cried outside for a while, and her friend walked out to find her. “Mina, are you alright?” Her friend was nervous seeing her crying.

“I’m fine.” Wu Mina didn’t want to tell her friend what had just happened. “Give me my bag. I need to go home now.”

“Are you really fine?” Wu Mina’s friend was worried about her.

“I told you I’m fine!” Wu Mina raised her voice.

Her friend knew that she was in a terrible mood now, so she stopped asking her questions.

Wu Mina’s friend gave her bag to her, and she went back home alone.

...

When it was about 11:30 pm, Xu Jinchen and his friends went to have night snacks together.

Many of them had drunk alcohol, so they couldn’t drive. Luckily, Mengda and Nan didn’t drink at all, so they became the drivers.

There were nine of them in all, so two cars were enough.

Both Gu Ning and Zi Beiying wanted to have seafood, and the others agreed.

Leng Shaoting used to be allergic to seafood, but he was cured after taking Gu Ning’s power crystals.

In addition, seafood was expensive, and they didn’t want to miss the chance to have a free meal. Song Haoyu would pay the bill anyway.

Therefore, the group of them spent nearly twenty thousand yuan on seafood as night snacks.

It wasn’t much for rich people, but it was quite a lot for ordinary people.

After having night snacks, they went back to their homes.

Mengda drove Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning back to Leng Shaoting’s house, and Leng Shaoting booked rooms for Zi Beiying and the others in the Shengshi Hotel. Since it was Leng Shaoting’s arrangement, it was free.

Nan, at the same time, drove the rest of the people back home.

...

Once they were back in the house, Leng Shaoting couldn’t wait a second longer and pressed Gu Ning against the wall.

“You smell of alcohol. Go have a shower first.” Gu Ning pushed Leng Shaoting away.

“Let’s have a shower together.” Leng Shaotings stared at Gu Ning.

Gu Ning gave him a glare, but it actually wasn’t the first time that they had done that together, so she agreed in the end.

The two of them stayed in the bathroom for nearly an hour, and they did something more than showering inside.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
