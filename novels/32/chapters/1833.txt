Chapter 1834: Song Miaoge’s mother Is Injured

As soon as the statement was released, there were fewer Internet users who kept on attacking Kouzi.

Only a few people who had nothing to do claimed that it was just a show directed and acted by Kouzi itself. They believed it made so-called unqualified manufacturers the scapegoat.

Luckily, many Internet users disagreed on that, because most of them trusted Kouzi. After all, the great effects of Kouzi products had been proved by time. Moreover, the official Weibo of Kouzi also released solid evidence.

...

After the military training was over at 12, everyone walked toward the canteen. Many students around were discussing the Kouzi sunscreen incident.

Coincidentally, Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao were walking in front of Gu Ning.

“Many people kept saying that Kouzi sells fakes. Now, the truth proves that they’re wrong! I wonder whether those people will feel ashamed,” Song Miaoge said in an unkind tone. She said that to make fun of Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao along with other people.

When Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao heard Song Miaoge’s words, they knew that she was talking about them, so they were very angry. However, Song Miaoge didn’t mention their names. So they wouldn’t jump out to make a connection either.

After all, there were a lot of people who thought that the fake sunscreen was really produced by Kouzi.

Therefore, when other people heard Song Miaoge’s words, they all felt embarrassed.

After the meal, Gu Ning and her friends went to the small woods as usual to continue training, but Song Miaoge received a call at this moment.

Her younger brother called her and told her that their mother was injured when she tried to save an innocent person who was kidnapped. In the process she was injured and stabbed in the chest. She had already been sent to the military hospital.

Song Miaoge’s mother was a policewoman. Although she wasn’t a common policewoman, she had to do something when she encountered such a thing.

As soon as Song Miaoge heard the bad news, she was so frightened that she couldn’t stand. Fortunately, Gu Ning supported her right away, so she didn’t fall.

“We should go to the hospital right now,” Gu Ning said first without waiting for Song Miaoge to say anything, because both she and Baili Zongxue heard their conversation on the phone.

“Gu Ning.” Song Miaoge burst into tears, feeling helpless.

“Don’t worry, as long as your mother is still alive, I can promise that your mother will be fine,” Gu Ning said, looking at Song Miaoge with firm and confident eyes. Song Miaoge calmed down a little, because she trusted Gu Ning.

However, the little comfort didn’t make her feel much better, because she didn’t know her mother’s situation right now.

Without delay, they ran out of school.

Once they ran outside, Gu Ning met Rong Jue who was driving out of the parking lot when she was about to drive her car.

When Rong Jue saw that the three of them had the same anxious expression, especially Song Miaoge whose face was full of tears, he realized that something must be wrong, so he asked Gu Ning, “What happened? Where are you going?”

“Instructor Rong, Song Miaoge’s mother has been injured. We are going to the military hospital now,” Gu Ning said. Although they were in a hurry, they had time to reply.

“Get in, I’ll drive you there,” Rong Jue said once he heard that. At this time, he didn’t care about what he originally needed to do.

Gu Ning didn’t hesitate and pulled Song Miaoge to get into the car, because Gu Ning thought that it would take time to find her car in the parking lot. Although it might not be long, they had to make full use of every minute.

“Thank you, Instructor Rong. If it’s possible, please drive faster,” Gu Ning said.

Rong Jue didn’t reply, but he sped up.

Fortunately, it wasn’t rush hour, and there was only a little more traffic on some sections of the road. They spent slightly more time waiting for a few traffic lights to become green.

Anyway, it wasn’t a bad situation, because they didn’t wait too long.

Because the Capital University and the military hospital were in different districts, it took them more than half an hour to arrive even though Rong Jue drove very quickly.

Once they arrived at the hospital, they got out of the car and thanked Rong Jue, then immediately ran towards the operating room.

While in the car, Gu Ning had already asked Rong Jue for leave. In such a situation, Rong Jue instantly agreed.

Although Rong Jue sent them to the hospital, he didn’t follow them, because the Song family was not part of the Rong family’s faction, so he should not be involved in it.

Nevertheless, he still sent them to the hospital because of Gu Ning. If he only ran into Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue, he might not even bother to stop and ask them whether they needed help.

Without himself realizing it, Rong Jue paid more attention to Gu Ning.

Gu Ning and her friends directly went up to the operating room on the sixth floor. There were a few people standing outside.

An old couple, a young couple, and two teenagers about 14 years old all looked at the operating room with anxiety.

The old couple were Song Miaoge’s grandfather and grandmother, and the young couple were her uncle and aunt. One of the boys was Song Miaoge’s younger brother while the other was her cousin.

“Grandpa, grandma, how is my mother now?” Song Miaoge ran to the crowd, couldn’t help crying again, and asked anxiously.

Seeing Song Miaoge, they were surprised. Grandma Song asked, “Miaoge, why are you here? Aren’t you in military training?”

The second she finished that, one of the 14-five-year-old boys said, “I gave my sister a call.”

He was Song Miaoge’s younger brother, Song Zishuo. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“You...” Hearing that, everyone turned to look at Song Zishuo. Although they thought he shouldn’t have done that, they didn’t blame him.

Originally, they were unwilling to tell Song Miaoge because they didn’t want her to be worried, but they also knew that she should be aware of it since her mother was in danger now. Therefore, they didn’t blame Song Zishuo for calling Song Miaoge.

Master Song sighed and said, “Your mother was stabbed at the edge of the heart in order to save the other people’s lives. The doctor said the operation is dangerous.”

Song Miaoge cried harder after hearing that. Because she was so concerned about her mother’s injury, she forgot to introduce Gu Ning to her family.

Although Song Miaoge didn’t do the introduction, the Song family knew that they were Song Miaoge’s schoolmates.

Seeing that these two girls were so beautiful, the Song family was also amazed. Not only were they beautiful, but they also had an air of nobility. They couldn’t be ordinary girls!

Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue didn’t mind it when Song Miaoge forgot to introduce them to her family. Once they arrived, Gu Ning looked into the operation room with her Jade Eyes.

On the operation bed was Song Miaoge’s mother. Doctors were busy performing the operation, but it seemed that things were not going well.
