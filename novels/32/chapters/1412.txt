Chapter 1413: The Box

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Of course not, you can do whatever you want,” Mrs. Qin said.

With Mrs. Qin’s permission, Gu Ning directly damaged the lock with her hands, which shocked Mrs. Qin and Qin Yifan.

Once the box was open, the three gold bars were shown in their sight. Mrs. Qin was stunned for a moment, then said to Gu Ning, “Haozhi exchanged these three gold bars from his friend with money! It’s not a bribe.”

“Who did he exchange these from?” Gu Ning asked.

“Shen Guangli,” Mrs. Qin said.

“Did he come with this box along with the three gold bars?” Gu Ning continued.

“Yes.” Mrs. Qin nodded.

Knowing that, Gu Ning had an idea that Shen Guangli might not have a close relationship with Qin Haozhi, and the bribery scandal might have something to do with him. What was placed on the second layer of this box could have been done by Shen Guangli.

“Is there a problem with this box?” Qin Yifan frowned, looking at Gu Ning.

Mrs. Qin was scared, then focused on Gu Ning’s face. Although she also had the suspicion, she said nothing and waited for Gu Ning’s answer.

Gu Ning remained silent at first. She took the three gold bars out, then calmly checked the box as if she knew nothing about what else was inside. After that, she stopped all of a sudden and said, “The bottom of this box is too thick so I think it’s hollow inside.”

Hearing that, both Qin Yifan and Mrs. Qin got nervous.

“I need to pull this layer of wooden board out,” Gu Ning said to Mrs. Qin.

“Sure, I’ll get a knife for you.” Mrs. Qin left to get a knife without hesitation.

A short while later, she came back with a small knife, but her hand was trembling because she was too nervous.

Gu Ning took the knife and cut the box open.

Mrs. Qin and Qin Yifan fixed their eyes on the box. If there really was something inappropriate inside, Shen Guangli had to be guilty. At the same time, they had mixed emotions, because Shen Guangli was Qin Haozhi’s friend after all.

Besides, if Gu Ning hadn’t helped them discover it, their family would be in big trouble.

When Gu Ning removed the wooden board, what was placed on the second layer was exposed.

Mrs. Qin and Qin Yifan were astonished and didn’t know what to say now. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Gu Ning took them out and asked, “Did you recently buy a house for Qin Zixun?”

“No, we didn’t.” Mrs. Qin denied it at once.

“This is the ownership certificate for a house under Qin Zixun’s name, and his name is also on this check for two hundred thousand yuan,” Gu Ning said.

“H-How is it possible?” Mrs. Qin refused to believe it. “Haozhi would never accept a bribe, and Shen Guangli must be guilty!” Mrs. Qin naturally defended her husband. They had been married for years, and she knew her husband very well. However, even though they were a couple, it was still possible that her husband kept something secret from her.

“Gu Ning, I don’t believe my uncle would accept a bribe either, but we already found the evidence. I think we need to find out whether my uncle accepted the bribe on his own or if it’s a trap set by Shen Guangli,” Qin Yifan said.

“Don’t worry, I will,” Gu Ning said.

Actually, it seemed that Shen Guangli was very likely to be guilty.

“I need to keep this box and everything inside with me for the time being. If it’s really a trap laid by Shen Guangli, his next step will be to get the evidence back,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure, sure.” Mrs. Qin agreed at once.

Gu Ning already won her trust, and she relied on Gu Ning to overcome this crisis.

Afterwards, Gu Ning took photos of the ownership certificate, then sent the photos to K. She told K to find out how this ownership certificate was done. Qin Zixun wasn’t aware of it at all, so it must be illegal.

As long as this ownership certificate was absent from the Qin family’s house, the duty would fall on the land developer and the Administration of Housing.

“Oh, in case those who come to search for evidence are your enemies, I need to set a wireless pinhole camera in your bedroom and study,” Gu Ning said.

“No problem.” Mrs. Qin agreed.

“I’ll go buy it,” Qin Yifan said and walked out, but he was stopped by Gu Ning the moment he moved.

“No need, I have some with me,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, both Mrs. Qin and Qin Yifan were surprised. Although they didn’t understand why she carried wireless pinhole cameras with her, they didn’t ask further about it.

Gu Ning then took out two wireless pinhole cameras from her backpack. After that, she set one of them in the study and the other in the bedroom.

Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to scan around the bedroom and study to see whether there were any other strange things. Luckily, she found nothing.

Gu Ning told Mrs. Qin to put the safe away before they walked out.
