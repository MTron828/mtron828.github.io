Chapter 2532: Know More About Him

Not everyone was willing to tell other people about their difficulties, because it might bother their friends. In addition, friends could also laugh at you.

Well, that wouldn’t happen between Gu Ning and Chu Peihan.

Anyway, Chu Peihan was upset, but it wasn’t a big problem. Therefore, since it wasn’t serious, it was better if she faced it. No one could really help you, and friends couldn’t help you forever.

You could only grow up when you learned to deal with difficulties on your own. Whether you succeeded or failed, you could improve yourself by accepting challenges.

Alright, Chu Peihan didn’t have a serious problem right now!

“Um, I can tell you about it, but I don’t know how to put it. I’m in a total mess now,” said Chu Peihan. She was willing to share it with Gu Ning, but didn’t know how.

“Is it about a romantic relationship? Did you fall in love with someone? Doesn’t he like you? Are you sad because of that?” Gu Ning joked, not meaning it.

“Yes, it’s about a romantic relationship, but that’s not the case. A boy just confessed his affection for me, but I don’t know whether I like him as much as he likes me,” said Chu Peihan. She still didn’t have a clear idea now.

It wasn’t unwanted, but she felt very uncomfortable. She could not eat or sleep well. She said that she needed more time to get to know Han Chenglin better, but she couldn’t stop herself from thinking about it.

In fact, even Chu Peihan didn’t realize that she cared more about Han Chenglin than she thought.

Yesterday morning, Han Chenglin sent her a message of greeting, and asked her whether she had finished lunch and what she had at noon.

That night, he kept on chatting with her on WeChat, and said good night to her when it was late.

Even this morning, he sent her a message of greeting as usual.

Being cared for by someone made her feel as if life was really beautiful.

There were other boys who had chased Chu Peihan before and they had also done the same thing, but she only felt that they were annoying. Only when a boy she liked did that would she feel happy.

Upon hearing Chu Peihan’s answer, Gu Ning had a name in her mind, but she pretended that she knew nothing about it. “Is it Han Chenglin?” she asked.

“How could you know it?” Chu Peihan was shocked.

“I could see that he liked you long ago,” said Gu Ning.

“What?” Chu Peihan flushed. Unexpectedly, Gu Ning had already seen that Han Chenglin liked her, while she had no idea. She didn’t know until Han Chenglin told her.

“So what’s bothering you now?” Gu Ning asked.

“You know that we had an unpleasant first meeting, so I was mean to him for a long time. But afterwards I found out that he isn’t a bad guy and I changed my attitude towards him. Um, actually I never had special feelings for him. I didn’t know that he and Shi Xiaoyue are cousins until the day before yesterday. Then I learned that I didn’t meet him by accident, but because he bribed Shi Xiaoyue. When their family connection was exposed, he confessed his affection for me. He said that he did everything just to be close to me,” said Chu Peihan.

Gu Ning was also very surprised when she heard that Han Chenglin and Shi Xiaoyue were cousins, but she could see that Chu Peihan’s every meeting with Han Chenglin always had something to do with Shi Xiaoyue, so she wasn’t surprised that Shi Xiaoyue was bribed.

Even then Gu Ning didn’t think it was unacceptable that Han Chenglin and Shi Xiaoyue kept their family connection a secret from Chu Peihan. After all, they didn’t mean to hurt Chu Peihan.

“And?” Gu Ning asked.

“It’s such a big surprise to me. I didn’t know what to do, so I directly ran away,” said Chu Peihan.

“If so, you didn’t reject him either?” Gu Ning asked again.

“No, but I didn’t accept him,” said Chu Peihan.

“You didn’t reject or accept him, which means you’re impressed by him,” said Gu Ning. It couldn’t be more obvious. If Chu Peihan didn’t like him at all, Chu Peihan would have directly rejected him. She wouldn’t be bothered by it afterwards.

When Gu Ning pointed it out, Chu Peihan was embarrassed, but she decided to be honest with Gu Ning. “He’s indeed impressive, but I don’t think I’m in love with him. I hesitated, so I didn’t say yes. I don’t know. I have no idea what to do now.”

“I understand. You never had the idea of becoming his girlfriend, so you were surprised when he confessed his affection for you. You are not prepared for it, so you just need some time. Actually, I think Han Chenglin is a good boy. If you have a good impression of him, I think you can get to know more about him. You don’t need to rush. You can make the decision after being sure of your feelings for him,” said Gu Ning.

Gu Ning wasn’t telling Chu Peihan to stay in an ambiguous relationship with Han Chenglin, but it took time for people to get to know each other better. If they weren’t sure whether they really loved one another, it would be irresponsible if they rushed to get together.

Moreover, if a boy really liked a girl, he would be willing to wait. He wouldn’t think it was a waste of his time, and he wouldn’t easily give up. If he gave up right after trying once, it only proved that he didn’t like the girl very much.

“Yeah, that’s what I said to him,” said Chu Peihan. Although she was also worried that Han Chenglin might be disappointed, she had already made up her mind.

If he gave up just because he needed to wait for a while longer, it meant that he didn’t really like her.

Chu Peihan also wouldn’t keep Han Chenglin waiting for too long. She was reluctant to waste his time. If she still hesitated to be his girlfriend after spending more time with him, she would apologize to him, then leave him.

“Are you alright with Shi Xiaoyue?” asked Gu Ning.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
