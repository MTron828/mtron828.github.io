Chapter 2412: Have Met Somewhere Before

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Outside. Before Jing Yunyan felt the breath of cultivators in the plane, the old man sensed it. After all, the old man was at a high level. However, the old man only felt two cultivators in the plane. One was comparatively weak, while the other was a little stronger.

After they got in the plane and walked closer, they clearly sensed the second cultivator, but they couldn’t tell the cultivator’s level. In that case, the second cultivator must be at a high level.

They weren’t surprised to meet cultivators, because it happened. There were many cultivators moving around in the mortals’ world.

When Jing Yunyan walked towards Gu Ning, Gu Ning greeted him at once. “Hi, Mr. Jing, what a coincidence!”

Gu Ning said hi to him first simply because she wanted to stop him from looking for the cultivators after knowing that she was there.

It was uncomfortable to be stared at for long.

Jing Yunyao lowered her head, reading a book. Because an elder of the Jing family came with Jing Yunyan, she didn’t dare to raise her head in case she was recognized.

Hearing Gu Ning’s voice, Jing Yunyan immediately figured out who the cultivator was. At the same time, he was a little displeased, because he still felt humiliated after what had happened at the kung fu competition.

“Oh, hi, you’re Senior Shangguan’s female disciple.” Jing Yunyan replied, although he was in a bad mood.

While Gu Ning chatted with Jing Yunyan, the second elder of the Jing family, Jing Huaiyang, observed Jing Yunyao. He didn’t expect the cultivator at a high level to be a woman.

Besides, he somehow felt she looked slightly familiar, but he couldn’t remember when he had met her before.

Anyway, when Jing Yunyan spoke to Gu Ning, he learned about Gu Ning’s status.

Although he hadn’t met Shangguan Yang’s disciples before, he had heard that Shangguan Yang’s two disciples had won the first and second prize in the kung fu competition.

Since the girl was Shangguan Yang’s disciple, it wasn’t strange that she was at a high level. However, Jing Huaiyang was still curious about Jing Yunyao’s identity, so he asked, “May I know this lady’s name?”

“Oh, she’s junior to my master.” Gu Ning replied and Jing Yunyao said nothing.

“I see!” Jing Huaiyang said politely, then introduced himself. “Nice to meet you, I’m the second elder of the Jing family.”

“Nice to see you too, Elder Jing.” Jing Yunyao replied in a flat voice, but didn’t meet his eyes.

Jing Huaiyang was a little displeased, but said nothing.

Because of their way of greeting each other, they attracted attention from people around them. It was very strange in their opinion, so Jing Huaiyang stopped talking with Jing Yunyao and Gu Ning.

After saying good-bye to Jing Yunyao and Gu Ning, he went to his own seat.

When they walked by Leng Shaoting, they gave him a glance.

Leng Shaoting was also wearing a mask and a hat. Nobody could see his face, but Jing Yunyan recognized him. He knew it must be Qing Feng, because Leng Shaoting had the same level and air as Qing Feng and Shangguan Yang’s female disciple, Qing He, was here as well.

Jing Yunyan was jealous of Qing Feng, but he was scared of him too, so he didn’t dare to mess with him or greet him.

Jing Huaiyang could see that they were in the same circle and he also figured out who Leng Shaoting might be. so he didn’t bother to ask Jing Yunyan about it. If he asked about it, Leng Shaoting would hear it and it would be embarrassing.

…

At 11:20 am, the flight landed at the capital airport. Gu Ning, Jing Yunyao, and Leng Shaoting stood up and got out of the plane together.

After they got out of the plane and walked to the exit, Jing Huaiyang who followed behind them ran up and asked, “Qing He, is your master also in the capital?”

“Yes,” Gu Ning said.

“When Senior Shangguan visited the cultivation world last time, I missed the chance to see him. I always hoped that I could meet him one day, but I didn’t know where he was. Qing He, can you help me with that?” Jing Huaiyang asked.

Although Jing Yunyan had a conflict with Shangguan Yang’s disciples due to the kung fu competition and the Jing family had bias against Shangguan Yang’s disciples now, they didn’t hate them.

If it was possible for the Jing family to form a good relationship with Shangguan Yang, they would be more than happy to do so. Therefore, Jing Huaiyang had the idea to pay Shangguan Yang a visit.

“I’m sorry, my master is on retreat these days. He doesn’t want to see anyone.” Gu Ning declined. In fact, she didn’t want him to see Shangguan Yang. After all, the Jing family was the enemy of Jing Yunyao and Leng Shaoting.

Hearing that, Jing Huaiyang showed disappointment. Even if he doubted Gu Ning’s words, he couldn’t say anything about it.

“Oh, what a shame! Well, I hope I can have the chance in the future,” said Jing Huaiyang. Then he stopped bothering them and left.

When they were far apart, Jing Yunyan said angrily, “On retreat? I don’t believe it. She simply doesn’t want to help me!”

“Forget it, it’s not a big deal,” said Jing Huaiyang. Even though he was also unhappy about it, he didn’t think that he had the position to blame Gu Ning.

Compared with Jing Yunyan’s selfishness and rudeness, Jing Huaiyang had manners.

“If it hadn’t been for them, I would have won a prize in the kung fu competition,” said Jing Yunyan in annoyance. It had happened a long time ago, but he still felt mad whenever he thought about it.

“Don’t bring it up again. Don’t you feel humiliated? If you were better than them, they wouldn’t have ranked above you. I think you should go on retreat after you go back this time.” Jing Huaiyang criticized gently. Jing Yunyan was the son of the Jing family’s patriarch, so he couldn’t harshly criticize him.

Jing Yunyan understood it was the truth, but he was still angry. However, he said nothing further.

“I feel like the woman who is junior to Shangguan Yang looks a little familiar, but I didn’t see her face, so I don’t know who she is.” Jing Huaiyang couldn’t forget his meeting with Jing Yunyao, so he kept on wondering who she was.

“Perhaps you’ve met her somewhere before,” said Jing Yunyan. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Probably! Perhaps we know each other, and they put on a mask and a hat because we came. They didn’t want us to see their faces.” Jing Huaiyang guessed. Otherwise, why did they put on a mask and a hat?

It was also possible that they simply didn’t want other cultivators to know who they were when they sensed that there were cultivators coming.. If so, it was understandable.
