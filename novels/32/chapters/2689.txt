Chapter 2691: A Kid?

At that moment, Leng Shaoting and Xu Jinchen stood up from the side of the river and walked over.

Perhaps because there were many of them, the three men panicked a little because of a guilty conscience.

“This wild pig’s hair is black!” said a man, but he didn’t sound confident at all.

“Isn’t the hair of all wild pigs black? Have you ever seen other colors of it?” Gu Ning asked and felt amused.

If they were tough and insisted on saying that they had caught the wild pig before them and Leng Shaoting stole the wild pig, Gu Ning might really pay them for that! However, they lied, so they didn’t have much confidence and appeared weak.

“Right, have you ever seen red, white, or even blue wild pigs?” Leng Shaoxun joined them. He could also see the wild pig wasn’t theirs from their reaction.

It was not only Leng Shaoxun, the others had the same idea.

The man was struck dumb for a second, not knowing what to say.

“You don’t have evidence to prove this wild pig is yours. We can’t believe you,” said Gu Ning.

“It’s not important. This wild pig is ours! You stole it and even killed it. You must pay us for it. We don’t want much. You can give us a thousand yuan for it. We’ll leave after you pay us,” said a man.

“Right, pay us for it!” The other two men supported the first man.

At this time, Leng Shaoting said, “Since you insist on saying that this wild pig is yours, why didn’t you stop us when you saw us catching it earlier? You hid in the weeds and even talked about how to ask us for money afterwards.”

When Leng Shaoting went to catch the wild pig, he saw the three men hiding not far away. They were even talking about how to blackmail them.

......

“You…”

The three men were shocked. They didn’t expect Leng Shaoting to see them and even hear their conversation from such a distance.

Actually, there had been a distance between them so Xu Jinchen didn’t even notice them.

However, Leng Shaoting was a cultivator and he had sharp senses, so he noticed them.

The three men couldn’t believe it, but Leng Shaoting pointed it out, so they suddenly didn’t know what to do.

“Oh, it’s blackmail! How dare you do that to us?” Leng Shaoxun angrily snapped at them.

“Nonsense!” The man denied it at once. He wouldn’t admit it even though it was the truth.

“I can repeat your conversation word by word, and your behavior is typical blackmail, so…” said Leng Shaoting.

Upon hearing that, the three men were extremely frightened.

“Don’t scare us! We don’t want this wild pig now,” said a man, then directly turned around and ran away. Seeing that, the other two men also ran away quickly.

“They’re a bunch of cowards! It’s ridiculous that they tried to blackmail us,” said Leng Shaoxun disdainfully, watching their backs.

“Alright, let’s focus on what we are doing now,” said Gu Ning. She wasn’t affected by the three men. Anyway, they weren’t so easy to take advantage of.

The others agreed and continued to do what they were doing.

After cleaning out the wild rabbits and the wild pig, they put them on the fire. Gu Ning and Zi Beiying then handed the roasted fish to their friends.

Leng Shaoting used to be allergic to seafood and rarely ate fish, but he didn’t have that allergy anymore after becoming a cultivator, so he started eating fish.

“Wow, it tastes so good!” Xu Jinchen had a bite of the roasted fish. He thought it might not be very delicious because they cooked outside, but it was very tasty.

“Of course! We cooked it,” said Zi Beiying proudly. She fished the roasted fish.

Normally, Zi Beiying seldom cooked, so she wasn’t very good at it. After all, there was a cook at her home and she always dined at restaurants when she was outside. Mengda and Nan would also cook for her.

Only when she was alone at home would she cook by herself.

Therefore, Zi Beiying was very happy to hear that her roasted fish was delicious.

“Oh, it was done by you. No wonder it’s so tasty!” Xu Jinchen beamed with happiness.

He knew that Zi Beiying rarely cooked, so it wasn’t easy for her to make such delicious fish. The fish was well cooked and seasoned.

Even though Zi Beiying couldn’t cook, Xu Jinchen didn’t think it was a big deal. He married a wife, not a housemaid.

He was willing to cook for her if they lived together in the future. If she didn’t want to cook, they could hire a housemaid.

“Come on, stop showing off your affection publicly!” Leng Shaoxi said with mock disgust.

In fact, she was envious of the loving couple.

If she knew earlier, she would have called Gu Anna, who was also single, to come with her. She wouldn’t be so envious if she wasn’t the only single person here.

Although Leng Shaoxun was single too, he was just a kid in her eyes.

Leng Shaoming and Zhan Zhiyin weren’t boyfriend and girlfriend yet, but they seemed to be a couple. Leng Shaoming paid a lot of attention to Zhan Zhiyin and Zhan Zhiyin was only interested in him.

It hurt!

“Why? I think it’s beautiful,” said Leng Shaoxun. Because Leng Shaoxun was still young, he wasn’t very sensitive.

“You’re too young to understand,” said Leng Shaoxi in annoyance.

.

“I’m not a little kid. I’m an adult!” Leng Shaoxun argued angrily.

“You’re still too young even though you’re an adult,” said Leng Shaoxi. At least she thought of Leng Shaoxun as a kid.

“You…” Leng Shaoxun. “Then I think you’re too old!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Leng Shaoxun, do you want to fight?” Leng Shaoxi got mad at once and grabbed a stick from the ground. It seemed she was going to beat him.

The others watched them quietly, not saying anything because they weren’t being serious.

If they really got into a fight, it wouldn’t be too late to stop them.

Moreover, they were related by blood, so it was very normal for them to argue or fight.

“You said I’m a kid!” Leng Shaoxun argued.

“You’re a kid,” said Leng Shaoxi.

“Alright, stop arguing. I don’t want to fight with girls.” Leng Shaoxun was unwilling to argue with Leng Shaoxi. Although he was several years younger than her, he was a man and he knew how to be a gentleman.
