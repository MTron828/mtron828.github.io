Chapter 1939: Cut at the Throat

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting already knew what Charles Cretan looked like, so the moment he showed his face, they could recognize him instantly. However, it was already 10:00 am, but Charles Cretan was nowhere to be seen.

Was he not coming? Or was he just late? Maybe he was already here and resting somewhere else.

Regardless of whether Charles Cretan was coming, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting would keep hanging around here today and wait for him.

Before the race officially started, everyone went to place their bets.

A total of 108 people signed up for the race. They were split into 11 races. The first race consisted of ten cars while the last race consisted of eight.

The top three racers from every round would enter the next round to compete. After three rounds, the top three racers would emerge. As for the bets…

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting did not know about the prizes and did not place any bets. They were simply here for Charles Cretan.

Since the race was held on a mountain circuit, most people could only watch it from a huge screen at this square, the indoor main hall, or by booking a private room. Monitors were available indoors as well, but were only available at a cost.

People with high status preferred to watch in a private room while most people liked to join the crowd and watched it outside.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were unable to find Charles Cretan in the square, so they headed indoors to the ground floor. She used her Jade Eyes to check the private rooms in search of Charles Cretan.

A few minutes later, Gu Ning found Charles Cretan watching the match from a VIP room.

There were six men in the room with him. Two of them were Charles Cretan’s friends while the remaining four were bodyguards. Also, there were two more bodyguards guarding the private room entrance.

Gu Ning veered her eyes after locating Charles Cretan and said to Leng Shaoting, “Found them. They are in the private room on the third floor. There are seven of them in total. Two of them look like his friends while the remaining four are bodyguards. Also, two bodyguards are guarding the entrance.”

“Are there people in the private room next door?” asked Leng Shaoting. He was planning to get close up before attacking.

“All the private rooms on that floor are taken, but there are empty rooms downstairs. We have to find some way to get closer, charging in directly is out of the question,” said Gu Ning.

Leng Shaoting went quiet as he contemplated. In that case, things would get tricky, but they did not want to cause a major commotion.

“If we can’t come up with anything better, let’s continue observing them. I’m sure something will happen,” said Gu Ning before looking at Charles Cretan’s private room every now and then.

The crowd in the square was shouting in exhilaration.

After the first round was over, some of them felt jubilant while others were disappointed.

The second round did not commence immediately after the first round was done. Instead, it took 20 minutes before it started.

Gu Ning saw Charles Cretan getting up to walk out when the first race ended.

“He is coming out,” said Gu Ning. “In reality, we don’t have to worry about the commotion we make. We just have to kill him.”

“Okay,” agreed Leng Shaoting.

“If he comes out of the room, we will attack him,” said Gu Ning.

“Let me do the killing!” said Leng Shaoting. He did not want Gu Ning to get hurt.

“Sure,” agreed Gu Ning. “After we take down Charles Cretan, run into the mountains.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

They were surrounded by mountains, so it was easy to find a place to hide.

“Got it,” replied Leng Shaoting. “You go over first. I will come after you when I am done.”

“Sure,” replied Gu Ning before she headed into the mountain. Leng Shaoting was more than enough to handle Charles Cretan, so Gu Ning was not worried he might fail.

…

Charles Cretan went downstairs towards the main entrance after he left the private room.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting waited for him near the entrance and got ready to fight.

Leng Shaoting had no intention of using his gun. Instead, he chose to use a dagger. The gun he possessed belonged to the Zi clan, and he wanted to avoid getting the Zi clan connected to Charles Cretan’s death.

The Zi clan’s ammunition was available for sale throughout the world, so using their weapons did not necessarily link them to a crime. However, Charles Cretan had been making trouble for the Zi clan lately. So if anything befell Charles Cretan, the Zi clan would quickly fall under suspicion.

Although the main family was unaware of Charles Cretan’s attacks on the Zi clan, they would quickly know the truth when they investigated Charles Cretan’s death.

If they avoided connecting the Zi clan to the murder, the Cretan family would not think the Zi clan was behind it since the Cretan family had plenty of enemies. Many people wanted them dead and assassins were often sent after them.

The moment Charles Cretan came out, Leng Shaoting ran towards him.

Since he was a cultivator and a pretty powerful one at that, a mere mortal could not compare to Leng Shaoting’s speed.

Even though they were approximately ten meters apart, Leng Shaoting only needed a second to get to him, so Charles Cretan was completely caught by surprise. By the time he noticed the attacker, it was already too late.

Charles Cretan sensed a pain in his throat before he passed out completely.

Leng Shaoting not only cut Charles Cretan’s throat, he even used some magical power to be safe. Although Leng Shaoting did not cut him deeply, the dagger managed the slice halfway down his throat.

After Leng Shaoting cut Charles Cretan’s throat, he swiftly ran towards Gu Ning.

Everything happened so quickly that no one was able to wrap their minds around it. By the time they realized that their master was attacked, the culprit had already gone far.

Two bodyguards stayed to stand guard over Charles Cretan and promptly notified the family while the four remaining bodyguards gave chase.

However, how could they keep up with Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s speed? Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting quickly lost them after entering the forest. The bodyguards couldn’t find them.

The four bodyguards continued running after them even though they knew it was futile because they were simply too fast. If they did not attempt to run after them, it would be hard for them to answer to the Cretan family. They were Charles Cretan’s bodyguards, but they failed to protect him, so they were bound to end up punished.
