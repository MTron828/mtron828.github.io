Chapter 558 Tong Jiayao

However, just as they got out of the car, another car stopped right behind them. Coincidentally, Fang Xiaoke, who had approached Cao Wenxin for the purpose of marrying into a super-rich family, stepped out of the car. She was holding a middle-aged man’s arm and it was quite obvious that she was the man’s mistress. She really was a woman who was willing to sell both her body and soul for money!

When Fang Xiaoke saw Cao Wenxin, she was struck dumb for a second, then pretended that she didn’t know Cao Wenxin. To her surprise, she met Cao Wenxin here.

Cao Wenxin also didn’t want to pay attention to Fang Xiaoke, so she turned her eyes away too.

“Fang Xiaoke is really a gold-digger! My older brother stopped paying her bills, so she turned to an old man and became his mistress,” Cao Wenxin said when Fang Xiaoke and the man walked away. Cao Wenxin was extremely regretful that she had taken Fang Xiaoke as her friend before.

Before long, they arrived at the sports area.

“Welcome!” Once they entered the hall, waiters greeted them politely.

“May I ask which private room you are going to?” a waiter asked. All the private rooms were booked, so they had to be here to meet their friends.

“No. 888, my name’s Cao Wenxin,” Cao Wenxin said.

Even though they were here to meet their friends, the waiter had to check their information first.

“Please wait a moment,” the waiter said then took out a walkie-talkie speaking to the butler of private room No. 888. With the affirmative answer, the waiter guided them to private room No. 888 at once.

The private room was spacious, but there were only five people inside, so it looked empty to some extent. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

There were three women and two men in the room, but only one of the men and women were Cao Wenxin’s friends, while the rest were her friends’ friends. They weren’t strangers, but Cao Wenxin wasn’t familiar with them.

Cao Wenxin’s male friend’s father was also a leader in the military region and her female friend was from a super-rich family. The three of them grew up together but they went to different colleges. Now they had all graduated from their schools, so they came back to City B lately. The other three people in the room were all from either rich or powerful families.

Although Cao Wenxin didn’t make friends according to a person’s family background, it was an unavoidable trend that she would make friends with people from the same social class as her.

Cao Wenxin told her friends that she would be bringing two other friends and her friends all agreed. However, once Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting entered the room, the two attracted everyone’s attention. Especially Leng Shaoting, his appearance overshadowed every man’s existence in the private room.

A woman with short hair was excited when Leng Shaoting appeared in her sight, but she soon hid her excitement away. This woman was exactly the one who had encountered Leng Shaoting in the hall of Shengshi Group. Nevertheless, her secretary failed to find out about Leng Shaoting’s real identity which disappointed her, but to her surprise, she met Leng Shaoting again in the evening.

“Hi, Wenxin!” they greeted Cao Wenxin when she walked in.

Cao Wenxin guided Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting to sit on an empty sofa, then introduced them to her friends. “Let me introduce. They’re both my friends, Gu Ning, and Leng Shaoting.”

Gu Ning had reminded Cao Wenxin not to expose her relationship with the Tang Family, so Cao Wenxin introduced her as a friend. Although Gu Ning was Tang Haifeng’s biological daughter, it was still a secret, so it was better for them not to say it aloud now. In addition, they were just gathering for fun.

The woman with short hair repeated Leng Shaoting’s name in her heart a few times.

“Nice to meet you, Mr. Leng, Miss Gu!” they greeted them politely.

“Nice to meet you too!” Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting said.

After that, Cao Wenxin introduced her friends to Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. “This is Gao Chengyun and An Ran. We grew up together. And they’re Jiang Zezheng, Zhu Yuanzhen and Tong Jiayao.”

Tong Jiayao was precisely the woman with short hair.

“Oh, Mr. Leng, nice to meet you! What a coincidence! I just saw you at Shengshi Group today, and yet we are meeting each other again! Mr. Leng, maybe you didn’t notice me,” Tong Jiayao said to Leng Shaoting politely. She seemed very polite and kept an appropriate distance from Leng Shaoting.

“I didn’t,” Leng Shaoting said lightly which embarrassed Tong Jiayao. She didn’t expect that he would be so cold to her.

Although Tong Jiayao covered her feelings towards Leng Shaoting very well, Gu Ning still sensed that she was interested in Leng Shaoting. It was just Gu Ning’s instinct. As long as she stayed polite, Gu Ning wouldn’t jump to conclusions.

In the meantime, Gu Ning noticed that the woman wasn’t from a normal super-rich family.

The other people were also surprised by Leng Shaoting’s cold attitude, but they didn’t mind, because they had just met each other for the first time.

“Well-well, let’s have some drinks!” Gao Chengyun proposed to cheer everyone up.

There was no waiter in the room because they preferred to serve themselves.

“Gu Ning needs to drive the car, so she won’t drink,” Cao Wenxin said, then she turned to Leng Shaoting. “Shaoting, do you want to drink?”

Cao Wenxin was a little afraid of Leng Shaoting. Not because Leng Shaoting had a bad temper, but because he always stayed quiet and cold.

“No, thanks.” Leng Shaoting didn’t like drinking unless he had to or he was with his close friends.

“Since we’re here to have fun, it’ll be boring if we don’t drink together,” Jiang Zezheng said.

“Exactly! If you can’t drink we won’t force you, but if you can, why don’t you have some with us?” Gao Chengyun added. Normally, men gathered together to drink for fun, which was also a way to create a relaxed atmosphere. However, Gao Chengyun wasn’t criticizing Leng Shaoting but was just persuading him.
