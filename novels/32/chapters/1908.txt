Chapter 1909: A Selfish Girl

The other two girls who stood by Pan Tongyue’s sides also felt a little embarrassed, because they also believed Pan Tongyue was too self-centered. However, their families weren’t very rich, so they had to tolerate Pan Tongyue’s temper while trying to keep a good relationship with her. They were snobs, but they weren’t dumb.

After Song Miaoge argued with Pan Tongyue, Pan Tongyue shut her mouth, which made Song Miaoge and Zhang Zikai feel satisfied.

Afterwards, they went to the small woods.

“Pan Tongyue, are you ready?” asked Gu Ning.

“Of course,” said Pan Tongyue. Although Pan Tongyue had great confidence in herself, she didn’t dare to take Gu Ning lightly, so she looked very serious.

“Let’s begin then,” said Gu Ning. After that, the competition started.

Because it was only a competition for fun, Gu Ning didn’t use great force, but she didn’t give Pan Tongyue many chances to attack her. Within a second, she directly defeated Pan Tongyue.

Pan Tongyue and her friends were totally dumb struck.

Even Song Miaoge and Zhang Zikai felt surprised too. They knew that Gu Ning was very strong, and it couldn’t be easier for her to defeat Pan Tongyue, but unexpectedly Gu Ning defeated her in a second.

It was quite humiliating!

Pan Tongyue indeed felt very humiliated and instantly flushed red. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“I-I wasn’t prepared. Again!” Pan Tongyue was unwilling to accept the result, but she lost her confidence this time. It was hard for her to believe that Gu Ning was able to beat her in just a second. It must have been an coincidence, she thought to herself.

Song Miaoge and Zhang Zikai looked at Pan Tongyue with disdain. There was a huge gap between their levels of martial arts, but she refused to give in. Fine, since she wanted to humiliate herself, they would continue to enjoy watching the drama.

“Alright, I can give you another chance. Make sure you are prepared this time,” said Gu Ning.

She understood it was hard for Pan Tongyue to accept, so she didn’t mind giving her the second chance, because she knew the result would be the same.

After a deep breath, Pan Tongyue got prepared and fought against Gu Ning once more. However, this time, Pan Tongyue was still defeated by Gu Ning within a second. If Gu Ning were a boy, people might blame her for not taking care of the girl, but Gu Ning wasn’t a boy.

This time, Pan Tongyue couldn’t use the excuse that she wasn’t prepared again. She had to admit that Gu Ning was far stronger than her.

Why? Why was Gu Ning so strong? Pan Tongyue wasn’t weak at all. Nevertheless, she couldn’t fight against Gu Ning for a second longer, which was quite humiliating!

Pan Tongyue was willing to admit that Gu Ning was much stronger than her, but she was also mad at Gu Ning for embarrassing her in front of other people.

She was a typical selfish girl. It was she who challenged Gu Ning, but she still blamed Gu Ning after losing the game.

“Tongyue!”

Pan Tongyue’s two friends immediately helped her get back to her feet. Luckily, she was a kung fu lover, so it wasn’t very painful although she fell twice.

Gu Ning actually didn’t use much strength to hurt her, otherwise she would need to be sent to the hospital right now.

“Were you prepared this time?” asked Song Miaoge to mock Pan Tongyue.

“Of course she was prepared. Gu Ning didn’t move until she said yes,” said Zhang Zikai mockingly.

Their conversation made Pan Tongyue feel even more embarrassed, but she couldn’t deny it, so she had to leave in silence.

Her two friends also felt embarrassed because of Pan Tongyue’s failure.

“I thought she’s good, but it turns out I’m wrong,” watching Pan Tongyue’s disappearing back, Song Miaoge said with disdain. She knew it was because Gu Ning was too strong.

“That’s because Gu Ning is too strong,” said Zhang Zikai.

“I thought Gu Ning would torture her over time, but unexpectedly she beat her within only a second!”said Song Miaoge. Although it looked very cool, it would be more interesting if Gu Ning tortured Pan Tongyue.

“I don’t agree. I think it’s funnier to watch her beaten in a second. Didn’t you see that she was heavily hit by that?” said Zhang Zikai.

“You’re right.” Song Miaoge agreed.

In the afternoon, Gu Ning received a call from Nie Chenyang. He told her there would be a meeting for new members at 1 pm on Wednesday and he wanted to know whether she was free at that time.

Gu Ning said she would be free if no emergency came up. After all, it was three days later. No one knew what would happen, so Nie Chenyang didn’t say anything about it.

The Chamber of Commerce of the Capital University was very humane, and there was no mandatory attendance for the meeting.

...

Song Miaoge would have the competition against Ji Wenna at 8 pm on Wednesday night. The National Day holiday was right after Wednesday, so Gu Ning decided to fly back to City B then. She hadn’t been back there for a long time, so she thought she should go back during the vacation.

After that, she would also go to C City to check the condition of the Tianying Gang.

Although Huang Haihao reported everything to Gao Yi, Gu Ning was its real boss after all. She needed to see it in person. There were some things she had to see with her own eyes.

It was soon Wednesday. After having lunch at noon, Gu Ning ran into Yuan Shuyan. They didn’t argue with each other, but Gu Ning saw a touch of satisfaction in Yuan Shuyan’s eyes when she saw her. It seemed she had successfully done something.

Gu Ning didn’t know what Yuan Shuyan had done, but she had to be careful.

Afterwards, Gu Ning went to the meeting, while Song Miaoge continued to train with Baili Zongxue, followed by Zhang Zikai.

She was about to have the competition tonight, so she had to be well-prepared. Although Song Miaoge was confident, she was still nervous.

At 12:55 pm, Gu Ning arrived at the office of the Chamber of Commerce.

Because the Chamber of Commerce was very important for the Capital University, it was given a large office by the school.

The office of the Chamber of Commerce was a 50-square-meter meeting room, which was luxuriously decorated and carpeted. It didn’t look like a meeting room, but a leader’s lounge.

There was also a reference room, pantry, and washroom inside.

When Gu Ning showed up, all the members of the Chamber of Commerce were almost present, but there weren’t many of them. After a quick glance, Gu Ning saw 28.

After all, it wasn’t easy to be accepted by the Chamber of Commerce.

The Chamber of Commerce had more members than just 28, however, some were absent.

There were 5 new members this year. A lot more than 5 people had applied to join the Chamber of Commerce, but only 5 were qualified.
