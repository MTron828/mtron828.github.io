In Shangguan Yang’s eyes, delicious foods were more important than anything else.

“By the way, what’s your relationship?” Shangguan Yang asked again.

“We’re engaged,” Gu Ning said.

“Great, I think you two are a great match,” said Shangguan Yang.

“Thanks.” Gu Ning beamed.

All of a sudden, Shangguan Yang said in a low voice by Gu Ning’s ears, “He’s cold and doesn’t talk at all. Don’t you feel bored being with him?”

Although Shangguan Yang deliberately kept his voice low, Leng Shaoting was still able to hear him. However, he wasn’t mad, because he didn’t care about other people’s opinions. He only cared about Gu Ning’s feelings.

Gu Ning gave Leng Shaoting a glance, then smiled with happiness. “I don’t feel bored when I’m with him. Instead, I want to spend every second with him. He looks cold, but is actually quite warm and humorous on the inside. In addition, he’s the youngest major general in our country and has saved a lot of people’s lives.”

“A major general?” Shangguan Yang was surprised to know that.

“Very well!”

Shangguan Yang had a good impression of soldiers, because he knew that soldiers risked their lives to protect their country.

After knowing that, Shangguan Yang liked Leng Shaoting more.

Even though Leng Shaoting looked cold on the outside, he was a reliable and mature man. Some people might be fun and talkative, but they could be unreliable as well.

Shangguan Yang told Gu Ning to have a rest somewhere else, and that Leng Shaoting would stay in the tower with him on retreat for a few days.

Gu Ning wasn’t a cultivator, so she couldn’t go inside with them, and only needed to prepare foods for them in the following days.

Gu Ning agreed.

In order to improve himself, Leng Shaoting had to leave Gu Ning for a couple of days.

...

No one remembered that Qi Ziyue was abducted the next day, because nobody stood up for him and urged the police to find him.

Chen Yunlin heard the news the next morning, after a nurse who attended Qi Ziyue gave her a call.

Chen Yunlin was shocked the second she heard that Qi Ziyue was caught. She thought of her father at once, because it couldn’t be a coincidence.

Qi Ziyue had hidden himself well during the past few days, but he was caught right after she told her family that she was taking care of him.

If Qi Ziyue was really caught because of her father, Chen Yunlin wouldn’t be able to accept it. She knew that her father did it for their family’s safety, but Qi Ziyue could be in great danger now. Unfortunately, she didn’t have the ability to help him out at this moment.

Tang Bingsen didn’t go to see Qi Ziyue today, because it wasn’t the right time yet, but he heard that Qi Ziyue had an attack of his drug addiction late at night, which surprised him.

He didn’t know when Qi Ziyue became addicted to drugs, but he couldn’t care less about it. He only wanted Qi Ziyue to shut his mouth forever.

Tang Bingsen didn’t tell Ji Yijing and Tang Yaxin that he already caught Qi Ziyue in case they ruined his plan. He decided to deal with it on his own.

Most importantly, if “Tang Aining” found out that Qi Ziyue was in his hands now, “Tang Aining” would cause him more trouble.

He was still scared of “Tang Aining”.

When the sky just became dark, Tang Bingsen went to a house where Qi Ziyue was kept in a suburb. There was another man in the underground room in addition to Qi Ziyue.

This man was Tang Bingsen’s henchman, the deputy leader of his illegal support. Only a few people in the illegal gang were aware that Tang Bingsen was their real boss. In order to hide the secret, Tang Bingsen had a secret meeting with the deputy leader.

The fewer people who knew the secret, the safer Tang Bingsen was.

Actually, even though not many members of the illegal gang were aware of that secret, they all knew that their real boss was another man. Some senior managers thought that the man could be Tang Bingsen, because they had done a lot of bad deeds for him.

They did bad deeds for other people too as long as they were paid enough money, but Tang Bingsen was their major client.

Nobody dared to talk about Tang Bingsen in their gang, because their leader forbade them to do that.

It was also possible that Tang Bingsen simply had a good relationship with their leader. The capital wasn’t in the ambit of Tang Bingsen’s influence, and he only had a security company in the capital.

Normally, an illegal gang stayed away from major cities.
