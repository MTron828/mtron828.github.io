3087 Just a Bracelet

After that, Lin Xiayi asked the stand owner who had bought the bracelet. The stand owner was displeased, thinking why didn’t she buy the bracelet at the very beginning? Since she was willing to pay extra for the bracelet, she could have directly bought the bracelet from him. It would have saved a lot of effort.

However, the stand owner still told Lin Xiayi who bought the bracelet, because he didn’t want to mess with her.

Without delay, Lin Xiayi and Shao Yufan went in the direction that Lin Xiaoxia went earlier. As they walked, they searched for Leng Xiaoyao in the crowd.

Because Leng Xiaoyao kept on looking at the objects on the stands along the sides of the road, she didn’t walk fast. Therefore, Lin Xiayi and Shao Yufan found her a few minutes later. They were sure that she was the buyer.

Leng Xiaoyao directly put on the bracelet after buying it. She didn’t get rid of the evil power right away, because she planned to test Shen Xiyin with it.

Anyway, the evil power couldn’t hurt her.

“Miss, wait a second!” Shao Yufan shouted before he stood in front of Leng Xiaoyao.

However, the moment he saw her face, he was amazed by her beauty,

On the other hand, when Lin Xiayi saw Leng Xiaoyao, she felt jealous. Especially when she saw that Shao Yufan was surprised by Leng Xiaoyao’s beauty, she instantly became angry. She pulled Shao Yufan. “Brother Yufan, why are you staring at her like that?”

Saying that, Lin Xiayi gave Leng Xiaoyao a glare as if it was Leng Xiaoyao’s fault.

Lin Xiayi didn’t care about Shao Yufan’s face and directly said it publicly. Shao Yufan was embarrassed, but he wasn’t mad because he knew Lin Xiayi’s character very well.

“Miss, my friend likes this bracelet around your wrist very much. We stopped by the same stand earlier, but we needed more time to think about it. When we came back, it was already sold. Miss, can you sell it to us? I can pay you double,” Shao Yufan said politely.

“I’m not just your friend. I’m your fiancée!” As soon as Shao Yufan finished, Lin Xiayi argued in annoyance. She felt Shao Yufan might have interest in this girl, so he called her his friend.

Hearing Lin Xiayi’s words, Shao Yufan looked displeased, because Lin Xiayi wasn’t really his fiancée. That was just her own wish.

Actually, their families wanted them to be together. However, Shao Yufan didn’t want to be in a romantic relationship with Lin Xiayi even though they were childhood sweethearts. He only treated her as his younger sister.

However, it was unnecessary for him to explain that. After all, Leng Xiaoyao was merely a stranger.

“I’m sorry. I like this bracelet very much as well, so I don’t want to sell it,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She wasn’t mad about Lin Xiayi’s attitude, because they weren’t important.

Shao Yufan put on a resigned look after he was rejected, but he had no intention of forcing Leng Xiaoyao to sell the bracelet to him.

However, Lin Xiayi couldn’t accept it. She directly asked, “Do you think it’s too little if we give you an extra ten thousand yuan? Don’t be so greedy.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Xiayi!” Shao Yufan stopped her at once. No matter why Leng Xiaoyao refused to sell it to them, they had no right to blame her.

“Miss, I don’t lack money. If I don’t like it, I can give it to other people even if it’s worth thousands of yuan, but if I like it, I won’t give it to anyone even if it’s only worth a couple hundred yuan.” Leng Xiaoyao mocked. She didn’t understand why some people felt they were better than other people. Why did she think other people should give her whatever she wanted? Who did she think she was?

“You…” Lin Xiayi was mad. She wanted to say something again, but Shao Yufan stopped her. “Enough! Can’t you be quiet for a while?”

Afterwards, Shao Yufan apologized to Leng Xiaoyao. “I’m sorry. She’s a spoiled and immature kid.”

“I’m loved by my family too, but that doesn’t mean you can forget your manners. You might be a princess in your family, but you’re not outside,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She disliked Shao Yufan’s explanation, even though he wasn’t mean.

After that, Leng Xiaoyao turned around and walked away, leaving them behind.

Shao Yufan wasn’t mad when Leng Xiaoyao criticized him, because she was right and that was his thought too. However, due to their families’ good relationship, he couldn’t say it aloud.

“Brother Yufan, did you see…” Lin Xiayi couldn’t stand it and thought Leng Xiaoyao was too arrogant. She felt humiliated.

“Alright, she’s right. Do you think you can receive the same treatment outside? Other people are not obligated to please you.” Shao Yufan lost patience. He rarely criticized Lin Xiayi. Because Lin Xiayi liked him and often listened to him, she hadn’t done anything unacceptable yet.

“I…” Lin Xiayi wanted to defend herself, but she didn’t want Shao Yufan to be angry, so she gave in. If other people dared to say that to her, she wouldn’t stand it.

“It’s just a bracelet. If you like it, you can buy the same one. And these are all fake antiques. Aren’t you afraid other people will laugh at you for wearing a fake?” Shao Yufan said. He didn’t disdain Leng Xiaoyao, but he wanted to persuade Lin Xiayi to give up.

Hearing that, Lin Xiayi had to agree with Shao Yufan, so she gave up on the jade bracelet.

A while later, Leng Xiaoyao reached the raw jade material store where Shen Xiyin was.

Shen Xiyin had bought several raw jade materials, and they were being cut open.

When Leng Xiaoyao walked inside, she deliberately rolled up her sleeve to show the jade bracelet. She wanted Shen Xiyin to see it.

After Leng Xiaoyao walked inside, she didn’t walk to Shen Xiyin right away. Instead, she walked around first.

She knew a little about stone gambling, but was barely comparable to Gu Ning. She couldn’t see whether there was jade in the raw jade materials with only her eyes.

However, she could touch the stones one by one and feel whether there was jade with her magical senses.

It only took longer.

Anyway, since she was already here, she decided to try it. Perhaps she would have good luck today and could find jade!
