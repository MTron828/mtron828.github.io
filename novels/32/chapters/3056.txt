3057 You Don’t Know Her?

“I saw it. That girl named Leng Xiaoyao is indeed impressive,” Si Yiqi said. He had a better impression of Leng Xiaoyao now. However, because he was aware of her abilities, he was less surprised than his friends.

Although Li Mochen didn’t want to tell Mu Yiyang about it, Si Yiqi brought it up, so he couldn’t stop it.

“Do you know her? Leng Xiaoyao?” Mu Yiyang asked at once and showed excitement. It would be best if his friend knew her, so that he could find the girl.

He loved the name Leng Xiaoyao, because it sounded very powerful.

“Yeah. In fact, Mochen also knows her. And she has competed with Mochen in car racing. She’s really unbelievable,” Si Yiqi said, showing obvious admiration and appreciation.

Hearing that, Mu Yiyang abruptly turned to look at Li Mochen. He was annoyed and questioned Li Mochen. “Mochen, I just asked you who the girl is. Why did you say you don’t know her?”

Si Yiqi also stared at Li Mochen with an innocent look. Did he say something wrong?

At the same time, he was confused. Why did Li Mochen say he didn’t know Leng Xiaoyao? Did he not want Mu Yiyang to know about it?

In that case, he shouldn’t have said that!

Why didn’t Li Mochen stop him? Why did he let him finish?

All of a sudden, Si Yiqi couldn’t figure out Li Mochen’s intention.

“I didn’t want to tell you,” Li Mochen said.

“You…” Mu Yiyang was struck dumb for a second, and didn’t know what to say.

However, the next moment Mu Yiyang guessed. “Do you like her? So you don’t want me to find her and stop her from falling in love with me?”

Si Yiqi subconsciously had the same idea, but didn’t think it was possible.

Li Mochen gave Mu Yiyang a sideways glance. He didn’t feel guilty or mad. He only said in a flat tone, “Don’t think too much. She simply doesn’t want to be bothered.”

“Fine!” Mu Yiang stopped blaming Li Mochen for that. “But I still want to make friends with her. If you know her, can you ask her out?”

“She’s going to have the National College Entrance Examination, and is always busy with studying. She doesn’t have time to spend with you,” Li Mochen said. Even if Leng Xiaoyao had time, he wouldn’t ask her out.

If Mu Yiyang wanted to be friends with Leng Xiaoyao, he would have to do it on his own. Li Mochen refused to do the introduction.

“What? She’s a senior student in high school?” Mu Yiyang was surprised. Although he couldn’t see her age, he was still astonished after hearing that she was a senior student in high school.

“Fine, I can wait,” Mu Yiyang said. He didn’t want to waste Leng Xiaoyao’s precious time.

“Oh, Yiqi, you just said Leng Xiaoyao has competed with Mochen in car racing and fighting. What was the result?” Mu Yiyang asked curiously, but he didn’t think Leng Xiaoyao could be better than Li Mochen, because Li Mochen was extremely skilled in their eyes.

If Leng Xiaoyao could be as good as Li Mochen, she must be extraordinary. After all, she was young and a girl.

“They reached the ending point in the car racing at the same time. In fighting, Leng Xiaoyao was slightly worse than Mochen,” Si Yiqi said.

Mu Yoyang was stunned. “What? They reached the ending point in the car racing at the same time?”

Without hesitation, Mu Yoyang asked Li Mochen, “Mochen, did you do your best?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He couldn’t believe that Li Mochen had done his best.

Perhaps Li Mochen wasn’t the best racer, and there might be racers who were better than him, but Li Mochen was undoubtedly highly skilled.

“She’s indeed awesome. I did my best and drove at the fastest speed, but she almost overtook me. If we compete again, I’m not sure who will win,” Li Mochen said. He didn’t think it was embarrassing that Leng Xiaoyao was better than him.

Most men cared about their face the most, but Li Mochen chose to face reality. If Leng Xiaoyao was indeed better than him, he was willing to admit it.

“Jesus, is she a genius? She reached the ending point with Mochen in the car racing at the same time, and was slightly worse than Mochen in fighting. In that case, Yiqi and I can’t defeat her.” Mu Yiyang admired Leng Xiaoyao more than before.

He had seen many outstanding girls in car racing and fighting before, but they weren’t as all-rounded as Leng Xiaoyao. There was a huge gap.

Mu Yiyang didn’t know that Leng Xiaoyao was much better than he thought, otherwise he would be more shocked.

“Leng Xiaoyao has aroused my curiosity. If you don’t give me her phone number, I’ll find it by myself,” Mu Yiyang said. He was even more determined to meet Leng Xiaoyao.

Li Mochen said nothing. He wouldn’t give Mu Yiyang Leng Xiaoyao’s phone number. If Mu Yiyang wanted it, he could get it on his own.

After having the meal, they rested for a while, then went to the circuit.

Mu Yiyang loved car racing too, but didn’t dare to compete with Li Mochen. He only dared to compete with Si Yiqi.

Even when racing with Si Yiqi, he rarely won and lost most of the time.

However, there wasn’t a big difference between them. Therefore, he had the passion to compete with Si Yiqi, but had no intention of doing it with Li Mochen.

This time, Mu Yiyang competed with Si Yiqi, but was twenty seconds late at the ending point. It wasn’t the first time, but Mu Yiyang was still disappointed.

Si Yiqi comforted him. “It’s understandable that you can’t win. After all, you’re so busy. You don’t have time to drive a racing car. I have some time to do that, so I’m more familiar than you.”

“You’re right. I feel much better now,” Mu Yiyang said. In fact, he didn’t really care about that, and was just a little disappointed.

After hearing Si Yiqi’s words, he didn’t think it was a big deal.

“Come on, we can have a fighting competition. I don’t think you can defeat me this time,” Mu Yiyang said proudly.

“You’re a major. You’re either training or doing tasks every day. I’m obviously not your match, but I want to see how much progress you’ve made. Are you much better than me now?” Si Yiqi said. Even if he knew he couldn’t defeat Mu Yiyang, he was still interested.
