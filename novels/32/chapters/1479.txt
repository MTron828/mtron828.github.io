Chapter 1480: Edited Photos?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“How is it possible? Don’t you know what you’ve done yourself?” Tang Bingsen questioned Tang Yaxin in anger.

Qi Ziyue was also angry now, but he wasn’t in the position to criticize Tang Yaxin, because he wasn’t a loyal partner either. He should blame the woman who caused this big trouble for it!

Qi Ziyue turned to glare at Gu Ning and couldn’t wait to beat her, but he didn’t dare to do that, because he knew that he was too weak in front of her. No matter how unwilling he was to accept it, he could do nothing about it.

Gu Ning enjoyed it when she saw him clenching his teeth glaring at her but could do nothing at all.

Tang Yaxin, however, couldn’t stay as calm as Qi Ziyue. She hated Gu Ning to death at this moment. If Gu Ning didn’t throw those nude pictures to the guests, she could keep her dirty secret from other people forever.

Thinking of that, Tang Yaxin abruptly pushed Ji Yijing away and ran to Gu Ning. “I’ll kill you!” However, Tang Yaxin was wearing a long and heavy wedding gown, so she stumbled and fell on the ground after running for just a few steps. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Ha-ha, ha-ha.” Some people burst into laughter, because it was ridiculously funny, but they shut their mouths the next second in case the Tang family was annoyed.

Most of the present guests had a close relationship with the Tang family in business or politics, so they were unwilling to offend them.

Although some guests wanted to leave now because it was super embarrassing and they didn’t want to see the drama any longer, they couldn’t think of a good excuse to tell Tang Bingsen. As a result, they had to stand there and hoped that the wedding could end as soon as possible.

“Yaxin!” Ji Yijing was frightened and went to help Tang Yaxin get back on her feet, then she questioned Gu Ning. “What the hell do you want to do?”

“I am doing what I want to do right now.” Gu Ning calmly smiled at Ji Yijing. Actually, there was more Gu Ning wanted to do today, and it was just the beginning now.

“You...” Ji Yijing was furious, but didn’t know what to say now. This woman ruined her daughter’s wedding and future.

It was impossible for Tang Yaxin to live a normal life from now on. She knew that this woman did it because of Tang Aining, but she didn’t understand why this woman had to do that since Tang Aining was already dead.

In fact, although Tang Aining was dead, her soul wasn’t. They had caused Tang Aining’s death, so they should pay for it.

Tang Yaxin was reluctant to accept the result, and suddenly had an idea. “Those photos aren’t real. They’re edited, and I’ve never done something like that before!”

Hearing that, some believed it, while some still had doubt. It wasn’t uncommon that some people used edited photos to scheme against their enemies. Most importantly, not everyone at the wedding was able to see the nude pictures.

“Right, they’re edited! They’re definitely edited. She’s an evil woman and she did that on purpose to frame Yaxin!” Ji Yijing defended Tang Yaxin at once.

As long as everyone believed that those photos were edited, Tang Yaxin would be safe. However, Ji Yijing would only be disappointed.

“Edited? Tang Yaxin, you don’t have the chance to see the photos yet, but you’re quite eager to deny them. Do you feel guilty now? Are you in a panic at this moment?” Gu Ning smiled. “By the way, I also have videos in my hands. If you don’t mind, I can play a video right now in front of everyone.”

There was a whole set of projection equipment at the wedding, which was used to project the wedding pictures of the bride and the bridegroom.

Gu Ning used to have the idea to directly play the video at the wedding, but it wasn’t easy, because it could be stopped at any second. Therefore, Gu Ning used pictures instead, which was much more convenient.

The reality proved that pictures were indeed very convenient.

“You...” Tang Yaxin was stunned. She had no idea what to do now.

At this time, a reporter asked Gu Ning, “Miss Tang, since you told us that you’re the older daughter of the Tang family, why do you want to embarrass the Tang family at Tang Yaxin’s wedding?”

It was obvious that they didn’t get along with each other at all.

“Because...” Gu Ning pulled her lips, but Tang Bingsen interrupted her when she was about to say another word. “Alright, it’s enough today. Please give us some time and space to deal with our family affair. We’ll have a party another day.”

Tang Bingsen wouldn’t allow Gu Ning to badly humiliate his family again.

After that, Tang Bingsen told his secretary and other staff to walk his guests out.

Since Tang Bingsen said that, the guests had to leave.

Some of them couldn’t wait to leave the wedding, and they didn’t hesitate to walk out once Tang Bingsen said that. Although some still wanted to stay to watch the drama, they had to leave for the sake of Tang Bingsen.

Gu Ning didn’t bother to stop them this time, but she took out a loudspeaker and played a voice recording.

“Even if I’m married, we can still be together, but we can’t meet often...”
