Chapter 1828: I won’t Let You Lose

Ji Wenna furious, but Song Miaoge was pleased to see that.

“Fine!” Ji Wenna didn’t want this dress anymore, so she rushed into the fitting room and took it off.

Ji Wenna didn’t know that Gufan was owned by Gu Ning. Although she no longer wanted this dress, she could still choose another one. She wouldn’t stop shopping for beautiful clothes just because of Song Miaoge.

After Ji Wenna came out, she gave Song Miaoge a glare without saying anything, then went on to choose her clothes.

In a while, Ji Wenna found a dress to try on, which was the last one in the store.

Gu Ning immediately went to find one that was not much different, and also tried it on.

When they showed up again, Ji Wenna was still overshadowed by Gu Ning. Ji Wenna was so angry that she was about to lose her temper. She realized that they were going to behave like this against her till the end.

“What do you mean by doing this?” Ji Wenna directly questioned Gu Ning. Looking at Gu Ning’s face that was much prettier than hers, she was jealous and couldn’t help but want to ruin it.

“It’s none of your business! We’re just trying on clothes. We aren’t standing in your way. How dare you question me like that!” Gu Ning looked at her coldly and argued.

“You...” Ji Wenna didn’t know what to say.

They didn’t stand in her way, so she shouldn’t question Gu Ning. However, they wouldn’t stop behaving against her! She had to give up buying the clothes she liked in the end.

As a result, Ji Wenna simply stopped looking at new clothes, and went straight into the fitting room. She changed her clothes, and left without hesitation.

As she walked out, Ji Wenna glared at Song Miaoge and sneered, “Song Miaoge, let’s wait and see! In a month, I will ruin you.”

After that, she left.

At the same time, Song Miaoge was annoyed too. Although Gu Ning helped her humiliate Ji Wenna just now, she felt temporarily relieved, but she still felt uneasy thinking about what could happen a month later.

“Don’t worry, I can help you improve your fighting skills. I won’t let you lose.” Gu Ning immediately comforted her, but what she said was true.

“Really?” Song Miaoge smiled upon hearing this, and asked.

“The medicine I gave you can improve your physical fitness, then I will train you for the next few days,” Gu Ning said.

“Great,” Song Miaoge trusted Gu Ning, and her anxiety disappeared. She was soon in the mood to continue to look at the clothes.

The saleswoman who served Ji Wenna saw that the commission she was about to get had flown away because of Gu Ning. Although she was unhappy with it, she didn’t dare to complain about it.

Gu Ning noticed her reaction, so she directly told the saleswoman to serve Song Miaoge instead.

When they came just now, a saleswoman wanted to serve them, but Gu Ning declined.

Because there were a lot of customers in the store, she told them to serve other customers. Song Miaoge was her friend anyway, so she could serve her in person. Accordingly, Song Miaoge didn’t have a saleswoman to serve her.

Hearing Gu Ning’s order, the saleswoman was cheered up and hurried to serve Song Miaoge.

In the end, Song Miaoge bought a dress, a jacket, a pair of pants, and a pair of shoes.

Baili Zongxue also bought a dress, a jacket, a pair of pants, and a pair of shoes.

Gu Ning directly gave them a 30% discount. Even the high-end VIP card in the store could only provide a 20% discount.

Although the clothes in Gufan weren’t cheap, both Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue were rich kids, so they didn’t care. The monthly allowance given by their family was far more than several hundred or thousand, and was even over a hundred thousand yuan. They could also ask for more money after spending it.

Their families gave them so much money, because they understood and believed that they wouldn’t spend money indiscriminately.

As long as it was used where it should be used, it didn’t matter if the money was a lot or a little.

After buying the clothes, they walked towards the “Cozy Beauty Shop”.

On their way out, Gu Ning asked Song Miaoge, “Miaoge, what’s the grudge with you and Ji Wenna? If you’re willing to tell us, just say it. If not, I won’t force you.”

“It’s not something I can’t say. Ji Wenna and I grew up in the same compound. Her father and my father are both soldiers, but they aren’t in the same military camp. We never got along ever since we were little, and we fought often. Because we were raised in a military camp, we’ve learned many fighting skills. Every time we meet, we argue with each other. Six months ago, we had a fight and I lost. However, I was unwilling to accept the result, so I promised to defeat her in half a year. Ji Wenna said that it was meaningless to win, and she put forward a bet. Whoever loses must wear a bikini and pole dance. It’ll be recorded as a video and be uploaded to the Internet by the winner. For families like ours, we care about our reputation a lot. If something like that happens, the loser and her family will both be humiliated. I agreed in anger at that time. We even signed an agreement on paper. Therefore, no one can deny it. I’ve been training for the past few months after the college entrance examination. Although I have improved a lot, Ji Wenna is also training, so I don’t have much confidence,” Song Miaoge said. Even though Gu Ning said that she would help her, she was still upset upon thinking of that.

“When you had the fight last time, how much were her skills better than yours?” Gu Ning asked.

“Not much better than me!” Song Miaoge said.

“Then it won’t be a problem,” Gu Ning said. Although she didn’t know Song Miaoge’s level, it should be easy for her to help Song Miaoge surpass Ji Wenna in a month. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“When we return to our school in the afternoon, I’ll test your level first. Don’t worry, my friends have improved a lot within a short time after my training,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure.” With Gu Ning’s help, Song Miaoge felt much more at ease.

When Gu Ning and her two friends arrived at Kouzi, there were a lot of people in the shop, and it was a bit crowded. Moreover, there were always queues for payment at the counter. More than a dozen were still standing in line!

“Jesus! It’s so popular!”

“Right, I don’t think other skincare shops have half of the customers in Kouzi!”

Witnessing the scene, both Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue couldn’t help exclaiming.

It was true that other skincare shops didn’t have half of the customers in Kouzi. Because of that, all the sales women in other cosmetics stores felt quite upset. If there were many customers, it meant that the sales woman could have a higher commission. If not, they might have no commission at all! However, they could do nothing about it.

Actually, they were secretly using the skin care products and cosmetics from Kouzi. They had to admit that they were really effective.

If it was owned by another boss, the prices must be much higher.
