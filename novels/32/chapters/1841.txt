Chapter 1842: Sure, I’ll Smile More Often in the Future

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Moreover, Shangguan Yang and the others knew that Leng Shaoting came out to welcome Gu Ning, so they wouldn’t bother them. Therefore, Leng Shaoting refused to let go of Gu Ning, but directly kissed her.

“What...”

Gu Ning was startled. Even if no one would come in here and Shangguan Yang and the others would not come out all of a sudden, they were in public after all! What if someone saw them? It would be quite embarrassing.

Gu Ning didn’t resist, but she still pushed Leng Shaoting away after a minute, glaring at him. “Alright, what if someone sees us?”

Leng Shaoting looked at Gu Ning with dissatisfaction, but Gu Ning was afraid, so he didn’t continue, otherwise Gu Ning couldn’t successfully push him away!

“We can drive mother back to Mountain River Garden after having the meal together, then you must stay with me for the whole afternoon,” Leng Shaoting said. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Sure,” Gu Ning replied with a smile. She hadn’t been alone with Leng Shaoting for a long time, and naturally wanted to be alone with him for a while.

Then Leng Shaoting closed the car door for Gu Ning, and walked into the house holding her hand.

“By the way, how’s your cultivation?” Gu Ning asked. Although she could feel that Leng Shaoting was much stronger than before, Gu Ning wasn’t a cultivator after all, so she didn’t know his level as a cultivator right now. She could only feel whether he was strong or weak.

“The peak of the Golden Core Stage of turning qi into energy,” Leng Shaoting said as his eyes flashed with fear that Gu Ning couldn’t see, because the advancement this time was very dangerous. He could have lost his life, if it hadn’t been for Shangguan Yang’s great medicines.

“What? You’ve made quick progress! That’s great.” Gu Ning was very surprised, excited and happy.

She had witnessed Leng Shaoting’s unbelievable talent because he directly made it to the Heartbeat Stage as a beginner, but it was getting harder and harder to advance. To her surprise, Leng Shaoting was able to go from the Heartbeat Stage to the Golden Core Stage in just seven days. It was incredible, because he was the first cultivator who had made such rapid progress in history.

Although for the entire level system of cultivators, the period of turning qi into energy was only a medium level, while Golden Core Stage was the middle stage of turning qi into energy.

Jing Jining once said that in the current cultivation world, cultivators who were in the Golden Core Stage were already considered masters, because now masters with the highest level in the cultivation world were only in the Out-of-body Stage, and there were only two of them.

The Out-of-body Stage was two levels higher than the Golden Core Stage, but there was a huge difference. Even 10 cultivators in Golden Core Stage might not be a match for one cultivator in the Out-of-body Stage.

Moreover, there were only a dozen masters in the Yuan Ying Stage, which was a level higher than the Golden Core Stage, in the cultivation world. Therefore, cultivators in the Golden Core Stage were considered masters in today’s cultivation world, and they were quite rare.

There were only a few dozen cultivators in the Golden Core Stage.

It was all because the magical power and magical pills were getting fewer and fewer, so cultivation became harder and harder. In that case, it was already pretty hard to be able to reach the Golden Core Stage.

The Golden Core Stage of turning qi into energy was the stable stage after the Heartbeat Stage, which was the final stage of true cultivation. Before the Golden Core Stage, cultivators could only use magical energy to attack other people, or simply manipulate the surrounding items to fight, fly over the wall. However, in the Golden Core Stage, their skills would be greatly improved. They would be able to fly with a sword and stay young forever.

They needed to obtain magical weapons first to be able to fly with them, and also depended on their own talent.

Even though they were able to stay young forever, it didn’t mean that they would always look the same. In fact, Leng Shaoting’s face might not change a lot after dozens of years.

In the past, Gu Ning would definitely feel sad again upon thinking of that, because there was a huge difference between her and Leng Shaoting. However, everything changed now. It became easier for her to be a cultivator than before and she believed that she could succeed one day, so she wouldn’t worry and feel sad anymore.

With Gu Ning’s praise, Leng Shaoting couldn’t help but smile happily.

“Oh, Are you able to fly with a sword now?” Gu Ning asked looking at Leng Shaoting, but she saw the smile on his face all of a sudden. Although it was a faint smile, Gu Ning was still stunned.

“I just learned it. I can only fly for a few minutes, and I can’t fly too high,” Leng Shaoting said. Seeing Gu Ning stunned by his smile, Leng Shaoting grinned.

“Shaoting, you should smile more often. You look stunning with a smile!” Gu Ning said, completely mesmerized by his smile.

“Sure, I’ll smile more often in the future,” Leng Shaoting replied. He was willing to do whatever Gu Ning liked.

“Great.” Gu Ning was satisfied. No one was willing to see a cold face if there was a smiling face. Most importantly, she hoped that Leng Shaoting could be happy, because she would be happy when he was happy.

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning went to the dining hall, then enjoyed the meal together.

Jing Yunyao learned that Leng Shaoting had a flood dragon with him after he went to Kunlun Mountain.

As a cultivator, she wasn’t surprised at all, but she didn’t expect that the flood dragon actually belonged to Gu Ning.

After all, Gu Ning wasn’t a cultivator, but she was able to tame such a fierce creature, which showed that she must be more powerful than Jing Yunyao thought.

Knowing that Gu Ning gave Leng Shaoting the flood dragon because she hoped Leng Shaoting could have a helper when he was in danger, Jing Yunyao was moved and felt grateful to Gu Ning.

The better Gu Ning treated her and Leng Shaoting, the more she felt that she owed Gu Ning. Therefore, she always reminded herself to treat Gu Ning well too and to protect her from danger.

Since Jing Yunyao found out about the flood dragon, she also learned that Gu Ning had a telepathic eye space with her. However, Leng Shaoting didn’t tell her any details, so Jing Yunyao didn’t ask about it.

During the meal, Jing Yunyao kept giving Gu Ning the dishes that she liked to eat.

Although Gu Ning wasn’t picky, she had her favorites, such as shrimps and crabs.

After their trip to Kunlun Mountain, although Jing Yunyao’s cultivation hadn’t improved much, she had made great progress. The most important thing was that Jing Yunyao had regained her memories.

It was a wonderful thing for Jing Yunyao to regain her memories, but there were also some bad memories that had affected her mood. Luckily, she had already gotten over them.

Once they finished the meal, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning drove Jing Yunyao back to Mountain River Garden.

Afterwards, Leng Shaoting left with Gu Ning.

“Where are we going now?” Gu Ning asked.

“You’ll know soon,” Leng Shaoting said and kept it a secret.

“Great!”

Since he said that, Gu Ning didn’t ask further.

Leng Shaoting brought Gu Ning to a villa. Gu Ning looked at Leng Shaoting with confusion, so Leng Shaoting explained it at once.. “I feel a little tired after cultivating for a week, so let’s take a nap first before we hang out.”
