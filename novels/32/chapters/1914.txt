Chapter 1915: Have Been Ambushed Many Times

If Ji Wenna wanted to cause her trouble, Gu Ning wouldn’t avoid it either.

Once Gu Ning and her friends were gone, Ji Wenna ran to change out of the bikini. It was quite humiliating for her to wear it.

Ji Wenna was full of hatred now and couldn’t wait to kill Gu Ning, but she didn’t have the ability for now. Anyway, she wouldn’t let them go, never ever.

“Gu Ning, do you think Ji Wenna was scared by our threat?” Song Miaoge asked worriedly when they were out of the martial arts hall.

Although she won this time and felt relieved, she was still worried.

“I don’t think so, but she’ll be quiet for a while. You must be careful from now on. Don’t be alone outside,” said Gu Ning. She wasn’t worried about Baili Zongxue at all, but was afraid that Song Miaoge and Zhang Zikai might be in danger, especially Zhang Zikai.

It had nothing to do with her, but she was present, so she could be in trouble.

“Alright, we should stop talking about that. Why don’t we go celebrate it now,” said Gu Ning.

“Of course, I need to thank you all for your help today. Where are we going? I’ll pay the bill,” said Song Miaoge.

“Let’s go to the KTV club! I haven’t gone there for a long time,” said Zhang Zikai.

Therefore, they went to a KTV club.

...

Because they had a holiday tomorrow, Chu Peihan and her friends went back to City F by plane at 7:30 pm that night.

They knew Gu Ning was very busy and wouldn’t be free to gather together with them and they also wanted to go home to see their families, so they went back home. And if they were home, they could have a gathering with Hao Ran and the other boys too.

...

At 11:30 pm, Gu Ning and her friends left the club. She drove Zhang Zikai and Song Miaoge back first, then went to Century City with Baili Zongxue.

At 8 am the next morning, Gu Ning went to the airport, followed by Gao Yi and Qiao Ya.

Last night, Gu Ning already had a call with Leng Shaoting, so he knew that she was going to City B today.

Leng Shaoting needed to deal with something else, so he couldn’t come back to the capital or go to City B with Gu Ning. Instead Leng Shaoting promised to see her in a few days if he was free.

After Gu Ning entered the lounge, she met a familiar face, which she actually wasn’t very familiar with. They had only met once before, and she was a friend of a friend. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The person was Zi Beiying’s friend, Xia Maiqi.

“Miss Gu, what a coincidence!” Xia Maiqi greeted Gu Ning. Although Xia Maiqi had had met Gu Ning once, she had a deep impression of her and learned a lot about her from the Internet.

“Hi, Miss Xia, nice to see you.” Gu Ning politely replied, “Where are you flying to?”

“To Country Y for business,” said Xia Maiqi. All of a sudden, Xia Maiqi looked serious. “Oh, have you heard about what happened to Beiying?”

Hearing that, Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second. She obviously knew nothing about what had happened to Zi Beiying, but it couldn’t be something good given Xia Maiqi’s expression. “What happened to her? I haven’t contacted her for a long while,”

Gu Ning didn’t know, and Xia Maiqi had no intention of hiding it from her. “She told me her family had conflicts with another family and suffered a great loss in business. The heir of the family wanted to force her to marry him or he wouldn’t let her family go. The man is terrible and Beiying dislikes him, so her family disagreed. Precisely because of that, it became a big problem. She’s cornered now.”

Gu Ning frowned. “I’ll call her later to ask about it.”

“Sure, I can’t do anything to help her out, and I’m worried about her,” said Xia Maiqi anxiously.

“Don’t worry, it’ll be fine,” said Gu Ning to comfort her.

“I hope so!” Xia Maiqi could only have hope.

After that, they separated, because Xia Maiqi was going to board.

Separating from Xia Maiqi, Gu Ning took out her phone to call Zi Beiying.

Zi Beiying was surprised to receive Gu Ning’s call, because Gu Ning had never called her of her own accord before after she came home.

“Gu Ning?” Because Gu Ning had never called her before, she doubted whether it was really Gu Ning. She called Gu Ning’s name with uncertainty.

“Yeah.” Gu Ning said, “What are you busy with these days?”

Gu Ning didn’t bring up what Xia Maiqi told her right away, but exchanged greetings with Zi Beiying first. It would be better if Zi Beiying was willing to tell her.

“Staying at home all day. I do want to see you in your country, but my family has some trouble now, so I can’t go anywhere,” said Zi Beiying, sounding upset.

In fact, she didn’t mean to keep it secret from Gu Ning, but she was reluctant to share the bad news with Gu Ning because she didn’t want to make Gu Ning feel worried too.

“What happened?” asked Gu Ning with concern.

Zi Beiying took Gu Ning as her friend, so she decided to be honest. “I went to Country Y the other day, and had a conflict against the younger heir of the Cretan family, Charles Cretan. His family is a famous illegal gang in Country Y. After finding out my family background, Charles paid special attention to me and tried to force me to marry him. He doesn’t like me at all, but simply wants my family support. I’ve heard about Charles. He’s cruel and ruthless. Now, the brothers of the Cretan family are competing against each other for the position of the sole heir of their family, so Charles needs support.”

“Why don’t you ally with Charles’s brother?” asked Gu Ning. Actually, since Gu Ning could think of that, the Zi family had thought about it already. After all, the Zi family wasn’t an ordinary family, so it didn’t do that for a reason.

“It won’t work. Charles’s older brother, Chas, is working with my family’s enemy, the munitioner of Country Y, the Bruni family. He won’t work with us,” said Zi Beiying.

“What’s the current situation?” asked Gu Ning.

“Because of Charles, my family has lost many munitions during a deal, but we don’t have proof. Instead, we only have evidence leading to another family which isn’t involved at all. We all know it’s Charles! However, we can’t do anything about it now. Most importantly, Charles is in Country Y, so is my family. Our hands are tied,” said Zi Beiying.
