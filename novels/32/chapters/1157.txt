1158 Help Yuan Mao“s Family

However, after being framed, Yuan Mao’s father lost his job and had to pay two million yuan as compensation, so they sold the apartment and their car. So now, they lived in a rented apartment.

The rent and utilities added up to nearly two thousand yuan a month.

Before Yuan Mao’s father broke his leg, he could make at least five thousand yuan monthly, and with Yuan Mao’s mother’s salary, their family had an income of ten thousand yuan every month.

It was enough for Yuan Mao’s family to pay their household expenses and his tuition. Unfortunately, Yuan Mao’s father was injured afterwards, and they spent all their savings to treat his father. It was very hard for Yuan Mao’s mother to support their family alone.

What was worse was that none of their relatives was willing to help them.

As a result, Yuan Mao had to quit school to help his mother to support their family.

When Gu Ning arrived at Yuan Mao’s home, she told Yuan Mao’s parents why she came, but Yuan Mao’s parents didn’t believe her at the beginning.

Yuan Mao’s parents were both simple, and they didn’t believe that there was something like free lunch in this world.

Even though Gu Ning only wanted Yuan Mao to work for Shenghua for 10 years with a decent pay, they still couldn’t believe it. It was too good to be true after all.

Gu Ning explained that she really appreciated Yuan Mao’s character and skills, and that she also had deep sympathy for what he had been through. She wanted to help him out since he was excellent at studying.

In order to set Yuan Mao’s parents’ mind at rest, Gu Ning told them that she was the owner of Shenghua Real Estate and Jade Beauty Jewelry.

However, it wasn’t persuasive enough to just tell them, so Gu Ning showed them many pieces of news about her on the Internet. She also played a video of the release conference of Jade Beauty Jewelry, which was solid proof to prove her identity.

They had heard of Jade Beauty Jewelry because it was quite famous recently, but they didn’t know who its boss was. They didn’t surf on the Internet, so they missed a lot of news about it.

To their surprise, the owner of Jade Beauty Jewelry was a young girl, who was less than 20 years old.

After the great shock, Yuan Mao’s parents chose to trust Gu Ning.

Gu Ning then signed the labor contract with Yuan Mao.

Yuan Mao’s father repeatedly thanked Gu Ning and told Yuan Mao to study hard to return Gu Ning’s favor.

Without delay, Gu Ning transferred twenty thousand yuan to Yuan Mao’s father’s bank card to help them live a better life.

Gu Ning would pay for Yuan Mao’s tuition and living expenses in school as well, but it didn’t mean that she would support his family.

Anyway, Yuan Mao’s father could fully recover in a few days, and go back to work.

Gu Ning understood that Yuan Mao’s father used to be a good architect, so she had the idea to give Yuan Mao’s father a chance. Although his father wasn’t able to be in charge of a major project, he was capable of managing a small project.

Knowing that Gu Ning could help him get a construction project, Yuan Mao’s father was thrilled. However, he was worried that he might cause Gu Ning trouble since his leg was broken now.

His kindness impressed Gu Ning, so Gu Ning said that she could cure his leg. Yuan Mao’s father wasn’t seriously injured, so it was easy for Gu Ning to cure him.

Yuan Mao’s family, instead, declined Gu Ning’s offer, because they thought that Gu Ning wanted to take them to a hospital. They were unwilling to spend Gu Ning’s money, no matter how rich she was.

Gu Ning smiled then took out a porcelain bottle. “We don’t need to go to the hospital. This medicine is effective enough to cure your leg. You can apply it to your broken leg three times a day, and it’ll go back to normal within several days.”

“Within several days?”

Yuan Mao’s father was shocked and couldn’t believe it, but he thought that there was no reason for Gu Ning to lie to them. So, even though he didn’t believe it, he still decided to try it. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He trusted Gu Ning and thanked her again.

After that, Gu Ning stood up and was about to leave. Before she walked out, she told Yuan Mao to go back to school tomorrow.

She would handle everything for him, so he didn’t need to worry about anything, he could just focus on his studies.

It was time for lunch, so Yuan Mao’s parents politely invited Gu Ning to stay and share the meal with them. They weren’t rich, but they would do their best to treat their guest well.

Gu Ning declined because she needed to deal with something else later, but she promised that she would visit them again when she was free.

Since Gu Ning said that, Yuan Mao’s parents didn’t insist and walked her out.

Once Gu Ning was gone, some neighbors walked over and asked Yuan Mao’s parents what happened.
