Chapter 399 Negotiation with Song Manni

Speaking of Song Meixin, the woman’s face was full of obvious dislike. “The bitch is so terrible. She even wanted to make Feng Jie the father of her child. However, thanks to her, you were able to see the real face of Feng Jie. Feng Jie’s family is really shameless! Feng Jie is the one who is infertile, but they blamed you for it! I have to say that karma is real.”

Hearing that, Gu Ning was surprised by the drama. Luckily, the result wasn’t bad. However, if she had been Song Manni, she would have tortured the whole shameless family to get revenge.

Gu Ning thought that Song Manni was a clever, skillful woman. Since Song Manni planned to start anew, and Gu Ning lacked qualified workers, why didn’t she hire Song Manni?

When they had almost finished the meal, the woman who was Song Manni’s friend received a call and left, while Song Manni sat there alone.

Gu Ning took her half-finished dishes walking to the table where Song Manni sat. “May I have a seat?”

Song Manni recognized Gu Ning at first glance and was a little surprised. “Please.”

With Song Manni’s permission, Gu Ning sat down on the opposite side.

“Hi, I’m Gu Ning. And I couldn’t help but hear your talk with your friend just then. I happened to hear that you want to change your job and live in a new environment. May I know your previous job?” Gu Ning asked.

Song Manni thought that Gu Ning was just casually chatting with her, so she didn’t mind. “Interior design.”

“It’s a great job with a high salary, but quite tiring. Do you want to continue doing that?” Gu Ning asked.

“Well, just as you said. It’s a great job with a high salary, but quite tiring too. If it hadn’t been for my family, I wouldn’t have worked so hard to make money. I even got cervical spondylosis[1] because of it, but I’m single now, and I can take it easy.”

“As for the job, it depends. If I continue to work as an interior designer, I’ll work less and take care of myself. And I don’t mind changing to a new job either,” Song Manni said.

Since Song Manni was willing to be honest with her, Gu Ning laid her cards on the table. “I think that you must be really good to be able to be a design director at such a young age, so I’d like to hire you as my employee. As for the title, you can choose. Whether it’s jewelry store manager, hotel manager, restaurant manager or shopping mall manager, just say it. As long as you think you’re qualified, you can work in my headquarters too. If you’re interested, we can talk more about the details.”

Song Manni was surprised by what Gu Ning had said. What? Her headquarters?

It wasn’t because Gu Ning was so young, many young people started their own companies, but because it sounded like Gu Ning had many companies under her name. Like a jewelry store, hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and so on. It wasn’t a company. It was a business group!

Although Gu Ning looked serious, and it didn’t seem like she was lying, Song Manni still doubted its authenticity. They were merely strangers after all.

Gu Ning didn’t interrupt her thoughts, but enjoyed her dishes and waited for Song Manni to get her mind back.

After a long time, Song Manni finally got her mind back and said, “If it’s true, I’d like to have a try. However, the point is whether it is real?”

“Of course it is, and I’ll prove it to you after the meal,” Gu Ning said.

Since Gu Ning said so, Song Manni temporarily believed her. “Where would my workplace be?”

“Three second-tier cities in Province D, and the capital,” Gu Ning replied.

Hearing the capital, Song Manni’s eyes lit up. She had wanted to build her career in the capital, but because of her ex-husband, she had chosen to stay in City F instead. Unfortunately, it didn’t end up well.

“Are you sure that you’re not an agent?” Song Manni asked with doubt, because the range of the company was so big, and she couldn’t believe that Gu Ning was able to run a big business group of that size. That was the point. Gu Ning was too young to be a founder of a large business group in her eyes.

Gu Ning wasn’t mad at all. It wouldn’t be normal if Song Manni didn’t doubt her.

At that time, Gu Ning finished her meal. She took out a file with all the copies of her properties from inside her backpack. Normally, Gu Ning would put her important stuff in her telepathic eye space. She didn’t mind letting Song Manni know her real identity, because she chose her.

However, Gu Ning wouldn’t tell Song Manni everything about her properties. She only showed Song Manni some of the documents for Jade Beauty Jewelry, Shenghua Real Estate, Fenghua Entertainment, and the other companies that she had just acquired from the Hongyun Group.

When Song Manni read the copies, she was completely astonished.

“Wow...” Song Manni looked at Gu Ning with amazement after reading, but couldn’t say anything.

This young girl is so unbelievable! She’s the real boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry and Shenghua Real Estate, and she just acquired many properties from the Hongyun Group

Song Manni hadn’t heard of Fenghua Entertainment yet, because it was a newly-established company, so she wasn’t very interested. However, she did know Shenghua Real Estate. The company had almost gone bankrupt but had been bought by a mysterious person.

Unexpectedly, the mysterious person was this young girl right before her eyes. She also knew about Jade Beauty Jewelry which had just caused a big sensation in City F, and was the most popular brand in the jewelry industry now. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Gu Ning had really astonished Song Manni. Although the documents could be forged, Song Manni chose to believe Gu Ning.
