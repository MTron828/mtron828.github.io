Chapter 2559: A Baby’s Cry

When there was less traffic on the road, Gu Ning sped up and immediately got rid of the cultivator.

The cultivator was hardly comparable to Gu Ning at driving skills, and a taxi couldn’t be faster than Gu Ning’s car, so it was normal that he couldn’t catch up with her.

He subconsciously wondered whether Gu Ning saw him and deliberately got rid of him, but he soon denied it. Gu Ning was just a mortal. Even though she was strong, she shouldn’t be able to notice him.

Therefore, the cultivator who followed Gu Ning thought that maybe Gu Ning drove so fast because she needed to rush to deal with something.

Anyway, because he lost her, he had to go back to the Capital University and continue to wait for Gu Ning. If Gu Ning returned, he would find her again.

Baili Zongxue didn’t notice that someone was following them, but she noticed that Gu Ning was purposely speeding up. Therefore, she guessed that someone was following them. After all, their flight wouldn’t be taking off soon, so there was no need for them to rush.

Out of curiosity, Baili Zongxue asked, “Why are you driving so fast? Is someone following behind?”

“Yes.” Gu Ning replied.

“What? How come I didn’t notice?” Baili Zongxue was surprised, because she didn’t notice anything was wrong.

“Because he’s at a high level,” said Gu Ning. She honestly told Baili Zongxue that it was a cultivator who was following them.

“You’ve been targeted again.” Baili Zongxue put on a resigned look. It had happened many times before that Gu Ning was followed by cultivators, but they usually spied on her because of the magical power in the medicines produced by Colaine. She wondered whether this time was different.

Anyway, Baili Zongxue understood what she could ask about, and what she shouldn’t.

Actually, even if Baili Zongxue asked about it, Gu Ning wouldn’t tell her the truth. Gu Ning wasn’t sure whether this time she was being spied on for the same reason. If not, she couldn’t tell Baili Zongxue.

Because Gu Ning sped up, they arrived at the airport about forty minutes later. After parking the car, they went straight to check in.

“Well, I’ve never been on a plane before. I’m a bit nervous now,” said Baili Zongxue nervously. Although she was a cultivator, it didn’t mean she would be used to everything.

Cultivators were stronger than mortals, but they would also get curious and nervous when they saw something they had never seen before.

“Many people feel nervous when they take a flight for the first time. Some people even worry that the plane might crash! I had the same worries before, but I still believe planes are very safe. It’s not likely to have accidents, but it’ll be really hard to survive once an accident happens,” said Gu Ning.

Comparatively, planes were safe and weren’t likely to have accidents. During these ten years, only two bad plane crashes had happened. Car accidents, however, would happen over a hundred times within a year.

If they ran into a car accident, they might be able to save themselves no matter how serious it was, but if it was a plane crash, it would be difficult for them to survive.

“What?” Baili Zongxue was slightly anxious. As Gu Ning said, it wasn’t likely to have an accident, but it was still a possibility, so Baili Zongxue couldn’t help thinking about the worse situation.

“Relax, we’ll be fine.” Gu Ning said to comfort her. She didn’t worry about plane accidents, because the probability was too low.

Hearing that, Baili Zongxue felt much relieved. During these years, she had never heard of a plane crash, so she shouldn’t have run into one on the first time. However, sometimes, accidents happened when you weren’t prepared at all.

After waiting at the airport for about forty minutes, Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue started boarding the plane.

When the plane began to move, a baby’s cry suddenly sounded in the cabin, just opposite Gu Ning’s seat.

No matter how the baby’s mother tried to keep it quiet, the baby wouldn’t stop crying, which irritated other passengers.

At the beginning, everyone could understand and bear it, but some passengers lost their patience a few minutes later. The mother was criticized and had to repeatedly apologize to the other passengers.

Gu Ning slightly frowned. For some reason, she had a premonition.

She didn’t think too much about it and simply asked the mother whether the baby was uncomfortable.

The baby’s mother didn’t know why, because the baby looked fine earlier before it suddenly started crying. It had never happened before.

Gu Ning couldn’t stand the baby’s cry any longer either, and she was worried that the baby might be sick. She had the idea of helping them.

“If you don’t mind, let me carry it for a while. I’ll try to make it quiet down,” Gu Ning said to the baby’s mother.

“Please.” The baby’s mother didn’t know what she could do, so she could only listen to Gu Ning. They were on a plane anyway, so Gu Ning couldn’t do anything bad to the baby. Therefore, the baby’s mother gave the baby to Gu Ning. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Afterwards, Gu Ning immediately released magical power and put it into the baby’s body. She couldn’t see whether the baby was sick, so she only put some magical power into the baby’s body, then observed it for a while.

Within a few moments, the baby stopped crying.

Seeing that, everyone was amazed. Gu Ning looked very young, but she was very good at keeping the baby quiet.

The baby’s mother was also relieved when the baby stopped crying, because she thought that her baby might be sick.

“I think the baby just felt a little uncomfortable,” said Baili Zongxue and Gu Ning agreed.

The baby stopped crying and the other passengers became quiet too, then the plane took off.

About twenty minutes later, the plane flew steadily in the air. The baby slept well in Gu Ning’s arms, so Gu Ning gave it back to its mother. The baby’s mother thanked Gu Ning again and again.
