Chapter 729 Promote Products

“Do you mean they could be sent by those businessmen who are jealous of Jade Beauty Jewelry?”

“I think it’s highly possible.”

“What a dirty trick!”

“Don’t they know that the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry has a powerful friend circle?”

Hearing people’s discussion, the man was scared.

“Jade Beauty Jewelry will, of course, never deceive its consumers, and we’re willing to take the responsibility if there is any problem with the quality of our products. However, if anyone dares to cause trouble here, I’m not afraid to pay him or her back.” Gu Ning’s voice was as cold as ice, and was quite threatening.

In fact, Gu Ning alone was very powerful.

All of a sudden, the man ran outside, in case Gu Ning caught and punished him.

However, Gu Ning didn’t bother to do that.

The man’s reaction already proved everything, and others kept on shopping in the store of Jade Beauty Jewelry.

“Everyone, in order to celebrate, each of you can have 20% off as long as you buy jewelry here today. If the bill exceeds a million yuan, we’ll send you a piece of jewelry which is worth around a hundred thousand yuan!” Gu Ning said. She was a very generous boss.

A VIP member could only have 5% off, but they could have 20% off today! It was a big discount in the jewelry industry. The people in the store all cheered hearing the exciting news.

“Miss Gu, I hope that you can celebrate more in the future so that we can have more discounts,” a woman joked.

“Ha-ha, right!” others all agreed.

A 20% discount could save them over a hundred thousand yuan after all.

“No problem!” Gu Ning also felt happy when her customers were excited.

Seeing Gu Ning being so happy, Leng Shaoting was also happy.

After that, Gu Ning said to the woman who just joked with her, “Ma’am, I noticed that there is acne on your face. Why don’t you try a Kouzi facial mask? It’s very effective and safe.”

Gu Ning seized this chance to promote her skincare products.

“Really? Let me have a try please.” The woman’s face lit up at once.

Every woman cared about her skin condition, and other female customers in the store all turned to look at Gu Ning.

“Miss Gu, is it real?”

“Miss Gu, can I have a try too?”

“If it’s really effective and safe, I want to buy some.”

They discussed it and couldn’t wait to see its effect right now.

That was exactly what Gu Ning wanted to see. “Ma’am, would you mind removing your makeup to try the facial mask?”

“Of course not,” the woman said.

Gu Ning then guided the woman walking to the washroom, and others were waiting at the lounge.

Leng Shaoting, however, walked into the office to wait for Gu Ning, because he felt uncomfortable being stared at by those women outside.

The woman’s skin was a little dark yellow after removing the makeup. Although she took good care of her skin in her daily life, it wasn’t very useful. She was an aged woman anyway, so normal skincare products weren’t as effective as they were when she was young. Moreover, she probably didn’t use the kind of skincare products which were suitable for her skin type. Even a famous international brand wasn’t suitable for everyone.

Kouzi skincare products, on the other hand, had a special ingredient which was Gu Ning’s magical power crystal.

After removing the make-up, the woman walked out, and her skin was clearly not in a good condition.

Afterwards, Gu Ning took out a box of facial mask from her backpack right in front of them. She opened it, and helped the woman wear a piece.

“Is Kouzi a new skincare brand?”

“I’ve never heard of it before.”

“Yeah, it’s new, and I established it,” Gu Ning said. Given her good fame and reputation now, people tended to believe her words.

“What? You established it?” Hearing that, they were all surprised. Not only Jade Beauty Jewelry and Charm, but even Kouzi was also established by her!

“Yes, and I’m using this brand myself now. You can check my skin. I’m not wearing any makeup now,” Gu Ning said.

“Really?”

Hearing that, they were even more surprised. They had noticed Gu Ning’s smooth and shiny skin at the very beginning, but they just thought that she must be very good at making herself up. To their astonishment, Gu Ning wasn’t wearing any makeup! In that case, they were looking forward to seeing the effect of the facial mask even more.

Ten minutes later, the woman removed the facial mask from her face. Once the facial mask was removed, it was very obvious that half of the acne disappeared from her face, and her skin became much brighter.

“Jesus, half of the acne has disappeared.”

“It’s so amazing!”

“I think her skin is much brighter now.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“It’s hydrated too.”

The woman was also excited, and checked her face in the mirror at once.

“Miss Gu, where can I buy this facial mask?” she asked Gu Ning.

“I want to buy some too!” other women said with one accord.

“The first direct-sale store is in the capital, and we are opening a branch in City B in a few days. If you want to buy some right now, you can write down your names and numbers, and I’ll call them to send some here as soon as possible. Once the products are delivered here, you can come here to pick them up. How is that?” Gu Ning asked.
