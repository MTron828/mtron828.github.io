Chapter 1492: Poured in His Body

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Chen Yunlin instinctively wanted to run away, but she didn’t. However, she didn’t dare to move closer either. After hesitating for a while, she still walked to Qi Ziyue.

Her heart was pounding fast, and her body was shaking. When she moved near, she saw bruises, abrasions, and cuts all around Qi Ziyue’s body.

Chen Yunlin was frightened, because she didn’t know whether Qi Ziyue was still alive. She did everything she could to calm herself down and reached her finger out to test his breath. Luckily, Qi Ziyue was still breathing, although his breathing was quite weak.

Chen Yunlin knew that the Tang family was chasing Qi Ziyue now, but she had to send him to the hospital as soon as possible. She didn’t want him to die.

There were many hospitals in the capital, so she was confident that the Tang family couldn’t find him so soon. Therefore, Chen Yunlin called an ambulance.

About 10 minutes later, an ambulance arrived and Chen Yunlin followed Qi Ziyue to the hospital.

The doctor examined Qi Ziyue, but he didn’t tell Chen Yunlin the result right away. Instead, he asked for her relationship with Qi Ziyue.

Chen Yunlin told the doctor that they were friends, and the doctor asked her how Qi Ziyue was seriously hurt like that.

Chen Yunlin then told the doctor that a strange woman in black intruded into her home at midnight and attacked them.

The doctor, however, still had doubt after hearing her explanation. It was obvious that there was a large amount of drugs in Qi Ziyue’s body and Qi Ziyue hurt himself after being affected by the drug.

It was possible that Chen Yunlin was hiding the truth in order to protect Qi Ziyue. If not, it was also possible that she didn’t know that Qi Ziyue had taken a lot of drugs.

“Well, your friend took a lot of drugs, and the excessive amount of drug use caused confusion, judgment disorders, similar delusional schizophrenia, paranoia, auditory hallucinations, persecutory delusions, etc. Your friend was in a very bad situation, and the injuries around his body were likely caused by himself during the hallucinations,” the doctor said.

“W-What? He’s on drugs?” Chen Yunlin was shocked. To her astonishment, Qi Ziyue was using drugs.

“I can’t believe it. Are you sure?” It was totally unacceptable in Chen Yunlin’s eyes.

Seeing Chen Yunlin’s reaction, the doctor was sure that she didn’t know that Qi Ziyue was on drugs. “Yes, he just took a large amount of drugs.”

After making sure of it, Chen Yunlin still found it was hard for her to accept, because she knew how addictive and poisonous drugs were. She didn’t think that Qi Ziyue took the drugs on his own, and believed that it must have been the strange woman who forced him to do it.

She wanted to call the police, but gave up once she thought of the complicated situation Qi Ziyue was in.

“How’s he now?” Chen Yunlin asked.

“The injuries on his body aren’t serious, but the large amount of drugs badly affect his organs. He’s already addicted to the drugs and will suffer withdrawal after waking up. We can only cure his body, but we can’t help him get rid of the drugs. It’s complicated,” the doctor said.

Although the doctor hated drug addicts, he had to let Qi Ziyue use drugs if they wanted to treat him. Otherwise, he would easily lose his temper during the treatment.

“What should we do now?” Chen Yunlin felt helpless. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“We must cure his injuries first and we need drugs to help him stay calm during this time,” said the doctor.

“I don’t have drugs. He didn’t take the drugs on his own. Someone forced him to take the drugs!” Chen Yunlin said.

Hearing that, the doctor nodded. It wasn’t very likely for a drug addict to take such a large amount of drugs at a time. If Qi Ziyue was forced to take a lot of drugs, the person must have been trying to kill him. In that case, Qi Ziyue was quite lucky that he survived.

“Where is his family?” the doctor asked later.

“He doesn’t have a family,” Chen Yunlin said.

“Well, then he can make the decision himself after waking up,” the doctor said.

Chen Yunlin wasn’t Qi Ziyue’s family, so she didn’t have the right to make decisions for him. And whenever the patient had the ability to make decisions, he had to do it himself.

“Sure.” Chen Yunlin nodded.

Chen Yunlin asked for a VIP ward for Qi Ziyue, and told the doctor and nurses not to tell other people where Qi Ziyue stayed. She didn’t want anyone to find him.

It was part of doctors and nurses’ duties to keep patients’ privacy from other people, so they agreed. However, if the police came, nobody could stop them.

What Chen Yunlin didn’t know was that the Tang family didn’t turn to the police for help this time, because Qi Ziyue still had something on the Tang family.
