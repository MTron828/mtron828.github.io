Chapter 702 The Tang Family’s Enemies Take Action Again

Hearing that, Pan Zirui’s father was astonished.

He had also heard that Gu Ning made the first bucket of gold by stone gambling, but he had never seen it himself, so he wasn’t sure whether it was true. However, since his son told him in person, he believed that it could be real.

“Even though she doesn’t lack money, she’s a businesswoman after all. Doesn’t she want to make as much money as possible?” Pan Zirui’s father said. He was unwilling to give up.

“Dad, my boss is adamant and it’s useless to try to persuade her. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with her,” Pan Zirui said with impatience.

“Well.” Pan Zirui’s father didn’t know what to do now. He obviously didn’t want to ruin Pan Zirui’s relationship with Gu Ning. Although they couldn’t cooperate, nobody wanted to lose a friend and gain a new enemy.

Pan Zirui’s father thought for awhile, then remained silent.

It was still early, so Gu Ning went to visit Tang Haifeng in the hospital.

When she arrived, Master Lei and his son, Lei Haowei, were also in the ward.

The Mu family who maintained a good relationship with the Tang family also came to visit Tang Haifeng.

The leading role in the Mu family was Mu Xuxin who was around 50 years old, and his son, Mu Wenqi who was about 27 years old. In addition to them, Zhao Yiru was also there.

Tang Yunrong, Jiang Lihua and Tang Jiakai stayed with Tang Haifeng, while Tang Yunhang and Cao Ruihua were gone for their work.

Tang Jiakai didn’t know that his grandfather had been injured until that afternoon. Luckily, his grandfather was fine now.

Cao Wenjun and Cao Wenxin had also visited Tang Haifeng this afternoon, and they left two hours later. It would affect the patient’s condition if there were too many people in the ward.

Although Tang Haifeng was fine now, they still needed to act like he was injured.

Zhao Yiru came to visit Tang Haifeng before the Lei family, and he noticed that Tang Haifeng was pretending to be unconscious. Tang Haifeng didn’t want to keep it a secret from him either, so Tang Haifeng opened his eyes when Zhao Yiru was by his side, but he didn’t tell him many details.

The Lei family and the Mu family, however, Tang Haifeng decided to hide the truth from them, not because he didn’t trust them, but because it would be better if fewer people knew the truth.

“Well, he was fine in the afternoon yesterday, but now...” Master Lei was sorrowful, and blamed himself for this. “I wish I had persuaded him to visit my friend with me.”

Master Lei had invited Tang Haifeng to enjoy tea at one of his friends’ places, but Tang Haifeng had declined so he hadn’t insisted. If he had insisted, Tang Haifeng would have agreed. Master Lei felt quite regretful that he had missed the chance to save his old friend’s life. However, that was fate.

“Uncle Lei, please don’t blame yourself for this. It has nothing to do with you,” Tang Yunrong said to comfort Master Lei.

“Indeed! Uncle Lei, it’s not your fault at all,” Jiang Lihua said.

“What did the doctor say?” Lei Haowei asked. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Although he seems fine and healthy from the report, he’s stayed unconscious for a long time,” Tang Yunrong sighed with worry.

“It’s even more serious if we can’t find the cause, because we don’t know how to deal with it now,” Jiang Lihua said, and nobody noticed that she was just acting. They felt a little guilty to deceive Master Lei, but they had to do it.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting walked into the ward together. When Gu Ning’s sight fell on Mu Xuxin, she was surprised, because K resembled Mu Xuxin. K’s real name was Mu Ye. Was there any family connection between them? Was it just a coincidence?

Gu Ning greeted Master Lei and Zhao Yiru, then Tang Yunrong introduced Lei Haowei, Mu Xuxin and Mu Wenqi to Gu Ning. Gu Ning also greeted them politely.

Master Lei and Zhao Yiru were aware that Gu Ning was Tang Yunfan’s biological daughter, but the others didn’t know, so they were quite surprised.

Tang Yunrong explained that Tang Haifeng regarded Gu Ning as his own granddaughter because Gu Ning closely resembled Tang Yunfan.

Tang Haifeng had told them not to expose Gu Ning’s real identity before they made it public. Tang Haifeng said the same thing to Master Lei, so Master Lei also kept it a secret and didn’t even tell his own son.

They all knew that Tang Yunfan never married or had any children, so they believed Tang Yunrong’s words.

Tang Yunrong also introduced Leng Shaoting as Gu Ning’s friend, and didn’t tell them many details.

The Lei family and the Mu family left after a while.

Since they were gone, Tang Haifeng opened his eyes and relaxed his limbs.

Zhao Yiru stayed for a while longer before he walked out.

Tang Haifeng said, “I think that they will take action again after tomorrow.”

They were, of course, the Tang family’s enemies. However, to Tang Haifeng’s surprise, their enemies took action right away.

Quan Mingkai called Tang Yunrong and told her that there was a sudden problem with the proposal, and their business partner would arrive at 2 pm tomorrow afternoon. They had to hold a meeting with the board of directors to discuss it at 10 am tomorrow.

It couldn’t be a coincidence. Without a strong leader in the Tang family’s business group, the business partners felt anxious, which was a good chance to elect a new chairman.

No matter what, members of the Tang family had to attend the meeting tomorrow.
