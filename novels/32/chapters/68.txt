Chapter 69: Trapped

Although Master Yan liked this wine cup from the Tang Dynasty, he had just gotten an ink-slab. He wouldn’t compete with Master Fu again.

“Master Yan, how much is this wine cup?” Master Fu asked.

“Those wine cups in the museum were worth three hundred thousand yuan each 10 years ago. By now, its price must be 10 times higher. Around three million yuan,” Master Yan said.

Although this wasn’t the royal object used by Empress Wu, it was an object in the palace. And the quality was superior. It must have been used by a royal, so the price was still not low.

“Great, then I’ll pay three million yuan. How about that Girl Gu?” Master Fu asked Gu Ning.

“No problem,” Gu Ning replied.

After the deal, they transferred the money without signing contracts.

Gu Ning trusted those two old men. They wouldn’t regret or break rules.

Besides, the deals were done. Even if the antiques weren’t real, they could do nothing about it.

After everything was done, Master Yan and Master Fu then realized something important. Master Yan asked Gu Ning, “Did you buy the wine cup by chance too?”

“Yes,” Gu Ning said honestly.

Both Master Yan and Master Fu took a long breath in after Gu Ning’s affirmation.

Even though they had no idea how Gu Ning could know these two objects were authentic, they were surprised by her unbelievable luck.

Before long, Gu Ning asked to leave.

Master Fu intended to invite Gu Ning to have dinner with them, but Gu Ning refused because she had something else to deal with.

Before she left, Master Yan gave her a name card. “Girl, if you don’t mind, you can call me grandpa Yan, like the way you call Master Fu. If you need my support in the future, you can call me. And of course, if you have any other real antiques, you can let me have a look first, but I’ll only buy one if I like it.”

Apparently, Master Yan wanted to make a friend with Gu Ning.

“No need to worry, grandpa Yan. If I find out any authentic antiques in the future I’ll call you first,” Gu Ning said and took the name card.

She didn’t have her own name card, so she pulled out a piece of paper and a pen. She wrote down her name and phone number on the paper, then handed it to Master Yan.

“Hey! You can’t only turn to Master Yan! You must turn to me as well!” Master Fu said. He didn’t want to be left out.

“I will.” Gu Ning felt like laughing. These two seniors were really pleasant!

After Gu Ning was gone, Master Yan couldn’t help but compliment, “This girl is truly extraordinary!”

“Indeed! She’s even cut out three high-level jade this morning, and made a hundred million yuan at once!” Master Fu added.

“What? How is it possible? She cut out three high-level jade in a morning!” Master Yan was shocked. He had never heard of such a thing before.

Master Fu didn’t mention Gu Ning was going to open a jewelry company. If he had said so, Master Yan would probably be shocked dumb.

Master Fu knew what he could say, and what he shouldn’t. Gu Ning’s company hadn’t registered yet. It would be inappropriate to say it now.

Gu Ning had already called her driver when she had left the street of stone gambling. Her driver had arrived half an hour ago, but Gu Ning had met Master Fu and Master Yan halfway, and she was half an hour late. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When she went out of the street of antiques, she saw a familiar car and went over.

But when she opened the car door, she found the driver was a different man.

Before Gu Ning could ask, the young man opened his mouth first. “Nice to meet you, Miss Gu. The driver who drove you here felt a little uncomfortable, so I replaced him to be your driver today.”

Gu Ning didn’t doubt that. She nodded, then climbed into the car.

The car was started then left.

Driving away from the street of antiques, the car didn’t go back the same way that they came here. Before Gu Ning could ask again, the young driver explained, “It’s rush hour now. There is a traffic jam ahead. We can go another road, and save time. We’ll be back to the hotel within an hour.”

Gu Ning wasn’t familiar with City G, but she knew it must be super crowded in rush hour. Thus she didn’t doubt the driver’s explanation.

Like what the young driver had said, he had chosen a less crowded road.

But around 20 minutes later, the car drove into an ally in a remote place. Gu Ning then realized something must be wrong.

She immediately seized the young driver’s neck, and said coldly, “Stop the car.”

The young driver didn’t expect Gu Ning would realize so soon, and was so strong. When his neck was seized, he could hardly breathe. He stopped the car unconsciously.

“Tell me, who sent you?” Gu Ning asked.

The young driver didn’t answer her question. Before he could, several men ran to surround the car from two meters away.

Gu Ning was annoyed. She directly knocked the young driver unconscious.

“Did the girl just knock the driver unconscious?” A man standing in front of the car saw what had just happened inside it. He said in surprise to another man beside him.

“What?” The other man was also surprised. A teenage girl knocked a grown-up man unconscious?

But the man wasn’t frightened by Gu Ning at all. He ordered instead, “Go pull the girl out now!”

However, before anyone came forward, Gu Ning opened the car door herself.

Her Jade Eyes was full of power now, and she was full of energy too. She wasn’t afraid of these men outside at all.

Gu Ning stepped out herself, so the man who planned to pull her out stopped.

When they saw Gu Ning’s face, all the men were amazed by her beauty.

What a beautiful young girl!

Gu Ning coldly glanced over those men before her. They were all aged between 20 and 30, and behaved like gangsters.

They must be gangsters. Gu Ning thought to herself.

The man who was their head was around 30. He was a bulky man in a black sweater and loose pants. He seemed violent.

If an ordinary person had seen him, he or she would be terrified, but Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl. She wasn’t scared at all.

“Li Zhenzhen sent you here, right?” It was an affirmative tone.

Gu Ning only had bad blood with Li Zhenzhen when she was in City G. No one would do that except her.
