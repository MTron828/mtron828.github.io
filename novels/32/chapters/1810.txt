Chapter 1812: Have a Competition with the Instructor

Although she was impressed by him, it didn’t mean she was going to do anything right away.

Besides, given the gap of social status between their families, it was impossible for her to have a happy ending with him.

Song Miaoge was born in a military family, so she knew a lot more about the military circle than other people. She was aware that there were many young officers who were more outstanding than Rong Jue, like the eldest grandson of the Leng family, Leng Shaoting. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Leng Shaoting was a 27-year-old major general, and was her real idol. However, Song Miaoge had never met Leng Shaoting before, so she didn’t know what he looked like. As a result, she had no special feelings towards him. As for Rong Jue, she had seen him many times.

Baili Zongxue, as a cultivator, had magical power to protect herself, so she didn’t suffer at all under the hot sunlight.

Even if she had to keep standing at attention for a day, it wouldn’t be difficult.

Because Baili Zongxue had magical power, she was also in a very good condition, which attracted Rong Jue’s attention too. By a quick glance, he knew that this girl wasn’t simple.

It was hard for other ordinary students not to sweat when they held the pose. Some couldn’t stand the uncomfortable feeling, so they secretly wiped it off once the instructor didn’t pay attention to them.

Some of them were lucky that they weren’t discovered, while some had bad luck and were called to stand out at the front of the team. They had to keep standing at attention for 10 minutes longer than their classmates.

Seeing some were punished, other students didn’t dare to secretly wipe the sweat.

Once the time was over, the instructor told them to have a break of 10 minutes. All the students sank to the ground with moans of pain. No one bothered to care about their image now. They had no strength to walk to cool places either.

Gu Ning didn’t feel tired at all, so she didn’t sit down, but simply relaxed her limbs.

“Jesus, Gu Ning, don’t you feel tired at all?”

“You’re awesome! We’re exhausted.”

“...”

Everyone was amazed by Gu Ning’s condition.

“Don’t you forget that Gu Ning is a kung fu lover? She’s excellent at kung fu. She must have received professional training before, so half an hour of standing at attention is nothing in her eyes.” Someone explained it to other people.

Hearing that, the others nodded.

“Right, I started practicing kung fu when I was little, so it’s indeed a piece of cake for me to stand at attention for half an hour,” said Gu Ning. She wasn’t bragging, because it was the truth.

“Really?”

The second Gu Ning finished, they heard a serious male voice from their back. Gu Ning knew it must be their instructor.

She turned around afterwards and said with confidence, “Yeah.”

Facing the instructor, Gu Ning didn’t seem nervous at all. She maintained her confidence as always, while other students were slightly scared. They somehow felt relieved hearing Gu Ning’s answer.

Even though Gu Ning was telling the truth, some thought she was deliberately challenging the instructor.

“In that case, you must be good at martial arts, right?” asked the instructor. He stared straight at Gu Ning, but without malice.

The instructor tried to make Gu Ning feel stressed, but unfortunately he failed.

“I think I’m not bad,” said Gu Ning.

In fact, she was quite good at kung fu, but she tended to be modest.

Hearing that, the instructor squinted sizing up Gu Ning for a few seconds, then said, “Do you dare to have a competition with me?”

Actually, from Gu Ning’s performance of standing at attention just now, the instructor knew that she must have received training before. He was curious to know more about that and seized a chance to ask her right now.

All the students were excited. They knew Gu Ning wasn’t weak at all, so they didn’t think she would lose. On the contrary, they believed that Gu Ning could easily win.

At the same time, they had worries. What if the instructor was embarrassed by losing the competition to Gu Ning in public? Would he pick on Gu Ning afterwards in the military training?

They weren’t judging the instructor, but it could happen.

“Sure, but will you hold a grudge against me if you lose the competition and feel embarrassed?” asked Gu Ning. She wasn’t projecting her shortcomings on the instructor, she was just unwilling to be involved in unnecessary trouble because of that, so she decided to ask that question beforehand.

Hearing Gu Ning’s question, the instructor was displeased. “I’m not a man who’ll refuse to admit failure. I’m not a backstabber either.”

Although he was dissatisfied with Gu Ning’s question, he understood her worries. After all, he was the instructor, and all the students had to obey his orders. If Gu Ning dared to behave against him, she might be punished severely.

“Great, we can have the competition.” Since the instructor said that, Gu Ning agreed. She chose to trust him, but she actually wouldn’t be afraid even if the instructor was going to pick on her.

Seeing that, the others moved away leaving some space for Gu Ning and the instructor.

Gu Ning and the instructor stood opposite each other in the middle of the crowd.

Students of other classes noticed what they were doing and ran over curiously. Because it was break time, many people came to watch them.

Some instructors also walked over, Rong Jue included.

“What’s going on here?” Rong Jue asked in a serious tone.

“Captain Rong, we want to have a competition of fighting skills,” said the instructor.

Rong Jue turned to look at Gu Ning. He didn’t see any disagreement from her face, so he didn’t say anything about it.

It was quite normal in the military to have a fighting competition, so it wasn’t a big deal as long as the student agreed.

Other people were all amazed once they heard that the instructor was going to have a fighting competition with Gu Ning.

Those who were aware of Gu Ning’s level got excited as well. They believed that she would definitely win, while some thought it was impossible, because the instructor was a soldier who trained every day.

People who knew nothing about Gu Ning thought that she was doomed to fail.

As for those who disliked Gu Ning, they were waiting to see her being beaten.

“Are you ready?” the instructor asked Gu Ning.

“I’m ready,” Gu Ning said.

“Great, let’s begin now,” said the instructor.

Afterwards, both Gu Ning and the instructor moved at the same time.

It was very easy for Gu Ning to defeat the instructor within a minute, but Gu Ning had no intention of making him completely fail, so she didn’t use much strength at the beginning. As a result, it seemed to be a draw.
