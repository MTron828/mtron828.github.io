Chapter 2877: Master Dai Wakes up

What was worse, the middle-aged man was also injured. He vomited up and spat a mouthful of blood.

He became angrier, because it meant the spell he cast on Master Dai was removed by someone.

Who did it? How could the person remove his spell?

Did Master Dai have a relationship with a

wizard at a higher level?

Given the current situation, he couldn’t go to the Dai family’s house again. If he ran into a wizard who was more powerful than him, he could be caught. And now he was injured, so he needed to recover. As a result, he immediately returned to his room when he just reached the elevator.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

No one saw the scene because there was nobody around, but Si Jin saw it. As a cultivator, she wasn’t surprised.

When the middle-aged man turned around, Si Jin stepped back to the side at once.

After the middle-aged man got back into his room, Si Jin walked into the next room and continued to spy on him. She also sent Jing Yunyao a message, telling her about the situation.

Because the middle-aged man had special abilities, he must have a good hearing as well. If Si Jin made a call, he would be able to hear her.

Once Jing Yunyao received Si Jin’s message, she replied to her. They had solved the problem, so Si Jin could directly catch the middle-aged man if he wanted to run away. They would go to see her after everything was done in the Dai family.

After Shangguan Yang killed the poisonous worm, the Taoist talisman became useless, because it only had an effect on evil beings.

The moment the worm was removed, Master Dai went back to normal. He couldn’t help but shout in pain and the wound on his chest began to bleed. Dai Xiongyu got nervous, but didn’t dare to rush forward.

The next moment, Shangguan Yang took out a pill and helped Master Dai take it. Then he sprayed some medicinal powder on Master Dai’s wound.

After taking the pill, Master Dai stopped shouting, but he was still uncomfortable.

After being covered by medicinal powder, the wound stopped bleeding, but it was still bloody.

Shangguan Yang helped Master Dai move and sit down on the sofa, then he asked Dai Xiongyu, “Do you have bandages?”

Shangguan Yang’s Qiankun Bag was different from Gu Ning’s telepathic eye space which had everything. Even though there were bandages in Shangguan Yang’s Qiankun Bag, he couldn’t take them out in front of Dai Xiongyu, or his secret would be exposed.

His medicinal powder was very little, so he could carry it with him and Dai Xiongyu didn’t pay much attention to it.

“Of course, I’ll go get them right now.” Dai Xiongyu ran out of the study at once.

Outside, Junior Mrs. Dai didn’t go in but waited all the time, so she was anxious as well when she heard Master Dai’s shouts.

When Dai Xiongyu walked out, she immediately asked him, “Xiongyu, how is it?”

“I need to get bandages now. We can talk about it later.” Dai Xiongyu rushed to find bandages and didn’t have much time to talk with Junior Mrs. Dai.

Since he said that, Junior Mrs. Dai didn’t stand in his way.

At the same time, Shangguan Yang took off Master Dai’s upper clothing. Jing Yunyao didn’t walk away, because it was an emergency and it wasn’t really embarrassing or inappropriate.

Before long, Dai Xiongyu was back with bandages and gave them to Shangguan Yang.

Shangguan Yang wrapped Master Dai’s wound, then told him to lie down on the sofa. He couldn’t move right now so Shangguan Yang told Dai Xiongyu to get a blanket to cover Master Dai.

It was summer and wasn’t cold, but Master Dai was in a special condition. He had just gotten rid of the poison, so he had to stay warm.

Dai Xiongyu immediately got a blanket and covered Master Dai’s body.

Master Dai wasn’t completely conscious right now. Because Shangguan Yang was unwilling to expose his secret, he didn’t fully cure Master Dai.

Within a few days, Master Dai would make a full recovery, but he would wake up a few minutes later. Therefore, Shangguan Yang and Jing Yunyao didn’t leave right away.

They would leave after Master Dai woke up, so that the Dai family could feel relieved.

“Sir, how’s my grandpa now?” Dai Xiongyu asked worriedly. He knew his grandfather was getting better, but he couldn’t be relieved until Shangguan Yang gave him the answer.

“He’s fine now. He’ll wake up in a few minutes,” Shangguan Yang said.

Hearing that, Dai Xiongyu was finally relieved and thanked Shangguan Yang. “Sir, thank you so much!”

“My pleasure,” Shangguan Yang said as he gave Dai Xiongyu a nod.

Then Dai Xiongyu suddenly realized that he hadn’t offered any tea or water to Jing Yunyao and Shangguan Yang. Without delay, he walked out and told Junior Mrs. Dai to pour two cups of tea.

Before long, Junior Mrs. Dai came over with two cups of tea.

Although Jing Yunyao and Shangguan Yang weren’t thirsty, they still accepted the tea.

After having a sip, Shangguan Yang felt that the tea tasted very good, so he asked Dai Xiongyu, “Can I know what tea this is? It tastes good.”

Hearing Shangguan Yang’s compliment, Dai Xiongyu was very happy and replied. “It’s Junshan Yinzhen. Because it’s my grandfather’s favorite, we made some by ourselves. We have a lot at home. If you like it, I’ll prepare some for you to take away.”

“Oh, thanks! That’ll be great.” Shangguan Yang accepted. Anyway, he had saved Master Dai’s life. He didn’t ask for anything, so he could take some tea as a gift.

“I’ll go prepare some right now,” Junior Mrs. Dai announced.

“Great,” Dai Xiongyu replied, then Junior Mrs. Dai walked away.

…

In the hotel, the middle-aged man called Yuan Wenye and reported everything to him.

When Yuan Wenye heard the result, he was shocked and angry.

How could someone be able to remove the spell? When did the Dai family have a relationship with such a skilled person?

Yuan Wenye couldn’t accept it, because it would be much more difficult for him to defeat the Dai family now.

Left with no choice, Yuan Wenye could only tell the middle-aged man to rest for a while.

…

In the Dai family’s house.

A few minutes later, Master Dai woke up, but he was still very weak and wasn’t fully conscious.

“Grandpa, you’re awake!” Dai Xiongyu immediately went forward. He squatted in front of the sofa in great excitement.

“What happened to me?” Master Dai couldn’t remember everything right now. He only felt the pain from his chest.

“Um…” Dai Xiongyu didn’t answer, but turned to look at Jing Yunyao. He didn’t know whether he should tell Master Dai the truth.
