Chapter 2079: Help Baili Zongxue

Baili Zongxue’s teammates became alert when they saw Leng Shaoting’s team because they were afraid Leng Shaoting came to steal their demonic monsters. Only Baili Zongxue was relaxed and wasn’t anxious.

“No, we’re going to help them,” said Gu Ning.

Hearing that, Mo Qilin felt relieved and remembered that Gu Ning had rescued Baili Zongxue in the first part of the game.

At the same time, he was more sure that they robbed Jing Yunyan of the magic crystal because they disliked him.

“May I help?” asked Leng Shaoting.

“Sure,” said Gu Ning.

Without delay, they took action.

Mo Qilin didn’t move because he knew his level very well and wouldn’t burden them.

“Let me help you!” When Gu Ning approached them, she shouted loudly in case they misunderstood her.

“Thanks!” Baili Zongxue felt grateful.

Baili Zongxue’s teammates were relieved too. They remembered that Gu Ning had rescued Baili Zongxue in the first part of the game, so they believed Gu Ning’s words.

With Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s help, the four demonic monsters were soon killed.

“Thank you so much!”

After the demonic monsters were killed, they didn’t rush to open their bodies to see whether there were magic crystals. Instead, they thanked Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting first.

“You’re welcome. Go check whether there are magic crystals in the demonic monsters’ bodies,” said Gu Ning. Gu Ning didn’t help Baili Zongxue open those demonic monsters’ bodies, and instead let her do it by herself.

“Sure!”

Baili Zongxue and her teammates went to open those demonic monsters’ bodies at once.

At the same time, Gu Ning went back to Leng Shaoting’s side and told him to leave.

When Baili Zongxue and her teammates finished, Gu Ning’s team was already far away.

If so, they didn’t stop them.

Afterwards, Baili Zongxue found a magic crystal from a demonic monster and her teammates cheered.

“If they hadn’t helped us, we would have suffered a lot to get it,” said Baili Zongxue’s teammate.

“Right, if there had been other people, this magic crystal would have been robbed away!” said Baili Zongxue.

“Zongxue, the girl has helped you twice. I’m almost convinced that you two know each other,” said Baili Zongxue’s other teammate.

“Yeah, I have the same feeling.” Another teammate chimed in.

“I don’t know her at all. She’s just very nice,” said Baili Zongxue. Although she was sure that she didn’t know the girl, she also somehow felt the girl was very familiar.

She wasn’t familiar with the girl’s appearance or voice, but her air. Had they met before and forgotten each other after a long time?

Thinking of that, Baili Zongxue thought it was possible.

“It wasn’t easy for us to get here. There are only two hours left, but I don’t think we should continue to walk deeper, or we’ll suffer a greater loss than gain if we encounter danger,” said Baili Zongxue. Given the fruits of their labor till now, they were able to win a prize in the top 10.

Hearing that, her teammates agreed with her, so they walked back.

After Gu Ning’s team walked farther away, they met two fifth-level demonic monsters. Even though they didn’t have magic crystals, Gu Ning’s team still had to kill them. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Right when Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were fighting with demonic monsters, Dongfang Ziyu’s team came and stopped.

Seeing that, neither Gu Ning nor Leng Shaoting paid special attention to them. Jing Yunyan was no match for Leng Shaoting, so Dongfang Ziyu was hardly comparable to Leng Shaoting either. In fact, Dongfang Ziyu might not be able to defeat Gu Ning.

Although Mo Qilin was a little unhappy, he said nothing.

“Ziyu, should we…” Wu Shunhua asked Dongfang Ziyu in a low voice. He didn’t finish, but his meaning couldn’t be more obvious. He asked Dongfang Ziyu whether to rob Gu Ning’s team.

“They are very strong and there might not be magic crystals in the demonic monsters, so let’s wait for a while,” said Dongfang Ziyu.

Hearing that, her teammates stopped and watched aside. However, as time went by, they grew displeased because Gu Ning’s team seemed very relaxed when they fought against demonic monsters.

After a short while, Leng Shaoting killed a demonic monster, then Gu Ning did the same thing.

Although they knew there weren’t magic crystals in their bodies, they had to cut their bodies open because Dongfang Ziyu was present.

Dongfang Ziyu and her teammates were amazed by their efficiency because they were extremely fast, at least much faster than them.

Gu Ning was only in the Fusion Stage, but she was able to kill a demonic monster faster than Dongfang Ziyu. Was Gu Ning really only in the Fusion Stage?

If Dongfang Ziyu had a fight against them, she might be the loser.

Luckily her team didn’t rush to steal the demonic monsters from Gu Ning’s team and there was no magic crystal.

In the following hours, Dongfang Ziyu deliberately avoided Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. It wasn’t because she gave up the idea of stealing their magic crystals, but because she clearly knew she didn’t have that ability. Instead, she was worried that Gu Ning’s team might rob them of their magic crystals.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting actually had no intention of robbing Dongfang Ziyu’s team of their magic crystals. After Dongfang Ziyu’s team left, they also walked away deeper into the forest.

They only had an hour and twenty minutes now and they had to collect a few more magic crystals. It would be better if they could run into demonic monsters at higher levels.

There must be magic crystals! If there weren’t, they were unwilling to meet demonic monsters. It was important to put their skills into use, but it was more important to win a prize.

“Senior Qing Feng, Senior Qing He, the demonic monsters are at higher levels as we walk deeper. They’ll be more difficult to deal with,” said Mo Qilin when he saw Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t stop walking farther inside.

He admitted that he was scared, because it was very dangerous deep in the forest.

Although he knew that Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were very strong, they weren’t the strongest cultivators after all, so it would be dangerous as they went deeper.

Even his master didn’t dare to walk too deep in the forest, otherwise his master would have come here to kill demonic monsters and collect high level magic crystals for cultivation.

“If you’re afraid, you don’t need to go inside with me, but you might not be safe even if you stay here. In fact, it’s more dangerous if you stay here alone than if you go inside with us, because there are a lot of fifth-level demonic monsters moving around here. You’re no match for them. If you go with us, at least we can make sure you’ll be safe. We’re determined to go deeper,” said Gu Ning. It sounded a little cold-blooded, but it was the truth.
