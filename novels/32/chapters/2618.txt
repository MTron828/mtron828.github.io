Chapter 2619: Can’t Find Leng Shaoting

Gu Ning did her best to calm down. She comforted Xu Jinchen and herself. Since they knew where Leng Shaoting disappeared, they immediately rushed over to find him.

“Of course.” Xu Jinchen believed them, so he didn’t ask further. He didn’t join them either, because he was unwilling to be a burden on them.

After all, Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao had super powers. They could fly and move much faster than ordinary people. It was impossible for him to keep up with them.

Jing Yunyao and Shangguan Yang had very good hearing, so they heard Gu Ning’s conversation with Xu Jinchen. There was no need for Gu Ning to repeat it.

Afterwards, they immediately went to find Leng Shaoting.

Before they went to find Leng Shaoting, Jing Yunyao said that they should let Jiang Liluo and Si Jin visit the Leng family first. She was suspicious of the Jing family for scheming against Leng Shaoting, so she was worried that the Leng family might be the next target.

When Jiang Liluo and Si Jin heard that Leng Shaoting was in danger, they were anxious too. Without delay, they went to visit the Leng family.

Gu Ning and the others didn’t drive, and instead flew with a sword. It was much faster than a car.

Because Gu Ning wasn’t good at it and Jing Yunyao was slower than Shangguan Yang, Shangguan Yang directly took both of them. Most importantly, Jing Yunyao was in a bad mood now. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Normally, they needed to spend one and a half hours on the road, but this time they arrived after twenty minutes. A flying sword could save a lot of time because it flew in a straight line and was incredibly fast.

After they reached the place where Leng Shaoting stopped his car, they saw that his car was still there.

Because the evil cultivator had gone for a long time, there was no scent of him left, but there were traces of a fierce fight.

Because it was night, the people who saw Leng Shaoting’s car didn’t see the traces, but Shangguan Yang and the others could see clearly at night.

They couldn’t sense the evil cultivator, but they could see that Leng Shaoting must have run into an evil cultivator from the traces left on the ground.

When they learned that Leng Shaoting encountered an evil cultivator who was also at a very high level, Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao were a little scared. Upon thinking about what might have happened to Leng Shaoting, they couldn’t accept it.

Shangguan Yang was no less worried than them, but he could still compose himself.

They could only figure out where Leng Shaoting and the evil cultivator went from the traces of their fight left on the ground.

Although Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao were very anxious and sad, they clearly knew that emotions couldn’t solve any problems. They had to stay clear-minded and focus on searching for Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes and saw the traces farther away from them, so they didn’t need to waste much time. Shangguan Yang and Jing Yunyao followed her.

They chased the traces deep into the mountains, but lost direction afterwards.

“Perhaps they left with flying swords right here, so there are no more traces,” said Shangguan Yang. However, he didn’t seem happy, because they lost their clues. It would be harder for them to find Leng Shaoting.

However, they had to continue.

In the following hours, they separated. Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao were a group, while Shangguan Yang searched alone.

They also flew with their swords and looked for Leng Shoating in all directions.

When they were searching for Leng Shaoting, the evil cultivator was already back in his house. He wasn’t sure whether Leng Shaoting was dead or not, so he was a little displeased.

As for Jing Yunyao, he knew that she would sense that Leng Shaoting was in danger because she was Leng Shaoting’s mother. She would surely go to find Leng Shaoting. If he stayed at the place where he fought against Leng Shaoting, he would be caught by Jing Yunyao.

He was also injured and lost a lot of energy. If he met Jing Yunyao in such a situation, he wouldn’t win. After all, Jing Yunyao was at a high level. Therefore, he decided to go see Jing Yunyao after he recovered.

“How is it?” Once the evil cultivator was back, Senior Mrs. Jing asked him in a hurry. She wanted to know the result right away.

“I found Leng Shaoting and I injured him. He fell into the ocean. I bet it’s hard for him to survive, but there is a flood dragon by his side. I don’t know whether he’ll be saved. Since I didn’t see them come out of the water after searching for them for an hour, I think it’s highly possible that he is dead. Anyway, I didn’t see his body, so I can’t be sure,” said the evil cultivator.

Knowing that Leng Shaoting was seriously injured and fell into the ocean, Senior Mrs. Jing was satisfied, but when she heard about the flood dragon, she was very surprised. “What? A flood dragon?”

She didn’t expect Leng Shaoting to have a flood dragon with him.

“If it hadn’t been for the flood dragon, I would have already killed Leng Shaoting,” said the evil cultivator with hatred.

“How about Jing Yunyao?” Senior Mrs. Jing asked again. In fact, she was mostly curious about the result of Jing Yunyao.

“I haven’t found her yet. I’m already out of strength after injuring Leng Shaoting. I’ll only be killed if I go to see Jing Yunyao now. I need to have a rest first!” said the evil cultivator. “Alright, I’ll take a shower first. I need a good sleep tonight.” He was unwilling to talk more.

The next moment, he went to take a shower, while Senior Mrs. Jing looked displeased.

He needed a good sleep tonight. Did it mean that they wouldn’t have sex later?

Senior Mrs. Jing wasn’t only interested in sex, but she stayed mainly for that!

Because the evil cultivator said that he needed a good sleep tonight, Senior Mrs. Jing said after he walked out of the bathroom, “Well, since you need a good sleep, I’ll sleep in the guest room tonight.”

She sounded unhappy.

The evil cultivator understood what she was thinking, so he said with an evil smile, “What? Can’t you sleep without having sex with me?”

“I didn’t say that…” Senior Mrs. Jing denied it, but it was her real thought.

“Stop lying to my face!” The evil cultivator didn’t hesitate to embarrass her. “Although I do need a good sleep, it isn’t the only way for me to regain energy. I can absorb energy from women as well. So, I’m afraid I’ll be rougher tonight than before. You must be prepared.”

Hearing that, Senior Mrs. Jing flushed and her anger went away.

After that, they started having sex. It was unusually wild this time.

…

At the same time, Gu Ning and the others were still busy searching for Leng Shaoting, but unfortunately they couldn’t find him.
