Chapter 2073: You Won’t Go Back with Empty Hands

Thinking of that, Leng Shaoting turned to look at Gu Ning. Gu Ning hadn’t killed the demonic monster yet, but it wouldn’t be long.

Leng Shaoting didn’t go to help, because it wasn’t necessary, so he walked back with the magic crystal.

The moment Mo Qilin saw it, he exclaimed with great excitement, “Wow, magic crystal! There is a magic crystal! You have unbelievably good luck.”

“Senior Qing Feng, can I have a look?” Mo Qilin looked at Leng Shaoting with anticipation. Although he had seen a magic crystal before, it was very rare, so he was still excited to see it again.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting handed the magic crystal to Mo Qilin right away, then he focused on Gu Ning.

Once Mo Qilin got the magic crystal, he began to observe it.

Gu Ning had also almost killed the demonic monster on the other side, but she didn’t dig its energy center out because there was no magic crystal inside.

Seeing that, Leng Shaoting immediately understood why, so he didn’t ask about it. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Mo Qilin, however, asked Gu Ning when she came back with empty hands, “Senior Qing He, isn’t there a magic crystal in the demonic monster?”

The answer couldn’t be more obvious, but he still couldn’t help asking.

“There isn’t,” said Gu Ning.

Hearing that, Mo Qilin looked disappointed, but he soon accepted it. After all, not every demonic monster had a magic crystal. They just met two and already got one, which was already quite lucky.

“It’s fine, we’ll get more. We got one after meeting only two demonic monsters. We’re very lucky today! I believe we will be luckier later,” Mo Qilin said to comfort Gu Ning, although he was actually the one who felt disappointed here. Gu Ning was amused by his reaction.

Saying that, Mo Qilin returned the magic crystal to Leng Shaoting. He wanted it badly, but it was Leng Shaoting’s, so he wouldn’t take it. Even if he wanted to do that, he didn’t have the abilities to make it happen.

“Yeah, we’ll have more. Don’t worry, since you came with us, we won’t let you leave with empty hands,” said Gu Ning.

“Really?” Mo Qilin rounded his eyes in surprise. He didn’t expect to win a prize, but it was better to leave with several magical crystals than nothing.

“Of course,” Gu Nings said.

“Thanks, Senior Qing He.” Mo Qilin thanked her at once. He didn’t forget Leng Shaoting, so he turned to thank Leng Shaoting the next second. “Thank you, Senior Qing Feng.”

Afterwards, they continued to walk ahead.

In half an hour, they met three other demonic monsters, but none of them had a magic crystal.

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning stayed calm, while Mo Qilin was slightly worried.

Luckily, they soon met a low level demonic monster with a magic crystal, so Gu Ning told Mo Qilin to kill it on his own.

Given Mo Qilin’s level, he should be able to do that.

Without hesitation, Mo Qilin went to attack the demonic monster, and about ten minutes later, he killed the demonic monster after losing a lot of strength. Anyway, he wasn’t injured.

Although Mo Qilin didn’t think there would be a magic crystal in the demonic monster, he still needed to cut it open to make sure of it.

When Mo Qilin cut the demonic monster’s body open, he saw a white magic crystal and got excited in an instant.

“Magic crystal. There is a magic crystal!”

The magic crystal was only at the first level, the lowest level, which wasn’t much helpful for his cultivation, but Mo Qilin was still filled with happiness and a strong sense of achievement because he killed this demonic monster.

Because Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning already knew it, they didn’t have much of a reaction.

Mo Qilin took the magic crystal out. After hesitating for a second, he took the magic crystal towards Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning. “Senior Qing He, this magic crystal…” He gave it to Gu Ning.

Mo Qilin was going to give this magic crystal to Gu Ning. Even though he was the one who killed the demonic monster, Gu Ning gave him the chance after all.

“This is the magic crystal you got by yourself. You don’t need to give it to me. Take it yourself.” Gu Ning understood Mo Qilin’s meaning, but she gave Mo Qilin the chance to kill the demonic monster in order to let him keep the magic crystal.

“Really?” Mo Qilin showed happiness, but he asked with uncertainty.

“Have I ever lied to you?” asked Gu Ning with a raised eyebrow.

“Absolutely not.” Mo Qilin answered right away. Since Gu Ning was willing to give it to him, he accepted her kindness. “If so, thank you, Senior Qing He.”

Therefore, Mo Qilin took the magic crystal.

…

Dongfang Ziyu and Jing Yunyan also ran into many demonic monsters, and had killed a lot of them, but unfortunately they hadn’t found any magic crystals yet.

They were at a high level, so they still had a lot of strength even if they had killed many demonic monsters. In addition, it only took a little strength to kill low level demonic monsters.

Meanwhile, participants who were at comparatively low levels began to lose strength after killing several demonic monsters.

At this moment, it was very dangerous if they lacked strength. It would be fine if they encountered low level demonic monsters, but they could be seriously injured if they ran into middle level demonic monsters. As a result, they didn’t go deeper in the forest before they regained their strength.

Baili Zongxue had good luck. After killing seven demonic monsters, she finally got a first-level magic crystal.

She killed the demonic monster with the magic crystal, and her teammates were all from the Baili family, so no one competed against her for it.

…

Gu Ning and her teammates went deeper into the forest, because they were ambitious to get more higher level magic crystals.

In about half an hour, Gu Ning and her teammates met three other demonic monsters. Fortunately, one of them had a magic crystal.

Since both Leng Shaoting and Mo Qilin had a magic crystal now, Gu Ning was going to deal with the demonic monster this time. Accordingly, she took the magic crystal.

It was a second-level magic crystal.

Although Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting both had a second-level magic crystal, while Mo Qilin had a first-level magic crystal, Mo Qilin didn’t feel it was unfair. He wouldn’t be displeased even if it was his only magic crystal after the game was over.

It only took Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting two or three minutes to kill a second-level demonic monster, but Mo Qilin had to fight for fifteen minutes to kill it. It took five minutes longer than before and he lost more strength as well. After all, a second-level demonic monster was harder to deal with than a first-level one.

When Mo Qilin wasn’t in danger, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting wouldn’t help him because he needed to practice his skills.

After Mo Qilin lost much of his strength, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were concerned about his condition and gave him enough time to rest. They didn’t go deeper until he recovered.
