Chapter 507 Back to City F

Gu Ning had provided those pictures for Let’s Gossip Official, but they didn’t care who the provider was as long as the material was shocking enough.

The slander was finally solved and Gu Ning as well as her staff went back to work on the film.

In fact, it was the semester when they were about to write the entrance examination to college, and Gu Ning felt bad because she had occupied some crucial time of Chu Peihan, Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping. Therefore, Gu Ning got the textbooks and gave them lessons once they were free.

Chu Peihan, Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping actually had the idea to escape from the stressful semester by helping Gu Ning. Unexpectedly, they still had to learn under pressure from Gu Ning. They were going to attend universities soon, so it was better for them to seize the time and study hard. In addition, Gu Ning was a great teacher. Chu Peihan was good at studying and Hao Ran as well as Zhang Tianping were smart too, so it wasn’t hard for them to learn.

They had shot the parts of the real antiques for four days, so Gu Ning secretly put the real antiques back to the telepathic eye space later.

Chu Peihan and the others needed to stay here for another week but Gu Ning had to leave now, because Tang Yunfan was going to City F. Gu Ning wasn’t willing to let Gu Man face it alone, so she had to leave for City F.

Before she left, she settled the bill for Chu Peihan, Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping’s rooms in the hotel. And the large bus would be driven by Hao Ran. When their parts were over, Gu Ning would pick them up.

It was around five pm when Gu Ning arrived at City F, but she didn’t go back home at once. Instead, she went to Lan Yubin’s place.

Lan Yubin’s son, Lan Tianhua, had already fully recovered, and Lan Yubin had called Gu Ning a few days earlier to invite her to share a meal with his family in order to thank her. Although Lan Yubin had already paid a lot for the pills, he didn’t think that money was enough to show their appreciation.

Gu Ning had declined but Lan Yubin insisted, so she agreed in the end. She would be occupied tomorrow, so she decided to visit them today. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

When Gu Ning arrived, Lan Yubin and his wife welcomed her with open arms and repeatedly thanked her.

“Oh, Miss Gu, I have several friends who keep calling me wanting to buy your pills,” Lan Yubin said to Gu Ning while they were chatting.

“I’m willing to sell the pills, but not easily. I won’t sell them unless the disease can’t be cured by doctors, because the number of the pills is limited,” Gu Ning said seriously. Although she had plenty of pills, the number was limited, and she also needed them to make medicines and make-up.

Hearing that, Lan Yubin thought that it was reasonable. Those rich people didn’t actually have any serious diseases, but they wanted to prepare some in case they needed them in the future. In that case, Gu Ning was unwilling to sell the pills to them, because she didn’t lack money at all. In addition, she had rescued many people with her pills and never asked them to pay.

After the meal, Gu Ning went back home.

When she got home, Gu Man was absent, but Gu Qing was at her home. Gu Ning asked Gu Qing where her mother was. It turned out that Gu Man went to visit Wang Sufen. However, it was almost 8 pm, and Gu Ning was worried about Gu Man’s safety, so she called her at once.

When Gu Man answered Gu Ning’s call, Gu Ning heard the sounds of a man’s swearing and a woman’s crying. She recognized that the woman was Wang Sufen.

Gu Ning frowned a little. Obviously, something unpleasant was going on there, and she was worried about Gu Man.

“Ningning, are you home now?” Gu Man asked.

Gu Ning had told Gu Man that she was going to visit Lan Yubin first, so Gu Man assumed that she could be home now.

“Yes! Mom, where are you now? What is happening there?” Gu Ning asked.

“I’m in Wang Sufen’s place. You can come and pick me up,” Gu Man said, then told Gu Ning the address. Normally, Gu Man wouldn’t bother getting Gu Ning to pick her up. If she did so, there had to be trouble.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya were in other cities, so the car was parked in the parking lot.

Once Gu Ning left her home, she ran to the parking lot. She drove the car as fast as she could to meet Gu Man.

Around 10 minutes later, Gu Ning arrived at Wang Sufen’s place. It was an old, damaged street, and many onlookers were standing outside of Wang Sufen’s home which was a small two-story self-built building.

Because the sound insulation of the house wasn’t good and the man deliberately raised his voice, their quarrel was easily heard.

“Wang Sufen, you’ve been married to me for over a dozen years. You can’t give birth to a boy, and you even dare to cheat on me?” the man was almost yelling. It seemed like he intended to let more people hear it. Generally speaking, people were inclined to hide their shameful secrets, but the man did the opposite.

Gu Ning didn’t know whether what the man had said was true, but she thought that it wasn’t highly likely. Instead, she believed that the man did it on purpose to gain an advantage in the divorce.

No matter what, Gu Ning wouldn’t jump to conclusions. When she walked to the door, she used her Jade Eyes to see what was happening inside. In the living room, Gu Man put her arm around Wang Sufen’s shoulders where they were sitting together on the sofa. Wang Sufen was trembling, sobbing, while Gu Man seemed extremely displeased.

Opposite them, a man was glaring at Wang Sufen.

“Yang Dazhi, Sufen has already agreed to the divorce. Do you have to swear at her all the time? My daughter is coming to pick us up soon!” Gu Man said.

Facing Yang Dazhi, Gu Man was a little scared but she did her best to defend her friend, Wang Sufen.
