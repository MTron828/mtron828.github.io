Chapter 837: Most Importantly, Shaoting Likes Her

Many actors who ached to become a hot topic felt quite upset because Goddess Gu frequently occupied people’s attention. At the same time, they were also amazed by her outstanding ability.

When they had enough fun, Gu Ning, Zhang Zikai, and Su Anya left together.

On the way out, Zhang Zikai and Su Anya became the focus of people’s attention, because both of them were carrying a large doll the size of themselves.

“Honey, I want a doll of that size as well!” a girl said to her boyfriend.

“Why do you want such a large doll?” her boyfriend asked.

“I can sleep with it in my arms!” the girl said.

“You can also fall asleep hugging me,” her boyfriend said.

The young couple showed off their affection towards each other.

“Although I’m single, I have dolls!” Su Anya said with annoyance. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I have dolls too!” Zhang Zikai agreed.

Gu Ning smiled, then said to herself that she had Leng Shaoting. However, Leng Shaoting hadn’t contacted her for a long time, and she didn’t know how his task was going now. She cared about him, but she knew that she couldn’t ask for details about his task because it was highly confidential.

To Gu Ning’s surprise, Leng Shaoting finally called her when she drove back to the hotel.

Leng Shaoting told her that he was free now and asked her where she was.

Gu Ning told him that she was driving her friends back to Bluesky Hotel, and Leng Shaoting said that he could come to pick her up. Gu Ning agreed.

It was 20 minutes away from 9 pm when they arrived at the hotel, Gu Ning didn’t walk Zhang Zikai and Su Anya to their rooms, but went to return the car before she waited for Leng Shaoting in the hall.

Seeing both Zhang Zikai and Su Anya walking back with a large doll in their arms, girls around them all felt envious and kept glancing at them.

When Zhang Zikai went to see her teacher with the large doll, her teacher asked with dissatisfaction, “Why did you buy such a big doll? Don’t you know that it isn’t convenient to bring it back?”

“I didn’t buy it myself; Goddess Gu won it at darts!” Zhang Zikai said.

Won it at darts? Her teacher was surprised. He knew the rules of darts. If one wanted to win the doll, he or she must hit the red spot with all the darts.

Gu Ning was so amazing!

The teacher only knew that Gu Ning was a successful businesswoman, and wasn’t aware that she had saved many people’s lives, otherwise he would be more than shocked.

After meeting her teacher, Zhang Zikai went back to her room. She stayed in the same room as Song Siyao. Even though they didn’t get along, they were the only two girls who came from the capital, so they had to stay together.

Song Siyao was doing math in the room at this moment. She was arrogant and self-centered, but she was also good at studying, especially math. She was one of the representatives of the capital after all.

Song Siyao was struck dumb for a second the second Zhang Zikai walked inside with a large doll. “Why do you still like dolls at your age?” she said with disdain. However, she actually also liked dolls.

Zhang Zikai ignored her, then did her own things. Song Siyao closed her mouth too.

...

Gu Ning had waited in the hall for around 10 minutes when Leng Shaoting arrived.

Seeing Leng Shaoting coming alone, Gu Ning casually asked, “Why are you here alone? Where are they?”

“Oh, they went to deal with their own things,” Leng Shaoting said.

Gu Ning understood that Xin Bei must leave to meet Cao Wenxin, and Xu Jinchen must have been abandoned by Leng Shaoting.

Thinking of that, Gu Ning had sympathy for Xu Jinchen.

...

Having been abandoned by his close brothers, Xu Jinchen felt quite sad, but he still had to go back to the hotel alone.

He wasn’t willing to stay in the hotel alone, so he first went to change in his room, then went to meet with his friends for a drink. However, he ran into a familiar face at the door of the clubhouse.

“Hi!” Zi Beiying was surprised to see Xu Jinchen. She was surprised, not because Xu Jinchen was here, but because Leng Shaoting must be here if Xu Jinchen showed up.

“Hi, Miss Zi!” Xu Jinchen was also surprised to meet Zi Beiying in City B. It was a pure coincidence that Zi Beiying visited City B.

“My friends are in City B, so I came here to visit them,” Zi Beiying said, then asked, “Where is Shaoting?”

“He left for a date,” Xu Jinchen said.

“What? A date? He already has a girlfriend?” Zi Beiying was shocked to hear the news.

“Yeah,” Xu Jinchen said.

“What’s his girlfriend like? Is she beautiful?” Zi Beiying asked at once. She hoped that Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend wasn’t better than her.

“She’s gorgeous and kind. Most importantly, Shaoting likes her,” Xu Jinchen said.

Zi Beiying was heart-broken when she heard that. It seemed that Leng Shaoting had already found his love. She was confident that she was an outstanding girl as to her appearance and ability, but Leng Shaoting had never paid much attention to her, which was very upsetting.

Xu Jinchen didn’t mean to disappoint Zi Beiying, but it was the truth.

“What are you going to do now?” Zi Beiying asked Xu Jinchen.

“To drink with my friends,” Xu Jinchen replied.

“I’ll join you.” Zi Beiying was in a bad mood now, so she also wanted to drown her sorrows.
