Chapter 456 Su Tongnuo

After ordering, Gu Ning said to Su Tongnuo, “Miss Su, Wenxin told me something about you awhile ago, so I asked her more for details. I think that you’re a great actress and I’d like to sign you. If you’re willing to work for me, I can help you end your contract with Feiteng Entertainment. And I can promise you that there are no unspoken rules in my company. You don’t need to serve the clients for a job. As long as you’re hard-working and loyal to my company, I’ll pay you well. As for my company, I will be honest with you. It’s already registered, but is still being redecorated, so it’s risky if you follow my lead. It all depends on you, and whether you have the courage and ambition to build your career.”

No unspoken rules, and didn’t have to serve those disgusting fat men just for a job. That was exactly what Su Tongnuo dreamed for. She didn’t really care about the future of Gu Ning’s company right now, because she couldn’t wait to get rid of Feiteng, and she was brave enough to set out on an adventurous journey.

Therefore, Su Tongnuo agreed without hesitation. “Miss Gu, I’m willing to follow your lead, because my situation couldn’t be worse. I’ll also work hard as a skillful actress, and be loyal to the company, but...” Although Su Tongnuo was eager to get rid of Feiteng, she felt uneasy when she thought of the influential figure she had annoyed. “The person who shut me out is the son of the vice director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau.”

This was the capital. Without the government’s support, let alone Feiteng Entertainment which wasn’t very large, even the largest entertainment company couldn’t run their business in this place. Power overshadowed capital in this country.

“Don’t worry. I can handle it,” Gu Ning said with confidence.

Since Gu Ning said so, Su Tongnuo chose to believe it, not because of Gu Ning, but because of the power behind Gu Ning. Gu Ning was too young, so Su Tongnuo thought that there had to be someone with a high position supporting her behind the scenes.

“Oh, would you please help me end the contract my assistant has with Feiteng too? She’s very nice, and I want to continue to work with her,” Su Tongnuo said.

“No problem.” Gu Ning didn’t care. Since Su Tongnuo already had her favorite assistant, Gu Ning could save some effort in having to help her find one.

“Thank you so much,” Su Tongnuo said.

“Alright, I’ll go to Feiteng Entertainment tomorrow around 9:30 am. My company is called Fenghua Entertainment, and you’re the third person I’ve hired till now. Welcome to joining us!” Gu Ning said and reached out her hand to shake with Su Tongnuo.

Su Tongnuo ached to leave Feiteng Entertainment, so it wasn’t a difficult decision for her to cooperate with Gu Ning. However, they could only sign the contract after Su Tongnuo’s agreement with Feiteng Entertainment was ended.

They didn’t stay there for too long, and separated after a short while.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting drove Cao Wenxin back to the hotel before they went back to their house. It was still early, so Leng Shaoting hugged Gu Ning while lying on the sofa watching TV.

“Shaoting, what are the companies that you have?” Gu Ning asked. She only knew about Shengshi Security Company. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Gu Ning was finally interested in knowing more about him, so Leng Shaoting was very happy. “I don’t know actually, because I’ve hired other people to manage them for me. The name of my corporation is the Shengshi Group.”

Leng Shaoting’s corporation was called Shengshi Group, so he thought that he and Gu Ning were meant to be together when Gu Ning told him that her corporation was named Shengning Group.

“Shengshi Group?” Gu Ning was shocked. She had heard of the internationally famous Shengshi Group with over hundreds of billions of yuan in assets. To her astonishment, Leng Shaoting alone was as affluent as a country!

Gu Ning stared at Leng Shaoting coming on to him and said gently, “I didn’t expect you’re so unbelievably rich! I don’t think I need to work at all.”

Gu Ning was joking, but Leng Shaoting was turned on at once. He pressed her to his chest. “Sure, but you need to satisfy me first.” After saying that, he kissed her.

Gu Ning was surprised that he was so horny. Leng Shaoting, on the other hand, couldn’t get enough from Gu Ning. The two had rounds of wild love making on the sofa afterwards.

Gu Ning didn’t wake up until 8 o’clock the next morning because she had “worked out” so hard last night. Leng Shaoting had already prepared breakfast for her by the time she got out of bed. After breakfast, Gu Ning made a copy of what K had sent to her in the e-mail.

Seeing the document, Leng Shaoting asked, “Do you need my help?”.

“Thanks, but I can handle it,” Gu Ning said. “I can’t rely on you all the time. I need to practice and learn how to deal with my own business.”

Leng Shaoting didn’t insist, but said, “Call me whenever you need me.”

“I will,” Gu Ning said, then she put the document into her backpack. “Let’s go!”

Su Tongnuo arrived at the company before 9 am. Although she had already been shut out of the industry, she still had to go to work as usual except on weekends. She had nothing to do, but just sat there. Other actors in the company would make fun of her when they were free.

“Look, Tongnuo is coming to work so early!” a female voice said sarcastically behind Su Tongnuo. After that, a stylish woman walked inside, followed by several men, like she was the queen. The woman looked at Su Tongnuo with obvious arrogance, and the people who followed her also stared at Su Tongnuo with disdain.

The woman was Li Jiayue, who was also an actress in Feiteng Entertainment. She had been signed by Feiteng at the same time as Su Tongnuo. However, Su Tongnuo was a better actress than her, so Li Jiayue didn’t have many chances and hated Su Tongnuo very much. She admitted that she wasn’t as pretty or skillful as Su Tongnuo, but she didn’t think she should be ignored because of Su Tongnuo.

Ever since Su Tongnuo had been shut out of the industry after she had refused to accept the unspoken rules, Li Jiayue finally had the chance to become famous by doing what Su Tongnuo didn’t want to do.
