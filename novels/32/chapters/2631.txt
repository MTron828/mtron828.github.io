Chapter 2634: Can’t Get in

“Yeah, I’m Kun. May I know your name?” Kun asked like a gentleman.

“Um, can we talk privately? Don’t worry, I won’t waste much of your time,” said Gu Ning sincerely. It seemed to be an emergency.

“Sure!” Kun didn’t refuse. After that, he followed Gu Ning away from the crowd to a corner.

“Miss, what is it? Can you tell me now?” asked Kun with the attitude of a gentleman.

“I came to tell you that you have very bad luck. After seeing me, your life is over,” said Gu Ning coldly.

Hearing that, Kun squinted. However, he didn’t take Gu Ning’s words seriously. He laughed loudly as if he just heard a joke. “Young girl, do you think you can do anything to me?”

Because Gu Ning didn’t have the aura of a cultivator, Kun thought that she was an undercover agent and came to catch him!

If she was sent by the police, he couldn’t care less.

“We’ll see!” Gu Ning said with a smile, then immediately attacked Kun.

Once she used her magical energy, her level as a cultivator was revealed, amazing Kun.

It was beyond his imagination that this girl, who had no aura of a cultivator turned out to be one.

Kun was extremely surprised, but he wasn’t scared, because Gu Ning didn’t seem to be very strong.

Unfortunately, after he started fighting her, he realized that her real abilities were much better than her level and he was soon at a disadvantage.

......

Security guards in the club noticed their fight and hurriedly rushed over to stop them.

By this time, Kun had noticed that Gu Ning was strong, so he wanted to run away and jump over the wall at once.

Witnessing the scene, the security guards were all astonished. Jesus, what did they just see? The man just jumped over the wall so easily. Was it qinggong from swordsmen novels?

The next moment, they were surprised again, because Gu Ning did the same thing. With an easy jump, she quickly got over the wall.

Instantly, the security guards found the world too unbelievable.

“Oh my, they just jumped over just like that. This wall is two meters high! Even if they’re good at jumping, shouldn’t they run several meters before getting over it? It seems too easy for them.”

“Right, I can’t believe my eyes. Are they kung fu masters?”

“You must have watched too many TV shows.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Then how to explain their behavior?”

“No idea, let’s report it to the manager!”

They all agreed on that, so they immediately went to report it.

Actually, they only witnessed Gu Ning and Kun jump over the wall. If they saw how fast they moved on the walls, they would be even more amazed.

Nevertheless, they didn’t see it.

…

Before long, Gu Ning caught up with Kun. Because there weren’t many people around the club, there was nothing for Gu Ning to be worried about so she directly attacked him.

However, although there weren’t people around, there were different blocks, so Gu Ning forced Kun to a remote area.

After all, they were going to have a violent fight so they might cause a lot of damage.

Kun wanted to run to a crowded place, because it would be more convenient for him to escape, but unfortunately, there was no way out. He was forced to go where Gu Ning wanted.

Kun didn’t want to accept this, but he was left with no choice.

After Kun found out that Gu Ning was a cultivator, he didn’t bother to ask her why she attacked him, because good cultivators and evil cultivators were bitter enemies.

Whenever they met good cultivators, they would attack them too. They would only control themselves if they knew that they couldn’t win.

There were mountains behind the club, so Kun was soon forced into them. Gu Ning observed for a while, and saw nobody there. There weren’t surveillance cameras either, so she let the white flood dragon out.

When Kun saw the white flood dragon, he was shocked. He wasn’t surprised by the existence of the flood dragon, but that there was a flood dragon by Gu Ning’s side.

“White, kill him!” said Gu Ning.

Hearing that, White immediately went to attack Kun.

If White could absorb Kun’s energy, it would become stronger. After all, flood dragons were monsters so evil cultivators’ energy wouldn’t hurt them.

Kun was no match for White, so he lost within ten minutes and White absorbed all of his energy.

Finally, Kun was killed.

From the beginning to the end, the battle lasted about twenty minutes. It wasn’t long, nor was it too quick.

After killing Kun, Gu Ning put White into her telepathic eye space again. Then she took out the black jade pendant. She damaged it with her magical energy before going back to the club.

As soon as Gu Ning entered the club, she was stopped by a security guard. “Sorry, miss, because you just had a fight here. You aren’t allowed into our club right now.”

Although the security guard was surprised by Gu Ning’s skills and admired her, he had to listen to their manager’s order.

“I know it’s my fault that I had a fight with the man in your club, but the man is a criminal wanted by the police. I did it out of a sense of justice. I’m sorry I didn’t have time to choose a better place. Please forgive me. If not, I’ll just leave,” said Gu Ning. If she wasn’t allowed in, she wouldn’t insist. She didn’t want to make it difficult for the security guard.

After all, she indeed caused them trouble. Even though it didn’t have a big impact, it was understandable that the security guard didn’t want her to cause more trouble by stopping her outside.

However, she would have to leave Chen Jialin alone then.

Upon hearing Gu Ning’s explanation, the security guard admired Gu Ning more than ever. He felt embarrassed to stop her again, but couldn’t let her in without permission.

“Please wait for a while, I’ll go to ask our manager,” said the security guard.

“Sure.” Gu Ning replied.

After the security guard went inside, he found their manager and told him what Gu Ning said. The manager was considerate so he didn’t stop Gu Ning from going inside again.

When Gu Ning walked in, the manager saw her and was shocked. He didn’t expect the person to be Gu Ning.
