Chapter 2325: Who Do You Choose?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Leng Shaoting shouted as he looked for Gu Ning. Because it was a misty forest with poor visibility, it was hard for him to see anything with his eyes.

In addition to shouts, Leng Shaoting also used his senses to search for Gu Ning. However, after a few hours, he still couldn’t find Gu Ning, nor could he walk out of the misty forest. Leng Shaoting became more anxious. He didn’t know whether Gu Ning was safe.

After looking for Gu Ning for a while longer, Leng Shaoting heard noises of a fight. Therefore, he quickly went there.

When he was closer, he saw two women in a fight. One of them was Gu Ning.

However, Gu Ning was no match for the other woman and was beaten back step by step.

“Ningning!” The second Leng Shaoting saw Gu Ning, his eyes lit up. He immediately ran to Gu Ning to help her and used his magical energy to hit the woman who was fighting against Gu Ning.

Once Leng Shaoting took action, the woman who was in the fight with Gu Ning couldn’t fight back. She was hit by Leng Shaoting’s magical energy and flew a few meters away till she fell on the ground.

The woman turned to look at Leng Shaoting in shock. She sadly criticized him. “Shaoting, how could you hurt me for her?”

Hearing her criticism, Leng Shaoting frowned in confusion, because her tone and expression closely resembled Gu Ning’s. However, her face and voice were totally strange to him. He didn’t think he had met her before! Why did he feel that she looked like Gu Ning?

“Shaoting, you’re finally here!” Gu Ning who stood next to Leng Shaoting said happily.

Upon hearing Gu Ning’s voice, Leng Shaoting came back to his senses. He was eager to see whether Gu Ning was injured, so he ignored that woman.

The woman who was injured by Leng Shaoting was Tang Aining. In other words, Tang Aining had a fight with Gu Ning, appearing in Leng Shaoting’s illusion. It was a test for him. It had nothing to do with the real Gu Ning, because it was all fake images in the illusion.

Normally, people and things that you cared about most would show up in the illusion, and you had to choose.

“Ningning, are you alright?” Leng Shaoting asked with concern.

“I’m fine,” said Gu Ning.

“Great.” Leng Shaoting felt relieved.

“Shaoting, let’s go now!” Gu Ning pulled Leng Shaoting and wanted to leave. She didn’t bother to punish Tang Aining.

“Wait!” Tang Aining, however, wouldn’t let them go. She stood up and stared at Leng Shaoting with a sad expression. “Shaoting, I’m the real Gu Ning. She is fake.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting frowned, because that woman didn’t look or sound like Gu Ning at all. However, Leng Shaoting somehow felt there was a close similarity between Gu Ning and her.

At the same time, he had a strange feeling when Gu Ning held his hand.

Anyway, the feelings didn’t last long, and he forbade himself from thinking like that. Ningning by his side now! Therefore, Leng Shaoting turned to look at Tang Aining coldly. “Miss, I’m not blind. I can recognize my fiancée.”

“No, she’s fake! I’m the real one,” said Tang Aining.

“Tang Aining, enough! You tried to possess my body in order to be alive again. It’s so selfish,” said Gu Ning angrily. She seemed very mad and hurt.

Tang Aining?

Leng Shaoting had heard of that name. He knew that she was Tang Bingsen’s daughter and Gu Ning’s master.

Did she try to rob Gu Ning of her body in order to come alive?

In an instant, Leng Shaoting was mad at Tang Aining.

As a cultivator, he wasn’t surprised that a person became a ghost after she died and wanted to possess someone else’s body. It could happen.

“Gu Ning, you know that you’re already dead. If I hadn’t been reincarnated into your body, your body would have been rotten long ago. You wouldn’t be able to meet Shaoting!” Tang Aining sneered.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was struck dumb.

What? Gu Ning was already dead before meeting him? After Tang Aining died, her soul possessed Gu Ning’s body?

Although Leng Shaoting wasn’t fully convinced by Tang Aining’s words, he couldn’t help but take it seriously.

“So what? Since your soul has left my body, it means you shouldn’t stay in my body any longer. You should leave me now. This is my body, and I’m Gu Ning.” Gu Ning admitted that what Tang Aining just said was true.

Because even Gu Ning admitted it now, Leng Shaoting suddenly didn’t know what to do. Without a word, he gave a glance at Gu Ning, then at Tang Aining.

“Shaoting, you can only choose one of us. Will you choose her or me?” Gu Ning asked Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting hesitated, because they were both Gu Ning no matter if one had her body while the other had her soul. It was a very difficult choice.

“Shaoting, I’m the one who’s been in love with you for over a year. Will you leave me just because I have a different appearance now?” Tang Aining asked.

“Of course not!” said Leng Shaoting subconsciously. He loved Gu Ning not for her beautiful appearance.

Gu Ning interrupted. “How about me? My body has been with you for more than a year as well. Will you abandon me?”

“No, I won’t,” said Leng Shaoting. Although he was cornered now, he couldn’t abandon Gu Ning, or he would be irresponsible.

What should he do now?

“Who will you choose between us?”

Gu Ning and Tang Aining asked him at the same time.

“I…”

Leng Shaoting didn’t want to say, because it was really hard.

It wasn’t realistic for him to take both of them away. He couldn’t accept that, and they wouldn’t be willing to do that either.

“Tell us, who will you choose?”

“Say it!”

Leng Shaoting was cornered. In the end, he replied. “If it’s possible, I only want to go back to my life before I entered the barrier. I only want Gu Ning with both her body and soul. Only when her soul is in her body is she the girl I love.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Upon hearing that, Gu Ning and Tang Aining shut their mouths, then their bodies disappeared in the air.

Seeing that, Leng Shaoting was scared. “Ningning!”

He searched around in anxiety, but couldn’t find Gu Ning and Tang Aining.. Finally, he realized something wasn’t right.
