963 Make Yourself a Female

Gu Ning also noticed what Yao Feier had done, but she didn’t mind since Yao Feier was drunk.

Leng Shaoting sat in the driver’s seat, and let Gu Ning move to the front passenger’s seat. He would drive if he was with Gu Ning.

“Where do you want to have food?” Leng Shaoting asked her.

“Let’s go to the Huangdeng Hotel. I need to meet Hao Ran and the others first, then we can go to have some delicious food,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure.” Leng Shaoting started the car and headed to the Huangdeng Hotel.

Both Shengshi Hotel and the Huangdeng Hotel were international five-star hotels, so they had the best locations downtown. Moreover, there was only a short distance of several hundred meters between them. Within two minutes, they arrived at the Huangdeng Hotel.

Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting to wait for her in the car, and that she would be back soon. She was afraid that her friends might feel uneasy if Leng Shaoting showed up with her.

Hao Ran and the boys were scared of Leng Shaoting. If Leng Shaoting was present, they probably wouldn’t dare to say a word.

Hao Ran and the others already gathered in a room waiting for Gu Ning. In fact, they had nothing special to tell Gu Ning, but they hadn’t seen each other for a long time.

“Hi, boss, been a while! I need a big hug!” Chu Peihan jumped out once Gu Ning appeared in her sight.

“Me too!” Su Anya also ran towards Gu Ning with her arms wide open.

Gu Ning was amused, but enjoyed it.

Yu Mixi felt a little shy, so she stood still until Gu Ning walked to her.

“I’m envious of you girls. You can hug each other as you like,” Qin Zixun said.

“Why don’t you make yourself a female?” Chu Peihan joked.

“Come on, do it!” the others said with one accord.

“How dare you!” Qin Zixun pretended to be mad. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Ha-ha, ha-ha.” They laughed out loud.

“If you can make yourself a girl, you can hug other girls as you like. I don’t think there is anything wrong with that,” Chu Peihan added.

Hearing that, Qin Zixun rolled his eyes at her.

“Oh, where is Hao Ran?” Gu Ning asked.

“He left to meet his mother,” Mu Ke said.

Mrs. Hao was aware that Hao Ran was going to City B too, and she had told him to fly there along with her, but Hao Ran insisted on leaving for City B with his friends.

“I’m back!” Right at this moment, they heard Hao Ran’s voice coming from outside. The next second, he dashed into the room. “Hey, boss!”

“Isn’t it too fast for your mother to find her Mr. Right after staying in City B for such a short time?” Hao Ran asked Gu Ning with surprise.

Actually, they had a burning curiosity when Gu Ning told them the news on the phone.

“Well, it’s understandable if one meets his or her love, but does your step-father treat you well? Does he have any children?” Before Gu Ning could say anything, Chu Peihan asked her.

They thought that the man Gu Man was going to marry must have married before given his age. And it was rare to see a kind step-mother or step-father, so they were worried about Gu Ning. One could never be too careful.

“Oh, how’s your step-father’s financial condition? Did he marry your mother for her money?” Qin Zixun asked. He wasn’t being mean, but it could happen in real life, and it had happened many times before.

Gu Ning understood that they cared about her, although their questions sounded a little unkind, so she wasn’t displeased at all.

“Don’t worry about me. My father treats me very well, and he comes from a super-rich family. Most importantly, he isn’t my step-father, but my biological father. He was caught in a car accident 19 years ago, and just got his memory back,” Gu Ning said with a smile.

“What? He’s your biological father?” Hearing that, everyone was shocked.

“How rich is he?”

“Well, much richer than me. I’m barely comparable to him, and he always shares good things with me and my mother,” Gu Ning said.

“Alright, it’s very late now, and I’ve gotta go. Have a good sleep tonight, Qiao Ya will come to pick you up tomorrow around 7 am.” Gu Ning checked the time.

The wedding feast would be held in this hotel, but Gu Ning should bring them with her tomorrow.

“See you tomorrow!”

Although they still had many questions they wanted to ask Gu Ning, they knew that she must be busy preparing for Gu Man’s wedding.

After that, Gu Ning left. She had only stayed in the room with them for a dozen minutes.

When she got back in the car, Leng Shaoting drove her to the night snack street.

“Please send me back to Huafu Hills after having night snacks, and then you can go back to the hotel. Come to my place at 7 am tomorrow,” Gu Ning said.

There was no more room for Leng Shaoting in her house in Huafu Hills, so Gu Ning couldn’t let him stay in her house.

“No problem.” Leng Shaoting nodded.
