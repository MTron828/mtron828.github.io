Chapter 2394: Really Dumb or Acting Dumb?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“What’s wrong with my position?” Yang Mingzhi didn’t understand what Gu Qinyang was implying. He only heard irony in Gu Qinyang’s words, so he was displeased.

The two men who were with Yang Mingzhi, however, figured it out. Although they didn’t know Tang Yunfan’s importance, they bet that he must have a high status. Therefore, they were unwilling to mess with him and decided to persuade Yang Mingzhi to give up.

“Director Yang, forget it. I think you should stop embarrassing yourself.”

“Right!”

“Forget it? No way! I was humiliated publicly!” Yang Mingzhi refused to give up, as if he was aggrieved.

“Humiliated? You can feel humiliated? I thought you’re too shameless to have that feeling.” Tang Yunfan laughed at him. Even if he had seen shameless people before, he was still surprised by Yang Mingzhi’s shameless behavior at this time.

“What do you mean?” Yang Mingzhi questioned angrily.

“I mean what I said. You should earn respect by yourself, but you’re embarrassing yourself instead. You even blame other people for it. I can see how shameless you are,” said Tang Yunfan.

“You’re the shameless one here!” Yang Mingzhi argued.

“Alright, I have no patience with you now. Let me put it frankly, I’m Tang Yunfan, the owner of this hotel,” said Tang Yunfan, then he meaningfully stared at Yang Mingzhi. He wanted to see what Yang Mingzhi would say next.

Tang Yunfan wasn’t tolerant. Even though Yang Mingzhi didn’t break the law, he wouldn’t be polite to him if he dared to annoy him.

Tang Yunfan never liked bullying other people with his influence, but he wouldn’t hesitate to pay bullies back.

“What?” Yang Mingzhi was shocked. Tang Yunfan? The owner of this hotel?

He had definitely heard of Tang Yunfan who wasn’t only the owner of this hotel, but was also the chairman of the Tanghuang Organization and a member of the Tang family in City B.

Yang Mingzhi was stunned. He didn’t expect Tang Yunfan to be Gu Qinyang’s brother-in-law.

How was it possible? Given what he knew, Gu Qinyang’s family was very ordinary. Gu Qinyang had two sisters. One married a blue-collar worker, while the other was a single mother with a daughter.

If Tang Yunfan was Gu Qinyang’s brother-in-law, Tang Yunfan must have married Gu Qinyang’s sister. However, it was impossible for Tang Yunfan to fall in love with a poor, single mother!

Yang Mingzhi, his friends and the onlookers were very surprised.

The onlookers didn’t know Gu Qinyang, so they didn’t think it was impossible for his sister to marry Tang Yunfan.

Looking at Yang Mingzhi, everyone believed that he asked for humiliation himself. How could he mess with such an important figure?

“Mr. Tang, I…” At this moment, Yang Mingzhi lost all of his confidence and pride. Whether he believed that Gu Qinyang was a relative of Tang Yunfan or not, it was obvious that they had a relationship. As a result, he didn’t dare to slight them.

Yang Mingzhi didn’t doubt Tang Yunfan’s words, because this hotel was owned by the Tanghuang Organization. If anyone dared to pretend to be the chairman, the staff would easily find out.

“What can you say now?” Tang Yunfan asked with a vague smile.

“Mr. Tang, I’m sorry, I failed to recognize you. I didn’t mean to annoy you. Please forgive me this time.” Yang Mingzhi begged for Tang Yunfan’s mercy and didn’t seem arrogant at all. He couldn’t care less about his face now.

If Tang Yunfan was mad at him, he could be easily removed from his position. Most importantly, he wasn’t a good public servant, so he felt guilty.

“Forgive you this time? I think we’re at the same age and you should be mature enough, right? How could you be so dumb?” Tang Yunfan made fun of Yang Mingzhi.

Yang Mingzhi understood that Tang Yunfan did it on purpose, but he dared not say anything.

“Mr. Tang, I’m really sorry. Please forgive me. I promise it won’t happen again.” Yang Mingzhi continued to beg for Tang Yunfan’s mercy. He was truly scared this time.

“Didn’t you want my brother-in-law to treat you? He doesn’t have time, and you threatened him,” added Tang Yunfan. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“No, no, I should buy you a meal instead,” said Yang Mingzhi. He hoped that they could accept his invitation and let him go today.

“We don’t need that. It’s just a meal. We can pay for it by ourselves,” said Tang Yunfan deliberately.

Given Tang Yunfan’s wealth, he could afford as many expensive meals as he wanted.

Yang Mingzhi was embarrassed. Even though he knew that Tang Yunfan was making fun of him, he didn’t dare to argue. In fact, he had no idea what to say at this moment.

Although Yang Mingzhi was shameless, he didn’t do anything to hurt them, so Tang Yunfan had no intention of punishing him. He only wanted to humiliate him for a while and didn’t think it was a big deal. Unfortunately, Yang Mingzhi was too dumb to figure out who he should apologize to.

“Mr. Yang, are you really dumb or are you acting dumb? Shouldn’t you apologize to my brother-in-law instead?” Tang Yunfan said.

He didn’t want to waste more time on Yang Mingzhi, but Yang Mingzhi must apologize to Gu Qinyang.

Hearing that, Yang Mingzhi finally realized what he had done wrong. Although he always disdained Gu Qinyang, he didn’t dare to slight him right now.

Given Tang Yunfan’s influence, Gu Qinyang would become rich sooner or later. Therefore, he had to please Gu Qinyang from now on.

“Gu Qinyang, I’m sorry, please forgive me. It’s all my fault. I promise it won’t happen again.” Yang Mingzhi had a good attitude. Actually, he was pretty good at fawning on other people.

“Alright, I think it should be over now,” said Gu Qinyang. He understood that Tang Yunfan asked Yang Mingzhi to apologize to him. He didn’t want to waste more time on Yang Mingzhi either, so he let Yang Mingzhi go.

“Thank you so much!” Yang Mingzhi felt relieved when Gu Qinyang was willing to let him go.

Without delay, he quickly left with his two friends.
