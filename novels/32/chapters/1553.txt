Chapter 1554: Must Go There

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Well, the thing is that Xiaoyu successfully got into the national team and he is going to the capital tomorrow afternoon to start his training. He always wanted to invite you to have a meal together to thank you face to face, but he hasn’t had the chance. He just read your post on Weibo and found out that you’re in City B now, so he asked me whether you’re willing to hang out with him for a while,” said Tang Jiakai.

He didn’t want to make it difficult for Gu Ning, so he left it totally up to her.

Gu Ning remained silent for a while and didn’t give him an answer right away, so Tang Jiakai explained at once. “Ningning, it’s fine if you don’t want to go. I can make an excuse and tell him that you’re not free.”

“It’s fine. I think we can spend some time in a nearby tea house,” Gu Ning said.

Although Gu Ning didn’t think it was necessary for Teng Xiaoyu to thank her face to face, he was Tang Jiakai’s friend after all. Since Tang Jiakai invited her to hang out together, she wouldn’t reject.

Actually, if Tang Jiakai thought that it wasn’t important, he would directly turn it down.

Gu Ning didn’t want to go too far or stay outside for too long, because it wasn’t easy for her to come back home and she had to leave tomorrow. She wanted to spend more time with her family.

“Ningning, are you sure you’re willing to hang out with them?” Tang Jiakai asked again.

“Of course,” Gu Ning said with a smile.

“Great, I’ll call Xiaoyu right now, and tell them to come over. I know there is a good tea house nearby, and grandpa often goes there with his old friends. We can go there tonight!” Tang Jiakai said.

“No problem.” Gu Ning agreed.

It wasn’t 8 pm yet, so they had an hour to hang out together. Teng Xiaoyu only wanted to see her and chat with her for a while, so an hour was enough.

As long as Gu Ning agreed to see him, Teng Xiaoyu was more than happy and didn’t care where they would meet and how long they could stay with each other.

After that, Gu Ning told her family that she needed to go out for a while.

Her family reminded her to be careful and to not come back too late.

Gu Ning and Tang Jiakai didn’t leave the Tang family’s house until Teng Xiaoyu and his friends had almost reached the appointed place, because it would only take them several minutes to reach the tea house, while Teng Xiaoyu was farther away.

Teng Xiaoyu also sped on the road to prevent Gu Ning from waiting for him for too long, so he arrived in 20 minutes.

However, Gu Ning actually didn’t mind waiting for a while longer, because people’s safety was most important.

Teng Xiaoyu arrived earlier, and his teammates would arrive later. They also wanted to see Gu Ning, because they regarded her as their idol.

Gu Ning and Tang Jiakai went to the tea house 10 minutes before Teng Xiaoyu. Therefore, once Teng Xiaoyu saw them, he greeted Gu Ning with enthusiasm and repeatedly thanked her for her help.

Actually, Teng Xiaoyu felt nervous when he talked to Gu Ning. Although Gu Ning was several years younger than him, she was already a very successful businesswoman, so he couldn’t help but stand in awe of her.

Luckily, as time went by, they got along very well, and he felt like Gu Ning was just like a younger sister next door. Gu Ning never thought that she was better than her friends, so she treated them nicely.

About a dozen minutes later, Tang Xiaoyu’s friends came and they also felt nervous when they faced Gu Ning at the beginning.

When it was about 10 pm, Gu Ning needed to go back home, so they left the tea house together.

Everyone was still up in the Tang family’s house at this time, because it wasn’t very late. Normally, they went to bed at 11 pm, so Gu Ning chatted with them for a while, before they all went back to their own rooms.

Leng Shaoting sent Gu Ning a message and asked her what she was doing now, so she told him that she was with her family, and would call him later.

Once she was back in her room, she called Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting told her that he was going to be back in the capital tomorrow night, while Gu Ning would fly back to the capital in the morning, the day after tomorrow, so they planned to go to City Qing in Province Qing, after they met in the capital.

Kunlun Mountain was very large, so they would mainly visit the Supreme Deity’s abode and Death Valley.

Death Valley had another name of “the Door to Hell”, and it was a forbidden place with many scary scenes.

Unfortunately, Leng Shaoting’s parents encountered an accident at Death Valley. So even if it was a forbidden place, they had to go there in order to figure out the real cause of Leng Shaoting’s mother’s death.

Even if they couldn’t find anything useful, they wouldn’t give up investigating.

Anyway, they could go there and visit the grave of Leng Shaoting’s father. Leng Shaoting’s father’s body was brought back, but his soul stayed where he died.

Gu Ning looked at the plane schedule, and decided to fly to the capital at 9:30 in the morning. They would probably need to wait in the capital for several hours for the next plane to Province Qing.

Although Leng Shaoting could use a private jet, Gu Ning didn’t think that it was necessary.
