Chapter 2229: New Drama Produced by Fenghua Entertainment

Because Yuan Shuyan was Yuan Yiyang’s cousin and they lived under the same roof, Yuan Shuyan was surrounded by her classmates and asked about the shocking news.

Yuan Shuyan knew this cousin of hers wasn’t a good guy, but she was also surprised by the crimes he had committed. However, the evidence was everywhere on the Internet now, and she couldn’t avoid it.

Whether Yuan Yiyang really had done those terrible things, Yuan Shuyan refused to admit it was true. She kept on saying that it was just a set up, because it could seriously damage the Yuan family’s reputation. However, all the evidence was public, so nobody believed Yuan Shuyan’s words.

They chose to ask Yuan Shuyan about it after the evidence was public simply because they wanted to hear the answer from her mouth, but obviously they failed.

Not many people asked Yuan Yilin about it, because Yuan Yilin was the Yuan family’s direct descendant, while Yuan Yiyang was her collateral relative. They didn’t live together, so Yuan Yilin might not be aware of what Yuan Yiyang had done. Besides, nobody dared to ask her.

It soon caused a great sensation, and the Ji family read the news too. Ji Wenna’s father called Yuan Yiyang’s father again and asked whether the news was true.

If it was true, they must end their marriage agreement between JI Wenna and Yuan Yiyang.

Although the Yuan family was a powerful family, they didn’t have to climb up the social ladder using a rotten, big family.

In addition, the Ji family didn’t have a much lower status than the Yuan family. Ji Wenna was pretty too, and she could marry another good family of power.

Yuan Yiyang’s father denied it strongly, not to comfort the Ji family, but for the Yuan family’s reputation. He couldn’t admit it! He still insisted on saying that it was a set up done by Yuan Yiyang’s enemies.

Yuan Yiyang’s family was now busy collecting evidence to prove that it was just a set up.

Ji Wenna’s father wasn’t dumb. He had believed Yuan Yiyang’s father once before when it wasn’t a serious problem, but now he wasn’t fully convinced after it became a great sensation.

Although he didn’t know much about Yuan Yiyang because he had spent many years in the military and he hadn’t heard much about Yuan Yiyang’s reputation either, he was clearly aware of the bad deeds of those heirs of wealth and power. However, before the final result came out, he couldn’t end the marriage alliance between their two families. He didn’t want to take the risk of offending the Yuan family and suffering a loss. Therefore, he decided to wait till the final result was out.

If Yuan Yiyang really had committed those crimes, but the Yuan family helped him get away with them and Yuan Yiyang was safe, he might accept it. There were few men who didn’t love playing around.

Ji Wenna’s father had that opinion not because he approved of that behavior or he did the same thing. He was a soldier after all, and it wasn’t allowed in the military. If he broke the law, his career in the government would come to an end.

He had that opinion simply because he knew the reality of this society.

…

Gu Ning didn’t bother to pay much attention to what would happen afterwards. She only needed to know how it unfolded.

In the canteen in the afternoon.

“I’m so surprised that Yuan Yiyang has committed so many terrible crimes! Now I have sympathy for Ji Wenna. I wonder whether she’ll end her marriage agreement with Yuan Yiyang after knowing what he has done,” said Song Miaoge. She was really shocked this time and suddenly sympathized with Ji Wenna.

She didn’t really sympathize with Ji Wenna and would soon go back to normal and hate Ji Wenna as usual. They were bitter enemies after all. She had sympathy for Ji Wenna only because she was a kind girl.

“I bet she’ll end the marriage agreement. No woman is willing to marry such a horrible man! It’s disgusting,” said Zhang Zikai with hatred for Yuan Yiyang.

“Hard to say. The Ji family aches to form a close relationship with the Yuan family. I think the Ji family will accept it if the Yuan family can help Yuan Yiyang get away with those crimes. They won’t end the marriage agreement.” Song Miaoge snorted.

Although her family wasn’t close to the Ji family, they were very familiar with each other. Song Miaoge clearly knew how snobbish the Ji family was. They would trade marriage for power.

In fact, Ji Wenna’s engagement with Yuan Yiyang was just a deal of power. Ji Wenna agreed only because she wanted to have a higher status and she actually liked Yuan Yiyang’s beautiful appearance.

“Fine!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Hearing that, Zhang Zikai didn’t know what to say. As a member in high society, she knew it wasn’t uncommon. There indeed were people who were willing to sell themselves or their dignity for money or power.

“Anyway, the Yuan family is a super powerful family. Even though the scandal caused a great sensation now, I’m afraid that people will soon forget it. He won’t be punished as he should be.” Song Miaoge sighed, and said in disappointment. She didn’t think Yuan Yiyang would be punished, because the Yuan family wasn’t an ordinary family. It was super powerful in this country and it wasn’t difficult for Yuan Yiyang to get away with the crimes.

As long as those victims’ families were willing to settle it out of court, Yuan Yiyang would be fine after paying the compensation.

Gu Ning had thought about that too, so she didn’t plan to let Yuan Yiyang stay in jail for too long. It was enough if he was sentenced to a few months or half a year in prison.

If the police did nothing, she would tell K to spread the news to a broader range. In order to alleviate the situation, Yuan Yiyang had to be sentenced to a few months in jail. After all, he really had broken the law.

…

A few days ago, Chu Peihan went to do an audition for a new drama produced by Fenghua Entertainment. She had the result today, so she shared the news with her friend in the WeChat group.

Chu Peihan had a very close relationship with Gu Ning, but she won the role relying on her acting skills, so she was very excited about it.

Although it wasn’t a major role, she could show her face before the cameras. She would play the role of the leading actress’s companion, so she was an important role in the new drama.

The next day, the list of the main actors of the new drama produced by Fenghua Entertainment was released and it quickly became big news.

It was a fantasy drama called?Life After Life, Legend of Demon Flower. It was adapted from a popular web novel.

Although Fenghua Entertainment had its own scriptwriters, there were many good novels on the Internet as well, so they wouldn’t miss any chances to make money.

Life After Life, Legend of Demon Flower?told a story of the female main character who was a Demon Flower in her first incarnation, but she fell in love with a cultivator, Bai Wuchen. Unfortunately, Bai Wuchen didn’t like her. What was worse, they were bitter enemies and he wanted to kill the Demon Flower. Because the Demon Flower loved Bai Wuchen, she killed herself in order to not put him in a dilemma.
