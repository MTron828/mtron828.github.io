762 He Will Be Fine

“Jiayang is in danger now, and I have to go help him,” Gu Ning said.

“What happened to him? Is it serious?” Gu Man’s heart was in her throat now. The Tang family had been through so many crises recently, and the important members were attacked one after another.

“Don’t worry. He’ll be fine.” Gu Ning comforted Gu Man.

Hearing that, Gu Man relaxed a little.

Afterwards, Gu Ning called K at once, and told him to find out who the gunman was by hacking into the surveillance cameras around the Tanghuang Group’s building. Although she knew that Tang Weiyong was the mastermind, she was determined to pay the gunman back. As long as she found the gunman, she would kill him.

Quan Mingkai called Tang Yunhang next and told him the bad news, but he didn’t call Tang Yunfan, in case Tang Yunfan ran out and exposed himself.

Tang Yunhang left for the hospital at once, and called Jiang Lihua on his way.

Jiang Lihua went to the hospital in the early morning and stayed in Tang Haifeng’s ward all the time. Even though Tang Haifeng was fine now, she had to visit him every day in order to not arouse others’ suspicion. When she heard the terrible news, she almost passed out.

“What’s wrong?” Tang Haifeng asked her in a hurry.

“J-Jiayang was shot.” Jiang Lihua burst into tears.

“What?” Tang Haifeng was shocked.

They were mentally prepared for more attacks, but they still couldn’t accept that Tang Jiayang was the next target.

“Jiayang took Ningning’s medicine, and he is out of danger now. Don’t panic. Ningning is on her way to the hospital, and Jiayang will be fine with Ningning’s help.” Tang Yunhang comforted Jiang Lihua.

“Will Jiayang still be fine after being shot?” Jiang Lihua was anxious. Tang Jiayang was her son, and her heart ached for him.

“Alright, stay there with father, and don’t let him leave the ward,” Tang Yunhang said.

“Fine.” No matter how worried Jiang Lihua was, she chose to believe Gu Ning.

Right after Jiang Lihua hung up the call with Tang Yunhang, Tang Haifeng removed the quilt and was about to stand up. Jiang Lihua stopped him at once. “Father, what are you doing?”

“I’m going to see Jiayang.” Tang Haifeng couldn’t wait a second longer to check whether Tang Jiayang was fine now.

“Father, Yunhang said that you can’t leave this ward. Jiayang took Ningning’s medicine, and he’s safe now. He’ll arrive here to take out the bullet soon. I’ll tell you the latest news if I hear any, alright?” Jiang Lihua said.

Knowing that Tang Jiayang was safe now, Tang Haifeng calmed down a little. He trusted Gu Ning very much.

“Tang Wen, Tang Wu, stay here and take care of Master Tang. I’ll go out for a while,” Jiang Lihua said to Tang Wen and Tang Wu.

“Sure,” Tang Wen and Tang Wu said.

Although they were Tang Haifeng’s bodyguards, and only listened to his orders, they knew what was the right thing to do now. They understood that Tang Haifeng was worried about Tang Jiayang, but he couldn’t show up at this moment.

Luckily, Tang Haifeng listened to Jiang Lihua and lay down on the bed.

Once Jiang Lihua walked out, she ran to the front door of the hospital.

At the same time, Tang Jiayang’s car arrived.

The moment the car door opened, a group of nurses and doctors walked forward to help Tang Jiayang get out of the car.

Jiang Lihua ran ahead at once, and burst into tears again. “Jiayang, Jiayang!”

“Mom, I’m fine.” Tang Jiayang comforted his mother.

Tang Jiayang wasn’t in a terrible condition now, but Jiang Lihua was still concerned about his safety.

“Mrs. Tang, we need to take the bullet out of Lord Tang’s body right now. Please stand aside,” a doctor said to Jiang Lihua politely.

“Sure.” Jiang Lihua walked aside at once.

They pushed Tang Jiayang into the operating room without delay, followed by Jiang Lihua, but she could only wait outside.

A few minutes later, Gu Ning arrived.

“How’s Jiayang now?” Gu Man asked Jiang Lihua with concern.

“No idea,” Jiang Lihua said anxiously.

“Don’t worry. Jiayang will be fine.” Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see inside the operating room. Tang Jiayang was safe; he just lost some blood.

She would put her magical power into his body later, and he would be fine.

After a while, Quan Mingkai and Tang Yunhang arrived too.

It took around 20 minutes for the doctor to take the bullet out of Tang Jiayang’s body.

After the surgery, Tang Jiayang was pushed out. He was still under anesthetic, but the surgery was very successful. The bullet didn’t hit his heart after all, and Gu Ning’s power crystal stopped him from bleeding and helped him heal.

Tang Jiayang was sent to a ward later.

When the doctor was gone, and there were only members of the Tang family in the ward, Gu Ning walked to Tang Jiayang and began to unwrap the bandages around his wound.

“Ningning, what are you doing?” Jiang Lihua was a little scared. Although she believed that Gu Ning wouldn’t hurt Tang Jiayang, she was afraid that it might be painful.

“I’m going to treat his wound,” Gu Ning said, and kept on unwrapping the bandages.

When Gu Ning was unwrapping the bandages, she said to Qiao Ya, “Qiao Ya, go pour me a glass of water.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“No problem.” Qiao Ya went to pour a glass of water at once, and placed it on the table next to Gu Ning.

Gu Ning then took out a porcelain bottle and poured some water in it before she started to apply the water mixed with the power crystal to Tang Jiayang’s wound. After that, she removed the stitches with her hands.

Seeing that, Jiang Lihua wanted to stop Gu Ning again, but thought that she should believe Gu Ning.

Within a short time, Gu Ning finished removing the stitches, and Jiang Lihua prayed that Tang Jiayang would be fine.
