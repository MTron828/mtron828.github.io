Chapter 607 Do You Have Any Good News to Tell Us?

These past two days, Tang Yunfan stayed alone with Gu Man except at dinner time, but they just chatted with each other or watched TV together in the living room. Although they didn’t feel uneasy getting along with each other now, they were still very polite to each other.

Tang Yunfan seemed calm, but he was actually very anxious. Although he knew haste made waste, he was eager to be close to Gu Man.

In fact, Gu Man already accepted Tang Yunfan and was accustomed to getting along with members of the Tang family, but she thought that they better take it slowly.

At that moment, only Tang Yunfan and Gu Man were watching TV in the living hall.

Tang Yunhang and his wife had already left to attend the party in the Lei family’s house, and Tang Haifeng stayed in his study so that Tang Yunfan and Gu Man could have some private time.

When Gu Ning arrived at the Tang family’s house, Feng Xueqin and Liu Xinqi also arrived at the Lei family’s house. However, she didn’t see Tang Yunfan.

Once they walked in, Feng Xueqin glanced around searching for Tang Yunfan.

People around her were all from high society, so they all knew Feng Xueqin but they looked at her with obvious disdain.

If she remained single because she devoted herself to her career or she was a disabled person, others would only respect her. However, she did it because of a man that she could never get. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

When Tong Wen and the others saw Feng Xueqin they were also displeased, especially when they noticed others’ attitude towards her. Nevertheless, it was a public place, so they couldn’t argue with her in front of others. Even Tong Wen who disliked Feng Xueqin the most remained silent. She could argue with Feng Xueqin as loudly as she wanted to but she couldn’t do it in public.

Luckily, they knew that Tang Yunfan was absent today, so Feng Xueqin wouldn’t embarrass their family too much. However, just because they remained silent didn’t mean that others would do the same thing.

“Oh, isn’t this Miss Feng? Miss Feng is taking part in today’s party along with Chairman Liu. Do you have any good news to tell us?” a noble woman walked over and said to Feng Xueqin, but she sounded quite unkind. She, of course, knew that Feng Xueqin came here today for Tang Yunfan, so she purposely said that to annoy Feng Xueqin.

Feng Xueqin was mad at once, but she didn’t argue with her but forced herself to calm down. “Mrs. Kong, Chairman Liu and I are just friends. What’s wrong with that?”

“Oh, I understand. Then I bet you must have come here for Lord Tang, right?” another noble woman said in an acid tone. “Unfortunately, Lord Tang went abroad, and he’s absent today.”

People were used to addressing Tang Yunfan as Lord Tang although he was actually the chairman of the Tanghuang Group now. However, they had to address Tang Yunhang as Secretary Tang, because he was the most powerful figure in City B.

Tang Yunhang told Lei Haowei that Tang Yunfan had gone abroad, and most people at the party had heard it.

“What?” Feng Xueqin was obviously disappointed. Hearing that Tang Yunfan was absent, Feng Xueqin turned around walking away but was stopped by Liu Xinqi. He approached her ear and said in a low voice, “If you leave like that, I’ll feel embarrassed, and don’t forget to fulfill the condition. You must come with me and leave with me!”

Hearing that, Feng Xueqin had to stay although she was unwilling to do so.

It was a long party for her.

Gu Ning sat in the Tang family’s house for a while, then went back to Huafu Hills with Gu Man.

Before long, Gu Ning discovered that some people were stalking her.

She checked it for a while, and noticed that they were strangers. She didn’t know who sent them, but she wasn’t willing to have conflict with them now because Gu Man was in her car, so she had to get rid of them.

“Mom, some people are stalking us. I must speed up to get rid of them. Be prepared,” Gu Ning said to Gu Man.

“W-what? Some people are stalking us?” Gu Man’s face turned pale at once, because she thought of the abduction.

Feeling Gu Man’s anxiety, Gu Ning comforted her. “Don’t worry. Mom, we’ll be fine.”

Although Gu Man trusted Gu Ning, she was still worried.

Gu Ning directly accelerated, then overtook one car after another on the road even though there was a lot of traffic, so Gu Man couldn’t relax for fear of an accident, and Gu Ning’s action also caused a lot of grievances.

However, when a group of young men noticed it, they were all impressed.

“Gee, it’s the limited edition Lamborghini!”

“Wow, it looks so cool, and its driver is so good!”

In a car behind Gu Ning, two men were struck dumb.

“Seriously? She’s so good at driving?” A man couldn’t believe his eyes.

“I think she found us,” another man said.

After a short while, Gu Ning got rid of them. When she slowed down, Gu Man finally relaxed a little. “Ningning, did we get rid of them?”

“Yes,” Gu Ning said.

“Who are they? Could they be the same people who abducted me last time?” Gu Man was anxious.

“Mom, relax. You’re safe with me,” Gu Ning said to comfort her.

After a while of silence, Gu Man said, “Ningning, your aunt called me today, and the salon is ready to open after a few days. When will we go back to City F?” Gu Man wasn’t in a hurry to go back, but their beauty salon was going to open again.

Hearing that, Gu Ning suddenly thought of her skincare products.

“Mom, let’s try new skincare products. I know a brand which is quite effective,” Gu Ning said.

“Will the customers be willing to use new products?” Gu Man asked.

“If they’re worried, we can sign an agreement with them. If there is any side effect, we’ll pay ten times compensation. I think they’ll know how good our new products are once they try them,” Gu Ning said with confidence.

“Great. Let me call your aunt now.” Since Gu Ning said so, Gu Man agreed.

Gu Man then called Gu Qing and told her what Gu Ning had said.

Gu Qing of course chose to believe and listen to Gu Ning.
