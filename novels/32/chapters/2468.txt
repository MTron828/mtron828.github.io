Chapter 2469 New Year Festival

However, he was reluctant to give Pan Zirui a million yuan, even though he was the real mastermind

“What if I don’t pay compensation?” Liu Chenyuan asked.

Li Boyu lost his patience. “If you refuse, he’ll call the police. If he calls the police, I’ll be the first one who’s punished, because all the evidence proves that I’m guilty. You wanted me to help you, so I did it for you. However, now that the secret has been exposed, I don’t want to shoulder the blame for you!”

If Liu Chenyuan was unwilling to give Pan Zirui the money and Pan Zirui called the police afterwards, he would betray Liu Chenyuan. After all, it was Liu Chenyuan who refused to take responsibility; it wasn’t his fault. Hearing that, Liu Chenyuan understood that he had to give in. If he didn’t give Pan Zirui the money, Li Boyu would be arrested by the police.

And if Li Boyu was caught, he would be exposed too. Anyway, he was left with no choice now, or his reputation would be greatly damaged. Besides, his relationship with Li Boyu would also be completely ruined.

Although he didn’t want to pay the money, a million yuan wasn’t much for him.

“Alright, tell Pan Zirui to give me his bank details. I’ll transfer the money to him tomorrow,” said Liu Chenyuan. He was unwilling to face Pan Zirui in person.

“Sure,” said Li Boyu, then hung up.

Pan Zirui didn’t hear Li Boyu’s conversation with Liu Chenyuan on the phone, but Gu Ning did. Since Liu Chenyuan already yielded, there was no need for them to pay more attention to

it.

After that, Li Boyu said to Pan Zirui, “Liu Chenyuan agreed to pay you the money. Give me your bank details. He’ll transfer the money to you tomorrow.”

“Great.” As long as Liu Chenyuan gave him the money, Pan Zirui didn’t care what method he used. He wasn’t afraid that they lied to him, because he wouldn’t let them go if they dared to do that.

Pan Zirui then told Li Boyu his bank details.

Afterwards, Gu Ning and Pan Zirui left. From the beginning to the end, Gu Ning said nothing

Pan Zirui was surprised that the problem was solved smoothly, but Li Boyu quickly admitted his crime. If he insisted on denying it, it would have been difficult for them to solve the problem.

Moreover, with Gu Ning’s support, he dared to be tough and let Li Boyu know that he wasn’t scared of him. If he was scared of Li Boyu, he wouldn’t have been able to solve the problem either.

“Boss, thank you so much. If it hadn’t been for you, I honestly would have had no idea how to deal with it!” Pan Zirui thanked Gu Ning once more. That was all he could do right now.

“Alright, you’ve thanked me countless times. You don’t need to do it again. If you still don’t get the money tomorrow night, let me know,” said Gu Ning. Since she agreed to help him, she didn’t need him to repeatedly thank her.

“Sure,” said Pan Zirui. He wanted to thank her again, but Gu Ning said it was enough, so he stopped. Pan Zirui understood that Gu Ning thought they were close enough not to say thanks now. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

On the way back, Pan Zirui took a taxi. Gu Ning and the others didn’t drive him back, because he was a grown man, so they directly returned to Huafu Hills.

The next day, Pan Zirui received the money in the afternoon before letting Gu Ning know. And that was the end of it.

If Liu Chenyuan dared to cause him trouble again, he wouldn’t let him go so easily the next time.

However, Liu Chenyuan wasn’t dumb, and he immediately told Li Boyu to figure out who was supporting Pan Zirui. When he heard that the person was Gu Ning, he was shocked and full of regret. If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have been so stupid. Now he lost 1.2 million yuan.

Due to Gu Ning’s fame, he was aware that she was the chairman of the Shengning Organization, was Tang Yunfan’s daughter, and also had connections in high places. Most importantly, the group of gangsters told them that Gu Ning was their head’s friend. Their head had ordered them not to mess with her.

Therefore, after knowing that it was Gu Ning who was behind Pan Zirui, they didn’t dare to cause him trouble again.

Originally, Liu Chenyuan thought that Gu Ning only had contact with the Heiqi Organization which was owned by the Kirin Gang, but unexpectedly, she had a close relationship with the head of the Kirin Gang.

That mattered a lot more than just having contact with the Heiqi Organization.

In addition, the head of the Kirin Gang had specially given an order that they shouldn’t mess with Gu Ning, which meant she was very influential in the Kirin Gang.

And even if she didn’t have a close relationship with the Kirin Gang, she was the chairman of the Shengning Organization, so Liu Chenyuan didn’t dare to offend her.

Therefore, he had to admit that he had bad luck this time and would have to be careful in the future.

At the same time, he was jealous of Pan Zirui for having a good relationship with Gu Ning.

A few days later, it was the New Year festival. During the festival, everyone would receive countless messages and calls of good wishes from their family members and friends.

Gu Ning didn’t have time to call each of her friends, so she sent them messages.

Because the Tang family had many members, they celebrated the New Year festival of activity.

Although Gu Ning was still a student, she gave each member of the Tang family, including the domestic servants, a thick red envelope.

They didn’t really care about how much money was in the red envelope since it was just a sign of love, but Gu Ning was very generous so she even gave each of the servants ten thousand yuan.

There were a few dozen servants in the Tang family, so she gave them hundreds of thousands of yuan in total.

The normal servants would get ten thousand yuan, while those senior servants would get twenty thousand yuan.

The Tang family also gave them a red envelope every year. Each of them would get about forty thousand yuan. After all, they did their jobs to the best of their ability, so it was very normal.

Their salaries weren’t low. The normal servants could have a monthly pay of about ten thousand yuan, while senior servants had a pay of twenty thousand yuan.

Gu Ning also gave every member of the Tang family a red envelope, while the senior members of the Tang family gave her a red envelope in return.

Because Gu Ning already had her own career, she could afford to give her family red envelopes. However, in the eyes of the senior members of the Tang family, Gu Ning was junior to them. She was still a kid, so they were willing to give her red envelopes.
