Chapter 1824: This girl is too cruel!

There was nothing wrong with Shen Zhilin liking Leng Shaoting and wanting to marry him, but the problem was that she took it for granted.

Just because Leng Shaoting disliked her and rejected her, she vented her anger on the girl that Leng Shaoting liked, and blamed the girl for everything.

Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue also saw Shen Zhilin and Chen Qiuyin. From their looks, they knew the two women had a grudge with Gu Ning.

However, it was Gu Ning’s business, so they wouldn’t say anything if Gu Ning remained silent.

Gu Ning didn’t even care about them, so she ignored them and looked at the clothes in the store.

Chen Qiuyin and Shen Zhilin’s eyes followed Gu Ning. They wished to eat her and tear her apart.

The shopping guide who served them looked embarrassed, and didn’t know how to stop them. She only hoped that there would be no conflict in the store.

Gu Ning and her two friends walked around, but didn’t see anything they liked, so they left.

“Stop there!”

Just when Gu Ning and her two friends reached the door of the store, Chen Qiuyin stopped them with a shout from behind.

Gu Ning knew she was calling her, but she continued to move forward as if she didn’t hear it.

Although Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue paused for a while, seeing that Gu Ning didn’t mean to stop, they naturally followed her and walked outside.

When Chen Qiuyin saw that Gu Ning ignored her, she was so angry that she ran towards them and stood in Gu Ning’s way, forcing her to stop.

Shen Zhilin followed Chen Qiuyin behind.

“I told you to stop. Didn’t you hear?” Chen Qiuyin scolded, with a superior attitude.

Chen Qiuyin didn’t know Gu Ning’s identity, so she didn’t have any fear of her. She ran away in a hurry last time simply because she had lost her face.

“I heard, but why do I have to listen to you?” Gu Ning looked at her coldly and asked without a kind face and a kind tone.

“Why? Because you are the other woman in my daughter’s relationship,” Chen Qiuyin said.

Hearing this, Gu Ning slightly squinted, revealing coldness.

The other woman in her daughter’s relationship? This girl is shameless!

All the surrounding people all looked at Gu Ning with disgust all of a sudden.

Everyone hated those who ruined other people’s romantic relationships.

“Jesus, I can’t believe it! This girl is so young. She is so good-looking. Why does she want to be the other woman in other people’s romantic relationship?”

“It happens. All the mistresses now are young and beautiful.”

“Makes sense.”

“...”

Baili Zongxue and Song Miaoge were angry. They didn’t believe that Gu Ning was such a person, but they didn’t know anything about it, so they had no idea how to defend Gu Ning. They were unwilling to cause her more trouble at this time.

“Really? Tell me, I got involved in your daughter’s relationship with whom?” Gu Ning asked with a sneer.

Although Gu Ning was very angry, she didn’t lose her temper yet.

“Stop playing dumb. Zhilin and Shaoting grew up together, and our two families are relatives. We were talking about their marriage. It was you who suddenly appeared and seduced Shaoting, so Shaoting refused to marry Zhilin,” Chen Qiuyin said with a furious expression as if she was telling the truth.

When Shen Zhilin heard that, she looked sad. Because she was indeed sad, so her expression was sincere.

Once they said that, onlookers became even angrier, and began to criticize Gu Ning.

“It’s really sad for her parents to have such a daughter! She doesn’t learn anything good from other people, but becomes a mistress.”

“Right, like mother, like daughter. Perhaps her mother is also...”

Gu Ning didn’t feel much anger when others criticized her, but when it came to her parents, Gu Ning couldn’t bear it. She turned extremely displeased, and shot her piercing eyes at the woman who badmouthed her mother. She scolded,”Shut your mouth!”

In the woman’s eyes, Gu Ning’s look was like a sharp arrow directly hitting her heart, which frightened her. She also felt stressed, gasping for breath.

Not only the woman, but also the people around, were frightened by Gu Ning’s anger, including Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue.

After that, Gu Ning stopped paying attention to the woman, but looked at Chen Qiuyin, which made Chen Qiuyin tremble all over. She had to admit that she was frightened by Gu Ning’s anger too.

After thinking further about it, she believed that Gu Ning was nothing more than a little girl, so she shouldn’t be afraid of her.

However, as soon as she had that thought, she felt her throat tightened. Gu Ning’s face became larger before her eyes, and she realized that her throat was already pressed by her.

Everyone was shocked when they watched this scene. While being amazed by Gu Ning’s speed, they also felt that this young girl was too vicious.

Onlookers thought that Gu Ning was cruel simply because they didn’t know the truth. If they learned the truth but still believed she was the vicious one here, they must be either stupid or sanctimonious.

“You...” Chen Qiuyin uttered a word with difficulty, and immediately raised her hand trying to beat Gu Ning, but Gu Ning coldly warned her. “Don’t you dare!”

As Gu Ning said that, she used greater strength at her hand, making Chen Qiuyin even more uncomfortable and too scared to move.

“Mom...” Shen Zhilin came back to her senses after being stunned for a second. She was shocked, and immediately stepped forward, trying to save Chen Qiuyin.

“Get her,” Gu Ning said when she saw that.

Hearing that, before Song Miaoge could do anything, Baili Zongxue moved to pull away Shen Zhilin who had just grabbed Gu Ning’s hand.

She simply caught her shoulder lightly, but it was enough to make Shen Zhilin unable to break away.

“Let go of me, let me go!” Shen Zhilin shouted.

“This girl is too cruel!”

“I agree. She must be furious with embarrassment after her dirty secret is exposed.”

Because of Gu Ning’s strength, the two people didn’t dare to talk about her loudly. However, they disliked Gu Ning’s behavior, so they still muttered.

Gu Ning turned to give them a glare at once, and the two people trembled in fright, turning their heads away with a guilty conscience.

“If you don’t know anything, don’t talk nonsense. If you dare to say another word, you might not be able to bear the result.” Gu Ning warned.

The man was so scared that his neck shrank. He dared not say another word. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

When other people heard her words, they all guessed that what Chen Qiuyin just said might not be the truth.

After all, they just heard her account and they didn’t know whether it was true or not, so it was too early to make a conclusion. Therefore, no one dared to say anything for the time being.

Gu Ning returned her sight to Chen Qiuyin in front of her, and asked in a deep, cold, and dangerous voice, “Mrs. Shen, are you sure that I am the other woman who tried to destroy Miss Shen and Shaoting’s relationship?”
