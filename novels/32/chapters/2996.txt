2997 I Can’t Win

During that time, Ling Tianqi approached Xiong Manxin’s ears and quietly said, “Doesn’t Leng Xiaoyao have any interest in handsome guys? Why is she so calm?”

Hearing that, Xiong Manxin guessed. “Perhaps she can’t forget her ex, but I don’t think that’s the reason.”

Leng Xiaoyao’s ex was Chu Jianan.

Given Leng Xiaoyao’s attitude towards Chu Jianan, it seemed that she had already gotten over it, but now they wondered whether Leng Xiaoyao simply hid her emotions.

The others had the same thought, so they stopped talking about it.

Before long, Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen finished choosing their cars. They put on equipment, then drove the car to the starting line.

The third track was a twisting mountain road with turns and narrow parts. It was wide enough to allow two cars to drive through in a line, but it was difficult to overtake cars, because the car could easily block the way.

However, they were only competing for fun, so they wouldn’t cause trouble. Whether they could overtake each other all relied on their abilities.

The moment they heard a gunshot, Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen set out at the same time.

At the beginning, they drove abreast, but gradually Li Mochen overtook Leng Xiaoyao.

Seeing that, everyone was disappointed, because they had hoped that Leng Xiaoyao could win, but it was obvious that Li Mochen was very skilled.

Nevertheless, Leng Xiaoyao stayed calm.

After the cars were far away, the others could only watch the game on the monitor.

Both Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen were extremely skilled, so the competition was expected to go down the wire. Neither of them slowed down at turns. Luckily, no accidents happened and they drove steadily.

Although Li Mochen overtook Leng Xiaoyao, Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t left far behind. She was only a few meters behind. In that case, she could overtake Li Mochen anytime. Therefore, the audience was disappointed, but they still had hope.

Everyone watched it with excitement and worry.

After they finished two tenths of the track, Leng Xiaoyao overtook Li Mochen and everyone cheered, but Li Mochen wasn’t left far behind Leng Xiaoyao. He could overtake her at any time as well.

A while later, Li Mochen overtook Leng Xiaoyao. As they competed with each other, they were nearing the ending.

“Wow, they’re basically at the same level. Could it be a draw?” Si Yiqi exclaimed. He didn’t want it to be a draw, because he hoped that Leng Xiaoyao could win.

“I don’t think so!” Ling Tianqi felt it was impossible. After all, being even half a meter behind would be considered a loss.

Pei Heran and Feng Rui also believed it was impossible.

Xiong Manxin knew very little about car racing, so she couldn’t see who was more likely to win. She only felt that both of them were very skilled.

However, Si Yiqi guessed correctly. Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen arrived at the finish line at the same time. No one was quicker.

“Jesus, it’s indeed a draw. Did they do that on purpose?” Si Yiqi refused to believe it. Although neither he nor Li Mochen would lose anything, it was a race so he hoped to see a winner, especially if the winner was Leng Xiaoyao.

Ling Tianqi and the others felt it was unbelievable too, because they really arrived at the finish line at the same time.

However, both Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen were astonished by the other’s skill at car racing. Both of them had done their best, but neither won.

Anyway, it wasn’t a bad result for it to be a draw.

After they got out of the cars, Si Yiqi immediately walked towards them and asked, “Did you do that on purpose?”

“I wanted to win, but I failed. I couldn’t do anything about it.” Leng Xiaoyao shrugged. Although she didn’t have to defeat Li Mochen, she really did her best.

Li Mochen didn’t explain, but he also did his best. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Fine!” Si Yiqi was unwilling to accept the result, but it was reality. Anyway, a draw was enough to prove that they were both very skilled.

And they had broken the record for the shortest time on that track.

Even in an international competition, not many racers were a match for them.

“It’s late now. If you don’t mind, why don’t we dine together?” Si Yiqi suggested. It was a sincere invitation.

He only had a deep impression of Leng Xiaoyao, but he would treat her friends politely.

“Sure!” Leng Xiaoyao agreed right away. If Li Mochen wasn’t there, she might turn Si Yiqi down, but she wanted to go since Li Mochen was present. She could only get familiar with him after spending more time together.

Ling Tianqi and the others said nothing. Instead, they were more than willing to become familiar with Si Yiqi.

They had high status too, so they wouldn’t try to flatter Si Yiqi, they just wanted to form a good relationship with him.

Therefore, if Si Yiqi was reluctant to make friends with them, they wouldn’t bother him. After all, they had their pride.

After that, they went to a restaurant.

There were restaurants of different levels around the circuit. Since Si Yiqi would pay the bill, they went to a luxurious restaurant.

Along the way, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t pay special attention to Li Mochen, nor did she talk to him, because Li Mochen wasn’t talkative. He rarely talked to strangers.

Si Yiqi, on the other hand, was talking to Leng Xiaoyao the entire time. He asked her for basic information about her, like her age, whether she was a student, where she studied, and which grade she was in right now.

It wasn’t a secret, so Leng Xiaoyao told him everything.

While Si Yiqi spoke to Leng Xiaoyao, he didn’t ignore Ling Tianqi and the others, so he chatted with them once in a while too.

During the chat, Si Yiqi learned about their identities. After knowing that they were members as well, he felt that he could make friends with them too.

Business people needed connections the most. Therefore, Si Yiqi gave them his name card.

Ling Tianqi and the others exchanged name cards with him.

After they arrived at the restaurant, Leng Xiaoyao deliberately sat next to Li Mochen. Li Mochen didn’t care, because Leng Xiaoyao did it naturally. It didn’t seem deliberate at all.

After they sat down, a waiter came over with menus for each of them.

“Please order whatever you want to eat. No need to save money for me,” Si Yiqi said.
