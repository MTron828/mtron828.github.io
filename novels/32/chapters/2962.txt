2964 Call Me Mr. Han

However, even if he was going to lose, he wouldn’t quit halfway. And he was determined to do his best. He wouldn’t allow himself to have total failure.

Afterwards, Leng Xiaoyao shook the dice cup, and Ji Yanxi still guessed whether it was big or small. Ji Yanxi guessed correctly, but Leng Xiaoyao was still far better than him according to the odds.

In the last round, Leng Xiaoyao guessed the total score was 6, and it turned out really to be 6. The three dice even piled up and the number shown at the top was 6.

When it was the last turn, Ji Yanxi guessed it was 8, and he was right, but all in all, he lost.

!!

“I lost, and I accept the result. I’ll tell the counter to give you your money according to the chips,” Ji Yanxi said. He was really convinced, but said resignedly, “Miss Leng, can you save some effort next time? Please don’t win more than five hundred thousand yuan, and don’t come frequently, otherwise I won’t be able to run my business.”

“Mr. Ji, don’t worry. I won’t win more than five hundred thousand yuan the next time. And I won’t come here very often. No more than three times a month. What do you think?” said Leng Xiaoyao. She wouldn’t make it difficult for Ji Yanxi. After all, Ji Yanxi was the manager, not the boss. If she won too much money, it would cause trouble for Ji Yanxi.

Although they were strangers, Ji Yanxi had a high status, so it wasn’t a bad thing if they could form a good relationship.

Hearing Leng Xiaoyao’s words, Ji Yanxi was relieved.

“Uncle Han, can you send me home?” Leng Xiaoyao asked Han Yu.

Han Yu’s hidden illness wasn’t a big deal, so she could help him if he wanted. She actually didn’t care whether he would tell Leng Yecheng about what she did. Even if Leng Yecheng knew, it wasn’t a big deal.

She was willing to help him because he was close to Leng Yecheng and had helped him a lot.

Han Yu took a deep breath when Leng Xiaoyao called him uncle, but it wasn’t wrong, so he couldn’t say anything about it.

“Sure!” Han Yu agreed, but he hadn’t decided whether to trust Leng Xiaoyao yet. He only agreed to send Leng Xiaoyao back because of Leng Yecheng.

Afterwards, Han Yu walked Leng Xiaoyao out. Before they left, they exchanged her chips for money.

Those who wanted to see Leng Xiaoyao beaten were surprised when she walked out safely and even went to exchange her chips for money. All of a sudden, they realized that she wasn’t an ordinary girl.

No wonder she was so arrogant!

In the car, Leng Xiaoyao said, “Uncle Han…”

“Enough!”

When Han Yu heard her call him uncle again, he couldn’t stand it any longer and immediately interrupted. “You look like a woman in your twenties, while I’m only thirty years old. Isn’t it a little humiliating for you to call me uncle.”

“But I’m only eighteen, and you’re my uncle’s friend. You should be in the same generation. Can’t I call you uncle?” Leng Xiaoyao seemed innocent, but she actually said it on purpose.

Han Yu was struck dumb for a second. Although Leng Xiaoyao was right, he still couldn’t accept it. “Just call me Mr. Han.”

“Fine, Mr. Han.” Leng Xiaoyao didn’t continue to call him uncle. In fact, she also found it strange.

If it weren’t for Leng Yecheng, she ought to call him brother.

“Mr. Han, I know it’s hard for you to trust me. After all, we’re not familiar. And I was a good-for-nothing in many people’s eyes, but there is no need to rush. You can think about it. Your illness won’t affect you too much within a short time. You’ll only feel uncomfortable when you have a relapse. In the following two months, if you trust me, you can come to see me.” Leng Xiaoyao said, “Don’t worry, you’re my third uncle’s friend and you’ve helped him a lot. I won’t harm you.”

“Thanks!” Han Yu indeed needed time to make sure that Leng Xiaoyao had the ability, so what Leng Xiaoyao said satisfied his need.

Although he hadn’t talked about it with Leng Yecheng yet, he trusted him.

After Han Yu drove Leng Xiaoyao to the wall of the Leng family’s house, Leng Xiaoyao told him to stop, because she didn’t want to go home through the front door. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Han Yu didn’t ask and directly stopped the car.

Leng Xiaoyao said good-bye to Han Yu, then walked to the wall. After an easy jump, she got inside.

Han Yu watched everything, and was surprised.

It seemed so easy for Leng Xiaoyao to jump over the wall. Even he wasn’t that agile!

Leng Xiaoyao confused him because she was totally different!

In fact, Leng Xiaoyao deliberately jumped over the wall in front of Han Yu. She wanted him to know that she had skills, which might convince him to trust her.

After Leng Xiaoyao got into the yard by jumping over the wall, she climbed up the wall to the window, which was very easy for her.

She didn’t want to be caught, or she could have directly jumped from the ground using qinggong.

Leng Xiaoyao went out at 8 pm, and it was 11 pm when she was back home, so no one knew that she was gone.

Before she left home, she told them that she needed a good rest, so no one bothered her.

Back in her room, Leng Xiaoyao immediately removed her make-up and changed her clothes, then went to bed, but she couldn’t sleep right away, so she thought about what she needed to do next.

Currently, she had over a million yuan, which was enough to start a small business, but that wasn’t enough for her to do something big.

Therefore, she must make full use of the million yuan.

She thought about the jade industry, because that was where Gu Ning made a fortune, so she felt it might be a good idea, but she wasn’t good at stone-gambling.

She didn’t think she could make money in the real estate industry, because she only had a million yuan instead of a hundred million yuan.

It was impossible for her to build a block in a second-tier city without a hundred million yuan.

Without connections, she couldn’t run an entertainment company either.

For the time being, Leng Xiaoyao had no idea what to do, so she stopped thinking about it. Perhaps a good idea would come to mind!

That night Leng Xiaoyao slept well.

When she got up the next morning, Leng Xiaoyao went to cultivate for a while on the top floor.

She didn’t know why her cultivation was restricted, but she still needed to cultivate.
