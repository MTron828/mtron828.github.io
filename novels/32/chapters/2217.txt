Chapter 2220: Frame Him

Therefore, senior officials in the capital also heard the news and called Song Wenxuan to ask him about it.

As for the reason why Song Wenxuan was almost assassinated, none of them was dumb so they easily figured out the reason. People in the same faction as the Leng family asked whether he had found out who the gunman was, while other people in other factions didn’t bother to ask about that.

Because of the attempted assassination of Song Wenxuan, leaders of the officials who had the motive called them and asked them whether they had done that.

They didn’t forbid them to attack Song Wenxuan, and it was actually their leaders’ order at this moment, but they had to be careful and not expose their scheme.

If it was exposed and became serious, their leaders would choose to abandon them for the sake of their own safety.

After the Yuan family found out that it was done by their people, they told Zhou Litao to be cautious and not be dragged into the trouble. Even if he was found guilty, he could find himself a scapegoat.

…

After Gu Ning finished the meal with Qiao Ya, she received K’s reply, but he failed to get the goods on Zhou Litao.

He had only conducted an investigation through surveillance videos and their family members’ bank accounts. As long as they were very careful, there would be no useful information left. In that case, Gu Ning could only carry out her plan.

She needed to carefully think about it first, so Gu Ning disguised herself as Tang Aining after having the meal, then went to look around near Zhou Litao’s home.

Zhou Litao lived in a high-end residential area, but his salary couldn’t afford a house in it. However, his wife was a businesswoman and her family was rich, so it was reasonable that they had an expensive house. Therefore, even if Zhou Litao was a corrupt official, nobody could see that from his life on the surface.

Gu Ning sat on a chair in the forest path near Zhou Litao’s home, then used her Jade Eyes to see the situation inside to see if there were any secret rooms or the like with hidden things that shouldn’t be there.

If there were, Gu Ning wouldn’t need to put anything illegal in his home. It could cause her loss after all. If there weren’t, she would put something illegal in his house.

After looking around with her Jade Eyes, she found a secret room, but there was nothing illegal inside.

It seemed that Zhou Litao was really an upright official, or he must be very skilled at hiding his illicit income.

Gu Ning didn’t leap to conclusions that Zhou Litao must be a corrupt official just because he was serving the Yuan family and had tried to kill Song Wenxuan. However, even if she didn’t see any evidence to prove he was a corrupt official, it didn’t mean he wasn’t corrupt.

Some officials didn’t accept much bribery, and knew how to hide it, so it would be difficult to discover it.

Gu Ning didn’t have much time to conduct a thorough investigation now, so she decided to frame Zhou Litao. She aimed to drag Zhou Litao into serious trouble, so she didn’t care about losing some money.

Anyway, she needed to do that at night, because it wasn’t convenient to carry out her plan during the day. Therefore, Gu Ning left and would come again at night.

…

In the afternoon, Song Wenxuan asked Gu Ning whether she was free. If she was, she could go to have a meal at the Song family’s place.

Gu Ning was free, so she brought Qiao Ya over. Because Gao Yi stayed with Song Wenxuan now, Gu Ning couldn’t leave Qiao Ya alone and let her eat alone.

The Song family was very polite to Gao Yi. They didn’t slight him just because he was a bodyguard. After all, Song Wenxuan relied on Gao Yi to make sure of his safety.

Song Wenxuan didn’t encounter any trouble today. Gu Ning arranged for Gao Yi to be with him, not because she foresaw something terrible might happen to him, but to avoid accidents.

Other members of the Song family were unaware of Gu Ning’s plan to frame Zhou Litao, because Gu Ning had told Song Wenxuan to keep it a secret between them.

It wasn’t because they didn’t trust other people, but because it wasn’t an honorable thing, and it was better if fewer people knew about it.

Gu Ning didn’t tell Song Wenxuan how exactly she was going to frame Zhou Litao. He only needed to know that she would frame Zhou Litao.

After the meal, it was dark, so Gu Ning and Qiao Ya left. Gao Yi, on the other hand, was Song Wenxuan’s bodyguard for the time being, so he stayed in the Song family’s place.

After Gu Ning and Qiao Ya left, Gu Ning told Qiao Ya to drive her to the residential area where Zhou Litao lived, then she got out of the car and told Qiao Ya to leave before her.

Afterwards, Gu Ning disguised herself as Tang Aining, then carried out her plan.

Even though there were surveillance cameras, there would still be blind spots, so Gu Ning avoided the surveillance cameras and went to the backyard of Zhou Litao’s house.

There weren’t many people in the Zhou family. At this moment, only seven people were at home, namely Zhou Litao, his wife, a son, a daughter, a nanny, and two security guards. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Because the security guards were in the front yard, Gu Ning got in from the backyard.

Zhou Litao’s family was watching TV in the living room, so there was no one on the second floor. The window wasn’t closed, so Gu Ning could do whatever she wanted.

She found the position of the study and glanced around. Although there were burglar bars, the window was open and Gu Ning would be able to put down what she needed to leave there.

After a jump, Gu Ning reached the window of the study, then she reached out and let the monster fox out of her telepathic eye space.

Afterwards, she took out what she wanted to leave in Zhou Litao’s study and told the monster fox to put it inside.

They were six gold bars, a small box of jewelry, two guns, and one kilogram of drugs.

She got the gold bars and jewelry from an ancient grave. Some of them were placed in her antique store, and some were kept in her telepathic eye space.

As for the guns, she got them from the Tianying Gang and hadn’t handed them to Leng Shaoting yet.

As for the drugs, she had given Leng Shaoting all the drugs she had found in the Tianying Gang’s base. She only kept a box of drugs which was used to frame her before, because she thought it might be useful one day.

Now, it indeed came to use.

If all the above stuff was exposed, Zhou Litao would be in serious trouble.

Gu Ning didn’t put all the above stuff together, but left them in different cabinets. Because she couldn’t open the safe, she couldn’t put them in it.

Once it was done, Gu Ning left Zhou Litao’s house and went to an unobtrusive small wood. She then used Tang Aining’s number to call Song Wenxuan and told him that everything was done. He could send people to come over with the excuse that he had received a report.

Song Wenxuan trusted Gu Ning, so he immediately called the deputy director of the Public Security Bureau and ordered him to search Zhou Litao’s house.

The deputy director of the Public Security Bureau, Xiong Xingyi, sided with Song Wenxuan, so he obeyed Song Wenxuan’s orders. Although it was an abuse of his power, he knew Song Wenxuan’s character very well. Song Wenxuan never wronged other people. Therefore, Song Wenxuan must be doing it for a reason and he also guessed it might be because Zhou Litao had something to do with his attempted assassination.
