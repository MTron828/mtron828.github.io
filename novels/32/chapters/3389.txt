3390 Even a Broken Clock Is Right Twice a Day

“Let’s go shopping! I didn’t bring much because I planned on buying clothes in the capital city,” said An Chenmeng.

An Chenmeng and Xiong Manxin bought a lot of clothes covering every need from head to toe, inside and out. Rich people never hesitated to spend money.

Because Leng Xiaoyao had just bought a lot of things, she didn’t buy anything else and just helped them carry their bags.

“I feel like we’re your boss now!” Xiong Manxin said to Leng Xiaoyao.

“Shh! Don’t say that, if the boss doesn’t carry our bags, we’re doomed.” An Chenmeng quickly reminded her.

“I already heard that.” Leng Xiaoyao’s voice sounded before Xiong Manxin could react. “So, you guys have to treat me to dinner.”

“No problem.” An Chenmeng and Xiong Manxin immediately agreed, afraid that Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t help them carry their bags.

After all, they bought a lot of things. It would be too heavy if only the two of them carried them.

After shopping, they went to a café to rest and have coffee.

It was then that Li Mochan called. He sounded very aggrieved. “Your grandfather and the others have all gone back. Why didn’t you contact me?”

Leng Xiaoyao somehow felt a little guilty for ignoring Li Mochan too much. “Um, I’m shopping with friends!”

“Can I treat you guys to dinner tonight?” Li Mochan asked.

“Okay! Let me ask them what they want to eat.” Leng Xiaoyao said, then asked An Chenmeng and Xiong Manxin, “What do you want to eat tonight?”

“You can make the decision!” An Chenmeng said.

“Yeah! You can decide.” Xiong Manxin agreed.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t know what to eat either, so she had to leave the decision to Li Mochan. “You can make the decision! Let me know when you’ve made a reservation. We’ll go over when it’s time.”

“Okay!” Li Mochan accepted his fate.

After hanging up the phone, An Chenmeng asked, “Who was that?”

“Why do I smell the scent of love?” Xiong Manxin squinted her eyes and looked at Leng Xiaoyao with a hint of ambiguity in her eyes. Although she didn’t know who the other person was, she heard a man’s voice.

An Chenmeng widened her eyes in surprise and asked, “Boss, do you really have a dog now?”

Upon hearing that it was Li Mochen, the two of them asked excitedly, “Are you two boyfriend and girlfriend now?”

Although they didn’t know what kind of person Li Mochen was, if he could make Leng Xiaoyao fall for him and accept him, he couldn’t be bad.

“I’m still considering it,” Leng Xiaoyao said somewhat nervously. Although they were already like a couple, she didn’t want to admit it yet because they had just started dating.

“What are you still considering? Mr. Li is handsome, rich, and if you keep hesitating, someone else might steal him away!” Xiong Manxin said anxiously. She was worried that Leng Xiaoyao might miss this great opportunity.

Although An Chenmeng also thought so at first, she disagreed with Xiong Manxin’s words after hearing that. “If he can be stolen away by others, he will be stolen away sooner or later. It’s better if he’s stolen away early so that our boss won’t suffer unnecessary harm!”

However, she still didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to miss this chance, so she added. “But boss, if you like Mr. Li too, don’t hesitate too long. This will make him think that you don’t like him. Not everyone will insist on possessing the person they like. There is a kind of love called letting go. Some people like you, but if they know that their liking brings you trouble and that you don’t like them the same way, they’ll give up because they like you and don’t want to make things difficult for you. Anyway, Mr. Li is handsome, attractive, and rich. You don’t dislike him, right?”

An Chenmeng was really worried that Leng Xiaoyao might not like Li Mochan!

“Yeah! What An Chenmeng said makes sense.” Xiong Manxin nodded heavily in agreement with An Chenmeng’s words.

Leng Xiaoyao curled her lips and said, “When did you become an expert in love?”

“Isn’t this common knowledge? It’s easier for outsiders to see clearly than those involved in the relationship. I’m afraid you’ll be lost in your own thoughts!” An Chenmeng said. Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t worried, but An Chenmeng was.

“Okay, I know what to do.” Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to discuss this topic with them any longer. The more they talked about it, the more guilty she felt. After all, she and Li Mochan were already together.

Although Leng Xiaoyao said this, An Chenmeng couldn’t help reminding her. “Boss, you’re still young. Even if Mr. Li isn’t a good choice, it doesn’t matter. After all, you won’t know what kind of person he is until you try it out. Be brave and face it. Don’t hesitate.”

“Just eat your food!” Leng Xiaoyao picked up a piece of bread. With a snap of her fingers, she accurately blocked An Chenmeng’s mouth with the bread.

Even An Chenmeng and Xiong Manxin, who knew how skilled Leng Xiaoyao was, were stunned by her actions.

It was not just them, others were surprised as well.

“Oh my god! Miss, your technique is too accurate! Is it skill or just a coincidence?” A man passing by their table stopped and asked in shock.

Before Leng Xiaoyao said anything, Xiong Manxin opened her mouth first. “Of course it’s real skill. Our boss is amazing.” She looked very proud.

“Humph! Even a broken clock is right twice a day.” The woman next to the man didn’t believe it and was full of hostility.

It was clear why she said that. She simply couldn’t stand seeing the man next to her paying attention to other women.

An Chenmeng was displeased. “What did you say?!”

“I wasn’t talking to you!” The woman sneered.

“Did you just look down on us?” said An Chenmeng. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Don’t make a connection!” the woman said disdainfully.

“You…!” An Chenmeng was so angry she wanted to hit her.

“You were obviously targeting us. Since you questioned me, let me prove it to you!” Leng Xiaoyao said coldly.

“You’re really amazing.” The man was impressed after witnessing the scene.

However, the woman was furious and pointed at Leng Xiaoyao, “How dare you attack me! Do you know who I am?”

“I didn’t attack you, I just gave you a cherry tomato. You aren’t injured, are you?” Leng Xiaoyao said innocently.
