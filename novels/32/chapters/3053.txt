3054 Mu Yiyang

Yu Shaoquan: Right. Then what’s the reason? Is it possible that Leng Xiaoyao didn’t actually like Jianan, and was just acting in the past. She deliberately disgusted Jianan and went back to normal after ending her engagement with Jianan?

Reading Yu Shaoquan’s words, Chu Jianan was angry. Although it was just a guess, Chu Jianan couldn’t accept it.

Qiu Zhenyu: But Jianan had hated her for a long time. Why did she only end the engagement with Jianan a short time ago?

Qui Zhenyu couldn’t figure it out.

!!

Chu Jianan: Alright, stop talking about Leng Xiaoyao. It’s annoying.

After Chu Jianan got mad, Qiu Zhenyu and Yu Shaoquan said nothing else.

Fang Haoming read their chat, but didn’t say anything.

At this moment, he was furious. He had almost made a full recovery now, and was ready to pay Leng Xiaoyao back, but unexpectedly Leng Xiaoyao became even more powerful.

It seemed that he had to turn to stronger people for help.

After knowing that Leng Xiaoyao rescued people from fire, Chu Jianan remembered that Leng Yuqi was with her last night. When the explosion broke out, Leng Yuqi must have been frightened. He wondered whether she was injured.

Chu Jianan wanted to chat with Leng Yuqi and ask her about her condition, but an idea dawned on him. In the explosion, Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t scared. If Leng Yuqi was, it would be humiliating.

In addition, Leng Xiaoyao rushed to rescue people, while Leng Yuqi must be stunned.

After the comparison, he suddenly felt that Leng Yuqi was barely comparable to Leng Xiaoyao, so he directly put down his phone.

Nevertheless, a while later, he still picked it up and sent Leng Yuqi a message.

Chu Jianan: Yuqi, I just heard that you encountered an explosion last night. Are you alright?

At this time, Leng Yuqi was having a class, but she read Chu Jianan’s message shortly after he sent it to her. In fact, she checked her phone once in a while to see whether Chu Jianan cared about her.

Therefore, when she saw Chu Jianan’s message, she was excited and immediately replied. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Leng Yuqi: I’m fine, but I was extremely scared then.

Leng Yuqi said she was scared because she wanted Chu Jianan to comfort her, but Chu Jianan felt she was difficult to please after reading her reply.

He totally forgot that he would be scared too if he had been there.

To his astonishment, he was already comparing Leng Yuqi with Leng Xiaoyao.

Chu Jianan: Glad to know that you’re fine.

Afterwards, he said nothing else and didn’t comfort Leng Yuqi.

Reading his new message, Leng Yuqi was disappointed. She waited for a while, but Chu Jianan still didn’t comfort her. As a result, she had a bee in her bonnet.

Did he feel she wasn’t comparable to Leng Xiaoyao since Leng Xiaoyao ran to rescue people while she was scared?

Nevertheless, she had been really frightened. No one knew Leng Xiaoyao could be so bold to even rescue people.

Thinking of that, Leng Yuqi was anxious and couldn’t focus on the class.

Leng Yuqi comforted herself and thought Chu Jianan might be busy with something, so he said nothing else, but she wasn’t dumb, so she couldn’t be fooled by stupid excuses.

…

After agreeing to catch Jin Dawu, Li Mochen immediately arranged for people to take action. In the early morning, right as Jin Dawu walked out of a clubhouse, he was caught.

He was found in the clubhouse last night, but they didn’t take action right away in order to stop other people from discovering it. After all, there were several important people behind Jin Dawu, so they shouldn’t alarm them.

The next morning, Mu Yiyang took the earliest flight to City Chang. As soon as Jin Dawu was caught, Mu Yiyang came to see Li Mochen.

The first person Mu Yiyang met in City Chang was Li Mochen instead of Lu Changwei.

Lu Changwei was fine now and had woken up that morning. He was also recovering, so Mu Yiyang decided to visit him later, but he needed to interrogate Jin Dawu as soon as possible.

Although they already knew who ordered Jin Dawu to do it, they still needed his confession.

Mu Yiyang was the same age as Li Mochen. He was also very handsome but he looked gentle. People might think that it was hard to understand him and that he was dangerous.

Only those who were familiar with him knew that he was easy to get along with and that he only looked mysterious in front of outsiders.

Especially when he was Li Mochen, he was quite respectful of him.

“Mochen, where is he?” Once Mu Yiyang saw Li Mochen, he asked urgently.

“He’s in the underground room,” Li Mochen said.

Li Mochen was in a house in a remote mountain currently. The house wasn’t owned by him, and was actually his friend’s. Normally, it was empty and was only used for vacation.

Li Mochen needed to stay in City Chang for a while, so he directly moved into the house. It wasn’t convenient for him to stay in a hotel after all.

He was a businessman and was very rich, but he didn’t have the habit of buying houses everywhere. He only had houses in cities he often visited.

“Take me to see him,” Mu Yiyang asked.

Then Li Mochen took Mu Yiyang to the underground room.

Jin Dawu was a man about forty years old. He was tall and strong.

He used to be a professional enforcer, but was put in jail after raping a girl and disabling her boyfriend.

He wasn’t sentenced to death, but was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Therefore, when the deputy warden, Zhang Zengxu, came to ask him for help, he quickly agreed.

After he did it, it was up to him whether he would be caught again or successfully escape.

Anyway, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. He couldn’t leave the prison if he didn’t agree. If he agreed, he could have a chance to be free. He wasn’t dumb and knew which was the better choice.

However, Jin Dawu was addicted to sex and didn’t escape right away. He still went to a clubhouse in City Chang for fun.

Perhaps he thought the most dangerous place was the safest place.

Honestly, even if he ran away, he would still be caught by Li Mochen sooner or later.

...

Now, Jin Dawu was tied to a chair in the underground room. His mouth was sealed with tape and he could barely move.
