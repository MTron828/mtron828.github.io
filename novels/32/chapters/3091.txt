3093 Visit An Chenmeng

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t think one could disguise herself so well, so she was convinced that Shen Xiyin didn’t know the jade pendant was harmful.

“Is she possessed by a ghost or something?” Leng Xiaoyao guessed, staring at Shen Xiyin to observe her reaction.

“Possessed by a ghost?” Shen Xiyin was shocked and couldn’t believe it. “No way! That can’t be real!”

“Who knows! But I think it’s better to think of all the possibilities. After all, it has happened before. I’ve experienced it before, otherwise I wouldn’t have had that idea,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t move her eyes away from Shen Xiyin’s face in order to not miss any changes in her expression.

“R-Really? Can it really happen? That’s scary!” Shen Xiyin said, showing real fright. It seemed she had never heard of that before.

“Why don’t we go visit her?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Sure! After hearing that she’s sick, I should pay her a visit, but Chenjun doesn’t have time and I can’t do it alone. After all, I’ve only visited the An family once before. But we can go there together,” Shen Xiyin said.

Even though Leng Xiaoyao said that she had conflicts with An Chenmeng, she also said that An Chenmeng wanted to join them after she defeated her. In other words, there was no grudges between them, so it wasn’t wrong for Leng Xiaoyao to visit An Chenmeng.

Perhaps An Chenmeng would be happy if Leng Xiaoyao went to see her.

Shen Xiyin added. “But can I tell Chenjun about it before we go? I think he should know.”

“Of course,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Anyway, given Shen Xiyin’s reaction, Leng Xiaoyao was convinced that she was innocent. However, she didn’t tell Shen Xiyin that the jade pendant was harmful right away. She decided to wait till they visited An Chenmeng.

After eating, Shen Xiyin called An Chenjun and told him that she would go to visit An Chenmeng with Leng Xiaoyao.

When An Chenjun heard that Leng Xiaoyao went to the same school as An Chenmeng, he was extremely surprised too. He always thought Leng Xiaoyao was a college student, but since she knew An Chenmeng, there was nothing wrong if she wanted to see An Chenmeng.

An Chenjun was only afraid that Shen Xiyin might be nervous if he wasn’t with her. After all, during her first visit to his family, she was very nervous even though he was with her.

Shen Xiyin undoubtedly would be nervous and uncomfortable, but An Chenjun needed to work. She couldn’t ask him to leave work, since it would be immature.

Since she wanted to go see An Chenmeng, she had to be sincere.

Therefore, she said she was fine and that she wouldn’t go alone. She would go with Leng Xiaoyao.

Since she said that, An Chenjun said nothing else. Anyway, his parents had a very good impression of Shen Xiyin. They wouldn’t make things difficult for her.

After that, Leng Xiaoyao and Shen Xiyin went to the An family’s mansion. Before going there, they prepared gifts.

On their way, Leng Xiaoyao chatted with Shen Xiyin, but she didn’t feel Shen Xiyin out this time. It wasn’t enough to know Shen Xiyin, she needed to know about her from other aspects.

After they reached the An family’s mansion, Leng Xiaoyao left her jade in Shen Xiyin’s car. Anyway, they stopped the car in the An family’s yard, so no one would steal them.

…

After An Chenjun hung up the call with Shen Xiyin, he told his parents that Shen Xiyin would be coming to see An Chenmeng. In case they weren’t home, it was better to tell them beforehand.

Because it was a weekend, An Chenmeng and her parents were home.

Because An Chenmeng wasn’t comfortable, she needed to rest at home and her parents stayed to take care of her.

An Chenmeng’s parents were very sad when she was so sick, but they couldn’t do anything about it.

Knowing that Shen Xiyin and Leng Xiaoyao were coming to see them, An Chenmeng’s parents were very happy.

Although they disliked Leng Xiaoyao before, Leng Xiaoyao had totally changed and they were impressed by her.

An Chenmeng was also excited when she heard Leng Xiaoyao was coming to see her. However, she felt a little awkward afterward, but she welcomed them.

However, if An Chenmeng’s mother didn’t see her excited face, her mother would think she didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to come.

“What happened? Don’t you want Leng Xiaoyao to come to see you? Didn’t you always say you want to join them?” Mrs. An asked on purpose.

“Of course I want her to come, but I’m surprised. She said she wouldn’t accept me no matter what happened. Why would she bother to come to see me? There is no relationship between us!” An Chenmeng said in frustration.

The more An Chenmeng behaved like that, the more her mother believed she really cared about Leng Xiaoyao’s visit. If Leng Xiaoyao weren’t a girl, she might even think that An Chenmeng fell in love with Leng Xiaoyao. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

In fact, An Chenmeng loved kung fu, so it was normal that she admired Leng Xiaoyao very much.

Even An Chenmeng’s parents admired Leng Xiaoyao.

After all, Leng Xiaoyao became an excellent student and was the top scorer of the monthly test, with a total score of 747 points.

If An Chenmeng could be friends with Leng Xiaoyao, An Chenmeng might be affected by Leng Xiaoyao and could make progress in her studies.

Although they wouldn’t force An Chenmeng to be an excellent student, it was good if she could be good at studying. It wouldn’t do any harm.

Moreover, Leng Xiaoyao was skilled at martial arts. She dared to rescue people from a fire after an explosion and the man she had rescued turned out to be Secretary Lu Changwei.

Given her brave deed, it was enough to win people’s respect. After all, there were rarely people who could be so brave and had a sense of justice.

“Alright, since she is coming to see you, she must see you as a friend. Otherwise she wouldn’t bother to come. Like you just said, there is no relationship between you.” Mrs. An comforted An Chenmeng. She believed that Leng Xiaoyao cared about An Chenmeng so she came to see her. On the other hand, none of An Chenmeng’s friends paid her a visit.

“Really?” An Chenmeng was excited. Did Leng Xiaoyao really see her as a friend?

At her age, she knew little about romance, but she cared a lot about friendship. In her eyes, friends were very important.

Honestly, she was a typical teenage girl.
