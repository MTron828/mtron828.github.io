They weren’t familiar with City Teng, so they followed the GPS, driving to a famous local restaurant.

Of course, they made a reservation on the phone before they went there. The restaurant was extremely popular, but it wasn’t big and only had 10 private rooms along with 10 tables in the hall. Thus it was hard to get a reservation from 6 pm to 7 pm when most people had dinner. And the restaurant was always full of people.

Luckily, Gu Ning reserved the final private room and they would arrive there after 10 minutes.

“Don’t you need to fulfill you task? Why do you still have time to be with me?” Gu Ning asked Leng Shaoting.

“Well, actually I didn’t need to join them this time, but because of you, I came here,” Leng Shaoting told Gu Ning the truth and she was touched.

“Where will you stay tonight?” Gu Ning asked. Somehow she felt nervous and anticipated the answer. She had to admit that she was looking forward to spending the whole night with him.

“I’ll stay with you,” Leng Shaoting said naturally.

Gu Ning flushed a little and didn’t know what to say next.

Gu Ning’s silence made Leng Shaoting think that she was mad. He was anxious and asked, “Aren’t you willing to stay with me?”

“Of course I am,” Gu Ning said at once.

Hearing that Leng Shaoting relaxed.

A few minutes later, they arrived, and the hall was filled with people. Many were even waiting outside for empty seats.

This small restaurant wasn’t a fancy hotel at all, but it had its own special style of decoration. Many rich people also came here due to its delicious food.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went straight to their reserved private room. However, just as they walked into the passage, they heard a noisy argument from inside the private room.

“Miss Wang, I’m sorry. This private room has already been reserved. Please wait for a little while longer.” the hotel manager said politely.

“No! I don’t care who reserved it. I want it now!” a female voice said arrogantly.

Gu Ning immediately recognized the voice. The female was Wang Xinyan.

To Gu Ning’s surprise, they met each other in an argument once more. Wang Xinyan enjoyed grabbing things from others so much that she just grabbed the raw material from Gu Ning today and now she tried to grab Gu Ning’s reserved private room.

“Miss Wang, please don’t cause us trouble,” the manager said resignedly.

“How come I’m the one who is causing trouble here? I’m the daughter of the Wang Family. It’s your honor that I choose to dine here. If you dare to stop me again, I can make you close your restaurant!” Wang Xinyan threatened.

“Exactly! How dare you act against the Wang Family?” Several boys and girls who were standing along with Wang Xinyan supported her orally.

“You...” The manager was annoyed but indeed didn’t dare to argue with her any longer.

At this time, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting walked in. “We have reserved this private room, do you want to grab it from us?”

“So what?” Wang Xinyan looked over saying with disdain. However, when her gaze fell on Leng Shaoting, she was stunned by his extraordinarily handsome appearance.

He’s so handsome! Wang Xinyan thought to herself. She had never met such a handsome man before! Even those male idols or stars were barely comparable to him.

Gu Ning understood that Leng Shaoting’s appearance was super attractive to girls wherever he went, but she was uncomfortable when those girls fixed their eyes at Leng Shaoting. Anyway, Leng Shaoting was her boyfriend, and those girls could do nothing about it. However, when Wang Xinyan made eyes at Leng Shaoting, Gu Ning was extremely displeased, because she already disliked Wang Xinyan.

Seeing Leng Shaoting, Wang Xinyan forgot to argue with Gu Ning, but stepped towards Leng Shaoting directly.

“Hi, nice to meet you. My name is Wang Xinyan. I’m the daughter of the Wang Family, which is one of the four most powerful families in City Teng,” Wang Xinyan said with great pride while holding out her hand to Leng Shaoting.

However, Leng Shaoting remained expressionless, as if Wang Xinyan didn’t exist. Wang Xinyan felt embarrassed and snapped, “Hey! I’m talking to you! Are you dumb?”

Leng Shaoting still ignored her, and stayed calm, but Gu Ning couldn’t tolerate it anymore. She squinted and warned, “Mind your words. Stay away from my man, b*tch.”

“How dare you say that to me?” Wang Xinyan was irritated.

“You deserve it,” Gu Ning said.

“You...” Wang Xinyan was mad.

“What do you think you are? How dare you humiliate Miss Wang? Do you know how powerful the Wang Family is?” a girl who was with Wang Xinyan threatened.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting finally reacted. He gave the girl a cold sharp glance, and the girl was frightened. She could barely breathe now. All the other people who were with Wang Xinyan felt threatened. This man wasn’t someone that they could mess with.

“The Wang Family? I don’t care about the Wang Family! No matter who you are, if you dare to humiliate Ningning, I’ll unseat your whole family,” Leng Shaoting said icily, which scared everyone a lot. Their first reaction wasn’t to doubt Leng Shaoting’s words; they were truly afraid that he would unseat the Wang Family, because Leng Shaoting had an air of power.

Wang Xinyan had always been arrogant, and was used to being flattered by people around her, so she didn’t believe that the man before her eyes could hurt the Wang Family. “Who do you think you are? Do you really think that you have the ability to unseat the Wang Family?”
