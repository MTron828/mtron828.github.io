Chapter 1062 Help Xue Suxiu

Gu Ning, Leng Shaoting and Zheng Peng left the factory at 5 pm for dinner.Coincidentally, they met Xue Suxiu again at the restaurant.

There was a man following Xue Suxiu; he must be her secretary.

There was another middle-aged man and a young woman with Xue Suxiu, and the young woman was obviously the middle-aged man’s secretary.

It dawned on Gu Ning that women always had male secretaries, while men often had female secretaries.

Xue Suxiu didn’t see them, so Gu Ning didn’t greet her.

However, Gu Ning noticed something abnormal in the middle-aged man’s eyes.

It seemed that this man was going to trap Xue Suxiu, but it had nothing to do with her, so she didn’t pay much attention to them.

After a short while, Gu Ning found that Xue Suxiu was dining in the next room.

Because she thought that the middle-aged man behaved strangely, she used her Jade Eyes to see what they were doing in the next room.

She was right. Gu Ning caught Xue Suxiu’s secretary secretly put a pill into her glass when he was pouring wine for her.

It turned out that both the middle-aged man and Xue Suxiu’s secretary planned to hurt her.

“Uncle Zheng, do you have Ms. Xue’s phone number?” Gu Ning asked all of a sudden.

“Yes, I do,” Zheng Peng said, and took out his phone at once.

“Please call her right now. I have something to tell her,” Gu Ning said in an urgent tone.

She was reluctant to get involved in another person’s personal affairs, but she should do something since she already found out the dirty trick.

“Sure.” Zheng Peng called Xue Suxiu without delay, then handed his phone to Gu Ning.

Leng Shaoting glanced at Gu Ning. He knew that she did it for a reason.

In the next room, Xue Suxiu just raised the glass and was about to have a drink, but her phone rang at this moment. She said something to the middle-aged man, then picked up the call.

Gu Ning felt relieved.

“Hi, Mr. Zheng,” Xue Suxiu said.

“Ms. Xue, it’s me, Gu Ning,” Gu Ning said.

Xue Suxiu was surprised.

“Oh, hi, may I help?” Xue Suxiu asked.

“I just saw you in XX Restaurant, but you were with your friends, so I didn’t greet you. I just thought of something important, can I talk with you for a minute right now? I’m in No.666 room,” Gu Ning said. “Please come alone.”

Xue Suxiu didn’t understand why Gu Ning suddenly called her, but she knew that it must be something important. Therefore, she agreed. “No problem, I’m coming.”

...

After hanging up the call, Xue Suxiu said to the middle-aged man, “Mr. Zhang, I’m so sorry. The boss of Colorful Jade Provider is in the next room right now, and she needs to see me for a while. I’ll be back in a few minutes.”

“Sure,” the middle-aged man said, and didn’t think further. He believed that nobody would find out his dirty trick.

After that, Xue Suxiu stood up and left.

Someone knocked on the door of the private room where Gu Ning stayed, and Gu Ning opened the door in person.

“Hi, Miss Gu, Mr. Zheng!” Xue Suxiu greeted Gu Ning and Zheng Peng after she walked inside. She didn’t know Leng Shaoting, so she didn’t greet him.

Leng Shaoting didn’t know Xue Suxiu either, so he remained silent.

“Ms Xue, I noticed something strange with the middle-aged man who came here with you. The young man by your side exchanged glances with the middle-aged man too. I have a bad feeling and I think that you should be careful. You better not drink or eat tonight,” Gu Ning said.

Xue Suxiu wasn’t dumb, and she realized what would happen to her the moment Gu Ning said that. In fact, she had a premonition herself when her boss assigned the middle-aged man to be the vice president.

The middle-aged man didn’t get along with her, so she was worried that he might scheme against her someday. However, she hadn’t found any solid proof yet.

To her astonishment, her secretary was also involved in this.

She wasn’t sure whether her secretary had already betrayed her because the young man had worked for her for several years. She decided to investigate later. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Seeing Xue Suxiu’s reaction, Gu Ning understood that she must have suspicions of the middle-aged man.

“Miss Gu, thank you so much for telling me that,” Xue Suxiu said with sincerity, but the problem was that she couldn’t leave right now. Even though she knew she was in a dangerous situation now, she had no evidence.

Besides, the dishes could have nothing harmful inside.

“You’re welcome. I just have a bad feeling and I hope that you can stay safe. I understand that you can’t leave right now. If you trust me, you can take this pill. If there really is something harmful in the drink or dishes, it can protect you,” Gu Ning said, and took out a porcelain bottle from her backpack.

Xue Suxiu was surprised and held doubts.

Anyway, since Gu Ning was kind enough to remind her to be careful, Gu Ning wouldn’t hurt her, so she accepted it. “Thanks, Miss Gu.”

“Be careful,” Gu Ning said.

“I will,” Xue Suxiu said.

Before she left, she stared at the bottle with hesitation for a while, but still opened it at the end and took the pill inside.

The pill melted the second it was put into her mouth, and she felt quite comfortable.
