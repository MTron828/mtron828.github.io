Chapter 2352: Who Should Do That?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning walked to the door of the chamber, but she didn’t rush in. She observed it thoroughly first.

This tomb chamber was very large, about fifty square meters. In front of the stone door, there was a canal about two and a half meters in width, but there was no bridge, so they had to jump over by themselves.

It was very difficult for ordinary people to do that. With the help of the five meters long road before the canal, Ma Shibiao could jump over, but his subordinates weren’t able to.

Two of them were injured, and the uninjured one looked weak. On the other hand, it couldn’t be easier for Gu Ning and Nicholas to jump over the canal.

They couldn’t swim over, because there were strange creatures in it. They floated on the surface of the water now, so it was impossible for them to swim over.

Looking at this canal, Ma Shibiao frowned. “Can we jump over?”

Given his abilities, he thought that he could, but he still had worries. Even if he jumped over, how should he get back with treasures later?

He couldn’t throw the treasures over, because they were fragile. They would be worthless if they were broken.

“You look skilled. It shouldn’t be difficult for you.” Gu Ning mocked.

Ma Shibiao was displeased, but he knew that it wasn’t a problem for Gu Ning to jump over. He didn’t want to embarrass himself by arguing with her.

“Little fox, go over before us. There must be more hidden weapons. Have a try, then come back right away. Don’t waste time there, and don’t get injured,” said Gu Ning. She decided to let the monster fox test it first.

The monster fox was very agile, so Gu Ning wasn’t worried about it.

Without delay, the monster fox flew over, easily crossing the canal, and landed on the ground opposite.

The moment the monster fox touched the ground, arrows were immediately launched from all directions to where the monster fox was standing. There were more than the arrows Gu Ning had dealt with earlier.

Witnessing that, Ma Shibiao and the other men were scared. If they just jumped over, they might not be able to handle it and the arrows would pierce into their bodies.

The monster fox, however, avoided all the arrows and immediately jumped back. As soon as it was back, the flying arrows stopped.

The mechanism in the tomb chamber was inductive. As long as there was an intrusion, it would activate the mechanism and launch hidden weapons.

“How many hidden weapons are there?” Ma Shibiao asked. He wasn’t particularly asking Gu Ning; he was just wondering.

“We can just continue to test it. When it stops, it’s over,” said Gu Ning.

“There are too many flying arrows. Who can do the test?” Ma Shibiao said. It was obvious that he wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t order his subordinates to do it either.

Gu Ning understood what Ma Shibiao was implying. She sneered and said, “We can throw something over.”

There were too many flying arrows so Gu Ning was unwilling to do the test alone. Even if she had to jump over and could handle it, she was reluctant to let Ma Shibiao and the other men share what she earned by doing nothing.

“Sure, let’s throw something over.” Ma Shibiao agreed at once.

“Do it now. Take your valuable stuff out first. Then throw your backpack over. You can do it one by one. If it’s too light or too few, it might not be able to test the hidden weapons,” said Gu Ning. Ma Shibiao agreed, but he still did nothing.

Gu Ning didn’t know whether something light could trigger the hidden weapons, and she purposely wanted to make them throw more stuff over.

Ma Shibiao stopped hesitating and told one of his subordinates to do it first.

The subordinate didn’t dare to waste time. There was nothing valuable in his backpack, and they carried guns on them, so he directly threw his backpack over. However, nothing happened after his backpack fell to the ground.

“Why?” Ma Shibiao asked.

“Perhaps it’s too light. Throw another backpack over,” said Gu Ning. She thought that she might have guessed correctly. If it was too light, it couldn’t trigger the hidden weapons. Therefore, another man threw his backpack over. There were some tools inside, so it was a little heavier.

Once the backpack touched the ground, flying arrows shot out again. Countless arrows hitting the backpack. It didn’t stop until nearly two hundred flying arrows were shot.

After observation, Gu Ning came up with a guess that every block on the ground was a hidden weapon’s mechanism. Once the mechanism of this block was triggered, hidden weapons would be fired, and it would stop when it was touched next time.

The ground was made of nine-square divisions.

In order to prove her guess, Gu Ning told the monster fox to jump over to the place it had just touched. She told it not to touch any other blocks.

The monster fox obeyed her order and jumped over to the same place.

Because the monster fox quickly came back after its first jump, there were still a lot of arrows left and they shot out this time.

Although the monster fox could avoid them, it was very dangerous.

There were too many sharp arrows, while it could only protect itself from being shot within a block about two square meters big. If it touched another block by accident, more arrows would be shot at it.

After over a hundred arrows were fired out, it stopped. Added with those that were shot out last time, there should be about two hundred arrows. Accordingly, Gu Ning was sure that each block could fire about two hundred arrows. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When the monster fox got back, Gu Ning told it to jump over once more. She told it to step on the same block it just touched.

Gu Ning was right. After the monster fox touched the same block, there were no more arrows.

Ma Shibiao and the other men, however, thought there were no more hidden weapons. They were very excited. “It’s amazing. There are no more hidden weapons.”

“No, I think only the two blocks where the fox and the backpacks are won’t fire any more hidden weapons. There should be more hidden in other places. It’s a nine-square division. After my test, I guess that each block is a trigger. The hidden weapons won’t stop hitting us until all the traps have been triggered.”

“What?” Ma Shibiao was shocked.

In that case, there were seven blocks left, but they didn’t have enough things to trigger the traps!
