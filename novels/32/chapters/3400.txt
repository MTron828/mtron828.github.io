3402 Encounter Ghosts During Cultivation

After leaving Leng Xiaoyao’s office, they all posted on their social media accounts, causing envy and jealousy among many people.

They asked Mu Beihan where Xiao Yuming was and wanted to meet him, but they didn’t get a reply from her.

Nevertheless, many acquaintances called Mu Beihan. At first she answered, but later she stopped answering because there were too many to deal with.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t let Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai leave, so they went to dinner together later.

It was still early, and Xiao Yuming had nothing else to do, so he just stayed at Xiaoyao Technology and chatted with everyone. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

At first, An Chenmeng and the others were very nervous, but they gradually relaxed and started playing the game together. The game was really fun.

“Leng Xiaoyao, this game will definitely be popular.” Xiao Yuming’s tone became even more certain. He was a game enthusiast and knew whether a game was good or not.

He even wanted to start a technology company and develop a game himself, but his technical skills were limited, so he asked Li Mochen for help. Li Mochen refused, saying he wasn’t interested, so he started an entertainment company instead.

“I know.” Leng Xiaoyao had no idea what modesty meant.

Xiao Yuming was taken aback. “You’re not modest at all!”

“My boss is just being honest. She has many other amazing abilities,” An Chenmeng said. Her admiration for Leng Xiaoyao was nearly blind.

Xiao Yuming thought about what Leng Xiaoyao was capable of and felt that it was true. This girl was indeed amazing! She couldn’t be judged by the standards of an ordinary person.

An hour later, Li Mochen came to the company and joined everyone in playing the game.

When it was time for dinner, they went out to eat.

Xiao Yuming paid for the meal to thank Leng Xiaoyao for giving him the jade.

After spending time with Xiao Yuming for a long while, Mu Beihan and the others had relaxed enough to order without hesitation.

Song Xinyue was an exception.

She always felt that she didn’t fit in with them. She envied them, but she wasn’t jealous nor did she feel unbalanced. She had her own ideals.

After dinner, Leng Xiaoyao had Mu Yufan send Mu Beihan home, while she and Li Mochen sent An Chenmeng and the others back to school.

When An Chenmeng returned to the dormitory, she was immediately surrounded by her roommates asking about Xiao Yuming.

Her roommates kept asking, but An Chenmeng didn’t want to say more. After all, Leng Xiaoyao had said that she couldn’t say too much.

Instead of going back to Hanlin Manor, Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen went to a remote mountain to cultivate. They hadn’t cultivated for some time, so they had to pay more attention to it.

Leng Xiaoyao was also anxious. Calculating the time left, they only had a year and a half. So she had to recover her abilities as a cultivator within a year, then she could go to Guiyun with Li Mochen.

A night of cultivation might not be very helpful, but they needed to make progress.

However, when they arrived at the mountain, before they could even start cultivating, they sensed movement and yin energy in the mountain.

“Could it be ghosts fighting?” Leng Xiaoyao guessed instinctively.

“It’s possible. Let’s go take a look. If they have a high level of cultivation, we can also practice our skills!” Li Mochen said with some excitement.

When he sparred with Leng Xiaoyao, he was worried about hurting her so he was sometimes still a little hesitant.

When fighting with other monsters and ghosts, there was no need for any hesitation.

“Okay!” Leng Xiaoyao also felt very excited.

The two quickly approached and confirmed that it was indeed two ghosts fighting. They were one male and one female.

They were Black Shadow Ghosts, with a danger rating of four stars. For Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen, they were not a threat, but it wouldn’t be easy to deal with them either. It was more likely that they would end up in a draw.

In that case, they could fully enjoy fighting them.

To avoid hurting each other, they usually didn’t fight with all their might. However, today, Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen didn’t waste any time and appeared directly in front of the ghosts.

The two ghosts were surprised that Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen had found them. They hadn’t thought that these humans wouldn’t be afraid of them. They immediately stopped.

“These two humans aren’t afraid?” the female ghost said. It was obviously displeased. It felt that they were being underestimated.

“Humph! Just two Black Shadow Ghosts, what is there to be afraid of?” Leng Xiaoyao said arrogantly.

“You can see us?”

The two ghosts were surprised and wary.

If they could see them and said they weren’t afraid, then they couldn’t be ordinary.

However, they didn’t find anything special about them. They were no different from ordinary mortals!

“Who are you?” the male ghost asked.

“People who specialize in dealing with monsters and ghosts,” Leng Xiaoyao said, looking provocatively at the male ghost.

Therefore, the male ghost also attacked Li Mochen.

After fighting, the two Black Shadow Ghosts realized that their opponents were actually cultivators.

The two sides were evenly matched for a long time, which surprised the two Black Shadow Ghosts.

They were surprised because they didn’t expect their opponents’ cultivation level to be so high that they could match them.

Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen also despised them because they had just boasted but couldn’t do anything to them.

Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen couldn’t defeat the two Black Shadow Ghosts for the time being, but they enjoyed the fight.

After several hours of fighting, both sides were greatly exhausted.

“Anyway, you can’t do anything to us. Why not just let us go?” the male ghost said. It suggested letting them go because their cultivation levels were similar and it was uncertain who would win in the end. It would be better for them to stop!

“Are you begging for mercy?” Leng Xiaoyao sneered.

“You…” The male ghost was angry.

“Since they don’t want to stop, we’ll fight until the end,” the female ghost said coldly.

“You can tell us, after becoming ghosts, have you ever killed anyone?” Leng Xiaoyao asked. She wasn’t someone who killed indiscriminately. If they hadn’t killed anyone, she wouldn’t have to kill them.
