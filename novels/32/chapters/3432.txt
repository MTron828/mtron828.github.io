3435 Just a Game

After two days of hesitation on whether to take further action against Leng Xiaoyao, Brother Bao eventually found another bunch of people to deal with the situation. However, it wasn’t a direct attack on Leng Xiaoyao, but rather an attack on Mu Yufan.

Manager was the general manager of Leng Xiaoyao’s company. Brother Bao believed that if they could take down Mu Yufan, Leng Xiaoyao would be easy to capture.

When Leng Xiaoyao received a call from Brother Bao at 8 pm, she had already finished her dinner and was taking a walk in the community.

The call came from Mu Yufan’s phone, so Leng Xiaoyao thought that it was Mu Yufan calling.

“What’s up?” Leng Xiaoyao said once she answered the call.

“He-he, Miss Leng, this is Brother Bao. Currently the general manager of your company is visiting me! So, I also wanted to invite you to share tea and talk about some things. I hope that you give me the honor! And please come alone. Don’t bring anyone else with you! We are at the Old Place Nightclub. I’ll have someone wait for you at the gate,” Brother Bao said, without any direct threats. Instead he used soft threats in an extremely polite tone.

Leng Xiaoyao’s expression was cold. She had already warned him, but he still dared to trouble her, so this time she was going to punish him.

“Okay.” Leng Xiaoyao replied, hung up the phone directly, then immediately drove towards Old Place Nightclub.

On the night when Lao Gui followed her, she investigated Brother Bao, so she knew where Old Place Nightclub was. She was aware that it was Brother Bao’s territory. Actually, he just guarded it. It didn’t really belong to him.

Brother Bao was a gangster, and generally he wouldn’t give up easily for what he wanted. Therefore, after Leng Xiaoyao received a call from Brother Bao, although she was angry, she wasn’t surprised.

Brother Bao, however, was surprised that Leng Xiaoyao agreed so readily, but he was happy about it. He was worried that she would refuse.

In one of the private rooms at the nightclub, Brother Bao sat in the middle of the sofa with five bodyguards on each side, totaling eleven people.

Mu Yufan was tied to a chair in the corner of the room with his mouth gagged. No matter how he struggled, he couldn’t get free.

He was angry because he knew he was being used to lure his boss over.

He didn’t blame Leng Xiaoyao for getting him in trouble, but was angry that Brother Bao dared to cause trouble for his boss.

He was also angry at himself for being so careless and letting them catch him.

He knew that Leng Xiaoyao was very skilled, but he still worried. After all, this was Brother Bao’s territory, and his men were everywhere.

“He-he! It seems like you have a lot of importance in your boss’s eyes! She agreed to come so willingly.” Brother Bao teased Mu Yufan. He wasn’t worried that Leng Xiaoyao would dare to call for backup because this was his territory.

Mu Yufan glared at Brother Bao, wishing that he could kill him.

Brother Bao wasn’t angry and didn’t even take him seriously. He didn’t even hit him because he wanted to talk to Leng Xiaoyao first.

If he used violence from the beginning and completely angered Leng Xiaoyao, he might not have a chance to negotiate.

What he didn’t know was that no matter what he did, Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t give him a chance to negotiate because she was so angry that she decided to destroy the Old Place Nightclub.

Leng Xiaoyao soon arrived at the Old Place Nightclub. There was a man standing outside who recognized her from her photo.

She was so beautiful and had an air of nobility that the man’s eyes lit up with greed at once.

If he could be with such a rare woman, it would be a wonderful thing!

However, he only lusted after the woman that Brother Bao was interested in. He was too cowardly to act on his desires.

“Are you Miss Leng?” the man asked, even though he recognized her.

“Yes.” Leng Xiaoyao replied coldly.

“Please follow me,” the man said politely, leading Leng Xiaoyao to Brother Bao’s private room.

As soon as she entered the Old Place Nightclub, Leng Xiaoyao used her magical senses to scan the area and found out many things.

There were drug users and people having a orgy [1.a wild gathering marked by promiscuous sexual activity, excessive drinking, etc.]. There were even many people watching porn together. It was chaotic.

Anyway, this wasn’t a legitimate place to begin with, so most people who came here were bad.

However, opening this kind of nightclub in the capital city hadn’t been banned. It seemed that the person who backed Old Place Nightclub was powerful. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Nevertheless, Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t afraid.

Even before the man led her to Brother Bao’s private room, Leng Xiaoyao had already used her magical senses to confirm that Mu Yufan wasn’t injured.

The man brought Leng Xiaoyao to the private room that Brother Bao was in. Without knocking on the door, he just pushed it open and walked in.

Brother Bao had only seen a photo of Leng Xiaoyao and was already mesmerized by her beauty, so when he saw her in person, he was dumbfounded.

Mu Yufan was worried when he saw that Leng Xiaoyao really came alone, but after she gave him a reassuring look, he felt relieved.

He knew that his boss wasn’t reckless and must have a way of handling things if she came alone.

“I didn’t expect Miss Leng to be even more beautiful in person. You truly are stunning!” Brother Bao was ecstatic. If this woman became his, it would be a great thing!

“Please have a seat, Miss Leng,” Brother Bao said politely. He was truly being a gentleman in front of such a beauty.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t sit down. She just looked at Brother Bao coolly and asked, “What do you mean by this invitation, Brother Bao? Is this all you wanted?”

As she said that, she looked towards Mu Yufan.

Brother Bao was taken aback and quickly said, “He-he! It’s just a misunderstanding! I just wanted to play a game with Mr. Mu.”

He then turned to his men and ordered them to release Mu Yufan. “Go free Mr. Mu!”

Since this was his territory, there was no need for him to worry about letting Mu Yufan go.

Brother Bao’s people immediately freed Mu Yufan.

Mu Yufan came over to Leng Xiaoyao as soon as he was released. Although he trusted her, he couldn’t help worrying.

“Why did you call me here?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“He-he! Miss Leng, I’m so impressed by your beauty that I want to become friends with you,” Brother Bao said, his eyes revealing his lust.
