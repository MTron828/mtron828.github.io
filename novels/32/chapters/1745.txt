Chapter 1746: Not Problems

“How will you put me into your space?” The monster fox was alert. What if Gu Ning wouldn’t let it out after putting it into the space? Although it wasn’t very likely, it was still worried. After all, one could never be too careful.

“Since we’ve reached the agreement, I definitely won’t hurt you,” said Gu Ning.

“Great.” If so, the monster fox didn’t bother to ask further about it.

Afterwards, Gu Ning walked to the monster fox. She touched its head and it disappeared the next second and went into Gu Ning’s telepathic eye space.

When everything was done, it was almost 11 pm. Gu Ning was afraid that Jing Yunyao might worry if she went back to Mountain River Garden so late, so she called Leng Shaoting. She told him that she still had something to deal with tonight and didn’t want to worry Jing Yunyao if she went back too late, so she wouldn’t go back tonight, and would meet them tomorrow.

Because Gu Ning was still busy dealing with something so late, Leng Shaoting asked her what she was busy with. He wasn’t suspicious of Gu Ning, but didn’t want Gu Ning to be tired.

Gu Ning didn’t keep it secret from Leng Shaoting, and told him that she had been busy dealing with the male ghost and the monster fox. They were well handled, and she was going to see Tang Bingsen next.

Leng Shaoting was aware of Gu Ning’s grudge against Tang Bingsen, but all he knew was what Gu Ning had told him so he didn’t know any details.

Leng Shaoting asked Gu Ning whether she needed his help.

Gu Ning said that she didn’t need his help, and Leng Shaoting didn’t insist. In fact, Jing Yunyao wouldn’t be worried even if Gu Ning came back late, so Leng Shaoting still persuaded her to come back to Mountain River Garden tonight.

Gu Ning thought for a while, then agreed.

After having the call with Leng Shaoting, Gu Ning got in the car and disguised herself as “Tang Aining” before she left.

In order to not expose herself, Gu Ning put the car into her telepathic eye space when she had almost entered the area with surveillance cameras. After that, she walked to the roadside and took a taxi to the hospital where Tang Bingsen stayed.

It was nearly 12 am when she arrived.

Tang Bingsen was seriously injured this time, so he had to stay in the hospital for a long time. Luckily, his life wasn’t in danger and he stayed clear-minded.

Ji Yijing, unfortunately was quite exhausted these days, because she had to take care of Tang Bingsen and Tang Yaxin at the same time. Tang Bingsen had his secretary and two mercenaries to protect him, so Ji Yijing would go back to Tang Yaxin’s side at night.

Tang Yaxin was still unconscious from a serious illness. Although her life was out of danger before, it was still possible that she wouldn’t survive this time.

Ji Yijing almost had a breakdown when both her daughter and husband were in trouble. She was worried about their family’s business if both of them couldn’t become healthy again. Even though she had a small business, she was unable to run a business group like the Tang Organization. She honestly didn’t know what she could do if Tang Bingsen had to stay in the bed all the time.

If Tang Bingsen couldn’t get back to his feet, she was definitely no match for those experienced directors in the Tang Organization.

The life she wanted was having a lot of money without working at all. She wanted to go wherever she wanted to have fun. She honestly had no interest in running a company. Even the small business owned by her was managed by other people. She didn’t need to spend much effort on it.

The Tang Organization, however, was different. It was too large and its owner must be very careful not to make any mistakes, which was quite stressful once she thought about that.

Tang Bingsen stayed in a VIP ward, which wasn’t in the same building as other common wards. Gu Ning went to the VIP inpatient department building, but she didn’t rush to go inside. Instead, she used her Jade Eyes to see ward 505 on the fifth floor.

She wasn’t doing it to make sure whether Tang Bingsen was in it, instead she did it to see the situation in order to be prepared.

In Tang Bingsen’s ward, he was lying in the patient bed, while his secretary was sitting aside with a laptop. They were talking about business. It was very late, but Tang Bingsen was still busy dealing with his work, which showed his great desire to control his power.

Although the Tang Organization was owned by him and he had the absolute power to make all the decisions, the situation was different now. He was sick and it was also hard for him to deal with his work now.

Actually, he could leave his work to those who he trusted. There were some people who had Tang Bingsen’s trust, but he was simply unwilling to leave his work to other people.

Many people had different purposes in the Tang Organization, but they all relied on it to gain benefits, so the company’s future was their first priority. Anyway, Tang Bingsen still insisted on doing the work on his own.

In the living room in the ward, there were two mercenaries who stayed by Tang Bingsen’s side at all times in case “Tang Aining” suddenly showed up to attack him.

Although “Tang Aining” had been absent for days, Tang Bingsen couldn’t relax at all. Maybe “Tang Aining” was secretly spying on him. Once he was left alone, she would appear!

His secretary and security guards slept on the sofa in the living room, but basically only his secretary could have regular sleep. The security guards, however, couldn’t sleep often, because they were worried that “Tang Aining” might come once they closed their eyes.

Actually, they had never doubted their abilities before they encountered “Tang Aining”. Even if they were asleep, they were confident that they could sense any sounds and movements. Nevertheless, after knowing what had happened to their mates and how “Tang Aining” was able to intrude without anyone knowing, they didn’t dare to relax.

If they had to have some sleep, one of them had to stay awake while the other went to have a little sleep.

In fact, all the above weren’t problems in Gu Ning’s eyes. Even though there were other people in Tang Bingsen’s ward, no one could stop her from taking action.

Gu Ning withdrew her sight, and went upstairs.

This was the VIP inpatient department, but there weren’t strict rules about who could enter. It was only forbidden to tell the number of wards of the patients. If the patient’s relatives or friends wanted to visit him or her, they could directly give him or her a call for the number of the ward. Therefore, most visitors who didn’t know the number of wards were unkind.

Even if they were friendly visitors, the hospital would still choose to take the responsibility and keep it secret.

Anyway, Gu Ning went straight to the outside of Tang Bingsen’s ward without encountering any difficulties. Because it was very late, there weren’t many passersby.
