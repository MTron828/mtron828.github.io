Chapter 186 Let’s Go Dine Together

Gu Ning didn’t know what to say. Although she thought that it wasn’t necessary for him to do that, she was touched deeply. He arranged it all for her.

Gu Ning replied: How about the deal the man discussed with my uncle?

Leng Shaoting: He just happens to be building a factory in the suburb, but he would only discuss with your uncle if he is satisfied with the construction materials.

Which meant that the man wanted to cooperate with Jiang Xu because he was satisfied with the quality of the construction materials that Jiang Xu could supply. That made sense though. The construction materials that Jiang Xu had prepared were all of high quality. Most of the reliable buyers would choose Jiang Xu to be their provider.

Gu Ning replied: Thanks!

Actually, Leng Shaoting was sitting in his Land Rover not far from the Xuri Construction Material Store. He looked to the direction of the Xuri Construction Material Store. There was a faint smile on his lips. He was happy to see her being happy.

Gu Ning then told Jiang Xu, “Uncle, these are all from a friend of my friend. He knew that we are holding the opening ceremony today, so he got them to send you some gifts. Please note their names, we can send gifts back to them in the future.”

“Your friend? What kind of friend? How does he know so many rich people?” Gu Man asked. This was the first time she had asked Gu Ning about her friends, but it cost too much money this time, and all of them were astonished.

Gu Ning knew that she couldn’t give her mother a perfunctory answer, so she explained in this way, “He is the friend whose life I saved. We keep in touch now. Mom, you know network matters in business. He is an important figure, and he is willing to help me. I don’t think I should reject.”

Hearing that, Gu Man believed that it was alright.

Meanwhile, Qin Zixun took out a box handing it to Gu Ning. “Boss, my cousin Yifan is occupied today, so he asked me to give this gift to you.”

“What?” Gu Ning was surprised. She didn’t tell Qin Yifan so how did he know about it? Qin Zixun must have told him.

“Thanks,” Gu Ning took it, then gave it to Jiang Xu.

“Wow...” Jiang Xu opened it, and rounded his eyes in shock when he saw what was inside. Is this gold?

“This is a brave troops made completely of pure gold. The brave troops is a legendary animal and stood for good wishes in the ancient time. It could accumulate endless fortune into its stomach, but didn’t show it at all. It can also bring you good luck and help you run a profitable business,” Qin Zixun explained.

“What? Completely made of gold?”

Hearing that, everyone was more than shocked. It must be worth over a million yuan at least according to its size!

“It-it’s so expensive!” Jiang Xu’s hands were trembling a little. He didn’t dare to take it.

Gu Ning didn’t think that it was a big deal. She had sent Qin Yifan’s father an antique worth several million yuan last time. Qin Yifan did it this time to show his appreciation.

Gu Ning went to Jiang Xu’s side, comforting him in a quiet voice, “Uncle, please take it. I sent his father an expensive gift at his father’s birthday party. It’s fine for us to take his gift.”

Gu Ning said that just to allay Jiang Xu’s concern. Indeed, Jiang Xu relaxed a lot after Gu Ning’s comfort.

During a break, Gu Ning walked aside to call Qin Yifan.

Qin Yifan hesitated to answer it in the beginning, because he didn’t know what to say to Gu Ning, but he answered it in the end. “Hi.”

“Hi, thank you so much for the gift. I’m sorry, I didn’t tell you because I was afraid that you would feel uneasy,” Gu Ning thanked him before apologizing to him. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“It’s nothing. I am occupied today anyway,” Qin Yifan said airily. Of course, it was an excuse.

Gu Ning also understood, and she didn’t point it out. They soon hung up.

In the office, Qin Yifan let his mind wander, fixing his eyes on the phone. He felt sad in his heart, because he couldn’t forget Gu Ning.

In the afternoon, Jiang Xu guided his guests to a nearby five-star hotel to dine together. All the guests has sent him expensive gifts, he absolutely had to treat them well.

After the meal, it was still early. Gu Ning proposed, “Why don’t we go and visit Mixi’s mother? We haven’t visited her in so long.”

Gu Ning thought that it would be impolite because they hadn’t visited Mixi’s mother in a week.

“Oh, right! How could we forget?!” Everyone suddenly realized it afterwards.

“Is it convenient for you all?” Yu Mixi understood that her friends would never visit her mother with empty hands.

“It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.”

Then, they went to the hospital together. They bought a pile of nourishing products before they visited Mixi’s mother. Yu Mixi tried to stop them in vain.

Yu Mixi’s parents were both astonished when they appeared with bags and boxes of nourishing products. Yu Mixi’s mother recovered well, even her chronic disease was cured. She could now live like a normal person.

That was the effect of Gu Ning’s power.

Although Mixi’s mother was in good condition now, she had lain in bed for so long, and lacked exercise. She still needed to practice to be able to use her limbs well, but she could leave the hospital soon.

Yu Mixi’s mother thanked Gu Ning endlessly, and almost bent on her knees before Gu Ning after she found out that Gu Ning was the one who had lent the money to her family.

To let Yu Mixi’s mother have a good rest, Gu Ning and her friends left after 30 minutes. They didn’t want to bother Yu Mixi’s mother for too long. Yu Mixi wanted to walk them out, but Gu Ning declined.

Their homes were in different directions, so they separated at the gate of the hospital.

Gu Ning planned to run home. As long as she could run, she wouldn’t take a car, but before long, a familiar Land Rover stopped by her side. It was Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning didn’t get in right away, but squinted at Leng Shaoting. “Why are you here?”

Leng Shaoting was a little nervous. He didn’t dare to meet her eyes, and he knew he shouldn’t have followed Gu Ning, but he told her the truth. “I’ve been following you.”

“Why?” Gu Ning asked.

“No reason, I just wanted to follow you,” Leng Shaoting replied.

Gu Ning was touched. She wasn’t willing to push Leng Shaoting away from her, so she decided to forget it, and got in the car. “Have you eaten?”

“Not yet,” Leng Shaoting said. Gu Ning signed resignedly.

“What do you want to have? Let’s go dine together,” Gu Ning said.

“Great!” Leng Shaoting’s face lit up. He immediately drove the car ahead.
