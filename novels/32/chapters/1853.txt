Chapter 1854: The Military Training Is Over

“Perhaps other girls are jealous of me,” said Gu Ning in a narcissistic tone.

“You’re a narcissist.” Song Miaoge rolled her eyes at Gu Ning.

“Tell us, what exactly happened?” Baili Zongxue asked curiously.

“I have a grudge with Yuan Shuyan. And that girl tried to bully me to please Yuan Shuyan,” said Gu Ning. She didn’t mention Rong Zechen.

“I think that they won’t give up,” said Baili Zongxue. She could tell that they were unkind people by a simple glance. Besides, they deliberately caused Gu Ning trouble, it meant it could happen again.

If they were kind, they wouldn’t have purposely made things difficult for Gu Ning today.

“It’s fine. I’ll beat them if they dare to do it again,” said Gu Ning with calmly. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Right, if it happens again, Miaoge can seize the chance to practice her skills. If it’s serious, we can beat them together,” said Baili Zongxue.

“Why do I somehow feel that you don’t think I can handle it alone?” said Song Miaoge, feeling displeased.

“Ha-ha, you’re not dumb!” Gu Ning joked.

“How can you despise me?” Song Miaoge was annoyed and rushed to playfully fight with them.

Gu Ning seldom did that with her friends, because she was mentally approaching 30 after all. She was mature and stable most of the time.

At this time, a girl walked to them with a grin.

Gu Ning also gave her a smile. It was Leng Shaoxi.

Baili Zongxue didn’t know Leng Shaoxi, but Song Miaoge did. However, she wasn’t familiar with her.

Seeing Leng Shaoxi, Song Miaoge felt a little nervous. She wasn’t afraid of Leng Shaoxi, but was nervous because there was a huge gap between their family background. The Song family was the subordinate of the Leng family as well, so she subconsciously thought that she was inferior to Leng Shaoxi.

“Hi, Senior Leng!” Song Miaoge greeted her at once.

“Nice to see you all!” Leng Shaoxi gently greeted them without any arrogance. After that, she turned to Gu Ning. “I heard of another of your achievements.”

Hearing Leng Shaoxi talking to Gu Ning, Song Miaoge was greatly surprised because it was obvious that they knew each other.

Although Leng Shaoxi knew many people, only a few looked so close to her.

Moreover, she wondered whether Gu Ning was aware of Leng Shaoxi’s family background or not.

Although she was curious, she knew she shouldn’t ask about that right now.

“Well, haters are everywhere,” said Gu Ning.

“Right, you’re too outstanding so many people are jealous of you.” Leng Shaoxi agreed, because it was the truth.

“Alright, why don’t we dine together? My treat,” said Leng Shaoxi.

“Sure!” Gu Ning didn’t decline, or Leng Shaoxi would use Master Leng’s influence to put pressure on her.

After that, they went to the canteen together.

“Oh, let me introduce you. This is Song Miaoge. I bet you know her. This is also our friend, Baili Zongxue.” Gu Ning introduced her friends to Leng Shaoxi, then she turned to Baili Zongxue. “Zongxue, this is my friend and she’s also senior to us, Leng Shaoxi.”

She didn’t tell them her real relationship with Leng Shaoxi. And because of Leng Shaoxi’s presence, Song Miaoge didn’t ask Gu Ning why she knew Leng Shaoxi.

They went to the high-end canteen and ordered four dishes with a soup.

After having the meal, Leng Shaoxi left alone to go to her dorm room to do some cleaning. She just came to the school this morning so her dorm room needed cleaning. She hadn’t organized her stuff yet before she came to see Gu Ning when it was time for lunch.

Gu Ning and her friends went to the small woods for training as usual.

Once Leng Shaoxi was gone, Song Miaoge asked Gu Ning, “Gu Ning, I’m surprised that you know Senior Leng! How did you get to know each other?”

“She’s the friend of a friend of mine,” said Gu Ning.

“Oh!” Song Miaoge stopped asking.

In the afternoon, Yuan Shuyan heard the news that Leng Shaoxi shared lunch with Gu Ning today, which surprised her as well. To her astonishment, Gu Ning knew Leng Shaoxi.

Anyway, Gu Ning probably didn’t know Leng Shaoxi, maybe one of her friends did, because Gu Ning wasn’t alone with Leng Shaoxi at that time.

Even if Gu Ning knew Leng Shaoxi, Yuan Shuyan didn’t think that Leng Shaoxi would help Gu Ning if Gu Ning encountered trouble.

Leng Shaoxi might be willing to help, but the Leng family wouldn’t agree.

The Leng family wasn’t dumb and wouldn’t bother to help an outsider. Besides, she was a member of the Yuan family.

Normally, a powerful family was reluctant to have a grudge against another power family of the same level just for an outsider, because it was unnecessary trouble.

If it was for their own family, it would be different. Whether for their face or reputation, it would protect its own family members to the end.

Yuan Shuyan didn’t know Gu Ning’s relationship with the Leng family, otherwise she wouldn’t dare to mess with her.

However, precisely because Yuan Shuyan didn’t know that, she didn’t think it was a big deal that Gu Ning knew Leng Shaoxi. They only knew each other, which meant nothing. Therefore, she was determined to pay Gu Ning back.

To be honest, even if the dirty secret was exposed, it had nothing to do with her. She didn’t hire the bunch of hoodlums after all.

It was quite obvious that Yuan Shuyan only cared to make use of her friends.

...

After a few days, the military training was over.

At the beginning, everyone complained about it, but they somehow felt reluctant to see it end right now.

They experienced the precious relationship among comrades. When comrades of years left each other, they cried. They had only been trained for half a month, but most of the students quietly cried as the instructors left them.

On the day the military training was over, they had a training exhibition in the morning and they were free in the afternoon. After the class meeting the next morning, they would begin to have classes.

Because the military training was finally over, Song Miaoge wanted to relax. She invited Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue to dine outside at noon. They could hang out for a while before coming back for the training.

They planned to not go far, so they left on foot.

Along the way, they heard many people talking about Kouzi sunscreen. The majority of the students who had used Kouzi sunscreen didn’t get tanned after the military training of half a month.

However, some students hadn’t used Kouzi sunscreen. They simply didn’t know about it or didn’t care about that, so they were tanned to different extents.

Boys didn’t care much about the color of their skin, so few of them used sunscreen. As a result, the most tanned students were boys.

After the big news about Kouzi sunscreen, Kouzi became more and more popular, especially its sunscreen which was always out of stock.

Its other products also had extremely high sales.
