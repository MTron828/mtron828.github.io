Chapter 534 Zhang Shunlin’s Revenge

Gu Ning thought that it wasn’t that simple, but before she got to know more details, she couldn’t jump to conclusions. Since Gu Qinyang was in trouble, she had to help him out.

“Don’t worry. Shaoting and I will bring Uncle Qinyang back,” Gu Ning said to comfort them.

“But...” Gu Man was worried about Gu Ning’s safety.

“We’ll be fine,” Gu Ning said. “I know many important figures in the Qing Gang, and they won’t hurt Uncle Qinyang for my sake.”

Hearing that, Gu Man suddenly realized that several members of the Qing Gang had attended the opening ceremony of Jade Beauty Jewelry before, and they had even sent Gu Ning a gift which was worth over dozens of millions of yuan. Therefore, they chose to believe Gu Ning.

At the same time, they were also worried that the Qing Gang would hurt Gu Ning for money. It wasn’t a bad thing to maintain a relationship with the Qing Gang but it could be harmful too.

Nevertheless, Gu Ning was their only hope now, so they could only hope that Gu Ning would be fine.

When Leng Shaoting heard Gu Ning say that she knew some important figures in the Qing Gang, he became a jealous lover. As long as Situ Ye was involved he would be displeased, but he didn’t show it on his face.

“Shaoting, please keep an eye on Ningning,” Gu Man said to Leng Shaoting when they walked out of the kitchen.

Gu Man thought that Leng Shaoting had to be strong enough to protect a girl, since he was a military officer.

“Don’t worry. I will!” Leng Shaoting said seriously like it was a promise.

Indeed, it was his promise. As long as he was by Gu Ning’s side, he wouldn’t allow anyone to hurt her.

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning then left for Dihao Clubhouse.

Dihao Clubhouse was a 24-hour clubhouse, and it would only close on New Year’s Eve.

Once they entered Dihao Clubhouse, Gu Ning told the reception, “I’m here for Long Ge. Tell him Gu Qinyang’s family is here.”

The reception called Long Ge at once, and Gu Ning along with Leng Shaoting went to the No. 7 private room on the sixth floor according to Long Ge’s order.

In the No.7 private room, Gu Qinyang hadn’t been beaten or tied, but sat on the chair quietly.

On the sofa across from Gu Qinyang, a man in his early thirties was smoking with his legs crossed.

This man was precisely Long Ge, who was a middle manager of Dihao Clubhouse.

Behind Long Ge, there were four strong men who followed Long Ge’s lead, and Gu Qinyang was obviously scared of them.

He, of course, couldn’t afford two million yuan and Gu Ning was his only hope now. However, he planned to pay her back in the future.

After hanging up, Long Ge looked at Gu Qinyang and sneered. “Your family is here. If they come with enough money, you’ll be lucky today.”

However, he didn’t believe that Gu Qinyang’s family could afford that much money.

Hearing that, Gu Qinyang was relieved.

Before long, someone knocked on the door of the private room. A young girl, followed by a man, walked in later.

Long Ge was a little confused, because he had called Gu Qinyang’s wife. Are they Gu Qinyang’s daughter and son? He thought to himself.

“We’re Gu Qinyang’s family and we’re here to take him home,” Gu Ning said.

The door closed behind them.

“Ningning!” Seeing Gu Ning, Gu Qinyang almost cried in excitement. As long as Gu Ning was here, he would be safe.

Long Ge was struck dumb for a second when he saw Gu Ning’s face clearly, then he jumped up from the sofa in shock. “Are-are you Miss

Gu?”

Gu Ning was a little surprised that the man recognized her, but she soon realized that it had to have been Situ Ye who told some important members in the Qing Gang to remember her face in order to protect her.

“Yes, I am,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Long Ge felt embarrassed. If Gu Qinyang was Gu Ning’s family, he would be punished by Situ Ye for annoying Gu Ning.

“I’m sorry, Miss Gu, I had no idea that Gu Qinyang is your family. Um, since you’re here to take him home, you may leave right now.” Long Ge panicked a little. He was worried that Gu Ning would be mad at him.

Seeing Long Ge’s attitude towards Gu Ning, Gu Qinyang was totally shocked, but he soon remembered that several members of the Qing Gang had attended the opening ceremony of Jade Beauty Jewelry before. Nevertheless, he was still impressed by Gu Ning’s network. It seemed that Gu Ning was really influential! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Although Long Ge was being very polite, Gu Ning ignored his apologies.

“Well, I heard that my uncle broke an antique vase which is worth two million yuan,” Gu Ning said. “Can we go to the antique association to have it verified before we pay the money?”

Hearing that, Long Ge understood that Gu Ning wouldn’t leave until she found out the truth. Therefore, he told her everything. After all, Gu Ning was his boss’s friend, and he didn’t dare annoy her.

“Miss Gu, in fact, the antique vase Mr. Gu broke was fake,” Long Ge said carefully, in case Gu Ning would be mad at him.

However, Gu Ning remained calm as usual. Obviously, it wasn’t a surprising answer. From Gu Ning’s face, Long Ge immediately knew that this young girl wasn’t simple.

“What? It’s fake?” Gu Qinyang, on the other hand, almost shouted out. He couldn’t understand why they did that to him.

After that, Long Ge told them the details.

It was Zhang Shunlin who had schemed against Gu Qinyang. Zhang Shunlin happened to know some people who were Gu Qinyang’s friends, so he gave them money to let them help him call Gu Qinyang out and trap Gu Qinyang

Zhang Shunlin and Long Ge came from the same city, but they weren’t actually close. Long Ge merely helped him for money.
