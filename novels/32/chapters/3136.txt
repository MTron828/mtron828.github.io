3138 She’s Leng Xiaoyao?

Besides, Jiang Yihan understood that Leng Xiaoyao must be beautiful after dressing up. And there was only one girl that she didn’t know who was wearing a black gown.

After observing for a while, she saw Leng Xiaoyao’s features in the girl, so she believed the girl was highly likely to be Leng Xiaoyao.

However, she wasn’t sure, so she asked Leng Yuqi, “Yuqi, is the girl in a black gown who is standing with An Chenmeng and Xiong Manxin Leng Xiaoyao?”

Although Jiang Yihan wasn’t very sure, she believed she was right. As a result, she was unhappy.

If she were Leng Xiaoyao, would Chu Jianan be attracted to her?

She understood that Leng Xiaoyao had to be beautiful after dressing up, but she was still surprised by Leng Xiaoyao’s beauty.

“Where? Where is Leng Xiaoyao?” Chu Jiayu turned to look for Leng Xiaoyao as well.

Before long, she saw An Chenmeng, Xiong Manxin and the others, then her sight fell on the girl in a black gown which Jiang Yihan talked about.

There was only five meters between them, so they could see the girl clearly.

The next moment, they were amazed.

The girl was Leng Xiaoyao? Chu Jiayu couldn’t believe that the elegant and stunning girl could be Leng Xiaoyao.

“Yes,” Leng Yuqi admitted.

After making sure it was Leng Xiaoyao, Jiang Yihan felt a serious sense of crisis. She acted calm and turned to look at Chu Jianan, but Chu Jianan wasn’t staring at Leng Xiaoyao at the moment, so she didn’t know how he felt.

Chu Jiayu was shocked. To her astonishment, the girl was Leng Xiaoyao. She was gorgeous!

At that moment, Chu Jiayu was also curious about her older brother’s thoughts after seeing such a beautiful Leng Xiaoyao. Would he regret ending their engagement? If he did, would he chase Leng Xiaoyao again?

If he did, then Leng Yuqi…

Chu Jiayu turned to look at Leng Yuqi worriedly. She saw that Leng Yuqi was displeased, so she knew Leng Yuqi was thinking about the same thing. Therefore, she comforted Leng Yuqi. “It’s true that Leng Xiaoyao is pretty after dressing up, but she’s still not comparable to Yuqi.”

She was obviously lying, because Leng Xiaoyao looked much prettier than Leng Yuqi today, but she deliberately said that to comfort Leng Yuqi.

Leng Yuqi didn’t feel better at all. Instead, she was even sadder. Because she knew that Leng Xiaoyao was more attractive than her, she felt Chu Jiayu was mocking her by saying that.

Jiang Yihan understood that Chu Jiayu simply wanted Leng Yuqi to feel better, but it wasn’t true, so it sounded sarcastic. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Even she felt it wasn’t comforting, because Leng Yuqi could barely compare to Leng Xiaoyao.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t feel more threatened by Leng Xiaoyao instead of Leng Yuqi.

After all, she had already stolen Chu Jianan away from Leng Yuqi, but she didn’t know whether Chu Jianan would be attracted to Leng Xiaoyao.

“Um, Yuqi, did Jianan already know that Leng Xiaoyao is so pretty after dressing up early on?” Jiang Yihan asked Leng Yuqi. She pretended to care about Leng Yuqi, but she was actually trying to find out more.

In the past, she wanted Leng Xiaoyao to be better than Leng Yuqi, so that Leng Yuqi would be hurt, but after sleeping with Chu Jianan, she was afraid that Leng Xiaoyao would really be better than Leng Yuqi and would attract Chu Jianan’s attention.

If so, she would be in danger.

It was hard for her to get in a relationship with Chu Jianan, so she wouldn’t allow anyone to ruin it.

“He knew early on,” Leng Yuqi said. Because it was the truth, she didn’t bother to keep it a secret.

“What? My brother knew already? What was his reaction?” Chu Jiayu asked curiously.

“He told me he was only surprised, but because Leng Xiaoyao humiliates him every time they meet, he hates her,” Leng Yuqi said. Although she was also worried that Chu Jianan might regret breaking up with Leng Xiaoyao, she cared a lot about her face, so she told her friends that Chu Jianan hated Leng Xiaoyao.

Jiang Yihan and Chu Jiayu didn’t doubt Leng Xiaoyao’s words. They were both aware that Chu Jianan had a high self-esteem. He would obviously hate Leng Xiaoyao after being humiliated by her.

If that happened to them, they would have the same feelings.

Therefore, Jiang Yihan was slightly relieved.

“Leng Xiaoyao is a bi*ch! Since their engagement has already ended, why would she still humiliate my brother? Is she trying to attract my brother’s attention?” Chu Jiayu swore.

Leng Yuqi and Jiang Yihan were sensitive, so they were scared when Chu Jiayu said that. Was Leng Xiaoyao really trying to attract Chu Jianan’s attention by humiliating him?

Chu Jiayu continued. “But my brother will only hate Leng Xiaoyao more if she humiliates him again and again.”

In that case, Jiang Yihan and Leng Yuqi hoped that Leng Xiaoyao could humiliate Chu Jianan whenever they met, because Chu Jianan would only hate her more and more.

No matter how outstanding Leng Xiaoyao was, they didn’t want Chu Jianan to have any interest in her.

They were all worried that Chu Jianan might be attracted to Leng Xiaoyao again, and didn’t bother thinking about Leng Xiaoyao’s opinion towards Chu Jianan.

That must be true love. If a girl loved a man truly, she would be jealous even though her boyfriend was as ugly as a pig.

Leng Yuqi and Jiang Yihan indeed felt Chu Jianan was the best, but in Leng Xiaoyao’s eyes, Chu Jianan was an awful person.

“Right, the more Leng Xiaoyao humiliates Jianan, the more Jianan will hate her,” Jiang Yihan said to comfort Leng Yuqi and herself.

Leng Yuqi finally felt better.

Leng Xiaoyao sensed that Chu Jianan, Leng Yuqi, and the others were watching her, but she didn’t pay attention to them. She only gave them a glance when they looked at her maliciously.

She felt nothing when Chu Jianan showed up. As long as he stayed away from her, she wouldn’t cause him trouble publicly, but if he made things difficult for her, she wouldn’t hesitate to teach him a lesson.
