Chapter 2508: It’s Not a Bad Thing

If they lost connection with the airport control tower, they would have no idea about the direction they were going in, and after the private jet ran out of fuel, they would directly crash.

Their private jet took off at 10:20 pm, so after five hours, it landed at the airport of the capital at 3:30 am.

Before they came back, Leng Shaoting told Jing Yunyao and Stone their arrival time, so they were already waiting for them when they arrived.

Because Leng Shaoting and the others came out of the exclusive passage, Jing Yunyao and Stone waited for them there.

When they came out, Shangguan Yang, Jiang Liluo, and Si Jin shared the car with Stone, while Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning sat in Jing Yunyao’s car, but Leng Shaoting was the driver.

Leng Shaoting was a grown man, so he told Jing Yunyao and Gu Ning to be the passengers and said that he would be the driver.

“Was it dangerous when you broke into the next level?” asked Jing Yunyao. Although Leng Shaoting was safe and sound in front of her right now and had already survived no matter how dangerous the situation was, as a mother, she still wanted to know more.

“Not really. Everything went well,” said Leng Shaoting. It was true that he smoothly broke into the next level. After all, there was no heavenly thunder.

“Great!” Jing Yunyao was relieved.

“Oh, what happened during the past few days?” asked Leng Shaoting. Although the problem was solved, he felt it was necessary for him to know everything.

“The third day after you left, Jinchen called me. He said that an archeology team discovered zombies in City Nan, so I immediately went there with him. After we solved the problem, the Yuan family heard that an outsider joined the Red Flame in the task. They sent Du Zhenghan and two senior officers to report it to the president. The president called you first, but your phone was turned off. So he called Jinchen, who asked me how to handle it. Since the Yuan family reported it to the president, I had to show up. So I talked about it with your grandfather and we

went to see the president together. It didn’t get serious, and there was no reason for them to continue to make things difficult for us. But I’m afraid I can’t keep my real identity a secret any longer,” said Jing Yunyao, but she didn’t really care about that.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was mad, but it had already happened, so he could only accept the result. It was meaningless for him to think about it, but the Yuan family was really hateful. He thought that he should teach them a lesson.

Leng Shaoting saw the missed calls from Wei Lingfeng, but he hadn’t called him back. Now after hearing Jing Yunyao’s reply, Leng Shaoting realized why Wei Lingfeng called him.

He decided to call Wei Lingfeng back later.

“Did the news about the zombies spread?” Gu Ning asked. She cared more about that. If the news spread abroad, it could cause serious trouble.

“No, only a few people are aware of that. We didn’t let the news spread,” said Jing Yunyao.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were relieved.

“Oh, the president wanted to place me back in the same position in the military, but I declined. I don’t want to be busy with work now, but I promised to help the government if anything special happens again,” said Jing Yunyao.

“Whether we agree to help or not, we have to deal with it if such a thing happens, so it’s not a bad thing that we are doing the president a big favor. We can also put pressure on other major families by doing so,” said Leng Shaoting.

Whether they promised Wei Lingfeng to help the government or not, Jing Yunyao and Leng Shaoting would stand against monsters and ghosts. Therefore, since they agreed to help the government, they were doing Wei Lingfeng a big favor. That was they could also stop other major families from making things difficult for Jing Yunyao.

If Jing Yunyao didn’t help, no one would dare to deal with those monsters and ghosts. As a

result, other major families were happy to know that Jing Yunyao was willing to handle the problem. Therefore they would stop deliberately picking on her.

However, it didn’t mean that they no longer saw Jing Yunyao as an enemy. If there was a chance, they would still make things difficult for her.

Because of Jing Yunyao, the Leng family became more influential and it was a big threat to them. Accordingly, they could only surpass the Leng family by removing its helpers. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

‘Your grandfather nearly had an argument with the president, so I told your grandfather that we’re all cultivators in order to set his mind at ease. Otherwise, he’d be worried about our safety when we deal with monsters and ghosts,” said Jing Yunyao.

“Alright, at least he’ll be less worried,” said Leng Shaoting. If it was possible, he wished that Master Leng could have been unaware of it, but it was better for him to know in the current situation.

Jing Yunyao didn’t tell him that she ran into members of the Jing family, because she thought it was unimportant. In addition, she didn’t know that the Jing family was searching for her after the meeting.

Right now, Leng Shaoting had become a senior cultivator at the primary stage of the Yuan Ying Period, so there was no need for them to be afraid even if the Jing family found her.

By the time they were back in the siheyuan, it was nearly 4:30 am and the sky was almost bright.

However, they still needed to sleep for a while, so they washed up and went to bed without delay.

Because they went to sleep late, they didn’t get up till 7 am the next day.

It wasn’t late for ordinary people, but for Gu Ning and the other early birds, it was late.

Anyway, they had nothing to deal with in the morning, so it didn’t matter that they got up late.

After they got up, Leng Shaoting called Master Leng first and said that he was back home safely.

During these days, Master Leng was always worried about Leng Shaoting, even though he believed that Leng Shaoting would be fine. So after receiving Leng Shaoting’s call, Master Leng was relieved.

He had gradually accepted the fact that Jing Yunyao, Leng Shaoting, and Gu Ning were all cultivators.

Actually, he was left with no choice. He had to accept it, since he would only make himself sad if he thought about it too much.

Master Leng reminded Leng Shaoting to be careful. No matter what danger he encountered, he should protect himself first.

Leng Shaoting agreed.

After speaking with Master Leng, Leng Shaoting called Wei Lingfeng back..
