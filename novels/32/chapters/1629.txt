Chapter 1632: An Adopted Son

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Huang Haihao was shocked as he looked at Gu Ning.

It seemed that “Tang Aining” wasn’t an evil person. He couldn’t help but admire her more. Although he wasn’t a good man, it didn’t mean that he enjoyed doing bad deeds. In fact, most of the time, he was forced to do what he had to do. He hadn’t hurt innocent people before, but he wasn’t sure whether his subordinates had done that.

So since he didn’t need to do bad things in the future, he felt relieved. He didn’t feel good when he did bad things. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Sure, I understand,” said Huang Haihao. He was willing to be loyal to “Tang Aining”.

“Oh, I usually stay in the capital, so you’ll be in complete control of the Tianying Gang here, but I’ll come once I’m free. Even if I don’t come in person, I’ll send someone. I want to trust you, but it takes time for us to trust each other,” said Gu Ning.

This was their first meeting, so it was impossible for Gu Ning to fully trust him. Therefore, both of them needed time.

Huang Haihao wasn’t dumb, and it wasn’t likely that he would betray Gu Ning, but Gu Ning still needed to be careful.

“Of course,” said Huang Haihao. He understood why “Tang Aining” said that. Since he was willing to follow her lead, he wouldn’t betray her and he also needed her protection.

“Oh, whose name are the Tianying Gang’s businesses under?” asked Gu Ning. She knew the Tianying Gang’s businesses couldn’t be under Tang Bingsen’s name, because it would expose their relationship.

She was right.

“The Tianying Gang’s businesses are under my name, because Tang Bingsen doesn’t want to have any connection with the Tianying Gang,” said Huang Haihao.

The Tianying Gang used to be a small gang, and the leader was Huang Haihao from the very beginning, but it didn’t start to make a lot of money until Tang Bingsen became its real boss. Therefore, the Tianying Gang relied on Tang Bingsen’s money to develop at the beginning.

Tang Bingsen registered the Tianying Gang’s businesses under Huang Haihao’s name not because he fully trusted Huang Haihao, but because he was left no choice. He needed Huang Haihao to help him manage the Tianying Gang.

Actually, it took a long time for Tang Bingsen to fully trust Huang Haihao. However, their close relationship ended now.

“Since the Tianying Gang’s businesses are under your name, what would he do if anything terrible happens to you? He’s even unwilling to pay five billion yuan to free you,” said Gu Ning.

“I have an adopted son under my name too, and I already made the will. If anything terrible happened to me, the Tianying Gang’s businesses will be his. The son is actually Tang Bingsen’s illegitimate son, so he can get his property back in that way. It’s also the reason why he doesn’t care about my safety,” said Huang Haihao. “Oh, we must give 50% profits to him every year, and the other 50% will be divided among the senior managers.”

“His illegitimate son? Do you mean Feng Qile?” asked Gu Ning.

“Yes, it is Feng Qile,” said Huang Haihao. He wasn’t surprised that “Tang Aining” knew about Feng Qile.

“Well, I think you should change your will as soon as possible,” said Gu Ning.

“Sure.” Huang Haihao nodded. Since Tang Bingsen didn’t care about his safety at all, he didn’t want to help him any longer.

“No matter what will happen to Tang Bingsen in the future, the Tianying Gang shouldn’t be involved. Don’t tell other people that the Tianying Gang isn’t under Tang Bingsen’s control from now on. I need some time to deal with Tang Bingsen,” said Gu Ning.

“I understand,” said Huang Haihao. “By the way, how should I address you?”

“Call me Miss Tang,” said Gu Ning.

“Sure, Miss Tang,” said Huang Haihao.
