3318 Is It a Robbery?

“Mochen, I know you have grievances against the Li family, but no matter what, you are still a member of the family. The past is in the past, and I hope you can let go of your grudges. Your grandfather is getting old and wants the family to be harmonious. Please come back to the Li family,” Li Mingke said. Although he felt guilty saying it, his good mental state prevented him from showing it. Instead he had a sincere expression.

Ordinary people might have been moved by his words, but Li Mochen could clearly see him through!

“Is this his idea or yours?” Li Mochen asked calmly, showing no emotions.

“Your grandfather’s idea.” Li Mingke replied.

“If this was your idea, I might believe that you genuinely see me as a member of the Li family, but if anyone else suggests this, I won’t believe it for a second. It’s just that the Li family is in trouble and can’t resist. They heard that I have good connections, so they want me to come back to the Li family and want to use my connections to strengthen the Li family. I’m not stupid. I know what’s going on,” Li Mochen said mockingly.

Li Mingke was disappointed. He avoided Li Mochen’s eyes because what Li Mochen said was true.

“You should go! I won’t interfere with the Li family’s affairs. If anything happens to the Li family in the future, as long as you don’t scheme against me, I will protect your family, but if you and Master Li and Li Mingde’s family are the same, I won’t care about you either,” Li Mochen said and left without saying more.

Li Mochen’s attitude was resolute, so Li Mingke couldn’t say anything more because he didn’t want to offend Li Mochen.

After all, Li Mochen was the one who was hurt, so they had no right to advise him to be forgiving.

After returning to the car, Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao went back to Hanlin Manor without discussing his conversation with Li Mingke.

When they arrived at Hanlin Manor, they went straight to their houses to rest since they had both drunk a bit.

…

Li Mingke went back to the Li family’s mansion and reported Li Mochen’s reply to Li Zongquan, but he only mentioned that Li Mochen knew about their intentions and didn’t want to come back. He didn’t reveal anything he shouldn’t say.

Li Zongquan was so angry that he smashed his teacup on the ground. He couldn’t believe that Li Mochen refused to come back and thought that Li Mochen was ungrateful. “He’s an ingrate. It’s an honor for him to be needed by us!” he said.

If Li Mochen was an ingrate, why did they bother to ask him to come back? Li Mingke murmured to himself, but he didn’t dare say it out loud.

Li Zongquan was a selfish and arrogant person. Despite being seventy years old, he still coveted power. However, in recent years, the Li family had been declining, with each generation holding lower positions than the previous one.

To put it bluntly, the Li family was now at the bottom of the first-class powerful families’ rankings. Even the second-class powerful families dared to provoke them. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Nevertheless, a starving camel was still bigger than a horse. Moreover, the Li family was only a bit weaker and not dead yet! So it wasn’t easy for a second-class powerful family to compete with them.

However, their strength was far behind that of a first-class powerful family. That was the reason why Li Zongquan was so desperate to ask Li Mochen to come back. Honestly, he disliked Li Mochen very much, but he didn’t want the Li family to decline while he was still alive.

If that happened, he would become a joke and he couldn’t bear to lose face.

After sending Li Mingke out, Li Zongquan once again ordered people to find Li Mochen. He sent a butler to see him directly this time.

The Li family’s high status and power made it easy to check the surveillance footage, so they quickly found out that Li Mochen had entered Hanlin Manor.

However, they could only investigate up to the entrance of Hanlin Manor. The surveillance cameras inside the manor were beyond their reach, even for the Li family’s butler.

As a result, the butler could only wait outside Hanlin Manor.

By now it was late at night, so there was no need for him to go there at this time. He would go early the next morning.

The next morning, Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao still got up early for their morning run.

Leng Xiaoyao suddenly remembered that it had been more than a month since Li Mochen’s chaotic power had last erupted. “Has your chaotic power erupted since the last time?”

“Yeah! It erupted a few days ago, but it wasn’t as painful as before because I found a way to control it.” replied Li Mochen.

“Ah, what a pity,” said Leng Xiaoyao, feeling a little sorry for him.

Due to the absorption of chaotic power, utilizing chaotic energy to enhance his cultivation was most effective when the chaotic power was erupting and continuously releasing energy. In that way, a significant amount of energy could be absorbed.

However, during normal times, the chaotic power was suppressed and couldn’t exert too much power, so the amount that could be absorbed naturally was limited.

Maybe absorbing it once could allow him to enter the foundation establishment stage!

“Hmm, what’s a pity?” For a moment, Li Mochen didn’t understand Leng Xiaoyao’s meaning.

“I couldn’t save the hero!” Leng Xiaoyao joked.

“If you come to the capital city after the National College Entrance Examination, or if I have time to go to City Chang later, then you will have a chance to save the hero,” Li Mochen said seriously, leaving Leng Xiaoyao shocked.

Although Li Mochen didn’t understand at first, he soon realized that Leng Xiaoyao was referring to the absorption of chaotic power. However, he didn’t get angry that Leng Xiaoyao said it was a pity.

Leng Xiaoyao and Wu Wenshi had an appointment at 9 am. So after their morning jog, eating breakfast, and resting until 8:30 am, they set off.

However, they were blocked right after leaving Hanlin Manor.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t know who the people who blocked them were, but Li Mochen did. It was the Li family’s butler, and he brought three people with decent skills. Did they really plan to take him head-on?

“Wait for me in the car.” Li Mochen didn’t want to drag Leng Xiaoyao into trouble, so he didn’t let her come out.

“Okay.” Li Mochen could handle it by himself, so Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to meddle in his affairs.

“Young Master Mochen.” Seeing Li Mochen get out of the car, the Li family’s butler politely greeted him, but his politeness was just superficial.

“Is the Li family so desperate that they have to rob people on the road? When did the Li family fall so low?” Li Mochen mocked.
