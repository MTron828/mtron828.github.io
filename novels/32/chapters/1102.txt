Chapter 1104 What Do You Mean?

Hearing that, Gu Ning felt that it was ridiculous.Tang Yaxin didn’t grow up with Tang Aining. Ever since Tang Yaxin moved into the Tang family’s house, she had lived the life of a noble lady and had seldom seen Tang Aining.

As for Tang Aining’s father, he was a shameless man!

“Well, you’re right,” Gu Ning said, but she had no intention to give the USB flash disk to them. “Can I visit Aining? I know that she has some scars on her body. Once I make sure the woman is her, I’ll give you the USB flash disk.”

Both Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin got nervous after knowing that. They had no idea that Tang Aining had scars on her body.

Although Qi Ziyue was Tang Aining’s ex boyfriend, they had never slept with each other, so he didn’t know she had scars on her body. And although Tang Yaxin was Tang Aining’s half-sister, they were bitter enemies. It was impossible for Tang Yaxin to know where Tang Aining had scars.

They thought that they could easily deceive this ‘Tang Aining’ with a smart lie, but this ‘Tang Aining’ turned out to be smarter than they thought.

“Don’t be so unreasonable.” Although Tang Yaxin felt guilty, she was angrier, because this ‘Tang Aining’ said it on purpose.

Gu Ning indeed said it on purpose, but Tang Yaxin was in no position to criticize her.

“Yaxin.” Qi Ziyue stopped Tang Yaxin at once. If Tang Yaxin couldn’t control her temper, it would ruin their plan.

Gu Ning, however, didn’t let Tang Yaxin go, but continued to question her. “I’m unreasonable? Miss Tang, why do you say that? I simply want to visit Aining. How come it’s unreasonable?”

“Miss Tang, please don’t misunderstand Yaxin. She didn’t mean that,” Qi Ziyue explained at once, but Gu Ning interrupted him, “She didn’t mean that? What exactly does she mean then?”

“You...” Tang Yaxin was furious, but didn’t know how to argue back, and Qi Ziyue didn’t give her the chance to keep on arguing with Gu Ning either. He said, “Well, Miss Tang, if you want to visit Aining, we can find a time to do that.”

He couldn’t bring Gu Ning to visit Tang Aining right now, because his dirty trick would be exposed if they did that now. Therefore, he planned to give an excuse that Tang Aining disappeared all of a sudden again. As for the USB flash disk, they had to figure out another way.

“Fine, I should leave now. Call me whenever it’s possible, Mr. Qi,” Gu Ning said at the end.

“Sure, see you, Miss Tang,” Qi Ziyue said, and Gu Ning left.

“Ziyue, why did you let her go like that?” Tang Yaxin was still mad.

“She’s really annoying. Do you need us to help you teach her a lesson?” Shouta Minamino asked.

“Thanks, Mr. Minamino. I can handle it myself,” Qi Ziyue said.

“Great.” Shouta Minamino didn’t insist.

Qi Ziyue thought that he could use bait and ask this ‘Tang Aining’ to visit the injured Tang Aining, then seized the chance to force her to give him the USB flash disk.

Thinking of that, Qi Ziyue felt much better, but Tang Yaxin was still in a bad mood.

...

When Gu Ning was back in the city, it was already past 12 pm. She dined outside, then went back to the house and removed her make-up.

After resting for a while, she called Zi Beiying and invited Zi Beiying to have a tour of her business corporation.

Hearing that, Zi Beiying got excited and agreed with alacrity. She was always curious to know how many companies Gu Ning had.

Afterwards, Gu Ning told Zi Beiying to pick her up at Leng Shaoting’s house, because Zi Beiying had Leng Shaoting’s other car.

About 20 minutes later, Zi Beiying and her two bodyguards arrived. “Where is Shaoting?” she asked Gu Ning.

“He left to deal with something,” Gu Ning said.

Zi Beiying nodded, and didn’t ask further.

Gu Ning got in the car and told Mengda the address before they left.

Mengda wasn’t familiar with the roads in the capital, but it didn’t cause much trouble with the help of onboard navigation.

Zi Beiying ached to know more about Gu Ning’s business empire, but she didn’t ask many questions about it in the car because she would soon see it.

“Gu Ning, do you know any specialties in the capital?” Zi Beiying asked. She was very interested in delicious food, and would try the local specialties wherever she went.

“Um, I’m not clear about that, but Xu Jinchen’s younger sister should know very well. If you don’t mind, we can hang out with her later,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure!” Zi Beiying agreed without delay. She didn’t care that a stranger would join them, because she was very easy-going and the girl was Xu Jinchen’s younger sister too.

That being the case, Gu Ning called Xu Qinyin.

...

Xu Qinyin wasn’t up yet at this time. She was mad when the ringtone disturbed her. When she was about to directly reject it, she noticed the caller’s name and answered it without hesitation. “Hi, Gu Ning!”

“Qinyin, are you free today?” Gu Ning asked.

“Yeah, I’m always free. What’s up?” Xu Qinyin joked.

“Why don’t you hang out with me? I have a friend who wants to try the specialties in the capital. Can you be our guide?” Gu Ning asked.

“Well, if you didn’t need a guide, would you call me?” Xu Qinyin pretended to be annoyed.

“Of course I would!” Gu Ning laughed. “We’re friends, right?”
