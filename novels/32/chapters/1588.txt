Chapter 1590: Do as the Locals Do

Although Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting knew that senior cultivators could fly with a sword, they had never seen it before.

However, Gu Ning didn’t think it was a good idea. “Grandpa Shangguan, it’s a new world now, and we can’t move by swords now. It will scare other people.”

“What?” Shangguan Yang was shocked.

“Yeah, we can only fly with your sword for a short distance when there is no one else around,” Gu Ning said.

“No problem,” Shangguan Yang said.

It was easy for him to control his sword, and flying with the sword could save them a lot of time on the road.

After that, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting stepped on Shangguan Yang’s sword. Shangguan Yang stood at the front, followed by Leng Shaoting, and Gu Ning stood behind them.

Because Shangguan Yang was a man, Gu Ning would feel embarrassed if she had to hold his shoulders. Gu Ning was a girl with traditional ideas of gender differences, so she preferred to hold Leng Shaoting’s shoulders.

Besides, Shangguan Yang was much taller than her, so she would have to hold his waist if she wanted to stand steadily, which wasn’t something Leng Shaoting wanted to see. In addition, Gu Ning would be stressed if Leng Shaoting placed a lot of weight on her shoulders. Therefore, they decided to let Gu Ning stand at the end of the line, and she could hug Leng Shaoting’s waist.

“Take me as the supporting point, and you won’t fall,” Shangguan Yang said.

When Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were ready, Shangguan Yang lifted the sword, until it was about a meter above the ground. Without delay, it moved fast ahead.

Even though it wasn’t faster than the flood dragon, it was much faster than a car.

At the beginning, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning felt uncomfortable standing on it, but they soon got used to it.

Shangguan Yang felt quite disappointed when they arrived at the foot of the Kunlun Mountain. “I indeed can’t feel much magical power here.” He finally realized that the world really had changed.

On the way, Gu Ning reminded Shangguan Yang not to expose the secret that he was a senior cultivator to other people he saw in this new world. It would cause him much trouble if other people found that he was very different from them.

Leng Shaoting could protect Shangguan Yang, but none of them wanted to be involved in trouble. If it was possible, they should avoid trouble.

Shangguan Yang agreed and simply wanted to enjoy himself in the new world.

Gu Ning also told him there were other cultivators in this new world, and there was a cultivation world in addition to the mortals’ world, but there was a boundary between them.

Shangguan Yang was excited when Gu Ning told him that, so he asked her whether she knew where the cultivation world was. He was interested in going there, and Gu Ning had the same idea.

They began to walk later in case there were other people on the road ahead of them. Nevertheless, Shangguan Yang needed to change his clothes, because he was still in an ancient suit.

Gu Ning took out Leng Shaoting’s coat from her telepathic eye space and gave it to Shangguan Yang.

There were many kinds of clothes in her telepathic eye space for different seasons.

Shangguan Yang put it on at once, because he didn’t want to look strange in the new world. From now on, he should do as the locals do. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Even though Shangguan Yang had stayed at the top of the mountain for hundreds of years, he knew the importance of personal hygiene and there was a hot spring behind the tower. He often visited it. His clothing was also hundreds of years old, but it wasn’t broken at all because of the nourishment of magical power.

He changed his clothes, but his hairstyle remained the same. It wasn’t a big problem, because many artists liked to tie their hair into a bun too. Therefore, Shangguan Yang’s look was normal now.

When they left the mountain, no one paid special attention to them.

There were still many visitors at this time. However, once they moved near the Supreme Deity’s abode, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting could receive signals again and many new messages came into their phones.

Shangguan Yang was confused when he saw their phones. “What is this? Why is it making strange sounds?”

Hearing that, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were amused, but they didn’t laugh at Shangguan Yang. Shangguan Yang didn’t live in modern society, so it was very normal that he didn’t know what a smartphone was.

“This is a smartphone, we can use it to contact other people as long as there is a signal,” Gu Ning said.
