Chapter 1218 – Jiang Dina Needs a Lesson

Cao Wenxin’s wound on her face soon healed after she took Gu Ning’s magical pill, so she was able to talk normally now.

“What?” Qin Zifeng and his friends were shocked.

“Cao Wenxin, don’t try to scare us. We all know that Master Tang only has two grandsons!” Qin Zifeng argued.

“I’m not scaring you; you can go home and ask your parents for the answer,” Cao Wenxin said.

Qin Zifeng’s and Jiang Dina’s parents had been invited to attend Tang Yunfan and Gu Man’s wedding that day, so their parents had to be aware of the fact that Gu Ning was Tang Yunfan’s biological daughter.

Although Qin Zifeng, Jiang Dina, and Cao Wenxin never got along with each other, it didn’t affect their families’ relationship with one another.

Since Cao Wenxin said that, it was highly likely to be true, but Qin Zifeng couldn’t understand why Master Tang suddenly had a granddaughter who was the same age as them. He thought that Gu Ning might be Tang Yunfan’s illegitimate girl.

Either way, Qin Zifeng didn’t dare to fight against Gu Ning now.

“Zifeng, let’s call an ambulance now!” Qin Zifeng’s friend said.

“Do it right now!” Qin Zifeng vented his anger at his friend.

The fight lasted for five minutes, and the manager of this amusement park came soon after. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“What is wrong with you teenagers? Why are you fighting so violently here?” the manager snapped at them.

The next second, his sight fell on Jiang Dina, he got nervous when he saw her injury.

“They attacked us first,” Cao Wenxin said.

“I don’t care who attacked whom first. We need to call the police,” the manager said.

“We already made the call, and the police will be right here,” a staff member said.

A couple of minutes later, the police came.

Cao Wenxin glanced at the policemen, then asked Qin Zifeng, “Do you want to go to court, or to settle it now?

“Out of court,” Qin Zifeng said without hesitation.

In fact, it wouldn’t make a difference even if they went to court, because they simply needed to pay the medical fee for the injured ones.

Jiang Dina understood that as well, so she agreed too.

Since they were willing to settle it out of court themselves, the police left soon.

“Jiang Dina, bear in mind that you should stay away from me. If you dare to cause me trouble again, think about the lesson you’ve learned today,” Cao Wenxin coldly said to Jiang Dina.

“I don’t lack money at all, so I don’t mind paying for your medical fees if you want to lie in a hospital bed for a few months.”

Because of the rules in the Cao family, Cao Wenxin didn’t have much allowance in the past, but now she had five hundred million yuan after going to the Earth Nightclub with Gu Ning. With this large amount of money in her pocket, Cao Wenxin could afford anything she wanted to.

She was pleased and satisfied when Jiang Dina learned a lesson today, and she was more than willing to pay the medical fee for her. It didn’t cost much anyway.

Jiang Dina was out of strength now, so she could only glare at Cao Wenxin. She blamed Cao Wenxin for everything, and didn’t think that she had done anything wrong. Now that one of her ribs was broken, she hated Cao Wenxin more than ever.

Jiang Dina also got to know Gu Ning today. She was afraid of Gu Ning, who was Master Tang’s granddaughter and also Cao Wenxin’s good friend.

Anyway, she was determined to pay Cao Wenxin or Gu Ning back.

“Alright, let’s go enjoy ourselves now,” Cao Wenxin said and walked away with her friends.

When they walked far away, Cao Wenxin was still excited.

“Ningning, you showed up at the best time!” Cao Wenxin said. “I felt so good when Jiang Dina was injured. I don’t think she will dare to cause trouble for me in the future.”

“Does she do this often?” Gu Ning asked.

“Yeah, she’s been a bully ever since we were kids, but I refuse to give in so we often fight,” Cao Wenxin said. “If Qin Zifeng isn’t with her, or my older brother is with me, I am usually fine.”

In that case, Jiang Dina indeed needed a lesson.

“Ningning, given my understanding of Jiang Dina, it’s impossible that she’ll give up after this. I know you’re smart and strong, but you still need to be careful,” Cao Wenxin said.

“I will,” Gu Ning said.

“Wow, Miss Gu, your special medicine is really unbelievable!” Jiang Zezheng said.
