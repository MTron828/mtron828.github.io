Chapter 1320: An Unqualified Killer

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Director Yao was in the branch now, and he didn’t dare to leave once he heard that Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were coming today. However, Gu Ning needed to see Luca without Director Yao being there this time, so she told him that she would talk with the suspect alone later.

Director Yao absolutely agreed.

About 20 minutes later, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting arrived.

Because it was daytime, all the policemen were in the branch.

“Goddess Gu?” A policeman was super excited when he recognized Gu Ning.

The news about Gu Ning’s brave behavior on the Internet was quite popular and many policemen admired her bravery and ability.

“Hi!” Gu Ning smiled at him since she was recognized.

“Goddess Gu, did you come here to interrogate the suspect? Please follow me this way,” the policeman said.

Every policeman in the branch was aware of the car accident by now. They also knew that it was an attempted murder, but they weren’t clear about Leng Shaoting’s background. Because Leng Shaoting’s background was too special, Director Yao didn’t tell them.

“Thanks,” Gu Ning said.

“My pleasure,” the policeman said and guided the way.

Many people in the branch recognized Gu Ning too, and greeted Gu Ning with a smile.

Director Yao walked out later, but he didn’t follow Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting up, because Gu Ning already told him that they would be seeing the suspect alone.

“Miss Gu, I’ve turned off the surveillance cameras in the room, so you can do what you need to do next,” Director Yao said.

“Thank you very much,” Gu Ning said.

After that, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting walked into the interrogation room, and the two bodyguards left to guard the door.

Although Luca was kept in the room, he was treated well and had enough food and water. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Luca knew that it would be very hard for him to escape, so he accepted reality and stayed obedient.

Director Yao had turned off all the surveillance cameras in the room, but Gu Ning had prepared her own camera. She placed it on the table which directly faced Luca.

Luca glanced at it, but didn’t think that it was a big deal.

“Have you made up your mind yet? Tell us or not?” Gu Ning asked. Even though she already had the answer, she still wanted to hear it from Luca.

Luca remained silent.

“If you tell me a name, I can let you live, otherwise you’ll be killed,” Gu Ning added.

“You can’t kill me. It’s illegal,” Luca said all of a sudden.

“Is it legal to murder me?” Gu Ning thought it was ridiculous.

“Do you have any proof?” Luca argued.

Gu Ning sneered and sneered. “Luca, you shouldn’t be so dumb.”

Hearing Gu Ning call his name, Luca squinted at her. He wasn’t surprised because he knew that Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl, but he closed his mouth again.

Gu Ning didn’t mind, and continued, “Luca, a member of the Mafia in Country Y. Used to be a killer, but later was transferred to be a security guard after breaking the organization rules...”

The next second, Luca rounded his eyes in shock staring at Gu Ning. He couldn’t believe that she was able to get such detailed information about him.

“A businessman named Smith helped someone else make the murder deal with you. The real hirer is a woman, right?” Gu Ning said with a faint smile on her lips.

“You...” Luca opened his mouth. He wanted to say something, but closed his mouth again. He couldn’t deny what Gu Ning just said to him.

“Do you want to say anything now?” Gu Ning asked.

Gu Ning had already done a thorough investigation on him, so there was nothing else he could say now.

“Since you still choose to be silent, you can just wait for the punishment,” Gu Ning said. She was unwilling to waste time on Luca.

“How did you know?” Luca asked in the end.

Luca understood that he was doomed to be punished, but he was curious to know how Gu Ning got to know so much about him.

“Have you done research on me before you conducted the attempt on my life?” Gu Ning asked.

“Your name is Gu Ning, 19 years old, born in City F. You often visit the capital and City B. You would appear at the airport and fly back to City B from the capital yesterday,” Luca replied.

In fact, a woman called Amy told him everything, and he knew nothing about Gu Ning and her achievements, or any of the news about her on the Internet. He was from Country Y, and couldn’t care less about the news in another country.

“You’re an unqualified killer,” Gu Ning sneered. “How did you dare to try to murder me before you even learned all of the information about me?”
