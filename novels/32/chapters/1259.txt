: To Encourage Her

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

No matter what position Tang Yunfan held in Tanghuang, he must be very important, so Yuan Jisong needed to be polite.

“Nice to see you, Secretary Yuan. I’ve heard about you from my secretary and I need to thank you for your help when I was caught in the car accident last time,” Tang Yunfan said to Yuan Jisong and they shook hands with each other.

“You’re welcome. Actually I did nothing, and the credit should go to Miss Gu,” Yuan Jisong said.

“You’re being too modest. Although it’s Ningning who saved my life, your help was also very essential!” Tang Yunfan thanked Yuan Jisong again. Without Yuan Jisong’s timely help, he might not be saved. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Even if Tang Yunfan didn’t prepare a gift for Yuan Jisong, it was necessary for him to thank Yuan Jisong face to face.

“Uncle Yuan, you don’t need to be so modest. It’s true that you’ve helped us a lot,” Gu Ning said.

“Well...” Yuan Jisong didn’t know what to say.

They chatted with one another for a short while before they left.

After walking out of the hotel, Chu Peihan and the others separated from Gu Ning. Because Gu Ning’s family was here, there was no need for them to stay.

Gu Ning proposed to drive Chu Peihan and her other friends back, but they declined. They said that they could just take taxis.

Gu Ning didn’t insist, and went back to Fenghua Luxury Mansion with her family.

Jiang Xu was busy, so he didn’t go home with them. Gu Qing, however, hadn’t seen Gu Man for a long time, so she wanted to spend more time with Gu Man.

...

Once Gu Ning and her family were gone, Yuan Jisong asked Manager Mu, “Manager Mu, may I know who Chairman Tang is?”

Hearing that, Manager Mu was surprised. “Secretary Yuan, you don’t know Chairman Tang’s background?”

“I don’t know much about him.” Yuan Jisong felt a little embarrassed.

“Chairman Tang is the chairman of Tanghuang, the most famous business group in City B, and his full name is Tang Yunfan. The old man is his father and the woman who just stood by his side is his wife. Miss Gu is their daughter,” Manager Mu said.

What? Gu Ning’s Tang Yunfan’s biological daughter?

Yuan Jisong couldn’t believe it. He had thought that Gu Ning was Tang Yunfan’s step-daughter! Gu Ning was indeed a girl who was full of surprises.

Yuan Jisong had a deeper impression of Gu Ning now.

...

Gu Ning didn’t have time to reply to her friends’ messages until she was home. She then thanked them for their care.

There were three rooms in the apartment, which were enough for them to stay in.

Gu Man and Tang Yunfan were a couple, so they could stay in one room. Gu Ning stayed in her own bedroom, and Tang Haifeng would stay in the guest bedroom. As for their bodyguards, they stayed in a hotel.

Tang Haifeng was an old man, and he needed to take a nap at noon. Therefore, he left to have a rest when they got home.

Gu Ning went back to her bedroom later. She soon received Leng Shaoting’s call, and Leng Shaoting told her that he was in City F now. He came to encourage her for the National College Entrance Examination.

Gu Ning was thrilled to see Leng Shaoting. At the same time, she felt touched that her family and her boyfriend cared so much about her.

It was only 2:30 pm, and they normally had dinner at 6 pm, so Gu Ning left earlier to meet Leng Shaoting.

Because it was Tang Haifeng’s first time in City F, Gu Ning didn’t have much time to be with Leng Shaoting because her family was there, so she decided to spend as much time with her boyfriend as she could now that she was free.

When Gu Ning left, she told Gu Man that Leng Shaoting came, and that he would be having dinner with them.

Because the Tang family already accepted Leng Shaoting, they took Leng Shaoting as one of their members.

...

Gu Ning drove her car to the gate of Fenghua Luxury Mansion to wait for Leng Shaoting, and Leng Shaoting arrived about five minutes later in a taxi.

He recognized Gu Ning’s car at first glance, so he got out of the taxi right away. He was wearing all black, and looked more mysterious and attractive than ever.

Gu Ning sat in the front passenger’s seat and stared at Leng Shaoting’s sexy body when he moved towards her. She couldn’t help but think of his naked body.

Leng Shaoting noticed her expression and smiled at her. Gu Ning felt embarrassed and said, “Um, why don’t you drive the car?”

“My pleasure,” Leng Shaoting agreed.

Afterwards, he got in the car, but didn’t start it. “Ningning, what were you thinking just then?” he asked Gu Ning all of a sudden.
