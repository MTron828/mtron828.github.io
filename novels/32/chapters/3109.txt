3111 I Can

“How much do you like me?” Chu Jianan asked.

“I like you so much that I wish I could be with you,” Jiang Yihan admitted. It was her dream so she decided to do it.

“In fact, I also want to be together with you after being amazed by you today. Unfortunately, Leng Yuqi and I aren’t over yet. Our families don’t want us to be together, but I don’t want to hurt her, so…” Chu Jianan trailed off, seeming to find it difficult.

This time, it was Chu Jianan’s real thought. Jiang Yihan was more important than Leng Yuqi in his heart, and he had the idea of leaving Leng Yuqi for Jiang Yihan.

!!

After all, he had been together with Leng Yuqi for a long time. He didn’t feel excited any longer, whereas Jiang Yihan was completely new.

However, he had really loved Leng Yuqi, while he only wanted a new experience with Jiang Yihan.

He planned to marry Leng Yuqi, while he only wanted to have sex with Jiang Yihan.

Sometimes, a new experience was enough to defeat an old romantic relationship, especially when the romantic relationship wasn’t going well.

He wasn’t together with Jiang Yihan yet, so he didn’t know whether their sexual relationship could last. If Jiang Yihan made him fall in love with her, he might marry her in the future.

“I can wait for you. Jianan, if you want to be together with me as well, I can wait till you separate with Yuqi, but if you continue to be with her, I’ll keep my love for you to myself. I won’t ruin your relationship,” Jiang Yihan said emotionally. She wanted Chu Jianan to know her real thoughts.

She sounded very considerate! It seemed she loved Chu Jianan deeply, but only people without moral standards would agree with Jiang Yihan. Normal people would think her behavior was unacceptable.

It wasn’t wrong that Jiang Yihan fell in love with Chu Jianan. After all, it was hard to control one’s emotions, but Jiang Yihan was wrong when she told Chu Jianan about that even before he separated from Leng Yuqi.

Not only that, but she also behaved intimately with Chu Jianan.

Chu Jianan didn’t have moral standards, so he felt very satisfied when Jiang Yihan said that to him. He didn’t disdain her, because she loved him so much!

“Won’t you feel wronged?” Chu Jianan asked, seemingly sad.

If he didn’t act loving, Jiang Yihan wouldn’t be trapped.

“I won’t feel wronged. I’m only afraid that it’ll end up as nothing,” Jiang Yihan said worriedly.

“Impossible! If it’ll end up as nothing, I wouldn’t have said this to you. I don’t want you to think that I want you while I already have a girlfriend, but I can’t control it. I’m really attracted to you. I feel really uncomfortable and I won’t feel better till I have you,” Chu Jianan said. He indeed felt uncomfortable and couldn’t wait to sleep with Jiang Yihan.

“I-I-I…” Jiang Yihan was excited and was persuaded by Chu Jianan.

“I-If you’re really uncomfortable. I can…” Jiang Yihan flushed. She was willing to have sex with him, but she couldn’t say that because she was nervous and shy.

However, Chu Jianan could already understand her feelings. He was excited, but still pretended to respect her. “Can you? Although I want to have you, I don’t want to force you…”

“Yeah, of course,” Jiang Yihan said. She felt respected by Chu Jianan and had a better impression of him.

However, if Chu Jianan really respected her, he wouldn’t have thought of having sex with her nor would he have taken action.

After Jiang Yihan agreed, Chu Jianan couldn’t control himself any longer. He immediately kissed her, then pressed her down.

Even though Jiang Yihan stiffened, she didn’t push him away. Instead, she was looking forward to it.

Chu Jianan had slept with Leng Yuqi and other women before. Although it didn’t happen often, he was very familiar with sex. Therefore, he quickly made Jiang Yihan relax and she began to enjoy it.

When he penetrated Jiang Yihan, Jiang Yihan felt extreme pain because it was her first time.

Chu Jianan was aware that Jiang Yihan was a virgin, but he was still excited when he had taken her virginity. The next moment, he was even more vigorous.

However Chu Jianan understood that he should care about Jiang Yihan’s feelings, so he didn’t speed up until Jiang Yihan was able to handle it.

After a while, Jiang Yihan couldn’t feel the pain and was comfortable. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“How do you feel now? Is it still painful?” Chu Jianan asked.

“It’s not,” Jiang Yihan said.

“Is it comfortable?” Chu Jianan asked.

However, Jiang Yihan was too shy to answer him, so she said nothing.

“Is it comfortable? I want both of us to feel comfortable. If you don’t tell me, I won’t know what to do next,” Chu Jianan said. He could see that Jiang Yihan was enjoying it, but he still wanted to hear the answer from her mouth because it would get him more excited.

Jiang Yihan was afraid that Chu Jianan would lose interest, so she said, “Yes.”

Hearing Jiang Yihan’s answer, Chu Jianan was satisfied.

“Do you want it to be fast or slow?” Chu Jianan asked.

“Both…” Jiang Yihan said.

In that case, Chu Jianan alternated between fast and slow.

During that time, Chu Jianan received messages and calls from Leng Yuqi, but he hated being interrupted, so he turned his phone on silent and didn’t know what was coming through.

Even if he knew, he wouldn’t care. After all, he was busy having sex!

Because Chu Jianan didn’t reply to Leng Yuqi, Leng Yuqi felt irritated.

She understood that Chu Jianan might be busy with work and didn’t see her messages and calls, but she couldn’t help thinking about it. In her eyes, her relationship with Chu Jianan was in a crisis.

…

Chu Jianan was exhausted after having sex with Jiang Yihan for more than half an hour. He didn’t stop until he was out of strength.

He only rested for a while, because they were tired, but not satisfied yet.

Chu Jianan didn’t want to stop, but he was worn out.
