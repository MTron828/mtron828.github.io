936 Aren“t You Going to Take a Shower?

She had heard a lot about Goddess Gu, but she didn’t know that Goddess Gu was Gu Ning.

To her astonishment, the most popular girl on the Internet right now was Pan Zirui’s friend.

...

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to the parking lot together.

Leng Shaoting’s car was already parked there.

Once they got in the car, Leng Shaoting said, “Ningning, why don’t we go to a hotel?”

Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second. “Why?”

There was burning desire in Leng Shaoting’s eyes. “They’ll hear us if we make too much noise.”

Hearing that, Gu Ning flushed. She realized what Leng Shaoting wanted to do with her.

Leng Shaoting was right. It would be utterly embarrassing if Gao Yi and Qiao Ya heard them making love at home. Therefore, Gu Ning called Qiao Ya and told her that she wouldn’t be going back home tonight.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya were a couple after all, and they needed private time too. They were also unwilling to have sex in Gu Ning’s house, so they went to stay at a hotel as well.

Gu Ning planned to let Gao Yi and Qiao Ya live nextdoor to her house when they went to the capital. They would start a family in the future anyway.

Chen Cangyi was in charge of the construction of her house in the capital, which might be done within a month. After airing it for several months, she could directly move in.

Gu Ning was going to have a fixed abode in the capital, so she told Chen Cangyi to buy a house for her.

The house was in a high-end living area, which wasn’t far from the office building of the Shengning Group. Because of the high housing price, many of the houses in that area were still unsold.

There were two houses which were near to each other, so Gu Ning told Chen Cangyi to acquire them without hesitation. Chen Cangyi and K also lived in that area.

...

There was a lingerie store next to the hotel, so Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting to stop the car. She needed to buy underwear and a sleeping gown. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Afterwards, they booked into the hotel.

Leng Shaoting didn’t press Gu Ning against the entryway this time, because he was carrying a lot of things things in his hands. However, the moment he put those things down, he hugged Gu Ning and kissed her.

As the kiss went wild, they wanted more. Right as Leng Shaoting was about to undress Gu Ning, his phone rang.

It was super annoying when someone interrupted them during sex, but he had to answer it because the call was from his grandfather.

Gu Ning left him alone and went to take a shower first.

“Hi, grandpa, what’s up?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“Did you go to HK?” Master Leng asked, although he already had the answer.

“Yeah,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Do you think that I can’t recognize you just because you were wearing a pair of sunglasses?” Master Leng sounded proud of himself.

Leng Shaoting, however, was surprised.

“How did you know that I went to HK?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“I just read a piece of news about a girl named Tang Aining who has won the gambling competition against Fan Zhihao in HK, and you followed her,” Master Leng said. “What? Was it your task for you became her bodyguard?”

Master Leng didn’t know that “Tang Aining” was Gu Ning, so he thought that it was Leng Shaoting’s task to protect her.

Leng Shaoting had no intention to tell Master Leng the truth, so he gave his grandfather an affirmative answer.

Master Leng thought that it was a little ridiculous, because Leng Shaoting was a major general after all, but he didn’t say anything about it.

“When can you bring my future grand daughter-in-law to visit me?” Master Leng suddenly thought of Gu Ning. He really wanted to see her in person one day.

“In a little while,” Leng Shaoting said.

Since his grandfather liked Gu Ning very much, Leng Shaoting was happy to introduce her to his grandfather. He didn’t care about the rest of his family’s opinions.

“How long is a while?” Master Leng asked again. He couldn’t wait to meet Gu Ning.

“Three months later I guess. She’s going to write the National College Entrance Examination then,” Leng Shaoting said.

It was April now, and the National College Entrance Examination was just two months away. Students would start to register to universities a month afterwards, so Leng Shaoting could bring Gu Ning to visit his grandfather in the capital then.

“It’s so long!” Master Leng was upset.

After hanging up the call with Master Leng, Leng Shaoting took off his own clothes, and only wore boxer briefs in the room. He was going to take a shower too.

When Gu Ning walked out later, she flushed at seeing the nearly naked Leng Shaoting, especially when her sight fell on his crotch.

Leng Shaoting, at the same time, felt aroused staring at Gu Ning’s sexy body in a black lace nightdress with her tits standing up.

“Um, aren’t you going to take a shower?” Gu Ning opened her mouth, and wanted to walk away, but Leng Shaoting stopped her and kissed her again.
