2892 Let’s Do It First!

After the plane took off, Jancis watched Leng Shaoting taking great care of Gu Ning, so he had a new idea.

Although Gu Ning said she had a jealous husband, her husband treated her very well.

The flight finally finished eight hours later. At 6:50 am the plane landed at Niguli International Airport.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting deliberately walked behind Jancis to see what he was going to do.

Jancis stopped paying attention to them, and he took a taxi.

Seeing that, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were sure that their meeting was just a coincidence. There was no scheme, so they were relieved and directly went to the parking lot.

Leng Shaoting made all the arrangements. He had acquaintances on Niguli Island, so his friend arranged the house and car for them to live in.

They met the person who came to pick them up at the parking lot, then left in a car.

More than half an hour later, they arrived at a high-end holiday villa area by the sea and stopped in front of a villa. The driver handed over the car key to Leng Shaoting before leaving.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t rush to go anywhere, so they went into the house to have a look first.

“It is just the two of us. It’s so luxurious to have such a large house,” Gu Ning said.

“The sea here is of good quality and has a variety of sea animals, so there are mainly large houses. Anyway, this house is owned by my friend, so it’s free,” Leng Shaoting said.

Gu Ning tutted. “Oh!”

She didn’t think it was wrong for them to stay in Leng Shaoting’s friend’s house for free. Since his friend was willing to let them use this house for free, it meant they were close.

“The photographer team will arrive tomorrow. We can take the wedding photos the day after tomorrow. So, we can just enjoy ourselves today and tomorrow. Let’s go inside and have a look!” Leng Shaoting said. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Great!” Gu Ning replied, then they went inside.

The house was simply decorated without many accessories, which was Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s favorite style. It was comfortable to live in.

The main door of the villa didn’t face the sea, but after entering the villa, directly opposite the main door was the back door, and behind the back door was the sea. It was only ten meters away from the villa.

Outside the back door was a large terrace with a swimming pool and a gazebo.

As soon as Gu Ning went in, she walked directly to the back door. Looking at the endless sea, she felt refreshed. She couldn’t help but open her hands to feel the sea breeze blowing past.

Just after Gu Ning opened her arms, Leng Shaoting hugged her from behind and asked her, “Do you want to eat something or rest first?”

“I’m not hungry. I’ll eat later. I’m not tired either. I don’t need to rest,” Gu Ning said. She was eager to go to the sea to catch seafood.

“If you’re neither hungry nor tired, let’s do something first!” Leng Shaoting suddenly said ambiguously.

“What?” Gu Ning didn’t realize something wasn’t right with Leng Shaoting.

“Well, it’s something we both love.” Leng Shaoting chuckled, then directly carried Gu Ning and walked into the living room, then went upstairs to the bedroom.

Gu Ning didn’t struggle, but put on a resigned look. “Is sex all that’s on your mind?”

“Don’t you want to?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“Of course I do. I can’t wait to experience your manhood.” Gu Ning was no longer shy in bed. Instead, she was bold and sometimes horny. She even dared to tease Leng Shaoting once in a while. Leng Shaoting could never say no to her.

Although they had been together for three years, Leng Shaoting still couldn’t get enough of Gu Ning.

Even if Gu Ning did nothing, he wanted her badly. So the moment she seduced him, he was aroused with burning desire.

“You seductive little girl. Let me teach you a lesson in bed.” Leng Shaoting’s voice was full of desire. His voice became hoarse and he breathed heavily. Without delay, he sped up.

The moment they were in the bedroom, Leng Shaoting threw Gu Ning onto the bed, then pressed her against it.

Before long, both of them were undressed.

However, no matter how eager he was, he wouldn’t penetrate her right away. They enjoyed foreplay first, and he only penetrated her when both of them were fully aroused.

“Oh, you’re so good, baby!”

In the past, Leng Shaoting had to beg her for compliments, but now Gu Ning would do it without him asking. She was no longer embarrassed.

Gu Ning’s compliment filled Leng Shaoting with vigor, and he moved faster.

They didn’t go downstairs until 11 am.

“What do you want to eat?” Leng Shaoting asked. Everything they could want to eat was in the fridge since Leng Shaoting had asked his friend to prepare ingredients for them.

Gu Ning wanted to catch seafood by herself, so Leng Shaoting didn’t tell his friend to prepare seafood for them, but there were enough vegetables.

“I’ll cook. You can go catch some shrimp and fish. We don’t need too many. Just catch enough for a meal. I’ll go into the sea and catch some more this afternoon,” Gu Ning replied.

“Sure,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Wait a second. We can let the flood dragons stay in the ocean these next few days,” Gu Ning said. Saying that, she let the female white flood dragon out, and Leng Shaoting put it into his Qiankun Bag.

Flood dragons lived in the ocean, so Gu Ning decided to let them swim freely since they were here now.

After two years, the flood dragon had improved a lot, so did Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

Currently, Leng Shaoting had reached the peak of the Yuan Ying Period, while Gu Ning was at the peak of the Golden Core Stage. She also learned to fly with a sword, but was not very good yet.

However, Leng Shaoting was very familiar with it by now.

Because this was a luxurious resort, there weren’t many people around. A few were ambling on the beach, but they weren’t close, so it was convenient for Leng Shaoting to go into the sea.

About ten minutes later, Leng Shaoting was back with three to four catties of prawns, two big crabs, and two catties of fish.

He was out only for ten minutes, but he actually went deep into the ocean. There weren’t many good sea animals in the shallow areas, so he dove deep.

Nobody saw him go into the ocean, but some people who ambled along the beach saw him come out.

Fishing seafood wasn’t prohibited here, but it wasn’t allowed to fish in large quantities.

Therefore, the people who saw him take out a bag of seafood from the sea didn’t accuse him of poaching seafood, but they were surprised that he could fish so many things from the sea without any equipment.

One of the men stepped forward and asked, “Excuse me, did you fish in the sea like this? Without any equipment?”

The man spoke Language Y because he didn’t know which country Leng Shaoting was from, and Language Y was more commonly used on this island.
