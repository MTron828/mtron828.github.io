Chapter 303 He Challenged Me

After he hung up the call with his grandpa, Leng Shaoting asked Gu Ning, “Do you want to meet my grandpa later?”

“No, I’m not mentally prepared yet!” Gu Ning rejected. Thinking of meeting his family, Gu Ning got nervous all of a sudden.

Leng Shaoting told her that he only cared about his grandpa among the Leng Family, so Gu Ning valued his grandpa’s opinion of her most, but she just thought that it wasn’t the right time to meet his family.

Leng Shaoting didn’t insist. “Then I’ll first take you to where I live after we meet Situ Ye, and then I’ll go back to the Leng Family house.”

“Sure,” Gu Ning replied.

In fact, Gu Ning could stay in the Huangdeng Hotel for free, but she didn’t want to turn Leng Shaoting down.

When the plane had just landed at the airport and was still moving, Situ Ye couldn’t wait to turn his phone on. He knew that Gu Ning would definitely have replied to his message. He was right. Situ Ye called Gu Ning without delay after reading her message.

“Gu Ning, where are you now?” Situ Ye asked. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I’m in the Jinlin Hotel. Have you arrived yet?” Gu Ning asked.

“Yes, but I haven’t gotten off the plane yet. I’ll be right there,” Situ Ye said.

“Great,” Gu Ning said before she hung up.

Situ Ye had told someone to prepare a car for him before he boarded the plane, so he quickly drove to the Jinlin Hotel the minute that he left the airport.

Even though he knew that Gu Ning was fine and safe, he was in a hurry to meet her. Thus he drove at a high speed, exceeding the speed limit along the way. Normally it would take at least 50 minutes to get there; he spent less than 30 minutes on the road. Once he got out of the car, Situ Ye called Gu Ning.

Gu Ning told him the number of the private room, and Situ Ye ran to it without delay.

“Come on in please,” Gu Ning said when Situ Ye knocked on the door.

Situ Ye was excited to meet Gu Ning, but he was soon struck dumb when Leng Shaoting appeared in his sight too.

“It’s you?”

Situ Ye had met Leng Shaoting before in a fight, so he had a grudge against Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting only gave him a glance, and stayed calm.

“Hi!” Gu Ning immediately welcomed him. Although she was displeased that Situ Ye showed obvious dislike towards Leng Shaoting, she didn’t show it. She understood that there was an old grudge between them. Leng Shaoting had ruined Situ Ye’s plans before, so Situ Ye naturally hated Leng Shaoting. However, as long as they didn’t fight again, Gu Ning wouldn’t interfere.

Seeing Gu Ning, Situ Ye instantly changed his attitude and tone. “I’m so glad to see that you’re fine.”

“Thank you so much. I feel guilty that you flew all the way to visit me. If you don’t mind, please stay and have dinner with us,” Gu Ning said.

“We’re friends! And I should care more about you,” Situ Ye said airily. At the same time, he was shocked to see that Gu Ning was with Leng Shaoting. Is Leng Shaoting Gu Ning’s boyfriend? Thinking of that, Situ Ye was stunned, because there was a clear abyss between Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning. It would be extremely shocking if they were a couple.

Situ Ye was also worried that Gu Ning probably already knew his identity. Although he wasn’t sure, it was highly possible. If Gu Ning knew his identity, why she was still willing to make friends with him, instead of keeping a distance away from him like everyone else? Maybe Leng Shaoting didn’t tell her the truth for her safety.

No matter what, since Gu Ning didn’t point it out, Situ Ye decided not to say it. He didn’t ask about their relationship either, but had a plan in his mind. “Of course I’m willing to dine with you. You’ve always promised to invite me to have a meal together, and now you finally fulfill your promise,” Situ Ye said to Gu Ning.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting immediately sensed what was on his mind. Gu Ning didn’t think it was a big deal, but Leng Shaoting was greatly displeased. He met Situ Ye’s eyes with strong hatred in his gaze.

“Well then please have a rest in your room first. I’ve reserved a room for you, and we can have dinner around six pm tonight. We’ve had a long journey in the plane today, and we also need a rest,” Gu Ning said. She intentionally made an excuse to separate the two men.

Situ Ye was disappointed, but he understood that Gu Ning had had a long day today. When he left, Situ Ye gave Leng Shaoting a meaningful and provocative glance. He had already made up his mind to compete with Leng Shaoting for Gu Ning. Although Leng Shaoting was Gu Ning’s boyfriend now, they weren’t married yet and the future was unpredictable!

Gu Ning was too young to get married yet, so he still had several years to chase her.

“He challenged me!” Leng Shaoting complained after Situ Ye

was gone.

“Ha-ha,” Gu Ning snorted with laughter seeing Leng Shaoting’s aggrieved face. She thought that it probably wasn’t a good idea for her to have let the two men meet each other today. Nevertheless, it had already happened, so Gu Ning left it, but asked Leng Shaoting, “Do you lack confidence in yourself, or me?”

Leng Shaoting didn’t answer her question, but suddenly hugged Gu Ning and kissed her. He indeed lacked confidence in both of them. They weren’t married yet, and anything could happen before that. In fact, what worried Leng Shaoting the most was that he could die during one of his tasks. It was the first time that he had been so terrified of death. If he died, he would lose Gu Ning forever.

Leng Shaoting vented his anxiety by kissing Gu Ning wildly.

Gu Ning understood that Leng Shaoting felt a sense of crisis now. Even though she promised that she would stay by his side, no one knew what would happen in the future.
