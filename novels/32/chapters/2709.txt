However, he wouldn’t let Liang Hongfeng take over the Liang family’s properties. After all, Liang Hongfeng had married into another family and didn’t have a son. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Nevertheless, Liang Hongfeng could inherit some of the Liang family wealth, although he had his own business.

Jing Yunchan felt aggrieved and wanted to argue, but didn’t dare to say anything.

Once Old Mr. Liang finished speaking, he turned around saying nothing further, as did Old Mrs. Liang.

The others also walked away, leaving only Liang Hongfeng.

Even though Liang Hongfeng was really mad at Jing Yuelan, she was his daughter after all so he had to do something.

Because she was his only child, he couldn’t leave her in trouble. Therefore, he sent people to fetch a doctor, then carried Jing Yuelan back to the room.

“Hongfeng, what should we do now?” Jing Yunchan followed behind Liang Hongfeng and asked anxiously.

“What can we do? We can only pay the money. Didn’t you hear what my parents said? The Liang family won’t pay a cent for it. I don’t have that much cash now. I can only pay seventy million yuan, so you should go to check your dowries. Sell some of it,” said Liang Hongfeng.

Liang Hongfeng’s business had hundreds of million yuan in assets, but he didn’t have much cash, because most of his properties were fixed assets.

Seventy million yuan was all the money he could take out. After all, he couldn’t sell his business. They still needed income to live in the future!

The Liang family could accommodate them, but Liang Hongfeng had his own ambition and wanted to build up a successful business.

“What? You want me to sell my dowries?” Jing Yunchan couldn’t accept that. If she sold her dowries, she would lose her security.

......

Although Liang Hongfeng treated her very well, she had already lost the Jing family’s support. Therefore, she had to have enough wealth in her own hands.

“Or what? You should take responsibility for the mistake Yuelan made. Are you trying to hurl the burden on me? Is money more important than Yuelan to you?” Liang Hongfeng was angry. He couldn’t believe Jing Yunchan still wanted to keep her dowries at this moment.

“I didn’t mean that…” Jing Yunchan denied at once. Money definitely wasn’t more important than her daughter, because she only had one daughter. Therefore, whether she wanted to or not, she had to do it.

…

The news that Gu Ning’s stores were smashed soon went abroad. The Tang family, the Leng family, Jing Yunyao, and many other people heard about it. As a result, once Gu Ning was out of the cultivation world, she saw over a dozen missed calls.

Gu Ning called Tang Haifeng back first, then called Master Leng and Jing Yunyao.

Gu Ning didn’t give a detailed explanation to Tang Haifeng and Master Leng. She only told them that someone caused her trouble, but that the problem was already solved.

However, she told Jing Yunyao everything, and Jing Yunyao apologized to her as soon as she answered the call. She knew that Gu Ning was dragged into trouble because of her.

Gu Ning didn’t blame Jing Yunyao, because it wasn’t Jing Yunyao’s fault.

Gu Ning also told Jing Yunyao that she took Jing Yuelan to the cultivation world to get compensation. Jing Jining would deal with it. Jing Jining was the Jing family’s patriarch, so he could handle it.

The police wanted to help, but Gu Ning said that she had decided to settle it out of court.

Because Jing Yuelan was a cultivator, she couldn’t deal with it in the mortal world.

Gu Ning’s conversation with Jing Yuelan didn’t spread, so not many people knew the reason and they were guessing about it.

After Gu Ning came out of the cultivation world, she went directly back to her school. She didn’t need to deal with the damage on her own since Chen Cangyi would fix it. They just needed to know how much the loss was.

When Gu Ning was back at school, the students had just finished their afternoon classes, so she went to dine with her friends.

Everyone asked Gu Ning about the news once they met, and they seriously disliked the woman who caused the damage.

They believed that Gu Ning was innocent.

The video of Gu Ning fighting against Jing Yuelan was already uploaded to the Internet, so Baili Zongxue knew that the girl was Jing Yuelan. Actually, Baili Zongxue thought that Jing Yuelan went to smash Gu Ning’s stores because Gu Ning had helped her out last time, so she felt very guilty.

Therefore, at their gathering, Baili Zongxue apologized to her. “Gu Ning, I’m sorry. It’s all my fault. If it hadn’t been for me, you wouldn’t have messed with Jing Yuelan and Jing Yuelan wouldn’t have smashed your stores…”

“What happened?” Song Miaoge and Zhang Zikai asked Baili Zongxue, but they didn’t blame her.

“Oh, it’s not because of that, it was because of something else,” Gu Ning immediately said to comfort her.

Even though Gu Ning said that, Baili Zongxue couldn’t believe it, so Gu Ning asked, “Have you heard about what happened to the Jing family yet?”

“The Jing family? I’ve heard about it, but I don’t know any details,” said Baili Zongxue. She only knew that Jing Yunyao went to take revenge and Jing Yaorong’s family was chased out of the Jing family, then Senior Mrs. Jing died.

However, Baili Zongxue didn’t know that Shangguan Yang and his disciples were involved, so she had no idea that Gu Ning played a role in it.

In fact, when she heard about it, she had been surprised to know that Jing Yunyao was still alive!

Because she knew Jing Yunyao’s “death” had something to do with Jing Yaorong, she didn’t think it was wrong for Jing Yunyao to return to take revenge and disable Jing Yaorong, even though Jing Yaorong was her biological father.

Jing Yaorong had tried to kill Jing Yunyao, so it was already very nice of Jing Yunyao that she only made Jing Yaorong pay a small price. If Jing Yaorong wasn’t Jing Yunyao’s father, she would probably have made him pay a higher price.

“I went to the Jing family along with my master,” said Gu Ning, but she didn’t give many details.

“Oh!” Hearing that, Baili Zongxue didn’t feel guilty any longer. She didn’t ask for details either, because it was the Jing family’s family affair.

“What are you talking about? We can barely understand,” asked Song Miaoge.

“It’s another family’s personal affair so we can’t tell you much about it. But don’t worry, they’ll compensate me for the loss,” said Gu Ning. She couldn’t tell Song Miaoge and Zhang Zikai much about the cultivation world.

Since she said that Song Miaoge and Zhang Zikai stopped asking.
