Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

‘Who are you? How do you know Pei Heran?’ the elder woman asked, suspecting that they might be wealthy young ladies. If they were, offending them wouldn’t be beneficial to her.

“It’s none of your business!?” An Chenmeng retorted.

“You…” The elder woman was furious, but she didn’t dare to act rashly until she figured out their identities.

The young woman, however, felt that these people knew Pei Heran, but only in passing. So she said, “You don’t even know Heran! You’re just acting.”

An Chenmeng and the others rolled their eyes. Xiong Manxin said, “Do we need to act with you? Who are you? If you’re Heran’s fiancée, I have to question his taste. With so many young ladies with good character, family background and looks, he chose someone like you who bites people all around and has no manners.”

Regardless of whether this woman was Pei Heran’s fiancée or not, Xiong Manxin didn’t care about her face.

The woman used the Pei family’s influence to show off her power, but she was probably not a person of great importance herself.

“You…” The woman was so angry that she had an impulse to hit someone. However, there were too many people in Leng Xiaoyao’s group, and she was afraid that she wouldn’t be able to fight back. As a result, she tried hard to control her impulse.

At that moment, the store manager came back from outside and was shocked to see what was happening inside. He quickly went to see what was going on. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Miss An, Miss Xiong, what’s going on here?”

The manager recognized An Chenmeng and Xiong Manxin because they had come to this store with their mother several times before.

Seeing the manager being so polite to them, the salesperson, who had blocked their way earlier, became flustered.

Damn it!

The mother and daughter also realized that these girls’ backgrounds weren’t simple.

“Manager, you came just in time. This saleswoman stopped us and wouldn’t let us in, saying we couldn’t afford it. Then these two women said we’re just here to hook up with rich men. Do you think we look like we’re here to hook up with rich men?” An Chenmeng said.

The manager was taken aback and said, “How could Miss An and Miss Xiong not be able to afford it! Your mothers are our SVIP members! The An family and the Xiong family are both wealthy families in City Chang. Few could match your wealth in City Chang! ‘

Upon hearing that, the saleswoman and the mother and daughter were all stunned.

The An family, and the Xiong family?

The two families were definitely wealthy families! How could they not afford it? How could they be hooking up with rich men? It should be the other way around!

The saleswoman quickly realized her mistake and apologized. “I’m sorry, Miss

An and Miss Xiong. I failed to recognize you. Please forgive me this time.”

Luxury brand stores actually had strict rules. If a salesperson offended a customer, he or she might get their salary deducted or even get fired.

The wages of luxury brand stores were much higher than those of ordinary brand stores.

People who worked in luxury brand stores often had a sense of superiority, so there were often incidents of looking down on customers. Some customers made a scene, while others didn’t.

This salesperson had looked down on customers before, but this time she met her match.

An Chenmeng continued. “I’m not that forgiving to forgive someone who made me angry. I need answers today.” She wasn’t weak and was only tolerant in front of Leng Xiaoyao. Even her parents didn’t receive that treatment!

The manager didn’t dare plead for the salesperson and simply said, “Go settle your salary and leave!”

He had reminded them more than once to treat all customers politely, regardless of whether they could afford to buy or not.

However, the salesperson had gone against this advice.

If the customer hadn’t pursued the matter, she wouldn’t have been fired, but since the customer did pursue it, the manager wouldn’t cover for her.

After all, she had been warned multiple times.

The manager didn’t need to offend these wealthy customers for the sake of the employees.

“Manager, I know I was wrong. Please don’t fire me.” The salesperson cried. Unfortunately, no one sympathized with her because this wasn’t the first time she had behaved this way.

Although Leng Xiaoyao thought the punishment was a bit severe, she realized that if she had an employee like this, she would have fired them without hesitation.

Therefore, she didn’t think it was too much.

After failing to get the manager and An Chenmeng to change their minds, the salesperson reluctantly collected her salary and left.

However, she harbored hatred towards the manager and An Chenmeng, thinking that it was their fault that she was fired.

However, her hatred was useless. She was just an ordinary person who couldn’t do anything to them.

The mother and daughter didn’t say anything either and left quietly.

“I don’t think that woman is really Heran’s fiancée. If she were, she wouldn’t be so scared,” said Xiong Manxin.

“She’s not. She was too nervous just now,” said An Chenmeng.

Nevertheless, they didn’t keep bothering the mother and daughter.

“Little Panda, you call Pei Heran brother even though he’s your younger uncle’s friend. Your status seems a bit confused!” Leng Xiaoyao teased Xiong Manxin.

‘Well, he’s only a few years older than me. I can’t call him uncle, can l? Then he would be taking advantage of me!” Xiong Manxin replied, refusing to use the title her younger uncle had also suggested.

The other girls also laughed and teased Xiong Manxin.

Leng Xiaoyao had the salesperson get the clothes from the model in a size which would fit someone who was 185 cm, which was similar to Li Mochan ‘s height.

Then she picked out clothes for Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng.

“Boss, weren’t you only buying for your grandpa and third uncle? Why did you buy three items? Tell us, who’s the third one for?” An Chenmeng asked playfully, sensing some gossip.

The three items were all different sizes. If two of them were the same size, they wouldn’t think it was for three people.

“I guess it’s for Mr. Li!’ guessed Xiong Manxin, thinking that Leng Xiaoyao’s relationship with Li Mochan was different. However, it was just a wild guess. “Right, it’s for him.” Leng Xiaoyao admitted without feeling embarrassed or awkward.

‘Wow! Boss, are you and Mr. Li together?” Wu Minmin immediately asked. Although she had only seen Li Mochan once at the MO family’s event, he was the most handsome and charismatic man she had ever seen..
