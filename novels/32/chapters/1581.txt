Chapter 1584: Take Him as Your Apprentice

The old man had no intention to hurt Gu Ning, and he simply wanted the roasted chicken, so Leng Shaoting felt relieved and walked back to Gu Ning’s side.

“It’s mine. Why should I give it to you?” Gu Ning said.

Although both Leng Shaoting and her weren’t a match for this old man, she wouldn’t grin and bear it. In addition, Gu Ning didn’t feel any unkindness from this man, so she was in the mood to joke with him.

“How will you be willing to give it to me?” The old man frowned.

“Tell me who you’re,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, the old man looked confused. “I don’t know.”

Gu Ning was surprised, but she figured it out quickly.

This old man had stayed in the tower for hundreds of years, so he had probably lost his memories.

Actually, it wasn’t really important if he didn’t remember who he was, and Gu Ning didn’t care much about it either. She was simply curious about him.

“Hey, I already answered your question. Where is the chicken?” The old man was impatient.

He urged Gu Ning to give him the roasted chicken when Gu Ning still hid it away from him.

“I didn’t agree to give it to you even though you answered my question.” Gu Ning blinked at the old man and looked innocent.

“You...” The old man was angry, so Leng Shaoting stayed alert, in case he suddenly attacked Gu Ning. However, the old man didn’t do that, but glared at Gu Ning. “What do you want?”

“Take him as your apprentice, and teach him your secret kung fu skills,” Gu Ning said, pointing at Leng Shaoting.

Even though Gu Ning made that decision without asking for Leng Shaoting’s permission beforehand, she knew that he needed a kung fu master to help him.

“What?” Both the old man and Leng Shaoting were surprised.

Leng Shaoting didn’t disagree, because he indeed needed a kung fu master to teach him. In fact, he felt touched that Gu Ning was so considerate.

Gu Ning also observed Leng Shaoting’s reaction when she said that, and relaxed when he wasn’t annoyed. Even though she said it for his good, she made the decision without his permission after all.

Luckily, Leng Shaoting had the same idea as her.

The old man sized up Leng Shaoting for a while, then showed satisfaction on his face. “He’s a talented cultivator that could accept different strong energies and go up three levels at a time. It’s rare to see something like that, but...”

He didn’t witness what had happened to Leng Shaoting earlier, but he could feel the change in Leng Shaoting’s body.

“But what?”

Gu Ning frowned and got nervous.

“I don’t like to have apprentices. It’s troublesome, and I’m free by myself,” the old man said.

Hearing that, Gu Ning sneered. To her surprise, the old man rejected to take Leng Shaoting as his apprentice because he was afraid of trouble.

“Do you want the roasted chicken or not?” Gu Ning asked.

The old man’s eyes lit up at once when he heard roasted chicken, but he looked unhappy the second he thought that he had to take Leng Shaoting as his apprentice.

“You must have stayed in the tower for ages, right?” Gu Ning said.

“Yeah,” said the old man.

“Well, there are countless delicious foods in our world, and a roasted chicken is nothing,” Gu Ning said.

The old man couldn’t stand the temptation and stopped Gu Ning at once. “Alright, alright, stop making my mouth water now.”

“Don’t you want to try the delicious foods that you’ve never tasted before?” Gu Ning said.

It was impossible for the old man to refuse to try the delicious foods he always wanted to eat. There were rare delicious foods that he couldn’t have at Kunlun Mountain. Although he was a very senior cultivator and he could live without eating much, it didn’t mean that he lost his appetite for delicious food. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“In addition to delicious foods, we have many more good drinks,” Gu Ning continued.

“No, no, stop there!” The old man covered his ears with his hands.

“Come on, it’s not as troublesome as you think to have an apprentice. He won’t stay with you every day, and will just come to visit you and learn kung fu skills from you sometimes,” Gu Ning said.

“Really?” The old man was attracted to Gu Ning’s advice.

“Sure, you can also leave with me, because it’s not easy for us to come here once and you can enjoy the countless delicious foods and good drinks in our world,” Gu Ning said.

She kept persuading the old man.

If the old man was willing to go to their world more often, it would be more convenient for Leng Shaoting to learn secret kung fu skills from him.
