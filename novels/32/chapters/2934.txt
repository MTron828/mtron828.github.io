2935 It’s a Mistake

However, it was useless, because no one would believe it and it would only make him appear guiltier.

Wei Youwei was restless as he walked around in his office, but he had no idea what to do. Tang Yunhang, at the same time, went straight to the office of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.

Afterwards, Tang Yunhang handed the evidence to his people at the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.

It was necessary, because other people might not do their best to help him with the investigation.

When Tang Yunhang’s people saw the evidence, they were surprised too. They knew Wei Youwei was a corrupt official, but they could never find evidence. Now there was solid proof, and it was even written down by Wei Youwei himself.

They could finally take action!

Without delay, they went to see Wei Youwei.

When Wei Youwei saw them, he was still in a panic.

He wanted to resist, but didn’t know how, so he had to follow them back home.

After searching and checking, the video was indeed taken at Wei Youwei’s home. After the bookshelves were moved away, there was indeed a hole hidden under the floor, but the stuff inside was already gone.

Wei Youwei couldn’t figure out how his notebooks were found and stolen. After all, he had no idea when it happened.

If it really had something to do with the broken lock this morning, how did the person move the large bookshelves away without making any sounds?

It was impossible for a person to do alone.

If there had been many people who broke into his home, his family should have heard something! Were they drugged beforehand?

Thinking of that, Wei Youwei thought it must be the answer, otherwise they should have heard something!

“Secretary Wei, what do you want to say right now?” an employee working in the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection asked.

Wei Youwei remained silent, but it only proved that he knew that he was guilty. If not, he would defend himself.

“Secretary Wei, please go to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection with us right now.” Because Wei Youwei refused to say anything, there was no need for them to waste time asking him. They could directly take him back for interrogation.

Wei Youwei didn’t resist, because it was meaningless.

When the staff of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection took Wei Youwei out, his wife saw them and was scared. She immediately asked them what happened.

An employee told her the reason, leaving her shocked and scared. She couldn’t believe her ears.

It turned out that Wei Youwei’s wife had no idea what he had done, so she refused to believe it was true.

“No, that’s impossible. It’s impossible. It must be a mistake!” Wei Youwei’s wife exclaimed.

“Mrs. Wei, we have solid proof to prove he’s guilty. It can’t be a mistake,” the staff replied.

“No, no, I don’t believe it.” Mrs. Wei still couldn’t believe it. Looking at Wei Youwei, she wanted to ask him for an answer, but Wei Youwei said nothing. All of a sudden, she realized it could be true.

In the end, Wei Youwei was taken away.

The next day, the news quickly went abroad, and everyone was surprised.

A few days later, the result was out. Wei Youwei was punished according to the law. Because there was solid proof, Wei Youwei had to yield, but once he admitted it, many people were in trouble too, because he wasn’t the only person who accepted bribes.

Afterwards, nothing else happened and they lived a peaceful life again. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s wedding was around the corner and would be held in two weeks.

Therefore, Gu Ning returned to the capital, because she needed to do some things in person.

She had to write the invitation letters to her friends because only she knew who she was going to invite.

One day, Gu Ning suddenly received Bai Xueyan’s call. Bai Xueyan was also in the capital and wanted to have a meal with her.

They hadn’t met for a long time, but they kept in touch through WeChat and calls, so they weren’t strangers.

Since Bai Xueyan was in the capital and Gu Ning was free now, Gu Ning agreed to dine with her.

By now Bai Xueyan was a lot more mature, but she still loved Allan. Every time Bai Xueyan called Gu Ning, she talked about Allan.

Bai Xueyan and Allan were still friends. Although they were closer than before, they were just friends. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

At her meeting with Gu Ning this time, she couldn’t help talking about Allan again.

“Gu Ning, am I helpless in love? I clearly know that he won’t accept me, but I can’t forget him. It’s been several years,” Bai Xueyan said in a sad tone.

“I can’t give you any opinion on that. You can just follow your heart!” Gu Ning replied. In fact, Gu Ning knew that Allan had already fallen in love with Bai Xueyan, because she had asked him face to face once, but due to their age gap, he had no idea how to get along with Bai Xueyan romantically.

“Although I truly love him and badly want to be together with him, I’m really tired now. Perhaps I should give up,” Bai Xueyan said. She had thought about it for a long while, but now might be the time for her to make the decision.

“You can’t, right? Why don’t you have a talk with him?” Gu Ning said. Allan told Gu Ning not to tell Bai Xueyan that he was already in love with her, so Gu Ning had to keep it a secret.

“I’m afraid that he’ll only hate me if I talk about it again,” Bai Xueyan explained. Even if she gave up the idea of becoming Allan’s girlfriend, she still couldn’t leave him. She still wanted to be his friend.

“If he hates you, he wouldn’t be friends with you,” Gu Ning said

“Fine, I guess I really should talk to him.” Bai Xueyan didn’t want to live in regret, so she made up her mind to give it a try.

She wasn’t timid, otherwise she wouldn’t have chased Allan.

After the meal, Gu Ning sent Bai Xueyan to the hotel before going home.
