Chapter 2157: It Takes Two to Tango

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Yes, I mean it.” Huang Zhenlang put on a sincere look, and Zhou Wei temporarily believed him.

“Alright, I trust you,” said Zhou Wei.

After that, they left together.

After the two left, Gu Ning walked out of the dark, holding a phone in her hand.

What happened just now was recorded by Gu Ning. It wasn’t that she was nosy, but she had a premonition that something bad might happen later.

Zhou Wei was guilty of being cheap and intervening in another woman’s family, so no matter what happened in the end, she deserved it. However, she couldn’t just ignore the person who caused this bad consequence, that was, Huang Zhenlang.

After all, it took two to tango. This man called Huang Zhenlang clearly had a family, but he still went to hook up with a female student, which was equally damning. Moreover, as a teacher of the Capital University, it was against others’ expectations that he did such a morally corrupt thing.

Given Huang Zhenlang’s reaction just now, he might attack Zhou Wei for his own future, but Gu Ning didn’t know whether he would only attack the baby in Zhou Wei’s belly or Zhou Wei as well. If he decided to harm Zhou Wei, would he injure or kill her?

Gu Ning wouldn’t interfere if it was only for the baby, but if it was for Zhou Wei and the situation became serious, she wouldn’t be able to sit on the sidelines.

Shortly after Huang Zhenlang and Zhou Wei left, Gu Ning also left. It was late, and it wouldn’t be good if she returned to the dormitory too late. Therefore, she would deal with the female water ghost later. Anyway, Qu Hanjiao was fine for the time being.

The female ghost in the water also saw the scene of Huang Zhenlang and Zhou Wei. She, no, it got emotional right away, and couldn’t wait to kill.

It was so familiar! It used to be fooled like this, but the man it used to date had no family. That man killed it for power, so it ached to kill him for revenge!

Now it finally had a chance, but unexpectedly Gu Ning appeared and damaged its plan.

It knew the girl wouldn’t give up, so they would soon meet again. However, it was reluctant, so reluctant to wait for longer.

…

When Gu Ning returned to the dormitory, it was nearly 11 pm.

Because Gu Ning told her roommates that she would come back late in the evening and she needed to deal with something, Song Miaoge and Zhang Zikai didn’t ask her any questions when she was back.

Baili Zongxue knew where Gu Ning went. Although she wanted to know whether Gu Ning had found out anything useful, it obviously wasn’t the right time to do that. Therefore, she could only ask Gu Ning on WeChat when they were about to sleep.

Baili Zongxue: Gu Ning, did you find anything useful?

Because it was Baili Zongxue, Gu Ning didn’t bother to keep it a secret from her.

Gu Ning: Qu Hanjiao is nourishing a ghost. At the end of Future Lake, there is a female water ghost. Qu Hanjiao is dripping three drops of blood every day for it. After forty-nine days, the female water ghost will be able to possess Qu Hanjiao.

Reading that, Baili Zongxue was surprised and displeased. It was beyond her expectations.

Baili Zongxue: What’s Qu Hanjiao’s purpose?

Gu Ning: No idea for now, but I think she’ll pay me back if she really succeeds.

Gu Ning was very sure of it because Qu Hanjiao hated her very much.

Baili Zongxue: If so, it’ll be a total waste of her effort. Anyway, the female ghost must aim to take revenge too by doing that.

Qu Hanjiao was no match for Gu Ning, so she was doomed to fail.

Gu Ning: It can’t be obvious, because it can only live forty-nine days after it succeeds.

Baili Zongxue: What’s your plan then? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Gu Ning: Ghosts aren’t allowed to stay in the mortal world. Since I met it, I should remove it from our world. However, if I directly beat it to ashes, it’s also detrimental to my yin virtue, so I’ll first eliminate its obsession and let it fall into reincarnation by itself!

Baili Zongxue: I agree. I know you can deal with it, but feel free to let me know if you need me.

Baili Zongxue really wanted to help, but only when Gu Ning needed her.

Gu Ning: Sure.

Their chat ended here.

The next day, right after their classes were over at noon, Gu Ning received Jing Yunfei’s call. He asked her whether she was free. If she was, he hoped they could have a private talk.

Even if Gu Ning was going to talk about business with Jing Yunfei, she wouldn’t let him succeed easily, so she replied that she wasn’t free.

Jing Yunfei asked her whether she was free in the afternoon, but Gu Ning turned him down once more.

Jing Yunfei was a little mad and felt that Gu Ning didn’t want to see him. However, no matter how displeased he was right now, he couldn’t argue with Gu Ning, so he asked her when she was free.

Gu Ning said that she would see tomorrow and she would try to squeeze in some time to see him.

Since she said that, Jing Yunfei could only wait.

When Gu Ning and her roommates were dining in the canteen, Gu Ning looked around once in a while during the meal.

“Gu Ning, whom are you looking for?” Song Miaoge asked confusedly.

“Oh, nothing, I just casually looked around,” said Gu Ning.

“Oh!” Song Miaoge stopped asking further about that.

Baili Zongxue, however, knew that Gu Ning was looking for Qu Hanjiao.

Halfway through the meal, Gu Ning saw Qu Hanjiao in the corner. She still had that gloomy expression, but this time, she didn’t see Gu Ning.

After eating, they went for a walk in the grove. At this time, Gu Ning’s phone rang and it was Leng Shaoting. Gu Ning told her roommates that she needed to answer the call and walked aside.

Once Gu Ning walked away, they began to discuss it.

“Hey, is it her fiancé? Oh, I feel a little envious of her,” said Song Miaoge, seeming hit heavily.

“Don’t be jealous. Get yourself a boyfriend,” said Zhang Zikai.

“It’s not that easy. Anyway, even if I’m going to have a boyfriend, I won’t date our schoolmates. They’re just boys. I like mature men,” said Song Miaoge.

“Do you think you’re mature and stable?” Zhang Zikai asked with disdain.

“I don’t care. I just want a mature and stable man,” said Song Miaoge with determination.

“Mature men don’t prefer little girls because they need girlfriends instead of daughters. They prefer mature, elegant women. Take Gu Ning as an example, she’s young, but she behaves much more maturely than people in their thirties,” said Zhang Zikai.

Not all the mature, stable men preferred mature, elegant women, but most of them did, because people were very realistic nowadays.

“Stop upsetting me!” Song Miaoge was so mad that she felt she could hardly breathe.

“I can’t. It’s so enjoyable,” said Zhang Zikai sincerely.

“Zhang Zikai, what did you say?” Song Miaoge angrily asked and began to playfully chase and fight with Zhang Zikai.
