Chapter 1507: Let’s See the Construction Site

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning remembered what had happened at the abandoned building in City B last time, and believed that there must be ghosts who were causing trouble.

After looking at its pictures and location, Gu Ning was very satisfied with it. Therefore, she decided to go see it.

The third place Chen Cangyi found was also a good place, but it was very close to the first place. Even if Gu Ning was going to buy it, she wouldn’t build a hotel on it, because it wasn’t a smart decision to build two hotels which were so close to each other at the same time.

Quality was more important than quantity when it came to luxurious hotels. Therefore, Gu Ning planned to buy it first and leave it there till she needed to use it in the future.

Chen Cangyi showed her more places, but Gu Ning wasn’t very interested in them. She didn’t need too many pieces of land right now, so it would be a total waste of money if she bought too many pieces of land at once.

Most of the pieces of good land were held by the government waiting for a high bid, so it wasn’t easy for Chen Cangyi to find them.

“You can prepare to buy the first and third land, and I’ll go to see the second land before I make a decision,” Gu Ning said.

Although she had suspicions that the trouble was caused by ghosts, she wasn’t 100% sure of it. If there was a serious problem she couldn’t deal with, she wouldn’t buy the second land.

As for the first and third land, Gu Ning trusted Chen Cangyi, and believed that he could handle it well. Chen Cangyi was a very outstanding manager, and could manage the company well on behalf of Gu Ning.

After that, Gu Ning had to have a talk with An Guangyao.

An Guangyao was the senior manager of Gu Ning’s real estate company, so he should be doing this work for Gu Ning. However, An Guangyao’s ambit was limited in Province D, and he didn’t have many connections in the capital, so it would be difficult for him to deal with it.

Anyway, both Chen Cangyi and An Guangyao were working for her, and she would assign the job to either of them when they were able to deal with it.

Gu Ning had no intention to open a real estate company in the capital for the time being, because she didn’t have a good chance yet. Even though Shenghua Real Estate was quite famous and important in Province D, it wasn’t comparable to the real estate companies in the capital. In addition, she could make a lot outside of the capital too, and Shenghua Real Estate needed more time for better development.

When Shenghua Real Estate became the leading company in the real estate industry in Province D, she would have confidence to enter the market in the capital.

“No problem,” Chen Cangyi said.

Actually, Chen Cangyi had doubts about the unlucky construction site, but he didn’t ask further about it. Because Gu Ning had acquired a haunted construction site in City B once before and nothing strange ever happened again, Chen Cangyi believed that she could solve this problem.

It was also the reason why he placed the second land among the choices even though he heard that it was an unlucky place.

In his eyes, Gu Ning was really incredible, but he knew that he shouldn’t ask her about something he shouldn’t know.

After that, Gu Ning left. She knew that Wu Shunhua was still spying on her, so she told K to drive her.

Gu Ning, Gao Yi, and Qiao Ya sat on the rear seats of the car and successfully avoided Wu Shunhua.

Gu Ning went there along with Gao Yi and Qiao Ya in order to fill them in on some secrets. Both Gao Yi and Qiao Ya were mentally stronger than ordinary people, so she wasn’t worried that they would be scared.

They left for the eastern district from the southern district, which took them over 40 minutes on the road.

There was a circle of blue iron sheets around the construction site to stop people from walking inside. Gao Yi stopped the car at the gate of the construction site, and noticed that the iron gate was open.

Seeing that, Gu Ning frowned with dissatisfaction. Since this place was unlucky, the door should be closed tightly. What if someone accidentally got inside and had an accident?

Thinking of that, Gu Ning opened the car door and walked to the gate. When she was about to enter the construction site, she saw a boy stumbling over in tears. At the same time, Gu Ning noticed a flow of black smoke circling above the center of the construction site. It wasn’t thick, nor thin.

Only Gu Ning was able to see it.

Something terrible must have happened, and the boy was scared by it.

Gu Ning took out several power crystals right away, and told Gao Yi and Qiao Ya to take a pill before they walked inside. After that, she walked towards the young boy.

“Please help! Help my older brother Xiaolin!” the young boy shouted to Gu Ning once he saw her.

Saying that, he stumbled onto the ground. Gu Ning helped him get back to his feet at once, then asked, “What happened?”

“My older brother Xiaolin just fell into a pit, and he is unconscious now. Nobody can wake him up,” the young boy cried in fear.

Hearing that, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see the center of the construction site.

With a simple glance, she saw another young boy lying in the pit that the coffin was dug out of, and he was covered by Yin now. Because of the Yin, the young boy’s face was turning pale.

“Qiao Ya, you can wait outside with this boy, and Gao Yi will go inside with me,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure.” They nodded.

The young boy was too scared to think about whether they were good people or not, he only hoped that his older brother would be fine.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
