Chapter 1488: We’re Not Friends

Shen Baixiang knew that Xu Qinyin was avoiding him. Maybe it was because he had hurt her before and she hated him now, or because she disdained him now, but either way, he was unwilling to give up. As long as he could marry into the Xu family, he would have a bright future.

“I’m sorry, I don’t think that we’re close at all. We’ve only met each other several times,” Xu Qinyin said after losing her patience.

It was true that they seldom saw each other during these years. When they were back in the school, Xu Qinyin had only met him three times, and she quietly admired him from afar most of the time. After their graduation, they barely saw one another.

However, Shen Baixiang had the idea to coincidentally meet Xu Qinyin once he found out about her real family background.

Although Xu Qinyin didn’t have evidence to prove that Shen Baixiang approached her on purpose recently, she was very sure that he was calculating. He had rejected her before, but suddenly acted so kind towards her, which was quite abnormal. They didn’t keep in touch after all.

“Xu Qinyin, stop acting! We all know that you confessed your love to Baixiang before. Don’t you think that you’re hypocritical?” Luo Xueshan was mad.

Even though Luo Xueshan hated it when Shen Baixiang stood near to Xu Qinyin, she disliked it when Xu Qinyin embarrassed Shen Baixiang too. In Luo Xueshan’s eyes, Shen Baixiang was her prince, and she wouldn’t allow anyone to humiliate him.

However, Xu Qinyin had a totally different opinion about Shen Baixiang and she thought that he always despised the poor and curried favor with the rich. If Shen Baixiang didn’t know that her family was the Xu family in the capital, he wouldn’t be eager to please her. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Xueshan, don’t say that!” Shen Baixiang stopped Luo Xueshan right away and turned to explain it to Xu Qinyin. “Qinyin, please don’t mind. Xueshan didn’t mean it.”

Luo Xueshan was furious when she saw Shen Baixiang explaining it to Xu Qinyin with a smile.

“Baixiang, I...” Luo Xueshan tried to defend herself, but Shen Baixiang gave her a glance of warning.

“Well.” Xu Qinyin felt it was quite ironic.

“Xueshan, I think it’s necessary for me to explain it to you right now. I admit that I’ve confessed my affection towards Baixiang before, but it doesn’t mean that I’m familiar with him. I have only met him several times till now, and I believe that many girls in our school have admired him from afar. After my graduation, I barely saw Baixiang, and gradually forgot about him. To be honest with you, we’re not even friends.”

“You...” Luo Xueshan felt embarrassed and didn’t know what to say now.

Shen Baixiang was angry too, but didn’t dare to vent his anger on Xu Qinyin.

“Baixiang, we’re simply alumni at the most, so please don’t tell other people that we’re familiar with each other, because it may cause misunderstandings. If you don’t mind, we can regard each other as strangers,” Xu Qinyin said.

Xu Qinyin understood that Luo Xueshan admired Shen Baixiang and that she was attacking her because of him.

Actually, she always wanted to find a good reason to get rid of Shen Baixiang. She was a member of the Xu family anyway, and she had to take her family’s reputation into consideration when she did anything. Now she got a good chance and didn’t want to miss it.

“Qinyin, it’s not like that. Xueshan and I...” Shen Baixiang was anxious. He couldn’t wait to prove that there was nothing special between Luo Xuehan and him. Unfortunately, he only made the situation more complicated. The more eager he was to try to clear his relationship with Luo Xueshan, the more misunderstandings he caused.

“Enough, I don’t want to hear it. I’m an adult, not a kid and I know what’s happening. Alright, I should go now,” Xu Qinyin said and was unwilling to let Shen Baixiang finish. After that, she walked into Song Nan’s bar.

“Qinyin!” Shen Baixiang wanted to stop her, but was afraid that he might annoy her, so he gave up.

However, he was full of anger now. He felt embarrassed because Xu Qinyin didn’t care about his dignity.

Even though Shen Baixiang still wanted to chase Xu Qinyin, it didn’t mean that he was tolerant and would respect her. He was only hiding his true colors.
