870 Xu Jinlin“s Apology

When he was in his room, Xu Jinlin thought for a while, then called Xu Jinchen. Gu Ning had told him not to flirt with her or he would be regretful, so he was afraid that his younger brother, Xu Jinchen, liked her.

At this time, Xu Jinchen was on the way out of their military base along with Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei.

Leng Shaoting was going to HK tonight to be with Gu Ning, so he finished everything he needed to do today.

Right after Leng Shaoting told Xin Bei to drive to the airport, but before he could even ask Leng Shaoting where was he leaving for, Xu Jinchen received Xu Jinlin’s call.

“Jinchen, I just met a very beautiful girl around 18 years old in the elevator. She looked surprised when she saw me. I asked her whether she knew me, and she said that I resembled one of her friends. I joked a little with her, then she told me that you’re her friend. Do you know who she is?” Xu Jinlin asked, feeling slightly uneasy.

Hearing that, Xu Jinchen though of Gu Ning at once, because Gu Ning was the only girl who was very beautiful and about 18 years old that he knew.

Leng Shaoting also heard their conversation, and Gu Ning’s name dawned on him too. He frowned, but wasn’t annoyed.

“A very beautiful girl around 18? She must be Gu Ning. Aren’t you in HK now? Is Gu Ning also in HK?” Xu Jinchen asked.

“Gu Ning? The name sounds familiar. What’s your relationship with her?” Xu Jinlin asked.

No matter what their relationship was, he hoped that they weren’t a couple, or he would be utterly embarrassed.

“Gu Ning is Shaoting’s girlfriend,” Xu Jinchen said.

“What?” Hearing that, Xu Jinlin was shocked.

If Shaoting knows that I’ve flirted with his girlfriend... Xu Jinlin felt scared. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Xu Jinchen thought that Xu Jinlin was just shocked to find out the fact that Gu Ning was Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend, so he thought that his reaction was quite normal. In addition, he realized that Leng Shaoting was leaving for HK now.

“Hey, boss, are you going to HK now?” Xu Jinchen still asked to make sure that he was right.

“Yeah,” Leng Shaoting said.

At the other side of the phone, Xu Jinlin’s hand trembled in fear when he heard Leng Shaoting’s voice, and his phone almost fell on the floor. He didn’t know that Leng Shaoting was by Xu Jinchen’s side, and he regretted that he had called.

In fact, Leng Shaoting wouldn’t do anything to hurt him even if he found out. He would tell Xu Jinchen to practice fighting skills with him at the most. It wasn’t a bad thing, but it didn’t mean that he liked it.

Although he didn’t serve in the army, he, as a key member in an influential family, was in a much more dangerous situation than normal people, so he needed to learn and practice martial arts. However, he was still barely comparable to Xu Jinchen who was a professional soldier. Besides, with Leng Shaoting’s order, Xu Jinchen wouldn’t treat him gently. He would probably have to lie in bed for a couple of days! It had happened before, and it left a mental scar on him.

“Um, I gotta go, bye.” Xu Jinlin hung up at once, then released a long breath.

The moment he hung up, his phone rang again, which scared him. He thought that it was Xu Jinchen calling, but the caller turned out to be Gong Zehan.

If others saw him, the heir of the Xu family, behaving like that, they would be amused and laugh at him, but there was nothing he could do about it. He only hoped that Gu Ning wouldn’t complain to Leng Shaoting, or he would be punished without a doubt.

...

Gu Ning took a shower and changed her clothing before she went to the dining hall when it was almost 6 pm.

Coincidentally, she ran into Xu Jinlin again in the elevator, and Gong Zehan was there as well.

Xu Jinlin was struck dumb for a second after seeing Gu Ning, then panicked a little.

Gu Ning smiled at him, but said nothing. Gong Zehan, on the other hand, was confused by them.

“Um, Miss Gu, I’m so sorry for what I did. Please don’t complain about it to Shaoting. I swear I had no intention to do anything to you,” Xu Jinlin said, in case Leng Shaoting punished him.

Although Xu Jinlin was the heir of the Xu family, he was totally different from those arrogant young men who were also born in super-rich families. He was very easy-going and kind to his family members and friends. When he faced strangers, he was cold and stayed aloof, but he was like a cunning fox in front of his enemies.

Gu Ning was a stranger too, but she was Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend, so she was also his friend to some extent. There was no need for him to purposely keep a distance from her.

Gong Zehan was surprised to hear that. He was curious, but it was obviously not a good time to ask Xu Jinlin now.

“Of course I won’t. It’s not a big deal, but why are you so afraid of him?” Gu Ning asked with a smile. She wasn’t surprised that Xu Jinlin knew about her relationship with Leng Shaoting. He must have asked Xu Jinchen.

Xu Jinlin was relieved when Gu Ning forgave him, but he felt a little embarrassed hearing her question. “Um, I’m not afraid of him, but we’re close brothers! I don’t want to annoy him.” He sounded serious.

Gu Ning just smiled, but said nothing.

Afterwards, Xu Jinlin suddenly saw Gao Yi and Qiao Ya standing behind Gu Ning. He recognized them at once, and was surprised again.
