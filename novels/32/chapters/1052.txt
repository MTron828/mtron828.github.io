Chapter 1053 Master Leng“s Gift for the First Formal Meeting

“Relax, grandpa, Gu Ning didn’t agree, nor did Shaoting, so General Peng gave up,” Leng Shaoxun said.

Hearing that, Master Leng was relieved.

Since Peng Yunlong already gave the idea up, he wouldn’t bother to talk to him in person about it.

...

Once Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were in the house, Leng Shaoting pressed her against the wall and kissed her with great passion.

He hadn’t seen Gu Ning for days, and missed her so much.

“Ningning, I missed you.” Leng Shaoting’s husky voice sounded by Gu Ning’s ears.

“Shaoting, I missed you too,” Gu Ning said.

At this moment, the video of the fighting competition between Gu Ning and Peng Yunlong was uploaded to the Internet, and went viral.

Although the person who uploaded the video didn’t know them, some people recognized their faces.

The girl was the famous Goddess Gu, while the man was General Peng.

Peng Yunlong sometimes showed up on TV, so his face wasn’t strange to many people.

Everyone was shocked that Gu Ning was able to make friends with Peng Yunlong, who was the general officer in the general military region of the capital.

It was obvious that they weren’t strangers.

At the end of the video, Peng Yunlong talked with Gu Ning in a relaxed manner, and people realized that they hadn’t really fought against each other, but just did it for fun.

Therefore, everyone thought that Gu Ning might be a friend of Peng Yunlong’s.

“Goddess Gu is so unbelievable! She can even make friends with General Peng.”

“She didn’t lose the fighting competition with General Peng either!”

...

It was almost 5 pm after Leng Shaoting took a shower and put on new clothes, and they left for the Leng family’s house.

Gu Ning wanted to prepare some gifts for the Leng family members before they went to visit them, since it was their first formal meeting.

Leng Shaoting had told her that he only cared about his grandfather, but Gu Ning should still obey the etiquette as Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend. If she didn’t bring gifts, the members of the Leng family might have a bad impression of her.

Leng Shaoting agreed with it in the end.

Actually, he had also prepared some good tea and drinks as gifts.

Gu Ning planned to buy something more herself, but Leng Shaoting said tea and drinks were enough, so Gu Ning gave the idea up.

Gu Ning had met Master Leng before, so she wasn’t nervous this time.

...

When they arrived at the Leng family’s house, it was 5:30 pm, and the kitchen was busy preparing dinner at the same time. Leng Yuanzhen, Leng Yuanqian and his wife were still at work now, so the dinner wouldn’t begin very soon.

Only Master Leng and Leng Shaoxun were in the Leng family’s house now.

Master Leng kept chatting with Gu Ning once she showed up, and ignored Leng Shaoting.

“Girl Gu, you don’t need to bring so many gifts!” Master Leng said, because he already accepted Gu Ning as a member of his family. In addition, Gu Ning had sent him many priceless gifts before.

He didn’t want her to spend too much money on gifts.

“Well, it’s our first formal meeting, and I should bring some gifts, or the others might think that I’m impolite,” Gu Ning said.

Master Leng laughed. “Alright, but don’t do it again the next time.”

“I won’t,” Gu Ning said.

After that, Master Leng took out a small and delicate box and handed it to Gu Ning. “Girl Gu, this is a little gift to you. It’s not as valuable as those gifts you’ve sent me. Please don’t be disappointed.”

“Of course I’m not! I love it, and thank you so much, grandpa,” Gu Ning said.

She took the box with a broad smile on her face. It was Master Leng’s gift to her at their first formal meeting, so there was no reason for her not to accept it.

Moreover, she had sent Master Leng many gifts before, and there was nothing wrong for her to accept a gift from him now.

Master Leng also beamed when Gu Ning said that she loved his gift.

He was happy to see Gu Ning accept it.

Gu Ning opened the small box, and there was a white jade bracelet inside. Although it looked ancient, it was covered in dense magical power.

“This is a family heirloom from the older generation of the Leng family, and it belonged to Shaoting’s grandmother. Although it’s not very expensive, it’s meaningful, so I’m giving it to you today, and I wish you and Shaoting a happy ending,” Master Leng said. This jade bracelet reminded him of his deceased wife.

“Grandpa, I promise I’ll take good care of it, and live a happy life with Shaoting,” Gu Ning said.

“Great, great.” Hearing that, Master Leng almost cried.

...

Leng Shaoxi came home from her school at 6 pm. She greeted Master Leng and Leng Shaoting when she saw them.

However, when Leng Shaoxi’s sight fell on Gu Ning, her eyes lit up at once. “A-Are you Goddess Gu?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Leng Shaoxi recognized Gu Ning, because she was Gu Ning’s fan too.

Leng Shaoxun was confused, and asked, “Goddess Gu? Do you mean Gu Ning?”

He hadn’t read much news about Gu Ning on the Internet, so he didn’t understand what Leng Shaoxi was talking about.
