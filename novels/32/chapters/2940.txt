2941 Don’t Say That

“Alright, we can use their helicopters to leave,” Leng Shaoting said. Since there were helicopters, there was no need to fly with a sword. Xu Jinchen and the others didn’t know that they had that ability, so they still wanted to keep it a secret.

After that, they went aboard the helicopter.

“Master, can I stay out for a while longer? I want to go on the helicopter too. I haven’t been on it before.” The tree vine begged Gu Ning.

“Alright!” Gu Ning responded. Because the helicopters could accommodate six people and the flood dragons and the monster fox were already put back into Gu Ning’s telepathic eye space, there was enough space for all of them.

Leng Shaoting flew the helicopter, because Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng were still weak and it was difficult to find the right direction.

“Wow, there is sand everywhere.” After the helicopter rose up into the air, the tree vine looked around and saw that there was only sand in his view.

He had seen a desert on TV before, but this was the first time that he had seen it in reality.

When they were on the ground back then, he didn’t pay much attention to it since his view was blocked by large stones.

“When I saw it on TV, I was amazed by how broad it is. Now that I saw it with my eyes. It looks even broader! I bet people can easily get lost walking in it!” The tree vine said, “I also want to see the sea. Master, can you let me out when you go to the sea in the future?”

“No problem,” Gu Ning replied.

“I feel as if he’s really a human. I can’t believe he’s actually…” Xu Jinchen said in surprise. He still needed time to digest this shocking news.

“Ever since he acquired the ability to turn into a boy, he has learned to surf on the Internet and read, so he knows a lot. He looks like an eight-year-old boy, but he knows a lot more than kids his age,” Gu Ning said.

“Will you send him to school?” Xu Jinchen asked.

“No, he’s a monster, and he needs to cultivate normally. He doesn’t have time to study and it’s useless for him anyway. He only needs to improve his level of cultivation. And he’ll be of great help in the future. I can raise him,” Gu Ning said.

“You’re right.” Xu Jinchen agreed.

Airplanes were faster than a flying sword, but helicopters were slower, so they didn’t reach the edge of the Demon City Desert until an hour later.

However, they didn’t stop right away. Instead, they flew as near as possible to City Feng, then landed where there was no one around. Afterwards, Gu Ning put the tree vine away in her telepathic eye space.

They then called Ai Weishun at once and asked him to fetch them.

Ai Weishun was resting in the Military General Hospital of City Feng since he needed to take care of the injured. They were worried about Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng’s safety the entire time, and they all thought that Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng might have been killed, so they were very upset.

They were close, so they would be heart-broken if any of them died, even though they were mentally-prepared to sacrifice at any time.

The moment Ai Weishun received Leng Shaoting’s call, he was excited to hear that both Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng had been rescued and were fine. He immediately drove to pick them up.

During this time, Gu Ning called Tang Yunfan and told him that she was safe.

Tang Yunfan had been also full of anxiety those two days, so he was finally relieved once he heard that Gu Ning was safe. After hanging up, he shared the good news with Tang Haifeng and the others. Everyone was happy to know that they were fine.

Leng Shaoting also called the Leng family and told them that he was fine.

Currently the sky had just turned dark as the second night after they came here started. That showed that they had been extremely efficient. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

It was normal, because they weren’t ordinary people. The three of them had magical power, and they had help from two flood dragons, a monster fox, and a tree vine. It would be a shame if they couldn’t finish the task within a couple of days.

Anyway, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s wedding could be held as planned.

Only they knew what Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng had been through. They didn’t tell the Xu family or Zhan Zhiyin, because they didn’t want to worry them.

Because there was a long distance between where they were right now and City Feng, Ai Weishun didn’t arrive until an hour later.

Once he arrived, he got out of the car and rushed to give Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng a big hug. He didn’t even have time to greet Leng Shaoting and the others. He could have lost his two close comrades, so he couldn’t wait to feel them with a big hug when he saw them again.

Ai Weishun even felt like crying and whimpered. “I’m so glad you’re fine. I thought you…”

He thought he wouldn’t see them again.

Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng whimpered too.

“Almost, we almost lost each other,” Chen Meng said. Thinking of what he had been through, Chen Meng was still scared. He wasn’t afraid of death, but he was reluctant to leave his comrades and family.

“Alright, we’re fine now,” Xu Jinchen said to comfort Ai Weishun and himself.

After they calmed down, Ai Weishun turned to Leng Shaoting and the others. “Hi, Shaoting, Aunt Yunyao, Gu Ning, thank you so much for your help.”

“Don’t say that. We’re brothers. Now let’s go back!” Leng Shaoting said, then they got in the car and left.

“How are they right now?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“They’re much better after taking the pills you gave them,” Ai Weishun replied. Leng Shaoting had given them Gu Ning’s power crystals.

“Great!” Leng Shaoting nodded. He understood that they would be fine after taking the power crystals, but he still needed to ask about their condition out of concern.

An hour later, they arrived at the Military General Hospital in City Feng and met the other members of the Red Flame. When the other teammates saw Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng, they were extremely excited.

They were much better now, but they were still injured, so Gu Ning gave them more power crystals and poured magical power into their bodies through the air. When it was done, they thanked Gu Ning.

After that, the injured continued to stay in the Military General Hospital, while Gu Ning and the others went to stay in a hotel, and they would return to the capital tomorrow noon.

They successfully finished the task this time, but not completely, because they only destroyed one of their enemy’s bases in their country. Perhaps their enemies had other bases, but they didn’t know where they were.

Country Hua was so large that they couldn’t search all around the country little by little. If their enemies weren’t dumb, they probably wouldn’t find anything even after a few years.
