954 A Private Pleasure Boa

“Fine.”

Since Gu Ning said that, Gu Qingshi agreed, then walked to the car behind the Lamborghini.

In the car, Gu Man, Gu Qing and Wen Yulan began to chat with each other.

Neither Gu Qing and Wen Yulan were aware of Tang Yunfan’s family background yet. Gu Man just told them that Tang Yunfan was a businessman, but didn’t tell them many details.

When they arrived at Huafu Hills, they were shocked again by Gu Ning’s beautiful house.

They all knew that the housing price in City B was unusually high, so this large downtown house must be worth dozens of millions of yuan too.

Although it wasn’t much in Gu Ning’s eyes, they were still greatly surprised.

Gu Ning guided them into it, and arranged rooms for them.

Jiang Xu stayed alone, while Gu Qinyang and Gu Qingshi shared a room on the second floor. Gu Qing and Jiang Xinyue stayed together in the same room, so did Wen Yulan and Gu Yinyin. Gu Man and Gu Ning slept in their own rooms.

The rooms of the house were fully occupied by them now, so Gu Ning told Gao Yi and Qiao Ya to stay outside for a few days. They could have a break.

Gu Ning told her relatives to have a rest for a while first, and that they would go share a meal together before they went to have a tour.

...

When it was 5:30 pm, Gu Ning left the house with the others. Gu Qingshi, Gu Yinyin and Jiang Xinyue sat in Gu Ning’s car this time, while the others sat in the MPV.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya were back now, so Gao Yi drove the MPV.

“Wow, a luxurious car is really comfortable!” Gu Qingshi sat in the front passenger’s seat.

“If the three of you study hard, I’ll buy you cars after your graduation from university,” Gu Ning said. She was very generous towards her family.

“Really?” Gu Qingshi was the most excited among the kids. Boys all loved cars.

Although Jiang Xinyue and Gu Yinyin weren’t as excited as him, they were also thrilled.

Gu Ning took them to the Huangdeng Hotel for dinner. Tang Haifeng had asked Gu Ning whether they wanted to dine with the Tang family, but Gu Ning declined his invitation.

Even though they were Gu Man’s family, they weren’t the older generation, and it wasn’t necessary for them to meet the Tang family right now.

No matter how close Gu Man was to her brothers and sisters, they should still keep a polite distance from each other.

...

After dinner, Gu Ning took them out for a tour.

The first place they went to was the famous river in City B.

Tang Yunfan had arranged a pleasure boat for them before they reached the river.

When they got off at the wharf, they met Wen Yulan’s colleague again. The woman came along with two friends for a tour on the river as well. However, there were too many tourists at this time, so they had to wait for an available pleasure boat.

It was very normal to wait for boats, but they felt displeased when a security guard stopped them from getting aboard the small pleasure boat docked by the shore. They asked the security guard for the reason, and the security guard told them that it wasn’t a pleasure boat for tourists.

Therefore, they were annoyed when Gu Ning and the others went aboard it.

Wen Yulan’s colleague didn’t say anything, but her friends lost their temper. When her friend wanted to argue with Gu Ning, Wen Yulan’s colleague stopped her.

“Why are you pulling me back? Why can they get aboard? I need to argue with them!” The woman’s friend said with dissatisfaction.

“I know them. They aren’t ordinary people,” the woman said.

Her friend, however, looked arrogant. “Since you know them, why don’t you tell them to share the boat with us?”

“I just had an argument with them. I’m lucky enough that they didn’t punish me. I don’t dare to ask them for help!” the woman said.

Hearing that, her friend closed her mouth. They remained silent, but some tourists were annoyed.

“Hey, didn’t you say that we all have to wait for available boats? Why could they get aboard before us?” a young man questioned the security guard, followed by two women and a man. They must be two couples.

“It isn’t a pleasure boat for tourists, it’s a private one,” the security guard said.

It turned out to be a private pleasure boat!

Hearing that, the young man closed his mouth too.

“It’s a private pleasure boat? They must be very rich,” someone said.

“Right, they can’t be ordinary people if they own a private pleasure boat here.”

...

“Who are they?” The woman’s friend asked her with curiosity. She was a gossip lover.

“The young girl is the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry, Gu Ning,” the woman said. Thinking of Wen Yulan’s family connection with Gu Ning, she was still jealous.

“What? The girl is Gu Ning, the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry?”

The woman’s two friends were both surprised. They had heard of Jade Beauty Jewelry, because it was very famous now.

“Well, why did you have an argument with her just then?” the woman’s friend asked again.

“I just made fun of her relative. It’s not a big deal,” the woman said, but she didn’t dare do that again.

Hearing that, her friends felt a little relieved. They had been wondering whether they should keep a distance from her if she had annoyed Gu Ning. Luckily, it wasn’t a big deal.

...

Gu Ning and her family got onto the pleasure boat. Although the boat wasn’t very large, it was big enough to accommodate them.

It was a private pleasure boat, so it had the same layout as a home, with a living room, bathroom, kitchen and a bedroom inside.
