Chapter 162 Membership Canceled

“How much is it?” Gu Ning asked the boss.

“To be honest with you, I’ll be immigrating to Country Y ina few months, and I already had the intention to sell this salon. I’ve dealt with all the details. It’s worth 3.2 million yuan including everything in this place,” Yu Na said. She took out the list and the contract from her bag handing them to Gu Ning. “This is the list. You can check all the objects first. If you don’t have any questions, we can sign the contract before we go to the relative departments to finish the legal procedure.” “Sure,” Gu Ning took the list and the contract, but she didn’t review them at once. “I think we better solve the problem we have right now.”

“How do you want to handle it?” Yu Na asked.

“Since I’ve decided to acquire this beauty salon, I think I have the power to make some decisions, right?” Gu Ning asked. “Of course,” Yu Na replied.

“Very well, first, this Mrs. Wu’s membership must be canceled. And this beautician is fired. I won’t allow snobbish people to work in my store,” Gu Ning said in an undeniable way. The rest all respected her unconsciously.

Although the beautician was reluctant to be fired, she understood that it was too late to make up for it.

However, Mrs. Wu wasn’t happy about that decision. She questioned in anger, “Why should my membership be canceled?”

“Because I’ll be the boss of this beauty salon soon, and I have the power to do so,” Gu Ning said.

“Even though you’re the boss, aren’t you afraid that it will damage your reputation that you randomly cancel your customers’ membership?” Mrs. Wu reacted swiftly.

“That depends on what kind of customer you’re. If it’s a customer like you, who is arrogant and rude, sorry, you’re not welcome here,” Gu Ning replied calmly, which left a great impression on the others.

“You...” Mrs. Wu was mad, but didn’t know what to say.

“Li Li, go take them to do the procedures,” Yu Na offered. “Who cares! There isn’t only one skincare saloon anyway!” Mrs. Wu was irritated, but she wasn’t willing to stay any longer, since Gu Ning would be the boss of it.

After Mrs. Wu and the beautician were gone, Gu Ning looked to the crowd saying, “All the staff of Kamei Beauty Salon, although I’m not the boss yet, I think it’s better to make it clear right now. If you can’t meet the principles on the wall, you may quit on your own initiative. Otherwise, you’ll be punished once I find that you disobeyed the rules.”

Her words were powerful and persuasive. No one thought that she was only a young girl, but more of a successful businesswoman. At short notice, everyone admired Gu Ning. Generally speaking, the entire staff here was excellent. Only a few of them were black sheep.

Yu Na stared at Gu Ning with appreciation. This young girl indeed wasn’t ordinary.

“Of course, as long as you obey the rules, work hard, I won’t treat you unfairly on the salary,” Gu Ning added.

“And all the customers here, this is a place that values equality. No matter if you’re from the rich or the powerful families, please show some respect to one another. Please treat others the way you want to be treated,” Gu Ning said.

After a second, Gu Ning continued, “After I sign the contract and finish the legal procedure, my mother, Gu Man, and my aunt, Gu Qing, will be the bosses of this beauty salon. Please be aware of that, thanks!”

“Congratulations!” all the customers said. They all had a high opinion of what Gu Ning had done today.

The mess was cleared. And all the workers went back to work. Gu Ning then brought Gu Man and Gu Qing to check the objects and items on the list and the accounts.

Meanwhile, Yu Na also reminded the staff in Kamei Beauty Salon to work well. She believed in Gu Ning, and hoped that others would do the same thing. Facing Yu Na, everyone trusted and agreed with her. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

With Gu Ning’s outstanding ability, she finished all the lists and accounts within half an hour. There was nothing wrong. Yu Na was quite surprised by Gu Ning’s efficiency. She asked, “Wow, you’re so efficient! Is everything right?”

“I’m good at reading and memorizing,” Gu Ning replied. She wasn’t showing off, but proved her qualifications at the right time.

“You must be an excellent student!” Yu Na said.

“You’re right,” Gu Ning answered.

Yu Na smiled. She now appreciated Gu Ning more. She must be an extraordinary girl.

“Alright, it’s almost 11 am. We need to finish the procedures before the department closes today,” Yu Na took a look at the clock saying.

Although it was a Sunday, the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the State Taxation Administration were still open. They went to the Industry and Commerce Bureau to register the property rights change information, and then went to the State Taxation Administration to register the equity information. Yu Na knew someone who worked in those two departments, so it was very smooth for them to finish all the processes. They finished it before 12 pm.

The legal entity was Gu Man, accounting for 51% shares. The only shareholder was Gu Qing, accounting for 49% shares. Both Gu Man and Gu Qing felt like they were in a dream even after they had finished the processes. It was too good to be true. From now on, they were the bosses of this beauty salon. It happened too fast for them to react.

“What we’ve done today is the only case I’ve settled so quickly! Thank you, Miss Gu,” Yu Na said to Gu Ning. It wasn’t easy to meet a buyer like Gu Ning who readily agreed to settle a deal. Other buyers would normally try their best to bargain. Businessmen always value benefits most.

Although Gu Ning agreed to buy this saloon without delay, Yu Na didn’t think that she knew nothing about this business. Gu Ning was a generous person herself.

“Miss Yu, I should thank you for your help. I need this salon too,” Gu Ning replied.

“It’s 12 pm now. We need to celebrate the deal today. Why don’t we go have lunch together? It’s on me!” Yu Na invited.
