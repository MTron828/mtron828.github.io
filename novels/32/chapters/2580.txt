Chapter 2583: Surprise Leng Shaoting

Most importantly, how did Gu Ning know they were coming?

Either way, they were sure that Gu Ning was before them, and she caused those loud screams.

No matter how she got to know they were here, she knew. Gu Ning had magical powers, so it wasn’t too surprising that she could do that. Therefore, they stopped shooting and immediately went ahead.

When Xu Jinchen and his comrades were only three meters away, they finally saw what was happening over there. Gu Ning was indeed there, along with a strange girl.

By that time, they had nearly finished beating those men.

Xu Jinchen and his comrades felt a little embarrassed. They had chased those criminals for a long time and only killed three of them, but Gu Ning knocked down seven as soon as she showed up.

The girl who was with Gu Ning was also very strong.

They were aware of Gu Ning’s abilities, so they didn’t feel self-abased. On the other hand, Gu Ning was their idol.

In fact, the criminals were more surprised than them. To their astonishment, two girls without any weapons could beat them to the ground so easily.

Although they had already been caught by Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue, Xu Jinchen and his comrades still went ahead to help them.

“What are you doing here?” Xu Jinchen asked Gu Ning afterwards. He didn’t call her name to make sure that their identities weren’t exposed.

“I passed by coincidentally and heard the gunshots. I saw you after observing for a while, so I took action,” said Gu Ning.

Although they didn’t know why Gu Ning was there so late at night, they didn’t doubt her words.

“Will you go back with us? Shaoting went to chase their leader. I’m sure he must have already caught him,” said Xu Jinchen. Given Leng Shaoting’s abilities, he should be able to catch the criminals much quicker than them. Even though the leader was stronger than these hoodlums, he was no match for Leng Shaoting.

This time, they moved separately because this group of gangsters divided into two small groups and tried to escape. They noticed it quickly, so they went to catch them separately as well.

“Sure.” Since Leng Shaoting was also here, Gu Ning would definitely go to see him. Anyway, there was nothing for her to deal with right now.

Baili Zongxue followed wherever Gu Ning went.

After that, Gu Ning left with them.

Because the criminals were there, Xu Jinchen and the others didn’t talk with Gu Ning.

Besides, there wasn’t any signal in the remote mountains, so Chen Meng couldn’t contact their other comrades until they got to a place with a signal.

They chased them on foot for a long time. They were already far away from their base, so they would have to walk for hours to get back. In that case, they had to call their comrades to pick them up.

After walking for half an hour, they finally saw a wide road, but the car hadn’t arrived yet, so they stayed in the woods for the time being.

About twenty minutes later, a car came. It was a big military car which could accommodate a lot of people. There were many of them after all, so they needed a large car.

Si Ming was sitting in the driver’s seat. When he saw Gu Ning, he was very surprised, but he didn’t ask.

Xu Jinchen let Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue sit in the front passenger seat. They were two young girls, so they couldn’t stay in the back along with a group of men. Besides, if Leng Shaoting found out, he would surely be mad at them.

Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue were happy to sit separately from the men.

After the car started moving, Si Ming asked Gu Ning quietly, “What are you doing here?”

“I came to buy a mountain to mine raw jade materials, but I heard gunshots on my way back. After observing for a while, I saw them and decided to help,” said Gu Ning.

Hearing that, Si Ming nodded, not doubting her words.

“Oh, does Shaoting know that you met them? He just caught their leader when I came to pick you up,” said Si Ming.

“Not yet, I’ll surprise him.” Gu Ning smiled, looking forward to seeing Leng Shaoting’s reaction when he saw her.

“He’ll be astonished and excited. After all, you haven’t seen each other for more than half a month,” said Si Ming. There was no need to guess, because the answer couldn’t be more obvious.

Actually, it wasn’t that long. Si Ming had been separated from Qiu Yuxin for even longer.

Thinking of that, Si Ming missed his girlfriend.

Along the way, they said nothing further. After driving for about fifty minutes, they arrived at an abandoned house in a suburb of City Rui. There weren’t many residents, so the houses were gradually abandoned.

In the house were Leng Shaoting, Zhao Weixian, and the head of the illegal gang.

When the car moved closer, Leng Shaoting sensed a cultivator and frowned slightly. Without hesitation, he walked out.

After walking out, Leng Shaoting felt that the cultivator was in their car. Was there a cultivator in the illegal gang?

The cultivator wasn’t at a high level, but he or she shouldn’t have been caught by Xu Jinchen.

Leng Shaoting was a little confused, staring at the car.

When Leng Shaoting walked out, Gu Ning also saw him and couldn’t wait to give him a hug.

The moment the car drove in front of Leng Shaoting, Gu Ning met his eyes. It was dark, but Leng Shaoting had a very good sight and immediately recognized Gu Ning. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Gu Ning beamed, while Leng Shaoting was startled. Afterwards, he was astonished and showed great excitement.

Ningning? What was she doing here?

Leng Shaoting didn’t think that Gu Ning came to City Rui for him, so he felt it must be a coincidence.

Why did Gu Ning come to City Rui? Leng Shaoting quickly figured it out, because Gu Ning had told him that she wanted to mine raw jade materials in City Rui. If he guessed correctly, she came here for jade.

Once the car stopped, Leng Shaoting walked over to open the car door for Gu Ning.

Gu Ning sat by the window, so Leng Shaoting held her hand as soon as she got out of the car. “What are you doing here?”

He questioned her with concern.
