Chapter 1486: Excruciating Torture

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Qi Ziyue thought for a while, then asked, “Does what happened at my wedding today have something to do with you?”

“Yes, you’re right,” Gu Ning said.

“What’s your relationship with Tang Aining? How much do you know about her?” Qi Ziyue asked again.

“Will you believe me if I tell you that I’m her.” Gu Ning half joked.

“Are you kidding me?” Qi Ziyue couldn’t believe it.

Tang Aining was shot twice before she jumped into the ocean. It was impossible for her to survive in that situation. Besides, they found Tang Aining’s body later and burned it to ashes in front of them. Moreover, Gu Ning was much younger than Tang Aining. Even if she had plastic surgery, it wouldn’t be able to change her that much!

“Believe it or not, it’s the truth.” Gu Ning shrugged.

Anyway, she didn’t care about Qi Ziyue’s feelings. “Well, I was also the ‘Tang Aining’ at your wedding today.”

Gu Ning aimed to torture Qi Ziyue over a long time, so she didn’t mind wasting time talking with him. She wanted to see him being annoyed.

“What?” Qi Ziyue was shocked. It was obvious that he didn’t believe it either.

Gu Ning understood that it was very hard for him to accept it, but she had no intention to explain it further.

“Do you think that you can do whatever you want as long as Tang Aining is dead?” Gu Ning walked near.

Qi Ziyue indeed had that thought, because he was selfish and self-centered. Nobody would believe that Tang Aining could be reincarnated.

“You...” Qi Ziyue was terrified now.

Even though Gu Ning wasn’t Tang Aining, she came here because of Tang Aining, and he was sure that she planned to hurt him.

“Why do you still want to take revenge? She’s already dead!” Qi Ziyue shouted.

Hearing that, Gu Ning sneered and looked displeased. If Tang Aining was really dead, nobody would bother to take revenge for her, but fortunately her soul stayed and now lived in another girl’s body.

“You killed her. How can you sleep well at night?” Gu Ning asked with hatred.

Qi Ziyue opened his mouth, but didn’t know what to say now. In his eyes, he didn’t think that it was a big deal because Tang Aining stood in his way to success.

Gu Ning continued, “I’m her only apprentice, so I should certainly take revenge for her.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Qi Ziyue was struck dumb for a second, but it was more acceptable to him that Gu Ning turned out to be Tang Aining’s apprentice.

“What do you want to do?” Qi Ziyue’s voice was trembling in fear. He knew that he was no match for Gu Ning and that it was useless for him to struggle against her. He didn’t want to accept it, but he couldn’t do anything about it.

“Relax, I won’t kill you, but you will probably beg me to do that after being tortured by me.” Gu Ning put on an evil smile.

Qi Ziyue’s body was also shaking in fear now.

Gu Ning’s face was only several centimeters away from his, and he felt helpless at this moment. He wanted to run away, but could barely move because of the effects of the alcohol. If he had to be tortured by his enemy, he would rather be killed! However, he still wanted to take revenge, so he couldn’t die right now.

Gu Ning didn’t want to waste time talking with Qi Ziyue, so she took out a bag of something.

“W-What are you doing? What is this?” Qi Ziyue was in a sheer panic. He struggled but didn’t have the strength to leave the bed.

After that, Gu Ning caught his jaw and forced him to face her.

Qi Ziyue was frightened, but he could only see the white powder being poured into his mouth before he was forced to swallow it.

It was a drug, which came from the box of drugs that Gu Ning had put away in her telepathic eye space before. She kept it in case she needed it in the future, and now she found that it was indeed useful.

Qi Ziyue soon lost his reason and his mind began to be affected by the drug. He suffered hallucinations and saw Tang Bingsen standing in front of him.

Tang Bingsen was his arch enemy, so he shouted as he stood up, “I’ll kill you. I’ll kill you! It’s all your fault! You killed my father. You killed my mother. You ruined my family!”

Gu Ning actually had sympathy for what Qi Ziyue’s family had been through, but it wasn’t enough to make her forgive the fact that Qi Ziyue had forced her to die.
