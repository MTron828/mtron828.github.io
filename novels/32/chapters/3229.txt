3231 Your Grandfather Really Spoils You

Old Mrs. Wang was mad, but still called Zhao Shanchuan again, but he refused to answer her call.

“How could uncle do that to us?” Wang Xiangyang was also angry that Zhao Shanchuan didn’t want to help them.

When Old Mrs. Wang called again, Zhao Shanchuan directly turned his phone off, which greatly angered Old Mrs. Wang.

However, Old Mrs. Wang still needed Zhao Shanchuan’s help, so she decided to visit Zhao Shanchuan at his home.

Old Mrs Wang wasn’t seriously injured so she left the hospital yesterday. She wasn’t agile, but she could still walk.

…

What Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen had done in the circuit quickly became hot news. Chu Jianan and the others also heard about it.

However, no one knew their names. They only heard that they were a beautiful young girl and a handsome young man in their twenties, so Chu Jianan and the others didn’t realize that they were Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen.

However, he subconsciously thought that it was possible because the ages and appearances matched Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen.

He wondered whether Leng Xiaoyao was actually skilled at car racing.

Nevertheless, Chu Jianan was very unhappy that Leng Xiaoyao became so outstanding.

He had mixed emotions. He couldn’t stop being attracted to such an impressive girl, but he still harbored grudges against her for humiliating him. He had the desire to either have her or ruin her.

After meeting Leng Xiaoyao today, the desire grew stronger.

…

Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen stayed at the circuit and ate with Si Yiqi and the others. After the meal, Li Mochen drove Leng Xiaoyao home.

On the way, Li Mochen received Mu Yiyang’s call. Mu Yiyang said that they were carrying out a task and found a strange ancient building deep in the mountain.

It was May. The weather had become warmer. Even if it wasn’t hot, it shouldn’t be cold. However, as soon as they got close to the ancient building, they felt extremely cold. Especially after they entered it, the temperature seemed to drop to below five degrees, making them all shake from the cold.

In addition, it was the day and was very bright outside, but it was dark inside the building.

Besides, the yard of the ancient building contained many bones and looked creepy. None of them dared go in. They were so scared that they returned directly.

Upon hearing that, Leng Xiaoyao, who was next to Li Mochen, was interested. “Where is it? Can I go have a look?”

Mu Yiyang, on the other side of the phone, was struck dumb once he heard Leng Xiaoyao’s voice. The next moment, he laughed and joked. “Oh, I just left the capital city and you rushed to see Leng Xiaoyao in City Chang. Good for you!”

“Nonsense!” Li Mochen was displeased and immediately snapped at Mu Yiyang. Although it was the truth, he wouldn’t admit it.

“It’s true! Or did Leng Xiaoyao go to the capital city to see you?” Mu Yiyang didn’t believe it and was sure that Li Mochen had a lot of interest in Leng Xiaoyao.

“Where is the ancient building?” Li Mochen asked. He didn’t want to argue with Mu Yiyang.

Mu Yiyang didn’t continue either. “It’s in City Qin, deep into Qinjiao Mountain. I don’t know its specific location, but if you want to come, I can take you there. You can also help me with it, ha-ha!”

This task was slightly tricky, not only because this ancient building was creepy, but also because the whole Qinjiao Mountain was very strange. Therefore, they didn’t dare to take action.

Li Mochen turned to look at Leng Xiaoyao. “When do you want to go?”

“Right now. If there is a plane going to City Qin, we can leave right away,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She couldn’t wait to see the mountain. Without delay, she used her phone to search for plane tickets.

“Will your family let you go?” asked Li Mochen. He felt that Leng Changyuan would be worried about her and might not allow her to go there.

“Don’t worry, I can deal with it,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Great.” If so, Li Mochen didn’t need to worry about her. After that, he said to Mu Yiyang. “We’ll book plane tickets right now. If everything goes well, we can meet tonight.”

“Sure, see you then,” Mu Yiyang replied.

“There are plane tickets to City Qin tonight. It’ll take off in two hours,” Leng Xiaoyao said a little excitedly.

“I’ll book the plane tickets,” Li Mochen said, doing it on the phone.

“No problem.” Leng Xiaoyao didn’t turn him down. She told Li Mochen her ID information, then Li Mochen booked plane tickets to City Qin.

After they decided to go to City Qin, Mu Yuan drove straight to the airport.

Because the circuit was near the suburb, they needed to spend about fifty minutes on the road. It wasn’t bad for them to go to the airport right now.

Leng Xiaoyao called Leng Changyuan when they were halfway there. She said that she was traveling to City Qin with her classmates tonight and that they had already booked the plane tickets.

Leng Changyuan could do nothing about it since Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t tell him what she was doing till it was too late. He understood that he couldn’t stop her, so he could only remind her to be careful.

Leng Changyuan spoiled her because he loved her, but also because he had confidence in her.

If she was just a weak girl, he wouldn’t allow her to travel around no matter how much he loved her.

“Miss Leng, your grandfather really spoils you,” Meng Fan said with a smile.

“It’s mainly because he bbelieves that I can protect myself,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Right.” Meng Fan couldn’t deny it. Leng Xiaoyao was so strong, there were few people who could hurt her!

Currently it was about 7:30 pm. They would arrive at the airport at about 8:20 pm and the plane would take off at 9:30 pm.

The flight was about an hour and fifteen minutes, so they arrived at the airport of City Qin at about 11:20 pm.

They spent twenty minutes leaving the airport.

When they arrived, Mu Yiyang was already waiting for them outside the airport, but he was alone.

As soon as Leng Xiaoyao and the others arrived, they met Mu Yiyang and left by car.

“Do you want to go there right now or tomorrow morning?” asked Mu Yiyang.

“Right now,” Leng Xiaoyao replied.

Although Leng Xiaoyao answered the question, Li Mochen said nothing, so Mu Yiyang understood that Li Mochen agreed with Leng Xiaoyao, and he didn’t bother to ask again. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

It didn’t matter even if they took action at night. Instead, it might be more convenient.

“Are we enough, or do you need me to call more people?” asked Mu Yiyang. He was afraid that it might be inappropriate for his teammates to go but they might need more people to deal with it.

“We’re enough,” Li Mochen said. It was indeed inconvenient to take other people with. He trusted Mu Yiyang’s teammates, but they were going to use their magical power, so it was better to keep it a secret.
