I“m Willing to Help

“Well, aren’t you afraid that I’ll leak this important information?” Gu Ning asked.

“Miss Gu, I trust you, and I don’t think that you’re a bad person. By the way, you better not leak any information about this important task, or you’ll be arrested by the police. No matter how powerful you are, you would probably have to spend the rest of your life in jail,” Li Zhongwei said.

“What if I fail to finish this task?” Gu Ning asked. She didn’t mind Li Zhongwei’s threat.

“Miss Gu, I need to be honest with you about it. If you fail, it won’t cause great damage to us, but your life might be in great danger, so I hope that you can carefully think about it before you make your decision,” Li Zhongwei said. “We don’t want you to be hurt.”

“No problem, I’m willing to help,” Gu Ning said without hesitation. She didn’t bother to think about it because she thought that this task was meaningful to their country.

If Li Zhongwei forced her to do it, Gu Ning wouldn’t agree, but she was more than willing to help since he cared about her life too.

“Really?” Li Zhongwei’s eyes lit up at once. “Thank you so much, Miss Gu!”

“You don’t need to thank me. I’m willing to do something that is helpful to our country,” Gu Ning said.

Action spoke louder than words.

Li Zhongwei admired Gu Ning more than ever now.

“Oh, Miss Gu, are you free this afternoon? Can we share a meal together?” Li Zhongwei said.

“Sure!” Gu Ning understood that Li Zhongwei was going to bring her to meet his teammates, so she agreed.

It was past 4 pm now, and it was almost time for dinner.

...

Afterwards, Gu Ning drove her car and followed Li Zhongwei.

They were going to meet the SWAT team, and wouldn’t go to the wharf until 7 pm that night.

When it was about 5:30 pm, Gu Ning and Li Zhongwei arrived.

They normally got off work after 6 pm, so Li Zhongwei’s teammates were still at work.

They didn’t need to sit in the office all day, and they could walk around in the yard if there was nothing to deal with. Therefore, at this time, there were many people chatting in the yard.

The second a white Lamborghini drove into the yard, it attracted a lot of attention from the people in the yard.

The next second, a black Land Rover, which was Li Zhongwei’s car, drove in too.

They got curious and walked to the Lamborghini.

When Gu Ning got out of it, they were amazed by her beauty and greeted her at once, “Hi, beauty!”

“Nice to meet you!” Gu Ning smiled at them.

“Hey, what’s your name?” someone asked Gu Ning.

“My name’s Gu Ning,” Gu Ning said.

“Gu Ning? It sounds familiar,” SWAT A said.

“I think it sounds familiar too, but I can’t remember where I’ve heard it before,” SWAT B said.

“...”

Many of them were familiar with Gu Ning’s name.

“That’s such an ancient pick-up line!” SWAT C mocked them.

“Ha-ha, ha-ha,” SWAT D laughed out loud.

“I mean it!” SWAT argued.

“Fine, fine, I believe you,” SWAT C said.

“What? Do you want a fight?” SWAT A was annoyed.

They were used to joking and playing with each other like that, and they practiced their fighting skills frequently in this way. They weren’t really going to beat one another.

“Ignore them. Let’s go inside now,” Li Zhongwei said to Gu Ning.

Although they wanted to talk more with Gu Ning, they knew that Gu Ning came there for something serious, so they didn’t stop her. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Gu Ning, Gu Ning.”

After Gu Ning and Li Zhongwei were gone, SWAT A was still repeating Gu Ning’s name trying to remember something.

“Hey, Qin, what are you mumbling? Are you too amazed by the beautiful girl?” SWAT D hit SWAT A’s shoulder all of a sudden.

SWAT A was scared and raised his head.

“I’m not!” He argued.

“I need to check her name on the Internet,” SWAT B said. He also wanted to figure out why he thought Gu Ning’s name sounded familiar.

The others were confused by their reaction. They thought that maybe Gu Ning was a famous person.

“Oh, no wonder her name sounds so familiar!” SWAT B suddenly shouted with excitement.

“It’s her!” he said after reading several pieces of news about Gu Ning.

Other people were surprised by SWAT B’s reaction. They ran to have a look at his phone, but SWAT A grabbed it away.
