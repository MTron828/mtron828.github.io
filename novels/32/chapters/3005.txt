3006 Not Dangerous at All

“Miss Leng, is it enough to only use scalpels? Don’t you need other equipment?” Ji Yanxi asked worriedly.

“Don’t worry. Since I dare to do the operation, I have the confidence to succeed,” Leng Xiaoyao said confidently.

They were still very nervous, but they were left with no choice right now. They could only face it.

Afterwards, Ji Yanxi said nothing further.

Before the operation, it was necessary to inject anesthetic, otherwise Han Yu would be in great pain.

After injecting the anesthetic, Leng Xiaoyao put on sterile gloves and did the operation.

Han Yu’s injury was next to his heart, which was extremely dangerous.

Leng Xiaoyao picked up a scalpel. After disinfecting, she cut deep into his chest. In an instant, blood poured out, which scared Ji Yanxi. He didn’t dare to look straight at it.

Ji Yanxi was always involved in illegal deeds. He had been through a lot and had even killed, but he had never felt scared when he did these things.

However, when he saw the scalpel cut into Han Yu’s body and the blood immediately pouring out, he felt extremely nervous. After all, Han Yu was his close brother! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Even though he felt extremely nervous, he had to watch it from the beginning to the end, in case any accidents happened.

The moment the scalpel cut into Han Yu’s body, Han Yu lost a lot of blood, but he stopped bleeding after a short while, because Leng Xiaoyao used her magical energy to freeze the blood vessels near the cut.

Seeing that the wound stopped bleeding, Ji Yanxi was really curious, but Leng Xiaoyao was still conducting the operation, so he didn’t dare to interrupt her.

Leng Xiaoyao was very quick and accurate. It seemed as if she had done operations many times before. Ji Yanxi was amazed, and he could see that Leng Xiaoyao was professional.

Therefore, he was less and less worried as hope began to replace his fear.

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning’s kids were all talented. They could do almost everything. In fact, Leng Xiaoyao had indeed done operations many times before.

A few minutes later, Leng Xiaoyao saw the bullet. Without hesitation, she withdrew it. Seeing that, Ji Yanxi had his heart in his throat.

The bullet was smoothly taken out and no accidents happened. Afterwards, Leng Xiaoyao cleared the wound, then treated it and stitched it up.

Leng Xiaoyao stitched it up perfectly, but she had cut Han Yu’s body open, so there would obviously be a wound.

It wasn’t important. Most importantly, Han Yu survived.

After stitching the wound, Leng Xiaoyao applied herbs to the wound and wrapped it up with bandages.

Because it took a lot of her strength and magical energy to do the operation, she was exhausted and sweating heavily, but the operation wasn’t over, so Ji Yanxi didn’t dare to wipe the sweat off her forehead. He didn’t want anything bad to happen. As soon as Leng Xiaoyao finished the operation, Ji Yanxi stepped forward and wiped the sweat off for her.

It was very rare for Ji Yanxi to treat someone like that, but Leng Xiaoyao had saved his close brother’s life, so he was willing to do that for her.

Leng Xiaoyao spent nearly half an hour on this operation, which was really efficient.

“Miss Leng, thank you so much for your effort. How’s Han Yu now?” Ji Yanxi asked. It looked successful, but he wouldn’t be relieved until Leng Xiaoyao gave him an answer.

“It was very successful. His life isn’t in danger at all. After an hour, he should wake up. Then you can help him take the medicine. I believe that he can make a full recovery in a few months. In order to set your mind at rest, you can call a doctor over to check his condition. I won’t leave until he’s awake,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Sure.” Ji Yanxi answered. Even if Leng Xiaoyao didn’t say that, he would still call a doctor over to check Han Yu’s condition. So if Leng Xiaoyao stayed until Han Yu woke up, it would be for the best.

“Alright, I need to see how the medicine is now,” Leng Xiaoyao said, then walked out.

“You just finished the operation. Don’t you need to have a rest?” Ji Yanxi asked with concern. He could see that Leng Xiaoyao was tired.

“I’ll rest after making sure the medicine is fine. You can call a doctor that you trust to come over now,” Leng Xiaoyao said, then she went out.

After that, Ji Yanxi called his close friend who was a doctor.

The man also had a close relationship with Han Yu, so he was aware of Han Yu’s condition.

Although he was skilled too, he only promised Han Yu a 50% probability that the operation could be successful.

Leng Xiaoyao had reminded them to keep the operation a secret, so they didn’t tell other people.

If other people heard about it, they would stop the operation from happening.

They didn’t want Han Yu to lose the chance to survive, which would be a great loss.

It was Han Yu’s decision, so he would insist even if other people wanted to stop it, but there were still worries.

What if other people angered Leng Xiaoyao and she changed her mind?

When Ji Yanxi called his close friend, he didn’t say that Han Yu had already accepted the operation. He only told his friend to come over and check on Han Yu’s physical condition.

Once his friend heard that Han Yu needed a medical check-up, he thought Han Yu was in danger, so he hurriedly came over with the stuff he needed.

…

The young woman who met Leng Xiaoyao by chance called her mother out to talk about the formula once she got home.

She didn’t think her mother would want to hurt the baby in her sister-in-law’s belly, because her mother had a good relationship with her sister-in-law. And they had long looked forward to seeing the baby. It was impossible that her mother would have the intention of killing the baby.

However, there was indeed a problem with the formula, so she must make it clear. She didn’t want any mistakes to happen again.

“Mom, where did you get this formula?” the woman asked.

“Your aunt helped me get it from a familiar person. She said this medicine is good for the baby. Your cousin has used it and it’s helpful. What happened? Is there anything wrong with this formula?” The young woman’s mother wasn’t dumb and realized that there might be a problem when her daughter asked to have a private talk.

“There is indeed a problem with it,” the young woman said, staring straight at her mother. She didn’t believe her mother would harm the grandchild, but it was her mother who told her to prepare the medicine. Therefore, she had to make sure.
