Chapter 642 Meet Leng Shaojia

If they were going to unseat the Shen family, they had to seize the best opportunity. Leng Shaoting would never allow them to survive. His parents had been killed precisely because their enemies had survived, and he wouldn’t make that mistake again.

“You’re right,” Master Leng said.

“Oh, how long will you stay here with me this time?” Master Leng asked.

“I’ll leave right after dinner; I have something else to deal with,” Leng Shaoting said. Actually, he was eager to go back to Gu Ning’s side now.

“Why do you have to leave in a hurry?” Master Leng was disappointed, but he wouldn’t stop Leng Shaoting from leaving.

In the hospital.

Cao Wenxin didn’t remember that it was Ai Xinyu’s birthday until she received Ai Xinyu’s call around 5 pm. She came to the capital to attend Ai Xinyu’s birthday party, but now she was absent from it! However, she thought that it wasn’t appropriate to leave Xin Bei alone in the hospital.

Seeing Cao Wenxin getting restless, Xin Bei asked her, “What’s wrong?” “Um, actually today’s my friend’s birthday,” Cao Wenxin said with embarrassment.

“Don’t worry. You can leave if you like.” Xin Bei understood that Cao Wenxin hesitated to leave because of him.

“Are you sure you’ll be fine alone here?” Cao Wenxin felt a little guilty. She promised to take care of him, but she was going to leave him alone now. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If you’re worried about me, you can visit me tonight after the party,” Xin Bei said. In fact, there was no need for her to keep him company the entire time, but he enjoyed her company.

“Sure, then I’ll visit you tonight,” Cao Wenxin said. “Oh, what do you want to eat? I can help you order some.”

Xin Bei thought for a while, then said, “Well, it’s said that what you eat can improve certain parts of your body. I think I need to improve my brain now, so please help me order fish head soup.”

“Ha-ha.” Cao Wenxin snorted with laughter. “No problem.”

She called the Huangdeng Hotel and told them to prepare fish head soup right now and deliver it to the hospital.

Cao Wenxin was a great beauty, and her smile stunned Xin Bei.

When it was 6 pm, other members of the Leng family came home after work. Leng Yuanqian’s family was displeased to see Leng Shaoting, and only Leng Yuanzhen’s family greeted him kindly.

Leng Shaoting treated them the same way back.

Leng Shaoxun and Leng Shaoxi stayed in their schools, and Leng Shaojia was having fun with her friends, so they were all absent.

Gu Ning was also about to dine with Song Manni and Xia Yichu.

She had been in the capital for a few days, and Xia Yichu finally had a chance to meet her. Gu Ning was Xia Yichu’s idol now, not only because Gu Ning had helped her a lot, but also because of the news about Gu Ning.

Precisely because of the popular news about Gu Ning, many reporters wanted to interview her, and even went to her school. Unfortunately, Gu Ning was absent, and the principal refused to give them Gu Ning’s phone number without Gu Ning’s permission.

Xia Yichu also thanked Gu Ning in person for the skincare products she had sent her.

Although Xia Yichu hadn’t had her debut yet, and she could hang out wherever and whenever she wanted, she wouldn’t be able to do it once she became famous.

They didn’t go dine in a luxurious hotel, but went to the biggest commercial district in the capital. It wasn’t far from the building of Gu Ning’s corporation, and it only took several minutes of driving for them to get there.

Gu Ning still drove Chen Cangyi’s car. Her corporation wasn’t open for business yet, so she hadn’t bought cars.

This commercial district with a long history was located downtown, and there were many time-honored shops along the streets.

There was a large delicious section of the city in the center of this commercial district, providing varied traditional food and exotic food.

They didn’t know what to eat, so they decided to walk around to see what they wanted. In the end, they found a local hotpot restaurant. Although there weren’t private rooms and people were all eating in a big hall, it was super popular. Therefore, Gu Ning and the others thought that it’s food must be very good and walked inside.

“Hi, are there any vacant seats?” Gu Ning asked.

“Miss, you’re very lucky today. There is one vacant table,” the waitress said with a smile.

“I’ll book it!” Before Gu Ning could say a word, another female voice sounded from behind them.

Hearing that, Gu Ning and the others were annoyed and turned back to look at the woman. The woman also came with two female friends, and they were all in their early twenties.

Gu Ning stared straight at the woman who just booked the table before her. The woman was very beautiful, but she had bad physiognomy. Her face was skinny with prominent cheekbones and a sharp chin. There were also wrinkles in the middle of her eyebrows. Her physiognomy showed that she could be very unkind. Although physiognomy didn’t mean everything, Gu Ning knew that the woman was very aggressive, rude, and hot-tempered from her previous behavior.

“I’m sorry, miss, but we came here earlier than you,” Gu Ning said coldly.

“I didn’t hear you book it before me,” the woman said with disdain while looking at Gu Ning. Actually, this woman was Leng Shaojia.

Leng Shaojia was competing against Gu Ning for the table, not because she disliked Gu Ning, but because she was arrogant and self-centered. Besides, she was hungry now.

“It’s ridiculous! I just asked the waitress whether there are any vacant seats, and I was going to book the table, but you interrupted me!” Gu Ning said with annoyance.

“Miss, could you please wait for a while? Some diners are almost finished eating, and there will be more vacant seats,” the waitress said to Leng Shaojia.

“No, I want the last vacant table!” Leng Shaojia said without hesitation.
