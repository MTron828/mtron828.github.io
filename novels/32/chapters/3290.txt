3291 Do You Think I’m Easy to Bully?

She was a girl, so she wouldn’t make friends with guys for no reason. It was mostly based on networking.

Since it was a matter of connections, it was a mutually beneficial situation. They wouldn’t just go out for meals and chat when there was nothing to do.

Upon hearing that, both Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng were surprised. Had Leng Xiaoyao saved Ling Tianqi? And more than once?

Despite knowing that Leng Xiaoyao was skilled, they couldn’t help but worry. “How did you save him?”

“Some people caused him trouble, and I helped him beat them up,” said Leng Xiaoyao. She didn’t elaborate. It was fine if Leng Yecheng was aware of her skills of car racing and gambling, but she couldn’t let Leng Changyuan know.

“Did those people hurt you?” Leng Changyuan asked. Those who dared to attack Ling Tianqi would naturally not take the Leng family seriously, so he couldn’t help but worry.

“They don’t have the guts or the ability,” Leng Xiaoyao said confidently. They really didn’t have the guts or the ability. As a cultivator, she wasn’t afraid of ordinary people.

Leng Changyuan’s face turned cold and he scolded her, “Ordinary people may not be able to do anything to you, but there are many skilled people out there. Don’t be too arrogant and be careful.”

“Sure, I understand, grandpa.” Leng Xiaoyao obediently responded. She couldn’t tell them that she was a cultivator and how powerful she really was, so she had to humbly accept their advice.

…

Qin Wentao’s ability was limited. He couldn’t find evidence to prove that Qin Wenming framed him, nor could he find those people. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Although he wanted to secretly take action against Qin Wenming, he was afraid that his grandfather would find out and it would have an even greater impact.

Ling Tianqi waited for several days without any news from Qin Wentao. He knew that Qin Wentao couldn’t find anything, so he took the initiative to call Qin Wentao.

“Qin Wentao, it’s been many days already. How’s the situation on your end?” Ling Tianqi asked lazily, not getting angry despite the lack of news from Qin Wentao.

He did it in order to bother Qin Wentao. After all, he already had evidence that it was done by Qin Wenming, and he would take revenge himself.

“I haven’t found anything yet,” Qin Wentao said heavily. He was getting frustrated without any evidence.

“If you can’t find it. I can only report it to the police,” Ling Tianqi said resignedly.

“Ling Tianqi!” Qin Wentao immediately shouted, wanting to stop him but not knowing how.

“What?” asked Ling Tianqi.

“Why don’t you investigate yourself? It’s not me you should be targeting,” Qin Wentao said, feeling aggrieved. Although the incident started because of him, he didn’t do it.

“How do I know it’s not you? You haven’t found any evidence. If I have to investigate, I’ll have to report it to the police and let them help me investigate. After all, I’m the victim,” Ling Tianqi said.

“What do you want?” asked Qin Wentao in irritation.

“Qin Wentao, you need to understand that by telling you this instead of reporting it directly to the police, I’ve given you a chance. If you can’t find any evidence, you can find someone to beat up Qin Wenming and let this matter go,” Ling Tianqi said. He deliberately wanted them to fight each other because he knew about the situation in the Qin family.

“Ling Tianqi, you’re doing this on purpose…” Qin Wentao gritted his teeth in anger.

“So what? However, I’ll keep my word. I’ll give you two more days. If I don’t hear anything about Qin Wenming within two days, I’ll have to report it to the police,” Ling Tianqi said before hanging up.

Qin Wentao was so angry that he almost smashed his phone. He felt that Ling Tianqi was being too much.

However, he forgot that when he bullied Ling Tianqi, he wasn’t any better.

In fact, Ling Tianqi was already being kind enough to him. If Ling Tianqi did the same thing as him, he might rebel.

Sometimes, Qin Wentao thought about reporting to the police, since the mastermind behind the scenes wasn’t him anyway.

However, he was afraid that reporting would not only fail to uncover the true mastermind, but also incriminate himself.

Qin Wenming wasn’t doing any better than Qin Wentao. After all these days, Ling Tianqi hadn’t come looking for Qin Wentao, and those people couldn’t be contacted. He was very worried that something had been exposed.

Even though Qin Wentao didn’t seem to be acting suspiciously these days, he still felt that the current calm was like the calm before the storm.

After thinking all day, Qin Wentao finally decided to take action against Qin Wenming, but not by paying someone else. He was going to do it himself.

Qin Wentao was already an old hand at fighting, while Qin Wenming was weaker, so Qin Wenming wasn’t a match for Qin Wentao and ended up in pain.

“Qin Wentao, are you crazy? Why are you hitting me?” Qin Wenming angrily asked, but he lacked confidence because he thought that Qin Wentao must know something.

“Why am I hitting you? Don’t you know the reason?” Qin Wentao angrily retorted, hitting him harder.

“What evidence do you have to say it was me? Show me!” Qin Wenming demanded.

“I don’t have any evidence, but Ling Tianqi does. His friend is a hacker and they found out the truth. He simply told me first,” Qin Wentao said. It was just a lie he made up, but he accidentally pointed out the truth.

Qin Wentao had tried to hire a hacker to investigate it, but hackers weren’t easy to find and he didn’t know anyone who could find a hacker. As a result, he wasn’t able to.

This time he took a gamble, trusting Ling Tainqi’s words and giving Qin Wenming a beating.

“What?” Qin Wenming was surprised at the news that Ling Tianqi had hacker friends and had conducted an investigation.

Qin Wenming didn’t quite believe it, but he also felt that if it wasn’t true, Qin Wentao wouldn’t have dared to openly attack him at home. He would have been punished by their grandfather if he did.

“I didn’t plot against you, but you came to plot against me. Qin Wenming, do you think I’m easy to bully?” Qin Wentao said, with a sinister expression.

After a while, Qin Wentao finally stopped and threatened. “If you don’t want things to get worse, endure what happened today. Otherwise, I won’t let you off easy.”

Qin Wenming was seriously injured, with a broken rib, and needed to rest for a few days.

Qin Wenming was really afraid of Qin Wentao, so he didn’t tell his family.

Qin Wentao also suffered some minor injuries, but it wasn’t serious.

After beating Qin Wenming, he called Ling Tianqi and told him about what he had done so Ling Tianqi stopped making things difficult for him.
