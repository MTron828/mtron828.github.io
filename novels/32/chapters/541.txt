Chapter 543 Gu Man Finally Meets the Tang Family

Gu Man looked so much younger than her real age, and she looked like Gu Ning’s elder sister when they walked together.

“Girl Gu, hi!” Tang Haifeng welcomed them with excitement.

“Hi, grandpa and everyone, so sorry to keep you waiting,” Gu Ning said, then greeted them one by one. “This is my mother, Gu Man.”

“Nice to meet you!” They greeted Gu Man.

“Nice to meet you too,” Gu Man greeted them at once, but she felt very uneasy.

Afterwards, Gu Ning introduced the members of the Tang family to Gu Man.

“I’m so sorry for what you’ve experienced during the past years.” Tang Haifeng almost cried, apologizing to Gu Man with sincerity.

Gu Man was the younger generation when compared with Tang Haifeng, so Tang Haifeng felt like she was just like one of his children.

“Master Tang, please don’t say that.” Gu Man panicked a little when Tang Haifeng apologized to her with tears in his eyes. “I don’t feel aggrieved at all.”

Indeed, Gu Man didn’t feel aggrieved at all. She had been willing to give birth to Gu Ning because she loved Ning, who was Gu Ning’s father. She wouldn’t take Tang Yunfan as Ning and love him now exactly like she had loved Ning, because they were different in her eyes, so she needed time to get along with Tang Yunfan.

“I understand,” Tang Haifeng sighed and he seemed very sad. At that moment, Tang Yunhang interrupted them. “Alright, let’s get inside now. It’s very cold outside.”

“Oh, right. It is very cold outside. Let’s go inside!” Tang Haifeng immediately invited Gu Ning and Gu Man to walk into the house.

“Do you feel tired now after the flight? You can have a rest first before we go to see Yunfan together,” Tang Haifeng said. He was very considerate. Gu Ning and Gu Man followed his lead, and sat down on the sofa.

Seeing that Gu Man was very nervous, Jiang Lihua and Tang Yunrong chatted with her to help her relax. And after a while, Gu Man gradually relaxed.

Before long, Gu Ning received Leng Shaoting’s message, he had arrived at City B too. Gu Ning didn’t have time to meet him now, so he would take care of himself.

After sitting for half an hour in the living hall, Gu Ning and Gu Man followed Tang Haifeng to Tang Yunfan’s room. The others didn’t follow them, in case Gu Man would be nervous, and the room would be cramped if there were too many people.

Once they were in Tang Yunfan’s room, both Tang Haifeng and Gu Man seemed very sad.

“Please don’t be too stressed. Just do you what can you, and it’ll be enough,” Tang Haifeng said to Gu Man.

“I will,” Gu Man replied but still felt a little stressed.

Tang Haifeng then left the room, in case Gu Man would feel uneasy if he was there.

“Ningning, what should I say?” Gu Man asked Gu Ning.

Gu Ning thought for a while then said, “You can talk to him about something that happened after you met each other and what you’ve been through when he suddenly disappeared. Let him know that you’ve lived a hard life, so that he’ll feel guilty and wake up.”

Even though it was painful for Gu Man to uncover her mental scars, if Tang Yunfan could wake up or regain his memory, it would be worth doing it. In addition, it was Gu Man’s choice to come here, and she was ready for it.

Gu Ning then walked downstairs, and left Gu Man alone in the room.

In the living hall, Tang Haifeng, Tang Yunhang and Cao Ruihua were there together, while Tang Yunrong, Jiang Lihua along with a domestic servant were busing preparing dinner in the kitchen.

Both Tang Yunrong and Jiang Lihua were from super-rich families, and they had never done housework before, but they had learned to do some ever since they had gotten married.

“Girl Gu, I used to wish that you could be a member of our family because you resemble Yunfan a lot. Unexpectedly, you are!” Tang Haifeng said when Gu Ning walked to them. He still felt that it was very unreal, because he was so afraid that it was just a dream.

Gu Ning could sense Tang Haifeng’s sincerity, and she smiled. “In fact, I had the same thought when you mentioned Uncle Tang back in City Teng, so I investigated. I was sure back then that Uncle Tang could be my biological father, but Uncle Tang had lost his memory about my mother, so I didn’t tell anyone about it. Instead, I decided to wait for a good time to bring it up. However, when I came to the Tang family’s house for the first time, Uncle Tang was affected and investigated later. I bet you all already know the things that happened after. Please forgive me for secretly investigating Uncle Tang and because I didn’t tell you the truth at the very beginning.”

When everyone heard that Gu Ning had already found out when they had been in City Teng, they were all shocked.

Cao Ruihua and Tang Yunhang had suspected that Gu Ning approached the Tang family on purpose before, but it was quite a surprise for them that Gu Ning actually was one of their family members.

“Of course we won’t blame you! Although I do feel that it was a shame that you didn’t tell us at the very beginning, I understand your decision,” Tang Haifeng said. It also proved that Gu Ning did not maintain a close relationship with them for money. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Gu Ning knew Tang Haifeng wouldn’t blame her, but she wouldn’t feel relieved until he said it in person.

“Oh, we’re prepared some clothes for you and your mother in the car in case you didn’t bring a change of clothes with you, and you can take them back to your house tonight. If you don’t like them, you can go shopping at Fengshang Shopping Mall when you’re free,” Tang Haifeng said

Gu Ning was surprised that Tang Haifeng was so considerate and she accepted it. “Thanks, grandpa.”

“Ha-ha, we’re a family after all,” Tang Haifeng said. Although Gu Ning and Tang Yunfan hadn’t accepted each other as family yet, Tang Haifeng had already accepted Gu Ning as his biological granddaughter.

Gu Ning smiled, and her silence showed her willingness to join the Tang family as their new family member.
