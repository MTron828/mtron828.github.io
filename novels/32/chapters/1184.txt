Chapter 1185 1 Vs. 5

Gu Ning pulled her lips and ignored him, then she turned to the leader of the Bulls. “Hey, your teammate just lost. Do five of you want to play against me?”Gu Ning’s expression and tone were full of provocation.“Sure, five of us will play together against you!” the leader of the Bulls said in anger. All he wanted to do now was to defeat Gu Ning.

Those who trusted Gu Ning still believed that she could win, but some were worried about her.

“Can she still win the game?”

“I don’t think she can. It’s not a fair game at all.”

“The five of them are all professional basketball players. I think she’ll lose this time.”

“Well, the girl looks confident. Maybe she can win.”

“...”

“Ningning will win!” Tang Jiakai said in a low voice, because he couldn’t let others know that he was Gu Ning’s friend.

“How to judge the competition?” the leader of the Bulls asked.

“We can judge on the amount of baskets we score within 15 minutes,” Gu Ning said.

“No problem.” The leader of the Bulls agreed.

After that, the leader and four other members of the Bulls stepped on the court.

Although the leader of the Bulls still refused to believe that Gu Ning was better than them, he joined the game in case any accidents happened.

The judge stood in the middle line of the court, and Gu Ning along with five members of the Bulls stood by his sides. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Gu Ning seemed to be too short and weak when she stood across from the five tall and strong men.

At this moment, several basketball coaches walked out, they were attracted by the scene and walked over.

Once they approached, the judge whistled and threw the ball up in the air. The leader of the Bulls jumped at once trying to hit the ball into his teammates’ hands.

Gu Ning was playing alone, so she could directly grab the ball away.

Because of what had happened to Lao Er, the leader of the Bulls didn’t dare to take Gu Ning lightly. However, Gu Ning still moved a second earlier than him and grabbed the ball away.

Those basketball coaches were greatly surprised by the scene. They had never seen a girl who could move so swiftly and jump so high before.

The leader of the Bulls was nearly 1.9 m tall, and Gu Ning was only 1.65m. There was a huge height gap between them.

The members of the Bulls were mad, and they began to surround Gu Ning to stop her from scoring again.

It wasn’t easy for Gu Ning to successfully throw a ball into the hoop facing five professional basketball players on the court, but her aim wasn’t to score this time. Instead, she planned to injure them without anyone knowing.

Therefore, Gu Ning wasn’t eager to throw the ball, nor did she avoid them right away.

She was very knowledgeable about a person’s acupoints, and she also knew how to hurt them by hitting these acupoints.

Within a short time, Gu Ning hurt two members of the Bulls by secretly hitting their acupoints.

The two members of the Bulls felt sudden pain and stopped at once, but they had no idea what had happened.

It was unavoidable to touch or knock into another person’s body in a basketball game, so the audience didn’t think too much about it.

Afterwards, Gu Ning seized the chance and threw the ball into the hoop.

The Bulls failed to stop her.

The audience loudly cheered and applauded.

Those basketball coaches were amazed too.

“Did the girl just score a basket when she was surrounded by five professional male basketball players?”

“Right, and the Bulls rank second in this year’s basketball competition, but it can’t defeat a young girl.”

The coach of the Bulls was displeased and argued. “I don’t think other basketball teams can defeat this girl either. It’s obvious that this girl isn’t simple at all.”

Although he agreed that it was very embarrassing that five members of the Bulls failed to win the match against a young girl, he didn’t think other professional basketball players could defeat Gu Ning either.

They were basketball coaches and they could see Gu Ning’s unbelievable skills. At the same time, they were also curious about the reason why Gu Ning could so easily score a basket.

“Is this girl a member of the women’s national basketball team?” A coach guessed.

Although Gu Ning wasn’t tall enough, her skills mattered most. Since she could easily score a basket when she was surrounded by five professional male basketball players, she couldn’t just be a basketball lover.

“I think this girl might be excellent at kung fu, so she’s able to move so quickly,” another coach said.

If she was a kung fu master, it would be reasonable for her to be able to win the game.
