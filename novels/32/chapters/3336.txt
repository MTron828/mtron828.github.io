3339 We’re Going Out!

“They made things difficult for us,” said Leng Xiaoyao.

“I just came over to have a drink with them,” the man said, feeling nothing wrong about it.

“We refused. Then you insulted us, and even tried to throw drinks on my friend. Don’t we have the right to refuse? Who do you think you are?” said Leng Xiaoyao.

“You…” The man was furious. “But now I’m the one who got splashed with drinks.”

“If you didn’t pour drinks on yourself, would I resist? It’s your own fault. We came here to drink and chat, not to cause trouble for you. We were harassed and provoked in the bar. I don’t know if the bar will take responsibility. If they won’t, I’ll have to call the police. I don’t want to make things difficult for you. I just want this matter to end and for them not to bother us while we are drinking,” said Leng Xiaoyao. After all, they weren’t the ones who suffered losses, so she had nothing to pursue.

“Of course.” The manager quickly replied. The bar had a responsibility when something happened in it. Because a waiter saw what happened, the manager naturally knew what was going on. “Sir, why don’t you go to another table?”

Those men were unwilling, but they didn’t want to cause trouble at the police station, so they reluctantly agreed.

However, before leaving, they glared at Leng Xiaoyao fiercely and threatened her. “Let’s wait and see! Don’t you dare leave this bar!”

He didn’t finish, but the meaning was already very clear.

Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t afraid and responded arrogantly, “Great! I’ll be leaving the bar at around 11 pm. If I don’t see you outside, you’re just garbage and cowards.”

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to cause a scene, but she was left with no choice. In that case, she decided to challenge them.

“You…” Those men wanted to beat her right there, but their reason stopped them.

Although Leng Xiaoyao was so arrogant, they didn’t think that she had the ability to confront them. They thought that Leng Xiaoyao just didn’t know how powerful they were.

They could see that Leng Xiaoyao had some skills, so they naturally wouldn’t come alone. They would call a few more friends over.

“Call Liu Laosan and his four friends and tell them to come here. Tonight, I must teach this woman a lesson,” said the man who was splashed with the drinks, his eyes full of malice.

“Okay, I’ll call Liu Laosan right away.” Another man replied and quickly made the call.

Meanwhile, Leng Xiaoyao called Li Mochen.

Although she didn’t care about these people, they would definitely call for backup. When they arrived, there might be a risk of someone hurting An Chenmeng and her friends.

Since she took them out to play, she naturally had to ensure their safety.

Xiong Manxin had seen the fight between Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mocheng before. She knew that Leng Xiaoyao was very powerful. Therefore, even if Leng Xiaoyao didn’t call Li Mocheng, she had nothing to worry about.

However, An Chenmeng and her friends had never seen it before, so even if they knew that Leng Xiaoyao was skilled, they didn’t know how skilled she was or if she could beat them.

Therefore, when they saw Leng Xiaoyao call Li Mochen, they were relieved.

“Don’t worry, it’ll be fine. Only they will get in trouble. We can continue to enjoy ourselves, but don’t drink too much.” Leng Xiaoyao comforted them.

The other girls relaxed and continued to drink and eat.

It was about 9:30 pm, so Li Mochen arrived at 10 pm.

He knew that Leng Xiaoyao was powerful, but when he heard that they got in trouble at the bar, he still felt nervous.

Seeing her safe and sound, he was finally relieved.

“Girls, you should come to the bar less often in the future. Although not all bars are chaotic, or encounter such people all the time, there is still danger after all.” Li Mochen kindly reminded them.

“Okay! I know, I won’t dare to come again in the future.” Xiong Manxin patted her chest and was really scared this time.

“I’ve been to a few bars and clubs before with my older brother, so I’ve never run into anything like this before. I’m not afraid. It seems that these people only hit on girls who are not with boys. It’s better to have boys around even if we want to go in the future,” An Chenmeng said.

“It also depends on what kind of boys they are. There is no problem with family members, but sometimes you also need to be wary of classmates and friends. Some people will target acquaintances,” Leng Xiaoyao warned.

Everyone nodded in agreement.

It was true that even with classmates and friends, it might not always be safe. Wasn’t there a piece of news recently about a girl who went drinking with a male colleague and was then raped by him?

Because they didn’t care about those people, they ate and drank as they pleased, except for Li Mochen who had to drive and couldn’t drink.

Those men occasionally glanced over at Leng Xiaoyao to prevent them from leaving secretly or calling someone over.

They didn’t leave secretly, but they did call someone over, just one person. Those men didn’t care because they had four more people coming over!

It was already 11 pm, so Leng Xiaoyao and the others got up to leave.

Li Mochen walked in the front, An Chenmeng and the others walked in the middle, while Leng Xiaoyao walked in the back. She was protecting them.

When they were leaving, Leng Xiaoyao went to the table of those men and reminded them arrogantly. “Hey, we’re leaving!”

Those men were so angry that they almost couldn’t hold back. This woman was too arrogant.

They also got up immediately when she left.

As soon as they left the bar, nine men surrounded Leng Xiaoyao and the others.

“Huh! You’re so arrogant. Let’s see what you can do now.” The man who was splashed with the wine snorted coldly. Because they had more people, they weren’t worried about Leng Xiaoyao and the others at all.

“That should be what I’m saying to you.” Leng Xiaoyao smiled lazily and said indifferently.

“You…” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Don’t waste time arguing. Just come at us if you have any skills!” Leng Xiaoyao impatiently interrupted. She hated dragging things out.

Her words angered them greatly, so they didn’t say anything more and attacked them directly.

An Chenmeng and the others followed Leng Xiaoyao’s instructions and stood in the middle without moving, so nothing happened. Although they were a little panicked, they obediently didn’t move.

Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen almost knocked down one person per second. From start to finish, it only took five seconds. Li Mochen knocked down five people, while Leng Xiaoyao knocked down four.

Onlookers thought that there would be a fierce battle! They immediately hid far away, but before they could hide properly, the fight was already over.

Those men, who were knocked down, were completely stunned. They didn’t expect them to be so powerful.
