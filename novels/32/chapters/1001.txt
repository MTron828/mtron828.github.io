Chapter 1002 Levels of One“s Inner Discipline

The man of the Evil Practice wasn’t a normal human being after all, so he was able to see Gu Ning more clearly than Leng Shaoting. In addition, he moved faster than Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning with the help of her Jade Eyes, could clearly see where the man was and she swam freely like a fish in the water.

When Gu Ning caught the man, she was already a long distance away from Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting was a little anxious, but couldn’t touch Gu Ning at all.

The man was shocked by Gu Ning’s agile movements. He had thought that it would be easier for him to defeat Gu Ning in the water. So to his astonishment, things went the opposite way.

He realized that he had taken Gu Ning lightly, and that this girl was totally beyond his imagination.

The three of them had stayed in the water for a long time.

Gu Ning was worried that Leng Shaoting’s life might be in danger, so she let the jiao out and gave an order. “Catch the man.”

“Sure,” the jiao said and attacked the man at once. Gu Ning, at the same time, swam back to Leng Shaoting.

The man was stunned the moment he saw the jiao. As a member of the Evil Practice, he was aware that ghosts and monsters really existed, but he was surprised to see the jiao appear by the girl’s side within a second.

How is it possible? The man couldn’t figure it out.

Gu Ning met Leng Shaoting in the water a few seconds later. Leng Shaoting wasn’t relieved until he touched her again, but he was still worried about her and hugged her at once.

Gu Ning understood that Leng Shaoting was worried about her, but she had to push him up right now.

Leng Shaoting was almost out of air now, and he was worried that Gu Ning might also be out of breath, so he pulled Gu Ning while swimming upwards. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Once they were out of the water, Leng Shaoting hugged Gu Ning tightly before they were even onboard. “Ningning, are you alright?”

“Don’t worry, I’m fine,” Gu Ning said.

“Really?” Leng Shaoting asked her again with concern.

“Relax, I’m really fine,” Gu Ning said with a smile.

“Great, great.” Leng Shaoting was quite nervous.

The jiao was fighting against the man in the water, so they kept making violent waves, which pushed Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning meters away. If it went on like that, they might cause damage to other innocent people.

The problem was that the jiao was super destructive, and it was able to cause a tsunami if it used all of its force.

Therefore, Gu Ning had to get rid of Leng Shaoting right now. “Shaoting, please trust me and get back on the boat right now. I need to handle it well, or it might become uncontrollable.”

“I’ll go with you,” Leng Shaoting said.

“No, Shaoting, there is something I can’t tell you right now, but I promise I’ll be fine.” Gu Ning comforted Leng Shaoting.

Even though Leng Shaoting was unwilling to leave her alone, he had to agree with it. He kissed her and said, “Be careful.”

“I will,” Gu Ning said, then got into the water again. She swam straight towards the man and the jiao, while Leng Shaoting listened to her and got back on the pleasure boat.

...

In fact, there was no need for Gu Ning to be so worried, because the man was only at the fourth level of his inner discipline.

The fourth level belonged to the middle rank of one’s inner discipline.

The levels of one’s inner discipline could be divided into four ranks, and each rank consisted of three levels.

There were 12 levels in all. The first to the third level was junior rank; the fourth to the sixth level was middle rank; the seventh to the ninth level was senior rank, and the tenth to the twelfth level was the top rank.

If one could reach the twelfth level, he or she could become a god or goddess.

Nevertheless, it was super hard to do that nowadays, because the magical power was very rare.

Gu Ning read the above information from the Internet, and she wasn’t sure whether it was right. Therefore, she had to get to know more details about it in real life.

People who were practicing their inner discipline were totally different from normal human beings, and they could easily beat a normal human being in a fight.

They didn’t rely on physical strength after all.

Since the man was just at the fourth level, he couldn’t defeat Gu Ning, let alone the jiao.

Even Gu Ning wasn’t confident that she could control the jiao without her Jade Eyes.

That being the case, the jiao twisted its body around the man within minutes.

Although the jiao was greedy for the man’s inner discipline, it didn’t dare to swallow him before Gu Ning gave the order.

...

The man was indeed unusually good at swimming, because he wasn’t affected after staying in the water for over 10 minutes.
