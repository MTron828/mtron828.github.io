Chapter 365 Gu Qingyun

Moreover, a hundred thousand yuan was a fortune in Yu Mixi’s eyes, so she didn’t have the courage to gamble.

“Relax, we won’t lose. Normally, I wouldn’t encourage you all to gamble, but this time is a great chance to make money. Don’t worry, I’ll bear the result,” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning was generous, but she wasn’t dumb, and she knew when the right time to spend her money was.

“Exactly, Mixi, let’s listen to our boss this time!” Everyone persuaded Yu Mixi to join them, so she agreed in the end, although she was extremely nervous.

The kickboxing match wouldn’t begin until 10 pm, and it was only 8:30 pm. Thus they enjoyed eating, drinking and chatting while waiting for the match.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya wouldn’t drink alcohol; they only drank fruit juice. Yu Mixi, on the other hand, joined the others in drinking alcohol.

...

In the Gu Family’s house... They were watching TV in the living room, including the old lady, Lin Lijuan, Gu Xiaoxiao and Gu Qingyun who just came back from the capital.

Gu Qingyun was a good-looking young boy to some extent. However, when he lay against the sofa, placing his feet on the coffee table, playing online games while swearing, he looked like a bad boy without manners.

It wasn’t uncommon to see a male swearing, but it was impolite to do it in front of females, like his grandmother, mother and younger sister. However, they were all used to it. Sometimes, Gu Qinxiang criticized Gu Qingyun for his rude behavior, but the old lady would argue for Gu Qingyun.

Gu Qingyun was the eldest grandson in the Gu Family, so the old lady always spoiled him. That being the case, Gu Qingyun was spoiled even more rotten than Gu Xiaoxiao. And he was often involved in fights and trouble.

He had now grown older and more mature than before, but he inherited many negative characteristics from his family. For example, he was as selfish as his family. If anyone affected or hurt his own benefits, he would do anything to get revenge without thinking about the results. In his eyes, only his grandmother, parents and younger sister was his family. And he only protected and cared about his own family.

When he came back home from his college for winter vacation, he heard that Gu Ning had slapped Gu Xiaoxiao and had even forced her to transfer. Gu Qingyun was mad and wanted to teach Gu Ning a lesson right away. However, they didn’t know Gu Ning’s address, nor phone number, so he had to wait until they gathered together at the family reunion.

Gu Qinxiang went back home in a bad mood, but Gu Qingyun wouldn’t stop swearing in front of him. “Shut your mouth! Or go back to your room!” Gu Qinxiang snapped. It was the first time that Gu Qinxiang had gotten so mad at Gu Qingyun. Gu Qingyun and the others were scared dumb.

“Qinxiang, what is wrong with you!” Gu Qinxiang’s mother, the old lady, was displeased.

“What’s wrong with me? Do you know who I met today? Jiang Xu! Do you know what his title is now? He’s the boss of Xuri Construction Material Store! He now has dozens of millions of yuan and a Mercedes-Benz!” Gu Qinxiang said angrily.

“What?” Hearing that, everyone rounded their eyes in shock. In their eyes it was impossible for Jiang Xu to own dozens of millions of yuan and drive a Mercedes-Benz.

“Where did he get so much money to run his business?” Lin Lijuan asked. Her face was distorted in jealousy. She was so used to being better than them, but now everything suddenly changed.

Gu Man and Gu Qing had a beauty salon with millions of yuan in assets, and Jiang Xu was now the boss of a construction material store with a wealth of dozens of millions of yuan. How come her poor relatives became so rich overnight?

“I think that Mrs. Hao lent them money,” Gu Qinxiang said. The Hao Family had thousands of millions of yuan in assets, so ten million yuan was nothing to them.

Lin Lijuan was jealous again, because Mrs. Hao never showed any respect towards her, but treated Gu Qing and Gu Man as her close friends.

“How could they do that! Gu Qing and Gu Man are both rich now, so they should share their money with me. I’m their biological mother!” The old lady was in a rage. She never stopped trying to snatch money from her two daughters. And now the old lady found out Jiang Xu had dozens of millions of yuan in assets. She couldn’t wait to share the wealth even though it had nothing to do with her.

Gu Qingyun and Gu Xiaoxiao didn’t think that Jiang Xu’s and Gu Man’s wealth was theirs, but they were also displeased that their poor relatives became rich all of a sudden.

“Other than that, he’s my client’s friend. I wanted him to help me get the deal, but he rejected me!” Gu Qinxiang took it for granted that Jiang Xu should help him to settle the deal with Quan Wenfeng.

“What? How dare he do that!” the old lady almost shouted. “It’s insane! Let me call him right now.” Saying that, the old lady took out her phone, but was stopped by Gu Qinxiang. “Mom, please don’t get involved in this. If he gets annoyed and bad-mouths me in front of my client, it’ll be hopeless for me to settle the deal.”

“He wouldn’t dare!” The old lady was furious.

“It’s possible. Gu Ning ruined dad’s deal last time, didn’t she?” Gu Xiaoxiao said. She still believed that it was Gu Ning’s fault and never felt guilty for her actions.

“What? Gu Ning ruined dad’s deal? I think that I need to beat her sometime!” Gu Qingyun was mad, and made up his mind to punch Gu Ning. Gu Qingyun wasn’t a gentleman at all, and he would beat females as always. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In fact, Gu Qinxiang knew that it was the fact that his company’s proposal wasn’t good enough, but he was reluctant to admit it, so he could only blame Gu Ning for his own failure.

“What should we do now? What if Jiang Xu ruins your deal this time too?” Lin Lijuan was worried.

“I don’t know,” Gu Qinxiang replied. He lost his patience. If he knew the answer, he wouldn’t be so anxious. Because of the shocking news about Jiang Xu, Gu Qinxiang’s family had a terrible day. Even though Gu Qinxiang wouldn’t allow his mother to call Jiang Xu, the old lady still called Gu Qinyang and kept complaining.

Gu Qinyang was also amazed by the news, but he had already learnt his lesson after Gu Ning’s warning last time.
