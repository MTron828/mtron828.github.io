Chapter 625 Goddess Su

Gu Ning was starving and enjoyed the meal without hesitation. Leng Shaoting began to eat as well, and put a lot of food into Gu Ning’s bowl. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

When Gu Ning was almost full, she slowed down and said, “I met Master Jiang, Master Xu and your grandpa at the antique street yesterday.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was surprised and panicked a little.

“And?” Leng Shaoting asked. Actually, he wanted to ask whether his grandpa had recognized Gu Ning, but he was afraid that Gu Ning might find out that he already told his grandpa that he had a girlfriend.

Gu Ning didn’t notice anything unusual with Leng Shaoting, and said, “They bought some real antiques at my store. I didn’t want to charge them at the beginning, but they weren’t willing to take them for free, so I told them to pay me a hundred thousand yuan each.”

Leng Shaoting nodded.

“Oh, how is Uncle Tang now?” he asked with concern.

“He’s awake now,” Gu Ning said.

“Glad to know that!” Leng Shaoting was relieved. If Tang Yunfan couldn’t wake up, Gu Ning and Gu Man wouldn’t live a happy life.

“What’s your plan today?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“The flagship store of Colaine is going to open tomorrow, so I want to have a look at the products today,” Gu Ning said.

“I’ll go with you,” Leng Shaoting said.

After the meal, Leng Shaoting told Gu Ning to have a rest, and he went to wash dishes himself.

“Well, it’s really good to have a boyfriend who’s good at cooking and housework, so that I can eat and sleep well,” Gu Ning said and complimented Leng Shaoting.

“Eat well, and you can sleep well!” Leng Shaoting said and the stress was on the word of sleep.

Gu Ning flushed and ignored Leng Shaoting, walking upstairs. She went back to the bedroom and checked her phone. There was a missed call from Xu Qinyin, so she called her back at once.

The moment Xu Qinyin answered Gu Ning’s call, she was very excited. “Gu Ning, the skincare products you sent me are so-so good! I’ve never used such a set of effective products before. My skin is very smooth and shiny now!” Women all cared about their appearances.

“Oh, my mother even wanted to steal the set from me, but she failed. Ha-ha!” Xu Qinyin said with great pride.

It seemed that Xu Qinyin’s mother also became a loyal customer of Gu Ning’s skincare products now.

Hearing the good news, Gu Ning smiled with satisfaction. She was confident that her products would soon be popular!

“When will your skincare products be put on the market? My mother wants it so badly,” Xu Qinyin asked.

“Tomorrow,” Gu Ning said. “There are also many new products, and you can go to the flagship store tomorrow.”

In fact, Gu Ning could send Xu Qinyin’s mother a set, but she didn’t do that because her store would be opening tomorrow and it needed popularity.

“Where? Where?” Xu Qinyin asked with excitement.

“No.168, XX Road, downtown. Don’t forget to go there along with your mother!” Gu Ning said.

“Of course I won’t! I’ll tell my mother right now,” Xu Qinyin said then hung up, and went to tell her mother the exciting news. Her mother called several female friends at once, and they decided that they would go there tomorrow together.

Xu Qinyin’s mother had no intention to promote Gu Ning’s brand, because she didn’t know Gu Ning anyway, but she simply thought that the products were quite good, so she recommended it to her friends.

Xu Qinyin called Gu Anna later as well, and invited her to go with her. Gu Anna cared more about skincare products than Xu Qinyin, so she absolutely wouldn’t miss it. Even if not for the skincare products, they were Gu Ning’s friends, and should go to congratulate Gu Ning tomorrow.

After washing dishes, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning left home together.

At the same time, a piece of news went viral. It was about the ads of Jade Beauty Jewelry and Charm.

Su Tongnuo was a beauty herself, and she looked even more stunning in the photos and video ad after K’s editing. No matter if it was a photo or video ad, it was very attractive.

Su Tongnuo dressed in three different styles in the posters and video ad. She was as pure as a flower fairy, as elegant as a noblewoman, and as powerful as a queen. She looked perfect with the jade jewelry.

“Wow! She’s a pure goddess!”

“I’m in love with her now.”

“She’s so stunning, so is the jade jewelry!”

“The posters make me want to buy all of them, but I’m too poor to afford that.”

“Ha-ha, ha-ha.”

Once the posters and the video ad were out, the number of Su Tongnuo’s followers on social media rapidly increased.

At the same time, many people were impressed by the high level of the ad. Therefore, the ad attracted more and more attention, and soon became the hottest topic on Weibo. Once it became popular, haters couldn’t remain silent anymore.

“I think she only looks good because of her delicate make-up and the retoucher’s outstanding skills.”

“I don’t like her. She looks like a calculating bitch.”

Seeing the above comments, Su Tongnuo’s fans got mad.

“Haters! Couldn’t you focus more on yourself?”
