Chapter 529 I’ll Give You a Chance to Get Revenge

“Very well. I’m curious how you’ll win it back! However, don’t cry if you lose!” Ai Weishun laughed. He wouldn’t refuse to have several rounds with Gu Ning and he was curious to see how she would win the game.

“Of course not.” Gu Ning smiled with confidence then shook the dice cup. The dice knocked around in the dice cup, making clear sounds. When Gu Ning laid the dice cup on the table with a loud sound, she looked to Ai Weishun with a broad smile. “Big or small?”

Since Ai Weishun regarded her as his friend, she would treat him as her friend as well, and didn’t bother to obey manners.

“Big,” Ai Weishun guessed with obvious confidence.

After that, Gu Ning opened the dice cup. The total score exceeded 11, which was big, and Ai Weishun was right.

Ai Weishun wore a satisfied smile looking to Gu Ning, but Gu Ning didn’t care.

Even though he was right, it was impossible that Gu Ning would lose with her Jade Eyes. It wasn’t an equal game but Ai Weishun had no idea. Although it seemed unfair if Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes, she wasn’t harming people, she just wanted to win the game and make Ai Weishun drink more cups of alcohol.

“My turn now!” Ai Weishun smiled then shook the dice cup. After a while, he put it back on the table. “Big or small,” he said to Gu Ning.

“Small,” Gu Ning replied.

The dice cup was opened, and the total score was below 11, which was small, so this was an even round.

After that, Gu Ning guessed right every time. However, Ai Weishun was wrong sometimes.

Sic Bo, or big and small, was an unequal game of chance played with three dice, so it was normal that someone who was lucky could be right many times, while someone who wasn’t that lucky could be wrong often.

As the game went on, Ai Weishun finally felt that something had to be wrong.

They had played 10 rounds in all. Five were even rounds, and Ai Weishun lost another five rounds, while Gu Ning had never lost once, which was a shocking result.

Everyone was astonished, except for Leng Shaoting who seemed very proud and curious at the same time. How was it possible that Gu Ning won every time? Even if she was lucky, she might lose at least once!

“It’s crazy that you haven’t lost once!” Ai Weishun couldn’t believe the result.

“You don’t believe it? I can give you a chance to get revenge,” Gu Ning said and challenged him.

“Sure. Let’s continue for another five rounds! I don’t believe that I’ll lose again,” Ai Weishun said and accepted the challenge. However, when another five rounds were finished, Gu Ning still hadn’t lost once.

“Fine, I give up.” Ai Weishun gave up, because he knew that he couldn’t win no matter how many rounds he kept playing with Gu Ning.

After drinking several successive cups of alcohol, Ai Weishun felt a little uncomfortable.

“Let me try!” Although Zhao Lang had witnessed the whole process, he didn’t believe that Gu Ning could be that lucky, so he challenged her.

Gu Ning, of course, wouldn’t reject. If they wanted to drink, she wound let them have enough! After seven rounds, Zhao Lang gave up because he had lost more rounds than Ai Weishun, and had to drink five successive cups of alcohol.

“Alright, I give up.”

Actually, Ai Weichen had the idea to challenge Gu Ning too, but both Ai Weishun and Zhao Lang had lost and drank a lot of alcohol afterwards. He had no doubt that he could “win” more cups than them.

“How did you do it? Either it was an even round, or you won it,” Zhao Lang asked.

“Well, I can figure out the total score by hearing the sounds of dice knocking against each other in the dice cup,” Gu Ning said. She was lying, because she couldn’t tell them the truth.

They had heard before that some people, especially the god of gamblers, had the ability to make judgments by hearing the dice sound, so they didn’t think that Gu Ning was lying. Instead, they all admired Gu Ning now.

Leng Shaoting didn’t stay there with them for long and left with Gu Ning around 11 pm. The others didn’t play too late either and left soon.

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning went straight to the Huangdeng Hotel.

Although Leng Shaoting seemed calm as usual, he actually couldn’t wait a second longer, and wanted to arrive at the hotel as soon as possible. That being the case; he drove much faster than usual.

Gu Ning understood what was on his mind, and was amused. “Do you want to eat something first?”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was a little displeased. Obviously, he was reluctant to waste time on the road, but he was worried that Gu Ning was hungry so he asked, “Are you hungry?”

Seeing Leng Shaoting’s reaction, Gu Ning laughed.

“I’m not. I was just worried that you are hungry,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was relieved then he said with an amorous smile, “Well, I am hungry, but food can’t satisfy me.”

“You...” Gu Ning blushed at once.

Leng Shaoting laughed this time; he enjoyed seeing Gu Ning blush. Gu Ning, on the other hand, was regretful now.

Finally, they arrived at the hotel. Once the door was closed behind them, Leng Shaoting pressed her against the wall and kissed her, while his hand moved upward to the familiar soft place.

Gu Ning had her magical power to protect herself, so she didn’t wear much clothing in winter, so she couldn’t help but give a moan of sexual pleasure when Leng Shaoting’s hand touched her skin.

Leng Shaoting lifted Gu Ning up, quickly walking to the bedroom. Without hesitation, Leng Shaoting undressed himself and Gu Ning when they were both on the bed. Gu Ning felt shy looking at Leng Shaoting, waiting for his next movements. Leng Shaoting, however, became a little rude and violent after having restricted himself for so many days.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
