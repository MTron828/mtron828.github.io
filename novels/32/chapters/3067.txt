3069 How Could I Know? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Mu Yiyang didn’t come back to his senses until he heard Si Yiqi’s words. Then he walked over and sat next to Si Yiqi.

Obviously, Li Mochen accepted it when Leng Xiaoyao sat by him, but why? Mu Yiyang was curious about it, but it wasn’t the right time to ask, so he had to wait till they finished the meal.

The others didn’t know Li Mochen’s habits, so they didn’t think much about it.

After they all sat down, Leng Xiaoyao introduced Ling Tianqi and the others to Mu Yiyang, but she only gave their names, not their backgrounds. They were acquaintances, so it wasn’t necessary to do a detailed introduction.

!!

Even if Mu Yiyang had a high status, he wasn’t arrogant, so he wouldn’t take them lightly just because their status was lower than his. That was his way.

In addition, there were no grudges among them. Instead, they had gone to the battlefield together…

Because Mu Yiyang and his friends were important figures, Ling Tianqi and the others talked to them very politely during the meal.

“Leng Xiaoyao, do you know how mean Mochen is? I told him I want to meet you and asked him whether he has your phone number. He told me he doesn’t know you and refused to give me your phone number. Yiqi pointed it out, and he said he simply didn’t want to give me your phone number. I was so mad! He must think that I have bad intentions towards you. Luckily, fate brought us together, but you’re too young, otherwise I would drink with you,” Mu Yiyang said. He embarrassed Li Mochen publicly, but it wasn’t a big deal.

“Well, I’m sure Brother Mochen simply doesn’t want me to be bothered. He did it for my good,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Hearing that, Mu Yiyang was struck dumb for a moment. It seemed he shouldn’t have said that. After all, Leng Xiaoyao sided with Li Mochen!

“I’m suddenly so upset,” Mu Yiyang said, acting uncomfortable.

“You asked for it,” Si Yiqi replied. He was uncomfortable too just then.

After the meal, they separated.

Because Mu Yiyang and the others were leaving, they asked Leng Xiaoyao where she was going and whether they could give her a ride.

“I need to go to the No.3 Hospital. If it’s convenient, can you drive me there? If it’s too far, then don’t bother,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She needed to check on Leng Yecheng’s condition.

“Get in. I’m going to Yufeng.” As soon as Leng Xiaoyao finished, Li Mochen opened his mouth.

Li Mochen indeed needed to go to Yufeng Technology. He didn’t deliberately seize the chance to drive Leng Xiaoyao home. After all, they weren’t so familiar.

Upon hearing the name Yufeng, Leng Xiaoyao blinked, because she had hacked into its system not long ago. Unexpectedly, Li Mochen had a relationship with Yufeng.

“Thanks!”

Since Li Mochen said that, the others didn’t compete with him. After all, he was simply being kind.

However, Mu Yiyang felt it was a little strange. Even if Li Mochen was going in the same direction, he felt uncomfortable when Leng Xiaoyao got in Li Mochen’s car.

After that, Li Mochen drove Leng Xiaoyao away.

Mu Yiyang asked Si Yiqi, “Yiqi, what’s going on between them? Why do I feel Mochen treats Leng Xiaoyao differently? If Leng Xiaoyao was a sexy and beautiful woman, he might be interested in her, but Leng Xiaoyao… She has fine features, and can be pretty with make-up, but she’s a high school student right now. I don’t think it’s right if Mochen has interest in her.”

“I don’t know. Why don’t you ask Mochen about it? Or do you need me to pass your words to him?” Si Yiqi asked. He was curious about it too, but didn’t dare to ask Li Mochen about it. Honestly, he didn’t think Li Mochen would tell him.

“Why do you want to harm me?” Mu Yiyang was scared and asked angrily.

“Then why did you ask me? How could I know?” Si Yiqi rolled his eyes. Then he ignored Mu Yiyang and walked away.

Mu Yiyang was annoyed, but he knew both of them were curious. However, neither of them dared to ask Li Mochen about it.

At the same time, Leng Xiaoyao asked Li Mochen, “Brother Mochen, did you invest in Yufeng Technology?”

“Yes.” Li Mochen answered.

“Um, I need to be honest with you about one thing,” Leng Xiaoyao said with slight embarrassment. She wanted to tell Li Mochen that she had hacked into the system of Yufeng Technology. She decided to do that because she guessed that Li Mochen should already know.

Since Li Mochen had a relationship with Yufeng Technology, she would be relaxed after telling him the truth.

If she didn’t know about Li Mochen’s relationship with Yufeng, it would be fine, but she felt guilty after finding out about it.

Li Mochen understood what she wanted to tell him, but he didn’t point it out. He simply asked, “What is it?”

“Isn’t Yufeng the largest technology company in City Chang? In order to persuade several people to believe in my abilities, I hacked into its system, but I didn’t aim to do any harm,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Because Li Mochen was already aware of that, he wasn’t surprised after hearing that. “I know. Once I heard that you’re good at hacking, I was suspicious of you. We were indeed afraid it might be an enemy who hacked into our system, but it’s not a problem if the hacker is you.”

Leng Xiaoyao knew that Li Mochen had already found out that it was her, so she wasn’t surprised either. She only apologized. “I’m sorry.”

“Alright, apologies accepted,” Li Mochen said. After all, what Leng Xiaoyao had done really worried them, so Li Mochen accepted Leng Xiaoyao’s apology on behalf of the staff.

After telling him the truth, Leng Xiaoyao was very relieved.

When they arrived at the hospital, Leng Xiaoyao got out of the car and thanked Li Mochen before walking away.

Li Mochen didn’t drive away immediately. Instead, looking at Leng Xiaoyao’s back, he had mixed emotions.

Gradually, he was becoming convinced that Leng Xiaoyao had no intention of hurting him.

…

The news about Xi Keyi lost attention, and Leng Yecheng was almost mentally stable. He didn’t spend much time thinking about Xi Keyi these days, and focused on the stocks instead.
