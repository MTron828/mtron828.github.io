Chapter 1659: Tang Bingsen Has a Heart Attack

She didn’t ask him who Feng Lin and Feng Qile was, which meant she already knew them and Tang Bingsen believed that she must have abducted them.

“Is it you?” asked Tang Bingsen.

“Yeah, it’s me.” Gu Ning admitted it.

“You...” Tang Bingsen was mad. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Why did you do that?” asked Tang Bingsen in anger. “They have no grudge against you.”

“You’re right, so I didn’t hurt them, but they stood in my way, so I had to remove them. I simply gave them some money and told them to cut their relationship with you,” said Gu Ning airily.

Hearing that, Jing Yunyao frowned.

“What do you want?” asked Tang Bingsen.

“I told you I want the Tang family’s wealth. As long as you’re willing to let me take it over, I can let you go, or you can wait to be punished,” said Gu Ning in a cold tone.

Jing Yunyao realized that Gu Ning must have a long-standing grudge against this Mr. Tang on the other side of the phone. However, she didn’t know why.

She was worried that Mr. Tang might be Gu Ning’s ex-boyfriend. Although she shouldn’t judge Gu Ning if Gu Ning had ex boyfriends, she didn’t want Leng Shaoting to be hurt if Gu Ning still kept in touch with her ex-boyfriend.

Even though they hated each other, hatred was also an emotion.

“Tang Bingsen, if I had found out the truth earlier, you would have been killed a long time ago. You betrayed your first wife, Ai Xinrong, because you’re too selfish. It must have something to do with you that she fell into a vegetative state in the car accident!” Gu Ning was suspicious of Tang Bingsen.

Ai Xinrong was Tang Aining’s mother, and Tang Aining inherited her mother’s surname.

Tang Bingsen got nervous when Gu Ning said that, because the car accident was indeed a part of his scheme.

Jing Yunyao was also scared when she heard that.

“Once your first wife was caught in the car accident, you welcomed your mistress and illegitimate daughter and threw your biological daughter into a cruel training camp. You made full use of her and forced her to do bad deeds for the Tang family’s interests, but you will be disappointed, because Tang Aining isn’t dead and you will pay for what you’ve done!” said Gu Ning with a sneer.

Jing Yunyao was shocked and believed that Gu Ning was also Tang Aining. It turned out that Gu Ning had been sent to a cruel training camp before when she was only a little girl. No wonder she was so excellent at fighting!

All of a sudden, Jing Yunyao had a deep sympathy for Gu Ning.

“You...” Tang Bingsen was furious, but didn’t know what to say.

Gu Ning didn’t give him any chances and directly hung up on him. Even though she lost control of her emotions just then, she would be fine in a few minutes.

After that, Gu Ning realized that her conversation with Tang Bingsen on the phone might have been heard by Jing Yunyao. Luckily, she didn’t care about it.

Tang Bingsen was still furious when Gu Ning suddenly ended the call, so he fainted again.

Because he was walking back and forth during the call with Gu Ning, he collapsed straight to the ground. Tang Bingsen struggled to get back to his feet and covered his chest with one hand. He found it was hard for him to breathe.

He soon realized that he was in a very bad condition, so he called his housekeeper and ordered the housekeeper to call his family doctor over.

This wasn’t the first time that he had suddenly fainted after having a call with Gu Ning, so he hired a family doctor to take care of him.

The housekeeper was downstairs, but Tang Bingsen was out of strength to call for help at this moment. He could only do his best to make a call.

The second the housekeeper received Tang Bingsen’s call and heard the word doctor, he called the doctor and went upstairs together.

They saw bright light from Tang Bingsen’s study, so they ran to find him there.

“Master Tang!” The housekeeper and the doctor ran to help Tang Bingsen at once.

The doctor found that Tang Bingsen had a heart problem, so they immediately sent him to the hospital.

After the medical check, it turned out that Tang Bingsen had a heart disease and his blood pressure was also very high.

In that case, he had to stay calm and never lose control of his emotions, because it might cause a serious problem to his health.

Tang Bingsen understood it very well, so he did his best to calm down. At the same time, he hated “Tang Aining” to death.

The richer a man was, the more afraid he was of death.

Because of “Tang Aining”, Tang Bingsen had fainted twice and his body was in a bad condition now. Therefore, Tang Bingsen hated her very much, but he hated her even more because he couldn’t do anything to pay her back.

...

Jing Yunyao didn’t fall asleep until it was 3 am, but she got up very early the next morning and went to prepare breakfast for Gu Ning after knowing what she had been through.

When she washed her face, she noticed that the scar had completely disappeared, which amazed her.

She finally realized that Gu Ning’s power crystals were as effective as magical pills.
