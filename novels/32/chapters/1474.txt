Chapter 1475: The Older Daughter of the Tang Family?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

No matter what, Gu Ning was determined to take action today.

After the bridegroom’s confession, the bride slowly walked towards the stage holding her father’s arm. Everyone was stunned again when the bride appeared.

“Wow, she’s so beautiful.”

“The bride is the most beautiful woman at the wedding.”

“Well, I don’t think every bride could be as beautiful as her.”

“...”

When Tang Yaxin walked towards Qi Ziyue with her hand in her father’s elbow, she beamed with happiness.

This was the happiest moment in her life! She really loved Qi Ziyue and couldn’t wait to marry him.

Qi Ziyue, on the contrary, didn’t feel happy at all at this moment. He was simply excited because he finally married Tang Yaxin, which was a big step forward according to his plan.

However, what he didn’t know was that his wedding with Tang Yaxin was soon going to be ruined.

Right when the host was about to say something again as Tang Bingsen and Tang Yaxin reached the stage, Gu Ning walked out from among the guests. She quickly walked to the stage without hesitation.

Everyone was confused and didn’t understand what she was doing.

“What’s she doing?”

“No idea.”

“I think something unpleasant is going to happen.”

“...”

Gu Ning indeed came to ruin Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin’s wedding.

Although she didn’t look like Tang Aining now, Tang Aining’s soul was in her body.

Once those reporters sensed that something unusual was going to happen, they turned their cameras to point at Gu Ning.

Tang Qingyang’s sight fell on Gu Ning with a calm expression, because he knew that this woman must have been arranged by Gu Ning. He sat still on his seat, and waited to see the unfolding drama.

Jiang Ruiqin and Song Nan were aware of it as well, so they got excited.

“Qingyang, are you sure it’s fine?” Jiang Ruiqin asked Tang Qingyang in a low voice.

“Of course,” Tang Qingyang said with certainty.

Tang Qingyang didn’t tell them many details, but they chose to believe him. They were Tang Qingyang’s good friends after all, so they supported him. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As Gu Ning walked to the stage, Qi Ziyue saw her and rounded his eyes in shock.

He recognized “Tang Aining”, but didn’t know what she was going to do at his wedding. Nevertheless, it was quite obvious that she came for nothing good.

Qi Ziyue remembered that she kept some of Tang Aining’s stuff in her hands and began to be worried about it. He had searched for her for a long time in vain, but now she appeared again out of blue.

Seeing Qi Ziyue’s reaction and the other guests’ discussion, Tang Bingsen and Tang Yaxin were annoyed.

Ji Yijing also noticed Gu Ning’s abnormal behavior and frowned worriedly.

Tang Yaxin had the same reaction as Qi Ziyue. She was nervous and terrified. “What are you doing here?”

Hearing that, the other guests were sure that they weren’t strangers.

“To attend your wedding.” There was an evil smile on Gu Ning’s lips.

“I think you simply want to ruin my wedding! Where are the security guards? Get her out now!” Tang Yaxin shouted.

Security guards who stood around them ran over at once.

“Wait a second!” Gu Ning stopped them.

“Who are you? What do you want to do?” Ji Yijing glared at Gu Ning.

Ji Yijing thought that Gu Ning must be Qi Ziyue’s woman, and she felt angry for her daughter. She knew that it was hard for men, especially rich men, to stay loyal to their partner, but it was unacceptable in her eyes when it happened to her own daughter.

Qi Ziyue was struck dumb by the scene, and didn’t know what to do now. He wanted to explain it, but Gu Ning interrupted him.

“Ms. Ji, don’t be nervous. We’re a family, and please allow me to introduce myself now. My name’s Tang Aining, the older daughter of the Tang family. Yaxin is my half sister, and I came back home simply to give her my best wishes at her wedding. Why do you want to catch me?” Gu Ning said and looked innocent.

“What?” Everyone was shocked when they heard it. Not many of them knew that Tang Bingsen had another daughter. At the same time, they felt it was very strange.

Since this woman was the older daughter of the Tang family, why couldn’t members of the Tang family recognize her?

Tang Bingsen and Ji Yijing, however, were in a sheer panic now. They absolutely didn’t believe that this woman standing in front of them was really Tang Aining, because Tang Aining was already dead. In that case, this woman must have disguised herself as Tang Aining.

Anyway, it was a sign of great danger that she showed up out of blue.

Tang Bingsen slightly clenched his fists.
