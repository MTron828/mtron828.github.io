Chapter 2355: The Less Trouble the Better

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Although she wanted to catch Ma Shibiao and Nicholas alive and hand them to Leng Shaoting, she didn’t care about it if they were killed. Anyway, they would be sentenced to death after Leng Shaoting caught them.

Gu Ning backed to the edge of the room, waiting to see the drama.

Nicholas also walked towards her. He wasn’t sure whether Gu Ning was right and whether there was really a ghost, but he thought that he better be more careful.

Seeing their reaction, Ma Shibiao panicked a little. Could there really be ghosts? Was there a ghost in this coffin?

Ma Shibiao hesitated. However, he only hesitated for a few seconds, then went to open a coffin.

“Miss Gu, have you seen ghosts before?” Nicholas asked. Although he asked that question, he actually already had the answer. If Gu Ning hadn’t seen ghosts before, she wouldn’t be so calm now.

“Yes, how about you?” Gu Ning asked.

She asked that casually, because she was sure that Nicholas had met ghosts before. He even carried a soul with him.

Because Nicholas was sure that Gu Ning had seen ghosts before, he wasn’t surprised when Gu Ning admitted it. “What do you think?” he asked instead, returning Gu Ning’s question.

He was trying to find out how much Gu Ning knew about him.

Gu Ning understood his purpose, but she didn’t care. “How could I know whether you’ve seen ghosts before?” She smiled.

Even though Gu Ning said that, Nicholas thought she was lying. If she didn’t know, how could she know that he believed in ghosts?

“Miss Gu, do you know me?” Nicholas asked.

“This is our first meeting. I don’t even know your name. I don’t think we’ve met before,” said Gu Ning honestly.

Nicholas wasn’t convinced. “If so, why do you think that I believe in ghosts?”

“Just my feelings,” said Gu Ning.

Her feelings? He didn’t think so.

Before Nicholas continued to ask Gu Ning questions, Ma Shibiao had already opened a coffin and saw the body lying inside. Instantly, he got a fright and dumped the coffin lid, running away.

Jesus, there was a body in it and it was preserved so well it was as if there was a person sleeping inside. However, it didn’t seem to be a living person.

In that case, it could only be a ghost.

“Oh, what’s wrong? Why are you so scared?” Gu Ning made fun of them. She knew that they were frightened by the body in the coffin.

“A-A ghost…” Ma Shibiao pointed at the coffin in great horror. Although it wasn’t proven yet, he believed that it was a ghost.

What else could it be? Would anyone deliberately sleep inside to scare other people? Nobody would be so bored and annoying!

A ghost?

Nicholas was scared too. He wasn’t surprised by the existence of ghosts, but he was astonished that there was really a ghost. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The next second, Nicholas turned to observe Gu Ning. Did she know that there was a ghost in the coffin? Who was she? How could she know? Or was it just a guess?

“A ghost? Didn’t you refuse to believe in ghosts? Why did you say there is a ghost now?” Gu Ning laughed at him. She wasn’t scared at all when she heard there was a ghost.

Normally, mortals couldn’t see ghosts. So how could Ma Shibiao and his subordinates see it?

Mortals couldn’t see normal ghosts, but this ghost wasn’t normal.

After a ghost reached a certain level, it could become an entity. Or as with this female body, a spell was cast when they died so that they wouldn’t rot and their soul stayed in the body. In fact, Gu Ning knew very little about it, but as a cultivator, she wasn’t surprised by such strange things.

Ma Shibiao was struck dumb. He indeed refused to believe in ghosts earlier, but now…

Ma Shibiao and his subordinates didn’t know what to say. It was still difficult for them to accept that ghosts really existed in this world, but they had to admit that it was true.

At the same time, they were also surprised that Gu Ning was aware of the ghost in the coffin. Who was she? How could she know that there was a ghost? She didn’t seem scared at all!

Nicholas hadn’t seen a local ghost before, so he immediately went up to have a look.

He wasn’t scared of ghosts either.

Gu Ning didn’t go ahead. She stood at the edge, enjoying watching the drama.

At the front of the coffin, Nicholas saw a female body lying in the coffin. It was wearing local, ancient costumes.

Although the female body was kept well, its face was completely pale without any breath. It was dead without doubt. However, Nicholas couldn’t smell rotting either, so it confused him.

Gu Ning knew the reason. It was because of the Taoist talisman on its body.

When Nicholas saw the Taoist talisman, he reached out his hand to pick it up out of curiosity.

“Stop it!” Gu Ning stopped him at once, then walked over.

Nicholas stopped. He wasn’t mad because Gu Ning interrupted him. Instead, he felt that Gu Ning told him to stop for a reason.

Gu Ning walked to the front of the coffin. After a glance at the body in it, she turned to look at Nicholas and said, “If you pull off the Taoist talisman, this ghost will wake up. If it wakes the other one up, we’ll be in great danger.”

Hearing that, Nicholas gave up the idea of removing the Taoist talisman. He wasn’t scared, but there was nothing valuable in this coffin. There was only a sword next to the body.

It was a good sword, but he didn’t have to take it away. Therefore, the less trouble, the better.

“Why don’t we leave these two coffins here and open this stone door instead?” Ma Shibiao said. Although he was frightened by the ghost, they could stay away from the coffins since Gu Ning said that they would be fine as long as they didn’t move the bodies inside.

They were already here, so they had to take something away with them. The treasures should be hidden behind the door!

“No, you can’t move this door either. There might be something scarier than these two coffins behind it,” said Gu Ning.

Even she was reluctant to touch the stone door.. So she didn’t want them to do that, unless they were willing to risk their lives.
