Chapter 2709: Why Can’t I Have a Flood Dragon?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning didn’t want to talk about it publicly, but Jing Yuelan already mentioned it aloud. If she didn’t explain, people might think it was her family’s fault.

In addition, it had already gone viral on the Internet, so it wasn’t a secret.

Hearing Gu Ning’s explanation, everyone was surprised. They also felt that the name Jing Yunyao sounded familiar, but couldn’t remember her right away.

Anyway, it was too cruel for Jing Yuelan’s grandfather to have tried to kill Jing Yunyao and her son many times.

If Jing Yunyao didn’t fight back, she and her son would end up being killed.

“If it hadn’t been for Jing Yunyao, my grandmother wouldn’t have been injured by my grandfather. If Jing Yunyao hadn’t humiliated the Jing family, my grandfather wouldn’t have tried to kill her!” Jing Yuelan angrily shouted, taking it for granted, which angered the crowd.

Her grandmother was injured by her grandfather, but she blamed other people for that. And she even agreed that one should be killed after doing something embarrassing. It was too much!

“I don’t argue with stupid people. Let’s talk about it with the Jing family.” Gu Ning was unwilling to waste more time on Jing Yuelan. Once she finished, she picked Jing Yuelan up and decided to go to the cultivation world.

However, Jing Yuelan suddenly yelled, “Don’t be fooled by Gu Ning. She isn’t a human. She’s a monster, a monster!”

Jing Yuelan didn’t say that Gu Ning was a cultivator, but a monster, because she was trying to defame Gu Ning. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

In her eyes, cultivators were superior to mortals. If she said Gu Ning was a cultivator, she was afraid the public would admire her even more.

Hearing Jing Yuelan’s words, Gu Ning rolled her eyes with a resigned look. Then she hit the back of Jing Yuelan’s neck heavily, knocking her out.

The crowd was astonished by Jing Yuelan’s words, and felt she was too crazy. They didn’t believe in monsters after all.

......

Gu Ning understood that it wasn’t convincing, but she still said, “You’re crazy. If I was really a monster, you wouldn’t dare to mess with me.”

No one believed Jing Yuelan’s words, so they just found it funnier after hearing Gu Ning’s reply.

After that, Gu Ning put Jing Yuelan into her car and left.

At the same time, Gu Ning called Chen Cangyi and told him that she had already caught the woman who damaged her store. He could restore it and she would get the woman to pay for it.

Gu Ning went straight to the cultivation world. She didn’t tell Jing Yunyao about it, because she could handle it alone. Moreover, Jing Jining was also in the cultivation world!

After Gu Ning took Jing Yuelan to the cultivation world, she woke her up.

“Let me go!” Jing Yuelan struggled and said angrily.

“Let you go? No way!” Gu Ning sneered dangerously. “I couldn’t do anything to you outside earlier, but now there is nothing I have to be afraid of.”

Saying that, Gu Ning beat Jing Yuelan and injured her so that she couldn’t stand up or walk, but it wasn’t a problem, because Gu Ning could pick her up.

“You…” Jing Yuelan was angry and in pain, because Gu Ning beat her badly.

Although Gu Ning couldn’t fly with a sword, the white female flood dragon could quickly go down the mountain and over the river to get to City Sky.

Gu Ning directly let the white female flood dragon out in front of Jing Yuelan, which amazed her. She didn’t expect a flood dragon to be with Gu Ning.

Although the flood dragon was a monster now, it could become a dragon once it evolved. And after it became a dragon, it would become a god.

Although cultivators should kill monsters and ghosts once they met any, the flood dragon was different. Flood dragons could become dragons and gods, so they would keep them instead of killing them.

Therefore, Jing Yuelan wasn’t just surprised, she was also jealous of Gu Ning for having a flood dragon.

“How did you get a flood dragon?” Jing Yuelan questioned jealously, as if Gu Ning was forbidden to keep a flood dragon.

“Why can’t I have a flood dragon?” Gu Ning sneered.

Afterwards, she picked up Jing Yuelan and sat on the back of the flood dragon. The flood dragon then carried them to the City Sky.

However, Gu Ning didn’t fly straight to the gate of the City Sky. Instead, she landed five hundred meters away. After putting the flood dragon back into the telepathic eye space, she picked Jing Yuelan up walking to the gate.

Nearly everyone in City Sky knew Jing Yuelan, so they attracted a lot of attention as soon as they appeared. Everyone was curious about what had happened.

Did Jing Yuelan annoy the girl and get injured, or did the girl rescue Jing Yuelan?

Although everyone was curious about it, no one dared to ask.

Before long, someone recognized Gu Ning and realized that Jing Yuelan must have annoyed her and Gu Ning had taught her a lesson, but they didn’t dare to say that in front of Gu Ning, so they only talked about it after Gu Ning walked away.

Within a short while, more and more people found out that Gu Ning was the girl who visited the Jing family with Shangguan Yang and the others last time.

Gu Ning didn’t take Jing Yuelan to the Jing family’s side house, she went straight to the main house. She wanted to let Jing Jining deal with it. After all, Jing Jining was the Jing family’s patriarch, so it was more appropriate for him to deal with it.

Even though Jing Yaorong’s family was chased out, Jing Yunfei, Jing Yunchan, and Jing Yunyan were still on the family tree, so they were still considered members of the Jing family.

Nearly all the members of the Jing family remembered Gu Ning’s face, so the gatekeeper directly invited her in.

Jing Jining had given an order that Shangguan Yang, Jing Yunyao, Leng Shaoting, and Gu Ning could directly come in without permission.

Although Jing Yuelan was forbidden from coming into the Jing family’s main house, no one stopped Gu Ning from taking her inside. Anyway, Jing Yuelan was seriously injured, so Gu Ning must have come to deal with her.

In the front yard…

Gu Ning stopped and dumped Jing Yuelan to the ground.

Before Gu Ning even said anything, someone reported it to Jing Jining.

A while later, Jing Jining came.

He didn’t know what had happened, but heard that Gu Ning came with a seriously injured Jing Yuelan, so he figured out what must have happened.
