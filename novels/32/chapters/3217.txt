3219 You’re Not Important in My Eyes

Old Mrs. Wang was very loud, as if she would be more reasonable when she spoke louder. However, Wang Yiming was sure that she was feeling guilty.

Even if his mother wasn’t exposed, Wang Yiming understood that they simply wanted to get more money from him.

“I didn’t mean that,” Wang Yiming said, but he didn’t explain it. There was nothing he should explain.

“If not, what do you mean?” asked Old Mrs. Wang. She believed that Wang Yiming thought she was trying to cheat him out of money. Even if it was the truth, she wouldn’t allow Wang Yiming to doubt her like that.

“Nothing. Alright, I’ll call uncle right now,” Wang Yiming said. Afterwards, he directly hung up. He didn’t want to talk to Old Mrs. Wang any longer.

Old Mrs. Wang was furious when Wang Yiming hung up on her. She even wanted to smash the phone, but she didn’t dare to do that because she didn’t have money to buy a new one.

“Damn, he’s ungrateful. How dare he hang up on me?” Old Mrs. Wang gritted through her teeth. After that, she called her younger brother at once, but the line was busy. Obviously, Wang Yiming made the call before her.

Zhao Shanchuan and Old Mrs. Wang were biological brother and sister, so he would obviously side with Old Mrs. Wang, even if Old Mrs. Wang never hesitated to exploit Wang Yiming and didn’t tell Wang Yiming that he wasn’t her biological son.

However, he still disliked Old Mrs. Wang’s behavior, so he tried to persuade Old Mrs. Wang not to do too much. If Wang Yiming was hurt deeply, he wouldn’t take care of her any longer.

If Old Mrs. Wang wanted to borrow money from him and let Wang Yiming return it, he wasn’t dumb and required Wang Yiming’s agreement.

If Wang Yiming disagreed, he would have to ask his own older sister to return the money. However, his older sister never kept her word, and he didn’t want to lose money!

Besides, Old Mrs. Wang asked for too much this time, so Zhao Shanchuan didn’t agree.

Right after Zhao Shanchuan finished his call with Wang Yiming, Old Mrs. Wang called him. The moment he answered it, Old Mrs. Wang directly asked, “Did Wang Yiming call you just now?”

“Yes, but you’re not seriously injured. It only costs several thousand yuan for you to stay in the hospital for a few days. How could you ask Wang Yiming for twenty thousand yuan? Xiangyang even raised the number to fifty thousand yuan. Hasn’t Wang Yiming done enough for you? Don’t you know that he just had a car accident and is in the hospital now? Do you want him to know that he isn’t your biological son? Do you want to hurt him so deeply that he will abandon you?” Zhao Shanchuan criticized Old Mrs. Wang. He visited her yesterday, so he clearly knew her condition.

Old Mrs. Wang was struck dumb and didn’t know what to say.

After a long while, she argued. “Won’t he receive compensation?”

“Do you think he can get the compensation so quickly? It requires a lot of formalities. Why don’t you understand such a simple thing? Is your brain empty?” Zhao Shanchuan said without hesitation.

“Enough, I’m your older sister. How can you say that to me?” Old Mrs. Wang snapped at him.

“If you weren’t my older sister, I would have told Wang Yiming that you’re not his biological mother early on. Do you think he’ll still look after you then?” Zhao Shanchuan said angrily. He felt that Old Mrs. Wang was ungrateful for his kindness. “Perhaps he has doubted whether he’s your biological son many times before. If you still want to rely on him to live, have some shame. Don’t exploit him too much. Even your biological son would be hurt deeply by your behavior, let alone someone who isn’t your biological son. Xiangyang isn’t young. If he doesn’t have a good job, I’m afraid no one will want to marry him. If you want him to die alone, you can continue to spoil him. After all, you will have to bear the result in the end.”

Old Mrs. Wang was angry, but couldn’t deny it. She knew that Zhao Shanchuan was right, so she could only hang up unhappily.

Even though she treated Wang Yiming badly, she was unwilling to let him know that he wasn’t her biological son. After all, Wang Xiangyang was a good-for-nothing, so she had to rely on Wang Yiming to live.

As for Wang Xiangyang, she obviously didn’t want him to die alone. She always wanted him to marry. Anyway, Wang Xiangyang was her only biological son. She didn’t want her family to have no offspring! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

However, because Wang Yiming didn’t have a real job, no woman was willing to marry him.

Thinking of that, Old Mrs. Wang was full of worry.

After Wang Xiangyang got back, she talked to him about getting a job and marriage.

Upon her mentioning work, Wang Xiangyang got angry. He didn’t have any skills, but dreamed of making a fortune. However, he did nothing towards that.

Even if there was a high salary, he wouldn’t like it because it was tiring. If the job wasn’t tiring, he still hated it because it had a low salary.

…

In the capital city.

At about 6 pm, Li Mochen took Mu Yuan and Meng Fan to the six-star, Shengjing Restaurant, in the capital city.

As soon as he walked into the hall, he saw a familiar face.

Li Mochen wanted to ignore him, but the man was excited once he saw him. He immediately walked over and blocked Li Mochen’s way.

Afterwards, he mocked. “Oh, isn’t this my older cousin who left home and claimed to cut off the relationship with the Li family? It’s been ages. I thought you weren’t in the capital city.”

He was making fun of Li Mochen. After all, he was excited because he had a chance to laugh at Li Mochen. Ever since they were little, he was used to bullying Li Mochen, so it became his way to release anger.

Although Li Mochen left the Li family, he still met the Li family once in a while because he often stayed in the capital city. Therefore, Li Xiaoyang recognized him at a glance.

“Since I’ve cut off my relationship with the Li family, you shouldn’t call me cousin again,” Li Mochen said coldly. He didn’t even bother to give Li Xiaoyang a glance.

Li Xiaoyang was displeased and embarrassed. “I called you cousin simply for the sake of your face. Don’t flatter yourself.”

In Li Xiaoyang’s eyes, Li Mochen was abandoned by the Li family. Without the Li family, he was merely a nobody.

Obviously, he had no idea how successful Li Mochen was right now. He had only heard that Li Mochen had a relationship with several important people.

However, that was barely comparable to the Li family.

After all, the Li family was one of the seven most powerful families in the capital city.

“You’re not important in my eyes,” Li Mochen said coldly. He wouldn’t bother to be nice to Li Xiaoyang.
