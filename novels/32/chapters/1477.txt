Chapter 1478: It’s Disgusting

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Actually, Gu Ning also had videos in her hands.

“Oh, my eyes!”

“I thought that the bride and the bridegroom were in love.”

“I can’t believe it.”

“Both of them live a decadent life.”

“It’s disgusting.”

“...”

Most men didn’t have strong emotions, because they were happy to talk about sex. Most women, on the other hand, felt disgusted. Even though they had sex too, it was embarrassing when the nude pictures went public.

Tang Qingyang and Jiang Ruiqin also picked up several photos, and they were disgusted too.

“Ew, it’s gross!” Saying that, Jiang Ruiqin threw the photos away.

Tang Qingyang didn’t know what Gu Ning had on Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin until now. Thinking about how Gu Ning had seen these photos before she came to today’s wedding, Tang Qingyang felt uncomfortable. Gu Ning was already an adult and she also had a boyfriend, but it was still quite embarrassing.

Actually, when Gu Ning got these photos, she felt shocked and awkward as well. If it was possible, she didn’t want to see these photos either, but she had to print and see the evidence herself.

What was worse, two of the men in the nude photos with Tang Yaxin were present at today’s wedding. They were astonished and scared the moment they saw their faces in the photos. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

These photos were taken from the sex tapes they secretly recorded without Tang Yaxin knowing.

They were astonished because they didn’t know how the pictures were leaked. The two of them were eager to leave now, but they were afraid that they might be discovered if they did that, so they could only lower their heads to make themselves as unnoticeable as possible.

“Don’t look at these photos!” Tang Bingjiang grabbed the photos away from his children’s hands.

Some kids at the wedding also had some nude photos in their hands, but their parents stopped them from looking at the photos. Tang Bingjiang’s family was also a part of the Tang family, and felt humiliated too.

Those photos weren’t thrown towards Tang Bingsen and his family, so they didn’t see them, but they knew that it must be a terrible thing given the guests’ reaction.

The reporters were busy taking those photos away, and depending on what happened later, they would either report this shocking news or not.

In fact, even if they didn’t report this news, it would still go viral on the Internet, because Gu Ning wasn’t afraid of the Tang family at all.

Anyway, Tang Yaxin and Qi Ziyue’s reputations were totally ruined.

“Mr. Qi, since you’re going to marry Miss Tang, why do you still keep a sexual relationship with other women?”

“Mr. Qi, does it mean that you don’t love Miss Tang? Why are you marrying her? Do you want to steal the Tang family’s property through your marriage?”

The reporters bombarded him with questions, and Qi Ziyue changed his expression at once. His nude photos with other women were exposed now, so it was impossible for him to marry Tang Yaxin after that. At the same time, he still couldn’t figure out how Gu Ning managed to get those photos.

Both Tang Yaxin and Qi Ziyue felt quite humiliated.

Tang Bingsen couldn’t stay calm any longer. He grabbed some photos from other guests and was full of anger when he saw them. As a rich man, he was aware that almost every rich man had mistresses. However, he thought that Qi Ziyue should keep it a secret from other people.

Tang Yaxin and Ji Yijing also saw those photos. Tang Yaxin didn’t believe that Qi Ziyue would betray her, although she was playing around as well. It was unacceptable in her eyes.

Tang Yaxin married Qi Ziyue because she really loved him, but it was an undeniable truth that she was in a much higher social position than him. She was better than him, and she could do whatever she wanted, but Qi Ziyue couldn’t. After all, without her help, Qi Ziyue wouldn’t have what he had right now.

Ji Yijing was furious and slapped Qi Ziyue. Qi Ziyue was still in shock, so he failed to avoid it. Actually, he didn’t dare to avoid it either.

With a loud sound, a heavy slap fell on Qi Ziyue’s face.

Ji Yijing shouted at him in great anger, “Qi Ziyue, how dare you do that to my daughter?”

Ji Yijing only saw nude photos of Qi Ziyue having sex with other women, she didn’t see the pictures of her daughter having threesome with other men.

Compared with what Tang Yaxin had done, Qi Ziyue’s behavior wasn’t worse.
