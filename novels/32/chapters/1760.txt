Chapter 1761: Get out Now

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Chu Peihan laughed and said, “No, because you didn’t bet that our boss will win. You bet on Du Hao because you hoped that he would win. Do you know what our boss will be forced to do if Du Hao wins? It doesn’t mean you’ll be fine even if you don’t know something.”

“What will she be forced to do?” Hearing that, many people asked with curiosity. They thought it was just a game about money, but it seemed that they were wrong and the loser could face a serious punishment.

“You will know later, and I believe they’ll be out soon,” said Chu Peihan.

Since Chu Peihan refused to tell them, they stopped asking and the cars were coming out. They turned to focus on the game.

About a minute later, Gu Ning’s car came out and it stopped steadily at the exit.

She spent seven minutes and twenty seconds on the road, which broke the record at the twisting mountain road at Fushan. The previous record was seven minutes and forty-seven seconds, and it was done by a professional racing driver without any obstacles on the road. If it was a race, it might take a longer time.

Normally, it took about nine minutes to finish this track, and wouldn’t be longer than ten minutes. Therefore, the host set the fee at ten thousand yuan for ten minutes, in case anyone deliberately wasted time on the road.

Once Gu Ning showed up, a group of people surrounded her, including Mu Ke, Yu Mixi, and Zhang Zikai. Chu Peihan, instead, stayed at the betting table.

Mingzhe was in despair at this time. He knew he lost the game. If he had known it earlier on, he wouldn’t have chosen to have a car race against Gu Ning, and would have made another choice.

He still didn’t regret challenging Gu Ning, but regretted using the wrong way.

Gu Ning got out of the car and seemed to be at ease.

“Goddess Gu, you’re so unbelievable! You just set a new record.”

“Yes! It’s so amazing. You’re my idol now.”

“...”

Everyone kept complimenting Gu Ning, and Du Hao’s car came out at this time. He spent eight minutes and nine seconds on the road, which was nearly a minute longer than the time Gu Ning had spent.

Because he lost, everyone looked at him with disdain when he walked out. Some also made fun of him.

“Isn’t he a professional racing driver from an official team? He lost the race to an ordinary girl. It’s so humiliating.”

“Right, if the news went abroad, how would he keep his position in the car racing industry.”

“...”

Hearing their discussion, Du Hao felt embarrassed and couldn’t wait to disappear. He really regretted helping Mingzhe have this race today, and felt quite humiliated after losing it to an ordinary girl. If his peers learned about it, he would become a joke.

If he had known the result, he wouldn’t have agreed to help no matter how much Mingzhe paid him. Unfortunately, it was too late to regret it now, and he had also believed that he could win at the beginning.

After that, Du Hao didn’t stay there any longer, but directly drove to Mingzhe’s car. He said something to Mingzhe, then left right away.

Du Hao said, “Deal with the rest on your own.”

Although he lost the game on behalf of Mingzhe, he didn’t feel guilty at all, because his reputation was damaged too. His reputation was more valuable than what Mingzhe wanted to do.

“Mingzhe.” Du Hao’s cousin wanted to say something, but didn’t know what to say right now. Neither of them could expect that Du Hao would lose.

“Actually, that is the general level of professional racing drivers, Gu Ning is too unbelievable.” Seeing Du Hao’s car driving away, someone made a fair judgment.

Hearing that, other people stopped making fun of Du Hao, but they still continued to compliment Gu Ning.

Gu Ning thanked them, then walked towards Mingzhe.

Seeing Gu Ning walking over, Mingzhe didn’t know what he should do, because he was going to kneel and kowtow to Gu Ning three times. He also had to say that he was sorry three times right in front of everyone.

He planned to humiliate Gu Ning, but unexpectedly he was the one who would suffer the humiliation. Mingzhe ached to escape, but he knew it was impossible, so he hid himself in the car.

When everyone saw Gu Ning walking to Mingzhe, they knew something was going to happen and they followed at once.

“Hey, take the money you won away,” Chu Peihan said to Cao Yang.

“No need, it’s all yours. Don’t forget your promise. Invite us to have night snacks together,” said Cao Yang. He didn’t care much about the money, and simply wanted to bribe Chu Peihan.

All four of them bet five thousand yuan on the game. At the odds of 2-1, each of them could have ten thousand yuan back.

Normally, if seven people shared good night snacks together, it would only cost about two thousand yuan, but they were willing to pay twenty thousand yuan. They really didn’t care about money.

“Fine, I know you’re rich.” Chu Peihan rolled her eyes. Since they didn’t want it, Chu Peihan took all the money. She wouldn’t take all the money as her own, but shared it with Mu Ke and Yu Mixi.

Chu Peihan already gave the money Zhang Zikai won back to her, and she shared the rest with Mu Ke and Yu Mixi.

They were all rich heirs, so each of them bet several thousand yuan on the game. There were about 30 people who joined the bet, so they had over two hundred thousand yuan in all.

The money for the night snacks would be deducted from it, and they would share the rest afterwards.

A group of people followed Gu Ning towards Mingzhe’s car.

“Are you injured and can’t get out of the car right now? Do you need my help?” Gu Ning stared at Mingzhe who sat on the front passenger’s seat with a fake smile.

Mingzhe only had superficial injuries, and they weren’t serious. Since he was able to show up here, it meant that he was fine. At least he could walk. Even though the injuries were painful, he wouldn’t die.

Mingzhe hesitated, but didn’t move at all, because he lacked courage. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Hearing what Gu Ning said, others realized that Mingzhe, instead of Du Hao, had a grudge against her. However, they didn’t know why. They were curious, but no one asked, because they would soon know it.

“Mingzhe, be a man, and get out right now. Since you’ve reached the agreement with Gu Ning, don’t waste our time here,” said Zhang Zikai. She had no sympathy for him, because he asked for it himself.

“If you don’t come out, I’ll directly pull you out,” said Mu Ke in a cold tone.

Mingzhe was reluctant to accept the result, but he was afraid of them, so he had to leave the car.
