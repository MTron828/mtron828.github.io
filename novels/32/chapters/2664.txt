Chapter 2667: I Want to Divorce Him

None of the Rong family stopped Zhang Jiancheng from punching Rong Jingtang. Although Mater Rong was a little unhappy, he understood why Zhang Jiancheng did it, so he didn’t blame him.

If the Zhang family could be less angry after giving Rong Jingtang a punch, it was worth the price.

“Yeah, I’m crazy. And I got crazy because of you.” Zhang Jiancheng rounded his eyes in anger. “Rong Jingtang, are you a real man? How could you do such an amoral thing? Do you think my younger sister is easy to bully? Do you think we’re weak enough to take advantage of? If you don’t like my younger sister, you can get a divorce. We won’t bother you, but don’t humiliate us like that. You’re shameless and have embarrassed two families at the same time!”

“Don’t tell us you just made a mistake that most men would make. Only irresponsible men would do shameless things like that.”

The Rong family were extremely embarrassed and felt guilty. They didn’t know what to say. Even Rong Jingtang had to agree that Zhang Jiancheng’s words were right.

At that moment, Zhang Xinyun heard their argument and came downstairs.

Looking at her haggard face and swollen eyes after crying, her family were heart-broken. Mrs. Zhang immediately went ahead to hug Zhang Xinyun and comforted her. “My baby daughter, don’t be afraid, we’re all here with you. We’ll surely stand up for you.”

“Mom…” Zhang Xinyun finally cried. She did her best to fight back her tears earlier. Even when she was alone in the room, she only dared to whimper, because no one really understood her in this house.

They were a family, so they put their family benefits before her. They wouldn’t really care about her feelings, and they simply wanted her to tolerate and accept it. They would only stop her from getting a divorce.

If it was possible, she wouldn’t want to get a divorce and make the kids lose their father, but she honestly couldn’t accept Rong Jingtang’s betrayal.

If he only cheated on her, she might not divorce him, but Rong Jingtang didn’t just cheat on her. He had an illegitimate son! It was totally unacceptable!

Seeing Zhang Xinyun crying her heart out, the Zhang family was even angrier.

Zhang Jiancheng said in anger, “Rong Jingtang, have you ever thought about your daughters’ feelings? What if they know their father has an illegitimate son outside? How will they think of you? They’ll be ashamed of you. They’ll hate you. Or do you only care about your illegitimate son? Right, if you ever cared about your daughters’ feelings, you wouldn’t have an illegitimate son. If so, you can have a divorce, and Xinyun will come back to the Zhang family with the two kids. I don’t want them to be tortured by a stepmother. We care about our kids whether they are boys or girls.”

......

“Jiancheng, I know it’s Jingtang’s fault, and we feel very guilty about that, but if they get a divorce, the kids will lose their father. It’s not good for them.” Master Rong stopped Zhang Jiancheng at once. It seemed that the Zhang family supported them in getting a divorce.

If they really got a divorce, the Rong family wouldn’t only be embarrassed, they would also lose the Zhang family’s support.

“If they don’t get a divorce, do you want Xinyun to accept the woman and the boy? Xinyun can’t do that, and we won’t accept it either. It’s humiliating. Compared with our reputation, we care more about Xinyun’s happiness. If she’s willing to stay, she can tolerate it. But given the current situation, we don’t think they can stay together any longer. It’ll be a thorn in Xinyun’s side and she’ll spend the rest of her life in pain. Can you watch her live a painful life like that? Once the damage is done, the wound can’t heal,” said Zhang Jiancheng. He was much calmer when speaking to Master Rong.

Hearing that, Master Rong didn’t know what to say, because it was the truth. Even if they didn’t have a divorce, they couldn’t live together happily any longer.

“Well, we will respect Xinyun’s decision,” said Zhang Jiancheng in the end. They wouldn’t make the decision for Zhang Xinyun.

“Xinyun, what do you think?” asked Zhang Jiancheng.

Hearing that, everyone turned to stare at Zhang Xinyun.

“I want a divorce. It’s better for everyone. I can’t tolerate it even if we don’t have a divorce. It’ll only be torture. Actually, if Rong Jingtang just cheated on me, I might still accept it for the sake of the kids, but I can’t accept the illegitimate son. Even though you said you won’t bring him home, who knows what you’ll do in the future. He’s Rong Jingtang’s son after all. When he grows up and becomes independent, he’ll still come back,” said Zhang Xinyun. She saw through them. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“What if I can promise you that we’ll never accept the boy?” Master Rong asked. Given Zhang Xinyun’s attitude, he had to give up the idea of accepting the boy.

After all, the Rong family didn’t lack grandsons. There was no need for them to lose the Zhang family’s support just for an illegitimate son.

He wasn’t normally ruthless, but sometimes he had to make a choice. After all, he wasn’t an ordinary man. Given his status, he had to be rational.

Besides, he had only learned about the illegitimate son today. There was no affection between them.

He would just give them enough money to live a good life, which was already very nice of him.

Afterwards, Master Rong gave Rong Jingtang a warning glance. Rong Jingtang understood it and immediately apologized to Zhang Xinyun. This time, he looked very sincere. “Xinyun, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have done something like that to you. I promise you I won’t take the boy home. I’ll give them money and tell them to move abroad. Even if they come back in the future, I won’t accept them. I won’t see them again either. Can you give me a chance? I’ll make it up to you.”

Even though Rong Jingtang had a very good attitude, Zhang Xinyun couldn’t believe him, because they didn’t want her to get a divorce simply because they were unwilling to lose the Zhang family’s support.

After all, when Rong Jingtang chased her, he had actually targeted her family.
