Chapter 1548: Tang Xiaoxiao Is Becoming Increasingly Better

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning had read the list of famous actors in the entertainment industry, so she remembered all their names. And there was only one actress named An Beibei in the entertainment industry.

Without hesitation, Gu Ning took out her phone and typed down the keyword ‘Tang Xiaoxiao’s boyfriend’, soon finding a lot of news about them. However, an actress appeared in almost every piece of news about Tang Xiaoxiao and her boyfriend.

That actress was precisely An Beibei.

Tang Xiaoxiao’s boyfriend, her ex-boyfriend to be specific, was Huang Yizhen. Huang Yizhen was a singer and a businessman, and he was the only boyfriend Tang Xiaoxiao had admitted in public, but they broke up with each other two years ago.

About a year ago, Huang Yizhen married An Beibei, an A-list actress.

Many people said that An Beibei was the other woman in Tang Xiaoxiao’s romantic relationship with Huang Yizhen, but Huang Yizhen and An Beibei insisted on saying that Huang Yizhen broke up with Tang Xiaoxiao because they had conflicts.

Huang Yizhen and An Beibei played the leading male role and female role in a TV show later, and they fell in love in the show. They dated for half a year before they decided to get married.

There was too much fake news in the entertainment industry, and no one knew what really had happened. However, given what An Beibei just said, Gu Ning knew that An Beibei must have interfered in Tang Xiaoxiao’s relationship with Huang Yizhen.

An Beibei entered the entertainment industry earlier than Tang Xiaoxiao, and she indeed became famous faster than Tang Xiaoxiao as well.

Although An Beibei wasn’t as good at acting as Tang Xiaoxiao, her team was excellent at attracting publicity, and she always appeared in the gossip. In addition, An Beibei was sexier than Tang Xiaoxiao, and always showed a lot of skin in front of the cameras, which was her another way to attract publicity.

After she got married, An Beibei became conservative and kept a distance from other males.

“Tang Xiaoxiao is becoming increasingly better,” Gu Ning said. She couldn’t stand it any longer when someone was bad-mouthing her staff in front of her.

Although it was normal for people to gossip about famous actresses, An Beibei had stolen Tang Xiaoxiao’s boyfriend and she had hurt Tang Xiaoxiao, so Gu Ning had to stand out and defend Tang Xiaoxiao.

An Beibei turned to glare at Gu Ning. “Are you eavesdropping on our conversation?”

“I don’t need to do that, because you’re very loud,” Gu Ning said with disdain.

It was the truth, because many other passengers sitting around them also heard An Beibei’s voice.

“You...” An Beibei was annoyed, but didn’t know what to say.

“Fine, since you’re not eavesdropping on our conversation, tell me why do you think Tang Xiaoxiao is becoming increasingly better? She’s serving for Fenghua Entertainment, which is a newly-established company in the industry. Even though it has gained some fame recently, it isn’t comparable to other leading entertainment companies,” An Beibei said.

“You’re right. Fenghua Entertainment is indeed a newly-established entertainment company, and the competition is quite fierce in the industry, but Tang Xiaoxiao is as beautiful as she is skillful, so I believe she’ll become more and more popular,” Gu Ning said.

“Naive.” An Beibei snorted. “There are countless new faces coming out every day in the entertainment industry, and Tang Xiaoxiao will soon be replaced.”

In fact, An Beibei didn’t say it aloud that Tang Xiaoxiao would be easily destroyed if someone of power did something behind the scenes.

Although An Beibei didn’t get along with Tang Xiaoxiao, their grudge wasn’t enough for her to ruin Tang Xiaoxiao. She had simply stolen Huang Yizhen from Tang Xiaoxiao, and it wasn’t a very serious matter. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I agree with you on that, but I think you’re more likely to be replaced than Tang Xiaoxiao, because you have nothing to rely on in the entertainment industry,” Gu Ning said.

An Beibei was pretty, but wasn’t much prettier than other actresses. Besides, she didn’t have many works, nor a good character.

“You...” An Beibei was angry, but suddenly realized that Gu Ning couldn’t be a simple girl since she knew a lot about the entertainment industry.

“Do you know who I am?” An Beibei got nervous.

“I didn’t know who you were until you said that you stole Tang Xiaoxiao’s boyfriend from her,” Gu Ning said. She stayed calm and stared straight at An Beibei’s eyes.

Hearing that, An Beibei was sure that Gu Ning already found out who she was.

“Ridiculous! Don’t try to damage my reputation by making up fake news! Zhen broke up with Tang Xiaoxiao before we were together!” An Beibei argued.
