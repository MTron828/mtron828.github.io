925 The Business Value of Tang Xiaoxiao

Fan Sixuam aimed to ruin Tang Xiaoxiao. Lord Cen was Fan Sixuan’s sugar daddy, so he helped her trap Tang Xiaoxiao. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Tang Xiaoxiao also had many connections, but Lord Cen wasn’t someone that they dared to mess with.

The Cen family was a super-rich family in City B after all, and not many people were willing to act against them.

Tang Xiaoxiao felt helpless before she met Gu Ning, but now she had hope that Gu Ning might help her out.

Gu Ning had a lot more powerful connections than she did. If Gu Ning was willing to help her, it would be very easy.

Tang Xiaoxiao’s agent didn’t understand why Tang Xiaoxiao turned to a young girl for help in the beginning, but Tang Xiaoxiao said that Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl at all, so she believed that Gu Ning must have been born in an influential family.

However, after observing Gu Ning for a while, she began to feel that Gu Ning was very familiar, then recognized Gu Ning. Gu Ning was the popular Goddess Gu on the Internet!

Tang Xiaoxiao’s agent got excited to see Gu Ning in real life.

“Miss Gu, please give us a helping hand this time. As long as you can help Xiaoxiao out, given her position in the entertainment industry now, she won’t disappoint you if you sign her.” Tang Xiaoxiao’s agent begged Gu Ning.

Tang Xiaoxiao was an A-list actress after all, so it was a profitable deal in Gu Ning’s eyes, so she agreed to help her.

“Do you have a voice recording of your call with Fan Sixuan?” Gu Ning asked.

“No, I was too mad back then and forgot to do that,” Tang Xiaoxiao said.

“What’s the full name of Lord Cen?” Gu Ning asked again.

“Cen Yanheng,” Tang Xiaoxiao replied.

“Great,” Gu Ning said, then called K.

“What’s up, boss?” K asked and sounded delighted.

Gu Ning knew that it must be because of the Mu family.

The Mu family’s business was in a mess now and Mu Xuxin was busy all day dealing with all kinds of problems. His wife even blamed him for failing to bail Mu Wenqi out, and they argued frequently.

K was very pleased to see the Mu family having trouble.

“Help me investigate Cen Yanheng, Lord Cen of the Cen family in City B, and Fan Sixuan, a B-list actress. I need all the evidence of their affair,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, both Tang Xiaoxiao and her agent were cheered up.

“No problem,” K said. “Oh, boss, I need to report two things to you. First, the mobile game that I’ve been working on is already done, and we’re ready to release it once it passes the alpha test. Could you please register a game company when you come to the capital the next time? Second, I noticed a professional killer named Brave Eagle on the wanted list a while ago. I contacted him and talked to him about you. He didn’t believe it at the beginning, but soon agreed to meet us after I removed his name from the list. We’re going to meet tonight.”

“Great, go meet him together with Ba Tianyang to make sure that you’ll be safe,” Gu Ning said.

Although K wasn’t weak, he was hardly comparable to a professional killer.

Ba Tianyang was already a member of their team, and they trusted him.

“I will,” K said. He had the same idea actually.

Even though Brave Eagle agreed to meet him K was still wary, therefore he had threatened Brave Eagle and said that if he didn’t show up, he would put his name back on the list. However, it was also possible that Brave Eagle would kill him when they met given that he had already removed his name from the list.

Brave Eagle was a professional killer after all, so it was super easy for him to kill a man.

After hanging up the call with K, Gu Ning said to Tang Xiaoxiao, “Don’t worry, I’ll handle it. You can stay in this hotel and have a rest. Don’t respond to the scandal. Leave it to me.”

“Thanks!” Tang Xiaoxiao and her agent said. Ever since they found out Gu Ning’s identity, Gu Ning had their complete trust.

“Miss Gu, thank you so much for your help!” Tang Xiaoxiao felt really grateful and had tears in her eyes. She was relieved now.

“That’s only because you’re valuable in my eyes,” Gu Ning said. “If you’re going to work for my company, I hope that you can do you job as well as usual.”

“I will,” Tang Xiaoxiao said at once.

“By the way, you better end the contract with the company you’re working for as soon as possible. You don’t need to pay liquidated damages if they already have the idea to fire you,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure, I’ll give them a call later,” Tang Xiaoxiao’s agent said.

Afterwards, Gu Ning took out her name card and gave it to Tang Xiaoxiao’s agent. “This is my name card. Feel free to call me if anything happens.”

“Thanks.” Tang Xiaoxiao’s agent then exchanged her name card with Gu Ning.

Tang Xiaoxiao’s agent was called Lin Lu.

Before Gu Ning left, she took out a roll of bandages. “Wrap her injuries up, and stay away from water.”

Tang Xiaoxiao was seriously burned, so it would take some time for her to recover.

“Sure,” Lin Lu said.

“Do I need to go to the hospital?” Tang Xiaoxiao asked. She didn’t feel much pain now, but the burns were still on her body.
