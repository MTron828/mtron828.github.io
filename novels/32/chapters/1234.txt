Chapter 1236 An Guangming Meets Gu Ning Again

“Fine, do whatever you want,” the young teacher said.After that, they went to check Tao Jiayi’s injuries.

Although Tao Jiayi’s teacher was a little snobbish, she still was a responsible teacher and she didn’t leave Tao Jiayi alone.

On their way to register, Gu Ning ran into An Guangming.

“Hi, Miss Gu, been a while!” An Guangming’s eyes lit up at once.

“Miss Gu, what happened?” An Guangming’s sight fell on injured Tao Jiayi.

“Director An, nice to see you.” Gu Ning greeted An Guangming. “Well, this girl is my head-teacher’s daughter, and she was injured by her schoolmates. We need to do an injury check right now.”

An Guangming nodded. When Gu Ning mentioned the injury check, he understood what she was going to do.

However, Tao Jiayi’s teacher was astonished when Gu Ning called An Guangming Director An. She couldn’t believe that Gu Ning was able to know the director of this hospital, and they seemed familiar with each other. It seemed that Gu Ning was from a powerful family too.

Thinking of that, the teacher believed that it was highly possible, or Gu Ning wouldn’t insist on punishing those bullies.

“Miss Gu, please follow me this way,” An Guangming said, which meant there was no need for them to register.

Hearing that, Tao Jiayi’s teacher was surprised again.

“Thank you so much, Director An,” Gu Ning said.

Afterwards, they followed An Guangming to the VIP section to check Tao Jiayi.

A few minutes later, the report was out. Tao Jiayi had a slight concussion and her wounds needed to be dealt with as soon as possible.

“Will it affect her life and study?” Zhang Qiuhua was nervous.

“Normally it’s fine, but she needs to stay at home for at least a week. If she feels uncomfortable, she must come here for a further check,” the doctor said.

Actually, Gu Ning could help Tao Jiayi to have a full recovery, but she couldn’t tell Zhang Qiuhua right now.

After that, the doctor went to deal with Tao Jiayi’s wounds.

During this time, Gu Ning asked An Guangming, “Director An, is An Qian on duty today?”

“Yes,” An Guangming said.

“Great, we haven’t seen each other for a long time, and she’s about to get off work now. I thought we could share a meal together,” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning hadn’t thought of An Qian before she came here, but she wanted to invite her to have dinner together.

If An Qian knew that she came here but didn’t tell her, she would be mad.

“Oh, she’s in a bad mood these days, but she’s unwilling to tell me the reason. If it’s possible, please help me comfort her,” An Guangming said. He looked worried. An Qian didn’t have many friends, and he knew that Gu Ning was a very kind girl.

Gu Ning agreed, and she thought that maybe An Qian wasn’t happy because of a romantic relationship.

An Qian lived a good life at her age, and Gu Ning couldn’t think of another reason why she would be unhappy all of a sudden.

“Sure, I’ll ask her later,” Gu Ning said.

After Tao Jiayi’s wounds were treated, Gu Ning told the doctor to write a bill, then she gave it to Zhang Qiuhua.

“Professor Zhang, you can go to pay the bill right now, and we can go to ask for medical expenses and compensation for mental damage later,” Gu Ning said to Zhang Qiuhua.

An Guangming understood that the bill was useful for Gu Ning, so he didn’t pay it for her.

“Sure,” Zhang Qiuhua said and left.

Gu Ning didn’t go with her and stayed in the room.

After knowing that Gu Ning was familiar with An Guangming, Tao Jiayi’s teacher was very sure that Gu Ning was from a powerful family now. She also changed her attitude towards Gu Ning.

Although the girl who bullied Tao Jiayi was from a powerful family as well, the girl’s parents were not as influential as An Guangming. Therefore, Tao Jiayi’s teacher thought that the girl was certainly going to be punished.

When Zhang Qiuhua left to pay the bill, Gu Ning called An Qian and told her that she was in the Central Hospital now. Gu Ning also invited her to dine with her and her schoolmates.

An Qian had been in a bad mood recently, but she was delighted to see Gu Ning.

Afterwards, Gu Ning sent a message to their WeChat group and said that they would meet them later.

Since Gu Ning decided to help Zhang Qiuhua, she thought that she should drive them home too. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Professor Zhang, if you’re willing to trust me, I need to tell you my idea,” Gu Ning said to Zhang Qiuhua when Zhang Qiuhua came back.

“Sure,” Zhang Qiuhua said.

“I hope that the girl’s parents, especially her father, can go to the school at 9 am tomorrow,” Gu Ning said.

Tao Jiayi’s teacher understood that Gu Ning took it very seriously.

Gu Ning continued, “Professor Zhang, you need to ask for leave for a day, and we’ll meet them at the Academic affairs office with the injury report.”

“Sure, I can call the girl’s teacher now, and the girl’s teacher will contact her parents,” Tao Jiayi’s teacher said.

“Great,” Gu Ning said, and Tao Jiayi’s teacher went to make the call.

When Tao Jiayi’s teacher was absent, Gu Ning had some questions to ask Tao Jiayi.
