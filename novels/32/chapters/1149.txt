1150 Let Me Do I

“When did you notice that the man was stalking you?” Gu Ning asked.

Gao Yi said, “We didn’t find out until we were in the plane, but I think he must have begun to stalk us from City B.”

Actually, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya felt a little embarrassed because they didn’t notice it until they were in the plane. The man must have followed them for a long time.

The man sat several rows behind them in the plane and kept glancing at them during the flight.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya felt it was very strange and decided to tell Gu Ning first once they got off the plane.

Gu Ning understood that Gao Yi and Qiao Ya were feeling a little awkward, but she didn’t think it was a big deal. Although they used to be professional killers, they had left the killer organization for a long time after all. They didn’t need to live their life in fear any longer. Moreover, if they failed to notice the man back in City B, it meant that the man was very excellent at following.

“Well, let’s go to a place where nobody is around to see what he wants,” Gu Ning said.

Gao Yi nodded and drove ahead.

Gu Ning, at the same time, used her Jade Eyes again to check whether there were guns in the man’s car.

Even though the man didn’t have guns on him, there might be guns in his car. Besides, it was highly likely that the man came here to kill Gao Yi and Qiao Ya, and he could have guns with him.

However, Gu Ning found no gun, nor a knife. It seemed that the man had absolute confidence in himself without any weapons.

Gao Yi drove a long distance from the airport and finally found a remote place.

It was an industrial district with many factories there.

Because the sign by the road indicated that the industrial district was eight kilometers away, the man who followed Gao Yi and Qiao Ya didn’t think too much about it. He thought that the industrial district was Gao Yi and Qiao Ya’s destination.

When Gu Ning’s car stopped halfway, the man suddenly realized that it was a trap. However, he didn’t retreat and still drove closer. He didn’t have a gun with him, so he had to attack them face to face.

Once his car approached Gu Ning’s car, Gu Ning, Qiao Ya, and Gao Yi got out.

The man stepped out of his car afterwards.

“Who are you? Why are you following us?” Gu Ning asked. She had told Gao Yi and Qiao Ya to remain silent and let her do the talking.

“I need to talk to them,” the man coldly said.

“They’re my bodyguards, so you should gain my agreement first if you want to talk to them,” Gu Ning said. “What do you want?”

In the man’s eyes, Gu Ning was simply a spoiled rich girl, so he didn’t take her seriously.

“I don’t have time to waste on you,” the man said and moved to attack them without delay. There were few cars that passed by there, but they had to finish the fight as soon as possible.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya went forward at once to fight against the man, and Gu Ning wasn’t involved in it. She didn’t believe that the man was able to defeat both Gao Yi and Qiao Ya at the same time.

Nevertheless, she was soon surprised by the man’s ability and unbelievable strength. Although Gao Yi and Qiao Ya didn’t lose, they failed to control the man too.

They were ace killers, but couldn’t beat one man together. It was obvious that this man must be a top killer. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Gu Ning got interested.

“Move away. Let me do it,” Gu Ning said to them.

Hearing that, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya stepped backwards and let Gu Ning in.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya felt utterly embarrassed when they had to turn to Gu Ning for help, but they knew that Gu Ning didn’t mind. Instead, Gu Ning was very excited to have a try.

The man was also surprised by Gu Ning’s skills and strength, because he thought that she was just a weak young girl.

Gu Ning didn’t use her magical power to help her, so they were at the same level of fighting at the beginning.

Even though Gu Ning wasn’t able to defeat him for now, the man was still astonished. This young girl wasn’t weak at all!

“You better not stop me, or you’ll be in big trouble.” The man threatened Gu Ning.

If the person who paid him to kill Gao Yi and Qiao Ya knew that she interfered, she really would be in trouble.

Gu Ning pulled her lips. She wasn’t afraid at all, or she wouldn’t have helped Gao Yi and Qiao Ya out. Since she was already involved, she made up her mind to fight back till the end.

No matter how powerful a killer organization was, it still was reluctant to mess with someone who was more powerful than it.

As long as Gu Ning was powerful enough, she could protect Gao Yi and Qiao Ya from being chased by the killer organization.

A killer organization was founded to make money, so it would stop once it couldn’t get any benefits.

After a short while, they were still in a tie, and Gu Ning enjoyed fighting against a top killer.

During this time, several cars drove past and the drivers were all scared by the fierce fight, but they could see that Gu Ning and the man were both professional. They also noticed Gao Yi and Qiao Ya standing aside watching the fight, so they thought that it was just a competition for fun.
