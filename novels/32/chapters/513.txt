Chapter 514 Quan Mingkai’s Arrival

It was impossible for them to figure out its formula, so Gu Ning was confident to set a high price for her special medicine, she also had no worries that others might abuse her medicine.

Although An Qian believed Gu Ning, her father probably didn’t and was determined to have a try. Therefore, An Qian took the bottle. “Thanks! Text your bank account to me and I’ll transfer the money to you.”

“No need. Take it as a gift from me to your father,” Gu Ning said airily.

“What?” An Qian was surprised. The pill cost a million yuan! However, Gu Ning didn’t care. A million yuan was a lot of money for the An Family, but An Qian’s father who was a medical expert was very curious about it.

“No-no, it costs a million yuan, so I can’t take it for free,” An Qian said.

“It’s true that this pill is quite effective, but I got those pills without paying a cent myself. I don’t rely on them to make money either, so you don’t need to feel guilty at all. If you want to pay me back, you can let my uncle stay in the hospital for free instead,” Gu Ning said.

“Well...” An Qian still felt a little guilty.

“Alright, we’re good friends after all,” Gu Ning said, and pretended to be displeased. “If you reject me once more, I’ll take it back.”

An Qian opened her mouth, but didn’t say another word to reject Gu Ning. It was impossible for her to go back home with empty hands, because her father would be furious.

“Thank you so much!” An Qian said, “Please allow me to buy you a meal when you’re free.”

“No problem!” Gu Ning agreed.

An Qian left afterwards.

Gu Ning told Gu Qing and Wang Sufen that they could leave if they felt tired, but they were worried about Gu Man, so neither of them were willing to leave right now.

After a long while, Gu Man was still in the patient room. It wasn’t early, so Gu Ning told Gu Qing to buy some food for them. Wang Sufen followed Gu Qing outside.

Gu Man alone stayed in the patient room for nearly an hour before she calmed herself down and went out. She seemed haggard with swollen, red eyes after crying in worry about Tang Yunfan.

Gu Ning immediately poured a glass of water for Gu Man, and secretly put a power crystal inside.

With the help of the power crystal, Gu Man felt much better after, and her swollen, red eyes soon went back to normal.

“Ningning, does his family know that he had a car accident?” Gu Man asked.

“Not yet, but his secretary knows and is on his way here,” Gu Ning said.

Gu Man nodded and stopped asking. Instead, she sat aside with an absent look.

“I asked aunt to buy some food for us. Do you want to go back home after eating or stay here to keep him company?” Gu Ning asked. Actually, she already knew Gu Man’s answer.

“I’ll stay here!” Gu Man said without hesitation. Tang Yunfan was still unconscious, and she couldn’t sleep soundly if he was in danger.

Before long, Gu Qing and Wang Sufen were back.

After the meal, it was already past 6 pm. Gu Ning then told Gu Qing and Wang Sufen to go back home and that she would stay here with Gu Man.

Gu Qing was really curious about the relationship between Gu Man and the man, but she decided to wait to ask until Gu Man was home.

Gu Man gave Wang Sufen the key to her home because she trusted Wang Sufen.

Gu Qing wasn’t able to see Tang Yunfan’s face or she wouldn’t have been so calm, because Gu Ning closely resembled Tang Yunfan.

When Gu Qing and Wang Sufen had just left, An Guangming walked inside. He came here to see whether Gu Ning needed help. Although he was eager to ask her about the medicine, he knew that it wasn’t the right time, so he didn’t mention it.

Before An Guangming went off-duty, he repeatedly thanked Gu Ning for sending him the pill as a gift.

Around 6:30 pm, Tang Yunfan’s phone rang, and the caller was Quan Mingkai. Gu Ning directly picked it up.

“Miss Gu, how is Chairman Tang now?” Once Gu Ning answered the phone, Quan Mingkai asked her anxiously.

“He’s fine now but still unconscious,” Gu Ning said.

“I’m in City F now, and I’ll be right there,” Quan Mingkai said. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Great,” Gu Ning said, then hung up.

Half an hour later, Quan Mingkai arrived.

“Nice to meet you, Miss Gu!” Quan Mingkai greeted Gu Ning politely, because he knew that she was Tang Yunfan’s biological daughter. Only Tang Yunfan and he knew the secret in the Tang Family right now, but he had respect for Gu Ning because of her real identity. In addition, he didn’t know whether Gu Ning had found out about her own real identity yet, so he stilled called her “Miss Gu”.

“Nice to meet you too, Mr. Quan!” Gu Ning greeted him.

Quan Mingkai used to think that only Tang Yunfan and him knew the secret that Gu Ning was Tang Yunfan’s biological daughter, but he changed his mind when he saw Gu Man. He had seen Gu Man’s picture, so he recognized her face when she appeared in his sight.

Since Gu Man was here she must have met Tang Yunfan, and she had surely recognized him! Even though they hadn’t met each other for 18 years, Tang Yunfan’s appearance didn’t change a lot. However, Quan Mingkai wasn’t very certain about it, because 18 years wasn’t a short time.

However, if Gu Man hadn’t recognized Tang Yunfan, she wouldn’t have been so sad and worried. Anyway, although Quan Mingkai believed that Gu Man had already recognized Tang Yunfan, he decided to pretend that he didn’t know, because the two hadn’t accepted each other as family yet. “I bet you must be Miss Gu’s mother, Madam?” he asked politely.

Gu Ning noticed Quan Mingkai’s unusual reaction when he saw Gu Man, so she guessed that he knew Gu Man but pretended that he didn’t.

“Yes, this is my mother, Gu Man.” Gu Ning introduced. “Mom, this is Mr. Quan.”

“Nice to meet you!”

“Nice to meet you too!” they greeted one another, then walked to the patient room together.

Seeing Tang Yunfan unconscious, Quan Mingkai didn’t know what to do.

“Miss Gu, thank you so much! If it hadn’t been for you, the situation could be worse,” Quan Mingkai said to Gu Ning seriously. No matter whether Gu Ning knew that Tang Yunfan was her biological father, as Tang Yunfan’s secretary, Quan Mingkai ought to thank her on behalf of his boss.
