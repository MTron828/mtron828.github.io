Even though Miss Fang went to sit in the economy class, she was still really afraid and couldn’t relax.

She didn’t feel relieved until Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting left after the plane landed at the airport of City Qing.

She was mad at them, but couldn’t do anything now.

...

City Qing was the capital city of Province Qing.

However, City Qing wasn’t their destination. They were heading through City Ge to the Door to Hell.

City Ge was near Kunlun Mountain, but they still needed to take a car for almost two hours to reach it.

Kunlun Mountain wasn’t a single mountain, it was a mountain chain, and it spanned three provinces. As for the Door to Hell, it also occupied a huge area.

Leng Shaoting had never been to the place where his parents were caught in the accident that year, so he asked for many details from one of his father’s previous subordinates before he came here. It was impossible for them to find the place on their own.

His father’s loyal subordinates were now the Leng family’s supporters, and they all held an important position in the military. They obeyed Leng Shaoting’s orders, and respected the other members of the Leng family too.

Some of them ranked higher than Leng Shaoting, but none of them took him lightly, because Leng Shaoting was a much younger major general than them. In addition, they relied on Leng Shaoting’s influence to maintain their positions in the army.

Leng Shaoting always stayed alone, but he had helped a lot of people before, so he had powerful connections now. Given Leng Shaoting’s family background, countless people wanted to join his circle.

Because there was no direct line from the capital to City Ge, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting had to go to City Qing first. And they would transfer to City Ge from City Qing.

When they reached City Qing, it was about 4:30 pm. Around 6 pm, they would board the plane to City Ge. They spent most of their time in a plane today.

Because they already had dined in the plane, they weren’t hungry now and left to go look at a car in a car dealership. It was more convenient for them to drive a car themselves to Kunlun Mountain.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting decided to buy a car instead of renting one, because only an off-road vehicle could satisfy their needs. And normally, only ordinary cars were available to be rented, so they made up their mind to directly buy a car.

It could save them a lot of effort if they drove their own car.

There was a car in Gu Ning’s telepathic eye space, but it was a private car and not suitable for mountain roads.

Because Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting needed to use a car tomorrow, they had to pick up a car right now. In the end, they chose a Hummer, which cost a million yuan, and they didn’t hesitate to pay the full amount. However, right when Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were about to drive the car away, a young man suddenly ran inside and stopped them.

“This car is mine, you can’t buy it,” said the young man.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting turned to look at the manager with confusion, and the manager seemed astonished when he saw the young man. It was obvious that the young man’s words were true.

Gu Ning was displeased. “What’s going on here?”

“Well, this car was booked for him, but he didn’t want it when the car arrived, so I returned his deposit,” the manager said.

Actually, the young man couldn’t get his deposit back if the car he booked had already arrived, but he was from a powerful family so the manager didn’t dare to annoy him.

Coincidentally, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting liked this car too.

Nevertheless, the young man was arrogant and selfish, and he didn’t care about Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s feelings at all.

“I think you shouldn’t come back now after we’ve already paid the full amount. This car is ours,” Gu Ning said.

“I just changed my mind, and I want it now,” the young man said.

“So? Let me be honest with you, it’s impossible!” Gu Ning said.

“You...” The young man suddenly turned to threaten the manager. “Manager Hu, get this car back for me, or your business will have to close!”

The manager was scared, because he wasn’t the owner of this car dealership. Therefore, he said to Gu Ning, “Miss Gu, I’m terribly sorry, but could you please buy another car? There are many other good cars in our store.”

“No, I want this one,” Gu Ning said.

Neither Gu Ning nor Leng Shaoting were willing to give in. They needed the car right now, and they had already paid the money.
