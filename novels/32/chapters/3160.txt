3162 Meet by Chance

Seeing that the police didn’t believe her, Jin Yiai was furious and wanted to become violent, but she couldn’t do anything about it without evidence.

However, she believed it must have something to do with Leng Xiaoyao, so she wouldn’t forgive her.

Although she didn’t know Leng Xiaoyao’s name and background, she could find it through Shen Xiyin since Leng Xiaoyao was Shen Xiyin’s friend.

She believed it shouldn’t be difficult.

…

Leng Xiaoyao arrived at the airport of City Yun after two hours of flight.

Jiang Han and Mu Fan were already waiting for them in a car. Once Leng Xiaoyao and the others arrived, they went to pick them up.

Jiang Han and Mu Fan were surprised to see two women with Li Mochen. Li Mochen had told them to prepare a larger car because he had several friends, but he didn’t say that his friends were women. They thought they were all men.

After all, they had never seen Li Mochen with women before, not to mention that they looked very close.

Jiang Han and Mo Fan were Li Mochen’s assistants, so Leng Xiaoyao recognized them. In the previous incarnation, she was spied on by them in turns.

They were terrible to Leng Xiaoyao back then, but they still had manners and didn’t humiliate her. No matter what, Leng Xiaoyao was Li Mochen’s wife at that time. If they dared to humiliate Leng Xiaoyao, Li Mochen would be embarrassed too.

Anyway, she didn’t harbor grudges against them no matter what they did to her before.

“B-Boss, this is…” Mu Fan asked. He was curious about Leng Xiaoyao’s relationship with Li Mochen.

“She is Leng Xiaoyao. She’s going to City Li with us. The other woman is her friend,” Li Mochen said. He appeared quite close when he introduced Leng Xiaoyao.

“Nice to meet you!” Jiang Han and Mu Fan greeted Leng Xiaoyao and Shen Xiyin at once.

Before Leng Xiaoyao and Shen Xiyin responded, Li Mochen said, “These two are my subordinates, Jiang Han and Mu Fan.”

“Nice to meet you too.” Leng Xiaoyao replied.

“Nice to meet you.” Shen Xiyin followed.

Afterwards, they got in the car together and left the airport.

“Brother Mochen, don’t we need to wait for Mr. Mu?” asked Leng Xiaoyao. They agreed to gather at the airport of City Yun, but they left first.

“No need, he has his own arrangements,” Li Mochen said.

Because Mu Yiyang came with six of his comrades, they had their own schedule. After Mu Yiyang was done, he would come to meet them.

Jiang Han and Mu Fan, however, were astonished when they heard how Leng Xiaoyao called Li Mochen. Brother Mochen? Were they so close?

Most importantly, Li Mochen said nothing and replied kindly.

In addition, Leng Xiaoyao was also familiar with Mu Yiyang.

In that case, Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t be an ordinary person.

In fact, for those who were unfamiliar with Li Mochen, he still sounded cold when he spoke to Leng Xiaoyao, but people who were familiar with him understood that he was unusually kind today. It was the first time that they had ever seen him talk to a girl so gently.

Li Mochen always kept a distance from other people. Because he was raised to be the heir, he barely had emotions.

After he grew up, he risked his life with his subordinates many times, then started having emotions, but it only existed among close brothers, including loyalty and responsibility. However, he had never been in a romantic relationship. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Due to his status and background, he wasn’t allowed to have a romantic relationship, because he would only hurt his love.

In the previous incarnation, he secretly sent many people to protect Leng Xiaoyao and kept his background a secret, but he simply did that to fulfill his duty.

Half an hour later, they arrived at the restaurant chosen by Jiang Han and Mu Fan. Then they had a meal.

After the meal, Leng Xiaoyao left with Shen Xiyin.

When they were gone, Mu Fan asked Li Mochen about his relationship with Leng Xiaoyao.

Li Mochen said they were friends, so Mu Fan didn’t dare to ask further about that, but he felt they were more than just friends. However, there didn’t seem to be chemistry between them.

Anyway, they must have an unusual relationship and got along very well.

…

After Leng Xiaoyao and Shen Xiyin left, Leng Xiaoyao took out the jade pendant she got from An Chenmeng and Shen Xiyin put it on.

They didn’t go to the Shen family’s mansion right away, but found where Shen Xiyin’s aunt, Shen Yamei, was first. They planned to create a coincidental meeting.

Leng Xiaoyao found that Shen Yamei was hanging out with her friends in a shopping mall, and they were dining in a restaurant currently.

Without delay, Leng Xiaoyao and Shen Xiyin went to the shopping mall.

When they arrived, Shen Yamei was still in the restaurant, but they had finished eating. Currently, they sat there resting and gossiping.

Leng Xiaoyao and Shen Xiyin walked inside. Because there were vacant seats beside Shen Xiyin, they walked towards her. The next moment, they pretended to notice Shen Xiyin and greeted her.

“Hi, aunt, what a coincidence!” Shen Xiyin said to Shen Yamei.

Shen Yamei was surprised to see Shen Xiyin because she didn’t know that Shen Xiyin came home.

“Xiyin, when did you come home?” Shen Xiyin asked after coming back to her senses.

Subconsciously, Shen Yamei looked at Shen Xiyin’s neck. She saw the jade pendant she sent to Shen Xiyin, then she stared at Shen Xiyin’s face, but she didn’t see anything wrong.

As a result, Shen Yamei frowned a little with confusion.

Shen Xiyin couldn’t see the difference in Shen Yamei’s expression, but Shen Xiyin saw it clearly.

She wasn’t very sure, but believed that Shen Yamei was aware of the problem with this jade pendant.

“I just arrived. I brought my friend home to have a tour. My friend didn’t bring many clothes, so we came to shop. We haven’t eaten yet either, so we decided to have a meal. I didn’t expect to see you, aunt,” Shen Xiyin said.

Afterwards, Shen Xiyin turned to the two rich ladies sitting opposite Shen Yamei. “Nice to see you, Mrs. Lin, and Mrs. Wang.”

They were Shen Yamei’s friends, but they were all members of high society, so they were familiar with one another.

“Nice to see you too, Miss Shen.” the two rich ladies replied politely.

...

“Since we met, why don’t you sit down and order some food. I’ll pay the bill,” Shen Yamei suggested. She seemed nice, but she was actually upset.
