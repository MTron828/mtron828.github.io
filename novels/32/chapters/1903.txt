Chapter 1905: Vampires

As soon as Leng Shaoting walked in about 10 meters, he heard a voice coming from the inside. It was a male voice, and it spoke Language M.

“After sucking so much blood, I finally recovered.”

Leng Shaoting looked serious when he heard those words in Language M.

People from Country M. Suck blood? Could they be vampires?

Leng Shaoting had this idea because Gu Ning had told him that there could be mutants and vampires in this world.

Vampires survived by drinking the blood of humans or other creatures.

Under normal circumstances, there wasn’t a big difference between vampires and ordinary people. The only difference was that vampires’ skin was much whiter than that of ordinary people. After all, they weren’t really living people.

Their eyes were brownish red. Only when fighting or sucking blood would they reveal their true colors. The original face of a vampire was pale with blood red eyes and sharp fangs.

Vampires were afraid of the sunlight, so they usually moved at night. In the daytime, they had to be completely disguised.

“Right, I didn’t expect to run into such strong people in this country. we were almost caught this time,” said another voice.

Strong people?

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting thought of cultivators. After all, vampires were also very powerful. No matter how good an ordinary person was, he or she was no match for vampires.

There might be some ordinary people who could beat vampires, but the probability was quite low.

“Yeah, they could even fly all over.”

Upon hearing that, Leng Shaoting was sure that they were talking about cultivators.

“We must go back and report it to our leader as soon as possible...” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Hearing that, coldness appeared in Leng Shaoting’s eyes. Since he already found them, it was impossible for them to go back to report it to their leader.

Without hesitation, Leng Shaoting walked inside.

50 meters from the cave’s entrance there was nothing special. The space was about 30 square meters and the height was about 7 meters. There were a few stones on the ground, and two foreign men sat on the stones at will.

The two men were both between 25 to 35 years old and their clothes were torn and had a lot of blood stains.

The two men weren’t ordinary people, so they had acute senses as well. They discovered it when Leng Shaoting was within 10 meters near them. Leng Shaoting didn’t hold his breath, and only walked forward lightly.

Seeing someone coming in, the two foreign men exchanged a glance, then immediately got up and hid behind a big stone. They were worried that the powerful man had come.

Leng Shaoting heard the movements from the inside, but he didn’t need to find them with his senses, because the smell of blood on them was too strong. He could smell it from a distance.

Leng Shaoting went into the cave, then raised his hand to use magical energy to hit the big stone in front of the two men.

The two men felt a strong attack, which was extremely oppressive.

This strong force wasn’t strange to them, because the powerful people they had met before had also released such a force at them, but obviously it was much stronger this time.

Therefore, the two men wanted to avoid it, but it was too late. With a boom, the big rock in front of them suddenly broke into pieces, and some small stones hit them directly, knocking them to the ground.

The next second, they spewed blood, because they couldn’t resist the strong attack towards their bodies. However, because they were vampires, they still maintained the ability to fight back even though they were injured by the strong force. Their strength was only slightly weakened.

They knew they were no match for Leng Shaoting, so they had to fight with their full strength in order to survive. As a result, the two men got back to their feet at once to attack Leng Shaoting.

They already noticed that Leng Shaoting was wearing a military uniform and knew that he was a soldier, so they had to flee and not let him catch them, otherwise it would become big trouble.

Unfortunately, Leng Shaoting was even stronger than the powerful people they had met earlier. They failed in the previous fight, so it was impossible for them to defeat Leng Shaoting. Accordingly, Leng Shaoting easily injured them.

Although Leng Shaoting couldn’t control them right away, the two men couldn’t even touch his clothes during the fight, let alone hurt him.

After a while, the two vampires were out of strength and were caught by Leng Shaoting.

Because they were caught, the two vampires were afraid.

“Tell me why did you come to our country?” Leng Shaoting asked them in Language M.

Leng Shaoting was a soldier, but he wasn’t a regular soldier. He was skilled at different languages, because it was necessary for him to hide and protect himself.

The two vampires remained silent, and Leng Shaoting stayed calm.

“Well, if you refuse to tell, I’ll send you to the embassy of Country M,” said Leng Shaoting.

Hearing that, the two vampires panicked. If they were sent to the embassy, it wouldn’t be a personal problem anymore, the whole vampire family might become involved. Therefore, a vampire said in a hurry, “We came here to search for a person.”

“To search for a person? What person?” asked Leng Shaoting. He didn’t expect them to tell him the truth.

“The person who owes us money. He owes us a lot of money and he fled to your country,” said another vampire.

“What’s his name?” asked Leng Shaoting.

“Cruise,” said a vampire, but it was a fake name.

Leng Shaoting refused to believe him.

“No matter what your purpose is, you’ve killed 23 people in our country, so you still need to go to the embassy with me,” said Leng Shaoting.

“You...” The two men were surprised. They were surprised that Leng Shaoting insisted on taking them to the embassy and that he knew those people were killed by them.

After all, those people died a strange death, while they looked almost the same as human beings. How did Leng Shaoting know those people were killed by them?

“You must be wrong.”

Even though they really did that, they still tried to deny it.

“I’m not! I heard your conversation just now. I know you’re not human beings, but vampires,” said Leng Shaoting. He didn’t bother to hide the fact that he was aware of their real species.

Hearing that, the two vampires were totally shocked. To their astonishment, Leng Shaoting knew that they were vampires.

At this moment, the two vampires honestly had no idea how to defend themselves, and they also realized that they were doomed.

After exchanging a glance with each other, they quickly pressed a button on the side of the watches on their wrists. Leng Shaoting had a premonition, but it was too late for him to stop them.

With a loud bang, the two vampires exploded in an instant, without a bone left, while Leng Shaoting was also instantly pushed 10 meters away.
