3432 It’s Too Scary

On Sunday, Tang Xing and his sister didn’t have extracurricular tutoring, so when Leng Xiaoyao and Shen Xiyin went to the company, they also took the Tang siblings with them. However, just as they left Hanlin Manor, Leng Xiaoyao discovered that they were being followed.

Lao Gui found out Leng Xiaoyao’s identity overnight.

She was a 19-year-old freshman at the Capital University. She was born in City Chang, lived in Hanlin Manor and owned a company called Xiaoyao Technology. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As for her background, there was nothing extraordinary about it.

However, Brother Bao believed that a 19-year-old girl couldn’t have started such a company in the capital city without someone’s help. Perhaps Leng Xiaoyao was just a figurehead.

Anyway, based on what they had learned from their investigation, it wasn’t worth Brother Bao’s fear. Therefore, he immediately sent some people to follow Leng Xiao and find an opportunity to abduct her.

Leng Xiaoyao immediately used her magical senses to see who was following her. Her magical senses were stable now, so she could directly use them to check things, just like the night they used them to investigate the account book in Tang Lei’s safe. They were similar to Jade Eyes.

She not only saw them with her magical senses, but also heard them talking. Finally, she knew why they were targeting her – they were interested in her!

Humph! It was impossible for them to hurt her!

Because they hadn’t taken action yet, she couldn’t take action against them either because as a cultivator, she couldn’t harm mortals. It would damage her Yin virtue due to karmic consequences.

If they attacked her first, she could defend herself without consequences. However, killing wasn’t allowed.

Not only because of the Heavenly rules, but also because Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to kill randomly.

Although she wouldn’t harm them first, she didn’t want to be followed all the time. Therefore, she decided to give them a chance to show themselves.

“We are being followed, or I should say I’m being followed. So we are not going to the company now. Instead, let’s lead them to a place with fewer people and see what they want,” Leng Xiaoyao said to Shen Xiyin.

Shen Xiyin was shocked when she heard that. “Could it be that someone is jealous of the company’s success and wants to harm you?”

“I don’t know.” Leng Xiaoyao really couldn’t tell. Although she knew that they were interested in her, she didn’t know why they came after her.

Tang Xing and Tang Ning were worried because they didn’t know Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities. Leng Xiaoyao noticed, but didn’t comfort them.

She drove the car towards a remote location, and the people following her didn’t suspect anything.

It wasn’t until they arrived at a park that Leng Xiaoyao stopped the car, and the people following her thought that she was there for a walk.

It was around 9 am, and some people were walking in the park, but they weren’t enough to make those men afraid to act.

“You all stay in the car. Don’t get out, understand?” Before getting out of the car, Leng Xiaoyao reminded them.

“Okay.” Shen Xiyin responded. She knew that Leng Xiaoyao was powerful and wouldn’t be injured.

Tang Xing and Tang Ning were still worried. “Sister…”

“Don’t worry! I’ll be fine.” Leng Xiaoyao comforted them.

Tang Xing and Tang Ning were relieved. They had blind faith in Leng Xiaoyao.

The men who followed them parked their car next to Leng Xiaoyao’s car and surrounded her as soon as she got out of the car.

Lao Gui brought three men with him. Once they got out of the car, they surrounded Leng Xiaoyao in the middle.

“What do you want?” Leng Xiaoyao looked at them calmly.

Lao Gui saw that she was calm and became nervous. Obviously, she wasn’t afraid of them.

Lao Gui wasn’t afraid either. He smiled and said, “Our boss likes you and wants to keep you.”

“Ridiculous!” Upon hearing that, Leng Xiaoyao laughed. “Keep me? What does he think he is?”

Lao Gui and his men became mad.

Lao Gui said, “Our boss isn’t someone you can offend. We’ve collected information about you. You’re from City Chang and you are currently a freshman at the Capital University. You have a technology company called Xiaoyao Technology. So, if you don’t agree with my boss, my boss can easily destroy your company and ruin you!”

Leng Xiaoyao was immediately displeased. He came prepared!

However, so what? She wasn’t afraid.

“Oh! Who is your boss?” Leng Xiaoyao narrowed her eyes. She had already learned from her magical senses just then that the person was called Brother Bao, but she didn’t know who he was.

“My boss is someone in the underworld. Everyone calls him Brother Bao. I can tell you that in the capital city, there are not many people who dare to offend Brother Bao.” Lao Gui threatened, with a proud face. He believed that Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t dare to resist.

“But I’ve never offended him. It’s you who came to cause trouble for me,” Leng Xiaoyao said with a sinister expression.

“So what? Brother Bao gets the woman he wants!” Lao Gui said.

“Really?” Leng Xiaoyao sneered. “Then let’s see what you can do.”

Lao Gui squinted at Leng Xiaoyao. Could it be that she really wasn’t afraid?

“Are you sure you want us to use violence?” Lao Gui asked.

“That depends on whether you have the ability or not!” Leng Xiaoyao said, provoking them to make the first move.

“Humph! Since that’s the case, don’t regret it!” Lao Gui snorted and immediately ordered a few lackeys to attack Leng Xiaoyao.

However, before they could even get close to Leng Xiaoyao, they were hit and flew several meters away. They fell to the ground and were in so much pain that they couldn’t even get up.

They were all surprised. How could Leng Xiaoyao be so powerful?

Originally, Tang Xing and his sister were still worried, so when they witnessed that scene, they were surprised and excited.

Their sister was unbelievable!

“W-Who are you really?” Lao Gui asked. He felt that Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t simple. If she was simple, she wouldn’t be able to knock them out with one blow.

“Who am I? Didn’t you collect information about me already?” Leng Xiaoyao sneered and walked towards them.

“Don’t come over! If you dare to hurt us, Brother Bao won’t let you go.” Lao Gui threatened. He was frightened by Leng Xiaoyao.

This woman was too terrifying.

“I already hurt you, didn’t I? Even if I let you go now, will you let me go?” Leng Xiaoyao sneered. She didn’t believe that they would let her go.

Lao Gui blinked, then said, “We’ll let you go. We’ll definitely let you go.”

Leng Xiaoyao saw through Lao Gui. She didn’t believe him.
