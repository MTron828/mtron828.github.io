3129 It Can’t Be Easier to Make Money

In that case, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t need to lose money on purpose and she began to bet at long odds.

Once the numbers became high, Qin Wentao and his friends lost all of their chips within a few rounds.

Qin Wentao and his friends were completely amazed by Leng Xiaoyao’s gambling skills. They had never seen anyone who could do that before. Even the King of Gamblers might not be as skilled as Leng Xiaoyao.

It was hard for Qin Wentao to accept. “No, it’s impossible. How could this happen?”

“Anything is possible. This is my ability,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“You must have played tricks. Otherwise you wouldn’t be able to win so much money every time,” Qin Wentao exclaimed. He didn’t believe it was just Leng Xiaoyao’s ability. She must have played tricks!

“Oh, you and Mr. Ji are friends, so he must have helped you,” one of Qin Wentao’s friends said. He was talking about the banker.

Although Qin Wentao arranged for the banker to host the gambling, he believed that the banker must have sided with Leng Xiaoyao because Leng Xiaoyao and Ji Yanxi were friends.

Qin Wentao didn’t want to lose ten million yuan this time, but he had to pay it, so he was angry.

Qin Wentao didn’t expect to have to pay this time, because he believed that he could win and bet chips on it. If he won, he could get ten million yuan.

However, if Qin Wentao won, his friends would only get a little money for helping him.

“If you can’t bear the result, don’t gamble. Since you took part in the game, don’t try to get away from it. I bet your friends must have heard that a woman has won twenty million yuan here not long again. To be honest with you, the woman is me. Back then, I didn’t know Mr. Li at all. No one would allow me to play tricks,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

People in Fengyun Casino were all aware of that, so they were surprised when Leng Xiaoyao said that she was the woman. They didn’t expect her to be the woman who had won twenty million yuan in their casino.

They also knew that the woman was asked to meet their manager after winning twenty million yuan, but she still left safely with the money in the end.

Qin Wentao and his friends were astonished. They couldn’t imagine that Leng Xiaoyao had already won twenty million at Fengyun Casino before. In that case, Ling Tianqi clearly knew her gambling skills and called her over to compete against them.

It couldn’t be more obvious.

Qin Wentao was unwilling to accept the result, but he understood that he couldn’t do anything about it. As a result, he had to leave in embarrassment.

This time, he lost twenty million yuan, because he paid for the employee from Fengyun Casino to help him.

If the employee lost, he would pay the money. If the employee won, he would give him one third of the money as remuneration.

Originally, he believed he would win, so he came here, but unexpectedly he lost.

Even though he lost, he still paid the employee the remuneration which was only a couple of thousand yuan. It was what they had agreed on, so the employee didn’t complain about it.

He also wanted to win, but he couldn’t change the result.

Because it was private gambling, they could exchange chips for money no matter how much they won. They wouldn’t be stopped from leaving.

They only needed to pay a couple thousand yuan for the private room, which they had already done when they booked the private room. Therefore, they could directly exchange their chips for money now.

…

Lu Lin went back a few minutes later. Then he told Han Yu and the others that he met Leng Xiaoyao.

Han Yu appeared here since he had almost made a full recovery. They had gathered to celebrate it.

Because Han Yu just recovered, he couldn’t drink and they didn’t go to his bar. They came to the casino after having a meal and had fun by gambling at short odds.

When they heard that Leng Xiaoyao was here, they all wanted to see her, but they didn’t go straight to her. Instead, they told Lu Lin to wait outside their private room. They would invite Leng Xiaoyao to come over after the other people were gone.

Therefore, once Leng Xiaoyao walked out, she saw Lu Lin. Lu Lin said, “Miss Leng, my boss heard that you are here and invited you to gather together for a while.”

“Sure. Will you go home, or wait for me for a while?” Leng Xiaoyao asked Ling Tianqi and the others.

“We’ll just wait for you for a while in the private room,” Ling Tianqi said. They called Leng Xiaoyao over, so they wouldn’t leave before her.

“Great.” Leng Xiaoyao answered, then left with Lu Lin. Ling Tianqi and the others stayed in their private room.

Because they had paid the money, they could enjoy themselves as long as they wanted. There were also desserts, so they weren’t bored.

In addition to Leng Xiaoyao’s ten million yuan, they had won twenty million yuan. Although only Ling Tianqi and Pei Heran joined in the game, they wouldn’t keep the money to themselves.

Because of Leng Xiaoyao, they would undoubtedly win no matter who joined in the game. Therefore, Ling Tianqi shared the money with his friends. Each of his friends received 5.5 million yuan.

However, his friends didn’t accept it because they didn’t think they were helpful. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After all, it was a lot of money and they felt that they shouldn’t take the money which didn’t belong to them.

However, Ling Tianqi and Pei Heran insisted, so they accepted it in the end.

…

When Leng Xiaoyao and Lu Lin reached the private room where Han Yu and the others were, they all stood up to welcome her.

“Miss Leng, nice to see you. Have a seat.”

Although Leng Xiaoyao was a young girl, they didn’t think she was ordinary. Instead, she had left a deep impression on them. They attached great importance to her.

“My friend had a gambling match here. I came to help, but the competitors are too terrible at gambling. They lost all their money within twenty minutes,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Then she went to sit down on the sofa.

She sounded very arrogant, but it was the truth. Because they all knew Leng Xiaoyao’s skills, they didn’t think her attitude was wrong.

“Oh, how much did you win, Miss Leng?” asked Ji Yanxi curiously.

“Ten million yuan,” said Leng Xiaoyao.

Even if they were aware of Leng Xiaoyao’s skills, they were still shocked when they heard that she had won ten million yuan. They felt it couldn’t be easier for her to make money!

“Well, I think it’s incredibly easy for you to make money, Miss Leng. Within twenty minutes, you’ve made ten million yuan.” Ji Yanxi was amazed. He felt Leng Xiaoyao could handle everything well.
