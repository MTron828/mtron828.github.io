Although there were sightseeing cars, they might not meet them as soon as they went out. Sometimes they would need to wait for a while.

It was fine to walk occasionally, but for people who went to work or school every day, it was unbearable.

Although it was a normal conversation, it sounded ambiguous to An Chenmeng and the others.

They now felt that Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen were having an affair. What should they do?

The next day, when Leng Xiaoyao went out, An Chenmeng and the others hadn’t gotten up yet. Because Leng Xiaoyao was going out today, they had to have lunch by themselves.

They were all young ladies who didn’t know how to cook, so it was impossible for them to do it themselves. Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao told them to go out to eat and she would reimburse them. Before going out, she also left the key for them so that they wouldn’t be locked out.

“Brother Mochen, won’t it delay your time?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“It won’t,” Li Mochen said.

“Great,” Leng Xiaoyao said relievedly. If she delayed Li Mochen’s business, she would feel bad.

“I caused some trouble for the Li family before. It has eased a bit these days, so I’m worried that they will come after you. Although I have someone watching them, accidents can happen. I am not worried about you being alone. I believe you can handle it, but I am afraid that you won’t have time to take care of your friends. I’m involved in this matter, so I may have to follow you these days until they leave.” Li Mochen expressed his guilt.

Leng Xiaoyao thought for a moment. “You’re right. I am not afraid to be alone, but I am afraid they will go after Chenmeng and the others. I can’t guarantee that I can keep an eye on all of them.”

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t see the slight smile on Li Mochen’s lips, which was obviously a triumphant look.

When they arrived at the construction site, Wu Wensi was also there.

Wu Wensi was surprised to see Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen coming. “Mocheng, Xiaoyao, what are you doing here?”

“Well, I brought my friends to visit the capital city. They are tired and need to rest today, so I came to take a look,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

After three weeks, the partitions, water and electricity were ready, and they were now tiling.

After tiling, they would do the ceiling, then painting.

After the painting was done, they could start decorating, installing the lighting and office supplies.

Wu Wensi had his own store for these things, so everything was ordered from there.

As for the grade, Leng Xiaoyao used high-end products. After all, as long as the business was booming, she wasn’t afraid of not making money.

…

When An Chenmeng and the others woke up, it was already 12 pm. They tidied up and went out to eat.

Although Leng Xiaoyao said she would reimburse them, it wasn’t necessary for her to do so for a meal. She had already spent a lot of money taking them out to have fun.

While they were wandering around the block, they looked for food to eat.

However, before they could decide what to eat, they ran into trouble.

They didn’t expect to meet the girl, Jiang Xiaoxiao, who had a conflict with them outside the Capital University, on this block.

Jiang Xiaoxiao was surprised to see them and her expression became angry.

Jiang Xiaoxiao subconsciously observed them for a while, then felt relieved when she didn’t see Leng Xiaoyao.

“What are you doing here?” asked Jiang Xiaoxiao in an unpleasant tone.

An Chenmeng replied with a cold smile. “If you can be here, why can’t we?”

“Because I live here,” Jiang Xiaoxiao said arrogantly. She didn’t believe that they lived here too. When she said that she lived here, she implied that her family had high status.

“My friend lives here,” An Chenmeng said.

Friend?

Jiang Xiaoxiao didn’t think it could be Leng Xiaoyao, because she lived in City Chang and couldn’t afford a house here.

“Humph! I thought you’re rich! Turns out you’re just staying at a friend’s place! Well, I guess you can’t afford a house here. It’s probably around 40-50 million for one!” Jiang Xiaoxiao sneered, feeling even more superior.

“Hah! It sounds as if you could afford it. You still live with your parents. If you have the ability, why don’t you buy one without using your parents’ money? If you can afford it, I’ll even kneel down and call you boss!” An Chenmeng scoffed disdainfully.

“You…” Jiang Xiaoxiao was angry. She obviously couldn’t buy one on her own.

“She always threatens other people with her family’s influence. It’s impossible for her to afford a house here. Don’t judge her.” Xiong Manxin seemed to be defending Jiang Xiaoxiao, but was only adding fuel to the fire.

“You…” Jiang Xiaoxiao was furious. She didn’t know how to retort. After all, she couldn’t win the argument against so many of them. After a glare at them, she turned around and walked away.

She wanted to beat them, but her home was nearby, so she didn’t dare to cause a scene.

“Ha, I thought she would do something! Turns out she’s just a coward,” Wu Minmin said contemptuously.

“Alright, let’s go eat! I’m starving!” Tong Xiaobei shouted.

…

At noon, Leng Xiaoyao had lunch with Wu Wensi, then went home.

Meanwhile, Li Mochen didn’t dare to express his feelings to Leng Xiaoyao yet. He wanted to see if he would have the urge to kiss her after staring at her for three seconds.

However, it wasn’t the right time. He wanted to wait until her classmates left.

“How many days do your classmates want to stay?” Li Mochen asked.

“About five or six.” Leng Xiaoyao replied with uncertainty.

“Will you go back with them?” Li Mochen asked. That was the most important thing.

“I probably won’t. I plan to get my driver’s license. By the way, do you know anyone at the driving school? Can I take the test all at once?” Leng Xiaoyao asked. Her driving skills were unquestionable, so she didn’t want to waste time brushing up on her skills with regular students.

“Yes, I do. You can take the test all at once. I’ll help you arrange it.” Li Mochen readily agreed. He was also relieved to hear that Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t be going back with her classmates.

“Great.” Leng Xiaoyao smiled sweetly at him, momentarily stunning Li Mochen and making him almost lose his composure.

“Let’s cook at home tonight! We can go to the supermarket first,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Okay,” Li Mochen replied and drove the car to the supermarket.

Leng Xiaoyao was browsing and selecting items at the front, while Li Mochen pushed the cart behind. Suddenly, Li Mochen felt a sense of peacefulness, as if time had stood still. A warm feeling grew inside him.

Leng Xiaoyao turned around and met Li Mochen’s gaze. The soft feeling made Leng Xiaoyao’s heart beat faster.

Li Mochen also felt his heart racing and quickly looked away.

The two of them didn’t say anything and continued walking forward. However, both of them were absent-minded.

Fortunately, they finished shopping soon and went straight to check out.
