3066 Because I’m Not Familiar with You

Pei Heran and Feng Rui were relieved too. They knew their abilities. If they joined in the race, they would only be a drag on Ling Tianqi.

Therefore, they didn’t feel displeased at all when Leng Xiaoyao and Mu Yiyang replaced them. Instead, they felt very lucky that Leng Xiaoyao and Mu Yiyang were here today.

Qin Wentao didn’t know Si Yiqi, so he had no idea how good Si Yiqi was at car racing. Anyway, he bet they were better than Pei Heran and Feng Rui.

As a result, he became alert.

“Do you agree? Even if you disagree, it’s useless. After all, it was you who said that we can make a team randomly,” Leng Xiaoyao said, challenging them.

“Since I said that, of course I agree,” Qin Wentao said in annoyance.

“What’s the bet?” Ling Tianqi asked.

“We can bet money this time. Each person bets ten million yuan. If you win, you can get thirty million yuan from us. If you lose, we’ll get thirty million yuan from you. What do you think?” Qin Wentao said.

“No problem. If we lose, I’ll pay thirty million yuan. If we win, we can share the money,” Ling Tianqi said. Although he didn’t think he would lose now that Leng Xiaoyao and Mu Yiyang joined him, they stood out because of him, so he had to show his attitude.

He couldn’t let them pay the money if they lost after they helped him. It was impossible for him to do something like that!

“Sure, but I don’t think you have the chance to get the money. I think I can just wait for a fortune,” Mu Yiyang said. He didn’t think they would lose.

“Stop bragging! It’ll be humiliating if you lose,” said one of Qin Wentao’s friends.

“Don’t you want to win? Would you have a race if you knew you’re going to lose?” Mu Yiyang said frankly.

The man was struck dumb for a moment.

“Oh, car racing is very dangerous. If any accidents happen, one should take the responsibility on his own. I think we better sign an agreement before having the race. I don’t want anyone to deny it,” Qin Wentao suggested, as a touch of malice flashed in his eyes. Obviously, Qin Wentao decided to hurt Ling Tianqi during the game.

“We won’t deny it, but you should obey the rules,” said Pei Heran, looking at Qin Wentao with mockery. He was making it difficult for Qin Wentao, because Qin Wentao had done that last year.

Hearing that, Qin Wentao was displeased. He had indeed refused to do what they had agreed on last year, but he wouldn’t allow them to do that if he won. In fact, this time, he believed that he would win.

“Do you agree or not?” Qin Wentao got mad after being humiliated.

“Of course I agree.” Ling Tianqi answered. He didn’t think he would lose, so he didn’t want Qin Wentao to deny it.

If Qin Wentao refused to do what they had agreed on again, they wouldn’t lose with Leng Xiaoyao’s help. He was only afraid that it might cause trouble if they injured Qin Wentao.

Normally, people needed to sign an agreement when they wanted to have a race in the circuit. Therefore, they went to the office and printed the agreement.

During the time, Mu Yiyang called Li Mochen and said, “Hey, Leng Xiaoyao and I are going to have a race at the second track. Come and watch. It’s about to begin!”

Li Mochen and Si Yiqi were still in racing cars, but they immediately came over when they received Mu Yiyang’s call.

Li Mochen was surprised to see Leng Xiaoyao being with Mu Yiyang. Why were they together?

Did Mu Yiyang run into Leng Xiaoyao at the circuit, then decide to have a race?

Before long, the agreement was printed out. After reading it and making sure that there were no problems, they signed their names.

“Alright, the agreement is signed. Let’s go to pick our cars now,” Leng Xiaoyao said, then they went to pick cars.

Qin Wentao and his friends had arrived earlier, but they hadn’t picked cars yet, so they needed to continue to do that.

At the same time, they talked about what to do in the race later.

“I think they might try to hurt Brother Tianqi during the game. We must be careful. The rules say racers can’t deliberately knock against each other. If they do that first, we don’t need to care about their safety,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Sure,” Mu Yiyang agreed.

“Brother Tianqi, you can focus on getting to the end. You must be careful, but I’ll deal with the danger,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Thanks.” Ling Tianqi trusted Leng Xiaoyao, so he agreed.

After they finished, Li Mochen and Si Yiqi arrived.

Leng Xiaoyao heard Mu Yiyang call Li Mochen, so she wasn’t surprised when Li Mochen and Si Yiqi showed up. “Hi, Brother Mochen, Mr. Si.” She went to say hi to them.

Hearing the way Leng Xiaoyao called Li Mochen, Si Yiqi and Mu Yiyang were surprised. They subconsciously turned to look at Li Mochen and wondered when they became so familiar.

“Why did you call him Brother Mochen, while I’m Mr. Si?” asked Si Yiqi.

“Can’t I?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“Of course you can, but why didn’t you call me Brother Siqi?” asked Si Yiqi. He didn’t take it seriously, and was simply joking.

“Because I’m not familiar with you,” Leng Xiaoyao said. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“But you’re not familiar with him either!” Si Yiqi retorted.

“I’ve met him more times than I’ve met you,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Suddenly, Si Yiqi didn’t know what to say.

The race was about to begin, so Leng Xiaoyao stopped arguing with them and went to have the race.

Leng Xiaoyao and Mu Yiyang needed to protect Ling Tianqi, so they didn’t overtake him. In addition, they needed to stop their enemies from hurting Ling Tianqi so that he could have an open road to drive ahead.

After a few minutes, Ling Tianqi reached the front, followed by Leng Xiaoyao who blocked Qin Wentao who wanted to overtake Ling Tianqi.

Every time Qin Wentao wanted to overtake them, Leng Xiaoyao blocked his way. In his fury, Qin Wentao wanted to knock into her, but it would break the rules, so he had to calm down.

After all, it wasn’t difficult to find out whether a crash was an accident or a scheme.
