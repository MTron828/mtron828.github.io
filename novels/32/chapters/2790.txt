Chapter 2791: They Only Have Five Minutes

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After having lunch, they would go to meet the family that kept Leng Shaojia in Country Y.

The diplomatic ambassador had made an appointment for them, and the meeting would begin at 2 pm today.

This family was a second-rate family in Country Y, the Thomas family. Although it was a second-rate family, the Thomas family had a daughter who was married to the vice president, a daughter who was married to the heir of a first-class family, and a son who married the daughter of the richest family in the capital of Country Y.

Therefore, although the Thomas family was a second-rate family, its power was no less than that of a first-class family. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be so arrogant and deliberately go against the Leng family.

They kept Leng Shaojia in Country Y which was illegal, but they asked Leng Yuanqian to come and deal with it in person. That was reasonable, so the ambassador could do nothing about it.

Otherwise they would have solved the problem because of Leng Shaojia’s family background and wouldn’t have asked Leng Yuanqian to come in person.

Why did the Thomas family deliberately target the Leng family? It wasn’t just because Leng Shaojia accidentally injured the son of the Thomas family; the Thomas family must have colluded with a certain family in the Leng family’s country.

That was Gu Ning and the others’ guess, because they hadn’t had a result yet, but they thought it was highly likely for that to be the truth.

At 1 pm, they went to meet the Thomas family.

Along the way, Leng Yuanqian couldn’t calm down. In fact, except for Gu Ning and Si Jin, everyone was very nervous.

Before they came here, Gu Ning and the others had a discussion about the situation. No matter what happened, Si Jin’s job was to protect Leng Yuanqian, while Gu Ning would deal with other things.

Because it was obviously a scheme, the Thomas family would surely ask for something from Leng Yuanqian. If they didn’t accept it, the Thomas family could secretly injure them.

Gu Ning wasn’t afraid of that, because she could cure the injured, but if the Thomas family wouldn’t let them go safely, she wouldn’t hesitate to teach them a lesson.

The Thomas family had a very high status in Country Y, but they weren’t the most powerful. They were in the same situation as the Leng family. There were many ambitious families of influence competing against each other for power.

Therefore, if the Thomas family was in trouble, their opponents wouldn’t miss this great opportunity to make the situation worse.

They had a close relationship with the vice president, but forces supporting the president were waiting for them to have bad luck.

When Gu Ning and the others arrived at the Thomas family’s house, it was about ten minutes away from 2 pm. A guard at the gate reported their arrival.

The Thomas family was a very large family, and the mansion they lived in was really luxurious.

From the gate to the main house, there was a distance of fifty or sixty meters!

After the doorman called to the main house to pass the information, they were allowed to come in, but their cars couldn’t drive in, and their bodies had to be searched to prevent them from taking weapons in.

Actually, Gu Ning put all the necessary weapons in her telepathic eye space, so there was no need for them to carry weapons.

Even if there was any conflict, Gu Ning could take out a bunch of guns and explosives in an instant. She wouldn’t give in to threats. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Now that the technology was advanced, there was no need to search their bodies by hand. They just walked through the security check. If there was a weapon, it would set off an alarm, but none of them carried weapons, so they were taken straight to the main house after passing the security check.

Most of the members of the Thomas family were present, but they were all in the main house. Gu Ning and the others were guided to a 3-story building at the right of the main house. That was where the Thomas family treated their guests.

If there were any visitors, the Thomas family would see them there. If the guests needed to stay, they would stay in this building as well.

After all, the main house was too important so only their own family members or close friends could get in.

Gu Ning and the others attracted much attention along the way to the building.

Everyone knew who they were, because what the Thomas family had done wasn’t a secret.

When they were near the guest building, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to scan through it in case the Thomas family set anything dangerous inside.

There was nothing dangerous, but there were surveillance cameras everywhere.

In a guest room on the third floor, Leng Shaojia was locked inside, tied to the bed, with a lot of slap prints on her cheeks, and a lot of bruises around her body.

Although Gu Ning disliked Leng Shaojia, she was very angry when she saw Leng Shaojia being treated so badly.

It seemed it would be a tough negotiation this time.

Anyway, Leng Shaojia was still conscious, which meant she wasn’t seriously injured.

In the living room, a servant of the Thomas family invited them to have a seat, then he walked away. Gu Ning and the others were left in the living room.

“Will they keep us waiting for a long time to take us a notch down?” someone asked.

“I think it’s highly likely.” Replied someone else.

“We’ll just give them five minutes. If they don’t show up in five minutes, I’ll have a tour upstairs,” said Gu Ning. When she said that, she turned to deliberately watch the surveillance cameras at the corner.

She wasn’t sure whether the Thomas family were watching them right now, but she guessed they could hear her if they were.

If the Thomas family were watching them, the Thomas family must want to know what they were talking about. Therefore, the person who was watching them must know their language.

If they were still absent after five minutes, Gu Ning would go to get Leng Shaojia out first.

If they showed up within five minutes, she would wait for a while longer.

After all, it would cause unnecessary trouble if she went to take Leng Shaojia out right now, but she wouldn’t hesitate to teach them a lesson if they dared to try to take them down a notch.

Gu Ning was right. Someone was indeed watching them through the surveillance cameras, and the Thomas family had decided to keep them waiting for a few minutes, but when they heard Gu Ning’s words, they didn’t waste anymore time and immediately went over.

Leng Shaojia was upstairs so if Gu Ning went upstairs, she would easily find Leng Shaojia.

…

Leng Yuanqian and the others didn’t know that, but they understood what she wanted to do after looking in the same direction as her.
