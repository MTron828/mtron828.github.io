922 Miss Tang

“Miss, and this gentleman, please don’t mind what Policewoman Zhang just said. We still hope that you can assist us in the investigation,” Policeman Zhao said to Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting politely.

“Since you’re suspicious of us, we can assist you with the investigation, but I must tell you that we have nothing to do with this case. We’re leaving for City B at 8:50 am this morning. If we miss the flight because of the investigation, please pay us the compensation,” Gu Ning said.

She purposely said that to scare them because she hated being used.

Hearing that, Policeman Zhao and the others hesitated. It wasn’t up to them to pay the compensation.

“Miss, we’re also unwilling to cause any loss because of the investigation, but you’re involved in this case, so you have the duty to assist us,” Policeman Zhao said in a tough tone.

Leng Shaoting stopped remaining silent at this moment. He took out his Military Officer Certificate, and showed it to Policeman Zhao. “If you’re still suspicious of us, you must ask for permission from the military of our country before investigating me.”

Policeman Zhao and the others rounded their eyes in shock after seeing Leng Shaoting’s Military Officer Certificate.

What? A major general? Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He’s so young!

Since Leng Shaoting was a major general, they had no right to investigate him.

“How is it possible? You’re too young to be a major general!” Policewoman Zhang couldn’t believe her eyes.

“What? A major general?”

Onlookers were also shocked.

In ordinary people’s eyes, a major general was normally a man around 40 years old. Leng Shaoting, however, was in his twenties.

If he was a major general, he must have made many great achievements before. In that case, it was hard for others to believe that he would kill a girl. Soldiers were all upright, loyal people in their eyes.

Leng Shaoting took out his phone and made a call without delay.

Policeman Zhao didn’t dare to stop him, because he knew what Leng Shaoting was going to do. He was also sure that Leng Shaoting was really a major general.

Leng Shaoting briefly told the people on the phone what he had been through outside the Gonghao Hotel before he hung up. Within two minutes, Policeman Zhao’s phone rang, and the caller was the sergeant.

The sergeant ordered them to let Leng Shaoting go at once.

Policeman Zhao apologized to Leng Shaoting with great respect, “I’m so sorry, Major General Leng. Please feel free to leave.”

Hearing that, others all believed that this young man in front of them was really a major general in the army.

Policewoman Zhang didn’t dare to say a word now, but she still refused to believe that Leng Shaoting was already a major general at such an early age.

Leng Shaoting didn’t bother to waste time there, and soon left with Gu Ning.

The murderer might be involved in the Evil Practice, so Gu Ning didn’t provide the police with any clues. She knew that the police weren’t a match for the Evil Practice.

...

Luckily, Gu Ning and the others still had enough time to go to the airport.

Around two hours later, they arrived at City B.

Gu Ning had parked her car in the parking lot of the airport, so that they could drive it home when they got back.

When they were in the plane earlier, several stewardesses tried to strike up a conversation with Leng Shaoting, but Leng Shaoting only paid attention to Gu Ning so they gave up in the end.

It was time for lunch when they got back to City B, so they went to the Huangdeng Hotel afterwards.

Outside of the Huangdeng Hotel, many entertainment reporters were gathered together and two people were surrounded in the middle. One of the two people was a woman in her early thirties, while the other was wearing a baseball cap and large sunglasses to cover her face.

She must be a celebrity.

“Miss Tang, it’s said that the leading actress in Palace should be someone else, but you’ve replaced her all of a sudden. Is it because of your special relationship with Lord Cen?”

“Miss Tang, do you know that Lord Cen is already married?”

“Miss Tang...”

...

Hearing those entertainment reporters calling the woman Miss Tang, Gu Ning thought that they were calling her, but it turned out to be someone else. Miss Tang was the actress who was wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses.

Gu Ning held doubt towards their questions, because entertainment reporters loved making big scandals and fake news.

Anyway, the entertainment industry was the Vanity Fair, and it was true that many actresses would exchange sex for a role they wanted.

It was hard to tell which actress was innocent.

“Please stop asking those questions. There is no special or unusual relationship between Xiaoxiao and Lord Cen. It’s ridiculous that Xiaoxiao would destroy a man’s family,” Tang Xiaoxiao’s agent said that repeatedly, although she was furious now.

“There are photos of Miss Tang and Lord Cen dining alone in a restaurant on the Internet,” someone said.

“They were not dining alone, I was there too. We were talking about business. I left for the ladies’ room so I’m absent from those photos.” Tang Xiaoxiao’s agent explained, but nobody believed her.
