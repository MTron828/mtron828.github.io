Chapter 643 Play the Blame Game

“Well...” The waitress felt cornered. Seeing that Leng Shaojia was unwilling to retreat, she turned to Gu Ning and asked, “Miss, would you please wait for a few minutes?” In her eyes, Gu Ning was more considerate.

Gu Ning was indeed considerate most of the time, but she wouldn’t be friendly to those who were rude and domineering, so she asked the waitress, “I think it depends on the rules of your restaurant. First come, first served, or occupy the seats by violence?”

Hearing that, the waitress was struck dumb for a second. The restaurant, of course, served the diners in order of arrival, but the women who came here later seemed very aggressive. If they didn’t get the table, they could argue or even fight here, which would affect other diners.

However, this restaurant always obeyed the rule that the first customer was served first. If they broke the rule this time, it would damage the reputation of this restaurant, which would affect its business in the future. After thinking about it, the waitress decided to side with Gu Ning.

“Miss, please follow me,” she said to Gu Ning.

“Hey, what do you mean?” Leng Shaojia was mad and shouted in anger, “I booked the seat first, so why are you guiding her inside before me?”

Leng Shaojia was playing the blame game now. In fact, Leng Shaojia was so hot-tempered today because she was in a bad mood, otherwise she would tolerate it for the sake of the Leng family’s reputation.

Leng Shaojia’s angry shout attracted a lot of attention from other diners in the restaurant.

In a corner, Jiang Ruiqin was dining with Tang Qingyang. The dishes had just been served on the table, so they turned to look over. However, at first glance they didn’t see Leng Shaojia whose voice they were familiar with, but Gu Ning.

Seeing Gu Ning, Jiang Ruiqin’s eyes lit up at once and he walked towards her.

Tang Qingyang shook his head with a resigned look.

“What’s going on here.” The manager of the restaurant walked over after hearing the noise.

The waitress immediately reported to the manager on what just had happened. The manager seemed displeased after hearing it, and turned to look at the group of Leng Shaojia. “Miss, I’m sorry, but we always serve diners in order of arrival. If you still want to dine here, please wait for a while. If not, please go dine in another restaurant.”

“How dare you talk to us like that? Do you know who we are?” the woman stood by Leng Shaojia’s right side said arrogantly. “I was born in the Shi family.”

The Shi family was a famous super-rich family in the capital, and the manager was slightly scared.

Although Leng Shaojia was from a much more powerful family than her friends’, she seldom exposed her identity, unless it was necessary. Master Leng had warned them not to use the Leng family’s name to do bad things, or they would be punished according to their family’s principles.

Normally, the person would be locked in a small dark room for three days without anything to eat and just water to drink, which could cause a mental breakdown. Leng Shaojia had been punished once, and she didn’t want to suffer it again, so she would use her friends’ family background to bully others. Anyway, it was already enough.

“Miss Shi, do you think you have the right to grab seats away from others just because your family is super-rich?” At this moment, a male voice sounded and it attracted everyone’s attention.

Without looking at him, Gu Ning already knew who he was from his voice, so did Leng Shaojia. Gu Ning remained calm, while Leng Shaojia panicked a little.

“Jiang Ruiqin!” Shi Yanyan was surprised to meet Jiang Ruiqin here, and didn’t know what to do now. She gave Leng Shaojia a glance to ask for her opinion in silence. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Although there was an abyss between the Jiang family which was a common rich family, and the Shi family that was a super-rich family, the Jiang family had a close relationship with the Leng family after all. Most importantly, Leng Shaojia liked Jiang Ruiqin, and was unwilling to have conflict with him. However, Jiang Ruiqin disliked Leng Shaojia very much and kept a distance away from her.

Leng Shaojia was in a bad mood today because of Jiang Ruiqin. Just an hour ago, they met Jiang Ruiqin, and Leng Shaojia invited him to dine and watch a film together, but Jiang Ruiqin rejected her.

“Fine. We can leave the table to them, but we must share a table with you.” Leng Shaojia seized the chance to dine with Jiang Ruiqin.

Nevertheless, Jiang Ruiqin ignored Leng Shaojia, and looked to Gu Ning with sincerity. “Gu Ning, would you mind dining with us? I have always wanted to share a meal with you, so maybe today is my lucky day.”

“Jiang Ruiqin!” Leng Shaojia couldn’t believe her eyes. Why did Jiang Ruiqin invite this girl to dine with him? And they even seemed so close? What’s their relationship? Leng Shaojia thought to herself.

“Why not!” Gu Ning said.

Since they encountered each other, Gu Ning wouldn’t turn Jiang Ruiqin down. In addition, Gu Ning noticed that the arrogant woman liked Jiang Ruiqin, but Jiang Ruiqin disliked her. If so, Gu Ning was glad to see the arrogant woman being upset after Jiang Ruiqin invited her.

Jiang Ruiqin then ignored Leng Shaojia and guided Gu Ning to his table.

Leng Shaojia’s face was twisted in anger, and she lost her appetite, walking out at once. Her friends, of course, wouldn’t stay in the restaurant and left with her.

This restaurant was very popular and soon the last vacant table was occupied.

Although Leng Shaojia liked Jiang Ruiqin, she was too arrogant to tell him. In her eyes, the man she liked should feel honored and beg for her love, and she always believed that she was better than men. Even when she invited Jiang Ruiqin to dine together or watch a film together, she was still very arrogant and put it like she was doing him a favor.
