3246 Two Powerful People

“We found them together, so everyone has a share. I can take yours if you don’t want them, but Mu Yuan and Meng Fan must take theirs,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She could take Li Mochen’s share, but she wouldn’t take Mu Yuan and Meng Fan’s.

They were Li Mochen’s subordinates, but they were independent. Even if they served Li Mochen, they didn’t lack money.

“Miss Leng, we don’t need them. We agree with our boss!”

Mu Yuan and Meng Fan agreed at once. They weren’t displeased at all.

“You deserve it. You can’t always listen to him. Otherwise, you might lose a lot,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She said the last sentence to Li Mochen.

“Not at all, Miss Leng, our boss is very generous. We never lack money!”

“Right!”

Mu Yuan and Meng Fan immediately expressed their opinions. They weren’t afraid that Li Mochen would misunderstand them, they just didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to misunderstand Li Mochen.

Li Mochen agreed and said, “I can buy theirs and give them to you. I’ll pay them.”

Since Li Mochen insisted, while Mu Yuan and Meng Fan declined, Leng Xiaoyao said nothing else. “Fine!”

“I will take mine,” Mu Yiyang said. It was hard to buy some things even if he had money. His grandfather liked precious herbs, so he wanted to give them to his grandfather.

“Even if you wanted to give them to me, I wouldn’t take them. I won’t accept everyone’s gift,” Leng Xiaoyao said, then she gave a piece of ginseng and three reishi mushrooms to Mu Yiyang.

Hearing that, Li Mochen felt satisfied.

Mu Yiyang seemed hit. “You broke my heart. Aren’t we friends? Sometimes I can send you a gift or something.”

“What do you want to send her?” asked Li Mochen, squinting his eyes.

Although Li Mochen spoke in a flat tone, Mu Yiyang somehow felt as if he was in danger. He gave in instantly. “Um, Leng Xiaoyao just established a company. I need to send something to her at the opening ceremony. I can’t go there with empty hands, right?”

“Sure.” Li Mochen answered and said nothing else.

Because they needed to talk about something, they didn’t go back to their rooms and instead headed to the tea room.

There was a computer in the tea room, so Leng Xiaoyao immediately investigated Dai Ya and Lin Musi. At the same time, Mu Yiyang called his teammates to come to City Qin.

They just got back to the capital city, but Mu Yiyang wanted them to go to City Qin.

However, they weren’t displeased. After all, tasks were more important.

Without delay, Leng Xiaoyao collected information about Dai Ya and Lin Musi.

The Dai family was a kung fu family for a hundred years. Therefore, Dai Ya learned kung fu ever since she was little, so she was good at kung fu.

The Dai family owned martial arts gyms, martial arts schools, and security companies.

In addition to that, the Dai family was also involved in many other industries. They simply got rich through martial arts.

In the entertainment industry, many action stars learned in the Dai family’s martial art gyms. The Dai family also trained many martial arts directors and senior bodyguards.

Lin Musi was the daughter of the Lin family, a very rich family in City Hai.

Her father was the Lin family’s second son, but he passed away in a car accident when she was fifteen years old. Afterwards, her mother and she were always bullied by her two uncles.

Although Master Lin protected them, he was old and couldn’t do many things. Other family members could still cause Lin Musi and her mother trouble secretly.

Once Lin Musi was beaten by her cousin and her cousin’s friends, Dai Ya saw it and rescued her.

When Lin Musi saw that Dai Ya was so skilled, she wanted to learn kung fu too. She didn’t want her mother and her to be bullied again.

She accepted the tough process of learning the skills and finally became strong. Now none of the Lin family dared to bully them.

Knowing that, Leng Xiaoyao changed her impression of Lin Musi because they had been through the same thing. Lin Musi wasn’t so bad in her eyes. Moreover, she even felt sympathy for Lin Musi.

Anyway, Lin Musi didn’t have any conflicts with her, so she held no bias against Lin Musi.

“These two are powerful!” Leng Xiaoyao said. An idea dawned on her. Perhaps she could make friends with them. Thinking of that, she asked Li Mochen, “Brother Mochen, what if I make friends with them? What do you think?”

“Sure you can. The Dai family and the Xiao family have been very close for generations,” Li Mochen said.

In that case, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t need to worry about anything.

Anyway, it was up to whether they were destined to be friends. Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t do it on purpose. If they could meet again and become friends it would be for the best. If not, she wouldn’t bother to make it happen.

After that, Leng Xiaoyao started investigating the cave and those evil people as well as their support.

Unfortunately, she found nothing. After all, she wasn’t the only skilled hacker. As long as those evil people hid themselves well, it would be hard for her to find anything.

Besides, Li Mochen didn’t clearly take a video of their faces, so Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t find out who they were. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At 5:30 pm, they went out for a meal.

Coincidentally, they met Dai Ya and Lin Musi by chance in the elevator.

However, she knew that they were also staying in this hotel, so she wasn’t surprised.

On the contrary, Dai Ya and Lin Musi were surprised to see Leng Xiaoyao and the others. Dai Ya greeted them at once. “What a coincidence! Are you staying in this hotel as well?”

Leng Xiaoyao smiled. “Yeah, why don’t we eat together?”

The invitation wasn’t just a courtesy. Since Leng Xiaoyao had the intention of making friends with them, she obviously needed to invite them.

However, she wouldn’t deliberately do it or show too much interest.

It seemed that fate brought them together again. They met so quickly.

Dai Ya and Lin Musi were both surprised. Unexpectedly, Leng Xiaoyao invited them to have a meal.

They didn’t think that Leng Xiaoyao really meant it. It should just be a courtesy, so Dai Ya declined. “No need, we shouldn’t bother you.”

“Not at all, we went on an adventure together today. Can’t we be friends?” Leng Xiaoyao said with a smile.

“Of course!” Dai Ya was decisive. Since Leng Xiaoyao said that, she had no reason to turn her down.

Whether Leng Xiaoyao really wanted to make friends with her for had other purposes, she had to admit that Leng Xiaoyao and the others were powerful people. She was curious about them too, so she also wanted to form a close relationship with them.
