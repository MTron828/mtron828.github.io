Chapter 405 Lord Pan

Gu Ning hated frauds. And since she encountered one, she wouldn’t ignore it.

“Wait a second!” When the worker was about to cut the big raw material, Gu Ning stopped him. Everyone looked at her with confusion.

Gu Ning said to Mr. Zhang, “Mr. Zhang, I think that you better not buy this raw material.”

“Why?” Mr. Zhang didn’t understand.

However, before Gu Ning could say another word, the boss of this raw material shop, Mr. Yang, opened his mouth and his tone was unkind. “Miss, what do you mean?”

Gu Ning looked to him and said calmly, “I think that you know the reason. You better give the money back to Mr. Zhang, otherwise...” Gu Ning didn’t finish her sentence, but her sneer and meaningful tone revealed everything.

The boss of the raw material shop panicked a little. He wasn’t sure whether Gu Ning knew the truth, but he refused to admit it.

“He already paid for this raw material, and there is no reason to regret!” Mr. Yang pretended that he didn’t understand Gu Ning’s meaning.

“Oh, what if there is something wrong with this raw material?” Gu Ning sneered.

“What? This raw material isn’t right?” Everyone was surprised.

“Miss, are you serious?” Mr. Zhang asked anxiously. Although he wasn’t certain that Gu Ning spoke the truth, he had to be cautious now.

Mr. Yang, on the other hand, was struck dumb for a second, then he snapped at Gu Ning. “You have no proof!”

Mr. Yang was mad and panicking. How? How is it possible that this young girl found out that this raw material isn’t real?

Although he didn’t know how Gu Ning found out, it was obvious that she purposely told everyone in public.

Gu Ning stared at Mr. Yang and said, “I don’t have proof? Why don’t we make a bet then?”

“You...” Mr. Yang didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t bet with Gu Ning because he knew that it was an artificial raw material. Seeing that, most of the people started to believe Gu Ning.

“Is there something wrong with this raw material?”

“Mr. Yang, is this an artificial raw material?”

“Of course not!” Mr. Yang struggled, and said to his worker, “Drive her away! She’s crazy!”

“Wait a second, Mr. Yang. Since you’re confident, why do you refuse to bet? If this raw material is natural, I will pay you ten million yuan. However, if it’s artificial, you give the money back to Mr. Zhang. How about that?” Gu Ning said.

It sounded like it was to Mr. Yang’s advantage. However, only he knew that he was doomed to fail. If his dirty secret was exposed, the reputation of his shop would be ruined, and nobody would ever come to his shop again.

“Exactly! If you’re confident, why don’t you bet?”

“Indeed! If you win, you can have ten million yuan!”

Mr. Yang was so furious that he stared at Gu Ning evilly and questioned. “Why do I have to listen to you?”

“Of course you can reject, and then I’ll call the police,” Gu Ning said. She aimed to uncover his fraud, and she didn’t care about what would happen to Mr. Yang and his shop afterward.

“You...” Mr. Yang was speechless now and had no idea how to deal with it.

Right at this moment, a male voice sounded arrogantly. “Step aside! Let me see who dares cause trouble in a shop with the Pan family’s support!”

The minute people heard his voice; they instantly stepped aside and left a wide passage in the middle. A good-looking young man around 22-years-old strutted inside.

“Lord Pan! Since when has he been Mr. Yang’s support?”

“Well, I heard the person that Mr. Zhang annoyed is from the Pan family. I don’t know whether Lord Pan is Mr. Yang’s support, but I’m sure that he is coming here aiming at Mr. Zhang.”

“Gee, it seems Mr. Zhang is really in trouble!”

Although they discussed in a low voice, Gu Ning heard it clearly. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Lord Pan, of course, wasn’t Mr. Yang’s support, and he indeed came here to get revenge on Mr. Zhang. Seeing Lord Pan coming, Mr. Yang relaxed.

Gu Ning also sensed people’s fear of Lord Pan, but she wasn’t afraid of him at all. “It was me.”

Following Gu Ning’s voice, Lord Pan’s sight fell on her. He was surprised by her familiar face.

All of a sudden, he thought of something and became very excited. “Oh, it’s you! You’re the one who rescued the injured girl at the airport, right?” His abrupt change astonished everyone in the shop, but they all heard that Gu Ning was the one who had rescued the injured girl at the airport.

Gu Ning raised her eyebrow. She didn’t expect that this man recognized her face, but she wasn’t surprised because there had been so many cameras in front of her.

“Yes, it’s me.” Gu Ning didn’t deny it.

Having an affirmative answer, Lord Pan was more excited. “Do you know kung fu?”

“Sure,” Gu Ning replied.

“Um, can you teach me and be my master?” Lord Pan asked and looked at Gu Ning with anticipation.

People around them were stunned, and all doubted whether this Lord Pan was the high-profile one who was always arrogant. Lord Pan was famous for his disdain for women. Nobody could believe the scene.

Lord Pan loved fighting, and he naturally admired whoever was good at fighting. Although there were many martial clubs in City B, Lord Pan disliked them. And although it was easy for his family to find a master to teach him kung fu, he wasn’t willing to do so. He only did things according to his own will, and he was totally self-centered. The reason why he chose Gu Ning was because he had a good impression of her. Otherwise, he would never regard a girl as his master.

Lord Pan was arrogant, and always bullied others, but he had never committed crimes.
