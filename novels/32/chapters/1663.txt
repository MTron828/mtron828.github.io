“Even if I’m going to leave Fenghua Entertainment in the future, I’m its general manager now, so I have the power to manage my artists!” said Lu Xiao.

“Well, I know it’ll affect an artist’s development if her relationship is exposed, so I promise that I’ll keep it a secret after Yichu becomes my girl. Don’t worry, I’ll protect her well,” said Song Xiuyan.

“Bulls*it, Song Xiuyan! I’m warning you to stay away from Xia Yichu!” shouted Lu Xiao and hung up on Song Xiuyan.

He was indeed full of anger because of Xia Yichu. He now regretted helping Xia Yichu hire Song Xiuyan’s music teacher so that they had a chance to see each other.

Gu Ning didn’t rush to go inside and gave him several minutes to calm down.

Lu Xiao called Xia Yichu right after having the call with Song Xiuyan.

“Xia Yichu, stay away from Song Xiuyan. You’re still a new face, and gossip will only ruin your career. Do you understand?” said Lu Xiao. Although he was jealous, what he said was also the truth.

Xia Yichu only had a small number of fans, and not many of them were her loyal fans. Song Xiuyan, however, had dozens of millions of fans. And most of his fans were loyal. If Xia Yichu had any gossip with him, she would surely be amid strong criticisms.

Because Xia Yichu was still a new face, Song Xiuyan’s fans would jump to the conclusion that she wanted to ride on his coattails. However, if Xia Yichu was a popular successful singer too, the situation would be different.

Actually, even if Xia Yichu was popular too, Lu Xiao wouldn’t allow her to have any gossip.

“I told you I did keep a distance from him, but we have the same music teacher and I can’t avoid him forever,” said Xia Yichu, feeling aggrieved.

“Just stay away from him and leave the problems to me. I’ll handle it,” said Lu Xiao, but he was still mad at Song Xiuyan.

“Fine.” Xia Yichu agreed.

In fact, Xia Yichu could feel that Lu Xiao treated her differently, and he was a very handsome and successful mature man, so she had special feelings towards him too. Nevertheless, she felt that she didn’t deserve Lu Xiao, because Lu Xiao was at a much higher position than her.

Gu Ning knocked on the door of Lu Xiao’s office a minute after he finished the call with Xia Yichu.

“Come in,” said Lu Xiao in annoyance, because he was still in a bad mood.

Gu Ning then pushed the door open and walked inside.

Lu Xiao changed his expression the moment he saw Gu Ning. “Please have a seat, boss.”

Lu Xiao was Leng Shaoting’s man, but he didn’t know Yunyao, so he had no reaction when he saw her.

“Oh, I’ve already solved the problem Tang Xiaoxiao suffered,” said Lu Xiao.

A few days ago, Tang Xiaoxiao kept receiving strange messages and calls. Someone even stalked her to her home.

Tang Xiaoxiao was scared, but didn’t know who the person was. She told the company, who found out that the person was Tang Xiaoxiao’s fan, so they warned the fan not to do that again.

The fan remained quiet for only two days, before suddenly claiming that he wanted to kill himself on Weibo because Tang Xiaoxiao had betrayed him.

Internet users didn’t know the truth, and Tang Xiaoxiao became their target. Although Tang Xiaoxiao did nothing wrong, and it was purely slander, it still affected her reputation.

Even Gu Ning was amid criticisms too. However, Gu Ning’s loyal fans defended her as always.

Gu Ning didn’t care about it, but Tang Xiaoxiao was an actress so she had to clear her name. Therefore, Fenghua Entertainment posted evidence of the fan’s terrible behavior on Weibo to stop the rumor getting worse.

The fan actually had a mental problem, so he had many delusions. The hospital and his family could prove that.

Although some haters refused to believe it, most of the Internet users accepted the evidence.

“Glad to know that,” said Gu Ning. She believed in Lu Xiao’s ability.

Gu Ning said nothing about Xia Yichu, because it was their personal affair.

She also didn’t stay there for long, and soon left with Jing Yunyao. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

When they were home, Gu Ning told Jing Yunyao to have a rest and that she would cook, but Jing Yunyao refused so they cooked together in the end.
