Leng Shaoting heavily hit her mouth with a large piece of meat, and her teeth knocked against her lips, which was really painful.

“Alright, keep your voice low. If he hears you, he probably will do something else to hurt you again,” Jiang Shuyuan said.

Jiang Shuyuan was unwilling to annoy Leng Shaoting anymore. Although she was angry as well, she could do nothing about it. Leng Shaoting looked scary when he was mad.

To their astonishment, Leng Shaoting was willing to do anything to defend Gu Ning.

“Mom, I hate them. I hate them!” Leng Shaojia said.

“So? What can you do about it?” Jiang Shuyuan rolled her eyes.

Leng Shaojia was full of hatred now. It seemed that she had to make a decision right now.

“Mom, I need some sleep. Can you leave me alone?” Leng Shaojia pretended to be tired.

“Fine, have a good rest.” Jiang Shuyuan didn’t think further and left.

Leng Shaojia lay down on her bed afterwards.

Jiang Shuyuan suddenly thought of something when she was about to close the door of Leng Shaojia’s bedroom. “Oh, one of Gu Ning’s subordinates ranked 5th among the top 20 in the competition this time.”

“What?” Leng Shaojia sat up at once in shock. She knew that Yu Zi was the clothing designer of Charm and Charm was owned by Gu Ning.

If Yu Zi didn’t work for Gu Ning, Leng Shaojia wouldn’t mind it, but unfortunately she worked for Gu Ning.

She really hated the feeling when Gu Ning could alway do better and be more noticeable than her. She made up her mind to overshadow Gu Ning one day.

Jiang Shuyuan understood that Leng Shaojia would be in a terrible mood after hearing the news, but she couldn’t keep it a secret.

Once Jiang Shuyuan was gone, Leng Shaojia took out her other phone and dialed a number.

“Hi, Amy, have you made up your mind?” a foreigner said on the phone.

It was obvious that they had discussed it earlier on.

“Yeah, I’ll send her information to you later along with half of the remuneration. I don’t want her dead, just disfigured or disabled,” Leng Shaojia said with an evil expression.

Because of Gu Ning, she had tolerated a lot. She was a selfish person and blamed Gu Ning for everything, but she had actually caused Gu Ning trouble first.

Although Leng Shaojia was aware of Gu Ning’s real family background now, her hatred got the better of her and she lost her reason. The only thing she didn’t dare to do now was to directly kill Gu Ning.

She knew that it was illegal and she might be killed too if those who cared about Gu Ning found out what she did.

She had never killed someone before, and she was scared of murder. Even if Gu Ning was killed by someone she hired, she would still feel really anxious and have a guilty conscience, which was torture in her eyes.

Leng Shaoting wasn’t dumb, and it would be easy for him to find out if she couldn’t stay calm.

In fact, this wasn’t the first time she had contacted a foreigner. She had called him last time, but stopped her plan at the last second. However, she failed to control herself this time.

The foreigner was a professional killer from Country Y, and Leng Shaojia kept in touch with him under a fake name.

Smith helped her find this killer. Leng Shaojia only trusted Smith now.

Smith wasn’t a good man, so he didn’t think that it was wrong for Leng Shaojia to pay a killer to kill someone for her, and he had actually done the same thing before.

He knew someone in the Mafia of Country Y, so he gave Leng Shaojia a helping hand.

“No problem, Amy. Please wait for my information with patience,” the foreigner said. He didn’t tell Leng Shaojia when he could finish the task, because he needed some time to measure it. Once he made his judgment, he would set a price for it.

After hanging up the call, Leng Shaojia was still very nervous. It was crazy, but she felt excited as well. She believed that Gu Ning was doomed this time.

Without delay, Leng Shaojia sent a message to the foreigner.

Gu Ning, female, 19, born in City F, shows up often in City B and the capital.

Leng Shaojia didn’t know the address of Gu Ning’s home, so she only told the killer the locations of the stores of Charm, Jade Beauty Jewelry, and Kouzi.
