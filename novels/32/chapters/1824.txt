Chapter 1825: Final Warning

Chen Qiuyin felt that Gu Ning had destroyed it, so she didn’t change her opinion just because she was scared by Gu Ning. However, she was too scared to say a word now.

At this moment, three security guards of Fengshang Shopping Mall came over. Chen Qiuyin and Shen Zhilin breathed a sigh of relief.

“What are you doing! Let her go.” A security guard pointed at Gu Ning and scolded, then he was about to walk over and pull Gu Ning away.

Gu Ning refused to let Chen Qiuyin go, then drew a Black Card of Fengshang Shopping Mall from her pocket and showed it to the security guards.

The security guards recognized this card at once. Only those who had a close relationship with the Tang family could get a Black Card from Fengshang Shopping Mall! Therefore, those security guards stopped pulling Gu Ning away. Instead, they showed great respect towards her.

“Miss, can you tell us what has happened?”a security guard asked.

“This woman slandered me, humiliated me, and damaged my reputation in public. I just want to ask for an explanation. Don’t worry, I won’t do anything to hurt her or cause any trouble for Fengshang Shopping Mall. Please do me a little favor and leave it to me,” Gu Ning said.

The security guards hesitated, but agreed, and left immediately.

“Hey, come back, you guys!”

Chen Qiuyin and Shen Zhilin were anxious once they saw that the security guard had left.

“Oh my God! What is that? Why did the security guards agree to let her handle it?” someone asked with confusion.

“I don’t know! It seems that this girl isn’t ordinary. Perhaps she has a relationship with Fengshang Shopping Mall!”

“That seems to be the Black Card of Fengshang Shopping Mall. It seems that this girl’s background is really not simple!”

“What? The Black Card of Fengshang Shopping Mall?”

“...”

Gu Ning also didn’t care about the onlookers’ discussion. As long as it wasn’t something they shouldn’t talk about, she would ignore it.

Gu Ning then looked at Chen Qiuyin with a sneer, and said sarcastically, “Mrs. Shen, Miss Shen, it seems that you don’t respect the Leng family at all! You like to make your own decisions about everything.”

Did they think that they were relatives of the Leng family, so the Leng family wouldn’t do anything to them?

Quite the opposite, Gu Ning knew that the Leng family was about to punish the Shen family, because the Shen family was too greedy trying to ride on the Leng family’s coattails, or it would betray the Leng family.

Unfortunately, the Shen family didn’t have a stable position nor great advantages in the capital, so it wasn’t easy for them to climb up the social ladder. Even if it climbed up to a higher position by playing dirty tricks, it wouldn’t be stable.

Hearing that, Chen Qiuyin and Shen Zhilin both trembled, and they suddenly felt fear of the Leng family.

They focused on making things difficult for Gu Ning, and ignored the Leng family.

“No, we’re respectful of the Leng family,” Chen Qiuyin said with difficulty, suffering from her painful throat.

“No?” Gu Ning sneered, “Since you denied it, why did you still say that I tried to damage the relationship between Miss Shen and Shaoting? If so, you are also claiming that Shaoting is a playboy who has no sense of responsibility. The Leng family didn’t oppose or stop it, so the Leng family doesn’t have moral standards, right? Isn’t it enough to prove that you don’t respect the Leng family at all?”

Gu Ning’s words severely attacked Chen Qiuyin and Shen Zhilin. They were frightened and immediately explained. “No, no, no, we didn’t....”

They dared not think of Leng Shaoting and the Leng family like that. It was something that didn’t exist at all, and they made it up on their own.

When Song Miaoge heard Gu Ning talk about the Leng family, the first thing she thought of was the Leng family of the four major families in the capital. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Was it possible? She couldn’t believe it.

Although Gu Ning was very successful and outstanding, Song Miaoge thought it was impossible for her to have a relationship with such a powerful family, let alone the descendants of the Leng family.

It wasn’t that she looked down on Gu Ning, but after all, there was a huge gap between Gu Ning and the Leng family. To put it bluntly, there was no chance for them to get to know each other.

Although not all the people the Leng family knew were of high class, Song Miaoge still felt it was impossible. Maybe it was another Leng family.

When people talked about the Leng family, it normally referred to one of the four major families in the capital. However, in the capital, there were many other rich families with the surname Leng, but they didn’t know yet.

Ignoring their fears, Gu Ning continued, “You said that Miss Shen has a special relationship with Shaoting, but as far as I know, Miss Shen has only seen Shaoting a very few times! Even if they met, they seldom talked with each other. If you insist on saying that, why don’t we go to the Leng family’s house and ask Grandpa Leng, and Shaoting for the answer?”

Upon hearing that, Chen Qiuyin was shocked and shook her head.

“Don’t.” Shen Zhilin, who could speak, also blurted out subconsciously.

They absolutely couldn’t go to the Leng family’s house to talk about that, because things were exactly as Gu Ning said. Leng Shaoting and Shen Zhilin had only met one another a few times. Even if they met, Leng Shaoting was always indifferent to Shen Zhilin, so she seldom talked with him. At most, for the sake of seeing them as relatives, when they greeted him, he would give them a nod.

Seeing Chen Qiuyin and Shen Zhilin panicking, the truth couldn’t be more obvious.

Obviously, the mother and daughter were lying, so onlookers began to despise them.

“It turns out that they are lying! The woman admires a man and believes the man is hers. She even claims that the girl has damaged her relationship with the man. However, the woman seldom has chances to see and talk with the man.”

“Yeah, these two women are so shameless.”

“Right, they’re too shameless.”

“I feel that the man is also very innocent. According to their accounts, he becomes a bad man who has no sense of responsibility.”

“Exactly, this girl is obviously the man’s real girlfriend, but she’s slandered as the other woman. Her reputation has been damaged, but it’s only a lie.”

“...”

Everyone ridiculed them one after another. Those who had criticized Gu Ning just now felt embarrassed at this moment. They had scolded the wrong person.

“Mrs. Shen, Miss Shen, I will warn you for the last time. If you dare provoke me and slander me again, don’t blame me for talking directly to Grandpa Leng and Shaoting. What consequences will you endure at that time? It is your own responsibility.” Gu Ning coldly warned, then threw Chen Qiuyin away. Because Gu Ning used a lot of strength, Chen Qiuyin was directly thrown to the ground. She suffered a sharp pain, but couldn’t make a moan.

“You can let her go now!” Gu Ning looked at Baili Zongxue and said.

Baili Zongxue let go of Shen Zhilin at once, but she also pushed her straight towards Chen Qiuyin, then she fell on Chen Qiuyin.
