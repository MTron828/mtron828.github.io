Chapter 168 Leng Shaoting Stays up All Night

Gu Ning used her hairdryer to dry her waist-long hair and put it into a bun for convenience. She took her phone and keys, leaving for Gu Qing’s home afterwards.

Seeing that Jiang Xu was home, Gu Ning asked him with care, “Uncle, how is everything going?”

“Everything is fine. The construction materials will be delivered tomorrow afternoon. The store is ready to open the day after tomorrow!” Jiang Xu was apparently happy.

“I’m glad to hear that!” Gu Ning said.

Then she walked into the kitchen. Gu Man and Gu Qing were busy cooking. “Mom, aunt, do you need help?”

“Nope, just sit there. The meal will be ready soon,” Gu Qing said.

“Oh, how is the beauty salon?” Gu Ning asked.

“It’s going well. We’re getting used to running the business,” Gu Qing added.

“That’s good to know!” Gu Ning said. “Where is Xinyue?”

“In her room. She locked herself in the room after she came back from her school. I don’t know why. She won’t come out,” Gu Qing sounded a little worried.

“Let me talk to her,” Gu Ning said. She walked to Jiang Xinyue’s room and knocked on the door. “Xinyue, it’s me. What are you doing in there?”

“Nothing!” Jiang Xinyue said, but it seemed that she had no intention to come out. Gu Ning was astute enough to notice that pang Xinyue’s voice wasn’t right. She was crying, but why?

“May I come in?” Gu Ning asked.

“Sorry, I’m reading!” Jiang Xinyue declined.

“How can she be so impolite? Does she have to read right now? Xinyue, come out right now!” Gu Qing ran out from the kitchen and raised her voice in anger.

“Aunt, it’s fine. Leave it to me please!” Gu Ning immediately pushed Gu Qing back to the kitchen.

Although Gu Ning didn’t want to invade others’ privacy, Jiang Xinyue obviously wasn’t normal. Thus she could only use her Jade Eyes to see what was going on inside. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

In the room, w uxi a w o rld.site, Jiang Xinyue was actually sitting in front of her studying desk, but she wasn’t reading. She was crying. On her left cheek, there was a clear palm mark. To be specific, there were several palm marks added up.

Seeing that, Gu Ning’s face changed. She understood why Jiang Xinyue wasn’t willing to come out. She didn’t want anyone to find out about the injury on her face.

Gu Ning immediately went to get a bottle of icy drink and sent a message to Jiang Xinyue. Xinyue, I understand that you don’t want you parents to know what has happened, but I can help you. Please open the door and let me in.

Jiang Xinyue read the message and hesitated to open the door. After a few seconds, she stood up opening the door for Gu Ning.

Jiang Xinyue let her hair down to cover her left cheek. Gu Ning stood before her, but Jiang Xinyue only called her quietly and kept her head down to avoid her look.

Gu Ning walked in and closed the door at once. She locked the door before pulling Jiang Xinyue to the side of her bed. Without saying anything, she used the icy bottle to cover Jiang Xinyue’s swollen cheek. Jiang Xinyue moved unconsciously but was stopped by Gu Ning. “If you don’t want your parents to know, stay still.”

Jiang Xinyue didn’t dare to move afterward. She was a little afraid of Gu Ning since Gu Ning had changed into a different person.

Gu Ning used the icy bottle as a cover. In fact, she was secretly removing the red marks on Jiang Xinyue’s face with her power. However, in order not to raise any doubt, Gu Ning let the icy bottle stay on Jiang Xinyue’s face for several minutes.

“Sister, how did you know...” Jiang Xinyue didn’t realize it until now. How could Gu Ning know that her face was injured?

“It’s not important. Just tell me what happened!” Gu Ning of course wouldn’t tell Jiang Xinyue the truth.

Jiang Xinyue didn’t know where to start.

“Just say it.” Gu Ning threatened a little. Jiang Xinyue immediately opened her mouth. “A boy in our school likes me and sent me a letter, but I didn’t take it. Then a girl who likes the boy found out about it. She came to me and slapped my face several times. She even warned me to stay away from the boy, or she will hit me every time she sees me, but-but there is nothing between the boy and me!” Saying that Jiang Xinyue felt aggrieved and cried again.

Hearing that, Gu Ning was extremely annoyed.

“Which classroom does the girl study in? What is her name?” Gu Ning curbed her anger and asked coldly.

The third classroom in the ninth grade. They’re Xiapaojiao, Feng Xiaoyu and Zhang Yanlin.” Facing Gu Ning, Jiang Xinyue didn’t dare to hide the fact.

“Get it. I’ll fight back for you. And you must remember, don’t ever escape and cry alone anymore. You must stand up for yourself? Don’t be a coward. No one will respect a chicken. If you can’t handle it yourself, you can turn to me for help. Am I clear?” Gu Ning educated her cousin. She didn’t want her family to be bullied.

“Yes,” Jiang Xinyue answered. She also knew people always bullied the weak, but she was accustomed to staying quiet. It would take time for her to change.

Jiang Xinyue’s eyes were swollen after she had been crying for a long time, but Gu Ning’s magical power not only cured her eyes but also her cheek. When she came out with Gu Ning to eat, she looked no different than usual. Jiang Xinyue was

surprised, but she didn’t think further.

Gu Ning also told Jiang Xinyue to use the excuse that she didn’t do well in a test, so she was in a bad mood.

Gu Qing and others believed it and comforted Jiang Xinyue to try her best the next time.

They dined together in harmony later. At the same time, Leng Shaoting was still busy learning the ways of chasing a girl.

He had read many skills, like sending the girl flowers, seeing a movie together, sending the girl gifts, saying sweet nothings to her and so forth, but different girls liked different things, which confused Leng Shaoting a lot.

Therefore, he stayed up that entire night.

The next morning, when Gu Ning just walked out of zone G, she saw a black Land Rover stopped by the road, and Leng Shaoting was leaning against the car door facing her.

Gu Ning couldn’t deny that the man looked so cool and attractive in that pose.

Seeing Gu Ning, Leng Shaoting immediately stood straight. He was still a little nervous being with her. “Um, let me take you to school.”

Gu Ning calmed herself down. She felt slightly embarrassed that she was distracted by his charming appearance. “Oh, no, thanks. I always run to school.”

Leng Shaoting was a little upset. “Um, then I’ll run to your school with you.”
