3084 Take Is Cheap

After Song Meiyu and Leng Yuchen reached the third floor, they saw Leng Yuqi standing opposite Leng Xiaoyao. Leng Xiaoyao seemed to be mocking Leng Yuqi, while Leng Yuqi looked furious.

Besides, there was a red palm on Leng Yuqi’s cheek.

They had all heard the slap, and were aware that it was done by Leng Xiaoyao. They were furious and Song Meiyu rushed to question Leng Xiaoyao. “Leng Xiaoyao, why did you slap my daughter?”

“Because she humiliated me. She said I seduced Chu Jianan. She didn’t see us at all. Why did she say something like that? I dumped Chu Jianan. Not to mention that I feel disgusted whenever I see him,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t afraid at all to face Leng Yuqi’s family members. After all, she could easily beat them.

!!

“You…”

When Leng Xiaoyao humiliated Chu Jianan, Song Meiyu and the others were mad.

“If you won’t allow Leng Yuqi to humiliate you, why can you humiliate Jianan?” Leng Yuchen questioned.

“Because Chu Jianan betrayed me, he’s trash in my eyes. I’m telling the truth, but I’ve never hurt Leng Yuqi. I didn’t seduce Chu Jianan, so she can’t humiliate me,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Hearing that, they were struck dumb for a second, because Leng Xiaoyao was right. Chu Jianan had indeed betrayed her, so it was understandable that Leng Xiaoyao hated him, but Leng Xiaoyao had never hurt Leng Yuqi before. Instead, Leng Yuqi had hurt Leng Xiaoyao.

“And I can dress as I like. You have no right to judge me.” Leng Xiaoyao glared at Leng Yuqi, frightening her.

Leng Yuqi didn’t know what to say, because she knew she was wrong, but she was too angry to control herself just then.

Moreover, she was still unhappy that Leng Xiaoyao became beautiful. She wanted Leng Xiaoyao to be as ugly as always, so that she could be at ease.

Leng Yuqi didn’t know what to say, nor did Song Meiyu and Leng Yuchen.

Leng Xiaoyao ignored them afterwards, then opened the door and walked into her room.

“Yuqi…”

Song Meiyu and Leng Yuchen wanted to comfort Leng Yuqi, but Leng Yuqi was too sad to listen to them. She left them behind and shut them out of her room.

“Yuqi, open the door!” Song Meiyu knocked on the door at once. She knew Leng Yuqi was in a terrible mood now, so she wanted to comfort her.

“Mom, forget it. She’s sad right now. We should give her some room. Just let her be alone for a while.” Leng Yuchen stopped Song Meiyu. He knew that Leng Yuqi didn’t want to be bothered right now.

In fact, most people preferred to be quiet when they were in a bad mood. Only the others felt it was a good way to comfort them. Anyway, talk was cheap. When someone was in a bad mood, other people couldn’t feel the same thing.

One could only get rid of the bad mood by oneself.

“But Qiqi…” Song Meiyu was worried.

“I know you’re worried about her, but she needs time to be alone for a while now that she’s in a bad mood. You can come to see her after she feels better. I think Yuqi will be fine,” Leng Yuchen said impatiently. Although he understood Song Meiyu’s worries, he blamed her for not knowing what to do. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

If they went in at this time, Leng Yuqi would only feel more embarrassed.

Besides, he was also irritated now and needed to be quiet for a while too.

After all, Leng Xiaoyao’s complete change had shocked him.

Since Leng Yuchen said that, Song Meiyu didn’t insist and walked away.

Before she left, she glared at Leng Xiaoyao with deep hatred.

Leng Xiaoyao…

Back in her room, Leng Xiaoyao continued to hack into the surveillance cameras around the clubhouse she just visited to watch them.

At the same time, she didn’t forget to draw game characters.

…

In the living room, Leng Changyuan and the others knew that Song Meiyu and Leng Yuchen didn’t have a good result once they saw their expressions.

Only Leng Yehua had mixed emotions, while Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng were satisfied. They were like kids at this moment.

…

Leng Yuqi lay on the bed crying for a while, then decided to call Chu Jianan, but Chu Jianan didn’t answer her calls.

Because Chu Jianan didn’t reply to her messages and refused to answer her calls, she was becoming increasingly anxious. She couldn’t help thinking too much about it.

Did Chu Jianan really regret ending his engagement with Leng Xiaoyao?

…

An Chenjun and his friends didn’t separate until 12 am. After that, An Chenjun took Shen Xiyin back to his apartment.

When they got back to their apartment, Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t see what they were doing, so she stopped spying on them.

The next day, Leng Xiaoyao got up early in the morning, then went to run in the yard.

Seeing Leng Xiaoyao running, Leng Changyuan watched from the side. After she finished running, he asked, “Yaoyao, you have a lot of free time on Sunday. Why don’t you sleep some more?”

Although he knew it was Leng Xiaoyao’s habit to run early in the morning, she rarely had a chance to be free all day, so she could sleep a longer time. However, she didn’t do that. Instead, she got up early to run as usual.

“It’s my habit. I can’t sleep very long. I would rather get up early to run,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Alright, I don’t know what to do with you.” Leng Changyuan asked, “Will you go out for the whole day today?”

“Yeah, you guessed correctly. And I’ll bring you a gift when I’m back home.” Leng Xiaoyao grinned, but she wasn’t joking. She really wanted to send Leng Changyuan a gift.

In her memories, she had never given Leng Changyuan any gifts before. She was always asking him for gifts.

Now she felt lucky that she was back in this time space and made a lot of money. She felt it was necessary to send Leng Changyuan a gift.

“Oh, a gift?” Leng Changyuan was very surprised, because Leng Xiaoyao had never given him any gifts before, but Leng Changyuan didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to spend too much money, so he declined. “Great, I accepted your kindness, but I don’t think a gift is necessary. Why don’t you save your money to buy something you like.”

“Grandpa, please don’t upset me. I’m so disappointed.” Leng Xiaoyao pretended to be sad.

Leng Changyuan knew that she was acting, but didn’t have the heart to hurt her. “Alright, alright, I’ll accept your gift. Don’t be sad, Yaoyao.”

“That’s wonderful.” Leng Xiaoyao was happy. Her quick change annoyed and amused Leng Changyuan.
