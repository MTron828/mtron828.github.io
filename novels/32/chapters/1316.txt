Chapter 1317: Don’t Worry, I’m Fine.

Because Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting weren’t out for a long time, it was only 10 pm when they were back in the Tang family’s house and many people were still awake, while the Cao family already left.

Tang Jiakai called Gu Ning to have a talk in the backyard once she got home, and Gu Ning knew what he was going to ask her seeing his expression.

She knew that it had to be about today’s car accident. She was right.

“Ningning, I just heard of the terrible car accident. Are you sure that you’re fine?” Tang Jiakai asked. Although he saw Gu Ning with his own eyes now, he was still worried about her.

Gu Ning felt touched that Tang Jiakai cared about her. “Don’t worry, I’m fine.”

“Great.” Tang Jiakai nodded and felt relieved after hearing the answer from Gu Ning’s mouth. “Did you just go out to see the suspect? How is it now? Do you know who sent him?”

Tang Jiakai knew that it must have been an attempted murder, and he was quite angry about it. If he knew who the mastermind was, he would definitely pay the person back.

“Not yet, it’s under investigation,” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning wasn’t sure whether K could successfully find out about the foreign man’s background, because he was from another country. And even though K was a skilled hacker, there were still things he couldn’t do.

In fact, even if K couldn’t find out who the mastermind was, Gu Ning was still able to kill the foreign man without attracting any attention. It would be best if the foreign man was willing to tell her the name of the mastermind, but she couldn’t do anything about it if the foreign man refused to do so.

Tang Jiakai stopped asking about the accident, and they went back to the living room together.

...

Director Yao watched the video after Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting left. It was solid proof of the foreign man’s evil intentions. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Without delay, Director Yao arranged for someone to post the video along with an explanation to Weibo.

At this time, many people were off work and surfing on the Internet, so this post attracted a lot of attention within a short time.

In the beginning, only a few people were interested in it, but it went viral the second Gu Ning’s fans read it.

Countless Internet users began to repost it.

The video was enough to prove that the foreign man indeed had the intention to murder Gu Ning. He had spied on Gu Ning along the way from the airport to the overpass and even heavily hit her car in the end.

When there was no solid proof, almost 80% of Internet users already chose to side with Gu Ning and now they were even more determined to defend her. They @(mentioned) Gu Ning again and hoped that she would be fine.

This time, many Internet users also @(mentioned) Gu Ning’s companies and many influencers who often reposted Gu Ning’s posts on Weibo.

Not many haters showed up, and Gu Ning’s fans were still defending her on the Internet.

...

At 11 pm, the members of the Tang family went to sleep in their rooms.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting also went back to their own rooms. Because they were staying in the Tang family’s house tonight, it wasn’t appropriate for them to stay in the same room.

Right at this moment, Hao Ran read the news and called Gu Ning at once. Gu Ning told him that she was fine and comforted him for a while before he calmed down.

In order to not be bothered again by her friends, Gu Ning directly @(mentioned) all of them in their WeChat group and told them she was fine now.

The next day, Gu Ning got up at 6 am. Master Leng and Tang Haifeng were exercising in the yard.

They were old and light sleepers, so they always got up very early in the morning. In addition, Tang Haifeng was the Leng family’s guest, so it would be impolite if he got up too late.

Leng Yuanzhen and Yu Yin also got up before 7 am.

Tang Yunfan understood that their guests would get up early today, so they didn’t stay in bed for long either.

Breakfast was already prepared, so they soon gathered in the dining hall.

Leng Yuanzhen and Yu Yin only had two days off, so they had to go back to the capital after lunch.

Except for Tang Yunhang, the other members of the Tang family stayed home. However, because Tang Yunhang needed to deal with something important at work, he had to leave.

Gu Man and Jiang Lihua could be free all day, so there was no need for them to go to work.

...

Shortly after they finished breakfast, Gu Ning received a call from K.

“Hi, boss, I’ve found everything I could. The man’s name is Luca. He entered City B from Country Y in the night the day before yesterday, then stayed in XX hotel. About 9:40 am yesterday, he went to rent a big truck at XX road before he left for the airport, and what happened next is in the video I sent you yesterday. As for detailed information about Luca’s background, I’m afraid I can’t help,” K said and he was very honest.

“It’s fine.” Gu Ning didn’t feel disappointed.

Since K couldn’t help her with it, Gu Ning decided to turn to Leng Shaoting for help. If Leng Shaoting couldn’t do anything about it, she still had Tang Yunfan’s support. She knew that Tang Yunfan had some connections in Country Y.

Anyway, she wouldn’t give up right away.

“Shaoting, do you know anyone in Country Y who has the ability to get detailed information about a man?” Gu Ning asked Leng Shaoting later.

“Yeah, who do you want to know more about?” Leng Shaoting said.
