3342 Why Suddenly Talk About Me?

Leng Xiaoyao passed subject one easily, then subject two after trying once and receiving explanations from the coach.

The coach was shocked by how quickly Leng Xiaoyao passed subject three and four.

Although Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t the first to pass all subjects in one day, they had practiced many times at the driving school before.

However, this was Leng Xiaoyao’s first time practicing at the driving school, and she only tried once before passing.

After passing the test, Leng Xiaoyao quickly obtained the driver’s license.

“Mochen, I’ll treat you to dinner tonight. What do you want to eat?” Leng Xiaoyao was excited and wanted to invite Li Mochen to dinner.

“Why don’t we just cook at home?” Li Mochen suggested, feeling a bit nervous because he had his own idea.

If they went out, there would be too many people around. He wouldn’t have the opportunity to try. After returning home, he also didn’t know what reason to use to invite Leng Xiaoyao in. This kind of thing could only be tried when they were alone together.

Therefore, it was better to just go to Leng Xiaoyao’s house for dinner, then…

He knew that this “try” wasn’t very fair to Leng Xiaoyao, but before he was sure, he didn’t want to say it lightly. That would be too irresponsible.

“Okay, then you’ll have to take me to the supermarket.” Leng Xiaoyao agreed. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Li Mochen was more than happy to help.

The two of them went to the supermarket together, and anyone who looked at them would think that they were a couple.

“Hi, Brother Mochen!”

Suddenly, a woman’s voice called out Li Mochen’s name, but it wasn’t Leng Xiaoyao.

After hearing the voice, both Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochan instinctively looked over and saw a beautiful woman in her early twenties standing next to an older woman.

When the older woman saw Li Mochan, she was quite surprised.

However, when she saw Leng Xiaoyao, her eyes dimmed for a moment before quickly recovering. She then warmly said, “Mochen, it’s really you! When did you come back to the capital city? Why didn’t you come to see us?”

“Aunt Tao, nice to see you. I just came back recently and have been busy, so I didn’t have time to meet Tao Zheng.” Li Mochan replied.

Tao Zheng was Li Mochen’s friend, and they had a good relationship. Li Mochen had also visited the Tao family a few times.

“Since we met by chance today, it must be fate. Why don’t you come to our home for dinner tonight? My older brother is at home today.” Tao Yixiao sincerely invited Li Mochan, completely ignoring Leng Xiaoyao because she only wanted to invite Li Mochen.

She didn’t know who the girl with Li Mochen was, nor did she want to ask, but she was very curious and jealous in her heart.

This girl could be alone with Li Mochen, and even came to the supermarket together. Obviously, their relationship wasn’t common.

Moreover, this girl was so beautiful. It was impossible for her not to be jealous. She just concealed it.

“Thank you, but I have something else to do. I’ll catch up with Tao Zheng when I have time!” Li Mochen refused politely and distantly, because he was only familiar with Tao Zheng, not his family.

Even if he wasn’t familiar with them, he would treat his friend’s family politely, but if they had different intentions towards him, he wouldn’t want to get too close.

Something else to do? What could he have to do with another woman after coming to the supermarket!? Mrs. Tao and Tao Yixiao thought to themselves.

“May I know who this young lady is?” Mrs. Tao looked at Leng Xiaoyao and asked Li Mochen.

“She’s my friend,” Li Mochen said.

As soon as they heard that it was a friend, Mrs. Tao and Tao Yixiao were relieved. Since Li Mochen said it was a friend, then it was just a friend, not a girlfriend.

However, just because it wasn’t now doesn’t mean it wouldn’t be in the future, because Li Mochen had never had many women around him, yet today, he was alone with a woman in the supermarket, which showed that their relationship wasn’t as normal as friends.

As a result, Tao Yixiao still felt very threatened.

“I guess Brother Mochen is going to dine with this lady. So why don’t you two come to our house for dinner together! It’s more lively with more people!” Tao Yixiao said.

She didn’t invite Leng Xiaoyao earlier, but in order to invite Li Mochen, she had to invite Leng Xiaoyao as well.

“We still have important matters to discuss, so we can’t go. Please excuse us,” said Li Mochen. He didn’t want to waste any more time on them so he directly walked away.

Although Tao Yixiao was unwilling, she didn’t stop him.

After Li Mochen left, Tao Yixiao immediately became anxious and asked, “Mom, what should we do? Brother Mochen is with another woman now.”

“Since Mochen said she’s just a friend, then she probably is just a friend. You still have a chance. Go back and ask your older brother if he knows anything about Mochen and that woman. Knowing oneself and the enemy is the key to victory,” said Mrs. Tao. She really hoped that Tao Yixiao could be with Li Mochen.

Although Li Mochen was no longer the young master of the Li family, he wasn’t just handsome, he was also talented, so they didn’t care if he was still the young master or not.

…

“Oh, so it was your admirer! I think she isn’t bad! She’s pretty and has a good figure.” joked Leng Xiaoyao, but her tone was a bit ambiguous, although she didn’t realize it herself.

“Not as good as you,” Li Mochen said seriously and truthfully.

Leng Xiaoyao suddenly felt uneasy and said, “Why are you suddenly talking about me?”

“I’m just saying you’re better than her,” Li Mochen said earnestly. Actually, even if Tao Yixiao was really prettier than Leng Xiaoyao, he wouldn’t pay attention to her. He treated Leng Xiaoyao differently, not because of her appearance, but because of his feelings.

Leng Xiaoyao was in a panic. She didn’t want to dwell on this topic with Li Mochen any longer.

After returning home, it was almost time for dinner, so Leng Xiaoyao started cooking while Li Mochen helped.

Leng Xiaoyao originally refused, but she couldn’t resist Li Mochen’s insistence, so she had to compromise.

Being together made them both feel embarrassed.

Compared to Li Mochen, Leng Xiaoyao was even more confused about her feelings. She couldn’t help but despise herself for being so sentimental.

However, just as she regained her senses, she became absent-minded again.

As a result, she accidentally cut her hand while peeling potatoes, which startled herself and scared Li Mochen. He immediately put down what he was holding and grabbed her hand to see if she was okay.

“How can you be so careless!” Li Mochen’s heart ached for her.

“I…” Leng Xiaoyao raised her head, and her gaze met Li Muchen’s eyes. Her voice suddenly stopped as if something in Li Mochen’s eyes had attracted and stunned her. Her heart was beating faster as if it was about to jump out.

Li Mochen felt the same. He wasn’t deliberately looking at her like this because of the so-called experiment, but he was unconsciously attracted to her. He couldn’t help leaning towards Leng Xiaoyao and his lips covered hers…
