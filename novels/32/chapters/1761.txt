Chapter 1764: Have No Sense of Security

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning was so young, but she already learned the truth of life. They were going to graduate from university, but they knew nothing about it. They felt embarrassed.

“I’m a little talkative tonight. Please don’t mind it. If you disagree with me on what I just said, don’t take it seriously,” said Gu Ning. She was also afraid that they might think that she was judging them. She had indeed talked much about life, but didn’t force them to listen to her. Different people had different ideas after all.

“Goddess Gu, I think you’re right, and what you just said is also the truth. We’re too naive and only want to enjoy our current life. We have never thought about our future, and I’ve learned a lot from you,” said Cao Yang. He didn’t think what Gu Ning just said and did was wrong. On the contrary, he thought they were absolutely right, and he was clear-headed now.

“Right, we have never suffered any difficulties, so we don’t know how hard life could be. We only think about what we have right now,” said Cao Yang’s friend.

“My father has a friend who is a billionaire, but he passed away in a car accident. His son plays games all day and knows nothing about running a business. As a result, his company went bankrupt. His son is about 30 this year, but is still jobless. Luckily, he can make some money by playing games, or he might not be able to live,” said another of Cao Yang’s friends.

Actually, although Cao Yang’s friends loved hanging around, they already started to learn to take over their family businesses. As for the internship, they would work as interns in their own family companies.

He had also tried to persuade his friends to not hang around all day and to care more about the business, but they wouldn’t listen to him. He had to stop afterwards, in case they were annoyed and might not be able to be friends any longer.

They had mixed emotions after hearing what Gu Ning said.

At this time, dishes were placed on the table and interrupted the embarrassing atmosphere. They also changed the topic and the atmosphere became lively.

“Do you want to drink?” asked Cao Yang.

“Those who need to drive don’t drink, and those who won’t drive can enjoy yourself,” said Gu Ning.

“Well, then we don’t drink at all,” said Cao Yang. He was going to drive later, so he couldn’t drink. Even though his friends could drive him home, he thought it was boring if Gu Ning didn’t drink, so all of them chose not to drink.

After having night snacks, it was very late and they went back to their own home.

Before they separated, Cao Yang looked at Gu Ning. It seemed that he wanted to say something, but he closed his mouth. Gu Ning knew what he probably was going to say, but she said nothing since he didn’t say anything.

When they were in the parking lot, Cao Yang finally said, “Um, Goddess Gu, can we exchange our phone numbers? Please don’t get me wrong. I just really admire you and want to make friends with you.” Cao Yang didn’t want to be misunderstood, so he explained.

“Of course,” said Gu Ning. Since he asked for it, Gu Ning wouldn’t refuse, and she gave him her phone number.

Cao Yang was very excited when he had Gu Ning’s phone number. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When they were about to leave, Gu Ning asked Zhang Zikai whether she was afraid to go home alone. If she was afraid, they could send her home.

It wasn’t early, but there was still a lot of traffic on the road, so Zhang Zikai wasn’t afraid and declined.

Gu Ning drove Mu Ke to the hotel first, then brought Chu Peihan and Yu Mixi to Century City.

Because Leng Shaoting went to the military base, his phone was turned off and he didn’t call Gu Ning.

In the afternoon, Gu Ning called Jing Yunyao. There was nothing special, and she simply had a casual chat with her on the phone. Gu Ning told her to feel free to call her if she needed anything.

Jing Yunyao wasn’t a kid, so Gu Ning wasn’t worried about her staying alone in Mountain River Garden. Moreover, Jing Yunyao had stayed there for days and she was familiar with the place now. She was living alone now, and felt at ease.

After Tang Qingyang had the contract, he didn’t make it public right away. Instead, he decided to do that tomorrow. If there was nothing important or urgent, the information had to be released a day in advance to have a meeting of directors so that all the necessary members would be present.

Not every major shareholder came to the company every day. Normally, except for directors, shareholders only came sometimes or when it was necessary.

Tang Bingsen’s life was out of danger after he was given first aid right when he fainted that night, but he didn’t wake up until this afternoon. After he woke up, he seemed sluggish and remained silent all the time. When other people asked him what had happened, he said nothing and only chased them outside and stayed alone.

Ji Yijing learned the news that Tang Bingsen fainted at 9 am this morning, then she came to see him. She heard what had happened last night later, but Tang Bingsen refused to tell anyone what “Tang Aining” had done to him.

Once “Tang Aining” showed up, something terrible must have happened, or Tang Bingsen wouldn’t be like that now.

The existence of “Tang Aining” made Ji Yijing feel frightened, because she was too unbelievable and made the Tang family a mess. She didn’t know what “Tang Aining” would do in the future.

Tang Bingsen was sicker now, and she had no sense of security at all. She honestly didn’t know what to do next.

Ji Yijing stayed with Tang Bingsen till the afternoon, then went back to visit Tang Yaxin. Tang Bingsen and Tang Yaxin didn’t stay in the same hospital. Because Tang Bingsen was at home when he had the accident, he was sent to the nearest hospital.

Both Tang Bingsen and Tang Yaxin stayed in a VIP ward, so there was exclusive care for them. There was no need for Ji Yijing to take care of them and she only needed to see them in turn. Accordingly, Tang Bingsen didn’t move into the same hospital as Tang Yaxin.

Besides, they thought that Tang Bingsen’s condition wasn’t serious, but unfortunately he was getting worse and worse. It wasn’t convenient to move him right now.

Tang Yaxin’s brain was damaged and she was in a coma, so she couldn’t be moved casually at all.

As a result, neither of them could be moved and stayed in different hospitals.

...

The next morning, Gu Ning got up early to run, but didn’t see Baili Zongyang and his younger sister.

After running in the morning, Yu Mixi went to prepare breakfast.

After having breakfast, Gu Ning went to the company to work, while Chu Peihan and Yu Mixi enjoyed themselves as usual. There were still two days away from their enrollment, so they decided to make full use of the time.

As for the enrollment, they reached an agreement. In the morning of the first day, they would go to Mu Ke and Yu Mixi’s university, then go to Chu Peihan’s film academy in the afternoon. In the morning of the second day, they would go to Gu Ning’s university.
