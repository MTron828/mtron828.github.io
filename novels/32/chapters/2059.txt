Chapter 2061: Visit Tiandaozong

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Not at all. We can go right now.”

Shangguan Yang and the others just came, and they all put their stuff in Qiankun Bags or the telepathic eye space, so there was nothing they needed to pack up. Without hesitation, they stood up and left with Bai Lingtian.

“Senior Shangguan, I’ll go home now. See you tomorrow,” said Jing Jining. He brought Shangguan Yang and the others here, but it wasn’t appropriate for him to visit Tiandaozong along with them.

“Sure.” Shangguan Yang nodded.

When they walked out, there were still a lot of onlookers. Because they were curious to see whom Bai Lingtian was going to see, none of them left. However, they didn’t recognize the new faces that came out with Bai Lingtian. They only knew that those people must be very important.

After walking out, Bai Lingtian suddenly realized a problem, so he said with slight embarrassment, “I’m so sorry, Senior Shangguan. We came here in a hurry, so we didn’t prepare a carriage. I’m afraid we have to go there on our own.”

Although they were all cultivators who could fly with swords or qinggong and they didn’t need horses or carriages, Shangguan Yang was their guest, so it was a little impolite to tell Shangguan Yang to travel by himself.

“It’s fine. Leader Bai, please lead the way,” said Shangguan Yang airily. Afterwards, he waved his hand and a sword appeared in the air the next second. He stepped on it, followed by Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

Witnessing that, everyone except for Bai Lingtian and Xi Baichuan were surprised. It was a flying sword! He must be a senior cultivator!

Leng Shaoting could also fly with swords, but he was unwilling to show so many of his skills in public right now, so he took Shangguan Yang’s magical sword.

“Great,” said Bai Lingtian. He also waved his hand to show his sword, then he stepped on it with his two guards. Xi Baichuan and Ning Xu took out their own sword as well and stepped on it.

Bai Lingtian took the lead and quickly flew towards Tiandaozong. Within minutes, they arrived at its square.

At this moment, the square was ablaze with lights. All the disciples present already stood in lines, waiting. Only two elders who were on retreat and a head who wasn’t in Tiandaozong were absent.

There weren’t many disciples in Tiandaozong; there were slightly more than a hundred of them. Sects in the old times could have thousands of disciples. However, there were only about twenty thousand people in the cultivation world right now and only a few could become disciples of Tiandaozong. Moreover, not every qualified cultivator would choose to join Tiandaozong. Different people had different dreams after all.

Once Bai Lingtian and the others came, everyone turned to look at them. Seeing Shangguan Yang flying over with a sword, those who knew him weren’t surprised, while those who didn’t were all astonished.

Even if they were aware that they were going to welcome a very important figure with an enthusiastic reception, they were still amazed.

Gu Ning and the others didn’t know that Tiandaozong would prepare such a grand reception for them, showing that they really attached great importance to Shangguan Yang’s arrival.

Bai Lingtian and the others landed in the middle of the square, then walked to the hall. Two elders and two heads who stood outside immediately walked over to welcome them.

As they approached the hall, Gu Ning saw a familiar figure. It was Mo Qilin. She wasn’t surprised at all.

In front of the hall.

“Nice to see you, Senior Shangguan, I’m the second elder of Tiandaozong, Yun Hongqing.”

“Senior Shangguan, nice to see you, I’m the third elder of Tiandaozong, Shi Xiaoyang.”

Yun Hongqing and Shi Xiaoyang politely greeted Shangguan Yang. Because they were in the same generation, they could directly call each other’s titles. In addition, both of them had met Shangguan Yang before when they were young, so they could recognize Shangguan Yang.

Even if it happened hundreds of years ago, they still remembered their first meeting with Shangguan Yang, so they were sure that the senior cultivator was really him.

There were people who resembled each other, but it was rare to see two people who so closely resembled one another.

Moreover, even if the senior cultivator wasn’t Shangguan Yang, they would still be very polite to him given his unusually high level.

Shangguan Yang also remembered that they had met before, but he simply didn’t know their names. After all, they didn’t talk to each other back then.

“Senior Shangguan, honored to see you, I’m Wei Xian, the head of the Chasing-cloud Department of Tiandaozong.”

“Senior Shangguan, honored to see you, I’m the head of the Gale Hall of Tiandaozong.”

The Gale Hall was the information department of Tiandaozong.

“Nice to see you all. Thank you so much for your invitation,” said Shangguan Yang nicely. Even though his level was higher than theirs and he enjoyed a higher status than them as well, he was the guest after all, so he naturally should thank the host. Moreover, he was politely welcomed by the host, so he was willing to be a polite guest.

“It’s our honor that Senior Shangguan is willing to come to Tiandaozong,” said the third elder.

“Right.” The fourth elder chimed in.

“Nice to see you, Elder Yun, Elder Shi, Head Wei, and Head Fu.” Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting greeted them.

“Nice to see you too, young friends.”

They didn’t take Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting lightly just because they were juniors. Because of Shangguan Yang, they replied to them politely.

In fact, when they saw Leng Shaoting they were surprised by his level. At his young age, he already reached the Golden Core Stage, which proved that he was talented! Anyway, he was Shangguan Yang’s disciple, so it was very normal.

After that, Leader Bai turned to look at the disciples at the square and said loudly, “Everyone, this is the elder of the Kunlun Sect, Senior Shangguan.”

Hearing that, all the disciples at the square made a bow towards Shangguan Yang with hands folded in front and respectfully said, “Honored to see you, Senior Shangguan.”

Shangguan Yang didn’t need to reply to them. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

After the reception, the two elders and Bai Lingtian brought them to have a chat in the living room.

Within seconds, the news that Bai Lingtian personally went to welcome a senior cultivator at a hotel spread abroad to the four major families.

Shortly after Jing Jining was taken away by people of Tiandaozong, they learned the news and they also believed that it must have something to do with Yin Shixun’s death that Tiandaozong took Jing Jining away.

They went to learn more details about the news and found out that Jing Jining had two senior cultivators by his side, so everyone understood that Tiandaozong might have a suspicion that the two senior cultivators had helped Jing Jining kill Yin Shixun.

Therefore, they sent people to check the situation in the hotel and saw Jing Jining come back with Bai Lingtian. After that, the senior cultivators who showed up with Jing Jining were invited to Tiandaozong.

Except for the Jing family, they didn’t know why. Because Jing Yanhua was a member of the Jing family, Jing Yaorong ordered someone to tell him to see him once he got home.. He also called Jing Yanhua over to hear about the case.
