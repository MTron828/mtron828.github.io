Chapter 1151 Avenge

Therefore, they stopped for a while and watched the fight for a few minutes before they drove away, which wasn’t a bad thing for Gu Ning.When Gu Ning was fighting against the man, Situ Ye already booked a room at a restaurant and called her, but Gu Ning put her phone into the telepathic eye space, so Situ Ye failed to get through to her. After that, Situ Ye sent a message and told her the address.

As time went by, the man ran out of energy.

Gu Ning, however, used her magical power to help her become energetic again. Because of this, the man soon lost the fight.

Although he was a killer and was mentally-prepared to be killed at any moment, it didn’t mean that he wasn’t afraid of death.

When he realized that it was impossible for him to kill Gao Yi and Qiao Ya right now, he wanted to escape. However, Gu Ning didn’t give him any chances. Within the next minute, Gu Ning directly beat him up till he had no strength to struggle.

He was completely shocked by Gu Ning’s power. After all, he was a top killer and ranked 7th in the killers’ world!

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya were also impressed by Gu Ning’s fighting skills and strength.

“Tell me, why do you stalk us? Who told you to do that?” Gu Ning questioned the man in anger.

The man was frightened. He felt like he wasn’t facing a young girl, but the most powerful woman in this world.

Although Gu Ning was aware that the man simply aimed to kill Gao Yi and Qiao Ya, she needed to find out more details.

The man was scared by Gu Ning’s anger, but refused to say a word.

“What? You would rather die than say a word?” Gu Ning squinted at him.

“Can you let me go if I tell you?” the man asked. He was worried that Gu Ning might kill him.

“Sure, I can let you go if you tell me,” Gu Ning said. She agreed not to kill him, but it didn’t mean that she wouldn’t injure him.

Actually, if this man was injured or disabled, he would be vulnerable and would be easily abandoned or killed by the killer organization he had joined. There was no need for Gu Ning to kill him with her own hands.

“Do you think I’ll trust you?” the man said. He was tired of this trick.

“I don’t care whether you trust me or not, because I already know the answer,” Gu Ning said. “Did the leader of the killer organization they used to work for send you here?”

Nevertheless, a touch of disdain flashed by the man’s eyes when Gu Ning said that.

Gu Ning didn’t miss it, and cocked her eyebrow. It clearly wasn’t right.

Another idea dawned on Gu Ning.

She thought that the man might have been hired by the relatives of the people Gao Yi and Qiao Ya had killed before. It was possible that the man came here to avenge their death.

Thinking that, Gu Ning asked, “Were you hired by the relatives of the people they killed before to avenge their death?”

This time, the man panicked a little, but he soon composed himself, however, Gu Ning still caught his reaction.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya noticed it too.

Both of them were surprised when the answer came out, because they also thought that this man was hired by the killer organization they had worked for.

When they saw the man’s reaction, they realized that he might have been hired by someone who hated them with a passion.

Although normally Gao Yi and Qiao Ya killed bad people, it was undeniable that even bad people all had a family and relatives. Seeing as they had killed them, their families or relatives would obviously hate them.

In the killers’ world, there was an Intranet with all kinds of killing tasks on it, and killers could take on tasks as they wanted.

Qiao Ya and Gao Yi weren’t completely cold-blooded or ruthless, so they preferred to kill bad people when they took tasks.

Killers who wanted to see the tasks needed to gain permission from the manager of the Intranet.

Previously, when K wanted to hack this Intranet, he had to use Gao Yi’s account to log in first. Without an approved account, it was impossible for anyone to get access to it. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

K was a very famous international hacker, but he wasn’t the best. There were many hackers who were better than him in the world.

All kinds of killer organizations were quite mysterious, so only the top hackers were able to manage the website. Therefore, once K logged into the website, he was found and followed.

Luckily, K realized it quickly, and logged out to stop the hacker from following him.

After K removed Gao Yi, Qiao Ya, and Ba Tianyang’s names from the wanted list on the website, he figured out a way to prevent other people from putting their names on it again. In addition, K developed a virus. If anyone put Gao Yi’s, Qiao Ya’s, or Ba Tianyang’s name back on the list, the website would be attacked by the virus.

In order to not damage the whole system, the manager of the website gave up. However, the manager was also mad at the fact that another hacker could remove killers’ names from the wanted list as he wanted.

In normal cases, no one would know which killer had killed the targets advertised on the website.
