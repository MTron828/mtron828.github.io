Chapter 2865: Catch Us if You Can!

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

They went to where those miners dug the raw jade materials, then filled their sacks.

Right as they were about to leave carrying sacks, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting showed up and blocked their way.

Although Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s sudden appearance scared the two men, they weren’t afraid. They didn’t feel it was too dangerous, even though they could see that Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting weren’t weak.

However, the monster sensed great danger.

“Oh, you’re the thieves who have stolen a lot of raw jade materials from us, right? I finally caught you! How dare you steal my stuff? Do you want to be put in jail?” Gu Ning coldly stared at them as she spoke angrily.

“So what? Catch us if you can!” shouted one of the men. He didn’t take Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting seriously at all. Even if they were good at fighting, he didn’t think that he was weak. And there were three of them, especially the monster who was unusually strong.

The two men had no idea that the third man was a monster.

Unfortunately, they were no match for Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting making it impossible for them to run away.

Therefore, while the two men were provoking Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting, the monster dumped the sack of raw jade materials and tried to escape.

Seeing that, the two men were struck dumb for a second. The third man was much stronger than them, yet he wanted to run away!

It confused them, but Leng Shaoting quickly stopped the third man even before they came back to their senses.

How could he be so fast?

“Please, let me go. I can return all the stolen raw jade materials to you!” The monster begged at once. Because Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were too strong, he couldn’t fight them. It wasn’t easy for it to achieve a human shape, so it would be a great loss if it went back to being a monster.

The two men were astonished by his words. Although Leng Shaoting seemed strong, they didn’t think the third man should be so scared.

Besides, they hadn’t fought yet. It was too early to know who would win. Why did the third man give up right away?

Thinking of that, the two men disdained the third man.

And the third man even said that he would return the stolen raw jade materials.

The two men strongly disagreed. “Zhou Jin, you’re a coward.”

“Fine, you’re not cowards. You can deal with it by yourselves, but I suggest that you don’t fight back,” Zhou Jin, who was the monster, tried to persuade them to give up as well.

Although he was a monster, they had been together for a long time and he saw them as his friends. If it was possible, he was willing to help them.

Actually, he only tried to run away and leave them behind because Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were too strong.

“You…” The two men were mad and still believed that Zhou Jin was a coward. “Don’t embarrass us in front of other people. You haven’t even fought yet. Why do you think we’ll lose?”

“He’s right. If you give up right now, we can let you go, but if you dare to fight back, we’ll teach you a lesson.” Gu Ning sneered.

“No way!” The two men were unwilling to yield.

“If so, I’m afraid that I will have to resort to violence,” Gu Ning said, then directly attacked them as they immediately fought back.

They were good at fighting, but they were no match for Gu Ning, so they were at a disadvantage as soon as they started fighting against Gu Ning.

They were shocked to know that Gu Ning was a lot better than them.

Zhou Jin again tried to run away while they were fighting, but Leng Shaoting stopped him again and attacked him.

Although Zhou Jin was much stronger than the two men and had special skills, he was still hardly comparable to Leng Shaoting who was at a high level.

Gu Ning didn’t use her magical power in the fight, so she needed some time to beat the two men. However, within a few minutes, the two men failed and were injured, but their lives weren’t in danger.

Leng Shaoting controlled Zhou Jin, who was also badly injured, within a minute.

Zhou Jin wasn’t surprised by the result, but the two men couldn’t accept it.

They were surprised that Gu Ning could beat them so easily and that Leng Shaoting caught Zhou Jin so quickly. After all, Zhou Jin was much stronger than them.

However, that also proved how strong Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were.

“How about now? Do you realize how strong we are now?” Gu Ning looked down her nose at them.

“What do you want?” one man asked angrily. He had to admit that Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were stronger than them, but they cared more about their condition now.

“Return what you’ve stolen and pay three times the price as compensation, or you can directly pay me a hundred million yuan, then you can go. If you don’t agree, I’ll hand you over to the police,” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning didn’t take them to the police station right away because there was a monster among them and it would cause unnecessary trouble if it went with them.

Even if they were sent to the police station, no one would pay her for her loss.

Gu Ning didn’t care how long they would be sentenced to prison, she preferred to get paid for her loss. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What? Three times the prices? A hundred million yuan?”

The two men rounded their eyes in shock. Was this girl crazy? They only sold the jade they had stolen for about thirty million yuan, but now she wanted three times the money or a hundred million yuan!

“That’s too much! There was no jade in the raw jade materials that we stole,” one of the men said at once. Anyway, they wouldn’t know whether there was jade in the stolen raw jade materials.

“No jade in them? Do you think that I’d believe you? I heard your conversation earlier. And you said that there was jade in the raw jade materials you’ve stolen every time,” Gu Ning argued. If she hadn’t heard their conversation, she might have believed their words to some extent.
