Chapter 546 Do You Feel Nothing for Him?

“What? You’re not going to attend your classes, and you’ll directly attend the entrance examination to college? Are you sure that you can pass it?” Cao Wenxin rounded her eyes in shock. She didn’t expect that Gu Ning would be so bold. “Will your principal agree? Will you be expelled?”

“Don’t worry. As long as I can pass the exam and get a good score nobody will stop me.” Gu Ning was confident that her principal would agree because she was the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry after all. Skilled people were not only those who were good at studying, but also those who could do business well. Therefore, it was impossible that her principal would expel her, who became a billionaire at such a young age.

“Fine, you win.” Seeing Gu Ning being so confident, Cao Wenxin chose to believe her. After all, Gu Ning was very outstanding.

All of a sudden, Cao Wenxin seemed upset, so Gu Ning asked her, “What’s wrong?”

“It’s all because of Xin Bei! When I first met him, I mistook him as a terrible man because I thought that Yu Wenjing was his girlfriend, and I even helped Yu Wenjing. However, I met Yu Wenjing in a shopping mall today and she swore at me when she saw me! She’s so insane, and said that I have a secret romantic relationship with Xin Bei. How is it possible? Xin Bei and I hate each other so much, and we’ll never be close to one another,” Cao Wenxin told Gu Ning everything, like she couldn’t tolerate it anymore.

Hearing that, Gu Ning was surprised. “Well, is it true? Are you secretly dating Xin Bei?”

“Of course not! How is it possible!” Cao Wenxin denied it at once. “Her friend just saw me hanging out with Xin Bei at the Lantern Festival so she believes that I’m dating Xin Bei, but we hung out together with our families. We didn’t hang out alone.” Cao Wenxin felt aggrieved

Gu Ning, on the other hand, was greatly surprised. “How come you hung out with Xin Bei at the Lantern Festival?” Gu Ning asked.

Cao Wenxin said, “Didn’t Xin Bei tell us that he was going to visit his uncle when we met him at the airport last time? Can you believe that his uncle is my uncle too! When we spent the Lantern Festival together, my aunt and my mom even wanted to set us up!”

Gu Ning thought for a while. In the beginning, she believed that Cao Wenxin and Xu Jinchen would be a great couple, but it seemed that Cao Wenxin and Xin Bei were more suitable for each other. Although they disliked each other now, it was possible that they had a love-hate relationship. In addition, Tang Yunrong approved of Xin Bei.

“Do you feel nothing for him? Gu Ning asked.

Hearing that, Cao Wenxin panicked a little, then denied at once. “Yes, I feel nothing.”

Gu Ning smiled, but didn’t say another word because she knew that Cao Wenxin was lying. She decided to do something when it was needed to help them.

When it was almost 9 pm, Cao Wenxin went back to her house. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Gu Ning then called her principal. “Hi, I’m so sorry to bother you, sir. This is Gu Ning.”

“Gu Ning?” The principal was surprised to hear from Gu Ning. “May I help?”

“Well, the thing is I’m very busy recently in City B and I’ll be absent from classes a lot, so can I not go to school until the entrance examination to college comes? Please don’t worry. I promise that I will keep studying on my own, and pass the exam with a great test score,” Gu Ning said. Gu Ning was confident that she could easily pass all kinds of exams.

“Sure, no problem!” the principal said with alacrity. “I’ll talk to your headteacher tomorrow, and we’ll inform you three days before the entrance examination to college.” It went more smoothly than Gu Ning had thought.

“Thank you so much!” Gu Ning said.

“My pleasure. Gu Ning, you’re the pride of our school, and other principals from other school are all jealous of me after they heard about your successful business!” the principal said with happiness.

Gu Ning suddenly thought of something, then said, “Sir, if you don’t mind, I’d love to donate five million yuan for redecoration or reconstruction of our school.”

Although the No.3 High School was just a common high school and many buildings were aging, the principal had applied for money to reconstruct and redecorate them. However, his application had been rejected. Since Gu Ning was rich now, she was willing to do something for her alma mater.

“R-really?” The principal was shocked, and couldn’t believe his ears.

“Of course. I’ll send someone to settle it with you tomorrow,” Gu Ning said with a smile.

“Will your parents agree?” the principal asked worriedly. He knew that Gu Ning had made a lot of money, but she was just a student after all.

“My parents are supportive,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, the principal relaxed.

“That’ll be great!” The principal was very excited and grateful. “Thank you so much, Gu Ning!”

“My pleasure,” Gu Ning said.

After hanging up the call with Gu Ning, the principal wiped his tears away. His wife, Bai Nianlan, noticed and asked with confusion, “What happened?”

The principal sighed, “Didn’t I tell you that my application for some money to reconstruct and redecorate the aged buildings in the school has been rejected?”
