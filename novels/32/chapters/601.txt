Chapter 603 Desirable Gu Ning

Shen Ruiyin’s fans were quiet now because Shen Ruiyin came out to clear Su Tongnuo’s name.

After this drama, the amount of Su Tongnuo’s followers on Weibo increased rapidly.

Half an hour later, Gu Ning told Su Tongnuo to send out a new post.

Su Tongnuo: I’m so honored to be the spokesperson of @Jade Beauty Jewelry! We had the shoot in the photo studio of Tanghuang Entertainment, but unexpectedly caused a misunderstanding. Glad to know my name is cleared now. Love these pieces of jade jewelry so much! (Pictures Attached]

Su Tongnuo uploaded six selfies to show the six sets of jade jewelry. Although the design of the jade jewelry wasn’t very special, the jewelry still looked extremely attractive because it was made of high-level jade.

Once the post was out, many people reposted it within minutes along with compliments.

“Wow, Tongnuo is so beautiful, so is the jewelry!”

“Is the brand Jade Beauty Jewelry?”

“The brand is very famous recently, and it became a hot topic just now! Tongnuo, do you know Goddess Gu? Can you post some photos of her?”

“Photos of Goddess Gu Please!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Please!”

Actually, Su Tongnuo should be the focus of the advertisement, but Gu Ning replaced her once Jade Beauty Jewelry appeared.

After that, Jade Beauty Jewelry and Gu Ning gained a lot of attention again.

As long as Jade Beauty Jewelry, Su Tongnuo and Gu Ning became more popular, more people became potential customers of Jade Beauty Jewelry.

Although some thought that it must be a publicity stunt by Jade Beauty Jewelry, it became popular anyway.

Because Gu Ning didn’t have a Weibo account, many people went to follow Su Tongnuo and Jade Beauty Jewelry. Within hours, Su Tongnuo already had over ten million followers on Weibo. Some of them were in fact Gu Ning’s fans, and they followed Su Tongnuo’s Weibo for information on Gu Ning, but it didn’t affect the fact that they were also Su Tongnuo’s fans now.

Li Yuanmin, at the same time, almost went crazy because he had to reply to dozens of thousands of comments.

Shen Ruiyin, however, was in a rage, because Su Tongnuo was even more famous than her now.

“Boss, you’ve stolen my thunder,” Reading fans’ comments, Su Tongnuo complained to Gu Ning. Of course, she was just joking. If Gu Ning was an actress, she would probably be jealous, but Gu Ning was her boss.

Gu Ning flipped her hair showing her allure. “Well, I’m too charming to be ignored.” Of course, Gu Ning was kidding too, but she did stun everyone around the table.

If Gu Ning stayed cold and serious, nobody thought that she could actually be so sexy.

Su Tongnuo took a long breath before she said half seriously, “Boss, I think you better be cold and serious or cute, but not sexy, because you’ll become every woman’s enemy.”

She was right. Gu Ning was very outstanding, and women easily got jealous of her.

When Gu Ning grew older and became a mature, stunning woman, she would be every man’s dream lover.

“I’m not afraid at all!” Gu Ning said. Gu Ning really didn’t care about that.

“Boss, do you want me to post some photos of you?” Su Tongnuo asked.

“No. I’m not a star after all and I have no intention to be the focus of public attention,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure.” Since Gu Ning was unwilling to do so, Su Tongnuo of course wouldn’t insist.

When it was 5:30 pm, they finished shooting.

Gu Ning told Fei Nan to send her the original photos and she planned to let K to retouch them for posters. As for the video advertisement, the director of Tanghuang Entertainment would film it, and K would edit it too.

Gu Ning did that not because she didn’t trust the professionals in Tanghuang Entertainment, but because she preferred to use her own people. Tanghuang Entertainment didn’t provide free services because Gu Ning insisted on paying them.

After a while, a group of them left the photo studio.

“Look, is she Su Tongnuo?”

The moment they walked out, some staff in Tanghuang Entertainment noticed them, but Su Tongnuo was wearing a baseball cap and a mask, so they weren’t sure of it.

“It seems so! I need to take pictures of her.” Saying that, a girl took many pictures of them, but she didn’t walk near, because it was work time and she was afraid that her leader would criticize her.

Su Tongnuo and the others didn’t stop her, but remained calm walking ahead.

They took many pictures of Su Tongnuo and Gu Ning was in the photos too. Although Gu Ning didn’t want to be photographed she wouldn’t hide if someone was shooting them. She wasn’t a star anyway, so there was no need for her to hide.

“The girl next to her is so beautiful!” someone said.

“Indeed! Do you know who she is?” another person asked.

“No idea. I bet she’s Su Tongnuo’s assistant because she is carrying things in her hands.”

“What a waste of her beauty!”

They didn’t recognize that Gu Ning was actually the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry, but they all felt that she looked familiar.

Gu Ning and the others soon left the building of Tanghuang Entertainment, and went to Huangdeng Hotel for a meal afterwards.

Gu Ning called Zhou Zhenghong while their car was driving.

Zhou Zhenghong had just arrived at the hotel, so Gu Ning told him to rest first and they would meet at the meal.
