Chapter 1611: A Siren

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Time flew and it was soon 5 pm.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting left the siheyuan after they had dinner.

Leng Shaoting needed to go back to their military base, while Gu Ning drove back to Century City. Leng Shaoting wanted to drive Gu Ning home, but Gu Ning had her own car, so they separated at the door.

Neither of them wanted to leave each other, even though they could meet again in a few days.

“It’s impossible to hide your air of a cultivator now, so you must be very careful. Turn to Grandpa Shangguan for help if you encounter a cultivator who’s stronger than you,” said Gu Ning.

“I understand.” Leng Shaoting felt touched that Gu Ning cared about him. After all, Gu Ning kept reminding him to be careful because she cared about him.

After that, they separated. However, when Gu Ning passed a hotel, she coincidentally saw Gu Anna and saw that two women around 30 years old were pulling her with violence. Gu Anna struggled, but she was too weak before two women.

There were onlookers, but nobody went up to help Gu Anna. Although the security guards of the hotel tried to stop the two women, it wasn’t useful.

Gu Anna was Gu Ning’s friend after all, so she had to do something at this moment. Without delay, Gu Ning drove towards the door of the hotel. Once she got out of the car, she heard unpleasant remarks.

“You’re a shameless siren! How dare you seduce my husband?”

“You’re a bi*ch!”

The two women were screaming abuse at Gu Anna.

Gu Ning frowned and didn’t believe that Gu Anna would seduce a married man. Although Gu Anna dressed like a sexy woman, she was born in a super-rich family, and there was no need for her to sell her body for money. Gu Ning didn’t know much about Gu Anna, but she was aware that Gu Anna wasn’t a bad woman.

“Leave me alone! Are you crazy or something? I didn’t seduce your husband, your husband sexually harassed me. He’s ugly and disgusting!” Gu Anna was angry.

Other people might not believe her words, but Gu Ning did. She walked straight to them and pulled the two women away from Gu Anna.

Because Gu Anna was her friend, Gu Ning secretly pinched the two women when she pulled them away causing them to scream in pain.

“Ningning!” Gu Anna was surprised when she saw Gu Ning. Gu Ning was her life-saver now! No one was willing to help her and she would be super embarrassed if Gu Ning didn’t stand out.

“Who are you?”

“It’s none of your business!”

“Look at her face. They must be the same kind of shameless women!”

The two women turned to attack Gu Ning with their eyes full of jealousy. In their eyes, all beautiful girls were shameless and would seduce their husbands.

Gu Ning remained calm and coldly stared at them, but the two women were mad. “What? Don’t pretend to be innocent since you choose to be a bi*ch.”

“How dare you!” Gu Anna was furious when the two women began to humiliate Gu Ning. She felt guilty that Gu Ning suffered because of her. To her astonishment, Gu Ning moved faster than her and slapped the two women with great force.

The onlookers were all shocked by the scene. Gu Ning was too violent!

Nevertheless, it was understandable, because the two women were too aggressive and unkind. They negatively judged Gu Ning just because she was beautiful, which was unreasonable. Besides, Gu Anna said that she didn’t seduce the woman’s husband, but the women wouldn’t let her go.

“Don’t humiliate other people as you want in public,” said Gu Ning. She wasn’t afraid of the two women at all.

“You...” The two women pointed at Gu Ning in anger, but didn’t dare to fight with her.

“Do you know who I am?” shouted a woman. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“So? I don’t care,” said Gu Ning. It wasn’t her fault anyway, and she didn’t think that the two women were able to hurt her.

Gu Anna pulled her lips. “Ridiculous. Do you know who I am?”

The woman was struck dumb and didn’t know what to say. Even though Gu Anna could be more influential than her, she refused to believe it. She believed that Gu Anna had seduced her husband, even though Gu Anna already denied it.
