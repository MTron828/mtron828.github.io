Chapter 1849: Not Over Yet

“Idiot. If they didn’t know, I wouldn’t move into another dorm room,” said Gao Shiyan with impatience. She then ignored Lu Xiaoxiao and kept on packing.

Lu Xiaoxiao was full of anxiety at this moment. Although it was Gao Shiyan who hired a bunch of men to teach Gu Ning and her friends a lesson and she wasn’t involved in it, she had humiliated them with Gao Shiyan before. Gu Ning and her friends must hate her too.

If Gao Shiyan left, they could vent their anger on her instead.

No, she couldn’t stay here. She had to move out into another dorm room. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Thinking of that, Lu Xiaoxiao took action at once. She ran outside to see their head teacher. She refused to live in the same dorm room with Gu Ning and Song Miaoge.

As a result, when Gu Ning and Song Miaoge came back at night, they found both Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao were gone along with their stuff.

It was surprising, but wasn’t beyond their expectation. Anyway, it was good news.

“Well, does Gao Shiyan believe it will be over after she moves into another dorm room?” Song Miaoge said with disdain.

“At least she doesn’t need to sleep anxiously at night,” said Gu Ning.

“It’s not a bad thing. We don’t need to see her every day now,” said Song Miaoge happily.

In fact, they could make things difficult for Gao Shiyan even if she moved out. They were in the same school after all. It couldn’t be easier for them to find her.

“Um, Gu Ning, why don’t we ask Zongxue to move in?” Song Miaoge asked Gu Ning. She hoped that Baili Zongxue could live with them, but she needed to ask for Gu Ning’s opinion.

Although they were all friends and she felt that Gu Ning would want Baili Zongxue to move in with them, she asked Gu Ning out of respect.

“Why not!” Gu Ning agreed. Anyway, Baili Zongxue lived near them. It wouldn’t be a big deal if they lived together.

With Gu Ning’s agreement, Song Miaoge shared this good news with Baili Zongxue at once.

Gu Ning, Song Miaoge, and Baili Zongxue had a WeChat group, so Song Miaoge directly told Baili Zongxue in the group.

Baili Zongxue was undoubtedly happy to hear the news. Unexpectedly, she still moved into the same dorm room as Gu Ning. She was excited about it, but didn’t rush to move in right away, because she also needed her head teacher’s agreement.

Normally, their head teacher would agree.

Coincidentally, Gu Ning and her friends saw Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao when they went to have breakfast the next morning. Once Gao Shiyan saw them, she ran away in a hurry.

“Ha-ha,” Song Miaoge snorted with laughter.

Anyway, since they met, it was impossible for Gu Ning and her friends to let her go. Without delay, Gu Ning and her friends caught up and stopped her.

“W-What do you want to do?” Gao Shiyan got nervous looking at them. Because of the bad deed she had done, she felt guilty and avoided their eyes.

Gao Shiyan only dared to bully the weak and got scared after failing several times.

However, she was only afraid for the time being, and wouldn’t hesitate to make the situation worse once she got a chance.

“What do we want to do?” Song Miaoge smiled saying with disdain, “Gao Shiyan, Lu Xiaoxiao, why did you move into another dorm room all of a sudden? Gao Shiyan, do you think it’s over after that?”

“You...” Gao Shiyan moved a few steps back in fear, in case Song Miaoge and Gu Ning hurt her.

“What?” Song Miaoge walked towards Gao Shiyan in a threatening way. She made fun of Gao Shiyan as if a cat was playing with a mouse.

“Song Miaoge, if you dare to hurt me, I’ll report it to our teacher!” Gao Shiyan pretended to be brave. She tried to threaten them with the influence of their teacher.

“Well, when you tried to hurt me and Gu Ning, weren’t you afraid that we’d report it to our teacher?” said Song Miaoge with mockery. “Do you think you’re the only one who isn’t afraid of the teacher here?”

“I-I-My father is the director of the State Forestry Administration.”

Hearing that Song Miaoge wasn’t afraid of the teacher, Gao Shiyan had to rely on her father’s influence.

“Do you think the director of the State Forestry Administration is a very important official? Do you think you can do whatever you want?” said Song Miaoge with disgust. Although it was a powerful official in ordinary people’s eyes, it was merely nothing for the Song family.

“You...” Gao Shiyan was surprised. She suddenly didn’t know what to say at this moment. At the same time, she thought to herself that Song Miaoge might not come from an ordinary family as she used to believe, otherwise she should be afraid of her father’s social status.

“Gu Ning?”

Someone called Gu Ning all of a sudden. Gu Ning and her friends turned to look at the person at once.

“Hi, Senior Rong!” Seeing Rong Zechen, Gu Ning and Song Miaoge politely greeted him.

Although Song Miaoge knew Rong Jue, she wasn’t familiar with Rong Zechen. Anyway, she knew that he was a member of the Rong family as well, but she didn’t know who his father was.

It wasn’t important actually.

Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao were stunned the moment they saw Rong Zechen.

They forgot their fear of Gu Ning and Song Miaoge at this moment.

“Hi, what a coincidence!” Rong Zechen was happy to see Gu Ning.

“Oh, have you had breakfast yet? If not, let me buy it for you,” said Rong Zechen.

Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao wished that he asked them the question, but unfortunately he only asked Gu Ning.

Besides, Gu Ning was able to know such a handsome boy!

Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao were jealous of Gu Ning again.

“Thanks, but there is no need.” Gu Ning declined. She decided to keep a distance from the Rong family.

Song Miaoge had the same idea, and wasn’t interested in Rong Zechen.

“Fine.” Rong Zechen was slightly disappointed. Since Gu Ning declined, he wouldn’t insist in case Gu Ning had a bad impression of him.

“Why don’t we go to the canteen together?” asked Rong Zechen. Although Gu Ning turned his invitation down, they could go to the canteen together.

“Senior Rong, you can go first. I still need to deal with something else now,” said Gu Ning. She had no intention of sharing breakfast with him.

“Fine.”

Rong Zechen said nothing further about it and left alone.

Once Rong Zechen was gone, Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao turned to face Gu Ning and Song Miaoge again.

“Alright, we should go to have breakfast now,” said Gu Ning. She gave up punishing Gao Shiyan right now. In fact, even if she was going to do something to hurt Gao Shiyan, she would do it secretly.

She would never do it in public, because it could cause her trouble.

Gao Shiyan felt relieved and felt that Gu Ning didn’t dare to hurt her. However, the next second, Gu Ning gave her a fake smile, which gave Gao Shiyan a premonition.
