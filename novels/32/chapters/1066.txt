Chapter 1068 A Warning to the Lu Family

Hearing that, everyone was shocked by Lu Weiwei.Although Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning indeed hadn’t got married yet, they were already engaged. She was challenging Gu Ning by saying that to Gu Ning’s face.

Leng Shaoting was mad this time, and glared at Lu Weiwei.

Lu Weiwei felt scared. Even though she knew both of them were annoyed now, she was unwilling to give up because Leng Shaoting was the most handsome man she had ever seen.

Witnessing Lu Weiwei’s inappropriate behavior, Lu Weili had no intention to stop her. Nobody could tell what he was thinking.

Zhang Dequan was willing to support Gu Ning, but he also knew that Gu Ning wasn’t a weak girl.

“Miss Lu, it sounds that you’re very confident about yourself, but I think that you’re no match for me,” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning seldom attacked others in public, but Lu Weiwei was asking for it.

“You...” Lu Weiwei was mad when Gu Ning despised her. “I was born in the Lu family!”

“So? I’m the boss of Colorful Jade Provider!” Gu Ning said. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“A jade provider is barely comparable to my family’s wealth,” Lu Weiwei said with disdain. Lu Weiwei had heard little about Colorful Jade Provider, so she thought that it wasn’t important.

“Weiwei.” Lu Weili had to stop her at this moment.

Although a jade company was indeed barely comparable to their family’s wealth, it wasn’t a good thing if they had a bad relationship with its boss. Colorful Jade Provider was one of the three most famous jade companies in City Teng after all.

Lu Weili didn’t care about Gu Ning, but he was afraid of the real boss behind her back.

Zhang Dequan and the others thought that Lu Weiwei was quite stupid after hearing her opinion of Colorful Jade Provider. She had no idea how fierce the competition in the jade business in City Teng was.

“Am I wrong?” Lu Weiwei didn’t think she was wrong.

Gu Ning laughed a little. “You’re right. A jade company isn’t worth mentioning compared with your family’s wealth, but I had ruined the Wang family before I built Colorful Jade Provider.”

“You?” Lu Weiwei was shocked.

Lu Weili also rounded his eyes in shock. They had heard news about it, but didn’t believe that a young girl could do that.

In addition, the Wang family was ruined because many of their dirty secrets were exposed, so they believed that it must have been the Wang family’s enemies in politics who had done it.

To their astonishment, Gu Ning told them that she was the person who had unseated the Wang family.

“It’s impossible!” Lu Weili blurted it out.

“Well, I simply gave the Wang family’s enemies a helping hand. That’s it,” Gu Ning said with a smile, which was scary.

She wasn’t showing off her ability, but gave the Lu family a warning. If it was possible, Gu Ning preferred to spend less time on scheming against them.

“Lord Lu, I have no intention to become the Lu family’s enemy, so I hope we can mind our own business. If you really dislike me, I don’t mind playing the game with you,” Gu Ning said and warned. After that, she looked at Lu Weiwei. “Miss Lu, don’t ever leer at my man again, or you’ll regret what you’ve done.”

Lu Weili was stunned, and didn’t know what to say now.

“You...” Lu Weiwei was furious, and still wanted to argue with Gu Ning.

“Weiwei, shut up!”

Before Lu Weiwei could say anything else, Lu Weili stopped her. No matter what, they shouldn’t have conflict against Gu Ning now.

Lu Weiwei pouted, but had to listen to her older brother.

“Let’s go now!” Gu Ning hated to stay here for a second longer, so she walked out at once, followed by Leng Shaoting. Zhang Dequan and the others also left soon.

...

“Weiwei, don’t do that again,” Lu Weili said to Lu Weiwei.

“I understand,” Lu Weiwei said, but she was still reluctant to give Leng Shaoting up.

...

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to the first shop of jade raw materials after walking out of the restaurant.

Compared with the stands, there were far fewer shops, so it didn’t take long for them to look around the jade raw materials. There were only one or two hundred jade raw materials in each of those shops.

It was more likely to find jade of high quality in select jade raw materials.

Among the one or two hundred jade raw materials, there could be more than five pieces of medium-high-level jade.
