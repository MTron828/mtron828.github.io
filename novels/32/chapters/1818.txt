Chapter 1819: Power Gathering Formation

Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary student. If she asked for leave, she would need to deal with something important, while other students normally left to have fun.

It was almost 6 pm when they dispersed, so Gu Ning directly walked away without going back to her dorm room to change her clothes.

Qiao Ya had driven Gu Ning’s car home, so Gu Ning had told her to pick her up later once the military training was over. Therefore, at this time, Qiao Ya was already waiting for her at the gate of their school.

The moment Gu Ning walked outside, she got in the car and left.

Because she didn’t want to keep Leng Shaoting waiting for her, she told Qiao Ya to drive as fast as possible. Unfortunately, there was a lot of traffic on the road, so it was nearly 7 pm when they arrived at the siheyuan.

Once they arrived, Gu Ning somehow felt strange. Both Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao should be in the siheyuan right now, but she couldn’t sense any magical power. Why?

Gu Ning didn’t go inside right away, but used her Jade Eyes to see what was going on here.

She saw the living room and noticed Shangguan Yang, Leng Shaoting, and Jing Yunyao. At the same time, Shangguan Yang and Jing Yunyao turned in her direction. It was obvious that they found out about her peeking.

They indeed felt that someone was secretly looking at them, but they didn’t have a pair of Jade Eyes, so they couldn’t see the person.

Leng Shaoting was at a lower level, so he failed to notice it. Gu Ning only gave them a glance and soon withdrew her sight.

Even though they didn’t know who was secretly looking at them, Shangguan Yang understood it could be Gu Ning. Gu Ning might have found something wrong with the siheyuan after she came, so she used her Jade Eyes to check the situation first.

“What’s wrong?” Leng Shaoting asked. He failed to sense that someone was secretly looking at them, but he learned something wasn’t right from Shangguan Yang and Jing Yunyao’s reaction.

“Nothing, Ningning must be here,” said Shangguan Yang.

Jing Yunyao was slightly surprised, not because Shangguan Yang was able to know who came here, but because the person turned out to be Gu Ning. She was curious about how Gu Ning managed to peek into the inside of the house.

Although she was surprised, she didn’t ask about it. She wasn’t aware of Gu Ning’s Jade Eyes, but she knew that Gu Ning had unbelievable skills.

Before long, Gu Ning came inside.

She told Qiao Ya to leave before her, because it wasn’t appropriate for Qiao Ya to dine together with them. However, the car was left in the siheyuan, because Gu Ning needed to drive it back to her school.

Once Gu Ning walked in, she felt magical power floating in the siheyuan, which surprised her.

Shangguan Yang and the others were chatting in the living room while waiting for her. They hadn’t eaten yet, even though Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting that they could enjoy the meal without waiting for her.

They insisted on waiting for Gu Ning to have dinner together. It wasn’t easy for them to gather together for a meal after all.

The second Gu Ning showed up, she met Leng Shaoting’s eyes which were full of suppressed desire. Because Leng Shaoting didn’t want other people to notice it, he deliberately suppressed his desire for Gu Ning.

Gu Ning also missed him very much, but she composed herself. The others saw their reaction, but didn’t think it was wrong.

They were boyfriend and girlfriend after all. It was quite understandable that they missed each other after being apart for so long.

“Hi, Grandpa Shangguan, mother.” Gu Ning greeted them.

“Have a seat!” Shangguan Yang said.

Gu Ning then went to sit and Lao Zhang began to place dishes on the table.

Because they knew that Gu Ning wouldn’t leave until 6 pm and it could be 7 pm when she arrived, they told Lao Zhang to cook later. Therefore, the dishes were still warm.

It was hot today actually, so it was fine to have some cool food.

They enjoyed the meal while chatting with each other.

“Grandpa Shangguan, why didn’t I sense any air of cultivators outside the door just now? I felt floating magical power after walking inside instead,” said Gu Ning.

“I’ve set up a power gathering formation here, because across the river from this siheyuan is the imperial palace. The imperial palace is the residence of the emperors of the past dynasties. Emperors are men of power. Although they are all dead today, their power is still left, but it’s relatively weak, so I set up a formation to attract the power over and lock it up within the siheyuan. Therefore, the magical power inside the siheyuan won’t be discovered by people from the outside. Even if cultivators pass by here, they wouldn’t sense us or the magical power, unless his or her level is higher than mine,” said Shangguan Yang.

“Oh, I understand.” Gu Ning nodded.

Afterwards, they dropped the topic.

This time, Leng Shaoting and the others would go to Kunlun Mountain by a private jet and directly land at City Ge. It could save a lot of time and they were able to come back at any time.

Gu Ning wanted to go there with them, but her military training wasn’t over yet.

She could ask for leave, but it wasn’t necessary.

During these days, she still failed to make the magical power in her soul circulate in her body. There was a cultivator living in the dorm room next to hers, so she had to be very cautious not to expose her secret.

Although Shangguan Yang had told her that even cultivators couldn’t see the change of her body with the help of Blood of the Phoenix, she still needed to be careful.

Besides, she couldn’t be interrupted during cultivation and she needed a quiet safe place, so the dorm room wasn’t suitable for cultivation even if Baili Zongxue wasn’t around.

Therefore, Gu Ning could only leave the cultivation aside. She decided to do it later in a quiet, safe place when she was free. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After having dinner, Shangguan Yang had a private talk with Gu Ning in the study.

“You told me not to tell Shaoting, so I didn’t say anything about it. It’s not convenient for you to cultivate in your school, while this siheyuan is the best place for you. No one will know what you’re doing here,” said Shangguan Yang.

“Grandpa Shangguan, did you set it up specially for me?” Gu Ning was touched.

“For you and for Shaoting as well. He better stay here after coming back from his work, because there are many cultivators in the capital,” said Shangguan Yang.

Even though it wasn’t all for her, Gu Ning still felt touched, because what Leng Shaoting was doing was as important as what she wanted to achieve.

“Blood of the Phoenix is a great source of magical power itself. It contains endless magical power. Therefore, it doesn’t matter to you whether there is magical power in the outside world. You don’t need to be worried about the thinner magical power in the outside world either,” said Shangguan Yang.

“Sure, Grandpa Shangguan,” said Gu Ning.

Shangguan Yang told Gu Ning that because he would be absent these days. No one would be in the siheyuan. Stone and Lao Zhang would have a vacation too. Accordingly, it was the best place for Gu Ning to cultivate.

After Shangguan Yang finished the private talk with Gu Ning, Gu Ning stayed with them for another while before going back to her school. Shangguan Yang and the others also left, because time was precious.
