Chapter 1827: You Did That On Purpose!

Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Even if Song Miaoge had been training hard in the past six months, Ji Wenna had done the same thing. She was already better than Song Miaoge, so she didn’t think that she would make slower progress than Song Miaoge.

Although Ji Wenna’s voice wasn’t loud, it wasn’t low either, so many customers turned to look at them.

Bikini? Pole dancing? It’ll be recorded in a video and uploaded to the Internet? It’ll definitely go viral.

Because of those words, Song Miaoge and Ji Wenna became bad girls in the eyes of other people and they began to stare at them with a little contempt and disdain.

Song Miaoge was annoyed, but couldn’t deny the bet that they had made, because there was written evidence.

“Let’s go and see! I will defeat you,” Song Miaoge said with determination, but she didn’t have much confidence.

No matter what, she couldn’t lose. If she lost, she would have to wear a bikini, pole dance, and post the video to the Internet. If it really happened, not only she would be embarrassed, her family, the Song family, would also be humiliated.

However, she was left no choice now. She had agreed to such a condition because Ji Wenna had provoked her into doing so.

“Very well, then I’ll wait for you to defeat me, but don’t let me down!” Ji Wenna smiled, then ignored Song Miaoge and directly passed her, walking to look at herself in the mirror.

As she passed by Song Miaoge, she deliberately bumped her shoulder, deliberately provoking her.

“You...” Song Miaoge was very angry and was about to lose her temper, but she forced herself to calm down upon thinking that this was Gu Ning’s store.

Both Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue had witnessed everything, so they were displeased and felt uncomfortable as well.

Song Miaoge was no longer interested in looking at the clothes, and gave up trying on the dress. She turned around to hang it back up.

At this time, Gu Ning walked to Song Miaoge and asked her, “Do you want to watch her get angry?”

Hearing this, Song Miaoge’s eyes lit up. She knew that Gu Ning had a way, so she immediately nodded. “Of course.”

“Watch me,” Gu Ning said, then she took the dress from her hands and walked towards the fitting room.

Gu Ning decided to overshadow Ji Wenna.

Gu Ning didn’t think that she was the most beautiful and sexy girl in existence, but she was confident to overshadow Ji Wenna.

Since her friend was bullied in her shop, she had to do something.

After Gu Ning walked into the fitting room, Song Miaoge thought it might not be a good idea. She asked Baili Zongxue, “Will Gu Ning lose a customer?”

“Relax, if Gu Ning cared about that, she wouldn’t stand up for you. Don’t worry, Gu Ning won’t care. If I were her, I would do the same thing. I believe you have the same idea, right? We’re friends. We should help each other.” Baili Zongxue comforted Song Miaoge. She was more relaxed than her.

“Right, if you had been bullied, I would definitely stand up for you too.” Song Miaoge felt much better after hearing Baili Zongxue’s words.

Then they waited quietly for Gu Ning to come out.

Gu Ning came in a loose T-shirt, loose jeans, and casual shoes today with a hat, so no one paid special attention to her. However, now Gu Ning put on the dress with a pair of high heels from her telepathic eye space. With her hair in a high ponytail, she took out cosmetics and quickly put on light makeup. She looked totally different.

Ji Wenna was still wearing that dress while looking at the clothes outside. She already made a decision to buy this dress, but she still needed to look at the others. Since she was here, she planned to buy a few more.

After Gu Ning finished everything, she walked out.

Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue knew that Gu Ning never made mistakes once she took action, but they were both stunned the second Gu Ning showed up again. They were dumbfounded, unable to react for a while.

Other people in the store who saw Gu Ning were also amazed.

“Gosh! It’s so beautiful!”

“Yeah! I thought that the girl looked good in this dress just now, but I didn’t expect this girl to look even better in it.”

“It’s just tailor-made for her!”

“...”

Once a saleswoman noticed it, she figured out that her boss was going to take revenge for her friend. In the bottom of her heart, she couldn’t help but envy her boss’s friend. Her boss was such a good friend!

A true friend must be like that!

Gu Ning wouldn’t hesitate to help her friends once she saw them bullied.

The sounds of surprise and praise immediately attracted the attention of Ji Wenna, and she immediately came to take a look. After one glance, her face became distorted with jealousy.

Jealousy and hatred couldn’t be concealed on her face.

“Jesus! Gu Ning, you are so beautiful in this dress.” Once Song Miaoge came back to her senses, she walked up to Gu Ning, and left all her worries and unhappiness behind.

“Well, it’s because she’s beautiful and has a perfect body that she looks attractive in all the clothes. You can randomly pick up a piece of clothing for Gu Ning to try on. It will definitely look good too,” Baili Zongxue said. It wasn’t an exaggeration at all.

“You’re right. She’s beautiful and has a perfect body, so she’s attractive in any clothes.” Song Miaoge immediately agreed.

“Song Miaoge, you did that on purpose!” Ji Wenna went to Song Miaoge without delay, glaring at her in fury.

They were in a group. Now Gu Ning put on this dress and looked even better than her. She wasn’t a fool, and could see that they did it on purpose.

Song Miaoge looked back at Ji Wenna, with disdain in her heart, but she seemed innocent on the surface and asked, “What did I do on purpose? I don’t understand what you said.”

“Stop playing dumb. You know you can’t look as good as me in this dress, so you asked her to wear it and deliberately overshadow me,” Ji Wenna said. She said that, which meant she admitted that Gu Ning looked better than her in this dress.

It was too obvious to be denied.

Hearing that, other people who knew that Ji Wenna and Song Miaoge had a conflict just now knew what was going on. However, they didn’t think there was anything wrong with Gu Ning’s behavior. After all, Ji Wenna’s disdainful expression just now made everyone feel uncomfortable.

“It’s ridiculous. How can you forbid other people to wear this dress? This shop is open for everyone. There are two of the same dresses, which means that you are not the only one who can buy it. You can’t forbid other people to buy it! My friend just tried on this dress, and she didn’t stop you from buying it,” Song Miaoge said.

“You...” Ji Wenna was annoyed. No one said that she couldn’t buy it, but she lost interest in it after seeing another girl looking prettier in it than her.

Song Miaoge continued, “If you don’t want other girls to wear it, you can buy all of the stock in this store!”
