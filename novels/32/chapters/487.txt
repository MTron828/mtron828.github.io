Chapter 489 Shoot a Movie II

Photography Team: Camera, Additional Camera, Assistant Camera, Gaffer.

Art Team: Set Dresser, Wardrobe Supervisor, Makeup Artists, Hair-stylist.

Recording Team: Boom Operator, Sound Mixer.

All the above-mentioned workers were needed and some of them would do many jobs at the same time.

“All is well,” Lu Zhan said. “It’s my cousin’s team. Because he’s been influenced by me ever since he was a child, he works in the entertainment industry as well. Although he isn’t famous, the quality of his team is quite good. My peers don’t know that I’m back in the industry and none of them are willing to help me, so I directly hired him.”

Although Lu Zhan was fully in charge of the crew, Gu Ning was his boss after all, so it was necessary for him to report to her.

“Great. How many are there?” Gu Ning asked.

“Sixteen in all,” Lu Zhan said.

“Very well. Take the earliest flight to City D now. We need to shoot a movie as soon as possible, and I’ve borrowed the accouterments, so you all just need to bring your own clothes. We’ll talk about the details after your landing, and I’ll arrange someone to pick you up,” Gu Ning said seriously.

“Sure, I’ll gather them right now,” Lu Zhan said. He realized that it was an emergency, and it was his boss’s order, so he couldn’t reject.

After that, Gu Ning called Duan Lixin and Su Tongnuo. She told them to take the earliest plane to City D too.

Other than that, Gu Ning also called Chu Peihan, Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping to help her, because she knew that they were often absent from classes. It wouldn’t be a big deal if they asked for a leave for a week.

Gu Ning didn’t tell them details, and told them to keep it a secret, in case it would affect their other friends’ studying.

Since Gu Ning needed their help, they flew to City D as fast as they could.

Gu Ning called K then, and told him to investigate who had posted the news on the Internet. When K read the post he was shocked too, and couldn’t believe it.

None of them were in the mood to enjoy the meal after the video had been released on the Internet.

Before long, Su Tongnuo, Duan Lixin and Chu Peihan and others booked their plane tickets to City D, but Lu Zhan still needed some time to settle the plane tickets for such a large group.

Su Tongnuo would arrive at Changyang Mountain around 11:30 pm. Duan Lixin would arrive 50 minutes earlier than Su Tongnuo. While Chu Peihan, Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping would be the first group to meet Gu Ning, because they would arrive around 10 pm.

After finishing those calls, Gu Ning told Jiang Bowen to arrange cars to pick them up according to their landing time.

It was just 7 pm when Gu Ning was finally free for a while. Jiang Bowen planned to book a room for her at Quanlin Resort, but Gu Ning declined. Gu Ning had the Black Card for the Huangdeng Hotel, and she could have free accommodation there, so there was no need for her to spend money on hotels.

When the others found out that Gu Ning had the Black Card for the Huangdeng Hotel, they were surprised again. Huangdeng Hotel was a well-known international five-star hotel chain, and it was very popular domestically and abroad. In addition, it was very rare to meet a person who had a Black Card for the Huangdeng Hotel because the Tang Family only gave Black Cards to their relatives or those who had a close relationship with them.

All of a sudden, they suddenly thought of the first call Gu Ning had made. She had called the person “Uncle Tang” on the phone and the person could be a member of the Tang Family! Even though they were all curious, none of them asked the question.

K was efficient as always. When Gu Ning had just left the Quanlin Resort, she received his call.

“Boss, the person is Tan Jiangfeng, who is a doctor working in the Central Hospital,” K said.

Hearing that, Gu Ning was displeased. If it was Tan Jiangfeng who had posted the news on the Internet, he obviously aimed to hurt her. If she hadn’t embarrassed him, he wouldn’t have spread the news abroad. In that case, Gu Ning was the cause of the trouble. If so, she made up her mind to handle it well.

“Oh, boss, is the news real?” K asked with curiosity.

“Do you believe it?” Gu Ning replied.

“I didn’t believe it, but now I doubt it after watching the video,” K said.

“Alright, I gotta go.” Gu Ning hung up directly. K was struck dumb on the other side of the phone. Shouldn’t she tell him whether it was real or not?

Chen Cangyi was almost fully recovered, but K stayed in the hospital to keep him company. Seeing that K was struck dumb, he suddenly thought that K was a little adorable. Chen Cangyi immediately got rid of the idea in his mind and asked, “Is it real?”

“She didn’t tell me,” K sounded aggrieved and looked a little gay.

Jiang Bowen asked Gu Ning later, “Miss Gu, have you found out who posted the news on the Internet yet?”

“Tan Jiangfeng,” Gu Ning said plainly. “I think that he was aiming to hurt me because he felt humiliated today when I successfully rescued those injured people.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“What?” Jiang Bowen was greatly surprised. “I didn’t expect Tan Jiangfeng to be such a selfish and mean person! How can he do that just to vent his negative emotions!”

“Miss Gu, it has nothing to do with you, and you don’t need to blame yourself for it. If it hadn’t been for you, those injured miners could have died already. As for the zombie, none of us except you, knew how to destroy it.” Jiang Bowen comforted Gu Ning.

Gu Ning didn’t say anything, because what Jiang Bowen had just said was true. She had saved many people’s lives.

Since they already knew that it was Tan Jiangfeng who had posted the news on the Internet, they decided to deal with him later.

Before Gu Ning arrived at the hotel, she received Lu Zhan’s call, Lu Zhan’s group would be arriving in City D around 11 pm.
