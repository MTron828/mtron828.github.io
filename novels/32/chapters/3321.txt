3324 Beat Her If You’re Mad

On the way back, some of them were too full to even walk steadily.

“Oh, if only someone could carry me back!” Xiong Manxin was exhausted.

“None of us will carry you, but there is a person who’s willing to do it. I promise he’ll run to you in no time,” An Chenmeng said, teasingly.

Xiong Manxin was immediately irritated. “Nonsense! Do you want me to beat you?”

“Go ahead and try to beat me if you can.” An Chenmeng retorted, looking for trouble.

Frustrated, Xiong Manxin turned to Leng Xiaoyao for help. “Xiaoyao, An Chenmeng bullied me.” she complained.

“Fight back if you can. If not, just bear with it.” Leng Xiaoyao replied, not taking sides.

Xiong Manxin was too angry to say another word. Everyone laughed at her and she lost interest. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

She couldn’t defeat An Chenmeng.

The person An Chenmeng referred to was actually a boy from Class 5 who had been crushing on Xiong Manxin for a long time.

However, he didn’t dare to confess his feelings for her.

With the National College Entrance Examination coming up, he decided to take a chance and tell her how he felt, but Xiong Manxin wouldn’t accept him.

She was in no mood for a romantic relationship. Even if she wanted to have a boyfriend, she would wait till she studied in the university.

Besides, the boy wasn’t her type. She rejected him and even scolded him.

However, the boy was persistent and kept approaching her, much to her annoyance.

She wanted to hit him, but restrained herself unless he attacked her first.

As luck would have it, Xiong Manxin ran into the boy.

Due to Leng Xiaoyao’s presence, he didn’t dare to come over so Xiong Manxin was relieved.

“This guy is so annoying. I feel like hitting him every time I see him.” Xiong Manxin complained to Leng Xiaoyao.

“Just ignore him. If he continues to bother you, threaten him and tell the teacher if he persists. If he distracts you from studying and you make mistakes during the National College Entrance Examination, it will be his fault,” said Leng Xiaoyao. She never had a good attitude towards people who caused her trouble, so she didn’t think her suggestion was wrong.

Furthermore, Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t understand why the boy would confess his feelings and pursue Xiong Manxin so close to the National College Entrance Examination. If the boy was worried about missing the chance, he could wait until the exam was over.

Wasn’t it just causing trouble for Xiong Manxi at this time when everyone was busy with the exam?

None of them had interest in a romantic relationship right now.

If it affected Xiong Manxin’s studies, it would also affect her performance at the National College Entrance Examination.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to be conspiratorial, but this kind of behavior that she couldn’t explain with normal thinking made her think more.

The boy persisted even though Xiong Manxin had rejected him multiple times and even scolded him.

“Okay.” Xiong Manxin didn’t think there was anything wrong with it.

Therefore, when the boy came to see Xiong Manxin again in the afternoon, she threatened him. The boy was scared and angry, then left dejectedly.

After that, he didn’t come to see Xiong Manxin in the following days.

…

Leng Xiaoyao had finished drawing the game characters, so the next step was programming. Because the program and code were deeply imprinted in Leng Xiaoyao’s mind, she found it very easy to do.

In addition to game characters, there were also settings, which were drawn by Mu Yufan and his team.

They weren’t very good at programming games, but they could draw the required scenery.

They didn’t know much about programming games, but they played games a lot. Therefore, after repeated communication with Leng Xiaoyao, they also knew what kind of settings were needed.

After drawing them, Leng Xiaoyao made some modifications and only used them when she was satisfied.

Regarding the matter of Leng Xiaoyao claiming to be able to draw the game characters in a month but going over the deadline, Mu Yufan and the others understood it quite well. In fact, when Leng Xiaoyao first mentioned it, they already thought it was too rushed.

Although Leng Xiaoyao failed to deliver on her promise, she didn’t feel embarrassed about it. She wasn’t a saint and couldn’t do everything she said she would.

Anyway, she learned to leave herself some leeway in the future.

When the game would be released wasn’t urgent, and it was all up to Leng Xiaoyao. To avoid any issues, it was safer to spend more time on it.

Three days after Leng Xiaoyao returned home, Wu Wensi sent her the design images. After seeing them, Leng Xiaoyao was quite satisfied and asked Wu Wensi to calculate the cost and send someone to sign the contract in City Chang. She didn’t have time to go to the capital city.

Wu Wensi had no objections about sending someone to sign the contract in City Chang since it was a renovation contract worth millions of yuan. He wouldn’t hesitate to spend a few thousand dollars on a round-trip ticket.

Wu Wensi did the design on his own, so he needed to sign the contract in person.

In fact, Wu Wensi was the boss, so he didn’t need to personally handle everything. However, for Li Mochen’s sake, he decided to deal with it himself.

He didn’t feel reluctant at all.

Because Leng Xiaoyao’s renovation was urgent, Wu Wensi prepared the contract overnight and flew to City Chang early in the morning. They met at noon.

“I didn’t expect you to come in person, Mr. Wu,” Leng Xiaoyao said, a little surprised because Wu Wensi didn’t mention it earlier.

“I came in person for peace of mind. Don’t call me Mr. Wu so formally. Just call me Brother Wu,” Wu Wensi said.

Even though they had only met once, Wu Wensi treated Leng Xiaoyao as if she was part of his circle because of her relationship with Li Mochen. He didn’t like the formalities.

“Sure.” Leng Xiaoyao agreed. Since he was introduced by Li Mochen, he was trustworthy, and she didn’t need to keep a distance.

“Take a look at the design and the contract.” Wu Wensi handed over both the design and contract documents.

“Okay.” Leng Xiaoyao took them and looked at the design first, even though she had seen them on her computer before.

After confirming that everything was okay with the design, she looked at the contract, which included a quotation sheet.

The material quality and brands were all in accordance with Leng Xiaoyao’s requirements. Although she hadn’t researched the prices for these things, she trusted Wu Wensi.

To be more accurate, she trusted Li Mochen.

After reading through the contract without any issues, Leng Xiaoyao signed her name.

The renovation cost increased due to Leng Xiaoyao’s requirements for higher quality materials and additional labor costs, but overall, it wasn’t too expensive.
