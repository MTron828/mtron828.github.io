Chapter 1135 My Hands Are Tied

Although Mrs. Guo’s phone was taken away from her, Guo Deping could still see her. He criticized Mrs. Guo the moment he saw her.Mrs. Guo didn’t dare to keep it a secret from her husband, and told Guo Deping that it was Jiang Shuyuan’s idea. She still hoped that Jiang Shuyuan could help her out.

Even though Leng Shaoting wasn’t someone they could mess with, they still needed to try.

Guo Deping was unwilling to see his wife being detained, which was humiliating in his eyes, so he agreed to call Jiang Shuyuan.

Jiang Shuyuan was shocked when she heard the news from Guo Deping.

“What? She failed?” Jiang Shuyuan didn’t care that Mrs. Guo was detained, but the plan failed. She was actually mad at Mrs. Guo for ruining it.

Hearing Jiang Shuyuan’s tone, Guo Deping understood that it wasn’t very likely that she would help his wife out.

In fact, it was Jiang Shuyuan’s idea, and his wife was detained because of her idea. However, Jiang Shuyuan didn’t care about what had happened to his wife, but blamed his wife for everything.

Guo Deping had to calm himself down because he needed Jiang Shuyuan’s help now.

“Mrs. Leng, please help us. Only you can bail my wife out now,” Guo Deping said.

“Fine, I’ll try,” Jiang Shuyuan said. She knew that Mrs. Guo was detained because of her idea, so she was willing to make a call.

Guo Deping didn’t tell her that Leng Shaoting was also involved, because he was afraid that she might refuse to help him once she knew.

After hanging up the call with Guo Deping, Jiang Shuyuan called Fang Dongcheng. She was confident that Fang Dongcheng would listen to her when she called him.

Nevertheless, to her surprise, Fang Dongcheng turned her down. “Mrs. Leng, I’m sorry, I can’t release Mrs. Guo because she’s guilty. If I let her go, I’ll be punished by my leader.”

Hearing that, Jiang Shuyuan was displeased.

“Director Fang, do you think you’re powerful enough to act against the Leng family?” she coldly said.

“Of course not! Mrs. Leng, I honestly want to help you if I could, but my hands are tied. Lord Leng called me in person and the boss of Charm is his friend,” Fang Dongcheng said.

Leng Shaoting had told him not to release Mrs. Guo no matter who called him.

“What? Leng Shaoting is also involved in this?” Jiang Shuyuan was astonished, then accepted it because she knew that Gu Ning was Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend. She totally forgot about it when she came up with the scheme.

“Mrs. Leng, I’m afraid that I’ve gotta go. I’m sorry,” Fang Dongcheng said and hung up at once. He was reluctant to argue with Jiang Shuyuan.

Actually, Fang Dongcheng was an upright man, and he wouldn’t yield to power.

Although Jiang Shuyuan had nothing else to say, she still felt humiliated when Fang Dongcheng hung up on her.

After making the call, she felt cornered.

It was impossible that Leng Shaoting would agree to release Mrs. Guo. Besides, if Leng Shaoting found out that it was her idea, he might cause her trouble too.

Jiang Shuyuan was afraid of Leng Shaoting to some extent, and Master Leng cared a lot about him. If Master Leng learned about it, she would be in big trouble. Therefore, Jiang Shuyuan had to exclude herself from it.

She called Guo Deping later, and said that she couldn’t help him because Leng Shaoting was also involved in it.

It wasn’t a surprising answer, but Guo Deping was still disappointed. However, no matter how he hated Jiang Shuyuan, he could do nothing about it now. He had to give it up.

Jiang Shuyuan was worried that Mrs. Guo might betray her, so she said, “Chairman Guo, I understand that it’s my fault that your wife is detained, but I promise I’ll do my best to help you in the future as long as you need my support.”

Hearing that, Guo Deping felt a little better.

Since he couldn’t bail his wife out, there was no need for him to annoy Jiang Shuyuan, which was useless. Anyway, Jiang Shuyuan promised to help him in the future, which wasn’t the worst result. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

At 6:30 pm, the official Weibo account of Dongcheng District Branch sent out the truth of the case, and thousands of Internet users reposted it within a short time.

After this drama, more people got to know about Charm, and the reputation of Changyue Organization was damaged at the same time.

Guo Deping then realized that he should find out who had posted those articles and photos on social media in the first place.

He soon got the result that those reporters were hired by Mrs. Guo.
