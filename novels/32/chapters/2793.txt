Chapter 2794: He’s Cured

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“She said she could heal Kane, so I let her try it,” Kirk Thomas said, but in a perfunctory tone, because he didn’t believe Gu Ning could heal Kane Thomas at all.

“Are you crazy? Do you really believe her? She’s so young and is a foreigner…” Kirk Thomas’s wife said in disbelief when she heard his reply. Besides, she didn’t believe Gu Ning mainly because she was too young. At such a young age, what could she do?

“We’ll stay here to watch her. If anything goes wrong with Kane, she’ll be punished by us,” Kirk Thomas said.

“No, I can’t let Kane take the risk.” Kirk Thomas’s wife still wouldn’t allow them to do that, because Kane Thomas wasn’t just injured in the head.

“Enough, shut up now! I can make this decision.” Kirk Thomas immediately snapped at his wife because of her arguing. She clearly didn’t respect his decision at all.

Gu Ning, on the other hand, ignored their quarrel and observed Kane Thomas’s body as soon as she came in.

Surprisingly, she found that the injury on Kane Thomas wasn’t as simple as a head injury, there was already an illness in his head.

Gu Ning had also learned about a lot of diseases recently, so from the condition of the blood vessels in Kane’s brain, Gu Ning guessed that it could be a cardiovascular disease.

Cardiovascular diseases were a general term for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, which generally referred to ischemic or hemorrhagic diseases of the heart, brain and whole body caused by hyperlipidemia, blood viscosity, atherosclerosis, hypertension, etc.

Cardiovascular diseases were diseases that seriously threatened a human’s life. They were difficult to treat and had a very high mortality rate. They usually occurred in people after middle age, but it didn’t mean that it didn’t occur in young people.

However, no matter what kind of disease Kane Thomas had, as long as he still had a breath, Gu Ning could save him.

It was imperative to save Kane Thomas, because in this case, it would be easier to help Leng Shaojia out. After helping Leng Shaojia out, she would pay the Thomas family back for what they had done.

After Kirk Thomas’s wife was scolded by him, she dared not to stay another word, although she was still unwilling to let Gu Ning treat Kane. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Kyle Thomas stood on the side and said nothing. He didn’t believe that Gu Ning could cure Kane Thomas, but he wanted to let her treat him. It would be best if Gu Ning failed.

Although Kane Thomas was his own older brother, he was jealous of the fact that his older brother was so good at everything even though he was so sick.

He was also afraid that Kane Thomas would become the heir after being cured.

Although their father didn’t like Kane Thomas either, their grandfather liked him! And their grandfather would decide who was the heir.

“Do it now!” Kirk Thomas said to Gu Ning.

Gu Ning walked forward, took out a power crystal, and helped Kane Thomas take it. Nobody stopped her from doing that. Since they needed her to treat Kane, it was unavoidable that she let Kane take something.

After helping Kane Thomas take a power crystal, Gu Ning rubbed his temples and secretly put magical power into his body.

After about three minutes, Kane Thomas started looking better, which surprised everyone.

Although it didn’t mean he was cured, countless experts and doctors had been unable to make him get better.

As a result, Kyle Thomas suddenly felt it might not be good news for him.

At this moment, Kirk Thomas had complicated feelings. Although he didn’t like this son and wasn’t very sad when his son had an accident, he was still happy to treat Kane if he could be cured.

Kirk Thomas’s wife cherished both sons, so she was happy to see that her elder son looked better now.

“Can my son be fully cured?” asked Kirk Thomas’s wife.

“I need silence,” said Gu Ning. She didn’t really need that, but simply didn’t want to hear their arguments.

This time, Kirk Thomas’s wife didn’t get mad and said nothing. As long as Gu Ning could save her son, she would apologize to Gu Ning for her bad attitude.

In the following minutes, Kane Thomas started looking better and better, and his breath became stronger and stronger.

Earlier, Kane Thomas’s breath was very weak, and he had been on the verge of death.

Kane’s improvement made Kyle Thomas even more anxious. He really wanted to interrupt Gu Ning’s treatment of Kane Thomas right away, but he didn’t dare to do that, so he could only watch anxiously.

About seven or eight minutes later, Kane Thomas woke up, which shocked everyone. At the same time, Kirk Thomas’s wife was very excited and happy. She rushed over immediately. “Kane, how do you feel now?”

When Kane Thomas woke up, Gu Ning stopped at once. Kane Thomas’s cardiovascular and cerebral blood vessels were mostly cleared so he could recover in a few months with the help of drugs.

Gu Ning could completely cure him, but she wouldn’t.

Gu Ning didn’t miss the unhappiness on Kyle Thomas’s face, and guessed that he didn’t want Kane Thomas to get better. If it was for power, there was going to be a drama in the Thomas family after Kane Thomas recovered.

“Mom, what happened to me?” Kane Thomas had just woken up, so he didn’t know what was going on.

Before Kirk Thomas’s wife said anything, Gu Ning opened her mouth first. “You had an argument with my friend, and she accidentally pushed you to the ground and you knocked your head against it. So you were in a coma. However, I’ve not only cured your new injury, but also cured your old disease. You had blocked cardiovascular blood vessels. The mortality rate of this disease is extremely high. You must have turned to doctors for help for a long time! Now you can ask a doctor to come over and give you a medical checkup. So, in order to thank me, can the conflict between you and my friend be forgiven? After all, you sexually harassed her first. You didn’t do it right.”

Gu Ning understood that Kirk Thomas wouldn’t just let it go, so she asked Kane Thomas directly. If he agreed to let them go and they were able to leave smoothly, then she wouldn’t make it difficult for Kane Thomas.

As for Kirk Thomas’s calculations and humiliation to the Leng family, she would pay him back.

Hearing Gu Ning’s words, everyone was surprised. How did she know that Kane Thomas had problems with his cardiovascular and cerebral blood vessels? The most important thing was that he was already cured.

“W-What did you say? I’m cured?” Kane Thomas asked excitedly, which verified that he indeed had a cardiovascular disease.
