3012 I Agree

“But what?” Leng Yuqi asked.

“But I still wanted to make fun of you, because I hate you!” Leng Xiaoyao said, then she put on a bad smile. The next second, she started the yacht and swayed its tail, sending a stream of seawater at them again.

Chu Jianan and Leng Yuqi were hit by the water again, and their yacht heavily shook for a while. They were extremely mad since they almost got thrown into the sea.

“Leng Xiaoyao, how dare you!” Chu Jianan angrily shouted. He couldn’t wait to tear Leng Xiaoyao to pieces, but he didn’t have that ability.

“So what?” Leng Xiaoyao replied. She sounded very pleased, which filled Chu Jianan and Leng Yuqi with fury.

“Leng Xiaoyao, you should stop!” Leng Yuqi criticized, feeling like crying.

“What can you do then?” Leng Xiaoyao said. Without delay, she did the same thing once more and another stream of sea water hit them.

This time, the sea water was too much and directly turned their yacht upside down. As a result, Leng Yuqi and Chu Jianan fell into the sea.

Luckily, they were wearing life jackets, so they were safe even though they fell into the sea.

“Oh, you fell down! How weak you are!” Leng Xiaoyao laughed at them, while Leng Yuqi and Chu Jianan were furious.

The three men who were focusing on Leng Xiaoyao watched everything clearly, and were shocked by her behavior.

“She’s really bold! Isn’t she afraid they’ll die?”

“They’re wearing life jackets. Nothing will happen. I’m just curious about the reason why she did that.”

“She must have a grudge against them. Otherwise she wouldn’t have made things difficult for them.”

“Is the man her boyfriend?”

“I agree. If so, they deserve it.”

“But it’s amazing when she swayed the tail of the yacht.”

“Right, she’s very skilled.”

“…”

Chu Jianan and Leng Yuqi didn’t stabilize themselves until they struggled several times. They were wearing life jackets, so they wouldn’t sink, but they were still frightened after falling into the ocean.

“No!” Leng Yuqi burst into tears in horror. She couldn’t care less about her image right now. After all, she was only a 17-year-old girl, so she couldn’t bear so much stress.

Leng Yuqi looked pitiful, but Leng Xiaoyao had no sympathy for her.

Chu Jianan wanted to sympathize with her, but he was in no mood right now. Glaring at Leng Xiaoyao, he was full of hatred.

Standing on her yacht, Leng Xiaoyao looked down her nose at them in the water. She had no intention of helping them and even laughed at them. “Look at you now. A couple in the water. You’re indeed a perfect match!”

“Leng Xiaoyao!”

Being humiliated by Leng Xiaoyao, both Leng Yuqi and Chu Jianan were mad, but they couldn’t argue against her.

“What?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Leng Xiaoyao, I promise I’ll get you back!” Chu Jianan threatened.

“Great, but don’t keep me waiting. Do keep your word! I’ll disdain you if you don’t do what you just said.” Leng Xiaoyao provoked him.

Chu Jianan was truck dumb, and didn’t know what to say.

He dared to do that, but there was a price. If he was going to pay Leng Xiaoyao back, he must be careful and couldn’t let her get anything on him, otherwise he would be in trouble.

After Chu Jianan and Leng Yuqi fell into the water, the staff soon saw them and swam towards them at once.

However, they didn’t see how Chu Jianan and Leng Yuqi fell into the water.

Seeing them coming over, Leng Xiaoyao immediately drove away. She only wanted to make fun of Chu Jianan and Leng Yuqi, and she wouldn’t kill them, so there was no need for her to stop the staff from rescuing them.

However, before she left, Leng Xiaoyao scared them. “Chu Jianan, Leng Yuqi, it’s just the beginning. Be prepared to face what will happen to you. Enjoy!”

Once she finished, Leng Xiaoyao was gone, but Chu Jianan and Leng Yuqi trembled in horror and anger.

It was true that they were scared of Leng Xiaoyao right now, because she suddenly became strong. She sprayed seawater at them and even made them fall into the sea. There was nothing she didn’t dare to do!

If they didn’t want to be hurt by Leng Xiaoyao again, they had to do something before she did.

However, Chu Jianan wouldn’t do that right away. He still wanted to see the result of Fang Haoming scheming against Leng Xiaoyao.

If Fang Haoming succeeded, he wouldn’t need to do anything, in case he was exposed.

If Fang Haoming failed, he needed to see the price of paying Leng Xiaoyao back.

After Leng Xiaoyao was far away, the three men surrounded her and asked curiously, “Hey, why did you do that? Do you have a grudge against them? Or is the man your boyfriend?”

“I have a grudge against them.” Leng Xiaoyao answered.

“Anyway, I have to say the way you swayed the tail of the yacht is really amazing! It’s perfect.” The man complimented.

“I know.” Leng Xiaoyao replied. She didn’t bother to be modest, which surprised the three men, but they somehow had a good impression of her.

“Enjoy yourselves. I need to go now,” Leng Xiaoyao said, then she ignored them and quickly sailed away.

Nevertheless, the three men weren’t displeased. They only felt that skilled people all had a personality quirk.

Leng Xiaoyao directly returned to the shore and gave the yacht back. It was enough that she had sailed for two hours.

After that, she decided to try bungee jumping, but her phone rang suddenly and the caller was Leng Yecheng.

“What’s up, uncle?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Yaoyao, the stock you told me to buy is losing value,” Leng Yecheng said. He was a little impatient.

Although Leng Xiaoyao had told him to listen to her, he was anxious when the stock was declining. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“It’s fine. There is no need to pay attention to that. Just hold it for a while longer,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Fine!” Leng Yecheng sighed.

...

Right when Leng Yecheng was about to hang up, a boom suddenly sounded, followed by sounds of broken glasses and Leng Yecheng’s moan of pain.

Leng Xiaoyao was immediately scared. It was obviously a car accident! She wondered whether Leng Yecheng was injured.
