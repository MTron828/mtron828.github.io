“Me too. I live in City F. How about you? Are you going to visit City F, or do you live in there too?” Chu Xuanfeng asked.

“I live in City F too,” Gu Ning said.

After a short time of chatting, they went abroad. Chu Xuanfeng didn’t sit with Gu Ning, but they met each other again when they got off the plane.

“Where are you going? May I give you a lift?” Chu Xuanfeng asked politely. He didn’t want to burden Gu Ning, so he added, “My sister is here to pick me up.”

“Thanks, but I can go back myself,” Gu Ning declined.

Chu Xuanfeng didn’t insist. They weren’t familiar after all. It would be inappropriate if he insisted.

When they were at the exit, both Gu Ning’s and Chu Xuanfeng’s sight fell on the same person at the same time. The person saw them with surprise as well.

Chu Peihan, why was she here? Gu Ning was confused.

Chu Peihan ran over at once. She grabbed Gu Ning’s hand, asking in excitement, “Boss, how come you arrived with my older brother?”

“You older brother?” Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second. She looked to Chu Xuanfeng, and was totally shocked. Chu Xuanfeng was Chu Peihan’s older brother? What a coincidence!

Chu Xuanfeng was also astonished. Gu Ning knew his younger sister? Wait, boss? Why did Peihan call Gu Ning boss? What was going on?

Although he didn’t know the details, he could guess the reason. If he guessed correctly, Chu Peihan must admire Gu Ning’s outstanding ability, so she called her boss.

Chu Xuanfeng indeed knew his younger sister well. She was so keen on kung fu.

“Well, are you...” Chu Peihan suddenly said meaningfully.

Seeing that, Gu Ning immediately knew what Chu Peihan was thinking. She interrupted her, and explained simply about how she met Chu Xuanfeng.

However, she didn’t tell Chu Xuanfeng the details about what had happened at the Huangdeng Hotel. She only said that she had rescued a person, and that Chu Xuanfeng had accidentally seen it.

They had met and chatted in the airport, and it had been a coincidence that they had met again and came out of the exit together.

“Fine.” Actually, Chu Peihan was simply joking. Although she did hope that her older brother could have a romantic relationship with Gu Ning, she wasn’t able to force them to do so. Thus she said, “It’s not early now. Why don’t you go dine with us?”

Chu Peihan sincerely invited Gu Ning. There was no need for them to pretend.

“Sorry, I told my mom that I’m going home to have a meal. I can’t let her down,” Gu Ning declined again.

“Alright.” Chu Peihan didn’t insist either. She only asked, “Where do you live then? Let us give you a ride.”

“Fenghua Luxury Mansion.” This time, Gu Ning didn’t say no. She knew that she could be real with Chu Peihan.

“We’re going in the same direction. Let’s go!” Chu Xuanfeng walked ahead with Gu Ning, ignoring Chu Xuanfeng completely.

Chu Xuanfeng felt slightly hurt. Wasn’t his younger sister here for him? Wasn’t she supposed to give him a hug? Wasn’t she supposed to care about him? Why did she suddenly forget her older brother because of Gu Ning?

Chu Xuanfeng took out his phone, taking a photo of Chu Peihan and Gu Ning. He typed down lines of words, then posted it in his moments.

Aren’t you supposed to pick up your older brother? Why do you completely ignore your own older brother the minute you see your friend? [Cry emoji]

Before long, Situ Ye saw this moment. He also immediately recognized one of the backs was Gu Ning. He squinted.

Unexpectedly, Gu Ning was Chu Peihan’s friend. That would make it much easier.

On the way, Chu Peihan kept talking with Gu Ning. Chu Xuanfeng didn’t have chance to be involved at all. He wasn’t happy, but remained quiet. He was a gentleman, and wasn’t willing to interrupt them. He wanted to leave a good impression on Gu Ning too.

Gu Ning said good-bye to them and got off the car when they arrived at Fenghua Luxury Mansion.

After Gu Ning was gone, there were only a driver, Chu Xuanfeng and his younger sister in the car. Chu Xuanfeng asked, “Han, I’ve never seen you being so close to another person. And you even call her your boss.”

“Ningning is so good! She can easily defeat me within 10 moves,” Chu Peihan said with pure admiration and respect towards Gu Ning.

Chu Xuanfeng agreed. Even he admired Gu Ning’s extraordinary ability, let alone Chu Peihan.

He was also sure that Gu Ning must not have used her full force. Otherwise, Chu Peihan would have lost within three movements.

“Oh, why don’t you have a try with Ningning someday? I’m curious to see who is going to win. I said that to Ningning the other day, and she agreed,” Chu Peihan said with great anticipation. She hadn’t see Gu Ning’s real power, so she was really curious about Gu Ning’s ability.

Chu Xuanfeng had seen it himself! Thus he now felt cornered. In the past, he would have agreed without hesitation, but now, he lost his confidence. However, he still wanted to have a try. After a few seconds of hesitation, he said, “Great!”

When Gu Ning finally got home, it was already 6:30 pm. Gu Man had prepared the meal and Gu Qing’s family were there too. They were waiting for her, but they all seemed displeased. Gu Ning felt that something had to be wrong. She asked with worry, “Mom, aunt, what happened?”

Gu Qing replied, “It was your eldest uncle. His proposal has been rejected by Executive Le. Thus he called to ask whether you have done something behind his back. He even criticized us for not helping him and standing in his way!”

Hearing that, Gu Ning was annoyed and felt like laughing. “That’s insane! How can I affect Executive Le’s decision? And why should I help him? I’m not as shameless as him!”

“Exactly! Never the less, he now believes that it’s your fault. I’m so mad at him.” Gu Qing even lost her appetite for dinner.

“There, there. We did nothing wrong. Just ignore them,” Gu Ning said to comfort them. Then she thought of something and said, “Oh! I’ve prepared jewelry made of jade for you all. The four of us ladies have a bracelet, a pendant and earrings, while uncle has a wide jade ring.”
