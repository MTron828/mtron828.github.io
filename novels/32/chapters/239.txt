Chapter 240: Chen Mengqi’s Scheme

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The other two men were afraid to expose themselves, so they criticized Gu Ning. “Miss, Mengqi has her own wine glass, so why do you have to force her to use another one?”

“Exactly, even though you’re Executive Le’s friend, we’ll call the security guards if you don’t stop.”

“Very well, please call the security guards right now. I think you better call the police too,” Gu Ning beamed, and didn’t seem frightened at all.

“You...”

Their faces changed again. If they call the police, they could be exposed. And now they were certain that this young girl had to know something. The question was how?

Le Zhengyu didn’t miss any detail, and he realized that they probably did something together behind his back.

“Are you going to drink it, or not?” Gu Ning stared at Chen Mengqi coldly.

Chen Mengqi was mad as well as terrified, and failed to say a word.

“You don’t want to drink it by yourself? Let me help you then.” Gu Ning sneered. Before Chen Mengqi could react, Gu Ning forced her mouth open wide and poured the drink straight down her throat.

The wine glass in Chen Mengqi’s hand smashed into pieces on the ground, but she was too terrified to care about that. However, she resisted in vain, and the drink was in her stomach now.

The rest of the people were all shocked, but it was too late to stop it.

Gu Ning let Chen Mengqi go afterwards, and the latter almost choked to death trying to get the drink out.

“You...” Chen Mengqi glared at Gu Ning, but she could do nothing now.

Within seconds, Chen Mengqi fainted falling on the sofa.

The other two men were frightened and didn’t dare to utter a word.

“Who did this?” Le Zhengyu was furious.

A man immediately explained, “Executive Le, it has nothing to do with us! It was Chen Mengqi’s idea!”

“Exactly! Chen Mengqi did it herself, and we know nothing about it at all! We just wanted to see what she was going to do, so we stayed quiet. Please forgive us!” another man begged.

Although they had cooperation with Le Zhengyu, they were barely comparable to him. If Le Zhengyu ended their deal, their company could lose a fortune.

Even Chen Mengqi’s friend claimed that it was Chen Mengqi’s own idea.

“Then you should know why she did it!” Gu Ning questioned. In fact, she already knew the answer from Chen Mengqi’s attitude towards Le Zhengyu. She liked Le Zhengyu, but Le Zhengyu loved An Qian, thus Chen Mengqi planned to drug Le Zhengyu and sleep with him.

Gu Ning was right.

“She-she liked Executive Le, but Executive Le doesn’t like her, so she planned to sleep with Executive Le and get pregnant. In that case, Executive Le would be hers,” Chen Mengqi’s female friend said.

There was dense hatred in Le Zhengyu’s eyes. He knew that Chen Mengqi liked him, but he had already told her that he loved An Qian. Chen Mengqi never mentioned it again, and he had thought that she had given up on him. However, to his astonishment, she was scheming behind his back.

If it hadn’t been for Gu Ning, he would have been trapped. If he had been trapped, he would feel disgusted and An Qian probably wouldn’t give him any hope.

Thinking of that, Le Zhengyu was increasingly mad. His cold sight like sharp knife glanced over the two men. “Since she wants a man, then you two have to keep her company tonight. If you dare to disobey my order, I’ll end the deal with your company at once.”

Le Zhengyu wasn’t weak. Whoever tried to trap him, he would pay the person back and it didn’t matter if he or she succeeded or not.

Although it was Chen Mengqi who had put the drug into his drink, the two men hid the truth, which made them accomplices, so Leng Shaoting naturally wouldn’t let them get away with it.

The two men were terrified, and answered immediately, “Yes, sir.”

They didn’t dare to resist at all now, unless they wanted to lose their jobs. Besides, men seldom refused to sleep with a beautiful woman, especially those two. Chen Mengqi was pretty and sexy. They had wanted her for a long time, but Chen Mengqi disliked them. In addition, Chen Mengqi was from a rich family, so they didn’t dare to use force.

Since Le Zhengyu ordered them to do so now, they were more than willing to do it.

After that, Le Zhengyu left with Gu Ning.

“Miss Gu, thank you so much for helping me. Otherwise, I could have been trapped already, but could you please tell me how you found out? I just left for a minute,” Le Zhengyu said to Gu Ning.

Gu Ning replied, “I was sitting in the private room right across from yours, and I accidentally saw you sitting with Chen Mengqi, so I was curious. I met Chen Mengqi in a shopping mall with An Qian last week, and I know about your relationship. Thus I wondered why you two were together. Unexpectedly, when you went out, she immediately put white powder into your wine glass. Although I wasn’t sure what it was, it would be a bad thing if you were drugged. Therefore, I ran to you without delay. Luckily, I arrived on time.”

Thinking of what had just happened, Le Zhengyu still felt mad, but he was surprised by Gu Ning’s good sight. “You could see me from the other side? You sight is so unbelievable!”

There was a distance of 10 meters at least between the two rooms.

“Yeah, my sight is much better than that of a normal person’s,” Gu Ning laughed. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Oh, you must be here with your friends, right?” Le Zhengyu asked.

“Yes, do you want to come and join us? An Yi is with us too,” Gu Ning invited.

An Yi and An Qian were cousins, so Le Zhengyu was familiar with him.

“No, thanks. I’m not in the mood now,” Le Zhengyu declined.

“Well, it’s fine,” Gu Ning didn’t insist.

“And, please don’t tell An Qian about this. I don’t want to worry her,” Le Zhengyu said.

“Sure,” Gu Ning replied.

After that, Le Zhengyu left and Gu Ning went back to her private room.

Gu Ning continued to play with her friends, and Leng Shaoting had been focusing on her all the time, so he didn’t ask anything.

Le Zhengyu went downstairs to the counter. He planned to order something for Gu Ning, but found out that Gu Ning had won the top prize and had free food as well as drinks tonight.
