Chapter 1704: My Period Is Coming

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Jing Yunyao wasn’t surprised because Gu Ning already told her.

After chatting for a while, the dishes were all placed on the table, and they began to enjoy the meal.

They had a rest for a while when they finished lunch before they went to the palace again. Jing Yunyao still sat in Leng Shaoting’s car, and Gu Ning drove her friends there.

This time, Leng Shaoting went to buy tickets before they entered the palace.

Jing Yunyao came to the palace for the purpose of going to the museum. Gu Ning and her friends had already looked around in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, and their next stop was also the museum, so they didn’t stop at the Hall of Supreme Harmony and went straight through it to the museum.

On their way, Jing Yunyao told Gu Ning what had happened to her when she and Leng Shaoting visited Leng Yuanhan’s grave, so she would go straight to her destination later and wouldn’t go slowly around with them.

Because the museum was very large, and there were many areas and compartments. One dynasty was in one area, and not everything was displayed in a big hall.

Although Jing Yunyao was accompanied by Leng Shaoting, she was in a special situation, so Gu Ning wouldn’t leave her alone. Therefore, Gu Ning told Chu Peihan and her other friends to look around on their own and that she would go to see other things with Jing Yunyao.

As for what they would see, Gu Ning didn’t tell them many details, and her friends were smart and didn’t ask further about it.

Gu Ning had come to this museum in her previous incarnation, so she knew that there were many antiques. Compared with the antiques in this museum, those in her telepathic eye space weren’t worth mentioning!

Anyway, most of the cultural relics left by the palace were kept here, and since ancient times the richest were the people in the palace.

There was wine vessel three generations old, ancient jade articles, famous calligraphy paintings of the Tang, Song, Yuan and Ming Dynasties, Song and Yuan ceramics, enamel, lacquerware, gold and silverware, bamboo and wood tooth combs, gold and bronze religious statues, and many emperors’ as well as concubines’ costumes, clothing and furniture, and so forth.

All kinds of valuable objects were gathered here. In addition, there were a large amount of books, classics, and document files. For this reason, the Palace Museum had an antiquities museum, a library, and a documentary hall, which organized manpower to continue to organize the cultural relics.

Actually, there was also something priceless in Gu Ning’s telepathic eye space. That set of bronze chimes was worth several billion yuan, and it would be one of the most valuable objects in the museum too.

If Gu Ning showed the set of bronze chimes to the public, it would cause a great sensation in the field of music and antiques. All major music groups and major museums would definitely compete against each other for it.

Thinking of that, Gu Ning thought that she should probably sell the set of bronze chimes. At that time, Gu Ning could advertise her Xiangyun Antique-store.

She didn’t have the interest in collecting antiques and she was involved in this industry simply because she had a pair of Jade Eyes, and she was able to find valuable objects with them. After she found valuable ancient objects, she needed to sell them for money. All in all, money was more important than ancient objects in Gu Ning’s eyes.

Unfortunately, she couldn’t sell a lot of antiques at a time, or she would get in trouble, so she could only keep them in her telepathic eye space and sell them at her antique store bit by bit.

Gu Ning didn’t realize that she hadn’t delivered goods to Xiangyun Antique-store for a long time until now.

Although they couldn’t sell antiques every day, and a dozen antiques could satisfy the customers’ needs for a while, the antiques left on the shelves for days were unpopular, which meant that they should replace them with new ones to attract more customers.

Gu Ning decided to go to Xiangyun Antique-store when she was free in a few days. As for the set of bronze chimes, she would launch a publicity campaign once there was a large auction.

As Gu Ning walked near the museum, she felt magical power, and she felt uncomfortable when it intruded into her body after she entered the museum. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Gu Ning frowned with confusion. Was it because the magical power was too strong and she couldn’t accept it all of a sudden?

Gu Ning tried to absorb the magical power, but she didn’t want to expose more of herself in front of Jing Yunyao, because she had already exposed a lot about her in front of Jing Yunyao. If only Leng Shaoting was by her side, she wouldn’t be worried, because Leng Shaoting was aware of her Jade Eyes.

Even though she felt a little uncomfortable, it was still tolerable, so she put it aside and went where Yunyao wanted to go.

Because Jing Yunyao got some of her memories back, this museum wasn’t strange to her, so she brought Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning to the calligraphy and painting exhibition area.

Jing Yunyao directly went to the front of Along the River During the Qingming Festival and asked, “Has it been stolen once 27 years ago?”

“Right, it was indeed stolen 27 years ago, and was brought back afterwards,” said Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting was aware of it, but he didn’t know who had brought it back. He didn’t care much about it, and it happened before he was born.

“In my memories, I came here for this painting. It was stolen and replaced, but I failed to remember what happened next,” said Jing Yunyao. Even though she was looking at it right now, she couldn’t remember anything else.

“Ningning, are you alright? Your face looks pale. Do you feel uncomfortable?” At this time, Leng Shaoting gave Gu Ning a glance and saw her pale face.

Hearing that, Jing Yunyao turned to look at Gu Ning at once. Seeing her pale face, Jing Yunyao looked worried too.

“Do I?” Gu Ning was surprised. “I don’t feel uncomfortable at all.”

Saying that, Gu Ning pretended to be fine, but she clearly knew that she wasn’t. She was indeed uncomfortable ever since she entered here. When the magical power kept attacking her, she felt quite stressed.

“Really?” Leng Shaoting frowned with concern.

Gu Ning showed embarrassment at once. “Um, my stomach is a little painful, but it isn’t serious. Maybe my period is coming. Why don’t you go on looking around here, and I’ll go to the ladies’ room? I’ll call you later.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao nodded. Different girls had different reactions when their period came.

Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao didn’t doubt Gu Ning’s words and agreed, then Gu Ning left for the ladies’ room. However, once she walked out of the room, she showed great pain on her face.
