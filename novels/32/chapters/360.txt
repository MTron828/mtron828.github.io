Chapter 361 Do You Want to Fight?

However, before they could realize what happened, Chu Peihan said angrily, “Do you want to grab the house from Mixi’s family? Impossible!”

“Peihan, Hao Ran, Zixun, Tianping!” Yu Mixi abruptly stood up with excitement, as if she saw her lifesavers. Yu Mixi’s parents also relaxed seeing that Chu Peihan and the others came.

Although they weren’t clear about their family background, they knew that all of them were from either rich or powerful families. Their arrival made Yu Mixi’s family feel safe.

However, Yu Mixi’s oldest uncle and aunt had the opposite idea. In their eyes, Chu Peihan and the others were merely a bunch of students. Yu Mixi’s aunt snapped at them, “It’s our family affairs, and it’s none of your business!”

“It is our business, and we will support Mixi!” Hao Ran said affirmatively.

“You...” Yu Mixi’s aunt as annoyed.

“You’re just a bunch of kids!” Yu Mixi’s oldest uncle said with disdain.

“So what? I think that you better leave now, and disappear forever. Otherwise, you can’t bear the result!” Qin Zixun threatened.

“That’s interesting! Who do you think you are to threaten us?” a woman who stood beside Yu Mixi’s oldest uncle said with disdain. She was Yu Mixi’s oldest aunt.

“We’re enough to make you pay for what you’ve done,” a cold female voice suddenly sounded from outside. And Gu Ning walked in their sight.

“Boss!” Hao Ran and the others called her.

“Ningning!” Yu Mixi immediately ran to Gu Ning, and felt like crying.

“It’s fine. I’ll handle it,” Gu Ning comforted her and held her hand, stepping towards them.

Seeing that it was another young girl, Yu Mixi’s uncles and aunt didn’t care about her either.

Gu Ning just gave them a cold glance before her sight fell on Yu Mixi’s father. “Uncle Yu, may I know what the demolition compensation for your house is?”

Yu Mixi’s father respected Gu Ning, so he was willing to tell her the truth no matter what her aim was. “Our house is only 70 square meters in size, so we can get seven hundred thousand yuan for it. And we can then use the money to buy a bigger house.”

Hearing that the house was worth seven hundred thousand yuan, Yu Mixi’s uncles and aunts couldn’t wait to have the money in their pockets. Their greedy expressions were really disgusting.

“When is the house going to be demolished?” Gu Ning asked.

“We’ll finish the procedure after the New Year festival, and we then need to move out within two months,” Yu Mixi’s father answered.

“Great, why don’t you sell this house to me, and I’ll give you a simply-decorated house which is 120 square meters in size in Jiahua Garden? Jiahua Garden is a living area being constructed by Shenghua Real Estate,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, everyone was astonished. Jiahua Garden was a medium-high level living area. And a 120 square-meters house was worth at least two million yuan. Gu Ning must be insane to exchange a much cheaper house with an expensive one!

Yu Mixi’s uncles and aunts were jealous of Yu Mixi’s father now. They all wished that they could live in such a great house.

In fact, Gu Ning had always wanted to help Yu Mixi’s family, but she knew that they wouldn’t accept it because it felt like alms. And Gu Ning didn’t want to hurt their feelings, but now it was different. Yu Mixi’s family was in trouble now and it was a perfect time for her to help Yu Mixi. Although there were many vacant houses from Shenghua Real Estate, they were all ordinary living areas. And Gu Ning decided to give them a better one.

“Miss Gu, I don’t think that it’s a good idea. My house is only worth seven hundred thousand yuan, but the houses in Jiahua Garden are worth at least two million yuan!” Yu Mixi’s father declined. He wasn’t a man who would take advantage of others, and Gu Ning had already helped them a lot.

“Exactly, Miss Gu!” Yu Mixi’s mother echoed.

Yu Mixi’s uncles and aunt were irritated by Yu Mixi’s parents. They were more than willing to accept the house in Jiahua Garden.

“Don’t forget that Mixi is going to work for me in the future. I’m Mixi’s boss. Please just take this as her advanced bonus,” Gu Ning said to calm their anxiety.

Yu Mixi’s parents were aware of that, but Chu Peihan and others didn’t know that, so they were all surprised, looking to Gu Ning puzzled. However, it wasn’t the right time for them to ask the question.

“Well.” Yu Mixi’s father still thought that they shouldn’t accept it.

“Don’t worry. We’re all Mixi’s good friends, and friends always help each other. Mixi will work for me in the future and she’ll get housing benefits after all. Please just take it as the advance. It’s the same!” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Yu Mixi’s parents changed their mind. They knew that Gu Ning was persuading them to accept her kindness without feeling guilty, but if they didn’t solve the problem, their shameless relatives would keep annoying them, and they were unwilling to argue with them all the time.

“Wait, even if you sell this house to her, we still can share the new house with you!” Yu Mixi’s aunt argued. It seemed like they wouldn’t leave just because Yu Mixi’s father sold the house.

“Exactly!” Yu Mixi’s oldest uncle echoed.

“You’re indeed crazy people,” Gu Ning sneered. She looked at them coldly, which threatened them and made them feel greatly stressed. Even so, Yu Mixi’s oldest uncle still retorted, “The house is our father’s property, so of course we should share it together!”

“Is you name on the Premises Permit?” Gu Ning asked.

Yu Mixi’s oldest uncle panicked but still argued, “No, but it doesn’t matter! I still can share the house!”

Everyone was amused by his reply. Chu Peihan even swore at him, “What the f*ck! I’ve never seen such a shameless person before! I really want to punch you!” Chu Peihan rolled up her sleeves. It seemed like she was going to fight with them.

“I had the same idea!” Hao Ran agreed with Chu Peihan.

Right at this moment, An Yi and Mu Ke arrived. They knew Yu Mixi’s parents too and were also willing to help. However, Yu Mixi’s uncles and aunt were slightly scared. If they were really going to fight, it was possible that they would lose because there were only four of them. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Sorry we’re late. Are we going to fight?” Mu Ke asked and rolled his sleeves up.
