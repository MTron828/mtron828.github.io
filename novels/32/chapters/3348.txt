“Miss Leng…” When the woman who was chatting happily with Leng Yecheng saw Leng Xiaoyao, she was very surprised and stood up directly.

Everyone was surprised to see that the woman actually knew Leng Xiaoyao.

Leng Xiaoyao smiled and walked towards the woman, greeting her very friendly. “Miss Dai, long time no see.”

This woman was Dai Ya.

“You know each other?” Ling Tianqi was very surprised.

“We met before. And we’ve been through some things together!” Dai Ya said, but she couldn’t go into detail about what happened. “I was planning to contact you tomorrow! I didn’t expect to meet you today. It’s such a coincidence.”

Seeing Leng Xiaoyao, Dai Ya was also very happy. Although they had only met once, Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities had impressed her. She was looking forward to getting to know her better.

Although she had Leng Xiaoyao’s phone number, they had only met once, so she didn’t dare to contact her. Plus, Leng Xiaoyao hadn’t contacted her either, so she didn’t think too much about it.

This time she came to City Chang. She wanted to contact Leng Xiaoyao, but she had just arrived today and didn’t have time. She had planned to contact her when she had free time tomorrow, but she didn’t expect to meet her today.

Leng Xiaoyao smiled, then looked at Leng Yecheng. “Uncle Yecheng.”

“Hi!” Leng Yecheng was a little uneasy. He didn’t know if Leng Xiaoyao would misunderstand it since he and Dai Ya were so close just now.

“You…” Dai Ya looked at Leng Xiaoyao in surprise, then at Leng Yecheng. She didn’t expect them to be related. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“He’s my uncle, by blood,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“I see. By the way, let me introduce you. This is my brother, Dai Zhenjie.” Dai Ya introduced a young man next to her to Leng Xiaoyao.

“Miss Leng, nice to meet you. I’ve heard about you from Dai Ya.” Dai Zhenjie took the initiative to greet Leng Xiaoyao. After hearing about them from Dai Ya, he was very curious about Leng Xiaoyao.

Dai Ya had only mentioned that they had found ginseng in the mountains. She didn’t say anything that shouldn’t be said.

“Nice to meet you too, Mr. Dai,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Dai Ya immediately leaned over to Leng Xiaoyao’s ears and whispered, “Don’t worry, I didn’t say anything I shouldn’t have said. I only mentioned that we found reishi mushrooms together in the mountains.”

Since they said not to tell anyone back then, she naturally wouldn’t say it aloud, but as for whether Lin Musi said anything about it, she didn’t know and couldn’t guarantee it. After all, she couldn’t control her. It depended on Lin Musi’s own will.

Leng Xiaoyao smiled at her and believed her. “By the way, these two are my good friends. This is Ling Tianqi’s niece, Xiong Manxin, and this is An Chenmeng.”

“Nice to meet you.” Dai Ya greeted them.

“Nice to meet you too.” They replied.

After Leng Xiaoyao greeted An Chenjun and Pei Heran, they sat down.

“Last time I heard that you are very good at car racing. Do you often come to this circuit? Have you seen the race in the video with your own eyes,” Daya asked.

“Yeah!” Leng Xiaoyao smiled and said honestly, “Actually, that’s me and Mr. Li.”

“What?”

Several surprised voices sounded.

They were Dai Ya, Dai Zhenjie, and Leng Yecheng.

“That’s you and Mr. Li?” Dai Ya and Leng Yecheng asked with one accord.

At the same time, Dai Ya looked at Leng Yecheng in surprise. He didn’t even know.

“Yeah.” Leng Xiaoyao answered with a nod.

“When did you learn to race cars? How come I don’t know?” Leng Yecheng asked. Racing wasn’t just driving normally. It was basically playing with your life!

He had seen this video before. It was extremely thrilling, but he didn’t know that it was Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen.

Leng Yecheng felt so aggrieved. As Leng Xiaoyao’s uncle, he didn’t know that she had such an unbelievable skill.

In fact, there were many things about Leng Xiaoyao that he didn’t know about. She was good at gambling, stocks, hacking, and even suddenly became a top student.

Thinking of these things, Leng Yecheng felt even more aggrieved. However, he wasn’t that surprised about Leng Xiaoyao’s ability to race cars.

“If you knew, you probably wouldn’t even let me touch it,” Leng Xiaoyao said weakly.

In fact, in the incarnation before her previous incarnation, she really couldn’t drive. She learned how to drive in her previous incarnation, but she couldn’t tell Leng Yecheng about it, so she could only say that.

“I…” For a moment, Leng Yecheng didn’t know what to say. If he had known, he would never have let Leng Xiaoyao touch it! It was too dangerous.

However, it was too late.

In the end, Leng Yecheng could only sigh and say, “What should I do with you!”

“You’re even more amazing than I imagined!” Dai Ya said. She knew that Leng Xiaoyao was powerful, but she had never seen it with her own eyes before. She never thought the person in the video would be Leng Xiaoyao. Even though Leng Xiaoyao was powerful, Dai Ya didn’t think that she was as powerful as the two in the video!

“Thank you,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Xiaoyao, what do you girls want to drink?” Ling Tianqi asked.

“Wine, please,” said Leng Xiaoyao.

Leng Yecheng was displeased. “Give her juice!”

Then he said to Leng Xiaoyao, “You’re too young to drink!”

“I’m no longer a kid. We’ve already finished the National College Entrance Examination. Please let me have some!” Leng Xiaoyao pouted.

In the end, Leng Yecheng gave in and agreed, but he wouldn’t let her drink too much.

Leng Xiaoyao was allowed to drink red wine, so An Chenmeng and Xiong Manxin naturally followed suit.

At that moment, Dai Ya looked at Leng Xiaoyao with mixed emotions.

When they were in City Qin, Leng Xiaoyao was mature and steady, like an experienced person. However, at this moment, she was like a little girl. She really didn’t know which one was the real her!

No matter which one was the real her, they communicated effortlessly even though they were many years apart in age.

Leng Xiaoyao chatted with Dai Ya, but she didn’t ignore An Chenmeng and Xiong Manxin. Besides, except for the Dai siblings, they all knew each other, so there was no awkwardness.

They didn’t come here just for the competition, but to talk business.

There was a piece of land in the western suburbs that was very good, with over two hundred acres. It wasn’t too big or small, and its location was very good.

Nowadays, the suburbs were constantly developing and expanding. This piece of land was in a good location and wasn’t too remote.

The original owner of this land couldn’t get a loan for some reason and couldn’t build a house. If the house wasn’t built, the property rights would decrease over time, so he wanted to sell the land.

After Ling Tianqi found out about it, he became interested.

Although he wasn’t very refined, he had ambition and ability. It was just that his family couldn’t come up with so much money for his investment at once, so Ling Tianqi wanted to cooperate with other people.
