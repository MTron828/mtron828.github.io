Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“What? Shaoting is already in the period of turning qi into energy?” Jing Yunyao was shocked.

It was too unbelievable to be true in her eyes. Even those so-called talented cultivators in the cultivation world couldn’t go up in three levels at a time.

To her surprise, Leng Shaoting was able to do that within a short time. At the same time, Jing Yunyao felt proud of him too. Since Leng Shaoting was a cultivator now, there would be a lot of trouble ahead of him.

“Yes,” Gu Ning said.

Jing Yunyao didn’t know what to say all of a sudden, and Gu Ning gave her some time to absorb the shocking information.

After a long while, Jing Yunyao asked, “Oh, how did Shaoting become a cultivator?”

“Shaoting was searching for a night-luminescent pearl and suddenly found he was able to absorb its magical power once he held it in his hands. Maybe because he absorbed more and more magical power over time, his body started to change and the magical power began to circulate in it, then he became a cultivator,” said Gu Ning. Actually, Leng Shaoting had absorbed more magical power from her body, but it was a secret that she would never tell.

Jing Yunyao nodded, because different people had different chances to become a cultivator.

“Mother, can you move into Shaoting’s house?” asked Gu Ning.

“Will it be inconvenient for you?” asked Jing Yunyao, because Leng Shaoting didn’t meet her yet. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Of course not!” said Gu Ning.

“Great!” Jing Yunyao smiled, then Gu Ning drove her to Leng Shaoting’s house.

“Mother, may I know which period you’re in right now?” asked Gu Ning.

“I’m in the advanced stage of turning qi into energy, but I’ve stopped in that stage for years,” said Jing Yunyao. Although she had left the cultivation world for years, she didn’t stop practicing her cultivation. Because the man who wanted to kill her was at a very high level, she had to improve herself.

As long as she could reach the period from concrete to abstract, she would have help and support from Tiandaozong.

Tiandaozong held an even higher position than the four dominant families, so she would be safe then. However, there was also a condition that she couldn’t have made unacceptable mistakes before so that Tiandaozong would accept her.

If a senior cultivator made an unacceptable mistake, Tiandaozong wouldn’t kill them, but they would seriously punish them.

Although Jing Yunyao believed that the Jing family wanted to murder her, she didn’t have the ability to fight against it now. She had to continue to improve herself in order to successfully take revenge.

Even if she was going to die, she would die for a reason. Especially after she found out that she had a son now, she had to be very careful and wouldn’t take action until she was fully-prepared.

“Don’t worry, I definitely won’t take action alone,” said Jing Yunyao.

“Great.” Gu Ning felt relieved.

“Oh, you just told me that Shaoting has an experienced private teacher. Who is he? Does he know my relationship with Shaoting?” asked Jing Yunyao.

“Um, he’s a senior cultivator too, but he isn’t a member of the cultivation world, so he doesn’t know your relationship with Shaoting. He’s a senior member of the Kunlun Sect, and his name is Shangguan Yang,” said Gu Ning.

“Shangguan Yang!” Jing Yunyao was shocked.

“Mother, do you know Shangguan Yang?” asked Gu Ning.

“Yes, I heard a little about him, but we’ve never met before,” said Jing Yunyao. “The Kunlun Sect used to be the leading orthodox sect among different sects when the cultivation world wasn’t separated from other worlds, and Shangguan Yang was a rare senior cultivator. As modern society came into being, there were fewer and fewer cultivators because magical power was harder and harder to be found. The heavenly tribulation was more and more difficult, so cultivators gathered together in order to survive. Because there is endless magical power in Qianling Mountain, the cultivation world is set there, but it is only as large as a city with a few thousand people.”

“Over the past hundreds of years, we didn’t see any other cultivators in the mortals’ world, so we thought cultivators only existed in the cultivation world. To my surprise, Shangguan Yang is still alive!” said Jing Yunyao.

“Grandpa Shangguan lived in the tower the entire time, and we drew his attention with delicious food. I persuaded him to take Shaoting as his student, so he came back to the capital with us,” said Gu Ning.

“There is indeed more magical power in Kunlun Mountain than other places, but I’ve never been to the Kunlun Sect’s place before,” said Jing Yunyao. “I’m really surprised to know that Shangguan Yang is still alive.”
