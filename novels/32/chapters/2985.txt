2988 Give You an Answer Tomorrow Morning

Leng Yuqi was irritated, but she could do nothing about it. If she regretted it now, she would be humiliated.

However, if the result was out and Leng Xiaoyao indeed surpassed her, she would still be extremely embarrassed.

Seeing Leng Xiaoyao being so calm, while Leng Yuqi being so anxious, the chauffeur, Uncle Liu, asked Leng Xiaoyao, “Xiaoyao, why are you so confident all of a sudden? Did you become excellent at studying?”

Leng Xiaoyao understood that Uncle Liu disliked her, but had no bad intention, so she answered with a good attitude. “Yeah, after I ended the engagement, I suddenly found that I’m actually talented at studying. I realized that my future was being damaged by a bad guy. After I dumped him, I became clear-headed.”

Although Uncle Liu disliked Leng Xiaoyao, he disapproved of Chu Jianan’s behavior as well. Therefore, he had a bad impression of Leng Yuqi.

She was obedient and was academically inclined, but she tried to steal her cousin’s fiancé.

On the contrary, Leng Xiaoyao was much lovelier now.

When Leng Xiaoyao disdained Chu Jianan, Leng Yuqi was mad, but couldn’t defend him.

Back at home, Song Meiyu asked Leng Yuqi, “Qiqi, how was the monthly test?”

Song Meiyu asked her in front of everyone on purpose, because Leng Yuqi was always better than Leng Xiaoyao at studying. She deliberately tried to put pressure on Leng Xiaoyao.

...

However, this time, Leng Yuqi didn’t tell her that she had done well with confidence. Instead, Leng Yuqi looked upset.

“I don’t think I’ve done my best,” Leng Yuqi said. She made up an excuse to defend herself. If Leng Xiaoyao really surpassed her, she could say that she didn’t do her best in the test.

“That’s fine. Even if you didn’t do your best, I believe you will still get a high score.” Song Meiyu comforted Leng Yuqi. She didn’t think it was a big deal because she believed it was easy for Leng Yuqi to stay among the top 50, while Leng Xiaoyao should rank hundreds of places behind Leng Yuqi.

Afterwards, Song Meiyu pretended to care about Leng Xiaoyao and asked her, “Xiaoyao, how about you?”

“Not bad!” Leng Xiaoyao answered casually.

However, no one really believed that she did well in the test. They just thought that she might have filled more blanks than before.

“The result of the test doesn’t matter. No matter how good you are at studying, you should have moral standards.” Leng Changyuan saw through Song Meiyu, so he laughed at them.

Upon hearing that, Song Meiyu and Leng Yuqi were displeased, but they said nothing because they were indeed wrong.

After that, Leng Xiaoyao chatted with Leng Changyuan about other topics, while Leng Yuqi went to review in her room.

An Chenmeng did the same thing. Once she got home, she devoted herself to reviewing.

She didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to surpass her, so she studied harder than ever.

...

…

After chatting with Leng Xiaoyao for a while, Leng Changyuan went to have a rest. Leng Xiaoyao told Leng Yecheng that she wanted to have a private talk with him in his study.

Leng Yecheng thought Leng Xiaoyao was going to talk about the company with him, so he became serious at once and took Leng Xiaoyao to his study.

In the study, Leng Yecheng spoke right away. “Yaoyao, what do you want to talk to me about?”

Seeing that Leng Yecheng was so nervous, Leng Xiaoyao comforted him. “Uncle, don’t be so nervous. It’s not a bad thing I’m going to tell you.”

Hearing that, Leng Yecheng relaxed.

“Uncle, do you speculate in stocks and shares?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Yeah, but I’m not good at it,” Leng Yecheng admitted.

“That’s not important. To be honest with you, I have decided to buy some shares. And I have the confidence to win a fortune. Since there is a good opportunity to make money, I obviously decided to share it with you. You can follow me and invest in it. When I buy in, you can buy in as well,” Leng Xiaoyao said seriously. She didn’t want Leng Yecheng to think she was joking.

Leng Yecheng didn’t think she was joking, but was extremely surprised and could barely believe his ears. “What? You want to buy shares and even have the chance to win a fortune? When did you learn to speculate in stocks and shares?”

“I can’t tell you much, but you’re my uncle. I won’t harm you,” Leng Xiaoyao said. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

...

“I know you won’t harm me, but I can’t just accept it all of a sudden,” Leng Yecheng said. He believed that Leng Xiaoyao would never harm him.

“Uncle, if you trust me, you can follow me to buy shares. Don’t ask more about it. No matter what happens in the future, don’t worry and just follow me. If you have any worries and don’t want to follow me, then forget it. After all, it requires a lot of money. After all, it’s a huge investment,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She wouldn’t explain it to him. If he trusted her, they could make money together. If Leng Yecheng had his worries, she wouldn’t force him.

Leng Yecheng was silent for a while, and didn’t give her an answer right away.

He had watched Leng Xiaoyao’s changes, and he understood that she must have confidence since she dared to say that.

Therefore, although he indeed had worries, he still wanted to try.

“Uncle, if you need time to think about it, you can do it, but please don’t waste too much time thinking about it,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She wouldn’t urge Leng Yecheng to give her an answer right now.

“Great, I’ll give you an answer tomorrow morning,” Leng Yecheng said. It wasn’t easy for him to make the decision immediately.

“Sure!” Leng Xiaoyao answered, then returned to her room.

That night, Leng Yecheng thought carefully about what Leng Xiaoyao had told him. In the end, he made up his mind to follow Leng Xiaoyao.

Therefore, after he got up the next morning, he told Leng Xiaoyao that he had decided to follow her in buying the shares.

Then Leng Xiaoyao told Leng Yecheng what shares they were going to buy.

...

Although Leng Yecheng still had his doubts, he didn’t ask further about it since Leng Xiaoyao told him not to.

“How much should I pay for it?” Leng Yecheng asked.

“About a million yuan at first. If we need to buy more, I’ll tell you at that time,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“No problem,” Leng Yecheng said. A million yuan wasn’t much, so he could accept it.
