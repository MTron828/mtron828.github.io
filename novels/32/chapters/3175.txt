3177 Feel and Guess

Afterwards, Shen Yamei’s husband called their daughter and heavily criticized her.

After Shen Yamei’s daughter heard about it, she didn’t think she was wrong at all. Instead, she was furious that they failed to harm Shen Xiyin and get her out of the designing industry.

After having the call with her father, she immediately called Shen Yamei and blamed her mother for it. She believed that it was her mother’s fault that their plan was ruined.

Shen Yamei felt extremely aggrieved. She tried to harm her niece for her daughter, but she was criticized in the end.

When Shen Yaping and the others got home, Old Mrs. Shen and Mrs. Shen noticed that they were in a bad mood. They asked them why, but nobody explained.

A while later, Shen Yaping went to the company.

After two hours, Leng Xiaoyao and the others arrived in City Li by car.

Because there would be a stone gambling event, many visitors came to City Li and they had to book rooms beforehand.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t need to worry about that. Li Mochen had already made all the arrangements once they decided to come here.

When they got to City Li, it was still early, not even 10 am yet.

“Do you need a rest first? We can go to the meeting place after lunch.” Li Mochen asked Leng Xiaoyao. It sounded casual, but he actually asked that out of concern. Normally, Li Mochen wouldn’t care so much about anyone.

“I’m not tired at all. I don’t need a rest. How about you? If you need to, you can go rest for a while. If not, we can directly go to the main venue,” Leng Xiaoyao said. As soon as they got to City Li, she couldn’t wait to go there. They only had two days, so they should leave tomorrow or the day after.

“We’re not tired,” said Mu Yiyang and the others at once.

They also wanted to see Leng Xiaoyao gamble on stones.

It was true that they couldn’t wait to see Leng Xiaoyao doing it instead of themselves.

Because they didn’t know much about stone-gambling, they simply came for fun, but Leng Xiaoyao had skills.

“Great, then let’s go to the main venue! I can’t wait to see Miss Leng gamble on stones. I’m waiting to let Miss Leng pick up some for me,” Si Yiqi said.

“Sure!” Li Mochen answered. Then they went straight to the stone-gambling main venue.

He also wanted to see Leng Xiaoyao gamble on stones, but he cared more about her condition.

Jiang Han and the others realized that Leng Xiaoyao had skills in stone-gambling. Even Si Yiqi and Mu Yiyang both hoped that she could win.

However, they just learned that Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t an ordinary person, so they weren’t surprised by her abilities.

The stone-gambling event would be held for three days. On the first day, all the businessmen gathered together at the stone-gambling street and square. They could freely choose the raw jade materials.

On the second day, there would be an auction at the auction house of the antique appraisal. All the raw jade materials on sale were checked by experts and there was a high probability to cut jade from them. There were also half-cut raw jade materials.

The number of the guests invited to the auction was limited. Normally, the host would send the invitation letter to the businessmen and some people would also get an invitation letter through connections.

The invitation letter wasn’t sent to a specific person. With an invitation letter, two people could go.

Since they all came, Mu Yiyang got four invitation letters, so there was nothing for Leng Xiaoyao to be worried about.

On the third day, they could make deals for jade. Many people would sell the jade and the most generous bidder would have it.

Today was the first day, so they were all looking at raw jade materials at the stone-gambling street and square.

There were so many raw jade materials, so Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t look at every piece within a day. She needed to touch them to see whether there was magical power.

At a glance, she could see that there were over ten thousand raw jade materials and there could be more inside. She needed to spend at least two seconds on each raw jade material, so she didn’t have much time.

As a result, Leng Xiaoyao needed good luck to cut out jade.

This time, she simply came to get familiar with this place. After the National College Entrance Examination, she would come here again to look at those raw jade materials slowly.

At the big square, the raw jade materials at the stands were at low level. It wasn’t likely to cut out jade from them. Therefore, they went directly to large stores.

In large stores, there were more raw jade materials of high quality, so it should be more possible to cut out jade.

“We can go to larger stores,” Leng Xiaoyao suggested.

“No problem, wherever you go, we’ll follow you,” Mu Yiyang said. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Because Mu Yiyang replied to Leng Xiaoyao first every time, Li Mochen felt he was a little hateful, but he had no position to say anything.

“Right, we’ll follow you,” Si Yiqi said.

The others had no disagreements, so they went to the larger stores.

“Go get two carts,” Li Mochen said to Jiang Han and Mu Fan.

“Sure.” They answered and immediately left to carry out the order.

“Wait a second.” Leng Xiaoyao shouted to them, “Three please.”

“Lin Mu, go with them,” Mu Yiyang said to his subordinate.

“Sure.” Lin Mu answered, then went with Jiang Han and Mu Fan.

A cart could accommodate many raw jade materials. Leng Xiaoyao asked for three. They didn’t doubt Leng Xiaoyao’s ability. Instead, they were looking forward to it.

There were many people in the large stores too, but they weren’t as crowded as the square.

Because they wanted to see how Leng Xiaoyao chose raw jade materials, they followed Leng Xiaoyao all the time and didn’t go to look at the raw jade materials.

“Why don’t you look around?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“We want to see how you choose raw jade materials,” Mu Yiyang said.

“I rely on my feelings by touching them,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Feelings? No way! Do you have special abilities?” Si Yiqi asked. He didn’t finish, but his meaning couldn’t be more obvious.

Leng Xiaoyao put on a mysterious smile and said nothing, which was a silent admission.

Knowing that, they all couldn’t wait to see whether Leng Xiaoyao could cut out jade from the raw jade materials she chose.

...

Leng Xiaoyao ignored them and began to feel the raw jade materials.

When other people saw that Leng Xiaoyao pressed on the raw jade materials one after another for only one or two seconds, they knew that she was using her special ability to feel them.

After dozens of raw jade materials, Leng Xiaoyao found no magical power, but it was very normal. Normally, there was only jade after cutting over a thousand raw jade materials open.

However, onlookers were surprised by Leng Xiaoyao’s way of choosing raw jade materials. She touched them quickly, but didn’t observe them carefully. It looked like she was grocery shopping. They felt that Leng Xiaoyao knew nothing about stone-gambling and simply came for fun.
