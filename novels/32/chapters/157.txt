Chapter 159 Someone Told Me He Likes Me Today

Then, they climbed up the mountain.

Their aim was to capture the spies from Country R. Although the spy hadn’t gotten anything useful, it was unacceptable that he threatened this country’s safety.

The Red Flame team wasn’t an ordinary team. They had only spent three days before they had successfully put a locator on one of the spies. They had the spies’ location, and were going to catch them all together.

It was getting darker, and it wasn’t easy to walk on the mountain road. However, for Leng Shaoting and his teammates, who were used to fulfilling their tasks in darkness, it was nothing.

They moved fast, but quietly. Their goal was getting closer and closer.

Half an hour later, Leng Shaoting and his teammates arrived at their destination. It was a cave.

They didn’t get near it right away, but hid among weeds and trees to observe the situation around it first. After making sure that there was no ambush, they gradually approached the cave.

When they were at the entrance of the cave, they heard clear voices from it. Although the dialogs were in Country R’s language, Leng Shaoting and his teammates all understood it.

They knew many languages, which was demanded qualification for any agent.

Those spies were talking casually. It seemed they had no idea that they had already been discovered, which was an advantage for Leng Shaoting and his teammates. They secretly slid in at a perfectly timed moment, and it was too late for those spies to resist when they found out that they were caught.

After a round of gunshots, it was done.

Although it wasn’t a hard task, the Red Flame treated it seriously as usual. The Red Flame was always the best choice to handle such international cases, because the Red Flame was the most trustworthy special force in this country.

The task is finished, but it’s torture for me to go back on that road.” Xu Jinchen covered his chest with a hand, like he was in pain.

“It’s not your car anyway. Do you really have to do that?” Xin Bei despised his act.

“If it were his car, he would probably be crying!” Si Ming laughed.

“Ha-ha, you’re right,” Xin Bei couldn’t agree more.

“Show me your sympathy! I hate you,” Xu Jinchen ignored them, catching up with Leng Shaoting.

“Boss, what are you gonna do next?” Xu Jinchen asked. “Do what I should do,” Leng Shaoting replied.

“Fine. You work all day, but there aren’t that many things to deal with in our team. I don’t understand why you are so busy every day?” Xu Jinchen said. “I don’t want to do that. I prefer to date girls, and find someone I like. Otherwise, my family will make the decision for me. It’s pathetic.”

Xu Jinchen’s father had called him the other day to ask whether he had a girlfriend or not. If not, his father would arrange a blind date for him. Xu Jinchen clearly knew how pathetic it would be if he had to live his life with a woman he disliked. Everyone hoped to spend the rest of their life with someone in love!

Hearing Xu Jinchen say that, an idea dawned on Leng Shaoting. He thought of Gu Ning. He didn’t exactly know his feelings towards Gu Ning. However, once he thought of Gu Ning, he felt relaxed for no reason, and also wanted to meet her right away.

In City F, after he hung up the call with Gu Ning, Qin Yifan didn’t get his mind back until a long time had passed. He called Wei Zhirui afterwards to ask him to go for a drink.

The first thought of a man, who was in a bad mood, was to drink. He wanted to relieve his pain by drinking, but only ended up feeling more miserable.

After a short time, Wei Zhirui arrived. When he saw Qin Yifan, Qin Yifan was already a little drunk.

“What happened to you?” Wei Zhirui asked with anxiety.

Qin Yifan had only told him that he was in a bad mood on the phone, but didn’t tell him the reason. Thus Wei Zhirui wasn’t clear why Qin Yifan looked so sad. Besides, he had never seen Qin Yifan being so heartbroken.

“I’ve been dumped,” Qin Yifan said.

“What? When?” Wei Zhirui was shocked. “When did you get a girlfriend? How could I know nothing about it?”

They were close friends. If Qin Yifan had a girlfriend, he would know.

“Well.” Qin Yifan gave a wry smile. “I didn’t have one! She rejected me when I told her I like her.”

Qin Yifan then told Wei Zhirui everything, including the fact that Qin Yiqing had talked to Gu Ning.

As for what Qin Yiqing had done, Wei Zhirui also

disapproved. He and Qin Yifan were close friends, but he had never had a good impression of Qin Yiqing.

It was Qin Yifan’s personal affairs after all, so Wei Zhirui could do nothing but drink with him.

Although he knew that Qin Yifan treated Gu Ning differently, he didn’t expect that Qin Yifan truly liked Gu Ning. However, Gu Ning had just turned 18 years old. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

That night, Qin Yifan was completely drunk. It was the first time he had ever been that drunk.

Leng Shaoting didn’t get back to his place until it was almost 12 pm. He turned on his phone, noticing that there was a missed call from Gu Ning. Leng Shaoting was slightly excited.

She had called him.

Then, Leng Shaoting got nervous all of a sudden, because he didn’t know why Gu Ning had called him. Had she been in trouble? If something terrible had happened to her, and she had needed his help, but he had missed her call, he would blame himself for that.

Even though it was very late, Leng Shaoting called Gu Ning back without delay.

Gu Ning was used to staying up late, so she was awake reading at that time.

Seeing Leng Shaoting’s call, Gu Ning was also excited. She even panicked a little. After breathing out a long breath, she answered the call, “Hi.”

“Did you call me for an emergency?” Leng Shaoting asked the minute he heard Gu Ning’s voice.

Although he felt concerned about Gu Ning, he remained cold as usual.

“Can’t I call you if nothing happened?” Gu Ning asked.

“Of course you can,” Leng Shaoting replied. Hearing that Gu Ning was fine, he was relaxed.

“Someone told me he likes me today,” Gu Ning said. However, the moment she said that she regretted it. She had no idea why she told Leng Shaoting.

However, Leng Shaoting’s heart tightened. He was disappointed, and asked in a hurry, “Do you like him?”
