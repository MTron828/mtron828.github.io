Chapter 2796: Defeat Kirk Thomas

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Although Kane Thomas was in a good condition now, he hadn’t made a full recovery yet, so he still needed rest.

On the way back, Gu Ning didn’t tell Kirk Thomas what happened just now, because he said that he had something to talk to Leng Yuanqian about. Although Gu Ning knew that it wasn’t a good thing, she didn’t have to know what it was.

It only took Gu Ning slightly more than half an hour from leaving to returning, but for the others it felt like a long time, because other than Si Jin, they were all worried about her.

Si Jin wasn’t worried about Gu Ning, because she was aware of Gu Ning’s abilities. Therefore, when Gu Ning came safely back, Leng Yuanqian and the others were extremely relieved.

“How is it?” asked Leng Yuanqian.

“Mr. Thomas’s son is already awake. Both his injury and original cardiovascular disease have been cured. In fact, I saved his son’s life. After all, the cardiovascular disease is a fatal, high-risk disease, and there aren’t many people who can survive it, so…” Gu Ning said to Leng Yuanqian, then turned to look at Kirk Thomas. “Mr. Thomas, it’s time to let us see Mr. Leng’s daughter.”

When Gu Ning said that she hadn’t only cured Kirk Thomas’s son’s head injury, but had also cured his cardiovascular disease, everyone was surprised.

It was really unbelievable, because she had only been gone for a very short time!

“Of course, but Leng Shaoting and this miss must stay with us,” said Kirk Thomas. He didn’t take his promise seriously at all. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Hearing that, everyone was mad. Leng Yuanqian criticized him in anger. “Mr. Thomas, you should keep your word! You just promised us that we can take away my daughter and that you would stay away from them as long as this miss cures your son.”

“If you want to take your daughter home, do what I want,” said Kirk Thomas, breaking his promise.

“You’re shameless! I think I should make it clear to you. It’s impossible for Shaoting to marry your girl and this miss won’t stay,” said Leng Yuanqian with hatred.

“It’s not up to you,” said Kirk Thomas.

“You…” Leng Yuanqian was furious.

“Calm down. Leave it to me.” Gu Ning comforted Leng Yuanqian.

Leng Yuanqian listened to Gu Ning and closed his mouth for the time being.

Gu Ning coldly stared at Kirk Thomas, putting pressure on him. “Mr. Thomas, aren’t you afraid it’ll cause conflict between two countries?”

Kirk Thomas was struck dumb for a moment, because he was afraid of that, but he had his own methods.

When Gu Ning put pressure on him, Kirk Thomas also tried to make her feel stressed. However, no matter how he tried, Gu Ning was still more powerful than him. It displeased Kirk Thomas, but he could see that this girl was the most difficult person to deal with.

However, she was just an interpreter. How could she talk to him like that?

As a result, Kirk Thomas said in annoyance, “You have no say in this. I’m talking with Mr. Leng.”

“What do you think you are in our eyes, Mr. Thomas? If you don’t do what you promised, I’m afraid that we can only resort to violence. If it causes the Thomas family any trouble, you will have to bear it,” said Gu Ning provokingly.

Kirk Thomas was angered. He smirked and said, “This is our place. Do you think you can do whatever you want?”

Kirk Thomas didn’t believe Gu Ning and the others could cause them any trouble in their own place. After all, there were over a hundred armed guards in the Thomas family’s house.

“Really? Why don’t we try it now? But Mr. Thomas, are you sure you want to risk it?” asked Gu Ning.

She didn’t want to have a fight here, but if this was the only way, she wouldn’t hesitate. They weren’t dumb, so they would use their own ways to fight back.

Anyway, it wouldn’t be a serious problem as long as they didn’t kill anyone.

“Really? Show me what you can do,” said Kirk Thomas, accepting Gu Ning’s challenge.

Once Kirk Thomas finished speaking he raised his right hand and the eight bodyguards standing behind him immediately stepped out. The next moment they took out their guns, but they didn’t point at Gu Ning and the others.

“Kirk Thomas, do you know what you’re doing? I’m a senior official in my country. If you do this to me, your government will punish you!” Leng Yuanqian stood up angrily, shouting at Kirk Thomas.

“Don’t worry, I will be fine. I can handle it,” said Kirk Thomas airily, but he was actually unwilling to fire and was just trying to scare them.

At this moment, Gu Ning gave Si Jin a glance. Without delay, the two of them rushed forward like lightning. Before everyone realized what they were doing, Gu Ning and Si Jin reached Kirk’s bodyguards. Within moments, they grabbed the guns and injured them with their magical energy.

It was too late by the time those bodyguards came back to their senses. When Gu Ning and Si Jin were almost finished, several of the bodyguards wanted to fight back, but they were beaten up as soon as they moved.

Kirk Thomas was stunned, so he was controlled by Gu Ning before he could do anything.

It was not only Kirk Thomas, Leng Yuanqian and the others were also struck dumb. They didn’t expect Gu Ning and Si Jin to be so strong.

“Y-Y-You…” Kirk Thomas finally came back to his senses, but he was too frightened to say anything.

Gu Ning didn’t give him any chance to say anything, and directly gagged his mouth.

She took a towel from her telepathic eye space. Because they couldn’t see it clearly, Gu Ning didn’t pay attention to their reaction.

Nobody stopped Gu Ning from controlling Kirk Thomas because they disliked him as well.

“Go upstairs and bring Leng Shaojia down.” Gu Ning said to Si Jin.

“Sure.” Si Jin replied, going upstairs at once.

Hearing their conversation, Leng Yuanqian and the others were surprised. Leng Shaojia was upstairs? How did Gu Ning know that?

However, now wasn’t the time to ask about it.
