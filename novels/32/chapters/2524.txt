Chapter 2526: I Need Some Private Time Translations

Therefore, after taking a deep breath, Han Chenglin said seriously to Chu Peihan, “Chu Peihan, I have had a great interest in you from the day we met. I did everything, trying to be closer to you. After a while, I realized that I’m not just interested in you. I fell in love with you. Once I learned that you and my cousin, Xiaoyue, are classmates and you two are close friends, I bribed her. I told her not to tell you about our family relationship. She told me your schedule, so I could meet you ‘by chance’. I just wanted to see you more often. I thought that I could confess my affection for you after we became more familiar, but I didn’t expect to run into Han Zhexi today. He ruined my plan.”

Hearing Han Chenglin’s confession, Chu Peihan was struck dumb. It was beyond her imagination that Han Chenglin fell in love with her.

What surprised her more was that her heart began to pound in excitement.

Was she happy about that? Why? Did she like Han Chenglin too?

No, no, no, she didn’t think so!

Maybe she had a good impression of him, but it could hardly be considered love.

Suddenly, Chu Peihan didn’t know what to say. She really wanted to escape right now.

As a result, she directly stood up and said, “I don’t want the coffee anymore. Sorry, I gotta go.”

The moment she finished, she ran outside.

“Hey!” Shi Xiaoyue wanted to stop her, but Han Chenglin was faster, so she decided not to follow them.

After all, it wasn’t appropriate for her to be the third wheel, and the coffee they ordered was already on the table. She couldn’t waste it.

…

Han Chenglin caught up to Chu Peihan at the door and pulled her back.

He knew it wasn’t good, but he didn’t know what else he could do right now.

“Peihan, I mean every word I just said. I know you don’t hate me so much now. Can you give me a chance?” said Han Chenglin seriously.

After being pulled by Han Chenglin, Chu Peihan was very nervous. She had no courage to look at him. “It’s such a surprise. I-I need some private time to think about it,” she said, struggling hard.

Given Chu Peihan’s skills, it couldn’t be easier for her to get rid of Han Chenglin, but she didn’t want to hurt him, so she didn’t use a lot of force.

“I’m afraid you’ll disappear from my life.” Han Chenglin was a little aggrieved.

“No, I won’t. Please, let me go now,” said Chu Peihan subconsciously. She was scared by Han Chenglin’s sudden confession, and had no idea how to face it, but she didn’t really have the intention of rejecting him. She just panicked.

Given her personality, if she disliked a man, she would reject him without hesitation.

Only when she wasn’t sure of her feelings would she hesitate.

Chu Peihan never paid much attention to a romantic relationship, let alone being entangled.

“I can send you back to school,” said Han Chenglin. He didn’t want her to leave alone, even though she was a very strong girl. In fact, Chu Peihan would be safer alone than he would be, but he was worried about her right now.

“No, I’ll go back on my own,” said Chu Peihan with determination.

“Send me a message when you arrive, alright?” Knowing that Chu Peihan was determined, Han Chenglin didn’t dare to force her, in case she got mad. He could only ask her to send him a message after she arrived so that he could know she was safe.

“Sure.” Chu Peihan agreed in order to stop Han Chenglin from sending her back to school.

After that, Han Chenglin let Chu Peihan go and she immediately ran to the subway station.

At this moment, Chu Peihan’s cheeks were hot and red. She even felt too embarrassed to be in public.

…

Watching Chu Peihan run away, Han Chenglin didn’t return to the café until she totally disappeared from his sight.

He wanted to follow her till she was safely back at her school, but he understood that Chu Peihan would easily notice him if he really did that. And he was reluctant to anger her.

Therefore, Han Chenglin didn’t follow her. He could only wait till she sent him a message.

When Han Chenglin came back alone, Shi Xiaoyue wasn’t surprised, but she wasn’t sure of Chu Peihan’s attitude, so she asked, “Hey, what did she say?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“She said it’s a big surprise and she needs some time to think about it,” said Han Chenglin. Because he didn’t know that Chu Peihan also had a good impression of him, he was a little anxious.

“Obviously, she has a good impression of you. It just happened too suddenly, so she doesn’t know what to do. She just needs some time to think about it. Given what I know about her, she wouldn’t run away if she has no feelings for you. She would just reject you without hesitation,” said Shi Xiaoyue. She was certain that Chu Peihan had a good impression of Han Chenglin, but she didn’t know whether Chu Peihan liked him. After all, she hadn’t talked about it to Chu Peihan.

“Really?” Han Chenglin’s face lit up.

Actually, he knew Chu Peihan’s personality very well, but he was still afraid that Chu Peihan might reject him.

“Just give her some time. I won’t go back to school today. I’ll go to school tomorrow,” said Shi Xiaoyue. She didn’t dare to face Chu Peihan right now, so she decided to avoid her for the time being.

After that, Han Chenglin drove Shi Xiaoyue home.

Although Shi Xiaoyue didn’t go back to school, she still sent Chu Peihan a message of apology.

Shi Xiaoyue: Peihan, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have kept it a secret from you. But I didn’t mean to hurt you. I know I approached you for a purpose, but I was forced to do that. I hope you can forgive me. And my cousin really likes you. He’s a good man, otherwise I wouldn’t have agreed to help him. I’ve always treated you as my best friend and close sister. I promise I won’t push you into trouble. I don’t know whether you will be a good match, because it takes time to get to know each other, but if you think my cousin isn’t a bad guy, please give him a chance. You can break up with him if he isn’t the right one for you.
