3253 Helped Leng Xiaoyao?

“I found two pieces of wild ginseng and six reishi mushrooms this time. All of them are at least three hundred years old.” Leng Xiaoyao smiled and explained. She wasn’t affected by Song Meiyu’s words. Anyway, Song Meiyu would see them after the boxes were opened. Leng Xiaoyao could anger her by answering her questions for fun.

Song Meiyu was indeed mad and was even about to faint. Leng Yuqi’s face was also distorted in jealousy.

Two pieces of wild ginseng and six reishi mushrooms that were at least three hundred years old?

How much money would they be worth?

Wild ginseng and reishi mushrooms over a hundred years old were extremely valuable. These two older pieces of wild ginseng could be worth about seven million yuan. The six reishi mushrooms that were several hundred years old were worth about ten million yuan in all.

Wild ginseng and reishi mushrooms that were several hundred years old were very effective in medical treatments. Wild ginseng and reishi mushrooms on the market could only improve one’s physical condition over a long time.

“Yaoyao, you’re amazing! You found so many of them.” Leng Yecheng was short of words to describe his admiration for Leng Xiaoyao.

“Of course, like grandfather, like granddaughter,” Leng Xiaoyao said with satisfaction. Her words pleased Leng Changyuan, making him laugh.

“Are these all for your grandfather? Is there any for me?” said Leng Yecheng. He had great interest in these wild ginseng and reishi mushrooms. He didn’t want to eat or sell them. He simply wanted to collect them.

“This wild ginseng and these two reishi mushrooms are for you. The rest is grandpa’s,” said Leng Xiaoyao. She gave a younger piece of ginseng and two random reishi mushrooms to Leng Yecheng. She didn’t forget him.

“Really, thank you, Yaoyao!” Leng Yecheng was just saying it, but Leng Xiaoyao really gave some to him, so he was very happy.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t share them with Leng Yehua’s family, so they were displeased, especially Song Meiyu and Leng Yuqi. They held the strongest hostility towards Leng Xiaoyao.

Song Meiyu directly said, “Xiaoyao, shouldn’t you give some to your Uncle Yehua after giving them to your grandfather and Uncle Yecheng?”

She scolded Leng Xiaoyao for not treating them equally. Her husband and Leng Yecheng were both Master Leng’s sons. How could Leng Xiaoyao treat them unfairly?

“Shut your mouth!” Leng Yehua felt extremely embarrassed, so he immediately snapped at Song Meiyu.

Although he was also displeased when Leng Xiaoyao gave nothing to him, he clearly knew the reason, so he said nothing about it. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

After all, it was Leng Xiaoyao’s stuff. She could decide whom to share with, and he had no right to judge her.

Now Song Meiyu pointed it out, which only embarrassed him more.

“Don’t you know why Yaoyao would do that? Did you forget how you treat Yaoyao?” Leng Changyuan coldly asked Song Meiyu.

Song Meiyu opened her mouth wanting to say something, but didn’t know what to say.

Even if Leng Changyuan was right, she was unwilling to accept it.

“I’m going back to my room now.” Leng Yehua felt that he shouldn’t stay in the living room any longer, so he walked away.

The others felt the same and returned to their rooms.

“Humph!” Leng Changyuan snorted. Although he was upset that the family was arguing with one another, he couldn’t do anything about it.

After all, it was Leng Yehua’s family’s fault, so he obviously sided with Leng Xiaoyao.

It was already very nice of him that he didn’t chase them out of the house. After all, Leng Yecheng paid for this house.

Even if Leng Yehua was a senior official in the government, his salary wasn’t very high. He could afford a 100-square-meters house, but he couldn’t afford a large house.

However, they weren’t grateful at all and even wanted to steal it.

Leng Xiaoyao was unwilling to talk with them. She didn’t want Leng Changyuan to be affected either. Therefore, she immediately changed the topic. “Grandpa, you’re in a good condition right now, but you can be physically stronger. Don’t eat too much at a time, or it’ll damage your health. I’ll write down a food therapy prescription for you later. You can eat them twice or three times a week.”

“Isn’t it a waste if I eat them?” Leng Changyuan asked.

“They would only be wasted if you don’t eat them and simply put them away. We don’t lack money. Your health is more important,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Leng Changyuan agreed with Leng Xiaoyao, so he no longer thought it was a waste. At the same time, he was very touched. “Great, you can make the decision.”

Leng Yecheng didn’t want to eat them, so he decided to put them away.

…

Song Meiyu followed Leng Yehua back to their room, then she complained. “Leng Xiaoyao showed no respect for you. Has she forgotten that you’re her uncle!”

Song Meiyu felt that Leng Xiaoyao shouldn’t treat them like this even though they had treated her badly before. Even if Leng Xiaoyao didn’t give them ginseng, she should give them two reishi mushrooms!

“Enough! After Yuyi did those things to her, do you think Leng Xiaoyao will still be nice to us? Although you’re dissatisfied, why did you have to say it aloud and embarrass me?” Leng Yehua was mad.

“I know Yuqi has stolen Chu Jianan from Leng Xiaoyao, but it was Chu Jianan who preferred Yuqi to her. If Chu Jianan had chosen Leng Xiaoyao, Yuqi wouldn’t have successfully stolen him. I think Yuqi has helped Leng Xiaoyao. If Leng Xiaoyao really married Chu Jianan, she would have lived a bad life! And, if it hadn’t been for Yuqi’s relationship with Chu Jianan, Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t have become so different.” Song Meiyu argued. She felt that Leng Xiaoyao should thank them because she changed so completely because of Leng Yuqi.

“Enough, whatever you’re thinking about, don’t tell anyone. Don’t humiliate me.” Leng Yehua snapped at her. In fact, he agreed with Song Meiyu even if it was amoral. However, no one was completely selfless.

If they weren’t selfish, they would have stopped Leng Yuqi from having a secret relationship with Chu Jianan, or if Chu Jianan was born in an ordinary family, he wouldn’t have let them be together. However, Chu Jianan’s family was very rich, so he didn’t oppose it and even went against his father to support Leng Yuqi.

Anyway, he still wanted to save face and didn’t want to say it aloud.

After Leng Yehua finished, he walked out of the bedroom to the study. He wanted to be alone for a while.

Song Meiyu was reluctant to accept the result, but she could do nothing about it.

…

Leng Xiaoyao went back to her room later and only came out for dinner at 6 pm.
