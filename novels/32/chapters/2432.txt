Chapter 2433: Zhang Zikai Is Abducted

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Some parents asked for a very high bride price when their daughters got

married. It was beyond what the bridegroom could afford, so the wedding was

ruined.

A betrothal gift was a part of traditional customs, but marriage wasn’t a deal.

Parents shouldn’t sell their daughters for money. It was a gift and the number

shouldn’t be too high, unless the bridegroom was willing to give more.

Actually, some men were very mean and calculating. They didn’t want to pay a

cent when they married a woman and even blamed the bride’s parents for

selling their daughter.

The world was big and had all kinds of people. It would be best when both the

bride and bridegroom agreed to the conditions for marriage.

“My family doesn’t have the thought of using my marriage to make a deal with

the rich or the powerful. They just hope that I can marry a man from a family

of the same status as my family. If there is a huge gap, it might cause

problems,” said Zhang Zikai.

“It’s true, especially when the wife’s family is more influential than the

husband’s. Most men have a big ego. They are normally unwilling to marry a

woman whose family is more influential than theirs, because it makes him feel

inferior to his wife. Even if they accept it for love or for money, they’ll still be

mentally unstable if they can prove themselves in the future. They’ll betray

you. Well, there are good men, but it’s really hard to find one in today’s society.

You never know what kind of man you marry until his real color is exposed,”

said Gu Ning.

In today’s society, there were more people who cared about status than those

who didn’t, so it was a realistic, not an idealistic world.

For example, when Gu Ning became Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend, after she found

out his family’s status, she had asked him whether his family would dislike her.

She had her pride, and didn’t want to be disdained. She was also ambitious, and

she wouldn’t stop making new achievements.

Even if Leng Shaoting’s family didn’t accept her, she wouldn’t be affected,

because she only cared about Leng Shaoting’s attitude. As long as Leng

Shaoting defended her, she wouldn’t mind what the Leng family said about her

and she would be together with him.

As for those who disdained her, she would take them as strangers.

In their relationship, if Leng Shaoting hesitated to protect her, she would leave

him without delay. Her pride wouldn’t allow her to yield.

I think men nowadays are even more realistic than women. Just take those

men I met as examples, women actually don’t care much about a man’s

background, but men are different. They want a wife who’s no worse than him

and can make money, give birth to kids, and take care of the family. They’re

looking for a free servant. My uncle divorced last week, just because my aunt

didn’t want to do housework after she came back home from her work. In fact,

after my aunt gave birth, she kept their home clean and tidy that year, but my

uncle blamed her for not working. Men are never satisfied. And my aunt

couldn’t stand him any longer. She divorced him and left with the kid,” said

Zhang Zikai. She disapproved of her uncle’s behavior and even swore at him

when she heard the news.

Actually, she only complained about that at her home, because it was her

uncle’s family affair and she couldn’t judge him.

Her mother, however, directly criticized her uncle to his face, but her uncle

didn’t think it was his fault, so her mother had to stay away from her uncle.

Two days ago, her uncle called her mother for help, but her mother refused.

Although they were cousins, her mother disliked her uncle, because her uncle

wasn’t a good man.

“Well, I hope we can meet good men. There are no perfect men in this world, Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

but we don’t need a perfect man. We just want him to be upright, caring, and

loving. Even though that kind of man seems really rare,” said Song Miaoge. She

was worried that she might meet a terrible man.

After eating, they didn’t go somewhere else, and instead just went to their own

homes. Because it was still early, Gu Ning didn’t drive them home. They would

usually be safe by themselves.

Unfortunately, accidents happened when you thought it was impossible.

Gu Ning didn’t leave until her female friends left in a taxi. However, ten

minutes later, Gu Ning received Zhang Zikai’s call. Strangely, Zhang Zikai

wasn’t talking to her, she was talking to the taxi driver.

“Hey, I think you just took the wrong way. I remember that we shouldn’t

change direction here,” said Zhang Zikai. She sounded calm, but Gu Ning could

hear that she was nervous.

Upon hearing that, Gu Ning understood that something was wrong. Therefore,

she immediately told Gao Yi to turn their car to chase after Zhang Zikai. At the

same time, she kept listening to their conversation on the phone.

“There is a lot of traffic on the road alhead, so we can go faster by taking this

road,” said the taxi driver.

Zhang Zikai was borm in the capital, so she couldn’t be more familiar with it.

She often went to the city center and she knew whether it was the road back

home by a glance. Therefore, she was clearly aware that the taxi driver took the

wrong road. It wasn’t the way to her home. She felt that she might have been

abducted.

“Alright,” said Zhang Zikai. She stopped asking about that, then hung up and

sent Gu Ning her location.

Zhang Zikai was very nervous and was trembling a little, but she had to calm

herself down. Because she knew that Gu Ning was coming to save her, she

could keep calm for now.

The taxi driver glanced at Zhang Zikai in the rearview mirror once in a while.

When he saw the calm expression on Zhang Zikai’s face, he thought that she

believed him.

She wasn’t playing on the phone either, so he wasn’t worried that she was

already alert.

Gao Yi drove as fast as possible towards the location Zhang Zikai sent them. He

didn’t care about how many red traffic lights there were along the way, because

he needed to save a girl.

Zhang Zikai wasn’t separated from Gu Ning for long, and the taxi driver didn’t

drive fast, so Gu Ning caught up to the taxi after ten minutes.
