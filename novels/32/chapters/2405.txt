Chapter 2406: Who’s the Criminal?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning immediately used her Jade Eyes and looked into the holly bush. There was a mess under the holly tree, but it couldn’t be seen from the surface, because the leaves of the holly tree were very lush, covering everything under the ground.

Under the holly tree, the soil had been dug up, and a piece of cloth was exposed fifty centimeters down.

Gu Ning looked deeper and saw a corpse. The piece of cloth was the clothing it had on.

It was a female, and she should be about thirty years old.

The corpse had already begun to decompose, so there was a rancid smell, but it wasn’t completely decomposed. In that case, the woman should be dead for no more than a week.

Other than the rancid smell of the corpse, Gu Ning did not feel any evil from it, which confused her.

If the body wasn’t covered in evil force, how was the dog affected by it?

It seemed to be complicated. However, when the dog came here and smelled the stench, it began to struggle. Although Leng Shaoting had let it go, it was temporarily unable to get up and walk, and was still lying on the ground.

The woman was buried here after being killed, so it was obviously a murder.

Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting what she saw, and Leng Shaoting’s face became cold. “Let’s call the police. The police can deal with it.”

It was the police’s job, so they shouldn’t and didn’t need to be involved.

“Of course.” Gu Ning nodded. She had the same idea.

After that, Leng Shaoting called the police, while Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see whether there was anyone else in the house.

Gu Ning thought that there shouldn’t be anyone else in it, because the stench was extremely unpleasant. If there was anyone else living in this house, the corpse would have been removed already.

Without surprise, she saw nobody in the house.

Because there was no investigation yet, Gu Ning didn’t think further about that. She directly left it to the police.

As for who could be the criminal, both Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting believed that it was highly possible to be the owner of this house. Only when the criminal was the owner of this house could the holly tree attract no attention when it was moved.

If the criminal was really the owner of this house, what could be their motive? There could be countless motives.

If they were family, the criminal might be the dead woman’s husband. They might have become enemies in their relationship, or for money, or in a fight.

It was just Gu Ning’s doubt, and might not be the truth, but she thought it was very likely.

Leng Shaoting didn’t call the police station, but directly called a leader in the Public Security Bureau. Because it wasn’t work hours, it would be faster if a leader received the report.

It was Leng Shaoting’s call, so the leader sent some policemen to Huafu Hills at once.

Although it wasn’t work hours, they had to be up and ready for work by now. Therefore, the team of policemen immediately took action.

The deputy director of the Pucheng District Public Security Bureau was sent, because Huafu Hills was located in Pucheng District. It was faster for them to come.

About half an hour later, they arrived.

There were six policemen in all. In addition to the deputy director, the rest all had a high rank, and two were even medical examiners.

When Leng Shaoting reported the case, he had explained the situation to them, so they directly brought medical examiners with them. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Hi, honored to see you. Are you Major General Leng?” Upon seeing Leng Shaoting, the deputy director asked him respectfully.

Even though the deputy director was years older than Leng Shaoting, Leng Shaoting had a higher rank than him, so he had to respect Leng Shaoting.

“Yes,” said Leng Shaoting.

“Well, I’m the deputy director of the Pucheng District Public Security Bureau, Zhang Jingnan.” Zhang Jingnan introduced himself.

“Nice to meet you, Director Zhang. Please help us deal with this case. We need to know who the criminal is,” said Leng Shaoting. He was putting pressure on them, to prevent the criminal from getting away with it.

If the criminal was really the owner of this house, the criminal should have some influence. After all, people who lived in Huafu Hills were either rich or powerful.

“No problem, Major General Leng, we will surely find the truth as soon as possible,” said Zhang Jingnan. It was an order from Leng Shaoting, so he didn’t dare to take it lightly.

After that, they took over and conducted an investigation.

Even if the owner of the house wasn’t home, the police came to carry out their duty, so they could get in without permission.

Although Zhang Jingnan took over, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t leave right away. They had confidence in Zhang Jingnan, but they wanted to know who the woman was.

Leng Shaoting just called Jing Yunyao and told her that they encountered some trouble and would be home a little later. Jing Yunyao could have breakfast before them.

After the police entered the yard, they soon smelt the stench. It was so unpleasant that they immediately put on a mask.

It was what medical examiners always carried with them, because they often touched smelly corpses. They would only feel less uncomfortable with a mask on.

“Major General Leng, do you need one?” Zhang Jingnan asked Leng Shaoting. If there was a distance, it actually wasn’t that stinky, but it was better if they put on a mask before going closer.

“No need,” said Leng Shaoting.

Since Leng Shaoting didn’t need it, Zhang Jingnan didn’t insist.

Afterwards, two policemen went to move the holly tree, and saw what was inside, then immediately dug into the soil.

While they tried to dig the body out, a policeman was sent to the estate management company for the number of the owner of this house.

They got through to the owner of this house, but the man hung up in horror once he heard that the police had found a female body in his yard. When the police called him again, his phone was turned off.

Given his reaction, the police believed that the male owner of this house was highly likely to be the criminal. And they needed to catch him.

After the female corpse was examined, they found many bruises on the woman’s body, but they weren’t serious. The back of her head had been severely hit, which caused her death.

After examining the woman’s body, the police went into the house to search for clues.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting followed them.. They had confidence in the police, but they also wanted to find out how the dog ended up covered in the evil force.
