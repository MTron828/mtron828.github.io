Chapter 834: The Famous Goddess Gu

“Nice to meet you, my name’s Gu Ning,” Gu Ning said and kindly reached out her hand.

Zhang Zikai got excited, and shook hands with Gu Ning at once. “It’s so nice to meet you! My name’s Zhang Zikai, and I’m a big fan. I always wanted to see you in City F one day, and I’m so excited to meet you here! Can we be friends?”

Zhang Zikai admired Gu Ning very much.

Others who heard the conversation were quite confused. They didn’t understand why Zhang Zikai was a big fan of Gu Ning’s. Gu Ning’s outstanding appearance wasn’t a persuasive reason after all.

Gu Ning was amused again. Although she knew nothing about Zhang Zikai yet, she sensed that Zhang Zikai was a good girl. “Sure, why not.”

With Gu Ning’s agreement, Zhang Zikai almost jumped with delight. “Yeah! From now on, we’re friends!”

“Do you have to be so happy? There is nothing to be happy about!” Song Siyao muttered to herself. Her voice wasn’t loud, but Gu Ning still heard it.

“Goddess Gu, can I buy you a meal?” Zhang Zikai invited her with excitement.

“Please call me Gu Ning, and allow me to do that!” Gu Ning said.

“Fine.” Zhang Zikai agreed. She had learned some about Gu Ning’s business, so she knew that Gu Ning didn’t lack money at all.

“Ningning, how about me?” Su Anya said and sounded aggrieved.

Gu Ning then introduced Zhang Zikai to Su Anya without delay. “This is my friend too, Su Anya, she’s also from City F.”

“Hi, nice to meet you. Since we’re both Ningning’s friends, we’re friends too!” Zhang Zikai gave Su Anya a hug. She called Gu Ning Ningning as well, because it sounded like they were close.

“Nice to meet you!” Su Anya was very kind to Gu Ning’s friend.

Although participants had to stay in this hotel, they could go out by themselves after registering, they just had to be back before 9 pm.

“Please wait a second. We need to tell our teacher first,” Gu Ning said to Zhang Zikai.

“No problem,” Zhang Zikai said. Gu Ning and Su Anya went upstairs afterwards. Zhang Zikai also went to register herself before she waited for Gu Ning and Su Anya in the hall.

“Hey, can you tell me why you called the girl Goddess Gu?” a girl walked to Zhang Zikai and asked her with curiosity when she was alone.

“You can search her name on the Internet, and you’ll find out yourself,” Zhang Zikai said with pride.

Hearing that, students around them were all interested and took out their phones to search for news about Gu Ning. After reading a lot of information on Gu Ning, they were all shocked.

“Jesus! She’s so unbelievable.”

“She’s a kung fu master and a successful businesswoman!”

“Is she really a human being?”

“I think she’s a real goddess.”

“She’s only 18!”

...

They were all impressed by Gu Ning’s achievements, and regarded her as a goddess now.

Zhang Zikai sent a message in the WeChat group of her friends, and told them that she had just met Goddess Gu in real life. She also became Goddess Gu’s friend. Her friends were all envious of her, and asked her for a photo of Gu Ning.

Zhang Zikai’s friends were also fans of Gu Ning.

Song Siyao and the male teacher were already gone at this moment, so they still knew nothing about Gu Ning. However, the male teacher soon found out why Gu Ning was so different from other students after he went to ask a staff member of the Education Bureau.

Gu Ning was the founder of both Jade Beauty Jewelry and Charm at such an early age. Given her outstanding achievements, the Education Bureau treated her differently, which was understandable. She needed time to deal with her businesses after all.

The male teacher from the capital was convinced. He even felt a little embarrassed because he had just despised Gu Ning. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Gu Ning’s teacher told her some of the competition rules, then let her go with Su Anya.

Gu Ning promised that she would send Su Anya back before 9 pm, and their teacher trusted her.

Those students who learned Gu Ning’s real identity from Zhang Zikai stayed in the hall, waiting to see Gu Ning again with their own eyes.

Around 20 minutes later, Gu Ning walked out, and their eyes lit up at once, but none of them dared to go forward to bother her.

Gu Ning also noticed their reaction, but remained silent.

Seeing Gu Ning walking out with Su Anya, Zhang Zikai stood up, running to them like a happy little girl.

In fact, Zhang Zikai was a mature and stable girl normally, but she was too excited today to control herself.

The others were all envious of Zhang Zikai when she left with Gu Ning. They all wished that they could be Gu Ning’s friends.

Gu Ning didn’t drive there, but she had to send Zhang Zikai and Su Anya back a while later, so she asked the hotel for a car.

When she started the car, Gu Ning asked, “What do you want to have?”

“Anything is fine. I’m not picky,” Zhang Zikai said.

“Are you allergic to anything?” Su Anya asked.

“Nope,” Gu Ning and Zhang Zikai said.
