3030 She’s So Strong

“Sure.” Leng Changyuan answered in a flat tone, then Song Meiyu immediately went upstairs.

Afterwards, Leng Yehua went to his study.

In Leng Yuqi’s room.

Song Meiyu knocked on the door for a long while before Leng Yuqi opened it. “Qiqi, didn’t Leng Xiaoyao cheat? How is it possible that she suddenly became so good at studying?” Song Meiyu asked.

!!

Given the situation, Leng Yuqi couldn’t hide it any longer, so she told Song Meiyu about what had happened in their school.

After hearing Leng Xiaoyao’s deeds, Song Meiyu was shocked, but she still couldn’t figure out why Leng Xiaoyao suddenly became so excellent. Anyway, it was an undeniable truth that Leng Xiaoyao was very different now.

Therefore, Song Meiyu was upset as well.

Leng Xiaoyao chatted with Leng Changyuan for a while, then returned to her room. She turned on her laptop and continued to watch Xi Keyi’s apartment, but she saw nothing special.

The next morning, Leng Xiaoyao had breakfast before going to the hospital.

Although they had an appointed meeting at 2 pm, she needed to go over early to see whether there was anything she needed to prepare.

That morning the doctor noticed that Leng Yecheng and Chen Yuxi had changed their medicines. He immediately stopped and lectured them, but Leng Yecheng and Chen Yuxi insisted, and asked the doctor to check their condition. The new medicines didn’t harm them. Instead, they were recovering faster.

After checking their condition, the doctor surprisingly found that Leng Yecheng and Chen Yuxi were indeed much better. Therefore, he didn’t stop them again, and instead asked them about the new medicines.

Leng Yecheng didn’t say that it had something to do with Leng Xiaoyao. He explained that he had a friend who was adept at Chinese medicine. When his friend heard they were injured, he gave them formulas and they prepared the new medicines to take and apply to their wounds.

The truth proved that the new medicines were very effective. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Although only a day had passed, Leng Yecheng was much better and was full of energy again. He just couldn’t walk yet.

As a result, when Leng Xiaoyao and he went to the business meeting, he had to go to the company in a wheelchair.

Because Fengshang Design was still a small company, there weren’t so many good business people and Leng Yecheng had to do deals on his own many times.

This time, it was a very important deal, so Leng Yecheng needed to go in person.

Chen Yuxi was also a bit better, but he wasn’t as energetic as Leng Yecheng, so he couldn’t go with him.

He blamed himself, but there was nothing he could do. Luckily, Leng Xiaoyao could help him.

When Leng Yecheng told Chen Yuxi that Leng Xiaoyao would replace him for the business deal, Chen Yuxi was astonished and couldn’t believe his ears, but since Leng Yecheng agreed, he believed that Leng Xiaoyao was able to strike the deal.

The supervisor of Fenglin Yuan had also heard about the car crash Leng Yecheng had been in. Yesterday afternoon, he contacted Leng Yecheng. After making sure that their meeting could be held at the appointed time, they didn’t cancel it.

They were very satisfied with Fengshang’s design, so they were willing to postpone the meeting if it was necessary, but if it was delayed for a long time, they wouldn’t be able to stay patient. After all, they didn’t have much time to waste.

After everything was ready, they had lunch, then set off. Leng Yecheng went there in the wheelchair provided by the hospital.

When they got in the car, Leng Yecheng wanted to ask the chauffeur to lift him inside, but Leng Xiaoyao did it before the chauffeur and put Leng Yecheng in the rear seat.

That scene shocked a lot of people.

She looked like a weak girl, but unexpectedly she easily lifted a man that was 1.8 m tall and who weighed more than 50 kg.

Even though Leng Yecheng knew Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t weak and that she was good at kung fu, he was still amazed.

Leng Xiaoyao was extremely strong!

“Jesus, that girl is so strong!”

“Right, she easily lifted such a large man.”

“It’s unbelievable.”

The chauffeur had no reaction. He didn’t come back to his senses and get in the car until Leng Xiaoyao called him.

“M-Miss Leng, you’re so strong!” The chauffeur swallowed in shock.

Leng Xiaoyao smiled, but said nothing.

This chauffeur was Leng Yecheng’s executive chauffeur. Normally, he drove the car though Chen Yuxi would sometimes be the driver.

However, unfortunately the accident happened when Chen Yuxi drove the car.

Luckily, only the two of them were in the car. If there had been more people in the car, more of them would have been injured, which was the last thing they wanted to see.

At about 1:30 pm, they arrived. The meeting was half an hour later, but they came earlier in order to show their sincerity.

When they got out of the car, Leng Xiaoyao helped Leng Yecheng once again. This time, many employees from the company saw them and were surprised. Looking at Leng Xiaoyao, they were full of admiration.

The chauffeur waited in the car, while Leng Xiaoyao pushed Leng Yecheng into the company.

This company was a construction company called Daxing Construction, which was a large company in City Chang.

Fenglin Yuan was a mountain villa in the ancient style built by Daxing. Although Daxing had its own design team, their boss was unsatisfied with it, so they turned to work with another company.

After bidding, Fengshang Design won the chance, but it wasn’t finalized yet. They wouldn’t sign the contract until the final result was out.

Today was the day when the final result would be out, so Leng Yecheng attached a lot of importance to it.

In fact, he paid a lot of attention to it from the beginning.

Leng Xiaoyao and Leng Yecheng reached the front desk of Daxing, then told the receptionist why they were there. The receptionist immediately contacted the supervisor, then took them upstairs to the meeting room.

Because it wasn’t time yet, there was nobody in the meeting room, but only a dozen minutes were left, so they waited there until the team that was responsible for Fenglin Yuan came.

“Manager Shen, I’m terribly sorry. Because of the car crash, I have to sit in this wheelchair.” Leng Yecheng apologized to the supervisor of this project.

“Don’t say that, Executive Leng. I know it’s not what you want,” Manager Shen, the supervisor of this project, said.
