Chapter 2497 Will She Pay Us Back?

“Will she pay us back?” Jing Yunyan asked again. He knew more about Jing Yunyao’s story than Liu and Jing Bingjie. He understood that his older brother and sister had bullied Jing Yunyao a lot when they were little. Because of his mother, Jing Yunyao’s mother died.

Now Jing Yunyao reached a high level and joined Shangguan Yang. If she wanted to pay them back, the Jing family would be in a serious crisis.

“Who does she think she is? The Jing family raised her. She should be grateful. How could she break the rules of the cultivation world? She should be punished. Since she had good luck and survived, she should have learnt to behave herself. She shouldn’t step into the cultivation world again! If she dares to do so, she’ll break the rules once more. Even if we don’t punish her, Tiandaozong will,” said Jing Yaorong angrily.

That was his own values. He believed that the Jing family raised Jing Yunyao so she should be grateful to them. Anyway she ought to be killed after she went against the rules in the cultivation world. Therefore, he didn’t think Jing Yunyao dared to pay the Jing family back.

Jing Yaorong didn’t feel guilty at all about Jing Yunyao’s death. He blamed Jing Yunyao for everything. However, he actually wasn’t as confident as he seemed on the surface.

It wasn’t a problem if he only punished Jing Yunyao, but he had attacked Jing Yunyao’s husband too. Jing Yunyao’s husband was a mortal. Therefore, if it went public, justice wouldn’t stand with him.

Jing Yunfei, however, felt a little embarrassed, because he remembered how they bullied Jing Yunyao when they were little.

To be honest, if he were Jing Yunyao, he would also harbor a grudge and be determined to take revenge. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Now, he figured out why Jing Yunyao deliberately trapped him and made him lose three fingers.

Jing Yunfei wondered whether it was just the beginning or if it was already over.

“But…” Jing Yunyan didn’t think Jing Yaorong was wrong, but he felt it wasn’t an easy problem.

“Alright, that’s it. We don’t need to be afraid of Jing Yunyao!” Jing Yaorong disliked them being cowards, so he refused to continue to talk about that. The next moment, he strode outside.

When Jing Yaorong was gone, Jing Yunyan asked Jing Yunfei, “Yunfei, do you think it’s possible?”

In fact, he wasn’t too scared, but he was afraid that the Jing family would get in trouble.

The Jing family was already left behind by the other major families. So if any accidents happened, they would lose their position.

Jing Yunyan was the heir of the Jing family, so he definitely didn’t want the Jing family to end up in trouble.

“No idea, but I just feel Jing Yunyao won’t let it go. She’ll pay us back sooner or later,” said Jing Yunfei.

“W-What should we do?” Liu asked anxiously. Although she had never seen Jing Yunyao before, as a member of the Jing family, she might not be able to get away.

“Don’t be too worried. It might not really happen. Although Jing Yunyao has Shangguan Yang’s support and Shangguan Yang is a distinguished guest of Tiandaozong, Tiandaozong won’t allow them to just do anything they want in the cultivation world,” said Jing Yunfei. Although he thought that Jing Yunyao would certainly pay them back, she might not be able to really hurt them.

Hearing that, they were slightly relieved. After that, they walked out, leaving Jing Yunfei alone in the study. He needed some private time.

When they were gone, Jing Yunfei raised his right hand. Looking at the three fingers he lost, he was really mad.

He remembered that he had almost broken Jing Yunyao’s fingers once when they were little. If Jing Jining hadn’t shown up at that time, he could have really broken Jing Yunyao’s fingers. He also remembered that it took a long time for Jing Yunyao’s fingers to recover.

All of a sudden, Jing Yunfei thought of an important problem.

Jing Jining had a very close relationship with Jing Yunyao, and he also knew Shangguan Yang. In that case, Jing Jining should also be aware that Jing Yunyao wasn’t dead.

Thinking of that, Jing Yunfei went to see Jing Yaorong at once.

Jing Yaorong was in a bad mood because of Jing Yunyao’s sudden appearance, so he didn’t go back to his room after leaving Jing Yunfei’s study. Instead, he went to his study. He needed some private time.

Two minutes later, Jing Yunfei came.

“Father, I just thought of one thing. Jing Jining has a very close relationship with Jing Yunyao, and he also knows Shangguan Yang. In that case, has Jing Jining always been aware that Jing Yunyao isn’t dead?” Jing Yunfei said.

Hearing that, Jing Yaorong rounded his eyes in shock and suddenly realized it was true.

“Jing Jining must be aware that Jing Yunyao is still alive!” Jing Yaorong was very sure of it.

In an instant, he was filled with anger and started blaming Jing Jining for it.

Jing Jining clearly knew that Jing Yunyao wasn’t dead, but he didn’t tell them, which meant he deliberately placed them in trouble.

Jing Jining had a close relationship with Jing Yunyao, but he was a member of the Jing family! How could he betray the Jing family for a traitor?

However, from Jing Jining’s perspective, he didn’t think it was necessary for him to tell the Jing family about it. He could make the decision about whom he should tell. Nobody could interfere in that.

“I wonder whether uncle knows too?” Jing Yunfei said. He didn’t think it was likely, but it could be possible, so he felt they should make certain.

“I don’t think your uncle is aware of that. Anyway, we need to ask him about it. If he doesn’t know about it, it won’t be a big deal. If he knows…” said Jing Yaorong.

If Jing Yanhua acted against him, there had to be a purpose. In that case, he wouldn’t allow Jing Yanhua to live a good life in the Jing family.

He never paid special attention to Jing Yanhua because he didn’t think Jing Yanhua could make any achievements. Jing Yanhua didn’t seem ambitious either.

Therefore, he thought that Jing Yanhua did not have the ambition to take over the Jing family. However, he needed to think twice now.

Jing Yanhua might not be able to make a great achievement, but Jing Jining could be a threat.
