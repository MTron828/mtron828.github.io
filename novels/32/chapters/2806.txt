Although Chang Kaixuan’s father was in the study, his shout was so loud that his wife in the next bedroom heard him, but she didn’t come over. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“It’s late now!” said Chang Kaixuan with reluctance.

“So? It won’t be sincere if you do it tomorrow. Do it right now, so that you can win their forgiveness. Remember to show that you know you’re wrong. Promise that you won’t do it again. Beg them to give you a chance,” said Chang Kaixuan’s father. He was furious because it was hard to educate his son.

“Fine!” Chang Kaixuan didn’t dare to argue against his father. No matter how reluctant he was, he had to change his clothing and visit the Fan family.

…

At that moment, Fan Junxin and Fan Yayue were on their way back home. Once they were in the car, Fan Yayue cried, but she didn’t cry loudly.

Fan Junxin understood that Fan Yayue was heart-broken, so he said nothing. She needed time to release her sadness.

Fan Junxin didn’t ask her until they were about home. “Are you sure you want to completely cut off your relationship with Chang Kaixuan?”

After witnessing what Chang Kaixuan did, he didn’t want Fan Yayue to be with Chang Kaixuan any longer, but it was Fan Yayue’s own affair, so he couldn’t make the decision for her. He needed to ask her opinion.

“Yeah, we’re not good for each other. We’re just fair to middling. He betrayed me today and took it for granted. Obviously, he has done it many times before. It’s impossible for him not to socialize with women normally, but I can accept it because it’s not too much. But I honestly can’t accept what he did today. I must cut off my relationship with him. But if dad still wants to support the Chang family, I won’t say anything. After all, politics are complicated, and this is just my own affair,” said Fan Yayue. She was very considerate, because she didn’t want her father to be affected.

“Don’t be silly. Even if we don’t support the Chang family any longer, there are many other families that want to draw us over to their side. Father was willing to support the Chang family because you were Chang Kaixuan’s girlfriend. Now the Chang family is in a very bad situation. Several of their family members are in trouble. I’m afraid they’re in a serious crisis. So, if you don’t want to be with Chang Kaixuan any longer, father surely will stop supporting them,” said Fan Junxin.

Hearing that, Fan Yayue cried more bitterly. She thought her father supported the Chang family for benefits, but unexpectedly her father did it for her.

“Alright, stop crying now. Since you have decided to break up with Chang Kaixuan, we can talk about it with our parents after we get home. Given the situation the Chang family is in right now, it’s better for us to leave them,” said Fan Junxin.

“Sure,” said Fan Yayue, suddenly feeling very relieved.

After they got home, Fan Junxin told their parents everything and their parents were furious too.

They also comforted Fan Yayue. They didn’t have to side with the Chang family. As soon as they left the Chang family, there would be many other families that wanted to draw them to their side.

In addition, given the current situation, it wouldn’t be good for them to stay with the Chang family, so it wasn’t a bad thing for them to leave the Chang family.

Hearing her father’s words, Fan Yayue felt much better.

Right at that moment, Chang Kaixuan came.

Seeing Chang Kaixuan, Fan Yayue’s parents were very angry. Her father angrily scolded him. “What are you doing here? You’re not welcome. Get out!”

Because there were already injuries on Chang Kaixuan’s face, Fan Yayue’s father didn’t punch him again. After all, Fan Junxin had already beaten Chang Kaixuan, it wasn’t right for him to do it again.

Chang Kaixuan was mad after being criticized by Fan Yayue’s father, but in order to win their forgiveness, he tolerated it and said, “I’m sorry, Mr. Fan. I promise I won’t do it again. Please give me a chance. I really love Yayue.”

“Love? If you really loved Yayue, you wouldn’t have hurt her like this. I’m afraid it’s not your first time, right? It just wasn’t exposed until today,” said Fan Yayue’s father mockingly. He didn’t believe Chang Kaixuan’s words at all and believed that Chang Kaixuan couldn’t control his desire. It definitely couldn’t be his first time.

“No, I didn’t. I was just a little drunk today. And the woman seduced me, so I…” Chang Kaixuan said softly.

He was drunk and the woman seduced him? What a typical excuse for men’s cheating on their partners!

However, there were no idiots nowadays, so no one believed his excuse.

“Bulls*it! Do you think we’ll believe that,” said Fan Yayue’s father in anger.

“Mr. Fan, I’m really sorry. Please give me a chance, alright?” Chang Kaixuan was unwilling to argue with Fan Yayue’s father on that, because he had a sexual relationship with many women, but he just did it for fun, he would never get together with them.

From the beginning he knew he would marry Fan Yayue. For all kinds of reasons, Fan Yayue was his best choice.

“No!” Fan Yayue opened her mouth, glaring at Chang Kaixuan. “I feel disgusted to see you right now. Get out. I don’t want to see you again, and it’s impossible for me to forgive you.”

“Yayue, I’m sorry. Can’t you forgive me once? I won’t do it again.” Chang Kaixuan begged, but he felt aggrieved in his heart. His father forced him to do it, otherwise he wouldn’t have come.

“No way. No!” Fan Yayue said furiously. After that, she said to Fan Junxin. “Junxin, can you kick him out? I don’t want to see him again.”

The second Fan Yayue finished speaking, Fan Junxin walked to Chang Kaixuan. “Will you leave by yourself, or do you want me to kick you out?” he said in a tough tone.

“You…” Chang Kaixuan could barely control his emotions now. He felt they were out of line, because he already apologized and begged them, but they still refused to forgive him.

However, it wasn’t their duty to forgive him just because he apologized.

If an apology could make up for everything, the police and the law would be meaningless.

Chang Kaixuan couldn’t stand the humiliation, so he said nothing and left without hesitation.
