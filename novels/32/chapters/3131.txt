3132 Get into the Habit of Being Efficient

The next day, after Leng Xiaoyao arrived at school, An Chenmeng came to see her and gave the jade pendant to her.

Leng Xiaoyao wanted to keep the jade pendant for a few days, so she said it was still covered with evil power and she must keep it for a while.

An Chenmeng didn’t doubt it at all and left the jade pendant with Leng Xiaoyao.

In the afternoon, many students asked for leave because they needed to go home and prepare for Master Mo’s birthday party.

The National College Entrance Examination was around the corner, but they could still be absent for a night. After all, those students were all born in rich or powerful families. The school wouldn’t behave against them just because they asked for leave for half a day.

When Leng Xiaoyao went to school, she still had freckles on her face. She would put on make-up after going home.

Although it wouldn’t begin till 6 pm, most guests would arrive right after 5 pm. Because such an event was also a business party, which was a great chance for those distinguished guests to socialize with each other.

Therefore, they would normally set off after 4 pm. Therefore, Song Meiyu told Leng Yuqi to go get dressed after having lunch.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t rush to do that. She could change half an hour before they left.

Song Meiyu couldn’t wait any longer. Once they finished lunch, she asked Leng Yuqi to try on clothes.

In order to overshadow Leng Xiaoyao, Song Meiyu prepared three beautiful sets for Leng Yuqi to choose the best one.

Leng Yuqi was very pretty, so she looked good in each set, but she still wasn’t comparable to Leng Xiaoyao.

Leng Yuqi put on light make-up today.

Even if she was young and her skin was in a good condition, she needed to put on make-up since they needed to dress up.

Song Meiyu chose pink dresses which were ideal for young girls for Leng Yuqi. They were in European court style and barely showed skin, but they were beautiful.

After dressing up, Leng Yuqi went downstairs. Leng Changyuan was surprised by her beauty, but he still couldn’t like her upon thinking what she had done. As a result, he didn’t compliment Leng Yuqi.

No matter how beautiful Leng Yuqi was, she was not comparable to Leng Xiaoyao in his eyes.

After going downstairs, Leng Yuqi felt a little sad when Leng Changyuan didn’t compliment her, but she understood that Leng Changyuan was biased against her, so she didn’t blame him.

She only hoped that Chu Jianan would focus on her when he saw her later.

However, thinking of Leng Xiaoyao, Leng Yuqi suddenly lost confidence and looked unhappy.

Although Chu Jianan hated Leng Xiaoyao, she was still afraid that he might be attracted to Leng Xiaoyao. After all, Leng Xiaoyao was so pretty, even if she refused to admit it.

“Oh, isn’t Xiaoyao done yet? Isn’t she spending too much time on it?” Song Meiyu mocked before she saw Leng Xiaoyao. She implied that Leng Xiaoyao wasted a lot of time.

“It’s still early. No need to rush! If you don’t want to wait, you can go there before us, but you might be the only two guests there and you’ll be embarrassed,” Leng Changyuan said unhappily.

Song Meiyu was struck dumb for a second and felt even more annoyed, but she didn’t dare to argue with Leng Changyuan. “I’m not in a rush to go there. I simply feel we should be efficient in whatever we do. It’s a good habit to be efficient.”

Right at this moment, Leng Xiaoyao showed up at the landing. She heard Song Meiyu’s words, so she retorted. “Aunt Meiyu, you’re right. It’s a good habit of being efficient, but I’m not in a rush to put on make-up right now. After all, we’ll set off at 4:30 pm and it’s not too late if I dress at 4 pm. It’s only 3 pm now. I promise I won’t keep you waiting.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

They turned to look at Leng Xiaoyao and she indeed hadn’t dressed up yet.

Leng Changyuan wasn’t worried at all, because he believed Leng Xiaoyao could handle it, but Song Meiyu was unhappy when she heard that. However, she didn’t know what to say.

Looking at Leng Yuqi’s style, Leng Xiaoyao laughed to herself. She really doubted whether Chu Jianan would like the style.

Chu Jianan was a mature man, so she felt he must prefer a sexy and mature woman. Leng Yuqi looked cute and adorable, but couldn’t arouse a man’s desire.

Although Leng Yecheng didn’t prepare a sexy gown for her, she still showed some skin. The dress was really cool and she looked strong in it. It suited her very well.

Both Song Meiyu and Leng Yuqi hated Leng Xiaoyao’s confidence, but the cruel truth was that Leng Xiaoyao had the ability to be confident.

Exactly because Leng Xiaoyao had outstanding abilities, they were so jealous of her. If Leng Xiaoyao was only arrogant, they would laugh at her.

When they were about to set off, Leng Xiaoyao went to dress. Within ten minutes, she was done and she put on delicate make-up.

After that, she put on the gown and tied her hair up high to a ponytail. With a pair of high-heels, she went out of her room with a handbag.

It was five minutes before 4 pm, but everyone was waiting in the living room.

When they saw Leng Xiaoyao at the landing, they were completely amazed. She was gorgeous!

After coming back to their senses, Song Meiyu and Leng Yuqi were almost crazy with jealousy. They could barely hide their real feelings, but everyone focused on Leng Xiaoyao, so nobody saw their reaction.

However, Leng Xiaoyao noticed their expression. She only grinned because it wasn’t surprising. It was too funny.

“How is it? Am I pretty?” Leng Xiaoyao asked Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng, but her tone sounded very confident, which meant she understood that she looked pretty tonight.

“You’re extremely beautiful! Yaoyao, you’re going to be the party queen tonight!” Leng Changyuan complimented happily. It was hard for him not to be happy when his granddaughter was so stunning. In fact, he could barely stop beaming in happiness.

“Of course!” Leng Yecheng chimed in. He was very satisfied with the gown he chose. It was perfect on Leng Xiaoyao.
