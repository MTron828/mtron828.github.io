Chapter 661 Ten Years Aren’t Long

Leng Shaoting and Qiao Ya didn’t sit down until Tang Haifeng was seated on the sofa to show their respect for him.

“Father, he’s the eldest grandson of the Leng family, the youngest major general in history,” Tang Yunfan said.

“What?” Tang Haifeng was shocked too. “A-are you Master Leng’s grandson?”

“Yes, Master Tang,” Leng Shaoting replied.

“No wonder I thought you looked familiar when I met you the first time!” Tang Haifeng said.

Tang Haifeng and Master Leng got to know each other when they were still young, but they weren’t close. Tang Haifeng had also met Master Leng’s eldest son, who was Leng Shaoting’s father, many times. Leng Shaoting closely resembled his father, so Tang Haifeng thought that he looked familiar when they met for the first time. However, it had been ages, and Tang Haifeng was losing his memory, so he had failed to recognize Leng Shaoting at first sight.

Since Leng Shaoting was his acquaintance’s son, Tang Haifeng became much kinder to him, but he still stayed alert. “What’s your goal in the relationship with Ningning?”

“Be with her forever. Although Ningning hasn’t reached the age of consent yet, we can be engaged before that if you agree,” Leng Shaoting said with sincerity. In fact, he couldn’t wait a second longer to marry Gu Ning

“No way!” Tang Haifeng rejected at once. “If you’re engaged, Ningning will be a member of your family. Ningning hasn’t joined our family yet, and she’s just 18! I think she can stay in our family for another ten years. 10 years aren’t long.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting didn’t know what to say. Ten years? He couldn’t wait that long.

“Ningning can stay in the Tang family as she likes even if she’s engaged to me,” Leng Shaoting said a while later. Leng Shaoting was unwilling to stay in the Leng family’s house, so they would move out even though they were married. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“No, it feels different whether Ningning is engaged or not.” Tang Haifeng was still dissatisfied.

Leng Shaoting wasn’t very persuasive, and he could only look at Gu Ning for help in silence. However, Gu Ning pretended that she didn’t see it.

Although it was Gu Ning’s marriage, and nobody could interfere in it, the members of the Tang family felt reluctant to see her leaving them. They knew that they had been absent for a long time in Gu Ning’s life, so they had no right to make decisions for her.

Tang Haifeng was also worried that it might cause any conflicts if he was too tough, so he became a little soft. “It isn’t easy to marry my granddaughter, and we need to see your performance. If we’re satisfied, we can talk about it in the future, but we’ll never agree on it if you dare hurt Ningning.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was relieved. “Please trust me. I promise I’ll treat Ningning well.”

Nobody knew what was going to happen in the future, because plans couldn’t catch up with changes, but they still needed to live their lives. Therefore, they didn’t find fault with Leng Shaoting’s promise.

At this moment, the atmosphere became relaxed.

Gu Ning asked how the infighting in the Tang family’s company was now, but there was nothing new, so they didn’t know what their enemies were going to do next.

Tang Yunfan thought that it probably wouldn’t be a good idea if he still pretended to be unconscious, and the others all agreed that he should go back to work in the company after a few days if their enemies still did nothing.

Actually, Tang Weiyong wanted to take action, but he was waiting for the right time.

At the same time in Tang Weiyong’s house.

In the study on the second floor, Tang Weiyong sat by the desk, and there was a young man with a plain face sitting across from him.

“Is everything ready?” Tang Weiyong asked. “Yes,” the man said.

“Great! Tang Haifeng will leave the house tomorrow and we can take action then.” Tang Weiyong decided to hurt Tang Haifeng this time.

“Anything else, boss?” the man asked.

“Buy a piece of jade jewelry with a simple design at the Jade Beauty Jewelry store tomorrow, and make a copy of it,” Tang Weiyong said.

“Yes, sir,” the man answered and left.

Once the man was out, Tang Weiyong told Tang Xinrui to come in.

“Xinrui, do you have any ideas on how to approach Gu Ning?” Tang Weiyong asked.

He didn’t know whether he would succeed in hurting Tang Haifeng. Even if it was successful, he couldn’t let Gu Ning go. As long as Tang Xinrui could get close to Gu Ning, he would find out ways to deal with Gu

Ning.

Tang Weiyong had also read the news about Gu Ning, and he had to admit that Gu Ning was really amazing, so she would be his stumbling block if he didn’t deal with her.

“I met a man who’s a friend of a friend of Gu Ning’s, and they are going to attend the opening ceremony and runway show of Jade Beauty Jewelry tomorrow. I’ll go with them, so it won’t be difficult to approach Gu Ning,” Tang Xinrui said with confidence.

“Very well!” Tang Weiyong was satisfied.

“Oh, my older brother called me this afternoon for a million yuan, and he told me not to tell you, but I don’t have a million yuan, so I have to tell you,” Tang Xinrui said feeling cornered, and observed Tang Weiyong’s face in case he would be mad.

“What? A million yuan?” Tang Weiyong indeed was mad. “I just gave him a million yuan at the New Year festival. It’s just been a month. Why is he asking for money again?”

Although a million yuan was nothing in his eyes, he wouldn’t allow his son to waste his money like that. He needed his money for his career, but his son was a spendthrift.

“Did he tell you the reason why he needs so much money?” Tang Weiyong asked in a cold voice.

“He said he slept with a woman and was caught by the woman’s boyfriend, who’s a junior leader in the Mafia of Country Y, so he must pay a million yuan,” Tang Xinrui said.
