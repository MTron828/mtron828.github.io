After that, Gu Ning turned to look at Mr. He. “Well, well, you don’t look like a normal mortal, nor an evil cultivator. How long have you cultivated? Your level is so low.”

Mr. He was shocked. He didn’t expect that Gu Ning could see that he was an evil cultivator.

Mr. He was indeed an evil cultivator, but he was a new hand, so his level was very low.

If he met ordinary people, he would be very strong, but he was no match for Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting who were masters!

“Mr. He, did you cultivate on your own, or do you have a teacher?” Gu Ning asked.

If someone taught him, there must be an evil cultivator behind him.

“Who are you?” Facing Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting, Mr. He was very alert.

If Gu Ning could see that he was an evil cultivator, she must be a cultivator too.

“Haven’t you already found out my background? I’m Gu Ning, the chairman of the Shengning Organization, and I’m also a member of the Tang family. This is my husband.” Gu Ning smiled.

Mr. He didn’t care about that, but he knew they were also high level cultivators, so he was anxious.

If they had conflicts, he would definitely be at a disadvantage. In that case, he must be careful.

“What do you want?” Mr. He asked.

“What do I want to do? Didn’t I tell you that I’m going to explode you and your manor since you dare to bomb my company,” Gu Ning replied in a flat voice.

“I was just saying that. Miss Gu, please don’t take it seriously. I will apologize to you for that. Why don’t we get over it?” Mr. He said. Although he didn’t think Gu Ning would stop, he still wanted to try.

“You were just saying it? Mr. He, do you think that I’d believe you? Anyway, we exist to kill evil forces like you. So, even if you had no plan to damage my companies, I wouldn’t let you go,” Gu Ning said.

“…”

Mr. He had a premonition.

“However, if you are willing to tell me your purpose, I might let you live,” Gu Ning continued seriously. She wouldn’t kill Mr. He, but she would torture him.

“I don’t have any bad intentions. I just passed the order for someone else,” Mr. He said. Although his pride didn’t allow him to give in to Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting, he didn’t want to die.

“Oh, can you tell who it is?” Gu Ning asked.

“Will you let me go if I tell you?” Mr. He responded.

“Sure.” Gu Ning replied.

Mr. He wasn’t fully convinced, but he wanted to live, so he said, “Wei Qihua.”

Wei Qihua was the deputy secretary of City B and he never got along with Tang Yunhang who was the party secretary. He always wanted to replace Tang Yunhang. Therefore, he didn’t just target Meng Zhuokai, but also targeted Tang Yunhang.

“Really?” Gu Ning asked. She wouldn’t just believe whatever he said.

“Yes.” Mr. He answered.

“How did you know them?” Gu Ning asked. She glanced at the two vampires, indicating that she was talking about them.

“I need killers, so I turned to them for help,” said Mr. He.

Since that was the case, Gu Ning stopped asking.

“Since I promised that I would let you live, I won’t kill you, but I must disable you.” Saying that, Gu Ning attacked Mr. He.

“You…” Although Mr. He didn’t think Gu Ning would let him get away with it, he still hoped that she would have mercy. Therefore, when she attacked him, he was furious.

The moment Gu Ning moved, Leng Shaoting hit the two vampires as well. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Due to the large gap between their abilities, Mr. He and the two vampires were quickly beaten by Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t kill them, but they were all disabled. From now on, they were handicapped and wouldn’t be able to take care of themselves.

The noise of the fight soon attracted other people, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting directly jumped out of the window.

They had damaged the surveillance cameras with magical energy, so no one would know who did it.

After they left, they went straight back to the Tang family’s house.

Gu Ning didn’t call Tang Yunhang right away, because it was almost time for him to get off work. She decided to talk to him about when they finished their meal.

“It’s been a troubled time these past few days. We encountered trouble one after another.” Gu Ning suddenly had a premonition that more terrible things might happen.

“Why don’t you stay in City B? If anything happens, you can be here to help,” Leng Shaoting suggested. He also had a feeling that the trouble wasn’t over yet.

Shangguan Yang and Jing Yunyao could support the Leng family in the capital, but they needed someone to stay in City B to look after the Tang family.

Leng Shaoting needed to do his work, so he could only stay here for several days.

“Sure,” Gu Ning agreed. Given what had happened recently, she couldn’t go back to the capital right now.

If only mortals were causing trouble, they wouldn’t be worried, but monsters and ghosts were involved this time, so they had to be careful.

When Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting got back to the Tang family’s house, it was almost 5 pm.

They didn’t tell Tang Haifeng what they had been through today. After all, he was an old man, and they didn’t want to worry him.

At 6:30 pm, Tang Yunhang got home, and they began to have dinner.

After the meal, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting said that they wanted to have a private chat with Tang Yunhang, then they went to Tang Yunhang’s study.

“Uncle, when we left today, we noticed that some people were acting abnormally. We followed them, and found that they were from the same team who was sent to assassinate Meng Zhuokai. We interrogated them afterwards and learned that the mastermind is Wei Qihua. I’m not 100% sure, but I thought you should know,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Tang Yunhang was displeased, but wasn’t surprised, because he and Wei Qihua were enemies in politics. In fact, Wei Qihua had caused him trouble many times before.

“Although there isn’t evidence to prove that it is Wei Qihua, it’s highly likely. Otherwise it might be a trick played by my other enemies,” Tang Yunhang said.
