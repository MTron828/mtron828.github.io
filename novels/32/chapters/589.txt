Chapter 591 A Control Freak

“Great. I plan to do this trip quickly so I’ll go to the airport now,” Gu Ning said. Afterwards, she drove herself to the airport.

The Tang family already told the airport to receive her, so Gu Ning directly drove into the parking lot where the private jets landed and went aboard without delay.

...

Three hours later, the private jet landed at the airport of City G.

An exclusive car from the Huangdeng Hotel went to pick Gu Ning up on time.

It was lunch time, so Gu Ning decided to first have lunch at the Huangdeng Hotel, which was also arranged by Tang Yunfan.

Gu Ning called Zhou Zhenghong and wanted to invite him to join her for lunch but Zhou Zhenghong was in the factory, so Gu Ning decided to dine alone.

However, the moment Gu Ning walked into the hotel, she ran into Situ Ye, who was accompanied by two men and a woman. One of the men and the woman were foreigners. When Situ Ye saw Gu Ning, his eyes lit up.

“Wait a second. I see my friend,” Situ Ye said to them then strode to Gu Ning in a hurry.

The blond woman was upset and stared straight at Gu Ning, then asked the man who wasn’t a foreigner. “Who is she?”

“Sorry, no idea,” the man said. He, of course, knew that the young girl was Gu Ning, but Situ Ye had warned him not to hurt Gu Ning, so he kept it a secret. Besides, he knew that this blond woman was bad-tempered so he wasn’t willing to tell her anything important.

Gu Ning sensed the blond woman’s hostility towards her, and she realized that the blond woman must admire Situ Ye and was mad at her because Situ Ye walked to her without hesitation once she showed up. Anyway, Gu Ning didn’t care as long as the blond woman stayed away from her.

“When did you get here? Why didn’t you tell me?” Situ Ye asked Gu Ning, like she had hurt his feelings.

Gu Ning said, “I just arrived to deal with business here and I’ll leave soon.”

“You’ll leave soon?” Situ Ye frowned with disappointment.

“Yes, I’m busy,” Gu Ning said. “Are you alone?” Situ Ye asked.

“Yes,” Gu Ning answered.

“Why don’t we have a meal together?” Situ Ye said. In case Gu Ning would decline, he added, “We haven’t gathered together for a long time! You never call me when you come to City G unless you need my help.”

Gu Ning felt a little embarrassed because what he said was true. “Well, can we share a meal the next time?”

“Next time? When? You have never invited me to dine together in City G,” Situ Ye complained. “Come on, give me a chance. Xuanfeng is waiting for us in a private room

now.”

“Um, fine!” Gu Ning didn’t know how to reject it, so she agreed.

After that, Gu Ning followed Situ Ye, walking to his friends. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When the blond woman saw Situ Ye walking back with Gu Ning, she was annoyed and pointed at Gu Ning questioning Situ Ye in anger, “Situ, who is she?” She spoke in the local language, which was quite authentic.

Situ Ye was displeased. “None of your business. Show some respect.”

The blond woman was furious and felt hurt. “None of my business? You’re my fiancé! Who is she?”

Gu Ning was surprised. This woman is Situ Ye’s fiancée? She was surprised not because she didn’t want Situ Ye to have a fiancée but because she didn’t understand why Situ Ye, who was such a handsome man, would choose such a woman with a plain face and bad temper.

“Shut up!” Situ Ye was mad. In case Gu Ning would mistake their relationship, he snapped at the blond woman, “Aimee, since when did I become you fiancé? Don’t damage my reputation.”

“You’re my fiancé. Your father said that before,” Aimee argued.

“It was just a joke and I never agreed,” Situ Ye said.

In fact, it really was a joke between their parents but Aimee took it seriously, because she loved Situ Ye. Unfortunately, Situ Ye disliked her.

“I agreed, and I take it seriously, and you have to be responsible for my life!” Aimee said in a domineering tone.

Situ Ye lost his patience, and looked to the blond man standing by Aimee’s side. “Adam, tell your younger sister not to behave like a 3-year-old child.”

“Sure.” Actually, Adam didn’t want to be involved, because his family would benefit a lot from the marriage between his younger sister and Situ Ye, but Situ Ye gave him a warning so he had to stop his younger sister now.

“Aimee, you’re an adult now so behave like one. Stop arguing in public or I’ll arrange for someone to send you home,” Adam said.

Aimee was in a rage, but didn’t dare to argue again because she understood that her older brother was a doer, so she just glared at Gu Ning in the end. Although she closed her mouth, she remembered Gu Ning’s face in her mind.

Gu Ning, however, thought that this blond woman was crazy. Even if she was Situ Ye’s fiancé, she had no right to vent her anger at Gu Ning. In Gu Ning’s eyes, this blond woman was as possessive as Feng Xueqin and both of them were control freaks. Gu Ning was a little displeased, but ignored her. Gu Ning knew that the blond woman wouldn’t give up, but Gu Ning wasn’t afraid of her.

Situ Ye and Gu Ning walked at the front followed by the others, and Aimee kept staring at Gu Ning’s back like she was going to tear her to pieces. Aimee was so jealous because Situ Ye had never treated any women so gently, except Gu Ning.
