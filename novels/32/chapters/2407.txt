Chapter 2409: The Criminal Confessed

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Zhang Jingnan didn’t recognize Gu Ning, but heard other people’s discussions about her. They seemed to admire her very much. Who was this Miss Gu?

Even though he was confused, he understood that it wasn’t the right time to ask about it now.

Zhang Jingnan took Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting directly to the interrogation room. The male owner of house No. 35 was handcuffed to the chair by both his hands and feet. He struggled hard, but he couldn’t break free.

He was also covered in the evil force, so he was clearly violent.

“Let me go, let me go!” Once they came in, the man shouted, “I’m innocent. I didn’t kill…”

However, nobody paid attention to him.

“Have you done the interrogation?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“Not yet,” said Zhang Jingnan, because he decided to do it after Leng Shaoting came.

“Do it now. We’ll watch from the side,” said Leng Shaoting.

“Sure.” Zhang Jingnan replied, then began to interrogate the man.

“Name?” Zhang Jingnan asked.

“He Yuanhao,” said the man.

“Age?”

“Thirty-six.”

“Job?”

“Vice president of XX Group,” said He Yuanhao.

“Did you kill your wife?” Zhang Jingnan asked.

“No, not me. I didn’t…” Upon hearing that, He Yuanhao denied it emotionally.

“If it’s not you, why did you hang up on us and turn off your phone when we told you that we dug up a female corpse in your yard?” Zhang Jingnan asked.

Hearing that, He Yuanhao panicked a little. He felt guilty, but denied it again. “I didn’t turn off my phone. It was out of power…”

“Well, why didn’t you come back after hearing about the death of your wife?” asked Zhang Jingnan.

“I’m busy,” said He Yuanhao, but it wasn’t convincing.

“If you aren’t the murderer, didn’t you notice that someone had done something in your yard? Didn’t you notice that your wife had been absent for a week?” Zhang Jingnan asked.

“My yard is the same as before. How could I see the problem? My wife told me that she traveled abroad. It’s very normal that I can’t get through to her when she’s in a foreign country. I didn’t know that she was killed and buried in the yard!” He Yuanhao said and put on a sad face.

It sounded reasonable, but his reaction had already betrayed him. Even if he acted sad right now, it was too late. Anyway, his fear and anxiety were real, because he was really anxious and nervous.

If he was ready to face it, he wouldn’t have hung up on the police and run away when he received the police’s call and was told that they had dug out a female body from his yard. Unfortunately, he was still caught in the end.

He didn’t know whether he could get away with it this time, although he had turned to his connections for help. Hopefully, the person could help him out!

“You said your wife went to travel abroad. When did she leave the house?” Zhang Jingnan asked.

“In the afternoon six days ago,” said He Yuanhao.

“We’ve watched the surveillance videos. In the afternoon six days ago, your wife indeed left the house with a suitcase, but she came back at 8 pm. An hour later, you came home. Although the surveillance cameras are broken and the videos have been lost, the surveillance cameras by the road cover the area around the door and wall of your house. During this time, no stranger intruded in your home. Can you explain that?” Zhang Jingnan asked. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“I…” He Yuanhao was in complete panic now. Obviously, he was very guilty, but he still argued. “I don’t know. I didn’t kill her. I didn’t…”

Affected by the evil force, He Yuanhao was losing control of his emotions.

“He Yuanhao, why did you kill her?” Zhang Jingnan asked. Although He Yuanhao didn’t admit it yet, Zhang Jingnan was sure that he was the murderer.

Gu Ning, however, had seen the vision, so she was aware that He Yuanhao was guilty.

“You killed your wife.” At this moment, Gu Ning opened her mouth. Zhang Jingnan didn’t stop her, or feel dissatisfied.

“You and your wife argued on the landing. You pushed and pulled each other, then you pushed her down the stairs. She rolled down the stairs and knocked the back of her head against the ground. That’s how she died,” said Gu Ning.

“How did you know that?” He Yuanhao rounded his eyes in shock and unconsciously asked, exposing his dirty secret.

The next moment, He Yuanhao realized that he shouldn’t have said that aloud, so he immediately denied. “No, it’s not true. I didn’t…”

“Do you think we’ll believe you now?” Gu Ning sneered.

“I… I didn’t…” He Yuanhao kept on denying it, but his reaction told everyone that he was guilty.

“It’s you. You killed her.” Gu Ning became aggressive.

Being verbally attacked by Gu Ning, He Yuanhao couldn’t stay calm any longer and had a mental breakdown. “She deserved it. She betrayed me!”

Betrayal was hateful, but he shouldn’t have killed her just because of that. Besides, it was illegal.

“I didn’t do it on purpose. It was an accident. I didn’t mean to push her down the stairs…” He Yuanhao explained.

Gu Ning believed his reply, because she could see that from the vision. It was true that He Yuanhao accidentally pushed his wife down the stairs, but it was undeniable that he caused her death.

If he had reported himself for the crime and been accused of committing manslaughter at the time, the sentence would have been lighter. However, instead of reporting the crime, he buried the body, which made the consequences even more serious.

Because He Yuanhao admitted his crime, Gu Ning stopped arguing with him. The police would send him to court.

After that, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting left.

Although He Yuanhao was also affected by the evil force, it wasn’t too harmful to his health, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t pay much attention to it.

Zhang Jingnan walked Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting to their car in person.

When he walked back, he still heard other people talking about Gu Ning, so he asked, “Who is that Miss Gu? Why do you admire her so much?”

He understood that Miss Gu couldn’t be more influential than Leng Shaoting, but it aroused his curiosity when other people wouldn’t stop talking about her.
