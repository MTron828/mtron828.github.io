Chapter 2616: Can’t Wait to Die?

Therefore, if Senior Mrs. Jing wanted to stay, he would be happy.

“Well, since you already agreed to help, I should go now,” said Senior Mrs. Jing in a fit of pique.

If the evil cultivator didn’t want her to stay, she wouldn’t stay. After all, they weren’t a couple and didn’t meet often. They only had sex when they met.

“Why don’t you stay here for a few more days?” asked the evil cultivator with an evil smile on his lips. He deliberately asked that because he knew what Senior Mrs. Jing wanted to say. He wanted to tease her.

“Why?” Senior Mrs. Jing was pleased when he asked her that question, because it meant that he wanted her to stay. Although he didn’t make it very clear, it was pleasant enough.

“Since Jing Yaorong can’t satisfy your needs, won’t you feel sad if you leave without being completely satisfied?” said the evil cultivator. He didn’t bother to hide any longer.

“However, you must be willing to satisfy me first. If you’re not willing, I can’t stay. It’ll be embarrassing,” said Senior Mrs. Jing. Although she felt slightly embarrassed saying it aloud, she was indeed reluctant to leave right now.

“Of course I’m willing to,” said the evil cultivator, which filled Senior Mrs. Jing with excitement. It meant he wanted her to stay.

Therefore, Senior Mrs. Jing didn’t rush to go back home.

…

Jing Yaorong had no idea that his wife was sleeping with another man behind his back. She had been outside for four days, and was still gone, so he wondered whether she successfully met the evil cultivator.

If she couldn’t find the evil cultivator, what should they do?

After having lunch, the evil cultivator and Senior Mrs. Jing had sex again. The evil cultivator didn’t leave until 3 pm.

He had learned information about Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao from Senior Mrs. Jing, so now he left to find them.

The evil cultivator went to the Leng family’s house first, but both Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao were absent. Therefore he didn’t bother to hurt the other members of the Leng family, and directly went to the military base where Leng Shaoting’s team was staying.

Leng Shaoting was on vacation today, so he was actually in the capital alone.

On his way, he ran into the evil cultivator.

When the evil cultivator saw Leng Shaoting, he was slightly surprised, because Leng Shaoting wasn’t in the Golden Core Stage, but the Yuan Ying Period.

It turned out that Jing Yunyao’s son was really a talented cultivator. At such a young age, he had already reached the Yuan Ying Period.

Unfortunately, such a talented cultivator would be killed today.

As soon as Leng Shaoting saw the evil cultivator, he became alert, because he felt that this evil cultivator was at a higher level than him.

He was alert, but wasn’t scared, so he directly got out of his car and went to face the evil cultivator.

“Young man, you’re talented. At such a young age, you’ve already reached a high level.” The evil cultivator complimented. He was being very honest. After all, he had never seen anyone else reach the Yuan Ying Period at such a young age. However, it wouldn’t stop him from killing Leng Shaoting.

“Thank you for your compliment.” Leng Shaoting thanked him without any sincerity.

“Unfortunately… Such a talented cultivator will be destroyed today.” The evil cultivator seemed sorry, but he really wanted to kill Leng Shaoting.

“Do it now. No need to waste time!” said Leng Shaoting. Even though he didn’t have much confidence, he refused to be a coward.

“Oh, you can’t wait to die?” The evil cultivator sneered. Leng Shaoting could feel that he was stronger than him, but still dared to challenge him. He was so naive!

“Let’s see who will die in the end!” said Leng Shaoting coldly. Although he knew that the evil cultivator was stronger than him, he didn’t think that the evil cultivator was able to kill him.

“Fine, young man, since you can’t wait to die, I’ll make it reality!” said the evil cultivator. The next moment, he attacked Leng Shaoting. Given his level, he didn’t think that Leng Shaoting would be his match, especially because he was stronger.

If Jing Yunyao and Leng Shaoting fought against him together, he might have lost.

Because it was a battle between two high level cultivators, the trees around them were badly damaged.

Luckily, it was remote in the mountains, so no one was nearby.

In case anyone saw them, Leng Shaoting led the evil cultivator to a more remote place before they fought against each other.

The evil cultivator understood what Leng Shaoting wanted to do, but he said and did nothing.

He was targeting Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao this time, so he had no interest in unrelated people.

If anyone showed up suddenly, he would still kill him or her, to prevent the news from spreading. As a result, no matter who accidentally saw them, he or she had bad luck today

Leng Shaoting fought against the evil cultivator for twenty minutes, but he wasn’t at a disadvantage, which surprised the evil cultivator. At the same time, he also felt Leng Shaoting’s unbelievable explosive force.

However, only Leng Shaoting knew that he was losing strength.

When they went deeper in the mountains, Leng Shaoting let the flood dragon out. He wasn’t stupid and wouldn’t fight against the evil cultivator alone. It was obvious that he couldn’t win.

Although the flood dragon was weaker than the evil cultivator, there wasn’t a huge gap between them. Therefore the flood dragon would surely lose if it fought against the evil cultivator alone, but they could team up.

The evil cultivator didn’t expect to see a flood dragon with Leng Shaoting. There wasn’t a big gap between them, but this flood dragon wasn’t weak and was also in the Yuan Ying Period. So when the flood dragon teamed up with Leng Shaoting, the evil cultivator had to be careful.

Once the flood dragon joined Leng Shaoting, Leng Shaoting felt much more relaxed. However, it wasn’t easy for them to defeat the evil cultivator. After all, this evil cultivator was at a high level. He should be in the Out-of-body Stage.

The battle continued from the day to the night, but there was still no winner. Both sides had lost a lot of energy.

However, it was a battle of life and death, so no one was willing to stop.

Because Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao didn’t know that Leng Shaoting would be back today, they had no idea that he had run into the evil cultivator.
