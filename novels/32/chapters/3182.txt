The rest felt guilty, but they were sure that Leng Xiaoyao was one of Mu Yiyang’s team after hearing her words. However, they wanted to make sure of it, so they asked, “We have no grudge against you. Why did you want to catch us?”

“I don’t want to catch you, but my friends are searching for you. They fought with you today.” Leng Xiaoyao understood what they were thinking, so she directly told them the truth.

Although they guessed that it must have something to do with Mu Yiyang and his team, they still despaired after verifying it.

Once they were caught by Mu Yiyang, it would be impossible for them to run away.

“Damn it, I’ve been dragged into trouble by you!” The evil cultivator angrily criticized them. Saying that, he wanted to beat them, but was stopped by Leng Xiaoyao.

No matter how bad they were, Leng Xiaoyao would wait till Mu Yiyang came.

It was the truth, but those men didn’t think they were completely in the wrong. “We’re partners, so it’s your duty to rescue us. If we encounter any trouble, we should deal with it together. You can’t pin the blame on us!” One man argued.

“Right!” The other two men agreed. Although the evil cultivator was indeed dragged into trouble by them, they were partners, so they should bear the result whether they succeeded or failed.

If they failed and he escaped alone, they wouldn’t be able to accept it.

Especially the man who was grabbed by the evil cultivator and thrown to Leng Xiaoyao, he wanted the evil cultivator to suffer something worse.

Before long, Li Mochen came with Mu Yiyang and the others.

They knew that Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen would quickly catch them, but they were still surprised by their efficiency. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After Mu Yiyang and the others came, Leng Xiaoyao said, “You can take the three men, and leave this guy to me.”

The guy was the evil cultivator. He was seriously injured, but was still able to fight back, so he was a big threat to Mu Yiyang and the others. If Mu Yiyang tried to deal with him, he would be in trouble.

Since he was an evil cultivator, it was better for her to deal with him.

“Sure.” Mu Yiyang understood Leng Xiaoyao’s intention, so he agreed and immediately caught the three men.

Mu Yiyang’s teammates, who didn’t know that Leng Xiaoyao had special skills, were confused by her idea. Why was the man left to her?

However, Mu Yiyang already agreed, so they didn’t dare to say much. Even if they wanted to ask about it, they wouldn’t do that in front of Leng Xiaoyao.

“You can go out now. I’ll follow you later,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Of course.”

Li Mochen and the others replied and left first. Nobody asked about it because they knew that Leng Xiaoyao had special skills to deal with the man and she needed to avoid them.

Once Li Mochen and the others were gone, Leng Xiaoyao turned to stare at the evil cultivator. The evil cultivator was frightened and asked, “W-What do you want to do?”

“Do you have other partners?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

The evil cultivator wanted to deny it, but suddenly an idea dawned on him. If he told Leng Xiaoyao that he had other partners, she would spend time searching for them and put him aside. In that case, he would have more time to escape.

Therefore, the evil cultivator said, “Of course, and they’re very strong. If you dare to kill me, they’ll pay you back once they hear it.”

“Really? That’s what I want. I’m wondering how to catch your partners if you have any. It seems that I can do that by killing you! I guess I don’t need to keep you as bait,” Leng Xiaoyao said. When the evil cultivator was thinking about how to reply to her, she saw his intention from his eyes.

In fact, whether or not the evil cultivator had partners, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care. She would deal with them once they met, but she had no time to search for them. She wasn’t so free!

“No!” The evil cultivator realized that he was wrong and was scared. He wanted to change his answer, but didn’t know what to say. After all, Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t dumb and wouldn’t believe him.

“It’s not up to you,” Leng Xiaoyao said coldly. She was unwilling to waste time talking with the evil cultivator so she punished him at once.

Before long, the evil cultivator’s energy center was destroyed and he lost his abilities as a cultivator. As of today, he wouldn’t be able to get his skills back and it was totally up to his luck whether he could survive.

Even if he didn’t die, he would be useless and live a painful life. He would either live a hard life or kill himself after that.

When it was done, Leng Xiaoyao turned around and walked away, leaving the evil cultivator in the cave.

After Li Mochen’s people walked away, one of Mu Yiyang’s subordinates asked him, “Boss, why did you leave the man to the girl?”

“You saw how strange he was. We can’t take him back, or he might cause us trouble. We must deal with him separately. Anyway, he isn’t one of them, so there is no need to take him back,” Mu Yiyang said.

The others nodded.

However, the man was very strange, but they left him to a girl. It seemed that the girl had special abilities too.

The strange man already shocked them, and now Leng Xiaoyao, who had mysterious power, also showed up. It made them feel that this world was full of mysteries.

Because Leng Xiaoyao only used a minute to punish the evil cultivator, she caught up with Li Mochen and the others before they were even out of the cave.

“Xiaoyao, what did you do to the man?” Mu Yiyang asked curiously.

“He’s disabled and lost all of his abilities. It’s up to his luck whether he can survive,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Thank you so much for your help this time. Let me buy you a meal when you have time,” Mu Yiyang said.

“Sure!” Leng Xiaoyao accepted his invitation. After all, she had indeed done him a big favor. If she didn’t let him thank her with a meal, he might feel upset.

When they left after catching the suspects, Mu Yiyang and Li Mochen separated for the time being. Mu Yiyang and his team left to deal with the suspects, while Li Mochen and the others returned to the hotel.

The next day, the auction began at 10 am, but they could go inside at about 8 am because they needed to observe those raw jade materials two hours before the auction.
