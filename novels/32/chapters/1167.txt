Chapter 1168 Why Hurt Her?

Wu Sen understood what he could and couldn’t ask, so he didn’t ask Wan Chao whether he had offended someone recently.Wan Chao, on the other hand, was in a panic because he had no idea what had happened. He asked Wu Sen, but Wu Sen only told him that a girl called Miss Gu would come later.

Wan Chao knew that it couldn’t be good news, because Wu Sen took his phone away and personally guarded him here.

However, Wan Chao thought that he behaved normally, and he hadn’t annoyed anyone lately.

No matter how he reflected, he didn’t connect it with Lin Xiaoyu, because he believed that no one could find out what he had done to her. After all, it wasn’t the first time that he had done such a thing.

At this moment, someone knocked on the door. Wu Sen guessed that Gu Ning came, so he stood up at once to open the door.

“Hi, Manager Wu, Miss Gu is here,” the waiter said.

The second Wu Sen saw Gu Ning, he was impressed by her beauty, but he didn’t dare to flirt with her.

“Nice to meet you, Miss Gu. Please come in,” he said.

Although Wu Sen didn’t know Gu Ning, Chu Xuanfeng had told him that Gu Ning was a very beautiful young girl who was about 19 years old.

“Nice to meet you, Manager Wu,” Gu Ning said and walked inside.

“Miss Gu, I’ll stay outside. Please feel free to tell me if you need any help,” Wu Sen said.

He knew that it wasn’t appropriate for him to stay in the room, in case he saw something he shouldn’t see.

“Thanks,” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning also had no intention to let Wu Sen stay in the room, so it was better that he left by himself.

After that, Wu Sen walked out and closed the door.

Wan Chao was surprised by Gu Ning’s flawless face too, but he became nervous the next second. He didn’t know Gu Ning at all, and felt that it was very strange that Gu Ning wanted to see him alone. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“M-Miss Gu, may I know why you want to see me?” Wan Chao asked.

Gu Ning didn’t bother to waste time and said, “Were you involved in Lin Xiaoyu’s death?”

Even though Lin Xiaoyu blamed Wan Chao for everything, Gu Ning wanted to check it first to see whether it was the truth. Even a criminal should have the right to defend himself.

Hearing the name of Lin Xiaoyu, Wan Chao trembled in fear.

Gu Ning noticed his reaction, and she was sure now that Wan Chao was really involved in it.

To Wan Chao’s astonishment, Gu Ning came here because of Lin Xiaoyu, but he didn’t understand how Gu Ning found out about it.

“Miss Gu, why do you think that I’m involved in Xiaoyu’s death?” Wan Chao argued. He was unwilling to admit it right away.

“Am I wrong?” Gu Ning asked.

“Xiaoyu was my girlfriend, and we were in love. Why should I hurt her like that?” Wan Chao said and acted heart-broken.

Gu Ning sneered. “Because she caught you using and selling drugs. She wanted to break up with you, but you refused. You didn’t let her go until she threatened to call the police. In case she really called the police, you arranged for someone to rape and kill her before throwing her body into a river.”

Wan Chao was stunned. He believed that it was a secret between him and his close brothers. So how did Gu Ning manage to find out?

Because Wan Chao was too surprised, it was impossible for him to hide his reaction anymore.

“You...” He wanted to say something to defend himself, but didn’t know what to say.

“Am I right?” Gu Ning asked.

“No! It never happened!” Wan Chao retorted. He still believed that it was simply Gu Ning’s guess and Gu Ning didn’t have any proof.

“If not, why are you so nervous?” Gu Ning asked.

“I-I’m not,” Wan Chao said, although he was already sweating.

“Tell me, who did it for you?” Gu Ning put on a serious expression.

“I don’t know. It has nothing to do with me.” Wan Chao refused to tell the truth. He clearly knew that he would be put in jail if he admitted it.

“Do you think that you can get away with it?” Gu Ning cocked her eyebrow. “If you tell me who did it for you, they could probably share some punishment for you, and you’ll be lightly punished, or...”

Gu Ning didn’t finish the sentence, but her tone said everything.

Wan Chao lost control of his body and kept shaking in fear. His face already turned pale and looked frightened.

He understood that Gu Ning wasn’t just threatening him, and that it was very likely to happen.

He was a member of the Qing Gang, and there were many ways to punish a person in an illegal gang.

The punishment could be very cruel and he wouldn’t be protected by the law.
