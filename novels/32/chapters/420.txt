Chapter 421 An Official Meeting Between Father And Daughter

Tang Haifeng wanted to stop them, because fighting wasn’t a good thing, and he was worried that they could get hurt, but since both of them agreed, he couldn’t do anything about it, so he just reminded them to be careful. “Do be careful!”

“I will!” Cao Wenxin gave her grandpa a perfunctory answer then ran to the yard, pulling Gu Ning followed by Tang Jiakai.

Tang Haifeng also followed them walking outside.

In the yard, Cao Wenxin and Gu Ning stood across from each other, while Tang Haifeng and Tang Jiakai stood three meters away.

Cao Wenxin asked, “Are you ready?”

“I’m ready,” Gu Ning said. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Great, let’s begin!” Cao Wenxin said, and attacked Gu Ning at once. She wasn’t sure about Gu Ning’s strength, so she only used a third of her strength in case Gu Ning would be hurt. Facing Cao Wenxin, Gu Ning didn’t bother to use much strength either.

Domestic servants in the Tang family all went ahead to watch the game. In the beginning, they thought that Gu Ning had annoyed Cao Wenxin. However, since Tang Jiakai and Tang Haifeng were watching too, they understood that it was just to practice.

After a few movements, seeing that Gu Ning wasn’t weak at all, Cao Wenxin started to attack heavily.

Cao Wenxin was good at fighting, but was still barely comparable to Gu Ning. Gu Ning could beat the top Special Forces after all, and Cao Wenxin was merely as strong as a common soldier. Therefore, no matter how heavily she attacked Gu Ning, Gu Ning could easily get control of her. When Cao Wenxin used her full strength, but still failed to gain any advantage in the competition, she understood that she was hardly an opponent for Gu Ning.

Cao Wenxin didn’t want to give up, so she persisted.

Right at this moment, a black Bentley moved into the gate of the Tang family. It was Tang Yunfan’s car.

Once the car entered the gate, Tang Yunfan noticed the two girls who were fighting against each other. Even though Gu Ning was moving quickly, he still recognized her at first glance. Seeing Gu Ning, Tang Yunfan was struck dumb. It’s her! Why is she here?

Tang Yunfan’s mood was affected when Gu Ning appeared in his sight, and he didn’t know why either. Seeing that they were fighting, he couldn’t help worrying about Gu Ning even though Gu Ning had the advantage. Tang Yunfan didn’t understand that it was because of their blood connection.

Gu Ning sensed Tang Yunfan’s gaze and also saw him. Although it was Tang Aining’s soul in Gu Ning’s body, she had a strange feeling while facing Gu Ning’s biological father. In her previous incarnation, Tang Aining’s father was a totally evil person who had betrayed her mother and made her mother lie in a vegetative state. She also had to follow her father’s orders, risking her life and do bad things for the sake of her mother’s life. She couldn’t change what had already happened, but she could get revenge. She made up her mind to completely unseat that Tang family.

Thinking of that, Gu Ning’s emotions were affected, and she accidentally hit Cao Wenxin’s left shoulder with great force and Cao Wenxin’s left shoulder was dislocated.

Cao Wenxin felt hurt, but she didn’t shout in pain, because she had often been injured throughout the years of training kung fu.

Everyone was shocked by the accident, including Gu Ning. She immediately walked to Cao Wenxin and said, “I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean it.” Saying that, she pulled Cao Wenxin’s left arm and moved the shoulder back to its normal position.

“It’s fine.” Cao Wenxin didn’t mind, because she knew that Gu Ning didn’t mean to hurt her. And it was unavoidable to be hurt in a fight.

“Are you alright?” Tang Jiakai and Tang Haifeng ran to them and asked worriedly.

“I’m fine. It’s unavoidable to get hurt in a fight.” Cao Wenxin explained, because she didn’t want others to blame Gu Ning. Tang Haifeng and Tang Jiakai understood that, and nobody blamed Gu Ning.

“Gu Ning, I failed,” Cao Wenxin said. “However, you’re really awesome! Do you have a kung fu master as your teacher or something?”

Gu Ning smiled. “Yes!”

“Really?” Cao Wenxin was surprised. “What does she do? Can I meet her?”

“She passed away last year,” Gu Ning said and looked sad.

“What?” Cao Wenxin was shocked. “I’m sorry. I...”

“It’s fine. You didn’t know.” Gu Ning didn’t mind.

Meanwhile, Tang Yunfan walked to them, and his sight fell on Gu Ning once in a while.

“Yunfan! Come here. Let me introduce you!” Tang Yunfan said, and pulled Gu Ning to Tang Yunfan’s side. “This is my new granddaughter, Gu Ning.”

When Tang Yunfan stood with Gu Ning, Tang Haifeng thought the two really resembled each other so much. He sighed and said, “Well, I just can’t help noticing that you two closely resemble each other.”

Hearing that, Tang Yunfan looked at Gu Ning’s face, and he was distracted a little. Cao Wenxin also glanced between Tang Yunfan and Gu Ning. She had the same idea.

“It’s true!” Cao Wenxin said with surprise. Although Tang Haifeng had told her that Gu Ning greatly resembled a young Tang Yunfan, she had been too young at that time, so she didn’t have much of an impression. However, when Tang Yunfan and Gu Ning appeared at the same time, their features were very alike.

“Indeed! If uncle were married, I would believe that Gu Ning is uncle’s daughter,” Tang Jiakai said.

Daughter? Hearing the word, Tang Yunfan had a strange feeling, and he felt an increasingly growing intimacy towards Gu Ning, which made himself think that maybe there was a connection between Gu Ning and him.

“Grandpa, is Gu Ning your Illegitimate daughter?” Cao Wenxin suddenly had a wild guess.

“Are you insane!” Tang Haifeng hit Cao Wenxin with his crutch, but Cao Wenxin quickly moved away.

“I’m just kidding!” Cao Wenxin argued.

“Do you think that it’s funny?” Tang Haifeng was mad.

Cao Wenxin also realized that she shouldn’t have said that, so she remained quiet afterwards.
