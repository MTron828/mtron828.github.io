2934 Don’t Be Silent

However, after the police came and searched around, they found nothing.

That being the case, Wei Youwei had to give up.

…

In the morning, Gu Ning made a copy of all the criminal evidence, then left the Tang family’s house and mailed the copy to Tang Yunhang. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Because they were in the same city, Tang Yunhang received the package at about 4 pm.

Once he received the package, Tang Yunhang opened it. After making sure it was the evidence of Wei Youwei’s crimes, he immediately went to Wei Youwei’s office to see him.

Because of what had happened at his home that morning, Wei Youwei was anxious all day, then all of a sudden, Tang Yunhang visited him.

“Secretary Tang, may I help?” Wei Youwei asked. Although they were enemies, they still needed to be polite on the surface.

However, Wei Youwei was upset that he failed to scheme against Tang Yunhang. He probably wouldn’t dare to do it again during this time, in case he was exposed, but he was nervous since Tang Yunhang suddenly came.

Even though he dared to murder Tang Yunhang, it didn’t mean that he wasn’t scared of him.

He was actually in awe of Tang Yunhang and the Tang family, but money came with danger. If he didn’t get rid of powerful opponents, he couldn’t be promoted to a more important position.

And he was fully-prepared when he decided to carry out his plan. He believed that he wouldn’t be exposed.

“Secretary Wei, I just received an anonymous file. It reports that you’ve accepted bribes which is worth over a hundred million yuan. Can you explain that?” Tang Yunhang asked, throwing the file on the table in front of Wei Youwei.

Wei Youwei was stunned. Looking at the file on the table, he couldn’t believe his eyes.

He didn’t open the file yet, so he wasn’t sure whether it was really the evidence of his crimes, but Tang Yunhang seemed very confident.

Who reported him?

“Secretary Tang, are you sure? I’ve been reported?” Wei Youwei didn’t pick the file up right away. He still hoped that he might have good luck and thought that it might be a trap. If he hurriedly picked up the file, he might look guilty.

“Secretary Wei, why don’t you have a look by yourself? You can verify it before you take the next step,” Tang Yunhang said meaningfully.

Hearing that, Wei Youwei immediately picked it up. He was full of horror, because he somehow had a feeling that it was really the evidence of his crimes. Otherwise Tang Yunhang wouldn’t come to see him.

The moment he read the first page, his hands shook and his body stiffened. He was completely shocked.

It wasn’t other people’s stuff, it was his own notebook!

How was that possible? Why did it show up here? Didn’t he hide it away well? How was it found?

And it wasn’t the original file, it was just a copy, which meant the person who reported him had the original file.

“Secretary Wei, do you know what this is?” Tang Yunhang asked.

“I don’t know who sent this to you. The handwriting on it looks the same as mine, but it isn’t mine. After all, it’s not difficult to copy someone’s handwriting.” Wei Youwei denied. Although he understood that it would be hard for him to get out of this since Tang Yunhang had the evidence, he was unwilling to admit it right away.

“Really? But the whistleblower took a video and it was found in your study. If it’s not yours, you really shouldn’t carry the blame. Why don’t we inform the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection? We can go to your home to make sure of it,” Tang Yunhang said. He didn’t argue with Wei Youwei, but gave an idea.

It was true that Gu Ning took a video when she found the evidence, but she didn’t film when she moved the bookshelves away with her magical energy, because it would shock people.

Wei Youwei was silent. Furious, he had no idea what to do right now. He hated the person who dared to take it out of his study, but how did the person know the evidence was hidden in his study? Even his family didn’t know.

Wei Youwei remembered that the gate of his house was broken this morning. In that case, it had to be related to the lost evidence, but it was really unbelievable that the person easily stole his notebooks without leaving any traces.

Moreover, did it have something to do with Tang Yunhang? Did Tang Yunhang really receive an anonymous mail, or was it his plan?

Wei Youwei’s guess was the truth, but he didn’t think it was possible.

“Secretary Wei, why are you silent?” Tang Yunhang asked.

“Secretary Tang, what do you want to do?” Wei Youwei asked.

“Secretary Wei, what do you mean by saying that? Since you’ve been reported for accepting bribes, as the General Secretary of City B, I have the responsibility to investigate it,” Tang Yunhang explained.

“Will you do that every time someone makes fake evidence? If there is nothing illegal at my home, your actions will damage my reputation. Not everyone will believe that I’m innocent,” Wei Youwei said, reluctant to give in.

“Secretary Wei, you’re not dumb. As a senior official, I think you can handle it very well. Whether the evidence is true or not, the handwriting on it is yours. I also have a video to prove that it was found in your study. Given that, I have enough reason to conduct an investigation. If you don’t want me to do that, I can hand it to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection,” Tang Yunhang said. He didn’t need to deal with it in person, he simply came over because he received the file.

Once he finished speaking, Tang Yunhang turned around and walked away.

Wei Youwei completely panicked. He realized that he couldn’t avoid the investigation this time because the evidence was directly mailed to Tang Yunhang instead of his people.

What should he do now? Did he have to allow himself to get caught, but how could he change the result?

He wanted to call his family to tell them to fill the hole if they were home.
