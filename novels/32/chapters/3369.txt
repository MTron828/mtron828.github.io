Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Although he knew about Wang Xiangyang’s conspiracy, Wang Yiming still felt a wave of fear when he heard that his daughter was missing.

His wife almost fainted.

The others were unaware of the secret, so when they heard the news, they were worried and immediately went out to search for the little girl.

Wang Xiangyang needed evidence for his alibi, so he pretended to be worried like everyone else.

Before long, Wang Yiming received a strange call saying that his daughter was in their hands and that he needed to pay a hundred thousand yuan to get her released. He was forbidden to call the police, otherwise they would kill his daughter.

When the money was ready, he was supposed to call them back, and they would tell him where to make the exchange.

To make Wang Yiming believe them, they even had his daughter call him and say “daddy” on the phone.

Despite knowing that Leng Xiaoyao was secretly protecting them, Wang Yiming was still really worried and panicked.

After learning that Wang Yiming’s daughter was kidnapped, Old Mrs. Wang and Zhao Shanchuan’s family were all terrified.

Zhao Shanchuan wanted to help, but didn’t know how. Wang Yiming didn’t want his help and said he would listen to the kidnappers. Without delay, he went home to get the money.

It was already evening, and the bank was closed. The ATM had a daily withdrawal limit of only ten thousand yuan, so to make Wang Xiangyang believe that he could get the money so quickly, he said before leaving, “There is over a hundred thousand yuan in cash at home that I haven’t had time to deposit. I’ll go get it now.”

After learning about Wang Xiangyang’s scheme, Wang Yiming did indeed withdraw a hundred thousand yuan, which he had prepared for today.

When Wang Xiangyang heard that, he wasn’t worried that Wang Yiming was deceiving him.

In a place where no one could see, Wang Xiangyang’s expression revealed his satisfaction.

He would soon have a hundred thousand yuan.

To be precise, it was fifty thousand yuan because the rest had to be given to Brother Liu and his brothers.

Although he didn’t want to give them anything, he wouldn’t get anything either if he didn’t share the money with them.

As a result, he agreed to give them fifty thousand yuan.

Wang Yiming and his wite did go home tor a while, but when they came out, only Wang Yiming was present.

After returning home, Wang Yiming told his wife the truth. It helped calm her down from almost crying in fear.

She didn’t blame him for taking the risk because if he didn’t take the risk, they would have to live in fear every day. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

This time, they had to completely solve the problem of Wang Xiangyang.

Wang Yiming left with the money and instructed his wife to lock all the doors and windows at home and to not open them for anyone unless he returned.

They also couldn’t tell their father-in-law’s family about this incident in order to not worry them.

After receiving the money, Wang Yiming called the kidnappers back and they asked him to send a picture first to confirm.

Once confirmed, they told him where to make the exchange.

The location was an abandoned warehouse in the suburbs. They had just arrived when Leng Xiaoyao followed them.

Before they could react, she took them down quickly.

Her appearance was too sudden and her attack too fast, so they didn’t even have a chance to react. By the time they came back to their senses, they only felt pain all over and couldn’t move.

“W-Who are you?” said the so-called Brother Liu.

“I am your nemesis, ” said Leng Xiaoyao with a smile as beautiful as a flower, but in those men’s eyes, she was a demon.

Before they started fighting, they didn’t even take the girl seriously, but after being beaten by her, they petrified.

“I-It’s none of your business,” Brother Liu said fiercely.

“So what? If you have the guts, try to stop me!” Leng Xiaoyao said disdainfully.

Wang Yiming’s child had already fainted. Leng Xiaoyao immediately went over to check on her to make sure that she was okay.

Waiting for Wang Yiming and the police to arrive, Leng Xiaoyao carried the girl in her arms.

When Wang Yiming came, he reported it to the police, so he and the police arrived at around the same time.

Wang Yiming didn’t mention Leng Xiaoyao, so Leng Xiaoyao would pretend to be a kind passer-by.

Twenty minutes later, Wang Yiming arrived in a police car.

The police were going to let Wang Yiming go in first with the money, then they would follow him, but when they got closer, they saw a girl holding a child coming out.

Without hesitation, Wang Yiming ran over.

The police who came to the scene didn’t know that Leng Xiaoyao was on their side, so they were angry at Wang Yiming’s behavior. What he did could alert those kidnappers and put the girl in danger.

However, they quickly figured it out.

“Mr. Wang, what are you doing here?” Leng Xiaoyao pretended to be surprised and asked.

“M-My daughter was kidnapped. This is my daughter…” Wang Yiming said emotionally. Even though he believed in Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities, he still cried in excitement when he saw that his daughter was fine.

“Oh, so this is your daughter! I saw a group of people dragging this child into a car, so I followed them,” Leng Xiaoyao said, then handed Wang Yiming’s daughter to him.

When the police heard that, they were all surprised that Leng Xiaoyao had rescued the hostage from the kidnappers.

“Sir, I beat the kidnappers. They’re inside,” Leng Xiaoyao immediately said.

Hearing that, everyone was once again surprised.

She had beaten all the kidnappers?

They rushed in and saw that all four men were lying on the ground. They immediately arrested them.

Since Leng Xiaoyao was involved in this abduction, she needed to go back to the police station with them to give a statement. After recording her statement, Leng Xiaoyao was free to go.

Because Leng Xiaoyao drove there, she gave Wang Yiming and his daughter a ride home. By the time they arrived home, Wang Yiming’s daughter woke up and cried herself to sleep.

After sending Wang Yiming and his daughter home, the couple were very grateful to Leng Xiaoyao.

Meanwhile, those people who were in trouble naturally wouldn’t help Wang Xiangyang any longer. They immediately reported him to the police.

Therefore, Wang Xiangyang was immediately arrested.

Wang Xiangyang denied it, but before the police arrested him, they investigated the evidence and found that he had been in and out with the suspects several times.

There were several records of phone calls too.

These were enough to take Wang Yiming back to the police station. For more details, they would continue to investigate.

When Old Mrs. Wang learned that Wang Yiming’s daughter had been kidnapped by Wang Xiangyang, she couldn’t accept it and fainted.

Fortunately, Zhao Shanchuan’s family hadn’t left yet, or no one would stay and take care of Old Mrs. Wang.

Zhao Shanchuan was extremely angry at Wang Xiangyang’s behavior and slapped him twice on the spot while scolding him as trash.

This time, Wang Xiangyang would have to spend several years in prison..
