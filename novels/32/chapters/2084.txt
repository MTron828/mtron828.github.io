Chapter 2085: Do You Dare?

There were a few people after Gu Ning, but they didn’t have good results, so Leng Shaoting ranked first, Gu Ning ranked second, the cultivator in the Golden Core Stage with nine magic crystals ranked third, Jing Yunyan ranked fourth, Dongfang Ziyu and the disciple of Tiandaozong ranked fifth, another cultivator in the Golden Core Stage ranked sixth, Mo Qilin ranked seventh, Yin Ruyan ranked eighth in the end, and Baili Zongxue ranked tenth.

All the members of the four major families were on the list. In fact, they were at a great advantage, because their teammates were arranged by their families and wouldn’t betray them. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

However, other participants had to team up ad hoc, so they betrayed each other at the end of the game and began to compete against each other. As a result, each of them could only get a small amount of magic crystals, so they naturally couldn’t win a prize.

After the prize-winners were released, they all got their awards and the magic crystals they got were owned by themselves.

Many people were jealous of Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning, but they could do nothing about it.

Some people wanted to buy magic crystals from them, but were all turned down no matter how much they were willing to pay.

Anyway, given Leng Shaoting’s current level, only magic crystals above the fifth level were useful for him, so he didn’t need magic crystals blew the fifth level.

Gu Ning needed magic crystals above the third level, so she gave those at the first and second level to Mo Qilin.

She also gave a few at the third, fourth, and fifth level to him.

They gave Mo Qilin those magic crystals and Mo Qilin could decide how to use them. He could take them all as his own, or share them with other members in Tiandaozong. He alone didn’t need so many magic crystals after all.

Because Gu Ning gave him too many magic crystals, Mo Qilin felt embarrassed to take them, but Gu Ning said that they didn’t need so many and they would dump those useless magic crystals if he didn’t take them.

Since Gu Ning said that, Mo Qilin took the magic crystals and felt very grateful to Gu Ning.

Other people were jealous of him. If Gu Ning didn’t need those magic crystals, they were willing to take them! Unfortunately, they weren’t familiar with Gu Ning, so Gu Ning wouldn’t give them.

Magic crystals were useful for cultivation, but one couldn’t make huge progress just with the help of magic crystals. It still depended on one’s talent and luck. Anyway, they were very helpful.

After the competition was over, the participants left. Shangguan Yang and the others along with members of the four major families stayed for the dinner arranged by Tiandaozong.

Walking to the side hall, Jing Yunyan looked at Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning with strong hatred. A touch of unkindness flashed in Gu Ning’s eyes.

“Senior Qing, I need to leave for a while. I’ll be back soon,” said Gu Ning to Leng Shaoting. They were in public, so she could only call Leng Shaoting Senior Qing.

When Leng Shaoting noticed the unkindness in Gu Ning’s eyes, he knew that she was going to do something bad, but he didn’t stop her. He responded to her and let her go.

Gu Ning then walked towards Jing Yunyan, looking at him with a vague smile.

Seeing Gu Ning walking over, Jing Yunyan hid his real feelings, but still looked cold.

Why is this woman coming over? She has an insincere smile on her face. It can’t be good news.

Anyway, he didn’t avoid it and wanted to see what Gu Ning was going to do.

If he avoided it, it would seem that he was scared of her, which was quite humiliating and Jing Yunyan wouldn’t do that. Therefore, he put on his pride at once to face Gu Ning.

Many people around him saw Gu Ning walking to Jing Yunyan, so they stopped to watch. Because many of them could see Jing Yunyan’s hatred towards Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting, they thought that Gu Ning was going to cause trouble.

“Lord Jing, are you mad at me and my Senior Qing? Why do you always look at us with hatred?” said Gu Ning calmly. It sounded as if she wasn’t annoyed at all.

She wasn’t mad, but she deliberately came to annoy Jing Yunyan.

When other people heard Gu Ning’s words, they realized that this girl called Qing He was indeed going to cause trouble for Jing Yunyan.

“Well, I think you know the answer clearly.” Jing Yunyan snorted. He sounded very unkind.

Hearing that, people got curious. What had happened that made Jing Yunyan hate them so much? Was it because they had shown up and won the first and second prize?

It seemed to be so, but could be more than just that.

“Do you mean what happened in the misty forest? Isn’t it very normal?” Gu Ning laughed a little, then mocked him. “Lord Jing, are you carrying a grudge against me and my Senior Qing just because of that?”

Jing Yunyan coldly stared at Gu Ning without a word.

“Lord Jing, if you’re unwilling to accept it, you can go challenge my Senior Qing. If you win, we’ll give the fifth-level magic crystal back to you. How about that?” said Gu Ning. She had no intention of hiding the fact that they had robbed Jing Yunyan of a fifth-level magic crystal.

It was allowed to rob other people of magic crystals, but it was humiliating that Jing Yunyan failed to protect his magic crystal and was robbed of it by Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning said he could challenge Jing Yunyan, which was another humiliation to him, because obviously Jing Yunyan was no match for Leng Shaoting. If he went to challenge Leng Shaoting, he would be seeking humiliation on his own.

Although Jing Yunyan had nothing to do with what Jing Yunyao had suffered, he was Jing Yaorong’s son after all and he was very hateful.

“You…”

Even though Jing Yunyan was robbed of the magic crystal, he had no intention of saying it aloud, because it was humiliating that he was robbed of the magic crystal. However, now Gu Ning said it out loud, so Jing Yunyan was very angry.

Besides, Gu Ning publicly humiliated him again by urging him to challenge Leng Shaoting. He was no match for Leng Shaoting!

Other people around them immediately learned that Jing Yunyan hated Shangguan Yang’s disciples very much because they had robbed him of a fifth-level magic crystal.

Everyone would be mad if he or she was robbed of magic crystals, but it was indeed embarrassing that Jing Yunyan couldn’t defeat them.

All of a sudden, Jing Yunyan sneered and mocked. “Oh, do you want to bully me by telling me to challenge a cultivator who’s at a higher level than me? Do you dare to compete against me?”

“Why not?” Gu Ning replied fearlessly and challenged him. “I don’t care about the fact that your level is higher than mine, I’m just afraid that you might be displeased when other people say you’re bullying me.”

Hearing Gu Ning’s words, everyone felt she was too arrogant because she wasn’t very strong compared with Jing Yunyan.

However, when Gu Ning finished, they believed she wasn’t really going to compete against Jing Yunyan. She dared to say that only because she was sure that Jing Yunyan wouldn’t bully cultivators at a lower level than him.
