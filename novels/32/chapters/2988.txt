Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care that they chose to trust Chu Jianan. She moved her foot away from Fang Haoming’s body, then two men immediately came over to help him up.

“I have no interest in stirring things up among you, but I have to remind you to be careful from now on. If you behave and stay away from me, I can forgive you for humiliating me, but if you dare to mess with me, be prepared to pay for it. You should have seen my skills. Don’t cry to your families if you are beaten by me. It’ll only make you cowards,” Leng Xiaoyao warned.

Although they had humiliated Leng Xiaoyao many times before, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t bother to hold a grudge against them for that. Anyway, it was just verbal abuse, and she didn’t suffer a big loss, but if they dared to mess with her, she wouldn’t hesitate to teach them a lesson.

“Leng Xiaoyao, don’t be so arrogant!” One man was furious. Although he was scared of Leng Xiaoyao’s skills and didn’t dare to fight with her, he hated that Leng Xiaoyao was so aggressive.

!!

“So what? If you don’t like it, challenge me!” Leng Xiaoyao became even more arrogant, which made them furious.

“You…” They didn’t want to give in, but they didn’t dare to challenge Leng Xiaoyao.

Right at that moment, a lazy male voice sounded. “Oh, is there an issue? I’m only a few minutes late. Did I miss it?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Hearing that, everyone turned to look at the man. It was a handsome young man who was about twenty-four years old.

There were two other men with him who were also good-looking. It was obvious that they were rich second-generation heirs.

“Hi, uncle!” Xiong Manxin’s eyes lit up once she saw the man.

He was Xiong Manxin’s younger uncle, Ling Tianqi.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t just arrive. He had arrived earlier on, so he didn’t miss the drama and was amazed by Leng Xiaoyao’s skills.

Ling Tianqi had heard of Leng Xiaoyao, but had never seen her in reality. Now, at their first meeting, he was amazed by her.

He had heard that she was an arrogant and stupid good-for-nothing, but she didn’t seem like that now that he saw her.

Leng Xiaoyao was obviously confident and charming!

Although she was arrogant, she had the ability to be.

She had freckles on her face, which was ugly, but she had delicate features. Without those freckles, she would be a great beauty.

However, even though she had freckles, it wasn’t a big deal. They could easily be covered by make-up.

And if she wanted to remove them, it wasn’t difficult.

Although not all the freckles could be removed, she could get rid of most of them.

“Little Panda, is this your boss? She’s very strong. You made the right choice.” Even though Ling Tianqi recognized Leng Xiaoyao, he still asked about her identity.

Xiong Manxin was extremely excited when her younger uncle complimented her boss. “Right, she’s my boss. She’s definitely awesome!”

“Nice to meet you, Miss Leng. I’m Manxin’s uncle, Ling Tianqi.” Ling Tianqi greeted Leng Xiaoyao.

“Nice to meet you too, Mr. Ling.” Leng Xiaoyao replied politely.

Afterwards, Ling Tianqi turned to look at Chu Jianan and his friends. “Hi, Mr. Chu, Mr. Qiu, and Mr. Fang.”

Ling Tianqi greeted Chu Jianan and his friends, but not sincerely.

They were members of high society, so they would be polite to each other on the surface no matter how they actually got along in private. It was necessary for them to keep a good reputation.

They wouldn’t be impolite unless there were grudges between them.

“Nice to see you, Mr. Ling, Mr. Pei, and Mr. Feng.”

Chu Jianan and his friends greeted Ling Tianqi and his friends too.

“Hi, Mr. Chu, Mr. Qiu, Mr. Fang, and Mr. Yu.” Ling Tianqi’s two friends also said hi.

“It’s time for the race now. Why don’t we go inside?” Ling Tianqi said to Xiong Manxin and Leng Xiaoyao.

“Sure!” Xiong Manxin and Leng Xiaoyao agreed.

“Alright, we need to go inside now. I think you should send Mr. Fang to the hospital as soon as possible,” Ling Tianqi said, but he didn’t look worried or sympathetic. Instead, he gloated over their misfortune.

Chu Jianan and his friends said nothing. After all, Ling Tianqi was very polite on the surface. If they argued with him, they would be the ones who were rude in other people’s eyes.

“We know. Thanks for caring, Mr. Ling,” Chu Jianan said.

After that, Ling Tianqi and the others left.

Watching them walking away, Chu Jianan and his friends were angry, but they couldn’t do anything about it. After all, they couldn’t defeat them in a fight, and they had to send Fang Haoming to the hospital.

“Leng Xiaoyao, I promise I’ll pay you back!” Fang Haoming angrily vowed at Leng Xiaoyao’s back.

“It’s not easy to deal with Leng Xiaoyao. If you really want to pay her back, you must hide yourself well, or she’ll pay you back instead.” Chu Jianan reminded him to be careful. He couldn’t wait to see Leng Xiaoyao punished, but didn’t want to do that himself. He didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to pay him back if he was exposed.

Therefore, before he could think of a good solution, he wouldn’t take action.

If Fang Haoming wanted to, he would watch from the side.

“Don’t worry, I’m not dumb,” Fang Haoming said. He wouldn’t swallow the humiliation, and was determined to teach Leng Xiaoyao a lesson.

He wouldn’t do it on his own, nor would he expose himself if he was going to pay someone to do it for him.

…

After Leng Xiaoyao and the others walked away, Ling Tianqi introduced his friends to her. “Miss Leng, let me introduce you, these two are my friends. This is Mr. Pei, Pei Heran, and this is Mr. Feng, Feng Rui.”

The Pei family was a rich family in City Chang, while the Feng family was a family of power. Feng Rui’s father was the mayor of City Chang.

Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao politely greeted them. “Nice to see you, Mr. Pei, and Mr. Feng.”

“No need to be so polite to us. You can call us Brother Heran and Brother Rui like Manxin,” Pei Henran said. He was easy to get along with.
