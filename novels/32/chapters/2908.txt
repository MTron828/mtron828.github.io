2910 You’re Useless!

“But the fog here is too thick. I don’t dare to drive faster.” the driver answered.

“They dare to. Why can’t you do the same? You’re useless!” Their leader was mad. He couldn’t blame Leng Shaoting, so he vented his anger on the man who was driving the yacht.

The man was aggrieved, but said nothing. He immediately sped up and soon saw Leng Shaoting and the others.

In fact, as long as they drove as fast as Leng Shaoting, there wouldn’t be any problem.

Twenty minutes later, they finally got out of the thick fog, which surprised everyone. They didn’t expect to leave it so quickly.

When they were out, Leng Shaoting drove at an extremely high speed, leaving them behind. He didn’t care what would happen to them afterwards.

“How did they get in and out so easily? Did they find the treasure?” An idea dawned on one man.

They wouldn’t believe it if Leng Shaoting told them that they had found the treasure earlier, but now they began to think it was possible.

“I don’t think so. It’s so hard to find the treasure,” another man replied.

“It’s hard, but it doesn’t mean it’s impossible. They didn’t seem disappointed at all when they said they failed to find the treasure,” one man pointed out.

“Do you mean they have found the treasure?”

“Whether they found it or not, catch up with them now!” their leader ordered. He was unwilling to accept the result without knowing the truth.

They weren’t grateful for Leng Shaoting’s help. On the contrary, they decided to scheme against them.

Without delay, they sped up.

Unfortunately, Leng Shaoting and the others were already far away, and they drove very fast. It was impossible for the yacht which was left behind to catch up to them.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting noticed their change. They were displeased, and felt that they shouldn’t have helped them.

They couldn’t receive a signal until they were far away from the island, at which time Gano saw several missed calls from his grandfather.

His grandfather understood that there wasn’t any signal after they went further into the sea, but he still called Gano because of his worry.

Gano immediately called his grandfather back, even though it was already 2 am.

Gano’s grandfather was astonished to hear that they had found and retrieved the treasure smoothly. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He understood that Gano couldn’t have done it alone because he knew his grandson’s abilities very well. Therefore, he was amazed by the skills of the people who went with Gano.

They were so strong that Gano’s grandfather was worried that they would keep the treasure for themselves.

However, he didn’t ask about that, because Leng Shaoting might hear them and get mad. If they got angry, they might really keep the treasure for themselves.

When Gu Ning and the others were back at the shore, the group of people was still far behind. They had totally lost Leng Shaoting.

Because of that, those people were angry.

After the yacht stopped by the shore, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting carried their stuff and returned to their house. Gano and Billy also went home.

When Gano and Billy were alone, Gano called his grandfather again. Although his grandfather didn’t ask much about their adventure, he understood that his grandfather was worried.

Therefore, he told his grandfather what they had been through, and his grandfather was relieved.

In fact, the Tilar family didn’t lack money, but Gano wanted to go on an adventure, so his grandfather allowed him to do so.

In addition, no one would say no to getting more money.

…

Back in the house.

Leng Shaoting gave everything to Gu Ning and she put it in her telepathic eye space.

“Are you tired?” Leng Shaoting asked with concern.

“Not at all,” Gu Ning replied.

“Great, then let’s take a shower and go to bed,” Leng Shaoting said. Then he pulled Gu Ning and walked to the bedroom.

That night, they didn’t have sex. Although she said she wasn’t tired, he still wanted her to have a good rest, so he hugged her to sleep.

…

The next morning, Gano and Billy went to the beach outside Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s house. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting met them again when they went for a walk.

They came to invite Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting to share a meal. They had already shared the treasure and Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting got more, but they wouldn’t have gotten any without Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s help. Therefore, they felt that they should buy Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting a meal to thank them.

Anyway, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting needed to eat, so they accepted the invitation.

And the restaurant wasn’t far away.

Gu Ning had eaten seafood for days, but she could never have enough. Therefore, after asking for her opinion, they decided to have seafood.

Two more days later, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went home.

Everything was fine in the capital, and their wedding photos had already been sent to the studio for editing, so by the time Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were back, the wedding photos were done. They took the photos back and placed them in their house at Mid-Levels Mansion.

Leng Shaoting decided to use the house at Mid-Levels Mansion as their wedding house. Because he had many houses, there was no need to buy a new one. He was rich, but he wouldn’t just waste money.

Moreover, he bought the house at Mid-Levels Mansion only a few years ago. He rarely stayed there, so it was basically new.

Leng Shaoting only stayed in the capital for one day, then went back to their military base.

As for their wedding, the senior generation would make the arrangements. There was nothing for Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting to be worried about. They only needed to provide their preferences.

Gu Ning decided to listen to her family since she didn’t want to do all the things by herself.

Anyway, Jing Yunyao and the others would give her the best. She would receive the best treatment.

When Chu Peihan and the others heard that Gu Ning was back, they asked her out for a meal.

However, Chu Peihan was popular now, so she had fans and haters. Some haters even swore at her.

As a result, accidents sometimes happened.

Because Chu Peihan didn’t live in the school and had bought her own house, she lived outside now.
