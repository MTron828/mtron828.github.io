912 Wan Baojie

No matter how fiercely they argued, no one stood out to mediate. Even the restaurant owner watched from the side with a cold face.

When those local citizens became more and more offensive, both Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were annoyed. As a soldier who served his country, Leng Shaoting wouldn’t tolerate the humiliation.

Right at this moment, the five local citizens gathered to punch the three tourists. If they were really involved in a fight, it wasn’t very likely that the three tourists could win. However, the three tourists were unwilling to retreat. It was a matter of dignity after all.

Seeing that, Gu Ning moved her foot and kicked over a stool to stop the first local citizen who was dashing ahead of the others.

In an instant, he stumbled and fell. What was worse was that the two people who were right behind him knocked into him and fell to the ground too.

With several loud screams of pain, the three of them fell one after another.

It happened too fast and everyone was shocked.

When they realized that it was caused by Gu Ning, they were mad and snapped at her, “What do you mean?”

Gu Ning didn’t stand up until now, followed by Leng Shaoting and her other friends. They stood in a line, facing those angry local citizens.

Leng Shaoting, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya weren’t ordinary people at all, so those local citizens felt a little scared when they stared straight at them. They thought that they were Gu Ning’s bodyguards.

Bodyguards were all good at fighting, while they were merely common citizens.

Gu Ning looked at them and said in a cold voice, “Do you really think that you’re superior to people from other cities? Wake up from your dream, and show some respect. If you want a fight, come and beat me!”

Gu Ning didn’t speak in the local dialect in order to show that she was also a tourist from another city.

The three tourists felt much better when Gu Ning stood out to side with them.

Those local citizens, however, ran towards Gu Ning to beat her. Nevertheless, just as they came near, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya kicked them away with great force.

“Jesus!”

Everyone was amazed. They had never seen anyone else who could kick a person meters away before.

The three tourists got excited at once. They felt quite honored that Gao Yi and Qiao Ya weren’t weak at all.

“Look at you,” Gu Ning sneered at them.

“How dare you hurt me! Do you know who I am?” A young man threatened Gu Ning.

He was the one who had stumbled because of the stool that was kicked by Gu Ning. It sounded like he had a powerful family, but Gu Ning didn’t care about that.

“I don’t care who you are, but you can’t humiliate tourists in a public place!” Gu Ning said.

“You...” The young man was displeased. “I’m the eldest son of the Wan family. Do you know the Wan family? My family is the owner of Wanhuang Casino which is the third largest casino in City M. You just hurt me, and I promise that I’ll pay you back!” he threatened Gu Ning again. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Hearing that he was Lord Wan, the onlookers were surprised. The Wan family was a well-known, super-rich family in City M after all.

All of a sudden, people had sympathy for Gu Ning, because they believed that Gu Ning was in big trouble now.

Gu Ning was just a tourist, so it was impossible for her to get away with it.

To their astonishment, Gu Ning sneered with disdain, “Oh, really? Show me how you’re going to pay me back.”

Gu Ning remembered that her second competitor at the gambling competition was precisely the leading role in the Wan family.

Even if the Wan family was going to punish her, they didn’t have the ability to do so.

“You...”

Wan Baojie couldn’t believe his ears. His family was influential in City M, and nobody dared to annoy him. Therefore, he said to Gu Ning, “Great, don’t you dare run away!”

“Who do you think you are? Why do I have to wait for you here?” Gu Ning rolled her eyes at him.

“You...” Wan Baojie didn’t know what to say. He was obviously reluctant to let them leave, but he couldn’t beat them down either. What Gao Yi and Qiao Ya had just done scared him.

“Do you want to get away with it after beating us?” Wan Baojie’s friend said in anger.

“You can try to stop me if you have the ability,” Gu Ning said.

“You...” Wan Baojie’s friend was struck dumb.

They had been beaten down in the fight, and now even failed to win the argument against Gu Ning. They couldn’t be angrier right now.

“Baojie, do you need me to call some people for help?” someone asked Wan Baojie.

“Do it now!” Wan Baojie raised his voice and vented his anger at his friend. He couldn’t swallow his anger, and was determined to teach Gu Ning a lesson.

The owner of the restaurant walked out at this time. He begged Gu Ning, “Please don’t cause trouble in my restaurant. Would you please move outside?”
