3249 I Didn’t Do It on Purpose

Li Mochen suddenly felt awkward and immediately moved his eyes away from Leng Xiaoyao.

His heart pounded and his cheeks were hot. He couldn’t help but think of… VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Leng Xiaoyao was also embarrassed although she was drugged and unconscious back then.

Bringing it up, she couldn’t help thinking of what had happened at that time. Therefore, she didn’t dare to meet Li Mochen’s eyes and missed his reaction.

“We rarely met afterwards and you were generous to me. You gave me a lot of money and helped me solve problems. We were like that for two years…” Saying that, Leng Xiaoyao suddenly looked upset. She was in no mood to think of the thing that they shouldn’t have done. “One day, I went to a bar with my friends. And I saw you. You told me to leave right away, but I didn’t listen. I quarreled with you. You ordered Mu Yuan to take me away. Because of my shouting, your plan was ruined and your enemies discovered you. All of a sudden, the bar was in chaos. I was held hostage. In order to rescue me, you were shot a few times. And your people…”

Upon thinking of that scene, Leng Xiaoyao burst into tears. She was full of guilt and it broke her heart.

Seeing that, Li Mochen went to hug her at once and comforted her in a gentle voice. “It’s fine. It’s gone. Nothing happened yet. Everyone is fine.”

Even though he didn’t have memories of what Leng Xiaoyao was talking about and didn’t feel it was familiar, it was already gone, so he wouldn’t blame Leng Xiaoyao for that.

He didn’t feel the story sounded familiar because it happened in Leng Xiaoyao’s previous incarnation instead of his. He dreamed about Leng Xiaoyao because they were destined to meet.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t realize that it wasn’t right when Li Mochen hugged her. Instead, she felt comforted when he did that. She continued. “I died in the accident. In a daze, I heard a loud explosion. I am sure it was very serious and you all were killed because of me…”

“After that, I was reincarnated to Dipu Dongxia, in the United Kingdom on Planet Alpha. It was like Country Han with basically the same history. The only difference was that they had different people, land, and place names. There were cultivators too, but not many. My parents, my grandmother, and my teacher were cultivators. They were at high levels. My younger twin brother, Leng Xiaoran, was also a cultivator.”

“At the age of eighteen, I was about to get to the peak of the Golden Core Stage, so I went to the Kunlun Mountain and faced the tribulation. At that time, I learned that my teacher had foreseen my future. I was going to encounter serious trouble when I turned eighteen years old. It really happened. I failed in the tribulation and returned to the Seven Star Country, on Shenyu Planet where I’d lived for twenty years.”

Leng Xiaoyao explained.

Li Mochen was shocked. To his astonishment, Leng Xiaoyao had been through so much. It hurt him to the core.

Leng Xiaoyao added. “When I woke up, I heard a voice saying in my mind. I can’t leave until I finish the redemption. And the person I’m going to save is you. So I told you I owed you in the previous incarnation. I can’t let it happen again in this incarnation.”

She couldn’t leave until she finished a task?

What did that mean? Did it mean that she would go back to Planet Alpha as long as he didn’t get into trouble?

Thinking of that, Li Mochen was sad and tightened his arms around Leng Xiaoyao.

“So, will you go back to where you come from if I’m fine in two years?” asked Li Mochen unwillingly.

He didn’t know when he started caring so much about Leng Xiaoyao. Even he didn’t realize it.

“But I’m not the same person as before. Although I’m not at a high level yet, you know that I have strange power in my body. I was born with the talent to be a cultivator. Within one or two years, I can make a lot of progress. By then, even if we encounter the same trouble, it won’t be a problem for me. Is it really a thing?” asked Li Mochen.

Leng Xiaoyao was struck dumb for a second because she had never thought about that.

“I-I don’t know,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She was suddenly confused.

It was true that Li Mochen could regain his abilities within two years since he had a strange power in his body and his soul was from a master at the peak of the Yuan Ying Period. By then, he would easily be able to overcome the trouble.

Anyway, since it was a new story and they weren’t together like they had been in the previous incarnation, She wouldn’t cause Li Mochen trouble again. It was possible that the accident wouldn’t happen.

Afterwards, both of them were silent.

After being silent for a while, they finally realized that they were hugging each other. The next moment, they loosened their arms, feeling extremely embarrassed.

“Um, I didn’t do that on purpose. You were crying. I didn’t know how to comfort you.” Li Mochen explained at once.

“No worries,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t care about it, but her heart was pounding.

Was it because this was the first time that she had been so close to a man?

That must be the reason!

Li Mochen was also very nervous. This was the first time that he had been so close to a girl as well. Therefore, his heart was pounding too.

“Anyway, I want to visit Guiyun Land. So you should take me there when you go,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She was going to return to Alpha Planet and would visit the Guiyun Land too. She was greatly curious about it.

Unfortunately, they were at low levels right now and had no ability to use the delivery formation. Otherwise, she would go there right away!

“No problem.” Li Mochen answered. An idea dawned on him. If they didn’t come back after going to Guiyun Land, would Leng Xiaoyao not go back to her original world?

Li Mochen was surprised by his idea, but he didn’t think it was wrong.

“But there is little magical power in Shenyu Planet. It’s difficult for me to cultivate here. Can I absorb some power from you? It won’t cause you any loss,” Leng Xiaoyao asked. She had had that idea for a long time, but she needed Li Mochen’s agreement. If he was unwilling to do that, she wouldn’t force him.

“Sure, come to see me whenever you need it.” Li Mochen agreed without hesitation. He was happy to do that, and even felt better since Leng Xiaoyao needed him.
