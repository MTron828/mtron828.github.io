Chapter 105: The V5 Bar

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Especially the old lady, she was still muttering with obvious dissatisfaction. She walked in and said directly, “Tell the waiter we’re ready to order. Gu Man and Gu Qing’s families won’t come.”

It sounded like Gu Man and the family of Gu Qing should be blamed.

“What happened?” Gu Qinyang asked.

The old lady immediately told him everything, along with what had happened between Gu Ning and Gu Xiaoxiao. She obviously didn’t tell all the truth, but attacked Gu Ning all the time.

“What? Gu Ning slapped Xiaoxiao?”

Gu Qinyang’s family were all surprised by Gu Ning’s change. It was so hard for them to believe it. Gu Ning was always behaved like a chicken and never dared to raise her voice in their eyes. How was it possible that she hit Xiaoxiao? Although they also believed that it was Gu Xiaoxiao and the old lady’s fault to call Gu Ning the bastard, they thought it was Gu Ning who had done the worst things.

After that, the old lady told them that she planned to get Gu Ning to help Gu Qinxiang with the project. Her shameless confidence astonished Gu Qinyang and his wife. Even they felt embarrassed for the old lady’s behavior. The old lady was totally insane!

Although Gu Qinyang and his wife despised Gu Man and Gu Ning too, they weren’t willing to turn to them for help after having a terrible quarrel with them, but it had nothing to do with them. They didn’t want to be involved either, so they focused on ordering afterward.

At the same time, Gu Ning and her friends were also ordering dishes.

“Gu Ning, tomorrow is the weekend. Let’s go shopping together!” An Qian said.

“I’m leaving for City G tomorrow, sorry,” Gu Ning answered.

On the way here, Gu Ning had already told Gu Man that she was going to City G, and that she would be attending a classmate’s birthday party later. Gu Ning was now completely able to make decisions on her own. Gu Man and others had no reason to disagree.

“What are you going to do in City G?” An Qian followed up.

“To deal with something.” Gu Ning didn’t tell the details, so An Qian also stopped asking.

“Fine! Then, we can hang out the next time. However, when you’re free, you must call me or text me sometimes. I don’t have many friends in City F. I feel so bored,” An Qian complained.

“Sure,” Gu Ning said. It was her fault for forgetting to keep in touch with An Qian.

During the meal, everyone was happy and the atmosphere was harmonious. An Qian didn’t mention what had just happened at all. She knew that it was Gu Ning’s personal affairs.

After the meal, it was already 8 pm.

Gu Man and the other walked back home after saying good-bye to An Qian and Le Zhengyu, while Gu Ning took a taxi heading to the V5 bar on Huanle Road to meet her friends there.

Huanle Road wasn’t far away from Youyi Road. Both of the roads were near the downtown. It took Gu Ning only a dozen minutes to get there by car. Youyi Road wasn’t broad, but even though it was a small road, it was known as the bar road with many people and cars around.

Gu Ning knew the number of the private room, so she went straight inside. In the private room, everyone was present with a cake, but there was one man out of Gu Ning’s expectation. It was Qin Yifan.

Gu Ning was so surprised that Qin Yifan as a mature adult was willing to hang out with those teenagers, but she was also happy to see him.

“Hi, what a surprise!” Gu Ning greeted him.

“Hi! Well, I’m free anyway, so I decided to come as well. Do you mind?” Qin Yifan said airily, but he was truly nervous that Gu Ning would mind.

“Of course not,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Qin Yifan was greatly relieved. He had actually known that Gu Ning would come to the bar, but it was also a coincidence. Qin Yifan and Qin Zixun were close cousins. Qin Zixun’s father worked in politics, and Qin Yifan was in need of Qin Zixun’s father’s help, so he had visited Qin Zixun’s family.

During the meal, Qin Zixun hadn’t gotten home yet. Qin Yifan had then asked his father why. He then found out that Qin Zixun had eaten with his schoolmates and was going to have fun at the bar that night.

Qin Yifan had then thought of Gu Ning. He had called Qin Zixun, and asked where he was casually. Qin Zixun hadn’t been thinking further, and told him everything. When it had been confirmed that Gu Ning would be there, Qin Yifan’s heart had lost a beat. He had immediately said that he was bored and felt like coming as well. Qin Zixun hadn’t rejected. Qin Yifan wasn’t a stranger after all, and they often gathered together with Hao Ran and other boys.

Both Gu Ning and Yu Mixi ordered fruit wine without much alcohol, which wasn’t as strong as beer. Therefore they wouldn’t get drunk, but Chu Peihan had the same vodka mixed with Sprite as the boys. The alcohol was strong!

They were playing games. Chu Peihan had lost many times, but she remained clear.

It seemed that Chu Peihan was good at drinking.

Although Qin Yifan was having the same drinks as the boys, he didn’t play with them. Because of their age gap, they didn’t get along very well. Besides, he wanted to talk with Gu Ning more, but Gu Ning was enjoying chatting with Yu Mixi, so Qin Yifan wasn’t able to keep Gu Ning talking with him. He could only talk to her once in a while.

In Fenghua Luxury Mansion, only Gu Man and Gu Qing were in Gu Qing’s home, while Jiang Xinyue and Jiang Xu were in their home busy doing their own stuff.

Gu Man and Gu Qing were watching TV. They laughed at the funny plot, and already forgot what had happened this afternoon. They didn’t care about the Gu Family any longer, so they hadn’t been affected, but at that time, Gu Qinxiang called Gu Man. Gu Man and Gu Qing changed their faces at once.

Why did he call?

Although they didn’t know the reason, they knew it must be something bad. Besides, Gu Man had broken off their connection today. Thus she didn’t answer the call. Her phone rang continuously. Gu Man eventually turned if off directly.

In Gu Qinxiang’s place, the family all sat in the living room with an unpleasant face, because Gu Man didn’t answer the phone.

Gu Qinxiang was annoyed that Gu Man refused to answer his calls, but Gu Man had turned it off at the end. Gu Qinxiang was so mad that he threw the phone heavily onto the sofa.

“She won’t answer the phone?” the old lady frowned tightly, and said with annoyance.

“She turned the phone off!” Gu Qinxiang raised his voice.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
