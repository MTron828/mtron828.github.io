Chapter 2682: The Birthday Party ?

Among Master Leng’s five brothers and cousins, three came with grandchildren. Two came with grandsons, and one with granddaughters.

Their grandchildren were at the same age as Leng Shaoting and the others, so they were about twenty-five years old.

Leng Wenzhen was the eldest grandson of Master Leng’s brother. He was twenty-five years old and had worked for two years. Leng Zhuoxuan was the eldest grandson of Master Leng’s cousin. He was twenty-six years old and had worked for three years. Lu Miaoran was the granddaughter of Master Leng’s other cousin. She was twenty-three years old and had worked for half a year.

Leng Wenzhen and Leng Zhuoxuan were the most outstanding kids in their own families. Although they had only worked for two or three years, they were about to receive a promotion.

Leng Wenzhen had a good relationship with Leng Shaoming, and they often met and stayed in touch, but he wasn’t close to Leng Shaoting.

It wasn’t because Leng Shaoting appeared cold and difficult to get along with, but because Leng Shaoting was too outstanding and could easily arouse his peers’ jealousy.

Ever since they were little, Leng Shaoting was the most excellent student in their school. After they grew up, he was still the best kid in everyone’s eyes.

Honestly, many kids dislike it when their parents compliment other kids and disdain them, so Leng Shaoting’s peers started to dislike him.

At the same time, he had many fans among his relatives, like Leng Zhuoxuan and Lu Miaoran. They admired him very much, but because they rarely met, they weren’t very close. Anyway, they still talked when they met.

Leng Zhuoxuan and the others followed their grandfathers to the Leng family’s house. After exchanging greetings with the elders, they went out to see the younger members. Only the young people had common topics so they would feel uneasy if they stayed with the elders.

Leng Shaoting and the others were in the gazebo in the yard. Right after Leng Zhuoxuan walked in, he saw them, but he still needed to greet the elders first. As a result, he didn’t go to them as soon as he arrived at the Leng family’s house.

...

“Hi, Shaoming!” Leng Wenzhen only said hi to Leng Shaoming after he met the young people. He directly ignored everyone else, but no one cared. Anyway, people who were familiar with him knew his character very well, while those who didn’t know him couldn’t care less.

“Hi, Shaoting, Shaoming, Shaoxi, Shaoxun, Mr. Xu, and everyone else.”

Leng Zhuoxuan and Lu Miaoran were very nice and they called the names of everyone they knew.

“Wenzhen, Zhuoxuan, Miaoran, welcome!” said Leng Shaoming. Although Leng Wenzhen had a close relationship with Leng Shaoming, in Leng Shaoming’s eyes, Leng Wenzhen, Leng Zhuoxuan and Lu Miaoran were the same.

As for his peers’ relatives, he treated them equally. If they didn’t want to talk to him, he wouldn’t bother them either.

“Hi, Zhuoxuan, Miaoran!” Leng Shaoxun and Leng Shaoxi called.

“Hi, Zhuoxuan, Miaoran, been a while!” Xu Jinchen smiled at them.

“This is Leng Zhuoxuan, and this is Lu Miaoran. Both of them are relatives.” Leng Shaoting introduced them to Gu Ning and the others.

When they exchanged greetings, they directly ignored Leng Wenzhen. They didn’t do it on purpose, but they were unfamiliar with Leng Wenzhen, so it wasn’t necessary to greet him.

“Nice to meet you all!” Gu Ning and the others greeted them too.

“Oh, are you Shaoting’s fiancée?” Lu Miaoran stared at Gu Ning with great interest. In fact, she was pretty sure of it.

She was aware that Leng Shaoting had a fiancée. Her grandfather told her about it, but she found out that it was Gu Ning from Weibo.

Now she wasn’t only a fan of Leng Shaoting, but was also a fan of Gu Ning. Gu Ning was only nineteen years old, but she was incredibly successful and owned a large corporation with assets worth billions of yuan.

It had never happened before!

“Yeah, I’m Shaoting’s fiancée, Gu Ning.” Gu Ning replied with a smile.

It wasn’t a surprising answer, but Lu Miaoran complimented Gu Ning with great admiration in her voice. “You’re my idol! You’re such a young achiever!”

“Thanks.” Gu Ning smiled and thanked her for the compliment.

After hesitating for a while, Lu Miaoran asked, “Um, Gu Ning, since we’re relatives, can we exchange numbers? Can we be friends on WeChat?”

Lu Miaoran wasn’t talkative, especially in front of strangers, but she was different with Gu Ning. Gu Ning was her idol and any fan would be excited to see their idols.

“Of course!” Gu Ning didn’t decline. Just as Lu Miaoran said, they were relatives so it was very normal that they kept in touch.

Lu Miaoran was very happy to hear that and immediately exchanged phone numbers with Gu Ning.

“Well…” Leng Zhuoxuan shook his head with a resigned smile. He understood Lu Miaoran’s behavior, because he had heard about Gu Ning’s achievements too.

The other people had the same feeling. None of them was surprised by Lu Miaoran’s behavior, except for Leng Wenzhen.

Because Leng Wenzhen hadn’t heard about Gu Ning’s achievements, he didn’t think she was impressive.

Although Lu Miaoran said Gu Ning was a young achiever, Leng Wenzhen didn’t think a young girl could have many achievements.

Therefore, in Leng Wenzhen’s eyes, Lu Miaoran was simply trying to please Gu Ning because Gu Ning was Leng Shaoting’s fiancée.

They were all the Leng family’s relatives, but there was a huge gap between the status of their families and the Leng family’s immediate family. They supported the Leng family and also relied on the Leng family’s influence.

If the Leng family lost one of their families, the Leng family would be fine, but they would suffer a great loss if they lost the Leng family.

Therefore, Leng Wenzhen was jealous of Leng Shaoting, but he didn’t dare to cause Leng Shaoting any trouble.

A while later, Song Wenxuan and his family arrived.

After greeting the elders, Song Wenxuan came to see Gu Ning and the others with Song Yinuo. Song Yinuo could have gone to see them alone, but Song Wenxuan had something to talk about with Gu Ning.

When Song Wenxuan walked over, everyone greeted him. Leng Shaoxi immediately pulled Song Yinuo over to have fun with her.

“Gu Ning, can we talk privately? I need to talk to you about something,” said Song Wenxuan. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Hearing that, everyone turned to glance at Gu Ning, then at Song Wenxuan. They were surprised to know that Song Wenxuan wanted to have a private talk with Gu Ning. Most importantly, Song Wenxuan was very polite to Gu Ning.
