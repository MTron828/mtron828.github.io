Chapter 445 Colaine Pharmaceutical Company

“Well.”

“Let’s go!” Cao Wenxin pulled Jiang Xinyuan’s suitcase walking ahead.

“Thank you so much!” Jiang Xinyuan accepted in the

end.

Cao Wenxin was always talking, but now she was very quiet and didn’t say a word.

It was all because of Leng Shaoting, and even though the man was simply driving silently without saying or doing anything she felt stressed. He did his best to limit his coldness. However, it was still unpleasant for Cao Wenxin to spend time with him in the car. He had a natural air of power and he couldn’t change that. Jiang Xinyuan also felt uneasy, but she didn’t say anything either.

It was a little weird when everyone was quiet in the car, so Gu Ning tried to find something to talk about.

“Wenxin, we can have lunch when we arrive at the hotel. You can have a rest afterwards while I go deal with something. Then we can hang out together tonight,” Gu Ning said. She didn’t tell Cao Wenxin what she was going to deal with, because she thought that it was better to not expose too much.

“Great!” Cao Wenxin agreed.

Within half an hour, they arrived at the hospital. Jiang Xinyuan said good-bye to them and thanked Gu Ning again. After that, they drove to the Huangdeng Hotel in downtown. With Cao Wenxin’s Black Card, they got everything for free.

Gu Ning went upstairs with Cao Wenxin to put their baggage into her suite, while Leng Shaoting waited for them in a private room.

When Leng Shaoting was gone, Cao Wenxin finally relaxed and complained, “Ningning, your boyfriend is a little scary! He’s so cold; I didn’t dare to say a word.”

“Ha-ha, well, yes, he is a little cold, but he’s kind too. He just isn’t talkative. As long as you don’t annoy him, he’s amiable,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Cao Wenxin was a little relieved.

“Oh, does your boyfriend know that my grandpa already took you as his granddaughter?” Cao Wenxin asked.

“Yes,” Gu Ning said.

During lunch, Cao Wenxin wasn’t quiet anymore, but she still felt a little nervous. Luckily, she dared to talk to Leng Shaoting. “Brother-in-law, I heard from Ningning that you’re a military officer. Do you serve in the army or the military regions?” Cao Wenxin asked.

Hearing Cao Wenxin called him brother-in-law, Leng Shaoting was pleased. “Neither. I serve in the corps.”

Hearing that, Cao Wenxin rounded her eyes in shock. The Corps were ranked above the army and the military regions! All of the members in the corps had military ranks, and the lowest rank was major. Precisely because of their high rank in a country’s forces, even a major from the corps was more respected than a commander in the army.

“Um, may I know your military rank?” Cao Wenxin asked. Although he looked young and Cao Wenxin bet that he was either a major or lieutenant colonel, she still wanted to know the answer from his mouth. No matter if he was a major or lieutenant colonel; he had to be very outstanding to get the position at such a young age, because it was rare to see a major or lieutenant colonel who was around 25.

“Major general,” Leng Shaoting said lightly.

“What?” Cao Wenxin was shocked, and couldn’t believe her ears. Major general! Her father had served in the army for dozens of years, and was only ranked as a senior colonel. Although senior colonel wasn’t a low rank, it was barely comparable to major general. Even though senior colonel was just a level lower than major general, there was a huge gap between them when it came to the level of authority.

Leng Shaoting ignored Cao Wenxin’s reaction, but kept persuading Gu Ning to eat more. “You’re too slim, you should gain some weight.”

Gu Ning forced a smile, and didn’t know what to say. She actually ate a lot, but just didn’t gain weight. Gu Ning also ignored Cao Wenxin, because she understood that it would take time for Cao Wenxin to digest the extremely shocking news.

Cao Wenxin felt very emotionally unsettled during the lunch with Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. First, she was deeply shocked by Leng Shaoting’s military rank, and then she felt lonely in front of the loving couple. All of a sudden, she wanted to have a boyfriend too.

After lunch, Gu Ning left with Leng Shaoting, while Cao Wenxin went to visit her friend who lived in the capital.

What Gu Ning was going to deal with was the medical company. Its name was Colaine Pharmaceutical Company, and it was a medium-sized medical company with an authorized capital of thirty million yuan. Its business included Chinese patent medicines, chemical preparations, antibiotics, biochemical medicines, biological products (except for vaccines), medical equipment, health foods, pre-packaged foods, consumer products, cosmetics, and so on.

The reason why Colaine Pharmaceutical Company could barely stay afloat was not because it had bad sales, but because of business competition.

From the materials K had given Gu Ning, the medicine quality and sales of Colaine Pharmaceutical Company were generally good, and its chairman, Ning Changkai, was also an upright man. However, its opponent in business was jealous of its good sales, and deliberately caused Colaine trouble with the help of certain officials.

When Colaine sent their medicines for testing, their medicines never passed. That being the case, they couldn’t put their medicines on the market, and failed to supply medicine merchants according to their agreement. As a result, Colaine had to pay a considerable amount of liquidated damages, and many medicine merchants terminated their deals afterwards. Shareholders also started to withdraw their investments and workers continuously quit their jobs. So now, Colaine Pharmaceutical Company was amid a crisis.

Colaine Pharmaceutical Company had been established for only eight years, and didn’t have much support in the government, so it was very difficult for it to fight back. Since its opponent didn’t stop, it could only go bankrupt.

If the company went bankrupt, its chairman would have to pay a huge debt. Therefore, its chairman decided to sell it before the tragedy happened. However, it wasn’t easy to sell, unless someone who had a powerful network was willing to take it over.

After reading the materials, Gu Ning called Ning Changkai at once, and told him that she wanted to acquire his company.

Although Colaine Pharmaceutical Company was just a medium-sized company, it had a great location. The company covered around three thousand square-meters in all. Its floor area was two thousand square-meters, including eight office buildings, a six-story staff dormitory, and a five-story factory. The other one thousand square-meters consisted of parking lots and plants.

When Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting arrived, Ning Changkai’s secretary was waiting for them in the hall. Once they appeared, the secretary guided them to the chairman’s office upstairs. The moment that Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting stepped into an elevator, the two girls working at the reception burst into discussion.

“Jesus! The man is so handsome!”

“Indeed! He’s even more handsome than those male stars!”

“However, he looks cold and stayed aloof.”

“It’s called the air of nobility!”
