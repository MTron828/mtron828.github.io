Chapter 1960: Simply Shocking

“What happened?” asked Cai Wenhong quizzically when he heard Gu Ning. Why did she suddenly want them to pull over? It was impossible to pull over here.

“Don’t ask. Just do it,” said Gu Ning swiftly. She did not have the time to explain.

“Okay.” Cai Wenhong realized how serious she was, so he stopped asking. He immediately took out his phone and called the man driving the car up ahead.

The huge truck behind accelerated and came increasingly closer while Cai Wenhong was calling his men.

Gu Ning frowned slightly and felt annoyed and somewhat anxious. She could not let Chen Darong physically block the huge truck as that would put them in grave danger. Although she was around to save them, she would much prefer to avoid it altogether.

Cai Wenhong did not know why Gu Ning suddenly asked for the transport vehicle to stop. However, he trusted she had a good reason, so he had to take it seriously.

Since the line was busy, Cai Wenhong hung up and called someone else. This time, someone finally answered.

Cai Wenhong immediately told them to stop. His subordinate asked him why, but Cai Wenhong could not give him a reason. Even if he knew what was going on, he did not have time to explain. He simply ordered them to stop immediately. Hence, the guy on the phone told the driver to pull up right away, and the driver did as he was told. Gu Ning also told Chen Darong to pull up.

The moment all the cars pulled up, the huge truck drove past them and charged right towards the front of the transport vehicle and went straight towards the railing before crashing over.

Everyone watched in shock, especially the people in the museum’s transport vehicle.

They finally realized why Curator Cai told them to pull up. If they were just a second slower, the huge truck would have hit them and they would have fallen off the bridge instead.

If they did not slam the brakes in time, the huge truck would have sent them flying off the bridge. The huge truck was clearly aiming to run them over.

A lot of force was needed to run the transport vehicle off the bridge, so the huge truck kept accelerating. However, the museum transport vehicle suddenly stopped. By the time the huge truck’s driver wanted to step on the brake, it was too late and they drove off the bridge instead.

Although the bridge was not very high, just three or four meters tall, it was very dangerous to fall headlong.

Harada Honichi kept following them in his car. He did not anticipate this and was both shocked and furious.

“Damn it,” cursed Harada Honichi.

“Master, was that your…” Harada Honichi’s disciple instantly realized Harada Honichi had planned this. Even though Harada Honichi said nothing, he was silently admitting to it. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Gu Ning also saw his reaction.

“M-miss Gu, did you realize something was wrong?” Cai Wenhong’s voice trembled as he was still trembling in fright.

Despite Cai Wenhong’s question, he was certain Gu Ning must have noticed something amiss. Otherwise, she would not have suddenly told him to get the vehicles to stop.

“Uh huh! I noticed a car following us a long time ago. It kept driving a decent distance from us and it had been following us at the exact same speed. Also, I encountered a similar situation before. Since we have just auctioned off the bronze chimes today, I had a feeling something would happen. I thought someone might come after the bronze chimes, so I felt we should pull up to be safe,” said Gu Ning.

“That was such a close shave…” Chen Darong was terribly frightened and kept shivering. If he had to drive now, he was not so sure if he could still hold the steering wheel properly.

Xu Jinchen stopped his car as well. He also suffered quite a scare. They were particularly vigilant after Gu Ning reminded them to be careful. However, the little accident happened anyway. Fortunately, nothing happened to them.

They were on high alert transporting the bronze chimes to the museum, so they were certain this was no accident. It was a premeditated attack on them.

Even though everyone escaped unscathed, Xu Jinchen and Zi Beiying got out of the car and ran over to Gu Ning, leaving Mengda and Nan in the car.

A lot of other cars had pulled up. Some people called 911 while some of them attempted to save the passengers in the huge truck.

Since it was a major accident, Gu Ning and the others could not leave right away. Gu Ning told Chen Darong and Cai Wenhong to stay in the car while she got off and walked over to the railing. However, Gu Ning had no intention of helping. Even if she had the ability to save them, they deserved to die since they were the ones who wanted to attack them first!

“That was really scary. The huge truck almost ran into the transport vehicle,” said Xu Jinchen and Zi Beiying as they walked up to Gu Ning.

“Uh huh!” replied Gu Ning. She also felt they were lucky to escape. The museum transport vehicle was a hair’s breadth from falling off the bridge.

“I wonder why they suddenly decided to step on the brake at the perfect time,” said Zi Beiying quizzically.

“I noticed something wrong with the huge truck, so I told Curator Cai to call the driver and get them to stop. It was pure luck that the huge truck accelerated and charged right past them the moment they pulled over,” replied Gu Ning.

Everyone finally knew why the museum transport vehicle suddenly stopped.

Only Gu Ning’s inner circle knew this was not an accident. Everyone else felt it was an accident that the huge truck lost control. They simply felt the museum transport vehicle was lucky to escape unscathed when it pulled over at the perfect time.

Gu Ning did not want to hold the truck driver accountable since she did not want people to know it was premeditated. However, she was certainly going to seek revenge on Harada Honichi for this.

The huge truck’s driver was injured, but it was not serious. He escaped the truck quickly before abandoning it and swimming to the shore.

Although the river was not deep, it was deep enough for the entire vehicle to get submerged.

The driver came up and saw the museum transport vehicle standing in one piece and could not help feeling uneasy. However, he composed himself and acted as though it was an accident. Although he had failed his mission, he felt lucky to be alive. However, he remained puzzled. How did the museum transport vehicle know when to stop? Despite his curiosity, he could not ask the museum transport vehicle driver. The moment he did, he would get exposed.

After the driver came back up, many people went over to check on him and called for an ambulance.

Although Harada Honichi was furious that the driver did not accomplish his mission, it was not the right time to show his face. He could only watch as the entire event transpired. However, he was not worried that the driver would rat him out.

Gu Ning and the others said nothing as they watched from the side.
