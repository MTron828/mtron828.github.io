1138 Dine with Master Leng

Given what had happened, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting wouldn’t allow Zi Beiying to leave alone again. They went back to the hotel together afterwards.

On the way, Zi Beiying kept thinking of Xu Jinchen. She had to admit that her heart skipped a beat when Xu Jinchen looked at her with that gentle look.

“Lady Zi, are you alright?” Nan noticed the absent look on Zi Beiying’s face and asked her with concern.

“Oh, I’m fine,” Zi Beiying said and flushed a little.

When they arrived at the hotel, Gu Ning said to Zi Beiying, “Beiying, you don’t need to worry about the surveillance cameras. Nobody will know what happened on that road.”

K had sent Gu Ning a message and told her what exactly had happened on the road.

The police also found five bodies later, but the surveillance cameras were all hacked, so they had no clues to find the killer. Without enough clues, it was very difficult for the police to find out the truth.

After preliminary investigation, the police found out that the five men were from Southeast Asia. Although they had ID cards with them, the information on the ID cards didn’t match them. It was obvious that they were killed in the middle of something illegal.

Since they were criminals, the police wouldn’t bother to thoroughly investigate it.

...

“Thank you so much for your help.” Zi Beiying thanked Gu Ning.

In fact, even if the police found out that she was the killer, she would still be fine and safe, because they all came from Southeast Asia, and they would be judged back in their country.

The Zi family was very influential in Southeast Asia, and Zi Beiying was confident that her family could protect her well.

“When will you leave tomorrow?” Gu Ning asked.

“The plane will take off at 9:40 am,” Zi Beiying said.

“Great, I’ll send you to the airport tomorrow,” Gu Ning said.

Zi Beiying understood that Gu Ning was worried about her safety, but she didn’t want to bother her. “It’s fine, we can take care of ourselves.”

“Let me send you to the airport. I’ll meet you at 8 am,” Gu Ning said and insisted.

Zi Beiying then accepted her kindness.

Hearing their talk, Xu Jinchen opened his mouth, but didn’t know what to say. He wanted to send Zi Beiying to the airport himself, but Zi Beiying already accepted Gu Ning’s offer, so he closed his mouth. In addition, he felt nervous talking to Zi Beiying now.

They walked Zi Beiying and her bodyguards to their rooms before they left.

Zi Beiying and Xu Jinchen, however, felt upset when they separated from each other.

...

Tang Bingsen arranged for someone to find out what “Tang Aining” had done during the past days, but he got nothing useful.

K had removed any connection between Gu Ning and the “Tang Aining” from surveillance cameras, so nobody would know that Gu Ning and “Tang Aining” were the same person.

Tang Bingsen only found the car that “Tang Aining” had driven yesterday to meet Qi Ziyue in the suburb. Other than that, he didn’t get anything useful.

Tang Bingsen was shocked by the result, because it turned out to be very hard for him to find out where “Tang Aining” was right now. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

If he couldn’t get any useful information about “Tang Aining”, it would be impossible for him to kill her.

In fact, “Tang Aining” seemed to appear out of blue, and she could disappear without anyone knowing it.

Tang Bingsen thought for a long while, then was even more certain that “Tang Aining” wasn’t his dead daughter, Tang Aining, but could be a good friend of his dead daughter.

Tang Aining’s good friend disguised herself as Tang Aining in order to avenge Tang Aining’s death.

It had to be the truth. Tang Bingsen was very sure of it.

Since “Tang Aining” was able to hide her traces and dared to act against the Tang family, he must be alert and prepared.

Anyway, he still had several photos of the “Tang Aining”, which could help him find her.

...

The next day, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to pick up Zi Beiying and her bodyguards, then drove them to the airport.

When they got back from the airport, Gu Ning said to Leng Shaoting, “I’ll fly back to City B tomorrow, and I’ll stay in City B for a few days. After that, I’ll go to City F to attend the National College Entrance Examination.”

The National College Entrance Examination was only 20 days away. Gu Ning was still a student, so she should go back to her school before the important exam.

Moreover, she also wanted to gather together with her friends in the high school more often. It was possible that they wouldn’t see each other again after the National College Entrance Examination.

“I’m leaving for the military base too, so I can’t go with you,” Leng Shaoting said.

“It’s fine,” Gu Ning said.

“Why don’t we dine with grandpa and his friends this afternoon before we leave the capital?” Gu Ning asked.

“Good idea,” Leng Shaoting said.

After that, Gu Ning called Master Leng and his friends, and they all excitedly agreed to dine together.

Gu Ning also said that she could cook for them in Leng Shaoting’s house.
