Chapter 2427: For an Explanation

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning, however, didn’t think it was a big problem. This manor might be very dangerous, but she didn’t think she would get hurt. Therefore, when the gatekeeper said that they could go in, Gu Ning didn’t hesitate at all and walked inside.

The others did the same.

The two gatekeepers, on the other hand, felt they had too much confidence. Weren’t they afraid that they wouldn’t survive today?

One of them stayed to guard the gate, while the other guided them inside.

Along the way, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to check every corner of the manor.

This manor looked as normal as any other on the surface. All the people in it were very strong, but it didn’t mean that they were all killers.

There weren’t many people there; the number wouldn’t exceed fifteen.

There were two guards at the gate of the manor, two at the gate of the main building, two in the backyard, and two in the room.

The people outside the door were all guarding and patrolling around, while the people inside were watching TV leisurely. They had to be the management of this organization.

The basement of this manor was an important place. It was about one meter underneath the ground on the first floor.

In the basement, there was a conference room of about fifty square meters, a pantry, a bathroom, and a warehouse.

In this warehouse, there were many guns and explosives, as well as some valuable objects, gold, silver, jewelry, antique calligraphy and paintings.

All of these things were their payments, because not every person who hired them used cash.

In the conference room in the basement, there were three people sitting and talking. They might be killers, and their conversation should be related to a task.

The gate of the manor was about a hundred meters away from the main building. When they approached the gate of the main building, the two guards outside walked towards them.

They also recognized Gao Yi and Qiao Ya, so when they saw them they were surprised. It was beyond their expectation that Gao Yi and Qiao Ya would come back by themselves.

“What happened?” one man asked the gatekeeper who brought Gu Ning and her people over.

“This is Miss Gu. She’s the guest of our head. Our head told them to wait in the living room for a while. He’ll arrive in half an hour,” said the gatekeeper.

“Come on in!” Hearing that, the man nodded and didn’t ask further. They knew what they shouldn’t ask about. However, they were still curious about why Gu Ning came here.

Weren’t they afraid that they might not be able to leave after they came here?

Given their confident and calm look, they didn’t seem afraid.

Perhaps this Miss Gu had made a deal with their head so that she could protect Flying Bird and Flying Eagle.

Guards at the door couldn’t go in without permission, so they only rang the bell and waited in silence.

Before long, the door opened.

A man about forty years old came to open the door for them. When he saw Gao Yi and Qiao Ya, he was surprised too.

“Housekeeper, this is Miss Gu. She’s the guest of our head. Our head told them to wait in the living room for a while. He’ll be here in a while.” Before the man said anything, the guard reported everything to him.

The housekeeper squinted a little, but didn’t ask further. “Come in!” he said.

Gu Ning and the others walked inside.

Although he didn’t know why Gao Yi and Qiao Ya came back with this Miss Gu, they had to be there for something important since they were their head’s guests. As the housekeeper, he shouldn’t ask about that.

He took them to have a seat in the living room, then poured tea for them, but nobody drank it.

They weren’t afraid that it might be poisoned. Even if the tea was poisoned, they would still be fine after drinking it. They simply didn’t want to do that.

The housekeeper said nothing, but wouldn’t take his eyes away from Gao Yi and Qiao Ya. However, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya ignored his gaze.

Half an hour later, their head came. He was tall and strong and he had a black mask on his face. However, although he covered his face, Gu Ning had a pair of Jade Eyes, so she could still see it.

He was handsome and young. He should be about thirty years old.

When Gao Yi and Qiao Ya saw him, they felt slightly guilty, so they didn’t dare to meet his eyes. After all, they used to work for him and they had betrayed their organization and the head.

When the head saw Gao Yi and Qiao Ya, he didn’t show obvious anger, because it had happened many times before. Till now, he had punished all the betrayers, except for Gao Yi and Qiao Ya.

It was because of Gu Ning. Gu Ning removed their names and photos from the wanted list and they couldn’t be uploaded again.

“Miss Gu, why are you staring at me the entire time? Did I impress you?” The head joked when he noticed that Gu Ning was focusing on him.

Saying that, he went to sit across from Gu Ning.

Gu Ning wasn’t mad at his words and said, “Since you’ve done research on me, you should know that I have a fiancé. He’s extremely handsome. There is no man who is more attractive than him in this world. I’m not interested in you at all.”

“Your fiancé is indeed very handsome, but I’m not worse than him,” said the man. He didn’t think that he was less attractive than Leng Shaoting.

Actually, he was almost as good-looking as Leng Shaoting, but Leng Shaoting was the most handsome guy in Gu Ning’s opinion.

“Why don’t you take off your mask and let me have a look then?” Gu Ning said.

“No, I don’t think it’s a good idea,” said the man. It was impossible for him to take off the mask.

Gu Ning had already seen his face, so she didn’t care.

“Miss Gu, I bet you didn’t come to my place for cooperation, right?” asked the man with certainty.

“Yeah, your people captured my people and injured her. They even threatened me and told me that if I don’t agree to work with you, you’ll harm my business. I don’t have a good temper. Since you dare to do that, I need an explanation,” said Gu Ning in a flat voice. She didn’t look angry at all.

“Your people?” The head sneered. “Perhaps they’re your people now, but they’ve betrayed me. It’s my right to punish them. Miss Gu, I do want to cooperate with you.. If you’re willing to do that, I can let them go.”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
