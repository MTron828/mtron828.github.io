Chapter 2550: Jing Yanhua Is also Angry

Jing Jining stopped arguing afterwards, but his intention was obvious. He was implying that Jing Yaorong might not be a match for Jing Yunyao.

At this moment, Jing Yaorong was in a terrible mood, because what Jing Jining said was true. He knew that Jing Yunyao had reached a new level, but he wasn’t clear about her abilities.

As a result, although he guessed that Jing Yunyao was in the early stage of the Yuan Ying Period now, he wasn’t sure about it.

“What’s her current level?” Jing Yaorong asked seriously. He knew that Jing Jining wouldn’t tell him, but he still wanted to know the answer, because it seemed Jing Yunyao’s level was higher than he thought. If so, it would be bad news.

“Since I won’t interfere in your grudge against Yunyao, I won’t tell you her current level,” said Jing Jining.

“You…” It wasn’t a surprising answer, but he was still angry at Jing Jining’s answer. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Patriarch, if there is nothing important, I will go now,” said Jing Jining. He lost his patience and was unwilling to waste more time arguing with Jing Yaorong.

Jing Yaorong didn’t reply to Jing Jining, but turned to look at Jing Yanhua. “Yanhua, do you agree with him?”

“Patriarch, you told Jining not to interfere. Since Jining isn’t allowed to be involved, isn’t it right that he says nothing to either side?” Jing Yanhua supported Jing Jining.

“Do you believe that Jing Jining won’t tell Jing Yunyao about the Jing family’s situation?” Jing Yaorong asked. He refused to trust Jing Jining. After all, Jing Jining had a close relationship with Jing Yunyao. Because of what he had done to Jing Yunyao, Jing Jining had harbored a long-standing grudge against him. It was impossible that he said nothing about the Jing family to Jing Yunyao.

If Jing Yunyao wanted to take revenge, she undoubtedly needed to know the Jing family’s situation better.

“I don’t know what he has done before, but now it is different,” said Jing Yanhua. He implied that it wasn’t Jing Jining’s fault even if he had done that before.

“Do you mean you support Jing Yunyao in getting revenge against the Jing family? Jing Yanhua, don’t forget that you’re also a member of the Jing family. If I’m killed, it won’t do you any good.” In anger, Jing Yaorong directly called Jing Yanhua’s full name.

“But I’ve never hurt Yunyao,” said Jing Yanhua. In other words, Jing Yunyao would only pay Jing Yaorong back. He was innocent.

“You…” Jing Yaorong was getting angrier and was more convinced that Jing Yanhua and Jing Jining wanted to replace him. Therefore, he asked, “Do you look forward to seeing me killed? Do you aim to replace me?”

“Patriarch!” Jing Yanhua instantly got mad. He called Jing Yaorong the patriarch this time, because he never had the thought of replacing Jing Yaorong. He only felt hurt that Jing Yaorong was suspicious of him. “Why do you have to hurl accusations on innocent people? You’re the one who tried to kill Yunyao. Now the dirty secret has been exposed, yet you try to blame us for that. What exactly do you want? If you’re suspicious of us, you can chase us out of the Jing family.”

Because he was also a member of the Jing family, Jing Yanhua always worked diligently and stayed loyal to Jing Yaorong. Even when he learned that Jing Yaorong had killed Jing Yunyao, he didn’t report it to Tiandaozong.

However, Jing Yaorong became suspicious of them just because he felt threatened. It hurt him deeply. As a result, he was serious if Jing Yaorong really wanted to chase them out of the Jing family.

Being a member of the Jing family made him feel humiliated now.

The Jing family had a bad reputation, but he could tolerate it. However, Jing Yaorong’s attitude broke his heart.

“You…” Jing Yaorong was very mad, but he didn’t think he was wrong. After all, it was a fact that Jing Jining didn’t tell them that Jing Yunyao was still alive and refused to tell him about Jing Yunyao’s current level. By doing that, Jing Jining put the Jing family in danger, which easily aroused suspicion.

“Patriarch, make it short, what exactly do you want to do?”Jing Yanhua asked. He also lost his patience and wanted a definite answer right now.

Looking at Jing Yanhua angrily, Jing Yaorong said nothing, because there was no reason for him to chase Jing Yanhua’s family out of the Jing family.

Most importantly, if he chased Jing Yanhua’s family out of the Jing family, they would certainly side with Jing Yunyao afterwards. It would only make the situation worse.

Jing Yaorong said nothing, while Jing Yanhua and Jing Jining remained silent too. They were waiting for Jing Yaorong’s next step.

After remaining quiet for a while, Jing Yaorong said, “Alright, you can leave now. I will trust you once.”

In the end, Jing Yaorong stopped arguing and let them leave.

Since Jing Yaorong said nothing further, Jing Yanhua and Jing Jining directly left.

Back in the south yard, Jing Yanhua asked Jing Jining whether he had told Shangguan Yang Jing Yaorong was already aware that Jing Yunyao wasn’t dead.

Jing Jining honestly replied that he had. Anyway, it wouldn’t change the result whether or not he had told Shangguan Yang that, so Jing Yanhua didn’t think it was a big deal.

However, Jing Jining didn’t tell his father that he had recorded his conversation with Jing Yaorong, then gave it to Gu Ning. And that Gu Ning would pass it to Jing Yunyao.

Even though Jing Yanhua was his father and he could trust his father, he still had his own secrets.

…

When Shangguan Yang and Gu Ning got back to the siheyuan, it was already 10 pm. It wasn’t too late, so the others were still awake. They were chatting casually in the living room.

After they were back, Gu Ning asked Jiang Liluo and Si Jin about their first day at work.

Jiang Liluo and Si Jin replied that they weren’t used to it yet because it was the first time that they had worked, but they didn’t encounter any difficulties.

It was understandable, because this was a new experience and they would get better over time.

Actually, Jiang Liluo and Si Jin only felt a bit unaccustomed with their work. It wasn’t too bad. They were born in the ancient times after all. The only thing that didn’t change in modern society was character.
