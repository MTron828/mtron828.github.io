Chapter 2853: Bright Day

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Although Gu Ning told him to have a rest, he didn’t dare to leave when Gu Ning was still awake.

Because Zheng Peng insisted, Gu Ning said nothing.

However, nothing happened that night. Gu Ning didn’t lose her patience, because she understood that those thieves might not come back tonight.

After all, no one knew when the bunch of thieves would come again, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting couldn’t catch them right away.

On the other hand, Zheng Peng was unhappy about it. “I wonder whether they have no plan to come tonight, or if they heard something and disappeared.”

He hoped that those thieves would come, then Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting could catch them and solve the problem as soon as possible. Afterwards, they could sleep at ease. It would also save some time for Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

“No idea, perhaps it’s just a coincidence! We’ll see what will happen tonight,” said Gu Ning. She also wanted those thieves to come quickly, so that she could deal with it and go back to the capital as soon as possible. After all, the situation in the capital was also worrying.

Although Jing Yunyao and the others could protect the Leng family, Gu Ning was still anxious because she cared about them.

However, it wouldn’t be a problem if she failed to catch those thieves before going back to the capital. She could just let the flood dragon stay there and watch the mountain.

There was a river under the mountain, so the flood dragon could live here.

If the thieves were cultivators, monsters, or ghosts, the flood dragon could fight with them. If they were just human beings, the flood dragon could scare them.

The thieves wouldn’t come in the day, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting returned to the city center first.

Before that, Gu Ning made up an excuse and went to look around the mountain, then she told the flood dragon to stay here.

Hopefully, the thieves weren’t cultivators.

Zheng Peng also went back to the city center with them, because he needed to deal with something in the company.

During the past few days, Zheng Peng spent most of his time in City Rui because the new company had just been established and he was busy with work.

The company in City Teng, however, had already entered a steady condition. There were loyal and skilled managers, so he didn’t need to be worried.

Because Gu Ning and the others returned to the city center early in the morning, it was only about 8:30 am when they arrived. They hadn’t had breakfast yet, so they went to eat first.

Afterwards, Zheng Peng drove them to the hotel before going back to the company.

Zheng Peng booked a room for them yesterday. They didn’t sleep last night, but they needed a rest today.

Although Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t have any sleep last night, they were still full of energy so they decided to go to the jade raw material market to see if they could find high quality jade.

Even though she had countless jade raw materials now, she still wanted more. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It was still early, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went back to the hotel for a while. They would have lunch outside, then go to the jade raw material market.

As soon as they were in the room, Gu Ning was pressed against the bed.

“It’s bright daylight. What are you doing!?” Gu Ning glared at him.

“Let’s make love!” Leng Shaoting said with an evil smile.

“You’re so horny!” Gu Ning said exasperatedly.

“Can you satisfy me?” Leng Shaoting asked as he started undressing Gu Ning. “We didn’t do it last night.” He complained.

“Is sex all that is on your mind?” Gu Ning rolled her eyes with a resigned look, but she didn’t push Leng Shaoting away.

“Don’t you want to?” Leng Shaoting raised his eyes, staring straight at Gu Ning.

Gu Ning blinked and panicked a little, then she felt embarrassed. “I don’t want to!” She argued loudly.

“Really? If you don’t want to, why did you panic?” asked Leng Shaoting.

“I didn’t!” Gu Ning retorted, but lowered her voice this time.

At that moment, Leng Shaoting placed his large balm on her chest and rubbed her breasts. Gu Ning couldn’t help but moan in pleasure, immediately arousing Leng Shaoting.

“You denied it with words, but your body actually wants it badly.” Leng Shaoting flirted with Gu Ning.

“You…” Gu Ning was too mad to finish a sentence, so she tried to push Leng Shaoting away. Leng Shaoting comforted her right away. “Alright, alright, it’s my fault. I shouldn’t have embarrassed you, but I really want you right now.”

“Don’t blame me for arousing you…” The moment she opened her mouth again, Leng Shaoting kissed her.

Soon after, they had passionate sex.

They hadn’t had sex in a while, so they didn’t stop until a few hours had passed.

They originally planned to go eat at 11 am and then go to the jade raw material market at about 12 pm, but it was already 12:30 pm by the time they left the hotel.

Gu Ning’s stomach grumbled as they left, signaling that she was hungry.

She couldn’t be more familiar with Leng Shaoting, but she still felt embarrassed when it happened right in front of Leng Shaoting.

“Ha-ha.” Leng Shaoting was amused.

Gu Ning got mad when Leng Shaoting laughed and immediately gave him a glare. “What are you laughing at? It’s all your fault. We agreed to go eat at 11 am, but you delayed it. I’m starving now.”

“Are you starving? Do you want my body?” Leng Shaoting deliberately misunderstood Gu Ning’s words and implied that she might want more sex.

“You…” Gu Ning was angry, but she was afraid that Leng Shaoting might really do it again, so she quickly strode out.

Seeing that, Leng Shaoting put on a resigned smile. He wouldn’t pull her back to the room to have more sex. Even if he wanted to, he cared more about her condition. And she was hungry now.

Leng Shaoting closed the door and left with Gu Ning.

“What do you want to eat?” asked Leng Shaoting.

“Seafood!” Gu Ning grumbled on purpose. She actually wanted to have a simple meal, but now she wanted to have a great meal and make Leng Shaoting pay for it.

However, she felt it was somewhat boring. A nice seafood meal was expensive for ordinary people, but it was barely a cent for Leng Shaoting.

It wasn’t a smart move!

Anyway, she wanted to eat seafood.

“No problem, you can eat whatever you want,” Leng Shaoting said in a loving tone. He understood what Gu Ning wanted to do, but he was willing to buy whatever she wanted.
