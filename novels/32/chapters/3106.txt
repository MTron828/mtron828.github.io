3108 Jiang Yihan and Chu Jianan

Actually, when Jiang Yihan did that, she was very nervous, because she was purposely seducing Chu Jianan. It was the first time that she had ever done that, so she was nervous.

At the same time, she felt very excited and wanted to do more.

“Jianan, Yuqi seems to be in a bad mood recently. Did you have a fight? I know it’s your personal affair and I shouldn’t ask about it as an outsider, but you seem to be in a bad mood too, so I thought I should care about you. Please don’t be mad. If you don’t want to tell me, I can understand,” Jiang Yihan said, her voice filled with concern for Chu Jianan.

“We didn’t quarrel, but something has indeed gone wrong between us. I want to be alone for a while,” Chu Jianan said. He wanted to stay away from Leng Yuqi.

“Oh!” Jiang Yihan answered. Upon hearing that something went wrong between Chu Jianan and Leng Yuqi, she was pleased. “If so, don’t think about the unhappy things. Jianan, let’s play games!”

“Sure.” Chu Jianan agreed, then played Sic Bo with Jiang Yihan.

A few rounds later, Jiang Yihan deliberately dropped a dice, then bent to pick it up.

Once she bent, her breasts were exposed further. Chu Jianan saw it and subconsciously swallowed hard. He was completely aroused now.

If Chu Jianan didn’t drink, he wouldn’t be aroused so easily, but now he was totally attracted to Jiang Yihan. However, he showed none of it on his face.

Jiang Yihan couldn’t see his real feelings, but she had patience. She knew it would take time.

“Come on, let’s dance!” Someone proposed.

“Why not!” Jiang Yihan’s friend agreed and immediately turned the lights darker.

Someone went to play louder music and they began to dance in an empty area.

Because the music became louder, they had to be close in order to hear each other. Therefore, Chu Jianan approached Jiang Yihan’s ears and asked, “Do you want to dance?”

Feeling Chu Jianan’s warm breath, Jiang Yihan got nervous.

“I-I can’t…” Jiang Yihan said.

“Just randomly move your body. Let’s go! Since we’re out for fun, we must enjoy ourselves.” Saying that, Chu Jianan pulled Jiang Yihan’s hand and walked to the dance floor.

When Chu Jianan held her hand, Jiang Yihan’s heart pounded faster. She wished the moment could last forever! She wanted Chu Jianan to hold her hand, and only her hand.

Anyway, since Chu Jianan pulled her to dance, Jiang Yihan didn’t resist, but she really didn’t know how to dance, so she looked slightly embarrassed.

“Just follow me and move your body,” Chu Jianan said. Then he held her hands and began to move his body.

Seeing that, Jiang Yihan moved her body as well. At the beginning, she still felt awkward, but gradually she started to enjoy herself.

After dancing for a while, someone knocked Jiang Yihan into Chu Jianan. Jiang Yihan fell into his arms and Chu Jianan subconsciously hugged her.

It was the first time that they were so close. Jiang Yihan panicked and they immediately separated.

“Sorry, I didn’t mean to…” Chu Jianan apologized at once.

“N-No worries,” Jiang Yihan said. She didn’t dare to meet Chu Jianan’s eyes, but she honestly didn’t care about it at all. Instead, she loved it when they were so close.

However, right when Jiang Yihan stood up and wanted to walk away, she slipped and fell into Chu Jianan again.

Seeing that, Chu Jianan subconsciously supported her, but he avoided hugging her this time. He didn’t want to be embarrassed again.

In that instant, Jiang Yihan felt it too.

This time, Jiang Yihan was so embarrassed that she wished it hadn’t happened. Although she had the intention of seducing him, she never planned to be so straightforward.

Without delay, Jiang Yihan got back to her feet and apologized to Chu Jianan. “Jianan, I’m sorry. I didn’t do it on purpose.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s fine.” Chu Jianan replied. Then he joked. “But I almost lost control.”

Jiang Yihan instantly flushed red. She honestly didn’t do it on purpose.

Luckily, the other people focused on dancing and didn’t know what they were doing. If other people saw it, they would be even more embarrassed.

“Um, why don’t you call Yuqi over? She’s your girlfriend. She can help you.” Jiang Yihan blushed scarlet. Although Leng Yuqi hadn’t told her what they did privately, she knew they must have had sex before.

“Don’t bring her up. It’s upsetting.” Chu Jianan interrupted unhappily and calmed down a little. Suddenly, he lost interest in Leng Yuqi and started to be interested in Jiang Yihan.

Even if he couldn’t forget Leng Xiaoyao, he clearly knew it was impossible for them to be together. No matter how beautiful and outstanding Leng Xiaoyao was, it couldn’t change the fact that she had humiliated him many times.

He had his own dignity, so he wouldn’t allow his woman to humiliate him like that.

“Sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you.” Jing Yihan apologized at once, looking pitiful. Chu Jianan melted right away.

Actually, he didn’t blame Jiang Yihan. He wasn’t so mean.

“Alright, since you can’t dance, why don’t we go back and continue to drink?” Chu Jianan said. He suddenly had the idea of getting Jiang Yihan drunk.

“Sure.” Jiang Yihan answered, then they went to sit on the sofa and continued to drink.
