Chapter 2193: Don’t Be Fooled by Them

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The deputy dean was mad, but didn’t dare to meet Gu Ning’s eyes.

Right when he was about to criticize Gu Ning earlier, he was interrupted by her, otherwise he would be greatly embarrassed.

Although the doctors who came with the deputy dean didn’t think highly of Gu Ning, and felt it was ridiculous, they said nothing to Gu Ning’s face. Therefore, they didn’t feel guilty and turned to ask Gu Ning how she did it.

Gu Ning only told them that it was her unique skill and was a secret.

Without getting the answer, those doctors were disappointed. Some of them tried to persuade Gu Ning by saying that it was a virtue to save people. If she could teach them, they would be able to help more people. Gu Ning, however, wasn’t convinced and even disdained them.

“I am neither a doctor nor a savior. It’s a virtue to save people, but are you willing to save patients who don’t have money? If you’re unwilling to do that, stop talking about these meaningless principles. I’m not a naive girl who’s easy to fool.” Gu Ning retorted unceremoniously.

“Well…” Hearing Gu Ning’s words, those doctors didn’t know what to say next.

Gu Ning ignored them, and directly took out a bottle with three power crystals. She handed it to Chen Xun, and said, “There are three pills in it. Give him a pill every three days. His life isn’t in danger now, but he still needs to rely on himself to recover. Except for a physical examination, he doesn’t need injections, medicines, or infusions.”

“Sure.” Chen Xun took the medicine bottle, then thanked Gu Ning seriously. “Thank you so much!”

“Thank you!” The other soldier thanked her sincerely as well.

“My pleasure. If there is anything wrong with him, call me,” said Gu Ning.

“Thanks,” said Chen Xun and his comrade.

After that, Gu Ning left. Chen Xun wanted to walk her out, but she declined.

The several doctors were still unwilling to accept the result, so they followed Gu Ning out, as did the deputy dean. Although he was biased against Gu Ning earlier, Gu Ning was very excellent at medicines, so he also hoped that she could help their hospital.

Gu Ning didn’t want to waste more time on them, so she sped up and they were unable to catch up with her.

…

After Gu Ning left, Chen Xun shared the news with Leng Shaoting. Because Leng Shaoting knew Gu Ning’s abilities very well, he wasn’t surprised at all.

Finishing the call with Chen Xun, Leng Shaoting called Gu Ning and thanked her for saving his comrade.

Although he didn’t need to thank her because of their close relationship, he shouldn’t take it for granted.

In order to let Leng Shaoting feel better, Gu Ning accepted his gratitude.

…

Before long, the two doctors who had treated Zhou Xing also heard the news, and were amazed too.

However, the doctor who was thrown out by Gu Ning felt very surprised and angry, because it was too humiliating. Therefore, he had an evil idea and hoped that Zhou Xing could die after the treatment.

In that case, he wouldn’t be humiliated and people would believe that he was right. He could criticize Gu Ning afterwards and make her apologize to him.

Unfortunately, the reality was quite the opposite of what he wanted and he had to swallow the humiliation.

What had happened to Zhou Xing soon spread abroad and all of the doctors were surprised. However, they didn’t know this girl’s status. The hospital had asked Chen Xun and his comrade about it, but they refused to tell.

…

After Gu Ning left the hospital, she went to deal with Kuraki Akemi and Kato Toya.

On her way, Gu Ning told K to find out where they were, so she could go to see them. Gu Ning called K and asked for the location of Kuraki Akemi and Kato Toya.

It was time for lunch, so Kuraki Akemi and Kato Toya were dining in a restaurant now. Once Gu Ning heard that, she rushed over.

When she arrived, they had almost finished eating, but didn’t leave yet.

Gu Ning didn’t bother to avoid them and directly sat across them.

When Gu Ning walked near, Kuraki Akemi and Kato Toya saw her. Although they didn’t have bitter grudges against Gu Ning, Gu Ning had ruined their plan once, so they had a bad impression of her. They were unwilling to see her. However, they didn’t go to cause her trouble either.

Besides, they weren’t very familiar, so neither of them greeted each other.

After Gu Ning sat down, she began to order.

After ordering, Gu Ning stared straight at them, releasing cold magical power.

Although the magical power followed her consciousness to the place she wanted it to be, the surroundings would also be affected. Fortunately, there usually weren’t many people in the restaurant in the morning, so it wouldn’t have much impact.

Kuraki Akemi and Kato Toya felt Gu Ning’s look. They were both confused and turned to look at her. They didn’t understand why she was staring at them. However, they soon felt the familiar coldness and panicked. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

They still couldn’t figure out what had happened!

Once they felt something was wrong, they wanted to run away, but they didn’t dare to stand up at all because they were afraid of falling all of a sudden.

Seeing Gu Ning staring at them, they wondered whether it had something to do with Gu Ning.

The moment they had that idea, they felt it was ridiculous. She was only staring at them and had done nothing!

They didn’t know that Gu Ning only needed to stare at them in order to achieve her goal. She didn’t need to use violence.

When they seemed unwell, Gu Ning deliberately asked them with concern, “What happened? Why do you look so uncomfortable?”

They weren’t familiar, but had met twice, so it wasn’t inappropriate for her to ask them that question.

Gu Ning asked them in order to keep on staring at them and so that they wouldn’t be suspicious of her.

“Call an ambulance…” Kato Toya uttered with difficulty, hoping Gu Ning could help them.

“No problem.” Gu Ning agreed with alacrity and took out her phone to call an ambulance.

At the same time, she didn’t stop putting icy magical power into their bodies. Even if they were sent to the hospital, no doctor could treat them. When the hospital couldn’t help them, the hospital would call the police and send them back to their country.

Gu Ning didn’t plan to let them die here, or it might cause trouble, but she was determined to make them suffer. Therefore, she decided to disable them.. They could still live for a while anyway.
