3255 There Is Nothing Between Yuqi and Me

Leng Yuqi refused to tell them and only wanted them to leave. “Go out! You all go out!”

“You can go out. I’ll stay here with Yuqi,” said Song Meiyu. If they all stayed there, Leng Yuqi wouldn’t tell them anything. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Hearing that, the others went out and closed the door, leaving Leng Yuqi and Song Meiyu in the room.

Leng Yuqi didn’t chase Song Meiyu out because she wanted to talk about it with her mother.

“Yuqi, what happened? Tell mom, or mom will be worried about you,” Song Meiyu said.

Leng Yuqi said nothing. She grabbed her phone and asked Song Meiyu to look at it by herself.

After watching the video, Song Meiyu was furious. It turned out that Chu Jianan betrayed Leng Yuqi with her best friend, Jiang Yihan.

“They’re so shameless. How dare they betray you like this? Aren’t they afraid that they’ll be punished? They’re trash!” Song Meiyu swore and her face distorted in anger. It seemed as if she was going to kill them.

When Leng Yuqi was betrayed, Song Meiyu blamed other people. However, when Leng Yuqi betrayed Leng Xiaoyao with Chu Jianan, she supported them and felt that it happened because Leng Yuqi was very charming. It was Leng Xiaoyao’s fault that she wasn’t attractive enough to Chu Jianan.

“Mom, what should I do? What should I do?” asked Leng Yuqi. She was heart-broken at this moment and didn’t know what to do.

“Since Chu Jianan has betrayed you, you can’t be with him any longer, but he must give us an explanation. And your friend, I can’t believe she’s such a bi*ch. How dare she sleep with your boyfriend? Did her parents tell her to do that?” Song Meiyu said furiously. However, she didn’t realize that she was the type of person she was criticizing. Her daughter was also a bi*ch.

After Leng Xiaoyao and the others were locked outside, they didn’t leave right away because they wanted to know what had happened.

Leng Xiaoyao knew, but wouldn’t say it, otherwise she would be exposed.

Leng Yuqi was heart-broken and Song Meiyu was furious, but Leng Xiaoyao had no sympathy for them. She didn’t feel guilty and believed that they deserved it.

They should feel lucky that they were members of the Leng family, so she didn’t punish them seriously for Leng Changyuan’s sake. If they were outsiders, they would have received a much worse punishment.

Knowing why Leng Yuqi cried so sadly, Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng weren’t mad, instead they felt it was a good result.

Even if Chu Jianan didn’t betray Leng Yuqi, Leng Changyuan wouldn’t allow them to be together unless Leng Yuqi cut off her relationship with him.

Nevertheless, they felt that Song Meiyu was shameless too.

“Now Yuqi is going through the same thing as Yaoyao, but she thinks Chu Jianan and the girl are shameless. When Yuqi and Chu Jianan betrayed Leng Yuqi, why didn’t she think they were shameless?” Leng Changyuan snorted. In his eyes, Song Meiyu was the most shameless.

Leng Yehua and Leng Yuchen were embarrassed. Even if they had the same idea as Song Meiyu, they were aware that it was immoral, so they wouldn’t publicly support her.

After learning about the situation, Leng Changyuan didn’t want to stay there any longer. He called Leng Xiaoyao and Leng Yecheng to go downstairs with him. As they walked away, he continued to complain about them.

“When Chu Jianan and Yuqi betrayed Yaoyao, why didn’t they criticize Chu Jianan? I’m not surprised that he betrayed Yuqi now. I simply didn’t expect it to happen so fast,” Leng Changyuan said. He had a very bad impression of Chu Jianan and even felt disgusted by him.

“Leng Yuqi deserves it. I’m very happy right now,” Leng Yecheng said, voice thick with satisfaction.

Leng Changyuan also felt that Leng Yuqi deserved it, but she was his granddaughter, so he didn’t feel pleased no matter how much he disliked her.

…

In Leng Yuqi’s room.

“But I really like him!” said Leng Yuqi. Even if she was very hurt and heart-broken, she couldn’t get over Chu Jianan right away.

If she didn’t like him so much, she wouldn’t have gone against her grandfather and Uncle Yecheng to be together with him.

Song Meiyu had a big frown. “Do you want to forgive him?”

Song Meiyu couldn’t accept it.

“I don’t know. I’ll be in a lot of pain if I have to leave him, but I also can’t accept the fact that he betrayed me with Jiang Yihan,” Leng Yuqi said. She didn’t know what to do.

“I’ll call Chu Jianan right now to see what he says about it,” said Song Meiyu. She immediately picked up Leng Yuqi’s phone and called Chu Jianan. Leng Yuqi didn’t stop her because she also wanted to know what Chu Jianan wanted to say.

Chu Jianan didn’t answer it until Song Meiyu called him the second time. Once he picked up, he said, “What is it? I’m busy right now.”

“You’re busy? Busy doing what? Dating Jiang Yihan? Chu Jianan, what’s going on between you and Jiang Yihan?” Song Meiyu questioned him.

Chu Jianan was struck dumb for a second, but didn’t think that Song Meiyu and Leng Yuqi had already found out about his secret relationship with Jiang Yihan. He thought that Leng Xiaoyao told them about their meeting.

“There is nothing between Jiang Yihan and me. Did Leng Xiaoyao tell you anything? I only hung out with my friends and met Jiang Yihan by chance,” said Chu Jianan. He blamed Leng Xiaoyao for interfering in his business.

Nothing happened these days, so he thought that Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t say that, but unexpectedly she still did that.

“Chu Jianan…” Song Meiyu gritted through her teeth, “I’m talking about your sleeping with Jiang Yihan in the same room. Jiang Yihan has stayed in your apartment several times. Did you think you could keep it a secret from us?”

Chu Jianan was stunned. To his astonishment, they already knew.

Anyway, since they already knew, he didn’t bother to keep it a secret any longer. After all, he already lost interest in Leng Yuqi.

However, he was curious about how they found it out, so he asked, “How do you know that?”

“It’s not important. I need an explanation right now. Have you ever thought about Yuqi’s feelings?” Song Meiyu questioned him again.

“There is nothing between Yuqi and me. Why should I care about her feelings?” Chu Jianan said airily. He refused to admit that there was something between Leng Yuqi and him. Besides, it sounded like he didn’t care about her at all.
