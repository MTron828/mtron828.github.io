Chapter 1153 I Miss You too

“Situ, I’m so sorry that I’m late,” Gu Ning said and apologized to Situ Ye once she arrived.“It’s fine. You’re not very late after all,” Situ Ye said. He actually disliked it when Gu Ning was too polite to him, because it made him feel like they weren’t close. He hoped that Gu Ning could see him as a close friend. However, although they weren’t strangers, they weren’t very familiar with each other either.

After that, they were all seated.

“Oh, I heard that the first film produced by your company was a great success. Congratulations!” Situ Ye said.

Even though he was very busy these days, he still read a lot of news about Gu Ning on the Internet.

“Thanks,” Gu Ning politely said.

“Peihan always wanted to join the entertainment industry, and her performance in the movie has helped her get many fans,” Chu Xuanfeng said.

Although Chu Peihan didn’t have as many fans as the leading actors, it was a success for her to be remembered by many people because of the film.

No matter what Chu Peihan wanted to do, Chu Xuanfeng would support her as long as she didn’t join the Qing Gang or fought all day.

In addition, the Qinghua Organization owned an entertainment company too, so Chu Xuanfeng could protect Chu Peihan from being hurt by unspoken rules. As for what chances or roles Chu Peihan could get, that depended on her.

“Peihan really is suitable for this industry, because she’s beautiful, smart, and talented,” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning didn’t know much about acting, but Lu Zhan had made positive comments about Chu Peihan’s talent.

Lu Zhan had even asked Gu Ning whether this was the first time Chu Peihan had acted in a film, because she had done a very good job.

At the beginning, Chu Peihan made some mistakes, but she soon corrected them under Lu Zhan’s guidance.

Because of Gu Ning, Lu Zhan had added more time to Chu Peihan’s part in the movie.

...

Hearing Gu Ning’s approval of his younger sister, Chu Xuanfeng was satisfied.

They chatted for a short while, before the dishes were placed on the table. They didn’t care much about manners, so they ate while talking with each other.

“Gu Ning, I heard from Adam that you went to the public jade bid in Burma. How was it? Did you get a lot of good jade raw materials?” Situ Ye asked.

“Yeah, it’s not bad, and I indeed bought many high quality jade raw materials,” Gu Ning said.

When Gu Ning met Adam and Aimee at the public jade bid, she did nothing to punish Aimee because she was busy back then.

She didn’t see Aimee afterwards, so she gave it up. However, if she ran into Aimee next time, she wouldn’t promise that she would let her go again.

It was impossible that Gu Ning would forgive her, but she couldn’t kill her either.

After the meal, they separated.

Situ Ye was still occupied with his work, so he had to go back as soon as he finished the meal with Gu Ning.

...

It was still early, but Gu Ning wasn’t interested in entertaining herself outside so late at night.

Therefore, Gu Ning told Gao Yi to drive her back to Clean Water Blue Sky, and Gao Yi along with Qiao Ya went to stay in a hotel. Gao Yi and Qiao Ya didn’t have an apartment there after all. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The car they drove today was a rented car, Gu Ning already told Zhou Zhenghong to prepare a car for her the next day.

Since Gu Ning was in City G now, she definitely had to invite Master Bai and Master Fu to share a meal together, so she decided to call them tomorrow morning.

...

Once she was back in her apartment, she sent Leng Shaoting a message.

About five minutes later, Gu Ning’s phone rang, and the caller was Leng Shaoting.

“Hi, Shaoting, what are you doing now?” Gu Ning picked it up without hesitation.

“I’m missing you,” Leng Shaoting said. Even though they had seen each other that morning, he had already begun to miss her.

Gu Ning smiled happily. “I miss you too.”

After that, Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting that she had dined with Situ Ye today.

She knew that Leng Shaoting would feel a little displeased when he heard that she dined with Situ Ye, but it was unavoidable to meet Situ Ye in City G.

Leng Shaoting understood it as well, so he wasn’t annoyed. He clearly knew that Gu Ning only loved him, and that Situ Ye was only her friend.

Even though they were a loving couple, they still needed their own private space. Gu Ning was a businesswoman after all, so it was very normal for her to expand her connections.

Leng Shaoting wasn’t small-minded, and he didn’t want to lose Gu Ning.

Gu Ning didn’t tell Leng Shaoting that she had encountered a killer, because she was afraid that he might get too worried.

They chatted for about an hour on the phone.

...

After hanging up the call with Leng Shaoting, Gu Ning opened the WeChat group. She hadn’t chatted with her friends for a long time.

Because Gu Ning seldom used WeChat, she often forgot about it.

The moment she opened it, she found thousands of messages in the WeChat group. Many of her friends asked her whether she would come back to City F now that the National College Entrance Examination was around the corner.

Gu Ning was free now, so she began to chat with them.
