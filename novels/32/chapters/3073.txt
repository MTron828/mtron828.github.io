3075 She’s Indeed Sick

Before long, Leng Xiaoyao found information about An Chenjun, then his girlfriend.

An Chenjun’s girlfriend was called Shen Xiyin. She was from City Yun, Province Yun. Her family was involved in the jade jewelry industry, but they weren’t the developer or seller. Her family was only a franchisee. Anyway, her family was rich in the local city and had a billion yuan in wealth.

Shen Xiyin and An Chenjun went to the same university in the capital. As soon as they graduated, they became boyfriend and girlfriend. They had been together for two years, and An Chenjun brought Shen Xiyin home when they had time the other day. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Leng Xiaoyao did a further investigation about Shen Xiyin. She found out the record of Shen Xiyin’s use of her ID card to see where Shen Xiyin had been and what Shen Xiyin had done.

She also read Shen Xiyin’s call record, message record, and chatting record.

It was very easy for a hacker, but now Leng Xiaoyao didn’t have much time to do all of that, so she went to class first. She planned to continue when they had a break at noon.

In the classroom, Leng Xiaoyao said to Xiong Manxin and the others, “I won some money in the stock market. Let me buy you a meal this afternoon. You can order whatever you want to eat.”

“What? Boss, you know how to make money with stocks?”

Knowing that, they were all surprised. But they were aware that Leng Xiaoyao was good at many things, so it wasn’t very shocking.

“Yeah!” Leng Xiaoyao answered.

“Boss, how much did you make?” Wu Minmin asked curiously. It was not only Wu Minmin, the other girls were curious about it too. “Tell us, how much did you win?”

“Five hundred thousand yuan,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t tell them that she had actually made three hundred million yuan. After all, it was too much, and she might get in unnecessary trouble if the news spread.

She wasn’t afraid of trouble, but she disliked it.

“Jesus, five hundred thousand yuan?” The girls exclaimed.

Other students heard them at this moment, and turned to look at them. However, they only heard five hundred thousand yuan, and didn’t know what exactly Leng Xiaoyao and her friends were talking about.

Wu Minmin and the others realized that they shouldn’t have shouted so loudly once the other students turned to look at them. They immediately stared at Leng Xiaoyao with a guilty expression. They didn’t want to cause her any trouble.

“Boss, we didn’t do that on purpose.” Wu Minmin apologized at once.

“Boss…” Gao Lele and the others were also sorry about that.

“It’s fine. They don’t know what we’re talking about,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

The other students only gave them a few glances, then withdrew their sight.

Xiong Manxin was surprised, but wasn’t as surprised as Wu Minmin, because she had watched Leng Xiaoyao make ten million yuan at a time!

However, Leng Xiaoyao told her to keep it a secret, so she couldn’t share the news with them.

After having their morning classes, Leng Xiaoyao saw An Chenmeng again on their way to the canteen.

“Boss, why didn’t An Chenmeng come to ask you to accept her after she met you this time? Did she give up?” Wu Minmin asked.

“Wait a moment. Her face is so pale and her eyes can’t focus. Is she sick?” Xiong Manxin asked.

“I think so. She looks ill,” Gao Lele said.

“Perhaps she’s too uncomfortable to bother Xiaoyao,” Gao Ziyin said.

“You’re right.” Tong Xiaobei agreed.

“She’s indeed sick. I met her when I came to school this morning,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Oh!” The others nodded.

Although they didn’t want to accept An Chenmeng, they wouldn’t stop it if Leng Xiaoyao agreed. After all, Leng Xiaoyao was their boss, so they all listened to her.

At the canteen.

They went to a table at the corner, because Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want other people to see what she was doing.

“Boss, you carry a laptop with you everywhere. Is it because of the stock market?” Xiong Manxin asked. She remembered that Leng Xiaoyao carried her laptop to the circuit as well.

“Yes,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Because she couldn’t tell them that she was a hacker, she had to make up an excuse. “Order whatever you want to eat. I need to do some work.”

As Leng Xiaoyao said that, she turned on her laptop and continued to investigate Shen Xiyin.

“Sure.” The other girls answered and started ordering. They didn’t pay much attention to what Leng Xiaoyao was doing. They knew what respect was.

Precisely because of that, Leng Xiaoyao did the investigation in front of them and didn’t warn them not to come closer.

After ordering, they didn’t bother Leng Xiaoyao and said nothing. Instead, they played on their phones.

They played games, read entertainment news, watched amusing short videos, and read business news.

Suddenly, Tong Xiaobei noticed the news of the turmoil in the stock market yesterday. The next second, she exclaimed. “Jesus, stocks of several large companies suffered a turmoil yesterday. Several people bought many stocks at the lowest prices, then made several hundred million yuan! It’s awesome!”

“What? Several hundred million yuan?”

Hearing that, Xiong Manxin and the other girls were attracted to the news. They were all shocked by it.

“Yes!” Tong Xiaobei nodded heavily.

“Wow, it’s unbelievable. I wish I were one of them.”

“…”

Leng Xiaoyao said nothing and only smiled, because the several people were Li Mochen, Leng Yecheng, and her. It wasn’t surprising for her at all.

“Why did boss just win five hundred thousand yuan instead of several hundred million yuan? If she had won so much money, she could take us on a world tour! At least, we can travel abroad or out of the province,” Xiong Manxin said, feeling that it was a shame that Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t one of the winners.

“Right.” The other girls chimed in.

Leng Xiaoyao rubbed her nose, feeling slightly guilty, because she had indeed won several hundred million yuan, but she couldn’t tell them.

“Forget about traveling around the world or abroad, but it’s easy to travel out of the province. I promise, after the National College Entrance Examination, we can have a journey. As for the destination, you can choose. We can decide the date by then,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t think it was a big issue if they traveled together. After all, she had indeed made a fortune!

In addition, it would only cost her a few thousand yuan if they took a trip for several days. Even if she had only made five hundred thousand yuan, it was enough.

“Really?” The other girls were excited.

“Of course. I would never lie to you,” Leng Xiaoyao said.
