2985 She’s Ugly

Leng Xiaoyao understood why Leng Yuqi said that, so she sneered. “I did it deliberately? Don’t put the blame on me. I wouldn’t do that just because of you. It’s you who disdained me first. I simply wanted to prove you wrong. You agreed, didn’t you? If you didn’t agree, I wouldn’t have forced you to do it.”

In fact, Leng Xiaoyao did it on purpose, but Leng Yuqi deserved it. If Leng Yuqi hadn’t disdained her, she wouldn’t have challenged her.

“You…” Leng Yuqi was mad, but didn’t know what to say, because Leng Xiaoyao was right.

However, she still felt trapped by Leng Xiaoyao, so she was reluctant to accept it.

Uncle Liu didn’t know what they were talking about, but he could see that Leng Yuqi was scared of Leng Xiaoyao now.

He was curious to know the reason, but said nothing.

Neither Leng Xiaoyao nor Leng Yuqi mentioned what had happened in their school. Leng Yuqi didn’t want the other family members to know that Leng Xiaoyao had become so excellent, while Leng Xiaoyao wanted to surprise Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng after her score of the monthly test came out.

…

After Chu Jiayu went back to the Chu family’s house, she saw Chu Jianan and talked to him about Leng Xiaoyao.

“Hey, Jianan, big news. Leng Xiaoyao…”

The moment Chu Jiayu mentioned Leng Xiaoyao, Chu Jianan directly interrupted her. “Why are you bringing her up? I don’t want to hear anything about her.”

Chu Jianan hated Leng Xiaoyao, because it was extremely humiliating when she beat him.

“Fine!” Since Chu Jianan didn’t want to listen, Chu Jiayu didn’t continue.

“What happened?” Chu Zhaofeng asked instead curiously.

“Leng Xiaoyao has completely changed. She isn’t just good at fighting, but is also excellent at studying now. She even helped her classmates review. All of our teachers are complimenting her,” Chu Jiayu said. She totally forgot that Leng Yuqi reminded her not to tell Chu Jianan that Leng Xiaoyao had changed. Because Leng Yuqi didn’t remind her today, she didn’t think much about that.

And what Leng Xiaoyao had done displeased her, so she wanted to complain.

“What?” Chu Zhaofeng was astonished, so were Mrs. Chu and Chu Jianan.

“She suddenly became excellent at studying and even helped her classmates review? And your teachers all complimented her? How is that possible?” Mrs. Chu was shocked and doubted it. She didn’t think a good-for-nothing like Leng Xiaoyao could suddenly become excellent at studying.

As for the fact that she became good at fighting, that wasn’t shocking, because Leng Xiaoyao often fought with other people.

However, they couldn’t accept the fact that Leng Xiaoyao suddenly became an excellent student.

“Many people have watched her class. She has indeed changed,” Chu Jiayu insisted.

“So what? She’s ugly and has done too many bad things,” Chu Jianan said disdainfully.

However, he was lying. Although it seemed as if he still disdained Leng Xiaoyao, he felt uncomfortable because he didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to be excellent.

Leng Xiaoyao was a spoiled and stupid good-for-nothing. He wanted her to be like that forever.

However, that was Leng Xiaoyao’s business. There was no reason for him to judge.

Chu Jianan didn’t want to hear them talking about Leng Xiaoyao any longer, so he went back to his room. Without delay, he sent Leng Yuqi a message on WeChat.

Chu Jianan: What happened to Leng Xiaoyao? I heard from Jiayu that she suddenly became excellent at studying?

Reading Chu Jianan’s message, Leng Yuqi was stunned and angry. At the same time, she blamed Chu Jiayu for telling Chu Jianan.

She wasn’t worried that Chu Jianan might lose interest in her after knowing that Leng Xiaoyao had become excellent, because Leng Xiaoyao was as ugly as always, but she didn’t want Chu Jianan to know about Leng Xiaoyao’s change.

Anyway, since Chu Jiayu already told Chu Jianan and he sent her a message to ask her about it, she had to reply to him.

Leng Yuqi: I don’t know how she suddenly became so good.

Afterwards, Chu Jianan didn’t send Leng Yuqi another message.

Being ignored by Chu Jianan, Leng Yuqi felt very aggrieved.

Therefore, when Chu Jianan didn’t send her a message again after a long while, she sent him another message.

Leng Yuqi: Jianan, why are you so cold to me? Didn’t you say we can stay the same secretly even though we can’t be a couple publicly?

A few minutes later, Chu Jianan replied: I’m not cold to you. I’m in a bad mood these days. Please forgive me. I’ll be better in a few days.

Reading Chu Jianan’s reply, Leng Yuqi felt much better.

Leng Yuqi: Jianan, I can understand. Why don’t we hang out this Sunday?

Reading Leng Yuqi’s message, Chu Jianan actually didn’t want to go, but he decided to accept her invitation after thinking for a while.

Chu Jianan: Sure. Just the two of us. I don’t want Jiayu and Yihan to interrupt us.

They had hung out together with Chu Jiayu and Jiang Yihan many times before, so it wasn’t convenient for him to do anything to Leng Yuqi.

He was a man with desire, so he wanted to do something intimate with his girl when they were together.

Reading Chu Jianan’s reply, Leng Yuqi flushed at once. She had dreamed about kissing, hugging, or even having sex with Chu Jianan.

Although she seemed shy, she still wanted to be closer to Chu Jianan.

If nothing happened between them, they wouldn’t be like a couple.

Leng Yuqi: Of course!

…

An Chenmeng was a good student, but she rarely reviewed. However, she continued to study after she came back home when the evening class was over. She didn’t go to bed until it was late.

An Chenmeng’s behavior was strange in her family’s eyes. It was a good thing that she was willing to spend more time and energy on studying, but it worried them that she suddenly did that.

Therefore, when An Chenmeng was still up at 12:30 am, her parents came over and asked her, “Mengmeng, it’s late now. Why don’t you go to sleep? Even though the monthly test is tomorrow, you don’t need to study so long. If you don’t have a good sleep, you might not have a high score in the test.”

“No, I’m going to compete with Leng Xiaoyao in the monthly test. I don’t want her to surpass me,” An Chenmeng said.
