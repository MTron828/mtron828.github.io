Chapter 2676: Jiang Liluo and Si Jin Take the Job

Gu Ning wanted to seize the chance to make money, and also form a good relationship with York, but Gu Ning didn’t plan to do the job by herself.

She decided to take the task, but wouldn’t do it on her own. Instead, she would let Jiang Liluo and Si Jin do the job. They could complete the task and make a fortune as well.

No matter how much money they would be paid, they could take it and Gu Ning wouldn’t take any.

However, she couldn’t take the offer yet, because she hardly knew anything about York. She at least needed to figure out whether he deserved protection. Therefore, she planned to talk to Leng Yuanqian about it before making the decision.

Although York felt slightly disappointed when Gu Ning turned him down, Gu Ning gave him a chance, so it wasn’t a bad result.

“Sure.” York answered and said nothing more. If he forced Gu Ning to give him a reply right now, Gu Ning might get annoyed and refuse to help him, which wasn’t what he wanted.

Afterwards, they finished the meal and Gu Ning left.

When they separated, Gu Ning opened the box York handed to her. Although she could use her Jade Eyes to see inside of it earlier, she didn’t.

What York gave her was an egg-sized ruby, which was extremely precious and valuable. However, to York, no matter how precious this ruby was, it couldn’t compare to his life. He used it as a gift simply because it was the only precious thing he carried with him at the moment.

Although this ruby was hardly comparable to his life, it was still a valuable gift for Gu Ning.

…

Gu Ning didn’t call Leng Yuanqian and talk to him about York at once, because she was driving and she decided to have that conversation when she got home.

......

When she had nothing else to deal with, she spent most of her time in the siheyuan.

Back in the siheyuan, Gu Ning called Leng Yuanqian. At this moment, Leng Yuanqian was on a break, so it didn’t interrupt his work.

Before Gu Ning told Leng Yuanqian what York wanted her to do for him, she asked Leng Yuanqian about his opinion on York.

Leng Yuanqian said that he wasn’t very familiar with York, but they had a close relationship. Given what he knew about York, York was a good man.

At least he was sure that York wasn’t a backstabber and was reliable.

After Leng Yuanqian said that, he wondered why Gu Ning asked him about York. Did York do something bad? “What happened? Did he do anything wrong?” he asked worriedly.

He didn’t think that York was a bad man and even thought that he was reliable, but other people might think differently.

After all, when people got to a high position, it was hard to say whether they were good people or bad people.

“He invited me out for a meal, and gave me an egg-sized ruby as a gift. In addition to that, he also told me that he’s in a very dangerous situation right now. He’s going to Country F and he asked that I protect him over there. He needs me to stay with him for three days, then protect him on the way back to Country Y. Frankly, he wants me to be his security guard and he’ll pay me a fortune,” said Gu Ning.

Hearing that, Leng Yuanqian was silent for a while, then he asked, “What do you think?”

“I of course want to seize the chance and make money, but I won’t go. I can send someone who isn’t any worse than me. However, I coincidentally heard the mayor call him Marquis yesterday. Given his status, I think it won’t do me any harm to form a good relationship with him. What I want to know right now is whether he’s a good man. Does he deserve my help? I needed to ask you that before I decide whether to help him,” said Gu Ning.

Leng Yuanqian remained silent for a while, then said, “Well, we actually need his cooperation for a project. If you need my advice, I hope that you can do this job for him. It’s not difficult for you. You just need to protect him for a few days. And you can make money doing it. We can also build a close relationship with him. If we need him in the future, he’ll be willing to help us as well. So, we can gain a lot from that.”

Hearing that, Gu Ning made up her mind. Now she just needed to see whether York was willing to go with her people instead of herself.

“Great, I’ll ask him whether he’s willing to go with my people,” said Gu Ning.

Gu Ning didn’t call York immediately after hanging up with Leng Yuanqian. She waited for a while, otherwise it would make her seem eager to please him.

Gu Ning didn’t call York until 3 pm.

“Mr. York, I can help you with security, but I’m afraid I can’t do it myself, because I need to deal with something else. I can only arrange for my people to protect you. They’re better than me, and I can send two of them to make sure that you’re safe. If anything happens, they can deal with it. Only if the trouble is too serious, where even I won’t be able to handle it, will they become helpless. If you can accept that, they will go with you. If not, I’m afraid I can’t help,” said Gu Ning.

York remained silent for a few seconds, then he said, “I just need security. If it can be assured, I don’t mind.”

York only needed security, so since Gu Ning said that her people were even better than her, he could accept it.

“Great, then it’s a deal. May I know how much you are willing to pay them?” Gu Ning asked. Since it was a deal, they had to be clear about the details first. No one wanted to have conflicts afterwards.

“Fifty million yuan, what do you think?” York said.

“Deal!” said Gu Ning. She was very satisfied with that, because it was a very generous offer for two security guards.

Just like that, they struck the deal. After the call with York, Gu Ning called Jiang Liluo and assigned the task to them.

They were security guards now, so they happily took the job. After all, they could get a fortune from it.

Therefore, it was Jiang Liluo’s job now.

As for their passports, Leng Shaoting had helped them with it when he applied for ID cards for them. He knew the passport would come in handy one day.

And now they really needed it.
