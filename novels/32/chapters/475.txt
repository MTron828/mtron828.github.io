Chapter 477 Visitors At Home

They exchanged a glance at first, then they all ran at Gu Ning. Gu Ning enjoyed beating them for a long time to vent her anger, but she kept them alive.

In the following minutes, those men were screaming in pain under Gu Ning’s attack. Let alone others outside of the basement, even Chu Xuanfeng felt a little frightened.

Around 20 minutes later Gu Ning had had enough and the men were all black and blue.

“I’m done. Let’s go!” Gu Ning walked out directly without giving them a glance.

When they were outside Gu Ning said, “Xuanfeng, thank you so much for your help, but I have visitors coming to my home today, so please let me buy you a meal another day!”

“You don’t need to thank me at all. I should say sorry to you instead, and I’d love to meet you for the meal,” Chu Xuanfeng said. He then gave Gu Ning a USB flash disk and a check of a million yuan. “There is evidence on the USB flash disk about this mess and the check is your compensation.”

“Thanks, but please take the check back. I’ll make the person who hired them pay me,” Gu Ning said with determination.

Chu Xuanfeng understood that Gu Ning was determined, so he took the check back.

“I will also tell all the members in the Qing Gang not to bother you anymore, and I promise it won’t happen again,” Chu Xuanfeng said seriously to Gu Ning.

“Thanks, bye,” Gu Ning said, then left.

After Gu Ning was gone, Chu Xuanfeng informed everyone in the Qing Gang to not assault but protect Gu Ning’s companies and those who had a close relationship with her.

It wasn’t early when Gu Ning separated from Chu Xuanfeng, so she decided to go home first and deal with Qin Lilin, who was the owner of Meiyan Beauty Salon tomorrow.

When Gu Ning got home, Gu Man and Gu Qing were about to do grocery shopping.

Gu Qinyang and his wife left the court at 4 pm. Because of Gu Xiaoxiao, Gu Qinxiang and his wife had no mood to treat Gu Qinyang and his wife. Therefore, Gu Qinyang and his wife took a taxi to Gu Qing’s home.

They knew that Gu Ning was rich, so they weren’t surprised when they found out that they lived in Fenghua Luxury Mansion, but they were still envious of them, because Fenghua was a high-end living area. However, they didn’t feel jealousy or had animosity towards Gu Ning, because they understood that Gu Ning wasn’t someone that they could annoy now.

Gu Qinyang and his wife went to a supermarket and bought some fruits and flowers as gifts. Although the gifts weren’t expensive, they didn’t want to visit Gu Qing and Gu Man with empty hands. After that, they went to Gu Qing’s home.

They would have dinner at Gu Qing’s apartment, so Gu Qing and Gu Man were busy cooking after grocery shopping. Jiang Xu was also home earlier today because Gu Qinyang and his wife were going to visit them.

When Gu Qinyang and Wen Yulan were approaching Gu Qing’s home, they felt quite nervous because there was a clear gap between them, Gu Qing, and Gu Man now. Therefore, they hesitated for a few minutes outside before they rang the doorbell.

Jiang Xu went to open the door, and Gu Qinyang and his wife greeted him at once, “Hi, brother-in-law!”

Jiang Xu hadn’t heard them call him brother-in-law in a long time, because they hadn’t shown any respect towards him in the past. Gu Qinyang and his wife also knew it, and felt embarrassed now, facing Jiang Xu.

Jiang Xu, on the other hand, warmly welcomed them like nothing unpleasant had happened before. “Hi, come on in!”

Gu Qinyang and Wen Yulan then walked inside. They took a glance around the apartment and saw that it was much better than their own place.

Gu Qing and Gu Man walked out of the kitchen when they heard Gu Qinyang and his wife’s voices. “Welcome! Please have a seat.”

“Have a seat please. It will take a while before the dishes are on the table.”

“Can I help?” Wen Yulan asked and walked to the kitchen. Wen Yulan didn’t act arrogant at all but behaved kindly.

“That would be great!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Although Gu Qing and Gu Man didn’t actually need help, they didn’t reject, because it was a good way for them to be reconciled. Gu Qing and Gu Man didn’t show any disrespect to Wen Yulan, nor show off in front of her, but kept chatting with her casually.

It was the first time that Wen Yulan had felt the warm conversations among relatives, and she felt ashamed for what she had done to Gu Qing and Gu Man before. After a long breath, Wen Yulan apologized with sincerity, “Gu Qing, Gu Man, I’m so sorry for what I did to you before.”

“It’s all gone, and we don’t need to talk about it anymore.”

“Exactly, and we’re glad that we have a good relationship now.”

Gu Qing and Gu Man forgave Wen Yulan, and Wen Yulan felt lucky that they were kind enough to forgive her.

In the living room, Gu Qinyang was talking with Jiang Xu about what had happened in the court today. Gu Xiaoxiao was sentenced to three years in jail and her family had to pay six hundred thousand yuan to Chen Ziyao as compensation.

Jiang Xu sighed after hearing that. Although Gu Qinxiang’s family had hurt them deeply, Jiang Xu still felt a little sad. At the same time, he also believed that Gu Xiaoxiao had to learn her lesson sooner or later.

Before long, Gu Ning and Jiang Xinyue got home.

“Hi, uncle.” Gu Ning and Jiang Xinyue greeted Gu Qinyang politely. They didn’t show any disrespect towards Gu Qinyang, but they weren’t close to him either. Although they were relatives, they didn’t share many good memories.
