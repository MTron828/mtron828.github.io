3141 Xiao Yuzhe Gives in

“But there must be a bet, so that it’ll be interesting. If you can successfully strike up a conversation with her, I’ll buy you a meal. If not, you’ll buy us a meal. How is it?” One man suggested. Although the bet was nothing for them, it wouldn’t be interesting if there wasn’t a bet.

“No problem.” Xiao Yuzhe agreed. He also thought it would be fun with a bet.

Therefore, they walked towards Leng Xiaoyao.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t know Mo Jingxuan, but Ling Tianqi and the others had a relationship with him. Accordingly, as Mo Jingxuan and his friends walked over, Ling Tianqi and the others greeted them.

“Hi, Mr. Mo.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Upon hearing the way Ling Tianqi and the others greeted Mo Jingxuan, Leng Xiaoyao figured out who he was.

If he was born in the Mo family and Xiao Yuzhe was with him, Li Mochen should know him too. Perhaps Li Mochen came to Master Mo’s birthday party because of him.

It was just a guess since the Mo family might be in the same faction as Li Mochen.

“Hi, Mr. Ling, Mr. Pei, and Mr. Feng.” Mo Jingxuan replied. Although he rarely showed up at a party, he was familiar with many members of high society.

Even though Xiao Yuzhe and the other young men were good-looking, Xiong Manxin stayed calm because she had seen Li Mochen and the others who were much more handsome.

She gave them a few glances, but didn’t lose her calm like she had done at the meeting with Li Mochen and the others.

“Miss, nice to see you, you look stunning today. I noticed you at a glance in this crowded hall. Can I know your name?” asked Xiao Yuzhe gently.

Leng Xiaoyao had already heard their conversation, and felt displeased by their discussion, so she didn’t want Xiao Yuzhe to succeed, but she still replied to him. They only said that if Xiao Yuzhe could successfully have a nice conversation with her, he would win. If she didn’t talk to him nicely, he couldn’t win.

“Countless men have been stunned by me. Even if you want to chase me, I don’t think you’re qualified enough to stand in the line,” Leng Xiaoyao said arrogantly. Her attitude was obviously bad.

Xiao Yuzhe was embarrassed. He didn’t expect Leng Xiaoyao to be so arrogant.

Mo Jingxuan and the other man felt amused. Although they were also surprised by Leng Xiaoyao’s reply, they indeed didn’t think Xiao Yuzhe could succeed. Therefore, they were happy to see Leng Xiaoyao reject him.

Ling Tianqi and the others didn’t know why Leng Xiaoyao did that, but they didn’t ask, because they understood that Leng Xiaoyao must be doing that for a reason.

“Miss, you broke my heart. I have no bad intentions. I simply want to make friends with you,” Xiao Yuzhe said, pretending to be sad. Honestly, he felt it was more interesting when Leng Xiaoyao rejected him.

“But I don’t want to be friends with you,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Why not?” asked Xiao Yuzhe.

“I heard your conversation. Why did you bet on me? Why did you gamble on whether I’ll nicely talk to you? Do you think I’ll have a good impression of you and nicely talk to you after hearing your discussion?” Leng Xiaoyao pointed the truth out.

“What? You heard our conversation?”

Xiao Yuzhe and his friends were shocked. He subconsciously asked that question, which meant it was true.

There was a distance between them and it was noisy in the hall. How could she hear their discussion? It was unbelievable!

Ling Tianqi and the others were also annoyed. How could they make fun of Leng Xiaoyao like that?

“Mr. Mo, isn’t that too much?” Ling Tianqi questioned in annoyance. Although the Ling family wasn’t comparable to the Mo family, it didn’t mean he was afraid of the Mo family.

What they did was humiliating.

“We were just joking. No need to be so serious.” Mo Jingxuan was also slightly embarrassed, but didn’t give up.

“Oh, do you know Li Mochen?” asked Leng Xiaoyao suddenly.

Xiao Yuzhe and his friends were struck dumb for a second. Since Leng Xiaoyao asked that, she must know Li Mochen.

“Do you know him?” asked Mo Jingxuan.

“Of course, he’s my support. So I’ll tell him what you did when he shows up later. I must let him teach you a lesson for me,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Xiao Yuzhe was immediately scared. He didn’t know whether Leng Xiaoyao was telling the truth, but she looked serious. Therefore, if Leng Xiaoyao really told Li Mochen and he defended her, they would be punished.

Thinking of that, Xiao Yuzhe was frightened. Whether Leng Xiaoyao really had a relationship with Li Mochen, he had to apologize right now. Therefore, he smiled to flatter Leng Xiaoyao. “Miss, I’m so sorry. We didn’t know that you are Mochen’s friend. We were just joking. Please don’t take it seriously. I don’t think he needs to know, alright?”

Xiao Yuzhe didn’t make a big fuss over a minor issue, but Li Mochen was indeed temperamental. He didn’t want to train during a vacation.

Seeing that, everyone was curious about the reason why he was so scared of Li Mochen.

Xiong Manxin asked curiously, “Why are you so scared of Mr. Li?”

Xiao Yuzhe and the others stiffened a little. Why were they so scared of Li Mochen? Because he was their head. With a simple sentence, he could make them exhausted.

However, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t actually plan to let Li Mochen teach them a lesson for her. She only scared them for fun.

Therefore, she didn’t continue when Xiao Yuzhe changed his attitude upon hearing Li Mochen’s name. “I’m just joking too. Why are you so serious?”

When they heard the same sentences, they were struck dumb, but Leng Xiaoyao said she was joking, so they relaxed.

“Um, we need to deal with other things right now. See you later,” Mo Jingxuan said. Because it was embarrassing, he didn’t know how to face Leng Xiaoyao.

“Oh, right, we can meet again after Mochen comes,” Xiao Yuzhe said.
