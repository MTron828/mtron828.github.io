Chapter 1468: The Girl with Qi Ziyue

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Dongfang Ziyu learned the basic information about Gu Ning first, which included her name, address, place of birth etc. She also found out that Gu Ning was the top scorer of this year’s National College Entrance Examination.

And other than that, Gu Ning also had many profitable companies under her name. Gu Ning was very young, but she already became a billionaire.

In addition to that, there was a lot of news about her brave deeds on the Internet as well. She had saved many people’s lives before, and videos as well as pictures of her brave deeds abounded on social media.

Moreover, Dongfang Ziyu also found out that the beautiful office building was under Gu Ning’s name and it was the headquarters of her business group. She had an expensive house in Century City too.

Although Gu Ning had more achievements than the above, Dongfang Ziyu wasn’t a hacker and couldn’t find out everything about her.

Nevertheless, after reading the above information about Gu Ning, both Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua were shocked.

To their astonishment, Gu Ning was able to become a billionaire at such an early age. She was a kung fu master as well!

In that case, Gu Ning was a very strong match. However, no matter how strong Gu Ning was, she wasn’t comparable to cultivators. After all, Dongfang Ziyu was very outstanding among cultivators. Therefore, even though Dongfang Ziyu admitted that Gu Ning was a kung fu master, she didn’t think that Gu Ning was able to notice them when they were following her. She only made a decision to be more careful when she went to spy on Gu Ning in the future.

“Wow, she’s really incredible.” Wu Shunhua was amazed too.

He wasn’t as outstanding as Dongfang Ziyu. In fact, Dongfang Ziyu was much better than him, so he didn’t have much confidence in himself, so although he didn’t think Gu Ning could defeat him either, he took her more seriously.

Dongfang Ziyu took Gu Ning lightly only because she didn’t know more details about Gu Ning’s achievements. Her cultivation was in the period of turning qi into energy and she wasn’t the top cultivator.

If she could reach the top level of cultivation, her strength and skills would be greatly enhanced. In addition, she could stay young and beautiful forever.

Dongfang Ziyu was only in the primary period of turning qi into energy, and it was super difficult for her to go up to the next level. She had been stuck in the current period for almost a year now.

Even though Baili Zongyang, the well-known and talented cultivator in the cultivation world, was in the same period as her, he had already reached the middle period. Therefore, Baili Zongyang was much stronger than Dongfang Ziyu, and Gu Ning probably couldn’t defeat him even if she had the flood dragon’s help.

Leng Shaoting was at the early stage of turning the power into qi, which was the base of the next level. Once he had enough experience, he would be able to see what mortals couldn’t.

In other words, he would see ghosts and monsters like Gu Ning could. All cultivators could do that.

“So what? She’s simply a mortal.” Dongfang Ziyu frowned with dissatisfaction. In her eyes, mortals were inferior to cultivators.

Without any reason, Dongfang Ziyu somewhat disliked Gu Ning. Although Gu Ning was only a mortal, she couldn’t help comparing herself with Gu Ning.

Wu Shunhua closed his mouth at once, because he could see that Dongfang Ziyu didn’t like Gu Ning.

...

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya indeed got something useful.

Gao Yi was spying on Qi Ziyue, and took a video of him talking with a girl. They were drinking together, but the girl got drunk quickly, so Qi Ziyue proposed to drive her home. Afterwards, they got in the car but Qi Ziyue didn’t start it.

Gao Yi had secretly set a miniature camera and an audio recorder in the sealing tape of the front windshield of Qi Ziyue’s car. The camera was able to clearly film everything happening in the car, but the audio recorder probably couldn’t record the voices due to the thick glass.

Gao Yi then waited aside to see what would happen.

Without delay, Qi Ziyue pushed the girl down and pressed on her before they had sex right in the car.

The car shook for several minutes then stopped, because they didn’t want others to find out what they were doing.

After the casual sex, the girl threw herself into Qi Ziyue’s arms and cried, “Ziyue, you’re going to be married tomorrow! What should I do? Do we have to leave each other?”

The girl wasn’t pretending; she literally was heart-broken.

“Even if I’m married, we can still be together, but we can’t meet often. Don’t worry, I already told you that I don’t like Tang Yaxin at all and I’m only marrying her to steal the Tang family’s property and take my revenge. Once I finish that, I’ll divorce her and marry you,” Qi Ziyue said with sincerity. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

It was recorded by the audio recorder, because he didn’t bother to lower his voice.

“I know you won’t abandon me, but I just feel sad. No matter what happens, you have my support!” the girl said.

After that, Qi Ziyue drove the girl home.
