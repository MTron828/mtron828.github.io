Chapter 2631: What If He Doesn’t Take It?

“Of course not, it’s your right to eat whatever you like, but Miss Chen, can you tell me why you suddenly fell in love with salad with raw chicken blood?” asked Gu Ning.

Hearing that, the actress panicked a little, bef9re she forced herself to calm down and said, “I ate with my friend outside. She ordered that dish and said it’s good for my skin. I was forced to have a taste, then I fell in love with it.”

Although it was a perfunctory answer, she still said something honest. It was good for her skin.

Ever since she ate salad with raw chicken blood every day, her skin indeed got much better and she was addicted to it now.

“Miss Chen, although it has nothing to do with me, you’re in my crew now. I think I need to deal with any bad news for the sake of our reputation,” said Gu Ning.

The actress was a little displeased. She didn’t think Gu Ning had noticed anything abnormal, instead she believed that other people in the crew disliked her habit of eating salad with raw chicken blood. “Chairman Gu, can’t I choose what to eat?”

“Miss Chen, it’s not about the food. Are you deliberately keeping it a secret from me, or do you really have no idea about it?” Gu Ning said, watching the actress. It seemed that she had already seen through her.

The actress was slightly scared and immediately avoided Gu Ning’s eyes.

No way! Did Gu Ning really see something abnormal about her?

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” The actress played dumb. No matter what Gu Ning said or knew, she couldn’t admit it now.

Nevertheless, her reaction betrayed her. She was lying, or perhaps she didn’t think it was a big deal.

“If you refuse to admit it, I’ll just point it out. Who gave you the black jade pendant? Who told you to eat raw chicken blood? You’re not in love with it. You’re addicted to it. You’ll be uncomfortable all over if you stop eating it, right?” asked Gu Ning.

Hearing that, the actress was shocked and subconsciously covered the black jade pendant on her chest. She lowered her head and gave it a glance, then looked at Gu Ning in astonishment.

......

How did Gu Ning know that she was wearing a black jade pendant? She wore it under her clothing. Other people shouldn’t be able to see it.

However, when she realized that she shouldn’t have touched the pendant, it was too late.

The actress wanted to say something, but didn’t know what to say.

“Will you pay with the rest of your life just for several years of beauty?” Gu Ning asked with a vague smile.

“No…” The actress denied it at once. She wanted to stay beautiful, but was unwilling to die young.

“No? But it’s what you’re doing right now,” said Gu Ning.

“What?” Hearing that, the actress rounded her eyes in horror. She didn’t think Gu Ning was speaking nonsense, because what she was doing right now was indeed creepy, but she didn’t know about the consequences which Gu Ning just told her about.

“It’s not a problem that you like salad with raw chicken blood, because it’s just a common dish. However, this jade pendant is the key problem. It’s an evil thing. And the raw chicken blood you’re eating actually isn’t going into your stomach, it is being absorbed by it. This jade pendant can keep you beautiful, but only for several years at most. It’s also possible that you’ll die in a year or two,” said Gu Ning. She had no right to interfere in the actress’s preference, but she had to deal with it since the actress was working in her crew now.

She could help this actress get rid of it and the actress could continue to do her work, or Gu Ning would replace her.

Upon hearing that, the actress was scared. If that was the case, she wouldn’t wear this jade pendant any longer. Therefore, she immediately pulled it off and dumped it on the ground. Looking at the jade pendant, she was terrified.

“I-Is that true?” Afterwards, the actress asked Gu Ning. Although she wasn’t sure whether Gu Ning told the truth, she was indeed frightened.

“Of course, no need to ask me how I know that. There are a lot of things in this world that can’t be explained by science, like what you know and have experienced. After wearing this black jade pendant and drinking raw chicken blood, you can become beautiful,” said Gu Ning. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The actress knew and had experienced that. After she put on this black jade pendant and drank raw chicken blood, she indeed became beautiful, which couldn’t be explained by science.

She chose to believe Gu Ning instead of the person who gave her this black jade pendant, because she became weird after wearing this black jade pendant. She started to lose her temper easily and even lose control of herself.

Sometimes, she was even scared of herself when she looked at her cold and creepy eyes in the mirror.

Besides, she had nightmares these days. In the dreams, she was chased by monsters and ghosts. She had to run and run all the time, which was absolute torture! However, in order to keep her beauty, she lived with it.

However, after hearing Gu Ning’s words, she couldn’t stand it any longer.

“Will I be fine after I stop wearing this black jade pendant and drinking raw chicken blood?” asked the actress with anticipation. She hoped that Gu Ning could help her out!

“No, you must return this black jade pendant to the person who gave it to you,” said Gu Ning. In fact, it wasn’t necessary, but Gu Ning wanted to know who the person was.

It couldn’t be an ordinary person, so Gu Ning guessed that it was highly likely that it was an evil cultivator.

“B-But what if he doesn’t want it back?” asked the actress, feeling that it might be difficult. Most importantly, the man was very scary, and she didn’t dare to see him again.

“If you need help, I can help you, but you must take me to see the person. If not, you can make the decision on your own,” said Gu Ning.

“I need your help!” said the actress at once. Then she begged Gu Ning. “Miss Gu, please help me out. I don’t want to die. I want to live. I won’t use these creepy things to achieve anything again in the future. I’ll rely on myself to have a better future. Miss Gu, please help me!”
