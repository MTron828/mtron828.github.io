Chapter 610 Shameless Lin Tianyou

The young girl was famous among Su Tongnuo’s fans, so she had many followers, and the majority were Su Tongnuo’s fans too. Therefore, once she posted the photos on Weibo, she received many comments within seconds.

“Ah! Why didn’t you tell me you went to wait for the two goddesses!”

“You’re so lucky!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Wow, they are so beautiful!”

“Is Goddess Gu not wearing any make-up? She looks so beautiful without make-up. I wonder how stunning she will be if she put some on!”

“Indeed! She’s a natural beauty without make-up.”

“Her skin looks so good!”

“I think I’ll go to wait outside of the building tomorrow too. Wish me good luck!”

“I’ll go with you!”

Many fans were excited to meet Su Tongnuo.

“I’m sorry to tell you this, but the shooting is already over, so Goddess Su won’t come tomorrow.”

“What? No! How do you know that?”

“It’s a secret, but I promise it’s true.”

“Do you work for Tanghuang Entertainment?”

Many fans asked the person who leaked the information whether she worked for Tanghuang Entertainment, but she wouldn’t answer it.

It was still early, so Su Tongnuo wanted to fly back, in case she would waste more time here. Gu Ning didn’t stop her and sent her a thick red envelope. As for the fee for being the spokesperson, the company would transfer it to her later after they signed the contract.

Su Tongnuo wasn’t worried about it, because she trusted Gu Ning.

Afterwards, Gu Ning booked two plane tickets for her and her assistant, then went to dine with Yu Zi.

Gu Ning’s car was quite noticeable, so Lin Tianyou who was waiting for the green traffic light at the road saw them clearly. He was sure now that Yu Zi didn’t have a rich boyfriend, but a rich boss. If they weren’t close, Yu Zi wouldn’t have followed Gu Ning all the way.

Without hesitation, Lin Tianyou turned his car and followed Gu Ning’s.

At the beginning, Gu Ning didn’t discover him, but she noticed the same car following behind from the rearview mirror after a few turns. She was suspicious and used her Jade Eyes, then found out that it was Lin Tianyou. There was heavy traffic on the road, so Gu Ning allowed him to follow her.

“Is your boyfriend still bothering you?” Gu Ning asked Yu Zi.

Yu Zi was struck dumb for a second, because she didn’t know why Gu Ning suddenly asked that, but she still answered, “Yeah, but I’ve hung up every time he called me.” She already blacklisted Lin Tianyou’s number, but he always called her using different numbers.

“Does he know the addresses of your store and your apartment?” Gu Ning asked. If he knew, she was worried that Yu Zi could be harassed.

“He doesn’t. We’ve broken up for a year and a half, and my store was located in another shopping mall before. I moved it to Fengshang Shopping Mall after I broke up with him, and I also moved into a new apartment,” Yu Zi said.

In fact, she had already forgotten Lin Tianyou because they had been broken up for a year and a half, which wasn’t a short time. However, once she saw him, she couldn’t help but remember his betrayal, which aroused her hatred.

Yu Zi added, “We barely contacted each other during the past year and a half. Even if we encountered one another on the street, we pretended to be strangers.”

“He’s following us,” Gu Ning said.

“What?” Yu Zi was shocked. She didn’t expect that Lin Tianyou would stalk them. “Why is he doing that?” She was mad.

“Let’s see!” Gu Ning said, but her mood wasn’t affected.

“Boss, I’m sorry,” Yu Zi apologized.

“It’s fine,” Gu Ning said.

Lin Tianyou followed Gu Ning and Yu Zi all the way to the parking lot of Fengshang Shopping Mall. They got out at the same time.

“Yu Zi!”

Once Yu Zi got out of Gu Ning’s car, Lin Tianyou called her name, in case she would walk away.

Since Gu Ning said that she was curious what Lin Tianyou would do, Yu Zi didn’t walk away, but faced him.

“What?” Yu Zi didn’t look at Lin Tianyou at all and asked coldly.

“Well...” Lin Tianyou didn’t know what to say all of a sudden, because he actually had no idea why he stalked her. “Well... Um...”

“If you don’t mind, we’ve gotta go.” Yu Zi lost her patience, turning around walking away.

“Wait a second!” Lin Tianyou dashed to Yu Zi and stopped her.

“Well, I bet this lady must be the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry, right?” Lin Tianyou looked to Gu Ning and tried to please her.

“Yes,” Gu Ning said.

The atmosphere became very embarrassing in Lin Tianyou’s eyes, but Yu Zi and Gu Ning were at ease.

“Anything else?” Yu Zi asked.

“Um, I really admire Miss Gu for your unbelievable achievements. It’s dinner time now. Will you do me the honor of accompanying me to dinner?” Lin Tianyou said, trying to strike up a relationship with Gu Ning.

“I don’t dine with strangers,” Gu Ning said directly.

Lin Tianyou felt very embarrassed, but it wasn’t a surprising answer. He and Gu Ning were strangers after all. However, he wasn’t willing to give up. “Miss Gu, people all become friends from strangers. And Yu Zi is my friend, so her friend is, of course, my friend too.” Lin Tianyou was very shameless to say that.
