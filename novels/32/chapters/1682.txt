Chapter 1683: Compared Her with the Photos

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Yu Yin and several of her friends were coincidentally dining at Mountain River Restaurant today, but she just arrived because of the traffic jam. It was only 6:30 pm now, so the meal wasn’t ready yet.

Yu Yin just parked her car well outside Mountain River Restaurant when Jing Yunyao and Jing Jining walked to the door after having a meal. She didn’t leave her car, then saw Jing Yunyao.

In an instant, Yu Yin was shocked.

I-Isn’t that Yunyao? How is it possible? Isn’t Yunyao already dead?

Yu Yin couldn’t believe her eyes. Because she was too shocked, Yu Yin didn’t have any reaction. When she finally realized it, Jing Yunyao was gone.

Yu Yin immediately got out of her car, trying to find Jing Yunyao, but failed. She wasn’t sure whether she was right, so she went back to her car and checked the driving recorder at once.

The driving recorder recorded everything. Although it was small, it was very clear, so Yu Yin was able to clearly see Jing Yunyao’s face this time. She closely resembled Yunyao, but looked much younger. However, Yu Yin also looked much younger than her real age, so she didn’t jump to a negative conclusion.

Yunyao didn’t know whether the woman was really Yunyao. Maybe they just looked alike. She had witnessed Yunyao’s funeral with Leng Shaoting’s father a dozen years ago after all.

Anyway, Yu Yin couldn’t put it aside, then she took a picture of Jing Yunyao in the driving recorder and decided to show it to Master Leng and Leng Yuanzhen when she was home.

...

After having the meal with Shangguan Yang in the siheyuan, Gu Ning went back home at 8 pm.

Yu Yin also left Mountain River Restaurant for her home at about 8 pm.

In the Leng family’s old house, Master Leng, Leng Shaoxi and Leng Shaoxun were watching TV and chatting with each other in the living room.

Once Yu Yin was home, she asked, “Shaoxun, where is your father?”

“In the study,” said Leng Shaoxun.

“Tell him to come downstairs. I have something to talk to him about,” said Yu Yin.

“Alright.” Leng Shaoxun went upstairs then.

Master Leng felt that Yu Yin was different today, so he asked, “What’s up? Did anything bad happen?”

“Father, I have something important to talk about with you and Yuanzhen. Can we go to your study?” Yu Yin didn’t want more people to hear about it before they figured it out.

Master Leng was struck dumb for a second, then realized that it had to be complicated, so he stood up. “Sure, let’s go!”

Afterwards, Master Leng walked to his study.

Yu Yin, instead, was waiting for Leng Yuanzhen. In a short while, Leng Yuanzhen showed up and asked her with confusion, “Why do you have to see me downstairs?”

“Let’s go to father’s study to discuss it now,” said Yu Yin, then walked towards Master Leng’s study.

Hearing that, Leng Yuanzhen understood that they were going to have a meeting with Master Leng about something important. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

When the three of them went to Master Leng’s study, Leng Shaoxun and Leng Shaoxi were left in the living room with curiosity.

“What does mother want to talk with father and grandfather about?” asked Leng Shaoxi.

“Did father do anything wrong? Maybe mother found out and wants to question him,” said Leng Shaoxun.

“No!” Leng Shaoxi was surprised and couldn’t believe it.

“Why don’t we go to eavesdrop outside the door?” Leng Shaoxun proposed. He was curious about what it was.

“Forget it. We’ll be punished if we’re exposed.” Leng Shaoxi was timid, and didn’t dare to do that.

Since Leng Shaoxi said that, Leng Shaoxun gave up too. They were mostly afraid of their grandfather.

In the study, once Leng Yuanzhen came, Yu Yin told him to close the door.

“What’s wrong?” asked Leng Yuanzhen afterwards.

“I went to have a meal with my friends at Mountain River Restaurant today, and I coincidentally saw a woman who closely resembles Yunyao,” said Yu Yin.

“What?”

Hearing that, both Master Leng and Leng Yuanzhen were astonished.

“I know that Yunyao already passed away over a dozen years ago, and she probably only looks like Yunyao, but it’s still quite unbelievable. I felt anxious, so I took a photo of her. Here, you can have a look,” said Yu Yin and took out her phone to show the photo to Master Leng.

Master Leng took her phone and Leng Yuanzhen moved closer too.

After a simple glance, Master Leng and Leng Yuanzhen were totally taken aback.

“They look the same!” Master Leng and Leng Yuanzhen agreed with Yu Yin.

“Yin, you can go to Yunhan’s room and get their album to have a comparison,” said Master Leng.

Even though they looked very similar in photos, 15 years had passed and they couldn’t remember Yunyao’s face clearly now. Moreover, Master Leng wanted to make sure of it although he didn’t believe that this woman could be Yunyao.

“No problem,” said Yu Yin and left right away.

“Maybe she simply looks like Yunyao. There are many people who look alike in this world,” said Leng Yuanzhen. He didn’t believe that this woman could be Yunyao either, because he also witnessed their funeral. Besides, if this woman was really Yunyao, why didn’t she come back to the Leng family? And who was the woman who died together with Leng Yuanhan?

“I know, but we still need to make sure of it,” said Master Leng.

Although Leng Shaoxun and Leng Shaoxi didn’t dare to eavesdrop outside the door, they were curious all the time, so they kept staring at the direction of Master Leng’s study. Once Yu Yin walked out, Leng Shaoxun asked, “Mom, what are you talking about with dad and grandpa?”

“It’s adults’ business!” Yu Yin criticized him, then went upstairs in a hurry.

“Is it really because my father has done something wrong?” Leng Shaoxun thought it was possible, because Yu Yin didn’t look happy and she probably ran upstairs to cry in her room.

Thinking of that, Leng Shaoxun followed up at once because he was worried about Yu Yin. Leng Shaoxi did the same thing.

Yu Yin didn’t know how to explain it and snapped at him, “Nonsense! Watch your TV shows and don’t follow me up. I only need to find something upstairs.”

Yunyao didn’t want them to know her real purpose, because she was afraid that Leng Shaoting might find out too.

“Fine!”

Seeing that, Leng Shaoxun and Leng Shaoxi stopped.
