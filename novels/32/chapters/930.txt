933 Kept as a Lover

Although Fan Sixuan had given a lot of money to them, they knew that she still had a lot of savings. Since she was going to be put in jail, they thought that they had the right to use her savings.

Moreover, Fan Sixuan also owned a house in City B, and her younger brother was going to be married, so her parents planned to let her transfer the house to her younger brother’s name.

Fan Sixuan’s parents were really shameless!

In the past, Fan Sixuan’s family lived an ordinary life in a small town, but everything changed once she got famous.

Her family used her money to buy big houses and luxurious cars. All they knew was to waste her money, and none of them had a job.

Fan Sixuan almost gave half of her income to her family every year, in case her family argued against her and ruined her reputation.

...

Several policemen and policewomen along with a doctor went to the Huangdeng Hotel to examine Tang Xiaoxiao’s injuries. The general manager of the hotel was also present.

When the policewomen and the doctor were examining Tang Xiaoxiao’s injuries, the policemen and the manager waited in the hall.

The doctor asked Tang Xiaoxiao why she didn’t go to the hospital after she was injured.

Tang Xiaoxiao replied that Gu Ning had helped her a lot and that she was much better now.

The policewomen and the doctor were surprised when they saw Tang Xiaoxiao’s injuries. Those burns had healed a lot.

The doctor used to think that Tang Xiaoxiao would need a skin transplant after watching the video on the Internet, but now, even though Tang Xiaoxiao’s injuries still looked a little scary, they were healing fast.

The policewomen and the doctor got curious. They asked Tang Xiaoxiao how Gu Ning had treated her wounds. Tang Xiaoxiao told them that Gu Ning had applied a medicine to her wounds, but she didn’t know what it was.

Since Tang Xiaoxiao didn’t know, the policewomen and the doctor didn’t ask further. They knew that Gu Ning wasn’t simple at all.

...

Although the final result wasn’t out yet, Tang Xiaoxiao’s name was cleared, so the crew of Palace invited her to join them.

Lin Lu, however, turned them down.

The crew of Palace had sided with Fan Sixuan before, so it was impossible for Tang Xiaoxiao to cooperate with them again. Therefore, Lin Lu demanded to end their agreement.

The crew of Palace also knew that they had made a wrong decision, so they accepted it.

Although it was Tang Xiaoxiao’s party who proposed to end the agreement, it was the fault of the crew of Palace after all, so Tang Xiaoxiao didn’t need to pay the liquidated damages.

The whole event happened and ended so fast in onlookers’ eyes. The scandal was exposed the previous afternoon, and the news reversal came out this noon, while the problem was solved this evening.

It was the first public crisis in history which had been overcome within such a short amount of time!

Actually, people weren’t very surprised by the result, because Gu Ning was also involved in it. In many people’s eyes, there was nothing that Gu Ning couldn’t do.

...

It was already 8 pm when the mess was cleared.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting dined at the Tang family’s house before they left together later.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya went to deal with their own things, while Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to have a walk.

They only had one car, so Gu Ning told Gao Yi to drive them to the Fengshang Shopping Mall. Leng Shaoting would arrange for someone to send his car there.

Gu Ning planned to buy some clothes for Leng Shaoting.

She had bought Leng Shaoting clothes last winter, but now they were in a different season. And Gu Ning enjoyed shopping for clothes for her boyfriend.

Leng Shaoting was a patient boyfriend, so he was also willing to shop with Gu Ning.

There weren’t many men who were willing to shop with their girlfriends.

Leng Shaoting felt happy when Gu Ning proposed to buy new clothing for him. He didn’t lack clothes, but he wouldn’t reject Gu Ning’s kindness.

When the beautiful Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting showed up, they attracted a lot of attention from people around them.

“Wow, I wish I had such a handsome boyfriend!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Me too!”

“I bet he’s also very rich.”

“Well, I guess you must be a rich and beautiful girl first if you want to have such an outstanding boyfriend.”

“Don’t you think the girl looks familiar?”

“Have you met her somewhere before?”

“Probably.”

The girl couldn’t remember Gu Ning’s name, so she didn’t think further. However, after Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were already far away, she suddenly realized that Gu Ning was the famous Goddess Gu! She got excited at once.

Unfortunately, Gu Ning was already gone.

If she could have taken some pictures with Gu Ning, her friends would be super envious of her.

...

“I think some people will believe that you’re a lover kept by me again if they see me buying expensive clothes for you,” Gu Ning joked.

“Ha-ha, I’m willing to be your lover,” Leng Shaoting said with a smile.

Gu Ning was amused.

After that, they walked into a famous shop for male clothing.
