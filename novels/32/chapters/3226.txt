3228 Why Didn’t You Tell Me?

Cao Xinya didn’t argue with Jiang Yunyun because their fathers were business partners. It wouldn’t do her family any good if she had a bad relationship with Jiang Yunyun.

“Xinya…” Jiang Yunyun felt aggrieved, but still agreed. “Fine!”

Jiang Yunyun felt that Cao Xinya still trusted her, but was slightly mad at her after being embarrassed and so asked her not to interfere again. If that was the case, then Jiang Yunyun was still satisfied.

She didn’t think a strange woman could so easily damage her relationship with Cao Xinya.

Before long, it was Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen’s turn to race.

Because racers were mainly men, everyone was surprised to see a young girl. At the same time, they took her lightly.

In most men’s eyes, women didn’t have any skills. Besides, a female driver had a negative connotation nowadays.

“Does she think it’s a kids’ game to race cars? How dare she do this? And she even chose the third track.”

“Why would she risk her life just for a SVIP card?”

“Right, she’s so beautiful. I don’t want her to have an accident.”

“…”

Cao Xinya and her friends also saw Leng Xiaoyao, but none of them believed that Leng Xiaoyao could win. Especially Jiang Yunyun who was embarrassed by Leng Xiaoyao publicly, she even cursed Leng Xiaoyao and hoped that Leng Xiaoyao would have an accident.

Leng Xiaoyao, however, didn’t care.

“Brother Mochen, remember to do your best. It’s not easy to meet a strong competitor like you. If you don’t, I won’t talk to you again,” Leng Xiaoyao said seriously. If Li Mochen didn’t do his best, it would be boring.

“Sure.” Li Mochen answered. Even if he wanted Leng Xiaoyao to win, he wouldn’t let her know.

He didn’t care about the result. Leng Xiaoyao’s safety was more important in his eyes.

As long as Leng Xiaoyao was safe, he would do his best in the game.

Afterwards, they got into their cars. As soon as the race started, they set off at the same time.

No one thought that Leng Xiaoyao could win, but they soon realized that they were wrong because Leng Xiaoyao drove extremely fast and steadily. Her car was nearly touching Li Mochen’s.

“Jesus, I might have taken this woman lightly. It turns out she is a master!”

“I was so wrong.”

“…”

Someone argued. “Shut up if you know nothing about car racing. You just look stupid.”

“You…” Jiang Yunyun was mad, but couldn’t say anything because she indeed knew nothing about car racing.

People who knew car racing could see that Leng Xiaoyao really had skills.

Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao didn’t tell Si Yiqi that they came to the circuit, so Si Yiqi had no idea.

At this time, Si Yiqi and several of his friends were watching the race being projected in the VIP room. They didn’t see any skilled racers, so they felt bored. All of a sudden, they noticed two fast moving cars and immediately stood up in excitement.

These two racers were as skilled as Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen!

Si Yiqi didn’t expect the two racers to be Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen because he thought that they would tell him if they came.

Without delay, Si Yiqi called the registration counter to find out who these two racers were.

After finding out who they were, he was mad.

“Damn, why didn’t they tell me? Don’t they take me as a friend?” Si Yiqi swore when he finished the call. He was so angry.

“Yiqi, what’s wrong?” Si Yiqi’s friends asked him at once.

“These two racers on the track are my friends. I didn’t know that they came today!” Si Yiqi said angrily. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Are they the two people in the promotion video?” One man guessed.

“Yes, they are,” Si Yiqi said. Because he was angry, his voice was a little aggressive.

“Gee, we’re lucky to see them. Yiqi, can you introduce us to them later? We want to meet them,” one man said.

“Right!” The others chimed in.

“I’ll ask them later,” Si Yiqi said. He couldn’t make the decision for Li Mochen.

“Great.” The others agreed. They didn’t think it was wrong. After all, they wanted to see Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao, so they needed their agreement.

Both Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen were skilled, so the race was very exciting. At the bend, neither of them slowed down, but no accidents happened. They drove steadily along the track.

Everyone watched it with excitement and worry.

Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen overtook one another in turns. Either of them could be ahead. The audience even guessed whether they would arrive at the ending point together.

At the same time, many people guessed whether they were the two people in the promotional video.

“Why do I have a feeling that they might be the two people in the promotional video?”

“I believe so. Especially since when they went around the bend, they didn’t slow down at all and drove steadily. It’s the same as the video.”

“Oh my! If so, we’re really lucky to see them today.”

“That girl surprises me more.”

“I thought she couldn’t do it, but unexpectedly she’s a master.”

“…”

Jiang Yunyun was extremely displeased.

She thought that Leng Xiaoyao didn’t have any skills. However, to her astonishment, Leng Xiaoyao was an extremely skilled racer.

She cursed Leng Xiaoyao and wanted to see her have an accident, but nothing happened.

When the two racing cars came closer and closer to the finish line, they were still barely apart. No one could tell which one of them would arrive first.

“I think they should arrive at the same time.”

“I think one of them hasn’t done their best.”

“Even so, they’re impressive. Look at how little time they’ve used!”

Upon looking at the time, everyone was shocked, because Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen were too fast.

Without surprise, Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen arrived at the ending line at the same time, but they were several seconds faster than last time.

When they got out of the cars at the finish line, a large group of people surrounded them and asked whether they were the two people in the promotion video.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t bother to keep it a secret. She admitted it and got many people’s compliments.

Right at this moment, a male voice sounded in an acid tone. “It’s really funny. Why didn’t you tell me that you were coming? I didn’t know that it was you until I noticed two skilled racers and asked the registration counter about it.”

It was Si Yiqi.

He looked quite unhappy.

Because the crowd knew that Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen were the two people in the promotion video, they weren’t surprised that Si Yiqi seemed so familiar with them.
