Chapter 51: Head to City G

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning had believed the man had abandoned Gu Man, but the truth was totally different.

Ning, that was the reason why Gu Man named her daughter Gu Ning!

“When I was with him, I felt the happiness I’d never had. Thus, I thought of committing suicide after he had that accident. I knew it was selfish. It was unfair to my loving parents and my elder sister. When I was full of those tangled emotions, I found out that I’d been pregnant for three months. Therefore, I continued my life and dropped out of the school.”

What had happened next wasn’t a secret to Gu Ning.

Gu Man’s mother thought it was humiliating that Gu Man was pregnant before getting married. She had asked Gu Man to have an abortion, or she wouldn’t admit that Gu Man was her daughter.

Gu Man had chosen her child over her mother, thus she had left her home. She had then used money from her father to rent a house and try to find jobs.

But she had been refused because of her pregnancy.

After a few months, she had run out of money. Gu Man had to turn to Gu Qing for help afterwards.

After Gu Man and left her home, her father and Gu Qing had searched for her in vain. It had been Gu Man who had turned to Gu Qing on her own initiative.

Gu Man’s father then picked Gu Man up and took her back home. Under her father’s protection, Gu Man had successfully given birth to Gu Ning.

Eighteen years later, the old sadness was already gone, but Gu Man still felt unhappy every time she thought of those memories.

The next day, Gu Ning got up early as usual. She ran to school then continued to run with her friends. She didn’t go back to her school until it was five minutes before the morning class.

There weren’t bathrooms in their school, so they couldn’t take a bath even though they were all wet from that sweat.

Luckily, they would take a shower when they went back home and they weren’t smelly.

“Boss, today’s Friday. Let’s go have some fun in our club tonight!” Hao Ran said on the way back to their classrooms.

“I like it. Gu Ning, go with us!” Chu Peihan said with excitement.

“Yeah! It’s our place. It’s safe,” Qin Zixun said.

“We have a new kind of fruit drink. Girls love it! Boss, why not have a try?” Zhang Tianping added.

“I need to go to City G this afternoon, sorry,” Gu Ning replied.

The crowd immediately felt disappointed.

“Why are you going to City G?” Chu Peihan asked.

“To deal with something,” Gu Ning said.

“Something about what?” Hao Ran inquired.

“That’s a secret,” Gu Ning answered.

Hearing that, they all felt bored, but since Gu Ning wasn’t willing to tell, they stopped asking.

“But, I’ll buy gifts for you all,” Gu Ning added.

Knowing that, everyone was delighted again.

“Sounds great!”

Although they all knew Gu Ning was from a poor family, they didn’t reject her kindness because they believed Gu Ning wouldn’t buy something expensive.

Gifts showed affection and didn’t need to be expensive.

“If you’re not staying in the hospital these two days, should we go visit your mother?” Mu Ke asked with care.

“No, it’s fine. An Qian will be there,” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning absolutely wouldn’t allow them to visit her mother, because she had lied to Gu Man, saying that she was going to City G with Mu Ke. If they went to visit Gu Man, Gu Man would know the truth.

At noon, Gu Ning received a message from Qin Zheng. Qin Zheng invited her to have a talk. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Gu Ning didn’t think there was any need to talk with Qin Zheng. She had forgiven Qin Zheng about the car accident, and that was the best she could do.

If Qin Zheng stayed away from her afterwards, then everything would be fine. If he still came to bother her, she wouldn’t be kind to him.

Gu Ning directly blocked Qin Zheng’s number.

Qin Zheng didn’t get Gu Ning’s answer and was displeased. He stopped sending messages to Gu Ning because he was mad.

Recently, Qin Zheng always had Gu Ning in his mind. He couldn’t tell what his feelings for Gu Ning were now himself.

When he heard Gu Ning and her mother had been kicked out by her grandmother because of Gu Xiaoxiao, he wanted to help.

But Gu Ning ignored his message.

Gu Xiaoxiao stayed away from Gu Ning today.

She wanted to laugh at Gu Ning, but she was afraid that Gu Ning would beat her again.

Shao Feifei also kept a distance from Gu Ning today, except for her unkind looks.

Gu Ning had a peaceful day today. She had already prepared everything she needed, so she took a taxi, heading to the airport directly after the afternoon classes were over.

She had a backpack with her, and put all the documents inside her Jade Eyes. There was only a change of clothes in her backpack. She wanted to change when she arrived at the airport, because she couldn’t go to City G in her school uniform.

It was the rush hour, and the roads were crowded downtown. When the car left downtown, it moved fast again.

Gu Ning left her school at 5:50 pm and her plane would fly at 7:30. It took around 40 minutes to get to the airport. When Gu Ning arrived, it was already 6:40 pm.

50 minutes were left, so Gu Ning wasn’t in a hurry. She went to a washroom and changed her clothes.

Jean shorts, a loose white T-shirt and a pair of white sneakers. Gu Ning pulled up her hair, and looked energetic and attractive.

Plus her flawless skin and her beautiful face. She was literally charming and shining. People around her would give her glances once in a while.

Gu Ning didn’t have time to buy new clothes, so she was wearing her old clothing.

Luckily, Gu Man always treated Gu Ning well. Sometimes, Gu Man would buy some clothes of good quality to Gu Ning, like the outfit Gu Ning was wearing today. It wasn’t expensive, but cost around a hundred yuan.

Gu Ning stood in line to take her ticket, then she was in the lounge.

In the lounge, Gu Ning still had half an hour. It wasn’t enough time for a meal, so Gu Ning planned to have a cup of coffee.

Coincidentally, the minute Gu Ning walked in the café, she saw Qin Yifan with a young, beautiful lady.

“Gu Ning, what a coincidence! Where are you going?” Qin Yifan beamed when Gu Ning appeared in his sight. He stood up in excitement, greeting Gu Ning.

The lady beside Qin Yifan was a little unhappy. She checked Gu Ning out with an unkind look. She was jealous, especially when she found out Gu Ning had a charming appearance.

Gu Ning had an acute mind. She immediately felt the unkindness from the lady, but she ignored it.

“Hi. What a coincidence! I’m going to City G. How about you?” Gu Ning planned to have a good relationship with Qin Yifan, so she was friendly towards him.

Of course, Gu Ning had no intention to disguise it.

“Wow, I’m flying to City G too! My plane will be leaving at 7:30 pm, and you?” Knowing Gu Ning was heading to City G, Qin Yifan was even more excited now. Others might even believe he liked Gu Ning.
