Chapter 2361: It Takes Time

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I’m at the peak of the Heartbeat Stage.” Gu Ning was very honest, but she refused to tell them too many details. “Um, it’s because of my special physical condition that I can completely hide my breath as a cultivator. I don’t know how to explain it. I have great strength too, so I can fight with cultivators at the Golden Core Stage.”

Ma Shibiao and the other men didn’t understand what they were talking about. Anyway they would be punished according to the law after they were arrested, so they wouldn’t have any chances to say anything.

Jiang Liluo and Si Jin were surprised. Although they were also cultivators, they didn’t know everything. There were many strange things that were hard to explain anyway, so they didn’t doubt Gu Ning’s words.

They hadn’t seen such a thing before, but that didn’t mean it didn’t exist.

…

When they got out of the ancient grave, it was already 6 am, but because it was winter, the sky became bright late, so it wasn’t fully bright yet.

Once they were out, Jiang Liluo and Si Jin filled the hole made by the gravediggers.

Gu Ning’s phone could also receive signals, so she called Xin Bei right away.

Xin Bei and the others were still waiting in the living room. As soon as his phone rang, Xin Bei picked it up.

“Hi, Gu Ning, how is it?” Xin Bei asked in a hurry.

“I caught them. There are eight of us. Five are criminals. Two are my friends. Arrange for a car to pick us up. Tao Lin will guide you to find us. I’ll see you at the place where I parked my car,” said Gu Ning. She knew that Tao Lin was fine now, so it wasn’t a big deal to let him be the guide. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Liluo and Si Jin turned to look at Gu Ning. When they saw her talking to a small box, they were confused.

What was that? Why was Gu Ning talking to it?

“Sure, we’ll be right there,” said Xin Bei.

Without delay, Xin Bei and three other men drove three cars to their destination.

“Gu Ning, what’s that in your hand? Why were you talking to it just now?” Si Jin asked.

Gu Ning raised her hand and said, “This is called a smartphone. It can help you talk to people who are far away. You can also have a video talk. After the sky is totally bright, I’ll have a video call with my master. We can see his face on this phone at that time. My master is in the capital, which is over a thousand kilometers away. We can’t see him face to face right away, so I can only settle everything here before we go to meet him.”

“What? This thing can help you talk to people who are far away? We can also see Senior Shangguan in it?” Si Jin and Jiang Liluo were both shocked.

“Yes, I wasn’t talking to it, but to someone else through it,” said Gu Ning.

“Jesus, that’s unbelievable!”

Si Jin and Jiang Liluo were too shocked to believe it.

Ma Shibiao and the others, however, were scared. In fact, they were horrified the entire time.

What kind of people were they? How could they live for hundreds of years? Was it true?

Ma Shibiao and the others still couldn’t believe it was true, but they didn’t think they were acting when they had no idea what a smartphone was. Besides, there was no need for them to act!

They just witnessed that Nicholas took out a wooden stick and made black gas. Nicholas could even become invisible for a few seconds. Even if they refused to believe in ghosts, they had to face the reality that ghosts might really exist. However, although they believed it, they still couldn’t accept it.

“There are many unbelievable things in today’s society. You need more time to learn about them. If you can’t learn how to use them, you won’t be able to live properly. Well, given your abilities, I don’t think you’ll have no food, but you have a long future ahead. You still need to learn about them.”

“Can you teach us?” asked Si Jin. At the beginning, they didn’t think it was a big deal, because they had great survival skills, but there were indeed many new things in this world waiting for them to learn about.

They were already shocked by a smartphone, but there were many other inventions.

They had doubted Gu Ning’s words, but gradually they were convinced by her sincerity.

“Of course I can, but I don’t have much free time. I can’t teach you everything in person. I’ll arrange for someone to help you with it.” Gu Ning said, “I think you can live with my master for the time being. You just left the ancient grave and you don’t know anyone except for my master. He’ll introduce the current world to you.”

“Thanks,” said Si Jin and Jiang Liluo. Although they stood in awe of Shangguan Yang, Shangguan Yang was the only person they knew now. They would feel safe if they lived with Shangguan Yang.

“Are you Senior Shangguan’s only disciple?” asked Si Jin.

“No, there is another senior disciple. He’s also my fiancé. I’ll introduce him to you later,” said Gu Ning. She didn’t want to tell them Leng Shaoting’s name in front of Ma Shibiao and the other men.

…

It took them about half an hour to escort Nicholas and the other criminals back to where Gu Ning stopped her car.

There was still a distance away from the intersection, but they didn’t go to wait at the intersection since it was almost bright now. Xin Bei and the other men wouldn’t arrive until more than half an hour later, and they didn’t want other traffic to see them.

At 7 am, Xin Bei and the other men arrived.

When Jiang Liluo and Si Jin saw three large boxes moving around on the road, they asked curiously, “What’s that?”

“It’s a car. We move around in it now. It’s just like a horse or a carriage, but I don’t know how it’s made,” said Gu Ning.

“Oh!” Jiang Liluo and Si Jin nodded. Hearing Gu Ning’s explanation, they understood that cars were of the same use as carriages in their age. It was a way of transportation.

Xin Bei and the others saw them from a distance, and quickly drove to them.

Once Ma Shibiao saw Xin Bei, he realized who wanted to catch him.

Xin Bei and the others were amazed by Gu Ning’s efficiency, because she easily caught the criminals that they had been chasing for a long time.

Actually, if Leng Shaoting was present, they could easily have caught the criminals as well.
