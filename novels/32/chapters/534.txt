Chapter 535 Bai Xueyan Calls Gu Ning

Zhang Shunlin turned to Long Ge for help and gave him a hundred thousand yuan. As for the two million yuan Gu Qinyang would have to pay for the vase, they would share it fifty-fifty.

Because of Situ Ye’s order, members of the Qing Gang hadn’t moonlighted for a long time to make extra money, but Long Ge gave in to money and agreed this time. Unexpectedly, he made a wrong decision.

“Zhang Shunlin!” Gu Qinyang clenched his teeth in anger. It was obvious that he had known Zhang Shunlin for a long time.

Zhang Shunlin had chased Wen Yulan back when they had been in college. Once Wen Yulan had rejected him, he had spread rumors around that Wen Yulan only liked the rich and disdained the poor. Zhang Shunlin was merely a selfish man, who didn’t care about others’ feelings; he only cared about his own benefit. If he had been a charming gentleman, he could have attracted girls’ attention. Like Gu Qinyang, who wasn’t rich, but treat Wen Yulan very well.

Besides, Zhang Shunlin never paid much attention to his appearance, which was one of the reasons girls wanted to keep a distance from him.

This time, Gu Qinyang hated Zhang Shunlin the most. As for his so-called friends, he hated them too. To his astonishment, his “friends” would scheme against him just for money.

“Well, Long Ge, if you hear that anyone else is going to hurt my uncle, please give my uncle a helping hand if you don’t mind,” Gu Ning said politely.

“Of course. Of course,” Long Ge said. If he had known that Gu Qinyang was Gu Ning’s uncle, he wouldn’t have trapped him. After figuring out the truth, Gu Ning didn’t say anything further, but left with Gu Qinyang.

However, Gu Ning had no intention to forgive Zhang Shunlin.

“Ningning, thank you so much! If it hadn’t been for you, I could have been beaten or killed!” Gu Qinyang was still frightened.

“Well, I should apologize to you instead. If I hadn’t criticized him in public, he probably wouldn’t have trapped you,” Gu Ning said and felt a little guilty. It wasn’t the first time that Wen Yulan had met Zhang Shunlin, but Zhang Shunlin normally would make fun of her and wouldn’t take actual actions to hurt Wen Yulan or Gu Qinyang. However, he had lost face in public last time when he had encountered Gu Ning in the shopping mall, so he would of course take revenge since he was so selfish.

“Ningning, it’s not your fault. Zhang Shunlin is a selfish backstabber!” Gu Qinyang didn’t blame Gu Ning, but hated Zhang Shunlin more than ever. He wasn’t a weak man, and there was a long-standing grudge between him and Zhang Shunlin, but he had to tolerate it because he didn’t have the ability to punish Zhang Shunlin.

“Uncle, how much do you know about Zhang Shunlin? Tell me about him,” Gu Ning said to Gu Qinyang

“Not very much. I only know that he does equipment wholesale business and has dozens of millions of yuan in wealth,” Gu Qinyang said.

Leng Shaoting understood what Gu Ning planned to do, so he said, “Let me handle it.”

“Great.” Gu Ning didn’t reject.

If Leng Shaoting was willing to help her, she wouldn’t mind, because she needed to give him some chances to prove his ability as her

man.

Gu Ning was so outstanding, and Leng Shaoting sometimes felt like he was useless. He thought that it was his duty to protect his girl. Therefore, Leng Shaoting was cheered up when Gu Ning agreed.

Hearing their talk, Gu Qinyang understood that they were going to punish Zhang Shunlin and felt excited. Zhang Shunlin deserved it.

After that, Gu Ning called Gu Man and told her that Gu Qinyang was fine.

Although Gu Ning said that Gu Qinyang was fine, Gu Man, Gu Qing and Wen Yulan were still worried about his safety before they saw him in person.

Gu Qingshi and Gu Yinyin, on the other hand, had no idea what their father had just been through and kept playing on their tablets.

When Gu Ning and them got back, Wen Yulan was finally relieved after seeing that Gu Qinyang was fine.

“What happened? How did you break the Qing Gang’s antique vase?” Wen Yulan asked Gu Qinyang.

Gu Qinyang then told Wen Yulan everything.

Hearing that it was Zhang Shunlin’s scheme, Wen Yulan was furious at once. Zhang Shunlin had made fun of her, and he even wanted to trap them this time. Two million yuan was a fortune for them, and it was impossible for them to pay it.

Luckily, Gu Ning helped them, otherwise, their family would be ruined.

“What a backstabber Zhang Shunlin is! I really want to beat him!” Wen Yulan said in anger.

“Don’t worry. Ningning will handle it,” Gu Qinyang said.

Hearing that, Wen Yulan relaxed slightly.

Since Gu Qinyang was safely home, they dropped the topic, and enjoyed dinner.

After the meal, Gu Ning received Bai Xueyan’s call.

Once Gu Ning answered the call, Bai Xueyan criticized Gu Ning on the phone, “Gu Ning! Why didn’t you tell me that you’re in City G now?”

Gu Ning immediately explained, “I came here along with my mom and aunt just for a short trip, so I didn’t tell anyone.”

“Well, you could have told me,” Bai Xueyan insisted.

“Um...” Gu Ning didn’t know what to say. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“What? Aren’t we friends?” Bai Xueyan questioned.

Gu Ning thought that it was hard to explain it to Bai Xueyan, so she remained silent.

“What? Aren’t we?” Bai Xueyan asked again.

“Yes, of course!” Gu Ning said resignedly.

“What are you doing now?” Bai Xueyan asked.

“I’m in my uncle’s place,” Gu Ning said.

“Why don’t you come out and meet me? I’m in Allan’s café,” Bai Xueyan said.

From Bai Xueyan’s tone, Gu Ning understood that she was in a bad mood.
