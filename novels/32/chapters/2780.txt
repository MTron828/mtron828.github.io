Chapter 2781: Zhan Zhiyin’s Threat

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Cared for by Leng Shaoming, Zhan Zhiyin was very touched. She loved Leng Shaoming, so she was willing to help him. After all, it was not very dangerous for her.

“I’m not an ordinary girl. I’ll be safe,” said Zhan Zhiyin, trying to persuade Leng Shaoming.

“No, you can’t do it.” Leng Shaoming frowned worriedly. He believed Zhan Zhiyin, but he cared about her too much.

“If you won’t allow me to do it, I’ll just do it secretly. Do you think you can stop me? You better tell me everything about them. Otherwise I could be in serious danger.” Zhan Zhiyin threatened. She was determined to carry out her plan.

She was so honest with Leng Shaoming, because she knew it was impossible for him to stop her. He had his work to do so he couldn’t stay with her all the time.

“You…” Leng Shaoming felt amused yet annoyed. Anyway, since Zhan Zhiyin had already made up her mind, he had to give in. “Fine, you win.”

If he didn’t give in, she might really end up in trouble without any help.

Although Leng Shaoming could stop her by threatening her as well, he wouldn’t. There was no need for him to do that.

If he threatened Zhan Zhiyin, she might be hurt.

“I knew it!” Zhan Zhiyin said proudly. Leng Shaoming gave in to her threat today, but she was reasonable. She knew how to carry out her plan.

Leng Shaoming put on a resigned look.

“No need to rush right now. I need some time to collect their information,” said Leng Shaoming. He didn’t know much about the director’s son yet. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Sure,” said Zhan Zhiyin.

After Zhan Zhiyin became Leng Shaoming’s girlfriend, she shared the good news with her grandfather.

They just got together and their romantic relationship wasn’t stable yet. It was hard to say whether they would marry one day since it was still a little early.

Nevertheless, Zhan Zhiyin believed that Leng Shaoming was her Mr. Right, so she wanted to marry him.

She wouldn’t give up unless he lost interest in her, betrayed her, or asked her to go away. Anyway, she wouldn’t think about that right now.

That didn’t happen yet and she believed Leng Shaoming would be a loyal boyfriend.

Even though Leng Shaoming wasn’t sure whether they would marry one day, he definitely took their relationship seriously, so he agreed to share the good news with their families right after they were together.

Actually, both of their families hoped they could be together.

When Zhan Daosong heard the good news, he was happy for Zhan Zhiyin and Leng Shaoming. He was very satisfied with Leng Shaoming and most importantly Zhan Zhiyin loved him.

As long as Zhan Zhiyin loved him, it was the best news he could ever hear.

However, after the whole Zhan family heard the news, a drama happened.

Zhan Zhiyin’s parents and older brother had a very good impression of Leng Shaoming, because he and his family were outstanding.

The Zhan family was rich too, but was hardly comparable to the Leng family. Nevertheless, it was still a properly matched marriage if Zhan Zhiyin married Leng Shaoming one day.

After all, they were both from high society even though their families weren’t equally rich.

The drama happened because of Zhan Zhiyin’s third aunt.

Mrs. Zhan was always setting Zhan Zhiyin up with her nephew. Anyway, her natal family was rich too, or she wouldn’t have been able to marry into the Zhan family.

The Zhan family didn’t care much about one’s status, but only people in the same circle could get to know each other. Therefore, if Mrs. Zhan wasn’t born in a rich family, she wouldn’t have been able to meet Mr. Zhan.

Mrs. Zhan’s natal family was a normal rich family in City H. There was a huge gap between her natal family and the Zhan family, but the Zhan family didn’t care about that. If Zhan Zhiyin liked Mrs. Zhan’s nephew, they would be supportive, but Zhan Zhiyin disliked the man.

In fact, Mrs. Zhan’s nephew didn’t leave a good impression on the other members of the Zhan family, but they said nothing about it in front of Mrs. Zhan.

Mrs. Zhan’s nephew was handsome and looked nice on the surface. He had a good job and seemed to be a good man, but Zhan Zhiyin’s older brother knew he had abandoned his pregnant ex-girlfriend and even slept with his ex-girlfriend’s good friend. Zhan Zhiyin’s older brother had a really bad impression of this man and thought what the man had done was really disgusting.

At the beginning, Zhan Zhiyin’s parents felt he might be a good choice and talked about him with her, but they gave it up after hearing what he had done. They also greatly disdained Mrs. Zhan’s nephew.

However, once Mrs. Zhan heard that Zhan Zhiyin was Leng Shaoming’s girlfriend, she was mad. “What? Zhiyin is Leng Shaoming’s girlfriend now? Why? My nephew, Zihao, is also an outstanding young man. He’s so familiar to us. Isn’t he a better choice than Leng Shaoming? Why do you allow Zhiyin to be together with another man?”

Hearing that, many members of the Zhan family were displeased. Zhan Zhiyin’s mother couldn’t stand it anymore and directly argued. “How could you say that? It’s my daughter’s freedom to choose whoever she wants to be with. It’s a different society now. She doesn’t need to obey our orders. Even if she needs our advice, we’re very satisfied with Leng Shaoming. Leng Shaoming is a handsome young man with a good job and a top family background. It’s our luck that we can have an alliance with the Leng family. Zihao is also a good man, but to be frank, he’s hardly comparable to Leng Shaoming.”

“Ridiculous. Although Zihao isn’t comparable to Leng Shaoming, he’s one of our relatives. Why do you care so much about status? Do you disdain him just because Zihao isn’t as rich as Leng Shaoming?” Mrs. Zhan argued angrily.

“To be clear, it’s your relative, not ours. And don’t judge us just because we didn’t choose him. We just want Zhiyin to be with someone she loves. We don’t care about one’s family background. Your nephew is good to you, but not good to us. Don’t think we know nothing about him. We just didn’t want to embarrass you, so we said nothing. But we’re aware of his amoral deeds,” said Zhan Zhiyin’s mother.
