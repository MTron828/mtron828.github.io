900 Leng Shaoting Meets Xu Jinlin

“Alright, go have a warm shower. Don’t catch a cold,” He Yishao said.

He Yishao was a grown-up man, so he wouldn’t show his emotions on his face like He Siyin, but he cared no less than He Siyin did about He Siyang.

“Bye-bye,” He Siyang said, then walked to the bathroom, but he stopped after a few steps. “Um, Gu Ning, I need to take a shower and change my clothes now,” he said to Gu Ning.

“Great, bye,” Gu Ning said, and He Siyang left.

He Siyang’s behavior displeased Leng Shaoting again.

He Yishao and He Siyin also exchanged a glance with each other. He Siyang treated Gu Ning differently. However, no matter what He Siyang thought of Gu Ning, Gu Ning already had a boyfriend now.

Even though they didn’t know much about Leng Shaoting, they understood that he must be very outstanding given Gu Ning’s unusual ability.

Since the He family planned to maintain a good relationship with Gu Ning, they better not annoy her.

“How will you deal with them? There are 10 of them in all. Three are kept in the underground room of the ancient house; four are tied to trees; here are two, and we haven’t caught the last one yet,” Gu Ning said.

Looking at He Hongyuan’s people, both He Yishao and He Siyin were mad. He Yishao said, “They’re unkind people, but Siyang is safe and sound now, so we can’t kill them. We can let Siyang vent his anger after he puts on clean clothes, and we can throw their phones into the sea before we leave them on this island.”

It was the He family’s family affair after all, so Gu Ning agreed with them.

Afterwards, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to have a rest on the yacht.

“I’m going to City M tomorrow, and I’ll stay there for two days or so. Will you go there with me?” Gu Ning asked Leng Shaoting.

“I’m not sure yet. If I’m not assigned any tasks, I can go with you,” Leng Shaoting said. Once there was an important task, he had to go to fulfill it without hesitation.

Around an hour later, they went back to HK.

...

Today was also the opening day of Kamei Beauty Salon in City B, which caused a sensation.

Existing customers showed up first, along with several new customers. And many of them called their friends once they found out that the brand of skincare products used was Kouzi.

More and more women became Kouzi’s loyal fans after trying it on their faces.

Within a short time, the large store was filled with people.

Not every one of them would buy a whole set of Kouzi, but more than two thirds of them did, which were very good sales.

The store was always crowded during the morning, and none of the staff members had a break until noon. Luckily, they had eaten more at breakfast, so they weren’t hungry.

Manager Ding sent Gu Ning many pictures which showed the popularity of the store when she was free.

Seeing those pictures, Gu Ning beamed with satisfaction.

“Why are you beaming?” He Siyin asked with curiosity.

Gu Ning looked at He Siyin, and an idea dawned on her. “What skincare brands do you use normally?”

“Chanel, Dior, and so forth, but my skin doesn’t get much better,” He Siyin said. She wasn’t satisfied with her skin condition. Once she put on some make-up, it would soon be oily. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“I strongly recommend a new brand to you. Although it’s new, it’s going to be an international brand,” Gu Ning said, promoting her own brand.

“Really? What is it? As long as it’s effective, I don’t care whether it’s famous or not,” He Siyin said, and her eyes lit up. She trusted Gu Ning.

“It’s called Kouzi, and you can search it on the Internet,” Gu Ning said.

“Great!” He Siyin took out her phone at once.

After reading many comments about Kouzi on the Internet, He Siyin had a good impression of it.

Countless people said that Kouzi had saved their skin. In addition, the whole set of Kouzi skincare products was effective and functional.

Many loyal fans of Kouzi also posted their before and after photos of their skins, which were quite persuasive.

“Is it really so effective?” He Siyin couldn’t believe it.

“I have some of it with me right now, so you can try its facial masks,” Gu Ning said.

“Great, thanks!” He Siyin was excited. She would know its effect after trying it in person.

...

When they were back in HK, it was already 6 pm. He Yishao had told his people to prepare a meal for them, but he and He Siyang had to leave to deal with something else first.

In order to show their politeness and sincerity, He Siyin stayed.

Gu Ning didn’t care about it, but it was impolite if she left right away.

A group of them waited together for the elevator to come, but the man who walked out of it was surprised when the door of the elevator opened. He didn’t expect to meet Leng Shaoting here.

The man was precisely Xu Jinlin.
