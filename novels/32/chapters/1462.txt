When everyone was present, the dinner began.

Jiang Shuyuan stayed in the hospital to take care of Leng Shaojia, so she was absent.

Actually, in order to take care of Leng Shaojia, Jiang Shuyuan had to commute between the hospital and her workplace every day. She had a job and couldn’t leave it behind for too long. Jiang Shuyuan also brought several changes with her in case she needed to stay in the hospital overnight.

Leng Shaojia was a girl after all, so it was inconvenient for Leng Yuanqian to take care of her.

Leng Yuanqian would go see her once he was free, so would Master Leng. Master Leng still cared about Leng Shaojia because she was his granddaughter, but there was nothing he could do in the hospital.

...

While Gu Ning was enjoying dinner in the Leng family’s old house, the headquarters of the Shengning Organization was almost empty.

“What’s going on here? Does she know that we’re following her?” Wu Shunhua said.

“I don’t think so. Maybe she hid in another car and left already,” Dongfang Ziyu said.

Wu Shunhua nodded and asked, “What should we do now?”

“Go back to our place, then figure out whether Gu Ning’s company is in the building. We can continue to spy on her tomorrow,” Dongfang Ziyu said. Although they came from the cultivation world, they had connections in the mortals’ world as well, so it wasn’t difficult for them to find out about someone’s background. In addition, Gu Ning was quite famous now, especially on social media.

...

In the Leng family’s old house, Leng Shaoting brought Gu Ning upstairs after finishing dinner. His parents’ room was on the second floor, and was the first room on the right too and was under Leng Shaoting’s room.

The layout of the second floor was basically the same as that of the third floor.

Leng Shaoting’s parents’ room was also very large.

The refurbishment of the Leng family’s old house happened when Leng Shaoting’s parents were still alive about a dozen years ago, so their room stayed the same as in the past.

Everything in Leng Shaoting’s parents’ room was covered by white cloth to protect it from dust.

Because no one lived here, the room would only be cleaned twice a year. The first time was on the anniversary of their death, while the second time was at the New Year festival. The interval was nearly half a year.

Leng Shaoting looked sad once he walked near to his parents’ room. Gu Ning understood his feelings, but it was unavoidable. Luckily, it was an old story, and Leng Shaoting already grew up.

Since they needed to search around in the room, they needed to remove the white cloth.

“Oh, do you have a photo of your mother?” Gu Ning suddenly asked. There were cameras about a dozen years ago, but they used photographic film back then.

“Sure.” Leng Shaoting nodded.

After that, he went to take out an album with many photos of his family inside.

Gu Ning flipped it at once and saw a family photo of Leng Shaoting and his parents on the first page.

She was stunned the second she saw Leng Shaoting’s mother, because his mother was very gorgeous.

However, it made sense because Leng Shaoting was extraordinarily handsome, so his parents couldn’t be ordinary. Leng Shaoting resembled his father, but he looked more attractive. In addition, when he was a little kid, he was super cute and Gu Ning immediately adored him.

She kept on flipping through the album, which was mostly full of family photos of the three of them. They beamed with happiness in the photos, but Gu Ning somehow felt sad for Leng Shaoting. He used to have a happy family and loving parents by his sides, but he lost them along with his smile in an accident.

“Shaoting, what’s your mother’s name?” Gu Ning asked.

Leng Shaoting hesitated for a second, then said, “Yunyao.”

Gu Ning nodded, then put the album down and began to search around the room. There was no need for her to search with her hands, because she had a pair of Jade Eyes.

Within minutes, she found two old books transcribed by hand instead of printed by machine in the bookcase.

Both of the books were about cultivation, and Gu Ning didn’t think it was a coincidence. Without delay, she pulled them out from the shelves.

Leng Shaoting noticed and walked towards her.

“Wow.” He was greatly surprised when he saw the names of the two books. To his astonishment, there were books about cultivation in his parents’ room. He took over one of them and started to read it.

“Well, I think this is my mother’s handwriting.”

Although Leng Shaoting’s mother passed away when he was very young, he had a good memory and his mother’s handwriting was impressive.

An idea dawned on Gu Ning. “Did you mother leave anything else with her handwriting on it? If these two books were transcribed by your mother, I’m very sure that your mother was a cultivator.”

“I think I can find some.” Leng Shaoting immediately went to search for Yunyao’s notebooks with the help of his memories.
