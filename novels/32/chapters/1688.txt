Chapter 1689: Slowly Get Memories back

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Oh, does Shaoting know that you’re still alive?” asked Master Leng.

“Not yet, because I planned to meet you after getting my memories back. It sounds so unreal without my previous memories,” said Jing Yunyao.

“Well.” Master Leng sighed, “Shaoting became cold and introverted after he lost his parents. He seldom talked with other people, and his life was occupied by study. After that, he joined the army and has been busy training and doing his task afterwards.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Hearing that, Jing Yunyao’s heart ached for her son and tears came out of her eyes. She knew it was hard for a kid to live a good life without parents. Even though he hadn’t been treated badly, the death of his parents still had a great impact on him, which could affect his personality.

Although Leng Shaoting lived an affluent life now, Jing Yunyao still felt sad when she thought about what he had been through.

Master Leng continued, “Because of his hard work, he has made great achievements and became a major general at an early age. In fact, his achievements are enough for the title of a general, but he’s too young and we tried to make it look fair.”

Jing Yunyao felt proud of it too, but she was more sad than proud, because Leng Shaoting had risked his life for the honor.

“Because of Shaoting’s personality, I was worried that he might live his life alone! Luckily, he changed a lot once he met Ningning. Although he still looks cold most of the time, his heart is warm now,” said Master Leng, and he was really grateful to Gu Ning for that.

Jing Yunyao also felt touched. Gu Ning had helped her a lot and now she was able to meet the Leng family.

“If it’s possible, I hope that you can see Shaoting earlier and join us again. We can help you get your memories back slowly,” said Master Leng.

He was aging, and cared more and more about familial relationships. He really hoped that all the members of his family could gather together one day. And since Yunyao was the daughter-in-law of the Leng family, he really hoped that she could join them again.

“Sure.” Jing Yunyao nodded. Actually, after having spoken with Jing Jining, she already made up her mind to see Leng Shaoting one of these days, and now she had no worry at all.

Right at this moment, Gu Ning’s phone rang. Without giving a glance at the caller, Gu Ning knew that it had to be Leng Shaoting.

She was right.

“Grandpa, it’s Shaoting. Should we tell him right now or wait till he’s back?” asked Gu Ning. It was the Leng family’s personal affair after all, so she needed to ask for Master Leng’s opinion.

“Not now. It’s very late, and he’ll rush back home once he finds out. It’ll be dangerous if he drives fast,” said Master Leng. Although he wanted to have Leng Shaoting meet Yunyao as soon as possible, he cared more about his safety. “Ask him when he can be back. If he isn’t busy tomorrow, tell him to come home.”

“Sure, I’ll go outside to answer his call,” said Gu Ning. After Master Leng nodded, Gu Ning went outside. They were boyfriend and girlfriend after all, and they would talk sweet-nothings on the phone, so it was better if she answered the call away from the senior family members.

Once Gu Ning walked to the yard, she called Leng Shaoting back. Because it cost her some time to talk with Master Leng, Leng Shaoting already ended his call.

Leng Shaoting immediately picked up her call because his phone was right in his hand.

Gu Ning made up a lie and told him that she was in the washroom earlier.

Leng Shaoting wasn’t displeased. He only felt a little anxious today, so he was worried that Gu Ning might be in trouble. Now knowing that she was fine, he relaxed.

After chatting for a while, Gu Ning asked Leng Shaoting, “When can you come back?”

“Tomorrow morning. I’ll arrive in the capital before 11 am. Didn’t you say that your friends would come tomorrow? I’ll accompany you to treat them. Oh, I already arranged a car to pick them up at the airport, and we can go to see them together tomorrow,” said Leng Shaoting.

Even though they weren’t in the same age range and didn’t have many common topics, they were Gu Ning’s friends after all and they didn’t become her friends for business benefits. So he really wanted to know and socialize with Gu Ning’s friends.

Gu Ning, however, couldn’t believe that Leng Shaoting wanted to meet Chu Peihan and her other friends. With his presence, it was impossible for them to enjoy themselves.

Leng Shaoting had a natural air of power. Even though he had no intention to show them a cold expression, his social status was too high for them, so they would naturally stand in awe of him.

Anyway, since Leng Shaoting wanted to meet her friends, Gu Ning wouldn’t stop him. In addition, it might not happen, because Leng Shaoting would see Yunyao once he came back tomorrow. In that case, Leng Shaoting probably wouldn’t have time to meet Chu Peihan and Gu Ning’s other friends.

It was only a secret for Leng Shoating right now.

“Great, call me when you’re in the capital tomorrow,” said Gu Ning.

She didn’t have a long talk with Leng Shaoting on the phone, because she couldn’t keep Master Leng and the others waiting for her.

After the call, Gu Ning went back to the living room.

The moment she walked inside, she saw Leng Yuanqian. Gu Ning entered from the back yard, while Leng Yuanqian walked in from the front yard.

Leng Yuanqian was struck dumb for a second when he saw Gu Ning, because it was very late now, but she was still in the Leng family’s house.

“Hi, Uncle Yuanqian.” Gu Ning politely greeted him, but still kept a distance from him. Although she had grudges against Leng Shaojia and Jiang Shuyuan, she didn’t have any grudges against Leng Yuanqian, so she wouldn’t vent her anger on him.

It was obvious that Leng Yuanqian knew nothing about Jing Yunyao.

“Oh, hi!” Leng Yuanqian also greeted Gu Ning politely and stood away from her. He disliked Gu Ning and was unwilling to accept her, because he felt the crisis of Gu Ning supporting Leng Shaoting too. Nevertheless, he still needed to pretend to be polite on the surface. They didn’t have grudges against each other after all.

“Well, I need to see Grandpa Leng right now. Please excuse me,” said Gu Ning, then walked towards Master Leng’s study.

Seeing Gu Ning walking away, Leng Yuanqian squinted. He believed that Leng Shaoting must be here too since Gu Ning was here. He was very dissatisfied with it when Leng Shaoting always stayed in Master Leng’s study and had private conversations with him.
