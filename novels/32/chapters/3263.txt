3264 Miss Leng, I’m Sorry

Most importantly, Shen Xiyin rarely played stone-gambling. She didn’t need to cut raw jade materials by herself. Normally, she just directly engraved the jade.

The Leng family’s house was very large and there was a distance between the houses in the block. No one would be affected except for people living in the house. Even if she cut those raw jade materials at home, Leng Changyuan wouldn’t blame her.

As for Leng Yehua’s family, she didn’t care about their opinions!

Therefore, when she brought those raw jade materials back last time, she bought a stone-cutter as well. It made it convenient for her to work.

After all, there was jade in every raw jade material, so she didn’t want to give them to other people to do the job. If the news went abroad, it could cause trouble for the Leng family.

Enemies often crossed each other’s path. A short while later, Leng Xiaoyao saw Shi Yuran.

Although Leng Xiaoyao paid no attention to her, Shi Yuran had a different attitude. Shi Yuran still remembered what had happened at the Mo family’s party last time, and she didn’t give up the idea of teaching Leng Xiaoyao a lesson.

She had even paid people to do that, but she couldn’t find Leng Xiaoyao recently.

Therefore, when Shi Yuran saw Leng Xiaoyao, her expression was malicious, but she didn’t confront Leng Xiaoyao face to face.

Right after Shi Yuran seated herself nearby, she made a call.

Even though her voice was low and people near her couldn’t hear what she was talking about, Leng Xiaoyao could hear her conversation.

“Xiong, I found Leng Xiaoyao. She’s in XX restaurant,” Shi Yuran said.

Leng Xiaoyao was struck dumb for a second. Xiong? Who was that?

Leng Xiaoran believed that there was no grudge between her and the man called Xiong. Therefore, she wasn’t Xiong’s target, but Shi Yuran’s.

She was right.

“Great, I’ll take people there right now. Miss Shi, we won’t disappoint you,” said the man at the other side of the phone.

“Thanks, Xiong,” Shi Yuran said.

Leng Xiaoyao put on a resigned look. Did she really have bad luck? Why were there always people trying to cause trouble?

Nevertheless, she understood why Shi Yuran wanted to. Although Shi Yuran wanted to hurt her, she did it because she had embarrassed her publicly. It was understandable that Shi Yuran harbored a grudge against her.

However, even if it was understandable, Shi Yuran was digging her own grave. Leng Xiaoyao didn’t think that she was wrong.

It was impossible for Shi Yuran to hurt her!

When Leng Xiaoyao and Shen Xiyin left, it was half an hour later. Xiong was already waiting outside fifteen minutes after he received Shi Yuran’s call.

The moment Leng Xiaoyao and Shen Xiyin went into the parking lot, four men surrounded them.

Shen Xiyin was scared. Although Leng Xiaoyao was present and could protect her, she was still slightly worried because she didn’t know how strong these men were.

Once they showed up, they attacked Leng Xiaoyao. Without hesitation, Leng Xiaoyao fought back, quickly defeating them. The four men were shocked.

Looking at this scene from the window upstairs, Shi Yuran panicked. To her astonishment, Leng Xiaoyao was extremely skilled and defeated them within seconds.

This wasn’t the first time that Shi Yuran had paid Xiong to do things for her. He had completed the tasks very well before, so Shi Yuran thought that he had some ability. Unfortunately, he was quickly defeated by Leng Xiaoyao.

Shi Yuran couldn’t believe her eyes.

“Which one of you is Xiong? Why did Shi Yuran pay a bunch of useless people like you to attack me?” Leng Xiaoyao asked disdainfully.

Hearing that, they were struck dumb. It turned out that Leng Xiaoyao had heard of Xiong and knew that they were sent by Shi Yuran.

How did she know that?

None of them answered Leng Xiaoyao’s questions, so Leng Xiaoyao continued. “Which gang do you belong to? The Qiao Gang or a small gang?”

The four men shivered. They somehow felt that she had a relationship with the Qiao Gang. When she mentioned the Qiao Gang, she seemed very calm. She didn’t look scared at all.

“Tell me!” When they remained silent, Leng Xiaoyao became serious and put pressure on them.

The four men felt stressed. “The Qiao Gang.” One of them replied finally.

“You’re bold! How dare you pretend to be a member of the Qiao Gang and do bad deeds outside? I heard Ji Yanxi say that he doesn’t allow the members to take tasks in private. However, you dared to break the rules. If you are a member of the Qiao Gang, do you know Zhang Zengxu? He tried to hurt me last week, but was punished by Ji Yanxi in the end. I thought you would learn something from that, but it turns out that you don’t really listen to Ji Yanxi,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Hearing that, Xiong and his brothers were frightened.

They were indeed members of the Qiao Gang, so they had heard about Zhang Zengxu. Therefore, they behaved themselves recently and didn’t dare to take tasks in private.

However, Shi Yuran was a frequent client and had a high status. Since Shi Yuran’s target wasn’t as important as her, they decided to try it after considering it for a while. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Unexpectedly, this girl wasn’t ordinary. She had a relationship with their leader and caused Zhang Zengxu to be punished.

In that case, she must be very important. If they messed with her, their leader would be furious!

Thinking of that, Xiong and his brothers were covered in a cold sweat and trembled in fear. They realized that they made a terrible mistake this time.

Even though they had doubts, not many people knew about it. Most importantly, even if Leng Xiaoyao didn’t tell the truth, it was true that they were no match for her.

No matter what the situation was, they couldn’t go against Leng Xiaoyao any longer.

“Miss Leng, I’m sorry, we failed to recognize a formidable person. Please forgive us this time.” Xiong begged.

“Miss Leng, I’m sorry, please forgive us!” The other men chimed in at once.

“I can forgive you,” Leng Xiaoyao said. After that, she moved to Xiong and his brothers, then said in a low voice, “Whatever Shi Yuran wanted you to do to me, do the same to her. Anyway, you have the evidence of her crime, you shouldn’t be afraid of her.”

Although she wasn’t hurt, it didn’t mean that Shi Yuran didn’t commit the crime. Leng Xiaoyao decided to pay Shi Yuran back.

“Um…” Xiong hesitated, but he knew what he should do after thinking for a while.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t waste more time on them and left with Shen Xiyin.
