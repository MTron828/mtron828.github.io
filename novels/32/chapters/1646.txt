Chapter 1647: The Leng Family’s Old House Isn’t a Tiger Den

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

There were security guards standing at the gate of the Leng family’s old house, and they all knew Gu Ning, so they opened the gate once she came and there was no need to do a security check.

However, Jing Yunyao felt everything looked more and more familiar around her after she stepped into the spacious house. At the same time, she was also very nervous and couldn’t move a step forward.

Gu Ning comforted her. “It’s fine. Don’t be nervous. You’re wearing a mask, so no one will recognize you.”

Jing Yunyao nodded and followed her.

Master Leng was alone in the Leng family’s old house because Leng Yuanqian had gone to see Leng Shaojia while Leng Yuanzhen’s family went to the Yu family’s house.

Leng Changzhi walked out at this moment, and saw Gu Ning coming.

Without delay, he went to tell the good news to Master Leng, and Master Leng walked outside to welcome her at the door.

In front of Gu Ning, Master Leng was like an ordinary kind old grandpa, and he never thought that Gu Ning was inferior to him.

When Jing Yunyao saw Master Leng and Leng Changzhi, she felt nervous and stiffened again. She knew that they knew each other, but she just couldn’t remember who they were. It wasn’t a pleasant feeling.

“Hi, Grandpa Leng, Uncle Leng!” Gu Ning smiled at Master Leng and Leng Changzhi.

“Ningning, welcome home,” said Master Leng with a broad smile.

“Nice to see you, Lady Ning,” said Leng Changzhi.

In fact, Gu Ning still felt a little uneasy when Leng Changzhi called her in that way, but she accepted it in case Master Leng became unhappy. She was going to marry Leng Shaoting anyway.

Jing Yunyao, on the other hand, hid behind Gu Ning’s back. Gu Ning knew that she was nervous, but since she was already here, she couldn’t hide all the time.

“Grandpa Leng, I came with a friend today, but she’s amazed by the Leng family’s high social status and doesn’t dare come out,” said Gu Ning.

“Why? The Leng family’s old house isn’t a tiger den,” said Master Leng.

Gu Ning then caught Jing Yunyao’s hand and said to her, “It’s fine. Trust me.”

Jing Yunyao took a long breath in and walked out from behind Gu Ning.

“This is Grandpa Leng.” Gu Ning introduced Master Leng to Jing Yunyao.

Jing Yunyao didn’t dare to meet Master Leng’s eyes, and lowered her head. “Honored to meet you, Master Leng.”

“Nice to meet you too.” Master Leng did his best to look kind and easy-going. He didn’t understand why the girl was wearing a mask. However, even though he didn’t know why, he didn’t ask any questions about it, because she was Gu Ning’s friend.

“Grandpa Leng, my friend has a wound on her face, so she’s wearing a mask now. Please don’t mind it.” Gu Ning explained at once.

Master Leng nodded. “It’s fine, I don’t mind it at all.” He understood that girls all cared about their appearances. “Come on in now!”

After that, they walked in together.

Jing Yunyao looked around when she walked ahead. She still felt like everything looked familiar, but couldn’t remember anything.

Gu Ning couldn’t go to Leng Yuanhan’s room right after she got there, so she casually chatted with Master Leng for a while.

“Grandpa Leng, are you alone at home?” asked Gu Ning.

“Yeah, Your Uncle Yuanqian went to the hospital, and your Uncle Yuanzhen along with Aunt Yin went back to the Yu family’s house today. Your Aunt Yin’s nephew was accepted by the Capital University, so they need to celebrate it, but his total score is over 100 points lower than yours,” said Master Leng. He didn’t bother to hide the pride on his face.

Gu Ning, however, felt a little embarrassed. Although the gap of over 100 points was big, very few high school students were able to be accepted by the Capital University. Besides, she won the top scorer position with the help of her Jade Eyes, which actually wasn’t fair.

After chatting for a few minutes, Master Leng said, “Don’t you want to get the books? You can go now.” Master Leng didn’t know whether Gu Ning was busy today, and didn’t want her to waste too much time.

“Great, I’ll go get the books first, and we can talk later,” said Gu Ning. In fact, she couldn’t wait for it.

“Grandpa Leng, do you mind if my friend goes upstairs with me?” asked Gu Ning.

“Of course not! You can go together,” said Master Leng.

After that, Gu Ning went upstairs with Jing Yunyao.

The layout of the Leng family’s old house stayed the same, so Jing Yunyao easily found the room where she had lived with Leng Yuanhan in the past.

Many parts of the Leng family’s old house attracted her to have a look. She didn’t know why, but couldn’t resist the attraction.

“Is it this room?” asked Jing Yunyao.

“Yes, let’s go inside,” said Gu Ning.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m
