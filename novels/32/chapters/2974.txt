2976 Leng Xiaoyao, Don’t Be So Arrogant!

Therefore, Li Mochen couldn’t help but turn around to glance at Leng Xiaoyao’s car, where he saw her pressing herself to the car window.

It was the unfamiliar face of a girl, so Li Mochen didn’t think further and withdrew his gaze.

When Li Mochen turned around, Leng Xiaoyao met his eyes. She had to admit that he had acute senses to notice her gaze through the car window.

It was true that Li Mochen was very outstanding.

At the age of twenty-five, he had chiseled features and was quite handsome, but his cold, profound eyes made people stand in awe of him.

“Sir, what’s wrong?” The man sitting in the front passenger’s seat noticed Li Mochen’s reaction.

“Nothing.” Li Mochen answered in a hoarse voice.

If so, the man on the front passenger’s seat said nothing further.

Because Leng Xiaoyao’s car was driving in the same direction as Li Mochen’s and she was behind, she focused on Li Mochen’s car, looking at the back of his head.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t do it on purpose, she was simply distracted.

Li Mochen could feel that the gaze was still there, so he thought that the girl must be paying special attention to him. He wondered why.

However, he did nothing.

When they reached the fork at the front, the two cars separated. Li Mochen felt that he might have thought too much about the look, because there seemed to be nothing wrong with that girl. Perhaps it was just a coincidence that her gaze fell on him.

Li Mochen was alert because he was in a dangerous situation. People in his circle were all good at acting, so he had to be careful even if someone looked innocent.

…

At the school.

Leng Xiaoyao got out of the car first and went inside before Leng Yuqi.

However, right when they reached the classroom building, a boy stopped them. Looking at Leng Xiaoyao, he said, “Leng Xiaoyao, I heard what you’ve done. You became good at fighting and studying all of a sudden, so I’m interested in you. Why don’t you become my girlfriend? I can accept the spots on your face, because you can cover them with make-up. Anyway, you have delicate features. I believe you would be a great beauty without those spots.”

His confession of love was a little strange and straightforward.

He heard that Leng Xiaoyao had suddenly become excellent at studying from her classmates. After all, it happened in their class, not outside, so not many people knew about it.

Hearing the boy’s confession of love, other students walked over. Although they were surprised, they didn’t think it was strange.

Actually, this boy wasn’t a good student and was no less notorious than Leng Xiaoyao. Therefore, everyone felt they might be a perfect couple.

However, he wasn’t bad at studying either. He was in the top 100 and studied in Class 1.

Moreover, he was born in an influential family, so the teachers turned a blind eye to his actions.

This boy was called Xing Yuanyang. He was tall, strong, and good-looking. He was famous for his basketball skills and was very popular among the girls in their school. Unfortunately, because he often fought with others, many girls had to keep their distance from him.

“Since you know I can be a great beauty without those spots, why do you think I’d be interested in you? I don’t think it’s difficult to remove the spots from my face. I just don’t have time right now. And, I don’t like boys who can’t defeat me. So, if you want me to be your girlfriend, try to defeat me,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Honestly, she had a good impression of Xing Yuanyang, but it had nothing to do with love. She just felt he wasn’t a bad guy.

He often fought with other people and had a quick temper, but he only fought with those who angered him. He wouldn’t hurt other people for no reason, which was the same as Leng Xiaoyao. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, she had no intention of having a boyfriend in this incarnation because she might return to her original life anytime.

Even if she wanted a boyfriend, she wouldn’t choose Xing Yuanyang who wasn’t useful. She preferred Li Mochen who was mature and outstanding.

Speaking of Li Mochen, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t know anything about his background. She only knew that he was a very important figure and was very successful.

However, in order to rescue her, he fell into his enemy’s trap and died in the end.

Upon thinking of that, Leng Xiaoyao was filled with guilt. She promised that she was going to help him get rid of his enemies this time.

In this incarnation, she wouldn’t be a weak woman. She was a cultivator and no mortal was comparable to her.

Hearing that Leng Xiaoyao asked him to defeat her first if he wanted to be her boyfriend, Xing Yuanyang was upset, because he didn’t think he could win.

Although he often fought, Leng Xiaoyao had beaten eight girls alone, and he couldn’t do that.

“Leng Xiaoyao, don’t be so arrogant. It’s your honor for Yuanyang to be interested in you. How dare you ask him to do anything?” A boy interrupted at this moment. He was Xing Yuanyang’s lackey.

“My honor? That’s ridiculous. I don’t care about him at all. If I punch you, would you think you deserve it?” Leng Xiaoyao coldly looked at the boy. She even moved a step towards him, which scared the boy back. Obviously, he didn’t want to be punched by Leng Xiaoyao.

“Ha-ha.” Seeing that, Leng Xiaoyao snorted with laughter, then said disdainfully, “Are you scared? If you’re a coward, shut your mouth.”

“You…” The boy was reluctant to accept that, but he was also afraid of Leng Xiaoyao, so he said nothing. He only glared at her.

Leng Xiaoyao ignored the boy, and turned to look at Xing Yuanyang. “Xing Yuanyang, what’s your decision?”
