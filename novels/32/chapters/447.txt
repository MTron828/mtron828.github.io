Chapter 448 A Crazy Woman And A Terrible Man?

Xin Bei didn’t want to waste time on her either, because there were coffee stains all over his clothing, and he had to change it right away. Xin Bei then flung Cao Wenxin’s hand away before turning around and walking away.

Cao Wenxin was furious, but she also knew that she was on opponent for the man, so she could only walk back to her seat in anger. “He must be a terrible man!”

“I think that it’s better if you mind your own business. See, you can’t beat the man this time!” Ai Xinyu said.

“I was helping the girl! Didn’t you see how horrible the man was?” Cao Wenxin retorted.

“That’s their problem, and it has nothing to do with you!” Ai Xinyu rolled her eyes at Cao Wenxin.

After visiting the office building, Gu Ning called Lu Zhan and spoke to him on the phone for a while.

It would take another three months to redecorate the whole office building and it should be aired for at least a month before people moved in, so she decided to rent a small studio for Lu Zhan now so that he could prepare for the TV show after the Lantern Festival.

Gu Ning was in urgent need of an able manager, but she hadn’t found a qualified person yet, so Leng Shaoting helped her hire two people. Gu Ning was, of course, happy to have his help and believed that the two people that he hired had to be outstanding. As for Lu Zhan’s studio, Gu Ning told Zhang Shunjie to deal with it.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t leave the office building of the Shengning Group until 5:30 pm. Once they had left, she called Cao Wenxin and asked where she was. At that moment, Cao Wenxin had already been back at the hotel for a

while.

The appointed meeting place was the Xu family’s hotel, Jinlin Hotel, which wasn’t far from the hotel Cao Wenxin was staying at, so Gu Ning told her to take a taxi to Jinlin Hotel. It took Gu Ning around half an hour to leave for Jinlin Hotel too. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After Gu Ning told Cao Wenxin the number of the private room where they would gather together, Cao Wenxin set off for the hotel.

Meanwhile, Xu Jinchen and the other arrived one after another.

Xu Jinchen and his younger sister arrived first, followed by Chen Meng and Si Ming.

Seeing Si Ming, Xu Qinyin teased, “Oh, why is Yuxin absent?”

When she asked him that Si Ming’s expression was sad and he didn’t answer her question, but his face said everything. He was already disappointed that Qiu Yuxin couldn’t come to the capital. Xu Qinyin knew that, and deliberately teased him. What was worse, their relationship wasn’t clear yet, which bothered Si Ming the most.

“You’re not single either. I feel so lonely now,” Xu Jinchen said.

“He’s still single right now!” Chen Meng laughed.

Si Ming felt hurt. “Please stop! If I die of sadness you’ll lose a close bro!”

“We don’t mind,” Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng said with one accord.

“How could you...” Si Ming covered his chest with one hand. However, before he finished his sentence, the door was opened loudly. Everyone in the private room was surprised, and looked around. Xin Bei walked inside in anger, which was rare to see.

Xu Jinchen asked, “Xin Bei, what’s wrong? Why are you so mad?”

Xin Bei sat in front of the table, and drank a cup of tea before he opened his mouth. “I met Yu Wenjing today. She wouldn’t let me go and claimed that she has done so much for me and that I abandoned her. The woman is really shameless!”

Hearing that, everyone showed strong dislikes towards Yu Wenjing.

“Gee, Yu Wenjing is completely shameless! It was her who despised you because you had nothing before, and now that you’re successful, she wants you to be back at her side? Interesting!” Si Ming said.

“Exactly! Her vanity is so disgusting!” Xu Jinchen said with disdain.

“And, there was a crazy woman who suddenly appeared and threw a cup of coffee in my face! She even shouted that I’m a terrible man!” Xin Bei was furious. “Am I a terrible man? Am I?”

“Ha-ha, ha-ha!” Everyone laughed out loud. Although Xin Bei was the victim, it was so hilarious. They were close friends, and close friends enjoyed making fun of each other.

“However, what Yu Wenjing said is very likely to make others misunderstand you,” Chen Meng said.

Xu Qinyin echoed. “Exactly! Let alone the woman, I would think that you’re a terrible man too!”

“Even so, it had nothing to do with her!” Xin Bei complained. “She should mind her own business!”

“She was just being warm-hearted, but attacked the wrong person,” Xu Jinchen laughed again.

Although Xin Bei understood it too, he was still mad at that crazy woman.

Around 5:50 pm, Cao Wenxin arrived at the Jinlin Hotel, but she didn’t go to the private room, because she knew nobody there and felt a little shy to be there alone. Therefore, she decided to wait for Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting in the hall.

When it was almost 6 pm, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting arrived, and the three of them went upstairs together.

“Hi, Shaoting, Gu Ning!” They all greeted them.

It was the first time that Xin Bei had met Gu Ning. He was a little excited, because Gu Ning was the girl that changed his boss’s mind. “You’re Shaoting’s girlfriend, right?”

“Yes. Nice to meet you. I’m Gu Ning,” Gu Ning said politely.

“Hi, I’m...” Before Xin Bei could finish his sentence, Cao Wenxin noticed him and exclaimed, “You’re that terrible man!” Hearing that, everyone was struck dumb for a second. Seeing Cao Wenxin, Xin Bei was mad at once, and argued back. “And you’re the crazy woman! Listen, I’m not a terrible man!”

Except for Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting, the rest of the people instantly realized that the woman who came in with Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting was precisely the crazy woman that Xin Bei had told them about. However, this crazy woman came here with Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. What a drama!

“What’s going on here?” Gu Ning asked curiously.
