Chapter 180 The Post Is Deleted

For a teacher it was a shame to be doubted in that way. She also didn’t expect that Gu Ning would constantly argue against her. However, Gu Ning hadn’t finished yet, so she didn’t give Fang Qin a chance to retort. “As for the scandal this time, it’s totally ridiculous!”

“Is a girl amoral just because she gets out of a luxury car? Couldn’t the driver be her relative or a friend? Can’t the poor have a rich relative or friend? In addition, there is just a photo that doesn’t even show the driver. You don’t know whether the driver is male or female. How can you jump to the conclusion that I’m behaving immorally? Since you don’t the truth, why do you believe that it’s my fault? Aren’t you as a teacher supposed to know that it’s unwise to judge without solid proof?”

Fang Qin was in a rage caused by shame. She criticized Zhang Qiuhua this time, “Zhang Qiuhua, your student doesn’t have any sense of respect!”

“Am I wrong?” Gu Ning asked.

Gu Ning understood that she should respect her teachers, but the teacher should be respectable in the first place. Obviously, Fang Qin wasn’t a qualified teacher, so she didn’t deserve Gu Ning’s respect.

“I don’t think that Gu Ning is wrong. Professor Fang, we don’t know the truth yet. It’s not a good time to judge her now,” Jiang Yuan said. He wasn’t protecting Gu Ning, but being honest.

“You...” Fang Qin was more than mad now, but didn’t know how to argue with them. In fact, Fang Qin knew that it was still a rumor, but she was used to criticizing others just because she didn’t like them. Fang Qin lost her face, so she felt too embarrassed to stay in the office, and quickly left.

Without Fang Qin’s interruption, Zhang Qiuhua then had time to talk with Gu Ning. “Can you tell me the truth?”

“A friend who lives in the same area as me drove me to school. It’s nothing like what the post says. Please allow me to handle it myself?” Gu Ning replied.

“Are you sure you can deal with it?” Zhang Qiuhua asked. “Yes,” Gu Ning replied.

“Fine. I don’t want it to affect our class or our school, otherwise, you’ll be expelled, and I can do nothing about that,” Zhang Qiuhua reminded and warned Gu Ning.

The rumor wasn’t a big deal, but was influential. If it could be solved quickly, everything would be fine, but if it went abroad, someone would have to be punished.

“Sure,” Gu Ning answered. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The minute that Gu Ning left the office, her phone vibrated in her pocket. She took it out and had a look. It was a message from Leng Shaoting. She was shocked when she read it.

It was a video clip from his driving recorder. The person who had secretly taken the photo of Gu Ning was Chen Ziyao! Gu Ning would have thought that Chen Ziyao had learned a lesson from what had happened to Gu Xiaoxiao, but unexpectedly, she never learned to be kind.

Actually, Gu Ning previously had no intention to cause Chen Ziyao trouble, and forgave her for what she had done to her. However, since Chen Ziyao left the proof herself, Gu Ning would make full use of it.

Other than the video clip, in the message Leng Shaoting also asked her: May I help?

He didn’t want to interfere in Gu Ning’s personal affairs without her permission. Although he truly wanted to do something for her, he didn’t want to annoy her. Most importantly, he believed that Gu Ning had the ability to handle it herself.

Gu Ning was curious about how Leng Shaoting found out about the news, so she called him right away. The phone was answered within seconds; apparently Leng Shaoting was holding it in his hand.

“Ningning,” Leng Shaoting answered her. There was a faint trace of concern and guilt in his voice. Yes, he felt guilty, because if he hadn’t driven Gu Ning to school on his own initiative, if wouldn’t have happened.

It was the first time that Leng Shaoting had called Gu Ning’s name, Gu Ning’s heart lost a beat.

She asked, “How did you find out about it?”

“I was visiting your school forum out of boredom, so I found it,” Leng Shaoting answered.

He wanted to know more about Gu Ning’s school, so he had visited her school forum. To his astonishment, the rumor went viral. He had been greatly aggravated, but he didn’t know that Gu Ning was from a one-parent family until he had read the news. He now cared more about Gu Ning.

“Do you need me to do anything for you?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“No thanks. I’ll handle it,” Gu Ning declined.

“Great, if you need anything, just tell me.” Leng Shaoting was slightly disappointed that Gu Ning didn’t need his help, but he didn’t insist. He trusted Gu Ning. They hung up.

When Gu Ning got back to her classroom, the first class had already passed one third of its course. Seeing that Gu Ning was back, everyone wanted to find out what she had been through. Some was worried about her, while some were mainly waiting to see a drama. The teacher knew the reason why Gu Ning was late, so she didn’t say anything.

Gu Ning went back to her seat. She comforted Yu Mixi with a mild look. She used her phone, logging into the forum and editing her post. I’m Gu Ning from the fourth classroom in the 12th grade. As for the fake news saying that I climbed out of my sugar daddy’s luxury car, I’m mad and will never let the person who created the rumor get away with it. You have no proof that I can’t afford my tuition fee. No one should randomly judge a person based on unreal information. I’m poor now, but it doesn’t mean that I’ll be poor forever. And those who claim that you’re born rich; weren’t you fathers, grandfathers, or even grand grandfathers poor? No one earns their fortune without pain. No one knows what’s going to happen in the future. Let’s go and see!

Can’t the poor have a rich relative or friend? My friend drove me to school out of kindness. Is there anything wrong with that? If anyone of you have done amoral things, do you dare to show up in the public? Please delete the fake news right now and apologize to me, otherwise, you’ll pay for it!

Other than deleting the post and apologizing to Gu Ning, Chen Ziyao would still have to bear the result. Gu Ning would never let her get away with it that easily.

After editing it, Gu Ning sent it out.

Although it was the time for classes, the news was so hot that everyone focused on it. Therefore, the minute Gu Ning sent her post out, someone discovered it.
