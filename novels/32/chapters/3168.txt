3171 You’re too Noisy

“Em.” Leng Xiaoyao thought for a while. “How about specialties of City Yun?”

“No problem. Do you want Jiang Han and Mu Fan to bring them back, or must we go out?” asked Li Mochen. Because Leng Xiaoyao looked weak now, he wanted to ask for her opinion.

He understood that Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t so weak, drawing talismans for them just consumed her energy. Therefore, he should care about her.

“Let’s go out! I think it’s more interesting,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

After that, they went out together for night snacks.

They weren’t familiar with City Yun and didn’t know where they could find delicious food. Therefore, they asked the receptionist about it before leaving.

The receptionist recommended two places to them. One was farther, while the other was nearby.

The nearby place was full of activity, but was also slightly dangerous. People often fought and caused trouble there, so the receptionist recommended the farther place more.

Although fights and arguments sometimes happened at that place, they didn’t happen every day. Even if anything went wrong, only a few drunk people shouted loudly. It wasn’t a big issue, and only affected the visitors’ mood.

Nevertheless, Leng Xiaoyao and the others weren’t afraid of trouble, so they chose the closer place.

However, they chose the nearby place not just because it was near, but also because it was a little dangerous. It was Leng Xiaoyao’s decision, so the others didn’t say anything.

The place was only one kilometer away from the hotel. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Xiaoyao, sometimes I feel you prefer quiet, but sometimes you want to join the busyness. Which is the real you?” asked Mu Yiyang.

“Whether I prefer quiet or busyness, it’s me. It’s completely up to my mood,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“You’re right.” Mu Yiyang agreed.

About ten minutes later, they arrived at the night snack street.

It was large and was crowded. Because it was full of activity, it was very noisy.

Although Li Mochen and his friends had high statuses, they weren’t picky and were used to places of different levels. They accepted the noise and busyness of this night snack street.

Those picky, rich heirs might not like this place and might think it is dirty, but not every rich heir was picky, so some visitors who showed up here had high statuses too.

Even if this place wasn’t as clean and quiet as a luxury restaurant, it wasn’t dirty either, some people were just dramatic.

Once Leng Xiaoyao and the others walked into the night snack street, they attracted attention because they were extremely good-looking.

On their way, some women who had drunk a little much came over to ask for their WeChat accounts, but were ignored.

They found a clean and popular restaurant, then ordered a private room and their favorites.

Because there were too many diners, they had to wait for a long while. However, they weren’t in a rush to eat, so they waited patiently.

However, before the dishes were placed on the table, they heard the noises of a fight from outside.

“We really have good luck. Right after we came, we ran into people who want to cause trouble before our dishes are even on the table.” Leng Xiaoyao joked. She thought they might not see people fighting here even if it often happened. Unexpectedly, it happened right after they came.

It was a joke, but they would do something since there were people fighting. As a soldier, Mu Yiyang stood up first.

“Let’s go have a look,” Mu Yiyang said, standing up, and the others followed. Then they went out.

The fight was happening in the restaurant they were in. All the diners ran out of the front hall. Only a bunch of hoodlums were smashing and beating around, swearing loudly.

“What? You denied that you put cockroaches in our grilled fish! And you slandered that they were put by us? Do you want to play tricks and refuse to pay compensation? Are we that easy to bully? If you don’t pay compensation, we’ll smash your restaurant.”

“Right, if you refuse to pay, we’ll smash everything till our anger goes away.”

Saying that, they continued to smash the restaurant.

Although Leng Xiaoyao didn’t know which of them put cockroaches in the food, she wouldn’t allow the bunch of hoodlums to continue before figuring it out.

Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao wanted to step up to stop them, but Li Mochen blocked her. “Leave it to Jiang Han and Mu Fan.”

Before Li Mochen finished, Jiang Han and Mu Fan stood out. Mu Yiyang’s subordinate also went forward. He followed Jiang Han and Mu Fan up.

The three of them were skilled at martial arts, so the bunch of hoodlums were no match for them.

In fact, once Jiang Han and the others stood out, they quickly beat the bunch of hoodlums to the side. The bunch of hoodlums were scared and didn’t dare to fight back.

Because they didn’t know which side was wrong yet, Jiang Han didn’t seriously injure the hoodlums, and instead just stopped them from moving.

“Who are you? It’s none of your business!” the head of the bunch of hoodlums said.

“You’re too noisy. Our mood to have night snacks is being ruined by you,” Jiang Han said.

“We can lower our voice,” the man said. He didn’t think that Jiang Han was standing up for the owner of this restaurant.

“It’s too late. Since we’re involved, we’ll find out the truth,” Mu Fan said.

“You” The man was mad. He didn’t think they were too noisy, Jiang Han just deliberately interfered.

There were other diners, but they said nothing and left.

“Do you know who we are? If you dare go against us, you can’t bear the consequences.” The man threatened. Because he couldn’t defeat them, he could only threaten them.

“It’s not important. We’re not afraid of that. What’s important is finding out who did what,” Leng Xiaoyao said, walking over.

“There are cockroaches in the food. We asked for compensation. They refused and even said that we put the cockroaches inside. We can’t tolerate that,” the man said angrily.

The owner of this restaurant was also angry. “It has nothing to do with us! Our kitchen and ingredients are all very clean. It has never happened before. It’s you who put the cockroaches into the food.”

“It hasn’t happened before, but it doesn’t mean it won’t ever happen.” The man argued.
