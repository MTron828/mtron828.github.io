Chapter 2856: She’s Naive?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Shut up!” The second the woman finished, Jiang Wenliang snapped at her. Then he stood up and glared at the woman. “You’re a bi*ch. I don’t want to talk to you,” said he through his teeth.

“You…” The woman’s face distorted in anger at once. She gave Jiang Wenliang a glare, but didn’t know what to say.

“She’s my woman now. You can’t say that to her!” The fat man was displeased.

Hearing that, onlookers began to guess their relationship. This woman might have been Jiang Wenliang’s wife or girlfriend, but now she was with the fat man.

Although Jiang Wenliang was haggard now, it wasn’t difficult to see that he was a good-looking man.

Why did the woman leave Jiang Wenliang for this fat man? Obviously, the fat man was rich!

Most people didn’t know them, so they weren’t aware of the reason, but some knew why.

“Tell your woman to shut up. She betrayed me. I don’t want to hear her call my name. I don’t want to talk to her either!” shouted Jiang Wenliang. He humiliated the woman, because she cheated on him. He would never forgive her for that.

“You…” The woman was mad that Jiang Wenliang talked about her like that. Especially when the onlookers looked at her with accusatory glances, she really wanted to hide herself away. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Hearing Jiang Wenliang’s words, the onlookers believed their guess was right. The woman had indeed betrayed Jiang Wenliang.

In today’s society, it wasn’t uncommon that men and women betrayed each other, but that didn’t mean that people would accept or understand it. On the contrary, it was disgusting and hateful.

As a result, they disdained the woman.

“Don’t be so mean. She never betrayed you. Fang Lin just made the right choice,” said the fat man. He didn’t care about betrayal at all.

“Ha-ha, ha-ha, the right choice? Yes, that’s true for you two amoral people!” Jiang Wenliang mocked them. They were indeed a perfect match.

Fang Lin betrayed Jiang Wenliang for money, while the fat man also betrayed his wife for her.

However, the two betrayers lived a good life, while the people who were cheated on lived in pain. It was so unfair.

“Jiang Dashun, don’t think that’s the final result. I’ll beat you sooner or later,” said Jiang Wenliang with determination.

“You? Can you beat me? Come on, you lost your ancient house to me. You have nothing. How can you defeat me?” Jiang Dashun said disdainfully. He didn’t think Jiang Wenliang had the ability to defeat him.

Seeing that, Gu Ning couldn’t stand it any longer, so she stood out. “Who told you he has nothing?”

The next moment, everyone turned to look at Gu Ning. They wondered who she was and what she meant.

However, the moment they saw her they were all amazed by her beauty. She was so beautiful!

The woman showed jealousy. They weren’t in the same age group, but she was still jealous of Gu Ning.

“What does he have? Do you want to help him?” Fang Lin asked acidly. She didn’t think a young girl like Gu Ning had the ability to help Jiang Wenliang.

After all, they were totally strangers. It was impossible for her to help him.

Jiang Dashun was also mad and coldly said, “Young girl, it has nothing to do with you. Don’t get involved!”

“Young girl, you shouldn’t be involved. Don’t get into trouble.” Jiang Wenliang kindly warned Gu Ning. He understood Jiang Dashun and Fang Lin very well. If Gu Ning helped him, they would start causing her trouble too.

“Well, I already made up my mind to get involved. Let me see who can cause me trouble!” said Gu Ning arrogantly, then walked to the pile of raw jade materials.

“You…” Gu Ning’s arrogance angered Jiang Dashun and Fang Lin, but no one knew why Gu Ning suddenly walked to the pile of jade raw materials.

“What’s she doing? Didn’t she say she made up her mind to get involved?”

“No idea. Is she going to hit Jiang Dashun with the stones?”

In fact, Jiang Dashun had the same thought, but didn’t think it was likely. Even though the girl dared to interfere, she shouldn’t be able to hurt him.

“How is it possible? It’ll cause a lot of damage.”

“Does she want to do stone-gambling? But that has nothing to do with their conflict.”

“I think she’s going to choose jade raw materials for Jiang Wenliang.”

“Does she think it’s very easy?”

“…”

Thinking of that, the onlookers began to despise Gu Ning.

Gu Ning, however, didn’t care about it at all. After walking toward the large pile of jade raw materials, she quickly picked up three jade raw materials. Among them, there were two pieces of jade.

One was of middle level, while the other was of high level. Although it wasn’t large, it should be worth about twenty million yuan.

With the three jade raw materials, Gu Ning walked to Jiang Wenliang and said, “I’m always good at stone-gambling. Do you dare to try it?”

Seeing her behavior, everyone thought she was crazy. Was she joking?

She randomly picked up several raw jade materials. Why was she so confident? She even said she was always good at stone-gambling. Did she take herself as the queen of stone-gambling?

They had heard that a woman was unbelievably skilled at stone-gambling and people in the industry called her the Queen of Stone-gambling, but the woman was in her twenties, while Gu Ning looked younger than twenty.

Even Jiang Wenliang doubted Gu Ning’s abilities. Stone-gambling was so difficult. How could she be so confident that her choices were right?

However, he somehow felt that Gu Ning wasn’t joking, but it didn’t mean that there was jade in those raw jade materials.

“Ha-ha, ha-ha, young girl, are you kidding? Do you think there is jade in every raw jade material? You know nothing about this industry!” Jiang Dashun laughed at Gu Ning. He was completely amused by her behavior.

“Right, she’s so naive,” said Fang Lin with disdain.

If they believed she was naive, Gu Ning decided to act naive.

“I just think there is jade inside. Why don’t we gamble over that?” said Gu Ning with a naive look.

“Gamble? What do you have to gamble with me?” Jiang Dashun slighted Gu Ning, but didn’t turn her down right away. Anyway, there must be a bet.
