Chapter 1353: The Surveillance Cameras Are Broken

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

However, four policemen among them didn’t think that their director would shoot first, because they were Chang Bingjian’s people.

Zuo Anrong and two other policemen were very dissatisfied with Chang Bingjian’s behavior, but they didn’t say anything before they learned more details.

“You must have done something inappropriate, for our director to shoot first,” the leading policeman said. His name was Yang Ke, and he was also a captain in this branch.

“You can check the surveillance cameras to see who shot first,” Gu Ning said.

“Great, we’ll check the surveillance cameras, but you two must stay here before the truth comes out,” Captain Yang said.

“No problem.” Gu Ning agreed.

She didn’t think that they would let the truth come out, because she was indeed innocent, while Chang Bingjian was guilty. However, she had to stay, because she hadn’t finished what she needed to do here today.

“Get them to the interrogation room.” Captain Yang gave an order, and two policemen walked to Gu Ning and Qiao Ya at once.

“Wait a second.” Gu Ning was displeased. “We’re not suspects or criminals. Why should we sit in the interrogation room? We need an office.”

Gu Ning was reluctant to be humiliated like that.

“You’ve attacked the police, so you’re a suspect,” another policeman said.

“I just defended myself!” Gu Ning argued.

“You...” The policeman still wanted to say something, but Zuo Anrong interrupted him and said to Captain Yang, “Captain Yang, they can stay in the meeting room and we can send two men to check the surveillance cameras.”

They had enough policemen in this branch.

Although Zuo Anrong trusted Gu Ning, he needed solid proof to help her out. Without clear evidence, Gu Ning could be severely punished according to the law.

Captain Yang hesitated for a while, then agreed. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The meeting room was the next room, so Zuo Anrong went to open its door and invited Gu Ning and Qiao Ya to walk inside.

He along with another six policemen stayed to guard Gu Ning and Qiao Ya.

When Gu Ning was seated, she took out her phone to play on, but a policeman snapped at her, “You can’t play on phone here.”

“Is it illegal to play on the phone?” Gu Ning gave him a cold glance, and the policeman closed his mouth.

After that, Gu Ning asked Zuo Anrong, “Captain Zuo, your director is injured and I don’t think he’s able to work now. Why don’t you call your deputy director?”

Zuo Anrong understood Gu Ning’s meaning, and they indeed needed their deputy director’s order right now, so he called their deputy director.

Although their deputy director was on a business trip, he still needed to report it to him.

Several policemen in the room were Chang Bingjian’s people, but they weren’t aware of Chang Bingjian’s relationship with their deputy director. Therefore, they didn’t think it was a bad idea to call their deputy director.

Zuo Anrong told their deputy director that the director was injured and they needed him to manage the work in the branch.

Coincidentally, the deputy director was already back, and he was on his way to the branch now.

When the deputy director heard that Chang Bingjian was injured, he felt excited, but didn’t show it on his face. He told his chauffeur to speed up at once, because he needed to see how serious Chang Bingjian’s injuries were.

He hoped that Chang Bingjian was injured as seriously as possible.

Before long, Captain Yang and his people walked back.

“Sorry, the surveillance cameras on the second and third floor are broken, so we found nothing,” Captain Yang said to Gu Ning.

“What? How is it possible?” Zuo Anrong didn’t believe it.

The next second, Zuo Anrong realized that Captain Yang must have deleted the surveillance videos.

Thinking of that, Zuo Anrong blamed himself for this fault. He just wanted to protect Gu Ning and totally forgot that Captain Yang was Chang Bingjian’s man.

Captain Yang must have done it for Chang Bingjian.

Gu Ning and Qiao Ya, on the other hand, weren’t surprised at all. They knew that Captain Yang would do everything to ruin the evidence.

Nevertheless, they weren’t worried about it at all, because Gu Ning was well-prepared. When she followed Chang Bingjian to the second floor, she took out a miniature camera and recorded everything.

That was the reason why they stayed quiet in the meeting room.

Besides, since those policemen chose to side with Chang Bingjian, Gu Ning made up her mind to teach them a lesson too.

“Well, does it mean that we’re definitely guilty of attacking the police?” Gu Ning asked.

“You’re right,” Captain Yang said.

“Great, but your deputy director is on his way here, and we can wait a while for him,” Gu Ning said. She didn’t want to waste time on them.

Although she didn’t know the deputy director, she understood that he would help her.
