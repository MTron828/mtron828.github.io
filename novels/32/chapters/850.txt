“It’s said that Gu Ning is an excellent student in her school, so it isn’t a surprise that she won the first prize, but how did she manage to do it with full marks? It has never happened before. I can’t believe it.”

“I agree. My uncle is a math teacher in a high school, and even he can’t finish those exercises within such a short time. Gu Ning is just a high school student. I don’t think she’s able to do that on her own. She’s a successful businesswoman now, and it might be easy for her to get the correct answers beforehand.”

“Mind your words! You have to take responsibility for what you just said. How dare you suspect a department of our government? Don’t you feel embarrassed that your uncle, who’s a math teacher in a high school, failed to do better than Gu Ning, who is just a high school student?”

“They’re so mean, and I think they’re simply being jealous.”

“She even gave an excuse that she has a good memory. It must be a lie.”

“Right, why do you support her and believe every word she said? Do you all think that she could finish those math questions on her own?”

“At least we trust the Education Bureau.”

“We trust the Education Bureau, so we won’t make any judgments without any proof.”

“Why don’t you have a look and believe the official statement? Stop spreading rumors!”

“Show us any proof you can get, or you’ll be punished according to the law!”

...

Although many people had suspicions of Gu Ning, there were more Internet users who supported and defended her. In their eyes, Gu Ning was good at everything.

Voice of support soon surpassed those with doubts.

Another while later, the Education Bureau of City B released an official statement to prove that the competition was above board.

Since the contest was fair and public, rumor-makers might be sued if they kept spreading rumors.

Once the official statement was out, the haters stopped attacking Gu Ning. They still held doubts, but didn’t dare to leave comments on the Internet anymore.

Gu Ning, however, didn’t care about it at all. She would focus on her own life, studies and career. She would only take action when the attack became serious.

...

Leng Shaoting called Gu Ning at 1:30 pm, and told her that he was in the capital now.

Gu Ning also told him that she had won the first prize in the math competition. Leng Shaoting felt happy for her, and it wasn’t a surprise in his eyes either.

After hanging up the call with Gu Ning, Leng Shaoting called Master Leng at once.

“Hi, you haven’t called me for a long time! I thought you already forgot that you still have a grandfather,” Master Leng joked.

“Grandpa, I’m in the capital now, and I’ll visit you this afternoon. By the way, your future grand daughter-in-law just won the first prize with full marks in the national math competition,” Leng Shaoting said.

“What? Really?” Master Leng was shocked.

Jiang Zhongyu and Master Xu were also in the room with Master Leng, and they were both astonished at hearing the news.

What? Gu Ning won the competition with full marks?

It’s so unbelievable!

“Ha-ha, ha-ha, very good!” Master Leng laughed out loud. He felt so proud of his talented future grand daughter-in-law.

Afterwards, Master Leng kept showing off Gu Ning’s achievements in front of Jiang Zhongyu and Master Xu. He didn’t stop complimenting Gu Ning until his friends got a little annoyed.

Master Leng just loved to see his friends being envious of him.

...

At 6 pm, all the members of the Tang family were home. Even Cao Ruihua’s family joined the party to congratulate Gu Ning.

It was also the third day after the construction of Shenghua Real Estate began, but nothing bad happened, so people started to believe that the horrifying news about the land was just a rumor.

Gu Ning told Gao Yi and Qiao Ya to pay a lot of attention to the construction, in case her business competitors caused trouble on the construction site.

...

When it was nearly 9 pm, Gu Ning went to Pan Zirui’s bar along with Cao Wenxin.

On their way, Gu Ning called Tang Qingyang and told him to meet her there.

Pan Zirui and his friends were already waiting for them when Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin arrived.

They wouldn’t bring cheap girls with them when they met with Gu Ning now, because they thought that it wasn’t polite and they were respectful of Gu Ning.

Although Gu Ning didn’t mind, it was a good thing to avoid conflicts with those cheap girls.

The second Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin showed up, everyone complimented Gu Ning with sincerity.

A while later, Tang Qingyang arrived, and Gu Ning introduced him to everyone.
