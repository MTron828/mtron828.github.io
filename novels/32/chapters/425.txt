Chapter 426 Win A Fortune

Cao Wenxin guided Gu Ning and Tang Jiakai to a slot machine. They exchanged chips with money before they started to play. Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai were just playing for fun. They weren’t seriously gambling, so each of them got chips for ten thousand yuan and they also exchanged some for Gu Ning. Gu Ning didn’t hesitate and took the chips.

Although slot machines were just a way of gambling with change, a person who was lucky or good at playing it could win hundreds of thousands or even a million yuan. However, it wasn’t easy to do so.

“Ningning, do you know how to play?” Cao Wenxin asked.

“Not really. I’ll watch you playing first,” Gu Ning said.

After that, they came to a slot machine. Cao Wenxin put the chips in and explained, “Single-line betting is 100 chips. You can buy up to 10 lines, which is 1000 chips. If you want a bigger chance, you can bet 1000 chips and buy the line.”

There were 10 reels on the screen, and pictures of 10 different odds on each reel, namely 100 times, 200 times, 300 times, 400 times, 500 times, 600 times, 700 times, 800 times, 900 times, and 1000 times. If the pictures of the same odds all lined up at the same time on the screen, the prize pool would be fully opened. No matter how much money was in it, the machine would spit it all out. The prize pool had at least a hundred million yuan, but this chance was completely negligible. No one had ever succeeded before.

When the game began, 10 reels would randomly spin. The gamer could then press the button to stop it to see whether three pictures of the same odds could line up along a row. The player’s minimum bet was a line. If three pictures of the same odds lined up along the first row, the player could get the money according to the odds.

However, if the player only bought one line, even if there were other pictures of the same odds lined up in other rows, the player still could only get the money for the single line.

Cao Wenxin bet on 10 lines at the same time, but all failed and wasted 1000 chips.

While Cao Wenxin was playing the slot machine, Gu Ning was carefully observing the way the machine worked, and figured out all its secrets.

“Let me try!” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning also bet on all 10 lines. When the chips were in the machine, the game was ready to begin. Gu Ning pulled the spin lever, and the slot machine started with in a loud noise, while all the 10 reels moved fast at the same time.

With her Jade Eyes, Gu Ning was able to calculate when the pictures of different odds would fall on a certain position. When it was time, Gu Ning quickly press the stop button. The slot machine stopped with a sound like someone just slammed on the brakes. And the 10 reels gradually stopped one by one from left to right.

The three of them fixed their eyes on the pictures on the screen.

The first, second, third line all failed, but the pictures of 300 times odds lined up along the fourth reel, which meant that Gu Ning won thirty thousand yuan with this line. The fifth line failed too, but pictures of 100 times and 600 times lined up along the sixth line and ninth line. After this round, Gu Ning won a hundred thousand yuan when she only bet a thousand yuan.

Chips were continuously spun out from the slot machine, which immediately attracted a lot of attention from players around them. They all looked at Gu Ning with envy and jealousy.

“Jesus! Ningning, you’re so awesome!” Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai were both quite surprised because they had never won before. Gu Ning, on the other hand, wasn’t very satisfied with the result, because she had only won three lines. Undoubtedly, she was ambitious to win all the lines.

“Let’s try again, and see whether we can win all of them!” Cao Wenxin said with anticipation, even though she didn’t believe that it was possible, because it was even harder than winning the lottery. However, it was much easier than winning the lottery in Gu Ning’s eyes. As long as she had sharp eyes and agile hands, it was highly possible for her to win.

The second time, Gu Ning still bet on all the lines and seized the best timing to press the stop button.

The pictures of 200 times, 400 times, 500 times, 800 times, and 900 times all lined up in the end, and Gu Ning won two hundred and eighty thousand yuan.

People around her started to discuss her unbelievable luck.

“No way! How can she be so lucky?”

“I’ve played the slot machine thousands of times, but I only won a 100 times once!”

Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai almost jumped up in excitement. “Ningning! It’s so incredible! I admire you so much right now!” Gu Ning, however, still wasn’t satisfied. At this time, more and more people gather around them, because it was very rare to see someone win so much money by playing the slot machines.

During the third round, Gu Ning finally won all the lines and the prize pool was fully opened. Tons of chips were spun out within minutes.

Everyone was shocked and couldn’t believe his or her eyes.

“Don’t stand still. Move and collect the chips!” Gu Ning said to Tang Jiakai and Cao Wenxin. She wasn’t able to collect all the chips by herself. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai didn’t get their mind back until Gu Ning reminded them to move. Seeing the large pile of chips, Cao Wenxin screamed all of a sudden, “Ah! Is-is-is it real?”

Her scream attracted more people in the game room.

Tang Jiakai pinched at Cao Wenxin’s arm, and Cao Wenxin shouted in pain. “What are you doing!”

Tang Jiakai seemed innocent. “You can feel the pain, so it’s real.”

“Oh! It’s real! It’s damn real!” Cao Wenxin jumped in happiness. “Come on! Help me collect all the chips!” Gu Ning lost her patience.

“Alright-alright.” Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai helped Gu Ning collect the chips at once.

Gu Ning understood that she should stop right now, because this place was controlled by a gang, and it wasn’t a good idea if she kept winning money.

When they took all the chips to the counter for money, the worker was stunned. He had never seen anyone be so unbelievably lucky and win so much money.

The chips were 136.27 million yuan in total. Gu Ning transferred thirty million yuan to each of Cao Wenxin’s and Tang Jiakai’s bank account, while Gu Ning took the rest.

Gu Ning won the money by herself, so Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai declined to share with her in the beginning. However, Gu Ning persuaded them to take it, so they accepted in the end.

In fact, although the Tang family and the Cao family were both crazily rich, Cao Winxin and Tang Jiakai didn’t have much allowance. Therefore, thirty million yuan was a fortune for them.
