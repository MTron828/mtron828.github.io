Chapter 2169: Is the Murderer a Ghost?

“It’s really strange. There are surveillance cameras all around, but the murderer could avoid them and kill him. That’s not easy!” Song Miaoge sighed and felt terrified at the same time. The murderer was simply too powerful and killed Song Yang without anybody knowing.

“Hey, is it possible that the murderer is a ghost?” Zhang Zikai suddenly said.

“What?”

Hearing that, Baili Zongxue and Song Miaoge were stunned. Baili Zongxue was surprised because she knew it was a ghost and Zhang Zikai guessed the truth.

Gu Ning’s mouth also twitched slightly, but she knew that Zhang Zikai just casually said that.

Song Miaoge, however, felt that Zhang Zikai had a great imagination to boldly have that idea.

“Zhang Zikai, do you believe that there are ghosts in this world?” Song Miaoge sneered unceremoniously. She didn’t believe that ghosts existed in this world.

“I’m just saying!” Zhang Zikai curled her lips. She didn’t really believe it, and was just saying it. Coincidentally it was the truth. However, neither Baili Zongxue nor Gu Ning would tell them.

After having the meal, they went for a walk on the football field.

“Ever after defeating Ji Wenna, I haven’t practiced martial arts for a long time. Zongxue, help me with the practice!” Song Miaoge suddenly felt interested and wanted to practice.

The reason Song Miaoge called Baili Zongxue to practice with her instead of Gu Ning was because Gu Ning was even stronger than Baili Zongxue. If she asked Gu Ning to practice with her, she was simply asking for abuse.

When Baili Zongxue didn’t use magic power, she was indeed not much better than Song Miaoge, so Baili Zongxue was more appropriate. Although Song Miaoge still couldn’t defeat her, she wouldn’t lose too soon either.

“Sure, I haven’t practiced for a long time either!” Baili Zongxue agreed with alacrity. After she came to study in university, she hadn’t practiced kung fu for a long time, so she got interested too.

After that, they began to fight against each other.

Their kung fu competition attracted many onlookers.

When they recognized Gu Ning, they became even more excited.

Gu Ning was already very famous at school, so even her friends were known to many people, and people also knew that Baili Zongxue and Song Miaoge were good at martial arts.

They weren’t only beautiful, but were also good at martial arts, which made them dream girls in many boys’ eyes. As a result, they had a lot of admirers.

Unfortunately, none of the admirers could attract their interest. Baili Zongxue wouldn’t have a mortal as her boyfriend and Song Miaoge wouldn’t date her schoolmates either.

Although Zhang Zikai’s admirers weren’t as outstanding as Baili Zongxue’s and Song Miaoge’s, there were many of them. There were also male schoolmates who left a good impression on Zhang Zikai, but she wouldn’t easily get into a romantic relationship, especially in her freshman year.

Both Baili Zongxue and Song Miaoge had their own supporters cheering for them. In the end, Song Miaoge lost, but Baili Zongxue didn’t let her lose too badly because there were many people watching.

Although Song Miaoge lost, those who supported her weren’t disappointed.

In a blink of an eye, it was Friday again.

Song Miaoge said that they hadn’t gone out together for so long, so she asked whether they were free and could hang out.

It happened that Chu Peihan was in the WeChat group as well and asked her if she had time, and they could hang out.

Hao Ran and the others had many complaints. They all regretted not coming to the capital to study. Seeing that Gu Ning and the others often hung out, they were unhappy because they hadn’t seen Gu Ning and the others for so long.

Anyway, they chose their universities, so they had to stick to them even if they were unhappy now.

Because Gu Ning was free this afternoon and evening, she agreed to meet Chu Peihan and the others.

However, Song Miaoge had asked her out many times and she turned her down every time. She felt it wasn’t a good thing to keep turning Song Miaoge down, so Gu Ning asked Chu Peihan whether she could bring Song Miaoge and her other friends with her. If Chu Peihan didn’t mind, they would hang out together.

Chu Peihan definitely didn’t mind and brought one of her close friends with her too. Moreover, they had met Song Miaoge and the others before. They weren’t very familiar, but they weren’t strangers.

Most importantly, Gu Ning’s friends were their friends too. They would get along well together, because they strongly believed that Gu Ning’s friends were reliable.

After that, Gu Ning asked Song Miaoge and her other friends for their opinions, and they all agreed. They thought it would be more fun if more people could gather together. Therefore, they set out together after their classes were over.

In this cold weather, everyone wanted to eat hot pot, so that’s what they decided to have.

Once they finished the meal, they went to sing in a KTV.

Because their schools were all in the Haicheng District, they dined and had fun in a KTV in the Haicheng District.

Chu Peihan arrived first. She came with Shi Xiaoyue. Mu Ke and Yu Mixi came later. In the end, Gu Ning brought Baili Zongxue and the others. They weren’t too late.

After they met, they introduced themselves and exchanged greetings.

“Hey, where is your older brother?” Chu Peihan asked Baili Zongxue.

When Chu Peihan asked Baili Zongxue about Baili Zongyang, she seemed to be in love and was totally different from her usual self, which surprised Shi Xiaoyue and caused her to become alert.

Did Chu Peihan admire Baili Zongxue’s older brother?

Baili Zongxue was so beautiful, so her older brother must be handsome too. If so, her older cousin would be in danger.

When Chu Peihan asked Baili Zongxue about her older brother, she seemed to be in love, but she was very violent to Han Chenglin. There was a huge gap!

Shi Xiaoyue felt sorry for her older cousin, but no matter what, she had to help him.

“He should be at home now,” said Baili Zongxue. She didn’t hate Chu Peihan’s attitude towards Baili Zongyang, although she didn’t know how Chu Peihan felt about Baili Zongyang. She only hoped Chu Peihan didn’t have special feelings for Baili Zongyang, because it was impossible for them to be together.

“Will you run tomorrow morning?” Chu Peihan asked, showing obvious anticipation.

Baili Zongxue was amused and said, “As long as it’s not rainy, we usually get up to run in the morning.”

“Great, boss, I’ll go to stay in your place tonight. I’ll meet my dream man tomorrow ‘coincidentally,'” said Chu Peihan to Chu Peihan.

“Sure, but I’ll be busy tomorrow. I can’t treat you,” said Gu Ning.

“It’s fine. I can enjoy myself with Zongxue. Even if Zongxue isn’t free, I can stay with Beiying,” said Chu Peihan. She wasn’t a kid so she didn’t need Gu Ning to take care of her.
