Chapter 1458: Keep Waiting

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Is Gu Ning’s company here?” Wu Shunhua said in astonishment.

“I don’t think so. There must be many companies in this building. Although Gu Ning is very successful, she can’t afford such a skyscraper,” Dongfang Ziyu said. She didn’t disdain Gu Ning, it was a very normal thought.

A company needed a healthy cash flow to run its business. Even if Colaine had over hundreds of millions of yuan in assets, it only had a cash flow of a hundred of million yuan at the most. Therefore, it wasn’t very likely for Gu Ning to buy or rent such an expensive office building when she didn’t have enough money.

They only knew that Colaine was owned by Gu Ning, and had no idea whether she had other companies. In addition, she could be coming to visit her friend’s company.

However, the truth was that this skyscraper indeed belonged to Gu Ning and the building which was still under construction behind it was also owned by Gu Ning. Both of these two buildings were very high and large with beautiful green plants.

It cost a lot to have such a big area to build office buildings in the capital where the land price was extremely high. Moreover, as Gu Ning’s company was expanding, she was going to have more office buildings in other major cities.

Because the Shengning Organization wasn’t officially established yet, its name wasn’t put on the building so outsiders didn’t know that the two beautiful office buildings actually belonged to the same business group. Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua weren’t aware of it either.

Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see outside after she walked into the building, and saw Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua waiting in the car. They stayed in the car till she was back in her office.

Gu Ning wondered if they would keep waiting until she left the building then continue to follow her. If so, Gu Ning didn’t mind at all. As long as she wanted to get rid of them, she could do that at any minute.

...

Gu Ning didn’t spend much time on this short trip, and only stayed outside for one and a half hours. Leng Shaoting was playing the game in Gu Ning’s office that entire time.

When he was free these days in the military base, he always chose to play the game.

Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng were greatly surprised when they saw their leader playing the game. They soon found out that the game was Battle in the Sky

, which was developed by Gu Ning’s company, so they got curious and downloaded the same game later.

It was a game released by Gu Ning’s company after all, and they were both single and had a lot of free time to kill.

Xu Jinchen used to play games on his computer and he knew a lot about games, but he was still no match for Leng Shaoting. Chen Meng, on the other hand, had never played online games before, so it took him a long time to get familiar with it.

After a few days, Chen Meng finally had the courage to play a round with other players in the game, but he was killed in seconds because of his poor skills. As a result, Xu Jinchen had already reached Level 20, but Chen Meng was still at Level 7.

Leng Shaoting, Xu Jinchen, and Chen Meng stayed in the military base recently while the other members of the Red Flame were busy dealing with other things. They stayed to train high-level special forces. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Although the Red Flame was an independent team, they would go to military bases to train high-level special forces. They were top soldiers in the army, so no one else was more qualified than them to train the high-level special forces.

...

Once Gu Ning showed up, Leng Shaoting asked her, “How is it?”

“They came for the magical power in Colaine’s medicines,” Gu Ning said. “Although they made an excuse, trying to cooperate with me, I turned them down but they wouldn’t give up. They’re still waiting for me in a car outside of the building now.”

“Will it be dangerous?” Leng Shaoting was worried about Gu Ning’s safety. Even though they were members of the Good Practice, cultivators were too strong and sometimes aggressive.

“Don’t worry, I have the flood dragon’s help,” Gu Ning said. She knew that she wasn’t comparable to Dongfang Ziyu, but she wasn’t worried at all because she had the flood dragon to help her.

Leng Shaoting nodded and relaxed a little. He couldn’t stay by her side and protect her at all times after all. And even if he could do that, he wasn’t stronger than Gu Ning and was still at a low level as a cultivator.

After a short while, it was time for lunch. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting dined in the cafeteria.

Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua were unwilling to leave, so Wu Shunhua went to buy fast food and they directly had their lunch in the car.
