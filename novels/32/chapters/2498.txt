Chapter 2499: Crazily Selfish

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Although Jing Yaorong treated Jing Yunyao badly, he was nice to Jing Yanhua. Anyway, he had never exploited Jing Yanhua.

Because Jing Yanhua was always obedient, Jing Yaorong didn’t bother to see Jing Yanhua as his enemy. However, if Jing Yanhua dared to behave against him, he would change his attitude towards him.

Jing Yaorong was not tolerant, and he wouldn’t listen to other people’s opinions.

Jing Yaorong also didn’t have outstanding abilities, since the Jing family was losing its influence under his leadership, but the Jing family was still powerful. At least other major families who tried to remove it all failed. Till now, the Jing family was still one of the four major families, although it was the least influential.

There weren’t many cultivators in the cultivation world, but there were about seven influential families.

Among them, two families were comparable to the four major families, and had the ambition to become new major families.

After hearing Jing Yaorong’s words, Jing Yanhua was struck dumb for a second.

He wasn’t displeased because Jing Yaorong was suspicious of him. After all Jing Jining was his son, and was aware that Jing Yunyao was still alive, so it was understandable that Jing Yaorong was suspicious of him.

However, he honestly had no idea that Jing Yunyao wasn’t dead, so he sincerely said, “Yaorong, I swear I don’t know that Yunyao is still alive. I was also shocked when you told me that. You should know that Jining had a very good relationship with Yunyao. If he knows that Yunyao is still alive, do you think he’d tell anyone else in the Jing family?”

“If Jining really kept it a secret, I should apologize to you on his behalf, but it’s not his fault that he wants to protect Yunyao. So please, Yaorong, don’t blame Jining,” said Jing Yanhua.

“As a member of the Jing family, how could he keep it a secret? Isn’t he afraid that Jing Yunyao will come back and cause us trouble one day?” said Jing Yaorong. It was clear that he blamed Jing Jining for that.

In the old days, he would let Jing Jining go, but now Jing Jining became a threat to him, so it was impossible for him to do nothing.

Jing Yanhua was mad. “Yaorong, although you never admit that Yunyao’s death has something to do with you, it’s not a secret. We all know it. Yunyao broke the rules of the cultivation world, but I don’t think she should have been sentenced to death. Tiandaozong only decided to chase her out of the cultivation world and didn’t allow her to come in again. However, you insisted on killing her. She’s your daughter! Even a monster would not hurt its own children. I sincerely don’t understand how you could be so cruel?”

Hearing that, Jing Yaorong became angrier. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Because Jing Yaorong was aware that everyone knew he caused Jing Yunyao’s death, he didn’t bother to deny it when Jing Yanhua pointed it out. “She humiliated the Jing family. She couldn’t live!”

Jing Yaorong didn’t think he was wrong. Instead, he believed that he was right. “Did you get your honor back after killing Yunyao? No, you ruined your own reputation. Many people now agree that you’re a cold -blooded, cruel father, and that you don’t deserve your kids!” Jing Yanhua argued. Even though he had never talked about that with Jing Yaorong before, he couldn’t tolerate it any longer.

“You...” Jing Yaorong was furious, but Jing Yanhua’s words made sense. Therefore, he didn’t argue with Jing Yanhua. However, he still thought that he was right. At least, he felt much better after killing Yunyao.

Besides, he disliked people who criticized him behind his back. It was his family affair. It had nothing to do with them!

“It’s none of your business!” Jing Yaorong angrily shouted. Whether he was wrong or not, he wouldn’t allow other people to judge him.

“Yes, it’s not my business, but Jining is my son. You can ask him about it, but I won’t allow you to hurt him. He’s my son, and I care about him,” said Jing Yanhua. He only summoned up his courage to act against Jing Yaorong when it was related to Jing Yanhua.

If he said nothing when Jing Yaorong hurt Jing Jining, he would be an unqualified father.

The Jing family wouldn’t disable or even kill Jing Jining, but the punishment would be serious, so Jing Yanhua had to stop it from happening.

“He betrayed the Jing family by harboring our enemy. Why can’t I punish him!” Jing Yaorong lost his temper.

“Yaorong, do you really think everyone has to listen to you no matter what you do? You wanted to kill Yunyao. Do you expect her to forgive you?” Jing Yanhua mocked. He didn’t think that Jing Yaorong was dumb. Jing Yaorong was simply too selfish, crazily selfish.

“As a member of the Jing family, she ought to protect our family’s reputation, but what did she do? She did the opposite!” said Jing Yaorong. He was implying that Jing Yunyao had no right to hate him.

“Fine, I can’t interfere in your grudge with Yunyao, but Jining is my son. If you dare to hurt Jining, I’ll report it to the head of Tiandaozong.” Jing Yanhua realized that Jing Yaorong wouldn’t listen to him, so he stopped arguing.

He said that he wouldn’t get involved in Jing Yaorong’s grudge with Jing

Yunyao, not because he was cold-blooded, but because Jing Yaorong couldn’t really hurt Jing Yunyao. If the woman was really Jing Yunyao, Shangguan Yang would protect her.

“You...” Jing Yaorong was furious. “How could you say that to me!”

It was the first time that Jing Yanhua had stood up against him, so Jing Yaorong couldn’t accept it.

“Because Jining is my son, and I’ll protect him with my life.” Jing Yanhua argued. Jing Yaorong could kill Yunyao, but he was protective of his kid.

Even if Jing Jining made the same mistake as Jing Yunyao and got together with a mortal, Jing Jining could be punished according to the rules of the cultivation world, but he wouldn’t hurt his son further.

If his son really fell in love, he would allow his son to leave the cultivation world and live a happy life..
