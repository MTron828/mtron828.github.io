Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting decided to find a remote place to put their car into her telepathic eye space later, after which they would go to the airport in a car arranged by the hotel tomorrow morning.

When it was almost 9 pm, Gu Ning told Shangguan Yang to stay in the suite, and that they would be back in a while.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t stay outside for long, and came back in half an hour.

Leng Shaoting wanted to have some private time with Gu Ning, but they couldn’t leave Shangguan Yang alone in the hotel for too long. Shangguan Yang was an adult, but he knew nothing about the new world. He still needed to learn a lot about modern society.

Leng Shaoting would hire a cook, and a chauffeur for Shangguan Yang after they arrived at the capital.

Shangguan Yang preferred to live in a quiet place, so he didn’t want many people to stay by his side.

Leng Shaoting seldom came back to the capital, so Gu Ning would visit Shangguan Yang more often.

In his daily life, Shangguan Yang could meditate, read books, use his computer, or go around with the help of his chauffeur. Shangguan Yang wouldn’t feel bored when he lived alone, because he had stayed in the tower for hundreds of years before.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting reminded Shangguan Yang to take good care of himself, and Shangguan Yang felt quite satisfied with his life as long as he had delicious foods and good drinks.

Shangguan Yang also learned about Leng Shaoting’s job, so he wouldn’t force him to practice his cultivation every day.

Nevertheless, Leng Shaoting wouldn’t be lazy either, because he had his goal.

...

All of them had the habit of getting up early in the morning, so they were awake at 6 am the next day. They went to have breakfast together at 7 am.

Leng Shaoting went to check out later, and they went to the airport in a car arranged by the hotel.

It was several minutes past 8 pm, so they waited for their flight in the lounge.

Shangguan Yang felt excited when he saw planes flying up in the air. He sometimes even exclaimed and attracted a lot of attention from other passengers.

Gu Ning felt slightly embarrassed, while Leng Shaoting felt nothing.

Some unkind people couldn’t help but laugh at Shangguan Yang. “Where does he come from? Hasn’t he seen planes before?”

“He’s so rude.”

“He’s shouting and yelling!”

Hearing that, Gu Ning turned to face them. “Don’t be so mean. My grandfather is simply very excited to take a plane for the first time.”

Gu Ning argued with them because she didn’t want other people to humiliate Shangguan Yang.

The salesman in the smartphone store had done the same thing yesterday, and Shangguan Yang defended her as well.

“It’s fine. I don’t mind it,” Shangguan Yang said to comfort Gu Ning. He knew that Gu Ning stood up for him, but he really didn’t care about other people’s opinions.

“I don’t want them to humiliate you in public,” said Gu Ning. In her eyes, Shangguan Yang was a very kind old man.

Shangguan Yang said nothing further, but he felt touched.

They waited for a while longer before they went aboard. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Because they booked plane tickets a little late, there were no vacant seats in the first class. Luckily, they successfully booked three seats in the same row so that they could sit together.

Shangguan Yang sat on the window seat, Leng Shaoting sat in the middle, while Gu Ning sat on the aisle seat.

When the plane started to slide, a stewardess reminded the passengers to turn off their phones.

Gu Ning told Shangguan Yang to turn off his phone and told him why he should do that when the plane was about to take off. Since everything was new in Shangguan Yang’s eyes, she needed to explain everything to him.

This was the first time that Shangguan Yang had ever taken a plane, but he soon got used to it.

About one and half an hours later, they arrived at City Qing. There they needed to wait for another two hours for their next flight from City Qing to the capital.

During this time, they could have their lunch. So because they didn’t have much time, they went to have a hot pot.

When they were ordering food, the waiter was surprised, because they ordered much more food than the amount three people could eat. Nevertheless, although the waiter thought it was too much, he didn’t say anything about it.
