Chapter 2106: Look Guilty

Thinking of what had happened ten years ago, Miao Jingjing trembled in anger.

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were familiar with the name of Hong Yifeng. When they just arrived in the cultivation world, they met the shameless person who wanted to dine with them at a hotel. He was hateful at first glance and didn’t seem to be a good guy.

“Hong Yifeng?” Jing Yunyao frowned when she heard that name and looked displeased because Hong Yifeng had made things difficult for her and Jing Jining.

Because Hong Yifeng was Jing Yunfei’s friend, while they were a thorn in Jing Yunfei’s side, Hong Yifeng naturally bullied them along with Jing Yunfei.

Although she could easily kill Hong Yifeng given her current level, Jing Yunyao wouldn’t kill Hong Yifeng for Miao Jingjing. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

If Miao Jingjing was going to take revenge, she could do it with her own hands and Jing Yunyao would only help her a little.

“I promise I’ll catch Hong Yifeng and bring him to you, but you must kill him with your own hands. Before you finish your revenge, I won’t punish you, but you must give up your level after it’s done if you don’t want to be killed. Before you take revenge, you must listen to my arrangements. Don’t go anywhere,” said Jing Yunyao.

“No problem, as long as I can take revenge, I’m willing to die,” said Miao Jingjing. If it hadn’t been for revenge, she would have killed herself already. It was torture for her to live with those memories.

“Shaoting, Ningning, do you mind?” Jing Yunyao asked Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning. Although she already made the decision, she needed to ask for their opinions.

“Of course not,” said Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning. They didn’t get involved in it from the very beginning precisely because they wanted Jing Yunyao to deal with it.

“Yunyao, who are they?” Miao Jingjing asked Jing Yunyao curiously.

“My son and daughter-in-law,” said Jing Yunyao. She didn’t bother to keep it secret. Anyway, Miao Jingjing was under their control, so she wasn’t worried that Miao Jingjing would tell other people.

Knowing that, Miao Jingjing was a little surprised. She didn’t expect Jing Yunyao to have a son.

She soon figured it out after remembering what had happened to Jing Yunyao that year. Jing Yunyao fell in love with a mortal, then was punished and chased away after it was exposed. The young man must be the son of Jing Yunyao and the mortal.

Surprisingly, Jing Yunyao’s son inherited the blood of cultivators and became a high level cultivator.

Jing Yunyao’s daughter-in-law seemed to be in the Fusion Stage, but she was as strong as cultivators in the Golden Core Stage. In addition, she was able to hide her level so that other people couldn’t see it. It was quite unbelievable.

She wasn’t curious to ask about it any longer, because they wouldn’t tell her even if she asked them. So there was no need for her to do such a meaningless thing!

She only knew that she could take revenge as long as she listened to Jing Yunyao’s arrangement.

…

When Gu Ning and the others were on their way to the siheyuan, Baili Zongyang were already home. Because she had a secret, she felt guilty to see Baili Zongyang.

Because she learned Gu Ning’s secret, but she couldn’t tell her own older brother, she could only avoid him. Therefore, once she was home, Baili Zongxue greeted Baili Zongyang who sat in the living room, then immediately went back to her room.

Baili Zongyang, however, noticed Baili Zongxue’s abnormal behavior, so he called her to stop. “Why do you look guilty? What happened?”

Hearing that, Baili Zongxue was scared and did her best to calm down as if nothing had happened. “Nothing!”

“Nothing?” Baili Zongyang squinted at Baili Zongxue. “I don’t think so.”

Baili Zongyang wasn’t going to scold Baili Zongxue, but she was very abnormal today. He was worried that she might be in love with a mortal, which wasn’t allowed.

“Oh!” Baili Zongxue felt Baili Zongyang would be suspicious of her if she couldn’t think of a good reason. However, if he kept on asking her about it, she wouldn’t be able to hide the secret for long, so she made up a lie. “Well, I just heard noises in the grass when I came home. I gave a glance and saw a man and a woman… I didn’t expect them to be so bold. I’m so embarrassed now!”

Hearing that, Baili Zongyang was awkward too and stopped asking more questions. He didn’t doubt Baili Zongxue’s words. After a light cough, he stopped looking at Baili Zongxue. “Alright, go back to you room now.”

Baili Zongxue nodded, then went to her room right away.

At the same time, Gu Ning and the others arrived back at siheyuan.

When they were outside, the evil cultivator didn’t feel the siheyuan had anything special, but the siheyuan was filled with magical power once she walked inside. However, she couldn’t see it at all from the outside.

It seemed there was a formation here, but she knew nothing about it, so she didn’t know what kind of formation it was.

It wasn’t late, just about 9 pm, so Shangguan Yang was still up. He was reading in the study.

The moment the evil cultivator walked in siheyuan, Shangguan Yang felt it, but he did nothing because Gu Ning had just called him. So he knew that they would come with an evil cultivator. However, he didn’t know what had happened yet.

After walking into the siheyuan, they directly went to Shangguan Yang’s yard. Shangguan Yang also walked out when he felt them coming.

The moment the evil cultivator saw Shangguan Yang, she felt greatly stressed and knew that he was a very strong senior cultivator.

“This is the elder of the Kunlun Sect, Senior Shangguan Yang.” Jing Yunyao introduced Shangguan Yang to Miao Jingjing.

Although Miao Jingjing hadn’t seen Shangguan Yang before, she had heard about him, so she was amazed when she learned that he was Shangguan Yang. Without delay, she knelt down on one knee, covering a palm with another. “Junior Miao Jingjing, honored to see Senior Shangguan,” she said respectfully.

“Get up now,” said Shangguan Yang.

“Thanks, Senior Shangguan.” Miao Jingjing thanked him and stood up.

“Senior Shangguan, she’s an old acquaintance of mine. She took the wrong path because of a long-standing grudge. I didn’t have the heart to kill her, so I plan to deprive her of her magical skills after she takes revenge,” said Jing Yunyao.

“Sure, if you need my help, feel free to let me know,” said Shangguan Yang. He didn’t stop Jing Yunyao. Although the evil cultivators weren’t welcome, it didn’t mean that all of them were crazy and evil.

“She’ll stay with me during this time. We’ll figure out a way to lead her enemy out of the cultivation world,” said Jing Yunyao.

“Sure.” Shangguan Yang nodded.

Afterwards, Jing Yunyao and Gu Ning took Miao Jingjing away and arranged a room for her.

“You can cultivate and recover with the magical power here these days. You need to be strong enough to kill Hong Yifeng,” said Jing Yunyao.
