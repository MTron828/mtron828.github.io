Chapter 1008 Xianghe Antique

When they arrived at the airport, they went to get their flight tickets.Gu Ning already booked flight tickets for Hao Ran and her other friends, and Tang Yunfan had booked some for Mrs. Hao and Gu Man’s other friends.

They would leave on the same flight.

...

Hao Ran and the others would leave at 2:10 pm, while Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei would leave at 2:40 pm.

That being the case, Hao Ran and the others went into the lounge after taking the tickets, while Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei went to sit in a restaurant for a while.

Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei didn’t leave Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin until 1:50 pm. They needed to get into the lounge half an hour before the departure time.

When it was time for them to say good-bye to each other, they all wished that time could stop at this moment.

...

“Ningning, where are you going next?” Cao Wenxin asked Gu Ning when Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei were gone.

“I’m going to the antique street. How about you?” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning planned to send some real antiques to Xiangyun Antique-store.

Du Laifeng told her that he had sold several real antiques a few days ago.

Before she left for Burma, she also needed to send some real antiques to the Xiangyun Antique-store in the capital.

The branch of Xiangyun Antique-store in the capital was a famous store with a long history, so it was more popular than that in City B.

Both of them were running out of real antiques, so Gu Ning needed to replenish the stocks.

“Um, I have nothing else to do, so I’ll go with you,” Cao Wenxin said.

“Sure!” Gu Ning said, then they went to the antique street together.

...

On their way there, Cao Wenxin played on her phone reading the news.

When she read a piece of the latest news, she was astonished and exclaimed, “Jesus, there is an antique store at the antique street, which had a sudden collapse this morning and broke many real antiques. The owner of it suffers a loss of thirty million yuan!”

Hearing that, Gu Ning cocked her eyebrow. “What’s its name?”

“Xianghe Antique,”Cao Wenxin said.

Gu Ning had heard of it from Du Laifeng’s mouth, and he told her that the store always looked creepy because it collected too many ancient objects from graves.

An idea dawned on Gu Ning. She thought that the antique store might be filled with Yin since the owner had collected too many ancient objects from graves, which could be the cause of the collapse.

It was possible, but there also could be another reason.

Anyway, Gu Ning decided to have a look herself. She was curious about the sources of those ancient objects too.

“Oh, look at this comment. Someone says that the store collapsed because it’s full of too much Yin.”

Cao Wenxin was amused by the above comment, because she didn’t believe in Yin at all.

Gu Ning, however, was struck dumb for a second. She held the same idea, and thought that it was highly possible now.

“There is another comment saying that those real antiques Xianghe Antique just bought are harmful to human bodies!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Cao Wenxin couldn’t believe her eyes, although it actually might be the truth.

“Well, more people believe that the building is too old, and some think that it might have been done by the owner’s enemies.”

When they had almost reached the antique street, Gu Ning’s and Cao Wenxin’s phones rang at the same time. They didn’t bother to check the caller’s name, because they knew that it must be a call from Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei.

Gu Ning was driving, so she put on her blue-tooth earphones.

Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei told Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin that they were already in the plane. They would fly over to visit them again during the next vacation. Then they chatted for a short while, and hung up.

...

Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei sat in the second row on the left side of the first class.

Leng Shaoting sat by the window, while Xin Bei sat in the aisle seat.

Both of them were tall, handsome young men, so they attracted a lot of attention from the stewardesses once they were aboard.

They were already used to it, and ignored all of the stewardesses.

Those stewardesses were heart-broken. They all wished to find a rich, handsome young boyfriend like them, and they wondered what kind of woman could have them.

What they didn’t know was that they actually felt quite lucky to have their girlfriend.

Neither Leng Shaoting nor Xin Bei thought that women should love them just because of their outstanding appearances. On the contrary, they didn’t enjoy the feeling when every woman was paying attention to them. They were both loyal to their girlfriends, and wouldn’t bother to flirt with other females.

Although those stewardesses couldn’t attract their attention, they still tried, but were doomed to fail.

...

Gu Ning stopped the car at the parking lot of the antique street, then told Cao Wenxin to buy two bottles of water.

Afterwards, she pretended to pick up something from the trunk, but actually took out a wooden box with around 10 pieces of real antiques inside from the telepathic eye space.

When Cao Wenxin came back, she saw the wooden box in Gu Ning’s hands. “Ningning, where did you get so many real antiques?” she asked with curiosity.
