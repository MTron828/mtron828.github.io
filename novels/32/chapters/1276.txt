Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

She passed every turn quickly and smoothly, and even left the No.5 racing car far behind, which was really impressive.

When they saw a girl stepping out of the No.2 racing car, they were shocked again. Some of them also recognized that the girl was exactly Gu Ning.

Those who were familiar with Gu Ning’s previous achievements weren’t shocked, because they were already used to it. In their eyes, Gu Ning was able to do anything well. However, what happened next scared them.

Gu Ning directly cut off the No.5 race driver’s little finger.

After hearing Gu Ning’s argument with Masaichi Yoshida, they began to understand why Gu Ning did that.

“Jesus, it’s so scary.”

“It indeed looks frightening, but I think the man from Country R is really rude and disgusting.”

“Right, although I don’t like violence, I have to say that I feel pleased.”

“Me too.”

...

“How dare he lay out such a shameless condition in front of Goddess Gu? He asked for the punishment.”

One of Gu Ning’s fans showed up on the Internet.

“Do you know this girl? Why do you call her Goddess Gu?”

“Search Goddess Gu on the Internet, and you’ll know.”

Therefore, many people who were curious about Goddess Gu went to search for more information about her.

...

“No wonder this girl looks so powerful. She’s Goddess Gu!”

“I support Goddess Gu.”

“I think that Goddess Gu did the right thing, because the man from Country R is really rude and aggressive.”

“Goddess Gu is still willing to pay the medical fee. I think she’s very nice.”

...

“Oh, I just learned more information about Goddess Gu. She’s beautiful, excellent at studying, a business genius, and a kung fu master!”

“I’m her fan now.”

“She’s so unbelievable.”

Many Internet users began to compliment Gu Ning.

At the same time, haters were also active.

“Goddess Gu? Ridiculous. She’s so young and so cruel. She isn’t qualified to be an idol.”

“Right, she should be put in jail.”

“...” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

They criticized Gu Ning simply because they hated her, and they completely ignored what Masaichi Yoshida had done.

However, Gu Ning’s fans defended her without hesitation and those haters had to close their mouths.

Although it was inappropriate that Gu Ning cut off Masaichi Yoshida’s little finger violently, Masaichi Yoshida was too shameless and aggressive.

Many Internet users @(mentioned) some famous race drivers on Weibo and they were amazed by Gu Ning’s driving skills too. As for Gu Ning’s cruel behavior, they didn’t think it was a problem and hoped that she wouldn’t be involved in more trouble in the future.

...

In the hospital, Masaichi Yoshida called his father after the wound was treated. He didn’t dare to hide the truth from his father, nor did he distort it because he knew that it would only make the situation more complicated and difficult to deal with.

Although Masaichi Yoshida’s father was very angry when he heard the bad news, he also understood that it was Masaichi Yoshida’s fault.

Nevertheless, he was unwilling to give in, so he decided to secretly get revenge on Gu Ning for Masaichi Yoshida.

Masaichi Yoshida’s family wasn’t the most powerful family in Country R, but it was still very rich and influential, and Masaichi Yoshida came to City G with four bodyguards.

The four bodyguards didn’t show up until Masaichi Yoshida needed them. Because Masaichi Yoshida was a student, it wasn’t suitable for the four bodyguards to follow him all day long.

Masaichi Yoshida listened to his father and told his bodyguards to secretly get revenge on Gu Ning.

He didn’t know much about Gu Ning, so he turned to Lin Fei. However, before he left to do that, he saw the news on the Internet and got angry again. He and his schoolmates were amid criticisms now.

In this way, he accidentally learned Gu Ning’s real identity.

To his surprise, Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl. In that case, it wouldn’t be easy for him to get revenge on her. Nevertheless, he was unwilling to give up.

No matter what would happen, Masaichi Yoshida still wanted to try. He didn’t tell his father and made the decision on his own.

...

When Gu Ning wanted to leave, Lin Fei invited her to share a meal together in order to thank her.

Lin Fei’s friends also hoped that Gu Ning could stay here for a while longer. They truly admired Gu Ning, so they wanted to spend more time with her.

Gu Ning thought for a while, then agreed.

Lin Fei brought Gu Ning to the Huangdeng Hotel.

As a first-tier city, there were many five-star hotels in City G, but most people still preferred the Huangdeng Hotel.

The Huangdeng Hotel was famous for its service and dishes.
