Chapter 2199: What Favor?

“Why are you turning to me for help?” Gu Ning asked. She didn’t say whether she believed Qu Hanjiao’s explanation or not, but Qu Hanjiao understood that it wasn’t easy for Gu Ning to trust her. After all, given their bad relationship, it was convincing that she tried to kill two birds with one stone.

“Because the person I want to pay back is very influential. After my father was caught, the Qu family is now under the control of my uncle. My family is helpless now without money and influence. I can’t do anything to those who hurt me. I know you’re strong, so I can only turn to you for help. I understand I was very bad to you, so you might refuse to help me, but I honestly don’t know what to do now…” said Qu Hanjiao, then cried squatting on the ground.

Once Qu Hanjiao started crying, she attracted a lot of attention. People around them glanced at her, then at Gu Ning. It appeared as if they felt Gu Ning had bullied Qu Hanjiao.

Gu Ning had the same feeling, so she was displeased and snapped. “Be quiet!”

Hearing that, Qu Hanjiao stopped crying at once. She was scared of Gu Ning.

“If you cry without caring where you are, other people might think I bullied you,” said Gu Ning in annoyance.

“S-Sorry, I didn’t mean to…” Qu Hanjiao realized she just lost her composure, so she apologized at once. She was most afraid of Gu Ning now.

“Who do you want to pay back?” Gu Ning asked. She asked that because she agreed to help, but not out of kindness. She simply wanted to solve the problem caused by her.

Because of her interference, Qu Hanjiao failed to take revenge. If it hadn’t been for her, Qu Hanjiao might have successfully cooperated with Zhao Xiaoxi and taken revenge, even if she had to die in the end.

Gu Ning’s interference ruined her last chance to take revenge, but she saved her life, which was equal. However, the bad people got away with it. She didn’t owe Qu Hanjiao, but those bad people weren’t punished. Therefore, Gu Ning felt it was better to solve the problem if it was possible.

Hearing Gu Ning’s question, Qu Hanjiao thought Gu Ning must be willing to help her, so her face lit up and she said, “The people I want to pay back are called Yuan Yiyang, Zhao Jie, and Wang Fei. Yuan Yiyang is Yuan Shuyan’s older cousin and Zhao Jie and Wang Fei are members of the Yuan family’s faction. They raped me and caused my womb to tear and bleed. I can no longer become a mother. I hate them. I hate them to death, but I’m not able to kill them. I don’t dare to hire other people to punish them, because I’m afraid they are not influential enough to punish them. They might hurt me again…”

Qu Hanjiao was born in a rich family after all, so she didn’t have a large friend circle. She could only pay some gangsters to do things for her, but those gangsters were nobodies compared with people like Yuan Yiyang.

The Yuan family! It was the Yuan family again. It seemed the Yuan family had done many bad deeds.

Yuan Shuyan’s older cousin, Yuan Yiyang, was Ji Wenna’s fiancé. Gu Ning wondered whether Ji Wenna was aware that her fiancé was a rapist. Either way, it was none of her business. However, Qu Hanjiao was raped by them and her womb tore and bled and she couldn’t be pregnant again, which was too cruel.

“How much can you pay?” Gu Ning asked. She asked because she was willing to teach Yuan Yiyang and the others a lesson, but it wouldn’t be free.

“I-I only have a hundred and fifty thousand yuan,” said Qu Hanjiao. Because the Qu family’s company was under the control of her uncle now, her family didn’t have much money. She didn’t dare to ask her mother and older brother for the money, because she didn’t tell them yet.

Her older brother spoiled her. So if he learned about it, he would surely go to kill Yuan Yiyang, but her older brother certainly wouldn’t succeed. What was worse, her older brother would be seriously punished, and she would be the cause if he was injured.

She was a lot more mature now, so she was unwilling to worry her family.

“Great, then you can donate one hundred thousand yuan to charity anonymously. When it’s done, I’ll arrange for people to teach those bad men a lesson for you. Well, it’s impossible to kill them, because I don’t want to be a murderer, but I’ll do an investigation. If they’ve committed other crimes and the crimes are serious, I will disable them and put them in jail. If not, I will only break their leg or arm. After all, they have no grudge against me, and I can’t do too much,” Gu Ning said. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Sure!” Qu Hanjiao was already satisfied that Gu Ning was willing to disable them and she didn’t dare to expect too much.

If she could collect more evidence of their crimes, she would be able to punish them more seriously according to the law, which would be a better result.

With Gu Ning’s answer, Qu Hanjiao left school at once to donate money to a charity. She wanted to finish that sooner, so that Gu Ning could help her take revenge earlier.

Thinking that Gu Ning didn’t take her money and instead made her do charity, Qu Hanjiao couldn’t help but feel ashamed.

Gu Ning was outstanding and had a strong sense of justice. Qu Hanjiao even antagonized her before, misunderstanding and slandering her. Upon thinking about it, Qu Hanjiao regretted acting against Gu Ning.

…

Once Qu Hanjiao was gone, Song Miaoge and the others came in a hurry and asked Gu Ning why Qu Hanjiao came to see her.

“She apologized to me for her bad behavior to me before, and she wants me to do her a favor,” said Gu Ning.

“What favor?” Song Miaoge asked curiously.

“It’s a secret.” Gu Ning didn’t tell them, because she thought that she shouldn’t tell other people about what Qu Hanjiao had been through.

Since Gu Ning didn’t want to tell them, they didn’t ask again, because Gu Ning would let them know if it was possible. If Gu Ning didn’t tell them, it meant they shouldn’t know.

When it was time for class, they went back to their own classrooms. At this time, Gu Ning called K and asked him to investigate Yuan Yiyang, Zhao Jie, and Wang Fei.

After the investigation, it turned out that they had done a lot of bad things and they didn’t even bother to hide it.

They might be too arrogant and believed that no one could punish them, or they were too confident and thought that nobody would find out what they had done. Either way, they weren’t smart.

What exactly had they done?

They hadn’t only raped Qu Hanjiao, they also raped several other girls, but those girls were all born in ordinary families, so they could do nothing about it.
