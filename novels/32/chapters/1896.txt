After the chart was handed over, there was a special staffer to check the information. The new member would only be officially accepted when the information was confirmed.

As Gu Ning and Nie Chenyang were exchanging numbers, Pan Tongyue left in silence.

In a while, the news that Gu Ning joined the Chamber of Commerce and that it was Nie Chenyang who invited her in person went abroad. Rong Zechen and Yuan Shuyan soon heard it.

Hearing the news about Gu Ning, Rong Zechen felt a little uncomfortable.

Rong Zechen originally planned to invite Gu Ning to join the secretariat so that he could have more time to spend with her.

However, after he was embarrassed by Gu Ning in public last time, he lost that hope. What was worse, he was even mad at Gu Ning, although he sometimes couldn’t help but think of her.

.

Perhaps he really liked Gu Ning now. Even though Gu Ning had embarrassed him and she already had a fiancé, he still couldn’t give her up right away.

Yuan Shuyan, however, hated Gu Ning more than ever, although what had happened last time was just a misunderstanding.

All of a sudden, Yuan Shuyan had an idea. Her younger female cousin was the vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, so she could ask her younger female cousin to help her make things difficult for Gu Ning. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

...

Qian Dongliang and his people were injured, but they did what Gu Ning told them to do. At 2 pm the next day, a new car of the same model as the one they had damaged showed up outside the headquarters of the Shengning Organization.

They actually didn’t dare to delay it, because they were afraid that Gu Ning might complain about them to Qi Tianlin.

However, they couldn’t disable Sun Xiangming so fast, because they were injured. Tian arranged for other people to deal with it, so it wasn’t something they could control now.

They only hoped that the task would be carried out within three days, otherwise they would be in danger.

The car which was damaged by Qian Dongliang and his people wasn’t totally ruined. It only had broken glass and a dented body, which was a bit more serious, but it would cost a lot of money to repair it. As a result, they chose to give it up.

After Qian Dongliang sent the car over, Chen Cangyi reported it to Gu Ning.

...

Gu Ning filled in the information that she needed to give the Chamber of Commerce quickly. The next day, on Thursday, Gu Ning took the materials to the office of the Chamber of Commerce during a break between classes, and nothing happened.

However, at noon that day, Gu Ning received a call from Cai Wenhong, the curator of the Palace Museum. He told her that the auction time had been set, and it would be on the 10th of next month. It was September 25, so there was still half a month left.

The deadline for registration of auction items was the end of this month, so Cai Wenhong told Gu Ning to check the auction items when she was free.

During registration, experts would personally inspect the goods. However, it was only the primary election, and there would be a re-election.

Because there were so many items to be auctioned, but the number of auction places was limited, not all applicants would be selected in the end. Therefore, after all the items were registered, a screening was required to select the most valuable items for auction.

Although Gu Ning had a lot of free time, she was worried that accidents might happen, so she planned to deal with it tomorrow afternoon, because tomorrow was Friday and she only had two classes in the afternoon. So she could leave the school at 4 pm.

After that, Gu Ning called Chen Darong again and told him that tomorrow afternoon the experts at the Palace Museum would look at auction items. She asked him if he had time. If he had, they could go together.

Chen Darong had waited for this day for a long time. Not to mention that he had time, even if he didn’t have time, he would do his best to spare some time without affecting his work.

Gu Ning then told Chen Darong the location, which was in her villa at Century City in the southern district.

There was a basement in her place. After tomorrow, she would take the bronze chimes out and put them in the basement.

After the call with Chen Darong, Gu Ning called Master Leng after thinking for a while.

“Hi, Ningning, it’s rare to hear from you! I thought you already forgot me!” Master Leng complained once he received Gu Ning’s call.

Hearing that, Gu Ning felt a little guilty and touched her nose. She indeed hadn’t called Master Leng for a long time. In fact, she seldom called the Tang family as well.

Thinking of that, she felt she wasn’t a good granddaughter or daughter.

Actually, when she got busy, she easily ignored her family. Even Leng Shaoting had to call her first most of the time.

“Sorry, Grandpa Leng, I’ve been very busy these days, so I forgot to call you.” Gu Ning apologized.

Master Leng understood that Gu Ning was very busy, so he didn’t blame her. “Did anyone dare to bully you on campus?” Master Leng asked.

“Don’t worry, Grandpa Leng, nobody dares to bully me. No matter who has that idea, he or she will learn a lesson,” said Gu Ning.

“Well, if any idiot dares to bully you with the influence of his or her family background, don’t hesitate to punch them. Grandpa will support you,” said Master Leng. He didn’t want Gu Ning to suffer anything unpleasant. Even though he was aware that Gu Ning wasn’t weak, as her family and an elder, he naturally supported her.

“Sure.” Gu Ning agreed. “Oh, Grandpa Leng, I actually called you today to talk about something with you.”

“What is it?” Master Leng asked at once, sounding a little nervous. He was worried that Gu Ning might be in trouble.

“Um, I have a set of bronze chimes. I plan to put it up for auction. Tomorrow afternoon, Curator Cai from the Palace Museum will bring experts to appraise them. Are you interested? If you are, why don’t you come with Grandpa Jiang and Grandpa Xu?” Gu Ning said. If she didn’t tell them right now, they would blame her for keeping it a secret.

“What? Bronze chimes? A set? Do you mean a whole set?”

Hearing that, Master Leng was shocked. A single bronze chime wasn’t something special, but a whole set of bronze chimes was quite amazing. In fact, even a group of it was very rare.

“Yeah, but I got them from an ancient grave. I know it’s illegal.” Gu Ning was honest. She told Master Leng that she didn’t get them from a legal source, because everyone would know they couldn’t be legal.

Saying that, Gu Ning was very nervous. After all, grave-digging wasn’t allowed, so she was afraid that Master Leng might have a bad impression of her.

Nevertheless, even if she didn’t tell him right now, he would learn about it at the auction. Gu Ning decided to put them up for auction under the name of Xiangyun Antique-store, which would bring great fame to Xiangyun.

Hearing that, Master Leng asked, “Do you want me to help you make it legal?” He said nothing about Gu Ning’s grave-digging. However, since the chimes weren’t legal, they could easily cause trouble.
