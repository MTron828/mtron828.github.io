Chapter 2565: There Are Always People Who Are Better than You

After Gu Ning destroyed the mutant, the two ninjas who were controlling it were totally shocked. They didn’t expect the mutant to be killed!

At the same time, they were in total despair. After the mutant was killed, they were doomed to fail.

Once Gu Ning killed the mutant, she quickly rushed to help Baili Zongxue. Although Baili Zongxue was fine, it was better if they finished the battle as soon as possible.

When Gu Ning came, Baili Zongxue realized that the mutant was already killed. However, “” she was aware of Gu Ning’s abilities, so she wasn’t too surprised.

After Gu Ning came over, she directly attacked the two ninjas.

Before long, the two ninjas were killed.

Although Gu Ning didn’t want to kill, they were a big threat to their country, so she had to get rid of them.

If they were just ordinary people, she would let them live, but they weren’t.

Ninjas from Country R were like professional killers. They had killed countless people and had done many bad deeds secretly. As a result, even though they were killed, Country R wouldn’t dare to have an open investigation.

Besides, they came with a mutant, which meant they didn’t get in legally. Without records of their entry and exit, the Ueno family couldn’t prove that they were killed by a foreigner.

Actually, even if they had these records, they didn’t have evidence.

Anyway, if ninjas dared to murder people in a foreign country, they shouldn’t be afraid of anything.

After that, Qi Tianlin decided to cause the Ueno family some trouble, so the Ueno family wouldn’t have time to investigate their death.

However, ninjas were rarer than cultivators, so they wouldn’t tolerate the loss. It was possible that they would try to pay Qi Tianlin back later.

It was very natural for them to want to take revenge, but they would also be afraid of suffering a loss again.

After killing the two ninjas, Gu Ning told Cheng Hua and Yu Hao to carry them into their car. Then she got them to leave first, and she would stay to deal with the rest.

Qi Tianlin wanted to stay with her, but Gu Ning told him to leave. Qi Tianlin had to listen to her so he told Gu Ning to contact him again after she was back in City Rui.

When Qi Tianlin and the others left, only Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue were left. Without delay, Gu Ning directly put the car with the two ninjas inside into her telepathic eye space.

Baili Zongxue understood that Gu Ning had a Qiankun Bag, so she wasn’t surprised.

They had to clean up the scene properly, or other people might find out sooner or later.

Afterwards, Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue rushed to the border of their country and Burma. They dumped the car in a river in the middle, so that no one would know where they had an accident.

After dealing with that, Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue went back to the city.

There were dozens of kilometers between the border and City Rui, but Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue quickly arrived using qinggong.

Although they had gotten rid of the mutant, they didn’t rush to go back the next day, because City Rui was the largest inland port in the southwest area of their country and was an important jewelry distribution center. City Rui was rich in jade resources, while City Teng was only a distribution center, so its resources weren’t as good.

When she learned that Jing Jining’s company was located in City Rui, she always wanted to come to have a look, but she didn’t have time.

So since she was here, she decided to come over and have a look to see whether she could expand her business to City Rui.

Gu Ning talked about that with Baili Zongxue, and Baili Zongxue didn’t mind. Anyway, she was happy to hang around for a few more days!

As soon as Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue arrived at the city center of City Rui, she called Qi Tianlin, but told him that she wouldn’t go to see him.

Qi Tianlin wanted to see Gu Ning, but he wouldn’t force her to come to see him.

…

Back in the city center, Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue stayed in a hotel, then Gu Ning started collecting information about jade raw material miners in City Rui.

In City Rui, there were three largest jade raw material miners. One of them was Jing Jining’s partner, Yutian Jade Mining Company.

This miner also had the best reputation in the industry.

As for the other two miners, one was average, while the other had a bad reputation.

However, that was just Internet users’ opinions, so she had to learn more about them by herself.

When it was almost 11 pm, Baili Zongxue wanted to go have delicious night snacks, so she said to Gu Ning, “Gu Ning, why don’t we go have some night snacks?”

“Sure!” Once Baili Zongxue mentioned that, Gu Ning felt hungry too, so she went to get food with Baili Zongxue. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

There was a food street near the hotel where they stayed. City Rui was a tourist city, so there were many specialties, so Baili Zongxue and Gu Ning went to eat at a store that had famous specialties, then began to order.

Both of them ate a lot, which attracted a lot of attention from people around them.

Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue didn’t bother to pay attention to them, and only enjoyed their food.

However, after looking at them for a while, two girls at another table began to talk about them.

“They eat so much!”

“Yeah, but they aren’t fat at all. I’m so jealous!”

“Right, they’re attractive, beautiful and white.”

“We’re barely comparable to them.”

The two girls discussed, but they had no negative comments about Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue, so Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue didn’t care about that. After all, the two girls were complimenting them.

However, several men at the other table were talking about them in dirty words.

“Oh, we rarely see such beautiful and sexy girls in City Rui. They must be tourists. Hey, why don’t we go talk with them?” A man said to his friends.

“Sure, which one of you will go first?”

“I’ll do it,” said a young good-looking man. Then he raised his glass and walked to the table where Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue sat.

While they spoke about them, Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue heard them, but they said nothing and just enjoyed their food.
