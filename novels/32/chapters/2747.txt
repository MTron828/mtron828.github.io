Chapter 2748: Do You Want to Be Put in Jail?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Saying that, Zheng Shenghui turned to glare at Kong Lixuan and angrily questioned. “Kong Lixuan, what do you want to do? Why did you hurl the blame at me? I’ve never treated you unfairly. Why do you have to frame me like this?”

Facing Zheng Shenghui’s glare, Kong Lixuan felt guilty, but he couldn’t change his confession now.

“Chairman Zheng, you threatened me with my family. You forced me to bribe workers from Shenghua Real Estate to replace their bricks with unqualified bricks. It wouldn’t do me any good. Why would I do that?” said Kong Lixuan in annoyance. Thinking of that, he felt very aggrieved.

“Do you have evidence to prove that I threatened you with your family and forced you to bribe workers from Shenghua Real Estate? If you don’t have evidence, it’s slander!” said Zheng Shenghui.

Because Lin Shiwei had a recording of his conversation with Kong Lixuan, Zheng Shenghui was afraid that Kong Lixuan might have done the same thing. Therefore, he didn’t have much confidence when he questioned Kong Lixuan.

“It was you! You were displeased when Shenghua Real Estate got the land you wanted, so you decided to scheme against them.” Kong Lixuan suddenly lost control of his emotions and roared. It was Zheng Shenghui’s order, so he was reluctant to carry all the blame.

Most importantly, he was forced to do that. If he was greedy and did it for money, he wouldn’t be as mad if Zheng Shenghui wanted to make him a scapegoat, but it wasn’t the truth. He was threatened and forced into doing that from the very beginning.

Therefore, even though he gave in, he was still mad at Zheng Shenghui. And now Zheng Shenghui placed the blame on him, filling him with anger and aggravation.

“What? I was displeased that Shenghua Real Estate took the land I wanted? That’s ridiculous. It’s very normal for peers to compete against each other. Whether I won or lost, it’s not uncommon. I have other choices as well. There is no need for me to do that. Stop slandering me. I thought it’s just a mistake you made. You’ve done a lot for Chengfeng, and I planned to share the responsibility with you, so that your family can pay less, but you don’t regret it at all and even want to drag me into trouble. It’s really heart-breaking…” said Zheng Shenghui, seeming really disappointed.

“Without your permission, how can I get four million yuan from the finance department?” Kong Lixuan argued.

“I’m about to investigate that! How did you get four million yuan from the finance department? Why did the manager agree to give it to you?” Zheng Shenghui asked angrily as if he was the victim.

“You…” Kong Lixuan was so mad that he suddenly didn’t know what to say. What Zheng Shenghui just said was complete nonsense.

“If so, tell the manager of the finance department of your company to come over,” said Gu Ning. She knew that Zheng Shenghui must have fully-prepared before he came. Even if the finance manager came, the man would only be another scapegoat.

Anyway, it was an insider, so he needed to come.

“Sure, let me call him right now.” Zheng Shenghui agreed with alacrity. Then he immediately took out his phone and called the manager of the finance department.

However, no one believed that he was innocent so it had to be his arrangement that he would call the manager of the finance department to come over.

Before the manager came, they had a while to rest.

About twenty minutes later, the manager of the finance department for Chengfeng Real Estate came and they returned to the interrogation room.

“Manager Wang, after our investigation, we found that Kong Lixuan took four million yuan out of the bank account of the finance department. Can you tell us what happened?” Upon seeing Manager Wang, Zheng Shenghui questioned him angrily.

Hearing that, Manager Wang was startled, then apologized. “I’m sorry, Chairman Zheng, I have a good relationship with Manager Kong. His friend’s kid has leukemia and he needed money, so I lent the money to him.”

“You’re lying!” Kong Lixuan argued emotionally.

“Manager Kong, you…” Manager Wang turned to look at Kong Lixuan resignedly. He wanted to say something, but didn’t finish.

“Do you need so much money for the medical treatment?” asked Gu Ning.

“No, but Manager Kong said he needed money for something else. He promised to pay me back at the end of this year, so I lent it to him,” said Manager Wang.

“Oh, aren’t there rules in Chengfeng Real Estate? Can the finance department lend four million yuan without anyone’s permission?” Gu Ning laughed at them. Obviously, she didn’t believe it. “Chairman Zheng, do you believe it? Do you think his words are persuasive? As a chairman of a large company, I don’t think you should believe such bullsh*t.”

Zheng Shenghui was extremely embarrassed. He knew that no one would believe it, but he didn’t know what else to do. He only needed a scapegoat, so he could get out of this mess.

“Chairman Gu, what’s your opinion then? Do you believe Kong Lixuan and think that I forced him to scheme against Shenghua Real Estate?” Zheng Shenghui angrily questioned. “If so, show me the evidence. As long as you have evidence, I won’t deny it again.”

“Kong Lixuan’s confession isn’t enough to prove that you forced him to scheme against Shenghua Real Estate, but Kong Lixuan has no motive to do that. Chairman Zheng, on the other hand, I think you have a strong motive. Manager Wang shouldn’t be dumb so he knows that he can’t give Kong Lixuan four million yuan without his leader’s permission. After all, it’s a crime to use public money without permission. I don’t think he wants to go to jail.” Gu Ning paused and turned to ask Manager Wang, “Manager Wang, do you want to go to jail?”

Hearing that, Manager Wang panicked. He obviously didn’t want to go to jail, but he couldn’t betray Zheng Shenghui. Therefore, he replied. “I’m not dumb and I don’t want to be put in jail. I’m just sympathetic. When Kong Lixuan encountered trouble, I didn’t think much and lent the money to him.”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
