Chapter 2472 Call the Police for Him

“Thanks.” The man felt Gu Ning’s kindness, so he thanked her although he still stayed alert.

Because of Gu Ning’s words, he gave up the idea of killing. Therefore, Gu Ning helped him out this time.

Although Gu Ning didn’t ask further, the man felt too aggrieved to say nothing, so he opened his mouth. “The girl is a liar. She’s been with me for three months. She borrowed two hundred thousand yuan from me, then she broke up with me. She refused to return the money to me. She even cut off her relationship with me and changed her number. I was so mad that I lost my reason. I was born in an ordinary family. Two hundred thousand yuan is a lot of money for me, especially since my father’s sick. We need the money for the operation.”

Saying that, the man felt like crying. He made a mistake and chose the wrong girl, but he was just being kind. He shouldn’t bear the tragic consequences.

Knowing that, Gu Ning frowned. It seemed that she guessed correctly. The girl indeed had done something unacceptable. “If so, why didn’t you call the police?” Gu Ning asked.

“I did, but even the police couldn’t find her. It took me a long time to finally find her. I asked her for the money, but she refused to pay me back. She insisted on saying that I gave the money to her of my own accord,” said the man. “Now you found her. Why didn’t you call the police? Why did you come up with the idea of killing her?” asked Gu Ning.

“I did, but the police said that I don’t have evidence to prove that I lent her the money. They can’t arrest her without proof, but I have the transaction record. I know the police just didn’t want to solve the problem for me, so I lost control of my emotions,” said the man, sounding very upset. Hearing that, Gu Ning was also displeased. Even though it was the reality and not every policeman was responsible, she still felt annoyed when it really happened.

“Is that true?” Gu Ning stared at his eyes. She wanted to know whether it was true from his reaction.

“Of course,” said the man sincerely, so Gu Ning decided to believe him for the time being.

“Alright, I can call the police for you. The police will solve your problem. Although you don’t have evidence, the transaction record can come to use. No one will transfer money to another person for no reason. It can be judged to be fraudulent,” said Gu Ning.

“Really?” The man was surprised.

“Will the police come?” Because the police refused to help him, the man wondered whether Gu Ning’s call could make a difference.

“Don’t worry, they’ll come, but you should promise to me that you didn’t lie,” said Gu Ning.

“I promise I didn’t lie. Miss, please help me call the police,” said the man seriously.

“Sure,” said Gu Ning, then she took out her phone to call Zhang Jingnan.

Due to He Yuanhao, Gu Ning remembered Zhang Jingnan’s number, but they didn’t exchange numbers. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Yeah, who’s that?” Zhang Jingnan asked.

“Hi, Deputy Director Zhang, this is Gu Ning, Shaoting’s fiancée.” Gu Ning introduced herself.

“Oh, Miss Gu, very nice to hear from you. Did something happen?” Zhang Jingnan immediately replied politely. “Um, here is the thing…” Gu Ning told Zhang Jingnan the man’s story. Zhang Jingnan was very mad when he heard that the police refused to help the man. He was responsible, so he couldn’t tolerate it, even though it had already become the norm.

As for the trouble the man ran into, it could be judged as fraud with the transaction record.

Anyway, they needed the man’s account.

“Miss Gu, don’t worry, just leave it to me. I’ll handle it in person. I’ll call the police station at the airport and get a man over right now. Miss Gu, if you don’t mind, I’ll give them your number so that you can help us confirm the person involved,” said Zhang Jingnan. “No problem,” said Gu Ning. Afterwards, they hung up. When the man heard how Gu Ning greeted the person at the other end of the phone, he was astonished. Although he didn’t know what deputy director it was, it must be a very important figure.

In that case, this girl before him must have a high status too.

“Alright, they’ll arrange for policemen to take you to the Public Security Bureau right now. You can go with them. I’m sure they’ll help you out, but that’s all I can do for you,” said Gu Ning. It was already very nice of her that she was willing to help him out. “Thank you, Miss Gu.” The man thanked Gu Ning. “Oh, what’s the girl’s name?” Gu Ning asked.

“Yang Meiqi,” said the man.

“And yours?”

“Zhang Yu.” The man answered.

“Great, you can wait here. I’ll go to see her. Don’t come over until the police arrive,” said Gu Ning

“Sure,” said the man. Then Gu Ning walked back to sit by the girl.

She wanted to make sure of the girl’s identity, so she deliberately struck up a conversation with her. “Hi, you look familiar. Have we met somewhere before?” Yang Meiqi turned to look at Gu Ning. She was stunned by her beauty and got jealous in an instant. However, she had no impression of Gu Ning. Gu Ning was too pretty to be forgotten, so she would remember her if they really had met before.

Anyway, because Gu Ning was a girl, Yang Meiqi didn’t get nervous. She thought that Gu Ning must have mistaken her for another person, so she replied in a flat voice. “I don’t think so.”

“Are you Yang Meiqi?” Gu Ning asked.

Hearing that, Yang Meiqi was surprised. It turned out that Gu Ning really knew her.

“I am. Who are you?” Yang Meiqi asked.

“Oh, so you’re Zhang Yu’s girlfriend, right?” Gu Ning continued.

Yang Meiqi was embarrassed, which made Gu Ning sure that she really wasn’t right.

“Um, I already broke up with him,” said Yang Meiqi.

“Fine!” Gu Ning said nothing further.

Because Gu Ning mentioned Zhang Yu, Yang Meiqi stopped asking who she was.
