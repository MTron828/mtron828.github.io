951 He Will Come

Gu Ning had kept her promise to the security guard, and he got double his previous salary from now on.

The security guard was very lucky to meet Gu Ning today, and easily got a promotion.

Some people felt regretful now. They wished that they had stood out to help Gu Ning just then. However, it was just a wish. None of them dared to act against Qiu Lili.

In that case, the security guard deserved better treatment.

He was very excited, and also felt grateful to Gu Ning. He accepted the offer, and made up his mind to do his job well as usual in the future. That was the only thing he could do to return Gu Ning’s kindness.

Two other vice leaders in the security guard team felt a little jealous after hearing the news, because they had worked hard for years to earn their current position. However, even though they were a little jealous, they didn’t dare to do anything about it. Only idiots would act against their chairman.

...

Gu Ning went back to the Tang family’s house, and dined with her family.

She wasn’t in a hurry to give Gu Man the set of jewelry, because she planned to present it on Gu Man’s wedding day.

Although Gu Man stayed in the Tang family’s house these days, she didn’t sleep in the same room as Tang Yunfan, and Tang Yunfan respected her decision. They would only chat with each other in the study before they went to bed in their own rooms.

However, Gu Man would go back to Huafu Hills today, and members of the Tang family would go to pick her up the day after tomorrow.

Gu Ning owned a house in Huafu Hills, and what was hers was also Gu Man’s.

Gu Qing’s and Gu Qinyang’s family would walk Gu Man to the wedding car on that day, which was a perfect plan.

Gu Man was very nervous because her wedding was around the corner now. She was even a little scared, and wanted to run away from it, but she wouldn’t do that. Tang Yunfan loved her deeply and she also ached to spend the rest of her life with him. In addition, she also hoped to give Gu Ning an intact family. A biological father was always better than a step-father after all.

“Ningning, will Shaoting come?” Tang Haifeng asked Gu Ning. Gu Ning’s parents were Leng Shaoting’s future parents-in-law after all. Even though they were just girlfriend and boyfriend now, the Tang family already took Leng Shaoting as family.

Nevertheless, they also knew that Leng Shaoting’s job was very special, and that it wasn’t up to him to leave the military base.

“He’ll come if he’s free,” Gu Ning said.

...

When it was 1 pm, Gu Ning drove Gu Man to the airport to pick up their relatives.

Gu Ning’s car couldn’t accommodate all of them, so the Tang family sent an MPV to follow her.

Gu Qing’s family would arrive at 2:10 pm, and Gu Qinyang’s family would arrive at 2:30 pm. Gu Ning planned it so that she could pick them up together.

When Gu Ning and the others reached the airport, it was still 20 minutes away from their arrival time.

At 2:12 pm, Gu Qing called Gu Man and told her that they had arrived.

A while later, Gu Qing’s family of three showed up. They didn’t bring many things with them, so there was no need for them to collect luggage.

Once they walked out, they saw Gu Ning and Gu Man, then strode towards them with excitement.

“Man, Ningning!” Gu Qing greeted them.

“Hi, Man, Ningning!” Jiang Xu said with a broad smile.

“Nice to see you, Aunt Man, Ningning!” Jiang Xinyue was very polite, but was more outgoing than before.

“Welcome!”

“Welcome to City B!”

Gu Man and Gu Ning greeted them too.

“Let’s have a seat somewhere. Qinyang’s family will arrive in 20 minutes,” Gu Man said.

“Sure.”

They walked to the seats together.

After they were all seated, Gu Qing and Gu Man began to chat with each other. Gu Ning also asked Jiang Xu about his business.

Jiang Xu couldn’t be more satisfied with his business right now. “It’s going very well! Thank you so much for your help, Ningning. Most of my clients came to me because of you, but because I provide them with quality goods and services, they’re willing to continue cooperating with me.”

“Glad to know that.” Gu Ning felt happy for her uncle. She had helped her uncle make many deals, but it still depended on the quality of goods and services her uncle could provide.

“Ningning, um, I helped your eldest uncle without your permission. Are you annoyed at me?” Jiang Xu asked, feeling a little uneasy.

Although Gu Qing had already told Gu Man, and Gu Man must have told Gu Ning too, he still needed to talk about it with Gu Ning face to face. Gu Man didn’t blame them, but he still felt slightly guilty.

Gu Qinxiang’s family had treated Gu Man and Gu Ning so badly before. If he helped Gu Qinxiang, it seemed like he was siding with him against Gu Ning.

However, he and Gu Qinxiang were relatives after all, and he didn’t have the heart to see Gu Qinxiang’s family being doomed to fail.

“Not at all. I won’t help him, but I won’t stop you from doing it, because he has hurt me and my mother, not your family,” Gu Ning said. She was a very considerate girl.
