1149 Someone Stalks Gao Yi and Qiao Ya

Some people even mentioned(@) the official Weibo account of Fenghua Entertainment and Gu Ning to ask them for the reason.

Before Gu Ning could read the post, Lu Zhan and Su Tongnuo already made a reply.

Lu Zhan: We only choose the most suitable actresses for the roles.

After that, he also posted some cast photos of Tang Xiaoxiao, Bai Lin, Su Tongnuo, and Han Lengxuan.

Su Tongnuo: I love my role!

She also posted an official photo of her in the TV series. She was wearing a set of military uniform and looked very handsome in it.

Because this novel had been serialized on the Internet before, many of Duan Lixin’s fans had read it. In the cast photos, every actor suited their role well, and people were impressed by their new images.

In that case, no one continued to argue over Bai Lin and Su Tongnuo’s roles. They all couldn’t wait to see the show.

Haters, however, still kept attacking the show, saying that they weren’t interested in it at all. Some of them also criticized Fenghua Entertainment, because they didn’t think that a newly-established company was able to produce a TV series on its own.

They thought that it was unnecessary to publicize the new show before it was aired on TV. They simply disliked Fenghua and seized every chance to attack it.

Some also criticized Gu Ning saying that she was still a student and that she should focus on her studies instead of the business. They were purely jealous of Gu Ning.

Other entertainment companies in the industry hired some Internet Water Army to attack Fenghua Entertainment too.

...

Gu Ning wasn’t annoyed when reading these comments, because she was confident about the quality of the new show. In addition, Gu Ning had many loyal fans, and her fans along with countless fans of other actors teamed up together to argue against the haters on the Internet.

After this drama, the first show of Fenghua Entertainment became the hottest topic on Weibo, which was free advertisement for Fenghua.

...

About 20 minutes later, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya got off the plane, and Qiao Ya sent a message to Gu Ning at once.

Qiao Ya: Boss, we just noticed that someone is stalking us, and the person seems to be a killer too. What should we do now?

Gu Ning read Qiao Ya’s message and subconsciously thought that the person might want to murder Gao Yi and Qiao Ya.

Although Gao Yi’s and Qiao Ya’s names were already removed from the wanted list in the killers’ world, it didn’t mean that the killer organization that they had worked for before wouldn’t take action. In other words, their lives were still in danger.

Those who joined all kinds of killer organizations normally didn’t do it voluntarily, but were forced to receive the training. Some of them ached to leave, but only few of them were lucky enough to get rid of those killer organizations.

Anyway, Gu Ning should meet them right away.

Gu Ning: We can talk about it later when we meet.

Gu Ning understood that they were worried about her reputation, or they could have killed the person in a secret place. Gao Yi and Qiao Ya used to be professional killers after all, and it wasn’t difficult for them to do that.

Around 10 minutes later, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya appeared in Gu Ning’s sight, and Gu Ning also noticed a man about 30 years old, not too far behind them. The man indeed had the air of a killer.

Killers grew up in a very different environment from ordinary people, so they had a different air too. They were trained as killing machines ever since they were very young, so most of them were cold-blooded.

Even though Gao Yi and Qiao Ya had stayed beside Gu Ning for a long time, they normally still looked very cold.

Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl, so she could easily tell the difference between a killer and a normal man.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya sped up and walked towards Gu Ning once they saw her.

Gu Ning, however, saw an unkind expression on the man behind them, so she was even more sure that the man aimed to hurt Gao Yi and Qiao Ya.

Without hesitation, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to scan the man’s body to see whether he was carrying any guns.

Although it was forbidden to take guns aboard planes, people who had a firearms license could do it.

In most cases, soldiers could have the firearms license, but it didn’t mean that other people couldn’t. For example, Gu Ning had a firearms license herself.

If a person who wasn’t a soldier had a firearms license, he had to have powerful connections to help him get it.

Fortunately, the man didn’t have guns.

In fact, even if he had guns, Gu Ning wasn’t afraid of it, because she would be well-prepared since she already found out.

Gao Yi, Qiao Ya, and Gu Ning then left together and they seemed to be calm. They got in a car and left the airport at once, followed by the man. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Gu Ning definitely noticed that, but she had no intention to get rid of him right now. They planned to drive to a place where nobody was around to deal with him.
