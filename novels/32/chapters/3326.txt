3327 It’s Meaningless No Matter How Good She Is

“That’s too formal. After the National College Entrance Examination, I’m going to the capital city. If my family needs any help in the future, I’ll have to rely on you!” said Leng Xiaoyao, without any hesitation.

“Of course, just let us know if you need anything. No need to hesitate.” replied Mrs. An. The An family owed Leng Xiaoyao, and they genuinely liked her.

“Where is Uncle An?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“He’s at the company,” said Mrs. An.

“I came here today because of the car accident that Brother Chenjun was in. Chenmeng told me that you suspected that it might be a conspiracy. Have you found out who the mastermind is?” Leng Xiaoyao didn’t immediately present the evidence, but asked first. If they had already found out, presenting the evidence would seem presumptuous and rude.

Mrs. An and An Chenjun were a little surprised. They realized that An Chenmeng had told Leng Xiaoyao about their suspicion that it was a conspiracy. Although they felt it was inappropriate, they weren’t angry.

“We suspect it’s a conspiracy, but we haven’t found any evidence yet. We only feel that it’s a likely possibility,” said An Chenjun. He was frustrated and helpless when he thought about it.

Even if it was really a conspiracy, it would be difficult to bring the real mastermind to justice.

“Do you have any suspects?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“We suspect Chen Yihai, the chairman of Lufeng Group because we had some competition in business recently and it caused quite a stir,” said An Chenjun.

“I actually investigated it earlier, and I found out that the mastermind behind this isn’t Chen Yihai but Chen Yijiang,” said Leng Xiaoyao. This was another conspiracy to frame someone!

“What?”

An Chenjun and Mrs. An were both surprised that Leng Xiaoyao had found that out.

They suspected that it was related to the Lufeng Group, but couldn’t believe that it was Chen Yijiang instead of Chen Yihai.

After all, they had conflicts with Chen Yihai.

“A few days ago, Ling Tianqi was in trouble. The person who caused the trouble claimed to be Qin Wentao. It’s no secret that Ling Tianqi and Qin Wentao have some grudges. At the time, we thought it was Qin Wentao, but after investigating, it turned out to be Qin Wenming. Qin Wenming used Qin Wentao’s grudge with Ling Tianqi to frame Qin Wentao.” Leng Xiaoyao explained. She felt that telling An Chenjun about Ling Tianqi’s experience wouldn’t cause any harm. She only mentioned it to explain why it was Chen Yijiang instead of Chen Yihai. They were both similar in nature.

After hearing that, An Chenjun and Mrs. An understood the conspiracy behind it.

An Chenjun then eagerly asked, “You said you found out who the mastermind is. Do you have any evidence?”

Leng Xiaoyao directly showed them the evidence she had found after investigating.

After reading the evidence, it was confirmed that the mastermind behind the scenes was indeed Chen Yijiang.

“So, Chen Yijiang wanted to frame Chen Yihai. He deliberately wanted to make me deal with Chen Yihai. Then Chen Yijiang could reap the benefits. What a good plan! If it weren’t for Xiaoyao, we would really have fallen for it,” Mrs. An said.

“Call my dad first, then we’ll see how to handle this,” An Chenjun said.

“Okay, I’ll call your dad right away.” Mrs. An said and immediately called An Weiping.

After receiving the evidence, An Weiping rushed over, asking Mrs. An to keep Leng Xiaoyao with them.

Upon arrival, An Weiping thanked Leng Xiaoyao for the talismans and for investigating and finding the evidence.

As for what to do with the evidence?

“Since the evidence is conclusive, we need to hand it over to the police,” An Weiping said.

Given the An Family’s status, the police wouldn’t dare to neglect them.

After the police received the evidence, they immediately took action. Soon after, Chen Yijiang was arrested at the company. He had no time to figure it out. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In fact, Chen Yijiang was waiting to see the drama, but unexpectedly he was exposed.

He failed to frame Chen Yihai and was even arrested in the end, which filled him with anger.

When Chen Yihai heard that Chen Yijiang was trying to harm An Chenjun, he knew that Chen Yijiang was trying to frame him.

Although he did have conflicts with the An Family in business, he wasn’t foolish enough to go against them because he knew that the Chen family was no match for the An family.

He wouldn’t do that just for a project, even though he had had the thought.

Since Chen Yijiang wanted to frame him, he had to add fuel to the fire. He couldn’t let Chen Yijiang have any chance of turning things around.

Although they were half-brothers, they had a bad relationship. Honestly, they were like enemies, otherwise Chen Yijiang wouldn’t do something to frame Chen Yihai.

Chen Yihai already had something on Chen Yijiang, but it wasn’t serious. If only these reports were used, it wouldn’t be possible to convict Chen Yijiang for too long.

If it weren’t for the murder charge against Chen Yijiang, Chen Yihai wouldn’t have been able to bring up any serious accusations against him.

…

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t pay attention to what happened afterwards and continued with her classes and reviews.

These days, Leng Changyuan was going out and meeting his old friends, boasting about his granddaughter and making his friends jealous.

“So what if she’s amazing? She’ll still get married and become part of someone else’s family,” one person said with jealousy.

Leng Changyuan was mad and displeased. “So? Even if she gets married, she’s still my granddaughter. She’ll still be filial to her grandpa.”

“But you’ll still be at the back of the line. Which woman doesn’t prioritize her husband’s family after getting married?” The person persisted.

“Zhang, that’s enough,”

Someone else couldn’t stand it and interrupted.

“I didn’t say anything wrong,” Zhang grumbled.

“Your daughter may prioritize her husband’s family, but other daughters may not be the same. My daughter is very filial. She often buys things and gives me pocket money. She visits me frequently too.”

Elder Zhang had two daughters and no son. After they got married, they rarely visited their parents and always prioritized their husbands’ families. As a result, only the two elderly parents were left at home.
