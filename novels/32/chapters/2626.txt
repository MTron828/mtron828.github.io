Chapter 2628: Go Back Together

Gu Ning didn’t think much about it. She helped Leng Shaoting take the Recovery Pill first, then directly put magical power into his body.

Because Leng Shaoting was seriously injured and dying, he needed a lot of magical power. After Gu Ning put her magical power into his body for a long while, he still had no reaction.

Five minutes later, Leng Shaoting’s fingers finally moved so Gu Ning felt a little relieved.

Jing Yunyao and Shangguan Yang, who were standing below, were also very worried about them, but they couldn’t do anything for the time being, so they could only watch.

If Gu Ning wasn’t here, they would still be able to cure Leng Shaoting, but it would take a lot more time.

Since Gu Ning was helping, Leng Shaoting would recover much faster.

After half an hour, Gu Ning became very weak, but luckily Leng Shaoting was much better. His face turned ruddy and he began to breathe steadily. Even his eyelids moved a little, but he still couldn’t open his eyes.

At that moment, Leng Shaoting was still unconscious. He felt as if he was awake, but also felt as if he was in a dream. His body was very heavy and he couldn’t get rid of the tiredness, but Leng Shaoting was determined. Finally he opened his eyes after fighting for several minutes, then he saw Gu Ning.

When he saw her, he couldn’t tell if it was reality or a dream, but he was happy. Whether it was reality or a dream, he was happy to see her.

Gu Ning stopped giving Leng Shaoting magical power after he opened his eyes. By now she was out of strength and could barely stand up. She softly sank into Leng Shaoting’s arms.

Although Leng Shaoting was awake now, only his injuries healed a lot; he was still very weak.

He wanted to support Gu Ning when she fell, but he was unable to. Luckily, he could move, so he hugged her when she collapsed into his arms.

…

When Gu Ning collapsed, Jing Yunyao and Shangguan Yang were scared, but they could see that she was fine. She was merely tired.

Seeing Leng Shaoting’s actions, Jing Yunyao and Shangguan Yang were excited and felt relieved.

“Ningning, a-am I in a dream?” Leng Shaoting asked in a hoarse voice.

“No, you’re not in a dream. It’s real…” Even though Gu Ning was weak, she was still conscious, so she could talk. She only sounded a little weaker.

Leng Shaoting summoned up his strength and hugged Gu Ning tightly. He needed to hold her to make sure it was real. “Oh, it’s real. It’s so wonderful!”

Gu Ning didn’t see the tears rolling down Leng Shaoting’s eyes. He was ecstatic after surviving the attack.

“Have some sleep!” said Leng Shaoting. He knew that Gu Ning had put a lot of magical power into his body. She was exhausted and his heart ached for her.

“Sure.” Gu Ning was indeed exhausted, so she really wanted to have some sleep. She had no energy to pay attention to Jing Yunyao and Shangguan Yang as she fell into a deep sleep.

Jing Yunyao and Shangguan Yang didn’t care. Gu Ning was extremely tired, so they would allow her to have a rest.

Leng Shaoting understood that both Jing Yunyao and Shangguan Yang were present, so he looked down and gave them a smile after Gu Ning fell asleep. He wanted them to know that he was fine.

Jing Yunyao almost cried. Her son survived! She thought she was going to lose him!

After that, Jing Yunyao and Shangguan Yang waited patiently. They would go after Gu Ning woke up.

“Wow, your master’s fiancée is amazing! She cured him within such a short time,” said the white flood dragon in amazement.

“Sure, why do you think I would listen to her? All of them are very strong, but my master ran into an extremely aggressive evil cultivator this time, so he got hurt,” said the flood dragon.

“Will you leave right after your master recovers?” asked the white flood dragon. It was reluctant for them to leave.

If Leng Shaoting got better, they would go back home. They didn’t belong to this ocean. What could they do here?

“Of course!” said the flood dragon.

“Can I go with you? I feel lonely when I’m alone deep in the ocean. No one talks to me. Other creatures are scared of me. If I can join you, you can stay by my side!” said the white flood dragon, looking pitiful.

“Sure, then we can go together! You can stay by Ningning’s side in the future.” Before the flood dragon said anything, Shangguan Yang replied. They would be less worried if Gu Ning could have a helper.

Although Gu Ning already had a monster fox and tree vine which had their own advantages, it would be better if Gu Ning had extra help.

“Really? Thank you so much!” The white flood dragon danced in excitement. It didn’t want to be alone any longer.

…

Gu Ning didn’t wake up until two hours later. After she woke up, she realized that she kept Shangguan Yang and Jing Yunyao waiting for her. She was a little embarrassed, but she was indeed too tired earlier.

After sleeping for two hours, Gu Ning regained much of her strength, while Leng Shaoting was only a bit more energetic. Gu Ning had only lost some strength and could quickly regain it, but Leng Shaoting was seriously injured, so it would be slow for him to recover.

Gu Ning lowered the barrier with her magical energy. After they touched the ground, Shangguan Yang walked over and connected the two barriers again. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting finally met up with them.

Because both Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were very weak, Shangguan Yang took care of Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao looked after Gu Ning. They flew back on two flying swords, because a single sword could only accommodate three people on it. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Shangguan Yang also told Gu Ning that the white flood dragon wanted to leave with them. He thought it was a good idea, so he agreed. He planned to let the white flood dragon follow Gu Ning.

Gu Ning accepted it. In fact, she had the same idea, but she cared too much about Leng Shaoting earlier, so she didn’t think further about it.

She turned to look at the white flood dragon and said, “Let me be honest with you, if you leave with us, you’ll stay by my side. I’ll be your master. You will need to serve me. I won’t enslave you or treat you badly. On the contrary, I can help you with your cultivation.”
