Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Most people already had a good impression of Gu Ning, and her behavior impressed them deeper this time.

Reporters then began to ask her questions about her companies, and she replied to them with patience, which helped her gain more fans.

While Gu Ning was being interviewed, Qin Zheng and his friends came. They noticed the banner hanging at the gate, and felt embarrassed, so without delay, they quickly walked away in the crowd.

Chu Peihan and the others arrived later, and all felt honored for being Gu Ning’s friends.

“Our boss is too noticeable to be ignored!” Hao Ran said with great pride.

“Yeah, but it’s stressful sometimes, especially when Ningning doesn’t want to attract too much attention,” Chu Peihan said.

“She’s at the same age as us, but I always feel that she’s much more mature than us,” Qin Zixun said.

“If she wasn’t much more mature than her peers, she wouldn’t have what she has achieved today!” Mu Ke said.

“...”

They admired Gu Ning and regarded her as their idol, but they weren’t jealous of her because they treated her with sincerity.

After a long while, Gu Ning stopped the interview and walked into the school, and Hao Ran and the others caught up to her at once.

Along the way, they were the focus of other students’ attention. When they entered the teaching building, they went to their own classrooms.

Gu Ning’s classmates kept on complimenting her once she showed up, and they also congratulated her on her exam result. None of them were jealous of her either, because they knew that Gu Ning was a hard act to follow.

Their head teacher came later, and congratulated Gu Ning first before she started the meeting.

The meeting aimed to give them advice about their application for universities. They could apply for their dream universities from today.

Halfway through the meeting, the dean of students showed up and he came to tell Gu Ning to go to the Academic affairs office in person.

Gu Ning followed him, leaving many of her classmates curious about the reason why Gu Ning had to leave all of a sudden. They thought that something terrible might have happened.

Thinking of that, they began to be worried about Gu Ning. Only Zhang Qiuhua knew the real reason. The principal just told her that some people from prestigious universities around the country wanted to see Gu Ning today.

Although the principal knew that Gu Ning was determined to study in the Capital University, he couldn’t stop the leaders of other colleges from coming. Gu Ning had now become the student that most of the famous universities wanted. Given her total score, she was sure to be enrolled in the best universities in their country.

The principal felt really proud of her. Because of Gu Ning, their school had gained much fame.

The dean of students led Gu Ning to the principal’s office instead of the Academic affairs office.

Gu Ning wasn’t surprised at all, because she knew that she was very popular now. She had a full score of 750 points after all, and no one else could have a higher score than her.

When Gu Ning walked into the office, there were six people sitting inside.

Once she appeared, they all stood up to introduce themselves to Gu Ning. Some of them represented great universities in City B, while some came from the capital.

Although they were willing to provide Gu Ning with attractive treatments, Gu Ning turned them down calmly.

She told them that her dream university was the Capital University, and its representative stepped out at once. He introduced himself to Gu Ning first, then offered her the same treatment.

Although there was no difference among the treatments they offered to Gu Ning, Gu Ning still chose the Capital University. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The other representatives felt disappointed, but they had to accept this result. The Capital University was the top university in their country after all.

Although Gu Ning agreed, the representative of the Capital University still signed a written agreement with her and handed her the acceptance letter right away.

After it was settled, they would talk with the Education Bureau to confirm Gu Ning’s choice of university. As long as Gu Ning studied in the Capital University, she could major in any major she wanted to.

Cai Qinghua was more than happy to hear the good news, although he still felt a little sad after he lost that calligraphy. Anyway, Master Leng already had that calligraphy and it was useless for him to be regretful now.

...

By the time Gu Ning left the office, the students meeting was also over, and her classmates gathered together at the gate, waiting for her.

Their head teacher had explained the real reason why the dean of students wanted to see Gu Ning to them, so they understood that it wasn’t a bad thing. At the same time, they admired Gu Ning more than ever.

Gu Ning then shared the good news with them that she already signed an agreement with the Capital University.

Her classmates all felt happy for her. Since Gu Ning was already enrolled by the top university in their country, they all asked her to celebrate with them.

Gu Ning smiled and agreed to have a meal together and said that she would pay the bill. In fact, even if there was no good news, she would still be willing to share a meal with them.

Because it wasn’t time for dinner yet, they found a good place to enjoy some snacks.

...

Representatives of other famous universities also wanted to meet Gu Ning, but the principal directly rejected it, because Gu Ning had already signed an agreement with the Capital University.

The Capital University was undoubtedly the best choice a senior high student could have, so they didn’t complain. The other top university in their country heard the news later, and felt upset. However, there was nothing it could do now.
