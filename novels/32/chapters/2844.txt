After Pei Jiangchao was taken away, his colleague called the Pei family at once. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

When Master Pei heard the news, he almost passed out in anger.

He couldn’t believe that Zheng Zhuoming had the voice recording of their conversation in the study.

In that case, he and Pei Jianghai would be dragged into trouble too, because they tried to shelter Pei Jiangchao and even planned to make someone the scapegoat.

However, how did Zheng Zhuoming get the voice recording?

The first idea that appeared in his mind was that there was an undercover agent in the Pei family. The Pei family had tight security, and it wasn’t easy for outsiders to get in, but if the person was very skilled, it was possible that he could avoid being caught.

Anyway, he needed to investigate to figure it out.

After Master Pei hung up, he had no time to carefully think about it. Without delay, he called the butler over to see who had come in and gone out of the study these days. When they were in the study yesterday, who was outside?

Because the Pei family’s house was very large, there were surveillance cameras in public parts of the mansion in case any accidents happened.

However, after investigation, only Master Pei and the butler had entered the study alone.

Master Pei didn’t ask a maid to clean the study, but the butler would do the work. Only the butler had Master Pei’s complete trust, so he wouldn’t doubt the butler’s loyalty.

Other people, including his biological sons, namely Pei Jiangchao and Pei Jianghai, couldn’t go in the study without his permission, but Master Pei wouldn’t be suspicious of them either.

The surveillance cameras outside the study were somehow broken at the time when they were in the study, so they found nothing.

In that case, the truth couldn’t be more obvious. The person must have recorded their conversation outside the study after damaging the surveillance cameras, but how did the person do that?

They were on the second floor. If the person needed to record their conversation, he must have climbed up to the window.

No matter what, what they found was enough to prove that the person damaged the surveillance cameras before recording their conversation by the window.

Although the surveillance cameras outside the study were broken, the surveillance cameras at other places were fine. Therefore, they watched the surveillance videos of other parts to see whether they could get any clues.

Because they hadn’t found out who recorded their conversation yet, all the domestic servants were under suspicion.

Unfortunately, their conversation was already exposed and the Pei family was in serious trouble now.

Master Pei was heavily hit and didn’t know what to do at this moment. It wasn’t just Pei Jiangchao; he and Pei Jianghai were also dragged into trouble.

If they didn’t know it was Pei Jiangchao who abducted Dai Xiongyu and hadn’t told Pei Jiangchao to make someone the scapegoat, he and Pei Jianghai would not be pulled into the trouble, but before their conversation was exposed, they couldn’t watch Pei Jiangchao ending up in jail. Anyway, Master Pei regretted being involved in this mess after it was exposed.

If they didn’t know what Pei Jiangchao had done and hadn’t sheltered him, only Pei Jiangchao would be in trouble now.

They weren’t cold-blooded, it was Pei Jiangchao’s actions yet they were dragged into trouble, which could ruin the whole Pei family.

Actually, they had just sheltered Pei Jiangchao and Dai Xiongyu wasn’t seriously injured, so Pei Jiangchao wouldn’t receive a serious punishment and they would be lightly punished too, but they would be put in jail for at least half a year or a whole year!

If he and Pei Jianghai were put in jail for a long time, the Pei family could easily lose everything.

However, if the Dai family was willing to settle it out of court, they would only need to pay some money to solve the problem.

However, only he and Pei Jianghai could get away with it, because they only sheltered Pei Jiangchao. If the Dai family was willing to settle it out of court, they would be fine, but Pei Jiangchao wouldn’t. After all, he had committed a serious crime.

He didn’t injure Dai Xiongyu, so he wouldn’t be punished too seriously, but he would be put in jail for two or three years.

Unfortunately, the Dai family couldn’t wait to unseat the Pei family. It was impossible for the Dai family to choose to settle it out of court.

However, even though Master Pei understood that it was impossible, he had to try it. If he tried, there was hope. If he didn’t, he would end up in despair.

Shortly after Master Pei heard the news, Pei Jianghai learned about it too. He couldn’t believe it either and immediately called Master Pei.

“Dad, do you know that Jiangchao was taken away by the police?” asked Pei Jianghai.

“Yeah, I know,” Master Pei said in a deep voice.

“How did they get the recording? Is there an undercover agent in our family? Have you investigated?” Pei Jianghai asked again.

“I did, but I can’t find the person…” Master Pei was very honest with Pei Jianghai.

“What? The surveillance cameras are broken? Does it have something to do with the staff in the monitor room?” asked Pei Jianghai.

“No, because the surveillance cameras in the monitor room are working properly. No one has damaged them,” said Master Pei.

“Then how were the surveillance cameras broken outside the study? Do we have video of before they were damaged?” Pei Jianghai asked, feeling that it was very strange.

Hearing that, Master Pei realized that they could have caught the person damaging the surveillance cameras, but they hadn’t! The surveillance cameras suddenly broke for no reason.

They still couldn’t find out why the surveillance cameras were broken.

“No, we don’t. We have to conduct a further investigation. I think we can talk about the voice recording with the Dai family in private to see whether they’re willing to settle it out of court. We can’t all end up in jail at the same time. If we’re arrested too, our family will collapse,” said Master Pei. He only wanted to protect himself and Pei Jianghai from being arrested right now. If he tried to help Pei Jiangchao get away with it, the Dai family might be angered.

“Can we turn to the Yuan family for help?” asked Pei Jianghai. He felt it would be unrealistic if they wanted to settle it out of court, but if there was no other choice, he had to agree to that.

“The Yuan family is in a mess now. They can’t help us, but I’ll call Master Yuan to see what they can do. If they refuse to help us, we have to rely on ourselves,” said Master Pei.

Pei Jianghai nodded, then said nothing further.

After hanging up, Master Pei called Master Yuan at once, but Master Yuan didn’t answer his call.
