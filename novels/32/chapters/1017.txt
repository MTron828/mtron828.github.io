Chapter 1020 Take with Mu Ye

“Once Infinite Horror became a success, many film teams asked me who edited it. It’s obvious that they want to poach Director Mu. I didn’t tell them. I’m not dumb!” Lu Zhan said.

Lu Zhan said that in order to remind Mu Ye that many people were trying to poach him.

K understood, but he wouldn’t leave Gu Ning’s company.

“Don’t worry, I won’t leave our team for money,” K said with a serious face.

K didn’t lack money, nor did he care much about money. Gu Ning had cured his legs after all, and he was always grateful to her.

Lu Zhan felt relieved knowing that K wouldn’t leave them for money.

Gu Ning was confident that K wouldn’t leave her company for money, because she could offer him whatever he wanted. He had freedom and enough funds to do whatever he wanted to do in Gu Ning’s company.

Take the game company as an example, Gu Ning went to register a game company just because K wanted to release a game.

She trusted him. Even if it failed and wasn’t profitable, she could still afford the result.

However, K wouldn’t have that unconditional support in other companies. Businessmen valued profits above anything else, and many of them were unwilling to take risks.

It was also the reason why so many companies made slow progress over a long time.

“Will Director Mu be in charge of the editing of all the films and TV shows produced by Fenghua Entertainment in the future?” Lu Zhan asked with anticipation.

Ever since Lu Zhan found out about K’s outstanding skills of editing, he lost interest in other post-production teams. However, it was up to K and Gu Ning to make the decision.

“No problem, but I can only do it when I’m not occupied by my own work,” K said with alacrity.

It was easy for him to edit a film, and there would only be one or two films within a year. In addition, Fenghua was also owned by Gu Ning.

“Oh, do you have other friends who work in this industry as well?” Gu Ning asked K all of a sudden. She had an idea to hire more skilled people.

K understood Gu Ning’s aim and said, “I know many people in this industry, but they aren’t my friends. If you need, I can call them.”

“Thanks, but don’t force them to work for me,” Gu Ning said. She indeed needed skilled workers, but she wouldn’t force them to work for her.

“I understand,” K said.

“Boss, I’m going to work on the script for Duan Lixin’s palace novel, and I think that Tang Xiaoxiao can be the leading actress. She’s an A-list good actress. Su Tongnuo should be in the show too, there is a role of a female general which is very suitable for her. I’ve talked with Tongnuo, and she did a good audition, so she got the role. As for the rest of the roles, they’re open for competition. I’ll send an invitation letter to audition to Han Lengxuan and Bai Lin too,” Lu Zhan said.

Lu Zhan was aware that Han Lengxuan and Bai Lin planned to join Fenghua Entertainment in the future.

Gu Ning also agreed to hire them, and Lu Zhan thought that they were good actors too. They just needed suitable roles to gain more fame. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“You can make decisions. I trust you,” Gu Ning said.

“Thanks, I won’t disappoint you,” Lu Zhan said with confidence.

After the great success of their first film, Lu Zhan was full of hope.

At this time Chen Cangyi said, “Boss, the construction of the headquarters is mostly done, and it has been aired for a week now, so it’s ready for us to work there.”

Ever since Chen Cangyi took charge of the construction project, they hired more people to speed it up, and finished it within three months.

The building had 18 stories in all, which was a complicated project. For now, 80% of it was done, and it had been aired for a week.

“Great, you’ll be responsible for that,” Gu Ning said.

“No problem,” Chen Cangyi said.

...

After lunch, Gu Ning planned to take some antiques to Xiangyun Antique-store at the antique street.

“Boss, let me drive you there!” K said.

“It’s fine. I’ll go to the headquarters with you first, then I’ll drive there myself,” Gu Ning said. If K went there with her, it wouldn’t be convenient for her to take out antiques from the telepathic eye space.

“Sure,” K said.

After that, they went back to the headquarters together. However, Mu Xuxin stopped K in the hall of the restaurant.

“Hi, Miss Gu, can I talk privately with Mu Ye for a while?” Mu Xuxin asked Gu Ning.

Since Gu Ning was Mu Ye’s boss, he should ask for Gu Ning’s permission. To his surprise, before Gu Ning could say anything, K interrupted them. “I don’t think it’s necessary.”
