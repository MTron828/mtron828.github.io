2952 Completely Unacceptable

She had no intention of hiding her change.

“You seem totally different today,” Leng Yecheng said.

“Am I more impressive today?” Leng Xiaoyao asked narcissistically, but it was the truth.

“Yeah, but I wonder how long it can last. Will you go back to who you were after today?” Leng Yecheng asked. He admitted that he still had worries. After all, Leng Xiaoyao was much more confident and impressive than before. For example, when she argued with Leng Yehua and humiliated Leng Yuqi and Chu Jianan earlier, it was very exciting.

“Don’t be a jinx!” Leng Changyuan grabbed a cushion from the sofa and hit Leng Yecheng. He didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to return to who she were before.

Whatever Leng Xiaoyao was like, she was his granddaughter and he would love her as usual, but he liked the current Leng Xiaoyao more. She was confident and powerful and didn’t pay any attention to Chu Jianan.

“I just have worries,” Leng Yecheng said, feeling aggrieved.

“Alright, no need to worry. I won’t go back to who I was before. I’ve carefully thought about it. I’ll keep on being this confident. I don’t care about Chu Jianan at all now. He’s a trash man without moral standards. I don’t want him,” Leng Xiaoyao said, her voice filled with disdain for Chu Jianan.

Because she changed suddenly, no one could believe that she was really different, but she seemed very serious.

Anyway, they were both sophisticated and had seen countless people before, it wasn’t difficult for them to make a correct judgment about someone. Therefore, they could see that Leng Xiaoyao was truly different now. They were only worried about whether she would go back to normal after today.

Leng Xiaoyao said she wouldn’t, but they felt it was hard to say.

Before long, the steak was ready, so Leng Xiaoyao went to eat.

Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng stayed in the living room and quietly talked about Leng Xiaoyao.

“Dad, do you think Xiaoyao is really totally different?” Leng Yecheng asked.

“I feel it’s not that easy. How could an adult change so completely all of a sudden? I wonder what happened today to make Yaoyao change so much. I wanted to ask about it, but felt it was inappropriate,” Leng Changyuan said worriedly.

As a cultivator, Leng Xiaoyao heard their conversation, so she directly said, “Grandpa, uncle, you can ask me about anything. No need to be so worried. Anyway, I heard that Leng Yuqi, Chu Jianan, and the others were hanging out together today, so I sneaked out and followed them. I saw Leng Yuqi and Chu Jianan kiss and hug. I couldn’t stand it, so I ran to beat Leng Yuqi, but Chu Jianan pushed me down. I passed out and had a long dream. I can’t remember what I dreamed about, but I suddenly lost interest in Chu Jianan after I woke up. And his behavior really disgusted me, so I beat them.”

“What? Chu Jianan pushed you down and you passed out?”

Knowing that, Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng were scared. They abruptly stood up from the sofa. Looking at Leng Xiaoyao, they were obviously angry.

Without doubt, they were mad at Chu Jianan.

“Yeah, but don’t worry. I’m not injured.” Leng Xiaoyao immediately comforted them once she saw that they were anxious.

However, they were still angry. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What Chu Jianan has done is totally unacceptable. How dare he hurt Yaoyao?” Leng Changyuan shook a little from the fury. He directly ignored the fact that it was Leng Xiaoyao who tried to beat Leng Yuqi first, causing Chu Jianan to push her down.

Because Leng Yuqi’s behavior was too unacceptable, they believed that she deserved it even if Leng Xiaoyao really beat her.

“I can’t wait to beat Chu Jianan right now.” Leng Yecheng clenched his teeth and fists. It seemed as if he was going to have a fight.

“I’ve already taught him a lesson. If he dares to mess with me again, I’ll beat him again!” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Hearing that, Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng finally realized that Leng Xiaoyao had beaten them. Therefore, Leng Changyuan asked, “Oh, Yaoyao, how did you beat all of them?”

It was unbelievable that she defeated four people by herself.

“I was bullied too many times, so I secretly practiced kung fu. Now it has come to use,” Leng Xiaoyao replied.

Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng didn’t doubt that. Instead, they felt it was a good thing that Leng Xiaoyao could protect herself.

“How strong are you right now?” Leng Yecheng asked.

“I can defeat seven ordinary people who don’t have any skills,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t want to surprise them, so she didn’t tell the truth.

Although her abilities were restricted now, even professional killers were still no match for her.

“Really?”

Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng were shocked and happy.

…

After Song Meiyu got home, she called Leng Yuqi. Leng Yuqi and the others went to the hospital after Leng Xiaoyao left, and the medical result was just released.

They weren’t seriously injured, but their stomachs were still aching.

When Leng Yuqi heard that Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t be punished, she was really furious. Did they have to swallow the humiliation?

However, when she heard that Leng Xiaoyao wanted to end the engagement, she was excited. She thought Leng Xiaoyao was lying when she told them that earlier.

“Mom, is Leng Xiaoyao really going to end the engagement?” Leng Yuqi asked. She was afraid it might not be real. After all, she loved Chu Jianan so deeply, and it was impossible for her to give him up.

If she could, she would have done that early on, and wouldn’t have waited so long.

“She said so. Your grandfather and third uncle also agreed to do it with her tomorrow. I don’t know whether it’ll be true in the end,” Song Meiyu explained. She was also afraid that Leng Xiaoyao would regret it.

“As long as they visit the Chu family and ask to end the engagement, it will be ended. After all, the whole Chu family wants to end it,” Leng Yuqi said.

“I know, but I’m afraid Leng Xiaoyao will regret it by then,” Song Meiyu said. She hoped that Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t do that.

“I hope she won’t,” Leng Yuqi said. Even if Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to end the engagement, Chu Jianan wouldn’t marry her. However, if Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to end the engagement, it would be more troublesome.
