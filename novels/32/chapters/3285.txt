3288 Go Apologize

When Mrs. Jiang saw Jiang Youming return in a rage, she quickly asked, “Youming, have you found out who’s behind this? Who did this?”

“It’s Leng Yehua,” Jiang Youming said.

“What? Don’t you have a good relationship with him? Why would he do this?” Mrs. Jiang was surprised and asked in confusion.

“It’s all because of your well-educated daughter. She stole Chu Jianan away from Leng Yuqi, and even went to a hotel with him…” Jiang Youming’s anger, which he had just suppressed, rose again and he lashed out at his wife.

“What?”

Mrs. Jiang was also surprised. She couldn’t believe that her daughter would do such a thing.

Although Mrs. Jiang didn’t care about moral standards, she had her own principles. At most, she was just a bit more open-minded.

While she did hope that Jiang Yihan could marry Chu Jianan because of his good family background, she didn’t want her daughter to be so reckless in pursuing him. What was the difference between that and being a mistress?

As a woman, she hated mistresses the most, so naturally she didn’t want her daughter to be one.

If Chu Jianan and Leng Yuqi were no longer good friends, then Jiang Yihan could approach Chu Jianan. However, since Leng Yuqi and Chu Jianan were dating, she couldn’t steal Chu Jianan away and even stay in the same hotel room with him.

Mrs. Jiang couldn’t accept it.

Although it took two to tango, it was undeniable that Jiang Yihan was in the wrong.

If the news were to be spread, the Jiang family would be extremely humiliated!

Besides, because of Jiang Yihan’s deeds, the Jiang family suffered a not-so-small loss. If they didn’t handle it well, the losses could be even greater.

“What did Leng Yehua say about this?” Mrs. Jiang asked, knowing that this matter might not be easy to handle. If someone did this to her daughter, she wouldn’t let it go easily. After all, every parent loved their child.

“Yihan should apologize first. Leng Yehua shouldn’t go too far. After all, both of our families are powerful. If things get worse, it will only be a lose-lose situation,” Jiang Youming said.

Anyway, he didn’t want to suffer any losses.

Since it was caused by their daughter, it was better to minimize the damage.

Mrs. Jiang didn’t know what to say and hoped that it could be resolved peacefully.

However, with Yihan causing such trouble, the Chu family might not approve of her. If Chu Jianan abandoned Jiang Yihan in the future, it would be a double loss for them.

As soon as Jiang Yihan came in, Jiang Youming slapped her and angrily scolded her, “You’re shameless! How could you do such a thing as stealing your friend’s man and going out to sleep with him? How shameless can you be!? ”

After being slapped, tears immediately streamed down Jiang Yihan’s face, but she didn’t dare to make a sound.

Jiang Youming continued. “Do you know how much damage you have caused to our family? Did you not think about the consequences before doing this? The Leng family even retaliated against our company…”

Upon hearing that, Jiang Yihan was surprised. She couldn’t believe that the Leng family would retaliate against their company.

Why did her family have to be dragged into trouble due to their personal affair?

Jiang Yihan couldn’t understand or accept it.

With this thought in mind, Jiang Yihan said, “This is originally a matter between me and Leng Yuqi, how can their family interfere with ours? This is too much…”

Jiang Youming laughed in anger and said, “Does that mean if someone kills you, it’s also a matter between you and them and we don’t have to do anything?”

“I…” Jiang Yihan was struck dumb for a second and was speechless, because she thought it was impossible. If she was bullied outside, her family would definitely support her.

“Tell me, when did you start with Chu Jianan?” Jiang Youming asked sternly.

“Not even a month ago,” Jiang Yihan weakly replied.

“How did you get together?” Jiang Youming asked again.

This time, Jiang Yihan didn’t know how to answer it because she didn’t want to admit that she had seduced Chu Jianan.

In fact, Chu Jianan was interested in her too, that was why he took the bait! So it wasn’t entirely her fault, but she didn’t dare to push all the blame onto Chu Jianan. What if he found out and got angry with her and didn’t want to be with her any longer?

“Tell me.” Jiang Youming snapped at her.

Jiang Yihan was frightened and had to be honest. “That day, I-I drank too much. He took me to the hotel, and then…”

She couldn’t say the rest.

“But Jianan said he likes me too, that’s why we got together,” Jiang Yihan said.

“Chu Jianan isn’t a good man. He was with Leng Yuqi because he didn’t like Leng Xiaoyao. How long has it been since they broke up? Now he’s messing with you. I don’t think Chu Jianan really likes you. He’s just playing with you,” Mrs. Jiang said. Right now her impression of Chu Jianan couldn’t be worse.

“…”

Jiang Yihan opened her mouth to defend Chu Jianan but also felt that what her mother said was right, so she didn’t know what to do next.

Could it be that Chu Jianan was really just playing with her?

Jiang Yihan was a little hurt inside and didn’t want it to be true.

“We’ll talk about these things later. Let’s visit the Leng family right now and apologize to Leng Yuqi,” Jiang Youming said. He didn’t want to pursue so much. Solving the company’s problems was more important.

“I don’t want to apologize to her.” Jiang Yihan felt very resistant as soon as she heard that she had to apologize to Leng Yuqi.

‘Slap!’

The moment Jiang Yihan finished speaking, she was slapped by Jiang Youming. Jiang Youming was angry and said, “What did you say? Do you want our family to suffer even more losses? You caused the trouble, and we helped you deal with it. Is it wrong? If you don’t apologize, then get out of the Jiang family. We don’t have a daughter like you.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Jiang Youming had always been good to Jiang Yihan, but he still had the mindset of valuing sons over daughters. His company would be inherited by his son in the future, so the trouble that Jiang Yihan caused this time had caused a lot of losses to the Jiang family’s company, and he was really angry with Jiang Yihan.

If Jiang Yihan didn’t know how to behave, he really might abandon her!

“I… ” Jiang Yihan was scared and also felt very angry. She thought that Jiang Youming was being too harsh.

The Jiang family wasn’t inferior to the Leng family. Why were they afraid of them?

Mrs. Jiang, however, didn’t think that Jiang Youming’s words were too serious. On the contrary, she knew that he would do what he said, so she quickly persuaded her daughter. “Yihan, listen to your father and apologize. If you don’t apologize, the Leng family won’t let it go. You should pay for what you’ve done.”

Jiang Yihan realized the seriousness of the situation, so even though she was unwilling, she had to agree to apologize.

Therefore, Jiang Youming immediately took Jiang Yihan to visit the Leng family. Time was money, so wasting time meant losing money!
