Chapter 2788: Cause the Chang Family Trouble

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After sending him a message, Gu Ning gave him a call to make sure he would read the message as soon as possible.

Leng Shaoming was a little upset after the call.

Hearing their conversation, Zhan Zhiyin didn’t understand why Leng Shaoming was so upset because she didn’t know that Leng Shaoming used to hold hatred for Gu Ning.

She didn’t want to gossip about it, but she worried about Leng Shaoming, so she asked, “Are you alright?”

Leng Shaoming understood that Zhan Zhiyin felt his emotional change. He didn’t want her to misunderstand his feelings for Gu Ning, so he explained. “I just feel guilty for my hatred towards Gu Ning and Shaoting in the past. They’re so kind to me.”

Knowing that, Zhan Zhiyin nodded, but she didn’t feel it was a big deal. It was unavoidable that brothers would compete with each other. As long as it didn’t get too serious, it wouldn’t be a problem.

The moment Leng Shaoming finished, he realized that Zhan Zhiyin might disdain his behavior, so he asked nervously, “Will you despise me?”

Zhan Zhiyin beamed and said, “Why? It’s unavoidable for brothers and sisters to compete with each other. And you’re getting along well now.”

“Right, I was immature, so I was jealous of Shaoting because he’s so outstanding. Since I was jealous of him, I wasn’t very nice. But now I’m more mature and stable and we’re getting closer,” said Leng Shaoming. He didn’t hide that he used to be very jealous of Leng Shaoting because of his achievements.

“Um, some of my family members are also jealous of me, especially my third aunt. She never wants me to live a good life. And she even tried to set me up with her terrible nephew. At the beginning, my parents didn’t know how terrible he was and asked me to spend some time with him, but they learned about his bad deeds afterwards and heavily criticized my third aunt,” said Zhan Zhiyin, half seriously. She wasn’t complaining, she simply wanted to distract Leng Shaoming. She didn’t want him to be in a bad mood.

“Oh, what’s your attitude towards your third aunt’s nephew then?” Leng Shaoming squinted at Zhan Zhiyin, looking dangerous, but he actually wasn’t displeased at all.

Obviously, Zhan Zhiyin had no interest in that man.

Seeing Leng Shaoming’s dangerous look, Zhan Zhiyin didn’t think he was mad. In fact, she would be happier if he was really mad, because it meant he cared about her.

“I hate him! I even punched him a few times because he wouldn’t let me go.” Upon thinking of Xu Zhihao, Zhan Zhiyin felt disgusted. “You’re the only man I care about. I have no interest in any other men. Oh, I also care about my grandfather, or Zhan Zhiyin’s grandfather. And her father and older brother. I’m not the real Zhan Zhiyin, but I treat her family as my own since they treat me so well.”

Zhan Zhiyin always wanted to be close to Leng Shaoming, so Leng Shaoming was very touched. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I have the same feeling as you. I also treat them as my family,” said Leng Shaoming. They were a couple now, so he took it seriously.

Although it was hard to say whether they would get married in the future, there was no need for them to think so much. As long as they treated each other well, they would be happy together.

Zhan Zhiyin was touched and said, “Are you serious? You already said it, which means we’ll become a family.”

Leng Shaoming rubbed Zhan Zhiyin’s hair with a loving gaze, then he said with a smile, “Yeah, I mean it.”

About half an hour later, K had the result and contacted Leng Shaoming.

From the surveillance cameras, K found out the man’s real appearance and identity.

Although the man had contacted the Yuan family, he wasn’t a member of the Yuan family and they weren’t close. Instead, he had a close relationship with the Chang family.

Therefore, the mastermind was highly likely to be the Chang family, but they didn’t have solid evidence because they couldn’t rely on the Internet to do everything.

It turned out that they were right. Although the man said he was a member of the Yuan family, the Yuan family wasn’t the real mastermind.

With that answer, Leng Shaoming called Leng Yuanqian before he went aboard.

At this moment, Leng Yuanqian had already met Gu Ning outside the airport and had just gotten his plane ticket.

Seeing Leng Shaoming’s call, Leng Yuanqian picked it up at once. After that, Leng Shaoming shared the result with him.

Leng Yuanqian wasn’t surprised when he heard that the mastermind wasn’t the Yuan family and was instead the Chang family. Anyway, they were both suspects.

Since they knew it was the Chang family, they would pay special attention to the Chang family afterwards.

Without delay, Leng Shaoming I formed Master Leng about it since he could only rely on Master Leng to manage the Leng family well.

At this time, only Master Leng and Jing Yunyao were in the Leng family’s house. Jing Yunyao came to see Master Leng early in the morning.

Master Leng didn’t avoid Jing Yunyao when he saw that it was Leng Shaoming’s call. He knew it was about the crisis the Leng family was facing and Jing Yunyao was an important member of the Leng family now, so she had to know about it.

Master Leng wasn’t surprised either when he heard the result. Instead, he thought it was more reasonable for the mastermind to be the Chang family.

Although they didn’t have evidence to prove it yet, it was highly likely to be the truth given what they found out.

“Great, the Chang family, they’re always troublesome,” said Master Leng with displeasure.

“Why don’t we cause them some trouble?” Jing Yunyao squinted.

“How?” Master Leng asked.

“We can cause Master Chang to become bedridden. His elder son could have a car accident and get lightly injured. We can also leave some illegal stuff in the Chang family’s residence and the police may have interest in it. As long as they’re in a mess as well, they won’t have time and energy to scheme against the Leng family,” said Jing Yunyao.

“But it’s not easy not to be exposed after doing all the above,” said Master Leng. He supported Jing Yunyao’s plans. Although they sounded cruel, the Chang family was their enemy. They had no mercy for their enemies.
