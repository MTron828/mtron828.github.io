Chapter 2103: I Won’t Hurt You

Gu Ning and the others went to dine together after they had fun till the afternoon.

Gu Ning planned to leave alone after having dinner, but she sensed the air of the Evil Practice when she walked out of the restaurant. Besides, the member of the Evil Practice was staring at them.

To be specific, the evil cultivator was staring at her and Baili Zongxue.

She and Baili Zongxue were a girl born in a lunar year and a cultivator, which was quite helpful for the evil cultivator, so the evil cultivator wanted them both.

Since they were targeted, they had to face it.

In order to not hurt the innocent, Gu Ning told Baili Zongxue to stay and let the others leave.

She made up an excuse that they needed to visit their friend in the hospital, so she couldn’t go with them.

Hearing that, the others understood and left before them.

“Gu Ning, who’s in the hospital?” After they were gone, Baili Zongxue asked worriedly. She thought what Gu Ning said was true.

Their common friends were Song Miaoge and Zhang Zikai.

“No, I lied to them because I found someone is following us. I’m the target, so I told them to leave first in case they got hurt.” Gu Ning said, then asked, “Are you mad that I kept you with me?”

Although the evil cultivator wanted them both, if they separated, the evil cultivator was highly likely to attack Baili Zongxue because Baili Zongxue’s level as a cultivator was much more useful than Gu Ning who was a girl born in a lunar year.

Gu Ning didn’t want Zi Beiying and the others to be hurt because of them, so she could only keep Baili Zongxue with her.

However, in order to keep her secrets Gu Ning couldn’t tell Baili Zongxue that the person was an evil cultivator, so she made up an excuse.

Anyway, Gu Ning was afraid that her secrets would be exposed soon, because she was a new cultivator and her own abilities weren’t enough to defeat the evil cultivator. Baili Zongxue alone wasn’t able to do it either, so she had to use her magical energy.

Hearing that, Baili Zongxue was mad, but she definitely wasn’t mad at Gu Ning for telling her to stay. “I don’t mind at all. We’re friends. We should deal with difficulties together.”

“Great, let’s go now. Since we’re being targeted, we have to face it. Once the person shows up, we’ll beat him or her to prevent more trouble from being made,” said Gu Ning.

In fact, even if they wanted to avoid it, they might not be able to do that, otherwise Gu Ning would have left earlier. In that case, she wouldn’t need to face the evil cultivator and expose her secrets.

“Sure,” said Baili Zongxue.

After that, they walked in another direction and Gu Ning could feel that the evil cultivator was still following them.

As they walked, Gu Ning suddenly asked Baili Zongxue seriously, “Zongxue, we’re friends. Even if you know one of my secrets, you won’t tell other people or betray me, right?”

Actually, Gu Ning trusted Baili Zongxue, or she wouldn’t have asked her that question.

Even if Baili Zongxue really told other people, she wouldn’t be in danger because she had no grudge against the cultivation world. The cultivation world wouldn’t punish her even if it found out.

If someone really wanted to hurt her, Gu Ning wouldn’t be afraid either because Shangguan Yang supported her.

Gu Ning became so serious all of a sudden, so Baili Zongxue was struck dumb for a second, then felt anxious. Did Gu Ning find out her purpose for forming a good relationship with her?

“Gu Ning, I won’t hurt you.” Baili Zongxue didn’t know how to answer Gu Ning’s question, because she wasn’t sure whether she would tell other people about Gu Ning’s secrets. However, she could promise that she wouldn’t hurt Gu Ning because she sincerely took Gu Ning as her friend, even though she approached Gu Ning for a purpose.

Hearing Baili Zongxue’s answer, Gu Ning understood that she couldn’t keep her secret between them. Gu Ning could understand it though. She also believed that Baili Zongxue wouldn’t hurt her. The Baili family didn’t have backstabbers.

“Great, I trust you,” said Gu Ning, but she couldn’t tell Baili Zongxue what the secret was.

Baili Zongxue felt guilty facing Gu Ning, so she didn’t ask further about that.

There was a park ahead of Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue. A man-made lake was in the park, and there was a forest next to it, which was relatively secluded, so Gu Ning planned to lead the evil cultivator over.

It wasn’t 8 pm yet, but there weren’t many people in the park. After all, it was already cold in November, so few people came out to have a walk. And even though there were some people, they all stayed on the square and rarely walked by the man-made lake.

The evil cultivator had no idea that she was already exposed, because Gu Ning was only a mortal in her eyes. It was impossible for a mortal to notice her, and Baili Zongxue was a cultivator, but her level was very average, so she couldn’t see the evil cultivator.

It was a she instead of a him, because the evil cultivator was a woman.

Baili Zongxue was a little upset because she didn’t notice that anyone was following them, but Gu Ning did. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, even though she was confused, Baili Zongxue didn’t ask about it. She believed that Gu Ning wouldn’t lie to her.

The evil cultivator didn’t have any doubts when Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue walked to a quiet place. She just focused on moving near them.

Once she found a great chance, she moved fast to attack Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue with pride in her eyes. She believed that she could knock them down within seconds. She might just have a short fight against Baili Zongxue.

If they had been mortals, they would be caught by her without even noticing her, but Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl. Moreover, Gu Ning could sense every movement of the evil cultivator.

Therefore, once the evil cultivator came near, Baili Zongxue felt the threat and saw the evil cultivator.

In an instant, Baili Zongxue was scared. Since it was an evil cultivator, Baili Zongxue was sure that the woman came for her and Gu Ning was in trouble because of her.

Baili Zongxue had that idea because her level was low and she was a good cultivator. She couldn’t smell the air of a girl born in a lunar year from Gu Ning’s body.

After Baili Zongxue was frightened, she immediately fought back and shouted, “Gu Ning, move away. Leave her to me.”

Although Baili Zongxue knew that Gu Ning was very good at martial arts, the woman was an evil cultivator. Mortals were no match for her and she was afraid that Gu Ning might be injured.

Gu Ning didn’t move away, and instead attacked the evil cultivator before Baili Zongxue.
