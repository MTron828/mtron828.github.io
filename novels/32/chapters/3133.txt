When Miss Wu saw that her admirers changed their opinions about her, she was furious. “Don’t be ridiculous!” She criticized Leng Xiaoyao.

Even though Leng Xiaoyao pointed the differences of her face out, Mis Wu refused to admit it. Instead, she criticized Leng Xiaoyao for getting her wrong.

“Then do you dare rub your nose and jaw like me?” Leng Xiaoyao said and heavily rubbed her nose and jaw. Given the force she used, if her nose and jaw were fake, they would surely be broken. Even if not now, they would be broken later.

Leng Xiaoyao continued. “I know I have freckles all over my face, but it doesn’t mean I’m ugly. After all, people rely on quality clothing to be beautiful. With make-up on, I don’t think anyone can be ugly.”

!!

When everyone saw that Leng Xiaoyao heavily rubbed her nose and jaw and nothing happened, they believed that she didn’t have any surgery.

In that case, Leng Xiaoyao was really born beautiful.

She was right. Even if she had freckles all over her face, it didn’t mean she was ugly. Nowadays women went out with make-up on all the time. No one could see their bare faces. There was no need to care about the shortcomings.

As for the freckles, they weren’t a serious problem and could be removed.

There were medicines to remove freckles. Although they weren’t effective for everyone, they might be effective for Leng Xiaoyao.

At that moment, An Chenmeng walked over and said provocatively, “Right, didn’t you hear what our boss said? Do you dare to rub your nose and jaw?”

An Chenmeng was wearing a red gown which was adjusted from a cheongsam. Her dress top was loose and had an asymmetrical skirt. She didn’t look sexy nor cute, instead she looked cool, which matched her very well.

However, An Chenmeng wasn’t powerful enough to look strong.

When Leng Yuqi saw that An Chenmeng also dressed maturely, she hated her gown even more than before. To be honest, An Chenmeng was very attractive too.

Miss Wu was so angry that she couldn’t say anything again. She obviously didn’t dare to rub her nose or jaw. Even if they wouldn’t be broken right now, they would be damaged.

She had spent hundreds of thousands of yuan on her face, so she couldn’t ruin it just because she was angry.

“Today is Mater Mo’s birthday. I don’t want to argue with you.” Miss Wu snorted, then turned around and wanted to walk away.

She made it sound as if Leng Xiaoyao was wrong.

If Leng Xiaoyao was alone, she wouldn’t care about that, but the Leng family was here today, so she had to take it seriously, otherwise the Leng family would be embarrassed.

People might think the Leng family was as unreasonable as her and didn’t stop her.

Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao said, “It’s you who stirred things up. Now are you trying to blame me? Should I be silent when you said that I had facial reconstruction surgery? Why should I tolerate your meanness? Don’t put the blame on me for your fault. If you want to get respect from other people, you should learn to respect others first. Don’t try to defame other people when you’re wrong.”

In fact, many guests indeed thought Leng Xiaoyao was unreasonable after hearing Miss Wu’s words, but they began to support Leng Xiaoyao when she fought back. After all, it was Miss Wu who made things difficult for Leng Xiaoyao first.

Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao did nothing wrong, so she shouldn’t be silent when someone puts the blame on her. Otherwise people would think she really had facial reconstruction surgery.

“You…” Miss Wu was mad when she had to bear the result of her mistake, but she didn’t know what to say.

“Grandpa, let’s go inside. We can rest somewhere for a while.” Leng Xiaoyao stopped since there was no need to continue to argue with Miss Wu. She held Leng Changyuan, walking away.

“Boss, don’t forget me!” An Chenmeng complained when Leng Xiaoyao ignored her.

“Do you need me to call you? We’re too close to do that,” Leng Xiaoyao said, turning around to look at her.

“Right, we’re too close to be so polite.” An Chenmeng caught up with Leng Xiaoyao at once. Then she greeted Leng Changyuan. “Nice to see you, Grandpa Leng. I’m Xiaoyao’s friend, An Chenmeng. I was born in the An family.”

“Nice to meet you too. What an adorable girl,” Leng Changyuan with a smile. He indeed felt An Chenmeng was likable, but the An family… He had to admit that his granddaughter was really charming. Even the An family’s daughter was willing to call her boss.

When Leng Yehua and Song Meiyu heard that An Chenmeng was so close to Leng Xiaoyao, they lost their calm again.

“Where are your parents?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“They met people that they knew outside and they’re chatting. I saw you just then, so I came over first. I don’t want to stay together with them. It’s so boring,” An Chenmeng said. She didn’t want to be with her parents. After all, she came because Leng Xiaoyao came.

It was a banquet party and all the guests stood while they were socializing, but at the side of the hall, there was a lounge, so Leng Xiaoyao supported Leng Changyuan in the lounge.

Leng Changyuan was too old to stand for a long time, and Leng Yecheng also needed a rest.

At the lounge, Leng Changyuan saw familiar faces, so they chatted.

When the other people saw Leng Xiaoyao, they also complimented her. They didn’t forget An Chenmeng, because An Chenmeng was attractive too. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

On the other hand, Leng Yuqi was mostly ignored. She lost her calm because of that, but there was nothing she could do.

After greeting the elders, Leng Yehua also went to chat with people he was familiar with, while Song Meiyu went to chat with noble ladies she had a relationship with.

Because Leng Yuqi’s friends weren’t here yet, she stayed with Leng Changyuan for the time being.

An Chenmeng’s friends saw her sitting with Leng Xiaoyao after walking inside, so they walked towards them afterwards.

Leng Xiaoyao had saved An Chenmeng’s life, so An Chenmeng’s parents were grateful to her. In addition, they had a very good impression of Leng Xiaoyao. Therefore, they felt it was necessary for them to exchange greetings with the Leng family.

When other guests saw Mr. An and Mrs. An exchanging greetings with Leng Changyuan, they were slightly surprised mainly because Mr. An and Mrs. An were very polite.

It didn’t seem to be just because of manners either, they treated the Leng family sincerely.

In fact, the An family was much richer than the Leng family.
