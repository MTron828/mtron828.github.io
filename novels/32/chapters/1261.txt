Chapter 1263: Look at Houses

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The sales manager didn’t doubt Gu Ning’s words. Even though he wasn’t familiar with Gu Ning, he knew Gu Ning wouldn’t do it for no reason.

“Please...” Saleswoman B and Saleswoman C tried to defend themselves, but they were nobodies in front of Gu Ning. They were unwilling to leave Shenghua Real Estate.

“Disappear, now!” The manager lost his patience. He had told them to be polite to their potential clients many times before, but these two saleswomen ignored the rules.

Since they broke the rules, they had to bear the consequences. If the manager didn’t punish them severely this time, other salesmen would do the same thing.

When the two saleswomen were directly fired, the other people in the hall felt pleased. At the same time, they were curious to know Gu Ning’s identity.

She must be a very important figure for her to be able to fire the two saleswomen as she liked.

Other salesmen in the hall, on the other hand, became nervous and cautious, because none of them wanted to lose their jobs.

Saleswoman B and Saleswoman C could do nothing now, and they had to leave in silence. They hated Gu Ning and blamed Gu Ning for everything, but they didn’t dare to argue with her again.

“Miss Gu, shall we go to see the houses right now?” the sales manager asked Gu Ning.

“Sure.” Gu Ning nodded.

The two saleswomen were already fired, so there was no need for her to waste her time here.

...

There were many plants in Jiahua Garden, so it was like a beautiful garden. People could walk, run, or exercise inside.

A-05 and A-06 were next to each other, and Gu Ning had kept them for Gu Man and Gu Qing.

Although Gu Man moved to City B now, Gu Ning still kept it for her.

Gu Qing’s family now lived in Fenghua Luxury Mansion, but it wasn’t a bad thing to have another good house.

Jiang Xinyue could move into this house when she grew older, she was going to leave her parents one day in the future after all. In addition, it was a good thing for a girl to have her own house.

Both A-05 and A-06 occupied a piece of land that was 500 square-meters.

There was a front yard and a backyard along with a swimming pool around the house.

Each house had three stories.

Although the houses in Jiahua Garden weren’t as luxurious as those in Fenghua Luxury Mansion, they were very expensive.

Gu Ning had told An Guangyao not to furnish and decorate the two houses immediately, so the two houses were empty. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Gu Man and Gu Qing didn’t need them right now, so Gu Ning decided to furnish and decorate them when An Guangyao had enough free time.

An Guangyao was responsible for the furnishing and decoration of these two houses, and Gu Ning wanted them to be warm, useful, and of good quality.

Gu Ning didn’t stay in Jiahua Garden for long, because she came here simply to have a look at the two houses.

The whole living area was owned by her, and she could come here whenever she wanted after all.

...

After leaving Jiahua Garden, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to an amusement park.

It was still early, so they had enough time to enjoy themselves.

An amusement park wasn’t only open to kids. Adults could also have fun inside. Actually, children under the age of 15 weren’t allowed to use many amusement facilities. Therefore, most visitors in the amusement park were young people.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t use many of the amusement facilities. They simply wandered around to relax themselves. It was much more pleasant to walk around in the amusement park than on the street after all.

Because Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were too attractive, many people paid attention to them when they walked by.

Some of them recognized Gu Ning and got excited. They greeted Gu Ning of their own accord, and Gu Ning also smiled at them.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting left the amusement park at 5 pm.

Leng Shaoting planned to buy some gifts before they went to Gu Ning’s home, but Gu Ning stopped him.

Gu Ning’s family were only staying in City F for a few days, and it wasn’t convenient for them to bring so many gifts back to City B. Moreover, it wasn’t their first meeting, so it wasn’t necessary to prepare gifts for them.

Although Leng Shaoting thought that it might be a little impolite if he visited her family without gifts, Gu Ning persuaded him to listen to her.

At 5:30 pm, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were back in Fenghua Luxury Mansion. Gu Ning received Gu Man’s call just as she stepped out of the car. Gu Ning then told Gu Man that they were already back.
