Chapter 541 Go to City B with Gu Man

Hearing what Gu Ning had just said, Tang Haifeng was finally relieved and burst into tears.

“Girl Gu, thank you so much for your understanding. We owe you and your mother a lot, and we do hope that you can give us a chance to make it up to you so that you can accept us, especially your father, as your family,” Tang Haifeng said with sincerity.

Gu Man was the only woman Tang Yunfan loved and Gu Ning was his only child too, so Tang Haifeng sincerely hoped that they could accept the Tang family and join them. Although they didn’t know much about Gu Ning or Gu Man yet, they valued family above anything else.

It wasn’t a common thing among the super-rich families, because Gu Ning was very likely to be the heir of the Tanghuang Group and take away the property from other members in the Tang family.

Of course, Gu Ning had no intention to do that, because she preferred to build up her own business empire by herself.

“Grandpa, don’t worry. I don’t have any grudge against the Tang family. My mother and Uncle Tang need some time to get familiar with one another again, but the most important and urgent thing we have to deal with now is to wake him up,” Gu Ning said. Before they accepted each other as family, she still called Tang Yunfan Uncle Tang.

“Oh, you’re right!” Tang Haifeng realized that it was too early to discuss that now, because Tang Yunfan hadn’t woken up yet. Moreover, Gu Man also had the right to make the decision on her own, and they couldn’t force her to do what they wanted.

Tang Haifeng inhaled deeply to calm himself down, then opened his mouth. “Mingkai said that Yunfan’s obsession is your mother and you. If you can talk to him he might wake up.”

Hearing that, Gu Ning’s eyes lit up at once. She thought that it was highly possible to be true. Otherwise, why was Tang Yunfan still unconscious, even though his body was in good condition?

Gu Ning had already witnessed the reality of magical power, zombies, and Yin, so it wasn’t difficult for her to believe that obsession could also be true. Even though it might not be because of obsession, Gu Ning would give it a try as long as it was possible.

“If so, I’m more than willing to do that, but I have to discuss it with my mother first,” Gu Ning said. She had to respect Gu Man’s opinions.

“Sure-sure,” Tang Haifeng said excitedly. Although Gu Ning hadn’t agreed yet, he knew that she was willing to help them.

“Girl Gu, if you’ve made your decision, call me and I’ll send a private jet to pick you up,” Tang Haifeng said.

“No problem.”

Gu Ning and Gu Man could actually fly there on their own, which could save a lot of time too, but Gu Ning still accepted Tang Haifeng’s proposal, because they had their dignity.

The Tang family had to show their kindness and be respectful of Gu Ning’s as well as Gu Man’s importance so that Gu Ning and Gu Man would accept them as family.

Gu Ning also hoped that Gu Man and Tang Yunfan could be happy together in the future, but she wouldn’t allow anyone in the Tang Family to disrespect Gu Man.

Gu Ning didn’t care about the wealth and influence of the Tang Family. Even if Tang Yunfan was an ordinary man or even a beggar, she would still be supportive as long as he treated Gu Man well.

After hanging up, Gu Ning went back to the private room.

“Ningning, you’ve been out on the phone for so long. Was it really important?” Gu Man asked with concern.

Gu Ning didn’t hide it but told her directly, “Grandpa Tang just called me.”

Hearing that, Gu Man’s body stiffened a little. She subconsciously thought that it had to be something about Tang Yunfan. “What happened to him?” She asked in a hurry.

“Grandpa Tang said that a friend of his told him that Uncle Tang is still unconscious because he’s trapped by his obsession, and his obsession is you and me. If we can talk to him he might wake up, so Grandpa Tang called me and asked me whether we’re willing to do so,” Gu Ning said. “Grandpa Tang also said that he hopes that we can join the Tang family as their family. What do you think?”

“Well...” Gu Man didn’t know what to do now. She was, of course, willing to help Tang Yunfan, but she wasn’t mentally prepared yet to be a member of the Tang family right now. Besides, upon thinking about it she would panic.

“Mom, don’t worry. Just follow your heart and make a choice,” Gu Ning said.

In Gu Ning’s eyes, the Tang family was barely comparable to Gu Man, just like Tang Yunfan was irreplaceable for the Tang family. If she had to make a choice between them, Gu Ning wouldn’t hesitate to choose Gu Man over the Tang family and the Tang family would choose Tang Yunfan over Gu Ning and Gu Man too.

“Man, Ningning is right. Don’t think too much and just follow your heart,” Gu Qing said. She also hoped that Gu Man could live a happy life in the future, but it wasn’t an easy choice.

If Gu Man had no feelings for Tang Yunfan or failed to love him again, she could give it up.

Gu Man remained silent for a while then said, “I can help him, but I need time to see how it goes between him and me.”

“Sure, then I’ll call Grandpa Tang now, and he’ll arrange a private jet to pick us up,” Gu Ning said. Tang Yunfan was in an urgent situation now, and they had nothing important to deal with in City F, so they decided to go to City B first.

“Aunt, do you mind going back alone?” Gu Ning asked Gu Qing.

“Of course not. Don’t worry about me. I can get your uncle to pick me up at the airport,” Gu Qing said. She was very considerate.

In the Tang family’s house, everyone asked Tang Haifeng for the result once he hung up the call with Gu Ning and walked back to the living hall.

Tang Haifeng told them about what Gu Ning had said to him on the phone, and they all relaxed knowing that Gu Ning and her mother didn’t hate Tang Yunfan. That was all they hoped for. In addition, they also understood that Gu Ning had to discuss with her mother first whether they should come and help to wake Tang Yunfan up. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Since Gu Ning and Gu Man needed time to accept them as their family, they were willing to wait as well.

As long as Gu Man didn’t hate Tang Yunfan, it was highly possible that she would get together with him again for the sake of their child, Gu Ning.

Right at this moment, Tang Haifeng’s phone rang, and the caller was Gu Ning.
