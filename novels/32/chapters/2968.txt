2970 Did She Fill the Blanks Randomly?

“I know it’s hard for you to believe, but I’ll prove it to you later. After the class begins in a while, you can point at me if the teacher wants a student to answer the question. You’ll see what I can do,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Because they had a good relationship with Leng Xiaoyao, Leng Xiaoyao had the patience to prove it to them.

Facing real friends, she had patience and sincerity and wouldn’t think that she was superior to them due to her status and abilities.

“Oh, really?” Wu Minmin asked with uncertainty, but she was looking forward to seeing that.

“I said we’re going to do that, so we’ll see,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Great, if the teacher wants a student to answer the question later, we’ll point at you.” Xiong Manxin and the other girls agreed.

Before the class began, the agreement between Leng Xiaoyao and An Chenmeng was already well-known to many people and everyone was surprised.

However, although they were surprised that Leng Xiaoyao could beat eight girls by herself, they didn’t think that she could surpass An Chenmeng in the exams.

It was impossible for a terrible student to become excellent within just a few days!

Even though Leng Xiaoyao had a big change, nobody would believe in her abilities before she proved herself.

After the news about Leng Xiaoyao went abroad, Leng Yuqi heard about it and was also shocked. How was it possible that Leng Xiaoyao beat eight girls by herself?

They had watched and experienced Leng Xiaoyao’s skills the day before yesterday, but Leng Xiaoyao seemed even stronger than last time.

An Chenmeng even wanted to regard Leng Xiaoyao as her boss, and Leng Xiaoyao proposed to compete with An Chenmeng in the exam.

She didn’t think Leng Xiaoyao would be better than An Chenmeng, but she fell into a bad mood since Leng Xiaoyao suddenly became very outstanding.

After Leng Xiaoyao and the other girls got back to the classroom, they attracted a lot of attention from other classmates. Everyone was surprised by the news that Leng Xiaoyao beat eight girls by herself, but no one believed that she could really surpass An Chenmeng in the exam.

However, they didn’t dare to annoy Leng Xiaoyao, so they said nothing.

The first afternoon class was math class. Because the math teacher had heard about the agreement between Leng Xiaoyao and An Chenmeng, he asked as soon as he walked in the classroom, “I just heard what happened between Leng Xiaoyao and An Chenmeng from Class 3. It’s really surprising that Leng Xiaoyao could beat eight girls, but Leng Xiaoyao, are you serious that you want to surpass An Chenmeng in the exam? Are you just saying it, or do you really have the confidence?”

Although he asked that, the math teacher didn’t think that Leng Xiaoyao could do better than An Chenmeng. After all, he had taught Leng Xiaoyao for three years, so he thought that he clearly knew her abilities.

However, since Leng Xiaoyao said that, he was curious to know why she wanted to do that.

“I’m not just saying it. If I was just saying it, I’d only embarrass myself. I seriously have the confidence to surpass An Chenmeng in the exam. Sir, if you don’t believe it, you can ask me several questions right now,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t need the other girls to point her out to answer the teacher’s questions. She could do that right away.

“Oh, if so, I’ll ask you several questions.” Hearing that, the math teacher got interested. He wanted to know whether Leng Xiaoyao’s confidence really came from her abilities.

Without delay, he picked up a chalk and wrote down several questions on the blackboard. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The other classmates looked at Leng Xiaoyao with mixed emotions. They weren’t as doubtful as earlier, because she asked the teacher to directly test her, which proved she really had the confidence, but it didn’t mean that she really had the ability.

At least, Leng Xiaoyao’s reaction proved that she was indeed different.

Did she really become excellent at fighting as well as studying all of a sudden?

They soon became full of anticipation too.

The math teacher wrote down three questions on the blackboard, then asked Leng Xiaoyao to answer them.

The three questions went from easy to difficult. Some classmates could answer the first and the second, but the last one was the most difficult.

Because they were the worst class, it was very normal that they couldn’t answer the questions. The questions should be easy for good classes.

In their class, most of the students were bad at studying, but not all of them were.

Nevertheless, the three questions couldn’t be easier in Leng Xiaoyao’s eyes, so she quickly wrote down her answers on the blackboard.

The students who didn’t know whether she was right had no reaction for the time being, but those who knew the answers were surprised.

Surprisingly, Leng Xiaoyao could really answer the questions.

Even the math teacher was astonished, because normally Leng Xiaoyao could barely answer questions that were easier than that.

Leng Xiaoyao quickly finished the first question, and her answer was correct, but not many students knew that.

“Hey, do you know if the boss’s answer is correct or not?” Xiong Manxin asked Wu Minmin.

“I’m sure her answer to the first question is correct,” Gao Ziyin said. She was the most academically inclined among them. Although she wasn’t an excellent student, she was sure that Leng Xiaoyao’s answer to the first question was correct.

Hearing that, they were all surprised.

“Jesus, boss really knows the answer.”

“I guess we need to believe our boss. Didn’t we doubt her abilities earlier when she fought? However, she shocked us in the end,” Tong Xiaobei said.

“Shell is right.”

The other girls agreed with her.

Shell was Tong Xiaobei’s nickname.

Xiong Manxin’s nickname was Little Panda, Wu Minmin’s was Little Witch, Tong Xiaobei’s was Shell, but Gao Lele and Gao Ziyin didn’t have a nickname, because there weren’t really any beautiful nicknames that matched their names.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t have a nickname either, because they all called her boss.

After that, she answered the second question, and her answer was again correct. In addition, she finished the questions very quickly. She barely spent any time thinking about it, which surprised everyone.

Moreover, most students couldn’t answer the second question.

“Is her answer correct?”

“I don’t know, because I don’t know the answer.”

“Did she just randomly fill in the blanks?”

“It’s possible.”
