2914 Wu Yiwei Confesses

“If I go with you, but it turns out to have nothing to do with me, can you pay the price for the damage to my reputation? Can justice do that? Show me solid proof if you have,” Wu Yiwei demanded.

“Miss Wu, if you disrupt public services, you can be punished according to the law,” the policeman said.

“You…” Wu Yiwei was mad, but didn’t dare to argue any longer, because it wouldn’t do her any good.

It was not only Wu Yiwei, her assistant was also taken away.

Wu Yiwei was taken away from the company, so the news quickly went abroad. Everyone was discussing the reason.

“Did she secretly scheme against someone out of jealousy?”

“I don’t think she would do that. Is there a mistake? Or was she framed?”

“You can’t judge a person from their appearance. Wu Yiwei isn’t a kind person. Some people prefer to scheme with others in private.”

“No idea. We can only find out after the result is out.”

“…”

On their way to the police station, Wu Yiwei still insisted on saying that she was innocent, but no one took her words seriously. The police would interrogate her at the police station.

In the police station, Wu Yiwei and her assistant were interrogated separately.

When Wu Yiwei wouldn’t stop saying that she was innocent, a policeman directly asked her, “Can you explain why you transferred six hundred thousand yuan to him?”

“My assistant borrowed money from me. She told me that her cousin was in trouble and might commit suicide if he couldn’t overcome it. My assistant has worked for me for years. She’s always been diligent and good at work. She turned to me for help, so I helped her. Anyway it’s not much money in my eyes,” Wu Yiwei said. It was a prepared answer, so she said it quickly.

“Do you mean it’s your assistant or her cousin who has a conflict with the victim? However, after our investigation, you are the one who has the motive to do it.”

“What? No, there is no grudge between me and Chu Peihan,” Wu Yiwei said. The moment she finished, she realized something wasn’t right.

The policeman laughed and said meaningfully, “Miss Wu, we didn’t tell you who the victim is, but you said it yourself. I think that’s enough. You’re not innocent at all.”

“I…” Wu Yiwei panicked at once. She didn’t realize that they hadn’t spoken about Chu Peihan at all until that moment. The policeman only said ‘the victim’.

At that moment, Wu Yiwei felt like giving herself a slap, but she couldn’t take the words back. She could only explain it to the best of her ability. “I heard it from other people.”

“You heard it from other people? Who told you? It’s not public yet,” the policeman said. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I-I…” Wu Yiwei was struck dumb. Because no one told her that, she suddenly didn’t know how to make it up.

“As far as we know, the leading actress of that TV show that you’re filming now was said to be you, but Chu Peihan replaced you before it was released. You were dissatisfied, so you decided to take revenge. During the shooting, you found fault with Miss Chu every now and then, but you didn’t want to cause a scene otherwise the show couldn’t be finished. Therefore, Miss Chu wasn’t really injured by you back then.”

“The show was completed later and you heard about the trouble your assistant’s cousin encountered. You wanted to make a deal with them and promised to give him six hundred thousand yuan if he helped you ruin Miss Chu. He could pay his debts back with five hundred thousand yuan and keep a hundred thousand yuan as compensation for his time in jail after he is arrested. Am I right?” the policeman asked.

“No, I didn’t. I didn’t…”

Hearing the policeman’s words, Wu Yiwei was extremely anxious, but she still denied it. As if she would be fine by doing that.

“Wu Yiwei, you have already been exposed. It’s useless no matter how you deny it,” the policeman continued.

“No, that’s not enough to prove I’m guilty!” Wu Yiwei argued.

At this time, the policeman walked out for a while, then came back. “Your assistant has already confessed.”

“What? She confessed? Didn’t we…” Wu Yiwei was mad and anxious, but she stopped the moment she realized that she said something wrong again, but unfortunately it was too late.

“You what? Did you agree to pin the blame on her cousin? Did you agree to deny it and claim that you know nothing?” the policeman asked.

Because the policeman pointed the truth out, Wu Yiwei didn’t know what to say.

“Wu Yiwei, if you confess to your crime, you can receive a lighter punishment. Otherwise it’ll be serious. We’ve collected solid proof. If you admit to it now, you might spend fewer years in jail,” the policeman said.

Wu Yiwei still said nothing, because she felt that Chu Peihan wouldn’t punish her lightly whether she admitted it or not, but she had to admit it in the end.

The police immediately called Chu Peihan and told her about the result.

After Wu Yiwei confessed, they still needed to charge her before they could sentence her.

The police filed a lawsuit the same day and Wu Yiwei went to the court the next day.

Because of that, the news went abroad and shocked a lot of people. They couldn’t believe that Wu Yiwei would do something like that.

She had worked in the entertainment industry for years, but she didn’t have much fame, so she didn’t have many fans.

Although Chu Peihan had joined the entertainment industry for only two years, she got popular quickly. She had many more fans than Wu Yiwei. So once Chu Peihan’s fans learned about Wu Yiwei’s deed, they heavily criticized her.

At the beginning, Wu Yiwei’s fans defended her, but they soon gave up.

Chu Peihan had support, not just from her fans, but from Han Chenglin’s, Gu Ning’s, and Shi Xiaoyue’s fans as well.

Besides, Wu Yiwei had broken the law, so no one dared to stand out for her.

Chu Peihan had her own company, so she didn’t have an agent. If anyone wanted to work with her, her company or she would talk about business with them.

Therefore, after the news came out, her company sent out a post for her.
