Chapter 1407: Full Score

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I agree with Peihan,” Yu Mixi said.

Since Yu Mixi believed that Gu Ning could have a total score of 749, Mu Ke supported her.

In the end, only Su Anya guessed that it might be 747.

When everyone had his or her guess, Gu Ning revealed her total score. It turned out to be a full score, 750 points!

In that case, nobody guessed correctly. Everyone was shocked, because it was too unbelievable to be true. No one had ever had a full-score essay before!

Gu Ning was actually also surprised by the result.

“750? D-Did I hear it right?”

“No way!”

“I can’t believe my ears.”

“Boss, you’re so amazing!”

“You have my respect.”

“Wow.”

“I must tell my parents.”

Everyone cheered and celebrated, as if they had the full score themselves.

After celebrating for a while, they went back to their own homes.

When Gu Ning was home, she called Leng Shaoting and shared the good news with him. Leng Shaoting was astonished by the result and felt proud of her.

Gu Ning told him to keep it a secret from Master Leng for now, because she personally wanted to tell Master Leng when he woke up.

...

When it was finally 7 am, Gu Ning called Tang Haifeng. She knew that Tang Haifeng was usually already up at this time.

Tang Haifeng was shocked, so were the other members of the Tang family when Gu Ning told them her total score. They knew that Gu Ning was the top student in her school, but they didn’t expect that she could get a full score.

All the members of the Tang family burst into tears of joy.

Afterwards, Gu Ning called Master Leng.

Master Leng was enjoying his breakfast along with Leng Yuanqian, his wife and Leng Yuanzhen and his wife.

“Hi, Ningning, do you want to tell grandpa a piece of good news?” Master Leng laughed once he picked up Gu Ning’s call. Master Leng was sure that Gu Ning could have a good result.

Gu Ning smiled and said, “You’re right, grandpa, but why don’t you have a guess about my total score? The full score is 750.”

“Well, I believe you can get 748 or 749 out of 750,” Master Leng said with confidence. He didn’t think that Gu Ning could have a full score, because it wasn’t likely to have a full-score essay in the exam. Actually, nobody would have that idea.

Hearing that, Leng Yuanqian snorted. Even though Gu Ning was the top student in her school, in his eyes, she could only have a total score between 730 and 740.

Leng Yuanzhen and Yu Yin were surprised by Master Leng’s guess, because they also thought that it was too high. They had never seen a senior high student who could get a total score beyond 745 in the exam before!

“Um, very close, but not right, because I have a full score in total, 750 points,” Gu Ning said. “Can I have a reward?”

Although Gu Ning didn’t lack rewards or gifts, she still wanted it from Master Leng, because it was meaningful to her.

Master Leng, however, was stunned and couldn’t say a word all of a sudden.

Leng Yuanqian noticed his reaction and thought that Gu Ning’s total score might be very different from Master Leng’s guess.

“W-What? You have a full score?” Master Leng asked.

Although 748 and 749 were only two and one points less than 750, 750 was the full score after all.

Leng Yuanzhen and the others around the dining table were astonished. They stared at Master Leng, waiting for his next sentence.

“Yes, I have a full score of 750 points,” Gu Ning said again on the phone.

“Good for you! I feel so happy for you!” Master Leng laughed loudly with happiness.

“Do I get any reward?” Gu Ning asked.

“Sure, come to see me when you’re in the capital, and I’ll give you a thick red envelope!” Master Leng beamed.

“Great, see you then!” Gu Ning said.

“See you!” Master Leng was excited.

“Father, did I hear it right? Ningning has a full score of 750 points?” Leng Yuanzhen asked Master Leng.

“Right! 750 points! A full score!” Master Leng said with a broad smile. He didn’t want to eat anymore and went back to his room to call his old friends to share this good news with them.

Master Xu and Jiang Zhongyu were greatly surprised when they heard the news, and they were also envious of Master Leng because he had such an outstanding future grand daughter-in-law. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Although their grandchildren were also outstanding among their peers, they were barely comparable to Gu Ning.
