Chapter 1719: Chu Peihan Meets Baili Zongyang

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Jing Yunyao didn’t fall asleep until it was very late again, because she kept thinking about what she had successfully remembered and what she hadn’t. She ached to get her memories back, but still failed and she would have a headache once she thought too much about the past.

She could only fall asleep at that time.

Jing Yunyao had dreams again, and they were intermittent and weren’t complete, but she was able to remember them after she woke up this time.

...

Gu Ning and other girls got up at 6 am and went to run together. Gu Ning also tested Chu Peihan’s and Yu Mixi’s fighting skills.

Chu Peihan kept a habit of exercising every day, so she had greatly improved her body condition, which was helpful for her to make progress in martial arts. And although Yu Mixi was the weakest one among them, she was still strong compared with ordinary people. She alone could defeat five men at least, and could protect herself well.

In addition, danger wasn’t everywhere.

Even though Yu Mixi could protect herself well now, she still needed to improve her fighting skills in case they came in need one day. After all, one could never be too careful.

When they were running in the morning, they met Baili Zongyang and Baili Zongxue. They exercised in the morning every day when nothing special happened, so Gu Ning would often see them.

“Wow, the man at the front has a very good build! I wonder what he looks like,” said Chu Peihan.

Gu Ning also saw Baili Zongyang, and had no intention to avoid him.

“He’s very handsome! Do you want to meet him?” Gu Ning joked, but it was also the truth. Baili Zongyang was indeed unusually handsome. However, Leng Shaoting was the most good-looking man in her eyes. Even though there were other handsome men, she wouldn’t pay much attention to them.

“Really?” Chu Peihan’s eyes lit up at once with strong interest. “Have you seen him before?”

“Yeah, I often run in the morning,” said Gu Ning.

“Um, there is a girl by his side,” said Chu Peihan.

“She’s his younger sister,” said Gu Ning.

“Wonderful!” Chu Peihan sped up to strike up a conversation with Baili Zongyang. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Gu Ning was surprised and pulled Chu Peihan back. “Seriously?”

“Why not?” said Chu Peihan. She didn’t understand why Gu Ning stopped her. She simply wanted to strike up a conversation with the man. There was nothing wrong with that!

Chu Peihan thought for a while, then said, “Did you just lie to me? Is he actually an ugly man?”

“No, I didn’t.” Gu Ning rolled her eyes. “Don’t you feel embarrassed?”

“Why? I just want to make a new friend. Why should I feel embarrassed?” Chu Peihan disliked Gu Ning for her hesitation.

“Can we not do that right now?” asked Yu Mixi. She also thought it was embarrassing if Chu Peihan went to strike up a conversation with a strange man. Chu Peihan was a girl after all, and she thought it was men’s work.

“Well...” Chu Peihan was annoyed by Gu Ning and Yu Mixi, but she had to give it up because she was afraid that they might feel embarrassed.

Although she liked strong handsome men, she wasn’t addicted to them. She wanted to strike up a conversation with Baili Zongyang simply because she was excited at this moment.

“Alright, I know them, and I’ll go to greet them, then you can talk to him,” said Gu Ning.

“What? You know them? Why did you joke with me just then?” Chu Peihan complained.

Afterwards, they ran ahead and Gu Ning greeted Baili Zongyang and Baili Zongxue when they were near. “Morning, Zongyang and Zongxue.”

Hearing Gu Ning’s voice, Baili Zongyang and Baili Zongxue turned around at once. They looked happy to see Gu Ning and also politely greeted her. “Hi, Gu Ning, what a coincidence!”

When Baili Zongyang turned around, Chu Peihan saw his face and was stunned by his outstanding appearance. This man had a good build and a good-looking face too! It was hard to find a man like him in this world!

“Are they your friends?” Baili Zongyang glanced at Chu Peihan and Yu Mixi.

“Hi, I’m Gu Ning’s friend, Chu Peihan. Nice to meet you,” said Chu Peihan at once. She also reached out her hand to shake hands with Baili Zongyang.

Actually, Chu Peihan simply wanted to take advantage of him. However, she wasn’t creepy; she just liked good-looking people.

Even though she liked handsome men, only a few men were handsome in her eyes. Currently, only her older brother, Situ Ye, Leng Shaoting, and Baili Zongyang could be called handsome.

She had met many good-looking men before, but only they were unusually handsome. She had a very high standard of a handsome man.

“Nice to meet you, my name is Baili Zongyang.”

Baili Zongyang was very polite, and shook hands with Chu Peihan although he already noticed her admiration towards him.

Baili Zongyang had countless admirers, so he was already used to their reactions when he showed up in their sight. Moreover, although Chu Peihan stared straight at him, she didn’t have any dirty ideas, so he wouldn’t dislike her. In addition, she was Gu Ning’s friend, so he subconsciously tolerated her behavior.

The second Chu Peihan’s hand touched Baili Zongyang’s hand, she felt as if she was numbed for a second as if she just had an electric shock.

They loosened their hands afterwards.

“This one is also my good friend, Yu Mixi.” Gu Ning introduced Yu Mixi to Baili Zongyang and Baili Zongxue.

“Nice to meet you.” Yu Mixi greeted them.

“Nice to meet you too.”

“My name is Baili Zongxue.” Baili Zongxue introduced herself.
