Chapter 2053: Stop Hiding It

Was it because of him that they felt embarrassed to stay in the same room?

Tang Jiakai thought that he had figured out the truth, but they actually had stayed in the same room last night. Anyway, it was Cao Wenxin and Xin Bei’s personal affairs, so he said nothing.

They stayed on the 16th floor, so Xin Bei was already waiting outside the elevator when it went down to the 12th floor. He saw them, so he went inside and exchanged greetings.

After they finished breakfast, Gu Ning arrived.

Gu Ning accompanied them today.

At 2 pm, Shangguan Yang went to meet Jing Jining in a café near the district where the siheyuan was located. In that case, even if someone was spying on Jing Jining, he could quickly get rid of the person by going back to the siheyuan.

When Shangguan Yang arrived, he noticed that someone was following Jing Jining. Because the cultivator was at a higher level than Jing Jining and there was a long distance between them, Jing Jining didn’t see the cultivator and failed to avoid him.

After that, Shangguan Yang led the cultivator away and told Jing Jining to go to the siheyuan right now.

Once Shangguan Yang took action, he never failed.

Shangguan Yang was at a very high level, so the cultivator couldn’t sense the air of cultivators from his body as long as he was five meters away.

If they were very close, the cultivator could see Shangguan Yang, but Shangguan Yang didn’t want it to happen, so he took out an object covered with magical power to attract the cultivator.

An object covered with magical power was very rare for cultivators nowadays, so the cultivator was unwilling to miss it. In addition, he felt that Jing Jining wouldn’t leave within a short time because the coffee was just placed on the table.

However, after he had been chased for a long while, Shangguan Yang made sure that Jing Jining had already left and put the magical object away so that the cultivator felt nothing all of a sudden.

At this time, the cultivator didn’t think further about that, but he subconsciously felt that he might have been trapped when he went back to the café and found that Jing Jining was gone.

However, he didn’t think it was possible because he refused to believe that Jing Jining could notice him. Even if Jing Jining knew that he was following him, how could Jing Jining be sure that he wouldn’t chase him?

He felt that Jing Jining might have sensed the magical object as well and left to search for it too!

Thinking of that, the cultivator believed it was the truth.

Since Jing Jining was gone, he could only keep looking for him. If he couldn’t find Jing Jining, he would return to the cultivation world.

Because the café wasn’t far from the siheyuan, Jing Jining arrived there within several minutes.

“How is it?” Jing Yunyao asked Jing Jining once he showed up.

“Someone is really spying on me,” said Jing Jining. Because it was within his expectations, he wasn’t very surprised.

Before long, Shangguan Yang was back.

They only needed to wait in the siheyuan till Leng Shaoting came in a while, then they would set off for the cultivation world at midnight.

Within a few days, the news about the establishment of the Shengning Organization was noticed by more and more people. Most of them admired Gu Ning’s abilities very much.

There were some who were jealous of her as well. Some even made up rumors to attack Gu Ning, but Gu Ning had many loyal fans to defend her. However, if haters did that in real life, nobody could stop them.

Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai went back to City B that afternoon because tomorrow was Monday and Tang Jiakai needed to go to school.

Although he was going to graduate, he could not be absent from classes.

Cao Wenxin wasn’t occupied. The studio she opened with her friends was managed well, so she didn’t need to be present all the time. She could stay in the capital for a few more days. Xin Bei, however, couldn’t. It wasn’t easy for him to go out for two days so he had to go back tonight.

Soldiers were very busy and they were always occupied with tasks or other jobs.

Their team wasn’t managed by any organizations or public institutions, and their head was Leng Shaoting, so they could leave as long as Leng Shaoting permitted.

And because their tasks were highly dangerous and they always risked their lives, Leng Shaoting understood them and told them to rest as much as possible when they weren’t busy. However, there were a lot of things for them to deal with recently, so Xin Bei couldn’t be absent for too long.

As a result, at about 4 pm, Xin Bei sent Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai to the airport, while Gu Ning went back to the siheyuan.

Right after Gu Ning arrived, Leng Shaoting came back.

When they were all present, they began to discuss how to participate in the kung fu competition.

They only needed to register for the competition at the event location, and it didn’t require an ID check. After leaving their names, they could get in with a number plate.

“Should Shaoting and Ningning go there as common cultivators or as Senior Shangguan’s disciples? If they go there as common cultivators, we must slide inside secretly at midnight. If they show up as Senior Shangguan’s disciples, we can go inside publicly,” said Jing Jining. After all, Shangguan Yang enjoyed a very special status. Even if the Kunlun Sect was already history, Shangguan Yang would still receive great respect in the cultivation world because of his level.

They admired the strong and there were probably no cultivators who were stronger than Shangguan Yang in the cultivator world nowadays.

It was possible, however, Jing Jining wasn’t very sure of it. There could be hidden senior cultivators who were cultivating in remote places.

Jing Jining continued, “If Senior Shangguan is going to show up, he can go inside publicly given his level and status, or it’ll be embarrassing. If not, we can quietly go inside.”

“Since we’re going there, I don’t want to hide. It’s embarrassing,” said Shangguan Yang. He had his pride, and was unwilling to hide.

“Anyway, Shaoting and Ningning won’t show up with their real faces. No one can find them after the competition, so I think we can go inside together publicly,” said Shangguan Yang. It was his opinion, but he didn’t make the decision right away. Instead, he turned to ask Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning about their opinions. “What do you think?”

“I don’t think it’s a bad idea. It can also help us avoid unnecessary trouble by going there as Grandpa Shangguan’s disciples,” said Gu Ning. Although the trouble might not be serious for them, it was better to avoid it.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
