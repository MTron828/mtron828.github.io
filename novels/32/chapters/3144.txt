Leng Xiaoyao didn’t rush to ask Li Mochen out. Instead, she sat down and drank tea with them.

“Miss Leng, do you need to have a private conversation with Mochen? Is it inconvenient if we’re here?” Once Leng Xiaoyao came and remained silent, Si Yiqi thought she might not be willing to talk with Li Mochen when they were present.

“Not at all, it’s not urgent. Let me have some tea first,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Li Mochen was struck dumb for a second. He thought there was nothing important, so he didn’t avoid his friends, but unexpectedly Leng Xiaoyao really had something to say to him privately.

“Um, do we need to go out?” Mo Jingxuan asked. Even if he didn’t know what Leng Xiaoyao wanted to say tk Li Mochen, he realized it wasn’t just about Li Mochen’s injury. Since she wanted it to be private, it must be very important.

Because he knew Leng Xiaoyao’s relationship with Li Mochen was different, he wasn’t unhappy when Leng Xiaoyao said that.

“No need, I need Brother Mochen to go out with me for a while later. It’s just an important private matter,” Leng Xiaoyao explained.

“You can go out now,” Li Mochen said at once. Since it was an important private matter that Leng Xiaoyao wanted to talk about, it wasn’t a big deal to ask Mo Jingxuan and the others to go out.

“Sure!”

None of them dared to disobey it when their head gave an order. They weren’t displeased at all and directly stood up.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care about it, but she said nothing since Li Mochen wanted them to go out. They listened to Li Mochen, so she wouldn’t embarrass him by disagreeing with him.

Therefore, she watched them leave.

When they were gone, Leng Xiaoyao said directly, “I can heal your wound and help you recover quickly, but do you trust me?”

Li Mochen was surprised and answered. “Of course.”

Leng Xiaoyao was very special in his eyes, so it was possible that she could help him recover quickly.

He also wanted to see Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities.

He believed she wouldn’t hurt him.

Leng Xiaoyao was relieved and said, “Show me your wound. Because I need to treat the wound, I will unavoidably have to touch your body. Do you mind?”

Leng Xiaoyao was aware that Li Mochen disliked touching women, so she needed to ask him about that beforehand.

“I don’t,” Li Mochen said. If other people wanted to do that, he would be unhappy, but he didn’t mind it when it was Leng Xiaoyao.

Actually, the wound wasn’t in a sensitive part, it was just on his stomach.

If the wound was in a sensitive part, he wouldn’t show it to Leng Xiaoyao.

The next moment, Li Mochen lifted his clothing and showed his wrapped stomach.

Leng Xiaoyao walked over and squatted, then unwrapped it.

Although Leng Xiaoyao didn’t touch Li Mochen’s skin yet, she touched his body through the bandages. Therefore, Li Mochen felt extremely nervous and trembled a little, but didn’t avoid her hands.

After removing the bandages, Leng Xiaoyao saw Li Mochen’s injury.

Because Li Mochen had injuries very often, he was skilled at dressing wounds and he did well this time, but he would need a long time to recover.

Leng Xiaoyao directly covered his wound with her hand. She touched his skin, so he obviously trembled again. He subconsciously leaned back to avoid her hand, but he didn’t really get rid of Leng Xiaoyao’s hand.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care about it, nor did she withdraw her hand. She immediately poured her magical power into his body to treat his wound.

The moment the magical power entered his body, Li Mochen stiffened again with surprise. He felt a flow of coldness circulating through his body, which was a feeling he had never experienced before.

Even though he understood there were unbelievable things in this world, he was still amazed when he experienced it in person.

Afterwards, the painful wound was relieved, which surprised him more.

Although Leng Xiaoyao told him she could help him recover quickly, he didn’t expect it to be so fast.

Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t heal Li Mochen’s wound completely, but 70% wasn’t a problem.

He was almost back to normal now that the wound was mostly healed. He even had a scar there.

Li Mochen was totally amazed when he saw the wound healed.

Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities were indeed beyond his imagination, but wasn’t she afraid at all when she showed her abilities to him?

“Aren’t you afraid that I’ll hurt you after knowing about your abilities?” Li Mochen asked.

He obviously wouldn’t hurt Leng Xiaoyao just because of that, but he was curious about Leng Xiaoyao’s thoughts.

“If I was afraid, I wouldn’t have let you know. What I said to you last time is really true. As long as you trust me and need me, I won’t hesitate to help you. Perhaps I owe you in the previous incarnation, so I need to return it to you in this incarnation,” Leng Xiaoyao said seriously.

It was true that she owed Li Mochen a lot, but she couldn’t tell him right now.

Though she would tell him sooner or later after there was enough trust between them.

She wasn’t afraid that Li Mochen would have bad intentions towards her. She was only worried that she couldn’t win his trust. In order to win his trust, she still needed to do a lot.

Li Mochen suddenly didn’t know what to say. After knowing that there were unbelievably strange things in this world, he didn’t doubt Leng Xiaoyao’s words, but it was impossible for him to believe it right away. He only felt it might be true.
