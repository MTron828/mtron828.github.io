Chapter 411 It Isn’t A Grave?

“I smell the stench of a corpse. Let’s go there and have a look,” Gu Ning said.

“What? A corpse?” Hearing that, they were all surprised that someone had died here, but they had seen bodies a lot of times before, so none of them were scared.

After that, Li Maosong and his friends followed Gu Ning walking over.

When they stood in front of the body and saw its face, Li Maosong, and his friends were astonished. “Zhao Laoer!”

“Why did Zhao Laoer die here?”

“Is there really an ancient grave around here? Was he killed by his partners?”

Zhao Laoer was a gravedigger too, and he must have come here for the ancient grave after he had heard the news.

“Let’s search around his body,” Gu Ning said. Although she had already found the black hole, she couldn’t tell them right away in case it would arouse their suspicion.

Hearing that, they immediately started to search around, while Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see what was inside the black hole.

The black hole was three meters ahead of the body, and there was a big rock blocking its entrance. Normally people wouldn’t know that there was something unusual about it.

The black hole was over a dozen meters deep, and it almost reached the bottom of the temple. At the end of it, there was a chamber which was five square-meters big, but it was empty.

Maybe other gravediggers had already taken all the stuff inside, so there was nothing left in it. However, no other tunnels were extending from the chamber. Was it just a normal grave? However, if it was a normal grave, there should be a coffin! Gravediggers wouldn’t steal a coffin.

Gu Ning looked deeper with her Jade Eyes and saw that something was wrong with the chamber. There was another chamber next to the wall of this chamber. And the wall was only a meter thick.

Although the second chamber was also empty, Gu Ning saw that a grave tunnel extended from it. It seemed that the first chamber was just a cover, and the gravediggers who had come here before them hadn’t known that there was more just next to the wall.

While nobody was looking, Gu Ning secretly moved the rock away and a third of the hole showed. “Oh, look! Here is a hole!” Gu Ning said like she just found it.

Li Maosong and his friends ran over at once and moved the rock together before he used his flashlight to look inside.

“This is a grave hole,” Li Maosong said.

“Let me get in first, and you can follow behind me,” Gu Ning said, then climbed into the hole. Everyone agreed. Gu Ning led the team so that she could protect them if anything bad happened. Gu Ning had promised to do so after all. When they climbed into the hole, Gu Ning told the last person to move the rock back to cover the hole to prevent others from finding it.

The hole was straight and was only a meter tall, so they had to squat when they were inside.

Gu Ning took out her night-luminescent pearl, and the black hole was lit up at once. Li Maosong’s and his friends’ flashlights became useless then.

Seeing Gu Ning’s night-luminescent pearl, Li Maosong and his friends were impressed again. However, they had no intention to steal it.

No person was 100% good or bad. It was illegal that they dug ancient graves, and it showed that they weren’t good people, but they wouldn’t murder others and knew how to be grateful. In that case, they were good people to some extent.

It all went well as they walked to the chamber, but there was no tunnel ahead.

“Well.”

“There is no tunnel?”

“Isn’t this a grave?” Li Maosong and his friends were quite disappointed.

Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes and saw nothing dangerous in the second chamber behind the wall, so she asked Li Maosong and his friends, “Do you trust me? I have an idea.”

They were struck dumb for a second, but they all knew that Gu Ning was talking about this grave. No matter what Gu Ning was going to do, they would follow her.

“Miss Gu, I’m willing to follow your lead no matter what you’re going to do next,” Li Maosong said. They now all regarded Gu Ning as their leader, and they would follow her lead, even if it was risky.

“Me too!” The other three men echoed.

“Very well.” Gu Ning was satisfied. She then pointed at the wall before them. “Dig through that wall.”

“No problem.” They didn’t ask why, but took out tools and started to dig without delay. The four men were divided into two shifts to dig through the wall.

At the same time, Leng Shaoting called Gu Ning when he was free, but no one answered.

Leng Shaoting thought that Gu Ning must have gone to find the ancient grave, and he was worried. However, all he could do was wait until Gu Ning called him back.

Half an hour later, the one-meter thick wall was dug through. Li Maosong and his friends were very surprised when they discovered the second chamber. They couldn’t believe that Gu Ning was just lucky, but they knew that it wasn’t appropriate for them to ask further. If Gu Ning said that she only relied on her luck or instinct, then so be it.

However, the hole was too small for a person to get through, so Li Maosong and Zhao Jiangquan kept digging till the hole was big enough.

Another half an hour later, the hole was big enough for a person to crawl through.

There was no need to make a large hole, as long as it was big enough for them to get through.

This time, Gu Ning still moved in the front. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

A short while later, they arrived at the second chamber. It was cold and damp inside because it had been closed for a long time, but there was no rotten smell in it like the last ancient grave.

The second chamber was empty, but there were grave tunnels at both sides. There would be the front door and the third chamber at the ends of the two grave tunnels.

“Let’s see which one is connected to the chamber,” Li Maosong said, and moved to the right grave tunnel, while Sun Chao moved to the left one.

Gu Ning, instead, directly used her Jade Eyes, and saw that the front door was on the left side, while the third chamber was on the right side. Nevertheless, she wouldn’t say it of course.

This grave consisted of three chambers, and people had to move through the second chamber to the third one.

“Let’s go to the right one!” Gu Ning said.

After a few minutes, they arrived at a rock door. “Let’s open it!”

“Sure,” Li Maosong said and went to push the rock door. Unfortunately, it was too heavy.

“Let me do it.” Gu Ning walked forward, and Li Maosong stepped aside.

Gu Ning pushed the door with her normal strength but failed. Thus, she used her power and improved her strength.
