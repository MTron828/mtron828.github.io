Chapter 1126 Teach You a Lesson

Given Leng Shaojia’s bad relationship with Xu Qinyin, she actually didn’t bother to pay much attention to Xu Qinyin, but she still got jealous that Gu Ning could have a good relationship with Xu Qinyin, who came from a super-rich family. She simply didn’t want Gu Ning to be better than her.“Gu Ning, I just saw a beautiful gown. Why don’t you come and have a look for me?” Xu Qinyin directly talked to Gu Ning and ignored Leng Shaojia.

Xu Qinyin didn’t know whether Leng Shaojia was aware that Gu Ning was Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend, but she knew that Leng Shaojia would hate Gu Ning anyway.

Although she hated Leng Shaojia, she knew it wasn’t appropriate for Gu Ning to have conflict with members of the Leng family right now. However, what Xu Qinyin didn’t know was that Gu Ning already had conflict with members of the Leng family.

“Wait a second.” Leng Shaojia stopped Gu Ning at once. “You should apologize to me.”

“Apologize to you?” Gu Ning was surprised. “Why?”

“You didn’t show respect to me, so you should apologize to me,” Leng Shaojia said with arrogance.

This reason sounded very ridiculous, because it was Leng Shaojia’s subjective feeling.

“I don’t think it’s reasonable,” Gu Ning said. She was unwilling to waste time arguing with Leng Shaojia, but it was obvious that Leng Shaojia wouldn’t let her go without humiliating her.

“I said you should apologize to me, so you should apologize!” Leng Shaojia said in a domineering tone.

“Are you crazy or something?” Gu Ning frowned.

At this moment, their argument attracted some attention from other people in the store. Yu Zi and Zi Beiying walked over as well.

“What’s going on here?” Yu Zi asked.

“Not a big deal. I can handle it,” Gu Ning said.

Since Gu Ning said that, Yu Zi didn’t ask further.

Afterwards, Gu Ning said to Leng Shaojia, “Miss Leng, please don’t bring our personal grudge to a public place. You’ve already made yourself a joke, and you are affecting the business here. If you keep challenging me, I won’t mind teaching you a lesson outside.”

Gu Ning was afraid that Leng Shaojia might damage Charm’s business.

“You...” Leng Shaojia didn’t know what to say, nor do right now. She was worried that Gu Ning would really beat her. She knew that she was no match for Gu Ning. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Shaojia, let it go,” Zhu Jinling said.

“Fine, I can forgive you this time, but don’t do it again, or you can’t bear the result!” Leng Shaojia said and gave herself an out.

After that, Leng Shaojia left with Zhu Jinling. Zhu Jinling didn’t want to leave right away, but she had to follow Leng Shaojia.

...

“Who’s that woman?” Zi Beiying asked.

“A member of the Leng family,” Gu Ning said.

Knowing that, Zi Beiying nodded.

“Does she know that you’re Shaoting’s girlfriend?” Zi Beiying asked. She didn’t know the conflict Gu Ning had with some members of the Leng family.

“She knows,” Gu Ning said. “Alright, it isn’t important. Have you found any beautiful dresses you like?”

Zi Beiying understood that Gu Ning was reluctant to talk about this topic, so she dropped it at once.

“I do like the gowns here, and I chose two sets, but one of them doesn’t fit me, so I need a customized gown,” Zi Beiying said with excitement.

She didn’t care about a brand’s fame, instead all she cared about was it’s designs. In addition, she believed that the brand could become an international brand.

“I can send each of you a set as a gift, but I need to charge you for the second,” Gu Ning said to Zi Beiying and Xu Qinyin. Zi Beiying and Xu Qinyin were her friends after all.

“You don’t need to do that. We can pay you,” Zi Beiying said. She knew that Gu Ning was very generous, so she didn’t turn her kindness down.

“Right, we can actually pay you, but thanks for your generosity,” Xu Qinyin said.

Both of them knew that Gu Ning wouldn’t take their money if they didn’t accept her kindness. They were more than willing to pay for the second gown.

“It’s not a big deal, and you can pay for the second dress,” Gu Ning said with a smile.

...

After Zhu Jinling and Leng Shaojia left Charm for a short distance, they heard a conversation between two young women who walked by them.

“Wow, I’m so excited that Charm finally opened!”

“I wonder whether Goddess Gu will come today.”

“I hope she can come so that I can see her in real life.”
