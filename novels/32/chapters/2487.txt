Chapter 2490 Gu Ning Is Also a Cultivator

The fact that Yunyao returned was bad news to the other major families. After all, she was too strong

Yunyao was very impressive seventeen years ago, so she might be even more powerful right now.

Besides, she destroyed the zombies this time, which was really shocking! Although Yunyao refused to use her original identity, her existence was still very helpful for the Leng family. To be honest, Yuan Wenye didn’t think that Yunyao lied about her experience of losing her memories after getting injured, but he agreed with Du Zhenghan that it was best to conduct an investigation about it.

He wanted to deliberately make some problems when Du Zhenghan conducted the investigation, but Du Zhenghan told him about Wei Lingfeng’s warning, so he didn’t insist.

If he dared to do that, he would be in serious trouble once it was exposed.

Du Zhenghan also told Yuan Wenye that Wei Lingfeng warned them not to tell more people about the zombies. Yuan Wenye understood how serious it was, so he had no intention of spreading it abroad.

However, he would leak the news that Yunyao was still alive to the Rong family and the Chang family.

As for the purpose, he hoped that they would do something after finding out.

“Yunyao, do you have anything to deal with in a while?” Master Leng suddenly asked.

“Nope,” said Jing Yunyao. “Why don’t you go back to the Leng family’s house and have dinner with me? We can chat,” said Master Leng.

“Of course,” said Jing Yunyao. She was more than willing to comfort Master Leng right now, because he badly needed it.

Afterwards, they went back to the Leng family’s house, but didn’t go inside. Instead, they walked to the gazebo in the yard.

Spring had already passed, so the weather wasn’t that cold. It was even sunny today, and they felt warm under the sun.

When there were only the two of them, Master Leng asked, “Does Ningning know that you are cultivators?”

“She does. I couldn’t say much when we were with the president, but since you’re aware that Shaoting and I are cultivators now, I think I can tell you more about that. In fact, Ningning is also a cultivator, that’s why she has a special medicine with unbelievable effects. That medicine isn’t something that exists in the mortal world,” said Jing Yunyao. She couldn’t tell Wei Lingfeng everything, but Master Leng was her family. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Knowing that Gu Ning was also a cultivator, Master Leng was surprised. It turned out that Gu Ning was a cultivator as well!

“How about Ningning’s parents? Are they cultivators too?” Master Leng asked. If cultivators were born with the talent, could Gu Ning’s parents be cultivators?

“No, Ningning’s parents are both mortals. Ningning became a cultivator by chance,” said Jing Yunyao. She couldn’t give him more details.

“Oh!” Master Leng barely knew about cultivators, so he believed Jing Yunyao’s explanation.

Jing Yunyao didn’t dare to tell Master Leng that she actually caused Leng Yuanhan’s death. As a cultivator, she shouldn’t have gotten together with a mortal, but she broke the rule. That was why her father was determined to kill him.

She always felt guilty about it. Especially after she regained her memories, she felt as if it had just happened yesterday. She couldn’t get over

it.

“Since you’re a cultivator, you shouldn’t be an orphan, right?” Master Leng asked. Jing Yunyao used to tell them that she was an orphan and the Leng family believed that.

If it wasn’t the truth, she must be hiding something from them.

Master Leng wanted to know the truth.

Speaking of her family, Jing Yunyao looked upset at once. She could control her emotions, but she didn’t bother to do that in front of Master Leng. “My mother passed away when I was little. I have a father, but he treated me badly. My step-mother and her children bullied me. I wasn’t skilled at cultivation back then, so they refused to play with me. I had to work hard on it till I made great progress. After that, my father made full use of me, but I was reluctant to be used, so I ran away.”

Hearing that, Master Leng’s heart ached for her. “Well, let bygones be bygones. You already left the family, and now the Leng family is your family. No one will bully you here.”

Jing Yunyao was deeply touched, because she could feel that the Leng family treated her very well.

Some members in the Leng family didn’t get along with her, but that wasn’t important.

“Um, I can’t interfere in your work. I want to respect your decision, but you and Shaoting must protect yourself first no matter what crises you encounter in the future. Do you understand?” Master Leng gave a heavy sigh.

He couldn’t stop it from happening, so he had to face it and could only hope that everything would go on smoothly.

As soldiers, it was their responsibility to fight back danger for the country even if they had to risk their lives, but it wasn’t easy for Master Leng to accept it when it happened to Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao.

He had already lost a son. He didn’t want to lose his grandson and daughter-in-law too.

“Of course, I promise,” said Jing Yunyao. Even if Master Leng didn’t say that, she would still take care of herself. She wouldn’t joke with her life.

Hearing Jing Yunyao’s reply, Master Leng felt much better, but it would still take some time for him to completely accept it.

Yuan Wenye deliberately leaked the news that Yunyao was still alive to the Rong family and the Chang family, so they soon heard about it. However, they weren’t fully convinced because they hadn’t seen her in person yet.

Anyway, if Yunyao was really alive, it would be terrible news for them.

They had no idea about the zombies, but they had heard about what Yunyao had achieved before.

In order to verify it, the two families sent out people to get more information.

Afterwards, they learned that Master Leng took Yunyao to Wei Lingfeng’s office at about 3 pm today. They failed to find out the reason why yet, but they were sure that Yunyao was indeed still alive.

They also suspected that Yunyao “died” for a purpose, so they conducted an investigation about it too.

If there was a purpose, they could find fault with the Leng family.

Yunyao was the Leng family’s daughter-in-law, so if she made any mistakes, it would be the Leng family’s fault.
