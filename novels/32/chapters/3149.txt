3150 Bad People Speak Louder

“Defame? Do you think you have a good reputation?” Shi Yuran mocked Leng Xiaoyao first, then turned to An Chenmeng and Xiong Manxin. “And you, I’m not talking to you. You should shut up!”

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t have a good reputation in the past, but she was totally different now. If it wasn’t something she did, she wouldn’t allow other people to defame her.

“You should shut up!” An Chenmeng was mad.

Leng Xiaoran was annoyed by Shi Yuran’s words, but didn’t lose control of herself. She stayed as calm as usual. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

!!

After all, she wouldn’t forget her manners just because of that.

“It’s my business whether I have a good reputation. You have no right or power to judge me. Who do you think you are? Do you think you all are good girls? It’s a small circle, and we all know what kind of people you are. Don’t pretend to be innocent after you did so many bad things. I don’t care about you at all, but you shouldn’t defame me,” Leng Xiaoyao said mockingly and warned them. “Tell you what, I’m not weak at all. If you want to bully me, you better prepare to bear the result.”

They pretended to be innocent after doing many bad things?

The other guests agreed with Leng Xiaoyao on that. Shi Yuran and her friends honestly disgusted them.

They made things difficult for other people first, but blamed other people for that instead. It was unacceptable!

Shi Yuran and her friends were immediately angry.

“What did you say? How dare you say that we’re pretending to be innocent? You’re the bi*ch here!” Shi Yuran roared, clenching her teeth.

Huang Junyan also shouted angrily. “Do you want us to bear the result? Who do you think you’re? Can your family do that?”

“Leng Xiaoyao, don’t think too highly of yourself,” Mo Jinbei said. The more arrogant Leng Xiaoyao was, the more she disliked her.

“So what? It’s you who caused trouble first. Why should I tolerate it? Do you think you can do anything you like? Do you think you own this world and that everyone must listen to you? In your dreams!” Leng Xiaoyao mocked them. “It’s Master Mo’s birthday party. I don’t want to argue with you, but if you dare to bully me again, I won’t hesitate to teach you a lesson.”

“So?” Shi Yuran didn’t want it to end just like that. She wasn’t afraid of Leng Xiaoyao, so she threw the wine in her glass at Leng Xiaoyao.

The other guests were all shocked, but before they realized what was happening, Leng Xiaoyao fought back and knocked the glass back at Shi Yuran.

The next moment, the wine was poured all over Shi Yuran’s face. Shi Yuran was shocked. Seeing that, the other people rounded their eyes in shock. Looking at Leng Xiaoyao, they had respect for her.

Leng Xiaoyao reacted so fast!

No one criticized Leng Xiaoyao, because they all knew Shi Yuran and her friends caused trouble first. It was their fault, not Leng Xiaoyao’s.

In fact, they disliked Shi Yuran and her friends more than they were jealous of Leng Xiaoyao. Therefore, they were very pleased when Shi Yuran was taught a lesson.

“Ah!” Shi Yuran screamed after coming back to her senses, and attracted more attention. More and more people walked over, including the Mo family.

It was the Mo family’s party, so they should obviously come over to have a look if anything went wrong.

“Yuran, are you alright?” Huang Junyan immediately went to check on Shi Yuran.

Mo Jinbei turned to angrily criticize Leng Xiaoyao. “Leng Xiaoyao, you’re so rude!”

She was rude?

It was Shi Yuran who wanted to pour the wine on her. She simply fought back and the wine was poured back on Shi Yuran.

If Leng Xiaoyao didn’t do that, she could have been covered with the wine.

She only protected herself. Why was it rude?

Leng Xiaoyao gave Mo Jinbei a glare. Mo Jinbei was scared and stiffened at once.

Leng Xiaoyao looked so scary!

“I’m rude? I think you’re the rude ones! Everyone saw it. You can’t deny it,” Leng Xiaoyao said coldly.

“You…” Mo Jinbei was struck dumb for a second and didn’t know what to say. Leng Xiaoyao was right, so she panicked when Leng Xiaoyao put pressure on her.

“What’s going on here?”

At this moment, the Mo family’s eldest son walked over.

The moment he saw the wine on Shi Yuran’s face and body, he was displeased.

Because Mo Jinbei and her friends were notorious for their bad behavior, the Mo family’s eldest son understood that it must be Mo Jinbei who caused the drama.

In that case, he wouldn’t defend Mo Jinbei just because she was his niece. Instead, he needed to educate her more strictly.

She caused a scene at their own family’s party, which was embarrassing.

“Uncle Mo, Leng Xiaoyao poured wine on me!” Shi Yuran blamed Leng Xiaoyao for it right away.

Upon hearing that, An Chenmeng was furious. Before Leng Xiaoyao even said anything she immediately retorted. “Ridiculous! You tried to pour the wine on Xiaoyao first. Xiaoyao simply raised her arm to protect herself and the wine was knocked back to you.”

“Right, don’t pretend to be innocent after you tried to hurt other people! It’s you who made things difficult for us. Xiaoyao tolerated it because we didn’t want to cause a scene, but you didn’t stop and even tried to pour wine on her!” Xiong Manxin added at once. Her face was distorted in anger.

“You’re so shameless to pin the blame on Xiaoyao!” Wu Minmin was so angry that she almost couldn’t finish the sentence.

“You…” Shi Yuran was struck dumb and didn’t know what to say.

People who didn’t know the reason realized what had happened after looking at Shi Yuran’s expression. It turned out that she and her friends caused the girl trouble first. She was indeed shameless to put the blame on Leng Xiaoyao.

How could they be so shameless?

Other people who weren’t shameless didn’t know their thoughts.

The Mo family’s eldest son was even angrier. He knew it must be Shi Yuran’s fault, but he was still surprised by her shamelessness.
