Chapter 2041: Shocked Again

The Cao family was based in City B, but it was a large dominant family, so many people had heard of it and were shocked by its presence.

Not everyone knew that Tang Yunrong had married into the Cao family, so they had no idea that Gu Ning had a relationship with the Cao family because of the Tang family.

Not only the Cao family, but the Lei family and several other super-rich families along with senior officials from City B also showed up. They all sent over expensive flower baskets and waited in a line, which shocked the other guests again.

Although those representatives of the super-rich families and senior officials from City B came for the sake of the Tang family, because they knew that Gu Ning was Tang Yunfan’s daughter, other people in the capital had no idea about that. Therefore, they believed that they came for Gu Ning.

“Gu Ning’s connections are in every industry! She knows so many members of high society.”

“Yeah, they all have a very high social status. It’s amazing!”

“…”

Although those families weren’t comparable to the Leng family, the Xu family, or the Tang family, they all belonged to the high social class. Other people could barely see them, but Gu Ning was able to have a relationship with them.

As a result, they were amazed again after the presence of the Leng family, the Xu family, and the Tang family.

Afterwards, the He family from HK, and the Ye family from City M showed up, which shocked everyone once more.

Even Gu Ning was greatly surprised because she didn’t share the news with the He family and the Ye family.

Anyway, since they came, they must have found it out on their own.

They knew her corporation was being formally established today, but didn’t tell her that they were coming. Instead, they quietly sent people over with flower baskets and gifts to congratulate her, which made Gu Ning feel touched.

“Jesus, Gu Ning has a relationship with the He family from HK and the Ye family from City M as well?”

“Is it really happening?”

They weren’t doubting it, but it was too unbelievable to be true.

“Of course it is! No one dares to fake that. It’s not necessary for Gu Ning either. After all, the Leng family and other powerful families also have a close relationship with Gu Ning.”

“Right, I’m curious how Gu Ning managed to form a relationship with the He family from HK and the Ye family from City M? It’s quite unbelievable.”

Many people thought that Gu Ning was able to build up an extraordinarily successful business empire relying on dirty tricks, mainly by selling her body for resources. However, given the status of those guests, only idiots would still hold that idea!

All those important guests didn’t welcome dirty tricks and no one would doubt their influence. Therefore, Gu Ning must have her own abilities. If not, none of those powerful families would be willing to help her.

That was also the reason why ordinary people couldn’t be accepted by them.

In fact, most people believed that Gu Ning had outstanding abilities because they all had experience in workplaces. Without outstanding skills, it was impossible for one to build up a business empire by completely relying on his or her connections.

After a while, senior managers of the Qinghua Organization and the Heiqi Organization came too.

People who didn’t know Gu Ning’s connection with the two corporations were surprised again, while those who were aware of that felt nothing because the two corporations had shown up at the opening ceremony of Gu Ning’s other businesses before.

Because of Qi Tianlin’s and Situ Ye’s special background, they didn’t come in person, otherwise it might cause Gu Ning unnecessary trouble.

If people learned that Gu Ning had a relationship with the Qing Gang and the Kirin Gang, it might arouse suspicions.

Although it wasn’t uncommon that businessmen had a relationship with illegal gangs, they always kept it secret.

If anyone dared to make it public, other people would become suspicious of them. After all, illegal gangs had done countless bad deeds, so it might arouse suspicion that whoever had a relationship with them were involved in illegal actions as well.

Gu Ning had a relationship with the Qinghua Organization and the Heiqi Organization, but it didn’t mean that she had a relationship with the Qing Gang and the Kirin Gang too because the Qinghua Organization and the Heiqi Organization were doing legal business. Even if they were owned by illegal gangs, people were willing to accept that. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Besides, there were many senior officials, it wasn’t suitable for them to show up as the heads of illegal gangs.

Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye didn’t show up in public, but they did come.

Qi Tianlin arrived earlier than Situ Ye. He stopped his car far from the crowd. He didn’t get out of the car, but just opened the car window to look in the direction of Gu Ning.

The moment he saw Gu Ning, his eyes became tender, but he frowned when he saw Leng Shaoting next to her. He turned to coldly stare at Leng Shaoting.

Qi Tianlin didn’t know Gu Ning’s relationship with Leng Shaoting, so he thought that they simply knew each other, but he had a few grudges against Leng Shaoting. Although they weren’t arch enemies, he was reluctant to see him. Once they met, they would unavoidably compete with each other.

Qi Tianlin was cruelly domineering, but he had reason, so he wouldn’t attack Leng Shaoting in public. After all, it was illegal to attack a soldier.

As the head of an illegal gang, he had broken the law many times, but he had done that in private and didn’t dare to make it public. Therefore, even though he hated Leng Shaoting, he did nothing and only coldly stared at him.

As soon as Qi Tianlin’s eyes turned cold on Leng Shaoting, Leng Shaoting felt it.

Because Qi Tianlin didn’t avoid staring at Leng Shaoting with hatred, it was hard not to discover it. Qi Tianlin’s look was unkind, but wasn’t threatening.

Accordingly, Leng Shaoting didn’t bother to avoid it and turned to look behind him, then he found Qi Tianlin in the car.

Seeing Qi Tianlin, Leng Shaoting slightly frowned. He was surprised that Qi Tianlin would come in person.

Leng Shaoting actually was unhappy to see Qi Tianlin as well because he knew that Qi Tianlin had special feelings towards Gu Ning. Anyway, he didn’t care much about it because Gu Ning wouldn’t choose Qi Tianlin even though Qi Tianlin liked her.

Since Leng Shaoting was able to feel Qi Tianlin’s look, Gu Ning who wasn’t far away from him could also feel it. She turned around and was surprised to see Qi Tianlin.

She couldn’t welcome him right now, so she only gave him a nod as a greeting.

Qi Tianlin gave Gu Ning a gentle smile. He didn’t do it on purpose, but it was with sincerity.

Leng Shaoting felt jealous seeing Qi Tianlin’s look at Gu Ning, but he could do nothing now, so he felt a little aggrieved.

Gu Ning was busy treating other guests, so she didn’t have time to take care of Leng Shaoting’s mood.
