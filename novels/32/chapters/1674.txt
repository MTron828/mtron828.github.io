Chapter 1677: Leng Yunhan Proposed to Yunyao

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Yunyao met Leng Yuanhan after knowing me, and it was about half a year later. It was summer and I went back home again for the summer vacation. Leng Yuanhan was home that time too, so we hung out together. There was a funny drama when Yunyao met Leng Yuanhan for the first time. Back then, a woman who liked Leng Yuanhan kept harassing him and even publicly said that they already had a sexual relationship. Yunyao was a girl with a strong sense of justice, so she stood up and beat Leng Yuanhan for the woman. Luckily, Leng Yuanhan wasn’t seriously injured, and Yunyao also found it was just a misunderstanding later. She apologized to Leng Yuanhan and he forgave her.”

As Peng Yunlong told the old stories, pictures of the scenes flashed by Jing Yunyao’s eyes.

“Yunyao and Leng Yuanhan got along well with each other, and I honestly was a little jealous, but I refused to admit that I already fell in love with her. When Yunyao became Leng Yuanhan’s girlfriend, I realized that I made a wrong decision, but it was too late.”

Gu Ning was surprised when she heard that Peng Yunlong had admired Yunyao before, but didn’t think it was impossible.

Jing Yunyao, however, felt slightly embarrassed, because she lost her memories and felt a little strange when Peng Yunlong said that he had admired her before.

“We had a trip in Province Y once, and we coincidentally met a group of soldiers who were in the middle of a mission. They were going to catch a bunch of drug-dealers, and we joined them when they were about to lose the fight. During the shooting, a violent drug dealer pointed his gun at Yunyao and Leng Yuanhan didn’t hesitate to protect her from being hurt by the bullet. He almost died that time, and Yunyao became his girlfriend afterwards. I knew I had to hide my affection towards Yunyao in my heart from that time.”

Hearing that, Jing Yunyao suddenly felt heart-broken and even cried. She turned her head away at once because she didn’t want them to see her crying, but she failed.

Gu Ning pulled out tissues at once and put them in Jing Yunyao’s hands.

Jing Yunyao wiped her eyes right away.

Peng Yunlong continued, “Leng Yuanhan proposed to Yunyao after they had dated each other for a year, and he also bought a beautiful manor for her.”

He kept on telling many romantic stories about Leng Yuanhan and Yunyao, but unfortunately Jing Yunyao couldn’t remember them clearly.

“Where is the manor now? Is it still there?” asked Gu Ning.

If it was possible, they could go there.

“No idea, because I didn’t go there again after Leng Yuanhan and Yunyao had the accident. Maybe Shaoting knows it’s address,” said Peng Yunlong.

In that case, they could only ask Leng Shaoting.

“General Peng, you just said that your younger cousin is my friend. May I know her name?” asked Jing Yunyao.

“Her name is Peng Shiyin, but she already passed away because of cancer five years ago,” said Peng Yunlong. He still felt sad whenever he thought of that.

Jing Yunyao also felt upset when she heard the bad news.

“Well, do you know where her grave is? Can I visit her grave?” asked Jing Yunyao.

Since Peng Shiyin was her friend, she thought that she should go to see her. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Peng Yunlong then told Jing Yunyao the address of Peng Yunlong’s grave.

After that, they were going to leave. Gu Ning said to Peng Yunlong, “General Peng, please keep the fact that Yunyao is still alive a secret. She doesn’t want more people to know before she gets her memories back.”

“No problem.” Peng Yunlong agreed.

Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao left later.

When they were gone, Peng Yunlong was lost in thought for a long time.

Jing Yunyao was in a sad mood as well and Gu Ning didn’t bother her.

It was 5 pm now, so they directly went home.

They planned to visit Peng Shiyin’s grave tomorrow.

On their way home, Gu Ning received a call from Shangguan Yang. Shangguan Yang asked her whether she was very busy these days, and Gu Ning denied it, then he complained. “If you’re not busy, why don’t you come to see me? I’m alone every day!”

Even though Shangguan Yang could do many things alone, he hoped that someone could talk with him sometimes.

Lao Zhang and Stone didn’t have common interests with him, and they always showed great respect to Shangguan Yang because of the difference in their status, which made Shangguan Yang feel bored. Therefore, once Shangguan Yang had time, he tortured Stone by teaching him fighting skills.

Luckily, Stone was a retired soldier and had a strong build, so he was able to accept the tough training. Within a few days, his fighting skills were greatly improved and he began to enjoy Shangguan Yang’s lessons.

“I’m sorry, Grandpa Shangguan. I’ve been occupied by a very important thing these days. Can I go to see you for dinner tomorrow if I’m free at that time?” said Gu Ning.

Shangguan Yang was satisfied and agreed.
