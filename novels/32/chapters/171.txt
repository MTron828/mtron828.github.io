Chapter 174 No. 520 Private Room

As it showed, Leng Shaoting wasn’t simple at all.

The minute Wang Renkang stepped inside he put on a pleasing smile. “Miss Gu, nice to meet you. I’m the vice leader of this police station, Wang Renkang. I’m so sorry for what you’ve been through. You may leave right now, and please allow me to send you back to school.”

Wang Renkang was being very polite, so Gu Ning treated him kindly too. “It’s fine. I don’t need you to send me to school. I don’t feel aggrieved either, but I want it to end in the correct way, not just because of the power.”

Then, Gu Ning gave Wang Renkang a piece of paper. Wang Renkang immediately took it.

Gu Ning added, “Although you didn’t question me, I’ve already written down everything. You can go check it. I know I shouldn’t have beaten them, but I only did it to protect my cousin.”

Wang Renkang read through it. He knew that Gu Ning was telling the truth.

From the perspective of the law, Gu Ning only needed to pay the administration fee, but the director had ordered to let her go, Wang Renkang didn’t dare to let Gu Ning pay the fee. At the same time, Wang Renkang was also astonished that Gu Ning was able to kick a person several meters away. This girl is so amazing!

“I don’t want anyone to bully my cousin from now on, especially Xia Jiaojiao. Please call their principal and let him be aware of that. As far as I’m concerned, the principal tends to protect Xia Jiaojiao.”

Wang Renkang of course understood Gu Ning’s aim. Du Haiping, the principal of the No. 4 Middle School, protected Xia Jiaojiao for the sake of Xia Mingshan. As for Du Haiping’s behavior, Wang Renkang actually could understand it. He would do the same thing when facing power.

They would always stand with the more powerful one. Like what was happening now. Gu Ning was the more influential one, and they naturally tended to please Gu Ning. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“No problem, I’ll call him later,” Wang Renkang answered. He was going to threaten the principal in fact.

“Oh, as for Xia Mingshan, I hope he can spend more time on educating his child. Students should focus more on studying. Do not hurt others out of impulse. If it happens again, it won’t end as easily as it did today,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure,” Wang Renkang answered.

Gu Ning then left, followed by Wang Renkang.

She saw the three young policemen who had brought her to this police station the minute she walked out of the trial room. They appeared panicked.

“I told you that it’s not up to you whether I will be safe. You better obey the rules and the laws the next time. If it happens again, you can’t bear the result,” Gu Ning said to them before she walked away.

She wasn’t threatening them, but just reminded them. If they continued to do what they did, they would be in trouble soon.

Those policemen felt ashamed, and learned their lesson. They were also grateful that Gu Ning didn’t punish them.

“Miss Gu, it is 2:10 pm now. I suppose you need to attend your classes. Please allow me to send you to your school,” Wang Renkang asked in an extremely polite way.

“No, thanks. Someone will pick me up,” Gu Ning replied coldly, walking straight out of the police station.

A black Land Rover stopped right at the roadside. Leng Shaoting got out of the driver seat. Seeing that Gu Ning was safe, he was relieved. Even though he knew that she would be fine, he felt worried.

Gu Ning walked to him, and Leng Shaoting immediately opened the door of the passenger seat for her. At that time, Gu Ning noticed that the man was wearing a pair of slippers. She was quite surprised.

Leng Shaoting flushed a little explaining, “I was in a hurry.”

“Ha-ha,” Gu Ning couldn’t help laughing out loud, but she was touched. He had forgotten to change his shoes. He must have been super worried.

Leng Shaoting felt embarrassed, and immediately changed the topic. “Are you alright?”

“I’m fine. Let’s go now!” Gu Ning got in the car. Leng Shaoting closed the door, going back to his driver seat and left.

Wang Renkang watched the car disappear from his sight and finally relaxed. After that, he called Xia Mingshan and Du Haiping without delay and told them what Gu Ning had told him.

Both Xia Mingshan and Du Haiping felt frightened. No one dared to say another word.

As for the hospital administration fee, Xia Mingshan would pay it himself. After all, Feng Xiaoyu and Zhang Yanlin were hurt because of Xia Jiaojiao.

Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting to take her back to school. Then she called Jiang Xinyue. Luckily, Jiang Xinyue was fine too.

Gu Ning hung up turning to Leng Shaoting. “Thanks for what you did!”

“My pleasure,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Let’s have steak this afternoon. I don’t feel like eating seafood anymore.” Since Leng Shaoting had helped her, she decided to treat him better.

“Sure.” A smart man like Leng Shaoting, he obviously understood why Gu Ning suddenly changed her mind. He was happy in his heart.

On the way, the two didn’t talk much. They were in a hurry, so Leng Shaoting drove fast, but steadily. It normally took 20 minutes, but they arrived after 15 minutes.

Gu Ning stepped out of the car, saying good-bye to Leng Shaoting before she ran into her school. Fortunately, she got back to her classroom on time.

During the break, Gu Ning called Gu Man and told her that she was going to dine with her friends this afternoon, and wouldn’t be eating at home.

When the afternoon classes were finally over, Gu Ning took a taxi to a western restaurant where Leng Shaoting had a reservation. She didn’t want to cause any rumors, so she didn’t allow Leng Shaoting to pick her up.

The appointed time was at 6:30 pm. Gu Ning left her school at 5:50 pm, and it took at least 30 minutes to get to the downtown by taxi. It was the rush hour now, and she had to spend more time on the road. Meanwhile, Leng Shaoting arrived much earlier at 5:30 pm.

When it was almost 6 pm, Gu Ning received a message from Leng Shaoting. They would dine together in the No. 520 private room.
