ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Master Song told Song Miaoge to go back together with Gu Ning. Song Miaoge’s mother was fine now, and they would stay in the hospital, so Song Miaoge didn’t need to be worried and she could go back to finish her military training.

Although her family had encountered trouble, Master Song still didn’t want Song Miaoge to be absent from class when it was not necessary.

Song Miaoge was reluctant to leave, but she listened to her grandfather and left with Gu Ning.

Now that her mother was fine, she felt much more relieved.

Master Song arranged for their chauffeur to send them back to school, and Gu Ning accepted it.

“Don’t worry! Your mother will be fine.” As they walked out, Gu Ning comforted Song Miaoge.

“Gu Ning, thank you.” Song Miaoge thanked Gu Ning. Although she had already thanked her just now, Gu Ning had done her family a huge favor.

“We are friends. You don’t need to thank me,” Gu Ning said.

Song Miaoge felt so lucky to have met Gu Ning. She lived in the same dorm room with Gu Ning, and also became close friends with her. Otherwise, her mother would have been in danger this time.

“Gu Ning, if you need us in the future, don’t hesitate to let me or my family know. We won’t spare any effort to help you,” Song Miaoge said.

In the ward just now, her grandfather asked her what they should give Gu Ning to thank her for the great favor.

However, Gu Ning lacked nothing, so Song Miaoge felt that they could owe Gu Ning a favor. If Gu Ning needed them in the future, they could try their best to help her, and Master Song agreed.

When they were talking about that, Gu Ning heard it. Although she never thought of asking for anything in return, Gu Ning agreed on what Song Miaoge proposed, because she was not sure whether she would need their help in the future.

She didn’t know the specific social status of the Song family yet, but it was obviously not an ordinary family.

Originally, she simply made friends with Song Miaoge, so she didn’t bother to learn about her family background. However, Gu Ning thought it was better for her to know more right now. At least she should know which faction the Song family belonged to.

If she was from the Rong family, Yuan family, or Chang family, then she would not be able to have a close friendship with Song Miaoge, nor would she keep in touch with her family.

Therefore, Gu Ning sent a message to K, asking him to help her collect information about the Song family.

Although she didn’t know the names of other members in the Song family, she saw Song Miaoge’s mother’s operation chart when she was in the operation room, so she knew Song Miaoge’s mother’s name. It would be easier to learn more about the Song family through Song Miaoge’s mother.

When Gu Ning and her friends returned to their school, it was almost 6 pm. It was time for dinner. Song Miaoge then invited Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue to eat in the restaurant outside their school.

Although Song Miaoge didn’t have much appetite, she still forced herself to eat in case it affected Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue’s appetite.

Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue understood, but it depended on Song Miaoge to accept the result after they had done their best to comfort her.

After having the meal, they went back to their school.

There were many more students in the Capital University today, because in a few days, the senior students would also return for the new semester. As a result, students from other places came to the school a few days in advance.

When those senior students saw Gu Ning, many of them couldn’t help but pay more attention to her.

Gu Ning also heard several boys talking about them.

“I feel there are so many new beautiful girls this year! I’ve already seen many of them.”

“Yeah, but the one in the middle over there looks more attractive.”

“I somehow think the beauty in the middle is a bit familiar. I must have seen her somewhere before, but I suddenly can’t remember.”

“Come on, you say that every time you see a beautiful girl!”

“I really think she looks familiar!”

“...”

Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue were with Gu Ning. Gu Ning was always more eye-catching and they were used to it. They didn’t feel displeased or jealous, because they both agreed that Gu Ning was more attractive than them.

As for the boy who said that he felt Gu Ning looked familiar, they didn’t think he said it every time he saw a beautiful girl. He either had really seen Gu Ning somewhere before, or he might have read news about her on the Internet. After all, Gu Ning had a lot of fame on the Internet.

“Do you need to have a rest in the dorm room?” Gu Ning asked Song Miaoge. Now that she was in a bad mood, Gu Ning wouldn’t force her to keep training.

“Gu Ning, sorry, I’m in no mood to train today. Can we continue to train tomorrow?” Song Miaoge said. She wouldn’t stop training for the competition against Ji Wenna, but she was really not in the mood today.

“Sure,” Gu Ning replied.

After that, Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue accompanied Song Miaoge back to the dormitory.

Song Miaoge didn’t go to the evening class, and stayed in the dormitory the entire time.

Back in the dormitory, Gu Ning also received a message from K. He told her that the result had been sent to her email-box.

Gu Ning then opened her email-box to read the new email.

Song Xiangrui, Song Miaoge’s grandfather, was once Leng Weihua’s subordinate, the commander of the Southern Theater Command with the rank of lieutenant general.

Song Jinghua, Song Miaoge’s father, now served as a political commissar and major general in the Southern Theater Command.

Jiang Jiarong, Song Miaoge’s mother, was the deputy director of the Public Security Bureau in the western district of the capital.

Song Miaoge’s uncle and aunt also held significant positions in politics.

The Song family’s status in the capital was quite high.

Coincidentally, Jiang Jiarong was also Jiang Zhongyu’s niece.

The Song family belonged to the Leng family’s faction.

When Gu Ning learned that, she breathed a sigh of relief, because she had a good impression of Song Miaoge and she was quite willing to make friends with her. From the bottom of her heart, she was still reluctant to be her opponent.

If they belonged to opposite factions, before Song Miaoge knew it, maybe they could get along well, but it was impossible for them to become close friends even though they might still be friends after she learned about it.

Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue stayed with Song Miaoge in the dormitory for a while. When it was time for the evening class, they left for their own class.

Rong Jue had already told their instructors about Gu Ning and Song Miaoge’s going to the hospital. They all expressed understanding and sympathy for such a terrible accident, especially for Song Miaoge.

Therefore, when Song Miaoge was absent for the evening class, the instructor of their class didn’t say anything about it.

In the evening class, they either studied military songs, or the instructor would talk about some interesting things in the barracks. At this time, the instructors weren’t so serious.

Therefore, the students were less afraid of their instructors and made jokes with them, which was a good way to build their relationship.

During the evening class, the instructor asked Gu Ning whether she was willing to tell them how she began to start up her companies.

Gu Ning agreed, but she told the truth combined with some lies.

Gu Ning told them that she had a kung fu master as her teacher when she was little, so she had learned many skills from him.
