Chapter 1593: Ms. Shen

“It’s demolition, and they want to forcefully completely destroy another person’s house,” Gu Ning said.

“What? That’s evil!” Shangguan Yang frowned.

Leng Shaoting also felt displeased, so he decided to do something.

“Wait a second.” All of a sudden, Shangguan Yang stopped Leng Shaoting.

“What’s wrong?” Both Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were confused.

“I smell a cultivator from the crowd,” Shangguan Yang said.

Hearing that, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were struck dumb for a second. Gu Ning asked, “Is the cultivator a member of the Good Practice or Evil Practice?”

“The Good Practice,” said Shangguan Yang.

“Great, why don’t you wait here and I’ll go over and have a look,” Gu Ning said.

“Why?” Shangguan Yang showed confusion.

“I don’t want other people to know that you two are cultivators. Since there is a cultivator in the crowd, it’s safer for you to stay in the car,” Gu Ning said.

“Alright.” Shangguan Yang agreed.

“Grandpa Shangguan, can you see the cultivator’s level?” Grandpa Shangguan asked.

“Hard to say before the person takes action, but I’m sure this cultivator’s level is much higher than Shaoting,” Shangguan Yang said.

“Great, Shaoting, move your car back as far as you can in case the cultivator smells you,” Gu Ning said before she stepped out of the car.

“Sure,” Leng Shaoting said and drove the car backwards.

Afterwards, Gu Ning walked to the small restaurant.

At the front of the restaurant, two groups of people stood opposite each other. In one group, each of the six attendants of the small restaurant had a mop or broom in their hands, and there was a woman with a mask standing in the middle of them.

In another group, about 20 strong men each had a wood stick in their hands. They seemed to be hired roughnecks.

There was a man in his early forties standing in the middle of them and he was staring at the woman with a mask. “Ms. Shen, you better not start a fight and sign the agreement right now!”

The woman who was called Ms. Shen said, “Even if you want this land, you should offer me a reasonable price.”

“I own this piece of land, and it isn’t small. I have also built a five-story building here, and it’s worth at least six million yuan. How can you only offer three million yuan for it? It’s ridiculous!”

Ms. Shen wasn’t dumb, the man simply wanted to take advantage of her.

Gu Ning sneered when she heard that.

The man was really greedy and he wanted to buy a piece of land with half of its price.

It was understandable if a land developer wanted to buy a piece of land and destroy the old buildings on it, but a reasonable price was needed. No resident was willing to move without a reasonable offer.

Gu Ning focused on Ms. Shen for a while, then realized that she was the cultivator. However, Ms. Shen had a mask on her face, so Gu Ning couldn’t see her face.

Gu Ning didn’t want to use her Jade Eyes to see Ms. Shen’s face, because it was disrespectful. She had no conflict with Ms. Shen after all.

“Right, three million yuan is too little!”

“This building and land are worth a lot more than that.”

“He’s a greedy businessman.”

“Businessmen are all greedy.”

“He can’t do that!”

“...”

Onlookers began to talk about it in a low voice and they all hated the man’s behavior. However, none of them dared to stand out against the man.

The man ignored those onlookers and said to Ms. Shen, “Ms. Shen, I don’t have patience with you, so you should make your decision right now.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Give me six million yuan, or you can leave now,” Ms. Shen said. She was unwilling to give in.

Three million yuan sounded like a lot in a small town, but this land had a great location, and it was worth much more than three million yuan. In addition, Ms. Shen could make a lot of money here by running her small restaurant, so she was actually reluctant to move.

In her eyes, six million yuan wasn’t enough either. However, she had the plan to move out of here, so she considered the price of six million yuan.

“Six million yuan? Impossible!” The man was mad.

Although he had six million yuan as the budget, he didn’t want to give Ms. Shen all of the money because he planned to take some from it.
