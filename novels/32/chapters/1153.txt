Chapter 1155 Play Mahjong During Working Hours?

It was obvious that this girl sided with the construction workers and she had the power to make the decisions here.“He went to play Mahjong during working hours? That’s insane!” General Supervisor Chen was mad at once.

Supervisor Zhang always did a good job in front of him, so he didn’t pay much attention to him, but it turned out that Supervisor Zhang was negligent in supervising this construction project.

General Supervisor Chen blamed himself for this mistake.

Zhang Shun was scared when General Supervisor Chen was mad, and he didn’t dare to side with his uncle now.

“Does it often happen?” Gu Ning asked the young man.

“Yeah, we rarely see the supervisor these days,” the young man said.

Hearing that, General Supervisor Chen was even angrier. A supervisor should keep a close eye on the construction project, otherwise he didn’t deserve such a high salary.

“We can’t keep him. General Supervisor Chen, please directly fire Supervisor Zhang and Zhang Shun, and I’ll talk to Chairman An later,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure,” General Supervisor Chen said. Even if Gu Ning didn’t give that order, he would still fire Supervisor Zhang. He didn’t understand why Gu Ning wanted to fire Zhang Shun as well, but he knew that Gu Ning had to be doing it for a reason.

The other people were all delighted when they heard that both Supervisor Zhang and Zhang Shun were fired, because nobody liked them.

“M-Miss Gu, please give me another chance! I promise I won’t do it again!” Zhang Shun begged Gu Ning in a hurry. He got paid a higher salary here, so he was unwilling to leave. Besides, he wasn’t well-educated, and it wasn’t easy for him to find another good job.

Gu Ning, however, ignored him and turned to look at the young man. “You can stay, and the others should go back to work.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The young man then stayed and the other people all walked away.

“General Supervisor Chen, please take Zhang Shun to finish the legal procedures for his dismissal,” Gu Ning said to General Supervisor Chen.

“No problem. Miss Gu, please feel free to tell me if you need me to do anything for you,” General Supervisor Chen said before he left with Zhang Shun.

Zhang Shun was reluctant to leave, but he was left no choice.

“Miss Gu, may I help?” the young man asked, feeling nervous when he was alone with Gu Ning.

“What’s your name?” Gu Ning asked. She had a good impression of this young man.

He should be studying in a school at his age, but he was doing physical work here. There had to be a reason for it.

Gu Ning told him to stay in order to find out more about him. She had a strong feeling that this young man was very promising, and Gu Ning believed in her feelings. If she didn’t have that feeling, she wouldn’t waste much time on a stranger.

“My name’s Yuan Mao,” Yuan Mao answered.

“How old are you?” Gu Ning asked again.

“I’m 19.” Yuan Mao didn’t understand why Gu Ning asked that, but he still answered her questions.

“You’re 19? You’re supposed to study in a school at this age. Why are you already making a living?” Gu Ning asked.

Yuan Mao instantly looked upset, but soon composed himself. He didn’t want other people to think that he was weak.

Gu Ning knew that he ached to study from his expression, but he couldn’t do that because of some difficulties. She was right.

“I’m in 12th grade this year and I should be attending the National College Entrance Examination, but my father was caught in an accident two months ago. He was the only breadwinner in my family, so I had to quit school and support my family by working here,” Yuan Mao said. Although he wanted to keep on studying, his family mattered more in his eyes.

“How’s your performance in your grades?” Gu Ning asked.

“I’m always among the top 20 in my grade,” Yuan Mao said with pride, then wore a resigned look. He was proud of himself because he was very academic. However, no matter how good he was at studying, he had to give it up.

Knowing that, Gu Ning was slightly surprised. She didn’t expect that Yuan Mao was an excellent student in his school. In that case, it would be a shame for him not to finish his education.

“Well, have you ever thought about what major you will choose if you can get into a university?” Gu Ning asked.

Yuan Mao was confused when Gu Ning kept asking him questions about his studies. He was unwilling to talk much about it because he felt sad every time he thought of it. Nevertheless, Gu Ning was the boss, so he had to answer her questions.

“Building design I think,” he said.

“Can you tell me why?” Gu Ning asked.

Yuan Mao stopped for a second, then continued, “Um, my father used to be an architect, and I learned a lot from him, but a man stole a design from my father several years ago and even slandered my father. Because the man has a powerful family as support while my family is very ordinary, my father failed to get his design back and his reputation was also ruined in the industry. My father couldn’t work as an architect any longer, so he had to earn some money at construction sites.”

Saying that, Yuan Mao felt like crying.

Gu Ning nodded after hearing the story.

No matter what level Yuan Mao’s father was at as an architect, his father must be outstanding since his father could become an architect. Yuan Mao had also learned a lot from his father, which meant that he was better than his peers in this industry. His father had to quit this industry, but he still chose to join it, which proved his determination.

“Well, if you can keep studying, do you still want to major in building design?” Gu Ning asked.

“Of course.” Yuan Mao blurted it out, but soon lowered his head. “I don’t think it’s possible though.”
