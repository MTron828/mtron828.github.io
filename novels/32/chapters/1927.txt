Chapter 1929: There Is a Solution to This Problem

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After they went inside, they picked up the tickets and went in through the security check. Because they were going abroad, it took time to pass customs so they didn’t have much time to stay outside.

None of them had any luggage, they each just brought a small bag. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting used their backpacks to cover their magical spaces. It would be strange if they brought an empty bag when they passed the security check, so Gu Ning put a mobile phone charger and a few small things such as cosmetic products in her bag.

Leng Shaoting had a mobile phone charger and a change of clothes in his bag too. Xu Jinchen did the same thing.

Forty minutes after passing customs, they started boarding.

Because they booked the plane tickets right before the departure time, the first class was no longer available and they could only book seats at the back rows in the economy class. Luckily, their seats were in the same row.

.

Gu Ning was sitting by the window, Leng Shaoting was sitting in the middle, while Xu Jingchen was sitting by the aisle.

The plane took off on time. After a six-hour flight, the time that they would arrive at City J International Airport in Southeast Asia was 5:20 am. The plane still needed to park for a while, so it was 5:30 am when they finally got off the plane, and by the time they finally walked out of the airport, it was another 20 minutes later. After all, the airport was relatively large, and they needed to walk a long distance to leave.

Although it was almost dawn, there were still many people who came to pick up their friends or family members at the airport, but the number was far smaller compared to during the daytime.

When Leng Shaoting and the others reached the exit, they saw Zi Shaomin in the crowd. Although he disguised himself very well with sunglasses and a peaked cap, Gu Ning and the others still recognized him at first sight.

Zi Shaomin didn’t know that Gu Ning was also here. He thought that only Leng Shaoting and Xu Jingchen would come, because usually only the two of them showed up when they came to City J to deal with something. Therefore, Zi Shaomin was slightly surprised to see Gu Ning. However, he welcomed Gu Ning as well.

“Hi, Miss Gu, welcome to City J.” Zi Shaomin greeted Gu Ning with enthusiasm, leaving Leng Shaoting and Xu Jinchen aside.

They were very close, so there was no need for him to exchange courtesies with them. Neither Leng Shaoting nor Xu Jinchen would mind it.

“Nice to see you, Mr. Zi,” Gu Ning politely replied.

“Let’s go! We can talk after we’re out of here,” said Zi Shaomin.

After that, three of them followed Zi Shaomin out.

A car was parked outside the hall, so as soon as they walked out, they got into it.

Zi Shaomin came to pick them up alone, so he was the driver.

“Did you come for ammunition or for something else?” Zi Shaomin asked once they were in the car, “Have you booked rooms yet? Do you need me to do that for you?”

“We’re not here for ammunition, we heard the Zi family has encountered some trouble these days. So we came to see if there is anything we can do to help,” said Leng Shaoting.

“What?” Hearing that, Zi Shaomin was amazed. “Are you already aware of that?”

Although he asked a question, he actually knew the answer. He didn’t tell Leng Shaoting the bad news because he didn’t want to bother him. Unexpectedly, they still came to help, which made him feel quite touched.

“Yeah,” said Leng Shaoting in a flat voice.

“Mr. Ze, please forgive us for coming here without invitation,” said Gu Ning. Then she explained. “It might be a sudden visit, but Beiying is a good friend of mine. I really want to help her after hearing what has happened to her. I talked with Shaoting about it because you and Shaoting are friends too. The Zi family is also our country’s ally in regards to ammunition, so he must do something.”

Gu Ning knew Zi Shaomin wouldn’t blame them for coming here without being invited. In fact, he felt quite grateful to them. His reaction said everything.

“Of course I won’t blame you for that! I feel quite honored and grateful for your kindness and help!” said Zi Shaomin.

“Alright, stop the courtesies. How’s the situation now?” Xu Jinchen interrupted their courtesies at once. He was worried about Zi Beiying now.

Talking about that, Zi Shaomin looked upset. “Now the transaction and freight to Country Y has been temporarily stopped, so we’ve suffered a great loss. Luckily, there is no problem with the transaction and freight to other countries. We can continue our normal cooperation. After all, Charles’s abilities are limited, otherwise the Zi family would have already been ruined by him.”

“How were you ambushed?” Gu Ning asked.

“Someone waited there, or directly mixed into the crowd who’s responsible for receiving the goods, then directly bombed the goods. Because they learned that the people who bombed the goods weren’t on their side, the responsibility fell on our shoulders. Only after we completely hand over the goods will the accident have nothing to do with us,” Zi Shaomin said.

It was Charles’s actions, so their business partners who had no idea about it were also hurt. And because the Zi family knew that they were Charles’s target and their business partners were innocent, they didn’t blame them at all. Instead, they felt guilty about it.

Not only had the Zi family suffered a great loss, but its business partners had also lost a lot of money. After all, they needed to sell the goods to other people just like the Zi family.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Fortunately, they had cooperated with the Zi family for so long, so they didn’t vent their anger on it. However, for the time being, they needed to stop cooperating with the Zi family and turn to other munitioners.

“I had a call with Beiying. She told me the traces left by those ambushes all point to a big family in Country Y. She also told me it’s impossible for you to deal with the family in Country Y right now because of the internal problems in the Zi family,” Gu Ning said.

“Right.” Zi Shaomin said, “There is another possibility which is that Charles might have reached an agreement with the family. If so, even if we go to see them, they might give us a perfunctory answer and won’t do anything to really help us. By then, we can do nothing about it.”

It was highly possible, because it had happened many times before.

Gu Ning pondered over it for a while, then said, “Well, it’s not easy to find evidence to prove that Charles has something to do with that, but there is a solution to this problem.”

“What is it?” asked Zi Shaomin and Xu Jinchen in a hurry. Leng Shaoting also turned to look at Gu Ning waiting for her further explanation.

They, especially Leng Shaoting and Xu Jinchen, all knew Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl, so she must have a good idea since she said that. And in most cases, her ideas worked.
