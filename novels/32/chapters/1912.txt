Chapter 1914: Clasp the Pole and Dance

“No? It’s not up to you now,” said Gu Ning coldly, then went to Ji Wenna. Ji Wenna’s friends subconsciously moved forward to protect her.

Gu Ning squinted. “Miaoge, Zongxue, get them out of my way.”

Hearing that, Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue came to grab Ji Wenna’s friends so that they could barely move.

At this moment, no one could help Ji Wenna.

“Y-You...” Ji Wenna was really terrified. She turned around trying to escape, but it was impossible in Gu Ning’s sight. The second she raised her foot, Gu Ning caught her.

The next second, Gu Ning dragged her to the dressing room. When she walked by Zhang Zikai, she told her to take out the camera, which was prepared by Gu Ning.

Ji Wenna had one too, but Gu Ning didn’t want to use hers.

“Let me go. Let me go!” Ji Wenna struggled in vain.

“Let Wenna go!”

“Let her go!”

Ji Wenna’s friends shouted as well.

“Mind your own safety now! None of you can help Ji Wenna,” said Baili Zongxue mockingly. These people were really stupid in her eyes.

Baili Zongxue seemed naive in front of Gu Ning, but actually she could be very cruel in front of her enemies or those who made things difficult for her.

If it was possible, she preferred to post the video on the Internet to make it big news later. Ji Wenna asked for it herself after all.

If Song Miaoge lost today, she didn’t think Ji Wenna would be kind to Song Miaoge.

After Gu Ning dragged Ji Wenna to the dressing room, she asked her for the last time, “Do you want to change by yourself, or do you need me to do it for you?”

Gu Ning looked quite terrifying, making Ji Wenna feel stressed.

“I...” Ji Wenna gave in. Although she was reluctant to accept this result and couldn’t wait to tear Gu Ning into pieces, she knew that she was doomed today.

After a while of silence and being threatened by Gu Ning, Ji Wenna took the bikini and unwillingly walked into the dressing room.

“I don’t have much patience, so you better not stay inside for over 5 minutes. Otherwise you can stay totally naked!” Gu Ning threatened.

Ji Wenna was shocked, but didn’t dare to dawdle again. Besides, she didn’t have her phone with her, so she couldn’t call for help.

Although she often wore swimwear at the swimming pool or by the sea, this was a bikini which could barely cover her body!

Because she intended to humiliate Song Miaoge, the bikini she prepared showed a lot of skin.

Now she was left with no choice, so she yielded. Nevertheless, she was determined to pay Gu Ning back.

Ji Wenna finished changing, but refused to go out. When the 5 minutes were almost over, Gu Ning coldly said, “Only half a minute is left. If you don’t get out now, I’ll...”

Before Gu Ning could finish, Ji Wenna walked out, because she was afraid Gu Ning would really make her totally naked.

When Ji Wenna walked out, she used her original clothes to cover her body, and had her hands on her chest.

Ji Wenna glared at Gu Ning once she was out, but didn’t dare to say anything. If she could kill people with her look, she would definitely kill Gu Ning right now. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Be quick! It’s not early now. We still need to celebrate later,” said Gu Ning on purpose to annoy Ji Wenna. Ji Wenna was almost driven crazy, but could do nothing because she was no match for Gu Ning.

Seeing Ji Wenna dawdling, Gu Ning pulled off the clothes she used to cover her body. In an instant, she was left only in a bikini.

The two boys at the scene immediately turned their heads away, not because they didn’t want to see it, but because they didn’t dare to do it.

Ji Wenna had a perfect body with large boobs and ample ass, especially when her big breasts were more than half out of the bikini.

“You...” Ji Wenna was as angry as she was embarrassed when Gu Ning pulled off the clothes she used to cover her body, and she used her hands to cover her chest at once.

After that, she felt her lower body needed to be covered too, so she freed a hand to cover it, but she could barely cover her body.

“Well, well, you have quite a sexy body. I bet a lot of men must be in love with you.” Zhang Zikai complimented, which was the truth.

“I think yours are good too,” Song Miaoge said after a glance at Zhang Zikai.

“All of us are sexy,” said Baili Zongxue. She wasn’t narcissistic, but all of them indeed had an attractive body.

“I agree,” said Zhang Zikai.

“Alright, don’t waste our time.” Gu Ning pulled Ji Wenna to the pole.

The second Ji Wenna walked out, Zhang Zikai started recording.

After Gu Ning pulled Ji Wenna to the pole, she told Zhang Zikai to give her the camera because she would do it on her own.

Gu Ning pointed the camera at Ji Wenna. Seeing her standing still she snapped, “Clasp the pole!”

Hearing that, Ji Wenna unconsciously held the pole, but didn’t move at all.

“Dance now!” said Gu Ning.

Ji Wenna felt utterly humiliated, but she had to dance a little. Her dance had nothing to do with pole dance.

Gu Ning didn’t ask Ji Wenna to do a standard pole dance, but took a video of her embarrassment to let Song Miaoge have something on her.

Ji Wenna kept avoiding the camera, but Gu Ning wouldn’t let her do that, so Ji Wenna showed her face in the camera most of the time.

Filled with anger, Ji Wenna didn’t dare to say a word.

Gu Ning didn’t record long, a minute was enough.

“Alright.” Gu Ning turned off the camera. Coldly staring at Ji Wenna, she said, “Ji Wenna, I won’t upload the video to the Internet for the time being, but you should stop causing Miaoge trouble, or you’ll bear the consequences on your own.”

Ji Wenna felt relieved, but it was hard for her to submit to the humiliation and give up on paying Song Miaoge back.

She wasn’t only going to pay Song Miaoge back, she was also determined to punish Gu Ning. In fact, she ached to kill Gu Ning right now. If it hadn’t been for Gu Ning, she wouldn’t have been humiliated so badly.

Anyway, she wouldn’t say it aloud now.

“Let’s go!”

Gu Ning didn’t care whether Ji Wenna listened to her and left with her friends.

If Ji Wenna wanted to pay Song Miaoge back, Gu Ning would help Song Miaoge. After all, if she hadn’t stood out, Song Miaoge might have given in when Ji Wenna tried to use the Rong family’s influence to scare them.

She didn’t regret doing what they had done today, because she wouldn’t give in to Ji Wenna.
