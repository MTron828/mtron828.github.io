After the meal, it was already 4 pm. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Gu Ning checked the plane tickets back to City F, because Leng Shaoting had just arrived in City F, and she missed him. She had finished the deal in City D anyway. However, there were no plane tickets going to City F right now, and the last one would take off in half an hour. Gu Ning couldn’t catch it, so she could only wait till tomorrow.

She then decided to stay in the Quanlin Resort, and K generously paid the fee for Gu Ning.

After K left, Gu Ning decided to take a walk around the Quanlin Resort. Quanlin Resort was surrounded by beautiful mountains and lakes with a beautiful, natural view. It was indeed a pleasure to stay here.

Gu Ning took a photo and a selfie with the view, sending it to Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting had just wanted to call Gu Ning when he received her message.

Gu Ning beamed in the photo, and Leng Shaoting’s heart lost a beat. He wanted to kiss her, now.

Leng Shaoting: Where is this place?

Gu Ning: Quanlin Resort. It’s so beautiful.

Leng Shaoting: I see.

Then they stopped texting.

After 45 minutes, Gu Ning was about to go back. She turned around, and noticed a familiar figure walking towards her. Gu Ning was stunned.

Leng Shaoting? Why is he here? Gu Ning rubbed her eyes to check whether it was real, but the man was still approaching her.

“Why are you here?” Gu Ning asked. It felt so unreal.

“I missed you, so I came here.” Leng Shaoting stood in front of Gu Ning, staring at her. There was obvious loneliness and deep love in his eyes. Leng Shaoting wasn’t a man who loved to say sweet nothings, but he was a doer. Gu Ning almost cried. He missed her so much that he couldn’t wait for a day.

She had the same feeling actually. She knew that Leng Shaoting was in City F, and she was eager to fly back to his side, but she failed to catch the last plane.

“Let’s have a tour around!” Gu Ning said.

“Sure,” Leng Shaoting said.

Gu Ning held Leng Shaoting’s hand naturally.

Leng Shaoting’s body stiffened unconsciously. He wasn’t used to it yet, because it was the first time they had been so close. He of course loved the feeling, and immediately clasped Gu Ning’s hand in his big palm, as if he was afraid to lose her.

The two walked for a while longer, then took a break on the bench.

“Let’s take a photo together!” Gu Ning said.

Leng Shaoting was a little anxious, because he wasn’t accustomed to taking selfies.

Gu Ning sat near Leng Shaoting raising her phone, and took a picture of them sitting together. Gu Ning beamed, while Leng Shaoting remained expressionless, but both of them looked beautiful in the picture.

Within a second, Gu Ning finished taking the picture.

The two matched each other so well in the photo.

“Send it to me,” Leng Shaoting said.

This was the first photo of them, and he would carry it with him. Whenever he missed her in the future, he could look at the photo.

“No problem,” Gu Ning said, and immediately sent it to him.

She focused on their faces in the photo for a long time with excitement.

When it was almost 6 pm, Gu Ning asked Leng Shaoting, “What do you want to have for dinner?”

“Up to you,” Leng Shaoting said.

Gu Ning wasn’t hungry yet, but Leng Shaoting flew all the way from City F, coming to her. He could be starving now.

“Let’s go to the restaurant first!” Gu Ning said.

They then walked to the restaurant.

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning met a group of people at the door of the restaurant. To Gu Ning’s surprise, she was familiar with the leading two men.

Yan Zhenglin was here and the man beside Yan Zhenglin was Jiang Bowen who she had just met today. What a coincidence!

“Girl Gu, what are you doing here?” Before Gu Ning could say a word, Yan Zhenglin already saw her and was apparently excited. He strode to Gu Ning without delay.

Jiang Bowen was astonished by the scene instead. Do they know each other? Obviously, they knew each other, and they seemed very close. Are they relatives?

“Uncle Yan, what a coincidence! I came to City D to deal with something. How about you?” Gu Ning asked.

“Me too!” Yan Zhenglin said. He then said to Leng Shaoting, “Nice to meet you, Mr. Leng.”

“Nice to meet you too, Mayor Yan,” Leng Shaoting nodded to Yan Zhenglin.

“Oh, Miss Gu and Master Yan are friends?” Jiang Bowen walked over.

“Nice to meet you, Mayor Jiang,” Gu Ning said to Jiang Bowen.

“What? You two know each other too?” Yan Zhenglin asked. He was shocked that Gu Ning could always get to know importance figures wherever she came.

“The girl I told you about today is Miss Gu,” Jiang Bowen said.

“What? It was you?” Yan Zhenglin rounded his eyes in astonishment. He had already heard of what had happened to Xiao Changchun. To his astonishment, the girl who had stabilized the car was Gu Ning. However, he knew that Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl, so he believed that Gu Ning was able to do that.

Leng Shaoting looked to Gu Ning with doubts.

Gu Ning panicked a little, because she didn’t want to worry him.

Leng Shaoting noticed Gu Ning’s small reactions, and he had a sense that she must have done something he wouldn’t be happy to know about.

“Girl Gu, you indeed surprise me!” Yan Zhenglin said.

It had been so dangerous, and she could have fallen too! She had indeed risked her own life, but luckily, both Xiao Changchun and Gu Ning were fine now.

“Master Yan, is Miss Gu your relative?” Jiang Bowen asked.

“Not really, she’s a good friend of my father, and my lifesaver. I told you the story last time,” Yan Zhenglin said.

“What?” Hearing that, Jiang Bowen was more than shocked. Gu Ning was the girl who had saved Yan Zhenglin’s life from the sniper’s shot? Jesus! This young girl is truly amazing!

Gu Ning, instead, felt slightly embarrassed to see them being shocked.

Noticing that, Yan Zhenglin immediately dropped the topic. “Girl Gu, are you here to have dinner? Let’s dine together!”.
