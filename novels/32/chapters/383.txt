Chapter 384 Rescue Yuan Jisong

Otherwise, in the highly conservative past, she wouldn’t have had sex with Ning before marriage and even given birth to his child. During the past 18 years, she had never thought to marry another man. Although it had ruined her reputation because she was pregnant before marriage, there had been other men who had proposed to her, but she had turned them down. Thus, Gu Man indeed loved Tang Yunfan deeply.

Although she thought what Gu Ning had said wasn’t likely to be possible, she couldn’t help hoping it was true. She wasn’t sure whether she would still have the same affection towards Tang Yunfan now like she had loved Ning in the past, but Tang Yunfan was the only man she had loved throughout her lifetime. He was her child’s father, so she hoped that he could have a good life; even if he was already married and had his own family now. The next day when Gu Man got up, she had quite obvious dark circles.

Gu Ning felt sorry for her mother, but they had to face it sooner or later. After all, Gu Man still loved Tang Yunfan and Tang Yunfan was also missing her, which was the reason why he wasn’t willing to get married. They had fallen deeply in love with each other and had a baby in the past. If Gu Man would choose a man to spend the rest of her life with, Gu Ning hoped that the man was Tang Yunfan.

Gu Ning massaged Gu Man and used her magical power to relieve Gu Man’s fatigue. Gu Man was going to visit her friend, Wang Sufen, today. Wang Sufen was the one who had sent Gu Man to the hospital when Gu Man had fainted at work.

Gu Ning told Gao Yi and Qiao Ya to follow Gu Man today, because they were both free, while Gu Ning went on a date with Leng Shaoting. The two didn’t know what to do today, so they simply ambled on the road. Even so, they enjoyed being together.

“Ningning,” Leng Shaoting called her.

“What?” Gu Ning replied.

“Ningning,” Leng Shaoting called her again.

“What?” Gu Ning looked at Leng Shaoting with confusion.

“Nothing just wanted to call your name,” Leng Shaoting said.

Gu Ning was amused and teased. “Does my name sounds very beautiful?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Of course it does,” Leng Shaoting said with sincerity.

“Well, go on then!” Gu Ning said.

“Ningning!” Leng Shaoting called once more, and Gu Ning laughed.

The two walked to the government center and the view was quite pleasant. There was a large park with trees and stone trails. Many citizens would come here to have a walk.

At that moment, a government car stopped in the parking lot in front of an office building. Two men got out of it afterward. Gu Ning recognized one of them at first glance. The man was the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee in City F, Yuan Jisong. And he was followed by his secretary. However, when they had just gotten out of the car, a crazy man with a knife in his hand dashed out from nowhere and yelled, “Yuan Jisong, go to hell!”

Yuan Jisong was shocked still, so was his secretary and the people around them. However, right as the knife was about to touch Yuan Jisong’s chest, a person ran over like lighting and kicked the crazy man away. With a sharp sound, the knife cut through Yuan Jisong’s clothing over his chest. There was an open cut, but luckily the knife didn’t hurt the skin.

Gu Ning was the person who kicked the crazy man away in time. And once the crazy man was kicked away, Leng Shaoting went ahead and caught him.

“Let me go! Let me go!” The crazy man struggled violently, but Leng Shaoting got complete control of him, and he could only yell like a maniac.

The crazy man’s yell aroused Yuan Jisong and his secretary’s consciousness. Yuan Jisong could barely stand straight; he could have been killed just then. The secretary was scared too, but he wasn’t the killer’s target, so he was soon able to move. “Are you alright, Mr. Yuan?”

“Ye-yes.” Yuan Jisong’s voice was trembling, and he was still frightened, but he tried his best to calm down. Meanwhile, nearby security guards ran over at once and took the crazy man from Leng Shaoting’s hands. However, the crazy man kept shouting, “Yuan Jisong, I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you now! If it hadn’t been for you, I wouldn’t have been dismissed!”

After taking a few deep breaths, Yuan Jisong calmed himself down and looked to the man coldly. “If you hadn’t behaved illegally, you wouldn’t have been fired! You’ve asked for the result yourself, so you can’t blame others for that! Take him away now.”

The security guards instantly took the crazy man away.

After that, Yuan Jisong turned to Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. He bowed and thanked them with sincerity. “Thank you so much for saving my life!”

“Mr. Yuan, please don’t say that. We’re glad that you’re safe,” Gu Ning said.

Yuan Jisong was an upright official. If he had been a corrupt official, Gu Ning wouldn’t have helped him. Although there were no people who were 100% good in this world, as long as he did his job well, he was a qualified government worker.

“You’ve saved my life so you’re my life-saver!” Yuan Jisong said. He didn’t think that others should serve him just because he had a high social status. If Gu Ning hadn’t kicked the crazy man away in time, he would have been killed or severely injured.

Yuan Jisong took a name card out of his pocket and gave it to Gu Ning. “This is my name card. If you encounter any trouble in the future, you can call me for help, but it has to be legal.”

“Thanks!” Gu Ning, of course, wouldn’t reject it. “Mr. Yuan, what just happened will certainly go abroad soon. Please don’t expose me to the news. I don’t want to attract a lot of attention.”

Gu Ning was modest, kind and kept a low profile, which left a good impression on Yuan Jisong.

“Sure,” Yuan Jisong said. He would respect her wants. And then they separated.

As for what Gu Ning had done in such a dangerous situation, Leng Shaoting didn’t blame her but clasped her hand. He was still worried about her safety. Although he knew that Gu Ning was good at kung fu, he still cared about her more than anyone

else.

The news that the Secretary of Municipal Party Committee, Yuan Jisong, had almost been stabbed went viral on the Internet soon.
