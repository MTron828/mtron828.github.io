Chapter 2298: Why Didn’t You Kill Yourself?

Although Miao Jingjing regained consciousness, she wasn’t completely conscious yet. She didn’t know that Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao came and even rescued her. Therefore, as soon as she woke up, she subconsciously thought that she might have been killed. She encountered a bitter enemy after all. It was impossible for her to survive.

However, she suddenly found magical power in her body. Obviously, someone helped her circulate it.

Abruptly, Miao Jingjing opened her eyes and saw Gu Ning in front of her as well as the evil cultivator who injured her.

Instantly Miao Jingjing realized what was happening. She was rescued by Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao. It was Jing Yunyao who was helping her circulate the magical power inside her body.

Miao Jingjing felt relieved.

Because Jing Yunyao was circulating the magical power in her body, Miao Jingjing ignored the gathered magical power stored in her lower abdomen.

Seeing that Miao Jingjing had woken up, Jing Yunyao stopped.

“How do you feel now?” Jing Yunyao asked and helped Miao Jingjing get back to her feet.

“I’m much better now,” said Miao Jingjing. Although her life was out of danger, she still needed some time to heal because she was badly injured. She could stand and walk, but would have to rest once in a while.

After getting up, Miao Jingjing thanked Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao. “Thank you so much!” Without them, she would have been killed.

Thanking them was barely enough to return their favor, but Miao Jingjing honestly didn’t know what else she could say right now.

“Alright, let’s deal with this evil cultivator first,” said Jing Yunyao. She already saw Miao Jingjing as a close friend, so she didn’t care whether Miao Jingjing thanked her or not.

Once they mentioned the evil cultivator, Miao Jingjing suddenly looked very mad. She turned to glare at the evil cultivator. The evil cultivator immediately fought back and glared at Miao Jingjing too.

“Bai Qian, how could you be so ungrateful? I really regret saving you back then. And I’ve let you go several times afterwards,” said Miao Jingjing, clenching her teeth.

Bai Qian became an evil cultivator before Miao Jingjing. Before Bai Qian became an evil cultivator, she had suffered an assassination attempt. Miao Jingjing had rescued her and was seriously injured because of that. She didn’t recover even after resting for a few months.

After Bai Qian became an evil cultivator, Miao Jingjing met her again. She was supposed to kill Bai Qian, but she didn’t. Even if Bai Qian found her again and again in order to kill her, Miao Jingjing still let her go.

She and Bai Qian used to be very close.

“So what? Miao Jingjing, I met Dongyang before you. If it hadn’t been for you, Dongyang would have become my man. You stole him away from me. I hate you!” Bai Qian angrily said.

Hearing that, Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao figured out the grudge between them. They had to admit that it was very dramatic. They became bitter enemies because of a man! It was a typical drama, and often happened.

In this world, every man and woman has a desire for love. Some people were lucky in love, while some weren’t. Some were emotional, while some were reasonable.

Emotional people might hurt themselves or people they loved or those who their love loved if they couldn’t get the love they wanted.

Bai Qian was obviously such an emotional and cruel person.

Because she couldn’t get the man she loved, she became an evil cultivator and tried to kill the woman the man loved.

Miao Jingjing found it ridiculously funny. “You can’t force a man to love you. And it has nothing to do with who appeared first and who showed up later. There was no chemistry between you and Dongyang. You were just friends. You can’t say that I stole him from you. If he loved you, he would have been together with you. I wouldn’t have the chance to become his girlfriend.”

Bai Qian met Lin Dongyang first and Miao Jingjing met Lin Dongyang a year later. However, Bai Qian and Lin Dongyang were just friends, so it wasn’t true that she stole Lin Dongyang from Bai Qian. If Lin Dongyang loved Bai Qian, he would have done something within that year.

In fact, shortly after she met Lin Dongyang, Lin Dongyang fell in love with her.

“I don’t care. If it hadn’t been for you, I would have been able to be together with Dongyang!” Bai Zhen shouted, although she lacked confidence. She knew what Miao Jingjing said was the truth, but she refused to accept it.

“If you have to say so, I don’t think we should continue to argue.” Miao Jingjing was in no mood to argue with Bai Qian. She knew Bai Qian loved Lin Dongyang deeply and hated her to death. Otherwise, Bai Qian wouldn’t have become an evil cultivator just because Miao Jingjing married Lin Dongyang ten years ago. After ten years, Bai Qian still couldn’t get over it.

Therefore, the angry Miao Jingjing calmed down a little.

Bai Qian, however, was annoyed by Miao Jingjing’s calm attitude. “Since you love Lin Dongyang so much, why didn’t you kill yourself when he died? You don’t love him at all. Poor Lin Dongyang. He chose a cold-blooded bi*ch like you.”

Bai Qian was mentally sick, so she didn’t care what she said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

As soon as Bai Qian mentioned Lin Dongyang’s death, Miao Jingjing became angry. She coldly looked at Bai Qian and said, “I didn’t kill myself after he died because I needed to take revenge.”

She wouldn’t allow anyone to doubt her love for Lin Dongyang, because she disliked that feeling.

“Take revenge? Funny. Keep on lying! You don’t love Lin Dongyang. You just want to enjoy…” Bai Qian understood that Miao Jingjing told the truth, but she still deliberately questioned her.

Miao Jingjing was furious, but she soon calmed down. She realized that it was meaningless to continue to argue with Bai Qian, so she said, “You’re so unreasonable. I don’t think we should talk any longer. It’s meaningless.”

Afterwards, she ignored Bai Qian and turned to Jing Yunyao. “Yunyao, please help me with this.”

She needed Jing Yunyao to help her get rid of Bai Qian.

Whether or not Bai Qian had almost killed Miao Jingjing, she shouldn’t live past today because she was an evil cultivator.

“No!” Bai Qian understood that she couldn’t survive once she was caught, but she couldn’t accept it when she realized that she was about to disappear from this world.
