Chapter 1674: Arrogant Peng Zijie

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Sure,” said Gu Ning.

After that, Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao went to the private room booked by Peng Zijie.

About five minutes later, Peng Zijie came, arriving five minutes before the appointed time.

A man and a woman, who were his secretaries, followed him.

Peng Zijie was a tall man in his early forties, with a plain face, and he was wearing a formal suit today.

Gu Ning stood up and calmly greeted him. “Nice to meet you, Vice President Peng.”

Jing Yunyao also stood up but said nothing. She should be quiet when there was nothing she could do.

Peng Zijie squinted at Gu Ning. “Nice to meet you, Chairman Gu.”

“Have a seat.” He walked to the sofa and nodded at Gu Ning. He was very arrogant.

Once they were seated, Peng Zijie’s secretary ordered a waiter to serve them tea. Peng Zijie didn’t open his mouth until the waiter was out.

“Since Chairman Gu is aware of today’s meeting’s purpose, I think I should be straightforward. Lanio wants Kouzi, so I’ve been assigned to acquire it. You can still be the manager with 10% shares of Kouzi after the acquisition, and Kouzi will become a third tier brand with the help of Lanio.”

It sounded attractive, but it was simply a trap. Lanio was a famous international cosmetics corporation, so it would be very easy for Kouzi to gain greater fame if it was acquired.

Kouzi was popular now, but it still wasn’t comparable to Lanio. Lanio developed activities in over a hundred countries worldwide, and had hundreds of branches globally, whereas Kouzi was only a newly-established brand without a long history.

There was a huge gape between them.

If Gu Ning agreed to sell Kouzi to Lanio, she would lose absolute control of it. However, the products of Kouzi could be effective due to her magical power. If it was acquired by Lanio, Gu Ning wouldn’t be able to put her magical power into it anymore.

It wasn’t what Gu Ning wanted.

Although Kouzi wasn’t as successful as Lanio for the time being, she believed that it could grow to be another famous international brand in the future.

Gu Ning didn’t lack money at all, so she wasn’t attracted to the conditions laid down by Lanio.

Gu Ning smiled, “Well, to be honest with you, I can’t remember how many peers in the same industry as me have the idea to acquire Kouzi till now, but I have no intention to sell Kouzi. I only accept business cooperation, and I believe the general manager of Kouzi has already told you that.”

“What? Why?” Peng Zijie was surprised. He thought that Gu Ning agreed to meet him because she was willing to sell Kouzi.

“I don’t want to sell Kouzi,” said Gu Ning with determination.

“Do you think it’s funny to fool me?” Peng Zijie coldly stared at Gu Ning.

“Why do you say that?” Gu Ning sneered with disdain. “You’ve visited my company a few times, and the general manager of my brand has told you that we don’t want to sell Kouzi. It’s you who tried to threaten and bribe us. Don’t you think that it’s inappropriate?”

Peng Zijie was struck dumb for a second.

“Chairman Gu, it’s your honor that Lanio chose your brand,” said Peng Zijie arrogantly as usual.

“I don’t think so,” said Gu Ning in a cold tone.

“Chairman Gu, you’re still too young to be a mature businesswoman,” said Peng Zijie. “You don’t know how fierce business competition can be.”

“I know, but don’t think too highly of yourself,” said Gu Ning.

“Chairman Gu, I know that you have some connections, but people come and go for benefits and benefits only,” said Peng Zijie.
