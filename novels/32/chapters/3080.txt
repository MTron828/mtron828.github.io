3081 A Great Beauty

“Economics,” said Leng Xiaoyao. That was the major she planned to choose in university, but she had no intention of telling them that she actually wasn’t a college student yet.

Anyway, Leng Xiaoyao had told Ling Tianqi and Feng Rui not to expose the fact that she was a high school student before they came here.

Leng Xiaoyao and Feng Rui agreed that it wasn’t appropriate to tell other people that Leng Xiaoyao was a high school student. Therefore, they decided to keep it a secret.

Shen Xiyin thought Leng Xiaoyao might major in jade or jewelry, but that wasn’t right.

After further thinking, she understood that not only professionals could recognize types of jade. Some people who saw a lot of jade could know about the types too. Accordingly, Shen Xiyin didn’t ask more about it.

Leng Xiaoyao chatted with Shen Xiyin about something unimportant. It was not really helpful for her investigation, but she still collected useful information.

During the brief chat, Leng Xiaoyao observed Shen Xiyin’s words and behavior. Shen Xiyin didn’t seem to be a bad person, and left a good impression on Leng Xiaoyao, but some people were good at disguising themselves, so it couldn’t prove that Shen Xiyin was innocent.

Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t ask some questions straightforwardly, but Jiang Yiyi did her a favor.

“Miss Shen, Have you visited the An family yet?” asked Jiang Yiyi.

“Yeah, I have.” Shen Xiyin answered and looked slightly shy.

“Were you nervous at your first meeting?” asked Jiang Yiyi.

“Of course, but Mr. An and Mrs. An were very kind, so I was a lot more relaxed afterwards,” Shen Xiyin admitted.

“Can you tell me what you prepared when you visited the An family, Miss Shen?” asked Leng Xiaoyao. It was a very normal question, so it wouldn’t arouse suspicion.

In fact, they believed there was something special between Leng Xiaoyao and Ling Tianqi, so they thought that Leng Xiaoyao needed some advice.

“I prepared a calligraphy and painting from a famous artist for Mr. An, a jade necklace designed and made by me for Mrs. An. Because I didn’t have enough time. I sent Chenjun’s younger sister a jade pendant that I had kept for a long time. It isn’t new, but it is very valuable,” Shen Xiyin said.

Leng Xiaoyao was observing Shen Xiyin’s expression all the time. When Shen Xiyin talked about her gift to An Chenmeng, she seemed very calm. There was nothing wrong with her, so Leng Xiaoyao guessed Shen Xiyin might not know the problem of the jade pendant, but Leng Xiaoyao didn’t ask for more details.

After staying in the clubhouse for an hour, Leng Xiaoyao said that she had to go. Ling Tianqi made up an excuse that he needed to talk about something with Leng Xiaoyao, then followed her out.

“How is it? Did you find anything?” Ling Tianqi asked with concern when they were out of the clubhouse.

“Not yet. Perhaps she’s innocent. She simply has something to do with what I’m investigating, so I felt it was necessary to spend some time with her. Please don’t be biased against her just because of me,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

After spending an hour with her, Leng Xiaoyao saw nothing wrong with Shen Xiyin. Shen Xiyin was either innocent or was too good at pretending.

If Shen Xiyin was good at pretending, it would be difficult for Leng Xiaoyao to find anything wrong with her even after meeting her a few times. It would take a lot longer.

“I see.” Ling Tianqi answered. He didn’t ask more about that, and only told Leng Xiaoyao to turn to him for help if she needed it.

“Let me give you a ride,” Ling Tianqi offered.

“Thanks, but I don’t think you should be gone for too long since your friends are here. It’s late now. And you would probably separate by the time you give me a ride and come back. I’ll just take a car that is arranged by the clubhouse,” Leng Xiaoyao said. The clubhouse provided the service of picking up the guests and sending them home. Therefore, it was very convenient to get a car.

“Great!” Since Leng Xiaoyao said that, Ling Tianqi didn’t insist. After all, she wasn’t weak and she could protect herself even if there was danger.

After that, Ling Tianqi went to ask the clubhouse to arrange for a car to send Leng Xiaoyao home.

When Leng Xiaoyao got back to the Leng family’s mansion, she saw a new face in the living room.

Actually, the person wasn’t a stranger, he was also a member of the Leng family, he just rarely came home.

The man was Leng Yehua’s son who was studying outside, Leng Yuchen.

Leng Yuchen didn’t come home until this afternoon. Once he was home, he heard a lot of news about Leng Xiaoyao.

Song Meiyu shared the news about Leng Xiaoyao ending the engagement with Chu Jianan the next day after it happened with Leng Yuchen, but he didn’t know that Leng Xiaoyao suddenly became excellent at studying till he was back. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

In addition, Leng Xiaoyao was good at martial arts and rescued people from a fire. One of the people she had rescued was even Lu Changwei. Leng Yuchen heard the news after he was home.

When he heard the news, he was amazed. He couldn’t believe that Leng Xiaoyao suddenly became so amazing.

Therefore, he thought Leng Xiaoyao might be possessed by a ghost. Anyway, he refused to believe that Leng Xiaoyao was outstanding now.

It was hard for them to accept the fact that Leng Xiaoyao was completely different now, but it was even harder for them to admit that Leng Xiaoyao became extremely pretty after she came back wearing make-up.

At first glance, Leng Changyuan didn’t recognize Leng Xiaoyao. He even thought that she was a visitor from another family.

So after Leng Xiaoyao greeted him, he was surprised and immediately stood up from the sofa. “Y-Yaoyao? Is this…”

Leng Changyuan couldn’t believe his eyes, because Leng Xiaoyao was stunning!

Leng Yecheng didn’t come back to his senses for a long while. Then he complimented Leng Xiaoyao. “I was wondering who this beautiful girl is! It turns out to be Yaoyao. I knew Yaoyao is a great beauty, but the freckles on her face affected it.”

In fact, they were aware that Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t ugly, and that the freckles affected her beauty, but when they saw that the freckles were covered, they were surprised to see that Leng Xiaoyao was even prettier than they had expected!

Therefore, Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng felt happy for Leng Xiaoyao, but Leng Yehua, Song Meiyu, and Leng Yuchen had a different feeling.

Leng Yuqi was absent, otherwise she would be as upset as them.

Staring at Leng Xiaoyao, Song Meiyu was jealous. It seemed as if she couldn’t wait to tear Leng Xiaoyao’s face to pieces.

How could Leng Xiaoyao be so beautiful? It was impossible! What if Chu Jianan saw her?

After all, Leng Xiaoyao was better than Leng Yuqi in every aspect now!

What she didn’t know was that Chu Jianan had already met Leng Xiaoyao. Although he said he didn’t regret leaving Leng Xiaoyao for Leng Yuqi, he was actually full of regrets. At this time, he was drinking alone in his apartment. Even though Leng Yuqi sent him messages, he didn’t bother to reply to her.
