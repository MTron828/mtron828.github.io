Chapter 2238: Zhou Xing’s Choice

Zhou Xing was an orphan. He didn’t have a family and only had comrades in the team, so he listened to Leng Shaoting and went to work in Shengshi.

Soldiers trained by the Red Flame were physically strong and had other skills, so Leng Shaoting would arrange a suitable job for Zhou Xing.

It wouldn’t be tiring, but wouldn’t be easy either. Zhou Xing needed to be qualified to do the job Leng Shaoting offered him.

As for the salary, it wasn’t low in Shengshi.

…

After a while, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting arrived at Zhou Xing’s ward in the Military General Hospital.

At this time, there were about five people in Zhou Xing’s ward. In addition to Chen Xun, Chen Meng, and other comrades who were taking care of Zhou Xing, there were a few new faces.

They came to pick Zhou Xing up after Zhou Xing left the hospital. In fact, many of their comrades wanted to come, but there were too many of them and they needed to train, so only a few of them came.

“Hi, boss, Miss Gu.”

As soon as Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting showed up, Chen Meng greeted them first.

“Hi, boss, Miss Gu.” Chen Xun and the others also greeted them. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Although Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting weren’t married yet, they already took them as a couple.

All of them were aware of Leng Shaoting’s attitude towards women, and that Gu Ning was the only girl who was so close to him. It meant he took her seriously.

Gu Ning was only his girlfriend now, but they would get married in a year or two.

The others hadn’t seen Gu Ning before, but they had all heard about her. After Chen Xun greeted them, they also greeted, “Hi, boss, Miss Gu!”

They knew it was Gu Ning who had saved Zhou Xing’s life, so they all admired her. They were also aware that Gu Ning was only nineteen and was very pretty, but they were still amazed when they saw her in reality.

“Miss Gu, thank you so much for saving me. If it hadn’t been for you, I would have lost my life.” Zhou Xing saluted to Gu Ning at once and thanked her respectfully.

Although he was a soldier and carried out tasks very often, it was still a very dangerous job. He was mentally-prepared to lose his life, but it didn’t mean he wasn’t afraid of death. Therefore, he felt very lucky when he was rescued.

However, in retrospect, he was still scared.

“My pleasure,” Gu Ning said.

Zhou Xing had already packed his stuff up. They only waited here because Leng Shaoting was coming.

So now that Leng Shaoting was there, they should leave.

When they walked out, they saw the deputy dean in the hall.

Because of what had happened between them, the deputy dean was a little embarrassed to see Gu Ning. He didn’t say anything and directly walked in another direction.

Gu Ning didn’t care about that.

The deputy dean avoided meeting Gu Ning’s eyes not only because he was embarrassed, but also because he learned that Zhou Xing was Leng Shaoting’s comrade afterwards. It scared him!

He hadn’t met Leng Shaoting before, but he knew Leng Shaoting was a very important figure. He originally thought Zhou Xing was a poor soldier, but unexpectedly Zhou Xing had a close relationship with Leng Shaoting.

If he had known that before, he wouldn’t have been so arrogant.

Although it wasn’t wrong to have stopped Gu Ning from healing Zhou Xing, his attitude was unacceptable.

…

Zhou Xing had a single apartment in the capital, so he went directly there.

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning didn’t go with him, neither did Chen Meng. Chen Xun and the others sent him home.

Zhou Xing would go to work after he had made a full recovery. He had retirement fees and compensation of a million yuan, so there would be no problem even if he didn’t go to work during this time.

A million yuan was a lot for ordinary people.

After they left, Gu Ning called Jing Yunyao and asked her where she was now. She would go to pick her up and they could go to visit the Leng family together.

Even if it was hours away from dinner, they could spend more time with Master Leng if they went there earlier.

Before they went to visit the Leng family, Leng Shaoting called Master Leng and asked him whether he was home.

Although Master Leng stayed at home most of the time, he often gathered together with Master Xu, Jiang Zhongyu and his other old friends.

He was old and didn’t work any longer, so he felt bored once he had nothing to do. It was a good thing that he still had old friends to meet.

Now Master Leng was at home, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to the Leng family’s house after picking up Jing Yunyao at the Flowers and Plants Trading Center.

Leng Yuanzhen, Leng Yuanqian, and their wives were at work. Leng Shaoxi was busy with her internship, so she rarely came home either, and Leng Shaoxun needed to go to classes, so he was also absent. Only Leng Shaojia stayed at home with Master Leng.

Normally, Leng Shaojia stayed in her room and seldom came out, even if there was only Master Leng in the house.

Leng Shaojia was much gloomier now. She was quiet and refused to talk to other people.

In the beginning, Master Leng would try to persuade her to spend more time outside. She said yes every time, but never changed.

Knowing it was useless, Master Leng gradually stopped trying to change her.

After what Leng Shaojia had done to Gu Ning, he was completely disappointed in her. However, she was his granddaughter after all, so he still hoped that she could live a good life.

Gu Ning didn’t pay Leng Shaojia back, but Master Leng couldn’t get over it. He still felt guilty for what Gu Ning had been through, but he wouldn’t show it on his face.

Leng Shaojia gazed out of the window all the time, so she saw Leng Shaoting’s car once it came inside. She was upset, then turned around to sleep. She was reluctant to see Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning. She hated them, and felt guilty too.

Although Leng Shaojia had paid someone else to attack Gu Ning, she had lost her reason back then, and didn’t dare to do that again. In fact, every time she thought about that now, she felt horrified and regretted doing it. She had failed to harm Gu Ning and was punished severely.

She now clearly knew she would be punished even more seriously if she had really caused Gu Ning to die.

Leng Shaoting wouldn’t let her go and would surely put her in jail. She absolutely couldn’t stand life in prison! Moreover, she would be tortured by nightmares. She wasn’t mentally strong after all, and wouldn’t be able to live a peaceful life after killing someone.

After Leng Shaoting and the others came, Master Leng smiled the entire time. It was obvious that he was really happy.
