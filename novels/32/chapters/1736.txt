Chapter 1737: Upset but Not Annoyed

At 5 pm, Jing Yunyao and Yu Yin went back to the Leng family’s old house. Because Jing Yunyao came back with a lot of shopping bags, she felt embarrassed when she saw Master Leng again. She was worried that she might leave a bad impression on Master Leng.

“Although they’re not many, you can go shopping again when you’re free next time.” Leng Shaoting glanced at those shopping bags. He wasn’t very satisfied with Jing Yunyao’s shopping ability.

Jing Yunyao, however, was surprised. “They’re a lot.”

“I don’t think it’s enough even if you take everything in the store home,” said Leng Shaoting.

Jing Yunyao felt touched. After that, she took out the clothes she bought for Leng Shaoting and Master Leng.

Jing Yunyao didn’t tell them that she paid the bill with her own card, because she had spent a lot of Leng Shaoting’s money after all. What Leng Shaoting had given her was much more than what she could give him.

Leng Shaoting and Master Leng were happy to receive gifts from her, and they didn’t care who paid the bill.

They cared about each other after all, so they were happy to receive gifts from someone they cared about.

...

At this time, Gu Ning and her friends went back to the city center. They were exhausted after touring for a whole day, but Gu Ning stayed energetic because she had magical power to nourish herself.

Gu Ning didn’t share her magical power with her friends not because she was mean, but because it wasn’t necessary. They weren’t injured, nor sick after all. They had to learn to improve their own physical condition by accepting pressure.

Afterwards, they decided to have a big seafood meal together.

When they were stuffed, they were full of energy again. After having the meal, they went back to have a rest. There was nothing fun to do in the night after all.

They could only go to bars in the night, but they were still very young, and shouldn’t go to bars very often.

Gu Ning drove Hao Ran and the boys to the hotel, then went back to Century City.

Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping would fly back to City F at 2 pm tomorrow, so Gu Ning would send them to the airport after lunch then.

Mu Ke stayed in the hotel for the time being, and he would go to the university when the new semester began.

Chu Peihan and Yu Mixi continued to live in Century City.

Because most college students needed to live in dormitories, they would live in their schools after the new semester began. Gu Ning would gather with them on weekends if they were free.

They could also come and stay in her place on weekends if they wanted, including Mu Ke.

Baili Zongyang and his younger sister lived here, so Leng Shaoting couldn’t come. Therefore, if Leng Shaoting came back, Gu Ning would go to meet him at Mountain River Garden. In that case, Chu Peihan could stay in her house, and it wouldn’t cause her any trouble.

If Gu Ning was busy, she would leave to deal with her business and there was no need for her to give her friends special treatment. They were very close now anyway.

When they were back in Century City, it was only 9 pm, so Gu Ning called Jing Yunyao to talk with her for a while.

At this time, Jing Yunyao and Leng Shaoting were on their way back to Mountain River Garden, but they weren’t going home. Instead, they went to meet Jing Jining in the hotel across Mountain River Garden.

It was time for Leng Shaoting to see Jing Jining. Although Jing Jining always knew about the existence of Leng Shaoting and he had secretly helped Leng Shaoting a lot, Leng Shaoting didn’t know him at all.

Seeing that Gu Ning called Jing Yunyao of her own accord and didn’t give him a call, Leng Shaoting felt upset. However, he wasn’t annoyed, because Jing Yunyao was his mother and it was a good thing if his future wife could have a close relationship with his mother.

Jing Yunyao got along quite well with Gu Ning, and didn’t take her as a girl who was much younger than her. They were like friends, and Jing Yunyao told Gu Ning what she had done today.

When Leng Shaoting heard that a woman had deliberately made things difficult for Jing Yunyao in a clothing store, he was displeased.

Although he knew ordinary people couldn’t hurt Jing Yunyao, he was still affected because he cared about her.

“No matter what you’ll encounter, you can fight back as long as you’ve done nothing wrong. You can also teach her a lesson, but don’t disable or kill her. No one can bully members of the Leng family,” said Gu Ning.

She also knew that Jing Yunyao wasn’t weak at all, but she was worried that Jing Yunyao might feel aggrieved.

There were many rules in the mortals’ world, but it would be acceptable as long as it was allowed by the law.

Besides, if they had to use violence, it must be the last resort. When they were left no choice, it wasn’t a big deal if they injured someone.

“I know.” Jing Yunyao felt warm in heart when she felt that she was being cared about.

When Gu Ning heard Jing Yunyao mention the Tang family, her face changed a little. Once Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping left tomorrow, she would get down to her serious business.

“I think the woman won’t dare to do anything after learning about Aunt Yin’s family background,” said Gu Ning.

Bullies only dared to bully those who were weaker than them, so Gu Ning believed that the woman would stay away from Jing Yunyao after knowing Yu Yin’s family background.

Gu Ning was right. As soon as Mrs. Tong learned of Yu Yin’s influence, she didn’t dare to have the idea of taking revenge. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Right, she shouldn’t be so stupid,” said Jing Yunyao. Even if Mrs. Tong wouldn’t give up, there was nothing to be afraid of.

Jing Yunyao wasn’t worried about that, she simply disliked unnecessary trouble.

They talked for a while longer, then hung up the phone.

Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao soon arrived at the hotel where Jing Jining stayed. Because Jing Yunyao gave him a call before she came here, Jing Jining was waiting for them.

Jing Yunyao hadn’t yet told Leng Shaoting that Jing Jining was actually paying special attention to him and had even secretly helped him a lot. She wanted to tell him earlier, but Gu Ning called her.

It was too late to talk about that right now so she decided to do that after they met each other.
