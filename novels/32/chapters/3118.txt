3120 A Secret I Can Never Tell

After the call with Shen Xiyin, Leng Xiaoyao called Li Mochen again, telling him the number of the flight she chose.

“Great, I’ll book the plane tickets later,” Li Mochen said.

“Um, can I ask you about something, Brother Mochen?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Of course,” Li Mochen replied.

“Do you have a relationship with the Mo family in City Chang?” Leng Xiaoyao asked. It was a simple question, but Leng Xiaoyao hesitated a long time to say it. She didn’t want to arouse suspicion. After all, Li Mochen didn’t fully trust her yet.

“Yes.” Li Mochen answered at once. He understood why Leng Xiaoyao asked about that. It must have something to do with the party she had dreamed about.

The party was held by the Mo family, but Li Mochen didn’t have any suspicions just because Leng Xiaoyao asked him that question.

“Will you attend it too?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Yes,” Li Mochen said.

In the previous incarnation, Leng Xiaoyao focused on Chu Jianan, so she didn’t remember whether Li Mochen attended the party or if he showed up at the hotel by coincidence. She didn’t ask about it either afterwards.

“I’ll go as well. The Mo family sent me an invitation letter. We can meet at that time.” Leng Xiaoyao was excited, but she was actually happy because she could stop Li Mochen from getting into trouble with her presence.

However, Li Mochen felt she was pleased to see him, and his heart skipped a beat.

“Great, see you then,” Li Mochen said.

Li Mochen wasn’t in City Chang right now. He went to deal with business somewhere else. He wouldn’t go to City Chang until the morning of the day after tomorrow.

After having the call with Li Mochen, Leng Xiaoyao was distracted for a long while. When she came back to her senses, she started working.

Li Mochen called Si Yiqi next and told him that Leng Xiaoyao wanted to go to City Yun on Friday to deal with something. And they booked a flight at 9 am.

He asked Si Yiqi if Si Yiqi could go with them.

When Li Mochen said that, he didn’t think much, but Si Yiqi was shocked.

“Li Mochen, I can’t believe my ears. Why do you prefer to go with Leng Xiaoyao rather than me? Tell me, is there anything going on between Leng Xiaoyao and you?” Si Yiqi asked. Li Mochen was too strange to not arouse his suspicions.

Li Mochen suddenly realized that what he had just said indeed easily caused misunderstandings, so he wasn’t annoyed when Si Yiqi questioned him.

“You’re going too far,” Li Mochen said, but didn’t explain it, because he didn’t know how to explain it.

“Your behavior can’t stop me from thinking too much!” Si Yiqi said. He didn’t believe there was nothing happening between Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen.

Li Mochen had mixed emotions and didn’t know what to say. “Alright, what’s your decision? If you don’t want to go with us, I’ll book my own plane tickets first.”

“Sure, I’ll go with you. And I’ll book the plane tickets.” Si Yiqi wanted to go with them to see what was happening between Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen.

“How about Leng Xiaoyao? Should I book plane tickets for her as well?” Si Yiqi asked.

“She’ll do that by herself,” Li Mochen said.

“Fine!” Si Yiqi agreed.

…

Leng Xiaoyao read messages in the WeChat group of Xiaoyao Technology. It was made on the same day that she bought the company. They turned to her for help every day if they had questions. Leng Xiaoyao would reply to them the moment she read their questions.

The business was handled well by Mu Yufan and the others.

Because the company almost went bankrupt, most clients wanted to end their cooperation. They didn’t dare to work with small companies anymore, in case there were any problems.

The clients wanted to end their cooperation, so Xiaoyao Technology didn’t need to pay liquidated damages.

Some clients were willing to give Xiaoyao Technology another chance, mainly because they had already spent a lot of money. Even if they wanted to end the agreement, they had to wait till the contract expired.

The validity was usually a year, which wasn’t long.

In addition, Xiaoyao Technology had outstanding skills.

Jiang Zeshu heard that Fengyang became Xiaoyao Technology now, but he didn’t contact Mu Yufan and the others after he betrayed them.

He had decided not to see them again. Mu Yufan and the others had the same idea, but Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai had a business meal today, and they ran into Jiang Zeshu on their way out.

Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai hated Jiang Zeshu, but they didn’t sue him for the sake of their friendship in the past.

Nevertheless, their friendship was over when Jiang Zeshu chose to betray them. Even though they met again, they were merely strangers.

As a result, Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai said nothing when they saw Jiang Zeshu.

They only gave Jiang Zeshu a glance, then moved their gaze away, because they might lose control and beat him if they looked at him a second longer.

Jiang Zeshu didn’t dare to meet their eyes, and was aware that their friendship was over. He also agreed to be strangers and had no intention of greeting them.

However, someone didn’t want to pretend to be strangers, so he talked to Mu Yufan.

“Hi, Executive Mu, I heard you sold your company. Why are you still working in it now? How does it feel to become an employee after being the boss?”

It was a man who was about thirty years old. He was a deputy manager, He Fangqi, of the company that Jiang Zeshu was working for now. He was also the cousin of Jiang Zeshu’s girlfriend.

Because they were peers, they had competed with each other many times before. Therefore, as soon as he saw Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai, he made fun of them.

After all, it was pleasant to see your enemies have misfortune. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

However, Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai didn’t seem sad at all. Instead, they were full of hope for their future. And they believed they had a brighter future ahead because they had met an extremely excellent boss.

All in all, they felt lucky.
