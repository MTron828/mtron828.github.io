Chapter 442 Rescue A Woman

“The capital,” Gu Ning said. “How about you?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The gate where Qiu Yuxin stood wasn’t to the capital, so Gu Ning asked.

“Oh, I’m flying to Malaysia for work,” Qiu Yuxin said.

After they chatted for a while longer, the radio announced that the plane to Malaysia was about to take off. Qiu Yuxin then said to them, “Sorry, I have to leave now. See you around!”

They said good-bye to each other and Qiu Yuxin went to get aboard. Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin also went to their gate.

“Ningning, how come all the people you know are from either rich or powerful families? Tell me. How did you meet Qiu Yuxin?” Cao Wenxin asked with curiosity.

“She’s the best friend of the younger cousin of my boyfriend’s close friend. We’ve met several times,” Gu Ning said, but she didn’t mention that her boyfriend’s close friend was Xu Jinchen.

Cao Wenxin understood, and didn’t ask further.

They sat down in chairs in front of the gate, waiting to get aboard. Before long, the radio announced that passengers to the capital needed to be ready to go aboard. However, right at that moment, someone exclaimed, “Jesus! A woman fainted!”

Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin immediately turned back. The woman who passed out was waiting at the same gate as them, and she wasn’t far behind them. The young woman fell to the ground in unconsciousness, and there was a little boy around four-years-old standing crying beside her. People surrounded them at once, but none of them went to help the young woman get back to her feet.

Nobody knew whether they should move her or not, because it seemed dangerous, so people were all waiting for the workers at the airport to come.

Gu Ning, on the other hand, ran straight to the young woman, followed by Cao Wenxin.

“Please move! Give her some fresh air!” Gu Ning raised her voice and said to the onlookers.

People began to move back. However, when Gu Ning squatted at the young woman’s side, someone said, “Miss, don’t move her body. It can be dangerous!”

It was understandable that nobody dared to help the young woman, because they weren’t doctors.

Gu Ning didn’t care. She took out a small porcelain bottle from her backpack and poured the power crystal out. When Gu Ning was about to put the pill into the young woman’s mouth, a male and two female workers from the airport arrived and stopped her. The leading female worker snapped at Gu Ning, “Stop it! What are you doing? What if she dies? Can you bear the result?” Saying that, she came to push Gu Ning away. Gu Ning avoided her but failed to put the pill into the young woman’s mouth.

“If she dies, I’ll bear the result,” Cao Wenxin said, because she totally trusted Gu Ning.

Another female worker looked at Cao Wenxin. Seeing that Cao Wenxin was very pretty, she felt jealous and suddenly became rude. “You? Who do you think you are? What a joke!”

“Then can you bear the result if she dies at this airport?” Gu Ning coldly stared at them when they stood in her way.

“Why should we take the responsibility? We didn’t cause her to pass out!” A female worker retorted impolitely.

“Because you stopped me from rescuing her!” Gu Ning said.

“Rescuing her? Judging by your age, I bet you are just a student. Do you think that you are a doctor or something?” the female worker said with obvious disdain.

Passengers flying to the capital started to board, but the leading female worker still stood there and did nothing for no reason. Gu Ning lost her patience, and pushed her away. “Block their way. If they dare to move, punch them,” Gu Ning said to Cao Wenxin before she squatted again.

The leading female worker was pushed backwards a few steps, and almost fell. She was surprised and then furious. However, before she could react, Gu Ning had already put the pill into the unconscious woman’s mouth. Nonetheless, Gu Ning didn’t know why the young woman had passed out, so she used her Jade Eyes to see the condition of the young woman’s body. While Gu Ning was examining the young woman, she secretly put her power inside as well.

The leading female worker was in a rage, because Gu Ning had not only pushed her, but had threatened her as well.

“How dare you push me! Do you know who I am?” Saying that, she ran to Gu Ning, because she didn’t think that Cao Wenxin and Gu Ning would really dare to punch her.

Actually, Gu Ning already had pushed her, and Cao Wenxin would, of course, dare to punch her. Therefore, when the leading female worker ran at Gu Ning, Cao Wenxin directly went ahead and did a seoi nage[1]. “I don’t care who the hell you are, because I’ll punch you, whoever you are!”

Cao Wenxin wasn’t a gentle girl, so she didn’t reduce her strength at all. With a loud, agonized scream, the woman was thrown over Cao Wenxin’s shoulder and hit the ground heavily.

Seeing that, everyone was shocked, not only because Cao Wenxin really attacked the leading female worker, but also because she was so awesome.

Hearing the scream, the other two workers were frightened.

“You...” They moved backwards in fear, and didn’t dare to go help the leading female worker on the ground.

Meanwhile, the young woman gradually got her consciousness back.

Everyone’s attention was drawn to her at once. And everyone looked at Gu Ning with surprise. Some thought that she must have been lucky, because it wasn’t uncommon that people woke up after fainting for a short time. However, no matter what, it was good news that the young woman went back to normal.

This young woman was physically weak, so she easily fainted when she lacked energy or strength. Although it wasn’t deadly that she passed out all of a sudden because she would wake up after having a rest, it was still dangerous if anything bad happened during her unconsciousness. Besides, what if her child was kidnapped when she passed out? All in all, nothing was more precious than a healthy body.

Within seconds, the young woman was completely clear-headed. She abruptly sat up from the ground, and held the little boy without delay. “Oh, my baby. Don’t cry. Don’t cry. Mommy is fine.”

Seeing that his mommy was awake, the little boy gradually stopped crying.
