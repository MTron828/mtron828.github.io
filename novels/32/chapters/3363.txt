3366 Move out

Leng Yecheng made the decision to talk to Leng Changyuan about it because Leng Xiaoyao supported him. If he kept on paying the bills for them, he might end up in endless trouble.

As the saying goes, “One bowl of rice feeds a benefactor, but one bucket of rice feeds an enemy.” If you help someone occasionally, they would be grateful to you, but if you helped them too much, they would take it for granted.

The next day was Saturday, so neither Leng Yehua nor Song Meiyu went to work.

After having breakfast, Leng Yecheng opened his mouth. “Brother Yehua, although we live under the same roof, we are now two separate families. So, there are some things that I think need to be clarified.”

Upon hearing that, both Leng Yehua and Song Meiyu had a bad premonition.

“What do you mean by saying this, Yecheng?” Song Meiyu asked anxiously.

Leng Yecheng gave Song Meiyu a glance with disdain, then said, “What do I mean? As a younger brother, I have no obligation to support you. I have supported you for so many years, but instead of gaining a benefactor, I have gained an enemy. I don’t want to cause myself trouble any longer!”

“Are you trying to kick us out?” Song Meiyu grew impatient and her voice became high-pitched.

“Can you let me finish?” Leng Yecheng raised his voice impatiently and said coldly, “Even if I really want to kick you out, what right do you have to stay?”

“I…” Song Meiyu wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Leng Yehua. “Shut up, let Yecheng finish.”

Leng Yehua’s heart sank after hearing what Leng Yecheng said. However, he knew that all of this was caused by themselves. If Leng Yecheng kicked them out of the house, they would have nothing to say.

He didn’t want to leave. Everything was comfortable here. If they left, they would have to live in a small house and rent a place to live.

They had never bought their own house. Besides, they spent their money recklessly over the years and had no savings.

“Yecheng, please continue,” said Leng Yehua.

Leng Yecheng still had hopes for his elder brother, so he didn’t want to cut off all ties with them. Otherwise, they would be just like strangers and it would be impossible for them to get anything from him.

“Although I paid for this house, it is still under our father’s name. So I won’t kick you out. This is still your home. You can live here if you want, but only your generation and without the right to inherit it. When Yuchen gets married, he’ll need to leave this home too. He can stay here for a short while, but if you’re gone, he’ll also need to move out. The same goes for Yuqi…” said Leng Yecheng.

Before Leng Yecheng finished speaking, Song Meiyu couldn’t help interrupt. ‘What? No right to inherit?”

She thought that this house would belong to their family in the future, but Leng Yecheng told them that they had no right to inherit it.

“What? Do you want to inherit my house?” Leng Yecheng asked with a sneer.

Song Meiyu was too greedy. She lived in a house that someone else bought and already got a big advantage, yet she still wanted the right to inherit it?

For a moment, Leng Yecheng wanted to pick up the ashtray and throw it at her.

“Isn’t the house under father’s name? Your eldest brother is also your father’s son!” Song Meiyu said.

“The money came from me! What? Are you not satisfied that you can live here till you pass away?” Leng Yecheng mocked.

“…” Song Meiyu wanted to say something, but was warned by Leng Yehua’s gaze and kept quiet.

Leng Yecheng continued. “Brother Yehua, I’ll transfer the car that you drive to you. It’ll be yours from now on. Starting next month, you need to pay four thousand yuan for living expenses per month. If you don’t want to live here, I won’t stop you.”

Both Leng Yehua and Song Meiyu earned over ten thousand yuan per month. They weren’t ordinary employees and had official positions. It wasn’t too much for them to pay four thousand yuan.

However, Song Meiyu, who was used to getting things for free, exploded when she heard that. “What? Four thousand yuan? That’s too much…”

“Too much? Then let me calculate it for you right now. The two housekeepers and a driver in the house each earn over eight thousand yuan per month. The expenses for food and drinks alone are over ten thousand yuan per month. There are also water and electricity bills, which are one or two thousand yuan per month. And property management fees each year, which are not low. Four thousand yuan is just enough for your family’s food and drink expenses. You don’t need to pay for anything else. You live in the house and drive the car for free. Tell me, where are you losing out? I’m the one losing out here and I’m not even complaining. You, on the other hand, are already getting things for free, but you are still complaining.” Leng Yecheng was getting angry and even felt like kicking them out directly. “If you don’t want to pay, go start your own household. Let’s see how you’ll live on four thousand yuan per month. If it weren’t for my elder brother, I wouldn’t even care if you starved to death. Don’t take my kindness for granted.”

Song Meiyu didn’t know what to say. Compared to all these expenses, four thousand yuan was really not much.

However, Leng Yecheng was much richer than them!

Even though four thousand yuan wasn’t much compared to these expenses, it was still a lot for them as a couple!

It was ridiculous. Did they really think that they didn’t need to pay for anything if Leng Yecheng didn’t do it for them?

“I agree with Yecheng.” Leng Yehua agreed. He didn’t dare to have any objections. He also knew that they had gotten a lot of benefits. If they continued to make trouble, he would feel ashamed.

“Honey…” Song Meiyu disagreed strongly.

“If you don’t want to live here, get out,” Leng Yehua said angrily.

“Meiyu, you can’t be so ungrateful. Over the years, how much have you benefited from Yecheng? Don’t you even have any gratitude? Back then, Yecheng was afraid that you wouldn’t be able to adapt to living here, so he put the house under my name. Have you been treating other people’s things as your own after living here so long? Aren’t you afraid of being criticized? Yecheng is also going to get married. If it were Yehua who raised Yecheng’s family like this, would you be willing to do it?” Leng Changyuan said seriously.

Song Meiyu had nothing to say. If it had been up to her, she definitely wouldn’t be willing to do that. Let alone raise them, if they stayed for even ten days or half a month, she wouldn’t be happy! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Alright, that’s settled. Anyone who has objections can leave,” Leng Changyuan said coldly. Leng Yehua’s family had really been spoiled rotten.

It was his fault for only thinking about having the family live together and not considering that some people would turn into ingrates after being spoiled for too long.

Even though his second and third sons were good people, his first son wasn’t.
