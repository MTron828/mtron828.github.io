1191 A Cunning Trick

“Didn’t you say the promise never existed? Why did you try to grab the phone away?” Members of the Warriors sneered.

There was no need for them to show the proof right now, because the reaction of the members of the Bulls already proved everything.

Unfortunately, the leader and coach of the Bulls were absent, and the rest of the members of the Bulls didn’t know how to handle it.

“Ha-ha, actually we don’t have a recording, and we have no intention to force you to fulfill your promise either, but you’ve embarrassed yourselves in front of everyone!” a member of the Warriors said.

The Warriors didn’t have the power to punish the Bulls, so it was useless even if they had a voice recording.

“How dare you trick us!” The members of the Bulls were furious.

“So what? We only did it because you refused to admit it,” the members of the Warriors said.

“You...” The members of the Bulls were struck dumb.

“Alright, let’s go now. I’m starving. Why don’t we dine together to celebrate the great success today?” a member of the Warriors said.

“Good idea!” Gu Ning cheered.

After that, they walked together to the outside.

The coach of the Warriors joined them as well. Although Gu Ning won the game with the help of her kung fu skills, he still admired her.

“Oh, Xiaoyu is supposed to pay the bill today, but he couldn’t come because he’s injured. He already told me to do it for him. Miss Gu has done us a great favor, and we should thank her,” a member of the Warriors said.

They normally ate in the canteen, because the food there was very cheap. And when they dined outside, they tended to split the bill.

Even though they weren’t poor, they were already used to it.

“Miss Gu, thank you so much for treating Xiaoyu’s leg. He’s very important in our team,” another member of the Warriors said.

“What? She treated Xiaoyu’s leg?” Their coach was very surprised hearing that.

“Yeah, Miss Gu just treated Xiaoyu’s leg yesterday, and Xiaoyu told me that he feels much better today. He can walk now, but it will still take time for him to make a full recovery,” a member of the Warriors said with excitement.

They were confident that Teng Xiaoyu would be well again in a few days.

“Really?” Their coach couldn’t believe his ears.

After all, the doctor said it would take at least half a month for Teng Xiaoyu to recover, but Gu Ning was able to cure him within several days. Gu Ning didn’t seem to be an experienced doctor in his eyes.

Although he knew that Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl after watching the game, he still couldn’t believe that she could easily cure Teng Xiaoyu.

“It is true!” The members of the Warriors confirmed it.

“Miss Gu, thank you so much!” Their coach turned to thank Gu Ning at once.

Teng Xiaoyu was indeed very important to the Warriors, so it was good news for them if he could recover soon.

The coach was curious about how Gu Ning was able to cure Teng Xiaoyu, but he didn’t ask further about it.

He knew that he shouldn’t ask for more details if Gu Ning didn’t tell them of her own accord.

“It’s not a big deal. Xiaoyu is a close friend of my older cousin, so I’m more than willing to help,” Gu Ning said with a smile.

If it hadn’t been for Tang Jiakai, Teng Xiaoyu wouldn’t have been treated by Gu Ning. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Your older cousin?” The coach was curious.

“Miss Gu’s older cousin is Tang Jiakai,” a member of the Warriors said.

Their coach was aware of Tang Jiakai’s family background, but he didn’t know much about the Tang family’s family affairs.

In addition, Gu Ning and Tang Jiakai didn’t share the same family name, so the coach didn’t know that they were relatives.

“Oh, thank you so much, Jiakai!” the coach thanked Tang Jiakai at once.

“My pleasure. Xiaoyu is a close friend of mine, so I must do something to help him if I can. By the way, the Bulls are really hateful, and we should teach them a lesson!” Tang Jiakai said.

Tang Jiakai hated people who played dirty tricks, especially when the victim was his close friend.

...

After that, they began to casually chat with each other.

Although the coach didn’t ask for details about how Gu Ning cured Teng Xiaoyu, he was curious about Gu Ning’s medical level. Therefore, he asked Gu Ning whether she was a medical student.

Gu Ning knew nothing about medicine, and she was very honest. However, she could see that the coach wanted to ask her something about illnesses.

Accordingly, Gu Ning told the coach to ask her anything he wanted to know and she was willing to give him some advice if he needed it.
