1203 A Better Choice

If Li Zhongwei didn’t need her help, she would withdraw without delay.

After a long while, Li Zhongwei asked, “Are you ready?”

“Yeah, I’m ready,” Du Jingtong said. This time, she reminded herself to be fully cautious.

“The second round begins!” Li Zhongwei shouted.

Du Jingtong and Gu Ning began to attack each other once more.

Although Du Jingtong stayed very alert this time, she was still beaten by Gu Ning within seconds.

Nobody doubted Gu Ning’s ability after the second round, and they admired Gu Ning more now.

Du Jingtong was disappointed, but had to accept the result. It was embarrassing that she lost again, but it would be more humiliating if she continued. However, she held a grudge against Gu Ning from then on.

“Wow, Goddess Gu is so cool!”

“I’m her fan now.”

“...”

People kept complimenting Gu Ning.

“Why do you call her Goddess Gu?” Someone was curious.

“Hard to explain. You can search her name on the Internet yourself,” SWAT A said.

Other people heard and took out their phones at once. Their attitude towards Gu Ning changed in an instant after reading the news about her.

Du Jingtong didn’t search Gu Ning’s name, but heard their discussion about Gu Ning, and she was quite displeased.

Gu Ning was much prettier, stronger, and even richer than her.

She felt like there was a huge gap between her and Gu Ning. It seemed she wasn’t even qualified to be jealous of Gu Ning. Why could Gu Ning be so outstanding at such an early age?

Du Jingtong enjoyed the feeling of always being the most noticeable one among her peers, but Gu Ning’s appearance ruined everything. She felt like she wasn’t worth mentioning before Gu Ning.

“Alright, we should go back to the office now,” Li Zhongwei said. They were going to talk about something serious.

After that, they went back to the office together, followed by Gu Ning.

SWAT A wanted to talk with Gu Ning for a while longer, but it wasn’t appropriate to stop her right now, so he gave up. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Li Zhongwei walked slower and said to Du Jingtong in a low voice, “I know you’re in a terrible mood now because I turned to Gu Ning for help, but this task is very important. We must make sure that we succeed.”

“Leader, are you doubting my ability?” Du Jingtong asked. “I know she’s far better than me at martial arts, but it doesn’t mean she can fulfill this task better than me.”

“I understand, but Gu Ning is a better choice than you. You just had a competition with her, and you should know it as well,” Li Zhongwei said.

Du Jingtong closed her mouth, because she couldn’t deny it. Besides, it was their team leader’s decision, so she could only accept it.

“I know you don’t like Gu Ning, but she isn’t someone you can mess with. No matter how annoyed you are, you must control your temper and don’t cause her any trouble,” Li Zhongwei said.

“I won’t,” Du Jingtong replied.

When they were back in the office, Li Zhongwei said, “It’s 5 pm now, so we should put on our casual clothes for dinner first, my treat this time. Gu Ning will wear her clothing later and I’ll contact the clubhouse. Once the cruise ship is parked at the wharf, we’ll set off.”

“Sure!” Everyone agreed, then went to prepare.

“Miss Gu, please go to buy a dress and a pair of high-heels with me in the shopping mall. You also need to put on some make-up. Don’t worry, I’ll pay the bills. Remember to wear tight short pants under your dress because you need to fight,” Li Zhongwei said.

“It’s fine, I have clothes and shoes of my own, and I can do the make-up on my own too,” Gu Ning said.

“Are you sure?” Li Zhongwei asked.

“Yeah, it’s not a big deal,” Gu Ning said.

“Great!” Since she said that, Li Zhongwei didn’t insist.

When everyone was prepared, they left together.

“Miss Gu, do you want anything specific to eat?” Li Zhongwei asked Gu Ning, because Gu Ning was their guest.

“I’m not picky, and you can decide,” Gu Ning said.

“Alright.” Li Zhongwei didn’t ask further.

Since they had a guest today, Li Zhongwei thought that they should go to a fine restaurant tonight. Therefore, Li Zhongwei brought them to a famous fancy restaurant.

“Oh, thank you so much, Miss Gu. It’s because of you that we can dine in such a fancy restaurant tonight.”

“We only dined in street diners before!”

“Ha-ha, ha-ha.”

They kept joking about it.
