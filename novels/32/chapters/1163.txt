Chapter 1164 Not an Advertisemen

A short while later, Gu Ning received Bai Xueyan’s call.Bai Xueyan called Gu Ning because she had obviously heard that Gu Ning was in City G.

It was a Sunday, and Bai Xueyan was free from school, so she hung out with her friends that morning.

When she came home, she found her grandfather, Master Bai, in a very good mood, so she asked for the reason.

Master Bai then told her that Gu Ning was in City G now and Bai Xueyan went to call Gu Ning at once.

The moment Gu Ning answered her call, she complained in annoyance, “Gu Ning, why didn’t you tell me that you’re in City G now? Aren’t we friends?”

“I called Grandpa Bai this morning, but you weren’t home. I didn’t want to interrupt you, so I didn’t call you. We can see each other later,” Gu Ning said.

“Alright,” Bai Xueyan said and her anger was relieved.

“Where are you right now?” she asked.

“I’m in a café. Do you want to meet me earlier?” Gu Ning asked.

It was only 3:30 pm, and their appointed time was 6 pm.

Gu Ning had nothing else to deal with, so she went to have a seat with Gao Yi and Qiao Ya in a café.

“Sure! Tell me the address. I’m coming!” Bai Xueyan’s eyes lit up.

Gu Ning then told Bai Xueyan the location of the café, and Bai Xueyan arrived in 20 minutes.

“Gu Ning, who are they?” Bai Xueyan didn’t know Gao Yi and Qiao Ya, so she asked Gu Ning.

“They’re both my secretaries and bodyguards, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya,” Gu Ning said.

“Hi, nice to meet you!” Bai Xueyan greeted them.

Although they were just secretaries and bodyguards, Bai Xueyan still showed her respect.

“Nice to meet you too, Miss Bai,” Gao Yi and Qiao Yan politely said.

After that, Gu Ning began to chat with Bai Xueyan.

Bai Xueyan mentioned Allan in their conversation, and that she hadn’t seen him for a long time.

Gu Ning thought that Allan must be busy dealing with his business, because he was the president of Technology Company G of Country Y after all.

Bai Xueyan didn’t know that Allan was running a large company. She thought that he was only an ordinary businessman.

Gu Ning smiled and said nothing further about Allan. In Allan’s eyes, Bai Xueyan was simply a naughty child.

...

When it was almost the appointed time, they went to the restaurant together.

As the host, Gu Ning was supposed to arrive earlier than her guests, so she arrived at 5:20 pm.

Master Bai and his friends came at 5:30 pm.

They greeted each other the second they met one another.

“Girl Gu, I heard your business is growing increasingly big, and the famous clothing brand, Charm, is also yours, right?” Master Fu asked.

They had learned about it from the news conference.

“Ha-ha, Girl Gu is a talented businesswoman. I’m not surprised that her business could be so successful,” Master Bai said with great pride.

It sounded as if Gu Ning was his granddaughter.

After talking for a while, Gu Ning told Gao Yi to present the gifts she prepared for Master Bai and the other masters.

“You already invite us to share this meal together. Why did you still bring gifts for us,” Master Bai said.

Gu Ning smiled. “Well, these are bottles of nutritious liquid for aged people produced by Colaine, and they are good for your health.”

Gu Ning bought them from the Colaine store in City G.

“There is nutritious liquid for different people of different ages as well, so you can let your family members try it if you think it’s effective,” Gu Ning said.

It wasn’t an advertisement, Gu Ning said that for the sake of their health.

“I’ve heard of Colaine, and many people say its medical and skincare products are really good,” Bai Xueyan said.

Bai Xueyan often surfed on the Internet, so she read a lot of news about Colaine, but she didn’t know that Gu Ning was its boss.

“Yeah, they’re indeed very good, and you can tell your mother to try Kouzi,” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning had everything in the telepathic eye space, but she couldn’t take out a set of skincare products from it right now. Anyway, Kouzi wasn’t expensive, and Mrs. Bai could afford it.

Although Kouzi was going to be an International high-end brand, its current prices were still acceptable for most consumers.

“Sure!” Bai Xueyan said.

Since it was Gu Ning’s recommendation, Bai Xueyan easily accepted it.

“Girl Gu, does Colaine belong to you too?” Master Yan suddenly asked.

Hearing that, the others turned to look at Gu Ning with surprise.

Gu Ning smiled and said, “Right, Colaine belongs to me, but I didn’t come here today to do an ad for it. It really is very effective, so I recommended it to you all.”

She sincerely hoped that her friends could be healthy and beautiful at the same time.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
