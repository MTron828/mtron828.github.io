Chapter 2460: Please Forgive Us

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting weren’t looking for trouble, but they felt that the group of people were bad guys. If they wanted to do something bad, they would give them the chance so that they could punish them.

If the group of men didn’t attack them today, other people might become the victims. Therefore, since they ran into them today, they wouldn’t mind teaching them a lesson.

Anyway, they were free now. Moreover, Leng Shaoting was a soldier, so he couldn’t ignore it when he ran into bad guys.

Besides, those men were obviously good at fighting. Although they weren’t that strong, they could easily harm ordinary people.

The group of men had a quiet discussion after they saw that Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to sit across from them.

“How about them?”

“They are wearing expensive clothes. They must be rich.”

“Why don’t we choose them?”

“It’s not a bad idea.”

“Great, we’ll target them first.”

Their voices were so low that even people around the next table couldn’t hear them, but Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting did. Now they were sure that they were being targeted. And it seemed that they wanted money.

After Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting sat down, they ordered some roasted meat. Gu Ning then saw shrimp, so she ordered a serving for herself. Leng Shaoting disliked seafood, so he could eat the roasted meat.

“Want some beer?” Gu Ning asked. They wouldn’t get drunk since they simply drank for fun, but every table was drinking, so if they didn’t drink, it would be strange.

“Why not!” Leng Shaoting didn’t care about that. After all, they could easily get rid of the effects of the alcohol with their magical power.

“How many do you want?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“Each of us can have two bottles,” said Gu Ning.

After that, Leng Shaoting ordered four bottles of beer.

It took some time for the roasted meat to be done. As for the shrimp, because they were boiled, they were soon placed on the table.

Before Gu Ning did anything, Leng Shaoting peeled a shrimp and put it into her bowl.

Gu Ning gave him a smile, then let him do the work. She poured each of them a glass of beer, and drank together with Leng Shaoting.

After drinking a few glasses, the roasted meat was done.

While Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were enjoying the meat, the group of men glanced at them every now and then. Ordinary people might not notice it, but Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting quickly sensed it.

They didn’t eat slowly, so they soon finished the food. Afterwards, they settled the bill and left.

Seeing that, the group of men followed them.

After they targeted Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting, they had stopped drinking and eating. However, because Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning didn’t finish yet, they pretended to eat more. They didn’t drink more, because they were afraid that it might affect their actions.

The street was full of people, so it wasn’t strange that they swaggered behind Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning, but Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were already aware that they didn’t have good intentions.

However, because they intended to give them the chance, they didn’t take a taxi when they left. Instead, they wandered hand in hand.

It was nearly 1 am, so not many people were walking around on the main road.

It was the best chance for the group of men since they had no idea that they were already exposed.

‘When there was no one around, they suddenly sped up and ran to surround Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting subconsciously protected Gu Ning behind him. Although he knew that Gu Ning could easily defeat the hoodlums, he still wanted to protect her.

“What do you want?” Leng Shaoting asked calmly, not sounding afraid at all.

“Give us all your money, or we’ll beat the sh*t out of you!”

“and, leave your girl to us for a night, and we’ll let you go.” They leered at Gu Ning.

She was so beautiful that they couldn’t let her go!

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting wouldn’t be too mad if they just robbed them, but Gu Ning was mad since they even had the intention to rape her. Leng Shaoting lost control of his anger, and directly attacked them.

They were surprised that Leng Shaoting would suddenly attack them and at such a high speed, so before they could even react, they were beaten on the ground.

Even though a few of them at the back came back to their senses, they were no match for Leng Shaoting. With a single move, Leng Shaoting swiftly beat them down too, to the point that they could barely get back to their feet.

The group of men were totally shocked. To their astonishment, Leng Shaoting was so strong. Clearly they had made a terrible mistake today.

“Please, please stop…” Because Leng Shaoting was too strong, they didn’t dare to fight back and immediately begged for his forgiveness.

“Please, please let us go!”

If they didn’t beg for his mercy, they would only suffer.

“Let you go? Didn’t you want to rob us?” Leng Shaoting said coldly.

“We’re sorry. It was a stupid mistake. We promise it won’t happen again. Please let us go this time!”

“Please, please let us go.”

Leng Shaoting said nothing, but walked to one of them. The man was the one who asked Leng Shaoting to leave Gu Ning to them for a night.

He didn’t bother to hurt the others, because they were already injured and would have to stay in bed for at least a week. However, he wouldn’t let go of this man, who asked him to leave Gu Ning to them for a night.

The man also realized that his words had angered Leng Shaoting, so he shrank and begged again. “P-Please… No!”

Before he could finish, Leng Shaoting kicked him in the crotch and he screamed in pain.

He wasn’t disabled, but the pain would probably last for a month, because it was the most vulnerable part of a man’s body. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The man tightly covered his crotch and shrank from the pain. Witnessing that, the other men also subconsciously covered their crotches, in case they suffered the same treatment.

His scream was unusually loud in the night, which scared pedestrians, causing several of the passers-by to turn and see a few men lying on the ground and two people standing over them..
