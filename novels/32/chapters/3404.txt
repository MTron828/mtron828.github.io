3405 Is It So Hard to Admit That Others Are Amazing?

The press conference held by Xiaoyao Technology for the new game, Who’s the Ruler, was scheduled for Saturday, which was in three days.

During the military training, there would be no rest on Saturday. Only Sunday was a day off.

Nevertheless, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t choose to hold it on Sunday due to other factors. It wasn’t just decided according to her own schedule. It mainly depended on the media’s schedule.

Their work had already been arranged for Sunday, so only Saturday was available.

Originally, leave wasn’t allowed during military training, unless there was a health problem, but when the instructor heard about her entrepreneurship and the upcoming game launch, he came to ask her about it. She admitted it and casually treated him to a meal. Unexpectedly, the instructor agreed.

The instructor also treated Leng Xiaoyao differently. Although Leng Xiaoyao was being criticized recently, he still believed in her.

Three days before the press conference, Xiaoyao Technology’s official Weibo released several promotional materials.

There were video ads, images, and posters.

Due to Leng Xiaoyao’s influence, Xiaoyao Technology’s official Weibo had gained thousands of followers.

However, when Xiaoyao Technology’s official Weibo released the advertisement and was reposted by Xiao Yuming, the number of followers of Xiaoyao Technology’s official Weibo skyrocketed.

It wasn’t surprising. Xiao Yuming was honestly popular. He not only had tens of millions of fans, he also had a good relationship with many other artists and employees of entertainment companies. Those who knew him were all liking and reposting. Therefore, their fans were also following and reposting.

As a result, Xiaoyao Technology’s official Weibo, which had only a few thousand followers, reached over a hundred thousand followers within two hours after the advertisement was released. It became one of the hottest topics on Weibo within three hours.

Leng Xiaoyao originally wanted to make some moves to get the game advertisement on the hot search, but it turned out that Xiao Yuming helped her out.

She had to admit that Xiao Yuming was indeed incredibly popular. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At first, they followed because of their relationship with Xiao Yuming and their idol worship. They didn’t really have high expectations for this game. After all, there had been many games in recent years, but only a few were popular.

Therefore, most people didn’t have high hopes for this game, even if it was endorsed by Xiao Yuming.

However, after seeing the promotional video of the game, they were attracted by the game clips in the video. They wouldn’t know if it was good or not until it was fully launched, so many netizens were waiting for it and would download and play it once it was available.

When the students who followed Xiaoyao Technology at the Capital University found out about it, it was already after the end of military training in the afternoon. They were all shocked.

At first, there weren’t many people who had high expectations for Leng Xiaoyao, but they didn’t expect that Leng Xiaoyao’s actions would shock them.

The game spokesperson for Leng Xiaoyao’s company turned out to be the best actor of this year, Xiao Yuming.

“Oh my God! Are you kidding me? The spokesperson is Xiao Yuming! Did I read it wrong?”

“I can’t believe it. Who is Leng Xiaoyao? How did she manage to get Xiao Yuming to endorse her game? This can’t be done with money alone! She must have connections.”

“No wonder Leng Xiaoyao is so confident. It seems that she has some abilities! ”

“I just don’t know how good this game is.”

“I think it should be good. Otherwise, why would Xiao Yuming endorse it? Even if there are connections, if it’s not good, wouldn’t it ruin his reputation?”

“That’s true. Moreover, the game clips in the promotional video look very good and eye-catching. When it’s available for download, I’ll download it and try it out.”

“No matter what, Leng Xiaoyao has already succeeded halfway by getting this far.”

“It seems that we’ve really underestimated Leng Xiaoyao.”

Although there were doubts, many people were looking forward to this game.

Those who previously envied and resented Leng Xiaoyao didn’t change their views on her because of her abilities. Instead, they became even more jealous.

Like Fan Xiaoyu and He Xiaoxiao who spread this news.

What Leng Xiaoyao said in class was spread by He Xiaoxiao to make fun of her.

She didn’t expect that she had given Leng Xiaoyao some free advertisement.

Although many people didn’t have high expectations before and even despised her, at least her popularity at the Capital University was spread out.

After this news was spread, some people came to ask Leng Xiaoyao about it.

Leng Xiaoyao replied. “Is it really that hard to admit that others are amazing? At first, you all came to question me. Now you all come to confirm it. What do you want? I said I could do it and you didn’t believe me. I said I would do it and you questioned me again. Since that’s the case, why bother asking?”

Her words embarrassed them.

Indeed, Leng Xiaoyao said that she could do and would do it, but they still questioned her. Wasn’t that their fault?

There were still some people who doubted it in private and said that no one knew if the game would be popular or not.

However, based on the fact that they were proven wrong before, even if there were still doubts now, no one dared to say it in front of Leng Xiaoyao.

About the news. Their head teacher personally came to talk to Leng Xiaoyao the next day and praised her.

All teachers like capable students, unless they have interest conflicts.

In fact, the instructor even approached Leng Xiaoyao about it.

“Leng Xiaoyao, although I had confidence in you from the very beginning, I’m still surprised by the publicity. It’s very good.”

“Thank you, sir.” Leng Xiaoyao thanked him for his praise, then casually asked, “Can I take a day off the day after tomorrow for my company’s press conference?”

“Sure.” The instructor didn’t even think about it and agreed directly.

To be honest, Leng Xiaoyao was a bit surprised, because before the military training, it was said that as long as there were no physical problems, one couldn’t take a leave of absence. Therefore, she didn’t have any hope of getting a leave of absence!

After all, this was the Capital University, not the Experimental High School in City Chang.

As a freshman, she didn’t have the confidence to ask a teacher or instructor for a leave of absence!

“Thank you, sir.” Leng Xiaoyao thanked him joyfully.

It wasn’t easy to take a leave of absence from the Capital University, but Leng Xiaoyao had deeply impressed the instructor! It was rare to see such an outstanding student.

Besides, she took a leave of absence to do something serious, not to hang out.

After Leng Xiaoyao finished her military training and returned home, it was already 7 pm. Because it was summer, it was still bright outside.

Leng Xiaoyao was too lazy to cook, so she ate outside before coming back.

Li Mochen gave her the key to his house so that she could find the two ghosts.

Because they could only pass through walls as Qing Ghosts, they couldn’t leave Li Mochen’s basement.

When it got dark, Leng Xiaoyao went to release them and took them out to see the world.

Because of Leng Xiaoyao’s warning, they didn’t dare to absorb the humans’ energy casually.

Being around humans for a short time wouldn’t cause any harm. Otherwise, Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t take them to crowded places.
