Chapter 372 The Air of Rich People

The changes in Gu Qing and Gu Man were too obvious to be ignored, and everyone was impressed and stunned. Especially Lin Lijuan and Wen Yulan; as women, they were both jealous of Gu Qing and Gu Man.

Lin Lijuan then said acidly, “Oh, you’re rich now, so you all have the air of rich people.”

“Rich? Are they richer than my uncle?” Gu Qingshi asked. He acted arrogant because he didn’t believe that Gu Ning’s family was richer than Gu Qinxiang’s family.

“Exactly!” Gu Yinyin echoed.

Gu Yinyin and Gu Qingshi were both young, and didn’t know much about their family conflicts. They had only heard that Gu Man and Gu Qing’s family were rich now, but had no idea how rich they were.

“Qingshi, Yinyin, shut your mouths!” Gu Qinyang criticized them. He didn’t want to annoy Gu Ning, and wouldn’t allow his son and daughter to do so. Gu Yinyin and Gu Yinyin felt aggrieved, but had to listen to their father.

“So what? You did the same thing before, so why don’t you continue doing it?” Gu Ning retorted directly.

“You...” Lin Lijuan was mad.

Gu Qingyun understood that Gu Ning was different now, but he still believed that she was inferior to them. Seeing Gu Ning being so proud, Gu Qingyun was furious. “Gu Ning, how dare you talk to my mother like that!”

“Gu Qingyun, who do you think you are? And why can’t I talk to your mother like that?” Gu Ning sneered, which irritated Gu Qingyun.

Gu Qingyun abruptly stood up, like he was going to punch Gu Ning.

“Alright! Sit down now!” At this moment, Gu Qinxiang stopped his son. He was also unwilling to annoy Gu Ning and the others, because he couldn’t bear the result.

Gu Qinxiang had warned his family not to find fault with Gu Ning and the others like they had done before, so Gu Qingyun had to listen to his father and curbed his anger for now. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Have a seat, you all!” Gu Qinxiang said to Jiang Xu and the others.

Jiang Xu and the others sat down afterwards. When they were just seated, the dishes were placed on the table one by one.

The old lady was unusually polite this time, but they all knew that it wouldn’t last long, because it was all an act. Without surprise, the old lady opened her mouth after the dishes were all on the table, “Jiang Xu, you really kept it a deep secret and none of us found out that you’re a big boss until Qinxiang met you in the hotel. What? You’re rich now, so you’re going to abandon us?” The old lady took it for granted that Jiang Xu owed them.

Jiang Xu hadn’t run his business for very long, but he wasn’t weak anymore. Gu Ning had also reminded him to be confident and never yield. Otherwise, those shameless people would take full advantage of them. Therefore, Jiang Xu became tough now to protect his family. Thus facing the old lady’s harsh questions, Jiang Xu stayed calm and argued, “You must be joking! If we were going to abandon you, we wouldn’t have come here today. And we’ve always lived our life separately. Nobody cares about each other, so why should I tell you what I’m doing now?” In other words, it was none of their business.

“You...” The old lady was stunned. Although she knew that Jiang Xu’s explanation made sense, she couldn’t accept it. “Well, do you mean that it’s not your filial duty to support your-mother-in-law?” The old lady still believed that she had the right to share Jiang Xu’s money.

“Mom, we respect you as always! We have never missed a red envelope for you during any festival. Isn’t it enough?” Jiang Xu asked. Jiang Xu was telling the truth. Although Gu Qing and Gu Man had been poor in the old time, they had never forgotten to prepare a red envelope for the old lady.

“It’s different now! You’re rich and you’re supposed to give me more!” The old lady lost her patience and removed her disguise. She never liked the red envelopes that Gu Qing and Gu Man had prepared for her, because there wasn’t much money inside, but she had still taken them out of greed.

“Mom, do you really lack money? Qinxiang is very rich, so it’s unreasonable that you’re short of money!” Jiang Xu said. Obviously, he aimed at Gu Qinxiang. In fact, Jiang Xu understood that Gu Qinxiang wouldn’t treat his mother badly, because he was a filial son, although he treated his brothers and sisters unfairly. Thus, Jiang Xu only said it to criticize the old lady.

“You...” The old lady was furious. Gu Qinxiang of course supported her well, but it didn’t mean that she would stop wanting more.

“Jiang Xu, it doesn’t make sense. Even though mom doesn’t lack money, shouldn’t you be a filial son-in-law and take good care of our mother?” Lin Lijuan said, like it was really Jiang Xu’s fault.

“Ok, why don’t you tell me what you and your husband have done for your mother, so that I can learn from you?” Jiang Xu said sarcastically. He knew that a selfish man like Gu Qinxiang definitely wouldn’t support his mother-in-law, and the old lady was too mean to allow Gu Qinxiang and Lin Lijuan to give Lin Lijuan’s family anything. In that case, Lin Liyuan had no position to blame Jiang Xu.

However, in the old lady’s eyes, she thought that Gu Qinxiang and Lin Lijuan had to have secretly given Lin Lijuan’s family something behind her back, so she was mad at once. “Lijuan, did you secretly give your mother money from our pocket?” It was unbearable if Lin Lijuan did that.

“Mom, I didn’t!” Lin Lijuan immediately denied, but she was lying

Although Lin Lijuan denied it, the old lady still warned her, “Listen, you married my son, and you’re part of our family now. Never take money out of our pocket to support your relatives!”

“Sure I won’t,” Lin Lijuan said, but didn’t take it seriously.

“Ha-ha!” Gu Ning laughed. “Since she married your son and is part of your family now. You don’t allow her to take money out of your pocket to support her relatives, so you shouldn’t ask your daughters to do the same thing. Don’t forget that your daughter is married too.”
