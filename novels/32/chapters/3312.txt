Mu Beihan couldn’t give Leng Xiaoyao a big hug right away because there were other people present.

Leng Xiaoyao was amused by Mu Beihan’s reaction and replied. “Don’t worry, follow me and I’ll give you all the best.”

“What industry do you plan to join?” Wu Wensi asked.

“I bought a technology company that was about to go bankrupt in City Chang. It still has some foundation. If the founders hadn’t been schemed against by their partner, they could have been doing better and better,” Leng Xiaoyao said confidently.

“Do you have any knowledge about this industry?” Wu Wensi asked, though not because he questioned Leng’s abilities. After all, even Li Mochen supported her, she must have the ability.

Even if she didn’t have the ability, she had a team! Leng Xiaoyao had said that the company she acquired had a foundation.

It was better to join a familiar industry.

“I won’t easily get involved in fields I’m not good at,” Leng Xiaoyao said, indicating that she knew the industry well.

Wu Wensi didn’t ask any further and went on to discuss the renovation with Leng Xiaoyao.

Leng Xiaoyao showed him the floor plan first before discussing other details.

“Do you have any requirements for the decoration?” Wu Wensi asked.

“I don’t have any special requirements. After all, I’m not a professional. I will have to rely on your advice. I trust your vision and ability. How about we go directly to the construction site tomorrow morning and discuss it in detail? If possible, you can bring some case studies from your team for me to look at and we can finalize the style. Also, I hope the renovation can be done within two months. It’s okay to hire more people and pay more. Of course, I also hope that you can give me a discount for Brother Mochen’s sake,” Leng Xiaoyao said. After all, it would cost a lot of money. Even if she could afford it, it would still be better to save some money.

“No problem! I can give you a discount. So, we can go to the construction site and have a look first. With more people, the renovation of 826 square meters can be done within two months. After we’ve seen the construction site tomorrow, I’ll start designing for you immediately. Even if I rush it, I will need three or four days to finish the design,” Wu Wensi said.

“After we finish dinner, do you want to go to the club?” Mu Yiyang asked. He hadn’t been there for a long time and wanted to go.

“I have no problem.” Wu Wensi replied.

Li Mochen didn’t answer, but looked at Leng Xiaoyao instead. He was seeking her opinion.

Everyone was puzzled by his behavior and felt that there was something going on between them.

“Okay!” Leng Xiaoyao responded. Anyway, there was nothing else to do.

After the meal, everyone was happy.

Wu Wensi learned more about Leng Xiaoyao.

He was already shocked by Leng Xiaoyao’s ability to make money in stocks and start a company at a young age, but he didn’t expect Leng Xiaoyao to also be a top student and skilled in car racing.

Wu Wensi wasn’t a person who cared about face too much, so he treated Leng Xiaoyao as an idol and kept toasting her.

Although Li Mochen was happy that his friends accepted Leng Xiaoyao, he became unhappy when the enthusiasm became too much. “She’s too young to drink much.”

Wu Wensi trembled and dared not toast Leng Xiaoyao anymore.

He sipped his drink slowly, feeling dissatisfied.

Leng Xiaoyao also felt the same way, but she didn’t argue with Li Mochen.

…

At 7 pm, the news started. Leng Changyuan was excitedly waiting in front of the TV because today’s news would feature the national championship for the High School Liberal Arts Defense. Leng Xiaoyao was the champion, so she would be interviewed.

Although Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng knew the result yesterday, they were still excited to see Leng Xiaoyao being interviewed on TV and praised her endlessly.

However, Leng Yehua and Song Meiyu didn’t look happy, especially Song Meiyu.

Song Meiyu looked at Leng Xiaoyao on TV and wanted to glare a hole through it.

She really missed the old Leng Xiaoyao before she changed. She was bad at studying, had acne all over her face, had a bad personality, and was simply unpleasant in every aspect.

That kind of Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t have stolen Leng Yuqi’s limelight. Even if Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng always favored her, at least the impact on them wouldn’t become that great.

After becoming beautiful, good at studying, and good at everything, Leng Xiaoyao became a nightmare for their family, especially after Leng Yuqi was betrayed by Chu Jianan.

Although the betrayal had nothing to do with Leng Xiaoyao, Song Meiyu still blamed her for it.

In fact, it came out because of Leng Xiaoyao, so she didn’t deny it.

Leng Xiaoyao’s outstanding face and championship title left an indelible mark on countless people’s hearts and made her an instant hit.

In just a few hours, Leng Xiaoyao’s name became a hot topic on Weibo.

If it was just news of a high school student winning the national championship in the Liberal Arts Defense, it would only cause a small stir. What really made Leng Xiaoyao popular was her beautiful face.

…

Back to Li Mochen. Enemies always seemed to cross paths easily.

Although Li Mochan didn’t frequently visit the capital city, he had encountered acquaintances a few times, but enemies were more common.

This time, as soon as they finished their meal and left the restaurant, they ran into Li Xiaoyang.

Along with Li Xiaoyang were Zheng Haoding and Feng Yiyan, whom Leng Xiaoyao had met once before, but there were two other people she didn’t know.

When Li Mochan appeared, Li Xiaoyang was immediately displeased and became furious. He had been holding a grudge against Li Mochan’s bodyguards for throwing him out of a hotel last time.

If it had been someone he didn’t know treating him like that, he would still be angry and hold a grudge, let alone someone he had always disliked like Li Mochan!

His jealousy grew even stronger when he saw Li Mochan forming a close relationship with Mu Yiyang and Wu Wensi.

Even though his friends were all from first or second-rate aristocratic families and wealthy households, birds of a feather flocked together. They were all a group of people who only knew how to eat, drink, and have fun, without any great accomplishments.

Both the Li family and the Mu family were first-rate aristocratic families, but most of the Mu family descendants had achieved something. For example, Mu Yiyang had made a name for himself in the military. Meanwhile, Li Xiaoyang couldn’t even last a few years and asked to go home.

As for Wu Wensi, he was also a young heir from a second-rate wealthy family. He invested in building the high-end villa area Hanlin Manor, where many powerful and wealthy people lived. However, the Li family couldn’t even afford one of the houses inside.

Li Mochan was hanging out with these people, so he could benefit from their relationship.
