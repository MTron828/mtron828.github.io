Chapter 106: The Large Iceberg, Leng Shaoting

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“What? She turned it off? How dare she!” The old lady was irritated. In her eyes, Gu Man should always abase herself before her.

“Why don’t you call Gu Qing?” Lin Lijuan proposed.

Hearing that, Gu Qinxiang immediately called Gu Qing.

Seeing Gu Qinxiang’s call, Gu Qing knew he must be calling for Gu Man.

Although Gu Qing stood by Gu Man, she personally didn’t have many arguments with Gu Qinxiang. Thus she answered. Besides, she also wanted to know the reason why Gu Qinxiang called Gu Man. She wanted to be prepared.

“Gu Qing, is Gu Man with you?” The minute Gu Qing answered the phone, Gu Qinxiang opened his mouth and said with an unfriendly tone.

“No,” Gu Qing said.

“Call Gu Man, and get her to call me back,” Gu Qinxiang ordered.

Gu Qing felt like laughing. They always took them as their servants, and ordered them to do everything like they were their masters. Gu Qinxiang was used to it, but Gu Qing was mad. She asked, “For what?”

“It’s none of your business. Just follow my order,” Gu Qinxiang replied.

“I can tell her that you called, but I won’t force her to call you back,” Gu Qing said, then she hung up directly with anger. After a break, she said to Gu Man, “Our eldest brother wants to talk to you. I don’t think that he has anything good on his mind.”

“I won’t talk to him,” Gu Man said. No matter what happened to Gu Qinxiang, it had nothing to do with her. Unless her mother had an accident then she would fulfill her duty.

Gu Qinxiang was annoyed once more, because Gu Qing had hung up on him. He couldn’t believe that Gu Qing dared to do that.

“I don’t think Gu Man will call you back. Why don’t we go and find her at her work tomorrow?” Lin Lijuan said.

Gu Qinxiang agreed. Since Gu Man wouldn’t answer his call, she was unlikely to call him back. “Then you go find her tomorrow!” Gu Qinxiang said to Lin Lijuan.

In the V5 bar.

Around 10 pm, Gu Ning received a message. She had a look. It was from Leng Shaoting, but she had changed his name into “The Large Iceberg”.

There was a faint smile on her lips. She knew that Leng Shaoting wanted the gun back, but she didn’t plan to give it back to him easily. She wanted to let him pay for it. She didn’t want to hurt him, but just wanted to have a little fun.

She opened the message.

The Large Iceberg: “When are you free tomorrow? I’ll take it back.”

Gu Ning: “Ain’t free tomorrow.”

The Large Iceberg: “Then when are you free?”

Gu Ning: “No idea.”

Leng Shaoting didn’t send a message back for a long time. Gu Ning was slightly pissed off.

Was he mad? She thought. If he was mad, he would be so easy to annoy! How could he be so cold? Wasn’t he supposed to be friendly and even beg her for the gun?

“What’s up?” Qin Yifan noticed Gu Ning was texting. She was happy at first, then suddenly looked displeased. Qin Yifan felt uneasy somehow.

“Nothing,” Gu Ning answered. She laid her phone on the table, but she was slightly unhappy. She drank the other half of the fruit wine, then she poured another glass of it.

Seeing that, Qin Yifan frowned a little. He sensed that something must be wrong, but it wasn’t convenient for him to ask.

Actually, Leng Shaoting wasn’t mad. He simply didn’t know how to reply. He wasn’t a man who was skilful at chatting.

Gu Ning said that she had no idea, what else could he possibly say?

Xu Jinchen, who sat aside, glanced at Leng Shaoting, who was texting, from time to time. He was so curious to know whether he was texting with Gu Ning, and what they were talking about. However, he didn’t dare to ask, or have a look. He felt so uncomfortable with his burning curiosity.

Leng Shaoting gave him a cold glance. Xu Jinchen immediately sat straight back.

After a long time, Leng Shaoting sent a message out again. When can you be free? I won’t be staying long in City F.

Gu Ning saw a new message coming in. Qin Yifan saw it too, but he only saw the sender’s name was “The Large Iceberg”. Who was “The Large Iceberg”? It seemed like a man’s nickname.

Gu Ning took her phone and clicked it open.

Although she intended to cause him some troubles, she didn’t want to go too far. It was her fault after all. Besides, she had a good impression of military officers, or she admired them. Even though Leng Shaoting was cold, he was so extraordinarily handsome, which also left a great impression on Gu Ning.

She then texted, “Monday! Buy me a great meal before getting the gun!”

Leng Shaoting received the message. Without further thinking, he sent an affirmative answer back. The gun was the most important thing in his eyes.

After that, Gu Ning was delighted again. Qin Yifan felt very curious but was nervous at the same time. He didn’t know what Gu Ning had spoken about with the man, but it seemed like a boyfriend and girlfriend who got back together after an argument.

Qin Yifan still didn’t fully know whether he fell in love with Gu Ning so he didn’t say anything.

“Shaoting, I’ve never seen you holding the phone and sending messages all the time. Who did you text?” Xu Jinchen couldn’t help but ask. He wanted to find out whether it was Gu Ning.

“A human being,” Leng Shaoting answered.

Xu Jinchen was speechless. A human being? Of course he knew it was a human being. The point was who was the human being? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Then who is the human being?” Xu Jinchen tried again.

“Why do you have to know?” Leng Shaoting ignored Xu Jinchen standing up and walked to the stairs.

Xu Jinchen clenched his teeth with upset. It was so hard to find out about Leng Shaoting’s little secret!

All of a sudden, an idea dawned on Xu Jinchen. He said, “Oh, I encountered Gu Ning on my way running in the morning yesterday! She is so funny. I think I kind of like her.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting stopped for a second, but just a second. Then he was gone without saying a word.

Although Xu Jinchen couldn’t see Leng Shaoting’s face, he assumed that there must be something going on between Gu Ning and him, because he had stopped for a second.
