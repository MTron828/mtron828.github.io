Chapter 390 I Can’t Tolerate It Anymore

Gu Ning immediately pulled Chu Peihan back and stopped her. “It’s Anya’s birthday party. Don’t fight.”

“It’s not me. It’s this hypocritical girl! Who do you think you are to find fault with our boss?” Chu Peihan said angrily.

“You...” Being humiliated by Chu Peihan, Jin Kexin flushed with anger. However, seeing that everyone was watching them, she suddenly had a scheme and put on an aggrieved face. “I just saw Miss Gu being so generous and I’ve never heard of a super-rich Gu family in City F, so I’m curious about Miss Gu’s family background. That’s all. Why do you have to get so mad? It’s not something shameful, unless...” In the end, Jin Kexin pretended that she suddenly realized something shocking, and closed her mouth at once to let others wonder.

If Gu Ning wasn’t from a super-rich family, and could afford such an expensive birthday gift, but refused to tell others her family background, it was enough for people to gossip.

Hearing what Jin Kexin had just said, some already started to gossip about Gu Ning.

“What? Does she have a sugar daddy?”

“No way! She’s so young!”

“Who knows!”

“You all shut up!” Hao Ran and Gu Ning’s other friends got angry hearing them gossiping, and they raised their voice with one accord.

Their loud voice attracted a lot more attention from the guests in the front hall. Almost all the attendees were walking or looking towards them.

Hao Ran glared at Jin Kexin and said angrily, “Jin Kexin, don’t think that just because you’re a relative of the Su family we won’t punch you!”

“Boss, I can’t tolerate it anymore, and I’m going to beat her!” Chu Peihan said and ran forward, but was stopped by Gu Ning again.

Even Gao Yi and Qiao Ya went to Gu Ning’s side without delay and stared at Jin Kexin unkindly. Jin Kexin was scared by their threatening looks.

“I didn’t say that; they said it!” Jin Kexin was terrified by Hao Ran and the others’ reaction, but she still acted as if she was the victim.

“What’s going on here?” Su Zhenhao walked towards them in a hurry and asked.

“Dad, Jin Kexin’s humiliating Gu Ning!” Su Anya said.

Hearing that, Su Zhenhao, along with other guests, all looked at Jin Kexin with unfriendly gazes.

“I’m not.” Jin Kexin was struck dumb by Su Zhenhao’s sharp look. However, before Su Zhenhao could say a word, Jin Kexin denied it. “I was just surprised by Miss Gu’s generosity, and I thought that she must be from a super-rich family, but I’ve never heard of the Gu family in City F, so I just asked Miss Gu’s family background out of curiosity. Unexpectedly, they’re so mad.”

Honestly, many people had the same thoughts and suspicion. None of them had heard of a super-rich Gu family in City F, so they were also curious about why Gu Ning could afford such an expensive gift.

“I don’t think there is anything wrong with what Kexin said. Why is it humiliating all of a sudden?” Jin Jingwei asked unhappily. Jin Kexin was his daughter, and he knew his daughter’s character. Jin Kexin had indeed picked on Gu Ning, but it wasn’t humiliating in his eyes.

It wasn’t a big problem if Jin Kexin asked directly, but she intentionally didn’t finish her sentence and made people wonder and gossip, which was a huge problem.

“Bullshit!” Hao Ran swore. He didn’t care that Jin Jingwei was much older than him and was a well-known businessman, but criticized him loudly. “Nothing wrong? Do you know what she had said beforehand? She deliberately made others believe that our boss has a sugar daddy!”

Hao Zhonglong and his wife didn’t stop Hao Ran’s inappropriate behavior. They were a family and their characters were alike. Therefore, they thought what Hao Ran was doing was right.

“You...” Jin Jingwei was mad at being humiliated by a young boy, but couldn’t retort. It was Jin Kexin’s fault after all. He then looked to Jin Kexin with blame in his eyes. He was blaming her for causing him trouble.

Jin Kexin was scared and pointed to several young girls. “They said it, not me!”

Those young girls were shocked and argued back. “You led us to!”

“You...” Jin Kexin was helpless.

Su Zhenhao and his wife were disappointed in Jin Kexin. To their astonishment, Jin Kexin who seemed cute and quiet normally was so evil. It would ruin a girl’s reputation if people thought that she had a sugar daddy.

“Jin Kexin, stop acting! Nobody believes you and we’re all clear about why you picked on Gu Ning. If you still have a sense of shame, apologize to Gu Ning right now. Otherwise, I’ll beat you down to the floor!” Chu Peihan threatened.

“Exactly, who do you think you are? Do you know every super-rich family in City F? Don’t flatter yourself!” Qin Zixun added.

“Do you think that you’re better than others just because you were born in a super-rich family? Do you earn your money? You’re just showing off with your parents’ money!” Hao Ran said.

Gu Ning’s friends were all criticizing Jin Kexin, even the guests disliked what she had done today.

Since it caught everyone’s attention, Gu Ning thought it was time to uncover her real identity to protect her reputation as a businesswoman. Gu Ning looked at Jin Kexin calmly and asked, “Can’t I be super-rich myself?”.

Although Jin Kexin was terrified amid the criticisms, she unconsciously retorted with disdain. “Keep bragging!”

“Miss Gu isn’t bragging. She gave Master Qin a highly valuable antique which is worth at least five million yuan!” someone said.

“Exactly. Girl Gu did send me a precious birthday gift,” Qin Haozheng said.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
