Chapter 459 Am I Good?

The original ingredients were acetaminophen, amantadine hydrochloride, caffeine, artificial bezoar, chlorpheniramine maleate, and now added power crystal. Of course, they wouldn’t mention power crystal on the composition table.

The ratio of power crystal to the original ingredients was 1-10. If the original ingredients weighed a kilogram, then the power crystal would be a hundred grams.

Hours later, the cold medicine was ready. After the second test, it showed nothing different from their old one, but its effect was greatly enhanced.

A worker who coincidentally had a cold would be the human guinea pig. Since they had already tested it twice, it wouldn’t be harmful, so the worker agreed. Once the pill was in his mouth, he felt a comfortable coldness spreading through his body. Within three minutes, he felt much better. The proportion of power crystal in this cold medicine wasn’t large, so he wouldn’t recover that quickly but its effect was already amazing enough.

As for the make-up production, Gu Ning decided to produce masks, creams, lotions, serum, and so on and the ratio would be 2-10.

Gu Ning talked with Ning Changkai for a while longer later, and told him to deal with the store and decoration as soon as possible.

Afterwards, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting left.

It was almost 5 pm when they left, so Gu Ning called Cao Wenxin and invited her to dine together.

Gu Ning had been busy all day, and Leng Shaoting didn’t have much time to be alone with her, but now Cao Wenxin would join them again. Leng Shaoting was a little unhappy, but didn’t say anything.

Gu Ning also understood that Leng Shaoting would rather be alone with her, but she couldn’t abandon Cao Wenxin in the hotel.

Tang Yunfan had been in City D for two days, and had also visited the university that Gu Man had studied in, as well as the place where he had the accident, but he still failed to remember anything. Tang Yunfan almost lost his patience.

In order to find some clues, Tang Yunfan flew to City F and went to the shopping mall where Kamei Beauty Salon was in. He wore a mask and hid in a corner, trying to catch glances of Gu Man.

Around 5:30 pm, Gu Man also got off work. Gu Qing was absent today, so she went home alone.

It was getting warmer after the New Year Festival, and it was a sunny day. Gu Man was in a dark brown woolen coat wearing light make-up with her hair casually tied up, and looked very elegant and noble.

When Tang Yunfan who was hidden in a corner saw Gu Man coming out of the salon, he was stunned and felt the strange intimacy again. However, he still couldn’t remember anything

Gu Man didn’t drive, and Gao Yi and Qiao Ya weren’t with her, so she took a taxi home. Tang Yunfan then drove a car, following her till Fenghua Luxury Mansion.

Gu Man was going to do grocery shopping in a nearby supermarket, so she got out outside of Fenghua Luxury Mansion.

There were three hoodlums fooling around. And when Gu Man appeared in their sight, they had an idea to rob her. They gave each other a knowing glance, then walked to Gu Man.

All of a sudden, one of them grabbed Gu Man’s handbag and ran away. Gu Man was very scared and shouted. “A robber!”

Gu Man wanted to chase him, but was afraid of getting hurt.

Tang Yunfan was following Gu Man all the way, so he immediately chased the thief.

Although Tang Yunfan had aged, he was still able to run and fight like a soldier from the Special Forces. Within minutes, he beat the three hoodlums down and took back Gu Man’s handbag. However, when Tang Yunfan walked to Gu Man with her handbag in his hand, he felt a little shy to look her in the eye.

“Thank you so much, sir!” Gu Man said sincerely.

Tang Yunfan said in a low voice, “You’re welcome.”

“Sir, if you don’t mind, may I invite you to share a meal with me? I want to thank you for your brave and kind behavior,” Gu Man said. Although they were merely strangers, he had helped her, so she was grateful.

“No need. Bye.” Tang Yunfan rejected, because he didn’t want her to see his face. After that, he turned around, walking to the sales hall of Fenghua Luxury Mansion. Tang Yunfan planned to buy an apartment here, especially one that was near Gu Man’s home.

Watching Tang Yunfan walking away from her, Gu Man suddenly felt like he was familiar, but she didn’t think further and went to the supermarket.

Tang Yunfan was lucky and bought a well-decorated apartment right opposite Gu Man’s home. In other words, he was able to see into the living room of Gu Man’s apartment.

Both Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin were leaving the capital the next day, and they would go to the airport together.

Gu Ning’s flight would take off at 1:50 pm, while Cao Wenxin’s was at 1:35 pm, so they would have lunch together before heading to the airport.

Cao Wenxin said to Gu Ning, “Ningning, my friend told me to thank you for what you did for Su Tongnuo.”

Su Tongnuo and Ai Xinyu were close friends while Ai Xinyu and Cao Wenxin were close friends too, so Cao Wenxin would love to thank Gu Ning for Ai Xinyu’s sake.

“No big deal. Su Tongnuo is the person I wanted to sign too,” Gu Ning said.

After grocery shopping, Gu Man went back home and cooked for herself.

In the opposite apartment, Tang Yunfan could sometimes see Gu Man walking through the living room.

During the night, Gu Man sat in the living room watching TV. Gu Qing came to chat with her for a while, and then left. Gu Man was alone again.

Seeing that Gu Man was alone and seemed lonely, Tang Yunfan felt uncomfortable and his heart ached for her. He wanted to keep her company, but he still couldn’t remember anything.

That night, Gu Ning barely slept, because Leng Shaoting wouldn’t let her sleep. Gu Ning was leaving tomorrow, and Leng Shaoting didn’t know when they would meet again so he wildly made love to her countless times. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Ningning, tell me. Am I good?” Every man wanted to be complimented about their sexual ability.
