3033 More and More Impressive

Leng Xiaoyao decided to climb into the building instead of taking the elevator, because if she wanted to see the inside of the room clearly, she had to do it from the window.

Xi Keyi lived on the 9th floor, which wasn’t too high, so Leng Xiaoyao easily climbed up.

Even if it wasn’t the 9th floor, and was the 90th floor, it wouldn’t be a difficulty for Leng Xiaoyao. After all, she wasn’t an ordinary girl, but a cultivator.

After easily climbing up to the 9th floor, she reached the window of the master bedroom. Although the curtain was closed, it wasn’t tightly closed. There was a gap large enough to see the bed.

!!

When she looked through, Leng Xiaoyao saw them having sex in the bed.

In fact, before she saw them, she had already heard their sounds.

Without hesitation, Leng Xiaoyao took out her phone and filmed what they were doing.

Although she knew Xi Keyi had an affair with Song Xiuyan, she was still furious when she saw them having sex.

What they were doing was humiliating Leng Yecheng.

After filming a few minutes, Leng Xiaoyao left.

She only needed evidence to prove that Xi Keyi was having an affair with Song Xiuyan. She was reluctant to watch them for a long time.

With the evidence, Leng Xiaoyao decided to tell Leng Yecheng about it tomorrow when she went to see him.

It was cruel to let Leng Yecheng know the truth, but it was crueler if he didn’t know.

Therefore, it was better to deal with painful things quickly.

Once Leng Xiaoyao left, she returned to the Leng family’s mansion.

Back in the Leng family’s mansion.

Leng Yuqi was still at the evening class, so Leng Changyuan knew that Leng Xiaoyao had skipped the evening class. However, he didn’t ask about it, because he trusted her.

“I heard you visited Daxing with your third uncle for a business deal. You did the presentation and amazed all of them. I heard that they thought you are very young and successful,” Leng Changyuan said. Honestly, when he heard the news, he was very surprised and excited.

Unexpectedly, Leng Xiaoyao was good at business too.

Hearing that, Song Meiyu was astonished.

What? Leng Xiaoyao visited Daxing with Leng Yecheng for a business deal? Leng Xiaoyao did the presentation and amazed all of them? They even said that she was young and successful?

Leng Xiaoyao was good at business as well?

Song Meiyu was still in shock since she heard that Leng Xiaoyao suddenly became good at fighting and studying. And now Leng Xiaoyao had made another achievement. It seemed she could do everything!

Did Leng Yecheng secretly train Leng Xiaoyao to prevent them from stealing Fengshang Design?

Looking at Leng Xiaoyao, Song Meiyu felt very threatened.

“Yeah, because Secretary Chen was seriously injured, I replaced him,” Leng Xiaoyao explained.

“Ha-ha, great! Yaoyao, you’re becoming more and more impressive. I even wonder if you might know everything!” Leng Changyuan beamed.

“I don’t know everything, but I do know a lot. I won’t deny it if you think I’m a genius, ha-ha.” Leng Xiaoyao joked, half seriously. However, it was the truth, so she wasn’t really bragging.

Hearing that, Leng Changyuan was even happier and believed her.

However, Song Meiyu was jealous and anxious now that Leng Xiaoyao became so impressive.

Would Leng Yecheng let Leng Xiaoyao take over Fengshang Design?

However, she was a girl who was going to marry into another family. If Leng Xiaoyao took over, Fengshang Design would become another family’s wealth. In that case, Leng Yuchen should take over.

Thinking of that, Song Meiyu hated Leng Xiaoyao.

“Well, if Xiaoyao can do business too, she can take over Fengshang Design in the future.” Song Meiyu put on a fake smile and said.

Leng Xiaoyao understood what Song Meiyu was thinking. Since Song Meiyu wanted to know, she decided to be honest.

“Fengshang Design was built by my mother, but when Uncle Yecheng took it over, it only had fifty million yuan in assets. Now it has over two hundred million yuan in assets. The credit should go to Uncle Yecheng. It has nothing to do with me. So, I have no qualifications to take over Fengshang Design. It should be Uncle Yecheng’s child who inherits it in the future. I’ll take 12% shares at that time. I think it’s already enough for me. With the dividend, I can get more than fifty million yuan every year. I believe Fengshang Design will become even more successful under Uncle Yecheng’s leadership. By then, I might even get five hundred million yuan,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Song Meiyu was extremely surprised. Surprisingly, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t have the intention of taking over Fengshang Design, but it was true that Leng Yecheng managed Fengshang Design very well, so it was successful now.

However, it was Leng Xiaoyao’s mother who built up Fengshang Design, would Leng Xiaoyao really be willing to give it to Leng Yecheng?

If she were Leng Xiaoyao, she wouldn’t, but since Leng Xiaoyao said that, she had nothing to say.

Leng Changyuan, on the other hand, was very comforted when Leng Xiaoyao made that decision, because it was reasonable.

He didn’t have a bias in favor of Leng Yecheng nor did he want to steal Leng Xiaoyao’s mother’s property, but Leng Yecheng had indeed spent a lot of energy in Fengshang Design.

In order to take it over, Leng Yecheng even gave up his own dream.

If he hadn’t taken over Fengshang Design that year, Fengshang Design would have been swallowed up or gone bankrupt.

Therefore, according to Leng Xiaoyao’s decision, both she and Leng Yecheng could benefit from it.

Song Meiyu said nothing else, and Leng Xiaoyao ignored her afterwards. She chatted with Leng Changyuan for a while, then went back to her room.

At noon, Leng Yuqi transferred ten thousand yuan to her bank account, so it was over, but the grudges between them worsened.

Even though Leng Xiaoyao had ended her engagement with Chu Jianan, she wouldn’t allow Leng Yuqi to get together with him smoothly.

She would stop them, however, not because she still loved Chu Jianan.

She ended their engagement because she had no affection for him and he had betrayed her.

She would stop them from being together successfully, in order to pay them back for what they had done to her. If she hadn’t gotten into Li Mochen’s room by accident, she would have fallen into an even worse situation.
