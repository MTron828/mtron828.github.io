Chapter 267: He Is My Boyfriend

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“As long as it’s safe, I don’t care about its price,” Gu Ning said. A factory wouldn’t be more expensive than the raw materials.

“Oh, how many workers do you have in your store?” Gu Ning asked.

“Three. One is an accountant, and the other two are responsible for cutting raw materials,” Zheng Peng answered.

“Please ask them whether they’re willing to join my company. I can pay them a good salary,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure, I will,” Zheng Peng said. Actually, he knew that they would agree even without having to ask.

Gu Ning and Zheng Peng finished their discussion for now, and they would talk more about the factory later after they signed the contract.

After that, they signed the contract for leasing the store and Gu Ning transferred a year’s rent to Zheng Peng. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

She needed to register her company first before she was going to be able to sign the labor contract.

When they walked out of Zheng Peng’s store, Leng Shaoting said to Gu Ning, “Let me help you with the registration.”

“Great!” Gu Ning didn’t reject. It would take a long time if she went to do it herself.

Gu Ning then handed all of the documents to Leng Shaoting. The name of her company was Colorful Jade Provider. She had done her homework beforehand, and the name wasn’t registered yet.

It was 5:30 pm already, so Leng Shaoting planned to deal with the registration tomorrow.

Gu Ning along with Leng Shaoting went to go eat. However, before they left the street of stone gambling, Gu Ning received Qiao Ya’s call. She didn’t realize that they were still in the store until now.

Qiao Ya told Gu Ning that some people had caused trouble in their store. Gu Ning was displeased and went straight back to her store.

Leng Shaoting followed Gu Ning, going back to her store. When he saw Gao Yi and Qiao Ya, he gave them a cold look, which made Gao Yi and Qiao Ya feel stressed.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya didn’t know Leng Shaoting, but they sensed that the man knew them and stared at them unkindly.

Gu Ning also noticed that, and she immediately interrupted them. “They both work for me.”

Leng Shaoting drew his look back, but remained silent.

“And he’s my boyfriend. Please don’t worry.” Gu Ning comforted them. Gao Yi and Qiao Ya felt a little relieved. Gao Yi and Qiao Ya didn’t regard Gu Ning as a young girl, so it wasn’t surprising that she had a boyfriend. Her boyfriend looked so powerful. From their rich experience of years, they were aware that the man was much stronger than them. However, no matter how strong or powerful he was, they only cared that he wasn’t threatening them.

Gu Ning’s sight fell on three men who were seated, trembling in fear in the corner. All of them were black and blue. Apparently, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya had already taught them a lesson.

“Boss, they claimed that the Wang Family sent them here,” Qiao Ya said seriously.

The Wang Family?

Without a doubt, it had to be Wang Hongming, because Gu Ning only had bitter conflict with him. She knew that Wang Hongming wouldn’t let it go easily, so she wasn’t surprised now, but Leng Shaoting was mad. He gave those men an icy glance, and those men instantly felt threatened.

Let alone those men, even Gu Ning along with Qiao Ya and Gao Yi thought that it was frightening.

Gu Ning pulled Leng Shaoting’s hand at once. “It’s fine.”

Leng Shaoting held Gu Ning’s hand in his palm and relaxed.

“Let them go! It’s no big deal, but if the Wang Family dares to do it again, we’ll fight back then,” Gu Ning said. It wasn’t because she was kind, but she thought that it wasn’t necessary to annoy the Wang Family just because of this small trouble.

Then she looked to those men and warned, “Tell the man behind you that if it happens again, we’ll fight back. Now get lost!”

Hearing that, the three men escaped away without delay.

“Gao Yi, Qiao Ya, please stay here for a while longer. I need to find a suitable factory right now, and I’ll rent it once I find it. Then we can move all the stuff there, in case the Wang Family tries to cause us more trouble,” Gu Ning ordered.

Although she wasn’t afraid of the Wang Family, she didn’t like trouble either. Thus she had to settle the factory as soon as possible.

“No problem!” Gao Yi and Qiao Ya replied.

Then Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting left for the factory that Zheng Peng had mentioned.

It wasn’t early now, but it wasn’t late neither.

On their way, Gu Ning finally had time to call Situ Ye.

Leng Shaoting felt slightly uncomfortable, but he understood that it was better to let Situ Ye handle the mess caused by members of the Qing Gang.

Situ Ye answered Gu Ning’s call and said, “Hi, what’s up?”

“Well, actually something terrible just happened, and I do hope that you can help me.” It was a little embarrassing for Gu Ning to bother Situ Ye.

“What happened?” Situ Ye asked.

“The thing is...” Gu Ning briefly told Situ Ye what had happened in Zheng Peng’s store and that Zheng Peng now worked for her. “Would you please help me talk to the senior management of the Qing Gang and stop causing Zheng Peng trouble in City Teng? He is indeed innocent,” Gu Ning said revealing the fact that she already knew that Situ Ye was the head of the Qing Gang.

Although Situ Ye normally didn’t bother himself with such trifles, he was annoyed when Gu Ning was involved.

“Sure, I’ll handle it,” Situ Ye answered with alacrity.

Gu Ning thanked him before she hung up.

“How did you meet those two?” Leng Shaoting asked Gu Ning this time and sounded serious.

The two were of course Gao Yi and Qiao Ya.
