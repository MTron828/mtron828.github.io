Chapter 1926: Stop Useless Struggling

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Hearing Gu Ning’s words, Fu Yihao felt relieved.

Qin Qianhui, on the contrary, was in a complete panic once she heard Gu Ning say that Fu Yanming would be here right away. “Give my son back to me!” she shouted at Gu Ning again.

“Ms. Qin, we can have a talk when Manager Fu is here,” said Gu Ning, coldly looking at Qin Qianhui.

“You...” Qin Qianhui was angry. If Fu Yihao wasn’t in her hands, she wouldn’t be able to threaten Fu Yanming into remarrying her after he came.

“Help! This woman wants to steal my child. Please help me!” Qin Qianhui suddenly shouted, and a few people who happened to be in the parking lot surrounded her right away. Qin Qianhui planned to take advantage of their kindness to get her child back.

.

Gu Ning did nothing, but stared at Qin Qianhui with mockery.

“What happened?” asked several men who walked over after hearing the shout.

Although they heard Qin Qianhui say that someone was robbing her of her child, they didn’t think Gu Ning was doing that! The boy was hiding behind Gu Ning after all. He wasn’t caught by Gu Ning.

“Please, this woman robbed me of my child. She’s very strong. My younger brother was just kicked by her,” said Qin Qianhui in anxiety, looking pitiful.

At this time, Qin Qianhai already got back to his feet, but the pain caused by the heavy kick in his abdomen made him unable to fully stand up, so he covered his abdomen with his hands.

Seeing that, everyone could imagine what had happened, and they began to look at Gu Ning unkindly.

Gu Ning sneered and said, “Everyone, this child is indeed hers, but she has divorced the child’s father and signed an agreement to sever her relationship with the child. Now she is trying to threaten her ex-husband into marrying her again by kidnapping his child...”

“Shut up, shut your mouth! It’s my family’s affair. You’re merely an outsider. It’s none of your business.” Qin Qianhui interrupted Gu Ning at once, because other people might not help her after knowing the truth. Unfortunately, she was too late, and the others already heard it.

Qin Qianhui’s reaction also proved the truth, so the men turned to look at her with disdain. They were displeased as well, because this woman just used their kindness!

This woman must be cold-blooded to divorce her husband and even sign an agreement to sever the relationship with her child.

Since she wanted to marry her ex-husband again, it meant that there was no problem with his ex-husband, but with her.

“You’ve already divorced Manager Fu and severed the mother-child relationship with Fu Yihao. The Fu family’s affairs aren’t your family affair anymore. By the way, Manager Fu is my subordinate. As his boss, I’m in a better position than you to deal with this matter,” Gu Ning said sarcastically.

Hearing that, the other people were greatly surprised. To their astonishment, she was a boss at such a young age.

Anyway, she indeed had an air which was totally different from ordinary people.

“You...” Qin Qianhui was mad. All of a sudden, she didn’t know what to say.

“Of course, I’m also an outsider, so let’s wait for Manager Fu to come to talk about it then! Don’t even try to run away, because you’ve already committed the crime of kidnapping,” said Gu Ning.

Qin Qianhui panicked a little when she heard that. She retorted, “I just took my son away. How come it’s illegal?”

“It is. Because you’ve severed your relationship with Fu Yihao, there is no relationship between you two now. Therefore, you taking him away without permission is an abduction,” said Gu Ning.

“You...” Qin Qianhui didn’t care about it until Gu Ning said that. Suddenly she didn’t know what to do.

An idea dawned on Qin Qianhui, and she immediately ran towards the entrance of the elevator.

Seeing that, Qin Qianhai ran behind her without hesitation.

Gu Ning hurried over and caught Qin Qianhui and Qin Qianhai in a few seconds, which amazed the men. She was really as strong as Qin Qianhui said.

Staring at Gu Ning, Fu Yihao rounded his eyes in shock.

When Gu Ning kicked Qin Qianhai just now, he was behind Gu Ning, so he didn’t see it. He didn’t witness Gu Ning’s fighting skills till now.

Most boys had a dream to become a hero. When Fu Yihao saw such a skilled and strong girl, he naturally admired her.

No one knew whether Fu Yihao was stunned by Gu Ning’s fighting skills or felt totally heart-broken by Qin Qianhui, but he didn’t seem emotional at all when his mother was caught by Gu Ning.

“Yihao, tell this woman to let me go, now!” Qin Qianhui shouted to Fu Yihao at once as if Gu Ning would let her go once Fu Yihao opened his mouth.

It wouldn’t happen, because Gu Ning wouldn’t let her go unless Fu Yanming came.

Watching Qin Qianhui, Fu Yihao had mixed emotions. He had sympathy for her, but didn’t think that they should let his mother go. After all, his mother just tried to use him to threaten his father. Most importantly, Fu Yihao didn’t have a close relationship with Qin Qianhui, because normally they lived with their grandparents. Qin Qianhui, instead, spent most of her time hanging out and shopping with her friends.

Seeing Fu Yihao standing just there, Qin Qianhui got angrier. “Yihao, do you want to help this woman to hurt mom?”

After being yelled at by Qin Qianhui, Fu Yihao didn’t know what to do.

“Ms. Qin, stop struggling. It’s useless. Manager Fu and the police will be here in a while,” sneered Gu Ning.

“You...” Qin Qianhui was full of anger, but could do nothing about it, because she couldn’t get rid of Gu Ning.

However, Qin Qianhui was reluctant to give in.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Right at this moment, they heard sirens wailing. Qin Qianhui’s and Qin Qianhai’s faces turned pale in an instant.

“Qianhui, I told you not to do that, but you wouldn’t listen to me. Now we’re doomed! The police really came. I’m afraid we’ll be put in jail.” Qin Qianhai blamed Qin Qianhui in fear. Even if Qin Qianhui did it in order to help him pay off his debts, he had tried to persuade her not to do that, but she wouldn’t listen to him. Now they were in big trouble, so he blamed her for it.

“You have no right to blame me for it. I did it for you!” Qin Qianhui became unreasonable because of Qin Qianhai, so it filled her with anger when Qin Qianhai turned to blame her.

It wasn’t entirely Qin Qianhai’s fault, because she also wanted to marry Fu Yanming again to live a rich life. After all, even though Fu Yanming wasn’t a boss now, he was the general manager of a large company, so he still made a lot of money.

Before long, several police cars came and stopped before them, and several policemen got out and walked over. After taking Qin Qianhui and Qin Qianhai from Gu Ning’s hands, they thanked her.

“Thank you, Miss Gu.” A policeman recognized Gu Ning and felt excited.
