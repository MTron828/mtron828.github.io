Chapter 2241: You Know It Too?

Zhan Zhiyin was aware of the Leng family’s family affairs, so she knew Jing Yunyao was Leng Shaoting’s mother and she was also surprised. However, because she found out that Jing Yunyao was a cultivator now, she understood how she was able to come back after disappearing for so many years.

It was hard for a cultivator to die, unless she ran into a strong enemy.

“It’s a long story. Why don’t we go inside first? It’s cold out here,” said Master Leng. He had no intention of avoiding this topic, but it was very cold outside, so they should go in the house.

After that, they went into the house together.

Zhan Zhiyin was scared of Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao, so she kept a distance away from them in case they hurt her.

Since they met, she knew it was impossible for her to leave here without issue and she tried to figure out a way to deal with this problem.

Jing Yunyao and Leng Shaoting stopped staring at her as if they had no idea about the fact that she actually was a monster. Before they were clear about her purpose, they couldn’t do anything. Even if they planned to do anything, they had to avoid the two old men.

They wondered whether Zhan Daosong knew his granddaughter was actually a monster!

In the living room, Master Leng told Zhan Daosong what Jing Yunyao had been through. He also said that Yunyao lost her memories in the accident, so she didn’t come home during the past years and everyone thought she was dead. They didn’t know who had died with Leng Yuanhan.

“Either way, it’s a good thing that Yunyao is fine and back home now,” Zhan Daosong sighed. He felt really sorry that Leng Yuanhan was really dead, but it was good news that Yunyao survived.

“Right!” Master Leng said. He never thought about which one of them should come back alive if only either Leng Yuanhan or Yunyao could survive.

Whoever could come back home alive, it was the result and he would accept it. He didn’t expect Leng Yuanhan instead of Jing Yunyao to come home just because Leng Yuanhan was his son.

Afterwards, they changed the topic.

Because it was still early for the meal, Gu Ning invited Zhan Zhiyin to have a walk outside. “Miss Zhan, why don’t we have a walk outside for a while?”

No matter what her purpose was, Gu Ning felt it was necessary for them to make it clear right now. She and Leng Shaoting would go to City Ao tomorrow, so they didn’t have much time.

“Sure!” Zhan Zhiyin agreed. Although she didn’t know why Gu Ning did that, she was unwilling to stay here any longer. It was too stressful.

Even if she didn’t know why Gu Ning invited her to have a walk outside, she didn’t think Gu Ning had found out the fact that she was a monster.

She couldn’t feel the air of cultivation from Gu Ning’s body, so she believed that Gu Ning wasn’t a cultivator. If Gu Ning wasn’t a cultivator, Gu Ning wouldn’t be able to know she was a monster. In addition, after she entered this house, Gu Ning didn’t talk with Leng Shaoting or Jing Yunyao alone, so she felt that Gu Ning should be unaware of it. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After that, Zhan Zhiyin walked out with Gu Ning.

It was December and the plum blossoms were in full bloom. There was a cluster of plum trees planted on the side of the yard, which looked pretty beautiful, so Gu Ning took Zhan Zhiyin over. Most importantly, no one was there, which was convenient for them to have a talk.

“I heard Grandpa Leng wants to set you up with Leng Shaoming. He hopes you can be a couple. Miss Zhan, what do you think about that?” Gu Ning didn’t want to point out that she was a monster right now.

“I don’t know. Since Grandpa Leng has that idea, we can have a meeting first,” said Zhan Zhiyin. She had a good impression of Leng Shaoming, but didn’t tell Gu Ning, because she had the manners of a girl.

“What if Leng Shaoming likes you, but you don’t like him? What will you do if Grandpa Leng and Grandpa Zhan want you to be together with him?” Gu Ning asked.

“Um, to be honest with you, I actually have a good impression of Shaoming, but we aren’t familiar although we know each other. Therefore, it’s hard to say I like him. If he also has a good impression of me, I’ll be willing to try. If he doesn’t like me, I won’t bother him,” said Zhan Zhiyin. In fact, she wasn’t worried about whether Leng Shaoming would like her. She was a monster after all, and she knew how to charm a man.

She was only worried that Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao might stand in her way.

Although she had no intention of harming Leng Shaoming and the Leng family, she was a monster after all. Monsters weren’t allowed to be together with humans, but she still wanted to be together with Leng Shaoming, because…

Anyway, Gu Ning was a mortal, while Leng Shaoting was a cultivator, but they were together now. Therefore, Zhan Zhiyin thought that they shouldn’t stop her as long as she proved that she was harmless.

Gu Ning understood that Zhan Zhiyin liked Leng Shaoming and came here for him.

“What if it isn’t suitable for you to be together?” Gu Ning asked.

Hearing that, Zhan Zhiyin was struck dumb for a second and became alert. She hadn’t spent any time with Leng Shaoming yet, so why did Gu Ning ask her that question? Did Gu Ning know something? Or was there another reason?

No matter what, Zhan Zhiyin should be careful, so she asked, “Has Shaoming already found his love?”

“I don’t know, but I don’t think you two should be together. You and him are not from the same world after all,” said Gu Ning, staring straight at Zhan Zhiyin. Zhan Zhiyin felt scared and avoided meeting her eyes.

Gu Ning said that she and Leng Shaoming weren’t from the same world. Gu Ning knew! Gu Ning knew the secret too!

Even though Gu Ning might know the secret as well, Zhan Zhiyin still refused to admit it. “Miss Gu, I don’t understand what you are talking about.” She played dumb.

Gu Ning smiled and said, “Great, then I’ll won’t beat around the bush. Miss Zhan, actually Shaoting, Shaoting’s mother, and I all know what you really are. Do you think we’ll let you join the Leng family?”

“Do you know it too?” Zhan Zhiyin was greatly surprised. She knew Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao could see that she was actually a monster, but she didn’t expect Gu Ning to know too. After all, Gu Ning was a mortal!
