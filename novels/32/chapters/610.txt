Chapter 612 Future Sister-in-law

The person Gu Ning was going to bring to meet Song Manni at dinner was Ning Changkai. As the managers of her subsidiaries, it was necessary for them to get familiar with each other. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“No problem,” Song Manni said.

After that, Gu Ning took a taxi to the medicine factory. On the way, Gu Ning called Lu Xiao, and invited him to join he for dinner. Although Lu Xiao was assigned the job by Leng Shaoting, he worked for her now after all, so it was also necessary for them to meet one another.

Once Lu Xiao heard that Gu Ning was in the capital and even invited him to dine with her, he was excited, because he was always curious about her. He wondered what kind of girl Gu Ning could be to steal his boss’s heart, so he agreed with alacrity.

When Gu Ning arrived at the medicine factory, it was almost 4pm.

The medicines and skincare products were mostly done. What they needed to do now was to wait for the result of the drug test before the products were put on the market.

Yesterday morning, Gu Ning had told Ning Changkai to send some samples to the State Food and Drug Administration, and they would get the results one or two days later.

Gu Ning understood that someone wanted to stop Ning Changkai from running his business. In the beginning, Gu Ning wanted to use her network to help Ning Changkai, but she thought it would be better if they could find out who had schemed against him.

If they passed the test, it would be the best result. If not, Gu Ning would find out who the backstabber was.

Today was the second day after the test, and they would know the results by tomorrow at the latest.

Although they didn’t have the permission yet, Gu Ning knew that her medicines met the standards, so she told Ning Changkai to keep on producing skincare products first. She needed to provide them for Kamei Beauty Salon.

Ning Changkai trusted Gu Ning, so he followed her order.

When it was almost 5:30 pm, Gu Ning brought Ning Changkai to the Huangdeng Hotel and they took Ning Changkai’s car. The appointed time was 6 pm, so they couldn’t be late.

On the way, Gu Ning called Lu Xiao and told him the number of the private room. If he arrived earlier, he could wait for them in the private room.

Lu Xiao, of course, didn’t dare to let Gu Ning wait for him, so he arrived early, but he waited for her in the hall because he wanted to see her first. Knowing that Gu Ning was still on her way, Lu Xiao told her that he would be waiting for her in the hall.

There was a traffic jam on the road, so Gu Ning and Ning Changkai arrived at the hotel 40 minutes later. Lu Xiao arrived 10 minutes earlier than Gu Ning.

When Gu Ning arrived, she called Lu Xiao.

Once Lu Xiao’s phone rang, Gu Ning heard the sound, and her sight fell on a handsome man in the hall. Lu Xiao, at the same time, met Gu Ning’s eyes. Lu Xiao thought that his boss’s girlfriend must be a gorgeous beauty, so he wasn’t very stunned when he saw Gu Ning, but he still thought that his future sister-in-law was really beautiful.

Although they both saw each other, Gu Ning didn’t hang up right away in order to make sure of it, and Lu Xiao answered her call too. When they were sure that they found the right person, they ended the call. Lu Xiao walked to Gu Ning at once. “Nice to meet you, future sister-in-law!”

Gu Ning was surprised that Lu Xiao would address her in that way, but she felt happy to hear it. However, it wasn’t suitable in front of others, so Gu Ning said, “Please call me Miss Gu when we are in a public place, or call me boss like others do.”

“Yes, boss,” Lu Xiao said.

“Let me introduce you. This is the general manager of the medical company under the name of my corporation, Ning Changkai,” Gu Ning said. “And this is the general manager of Fenghua Entertainment, Lu Xiao.”

They greeted each other politely, then walked upstairs.

“Boss, I’ve always been curious about what kind of girl you are and how you stole my boss’s heart. I’ve never seen him being so attracted to a woman. When I saw you today, I understand why. You’re so young and beautiful, and I bet no man can resist your charm!” Lu Xiao was good at socializing. Most importantly, he wanted to maintain a good relationship with his future sister-in-law.

“Oh,” Gu Ning said. “Do you mean your boss fell in love with me just because I’m young and beautiful?”

Hearing that, Lu Xiao explained at once. “Of course not! My boss will never judge a person from appearance. I think he must be attracted to you because of your outstanding ability.”

Gu Ning smiled, but didn’t say a word. She was actually just joking.

When they walked into the private room, K, Chen Cangyi, Song Manni and Zhang Shunjie were already there. Seeing Gu Ning, they all stood up to show their respect towards her.

Afterwards, Gu Ning introduced them to one another.

When Ning Changkai got to know the others around the table, he realized that Gu Ning was building a business empire. He was shocked, but also believed in Gu Ning more.

Everyone there was a key manager of Gu Ning’s corporation. Of course, there were other key managers who were absent today.

Right at this moment, Gu Ning thought of Chen Darong, but it was too late to call him to join them now, so Gu Ning gave up on the idea. She decided to visit Xiangyun Antique-store tomorrow.

Gu Ning didn’t forget that there was a box of antiques at the bottom of the lake in the park. She planned to salvage it in the dark.

During the meal, everyone enjoyed it, and they didn’t compete against each other for Gu Ning’s attention. Of course, Gu Ning didn’t know whether they would change in the future, but they all owed Gu Ning. As long as they remained grateful, they wouldn’t argue or fight against one another for personal benefits and ruin Gu Ning’s business. In addition, they worked in different industries.
