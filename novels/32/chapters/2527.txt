Chapter 2529: Don’t Blame Me for That

Wei Lingfeng told Leng Shaoting that he wanted to invite Gu Ning to share a meal at his home.

It wasn’t a courtesy, he really just wanted to meet Gu Ning, who was such a talented girl.

Leng Shaoting nodded.

After he left the Wei family’s house, he directly went to the Shengning Organization.

Once Leng Shaoting arrived, Gu Ning asked him, “How is it?”

“The president agreed,” said Leng Shaoting.

“Wonderful!” Gu Ning was excited, but Leng Shaoting put on a resigned look.

After that, he took out a certificate and handed it to Gu Ning. “This is your certificate. From now on, you’re an extra teammate of the Red Flame. It contains signatures and seals from me and the president. If anyone dares to question your qualifications in the future, you can show this to them.”

Gu Ning was an extra teammate, not a formal one.

There were rules in the Red Flame and they couldn’t appoint a new member or fire a member randomly. Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao were able to be their extra members simply because they had superpowers.

In addition, they were Leng Shaoting’s fiancée and mother, so it was best that Leng Shaoting managed them. After all, not all of the members of their team were aware that monsters and ghosts really existed.

“The Red Flame? Shouldn’t it be the Burning Flame?” Gu Ning asked in confusion. Because she had visited Leng Shaoting’s military base before, she knew that it was called the Burning Flame.

Since Gu Ning had already joined the Red Flame, Leng Shaoting felt it was necessary for her to know more about them. Moreover, he had complete trust in her. Therefore, Leng Shaoting explained. “The Burning Flame is a special army, and I am its head. Xu Jinchen and my other bros are deputy leaders of the Burning Flame. Each of us leads a corps, but normally there are other leaders training the soldiers. Twelve of us, including me, Xu Jinchen, Ai Weichen, Chen Meng, Xin Bei, and Si Ming, make up a special team called the Red Flame. The Red Flame doesn’t listen to any of the military forces. We have the power to work independently. As for the excellent soldiers in the Burning Flame, they are substitutes for the Red Flame.”

“However, the Red Flame never goes public, so only senior officials in the government and senior officers in the military are aware of it. That’s also the reason why I didn’t tell you any details. Please don’t blame me,” said Leng Shaoting. Although he knew that Gu Ning was very considerate, he cared about her feelings.

“Of course I won’t! I know it’s highly confidential. I never asked you about the tasks you carried out either,” said Gu Ning. She obviously wouldn’t blame Leng Shaoting for that.

Gu Ning understood that some special people couldn’t make their real identities public. They even kept it a secret from their families.

They needed to protect themselves. Besides, they also needed to disguise themselves as other people when they carried out tasks.

If they successfully finished their tasks, it would be best. If not, their enemies might get revenge on their families if their real identities were exposed.

Although Leng Shaoting was aware that Gu Ning wouldn’t blame him, he still couldn’t feel calm until he heard her answer.

After that, it was time for lunch, so they went out to eat.

They didn’t eat at the dining hall of Gu Ning’s company, not because the food provided by the Shengning Organization wasn’t delicious, but because they were constantly the focus of people’s attention, which made them feel uneasy. Most importantly, they preferred to have some private time.

After the meal, Leng Shaoting drove Gu Ning back to her company, then left. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

In the afternoon, Lu Zhan came. Knowing that Gu Ning was in the company, he went to see her. However, it was nothing important, he simply went to chat with her.

He told Gu Ning that Life After Life, Legend of Demon Flower would start shooting tomorrow. And said that if she had time, she could attend the ceremony.

Gu Ning didn’t agree right away, because she needed to see whether she was free tomorrow, but if she had time, she would go to the ceremony.

Lu Zhan didn’t force her. He only told her that the shooting would begin at Qianling Mountain.

Because Life After Life, Legend of Demon Flower was a fantasy drama, they shot in mountains most of the time and Qianling Mountain was a great choice.

It was cold recently, so there weren’t many visitors at Qianling Mountain.

Because the altitude of Qianling Mountain was a little high, it was much colder at the top than at the bottom so fewer people climbed up to the top.

Upon hearing that they would shoot at Qianling Mountain, Gu Ning wanted to have a look, but she needed to wait till tomorrow.

That afternoon, Chu Peihan called Gu Ning and also told her that the shooting of Life After Life, Legend of Demon Flower would begin tomorrow. Chu Peihan asked her whether she would go.

As a supporting actress, Chu Peihan would be present at the launching ceremony.

However, Gu Ning didn’t give Chu Peihan an affirmative answer either, because she couldn’t be sure until tomorrow.

…

Shi Xiaoyue went to school at 2 pm, but didn’t have the courage to meet Chu Peihan. Because Chu Peihan hadn’t replied to her message yet, she didn’t know how Chu Peihan felt right now.

At 3 pm, Shi Xiaoyue couldn’t wait any longer and sent Chu Peihan another message.

Shi Xiaoyue: Peihan, are you still mad at me? I’m sorry, can you forgive me?

Reading Shi Xiaoyue’s new message, Chu Peihan suddenly remembered that she hadn’t replied to Shi Xiaoyue yet.

Was she still mad at Shi Xiaoyue? In fact, her anger towards Shi Xiaoyue already went away after she returned to their dormitory yesterday.

Without delay, Chu Peihan replied to Shi Xiaoyue:?Of course not.

Shi Xiaoyue was cheered up when she read Chu Peihan’s reply.

Shi Xiaoyue: Can I go to see you?

Chu Peihan: Sure, but don’t talk about Han Chenglin, or I’ll chase you out.

Shi Xiaoyue: No problem, I won’t mention his name at all.

After that, Shi Xiaoyue went to see Chu Peihan, and they didn’t speak about Han Chenglin at all.

Although they had an argument last night, they were still good friends.

…

At 5 pm, Gu Ning left her company and headed to the siheyuan.

When she was alone, she preferred to go to the siheyuan, because there were more people in the siheyuan and she loved the company.

…

In the cultivation world, Jing Jining could only cultivate all day long. However, he had patience and had no intention of running out. Even if he dared, Jing Yaorong would know, since Jing Yaorong’s people were still watching him.

Anyway, every time before he came back to the cultivation world, he settled everything in his business, so it wouldn’t be a problem even if he was absent for a long while.
