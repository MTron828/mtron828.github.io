Chapter 2643: Extremely Ruthless

“Even though I don’t have evidence, do you think you can get away with it?” Jing Yunyao mocked. “Without this voice recording, you’re still the murderer who killed my husband. I need to take revenge, and I don’t need anyone’s permission. I played this voice recording simply to see how you would explain it.”

Jing Yaorong suddenly didn’t know what to say.

“Actually, I didn’t have the intention to kill anyone before today, but now I think you have to die,” said Jing Yunyao. Her voice was very cold and it seemed as if she couldn’t wait to kill them.

Hearing that, Jing Yaorong guessed that Senior Mrs. Jing must have found the evil cultivator to kill Jing Yunyao and Leng Shaoting.

“Yunyao, what happened?” Jing Jining asked Jing Yunyao with a serious expression, because he knew that they must have done something unacceptable to Jing Yunyao or Leng Shaoting, for Jing Yunyao to be so mad. “”

Before Jing Yunyao opened her mouth, several elders rushed over. When they saw Jing Yunyao, they were shocked.

They didn’t know that Jing Yunyao was still alive. In fact, only Jing Yaorong’s family, Jing Yanhua’s family, and the housekeeper were aware of that.

Normally, the elders needed to deal with their own business, and rarely stayed in the front yard of the Jing family’s house. They only showed up when there was something important.

Unexpectedly, Jing Yunyao wasn’t dead, and she was familiar with Shangguan Yang.

They knew that Jing Yunyao’s death had something to do with Jing Yaorong, so she came back this time to take revenge.

Among the three elders in the Jing family, other than Jing Huaiyang, both the eldest and youngest elder were in the primary stage of the Yuan Ying Period, but they couldn’t see Jing Yunyao’s exact level, which meant Jing Yunyao was at a higher level than them.

Because of that, they had the same guess as Jing Yaorong and thought that Jing Yunyao must be at the peak of the Yuan Ying Period or an even higher level.

Whether she was at the peak of the Yuan Ying Period or an even higher level, she was a very rare master. It was so shocking that they could hardly believe it.

......

In that case, Jing Yaorong was doomed to fail.

Jing Yunyao was also not the only master. She had Shangguan Yang’s help, and a young man and woman were standing behind Shangguan Yang. The young man was also in the Yuan Ying Period!

The eldest elder wasn’t dumb, so he gave up the intention of helping Jing Yaorong because he could see the result now. There was no need for him to take the risk.

The second elder had the same opinions as the eldest elder. He had no intention of getting involved in this mess.

On the other hand, the youngest elder was loyal to Jing Yaorong. Although he was aware that the situation was very dangerous and he was scared too, he decided to support Jing Yaorong.

“Hi, elders, I bet you must know why I came back. There is no grudge between me and you, so I don’t want to make it difficult for you. However, if you want to help Jing Yaorong, I’ll have no mercy for you. It’s totally up to you now,” said Jing Yunyao.

Hearing that, Jing Yaorong was upset. He turned to look at the three elders, waiting for their answers.

Although he already knew the answers, he still wanted to hear how they would reply.

The youngest elder who was loyal to him spoke first. “As the Jing family’s elder, I must support the Jing family’s patriarch.”

“Right, but since it’s the patriarch’s personal affair. I think we should leave it to him. I don’t think I will get involved,” said the eldest elder.

It wasn’t a surprising answer, but Jing Yaorong was still very angry. However, before he said anything, the youngest elder lost his temper. “What do you mean? Jing Yunyao was already chased out of the Jing family. She’s no longer a member of the Jing family. It’s your duty to protect and defend the Jing family and the patriarch.”

“No matter what, it’s the patriarch’s personal grudge. Who caused the situation today? And if the patriarch really has killed Jing Yunyao’s husband, he broke a rule in the cultivation world. If we get involved now, we’ll be punished by Tiandaozong as well. If you want to do that, do it alone. I won’t get involved.” The eldest elder argued.

“You…” Hearing that, the youngest elder didn’t know what to say, because the eldest elder was right. However, he still didn’t want to give up.

“Second elder, how about you?” The youngest elder asked Jing Huaiyang.

“I agree with the eldest elder, so I won’t be involved either,” said Jing Huaiyang. At the beginning, he hesitated to make a decision, but he made up his mind to do the same thing as the eldest elder.

“You…” The youngest elder was furious. He wanted to criticize them, but didn’t know what to say. Since they were unwilling to do anything, it was useless no matter what he said.

“I think I’ve treated you very well. How could you be so cold-blooded?” Jing Yaorong got mad too. Even though he might not be able to win with their help, he felt that their refusal to help him was cold-blooded.

“Cold-blooded?” Jing Yunyao sneered at this time. “Patriarch, do you think you’re not cold-blooded? Perhaps you’re nice to some people, but you were extremely ruthless to me and my mother.”

“Your mother deserved it,” said Jing Yaorong. He was forced to marry Jing Yunyao’s mother. Why should he treat her well?

“She deserved it? Right. But it should be my maternal grandfather’s fault. He shouldn’t have saved your father. Then your father wouldn’t have forced you to marry her. Yet you returned kindness with ingratitude!” Jing Yunyao said mockingly. Even though she didn’t know the real reason behind her mother’s death, she believed that her mother didn’t die from a disease.

Therefore, she believed that it had to have something to do with Senior Mrs. Jing or Jing Yaorong. After all, both of them wanted her mother dead.

However, she knew if she asked them about it now, they wouldn’t tell her the truth. Anyway, she was determined to take revenge.

Hearing Jing Yunyao’s words, Jing Yaorong was furious. Even Jing Yanhua was embarrassed too. After all, it was indeed their fault. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Alright, I don’t want to waste time on that. Since the eldest elder and second elder have made their decision. Let’s deal with the problem now!” said Jing Yunyao.
