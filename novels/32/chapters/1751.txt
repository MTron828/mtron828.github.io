Chapter 1752: It Will Be Embarrassing

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

As for how people guessed Gu Ning’s relationship with Leng Shaoting, some thought that they were a couple, while some believed that they were brother and sister.

Gu Ning, Leng Shaoting, and Jing Yunyao didn’t care about the discussions as long as they weren’t unkind, and they kept on choosing food.

They didn’t buy much meat, instead buying many vegetables.

After grocery shopping, Leng Shaoting carried the shopping bags. Although they bought a lot, Leng Shaoting was very strong so it was easy for him.

They started to cook once they were home. Both Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to help Jing Yunyao wash the food, but didn’t interfere in cooking. After all, Leng Shaoting wanted to eat dishes cooked by Jing Yunyao. If they helped her with it, the taste would be different.

Therefore, when Jing Yunyao was busy cooking, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to the study. Gu Ning took out the guns, drugs, and explosives, then Leng Shaoting put them into his Qiankun Bag.

“It seems that the Tianying Gang is quite influential. It can get so many illegal things,” said Leng Shaoting. It wasn’t surprising that an illegal gang could get them, but it wasn’t easy to get a lot of them.

“There are many gold bars too! I can’t take them out randomly, so I need to exchange them for money in the future,” said Gu Ning.

“Can I help?” asked Leng Shaoting.

“No need, I can handle it,” said Gu Ning.

“Do you plan to turn to Situ Ye for help?” Leng Shaoting was displeased all of a sudden.

Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second, not because Leng Shaoting was right, but because she almost forgot Situ Ye if Leng Shaoting didn’t bring up his name. They hadn’t contacted each other for a long time after all.

“I totally forgot him until you brought his name up. I’m not going to see him, but the Tianying Gang. It’s an illegal gang and it works for me now. It should be easy.” Gu Ning knew that Leng Shaoting was a jealous lover, so she explained at once.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting felt much better, then he hugged Gu Ning and kissed her without delay.

He hadn’t tasted her for a long time, and he badly missed it.

In a few minutes, Gu Ning pushed Leng Shaoting away. “Alright, it’ll be embarrassing if my lips are swollen.”

Even though she felt reluctant to push Leng Shaoting away because they hadn’t been so close for a long time, it wasn’t a suitable time right now.

Leng Shaoting was a little dissatisfied when Gu Ning pushed him away, because he hadn’t had enough of the kiss, but Gu Ning was right. In order to not embarrass Gu Ning, he didn’t continue, but he stared at her as if he wanted to swallow her.

Honestly, he hadn’t had sex with Gu Ning in a long time, and was horny now.

Gu Ning was amused, but she pulled Leng Shaoting outside in case he lost control of himself. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Leng Shaoting understood why she did that and was amused too. It seemed that she really took him as a horny man. Although he really wanted to have sex with her, he was still conscious about the place!

After Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went back to the living room, they sat together to watch TV.

About half an hour later, all the dishes were ready and they began to have lunch.

Leng Shaoting had mixed emotions once he had the familiar dishes. He used to have a family of three, but now...

Even though Leng Shaoting had mixed emotions, he didn’t show anything on his face. It wasn’t sensible to live in memories, and he should be happy that he met his mother now. He should think more about his future, about how to improve his cultivation and take revenge. Gu Ning also needed to figure out a way to become a cultivator.

Thinking of that, Leng Shaoting felt sad again. His master had told him it was very dangerous, and he didn’t want Gu Ning to risk her life.

In fact, although he didn’t tell Gu Ning that he had asked Shangguan Yang about the possibility of a mortal becoming a cultivator, he knew that Gu Ning must have done the same thing and have the same answer.

Gu Ning didn’t say anything about it, or show anything on her face, but he knew she ached to become a cultivator. Because she didn’t want him to lose his cultivation which he had tried hard to get and the great chance to live a long healthy life, she had to do her best to follow him.

Gu Ning didn’t say or show anything in order to not worry him. However, it was impossible for him not to be worried. As a result, Leng Shaoting decided to have a talk with Shangguan Yang. If Gu Ning really wanted to cut her bones and purify her marrow, he had to be told.

To be honest, Leng Shaoting didn’t know whether he would support that idea or not. He shouldn’t agree if he worried about her, because he already made the decision to die with her if she had to die after aging one day.

It sounded selfish for Jing Yunyao, because she would have to watch her son die. Nevertheless, Leng Shaoting didn’t think he could live a meaningful life without Gu Ning.

Actually, if Gu Ning insisted on cutting her bones and purifying her marrow, he couldn’t stop her from doing it. He knew her character very well.

When Leng Shaoting thought about that, he showed his worries, which attracted attention from Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao.

Gu Ning didn’t ask him, but Jing Yunyao did at once. “What’s wrong? Don’t you like the dishes?”

“Of course I do,” said Leng Shaoting. “I just thought of something else. It’s not a big deal. I love these dishes. They’re delicious.”

Hearing that, Jing Yunyao didn’t ask further about what he was thinking just then. He wasn’t a kid any longer, and could make decisions on his own.

“Great, if you love them, I can cook more often for you,” said Jing Yunyao. Nothing could satisfy her more than that her son loved dishes cooked by her.

As long as the children were happy, parents would be satisfied.

“Wonderful,” Leng Shaoting said.

Jing Yunyao was really a good cook, so they ate more than usual this time.

After having lunch, Leng Shaoting did the dishes as always. Although Jing Yunyao didn’t think there was anything wrong with that, Gu Ning felt a little embarrassed. However, she could do nothing about it, because Leng Shaoting didn’t need her help, and Jing Yunyao pulled her out.

Because Gu Ning had something else to deal with, she left at 1 pm. Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao didn’t stop her. Leng Shaoting also went back to their military base at 3 pm.

Although he came back with Xu Jinchen this time, he had stayed in the capital for longer because of his own business. Xu Jinchen left earlier, so Leng Shaoting went back alone.
