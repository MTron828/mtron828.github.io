Chapter 520 Won’t You Feel Lonely If You Sleep Alone?

Gu Ning could feel his strong grievance through the phone and she was amused, but she immediately thought of a good idea. “Why don’t you go to City G? If you don’t mind, you can be our private chauffeur in the following two days. Wherever we go, you can drive us there.”

“No problem,” Leng Shaoting agreed with alacrity. He, of course, wouldn’t mind being their chauffeur. Although Gu Ning’s mother and aunt would be there too and he couldn’t kiss or touch her as he wanted, he could still stay near her. However, Leng Shaoting wasn’t satisfied, so he asked with anticipation, “Where will you be staying at night?”

It was a normal question, but Gu Ning understood Leng Shaoting’s real intention. Her heart beat fast and her cheeks flushed. “Um, my mother and my aunt can stay in my apartment and I can stay in a hotel.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was excited. “Very well. Then I’ll stay in the hotel with you.”

Hearing that, a picture of them having sex at night appeared in Gu Ning’s mind, and her heart beat faster, but she pretended to be calm. “I didn’t say that I’m going to sleep with you!”

“Baby, you know you want to.” He laughed and flirted with her, which made Gu Ning’s heart skip a beat. He was so sexy and charming that even his voice could easily turn her on.

Leng Shaoting was just used to being cold. If he smiled more, far more women would be attracted to him. Nonetheless, Gu Ning didn’t want it to happen so she would rather see Leng Shaoting being cold to everyone except her than see him smiling all day.

“If you don’t sleep with me, then who will you sleep with?” Leng Shaoting teased.

Gu Ning was surprised and took a long breath in. Since when has Leng Shaoting become so good at flirting? She thought to herself, but she had to admit that she kind of liked it.

“I’ll sleep alone,” Gu Ning said on purpose.

“Won’t you feel lonely if you sleep all alone for a long night?” Leng Shaoting smiled lightly but his voice was soaked with sexual desire.

Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second. If she hadn’t recognized Leng Shaoting’s voice, she would have taken him as another man.

“Shaoting?” She still called him with doubt.

“Yes, what’s wrong?” Leng Shaoting asked. He thought that Gu Ning had something serious to talk to him about, so his voice went back to normal.

“Nothing. I just feel like you’ve changed a lot,” Gu Ning said.

Leng Shaoting was struck dumb for a second now, because he didn’t notice any changes in himself. He just felt so comfortable and at ease when he got along with Gu Ning.

“My love for you will never change,” Leng Shaoting said gently.

Gu Ning felt touched and flushed a little.

Leng Shaoting understood that Gu Ning was shy, so he stopped flirting with her. Besides, he could directly express his love to her with actions tomorrow night.

“When will you leave for City G tomorrow?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“8 am,” Gu Ning said.

“Great, I’ll pick you up at the airport by then,” Leng Shaoting said.

“What?” Gu Ning was surprised. “It takes three hours of flying from the capital to City G! If you’re going to pick us up at the airport, you can’t have a good rest.”

Gu Ning didn’t want Leng Shaoting to be so tired because he had just finished his task.

“I want to meet you as soon as possible, and I can rest in the plane,” Leng Shaoting said. He couldn’t wait a second longer to meet Gu Ning.

“Alright!” Since Leng Shaoting said so, Gu Ning agreed because she also ached to see him.

The two hung up later after talking for a short while.

That night, Gu Man still couldn’t fall asleep, but she was able to stay cheerful after drinking the water Gu Ning poured for her the next day. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

It was the first time that Gu Man and Gu Qing had taken a plane, so both of them were quite nervous.

Gu Ning bought the plane tickets for the first class, so they could use the VIP lounge but Gu Man and Gu Qing were curious about the airport terminals, so they waited there instead.

It was still a dozen minutes away from the departure time, and they were sitting on the chairs outside of the gate.

“Man, are you nervous? I’m really nervous now!” Gu Qing asked Gu Man and her voice was trembling.

“Me too!” Gu Man said.

“Will the plane be stable if it flies so fast? And will it fall if it flies so high?” Gu Qing asked with anxiety.

“Gee, two bumpkins!” Hearing the talk between Gu Qing and Gu Man, a woman who sat nearby laughed at them.

Gu Qing and Gu Man felt a little embarrassed, while Gu Ning was slightly annoyed. Even if Gu Qing and Gu Man were bumpkins, Gu Ning wouldn’t tolerate it if anyone else dared make fun of them. However, she didn’t want to make a mountain out of a molehill just because of that, so she stayed quiet for now. If the woman dared to do it again, she wouldn’t be quiet anymore.

Since the woman laughed at them, Gu Qing and Gu Man shut their mouths at once. “Mom, aunt, it’s not a big deal, and it’s totally understandable that you’re nervous when you are flying for the first time,” Gu Ning said to comfort them.

Gu Qing and Gu Man gave her a smile to show that they didn’t mind.

Nevertheless, the woman opened her mouth again, “A bunch of bumpkins!”

“Shut up!” Gu Ning criticized her coldly, turning to stare at the woman. Her look was very sharp, and the woman felt frightened. Jesus! This young girl is so frightening! The woman thought to herself then turned her gaze away from Gu Ning.

“Ningning, it’s fine.” Seeing that Gu Ning was getting mad, Gu Man and Gu Qing comforted her in a hurry. They disliked the woman’s behavior too, but didn’t want to make a scene here.

Since the woman was scared of her, Gu Ning didn’t say another word.

When it was the departure time, everyone started to get aboard. The woman who had made fun of Gu Qing and Gu Man got on the plane along with them.
