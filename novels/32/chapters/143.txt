Chapter 144: Hao Ran’s Parents

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

However, others also disliked the man’s behavior. It was Master Qin’s birthday party. He shouldn’t cause An Guangyao trouble right now, and he would only leave a bad impression on the Qin Family.

The man was named Wu Lianqin, a president of a branch of a giant group in City F. He was the same age as An Guangyao.

This branch was involved in the real estate industry and had one billion yuan in assets. Wu Lianqing, as the president, owned 25% shares of this branch. His net wealth was two or three hundred million yuan at most.

Wu Lianqin was ambitious. He had planned to acquire Shenghua Real Estate as his own private property, but he hadn’t been willing to pay a reasonable price for it. Thus Gu Ning had seized the chance.

An Guangyao was annoyed, but he didn’t show it on his face. He replied, “Oh, I almost went bankrupt, but President Wu still congratulated me. That’s interesting!”

“Chairman An, please don’t be mad at me. I didn’t mean that at all. I congratulated you only because you kept your job as the chairman of Shenghua Real Estate,” Wu Lianqin explained. He of course wouldn’t admit it.

“Well, President Wu, I don’t think you need to explain it. You will only make it worse. You congratulated me because I kept my job as the chairman. However, I could keep my job only because I sold my company. Otherwise, I wouldn’t need to work as an employee, and the company would still belong to me,” An Guangyao said.

“You...” Wu Lianqin didn’t know what to say. He realized that he had been rude. He wanted to make fun of An Guangyao, but now he was a joke himself. “Chairman An, if you insist on saying that, I can’t do anything about it.”

Then Wu Lianqin walked away, like he was the victim.

An Guangyao let him go. It wasn’t appropriate to cause a scene at this party after all.

He turned and immediately noticed Gu Ning and her friends. An Guangyao was amazed by Gu Ning’s outfit. This girl could always surprise you.

An Guangyao walked towards them. An Yi greeted him at once. The others did the same thing without delay.

In public, An Guangyao had to keep his relationship with Gu Ning a secret, so he treated her the same way he treated the younger generation.

After a while, a couple stepped up to them, but before they came near, the woman opened her mouth. “Ha, there you are. I told you to come with us, but you refused. I thought you’re not interested in this party. Unexpectedly, you secretly came here with your friends.”

Gu Ning and the others didn’t know who they were, and they were puzzled. Right at that moment, Hao Ran replied with obvious dislike, “I didn’t want to come with you adults! I want to be with my friends.”

Hearing that, Gu Ning and the others immediately realized that this couple was Hao Ran’s parents.

“Don’t you want to see me? Honey, look at him. Our son dislikes us,” the woman complained like a child to the man beside her.

Um...

Gu Ning and others were struck dumb. Was this Hao Ran’s mother? She was so adorable!

However, both Hao Ran and his father, Hao Zhonglong rolled their eyes with one accord. Hao Ran said, “Mom, it’s a public place. Could you please behave normally?”

“What did you say?” Hao Ran’s mother suddenly changed her face, like she was irritated.

Gu Ning and others were once again surprised by Hao Ran’s mother’s quick reaction, but it was much easier to get along with such a delightful person.

“Chairman An, please don’t mind her.” Hao Zhonglong ignored Hao Ran and his wife, talking to An Guangyao instead.

“Chairman Hao, so nice to meet you! I don’t mind at all,” An Guangyao replied. He shook hands with Hao Zhonglong.

Hao Zhonglong ran a business in the hotel and catering industry with five hundred million yuan of wealth. His company was ranked just behind Shenghua Real Estate in City F according to the assets. The two families didn’t have any conflict in business, so they got along well.

In addition, An Guangyao and Hao Zhonglong now found out that their sons were close friends already. They naturally became friendlier to each other. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Nice to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Hao,” Gu Ning and others greeted them.

When Mrs. Hao noticed the three girls, her eyes lit up. “What three beautiful girls you are! Is there any of you who like my son? Are you willing to marry my son?”

Everyone didn’t know what to say all of a sudden.

“Mom...” Hao Ran failed to argue back.

“Alright, let’s stop bothering those kids, and go over there to greet other people!” Hao Zhonglong pulled his wife away at once, in case she would continue to surprise those children.

“Oh, wait...” Mrs. Hao apparently wanted to say something more, but she was pulled away by her husband.

“Um, my mom behaves like a child sometimes. Please don’t mind her,” Hao Ran explained.

“It’s fine. I think you mother is adorable,” Gu Ning said.

“Well, I need to socialize with my friends too. You all have fun,” An Guangyao said then he walked away.

Although An Guangyao wasn’t the owner of the Shenghua Real Estate now, he was still the chairman with absolute executive right. And his business partners were willing to maintain a good relationship with him as usual.

After that, Gu Ning and her friends went back to eat and drink.

“Mu Ke, I haven’t seen you parents yet,” Hao Ran asked. It was almost 8 pm, but Hao Ran’s parents were absent.

“Oh, my father is on a business trip. He isn’t available, so he let his secretary come here on behalf of him,” Mu Ke said.

When there were only a few minutes away from 8 pm, Qin Yifan’s father, Qin Haozheng arrived.

Qin Haozheng was in a black Chinese tunic suit. He was sixty, but still strong and tough.

There was a woman in her early fifties to the right of Qin Haozheng. She was in a dark red cheongsam. The color of her clothes matched his. This woman was Qin Haozheng’s wife, Qin Yifan’s mother.

To the left of Qin Haozheng stood a woman in her late thirties. She was in a rose red cheongsam. The woman was Qin Yifan’s elder sister, Qin Yiqing.

Qin Haozheng and his wife had their only son, Qin Yifan, at a very old age. Thus they had spoiled him ever since he had been a baby, but they were also strict parents when it came to education. Therefore, Qin Yifan hadn’t been spoiled rotten, but had grown up to be an outstanding man.

Now, Qin Yifan was gradually taking over his family business.

The minute that Qin Haozheng appeared, the crowd became quiet. Everyone focused on him.

After a short speech, it was the time of sending gifts.

The first group naturally was the people from the Qin Family. Qin Haozheng’s younger brother, Qin Zixun’s father, Qin Haozhi was the first one.

Qin Haozhi was the general secretary in the committee of City F.

Gu Ning didn’t know Qin Zixun’s father was a powerful official until now.
