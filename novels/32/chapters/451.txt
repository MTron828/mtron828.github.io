Chapter 453 I’ll Live Wherever You Live

At the left side of the yard, there was an artificial rockery with a beautiful lotus pond under it. It was winter, so there were no lotus blossoms but a school of carp was swimming around in it. Beside the lotus pond, there was a small gazebo with a rock table and four rock stools in it. When the weather turned warmer, they could relax and unwind here. On both sides of the yard, there were passages in a historical style.

Gu Ning immediately fell in love with the style.

This was just the front yard, and there was also a backyard. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

They kept moving ahead, walking through the front hall to the back yard. Gu Ning’s eyes lit up again when she saw the view. The back yard was so exquisite that Gu Ning was really in love with this place.

“Do you like it?” Although Leng Shaoting already knew the answer from Gu Ning’s face, he still wanted to hear the answer from her mouth.

“Of course I do!” Gu Ning smiled with happiness.

Leng Shaoting hugged Gu Ning and said. “This place is near the Capital University. When you study we can live here.”

Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second and rejected. “No, I’m going to buy my own house.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was upset. “No, you’re going to live here with me.”

“No.”

“I don’t care. I’ll live wherever you live.” Leng Shaoting didn’t want to argue with Gu Ning. All he wanted was to live with her. Gu Ning was amused by his childlike response, but she would make the decision when it came.

Although Leng Shaoting never stayed in this siheyuan everything that was needed was in it, and it was cleaned regularly, so they could stay here whenever they wanted.

“Ningning, do you want to rest in the room, or go grocery shopping with me?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“I’ll go with you,” Gu Ning said without hesitation.

“Great.” Leng Shaoting then held Gu Ning’s hand and drove to the supermarket. When they entered the supermarket, people around them were all stunned by their outstanding appearance. Some women even stared at Leng Shaoting and directly ignored their own male partners. However, Leng Shaoting didn’t pay any attention to them, but instead asked Gu Ning, “What do you want to have?”

“Let’s have a look around first!” Gu Ning said. She actually had no idea what food to buy, because she wasn’t very interested in cooking.

Leng Shaoting pushed the cart while Gu Ning was looking for what she wanted. Gu Ning didn’t choose a lot of food, because there were only two of them.

After grocery shopping, Leng Shaoting told Gu Ning to rest and that he would cook.

At this time, Gu Ning received Gu Man’s call.

“Ningning! The Lantern Festival is three days away. When are you coming home?” Gu Man asked. Her daughter was busy every day in another city. She was worried, but could do nothing about it.

“I’m busy tomorrow, but I’ll be back the day after tomorrow,” Gu Ning said.

“You’re always busy, but I can’t help you with that. You must take good care of yourself. I don’t care how much money you can make, your health matters the most, alright?” Gu Man said.

“I understand. Mom, you also need to take good care of yourself,” Gu Ning said. “Oh, did the people from the Gu Family cause you trouble these past days?”

Hearing that, Gu Man was quiet for a few seconds before she said, “Gu Qinxiang called me once. His company can barely stay afloat now, so he wanted to borrow some money, but I rejected him.”

Although Gu Qinxiang was Gu Man’s older brother, what he had done had completely broken her heart, so she would never forget the past and help him. Gu Man lived an affluent life now, so they wanted to ride on their coattails. If Gu Man was as poor as in the past, they would never remember that Gu Man was their family.

From what Gu Man knew about Gu Qinxiang, she understood that they wouldn’t respect her even though she was rich now. Instead, they would do their best to grab her wealth away or destroy her life.

“Well done! Just ignore them.” Gu Ning supported Gu Man. After chatting with Gu Man for a few minutes, Gu Ning hung up the phone.

Within an hour and a half, five dishes were placed on the table. Leng Shaoting then called Gu Ning to dine together.

Cao Wenxin and Ai Xinyu had an appointment today. And Ai Xinyu came with another female friend, Su Tongnuo.

Su Tongnuo was very pretty and elegant. She wasn’t a famous actress, but her acting skills were quite good. However, she didn’t get many chances because she refused to accept the unspoken rules in the entertainment industry. And ever since she had annoyed a big boss, she had been directly shut out of the industry.

Su Tongnuo’s major was graphic design in her college, and she had entered the entertainment industry by coincidence. Since the company she worked for was unwilling to give her any chances now, she relied on Ai Xinyu who helped her get some jobs concerning graphic design to make a living.

Ai Xinyu’s family was relatively rich with a good amount of wealth, but didn’t have any power, so her parents weren’t able to help her get rid of the company.

When the three of them had just walked into a restaurant, they noticed a robber. Without delay, Cao Wenxin ran to catch him. Although the robber ran fast, Cao Wenxin ran faster. Within seconds, Cao Wenxin successfully caught the robber and got the handbag back. The middle-aged woman who had been robbed thanked Cao Wenxin repeatedly. And since the handbag was back, the middle-aged woman didn’t bother to call the police.

Coincidentally, Xu Jinchen and Xin Bei who were sitting by the window saw the scene. At that moment, Xin Bei changed his bad impression of Cao Wenxin.

“It’s surprising that Cao Wenxin is good at fighting!” Xu Jinchen was greatly surprised. “And she’s so brave.”

“She is, but also too impulsive. Sometimes, she shouldn’t dash out and get involved,” Xin Bei said.

Xu Jinchen smiled, but didn’t say anything.

“They’re walking upstairs. Why don’t we invite them to dine together?” Xu Jinchen said.

“Whatever,” Xin Bei said in an unfriendly tone.

“I guess you really dislike her. It was just a misunderstanding, so why can’t you let it go?” Xu Jinchen didn’t understand why Xin Bei suddenly became so mean. Besides, Xin Bei had been talking and laughing with him just then. However, once Cao Wenxin appeared, Xin Bei looked so cold and serious. “Fine, if you don’t want to see her, I won’t invite them. Let’s just pretend that we don’t see them when they come over later.”

Xin Bei frowned a little. He moved his lips, but didn’t say anything.
