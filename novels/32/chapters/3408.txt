3411 Fine, You Win

“Do you believe in ghosts?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

She wasn’t afraid that Zhang Huan would pose a threat to her!

“Why do you ask such a question?” Zhang Huan asked, with a faint suspicion in his heart.

Could it be that Yu Qin had turned into a ghost and let this woman see her?

No, how could there be ghosts in this world!

If Yu Qin had become a ghost, why didn’t she come to see him?

At his first reaction to the idea that Yu Qin might become a ghost, he didn’t feel scared, but rather wondered why she didn’t come to see him.

Perhaps he really would be afraid, but even so, he still wanted to see her.

After all, he loved her so much!

If Yu Qin hadn’t gotten together with Cheng Qi, she wouldn’t have lost her life!

Unfortunately, there was no way to know earlier. If he had known earlier, no matter what means he used, he wouldn’t have let them be together.

“If Yu Qin became a ghost and came to see you, would you be afraid?” Leng Xiaoyao asked. She wanted to test him.

“I would be afraid, but I still want her to come and see me. I didn’t even get to see her for the last time.” Zhang Huan admitted that he was afraid of ghosts, but if it was Yu Qin, he still wanted to see her.

“After Yu Qin had an accident, I went to the scene and saw Yu Qin’s ghost. She told me that Cheng Qi and Yu Xue conspired to murder her,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“What?” Zhang Huan was stunned when he heard that and wondered if he had misheard.

Leng Xiaoyao continued. “Then she took me to her company and found the hidden camera in the corner. Inside was the process of Cheng Qi and Yu Xue murdering her. Then she told me what her company’s official Weibo account was, and I posted the video online.”

Zhang Huan was dumbfounded. He found it incredible and doubted the truth of what Leng Xiaoyao said because it was beyond his understanding of the world.

Despite his doubts, Zhang Huan still asked, “What about Yu Qin?”

Yu Qin was still his biggest concern.

“She reincarnated. Before reincarnating, she asked me to thank you for solving this matter so quickly,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Zhang Huan was very sad, not only because Yu Qin had died, but also because even if Yu Qin had become a ghost, she didn’t come to see him.

Zhang Huan was stunned. Obviously, he didn’t expect that Yu Qin was also there during those three days at the funeral parlor.

Since ordinary people couldn’t see the existence of ghosts, even if Yu Qin came to see him, he wouldn’t be able to see her.

“I’m an outsider and have no right to tell you not to be sad, but the dead cannot be resurrected. The living should live well. You still have parents and relatives. If they see you like this, they will also be very sad,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She saw that Zhang Huan was in a bad condition, so she wanted to console him.

Zhang Huan listened to her words and suddenly became more energetic.

“Also, I don’t want anyone else to know about it. Otherwise, it may cause trouble for me.” Leng Xiaoyao reminded him.

“Okay, I won’t tell anyone.” Zhang Huan promised. He knew what the consequences would be if this news was spread. Since Leng Xiaoyao kindly told him these things, he certainly couldn’t harm her.

With that said, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t say anything more and left. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Zhang Huan’s friends didn’t eavesdrop on their conversation, so they didn’t hear what they were saying clearly, although they were curious.

After Leng Xiaoyao left, Zhang Huan’s friends went to see how he was doing. Seeing that he was feeling better, they were slightly relieved.

Zhang Huan didn’t tell his friends about what Leng Xiaoyao said. Since he had promised Leng Xiaoyao, she was his friend too and he wouldn’t say anything.

If he heard it outside, it wouldn’t be his business.

…

Originally, Leng Xiaoyao planned to give the jade to Xiao Yuming the day after she cut it out, but he happened to be out of the country and wouldn’t be back for a week. So she didn’t see Xiao Yuming until the day after she met Zhang Huan.

It was Sunday, so there was no need to go to school.

Leng Xiaoyao had a boyfriend, while Xiao Yuming was a big star. Therefore, to avoid any unnecessary misunderstandings and troubles, they arranged to meet at Xiaoyao Technology.

They agreed to meet at 10 am, but Leng Xiaoyao arrived early because she didn’t have time to come to the company during weekdays and only had time on Sundays.

Who’s the Ruler had been online for a week, with over a million downloads. It was still on Weibo’s hot search list. The topic and positive reviews had been continuous.

XY Jade Jewelry also registered an official Weibo account and product website.

The jade jewelry in the game had also received a lot of attention and had sold several pieces. Buyers had all come to the company in person because items worth tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan couldn’t be purchased online.

When it was almost 10 am, Xiao Yuming arrived. Leng Xiaoyao hadn’t told him what kind of jade it was yet, but he knew that it was definitely top-quality.

“Jade. Where is the jade? Let me see it.” As soon as Xiao Yuming arrived, he couldn’t wait to see the jade.

When Leng Xiaoyao saw Xiao Yuming, she frowned slightly. His forehead was a little dark, which wasn’t serious, but it could lead to a bloody disaster.

“I don’t have an exquisite packaging box at home, only plastic bags,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Fine, you win.” Xiao Yuming looked defeated, but he didn’t dwell on it and immediately opened it to take a look.

Xiao Yuming didn’t know much about jade, but he knew that the jade Leng Xiaoyao brought was extremely good.

“What kind of jade is this? How much does it cost?” Xiao Yuming asked.

“This is an old-pit glass type, among the best goods. I’ll sell it to you for three million yuan. It’s not a high price and I’ll make a profit too,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Although Xiao Yuming didn’t know the specific price of jade, he had been to Province Yun a few times and knew the approximate price. This old-pit glass type jade was worth at least thirty million yuan, so it was indeed a low price.

The reason why Leng Xiaoyao would also make a profit was because of the difference between the cost of raw jade materials and the price of jade, but it was extremely difficult to get a piece of jade.

Who knew how many raw jade materials would be wasted in the process?

Jade was really not cheap.
