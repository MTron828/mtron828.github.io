“He isn’t in the capital right now, because he left for work,” said Gu Ning. “I can give him a call and tell him to come back right now.”

It was a big thing that Jing Yunyao was back, and Gu Ning wanted to tell Leng Shaoting the good news as soon as possible.

Saying that, Gu Ning took out her phone and was about to call Leng Shaoting.

“Wait.” Jing Yunyao stopped Gu Ning. “I’m not mentally-prepared yet. Can you take me to where I’ve lived before? I want to see whether I can remember anything.”

“No problem.” Gu Ning respected Jing Yunyao’s decision. “We can go to the Leng family’s old house, and you can put on your mask if you don’t want to expose your identity.”

As for the reason to visit the Leng family’s old house, Gu Ning had her own idea.

“Great.” Jing Yunyao nodded.

“I still need to call Shaoting now, but I won’t mention you. You don’t need to be worried,” said Gu Ning.

“Great.” Jing Yunyao nodded.

After that, Gu Ning called Leng Shaoting.

“Ningning, what’s wrong?” Leng Shaoting asked once he picked up her call.

Normally, Gu Ning only called him for something important.

Jing Yunyao was a senior cultivator, so she had good hearing and cried the second she heard Leng Shaoting’s voice. Although she lost her memories, she knew that Leng Shaoting was her son now and failed to control her emotions.

Gu Ning felt sorry for that, but there was nothing she could do about it.

“Shaoting, I found several books in your parents’ room before, and I want to read them now. Can you tell Grandpa Leng that I’ll visit him later,” said Gu Ning. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Leng Shaoting didn’t mind Gu Ning going into his parents’ room, but he was absent now, so they had to ask for Master Leng’s permission.

“Sure.” Leng Shaoting agreed, because there indeed were many good books in his parents’ room.

Afterwards, Leng Shaoting called his grandfather.

Master Leng didn’t think it was a big deal, so he agreed.

After he finished the call with Leng Shaoting, he called Gu Ning and said, “Ningning, you don’t need to ask for my permission before you come. We’re a family, and you can come to see me whenever you want.”

Even though Gu Ning did it out of politeness, he sincerely took her as his granddaughter-in-law.

Jing Yunyao also heard Master Leng’s voice and she felt his voice sounded familiar too.

“Thanks, grandpa,” Gu Ning said.

“Alright, why don’t you come earlier so that we can dine together?” Master Leng said.

“I just remembered that,” said Gu Ning.

“Fine, come to see me now,” said Master Leng.

“Sure, I’m on my way,” said Gu Ning.

After that, they hung up the call.

The dishes were already placed on the table, so Gu Ning began to enjoy the meal.

Jing Yunyao, however, lost her appetite. Gu Ning tried to persuade her to have some food, but Jing Yunyao couldn’t have any. Gu Ning understood that she wanted to go to the Leng family’s old house, so she quickly finished the meal.

Jing Yunyao knew that she had affected Gu Ning’s appetite, and apologized to her, but Gu Ning didn’t mind it at all. Actually, Gu Ning wanted to help Jing Yunyao get her memories back too.

When they were leaving, Gu Ning paid the bill before Jing Yunyao. Since she realized that Jing Yunyao was Leng Shaoting’s mother, she shouldn’t let her pay the bill.

Jing Yunyao wanted to pay the bill by herself, but Gu Ning did it first, so she had to give up.

After that, they went to the Leng family’s old house together.

Jing Yunyao was quite nervous upon thinking that she was going to where she had lived before.

“Although we’re not very sure of your relationship with the Leng family yet, I believe that you’re Shaoting’s mother. I’m Shaoting’s girlfriend, and we’ll be together forever if no accidents happens. In that case, you’ll be my mother-in-law. Can I directly call you mother?” asked Gu Ning.

“Sure.” Jing Yunyao agreed.

She wasn’t surprised that Gu Ning was Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend, because they had traveled alone together. Because she wasn’t aware of the purpose of Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s travel to Kunlun Mountain, she believed that they traveled for fun.

Many mothers-in-law had a lot of standards for their daughters-in-law, but Jing Yunyao was an exception. She hadn’t seen Leng Shaoting for years, and she had been an absent mother for years too.

All of a sudden, Jing Yunyao thought of an important question and asked Gu Ning, “Why do you believe that I’m Yunyao?”
