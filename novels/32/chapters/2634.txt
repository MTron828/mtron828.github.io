Chapter 2637: You Don’t Deserve Me!

Upon hearing that, Chu Peihan was annoyed. She wasn’t together with Han Chenglin yet, but Han Chenglin’s younger aunt already wanted her to leave him. It was dramatic.

Since she didn’t respect her, Chu Peihan wouldn’t care about her face either. She sneered and asked, “Did you come to say that to me on behalf of Han Chenglin and his parents? Or is it just you?”

Chu Peihan’s attitude annoyed Han Chenglin’s younger aunt. She frowned and became colder. “No matter who I represent, you don’t deserve Chenglin and our family. I know you want to marry into a rich family, but that only exists in romantic stories. It won’t happen in reality.”

“Madam, are you serious? It’s not me who doesn’t want to leave Han Chenglin. It’s he who begged me to be his girlfriend. If you think I don’t deserve him. Go tell him to stay away from me. Stop bothering me!” Chu Peihan mocked.

Han Jingxue wasn’t young at about forty years old, but she still got angry at the way Chu Peihan talked to her. She thought that Chu Peihan was being extremely disrespectful.

However, she didn’t bother to waste time arguing. She directly said to Chu Peihan, “He’s been seduced by you, so he doesn’t want to leave you. Do you think he really likes you? There are countless girls who are better than you. And he’ll fall in love with someone better. If you leave him now, it’ll be a good thing for you. Don’t waste my kindness.”

“Thank you for your compliment. I know I’m charming, but I don’t need your care and you have no right to judge me,” said Chu Peihan aggressively.

“You…” Han Jingxue got angry. She thought that Chu Peihan was rude and unpleasant, but why should Chu Peihan listen to her?

“Do you want money? Fine, I can give you money. You can have five hundred thousand yuan so leave Chenglin,” said Han Jingxue. The next moment, she took out a card. it was prepared before she came. Afterwards, she threw it to Chu Peihan. “Here, there is five hundred thousand yuan. No password.”

Before she did that, Chu Peihan was already angry. As a result, once she did that, Chu Peihan couldn’t stand it any longer. She hit the table heavily making a loud sound in the café. Everyone turned to look at her in surprise.

Chu Peihan didn’t care about them. She glared straight at Han Jingxue and said, “Ms. Han, as a lady born in a wealthy family, how can you be so impolite. Don’t you have any sense of respect? It has nothing to do with me whether you have manners, but you can’t have my respect if you don’t respect me. Since you dare to humiliate me, don’t blame me for treating you the same way.”

Chu Peihan’s sudden anger scared Han Jingxue, making her feel stressed.

Chu Peihan was just an ordinary girl. How could she be so powerful?

......

Chu Peihan didn’t give her a chance to say anything further, and continued. “Why are you criticizing my family background? It has nothing to do with you! Hang Chenglin is your nephew, not your son. How can you throw money at my face and ask me to leave him? Does he know about this? Are you respecting him by doing this? How will he feel about it after he knows?”

Upon hearing that, onlookers gave Han Jingxue accusatory glances. They hated selfish and self-centered rich people the most, because they always liked to humiliate other people.

Han Jingxue was extremely embarrassed. She got angry since other people were all looking at her.

“You…” Right when Han Jingxue was about to say something again, Chu Peihan interrupted. “Five hundred thousand yuan? Do you think I’m really poor? Or do you believe that your family is the richest family in the world? To be honest with you, I don’t think your family deserves me. In fact, if you became rich on your own, you’d have my respect. However, if you rely on your parents to have so much money, I’ll only disdain you.”

Afterwards, Chu Peihan stood up and walked away. She was unwilling to pay more attention to Han Jingxue.

As for the coffee, she would let Han Jingxue pay the bill. Anyway, she didn’t even take a sip.

“You…” Han Jingxue abruptly stood up. Watching Chu Peihan’s retreating back, she was full of anger.

This girl called Chu Peihan was so aggressive! How could she do this!?

Chu Peihan didn’t keep it a secret from Han Chenglin. As soon as she was out of the café, she called him.

“Han Chenglin, I don’t want to see you today,” said Chu Peihan grumpily.

Han Chenglin could hear that she was mad. He was confused and asked with concern, “What’s wrong? Did anything go wrong?”

“Your younger aunt just came to see me. She said she will give me five hundred thousand yuan, but I should leave you. She even said I don’t deserve you and your family. If so, I think we shouldn’t be together, bye.” The moment Chu Peihan finished, she hung up.

She knew it wasn’t Han Chenglin’s fault and she shouldn’t blame him for it, but she was too angry. She could only vent her anger on him.

She didn’t really mean that she would leave him. She had no intention of avoiding him. Han Jingxue was a nobody in her eyes. However, if it was Han Chenglin’s parents, she might consider leaving him. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

She didn’t know whether it had anything to do with Han Chenglin’s parents yet, so she had to take it slowly. Before Han Chenglin’s parents showed their attitude, she wouldn’t easily make a decision about her relationship with Han Chenglin.

Nevertheless, Han Jingxue was too awful! She would leave her to Han Chenglin. If Han Chenglin could handle it well, she might accept him as her boyfriend.

If Han Chenglin really liked her, he wouldn’t allow anyone to humiliate her like that. He didn’t need to become enemies with his younger aunt, but he had to deal with it.

…

When Han Chenglin heard what happened, he was very mad, because it wasn’t the first time that Han Jingxue had caused him trouble.

Han Chenglin really hated Han Jingxue ever since he was little, because she was a selfish woman. She never stopped interfering in other people’s business. She had divorced twice for a reason.
