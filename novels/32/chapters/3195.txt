3198 Let Me Help You Release Your Anger

“Boss, your idea is amazing! Although there will be copies of popular things, jewelry is still rare,” Mu Yufan said excitedly. He felt that Leng Xiaoyao had a lot of talent when it came to business. They could kill two birds with one stone.

Thank you readers!

However, if it didn’t become popular, it would be a waste of their energy. Anyway, they could doubt other people’s abilities, but they would never doubt Leng Xiaoyao’s.

“Right, once the game becomes popular, the jewelry will be famous too.” Zhou Yunkai agreed.

“I’ll register for a jewelry company after I go to the capital city. Shen Xiyin will work with you here for the time being. She’s the fiancée of the An family’s heir. Don’t treat her unfairly, or the An family and I will pay you back,” Leng Xiaoyao warned. She trusted them, but it was necessary for her to remind them to be nice.

Hearing that Shen Xiyin was the fiancée of the An family’s heir, Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai were both surprised.

“Don’t worry, boss, we won’t treat Miss Shen unfairly.” Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai promised. Even if Leng Xiaoyao didn’t remind them to be nice, they would still behave themselves. Anyway, since Leng Xiaoyao said that, they would be more careful.

Leng Xiaoyao only said that to them because she cared about Shen Xiyin very much.

Afterwards, Leng Xiaoyao told Mu Yufan to prepare an office for Shen Xiyin, then she took Shen Xiyin to have a tour of the company.

Because there weren’t enough employees, several offices were empty. As the designer, Shen Xiyin needed a quiet place, so she asked for a separate office.

After getting familiar with the company, Shen Xiyin needed to know about the game characters, especially those she would design jewelry and magic weapons for.

Leng Xiaoyao had only drawn a few characters so far, so Shen Xiyin learned about them first. She would wait till Leng Xiaoyao was done for the rest.

Shen Xiyin would design jewelry and magic weapons according to the descriptions and images of those characters.

After looking at the few characters, Shen Xiyin had ideas. She would start designing when she got back.

To prevent the designs from being leaked, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t let Shen Xiyin have the draft of those characters.

Leng Xiaoyao trusted Shen Xiyin, but even Mu Yufan and the others could only see the character’s draft on Leng Xiaoyao’s laptop.

Leng Xiaoyao and Shen Xiyin didn’t leave the company until 5 pm.

In the afternoon, Shen Xiyin was busy with work, so she forgot about Zhang Kelu for the time being. By the time she remembered it when her work was done, she wasn’t as sad.

That was the reason why many people occupied themselves with work when they were sad. Once you got busy, you had no time to be sad.

Because Shen Xiyin felt much better, Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t so worried about her and let her drive the car.

It wasn’t early and was about to be rush hour. The Leng family lived in the opposite direction of Shen Xiyin’s home, so Leng Xiaoyao didn’t ask Shen Xiyin to send her home. Shen Xiyin could go home, while Leng Xiaoyao went to take a taxi.

Leng Xiaoyao had told Leng Changyuan that she would come home. When she got out of the plane today, she gave Leng Changyuan a call and said that she wouldn’t come home right away, but she would be home after having dinner.

When she finally got home, it wasn’t yet 6 pm. The other family members weren’t home yet, so Leng Changyuan was alone in the house.

“Grandpa, what happened? Who angered you? Tell me, and I’ll teach the person a lesson,” asked Leng Xiaoyao. She understood why Leng Changyuan put on that face, but she deliberately joked with him.

“It’s you. No one else dares to anger me. After you’ve changed, you barely stay at home. You’re always gone. I hardly see you.” Leng Changyuan complained. Although he wasn’t really mad, he meant what he said.

Leng Xiaoyao immediately went up to massage Leng Changyuan’s shoulders. “Oh, it’s me who angered you, grandpa. I’ve just grown up. I have a lot of things to deal with. I can’t hide under your protection forever, or I’ll become useless.”

“You’re so young! I don’t see other teenagers who are as busy as you,” Leng Changyuan said disgruntledly. Actually, he was really proud of Leng Xiaoyao for her outstanding abilities at such a young age, but at the same time, he didn’t think that Leng Xiaoyao should take on so much pressure at her age.

However, he couldn’t interfere in Leng Xiaoyao’s decisions. Like Leng Xiaoyao said, she couldn’t hide under his protection forever. He was old and could only live a few more years. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

If Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t become independent, she would have a hard life in the future.

“Don’t you feel proud of me for my outstanding abilities at my age? Have you seen another young person who is as skilled as me? So, I think that you should be proud of me,” Leng Xiaoyao said seriously.

Leng Changyuan was struck dumb for a moment.

“I know I’m always gone these days, but I’ll try to spend more time with you, grandpa. Can you forgive me?” Leng Xiaoyao asked. She knew that she had neglected Leng Changyuan recently, but she could do nothing about that. After all, she needed to manage her business.

“Alright, you can come back to see me when you have time. If there is anything you need to deal with, you can leave,” Leng Changyuan said.

Even though he was unhappy because Leng Xiaoyao was barely home, he understood that she had a lot of things to deal with. If he asked too much from her, her business would be affected.

“Grandpa, you’re the best.” Leng Xiaoyao immediately leaned on Leng Changyuan’s shoulders and acted cute. Although Leng Changyuan was very considerate, she decided to spend more time with her grandfather, otherwise, she would have even less time to see Leng Changyuan after she went to university.

“Ha-ha.” Leng Changyuan felt resigned yet happily.

“Oh, grandpa, I need to move some raw jade materials over later. I want to store them at home for a while. So I need an underground storage room,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She could directly do that, but she felt it was better to tell Leng Changyuan beforehand.

“Raw jade materials? You bought raw jade materials?” asked Leng Changyuan. He knew that Leng Xiaoyao had gone to City Yun, but he didn’t know that she actually went to take part in the stone-gambling event.
