3156 It’s Not a Good Thing

“I don’t know whether it’s a child-mother worm or a single worm right now, because I need to know enough details to make a judgment. I need to ask you some questions, but are you willing to tell me?” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Of course, I can tell you everything you are allowed to know. If you can’t, I won’t tell you,” Li Mochen said. Because he didn’t know what Leng Xiaoyao was going to ask, he couldn’t promise that he would tell her everything.

“Sure, when did it happen to you for the first time?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Three years ago, May 15th,” Li Mochen said.

!!

“How often does it happen?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Once every month or two. There is no fixed time, so I can’t tell when the next time will be. I’ll just stay alert when a month passes,” Li Mochen said.

“In that case, the worm should have been set inside your body two months before you had the first attack. Who did you see during those two months? What happened? If you had no idea when the worm was put in your body, you should be suspicious of everyone and everything,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Li Mochen was so strong, but he felt nothing when the worm entered his body. Therefore, the person should be very skilled or someone he really trusted.

Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t straightforward, but Li Mochen understood what she was implying.

Without delay, Li Mochen thought about whom he had seen and what had happened during those two months. His subordinates were also suspects.

Although it wasn’t something to be proud of, only people who were close to him could do it. Before the truth comes out, he must be careful.

At the same time, he wouldn’t doubt or make things difficult for anyone publicly.

Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t ask him whom he had seen and what had happened during the two months.

Li Mochen also didn’t rush to think about it in detail. Instead, he asked Leng Xiaoyao, “Since you know I’m under the effect of poisonous magic, do you know how to get rid of it?”

“Yeah, but it’s not easy. Don’t worry, I’ll figure out a way as soon as possible. I’ll give you a Taoist talisman tomorrow when we meet. If you have a relapse again, the talisman will help you. Although it can’t completely stop the poisonous worm from hurting you, you will feel much less pain, like today. A talisman can be used three times. After three times, it should be destroyed. I can draw as many talismans as I want, so you don’t need to worry about that, but I hope I can help you get rid of the poisonous worm before you have the next attack,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Li Mochen was relieved.

No matter how difficult it was, there was a hope that he could recover.

When Li Mochen heard about the talisman, he was very surprised although he knew that there were all kinds of strange things in the world and that there was a poisonous worm in his body.

After finding out about the existence of these things he was mentally-prepared and could accept it.

“You have a lot of skills!” Li Mochen said. Even if he was aware that Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t an ordinary person, he had never asked about what she was really doing.

“Because I’m not an ordinary human. I have superpowers that other people don’t have, but I can’t tell you any details right now. You’ll know as time goes by,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Li Mochen felt that Leng Xiaoyao trusted him very much since she frankly told him that she had superpowers, so he gradually started to trust her as well.

“I don’t know how to return your kindness after you did me such big favors. If you need anything, feel free to let me know. As long as I can, I won’t hesitate to help you,” Li Mochen said.

“Sure,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Leng Xiaoyao stopped after pouring magical power into Li Mochen’s body for about twenty minutes, but she didn’t leave right away. Instead, she observed for a while to see whether the poisonous worm would act up again.

Twenty minutes later, nothing happened and Li Mochen’s condition didn’t get worse, so Leng Xiaoyao was relieved.

The attack of the poisonous magic would last for an hour. Now forty minutes had passed, so it wouldn’t happen again today.

“Brother Mochen, I need to go now. You should be fine tonight, but you can call me if something happens,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Great.” Li Mochen answered, then he sincerely thanked Leng Xiaoyao. “Xiaoyao, thank you.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“My pleasure.” Leng Xiaoyao grinned.

Afterwards, Leng Xiaoyao left.

When Leng Xiaoyao was gone, Li Mochen rested for another dozen minutes till the pain completely faded, but his body was still weak, so he didn’t go to see Mo Jingxuan and the others. He only sent Mo Jingxuan a message, telling them that he couldn’t go back right now. They could go if they wanted.

In that case, Mo Jingxuan and the others didn’t stay and wait for Li Mochen. They separated after that.

…

Leng Xiaoyao left directly for the Leng family’s mansion.

When she got back home it was still early and wasn’t even 10 pm yet. Leng Changyuan and the others were still up.

Once Leng Xiaoyao was back, Leng Changyuan brought up what happened tonight with great happiness.

“Yaoyao was the focus tonight! Many people couldn’t stop complimenting her,” Leng Changyuan said proudly.

“Right! Many young men even want to chase Yaoyao after knowing that her engagement with Chu Jianan has ended,” Leng Yecheng said.

Upon hearing that, Song Meiyu was displeased. She hated that Leng Xiaoyao was so popular.

Leng Changyuan was also unhappy about that. “That’s not a good thing. They’re only interested in Yaoyao’s beautiful appearance. She had freckles all over her face before, so they paid no attention to her. Now Yaoyao is attractive, so I don’t think they deserve her.”

“I know Yaoyao doesn’t like them, so I said nothing. It’s just their dreams,” Leng Yecheng said.

Song Meiyu couldn’t stand it any longer when they thought so highly of Leng Xiaoyao. “People are realistic nowadays. Everyone wants to have a marriage between families of equal social status. You may be hurt if you marry into a family which has a higher status than yours.”
