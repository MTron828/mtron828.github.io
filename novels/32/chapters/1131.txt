1132 Mrs. Guo

“What they’ve done is illegal, and they should be punished according to the law.”

“...”

Other people all began to criticize the woman and those reporters behind her.

“Ma’am, what do you want to say right now?” Gu Ning turned to look at the woman.

“I-I-I...” the woman stammered, because she didn’t dare tell them that it was Jiang Shuyuan who told her to do it. However, if she didn’t say it aloud, she would have to bear the result herself, which was the last thing she wanted to do now.

She did it for Jiang Shuyuan after all.

All of a sudden, she questioned Fang Dongcheng, “Why did you allow her to play the video?”

“Why couldn’t I allow her to play the video?” Fang Dongcheng frowned. “It’s necessary to find out the truth before we take the action.”

“Didn’t I tell you to help me?” the woman said.

Hearing that, other people were surprised and realized what this woman had done beforehand. It turned out that she had bribed the police to trap Charm! She was so well-prepared.

“Ma’am, I’m afraid that you’re mistaking me for another person. We were sent here by the Public Security Bureau instead of the nearby police station,” Fang Dongcheng coldly said.

In fact, he already figured out the reason why Leng Shaoting had called him when he heard Gu Ning’s account. Leng Shaoting didn’t call the nearby police station, because he didn’t trust it.

“What? The Public Security Bureau? How is it possible?” The woman rounded her eyes in shock.

“Now we have enough evidence to prove that you’re guilty of ruining the reputation of Charm. Please come to the Public Security Bureau with me for the investigation,” Fang Dongcheng said with a serious face.

Those reporters were astonished. If they were arrested by the police, they would lose their job.

“No, you can’t arrest me. I’m the wife of the director of Changyue Organization,” the woman told her identity at once, trying to stop the police from arresting her.

Changyue Organization was a famous, large business corporation in the capital, and it was owned by the Guo family which was a super-rich family.

People turned to look at Gu Ning with sympathy, because they believed that she had to bite her tongue this time.

None of them knew how influential Gu Ning was, so they thought that she was just an ordinary girl. Even if some of them were aware that she was the owner of Jade Beauty Jewelry and Charm, they didn’t think that she was more powerful than the Guo family.

Changyue Organization was a well-known large business after all.

In fact, if Gu Ning was an ordinary girl, she indeed would have had to hold her tongue because she was merely nobody in front of Mrs. Guo.

Fang Dongcheng, however, wasn’t afraid at all, because he came here for the Leng family’s sake.

“I don’t care how powerful your family is, you must be punished according to the law given what you’ve done,” Fang Dongcheng said.

Everyone was impressed by his honesty.

“You...” Mrs. Guo didn’t expect that this policeman dared behave against Changyue Organization, and she felt utterly humiliated. “How dare you say that to my face! If you dare arrest me today, I’ll make you lose your job.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“If you want to make me lose my job, you must know who I am first.” Fang Dongcheng stayed calm. “Mrs. Guo, please allow me to introduce myself. I’m the director of Dongcheng District Branch of the Public Security Bureau, Fang Dongcheng.”

Knowing that, everyone was shocked again.

What? He’s the director of Dongcheng District Branch of the Public Security Bureau?

They were surprised that the director would come here in person.

Gu Ning, however, wasn’t surprised, because she knew Leng Shaoting wouldn’t call an unimportant person.

“What?” Mrs. Guo was stunned at this moment. She couldn’t believe that Gu Ning was able to get the help from a director.

“Mrs. Guo, do you still want to resist arrest?” Fang Dongcheng said. “If you insist on doing this, I can also sue you.”

“I-I...” Mrs. Guo didn’t know what to say now.

She wanted to use Jiang Shuyuan’s influence to help herself out, but was afraid that Jiang Shuyuan would be mad at her. As a result, she thought that she could call Jiang Shuyuan at the Public Security Bureau later.

In the end, Mrs. Guo and those reporters had to follow Fang Dongcheng to the Public Security Bureau.

Before they left, Gu Ning said to those reporters, “I don’t care what you’ve posted on the Internet not long ago about this drama, but you must delete it as soon as possible.”

“In addition, you should also post the truth out to clear my name, or you’ll bear the result yourself.”

Those reporters felt scared, looking at Gu Ning’s serious expression.
