Chapter 1122 Where Is the Intruder?

Since Zhang Zhiheng said that, Wang Shijie could only choose to believe in Leng Shaoting and hope that he would be fine....

Gu Ning didn’t want to waste more time on fighting, in case the others saw them from the surveillance cameras, so she let the jiao out at once.

The second the jiao appeared out of blue, the Gu Eagle was shocked. “Jiao?”

Although the Gu Eagle was also an ancient monster, it still felt shocked when it saw the jiao.

Leng Shaoting also rounded his eyes in shock because this was the first time that he had seen a jiao in real life.

“Jiao, kill it now.” Gu Ning made an order.

“Yes, master,” the jiao said, then attacked the Gu Eagle like lightning. The Gu Eagle wanted to escape, but the jiao caught it and wrapped it with its body.

“Ningning, are you alright?” Leng Shaoting asked worriedly. When he saw the wounds left on Gu Ning’s body by the Gu Eagle, his heart ached.

“I’m fine. The wounds will all disappear soon, but you should take another pill now,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was relieved. He listened to Gu Ning and took another power crystal.

Afterwards, they stood aside and watched the jiao fighting against the Gu Eagle.

Even though Leng Shaoting already knew that the jiao and the Gu Eagle were real, he still felt like it was too unbelievable to be true.

The Gu Eagle was soon out of strength, and the jiao got control of it.

“Let me go!” The Gu Eagle struggled hard, but unfortunately failed to escape. “We have no grudge against each other. Why do you have to do this to me?”

“No grudge? Didn’t you say you’re going to have me for dessert? You’ve eaten three soldiers, and you should pay for it!” Gu Ning said, then turned to the jiao. “Jiao, absorb its energy and let it disappear.”

“No!” the Gu Eagle shouted. “I’m sorry, please don’t do that. I promise I won’t...”

However, before it could finish the sentence, the jiao absorbed its energy little by little, and it became weak and transparent over time. In the end, it disappeared into thin air.

Witnessing the scene, Leng Shaoting was shocked. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The jiao went back to Gu Ning after killing the Gu Eagle. Leng Shaoting was a little afraid of it, because he knew that it wasn’t a kind creature. Even though Gu Ning told him that it listened to her now, it was still dangerous.

The jiao gave Leng Shaoting a glance and it seemed friendly to him, because it understood that Leng Shaoting was close to Gu Ning.

“My master, you haven’t let me be in the water for a long time,” the jiao said in an aggrieved tone.

Hearing that, Gu Ning remembered that the jiao had left the water for too long.

“Sure, I’ll put you in the water once I’m back,” Gu Ning said.

“Thanks.” The jiao was satisfied.

After that, Gu Ning put it back into the telepathic eye space.

“Ningning, is it safe for you to keep the jiao with you?” Leng Shaoting couldn’t help but ask worriedly.

Gu Ning understood that Leng Shaoting was worried about her, so she explained with a smile. “Relax, it’s safe.”

Since Gu Ning said that, Leng Shaoting could only believe it.

Afterwards, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting left.

The Gu Eagle was already killed, and Leng Shaoting had to make a reasonable explanation for the three missing soldiers.

...

Zhang Zhiheng and Wang Shijie, who were in the surveillance room, saw Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning walking back.

They were relieved when they saw that Leng Shaoting was fine, but where was the intruder?

They got curious and thought that the intruder might have escaped. If so, it would be a shame.

They believed that they could only find the three missing soldiers by catching the intruder. If the intruder escaped, they wouldn’t know how the three soldiers got lost. Anyway, at least Leng Shaoting was safe, which was good news for them.

When Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were about to reach the exit, Zhang Zhiheng and Wang Shijie went outside to welcome them.

In the distance, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning saw Zhang Zhiheng and Wang Shijie. They weren’t surprised because they knew that Zhang Zhiheng must have noticed them in the surveillance cameras.

“Nice to see you, Major General Leng!” Zhang Zhiheng and Wang Shijie saluted Leng Shaoting at once, then they turned to look at Gu Ning and were stunned.

They were surprised because Gu Ning was very young in their eyes. Even though they couldn’t see her clearly in the surveillance cameras, they knew that this girl was quite excellent at fighting. They were also impressed by her beauty.

“Nice to see you too,” Leng Shaoting said. “I need to go back now, and I’ll come to explain it tomorrow.”

Leng Shaoting had no intention to introduce Gu Ning to them, nor explain what had happened in the woods to them right now.

“No problem,” Zhang Zhiheng and Wang Shijie said, then watched Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning getting in the car.

“Why didn’t Major General Leng tell us right now? I’m curious to know what has happened in the woods!” Wang Shijie said once Leng Shaoting was gone.

“Since Major General Leng said that he’ll come again tomorrow, we can only wait,” Zhang Zhiheng said.

“By the way, who’s the girl?” Zhang Zhiheng asked.

“No idea, but she’s very beautiful,” Wang Shijie said. “Why is Major General Leng alone with her?”
