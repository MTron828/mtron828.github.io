Chapter 660 Future Father-in-law

Before Leng Shaoting could explain, Cao Wenxin said, “Well, it’s the first time that he has visited his future father-in-law so, of course, he should bring some gifts.”

Cao Wenxin was right. It would be impolite if Leng Shaoting didn’t bring any gifts to visit his future father-in-law for the first time. Nobody would like an impolite man.

Hearing that, Gu Ning understood, but Leng Shaoting brought too many gifts with him! However, he had already prepared so many gifts, so Gu Ning didn’t say anything further.

Because there were too many gifts, Leng Shaoting couldn’t carry all of them alone. Gu Ning then told Qiao Ya to help him.

Gu Ning didn’t carry some herself, because she wasn’t a guest.

In the Tang family’s house, Tang Haifeng was in the study, and the others were chatting in the living hall. When they heard the sound of a car, they knew that Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin were back, so none of them went outside to welcome them. However, when a handsome young man appeared in their sight with so many gifts in his hands, they were all astonished.

“Hi, Shaoting, Qiao Ya!” Gu Man stood up at once. Seeing that they carried so many gifts, Gu Man said, “Why did you bring so many gifts with you? You don’t have to do that.”

Ever since Gu Man had found out that Leng Shaoting was Gu Ning’s boyfriend, she became more friendly to him. Gu Ning believed that Leng Shaoting was her Mr. Right, so he was a member of their family, and Gu Man naturally wanted to treat him well.

“Nice to see you again!” Leng Shaoting greeted her politely.

“Nice to see you, Madam,” Qiao Ya said.

“Come in and have a seat!” Jiang Lihua said to them with a smile.

They walked in the living hall later, and Leng Shaoting put the gifts down on the nearby table.

“So nice to meet you, Mr. Tang and Mrs. Tang,” Leng Shaoting greeted the other members in the Tang family. He did his best to sound kind, but it wasn’t very natural. Luckily, nobody noticed that.

“Nice to meet you, Mr. Tang and Mrs. Tang,” Qiao Ya said.

“Have a seat please!” Tang Yunfan said. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After that, they were all seated.

“Please let me introduce you, this is Qiao Ya who is my assistant.” Gu Ning introduced Qiao Ya first, then turned to Leng Shaoting. She knew that it would be shocking when they found out about Leng Shaoting’s relationship with her. “And this is my boyfriend, Leng Shaoting,” Gu Ning added.

Hearing that, everyone was shocked and couldn’t believe their ears.

“What? Boyfriend?” At the same time, they remembered that Tang Haifeng had told them about that. Gu Ning already had a boyfriend at 18.

In fact, the Tang family thought that 18 was too early for a girl to date someone.

Tang Yunfan was especially displeased, because he had just found his biological daughter, and now another man grabbed her away? Therefore, Tang Yunfan wore a cold expression, and stared straight at Leng Shaoting, which was quite stressful. However, Leng Shaoting wasn’t afraid to meet Tang Yunfan’s eyes at all, and stayed calm, which surprised Tang Yunfan.

Although he was displeased that Gu Ning already had a boyfriend at such a young age, he thought that he didn’t have the right to interfere in her personal life since he had been an absent father for so many years. In addition, he knew that Gu Ning was a mature girl, and her boyfriend must be an outstanding and reliable man too.

Even so, Tang Yunfan still needed to know more about Leng Shaoting.

“Where were you born?” Tang Yunfan asked with a serious face.

“The capital,” Leng Shaoting sat straight and answered the question with a serious look.

“What’s your job and title?” Tang Yunfan asked again.

“A soldier. Major general,” Leng Shaoting said.

“What?” Hearing that, everyone was shocked again, including Tang Yunfan and Tang Yunhang who were always calm.

“Were you born into the Leng family in the capital?” Tang Yunfan asked, although he already had the answer. He had only heard of one major general in his early twenties, and that was the eldest grandson of the Leng family in the capital.

Although there were few people who were aware of it, everyone in the military had heard of Leng Shaoting’s name given his legendary achievements.

Cao Ruihua held deep admiration for this young major general, and he had told his family a lot about him.

Qiao Ya was astonished too, but didn’t show it on her face, because she knew that this man couldn’t be simple.

Gu Man didn’t know how important a major general was in the military, so she wasn’t very surprised. And Cao Wenxin already knew, so she was able to stay calm.

“Yes,” Leng Shaoting said.

Hearing that, they still felt that it was quite unbelievable. However, since they already knew Leng Shaoting’s family background, they gradually approved of their relationship. In fact, the Tang family didn’t care about the family background, but they knew that the Leng family was reliable. Moreover, they all had a good impression of soldiers.

“What happened?” Hearing the noise, Tang Haifeng walked out, and noticed Gu Ning at first glance. He beamed at once, then was surprised to see Leng Shaoting. He didn’t remember that his granddaughter already had a boyfriend until Leng Shaoting appeared in his sight, and he had the same feeling as Tang Yunfan.

“Nice to see you, Master Tang.” Leng Shaoting stood up at once, and greeted Tang Haifeng with respect. “Oh, nice to see you!” Tang Haifeng said.

“Nice to meet you, Master Tang.” Qiao Ya stood up as well.

“Grandpa, she’s my assistant, Qiao Ya,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Tang Haifeng nodded as a response.
