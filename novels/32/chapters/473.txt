Chapter 474 Gu Qing and Gu Man Are Attacked

Gu Ning added, “Since you showed up in City F and have followed my mother for a couple of days, I thought that you also accepted the fact and want to have the family reunion.”

Since Gu Ning had already laid her cards on the table, Tang Yunfan thought it was time to be honest with her. “Yes, I do accept the fact that you’re my biological daughter but I still can’t regain my lost memory from that year, so I don’t dare meet your mother right now. I know that it’s irresponsible, but I still want to regain my memory before I go to meet your mother so that I can treat her with my real feelings. I don’t want to hurt her either, and I think that it’s better for all of us to maintain the status quo.”

“I agree, but aren’t you afraid that my mother might fall in love with another man before you regain your memory?” Gu Ning asked.

Gu Ning’s words made Tang Yunfan think of what he had seen last night, and he panicked a lot. “Does-does your mother has someone she likes now?”

Seeing Tang Yunfan being so anxious, Gu Ning was satisfied. “Not yet, but I plan to help her find a man. She has stayed single for 18 years, and I’m going to go study in the capital in half a year, so I don’t want her to be alone any longer. I hoped that there would be a reliable man to look after her, but since you appeared right now, I think that you two are a great match, and I hope that you can get back together.”

Hearing that, Tang Yunfan relaxed.

“Do you know why my mother named me Gu Ning?” Gu Ning asked. “Eighteen years ago, my mother was still a freshman. She rescued an injured man by accident, but the man lost his memories and wouldn’t leave my mother, so my mother called him Ning.”

Hearing the name, Ning, Tang Yunfan’s brain ached a little. He felt a strange emotion, because he had a feeling that Ning was precisely him, but he couldn’t remember any details.

Gu Ning added, “In the beginning, my mother helped him out of kindness, but they fell in love later. Ning was an able man and soon became a supervisor after only half a year in a company. He was then gradually promoted to be the manager of the planning department, but he was lost in a car accident on a business trip later. In that accident, six people were lost, including Ning.”

Hearing the story told by Gu Ning, Pieces of memory flashed through Tang Yunfan’s mind. He tried to grab them, but failed, and his brain was in great pain.

Gu Ning, however, didn’t stop, because she wanted to see whether it was useful to stimulate him. “Afterwards, my mother found out that she was pregnant, and quit school.”

In the following minutes, Gu Ning told Tang Yunfan about Gu Man’s miserable life in the Gu Family, and what they had been through during the past 18 years.

“I’m sorry. I had no idea what you had been through. I’m so sorry. I’m sorry...” Tang Yunfan repeatedly apologized. He was blaming himself.

Seeing that Tang Yunfan still couldn’t remember anything after the stimulation, Gu Ning stopped telling the story and stood up walking towards him. She gently pressed his temples and put her power into his body.

When Tang Yunfan calmed down again, Gu Ning asked, “What do you plan to do next? Do you want to meet my mom right now, or wait until you regain your memory?”

The moment Gu Ning finished her sentences and before Tang Yunfan could say a word, her phone rang, and the caller was Mrs. Fu. Mrs. Fu was the owner of a maternal and child supplies store which was next to Kamei Beauty Salon. She was also one of their members. Gu Ning had exchanged phone numbers with Mrs. Fu earlier on in case anything bad happened to Gu Qing and Gu Man and they couldn’t call her on their own. Therefore, when Gu Ning saw the caller was Mrs. Fu, she had a bad feeling. “Hi, Mrs. Fu.”

“Miss Gu, come here right now! A group of people just damaged your family’s store, but I don’t know exactly what they did in the store!” Mrs. Fu said in great anxiety.

“What? Please call the police, and I’ll be right there!” Gu Ning panicked.

“I’ll go with you!” Tang Yunfan had also heard what Mrs. Fu said on the phone.

Gu Ning didn’t reject and they ran out together. Tang Yunfan’s car was stopped downstairs, so they drove to the shopping mall without delay.

On the way, Gu Ning was thinking about who the group of people could be, and she was really worried about Gu Qing and Gu Man.

It took around 15 minutes to get there normally, but Tang Yunfan and Gu Ning arrived within seven minutes.

The beauty salon was already in a mess when they finally arrived. Even though the police were here, those who had damaged the store were gone.

“Miss, you can’t come in here.” When Gu Ning walked inside, a policeman stopped her.

“I’m the daughter of the owner,” Gu Ning said. And then Gu Ning, followed by Tang Yunfan, walked inside.

In order to not let Gu Man recognize him, Tang Yunfan put on his mask.

There were many injured people in the store, including Gu Qing and Gu Man. Gu Man was the most seriously injured one among them, because her head was bleeding and she had already passed out. The ambulance hadn’t arrived yet, so Gu Man could only lie on the sofa. Gu Qing stood by her side but was crying anxiously.

Gu Qing’s arm was hit by a steel stick and the other staff were all injured to different degrees. Luckily, they were still alive.

“Mom, aunt!” Gu Ning ran to them, followed by Tang Yunfan.

Seeing Gu Man in danger, Tang Yunfan’s heart ached for her, and he was extremely worried that Gu Man would die.

Knowing that Tang Yunfan was scared, Gu Ning comforted him. “It’ll be fine.” Gu Ning wasn’t only comforting Tang Yunfan, but also Gu Qing, because Gu Qing kept crying the entire time. Even so, Tang Yunfan was still concerned about Gu Man’s life.

They were in public, so it wasn’t convenient for Gu Ning to put her power into them directly. She then took out the power crystals and told them to take the pills. As for Gu Man who was the most seriously injured, Gu Ning had to save her life as soon as possible.

The other injured people took the pills that Gu Ning gave them without thinking further.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
