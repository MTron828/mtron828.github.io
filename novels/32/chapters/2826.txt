Chapter 2827: Ask Casually

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

They didn’t think a few minutes were enough for them to hide any antiques.

The cashier immediately went upstairs, while those public servants from the Bureau of Cultural Relics sized up the objects in the store. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, there weren’t many real antiques left, only a few objects without high value.

The rest was all crafts.

However, those public servants didn’t think that these were all the goods on sale. Real antiques could be hidden in a warehouse. After all, it wasn’t safe to place real antiques on the shelves in the store.

When they were talking, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting heard them, so Gu Ning and Chen Darong walked out.

As for Leng Shaoting, Gu Ning told him to leave through the window before them, taking the real antiques.

Because Chen Darong was there, Gu Ning couldn’t directly put them away in her telepathic eye space. She had to bother Leng Shaoting to take those real antiques away. After all, she needed to keep her secret.

“Boss, Manager Chen, people from the Bureau of Cultural Relics are here,” the cashier said worriedly.

“It’s fine. We’re done. Let’s go downstairs now,” said Gu Ning. Then they went downstairs together.

The public servants from the Bureau of Cultural Relics met Gu Ning for the first time, but they had seen her photos before, so they recognized her at a glance.

After that, the leader of those public servants said, “Miss Gu, nice to see you. We’re from the Bureau of Cultural Relics. Because of active grave-digging, there are lots of antiques on the market now. We have been ordered to search antique stores. Please cooperate.”

He was very nice. After all, Gu Ning was an important figure, and there was no need for them to offend her.

And if they had a bad attitude, it would seem as if they were deliberately finding fault with Gu Ning.

Although Gu Ning was indeed targeted, they still needed to hide their purpose.

“Since it’s your job, we will definitely be cooperative, but I need to see your documentation,” said Gu Ning.

Whether it was really an order from a senior official or if she actually was the target, she had to see the documents.

“Of course,” said the leader, then gave Gu Ning the search warrant.

Because it was real, they didn’t need to hide.

After reading the search warrant, Gu Ning let them do their job.

Afterwards, they began to search around.

Although the cashier and other employees were still worried, they trusted Gu Ning. Since she agreed to let them do the search, everything should be fine.

Those public servants searched around the hall first, but failed to find a single real antique. There were barely any very valuable antiques.

The leader wondered whether Gu Ning knew they were coming and had already hidden valuable antiques away.

“Miss Gu, I heard that there are a lot of valuable antiques in Xiangyun Antique Store. Why can’t we see any?” asked the leader.

“Because they’ve all been sold. You should know that there are less real antiques on the market lately. I didn’t have many good pieces recently. That’s the reason why we’re selling crafts now,” said Gu Ning.

It wasn’t a secret that Xiangyun Antique Store started to sell crafts, but those public servants didn’t believe that there weren’t real antiques in this store.

There used to be a lot. How come all the real antiques disappeared suddenly?

“You’re right, but since we need to do a search, we must be meticulous. Miss Gu, can you take us to the warehouse or offices? We need to do a thorough search,” said the leader.

“No problem,” said Gu Ning. She had already put away those real antiques, so they wouldn’t be able to find anything.

To avoid unnecessary trouble, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to look around the store after she arrived. She didn’t see any valuable antiques.

She even checked those public servants in case they framed her, but they didn’t carry any antiques with them.

Without surprise, those public servants found nothing valuable even though they searched every corner of Xiangyun Antique Store. At that moment, the leader was annoyed.

“Miss Gu, are you sure this is everything?” he asked.

“Yes, sir, why won’t you believe me?” Gu Ning asked curiously, but she was just feeling him out.

Although she believed that she was the target, she wasn’t sure of it until now.

The man panicked a little, but soon returned to normal. Gu Ning caught his reaction and was sure she was targeted today. However, she showed nothing on her face.

“Miss Gu, no need to think too much about it. I’m just asking,” said the leader. He obviously wouldn’t admit it.

“I didn’t think much about it. I just asked casually,” said Gu Ning with a smile.

“Well, then, I guess we should leave,” the leader said, then he left with his people.

Although Gu Ning was targeted this time, not many people knew the truth. Therefore, they still needed to go to other antique stores to do the same thing. Otherwise their purpose would be exposed.

However, when they went to other antique stores, they didn’t search carefully and just quickly finished their job.

…

Leng Shaoting didn’t leave. He only avoided them when they searched around. Once they were gone, Leng Shaoting came out.

When Leng Shaoting disappeared and appeared out of blue, the cashier and two employees were extremely surprised, but no one dared to ask about it.

“Those antiques are hidden away. Don’t sell them till it’s safe,” said Gu Ning.

“Sure,” said Chen Darong and the others.

After that, Gu Ning left with Leng Shaoting. She watched the group of public servants casually search the other antique stores, so she was convinced that she was the only target.
