2893 Let Them Follow

“Yes.” Leng Shaoting answered in his mother tongue, then directly left.

He spoke in his mother tongue, because his appearance told them where he came from.

Hearing Leng Shaoting’s answer, they were extremely surprised. They couldn’t believe that he could catch sea animals just with his hands and he was even from a foreign country.

“Jesus, that’s amazing! He caught the seafood with his hands.”

“Right, and I can see that the seafood he caught is of good quality. I don’t think they are from the shallow areas.”

“Do you mean he went deep into the ocean? He must have held his breath for a long time!”

“!!”

When Leng Shaoting got back, Gu Ning was watching TV in the living room.

Once Leng Shaoting walked in, Gu Ning ran towards him to see what he caught.

“Wow, these prawns and crabs are so big!” After seeing the prawns and crabs in the net, Gu Ning was surprised.

“The water here is nutritious, so the sea animals grow large. I saw many precious sea animals in the ocean, but you said that you want to catch some this afternoon, so I just caught enough for a single meal,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Yeah, now you can go cook. Boil half the prawns and steam the other half with minced garlic. As for crabs, I want to eat spicy fried crabs. The fish can be steamed simply,” Gu Ning said. She had no intention of doing anything and left all the work to Leng Shaoting.

Anyway, even if she wanted to do it, Leng Shaoting wouldn’t let her.

“No problem, you can wait for a while and watch TV,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Thanks!” Gu Ning smiled, then Leng Shaoting went to cook.

By the time the dishes were almost done, the rice was cooked too, so they could immediately eat.

After having the meal, Leng Shaoting washed all the dishes, while Gu Ning went upstairs to change.

They were by the sea now, so she felt that she should put on a long white dress.

Therefore, Gu Ning wore a fairy-like white dress and tied her hair into a messy but beautiful bun.

It was hot, so it would be uncomfortable if she let her hair down.

When Gu Ning walked downstairs, Leng Shaoting had cleaned everything up. After a glance at Gu Ning, he frowned.

“What?” Gu Ning asked. Wasn’t it pretty on her? She thought it looked beautiful and she didn’t show much skin. Although there were straps, she added a shawl. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“You’re too beautiful. I’m afraid that men won’t be able to keep their eyes off you.” Leng Shaoting pulled Gu Ning into his arms and said in a grumpy tone.

“Ha-ha.” Gu Ning snorted with laughter, then complimented herself. “Um, men can’t keep their eyes off me no matter what I wear, unless I wrap my face up, but that’s too uncomfortable. I don’t want to do that.”

“You’re right. You’re too pretty to be ignored. I don’t want you to wrap your face up either,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Come on, I think you’re more attractive than me. I should be worried, instead of you,” Gu Ning said, pretending to be displeased.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was amused and said, “Do I need to put on a mask and sunglasses?”

Gu Ning was satisfied. “I’m not as jealous as you. Just let them watch. Anyway, they can’t have you.”

“Of course, I only belong to you,” Leng Shaoting said with a smile.

Afterwards, they walked out hand in hand.

At this time, everyone had finished dinner and were having a walk outside, so there were many people on the beach.

Seeing Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting, many people paid special attention to them and complimented them, but because they were a couple, no one dared to strike up a conversation with either of them.

“What do you want to do? Do you want to sail a yacht?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“Why not! We can catch seafood further in the ocean,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure, but give me some time. I need to call my friend to make the arrangements,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Of course,” Gu Ning said.

Leng Shaoting took out his phone and called his friend.

About ten minutes later, a yacht appeared in front of them.

The sailor left the yacht and handed the key to Leng Shaoting before walking away. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting got on and sailed out.

Although they were unfamiliar with the route, it wasn’t a problem for them.

The yacht sped ahead. They didn’t have a destination so they just followed their whims.

There were other yachts there too. In the beginning, no one noticed them, but two yachts followed them as they sailed farther.

Gu Ning slightly frowned and immediately used her Jade Eyes to check who they were.

There were four people on the two yachts, including two men and two women in their twenties.

“Normally, people don’t dare to go farther on an ocean, because they might get lost, but they seem to be willing to take the risk after seeing us,” Leng Shaoting said.

Gu Ning also saw the excitement on their faces, so she agreed with Leng Shaoting.

“We should get rid of them,” Gu Ning said. She didn’t want to be interrupted.

“Sure,” Leng Shaoting said as he sped up.

Although they immediately pulled farther away, the speed was limited and the two yachts weren’t much slower than them, so they were unable to get rid of them.

After all, yachts were basically the same and they were on an ocean instead of a road so there was nothing in their way.

“Fine, just let them follow us, as long as they don’t bother us.” Since they couldn’t get rid of the two yachts, they gave up. Anyway, the ocean wasn’t owned by them, so they couldn’t stop other people from sailing around.

Because Gu Ning gave up the idea of getting rid of the two yachts, the two yachts quickly caught up to them.

When one yacht was only three meters away from them, the man who was sailing it shouted at them, “Hey, why did you go so far? Aren’t you scared?”

He spoke in Language Y.

He didn’t come to cause trouble, so Gu Ning replied, “There is nothing to be afraid of.”

When Gu Ning turned around to look at them, the men were stunned. What a beautiful girl!

On the other hand, the girls showed jealousy, but the boys had no bad intentions. In fact, they should be couples.

No matter how much they liked beautiful women, the boys didn’t want to annoy their girlfriends.

The two men on the other yacht might have a different idea, but they hadn’t had a chance to see Gu Ning’s face yet.
