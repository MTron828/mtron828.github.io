Chapter 550 The Spokesperson of Jade Beauty Jewelry

“Thanks, Mr. Quan. I’ll call you once I finish my work here,” Gu Ning said. She did need the support of Tanghuang Group concerning publicity.

“You don’t need to call me Mr. Quan. We’re not strangers after all, so you can directly call me Uncle Quan,” Quan Mingkai said. Although he had just met Gu Ning a few times, Gu Ning was already a member of the Tang Family anyway.

“Uncle Quan,” Gu Ning called him. “Please don’t me Miss Gu anymore, and you can directly call my full name.”

“Sure, Gu Ning,” Quan Mingkai said. Quan Mingkai still had something else to deal with, so he left later.

All of a sudden, Gu Ning had a very busy schedule in the following days.

The jewelry store in City B was about to open within a week, and the opening ceremony would be held in the Huangdeng Hotel, which was super easy for her to settle. However, she had to go back to City G in person before that. They needed to deliver a large amount of jade jewelry, and it wouldn’t be safe enough if Zhou Zhenghong did that job all on his own. In addition, she had to set up a processing plant in City B so that she wouldn’t need to deliver jade jewelry from City G in the future.

After the meal, she also needed to check the gowns for the opening ceremony. Although she trusted Yu Zi, she had to check them in person too.

As for the models, she could hire some from the entertainment company under the name of Tanghuang Group. For now, Gu Ning hadn’t made the final decision as to the spokesperson of Jade Beauty Jewelry, because it was very important and the spokesperson would endorse her brand for at least a whole year. Therefore, Gu Ning’s first choice was Su Tongnuo because Su Tongnuo worked for her and she knew that Su Tongnuo was a professional actress with a good reputation.

Maybe Su Tongnuo wasn’t very famous in the eyes of the public, and she didn’t have a strong influence, but Gu Ning wasn’t worried at all. Since Su Tongnuo worked for her, she would make her popular. Moreover, Su Tongnuo was also a potential A-list actress, so Gu Ning was confident that she would be a great choice.

As long as the advertisement was released, Su Tongnuo could soon be a household name with the help of K.

Other than that, Gu Ning also needed to go fetch Chu Peihan and the others in City D as well, because their parts in the film were almost over.

The drugs and skincare products were also done in the factory of Colaine Pharmaceutical Company, and they would be tested in a few days. After the test, they could come onto the market. However, Ning Changkai’s business enemies would stop him from passing the test without a doubt, so Gu Ning had to go to the capital in a few days.

Chen Cangyi’s legs were fully recovered too, and he was able to work now so Gu Ning had to make some arrangements for him.

“Ningning, who will you choose to be the spokesperson of your jewelry brand?” Cao Wenxin asked with curiosity.

“Su Tongnuo,” Gu Ning said.

“What?” Cao Wenxin was surprised. “Don’t you think that her influence isn’t strong enough? Why don’t you use an A-list celebrity?”

Although Su Tongnuo was a friend of Cao Wenxin’s friend, it was undeniable that Su Tongnuo wasn’t famous enough to be the spokesperson of a well-known luxurious jewelry brand.

Hearing their talk, Tang Haifeng added, “I think Wenxin is right. There are a few actors working for an entertainment company which is controlled by our family. I think you can choose the spokesperson from them.”

Gu Ning wore a grateful smile. “Thank you for your advice grandpa, but I still want to give this chance to the actress who works for my entertainment company.”

If she wasn’t going to do that, the actresses who worked for her would never have a chance to be popular.

“What? The actress works for you? You’re involved in the entertainment industry?” Tang Haifeng was astonished.

“Yes,” Gu Ning said, but didn’t explain the reason.

Tang Haifeng wanted to say something, but didn’t know what to say. In fact, what could he say now? Gu Ning became a billionaire at such a young age all on her own, and had proved that she was able to run her business very well. Therefore, Tang Haifeng didn’t have the right to stop Gu Ning from building her business empire.

It was just a beginning as well, because Gu Ning had just started up her business, and she wasn’t a major competitor in the industries that she was involved in yet. Once she became a strong competitor, and began to grab resources from her peers, she would be in a fierce war in business.

“Girl Gu, if you need anything, feel free to tell me, alright?” Tang Haifeng said. He was more than willing to support his lovely granddaughter.

“Sure, grandpa,” Gu Ning said.

In politics, you might achieve something all on your own but it didn’t work like that in business. No matter how smart or skillful you were, you still needed to closely cooperate with others. Without a powerful network, it was impossible to be successful in business.

Gu Man talked to Tang Yunfan for another two hours, but Tang Yunfan still had no reaction, which worried everyone.

After lunch, Gu Ning had to leave the Tang Family’s house, but she was worried that Gu Man would feel uneasy staying alone here. However, Gu Man told her that everyone in the Tang Family were easy-going, and Gu Man was accustomed to the new environment.

Gu Ning went out to deal with some business as well as some personal affairs, so she couldn’t bring Cao Wenxin with her. Although Cao Wenxin complained about it, she didn’t insist.

Once Gu Ning drove away from the Tang Family’s house, she called Yu Zi. She planned to check on the gowns first. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Yu Zi was in her shop, so Gu Ning would go to her shop to meet her after she met Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting was sharing the meal with He Qiming in the hotel, so Gu Ning directly went to the hotel to pick him up.

Although there were many luxurious cars stopped outside of the hotel, Gu Ning’s limited edition Lamborghini was still very noticeable. Once she stopped it outside of the hotel, it attracted a lot of attention from people around it.

“Wow, isn’t that the latest model of Lamborghini? There are only 40 of them around the world!”

“Indeed! It looks so cool!”
