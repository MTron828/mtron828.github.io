Chapter 2181: The Door of the Store Is Damaged

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

If Jing Yunyao didn’t tell them, they could understand it, but it was unacceptable that Jing Yunyao lied to them. Therefore, a flower shop owner couldn’t stand it and went to argue with Jing Yunyao.

“Boss Shen, if you don’t want to tell us where you get the plants in a large quantity, we won’t have any complaints, but if you’re willing to tell us, why did you lie to us? It’s really unkind. We’ll be neighbors in the future. You seriously shouldn’t do that!” The man accused Jing Yunyao.

Jing Yunyao wasn’t angry at all when she was accused. Instead, she replied politely. “Sir, I promise I did get the plants in a large quantity from that place. I also have the receipt here! But after I purchased the plants from there, I raised them in my own manor for a few days. Maybe the soil and water in my manor are good, so the plants in my store are different from other plants!”

“Well…”

Hearing that, the flower shop owner still had doubts, but he said nothing further after Jing Yunyao’s explanation.

If he kept on criticizing her, it would be his fault, so he left looking upset. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Gu Ning and the others didn’t take it to heart, so they didn’t bother to punish the flower shop owner.

In the afternoon, Gu Ning told her good friends about the opening of the Pavilion of Magic tomorrow morning at 10 am. Because tomorrow was Tuesday and Chu Peihan and the others needed to have classes, she didn’t tell them in case they were absent from school.

Therefore, Gu Ning only shared the news with Zi Beiying, Xu Qinyin, Gu Anna, and Leng Shaoxi.

She didn’t force them to come and it depended on whether they had time. After all, exceptr for Zi Beiying, they all needed to work.

Jing Yunyao also sent an invitation to Yu Yin, Elder Mrs. Xu, and Yan Min in person. They were her only familiar people in the capital. After all, she had a special identity, and it wasn’t appropriate for her to be involved in their circle. She didn’t want to know too many people either.

After the flower shop was opened, it would be enough for her to make friends with some ordinary customers.

The flower trading center usually closed at 7 or 8 pm, so on the first day, they left at 7:30 pm. After leaving, they went directly to a nearby restaurant for dinner.

They didn’t go back until they finished the meal.

This time, Jing Yunyao and Miao Jingjing didn’t go to the siheyuan, they went to Mountain River Garden. Because they were two women, and it was inconvenient for them to stay in the siheyuan all the time.

Jing Yunyao had only stayed in the siheyuan for a long time before because she wasn’t in good health back then.

Miao Jingjing stayed with Jing Yunyao for the time being. She didn’t have any savings, so she wasn’t able to live alone. Their house at Mountain River Garden was very large and Jing Yunyao lived alone, so they could live together as friends.

Gu Ning also stayed in Mountain River Garden that night.

The next day, because Gu Ning needed to go back to school after the opening today, she wouldn’t be able to drive Jing Yunyao and Miao Jingjing home. Therefore, Jing Yunyao drove to the store.

Leng Shaoting had prepared a car for Jing Yunyao, but she normally didn’t need to use it. However, as of today, she might drive every day.

Gu Ning and the others arrived at the Pavilion of Magic at 8:30 am. However, when they had almost reached the Pavilion of Magic, they saw many onlookers standing at its door. Gu Ning and the others immediately realized that something was wrong, so they directly ran there.

At the door of Pavilion of Magic, they saw it was splashed with paint, and several pits were left on it. Many eggs had been thrown on the door sign as well.

In an instant, Gu Ning and the others were angry. Who did that?

The first idea that came to Gu Ning and the others was that it must be done by those people who came to ask Jing Yunyao where they got the plants in a large quantity yesterday, or one of them.

As for their motive, they must have believed that they had deceived them.

Although Jing Yunyao had explained yesterday that she had raised the plants in her own manor for a while, they might not be convinced.

Some of them could be convinced, so Gu Ning and the others were suspicious of them as well as other peers.

Although other peers didn’t come to ask them, it didn’t mean that they had no motives. As long as they were jealous of the Pavilion of Magic, they could have motives.

Gu Ning and the others didn’t forget a person, Jiang Dajun.

Although Gu Ning had told those men to warn him, he might not listen.

No matter who did it, Gu Ning was determined to get to the bottom of it, or others might think they were weak and easy to bully!

They weren’t easy to bully at all and even held grudges longer than ordinary people. Therefore, if anyone dared to mess with them, they would pay their enemies back.

Onlookers stepped away once they saw Gu Ning and the others coming, in case they mistook them for the guilty.

“Um, when we came, your store was already like this. It has nothing to do with us.” The owner of the flower shop next to Pavilion of Magic explained right away.

He was the one who asked Jing Yunyao where they bought their plants yesterday and came back to accuse Jing Yunyao for being unkind yesterday.

Because of what he had done yesterday, he knew he would be the first suspect.

They were mad at what had happened yesterday, but Jing Yunyao had done nothing wrong, so they wouldn’t damage her store.

Besides, they had all witnessed their fighting skills. They were so strong and none of them dared to mess with them.

“Right, it was already like this when we came.”

“You better call the police now.”

“There are surveillance cameras. You can check the videos to see who has done it.”

“Right.”

“…”

Those people who had also asked Jing Yunyao where she bought the plants kept on giving her advice in order to prove that they had nothing to do with the damage.

Hearing their explanation, Gu Ning and the others believed they were innocent.

Anyway, what they needed to do right now was to tidy it up and they could do the investigation later.

“Alright, you can leave now. I’ll catch the mastermind,” said Gu Ning. She was furious, but she didn’t show it on her face.

Hearing that, they all left.

“We only have slightly more than an hour. Let’s tidy it up now,” said Gu Ning. She would go to check the surveillance videos, but she had no intention of calling the police, because it was troublesome.

The police would only hold the criminals in detention for a few days and tell them to pay some money.

Gu Ning didn’t lack money, so she would rather find the criminals by herself.. She would teach them an unforgettable lesson and let them pay more to treat their injuries than it would cost to fix the door of the store.
