Chapter 1503: Just Hang out for a While

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Actually, if the Mu family didn’t have any dirty secrets, K wouldn’t be able to ruin it within such a short time.

Mu Xuxin was sick, lying on the patient bed now, and could do nothing to save his family.

Although the Mu family went bankrupt, it didn’t have many debts, so K still had mercy.

Gu Ning gave a glance to Wu Shunhua after she walked into her office, and she noticed that Dongfang Ziyu was absent.

After that, she went on dealing with her own business.

...

When Dongfang Ziyu reached the boundary between the cultivation world and the mortals’ world, she ran into Baili Zongxue who just walked out.

“Hi, Ziyue, are you going home?” Baili Zongxue smiled at Dongfang Ziyu.

Although the four dominant families were actually competitors, they still remained kind to one another on the surface.

The Dongfang family and the Baili family also had the intention to form a marriage alliance and let Baili Zongyang marry Dongfang Ziyu. Baili Zongyang agreed, because Dongfang Ziyu was indeed beautiful and the most skilled female cultivator in the cultivation world.

Dongfang Ziyu, however, was unwilling to marry him. She made an excuse saying that it was still too early to talk about that now and avoided Baili Zongyang all the time.

Baili Zongyang was a very outstanding young man, but she still couldn’t fall in love with him. To be specific, Dongfang Ziyu even hated Baili Zongyang a little.

As for Baili Zongxue, Dongfang Ziyu stayed polite to her.

“Yeah, where are you going?” Dongfang Ziyu asked.

“Just hanging out for a while,” Baili Zongxue said.

“The kung fu competition is about to come. Why don’t you spend more time on your cultivation?” Dongfang Ziyu asked, like she was educating her own younger sister.

Hearing that, Baili Zongxue looked aggrieved. “I can’t make the top three anyway, and it won’t change anything even if I practiced my cultivation very hard.”

Baili Zongxue got along well with Dongfang Ziyu, but it didn’t mean that she would say anything to her. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Where do you live right now?” Dongfang Ziyu asked.

“My older brother booked a room in a hotel for me, and he’ll tell me when I go to meet him,” Baili Zongxue said, and didn’t mention Century City at all.

In that case, Dongfang Ziyu understood that Baili Zongxue was determined to hide the secret from her. She was very sure that Baili Zongxue went to the mortals’ world because of Gu Ning.

“Alright, see you!” Dongfang Ziyu said.

“Bye-bye,” Baili Zongxue said and walked away.

Dongfang Ziyu, however, stopped at the boundary and took out her phone to send Wu Shunhua a message and told him that she just ran into Baili Zongxue.

...

Tang Yaxin and Ji Yijing didn’t sleep at all that night, and looked super haggard. Even though there was a mercenary by their sides, they were still afraid. They knew that mercenaries were very strong and much better than common bodyguards, but they kept having nightmares once they closed their eyes.

Ji Yijing was in a better mental condition than Tang Yaxin, because she was knocked unconscious when Tang Yaxin was being tortured by “Tang Aining”.

From that night, Tang Yaxin couldn’t relax at all.

Qi Ziyue thought about drugs for a whole morning before he finally turned on his phone.

Over a hundred messages and dozens of missed calls flooded into his phone and they all came from his friends. Qi Ziyue ignored them and directly called a person.

He called his friend who had been addicted to drugs and successfully got rid of them later. He knew where to buy drugs.

Qi Ziyue didn’t know how to explain his current situation to his friend, but he was left no choice now.

At the same time, he was also worried that his friend might tell the Tang family about his condition. He wasn’t sure whether his friend was still reliable after the shocking scandal erupted. He didn’t have close friends after all, and he had to be very careful.

After waiting for a few seconds, his friend picked up his call. “Ziyue, how are you doing now?”

Actually, he had tried to find Qi Ziyue when he disappeared all of a sudden, but nobody answered his calls. Qi Ziyue’s phone was always turned off. Although they weren’t close friends, they were friends after all.

“Wang Ge, I need your help,” Qi Ziyue said.

“What can I do for you?” Wang Ge said. “I’m willing to help, but my ability is limited, and I hope you can understand it.”

Qi Ziyue wasn’t displeased at all and said, “Well, the thing is...”

He then told Wang Ge everything, and begged him to help him get drugs.
