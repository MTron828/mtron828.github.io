Chapter 3474 ¬†Ji Yang Is Expelled from Dragon Bone City

The people on Ji Yang's side also sensed it and woke up one after another to see what was going on.

When they saw that it was something happening to Lu Chengfeng, they ran over to see him. Upon seeing that Lu Chengfeng was actually forming his core, they got jealous at once.

Especially Ji Yang. He had an impulse to destroy everything.

He had always been jealous of Lu Chengfeng because his cultivation level was higher than his own. As soon as he joined the Long family, he received attention, so he had always been ostracizing Lu Chengfeng.

Now that Lu Chengfeng was about to form his core, as long as he succeeded, his position in the Long family would rise because there were only twenty or so golden core cultivators in the entire Long family.

The more Ji Yang thought about it, the more jealous he became, and his rationality began to disappear bit by bit.

Finally, Ji Yang rushed towards Lu Chengfeng.

However, before he could get close to Lu Chengfeng, he was struck by a powerful magical force from Leng Xiaoyao's hand. He was directly knocked back more than ten meters, then fell to the ground, spitting out a mouthful of blood.

"Brother Yang‚Ä¶"

Everyone immediately ran over to check on him, but no one blamed Leng Xiaoyao for what she did.

They never expected that Ji Yang would try to interrupt Lu Chengfeng's core formation, and they strongly disagreed with such behavior.

Interrupting someone's breakthrough was simply despicable, so it wasn't wrong for Leng Xiaoyao to knock Ji Yang away.

"This person is too despicable." Nan Weiyue also felt very angry, not for Lu Chengfeng, but because of this kind of behavior. It was very infuriating.

After being knocked away by Leng Xiaoyao, Ji Yang suddenly became sober, but he didn't feel guilty about his previous actions because he really wanted to interrupt Lu Chengfeng's core formation, whether he was rational or irrational.

However, at this moment, he couldn't make a move.

Lu Chengfeng's body began to swell violently, and a tiny crack appeared in his energy center.

At this moment, every bone in his body felt like it was being stimulated by warm currents. It hurt and itched, but it was also comfortable.

In his energy center, energy gathered little by little, and white lines kept moving around inside his body. He looked inside his body and saw everything about himself.

Finally, golden light flickered and his energy center stopped fluctuating.

A round bead that was flesh color, but emitting golden light floated up and down inside his body.

It was a successful core formation!

Suddenly, the sky turned dark.

Although it was already dark outside, the moon was still bright. So when a dark cloud covered the moonlight, it became even darker.

They all had to leave Lu Chengfeng's side as soon as possible, otherwise they would be mistaken for helping with the heavenly tribulation and make it even more powerful.

"Everyone retreat." Leng Xiaoyao shouted. No one dared to stay so they ran away until they were forty or fifty meters away from Lu Chengfeng before stopping. F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

As soon as they left the area of the heavenly tribulation, a thunderous sound rang in their ears.

The heavenly tribulation attracted the attention of many people in Dragon Bone City. The Long family sent people over to see if it was their disciples.

After completing the heavenly tribulation, Lu Chengfeng appeared in front of everyone with a black face and ragged clothes. It amused Leng Xiaoyao.

Luckily, even though his clothes were ragged, they still covered him. Otherwise, it would have been embarrassing.

Before Lu Chengfeng could change his clothes, people from the Long family arrived.

The city gate of the Dragon Bone City was only for outsiders. As long as they were allowed by the Long family's patriarch or elder-level figures, they could come and go at any time.

The person who came was the steward of the Long family. When he saw that it was Lu Chengfeng, he was very happy. "Lu Chengfeng, it's you! Wonderful!"

Lu Chengfeng had excellent talent for cultivation and was already favored by the Long family. Now that he had formed his core, he would be even more favored.

"Thank you, steward," Lu Chengfeng said. He was also very happy that he had finally formed his core. It was all thanks to Leng Xiaoyao's help! Otherwise, he would have been interrupted by Ji Yang.

Interrupting someone's breakthrough was very dangerous, so he hated Ji Yang more than ever.

Ji Yang was very worried when he saw the steward. If the steward knew that he had tried to interrupt Lu Chengfeng's breakthrough, he would definitely report it to the patriarch and kick him out.

The Long family had a rule that disciples couldn't harm one another.

However, what he worried about most still happened. It wasn't Lu Chengfeng who reported it, but Cheng Zi. "Steward, just now Ji Yang directly intervened and tried to interrupt Lu Chengfeng's breakthrough. If it hadn't been for Taoist Friend Leng who stopped him, Lu Chengfeng would have been in great danger."

Although Lu Chengfeng hesitated to say it, Cheng Zi revealed it, and he didn't stop him. After all, what Ji Yang did was indeed unforgivable.

"What?" The steward was shocked. He immediately looked at Ji Yang with a sharp gaze, which frightened Ji Yang and sent a chill down his spine.

Because everyone had witnessed it, Ji Yang couldn't deny it.

However, he was also terrified, so he immediately pleaded. "Steward, I was wrong. I lost control of myself and attacked Lu Chengfeng. I now realize my mistake and sincerely ask for a chance to change."

Being able to become a disciple of the Long family was an honor for his entire family. If he were expelled from the Long family, he would surely become a laughingstock.

Only at this moment did he truly regret it.

"Ji Yang, who do you think you are? Do you think a simple apology can absolve your mistakes? If everyone acted like you, who would follow the rules of the Long family? Considering that Lu Chengfeng is unharmed, you will only be expelled from Dragon Bone City, but if something really happened to Lu Chengfeng, the consequences wouldn't be so simple," the steward said sternly.

"Steward‚Ä¶" Ji Yang wanted to plead further, but he knew that it was useless at this point.

The others who used to be with Ji Yang distanced themselves from him when they saw him being criticized by the steward. They were afraid of being dragged into trouble by Ji Yang.

Ji Yang was deeply disappointed.

He had done something wrong, but he had never harmed them. On the contrary, he often protected them. However, now that he was in trouble, they immediately turned their backs on him.

He didn't need them to plead for him, but at least show some concern!

Leng Xiaoyao and the others saw their behavior and looked down on them.

Because of that, when they tried to please Lu Chengfeng later on, he didn't get close to them and only maintained a polite relationship as disciples.

The steward no longer paid attention to Ji Yang, but turned to Leng Xiaoyao. He didn't ignore what Cheng Zi had said. If it hadn't for Leng Xiaoyao, Lu Chengfeng would have fallen into Ji Yang's hands.

"May I know how to address you?" the steward asked politely.

Although the steward held a high position, he wasn't an arrogant person.

It could be said that he treated people according to what they did.

Lu Chengfeng owed Leng Xiaoyao a big favor. He was also a disciple of the Long family. Therefore, the steward should treat her with courtesy.
