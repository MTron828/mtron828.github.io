Chapter 1314: More Expensive than Gold

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

However, Tang Haifeng looked sad all of a sudden and sighed, “Well, I just wish we had found them earlier so that they wouldn’t have suffered so much in the past years.”

Even though they lived a good life now, he still felt guilty upon thinking what Gu Ning had been through before. It wasn’t something he could control, but he still felt guilty. He cared about Gu Ning, so he felt for her.

“Grandpa, you don’t need to feel guilty. I think it’s fate that brought us together. If I had grown up in the Tang family, I probably would have become a useless spoiled rich kid and wouldn’t have achieved what I have today. Without being through a lot, I couldn’t have learned to be strong and brave,” Gu Ning immediately said to comfort Tang Haifeng.

Actually, if Gu Ning hadn’t suffered a lot, Tang Aining wouldn’t have been reborn. If Tang Aining hadn’t been reborn, she wouldn’t have met Leng Shaoting. If all the above never had happened, Gu Ning wouldn’t have met the Tang family and would have to live a terrible life with Gu Man as usual. Gu Ning might have fallen in a vegetative state because of the car accident, and Gu Man would have to pay a highly expensive medical fee by herself.

“Ningning’s right. No matter what kind of life a person is living, there could be chances and twists of fate. It is what it is, and we should focus on our future,” Master Leng said.

“Right, we need to pay more attention to our happy life now and the future.” Tang Haifeng was cheered up.

Afterwards, they began to chat with each other about something pleasant.

Although the Tang family was unwilling to see Gu Ning, who just became a part of them, soon marry into another family, they respected Gu Ning’s own desires. As long as she wanted it, the Tang family would be supportive.

Moreover, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were only going to be engaged right now. And even if Gu Ning married Leng Shaoting, she would still be a member of the Tang family, which could never be changed.

Because it was a sure bet that Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting would get married one day in the future, the two families directly talked about their engagement date today. However, it wasn’t up to them to pick a random date. They needed to carefully choose the right time.

“I think one of my old friends can help us settle the date. He’s a famous professor, Zhao Yiru, and he’s an expert of xuanxue [1. Xuanxue is a metaphysical post-classical Chinese philosophy from the Six Dynasties (222-589), bringing together Daoist and Confucian beliefs through revision and discussion.],” Tang Haifeng said.

Neither Master Leng nor Master Tang knew much about the date of birth and eight characters of a horoscope, so Tang Haifeng thought of Zhao Yiru.

“Great!” Master Leng agreed with happiness.

During this time, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went outside for a while. When they came back, they carried a big sack with something moving inside. It was obviously something alive.

The second they walked inside, they scared everyone in the living hall.

“Ningning, what are you carrying in the sack? Did you just kidnap someone?” Tang Haifeng asked.

Gu Ning was amused. “Of course not, grandpa. There is a fish inside.”

“A fish? Where did you get this big fish?” Master Leng asked.

“I found it in the sea when I was in XH the other day. Because this fish is really rare, I planned to eat it when we were all together so I kept it somewhere else. I just arranged for someone to deliver it,” Gu Ning lied. She couldn’t tell them that she had a telepathic eye space and kept the fish in it the entire time.

Leng Shaoting was aware of it, but Gu Ning had no intention to let more people know about it.

“Really? What kind of fish is it?” Everyone got curious and moved over to have a look at the fish.

Leng Shaoting put the fish down and opened the sack. The giant yellow croaker was shown before them.

“What is this fish?” Many people couldn’t recognize what kind of fish it was.

However, Master Leng and Master Tang were shocked when they saw the fish. “This is a giant yellow croaker!”

“Giant yellow croaker?”

Although many of them still didn’t know what a giant yellow croaker was, they knew that it couldn’t be ordinary after seeing Master Leng’s and Master Tang’s reaction.

“This fish is very rare, and it’s even more expensive than gold!” Tang Haifeng exclaimed. He had read about it in a book, but had never seen it before.

“Right, it’s super expensive!” Master Leng said.

“How expensive is it?” Tang Jiakai asked.

Gu Ning then explained. “The giant yellow croaker is a critically endangered species of marine and brackish water fish in the family Sciaenidae. There once was a giant yellow croaker which weighed 48 kg, and someone paid six hundred thousand yuan for it. This giant yellow croaker I caught is at least 70 kg, so it should be worth over a million yuan.”

Hearing that, everyone was shocked again. A single piece of fish was worth over a million yuan! This could be the most expensive dish they had ever eaten.

“Ningning, I can’t believe that you could get the most expensive fish in the world!” Cao Wenxin said.

The others began to compliment Gu Ning as well.

Actually, Gu Ning relied on her telepathic eye space to catch and keep this giant yellow croaker. Nevertheless, she had to keep it a secret.

“How should we cook it?” Tang Yunfan asked.

“We can let the cook do it in every way he knows,” Gu Ning said.

“We can’t eat all of it,” Master Leng said.

“It’s fine. We must eat it when it’s fresh,” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning was right, so the others agreed.

When the cook came over and saw the giant yellow croaker, he was greatly surprised too.
