Chapter 120: Competition with Chen Meng

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I think you’re pretty good at fighting. Well, would you mind if we had a competition?” Although Chen Meng felt that it was slightly impolite, he attempted to give it a try.

Chen Meng was a grow-up man, while Gu Ning was a teenage girl. It seemed unfair, but he was really curious about Gu Ning’s ability. However, Gu Ning was excited about his invitation. She actually wanted to practice!

Chen Meng served in the military. He wasn’t an ordinary soldier either. If Gu Ning wanted to practice, he would be an excellent choice. Therefore, the minute Chen Meng invited her, Gu Ning answered, “Sure! I had the same idea.”

Then, both of them went to a broad square to compete with each other.

In the beginning, neither of them used their full force, not out of disrespect, but because they didn’t want to show their real strength right away. They would adjust themselves according to the other’s ability. In addition, they didn’t plan to defeat the other. One wanted to practice, while the other wanted to have a try.

Thus it was even at the beginning. However, Gu Ning’s movements shocked Chen Meng, because she moved so professionally and strongly. She must have received years of professional training.

After a while, both of them became more aggressive, but it was still even.

Chen Meng was gradually astonished. Gu Ning was almost as strong as a middle-level soldier in the special forces.

The competition continued. They once again used more strength to compete with each other. Although it looked even, they knew that they were both losing energy. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Gu Ning wasn’t surprised at Chen Meng’s ability, because he was a military officer, but Chen Meng was totally astonished by Gu Ning. It was so unbelievable!

He had trained for over 10 years to be so powerful, but an 18-year-old girl was able to do the same thing as him!

Chen Meng knew that if the competition went on, he was likely to lose, which was shameful. Thus he gave Gu Ning a hint to stop.

Gu Ning also had no idea how long she could continue. She wasn’t sure she would win either. She wanted to test her real ability, so she didn’t use her power to assist her.

“Wow, it is so unbelievable! Are you sure you’re only 18?” Chen Meng seemed disappointed, but he also admired Gu Ning.

“I used my full strength already. I couldn’t continue either,” Gu Ning said. She was being modest. Chen Meng of course knew that Gu Ning didn’t want to be proud. She helped him to save face too. He had a growing interest in Gu Ning now, but not as a man to a woman. There was an over 10 year age gap between them after all.

“Can I invite you to have breakfast together?” Chen Meng asked with sincerity.

“Of course!” Gu Ning accepted.

The two walked towards the outside of this living area.

“Are you studying in a high school now?” Chen Meng asked.

“Yes, I’m a senior in City F,” Gu Ning replied.

“A senior. Then you’re going to attend the National College Entrance Exam in half a year. Which university is your favorite?” Chen Meng added.

“The Capital University,” Gu Ning said.

“The Capital University!” Chen Meng was a little surprised. He looked at Gu Ning with his eyes full of respect. “Wow, it’s the number one university in our country. You must be very academic!”

“I don’t know whether I can get in or not. It’s just my aim,” Gu Ning said. She was being modest again.

“I believe you can make it,” Chen Meng encouraged her.

The two had breakfast, then went back home together. They coincidentally found out that they lived in the same building! However, Chen Meng’s apartment was on the twelfth floor, while Gu Ning’s was on the eighth floor.

Chen Meng had a great impression of Gu Ning when she had helped them control those two criminals last time. He would love to make a friend with her. Therefore, Chen Meng asked to exchange their numbers on his own initiative. If Gu Ning had any problems in City G, he could help.

Although he didn’t stay in City G often, he had his network here, especially in the police and the military.

Gu Ning was more than willing to know Chen Meng. A network was built from good impressions, wasn’t it?

Gu Ning went back to her home to take a bath. Meanwhile, Chen Meng immediately called Leng Shaoting, and told him everything.

He had no idea about what was going on between Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning. He was simply excited. Leng Shaoting had also met Gu Ning before after all, so it made sense to talk to him.

“What’s up?” Leng Shaoting said airily.

“Boss, you can’t imagine who I’ve just met! I met the girl who had beaten down those two drug dealers last time in the restaurant while I was running this morning. We had a competition. She is so good! I wasn’t even able to beat her. Ah, it’s so disappointing!” Chen Meng said.

Leng Shaoting was struck dumb when he heard about Gu Ning. She was in City G?

Chen Meng couldn’t beat Gu Ning? Leng Shaoting was shocked.

He clearly knew about Chen Meng’s ability. Chen Meng was a teammate in his Red Flame team. If Gu Ning had equal ability as Chen Meng, she must be very skilful and powerful.

“You can’t even beat a young girl. Don’t you think you need to practice and train more?” Leng Shaoting said coldly.

Hearing that, Chen Meng was nervous. He immediately regretted telling Leng Shaoting. He felt like he was trapped. He couldn’t beat a young girl, which meant he lost.

“Um, well, I need to deal with something right now, bye.” Chen Meng hung up at once, and took a long breath in. However, he knew he couldn’t escape from the training ahead. Whatever, he also planned to train more when he got back to his team. It was still embarrassing that he couldn’t beat a girl.

...

After the bath, Gu Ning was watching TV in her apartment. When it was almost 10 pm, Zhou Zhenghong called her. He had already booked a private room. Its number was 888.

Gu Ning then immediately called Master Yan and Master Fu. The time was settled at 11 am in No. 888 private room in Huangdeng Hotel.

Gu Ning as the host should be there earlier, so she left her home at a little past 10 am.

When she arrived at the private room, it was 10:40 am. Zhou Zhenghong was already waiting for her in the room.

Ten minutes later, Master Fu and Master Yan came in along with Master Bai.

Zhou Zhenghong had no idea who the guests would be. Thus he was so shocked and jumped up from his chair, when Master Fu, Master Yan and Master Bai walked in.

“Grandpa Fu, grandpa Yan, grandpa Bai, it’s so nice to meet you all!” Gu Ning immediately stepped ahead and greeted them.

“Ha-ha, I hope we arrived on time!” Master Fu said.
