Chapter 3042 - 3042 Lose Everything

3042 Lose Everything

Leng Xiaoyao did that with her phone, but hid her phone number using her hacking skills. She also deleted the record. Even if Song Xiuyan’s wife wanted to find out who she was, it was impossible for her to find any clues.

A few minutes later, Song Xiuyan’s wife read the messages and instantly became furious.

No woman could stand her husband betraying her, unless they were in an open relationship. Song Xiuyan’s wife couldn’t accept it either.

Without delay, she turned to her two older brothers for help, and they went to Xi Keyi’s apartment at once.

!!

Without surprise, they caught Song Xiuyan in Xi Keyi’s apartment. His two brothers-in-law beat him heavily. His wife also beat Xi Keyi.

Both Song Xiuyan and Xi Keyi were struck dumb. They couldn’t believe that Song Xiuyan’s wife found them and even came over. They thought they hid their affair very well!

Given what Song Xiuyan had done, his wife was determined to divorce him. In fact, Song Xiuyan got his current job through his connection with his brother-in-law, so his career would be ruined after they divorced.

The next morning, Song Xiuyan received a call from the company and was told that he was fired.

Xi Keyi also lost her job.

The news that Song Xiuyan and Xi Keyi were caught immediately became a hot topic on the entertainment news. After all, Xi Keyi had some fame, so she gained a lot of attention after the news spread.

Song Xiuyan’s wife intended to ruin them, so she paid an Internet Water Army to make the news popular.

Because Song Xiuyan and Xi Keyi were manager and subordinate, their affair aroused a lot of criticism.

Leng Yecheng read the news right away, because Leng Xiaoyao told him about it before going to school that morning. “Perhaps their affair will be exposed this morning. During my investigation, I learned that Song Xiuyan’s wife isn’t weak. She will definitely ruin their careers and reputation. There is no need for us to get involved.”

Knowing that Song Xiuyan’s wife would ruin them, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t bother to get involved. She only wanted them to lose everything.

When Leng Yecheng read the news, he had mixed emotions and felt sad.

A few people knew that Xi Keyi was Leng Yecheng’s girlfriend, so they immediately called him after they read the news.

The first person who called Leng Yecheng was Chen Yuxi.

Because both of them were patients, they were in the hospital at the same time. They were bored and played on the phone most of the time, so they quickly noticed the news.

After reading the news, Chen Yuxi left his ward and went to Leng Yecheng’s.

He was able to get out of the bed now, but he still needed support when he walked.

Therefore, Chen Yuxi asked his mother to help him get to Leng Yecheng’s ward, then asked her to return to his ward since he needed to have a private talk with Leng Yecheng.

Chen Yuxi saw that Leng Yecheng was in a bad mood, but wasn’t sure whether Leng Yecheng had read the news about Xi Keyi yet. If Leng Yecheng didn’t know about it, he shouldn’t be so upset, but if he knew, he wouldn’t be so calm.

When Leng Yecheng saw Chen Yuxi hurriedly coming over, he knew the reason, so he directly spoke after Chen Yuxi’s mother was out. “I found out about it yesterday. It was Yaoyao who told me. And she took the video and sent it to Song Xiuyan’s wife.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Hearing that, Chen Yuxi was astonished. He didn’t expect it to have been done by Leng Xiaoyao, but he appreciated Leng Xiaoyao for doing that and admired her more than before.

He was curious about how Leng Xiaoyao did it, but he knew it wasn’t the right time, so he asked nothing.

Even though Leng Yecheng would be hurt if it was exposed, he would only hurt more deeply if it was left a secret. After all, it was better to deal with painful things quickly.

“Um, I know no one likes this, but it’s a good thing that you found it out earlier,” Chen Yuxi said. He didn’t want to comfort Leng Yecheng with meaningless words. Talk was cheap. Only Leng Yecheng knew how it felt when one was betrayed.

Chen Yuxi also understood that Leng Yecheng had his own principles, so he would get over it after a while.

“Sure. You can go back and rest. I’m fine. I just need some time alone,” Leng Yecheng said. He had his own principles, but he still needed time to get over it.

“Great.” Chen Yuxi didn’t bother Leng Yecheng any longer, and walked out.

After the news went out, Song Xiuyan hid in his own apartment outside, while Xi Keyi didn’t dare to go anywhere. She also hid in her apartment.

The moment Xi Keyi’s family heard the news, they called her and seriously criticized her. It was a shame that they had such an amoral daughter.

After that, many friends called Xi Keyi too, but Xi Keyi directly turned off her phone. She knew none of them really cared about her.

It was true. They only wanted to make fun of her now that she was in trouble.

Xi Keyi didn’t dare to contact Leng Yecheng. She had no idea whether he had heard the news yet. Even if he didn’t know yet, he would sooner or later.

What she didn’t know was that Leng Yecheng had directly deleted all ways of contacting her, because it would be humiliating if he left her in his contacts.

Only people Leng Yecheng trusted was aware of his romantic relationship with Xi Keyi, so they called him because they really cared about him. Therefore, Leng Yecheng answered their calls.

If he refused to answer their calls, they might think he was too heart-broken to talk to anyone. In that case, they would be even more worried about him.

After knowing that Leng Yecheng was fine, the people who cared about him were very relieved.

…

Han Yu was doing much better now. After making sure that he was totally fine, he called Leng Xiaoyao and transferred fifty million yuan to her.
