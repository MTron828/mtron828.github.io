924 It Is a Scheme

“Miss Gu, thank you so much for saving my life!” Tang Xiaoxiao thanked Gu Ning with sincerity.

As a famous A-list actress, Tang Xiaoxiao’s name often appeared on the list of the hottest topics on Weibo. She paid a lot of attention to the news about her, and so also got to know a lot about Gu Ning. She admired Gu Ning for her unbelievable achievements at such an early age.

The majority in the entertainment industry was aware of what Gu Ning had done, including Tang Xiaoxiao’s agent, but she was too busy to remember Gu Ning’s face. That was why she failed to recognize Gu Ning at the very beginning.

“It’s no big deal,” Gu Ning said.

“Miss Gu, you must have heard what they just said to me, right?” Tang Xiaoxiao asked.

“Yeah.” Gu Ning nodded, but said nothing further.

It wasn’t uncommon to hear gossip in the entertainment industry, and Tang Xiaoxiao was already used to it. She needed attention and the company needed her to make money by gaining attention, so she accepted this unspoken rule.

However, this time was different. The gossip about her and Lord Cen wasn’t arranged by the company she worked for, and Lord Cen was a married man, which almost ruined Tang Xiaoxiao’s reputation.

She knew that Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl, so she hoped that Gu Ning could help her.

“Miss Gu.” Tang Xiaoxiao struggled to sit up, but her agent, who was still applying medicine to her injuries, was scared. “Lie down! It’s not done yet,” her agent said anxiously.

“Just talk to me while lying on the bed.” Gu Ning also stopped Tang Xiaoxiao from getting up.

She knew that Tang Xiaoxiao was going to tell her something about the gossip. She was right.

“Miss Gu, it’s a scheme, and I am not the other woman in Lord Cen’s family. We dined together in order to talk about business, but it turned out to be a scheme. Miss Gu, you’re well-known for your outstanding ability. Could you please help me out this time? I’m willing to do anything for you as long as it’s in my ability,” Tang Xiaoxiao said with strong emotions.

Gu Ning wasn’t surprised to find out that the gossip was a scheme, because schemes in the entertainment industry were no less than those in politics.

It was hard for a good actor without powerful support to become famous nowadays. If an actor didn’t have powerful support, he or she could only relied on his or her talent and skills.

In Gu Ning’s eyes, Tang Xiaoxiao was an excellent actress who was good at acting, singing and dancing.

Although Tang Xiaoxiao hadn’t won any supreme accolades yet, it was very normal because she just became popular a short time ago. Besides, many accolades were given to those who had powerful support now.

Gu Ning didn’t know much about Tang Xiaoxiao; she just remembered her name and face when she was reading information about actors on the Internet.

Although there was a lot of gossip about Tang Xiaoxiao, she had done nothing amoral. Therefore, Gu Ning was willing to sign her if she was an upright person.

Tang Xiaoxiao was already a popular actress. As long as she could handle this scandal well, it was very likely that she would become more famous. However, her career would be ruined if she failed to overcome this crisis.

Since she turned to Gu Ning for help, Gu Ning would certainly solve the problem.

“Do you know who set you up?” Gu Ning asked.

“I know. Her name is Fan Sixuan,” Tang Xiaoxiao said feeling sad.

Tang Xiaoxiao and Fan Sixuan were classmates and roommates back in university. They used to be very close and even rented rooms together after graduation. However, Tang Xiaoxiao was luckier than Fan Sixuan, and got many roles after auditioning, while Fan Sixuan could only be an extra.

In fact, Tang Xiaoxiao was simply a better actress than Fan Sixuan.

As time went by, Fan Sixuan got jealous of Tang Xiaoxiao.

They cut off their relationship one day because Tang Xiaoxiao offered to lend money to Fan Sixuan on her own initiative when Fan Sixuan lacked money, but Fan Sixuan thought that Tang Xiaoxiao was trying to humiliate her with money.

No matter how Tang Xiaoxiao explained it, Fan Sixuan wouldn’t listen, and she soon moved out. Afterwards, they seldom contacted each other.

Tang Xiaoxiao also saw through Fan Sixuan, and gradually forgot her.

They met each other again a year ago. They were both cast in the same TV show. Tang Xiaoxiao was the leading actress, while Fan Sixuan played the supporting role. Probably because Fan Sixuan was jealous of Tang Xiaoxiao, she acted the evil female role very well.

In that case, Fan Sixuan got a lot of attention as well as criticism. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

After that, Fan Sixuan got more chances to show her face in TV shows. Now, Fan Sixuan was a B-list actress.

The new TV show, Palace, was invested by the Cen family, and Tang Xiaoxiao received an invitation to audition. She passed it and also signed the contract.

Lord Cen dined with her later to talk about the show, but the scandal erupted.

Once the scandal went viral, the company Tang Xiaoxiao worked for didn’t help her solve the problem, but instead wanted to end the contract with her. It was obvious that the company she worked for was also under great pressure.

Fan Sixuan called Tang Xiaoxiao yesterday and told her that it was her scheme.
