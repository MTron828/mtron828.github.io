Chapter 2100: The Girl Who Likes Mu Ke

“I have no idea. I just don’t want the gathering to be over so soon,” said Chu Peihan.

“There aren’t many activities we can do at night. We can go to a bar, music club, or amusement arcade. Which do you prefer? Have a seat in a bar, sing songs in a music club, or play games in an amusement arcade?” asked Gu Ning.

Hearing that, Chu Peihan said, “Let’s go to a bar!”

“We agree,” said Mu Ke and Yu Mixi.

“Great, then let’s go to Song Nan’s bar,” said Gu Ning. She disliked unfamiliar bars, so Song Nan’s bar was the best choice.

The others agreed.

Because it was still early, they decided to walk around in a nearby shopping mall.

When they were shopping, Gu Ning remembered that she would go back to Century City tonight, so she called Zi Beiying and asked her whether she wanted to hang out together.

Zi Beiying was free anyway, so she agreed.

“Mixi?”

As they walked around, they heard a female voice calling Yu Mixi’s name.

Hearing that, everyone turned to look at her and saw two young girls at the same age as them.

They should be Yu Mixi’s schoolmates.

One of them was indeed Yu Mixi’s schoolmate, while the other was the friend of her schoolmate.

However, Yu Mixi seemed a little displeased to see her schoolmate, but she still greeted her with a smile. “Hi, Zhao Ran!”

“Oh, it’s really you! I thought I was wrong!” Zhao Ran happily said when she was sure it was really Yu Mixi. Then she turned to look at Mu Ke next to Yu Mixi with affection flashing in her eyes. “Hi, Mu Ke!” She greeted him afterwards.

The others didn’t notice the flashing affection in Zhao Ran’s eyes when she stared at Mu Ke, but Gu Ning did. She slightly squinted, then gave a glance at Mu Ke and Yu Mixi.

“Hi, Zhao Ran.” Mu Ke replied. He was polite, but deliberately kept a distance from Zhao Ran. He didn’t notice the admiration in her eyes either.

Anyway, Yu Mixi saw it, so she became angrier.

Yu Mixi knew that Zhao Ran admired Mu Ke from afar, so she was unwilling to see her.

Seeing their reactions, Gu Ning understood that Yu Mixi was aware of Zhao Ran’s special feelings towards Mu Ke.

However, even if Yu Mixi knew, Gu Ning thought she should still talk about it with Yu Mixi later or it might cause unnecessary trouble.

“Zhao Ran, I need to go with my friends now. Bye-bye,” said Yu Mixi. She had no intention of talking with Zhao Ran for longer.

She knew that Zhao Ran admired her boyfriend, so she was unwilling to let her close to her boyfriend.

Zhao Ran didn’t know that Yu Mixi was already aware of her affection towards Mu Ke. If she knew, she would have a different attitude towards Yu Mixi.

“What? Are you leaving right now? Or will you continue to shop? If you’re going to shop for a while longer, why don’t we shop together? It’ll be more enjoyable if we shop together,” said Zhao Ran in a hurry. She really wanted to join them. To be specific, she wanted to shop with Mu Ke.

“I’m sorry, we’ve shopped for a while and it’s time to leave now,” said Yu Mixi, becoming a little tough.

“Are you going back to school? I don’t want to shop any while longer either. Why don’t we go back together?” said Zhao Ran. She didn’t want to miss this chance to stay with them.

Chu Peihan couldn’t see Zhao Ran’s affection for Mu Ke, so she was unaware of her purpose, but she disliked her for being so relentless. However, it was Yu Mixi’s schoolmate, so she said nothing.

Gu Ning knew Zhao Ran’s real purpose, but she had no plan to be involved.

“I won’t go back to the school, I’m going to my friend’s place,” said Yu Mixi.

“Friend? You have a friend in the capital?” Knowing that, Zhao Ran seemed a little upset and jealous.

Yu Mixi was from a small city. How could she have a friend in the capital?

In Zhao Ran’s eyes, a third-tier city like City F was a small city because she was from a first-tier city.

Since she knew Yu Mixi, she had learned some about Yu Mixi’s family background. Yu Mixi’s parents only owned a small restaurant, while her parents both worked in a state institution, so she believed that Yu Mixi wasn’t comparable to her. However, Yu Mixi used Kouzi and had such a handsome boyfriend. She even had a friend in the capital.

Thinking of that, Zhao Ran grew more jealous of Yu Mixi.

At this moment, Chu Peihan finally saw the jealousy in Zhao Ran’s eyes. She couldn’t help but open her mouth. “Why can’t Mixi have a friend in the capital? Is it very strange?”

Zhao Ran didn’t notice Chu Peihan and Gu Ning until she heard Chu Peihan’s voice.

Because she focused on Mu Ke, she ignored the other people at his side.

They were very pretty. It was Zhao Ran’s first impression of them, but she became even more jealous afterwards.

Zhao Ran’s friend had noticed Gu Ning and Chu Peihan earlier on, but she wasn’t jealous.

Zhao Ran wasn’t ugly, and she was beautiful too, but she was barely comparable to Gu Ning and Chu Peihan. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“No, I didn’t mean that.” As if she was scared, Zhao Ran put on an innocent look and explained at once.

It seemed she was just bullied.

As she said that, she even glanced at Mu Ke, hoping he could stand out for her.

Mu Ke, however, didn’t bother to give her a glance because Mu Ke was only close to Yu Mixi, Gu Ning, and Chu Peihan who were his good female friends. He always politely kept a distance away from other girls, and didn’t bother to pay more attention to other girls.

Although he could hear that Zhao Ran felt aggrieved, he didn’t think Chu Peihan’s words were wrong. In fact, he was dissatisfied with Zhao Ran’s words. Chu Peihan only argued with her. She didn’t bully her.

Seeing Zhao Ran’s reaction, Yu Mixi was mad. How dare Zhao Ran try to win her boyfriend’s sympathy right in front of her?

Chu Peihan rolled her eyes at Zhao Ran’s behavior. Without paying more attention to her, she pulled Gu Ning away after dropping a simple sentence that she was leaving.

Yu Mixi and Mu Ke said nothing either and followed them right away.

Zhao Ran closed her mouth this time and watched them walking away, but there was obvious hatred and jealousy on her face.

Yu Mixi’s friend just embarrassed her in public, and Yu Mixi didn’t defend her, which was unacceptable in her eyes.

“Ranran, are you alright?” Seeing Zhao Ran’s annoyance, her friend asked with concern.
