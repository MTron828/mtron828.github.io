Chapter 12: Gu Qing’s Family

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning’s face changed a little, but not because of Mu Ke. She knew Mu Ke cared about her.

Thus Gu Ning asked him back for fun, “Do I look like I’m in a bad condition?”

Um.

Mu Ke was struck dumb. Gu Ning was absolutely fine and well. She seemed like nothing had happened at all. Or, she wouldn’t have been able to knock down two grown-ups.

“That’s great, and now you know what kind of a person he is. So...” Mu Ke intended to tell Gu Ning to give up any illusion on Qin Zheng, but he thought it wasn’t his business after all.

“It’ll never happen again. I’ve already given up on Qin Zheng.” Gu Ning knew exactly what was on Mu Ke’s mind. She didn’t care at all.

“Great to hear that,” Mu Ke felt relieved.

Mu Ke wasn’t in love with Gu Ning actually. He just hated to see an innocent girl be bullied.

“It’s late now. I have to go home,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure, bye-bye,” Mu Ke replied.

Since Gu Ning had made a lot of money today, so she took a taxi to go home.

Gu Ning wanted to buy a smartphone at first, but it was too late for that. She didn’t want Gu Man to be worried, so she got home directly.

Indeed, Gu Man called her once when she was halfway, while it took Gu Ning another 20 minutes to be home.

The taxi line was shorter and faster than a bus, so Gu Ning had spent only 40 minutes on her way home.

A half less time than the bus.

When Gu Ning had arrived at her home, it was almost six pm. Gu Man had already prepared the dinner.

Gu Qing’s family were here today too. They came to visit Gu Ning because she had just left the hospital.

Gu Ning’s uncle named Jiang Xu, and her cousin called Jiang Xinyue.

“Ningning’s home.”

The minute Gu Ning walked in, Jiang Xu and Gu Qing welcomed her.

“Aunt, uncle and Xinyue, nice to meet you all,” Gu Ning greeted them.

“Sister, nice to meet you too,” Jiang Xinyue greeted Gu Ning. She was a shy girl.

Jiang Xinyue was 15 years old now. She was a third grade student in middle school, and a quiet girl of few words. Luckily, she wasn’t as self-abased as the old Gu Ning. She was academic and had lots of friends.

Among the young generation in the Gu family, Jiang Xinyue only liked Gu Ning. For the rest, she had seen them through.

Jiang Xu was two years Gu Qing’s senior, 45 years old, but looked older than his real age. He worked as a truck driver in a construction site. It was a labor work.

Jiang Xu earned thousands of yuan every month. With Gu Qing’s salary, they lived a better life than Gu Ning and her mother.

However, the family of Gu Qing still lived on a tight budget. They were not able to buy a house, but lived in a rental one.

Though City F was a third-tier city, the house price wasn’t low, especially in the downtown.

Even in the suburb, it cost at least hundreds of thousand yuan to buy a house for the whole family to live.

Jiang Xu’s parents had passed away for a long time, so he didn’t need to support his parents, but it was still very hard for him to save enough money because of expenditure on renting and tuition. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

So it was a sky-high price for them.

As long as they had food to eat, clothes to wear, and their child could go to school, they felt happy.

Although the family of Gu Qing lived on a tight budget, they would help Gu Ning and Gu Man whenever they could.

When Gu Ning had been in hospital, the rest of the Gu family had ignored. Even when Gu Man had called them to borrow money, they all had rejected.

Only Gu Qing and Jiang Xu had visited Gu Ning. Moreover, they had given Gu Man all of their savings to help Gu Ning with the surgery.

Fortunately, Gu Ning had recovered at the end.

Gu Ning didn’t want to tell Gu Man that she had earn a lot of money. She wanted to wait till she could afford a house.

And she surely would never forget the family of Gu Qing. She would also help them to live a good life when she became rich in the future.

Thinking of that, Gu Ning opened her mouth suddenly, “Mom, aunt, and uncle. I promise I’ll let you live a good life when I become successful in the future.”

Everyone was surprised by Gu Ning.

No matter if it was going to be true or not, they felt happy that Gu Ning cared about them.

And Gu Ning had just grown up, her future was still unpredictable.

“Great. We’ll wait till the day come. Ningning, we believe you can be successful.”

“Exactly, we all believe you.”

Gu Qing and Jiang Xu was moved, and encouraged Gu Ning at the same time.

Gu Man then found out Gu Ning had changed. She was more outgoing now than before.

Because they really loved each other as family, they had a good time that day.

Lying on the bed before falling asleep, Gu Ning took out her notebooks to read.

Though Gu Ning was a good student in her previous incarnation, but not excellent enough. It was harder for Gu Ning in this incarnation to get into college. So, Gu Ning had to spend more time and energy on studying.

She opened her notebooks, reading them ten lines at one sight. The content had all deeply borne in her mind.

The Jade Eyes was really extraordinary.

...

The second day was Monday.

Gu Man had already call Gu Ning’s head teacher for a few days leave due to her accident. Though Gu Ning was fine now, Gu Man still wanted her to stay at home.

But Gu Ning believed otherwise, she wanted to go the school.

Gu Man agreed at the end.

Gu Ning had encountered Shao Feifei yesterday. She didn’t want her head teacher to know that she had recovered but wasn’t willing to attend the classes.

Gu Ning didn’t care about the difficulties. She just didn’t want to get into any more trouble.

The first class was at 6:50 am. It took Gu Ning around 20 minutes to get to her school by bus. Normally, Gu Ning would get up at six o’clock in the morning.

Gu Man went to work at half past eight, because the factory wasn’t far away. It took Gu Man half an hour on her way to work, so she left home at 7:40 am.

Thus, to let Gu Man have more sleep, Gu Ning never eat breakfast at home, but would have all her three meals at her school. She only went back home when the last class had been finished.
