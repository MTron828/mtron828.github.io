3237 Fine, I Can Stop!

The Feiyu Team had pursued those suspects for several weeks. Mu Yiyang’s team didn’t come until this morning, but they quickly caught those suspects. It proved that the Feiyu Team was incompetent.

Although some of the Feiyu Team wanted to argue over that, they didn’t know what to say. After all, the Fireworks Team indeed promised to be cooperative, but they refused.

In addition, Mu Yiyang quickly caught those suspects with the others which proved his skill.

“I didn’t catch them alone this time. It was not done by my team either, so I won’t argue with you. We can say that we caught them together. If you dislike my team, try to surpass us with your abilities, but for now we are working together. I hope you can be cooperative for the sake of this task. If it hadn’t been for you, we could have caught those suspects this afternoon. It wouldn’t have taken us so much time,” Mu Yiyang said. Since this task was a trap, he wouldn’t allow the mastermind to achieve his goal.

The Feiyu Team was surprised. Mu Yiyang was willing to say that they caught those suspects together?

“Are you seriously willing to say that we catch them together?” asked Cheng Yijie with uncertainty in his voice.

“Don’t project your shortcomings on us. We’re different from you. We never carry out tasks with emotions. Tasks are the most important thing in our eyes, and the next is honor.” Mu Yiyang mocked.

He embarrassed and angered the whole Feiyu Team, but it was the truth. Therefore, the Feiyu Team couldn’t say anything about it even though they were displeased.

Mu Yiyang didn’t want to argue with them, so he said, “Alright, we caught them. You can take them back!”

Because his team wasn’t the ones in charge of this task, and they only assisted the Feiyu Team, they didn’t need to escort those suspects together.

“Aren’t you afraid that we’ll say it was done by us?” asked Cheng Yijie. He wouldn’t actually do that. Even if he did plan to, he wouldn’t say anything to Mu Yiyang. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You can try if you want to.” Mu Yiyang sneered. He didn’t care about it at all. If he had worries, he wouldn’t have asked Cheng Yijie to take those suspects back.

Moreover, he knew that Cheng Yijie wouldn’t say that if he really wanted to do that.

There was conflict between them, but it wasn’t serious.

Mu Yiyang trusted Cheng Yijie. Cheng Yijie was a little selfish, arrogant, and competitive, but he wouldn’t return kindness with ingratitude.

Cheng Yijie said nothing else. He took those men from Mu Yiyang and directly left. Li Mochen and the others stayed with Mu Yiyang and his team.

After Cheng Yijie and his teammates left, Mu Yiyang talked to his teammates. “Alright, you can take three days off. Do whatever you want to do! Same rules as always, don’t go too far and stay on standby.”

Normally, they could take a short vacation after finishing a task, but sometimes they had to get back to work if there was a sudden task.

“Yes, sir!” Everyone was excited when they heard that they could have a few days off.

“I’m curious. How did you find those people?” Lin Mu asked curiously. That was what everyone wanted to know. Therefore, as soon as Lin Mu asked that question, the other teammates looked at Mu Yiyang and the others curiously. They hoped that Mu Yiyang would tell them.

“Miss Leng found them. I did nothing from the beginning to the end. The credit should go to her,” Mu Yiyang said. He didn’t feel embarrassed even though he didn’t catch the suspects. It wasn’t his effort, so he wouldn’t steal the credit.

However, he couldn’t tell them the details, so he immediately interrupted. “Alright, go now! We need to rest as well.”

Hearing that, the others dispersed.

They wouldn’t leave right now. It was late at night, so they would rest in the hotel first.

Before Li Mochen and the others came, Mu Yiyang had booked rooms for them, so they would directly go there.

“Where do you want to go next? Take me with you,” Mu Yiyang said. He felt that it was more interesting to be with Li Mochen and the others. He didn’t want to go with his teammates nor did he want to go back to the capital city.

“Where do you want to go?” Li Mochen turned to ask Leng Xiaoyao.

“Since we’re here, we can enjoy ourselves for two more days. We can go home on Sunday night.”

“No problem.” Li Mochen said, “We’ll go wherever you want to. Yiyang can also tell us where it is good to go. You can choose.”

“I’ll see where we can go later,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She was unfamiliar with City Qin, so she didn’t know what places they could visit.

“Sure,” Li Mochen said.

“Mochen, you’re so considerate when you’re with Leng Xiaoyao!” Mu Yiyang joked. He was sure that there had to be something going on between them!

Before Li Mochen said anything again, Leng Xiaoyao opened her mouth. “I’m a girl! Should he care more about you than me?”

“Hey! Are you defending Mochen?” Mu Yiyang said meaningfully.

“So? Are you jealous?” Leng Xiaoyao didn’t deny it, but she showed no affection either.

Nevertheless, Li Mochen’s heart still skipped a beat.

“Why should I be envious? I’ll only be envious of you when you’re a couple,” Mu Yiyang said. He deliberately said that in order to see how they would reply.

“Can’t you be quiet for a while?” Li Mochen said coldly. He thought that Mu Yiyang couldn’t behave.

“Fine, I’ll stop!” Mu Yiyang gave in at once. If Li Mochen was really annoyed, he might be left behind.

Anyway, they would be together for the next few days, so he had time to observe them.

It was 4 am when they got back to the hotel. Without delay, they went to their own rooms.

Because they went to sleep late, Li Mochen told them to sleep more. They could meet for lunch before hanging out.

In fact, even if they stayed up all night, it wouldn’t be a problem. Li Mochen simply said that to let Leng Xiaoyao have some more sleep.

Although Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t be affected even if she didn’t sleep for a few nights. She preferred to have a good sleep if there was no need to stay up so late.

Therefore, when Leng Xiaoyao woke up the next day, it was already 10 am. She surfed on the Internet, looking for interesting places.
