Chapter 2694: Woman in the Ice Coffin

It wasn’t strange that some people closely resembled each other, so Leng Shaoting wasn’t surprised. He simply disliked the man’s actions.

The man in white stopped and didn’t come forward again. At that moment, he got his reason back.

How could this girl be Shen Er? Shen Er was in the ice coffin now, but this girl really greatly resembled Shen Er. They weren’t the same, but they were 80% alike.

“Who are you? What are you doing here?” asked the man in white, sounding annoyed. He didn’t think Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were kind visitors.

“We’re cultivators, and we sensed evil power in this cave,” said Leng Shaoting.

“Do you mean you’re coming to kill me?” The man in white sneered. Although he asked that question, his tone was certain.

“Evil cultivators aren’t allowed to exist. We’re just obeying the rules,” said Leng Shaoting.

“The rules? That’s the excuse you, the so-called good cultivators always use when you want to kill for no reason. Why can’t evil cultivators exist? We’re not all bad. I’ve hidden here for over a thousand years. I’ve done nothing wrong, nor have I hurt the innocent. How could you come to kill me just because of a stupid rule? What’s the difference between you and those harmful evil cultivators?” The man in white questioned angrily. He held great hostility towards the so-called good cultivators, because he had suffered from unfair treatment.

The man in white continued. “Do you think we want to become evil cultivators? We were forced to. If we hadn’t been harmed, we wouldn’t have chosen to be evil cultivators. You only want to kill us, but never think of the reason why we became evil cultivators.”

“We know that not every good cultivator is administering justice. We just followed the evil power here. We have the responsibility to kill evil cultivators, but we won’t just do that without a reason. We’re not executioners whose job is to behead other people. So, if you really have hidden yourself here for over a thousand years and have never hurt the innocent, we won’t hurt you,” said Leng Shaoting.

“Really?” The man in white sneered. Obviously, he didn’t believe Leng Shaoting’s words, thinking that Leng Shaoting was lying to his face. “Aren’t you afraid I’ll do something bad in the future?”

“Of course I’ll be worried, so we’ll keep an eye on you. Once you do anything amoral, we won’t hesitate to punish you,” said Leng Shaoting.

Hearing that, the man in white fell silent. He didn’t know whether he should believe Leng Shaoting.

Although he refused to believe Leng Shaoting, he might not be able to survive if Leng Shaoting was determined to kill him. If he chose to believe Leng Shaoting and stopped arguing with him, he might survive today.

“Do you really mean it?” asked the man in white.

“Sure,” said Leng Shaoting.

“Great, if so, you can leave now. Don’t worry, I’ll never leave this mountain or this cave,” said the man in white. It was the truth, but he was also feeling out Leng Shaoting’s attitude.

If Leng Shaoting didn’t believe his words, he wouldn’t trust them.

However, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning didn’t think the man in white would really stay in this cave forever, but he seemed serious, so they couldn’t say he was lying.

He was either being honest, or he was very adept at lying.

Either way, they wouldn’t believe everything the man in white just said. They needed to speak to him further to make sure of it.

“But I still need to ask about something. Did you kill those people outside?” asked Leng Shaoting straightforwardly. When he asked that question, he focused on the man in white’s expression. He wouldn’t miss any of his reactions.

“No.” The man in white seemed very calm and honest. “At least I won’t hurt anyone before they find this grave. I won’t kill them, but I can prevent them from leaking the information. Those bodies were left here by two groups of people after a fight. They met by accident. Some were directly killed, while some were too seriously injured to leave and finally died of starvation.”

Because he was being very honest, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning believed his reply.

Actually, they understood why the man in white would do his best to punish people who found this grave.

If they were the man in white, they would do the same thing.

The man had stayed here for over a thousand years, and didn’t want to be bothered. Those grave-diggers didn’t only bother him, but also tried to steal valuable things from this grave.

“Why couldn’t you leave this cave?” asked Leng Shaoting.

Hearing that, the man in white looked slightly sad. He didn’t immediately reply to Leng Shaoting, but subconsciously turned to give a glance at the stone door of the chamber.

He wasn’t staring at the stone door, but the woman in the ice coffin behind it. However, because the stone door was closed, they couldn’t see her.

“We can only live in this cave. Once we leave it, we’ll lose our lives and disappear. I can’t leave her, and she can’t leave me either,” said the man in white, looking upset. He was talking about the woman in the ice coffin in the chamber.

Gu Ning suddenly remembered how the man in white called her when they met just then. She guessed Shen Er might be the woman lying in the ice coffin in the chamber.

If so, the woman must greatly resemble her, otherwise the man in white wouldn’t mistake her for the woman at that moment.

In order to make sure of it, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to look at the woman in the ice coffin. They were close right now, so she could see her clearly.

Even though she had that guess, Gu Ning was still surprised to see how closely they resembled each other.

They weren’t identical, but they were at least 80% alike.

“Do you mean the woman who greatly resembles me in the ice coffin in the next chamber?” asked Gu Ning with an affirmative tone.
