Chapter 1251 Drag Racing

Normally, it took about two to three hours to get to City G from City F by a car, but Gu Ning would speed up and get there within two hours.“Thanks!” Li Maosong felt quite relieved when he heard that Gu Ning was coming.

“If you come from City F, you don’t need to enter City G, but stop at County X. There is a small road outside County X and you can arrive at Xiaoli Village by walking down it about five kilometers to the right.”

“No problem, I’m on my way,” Gu Ning said and hung up the call.

“Boss, what happened?” Gu Ning’s friends asked her once she finished the call.

They heard that Gu Ning was going to City G right away, but didn’t know why, so they were worried about her.

“There’s an emergency so I must go to City G right now,” Gu Ning said and left them behind without explaining it further.

Chu Peihan and the others couldn’t stop her, so they watched her leaving.

“I hope it won’t affect the National College Entrance Examination,” Hao Ran said.

“Yeah.” Other people agreed.

The National College Entrance Examination was a very important exam in their life, so they had to take it seriously.

While Gu Ning walked out of the school quickly, she called the principal.

The principal didn’t think that it was a good idea if Gu Ning left right before the National College Entrance Examination, but Gu Ning told him that it was an emergency, so the principal agreed in the end.

After that, Gu Ning called her head teacher, Zhang Qiuhua. Since the principal already allowed her to leave, Zhang Qiuhua said nothing.

Gu Ning drove to her school every day recently, so her car was parked right outside. The second she got in it, she drove towards City G as fast as she could.

Along the way, she was caught by many traffic cameras. Gu Ning understood that she broke the speed limit and that her driving license might be revoked, but she had to do it in order to save her friends’ lives.

After she got on the freeway, there was less traffic and Gu Ning accelerated without hesitation. She was simply having a drag race.

Many people were amazed by her driving skills, but a lot of people were swearing at her too.

Some thought that it was very cool, but others thought that it was very dangerous and they were scared when Gu Ning’s car overtook theirs.

It was indeed quite frightening to be overtaken by a fast-moving car on short notice.

When Gu Ning almost reached the freeway of County X, a Lamborghini was driving fast on the road, but Gu Ning easily overtook it and left it far behind, which shocked its driver. “What the f*ck!” A young man was greatly surprised and couldn’t believe his eyes.

He sped up at once, trying to chase Gu Ning. He was driving a sports car, which was supposed to run faster than a Land Rover, but he still failed to catch up to Gu Ning.

“Sh*t! How can a Land Rover be better than a sports car?” The young man was annoyed.

Gu Ning obviously saw the sports car behind her, but she didn’t care about it, nor pay much attention to it.

After one and half an hours, Gu Ning arrived at the entrance of the freeway of County X. However, the sports car wouldn’t leave Gu Ning. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

When Gu Ning left the freeway, it followed her without delay.

Gu Ning didn’t think that it was a coincidence, and the young man must be mad at her behavior so he followed her.

She had to stop at a narrow road outside County X to see what the young man wanted because she didn’t want him to continue to follow her.

Once Gu Ning stopped her car, the young man stopped his in front of Gu Ning’s. Then he got out of it and walked to Gu Ning.

He was a handsome young man about 20 years old who looked to be a college student.

Gu Ning also left her car and asked him, “Why are you following me?”

The young man was stunned the moment he saw Gu Ning. To his astonishment, Gu Ning was a gorgeous girl who looked even younger than him.

“Tell me, why did you follow me?” Gu Ning asked again with impatience.

The young man explained in a hurry. “Please don’t misunderstand me. I don’t want to offend you, but I’m curious to know how you can drive a Land Rover faster than my sports car.”

Gu Ning said, “It’s not a big deal in my eyes. Can you stop following me?”

“Well, my name’s Lin Fei, and I live in City G. Can we make friends?” The young man was unwilling to miss this great chance to make friends with someone who was far better than him.

Some people might be jealous of those who were more outstanding than them, because they couldn’t accept the fact that they weren’t the best. Nevertheless, some people thought that it wasn’t a bad thing to be friends with those who were better than them.

Lin Fei was obviously the latter kind of person.

Gu Ning saw that he was a very nice person, so she gave him her name card. “I’m sorry, but I need to deal with an emergency right now, and I can’t waste a second. Could you please stop following me? You can contact me tomorrow, alright?”

“Sure.” Lin Fei nodded. He had no intention to bother Gu Ning.

After that, Gu Ning got back in her car and drove away.

Lin Fei didn’t follow her this time.
