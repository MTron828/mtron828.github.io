3330 That’s Too Much!

“Boss, isn’t it too much to ask your family to buy a big house?” Wu Minmin asked cautiously, feeling that Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t being filial.

“Well, don’t worry, this money is from my stock trading, not a penny from my family. And I bought the house at a lower price from Mr. Li.” Leng Xiaoyao explained resignedly, not feeling angry at their accusations, but rather appreciating their straightforwardness as friends.

“What?”

The other girls were shocked again. Leng Xiaoyao made money from stock trading?

“Boss, how much did you make?”

“It’s a secret,” Leng Xiaoyao said mysteriously.

Although other girls were disappointed, they didn’t ask further.

“Alright, since you made money from stock trading, we won’t hesitate to let you pay for this trip to the capital city,” An Chenmeng said. At first, she felt a bit embarrassed to let Leng Xiaoyao pay for it, but now she didn’t feel guilty.

“Of course, just bring yourself and some spare clothes.” Leng Xiaoyao said, “The National College Entrance Examination will end on the 8th. I’ll spend a few days with my family. So we can leave on the 12th. Any problems?”

“No problem.” the other girls agreed at once.

Before the National College Entrance Examination, Leng Xiaoyao wanted to call Li Mochen, but failed to get through to him.

It was not just then, he hadn’t been reachable since their last conversation.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t know that he was the leader of the Wolf Gang, but she knew that his work wasn’t common. If he didn’t answer her calls, he must be dealing with some confidential matters. Leng Xiaoyao only hoped that he was safe.

On the day of the National College Entrance Examination, Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng sent Leng Xiaoyao to school in person, but she asked them to leave when they arrived. She couldn’t let them wait outside all day.

Although most parents were waiting outside, Leng Changyuan was getting old. She didn’t want him to wait outside for so long and she wasn’t that fussy.

An Chenmeng’s whole family came to see her off, but she also asked her mother to leave when Mrs. An wanted to wait outside.

“Are you nervous?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“A little, but it’s okay.” An Chenmeng replied. It was inevitable to feel nervous, but she didn’t want to put too much pressure on herself.

“Good luck! Don’t put too much pressure on yourself.” Leng Xiaoyao encouraged her.

“I know,” An Chenmeng said firmly. She had made up her mind to go to a university in the capital city. Even if she couldn’t get into the top one, she would still go to a good one in the capital city with Leng Xiaoyao.

After the afternoon exam ended, students from Class 8 who took the exam at the same school came to see Leng Xiaoyao one after another. Their eyes were shining as if they were looking at gold.

Without them saying a word, Leng Xiaoyao knew why.

When she saw the questions, she was also surprised to find that many of them were similar to the ones she had seen in her previous incarnation, especially in math, where the similarity was up to 80%.

These were the questions that Leng Xiaoyao had discussed with her classmates, so they didn’t find them particularly difficult. They couldn’t remember all the questions that Leng Xiaoyao had discussed with them, but they were still able to do most of them. They began to truly hope for success in the exam and were very grateful to Leng Xiaoyao.

An Chenmeng also frequently attended classes in Class 8 during this period, so she had also heard these questions that Leng Xiaoyao had discussed.

“Boss, you’re amazing! The set of test papers you gave us has so many similarities with the questions of the National College Entrance Examination.” An Chenmeng admired Leng Xiaoyao more than ever.

The questions were only similar, but for math, similar question types were enough for them to get the corresponding answers.

Although An Chenmeng was already a top student, these questions still had a great impact on her and could increase her score by a significant amount.

After the afternoon exam, Leng Yecheng came in person to pick Leng Xiaoyao up and asked her how she did.

“It was all very easy,” Leng Xiaoyao said. It wasn’t arrogance. She really didn’t think it was difficult.

She had basically finished writing after two-thirds of the exam time, but they could only hand in the paper at the end of the allotted time, so she just waited until the time was up.

After checking for any errors, Leng Xiaoyao simply sat there in a daze. The invigilators shook their heads resignedly and thought that she had given up!

After all, the invigilators were from various schools and weren’t from their own school, so they didn’t recognize Leng Xiaoyao. If they did recognize her, they wouldn’t have thought that way.

Leng Xiaoyao found it easy, but Leng Yuqi didn’t write much.

Her grades were originally very good, but after the drama with Chu Jianan, she couldn’t focus on studying. Although her state of mind had improved a lot, there was still an impact.

When they returned home, Leng Changyuan also asked Leng Xiaoyao about the exam, and she said it was very easy. She didn’t mean to show off, but it was perceived as such by Song Meiyu and Leng Yuqi.

Besides, Leng Changyuan only asked about Leng Xiaoyao’s performance and Leng Yuqi was ignored. This made Leng Yuqi and her parents unhappy.

The next day was another day of exams, and then the National College Entrance Examination was over.

Class 8, which had the worst grades, surprisingly had many students who felt it wasn’t particularly difficult.

To thank Leng Xiaoyao, Class 8 pooled money to have a meal together. Because it was to thank Leng Xiaoyao, she didn’t need to pay for the meal. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Although the amount of money wasn’t much, it represented their gratitude, so Leng Xiaoyao didn’t refuse.

The time and place of the meal had been decided long ago. Therefore, everyone met there as soon as the National College Entrance Examination was over.

When Wang Yiming heard everyone discussing the answers and saying it wasn’t very difficult, he couldn’t stop smiling.

Even though everyone had a chance to get into college, the probability would be higher than in previous years.

Everyone used cold drinks instead of alcohol and kept toasting Wang Yiming and Leng Xiaoyao.

Now that the National College Entrance Examination was over, they would have to go their separate ways. Many people felt reluctant to leave, including Leng Xiaoyao.

After the exam ended, Leng Xiaoyao mostly stayed home with Leng Changyuan and occasionally went to the company.

Leng Yuqi went to the capital city on the third day after the exam ended. Song Meiyu asked Leng Yuqi to see Leng Yuchen and have him take her out to relax.

The only people from Leng Xiaoyao’s circle who went to the capital city were Leng Xiaoyao, An Chenmeng, Xiong Manxin, Wu Minmin, and Tong Xiaobei. Gao Lele and Gao Ziyin’s family had arranged for them to travel abroad, and their aunt abroad had already agreed. Therefore, they had to go.

That was just the case.

Leng Changyuan knew that Leng Xiaoyao was going to the capital city with her classmates. He didn’t stop her and also gave her a few thousand yuan, even though he knew that Leng Xiaoyao didn’t need the money.

At 9 am on the 12th, they met at the airport.

After the National College Entrance Examination was over, many students traveled. As a result, they met quite a few people they knew at the airport, but they weren’t all going to the same place.
