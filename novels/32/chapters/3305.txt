3306 Only You Have Big Eyes?

If she had taken the exam in the capital city right after graduating from college, it would have been much easier. However, it had become difficult right now. Nevertheless, she still wanted to try.

Back then, her family wanted her to come back to City Chang, and she had no special feelings for Gao Lei at that time. Therefore, she returned to City Chang.

Upon hearing that, Zhang Yawen was displeased. It seemed that the relationship between Zhou Jing and Gao Lei wasn’t common. Although they weren’t a couple yet, given Zhou Jing’s words, what was the difference between their relationship and being a couple?

She couldn’t believe that Gao Lei was going to transfer to City Chang for Zhou Jing.

Zhang Yawei almost went crazy with jealousy.

…

That afternoon.

Leng Xiaoyao completed the written test without any pressure.

Actually, no one felt much pressure because they were all top students and the first round wasn’t that difficult.

Only the top 50 students would advance to the next round, then only the top 20 would make it to the final.

For that reason, the competition was still fierce, after all every one of them was a top student.

…

After Zhou Jing explained her relationship with Gao Lei, Zhang Yawen’s hostile gaze towards Zhou Jing became even more obvious. Leng Xiaoyao could feel it as soon as she came out so she gave Zhang Yawen a cold glance.

She didn’t know if Zhou Jing noticed her hostile gaze or if it was because Leng Xiaoyao’s gaze was too cold, but Zhang Yawen immediately looked away.

Afterwards, they had a tour around the Capital University.

Leng Xiaoyao had been to the Capital University several times when she was in Dongxia United Kingdom, but it was different now. However, both were equally impressive.

It wasn’t about luxury, it was about solemnity.

Seeing the senior students walking around campus, everyone was envious. Most of them were confident that they could get in, but they hadn’t yet, so they were very eager to join the students in this university.

After an hour, they returned to the hotel for dinner, then went back to their rooms. It was meaningless to review now, but some still studied in their rooms for a while.

Although they didn’t know who would advance to the next round, many were confident about the first round’s written test.

Even those who didn’t feel confident still studied because they were about to write the National College Entrance Examination. Their studying wasn’t just for the competition, but also for the National College Entrance Examination!

The results of the first round would be announced tomorrow at 10 am in the hotel conference hall.

By 9:50 am the next day, most of the participants had arrived at the conference hall. At 10 am, the staff from the Education Bureau came to announce the results.

The first place in the first round was a student from City Hai, the second was Leng Xiaoyao, who was only one point behind the first place, and the third was a student from the Experimental High School of the capital city. The other two in the top three were boys, with only Leng Xiaoyao being a girl.

The top three all got close to full marks, and were only a few points away from perfection.

Mu Beihan was ninth, and Fan Xiaoyu ranked 18th.

Everyone was shocked by Leng Xiaoyao’s second place, especially Fan Xiaoyu.

She thought that Leng Xiaoyao would perform worse than her. She never expected Leng Xiaoyao to be so talented.

Although Leng Xiaoyao felt no pressure during the written test, she didn’t feel overconfident that she would be first. She only knew that she wouldn’t perform poorly.

She wasn’t excited or disappointed when she got second place. Her mind was stable.

The current ranking didn’t represent the final ranking because it was just about the written test. There was also an oral test!

“Not bad,” Zhou Jing said. Even though she hoped that Leng Xiaoyao would get first place, she knew that everyone was talented. It wasn’t easy to get second place. Besides, there were still two more rounds to go.

It was possible that some would go from last to first.

Therefore, even though Leng Xiaoyao got second place in the first round, she couldn’t slack off to avoid being surpassed by others.

“Humph! You’re so proud already. Be careful or you’ll embarrass yourself later.” Fan Xiaoyu started to sarcastically taunt again.

“How about you? You don’t even have the ability to be proud.” Mu Beihan didn’t miss the opportunity to mock Fan Xiaoyu. People who didn’t know them would think that she had a close relationship with Leng Xiaoyao because she defended Leng Xiaoyao all the time.

However, they didn’t see Mu Beihan and Leng Xiaoyao interact at all. They barely talked to each other.

“You…” Fan Xiaoyu was so angry that she glared at Mu Beihan.

Seeing Fan Xiaoyu’s reaction, Mu Beihan felt very happy.

She didn’t target Fan Xiaoyu for no reason. If it was unimportant, she wouldn’t have kept holding a grudge against Fan Xiaoyu. However, Fan Xiaoyu had offended her badly.

They both went to the No.1 High School and their academic performance was similar. They used to be good friends.

However, Fan Xiaoyu framed her for stealing a valuable watch worth thousands of yuan, just because she liked a boy who Mu Beihan didn’t like. The watch was found in her bag,

Back then, she was humiliated in front of everyone at the school.

Later, Mu Beihan revealed her family background and had her parents handle it with the school.

As the daughter of the Mu family, a top wealthy family in the capital city, it was impossible for her to steal a watch worth ten thousand yuan. If she liked watches, she could buy as many as she wanted.

Mu Beihan was the daughter of Master Mu’s second son and she was Mu Yiyang’s cousin.

At that time, Mu Beihan was very low-key, so Fan Xiaoyu didn’t know her family background and dared to frame her boldly. Otherwise, even if she had been bold, she wouldn’t have dared to do that. Instead, she would have done her best to please Mu Beihan.

After fingerprint verification and investigation, Fan Xiaoyu turned out to be the real criminal, and she was expelled from school.

Fan Xiaoyu also apologized to Mu Beihan in front of everyone.

Although the Mu family didn’t pursue it any further, whenever Mu Beihan saw Fan Xiaoyu, she would find fault with her.

Even though it had been a year since the incident, she still held a grudge. It was already very merciful for her to not make Fan Xiaoyu pay a painful price. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Mu Beihan didn’t get angry at Fan Xiaoyu’s fierce gaze but instead felt satisfied. She enjoyed it when Fan Xiaoyu looked at her with dislike but couldn’t do anything about it.

“Why are you staring at me like that? Are your eyes the only big ones?” Mu Beihan asked, giving Fan Xiaoyu a cold and piercing look. Her eyes were even bigger than Fan Xiaoyu’s eyes. It left Fan Xiaoyu feeling scared.

Because they were making a scene in public, everyone saw it.

In terms of beauty, Mu Beihan was slightly inferior to Fan Xiaoyu, but with her imposing manner, Fan Xiaoyu looked pitiful in comparison. This immediately aroused the sympathy of many boys.

Someone stood up for Fan Xiaoyu. “Fan Xiaoyu didn’t provoke you. Why do you always pick on her? Isn’t it too much?”
