Chapter 1059 I Can“t Help You

The public jade bid would begin the day after tomorrow in Burma, but Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting had to leave for City Teng tomorrow, because Gu Ning needed to check the condition of her companies there.They booked plane tickets to City Teng once they were back in the house.Because of the public jade bid in Burma, there weren’t many seats available on planes to City Teng from the capital, so the flight that Gu Ning chose would take off at 9:05 am tomorrow.

Afterwards, Leng Shaoting directly pressed Gu Ning against the bed.

...

Leng Shaojia, at the same time, gathered together with her friends in a bar to talk about how to teach Gu Ning a lesson.

Except for Leng Shaojia and Shi Yanyan, there were two other young and handsome men in the room, but they looked slovenly.

Leng Shaojia asked, “Zhao Kai, do you have any good ideas? I want to teach a little bi*ch a lesson.”

“Who dares to annoy you? How serious do you want to make it?” Zhao Kai asked.

“Don’t disable, nor kill her. Anything else will be fine,” Leng Shaojia said with a malicious face.

“Easy, we can find some men to rape her and take a video of it,” Zhao Kai said.

“Good idea.” Leng Shaojia wore a satisfied smile. “Can you help me with it?”

“No problem,” Zhao Kai said. He had many fair-weather friends who were good at it.

“Give me some information of the little bi*ch, so we can stalk her,” Zhao Kai said.

“Her name’s Gu Ning, 19 years old. Oh, wait a second, let me see whether I can find her photo,” Leng Shaojia said, then searched for Gu Ning’s photos on the Internet.

Leng Shaojia wasn’t aware of Gu Ning’s great fame now, and she only knew Gu Ning was the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry and Kouzi.

Therefore, she typed Gu Ning’s name along with Jade Beauty Jewelry to search for Gu Ning’s photos. However, she found out more shocking news about Gu Ning, and kept reading it.

“What’s wrong?”

Shi Yanyan asked Leng Shaojia because Leng Shaojia looked shocked.

“H-How is it possible?” Leng Shaojia couldn’t believe her eyes.

“What?” Zhao Kai and another man asked her too.

Leng Shaojia didn’t answer their questions, so Shi Yanyan approached to look at the screen of her phone.

There was information about Gu Ning on the screen of Leng Shaojia’s phone, and Shi Yanyan was also astonished after reading it.

She remembered Gu Ning that they ran into in that restaurant last time, but she didn’t expect that Gu Ning was so successful. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Zhao Kai got curious and checked Gu Ning’s information as well. “Jesus, Shaojia, are you going to tell me to teach this girl a lesson? She isn’t weak at all!” Zhao Kai exclaimed with shock.

Zhao Kai had seen some news about Goddess Gu, but he didn’t know Goddess Gu was Gu Ning. He had never met Gu Ning before after all.

However, he was reluctant to mess with Gu Ning once he found out that Gu Ning was the famous Goddess Gu.

The Zhao family was also a super-rich family in the capital, but it didn’t mean that he dared to annoy anybody. He clearly knew that he shouldn’t mess with important or influential figures.

“Well, I don’t think we can catch her, let alone rape her,” another man said.

With a loud sound, Leng Shaojia hit her phone against the table and said in anger, “How is it possible!”

“Shaojia, why do you hate Gu Ning so much?” Zhao Kai asked.

“We had an argument in a restaurant before, and I just found out she’s Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend! She embarrassed my mother and I this afternoon at dinner,” Leng Shaojia said. “I can’t accept it, and I must teach her a lesson!”

Hearing that, the others took a long breath in.

They often hung out with Leng Shaojia, so they heard much about Leng Shaoting. They all knew Leng Shaoting’s importance in the Leng family, and none of them dared or were willing to annoy him.

Since they knew that Gu Ning was Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend now, it was impossible that they would hurt her. It was Leng Shaojia’s grudge against Gu Ning, and they preferred to stay away from it.

“Shaojia, I can’t help you this time,” Zhao Kai said.

Although Leng Shaojia was displeased, she didn’t insist, and drowned her sorrows. Nevertheless, she had no intention to give up.

If Zhao Kai couldn’t help her, she would turn to others for help. She didn’t believe that there was no one who had the ability to punish Gu Ning.

...

The next morning, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting set off early to avoid the traffic.

Before they boarded, Gu Ning called Zheng Peng, and told him the specific time that she would arrive at City Teng so that he could pick her up on time.

Gu Ning and the others wouldn’t reach the airport of City Teng until 1:50 pm.

...

In the lounge, Gu Ning left to use the ladies’ room, and a beautiful girl seized this chance to strike up a conversation with Leng Shaoting.

However, Leng Shaoting put on a cold face the entire time, and the beautiful girl had to leave in the end.

“Oh, you’re so charming and popular! I just left for two minutes,” Gu Ning joked, walking towards him.

Leng Shaoting, however, looked serious. “If I weren’t charming, I wouldn’t have the famous Goddess Gu be my girlfriend.”

“Ha-ha.” Gu Ning was amused.
