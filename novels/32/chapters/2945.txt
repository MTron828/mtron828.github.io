2946 Fail to Overcome the Serious Trouble

Time flew and thirteen years had passed. Leng Xiaoran and Leng Xiaoyao were both eighteen years old.

Leng Xiaoyao had already grown up to be a very beautiful young girl and was no less pretty than Gu Ning. She even had the same character as Gu Ning.

Leng Xiaoran was also very handsome and closely resembled Leng Shaoting. Although his character was also like Leng Shaoting’s, he was much gentler. After all, Leng Shaoting was cold because both of his parents had passed away, while Leng Xiaoran grew up in a happy family with a pair of loving parents.

Leng Xiaoyao had reached the peak of the Golden Core Stage at eighteen years old. She was about to rise to the next level, she was even stronger than Leng Xiaoran.

Both of them had a lot of talent, but Shangguan Yang had foreseen their future when they were just born and saw that Leng Xiaoyao would encounter serious trouble at eighteen years old. Therefore, when she turned eighteen, Gu Ning, Leng Shaoting and her other family were very nervous. They felt it might have something to do with the test when Leng Xiaoyao rose to the next level.

However, even if that was the answer, they couldn’t do anything about it.

It was true that they didn’t know what to do. They could only hope that Leng Xiaoyao would pass it smoothly.

Leng Xiaoyao had no idea about the serious trouble she was going to face. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t tell her until the day arrived.

Although Leng Xiaoyao was full of anxiety and sadness when she heard that, she didn’t want to die or leave her parents, but she knew she couldn’t avoid it forever, so she digested the news the next few days.

She understood that Gu Ning, Leng Shaoting and her other family were worried about her for that, so she comforted them and told them to relax. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Dad, mom, master, don’t be too anxious. Perhaps it won’t end badly,” Leng Xiaoyao comforted. She also said that to comfort herself, because no one knew what would happen.

Because the result wasn’t out yet, it was hard for them not to be anxious.

Gu Ning walked forward and hugged Leng Xiaoyao. She didn’t know what to say because she could do nothing when she clearly knew that her daughter would be in serious trouble.

Shangguan Yang wanted to foresee the result, but he failed no matter how he tried.

“In fact, even if we don’t know the result, it might not be a bad thing. It might not have something to do with the test to the next level either. She could survive,” Shangguan Yang said. He wasn’t lying to comfort them, it was the truth.

However, everyone was still worried, but they had to face it.

Before Leng Xiaoyao was about to take the test to the next level, Gu Ning, Leng Shaoting, and Shangguan Yang went to Kunlun Mountain with her. No matter what serious trouble she was going to encounter, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting had to go with her, but they didn’t tell Leng Xiaoran, or take him with them.

Nevertheless, they were twins and cultivators, so Leng Xiaoran could feel that something bad was about to happen to Leng Xiaoyao.

He asked Leng Xiaoyao about it, but Leng Xiaoyao said nothing. She only said that she was nervous to take the test.

Although Leng Xiaoran believed her, he felt it wasn’t so simple, but he couldn’t know the truth if Leng Xiaoyao refused to tell him. He could only feel anxious, without knowing the details.

At the Kunlun Sect’s place.

Leng Xiaoyao went to cultivate with mixed emotions. Because she was filled with worries, she couldn’t focus and almost made a mistake.

The next day, she finally focused.

Three days later, at noon, the sky above the Kunlun Sect became densely covered with dark clouds, and thunder could be heard from above the dark clouds at any time. The whole scene and atmosphere were really scary.

Leng Xiaoyao would have been calm if she didn’t know that she was going to encounter serious trouble at eighteen years old, but now she couldn’t stay calm.

Gu Ning also wondered whether it was a good thing to tell Leng Xiaoyao about it beforehand.

Although Leng Xiaoyao was anxious because of the serious trouble, she was unwilling to be defeated, so she summoned up her energy and tried to overcome it.

As the dark clouds became thicker, the thunder rumbled louder and louder. Leng Xiaoyao took a deep breath, mentally-prepared.

“Rumble!”

There was a deafening crash, and then a heavenly thunder shot down. Leng Xiaoyao tried her best to avoid it, but she was still hit.

Luckily, it didn’t cause much damage.

Unfortunately, the next thunder became even more powerful and destroyed everything it hit. Only Leng Xiaoyao was fine.

She was still alive, but she was already injured.

Gu Ning and the others were scared to watch it from the side. Finally, it was the last thunder.

As long as Leng Xiaoyao was fine after the final thunder, the serious trouble she would encounter at eighteen years old wouldn’t be this test.

If she was hit in the test, she would be in great danger. However, the last thunder didn’t come down for a long while, and everyone could feel it growing stronger and stronger, which filled them with anxiety.

In the end, the final thunder came down like a flash. Leng Xiaoyao wanted to avoid it, but it was too late, and she was hit accurately.

There was a big hole left on the ground afterwards. Leng Xiaoyao could only feel her body falling deep down into the hole, but she could barely see anything. It was dark all around and she seemed to have fallen into a bottomless pit.

After the thunder finished, the dark clouds went away, and the Kunlun Sect became peaceful again. The pits left by the thunder on the ground were very clear. They could also see Leng Xiaoyao’s torn clothing, but Leng Xiaoyao was nowhere to be found.

In an instant, Gu Ning ran to where Leng Xiaoyao just stood and screamed. “Xiaoyao!”

However, no matter how she searched, she couldn’t find Leng Xiaoyao. Both Leng Shaoting and Shangguan Yang were heart-broken.

Gu Ning felt emotionally injured and passed out.

Shangguan Yang immediately tried to find where Leng Xiaoyao was right now, but surprisingly Leng Xiaoyao was completely lost from this world.

If Leng Xiaoyao was dead, he could still find her, so Shangguan Yang thought of another possibility.
