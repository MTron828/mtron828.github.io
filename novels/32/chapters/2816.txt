Chapter 2817: A Siren?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After they had sex under the effect of alcohol that night, they weren’t embarrassed when they met again because they didn’t think other people would know about it.

“I’m arrogant? It’s ridiculous. You attacked me as soon as I showed up. You’re the bad people here. And even if I’m a little arrogant, it has nothing to do with you. Who do you think you are? How dare you criticize me? If you dislike me, try to do whatever you want to me!” said Gu Ning seriously. She was really displeased with their behavior. She did nothing, but they blamed her for fighting back against their malice.

“You…” Lu Juncheng was mad, but didn’t know what to say.

In fact, he was unwilling to have a grudge against Gu Ning. He was simply jealous of her, so he found fault with her.

“Alright, time for the meeting!” Nie Chenyang gave Lu Juncheng a cold glance.

Lu Juncheng was displeased, but couldn’t say anything further.

After that, the meeting began.

They held the meeting this time in order to raise money.

Gu Ning donated five hundred thousand yuan as usual, which was still the highest number among them. This time, they didn’t pick on her and urge her to donate more because she was rich. They didn’t dare to do that again.

After the meeting was over, Nie Chenyang invited them to have a meal together. Gu Ning accepted his invitation. Anyway, she needed to eat later, so she could join them to show her kindness.

This was the first time that Gu Ning had eaten with them.

Since Gu Ning was present, Yuan Yilin and Lu Juncheng were unhappy, but Gu Ning wasn’t affected at all.

Only a few people in the club were jealous of Gu Ning, the rest of them admired her. Therefore, they didn’t miss the chance to chat with her along the way to the restaurant and in the dining hall.

It filled Yuan Yilin with more jealousy.

After having the meal, they went back to their own classes for the evening class.

When Gu Ning had just reached the door of their classroom, she almost knocked into their head teacher who rushed outside.

“Sir, are you alright?” Gu Ning asked with concern.

“I’m fine. There is an emergency, and I need to leave right now,” said their head teacher in a trembling voice, then hurriedly walked away.

Gu Ning gave a glance at the back of their head teacher, then saw a picture of foreknowledge.

In the picture, their head teacher drove fast on the main road and ignored the red light at the crossroads, then was hit by a private car.

Without delay, Gu Ning chased after their head teacher.

It was obvious that their head teacher wasn’t calm and that something terrible must have happened.

Since Gu Ning had foreknowledge, she must do something.

After a few steps, she reached the side of their head teacher. “Sir, it seems something bad has happened. You’re not in a good condition to drive a car right now. Where are you going? Can I drive for you?”

He Qihang was struck dumb for a second. He wanted to turn Gu Ning down, but he was indeed in a bad mood, so he accepted Gu Ning’s kindness instead. “Please, thank you so much.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“My pleasure,” said Gu Ning, then they ran towards the parking lot outside their school.

In the parking lot, they took a car and drove out without delay. “Mr. He, where are we going?” asked Gu Ning.

“The No. 9 Hospital,” said He Qihang.

“May I know what has happened?” asked Gu Ning again. Since she decided to help He Qihang, she must know more details.

“My wife went back to her parents’ home today, but my mother-in-law just called me. She told me that my wife had a fall. The baby has miscarried and my wife is in danger.” He Qihang choked. Even though Gu Ning didn’t look at him, she knew his eyes must be full of tears.

“Don’t worry, Mr. He, trust me. I can cure your wife,” said Gu Ning.

He Qihang understood that Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl, so he felt relieved when she said that to him.

Gu Ning sped up. Because He Qihang wanted to get to the hospital as soon as possible, he didn’t pay much attention to Gu Ning’s driving skills, but he soon noticed that Gu Ning was extremely skilled at driving.

At that moment, there was a lot of traffic on the road, but Gu Ning skilfully overtook all of them, which amazed a lot of people.

However, some still swore at her and felt that she was rude and aggressive on the road. After all, she drove so fast which could easily cause a car accident.

Normally, they needed to spend about forty minutes on the road, but Gu Ning arrived at the hospital within half an hour. Actually, if there wasn’t so much traffic on the road, she could have halved the time!

However, if Gu Ning didn’t come with He Qihang, He Qihang would have gotten in a car accident halfway there. Although she didn’t know the result of He Qihang’s accident, he might die or be seriously injured if the accident happened.

At the hospital.

They stopped the car, then hurriedly ran towards the operating room.

Outside the operating room, He Qihang’s mother-in-law, brothers-in-law, and sisters-in-law were all waiting.

He Qihang’s mother-in-law was restless, but the other people didn’t seem worried at all.

Gu Ning followed He Qihang to the operation room. When they saw Gu Ning, they were mad.

He Qihang’s brother-in-law said acidly, “Oh, He Qihang, your wife is in the operating room now. Why do you come with another woman? If my sister knew, she would be angered to death.”

He was very unkind.

“Shut up! Don’t be so ridiculous!” Before He Qihang explained it, his mother-in-law snapped at his brother-in-law. She trusted He Qihang, so she didn’t think that there was an abnormal relationship between him and the girl.

Even if there was, He Qihang wouldn’t take the girl here.

“Am I wrong? Why does he come with a girl? She’s a siren!” He Qihang’s brother-in-law argued.

A Siren?

Gu Ning had nothing to do with a siren. Actually, she looked cold and a little aloof. It didn’t seem easy to get along with her.

Actually, He Qihang’s brother-in-law said that on purpose. He didn’t really think He Qihang had an abnormal relationship with this young girl.

“Shut up! You can’t bear the result if you anger someone you shouldn’t mess with.” He Qihang snapped at his brother-in-law at once, then apologized to Gu Ning. “Gu Ning, I’m sorry for the misunderstanding.”
