2931 Let’s Go and See!

Sixty percent of Huang Yuwen’s body was stiff now. He could still talk, but couldn’t make any big movements. He was basically disabled.

Although he wasn’t the mastermind, he was an accessory, so he deserved a serious punishment.

When Gu Ning walked away, she placed Huang Yuwen’s phone down on the table near him, so that he could get it and call for help.

Otherwise he might get seriously hurt.

Huang Yuwen summoned up his strength to get the phone on the table, then immediately called his father.

Although Huang Yuwen’s family were all at home, he could hardly speak now. He couldn’t shout either, so he had to make a call.

Before long, the other members of the Huang family came and took Huang Yuwen to the hospital.

Huang Yuwen didn’t tell them that Gu Ning came to see him, because his family didn’t know about what he had done. And it would take a lot of energy to explain what had happened, so he simply said that his body suddenly became stiff and he found talking difficult.

After having a medical check at the hospital, doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong with his body. They could only see that his blood clotted and circulated slower.

Hearing that, Huang Yuwen was even more scared, because it was very strange.

…

After Gu Ning left the Huang family’s house, she called Tang Yunhang and told him what happened.

Tang Yunhang wasn’t surprised to know that Wei Youwei was the real mastermind, because he had thought that it had to have been done by his political enemies.

Nevertheless, he was still angry.

The problem was finally solved, but it was very late now and there was no flight going home, so Gu Ning went to book a room at a hotel. She decided to go back to City B tomorrow morning.

Unfortunately, drama happened at the hotel. A slightly drunk couple came to book a room, but there were no vacant rooms.

Right at that moment, Gu Ning walked over and took out her Black Card to ask the receptionist whether there were available rooms. The receptionist said there was one left, and the couple became angry and questioned the receptionist.

“We asked you whether there is a vacant room. You told us there isn’t. Why is there somehow one right now? What do you mean by treating us differently? Do you think she’s better than us?” The man angrily shouted at the receptionist.

“There are indeed no available rooms, but this miss has a Black Card, so…” The receptionist explained.

However, before she finished, the man interrupted her. “What Black Card? Shouldn’t she obey the rules of first come, first served? I don’t care. I want this room.”

The man’s words made sense, but there were rules in the hotel, so it wouldn’t work.

“I’m sorry. This is the rule of our hotel. We must obey it,” the receptionist said with determination. She didn’t dare to annoy people who had a Black Card, so she couldn’t satisfy the man’s wants even if he was born in a rich or powerful family.

People who had a Black Card were either their boss’s family members or close friends.

“Do you know who I am? How dare you treat me like this? It’s your honor that I came to stay in your hotel,” the man ranted arrogantly.

“Who are you?” Gu Ning interjected in a flat tone. Whoever he was, she wouldn’t be afraid.

“I’m… Hey, why did you pull me?” The man wanted to say who he was, but the woman next to him pulled his clothes, so he was displeased.

“If there are no vacant rooms, we can go to another hotel,” the woman said, glancing at Gu Ning in awe.

She recognized Gu Ning, so she knew they shouldn’t mess with her.

“Go to another hotel? No, I want to stay here,” the man said. He insisted on staying here, not because he liked this hotel, but because he wanted to argue with Gu Ning and the receptionist. If he gave in right now, he would lose his face!

“Sir, I can see that you’re slightly drunk, so I can forgive you for your attitude. If you leave now, it will be over, but if you want to argue and shout at me, I can blacklist you right away,” Gu Ning said calmly.

“What? You can blacklist me? Who do you think you are? How can you do that? Do it right now if you really can. If you can’t, I disdain you!” The man provoked Gu Ning. He refused to believe that Gu Ning had the ability to put him on the blacklist of the Huangdeng Hotel.

On the other hand, the staff at the front desk didn’t doubt Gu Ning’s words.

Even though they were still polite to the man on the surface, they disliked him very much since he wouldn’t stop making things difficult for them.

Therefore, they didn’t think it was wrong if Gu Ning blacklisted him. Instead, they hoped that Gu Ning would do it right away.

When the man said that, the woman next to him pulled his clothing again, but the man ignored her again. The woman couldn’t stop him or explain because she was unwilling to displease Gu Ning. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Great, let’s see!” Since the man refused to leave and even provoked her, she wouldn’t tolerate him any longer.

It wasn’t a serious problem, and there was no need to cause a sensation, but Gu Ning felt that she should teach him a lesson.

Therefore, she directly took out her phone and called Tang Yunfan.

It wasn’t early now, but it wasn’t 12 am yet, and Tang Yunfan was normally still up at this time. Even if he went to bed, he shouldn’t have been asleep for long, so she wouldn’t bother him

Before long, Tang Yunfan picked up.

Because he knew Gu Ning was in City H, he was nervous when he received her call. “Ningning, what’s wrong?”

“Dad, I ran into a troublemaker at our hotel in the city center of City H. He doesn’t think I can blacklist him, so I want to prove it to him,” Gu Ning explained.

“Oh, no problem. Wait a second, I can give the order and the hotel manager will go to meet you at once,” Tang Yunfan said. He supported Gu Ning whenever she wanted to do anything.

He understood that Gu Ning was a reasonable girl, and she said that it was a troublemaker, so the man deserved it even if he was put on the blacklist.

“Thanks,” Gu Ning said and hung up.
