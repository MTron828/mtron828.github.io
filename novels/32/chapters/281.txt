“Well, I’ll figure out another way.” Wang Hongming was displeased, but he didn’t blame Wang Zhilin. After that, he hung up.

Wang Zhilin was relieved that Wang Hongming didn’t blame him.

Wang Xinyan was standing right by Wang Hongming’s side. Hearing that their plan failed, she refused to give up. “Grandpa, please don’t let them get away with it so easily!”

“Alright, alright, I promise that I won’t.” Although Wang Hongming sensed that Gu Ning wasn’t simple, he still tried to defend the Wang Family’s dignity. In the beginning, Wang Hongming planned to help Wang Xinyan punish them, but now he was doing it for himself, because he felt humiliated that the Wang Family could do nothing about it.

After Gu Ning’s group left the police station, Gu Ning told Yan Shuya again that she could call her if anything happened, because the Wang Family wouldn’t give up just like that. Meanwhile, the Wang Family had completely irritated Gu Ning this time. Even if they wanted to give up, Gu Ning wouldn’t allow them to get away with it. After what had happened today, Yan Shuya and Gu Ning were in the same boat now.

Yan Shuya clearly understood that she couldn’t stand up against the Wang Family, or she wouldn’t have tolerated Wang Xinyan’s bullying for so long. Luckily, she had Gu Ning’s support now, so she was more than willing to keep in touch with her.

It was almost 12 pm before the problem was solved. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting took a taxi heading back to the hotel then they drove to the factory building in Leng Shaoting’s rented car.

When they got back to the hotel, the receptionists were all surprised to see them coming back safely, because they had heard that the daughter of the Wang Family was involved. The Wang Family was one of the four most influential families in City Teng. If they could punch Miss Wang and still be safe, they had to be more influential than the Wang Family!

On their way to the factory building, Gu Ning sent a message to K. She wanted him to search for the Wang Family’s illegal behavior and evidence as soon as possible. As long as she could get the evidence of the Wang Family’s illegal behavior, she could unseat them easily. Gu Ning didn’t believe that the Wang Family had done nothing illegal.

When Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting arrived at the factory building, everyone was busy working.

Gu Ning told them to pack the jade that had been cut out and they moved it to their store. Afterwards, she asked Zheng Peng to send messages to the representatives of the jewelry companies. They would hold an auction around 2 pm at Colorful Jade Provider.

It was still an hour and a half away from 2 pm, so they decide to have lunch first before they went back to the store. Gao Yi and Qiao Ya then went to buy takeout for them.

Yesterday, all the representatives of the jewelry companies had heard that Colorful Jade Provider would put jade on sale today, so they all sent people to wait at the Colorful Jade Provider Office. Once the jade was on sale, they would come without delay. However, during the morning, the door of Colorful Jade Provider Office was still tightly closed, which made them feel nervous. Fortunately, each of them received Zheng Peng’s message before noon.

After the meal, Gu Ning’s group left for the street of stone gambling.

However, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t show up with Zheng Peng. They arrived earlier than him to pretend that they were just onlookers.

Around 12:15 pm, there were already many people waiting outside of Colorful Jade Provider Office. Some were sent by representatives of jewelry companies, some were rich businessmen who wanted to buy jade, some were onlookers, and some were from other jade providers.

Especially the three largest jade providers in City Teng. They all sent people to help them collect the latest information about Zheng Peng’s store.

In fact, there were at least eight jade providers in City Teng, but the Zhang Family, the Wang Family and the Lu Family were the most powerful ones. It was universally known that jade was hard to get, so the jade business was highly profitable.

Zhao Yuefeng came to the store as well, and he greeted Gu Ning the minute he saw her. “Miss Gu, what a coincidence!”

“Hi, nice to meet you, Mr. Zhao!” Gu Ning said.

Zhao Yuefeng was in a hurry to attend the auction, so he didn’t talk with Gu Ning for a long time.

Zheng Peng and his workers arrived later, followed by the representatives from the jewelry companies.

Zheng Peng then arranged for them to have a seat.

The room was limited in the Colorful Jade Provider Office, so only the representatives from the jewelry companies and the rich businessmen had seats. Zheng Peng brought out all the chairs and it was barely enough for them to have a seat. Luckily, there were only 20 or so who attended the auction.

After all the guests were seated, Zheng Peng had his opening speech and mainly introduced Colorful Jade Provider to them. “Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, Colorful Jade Provider is officially established today! Please allow me on behalf of the Colorful Jade Provider to thank you all for coming!”

“I’m the general manager of Colorful Jade Provider, Zheng Peng.” He introduced himself as the general manager, which proved that he wasn’t the boss. Then, he began to tell them the methods of sale of Colorful Jade Provider, which were the two methods that Gu Ning had told him.

First, they would put jade on sale directly once a week, and the amount was limited to five pieces. Zheng Peng didn’t mention the levels of jade, because no one knew what it was until the jade was cut out.

Second, they could supply between one to three pieces of jade to jewelry businessmen every month. They couldn’t promise that they could cut out high-level jade each month, but they promised to provide each of them with at least medium-level jade. However, jewelry businessmen had to sign a contract with Colorful Jade Provider beforehand, and acquire their jade monthly for two years. Otherwise, they would have to pay liquidated damages.

Zheng Peng simply introduced the two methods of sale and finished his opening speech.
