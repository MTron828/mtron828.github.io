Chapter 547 Do You Need Me to Put a Rope Down?

“So?” Bai Nianlan was still confused and didn’t understand why her husband seemed so excited.

“Well, a student just donated five million yuan to our school for the reconstruction and redecoration,” the principal said, and he had mixed emotions now.

“What? A student? A rich second-generation heir?” Bai Nianlan thought that the student had to be from a rich family.

“Not really, she’s the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry,” the principal said.

Thinking of Gu Ning’s identity, the principal couldn’t help but admire her for her outstanding ability.

“What? It was her?” Bai Nianlan was surprised. She had heard from her husband that the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry was studying in his school, and she also admired Gu Ning. Ever since Bai Nianlan had heard what Gu Ning had achieved at such a young age, she always wished that her children could be as successful as Gu Ning.

Right at that moment, Bai Nianlan’s son came back home after playing basketball with his friends, and he had sweat a lot and had an unpleasant smell, which annoyed Bai Nianlan. Bai Nianlan then began to criticize her son, while her son had no idea why his mother suddenly became so mad at him.

After a while, he finally figured out that his mother thought that he wasn’t outstanding enough after hearing the story of an excellent student in his father’s school. However, he felt aggrieved too. In fact, he wasn’t bad compared with his peers and was also a good student in his school. Even so, he didn’t dare to argue with his mother, but listened to his mother’s endless criticism with patience.

In City B, Gu Man was asleep around 11 pm, so Gu Ning sent a message to Leng Shaoting at once.

The hotel where Leng Shaoting stayed wasn’t far, so he soon arrived at Gu Ning’s house after reading her message. He called Gu Ning when he arrived and went to the side of Gu Ning’s bedroom following Gu Ning’s directions. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

When they saw each other, there was a burning desire in their eyes.

“Do you need me to put a rope down there?” Gu Ning joked. She knew that it was easy for Leng Shaoting to climb up three stories.

“No need,” Leng Shaoting said then hung up. Quickly, he had easily climbed up to the third floor with just his hands. When he stood in front of Gu Ning, he clasped her in his arms like he hadn’t seen her in ages.

“Ningning, I missed you,” Leng Shaoting said although they had only been apart for half a day.

“My mom’s bedroom isn’t far away so we need to be quiet,” Gu Ning warned.

“Sure, I’ll hug you while we sleep, and we won’t do anything,” Leng Shaoting said. He knew that Gu Man slept in a nearby bedroom, so he didn’t dare to make noise but he was already satisfied that he was able to hug Gu Ning and fall asleep together tonight. Although they didn’t have sex, they did kiss and touch each other in bed.

The next day, when light first appeared, Leng Shaoting woke up. In case Gu Man would find out, and it was also inconvenient to leave during the day, Leng Shaoting left Gu Ning’s bedroom.

Cao Wenxin called Gu Ning in the early morning, and she wanted to visit Gu Ning. Cao Wenxin felt bored now and would love to have some fun with Gu Ning.

“Um, I’ll call you back later,” Gu Ning said. Cao Wenxin didn’t know what had happened to Tang Yunfan yet, so Gu Ning wasn’t sure whether she could tell Cao Wenxin.

After hanging up the call with Cao Wenxin, Gu Ning called Tang Haifeng at once.

Tang Haifeng didn’t keep it a secret from Cao Wenxin on purpose, but he didn’t want to worry the younger generation. Since Cao Wenxin wanted to spend the day with Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin would find out sooner or later, Tang Haifeng agreed. Therefore, Gu Ning called Cao Wenxin back and told her that they would go to the Tang Family’s house later.

Hearing that, Cao Wenxin got up at once.

It was already 7:30 am but Cao Wenxin was still lying in bed. Although she had a habit of running in the morning, she would sometimes be lazy, especially when the weather was cold. And although it was already spring, it was still cold outside.

Cao Wenxin came to Gu Ning’s house around 8 am, and the breakfast was ready on the table.

Seeing Gu Man, Cao Wenxin greeted her politely.

“Do you want to drive your car, or drive with me?” Gu Ning asked Cao Wenxin during breakfast.

“I’ll drive with you,” Cao Wenxin said. She was determined to spend the whole day with Gu Ning

After breakfast, the three of them left the house. However, when Gu Man saw Gu Ning’s car, she was astonished, because she recognized that the car was a Lamborghini, which was very luxurious.

“Ningning, how must is your car?” Gu Man took a long breath in before she asked.

“Aunt Tang sent it to me, and it costs over ten million yuan,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Gu Man was shocked. “They-they’re too generous!”

Gu Ning received the luxurious car as a gift when the Tang Family didn’t know that she actually was Tang Yunfan’s biological daughter, so it was enough to prove that the Tang Family was really generous.

“The gifts Ningning sent us are also very valuable. A luxurious car is merely nothing,” Cao Wenxin said.

Hearing that, Gu Man relaxed a little.

After that, they got in the car, driving away from the duplex.

When Gu Ning and the others left the house, it was 8:30 am, so there wasn’t much traffic on the roads.

Not far behind Gu Ning’s car was another luxurious car, and the people sitting in it started to discuss Gu Ning’s white Lamborghini.
