810 Lord Leng Is Gu Ning“s Boyfriend

Right when Gu Ning was about to answer Tang Qingyang’s question, her sight fell on a man not far behind him.

Leng Shaoting arrived, but was displeased. He was thrilled to see Gu Ning at the beginning, but noticed her talking and laughing with a man the moment he walked out, so he instantly felt displeased. She came here to pick him up, but she didn’t see him until he walked near because she was enjoying the talk with another man. It was hard for Leng Shaoting not to be jealous.

Xu Jinchen and Xin Bei who walked by Leng Shaoting’s sides also sensed his unhappiness. They exchanged a resigned look. Their boss was really a jealous boyfriend. Gu Ning was just chatting with another man, which wasn’t a big deal in their eyes. However, if it had happened to them, they would have the opposite feeling.

Seeing Gu Ning’s reaction, Tang Qingyang also turned around, following her sight. When he noticed Leng Shaoting’s cold face, he got a little nervous and realized that the man was displeased because of him.

Tang Qingyang complained to himself that this man got jealous so easily. He was just chatting with Gu Ning, but the man was full of hatred towards him. It also proved that the man loved Gu Ning very much.

Gu Ning understood that her boyfriend got jealous again. She didn’t think that it was a good thing, but still had to comfort him, so she directly ignored Tang Qingyang and walked to Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting strode to Gu Ning as well, then squeezed her hand in his big palm, like Gu Ning would escape once he loosened his hand.

Gu Ning didn’t know what to say, because it wasn’t the right time to explain it to Leng Shaoting.

“Hi, Lord Leng,” Tang Qingyang said to Leng Shaoting politely.

Leng Shaoting frowned. “Do you know me?”

Leng Shaoting didn’t know Tang Qingyang, and was surprised that Tang Qingyang knew him.

“Yeah, I met you once before by chance, and I also heard that Lord Leng is Gu Ning’s boyfriend,” Tang Qingyang replied.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting felt a little better.

Xu Jinchen and Xin Bei walked over at this moment. “Hi, Gu Ning, been a while!”

“Nice to see you again,” Gu Ning said with a smile.

“Nice to meet you, Lord Xu,” Tang Qingyang said to Xu Jinchen. Because he didn’t know Xin Bei, he said nothing to him, but just nodded.

“Do you know me too?” Xu Jinchen was also surprised.

“I live in the capital too, so I know something about the high society in the capital. My name’s Tang Qingyang, and I’m Jiang Ruiqin’s close friend,” Tang Qingyang said.

“Oh, you’re Ruiqin’s friend! Nice to meet you.” Xu Jinchen greeted Tang Qingyang.

“Well, I’m afraid that I have to leave now. See you next time,” Tang Qingyang said to them, then left.

“You can leave now. Tell me when you find a good place to eat,” Leng Shaoting said to Xu Jinchen and Xin Bei. He was chasing them away, because it was time for him to be alone with Gu Ning now.

“Alright.” Xu Jinchen pulled Xin Bei, walking away.

After that, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning walked to the parking lot.

Leng Shaoting didn’t ask Gu Ning what she was talking with Tang Qingyang about because he trusted her.

Although Leng Shaoting didn’t ask Gu Ning, Gu Ning decided to explain it to him on her own initiative when they got in the car.

Leng Shaoting held Gu Ning’s hand walking out of the arrival hall. The couple of a gorgeous girl and an extremely handsome man attracted a lot of attention along the way. After they were gone, a group of young people recognized Gu Ning.

“Oh, I think the girl was Goddess Gu, right?” a girl said with excitement.

“Really? Where?” Her friends looked around searching for Gu Ning.

“She’s already gone. What a shame!” the girl said.

Gu Ning was nowhere to be found now.

“Are you sure that the girl was her?” one of her friends doubted.

“I’m sure, because I thought that she looked familiar and kept looking at her,” the girl said.

“Why didn’t you tell us earlier so we could take photos with her?” the girl’s friends all complained.

“I didn’t recognize her at first glance. It isn’t my fault!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

They all felt that it was a shame that they missed the chance to take pictures of Gu Ning.

When Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning arrived at the parking lot, Leng Shaoting got in the driver’s seat at once, then started the car.

“Do you still remember my master I told you about before?” Gu Ning opened her mouth.

“Yeah, you told me that she was born in the Tang family in the capital,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Right, and Tang Qingyang is my master’s older cousin. Tang Qingyang’s father was also murdered by the Tang family in the capital, so we share the same enemy, and I plan to work with him to take revenge,” Gu Ning said. “I used to think that I should ruin the Tang family, but I changed my mind after meeting Tang Qingyang. I think the Tang family should have a new leader.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting nodded, but he still felt a little uncomfortable, because it was very easy for him to help Gu Ning take revenge. There was no need for her to cooperate with Tang Qingyang.

Nevertheless, Gu Ning already told him that she decided to handle it alone, so Leng Shaoting wouldn’t interfere, in case Gu Ning wasn’t happy.

“Oh, my father proposed to my mother. It was super romantic, and the wedding will be held in half a month,” Gu Ning said.

“Glad to hear that!” Leng Shaoting also felt happy for Gu Man. He loved Gu Ning, and cared about her family as well, so he obviously hoped that Gu Man could live a happy life. Gu Man had been through a lot during the past 18 years after all.

“I’ll leave for the capital after a short time. Since my father and mother are back together now, I won’t be worried that my mother will feel lonely,” Gu Ning said.
