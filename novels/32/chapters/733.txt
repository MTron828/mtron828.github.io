Chapter 735 Despise Gu Ning?

Qiao Ya didn’t go there with Gu Ning, because Gu Ning didn’t know when she would go back home, and Gu Man would be safe with Qiao Ya.

Although it was impossible that Feng Xueqin could hurt Gu Man again, Tang Deming was still a threat. Therefore, the Tang family was in a dangerous situation now. None of them were completely safe.

Before Gu Ning arrived, Qi Tianlin and Zuo Jiangkui were already in the gambling room.

Yu Hao and Cheng Hua were standing behind Qi Tianlin, while a beautiful young woman in her early twenties sat by Zuo Jiangkui’s side, and there were four bodyguards at his back.

Zuo Jiangkui was a calculating man who was around 35 years old. The woman by his side was He Hongjie’s fourth daughter, He Siyin.

They arrived at 7:40 pm, but Gu Ning was still absent when it was almost 8 pm, which displeased He Siyin. “Mr. Qi, it’s only five minutes away from 8 pm. Where is your gambler?”

“Isn’t it not 8 pm yet?” Qi Tianlin said in an arrogant tone as always. He didn’t bother to give He Siyin a glance, which upset He Siyin.

Qi Tianlian never paid much attention to her, and she would almost doubt her charm if she didn’t have so many admirers.

“I don’t think it’s polite to keep your guests waiting!” He Siyin argued.

“She doesn’t work for me, but is also a distinguished guest of the Kirin Gang,” Qi Tianlin said. He wasn’t flattering Gu Ning, but was telling the truth. In his eyes, Gu Ning was a distinguished guest. Although he wasn’t very familiar with Gu Ning, there was a very important deal between them. Gu Ning’s magical medicine was unusually effective, so he cherished his relationship with Gu Ning.

“A distinguished guest?” He Siyin was surprised. The He family had a good connection with the Kirin Gang, but Qi Tianlin never treated them as distinguished guests.

When it was three minutes away from 8 pm, Gu Ning entered the room.

Both Zuo Jiangkui and He Siyin frowned when Gu Ning showed up, because they thought that she was just an ordinary young girl. However, if she was able to walk inside without anyone’s permission at this moment, she must be the gambler that Qi Tianlin had told them about.

“Mr. Qi, are you sure the gambler is this girl?” Zuo Jiangkui asked with obvious disdain.

“Right,” Qi Tianlin said, but didn’t explain further. It was to his advantage if they took Gu Ning lightly.

“Come here.” Qi Tianlin waved his hand at Gu Ning. Although he still seemed arrogant, it was obvious that he treated Gu Ning much gentler than he did He Siyin.

He Siyin felt disappointed, because she had never seen Qi Tianlin treat a girl so politely before. Was it because this young girl was more beautiful than her? He Siyin admitted that Gu Ning was very attractive, and she was slightly jealous of her beauty too, but she didn’t hate her, because they were merely strangers.

Gu Ning didn’t feel uneasy at all, but walked towards Qi Tianlin with a calm face, then sat down by his side.

Qi Tianlin didn’t introduce them to each other, but directly said, “She’ll gamble with you on behalf of me in the following hours. You can set the bets as you want, I won’t be involved.”

Although Zuo Jiangkui came here to gamble with Qi Tianlin, it didn’t mean that Qi Tianlin had to play the game with him in person. They just needed to obey the deal no matter who lost the game.

“No problem. I just hope you won’t blame us for taking advantage of a little child.” Zuo Jiangkui laughed.

Zuo Jiangkui was around 35, while Gu Ning was even younger than 20, so she was merely a little child in his eyes.

Zuo Jiangkui despised Gu Ning, but was also willing to gamble with her. He was very confident to win because he believed that Gu Ning lacked experience. He came here to win the game, and didn’t care whether it was fair or not.

“I won’t,” Qi Tianlin said.

“Let me have several rounds with her first,” He Siyin said.

Since Qi Tianlin trusted Gu Ning so much, she was determined to defeat Gu Ning so that Qi Tianlin would have a deep impression of her. She wasn’t much older than Gu Ning, so it was a fair game between them.

“Sure.” Zuo Jiangkui agreed. He believed in He Siyin.

“My surname is He. May I know yours?” He Siyin asked with her voice full of hostility.

“Gu,” Gu Ning said.

“Miss Gu, how much can you afford?” He Siyin asked.

“As much as you can,” Gu Ning said. She sounded very arrogant in order to irritate He Siyin. It was a great opportunity for her to make a large amount of money, so she would, of course, make full use of it.

“Well, Miss Gu, you really don’t care about it since you’re using Mr. Qi’s money,” He Siyin said in a sarcastic tone. She was jealous of Gu Ning, who could spend Qi Tianlin’s money without being limited.

It proved that Gu Ning was very important in Qi Tianlin’s heart. He Siyin thought that Gu Ning might be Qi Tianlin’s girl, instead of a distinguished guest. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Thinking of that, He Siyin was upset. She wasn’t sure whether she liked Qi Tianlin, but she had a burning desire to make him love her because he always ignored her.

Gu Ning frowned and said with dissatisfaction, “I’m not using his money in today’s gambling. If I use his money, I’d have to share with him if I win.” It meant that she was using her own money to gamble with them.

Hearing that, both He Siyin and Zuo Jiangkui were astonished. If Gu Ning was using her own money, she must be very rich. After all, their bets normally started from ten million yuan at the least.

Gu Ning probably didn’t know their rules. He Siyin and Zuo Jiangkui thought.

“Then how much is suitable for the bet per round in your eyes?” He Siyin asked.

“I don’t care. You can set the bet as you want, Miss He,” Gu Ning said. It sounded normal, but was actually quite provocative.
