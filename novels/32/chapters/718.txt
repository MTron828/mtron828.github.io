Chapter 720 Pay Feng Xueqin Back

Around 5:10 pm, Quan Mingkai and Tang Zhilin booked a private room at the Huangdeng Hotel before they called Allan’s secretary.

Allan and his secretary along with another four people who were in charge of the security system arrived at the private room 10 minutes later.

Quan Mingkai stood up to welcome them at once. “Mr. Allan, please have a seat.”

When they were all seated, Quan Mingkai gave Allan the menu. “Mr. Allan, please order whatever you like.”

Allan was a foreigner, so his taste in food was different from them.

“Well, we don’t need to rush. I have a friend who is coming here later, so we can wait for her,” Allan said.

“Sure,” Quan Mingkai said, but didn’t ask him who his friend was.

Afterwards, they chatted casually for a while.

When it was almost 5:40 pm, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting arrived. They were a little late because of a traffic jam on the road.

Quan Mingkai was more than astonished to see Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. “What...” He abruptly stood up from his seat. Quan Mingkai wanted to ask something, but didn’t know how. It was obvious that Allan’s friend was Gu Ning.

“Miss Gu, nice to see you! Been a while.” Allan also stood up to welcome them.

“Nice to see you too, Allan!” Gu Ning shook hands with him.

Although they just shook hands with each other out of politeness, Leng Shaoting was still displeased to see it.

Let alone Gu Ning, even Allan felt Leng Shaoting’s dissatisfaction towards him. Allan was confused, because he thought that there was nothing unpleasant which had happened between them. However, when his hands let go of Gu Ning’s, Leng Shaoting’s unkind look was gone as well. Allan realized that this young handsome man was just being jealous of him.

Allan was amused, but didn’t mind it.

Gu Ning, however, felt a little embarrassed by her jealous boyfriend.

After that, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting sat by Quan Mingkai’s side. “Hi, Uncle Quan,” Gu Ning called him.

“What’s going on here?” Quan Mingkai seemed to understand something, but he wasn’t sure.

“Please have a seat, everyone,” Gu Ning said, and the others all sat down again.

Gu Ning then told Quan Mingkai everything.

“Oh, I understand!” Quan Mingkai said after hearing Gu Ning’s explanation. “I was very confused about why Mr. Allan suddenly changed his mind!”

And now he had the answer. However, they still needed to pay the compensation. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Mr. Allan, I’m so sorry for your loss, and we’ll pay the compensation,” Quan Mingkai said to Allan.

“Nobody wanted it to happen, and I do have sympathy for what your company has been through, but we’ll take the compensation without a doubt,” Allan said. His company couldn’t afford the loss.

Allan then gave the video to Quan Mingkai. After watching the video, Quan Mingkai recognized the person who had a secret meeting with Technology Company E. He was a technical staff member working for Time Technology which was owned by Tanghuang Group.

Quan Mingkai was sharing dinner with Allan, so Yan Weilun would deal with it.

In the following hour, they enjoyed the meal together and discussed the new project.

After dinner, they signed the contract before leaving.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to the hospital later.

Just when Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were leaving for the hospital, Gu Man, Gu Qing and Qiao Ya also walked out of a restaurant at the same time. They had dined on Youyi Road, which wasn’t far from their home, so they went back home on foot.

“Well, although I hate Lin Lijuan, I still feel sorry for her now,” Gu Qing said.

“Yeah,” Gu Man sighed. “I hope that she’ll never remember the terrible experience for the rest of her life. I don’t think that she can accept it.”

“You’re right,” Gu Qing said.

The part of the road wasn’t located downtown, so there weren’t many people. When they walked to a road section with the fewest people, three men rushed at them all of a sudden and surrounded them.

Qiao Ya protected Gu Man and Gu Qing behind her back at once. She coldly looked at them, and didn’t seem scared at all.

Although Gu Man and Gu Qing were frightened, they knew that Qiao Ya wasn’t an ordinary girl, so they were soon relaxed.

“It’s fine,” Qiao Ya said to comfort Gu Qing and Gu Man.

Hearing that, they were relieved.

“Gu Man stays and we can let the other two leave,” a man said.

“Impossible,” Qiao Ya sneered. She didn’t bother to talk with them and attacked them without delay. The three men were all beaten down by Qiao Ya within seconds.

The three men knew some fighting skills, and could easily get control of three ordinary women. However, they ran into Qiao Ya who was an experienced killer today. In Qiao Ya’s eyes, they were merely kids.

Even though Gu Qing and Gu Man knew that Qiao Ya was very good at martial arts, they were still shocked to see the scene.

Qiao Ya was so amazing!

The three men, on the other hand, were struck dumb by the result.

Qiao Ya questioned them about who sent them, and under Qiao Ya’s threats they revealed that the person who sent them was Feng Xueqin. Therefore, Qiao Ya called Gu Ning and told her about what just happened.

Gu Ning wasn’t surprised, because she sent Qiao Ya to protect Gu Man precisely because she knew that Feng Xueqin would take action to hurt Gu Man sooner or later, but she was still mad.

Feng Xueqin, very well.

Gu Ning decided to pay her back this time. However, she still needed to go to the hospital first.

When Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting arrived, Tang Yunhang and Tang Yunrong were in the ward. Both of them were still confused about why Allan had suddenly changed his mind.
