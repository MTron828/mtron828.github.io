Chapter 101: Be Kind

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning finished the papers within half an hour as well, without any hint of cheating. Gu Ning knew that it was hard for someone who knew that she had been bad at studying to accept her change, but true blue would never stain. Now she wasn’t afraid to face her classmates and teachers.

After the afternoon tests, Gu Ning left directly. It was just 4 pm. The appointed time was 6 pm in the Youyi Restaurant on Youyi Road. It took around 20 minutes to walk from Fenghua Luxury Mansion to the Youyi Restaurant, so Gu Man and others planned to leave their houses at 5 pm. Thus Gu Ning went back home first.

She didn’t run this time, but take a taxi instead. Within 20 minutes, she was back at Fenghua Luxury Mansion. Gu Ning had told her family that she had a monthly test today, so Gu Man and the rest were all surprised that she was home so early.

“Why are you home so early?” Gu Man asked.

“I finished the tests, so I’m back,” Gu Ning replied.

“Is it because you didn’t know the answers? It’s fine. We can keep trying,” Gu Qing comforted. They never blamed Gu Ning for her performance, but always encouraged her, because they all knew that not every kid was born academic.

Gu Ning didn’t explain further. The results would be the best proof.

A short while later, Jiang Xinyue got back home as well. She only had two classes in the afternoon, and she left her school at 4:05 pm. She got home at 4:30 pm.

Everyone was ready to leave when it was 5 pm, but Gu Ning stopped all of them. She said, “Why should we go there so early? We always get to the family meal earlier than them. And they are always late. I think it’ll be fine if we just arrive on time.”

“Well...” Gu Man felt that it wasn’t appropriate.

“I think Ningning is right. Why should we be there early and wait for them every time?” Gu Qing immediately agreed. She sat back down again. Gu Man compromised at the end.

Both Gu Man and Gu Qing deliberately didn’t dress up. They were wearing the medium-level brand, and looked normal. No one would know what the brand was if he or she wasn’t familiar with clothing brands. Jiang Xu was in the same style. As for Gu Ning, she was still in her casual suit.

They didn’t leave until 5:30 pm.

They walked to the Youyi Restaurant. When they arrived, it was five minutes away from six pm, but they coincidentally met Gu Qinxiang’s family outside. Gu Qinxiang’s family included Gu Qinxiang, Lin Lijuan, Gu Qinxiang and the old lady.

They were always late for the family meal.

Gu Qinxiang was the richest one in the Gu Family, so he was also the most powerful one. Therefore, he became arrogant and also believed that he was the star in their family.

He was upset when he met Gu Man and others outside.

Except for Gu Qinxiang, Lin Lijuan, Gu Xiaoxiao, and the old lady all changed their faces. Especially the old lady, she was still annoyed that Gu Ning had shouted at her last time. She immediately raised her voice in anger, “Gu Ning the b*st*rd. Who told you to be here? Go away immediately!”

The old lady had lost all her manners, and was behaving like a crazy woman. All of sudden, her voice attracted attention from people around. Although the crowd didn’t know what was going on, they disdained the old lady’s rude behavior.

Gu Qinxiang was surprised by his mother, and also felt embarrassed amid the others people’s looks. He called, “Mom...”

He knew his mother never liked Gu Ning, neither did he. He hated and despised Gu Ning too. Every time they met, the old lady would humiliate Gu Ning, but he had never seen his mother get so mad.

Gu Qinxiang had been busy these days, and he was seldom home, so he didn’t know what had happened the other day.

Meanwhile, Gu Man and others were all immediately in a rage. Gu Man felt like crying. She retorted, “Mom, could you please be kind! Ningning is my daughter. She is not a b*st*rd. Besides, it’s my third brother who asked me to be here.”

The old lady didn’t feel ashamed at all. Instead, she was more annoyed. “She is a b*st*rd! I’ll never admit that she is my granddaughter! If she stays, I’ll leave right now!”

“Mom, what is wrong with you? Can we just talk when we’re in the private room? You’re embarrassing me in front of everyone in public!” Gu Qinxiang was a little displeased.

No matter what, he was a man of a little fame in City F. His mother’s behavior had obviously embarrassed him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, the old lady was so mad that she didn’t care about their faces at all. Moreover, she indeed was a bossy and domineering woman, who only cared about herself. She continued to snap at Gu Ning, “What is wrong with you? You b*st*rd hit Xiaoxiao, but refused to apologize. You even yelled at me! You’re insane!”

Gu Qinxiang was seldom home these days, so no one actually told him what had happened.

Hearing the word “b*st*rd”, Gu Ning, Gu Man and others were all displeased. Gu Ning threw a cold look at the old lady. The old lady was scared and struck dumb at once.

Although Gu Qinxiang preferred to save his face, he lost control of his emotions since his daughter was involved.

“What? Gu Ning hit Xiaoxiao?” Gu Qinxiang changed his face at short notice. His eyes were full of anger as he looked at Gu Ning.

Gu Xiaoxiao criticized Gu Ning without delay, “Yes! Dad, Gu Ning hit my head with a plate, then she slapped me several times. Grandma told her to apologize to me, but she refused to do so. Besides, she even yelled at grandma, and threatened mom!”

After that, she gave Gu Ning a provocative look.

She was afraid of Gu Ning, but now that her father was here as well she wasn’t afraid any more.

The crowd now all looked to Gu Ning with shock.

What?

She hit the girl with a plate, and even slapped her. She refused to apologize, then yelled and threatened the older generation?

If so, the young girl was very violent and rude.

Some immediately had a bad impression of Gu Ning.

However, some people, before it was confirmed, didn’t immediately believe it. They still had doubts towards Gu Ning.

“Gu Man, what kind of a daughter do you have? How dare she to hit my daughter?” Gu Qinxiang shouted at Gu Man.

Gu Man was shocked by his shout. In the Gu Family, everyone was afraid of Gu Qinxiang because he was the richest, most powerful and the eldest man in their family.

Even Gu Qinyang, who worked in a national department, respected Gu Qinxiang very much.
