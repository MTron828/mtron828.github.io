Chapter 2776: I’m Happy

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

When Zhan Zhiyin arrived at the inpatient department, she saw Leng Shaoming standing there alone at the gate watching in her direction.

At that moment, Zhan Zhiyin somehow felt like crying.

Seeing Zhan Zhiyin walking back, Leng Shaoming immediately walked towards her. Zhan Zhiyin avoided him a little, because she was still worried that he might disdain her.

Leng Shaoming didn’t care about that at all. After reaching her, he directly held her hand and said gently, “Let’s go back to the ward now!”

This was the first time that Leng Shaoming had ever touched Zhan Zhiyin, so he felt comfortably numb in an instant.

At the same time, his heart was pounding.

“Yeah,” said Zhan Zhiyin, then she let Leng Shaoming hold her hand and they walked back to the ward.

Along the way, neither of them said anything, because they didn’t know what to say.

In the ward, Leng Shaoming asked, “Do you need water?”

“No need.” Zhan Zhiyin answered.

“It’s late now. Why don’t you have some sleep?” said Leng Shaoming.

“Sure,” said Zhan Zhiyin. She took off her shoes and lay down without changing her clothing.

Leng Shaoming also returned to his bed. When he picked up his glass for some water, he noticed the pattern on it was in a different direction. The next moment, he became alert.

Someone had entered this room and moved his glass.

“Someone just came in here,” said Leng Shaoming.

“What?” Hearing that, Zhan Zhiyin immediately sat up in surprise.

“This glass, when I went out, the pattern on the lid was 90 degrees, but now it has changed about 50 degrees, so it has been moved,” Leng Shaoming said.

“Do we need to check the surveillance video to see who has come in?” said Zhan Zhiyin.

“I’m afraid the hospital has been bribed. If we conduct an investigation, it might alert them. I need to call Shaoting first. He has the help of hackers’. We can directly get a hacker to hack into the hospital’s surveillance cameras,” said Leng Shaoming.

“Right.” Zhan Zhiyin nodded.

After that, Leng Shaoming called Leng Shaoting.

At this time, Leng Shaoting was already asleep, but he woke up once his phone rang. He didn’t feel displeased at all.

Due to his status, he had to keep his phone on unless he was in a plane or carrying out a task. No matter who called him, he had to pick it up right away.

Seeing Leng Shaoming’s call, Leng Shaoting thought it was related to Zhan Zhiyin, but it had to be something important since Leng Shaoming called him so late. Therefore, he answered the call at once.

After the call was answered, Leng Shaoming directly told Leng Shaoting about their situation. Without hesitation, Leng Shaoting turned on his computer and hacked into the surveillance cameras in the hospital that Leng Shaoming was in.

Even though Leng Shaoting wasn’t very skilled at hacking, he could get the information he wanted as long as it wasn’t highly confidential.

About fifteen minutes later, Leng Shaoting successfully hacked into the surveillance cameras on the floor of the hospital that Leng Shaoming was staying on. After Leng Shaoming left the ward for five minutes, a female wearing a nurse’s uniform and a mask walked in. Half a minute later, she left.

After walking out of the ward, she went to the washroom. Two minutes later, a woman in a casual suit walked out.

Although she changed her clothes, Leng Shaoting still recognized her. This woman was the nurse.

Afterwards, Leng Shaoting watched the woman leave in the surveillance video.

The woman walked out of the washroom, then went straight downstairs and left. She went to the parking lot and drove out of the hospital in a black car.

Leng Shaoting had to stop there because his abilities were limited, but the information he got was enough for him to find the woman.

Leng Shaoming sent the information to Leng Shaoming who could solve the problem on his own.

After receiving the evidence from Leng Shaoting, Leng Shaoming thanked him sincerely.

Actually, while they had a bad relationship before he wouldn’t turn to Leng Shaoting for help no matter what trouble he encountered.

He found it humiliating to need Leng Shaoting’s help. His pride didn’t allow him to do that. All he wanted was to surpass Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting joined the army afterwards. Leng Shaoming thought that Leng Shaoting wouldn’t be able to have great achievements in the army, but unexpectedly Leng Shaoting was promoted to major general at such a young age. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Now Leng Shaoting was the most outstanding person in the whole Leng family except for Master Leng, and he could be even better in the future.

Leng Shaoming felt that Leng Shaoting could definitely be better than Master Leng as long as he had the ambition.

In other words, Leng Shaoting was qualified to be the Leng family’s patriarch.

However, from his perspective, Leng Shaoting wasn’t ambitious at all. Instead, Leng Shaoting had a strong sense of responsibility.

After receiving the evidence, Leng Shaoming shared it with Zhan Zhiyin. There was no need for him to keep it a secret.

“She must have been sent here by the mastermind. Because you survived, they wanted to try again,” said Zhan Zhiyin angrily. “We must find the mastermind as soon as possible. I must teach him an unforgettable lesson.”

“Ha-ha.” Hearing that, Leng Shaoming snorted with laughter.

“What are you laughing at?” Zhan Zhiyin gave him a glare. She didn’t understand why he was laughing at this moment.

“Well, you’re so mad it seems as if you’re the target,” said Leng Shaoming. He understood that Zhan Zhiyin cared about him and felt touched. However, he still joked about it with her.

“Um, you know I care about you! Don’t embarrass me like that!” Zhan Zhiyin said feeling embarrassed.

“I know, and I’m happy about it. I’m happy that you care about me. And it’s precisely because I’m happy that I can joke with you,” Leng Shaoming said seriously all of a sudden.

“You…” Zhan Zhiyin was surprised when she heard Leng Shaoming’s confession.

At that moment, Leng Shaoming really wanted to hug Zhan Zhiyin tightly, but he didn’t do that because they weren’t girlfriend and boyfriend yet. He didn’t want to leave a bad impression on Zhan Zhiyin.

He didn’t want to scare or upset her.
