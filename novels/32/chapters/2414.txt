Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

In fact, the job wasn’t tiring, and it would only take a bit of energy when they carried out a task. Moreover, every time they finished a task, they would have two days off. However, if they didn’t want to take a break, they could continue to do tasks.

If they worked as martial art consultants, their salary would be lower. As senior security guards, they could have a commotion, while martial art consultants only had a fixed monthly salary.

As martial art consultants, they could make about twenty thousand yuan a month. They would be tired when they were busy, but they would also have a lot of free time when they were quiet. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, Gu Ning felt that Jiang Liluo and Si Jin were more suitable to be security guards. As security guards, they didn’t need to socialize with other people. They only needed to quietly stay beside their employer. And if there was any danger, they would take action to protect them.

As martial art consultants, they needed to communicate with all kinds of actors and other consultants, which wasn’t suitable for Jiang Liluo and Si Jin.

“We definitely don’t mind. We just don’t want to bother you. However, Junior Gu, if you think it’s a good idea, please help us get it done. Don’t worry, we’ll do our best,” said Jiang Liluo at once. Although he asked Gu Ning for her opinion, he actually had no intention of letting her help them find a job, because they hadn’t known that her company might need them, but since Gu Ning could provide them with a job, they were happy to work for her. They didn’t mind it at all!

“Great, there are two jobs that are related to kung fu in my company. You can be security guards or martial art consultants. As security guards, you’ll be hired to protect people. You just need to make sure that they’re safe. You’re not servants, so you don’t need to deal with any personal affairs for your employers.” Gu Ning explained. “Security guards need to protect people and objects. As for your pay, we can split it 50/50, but you must take half of the responsibility if any accidents happen.”

“The second job is as a martial art consultant, you know shooting, right?” Gu Ning asked. She asked them whether they knew how to first. If they knew, she wouldn’t need to teach them in detail. Otherwise, she would need to make an introduction.

“Yeah, we know,” said Jiang Liluo and Si Jin.

“When we’re shooting an ancient show, there are a lot of action scenes. Normally, actors aren’t experts at martial arts, so they need guidance. You can teach them, but I personally think being a security guard is a better job for you. You can have a higher salary as well. Nevertheless, it’s still up to you to decide which one you want to do,” said Gu Ning.

“I agree that being security guards are more suitable for us,” said Jiang Liluo. In fact, he was very interested in it.

“Great, after the New Year festival, I’ll help you get it done. During this time, you can learn how to drive first. It’ll make it more convenient for you to do your job in the future,” said Gu Ning. It would be really inconvenient if they couldn’t drive.

“Great, thank you so much!” Jiang Liluo and Si Jin thanked Gu Ning.

“You’re welcome. I’m not just helping you. I’m also hiring staff for my own company,” said Gu Ning with a smile. It was the truth, so she didn’t want them to thank her too much.

Even though Gu Ning said that, Jiang Liluo and Si Jin still felt grateful to her. They said nothing further, because they had already agreed.

Because Gu Ning and the others set off from the city center, it was far from the suburbs. Therefore, when they arrived, Baili Zongyang was already waiting for them.

This was the wilderness, so there weren’t any people in a radius of several hundred meters, and the probability of someone coming was very small.

They stopped their car by the roadside, then needed to walk a kilometer, but it wasn’t really a problem for them.

After parking their car, Gu Ning and the others got out of it and climbed up the mountain.

When they came close, they sensed a cultivator ahead. Without doubt, it had to be Baili Zongyang.

Baili Zongyang thought that only Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning would come, but he sensed three cultivators coming. So he was surprised and thought that there were other cultivators.

However, when he saw people walking over, he was sure that two of them were Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning even though he couldn’t see them clearly.

Only three among the four people were cultivators, so the one who wasn’t a cultivator must be Gu Ning. Who were the other two cultivators?

Baili Zongyang couldn’t figure out their levels, but he felt that they were at a high level. If they were at a low level, he should be able to figure it out easily. They should be as strong as him!

“Hi, Lord Leng, Miss Gu, nice to see you.” When Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting walked closer, Baili Zongyang walked towards them.

“Hi, Zongyang!” Gu Ning called him.

“Nice to see you too, Mr. Baili,” said Leng Shaoting.

“May I know your names?” Baili Zongyang turned to look at Jiang Liluo and Si Jin.

Baili Zongyang wanted to know who they were, but had no intention of finding out their background. He simply wanted to know their names so that he could greet them.

No matter who they were, since they came with Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting, they must be friends.

“They belong to the same sect as us. This is Jiang Liluo, and this is Si Jin. They just came to the mortal world, so I brought them out for a walk,” said Gu Ning.

Since they met, there was no need to keep it a secret.

“Nice to meet you, Mr. Jiang, Miss Si.” Baili Zongyang politely greeted them. He was surprised to know that they were also members of the Kunlun Sect. How many cultivators of the Kunlun Sect still existed?

“Nice to see you too, Mr. Baili.” Jiang Liluo and Si Jin also politely greeted Baili Zongyang.

When they were on their way, Gu Ning had introduced Baili Zongyang to them, so they knew that he was the eldest son of the Baili family in the cultivation world.

He also had the best talent in the cultivation world. It was a different age now, and the magical power was thin nowadays, so it was very impressive that he could reach such a high level at his age.

In fact, even hundreds of years ago when there was thick magical power, it was difficult to reach the Golden Core Stage at the age of thirty.

It was very difficult to cultivate.. Cultivators needed magical power and magical pills to make quick progress.
