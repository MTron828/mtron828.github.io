Chapter 18: Gu Xiaoxiao

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Facing Gu Ning’s warning and promise, Yu Mixi replied with honesty, “Gu Ning, I cherish our friendship.”

Yes, though Yu Mixi was self-abased, she knew what was loyalty. Once she had taken somebody as her friend, she wouldn’t betray.

“Great, I believe you,” Gu Ning smiled lightly. For this time, Gu Ning sincerely took Yu Mixi as her friend.

It wasn’t easy for Gu Ning to trust someone, but as long as she decided to, she would take it seriously.

Gu Ning of course wouldn’t tell her friend everything, but she wouldn’t hurt her friend either. She was always willing to help her friend.

During this morning, Shao Feifei, Yang Yulu, Wu Qingya and Yang Chengjun all glared at Gu Ning with hatred.

Gu Ning knew Shao Feifei wouldn’t give up, but she wasn’t afraid at all. She was different now.

When they had finished morning classes, Gu Ning and Yu Mixi left the classroom. They went straight to the canteen. Fortunately, Shao Feifei didn’t find them any trouble.

But the minute Gu Ning walked out of the teaching building, she was stopped by a girl.

The girl was Gu Xiaoxiao, Gu Ning’s cousin, who was one of the causes of Gu Ning’s “death”.

Though Gu Xiaoxiao wasn’t as pretty as Gu Ning, she had good features, otherwise Qin Zheng wouldn’t have fallen in love with her.

Moreover, Gu Xiaoxiao was from a rich family.

Although the Qin Family has the power and some money, it wasn’t enough.

They needed more money to achieve their goals.

“Gu Ning, I didn’t expect you could survive.” Gu Xiaoxiao’s eyes were full of hatred and unkindness. She had had nightmares for two days after she had witnessed the car accident.

But when she heard the news from Qin Zheng this morning that Gu Ning had survived, her hatred grew deeper.

She had suffered from nightmares for two days, while Gu Ning was fine and healthy. Gu Xiaoxiao couldn’t stand the truth.

Gu Xiaoxiao was a selfish girl who only cared about herself. In her eyes, it was all Gu Ning’s fault.

“If I really died because of that car accident, aren’t you afraid that I’m going to find you as a ghost?” Gu Ning stared at Gu Xiaoxiao with a fake smile on her face.

Gu Ning knew Gu Xiaoxiao must be terrified, and had two terrible days because of the car accident.

Of course, Gu Xiaoxiao didn’t feel guilty at all. She was merely scared.

“You...” Gu Xiaoxiao’s face changed. Gu Ning had hit the point apparently.

Though Gu Xiaoxiao was annoyed, she didn’t want to mention the car accident any more. “Gu Ning, Qin Zheng never liked you anyway. You’re no longer his girlfriend. So please stay away from him, and don’t embarrass yourself.” Gu Xiaoxiao said to Gu Ning.

Gu Xiaoxiao was being proud like she was the winner. She just wanted to hurt Gu Ning. She wanted to see Gu Ning being sad and miserable.

Unfortunately, Gu Ning had already changed. She would not be hurt, but instead felt disgusted.

And in Gu Ning’s eyes, Gu Xiaoxiao was merely a joke.

“I don’t want such a terrible boy like him at all. Only girls like you will find him attractive. Disgusting!” Gu Ning argued.

“What?” Gu Xiaoxiao was surprised. She couldn’t believe what she had just heard from Gu Ning.

She said she disliked Qin Zheng, and even thought he was terrible?

Gu Xiaoxiao wouldn’t believe it.

Gu Ning must be pretending that she didn’t care.

Gu Xiaoxiao responded afterwards, “Gu Ning, keep lying to yourself. Do you really think I’ll believe you?”

“Believe it or not, I don’t care.” Gu Ning couldn’t care less about Gu Xiaoxiao.

Then, she walked away directly.

“You...”

Gu Xiaoxiao was irritated. She wanted to catch Gu Ning and argued back, but had to give up because she was waiting for Qin Zheng.

After a while, Gu Xiaoxiao suddenly realized Gu Ning was a little different now.

In the past, Gu Ning would never argue back. However, she was so aggressive now.

Had her personality changed after the car accident?

When they had walked away, Yu Mixi looked at Gu Ning once in a while. She seemed she had something to say.

“Just tell me what do you want to say,” Gu Ning asked first.

Though Gu Ning actually knew what Yu Mixi wanted to know, she still intended to let Yu Mixi ask out herself.

After a few seconds, Yu Mixi couldn’t help but inquire, “Gu Ning, have you really been with Qin Zheng?”

It was beyond Yu Mixi’s imagination that Qin Zheng would be with Gu Ning. The two were from hugely different backgrounds.

Yu Mixi was curious.

“Kind of. Gu Xiaoxiao wanted to humiliate me, so she let Qin Zheng chase me, then dumped me after two months. She merely wanted to see me being a joke. So I don’t think I really have been with him.” Gu Ning didn’t hide. She told the truth. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“What?” Yu Mixi was shocked. Then she felt aggrieved for Gu Ning, “They’re just a bunch of bullies. How could they do that to you!”

Yu Mixi felt sorry for Gu Ning, and also felt guilty for she couldn’t do anything for her friend.

“It’s fine. It’s an old story. I’m good now,” Gu Ning comforted Yu Mixi.

Yu Mixi took a look at Gu Ning, making sure she was actually good. Then Yu Mixi felt better. “Did, did he take advantage of you?” Yu Mixi asked later.

“No, we even didn’t walk hand in hand,” Gu Ning replied.

Yes, they even hadn’t walked hand in hand, let alone other intimate behaviors.

Qin Zheng never liked Gu Ning. Their relationship was merely a game. Qin Zheng would never touch Gu Ning.

“Great,” Yu Mixi was relieved.

Gu Ning smiled, but didn’t explain further. She thought Yu Mixi was a lovely friend.

When they finally arrived at the canteen, Yu Mixi went to take food, but asked Gu Ning to stay on her seat.

Gu Ning knew Yu Mixi wanted to buy her lunch in case she would eat a beamed bun as usual.

But Gu Ning rejected.
