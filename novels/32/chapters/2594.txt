Chapter 2595: Is Gu Ning Trustworthy?

“Yeah, I relied on my senses to make the choice. Anyway, we can’t dig a hole and check the inside beforehand, right?” said Gu Ning.

“I know, but you’re too fast. I don’t think you are taking it seriously enough. Are you sure you’re done?” Kang Shaojie asked with doubts. He hoped that Gu Ning could be more serious, because a single mountain cost dozens of millions of yuan!

“I’m sure,” said Gu Ning with certainty.

“Great, if so, let’s go right now.” Since Gu Ning was sure of it, there was nothing else he could say. Although he couldn’t accept it, it was Gu Ning’s business. He couldn’t interfere. What if there were really raw jade materials in the mountain?

Afterwards, they left the restaurant and went to the parking lot, then drove to the Bureau of Land and Resources.

When Gu Ning and the others left, the person who followed them was still there. So when they left in a car, he drove after them.

Gu Ning felt that it was better to remind Kang Shaojie about it, but Kang Shojie drove his own car while Gu Ning and the others sat in the car they rented from the hotel. As a result, she could only talk to Kang Shaojie about it after they arrived.

Once they reached the Bureau of Land and Resources and got out of their cars, Gu Ning said to Kang Shaojie, “Mr. Kang, I’m afraid you must be careful these days, because someone’s been following you the entire time.”

Hearing that, Kang Shaojie was scared. Someone was following him?

The next moment, he calmed down and guessed that the person who followed him must have something to do with Kang Yuannan.

After all, Kang Yuannan lost and felt uncomfortable. It was understandable that he was suspicious of Kang Shaojie, so he sent a man to follow Kang Shaojie.

“I will. Thank you so much, Miss Gu.” Kang Shaojie thanked Gu Ning at once. He felt even more grateful to her, because Gu Ning had helped him a lot!

He was very lucky to have met Gu Ning.

After that, they went to the Bureau of Land and Resources and met the deputy director.

The deputy director was also very surprised that Gu Ning had already chosen a mountain. He also felt she didn’t take it seriously enough. However, since Gu Ning wanted to buy that mountain, he wouldn’t stop her.

What if there were raw jade materials inside? He would ruin her business if he stopped her from buying it. Therefore, the deputy director immediately helped Gu Ning complete the formalities.

With the help of the deputy director, within an hour, Gu Ning finished all the formalities and the mountain she chose belonged to her.

However, the mountain was far from the main road, so they needed to build a road before they started digging out the raw jade materials. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Nevertheless, Gu Ning didn’t need to deal with that by herself, because Zheng Peng would handle it.

After leaving the Bureau of Land and Resources, Kang Shaojie said good-bye to Gu Ning and the others. He couldn’t wait to let his father take the medicine.

Gu Ning called Zheng Peng right away and told him that she was in City Rui. If he had time, he should come here as soon as possible.

Zheng Peng was busy with something right now, but it wasn’t important compared to what Gu Ning wanted him to do, so he brought his people over without delay.

The distance between City Teng and City Rui was about two hundred kilometers, so it took a bit more than two hours to arrive, which wasn’t too long.

Zheng Peng wasn’t sure whether there were raw jade materials in the mountain Gu Ning just acquired, but he had great hopes, because it was Gu Ning’s choice.

All in all, he trusted Gu Ning.

…

Kang Shaojie shared the good news with his father after he defeated Kang Yuannan, so his family was aware of the result of their competition.

Although it was just the beginning of their game, at least he won in the first step, so his family felt happy for him.

Madam Kang and Kang Shaojie’s wife didn’t know that he had Gu Ning’s help, so they asked him for details once he got home.

However, Kang Shaojie didn’t have time to tell them the whole story, because he wanted to see his father first.

As soon as Kang Shaojie saw his father, he said, “Dad, I got a special medicine from Gu Ning. She said it can cure nearly all kinds of diseases, including your illness. Even though you can’t necessarily make a full recovery, you can get much better. You’ll be able to live a normal life! I was surprised when she told me that, and couldn’t believe it. So I tried it and it’s indeed effective.”

As he said that, he showed the scar on his shoulder. “See? I just applied some of the medicine to this scar. After two hours, it has faded a lot. It’s enough to prove the unbelievable effect of this medicine. However, I still have some doubts, so I wanted to ask you whether you’re willing to have a try?”

“What? There is such an unbelievable medicine?” Master Kang was amazed and couldn’t believe it either. However, the scar on his son’s shoulder had indeed faded a lot, which was enough to prove the effect of this medicine.

What medicine could cure nearly all kinds of diseases? He would be lying if he said that he wasn’t doubtful, but he still wanted to give it a try, because he was reluctant to lay sick in bed all day long. If he tried it, perhaps he could get better.

“Is the girl called Gu Ning trustworthy?” asked Master Kang. He had never met Gu Ning before, so he didn’t know what kind of person she was.

“Well, we can’t fully trust her, because I’ve just met her, but she helped me defeat Uncle Yuannan. And among the four raw jade materials containing jade, three were chosen by her. She isn’t only the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry, she is also the owner of Colaine. Colaine is so famous that everyone has heard of it. The medicines produced by Colaine have great effects, so I think father, you can give it a try since I also tried it,” said Kang Shaojie.

“She’s also the owner of Colaine?” Master Kang was shocked. Colaine was famous for its effective medicines, and he had heard of it too.

“Are you sure?” asked Master Kang again.

“She told me that,” said Kang Shaojie. At the beginning, he believed it, but now he doubted it after his father asked him that question.

“Check it out on the Internet,” said Master Kang. He wanted to make sure of Gu Ning’s identity so that he could be more relieved.

If Gu Ning was really the owner of Colaine, her words would be convincing. Even if this medicine couldn’t cure his illness, it wouldn’t be harmful.
