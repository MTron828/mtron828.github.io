Chapter 573 Zhang Yongjun And Zhang Yongjian

Leng Shaoting was also worried about Gu Ning, but he chose to trust her. Moreover, once Gu Ning made up her mind, nobody could change her decision.

“Don’t worry. I’ll be fine,” Gu Ning said.

“Fine.” Tang Yunfan didn’t insist. “Be careful!”

“I will,” Gu Ning said.

When Leng Shaoting drove his car away, Gu Ning got in the leading hoodlum’s car, then she called Tang Haifeng and told him that everyone was safe.

Hearing that, all the members of the Tang family were relieved.

“Oh, your Uncle Tang is awake, and he left to search for your mother,” Tang Haifeng said.

“I’ve met him, and we were just together,” Gu Ning said.

“Great,” Tang Haifeng said. “Do you know who abducted your mother?”

“I’ll tell you when I get back,” Gu Ning said.

“OK,” Tang Haifeng said.

Twenty minutes later, the leading hoodlum brought Gu Ning to a warehouse, and called Zhang Yongjun as Gu Ning ordered.

A middle-aged man was reading in the study on the second floor of a house. Right at this moment, his phone rang. Seeing the caller’s name, the man answered in a hurry. “How is it?”

“Hi, we’ve caught them,” Hong Fen, the leading hoodlum, said.

“Very well, I’ll be right there,” the man said, then hung up. After that, he didn’t leave right away, but used another phone to make a call. “How is everything going?”

“We’re still searching.”

“Great, meet me at the eastern warehouse in 20 minutes,” he said. After that, he walked out of the study going down to a basement. In the basement, there were piles of groceries, but in addition to groceries, there was a man tied to a chair, with two tall bulky men standing by his sides.

The middle-aged man looked at the man who was tied to a chair with an evil expression on his face. “Zhang Yongjun, you should pay for what you’ve done today.”

It turned out that this middle-aged man wasn’t Zhang Yongjun, the man who was tied to a chair was.

Zhang Yongjun glared at him, but couldn’t say a word because his mouth was sealed.

The middle-aged man looked at Zhang Yongjun struggling, then laughed with pride. “Do you want to talk? Well, since you’re going to die because of me, I’ll let you say your final words,” he said, then removed the seal from Zhang Yongjun’s mouth.

In fact, Zhang Yongjun and the middle-aged man closely resembled each other.

“Zhang Yongjian, I’m your biological younger brother! How can you do this to me!” Zhang Yongjun shouted in anger.

“Oh, my little younger brother,” Zhang Yongjian said with a twisted face, “our parents left everything to you, but I’m their older son and I should have taken over everything, not you.”

What their parents had done left a deep mental scar on Zhang Yongjian’s heart, and he was determined to get what belonged to him back.

“You...” Zhang Yongjun was furious. “Our parents did that because you’re addicted to gambling and you’ll lose every coin in a casino!”

“Their properties should be mine, and I can do whatever I want with them!” Zhang Yongjian raised his voice.

“How come our parents’ properties are yours? They can give their wealth to anyone they want!” Zhang Yongjun shouted.

“I’m their older son, and their properties should be mine!” Zhang Yongjian said.

“It isn’t written down as a law!” Zhang Yongjun argued.

Although normally the eldest son was the heir of a family’s properties, it wasn’t written down as a law. Instead, each of the children had the right to inherit their parents’ properties. In addition, parents also had the right to choose any one of their children to be the sole heir.

Moreover, Zhang Yongjian could have a hundred thousand yuan as dividends every year. Their family business wasn’t very profitable after all, it was just a farm. Their annual income was around four hundred thousand yuan every year at the most.

Zhang Yongjian could have the money without making any effort, but Zhang Yongjun had to run the farm well to gain profits.

“I don’t care. I want their properties!” Zhang Yongjian almost roared.

“You...” Zhang Yongjun was speechless.

“Alright, get him in the car. We need to move now!” Zhang Yongjian stopped talking to Zhang Yongjun, then a tall man lifted Zhang Yongjun up, walking out of the basement. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Twenty minutes later, Zhang Yongjian’s group arrived at the eastern warehouse.

Zhang Yongjian didn’t tell Hong Fen his plan, so he left Zhang Yongjun alone in the car, then walked into the warehouse with two tall bulky men. Zhang Yongjun was tied tightly after all, and he couldn’t escape.

However, when Zhang Yongjian walked inside, there were only Hong Fen and Gu Ning in the warehouse. Besides, Gu Ning, who should be tied to a chair, was sitting on it and seemed relaxed.

“Hong Fen, what’s going on here?” Zhang Yongjian questioned Hong Fen.

Hong Fen was like a sidekick in front of Gu Ning now. If Gu Ning didn’t give an order, he didn’t dare to open his mouth.

“You’re Zhang Yongjun?” Gu Ning asked.

Zhang Yongjian ignored Gu Ning but asked Hong Fen, “Hong Fen, what the hell are you doing?” He realized that Hong Fen had betrayed him, but he wanted to know why.

Gu Ning didn’t mind that Zhang Yongjian had ignored her, then turned to Hong Fen. “Tell him.”

“Well, she’s our head’s friend...”

Zhang Yongjian had hired several members of the Kirin Gang to abduct a friend of their head which, of course, wouldn’t work.
