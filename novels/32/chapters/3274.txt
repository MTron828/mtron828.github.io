3276 Smart or Stupid?

Leng Xiaoyao let her opponent get three questions, or she could have gotten full marks.

It was not only Mr. Yang; other teachers and students also had a deep impression of Leng Xiaoyao. None of them wanted to compete against her.

When Leng Xiaoyao went back to her seat, Mr. Chen complimented her and encouraged her to keep on doing her best.

Zhao Weihao’s gaze fell on Leng Xiaoyao the entire time. However, because they were in a competition, he couldn’t go up and make friends with Leng Xiaoyao right away.

When Zhao Weihao focused on Leng Xiaoyao, Gao Qilu noticed and got angry.

Did Zhao Weihao fall in love with Leng Xiaoyao? Didn’t he say that Gao Qilu was his love? Did he lose interest in her so quickly?

Even if Gao Qilu disliked him, she wouldn’t allow him to like Leng Xiaoyao. She could accept it if he went to chase another girl.

Leng Xiaoyao sensed Zhao Weihao’s gaze, but paid no attention to him.

After the first round, it was almost 12 pm so it was time for lunch. They had a rest at noon, and the second round would begin at 2 pm.

At the same time, the list of participants who successfully went to the second round was announced. Those who were eliminated could leave or stay to watch the rest of the competition.

Although Leng Xiaoyao already tried not to attract too much attention, she still had the highest score in the first round.

All three students from the Experimental High School went into the second round.

As for lunch, they needed to find a meal on their own, so Mr. Chen took Leng Xiaoyao and the others outside.

Right when they walked out of the multimedia classroom, Zhao Weihao went over to say hi to Leng Xiaoyao.

“Hi, Leng Xiaoyao, nice to see you. My name is Zhao Weihao. I saw you at the Yar Circuit last time. You’re incredible at racing! You’re my idol. Can I talk to you for a while?” Zhao Weihao said excitedly, showing his obvious admiration for Leng Xiaoyao.

“Really?” Hearing that, everyone was astonished.

Leng Xiaoyao was skilled at car racing?

That was unbelievable!

People turned to look at Leng Xiaoyao with doubts.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care, she was just surprised that Zhao Weihao focused on her the whole time simply because he had watched her race at the circuit last time.

Anyway, since he was being nice to her, she didn’t mind spending some time with him. Therefore, she smiled and said, “Nice to meet you too. Aren’t we talking to each other right now?”

“Oh, right!” Zhao Weihao put on a silly smile.

Obviously, he doubted Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities.

“Of course, even many professional racers aren’t able to surpass Leng Xiaoyao!” said Zhao Weihao. He was unhappy about Mr. Yang’s acidic words, but he still replied to him.

“Do you mean Leng Xiaoyao has competed against professional racers?” asked Mr. Yang. Even though Zhao Weihao said that Leng Xiaoyao was better than professional racers, Mr. Yang didn’t agree.

A teenage girl might be skilled, but she couldn’t be that skilled!

“Mr. Yang, I told you so. If you don’t believe it, why do you bother to ask and even mock us? If you want to know more about it, go to Yar Circuit. There is a video of Leng Xiaoyao racing on the screen at the square. You can see her skill at a glance.” Zhao Weihao argued straightforwardly. Given his family background, he didn’t need to be afraid of anyone.

Mr. Yang was embarrassed, but he didn’t dare to vent his anger on Zhao Weihao due to his status. Therefore, he snorted and quickly walked away.

Gao Qilu, on the other hand, was very unhappy that Zhao Weihao defended Leng Xiaoyao like that.

When Mr. Yang and the others were gone, Zhao Weihao asked Leng Xiaoyao, “Leng Xiaoyao, can we be friends?”

Friends were different from acquaintances. If they could be friends, Zhao Weihao might be able to do some racing with Leng Xiaoyao one day!

Although he wasn’t skilled, it was his hobby.

In addition, it was a great honor to be friends with Leng Xiaoyao.

Before Leng Xiaoyao said anything, Gao Qilu opened her mouth. “Zhao Weihao, Leng Xiaoyao don’t randomly make friends with other people. Even I was turned down, let alone you. Or is it possible that she treats boys and girls differently.”

Although Gao Qilu sounded to be joking, she was clearly picking on Leng Xiaoyao.

Why did she say that Leng Xiaoyao probably treated boys and girls differently?

Did that mean that Leng Xiaoyao made friends with Zhao Weihao simply because he was a boy? That Leng Xiaoyao only made friends with boys?

In that case, Leng Xiaoyao would become notorious for doing that.

Gao Qilu deliberately said that to separate Zhao Weihao from Leng Xiaoyao.

The other people heard it and turned to look at Leng Xiaoyao. They wanted to see whether she was really that kind of girl.

Zhao Weihao didn’t think much about it. He didn’t think that Leng Xiaoyao was aloof. Instead, he felt that he was a little rude. They just met and he asked to be friends with her, which wasn’t appropriate.

Leng Xiaoyao sneered and said, “Gao Qilu, can you tell me your purpose for making friends with me? Other people aren’t from the Experimental High School, so they know little about you, but I clearly know your character. And, I have many female friends in school. Why are you spreading rumors about me right in front of my face?”

People turned to stare at Gao Qilu with doubt.

Leng Xiaoyao implied that Gao Qilu tried to make friends with her for an unkind purpose. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Was it true?

Gao Qilu panicked a little and got angry. However, she still acted innocent on the surface. “I’m just joking. Are you mad, Leng Xiaoyao? I want to be friends with you because you’re very pretty!”

“You’re joking? Do you think it’s a joke to make fun of a girl’s reputation? Did you do it by accident or on purpose? Are you smart or stupid?” Leng Xiaoyao angrily replied.

“You…” Gao Qilu was displeased.

Onlookers also changed their impression of Gao Qilu.

She really shouldn’t have joked about a girl’s reputation. Did she do it by accident or on purpose? Was she smart or stupid?

Did Gao Qilu seem to be stupid? Absolutely not, so…

Was Gao Qilu jealous of Leng Xiaoyao because Leng Xiaoyao was very pretty?

Onlookers believed that that was the answer, so they started to disdain Gao Qilu. However, due to her status, they didn’t dare to do it obviously.
