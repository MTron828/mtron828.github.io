Chapter 1713: Shameless People

Because she just remembered that on their way here and the taxi driver was also in the car, Gu Ning could only tell the taxi driver to stop the taxi meters away from the parking lot.

Knowing that, Leng Shaoting nodded. “Sure, be careful.”

He knew that Gu Ning could feel the air of a cultivator from afar and she had a pair of Jade Eyes, so there was no need for her to have conflict against the cultivator face to face. Leng Shaoting wouldn’t be worried.

“You should be careful too,” said Gu Ning with concern. She was afraid that Leng Shaoting might run into the cultivator.

“I will,” Leng Shaoting said.

After that, Gu Ning walked forward. When she was near the parking lot, she used her Jade Eyes to carefully scan around it. She didn’t feel any cultivators nor see the man, then she called Leng Shaoting and told him to come over.

The cultivator actually had waited here for Gu Ning for a long time, but Gu Ning was still absent and he needed to deal with something else, so he left later. Coincidentally, when he was gone for five minutes, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting came.

Leng Shaoting’s car was parked next to Gu Ning’s car, so they went to their cars together.

Gu Ning checked the car door at once, because she thought that the cultivator must have damaged it. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She was right, and she easily pulled the car door of the rear seats open.

It wasn’t a surprising result, so Gu Ning wasn’t mad at all. Leng Shaoting, however, was displeased. He didn’t care whether his car was damaged, but it was obvious that the cultivator aimed to hurt Gu Ning.

“Is it because of the cultivator?” asked Leng Shaoting. The cultivator followed Gu Ning for the Jade with Dragon Phoenix Cloud Pattern, and he might believe that Gu Ning put it in the car.

“Yeah, he thought that I left the jade in this car!” said Gu Ning.

“Tolerate it for a while. We can go back to Shengshi Hotel in the southern district for dinner, and I’ll arrange for someone to replace this car,” said Leng Shaoting.

“Great.” Gu Ning nodded.

After that, they drove away.

Because the car door was damaged, Gu Ning could only close it with a rope.

When they drove back to the North Gate, Jing Yunyao sat in Leng Shaoting’s car, while Chu Peihan and others sat in Gu Ning’s car.

“What the hell? Boss, your car door was damaged by someone.” Hao Ran exclaimed once he saw the car door.

“Boss, why did you come back so soon? Didn’t you find out who did that?” asked Chu Peihan.

They were all annoyed, and even wanted to beat the person who damaged the car door.

“It was damaged by the person who followed me. It’s fine, I’ll find him and make him pay for it,” said Gu Ning. She didn’t want money, but she would teach the man a lesson.

“Boss, why did the person do that? Did he think there was anything valuable in your car?” asked Mu Ke.

“Perhaps!” Gu Ning said and changed the topic at once. “Oh, do you want to have fun together tonight or stay in the hotel? I already told the show director that you’ll be there before 9 am tomorrow. So you need to get up at 7 am tomorrow and leave for the filming set at 7:30 am. Hengdian World Studios is a little far and you’ll certainly be caught in a traffic jam during rush hour.”

“I think we should stay in the hotel today. I’m a little tired after walking around for a whole day. If we continue to have fun tonight, I’ll be out of energy tomorrow,” said Chu Peihan. Although she could only play an unimportant role, she cared about it.

Hao Ran, Chu Peihan, and Zhang Tianping would join the show, while Mu Ke and Yu Mixi would watch aside. They weren’t good at acting and felt embarrassed to do it too. Therefore, they decided to rest after having dinner.

Chu Peihan and Yu Mixi would go back to Century City with Gu Ning, so they had to get up earlier than the boys tomorrow.

...

Leng Shaoting already booked a private room before they arrived at Shengshi Hotel, so they directly went to it afterwards.

When they finished dinner, the boys went back to their room, and Gu Ning drove Chu Peihan and Yu Mixi back to Century City. Leng Shaoting went back to Mountain River Garden with Jing Yunyao.

Because Baili Zongyang and his younger sister were in Century City, it wasn’t convenient for Jing Yunyao and Leng Shaoting to stay there. However, shortly after they left the hotel, Gu Ning received Gu Qingyun’s call. Gu Qingyun never had called her after she gave him her phone number until now, so it had to be something important.

“Hi.” Gu Ning picked up the call.

“Ningning, I-I...” Gu Qingyun stammered.

Hearing that, Gu Ning understood that Gu Qingyun must have encountered trouble.

“What happened? Tell me,” said Gu Ning in a domineering tone, and Gu Qingyun felt stressed. He said at once, “M-My girlfriend was deceived by her friend to a bar, and she was forced to stay there by a boy who’s her admirer and a bunch of the boy’s friends. They told me to go over to drink with them. If I win, I can leave with her. If not, t-they’ll rape my girlfriend. Ningning, I honestly don’t know what to do now. Can you help me?”

Although Gu Ning told him to feel free to call her when he needed help, he still felt embarrassed.

“Why is your girlfriend so troublesome?” Gu Ning complained, but she still needed to help Gu Qingyun since he was helpless now. “Where are you?”

“At the gate of our school,” said Gu Qingyun.

“Great, I’ll be there in half an hour,” said Gu Ning and hung up the call, then stopped the car by the roadside.

“Boss, what’s wrong?” asked Chu Peihan.

“My older male cousin’s girlfriend was forced to stay in a bar by a boy who admires her and the boy’s friends. They asked my cousin to drink with them. If he wins, he can leave with his girlfriend, otherwise they’ll rape the girl,” said Gu Ning. There was no need for her to hide it, because they would go there together.

“What? They’re shameless!” Chu Peihan was furious once she heard that. “Boss, are we going to help him?”

“Yes,” Gu Ning answered.

“Great, I’ll beat the sh*t out of their ass!” said Chu Peihan.

Chu Peihan was a girl who had a strong sense of justice, and now Gu Ning’s cousin was in trouble, so she felt that she had to do something.
