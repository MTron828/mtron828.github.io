3096 Try It for Me!

Shen Xiyin was a considerate girl, so she really hoped that her mother-in-law could be considerate too. Even if they couldn’t be as close as biological mother and daughter, she hoped they would be friends and wouldn’t make things difficult for each other.

However, Mrs. An had left a good impression on Shen Xiyin till now. She was only afraid that Mrs. An might change in the future. After all, they weren’t familiar right now and changes could happen.

Anyway, she still wanted to have a good relationship with the An family.

“Oh, Mrs. An, how’s Chenmeng’s condition?” Shen Xiyin asked. Although An Chenjun had told her about it, she felt it was necessary to ask Mrs. An again to show that she cared about An Chenmeng.

“We don’t know. We went to the hospital, but there wasn’t a result. The doctor said all indicators are normal. Perhaps she’s just tired, but I don’t think it’s so simple. Chenmeng said she has been having nightmares every night. Her body is cold and her face is pale,” Mrs. An explained. Upon talking about An Chenmeng’s health, she was very worried.

“What nightmares have Chenmeng had?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“Actually, I’m not sure what nightmares I had, because I couldn’t remember them clearly after waking up the next day. I only know that they were very scary. After I woke up, I was still frightened,” An Chenmeng said. She looked scared when she talked about the nightmares.

“Mr. An, Mrs. An, I have an idea. Please don’t be mad. It’s just a guess and I have a reason for that,” Leng Xiaoyao suddenly said seriously.

Hearing that, Shen Xiyin knew what Leng Xiaoyao wanted to say, but she didn’t stop her, because she was convinced by Leng Xiaoyao given An Chenmeng’s condition.

“It’s fine. You can continue,” Mr. An said.

“I think Chenmeng might be possessed by something evil, because she is always having nightmares these days. Besides, her body is cold and her face is pale, and yet the doctor couldn’t find what’s wrong with her. I know it’s hard for you to believe superstitions, but there are all kinds of unbelievable things in this big world. Science can’t explain that, so we can think about ghosts. It’s better to believe it than to deny it,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Everyone was shocked. An Chenmeng was possessed by a ghost?

Mr. An and Mrs. An didn’t believe it at first, but they were slightly convinced by Leng Xiaoyao’s explanation afterwards.

An Chenmeng also cold sweat from fear and her body trembled a little.

“Actually I’ve experienced something that can’t be explained by science. For example, you should know that I used to be a bad person, right?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Yeah..”

Mr. An and Mrs. An nodded.

“A while ago, my fiancé pushed me to the ground. I passed out and had a long dream. After I woke up, I suddenly became very smart and clear-headed. I can learn everything quickly. That’s the reason why I suddenly became an excellent student from being a bad student. I’m even the top scorer in the monthly test. I wasn’t pretending to be dumb in the past, because that couldn’t last long. I don’t think science can explain what I’ve experienced. So, we can’t jump to conclusions that it is impossible. You perhaps just haven’t experienced it,” Leng Xiaoyao said. In order to convince them, she told them more about it.

Hearing that, everyone was surprised. It turned out that Leng Xiaoyao suddenly became so outstanding for a reason! And the reason was quite unbelievable.

“R-Really?”

It was too strange and unbelievable for them, so it was hard for them to accept it right away.

“There is no need for me to lie to you, because it won’t do me any good, right?” Leng Xiaoyao said.

They agreed with Leng Xiaoyao.

“What should we do if Chenmeng is really possessed by a ghost?” Mrs. An asked in panic. If it really happened, how to solve the problem?

“In fact, I’ve been studying metaphysics recently and I’ve learned some skills. Perhaps I can help Chenmeng get rid of the ghost. Would you let me try? Don’t be worried, I won’t let Chenmeng be in danger, but please keep it a secret among us,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Leng Xiaoyao knew the black arts because she learned them from Shangguan Yang since she was little, but she wasn’t good at it. The best she could do was drawing Taoist magic figures.

“What?” Everyone was shocked when Leng Xiaoyao said that she could help Chenmeng get rid of the ghost. Looking at Leng Xiaoyao, they felt they barely knew her and she wasn’t like a normal person.

“I trust you. Please help me!”

Before Mr. An and Mrs. An said anything, An Chenmeng spoke.

She didn’t fully trust Leng Xiaoyao, and mainly wanted to have an exciting experience. Besides, she was suffering from terrible nightmares.

“If so, please give it a try, Miss Leng.”

Since An Chenmeng agreed and Leng Xiaoyao promised to keep An Chenmeng safe, they were willing to try it as long as there was hope.

“Great, I need to prepare some things. Miss Shen, can you go with me?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Of course.”

Shen Xiyin left with Leng Xiaoyao.

“Miss An, let me drive the car, because I need to tell you something. You might be too scared to stay calm,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Although she didn’t have a driver’s license, normally the traffic police wouldn’t ask to see it. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“No problem.” Shen Xiyin agreed. She was also afraid that she might lose control due to getting a fright.

Afterwards, Leng Xiaoyao became the driver, while Shen Xiyin sat in the rear.

When they were far away, Leng Xiaoyao said, “Miss Shen, what I’m going to tell you might offend you. Please don’t be mad. I don’t want to make it difficult for you. I just need to figure something out in order to solve the problem.”

“Miss Leng, you can ask me whatever you want to know,” Shen Xiyin said. She felt Leng Xiaoyao might have some misunderstandings about her.

“I heard from Chenmeng that you gave the jade pendant to her? Can you tell me where you got it?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.
