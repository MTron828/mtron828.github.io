Chapter 427 Get in Trouble

They didn’t stay in the game room for long, and it was just 9:30 pm when they left. Gu Ning proposed to have some fun in the casino since it was still half an hour before the boxing match began.

Since Gu Ning wanted to go there, the other two wouldn’t disagree.

When they walked into the casino, Gu Ning went to exchange ten thousand chips first, then went to the Sic bo[1] table.

The banker was shaking the dice cup, saying something like “hands off the table once you place your bet”.

There were many types of Sic bo, basically “Big”, “Small”, “Alls”, “Odd” and “Triples”.

As for the betting odds, “Big” and “Small” were 1-1, while “Alls” were 1-24. “Odd” could be 1-1, 1-2 or 1-3, according to how many numbers on all three dice the player correctly bet on. “Triples” meant that a specific number would appear on all three dice, and the odds were 1-150.

When the dice cup fell on the table, Gu Ning didn’t place her bet until she used her Jade Eyes to see the numbers on the three dice.

Gu Ning bet on “Odd” with all the ten thousand chips, and she won the bet. The odds were 1-3, so she won thirty thousand yuan.

Everyone looked at Gu Ning with surprise, because she was so lucky!

The second time, Gu Ning also bet ten thousand on “Big”, and the odds were 1-1. The third time, Gu Ning deliberately lost the bet. The fourth time, Gu Ning bet forty thousand yuan on “Odd” again and won a hundred and twenty thousand yuan. The fifth time, Gu Ning lost the bet on purpose once more. She only lost ten thousand yuan. The sixth time she bet twenty thousand yuan on “Triples” and the numbers she bet on were three sixes.

Once the result was uncovered, there were precisely three sixes on it. People around the table were all astonished. The odds were 1-150 so Gu Ning made three million yuan!

Let alone people around the table, even the banker was quite amazed. He wondered whether Gu Ning was just lucky, or if she was actually cheating. Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai almost screamed in excitement. They were excited not because Gu Ning was continuously winning a lot of money, but because of Gu Ning’s unusual luck.

Gu Ning kept betting, and many people started to follow her. However, Gu Ning intentionally lost the following two rounds, and those who tried to follow Gu Ning and make a fortune unexpectedly lost.

“What the hell? Are you doing this on purpose?”

“Exactly! When we didn’t follow you, you won. Once we followed you, you lost. What do you mean by this!” Some were swearing.

Gu Ning was displeased and coldly looked to them. “It’s none of your business how I bet. I didn’t tell you to follow me.”

They were scared by Gu Ning’s terrifying look. To their astonishment, this young girl’s look was so sharp. And it was still unknown to them whether Gu Ning was losing the bet on purpose.

After that, a new round began. This time, Gu Ning told Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai to follow her. There were many people in this casino, and few knew that the three of them were a group.

Meanwhile, those who had followed Gu Ning gave up this round, because they weren’t sure whether it was a loss again. However, Gu Ning won the bet. It was “Triples”.

Each of the members in Gu Ning’s group bet twenty thousand yuan, and won three million yuan.

Everyone started to discuss the result again, but none of them could blame Gu Ning, because it was their own decision not to follow her.

At the same time, in a lounge on the top floor of the Earth Nightclub, a man who was around 30-years-old was lazily lying on the sofa with his legs crossed. The tight, black pants accentuated his long, strong legs, and he only fastened two buttons of his shirt. The man was handsome with beautiful features and looked flashy.

At this moment, the manager of the casino was standing in front of him reporting what had just happened downstairs. The man pulled the corner of his lips and smiled a little, but the manager felt as if he was being threatened.

Gu Ning and the others won around thirty million yuan in total before they stopped, because none of them wanted to annoy the Kirin Gang.

Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai agreed with Gu Ning that it was better to leave after they had won so much. However, what they didn’t know was that they were already in trouble. Right when they walked to the counter and asked to exchange the money, the manager of this casino stopped them. “Miss, our boss invites you to have a round of gambling with him.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Your boss?” Gu Ning raised her eyebrow. Unexpectedly, they had already attracted the attention of the Kirin Gang, but she didn’t know whether the boss was the one who ran this entertainment place in public, or the real boss from the Kirin Gang. Is it possible that the head of the Kirin Gang will show up? Gu Ning thought to herself.

“Ningning.” Both Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai were worried, but they weren’t afraid, because the Cao family and the Tang family were the top influential families in City B. The Kirin Gang should know how to handle it, but what if an accident happened?

“What if I say no?” Gu Ning asked.

“Without our boss’s permission, you can’t exchange the money with these chips.” The manager threatened.

Hearing that, Gu Ning was displeased and said acidly, “I don’t care. It’s merely thirty million yuan. Since your boss can’t afford the loss, why did he open this casino? Just take the thirty million yuan as a tip I give him.”

Gu Ning wasn’t scared at all, but obviously they had nothing good planned, and Gu Ning was concerned that Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai might get involved in trouble.

“What?” The manager was shocked. To his astonishment, Gu Ning would casually dump the thirty million yuan. However, no matter what, Gu Ning had to go upstairs to meet his boss. Otherwise, he would be punished. Therefore, he threatened again. “Miss, if you refuse to meet my boss, I’m afraid that you won’t be walking out of the doors of the Earth Nightclub!”

“You...” Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai were mad. They wanted to argue with the manager or show him their real identity, but was stopped by Gu Ning.

“Very well. You have successfully aggravated me. I will meet your boss. And you... I’ll come to you later.” Gu Ning put on an evil smile, and sharply looked at the manager. The manager was frightened. He had no idea that Gu Ning would be so powerful at such a young age. It seemed that he had annoyed someone he shouldn’t have. However, no matter how unkind she was could she be more violent than the Kirin Gang? Thus, although the manager felt threatened by Gu Ning’s look he didn’t take her seriously.

“Follow me. Don’t say, or do anything. Trust me. We’ll leave here safely,” Gu Ning said to Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai. She didn’t let them leave before her because she was worried that the Kirin Gang would capture them even if they weren’t in the Earth Nightclub anymore. In that case, it was better if they remained by her side.
