Chapter 2851: They’ve Offended You?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Oh, the Kang family heard what happened today, and they will do their best to help,” said Zheng Peng.

“Great.” Gu Ning answered. The Kang family agreed to help because they were grateful.

However, even if the Kang family helped them out of gratitude, Gu Ning still needed to buy Kang Shaojie a meal to thank him. It was her way.

Anyway, since they came, the police and the Kang family should stop the investigation for the time being or those thieves might hide.

Once they arrived at the city center of City Rui, they went to eat first. After they finished their meal, they would go to the construction site.

Unfortunately, they ran into Chen Weiming in the hall the moment they walked into a restaurant.

Chen Weiming had sexually harassed Gu Ning when she came to City Rui last time, and had been taught a lesson.

Because it happened a long time ago, Chen Weiming had almost forgotten about it, but he suddenly remembered it as soon as he saw Gu Ning.

He didn’t feel mad, instead he subconsciously felt afraid and stepped back at once.

Seeing that, Gu Ning felt amused and Chen Weiming realized that his reaction was a little amusing. She totally forgot about it, but he remembered it clearly.

Anyway, it was over and Gu Ning wouldn’t bother to argue about it again. After all, it wasn’t a big deal, and she didn’t suffer a loss.

She just hoped that Chen Weiming would stop causing trouble.

“What are you laughing at?” Chen Weiming asked in humiliation. He felt humiliated by his own reaction, but he didn’t dare to vent his anger because Leng Shaoting was next to Gu Ning.

“I just feel like laughing,” said Gu Ning.

The people who were with Chen Weiming weren’t the same people as before, so they didn’t know Gu Ning, but they were stunned by her beauty.

Therefore, they didn’t notice Chen Weiming’s reaction, and felt that they might know each other after hearing their conversation.

One man’s eyes lit up and he asked right away. “Mr. Chen, do you know each other?”

“Not at all,” said Chen Weiming. Although they had met twice, they weren’t familiar.

Gu Ning smiled, then walked away.

“Hey, miss.”

Watching as Gu Ning walked away, one man followed to stop her. He didn’t seem unkind, but his lecherous look implied that he had no good intention either.

However, before he got close to Gu Ning, Leng Shaoting blocked his path and coldly stared at him. “What do you want?”

The man felt stressed in front of Leng Shaoting and suddenly didn’t know what to say.

Afterwards, Leng Shaoting held Gu Ning and walked away, closely followed by Zheng Peng.

“Jesus, he’s so powerful!” When Leng Shaoting and the others walked away, the man started breathing normally. He took a deep breath, but still felt frightened.

“Don’t mess with them. They’re not easy to take advantage of, or I would have done that early on,” said Chen Weiming. Thinking of what had happened last time, he still felt reluctant to accept the result, but he could do nothing about it, because he couldn’t defeat Gu Ning.

“Have they offended you before?” a man asked curiously. At the same time, he felt extremely surprised. He couldn’t believe that anyone dared to bully Chen Weiming in City Rui.

Most importantly, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were strangers so he didn’t think they were born in rich families.

“Alright, no need to talk about that. Let’s go.” Chen Weiming didn’t want to talk about it. It was so humiliating, and he didn’t want to make himself a joke!

Because Chen Weiming didn’t want to talk about it, they didn’t dare to ask further. However, they understood that Chen Weiming must have been humiliated before. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

After thinking for a while, they suddenly remembered that Chen Weiming had been injured in a fight a while ago. Did the cold man injure Chen Weiming?

Even though they had that thought, they didn’t ask about it, because it would add insult to Chen Weiming’s injury.

Actually, it was Gu Ning who injured Chen Weiming, but because Gu Ning was a girl, those men didn’t think she could do it. They believed it must have been Leng Shaoting who injured Chen Weiming.

…

While they were having a meal, Zheng Peng called the policeman who was in charge of the theft case. He told the policeman about the situation, so the policeman agreed to stop investigating for the time being.

After that, he called Kang Shaojie.

Why did Zheng Peng make the calls, instead of Gu Ning? Because Kang Shaojie called Zheng Peng, not Gu Ning, so this time, it was better for Zheng Peng to call him back.

Once Kang Shaojie heard that Gu Ning was in City Rui, he asked Zheng Peng whether it was convenient for Gu Ning to answer his call. Zheng Peng then told Kang Shaojie to wait for a while.

Gu Ning heard their conversation, so she directly reached out her hand to Zheng Peng to take his phone before he could even ask her about it.

Kang Shaojie asked to talk with her, so it would be impolite if she refused to answer his call. Anyway, it was just a call, it was not a big deal.

“Hi, Mr. Kang, this is Gu Ning,” said Gu Ning.

“Hi, Miss Gu, are you in City Rui now? I’m so sorry that I wasn’t much help,” said Kang Shaojie, feeling guilty.

“Don’t say that. I should thank you for helping me!” said Gu Ning.

“Well, Miss Gu, you did me a big favor first, so I now have a chance to help you, but I’m not very useful,” said Kang Shaojie.

“I helped you for my own benefit,” said Gu Ning. It was an undeniable fact.

“But you still helped me a lot.” Kang Shaojie said, “Alright, we don’t need to talk about that. Miss Gu, are you free tomorrow? If you have time, can we share a meal?”

“I think I have, but I should buy you a meal instead for helping me this time,” said Gu Ning.

“Miss Gu, I don’t think I was really helpful,” said Kang Shaojie.

“Well, it’s a fact that you stood out to help me, it’s another matter that you weren’t too much help. Mr. Kang, no need to argue with me over that, otherwise I won’t go to see you tomorrow,” said Gu Ning, pretending to be mad.

“Well, if you say that, I guess I have to agree. Ha-ha, see you tomorrow then.” Kang Shaojie stopped arguing with Gu Ning.

After they had a brief chat, they hung up.

Gu Ning and the others had a meal at the restaurant, then went straight to the construction site.
