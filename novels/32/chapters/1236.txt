Chapter 1239 Zhu Yinyin“s Affair with Her Boss

“Yeah, we’ve ordered many kinds of seafood,” Chu Peihan said.“Great.” Gu Ning smiled.

“Ningning, you’re very generous, and we know you don’t lack money at all, so we must dine in a fancy hotel tonight,” Chu Peihan said.

“I agree,” Hao Ran said.

“Ha-ha, ha-ha,” Qin Zixun laughed.

“...”

Gu Ning rolled her eyes and said, “Fine, it’s up to you, and you’re the boss tonight.”

Before long, the dishes were placed on the table, and they began to enjoy their dinner.

“Where are we going for fun later tonight?” Hao Ran asked all of a sudden.

“The National College Entrance Examination is around the corner now, so you should focus more on your studies,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Hao Ran and the others were disappointed.

Mu Ke complained. “We’ve asked for a day off.”

Gu Ning had been absent for a long time, and they hadn’t had fun together for a long time. Now, since they finally gathered together tonight, they felt like they should enjoy themselves for a whole night.

Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second, then understood them. They had already asked for a day off, so they could enjoy themselves tonight.

“Where do you want to go?” Gu Ning asked.

“Let’s go to sing tonight!” Su Anya proposed.

“No problem.” Gu Ning agreed.

...

While Gu Ning was enjoying seafood with her friends, Jiang Ze found out many details about Zhao Fulin’s family from a schoolmate.

It turned out that Zhao Fulin was from a very rich family with over a hundred million yuan in assets. In other words, Zhao Fulin’s family was much richer than Zhang Yanni’s family.

Although Zhang Yanni’s family was already much better than Jiang Ze’s family, Jiang Ze felt her family was nothing now compared with Zhao Fulin’s family.

Zhao Fulin kept a low profile and she didn’t wear designer brands, so not many people knew her family background.

Jiang Ze was highly regretful now. He couldn’t believe that he had rejected Zhao Fulin for Zhang Yanni.

Besides, their schoolmate also told Jiang Ze that Zhao Fulin was a very kind girl with good manners.

Jiang Ze felt utterly terrible afterwards, and believed that Zhang Yanni must have deceived him. It was Zhang Yanni who told him that Zhao Fulin was an evil and unkind girl who came from a poor family. However, the truth was the exact opposite.

Jiang Ze was angry that Zhang Yanni cheated him as if he was an idiot.

He wasn’t dumb and soon figured out why Zhang Yanni did it.

Although he ached to argue with Zhang Yanni right now, he still curbed his anger. He decided to get Zhao Fulin back before he went to question Zhang Yanni. After all, he was unwilling to lose both of them at the same time.

Jiang Ze called Zhao Fulin again and hoped that she would pick up his call. Unfortunately, he couldn’t get through to her.

Jiang Ze was left no choice, so he borrowed his schoolmate’s phone. Zhao Fulin didn’t know that it was Jiang Ze, so she answered the call.

“Hi, Fulin, this is Jiang Ze. I have something really important to tell you. Can you meet for a while? I promise I won’t waste much of your time,” Jiang Ze said and sounded sincere. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Zhao Fulin, on the contrary, was unhappy to hear his voice. “There is nothing I want to talk about with you. Stop calling me!”

After that, she hung up on him without hesitation. Actually, Zhao Fulin still felt very sad, because she had really liked Jiang Ze before.

Jiang Ze was angry when Zhao Fulin hung up on him, but he had to calm himself down and called Zhao Fulin once more.

Zhao Fulin refused to answer it, knowing that it was Jiang Ze.

When Jiang Ze called her again and again, Zhao Fulin directly turned her phone off.

Jiang Ze was furious and couldn’t believe that Zhao Fulin dared to reject him. Since Zhao Fulin was unwilling to answer his calls, he had to wait for her outside her classroom later.

As long as it was good for his future, Jiang Ze wouldn’t give up.

...

Gu Ning received K’s call when she almost finished dinner, and K sent an e-mail to her with everything he found out about the woman.

It turned out that the woman had an affair with her boss, and her boss was already married.

Besides, K found many amorous pictures and videos of them in Zhu Yinyin’s computer.

The photos were quite clear and Gu Ning could see their faces.

Gu Ning was confused about the reason why Zhu Yinyin kept bothering Le Zhengyu since she already had an affair with her boss.

Maybe her boss didn’t mind, or otherwise there must be a shocking secret behind those photos.

Gu Ning only glanced at the pictures and she didn’t watch the videos. It would be quite embarrassing if she watched the sex tape in public.
