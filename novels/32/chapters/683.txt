Chapter 684 Lin Tianyou’s Mother

Onlookers all agreed with Lin Tianyou.

“I hate that kind of woman the most. She’s so self-centered and vicious!”

“Exactly! Does she think that she is the queen?”

“If my girlfriend was so unreasonable, I’d dump her right away.”

“A couple should trust each other in a relationship.”

People were all criticizing Zhao Xiaoxuan. However, Zhao Xiaoxuan didn’t feel ashamed at all, but was mad at them. “Shut your mouths! It’s none of your business. Stop criticizing me, or you’ll be hit by cars!” she shouted at the onlookers in anger.

Hearing Zhao Xiaoxuan’s unkind words, people were all annoyed. Although they did criticize Zhao Xiaoxuan in public, what she had done and said were truly malicious.

“Enough!” Lin Tianyou snapped at Zhao Xiaoxuan, which scared her. “Zhao Xiaoxuan, couldn’t you be kind to others? You’ll pay for what you’ve done!”

After that, Lin Tianyou turned around walking away, leaving Zhao Xiaoxuan and her baggage behind. Zhao Xiaoxuan had already embarrassed him in a public place, and he couldn’t tolerate it anymore.

“Lin Tianyou, come back right now!” Zhao Xiaoxuan panicked, but she hadn’t gotten her baggage yet, so she couldn’t leave. Her suitcase was filled with luxuries she bought from abroad.

Lin Tianyou, however, ignored her. Seeing that, Zhao Xiaoxuan was mad and threatened. “Lin Tianyou, if you dare walk away from me today, we’re done.”

Hearing that, Lin Tianyou stopped for a second, but just for a second, then strode away.

Although he might lose a lot if he broke up with Zhao Xiaoxuan, he couldn’t stand Zhao Xiaoxuan’s temper anymore. She was merely a self-indulgent girl with princess syndrome. In the beginning, Lin Tianyou accepted it for the purpose of taking over the Zhao family’s properties, but now he gave up upon thinking of Yu Zi.

When onlookers saw Lin Tianyou leaving without looking back at all, they all cheered.

“She deserves it!”

“No man wants to marry such a woman and argue with her for the rest of their life.”

“Indeed! She isn’t very pretty after all.”

In fact, Zhao Xiaoxuan wasn’t a beauty, and she also had a bad temper. If it hadn’t been for her family’s wealth, Lin Tianyou wouldn’t have agreed to be her boyfriend.

“You...” Zhao Xiaoxuan was in a rage.

Right at this moment, her suitcase came out, so she picked it up and left at once.

Zhao Xiaoxuan thought that Lin Tianyou would be waiting for her at the parking lot, and he would apologize to her as usual. If so, she would forgive him. However, she was wrong, and Lin Tianyou along with his car was nowhere to be found.

Zhao Xiaoxuan was anxious now, because she really loved Lin Tianyou, otherwise she wouldn’t have hurt her close friend, Yu Zi, to get him. Even though she found out that Lin Tianyou was only willing to be her boyfriend because of her family background, she didn’t mind it at all. All she wanted was Lin Tianyou. She was afraid to lose him, so she always kept a closer eye on him. Once any women approached him, she would argue with him and chase the other women away.

Although she fought with Lin Tianyou many times because of it, Lin Tianyou would compromise in the end. Therefore, she never realized that Lin Tianyou disliked her unreasonable and immature actions. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In addition, she didn’t mean it when she said that she was going to break up with him if he walked away from her today. As long as he apologized, she would forgive him. Nevertheless, he left without giving her a glance, which was totally unacceptable in her eyes.

Zhao Xiaoxuan felt embarrassed to call Lin Tianyou, so she called Lin Tianyou’s mother. She hoped that Lin Tianyou’s mother would help her and tell Lin Tianyou to apologize to her. In that case, she would forgive him, and they could get back together.

“Xiaoxuan, are you home now? Come and join us for a meal!” Mrs. Lin was very happy to receive Zhao Xiaoxuan’s call, because she was very satisfied with her future daughter-in-law.

To be specific, Mrs. Lin was actually satisfied with Zhao Xiaoxuan’s family background, because Zhao Xiaoxuan wasn’t beautiful and had a bad temper. Anyway, Zhao Xiaoxuan didn’t dare lose her temper in front of Mrs. Lin, so Mrs. Lin turned a blind eye to it.

Yu Zi was much prettier than Zhao Xiaoxuan, and she was very gentle. However, she was born in an ordinary family, so Mrs. Lin didn’t want her to be with her son. Mrs. Lin was a snobbish person as well after all.

“Well, Tianyou abandoned me at the airport and drove away!” Zhao Xiaoxuan blamed Lin Tianyou on the phone with Mrs. Lin. She didn’t sound aggressive at all now, but aggrieved. Zhao Xiaoxuan wasn’t dumb, and she knew that she had to please Mrs. Lin if she wanted to marry Lin Tianyou.

“What? Tianyou drove away alone? Did you argue again?” Mrs. Lin was surprised.

No matter why they had argued, Mrs. Lin thought that it must have been Lin Tianyou’s fault.

“Yes! I just asked him whether he still likes Yu Zi because we were watching a video of her just then. I asked him to swear an oath of loyalty to me, but he refused and drove away alone!” Zhao Xiaoxuan said, but didn’t tell Mrs. Lin many details.

“What? Does he still like Yu Zi?” Hearing that, Mrs. Lin couldn’t stay calm, because she hated Yu Zi.

“Xiaoxuan, don’t worry. I’ll never allow them to be together again. You’re the one and only future daughter-in-law of our family. Take a taxi to your home, and I’ll call him right now!” Mrs. Lin said.

“Thanks!” Zhao Xiaoxuan said, then hung up. She was confident that Mrs. Lin would side with her.
