Chapter 2493 They Are Indeed Members of the Jing Family

Right at this moment, Jing Yunyao released some magical power and knocked the young girl meters away.

Seeing that, the woman immediately went to support the young girl, in case she fell to the ground. However, the young girl was still slightly injured inside.

Perhaps because this young girl resembled Jing Yunfei, Jing Yunyao, who could do nothing, chose to stand out. After all, it was not wrong that they wanted to deal with monsters. If they were other cultivators, Jing Yunyao would only stop them and explain it to them, but she couldn’t help doing more when she saw a familiar face.

Jing Yunyao guessed correctly. They indeed had a relationship with Jing Yunfei. The woman was his wife, Liu. And the young girl was his daughter, Jing Bingjie. Looking at Jing Yunyao, Liu and Jing Bingjie were astonished and angry.

They were astonished, not because they recognized Jing Yunyao, but because they didn’t expect someone to stop them halfway.

They were angry because Jing Yunyao stopped them and injured Jing Bingjie. Zhan Zhiyin and Leng Shaoming were surprised to see Jing Yunyao, but they also felt relieved.

“How dare you stop us? You even injured my daughter.” Liu angrily questioned Jing Yunyao. As a cultivator, shouldn’t she help them kill the monster? However, on the contrary, she stopped them.

Jing Yunyao said nothing. She walked towards them in silence. Subconsciously, Liu and Jing Bingjie backed in fear, staying alert.

“What do you want?” asked Liu.

Although she believed that Jing Yunyao wouldn’t attack them because Jing Yunyao would be punished by Tiandaozong if she dared to do so, she was still worried after Jing Yunyao injured Jing Bingjie.

“Nothing, I just want to have a talk with you,” said Jing Yunyao with a vague smile.

“About what? You stopped us for the female monster. Aren’t you afraid you’ll be punished?” Liu asked and threatened.

She thought that Jing Yunyao also belonged to the cultivation world.

Jing Yunyao used to be one of them, but now she wasn’t.

“I’m not from the cultivation world. There is nothing for me to be afraid of, but I know this girl. I won’t let you hurt her.” Jing Yunyao snorted. She didn’t let Leng Shaoming hear her, because he couldn’t know it. She didn’t care whether Zhan Zhiyin heard her, because Zhan Zhiyin should know that she wasn’t a mortal. “What? You’re not from the cultivation world?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Both Liu and Jing Bingjie were shocked. They didn’t expect that Jing Yunyao wasn’t one of them.

They had heard that there were also cultivators in the mortal world, namely Shangguan Yang and his disciples. However, even if there were other cultivators, they thought it would be difficult to meet them.

“She’s a monster, but only her soul is a monster’s soul. Her body isn’t. So, as long as she does nothing wrong, cultivators shouldn’t attack her,” said Jing Yunyao.

Hearing that, Liu and Jing Bingjie were surprised again. It turned out that the girl had a human’s body and a monster’s soul. In that case, they indeed shouldn’t cause her trouble as long as she did nothing wrong.

“You just attacked them for no reason, perhaps because you weren’t aware that she only has a monster’s soul. If so, I can forgive you. Now, you should leave and you should stay away from them.” Jing Yunyao said, “If you refuse, I’m afraid I will have to teach you a lesson.”

“You…”

Liu and Jing Bingjie were mad.

It was their fault that they attacked the girl without knowing that she actually only had a monster’s soul, but Jing Bingjie was injured now. Liu and Jing Bingjie were reluctant to accept that result.

“My daughter is injured!” said Liu.

“So? Do you want to take revenge? You can try if you want to,” said Jing Yunyao. She didn’t feel sorry at all.

“You…”

Liu and Jing Bingjie were angered again. Did they dare take revenge? They wanted to, but they didn’t have the ability to do so.

Jing Yunyao had easily knocked Jing Bingjie away, and Liu could feel that she was much stronger than them. It couldn’t be more obvious that they were no match for her. So they had no courage to take revenge!

“Do you think you can bully us just because you’re at a high level? Do you know who we are? We’re members of the Jing family!” Jing Bingjie couldn’t swallow her anger, so she tried to use the influence of the Jing family.

Jing Yunyao frowned, but she wasn’t surprised when she heard that, because she had guessed about that earlier on.

Although they were members of the Jing family, there was no grudge between them. Therefore, Jing Yunyao didn’t hate them. She just wanted to stay away from them.

If they didn’t mess with her, she would do nothing to them, but she wouldn’t hesitate to fight back if they dared to cause her trouble.

“So what? Do you think I’ll be scared of the Jing family?” said Jing Yunyao disdainfully. She really disdained the Jing family right now.

“You…” Liu and Jing Bingjie were astonished and mad. It was beyond their imagination that Jing Yunyao dared to disdain the Jing family.

Did it mean she was more important than the Jing family or that she just thought too highly of herself?

How influential could a cultivator in the mortal world be?

“Who are you?” asked Liu. She wanted to know more about Jing Yunyao.

“That’s not important. If you want to take revenge, do it now. If not, you should go. I don’t have time to waste on you,” said Jing Yunyao without patience. She wouldn’t tell them who she was.

“You…” Liu and Jing Bingjie were angered by Jing Yunyao once more.

“Since you’re not afraid of the Jing family, why don’t you dare to tell us who you are? Are you afraid that the Jing family will punish you?” said Liu. She was unwilling to leave, so she tried to anger Jing Yunyao.

“Well, it seems that you don’t want to leave. If so, let me help you,” said Jing Yunyao, sounding dangerous. After that, she walked towards them, as if she was going to beat them.
