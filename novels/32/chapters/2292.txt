Chapter 2295: Miao Jingjing Is Missing

“Right!” Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue agreed. They also sympathized with Chu Peihan. Chu Peihan was totally innocent.

“It’s fine. She’s mentally strong and won’t be affected by it. If anything goes wrong, as her friend, I’ll stand up for her.” Seeing that they cared about Chu Peihan, Gu Ning felt touched and comforted them.

Hearing that, they were very relieved. With Gu Ning’s help, Chu Peihan would be fine.

…

Lu Yunyi and the others went to have a medical check in the hospital. Their bodies were fine, but were still painful for the time being.

Lu Yunyi hated Chu Peihan, but gave up the idea of causing her trouble again. Chu Peihan had already told her that they weren’t dating and that she wouldn’t tell Han Chenglin about their meeting. In that case, it was better for her to avoid unnecessary trouble.

Since Lu Yunyi decided to give it up, her two friends said nothing. They were scared of Chu Peihan too.

…

After Zhan Zhiyin went back to City H, Leng Shaoming didn’t lose touch with her. After all, he felt interested in her and felt they could learn more about each other.

However, Leng Shaoming was busy at work, so they didn’t contact each other much. They mainly chatted on WeChat once in a while during the day. And at night, they would chat for a while longer.

Zhan Zhiyin understood that Leng Shaoming didn’t reject her, but it would still take time for him to accept her.

Love was generated over time if they got along with each other. They knew very little about one another right now, so they couldn’t get together so soon. If Leng Shaoming asked her to be his girlfriend right now, she would be displeased.

It wasn’t reliable to quickly get together before knowing each other better.

…

In the following days, Gu Ning went to class regularly.

After three days, people lost interest in the rumor about Chu Peihan and Han Chenglin and it was quickly replaced by other hot topics. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the meanwhile, Chu Peihan was accosted by several other girls, but they were Han Chenglin’s crazy fans this time.

Chu Peihan heavily beat them, and they went to criticize Chu Peihan on the Internet, but it didn’t attract much attention. After all, Chu Peihan didn’t have much fame now.

She might gain some fame after?Life After Life, Legend of Demon Flower?was finished and aired.

Speaking of?Life After Life, Legend of Demon Flower, the shooting was about to begin in a week, when Chu Peihan had the winter vacation.

Because it was snowy these days, it wasn’t the right time for shooting.

…

Although the rumor about Chu Peihan and Han Chenglin gradually lost people’s attention, the topic of Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting was still hot on Weibo. However, there were fewer people talking about them now.

During these days, Gu Ning had met Rong Zechen and Yuan Yilin, but she treated them as if they were strangers. She didn’t even bother to give them a glance and directly walked by them.

When Gu Ning was free, she called Gu Man, Tang Haifeng and her other family members. Because Gu Man was pregnant, she couldn’t have a long chat so they hung up after a few minutes.

Gu Man had been pregnant for about nine months and the estimated due date was about ten days later. By then, Gu Ning should be on winter vacation. Therefore, she would go straight back to City B once the semester was over. She had to be there when Gu Man gave birth to the baby.

Gu Ning originally planned to go to class regularly and leave after the exam was over, but something happened the next day and she had to leave the school.

Miao Jingjing was missing.

That morning, Jing Yunyao went to Xiaoyao Mountain Villa, so she didn’t go to work in the Pavilion of Magic with Miao Jingjing. However, Miao Jingjing was also absent.

Lin had a sudden stomach ache, so she called Miao Jingjing and wanted to ask them when they could come. However, she failed to get through to Miao Jingjing, then called Jing Yunyao instead. Jing Yunyao then learned that Miao Jingjing was missing.

They believed that Miao Jingjing was missing, because it had been an hour since Lin called Jing Yunyao after Miao Jingjing went to work. Normally, Miao Jingjing would arrive at the shop within half an hour. Besides, they had called Miao Jingjing many times, but no one answered, so they determined that Miao Jingjing was missing.

It was possible that Miao Jingjing was missing, because she might have been taken away by cultivators who knew her. Mortals couldn’t abduct her.

Although Miao Jingjing was no longer a cultivator, she was very strong compared to mortals.

Jing Yunyao immediately shared the news with Gu Ning. She knew that a skilled hacker was working for Gu Ning. The hacker might be able to help them.

Gu Ning didn’t know where to look for Miao Jingjing, so she went to meet Jing Yunyao at the flower trading center.

Before long, K had the result, but it wasn’t satisfying.

Miao Jingjing took a taxi to the flower trading center, so she was also here. However, right after she got out of the car at the gate, she suddenly disappeared and the surveillance cameras were broken. They could get nothing from them.

In that case, it could have been done by cultivators, because only cultivators had the ability to break the surveillance cameras so quickly.

Who kidnapped Miao Jingjing?

As soon as Gu Ning heard the result from K, she called Jing Yunyao.

“I told my subordinate to check the surveillance videos. Miao Jingjing reached the gate, but the surveillance cameras were suddenly broken. I believe it must have been done by cultivators,” said Gu Ning.

Although they already guessed that it might have been done by cultivators when they heard Miao Jingjing was missing, they needed to make sure of it.

“I’ll go to the gate to see whether I can find any clues,” said Jing Yunyao. Since Miao Jingjing disappeared at the gate of the flower trading center, that would be the only place they could find any clues.

Once Jing Yunyao arrived at the flower trading center, she sensed the remaining trace of air of an evil cultivator.

If it had something to do with Miao Jingjing’s missing, the abductor must be a cultivator and should be an evil cultivator. Miao Jingjing used to be an evil cultivator as well, so it might be her enemy.

With that clue, Jing Yunyao called Gu Ning right away and told her what she had found.

“I sensed a trace of the air of an evil cultivator. So I bet it has to be an evil cultivator,” said Jing Yunyao. Although she wasn’t hundred percent certain of it, it should be close to the mark.

“An evil cultivator? It should be Miao Jingjing’s enemy.” Gu Ning frowned when she heard that. She also believed that it must be an evil cultivator who had a grudge against Miao Jingjing.
