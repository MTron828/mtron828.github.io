Chapter 279: Are You Satisfied?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“You...” Wang Xinyan was annoyed, but she didn’t dare to say anything now, because Yan Shuya had been practicing kung fu since she had been a kid. Wang Xinyan couldn’t win in a fight against Yan Shuya.

“Let’s leave now,” Yan Shuya said, and pulled Gu Ning, walking ahead. Gu Ning didn’t resist, but followed her. Yan Shuya didn’t stop until they were far away from them. She looked at Gu Ning and thanked her. “Thank you so much for helping me.”

“You had no intention to beat them, but you did it after I showed up. Now they will probably try to revenge themselves on you. Don’t you blame me for that?” Gu Ning asked.

Gu Ning understood that she caused Yan Shuya more trouble, and felt guilty.

“I know that you were just being kind, and I indeed couldn’t tolerate it anymore. I don’t care if they’re going to get revenge on me,” Yan Shuya said airily, but she seemed worried.

Since Gu Ning was already involved, she wouldn’t leave Yan Shuya alone. Gu Ning took out her name card handing it to Yan Shuya. “We have the same enemy. If she really causes you trouble in the future, you can call me. I’ll help you.”

“Thanks.” Yan Shuya didn’t reject, but she wouldn’t bother Gu Ning either.

After that, they separated.

When Gu Ning was finally back in her room, it was almost 12 am. She still hadn’t received a message from Leng Shaoting yet, and she had no idea whether he would be back tonight. Right when Gu Ning was ready to go to bed, her phone rang. It was Leng Shaoting, and Gu Ning answered it at once.

“Open the door. I’m outside,” Leng Shaoting said.

Gu Ning immediately jumped out of bed, running to open the door. She hadn’t realized that she wanted to see Leng Shaoting so badly.

When Gu Ning opened the door, she met Leng Shaoting’s eyes. At that moment, they shared the same excitement, as if they hadn’t seen each other for ages. However, the next moment, Leng Shaoting’s sight fell on Gu Ning’s ample breasts. She was wearing a loose bathrobe and her ample breasts were half bared to the air. Gu Ning flushed and covered her chest with her hands, turning back and running to her bedroom.

Leng Shaoting instantly walked inside and locked the door, following Gu Ning to the bedroom.

Gu Ning jumped into the bed and covered herself tightly with the quilt. She knew that Leng Shaoting was behind her, but didn’t look back.

Leng Shaoting threw the folder in his hands onto the bedside table, and removed his coat. After that, the two shared a passionate night together again. Gu Ning felt so happy and warm Leng Shaoting’s arms. She felt like she already had everything that she wanted in her life.

Thinking of what they had done throughout last night, Gu Ning blushed and beamed. She had to admit that Leng Shaoting’s body was extraordinarily alluring.

Although she felt shy looking straight at him, she couldn’t help giving glances at his body. Seeing that, Leng Shaoting smiled a little and teased, “Are you satisfied?”

Gu Ning flushed more, and immediately moved her gaze away and then Leng Shaoting pulled her into his arms once more. They cuddled together in the bed and didn’t want to get up.

After a long while, Leng Shaoting got up to make breakfast for Gu Ning.

“It’s still early now, and you can sleep for a while longer,” Leng Shaoting said to Gu Ning. She might be exhausted after they had sex countless times.

Gu Ning didn’t move, or get up, because she indeed felt tired. Leng Shaoting gave her a light kiss before walking out. Gu Ning rolled onto her back and fell asleep again. In order to not wake Gu Ning up, Leng Shaoting moved quietly while he was making breakfast.

About an hour later, Gu Ning smelt the pleasant scent of meat, which made her hungry. She woke up at once and got up to take a shower. After a while, she walked out of the bedroom. Leng Shaoting was almost finished preparing the breakfast which consisted of many nutritious foods.

“It’s hard to find a man who can cook nowadays. I think I’m a lucky girl!” Gu Ning complimented him. This wasn’t her first time eating food prepared by Leng Shaoting, so she knew that he was good at cooking. He was even better at cooking than she was.

“As long as you like it, I’ll cook for you every day!” Leng Shaoting beamed.

“Very well!” Gu Ning was of course happy to hear that.

Leng Shaoting was in fact more than willing to cook for the girl that he loved.

After breakfast, Leng Shaoting handed a folder to Gu Ning. All the legal documents that she needed were inside.

“Are you busy today?” Gu Ning asked.

“Nope, I can keep you company today,” Leng Shaoting replied.

“Excellent!” Gu Ning said.

Afterwards, they went out together. However, the minute they walked out of the entrance of the hotel, they were stopped by five policemen with electric batons in their hands.

One of them took out a photo to show it in front of Gu Ning’s eyes and said, “Someone accused you of attacking them, so you need to follow us to the police station now.”

The photo was a screenshot from a dashboard camera, in which Gu Ning’s face was pretty clear so that she couldn’t deny it. Of course, Gu Ning never thought to deny it either.

“Don’t you dare!” Leng Shaoting immediately protected Gu Ning by standing in front of her. His cold glance was as sharp as a knife, and frightened the policemen.

It was impossible to take Gu Ning away from Leng Shaoting’s side.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
