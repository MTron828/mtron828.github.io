Chapter 1656: Don’t Mince Your Words

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Jing Yunyao sighed, because she couldn’t stop herself from trying to get her memories back.

“Why don’t we go home and have a rest?” said Gu Ning. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Thanks, but I’m fine. We can go home after we have the seafood for lunch this afternoon!” said Jing Yunyao and tried to cheer herself up. Although she just passed out, she felt very well now.

“Um, I think we can go buy some seafood and cook at home by ourselves. What do you think?” said Gu Ning.

It was still early, and they would have to drive around for a few more hours if they decided to eat outside before going back home, and Gu Ning was worried that Jing Yunyao might faint again.

“No problem, but I’ll be the cook today, and you can’t compete against me for that,” said Jing Yunyao.

“I can be your assistant,” said Gu Ning.

After that, Gu Ning went to shop for seafood with Jing Yunyao.

Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao went to the largest aquatic products mall in the capital. However, when they arrived at the aquatic products mall, something unpleasant happened

Although there were all kinds of seafood in the mall, not every species was available all the time, especially the rare species. For example, there were only a few red king crabs left now.

Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao saw a red king crab weighing about 10 kilograms. Red king crabs weren’t real crabs. They were mainly distributed in cold waters and were named after their huge size and so were known as “the King of Crabs”.

Since it was the famous “the King of Crabs”, Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao decided to taste it.

A red king crab was much more expensive than other crabs, and this huge red king crab cost them thousands of yuan.

Gu Ning didn’t allow Jing Yunyao to pay for this red king crab, because it was too expensive. Actually, it alone was more expensive than a good seafood meal.

Although Jing Yunyao could afford it, Gu Ning still paid the bill before her. However, right after Gu Ning paid the money for the red king crab, a woman came in a hurry and directly said that she wanted the same red king crab.

Seeing the woman, the owner of the seafood stand looked a little displeased. “I’m sorry, this miss just paid for this red king crab.”

“What?” The woman was upset. “I told you I want this crab, and I just went to look around for a while. Why did you sell it to another person?”

Hearing that, the owner of this seafood stand was angry too. “You said that you want it, but you also told me it’s too expensive. You didn’t pay for it. Why should I keep it for you?”

“I...” The woman was struck dumb for a second, and panicked a little. In fact, she left to search for cheaper red king crabs, but failed. Besides, other red king crabs were smaller, and the lady of their house disliked small crabs.

This red king crab in Gu Ning’s hands was very suitable. If she didn’t go back with a big red king crab, the lady of their house would criticize her, which made her feel quite anxious.

“I’m back now, and I’m willing to pay,” said the woman.

“It’s useless, because it’s sold already,” said the owner.

The woman suddenly turned to Gu Ning. “Hey, you, give this red king crab to me, and I can give you the same amount of money.”

Her attitude was very rude.

“Sorry, but no,” said Gu Ning, disliking the woman’s attitude.

“You...” The woman was mad, but couldn’t do anything about it.

Gu Ning then ignored the woman and left with Jing Yunyao.

They also bought many prawns, fish, shellfish and other seafood. They even bought some food materials for the next two days.

It was only 4 pm when they were back at the house so Gu Ning told Jing Yunyao to have a rest, and that they could begin to cook at 6 pm.

Jing Yunyao nodded.

When it was 5 pm, Gu Ning received a call from Qi Tianlin, and he invited her to share a meal together because he was in the capital now.

Gu Ning told him that she wasn’t available today. However, she could give him a free meal in the Huangdeng Hotel.

Qi Tianlin snorted with disdain, “I don’t lack money for a meal, and it’s not easy for me to come to the capital. I simply want to share a meal with you, and I know you’re living in the capital now. As the host, shouldn’t you invite your friend to have a meal together?”

All of a sudden, he became angry. “Do you think I’m not qualified to be your friend?”

Gu Ning rolled her eyes. “If you really take yourself as my friend, you should understand me. I’m not free today, even though I’m willing to share a meal with you.”

“When will you be free?” asked Qi Tianlin.

“Tomorrow,” said Gu Ning.

“Well, can you come to see me after dinner? By the way, do you have more pills?” asked Qi Tianlin.

Gu Ning laughed. “Now I understand why you want to see me. Don’t mince your words!”

Gu Ning wasn’t being mean, but this was the way they got along with each other.

Qi Tianlin hesitated for a second, then said, “Fine, I need more pills, and honestly you don’t know me very well. I’m not as cruel as you think.”
