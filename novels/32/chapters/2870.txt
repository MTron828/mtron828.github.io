Chapter 2871: Affected by Evil Energy

Officials in the Dai family’s faction weren’t all upright. Some of them were corrupt and had broken the law too. The Yuan family and some other families had found out about it, but what they had done had nothing to do with the Dai family, so the Dai family wasn’t really affected.

Yesterday, Pei Jiangchao was sentenced. Although it was an abduction, it didn’t succeed and Dai Xiongyu wasn’t injured. Therefore, he didn’t receive a serious punishment. He was only sentenced to five years in jail and all of his properties were confiscated.

His properties would be public funds and he also had to pay Dai Xiongyu compensation. The Pei family decided to double the amount of money.

Although it was not really a huge amount for them and it couldn’t do anything, it was still necessary, otherwise other people might think that the Pei family didn’t need to pay a price for their mistakes.

Pei Jiangchao was sentenced to five years in jail, but he deserved it because he broke the law. However, for the victim, that wasn’t something concrete, so he still needed to pay compensation.

Because the Dai family stopped blaming the Pei family for sheltering Pei Jiangchao, they didn’t interfere in the judgment.

Pei Jiangchao understood that the sentence wouldn’t be lighter even if the Pei family interfered, instead the Pei family would have been dragged into trouble because of it. Nevertheless, he still felt hurt that his father and younger brother didn’t help him and even went to apologize to the Dai family in order to get away with it.

He wished that he could have good luck and that he might have a chance, but now he lost everything.

Pei Jiangchao’s wife and kids had the same opinion, so they all blamed Master Pei and Pei Jianghai, but they also knew that it was Pei Jiangchao’s fault, so they didn’t dare to show their feelings no matter how unhappy they were.

…

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t ask about it. The next day when they were back in the capital, Leng Shaoting returned to the military base while Gu Ning continued to go to class.

It was already mid-July at this time, so a few days after Gu Ning came back, the final exams were due. Then they would have a vacation.

Because Gu Ning was out of the school most of the time this semester, she missed many classes. She had a photographic memory, but she still needed to learn beforehand. If she didn’t learn anything, she wouldn’t be able to gain any knowledge even though she had a photographic memory.

As a result, she devoted herself to study for the next few days. She caught up with her classmates and prepared for the exam.

Unfortunately, the afternoon before the exam, an accident happened again.

Dai Xiongyu’s father suddenly got sick and Master Dai ordered to stop attacking the Chang family. It was very abnormal and he even refused to answer Leng Yuanqian’s call.

Once Jing Yunyao heard about that, she felt that it wasn’t simple, so she went to visit the Dai family.

At the same time, she called Gu Ning and asked Gu Ning to go visit Master Dai’s eldest son at the hospital.

No matter what happened, as long as Master Dai’s eldest son was alive, Gu Ning could help them.

After Jing Yunyao arrived at the Dai family’s house, she sensed an evil energy around. She instantly became angry.

Although it wasn’t very harmful, it was enough to affect ordinary people.

However, when she wanted to go in, a security guard stopped her and said, “Master’s order, no member of the Leng family can get inside.”

“What?” Jing Yunyao slightly frowned, but wasn’t surprised, because she realized that something must be wrong the moment she sensed the strong evil energy.

It was possible that the Dai family was being controlled by something evil, otherwise Master Dai’s eldest son wouldn’t have gotten sick all of a sudden and Master Dai wouldn’t have stopped attacking the Chang family. Master Dai even refused to answer Leng Yuanqian’s call and forbade the Leng family to go inside.

That couldn’t be Master Dai’s idea.

However, it was impossible for security guards to stop Jiang Yunyao.

Without delay, Jing Yunyao directly flew over the big iron gate, then quickly walked towards the main building of the Dai family’s mansion.

Seeing that, the security guards shouted at her to stop and chased her quickly.

They could also see Master Dai’s abnormal behavior and knew that it wasn’t right that he forbade the Leng family to go in. After all, it wasn’t a secret that the Leng family had helped the Dai family a lot recently.

Master Dai couldn’t wait to unseat and replace the Chang family, but suddenly changed his mind and stayed away from the Leng family. It was extremely unreasonable.

Nevertheless, that was Master Dai’s order, so they had to obey it.

However, they couldn’t stop Jing Yunyao at all. They could only watch her go in.

When she was close to the main building, she clearly sensed a person covered in evil energy in the room.

Without further thought, Jing Yunyao directly broke into the room.

In the living room, only Junior Mrs. Dai and Dai Xiongyu were present. Senior Mrs. Dai was staying in the hospital with Master Dai’s eldest son. Because Master Dai wasn’t in a good condition, they needed someone who could make decisions at home.

The other family members still needed to go to work.

Junior Mrs. Dai and Dai Xiongyu weren’t surprised to see Jing Yunyao. On the contrary, they expected her to come.

In fact, they both felt that Master Dai’s behavior was very abnormal and unacceptable, but they could do nothing about it. They could only hope that the Leng family would come and help them.

However, they were afraid that Jing Yunyao might not be able to deal with it alone.

“Hi, Mrs. Leng.” Junior Mrs. Dai and Dai Xiongyu greeted Jing Yunyao.

“Hi, Junior Mrs. Dai.” Jing Yunyao politely replied. She was now sure that something was wrong with Master Dai instead of them, and that Leng Yuanqian actually learned about Master Dai’s condition through Dai Xiongyu.

“Mrs. Leng, my grandpa looks very strange. I think he might be affected by something evil,” Dai Xiongyu said, filled with worry.

“You’re right. He’s indeed been affected by evil energy,” Jing Yunyao said in an affirmative tone. This room was full of evil energy, but only Master Dai was affected, while the other people were fine. It was obvious that Master Dai was the target.

Dai Xiongyu and the others were a little affected too, but not seriously, so they behaved normally.

Besides, in addition to the evil energy in this room, Jing Yunyao also sensed it from Master Dai’s study. There was a man inside, and that man was undoubtedly Master Dai.
