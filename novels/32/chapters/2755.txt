Chapter 2757: I’m Aroused by You

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Really? I don’t believe it. Don’t you know men care about that a lot? It’s really important to us. If you don’t know, let me prove it to you,” said Xu Jinchen, fondling all over Zi Beiying’s body.

Xu Jinchen only did that to test Zi Beiying’s reaction. If she could accept it, he wouldn’t fight his desire any longer. If she didn’t want it, then he would just tolerate the torture.

No matter how hard it was, he wouldn’t hurt Zi Beiying. He loved her, so he respected her. If a man didn’t respect his woman, he wasn’t a real man.

“You…” Zi Beiying got nervous. In fact, she was fine with it. After all, they were in a stable relationship right now, and sometimes she even dreamed about them having sex.

She was a good girl, but they were both adults, who were deeply in love, so she couldn’t help thinking about taking the next step.

However, she was scared too, so Zi Beiying didn’t know what to do right now.

“I…” Zi Beiying wanted to say something, but had no idea what to say.

“What?” Xu Jinchen flirted with her. He was still fondling Zi Beiying, but he didn’t touch her sensitive parts.

“Let me go…” Zi Beiying got a little mad from the embarrassment since Xu Jinchen was making fun of her.

“No.” Xu Jinchen insisted, then he hugged her tighter and buried his head in her neck.

Zi Beiying soon stopped struggling. Actually, if she was really mad, Xu Jinchen would let her go. There was no need for her to struggle.

Zi Beiying flushed once more and her heart was pounding. If it was possible, she wanted to run away right now.

“Let me go!” Zi Beiying said again.

“I don’t want you to leave. What should I do?” said Xu Jinchen. He sounded a little helpless. He badly wanted her and was reluctant to let her go. However, he couldn’t force her to have sex with him.

“If you don’t let me go now, you’ll be uncomfortable,” said Zi Beiying. Although she wasn’t prepared to have sex with him, she was worried about him being so uncomfortable.

“Yeah, it’s really uncomfortable. Yingying, can you help me with that?” Xu Jinchen joked in a serious tone. He wanted to see what Zi Beiying would do.

Hearing that, Zi Beiying panicked. She knew what Xu Jinchen wanted. She didn’t hate it, but felt embarrassed to say yes. After all, she was a lady.

She also wanted him, but she wanted him to initiate it because he was the man.

“Go to have a cold bath,” said Zi Beiying.

“It’s summer, but I drank a lot. I could catch a cold if I take a cold bath,” said Xu Jinchen, lying outright.

“What do you want then?” Zi Beiying understood that he was lying, but she didn’t know what to say.

“I want…” Xu Jinchen raised his head to look at Zi Beiying. There was obvious desire in his eyes. Zi Beiying was scared and avoided his eyes.

“I’ll just go have a shower!” Xu Jinchen still didn’t have the heart to force Zi Beiying to satisfy him. He decided to cool himself down. Afterwards, he kissed Zi Beiying, then let her go.

Suddenly, Zi Beiying felt upset. She wanted Xu Jinchen to take the initiative, but she didn’t want to have sex right now.

Xu Jinchen stayed in the bathroom for more than half an hour till he got rid of the desire.

After he walked out, Zi Beiying was already in bed. She wasn’t asleep, but she deliberately closed her eyes when Xu Jinchen came out.

Xu Jingchen came over in his nightgown and lay down on the bed without changing into his pajamas, then he hugged Zi Beiying from behind.

This wasn’t the first time that they had slept in the same bed. They only kissed and hugged each other, and nothing more ever happened.

“Are you asleep?” asked Xu Jinchen.

“Yes.” Zi Beiying answered subconsciously, but once she spoke, she regretted it. If she was asleep, she shouldn’t talk anymore!

“Ha-ha.” Xu Jinchen was amused and laughed out loud. “How can you talk when you’re in sleep?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“It’s my soul!” Zi Beiying was mad.

“Really?” Xu Jinchen was amused once more. “If it’s just your soul, should I do something right now?”

“You…” Zi Beiying was annoyed. “You’re bad!”

“I’m bad? If so, I think I need to do what a bad man does,” said Xu Jinchen.

“Move!” Zi Beiying pushed him in anger, but Xu Jinchen wouldn’t let her go. After a while, the clothes on their bodies were loose.

Zi Beiying flushed and withdrew her hands. Without delay, she got up, wanting to run away.

She had a feeling that Xu Jinchen would lose control if she stayed with him for a moment longer.

Right as Zi Beiying got up to leave, Xu Jinchen pulled her back and pressed her against the bed.

“W-What do you want to do?” Zi Beiying was too scared to finish a sentence. She rounded her eyes, staring at him.

“You aroused me, so you must take responsibility.” Xu Jinchen gradually let his desire get the better of him. It was really difficult to fight it and he couldn’t wait to release it.

“I…” Zi Beiying was struck dumb. She didn’t know what to say at this moment. She understood that it was painful when a man was aroused.

Zi Beiying hoped that Xu Jinchen would use some force to persuade her and she wouldn’t push him away this time.

“Beiying, what if I lose control? Will you hate me if I’m a little rough?” Xu Jinchen curbed his desire, looking straight at her and asked carefully.

When he had reason, he could control himself, but he was afraid that he would lose control at any moment.

“I-I don’t know…” Zi Beiying’s heart was pounding, so she turned her head to the side to avoid Xu Jinchen’s eyes.
