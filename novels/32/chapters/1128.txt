1129 Take Gu Ning Lightly

Once Gu Ning walked out of the house, she called K and told him what had happened before he went to get the surveillance videos she wanted.

After that, Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting about the conflict she had with Leng Shaojia in Charm that morning, because she had a strong suspicion that Leng Shaojia was involved in this. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

She didn’t want to tell Leng Shaoting about her, but he was a member of the Leng family too, so she thought that it was necessary for him to be aware of it.

Leng Shaoting was displeased after knowing what had happened to Gu Ning. Normally, he wouldn’t bother to punish Leng Shaojia no matter how unkind she was towards him. However, since Leng Shaojia began to make things difficult for Gu Ning this time, he couldn’t ignore it anymore.

If Gu Ning needed his support, he would give her unconditional support. Besides, Gu Ning wasn’t someone Leng Shaojia could mess with. Even though Leng Shaojia was related to him, Gu Ning was more important in his eyes.

It wasn’t the peak time for traffic, so Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning arrived at the shopping mall about 20 minutes later.

They parked the car in the underground parking lot, then went to the store at once. Therefore, it only took Gu Ning half an hour to get to the store after she received Yu Zi’s call.

Yu Zi and the other staff members were all waiting for her.

The woman and those reporters she had bribed stayed too. Most of the customers in the store were also curious to know the result. They cared about it, because they were potential buyers of Charm gowns.

K soon sent four videos back to Gu Ning.

In the first video, the woman handed each of those reporters a thick red envelope. In the second video, the woman went to buy a dress in Charm store, then left.

Although this video wasn’t useful, K still sent it to Gu Ning.

In the third video, the woman cut the dress with scissors in a car not far away from the shopping mall. In the fourth video, the woman went back to Charm store along with a group of reporters.

Gu Ning knew that it was a trap, so she wasn’t surprised after watching the four videos.

Because it was an emergency, K only found the four surveillance videos. As for the woman’s identity and the reason why she did it, K would keep on investigating later.

At the same time, some reporters already posted articles and photos on social media accusing Charm of quality problems.

Within a short time, Charm was amid criticisms.

Although Gu Ning had many fans, there were a lot of haters on the Internet as well, and they seized this chance to attack her and Charm.

A while later, Gu Ning’s fans found out about it and began to defend her on the Internet.

Those reporters actually didn’t know much about Gu Ning’s influence, so they had no idea that they were in trouble now.

All in all, most Internet users chose to believe Charm and Gu Ning. It could be an accident that the low quality dress was mixed with high quality dresses.

The garment factory was very large, and there were many production lines, so it was understandable that accidents happened sometimes.

Even international brands could make mistakes, and it wasn’t a serious problem.

Some Internet users thought the woman was making a big fuss over a minor issue, because she only found one dress which wasn’t good enough.

Others also believed that it could be a trap laid by a competitor in business, and the woman could be working in the clothing industry too. It wasn’t an uncommon thing to see in the business after all.

If it was the truth, many Internet users would gloat over the woman’s failure, because they all knew how powerful and influential Gu Ning was. It wasn’t a smart decision for the woman to cause Gu Ning trouble.

...

When Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting arrived, they attracted a lot of attention from people around them, because they were too noticeable to be ignored.

“Hi, boss!” Yu Zi walked to Gu Ning at once.

When other people heard Yu Zi call Gu Ning her boss, they were surprised. They didn’t expect that the boss of Charm was a young girl.

The woman rolled her eyes at Gu Ning, because she believed that it was very easy for her to handle a young girl. In addition, she didn’t know Leng Shaoting, so she wasn’t afraid of him at all.

Once Gu Ning showed up, those reporters turned to ask her questions.

“Miss, are you the boss of Charm?”

“Can you give us a reasonable explanation for the quality problems of Charm?”

“Miss, why are the prices of Charm gowns set so high?”

“...”

“Please be quiet for a moment, and I promise I’ll give you a satisfactory answer after I figure out what has happened here,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, those reporters became quiet and waited for Gu Ning’s explanation.
