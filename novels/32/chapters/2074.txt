Chapter 2076: Just Felt There Was

In the misty forest, they walked deeper together, but would rarely meet each other because they didn’t walk in a straight line; just in a rough direction. As a result, it could be a bending route.

Although they would rarely see each other, some of them still met by accident. When Dongfang Ziyu’s team saw Jing Yunyan’s team, they avoided one another under a tacit agreement. The two teams were at the same level, so they avoided having conflicts, at least for now.

In addition to meetings with people, they would also see many demonic monster corpses. Whenever they saw the bodies, they would go to observe them. They did that, not because they tried to find missed demonic monsters, but simply because they wanted to figure out how many demonic monsters from among them had magic crystals so that they could be mentally-prepared.

Demonic monsters with magic crystals were different from those without, so they could distinguish them by a glance even though the magic crystals were already taken away.

Anyway, most of the demonic monsters they saw didn’t have magic crystals. Even if there was, it was just a magic crystal at the first or second level.

After a while, Dongfang Ziyu’s team noticed bodies of three fourth-level demonic monsters. Among them, two had magic crystals, which greatly surprised them. At the same time, they became worried.

“There are two with magic crystals among these three demonic monsters. Whoever met them was very lucky!” Wu Shunhua exclaimed.

“Right, we haven’t got any fourth-level magic crystals yet!” His teammate chimed in.

“I wonder who got this fourth-level magic crystal,” said another teammate, trying to figure out who was most likely to have done that.

“It can’t be Jing Yunyan or his teammate. We just met them in another direction. I feel it might be Shangguan Yang’s disciple,” said Wu Shunhua. There were more cultivators at a high level than just them, but he had a feeling that it could be Shangguan Yang’s disciple.

Dongfang Ziyu also had that idea. They were the biggest threat to her after all!

At this moment, she felt a serious crisis.

“No matter who it is, they already have two fourth-level magic crystals, so we’re in a very dangerous situation. Let’s move now!” said Dongfang Ziyu.

Hearing that, her teammates agreed and they continued to walk ahead.

Five hours later, all the participants only had three hours left. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting took Mo Qilin to a deeper area of the forest and they already met fifth-level demonic monsters.

Before that, they had successfully gotten eight fourth-level magic crystals, six third-level magic crystals, six second-level magic crystals, and a first-level magic crystal.

It was more likely to get magic crystals from demonic monsters at higher levels, so they were able to collect more magic crystals as they gradually met higher level demonic monsters.

Mo Qilin now not only had a first-level magic crystal, but he also had a second-level magic crystal and a third-level magic crystal. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t give them to him, Mo Qilin went to give the demonic monsters the last deadly hit when Gu Ning had almost killed them, then he dug the magic crystals out by himself.

Mo Qilin originally thought that Gu Ning needed his help because she was occupied with fighting against other demonic monsters back then. After Mo Qilin dug the magic crystals out, he handed them to Gu Ning. However, Gu Ning wanted him to take them as his own, so she wouldn’t take them.

She just felt it would be like charity to Mo Qilin if she dug it out and gave it to him. It would make Mo Qilin upset, so she decided to let him do it on his own.

Mo Qilin actually wouldn’t be upset, because it was an honor to him that Gu Ning was willing to give the magic crystal to him. However, Mo Qilin understood that Gu Ning meant to let him get the magic crystal on his own by killing the demonic monster at the last second. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Because of that, Mo Qilin felt very grateful. However, Mo Qilin had a question when Gu Ning told him to kill the demonic monster with a magic crystal, so he asked curiously, “Senior Qing He, how did you know there is a magic crystal in this demonic monster?”

If she could know that beforehand, it would be unbelievable.

“I’m not sure. I just felt there was,” said Gu Ning.

Hearing that, Mo Qilin stopped asking about it.

“With these three magic crystals, I’ll surely get into the top 10. Three years ago, only the few at the top had two magic crystals, and they were all at first or second level. Now I have three magic crystals. One of them is even at the third level. I could rank sixth even three years ago,” said Mo Qilin with satisfaction. Although he didn’t get all the magic crystals on his own, he was still filled with happiness.

Mo Qilin continued, “Oh, Baili Zongyang won the first prize three years ago. He only had seven magic crystals back then. Two at the fourth level, one at the third level, three at the second level, and one at the first level.”

If what Mo Qilin said was true, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting now had more magic crystals than Baili Zongyang had three years ago. It seemed that they could certainly win the first and second prize, but Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t think so.

There were only two cultivators at the Golden Core Stage last year, but this year had six, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting thought that tgey should still be careful. They needed to get more magic crystals in the last three hours.

It wasn’t easy to deal with fifth-level demonic monsters, but luckily Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were able to handle them. It only took them longer.

Mo Qilin could hardly hurt fifth-level demonic monsters, so he stopped fighting, and instead focused on protecting himself.

In half an hour, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting finally killed five fifth-level demonic monsters and got two fifth-level magic crystals.

Unfortunately, before they fully recovered, they met other three fifth-level demonic monsters. However, luckily there were only three, so they still had strength to continue to fight.

Because they had just consumed some strength, it took them almost half an hour to kill the fifth-level demonic monsters.

Luckily, one of them had a magic crystal.

Mo Qilin had been surprised by Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s good luck and abilities too many times, so he had no special feelings this time, but he was still happy for them when they got magic crystals again.

The battle was over. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were slightly tired, but they didn’t rest right away. Instead, they directly took out power crystals to refill themselves with strength so that they could continue to move.

At the beginning, Mo Qilin thought the power crystals were common antidote pills, so he was totally amazed when Gu Ning told him that they could stop the effects of all poisons and could quickly help them recover.

After that, Mo Qilin asked her what kind of magical pills they were.
