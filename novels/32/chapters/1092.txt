Chapter 1095 The Female Cultivator Next Door

What surprised Gu Ning the most was that the magical power of the jade was being absorbed into Dongfang Ziyu’s body.Gu Ning rounded her eyes in shock, but also realized that cultivators really needed magical power to practice their inner discipline.

Although Dongfang Ziyu was in the middle of her practice, she sensed that someone was staring at her. However, she couldn’t figure out why, because this room was completely closed. She had searched the room and found no surveillance camera.

Maybe it was a wrong impression.

She was in the middle of her practice now, so she couldn’t stop, or her soul would be damaged. Therefore, she had to continue even if she felt like someone was staring at her.

Gu Ning also understood that cultivators all had acute senses, so she soon withdrew her look.

“Ningning, what’s wrong?” Leng Shaoting asked Gu Ning with concern.

“Be quiet.” Gu Ning made a hand gesture to tell Leng Shaoting to keep his voice low, then pulled him into the bedroom.

Dongfang Ziyu was sitting next to the living room, so Gu Ning was worried that Dongfang Ziyu might hear their discussion. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Zi Beiying was staying in the adjacent room next to their bedroom, but Zi Beiying was an ordinary person, so she couldn’t hear their talk.

Gu Ning didn’t open her mouth again until they were in the bedroom. “The female cultivator is in the next room.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was surprised.

“Cultivators have acute senses, so we can’t make too many noises tonight,” Gu Ning said all of a sudden.

Leng Shaoting understood Gu Ning’s meaning and felt a little upset because they couldn’t have sex tonight.

Gu Ning simply thought it would be super embarrassing if Dongfang Ziyu heard the sound of them making love.

Leng Shaoting respected Gu Ning, so he agreed. He only kissed and cuddled her before they went to sleep.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting also didn’t talk much in case Dongfang Ziyu heard anything important.

...

Dongfang Ziyu stopped practicing at 11 pm. After absorbing the magical power from the good jade, her mysterious power was improved a little, but she still needed to absorb more and more magical power.

It would take a long time for her to get to the next level of her inner discipline.

Dongfang Ziyu took a bath before she went to bed.

...

The next day, everyone got up around 7 am.

Gu Ning and the others didn’t see Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua when they left their rooms, but they met them in the dining hall.

Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua were slightly surprised to see Gu Ning and her friends, but they didn’t pay much attention to them.

Gu Ning and others left after having breakfast.

“Ziyu, could they have been the ones robbed by those robbers?” Wu Shunhua asked when Gu Ning and her friends left. They could see that Gu Ning and her friends were all good at fighting.

Dongfang Ziyu thought that it was possible.

“If that’s the case, they must be very excellent at martial arts,” Dongfang Ziyu said.

It wasn’t easy to beat up eight armed robbers. Although Gu Ning also used guns, it was still very difficult.

“It’s not important. Let’s enjoy our breakfast now,” Dongfang Ziyu added.

...

Gu Ning and the others planned to check out at 9 am.

“Will you go with us or not?” Gu Ning asked Zi Beiying.

“I’ll go with you. I don’t know what to do here,” Zi Beiying said.

“Great, we’ll check out at 9 am,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure,” Zi Beiying said.

At 9 am, they checked out together and went to Colorful Jade Provider.

“Wow, there are so many pieces of jade!” Zi Beiying exclaimed the second she walked into the factory.

Even though she knew little about jade, she was aware that it was hard to cut out jade, especially jade of high quality.

Nevertheless, Gu Ning had Jade Eyes, so it was very easy for her to find good jade.

“Gu Ning, I thought that you’re only the owner of Jade Beauty Jewelry, but it turns out that you own one of the three largest jade providers in City Teng as well!” Zi Beiying admired Gu Ning more than ever now.

“There is more you don’t know,” Gu Ning said with a mysterious smile.

“Which other companies do you have?” Zi Beiying asked curiously.

“It’s not fun if I tell you directly. You can find out for yourself,” Gu Ning said.

“You’re right.” Zi Beiying nodded.

...

At the same time, Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua went to the street of jade raw materials. They didn’t play stone-gambling, but just came here to bid for jade.

After walking for a while, Dongfang Ziyu found the office of Colorful Jade Provider by the road. They didn’t know that it was Gu Ning’s company, but thought that there could be a lot of jade.

Without hesitation, Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua walked inside.
