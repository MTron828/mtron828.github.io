“I can’t, but I can read faces. So I can see that your forehead is dark and you might be injured soon, but I don’t know when it’ll happen and how serious it is. Mr. Wang, if you trust me, I can draw a Taoist talisman for you. You can carry it wherever you go, it can protect you from being hurt,” Leng Xiaoyao said seriously. She understood that Wang Yiming didn’t trust her very much. After all, there were few people who believed it, especially when they heard it from a young girl’s mouth.

Thank you readers!

“You can draw Taoist talismans?” Wang Yiming was surprised again.

“Yes, I know normally people don’t believe it, but it doesn’t mean that it’s not true. Mr. Wang, if you still think it’s unbelievable, it won’t do you any harm if you carry a Taoist talisman with you,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

She didn’t expect Wang Yiming to trust her right now. As long as he could accept her talisman and carry it with him, he would believe it once the accident happened.

Wang Yiming agreed. Whether it was true or not, he also wanted to be safe. Therefore, he accepted it. “Sure, thank you, Leng Xiaoyao.”

Since Wang Yiming accepted it, Leng Xiaoyao immediately took out paper, a pen, and cinnabar from her backpack. Wang Yiming was surprised. He didn’t expect Leng Xiaoyao to carry it with her.

Even though he was confused, he chose to stay silent.

After Leng Xiaoyao placed it properly, she quickly drew a talisman.

Seeing Leng Xiaoyao drawing it so proficiently, Wang Yiming was shocked. He was convinced and believed in Leng Xiaoyao’s words and abilities.

Leng Xiaoyao folded the talisman and handed it to Wang Yiming. “Keep it with you. Don’t touch it with water. After this talisman helps you survive once, it’ll turn into ashes and disappear.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Great, thank you, Leng Xiaoyao.” Wang Yiming immediately took it. Even though he still had doubts, he was willing to listen to her.

“My pleasure. I’ll go back to the classroom now,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Sure.” Wang Yiming answered. Then Leng Xiaoyao packed up her stuff at once and walked out.

Wang Yiming had mixed emotions. If it was real, Leng Xiaoyao had many skills that were beyond his imagination!

Without delay, Wang Yiming put away the Taoist magic figure and went to see the principal. He needed to tell the principal that Leng Xiaoyao agreed to take part in the Liberal Arts Defense.

As soon as Leng Xiaoyao walked into the classroom, she attracted a lot of attention from her classmates. They were all surprised and stunned by her beauty, but didn’t know who she was.

“Boss, you…” Xiong Manxin exclaimed. Because she hadn’t seen Leng Xiaoyao without freckles before, she was surprised by Leng Xiaoyao’s appearance today.

Boss?

Leng Xiaoyao?

This beautiful girl was Leng Xiaoyao?

How was that possible?

In that instant, everyone was extremely surprised.

“Are you Leng Xiaoyao?” someone asked.

“Did you put on make-up?” asked another person.

“I didn’t. The freckles on my face have been removed,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“I didn’t expect you to be so pretty without the freckles!”

“I think you’re even prettier than Gao Qilu!”

No one doubted it when Leng Xiaoyao said that her freckles were removed.

“Right, I think Leng Xiaoyao is the prettiest girl in our school now,”

Gao Qilu was the current well-known, prettiest girl in their school and she studied in the best class.

“I agree with you, but if Gao Qilu hears about it, I’m afraid she’ll make things difficult for Leng Xiaoyao.”

Thinking of that, they were worried about Leng Xiaoyao.

Gao Qilu was different from An Chenmeng and Leng Xiaoyao. She tended to play dirty tricks. On the surface, she looked friendly and wanted to make friends with you. She always smiled at you, but you had no idea when she would scheme against you.

Besides, Gao Qilu’s family was one of the richest families in City Chang. Her family was even richer than An Chenmeng’s, so people were very scared of her.

Those who knew what kind of person Gao Qilu was would rather offend An Chenmeng than her.

If they offended An Chenmeng, they would only be beaten once and An Chenmeng would let them go.

However, if they offended Gao Qilu, they wouldn’t be able to bear the result because Gao Qilu was skilled at defaming a person and ruining their reputation.

It had happened many times before. Unfortunately, those victims were from much poorer families, so they didn’t dare to sue Gao Qilu.

“If so, we better not say it aloud. Anyway, I think Leng Xiaoyao is the prettiest girl in our school.”

All the students in Class 8 were Leng Xiaoyao’s fans now. Therefore, they didn’t want Gao Qilu to cause trouble for her.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t take Gao Qilu seriously, but she didn’t want to get in trouble either.

“Boss, I thought you put on make-up! I can’t believe that your freckles have been removed.” As soon as Leng Xiaoyao was back in her seat, Xiong Manxin complimented her.

“Right! How did you remove your freckles?” Wu Minmin asked curiously.

Leng Xiaoyao told them the same explanation she gave Leng Changyuan and the other family members. They believed it.

Once the morning classes were over, An Chenmeng ran to see Leng Xiaoyao and they went to have a meal together.

Even if Leng Xiaoyao was absent, she would go to see Xiong Manxin and the other girls. She totally forgot her own friends.

Lin Xiaoxiao was fine with that and didn’t have any disagreements, but the other girls hated Leng Xiaoyao more than ever.

Leng Xiaoyao understood that very well, so she asked An Chenmeng, “Aren’t you afraid that your friends will be mad if you run to see us every time?”

“Why would they be mad? Don’t I have the right to hang out with other people? I asked them to come with me, but they refused. I can’t do anything about that. Anyway, I’ll still come to see you even if they don’t come with me. Everyone has the freedom to make friends. I won’t say anything if they go to meet other girls,” An Chenmeng said. She didn’t think it was a big deal, even though her friends were a bit unhappy about that.

“You’re right, but you should care about their feelings since you are friends. If we leave you behind and go hang out with other girls, how would you feel?”

Upon thinking of that, An Chenmeng was displeased and she answered honestly. “I’ll be unhappy!”

“So, although everyone has the freedom to make friends, you are their friend. You can’t just go to see them when you need them and abandon them when they’re unnecessary. It hurts. After all, you’ve been friends for so long. You can’t leave them behind as you want. Otherwise no one will be willing to be friends with you,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Because of that, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t cut off her friendship with Xiong Manxin and the other girls even though she wasn’t the same Leng Xiaoyao right now.
