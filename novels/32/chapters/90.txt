Chapter 91: Be Unkind?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

She wasn’t afraid that he’d searched for the gun, but she also didn’t want to cause a scene.

When Gu Ning got back to her school, it was five minutes away from the start of class. Thus Gu Ning immediately ran to her classroom from the gate.

However, when she was about to enter the teaching building, someone stood in her way. If she hadn’t stopped on time, she would have knocked him over.

Seeing that the person was Qin Zheng, Gu Ning was upset. She avoided him, wanting to leave.

“Gu Ning, can we talk?” Qin Zheng asked her at once.

Gu Ning hadn’t replied to his message on Friday. He had been annoyed, but he couldn’t help but worry about her, so he had sent another message to Gu Ning on Saturday.

The result had been the same.

Qin Zheng had then directly called Gu Ning. Surprisingly he found out that Gu Ning had already blocked him. He was so mad at Gu Ning that he had decided to not care about her any more.

When he hadn’t seen Gu Ning on Monday, he had wanted to ask Mu Ke about it, but felt embarrassed to do so.

He had heard about what had happened from Gu Xiaoxiao this morning. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“I have nothing to talk to you about,” Gu Ning said plainly. She wanted to avoid Qin Zheng, but was stopped by him again.

Gu Ning’s cold attitude aggravated Qin Zheng. He said with slight anger, “Gu Ning, how could you be so unkind? I just wanted to help after I heard that you had been kicked out of your old house.”

“I am unkind? Help me?” Hearing that, Gu Ning laughed in a sarcastic way. She looked at him with dislike. “Qin Zheng, is there anyone who’ve told you that you’re very arrogant?”

“You...” Qin Zheng was annoyed at being humiliated by Gu Ning.

He did want to help her, but she said that he was merely being arrogant.

Apparently, Qin Zheng still didn’t understand Gu Ning’s words.

“Besides, how come I am the unkind person? Just because I don’t want to talk to you? I don’t need you help at all. You want to help someone who doesn’t need your help. Doesn’t it sound ridiculous?” Gu Ning didn’t hesitate to humiliate him again.

“Gu Ning, you...” Qin Zheng’s face turned red, and his eyes were ablaze with anger.

“Stay away from me, or you’ll pay for it,” Gu Ning threatened him. Then she left directly.

Qin Zheng intended to keep arguing with Gu Ning, but hearing Gu Ning’s warning, he somehow couldn’t say a word. He did feel threatened.

At the same time, he also felt greatly humiliated. He wanted to teach Gu Ning a lesson right now to vent his anger. At the same time, he wasn’t willing to see anything bad happen to her. The boy now had mixed emotions.

On the stairs, Gu Xiaoxiao was glaring at Gu Ning.

Obviously, she had seen and heard Gu Ning talking with Qin Zheng just then.

Gu Ning ignored her, but when she walked past, she gave Gu Xiaoxiao a provocative look.

Gu Xiaoxiao wanted to tear her into pieces right away, but she didn’t dare to do it.

Why? Why did Qin Zheng want to help Gu Ning? He was Gu Xiaoxiao’s boyfriend now!

Did Qin Zheng really fall in love with Gu Ning because of her changes recently?

No, impossible!

Even though Gu Ning had changed, she was still a poor girl, who could never match with Qin Zheng.

Qin Zheng turned around. He saw Gu Xiaoxiao who was in a rage right in front of him. He immediately knew something was wrong. “Xiaoxiao, please don’t be mad at me. I just felt guilty about what had happened before, so I want to help her. Nothing else,” Qin Zheng explained.

“But she is fine now!” Gu Xiaoxiao retorted. She wasn’t criticizing Qin Zheng actually. She was simply dissatisfied to see Qin Zheng wanting to help Gu Ning.

“I know she’s fine now, but we were the cause after all. Do you know, I’m not a cold-blooded person. I’ve already done evil things because of you. Can you still not believe my loyalty to you?” Qin Zheng lied skilfully. He was an adept liar.

Gu Xiaoxiao felt better after Qin Zheng’s explanation, but she still warned him, “Don’t ever talk to her or help her again. She deserved to be kicked out of the old house.”

In Gu Xiaoxiao’s eyes, Gu Ning was wrong in everything.

“Fine, fine. Class is almost starting. Let’s go back!” Qin Zheng answered airily. He himself didn’t even notice that his attitude towards Gu Xiaoxiao had changed gradually.

Gu Xiaoxiao closed her mouth, but she now hated Gu Ning more than ever.

...

After the evening class, Gu Ning failed to notice that Leng Shaoting was following her again.

Even though there were many students in school uniforms in the evening, Leng Shaoting still recognized Gu Ning from the first glance.

However, when he found out that Gu Ning didn’t take a bus or a taxi, but ran home, he was surprised.

He knew Gu Ning was good at fighting, but it was dangerous for a teenage girl to run home at night.

Leng Shaoting had intended to take the gun back from Gu Ning, but now he somehow felt worried about the girl. He suddenly forgot his real goal, but wanted to protect her secretly.

Leng Shaoting didn’t realize it until they were close to Fenghua Luxury Mansion.

She lived in Fenghua Luxury Mansion?

Leng Shaoting wanted to approach Gu Ning for the gun, but she greeted a middle-aged man, then walked inside with him.

Leng Shaoting believed that the man was Gu Ning’s father, but no matter who he was, Leng Shaoting wouldn’t show up as long as there was someone else with Gu Ning.

Therefore, he could only continue to follow her to find out what her address was.

The middle-aged man was Jiang Xu. Gu Qing wanted to eat fruit, so he went out to buy some. On his way back, he met Gu Ning by accident.

On their way, Jiang Xu told Gu Ning about the rent for the store. The rent was settled at the price of five hundred thousand yuan. He had signed a lease of five years, and would pay the rent yearly.

The store was still in a mess, and the owner needed to clean it up first, so the lease would come into effect from the next Monday.

Today was Tuesday, so it was five days away.

Meanwhile, Jiang Xu still needed to deal with many things. He had to register, contact manufacturers, hire staff and so forth.
