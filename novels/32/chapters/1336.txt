Chapter 1338: Xia Yichu Is Injured

Her life had a complete change afterwards, and she became a totally different person. It seemed like a person that had two lives. However, it was impossible for a person to have two lives, so the old man couldn’t figure it out.

The old man was disappointed that he failed to tell Gu Ning’s fortune, but he wasn’t in despair, because he had a feeling that they would meet again. He believed in fate.

...

Gu Ning was relieved after walking far away.

Leng Shaoting understood that Gu Ning was worried and wanted to avoid the old man.

He didn’t want to interfere in her own things, but he was afraid that it might hurt Gu Ning, so he asked, “Ningning, why are you avoiding him?”

Hearing that, Gu Ning panicked a little. She absolutely couldn’t tell Leng Shaoting that she had been reborn before. “Well, I’m just afraid that he might see my Jade Eyes.”

Leng Shaoting nodded, because it was indeed an important secret. “Right, you must be careful from now on.”

If anyone else knew about it, Gu Ning would be in danger.

Even though Gu Ning wasn’t weak at all, he still felt anxious when there was someone who wanted to hurt her.

“I will,” Gu Ning said. She disliked trouble and would do everything to avoid it.

...

Once Battle in the Sky was released, it was becoming increasingly popular.

More and more people were attracted to it after only one afternoon.

Those who wanted to add Gu Ning as their friend but failed because their levels were too low crazily spent a lot more time and energy playing the game. They ached to be Gu Ning’s friends to play a round against or with her.

As for other people, they were simply addicted to the game.

...

Gu Ning went back home at 9:30 pm.

Leng Shaoting stayed in Gu Ning’s house that night.

Although Leng Shaoting didn’t have to fulfill a mission these days, it didn’t mean that he could stay outside and be free all day long. He still needed to go back to the military base tomorrow.

Actually, he was supposed to leave today, but Gu Ning was going back to the capital, so he delayed the departure time until tomorrow. He had nothing important to deal with, so it wasn’t a big deal.

Leng Shaoting hadn’t stayed alone with Gu Ning for a long time, and he missed her so much in bed. So because he had to leave tomorrow, he had sex again and again with Gu Ning that night.

“Ningning, I don’t want to leave you.” Leng Shaoting hugged Gu Ning in his arms. He wished that they were an ordinary couple who could stay with each other every day. However, he couldn’t because of his job.

“I don’t want to leave you either.” Gu Ning hugged him tight. She was reluctant to leave Leng Shaoting, but she was more mature than him, so she didn’t feel too sad.

Leng Shaoting was deeper in love than she was in their relationship. However, it didn’t mean that she loved Leng Shaoting less than Leng Shaoting loved her. What Leng Shaoting could do for her was what she was also willing to do for him.

The next day, Leng Shaoting left after lunch.

Gu Ning also went to her company for work later.

As soon as Gu Ning walked into the hall, she saw Lu Xiao walking outside with an angry expression.

Lu Xiao was struck dumb for a second when he saw Gu Ning. “Oh, hi, boss.”

“What’s wrong? Why do you look so mad?” Gu Ning asked.

“Xia Yichu wass injured during the shooting of her music video,” Lu Xiao said with his eyes full of worry.

Gu Ning was aware of Lu Xiao’s affection towards Xia Yichu, so she knew that he must be very concerned.

“How is she now? Is it serious?” Gu Ning asked with concern as Xia Yichu’s boss.

“She broke her leg and she’s in the hospital now. I’m on my way to visit her,” Lu Xiao replied.

“I’ll go with you,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure.” Lu Xiao agreed.

After that, they went to the hospital together.

At the same time, Tang Haifeng had the reply to the engagement date for Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning from Zhao Yiru, but it wasn’t delightful.

“Tang, although I’m not an expert on xuanxue, I think I still need to be honest with you. I don’t think Shaoting should have the engagement this year from his date of birth and eight characters of a horoscope. It’s better to delay it,” Zhao Yiru said.

“Well, I trust you. Since you think it’s better to delay it, we can delay it. It isn’t a big deal.” Tang Haifeng thought that it wouldn’t make a difference whether Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were engaged this year or next year.

Tang Haifeng then told Leng Weihua about it. Although Leng Weihua also felt a little disappointed, he accepted it. He believed in superstitions to some extent.

However, what they didn’t know was that Zhao Yiru actually found that Leng Shaoting was going to go through a tribulation, but he didn’t know how serious it would be. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He only knew a little about xuanxue, so he wasn’t very sure of the result.
