807 Gong Zhengyang“s Death

Wang Yunping thought that it made sense to her. Lu Qiuting had schemed against her anyway, so it wasn’t a surprise if she had drugged Feng Pinghui in order to marry him.

“Yunping, let me take care of you and our kid from now on. Please allow me to take responsibility as a father,” Feng Pinghui begged. He didn’t mention their relationship for now, because he knew that she cared about the kid most. Whether or not they could get back together again, he made up his mind to take good care of them.

“Why do you have to do that? Although we live a poor life, we feel quite happy, and we have no intention to be involved in your rich family,” Wang Yunping said. She knew clearly that it would become complicated once she and her son accepted Feng Pinghui.

“Zesheng is also my son. Since he’s my son, it’s my duty to raise him, and he has the right to inherit my properties as well. You can’t deny that,” Feng Pinghui said, and it meant that he was willing to let Wang Zesheng inherit some of his properties.

Even though Wang Zesheng was his love child, he was still a member of the Feng family. To be specific, he was the eldest son, so he absolutely had the right to inherit its wealth. Feng Pinghui had two sons, and he would let the more outstanding one be the leader of their family.

Anyway, Wang Zesheng could inherit some of his properties whether or not he was the heir of the Feng family in the future.

Speaking of the heir of the Feng family, Feng Pinghui preferred to train Wang Zesheng, because Wang Zesheng was the child he had with his beloved woman. He knew that it was unfair, but he was willing to do so.

Wang Yunping, however, was shocked.

“Yunping, please.” Feng Pinghui begged her again.

“I...” Wang Yunping hesitated.

“Yunping, please give me a chance to make it up to you. Don’t worry, I promise that I won’t interfere in your life without your permission. I just want to provide better conditions for you,” Feng Pinghui said.

“I’m afraid that I can’t give you an answer right now, because I need to ask for Zesheng’s opinion.” Wang Yunping actually agreed in her heart, because she also hoped that her son could get a better education, but she would let her son make the final decision.

Although Feng Pinghui was eager to take care of them, he knew that he should take it slow, in case they disliked him, so he didn’t say anything further.

...

When it was almost 12 pm, an accident happened on the road to the airport. A black Rolls-Royce suddenly exploded. Its driver was fine but the man who sat in the rear seat was badly injured, and his life was in danger.

People soon found out that the seriously-injured man was the son-in-law of the Yao family, Gong Zhengyang.

Hearing that, Yao Guanghui was relieved, but he had to pretend to be sad.

Yao Lihui was stunned when she heard the terrible news, and almost passed out. She did her best to stay calm, and went to the hospital to visit Gong Zhengyang at once.

Gong Zhengyang was in the middle of an operation when she arrived.

Outside of the operating room, Mrs. Yao hugged Yao Lihui who was trembling in fear in her arms. “He’ll be fine. Don’t worry, he’ll be fine.” Mrs. Yao kept comforting her.

If Mrs. Yao knew Gong Zhengyang’s real identity, she would wish him to be killed more than anyone else.

After an hour, the operation ended and the doctor walked out with a serious face and sad news. Gong Zhengyang was too injured to be saved.

Hearing that, Yao Lihui burst into tears, then fainted. Mrs. Yao was also heart-broken, while Yao Guanghui remained silent.

Yao Lihui’s older brother, on the other hand, had mixed emotions. He felt a little sad, but more because he felt sorry that a young life was gone. In fact, he never liked Gong Zhengyang, because he thought that Gong Zhengyang was very hypocritical.

When Gu Ning heard the news, she sent Qiao Ya to get more details. Qiao Ya went to the hospital and reported Gong Zhengyang’s death to Gu Ning after the doctor announced it.

Leng Shaoting was coming to City B today, and would arrive around 4 pm, so Gu Ning wasn’t sure whether she would be free tonight. Therefore, Gu Ning left for the abandoned buildings once she received Qiao Ya’s report to tell Tao Dinglin, the female ghost, the latest news.

An Guangyao would send a group of workers there tomorrow. It would be inappropriate if the female ghost was still there.

Seeing Gu Ning coming, Tao Dinglin’s face lit up, but her unusually pale face looked quite scary.

“Is it done?” Tao Dinglin asked.

“Yeah, he’s dead,” Gu Ning said, and showed Tao Dinglin the video that Qiao Ya shot for her.

Tao Dinglin didn’t see Gong Zhengyang in the video, but she recognized the Yao family, and heard the doctor’s announcement about Gong Zhengyang’s death.

“Ha-ha, ha-ha!” Tao Dinglin guffawed, which sounded frightening. She was a ghost, not a human being after all.

Gu Ning felt uncomfortable, but didn’t stop her.

“Gong Zhengyang, I’ve waited for today for five years! Five years! It was so painful, and you’re finally dead now, ha-ha, ha-ha.”

“I treated you so well before, but what did you do to me? You kept lying to me and you never cherished me.”

“You even hired a bunch of hoodlums to rape me to death...”

Tao Dinglin shouted, guffawed and cried.

When Tao Dinglin had enough, her hatred gradually went away as well. Since her enemy was dead, there was no need for her to stick to her grudge. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Tao Dinglin’s ghost started to become transparent before Gu Ning’s eyes.

“Thank you.” Tao Dinglin smiled at Gu Ning with sincerity.

After that, Tao Dinglin disappeared, and Gu Ning also left.
