2917 Take Revenge in Person?

She got many Taoist talismans from Shangguan Yang. Among them, a kind of talisman could make ghosts show their real appearances. In that case, the ghost could take revenge by herself, but the man must deserve the punishment.

If the man was innocent, Gu Ning wouldn’t allow the ghost to kill him.

When Jiang Yutong turned around, she saw Gu Ning behind her and was scared. She didn’t expect to see anyone at this time and she hadn’t felt it at all.

“Who are you? What are you doing here?” Jiang Yutong asked coldly. To be specific, it was the ghost that was talking with Gu Ning.

After Jiang Yutong was possessed by the ghost, her consciousness fell into deep sleep, so the ghost controlled her mind now.

“As a ghost, you possessed a human’s body. It’s not allowed in this world. You should be punished for doing that,” Gu Ning said coldly.

“W-Who are you?” The ghost was frightened and stepped back subconsciously. How could this girl tell that she was a ghost?

In addition, Gu Ning didn’t look scared at all. Obviously, Gu Ning was stronger than it, so the ghost became alert.

“That’s not important. What’s important is what you want to do.” Gu Ning said.

“I was left with no choice but to possess a mortal’s body. I need to take revenge. After doing that, I’ll leave,” the ghost said, trying to persuade Gu Ning to let it go.

“Do you think she can still live after you leave her body? If not, you’ll kill her,” Gu Ning said.

The ghost said nothing, because it didn’t think much when it possessed Jiang Yutong’s body. It only wanted to take revenge.

It still had the same idea right now, but it didn’t dare to say that aloud because it was afraid of Gu Ning.

Gu Ning saw through it. After all, it was a ghost, so it couldn’t care less about a mortal’s life.

“What exactly do you want to do?” the ghost asked.

“I came to kill you, but after hearing what you said I think perhaps I can do you a favor,” Gu Ning said.

“You want to help me?” The ghost couldn’t believe it.

“Yeah, I have sympathy for what you’ve suffered. Although I have the responsibility to kill monsters and ghosts, I won’t kill all of them for no reason whenever I see one. So, if what you said is the truth, I can help you take revenge, but not with this body. I hate Jiang Yutong, but she’s a relative of my cousin’s family. If she commits a crime, my cousin’s family will be in trouble,” Gu Ning explained.

“What I said is the truth, but if I don’t possess this body, how can I take revenge?” The ghost was a little mad. Because its own body was useless now, it had to possess a mortal’s body.

“I need to make sure of that first. You can still take revenge even if you don’t possess a mortal’s body, but you’ll completely disappear afterwards. Actually, it’s doomed, whether you listen to me or not, but I can be honest with you. If you dare to resist, you won’t even have the chance to take revenge,” Gu Ning said. She didn’t want the ghost to take revenge with Jiang Yutong’s body.

“I can still take revenge without possessing this body? How?” the ghost asked. It didn’t care about the consequences, because getting revenge was what it wanted to do the most. As long as it could take revenge, there was nothing it cared about in this world.

In fact, if it could take revenge in person, it wouldn’t want to use another person’s body. After all, it would feel better.

“I can help you,” Gu Ning replied.

“Why should I trust you?” the ghost asked.

“Because you don’t have a choice, or you can give it a try,” Gu Ning said. She couldn’t care less.

“Great, let me try it first!” The ghost definitely wanted to try it. If Gu Ning was really stronger than it, it would listen to her because it was left with no choice.

If Gu Ning wasn’t better than it, it would continue to carry out its plan.

The next moment, the ghost summoned miasma into its hands and attacked Gu Ning.

At the same time, Gu Ning summoned magical energy to fight against the miasma. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The two kinds of energy hit each other halfway, and the miasma was scattered in different directions. The magical energy continued till it hit the ghost’s palm.

The ghost was hit heavily and fell a few meters away.

It was almost knocked out of Jiang Yutong’s body.

This time, the ghost realized that it was no match for Gu Ning, even though they had only fought against each other for a short while.

“What do you think now?” Gu Ning asked, walking toward the ghost.

“Will you really help me?” the ghost asked. It couldn’t fully trust Gu Ning, but it knew that it was left with no choice.

“Sure, otherwise I wouldn’t have spent so much time talking to you. I could have directly knocked you out of Jiang Yutong’s body. As long as she’s alive, I can save her life. You’re not a problem in my eyes,” Gu Ning said.

The ghost wouldn’t have believed Gu Ning’s words earlier, but now it was completely convinced.

Without outstanding abilities, Gu Ning wouldn’t be so confident.

“Fine, I can trust you for now. What will you do next?” the ghost asked.

“Tell me your story,” Gu Ning requested.

“Sure.” The ghost answered. “It was my stepfather who killed me and my mother. When I was five, my father passed away in an accident. He left us a company and my mother did her best to keep it profitable. My stepfather helped us. Because he was my father’s friend and worked in his company, my mother gradually fell in love with him. That year, I was thirteen. After my mother married my stepfather, he still treated us very well, but a few years afterwards, my mother was in a bad condition, so she left the company to my stepfather to manage. Unfortunately, my stepfather stole the company and even burned my mother and me to death at home. This house used to be our home.”

Saying that, the ghost seemed furious. It couldn’t wait to kill that ungrateful man.

Gu Ning also felt mad.

Although there were many bad people in this world, she wouldn’t think much about it before meeting them. However, once she met such bad people, her mood would be affected.
