Chapter 699 No Intention of Alliance

Mrs. Lin said, “I think you can try. Maybe she’ll forgive you.”

“Alright, I’ll handle it myself. Stop telling me how to deal with it!” Lin Tianyou lost his patience, and left his home.

“You...” Mrs. Lin was displeased, but Lin Tianyou was already gone.

Mrs. Lin thought for a while, then called Zhao Xiaoxuan, but Zhao Xiaoxuan’s phone was turned off, so she called Mrs. Zhao.

Although Mrs. Zhao listened to Zhao Xiaoxuan and didn’t contact Lin Tianyou or his mother, she wouldn’t refuse to answer Mrs. Lin’s call, because she wanted to seize this chance to vent her anger.

“Oh, Mrs. Lin, may I help?” Mrs. Zhao said in a sarcastic tone.

Mrs. Lin, of course, understood that Mrs. Zhao was mad at Lin Tianyou, and it was Lin Tianyou’s fault after all. “Well, Mrs. Zhao, I’m so sorry for what has happened to Xiaoxuan, but Tianyou is very regretful now. He doesn’t know how to face Xiaoxuan, so I called Xiaoxuan on his behalf, but Xiaoxuan’s phone is turned off.”

“He’s regretful now? Really?” Mrs. Zhao laughed like she had just heard a funny joke. “Mrs. Lin, I’m not an idiot. Lin Tianyou must have been rejected by Yu Zi, so he came back to Xiaoxuan. Lin Tianyou doesn’t like Xiaoxuan at all, and all he wants is our family’s properties! Xiaoxuan knows it very well, and she’s made up her mind to move on.” After that, Mrs. Zhao hung up on Mrs. Lin.

Mrs. Lin felt so hopeless now, because Lin Tianyou suffered a double loss this time.

All the other families of equal social status as their family that they knew had a son at least, and those families wouldn’t leave all the properties to a daughter. A daughter would have a good dowry at the most, which wasn’t what Mrs. Lin wanted. Mrs. Lin hoped that Lin Tianyou could marry a girl who was born in a richer or more powerful family than them, but it was impossible.

At this moment, Mrs. Lin regretted that she had supported Lin Tianyou to get Yu Zi back. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting left the Tang family’s house together because someone had just called her. The man claimed to be the general manager of Xianglong Jewelry; he wanted to talk about business with her.

Gu Ning, who had a great memory, remembered that they had exchanged name cards at the release conference.

There was no need for Gu Ning to guess because she knew his purpose very well. However, since he didn’t say it aloud yet, Gu Ning wouldn’t reject right now. Therefore, she went to meet the man along with Leng Shaoting

When Gu Ning left, she called Qiao Ya and told her to fly back to City F with Gu Man. Afterwards, Gu Ning booked plane tickets for Qiao Ya and Gu Man.

Gu Man and Tang Yunfan seemed to make no progress in their relationship, but they had a tacit understanding. Their way of getting along with each other was a bit like the feeling of a couple who had been married for many years. There was no passion between them, but there was an unusual harmony. They weren’t a young couple after all, so they wouldn’t hug or kiss one another like Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting

In a restaurant.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting walked into the appointed private room, and there were two men sitting inside. One was the general manager of Xianglong Jewelry, Du Haizhe, while the other was his secretary.

Du Haizhe was a man who was around 34 years old. He was wearing a suit like a professional businessman.

Seeing Gu Ning walking in, Du Haizhe and his secretary stood up to welcome them. “Please have a seat, Miss Gu and this gentleman,” Du Haizhe said politely. He didn’t know Leng Shaoting’s identity, so he had no idea how to address him.

“Nice to meet you, Manger Du,” Gu Ning said, then sat down with Leng Shaoting. Du Haizhe’s secretary poured two cups of tea for them at once.

Gu Ning didn’t say anything further, but enjoyed the tea.

“Miss Gu, the thing is our company hopes to join Jade Beauty Jewelry. If you’re willing to cooperate with our company, our company can provide you the best benefits,” Du Haizhe said with sincerity. Unfortunately, he was doomed to disappointment.

Hearing that, Gu Ning wasn’t surprised at all, because she guessed it beforehand. She smiled and said, “Thank you so much for your appreciation of Jade Beauty Jewelry, but I’m very sorry. My company has no intention of forming an alliance.”

Du Haizhe was struck dumb for a second, because he didn’t understand why Gu Ning rejected this good chance to make a lot of money.

“Miss Gu, don’t you want to make more money?” Du Haizhe asked.

“I do, but I have no intention to let others share my profits,” Gu Ning said plainly.

“Miss Gu, could you please consider it?” Du Haizhe frowned. He was unwilling to give up.

“I’m sorry,” Gu Ning said again.

“Fine, if so, I won’t insist. Although we can’t forge an alliance, I still hope to make friends with Miss Gu. If you don’t mind, can we share a meal together?” Du Haizhe asked.

He felt disappointed that Gu Ning refused to cooperate with them, but he wouldn’t annoy her either. They were peers, but there was no conflict between them. Jade Beauty Jewelry focused on jade, while Xianglong Jewelry provided jewelry made of gold, silver, jade, diamonds, and so on.

“I’m also glad to make friends with Manager Du, but unfortunately I’m very busy this afternoon, so I’m afraid that we can’t share a meal together today,” Gu Ning said. She was going to dine with Xu Jinchen and the others because they had to fly back to the capital tomorrow morning.
