Chapter 2367: Want to Quarrel?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Perhaps because he was so used to Si Jin’s old look, he felt that she looked unusually attractive now.

Si Jin also felt that Jiang Liluo was different when she saw him, but his hairstyle didn’t match his clothes.

“Um, Liluo, I think your hairstyle doesn’t match your look,” said Si Jin with slight embarrassment. She didn’t want to embarrass Jiang Liluo, but it was indeed strange.

Hearing that, Jiang Liluo was a little awkward, but he agreed with Si Jin. “Well, I actually had the same thought.”

“Because you’re wearing modern clothes, but your hairstyle is ancient, they don’t match at all. Are you willing to cut your hair? You can have the same hair style as Shaoting. Well, there are many other hairstyles. You can also go to a barbershop, but men normally have short hair nowadays,” said Gu Ning. She actually felt slightly embarrassed to point it out, but now that they noticed it by themselves, she could talk about it.

Jiang Liluo hesitated for a while. He was reluctant to cut his long hair. However, men in today’s society mostly had short hair. He was going to live in this new world now, so it was inappropriate for him to keep his long hair.

“Fine, let’s do it now!” Jiang Liluo agreed with alacrity.

Although men all had long hair in their world except for monks, they were in a different world now, so they had to learn to get used to it.

“Alright, we can go out for a meal together later. You can have a haircut then,” said Gu Ning.

“Ningning, I need to know more about the criminals,” said Leng Shaoting all of a sudden.

“Sure.”

Gu Ning agreed, then brought Leng Shaoting upstairs to her room.

Once they were in the room, Leng Shaoting closed the door and pressed Gu Ning against the wall.

“Aren’t you…” Didn’t Leng Shaoting want to learn more about the criminals?

Gu Ning wanted to ask him about that, but Leng Shaoting shut her mouth with his lips before she could say anything.

Gu Ning didn’t realize what he really wanted to do until now. Leng Shaoting wasn’t going to learn more about the criminals from her; he simply wanted to kiss her.

Gu Ning was amused.

Leng Shaoting’s kiss was very passionate at the beginning. He seemed to lose control of his desire. He wanted Gu Ning badly, but gradually he became gentle. However, he didn’t let Gu Ning go until both of them were out of breath.

In fact, he wanted more, but his reason stopped him because now wasn’t the right time.

After letting Gu Ning go, Leng Shaoting stared straight at her. Gu Ning panicked a little. She didn’t know what she had done wrong to make Leng Shaoting like this. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“W-What’s wrong?” Gu Ning didn’t think that she had done anything wrong, but she somehow felt guilty when she met Leng Shaoting’s dangerous eyes.

“If I didn’t come, would you have taught Jiang Liluo how to wear underwear?” Leng Shaoting asked, sounding dangerous.

Hearing that, Gu Ning blinked with a guilty conscience.

Why should she feel guilty? Although she had never thought about that, Leng Shaoting had told her that he would come! Therefore, Gu Ning argued. “No, before I came home, you told me that you were coming. Even if you didn’t come, it was a male employee who delivered the clothing. I could let him do that.”

“Oh, really? Then why did you panic just then?” Leng Shaoting squinted.

“I…” Gu Ning understood that Leng Shaoting wouldn’t believe it, so she didn’t know what to say now. She indeed panicked a little just then, but it didn’t mean anything!

Staring at her, Leng Shaoting said nothing nor did he let it go. He wanted to see how Gu Ning would explain it.

“I didn’t panic. You misunderstood me. Do you want to quarrel?” Gu Ning denied it and said angrily.

Leng Shaoting put on a resigned smile. There was deep love for her in his eyes. “Alright, I’m just joking.”

Although Leng Shaoting was indeed displeased with what happened earlier, he felt that he shouldn’t vent his anger on Gu Ning after hearing her explanation.

He had to admit that he easily got jealous. Even though he could keep his reason most of the time, he would still lose control a bit when he got jealous.

“Fine, I forgive you.” Gu Ning stopped arguing about it when Leng Shaoting softened.

“I have to leave now. I won’t finish until 2 pm. If you’re going to have a meal somewhere, tell me where you are eating. I can drive them there,” said Leng Shaoting.

“I can send you all to the airport together,” said Gu Ning.

“Great, but I’ll drive later.” Leng Shaoting agreed. He thought that Gu Ning wanted to stay with him for a while longer, and he wanted to spend more time with her too.

“Sure,” said Gu Ning, because she indeed wanted to stay with Leng Shaoting for a while longer.

After that, they went downstairs and Leng Shaoting left.

It was already 10 am when Leng Shaoting left, so Gu Ning was ready to take Jiang Liluo and Si Jin out.

Before they left, Gu Ning looked at Jiang Liluo’s long hair and felt it wasn’t appropriate. She said, “Senior Jiang, let me help you cut your hair a little. It’s too long. I don’t think you want to be the focus of everyone’s attention.”

It was unnecessary trouble.

“Thanks.” Since he already decided to cut his hair, Jiang Liluo didn’t think it was a big deal.

Therefore, Gu Ning cut Jiang Liluo’s hair till his shoulders, then tied it up.

Some men kept their hair to that length, mainly artists and stars, so it wasn’t strange. Other people might just take Jiang Liluo as an artist or a star.

Afterwards, Gu Ning found a suitcase and told them to put their clothes in. They would take it with them, because after eating, they would leave with Leng Shaoting.

Once they were out, Gu Ning took Jiang Liluo to a barbershop first.
