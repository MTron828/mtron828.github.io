Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Cai Wenhong also looked at Gu Ning with anticipation, he even forgot to introduce the two experts to her.

Gu Ning felt amused at being urged by them, but she understood their feelings. She left the bodyguards and chauffeurs brought here by Master Leng and the others in the lobby, then took them to the basement.

The bodyguards of Master Leng and the others all knew Gu Ning’s status, so they trusted her and weren’t worried about what she might do to hurt them.

The basement was dark, which was convenient for Gu Ning to do the next step. After opening the door, she didn’t turn on the light immediately, but used her consciousness to take the bronze chimes out of her telepathic eye space.

Once the lights were on, the others went inside.

Afterwards, they saw rows of bronze chimes standing against the wall, and were all stunned. Standing there in shock, none of them reacted.

.

They couldn’t believe their eyes! There were 9 groups of 3 layers of bronze chimes, and the number was about 60.

The whole set of bronze chimes included 65 pieces in 9 groups on 3 layers. It might be the whole set!

Cai Wenhong and the others who didn’t know that Gu Ning indeed owned a whole set of bronze chimes had that idea. Thinking of that, they took a long breath in.

Not only they were amazed; Master Leng and the others who were aware that Gu Ning had this whole set of bronze chimes were also shocked.

After a few seconds of great surprise, Master Leng was the first to get his senses back, and rushed ahead without delay.

“Wow, it’s so amazing!”

Jiang Zhongyu and Master Xu followed him.

Cai Wenhong and the other two appraisers immediately went ahead as well.

“M-Miss Gu, is this the whole set?” Cai Wenhong asked. He still couldn’t believe it, because it was too shocking to be true. Even his voice and body were trembling with excitement.

“Yeah, it’s the whole set. 65 pieces in 9 groups on 3 layers,” said Gu Ning in a calm tone, but Cai Wenhong couldn’t remain calm at all.

Although he already figured that out the second he saw the number, he still felt astonished by Gu Ning’s affirmative answer.

“A-Are you sure they’re all real?” Cai Wenhong asked again. It wasn’t his fault that he kept asking Gu Ning questions about that, because it was quite unbelievable. It wasn’t easy for him to accept it right away.

In addition, he was full of anticipation, so he was afraid that they might be fake, which would be a great disappointment.

“They’re all real. Curator Cai, you’ll know by giving it an appraisal,” said Gu Ning with a smile.

Hearing that, Cai Wenhong took a long breath in. Because he was too excited, he forgot to appraise them. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Even the two experts who came with him didn’t know where to start when standing in front of the bronze chimes.

Cai Wenhong did his best to calm himself down before conducting the appraisal.

These 65 bronze chimes needed to be identified one by one, because it was possible that some of them might be fake.

It wasn’t because he didn’t trust Gu Ning, but he had to be careful and do a serious appraisal.

The auction this time was very special, so the rules were naturally very strict.

Because there were too many bronze chimes, it took a long time to appraise all of them. Therefore, Gu Ning told Gao Yi and Qiao Ya to move over some chairs, tables and tea for them to have a break if they were tired.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya didn’t know what was in the basement until they walked in, but they knew little about antiques, so they weren’t very surprised to see the bronze chimes.

However, when they saw the excitement on the faces of the other people, they realized that the bronze chimes might be very valuable.

Anyway, their boss had countless valuable objects, so they thought Master Leng and the other people’s reaction was very normal.

They left after putting the tables, chairs, and tea down. Gu Ning sat by a table, enjoying the tea, waiting at the side.

“Real, this one is real!” They kept exclaiming.

“It’s so shocking! It’s a whole set. I can’t believe I have the opportunity to see a whole set of bronze chimes in my life. Even if I die right now, I’ll have no regrets.”

It was Jiang Zhongyu’s voice. He was the one who loved antiques the most among the people here, so he said that aloud.

Undoubtedly, he was just saying it.

“Ningning, you’re too unbelievable!” Master Xu complimented.

“Right!” Cai Wenhong agreed.

They knew the bronze chimes were illegal, but they also understood it wasn’t easy to find and bring them back.

“She’s my grand daughter-in-law! Of course she’s unbelievable,” said Master Leng with pride.

“Yeah, yeah, what else can you show off except for your granddaughter-in-law right now?” said Master Xu with slight jealousy.

“My grandson! He’s also very outstanding seeing as he won the heart of such a great girl like my granddaughter-in-law,” said Master Leng with satisfaction.

Master Xu and Jiang Zhongyu didn’t know what to say at this moment, because they had heard that from Master Leng countless times.

Being praised by Master Leng in public, Gu Ning felt quite happy.

Gu Ning had a faint smile on her lips. She could feel that Master Leng was very satisfied with her, so she took Master Leng as her family member too.

While they were appraising the bronze chimes, Gu Ning received a call from Nie Chenyang. He asked whether she had handed in the documents.

Gu Ning was surprised. “I did. During a break between classes on Thursday.”

Had someone done something to the documents? It sounded like a conspiracy theory, but Gu Ning was often schemed against by bad people.

“Oh, they must have been misplaced by one of our staff. I’ll look for them,” said Nie Chenyang. He didn’t connect it with a conspiracy.

“Sure,” said Gu Ning. She said nothing further about it, because she wasn’t sure whether someone had done something without her knowing it. Perhaps it was just an accident.

Half an hour later, Nie Chenyang called again and told her that he still didn’t find them.

“Gu Ning, I’m sorry. Can I send you the forms by email and you can fill them in on the computer before sending it back to me?” Nie Chenyang said feeling a little embarrassed. After all, they didn’t do their job well and had to bother Gu Ning.

“No problem.” Gu Ning understood it had nothing to do with Nie Chenyang, so she didn’t blame him for it.

Afterwards, Gu Ning told Nie Chenyang her email address and Nie Chenyang sent her an e-mail in two minutes.

Gu Ning gave a glance at Master Leng and the others. When no one paid attention to her, she directly took out a laptop from her telepathic eye space. She was too lazy to do it outside.

Without hesitation, she turned it on and downloaded the documents to fill in the forms. After that, she sent them back to Nie Chenyang.

Once Nie Chenyang received the documents, he sent Gu Ning a message.
