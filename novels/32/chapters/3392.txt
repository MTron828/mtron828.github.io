3393 Don’t Underestimate Her

“Does Mr. Xiao usually play games?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“I do play games, and I consider myself a game lover. Currently, I’m playing two of the most popular mobile games and have reached the diamond rank,” said Xiao Yuming. Although diamond wasn’t the highest rank, it wasn’t low. Not many people could reach it.

The game was graded as bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, master, and finally king.

However, the higher the level, the more difficult the levels became, so many people found it challenging to get a higher level and might even fall to the lower level.

“Well, let’s not talk about anything else. How about playing a round first, Mr. Xiao?” Leng Xiaoyao suggested.

“Okay.” Xiao Yuming also wanted to see what kind of game Leng Xiaoyao’s company had made. To be honest, he didn’t have high expectations for this small team and didn’t think that they could create a great game, but since he was here, he naturally needed to take a look.

Xiao Yuming didn’t promise to endorse the game right away. He needed to see how the game was first. If it was too bad, he couldn’t damage his reputation.

Leng Xiaoyao knew that too, so she proposed to play the game first.

Recently, all the employees in the company were playing the game, so they were already familiar with it. However, they had only played for a short time and were only in the bronze rank.

The game required teams of five people each. Leng Xiaoyao and Xiao Yuming were the captains of two teams. Mu Yufan and all the employees were on one side with four people, which was just enough.

Li Mochen watched Leng Xiaoyao play.

Since Xiao Yuming hadn’t played it before, Leng Xiaoyao explained and familiarized him with the game before starting.

The characters and scenes in the game made Xiao Yuming’s eyes light up. Although it wasn’t as popular as the two most popular games now, compared with those two games, it was equally impressive.

As he played, Xiao Yuming also became fascinated. Originally, he only wanted to play one game to see the quality and effect, but he played seven or eight rounds in a row and was defeated too badly by Leng Xiaoyao. He lost interest and stopped playing.

“Leng Xiaoyao, you’re really awesome!” Xiao Yuming was a bit unconvinced. He was too badly defeated.

“I programmed the game. Of course I’m awesome!” Leng Xiaoyao laughed.

“That’s true, but you’re really impressive. You can program such a good game with such a small team. This game is really amazing.” Xiao Yuming sincerely praised her.

“So can we continue to discuss our cooperation?” Leng Xiaoyao asked with a smile.

“Of course we can.” This time, Xiao Yuming was willing to endorse the game from his heart. He had promised to come here simply because of Li Mochen.

Therefore, the two sides discussed the details of the game in detail.

Due to his relationship with Li Mochen, Xiao Yuming agreed to endorse it as a friendly gesture without any endorsement fee. Even if Leng Xiaoyao insisted on paying him, he refused.

In the end, Leng Xiaoyao could only thank him and owed him a favor. If he needed help in the future, he could turn to her for help.

Xiao Yuming didn’t think that he had anything he needed from Leng Xiaoyao. No matter how impressive she was, she was still a weak girl.

Originally, Li Mochen didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to give Xiao Yuming the promise, but he felt uncomfortable when he saw Xiao Yuming’s distrustful look. “Don’t underestimate her. Except for connections and family background, her other abilities are no worse than mine.”

Xiao Yuming was surprised when he heard that, but he didn’t want to ask too many questions, so he accepted Leng Xiaoyao’s kindness.

Xiao Yuming really couldn’t imagine that he would need Leng Xiaoyao’s help in the near future. Since then, he admired Leng Xiaoyao even more than Li Mochen did.

They talked for an afternoon and signed the contract. After signing the contract, Leng Xiaoyao naturally invited Xiao Yuming to dinner. He accepted the invitation.

“Mochen, is Leng Xiaoyao really that good?” Xiao Yuming quietly asked Li Mochen.

“She can race against me to the finish line at the same time. She’s on par with me in hacking skills and physical abilities. She has good gambling skills, and she earned all the money to start her company on her own.” Li Muchen didn’t want Xiao Yuming to underestimate Leng Xiaoyao. Anyway, these were no longer secrets. The main thing was that he had a good relationship with Xiao Yuming. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have said so much.

“Oh my God!”

Upon hearing that, Xiao Yuming was surprised and unable to believe that such a young girl could be so amazing.

If someone else said that, he would definitely doubt it.

However, even though he believed it, he still couldn’t digest it.

Then, Xiao Yuming kept asking Leng Xiaoyao about her skills until Li Mochen became unhappy and told him to shut up.

Although Xiao Yuming didn’t want to shut up, he had no choice but to do so because he was afraid of Li Mochen. However, there were countless questions in his mind that he wanted to ask Leng Xiaoyao but couldn’t. It made him feel extremely upset.

After dinner, they separated.

Without An Chenmeng and Xiong Manxin around, Li Mochen went straight into Leng Xiaoyao’s house.

For the time being, he didn’t dare to do anything inappropriate. He just hugged and kissed her.

At 10 pm, he left obediently, although unwillingly.

The next day, Leng Xiaoyao went to school.

She was once again the most eye-catching student on campus, attracting many students’ attention.

The School of Economics and the School of Law weren’t in the same place, so she didn’t meet Mu Beihan, but she did meet Fan Xiaoyu.

Fan Xiaoyu was also studying economics.

Fan Xiaoyu didn’t pick a fight with her, but gave her a hateful look.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t mind.

The girl who was with Fan Xiaoyu was curious and asked her, “Xiaoyu, do you know that girl? Do you have a conflict with her?”

“I don’t know her.” Fan Xiaoyu replied, not wanting to say too much.

The girl pouted, knowing that Fan Xiaoyu wasn’t telling the truth. However, she couldn’t ask anything further.

At this time, a boy walked over to Leng Xiaoyao and greeted her. “Leng Xiaoyao, we meet again.”

The boy’s name was Ma Weiyuan. He was the third-place winner in the national competition last time. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Hello, Ma Weiyuan.” Leng Xiaoyao responded. Since he had a good attitude, her attitude naturally wouldn’t be bad either.

“Leng Xiaoyao, are you also majoring in economics?” Ma Weiyuan asked.

“Yes! Are you too?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Yeah, which class are you in? I’m in Class 2.” Ma Weiyuan asked because there were several classes for economics.

“I’m in Class 1,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“What a pity!” Ma Weiyuan smiled.

Ma Weiyuan was very handsome, so many people, who saw him chatting with Leng Xiaoyao, got jealous.

Good-looking people would always be pursued by the opposite sex, but rejected by the same sex, so male students might not like Ma Weiyuan, while female students might not like Leng Xiaoyao.
