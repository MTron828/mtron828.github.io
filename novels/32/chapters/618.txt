Chapter 619 Tang Qingyang

When one of them saw Gu Ning, his eyes lit up at once. “Hi, Miss Gu! What a coincidence!”

“Nice to see you, Mr, Jiang,” Gu Ning said politely, but kept a distance from him. The man was Jiang Ruiqin.

Jiang Ruiqin was thinking about Gu Ning all the time, and he even planned to run in the morning tomorrow again to meet her. To his surprise, they met again that night!

“Oh, you know each other already!” Song Nan smiled, then gave Jiang Ruiqin a glance. He noticed something different from Jiang Ruiqin’s reaction. It was obvious that he liked Gu Ning, but Gu Ning seemed calm. They had just met each other after all, and weren’t familiar yet.

“Hey, I’m here too! Didn’t you see me?” Xu Qinyin said with annoyance, feeling displeased at being ignored.

Jiang Ruiqin didn’t notice Xu Qinyin until she said that and felt a little embarrassed. “Hi, Qinyin!”

The Leng family, the Xu family and the Jiang family were very close, and the younger generation of them all grew up together.

“You know each other too?” Song Nan was astonished.

“Yes, we grew up together!” Xu Qinyin said with pride.

“Well, let me introduce you. This is my friend, Tang Qingyang. He was studying abroad and just came home.” Jiang Ruiqin introduced the man who came with him to the others.

Hearing the name Tang Qingyang, Gu Ning was shocked, and looked to him at once. He still looked the same. He was back! Tang Qingyang was Tang Aining’s younger cousin and owned 15% shares of the Tang family’s business group in the capital.

The Tang family in the capital had three brothers. The eldest brother was Tang Bingsen, the younger brother was Tang Qingyang’s father, Tang Bingchao, and the youngest brother was Tang Bingjiang who was in his early forties and had a 17-year-old son as well as a 13-year-old daughter.

In addition to Tang Bingsen’s 51% stake in the business group, Tang Bingchao and Tang Bingjiang each had 15%, and the rest was held by other shareholders and the market. However, three years ago, Tang Bingchao had died in a car accident, so his 15% shares fell into Tang Qingyang’s hands.

An idea dawned on Gu Ning. She thought that it wouldn’t be a bad idea to cooperate with Tang Qingyang to gain complete control of the Tang family’s business group. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Tang Bingsen was the mastermind behind the death Tang Qingyang’s father, and Tang Qingyang must have sensed something when he was younger, so he had decided to study abroad all of a sudden. If so, he must have come back now for a reason. However, it would be hard for Tang Qingyang to defeat the Tang family alone, unless he had powerful allies.

In Gu Ning’s previous incarnation, Tang Yaxin and Qi Ziyue gathered a group of armed men to kill her. The Tang family had support from an armed gang. Although the gang was barely comparable with the Qing Gang or the Kirin Gang, it was threatening enough in ordinary people’s eyes.

Only a few people knew the name and location of the armed gang behind the Tang family. Even Gu Ning, herself knew very little about it. In her previous incarnation, she was merely a killing machine in Tang Bingsen’s eyes, so it was impossible that Tang Bingsen would allow her to know much about his secrets.

However, Gu Ning wasn’t afraid of Tang Bingsen’s power at all. Instead, she was quite interested in ruining his power. At the same time, Gu Ning had no intention to be the chairman of the Tang family’s business group, because she preferred to build up her own business empire. In that case, if Tang Qingyang wanted to take over the Tang family’s business group, she was willing to help him.

Tang Qingyang also noticed Gu Ning looking at him differently, but he didn’t take it seriously. They greeted each other, then sat down.

Before long, Xu Qinyin’s other friend arrived. It was a 25-year-old sexy woman. She was wearing a tight dress, which accentuated her figure, and she attracted a lot of attention from men in the bar when she walked over. Even Song Nan and the others who had seen countless beautiful women before couldn’t help giving her glances.

“Hi, everyone!” She walked up to them and flipped her hair, which was quite alluring. Even her voice sounded sexy. Saying that, she sat right next to Song Nan and said, “We meet again, handsome guy!”

“Don’t you see the two really handsome men in front of you?” Song Nan said with annoyance.

“Well, why are you so displeased with it? I’m not making fun of you.” She rolled her eyes at Song Nan. Even though she was rolling her eyes, she still seemed very attractive, as if she was born a stunner.

“You...” Song Nan didn’t know what to say. He always failed in an argument with her.

Xu Qinyin laughed, then introduced the woman to them. “Let me introduce you. This is my friend, Gu Anna.”

After that, she introduced the others to Gu Anna.

“Hi, Gu Ning, have we met before? You look so familiar,” Gu Anna said to Gu Ning, but she sounded like she was flirting with Gu Ning.

Gu Ning understood that Gu Anna was serious, but she was sure that this was the first time they had met each other.

“Maybe,” Gu Ning replied with a smile.

Gu Ning didn’t care about it, but Gu Anna fell into deep thought. She thought that she must have seen Gu Ning’s face somewhere before.

All of a sudden, Gu Anna took out her phone and searched Gu Ning’s name on the Internet. “Oh, it’s really you. Goddess Gu!” she exclaimed with excitement.
