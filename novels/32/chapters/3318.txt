3321 Too Bold

“Humph! You want to use violence? That depends on whether you have the ability to do so.” Leng Xiaoyao was tired of acting. Although she didn’t blame Li Mochen for dragging her into trouble, the actions of the Li family angered her.

She was totally innocent in the conflicts between the Li family and Li Mochou, but the Li family came after her. How could she not be angry?

The Li family really had no sense of reason and were just bullying others!

The two men were stunned. They couldn’t understand why Leng Xiaoyao suddenly lost her fear, and even dared to look down on them.

However, they didn’t think that Leng Xiaoyao was capable of anything.

“Well then, don’t blame us for being impolite.” The next moment, the two men attacked Leng Xiaoyao.

“Don’t blame you? Do you think I’m a saint? If you offend me, you will pay the price.” Leng Xiaoyao said coldly and immediately fought back.

These two men were nothing but small fries to Leng Xiaoyao. She easily knocked them down and even dislocated their arms.

The two men were surprised. They didn’t expect this girl to be so powerful.

“Did you think I didn’t know that you’ve been following me since the capital city? If I guessed correctly, you should have been sent by the Li family,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

The two men were startled, their expressions revealing panic. Obviously, they had been caught by Leng Xiaoyao.

At the same time, they were also surprised that Leng Xiaoyao had discovered them while she was still in the capital city and even knew that they were related to the Li family.

Although Leng Xiaoyao had defeated them, she didn’t intend to let them go. She called the police and also informed Leng Yecheng.

She decided to make these two people stay in the police station for a while, but was afraid that they wouldn’t listen to her. Therefore, she thought it would be better to call Leng Yecheng. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The police arrived first. Although Leng Xiaoyao was the victim, she still needed to go to the police station to give her statement.

Shortly after Leng Xiaoyao arrived at the police station, Leng Yecheng arrived.

During the statement, Leng Xiaoyao said that when she got off at a certain section of XX Road, these two men also got off and tried to catch her. She acted in self-defense and injured them.

“I know I hurt them and it’s wrong, but I was only acting in self-defense. If it were an ordinary girl without any martial arts skills, wouldn’t she have been abducted by them? What would have happened to her after that? Would she be forced to engage in illegal activities or have her organs dug out?” Leng Xiaoyao said indignantly, as if she had already concluded that they were human traffickers.

Leng Yecheng added. “Officer, these people are too audacious. They dare to kidnap people during the day. I don’t believe that they haven’t done this kind of thing before. Although the Leng family in City Chang isn’t a very important family, we still have some influence. We can’t tolerate this kind of injustice. It’s best to find out who the mastermind behind this is.”

“Don’t worry, Mr. Leng. We will definitely investigate this matter thoroughly,” said the police officer in charge of taking the statement, taking Leng Yecheng’s status into account.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t mention that she had discovered their plan at the airport in the capital city, nor did she reveal that they were sent by the Li family. She knew it was unlikely that the police station would be able to find out who was behind this.

She also knew that these people were unlikely to mention the Li family because they were afraid of retaliation. Even if they did, the Li family might not acknowledge it. They were capable of such despicable acts, but they would probably not admit to them.

She understood that there were many people watching the Li family now. Even if Li Mochen didn’t take action, the Li family might not be able to stay out of trouble, unless they were powerful enough.

However, after learning about why the Li family wanted Li Mochen back, she knew that the Li family was gradually declining and was now facing enemies on all sides.

Therefore, it wasn’t easy to find something on them.

In all fairness, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t seem like someone who would frame them, so after taking her statement, she was allowed to leave while the two men were further interrogated.

At the same time, the police retrieved surveillance footage from the starting point of their journey.

The story was consistent with what Leng Xiaoyao had said. The two men had been following her all along and attacked her first when she got off the car. Leng Xiaoyao only fought back in self-defense.

Anyway, Leng Xiaoyao’s counterattack was too brilliant! It was like defeating the enemy in one move.

“What exactly did the two men do?” Leng Yecheng asked on the way back, not quite believing Leng Xiaoyao’s statements at the police station because she had gotten out of the taxi before reaching home. It made him think that she had noticed she was being followed earlier on.

Leng Xiaoyao knew that Leng Yecheng wasn’t easily fooled, but she still didn’t tell him everything. “I noticed they were following me right after I left the airport. They followed me all the way home. They said they needed my help with something, but I couldn’t get any information out of them. So I don’t know if they’re human traffickers or if someone sent them.”

“Could it be the Gao family?” Leng Yecheng was the first to suspect the Gao family. Once he mentioned them, he got angry. “Why didn’t you tell me about Gao Qilu throwing sulfuric acid on you?”

He wasn’t just angry at the Gao family.

He was also angry at Xiaoyao for letting such a serious thing go so easily.

“I didn’t tell you because nothing happened! I didn’t want you to worry. Oh, does Grandpa know?” Xiaoyao was a little nervous, but mostly worried.

Leng Yecheng knew, but he could handle it. However, Leng Changyuan was old and couldn’t bear such stress.

“He doesn’t know. I investigated it myself because I felt something wasn’t right. If it was just a simple conflict between you and Gao Qilu, Gao Zhongheng wouldn’t have brought her to apologize. You know how much they look down on us. And those news articles online, you wrote them, right?” Leng Yecheng asked confidently.

He knew that Leng Xiaoyao had already taught Gao Qilu a lesson, so there was nothing else that could have caused such a big impact on the Gao family except for those online articles.

Leng Xiaoyao was a hacker, so it was easy for her to do such things.

“Yeah! Do you think I would let her go so easily? However, since nothing happened publicly, it’s not good for our family to keep holding onto it. Besides, she’s had enough this time,” Leng Xiaoyao said, not proud of what she had done, but just stating the facts.
