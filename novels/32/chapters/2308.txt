Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Xu Jinchen was stunned by Leng Shaoting’s scolding. After hanging up, he didn’t come back to his senses until a couple of moments later. He thought that Leng Shaoting might have encountered something unpleasant. Therefore, he was slightly worried and hesitated to call Leng Shaoting again.

However, Leng Shaoting hung up on him so fast, which meant it wasn’t convenient for Leng Shaoting to answer a call now. It might not be a good idea for him to call Leng Shaoting once more.

“What? Won’t Shaoting come?”

Seeing the worry on Xu Jinchen’s face, Xu Jinlin asked.

“Shaoting said he’s occupied. He can’t come. He shouted that don’t call him again unless there is something very important. I’m just a little worried,” said Xu Jinchen.

He had many guesses, but never thought that he had interrupted Leng Shaoting in the middle of having sex with Gu Ning.

Hearing that, Xu Jinlin frowned and comforted him. “Perhaps he’s dealing with something important. Don’t worry, Shaoting isn’t weak. He can handle it.”

Because it was still early and wasn’t 10 pm yet, Xu Jinlin had no idea about what Leng Shaoting was really doing at this time.

Right, Leng Shaoting was very strong and he would be fine. Thinking of that, Xu Jinchen felt relieved.

Gu Ning, however, snorted with laughter. “Really? Do you think it’s a good idea?”

“Of course, you’re much more enjoyable than drinks,” said Leng Shaoting with an evil smile, then threw himself at Gu Ning.

Gu Ning turned around and pressed Leng Shaoting against the sofa. The next second, she opened her legs and sat on his crotch. Her body was so close to his. Looking at him, she said amorously, “You are on top every time. This time, I’ll be on top.”

As she said that, her heart was pounding faster. In fact, she was shy and nervous, because it was a bold move for her.

They had been together for a long time, so Gu Ning felt they could experiment a bit more in sex and try something different. Anyway, she was alone with him now. It was their private time.

Facing Gu Ning’s boldness, Leng Shaoting got excited. He couldn’t wait to see what she would do next.

“Great, you’ll take the lead today.” Leng Shaoting smiled happily.

Gu Ning avoided his eyes a little and regretted doing it all of a sudden, but it was too late to get down now.

Alright, then she would ride him till the end!

Without delay, Gu Ning began to kiss his lips. His face, his nose, his jaw, his Adam’s apple, and his chest…

Her hand moved slowly downwards, making Leng Shaoting tremble a little with pleasure. He was completely aroused. However, he didn’t want to stop Gu Ning, so he tolerated it no matter how uncomfortable it was. Actually, he was enjoying it and felt happy that his girl wanted to learn to get him excited now.

“How is it? Is it uncomfortable?” Gu Ning deliberately did it at a slow speed to make Leng Shaoting suffer. Looking at his reaction, she felt sorry for him, but had to admit that it was very pleasant.

“Ningning, when can you let me in?” Leng Shaoting stared at Gu Ning, looking pitiful.

“Now.”

The atmosphere in the room turned sexy, and they didn’t stop until they were both exhausted.

“Ningning, I need to ask you about something,” said Leng Shaoting seriously all of a sudden.

Staring at his serious face, Gu Ning became serious too. “What is it?”

“Did I get better in bed?” Leng Shaoting asked with a serious expression.

Gu Ning instantly flushed red. She turned her eyes away and didn’t dare to look at him. She thought it was something important, but unexpectedly it was so embarrassing. However, it was actually very important for a man.

No man wanted his woman to not approve of his sequel prowess, because sexual pleasure was happiness.

“Does your silence mean I didn’t get better?” After waiting for a while, Leng Shaoting still didn’t get an answer from Gu Ning, so he became a little upset. He had confidence in himself, but he needed to hear the answer from Gu Ning’s mouth.

“Are you serious?” Gu Ning felt that he definitely got better in bed, but she felt too shy to answer that question.

“Isn’t it serious enough? Do you feel you can’t answer it right now, I’ll work harder to help you figure out the answer,” said Leng Shaoting, then he immediately turned and pressed Gu Ning under him. It seemed he would keep on penetrating her if she refused to give him an answer.

“You…” Gu Ning was annoyed. She realized that she had to give him an answer. Therefore, even if she was quite embarrassed, she still said, “Yeah, you’re much better now.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was satisfied and the smile on his face became broader. However, it wasn’t over yet, and Leng Shaoting continued to ask her, “Do you like it?”

“How can you have so many questions?” Gu Ning argued.

“If you don’t answer my question, it means you don’t like it and you don’t think I got better,” said Leng Shaoting. He suddenly became stubborn.

Gu Ning was speechless. Since when did he like to go down a dead end?

“Of course I like it,” said Gu Ning in the end.

“Do you want more?” Leng Shaoting continued.

“No,” said Gu Ning, because she was exhausted.

“Then you don’t actually like it, and you don’t think…” Leng Shaoting said the same thing again. He was forcing Gu Ning to say that he was much better in bed now, and she really liked it and wanted more.

Gu Ning could say that he was much better now and she really liked it, but she was too shy to say that she wanted more. However, she knew she couldn’t dodge the question, so she decided to satisfy Leng Shaoting’s needs.

“Yeah, I want more.” Gu Ning interrupted before Leng Shaoting could finish.

Upon hearing that, Leng Shaoting got excited again, but he didn’t move right away, and continued to ask, “What do you want?”

“I want…” Gu Ning flushed again and avoided Leng Shaoting’s eyes.

“What?” Leng Shaoting swallowed and asked again. His eyes were full of burning desire.

Gu Ning took a deep breath and gave in. “I want you.”

In an instant, Leng Shaoting lost control of himself and directly penetrated Gu Ning.

After a short break, they had a passionate sex once more. However, because both of them had used a lot of strength, this time, it didn’t last long, but they still didn’t stop until they were completely out of strength.

Leng Shaoting felt a little sorry, but he just couldn’t control himself in front of Gu Ning..𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
