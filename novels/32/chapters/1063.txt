Chapter 1065 Encounter Aimee

However, a man by Zhao Yuefeng’s side was displeased, and said with a cold face, “You’re just a young girl. How much can you know about stone gambling?”

Zhao Yuefeng was a little annoyed. “Chairman Wu, Miss Gu is my friend, so please show some respect.”

“You...” Chairman Wu was mad when Zhao Yuefeng sided with Gu Ning. “Fine, if you want to listen to a young girl, do as you like.” After that, he walked away.

Zhao Yuefeng ignored him, and apologized to Gu Ning, “Miss Gu, please don’t mind it. He’s always like that.”

“It’s fine.” Gu Ning smiled. She wouldn’t be mad at a stranger.

Afterwards, Gu Ning glanced at those jade raw materials placed on the stand, then said to Zhao Yuefeng in a low voice, “Look at the F-1003 jade raw material. I think there might be jade in it.”

There was a piece of medium-high-level jade in it, and Gu Ning said that to give Zhao Yuefeng a hint.

Zhao Yuefeng understood it and he also trusted Gu Ning. “Thanks, Miss Gu.”

“You’re welcome. I’m afraid that I’ve gotta go now,” Gu Ning said.

“See you,” Zhao Yuefeng said and didn’t stop Gu Ning.

Once Gu Ning was gone, Zhao Yuefeng wrote the number of that jade raw material down. He believed that there was jade in it, so he made a much higher bid for it to make sure that it would be his.

...

It seemed that Gu Ning was fated to meet more than one familiar face at this public jade bid in Burma, because after walking for a short while, she ran into Aimee Hill.

Aimee came here along with her older brother, Adam Hill. Adam held no grudge against Gu Ning, but Aimee did.

Aimee had tried to kill Gu Ning in vain before, so Gu Ning wouldn’t let her get away with it this time.

When Aimee saw Gu Ning, she was scared, because she remembered Gu Ning’s warning. She was born in the Hill family, but her older brother had told her that their family wouldn’t help her if she annoyed Gu Ning.

Gu Ning had a close relationship with Situ Ye after all, and Situ Ye cared a lot about Gu Ning too.

Aimee was still jealous of Gu Ning, and she still hated Gu Ning, because Situ Ye liked Gu Ning and Gu Ning had injured her.

Thinking of that, Aimee thought that she should teach Gu Ning a lesson.

Gu Ning stayed calm and didn’t care what Aimee was thinking. She didn’t forget what Aimee had done to her, but she had no intention to deliberately get back at Aimee. However, Aimee showed up in her sight today, and there was no reason for her to miss this chance.

Besides, if Aimee had avoided meeting her and kept a distance from her, she would be kind and let her go, but Aimee just had to do the opposite. Therefore, Gu Ning understood that she must do something to stop Aimee from hurting her again.

The second Leng Shaoting saw Aimee’s expression, he knew that this woman had a grudge against Gu Ning, so he gave her a cold glance.

Aimee felt threatened by that glance, and moved her eyes away in fear. Adam also got nervous when he saw Gu Ning’s expression, and gave Aimee a warning glance to tell her not to annoy Gu Ning.

Nevertheless, Adam didn’t know many details of what Aimee had done to Gu Ning, or he wouldn’t be so optimistic.

“Miss Gu, nice to see you again,” Adam politely greeted Gu Ning.

“Nice to see you too, Adam,” Gu Ning said.

Adam didn’t know Leng Shaoting, so he just nodded at him. Leng Shaoting did the same.

Gu Ning planned to get revenge on Aimee, but not now, because in her eyes it was more important to find good jade.

“Adam, if you don’t mind, we need to go over there,” Gu Ning said.

“Please,” Adam said and stepped aside to let Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting pass.

When Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were far away, Adam warned Aimee again, “Aimee, don’t ever think to hurt that girl again. If you cause any trouble to our family, nobody will help you. If Arthur gets the goods on us, our family will be in a dangerous situation.”

Arthur Hill was also a member of the Hill family. He was Aimee’s older cousin. Although the Hill family looked to be harmonious, the young generation were competing against each other for the right of inheritance.

It was unavoidable in a powerful family, and Leng Shaoting was going through the same thing. The Tang family in City B was very special and different in that situation. It really wasn’t common among super-rich or powerful families.

“I understand,” Aimee said, but she lied.

Adam didn’t have much time to teach Aimee to behave herself, so he kept on looking at jade raw materials.

The Hill family was also involved in the jewelry industry. Except for Adam and Aimee, Arthur and Yak also came here on behalf of the Hill family.

It was a test laid down by the Hill family for them. Although Adam was always the best out of the younger generation, he had to continue to compete against the other children in their family to become the sole heir.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
