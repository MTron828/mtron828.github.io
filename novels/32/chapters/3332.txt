3333 Do Whatever You Want to Do

They wanted to joke about Leng Xiaoyao, but once they entered the house, they forgot about it and began to appreciate the beauty of the place.

“Why do I feel like this style is so cold and erotic? I prefer the pink princess style,” An Chenmeng said, somewhat disdainfully.

Cold and erotic? Wasn’t that exactly how Li Mochen was? This was his house after all, and he liked the style that suited him.

Although Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t cold and erotic, she was still very satisfied with the style.

“I think it’s great!” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“I also think it suits you well,” An Chenmeng said.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t know what to say. She only said that it was great, not that it suited her!

Leng Xiaoyao arranged their rooms, with An Chenmeng and Xiong Manxin sharing one room, Wu Minmin and Tong Xiaobei sharing another, while Leng Xiaoyao slept in the master bedroom alone. No one had any objections.

They all knew that when staying in someone else’s place, they should stay in the guest rooms. None of them was so narcissistic as to think that they had to sleep in the master bedroom just because they had a close relationship with Leng Xiaoyao.

“Have a rest first and search online for travel guides. We’ll decide where to go this afternoon,” said Leng Xiaoyao.

“Okay, let’s take a look.”

After browsing for a while…

An Chenmeng suggested. “Boss, it’s already afternoon and we don’t have enough time to go far. Let’s go to the Qingyi Gardens today! We can also take a look at the entrance of the Capital University.”

“Sure.”

After making the decision, they packed up and headed out.

Leng Xiaoyao sent a message to Li Mochen, informing him that they were going out and invited him to join them for dinner if he had time.

Li Mochen had plenty of time, so he waited at home eagerly for their arrival.

They took a taxi to the Capital University and as soon as they got off, An Chenmeng and her friends went crazy taking pictures, including group photos and selfies.

Although the students at the Capital University were very good at studying, their behavior couldn’t be guaranteed.

For example, a few girls who saw An Chenmeng and her friends taking pictures outside the school gate looked down on them.

Especially when they heard Wu Minmin say she didn’t know if she would ever have a chance to enter the school again, and that it wasn’t easy to get into it, they even sneered and said, “Do you think everyone can study in the Capital University? You bunch of bumpkins should be grateful just to see the entrance.”

They deliberately said this to provoke Wu Minmin and her friends, so Leng Xiaoyao and the others heard it.

They had become more docile under Leng Xiaoyao’s guidance, but they were still not easy to deal with. Once they were provoked, they would become aggressive.

“Who are you talking to?” Wu Minmin shouted at the girls.

“I’m talking to you, bumpkin.” The girl admitted it without hesitation.

“Oh! I thought students from the Capital University not only have excellent academic performance but also have noble character! I didn’t expect there to be such a snobbish woman!” An Chenmeng immediately walked over and mocked.

“What did you say?” The girl was angry in an instant.

“I’m talking about you, you stupid, snobbish woman,” An Chenmeng said, unafraid even though they were on the other’s turf.

In fact, they didn’t want to swallow their anger because Leng Xiaoyao was present.

Leng Xiaoyao had no intention of stopping her. If she did, An Chenmeng wouldn’t have had the chance to say anything.

“You…” The girl was so angry that she wanted to rush over and hit them, but she was held back by the two girls beside her. “Xiaoxiao, don’t be impulsive. It’s not good to make a scene.”

“Let go of me, or you won’t be my friends anymore.” Jiang Xiaoxiao threatened angrily.

Hearing that, the two girls had to let her go.

Jiang Xiaoxiao immediately rushed towards An Chenmeng, ready to hit her. However, before her hand could fall, she was grabbed by Leng Xiaoyao. With Leng Xiaoyao around, An Chenmeng didn’t need to take the risk of whether she could stop or dodge Jiang Xiaoxiao.

“You…”

Jiang Xiaoxiao was furious and glared at the person who grabbed her, but after a glance, she was stunned by Leng Xiaoyao’s face. She felt that Leng Xiaoyao looked familiar, but she couldn’t remember where she had seen her.

In addition, Leng Xiaoyao was extremely beautiful.

Jiang Xiaoxiao got jealous and it showed on her face.

“Do you know what it means to be the first to provoke?” Leng Xiaoyao said coldly, “You pick a fight and then resort to violence when you can’t win the argument. Do you think you’re the only one who’s allowed to do that? Who do you think you are?

Even if this girl had a powerful background, Leng Xiaoyao would still resist if she was unreasonable.

After saying that, Leng Xiaoyao directly threw Jiang Xiaoxiao’s hand away. Jiang Xiaoxiao stumbled and almost fell.

“You… Do you know who I am? You’ve offended me, and you’ll regret it.” Jiang Xiaoxiao was angry.

“What? Can you only threaten people with your family? If you’re capable, show me what you can do on your own. What’s the point of relying on your parents’ status and money? Those who are truly capable don’t run to their parents at every turn, but solve things on their own.” Leng Xiaoyao sneered and mocked. Her words drew the attention of those around them who all agreed with her. They looked at Jiang Xiaoxiao with disdain.

She had no ability, so she used her family to threaten others. It was really shameless.

Some of this contempt came from justice, but some of it was also due to envy. They also wanted a powerful family background but didn’t have one, so they hated those who bullied others with their power.

Jiang Xiaoxiao’s face turned red because other than relying on her family, she indeed didn’t have any real abilities! Her only skill was getting into the Capital University based on her own effort.

However, it was easier for locals in the capital city to get into the Capital University than for outsiders. The score line for outsiders was 680 points while the score line for locals was 630 points.

Jiang Xiaoxiao’s score for entering the Capital University was 635 points, which was only a few points higher than the score line.

Leng Xiaoyao ignored Jiang Xiaoxiao and directly called An Chenmeng and the others to leave.

They left first, not because they were afraid of trouble, but because they didn’t want to cause trouble.

However, in the eyes of Jiang Xiaoxiao, they were just afraid of trouble, so she provocatively said, “You talk as if you’re so capable. Why are you walking away so quickly?”

Jiang Xiaoxiao only wanted to salvage a bit of her pride, and didn’t actually want to continue to tangle with Leng Xiaoyao and her friends. After all, they were at the gate of their school and she didn’t dare to make a scene.

When Leng Xiaoyao heard that, she turned around and walked back to Jiang Xiaoxiao. With a smirk on her face, she asked with interest, “Oh, what else do you want? I’m happy to wait.”
