3282 Do You Know Who My Grandfather Is?

Jin Yiai complained to An Chenjun. “Chenjun, did you see how she spoke of me? I only wanted to invite you to dinner, but she accused and humiliated me like this. Such a woman doesn’t deserve you at all.”

Jin Yiai seemed to think that An Chenjun would help her.

However, he didn’t help her, and sided with Shen Xiyin. “Since Miss Jin doesn’t want to be misunderstood, it’s better not to casually invite men who have a girlfriend to dinner. Otherwise, even I will misunderstand. Also, whether my girlfriend deserves me or not is not something an outsider like you has the right to judge.”

Jin Yiai was angry and aggrieved when she saw that An Chenjun didn’t help her and sided with Shen Xiyin. She almost cried. “Chenjun, you clearly know my intentions…”

“So, are you really the kind of person Xiyin said?” An Chenjun asked.

“I…” Jin Yiai was struck dumb for a second, and didn’t know what to say.

If she said yes, she would lose face. If she denied it, then it meant she really liked An Chenjun.

“Yiai, we should go!” Jin Yiai’s companion felt that they couldn’t stay there any longer and immediately pulled her away.

Jin Yiai couldn’t stand it either. Once her friend said that, she left with them.

At the same time, her resentment towards Shen Xiyin grew even stronger.

If it hadn’t been for Shen Xiyin, An Chenjun would have become her boyfriend.

It was ridiculous.

If it hadn’t been for Shen Xiyin, An Chenjun would have become her boyfriend? That was too presumptuous. Jin Yiai was too confident for no reason.

An Chenjun and Jin Yiai were just high school classmates. It was Jin Yiai who had secretly been in love with him all along. An Chenjun had never shown any interest in her.

After Jin Yiai left, An Chenjun breathed a sigh of relief and cautiously glanced at Shen Xiyin. When he saw that she wasn’t angry, he felt relieved.

Seeing An Chenjun’s reaction, Shen Xiyin couldn’t help but laugh and her mood was instantly lifted. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Do you think I’m the kind of unreasonable person who would be angry about this? The one who’s wrong is Jin Yiai, not you,” Shen Xiyin said.

“But it’s partly my fault too. If Jin Yiai hadn’t come to bother me, you wouldn’t have been annoyed,” An Chenjun said. He also hated Jin Yiai very much.

He loved Shen Xiyin, so he had to consider her feelings. Moreover, Shen Xiyin had left her hometown to be with him, so he had to take good care of her.

…

Jin Yiai was determined to make things difficult for Shen Xiyin.

After dealing with Lin Lipeng’s matter, Leng Xiaoyao took the others out for a meal.

After eating, Leng Xiaoyao went back home.

Leng Changyuan saw Leng Xiaoyao come back early, but he was already used to it, so he didn’t say too much about it.

Leng Xiaoyao told Leng Changyuan that she won the championship in the High School Liberal Arts Defense today, which made Leng Changyuan very happy. “Yaoyao, I’m so proud of you!”

“Ha-ha, as your granddaughter I can’t embarrass you,” Leng Xiaoyao said with satisfaction. She deliberately pleased Leng Changyuan, filling him with happiness.

“What gift do you want?” Leng Changyuan asked.

Although Leng Xiaoyao didn’t lack anything and could buy what she wanted herself, she was happy to receive a gift from Leng Changyuan because it showed his love for her.

After thinking for a moment, Leng Xiaoyao said, “How about getting me a new phone?”

Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t think of another gift other than a new phone!

She had used the current phone for two years, so it was time to get a new one.

“Okay, I’ll have your uncle buy you the latest phone tomorrow,” said Leng Changyuan.

“Thank you, grandpa. You’re the best!” Leng Xiaoyao exclaimed, hugging Leng Changyuan’s arm and acting cute.

…

The Chu family was unable to find the person who had attacked Chu Jianan, so they had to give up. Even if they had suspicions, there was no evidence to act upon.

…

In City Qin.

It was already 1 am. Mu Yiyang and the others were already asleep, while Li Mochen was cultivating.

These days, whenever he was alone, he would cultivate and he gradually became proficient in controlling the chaotic energy within his body.

They monitored the Island of Bones in turns.

In order to facilitate their departure, they had rented a yacht that could accommodate about ten people and was parked on the shore. If they discovered anything, they could immediately set off.

At 1:35 am, the person monitoring the surveillance noticed a boat approaching the Island of Bones and immediately notified Mu Yiyang, who then informed Li Mochen.

They continued to monitor the situation until the boat reached the Island of Bones, then Li Mochan and the others set off.

When Li Mochen and the others were halfway there, the boat had already docked at the Island of Bones. Many people had disembarked, some of whom were tied up. It was obvious that these people had been captured.

“They have captured about twenty people. These people are really brazen,” said Mu Yiyang angrily.

Those who were tied up didn’t want to go, but if they didn’t, they would be beaten. As a result, they had no choice but to go.

To avoid being seen by someone on the boat, Li Mochen and the others approached from another direction. After getting closer, they left two people to guard the yacht while the rest went to the island.

Li Mochen’s magical senses didn’t have the same range as Leng Xiaoyao’s, but he had a strong sense of direction and didn’t take many wrong turns, so they quickly arrived near the cave.

Because there were many poisonous snakes and insects on the island, they had prepared in advance by sprinkling realgar powder on themselves, so they didn’t get bitten on their way.

Adding to that, Li Mochen occasionally released a chaotic power, which kept even snakes and insects away.

As they approached the cave, they stopped and Li Mochen instructed them to wait while he checked the situation.

Although Mu Yiyang and the others were worried, they knew that Li Mochen was the most capable of them all. So they could only listen to him.

Li Mochen also warned them not to take any action without his signal, no matter what the situation was.

Although it was their mission, they didn’t mind following Li Mochen’s lead.

To them, completing the task was more important than taking credit.

Besides, Li Mochen never cared about credit and always shared it with them. That was why they were grateful to him.

And even if Li Mochen did want all the credit, they wouldn’t mind giving it to him since it was his achievement in the first place.
