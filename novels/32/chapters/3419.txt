3420 Want to Drink Bubble Tea

At that time, the company would be given to Leng Yecheng, and they would also be taken care of by Leng Yecheng. The house where Li Mochen currently lived would also be given to Leng Yecheng. It wouldn’t be used anyway.

Tang Xing and his sister would live an affluent life for the rest of their lives.

Leng Xiaoyao also hoped that Leng Yecheng could marry a kind wife in the future who could accept Tang Xing and Tang Ning.

She wouldn’t force him, but if her aunt could take care of her cousins, it would be for the best. Even if she didn’t like it, she couldn’t bully them either. They could just treat each other as relatives. Anyway, Tang Xing and Tang Ning didn’t need to rely on them for food and drink.

Leng Xiaoyao knew that her uncle wouldn’t mistreat Tang Xing and Tang Ning. Whether Leng Xiaoyao gave the company to him or not, she just didn’t want to make things difficult for him because of Tang Xing and Tang Ning.

She would arrange these things before going to Guiyun because she didn’t know what the result would be. Even if she would come back, she didn’t know when.

Leng Xiaoyao called Mu Yufan and asked if he had time tomorrow.

Mu Yufan said yes, so Leng Xiaoyao arranged for him to take Tang Xing and Tang Ning to the hospital for a comprehensive examination and a paternity test.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t hide anything and directly said that she suspected they were her cousins, but he shouldn’t tell Tang Xing before the test came out.

Mu Yufan agreed readily.

Tang Xing and Tang Ning were tired today, so Leng Xiaoyao let them rest first.

Since Tang Ning was still young and couldn’t adapt to being separated from Tang Xing for the time being, Leng Xiaoyao allowed them to sleep together.

Anyway, Tang Ning was still very young. They ate and slept together for the past few years, so it was safe. Leng Xiaoyao would teach Tang Ning how to sleep alone later.

At the same time, she told Tang Xing that tomorrow a big brother named Mu Yufan, the person whose number was saved in their phone, would come to pick them up to go to the hospital for an examination, so they didn’t have to be afraid.

Tang Xing wasn’t a cowardly person. He knew that Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t harm them, so he wasn’t afraid either.

Leng Xiaoyao needed to leave tomorrow, so she put a key and some of her hair in a bag.

Her air was wrapped in an envelope, and she asked Tang Xing to give it to Mu Yufan.

Because Mu Yufan was temporarily in charge of their food and drink, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t give them money.

The Tang siblings lay on the bed and couldn’t fall asleep for a long time. They were still skeptical whether all of this was real and worried that they would wake up and find out that it was just a dream.

“Brother, did the kind sister really save us? Did she really bring us to her house? Can we live here together in the future?” Tang Ning asked, afraid that it was all an illusion and they would wake up to find nothing.

“It’s true. The kind sister really saved us and brought us to her house. We can live here in the future. We can also go to school, and not be afraid of our uncle.” Tang Xing comforted his sister. Although he was also worried that it was all an illusion, he was more willing to believe that it was true.

If he wasn’t so weak, they wouldn’t have had to live like animals for several years.

Leng Xiaoyao, however, didn’t sleep and instead opened the box and looked through everything. Finally, she found an old family photo at the bottom of the box. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In the photo, there was a girl of sixteen years old who was obviously Tang Yue when she was young.

It meant that Tang Yue didn’t disappear when she was a child, but after she was about sixteen years old.

Therefore, Tang Yue’s disappearance might have another hidden motive. In other words, she might have been schemed against by someone.

Leng Xiaoyao had to investigate it thoroughly. If Tang Yue was really murdered, she wouldn’t let the killer get away with it.

Early the next morning, Leng Xiaoyao went to school. Mu Yufan arrived at 9 am. The Tang siblings had already prepared themselves and were ready for the day.

To facilitate Mu Yufan’s access, Leng Xiaoyao had already arranged an access card for Mu Yufan’s car, so Mu Yufan could freely enter Hanlin Manor.

As a precaution, Tang Xing also called Mu Yufan’s phone when he arrived.

Mu Yufan knew that Leng Xiaoyao had given them his phone number, so they could call him if they needed help, but he didn’t know their phone number, so he answered when the phone rang.

When Mu Yufan answered the call, Tang Xing finally felt relieved.

Mu Yufan appreciated Tang Xing’s vigilance. Being cautious was a good thing.

Then Mu Yufan took them to the hospital for various tests and also did a paternity test.

However, they would only get the results in the afternoon, so after their morning check-up, Mu Yufan took them out for lunch.

“What do you guys like to eat?” Mu Yufan asked them.

“Whatever is fine, Brother Mu,” Tang Xing said. When he was still a rich young heir, he was picky about food, but after three years of experiencing poverty, as long as it was clean and could fill their stomachs, it was good enough.

“I want to drink bubble tea, Brother Mu, can we?” Tang Ning saw a nearby bubble tea shop with a long line and suddenly wanted to drink it. She used to like to drink bubble tea and her mother would buy it for her.

Unfortunately, after they had an accident, she never drank bubble tea again.

Tang Xing wanted to stop her because he thought it wasn’t good for Mu Yufan to buy things for them, but when he saw his sister’s bright eyes, he couldn’t say anything to stop her.

“Okay! Actually, I also want to drink bubble tea! Let’s go, the three of us can go buy bubble tea!” Mu Yufan readily agreed and tried to accommodate and integrate them as much as possible because they were Leng Xiaoyao’s cousins.

Apart from that, he also felt sympathy for them and wanted to treat them better.

“Great!” Tang Ning danced in excitement and Tang Xing also agreed.

Mu Yufan asked them what flavor they wanted and bought one each.

Mu Yufan asked for their opinion on what to eat, but they didn’t say anything, so Mu Yufan decided to take them to a private home cuisine and ordered several dishes and soup.
