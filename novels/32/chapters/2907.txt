A dagger could remove soil and small stones.

Gano and Billy couldn’t make full use of it, but Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting could, because they didn’t rely on a tool to do the work.

Leng Shaoting picked up the hammer, then smashed it towards the rocks on the ground. As soon as he hit it, the rocks on the ground broke into pieces, but the hammer wasn’t damaged at all, which surprised Gano and Billy.

“Wow, this hammer is hard!” Billy said in amazement.

“It wasn’t damaged at all,” Gano said.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t explain and Gano and Billy didn’t ask about it either.

After that, they continued to dig holes.

Gu Ning used a dagger, but she was much quicker than Gano and Billy, which astonished them.

They admitted that Gu Ning was stronger than them, but they didn’t want to seem useless, so they used greater strength.

After twenty minutes, they were exhausted, so Gu Ning told them to have a rest.

When Gano and Billy regained some strength, they continued to work. They didn’t want Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning to think that they were lazy and wasted time. After all, they only did a little work.

In order to take the boxes out, they dug a large pit which was about a meter wide, so it took them a lot of time.

The four of them dug for about an hour before they finally touched the boxes.

The moment Gano and Billy saw the boxes, they were stunned. They weren’t sure whether it was the treasure they were looking for, but they believed that it was highly likely.

Normally, boxes wouldn’t be hidden under the ground.

Only Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting stayed calm.

Leng Shaoting didn’t see the boxes, but he knew there must be treasure since Gu Ning decided to dig a hole here.

Because Gano and Billy were too excited, they didn’t notice Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s reaction.

“Is this the treasure?” Billy asked excitedly.

“I think so,” Gano said.

“Let’s take it out,” Gu Ning said. Then Leng Shaoting jumped down and moved a box up.

“Can we open it?” Gano asked Gu Ning. He couldn’t wait to open it, but subconsciously asked for Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s opinions.

“Of course,” said Gu Ning. The box was locked, but it was already damaged after so many years, so it couldn’t be easier for them to open.

In this box, there was china from Country Hua and other countries.

Seeing that, Gano and Billy were finally sure that this was really the treasure.

“We’re so lucky! We found it so fast,” Gano exclaimed.

They were lucky? Of course not! It was Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s abilities, but Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t bother to tell them the truth.

“Is it worth a lot of money?” Billy asked. He barely knew anything about it.

“No idea, but what’s the use of this?” Gano asked. He was slightly disappointed.

“We’ll know soon!” Gu Ning said. Because they didn’t know anything about china, she didn’t talk to them about it.

Afterwards, Leng Shaoting moved the other boxes up, and they opened them.

One was full of jewelry and jewels, which was obviously valuable. Gano and Billy were excited in an instant.

“Jesus, there is so much jewelry and jewels!”

“And they’re very large. This box must be extremely valuable,” Gano and Billy exclaimed.

As more and more boxes were brought up, Gano and Billy were shocked again and again.

After all eight boxes were opened, they could see that three were already rotten, so they dumped them to the side. They would only share the good ones.

“How should we share it?” Gano asked. Now they were going to share the treasure, so he was very nervous. He wasn’t sure whether Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting would agree to share fifty-fifty.

After all, he hardly knew them, and it was undeniable that Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting did most of the work.

“Well, you can take a piece first, then we’ll take a piece. Whether it’s valuable or not, it’s up to our luck. In that case, none of us will suffer a big loss,” Gu Ning said.

“Great!” They agreed with Gu Ning happily.

They didn’t have the thought of sharing the value of the treasure exactly. Sometimes, the same piece could be sold at different prices.

If they picked by turns, they could have basically the same value of treasure.

In addition, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting used the most effort to find the treasure. Even if Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting wanted to take 60% of the treasure, they would accept it.

After that, they began to share the treasure.

At first, they took everything out of the boxes, which left the boxes empty.

They shared the jewels first. Because Gano and Billy weren’t familiar with their value, the pieces they picked were worth less than Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s, but there wasn’t a big difference.

When they turned to china, Gano and Billy decided to give all the china to Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

They liked china, but felt Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting ought to have more given what they had done during this adventure.

Gu Ning happily took it, because this box of china was worth no less than those jewels.

In the end, Gano and Billy had two boxes, while Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting had three, including jewels, diamonds, gold and silver.

Because they were very heavy, Gano and Billy couldn’t move it. Gu Ning helped them with one box, and they carried the other.

Gano and Billy were very grateful to Gu Ning for her help.

They had seen how strong Gu Ning was, so they weren’t afraid that she would be burdened.

Leng Shaoting carried the other three boxes alone. In fact, Gu Ning secretly put away a lot of the treasure into her telepathic eye space when they picked them, so what was left in the boxes wasn’t heavy. Moreover, the three boxes were easy for Leng Shaoting to carry.

With the boxes, they left.

When they returned to the entrance at the bottom of the sea, Gu Ning took out waterproof bags to wrap all the boxes to prevent them from being damaged by the water.
