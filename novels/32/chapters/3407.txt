3408 Till Your Resentment Dissipates

Wang Bing’s sudden change left everyone stunned.

Several police officers came back to their senses and immediately followed Wang Bing upstairs.

Once Cheng Qi realized that they were doomed, all he could think of was to escape.

Thinking about that, he acted, but he hadn’t run a few steps before being kicked back to where he started by Leng Xiaoyao and fell down.

After Leng Xiaoyao had everything ready, she came down and continued to watch.

Although Wang Bing was going upstairs to investigate, it was too late.

Punishment awaited him.

She had heard the phone call Cheng Qi received just then. Since someone was going to attack Cheng Qi, she temporarily wouldn’t get involved.

Soon, Yu Qin’s father also found out.

Although he married another wife, he also loved his daughter from his first marriage very much. So when he learned about it, he didn’t have any thoughts of letting Yu Xue go, no matter how much Yu Xue’s mother begged him.

Even if he wanted to let her go, the law wouldn’t. The death penalty was unavoidable.

The funeral parlor’s car arrived, but the deceased couldn’t be taken away for the time being.

Before long, another group of police officers arrived and directly controlled Wang Bing.

Although there was no evidence proving Wang Bing’s collusion with Cheng Qi, Wang Bing’s unprofessional attitude almost allowed the criminal to escape, so he was temporarily considered derelict in his duty.

Wang Bing was very worried that Cheng Qi would confess his involvement. If it was just dereliction of duty, the worst that could happen was being fired.

Although he didn’t want to be fired, it was better than becoming an accomplice and going to jail.

If he became an accomplice, he would be sentenced to ten years in prison, whereas Cheng Qi and Yu Xue, who were the murderers, would definitely be sentenced to death.

There was already video evidence, so there was no need to investigate Cheng Qi and Yu Xue’s case. What needed to be investigated was who sent this post. If it couldn’t be found out, it wouldn’t be too deeply investigated.

In the end, Cheng Qi and Yu Xue were taken away. They still couldn’t figure out who did it.

Before Cheng Qi and Yu Xue were sentenced, Yu Qin’s resentment couldn’t disappear, but after seeing Cheng Qi and Yu Xue being taken away, Yu Qin’s anger wasn’t as strong as before.

Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao took Yu Qin with her. Within seven days, Yu Qin had to enter the cycle of reincarnation, otherwise, she would become a wild ghost and wouldn’t be able to reincarnate.

However, they had committed a serious crime, so they should be executed soon.

“A cultivator,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

As a new ghost, Yu Qin didn’t know what cultivation was. “A cultivator? How do you cultivate?”

“Have you seen fantasy dramas?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“I have seen some. I like to watch fantasy dramas the most.” Yu Qin mentioned some fantasy dramas she had watched.

“My cultivation is to cultivate immortality,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Upon hearing that, Yu Qin was surprised. It turned out that cultivation really existed in the world!

Anyway, thinking about becoming a ghost herself, Yu Qin didn’t find anything unbelievable anymore.

“You should leave with us for now. Within seven days, you need to enter reincarnation. If you can’t enter reincarnation after seven days, it’ll be difficult for you to try again. You can only be a wild ghost if you miss the chance. The world of ghosts is worse than the world of mortals. At least, people don’t kill each other easily, but ghosts basically kill ghosts. There will be high-level ghosts who will absorb your soul to enhance their own abilities. Once your soul is eaten, you’ll never be reborn. These ghosts listen to me now, so they didn’t attack you, but I can’t stop other ghosts from doing that.”

“How can I enter the cycle of reincarnation?” Yuan Qin asked. She didn’t want to become a wild ghost to be absorbed by other ghosts.

“Wait for your resentment to disappear,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Yu Qin said unhappily, “As long as Cheng Qi and Yu Xue are sentenced, my resentment can dissipate.”

Leng Xiaoyao had already exposed the evidence for her. Not to mention that she believed Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t harm her, even if she did harm her, she accepted it.

…

After Cheng Qi and others were taken back, they still needed to go through another interrogation. The police were mainly going to investigate what role Wang Bing played in this case.

Cheng Qi knew that he was doomed, but even if he would be sentenced to death, he was determined to drag someone down with him. Therefore, he directly confessed that Wang Bing had been bribed by him with a hundred thousand yuan to handle this case simply.

Although Wang Bing initially disagreed, Cheng Qi had something on him.

Their relationship was very good, so they knew some dirty secrets about each other.

Half a year ago, Wang Bing raped a girl and was caught by Cheng Qi.

At first Wang Bing denied it, but eventually he couldn’t withstand the pressure and admitted.

Wang Bing wouldn’t be sentenced to death, but it was basically life imprisonment.

…

Regarding the press conference, Leng Xiaoyao sent invitation letters to several people, including Lu Ke, An Chenjun, and Ling Tianqi.

Luckily they all had free time, so they came the day before the press conference, along with Leng Yecheng.

Even Li Mochen also rushed back.

On Friday afternoon, Leng Xiaoyao arranged dinner and accommodations for them.

Because Leng Xiaoyao was a girl, it wasn’t appropriate for Leng Yecheng to stay with her at Hanlin Manor. So they all stayed at a hotel where they could chat with Ling Tianqi and the others.

However, Shen Xiyin, who also came, followed Leng Xiaoyao back to Hanlin Manor.

As a jewelry designer in the game, Who’s the Ruler, she was also going to give a speech at the press conference. This was the best opportunity for her to become famous.

As long as she appeared at the press conference tomorrow and the game became popular, many people would remember her. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Before that, Leng Xiaoyao had already helped her register on Weibo with the identity of a jewelry designer for Who’s the Ruler.

The press conference of Who’s the Ruler was held at a five-star hotel at 10 am on Saturday.

Originally, Mu Beihan and the others wanted to go, but unfortunately, the instructor didn’t allow them to leave. They couldn’t do anything about it.

Thanks to Xiao Yuming’s fame, Leng Xiaoyao invited many big-name media reporters.

Those who weren’t invited also came, but they could only stay outside and couldn’t enter the conference hall.

Today, Leng Xiaoyao appeared at the press conference as the boss of Xiaoyao Technology. Dressed in a stunning red cheongsam she impressed all the guests.

Everyone was shocked to learn that the boss of Xiaoyao Technology was such a young woman.
