“Great, I just don’t want Lihui to get hurt,” Yao Guanghui said, but felt quite disgusted.

“Dad, don’t worry. I promise that I won’t do anything that hurts Lihui,” Gong Zhengyang said.

Gong Zhengyang cared about his revenge the most, and couldn’t care less about women. Let alone having sexual relationships with other women, he wasn’t interested in any women even if they came on to him. It was tiring enough for him to deal with Yao Lihui, and he thought that it was totally a waste of his time. However, it wouldn’t be helpful to his revenge if he didn’t have a good relationship with Yao Lihui.

No pain, no gain.

In order to take revenge, he slept with his sister, but it was impossible for him to have kids, because he was reluctant to accept kids with his own sister.

“What did you want to talk to me about?” Yao Guanghui asked.

After that, Gong Zhengyang discussed his work with Yao Guanghui.

Tang Yunfan and the others stayed in Huafu Hills for a long while before they went back to the Tang family’s house. Gu Man also left with them for lunch, while Tang Yunfan would go back to work this afternoon.

It was the opening day of Xiangyun Antique-store today, so Gu Ning had to go to the antique street. She asked Tang Haifeng whether he wanted to leave with her. Tang Haifeng agreed with alacrity. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Tang Haifeng had been an antique lover for years, and he was also Gu Ning’s grandfather. There was no reason for him to reject it.

“I’ll go with you!” Cao Wenxin stood up at once.

“Me too!” Tang Jiakai said.

“Why don’t we go there together?” Tang Yunfan said. Although he wasn’t interested in antiques, he would love to attend the opening ceremony of his daughter’s shop. He had been absent when Jade Beauty Jewelry held the opening ceremony and release conference last time, and he didn’t want to miss this chance.

However, Gu Ning rejected his advice. “No, please don’t attract too much unnecessary attention for my shop.”

They were the richest man, the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and the Director of the Political Department in City B. It was hard for others not to pay special attention to them.

Tang Yunfan was struck dumb for a second, and felt aggrieved. “You don’t want me to show up?”

“Nope. Please take your fiancée to dine at your home now! I can go there with grandpa,” Gu Ning said.

Tang Yunfan didn’t insist, but he would still send her a gift under the name of the Tanghuang Group.

Afterwards, Tang Yunfan and the other adults went back to the Tang family’s house together, while Tang Haifeng, Cao Wenxin, Tang Jiakai, and Tang Jiayang followed Gu Ning to the antique store.

Gu Man wasn’t in a dangerous situation anymore, so Qiao Ya went back to Gu Ning’s side.

Cao Wenxin, Gu Ning and Tang Haifeng sat in the same car. Qiao Ya drove Gu Ning’s white Lamborghini, and the brothers shared a car.

The Tang family kept a low profile, so their cars were less noticeable although they were also luxurious cars. The most noticeable car had to be Gu Ning’s Lamborghini. It was her only car anyway.

On the way, Tang Haifeng called his old friends to appreciate the antiques with him. He also invited Master Lei and Zhao Yiru.

Zhao Yiru lived in another city, but his daughter married in City B, so he visited and stayed in City B often. He was retired after all, and had a lot of free time.

Hearing that Gu Ning opened an antique store in City B, both of the old men were surprised, because there were only a few young people who had an interest in antiques nowadays. They were also excited to appreciate antiques, especially when they knew that it was Gu Ning’s shop.

Tang Haifeng also called many other friends in the Antiques Association, Master Xiao was included.

“Hey, Xiao, what are you doing now?” Tang Haifeng asked with a broad smile on his face.

“On my way to the antique street. Do you have any good news?” Master Xiao asked. They seldom contacted each other, and talked about antiques every time they met.

“Great! I’m on my way to the antique street now as well. My granddaughter’s antique store is going to open today. Why don’t you go there with me? There are many good real antiques!” Tang Haifeng said with pride. Gu Ning who stood next to him, on the other hand, felt a little embarrassed, because Master Xiao had already seen them.

Gu Ning recognized Master Xiao’s voice, and felt surprised that Master Xiao was her grandfather’s friend.

Hearing that, Master Xiao was also surprised.

How come there are two antique stores going to open today? Tang Haifeng’s granddaughter is also in her early twenties. Why is the younger generation beginning to love antiques all of a sudden?

Master Xiao believed that Tang Haifeng’s granddaughter had to be Cao Wenxin, because Cao Wenxin was the only granddaughter in the Tang family till now.

“Sure, see you then.” Master Xiao agreed.

...

Xiangyun Antique-store was going to open at 10 am today.

Li Fengxia and Du Mingda focused on it the entire time. They were mad to see Du Laifeng and his shop, but they could do nothing about it.

When it was already 9:30 am, there were still only a few customers in the shop, so they gloated over Du Laifeng’s failure.

The signboard of Xiangyun Antique-store was still covered with a cloth, and others didn’t know that this shop was a branch of Xiangyun Antique-store, otherwise it would be crowded already. Xiangyun Antique-store was a famous brand in the antique industry now.

A while later, Gu Ning and the others arrived.

Once Tang Haifeng showed up, someone recognized him.

“Jesus, isn’t he Master Tang from the richest family in City B?”

“I think so! Wow, I didn’t expect that I could meet Master Tang here. I feel so honored now.”

Hearing their talk, more and more people gathered there with excitement. Master Tang held great fame in City B, and nobody didn’t know that his family was the most influential family in City B.

Li Fengxia and Du Mingda were also shocked. They couldn’t believe that Master Tang would visit Du Laifeng’s shop.

“And the girl by Master Tang’s side. Isn’t she the Goddess Gu, who is quite popular on the Internet these days? She’s also the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry.”
