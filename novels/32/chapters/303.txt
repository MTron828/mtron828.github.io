Chapter 306 Why Is It Inconvenient?

“I usually stay in the capital for a short time, and this is where I live when I’m in the capital. This house is cleaned regularly, so we can live in it anytime,” Leng Shaoting said.

After that, Leng Shaoting held Gu Ning’s hand, walking into the house.

The lights were on, and Gu Ning took a glance around the house. Its decoration was simple as well as elegant, and didn’t show any hint of luxury, which matched Leng Shaoting’s character really well. Although the house was furnished with the simplest essentials, there was everything they needed in it.

“You can leave if you’re busy. I’ll be fine here.” Gu Ning knew that Leng Shaoting had to go back to the Leng Family’s house, so she didn’t want to waste his time.

Leng Shaoting hugged Gu Ning, pressing his head into her fragrant hair. Apparently, he didn’t want to leave. After a long while, he finally said, “Wait for me, and I’ll be right back.”

“Sure,” Gu Ning replied.

Then Leng Shaoting pressed a light kiss on Gu Ning’s forehead before he left.

The Leng Family’s house was a legacy from their ancestry and was built in the early 20th century. It had been rebuilt and repaired partially, but still kept the classic style. And all the members of Leng Family lived in the same large quadrangle.

In the living hall, Leng Shaoting’s second aunt, Jiang Shuyuan, was criticizing Leng Shaojia who had been fooling around for half a year after her graduation. However, Leng Shaojia didn’t care what her mother was talking about. She was watching TV while eating snacks by herself.

“Welcome home, Lord Leng!”

At this time, the housekeeper’s surprised voice sounded, which struck both Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia dumb for a second. Leng Shaoting is back? Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia were obviously displeased after hearing the news that Leng Shaoting was back.

Leng Shaoting was too outstanding among the young generation in the Leng Family, so he was likely to inherit the Leng Family’s properties, thus Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia were jealous of him. Because of Leng Shaoting, Jiang Shuyuan’s son, Leng Shaomin, could lose the chance to inherit the Leng Family properties.

Although Leng Shaoting was the oldest grandson of Master Leng and it was quite reasonable that he was Master Leng’s successor, the other members in the Leng Family held opposite opinions because his parents had passed away a long time ago.

However, none of the members in the Leng Family was clear about Leng Shaoting’s ability and influence, even Master Leng knew no more than the others in their family. Only Master Leng was aware that Leng Shaoting had some properties under his name. The other people in the Leng Family just knew that he was a major general in the army. Even so, Leng Shaoting was the youngest major general in history at only 25-year-old, which was enough to prove his outstanding ability.

Leng Shaoting had told Gu Ning earlier that he only cared about his grandpa in the Leng Family, and the rest were all unimportant.

The housekeeper was named Leng Changzhi. He was a distant cousin of the Leng Family and then became Leng Weihua’s confidant, so he was also friendly to Leng Shaoting and Leng Shaoting respected him as well.

“Uncle Leng,” Leng Shaoting called him.

“Master is in the study,” Leng Changzhi smiled gently.

“Great, I’ll go meet him right now,” Leng Shaoting said, then walked inside directly.

“Hi, Shaoting.” Even though Jiang Shuyuan disliked Leng Shaoting, she still needed to pretend superficially.

“Nice to meet you, Aunt Jiang,” Leng Shaoting said coldly.

Leng Shaojia, on the other hand, ignored Leng Shaoting, but Leng Shaoting didn’t care at all. He walked straight upstairs.

In the study on the second floor, Master Leng was sitting behind a desk reading a newspaper. Hearing someone knocking on the door, he opened his mouth, “Come in.”

Leng Shaoting pushed the door open, walking inside.

Seeing Leng Shaoting, Master Leng immediately put the newspaper down and complained, “Why are you so late? I’ve been waiting for you!”

“I wanted to come even later, but I thought that I can leave earlier if I come earlier,” Leng Shaoting said on purpose.

Master Leng indeed turned angry. “What? You just arrived at the capital. Where are you going?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“My house,” Leng Shaoting answered.

“You scarcely came back. Couldn’t you stay here for a night?” Master Leng was apparently annoyed. He missed his eldest grandson so much, but it seemed like his eldest grandson didn’t care about his feelings at all. He was normally busy and it was understandable that he wouldn’t come home, but now since he was already home, why couldn’t he stay?

“It’s inconvenient.” Leng Shaoting preferred to stay alone with Gu Ning.

“Why is it inconvenient? This is your family’s place!” Master Leng almost lost his temper.

“I have a girlfriend.” Leng Shaoting didn’t hide the truth.

“What?” Hearing that, Master Leng rounded his eyes in shock, and couldn’t believe his ears. “What did you say? Say it again.”

“I have a girlfriend,” Leng Shaoting said with patience.

Master Leng abruptly stood up from his chair. He was too surprised to believe that it was real. “Really? Do you really have a girlfriend?”

“Yes.” Leng Shaoting gave his grandpa an affirmative nod.

Master Leng was more than thrilled now. His grandson finally had a girlfriend! Leng Shaoting was so handsome and charming, but never got close to any women. Master Leng had even doubted his grandson’s sexual orientation, which was later proved to not be true. However, no matter how Master Leng persuaded Leng Shaoting to date or have a girlfriend, Leng Shaoting would reject him without hesitation. Although Leng Shaoting was still young, and it was too early to get married now, Master Leng was worried that his grandson would probably be single and alone forever.

Master Leng didn’t care about family background. It would be better if Leng Shaoting fell in love with a girl who came from a family at the same level as his, but Master Leng would also support Leng Shaoting even if he chose a girl from an ordinary family in the end. Master Leng simply hoped for his grandson to be happy. Therefore, Master Leng didn’t ask Leng Shaoting about his girlfriend’s family background, because he trusted Leng Shaoting. “Where is your girlfriend from? When can you bring her to meet me?” Master Leng inquired anxiously.

“She comes from City F. She won’t see you until she finishes the National College Entrance Exam and goes to university in the capital.” Gu Ning had told him that she wasn’t mentally prepared yet, so she wasn’t willing to meet his grandfather now. Moreover, it was already against Gu Ning’s willingness that Leng Shaoting told his grandfather information about her.

“The National College Entrance Exam? How old is she?” Master Leng was shocked.
