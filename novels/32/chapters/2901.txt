2902 Is It a Trap?

“What is it?” said Gu Ning.

“I heard from my friend that Mrs. Leng rescued a girl when they were attacked by a giant python on the island that day. I want to know whether you’re really not afraid of pythons at all. Can you deal with it if you encounter one again?” Gano asked.

Gano asked that question because he needed them to solve a problem for him, otherwise he wouldn’t have especially paid them a visit.

“Yeah, I can deal with several, let alone one,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Gano was excited and asked at once. “How about other wild and dangerous animals?”

“I don’t think it’s a problem,” Gu Ning replied.

“Well, if so, can you work with me to do one thing, Mrs. Leng and Mr. Leng? It’s said that there is a deserted island a hundred kilometers away from the coast. There is a lot of treasure on this deserted island, but some ferocious beasts are guarding nearby. No one can get in or out of there safely. I’m not sure whether it’s true, because it has not been confirmed yet. I heard about it from my grandfather who had been there before, but he just went to the edge of the island and saw a lot of dead bodies on the beach, so he didn’t dare to go in. Besides, the island is surrounded by fog all year round. One needs good luck to land on the island. Mr. Leng and Mrs. Leng, if you are willing to cooperate with us, I’ll go back and ask my grandpa for the route. After we find the treasure, we can split it fifty-fifty. If you don’t want to do that, just forget it. After all, I can’t be sure that there will be treasure and if there isn’t our adventure will be meaningless,” Gano said.

It was just a proposal, he wouldn’t force them. Whether or not Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were interested was totally up to them.

Gano had only met Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting once, so it might not seem serious since he talked to them about it right away. After all, he barely knew them. There was no trust between them either.

However, compared with other people he knew, they were the best choice.

First, they could easily beat a giant python, so they were obviously very strong. Second, they weren’t local citizens, and they would leave after finishing it.

Adventures were always risky, so he needed to bet on that.

Anyway, he had a good impression of Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting and didn’t feel as if they seemed like backstabbers. Otherwise he wouldn’t be so honest with them.

If Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting dared to betray them, he wouldn’t hesitate to pay them back.

“Sure, we also love adventures. Whether there is treasure or not, we can go and have a look.” Gu Ning agreed without hesitation because they were anyway planning to have some fun. Therefore they were willing to pay a visit whether or not there was treasure.

However, if there was, it would obviously be better.

Given their abilities, they weren’t afraid that Gano would scheme against them.

If Gano regretted it after they found treasure, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting would take the treasure for themselves.

They wouldn’t betray him first, but they wouldn’t back down if Gano dared to do that to them.

Gano didn’t expect Gu Ning to agree so quickly, so he was surprised.

Gu Ning could see his reaction, so she didn’t urge him to give her a reply.

Before long, Gano came back to his senses, but he still wanted to make sure. “Mrs. Leng, do you agree?”

“Yes, we agree,” Gu Ning said in an affirmative tone.

Hearing that, Gano was satisfied. “Great! I’ll go back and ask my grandpa for a detailed map right now. If it’s possible, I hope we can set out at 8 pm. If we do it during the day, other people will see us.”

“No problem.” Gu Ning answered. Then Gano and his friend left, while Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting continued with what they were doing. After all, it was still early.

“Gano, why did they agree so fast? Is it a trap? I don’t have much trust in them. We’ve only met them once,” Gano’s friend said worriedly. He didn’t think there was much trust between them.

“Billy, I understand your worries, but I think they’re my best choice. We can’t find anyone who’s better than them,” Gano said. He also had worries, and was afraid that they might betray him after finding treasure, but it was unavoidable to take the risk if he wanted to get the treasure.

Since Gano said that, Billy said nothing further. He didn’t want to be so negative, and also hoped that there would be a good result.

…

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to the sea and dived deep to catch some seafood. They sailed for a round before coming back.

When they were back, it was time for dinner, so Gu Ning watched TV in the living room while Leng Shaoting went to cook.

She was like a queen, but Leng Shaoting felt that it was his honor to be able to serve her.

After filling their stomachs, they went for a walk outside. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Half an hour later, Gano and Billy arrived. There were only two of them, because they didn’t want other people to see them.

When Gano went home and asked his grandfather for the route, his grandfather turned him down at first, because it was too dangerous. He didn’t want his beloved grandson to face such a dangerous adventure.

Gano spent a long time persuading his grandfather before his grandfather agreed. Honestly, his grandfather didn’t think they would find the island.

There was no need for the four of them to go with two yachts. One yacht was enough, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went on Gano’s yacht.

Although Gano had the map, it wasn’t very useful. After all, they were sailing on the ocean instead of driving on the road.

There was water in every direction, so they had to reach their destination by guessing.

As a result, although the yacht moved fast, they spent two hours on the way.

In addition, they relied on Gu Ning’s guidance to arrive at their destination, because Gu Ning had a pair of Jade Eyes which could see much farther than a telescope.
