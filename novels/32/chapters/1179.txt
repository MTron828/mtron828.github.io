Chapter 1180 We Shouldn“t Have Doubted You

They had heard a lot about Gu Ning, so they all admired her. Nearly half of them were Gu Ning’s fans.“Hi, nice to meet you, I’m Gu Ning.” Gu Ning greeted them.

“Nice to meet you too, Miss Gu.” They all smiled happily.

However, they were only aware that Gu Ning was a successful businesswoman, and they didn’t know that Gu Ning was able to cure people too.

They thought that Gu Ning simply came with Tang Jiakai to visit his friend.

“Well, I need to tell you something. My sister can help Xiaoyu, and allow Xiaoyu to have a full recovery within several days,” Tang Jiakai said.

“What?”

They were surprised, and couldn’t believe it.

The doctor said that it would take at least half a month for Teng Xiaoyu to leave the hospital, but Gu Ning could help him do that within a few days?

They admitted that Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl, but they couldn’t believe that she could cure people.

“Jiakai, you must be joking!” a person said.

“I’m not. Ningning cured my grandfather’s heart disease before,” Tang Jiakai said.

Hearing that, everyone was shocked again.

Heart disease was very difficult to cure, but Gu Ning had cured Master Tang of it.

They turned to look at Gu Ning again in surprise. However, because it was beyond belief, they still had doubts.

“I understand that it sounds unbelievable, but I can treat you right now if you’re willing to accept my treatment. My medicine is very special and rare. There are countless people who want to buy it at a high price,” Gu Ning said to Teng Xiaoyu.

She agreed to cure Teng Xiaoyu, but she wouldn’t force Teng Xiaoyu to accept her treatment.

“I trust you, and I’m willing to accept your treatment,” Teng Xiaoyu said at once. As long as there was a chance that he could recover, he would have a try.

Since Teng Xiaoyu agreed, other people said nothing.

Gu Ning then took off her backpack and handed two porcelain bottles to Teng Xiaoyu. “Take a pill three times a day, and apply the liquid to your injury every day. I promise that you can leave this bed tomorrow and go back to normal after three days.”

If Teng Xiaoyu took and applied the medicine at the same time, he could recover sooner.

The others in the room were astonished. Even Tang Jiakai, who knew that Gu Ning was very incredible, was shocked.

Teng Xiaoyu took a power crystal without delay, and he felt cold and comfortable. After that, he applied some liquid medicine to the injury on his knee. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

One of his teammates wanted to clean the wound for him, but was stopped by Gu Ning. There was no need for Teng Xiaoyu to clean the wound at all.

The second the liquid touched his injury, he felt like something was different and rounded his eyes in shock.

“Wow, I can’t...” He didn’t know what to say all of a sudden.

“How do you feel?”

“How is it?”

Teng Xiaoyu’s friends asked him in a hurry. Teng Xiaoyu did his best to calm himself down and said, “I-I feel my injury is a little itchy and cold. It isn’t as painful as before either.”

“Really?” His teammates were greatly surprised and excited.

“Miss Gu, thank you, thank you so much!” Teng Xiaoyu thanked Gu Ning. He believed that he could make a full recovery within several days just as Gu Ning just told him.

“You’re welcome,” Gu Ning said.

“I told you that Ningning is unbelievable and that she can cure Xiaoyu!” Tang Jiakai said.

He was actually a little displeased when his friends doubted Gu Ning.

The others understood that Tang Jiakai was slightly annoyed by their attitude just then, so they felt embarrassed.

One of them apologized to Gu Ning without hesitation, “Miss Gu, I’m sorry. We shouldn’t have doubted you.”

“Please accept our apologies,” the others said at the same time.

It was understandable that they doubted Gu Ning before they knew her ability of curing people, but they still thought that they should apologize to her.

“You don’t need to apologize to me. I understand your worries seeing as we aren’t familiar with each other. I don’t mind it at all,” Gu Ning said.

Her kindness left a better impression on them.

They hadn’t met Gu Ning before, but now they found that she was very easy-going. In addition, she didn’t act or pretend in front of them.

Although they had just spent a short time with Gu Ning, they felt like Gu Ning was tolerant and gentle.
