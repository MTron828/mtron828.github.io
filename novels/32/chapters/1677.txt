Chapter 1680: Leng Yuanhan’s Manor

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Well, if so, I think we must visit Leng Shaoting’s father’s grave to help you remember something about him,” said Gu Ning.

“Please help me ask Shaoting where his father was buried,” said Jing Yunyao.

“As a senior officer of our country, I think his father must be buried in the National Graveyard. Normally, people are not allowed to enter it, but I can solve this problem,” said Gu Ning. “Mother, actually I think you should consider seeing Shaoting now. Shaoting probably knows more about your past, and he might greatly help you get your memories back.”

Hearing that, Jing Yunyao fell into silence.

As Gu Ning just said, Leng Shaoting indeed knew her past better than anyone else. In addition, she also ached to see her only child.

“I’ll think about it,” said Jing Yunyao.

“Great.” Gu Ning nodded.

“Why don’t we go to visit his father’s grave tonight? Nobody will see us in the night,” said Gu Ning.

Gu Ning planned to sneak into the graveyard.

“Sure.” Jing Yunyao agreed.

Because Peng Shiyin’s grave was far from Leng Yuanhan’s manor, they spent nearly an hour on the road.

When they finally arrived at the eastern district, it was almost 12 pm, so they went to dine first.

During the meal, Gu Ning received Xiang Honghuai’s call.

“Hey, did you buy the land? How about the male ghost?” asked Xiang Honghuai.

“Yeah, and it’s already done,” said Gu Ning.

“Wonderful. Who helped you get rid of the male ghost?” asked Xiang Honghuai with curiosity.

“A man I met before, and he promised me that the male ghost won’t come back again.” Gu Ning made up a lie.

“Very good.” Xiang Honghuai relaxed, then asked, “Oh, can you give me the man’s number? I want to learn from him.”

“Sorry, I don’t have his number. He’s a little strange and left right after finishing his job,” said Gu Ning.

“Fine.” Xiang Honghuai didn’t insist.

When Gu Ning finished the call with Xiang Honghuai, Jing Yunyao asked, “What male ghost?”

Jing Yunyao was surprised that Gu Ning had run into a male ghost before.

“Well, there was an ancient grave buried in a piece of land which I planned to buy a while ago,” said Gu Ning. They were in a private room now, so no one else would hear their conversation.

“Can you see ghosts?” Jing Yunyao was shocked.

“Yes,” said Gu Ning, but didn’t tell Jing Yunyao why she was able to see ghosts.

After having the meal, Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao went to the manor.

Gu Ning only knew its vague position, so she needed to search for it on the way. Luckily, she soon found it because there was a large area of green plants around it.

It was a private manor, so outsiders were forbidden to enter it.

The manor was rectangular, surrounded by a two-meter-high wall, and there was a circle of cypress trees inside the walls, which actually were even taller than the walls, so people couldn’t see anything from the outside. Moreover, the surrounding constructions were totally different now, and Jing Yunyao didn’t feel familiar with them.

Gu Ning decided to climb over the wall to get inside.

When they were at the top of a wall, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes. She scanned the inside of the manor for a while. As Peng Yunlong told her, there were mountains, water, a sea of flowers in the front yard, an ancient siheyuan in the middle, and a peach forest was hidden behind the mountains.

Although it wasn’t the peach blossom period and there was no peach blossom, the scenery of this manor was already beautiful enough.

Gu Ning could see the beautiful view with her Jade Eyes, but Jing Yunyao could only see a little in her sight.

There were only four people in the manor. Two middle-aged men and two middle-aged women, and they were managing this manor.

At this time, all of them were trimming and organizing flowers and plants in the front yard. The big house and the backyard were empty.

Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao jumped from the wall and walked inside.

They directly went to the backyard and didn’t bother to avoid the surveillance cameras.

As long as nothing terrible happened, no one would spend time watching surveillance videos. And even if someone did, Leng Shaoting wouldn’t blame them when he found out that the strangers who sneaked into the manor were Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao.
