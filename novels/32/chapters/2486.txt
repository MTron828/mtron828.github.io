Chapter 2487 Do It in Your Way

Hearing that, Jing Yunyao turned to look at Du Zhenghan, then coldly said, “I know why you want to see me. You just think an outsider shouldn’t be involved. It’s not allowed according to the rules. You want to punish me and Shaoting, right? But can’t you think about the situation?”

“We had a strong enemy. Shouldn’t we focus on defeating it first? It’s not important who can solve the problem. It’s a special situation, so we had to deal with it differently. We couldn’t stick to the rules and not care about the situation. They could easily have been killed without any help. Soldiers need to listen to orders, but they must be smart too. They shouldn’t sacrifice in such a stupid way!”

“If the task was delivered to you, would any one of you stand out to deal with it? You should know that the target was zombies, not humans. Before we arrived, special forces were sent in, but they made no progress.”

“I’m not saying that they’re useless. After all, it’s really hard for ordinary people to deal with zombies. I’ve been through the same thing before, so I know how to handle it. Nobody’s willing to die for nothing. There is nothing wrong with them turning to me for help.”

Jing Yunyao wasn’t polite towards them at all. She wasn’t in awe of them just because of their status or because she had the support from the Leng family and Wei Lingfeng. It was just her character.

Besides, they came for nothing good, so she didn’t need to be polite to them.

Hearing Jing Yunyao’s argument, they had no idea what to say. It was true that the enemy was too strong this time. They had to solve the problem first. As long as the problem could be solved, it didn’t matter who did it or whether it broke the rules.

The targets were zombies this time. Zombies were incredibly scary. None of them could imagine it and they were scared to death when they had only heard of it, let alone having to deal with it in person.

Although they had a high position, not all of them were skilled, because their work was different.

Du Zhenghan and the others spent most of their time in the office, and their subordinates would do everything for them. They would only train once in a while. Therefore, they were not very skilled. They might be able to defeat ordinary people, but they would easily be beaten by a normal trained soldier.

As a result, it was impossible for them to deal with the zombies.

Although they still doubted whether zombies really existed because they had only heard of it, the people who called for help witnessed zombies. Therefore, it was possible that zombies really existed.

Wei Lingfeng was already aware of the existence of monsters and ghosts, so he wasn’t surprised when he heard the news. Leng Shaoting had solved many problems related to monsters and ghosts before that anyway.

Since they were silent, Jing Yunyao said nothing further. Instead, she turned to Wei Lingfeng and said, “President Wei, I should apologize for keeping it a secret that I’m still alive. It’s my fault, but I didn’t do it for an evil reason. What I said is also the truth. If you don’t believe it, you can conduct an investigation to make it clear. And I think it’s very reasonable that I joined the task this time. If I’ll be punished because of that, I can accept the punishment. If it happens again, I won’t be involved again, but if our country needs me, I still won’t hesitate to stand out.”

Jing Yunyao was loyal to their country, or she wouldn’t have joined the army and carried out many dangerous tasks with Leng Yuanhan. She had done a lot for their country.

Now Leng Shaoting chose the same career and she couldn’t see Leng Shaoting be in danger and do nothing. She was more than willing to work for their country.

Besides, as a cultivator, it was also her responsibility to get rid of monsters and ghosts. “Of course we need you.” Wei Lingfeng made it very clear. If Jing Yunyao was willing to help, she was always welcomed. After all, she had superpowers. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Recently, there was more and more news about monsters and ghosts. They needed people with superpowers to deal with those horrible creatures.

“Well, I’ll have a meeting with the military later. If it’s possible, you can regain your position as a major. Leng Shaoting will lead you,” said Wei Lingfeng. In that case, no one else would control Jing Yunyao and she could spend more time with her son.

“President Wei, don’t you think it’s not a good idea?” Du Zhenghan immediately disagreed.

“President Wei, I don’t want the position of major. I don’t want to join the army either. I’m unwilling to be restricted. Would you please just allow me to join the Red Flame in carrying out tasks? Or please allow me to help them if they need any help. I’ll do my best,” said Jing Yunyao.

Jing Yunyao didn’t want to join the army again, because she was afraid it would be difficult for her to leave afterwards. Hearing Jing Yunyao’s words, Du Zhenghan and the others were surprised. Why did she give up this good opportunity to empower the Leng family?

Anyway, they were relieved to hear that.

“If so, we’ll do it your way.” Wei Lingfeng respected Jing Yunyao’s decision. In fact, if Jing Yunyao really got her rank back, the Leng family would reach a higher position, which might cause unnecessary trouble.

Although the Leng family could handle it, it was better for them to keep a low profile at this

moment.

“What do you think?” Wei Lingfeng asked Du Zhenghan and the others.

Du Zhenghan and the others exchanged a glance. They felt that they couldn’t do anything about it now, but they were reluctant to give up right away.

“If you don’t believe Yunyao, you can conduct an investigation. I won’t interfere. If Yunyao did anything unacceptable, she’ll be punished. I won’t let her get away with it. However, if Yunyao did nothing wrong, no one should bring it up again in the future,” said Wei Lingfeng. He said that because he believed that they wouldn’t start an investigation. They would choose to trust Jing Yunyao.
