Chapter 1113 Punch Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin Heavily

“Relax, I won’t kill you, and I have the right to defend myself,” Gu Ning said. She didn’t look worried at all.

“You...” Qi Ziyue was struck dumb for a second. He didn’t know what to say now, and this “Tang Aining” clearly had absolute control of the situation.

It seemed that he was doomed today.

Thinking of that, Qi Ziyue kept trembling in fear and suddenly had a urinary incontinence. He flushed with embarrassment.

Other people couldn’t see it, but Gu Ning noticed it and felt disgusted. She put the gun down, and Qi Ziyue relaxed a little. He thought that Gu Ning would let him go.

However, Gu Ning kicked his knee with great force and he lost balance and knelt down before Gu Ning.

“You...” Qi Ziyue felt utterly humiliated now.

“Do you feel humiliated now? If so, that’s right. I humiliated you on purpose,” Gu Ning said in a very unkind tone.

Gu Ning aimed to humiliate him, and she enjoyed seeing him humiliated.

Qi Ziyue was full of hatred towards Gu Ning now, but he didn’t dare to fight back.

“I read the news, and I knew that the female body the police found in the sea near City B was Aining. You killed Aining, and I’ll take revenge for her.” Gu Ning didn’t bother to hide the truth now.

After her rebirth, she had stayed in City B for a long time, but she didn’t go to the sea again. It was meaningless for her to go there again, because it would only remind her of some terrible memories.

“You...” Qi Ziyue rounded his eyes in shock. He didn’t expect that this “Tang Aining” was aware of everything.

Tang Yaxin, at this moment, stopped moaning in pain, and she also looked at Gu Ning with surprise.

“Are you confused about the reason why I know it?” Gu Ning asked. “Do you believe in ghosts?”

Hearing that, Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin trembled in fear. They didn’t believe in ghosts, but still felt scared.

“Let me tell you why, because Aining’s ghost found me before, and it told me everything,” Gu Ning said with a mysterious smile.

Qi Ziyue and Tang Aining were frightened.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you today, but I’ll torture you over time. It won’t be interesting if you’re dead so soon,” Gu Ning coldly said, then beat Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin heavily to vent her anger.

Tang Yaxin cared about her appearance very much, so Gu Ning focused on slapping her face.

As for Qi Ziyue, Gu Ning deliberately kicked his crotch, so he couldn’t have an erection for the time being. Men hated it most when they couldn’t get an erection.

Gu Ning didn’t stop and kept on punching their vulnerable parts around their bodies.

She would only seriously injure them. She would make sure that they had to lie in bed for half a month to recover.

After a while, Gu Ning stopped. She walked out and kicked those bodyguards again on her way.

From the beginning to the end, Gu Ning didn’t pay attention to the woman on the bed, because she had done nothing harmful yet.

Gu Ning was in a good mood after punching them.

Once she was gone, Qi Ziyue shouted at the woman who was lying on the bed, “Call the ambulance!”

“And the police!” Tang Yaxin shouted too. She had never been humiliated like that before, and she promised to pay “Tang Aining” back.

“We can’t call the police!” Qi Ziyue snapped at Tang Yaxin. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

They couldn’t call the police, or their dirty trick would be exposed. Besides, it was obvious that “Tang Aining” wasn’t someone they could mess with. He didn’t dare take the risk.

“Why?” Tang Yaxin was mad.

Qi Ziyue was in great pain now, and he was in no mood to explain it further to Tang Yaxin, but it was too important to be ignored. “Do you want our dirty trick to be exposed? Do you want us to be caught?”

Tang Yaxin soon realized that it was a stupid idea, but she was reluctant to give up. “So do we have to swallow this humiliation?”

“Are you an idiot or something? She clearly knows who we are and she has control of the situation now. We should save some energy and leave this damn place right now!” Qi Ziyue was furious. He didn’t want to waste time arguing with Tang Yaxin again.

Tang Yaxin was also angry, and she turned aside and ignored Qi Ziyue again.

After remaining silent for a few minutes, Tang Yaxin had an idea.

“Why don’t we hire a professional killer to kill her?”

Qi Ziyue nodded. It wasn’t a bad idea.

Gu Ning went to remove her make-up in a washroom before she drove away.
