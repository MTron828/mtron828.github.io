Chapter 402 The Shen family

“What a coincidence! I’m flying to City B too, but I have to transfer to Germany then,” Allan said.

They talked for a little while longer and soon it was the departure time. Allan sat in the first class, while Gu Ning’s seat was in the economy class, so they separated once they were aboard.

Gu Ning didn’t see Li Zhenyu again, maybe because their flights weren’t the same.

Just a short time after the plane which Gu Ning stepped aboard took off, a military helicopter slowly landed at a private airport in the capital. After landing, four men got out of the helicopter one by one. They were Leng Shaoting, Chen Meng, Xu Jinchen and Xin Bei who ranked fifth in the Red Flame.

The moment they were out the helicopter, Leng Shaoting couldn’t wait to turn on his phone and make a call. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Chen Meng and the other teammates shook their heads resignedly. Without a doubt, Leng Shaoting had to be calling Gu Ning. It seemed that their boss was deeply in love with Gu Ning, but it was better than being single and alone forever.

Leng Shaoting indeed called Gu Ning, but her phone was powered off. Gu Ning had told Leng Shaoting that she would only turn her phone off in planes. Otherwise, there had to be no signal or the phone ran out of power.

Thus Leng Shaoting thought that Gu Ning had to be on a plane now. Where is she going? Leng Shaoting thought. City G?

Thinking that Gu Ning was flying to City G, Leng Shaoting was displeased. He was anxious to meet her, but unfortunately, he still had something else to deal with now.

Xin Bei rubbed his stomach and said, “Come on, let’s go dine together! I’m starving.”

“Let’s go. Jinchen will pay the bill,” Chen Meng said.

“Hey, stop exploiting me! Don’t forget to respect the old and cherish the young!” Xu Jinchen complained. However, it was no big deal for him to buy his teammates a meal. He just disliked that they treated him like an ATM.

“Well, we know that, but you need to respect us first, and then we’ll cherish you!” Xin Bei laid his arm on Xu Jinchen’s shoulder. They were very close and didn’t care about age.

“Leave me alone!” Xu Jinchen got rid of Xin Bei’s arm. “You’re just used to taking advantage of me.”

Saying that, they noticed that Leng Shaoting had suddenly stopped in front of them. “What’s wrong with boss?” Xu Jinchen asked.

“Oh, no, I feel something must be wrong,” Xin Bei said. “It seems boss’s call wasn’t answered.”

Chen Meng gave Xin Bei a glance of disdain. It was obvious that their boss’s call wasn’t answered. Xin Bei shrugged.

“Hey, go and ask whether boss is going to dine with us,” Xin Bei said to Xu Jinchen.

“Why me?” Xu Jinchen retorted. Leng Shaoting was displeased now, and the last thing he wanted to do was to annoy his boss.

At that time, Leng Shaoting abruptly turned around, which scared the men behind him. “I need to go back to the Leng family’s house, you can enjoy yourselves,” Leng Shaoting said. After that, Leng Shaoting left.

It was during the day, so only Master Leng was in the Leng family’s house.

Leng Changzhi was surprised to see Leng Shaoting coming home and welcomed him in excitement. Master Leng, on the other hand, criticized him the moment Leng Shaoting appeared. “Shaoting, why didn’t you tell me that your girlfriend was the girl who rescued Jiang’s grandson?”

“You already know now,” Leng Shaoting said. He didn’t think that it was necessary to tell his grandfather everything about Gu Ning. Most importantly, Gu Ning wouldn’t allow him to do so. Otherwise, he would tell the whole world that Gu Ning was his girl.

Master Leng didn’t know how to argue back, but he just felt unhappy that Leng Shaoting didn’t tell him in person.

“Oh, it’s very unusual that you come home right after you finished a task. What about your girlfriend?” Master Leng teased.

“I have something serious to deal with right now,” Leng Shaoting said.

“What?” Master Leng asked. Master Leng understood that it had to be something important that Leng Shaoting wanted to discuss with him since he came back home.

Master Leng and Leng Shaoting were alone in the study, so Leng Shaoting said it directly, “Grandpa, do you still remember Chen Qiuyin’s older cousin, Chen Jinpeng, who was killed in a car accident three years ago? We stalked a drug dealer group in Burma this time. Unexpectedly, the person who makes deals with the group is precisely Chen Jinpeng who changed his name to Long Tianhu! In order to not alert him, I didn’t meet Chen Jinpeng in person. And as the later investigation shows, Chen Jinpeng is a senior manager of the Kirin Gang. In that case, the car accident which happened three years ago was completely a plot, which helped Chen Jinpeng to cover his real identity. I don’t know whether Shen Yanfeng is aware of it. I’m still investigating him. However, if he knows, it proves that the Shen family is much more ambitious than we thought.”

They always knew that the Shen family was ambitious, but didn’t expect that they would be that ambitious and bold. In addition, the Shen family was close to the Leng family, so the Leng family hadn’t doubted their behavior, or conduct an investigation.

“What?” Hearing that, Master Leng was quite shocked and was then furious. The Shen family was also involved in politics. And government officials hated to be connected with gangs.

If a government official wasn’t close to and didn’t make deals with gangs, he would be safe. However, if a government official did illegal things with gangs, he was doomed in his political career and would be sentenced to jail.

Since the Shen family was a relative of the Leng family, Master Leng wouldn’t be happy to see them being involved with gangs. And he decided to take action after a clear investigation. If the Shen family hadn’t done any illegal things with gangs yet, Master Leng would remind them to stay away from them, which was the most he could do. However, if the Shen family was involved in crimes, Master Leng definitely wouldn’t defend them.

Master Leng disliked gangs a lot. If he found out that his grand daughter-in-law-to-be was friends with the leader of the Qing Gang, he would be astonished, but luckily, Gu Ning wasn’t involved in any crimes with the Qing Gang.
