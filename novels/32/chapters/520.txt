Chapter 522 Putting Dishes Into Leng Shaoting’s Bowl

Although they didn’t know its price it had to be more expensive than Jiang Xu’s Mercedes-Benz.

Leng Shaoting opened the car door for Gu Man and Gu Qing before he did it for Gu Ning. Gu Qing and Gu Man sat in the back seat, while Gu Ning sat in the front passenger’s seat.

“Ningning, where shall we go first?” Leng Shaoting looked to Gu Ning and asked.

Leng Shaoting’s loving glance made Gu Ning’s heart skip a beat. She was a little annoyed at herself because she was easily seduced by his simple look.

Gu Ning calmed herself down. “It’s too early now. Let’s have a rest in Clean Water Blue Sky first, and we can go to the Jade Beauty Jewelry store after lunch before we go to the factory.”

“No problem,” Leng Shaoting said then drove away from the airport.

On the way, Leng Shaoting didn’t say a word, because he didn’t know what to say.

When they arrived at Clean Water Blue Sky, they went to Gu Ning’s apartment together.

Once they were in the apartment, Leng Shaoting sat on the sofa quietly, watching TV, while Gu Ning was preparing tea for them.

“Shaoting, where are you from?” Gu Man asked. She wasn’t investigating his background, but was just chatting with him.

Even so, Leng Shaoting still took it seriously. “The Capital.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Do you work in City G?” Gu Qing asked, because Gu Ning told them that he was her friend not one of her staff.

“Nope, I work in the capital but I’m on vacation now, so I came to City G for a break,” Leng Shaoting said.

At that moment, Leng Shaoting was well-prepared to answer the following questions about him. However, both Gu Qing and Gu Man stopped asking, which confused Leng Shaoting. Why did they stop asking? Is it because they aren’t satisfied with my manners today?

Actually, it was all because they had no idea that he was Gu Ning’s boyfriend.

A few minutes later, Gu Ning poured cups of tea for them, and they were chatting while drinking the tea in the living room afterwards.

Leng Shaoting’s sight fell on Gu Ning once in a while. Luckily, Gu Qing and Gu Man didn’t pay much attention to it, so they didn’t find out that there was anything unusual between them.

Around 11 am, they went out to have lunch together. During the meal, Gu Man put some dishes into Leng Shaoting’s bowl and said gently, “Shaoting, don’t be shy. Since you’re Ningning’s friend we’re not strangers.”

Leng Shaoting was struck dumb for a second, and suddenly felt like crying, because Gu Man’s kind behavior made him think of his own mother.

“What’s wrong? You don’t like the dishes?” Seeing Leng Shaoting being silent for a few moments, Gu Man was a little nervous. She was afraid that she had done something wrong.

“No-no,” Leng Shaoting immediately explained, “I just remembered my mom. She used to put many dishes in my bowl too when I was a child. It’s been a long time and nobody has done that to me, so I felt very touched.”

Leng Shaoting didn’t know why he would say that aloud all of a sudden, even Gu Ning didn’t expect that he would say that on his own initiative. When they were together, Gu Ning never dared to ask him about his parents, because she knew that it was a painful memory for him. Although it had been over a decade Leng Shaoting still felt hurt. However, he felt relaxed after saying it aloud this time.

Hearing what Leng Shaoting had just said, both Gu Qing and Gu Man were surprised. They instantly realized that this young man must have lost his own mother a long time ago, so they had a deep sympathy for him.

In order not to bring his painful memory up, Gu Qing and Gu Man didn’t ask further.

“Well, it’s a good day when we can gather together here. Come on, let’s enjoy the dishes!” Gu Man kept putting all kinds of dishes into Leng Shaoting’s bowl to make up for his absent mother’s love. Even though it was probably very late, it was meaningful.

Leng Shaoting felt touched by Gu Man’s kind gesture so he did his best to eat as much as he could.

When they had almost finished the meal, Leng Shaoting used the excuse of needing to go to the washroom, but settled the bill without them knowing it.

When Gu Qing and Gu Man found out that Leng Shaoting had already paid the bill, they felt a little embarrassed. “You didn’t need to do that,” Gu Man said.

“It’s fine, Ningning is my friend and a meal is nothing,” Leng Shaoting said with sincerity.

Since the bill was already settled, Gu Qing and Gu Man didn’t say anything further. In addition, they approved of his way of socializing

After that, the group of them went to Jade Beauty Jewelry.

Gu Ning didn’t tell Zhou Zhenghong that she was going to check the flagship store beforehand, because he would make unnecessary arrangements if he knew that Gu Ning’s family would be there too. Therefore, Gu Ning didn’t call Zhou Zhenghong until they were on the way to the flagship store. However, Zhou Zhenghong was in the factory at that moment.

Gu Ning then told him that she would be visiting the flagship store first before she went to the factory, so Zhou Zhenghong directly waited for her in the factory.

The flagship store of Jade Beauty Jewelry was located on the first floor of a shopping mall. It was decorated luxuriously and people would know that it was a high-end jewelry store by a simple glance. Even Gu Qing and Gu Man hesitated to walk inside, although they knew that Gu Ning was the boss.

The jewelry in Jade Beauty Jewelry wasn’t very dense; instead it was sparsely placed, so that people could clearly see the appearance of each piece.

There were around 17 customers in the store along with many saleswomen, and they seemed very busy.

Once Gu Ning and the others walked inside, a saleswoman stepped forward and greeted her with great respect, “Miss Gu, it’s so nice to meet you!”

The staff in the store all found out about Gu Ning’s real identity a few days ago. And they all admired her because she was able to be so successful at such a young age.

“Hi! You don’t need to spend much time with us. I can take them on a walk around,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure,” the saleswoman said then walked

away.
