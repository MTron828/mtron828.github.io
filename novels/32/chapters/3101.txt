3102 Song Meiyu Passed out in Anger

Why? How could Leng Xiaoyao become so impressive?

She made twenty million yuan by buying stocks and cut out a piece of jade which was worth over twenty million yuan.

“When did you learn to do stone gambling?” Leng Changyuan asked Leng Xiaoyao, looking at her with excitement. His granddaughter was so unbelievable that he even thought it was a dream.

“I learned it recently, and cutting out jade is mainly up to one’s luck. I have good luck, so I was able to cut out jade,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She concluded it to be good luck, otherwise she didn’t know how to explain it.

It was true that cutting out jade mainly relied on a person’s luck, so they were impressed by Leng Xiaoyao’s good luck.

“Grandpa, this is for you. You can make whatever you want with it, but you better pay someone you trust to do it, otherwise you might lose a lot,” Leng Xiaoyao said as she handed the violet jade to Leng Changyuan.

“Um, this is indeed a hot potato! It’s too expensive. Why don’t you keep it for yourself?” Leng Changyuan didn’t take it, because it was too expensive. He would feel uneasy if he took it.

“The price isn’t important. This is my love. You can’t reject it. If you do that, I won’t talk to you in the future. After all, I was very happy when I cut out the jade. And I immediately came to give it to you. Isn’t my love more valuable than the jade?” Leng Xiaoyao asked, acting angry.

Even though Leng Changyuan knew Leng Xiaoyao was doing it on purpose, he still didn’t have the heart to hurt her, so he finally took it.

“How can you threaten me every time?” Leng Changyuan was amused and very touched. Only close relatives were willing to give such an expensive gift.

“If I don’t threaten you, you wouldn’t take it.” Leng Xiaoyao was satisfied and showed it on her face.

“Fine.” Leng Changyuan could do nothing about it.

“Is my gift also a piece of jade you cut out?” Leng Yecheng asked, feeling that it was highly likely.

“You’re right!” Leng Xiaoyao said, then took out another jade and handed it to Leng Yecheng. “This is also a piece of the confederate rose jade that I paid eight million yuan for. It’s worth at least twenty million yuan as well.”

They were already amazed by the piece of violet jade which was worth over twenty million yuan, but now there was another piece of extremely valuable jade.

Song Meiyu was more jealous than ever!

Why was Leng Xiaoyao so outstanding? Why? Why couldn’t Leng Yuqi be so impressive? In that case, they could easily make a fortune.

“Yaoyao, you’re amazing!”

Leng Yecheng took the jade and didn’t want to put it down. He was too surprised to say anything. He had to admit that Leng Xiaoyao was unbelievable and she was getting better and better. He wondered what else Leng Xiaoyao could do. Anyway, he believed Leng Xiaoyao must have a lot more skills he didn’t know about.

“Of course,” Leng Xiaoyao said proudly. She accepted their compliments without delay. After all, she was indeed impressive to them.

Afterwards, she raised her arm and showed them her blood jade bracelet. “See? I found it at a stand today. It cost me a thousand yuan, but it’s real, so it’s worth at least twenty million yuan!”

“What?”

Hearing that, everyone was surprised. They heard surprising news one after another today, so they couldn’t digest it immediately.

Song Meiyu was so jealous of Leng Xiaoyao that she passed out in anger.

Leng Changyuan immediately ordered a servant to call Leng Yehua and took Song Meiyu to the hospital.

Leng Yehua didn’t have time to ask why Song Meiyu fainted, but Leng Changyuan and the others clearly knew that she passed out, not because she was sick, but because she was angered by Leng Xiaoyao.

“Meiyu is too jealous. How could she faint like that?” Leng Changyuan complained.

“Yeah, she never treats Yaoyao well. Now Yaoyao has become outstanding, so she has lost her calm. She must wish her daughter was as impressive,” Leng Yecheng said. He had a bad impression of Song Meiyu.

Leng Xiaoyao shrugged. Although she didn’t mean to anger Song Meiyu when she took the jade out, she didn’t expect her to pass out so easily.

Anyway, she only fainted for a while and wasn’t sick, so Leng Xiaoyao didn’t feel guilty.

Halfway to the hospital, Song Meiyu woke up. Leng Yehua asked, “What happened? Why did you pass out all of a sudden?”

Song Meiyu didn’t answer, and instead started crying. She looked heart-broken.

“What happened? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?” Leng Yehua thought Song Meiyu was sick, so he asked with concern.

“Leng Xiaoyao, Leng Xiaoyao…” Song Meiyu said, but couldn’t finish a sentence.

“What did Leng Xiaoyao do? Did she anger you?” Leng Yehua frowned with displeasure. If that was the reason, he couldn’t forgive Leng Xiaoyao.

“Leng Xiaoyao made twenty million yuan from the stock market. And she paid 16 million yuan for two half-cut raw jade materials, then cut out two pieces of jade which are worth more than fifty million yuan. A-And she bought a blood jade bracelet which is worth over twenty million yuan by accident! How could she be so lucky!” Song Meiyu exclaimed. She was reluctant to accept the truth.

“What?” Leng Yehua was shocked, and so was the chauffeur. He almost lost control of the car.

“H-How is that possible?” Leng Yehua couldn’t believe it. Leng Xiaoyao was too unbelievable if that was true!

“Leng Xiaoyao just took out the jade and told us. I was there! I couldn’t accept it, so I passed out,” Song Meiyu said. She told her husband the reason why she fainted. She wasn’t afraid of making a joke out of herself.

She was incredibly angry, so she paid little attention to her image.

Song Meiyu was so mad that she passed out. In that case, Leng Yehua couldn’t blame Leng Xiaoyao for that, but Leng Xiaoyao was totally beyond their expectations, so he lost his calm as well.

…

In the Leng family’s mansion.

After staying with Leng Changyuan and the others for a while, Leng Xiaoyao said that she had an appointment with her friends and needed to go.

Leng Changyuan didn’t ask more or stop her.

Leng Xiaoyao had won his trust, so he wouldn’t restrict her freedom, but he still reminded her to be careful and to come home early.
