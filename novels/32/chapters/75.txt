Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Um, nothing,” the hotel manager denied. He tried to stay calm, but failed. The two men definitely didn’t believe him.

“Tell them we have a problem here,” one of the men said to the other. The other man then turned to walk out.

Gu Ning looked at the man’s gun. He hadn’t cocked it yet. If Gu Ning went to grab his gun, there was no chance for the man to shoot. In other words, it was safe for Gu Ning to do so.

Gu Ning gave the military officer a knowing look. The latter immediately understood.

The military officer was amazed too. This young girl wasn’t afraid at all! She even wanted to act first.

To be honest, the military officer didn’t trust Gu Ning’s ability. He was a little hesitant, but when he saw Gu Ning’s undeniable look, he immediately felt more confident.

Therefore, he nodded slightly as affirmation.

The girl dared to grab the gun directly from a man, which showed she had both courage and ability.

Gu Ning then started to act. She came to the man like lightning and grabbed his hand, with a snap sound, the man’s hand was broken.

Meanwhile, the military officer pulled his gun out, shooting at the other man.

Before the man could make a sound, Gu Ning immediately stuffed his mouth with tissues. She then raised her hand and slashed it toward his neck. The man immediately lost consciousness.

Because the officer’s gun was equipped with a silencer, it did not make any sound. He accurately shot the other man in the head. The man then silently fell onto the ground.

It all happened too fast to be noticed. The two men still didn’t realize what had happened before they were both killed.

Both the hotel manager and Zhou Zhenghong rounded their eyes in shock. They felt like they were in a dream.

The military officer instead was also surprised by Gu Ning. He didn’t expect this young girl could be that powerful. She was even as good and swift as he was.

He had been in the army for at least 10 years as a senior special commander, and had been through at least 10 years of devil training. What kind of training had this girl been through? The military officer thought to himself.

Although he wondered, he didn’t ask. It was none of his business after all.

Besides, he had a bigger fish to fry now.

“You all must leave now!” the military officer said.

“It’s too late,” Gu Ning said. She saw someone going out from the private room next door.

As soon as the man came out, he would find the bodies.

At that moment, Gu Ning ran out before she could say another word. The rest of the people in the room were all surprised. They had no idea what she was going to do.

Zhou Zhenghong wanted to have a look, because he was worried about Gu Ning’a safety. However he was stopped by the military officer. Instead, the military officer followed her.

Leng Shaoting, on the other side, noticed Gu Ning was coming out.

Seeing Gu Ning is out, they knew the people in private room No. 3 were fine now; but why was Gu Ning rushing out? Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Amid all the confusion, Gu Ning dashed to the door of private room No.4. At the same time, the door was pushed open and a man walked out.

Before the man noticed Gu Ning coming, Gu Ning hit him with great force. The man lost consciousness at short notice and fell onto the ground. Gu Ning then grabbed his gun.

Watching that, Leng Shaoting and his people who were staring at the screen, as well as the military officer who followed Gu Ning out were all shocked.

They now understood why Gu Ning said that it was too late.

But how could she know that there was a man coming out?

Knowing that Gu Ning was safe, Leng Shaoting was relieved. Now it was time for them to act.

Three of them walked out immediately.

Gu Ning’s gaze met Leng Shaoting’s eyes coincidentally. Seeing his handsome cold face, Gu Ning’s heart skipped a beat. But she knew it wasn’t the appropriate time to appreciate the handsome man.

“Get back to the private room,” Leng Shaoting said to Gu Ning.

“I can protect myself,” Gu Ning replied. She wouldn’t go back.

Leng Shaoting frowned a little. He was apparently dissatisfied but he didn’t say anything more. He was confident that as long as he was here, he could protect the young girl. Immediately after that, Leng Shaoting and his people ran into private room No.4. A round of gunshots followed.

Once the gunshots sounded, the whole building was lost in terror. People ran away, trying to hide. The building even shook a little.

Zhou Zhenghong and the hotel manager were scared and hid themselves directly under the table.

Zhou Zhenghong was very worried about Gu Ning, but he did not dare to go out. Moreover, he didn’t go out because of Gu Ning’s warning.

Before long, the gunshots stopped.

Meanwhile, the sirens also sounded downstairs, but the police were notified in advance and cleaned up the scene.

Although Gu Ning didn’t walk into the room, she knew clearly what was happening inside because she used her Jade Eyes.

Leng Shaoting only had three men with him, while the other party had seven or eight men. But for the suspect, the appearance of Leng Shaoting and his men was so unexpected. Thus when the other party reacted, it was already too late and they were all killed

And Leng Shaoting as well his men, were all safe.

They were amazingly powerful.

Although the mission was completed, Leng Shaoting and his men didn’t leave right away. They were waiting for the police so that they could hand over.

Gu Ning turned around to go into her private room. She told Zhou Zhenghong and the hotel manager it was alright now.

“Boss, are you alright?” Zhou Zhenghong heard Gu Ning’s voice. He immediately moved out from beneath the table, along with the hotel manager.

Seeing that, Gu Ning felt like laughing, but she had no intention to make fun of them.

It had been a gun war, and it was totally understandable that people got scared.

“I’m fine,” Gu Ning replied.

“Manager, I suppose you need to close the restaurant for a while because of what has just happened. We won’t bother you here,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure-sure. I’m so sorry about that, miss. Oh, thank you so much for rescuing me.” The manager didn’t forget that Gu Ning had saved his life.

“I was saving myself too,” Gu Ning said. She wasn’t being modest, she simply told the truth.

Then, Gu Ning together with Zhou Zhenghong, who hadn’t recovered from the shock yet, went outside.

“Please wait.”

Before they went far away, Leng Shaoting stopped them.

“Sir, what’s up?” Gu Ning turned around. She looked at Leng Shaoting walking to her with her big beautiful eyes. Her voice sounded charming. All the men were softened.

Leng Shaoting’s heart skipped a beat as well. This girl is so adorable!

But the feeling quickly went away.

Leng Shaoting came to Gu Ning, reaching out his hand. “Non-military or police personnel are not allowed to hold guns privately. Once found, it must be handled as illegal behavior.”

Everyone was shocked.

What? This young girl had a gun?
