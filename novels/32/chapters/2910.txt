2911 Chu Peihan Is Splashed with Sulfuric Acid

Most people didn’t know where Chu Peihan lived, but some malicious people followed her to find out.

That afternoon, Chu Peihan went to meet Gu Ning. However, when she walked into the parking lot, a man got out of a car next to hers and suddenly splashed a bottle of liquid in his hand at her face.

Because it happened abruptly, Chu Peihan barely avoided it even though she was agile. Luckily, she protected herself at once by covering her face with her arm, so the liquid was splashed against her arm and not her face.

She instantly felt a hot pain from her arm and she realized that it was probably sulfuric acid.

She was furious and fought back at once.

The burning pain in her arm didn’t affect her movements. She raised her foot and kicked the bottle out of the man’s hand. At the same time, she deliberately splashed some sulfuric acid onto the man’s body as well. Although it wasn’t as serious as what she had suffered, it caused him a lot of pain too.

The man was obviously weaker than Chu Peihan, so he screamed in pain.

The next moment, Chu Peihan kicked the man’s belly and he fell heavily to the ground.

Without delay, Chu Peihan stepped on his arm. With a clear sound, his arm was dislocated causing him to scream in pain again.

They soon attracted the security guards’ attention. When the security guards came over, they were shocked by the scene.

They recognized Chu Peihan, so they believed that it must be the man’s fault.

“Miss Chu, what happened? Can we help?” a security guard asked.

“This man splashed sulfuric acid over me. Please call the police for me, thanks!” Chu Peihan replied.

Hearing that, the two security guards were shocked. How could this man splash sulfuric acid on Chu Peihan!?

One security guard immediately took out his phone and called the police for Chu Peihan.

Chu Peihan, meanwhile, called Gu Ning.

She called Gu Ning instead of her boyfriend, because only Gu Ning could cure the wound on her arm.

Once Gu Ning heard about the situation, she rushed over.

Before she came, the police arrived. After knowing the situation, they took the man away.

Because Chu Peihan was a famous star now, she could not go to the police station even though she was the victim. The police understood that and didn’t take Chu Peihan away. They also promised to find out the truth as soon as possible.

Many people were aware of Chu Peihan’s background now. She was the girlfriend of the Han family’s heir, and a close friend of the chairman of the Shengning Organization. She had powerful connections, so the police had to take this case seriously.

Although Chu Peihan didn’t go to the police station, the police took a picture of her wound. They needed evidence to sentence the man.

Chu Peihan didn’t know why the man splashed sulfuric acid on her, but she guessed that he was either paid by someone else, or he was another actress’s crazy fan. After all, there was no grudge between her and this man, but this man wanted to ruin her.

It had happened before.

Chu Peihan had indeed had conflicts against several actresses. They hadn’t just argued or fought against each other, they also competed against one another.

Some competitions were public, but one actress believed that Chu Peihan stole her resources. She believed that she would get the role from the beginning, or she had gotten a promise from someone by selling herself, but she failed in the end. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

That was just Chu Peihan’s guess. Without solid proof, she wouldn’t say anything. She believed the police could help her find out the truth.

If the police couldn’t find out, she would turn to Gu Ning for help.

Although the wound must be dealt with right away, Gu Ning said that she would be fine, so Chu Peihan didn’t go anywhere. She stayed in the parking lot, waiting for Gu Ning to come over.

After Gu Ning came, she gave Chu Peihan a power crystal at once, then she applied magical power liquid to the wound. Within a short time, the wound faded a lot, but it wouldn’t heal until three days later, because the burn was serious.

Afterwards, Gu Ning gave the magical power liquid to Chu Peihan and told her to apply the liquid to her wound once a day.

Because Chu Peihan was injured, Gu Ning told her to rest at home. Chu Peihan didn’t need to join them for the meal. Gu Ning would pack up some food for her.

Chu Peihan, however, refused. “I’m fine now. There is no need to worry about me. It is just a meal, it shouldn’t be a problem. Anyway, you’re with me, right?”

Since Chu Peihan insisted, Gu Ning said nothing further. After all, Chu Peihan was fine now, and she could take care of her, but it was impossible for Chu Peihan to drive, so Gu Ning would drive instead.

“Did you tell Han Chenglin?” Gu Ning asked.

“No, he has job today. He’ll contact me after it’s done. He hasn’t called me yet, so he must be at work. I don’t think it’s necessary to tell him since you’re with me now. I don’t want to worry him,” Chu Peihan said. She was a considerate and strong girl, so she wouldn’t ask Han Chenglin to stop working and come to see her right now, but she wouldn’t be so strong in all situations.

She already had a boyfriend, so she could be spoiled sometimes.

If she was too considerate, her boyfriend might think that he didn’t need to take care of her and she would lose his attention and care.

“Fine!” Gu Ning nodded because she would do the same thing if it happened to her.

After all, everyone was so busy, and they had to learn to take care of themselves.

Luckily, even though Gu Ning could deal with everything on her own, Leng Shaoting still cared about her and loved her as usual. Honestly, he loved her more since she was strong and considerate.
