Chapter 1944: Do You Remember Ji Zijing?

Leng Shaoting told Gu Ning about his encounter with vampires on his last mission while they waited for Xu Jinchen and Zi Beiying.

Although Gu Ning believed they existed, she had never seen them before, so she could not help sounding surprised when she heard about them.

“What are vampires like?” asked Gu Ning. She wondered if they appeared just like the ones in movies!

“Vampires look no different from normal humans on the outside, but they resemble evil cultivators. They are just a different race. Their complexions are a lot fairer than normal people and they have an evil aura radiating from them,” said Leng Shaoting.

In that case, it sounded like they resembled the ones she had seen in movies.

“We have certainly encountered quite a number of evil creatures! Oh yes. I forgot to tell you about something. I met some Country R ninjas while I was in City B. They knew about the existence of cultivators and came to investigate the matter. Although they did not even know what they were looking for, they knew that those people were capable of magic and could fly around. They were clearly talking about cultivators,” said Gu Ning.

Leng Shaoting promptly looked stern. “The vampires I encountered while I was on mission also bumped into cultivators previously. They wanted to go back and tell their leader about it, so I had to kill them.”

Gu Ning immediately looked worried and serious. “From the looks of it, we won’t be able to keep the existence of cultivators under wraps for long. The news might even lead to war.”

Although it was hard for them to learn more about cultivators, it was unavoidable.

Even though they were in modern times and no one would wage war unless it was absolutely necessary, there was a lot of politics involved and all the countries wanted the best for themselves.

Since their country was developing well, a lot of the other countries could not stand by and watch, and secretly made moves on them. However, it did not work out as they anticipated.

Now that they had come to know about the existence of cultivators in their country, the other countries were bound to feel worried and the need to get rid of these threats.

“I have already told my superior about the vampires, but I may have to tell him about the existence of cultivators before it becomes public knowledge so that he is prepared. I hope you don’t mind,” said Leng Shaoting. Although he had the right to decide on his own, he learned about cultivators from Gu Ning, so he ought to discuss it with her as a sign of respect.

“Why would I mind? Considering the situation we are in, it is necessary to tell him. However, it would be better to keep it from the rest of the public. Otherwise, we will have a hard time cleaning up the mess if it causes any chaos,” said Gu Ning.

Leng Shaoting was relieved to hear her response.

…

Zi Beiying and Xu Jinchen showed up 30 minutes after Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

“Hi, Shaoting and Ning.”

The moment Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning showed up, Zi Beiying greeted them. Despite her carefree nature, she could not help feeling awkward since Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting knew about her interest in Xu Jinchen. Although they were not together officially, they had ambiguous feelings towards each other.

“Hi, Mr Leng and Miss Gu,” greeted Mengda and Nan courteously.

“Hi. Have a seat!” said Gu Ning as Zi Beiying sat next to Gu Ning with Xu Jinchen sitting right next to her. Mengda and Nan proceeded to sit next to Xu Jinchen.

“Ning, Shaoting, thank you. If not for you, I don’t know when my family would tide through the crisis!” Zi Beiying thanked Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning.

Her family would not have fallen due to the ambushes if Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning did not offer to help. After all, her family had a lot of history and wealth. However, they did help to prevent the Zi family from losing more deals.

Whatever it was, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning had done the Zi family a huge favor, so they were naturally grateful.

Zi Beiying handed a card to Gu Ning. “This is your reward.”

“Thanks! I won’t be shy about it.” Gu Ning took the card right away. Since they had agreed on rewarding her, Gu Ning did not hold back.

“You earned it,” replied Zi Beiying.

Before long, the food was served and everyone started dinner.

“Oh yes. Beiying, how long are you planning on staying here? If you plan on making this a long trip and don’t like staying at a hotel, you are welcome to stay at my place while you’re here if you don’t mind!” said Gu Ning. She knew that Zi Beiying was not going to leave so soon. And although Zi Beiying came with Xu Jinchen, they were not dating, so it did not seem appropriate for Xu Jinchen to host Zi Beiying.

Xu Jinchen felt the same way, so he did not interrupt when Gu Ning offered a room to Zi Beiying.

If Zi Beiying wanted to stay at a hotel, he could arrange for it and she could stay for as long as she liked at Jinlin Hotel. However, it was more comfortable to stay in a house.

He also owned several residential properties and Zi Beiying was welcome to pick any of them. It was simply inappropriate for her to stay at his place, so he left Gu Ning to it when she offered.

“Of course, I don’t mind. I’m just worried about inconveniencing you,” said Zi Beiying as she glanced at Leng Shaoting. She thought they were cohabiting, and she might get in their way if she moved in.

“It’s perfectly fine. I rarely go back to begin with and spend most of my time at school. Even if I don’t live on campus, I have other properties. Some of my friends just swing by occasionally on the weekends to hang out,” said Gu Ning.

“In that case, I won’t be shy.” Since Gu Ning was open to it, Zi Beiying did not turn down her offer.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were both loaded, so they must have multiple properties.

Halfway through dinner, someone knocked on the door. It was none other than Xu Jinlin.

“How did you know we are here?”

Leng Shaoting did not tell Xu Jinchen that Xu Jinlin was here, so Xu Jinchen was surprised to see him.

Zi Beiying could not help feeling anxious when she encountered Xu Jinlin. It felt as though she was meeting Xu Jinchen’s elder even though they were not dating.

“I bumped into Shaoting and Ning earlier. I invited them to join me for dinner, but Shaoting said he was eating with you and a friend. Since I had something to tell you, I came over after I was done with dinner,” said Xu Jinlin as he sat down beside Xu Jinchen.

“What is it?” asked Xu Jinchen.

“Do you remember Ji Zijing? She is the daughter of one of Mom’s friends. She has become a rather famous designer now and is tall and pretty. She has just returned home and plans on carving a career here. Mom wants you to see her and consider her as a marriage prospect,” said Xu Jinlin. Since he did not know about Zi Beiying and Xu Jinchen’s relationship, he spoke bluntly.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
