915 Dive into the Sea Again

Even Ye Jiasheng felt stressed when Leng Shaoting was mad. Leng Shaoting was born to be a man of power.

Afterwards, he ignored Ji Manlin and held Gu Ning’s hand while walking towards the door, followed by Gao Yi and Qiao Ya.

Seeing that, Ye Jiasheng followed them at once.

Ji Manlin didn’t get her mind back until they were all gone. She collapsed to the floor feeling scared.

Onlookers also began to criticize her.

“She’s so shameless!”

“How could she try to steal another girl’s boyfriend right in front of the girl?”

“She doesn’t have a clear understanding of herself. I think that the girl is much more beautiful than her.”

“I agree.”

“She has no sense of self-respect either.”

“The handsome young man didn’t bother to give her a glance!”

“I’m afraid that she has had sex with many men before because she’s so easy.”

“It’s so disgusting!”

...

Hearing people’s discussions, Ji Manlin was angry, but she had no energy to argue against them.

She still didn’t think that she had done anything wrong. She simply wanted to chase her love, which wasn’t her fault. It was hard to change a stubborn person’s opinions.

...

Gu Ning received Ye Chaoxiong’s call when they arrived at the wharf. Ye Chaoxiong invited her to visit City M again in the future if she was free.

Out of politeness, Gu Ning agreed, but it was up to her whether she would visit City M again.

Ye Jiasheng didn’t leave until they were all on the yacht arranged by the Ye family.

Once Ye Jiasheng got home, Ye Chaoxiong asked him, “How is it?”

Ye Jiasheng said, “She already has a boyfriend who is also her bodyguard. He’s taller, more handsome and more powerful than me. I don’t think he’s an ordinary man.”

Ye Chaoxiong had the intention to let Ye Jiasheng chase Gu Ning. She was so good at gambling. If she married into the Ye family, the Ye family would be more successful.

It wasn’t that they just want to make use of her, because they also had a good impression of “Tang Aining”. If she was willing to marry into the Ye family, they would treat her well without a doubt.

Ye Jiasheng was also impressed by Gu Ning, so he was willing to chase her. Unfortunately, she already had a boyfriend. Besides, her boyfriend was more attractive than him. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Chaoxiong was a little disappointed, but soon accepted it.

...

Half an hour later, Gu Ning and the others arrived back in HK. She told Gao Yi, Qiao Ya, and Leng Shaoting to go back to the hotel before her, because she needed to deal with something alone.

Although Leng Shaoting was worried about her safety, Gu Ning insisted on it, so he had to leave before her.

After that, Gu Ning went to rent a small yacht and sailed alone.

As a professional killer in her previous incarnation, she had to learn how to move by all modes of transportation.

Within 20 minutes, Gu Ning reached somewhere near the small island. She put on a wetsuit without an oxygen mask and other diving equipment because she didn’t need them.

Once Gu Ning dived into the sea, she put the yacht into her telepathic eye space.

Her telepathic eye space had now expanded to 40 square-meters or so, which was enough to accommodate a four meter long and two meter wide yacht.

Just like that, the yacht suddenly disappeared from the sea, while Gu Ning was already deep in the sea.

Those men who had been left behind on the island by Gu Ning were still there. Although they got free after getting rid of the ropes, nobody came to rescue them. They kept waiting by the beach, hoping to see a ship or something.

They got excited when a yacht approached, but it soon disappeared. They didn’t witness the scene where the yacht disappeared out of the blue, so they thought that it must have moved to another side of this island, but they still failed to find it.

Gu Ning swam to the passage in the sea without delay.

The waves moved violently by the reefs. If Gu Ning didn’t have her magical power to protect her, she would have been pushed back.

It still wasn’t easy for Gu Ning to get into the passage, because there were countless marine plants at the entrance.

Gu Ning removed those marine plants and disturbed a school of fish by accident. It was painful when those fish swam out together and hit her body.

When the school of fish was finally gone, Gu Ning swam inside.

This boat-way was blocked by the reef at the exit. After entering the undersea passage for about three meters, she passed the area that was sealed and came to the boat-way. It was time to leave the water.

However, the passage ahead was still long, cold and dark. Luckily, Gu Ning had her magical power to protect her body so she wasn’t affected.

When she was about to reach the exit, she felt something twist around her foot. She was scared and looked down at once. It turned out to be a sea snake, which disgusted Gu Ning. She released her magical power to freeze it without hesitation, in case it bit her.

Afterwards, she took out a dagger and moved it off.

Right at this moment, Gu Ning found many bones of the dead entangled by creatures under the sea.

They were probably the people who made this boat-way, or people who came here to search for treasure.

It was impossible for ordinary people to survive here.
