Chapter 2799: Leng Shaojia Apologizes

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

If Leng Shaojia apologized to her, she could accept it. If not, she wouldn’t care. Anyway, it wasn’t important.

In the end, Leng Shaojia finally summoned up her courage and opened her mouth. “Gu Ning, thank you, and sorry.”

Although her tone didn’t sound friendly, she sincerely made that apology. It was the first time that she had ever felt so guilty towards Gu Ning, so it wasn’t easy. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However, when she finally made that apology, it meant she sincerely regretted regarding Gu Ning as her enemy.

“Well, I accept your gratitude and apology,” said Gu Ning in a flat voice. Although she would forgive Leng Shaojia and wouldn’t bother to pay her back, it would be hard for her to be nice to Leng Shaojia right away.

After all, what Leng Shaojia had done to her was over the top. If someone else had done the same thing to her, she would have put the person in jail.

Leng Yuanqian, on the other hand, was slightly surprised. He didn’t expect Leng Shaojia to apologize to Gu Ning and thank her on her own. Her attitude was also very sincere which was what he wanted to see, so he felt comforted.

“Thanks.” Leng Shaojia thanked Gu Ning again. She understood that it wasn’t easy to win Gu Ning’s forgiveness, but she indeed felt much better now. It wouldn’t be as uncomfortable for her to be with Gu Ning in the future.

After that, Gu Ning took out a power crystal and handed it to Leng Shaojia. “Take this and you’ll feel much better.”

Before that, Gu Ning had no intention of giving Leng Shaojia a power crystal, but she changed her attitude after Leng Shaojia apologized.

“Thanks.” Leng Shaojia accepted Gu Ning’s kindness because there was pain all over her body and she wanted to get better.

Leng Yuanqian didn’t remember that Gu Ning had these magical pills until then.

He had mixed emotions, but he felt relieved. He knew Leng Shaojia’s apology couldn’t win Gu Ning’s forgiveness, but their relationship was much better than before.

A few minutes after Leng Shaojia took the power crystal, she felt the pain all over her body reducing by a lot and felt much more comfortable.

After Gu Ning noticed that some people were following them, she stopped talking and turned to pay attention to those men.

Due to her Jade Eyes, she could clearly see the distance between them.

In the beginning, those men followed them from a short distance away, but they suddenly sped up when they reached a remote road. It seemed that they had decided to take action right there.

Because they were ready to attack them, Gu Ning chose to wait to see what they could do.

As a result, she asked the chauffeur to stop and the car behind also stopped.

The chauffeur served the minister of Foreign Affairs, so he didn’t listen to Gu Ning, but asked the minister instead, “Minister…”

The minister looked at Leng Yuanqian for his opinions. “Secretary Leng…”

“Stop,” said Leng Yuanqian.

Since Leng Yuanqian gave the order, the chauffeur stopped at once. Then he turned on the car lights to signal the car behind them to stop as well.

In the car behind them were bodyguards and a lawyer who came with Leng Yuanqian.

After the two cars stopped, Gu Ning told them to stay in the cars, then she got out alone.

“Secretary Leng, are you sure we should listen to her?” When Gu Ning was gone, the minister asked with disapproval because he felt Gu Ning was just a young girl, so she shouldn’t be the decision-maker.

“She’s the leader of this group, so we all need to listen to her. Everything will go well only if we listen to her,” said Leng Yuanqian. He wasn’t dissatisfied at all when Gu Ning gave the orders. Instead, he was more than happy to do what she said because only Gu Ning could solve the problems properly.

If it hadn’t been for Gu Ning, they wouldn’t have gotten Leng Shaojia out so easily!

“What?” Hearing that, the minister was shocked. Although he knew that they listened to Gu Ning most of the time, he didn’t expect Gu Ning to be their leader. She was just a young girl!

“I can’t tell you much about it, but we relied on her to leave safely,” said Leng Yuanqian.

Knowing that, the minister was astonished, but Leng Yuanqian had said that he couldn’t tell him much, so he didn’t ask further about it.

After Gu Ning got out of the car, she directly went to the car that Si Jin was in and asked her to get out. At the same time, the others stayed in the car.

Although the other people didn’t know what was going on, they listened to Gu Ning and didn’t ask.

Si Jin understood Gu Ning’s intention.

When Si Jin was out of the car, they stood there. Before the car that was following them reached them, they had damaged the surveillance cameras with their magical energy.

The power of magical energy was totally beyond human imagination, so Gu Ning and Si Jin quietly damaged the surveillance cameras in order to prevent other people from seeing what they w9uld be doing later.

Right after they damaged the surveillance cameras, the car that followed them arrived.

Those men were surprised when they saw Gu Ning waiting for them, and they realized that they had been exposed. However, since this was a remote place, it was a good chance for them to take action.

When they got near Gu Ning’s car they stopped their car, but they didn’t get out. Instead, they rolled down their car windows and immediately shot at Gu Ning and Si Jin.

Leng Yuanqian and the others, who were sitting in the cars, were scared. They were afraid that Gu Ning and Si Jin might be injured, even though they knew that Gu Ning and Si Jin were unbelievably strong.

However, Gu Ning and Si Jin didn’t give them a chance to hurt them. Before the men were even ready to shoot, Gu Ning and Si Jin had rushed forward and given their car a magical energy infused kick.

Then, shockingly, everyone watched their car suddenly roll over, causing the bullets they shot to shoot into the sky.

At that moment, everyone was struck dumb, because Gu Ning and Si Jin kicked a large MPV over and it even contained many men!

Were they really human? They were gods!

This time, the minister understood why Leng Yuanqian let Gu Ning be the leader, because she had noticed that some people were following them and dared to fight against those men. In addition, she directly kicked the car over. Clearly this girl wasn’t ordinary!
