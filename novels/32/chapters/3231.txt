3234 Obviously It’s a Scheme

“Because I have a special body, no one can tell that I’m a cultivator when I don’t use my magical power,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t know the details. She only found that out when she encountered an evil cultivator last time. The evil cultivator didn’t sense that she was also a cultivator, so she found that she could hide her level.

That said, the ghost didn’t ask more. After all, it should be a secret.

“Oh, we’ve talked a lot, but what are your names?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

Leng Xiaoyao talked most of the time and seemed more important than Li Mochen. However, Li Mochen’s mind was in a mess right now. He couldn’t understand what was going on all of a sudden, while Leng Xiaoyao was much more clear-headed. She also knew more about cultivators, so it was easier for her to communicate with them.

In addition, Li Mochen didn’t care about it either. Instead, he felt lucky that Leng Xiaoyao was here, otherwise he would be even more confused.

Today, he learned more about Leng Xiaoyao’s extraordinariness. Leng Xiaoyao turned out to be more special than he thought. Perhaps she still had more surprises that he didn’t know about.

“My name is Leng Yan. This is Chi Feng and Luo Han,” the ghost named Leng Yan introduced.

“Oh, do many people know about this place?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“Some passers-by have noticed this place, but they were all scared away by the creepy yard. No one dared to come inside.” Leng Yan said, “But, we’ve never hurt anyone.”

“What you said is very strange to me. If it’s true, I’ll talk to you about the details after getting my memories back,” Li Mochen said. He couldn’t remember anything right now, so it was meaningless no matter how much they told him now. It would only be meaningful after he remembered everything.

He didn’t tell them that he felt that the ancient building was very familiar. Even if he believed them to some extent because of the familiar feeling, he wouldn’t be honest with them until he had control of the situation.

“Sure.” Leng Yan and the others answered. They understood that Li Mochen didn’t have any memories about them so it was meaningless no matter how much they talked about things. Anyway, Li Mochen already learned what he should know. As for the other things, that relied on him remembering them.

For example, the formation in the backyard and the delivery formation could only be opened by Li Mochen.

“Let’s go!” Li Mochen turned to look at Leng Xiaoyao. Afterwards, they turned around and left.

Once they came out, Mu Yiyang and the others surrounded them. “What happened just then?” asked Mu Yiyang.

“I was startled by a mouse and subconsciously hit at it, but I only hit the stone fence. It broke,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Oh!”

Mu Yiyang didn’t doubt her reply. Ordinary people couldn’t break a stone fence, but Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t ordinary. So it was possible.

“Did you find anything?” asked Meng Fan.

“Not yet, but it’s filled with evil power. There must be evil things inside, so it’s very dangerous,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Since Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen had observed the ancient building and found nothing, they didn’t stay there and left at once.

“When will you go back?” asked Mu Yiyang.

“In fact, this task wasn’t assigned to us, it was meant to be the Feiyu Team. However, because they couldn’t finish it even after a long time, the leader ordered us to help. We didn’t care and were willing to help, but the Feiyu Team seemed displeased when we came. They aren’t being cooperative and asked us to act separately. We were following the suspects, but they alerted them right when we entered Mount Qinjiao. On the way, we found the ancient building. Because we were mad at the Feiyu Team, we returned to the city center. Actually, we planned to catch the suspects to teach the Feiyu Team a lesson, but I don’t think it’s important right now. We can just leave it to them,” Mu Yiyang said.

As a soldier, it was his duty to catch and prevent evil, but he had a temper too. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

There were grudges between his team and the Feiyu Team, but he was still willing to help. However, the Feiyu Team wasn’t professional and took action before them due to being too competitive. It was impossible for him not to get angry!

Mu Yiyang was very honest with Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao, because he believed that they would keep it a secret.

All of a sudden, Leng Xiaoyao smiled mysteriously. “Perhaps we can meet them tonight!”

Coincidentally, when Mu Yiyang brought it up, Leng Xiaoyao used her magical senses trying to find the Feiyu Team. A while later, she heard several extremely low voices.

Given their conversation, she bet they were the suspects Mu Yiyang was looking for.

“What?”

Mu Yiyang was struck dumb for a second. He joked. “Can you sense where they are right now?”

“We can go and see,” Leng Xiaoyao said, before walking towards the suspects.

No one doubted Leng Xiaoyao’s decision. Whether she really sensed them or was wrong, the fact that she found the ancient house with her senses proved her ability.

They would see whether she was wrong. Even if she was wrong, they would just take it as exercise.

“I think it’s a scheme that you were sent here,” Li Mochen said confidently. It wasn’t a secret in the military that Mu Yiyang’s team didn’t get along with the Feiyu Team.

However, their leader still assigned Mu Yiyang to help the Feiyu Team in order to make them have conflicts.

When the two teams took action together and Mu Yiyang’s team caught the suspects, Feiyu Team would be embarrassed. It would make them hate one another even more.

However, if the Feiyu Team caught the suspects, Mu Yiyang’s team would be embarrassed.

Only when they caught the suspects by working together would everyone be fine. However, obviously the Feiyu Team didn’t want to be cooperative.

“Right, it has something to do with the Shen family.” Mu Yiyang suddenly was displeased. “But it’s an order. We can’t disobey it, so I agreed. I also tried to work with them, but they refused. I don’t care. After all, we don’t care about fame as much as the Feiyu Team does.”

The Shen family was one of the seven most powerful families in the capital city. It didn’t get along with the Mu family and never missed any chances to make things difficult for the Mu family. Mu Yiyang was already used to it.
