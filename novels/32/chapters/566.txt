Chapter 567 Gu Man Is Abducted

There was twelve thousand yuan in each of the red envelopes Gu Ning sent to them because the number had a special meaning.

Half an hour later, they arrived at the airport. When they got the boarding cards and waited in the lounge, it was almost 5 pm. Twenty minutes later, Chu Peihan and the others boarded, so only Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were left there.

“Ningning, will you go back to your house tonight?” Leng Shaoting asked Gu Ning. However, he was expecting her to say no.

“I’ll call my mom first when we’re back in City B. If she’s fine, I can stay outside,” Gu Ning said. She was still worried about Gu Man.

“Sure,” Leng Shaoting said. Gu Man was his future mother-in-law after all.

Chu Peihan and the others arrived at City Fat 6:40 pm, while Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting wouldn’t arrive at City B until 9 pm. However, when it was about 8 pm, a scary scene appeared in Gu Ning’s mind. In the vision, an MPV hit the private car in which Gu Man and a chauffeur sent by the Tang family drove, on a road with little traffic. Although nobody was injured, it wasn’t a simple car accident.

When the private car was forced to stop after the heavy knock, four men suddenly got out of the MPV, and they were all wearing masks, so nobody could see their faces. Once they were out of the MPV, they caught Gu Man and the chauffeur. Although the chauffeur struggled, he was easily beaten down by those bulky men. Both Gu Man and the chauffeur were abducted within a few minutes.

Gu Ning’s face turned pale at once and her body was trembling in fear, anger and worry.

“Ningning, what happened?” Leng Shaoting was surprised.

“I-I had a terrible premonition. I think my mom is in danger,” Gu Ning said.

Leng Shaoting understood that Gu Ning’s premonitions were always right, so he felt nervous and concerned too. However, they were still on a plane and it was impossible for them to check Gu Man’s condition now. “Ningning, don’t worry. You mother will be fine.”

Gu Ning also knew that she couldn’t contact her mother now because she was on a plane, so she did her best to calm herself down, and hoped that Gu Man would be safe.

No matter who did that to her mother, she would pay them back.

In City B, the traffic police arrived at the scene soon after the car accident happened but there was nobody left there except the broken private car. The traffic police were confused, then checked the surveillance cameras, and saw the exact same scene that had appeared in Gu Ning’s mind.

The traffic police checked the license plates at once, and it turned out that the number plate of the MPV was fake, while that of the private car belonged to the Tang family.

Knowing that, everyone in the traffic police team panicked, and they immediately took action to search for the missing victims. The moment their leader heard that the Tang family was involved in this car accident, he didn’t hesitate to call the Tang family.

When the Tang family heard that Gu Man was abducted, they were all scared too and did everything they could to find Gu Man. Of course, they had to let Gu Ning know too. However, Gu Ning’s phone was powered off.

Apparently, the group of people who had abducted Gu Man were fully-prepared, so Tang Haifeng failed to find Gu Man and the chauffeur even though he did everything he could right away. The Tang family only found the MPV which was abandoned on a small road in a suburb. The number plate of the MPV was fake, so they couldn’t find its owner. Besides, there were no surveillance cameras around the place where the car was abandoned.

When it was 9 pm, the plane finally landed at the airport of City B. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting left the airport in a hurry.

The moment they were out, Gu Ning turned on her phone, and saw many missed calls from Tang Haifeng. Without a doubt, Gu Ning knew that Gu Man had to be in danger now, so she called Tang Haifeng back.

“Ningning, you mother was abducted,” Tang Haifeng said once Gu Ning called him.

“What do we know?” Gu Ning asked.

“Those bulky men all had masks on their faces, so we don’t know who they are, and the number plate of the MPV is fake so we can’t find its owner. We followed the surveillance cameras and found a small road, but there was only an abandoned car without any people around,” Tang Haifeng said.

“Tell me the location and I’ll check it myself,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Tang Haifeng knew that Gu Ning was back in City B now and he sent the location to her without delay. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Leng Shaoting drove the car Shengshi Group prepared for him at the highest speed to the location where the abandoned MPV was founded.

Within 20 minutes, they arrived. However, even though they came here, they didn’t know which direction those men had escaped in.

Gu Ning immediately used her Jade Eyes to scan the surroundings, hoping to find something that might have been lost by those men. Unfortunately, she found nothing.

Right when Gu Ning was in despair, a picture flashed by her eyes, and it showed the direction in which Gu Man and the chauffeur were dragged

“This way!” Gu Ning said to Leng Shaoting then ran in that direction. Because it was a wasteland, they couldn’t drive, but had to walk. After running for about a hundred meters, Gu Ning stopped, because she lost the direction again.

Gu Ning had her Jade Eyes, so she was able to see things clearly in the night but Leng Shaoting couldn’t. Therefore, Gu Ning gave him the night-luminescent pearl, and they started to search for traces of people’s footsteps.

Before long, Gu Ning found some, so they ran ahead following the traces. They followed the traces for over three hundred meters then came to another small road with traces of tire tracks. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoyu thought that those men might have taken another car to escape after they had dragged Gu Man and the chauffeur here.

Nevertheless, there were no surveillance cameras here, so they didn’t know which direction the car left in. Accordingly, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting had to search for them in two opposite directions.

Gu Ning ran rapidly ahead, checking the surroundings at the same time. She knew that they could have stopped anywhere by the road.
