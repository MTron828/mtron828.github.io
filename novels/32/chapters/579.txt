Chapter 580 Is She Gorgeous?

When Xia Yichu came to the company again after a few days, everyone was stunned.

“Are-are you really Xia Yichu?” someone asked. In fact, a scar couldn’t affect a person’s overall facial features, so others still recognized Xia Yichu at first glance, but the scar disappeared too fast, which was beyond belief.

“Are you Xia Yichu’s twin sister?” another person asked.

Xia Yichu was amused. “I’m Xia Yichu.”

Hearing that, everyone was surprised again.

“Did you have plastic surgery?” someone asked.

However, it wasn’t very likely, because it took at least a few months to recover from plastic surgery, but Xia Yichu became beautiful after just three days.

“I didn’t,” Xia Yichu said.

Xia Yichu understood that they were all surprised, but she wouldn’t tell them the real reason without Gu Ning’s permission, so she made an excuse to meet Lu Xiao in his office.

When Lu Xiao saw Xia Yichu, he was stunned as well. It was unreasonable that she couldn’t be popular with such a beautiful face and outstanding singing voice.

“Did you have plastic surgery?” Lu Xiao asked the same question.

“No, I used the potion boss gave me,” Xia Yichu said. There was no need for her to hide it from Lu Xiao.

“Really?” Lu Xiao was more curious about Gu Ning now. He hadn’t met her yet, but he believed that she couldn’t be a simple girl. In addition, Gu Ning was able to become Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend, which was a miracle in Lu Xiao’s eyes.

All of a sudden, Lu Xiao asked with curiosity, “By the way, how much do you know about our boss?”

“Not much. I just met her once, and it was actually a big gamble for me to leave City B for the capital and work for Fenghua Entertainment,” Xia Yichu said. She felt very lucky to have met Gu Ning and changed her future.

Lu Xiao, of course, was very clear about what Xia Yichu had been through, because he needed to deal with Qiao Guanxiang for her as her leader.

“Is she gorgeous?” Lu Xiao asked again. He thought that Leng Shaoting was extraordinarily handsome, so Gu Ning had to be a beauty too.

Xia Yichu, however, was surprised that Lu Xiao had never met Gu Ning before.

Seeing Xia Yichu being so surprised, Lu Xiao explained. “I didn’t meet our boss, because it was our boss’s boyfriend who assigned me this task to manage this company for the time being. When I successfully help our boss train another person to be a qualified manager, my task is fulfilled.” After that, he said, “Don’t tell anyone about that. Keep it a secret!”

“Sure, I won’t,” Xia Yichu said at once.

“Oh, your agent is already here. Although you’re a good singer, you still need to work hard and make progress in the future. Since you’ve never been on the stage before, you have to learn more skills for that. Don’t worry, we’ll arrange comprehensive classes for you before your debut,” Lu Xiao said.

“Thanks, Manager Lu,” Xia Yichu said.

Tang Deming called Zhang Yongjian again in the morning, but still couldn’t get through to Zhang Yongjian, and he started to feel that their scheme could have been exposed.

He called Xin Zi later, and Xin Zi answered his call.

“They found Gu Man yesterday, but Gu Man didn’t go back to the Tang family’s house, so I don’t know the details,” Xin Zi said.

Tang Haifeng allowed him to say that, because it would arouse suspicion if Xin Zi didn’t answer the call and Xin Zi’s son would get hurt.

Hearing that, Tang Deming believed Xin Zi.

When Xin Zi left the Tang family’s house, he called his wife and told her to not send their son to school today, and that they would be going back to their hometown.

When Gu Ning was about to set off for the Tang family’s house, Leng Shaoting told Gu Ning that he had to leave.

In fact, Leng Shaoting had received a call early in the morning, but he didn’t leave until he had shared breakfast with them.

Gu Ning understood that Leng Shaoting was assigned a task, and that he had to leave to fulfill it.

Gu Ning and Gu Man then walked Leng Shaoting to the door after breakfast, and Leng Shaoting left Gu Ning unwillingly.

In the beginning, Gu Man didn’t believe that Gu Ning already had a boyfriend at such a young age but she changed her mind when she noticed Leng Shaoting looking tenderly at Gu Ning. If they were just common friends, he wouldn’t be so unwilling to leave her Therefore, once Leng Shaoting was gone, Gu Man asked Gu Ning seriously, “Ningning, are you sure Shaoting is just your friend?”

ionship, because young girls could be easily deceived by men when they were in love. Although Leng Shaoting had left a good impression on Gu Man and they had gotten along well during the past few days, Gu Man still knew very little about him. Most importantly, Gu Ning was very young and Gu Man was worried about her safety.

Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second then said, “Mom, since you already have doubts, I don’t want to lie to you. Shaoting is my boyfriend and we love each other very much. We’re not just playing. I think he’s my Mr. Right and both of us hope that we can get married someday in the future.”
