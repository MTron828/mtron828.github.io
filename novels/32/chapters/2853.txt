Chapter 2854: It’s a Huge Waste

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“If you like seafood so much, we can stay by the sea for several days when we are free. We can eat fresh seafood every meal. If you want to catch seafood, we can do that too,” said Leng Shaoting. He suddenly realized that they hadn’t taken a trip together ever since they got together.

Although they had spent time together many times before, they usually did it for business, so Leng Shaoting wanted them to purely enjoy themselves once.

Hearing Leng Shaoting’s idea, Gu Ning got excited. She remembered when she went to City Gang last time, she could choose whatever seafood she wanted to eat, and the seafood wasn’t very expensive.

“Great! But where should we go?” asked Gu Ning. Her anger completely going away at that moment.

“Where do you want to go? You can choose,” said Leng Shaoting. He would go where Gu Ning wanted to.

“I need to think about that,” said Gu Ning.

“Sure, there is no need to rush. After the situation in the capital stabilizes, we can take a vacation,” said Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning snorted with laughter. “I don’t think a vacation is rare to me, because I have so much free time that other students don’t have. I only need to go to school for tests.”

“That’s because you’re outstanding! You’re an excellent student even though you don’t go to class. And you own such a large business group even though you’re just a student. Your school is proud of you. If an average student dared to be absent for a class or two, he or she would probably be heavily criticized!” said Leng Shaoting. He was extremely proud of Gu Ning.

“Well, if I was an ordinary girl, it’d be a waste of my second chance at life,” said Gu Ning proudly.

Talking about Gu Ning’s reincarnation, Leng Shaoting felt very lucky. Luckily, Gu Ning was reincarnated, or he wouldn’t have had the chance to meet her.

Not far from the hotel they were staying in was a seafood restaurant, so they went there.

Because they were rich, Gu Ning ordered everything she wanted to eat.

Although there were only two of them, they ordered enough food for four people.

City Rui was far from the ocean, so seafood was very expensive here so Gu Ning’s order shocked the service staff.

She ordered two king crabs, two Australian lobsters, four abalones, six French Belon oysters, and several kinds of seafood with high prices.

This meal would cost thousands of yuan!

The service staff had seen many rich people because they worked there, but normally people would mainly order medium priced seafood with a few pieces of expensive seafood.

In addition, other diners would order other dishes besides seafood.

Moreover, there were only two of them, but they ordered food for four people. Could they eat all the food? If the service staff gave them less seafood at the same price, they might not even notice.

An attendant gave a glance at Gu Ning, then at Leng Shaoting. He couldn’t help but wonder whether Leng Shaoting would be displeased because the girl ordered a lot of seafood.

Even though they were rich, it wasn’t a cheap meal!

What was their relationship? Were they a couple or lovers?

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting noticed that the attendant was sizing them up. They didn’t know what he was thinking, but it had to be about them.

However, no matter what he was thinking, as long as he didn’t say it aloud, they wouldn’t argue with him.

After ordering, Gu Ning was afraid the service staff might give them less food at the same price, so she deliberately reminded. “There are only two of us, but we can eat a lot. What we’ve ordered isn’t much for us. Please serve the food equal to its price.”

Gu Ning didn’t humiliate them, but it wasn’t uncommon for restaurants to serve less food at high prices.

“Miss, don’t worry, we won’t do that!” the attendant said at once, feeling a little guilty.

He wondered whether Gu Ning could see through him or if it was just a worry she had.

Either way, since Gu Ning pointed it out, he would remind the cook to do his job properly.

After all, Gu Ning spent a lot of money at their restaurant, they must provide a reasonable service.

They would sometimes serve less food at expensive prices, but they wouldn’t do it too much. If diners were like Gu Ning, who was very smart, they wouldn’t dare to play that trick.

Since Gu Ning could afford expensive seafood, she couldn’t be an ordinary person. If they dared to upset her, it would be a loss for their restaurant.

Afterwards, the attendant walked away.

When the attendant was gone, Gu Ning asked, “Are we eating too much in their eyes?”

“It’s not important. We are paying for the food anyway,” said Leng Shaoting. He couldn’t care less about other people’s thoughts.

When the attendant came out, he went to deliver Gu Ning’s order at the reception desk. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The receptionist was a young woman so she was very surprised when she looked at Gu Ning’s order. “There are just two of them. Why did they order so much seafood? It’s a huge waste.”

At the same time, she got jealous too, because this meal cost a month of her salary.

Most importantly, she saw Leng Shaoting when they walked in earlier and was impressed by him.

Gu Ning was also beautiful, so she was jealous. She wished that she could be Gu Ning, so that she could be rich and eat whatever she wanted to.

“She said that they can eat a lot,” said the attendant.

“There are only two of them. I don’t think they can eat much. Are they pigs?” the woman asked acidly.

“Hey, mind your words! They’re customers. And it’s their order. Why are you being so mean?” The attendant saw that the woman was jealous and frowned with displeasure.

Although it had nothing to do with him if the woman was jealous, it was highly disrespectful towards their customers. If Gu Ning heard her and got mad, it would be their loss.

“It’s none of your business!” The woman argued angrily.

“Alright, alright, put through the order right now. I don’t want the boss to see us.” The attendant was unwilling to argue with this woman and urged her to do her job.

The woman was displeased, but still went back to her work.

After putting through the order, the attendant went to the kitchen with the bill, then reminded the cook to prepare food equal to the prices.

Hearing that, the cook knew what he should do.
