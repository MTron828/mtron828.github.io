918 From Hell

“What’s going on?”

“No idea, it’s so scary!”

“It sounds like a voice from hell.”

“Don’t scare me. There is no hell in this world.”

“I don’t know whether there is a hell or not, but the ground is shaking. Is it an earthquake?”

“Earthquake? Will this small island sink? I don’t want to die young!”

“Me either! Are you dying?”

...

Around 20 minutes later, the male ghost stopped struggling and was burnt completely.

After that, Gu Ning left. She let the yacht out, then went to the blockage in the passage. When she got there she put the yacht away, and dived into the sea. After leaving the passage, she surfaced again far from the shore.

Gu Ning observed the surroundings for a while. When she was sure that there was nobody in her sight, she took the yacht out again, and sailed away.

Those men who were left on the small island didn’t notice the yacht in the beginning, but they began to shout to it once they noticed it after it moved farther away.

However, no matter how loudly they shouted, Gu Ning couldn’t hear them because of the sea wind. And even if she heard them, she would ignore them.

When she was about to arrive, she disguised herself as “Tang Aining” again, then went back to the wharf.

After returning the yacht, Gu Ning took a taxi and went back to the Gonghao Hotel.

Staff members of Fenghua Entertainment paid attention to the news about their company the entire time. They didn’t know that their real boss was an 18-year-old girl until now.
