3417 I’ll Make Arrangements for Them

Not only was the boy shocked, An Chenmeng and others were also shocked by Leng Xiaoyao’s actions.

“What’s your name? Why did you steal the phone?” Leng Xiaoyao asked sternly.

“I, my name is Tang Xing…” The boy said weakly. He was afraid of Leng Xiaoyao and dared not meet her eyes. “My sister and I haven’t eaten for two days. I had no choice, so…”

Tang Xing!

This name also sounded familiar to Leng Xiaoyao.

Although she couldn’t remember the details, it seemed that she knew this person from the previous incarnation.

Since she had some memory, she had to figure it out.

“Where is your sister?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“S-She’s home,” Tang Xing said.

“Take us to see her,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“What do you want to do?” Tang Xing was on guard, afraid that Leng Xiaoyao would harm them.

“Don’t worry! I won’t hurt you! I’ll give you something to eat,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Then she turned to Xiong Manxin. “Go buy two bowls of congee next to us. They haven’t eaten for two days. it’s better for them to eat something light first. Otherwise it’s not good for the stomach.”

“Sure!”

Xiong Manxin was struck dumb for a second and was surprised by Leng Xiaoyao’s decision, but she said nothing about it and immediately went to buy food.

Although An Chenmeng was annoyed by the thief who stole her phone, she wouldn’t disagree with Leng Xiaoyao at this moment. After all, this boy looked really pitiful.

She decided to be kind!

Tang Xing was still worried, but he couldn’t refuse when he saw that Leng Xiaoyao really gave him congee. His sister had already fallen ill. If she didn’t eat anything else, she might die of starvation.

Therefore, Tang Xing took Leng Xiaoyao over, with worries and gratitude in his mind.

Because he was worried about his sister, Tang Xing walked very fast. After about fifteen minutes, they arrived at an old house in an old alley. The door led to a small courtyard of about ten square meters. It wasn’t big.

There was a big tree in the yard that had been there for many years. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

This abandoned house was burned everywhere, so there were almost no usable things inside.

Seeing that scene, An Chenmeng and the others who were previously annoyed were touched. They were full of sympathy and pity at that moment.

Therefore, the media reported it and Tang Xing’s name and photo were posted online. She had seen it before and even criticized that family for being cold-blooded.

The medical expenses were paid for by the driver who caused the accident. This family didn’t need to pay anything except to buy some gifts to thank Tang Xing and to give him a red envelope, but they didn’t do it. They were really ungrateful.

Leng Xiaoyao finally remembered it. Even though it was something that happened in the previous incarnation, she still hated that family very much when she thought of it.

Therefore, she felt it necessary to remind Tang Xing to just stand by when encountering such situations.

Tang Xing could sacrifice himself to save others, which also proved that he was a good person. So she was moved with compassion and decided to help them.

“Sister, sister, I brought food back. Get up and eat. You won’t get sick after you eat.” Tang Xing ran towards his sister, Tang Ning, with congee, but Tang Ning lying on the ground didn’t respond.

“Sister…” Tang Xing became anxious and immediately helped Tang Ning up.

Leng Xiaoyao also noticed that something was wrong and walked over. She squatted in front of Tang Ning. She found that Tang Ning’s face was very red.

She touched her forehead with her hand and found that it was hot. Obviously, she had a fever, and it was quite serious.

Leng Xiaoyao immediately poured magical power into her body.

“How is my sister? Will she die?” Tang Xing was extremely worried. After relying on each other for survival, he shed tears, which he rarely did. For his sister, he even committed the crime he hated the most, theft, and was caught for the first time.

He was lucky. The person who caught him was a good person who even bought them congee.

“Don’t worry! She has a slight fever. Everything will be fine.” Leng Xiaoyao comforted him. She couldn’t tell the truth to avoid worrying Tang Xing. With her magical power, Tang Ning would be fine and would recover from the fever soon.

Hearing that, Tang Xing felt relieved.

“Boss, they are so pitiful. Shall we help them?” Xiong Manxin said. They were all well-off and had more than enough to help these two poor children.

Xiong Manxin wasn’t blindly helping them. She wanted to provide them with good conditions to study and become self-sufficient in the future.

If they were just idle people, she wouldn’t be so warm-hearted.

Upon hearing that, Tang Xing was excited.

He didn’t mind being alone and didn’t care if anyone helped him because he was already a big boy, but his sister couldn’t do it alone. She was young and needed help. Otherwise, they would get into trouble sooner or later.

“Don’t worry, I’ll make arrangements for them,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Then she turned to Tang Xing and said, “Tang Xing, if you’re willing to listen to me, I can settle you and your sister down and provide you with education, but I don’t support idle people. While I’m helping you, you also need to work hard and become self-sufficient in the future.”

Tang Xing was moved, but couldn’t accept it right away. He said seriously, “Thank you for your kindness, but sister, you look like a student. I don’t want to burden you. I just want you to help my sister. I can go to work and earn money. When I have money, I will take care of my sister myself and repay you.”

“No one dares to hire underage workers! Where will you work? With your thin arms and legs, what can you do? It’s better for you to study hard now and work for my company after graduation. You can help me do things well to repay me,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“You have a company?” Tang Xing was surprised. This girl didn’t look much older than him, but she already had a company…

“Yes, so providing education for you won’t be a burden for me. I don’t need you to repay me excessively. I just need you to be honest and not betray me,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She wouldn’t tolerate any betrayal from them.

She could help them unconditionally today, but if they ever betrayed her, she would make them pay the price without mercy.
