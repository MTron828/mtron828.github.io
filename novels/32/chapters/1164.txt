Chapter 1165 A Body Thrown into the River

The others were surprised, not because Colaine belonged to Gu Ning, but because Gu Ning owned another company within such a short time. Her business empire grew too fast!“Wow, you own another company so quickly!” Master Bai said in surprise.

“Right, and it seems quite profitable,” Master Fu said.

“You’re indeed a talented businesswoman!” Master Yan said.

Since it was Gu Ning’s company, they believed that this product had to be very effective.

...

During the meal, they enjoyed talking with each other in a relaxed atmosphere.

At the beginning, Bai Xueyan could join their conversation, but she was gradually ignored, so she turned to enjoy the food by herself.

When they were about to separate, Bai Xueyan asked Gu Ning, “Gu Ning, when will you leave City G?”

“Tomorrow. I’ll go to City B and stay there for a few days before I go back to my school for the National College Entrance Examination,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Master Bai and the others realized that Gu Ning was still a student and that she was about to attend the National College Entrance Examination.

They wished Gu Ning all the best before they left.

Gu Ning then told Gao Yi to drive her to Clean Water Blue Sky before they went back to the hotel.

She got out of the car at the gate of Clean Water Blue Sky, but she didn’t want to go back to her apartment right away. Instead, she took a taxi and headed to a river.

The jiao hadn’t touched water for a long time, and Gu Ning thought that she should let it out to have some fresh air.

It was May, and it was still a little hot, so there were many people wandering by the river to cool themselves down.

Gu Ning planned to set the jiao into the river, and she had to do that in a place where there were no other people around her. Therefore, she walked downstream.

All of a sudden, a woman stopped her. “Hey, young girl, stop there! Are you walking downstream? If so, you better give it up. It’s not safe there. A girl did the same thing not long ago after being dumped by her boyfriend, but she was raped by a man and her body was thrown into the river. Nobody knows where the criminal is right now.”

Knowing that, Gu Ning put on a serious face. She hated rapists, and had sympathy for the victim.

“Thank you so much for your kindness. I won’t go there,” Gu Ning said.

The woman felt relieved and kindly reminded Gu Ning to go home early.

After the woman was gone, Gu Ning continued to walk downstream. Ordinary people might be scared of a place where a person was just killed, but Gu Ning didn’t mind it at all.

She let the jiao out once there was nobody around her.

The jiao swam into the river without delay and Gu Ning went to have a seat by the river.

However, the jiao emerged from the river after a short while and said to Gu Ning, “My master, there is a female ghost under the river, but she was scared away by me.”

Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second.

The female ghost could be the innocent girl’s ghost!

It was just Gu Ning’s guess, and it could be other people’s ghosts. However, since there was a female ghost in the river, Gu Ning decided to check it herself.

As time went by, Gu Ning began to take it as her duty to wipe out all kinds of monsters and ghosts. It was kind of her destiny. She always ran into monsters and ghosts, and they were bad for ordinary human beings.

In addition, she found that there was a strong energy inside her body that increased every time she eliminated a monster or a ghost. She couldn’t figure it out, but felt that it was beneficial.

“I’ll put you into the telepathic eye space now, and then let you out again when I find the female ghost,” Gu Ning said.

“No problem,” the jiao said.

After that, Gu Ning put on a wetsuit and dived into the river.

Since the female ghost was already scared away by the jiao, she wouldn’t be nearby, but she wouldn’t be far away either.

Gu Ning released her magical power at once to attract the female ghost. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Smelling the magical power, the female ghost went to Gu Ning without hesitation.

The female ghost was about 20, dressed in a white summer dress with her hair tied into a ponytail.

It was filled with negative feelings, but the Yin she was covered in wasn’t dark, which meant that she had only been dead for a short time. The Yin was produced by her hatred after her death.

Gu Ning was now sure that this girl was the innocent victim that the woman told her about.

The female ghost stopped when it was three meters away from Gu Ning.

It stopped, not because it knew Gu Ning was very powerful, but because it didn’t want to hurt human beings.

The female ghost was surprised that the magical power came from a human, instead of an object. It thought that the object with magical power might be on Gu Ning’s body.

Gu Ning knew what the female ghost was thinking, and she thought that it was very kind.

“Are you the girl who was raped and killed not a long ago?” Gu Ning asked.
