3423 Negotiate Wages

“Sister, you’re back!” Tang Xing and Tang Ning shouted. Although they knew that Leng Xiaoyao was their cousin, they still preferred to call her sister, feeling that it was more intimate.

Although she didn’t have any emotional connection with them, she felt close to them because of their blood ties.

“Hello, I’m your sister’s boyfriend, Li Mochen. You can call me brother-in-law or brother.” Li Mochen greeted them warmly. Knowing that his stern demeanor could be intimidating. He tried to appear gentle and approachable.

Although he preferred to be called brother-in-law, Leng Xiaoyao hadn’t yet made their relationship public, so Li Mochen was fine with being called brother.

When Leng Xiaoyao heard the word brother-in-law, she frowned and wanted to say something, but held back in front of the outsider.

She couldn’t embarrass him in front of others.

Tang Xing and Tang Ning looked at Leng Xiaoyao for her opinion on how to address Li Mochen. Leng Xiaoyao said, “Just call him brother for now!”

Li Mochen was upset, feeling a bit resentful towards Leng Xiaoyao. Leng Xiaoyao, however, was very satisfied.

“Brother, nice to meet you!” Tang Xing and Tang Ning both greeted Li Mochen politely. Because Li Mochen tried his best to be gentle, the two children weren’t afraid of him. On the contrary, because he was so handsome, they were amazed. They had a very good impression of him.

Li Mochen handed the two children two thick red envelopes. “This is a gift for you at our first meeting.”

Each envelope contained ten thousand yuan. They didn’t need to worry about anything since they lived here, so there was no need to give too much.

However, not many people could casually give ten thousand yuan as a gift to children. Not all rich people were that generous.

Tang Xing and Tang Ning hesitated to accept the gift and looked at Leng Xiaoyao for her opinion.

“You can take it,” said Leng Xiaoyao.

The two kids accepted the red envelopes and thanked Li Mochen. “Thank you, brother.”

Leng Xiaoyao then asked Li Mochen to cook while she talked to the tutors, maid, and driver about their work arrangement.

They were here, but Leng Xiaoyao still needed to discuss their schedule and salary with them in person. So before that, she had already researched the average salary in the industry.

“Let’s start with Aunt Tong! I have two options for your job arrangement. First, full-time, which means living here and making three meals a day, cleaning the first-floor, the two children’s rooms, hallway, and stairs. You can have one day off per week, either Saturday or Sunday. Just let me know in advance. The second option is to provide two meals and first-floor hygiene. You can come before 11 am. After cooking and cleaning up, you can either rest here or go back home, and come back when it’s time to prepare dinner. For full-time, the salary is fifteen thousand yuan per month. The second option is nine thousand yuan plus a transportation allowance of a thousand yuan, which comes to ten thousand yuan per month. The meals must be nutritious because the two children have poor health and need to be supplemented. Money isn’t a problem, but it can’t be wasted either. You can eat the two meals together with them. After having the meal and cleaning up, you can go home. If you want to live here, I can also arrange a room for you.” Leng Xiaoyao listed all the conditions.

The salary offered by Leng Xiaoyao was already considered high in the capital city. Although some people might have higher salaries, they also demanded higher requirements. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

With fewer family members and lighter responsibilities, it was an easy job.

Although she had received professional training and worked as a housekeeper for wealthy families, she had many duties and the highest salary was only twelve thousand yuan!

Therefore, Tong Xianglan immediately agreed. “Boss, my daughter is already married, so I’m alone now. I’ll work full-time. There are many people here, so I won’t feel lonely. Don’t worry, I’ll do my best and won’t let you down.”

Regarding Tong Xianglan’s character, Leng Xiaoyao temporarily trusted her because she was recommended by Li Mochen.

Even if she did something wrong, Leng Xiaoyao could easily catch her.

“Okay, then I will arrange a room for you later. Now let’s talk about Uncle Feng. Uncle Feng’s main responsibility is to pick up and drop off my cousins from school. The school is the No.8 Elementary School and Junior High School in Nancheng District. It’s very convenient. Uncle Feng can drive home, which will be more convenient. You can also have weekends off. So the salary will be ten thousand yuan per month. Do you have any objections, Uncle Feng?” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Because Feng Dongcheng’s job was relatively easy, the salary would be much lower, but in his industry, it was considered high with weekends off.

“No objections.” Feng Dongcheng said since he was also satisfied with this salary.

“Only you can drive the car. No one else can borrow it. Of course, if your family needs you to send them somewhere while not affecting your work, it’s okay,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t like it when people used company cars for personal use.

Although Feng Dongcheng was 42 years old, he was still in good physical condition due to being a retired soldier and exercising regularly. He could be both a driver and a bodyguard.

“Sure, boss,” Feng Dongcheng said. He also disliked using company cars for personal use, so he didn’t like borrowing cars from others or lending his own car to others.

“Then it’s Teacher Song and Teacher Lin’s turn. The children finish school at 5:30 pm and have dinner at 6 pm. After dinner, they can start tutoring from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm from Monday to Friday. Dinner will be provided here. Saturdays are from 9 am to 11 am and Sundays are off. You will be paid four hundred yuan per hour each with a transportation allowance of a thousand yuan per month. Do you have any objections?” Leng Xiaoyao said.

With eight hundred yuan per day and excluding four Sundays per month, they could still earn around twenty thousand yuan per month.

On Saturday afternoons and Sundays, they could still take on other tutoring jobs.

For one-on-one tutoring, four hundred yuan per hour wasn’t much, but it also wasn’t little either. The average rate was only three hundred yuan per hour.

Moreover, there was still a transportation allowance of a thousand yuan per month and dinner.

Other families didn’t provide those benefits.
