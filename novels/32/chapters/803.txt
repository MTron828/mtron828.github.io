804 The Zi Family in Southeast Asia

Feng Xueqin wanted to say something, but she couldn’t make a sound after opening her mouth for a while.

“Feng Xueqin, you made me lose my family, and I won’t let you live a good life!” Lu Qiuting said and slapped Feng Xueqin across her face. She hit Feng Xueqin right on her wound, which was extremely painful, and tears welled up in Feng Xueqin’s eyes.

Lu Qiuting enjoyed every second that Feng Xueqin was in pain, so she kept slapping Feng Xueqin’s face right on the wound.

The bandages wrapped around the wounds were dyed red by blood within seconds, and Feng Xueqin almost fainted from the pain. However, she couldn’t shout out loud, so she only whimpered.

Lu Qiuting knew that she couldn’t kill Feng Xueqin right now, so she walked away when she thought that it was enough.

At this moment, Feng Xueqin would rather die.

...

Gu Ning didn’t go to pick Gu Man up tonight, but let her stay in the Tang family’s house. Gu Man still felt a little uneasy, but Tang Yunfan persuaded her to stay with him.

Therefore, only Gu Ning and Qiao Ya were in her house.

When it was 10 pm, Gu Ning finally received Leng Shaoting’s call.

“Shaoting!” Gu Ning greeted him the second she answered his call. She missed him so much.

In fact, they had only been apart for a few days, but they hadn’t contacted each other during that time, so they really missed one another.

Leng Shaoting also ached to see Gu Ning.

“Ningning, I miss you. Do you miss me?” Leng Shaoting asked. Although he already knew the answer, he still wanted to hear it from Gu Ning’s mouth.

“Yes, I do. I’ve been thinking about you all the time,” Gu Ning said.

“I’m coming to City B tomorrow, but I still have to fulfill a task, so I can’t stay by your side the entire time,” Leng Shaoting said. He felt excited to see Gu Ning tomorrow, but was also sad that he couldn’t stay with her.

“It’s fine. I understand.” Gu Ning was very considerate, although she felt disappointed.

They kept chatting on the phone.

After a short while, Gu Ning heard a female voice from the other side of the phone. “Hey, Shaoting, what you are doing alone in the yard?”

Hearing the girl’s voice, Gu Ning was instantly displeased, and Leng Shaoting was a little scared as well. “Ningning, let me explain. The girl is the younger sister of one of my friends. Jinchen, Xin Bei and I just came to my friend’s place to talk about something. They stayed in the room, and I walked out alone, so...”

“I trust you,” Gu Ning said. She trusted Leng Shaoting, and just felt momentarily displeased when she heard the female voice. Gu Ning understood that it was impossible for Leng Shaoting to not meet any other women in his life. She also had many male friends by her sides.

Seeing that Leng Shaoting was talking to someone on the phone, the girl didn’t walk closer, or say another word. She didn’t speak again until Leng Shaoting hung up the phone with Gu Ning. “Shaoting, who were you talking with on the phone?” Her voice was very sweet.

The girl was in her early twenties. She had gorgeous features and nobody could move his eyes away from her face when she showed up. Leng Shaoting, however, knew clearly that this girl had a strong alpha personality under her stunning and delicate face.

“Hi, Miss Zi.” Leng Shaoting didn’t answer her question, but greeted her distantly, then walked towards the living hall.

Zi Beiying didn’t seem upset at all after Leng Shaoting ignored her, because she knew Leng Shaoting’s character very well, and she was already used to it. She followed Leng Shaoting to the living hall.

They were on a foreign island, which was located in Southeast Asia. The place where Leng Shaoting and the others stayed was the Zi family’s house. The Zi family was one of the biggest munitioners in Southeast Asia. Zi Beiying was the daughter of the first wife in the Zi family, so she held a highly important position in her family.

There were three men sitting chatting in the living hall, including Xu Jinchen, Xin Bei and another man of around 30 years old.

Once Leng Shaoting walked in, the man stood up and said, “Let’s go meet my father now.”

He was Zi Shaomin, the son of the first wife in the Zi family, and he was also the heir.

Leng Shaoting and the others followed Zi Shaomin at once, but Zi Beiying stayed behind.

Not only was the Zi family’s house spacious, but it was also closely guarded. Visitors could only move casually in the front yard. If they entered the backyard, they would be shot. The Zi family was involved in munitions, so they never lacked guns and bombs.

After Leng Shaoting, Xu Jinchen, and Xin Bei followed Zi Shaomin to the backyard, they directly stepped into a small building.

There were bodyguards standing on all four of its sides, and no strangers could get inside.

When they arrived at the front of the small building, a middle-aged man walked out at once. He bowed to Zi Shaomin with great respect before he guided them inside.

They entered the small building and went into a room. It was a medical room filled with medical equipment and a bed.

On the bed there was an unconscious man with an oxygen mask on his face. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He was precisely the head of the Zi family, the father of Zi Shaomin and Zi Beiying, but he had been unconscious for a long time till now because of brain damage. Therefore, Zi Shaomin was leading the Zi family now.

Zi Shaomin’s uncle was very ambitious, and always wanted to seize a chance to replace Zi Shaomin, but Zi Shaomin was an outstanding and mature man, so he didn’t give his uncle any ammunition. However, better an open enemy than a false friend. Zi Shaomin had to be cautious all the time, in case he was trapped by his uncle.

The Zi family had a close cooperation with the military of the country Leng Shaoting came from. Zi Shaomin and Leng Shaoting were also close comrades.

As the heir of the Zi family, Zi Shaomin had received professional training when he was just a kid, which was no different from the devilish training that Leng Shaoting had been through, so they had met each other in the Amazon forest many times and had also worked together to fight against enemies.

After Leng Shaoting heard what had happened to the head of the Zi family, he talked with Zi Shaomin on his own initiative. He might be able to cure Zi Shaomin’s father, but there was a condition.
