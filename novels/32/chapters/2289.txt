Chapter 2292: She’s Violent

“You…” The girls were all surprised after they were knocked to the ground. To their surprise, Chu Peihan was very strong and agile.

Was she a kung fu lover?

“I’m very good at kung fu. I can easily beat up a dozen men. You’re merely a bunch of weak girls. I could see that you just wanted to grab my phone. If you had tried to hurt me, I would have beaten you black and blue. If you’re smart, you better leave right now, or I won’t be gentle to you again.” Chu Peihan warned.

“You can’t tell Han Chenglin that I came to see you today,” said the girl with a facial mask. She lost to Chu Peihan, but she still tried to bargain with her. Her pride was really ridiculous.

“Be honest with me. Are you really Han Chenglin’s fiancée?” Chu Peihan asked. She asked that question for no specific reason. She just wanted to make sure of it.

Hearing that, the girl blinked and Chu Peihan had an answer.

“Why do you want to know that? Are you dating Han Chenglin?” The girl bit her lips and looked displeased.

“If you don’t tell me, I’ll directly ask Han Chenglin,” said Chu Peihan and took out her phone again.

“Wait!” The girl stopped her at once.

Chu Peihan stopped and looked at her, waiting for her reply.

The girl hesitated for a second, then said, “I’m not Chenglin’s fiancée, but we’re childhood sweethearts. Both of our families want us to be together, so I’ll marry him sooner or later.”

In the end, the girl even emphasized the close bond between them.

“Don’t worry, Han Chenglin and I are just friends. I won’t tell him that you came to see me today, but please go to talk to him about whatever happens in the future. Don’t come to cause me trouble again, or I won’t be so gentle next time.” Chu Peihan threatened.

The girl said nothing. She only looked at Chu Peihan with displeasure. She wouldn’t be in a good mood after being threatened.

After witnessing Chu Peihan’s abilities, they didn’t dare to stop her. In fact, their whole bodies were in pain now, so they could do nothing.

Chu Peihan told the girl that Han Chenglin and she were just friends. She also agreed that she wouldn’t tell Han Chenglin that she had come to see her, but if they caused her more trouble, Chu Peihan would definitely tell Han Chenglin about it.

The girl didn’t want Han Chenglin to hate her more because of that. Han Chenglin already hated her because she had chased away other girls who tried to form a relationship with him.

She just couldn’t stand it when other girls wouldn’t stay away from Han Chenglin. She couldn’t help teaching them a lesson and telling them not to bother Han Chenglin again.

Han Chenglin was her man, and no one could steal him away from her.

The girl didn’t reply to Chu Peihan, but Chu Peihan didn’t mind. She simply turned around and directly walked away.

She went to Yu Xiaochen and pulled her to leave.

…

“Yunyi, are you alright?”

Once Chu Peihan was gone, the girl’s two friends went to help her get back to her feet.

The girl’s name was Lu Yunyi.

“Can’t you feel it? I’m in great pain all over!” Lu Yunyi was mad. She could barely walk steadily.

“Chu Peihan’s so violent!” Girl A complained.

“She said she was gentle to us today. If we had tried to injure her, we might have been wounded now. It would be very embarrassing,” said Girl B. She believed that Chu Peihan wasn’t lying. “Well, we didn’t collect enough information about her. If we had known she’s so good at fighting, we would have brought two bodyguards and we wouldn’t have been afraid of her.”

“Didn’t she say she can beat up a dozen men by herself? I don’t think two bodyguards are enough, and if we bring too many bodyguards with us, we might be caught by the school,” said Girl A.

“Alright, enough. Let’s go to the hospital now.” Lu Yunyi was displeased when they complimented Chu Peihan, so she snapped at them angrily.

Although she had to admit that Chu Peihan was excellent, Chu Peihan was from a small city, so she didn’t think Chu Peihan’s family could be as influential as hers.

At most, Chu Peihan only had Gu Ning, who was very outstanding, as a best friend, and a greatly-respected teacher, Gu Guangmiao. Without them, Chu Peihan was merely a nobody!

Lu Yunyi was furious.

The two girls shut their mouths at once. They were in pain all over, but they still tolerated the pain and helped Lu Yunyi leave.

…

At this time, Chu Peihan apologized to Yu Xiaochen after they walked away. “Xiaochen, I’m sorry for the trouble.”

Yu Xiaochen felt flattered and immediately replied. “Don’t say that! It’s not your fault. It’s their fault.”

Yu Xiaochen was born in an ordinary family, so she abased herself a little in front of kids from rich families.

Chu Peihan apologized to her because she was innocent, but she somehow felt flattered. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Well, you were threatened by them because of me,” said Chu Peihan in a resigned tone. She knew Yu Xiaochen’s feelings very well, and she had actually encouraged Yu Xiaochen to build confidence many times. Otherwise, she could be easily bullied in the workplace.

Yu Xiaochen had changed slightly, but the change wasn’t big. It took time to change one’s character after all.

Chu Peihan promised Lu Yunyi that she wouldn’t tell Han Chenglin about their meeting today, so she said nothing. She didn’t tell Shi Xiaoyue either, and also reminded Yu Xiaochen to keep it a secret.

Shi Xiaoyue didn’t bother to ask Chu Peihan what she left to do. Since Chu Peihan didn’t tell her, it meant she shouldn’t know.

…

In the afternoon, Leng Shaoting left the capital and went back to the military base, while Gu Ning also went back to school.

Many of Gu Ning’s schoolmates saw her photos with Leng Shaoting, and said that her fiancé was very handsome.

Other than the kids from the four major families, most people didn’t recognize Leng Shaoting. They were guessing who he was.

Some people thought that Leng Shaoting must be from a powerful family, otherwise he didn’t deserve Gu Ning and Gu Ning wouldn’t choose him.

Some people, however, felt that Leng Shaoting might be from an ordinary family. Gu Ning chose him because he was very handsome and she could ignore his family background.

It was a material society and everyone cared more about one’s family background and money than a romantic relationship.
