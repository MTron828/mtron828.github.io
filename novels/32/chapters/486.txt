Chapter 487 Not an Ancient Grave

When Gu Ning walked to where the Yin came from, she surprisingly found that this wasn’t an ancient grave, but was just a 10 square-meter large hole. It was messy inside with broken bodies, bones and rotten clothing of the ancient soldiers. The only thing that had shape was the carriage without horses and wheels.

Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes, and saw a 20-inch mahogany box with some coins and porcelain inside the carriage. Although there weren’t many of them, they were still very valuable.

Gu Ning thought that those ancient soldiers must have been passing by, so why had they suddenly died here? Gu Ning couldn’t figure it out, and the truth wasn’t important either.

Once the night-luminescent pearl appeared, the Yin was gradually absorbed into it. Gu Ning also put the mahogany box into her telepathic eye space before she left. She didn’t stay in the hole for a long time, and walked out after 10 minutes.

Seeing her walking out safely, Jiang Bowen and the others were finally relieved. “Girl Gu, do you know that it’s very dangerous inside? What if there were other zombies in there? Can you handle so many zombies alone?” Jiang Bowen said worriedly.

Gu Ning understood that Jiang Bowen was worried about her safety so she comforted him. “I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you first before I walked in but I’m safe now, and I wouldn’t have walked in there if I hadn’t been confident.”

Since Gu Ning said so, Jiang Bowen didn’t say anything further.

“Oh, there is a pile of bones and broken bodies, but no zombies,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that there were no zombies, everyone relaxed.

“How did you know that there was a zombie?” Jiang Bowen asked Gu Ning.

“I read the news on the Internet. I knew how to kill it, so I came to help,” Gu Ning said.

“We’ve already deleted the news on the Internet, and I hope that you can keep it a secret because it could cause widespread fear,” Jiang Bowen said.

“Of course I will.” Gu Ning knew that it was necessary to keep it a secret. And now that the zombie was burned to ashes and the crisis was resolved the miners were able to go back to work too.

After that, they were about to leave the mountain. Jiang Bowen invited Gu Ning to share a meal with him. Gu Ning declined once, but Jiang Bowen insisted, so she agreed in the end. Anyway, she was starving now, and missed her flight after the mess this afternoon.

Gu Ning wasn’t sure when she would be able to fly back, so she decided to not book a plane ticket yet.

Tong Chengdian and An Wanli also joined Gu Ning and Jiang Bowen for the meal.

Tan Jiangfeng was a famous doctor at the Central Hospital, but he was nobody in front of those important officials. He was also ambitious, and he came here on his own initiative in order to impress those important officials and build his network. Unexpectedly, Gu Ning suddenly appeared and grabbed everyone’s attention away from him. Therefore, Tan Jiangfeng hated Gu Ning a lot but he didn’t dare to say anything. Of course, he wouldn’t give up.

Gu Ning sensed Tan Jiangfeng’s vicious gaze but didn’t care.

Gu Ning got in Jiang Bowen’s car, while Tong Chengdian shared a car with An Wanli.

The other policemen stayed to clean the site. After cleaning the site, the police also left for the Public Security Bureau.

When they had just arrived at the foot of the mountain, many reporters ran to them trying to interview them or take some pictures. However, they were all declined. Since the police refused to accept the interview, the reporters couldn’t do anything about it. They could only take several pictures of the cleaned site, and write the news.

Jiang Bowen chose to dine at Quanlin Resort. After they sat around the table in the private room, Jiang Bowen introduced Tong Chengdian and An Wanli to Gu Ning. Gu Ning greeted them politely with confidence, and her good attitude impressed all of them.

Facing those important figures, Gu Ning didn’t abase herself but stayed calm and confident. After what they had been through, none of them dared despise her.

“Gu Ning, where are you from?” An Wanli asked.

“City F,” Gu Ning said.

“I think that you’re very young; you must still be a student, right?” An Wanli asked.

Gu Ning smiled gently. “Yes, I’m a senior student in high school, and I’m going to attend the entrance examination to college in a few months.”

Everyone around the table was surprised again. They didn’t expect that Gu Ning was just a senior student in a high school and wasn’t in university yet. This young girl was full of surprises!

“You’re indeed a promising young girl!” Tong Chengdian complimented.

Gu Ning smiled but didn’t say anything.

“Gu Ning, are you interested in joining the army?” An Wanli asked with anticipation. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second, then realized An Wanli’s aim. She smiled and apologized. “Sorry, my interest is business.”

Hearing that, An Wanli was disappointed, because Gu Ning was really a potential ace soldier.

Before long, dishes were on the table, and they started to eat.

Gu Ning had rescued a lot of people and killed the zombie, so she was supposed to be awarded, but she declined.

Jiang Bowen really admired Gu Ning because she kept a low profile all the time.
