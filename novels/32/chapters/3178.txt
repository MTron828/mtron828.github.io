3180 Are You Jealous?

Didn’t Li Mochen say that there was nothing special between Leng Xiaoyao and him? Why did Li Mochen question him like that?

However, he didn’t dare to ask Li Mochen that.

The others were surprised by Li Mochen’s question. Although he looked calm, it still shocked them that he sounded a little jealous.

“Brother Mochen, are you jealous?” Leng Xiaoyao asked straightforwardly. She wasn’t serious.

“Not at all. Don’t think too much about it.” Li Mochen denied. He didn’t know whether he was really jealous, but he simply felt unhappy when he heard Si Yiqi’s words.

However, when he denied it, he was afraid that Leng Xiaoyao might feel hurt, so his mind was in a mess.

Leng Xiaoyao turned to Si Yiqi and said, “Mr. Si, aren’t you too sensitive? Brother Mochen asked you casually. Why did you seem as if you did something wrong? The others might think that Brother Mochen is jealous because of your words.”

“Fine, I’m too sensitive.” Si Yiqi smiled with embarrassment, but he didn’t think it was the truth.

Jiang Han and Mu Fan had the same feeling. They had followed Li Mochen’s lead for so many years. Even if they didn’t know him best, they knew him very well. Sometimes, they could know what he wanted them to do at a glance.

Therefore, if Li Mochen didn’t care about it at all, why would he ask Si Yiqi that question? After all, Li Mochen didn’t like jokes.

He wouldn’t joke about other people, but he was fine if other people joked about him. He didn’t like jokes, but it didn’t mean that he was mean.

Li Mochen was unhappy when Leng Xiaoyao said that, but he said nothing else, because it would only make the situation more complicated.

After they went out, they moved the raw jade materials to the small truck. Jiang Han was the truck driver, while Mu Fan was their driver.

They went directly back to the hotel. Then they had a meal and didn’t go back out to pick more raw jade materials.

She would attend the auction tomorrow. Even though it would cost more money, she could make a lot of money. Compared with raw jade materials, few people would be willing to pay a high price at the auction.

Because the raw jade materials were locked in the small truck, they weren’t worried that they might be lost. In addition, there were separate parking rooms in the parking lot of the hotel. The rooms could be locked up. In case any accidents happened, they parked the small truck in a separate parking room, which was safer.

After having a meal, it was still only 8 pm. They had nothing to do, so Si Yiqi proposed drinking tea and chatting in the tea hall. They didn’t want to go back to their rooms so early.

It was too early to sleep. Moreover, they also wanted to see whether Mu Yiyang had any news or needed their help.

It was their team’s task, but Mu Yiyang would turn to Li Mochen for help once he encountered difficulties. Li Mochen never stood on the sidelines.

Li Mochen might not help every time, because they weren’t in the same place most of the time.

As a result, Mu Yiyang and his teammates had to handle it by themselves.

This time, Leng Xiaoyao saw that Lin Mu might encounter trouble, so they were more careful.

If Mu Yiyang and his team didn’t contact Li Mochen, Li Mochen and Si Yiqi wouldn’t contact them either. Whenever Mu Yiyang needed help, he would contact them.

They went to the tea hall and ordered a private room.

Leng Xiaoyao was a girl. However, she climbed up and down the mountain with a group of men, but didn’t feel awkward at all. She wasn’t afraid of rumors either. If anyone dared to judge her because she was with men, it would be his fault because he defamed her.

When they were free, Leng Xiaoyao called Leng Changyuan to set his mind at ease.

Afterwards, she called Shen Xiyin too and asked about her condition.

Shen Xiyin told Leng Xiaoyao about their visit to Shen Yamei’s home today. Although Shen Yamei admitted her fault, her daughter might disagree with her.

Accordingly, to prevent any accidents from happening, they had to be careful.

Shen Xiyin had the same worry because she knew her older cousin well. Her cousin wouldn’t change and even would blame her for it.

After having the call with Shen Xiyin, Leng Xiaoyao took out her laptop to search for something. At the same time, she wanted to know what was going on with Mu Yufan.

It was easy for Leng Xiaoyao to do two things at the same time, so she was able to join Li Mochen and the others’ discussion while she worked on the laptop.

Because they were chatting casually, Leng Xiaoyao could join them. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

They actually wanted to wait till Mu Yiyang was done, but unexpectedly Mu Yiyang really encountered trouble. At about 9:30 pm, Li Mochen received Mu Yiyang’s call.

Mu Yiyang told them that he ran into a very strong person who had strange abilities. Because Leng Xiaoyao was also not an ordinary girl, he wondered whether the person had special skills too.

Two of his teammates were injured, but luckily not seriously.

Lin Mu was directly knocked away by the strong man and fell off a cliff which was ten meters high. Fortunately, he only had abrasions and survived.

Then they found that the talisman that Leng Xiaoyao had given them turned into ashes, so they believed that Leng Xiaoyao’s talisman helped them. Otherwise, Lin Mu should be seriously injured or disabled after being heavily so hit and falling off of a high cliff even if he didn’t die.

In fact, even if Leng Xiaoyao didn’t say that, Li Mochen would ask her to join them. Therefore, once Leng Xiaoyao said that, they agreed.

After that, they immediately left the hotel and headed to Mu Yiyang’s location.

This time, Mu Yiyang and his team came to catch a suspect. However, there was a strong man by the side of the suspect, so they failed and needed Li Mochen’s help.

Their target had run away, but Mu Yiyang and his team chased him. In order not to alert him, they didn’t dare to go closer and decided to wait till Li Mochen and the others came.
