Chapter 1801: What a Shame!

Because there was still a distance, Gu Ning couldn’t see it clearly. She decided to walk closer and have a close look.

Once she moved near to the abandoned yard, Gu Ning felt the Yin coming from the bottom of the well.

Gu Ning walked inside, but she didn’t have time to figure out why there were skeletons under the well. What she needed to deal with right now was the cultivator.

“Get out now! You’ve been following me for days, but haven’t had a chance to attack me yet. It must be difficult for you,” said Gu Ning with mockery before the cultivator showed himself.

Anyway, she was going to face him, so there was no need for her to wait for him to show up of his own accord. Besides, if she could take the initiative and say that aloud, she would look strong. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The cultivator who hid himself was taken aback. He wondered whether Gu Ning was talking to him. He couldn’t believe a mortal was able to discover him.

However, Gu Ning said that she knew he had been following her for days, which was the truth. Only he had been following her during these days. There was no one else who did that.

How did she discover him?

“Hey, the man behind the wall five meters away from me. I’m talking to you. Get out now. You’ve damaged my car. We should deal with it first!” Seeing that the cultivator hesitated to walk out, Gu Ning understood what he was thinking.

At this time, without doubt, the cultivator was sure that Gu Ning was talking with him. He was shocked in an instant, because it turned out she knew everything.

In that case, she must have recognized him at Qianling Mountain last time.

If so, that Gu Ning knew Baili Zongyang and his younger sister could be...

The cultivator had many questions in his mind, but he had to ask Gu Ning for the answers.

Although he was astonished by the fact that Gu Ning had already discovered him a long time ago, he wasn’t afraid of her. Even if she was capable, she was just a mortal and was no match for him.

Therefore, the cultivator walked out and into the yard, staring at Gu Ning. He asked without delay, “How did you find out that I’ve damaged your car? How did you know I’ve been following you these days?”

“My car door was damaged, so of course I should search for evidence by watching the surveillance videos. Is it strange? I noticed that you appeared around me once in a while. I don’t think it’s just a coincidence! By the way, I was born with acute senses, so I’m able to feel it when I’ve been followed for such a long time. For my own safety, I naturally should pay more attention to the surveillance cameras. I bet you must have found out my identity, right? Then you should know it’s not difficult for me to watch any surveillance videos if I want,” said Gu Ning. It was a total lie, because she had no intention of exposing her secret.

Hearing that, the cultivator frowned. Gu Ning’s words made sense, but he didn’t believe all of them.

“Do you mean you deliberately led me here?” asked the cultivator.

“Otherwise why would I come here? I’m not fooling around every day. I don’t visit here for fun,” said Gu Ning and her tone was full of mockery towards the cultivator.

“Aren’t you afraid I’ll hurt you?” The cultivator stared at Gu Ning.

“Since you’ve found information about me, you should know I’m not weak at all. Quite the opposite, I’m quite good at kung fu. Why should I be afraid of you? Even if I can’t defeat you, can’t I escape?” said Gu Ning and looked down her nose at the cultivator.

She purposely did that to make the cultivator believe she knew nothing about his abilities. In that case, the cultivator would take her more lightly.

She succeeded. The cultivator indeed felt Gu Ning was arrogant and stupid, so he took her even more lightly. He was a cultivator after all, so it couldn’t be easier for him to deal with a mortal.

Nevertheless, the cultivator was unwilling to use violence for the time being. Instead, he decided to politely talk with Gu Ning. If they could solve the problem peacefully, there was no need to have a fight.

“I’m sorry for damaging your car. I’m willing to pay for it,” said the cultivator.

“That’ll be for the best,” said Gu Ning feigning surprise on the surface. She actually wasn’t surprised, and knew what the cultivator planned to do.

“Even though you have only damaged the lock, my car isn’t cheap at all. It cost over ten thousand yuan to fix the lock, so you can give me ten thousand yuan for it. Do you want to transfer the money with your phone or pay in cash?” asked Gu Ning.

“Before I pay it, I also have the interest in talking about a deal with you,” said the cultivator. He didn’t care about the money at all, as long as he was able to buy the Jade with Dragon Phoenix Cloud Pattern from Gu Ning.

The jade itself was worth thirty million yuan after all.

“Oh, what is it?” asked Gu Ning, although she already knew the answer.

The cultivator was quite straightforward and he said, “Can you sell me the Jade with Dragon Phoenix Cloud Pattern you bought from the Palace Museum? It’s my family heirloom, but was stolen away by a gravedigger. I’ve searched for it for a long time till I finally found it. I tried to figure out a way to buy it, but unexpectedly you did it before me. If you’re willing to sell it to me, I can give you ten million yuan more than the money you’ve paid for it.”

It was a lie too, and he said that simply to win Gu Ning’s sympathy.

“Oh, you want the Jade with Dragon Phoenix Cloud Pattern? What a shame! I bought it for another person. I already gave it to the person after buying it,” said Gu Ning, seeming sorry.

“What?” The cultivator was stunned, and he thought of Baili Zongyang and his younger sister right away, because only cultivators could see the secret of the jade.

It was also possible that it was bought and collected by an antique lover.

No matter what, only Gu Ning knew who the person was. “Who told you to buy it?” asked the cultivator.

At this moment, the cultivator didn’t think much about Gu Ning’s reply or doubt whether it was true.

“I actually don’t know the person. The person just knows that I have connections in the Palace Museum, so I was given ten million yuan to buy the jade. It’s a super easy task, so I agreed. It’s just an antique anyway,” said Gu Ning. She was implying that she knew very little about the Jade with Dragon Phoenix Cloud Pattern.
