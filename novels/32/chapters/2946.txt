2949 Leng Xiaoyao, How Dare You Use Violence?

“But I can’t let you go with all the slanders and bullying. You must pay for what you’ve done to me!” Leng Xiaoyao said. The next moment, she directly beat all of them, including Jiang Yihan.

Jiang Yihan had teamed up with Leng Yuqi and Chu Jianan many times to bully her before.

She slapped and kicked them. Although she didn’t use much strength, she wasn’t gentle either. After a few seconds, they had all fallen to the ground.

They were shocked and were in a lot of pain.

They couldn’t believe that Leng Xiaoyao dared to use violence and that she could easily beat all of them. They could barely fight back.

Although Leng Xiaoyao was normally arrogant, she was always weak. As long as Leng Yuqi and Chu Jiayu teamed up, they could easily beat Leng Xiaoyao.

Anyway, once Leng Xiaoyao used violence, she suddenly found that her abilities were restricted. She clearly felt that she was at a low level.

Although it upset Leng Xiaoyao, it was better than nothing. She would try to get back to her real level later, otherwise it would be difficult for her to do what she wanted to do next.

Only when she was powerful enough would she not be afraid of anyone.

Luckily, her current level was enough to defeat ordinary people, so she wasn’t anxious just because her abilities were restricted.

“Leng Xiaoyao, how dare you use violence?” Chu Jianan glared at Leng Xiaoyao and questioned her. At this moment, he couldn’t wait to tear her into pieces.

How dared Leng Xiaoyao beat him?

“I already did. Why do you still say something like that? Are you an idiot? If you don’t want to accept it, stand up and fight me.” Leng Xiaoyao looked down her nose at Chu Jianan, and challenged him.

In the past, she was just a paper tiger that wasn’t really strong, but now she was a real tiger.

“You…” Chu Jianan wanted to punch Leng Xiaoyao, but Leng Xiaoyao easily beat them all, so he didn’t dare to move.

And he could hardly get back to his feet after being kicked so heavily.

“Leng Xiaoyao, you, you…” Chu Jiayu cried out in pain. She was a spoiled rich girl, and had never been treated like this before.

Leng Yuqi and Jiang Yihan also cried in pain, but weren’t as loud as Chu Jiayu.

They didn’t want to ruin their image.

“Stop talking. If you want to fight back, do it now!” Leng Xiaoyao provoked her.

“I’ll make you pay for this!” Chu Jiayu couldn’t get up now, but she wouldn’t let Leng Xiaoyao get away with it.

“Do whatever you can,” Leng Xiaoyao scoffed. She wasn’t afraid of Chu Jiayu causing her trouble.

Since they couldn’t do anything to her right now, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to waste time on them. She directly turned around and walked away, leaving them behind.

Now it was time to introduce Leng Xiaoyao’s background in this incarnation. Her father was a soldier with a high rank, but he was sacrificed in a task.

The Leng family was a powerful family in a second-tier city, City Chang. They weren’t the most powerful family, but they weren’t weak. Leng Xiaoyao’s grandfather used to be the deputy mayor of City Chang.

Although her grandfather had retired long ago, his connections were still useful.

Leng Xiaoyao’s uncle, Leng Yehua, who was also Leng Yuqi’s father, was a deputy director.

Leng Xiaoyao’s father was her grandfather’s second son, and joined the army.

Leng Xiaoyao’s third uncle, Leng Yecheng, took over her father’s business.

Yes, her uncle took over the business left by her mother.

Leng Xiaoyao’s mother was an orphan, but had outstanding abilities. She founded a company on her own. Although it wasn’t large, it had dozens of millions of yuan in assets.

Now it was being managed by Leng Xiaoyao’s third uncle and it had over a hundred million yuan in assets.

Although it was barely anything in City Chang, it was owned by the Leng family, so it was different.

Only Master Leng and Leng Xiaoyao’s third uncle treated her well in the Leng family. She had become arrogant because she was spoiled by them, but Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t unreasonable, and she only acted against those who annoyed her.

Therefore, Master Leng and Leng Yecheng didn’t hate her.

Besides, Leng Xiaoyao completely changed after her parents passed away, so they needed to take care of her. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

In fact, Leng Xiaoyao was simply straightforward, but sometimes it wasn’t welcome.

On the other hand, her first uncle didn’t like her very much because he wanted to steal the properties left by Leng Xiaoyao’s mother and also wanted Leng Yuqi to replace her to marry into the Chu family.

Although none of the Chu family had power, they were a well-known, rich family in City Chang with billions of yuan in assets.

…

Chu Jianan and the others were furous, but they could do nothing about it. However, once Leng Xiaoyao was gone, they reported it to the Leng family and the Chu family.

After knowing that Leng Xiaoyao had beaten them, both the Leng family and the Chu family were surprised. They couldn’t believe it, and felt that it must be Chu Jianan’s idea to get Leng Xiaoyao punished.

Leng Xiaoyao was simply a paper tiger in their eyes. She could barely cause a scene so it was impossible for her alone to beat four of them. Normally, the four of them would team up to beat Leng Xiaoyao.

Anyway, since they said they were beaten by Leng Xiaoyao, they had to ask her about that.

However, the Leng family ought to do that first.

Master Leng was surprised when he heard the news, but he was happy the next moment. He really hoped that Leng Xiaoyao did that, because it proved that Leng Xiaoyao had some skill and that she had begun to hate Chu Jianan.

To be honest, Master Leng didn’t like Chu Jianan at all. Although he was handsome and had some abilities, he had a very bad character.

He already had an engagement with Leng Xiaoyao, but still fell in love with Leng Yuqi. It was fine, because it was hard to control love sometimes, but he didn’t keep his distance from Leng Yuqi even after being engaged with Leng Xiaoyao.

Master Leng disliked Leng Yuqi as well. Even though Leng Yuqi looked considerate and smart, given what she had done was enough to prove that she had no moral standards.
