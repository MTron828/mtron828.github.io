Chapter 2040: Their Relationship Can’t Be Common

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“It’s amazing! Lord Leng of the Leng family also came in person!”

“I heard Gu Ning has a relationship with Master Leng.”

“In that case, Gu Ning’s relationship with the Leng family can’t be common.”

Because not everyone knew that Gu Ning had a relationship with Master Leng, they were shocked to see Leng Shaoting, but they soon accepted it after hearing that.

However, they were still stunned by the fact that Gu Ning could have a relationship with Master Leng.

“Look at the badge on Lord Leng’s clothing. He’s a major general!”

“What? Major general? No way! He’s too young.”

Because most guests weren’t members of high society, they knew little about Leng Shaoting and were quite amazed by his rank of major general in the military.

“Jesus, it’s so unbelievable.”

“…”

It was not only Leng Shaoting; Leng Shaoxun and Leng Shaoxi also came. They didn’t show up along with Leng Shaoting, but quietly appeared by Gu Ning’s side.

Xu Qinyin, Chu Peihan, Song Miaoge and the others stood next to Gu Ning, while Tang Qingyang went to talk with those successful businessmen.

It was the first time that Song Miaoge had seen Leng Shaoting. She had only heard of him before. Although she had seen Leng Shaoting ages ago when she was little, she could barely remember his face.

She used to admire Rong Jue, but now she found Leng Shaoting much more attractive than Rong Jue.

Leng Shaoting was more handsome and enjoyed a higher rank than Rong Jue.

She only took Leng Shaoting as her idol, and wouldn’t have any evil thoughts about him because she knew he was her close friend’s boyfriend. In addition, she was clearly aware that such a quality man as Leng Shaoting wouldn’t bother to pay much attention to her.

“Is this Gu Ning’s fiancé?” Zhang Zikai asked Song Miaoge with excitement. She knew that Gu Ning’s fiancé was Leng Shaoting, but had never seen Leng Shaoting before, so she wanted to make sure of it.

“Yeah,” said Song Miaoge.

“He’s so handsome. He’s even better-looking than those stars,” said Zhang Zikai in amazement.

Actually, Leng Shaoting shouldn’t come to such an event because those cultivators who spied on Gu Ning would certainly appear. Even if they didn’t show up, Baili Zongyang and his younger sister were there and they would notice him.

Nevertheless, no cultivator could sense any air of a cultivator from Leng Shaoting’s body, so those cultivators who followed Gu Ning failed to find out that Leng Shaoting was a cultivator as well.

Before Leng Shaoting came here, he got a magical pill from Shangguan Yang to hide the air of a cultivator, but it was only useful for an hour, so he had to leave before its effect was gone.

Leng Shaoting arrived at 9:30 am and the ceremony would be over at 10:30 am, so he had enough time to attend the news conference of the Shengning Organization.

Several cultivators came, but they didn’t dare come near because of Baili Zongyang.

They knew that they wouldn’t get anything they wanted even if they watched Gu Ning all day long today, so they left after a while.

Sometimes, they honestly had no idea why they had to spy on Gu Ning because they had found nothing useful even after a long time.

Nevertheless, it was their patriarch’s order, so they had to obey it.

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning’s relationship was kept a secret, so they didn’t interact with each other very intimately. Leng Shaoting simply stood behind Gu Ning at an appropriate distance. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Shortly after Leng Shaoting came, both the Shengshi Organization and the Jinlin Organization sent their people over.

The representative of the Shengshi Organization was its president’s secretary, while the representative of the Jinlin Organization was Xu Jinlin. Many people were aware of Gu Ning’s relationship with the two large business groups because they had sent people to congratulate Gu Ning on the opening of her companies. However, people were still amazed by the importance of their representatives.

“Well, it seems Gu Ning indeed has a very close relationship with the Shengshi Organization and the Jinlin Organization. I’ve heard about it before, but never had the chance to see it, so I couldn’t believe it. Now that I witnessed it with my own eyes. I can’t doubt it.”

It was true that a lot of people had heard of it, but hadn’t witnessed it with their own eyes. They didn’t feel it was real till now. Some actually still couldn’t believe it because it was too unbelievable.

Before they could get back to their senses, something even more shocking happened.

The patriarch of the Tang family and the chairman of the Tanghuang Organization, came.

It was even more shocking than the presence of Leng Shaoting and Xu Jinlin because Tang Haifeng was the Tang family’s patriarch and Tang Yunfan was the chairman of the Tanghuang Organization. They came in person, so it meant a lot.

In fact, Master Leng wanted to come as well, but Leng Shaoting stopped him because he didn’t think it was appropriate.

Master Xu and Jiang Zhongyu would come, but they hadn’t shown up yet.

“OMG, both Master Tang of the Tang family and Chairman Tang of the Tanghuang Organization came. I’m curious about Gu Ning’s relationship with the Tang family now!”

“Their relationship can’t be common. She must have a closer relationship with them than the Leng family and the Xu family.”

“Gu Ning is so unbelievable. How does she manage to know so many powerful figures?”

“No wonder she’s able to build her business empire smoothly.”

“Hey, didn’t you notice that Gu Ning resembles Lord Tang?”

“I didn’t realize it until you said that!”

“Is Gu Ning Lord Tang’s illegitimate daughter?”

Because it wasn’t a secret in the business circle that Tang Yunfan stayed unmarried for years, many people were aware of that.

He refused to get married, so he definitely had no children except for illegitimate ones. Moreover, if Gu Ning was his daughter, why was her surname Gu instead of Tang? As a result, they guessed that Gu Ning could be Tang Yunfan’s illegitimate daughter.

Only a few people noticed that Gu Ning resembled Tang Yunfan, but they actually knew little about Tang Yunfan.

“I think it’s possible.”

“Come on, they just look alike. It doesn’t mean they’re related to each other. There are a lot of people who resemble each other in this world.”

“No matter what, Gu Ning’s relationship with the Tang family must be very special.”

“…”

“Hi, grandpa, dad,” Gu Ning called them, but her voice wasn’t loud, so not many people heard it and those who heard it were aware of Gu Ning’s real relationship with the Tang family.

“Congratulations, Ningning! We’re all proud of you.”

Tang Haifeng was filled with happiness and pride.

Many guests heard their talk, but didn’t think further about it because people who were close to each other often said that.

After a while, Cao Wenxin came on behalf of the Cao family.
