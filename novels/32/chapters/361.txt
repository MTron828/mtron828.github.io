“Not yet,” Gu Ning replied, then turned to Yu Mixi’s uncles and aunt. “Since your name isn’t on the Premises Permit, this house has nothing to do with you. It’s called laws. And if you want to take it through force, we’ll call the police.”

Actually, Yu Mixi’s uncles and aunts knew that their names weren’t on the Premises Permit of this house, but they were very eager to get the money. And they were so used to bullying Yu Mixi’s family, so they tried to act against the laws.

Knowing that Gu Ning wasn’t simple and that she was really going to call the police, Yu Mixi’s uncles and aunts hesitated. Besides, they couldn’t beat Gu Ning and the others in a fight, so they left reluctantly in the end.

“Miss Gu, since they are gone, I think that we...” Yu Mixi’s father opened his mouth. He hoped that Gu Ning would take back what she had just said.

“Uncle Yu, they only left because they were scared of us, but it doesn’t mean that they will give up. I think that they will probably come back again, so please don’t argue with me over the house. Let’s settle it as soon as possible,” Gu Ning said.

Indeed, they were just scared of Gu Ning and the others, which didn’t mean that they would give up. Greedy people like them wouldn’t give up until they were forced to do so.

“Exactly! Uncle Yu, please listen to our boss this time!” Hao Ran and the others persuaded Yu Mixi’s father.

After hesitating for a while, Yu Mixi’s father agreed in the end. He now really didn’t know how to thank you Gu Ning enough.

“However, the new houses aren’t on sale yet. We need to wait for a month. You can continue living in this old house. If the house is handed over to the government, you can rent a place. Once the new house is ready, you can move in. If they dare to cause you trouble again don’t hesitate to call the police. I’ll come to sign the contract with you tomorrow,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure,” Yu Mixi’s father answered.

After that, Gu Ning and Yu Mixi went out with their friends for a reunion. Yu Mixi’s parents invited them to eat at home to thank them for what they had done, but was declined by Gu Ning. Yu Mixi’s parents understood that teenagers preferred to gather with their peers.

“Boss, why did you say that you’re Mixi’s boss? Tell us about it!” The moment that they left Yu Mixi’s home, Chu Peihan asked without delay.

“Exactly! What happened?” Hao Ran and the others all looked to Gu Ning with curiosity.

“I’m going to run my own company, and I need skilled workers. Mixi is good at math and she plans to study financial management, so I hired her beforehand,” Gu Ning explained.

It wasn’t news that Gu Ning was going to run her company, so it wasn’t shocking.

“Boss, what kind of company are you going to establish?” Hao Ran asked.

“I feel like you’re always busy since I’ve met you,” Qin Zixun said.

“Exactly!” Chu Peihan echoed. “And you’re always mysterious. Nobody can find you.”

“Jade jewelry,” Gu Ning replied.

“Jade jewelry? Have you established your company yet?” Mu Ke asked, because he was involved in the jewelry industry too, and he was interested in it.

“Yes, I have. Jade Beauty Jewelry in City G is my brand actually,” Gu Ning said. She didn’t hide the truth any longer. “What? Jade Beauty Jewelry!” Hearing that, everyone rounded their eyes in shock. Jade Beauty Jewelry was very famous recently and the brand was their boss’s!

Although they all knew that Gu Ning wasn’t simple and that she was destined to build her business empire. Unexpectedly, Gu Ning’s very first company was already very successful!

“OMG! Boss, you are really awesome! I feel like I’m having a heart attack.” Hao Ran covered his chest with one hand, like he was really astonished.

“Boss, you must be super-rich! Jade Beauty Jewelry is worth at least several billion yuan!” Mu Ke said with admiration. Although Jade Beauty Jewelry only had one flagship store now, it was a high-end jewelry brand. The value of its assets was extremely high.

“Boss...”

Each of them was full of interest and discussed with excitement.

“Boss, how did you do it? Please tell us details, so that we can learn from you!” Mu Ke’s eyes lit up and begged for Gu Ning’s useful skills.

“Please!” The others all echoed.

Mu Ke was really curious about the secret of Gu Ning’s success, while the others were simply curious.

Gu Ning smiled and said, “Do you still remember that I told you that I cut out jade by stone gambling? I went to play stone gambling later again and used the jade which I cut out to open a store.”

“No way! Boss, you’re so unbelievable! Everyone knows how hard it is to cut out a single piece of jade, but you are able to run a jade store just by stone gambling?” Mu Ke was quite surprised.

“Boss, do you have Jade Eyes?” Hao Ran joked. Although the others all had the same idea, none of them believed it. Unfortunately, it was the truth.

“Alright, stop conjecturing. And keep it a secret among us. Don’t say a word to your families,” Gu Ning warned.

“We won’t!” everyone promised.

“Boss since you’re so rich now, we should have a luxury meal today! Come on, let’s go dine in a five-star hotel before we have fun in Dihao Clubhouse!” Qin Zixun said.

“Agreed!” the others said with one accord.

“I’ll call to make the reservation in Dihao Clubhouse, but is it possible that our boss will win the top prize again?” Chu Peihan said. Thinking of Gu Ning’s incredible luck last time, Chu Peihan had the strange feeling that Gu Ning was going to win the top prize again this time.

“I would love to see boss win the top prize again, but it isn’t very likely for it to happen the second time. Unless boss does have Jade Eyes and is able to see which one in the box is the top prize,” Hao Ran said.

Although they didn’t believe in Jade Eyes at all, Gu Ning panicked a little when they kept talking about it. Thus she decided to not win the top prize this time.

“Alright, let’s go dine together now! Which hotel?” Gu Ning immediately changed the topic.

“Let’s go to Shengyuan Hotel! It’s close to Dihao Clubhouse,” Chu Peihan proposed. Afterwards, a group of them took taxis heading towards Shengyuan Hotel.

Coincidentally, Gu Qinxiang also invited his client to have a meal together at Shengyuan Hotel. His client was an executive of a famous company. A hotel under the company’s name needed decorating, and Gu Qinxiang was eager to strike the deal. Thus in order to show his ability and willingness; he waited for the executive in person at the entrance of the hotel. If he could strike the deal today, it would be a big deal of nearly five million yuan.

Gu Qinxiang only had fifty million yuan in assets, so five million yuan was a lot in his eyes.

His company’s profits were rapidly decreasing, and he was running out of capital now. It was possible that he would lose money too. If he failed to settle this big deal today, his company would barely stay afloat. Therefore, Gu Qinxiang took today’s meeting very seriously.

When it was almost 6 pm, Gu Qinxiang’s client arrived. The executive’s name was Quan Wenfeng, and he came along with his secretary and a friend.
