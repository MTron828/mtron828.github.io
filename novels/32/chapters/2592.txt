Chapter 2593: Solve the Underlying Problem

In the private room, they finished giving their order. After the waiter left, Kang Shaojie thanked Gu Ning. “Miss Gu, thank you so much for your help today! If it hadn’t been for you, it would have been impossible for me to win. If I lost, it would be serious trouble.”

“No need to thank me, Mr. Kang. It was a deal. I’m not just helping you,” said Gu Ning. Although it was a small favor that Kang Shaojie did for her by helping her deal with the Bureau of Land and Resources, it was Gu Ning’s idea, so she thought it was fair.

“Miss Gu, I’ll never forget what you’ve done for me. Whatever you need in the future, feel free to let me know,” said Kang Shaojie. After that, he stopped thanking her, otherwise it would be uncomfortable.

“Sure.” Gu Ning didn’t bother to talk about it further. She was going to start a business in City Rui after all, so she would need the Kang family one day. However, at the moment the Kang family was in a dangerous situation. “Um, although you won today, I don’t think your uncle will give up. You must be careful.”

Hearing that, Kang Shaojie was a little embarrassed.

It was true that Kang Yuannan wouldn’t stop making things difficult for him even though he won today. Even after he became the new chairman, his uncle would continue to cause him trouble.

“So I think the best solution is to solve the underlying problem,” said Gu Ning.

“Solve the underlying problem? How?” asked Kang Shaojie. He didn’t fully understand Gu Ning’s meaning.

“They don’t listen to you, but they’ll obey your father, so I think you should bring your father back to the company,” said Gu Ning.

Kang Shaojie frowned. “My father is in a bad condition now. He can barely take care of himself, let alone work.”

If his father weren’t seriously sick, Kang Yuannan wouldn’t have dared to steal his seat.

“Would you please tell me what your father’s illness is?” asked Gu Ning. No matter what the illness was, she could treat it, but she still needed to ask about it first.

Speaking of Kang Yuanbo’s illness, Kang Shaojie gave a heavy sign and looked upset at once. “My father is suffering from coronary heart disease, which is quite serious. Although he’s been receiving treatment, he isn’t getting better, that’s why my second uncle wants to steal power.”

“Would you believe me if I tell you I can heal him?” said Gu Ning seriously.

“What?” Hearing that, Kang Shaojie was shocked. He could barely believe it.

Gu Ning could heal his father? Really?

It was not Kang Shaojie’s fault that he didn’t believe it. After all, the disease couldn’t really be cured and his father didn’t get better even after being treated for so long. That’s why he had lost hope.

Gu Ning didn’t rush to explain it and waited for Kang Shaojie’s reply.

“Miss Gu, do you mean that you can heal my father? Really?” asked Kang Shaojie. He was full of excitement and anticipation, so his voice trembled a little.

“Yeah, why would I lie to you?” said Gu Ning.

“Well, if it’s possible, please treat my father. No matter how much it costs, I can pay you…” Kang Shaojie couldn’t believe it, but he thought that his family could only give it a try.

“My medicine is indeed a little expensive, but you can totally afford it. It’s far less than a hundred million yuan, but I’ll still ask you for the medical fee,” said Gu Ning. Then she took out a porcelain bottle with three power crystals inside. “There are three pills. Each costs a million yuan. Take a pill every three days. After taking all three pills, your father should be mostly recovered. With careful care for a few days, I think he will be much better. I can’t promise that he’ll make a full recovery, but I’m sure he won’t be as sick again. He will be able to live a normal life in the future.”

Hearing Gu Ning’s words, Kang Shaojie was stunned.

He wasn’t amazed by the price of the pill, he was just shocked by its effect. It was unbelievable that the pill could heal his father’s coronary heart disease!

No matter what, he still wanted to give it a try. Even if it was useless, he believed that Gu Ning wouldn’t harm his father.

“Miss Gu, to be honest. It’s very unbelievable for me. I can’t accept or believe it yet, but I want to give it a try,” said Kang Shaojie. He didn’t hide his worries.

“I know it’s too amazing, making it hard to believe, but if you have courage, you can try it right now. However, you will also need to pay for an extra pill,” said Gu Ning.

“Try it now? How? I’m not sick,” said Kang Shaojie.

“Are there any scars on your body?” asked Gu Ning.

“I do have a scar. I went to a raw jade material mountain a few years ago, and I fell down it in an accident. There was a long cut on my shoulder. Now it’s an obvious scar,” said Kang Shaojie.

“You can directly take this pill or apply it to your scar. It’s very effective in both ways,” said Gu Ning. Then she took out another porcelain bottle. There was only one power crystal in it. “There is a pill inside. Add some water and you can apply it to your scar. If you’re willing to give it a try, you can try it now.”

“No problem, I’ll try it now.” Kang Shaojie didn’t hesitate to have a try. If he directly gave the medicine to his father, he might be worried, but he wouldn’t hesitate to personally try it now.

When Kang Shaojie agreed, Gu Ning poured some water into the bottle before handing it to him. “Try it. Apply the medicine to your scar.”

“Thanks,” said Kang Shaojie and took the bottle Gu Ning handed to him. Then he walked to the washroom.

Although the scar was only on his shoulder, Kang Shaojie still avoided them. It showed his respect for them.

In the washroom, Kang Shaojie took off his coat and pulled off the clothing on his right shoulder. There was a finger long, wide scar, which he immediately applied some medicine liquid to.

Once the medicine touched his skin, he felt a sudden coldness which went straight into his body.

Kang Shaojie didn’t pay much attention to it. He thought that it wouldn’t come into effect so quickly, so he walked out right after he finished. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Afterwards, the dishes were placed on the table and they began to enjoy the meal.

While they were having a meal, Mr. Meng and Mr. Chen went back to their own homes and spoke to their fathers about what happened today.
