Leng Shaoting didn’t look tired at all when he got back home this time, because he had taken the power crystals that Gu Ning gave him. Once he was back, he hugged Gu Ning tightly in his arms, as they stood in silence.“Have you eaten?” Gu Ning asked later.

“Not yet,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Let me cook for you,” Gu Ning said.

“Great.” He was always happy to watch his beloved girl cooking for him. “A bowl of noodles will be fine.”

“No problem, go have a shower first,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure,” Leng Shaoting said then walked into the bathroom.

When he came back after taking the shower, the noodles were already down and Gu Ning placed the bowl on the dining table.

Leng Shaoting sat down at once and enjoyed his simple dinner.

After having dinner, Leng Shaoting said to Gu Ning with a serious face, “Ningning, I need your help.”

Gu Ning was surprised and asked, “What happened?”

“We had field training at the training base not long ago, but three soldiers inexplicably went missing. Although there are surveillance cameras in the woods, the woods are too large to be monitored completely, so the three soldiers are nowhere to be found now. I think it probably has something to do with monsters or ghosts. I didn’t report it to the military leaders, because they wouldn’t believe it, and it wasn’t determined yet. I only learned about monsters and ghosts after you became my girlfriend. You know a lot more about them than we do, and you also have a pair of Jade Eyes, so it should be much easier for you to find some clues. Can you help me deal with it?” Leng Shaoting said.

Leng Shaoting honestly didn’t know what else he could do, so he had to turn to Gu Ning for help.

Hearing that, Gu Ning’s expression also became serious. She agreed with Leng Shaoting that it might have something to do with monsters or ghosts. Since Leng Shaoting needed her help now, Gu Ning definitely wouldn’t turn him down. Even if Leng Shaoting didn’t need her help, she would still do something once she learned about this terrible news.

“Of course I can help. When should we go there?” Gu Ning asked.

“The sooner, the better. We can go there right away,” Leng Shaoting said.

Gu Ning nodded, and they left the house together without delay.

The training base of the military was located deep in the mountains, so it was far from the city center.

On their way, Gu Ning received Zi Beiying’s call and Zi Beiying invited her to hang out together, but because Gu Ning wasn’t free, she told Zi Beiying to call Xu Qinyin.

...

Xia Maiqi was busy with work that night, so Zi Beiying felt a little lonely. It was still early, so Zi Beiying wanted to hang out.

Even though Mengda and Nan stayed with her all day, she still felt bored hanging out with them all the time.

Hearing Gu Ning’s advice, Zi Beiying thought that it was a good idea and called Xu Qinyin afterwards.

They got along well with each other. In addition, Xu Qinyin was Gu Ning’s friend and Xu Jinchen’s younger cousin, so Zi Beiying felt somewhat familiar with Xu Qinyin.

Actually, because of Zi Beiying’s special family background, she couldn’t make as many friends as she wanted. She didn’t have many friends, but her friends were all very close to her.

Zi Beiying also tended to keep her family background a secret from others, Gu Ning was included. Even if Leng Shaoting might have told Gu Ning something about her family, she wouldn’t talk about it with Gu Ning of her own accord.

...

At this time, Xu Qinyin felt a little lonely and bored at home too. Gu Anna wasn’t in the capital, and she didn’t want to hang out with her other friends. All of a sudden, she received Zi Beiying’s call, which cheered her up.

Xu Qinyin had a good impression of Zi Beiying, so she agreed at once. She asked Zi Beiying to go with her to meet Xu Jinchen.

Zi Beiying felt slightly excited when she heard that they would have fun with Xu Jinchen tonight. When Zi Beiying arrived at the appointed clubhouse, she saw Xu Qinyin and Xu Jinchen.

“Hi, I have a piece of terrible news to tell you. I ran into the woman named Wu Mina today. She tried to pour a pot of hot soup over me, but Mengda caught her and kicked the pot causing her to pour the hot soup over herself. She was scalded,” Zi Beiying said to Xu Jinchen.

Knowing that, Xu Jinchen was displeased. To his astonishment, Wu Mina ignored his warning. Although Zi Beiying was fine, he still felt a little guilty.

“I’m so sorry to hear it,” Xu Jinchen said. “I’ll warn the Wu family to stop her harassing you.”

“Thanks, but I don’t care about her actually. She is a weak woman and no match for me,” Zi Beiying said.

“Beiying, what do you think of Jinchen? Isn’t he a very good man?” Xu Qinyin suddenly asked.

Hearing that, both Zi Beiying and Xu Jinchen were struck dumb for a second. Xu Jinchen flushed a little and stopped Xu Qinyin at once. “Qinyin, what are you talking about?”

“What? I think you two could be a great couple,” Xu Qinyin said.

Although she didn’t know much about Zi Beiying’s family background, the Xu family didn’t care much about it anyway. Moreover, she thought that Zi Beiying and Xu Jinchen were very familiar with each other.
