Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Because the group of men didn’t take them seriously, they were ill-prepared when Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue dashed to beat them. They even planned to laugh at them.

However, before they could say anything, Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue used great strength to attack them and successfully grabbed two iron rods from two men.

The two men were shocked and tried to struggle, but they were only amazed by Gu Ning’s and Baili Zongxue’s unbelievable strength. As a result, they turned to fight against them.

Unfortunately, before they could hurt Gu Ning or Baili Zongxue, Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue took action first. Without delay, Gu Ning kicked a man’s crotch, while Baili Zongxue threw the other man over her shoulder.

Within seconds, two 1.8m tall, strong men were beaten by two 1.65m tall, seemingly weak girls. Their iron rods were also taken away.

This scene shocked the other six men and several passers-by. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue couldn’t care less about their reaction. Right after they beat the two men, they continued to attack the other men.

Gu Ning was furious, so she used great strength to beat them. She only made sure that she wouldn’t kill them. She didn’t care whether they would be disabled.

After all, this group of men was digging their own graves by attacking her people.

Witnessing Gu Ning’s and Baili Zongxue’s skills, the rest of the men began to fight against them together.

Unexpectedly, the two young girls weren’t at a disadvantage at all when facing six strong men. Instead, they easily got control of the situation and the six men all screamed in pain. They couldn’t even touch the girls’ clothes and were beaten by them from the beginning to the end.

Gu Ning had the intention of torturing them, so she didn’t disable them right away. Instead, she beat them slowly, enjoying the process.

“Ha-ha,” K snorted with laughter in the car. “Chen, shouldn’t we practice our fighting skills? We can’t turn to our boss for help every time. If she wasn’t in the capital or was too far from us, we could have lost our lives today.”

“Do we have time to do that?” Chen Cangyi rolled his eyes at K. He was occupied with work every day now, so he had no time to practice martial arts.

He actually wasn’t complaining that Gu Ning left the whole business to him to manage.

“Why don’t we tell our boss to arrange for a bodyguard to protect us? I found several good killers, and I think the female one isn’t bad,” said K with a smile on his lips.

Although K was busy with the game company these days, he didn’t forget what Gu Ning told him to do earlier. He kept paying attention to the killer website. Once there was a killer chased by mercenaries, he would try to draw him or her to their side.

It was dangerous, because they might annoy those evil organizations, but Gu Ning didn’t care about that. After all, the only way to catch tiger cubs was to go into the tiger’s den. They needed a strong team.

Hearing that, Chen Cangyi blinked. “Do you like her?”

“I think she’s funny,” said K.

“S-Stop!” Those men finally realized that they were no match for Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue, so they begged them to stop at once. However, Gu Ning wouldn’t listen to them.

There was a smile of mockery on her lips. They had tried to hurt her people, so it was impossible for her to stop beating them right now.

“We’re from the Kirin Gang. If you dare to injury us, the Kirin Gang won’t let you get away with it!”

Seeing that Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue refused to stop, a man threatened them.

Hearing that, Gu Ning stopped. “Are you really from the Kirin Gang?” she coldly asked, squinting her eyes.

The man thought that Gu Ning was scared, so he showed pride. “Of course, we’re from the Kirin Gang.”

Gu Ning beamed and said in an evil tone, “Since you’re from the Kirin Gang, there is no need for me to hesitate to beat you. No matter what happens to you, Qi Tianlin will handle it.”

“What?”

The man was shocked. Qi Tianlin was their leader, but why did it seem that Gu Ning was familiar with him.

Before the man regained his senses, he was heavily beaten again.

Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue didn’t stop until all eight men were injured.

They were seriously injured with either broken arms or legs, but their lives weren’t in danger.

K and Chen Cangyi got out of their car when they saw that all the men were under control. They were slightly injured, but they could still move.

Their car was greatly damaged, so they couldn’t stay in there any longer.

After Gu Ning came, Chen Cangyi called his secretary and told him to come to deal with the rest of the things.

Gu Ning then took out a porcelain bottle and handed it to K. “Each of you take a pill.”

“Thanks, boss,” said K and took it. They were all aware of the unbelievable effect of Gu Ning’s medicine.

After that, Gu Ning coldly looked at the men beside her feet and asked, “Tell me, who sent you here?”

No one answered, even though they felt threatened by Gu Ning.

“Fine, it seems that you don’t take what I just said seriously.” Gu Ning sneered. She didn’t bother to continue to ask them. Instead, she took out her phone and showed a piece of news to the man she asked.

“If you don’t believe that I know Qi Tianlin, read this news,” said Gu Ning.

The news introduced the influential figures who went to attend the opening ceremony of Jade Beauty Jewelry, the Heiqi Organization was included.

The man rounded his eyes in shock. To his surprise, Gu Ning really knew their leader.

Although the news only mentioned the Heiqi Organization and Gu Ning might not know their leader, Gu Ning did in fact really know many people of the Kirin Gang.

In addition to that, Shengshi, Tanghuang, Qinghua, and Jinlin were also invited.

Gu Ning’s connections were really amazing!

“Well, now are you going to answer my question or not? If you are, I can forgive you for what you’ve done today. I won’t tell Qi Tianlin about it. If not, I’ll go talk with him about it in detail,” said Gu Ning in a threatening tone. She gave them a chance because she had seriously injured them. Anyway, she couldn’t kill them.

If it wasn’t necessary, she was reluctant to kill.

“Yeah, yeah, I’ll tell you.” The man was scared. “It’s Sun Xiangming.”

Gu Ning didn’t know who Sun Xiangming was, but Chen Cangyi and K knew, so they looked mad once they heard his name.

Nevertheless, they weren’t surprised, because only their enemies in business would cause them trouble. Sun Xiangming was precisely such an enemy business.

“Our warning seems useless to him.. On the contrary, it made him more aggressive,” said K in a flat voice, but he was actually furious.
