Chapter 1470: Tang Yaxin and Qi Ziyue’s Wedding

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

It was undeniable that Qi Ziyue was outstanding, but he couldn’t be promoted to deputy executive without Tang Yaxin’s help.

At the beginning, Tang Bingsen didn’t think that Qi Ziyue could be successful and his daughter should marry into another super-rich family, so he reminded Tang Yaxin not to take her relationship with Qi Ziyue seriously. However, Qi Ziyue was involved in Tang Aining’s death later, and Tang Bingsen was worried that Qi Ziyue might expose his dirty secrets if he kicked him out of his family, which was the reason why he allowed Tang Yaxin to marry Qi Ziyue.

...

Qi Ziyue noticed those negative comments on him as well. He was furious, but fury was useless. Anyway, he had already achieved his goal, and that was all he wanted.

...

In the Tang family’s manor.

The event location was decorated very well and it looked extremely luxurious and romantic.

At 2 pm, Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin were ready but they stayed in different lounges for the time being.

Qi Ziyue was in a white suite today, which accentuated his handsome appearance.

While Tang Yaxin was in a wedding gown customized by Jason from Paris, and she looked more elegant than usual, because although Tang Yaxin was born in a super-rich family, she normally behaved like a foxy woman. Nevertheless, she was totally different at her wedding today.

Tang Yaxin’s female friends were her bridesmaids.

“My daughter is so gorgeous. I’ve never seen a bride who’s more beautiful than her!” Ji Yijing kept complimenting her daughter.

At the same time, she couldn’t help but think of Tang Aining and felt displeased. Although she was unwilling to admit it, it was a fact that Tang Aining was prettier than Tang Yaxin. Fortunately, Tang Aining was dead.

The existence of Tang Aining’s mother was a humiliation in Tang Bingsen’s eyes, because Tang Bingsen relied on Tang Aining’s mother to become successful.

Tang Aining’s mother was too outstanding and admired, so almost everyone thought that he was a kept man.

In that situation, Ji Yijing seized the chance and became Tang Bingsen’s mistress. And because of Tang Aining’s mother, Tang Bingsen hated Tang Aining too and never treated her as his daughter.

“I agree, Yaxin is always stunning!”

“Not every girl can look as attractive in a wedding gown as Yaxin does.”

“...”

Many people began to flatter Tang Yaxin, even though Tang Yaxin wasn’t actually the prettiest girl at the scene. Anyway, Tang Yaxin had great confidence in her appearance. She never thought that other people were flattering her, because she believed that she was more beautiful than any other girls around her.

...

Ji Yijing didn’t stay in the bride’s lounge for long, and soon left to welcome the guests. At this time, many influential figures in politics, business, entertainment, and media were all present.

It was Tang Yaxin and Qi Ziyue’s wedding, but it was also an important event for people in high society to gather together. So many guests came for a purpose.

All of the invited people were either rich or powerful, so it was a great chance for them to socialize. Therefore, guests of the same purpose always stood in a circle and chatted with each other. Some super-rich young girls or boys were also busy striking up a conversation with their targets.

Normally, the younger generation from families of the same social status could easily become friends with one another. Actually, they didn’t have many choices as to their marriage because of their family background, so they had to choose from within their friend circle.

“Look, that’s Lord Liu. His father is a senior official in the government and his mother was born in the Feng family.”

“Although a senior official isn’t as rich as a successful businessman, the Feng family relies on Lord Liu’s father to expand its business.”

“Oh, that’s Lord Wang. He’s 28 this year, and his family has over a billion yuan in wealth. Most importantly, he’s single.”

“Lord Ming is there! He’s unmarried, but he’s already 30. I heard that he has a girlfriend from an ordinary family, but his family is reluctant to accept the girl.”

“I don’t think the poor girl can marry into his family.”

“I see Lord Fu there. Although his family isn’t very rich, he’s a relative of the Tang family.”

“...”

“Look, Lady Zhou is back home after studying abroad for years. She’s working in her family’s business now, but unfortunately she has an older brother, or she can take over.”

“Lady Chen also came today. Both of her parents are senior officials in the government. Countless businessmen want her to be their daughter-in-law.”

“Lady Yu is 22 this year, and she’s interested in acting. The Yu family has an entertainment company in the industry, so nobody dares to harass her.”

“...”

Most people in high society were unwilling to lose their influence or wealth, so they only paid attention to other people in the same circle as them.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
