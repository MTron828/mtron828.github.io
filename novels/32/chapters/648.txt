Chapter 649 No Right to Sentence

“You’re right.” Leng Shaoting agreed.

When Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning drove to a road with little traffic, Leng Shaoting stopped the car all of a sudden. They pretended that the engine was acting up, and got out of the car to check it.

Seeing that, the two men stopped behind them and also left their car. “Hey, may I help?” one of them asked. They tried to approach them.

“Thanks!” Leng Shaoting said, and the two men walked towards them.

When they walked near, they suddenly attacked Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. However, both Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were already prepared, so they reacted within a second.

The two men were stunned because they didn’t expect that they would be so quick, but they kept attacking them. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

People who drove by this road all stopped and filmed the fight. Nevertheless, none of them dared to come closer, so their faces weren’t clear in the video.

Some of them also immediately called the police.

After a while, the killers didn’t gain any advantage, but Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning also failed to get control of them. Gu Ning was sure now that they must be bounty hunters.

To the killers’ astonishment, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were better than them in a fight. Therefore, they took out guns.

Seeing that, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning dashed forward to stop them. The killers weren’t weak either, but failed to aim at them accurately.

Once they showed the guns, most onlookers drove away, and only a few stayed to watch, but they all stayed a far distance away.

At short notice, Gu Ning drew a dagger and cut one of the killer’s wrists with great force. The gun fell from his hand at once, and Gu Ning kicked it away.

The killer was greatly surprised, because he didn’t see when and where Gu Ning pulled out the dagger.

This killer without his gun was barely a match for Gu Ning and it was super easy for Gu Ning to beat him down now.

As for Leng Shaoting, he was even better and more experienced than Gu Ning in a fight. He dislocated the other killer’s arm without hesitation and grabbed the gun away, then kicked the killer on the knee so the killer knelt on the ground and couldn’t resist at all.

At the same time, Gu Ning quickly got control of the killer fighting against her.

The scene shocked everyone around. They caught the two killers with guns within just a few minutes!

Although Leng Shaoting was better than Gu Ning, people were still more impressed by Gu Ning because she was a slim young girl. In their eyes, girls were always the weak, but what Gu Ning did totally changed their opinions.

“Tell us. Who sent you here?” Gu Ning asked coldly.

The two killers remained silent.

“Well.” Gu Ning wore a cold face, then heavily stepped on a killer’s ankle. With a crisp sound, it was broken and the killer’s face was twisted in great pain. “Tell us,” Gu Ning said again.

However, they still remained quiet.

“If you refuse to tell us, you could die,” Leng Shaoting said staring straight at them.

Even so, the two killers still seemed tough. “Our nationality is Country Y, and your country has no right to sentence us.”

It was the truth. Without an extradition agreement, another country had no right to sentence them.

Besides, the two killers didn’t believe that Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting would dare to kill them, because it would turn into a serious international problem. As long as they could flee back to Country Y, they would be safe.

“Oh, really?” Leng Shaoting didn’t seem worried at all. He took out his military officer card with a calm face. “Don’t you know that you can be sentenced to death if you try to assassinate a military officer?”

Seeing that, the two killers were stunned again.

“Tell us who sent you here. I can punish you lightly and it won’t become an international case. As for what will happen to you in the future, it totally depends on yourself,” Leng Shaoting said.

It was an attempted murder, so they wouldn’t be sentenced death according to the law. Of course, if Leng Shaoting wanted them to die, it was just a matter of a few words, but he would fulfill his promise once he made it.

The two killers were now scared of Leng Shaoting’s real identity. However, if they told him, they would be killed by their client because they broke the rules. Besides, they weren’t sure whether Leng Shaoting would keep his promise. Even so, it was possible that they could stay alive if they told him, and they could die right away if they refused to do so.

After struggling, they decided to tell him. Although they were killers, they were afraid of death too.

“It’s Aimee Hill from the Hill family,” the man who was under Leng Shaoting’s control said.

Hearing that, Gu Ning frowned, but was not very surprised, because she knew that Aimee wouldn’t give up.

“Do you know the person?” In the beginning, Leng Shaoting thought that their target was him, but they told him a very strange name. He had heard of the Hill family, but he had never been in touch with it, let alone had conflicts or a grudge against it.

Seeing Gu Ning’s reaction, he realized that Gu Ning was their target.

“We had conflict,” Gu Ning said, but didn’t tell him details.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was mad.
