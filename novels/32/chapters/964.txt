966 The Star of Africa, and the King of Diamonds

Therefore, there was no need for them to be worried.

At 7:20 am, Gu Man was ready, but she had to stay in the bedroom waiting for the Tang family to pick her up.

Gu Ning brought Leng Shaoting to see Gu Man, and Leng Shaoting gave her the gift he had prepared for her. “Happy wedding day; this is a gift for you!”

Saying that, Leng Shaoting handed the paper bag to Gu Man.

“Thank you so much!” Gu Man was happy to receive the gift. She knew that it had to be very expensive, but it was out of Leng Shaoting’s kindness, so she accepted it. In addition, Leng Shaoting was Gu Ning’s boyfriend, so she wouldn’t turn him down.

“Mom, open it. What is inside?” Gu Ning asked with curiosity. She didn’t use her Jade Eyes to check, because it would be disrespectful.

“Alright!” Gu Man had no intention to open the gift right in front of Leng Shaoting, but she agreed to do so since Gu Ning wanted to see what was inside.

There was a necklace with a boat-shaped diamond pendant, weighing about ten karats in the jewelry box.

“Wow, it’s so beautiful!” Gu Ning was impressed. Although she couldn’t recognize the type of diamond, it looked much prettier and more shiny than normal diamonds.

“Indeed, it’s very shiny!” Gu Man fell in love with it at first glance.

“What type of diamond is this? It looks totally different from normal diamonds,” Gu Ning asked.

“It’s the Star of Africa, and the King of Diamonds,” Leng Shaoting said.

The Star of Africa, and the King of Diamonds?

Gu Ning had heard of it before, and it cost five million yuan a karat because of its rarity.

The diamond on this necklace weighed 10 karats, which meant that it cost at least fifty million yuan, and that was only the price of the raw diamond.

This luxurious diamond necklace must be the work of a famous skilled jewelry designer. In that case, it should cost around seventy million yuan.

“It must be very expensive, right?” Although Gu Man hadn’t heard of it before, she knew that its price had to be very high given its title.

Leng Shaoting had no intention to tell Gu Man the price, but Gu Ning did because she hoped that it would leave a good impression on Gu Man. “Mom, the Star of Africa costs five million yuan a karat, and the diamond on this necklace in your hand weighs around 10 karats, so it cost at least fifty million yuan. Including the designer’s fee, it should cost about seventy million yuan.”

“What? This necklace costs seventy million yuan? It’s too expensive!” Gu Man was shocked.

“It’s fine. If you like you, its price doesn’t matter at all,” Leng Shaoting said with sincerity. He meant it, because he just wanted Gu Man to be happy.

“Well, of course I like it.” Gu Man could barely put the necklace down, because she was literally stunned by it. However, she still thought that it was too expensive and she was afraid that she might damage or lose it.

At the same time, she also understood that it might hurt Leng Shaoting if she returned his gift because of its price.

“Thank you so much, Shaoting!” Gu Man said.

“I’m glad you like it,” Leng Shaoting said.

...

Around 7:30 am, Hao Ran and the others arrived.

Hearing their voices, Gu Ning went downstairs and asked Gu Qing and Wen Yulan to chat with Gu Man in the room, in case Gu Man felt bored.

...

At this time the line of wedding cars also set off from the Tang family’s house to pick Gu Man up.

When 12 luxurious cars appeared in line on the road, people were all attracted to it.

It wasn’t the most luxurious line of wedding cars, because many people chose to rent expensive cars on their wedding day to show off, and it didn’t cost much to rent a line of cars. Nevertheless, it was still uncommon for ordinary people to see so many luxurious cars.

...

Tang Yunfan wanted to hold a grand wedding for Gu Man, but Gu Man preferred to keep it simple.

Even though it was the first time that Gu Man was getting married, and she also dreamed of having a grand wedding, she wasn’t a young girl anymore. She would feel shy if the wedding was too noticeable.

Moreover, they truly loved each other, so there was no need for them to waste so much money on a ceremony. Even though the Tang family could afford a grand wedding as long as she wanted one, Gu Man thought that it wasn’t necessary.

In Tang Yunfan’s eyes, their wedding was very simple, but it was super luxurious in common people’s opinion.

...

Tang Yunfan didn’t sleep much that night either, but he was still full of energy when he got up the next morning.

At 7:50 am the line of wedding cars arrived. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Tang Yunfan, Tang Yunhang, Cao Ruihua, Cao Wenjun, Tang Jiayang, Tang Jiakai, and other male members of the Tang family all showed up. The female members of the Tang family, including Cao Wenxin, however, stayed in the house and waited for Gu Man’s arrival.

Xin Bei was Cao Wenxin’s boyfriend, but he was still a guest today, so he wouldn’t show up until the reception dinner in the hotel.

As the leading role in the Tang family, Tang Haifeng obviously shouldn’t show up right now. He was waiting for the newlyweds to serve him tea in the Tang family’s house, which was a part of the ceremony.

Seeing that the line of luxurious cars was sent out by the Tang family, everyone was shocked again.

The Tang family was super-rich, so each of those cars cost at least ten million yuan.

It wasn’t a secret that the Tang family was a super-rich family in City B, so onlookers soon accepted the shocking news.

...

“Why do I feel like the bridegroom looks very familiar?” An Ye said all of a sudden when he saw Tang Yunfan.

Hao Ran and the others turned to look at Tang Yunfan for a while before Chu Peihan said, “The bridegroom closely resembles our boss, so that’s why you feel like he looks familiar.”

Hearing that, everyone nodded, but An Yi had a different idea.
