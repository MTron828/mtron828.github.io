Chapter 670 Wu Yuanping

No matter how powerful or rich a person was, he or she could have shortcomings as well. And no matter how weak or poor a person was for now, he or she could also beat a strong enemy with the right tactics.

Tang Weiyong had succeeded in attacking Tang Yunfan twice. Gu Ning had overcome many difficulties which didn’t seem solvable so that she was able to achieve a lot today. Many rich men had been abducted and blackmailed. Many leaders of some countries had also been murdered. There were many other shocking events in this world. Therefore, no matter if you were powerful or weak, it could be changed.

Power and wealth could protect you, but could also put you in a dangerous position.

Tang Weiyong was paying special attention to news about Gu Ning. Without a doubt, he was shocked by Gu Ning’s network too, but he didn’t care about it, and would never give up his scheme against Gu Ning. Besides, businessmen gathered for interests, and dispersed once there was no benefit.

Tang Weiyong had experienced that in person.

Accordingly, he would keep on competing against Tang Haifeng and Gu Ning. Moreover, since he found out that Gu Ning wasn’t a weak competitor at all, he would be more careful, and more determined to remove Gu Ning from his way to success. As for Tang Yunfan, Tang Weiyong believed that he was still unconscious.

It was already very lucky that Tang Yunfan had survived such a serious car accident.

Tang Yunfan was the chairman of Tanghuang Group, so his subordinates had also visited him. They were all sure that Tang Yunfan was still lying in the bed.

In that case, Tang Weiyong removed Tang Yunfan’s name from his target list.

A short time after the opening ceremony of Jade Beauty Jewelry, someone came to cause Gu Ning trouble.

He was a man who was around 40 years old, and he demanded to see Gu Ning, the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry, once he walked inside.

Since the man came to see her, Gu Ning showed up.

“Wu Yuanping?” Before Gu Ning could say something, Tang Haifeng recognized the man.

Wu Yuanping was surprised to see Tang Haifeng, then greeted him with great respect, “Master Tang.”

“May I help, Mr. Wu?” Gu Ning asked. Although she sensed that this man wasn’t coming for anything good, she remained polite since he knew Tang Haifeng.

“I heard that the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry made the first bucket of gold by stone gambling. Is that true?” Wu Yuanping asked.

“Yes,” Gu Ning replied.

“Just by stone gambling, you’ve never taken out a loan?” Wu Yuanping asked again.

“Yes,” Gu Ning replied once more.

Hearing that, people around them were all astonished. They had all heard that Gu Ning had made a lot of money by stone gambling, but none of them expected that Gu Ning had earned the whole Jade Beauty Jewelry by it. In other words, Gu Ning had made over a hundred million yuan by stone gambling! Thinking of that, people were all shocked.

Reporters also realized that it was a very important moment, so they all turned on their cameras, trying to film it.

“It’s very impressive that you can make so much money just by stone gambling. I have great admiration for you, but I still want to challenge you,” Wu Yuanping said.

“Wu Yuanping, what do you want to do?” Tang Haifeng frowned in annoyance. It was obvious that Wu Yuanping came here to cause Gu Ning trouble. However, to Tang Haifeng’s surprise, Wu Yuanping dared to do that right in front of his eyes.

“He’s here to cause trouble!”

“Right, but I’m curious what exactly he’s going to do.”

“Doesn’t he know the close relationship between Miss Gu and Master Tang?”

Onlookers all believed that Wu Yuanping was crazy.

Gu Man and Gu Ning’s friends, however, was afraid that it might affect the business of the jewelry store. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When Wu Yuanping heard people’s discussion, he frowned. Although he didn’t dare to annoy Master Tang, he had no intention to step back. He had seen many people who became rich by stone gambling, but what Gu Ning had achieved was beyond his imagination. How was she able to establish a high-end jewelry brand just by stone gambling?

Stone gambling was well-known as a highly-risky game, but Gu Ning could easily make money by it, which was unacceptable in Wu Yuanping’s eyes. He had been involved in stone gambling for over 20 years, and what Gu Ning had achieved was simply a miracle in this industry.

“It’s fine. I can handle it.” Gu Ning comforted Tang Haifeng. Tang Haifeng respected Gu Ning’s decisions, so he remained silent. After that, Gu Ning looked at Wu Yuanping and asked, “So what do you want to do?”

Gu Ning knew that he wouldn’t leave without a result, and he aroused her interest too.

“I want to have a competition with you,” Wu Yuanping said.

“Ningning.” Tang Haifeng was slightly worried, and wanted to stop Gu Ning, because he knew that Wu Yuanping was very experienced in stone gambling. If Gu Ning lost, it would affect the reputation of her jewelry store.

People didn’t care where she got the jade, but nobody liked the feeling of being deceived.

However, if Gu Ning rejected, people might think that Gu Ning was guilty and didn’t dare meet the challenge. Therefore, Tang Haifeng debated whether to stop Gu Ning or not.

“Ningning.” Gu Man, Tang Yunrong and the others were also worried.

“Don’t worry. Trust me,” Gu Ning said with confidence.

Since Gu Ning was confident about herself, they didn’t say anything further.

In the store, only Leng Shaoting and Zhou Zhenghong completely believed in Gu Ning, because they had witnessed her ability of stone gambling
