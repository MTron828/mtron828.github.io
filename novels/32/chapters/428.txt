Chapter 429 Couldn’t Bear the Result?

Gu Ning shrugged. “That’s your own business, but we still need to write down an agreement.”

“Even if we write down the agreement, what can you do to me if I regret afterwards?” Qi Tianlin said airily. In his eyes, there was no need to write down an agreement at all.

“Do you mean that you’ll regret if you lose?” Gu Ning asked.

“What if I want to?” Qi Tianlin asked.

“I don’t care. Nobody can steal my belongings from me.” Gu Ning actually didn’t care about what Qi Tianlin would do, because she was confident to get what she wanted. “Let’s begin!”

After that, the two started to stack the dice cup.

Qi Tianlin and Gu Ning were at ease, and the men who worked for Qi Tianlin believed in their boss, but Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai were so nervous that their palms were wet with sweat. The two kept hoping that Gu Ning would win.

After a short while, both of them placed their dice cups on the table at the same time.

“After you,” Qi Tianlin said.

Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes and saw the numbers in his dice cup. “12.”

Qi Tianlin’s pupils were slightly dilated. Although he wasn’t sure whether the numbers added up to 12 or not, it was very possible.

Qi Tianlin opened the dice cup. It indeed was 12, and now he was in a dangerous position.

Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai almost shouted in excitement. They all hoped that Qi Tianlin would fail.

“17,” Qi Tianlin said.

Gu Ning smiled gently and opened her dice cup. Unfortunately, there were three sixes inside, which added up to 18.

“You lose,” Gu Ning said, but she didn’t show any pride, as if she already knew the result. Then she took out a piece of paper with her bank account written on it, and threw it at Qi Tianlin. “Transfer the money to me now.”

Qi Tianlin gave it a glance, then turned to Gu Ning. “What if I refuse to do so? This is my place, so what can you do to me?” He was going to deny the result.

Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai both changed their expressions all of a sudden, because the man indeed regretted. Cao Wenxin wanted to argue with him. However, thinking of what Gu Ning had reminded them, she remained silent.

Gu Ning silently stared at him with a faint smile on her lips. She looked charming, but also dangerous.

“Are you sure?” Gu Ning asked in a flat voice, but she was planning in her heart for the following storm.

Actually, Qi Tianlin could afford the result, but he just had a burning curiosity about Gu Ning and wanted to see her reaction. Hearing what Gu Ning said, he knew that she was going to take action, which aroused his anticipation.

“Very well. I hope you won’t regret,” Gu Ning said coldly, then stood up saying to Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai, “Let’s go.”

Gu Ning didn’t do anything, which disappointed Qi Tianlin. “Did I allow you to leave?”

The moment Qi Tianlin finished his sentence, the two security guards instantly walked over and blocked their way, aiming guns at them.

And now, Gu Ning was furious. In fact, she was simply worried about Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai’s safety, so she planned to take them away before she came back to Qi Tianlin. Unexpectedly, Qi Tianlin wouldn’t let them leave.

Without hesitation, Gu Ning attacked the two security guards before her. With several quick movements, she broke their wrists and dislocated their arms, and the guns fell into her hands.

Afterwards, Gu Ning kicked the two security guards once again. She used her power, and the two security guards were directly kicked away in opposite directions. They could barely stand up in a short time.

To Qi Tianlin’s astonishment, Gu Ning was so good at fighting. And exactly because of shock, he was struck dumb for a few seconds. During that time, Gu Ning seized the chance and gave the two handguns she grabbed from the two security guards to Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai. They had both served in the army, so it was pretty easy for them to use a gun.

Qi Tianlin was in a rage, and he immediately took out a gun from his waist, aiming at Gu Ning. Meanwhile, Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai both aimed their guns at Qi Tianlin too.

Qi Tianlin snorted with a cold laughter. “This is my place. Do you really think that you can escape?”

He didn’t believe that they could leave here safely, but he had to admit that Gu Ning was far more interesting than he had thought. She was so surprisingly agile that his security guards were beaten down before they could even react. If they couldn’t beat a young girl in a fight, they must be useless, and it was time for him to change security guards.

“Let’s see!” Gu Ning was also confident and mocked, “I didn’t expect that the head of the Kirin Gang is a man who can’t bear the result of his own decision. Since you can’t afford it, then don’t gamble. Even I feel ashamed for you.”

Hearing that, Cao Wenxin and Tang Jiakai were surprised. What? The head of the Kirin Gang? Qi Tianlin?And Gu Ning dares to swear at Qi Tianlin face to face?

Qi Tianlin squinted and looked like a hungry wolf. He was surprised that Gu Ning knew him, and was also mad that she dared to humiliate him. Gu Ning said that even she felt ashamed for him. Fine! He did lose, but he also chose to deliberately not pay the bill to see her reaction. However, it was still reasonable that Gu Ning despised him for his behavior.

Gu Ning knew who he was and dared to humiliate him, which was a challenge to his authority, so he was quite displeased. “Since you know who I am, you should know that nobody can change my mind.”

“Nobody can change your mind? Me either. No one can stop me from doing whatever I want,” Gu Ning retorted. “So, if you don’t want to die, let us leave, and transfer the three billion yuan to my account.” Since they were already in trouble, she wouldn’t yield!

Qi Tianlin raised his eyebrow. “Are you threatening me? Do you know that whoever threatens me won’t have a good ending, including women?” Indeed, he never bothered to cherish a beauty.

“Aren’t you threatening me now as well?” Gu Ning ridiculed. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qi Tianlin didn’t expect that Gu Ning would give him the same answer. “You’re persuasive.” Nevertheless, Gu Ning threatened him, which he held zero tolerance for. “You injured my men’s arms and you also want my money? Do you think that I’ll agree?”

“It was your men who aimed their guns at me first. It’s already a mercy that I just dislocated their arms and unarmed them,” Gu Ning said calmly.

“And now your friends are aiming at me. What should I do to them?” Qi Tianlin squinted again with danger in his eyes.
