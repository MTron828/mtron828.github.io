Chapter 2700: Isn’t My Body Attractive?

Hearing that, the crowd began to talk about it. Although they were forbidden to take drugs in nightclubs, not everyone would listen. Therefore, it wasn’t surprising if Chang Kairui was on drugs.

“No, we don’t do that!” Chang Kairui’s friends denied it at once. They had never been on drugs.

“But I think his reaction proves everything. I’ve seen someone overdosed like that before. Or he might be having an epileptic fit. However, he hasn’t bitten his tongue, so it’s c

learly not that.” Leng Shaoting continued. He was determined to make people believe that Chang Kairui was on drugs.

“Nonsense! Don’t damage his reputation,” Chang Kairui’s friend shouted. If other people heard that Chang Kairui was on drugs, it would cause serious trouble.

Leng Shaoting said nothing further, because what he said was enough.

The majority of the crowd believed that Chang Kairui overdosed.

Because Chang Kairui was a frequent visitor, many people were familiar with him. Some of them held grudges against him, so they didn’t hesitate to spread the news quickly.

Even if Chang Kairui wasn’t on drugs, they didn’t care about the truth.

Before long, the manager of the nightclub received the news and came over. He was scared and trembled in fear. If anything went wrong with Chang Kairui, the club would be closed and he might be in trouble too.

The manager had seen many people on drugs before, so he easily identified that Chang Kairui overdosed, but he wasn’t dumb so he wouldn’t say it aloud.

However, he spent a lot of time with Chang Kairui, so he knew that Chang Ruikai was unlikely to do drugs. It was strange that Chang Ruikai suddenly overdosed today. However, he would only get this agitated and twitch on the ground if he overdosed.

No matter, it wasn’t the right time to ask about that right now.

A while later, an ambulance arrived and Chang Kairui was taken to the hospital.

Other people in the club weren’t affected by Chang Kairui, and they continued to enjoy themselves after he was taken away.

Right after Chang Kairui was taken to the hospital, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning left. They went to the same hospital afterwards.

Given the Chang family’s status, they would surely remove the news from the media, so Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning had to do something to make sure more people heard the news.

After finding out which hospital the ambulance belonged to, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting took a taxi and followed. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As soon as the ambulance reached the hospital, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting arrived.

Once Chang Kairui got in trouble, his friends called his family, but they didn’t know Chang Kairui parents’ number, so they only called his older brother.

The moment Chang Kairui’s older brother heard about it, he called their parents. Therefore, half an hour later, Chang Kairui’s parents also arrived at the hospital.

Before that, Chang Kairui’s medical report came out. He had indeed taken a lot of drugs, which surprised his friends, because they didn’t see him take drugs!

Therefore, Chang Kairui’s friends doubted the result.

Facing their doubt, the doctor was angry. “If you don’t believe it, get him checked in another hospital. How could you know whether he’s on drugs? Would he tell you about it before he took drugs?”

Chang Kairui wasn’t clear-headed. He felt as if he was in a nightmare and couldn’t hear anything.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t have the chance to read the report, so Gu Ning disguised herself for a nurse. She sneaked into Chang Kairui’s ward and set up a micro camera to record everything.

In that case, even if they stopped the report from being exposed, the news that Chang Kairui was on drugs would still go abroad.

After Chang Kairui’s parents and older brother came, they were shocked and angry to hear that he overdosed and was witnessed by a large group of people.

They always told their two sons to stay away from drugs. If they got addicted to drugs, their lives would be ruined. Unfortunately, their younger son still ended up on drugs and even overdosed.

If it went abroad, it would seriously damage their family’s reputation and they honestly didn’t know how to explain it to the Old Master of their family.

They could only destroy this report now and tell the other people who knew about it to keep it a secret.

The others were scared of the Chang family, so they definitely wouldn’t tell anyone else.

However, they couldn’t stop the others in the nightclub from spreading the news. Anyway, they didn’t have evidence, so they could easily deny it if the news really went public. They could claim it to be angina pectoris [1. A type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart.].

Gu Ning recorded their conversation.

With the evidence, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting left, but they didn’t release it right away. They decided to wait until tomorrow.

It was very late when they left the hospital, so they didn’t go to the siheyuan, but directly returned to Mid-Levels Mansion.

Back in Mid-Levels Mansion, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning removed their makeup and went back to how they normally looked.

After removing their makeup, Leng Shaoting immediately undressed and told Gu Ning to do the same. Gu Ning was amused by how horny he was.

Seeing Gu Ning’s resigned look, Leng Shaoting said, “Ningning, my body can only be owned by you. You can do whatever you want. Other people can only be jealous of you.”

Upon hearing that, Gu Ning understood that Leng Shaoting was referring to what they heard in the nightclub.

“You’re very satisfied with your body,” said Gu Ning.

“Isn’t my body attractive?” Leng Shaoting focused on Gu Ning, putting some pressure on her.

“Of course it’s attractive.” Gu Ning explained at once. If she didn’t chime in, Leng Shaoting wouldn’t stop asking her. Anyway, it was true that Leng Shaoting had a very attractive body.

“Ningning, do you like it?” asked Leng Shaoting.

“Yes!” said Gu Ning.

After that, they had sex for a night.

The next day.

Obviously, someone schemed against Chang Kairui, and a video of him taking drugs was soon uploaded to Weibo last night. It went viral that afternoon.

Chang Kairui wasn’t a celebrity, so not many people knew him, but because of his family background, he attracted a lot of attention.

When the Chang family heard about it, the news had already become a hot topic, which angered them.

In fact, only Chang Kairui’s family knew he was in trouble, the other members of the Chang family were unaware of it. Some of them read the news on Weibo and reported it to Master Chang, then everyone heard about it.
