“Zhiyu!” The girl followed him at once and explained. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said something like that just then, but I didn’t think much.”

“You don’t need to apologize to me, because I don’t care about what you do,” said the man with impatience.

“I...” The girl still wanted to say something, but didn’t know what she could say, because she could feel the man’s obvious impatience.

The girl was quite aggrieved in her heart. She didn’t understand why he treated her that way. What had she done wrong? She was born in a rich family and was pretty, but he never paid attention to her. However, she was still worried that the man might become angrier, so she remained silent.

After walking around for five minutes, Chu Peihan received Gu Ning’s call. Gu Ning had already arrived and asked her where they were right now. She would come to see them.

Chu Peihan told her their position and Gu Ning showed up in three minutes, after which they went shopping together.

They needed to look at bedclothes and clothing, because they couldn’t bring many clothes with only one suitcase.

They were all students, and shouldn’t wear too expensive clothes, so they went to shop for clothes in the range of several hundred yuan.

Several hundred yuan was nothing compared with international brands, but it actually wasn’t a little for students. Moreover, they were shopping for summer clothing.

Mu Ke wanted to pay for what Yu Mixi wanted to buy, but Yu Mixi declined. They were boyfriend and girlfriend now, but Yu Mixi thought that it was better for her not to use much of Mu Ke’s money. She only accepted it when they went out for a date or gave each other a gift.

At 3 pm, Leng Shaoting was back in the military base. Although he was going back to the Red Flame’s military base this time, he had to go to the military base for special forces that he had stayed in these days first.

Because he needed to take an exclusive plane to go to the Red Flame’s base, and the exclusive plane was stopped at the base for special forces

It wasn’t far from the city center of the capital, but it was hidden in distant mountains, so accidents could happen along the way.

Without surprise, Leng Shaoting encountered trouble this time.

A person suddenly rushed out of the woods, blocking Leng Shaoting’s path. Leng Shaoting was scared and slammed the brakes and stopped half a meter away from him.

At the same time, Leng Shaoting felt the familiar air. It was a cultivator and he was a member of the Evil Practice. Leng Shaoting squinted and became alert, then stared at the man.

The man was dressed all in black with an unkind face. It seemed that he wanted to kill Leng Shaoting, with greed and excitement in his eyes. Even though Leng Shaoting was at a low level, the man thought it was a great chance to absorb his energy. If Leng Shaoting was at a high level, he might have to think carefully about it.

Leng Shaoting wasn’t afraid to confront the man from the Evil Practice. However, to prevent his car from being damaged, Leng Shaoting got out of it and went to face the man.

“You’re brave!” Seeing Leng Shaoting’s behavior, the man was surprised, but he showed more mockery. What Leng Shaoting did was meaningless in his eyes.

“What do you want?” Leng Shaoting coldly asked.

“To absorb your energy and improve my own cultivation of course!” the man said with mockery.

“Great, let’s see whether you can do that,” said Leng Shaoting without the slightest fear. He challenged the man and stayed alert.

Leng Shaoting didn’t want to let the flood dragon out right now, because he planned to deal with it on his own. He needed more practical experience. If he really couldn’t win, he would let the flood dragon out to help him.

Thinking of the flood dragon, Leng Shaoting felt lucky at this moment. If Gu Ning hadn’t given it to him, he would have to rely on his own ability and luck to survive right now.

The man was mad when he was challenged by a cultivator at a lower level than him. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Very good, let me show you my abilities!” the man said with hatred, then attacked Leng Shaoting without delay. He moved fast and with great force, because he wanted to catch Leng Shaoting as soon as possible to prove his ability.

Leng Shaoting didn’t hesitate to fight back. However, even though he used his full strength, he might not be a match for the man.

It was really an exciting fight between two cultivators.

Leng Shaoting was at a low level, but he was actually stronger than other cultivators at the same level and was only a little weaker than those cultivators at higher levels than him.

As a result, when the man fought against Leng Shaoting, Leng Shaoting wasn’t defeated at once, which surprised him. He realized that Leng Shaoting wasn’t weak at all, even though he was at a higher level.

Because of the gap of their cultivation, Leng Shaoting did his best to barely protect himself from being hurt by the man. He was safe for the time being.

The man was quite displeased when he failed to catch Leng Shaoting within a short time.

“Young man, you better give up struggling. You’re no match for me,” said the man in a cold voice.

Although he admitted that Leng Shaoting was a very outstanding cultivator, he was still far better than him. He was confident that Leng Shaoting was no match for him.

“Show me your ability then,” said Leng Shaoting. Although he was at a disadvantage now, he had the flood dragon to help him. However, because he was still able to protect himself from being hurt by the man, he was unwilling to let the flood dragon out right away.

“Idiot!” the man said in anger, then kept on attacking Leng Shaoting.

As time went by, Leng Shaoting began to find it hard to fight back any longer, and he was in a more and more dangerous situation. So without hesitation, Leng Shaoting let the flood dragon out, because he didn’t want to be injured.

When he did that, he observed the surroundings to see whether there were other people. It would cause great trouble if other people saw the flood dragon. Luckily, there was no one else around them.

Once the flood dragon appeared, the man was stunned. He didn’t expect that Leng Shaoting had a flood dragon. Besides, the flood dragon obviously had greater cultivation than him, so the man felt threatened and wanted to escape. If he didn’t run away right now, he might die today.
