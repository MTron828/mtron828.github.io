2943 Don’t Bother Us

If their homes were in the capital, they went back home. If not, Gu Ning made arrangements for them. The girls would stay at Century City in Gu Ning’s house, while the boys stayed in the Shengshi Hotel.

It wasn’t public that Leng Shaoting owned Shengshi yet, so not many people knew about it. Given his special status, he didn’t want to make it public.

However Leng Shaoting didn’t have the intention to show off his wealth. No matter whose name Shengshi was under, he didn’t care. He only wanted to develop it and make profits.

Gu Ning would stay in her house at Century City tonight because it was her home, and she would go to the wedding place from there.

Therefore, the Tang family also stayed in her house at Century City, because they needed to send her to the wedding venue.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t meet today, and only chatted on the phone before they went to sleep.

“Ningning, are you nervous?” Leng Shaoting asked Gu Ning. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“A little,” Gu Ning admitted. Even though she wasn’t afraid of anything and wouldn’t get nervous before any danger, she couldn’t sleep now that her wedding was about to be held tomorrow.

“How about you?” Gu Ning asked Leng Shaoting.

“I’m nervous too.” Leng Shaoting answered.

“Ha-ha.” Gu Ning snorted with laughter, then joked. “Major general, I can’t believe you’re nervous too.”

“It’s more that I’m looking forward to tomorrow’s wedding,” Leng Shaoting said. He had waited for it for so long.

Although they already had the marriage certificate, he felt their relationship wouldn’t be finalized until they held a wedding.

“I can’t wait either,” Gu Ning said. Right now she was filled with happiness.

She had to say that she was happy ever since getting together with Leng Shaoting.

No one was more important to her than Leng Shaoting.

On the wedding day.

Their wedding was held at Xiaoyao Mountain Villa, and the fleet that came to pick Gu Ning up was unbelievably grand. No one had seen something like it before.

There were not only cars, helicopters were also used.

When the bride walked out of her home, flower petals fell from the air, which was extremely romantic.

Some reporters were allowed to take a video at the event location, so many parts of the wedding were aired as a live stream. It caused a sensation on the Internet again and again.

“Jesus, it’s so dreamy and romantic.”

“Wow, it’s so grand. I’ve never seen a wedding like that before.”

“…”

All the Internet users were amazed and envious.

At the entrance of the Xiaoyao Mountain Villa, there were two endless lines of armed soldiers.

Because of the Leng family’s special status, all the guests were important figures, so the security had to be extremely tight.

The wedding was like a display of the powerful and wealthy people in their country, because most of the guests were tycoons in politics and business.

The importance of the guests shocked the whole country, because nobody had seen so many tycoons at one wedding before. Those important people hadn’t even shown up at other tycoons’ weddings.

This was enough to prove how powerful the Leng family, the Tang family, Gu Ning, and Leng Shaoting’s connections were.

“Jesus, I’m totally shocked. I’ve never seen such a grand wedding before. I think all the important figures of our country are present.”

“That’s not strange. After all, the Leng family has the highest status in our country, and the Tang family is also very rich.”

“Right, and it’s not only the Leng family and the Tang family, Gu Ning is also very influential.”

“Only excellent people and families deserve people and families of the same excellence.”

“…”

What they didn’t know was that the most powerful people at the wedding were those cultivators, but they kept a low profile because they couldn’t let the public know about their abilities.

Shangguan Yang and the other cultivators who had a close relationship with Leng Shaoting were also present, so no one would be able to cause any trouble today.

Gu Ning looked exquisite today. She rarely put on make-up, or only wore light make-up, so she looked unusually stunning at her wedding.

There was no girl who wasn’t jealous of her.

Situ Ye and Qi Tianlin came too, but they were leaders of illegal gangs, so they disguised themselves.

Both Situ Ye and Qi Tianlin had admired Gu Ning from afar, so they were unhappy that she married another man, but they still watched quietly.

The wedding went smoothly and nothing bad happened, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were relieved.

The wedding was such an important event, so they didn’t want any accidents to happen.

Because Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t want to be bothered after the wedding was over they got all of their close friends drunk at dinner.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were high level cultivators, so they wouldn’t get drunk no matter how much they drank.

“Why do I feel Gu Ning and Shaoting are getting them drunk on purpose?” Xu Qinyin asked, watching everything.

“Because they’re deliberately doing it.” Zhan Zhiyin was very sure of it.

“Why?” Gu Anna couldn’t understand it.

“Perhaps they don’t want to be bothered after the wedding is over,” Zi Beiying guessed.

“Fine, I wouldn’t like it either,” Xu Qinyin said. Upon thinking that a bunch of people kept on joking about the newly-wed couple and wouldn’t allow the couple to sleep in peace, she was scared.

In the end they didn’t embarrass Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting by pointing it out, because they sided with them.

Anyway, it was actually a little humiliating that so many men couldn’t defeat Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting in drinking.

After they were all drunk, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting arranged for them to sleep.

However, since Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting seemed clear-headed as always while the other men were all drunk, the rest of the guests were amazed.

Leng Shaoxi asked in surprise, “Jesus, why don’t you look drunk at all? They can barely stand up straight.”

“It’s a secret, and I can’t tell you.” Gu Ning put on a mysterious smile without saying anything, because it was a bit hard to explain.

“Come on, tell me please! I’m so curious!” Leng Shaoxi shouted at Gu Ning.

“We didn’t drink alcohol, we drank water.” Gu Ning secretly said to Leng Shaoxi. That was the only explanation she could give.

“You’re bad!” Leng Shaoxi rounded her eyes in shock.
