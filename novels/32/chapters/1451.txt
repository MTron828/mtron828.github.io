Chapter 1452: Be a Good Cultivator

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting frowned.

“I’m very sure that my father is my grandfather’s biological son, and I’m my father’s biological son,” Leng Shaoting said with certainty.

“My mother, however, isn’t my maternal grandfather’s biological daughter. It’s said that my mother and father saved my maternal grandfather’s life once so my maternal grandfather adopted my mother. My father and my mother were unmarried back then, and my mother married my father as my maternal grandfather’s daughter afterwards. My maternal grandfather left all his legacy to my mother after he passed away, but my mother had no interest in running the business. She served in the army just like my father, so the business gradually became the Shengshi Organization,” Leng Shaoting said. He started to believe that his mother might not be a mortal.

“Did you notice that your mother was different from other people?” Gu Ning asked.

Leng Shaoting had a good memory, and he still remembered what had happened when he was seven.

“Well, my father and mother always compared their fighting skills in the yard. My mother almost won every time, and I heard that my mother had saved my father many times before. I didn’t think it was strange until now,” Leng Shaoting said.

Leng Shaoting had that thought not because he disdained women, but because women were normally weaker than men.

Gu Ning nodded, but unfortunately Leng Shaoting’s mother had passed away for years till now. They could only learn something about cultivators from the cultivation world. As long as Leng Shaoting’s mother was a member of the cultivation world, they believed that they could find some useful information about her. Even if it was hard, they wouldn’t give up.

“I think we need to pay attention to it,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure, we need to do some research.” Leng Shaoting agreed. He had a feeling that there was a lot of trouble ahead once he became a cultivator. Anyway, Gu Ning already had a plan to learn more about cultivators, and he could help her now.

Both Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting couldn’t fall asleep, so the next morning, they got up at 5 am.

Gu Ning drove Leng Shaoting to an isolated place out of town.

“Since you’re a cultivator now, you’re destined to join the cultivation world. You must focus on your cultivation to become a good cultivator,” Gu Ning said.

Because Baili Zongyang and Baili Zongxue were in Century City, it wasn’t convenient for Leng Shaoting to practice his cultivation there. They couldn’t let other cultivators find him before he could control his cultivation. After all, it could be dangerous if other cultivators found him.

In addition, Gu Ning found that Leng Shaoting’s air of a cultivator could be covered by the magical power of a night-luminescent pearl.

The magical power of a night-luminescent pearl was different from the air of a cultivator, so other cultivators wouldn’t feel that Leng Shaoting was a cultivator even if Leng Shaoting encountered them in the future.

In other words, Leng Shaoting had to carry a night-luminescent pearl with him all the time. However, all cultivators wanted a night-luminescent pearl, so it wasn’t safe for Leng Shaoting to carry one with him everywhere, but he was left no choice.

“I understand, and I will become a good cultivator,” Leng Shaoting said. He was determined to be stronger so that he could help Gu Ning more in the future. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Gu Ning said, “According to the books I’ve read about cultivators, there are four levels of cultivation, namely turning the power into qi, turning qi into energy, from concrete to abstract, and then free spirit.”

“Although you can absorb the magical power of this night-luminescent pearl on your own and it can circulate in your body by itself, you’re not able to control it yet. You must learn to control it and make use of it.”

Leng Shaoting nodded and listened to Gu Ning. Gu Ning was much better than him in this aspect, so he was willing to listen to her.

They loved each other, and hoped that they could become better together.
