3345 A Ghost Cultivator

Perhaps these three people were sucked in and were in great danger!

They approached the cave. Li Mochen said to Leng Xiaoyao, “You stay up here. I’ll go down and take a look.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Okay.” Leng Xiaoyao responded. Although she was worried about Li Mochen, the current situation required one person to go down and one person to stay up. She needed to prevent things from coming up from below and hurting people without anyone being there to deal with them.

Li Mochen also wouldn’t allow her to go down alone, so Leng Xiaoyao didn’t argue with him.

The worst result would be that Li Mochen couldn’t handle it or was injured. It wouldn’t be a disaster.

“What? You want to go down? It’s crazy! Three people have already been sucked in. They still haven’t come out.”

Upon hearing Li Mochen’s words, someone immediately expressed their displeasure. It was an old expert from the archaeological team.

Because the old expert was simply concerned with his safety, Li Mochen wasn’t angry.

“What if we tie a rope around him?” Xu Ziji suggested. He was still afraid that an accident might happen. Three people were already in danger. He didn’t want anyone else to disappear again.

“No need.” Li Mochen refused and walked over directly.

Someone couldn’t stand Li Mochen’s arrogant appearance and said sarcastically, “Humph! He simply wants to steal our thunder. I want to see how he gets out after he goes in.”

The man was also from the archaeological team, but he was a young man.

Li Mochen ignored him, but Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t. She looked over with a cold gaze and said unhappily, “Since when did being brave enough to save people become showing off? Why are you here then?”

“You…” The man was angry and wanted to refute, but was rebuked by the old expert from the archaeological team. “Qian Feng, shut up.”

Although he also felt that Li Mochen was impulsive, Li Mochen simply wanted to save people. Even if he didn’t approve of it, he couldn’t say such things about others.

Qian Feng dared not say anything else. He just gave Leng Xiaoyao a glare.

However, when he saw Leng Xiaoyao’s icy eyes, he couldn’t help feeling a little scared.

Li Mochen approached the edge of the cave. He naturally felt a strong suction force, but he wasn’t immediately sucked in, which surprised everyone watching the scene.

“What’s going on? Why isn’t he being sucked in?”

“Is it because he’s heavy?”

“Even if he’s heavy, he’s merely about seventy-five kilograms. Everyone who was sucked in weighs the same!”

“That’s true. Could it be that he has special abilities?”

“That’s really possible!”

“…”

They weren’t just guessing randomly. After all, there had been strange things happening in front of them. If Li Mochen admitted that he had special abilities, most of them would believe it. Otherwise, how could they explain the situation here?

Li Mochen used the chaotic power in his body to resist, so the evil power couldn’t harm him. He could control himself and enter the tomb passage.

At the same time, in the tomb chamber.

An old man in a black robe who was meditating on a wooden coffin suddenly opened his eyes. His face was extremely wrinkled and his features were indistinguishable, but his eyes were very clear, revealing a strong sense of gloom and greed.

Then the old man stood up and attacked Li Mochen as soon as he entered the tomb chamber.

He knew that the visitor wasn’t simple, since he had the energy of a cultivator. Although Li Mochen wasn’t at a high level, if he absorbed his power, it would still be beneficial to him.

When Li Mochen entered the tomb passage, he stayed alert. Therefore, when the old man attacked him, he could react instantly and counterattack.

“Boom!” The collision of the two powers made a loud noise. Even the ground trembled a little, which frightened everyone.

“What happened?”

“Is it an earthquake?”

“Is it from the tomb?”

“Is that man alright?”

They guessed what had happened.

Leng Xiaoyao was still worried about Li Mochen’s safety, so she released her magical senses to investigate.

In the tomb chamber.

After the collision of the two powers, Li Mochen and the man both staggered back a few steps.

Then they tangled up again.

They both felt that they were being spied on. Li Mochen knew that it was Leng Xiaoyao, so he didn’t care.

The man didn’t know, but at the moment he didn’t have much thought to care. The sudden intrusion of Li Mochen wasn’t easy to deal with.

Although the chaotic power in Li Mochen’s body was strong, it could only emit corresponding power according to his level before he gained full control.

He hadn’t even reached the Foundation-building Period, so the power he emitted wasn’t very strong. Facing the man, who should be a ghost cultivator, it was still somewhat difficult.

However, it wasn’t easy for the ghost cultivator to injure him either.

The first two workers who were sucked in had already had their souls sucked away. There were only two withered corpses left.

The person who was sucked in later was still alive because the ghost cultivator hadn’t digested the previous soul. The person’s soul hadn’t been sucked away, but he was unconscious.

Li Mochen couldn’t do anything about the dead bodies, but he had to protect the one who was still alive.

When a human cultivator and a ghost cultivator fought against each other, it caused great impact. The ground frequently shook, scaring everyone.

Li Mochen and the ghost cultivator were both injured by the other’s power. The ghost cultivator’s level was ultimately higher than Li Mochen’s, so he was less seriously injured.

Once Leng Xiaoyao found out that Li Mochen was injured, she couldn’t stay outside and immediately walked towards the cave entrance.

“Hey!” Xu Ziji wanted to stop her, but it was too late. Leng Xiaoyao had already arrived at the entrance of the cave.

Like Li Mochen, Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t directly sucked in, but controlled herself to go down, which surprised everyone again.

“What kind of people are these two? They weren’t sucked in?”

“I don’t think they’re ordinary, otherwise they wouldn’t be so bold.”

“I hope they will all be safe.”

“…”

Everyone hoped that Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen would be fine, but there were a few who didn’t like them showing off like this. Therefore, they cursed secretly in their hearts, hoping that they would be in trouble.

Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen wanted to steal their thunder?

This was just the thought of these people who didn’t like them. Why did they not like them and think of them like this? Originally they wanted to show off, but they didn’t have the ability, so they were jealous of those who did.

After Leng Xiaoyao entered the tomb chamber, she saw Li Mochen and the ghost cultivator fighting. Li Mochen was obviously at a disadvantage and was also seriously injured. Leng Xiaoyao didn’t think too much and directly attacked the ghost cultivator.

Leng Xiaoyao with the ability of the Foundation-building Period wasn’t weak. Coupled with Li Mochen’s cooperation, the magical power and chaotic power were emitted together, and the power doubled. They gave the ghost cultivator a serious blow.

The ghost cultivator, who had originally held the upper hand, immediately felt threatened and became nervous. “There is no grudge between us. Why do you have to go against me?”
