Chapter 1101 Are You Tired?

They were curious to know, but they also knew that Leng Shaoting wouldn’t use his full strength in case Gu Ning would be hurt.Anyway, the competition was over and Song Haoyu lost. He felt quite upset and realized that that was exactly what Xu Jinchen wanted to see. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Ha-ha, Song Haoyu, you lost again!” Xu Jinchen laughed out loud.

“It’s crazy that you’re so amazing at such an early age. You’re also a girl!” Song Haoyu said.

“Thanks.” Gu Ning smiled.

“Are you tired?” Leng Shaoting walked to Gu Ning’s side and asked her with concern.

“No, I’m not,” Gu Ning said.

She said that to comfort Leng Shaoting, but Song Haoyu was badly hit. He was exhausted, but Gu Ning said she wasn’t tired. With the help of her magical power, it wasn’t easy for Gu Ning to feel tired.

“Miss Gu, have you been practicing fighting ever since you were a kid? Have you received professional training before?” Song Haoyu asked.

“Yeah, I’ve received devilish training before,” Gu Ning said.

Knowing that, Song Haoyu felt much better. Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary girl, but a girl who had received devilish training before, so it wasn’t as embarrassing that he lost. However, even though it wasn’t as embarrassing, he still felt hit.

“Alright, let’s go back to the private room now,” Xu Jinchen said, then he turned to Song Haoyu and Gu Zichuan. “Don’t forget that you owe us a free meal. Um, it’s not easy for all of us to gather together once. Why don’t we replace the meal with night snacks?”

“Good idea. I agree,” Zi Beiying said.

“Me too,” Gu Ning said.

They were free tonight, so they all agreed.

“Great, whatever you want to have tonight, my treat,” Song Haoyu said.

After that, they went back to the private room.

...

Wu Mina who sat in another private room close by noticed them. She was surprised when she saw Xu Jinchen, because she thought that they were already gone, but they came back.

Therefore, Wu Mina hung up her call at once and walked to them.

Xu Jinchen was displeased. He felt that he was quite unlucky to see Wu Mina again.

“Hi, Jinchen, I thought you left. Why don’t we have fun together in my private room?” Wu Mina invited him with enthusiasm.

“Thanks, Miss Wu, but we’re fine here.” Xu Jinchen politely declined.

It wasn’t surprising, but Wu Mina was unwilling to miss any chance to talk to Xu Jinchen.

“We’re all friends, and we can enjoy ourselves together.” Wu Mina insisted.

“Thanks, but no,” Xu Jinchen said.

“Jinchen, do you really hate me so much?” Wu Mina felt quite disappointed.

“Miss Wu, I don’t hate you. Please don’t get me wrong,” Xu Jinchen said. He lost patience, but he had to be polite to her.

“If you don’t hate me, why do you always refuse to hang out with me? Why do you always stay away from me?” Wu Mina said and sounded aggrieved.

“Well...” Xu Jinchen didn’t know what to say. He had shown his attitude towards Wu Mina very clearly, but Wu Mina didn’t want to give up.

Zi Beiying couldn’t stand it anymore, then stood out staring at Wu Mina. “Miss, did you go to school? Couldn’t you understand what he just said? Let me make it simple, he doesn’t like you.”

“You...” Wu Mina was furious. “Who are you?”

An idea dawned on Zi Beiying and she grabbed Xu Jinchen’s arm and said, “I’m his girlfriend, so you better give up. Don’t try to steal my man from me!”

Xu Jinchen was surprised by Zi Beiying’s actions, but he didn’t stop her because he knew she was helping him.

Although the others were also aware that Zi Beiying was just helping Xu Jinchen out, they somehow felt that they could be a great couple.

Mengda and Nan, as Zi Beiying’s bodyguards, undoubtedly hoped that she could be happy. They felt that Xu Jinchen was a great choice for Zi Beiying too.

“You...” Wu Mina rounded her eyes in shock.

When did Xu Jinchen get a girlfriend? Why didn’t he tell me?

Wu Mina felt like crying. “Jinchen, why didn’t you tell me that you already have a girlfriend?”

It sounded as if Xu Jinchen had cheated her out of her affection towards him.

Xu Jinchen was a little mad when he heard her question. “Miss Wu, it’s my personal affair. Why should I tell you?”
