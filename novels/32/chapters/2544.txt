Chapter 2547: What Can I do?

“What can I do? We can only hope that Jing Jining will keep it a secret,” said Jing Yaorong. He couldn’t send someone to take Jing Jining back right now. It would only make him look guilty if he stopped Jing Jining from seeing Shangguan Yang.

In addition, he didn’t dare to act against Shangguan Yang like that.

As a result, at this moment, Jing Yaorong was irritated.

“Tell your uncle to come to see me,” Jing Yaorong said to Jing Yunyan. He could only use Jing Yanhua to put pressure on Jing Jining now.

“Sure,” said Jing Yunyan, then immediately went to find Jing Yanhua.

When Jing Yunyan walked into the south yard, he found Jing Yanhua. Because of Jing Jining, he was mad and had a bad attitude. “Uncle Yanhua, my father needs to see you.”

Upon seeing Jing Yunyan’s attitude, Jing Yanhua understood that something was wrong, so he asked, “What happened?”

“You’ll know soon,” said Jing Yunyan.

Since Jing Yunyan refused to tell him, Jing Yanhua stopped asking. Like Jing Yunyan said, he would know later.

Therefore, Jing Yanhua followed Jing Yunyan.

In Jing Yaorong’s study, Jing Yanhua asked, “Yaorong, what happened?”

“Do you know that someone called Jing Jining to go out?” Jing Yaorong asked.

“I do. A domestic servant told me that disciples from Tiandaozong came to see him. Isn’t it Tiandaozong that ask to see Jining?” Jing Yanhua said. He thought that it was Tiandaozong that wanted to see Jing Jining.

“Yeah, it was disciples from Tiandaozong that came to call him, but it was actually Shangguan Yang who wanted to see him. Yunyan followed him to Shangguan Yang’s residence, but Shangguan Yang chased him away. It must be Jing Jining’s idea. He wanted to talk with Shangguan Yang about something that will embarrass the Jing family when Yunyan is absent,” said Jing Yaorong, lying that it was Jing Jining’s idea to chase Jing Yunyan away, but that was his suspicion.

“Yanhua, let’s be candid here, you promised that you won’t interfere in the affair with Jing Yunyao. However, if Jing Jining says anything that embarrasses the Jing family, I’m afraid I will have to teach him a lesson.” Jing Yaorong threatened, because he was too angry to control himself right now.

Hearing that, Jing Yanhua was slightly surprised. He hadn’t known that it was Shangguan Yang who wanted to see Jing Jining.

Anyway, he felt that Jing Jining might tell Shangguan Yang about the Jing family’s dirty secret, but he was also clearly aware that it wouldn’t make any difference because he knew Jing Yunyao and her son’s level.

They had Shangguan Yang’s help too, so Jing Yaorong was no match for Jing Yunyao and her son.

“Yaorong, Senior Shangguan chasing Yunyan away might not have anything to do with Jining. If they know that Yunyao has a long-standing grudge against the Jing family, do you think Senior Shangguan would still be willing to meet Yunyan? Besides, Yunyan wasn’t invited, so it was rude. It’s Senior Shangguan’s home. He can chase unwanted guests out! Also I don’t think Senior Shangguan is familiar with Yunyan,” said Jing Yanhua.

Although he believed that Jing Jining would tell Shangguan Yang that the Jing family was aware Jing Yunyao was still alive, he didn’t think it was Jing Jining’s idea to chase Jing Yunyan away. It wouldn’t change the result after all. Jing Jining wouldn’t bother.

“You...” Hearing Jing Yanhua’s reply, Jing Yaorong was angry, because he felt humiliated.

Jing Yanhua was right. If Shangguan Yang learned about Jing Yunyao’s grudge against the Jing family, he wouldn’t welcome Jing Yunyan. And Jing Yunyan wasn’t invited. It was indeed impolite. However, it was still embarrassing that Jing Yunyan was chased away.

Jing Yunyan was also displeased about that. He knew that Jing Yanhua’s words made sense, but he went to Shangguan Yang’s residence to spy on Jing Jining. Therefore, Jing Yunyan argued. “I know it’s impolite that I went to visit Shangguan Yang without an invitation, but I just wanted to stop Cousin Jining from saying something that might damage our family’s reputation. I did it for the Jing family!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Well, you refused to believe in Jining. You’re bothering yourself!” said Jing Yanhua. He understood why they didn’t trust Jing Jining. After all, Jing Jining had a very close relationship with Jing Yunyao.

“Do you think I can believe him? He knew that Jing Yunyao was still alive, but he didn’t tell us. Do you think I should trust him?” Jing Yaorong questioned.

“If not, what do you want to do?” Jing Yanhua asked. He realized that it was impossible to persuade Jing Yaorong to believe Jing Jining, so he stopped arguing.

“Send someone to bring Jing Jining back. Just tell him that you need to talk with him about something important. I’ll ask him what he did afterwards,” said Jing Yaorong.

“Fine!” Jing Yanhua agreed.

After that, Jing Yanhua left and sent someone to find Jing Jining at Shangguan Yang’s residence.

However, at this moment, Jing Jining wasn’t in Shangguan Yang’s residence, but at Tiandaozong. Therefore, Jing Yanhua’s man waited at the foot of Tiandaozong for Jing Jining.

Jing Jining, Shangguan Yang, and Gu Ning had dinner at Tiandaozong, then climbed down the mountain. Shangguan Yang and Gu Ning didn’t plan to stay in the cultivation world tonight, so they would leave right away.

Jing Jining decided to stay, because he was worried that Jing Yaorong might make things difficult for his parents if he left.

Bai Lingtian wanted to walk Shangguan Yang out in person, but Shangguan Yang declined, so Bai Lingtian stopped at the gate of Tiandaozong.

Because Jing Jining was with Shangguan Yang, Bai Lingtian didn’t insist. After watching Shangguan Yang and the others disappear from his sight, Bai Lingtian returned to his place.

From afar, Jing Jining saw his father’s henchman at the foot of the mountain. He immediately figured it out. It must be Jing Yunyan who reported his visit to Shangguan Yang to Jing Yaorong and then forced his father to bring him back.

“Honored to see you, Senior Shangguan.” When Shangguan Yang and the others approached, Jing Yanhua’s subordinate greeted Shangguan Yang respectfully.

“Hi,” said Shangguan Yang.

Then the man said to Jing Jining, “Lord, master needs to talk with you about something important. Please go home right away.”
