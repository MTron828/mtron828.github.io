Chapter 2331: Jiang Shuyuan’s in Bad Health

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia, however, avoided seeing them. Leng Yuanqian also kept his distance from them as usual, but they talked once in a while.

He was a mature man after all, and wasn’t as mean as Jiang Shuyuan. Although he never liked Leng Shaoting, he didn’t forget his manners when they were in the same room.

After the meal, Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia went upstairs, while the other people chatted in the living room.

When Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia left, Jing Yunyao said to Leng Yuanqian, “Yuanqian, if it’s possible, tell Shuyuan to have a medical check in the hospital.”

Jing Yunyao said that because she could see that Jiang Shuyuan was in bad health. Although Jing Yunyao didn’t know about medicines, she could see whether a person was in good health.

Although Jing Yunyao didn’t get along with Jiang Shuyuan, she was willing to help if Jiang Shuyuan was in a bad condition. She could see that Jiang Shuyuan wasn’t well, so she decided to remind Leng Yuanqian to pay more attention to Jiang Shuyuan.

Everyone was surprised and Leng Yuanqian anxiously asked, “Do you mean Shuyuan is ill?”

He wasn’t mad at Jing Yunyao for saying that Jiang Shuyuan was in bad health. He was simply astonished. In addition, he had no reason to doubt Jing Yunyao’s words, because Jiang Shuyuan was his wife. They slept together and he had noticed that Jing Yunyao couldn’t sleep well recently. However, it wasn’t too serious, so he didn’t think that she was physically ill.

He had asked her whether she felt uncomfortable, but Jiang Shuyuan denied it. She only said that she couldn’t sleep well, so he didn’t pay much attention to that.

“Yeah, but you better not tell her that I told you, or she’ll refuse to have a medical check,” said Jing Yunyao.

Jiang Shuyuan hated Jing Yunyao after all, and would certainly act against anything Jing Yunyao said.

Although it was none of Jing Yunyao’s business, she hoped that Jiang Shuyuan could have a medical check so she reminded Leng Yuanqian about that. For Master Leng’s sake, Jiang Shuyuan should stop harboring the grudge between them.

“I know.” Leng Yuanqian said and thanked her. “Thanks, Yunyao.”

Jing Yunyao did it out of kindness, so he had to be polite and show his gratitude.

After that, Leng Shaoting and the others left.

…

Jing Yunyao’s kindness also impressed Master Leng and other members of the Leng family.

Even though Jiang Shuyuan was very bad towards Jing Yunyao, Jing Yunyao still reminded Leng Yuanqian to care more about Jiang Shuyuan. If Jiang Shuyuan learned about that, would she be grateful? Would she change her attitude and get along with Jing Yunyao afterwards?

After Leng Shaoting and the others were gone, Leng Yuanqian went back to his room.

In the room, he said to Jiang Shuyuan, “I haven’t felt well recently. Why don’t we go to have a medical check together in the hospital tomorrow? You don’t sleep well these days either.”

Leng Yuanqian was worried that Jiang Shuyuan might think too much if he directly told her to have a medical check, so he made up an excuse.

“Have you been working too hard?” Upon hearing that Leng Yuanqian didn’t feel well, Jiang Shuyuan asked with concern.

Jiang Shuyuan wasn’t a nice person, but she cared about her husband and kids.

“Yeah, I’m indeed stressed,” said Leng Yuanqian.

“Sure, I’ll go with you tomorrow. I can have a medical check too.” Jiang Shuyuan didn’t think much and agreed.

Although Jiang Shuyuan didn’t feel uncomfortable anywhere, she was willing to do a medical check since she was going to the hospital with Leng Yuanqian tomorrow.

…

After Gu Ning and the others left the Leng family’s house, they went back to the siheyuan.

Leng Shaoting really wanted to have some private time with Gu Ning, but it was late. It would be about 11:30 pm after sending Jing Yunyao back to the siheyuan. If they still went out at this time, it would be too late, so Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning decided to stay in the siheyuan tonight.

After arriving at the siheyuan, Gu Ning chatted with the others for a while before she went to cultivate.

She just broke through to the next level, and needed time to stabilize it.

When Gu Ning went to cultivate, Leng Shaoting stayed by her side.

The next day.

Because Gu Ning was going back to City B today, she went to her company that morning and told Chen Cangyi that she was leaving.

Leng Yuanqian took Jiang Shuyuan to have a medical check in the hospital. Due to their high status, they didn’t wait long for the result.

Leng Yuanqian was healthy, but there was indeed a problem with Jiang Shuyuan’s body.

She had myelodysplasia.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were a group of heterogeneous myeloid clonal diseases originating from hematopoietic stem cells, characterized by abnormal differentiation and development of myeloid cells, manifested as ineffective hematopoiesis, refractory cytopenia, hematopoietic failure, and high-risk Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation.

There were no obvious leukemia lesions, but there was a trend, and changes would occur within a short period of time if there was no surprise.

There weren’t pathological changes yet, so it wasn’t difficult to cure. If there were, it would become hard.

Hearing the result, both Leng Yuanqian and Jiang Shuyuan were shocked. They didn’t expect that Jiang Shuyuan was really ill.

At this moment, Leng Yuanqian felt more grateful for Jing Yunyao’s kindness. If it hadn’t been for her, they wouldn’t have found out about the illness until it got a lot worse.

Jiang Shuyuan didn’t know it was because of Jing Yunyao that Leng Yuanqian took her to have a medical check in the hospital. She only felt grateful that they found out before it became serious.

Back in their home, Leng Yuanqian told Master Leng, and Master Leng was shocked too.

Since Jing Shuyuan was ill, she had to be treated.

Master Leng called Jing Yunyao at once and told her the result of Jiang Shuyuan’s medical check. He also thanked her for her kindness.

Jing Yunyao didn’t care about that too much, but neither she nor Gu Ning would treat Jiang Shuyuan.

It wasn’t a serious disease, and Jiang Shuyuan could be treated in the hospital. Gu Ning would only help her if she had serious cancer.

It wasn’t a bad thing for Jiang Shuyuan to be taught a lesson in the hospital.

…

At 1 pm, after they had lunch and rested for a while, Leng Shaoting drove Gu Ning to the airport.

Gu Ning flew to City B at 2:40 pm.

Separation was always sad. Even if Gu Ning didn’t go back to City B, Leng Shaoting had to go back to the military base that afternoon. In other words, they had to separate. No matter how unwilling they were to leave each other, Leng Shaoting could only watch Gu Ning disappear from sight.

Myelodysplasia is a rare type of blood cancer..
