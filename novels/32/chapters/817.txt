819 I Will Pay You Back!

“I just had sympathy for her, but it turns out that she’s the evil one!”

...

Some onlookers showed dislike towards Gu Ning, but some also believed that Gu Ning had done it for a reason.

Gu Ning, however, didn’t care about their looks. “Miss Zheng, it seems that you didn’t learn anything from what you’ve done. If you hadn’t attacked me first that day, I wouldn’t have broken your wrist by accident.”

“As for your mother, she also wanted to hurt me, so I avoided it on time, and she fell down on the ground by herself. Did you expect me to stand still so that your mother could hit me? I’m not dumb.”

“You...” Zheng Wenmei got angry, but didn’t know how to retort. Gu Ning hadn’t broken her wrist by accident, but on purpose!

Onlookers turned to support Gu Ning now.

“Oh, Miss Zheng tried to attack the girl first!”

“Her mother also wanted to hurt the girl. Only idiots would stand there to be beaten.”

“You’re right. Miss Zheng is so shameless.”

“She’s brought shame on her family.”

“Exactly!”

Hearing their discussion, Zheng Wenmei was displeased. “You broke my wrist on purpose!”

“So what? You tried to attack me first, so I fought back,” Gu Ning sneered. Not only was Zheng Wenmei very rude, but she was also malicious, which was unacceptable in Gu Ning’s eyes.

“You asked for it yourself!” Cao Wenxin said to support Gu Ning.

“That’s because you grabbed the store away, which my mother and I wanted to rent!” Zheng Wenmei argued again.

Hearing that, the crowd was confused, and didn’t know whose fault it was. They turned to look at Gu Ning to hear her explanation.

“Interesting! You didn’t make up your mind to rent the store, and you don’t have the right to keep the manager waiting for your decision!” Gu Ning said.

“You...” Zheng Wenmei flushed red with embarrassment.

Seeing that, the crowd chose to believe Gu Ning’s words.

“They didn’t make their decision, so the store isn’t theirs.”

“I think the manager has the right to rent out the store to anyone.”

“I agree. Miss Zheng is so shameless.”

...

“You...” Zheng Wenmei had to show her family background right now to win the argument. “You can’t criticize me. I was born in the Zheng family, that is the owner of the Hetian Group!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hearing that, the onlookers closed their mouths at once. No matter how much they disliked her, they didn’t dare to say a word now.

Gu Ning, however, wasn’t afraid of her family at all. “To be honest with you, your older brother has already paid me the compensation for the damages he caused my store.”

What?

Hearing that, let alone those onlookers, even Zheng Wenmei was shocked.

The crowd was shocked by the fact that the Zheng family had damaged Gu Ning’s store, and that Gu Ning was able to get the compensation, which proved that Gu Ning wasn’t a simple girl.

Zheng Wenmei was shocked, because her older brother had kept it a secret from her that he had paid the compensation after damaging the store. She couldn’t accept it.

Seeing Zheng Wenmei’s reaction, Gu Ning realized that she probably wasn’t aware of it.

“Wenmei, I don’t think we have the ability to mess with her. Let’s go now. We can find a chance to teach her a lesson next time.”

Zheng Wenmei’s friend was a little scared of Gu Ning now and wanted to leave.

Although Zheng Wenmei was rude and arrogant, she wasn’t dumb, so she listened to her friend.

“Let’s see. I will pay you back!”

In the end, Zheng Wenmei left in anger after threatening Gu Ning. Gu Ning wasn’t injured at all, so she also walked away with Cao Wenxin.

“Why do I somehow feel that the girl looks so familiar? I think I’ve seen her somewhere before,” a boy suddenly said after Gu Ning was gone.

“Forget it! You say that every time you want to strike up a conversation with a beautiful girl. She’s already gone,” another boy said with disdain.

“I didn’t say that because I want to strike up a conversation with her. She’s already gone after all, but I do think she looks familiar.” the boy insisted. He really thought that Gu Ning looked familiar.

“Well, you’ve probably met her somewhere before,” another boy said.

“If I’ve met her somewhere before, I would have remembered her face clearly because she’s so gorgeous,” the boy said.

“Oh, isn’t she Goddess Gu?” another friend who was also a boy said with surprise.

“Right! She is Goddess Gu! OMG, I didn’t remember that just then,” the boy got excited too.

“Who is Goddess Gu?” a boy asked.

“You don’t know her?” The other boys showed disdain towards him after hearing that.
