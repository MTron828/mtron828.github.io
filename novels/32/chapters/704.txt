Chapter 705 Black Cat

Since the man could recognize them, he must have the same occupation as them. If he came to them right now, he must have been assigned a task to kill them. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Are you here to kill us?” Gao Yi asked, although he already had the answer. Even though their names weren’t on the wanted list now, it was possible that the leader of the killer organization they had served wanted them killed.

“Not really.” To Gao Yi and Qiao Ya’s astonishment, the man denied it.

“Then why?” Gao Yi asked with a doubtful look.

“Well,” the man said in a self-mocking tone. “I’m on the wanted list now the same as you were, but I’m not as able as you are to be able to wipe my name away, so I’m being chased now.”

Hearing that, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya frowned, and were curious about the reason why his name was listed on the wanted list. Normally, the killers whose names were put on the wanted list had betrayed their organizations. One killer wouldn’t put another killer’s name on the wanted list, because they preferred to solve the problem on their own. Although they were curious, they didn’t ask for the reason, because curiosity killed the cat.

“How did you find us and why?” Gao Yi asked again.

“I encountered you just now, and of course I want you to help me wipe my name from the wanted list. I’ll owe you a favor, and I’ll do everything for you to the best of my ability,” the man said.

“Sorry, we don’t have the ability to wipe our names away; someone helped us,” Gao Yi said.

“Who?” the man asked.

“Shouldn’t you tell me whether you’re telling me the truth first? I can’t tell you the person’s name right now,” Gao Yi said.

The man was struck dumb for a second. He thought that Gao Yi’s words made sense, so he took off his cap and mask. A young face with a knife scar appeared.

“Black Cat!”

Seeing the man’s face, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya were surprised to meet a familiar person. Their names had been on the wanted list, so it was normal that other killers knew their faces and code names, but they were still astonished to see a familiar face.

In the killers’ world, their identities had to be kept a secret, so one wouldn’t know many familiar people, unless they served the same organization, or had met each other at the same training place, or had fought against one another while fulfilling the same task.

They met Black Cat in a conflict when they had been assigned the same task. Although they had almost killed each other, they had fulfilled the task with one another’s help, so they had shared the reward at the end.

“If you don’t believe it, you can check the wanted list. I can wait,” Black Cat said.

“Well, it’s not up to me whether to help you or not, and I think that you will have to satisfy the conditions she set,” Gao Yi said, because he knew that Gu Ning wouldn’t agree without any conditions.

“What conditions?” Black Cat asked. He didn’t think that it was a big deal, because there was no free lunch in this world.

“You will probably have to work for her for the rest of your life ,” Gao Yi said.

Hearing that, Black Cat frowned. What was the difference between that and his previous life in the killer organization?

“Well, we’re willing to work for her for the rest of our lives, but it still depends on her whether she wants to use you. I can only say that she’s a very successful businesswoman who’s never done illegal things,” Gao Yi said. He understood that Black Cat was reluctant to live a life which was full of blood and killing anymore.

He wasn’t sure whether Gu Ning would help Black Cat, but he had to know Black Cat’s willingness before he told Gu Ning.

Gao Yi was willing to give Black Cat a helping hand because he thought that Black Cat was a great killer, and Gu Ning probably needed him. As for Black Cat’s character, Gao Yi didn’t know much about it, and it was up to Gu Ning whether to keep him or not.

“If it is possible, I hope that I can discuss it with her in person,” Black Cat said.

“I can help you mention it on the phone, but she’s the decision-maker,” Gao Yi said, and Black Cat understood. Afterwards, Gao Yi walked aside, and called Gu Ning.

When Gu Ning received Gao Yi’s call, she had just finished the meal with her friends, and they were talking about where to have fun next.

“Boss, I have something to talk to you in private,” Gao Yi heard other people’s voices from the phone and said.

Hearing that, Gu Ning cocked her eyebrow, because she knew that it must be serious.

“Wait a second,” Gu Ning said standing up, then walked to an interior room.“Alright, you can say it now,” Gu Ning said.

After that, Gao Yi told her what had happened to Black Cat.

Hearing that, Gu Ning’s eyes lit up. She needed people with great skills in fighting or kung fu right now, and a killer couldn’t be a better choice! As for the person’s character, she needed time to see it. Therefore, she didn’t mind. In addition, she was also willing to meet Black Cat in person, and told them to meet her at the Huangdeng Hotel.

When Gu Ning walked out, they already made a decision on where to have fun next, but Gu Ning had to leave. “I’m sorry. I have to go deal with something important right now, so I won’t join you.”

They were all disappointed that Gu Ning would be absent, but they understood that Gu Ning was very busy.

Since Gu Ning wouldn’t go with them, Leng Shaoting wouldn’t either. They went to a tea room after their friends were gone.

Leng Shaoting didn’t ask what Gu Ning was going to deal with, but clasped her in his arms the second the waiter was out. He lowered his head to her neck, and rubbed her collarbone with the top of his nose.

“Stop now. They’ll be here soon.” Gu Ning pushed Leng Shaoting away. They were in a public place!
