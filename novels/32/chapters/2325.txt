Chapter 2328: The Wind Is Gone

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

He honestly didn’t know whom to choose if it happened in reality.

No matter who he chose, he would hurt the other, and there wouldn’t be a complete Gu Ning if either of them was absent.

He wouldn’t stop loving Gu Ning even if she was incomplete, but the condition was that the other incomplete Gu Ning didn’t exist.

After that, Leng Shaoting told Gu Ning about his conversation with Tang Aining and Gu Ning in the illusion. Gu Ning felt a little uneasy when she heard the whole story.

In fact, she was willing to admit that she possessed Gu Ning’s body after Tang Aining died. After all, she never planned to keep it a secret from Leng Shaoting forever, and she had already told Shangguan Yang about that.

She just hadn’t told Leng Shaoting yet. Since he was aware of that now, she thought that she could tell him everything about it.

However, because she didn’t know whether Leng Shaoting would be bothered by it, she lacked confidence. After a deep breath, she finally opened her mouth. “It’s true that my soul possessed Gu Ning’s body after I died as Tang Aining. I told you that I took revenge for Tang Aining, but it’s actually for myself. I didn’t know how to explain it to you back then, so I lied and said that Tang Aining is my master. I met you a few days after my reincarnation. Do you mind?”

“I don’t mind it at all. I’m just scared that it might happen in our real life. I don’t know what I’d do then,” said Leng Shaoting, sounding a little aggrieved.

He was a strong man. He had never been scared of facing danger before.

Before Gu Ning successfully became a cultivator, he had to face her early death while he would stay young forever, but he still decided to die with her and leave his mother who he just met. However, what happened to him this time was really a problem for him.

Leng Shaoting soon accepted the fact that Gu Ning’s body was actually possessed by Tang Aining’s soul. As a cultivator, he had witnessed many unbelievable things.

Knowing that Leng Shaoting wasn’t bothered by that, Gu Ning felt relieved. She wasn’t worried that it might happen in reality, so she comforted Leng Shaoting. “Relax, it won’t happen in reality. When I successfully became a cultivator, my soul was completely integrated with Gu Ning’s body. We won’t separate.”

“Really?” Leng Shaoting’s face lit up. If so, it would be for the best.

“Of course! In fact, our master is already aware of it. Because he could see that my body and my soul belong to different people, I told him the secret. Master said I have the Blood of the Phoenix, so it should be easy for me to become a cultivator. I just need to mix my soul with my body so that I can cultivate. So I didn’t begin to cultivate until my soul mixed with my body,” said Gu Ning.

After hearing that, Leng Shaoting was more relieved.

When Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting had almost reached the entrance of the cave, Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting to let her down. She used her Jade Eyes to look outside, and she could see that Xu Jinchen and the others were still there.

If they saw Leng Shaoting carrying her on his back, they would think that she was injured and would be worried about her.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were actually a little surprised that Xu Jinchen and the others were still waiting for them outside. They had disappeared for so long. Why didn’t they look worried?

Gu Ning had that thought, not because Xu Jinchen and the others didn’t seem worried, but because she thought that they should be worried after they had disappeared for so long. Therefore, an idea dawned on Gu Ning. Was the time different after they entered the illusion?

Thinking of that, Gu Ning took out her phone and glanced at the time.

She was right. Although she had stayed in the illusion for nearly a day, only an hour had passed outside. Obviously, a day in the illusion was an hour in reality.

If so, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting weren’t worried.

It was the truth. Although Gu Ning had stayed in the illusion for almost a day, only an hour had passed in the outside world. Therefore, Xu Jinchen and the others were slightly anxious, but they could stay calm and didn’t leave.

“Hey, you’re out. How is it? Is anything wrong inside?”

Seeing Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting come out, Xu Jinchen and the others were relieved.

“Nothing abnormal, but it’s indeed not safe inside. I think we better block this entrance with stones,” said Leng Shaoting. He wouldn’t tell what he had been through in the cave. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Hearing that, Xu Jinchen and the others agreed.

“Do we need to do that by ourselves or leave it to the staff of this scenic spot?” Xu Jinchen asked. Even if the scenic spot should be responsible for that, they might not be reliable, so Xu Jinchen asked Leng Shaoting about that.

“You can go out before us. Guard ten meters away. Ningning and I will deal with it,” said Leng Shaoting.

“Sure!”

Xu Jinchen and the others agreed, then walked away. They knew that Leng Shaoting could handle it well.

Once they were gone, Leng Shaoting let the flood dragon out and told it to block the entrance of the cave.

There were many stones and the entrance wasn’t large, so it wasn’t difficult. Within a short time, it was done.

Instantly, the wind was gone on that path.

Xu Jinchen and the others could also feel it from ten meters away. Although they were aware of Leng Shaoting’s and Gu Ning’s abilities, they were still amazed by their efficiency.

Zi Beiying was especially shocked. “Jesus, they’re so fast!”

“They’re always more efficient than other people.” Xu Jinchen was surprised, but felt more proud of them.

“You’re not as efficient as them. Why are you so proud?” Zi Beiying rolled her eyes at Xu Jinchen.

“Leng Shaoting is my boss!” Xu Jinchen wasn’t affected at all. He admired Leng Shaoting, and didn’t feel jealous of him at all.

Several visitors who climbed up the mountain for the wind suddenly felt the wind was gone halfway. It aroused their doubts.

“What happened? I just felt the wind, but it’s suddenly gone.”

“Right, the breeze can’t be the so-called strong wind!”

“I think it might be a lie that there is an abnormally strong wind..”
