Chapter 2319: Sure, I’ll Go with You

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

It sounded so unbelievable that Leng Shaoting could barely believe it, but Gu Ning just proved it right in front of him.

Gu Ning continued. “After we meet a few times by chance, we’ll begin to interact with each other. Then we fall in love and become boyfriend and girlfriend.”

They would fall in love?

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting looked at Gu Ning with mixed emotions, but he had no affection for her. After all, she was only a stranger in his eyes now. Instead, he felt a little embarrassed.

At this time, he couldn’t imagine that he would fall in love with a girl.

“I know you can’t believe my words, but I know everything about you. I won’t talk about your family background. It isn’t a secret, and doesn’t mean anything. There is something about that and not many people know it. I know you’re the chairman of the Shengshi Organization. Only your grandfather is aware of that. Other family members of yours don’t know it.”

“I also know the names of your comrades. They are Xu Jinchen, Chen Meng, Si Ming, Ai Weishun…”

Gu Ning said the names of Leng Shaoting’s comrades, and Leng Shaoting became more and more surprised.

Only a very few people were aware of that.

“Your mother, Yunyao, loves ancient yards, so your father built Xiaoyao Mountain Villa for your mother.”

“I also know about the Singapore munitioner, the Zi family. I know Zi Shaomin and Zi Beiying, and I also know…”

Gu Ning said many things that only Leng Shaoting or people who were close to him could be aware of. It was nearly impossible for outsiders to know that.

Was what she said true? If not, how did she manage to know all of this about him?

Looking at the serious expression on Gu Ning’s face, he didn’t think she was lying.

“After we’ve been together for more than a year, we meet each other’s family. Although we’re not officially engaged, we believe that we’re going to marry. We introduced ourselves as a couple to other people. Therefore, I have a key to your house, and I got in with it. In fact, I also have the key to Mid-Levels Mansion and the siheyuan.”

Saying that, Gu Ning took out the key and showed it to Leng Shaoting.

At this time, Leng Shaoting was more shocked than ever and didn’t know what to do. However, he didn’t interrupt Gu Ning, and let her continue. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Actually, your mother isn’t dead.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting couldn’t stay calm any longer. He immediately asked, “What? My mother isn’t dead?”

“Right, but she lost her memories after the accident happened that year. She’s been living at the foot of Kunlun Mountain. By chance, we’ll find her and help her get her memories back. In fact, your mother is a cultivator. Although she was seriously injured and was about to die that year, she was rescued afterwards. She lost her memories, so she couldn’t come back to see you. You inherited her cultivator’s blood, so you’re also a cultivator. You just need some time,” said Gu Ning.

“My mother is a cultivator. I’m also a cultivator?” Leng Shaoting could hardly believe it. It was difficult for him to accept it.

He knew what a cultivator was, but he had only seen them on TV before.

It was normally a role in fantasy novels, and he couldn’t believe that cultivators really existed. In addition, both his mother and he were cultivators.

“Right, and I’m actually a cultivator too. We have the same master. His name is Shangguan Yang,” said Gu Ning.

Leng Shaoting received too much shocking news at a time, so he didn’t know what to do all of a sudden.

After a while, Leng Shaoting asked, “Since you said we’ll meet in a month and so many things will happen afterwards. Why did we meet right now?”

“That’s the ultimate purpose of my coming to you today. Xu Jingchen heard rumors of a strange hole in Xianyun Mountain from Xu Jinglin. It’s said that there is a strong wind inside, which can blow people down. After we heard, we were worried. There might be monsters or ghosts, so we went to have a look. Because we’re cultivators, we are able to keep going against the wind, then we reach a barrier. At first, we threw stuff at the barrier, but it bounced back. I even joke that the barrier could be a time-traveling tunnel or something, and we stop touching it. Because we’re worried that accidents might happen, we turned around and walked away. However, right as we turned around, we were absorbed by a powerful force. After I woke up, I found that I traveled about a year back in time. I’m back in my own body now,” Gu Ning said.

“I decided to find you first, and we can go to Xianyun Mountain together. I want to see whether we can go back to our life through that barrier. If we disappear just like that, our life in a year might not exist. Even if it still exists, our families and friends will be worried about us,” said Gu Ning feeling very sad. She even cried.

Because Leng Shaoting didn’t know Gu Ning yet, he felt nothing when Gu Ning told him that they were actually a couple. However, he somehow felt sorry for her when she cried.

“Sure, I’ll go with you.” Leng Shaoting agreed. He didn’t bother to think about the result or whether Gu Ning lied to him.

In fact, Leng Shaoting was mostly convinced by Gu Ning, so he wanted to know whether what she said was true.

If Gu Ning told the truth and he could go back to his life in a year, he would be willing to go with her.

Gu Ning’s face lit up when Leng Shaoting agreed. She said in a hurry, “Let’s go there right now. There won’t be visitors at night, and we can take action.”

Leng Shaoting nodded, so he drove Gu Ning to Xianyun Mountain.

Along the way, they barely talked. After all, they were strangers now, and honestly didn’t know what to say in addition to serious matters.

In fact, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning wanted to talk with each other. Gu Ning hoped that Leng Shaoting could remember her by finding out more of what had happened between them. However, he wasn’t the Leng Shaoting she knew right now, and he had no affection for her. She was worried that he might hate her if she talked with him about their story.

Leng Shaoting, on the other hand, actually wanted to ask Gu Ning about what would happen between them. He also wanted to see whether he would remember her, but the condition was that he really traveled a year back in time.

After thinking about it for a while, he felt it might be a little sensitive. He didn’t want to make Gu Ning more upset. Therefore, neither of them said anything..
