Chapter 2857: I Have Enough Money

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Let’s bet whether there is jade among these three raw jade materials. If there isn’t, I’ll give you five million yuan. If there is, your contract with him will be invalid. What do you think?” said Gu Ning.

Hearing that, everyone was surprised.

What? Five million yuan?

Was there really jade in those raw jade materials?

No, it was impossible. No one believed that Gu Ning could do that, but why did she dare to say that? Was she too rich to care about losing some money?

They believed that might be the answer. No matter what, they refused to believe that there was jade among the three raw jade materials.

“She’s crazy!”

“I think she’s too rich to care about losing some money.”

“Jesus, why can’t I have that chance?”

“Yeah, if I had that chance, I could easily get five million yuan.”

“…”

“Young girl, no need to do that.” Jiang Wenliang immediately stopped Gu Ning. He was a little mad at her impulse. It wouldn’t do her any good.

Before Jiang Wenliang finished, Jiang Dashun interrupted. “Great, let’s have a bet, but words aren’t enough. We need to sign an agreement.”

Jiang Dashun was afraid that Gu Ning would deny it after she lost since he was certain that she was doomed to fail.

Actually, Gu Ning had the same worry, so she was more than happy to sign an agreement with Jiang Dashun.

“No problem.” Gu Ning agreed with alacrity.

Afterwards, Jiang Dashun found a pen and a piece of paper to write down the agreement.

“Young girl. Don’t be so impulsive! Why are you giving him so much money?” Jiang Wenliang criticized Gu Ning. He was grateful for Gu Ning’s kindness, but it was a wrong decision in his eyes.

Gu Ning walked closer and put on a confident smile. “Don’t worry, I won’t lose. If you can buy these three raw jade materials, the jade inside will be yours.”

Although Gu Ning could gamble with Jiang Dashun on her own and return the ancient house to Jiang Wenliang after she won, she was in a good mood and wanted to give the jade to Jiang Wenliang. There was no reason for that. She simply wanted to see whether Jiang Wenliang dared to gamble.

“But…” Jiang Wenliang wanted to say that it was impossible to cut jade from the three raw jade materials, but Gu Ning was determined to help him, so he didn’t want to hurt her. “I don’t have money now.”

He was really out of money. He barely had a hundred yuan in his pocket, let alone over a thousand yuan.

If he had money… If he had enough money, he wouldn’t take that risk, because he would lose everything.

In fact, if he had a lot of money, he wouldn’t have fallen into trouble now.

“I can lend you the money. If you lose, I don’t need you to pay me back. If you win, you can pay me back then,” said Gu Ning.

Hearing that, everyone was surprised. Jiang Wenliang had unbelievably good luck today. Whether he won or lost, he wouldn’t suffer any loss.

“Am I dreaming?”

“I can’t believe my ears either. If it’s not a dream, then hell is frozen over right now.”

“It’s unbelievable!”

“Young girl, why do you have to do that? I don’t think I deserve your unconditional help.” Jiang Wenliang was really touched, but he still couldn’t accept Gu Ning’s help.

“Don’t be afraid. I’m wealthy,” said Gu Ning.

Everyone was surprised and felt heavily hit.

They didn’t understand rich people’s world.

Fang Lin was furious at this moment. She couldn’t believe that Jiang Wenliang could be so lucky today. A rich girl suddenly jumped out to help him!

Although she thought that Gu Ning must be crazy, she was willing to see Gu Ning lose a fortune. If Gu Ning lost, they could make a lot of money.

Jiang Dashun had millions of yuan in assets, but most of it was in fixed annuities like houses, so five million yuan was a lot. It was already enough to make them jealous.

“Anyway, I’ve reached an agreement with Jiang Dashun. Now it’s not your own issue. Even if you don’t agree, I still need to gamble with him. I am not doing this just for you; I simply hate his behavior and want to teach him a lesson. But I can be honest with you. You won’t lose anything as long as you trust me,” said Gu Ning.

Gu Ning said that in order to not burden Jiang Wenliang.

“I won’t lose anything, but you will. I’m not a saint, but I know I don’t deserve your unconditional help,” said Jiang Wenliang.

In that case, Jiang Wenliang was an upright man.

“Just take it as a little favor. You just said that you’re not a saint. Since you’re not, you sometimes need help. Don’t tell me you have never accepted any help from anyone throughout your life. I won’t believe it,” said Gu Ning. She was persuading Jiang Wenliang to accept it, because he wouldn’t accept the jade if he didn’t agree right now.

“I…” Jiang Wenliang was struck dumb for a moment and didn’t know what to say. Although Gu Ning’s words made sense, he still felt he didn’t deserve it.

“Don’t you want your ancient house back?” asked Gu Ning.

“I…” Jiang Wenliang felt like changing his mind. He obviously wanted his ancient house back. After all, it stored stories of his family’s generations.

“Come on, be a man. I hate indecisive men the most.” Gu Ning was mad that Jiang Wenliang was still hesitating.

She wasn’t really mad, but she wanted to force Jiang Wenliang to accept.

“Fine, I accept. If I win, I only want my ancient house back. I don’t want other things,” said Jiang Wenliang. He would be satisfied if his ancient house could be returned to him.

Other people, however, thought he was dumb.

Although they didn’t think that there was jade in the raw jade materials, what if there really was?

On the other hand, some people were still amazed by his merit. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Gu Ning smiled and said nothing. Since he agreed, it wasn’t up to him whether he took the jade or not.

At this time, Jiang Dashun finished the agreement.

“Young girl, the agreement is done. Now sign your name on it. You asked for it by yourself. Don’t regret it.” Jiang Dashun urged, in case Gu Ning regretted doing it.

After all, it was five million yuan!

“I surely won’t regret it,” said Gu Ning. Then she took the agreement. After making sure it was right, she signed her name on it and each of them took a copy.
