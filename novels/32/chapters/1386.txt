Chapter 1389: Help Me

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I-I didn’t know about it until I read the news just then. How could I know that he would take action on that day? I would have stopped him if I had known!” Leng Shaojia argued.

“What? How could you do such a thing?” Leng Shaoming was shocked and couldn’t believe that his younger sister was so cruel and evil.

“I...” Leng Shaojia didn’t know how to defend herself now.

“How did you get to know the killer? Does he know who you are?” Leng Shaoming asked.

It already happened, so it was useless to criticize Leng Shaojia now. Luckily, no one was killed in the car accident. They had to make sure that no one else would find out.

“A friend of mine in Country Y helped me, and the killer doesn’t know who I am,” Leng Shaojia said. She believed that she could hide herself very well.

“Really? Do you think you’re safe by doing that?” Leng Shaoming mocked. He didn’t think that it was a perfect plan.

Even though Leng Shaojia had a friend to help her hire the killer, it was possible that the killer could betray her or her friend.

As long as Leng Shaoting found out about Leng Shaojia’s friend, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to find her out. Therefore, Leng Shaoming was worried that Leng Shaoting might have already found Leng Shaojia out.

However, he was confused about why Leng Shaoting still did nothing.

It was probably because they were a family, that Leng Shaoting couldn’t punish them right away. And probably because Gu Ning was fine, that Leng Shaoting decided not to mention it. Anyway, it wasn’t a good thing that Leng Shaoting had found Leng Shaojia out. The situation was totally out of control now.

“What should we do now?” Both Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia were scared.

They were reluctant to mess with Leng Shaoting, because Leng Shaoting was much more important than them in the Leng family. If Leng Shaoting knew that Leng Shaojia was guilty, he wouldn’t let her get away with it.

Leng Shaojia didn’t know what would happen to her in the future, so she was scared.

“I don’t know,” Leng Shaoming said with a resigned look. If Leng Shaoting was involved in this, he honestly had no idea how to handle it. If Leng Shaoting found out and wanted to punish them, nobody could stop him.

Leng Shaoming was only sure that Leng Shaoting wouldn’t kill Leng Shaojia because they were a family.

Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia remained silent. Neither of them knew what to do now.

An idea dawned on Leng Shaoming that Leng Shaojia’s painful waist might have something to do with Leng Shaoting or Gu Ning.

Leng Shaoming had that idea because it happened right after the car accident. It was only his guess, but he thought that it was highly possible.

If he was right, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were already kind enough.

“Shaoming, do something for your younger sister. Leng Shaoting likes Gu Ning very much. If he finds out, he won’t hesitate to get revenge on Shaojia.” Jiang Shuyuan was in sheer panic.

Leng Shaoting had warned her before, and she didn’t forget his warning. Leng Shaojia was already in great pain now, so she didn’t want her to suffer more.

“Shaoming, help me!” Leng Shaojia begged Leng Shaoming in fear.

Leng Shaoming wanted to help her, but he didn’t know what to do now either.

“Even if Leng Shaoting finds out, he won’t kill Shaojia, because we’re a family after all. He won’t be too cruel for the sake of grandfather,” Leng Shaoming said. He wouldn’t avoid it, and would choose to face it.

“What? Shaojia is already in pain now. Do you want to see her suffer more?” Jiang Shuyuan snapped at Leng Shaoming.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoming was displeased. “Didn’t she think of the result when she decided to do that? Shouldn’t she pay for what she has done? Don’t forget that what she has done is illegal!”

“She could be put in jail, and her target is Gu Ning, not Leng Shaoting. If Gu Ning knows that she’s the mastermind and that it has nothing to do with Leng Shaoting and the Leng family, Gu Ning might directly sue her, which will be worse.”

Although Leng Shaoming was also a selfish man, he wouldn’t play dirty tricks when he was competing with Leng Shaoting.

He disliked what his mother and younger sister had done to Gu Ning before and he had tried to stop them, but they wouldn’t listen to him. Leng Shaoting wasn’t affected either. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

However, what Leng Shaojia had done this time totally annoyed Leng Shaoming, so he couldn’t stay calm now when he faced her, even though she was his younger sister.
