Chapter 690 Why Don’t We Do It in the Car?

Zhao Xiaoxuan was in a terrible mood because neither Mrs. Lin nor Lin Tianyou called her back. One of her female friends called her and said that she had just broken up with her boyfriend and invited her to have fun together, Zhao Xiaoxuan agreed since she also wanted to drown her sorrows.

Zhao Xiaoxuan cared about her appearance very much, and dressed herself up before she went out to meet her friend. Although Zhao Xiaoxuan wasn’t a gorgeous beauty, she wasn’t ugly either, and also looked attractive because of her good body shape.

Mrs. Zhao didn’t stop Zhao Xiaoxuan from hanging out with her friends. Besides, she was in a bad mood today, so Mrs. Zhao wouldn’t say anything except to remind her to be careful.

The weather was getting warmer, so Zhao Xiaoxuan put on a super low-cut black bustier, and her boobs were half exposed.

When Zhao Xiaoxuan arrived at the private room her friend booked, she heard moans of sexual pleasure the second she pushed the door open. There were three people, one woman and two men, on the sofa with their bodies barely covered in clothes.

The woman was sitting on one man’s lap wearing a short, tight skirt, and the man’s hand was moving between her legs. Her shirt was wide open with her breasts bare in the air, and she was moaning from the pleasure.

Seeing the scene, Zhao Xiaoxuan didn’t show any astonishment or panic, because it wasn’t the first time she had seen it. To be specific, she had also done that many times before.

In the old days, once she broke up with her boyfriend, she would go to a clubhouse for money boys. However, she wouldn’t allow the money boys to penetrate her, but just had sex with hands or mouth. She stopped doing that after Lin Tianyou became her boyfriend.

The sound of Zhao Xiaoxuan pushing the door open interrupted them, and they looked at her with one accord.

“Xiaoxuan, come here!” The woman smiled with satisfaction, and didn’t seem sad at all. She had plenty of choices to satisfy her sexual needs, and she didn’t care about a serious relationship at all.

Zhao Xiaoxuan walked over and sat down with a calm face. She poured a glass of beer and downed it at once.

“What? You’re not happy today.” The woman stood up from the man’s legs, and adjusted her clothes before walking to Zhao Xiaoxuan.

She sat down right next to Zhao Xiaoxuan and laid an arm on her shoulder. “Did you argue with Lin Tianyou again?”

Although it was a question, she already had the answer.

“Yeah,” Zhao Xiaoxuan said.

“Do you want to have some fun with them?” the woman asked.

“Enjoy it yourself. You know I stopped doing that after Lin Tianyou became my boyfriend,” Zhao Xiaoxuan said.

They were close friends, and shared many dirty secrets with each other. In other people’s eyes, they were still good well-educated girls. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“No way. You can’t stop having fun just because of him! Do you think he’s loyal to you?” the woman said, as if she had already seen through men. She had slept with different men, some of which had a girlfriend or were even married, but none of them cared about it.

Hearing that, Zhao Xiaoxuan’s hand which was holding the glass stopped for a second. She didn’t know whether Lin Tianyou was cheating on her, but she felt mad once she thought of the fact that Lin Tianyou still liked Yu Zi. She was loyal to him, but he was still in love with another woman.

“Nobody will know what you’ve done if you have some fun here. Come on, don’t wear a sad face all the time!” The woman persuaded Zhao Xiaoxuan to join them, because she thought that it would more fun to have sex with more people.

“Fine!” Zhao Xiaoxuan agreed in annoyance. She was still mad at Lin Tianyou. Since he still loved Yu Zi, she thought that it was unfair to expect her to stay loyal to him.

Zhao Xiaoxuan drank another glass of beer, then undressed herself right in front of them.

After that, Zhao Xiaoxuan walked to the two money boys along with her friend to have a foursome.

Gu Ning, Gu Man and Leng Shaoting left the hospital an hour later. When they got home, Gu Man went to rest in her room and leave space for Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

Gu Man understood that Gu Ning was a mature girl with principles, so she knew that Gu Ning would protect herself well.

The moment Gu Man was back in her room, Leng Shaoting stared at Gu Ning. He wanted to do something, but was afraid that Gu Man might interrupt them.

Gu Ning smiled and said, “Let go for a walk!”

“Why not!” Leng Shaoting agreed at once. As long as they could stay together for a while without other people around, he was satisfied.

Afterwards, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning walked out of the house. Gu Ning, however, went straight to the garage once they were out, which confused Leng Shaoting. “Are we going to drive?”

Gu Ning beamed. “Nope. Come here. I have a gift for you.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting followed her.

It was dark in the garage, but Gu Ning had no intention to turn on the light. All of a sudden, Gu Ning turned around and hugged Leng Shaoting’s neck reaching up to kiss him.

Leng Shaoting was struck dumb for a second, then clasped Gu Ning and kissed her back while his hands moved over her body.

As the kiss became wilder, Leng Shaoting felt dissatisfied and wanted more. However, they were in the garage now. An idea dawned on Leng Shaoting and he asked, “Why don’t we do it in the car?”

Gu Ning was surprised, and also felt excited, but she was slightly worried. “Um, the space is so small in the car, and I’m afraid that we’ll make too much noise.”

Gu Ning was worried that Gu Man would find out what they were doing.

“I’ll be gentle,” Leng Shaoting said.

Gu Ning, however, doubted it, because Leng Shaoting was always full of energy and was sometimes rough.
