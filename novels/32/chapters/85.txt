Chapter 86: What Are You?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After a long breath in, Lin Lijuan lied without hesitation, “Gu Qing, we’re relatives. How could I step aside when you need help? The point is that you never talk to us about your troubles! And Gu Man, the old house belongs to the sons of our mother, but we’ve allowed you to live in there for so many years. We’ve done a lot for you both!”

“They paid you rent! Besides, it was you who kicked them out when they were in trouble!” Gu Qing retorted.

Lin Lijuan was immediately mad. “That was because Gu Ning hit my daughter and even refused to apologize! They deserved it!”

“She deserved it.” Gu Ning met Lin Lijuan’s glare without cowardice.

“You...” Lin Lijuan was annoyed as well as surprised that Gu Ning dared to talk to her in that way. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The people in the Gu Family, especially the younger generation all respected her the most, but Gu Ning was different. She even humiliated Gu Xiaoxiao in front of Lin Lijuan’s face. “What do you think you are to hit my daughter?” Lin Lijuan said.

“What does she think she is to insult me?” Gu Ning asked back.

“So what? What do you think you are? You bastard!” Lin Lijuan swore at Gu Ning in public. She behaved like a crazy woman.

“Shut up!” Both Gu Qing and Gu Man snapped. They were totally aggravated.

“Lin Lijuan, Ningning is my daughter. I won’t allow you to humiliate her!” Gu Man slammed.

Gu Man was gentle, or weak to some extent in her daily life, but once Gu Ning was involved, she would become a hedgehog and attack the enemy at once.

“She doesn’t have a father. She is a bastard!” Lin Lijuan instead didn’t feel guilty at all.

At that time, Lin Lijuan only felt that it suddenly went black. When she got her mind back, Gu Ning’s face was already magnified in front of her eyes.

There was pure coldness in Gu Ning’s eyes. Lin Lijuan immediately felt great pressure. She couldn’t breathe or move at all.

Then, Gu Ning said coldly, “Don’t think that just because you’re older than me, I wouldn’t dare to hit you. If I even hear the word bastard from your mouth once more, you’ll pay for it.”

Gu Ning’s words were like magic sounds, which sank deeply into Lin Lijuan’s mind. She didn’t question her words at all, but felt very frightened.

“Mom, aunt, let’s go.” Gu Ning ignored Lin Lijuan. She left with Gu Man and Gu Qing.

She didn’t want to argue with Lin Lijuan in public, especially when Gu Man and Gu Qing were here too.

Lin Lijuan might not want to maintain her dignity, but Gu Man and Gu Qing cherished theirs.

When Gu Ning and her families were gone, Lin Lijuan finally got her mind back because of a sound from the woman next to her. Although Lin Lijuan still felt afraid of Gu Ning, she was more mad at Gu Ning who had treated her in that way.

Why? How could Gu Ning do that?

Lin Lijuan then realized that everyone around gave her a strange glance because she had behaved like a crazy woman. She regretted it immediately and then rushed out.

Although Lin Lijuan was always pushy and mean to her family, she valued her appearance in others’ eyes very much. However, today she hadn’t restrained herself.

Gu Qing and Gu Man were both annoyed, but they already knew what kind of person Lin Lijuan was, so they kind of got used to it.

“Alright, don’t be mad at someone who isn’t important at all. Let’s keep on shopping,” Gu Ning comforted.

Gu Qing and Gu Man sighed heavily. Actually, they had worried most that Gu Ning would be hurt. However, because Gu Ning remained calm, and they also relaxed a little.

After a while, they all cheered up. Each one of them had many bags in hand.

They bought a lot, not only for themselves, but also for Jiang Xu and Jiang Xinyue. The price ranged from hundreds to thousands of yuan.

Each had bought four to five suits of clothes.

Women loved shopping. Although Gu Man and Gu Qing were not willing to spend a lot of money at first, they soon forgot about it while shopping in the mall.

After that, they went to buy sheet sets.

Gu Ning and her mother bought four sets. Each room needed three sets for replacement. There were three bedrooms in their new house. They naturally needed nine sets in all. However, there were already three sheet sets on the beds in their new house. They were all new too and only needed to be washed.

They had also bought two sheet sets yesterday, and only needed to buy another four sheet sets.

Even though the guest room was empty almost all the time, they wanted to make it look cosy as well.

Gu Qing’s family bought six sheet sets for their three rooms as well.

Those sheet sets were too heavy to carry. Gu Ning also couldn’t put them into the telepathic eye space, because it would expose herself.

Therefore, they could only get the shop owner to help them with delivery. Not now, but when they were about to leave.

There were all kinds of food on the underground floor of the Commercial Building. Cosmetics were on the first floor, and jewelry on the second floor, women’s clothing was on the third floor, men’s clothing on the fourth floor, furniture and domestic appliances on the fifth floor and children’s clothes and stationery on were the sixth floor, while musical instruments and sports equipment were on the seventh floor.

Gu Ning went down to the second floor to buy jewelry for Gu Man and Gu Qing.

Although gold was a little boring, it was suitable for women at Gu Man and Gu Qing’s age.

Jade would be more suitable of course, but their jade hadn’t been done yet. Gu Ning had to wait for Qin Yifan to come back and take the jade to make jewelry. Thus she decided to buy gold for now.

They bought one set each.

A necklace, a pair of earrings, a bracelet and a ring.

Gold wasn’t expensive. One set just cost around forty to fifty thousand yuan.

They then went to get a VIP card in a high-end beauty salon near the Commercial Building. However, their time was limited today, so they didn’t use it right away.

After they got the card, it was almost 5 pm. They also needed to go back home, because Jiang Xinyue was about to leave her school to go home too.

They directly took the delivery car with their sheet sets home.

The delivery car stopped at the outside of G zone, so Gu Ning and her family had to carry all the stuff back by themselves.

Luckily, Jiang Xinyue was back, and she could help.

At the end, Jiang Xinyue carried two sheet sets, Gu Qing and Gu Man each carried four sheet sets, while Gu Ning carried the rest of the bags.

When they were finally home, it was 6 pm already. It was time for their meal.

Gu Qing called Jiang Xu to ask him when he would get back. Jiang Xu was already on his way home, so Gu Qing asked him to go buy some food ingredients on his way.

Although it was a tiring day, they all had great fun.

Jiang Xinyue jumped around with her new clothes in hand. She had never had so many beautiful clothes before!
