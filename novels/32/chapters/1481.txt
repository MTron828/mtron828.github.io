Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

At this moment, Tang Bingsen had no mood to say good-bye to his guests, so he told his people to do that for him.

As a member of the Tang family, Tang Qingyang couldn’t leave right away. He was supposed to stay and comfort his relatives.

“Let’s celebrate in my place tonight.” Song Nan said before he left Tang Qingyang.

Although it was nothing compared with Tang Qingyang’s plan, they still felt happy when Tang Bingsen was humiliated in public.

“Sure.” Tang Qingyang agreed.

Tang Bingjiang’s family also stayed.

Tang Bingjiang didn’t walk to Tang Bingsen until all the other guests were gone. “Bingsen, it’s fine, we can find them.”

Tang Bingjiang didn’t know much about Gu Ning, so he believed that it was very easy for the Tang family to catch her and Qi Ziyue. However, it was super hard in Tang Bingsen’s eyes. Gu Ning wasn’t a common woman, she was a strong enemy.

Tang Bingjiang knew nothing about its complexity, but Tang Bingsen didn’t bother to explain it right now.

Although Tang Bingsen was angry and impatient, he didn’t vent his anger on Tang Bingjiang and told his family to go home earlier.

Tang Bingjiang listened to him and left with his family. Tang Qingyang also walked out.

...

When Qi Ziyue ran to the parking lot, he quickly got into his car and drove it away.

Those bodyguards who were chasing him also got in a car.

Gu Ning took a taxi instead, because nobody paid much attention to her on her way out.

It was just the beginning of her revenge, and she was in a very good mood now. She sent K a message and told him to focus on the direction in which Qi Ziyue escaped. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She didn’t chase Qi Ziyue right now, but decided to meet him after K found where he stopped and stayed after escaping. At the same time, she needed to know the ward and the hospital that Tang Yaxin was admitted to.

Gu Ning told K to upload the sex photos onto the Internet. Whether the reporters would do it or not, she wouldn’t hesitate to spread it abroad.

K was a top hacker, so it was impossible for Tang Bingsen to find him.

Since they were determined to make it a piece of big news, K wouldn’t simply upload those nude pictures to the Internet. He needed to make it one of the hottest topics in social media. Internet users were quite interested in scandals, so it would undoubtedly go viral within a short time.

Those photos of Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin having sex with other men and women were attached to the news, but some parts of their bodies were pixelated. The content of the news mainly introduced the story that happened at Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin’s wedding today.

Because of the Tang family’s influence, many entertainment influencers on Weibo reposted the news at once.

Within minutes, it became the top of the hottest topics on Weibo, and more and more Internet users were attracted to this shocking scandal.

“Oh my eyes!”

“It’s disgusting.”

“I’m eating, and now I’ve lost my appetite.”

“Since they’re playing around with other men and women behind each other’s back, they aren’t in love at all.”

“Why do they still want to get married?”

“For wealth and more benefits of course.”

“I don’t understand the rich people’s world.”

“...”

After reading the content, Internet users began to talk about Qi Ziyue’s aim.

“Qi Ziyue married Tang Yaxin simply to steal the Tang family’s property and take his revenge!”

“It’s shameless!”

“He’s an evil man, and he has no loyalty towards his partner, but why is Tang Yaxin willing to marry him?”

“I think she’s cheating on him as well.”

“Neither of them is loyal.”

“Betrayal is so common nowadays.”

“...”

Some Internet Users also noticed the appearance of “Tang Aining” at the wedding.

“Wow, Tang Bingsen has another daughter!”

“Is she his older daughter? Why is he hiding his older daughter from the public?”

“Everyone only knows that Tang Yaxin is the heir of the Tang family, but now it seems different.”
