Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Saying that, Zhan Zhiyin’s mother got even angrier. All of a sudden, she blurted it out. “He abandoned his pregnant ex-girlfriend and slept with his ex-girlfriend’s good friend. He’s clearly a jerk.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What? Really?” Zhan Daosong was astonished and looked mad too.

He had had a good impression of Xu Zhihao, but he wouldn’t force Zhan Zhiyin to be together with him because Zhan Zhiyin didn’t like him.

Unexpectedly, Xu Zhihao turned out to be such a terrible man.

Mrs. Zhan was surprised and embarrassed when Zhan Zhiyin’s mother said it aloud.

As Xu Zhihao’s aunt, she was aware of that, but she didn’t think it was a big deal. Anyway, it was in the past.

Thinking of that, she said, “No young man hasn’t made mistakes. It’s over and he’s different now!”

“It’s not just a mistake, it’s a person’s quality. If I introduce such a terrible man to your daughter, would you accept?” asked Zhan Zhiyin’s mother.

“Of course n…” Mrs. Zhan subconsciously responded, but before she finished, she realized she shouldn’t say that. She immediately changed her attitude and said, “Don’t criticize me like that. I just want Zhiyin to be happy.”

Although she said that, she wouldn’t let her own daughter date such a terrible bad man. Her daughter was going to marry a governor’s son and they had a good relationship now.

In fact, she set up Zhan Zhiyin and Xu Zhihao in order to help the Xu family. If Zhan Zhiyin married into the Xu family, it would be very good for the Xu family.

Moreover, because Zhan Zhiyin was better than her own daughter, she didn’t want Zhan Zhiyin to marry a better man than her own daughter.

“Oh, really? I don’t think so. You simply want your nephew to live a good life. If you really care about Zhiyin, shut up now. Zhiyin already has a quality man. If she becomes your nephew’s girlfriend, she wouldn’t be as happy. You don’t want your own daughter to have such a terrible man as her boyfriend, why do you want to introduce my daughter to him? If you have nothing to do, pay more attention to your own daughter and stay away from mine!” said Zhan Zhiyin’s mother angrily. She was furious.

Mrs. Zhan was very selfish and the other members of the Zhan family didn’t like her very much, but she wouldn’t cause serious trouble, so they wouldn’t argue with her.

However, what she said today was unacceptable.

“You…” Mrs. Zhan was furious. “You don’t cherish my kindness at all! You…”

“Enough!” Before she could finish, Zhan Daosong stopped her and gave her a glare. “Stop talking about that now. You should at least have an understanding of yourself. Don’t be so self-centered and force other people to do what you wouldn’t like. You don’t have that power.”

He originally thought that Mrs. Zhan was kind, but now she turned out to be very malicious.

When Zhan Daosong opened his mouth, Mrs. Zhan didn’t dare to say another word, but she was still mad.

The Leng family was indeed influential and Leng Shaoming was very outstanding, but Zhan Zhiyin was just dating Leng Shaoming. It was hard to know whether they would get married in the future.

Mrs. Zhan really wanted to see Leng Shaoming abandon Zhan Zhiyin.

…

Leng Shaoming also shared the good news with his mother. He actually didn’t want to talk about it since it was his own business, but Zhan Zhiyin quickly shared the news with Master Zhan, so he didn’t want to disappoint her.

Jiang Shuyuan was happy to know that Leng Shaoming and Zhan Zhiyin were finally boyfriend and girlfriend. Without delay, she shared the news with other people in the Leng family.

However, before Leng Shaoming solved the problem he encountered. Something awful happened to Leng Shaojia.

She went abroad the other day. Because she had stayed in Country Y for a few years, she had some friends there. When she got bored, she went to have fun with them.

Unfortunately, the son of a senior official of Country Y sexually harassed her today. They pushed and pulled each other causing her to accidentally push the man down and a sharp stone hit him in the back of his head. Then he lost consciousness.

As a result, Leng Shaojia was kept in Country Y and the government wanted Leng Yuanqian to come and deal with it in person.

Knowing that, the Leng family immediately thought it might be a scheme, and there must be a storm.

Anyway, since they wanted Leng Yuanqian to go there, Leng Yuanqian had to go. If he didn’t, he couldn’t solve the problem. After all, it was Leng Shaojia’s fault.

However, if Leng Yuanqian went there alone, he would be in a very dangerous situation. Therefore, Master Leng went to talk to Jing Yunyao and wanted her to go with to protect Leng Yuanqian.

Anyway, Jing Yunyao was a cultivator with superpowers. With her help, Leng Yuanqian should be fine.

Jing Yunyao disliked Leng Shaojia, but Leng Shaojia was not the only one being targeted this time. The target was Leng Yuanqian and the whole Leng family.

If it was just an accident, Leng Yuanqian didn’t need to go there in person. They would just send over a representative.

Accordingly, Jing Yunyao had to stand out at this moment.

However, if she went there with Leng Yuanqian, it would be inconvenient for them to make the trip together. Jing Yunyao then told Gu Ning about it and asked her to go with her.

However, Gu Ning didn’t think Jing Yunyao should go after hearing about it, because the Leng family could also be in danger if the Leng family was really the target. Jing Yunyao needed to stay to protect the Leng family.

Gu Ning and Si Jin, on the other hand, could go there and protect Leng Yuanqian.

Jing Yunyao agreed and accepted Gu Ning’s plan.

After that, she shared the result with Master Leng, who agreed, but he still called Gu Ning and reminded her to be careful.

It was an emergency so after they made the decision, they booked plane tickets to the capital of Country Y the next day.

Wei Lingfeng knew about it, so he let Leng Yuanqian off for a few days.

Because the Leng family and Wei Lingfeng were on the same boat, they shared glory and failure. If the Leng family was targeted, he could be the main target.

Even if the target wasn’t him, he would also be in danger if the Leng family was in trouble.

After all, it was time to select the new president, and the selection was only a month away. Currently he was the most popular candidate.

Under his leadership, their country made obvious progress, so he had a wide range of support.
