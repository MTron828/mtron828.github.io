Chapter 1743: An Immortal Fox?

Although this girl in front of it was indeed different from other mortals, it didn’t think that she had the ability to help it.

“I’m not sure whether I can help you or not, because I don’t know what you’ve been through yet. If you don’t tell me, how can I know whether I can help you?” said Gu Ning. She really wanted to roll her eyes at it, but she controlled herself.

Hearing that, the male ghost agreed. It hesitated for a second, then told Gu Ning the story.

“The reason why I still have obsessions is that when I died, the token of love my wife gave me was taken away by another person. Because I was unwilling to accept it, I became a ghost. Afterwards, I’ve been following the person who took my token. However, as a ghost, I can’t touch mortals at all. Therefore, even if I could see the token in the hands of another man, I couldn’t take it back. That person’s grave is under the haunted house, so I stayed there and didn’t want to leave.”

Although it wasn’t sure whether Gu Ning could help it, it hoped that she could because it didn’t want to miss this great chance.

“So your current obsession is to get that token,” Gu Ning said. It wasn’t a question, because she was very sure about the answer.

Because it was a ghost, it couldn’t touch the token. However, the only thing it wanted to do now was to touch the token.

“Right,” said the male ghost.

“I’m afraid I can’t help you with it for the time being, but I have a very skilled master. He might be helpful,” said Gu Ning.

She told the truth. She indeed couldn’t help the male ghost with that, so she could only turn to Shangguan Yang for help.

Knowing that, the male ghost was disappointed. It knew that Gu Ning might not have the ability to help it.

Anyway, since she said that she had a very skilled master and her master might be helpful, it had hope again. Even though it wasn’t very likely to happen, it badly wanted to get the token back. As a result, the male ghost agreed. “Great.”

“Well, I need to keep you in my space right now, and I’ll let you out after I have the answer from my master. If you dare to fight back, I won’t waste time helping you and I’ll directly ruin you,” said Gu Ning. She was obviously threatening it.

The male ghost hesitated for a second, then said, “Sure.”

Even though it doubted whether Gu Ning would really let it out again after keeping it in her space, it still agreed.

After that, Gu Ning walked to the male ghost. She reached her hand to it, and the male ghost was instinctively scared by her, but it didn’t resist at all. It was curious about how Gu Ning put it into her space, but it knew that Gu Ning wouldn’t tell it, so it didn’t bother to ask her.

The second Gu Ning touched the male ghost, it felt like its soul was pulled out and it lost consciousness the next second.

After that, Gu Ning let out the male ghost she ran into at the construction site. She planned to meet Shangguan Yang tomorrow.

Although this male ghost had been covered in magical power in Gu Ning’s telepathic eye space, it only stayed there for a few days. Besides, it was filled with strong hatred, so it still looked evil at this time.

What was worse, this male ghost was locked into the space by Gu Ning, so it hated Gu Ning very much. Once it was released, it glared at Gu Ning as if it wanted to kill her.

It indeed wanted to kill Gu Ning, but it also understood that it was no match for her. Therefore, it tried to escape the second it was released. It could only run away and come back to take revenge after making progress in cultivation.

The male ghost moved fast and it flew far away from Gu Ning in the blink of an eye. It was impossible for Gu Ning to catch it, so she let the flood dragon out at once.

“Ruin it right now.” Gu Ning gave an order, and the flood dragon rushed to the male ghost without delay.

The male ghost moved faster than Gu Ning, but it wasn’t comparable to the flood dragon, and the flood dragon soon caught it.

The male ghost was terrified. However, before it could make any other moves, it felt that its soul was pulled away and the flood dragon swallowed it the next second.

The flood dragon absorbed a lot of evil power along with much magical power, so its level increased a lot compared with when it first met Gu Ning. Nevertheless, it was still far from the heavenly tribulation. It didn’t do cultivation every day after all, because it stayed in Gu Ning’s telepathic eye space most of the time.

When the flood dragon went back to Gu Ning, Gu Ning put it away into her telepathic eye space, then let the monster fox out.

Once the monster fox was released, it had the same reaction as the male ghost and was amazed by the big change of the environment. In their eyes, it changed all of a sudden, because their consciousness stopped the second they were put into Gu Ning’s telepathic eye space, and their memories also paused the second before that.

“Why am I here?” The monster fox came out with its back facing Gu Ning, so it didn’t see her right away. It was greatly surprised by the hot weather because it remembered that it was in a winter mountain before.

As it said that, it smelt a human. It turned around at once and its sight fell on Gu Ning. Gu Ning looked familiar, but she was in different clothes, which surprised the monster fox again. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

However, once it remembered that it was Gu Ning who had injured it, the monster fox became furious. It didn’t have time to figure out why it suddenly came here and why Gu Ning changed her clothes, and began to attack Gu Ning.

Gu Ning didn’t rush to stop it, but she directly put it into the telepathic eye space once it touched her. After that, she let it out again, but caught its tail.

Whatever was put into Gu Ning’s telepathic eye space, she could control its position. Therefore, when the monster fox regained its consciousness, it found that its tail was caught by Gu Ning. It was shocked and confused at the same time, but became angrier. It struggled, trying to get rid of Gu Ning, but failed.

“Damn you, stupid human!” The monster fox growled and snapped at Gu Ning, “Let me go! I’m an immortal fox.”

“Why should I let you go since you want to hurt me?” Gu Ning calmly asked.

Hearing that, the monster fox was astonished and couldn’t believe its ears. “How is it possible that you can understand my language?”

Although it said something, it didn’t expect Gu Ning to understand it, because they were different species. Unexpectedly, Gu Ning could understand it.

“Why wouldn’t I understand your language?” Gu Ning made fun of it.
