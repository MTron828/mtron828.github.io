Chapter 2580: Trustworthy

When they met, Gu Ning saw that Kang Shaojie was obviously in a bad mood. She also knew the reason, but she had no intention of asking about it first. If she asked about it, he would know that she had investigated them beforehand.

Therefore, Gu Ning had to wait till Kang Shaojie brought it up.

After they met, they went to order. When they had finished ordering, they began to talk about the matter.

“Miss Gu, do you agree to work with me?” Kang Shaojie asked. He wanted to know Gu Ning’s answer first.

“Yes.” Gu Ning replied.

“Thank you so much, Miss Gu, but there is one thing I need to tell you. After I cut out the jade yesterday, my uncle learned about it. He changed his mind and now won’t allow me to have a helper. I disagreed, because he can’t just do whatever he wants. Unfortunately, my uncle has deep support in the company. Many shareholders support him, so I’m afraid I can’t defeat him…” said Kang Shaojie resignedly.

Because Gu Ning was already aware of that, she wasn’t surprised.

After a pause, Kang Shaojie continued. “So, if the situation really changes at that time, I’m afraid I’ll have wasted your time. But don’t worry, even if we can’t cooperate this time, I’ll still do you the favor. After all, I sincerely hope that we can be friends. And I also need to thank you for helping me cut out the jade yesterday.”

Hearing that, Gu Ning had a better impression of him, because Kang Shaojie clearly understood gratitude.

“Where will you have the competition?” Gu Ning asked.

“Right in the store There will be a new batch of raw jade materials arriving tomorrow morning,” said Kang Shaojie.

“Can people go in and watch?” Gu Ning asked.

“It’s public in case anyone refuses to accept the result. People can go in and watch,” said Kang Shaojie.

“Well, if so, when you’re competing, can you answer a call or read a message?” asked Gu Ning. If it was allowed, there wouldn’t be a problem.

“I can,” said Kang Shaojie. When he heard that question, he realized that Gu Ning might plan to guide him through the phone, but guests were forbidden to examine the raw jade materials, so Kang Shaojie didn’t think it would work. “Um, the guests are forbidden to examine the raw jade materials.”

“It’s OK. Just keep your phone on. I’ll think of a way then. I only need you to trust me,” said Gu Ning.

Upon hearing that, Kang Shaojie cheered up. Although he didn’t know what idea Gu Ning had, he trusted her, so he said, “Of course, you have my trust!”

At the moment he could only trust Gu Ning.

Even though he barely knew Gu Ning, he had a feeling that she was trustworthy. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“However, there aren’t any numbers on the raw jade materials this time,” said Kang Shaojie worriedly.

“It’s not a big problem. I can take a picture of them, then leave some marks before sending it back to you. But you better delete it right after you see it. I don’t want anyone else to find out,” said Gu Ning.

“Great, Miss Gu, thank you so much for your help!” Kang Shaojie thanked Gu Ning. At this moment, he was finally relieved. Although he wasn’t sure he could win, the situation had become much better. At least, he had a 70% probability to win.

The competition hadn’t begun and there was no outcome yet, but Kang Shaojie would do Gu Ning the favor that he had promised, whether she was able to help him or not.

Therefore, after having a meal, Kang Shaojie took Gu Ning to the Bureau of Land and Resources.

They needed to see which mountains were still available, so that they could go to have a look.

Although this city was the place of production of raw jade materials, it wasn’t easy to acquire a mountain. In fact, a mountain was very expensive and not many could afford it. Besides, the government asked for a full payment.

There were many mountains, but not all of them contained raw jade materials. Only 1% of them had raw jade materials. Therefore, it would be a waste of money if one bought a mountain that didn’t contain any raw jade materials.

In addition, the mountains here were of no other use.

Therefore, developers had to conduct a long-term inspection to make sure that a mountain was a good choice.

In the end, most of the time, it was a gamble when they bought a mountain, because it was hard to know whether there was raw jade materials.

If it was easy to know which mountain contained raw jade materials, the government wouldn’t rely on selling mountains to make money.

Public servants and officials weren’t allowed to do business in private, and they couldn’t afford it either.

Therefore, even if the government found raw jade materials in a mountain, they could only ask for a higher price.

Developers weren’t allowed to dig a hole to see whether there was raw jade materials in the mountain, but they could make an observation from the surface, which relied on their luck.

Moreover, even if there were raw jade materials in a mountain, they couldn’t know how much there was. Some mountains only contained a small number of raw jade materials, so it wasn’t worth buying.

All in all, there were risks to buying a mountain, so not many businessmen could make a good choice.

Gu Ning, however, could easily solve the problem with her Jade Eyes.

The deputy director of the Bureau of Land and Resources had a good relationship with Kang Shaojie, so he treated Gu Ning politely when they met.

According to what was said, it wasn’t easy to buy a mountain. One had to show his or her bank deposit, transactions, and prove that they had the ability to pay the full amount as well as to see whether the money was from a legal source.

It was necessary, because the government couldn’t allow criminals to use the mountains for money laundering.

Gu Ning was well-prepared for that.

When the deputy director mentioned the requirements, Gu Ning immediately took out a folder with her credit record inside without any loan history.

There were also the business license of Jade Beauty Jewelry, the tax registration certificate of the national tax and local tax, the organization code certificate, the bank account opening certificate and the transactions of her bank cards, etc.

After reading those documents, Kang Shaojie and the deputy director were both surprised. Unexpectedly, Gu Ning was the legal owner of an enterprise.

And her company was the famous Jade Beauty Jewelry.
