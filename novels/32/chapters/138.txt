Chapter 139: A Strict Boss

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Leng Shaoting gave Xu Jinchen a cold look. Xu Jinchen shut his mouth at once, but he stared at Leng Shaoting back. He wasn’t wrong after all.

Actually, Leng Shaoting was asking himself the same question too. Since when had he become so friendly to others?

However, hadn’t he always been kind?

His job, and the tasks he had fulfilled were all aimed at punishing evil people as well as bringing peace to this country.

“Is he always cold?” Gu Ning asked Xu Jinchen, but looked to Leng Shaoting.

“Not really. He is active in work, but I’ve never seen him being proactive to help others with personal affairs.” Xu Jinchen was telling the truth. Leng Shaoting was indeed active in fulfilling his tasks, or dealing with crime, but if someone turned to him for help concerning personal affairs, he would give them the cold shoulder.

“Oh, in that case, it seems I’m different.” Gu Ning beamed. She gave Leng Shaoting a meaningful look. He felt nervous, but he had to admit that Gu Ning was different to him.

Meanwhile, Gu Ning couldn’t help feeling happy in her heart. She wasn’t clear why she was so happy to hear that, but she just enjoyed it.

“Exactly! Otherwise I wouldn’t think that you two are...” Xu Jinchen said.

“Enough! If you keep talking without an end, I’ll let you be busier as of this year,” Leng Shaoting interrupted Xu Jinchen before he could finish. It was an obvious threat.

Hearing that, Xu Jinchen shut his mouth again. He wanted to complain, but didn’t dare to say a word. Leng Shaoting was the boss. It was totally up to him whether Xu Jinchen would be busy.

From Xu Jinchen’s experience, he knew the harder he resisted, the worse the situation would be.

Xu Jinchen couldn’t argue with Leng Shaoting. He could only approach Gu Ning, complaining in a low voice, “Be careful. He’s so easily annoyed, and is used to exploiting us.”

Although Xu Jinchen kept his voice low, Leng Shaoting still heard him clearly.

He was displeased that Xu Jinchen complained about him to Gu Ning. And the two stood so close now. Leng Shaoting was dissatisfied. He threatened, “If you want to, I can make your allegation the truth.”

It was a threat from Xu Jinchen’s perspective, but Gu Ning thought it was an explanation.

Xu Jinchen now completely shut his mouth in fear. His boss was a doer, not a talker. He didn’t want to challenge Leng Shaoting at all.

Xu Jinchen worked for Leng Shaoting. Gu Ning was slightly surprised. In that case, Xu Jinchen was a military officer too.

Seeing as Leng Shaoting denied Xu Jinchen’s complaint then who was telling the truth?

Gu Ning thought that Xu Jinchen was probably right, because Leng Shaoting did force him to close his mouth by threatening him, but Gu Ning stayed quiet.

Before long, they arrived at the restaurant, walking into a private room.

“Here, help yourself please.” Xu Jinchen gave the menu to Gu Ning.

Gu Ning took it without hesitation. She ordered two dishes that she liked then gave the menu back to Xu Jinchen and Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning and Xu Jinchen exchanged their numbers too.

Xu Jinchen had said that he was able to deal with many problems. Thus Gu Ning assumed that he had a powerful background. Gu Ning wasn’t dumb enough to reject such a good opportunity.

Meanwhile, Gu Ning thought to herself that she was so lucky in this incarnation to meet so many kind people. She of course had also met many bad people along the way.

Leng Shaoting wasn’t willing to see the two being so close, but he didn’t stop them. He wasn’t in an appropriate position to stop them, and there was no need to do so.

They all lived in Fenghua Luxury Mansion, so they walked back together after the meal.

Xu Jinchen and Leng Shaoting walked Gu Ning to zone G before they went back home.

Gu Ning sent Leng Shaoting a message when she was home. Leng Shaoting stayed awake all night because of it.

Gu Ning: “My handsome military officer, please take care of yourself while you’re fulfilling your tasks. You’re the best! XOXO.”

Actually, Gu Ning was just having fun. She found that Leng Shaoting was very shy and introverted, though he was always cold. Therefore, she felt like flirting with him.

Leng Shaoting knew that Gu Ning did it on purpose, but he couldn’t stop himself from thinking of her.

It was around 8 pm at that time.

In a bedroom, there were endless moans of sexual pleasure and man and a woman were having fierce sex on a big white bed.

The man was Gu Qinxiang, while the woman was Liu Yuwei.

Liu Yuwei was much prettier without the glasses, especially her eyes. She could easily distract a man with her alluring eyes.

In fact, she wore a pair of big glass to disguise herself. She didn’t want to attract too much attention, especially the suspicion from Lin Lijuan, because of her charming appearance.

After half an hour of wild love-making, the two finally stopped.

Liu Yuwei cleaned herself up and lay on Gu Qinxiang’s chest. “Boss, do you feel better now?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Liu Yuwei knew that Gu Qinxiang was in a bad mood, but she didn’t know the reason. She wouldn’t ask, because she understood when she should stay quiet. That was her way to keep Gu Qinxiang being interested in her.

“Yeah, much better. Baby, you’re the only one who can make me happy!” Gu Qinxiang kissed Liu Yuwei deeply.

Liu Yuwei was skillful in bed. Gu Qinxiang was aware Liu Yuwei had had many lovers, but he didn’t care. As long as Liu Yuwei didn’t carry diseases and was able to make him sexually happy, he was satisfied. It was just a game after all.

After the sexual excitement, Gu Qinxiang felt tired. It wasn’t early, and he should go back home now, in case someone found them.

Gu Qinxiang had a short break before taking a bath. He cleaned himself up, and even drank as well as sprayed some wine around his body. He made it seem like he had just left from a social meeting. Those were Gu Qinxiang’s usual methods to deceive Lin Lijuan.

Gu Qinxiang went back home. The minute he walked into his room, he saw Lin Lijuan lying on the bed in a red transparent sleeping gown. She made eyes at Gu Qinxiang saying, “My love, how is my dress?”

Lin Lijuan remained in good shape. Her skin was also in good condition, but her breasts were clearly drooping. She was hardly comparable with the young and sexy Liu Yuwei.

Accordingly, Gu Qinxiang felt nothing when he saw Lin Lijuan. Besides, he just got out of another bed. He was weak now, so he only answered perfunctorily then ignored her.
