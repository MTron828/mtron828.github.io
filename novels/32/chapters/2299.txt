Chapter 2301: I Didn’t Steal Him

“Nonsense!” Xie Yilun was shocked by Gu Ning’s words and snapped at her loudly in humiliation.

His shout attracted a lot of attention from passers-by, so Xie Yilun felt very embarrassed. Luckily, they weren’t on a main road, or there would be more onlookers, which would be more embarrassing.

Gu Ning didn’t feel embarrassed, because she was much more mature.

When they talked with each other, Song Miaoge and Zhang Zikai couldn’t hear them, but they heard Xie Yilun’s angry shout.

Baili Zongxue, on the other hand, could hear their conversation from the beginning to the end, so she felt amused when Gu Ning deliberately embarrassed Xie Yilun.

She understood that Gu Ning was just joking, and she didn’t think Xie Yilun really liked Leng Shaoting.

“That man obviously came to argue with Gu Ning,” said Baili Zongxue. However, Xie Yilun wouldn’t succeed. Baili Zongxue wasn’t worried about that at all.

Song Miaoge and Zhang Zikai agreed with her. Although they didn’t know what grudge Xie Yilun had against Gu Ning, they hated those who came to argue with Gu Ning. Therefore, Song Miaoge and Zhang Zikai began to look at Xie Yilun unkindly.

“Since it’s not you who admires him from afar, why do you want me to leave him? There must be a reason, right?” Gu Ning asked lazily, arms crossed over her chest.

“Because you don’t deserve him,” said Xie Yilun. He stared at Gu Ning disdainfully.

“Oh? If I don’t deserve him, who deserves him?” asked Gu Ning.

“My older sister,” said Xie Yilun.

“Who’s your older sister?” Gu Ning was displeased. Did another woman fall in love with Leng Shaoting?

“You don’t need to know that. My older sister grew up with Shaoting. She has tried very hard to win his heart. You can’t steal him away from my older sister!” Xie Yilun angrily criticized.

“Pffttt.” Gu Ning snorted with laughter. There were always dramatic love stories! She just learned about Miao Jingjing’s dramatic love story a few days ago, and now it happened to her.

“Are you a college student?” asked Gu Ning. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xie Yilun was struck dumb by Gu Ning’s sudden question, but he still replied. “Yeah.”

“Since you’re a college student, why are you still so childish?” Gu Ning laughed at him.

“What? How dare you say that!” Xie Yilun lost his temper.

More passers-by turned to look at him this time.

“Pffttt.” Baili Zongxue and the other girls snorted with laughter again.

Several onlookers also tutted, which angered Xie Yilun. He then blamed Gu Ning for it. If it hadn’t been for her, he wouldn’t have been embarrassed in public twice! Therefore, Xie Yilun glared at Gu Ning. Right when he was about to criticize Gu Ning, Gu Ning opened her mouth first.

“If you’re not childish, you should know you can’t force a man to love a certain woman. If Leng Shaoting liked your older sister, he would have chosen her. You said your older sister has tried very hard to win his heart. That’s what your older sister has done, but it doesn’t mean that Leng Shaoting has to accept her. Leng Shaoting can choose on his own. Do you want to force him to make the choice? Do you think you can do that?

“You can put yourself in his shoes. If you don’t like a girl who admires you, but the girl blames you for not accepting her and even goes to hurt the one you love, what will you think? You said I stole Leng Shaoting, but it was Leng Shaoting who pursued me. I didn’t steal him away.

“And, it’s not up to you whether I deserve Leng Shaoting or not. Love is unconditional. Only snobbish people care more about one’s family background than affection. The Leng family already accepted me. Who do you think you are? If you are unsatisfied, go to argue with the Leng family or Leng Shaoting about it. Stop blaming me for it.” Gu Ning defended herself.

Xie Yilun didn’t know what to say all of a sudden. He had to admit that Gu Ning was right and he actually agreed with her.

Xie Yiyi admired Leng Shaoting and tried very hard to win his heart, but it didn’t mean Leng Shaoting had to accept her.

Xie Yilun personally wouldn’t accept a girl he disliked. And if the girl dared to hurt the one he loved because of that, he would be mad too. It was also true that love was unconditional and money wasn’t everything. Moreover, the Leng family already accepted Gu Ning, and his opinion wasn’t important at all.

He definitely didn’t dare to argue with Leng Shaoting or the Leng family.

Seeing that Xie Yilun remained silent, Gu Ning understood that he was convinced. In that case, he wasn’t a selfish man. He just couldn’t accept the fact and needed help to understand it.

And because Xie Yilun figured it out, he finally realized that it was impulsive to have come to argue with Gu Ning. He was worried that Gu Ning might tell Leng Shaoting and the Leng family about what he had done today, and his family might be affected.

“What else do you want to say? If there is anything, I’m willing to talk. If not, I need to leave now. My friends are waiting for me,” said Gu Ning.

Xie Yilun didn’t answer right away, and hesitated. Although he didn’t know what he could say at this moment, he was still reluctant to accept the result. After all, he cared about his older sister. His older sister liked Leng Shaoting so much, but Leng Shaoting already had a fiancée. It was hard for him to accept it.

“Anything else?” Gu Ning asked when Xie Yilun hesitated to say anything.

Xie Yilun took a deep breath and said, “Not at all.”

He wanted to say something, but didn’t know what he could say.

Xie Yiyi had known Leng Shaoting for so long. If they could be together, they would have gotten together long ago. Xie Yiyi failed to win Leng Shaoting’s heart because Leng Shaoting didn’t have special feelings for her. It wasn’t Gu Ning’s fault. Therefore, he couldn’t blame Gu Ning for it. In fact, Gu Ning didn’t know who his older sister was at all!

Actually, Gu Ning knew Xie Yiyi, but didn’t know that Xie Yiyi was his older sister.
