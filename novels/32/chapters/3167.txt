Chapter 3168: Can’t Be Easily Persuaded

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

At this moment, Lu Laosan was practicing drawing talismans in the study on the second floor. Unfortunately, no matter how he tried, none of the talismans were useful.

“Are you drawing talismans? Do you need me to teach you?” Leng Xiaoyao said from outside the window.

Lu Laosan was scared by the sudden female voice and immediately turned to look out of the window.

Because of the security window, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t get in. She only stepped on it and supported herself by pressing her hands against it.

Actually, the security window couldn’t stop Leng Xiaoyao from getting inside. She could easily break it.

The moment Lu Laosan saw Leng Xiaoyao, he recognized her. She was the woman who was with Shen Xiyin today.

When he saw her today, he only thought that she was beautiful and didn’t think she was special. However, now she suddenly appeared, which proved she wasn’t ordinary even if Lu Laosan didn’t know who she was.

She directly reached the window without him noticing anything. If she didn’t talk to him, he wouldn’t have known she was here.

In addition, she knew he was drawing talismans and even asked whether he needed her to teach him.

He understood that she wouldn’t really teach him, but it meant that she could draw talismans.

Thinking of that, Lu Laosan wondered whether the disappearance of evil power around the jade pendant had something to do with her.

“Who are you?” Lu Laosan had goosebumps. Looking at Leng Xiaoyao he stayed alert.

Lu Laosan had to be alert since Leng Xiaoyao could reach the window without attracting any attention from him.

“The person who come to cause you trouble.” Leng Xiaoyao put on an evil smile.

The next moment, Leng Xiaoyao pulled the security window off and directly went inside.

Because she used magical power, Lu Laosan sensed it too and rounded his eyes in shock.

It was magical power!

Seeing Leng Xiaoyao climb in, Lu Laosan subconsciously wanted to run away. Unfortunately, in the blink of an eye, Leng Xiaoyao blocked his way with her body. She also gave him a kick causing him to fall to the ground.

“T-There is no grudge between us. Why do you want to cause me trouble?” Lu Laosan asked, covering his stomach.

Obviously he knew the reason. It must have something to do with Shen Xiyin, but he played dumb, trying to get away with it.

“There is indeed no grudge between us, but you have bad luck and I caught you trying to harm my friend,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“It’s none of your business.” Lu Laosan argued.

“So what? Anyway, I won’t let evil people like you run away once I meet you,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Normally, she wouldn’t interfere in other people’s affairs, but the situation was different this time.

“You…” Lu Laosan was mad, but he understood that good cultivators would never allow evil cultivators to exist. Even if he didn’t hurt Leng Xiaoyao’s friend and she didn’t catch him doing anything bad, she would still destroy him.

However, he was reluctant to accept it when a stranger caused him trouble all of a sudden.

Because he was reluctant to accept it, he decided to fight back.

Without delay, Lu Laosan got up and attacked Leng Xiaoyao.

Lu Laosan was good at fighting, but he was only stronger than ordinary people. He was not comparable to Leng Xiaoyao. As a result, Leng Xiaoyao easily beat Lu Laosan down within seconds. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

If Leng Xiaoyao was an ordinary person, Lu Laosan would be extremely astonished. After all, he was beaten by a young woman within a few seconds. However, Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t an ordinary girl, she was a cultivator. Therefore, even though she was young, it was normal for her to be so skilled. After failing to escape through violence, Lu Laosan had to give in. Although it might not be useful, he had to seize every chance to run away.

He immediately knelt down to Leng Xiaoyao and begged. “Please, please forgive me. I promise I won’t harm Shen Xiyin again. If I do that again, you can directly kill me after catching me next time.”

“Do you think I can be so easily persuaded?” Leng Xiaoyao sneered.

Lu Laosan despaired. It seemed that this woman wouldn’t let him go.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She usually didn’t kill. Although Lu Laosan joined the Evil Practice, he wasn’t completely one of them.

He was half an ordinary and half a bad cultivator.

Therefore, if she killed him, it would cause her bad luck.

However, even if she wouldn’t kill him, she would deprive him of his abilities.

She wouldn’t allow him to hurt anyone again.

Upon hearing that Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t kill him, Lu Laosan was excited. However, he was upset the next moment. Even though Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t kill him, she wouldn’t let him go easily either. All in all, he had to pay a price this time and felt miserable.

Observing the change in Lu Laosan’s expressions, Leng Xiaoyao understood what he was thinking. She smiled and said, “I won’t kill you, but you shouldn’t have the abilities to harm other people.”

Saying that, Leng Xiaoyao walked towards Lu Laosan.

“N-N-No…” Lu Laosan was a sure bet right now. He had nowhere to escape, but he still struggled.

Even if he was reluctant to accept it, he couldn’t escape.

Leng Xiaoyao deprived Lu Laosan of his abilities with magical power, then disabled his right hand.

After Lu Laosan lost his abilities, he became very weak too. It was impossible for him to cultivate again, unless a cultivator at a high level cured him. Although Leng Xiaoyao knew it was possible, she wouldn’t kill Lu Laosan just because a cultivator at a high level could cure him.

After all, Lu Laosan didn’t have to pay such a high price for what he had done yet.

Leng Xiaoyao planned to check on Lu Laosan once in a while afterwards.

Lu Laosan was disabled, so he couldn’t harm other people again. However, it didn’t mean that he wouldn’t ask someone else to do it. Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao warned him. “Lu Laosan, I’ll check on you. If you dare to take revenge, you can attack me. My name is Leng Xiaoyao. I’m a student studying in No. 1 High School in City Chang. It’s easy to investigate me, but if you dare to harm Shen Xiyin again, I’ll kill you next time..”
