Chapter 478 Tell Gu Man the Truth

“Hi, Ningning, Xinyue!” Gu Qinyang said with a smile. He was still a little embarrassed to see Gu Ning, but seeing that Gu Ning was being kind he relaxed.

Thinking of the news about the opening ceremony of Jade Beauty Jewelry, Gu Qinyang couldn’t help admiring Gu Ning, because almost half of the important figures in City G had attended it. To his astonishment, Gu Ning was able to know those figures. That being the case, he didn’t dare to annoy her.

Dishes were soon placed on the table. “Dinner’s ready!” Gu Qing said.

“Let’s have dinner!” Jiang Xu said and guided Gu Qinyang to the dining room, followed by Gu Ning and Jiang Xinyue.

When Wen Yulan saw Gu Ning, she felt embarrassed too, but she still greeted them politely. “Hi, Ningning, Xinyue.”

“Hi, aunt,” Gu Ning and Jiang Xinyue replied but they didn’t show much affection.

Seeing that Gu Ning was being nice, Wen Yulan relaxed too. After that, they all sat down around the table.

“Qinyang, let’s have some alcohol together! It’s a new year after all!” Jiang Xu said.

Jiang Xu wasn’t an alcohol lover, and he never drank when he was alone, unless it was the New Year Festival or the Lantern Festival. Since Gu Qinyang was here today, he would love to have some. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Why not!” Gu Qinyang agreed.

Jiang Xu then took out a bottle from his alcohol cabinet. It was Maotai that was made 30 years ago. It was 500 ml with 53% alcohol and cost over four thousand yuan.

Gu Qinyang couldn’t afford such an expensive brand of baijiu[1] but he had heard a lot about

it.

Seeing the Maotai which cost over four thousand yuan a bottle, Gu Qinyang hesitated to drink it, because only a small cup of it might cost several hundred yuan! He couldn’t afford such expensive alcohol throughout his whole life, even Gu Qinxiang who had been the richest one in their family couldn’t afford it either. Gu Qinxiang could only afford alcohol which cost around two thousand yuan.

During this meal, except Gu Qinyang and Wen Yulan who felt uneasy, the rest enjoyed themselves.

After dinner, they were chatting in the living room, and Gu Qinyang took out two red envelopes giving them to Gu Ning and Jiang Xinyue. “These are for you two girls. There isn’t much money inside, but we both wish you Happy New Year!”

A thousand yuan was a lot for Gu Ning in the past but it was nothing in her eyes now.

“Thank you, uncle!” Gu Ning and Jiang Xinyue didn’t show any disdain.

Seeing that, Gu Qinyang relaxed.

Gu Man and Gu Qing also prepared two red envelopes for Gu Qingshi and Gu Yinyin. Wen Yulan took them on behalf of her children. There wasn’t much money in the red envelopes that Gu Qing and Gu Man prepared for Gu Qingshi and Gu Yinyin either, because it was just a form of good wishes.

When it was almost 9 pm, Gu Qinyang and Wen Yulan left. Gu Qing and Gu Man invited them to stay at their home, but Gu Qinyang and Wen Yulan insisted on staying in the hotel. Jiang Xu then drove them to the hotel.

After Gu Qinyang and his wife were gone, Gu Ning went back to her home, but Gu Man didn’t go home until she had chatted with Gu Qing for a while longer.

“Ningning, your uncle’s family has surprisingly changed! We’re relatives after all and let bygones be bygones. If they need help in the future, are you willing to give them a helping hand for my sake?” Gu Man asked Gu Ning the moment she got home.

“Mom, don’t worry. I will,” Gu Ning said. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have proposed to invite them to dine at their home.

“Great!” Gu Man was relieved.

It was late when they both got home, so Gu Ning put off telling Gu Man about Tang Yunfan in case Gu Man couldn’t sleep tonight.

When Gu Ning was in her room, she called Leng Shaoting and told him about Tang Yunfan. She wouldn’t hide it from him. Leng Shaoting also hoped that Gu Ning could have a happy family, and Tang Yunfan could be a good father as well as husband. Most importantly, since Tang Yunfan had fallen in love with Gu Man before, it would be easier for them to get back together.

“Ningning, I’ve been getting busy recently, so I probably won’t have much time to call you. I’ll come to meet you once I’m free,” Leng Shaoting said.

“I’ll miss you,” Gu Ning said.

“Me too. Take good care of yourself,” Leng Shaoting said with concern.

“I will, and you have to take good care of yourself too!” Gu Ning said.

The next morning, Gu Qing and Gu Man were about to clear the mess left in the store, but were stopped by Gu Ning. Gu Ning planned to get the compensation from the person who had hired the bunch of hoodlums to damage their store first, and then open their store again.

Both Gu Qing and Gu Man completely trusted Gu Ning, so they agreed.

After lunch, Gu Ning pulled Gu Man to sit on the sofa. “Mom, I have something serious to talk to you about.”

“What is it?” Seeing Gu Ning being so serious, Gu Man was anxious.

“Well, it’s about my biological father,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Gu Man’s body abruptly stiffened for a second and she looked upset. “What happened?”

“Do you still remember that I told you that my biological father could be alive? That he lost his memory when you met him, so after the car accident, it is possible that he regained his memories but lost the memory of the year when you were together.”

“If he’s still alive, but just forgot what happened during the year when he was with you, if he’s not married yet, if he still loves you, if-I mean if you still have a chance to meet each other again, would you give it a try?” Gu Ning asked Gu Man again.

Gu Man was shocked, but she knew that Gu Ning asked her for a reason, and it was really possible that Ning was still alive.
