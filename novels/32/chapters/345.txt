Chapter 346 The Fight

The next day, Gu Ning got up at seven am to catch her plane which would take off at 9 am. Leng Shaoting had already prepared breakfast for her. After breakfast, he drove her to the airport.

When they were about to separate, Leng Shaoting gave Gu Ning a key. “This is the key to my house. I don’t stay in the capital all the time, but you can use it if you come here in the future.”

It showed his affection towards Gu Ning that he was willing to give her the key. Gu Ning took it without hesitation. She wouldn’t reject free high-end accommodations. However, she was going to buy her own house when she went to the university in the capital, which would give her a true sense of belonging.

Leng Shaoting had worried that Gu Ning wouldn’t take the key, but now he relaxed and felt happy.

“I’ll leave now,” Gu Ning reluctantly said to Leng Shaoting

“I’ll visit you after the New Year festival if I’m free.” Leng Shaoting was unwilling to leave her too, and he would rather tie her to his body so that they could be together forever.

“Great,” Gu Ning said, then she left. She went into the lounge, but it still was more than 10 minutes away from the departure time. Gu Ning thought for a while before calling Zhou Zhenghong. Zhou Zhenghong had nothing special to deal with today, so Gu Ning told him to pick her up at the airport of City G. Zhou Zhenghong of course wouldn’t turn her down.

After Gu Ning was gone, Leng Shaoting went back to the Leng Family’s house and gave his grandpa The Injured Lion.

Master Leng beamed with pleasure seeing The Injured Lion. However, once Master Leng heard that Leng Shaoting was going to leave for the military base soon, he was displeased and complained, “Do you seriously take this place as a hotel? Oh, no, you would at least stay at a hotel for a couple of days, but you’ve never stayed or even eaten at home during the days that you’ve been in the capital.”

Leng Shaoting understood that it was his fault that he hadn’t spent much time with his grandpa, so he said, “Well, then I’ll have lunch at home today before I leave.”

Hearing that, Master Leng was cheered up at once. “Very well! Come on, let’s play chess together.” It had been a long time since they had played chess together while chatting and drinking tea.

The plane that Gu Ning took landed at the airport of City G at around 12 pm. The moment she got off the plane, she called Leng Shaoting first and told him that she had arrived.

At this time, Leng Shaoting had just finished lunch and had left the Leng Family’s house. “Great. I’m going to the military base now, and I can’t use the phone while I’m on the base, so I’ll call once I’m free.”

“Alright, take care of yourself,” Gu Ning said.

She understood that any mobile phones or other equipment for communication were banned on the military base, in case enemies could figure out their location by tracking the satellite signals. Even if Leng Shaoting didn’t turn off his phone in the base, he still wouldn’t have reception there.

“You too, and I’ll miss you,” Leng Shaoting replied.

“Me too,” Gu Ning said.

After a short time of talking, they hung up.

When Gu Ning walked out of the exit, Zhou Zhenghong immediately walked forward to welcome her, “Nice to meet you, boss!”

“Nice to meet you too, Uncle Zhou,” Gu Ning.

“Please follow me this way,” Zhou Zhenghong said.

After they were in the car, Zhou Zhenghong said, “Boss, let’s go have a meal first!” It was almost 12:30 am, and Gu Ning had to be hungry.

“Alright,” Gu Ning said.

“Where are we going after the meal? I can decide where we’ll dine then,” Zhou Zhenghong asked.

“To the factory,” Gu Ning said.

“No problem.” Zhou Zhenghong drove to the direction of their factory at once. However, when they were passing an office building, they saw that a group of people were fighting. To be specific, a group of security guards were beating another group of men who were in ordinary clothes. There were approximately 50 of them in total.

All the security guards had steel sticks in hands, while those who were in ordinary clothes were empty-handed and were generally injured. It was very brutal that the security guards were beating them in public like that!

However, when Gu Ning noticed the company board with the name, Hongyun Real Estate on it, she realized why those security guards were so violent, and the reason for this mess.

She told Zhou Zhenghong to park the car at the roadside and made up her mind to get involved.

Although those migrant workers were employees of Hongyun Real Estate, and it was to Gu Ning’s advantage that the company was in a mess now, those migrant workers were innocent, and Gu Ning wouldn’t step aside just because they worked for Hongyun Real Estate.

“Boss, what are you going to do?” Zhou Zhenghong was puzzled.

“I’m going to help those migrant workers,” Gu Ning replied.

“The security guards all have steel sticks in their hands! It’s too dangerous!” Zhou Zhenghong was quite worried.

“I’ll be fine,” Gu Ning said. “You can stay in the car and call the ambulance. Many people here are injured. If the police come later and take me to the police station, don’t worry about me. I can handle it.”

After that, Gu Ning got out of the car and quickly strode towards the people in the fight.

Zhou Zhenghong was still worried, but he trusted Gu Ning. He knew that although Gu Ning was bold sometimes, she wouldn’t do anything which she couldn’t handle.

Gu Ning understood that it was useless to try to stop them by shouting, so she directly joined the fierce fight. She grabbed a steel stick from a security guard’s hand and kicked him away. Then she used the steel stick to knock the steel stick out of another security guard’s hands and also kicked him away.

“What the f*ck!” A nearby security guard was irritated and hit Gu Ning with the steel stick in his hand. However, before his hand could fall, Gu Ning caught it and broke it without delay. The security guard immediately screamed in great pain and the steel stick fell on the ground.

Afterwards, one after another the security guards were punched by Gu Ning within minutes, which shocked the crowd who were standing afar.

“Jesus! She is so awesome! How can she fight

against so many people alone!”

“Exactly! It’s so unbelievable!”

Hongyun Real Estate’s staff were also astonished. They didn’t expect that the situation would change so fast just because of a young girl.

After the security guards were all beaten down on the floor, the migrant workers also stepped aside. All of them were injured and one third of them were badly injured.

When it was almost over, the police cars finally arrived. However, even though they heard the police sirens, nobody stopped, because once a party stopped, the other party would take the advantage. Thus there had to be winners and losers.

Three police cars stopped at the roadside, and around 10 policemen got out. The leading policeman shouted, “Stop it! Stop right now!” However, no one listened to him.

“Bang!” The captain was mad and anxious. He shot the gun into the air, and those who were fighting finally stopped. However, only five security guards were still able to stand.

Meanwhile, a security guard tried to hit Gu Ning during the break, but was kicked a few meters away by Gu Ning, which shocked everyone again.

“How dare you fight in public? Get all of them back to the police station!” The captain didn’t ask what was going on at all, but directly arrested Gu Ning and the others. Apparently, he did it because of Hongyun Real Estate’s influence.

“Wait a second,” Gu Ning said and stopped them. The policemen who were approaching them unconsciously stopped. To some extent they were scared of this young girl who was standing in front of them because she alone had beaten down so many men.

“Do you want to resist?” the captain asked.

“I did beat them.” Gu Ning pointed at the group of security guards, then turned to the group of injured migrant workers. “But they were beaten by them. Thus why are you only arresting us? Can’t you see that they are injured? Aren’t they supposed to be sent to the hospital first?” Gu Ning was angry, so she wasn’t in the mood to be polite.

“You...” the captain was mad, but Gu Ning had told the truth. Those injured people were indeed supposed to be sent to the hospital first. Right then, three ambulances came.

“Take the injured to the hospital,” the captain ordered.

Hongyun Real Estate’s leaders didn’t come out until now, and then they told others to support the injured to get into the ambulances.

“Wait!” Gu Ning immediately stopped those who supported the injured security guards to ambulances. “I called those ambulances for the injured migrant workers only!”

“You...” They were annoyed.

“Stop being so cruel!” One of Hongyun Real Estate’s leaders said in anger.

“I’m being cruel? I think that we all know what is going on here,” Gu Ning sneered. “Besides, they were beaten by the security guards of Hongyun Real Estate, so Hongyun Real Estate has to pay for their medical expenses.”

“And you’ve injured our people too. You should pay their medical expenses too!” another man said.

“No, I just did it out of kindness. I think that I should be rewarded for that instead,” Gu Ning retorted. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

What Gu Ning had just said really aggravated the people from Hongyun Real Estate.

“You’re so unreasonable!” a leader of Hongyun said.

“Well, I think that the surveillance cameras will prove who is right,” Gu Ning said.

“Who do you think you are? Do you really think that you can hurt Hongyun?” another one of Hongyun’s leaders asked with disdain.

“Let’s go and see!” Gu Ning wasn’t afraid at all. She had the proof of Hongyun’s illegal behavior in her hands now. Sooner or later she would make Hongyun Real Estate go bankrupt.

After that, she ignored them, and helped the injured migrant workers to get in the ambulances.

And then the rest of the people, including Gu Ning were taken back to the police station.

Gu Ning understood that they wouldn’t release her once she was brought into the police station, unless she did something. However, before that, she still followed the policemen to get in the car.

She took out her phone to call someone the moment she was in the car. However, a policeman beside her tried to grab it. Hongyun had told them to “take good care of this young girl, so they absolutely had to stop her from calling for help.

Gu Ning avoided his hand and gave him a cold glance. The policeman was struck dumb all of a sudden. “I’m not a criminal, so you have no right to stop me from calling,” she said.

“So what? Do you think that anyone can save you after you’ve annoyed Hongyun?” the captain asked with disdain. Although he was scared of her outstanding skills at fighting, he believed that she was merely an ordinary girl without power. In addition, they had guns, so she wouldn’t dare to hurt them.

“Ha-ha, that’s interesting. Actually, there are many important figures in City G who can help me. If you still want to keep your job, I think that you better shut your mouth,” Gu Ning said arrogantly, as if Hongyun Real Estate was nothing in her eyes.

Although the policemen were snobbish, they weren’t dumb. Hearing what Gu Ning had just said, none of them dared to stop her again. If she truly had the support of important figures in City G, they would be digging their own graves if they annoyed her.

Gu Ning then directly called Yan Zhenglin.

“Hi, it’s rare hearing from you. Do you have a problem?” Yan Zhenglin was happy to receive Gu Ning’s call.
