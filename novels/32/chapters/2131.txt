Chapter 2133: Destroy the Files

“Sure, Miss Gu, thank you so much for reminding me. I’ll go to the high school they studied in to investigate the case.” Shao Chen immediately thanked Gu Ning and showed his attitude.

It seemed that he had to investigate it this time, or Gu Ning might file a complaint against him to his leader, and his career would be over.

Afterwards, Gu Ning left, but didn’t leave the hospital immediately. Instead, when she arrived at the parking lot, she sat in the car, took out the computer, turned it on, and plugged in the unlimited transmission connector of the miniature camera she installed in the fake Yang Jun’s ward, then she began to watch the movements in the room.

Gu Ning didn’t leave right away, but not because she would go to protect the fake Yang Jun by herself. She asked Gao Yi to come. She would hand her computer to him before leaving.

Once Gu Ning was gone, Shao Chen called Yang Siyuan.

“Siyuan, originally I didn’t intend to investigate this case, but Gu Ning just came. I have no choice, but to agree to the investigation. Don’t worry, the result will be the same. I’ll do a quick investigation to give her a reply.” Shao Chen said to Yang Siyuan. Up to now, he was still not suspicious of Yang Siyuan. He said that to him because he believed Yang Siyuan was innocent. However, upon hearing that, Yang Siyuan was in an absolute panic.

“What? Gu Ning went to the hospital? Why did she go to the hospital? Just to remind you to investigate the case about Yang Jun?” Yang Siyuan asked. His voice sounded a little anxious.

Shao Chen didn’t pay much attention to it, and replied. “Yeah, by the way, after she came, she talked to Yang Jun alone for a few minutes. I heard nothing nor did I ask anything about it.”

“Gu Ning must believe what Yang Jun said…” Yang Siyuan felt anxious. Even if Gu Ning believed what he said, they were merely strangers. Gu Ning wouldn’t help him!

“What? No way!” After hearing that, Shao Chen suddenly realized something wasn’t right. Although he said it wasn’t likely, he actually also felt that Gu Ning should believe what Yang Jun said, so she reminded him to investigate the case.

Why would Gu Ning believe it? It was ridiculous.

What he didn’t know was that Gu Ning believed it and had already found out the truth. She was sure Yang Jun was honest.

“How will you investigate it next?” Yang Siyuan did his best to calm himself down and asked calmly.

“Gu Ning told me I can go to your high school to see the student files if I want to know whether Yang Jun told the truth,” Shao Chen said. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Student files? If Shao Chen really did that, the truth would come out!

No, Yang Siyuan couldn’t allow it to happen. Even if Shao Chen could find their files, he must destroy them.

Now, he couldn’t let Shao Chen know about it. He must destroy the files before Shao Chen went to their school.

Without delay, Yang Siyuan made a call once he finished his call with Shao Chen.

Yang Siyuan happened to have a friend’s relative who worked in the academic affairs office of the high school he had studied in. Now Yang Siyuan had to take risks and let his friend delete the files of Yang Jun and Yang Siyuan.

He undoubtedly had to pay for that, but his friend loved money, so he was likely to succeed.

Without surprise, as soon as Yang Siyuan offered half a million yuan, his friend agreed, but he would only pay the money after it was done.

Then Yang Siyuan’s friend called his relative and promised to give him two hundred thousand yuan if he could delete the files of the two people. His relative immediately agreed.

Anyway, it was very normal to lose the files from seven or eight years ago. After so many years, no one bothered to manage them, so it could easily be done.

Therefore, when Shao Chen went to the high school where Yang Jun and Yang Siyuan had studied to see their student files, he got a reply that they were already lost.

In that case, Shao Chen naturally couldn’t find out the truth. After that, Shao Chen called Yang Siyuan and told him about it.

Although Yang Siyuan’s friend had already replied to him that it had been deleted, he was still not at ease before receiving news from Shao Chen. After hearing Shao Chen’s reply, he was finally relieved.

However, he still couldn’t feel completely at ease, because he was worried that Gu Ning would intervene in this case. He couldn’t understand why Gu Ning did that. There was no relationship between Yang Siyuan and her after all. Did she do that just because she was kind and helpful?

If that was the case, Gu Ning had connections, so he was afraid that she could find other evidence. As a result, he had to figure out a way to destroy other evidence if there was any.

If he couldn’t think of a good idea, he would directly make Yang Siyuan die in the hospital.

As of this moment, the real Yang Jun began to be mad at Gu Ning. Did she turn him down yesterday because she already believed Yang Siyuan’s words? Why would she choose to believe Yang Siyuan instead of him?

Gu Ning didn’t know that the real Yang Jun had asked people to delete the files of him and Yang Siyuan, but she already had evidence and wasn’t worried.

After Gu Ning left the hospital, she went to her company. After a while, it was time for lunch, so she returned to the siheyuan.

After having a meal, Jing Yunyao received a call from Jing Jining. He told her that Hong Yifeng was out of the cultivation world, but it wasn’t he who brought him out. Hong Yifeng came out because he learned that there was magical power in Colaine medicines and he came out for Colaine and Gu Ning.

Now many cultivators were aware of the magical power in Colaine medicines, but no one knew who spread the news.

Gu Ning wasn’t surprised, she knew it would soon go abroad.

However, in cultivators’ eyes, she was just a mortal, so they wouldn’t hurt her unless any of them wanted to break the rules in the cultivation world. If so, they would be punished if it was exposed.

There were so many cultivators who were spying on her right now. If any cultivator dared to hurt her, other cultivators would know about it right away. They would definitely report it to the elders. They weren’t on the same team, so they couldn’t wait to see their competitors have bad luck.

Since Hong Yifeng came out for Gu Ning, he would go to see her after he arrived at the capital. In that case, Gu Ning had an idea to catch him.

Thinking of that, she began to discuss it with Jing Yunyao.

Gu Ning would go to meet Hong Yifeng, and Jing Yunyao would show up afterwards to injure him. They could catch him before handing him to Miao Jingjing.

Shortly after they reached agreement, Gu Ning’s phone rang and it was a strange number.

“Hi, this is Gu Ning.” Gu Ning picked it up.

“Hello Miss Gu, my surname is Hong. I have a great business deal to talk about with you. Is it convenient for you to have a meeting?” a man said. His tone wasn’t very polite, containing a hint of arrogance. It seemed that he wasn’t looking for a cooperation with her. It sounded as if Gu Ning wished to cooperate with him.
