Chapter 1860: There Must Be a Mastermind

Now his plan failed, so Qu Yifei was unwilling to try again. He told Qu Hanjiao not to mess with Gu Ning.

Knowing that Qu Yifei had failed to teach Gu Ning a lesson, Qu Hanjiao was mad, but didn’t dare to blame her own older brother.

As for Qu Yifei’s exhortation, Qu Hanjiao listened to him and didn’t dare to do anything to Gu Ning again.

After that, Qu Hanjiao told Yuan Shuyan that her plan failed. Yuan Shuyan was furious too and blamed their uselessness, but she didn’t dare to say it aloud. After all, it had nothing to do with her, even though Qu Hanjiao used her to persuade Qu Yifei to pay Gu Ning back.

Gu Ning came in order to force those people to tell her the truth, because she couldn’t find evidence about the whole family that was slaughtered.

Given the result of K’s investigation, the businessman whose family was slaughtered hadn’t done anything unacceptable and his business enjoyed a good reputation.

Although it could prove that this businessman was completely innocent, Gu Ning would try to figure out the truth later.

She would force those suspects to tell her the truth unless they would rather die than be honest with her.

Gu Ning avoided the surveillance cameras around the villa, then stood outside it. She used her Jade Eyes to see inside and saw the six men playing cards in the living room.

Because there were many open windows, Gu Ning easily got into the villa.

After getting into it, she didn’t immediately show up in front of them, but released her magical power to freeze them first.

“F*ck, why is it suddenly so cold?”

“Right, it’s autumn, but it shouldn’t be so cold.”

“What the hell! Close the windows.”

Feeling the cold air entering their bodies, they swore with dissatisfaction. However, right when two men wanted to stand up to close windows, they suddenly found that their legs and feet were a little stiff.

“What happened? I can’t move my legs and feet.”

“Perhaps you’ve sat for too long.”

After that, the two men tried to relax their muscles, but only found that their limbs were getting more and more stiff.

The other men also felt uncomfortable. They couldn’t move no matter how they tried. As time went by, the inside of their bodies became uncomfortable as well.

“W-What’s going on?”

One man suddenly found it difficult to speak now. Once he moved, his limbs hurt, so he didn’t dare to move again.

“I-I can’t move either.”

Seeing every of them suffering the same thing, those men panicked.

Gu Ning only froze half of their bodies so that they couldn’t move. Afterwards, she showed up and turned on the camera with her.

Those men rounded their eyes in horror when they saw a woman suddenly appear in the villa.

Who is this woman? When did she appear?

They had no idea when she got inside. Besides, they started to doubt whether it was this woman who made their bodies stiff.

They thought it was a ridiculous idea, because they didn’t believe that this woman had any ability to make their bodies stiff. However, it was true that their bodies were getting stiffer and the woman showed up at this moment. It couldn’t be a coincidence.

“W-Who are you?” they asked Gu Ning.

“You don’t need to know that. You only need to answer my questions,” said Gu Ning in a cold voice. She deliberately changed her voice, because she was going to hand this video to the police. She had no intention of exposing herself.

“W-What?” they asked.

“Half a year ago, Fu Yongliang’s whole family was slaughtered. Was it done by you?” asked Gu Ning. Although she asked that question, she was already sure about the answer.

Hearing that, those men rounded their eyes in shock.

How does she know that?

Even though Gu Ning knew it, they refused to admit it.

“W-We don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“R-Right, we didn’t kill anyone!”

“...”

All six men denied it at once, but they showed obvious guilt in their expressions.

“Don’t you know that your guilty expressions have already betrayed you?” said Gu Ning mockingly.

Those men avoided her eyes in silence in case they made more mistakes.

“Tell me, why did you kill Fu Yongliang’s whole family?” asked Gu Ning in a serious tone. She glared at them, putting great pressure on them, which made it hard for them to breathe.

Who exactly is this woman? Why is she so powerful? Is she the reason why we can’t move now?

Although they were scared by Gu Ning, they still refused to admit it.

“We didn’t.”

“Yeah, we didn’t.”

They had worn masks while committing the crime, and the surveillance cameras had been damaged by them too. It had been half a year. Even the police failed to find out that it was them, so it meant that they hadn’t left any evidence.

They believed that Gu Ning was only suspicious of them. Even if she knew that they had done it, she could do nothing about it as long as they refused. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Gu Ning sneered. “Do you think that you can easily get away with it by wearing masks and damaging the surveillance cameras back then? No criminal can escape from the net of the law. If you don’t want anyone to know, you better not do it. I came to see you because I know that you’ve committed the crime. It’s useless no matter how you deny it. By the way, you should know that you can’t move now. It can’t be easier for me to kill you. Would you rather be killed than tell me the truth?”

Hearing that, those men trembled in fear.

They were undoubtedly afraid of death, but they might not be able to survive if they admitted it right now.

“I don’t have time to waste on you. If you don’t tell me the truth right now, I’m afraid you’ll beg me to kill you then,” said Gu Ning. She took a dagger on the table, then walked towards them step by step.

She had gloves on her hands, so she wasn’t afraid of being caught by leaving fingerprints.

Those men hesitated to make a choice.

Gu Ning went to the man with the scorpion tattoo on his neck. This man was their leader, so Gu Ning started directly from him.

Gu Ning’s dagger fell on the man’s neck. She coldly looked at him, and asked, “Are you going to tell me, or not?”

“I-I-I-I’ll tell you.” The man was scared, because he saw a pair of cruel and bloodthirsty eyes. He knew that she meant every word she just said.

“Then tell me,” said Gu Ning.

“W-We were paid to kill his family. Fu Yongliang stole another businessman’s project, s-so the businessman paid us to kill his family,” said the man.

Knowing that, Gu Ning squinted. It wasn’t surprising, because she already guessed that they must have been paid to kill. There must be a mastermind.

“Who is he?” asked Gu Ning.
