Chapter 2034: He Didn’t Really Hurt Me

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“What? There are people with special skills abroad as well?” Xi Baichuan was astonished.

“We have cultivators, ghosts, and all kinds of monsters. It’s not strange that people with special skills exist in foreign countries. Is it possible that Yin Shixun ran into one of them?” said Jing Jining.

Hearing that, Xi Baichuan and the other people pondered. It was indeed possible.

They had no right to interfere in mortal affairs, but it was necessary for them to investigate those people with special skills.

Foreign people with special skills weren’t only a threat to the country, but also to cultivators. They knew nothing about them right now, so they had no idea about their abilities.

Although they always believed that cultivators were extremely strong, they were only much stronger than mortals. Monsters or ghosts at a high level were threatening for them, so foreign people with special skills would become a greater threat.

“I’ll report it to our patriarch,” said Xi Baichuan.

Xi Baichuan stopped asking Jing Jining more questions, because they weren’t very suspicious of him and their suspicion was alleviated after talking with him. However, they still remained slightly suspicious of him, so Tiandaozong arranged for people to watch him after they left.

Those people who followed Jing Jining were at a higher level than him, so he couldn’t sense them, but he knew he would be followed after the meeting. Therefore, Jing Jining was particularly careful.

After meeting Tiandaozong, Jing Jining went straight back to the Jing family’s house and didn’t go out again.

Jing Jining stayed calm all the time, but he was actually quite nervous. Once his meeting with Tiandaozong was over, he took a breath of relief for the time being.

The moment Jing Jining was back in the Jing family’s house, the housekeeper told him to go to Jing Yaorong’s study. Jing Yaorong wanted to see him.

There was no need to ask, because Jing Jining knew it must be related to Yin Shixun’s death.

Jing Jining had to go because it was his family’s patriarch’s order.

In the study, in addition to Jing Yaorong, Jing Jining’s father, Jing Yanhua was also present.

Sitting in front of the main table, the man who seemed about 60 years old with a large mole under his right eye, was Jing Yaorong.

Sitting at the left side of the table, a man was also about 60. He was Jing Jining’s father, Jing Yanhua.

Jing Yaorong was years older than Jing Yanhua, but Jing Yanhua looked much older than Jing Yaorong because of the huge gap between their levels.

Jing Yaorong was in the middle stage of Yuan Ying Stage, while Jing Yanhua was just at the peak of the Golden Core Stage, so he aged faster, but both of them had actually lived for hundreds of years.

The higher level a cultivator was at, the longer he or she could live. They aged, but much slower than ordinary people.

Facing Jing Yaorong, Jing Jining was filled with hatred, but he couldn’t show his real feelings on his face because Jing Yaorong was the Jing family’s patriarch. He remained polite, but wasn’t very respectful. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Jing Yaorong also stared at Jing Jining expressionlessly, because he was aware that Jing Jining hated him. Jing Jining was close to Jing Yunyao, but he killed her.

He didn’t kill Jing Yunyao publicly, but everyone in the Jing family clearly knew his character. Even if he said nothing, they all knew that he had cruelly killed Jing Yunyao.

Jing Yaorong never regretted killing Jing Yunyao because Jing Yunyao had humiliated him.

Looking at Jing Jining, Jing Yanhua was worried because he was his beloved son. Jing Yanhua was unwilling to see Jing Jining involved in Yin Shixun’s death.

“Hi, Patriarch, father,” Jing Jining called them.

“What happened? Do you have anything to do with Yin Shixun’s death?” asked Jing Yaorong seriously. Although it was good news for them, he didn’t want the Jing family to be in trouble.

“No, I just met him before he died. He left after injuring me. I don’t know how he died,” said Jing Jining calmly.

Hearing that, Jing Yaorong and Jing Yanhua were convinced.

Nevertheless, Jing Yanhua was mad when he learned that Yin Shixun had injured Jing Jining. “Are you alright now?” he asked with concern.

“I’m fine. He didn’t really hurt me and he’s dead now,” said Jing Jining, so he had no hatred towards Yin Shixun now.

…

It was already 7 pm when Gu Ning and the others arrived at the airport of the capital. Before they got on board, Leng Shaoting called Stone and told him to pick them up at the airport before 7 pm. Therefore, before they arrived, Stone was already waiting for them there. So once they walked out, they left the airport.

They had eaten some food on the plane, but they still needed to have dinner so they went to look for a restaurant.

Along the way, Jing Yunyao was worried about Jing Jining’s condition, so she turned on her phone as soon as she left the plane to see whether Jing Jining had called or sent her any messages. She saw nothing, but it only made her more worried.

Gu Ning and the others were anxious as well, so they didn’t know how to comfort Jing Yunyao.

Back to the city center, Gu Ning called Tang Haifeng, then Gu Man. She told them that she was back and asked about Gu Man’s condition.

Gu Man had been pregnant for 6 months now. Her belly was large, so it became inconvenient for her to move now. Luckily, she was very healthy.

Afterwards, Gu Ning chatted with Chu Peihan and her other friends in the WeChat group. She hadn’t shown up in the WeChat group for a long time, so her sudden appearance aroused everyone’s criticism. However, they weren’t really mad at Gu Ning because they knew she was very busy.

They went to a restaurant which was famous for delicious local dishes. Because it was late, there weren’t many diners so Gu Ning and the others didn’t wait for a long time before their order was done.

After having dinner, they went back to siheyuan.

Jing Yunyao already made it to the Out-of-body Stage from concrete to abstract, but she was seriously injured during the lightning tribulation. She was still physically weak and would be weaker than she was at Yuan Ying Stage, so it was safer for her to stay in siheyuan.

It was Monday, but Gu Ning didn’t go to school because she needed to deal with something else. Once she finished dinner at siheyuan, she went to her company without Leng Shaoting because they shouldn’t wander around at this time now.

There were cultivators near Gu Ning’s company, school, and houses, so Leng Shaoting would be easily discovered if he went out with Gu Ning.

…

At noon, Jing Jining left the cultivation world as well because he was worried that Jing Yunyao might be concerned about him.. He had to let her know that he was safe.
