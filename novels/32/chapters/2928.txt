2929 Time to Pay Back

After Mr. You was gone, Gu Ning turned to stare at Long Weixiong silently, waiting for his response.

Long Weixiong suddenly didn’t know how to answer Gu Ning. He was reluctant to give in, but he was left with no choice.

“Leader Long, if you refuse to tell me, I’m afraid I can only use violence.” Long Weixiong remained silent for quite a while, so Gu Ning lost her patience.

“Please don’t!” Long Weixiong finally yielded. “It’s true that I ordered Zhang Quanliang to do that, but I was paid too. The real mastermind is the heir of the Huang family, Huang Yuwen. As for the reason, I have no idea why he wants to do that,” Long Weixiong said.

“The Huang family? What do they do?” Gu Ning asked. She was unfamiliar with major families in City H.

“They’re the richest people in City H,” Long Weixiong replied.

“Do you have evidence to prove it’s Huang Yuwen?” Gu Ning asked.

“Of course I do. We always keep evidence when we receive tasks like that in order to protect ourselves if it’s exposed,” Long Weixiong said.

They were illegal gangs, so they had to learn to protect themselves. Within their abilities, they would do their best to keep the mastermind a secret, but once they were no longer safe, they had to betray the mastermind.

Although they were paid to do the task, they were unwilling to risk their lives for it.

Afterwards, Long Weixiong took out his phone and played a voice recording. It was his conversation with Huang Yuwen.

Huang Yuwen didn’t say much in the recording. He only promised to give Long Weixiong a certain amount of money and ordered him to attack a car at a place.

He didn’t give Long Weixiong any other details. Long Weixiong didn’t ask either. After all, he was paid to do the task. There was no need for him to know more.

Actually, even though Huang Yuwen didn’t tell him, he found out about the target’s background on his own. It was an important figure, but he still agreed to do the task because Huang Yuwen paid him a lot.

Most importantly, Long Weixiong didn’t think anyone would find out the truth.

“Give me your phone.” Gu Ning held her hand to Long Weixiong.

“What do you want to do?” Long Weixiong asked. There are many secrets on his phone.

“I only want this voice recording. I won’t read other information on your phone,” Gu Ning said.

Long Weixiong was doubtful, but had to give his phone to Gu Ning because he wouldn’t be able to keep it to himself.

Once Gu Ning had Long Weixiong’s phone, she immediately sent the voice recording to her email box. Then she downloaded the file on her phone and deleted the email in Long Weixiong’s phone before giving his phone back to him.

Although it wasn’t difficult for Long Weixiong to recover it, Gu Ning wasn’t worried.

After returning Long Weixiong’s phone to him, Gu Ning stopped making it difficult for him. However, before she walked away, she still warned him. “If you gave me the wrong answer, I’ll come back to you.”

As soon as she finished, Gu Ning left. Long Weixiong didn’t dare to stop her, nor did he report it to Huang Yuwen after she left.

It was impossible for him to be on good terms with Huang Yuwen after he betrayed him. Besides, they might become enemies, so he said nothing. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

…

After Gu Ning left, she asked K to help her collect information about Huang Yuwen, because she knew nothing about him.

After K found out where the Huang family lived and got some of Huang Yuwen’s photos, he verified where Huang Yuwen was, and Gu Ning went to see him at once.

The Tiger Gang soon heard what happened to Long Weixiong. Its leader had no idea what task he had agreed to do, but he didn’t think it was wrong. Since they were an illegal gang, it was their job to kill when they were paid.

However, if anything went wrong, they needed to take responsibility.

Luckily, no major damage was caused. If the Tiger Gang was really ruined, their leader would kill Long Weixiong.

…

As the richest family in City H, the Huang family lived in a large house with security guards and surveillance cameras.

When Gu Ning arrived, it was already 10 pm.

It wasn’t too late, so the Huang family was still up.

Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to look around the house first to check where Huang Yuwen was. She wouldn’t take action until she found him.

At that moment, Huang Yuwen was reading documents in a room on the third floor.

Although there were many security guards and surveillance cameras in the Huang family’s house, Gu Ning still easily got inside and climbed up to the window of Huang Yuwen’s room.

Because it was hot during summer, Huang Yuwen opened the window and there were no burglar bars. It was bullet-proof glass, so people normally couldn’t break it and no one would dare to steal anything from his house.

After all, there were many security guards and surveillance cameras, ordinary people would easily be caught if they dared to sneak inside, but it was useless in Gu Ning’s eyes.

She didn’t go in right after climbing up to the window. Instead, she released cold magical power to attack Huang Yuwen first. She decided to freeze his body.

After being attacked by a cold magical power, Huang Yuwen immediately felt cold, but he didn’t pay much attention to it. He just thought that he had sat still for too long, so his body became a little stiff. Therefore, he stopped working and rested for a while.

However, he soon realized that his condition only got worse. He wanted to pick up his phone to call his family, but his whole body hurt the moment he moved. Luckily, he successfully reached his phone.

However, right at that moment, Gu Ning showed up and took his phone away.

Huang Yuwen was shocked when he saw a girl suddenly appear. Who was she? Why did she suddenly show up in his home? She didn’t make any sound! Did she cause his body to stiffen?

If it was related, how did she make it happen? It was unbelievable! If not, why did he suddenly feel stiff all over?

“Who are you?” Huang Yuwen questioned.

He could speak, but his voice was hoarse so he couldn’t shout.

“It’s time for you to pay back,” Gu Ning said.

“What? I don’t owe you anything,” Huang Yuwen said. He knew that this girl wasn’t a friendly visitor, so he must have hurt her before.

He had done too many bad things, so he wasn’t surprised if any of those victims came to see him, but he didn’t expect the person to be so strong.
