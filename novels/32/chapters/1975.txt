“Hi, any good news? You look very excited!” Seeing Gu Ning’s happy face, Leng Shaoting smiled at her. In addition, Gu Ning looked a little different from her usual look, so Leng Shaoting believed there must be good news.

“Yes. Why don’t you guess first?” Gu Ning deliberately mystified it.

Leng Shaoting thought for a while, but soon gave up. “Just tell me!”

“Well, let me ask you what do you want most to happen to me right now?” asked Gu Ning.

Hearing that, an idea dawned on Leng Shaoting, but he didn’t think it was possible. Nevertheless, that seemed to be the only thing he wanted to happen to Gu Ning. Could it be that?

Leng Shaoting squinted at Gu Ning with mixed emotions. Staring straight at her, he obviously tried to see something from her body, but failed.

Seeing Leng Shaoting’s expression, Gu Ning knew he already had the answer but simply wasn’t sure of it.

Leng Shaoting indeed wasn’t sure of it, so he didn’t dare to say it aloud in case Gu Ning would be upset if he was wrong.

When Leng Shaoting hesitated to say it, Gu Ning stopped making him suffer and said right away, “I crossed the boundary of cultivation last night. I’m a cultivator now.”

She could have told Leng Shaoting last night, but she decided to wait till they met each other today.

“Really?” Leng Shaoting instantly got excited.

He was thinking about that too, because it was the only thing that he hoped to happen to Gu Ning which could fill her with so much excitement. After all, they didn’t lack anything now, nor did they have any difficulties, so that was the only thing they hoped to see.

At the same time, Leng Shaoting was worried that he might be wrong, so he hesitated to say it aloud. He didn’t want Gu Ning to misunderstand him and be upset.

Even though he had thought about that possibility, he wasn’t sure of it, so he felt shocked and thrilled when he heard the answer from Gu Ning.

Without caring that Shangguan Yang was also in the yard, Leng Shaoting pulled Gu Ning into his arms right away.

“Well, well…” Seeing that, Shangguan Yang moved his eyes away with slight embarrassment. He was an ancient man after all, so he wasn’t as open-minded as the people in modern society.

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning had no time to care about Shangguan Yang’s feelings at this moment.

“Yes!” Gu Ning was excited too, and almost cried out.

Leng Shaoting wanted to do something more intimate to Gu Ning, but he forced himself to calm down and let her go.

When they saw Shangguan Yang, they felt embarrassed.

“Brilliant! That’s really good news! How did you manage to become a cultivator?” asked Leng Shaoting with curiosity.

“In fact, there is one thing I’ve kept a secret from you. Grandpa Shangguan and your mother are aware of it. I just wanted to surprise you after I become a cultivator,” said Gu Ning, then she told Leng Shaoting about the Blood of the Phoenix.

However, she didn’t tell him that she was reborn, which was still a secret she wouldn’t tell him.

Because Leng Shaoting was aware of her Jade Eyes, she told him the Blood of the Phoenix was the Jade Eyes. Therefore, Leng Shaoting wasn’t so astonished. Moreover, Leng Shaoting was a cultivator, so he no longer thought it was too unbelievable to be true.

“When I got the Blood of the Phoenix, I heard someone saying in my mind. ‘There’s a piece of ancient jade named the Blood of the Phoenix. It’s made of the blood of a phoenix and the soul of the earth. It has magical power, which enables you to live forever or be reborn.'”

“Grandpa Shangguan told me I don’t need to suffer the pain of cutting bones and purifying marrow with the help of the Blood of the Phoenix, but I need to move its magical power into my energy center. Only after I successfully store it in my body can I keep on cultivating, so I’ve been trying these days. Although I’ve failed countless times, I never gave up. Last night, I suddenly succeeded,” said Gu Ning. She decided not to tell Leng Shaoting that she had been injured by the interruption of her cultivation. She was fine now anyway, so there was no need for her to say that.

Shangguan Yang understood that, so he didn’t bother to tell the truth.

“What a surprise!” said Leng Shaoting. He had no intention of blaming Gu Ning for not telling him earlier, even if he was in a bad mood because of that these days.

It was great news that Gu Ning was a cultivator now.

“I haven’t told your mother yet. I need to call her now. You can go to pick her up later, and we’ll have a meal together here,” said Gu Ning.

“Sure,” Leng Shaoting said.

After that, Gu Ning went to give Jing Yunyao a call.

Jing Yunyao was also excited when she heard that Gu Ning had already become a cultivator.

Gu Ning told Jing Yunyao that Leng Shaoting would go to pick her up later and that they would have a meal at the siheyuan. Jing Yunyao, however, said that she might not be able to come because Jing Jining was coming to see her in a while.

Gu Ning then told Jing Yunyao to invite Jing Jining to have the meal together with them at the siheyuan.

Jing Jining was Jing Yunyao’s older cousin and Leng Shaoting’s uncle. He wasn’t an outsider anyway, so it wasn’t a bad thing to let him meet Shangguan Yang.

When Jing Yunyao asked for Jing Jining’s opinion, Jing Jining was more than willing to visit Shangguan Yang. Actually, he always had that idea after knowing that Shangguan Yang was still alive, but he didn’t know how to say it. After all, Shangguan Yang enjoyed a much higher status than him, and not everyone could see him.

Since Jing Jining had the chance now, he wouldn’t miss it.

Jing Yunyao didn’t tell Jing Jining that Gu Ning already became a cultivator, because she wasn’t sure whether she could tell him. If Gu Ning wanted him to know, she would tell him in person at the siheyuan.

After the rush hour in the morning at 9 am, Leng Shaoting drove to Mountain River Garden to pick up Jing Yunyao and Jing Jining.

Jing Jining arrived in the capital yesterday and stayed in a hotel opposite Mountain River Garden, because he planned to dine with Jing Yunyao at noon to talk about something.
