Although there was a big difference between Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao’s status and it was impossible for them to be together realistically, they cared about love more than status.

In addition, given Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities, she would be a powerful person sooner or later.

Therefore, Mu Yiyang thought that Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen were a perfect couple given their appearances and abilities.

“Alright, stop there.” Before Mu Yiyang finished, Li Mochen interrupted him and warned him with a cold glance. Mu Yiyang immediately shut his mouth, but it was really uncomfortable to have to keep it to himself.

Afterwards, Li Mochen said to Leng Xiaoyao, “Xiaoyao, please don’t be mad. What they said is completely nonsense.”

Even though Li Mochen understood that Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care about that, he still said that to comfort her. However, even he didn’t notice that he actually said it in a fit of pique.

Back in the hotel, Leng Xiaoyao and the others returned to their own rooms.

Lying in bed, Li Mochen couldn’t sleep. He remembered the picture that had appeared in his mind before. In the picture, the girl who looked exactly the same as Leng Xiaoyao angrily pointed and shouted at him.

Perhaps because he kept on thinking of the picture before he slept, he dreamed about the picture after falling asleep.

This time, he clearly heard her voice.

“Li Mochen, tell your people to stay away from me. I want to hang out. I can enjoy myself as I want. You have no power to restrict me.”

It sounded so similar to Leng Xiaoyao’s voice, but the tone and attitude were different from the Leng Xiaoyao he met right now.

After having the dream, Li Mochen abruptly woke up, then he began to think about it.

Why? Was this girl Leng Xiaoyao? Was it just an illusion or reality? Was there really a thing like a previous incarnation which Leng Xiaoyao had mentioned?

Did Leng Xiaoyao treating him so well have something to do with the previous incarnation?

Was it true that Leng Xiaoyao owed him in the previous incarnation?

Tonight, Li Mochen couldn’t sleep. He didn’t even sleep for three hours by the time the sky was bright.

At 7 am, everyone got up and packed up.

Before 7:40 am, they gathered together at the front hall and set off.

At 9 am, Shen Yaping called Shen Yamei. After making sure that she was home, he visited her with Shen Xiyao and Shen Xiyin.

Shen Yaping told Shen Yamei that he needed to speak to her about something, so Shen Yamei had no idea that her scheme was already exposed and didn’t think it had something to do with Shen Xiyin nor did she feel anxious.

She didn’t know why her older brother wanted to see her, but she would find out later.

Shen Yamei’s family wasn’t far from the Shen family, so they arrived about twenty minutes later.

Shen Yamei’s husband’s family was very ordinary, but she had received 10% of the Shen family’s businesses as the daughter. Therefore, she was rich too and lived in an expensive block.

In addition, with the help of the Shen family, Shen Yamei’s husband had a successful business now.

Shen Yamei didn’t have a job, so she got up late.

Although she didn’t have a job, she received a dividend from the Shen family’s businesses. She also bought many stores and houses. By renting them out, she could make a lot of rent every year.

Therefore, she hung out all day with her friends, shopping and taking care of her skin.

Because Shen Yamei knew that her older brother was coming, she didn’t sleep late. Without delay, she got up quickly. Even if it was only her older brother, she still tidied herself up carefully.

By the time Shen Yaping and the others arrived, Shen Yamei wasn’t done yet, but she had asked the domestic servant to entertain them.

About a dozen minutes later, Shen Yamei came downstairs.

Shen Yamei understood that Shen Yaping would come, but she was surprised to see Shen Xiyao and Shen Xiyin. Besides, they looked angry. Somehow she had a premonition.

“Brother Yaping, Xiyao, Xiyin, why did you all come? Did anything happen?” asked Shen Yamei.

“Tell your domestic servant to go out for a while,” Shen Yaping said, curbing his anger.

Hearing that, Shen Yamei was even more nervous, but she still asked the domestic servant to go out. She was afraid that Shen Yaping would say something to embarrass her and she didn’t want the domestic servant to hear it.

After the domestic servant went out, only the Shen family’s members were in the living room. Shen Yaping lost his temper and questioned Shen Xiyin. “Shen Yamei, my family has never hurt you before and we never hesitate to help you. It’s fine that you’re not grateful, but why did you try to harm Shen Xiyin”

Shen Yamei was scared when Shen Yaping shouted her name. She immediately realized that this wasn’t a friendly visit.

After hearing Shen Yaping’s words, Shen Yamei was shocked and trembled in fear.

Her older brother already knew that she had tried to harm Shen Xiyin. Was Lu Laosan exposed?

“Brother Yaping, w-what do you mean?” Before making it clear, Shen Yamei didn’t want to admit it, so she played dumb.

However, because she was guilty, her voice was trembling.

“What do you mean? Am I not clear enough? Or do you think you can get away with it by playing dumb?” Shen Yaping was angry. In his opinion, Shen Yamei was simply a contemptible wretch making trouble.

“Brother Yaping, you got me wrong. I would never harm Xiyin.” Shen Yamei continued to deny it. However, in front of the powerful Shen Yaping, Shen Yamei lacked confidence.

“Do you think I came to see you without evidence?” Shen Yaping asked coldly. Afterwards, he took out his phone and played the voice recording.

When Shen Yamei heard the voice recording of her conversation with Lu Laosan, she was too scared to stand steadily and her face turned deathly pale.

How did they have a voice recording of her conversation with Lu Laosan?

“What do you want to say now?” asked Shen Yaping.

Shen Yamei remained silent because she didn’t know what to say after the evidence was placed on the table.

“You even tried to use evil power. Good for you. After you failed once, you even asked the man called Lu Laosan to take action by himself” Shen Yaping was so furious that he was out of breath.

Shen Yamei still said nothing because she honestly didn’t know what to say. She was in a total mess right now and had no idea how to face Shen Yaping and the others.
