3090 It’s Unbelievable

“Thank you, Miss Shen. Please let me buy the coffee for you later,” Leng Xiaoyao offered.

“Sure, you can pay the bill,” Shen Xiyin said. A cup of coffee wouldn’t cost much, so Shen Xiyin accepted it.

They didn’t know the size or the value of the jade yet. If Shen Xiyin turned Leng Xiaoyao down right now, Leng Xiaoyao would be embarrassed. Leng Xiaoyao looked so calm that she shouldn’t care about the result very much. In that case, there was no need for Shen Xiyin to be worried.

Even if they weren’t sure of the size yet, many people asked Leng Xiaoyao whether she was willing to sell it after knowing the type.

!!

However, Leng Xiaoyao definitely wouldn’t sell it.

If she couldn’t find real antiques later, she would give the jade to Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng as a gift.

The raw jade material was still being cut. After another cut, a larger area of green showed. It was the size of two palms. This time, it was highly likely for it to be a valuable jade. No one doubted whether it was big enough to make a lot of money.

If they said that right now, they would appear too jealous of Leng Xiaoyao and would be embarrassed by the result.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t look excited, but Shen Xiyin and the others felt excited for her, especially since before the jade was fully cut out, anything could happen.

However, after another cut, the jade only became larger, so no one thought there would be accidents anymore. At the same time, they became more envious of Leng Xiaoyao.

“Wow, she can make a fortune today.”

“Right, I’m so envious of her.”

“Why does she have such good luck? I’ve never been so lucky before.”

“She’s not only lucky, she is also very rich. And she has skills and courage too. If someone had told you there is high quality jade in this raw jade material, would you have the courage and money to buy it?”

“You’re right. Money is most important. After all, no one can be brave without money. Gu Yankai is a great example.”

“Yeah, Gu Yankai is an excellent master’s student. He has cut out several pieces of jade too, but he doesn’t have money now, so he can’t buy any raw jade materials even if he looks around here all the time these days.”

“He had bad luck and was trapped by his younger brother and mother.”

“Poor thing!”

Leng Xiaoyao heard their discussion clearly and felt that history was always repeating itself.

Among Gu Ning’s subordinates, many failed due to an accident or a scheme, then they met Gu Ning and their lives totally changed.

They never kept it a secret, so it was known to many people. After all, they didn’t think it was embarrassing. Instead, they kept it in mind and always felt grateful to Gu Ning.

Gu Yankai also heard their discussion, and felt extremely awkward. He couldn’t stand it any longer and snapped at them. “Enough! How could you discuss me right in front of my face? Can’t you see me?”

Actually, his story wasn’t a secret in this place and he had heard a lot worse before, so he kind of got used to it, but it didn’t mean he could accept it.

Three years had passed, but he could never get over it.

Therefore, he cut off his relationship with his mother and younger brother, otherwise he might lose control of himself and kill them.

Normally, parents cared about their kids, but some parents were even crueler than strangers.

Besides, it wasn’t his biological mother, it was his step mother.

Hearing Gu Yankai’s voice, they shut up at once, feeling embarrassed.

They saw Gu Yankai, so they talked about him. If they hadn’t seen him, they might not have mentioned him.

In fact, they didn’t do it on purpose, they only remembered his story.

Because most people were attracted to the jade, they paid little attention to Gu Yankai afterwards.

Before long, the jade was cut out.

Leng Xiaoyao paid eight million yuan for this half-cut raw jade material, but the jade in it was worth at least twenty million yuan. In other words, she made a fortune!

“Jesus, how much is it worth?”

“I think it’s worth at least ten million yuan. After all, it’s confederate rose at middle-high level so it won’t be cheap.”

“I’m so envious of her right now.”

“Me too!”

“…”

Everyone was envious of Leng Xiaoyao.

“Miss Leng, it’s incredible!” Shen Xiyin complimented. She really admired Lady Ning for her abilities and good luck. Anyway, it was amazing that Leng Xiaoyao could cut out high-quality jade.

“Thank you, Miss Shen. I have good luck today,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She couldn’t tell Shen Xiyin that she had magical senses.

“Whether it’s your luck or abilities, you’re unbelievable, Miss Leng,” Shen Xiyin said.

Leng Xiaoyao smiled but said nothing.

“Miss, will you sell the jade?” Someone asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“I’m sorry. This is a gift for my family. I won’t sell,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Shen Xiyin also wanted to buy it, but she gave up since Leng Xiaoyao had no intention of selling it.

Shen Xiyin’s family was very rich, and they didn’t lack money, but it was difficult to cut out jade, so the Shen family didn’t have extra jade to give to Shen Xiyin.

Then, Leng Xiaoyao’s second raw jade material was cut out.

Although they didn’t think Leng Xiaoyao’s good luck could help her get two pieces of jade, they were looking forward to seeing the result after the first piece of jade.

In addition, they were more nervous at this time.

After the raw jade material was cut out, purple jade showed.

“V-Violet?” The stone cutter was shocked again. He abruptly turned to look at Leng Xiaoyao to observe her.

Who was this girl? She was able to find jade and extremely valuable jade at that. It was amazing!

Hearing the stone cutter’s words, everyone was surprised as well.

...

What? Violet?

Everyone subconsciously turned to look at Leng Xiaoyao with admiration and jealousy.

Leng Xiaoyao stayed calm as usual. There was only a little smile on her lips. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Jesus, it’s unbelievable! A piece of confederate rose was just cut out, and now there is a piece of violet.”
