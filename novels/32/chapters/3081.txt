3082 Abnormal People Don’t Deserve Normal Thoughts

Although Leng Xiaoyao didn’t end their engagement because she found a better man, he believed she dumped him in order to ride on a richer man’s coattails.

Besides, he believed that Leng Xiaoyao didn’t really like him in the past. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have kept her abilities secret from him.

If he had known her abilities and her beauty, he wouldn’t have agreed to end their engagement even though he disliked her. Anyway, he would have felt extremely satisfied that his fiancée was outstanding inside and outside.

However, upon thinking that Leng Xiaoyao didn’t really like him, Chu Jianan felt humiliated. It was hard for him to accept the truth. If Leng Xiaoyao didn’t really like him, why wouldn’t she let him go in the past?

!!

Did she do it on purpose to make him hate her?

If so, why did she refuse to end their engagement when he wanted to?

Chu Jianan blamed Leng Xiaoyao for everything right now. Therefore, he asked himself why Leng Xiaoyao treated him like that.

…

“Of course. We’re all beautiful. I don’t believe that Yaoyao would be ugly,” Leng Changyuan said with pride. It was true that everyone in the Leng family was very beautiful.

“I think Yaoyao is the most beautiful in our family right now. She’s too attractive to be ignored even in a crowd,” Leng Yecheng said, and it wasn’t even an exaggeration.

Reality also proved that Leng Xiaoyao was indeed too attractive to be ignored.

Hearing Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng’s compliments, Song Meiyu and the others were even more displeased.

They refused to admit it, but they couldn’t deny that Leng Yecheng was right. Once Leng Xiaoyao covered her freckles, she was even prettier than Leng Yuqi.

“Uncle Yecheng, stop complimenting me, otherwise I’ll become too proud of myself,” Leng Xiaoyao joked, but she was actually quite modest.

“Ha-ha, you should be proud of yourself. You should love and cherish yourself, so that you won’t easily fall in love just because someone compliments you. It’s a good way to get rid of bad men,” Leng Yecheng said. He was most worried about Leng Xiaoyao’s marriage now. In his eyes, Leng Xiaoyao was the best. Ordinary men didn’t deserve her.

He was criticizing Chu Jianan as well, so Song Meiyu and the others were unhappy, but it was true that Chu Jianan was a bad man when he dated Leng Xiaoyao.

Anyway, they still accepted Chu Jianan. Instead, they believed Leng Xiaoyao was very lucky to win Chu Jianan’s interest, because Leng Yuqi was prettier than her, better than her at studying, and was also very accomplished.

In fact, they invested a lot of money and energy into Leng Yuqi in order to marry her into a family of higher status.

Therefore, no matter whom Chu Jianan had betrayed, it was good enough as long as he treated Leng Yuqi nicely.

“Don’t worry, I won’t make the same mistake again, otherwise I’ll be making a joke out of myself,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

However, Leng Xiaoyao also knew that good men were rare in this world nowadays. Most men were good at pretending, and sometimes women lost their reason when in love. Therefore, it was hard not to make mistakes again.

Nevertheless, Leng Xiaoyao had no intention of falling in love in this time space, because she would leave sooner or later. If she was in love, it would only cause her to suffer when she had to leave her love.

Moreover, she was very young. She was only eighteen years old, so she could wait till she was over twenty years old. She was busy studying and starting up a company right now. She also needed to complete her redemption.

Actually, given her quality, she deserved a quality man like Li Mochen…

Suddenly, Leng Xiaoyao’s heart dropped a beat when she thought of Li Mochen. Why did he appear in her mind at this moment?

However, she had to admit that Li Mochen was the man who satisfied her needs most till now, even if she didn’t clearly know his background. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Even though she wasn’t clear about his background, she didn’t want to collect information about him. After all, Li Mochen was also skilled at hacking, so he would know if she hacked into his computer. In that case, he might become suspicious of her.

It hadn’t been easy for her to win Li Mochen’s trust.

“It’s too early to say that. Once you’re attracted to a man, it’s not up to reason,” Leng Yuchen said. He didn’t think Leng Xiaoyao was smart when she said that.

Leng Yecheng suddenly remembered Xi Keyi, and he had to agree with Leng Yuchen.

He was almost trapped because of love. He had no idea that his girlfriend formed a romantic relationship with him for a purpose back then.

“I don’t think so. Before you know that your partner is terrible, it’s understandable that you do everything for your partner, but if you can’t leave the person after knowing that he or she is terrible, it’ll be your problem. In this world, no one can’t live without anyone. Everyone is busy. There is no need to waste time on meaningless things. Only people who have nothing to do will devote themselves to love. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Why can’t we leave a terrible person for a better one? If that happens, I think birds of a feather flock together. You can’t understand an abnormal person with normal thoughts,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

The mistake she meant was that she didn’t know that her boyfriend was a terrible man before they were together. Some people changed in a romantic relationship, but she would quickly make the decision to leave him once she found out he was a terrible person.

For example, Leng Xiaoyao tried to win Chu Jianan’s love although she knew he disliked her. After she tried, he still had no interest in her, so it was time for her to give up.

She shouldn’t wait till Chu Jianan betrayed her and had an affair with Leng Yuqi. Honestly, even Leng Xiaoyao disdained herself for what she had done, but now she would never do such a thing again. Even if she met her Mr. Right, she would still have her own principles.

Hearing Leng Xiaoyao’s words, both Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng were satisfied. She had finally become mature. In that case, they didn’t need to be worried about her life.

However, Leng Yuchen’s family disagreed.

“Why didn’t you give Chu Jianan up when you knew he disliked you? You wasted a lot of time on him.” Leng Yuchen mocked. In his eyes, Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t smart, so it was funny when she acted mature now.
