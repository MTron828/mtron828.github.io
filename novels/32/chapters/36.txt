Chapter 37: In the Fight

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I’m always confident.” Gu Ning didn’t want to hide her confidence.

“You...” Gu Xiaoxiao hated Gu Ning most when she stayed so calm before the storm came. Gu Xiaoxiao wanted to tear Gu Ning apart, “Gu Ning, keep pretending! I’ll go and see how you become a loser right before my eyes! And if you don’t apologize for what you’ve done yesterday, you’ll pay for it! ”

Gu Xiaoxiao clenched her teeth out of anger and hatred.

“I will never apologize. Do whatever you want to. I’m waiting,” Gu Ning replied airily. Then she ignored Gu Xiaoxiao, throwing her a provocative look, and walked away.

“You...” Gu Xiaoxiao was mad. She didn’t expect Gu Ning would dare to do that. She shouted at Gu Ning back, “Great, Gu Ning, you’ll regret!”

“Gu Ning, is it really going to be alright?” Yu Mixi asked in worry. She was concerned Gu Ning and her mother would be homeless.

“Don’t worry. It’s fine,” Gu Ning replied.

Gradually, Yu Mixi had pure trust in Gu Ning. Since Gu Ning had said it would be fine, she would not doubt it.

Mu Ke gave Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao a cold glance, then went back to his classroom.

Some students still believed Gu Ning would not come to school today. When Gu Ning showed up, they were all surprised.

Wasn’t Gu Ning afraid at all?

In the morning, Gu Ning had received many curious looks from others, their head teacher included. They all wanted to see fear from Gu Ning’s face, but failed. Gu Ning was at ease, like nothing had happened.

When the last class in the morning was about to over, the head teacher couldn’t help asking Gu Ning, “Are you really that confident?”

“I never do anything without being fully-prepared,” Gu Ning answered with solemnity.

The head teacher had nothing else to say. She left in quietness.

The appointed time was 1 pm. Gu Ning decided to eat first after the classes were over.

When Gu Ning and her friends went upstairs, Hao Ran and his friends stopped them. They actually didn’t mean to limit Gu Ning’s freedom. They simply followed Gu Ning in case she would run away.

Gu Ning felt resigned. Could anyone has any trust on her?

“Do you plan to buy me, your boss, a meal first?” Gu Ning looked at them, joking. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Gu Ning, don’t be so confident. It’s too early to say that,” Hao Ran retorted. Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping glared at Gu Ning at the same time.

Actually, those three boys weren’t aggressive normally. However, whenever they encountered Gu Ning, they were easily irritated.

Probably because Gu Ning was being too calm, which made them feel like they hadn’t been taken seriously.

Or probably because Gu Ning’s calmness showed her confidence, which made them feel nervous unconsciously. Therefore, they would fight against her confidence by arguing.

“Aren’t you confident?” Gu Ning asked them.

“You...” Hao Ran and his friends suddenly realized Gu Ning had outstanding ability to piss someone off.

Everyone around them started to discuss.

“Gu Ning isn’t scared at all! She’s even in the mood of joking.”

Gu Xiaoxiao, Shao Feifei and their friends all wanted Gu Ning to fail. Seeing Gu Ning being so confident, they were greatly displeased.

“I think she’s pretending!” Gu Xiaoxiao said.

“Exactly, she’s merely pretended to be relaxed.”

...

Shao Feifei wanted to mock at Gu Ning, but she restricted herself for Mu Ke was here.

However, Mu Ke never glanced at her from the very beginning to the end. Shao Feifei was disappointed. She wanted to talk to him, but Gu Ning and Yu Mixi were here as well.

“Since you’re already here, why not...” Gu Ning proposed.

“What?” Hao Ran and his friends asked with one accord.

“I don’t want to be punished for fighting inside the school, thus we’ll fight outside. Since we all haven’t had meal yet, why don’t we have the fight first, and the loser will buy the meal. Plus the precious condition stays the same,” Gu Ning said in a provocative way.

“Very well,” Hao Ran and his friends agreed.

“There’s a newly-demolished ruin at the opposite side of the back door of our school. There are few people around. Let’s go there!” Then, Gu Ning moved first, followed by Mu Ke and Yu Mixi. Hao Ran and his friends were behind.

The onlookers wouldn’t miss that. All of the 40 students in the fourth classroom were here, along with Gu Xiaoxiao and her friends and dozens of students from other classrooms.

A group of people moved outside attracted much attention.

It wasn’t usual to see such a large gathering of students in the school. Many people immediately knew there was going to be a fight.

Those cowards all stayed away, while those who wanted to see a drama followed up. Accordingly, a group of dozens of students became a group of hundreds. The security guards of the school also noticed that.

But unless someone got hurt, they wouldn’t do anything about it.

Gu Ning and others went straight to the ruin.

Everyone was excited when they arrived at the ruin, pulling out a phone, preparing to shoot.

Although Mu Ke and Yu Mixi chose to believe in Gu Ning, they felt anxious. They didn’t want her to be injured.

“Boss, fighting!”

“Gu Ning, fighting!”

When Mu Ke and Yu Mixi tried to encourage Gu Ning, their voices were trembling a little.

“Just trust me,” Gu Ning comforted them. Her determined voice calmed Mu Ke and Yu Mixi down a lot.

“Shall we stop when it’s necessary, or shall we fight to the end?” Before they started, Gu Ning asked.

“As long as someone fall on the ground, he or she loses.” Hao Ran didn’t want to go too far, given that Gu Ning was a girl.

Gu Ning had a great impression of Hao Ran’s behavior, but she also knew they still didn’t take her seriously enough.

If one didn’t take his opponent seriously, he would lose in any kind of fight.

“Great, then, let’s begin!”

Gu Ning announced the beginning, and both sides moved.

Gu Ning moved extremely fast. Before everyone could see it clearly, Gu Ning came straight to Zhang Tianping’s face. She threw Zhang Tianping over her shoulder without hesitation.

Zhang Tianping, who was a tall strong boy, was easily thrown over by Gu Ning’s shoulder to the ground. Everyone was in a shock.

Zhang Tianping himself was struck dumb too. He still had no idea what had happened when he was thrown to the floor.

Obviously, Gu Ning had seized her chance when Zhang Tianping didn’t take her seriously.

Those boys were real fighter actually. If they were fully-prepared, it would cost Gu Ning more time to deal with them.
