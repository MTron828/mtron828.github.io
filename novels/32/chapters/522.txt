Chapter 523 Strike Up a Conversation

The other saleswomen were also happy to see Gu Ning but they were all busy introducing the jewelry to their customers, so they didn’t greet Gu Ning right away.

When Gu Qing and Gu Man saw the price tags of the jewelry, both of them were astonished even though they knew it wasn’t cheap. “Jesus! They’re so expensive! This jade pendant alone costs over three hundred thousand yuan!” Gu Qing exclaimed.

“Indeed! I think only the rich can afford them,” Gu Man said.

“Three hundred thousand yuan? It’s one of the cheap ones, and there are many pieces of jewelry in this store that cost over a million yuan. If you can’t afford it, I don’t think that you should walk in here,” a nearby woman said with obvious disdain. Arrogant women just seemed to be everywhere!

Gu Qing and Gu Man felt embarrassed again. Although they felt uncomfortable, they knew that they had behaved like bumpkins, so they didn’t say anything. However, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting were displeased. “Well, since you’re rich, why don’t you buy it?” Gu Ning said on purpose.

“Of course I can afford it!” The woman actually was hesitating to buy the jade pendant, because it was very expensive but now she made up her mind to buy it in order to show off her wealth. “Pack this one please. I’ll pay the five hundred and eighty thousand yuan by card.”

The jade pendant was made of high-level violet type, so it was very expensive although it wasn’t big.

“No problem.” The saleswoman, of course, was excited to strike another deal today, and she admired her boss, Gu Ning very much too, because Gu Ning made the woman swipe her card just by saying a sentence.

Gu Qing and Gu Man, on the other hand, were surprised that the woman swiped her card without hesitation.

Anyway, this was Gu Ning’s jewelry store, and they all felt happy for Gu Ning, because she made a lot of money from the deal.

When the woman came back after she swiped her card at the counter she looked at Gu Ning and the others with arrogance and provocation. “Ha, what can you say now? Can you afford any piece of jewelry here?”

“We don’t need to,” Gu Ning said airily.

“Ha-ha, I think you simply can’t afford it.” The woman laughed at them.

The saleswoman who was standing by her side was amused by her stupidity. Gu Ning was the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry so all the jewelry belonged to her! However, the saleswoman had no intention to tell the woman the truth, because she understood that it was a trap set by her boss.

After that, Gu Ning lifted Gu Man’s hand, and showed the woman the Fulushou jade bracelet around Gu Man’s wrist. “Do you know what type this jade is?” Gu Ning asked the woman with pride.

“Fulushou!” The woman rounded her eyes in shock. Fulushou was very easy to recognize. Nevertheless, the woman didn’t believe that Gu Man could afford the Fulushou jade. “Is it real?”

Facing her suspicion, Gu Ning wasn’t mad but smiled. “Well, this jade bracelet is from Jade Beauty Jewelry. Can it be fake?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What?” The woman felt embarrassed now. It turned out that she wasn’t richer than them at all.

Luckily, the store was large, and customers weren’t close to each other, so not many people noticed what was happening among them. Otherwise, she would be despised by a lot of people, which wasn’t a pleasant experience.

Without another word, the woman soon slid out of the store in shame.

Gu Qing and Gu Man didn’t criticize Gu Ning’s behavior, because it was the woman’s fault after all. In addition, they also felt great seeing the woman losing face.

Leng Shaoting, of course, was supportive no matter what Gu Ning did. He even thought that Gu Ning had been too kind to the woman. Afterwards, they went on shopping in the store.

Not far from them, there were two beautiful young women choosing jade pendants in front of a display counter. When Gu Ning and the others walked by them, they noticed Leng Shaoting and were stunned by his outstanding appearance.

“Wow! The man is so handsome!”

“Indeed! Why don’t we strike up a conversation with him?”

“Is the girl who is walking at the front his girlfriend? Is it alright if we just go over and say hi?”

“No idea, but I don’t care.”

“Fine, let’s go!”

Although their voices weren’t loud, both Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were able to hear their talk and both of them were displeased.

Once the two women arrived at Leng Shaoting’s side, one of them opened her mouth. “Hi...”

“Leave me alone,” Leng Shaoting said coldly.

The two women were struck dumb for a second then flushed with embarrassment. To their surprise, the man didn’t care about their feelings at all.

Gu Ning and her family stopped then turned back, walking to Leng Shaoting.

People around them also noticed the drama, which made the two women feel more embarrassed. “How can you be so rude? We just said hi. Couldn’t you be nice?” A woman criticized.

“You just said hi? Do we know each other? And sorry, I heard your little talk just then,” Leng Shaoting said plainly then his sight shortly fell on Gu Man before he added, “I’m not a playboy.”

Hearing that, Gu Ning understood that he aimed to tell Gu Man that he was a good and reliable man.

“Ha-ha, I bet the two women didn’t expect that the handsome man would be so straightforward.”

“You’re right.”

People around them started to discuss them.

Although Gu Man and Gu Qing thought that Leng Shaoting had been a little rude, they believed that what he had done was right.

“Shut up!” The woman was mad. “Do you know who I am? I’m from the Fu family, which is ranked seventh on the rich list of City D! If any one of you dare to annoy me, you can’t bear the result!”

Hearing that, people around them all closed their mouths at once, because none of them dared to annoy the Fu family.
