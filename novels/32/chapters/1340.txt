Chapter 1341: Seek Justice for Them

It totally depended on Peng Xinghao’s skills whether he could get a job in Gu Ning’s garment company.

Gu Ning was kind, but wasn’t dumb after all.

“If your younger brother is a skilled designer, I won’t miss the chance to hire him, but I’m a businesswoman and I need to have an interview with him first,” Gu Ning said.

“Of course, I understand!” Peng Xiaoman was cheered up.

If Peng Xinghao could really become a clothing designer, she would be super happy for him. In fact, she had great confidence in Peng Xinghao. Moreover, she hoped that they could pay back the money in this way.

Gu Ning understood that Peng Xiaoman was very kind and grateful to her.

“Miss Peng, do you have your younger brother’s photos in your phone?” Gu Ning asked Peng Xiaoman later.

“Yes,” Peng Xiaoman said.

She didn’t know why Gu Ning asked her for Peng Xinghao’s photos, but she believed that Gu Ning wouldn’t hurt them. She sent Gu Ning a photo of her younger brother at once.

Gu Ning then called K without delay.

She didn’t walk away and talked with K on the phone right in front of Peng Xiaoman.

“I’ll send you a photo of a young man. Can you investigate XX company to see what happened to the young man at 12 pm,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Peng Xiaoman realized that Gu Ning was helping them to collect evidence.

Gu Ning was going to seek justice for them.

Thinking of that, Peng Xiaoman asked, “Miss Gu, are you...”

“Since you’re going to work for me, I should help you find out the truth,” Gu Ning said.

Peng Xiaoman almost cried at this moment. “M-Miss Gu, thank you, thank you so much!”

Xia Yichu’s treatment was also done, and there was no need for her to stay in the hospital.

When she left, Lu Xiao called Gu Ning and told her about Xia Yichu’s situation.

Gu Ning had made good arrangements for Peng Xinghao as well, so she didn’t need to stay here. Peng Xiaoman would take good care of Peng Xinghao. Nevertheless, before she left, she gave Peng Xiaoman two power crystals and told her to help Peng Xinghao take them once he was pushed out of the operation room.

The pill would melt once it was put into Peng Xinghao’s mouth, so he could take it even if he was still unconscious.

If she was available, she would come to see them, and if Peng Xinghao was in danger again, Peng Xiaoman could call her.

When Peng Xinghao woke up, they could talk about his job then.

Peng Xiaoman repeatedly thanked Gu Ning.

When Gu Ning walked out, Xia Yichu was already sitting in Lu Xiao’s car. Her agent and assistant were also with her.

The interlude Xia Yichu sang for a new TV show was released recently, and it ranked high on the list of the most popular music within three days. It was even more popular than the opening song and ending song.

As a result, Xia Yichu gained greater fame.

Before Xia Yichu made her debut, she had caused a sensation several times on the Internet, so she wasn’t a strange face in many people’s eyes.

Fenghua Entertainment had also become a famous entertainment company now, so all its artists shared its fame. In addition, Pei Hena’s fans became Xia Yichu’s fans later.

Xia Yichu was prettier than Pei Hena too, so she was more likely to be a popular singer.

The music video Xia Yichu was shooting was precisely for her new song, Lose.

This was Xia Yichu’s first song, and she also had three other songs waiting to be released. Xia Yidong wrote one of them, while a famous composer finished the other two.

The other three songs would be released when Lose brought greater fame to Xia Yichu.

Since Xia Yidong wrote songs for Xia Yichu, he also got paid by Fenghua Entertainment, but because Xia Yidong didn’t have much fame now, the pay wasn’t high.

Nevertheless, Xia Yidong didn’t care about it, because he was writing songs for his older sister.

However, although Xia Yichu had signed a contract with Fenghua Entertainment, Xia Yidong hadn’t yet.

With the help of Xia Yichu’s influence, Xia Yidong had many followers on Weibo as well. Xia Yidong used his own photo as the profile photo. Xia Yichu was very beautiful, and Xia Yidong was attractive too.

...

“Hi, boss.” When Gu Ning walked over, they all greeted her with respect.

Gu Ning nodded, and her sight fell on Xia Yichu. “How do you feel now?”

“It’s not painful now. Thank you, boss,” Xia Yichu said with a smile. If it hadn’t been for Gu Ning’s pill, she probably would have to stay in the patient bed for days.

“Great, Lu Xiao will drive you home, and you can start to work again after making a full recovery,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure,” Xia Yichu said.

After that, Lu Xiao drove Xia Yichu home, and Gu Ning went back to her company.

On the way, K called Gu Ning and told her that he already got the surveillance video.

Gu Ning said that she was still on her way to the company, and that she would watch it after she arrived.

She called K once she was in her office, and K went to see her with his computer.
