3207 The Company has been Smashed

She could do that on her own, but she was unfamiliar with the capital city. All in all, it was more convenient for Li Mochen to do it.

However, that wasn’t the main reason. No matter how inconvenient it was, she could handle it. She simply wanted to have more chances to see Li Mochen.

“No problem, I can do that.” Li Mochen agreed with alacrity. He didn’t think it would be difficult. In fact, as soon as she asked him for help, he already thought of a place.

Although the housing price was a little high in that place, he knew that Leng Xiaoyao made a lot of money from the stock market. It wasn’t a big deal for her to buy a house.

In addition, since Leng Xiaoyao turned to him for help, he would help her get the lowest price.

!!

Moreover, he didn’t doubt that Leng Xiaoyao had the ability to be accepted by the Capital University.

“Thank you, Brother Mochen,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“It’s my pleasure,” Li Mochen replied.

After eating, Li Mochen drove Leng Xiaoyao home. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Although they didn’t chat much in the car, the atmosphere was very harmonious.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to go home right away. Just as she tried to think of a reason to persuade Li Mochen to take her out for fun, her phone rang. The caller was Mu Yufan, so Leng Xiaoyao answered it at once.

“What happened?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“Boss, bad news, our company has been smashed,” Mu Yufan said urgently.

Leng Xiaoyao was immediately angry, and so was Li Mochen who was next to her.

“Do you know who did it?” Leng Xiaoyao asked in a serious tone.

“It was a bunch of gangsters, but we’ve never offended any gangs. I think they might have a relationship with Tianhe Technology. After all, only Tianhe Technology has any conflict against us. Fengyang has a new boss and hasn’t opened yet, so there shouldn’t be any grudges between us and other companies,” Mu Yufan said.

Leng Xiaoyao also had the same guess.

“I’ll come right now. We can talk about it later,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t carry her laptop today, so she couldn’t investigate it right now. She had to wait till she arrived at the company.

Afterwards, Leng Xiaoyao asked Li Mochen to send her to Xiaoyao Technology.

“Need help?” asked Li Mochen, even if he understood that Leng Xiaoyao could handle it.

“I’ll see after finding out exactly what’s happening,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t know any details yet, so she wasn’t sure whether she needed Li Mochen’s help.

Even if she didn’t have Li Mochen’s help, she could deal with all kinds of situations on her own, but she said that to keep Li Mochen by her side.

About a dozen minutes later, they arrived at Xiaoyao Technology. The gangsters were already gone.

At that time, only Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai were in the company, and there were eight gangsters. All of them were strong and skilled, so Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai were no match for them. They were both injured.

Everything in the building was a mess and all the computers were destroyed. After a glance, Leng Xiaoyao was furious.

“Boss, I’m sorry, we failed to protect the company.”

As soon as Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai saw Leng Xiaoyao, they apologized. No matter who those men were, they believed that it was their fault so they blamed themselves.

“It’s not your fault. Are there any good computers left?” asked Leng Xiaoyao. She didn’t blame Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai. Even if it happened because of them, it wasn’t their fault.

“My laptop is still fine,” Zhou Yunkai said. He immediately went to bring his laptop out.

Although both of them were injured, luckily it wasn’t serious.

Leng Xiaoyao took his laptop, turned it on, and immediately began to investigate.

Within half an hour, she found not only those gangsters, but the mastermind behind it too. The mastermind was indeed someone from Tianhe Technology and it turned out to be He Fangqi.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t think He Fangqi took revenge because she had discovered that he stole the public money and threatened him. She had confidence in her skills and believed that Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai would keep it a secret.

Therefore, He Fangqi must have smashed Xiaoyao Technology Company for another reason.

As for what that reason was, she needed to ask He Fangqi.

Those men who ran to smash her company were indeed a bunch of gangsters. They belonged to Ji Yanxi’s gang.

She didn’t think Ji Yanxi knew about it, but she needed to see him since those men belonged to his gang.

Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao immediately took out her phone to call him.

Before long, Ji Yanxi answered and joked. “Miss Leng, you rarely call me. What happened?”

“Mr. Ji, my company has been smashed. After investigating, I found that it was done by your people. One of them is called Zhang Zengxu. The mastermind is He Fangqi who works in Tianhe Technology. Mr. Ji, please help me catch them. I need to interrogate them,” Leng Xiaoyao said coldly. Although it had nothing to do with Ji Yanxi, she couldn’t be gentle right now.

Leng Xiaoyao found that they had a relationship with He Fangqi, but there was no evidence to prove that it was He Fangqi’s order. That being the case, she needed more evidence and had to make one side admit to the crime.

Hearing that, Ji Yanxi was also angry. He replied angrily. “Miss Leng, I’m sorry, I had no idea about that. I’ll catch them right away, then hand them over to you.”

“Great.” Leng Xiaoyao answered. After hanging up, she turned to Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai. “Let’s go. Let me send you to the hospital. You don’t need to care about what happened here. We can clean it up after Tianhe Technology pays the compensation.”

“Sure.” Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai agreed. Because they were injured, they didn’t insist on staying there.

Shortly after Leng Xiaoyao and the others left the company, Ji Yanxi called her.

“Miss Leng, I already ordered them to be brought to the casino. They should be there in twenty minutes. When do you want to come?” asked Ji Yanxi.

“I need to send two of my subordinates to the hospital right now. I should be there in about half an hour,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“No problem.” Ji Yanxi answered.

After the call, Ji Yanxi was still angry which scared his two close subordinates.

This time, Zhang Zengxu and his brothers would definitely receive a serious punishment. How dare they offend their manager’s friend?

The Qiao Organization was one of the top 100 large corporations in Country Han. It owned casinos, hotels, clubhouses and so on. Although it seemed to be a corporation on the surface, it was actually the most powerful gang in the south- the Qiao Gang.

Ji Yanxi was one of the managers of the six departments of Gang Qiao. He had an extremely high status in the gang and directly carried out orders from their leader.
