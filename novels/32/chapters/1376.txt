Chapter 1377: Are You Happy That She’s Injured?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This restaurant wasn’t built for business people, but looked like a siheyuan in an ancient and yet modern style, which was quite special. It was very popular, and almost half of it’s hall was occupied before 6 pm, and even though there were some vacant tables, they were probably reserved for other diners.

Actually, although this restaurant was very big and popular, it wasn’t crowded every day. However, the prices there were lower than in a five-star hotel, so it was affordable in many people’s eyes.

...

Gu Ning went straight to the private room once she arrived. Leng Shaoxun and Leng Shaoxi were still absent, so she sat down to wait for them.

When it was almost 6 pm, Leng Shaoxun and Leng Shaoxi still didn’t show up, but they gave Gu Ning a call.

“I’m sorry. We’re caught by a traffic jam on the road, so we’ll be a few minutes late,” Leng Shaoxun said.

“It’s fine. You don’t need to rush, and you must be careful,” Gu Ning said. She knew that the traffic jam was terrible in the capital, so she stayed calm.

Leng Shaoxun was aware that Gu Ning had a good temper, but he still needed to give her a call if he was going to be late. Although they regarded Gu Ning as a member of their family, it didn’t mean they could be impolite.

About a dozen minutes later, Leng Shaoxun and Leng Shaoxi arrived, and they ran to the private room without hesitation.

They apologized to Gu Ning again before they seated themselves to order.

Once the waiter left after they finished ordering, Leng Shaoxun said to Gu Ning with excitement, “Ningning, I must share a piece of good news with you. Leng Shaojia was beaten by someone!”

Saying that, Leng Shaoxun couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “Well, nobody knows who the attacker is, but we all know that it must be Leng Shaojia’s fault, because she’s always arrogant and aggressive. In addition, she isn’t seriously injured, so grandpa told them to stop investigating it.”

Gu Ning was surprised when Leng Shaoxun told her that the Leng family would give up investigating it. She used to be worried about it, so she kept it a secret from others.

Besides, they thought that Leng Shaojia wasn’t seriously injured because they didn’t know her waist was damaged by Gu Ning’s magical power.

Anyway, the Leng family was a reasonable family because it knew Leng Shaojia’s personality very well.

Gu Ning actually didn’t think that Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia would be willing to listen to Master Leng, because they were very mean. They probably agreed on the surface, but would still continue to investigate it behind Master Leng’s back.

Nevertheless, even if they wouldn’t give up, Gu Ning would be fine.

“Are you happy that she’s injured?” Gu Ning looked at Leng Shaoxun with a smile.

“Of course! I hate her because she’s always arrogant. She should have learned her lesson earlier on!” Leng Shaoxun said.

“My mother told us to visit her today, but she’s transferred to another hospital, so we decided to see you instead,” Leng Shaoxun added.

“Ningning, how’s your engagement with Shaoting now?” Leng Shaoxi asked with concern. She liked Gu Ning very much, and couldn’t wait to see her legally become a member of the Leng family. She admired Gu Ning, and hoped that Gu Ning could be with Leng Shaoting forever.

“When will you be engaged?” Leng Shaoxun asked with anticipation.

“I think we probably need to do that next year,” Gu Ning said.

In fact, she was a little disappointed when she heard the news, but she didn’t think it was a big deal. They were only going to be engaged, instead of getting married, and it wouldn’t change their life but only titles. Leng Shaoting, on the contrary, was unhappy about it for a long time.

“Next year?” Leng Shaoxun and Leng Shaoxi looked disappointed too. They thought that Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning would be engaged soon.

In the Leng family’s house, Leng Yuanjin, Master Leng’s youngest daughter, and her husband along with their daughter came.

Leng Yuanjin and her husband just heard about what had happened to Leng Shaojia, so they came back with their daughter. Because of the delay of their flight, they didn’t arrive until the night. They didn’t live in the capital, but a first-tier city which was a little far away, so it wasn’t easy for them to come back to the capital. Leng Yuanjin knew that Leng Shaojia wasn’t seriously injured, so she decided to go back to the Leng family’s house before she went to the hospital.

Once they showed up, the Leng family welcomed them and they went to dine together before they left to visit Leng Shaojia.

Because Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaoming stayed in the hospital to keep Leng Shaojia company, they were absent now.
