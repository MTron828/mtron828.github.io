Chapter 544 Old Memories

“Oh, where is Jiakai?” Gu Ning asked. She hadn’t seen Tang Jiakai ever since she had entered the Tang family’s house.

“He’s been in his school recently and he’s busy this weekend so he didn’t come back. We haven’t told him about what happened to Yunfan yet,” Tang Haifeng said.

In Tang Yunfan’s room, Gu Man sat by the bedside, holding his hand, talking to him.

“Ning, I know you lost your memory about us, so let me tell you now.”

His name wasn’t Tang Yunfan 18 years ago, so Gu Man called him Ning.

“Do you know why I named our daughter Gu Ning? It’s because your name was Ning.”

“Eighteen years, oh, no, 19 years ago to be specific, I met you. You had been injured all over your body. I took you to the hospital, but you told me that you had forgotten everything when you woke up and you wouldn’t let me go. To be honest, my heart skipped a beat when I saw you for the first time because you were so handsome and charming. However, you lost your memory when we met each other and I don’t know whether you were married or not, so I intentionally kept a distance from you. Well, I still fell in love with you in the end.”

“I remember everything that happened between us. Once when a man sexually insulted me in my workplace, you stood up for me and beat him down on the ground. You were injured too.”

“Once when...”

“Once when...”

Gu Man told many details of her old memories.

“You were very outstanding in work too and you became a supervisor after having worked in a company for only half a year, and you were gradually promoted to be the manager of the planning department. However, you were caught in a car accident, which was the beginning of our 18-years separation.”

“In the beginning, I wanted to kill myself, but I found out that I was already pregnant so I persuaded myself to live my life for the sake of our baby...”

When it was almost 7 pm, Gu Ning went upstairs to tell Gu Man to come have dinner with them. Gu Man had already spent two hours in Tang Yunfan’s room.

It wasn’t necessary to talk to Tang Yunfan for a whole day, and Gu Man could do it for around two hours in the morning and in the afternoon. It was tiring to talk for nearly four hours a day, and Gu Man needed rest as well.

When Gu Man walked out, she looked haggard with red swollen eyes.

“Ningning, I don’t think that I’m in a good condition to meet them,” Gu Man said.

“It’s fine. Don’t worry about it.” Gu Ning held Gu Man’s hands, and secretly put her power into Gu Man’s body to help Gu Man recover and cheer Gu Man up. However, Gu Ning didn’t help Gu Man recover completely back to normal. If Gu Man looked normal as usual after seeing Tang Yunfan in danger the others might think that she was cold blooded. Therefore, Gu Man still appeared with her slightly haggard face. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Nobody thought that she wasn’t beautiful anymore but had deep sympathy for her. All the members in the Tang family felt guilty, but they didn’t know what to say because they all hoped that Tang Yunfan would wake up as soon as possible.

During dinner, Tang Yunrong and Jiang Lihua kept putting all kinds of dishes into Gu Man’s bowl and told her to eat as much as she could. Gu Man actually had a poor appetite after crying and talking for two hours in Tang Yunfan’s room. Even so, she did her best to eat as much as she could in order to not worry Tang Yunrong and Jiang Lihua.

When Leng Shaoting arrived at City B, he sat in a restaurant waiting for Gu Ning.

Leng Shaoting’s outstanding appearance attracted a lot of attention from women around him, but many of them didn’t dare to strike up a conversation with him because he seemed very cold. However, one woman was an exception.

Because there was heating in the restaurant, many people took off their coats after they came in. And the woman who came to Leng Shaoting’s table was wearing a tight-fitting, low-cut red sweater with a hip hugging skirt that outlined her alluring figure. Accompanied by her delicate features and makeup look, she was able to win most men’s hearts. However, Leng Shaoting only loved Gu Ning, so he disliked any woman who struck up a conversation with him.

“Hey, may I sit here?” the woman asked in a sexy tone but it was quite disgusting in Leng Shaoting’s ears.

“No,” he said plainly, and the smile immediately froze on the woman’s face. It was the very first time that a man had rejected her in public! Even so, the woman didn’t want to give up because the man was so handsome. “Hey, don’t be so...”

“Leave me alone.” Before the woman could finish, Leng Shaoting opened his mouth again and gave her a cold glance. The woman was scared, and felt utterly embarrassed, so she left in a hurry.

Such things had happened many times.

When Gu Ning and Gu Man finished dinner, they went back to Huafu Hills; they would come again at 9 o’clock tomorrow morning.

Tang Yunhang drove them back to Huafu Hills in person, and Gu Ning could drive her car to the Tang family’s house tomorrow. The car entered Huafu Hills, and stopped in front of a beautiful house.

When Gu Man saw the house she was totally shocked. To her astonishment, the Tang family was so generous.

Gu Ning had told Gu Man that the Tang family had given her a house before they went to visit them, but Gu Man didn’t know that the house was so luxurious and was located in City B. The housing price was extremely high in City B, and this house had to be worth over dozens of millions of yuan.

After they got out of the car, Tang Yunhang took out two 20-inch suitcases from its trunk. Gu Ning’s clothes were in one of them, and Gu Man’s were in another.

“What are these?’ Gu Man was confused.

“Grandpa Tang told my two aunts to prepare some clothes for us, in case we didn’t bring a change of clothes with us from City G,” Gu Ning explained.

“Well...” Gu Man was surprised that the Tang family was so considerate. “Please pass on my thanks to Master Tang,” Gu Man said to Tang Yunhang.

Actually they could buy new clothes by themselves, but they accepted Master Tang’s kindness since he already did it for them.

“Of course,” Tang Yunhang said.

The Tang family treated Gu Man very well, not only because her relationship with Tang Yunfan, but also because she came to City B for the purpose of helping them wake Tang Yunfan up.
