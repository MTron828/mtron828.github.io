913 Ji Manlin Argues with Gu Ning

Gu Ning was also unwilling to cause trouble for innocent people.

“No problem,” she said, then looked to Wan Baojie. “Are you sure that you are not going to let it go?”

Hearing that, Wan Baojie was annoyed again. “You just hurt us, so it’s impossible that I’ll let it go!”

“You just humiliated us in public. Do you think that’s acceptable?” Gu Ning asked him.

Wan Baojie was struck dumb. He felt that he had done nothing wrong, but somehow felt a little guilty when Gu Ning questioned him. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Baojie, do you need me to make the call or not?” Wan Baojie’s friend asked him again.

Wan Baojie didn’t know what to do now.

“Even though you want to call others for help, you must have the ability to keep us here first,” Gu Ning said.

Wan Baojie thought that it was reasonable.

“Fine, forget it,” Wan Baojie said in the end.

“What should we do now?” his friend asked.

“Well...” Wan Baojie was confused. He was reluctant to let them leave, but he couldn’t keep them here either.

All of a sudden, Gu Ning thought that Wan Baojie was very funny, and he did not really seem to be a bad young man. In addition, they were already kicked away and hurt.

“You humiliated us first, and we hurt you afterwards. Why don’t we let it go? You’re not badly injured after all,” Gu Ning said.

They were just kicked away and were only slightly hurt, therefore they had the energy to argue with Gu Ning right now. Moreover, they were all young men, and would recover soon.

Wan Baojie nodded and gave in. “Fine, you can leave.”

Hearing that, the onlookers were surprised because they thought that there was going to be a fierce fight.

Wan Baojie was the head of his friend circle, so his friends all listened to him. After that, they left for the hospital, and Gu Ning went back to continue to eat.

Once Wan Baojie and his friends were gone, the three tourists walked over to thank Gu Ning. “Miss, thank you so much for your help.”

“You’re so good at fighting!”

“If we fought against them, we probably couldn’t win.”

...

After having night snacks, Gu Ning and her friends went back to the hotel.

Unfortunately, there was another problem in their way.

A woman suddenly ran to stop Gu Ning just as they entered the hall. It was Ji Manlin who was Ye Jiasheng’s admirer.

Leng Shaoting frowned and wanted to chase her away, but Gu Ning stopped him. She was curious what Ji Manlin was going to do. It must be something to do with Ye Jiasheng.

“Tell me, what’s your relationship with Jiasheng?” Ji Manlin questioned Gu Ning without delay.

Gu Ning didn’t want to cause any misunderstandings, so she explained with patience. “We’re merely acquaintances.”

“You’re lying! If you’re not close to him, why did he pick you up and send you back with his car?” Ji Manlin didn’t believe Gu Ning’s words. She couldn’t find Gu Ning’s identity, so she arranged someone to wait at the door.

The person told her that Ye Jiasheng sent Gu Ning and her friends back in person, and that they left to have night snacks after a while.

Ji Manlin then came over at once. She had waited for a whole hour and Gu Ning was finally back.

“Well.” Gu Ning was amused. “Miss Ji, you want to hear my answer, but refuse to believe it. What’s the point of asking me that question then?”

“Tell me, why did he pick you up and send you back in person?” Ji Manlin questioned Gu Ning again.

As long as Ye Jiasheng walked close to another woman, she would do everything she could to find out every detail.

Gu Ning realized that Ji Manlin was unreasonable, so she stopped explaining. “It’s none of your business.”

“I am his future wife, so it is my business!” Ji Manlin said with pride.

“Seriously?” Gu Ning sneered. “Miss Ji, didn’t Ye Jiasheng say that he has no interest in you, right here earlier today? Don’t you think that it’s too shameful that you take yourself as his future wife? Please stay away from me, or I’ll punch you away.”

“You...” Ji Manlin was mad. “How dare you say that to my face? You can’t bear the result if you annoy me!”

Gu Ning rolled her eyes. Why did these people love threatening others with their family backgrounds?

Leng Shaoting frowned when Ji Manlin threatened Gu Ning.

“Miss Ji, I don’t want to waste time arguing with you in a public place. This is my boyfriend. Think about it. Don’t you think my man is much better looking than Ye Jiasheng?” Gu Ning held Leng Shaoting’s arm.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was cheered up. His girl was complimenting him.
