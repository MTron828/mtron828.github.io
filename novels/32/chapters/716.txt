Chapter 717 Gu Ning’s Arrangement

Tang Deming, on the other hand, couldn’t believe his eyes.

What’s going on here? Shouldn’t it be a video of an employee of Tanghuang Group making a deal with a person working in Technology Company E? Why has it been replaced?

Quan Mingkai was also surprised to see the land in the video, but he was familiar with it.

Allan noticed their confusion, and said, “This is a great piece of land, and many real estate companies of Country Y are competing for it. Luckily, I succeeded in acquiring it in the end. I plan to build an exclusive private clubhouse and a resort on it, but my company can’t afford the expenses. I admire Tanghuang’s ability, so I hope that we can work together to develop the land, and share the profits fifty-fifty. What do you think?”

“What?” Everyone was shocked again.

They hadn’t dealt with the problem of the leak of the proposal yet, and Allan wanted to cooperate with Tanghuang again right now?

“Mr. Allan, shouldn’t we deal with the leak problem first?” Tang Deming asked in annoyance. They had made a deal beforehand. Why did Allan suddenly change his mind? He wasn’t afraid of the investigation because he wasn’t involved in it in person, but he was mad at the opposite result.

“It’s not me who isn’t willing to deal with the leak problem, but neither of us can find evidence. What can we do now? No matter who leaked the proposal, the company should pay compensation. Tanghuang can afford it, but I can’t, so I need to make money first,” Allan said.

After a second, he added, “Although the leak problem has affected our relationship, I don’t think that we can’t cooperate again. I appreciate Tanghuang’s influence and ability, so there is no reason for me to stop cooperating with Tanghuang. In addition, there is nothing that should be kept a secret in this deal, and it’s a win-win, so why don’t we have a try?”

Tang Deming was struck dumb with anger. It was obvious that Allan changed his mind, and it was useless for him to say anything further. Therefore, Tang Deming had to close his mouth, although he was reluctant to accept it.

“I agree! Although it wasn’t a pleasant cooperation in regards to the security system, we can still work with each other to make money!” Quan Mingkai said happily.

Given Allan’s previous attitude, Quan Mingkai believed that Allan must have made a secret deal with Tang Deming’s group. Even though Quan Mingkai was also confused by his sudden change, there was no reason for Quan Mingkai to decline this project which Allan sent them in person.

“Alright, we can keep on investigating the leak problem, and I hope that we can communicate with each other more. As long as we trust each other as usual, we can continue to work together. Well, I think it’s time for dinner, and I prefer to discuss business by a dining table. Would you mind inviting us to share a meal together?” Allan asked, and didn’t feel that there was anything wrong with it.

Tanghuang Group agreed to cooperate with them, but they still needed to discuss many details before signing the contract.

“Of course not!” Quan Mingkai said. Even if Allan didn’t say it himself, Quan Mingkai would invite him to dine together as well. “Would you mind sharing dinner with us at 5:30 pm at the hotel where you stay?”

Allan stayed in the Huangdeng Hotel which was owned by Tanghuang Group, and Quan Mingkai had booked rooms for them.

“Sure, why not,” Allan said.

After that, the meeting was over, and Quan Mingkai walked Allan’s group out.

They used to think that it would be a major difficulty, but to their astonishment it was easily solved!

When Tang Deming was back in his office, he called Tang Weiyong without delay. “The plan failed.”

“What? Failed?” Tang Weiyong was shocked. “What happened?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Tang Deming then told Tang Weiyong everything, which annoyed Tang Weiyong. “How could he change his mind and even propose to work with Tanghuang on such a big project?”

“What should we do next?” Tang Deming asked.

“I’ll call you when I have an idea,” Tang Weiyong said.

“Sure,” Tang Deming said.

Quan Mingkai didn’t walk back to the company until Allan’s group got in their cars.

Allan also made a call once he was seated in the car.

“Miss Gu, it’s already done, and I’ll meet you at the dinner,” Allan said in his gentle voice the second someone answered his call.

“Thanks!” Gu Ning said.

The person who answered Allan’s call was exactly Gu Ning.

At noon, K failed to find anything useful after hacking into Technology Company E’s and Technology Company G’s databases, so Gu Ning told him to find out who the boss of Technology Company G was.

Gu Ning planned to find a clue from its boss, but she was surprised to discover that the boss of Technology Company G was Allan.

Therefore, Gu Ning called Bai Xueyan for Allan’s number, then called Allan at once.

Gu Ning and Allan weren’t very familiar actually, but they had met each other a few times, so she thought that Allan might be willing to help her.

“Allan, hi. This is Gu Ning,” Gu Ning said when Allan answered her call.

“Miss Gu, I’m surprised to receive your call.” Allan was telling the truth, because they didn’t stay in touch although they had met before.

“Allan, please accept my apology first, because I’ve done an investigation of your company without your permission. I asked Xueyan for your number after I found out that you’re the boss of Technology Company G,” Gu Ning said.

“The thing is, I have a close relationship with Tanghuang Group and I have already heard the terrible news about the leak problem. Although I don’t know which company has leaked the information, but I think that it’s very likely to be a scheme against Tanghuang Group.”
