Hearing that, An Qian’s face turned pale. She trembled in fear. “Chen Mengqi, that’s illegal!”

“So what? Do you have any proof that shows that we did it?” Chen Mengqi asked snidely. She didn’t seem afraid at all.

“You...”

“An Qian, don’t blame me for this. If you want to blame someone, it’s Le Zhengyu’s fault. Although I always disliked you, I never thought of hurting you. If Le Zhengyu hadn’t...” Thinking of what had happened that day, Chen Mengqi’s face was distorted in anger. She had schemed behind Le Zhengyu’s back in the first place, but she couldn’t accept the result.

An Qian was also mad. “Chen Mengqi, you know that you deserve it!”

Although An Qian and Le Zhengyu weren’t a couple yet, they were as close as family. If someone hurt Le Zhengyu, she would feel annoyed too.

If it hadn’t been for Gu Ning, Le Zhengyu would have been trapped by Chen Mengqi. Chen Mengqi had just suffered from what she had done.

With a loud sound, Chen Mengqi slapped An Qian’s face. “It’s you! It’s all because of you! If it weren’t for you, Le Zhengyu would have been willing to accept me!”

Chen Mengqi almost went crazy because of the fact that Le Zhengyu loved An Qian and ignored her.

Actually, if it hadn’t been for An Qian, Le Zhengyu wouldn’t have come back to City F and Chen Mengqi wouldn’t have had a chance to meet him.

Chen Mengqi took out a camera aiming it at An Qian. “I’m going to send him the video of you being f*cked by them, and I’m curious whether he will still love you after that.”

Chen Mengqi went amok now.

“Chen Mengqi, you can’t do that. You can’t!” An Qian shouted in anger and desperation.

“I can’t? Well, it’s not up to you right now.” Chen Mengqi smiled with disdain. “You can begin now.”

Then, the four men walked towards An Qian.

“No-no...” An Qian was extremely terrified. She struggled to stand up, but fell down halfway.

She had been drugged, so she was out of strength now and even if she hadn’t been drugged, she wasn’t able to fight against four bulky men.

A man pounced on An Qian, dragging her to the ground, and was about to kiss her.

Right at this time, a gunshot sounded all of a sudden. They were all scared, and the camera in Chen Mengqi’s hand fell down onto the floor. Those men who were ready to rape An Qian all stood up by instinct.

“What the f*ck! Did someone discover us?” a man asked in horror.

They were just hoodlums, and were afraid of being caught. They thought that it had to be the police who had the gun.

“Let’s hide first!” Chen Mengqi was disappointed, but she also didn’t want to be caught. If she was caught, she would have no chance to get revenge on An Qian.

There was more than one gate of this warehouse. Thus they immediately ran to the back door. The warehouse was very large, and it took time for them to hide. During that time, Gu Ning got in and caught them before they were able to escape.

When Gu Ning arrived outside of this warehouse, she used her Jade Eyes, and noticed that An Qian was already in danger. Thus she pulled out and fired the gun to stop them before she got in.

Once Gu Ning dashed into the warehouse, Chen Mengqi and the other men who were about to open the back door, unconsciously looked back, and were all astonished to see Gu Ning instead of policemen.

Gu Ning didn’t waste any time, and ran to them punching them down within seconds.

Gu Ning was in a rage now, so she hit them heavily and without sympathy. One man’s legs were both broken; one’s arms were dislocated; one’s rib was broken in half, and the last one’s head was badly injured and he passed out right away. However, all of them were still alive. Gu Ning wouldn’t cause herself trouble.

As for Chen Mengqi, Gu Ning slapped her continuously before she seized her neck tightly. Chen Mengqi’s face turned pale, and she was immediately out of breath, and felt like she was dying.

Gu Ning had no intention to kill her, but decided to scare her to death.

An Qian, on the other hand, didn’t know what was on Gu Ning’s mind. She was worried that Gu Ning would be in trouble if Chen Mengqi died, so she interrupted Gu Ning. “Ningning, let her go. If she’s dead, you’ll end up in jail.”

“Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing,” Gu Ning answered.

An Qian believed Gu Ning and was relieved.

Gu Ning then threw Chen Mengqi to the ground with great force. Chen Mengqi was in agony, but couldn’t utter a word.

Gu Ning looked down at her and said coldly, “Chen Mengqi, you’ll pay for what you’ve done.”

After that, Gu Ning ignored her and turned back, walking to An Qian. “An Qian, are you alright?”

“I’m fine. Thank you so much for arriving on time, otherwise...” Although An Qian was safe now, she was still very afraid.

Then An Qian asked puzzled, “Oh, was there a gunshot? How did you know that I was here?”

“It wasn’t a gunshot. A lighter just exploded. I heard from several passers-by that you were caught by several hoodlums, so I came to help you,” Gu Ning lied.

An Qian didn’t doubt it, but only felt lucky. If Gu Ning hadn’t arrived on time, she would have been ruined already.

“What do you want to do with them?” Gu Ning asked. An Qian was the victim, so it was better to let her make the decision.

An Qian thought for a second, then said, “Let’s call the police!”.
