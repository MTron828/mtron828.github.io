2926 Did They Go to Assassinate Mr. He?

Because it wasn’t uncommon that people framed each other in politics, they couldn’t prove it without evidence.

Therefore, after sharing the result with Tang Yunhang, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting immediately went to conduct an investigation by visiting Wei Qihua’s home to see what they could find.

After waiting outside Wei Qihua’s home for an hour, they finally heard him make a call.

It turned out that it indeed had something to do with him.

!!

When Wei Qihua heard what had happened to Mr. He, he was full of anger and worry. He wondered whether Mr. He had betrayed him.

Because Mr. He couldn’t speak now, Wei Qihua failed to fet an answer.

Therefore, during their conversation on the phone, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting heard Wei Qihua give an order to kill Mr. He. After all, only dead people could keep secrets.

Wei Qihua wanted Mr. He dead, so Gu Ning had to keep him alive. Before Wei Qihua’s people could kill Mr. He, Gu Ning went to the hospital where Mr. He stayed, while Leng Shaoting stayed to watch Wei Qihua.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t know which hospital Mr. He stayed in until Wei Qihua mentioned it on the phone. Without delay, Gu Ning went there.

Mr. He was staying in a VIP ward. Given his wealth, he could afford it.

Although Mr. He didn’t have any relatives, he had some loyal subordinates, who didn’t leave after he was seriously injured.

Besides, before the final result was out, they couldn’t leave because most people in the manor were under suspicion. The surveillance cameras were broken, so they had no evidence to prove that they were innocent.

When Gu Ning arrived at the hospital, she was in a nurse uniform, making it convenient for her to take action.

Because some people were guarding Mr. He in his ward, Gu Ning didn’t go in right away. Instead, she used her Jade Eyes to see whether there were vacant wards around. She would hide first.

Luckily, the ward next to Mr. He’s ward was vacant, so Gu Ning sneaked inside.

About half an hour later, something happened to Mr. He.

A man who looked like a doctor walked into his ward and said that he was there to check on him, so Mr. He’s two subordinates let him in.

After that, the doctor wanted to give Mr. He an injection, and Mr. He’s two subordinates didn’t doubt or stop him.

At that moment, Gu Ning went inside.

Mr. He’s two subordinates thought that the nurse came with the doctor, so they said nothing, but the doctor panicked the moment he saw Gu Ning. He wasn’t a real doctor, so he felt guilty.

“Hey, who are you? Did you get the wrong ward? Doctor Yao told me to check on the patient. He didn’t tell other doctors to come here,” Gu Ning exclaimed in surprise.

Doctor Yao was Mr. He’s attending physician.

Gu Ning knew who Mr. He’s attending physician was because she saw the listing by the patient bed while she observed the ward.

Upon hearing that, Mr. He’s two subordinates were angry. If this doctor wasn’t sent here by Doctor Yao, why did he come?

Did he really get the wrong ward? They somehow felt that that reason wasn’t persuasive.

“Oh, you’re right. I must have gotten the wrong ward.” The man realized that he was exposed, so he used the same excuse and admitted that he got the wrong ward. Then he wanted to leave, but Gu Ning stopped him.

“This is a hospital. How can you go into the wrong ward so casually? If I hadn’t come and stopped you, you would have injected the medicine into his body. What if his condition got worse?” Gu Ning asked.

Mr. He’s two subordinates figured out that this male doctor might have come to murder Mr. He, so they went to catch him at once, but unfortunately the man was very good at martial arts, so he easily got rid of Mr. He’s two subordinates and wanted to run away.

His reaction proved that he had indeed come to harm Mr. He, otherwise he wouldn’t try to escape.

The next moment, Gu Ning took action and the man was beaten.

Besides, Gu Ning broke his leg with a heavy kick in case he tried to run away again.

Seeing that, Mr. He’s two subordinates were shocked. They didn’t expect a nurse to be so strong.

“Alright, I’ll leave him to you two,” Gu Ning said as she walked out.

“Hey!” Mr. He’s two subordinates wanted to stop her, but Gu Ning walked too fast. They couldn’t leave right now, so they had to give up.

Gu Ning didn’t care how they would handle it.

After the incident, Mr. He should be more careful to stop it from happening once more.

Wei Qihua should also be more cautious before carrying out his scheme.

If he really wanted to kill Mr. He, he would have to be fully-prepared next time. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

When Gu Ning was gone, Mr. He’s two subordinates called the police.

Before long, Wei Qihua learned about the result and got angry. He could only hope that the man wouldn’t betray him.

The next day, Wei Qihua heard that the man didn’t betray him. The man only said that he had a grudge against Mr. He, so he wanted to harm him since he was already seriously injured and in the hospital.

However, he denied that he aimed to kill Mr. He. He simply didn’t want Mr. He to wake up quickly.

Anyway, he was sentenced to a few years in jail, but the punishment wasn’t serious. Wei Qihua was safe for the time being.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting told Tang Yunhang that they verified that the mastermind was indeed Wei Qihua, but they couldn’t do anything to him right away. After all, the evidence wasn’t enough.

It couldn’t be easier for them to secretly pay Wei Qihua back, but they were unwilling to do so.

However, they were reluctant to accept the result, so they still decided to cause Wei Qihua a little trouble.

Therefore, at night, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to Wei Qihua’s home again. Gu Ning released some cold magical power to damage Wei Qihua’s health.

It wasn’t serious, but he would have to suffer from it in the following months.

As a result, Wei Qihua suddenly found his limbs had become stiff when he woke up the next day. As soon as he moved his entire body hurt. It was also difficult for him to speak.

Without delay, he asked his family to send him to the hospital.
