Chapter 1971: You Can Make the Decision

Facing Dongfang Qi’s words of threat, Gu Ning wasn’t mad at all. She had no intention of turning him down right away either.

Although she was able to get the spy out, Dongfang Qi knew more than just that. Therefore, for the sake of security, she needed to know more from him. In addition, she needed to see what Dongfang Qi wanted to decide whether to make a deal with him.

If she was able to satisfy the condition he set, she could agree to make a deal with him.

“So, what’s your conditions?” asked Gu Ning. She didn’t rush to find out, because she wouldn’t let him take control of their agreement.

Hearing that, Dongfang Qi felt slightly relieved, because it meant Gu Ning was interested in his proposal.

“Medicines produced by Colaine have great effects. I know there is a secret ingredient in the formula. The condition is that I need to get the ingredient,” said Dongfang Qi.

Without surprise, he came for the ingredient.

“If I give it to you, you can build a new medicine company and steal my business,” said Gu Ning. She actually wasn’t afraid of it, because no one else owned the ingredient.

“I promise I’ll never use it to make money,” said Dongfang Qi seriously.

“You can say that right now, but I’m afraid you’ll change your mind. Even biological brothers will compete against each other for money. We’re just acquaintances,” said Gu Ning.

It was indeed difficult for Dongfang Qi, because his promise was meaningless if Gu Ning refused to trust him.

“Alright, even if I give it to you, you can’t get it from other sources.” Gu Ning stopped acting in front of Dongfang Qi. She could accept the condition he set. Anyway, even if she gave it to him, they couldn’t make it by themselves.

Knowing that, Dongfang Qi didn’t know whether he should be happy or not. Although Gu Ning was willing to give the ingredient to him, he couldn’t get more of it. If there was only a little of it, it wouldn’t be helpful for his cultivation. Anyway, it was better than nothing! Moreover, he only needed to know what it was and would give up if he couldn’t find more.

Gu Ning then took over her backpack and opened it. From the telepathic eye space, she took out a porcelain bottle with a power crystal inside, then opened the bottle.

In an instant, Dongfang Qi smelt the pure magical power and felt really surprised. “What is this?”

The next second, Gu Ning shut the bottle. “It’s the secret ingredient. Although there is only one pill in this bottle, it’s unbelievably effective. It’s useful for nearly all kinds of pains and injuries. It can directly heal minor injuries and diseases or half of the serious ones. It can also rescue one’s life even if he’s dying giving you a better chance to survive. As for cancers, it’s helpful for early and middle stages, but might not be very helpful for advanced cancers.”

It was very helpful for mortals, but its effect would be reduced for cultivators. It was only useful if they were lightly injured. After all, there was only one pill, it would take more pills for them to enjoy its effect.

Dongfang Qi understood it was only really useful for mortals, but its unbelievable effect still shocked him.

Except for pills in the cultivation world, he didn’t know any medicines which could be so effective in this world! However, how did Gu Ning get the magical power since she was merely a mortal?

“I know you’re curious to know how I got this medicine, but it’s meaningless even if I tell you, because I don’t know either. It was given to me by an old man. He hoped I could use it to make medicines to help people. I don’t know his name. He simply sends some of it to me regularly, so I don’t have many,” said Gu Ning.

Dongfang Qi believed the old man must be a master from the cultivation world and he must be very skilled in medicines.

In fact, Dongfang Qi didn’t fully believe Gu Ning’s words, but he thought it must have been given to her by someone else, or she wouldn’t get it as a mortal.

“Now, you can make the decision. Are we going to make a deal?” said Gu Ning.

“Of course,” said Dongfang Qi. Even if he couldn’t get more of the medicine, a pill was enough. “There are actually two spies in your factory. One is Zhang Yong, while the other is called Huang Ziwei. Zhang Yong doesn’t have anything special. He’s simply a common guy, but Huang Ziwei is different. He’s quite good at martial arts. In your company, there is another spy named Lu Dan. He’s also excellent at martial arts. He’s from the same force as Huang Ziwei. All of them were accepted about a month ago. Zhang Yong is from the Chengfeng Group. Huang Ziwei and Lu Dan are from the Yaping Group. That’s all I know.”

Hearing that, Gu Ning began to analyze. Zhang Yong was a common guy, which meant he could only be a mortal. While Huang Ziwei and Lu Dan were good at martial arts, so they could be cultivators.

As for the Chengfeng Group and the Yaping Group, they must be companies established in the mortals’ world by powerful families from the cultivation world.

Because Gu Ning was a mortal, Dongfang Qi couldn’t tell her details about the powerful families. He wasn’t allowed to leak any information about the cultivation world. Even if he told Gu Ning, Gu Ning couldn’t understand it because nobody knew those powerful families in the mortals’ world.

Besides, Dongfang Qi shared the news with her because the Dongfang family wasn’t involved, or because he didn’t know that the Dongfang family also sent people to secretly collect information in Colaine.

It was more likely that Dongfang Qi meant to use Gu Ning to get rid of the people sent by other powerful families so that the man sent by the Dongfang family could gain all the advantages.

Unfortunately, Gu Ning was wrong. The Yaping Group was owned by the Dongfang family, but the man was sent by the eldest son of the Dongfang family, while Dongfang Qi’s father was the second son of the Dongfang family.

In the Dongfang family, the eldest son’s family never got along with the second son’s family, so Dongfang Qi was unwilling to see the man sent by his uncle succeed. It was the reason why he came to tell Gu Ning about it. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Chengfeng Group belonged to the Jing family. The Jing family also noticed that there was magical power in the medicines produced by Chengfeng Group, but didn’t think other families were aware of it too, so it only sent a mortal in order to prevent other families from discovering it.

Only the Yin family was unaware of the magical power in the medicines produced by Colaine, because it seldom came to the mortals’ world. However, it would soon learn about it, because they secretly paid attention to the other 3 families even though they rarely came to the mortal world.

Till now, only Baili Zongyang and Baili Zongxue had a good relationship with Gu Ning.
