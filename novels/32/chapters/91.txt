Chapter 93: Deceived By Leng Shaoting

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Junior high school was not as strict as high school and Jiang Xinyue was good at studying, so it was easy to apply.

In high school, especially in the third year of high school, it was necessary to take the National College Entrance Exam. Therefore, if you weren’t one of the top ten in the entire grade, it was impossible to not attend the evening class. Special situations excluded of course.

However, Gu Ning decided not to attend the evening class either after she got good scores at the monthly test.

Although she seemed free now, she felt she lacked time, and she couldn’t do anything she wanted to.

Besides, once her company was established, she wouldn’t have time for classes.

Now it wouldn’t be difficult for her to get good academic results even if she didn’t go to the afternoon classes.

In the past, whenever Gu Ning was home, she felt lonely, but now, she had her beloved families around. She felt happy every day.

The two families always gathered together chatting and watching TV. They didn’t separate until 12 am.

Gu Ning checked her phone and spoke to her friends for a while before she went to bed.

The next day, Gu Ning got up early as usual, but the minute she left zone G, she bumped into Leng Shaoting who was waiting for her outside.

Gu Ning felt upset all of a sudden.

The man was literally everywhere!

Gu Ning knew that she did something wrong, so she wasn’t in mood to blame the man, no matter whether he had followed her or if it was a coincidence.

Even she hated being stalked.

Leng Shaoting didn’t care about what was on Gu Ning’s mind. He walked towards her when she appeared in his sight.

“You better give the gun back to me; you’re just causing yourself trouble.” Leng Shaoting remained cool, but he didn’t threaten Gu Ning the way he normally would. It seemed he didn’t want to burden her.

“Why can’t you believe me?” Gu Ning struggled.

Leng Shaoting didn’t say another word, but he seemed determined.

Gu Ning knew the man would never let her get away with it. If she didn’t give the gun back to him, he would never leave her alone. If Gu Man found out about what had happened when she had been in City G, things would get out of control.

Gu Ning almost compromised, but she gave it one last shot. “Well, it’s not a big deal even if the gun is missing, right? Military officers never lack guns, right?”

“If you’re not one of the military or police personnel, it’s illegal to have a gun privately,” Leng Shaoting said.

“How about those gangsters with guns? Why don’t you deal with them?” Gu Ning retorted.

“It’s not the same case,” Leng Shaoting said.

“You must first have proof! Once you have proof, you can catch me,” Gu Ning said.

“I have the surveillance video as the proof,” Leng Shaoting answered.

Gu Ning was speechless. She couldn’t argue back this time.

Out of shame, Gu Ning didn’t doubt Leng Shaoting’s words at all. Besides, he wasn’t likely to lie as a military officer.

Fine, she did make a mistake. Gu Ning planned to buy one from the black market later.

Gu Ning took out her phone handing it to Leng Shaoting. “The gun isn’t with me right now. Give me your number and I’ll bring it to you when I’m free.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The gun had been put into the telepathic eye space, so it wasn’t appropriate to pull it out now.

Leng Shaoting stopped for a second. He stared at Gu Ning’s phone, but didn’t take it immediately. It seemed he felt awkward to touch a female’s stuff, but he didn’t feel reluctant in his heart. After a while, he took Gu Ning’s phone and typed in his name and number. He used Gu Ning’s phone to call his, and then hung up when his phone rang. He then gave it back to Gu Ning.

Gu Ning took her phone back. She took a glance then mumbled, “Leng Shaoting, you’re really like your name. A cold man.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting frowned a little. Although many people had said he was a cold man, he wasn’t willing to hear it from Gu Ning.

“Alright, I’m going to school now. Please don’t stop me on the road again. I’ll give the gun back to you later today or tomorrow.” Gu Ning ignored Leng Shaoting, and left.

Gu Ning had no idea that Leng Shaoting had deceived her. There was no surveillance video at all.

Watching Gu Ning leaving, Leng Shaoting had mixed emotions. Even though the girl had done something that he always hated, he found it was hard to hate her.

When Gu Ning was far away, Leng Shaoting’s face changed suddenly. He lowered his voice. “Get out here now!”

In the dark, Xu Jinchen stiffened. Shit!

He wanted to run away, but didn’t dare to.

Xu Jinchen had to show up at the end.

“Boss, I...” Xu Jinchen tried explaining, although he knew Leng Shaoting wouldn’t believe him.

Leng Shaoting didn’t give him a chance to explain at all. He said directly, “20 kilometers.”

Xu Jinchen’s face immediately turned pale.

Although he knew that he would be punished, he felt hurt when the punishment came.

Twenty kilometers was nothing to a senior soldier from the special force, but he was in a pair of slippers! He was wearing slippers now!

This was all because he was curious when he had heard Leng Shaoting go out early this morning.

However, Xu Jinchen soon cheered up, because he had just seen a shocking scene.

His boss had gone out early this morning to meet a woman, no, a girl! He even recognized that the girl was the female student he had sent to the hospital last week.

It was beyond his imagination, his boss finally changed.

However, the girl was merely 18, and was still a high school student. Was it appropriate if they were together?

Anyway, as long as his boss liked her, it was no big deal.

Grandpa Leng had already said, as long as Leng Shaoting was willing to get married, he didn’t care about the girl’s background at all.

However, Xu Jinchen had thought too far. There was nothing between Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning.

Gu Ning couldn’t arrive at her school on time, because she had wasted some time on the way. She told her friends in the Wechat group to run as usual. Anyone who was lazy and didn’t finish the task would be punished, and whoever reported it would be rewarded.
