Chapter 1821: Tanned

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Nothing happened again in the evening. Right after Leng Shaoting and the others arrived at the airport, he sent Gu Ning a message before getting aboard.

Because Gu Ning dined with Leng Shaoting and the others yesterday, Baili Zongxue bought her a meal the next afternoon.

Baili Zongxue also planned to buy a great meal for Gu Ning and Song Miaoge, so they didn’t have a nap that afternoon and instead went outside to have lunch.

After lunch, they slowly came back and went to have a walk on the campus. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

At this time, a boy walked towards them. He was Zhou Jiahao, who had an attack of epilepsy that day when Gu Ning had saved his life.

Zhou Jiahao had taken Gu Ning’s power crystal, so he was already fine back then, but he still went to the hospital for a check, in order to stop worrying. After the check, he was sure that his body was fine, so he came back to school after resting for two days.

People who had epilepsy should avoid strenuous exercise, but should have some exercise once in a while. Therefore, the instructor gave him priority. He didn’t need to take part in activities like standing at attention and running, but needed to practice other gentle activities.

Actually, even if Zhou Jiahao asked to quit the training, the school would agree, but he didn’t think it was necessary. He wasn’t that weak after all.

Moreover, as the assistant class leader, he should do his job well even though it was temporary.

This was Zhou Jiahao’s thoughts, which Gu Ning wasn’t aware of.

After Zhou Jiahao took Gu Ning’s power crystal, he was not likely to have another attack of epilepsy, although it couldn’t be completely cured.

“Um, Gu Ning, thank you for saving my life that day. If it hadn’t been for you, I could have lost my life.” Zhou Jiahao thanked Gu Ning. Facing Gu Ning, he was a little nervous, as if he was talking to an important figure like a dean.

In fact, Gu Ning wasn’t an ordinary student in their eyes. Instead, she was a very successful businesswoman whose companies had billions of yuan in assets. Most ordinary people stood in awe of her.

“You’re welcome. How do you feel now?” Gu Ning asked with concern.

“I’m good. I can finish the military training except for those strenuous exercises, in case I have another attack. Our instructor is giving me priority. I don’t need to stand at attention or run. I only need to do other gentle activities,” said Zhou Jiahao.

“That’s great,” Gu Ning said.

Gu Ning didn’t tell Zhou Jiahao that he actually wasn’t likely to have another attack of the illness after taking her medicine. He could do the military poses like standing at attention or running.

However, it didn’t mean that his illness was fully cured, so Gu Ning couldn’t tell him. What if he had another attack during the military poses or running?

They could never be too careful!

“Um, Gu Ning, my parents want to invite you to share a meal together this afternoon in order to thank you. Are you free? We’ll just dine in the restaurant outside our school,” said Zhou Jiahao.

“No need, please tell your parents that I’ve already received their kindness.” Gu Ning declined. She didn’t disdain them, but simply thought it wasn’t necessary.

“Well...” Zhou Jiahao knew that Gu Ning might decline, but he somehow didn’t know what to say when she really did.

“Alright, we should go now. See you,” said Gu Ning, then walked away.

Since she said that, Zhou Jiahao didn’t insist. When Gu Ning was far away, he called his father and told him Gu Ning’s answer.

Baili Zongxue and Song Miaoge didn’t bother to ask Gu Ning why she declined, because they wouldn’t accept the invitation either. It was unnecessary after all.

The three of them had a walk around the playground for a while, then the afternoon’s military training began.

After several days, they were used to it so not many students moaned in pain this time, but some girls complained about another thing.

Because they stood under the hot sun these days, many of them were tanned. Even Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao had become darkened.

Gu Ning and Song Miaoge, however, weren’t tanned at all.

Although the magical power of the Blood of the Phoenix didn’t get into her body, her body was nourished by it because it was inside her body. Therefore, it could protect her from being harmed by outside damage.

Gu Ning’s skin wasn’t affected by the sunlight after she stood under the hot sun for days.

Song Miaoge, however, used the Kouzi sunscreen Gu Ning gave her. Because it was added with magical power, it was quite effective.

Kouzi sunscreen could protect her skin from being burned by the sun, and it could also moisturize and whiten her skin. Therefore, Song Miaoge wasn’t tanned, but became slightly whiter, which made many girls jealous of her, including Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao.

Both Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao ached to ask her what brand of sunscreen she used, but it was too embarrassing because they had a grudge.

Actually, Gu Ning had mentioned it before, but Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao were too scared at that time to hear it. As a result, when Song Miaoge and Gu Ning were absent, Gao Shiyan secretly searched around their beds and bookshelves trying to find the sunscreen, but unfortunately she failed.

Their closets were locked, so she couldn’t open them.

Even though she was quite careful, the beds were different now. Given Gu Ning’s photographic memory, she easily noticed that someone had done something to her bed. Without further thinking, she immediately realized that it must be Gao Shiyan.

After checking it for a while, Gu Ning found nothing wrong about it, so she didn’t bother to point it out.

Actually, there were many girls who weren’t tanned too, because they were loyal customers of Kouzi. They had prepared Kouzi sunscreen specially for the military training.

Other girls who were tanned were quite envious of them and kept asking them whether it was because of their skin quality or sunscreen of a certain brand.

Those untanned girls weren’t sure whether it was because of their skin quality, but they used sunscreen of the same brand, which was Kouzi.

Accordingly, everyone believed that it must be Kouzi sunscreen which prevented them from being tanned.

Song Miaoge was also asked that question by her classmates, so she seized this great chance to promote Gu Ning’s company. She told them it was because of Kouzi sunscreen.

It was the truth. She had received military training in a military camp before and she had become tanned in a few days. It took her months to become lighter again.
