2982 It’s Indeed Not Pleasant

There weren’t many people in the private room. Only Han Yu, Ji Yanxi, and one of Ji Yanxi’s subordinates were present.

Because they were all aware of Han Yu’s hidden injury, they didn’t need to be avoided.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t remove her mask until she was in the private room.

Ji Yanxi was shocked when he saw Leng Xiaoyao without any make-up, because she was a stunning beauty with make-up on, but when she didn’t put on any make-up, she was much less attractive.

!!

Although she had fine and delicate features, the freckles on her face overshadowed her beauty. She wasn’t ugly, but she wasn’t beautiful either.

Even Han Yu, who had seen Leng Xiaoyao before, also felt slightly shocked.

“Do you think I look totally different with and without make-up?” Looking at Ji Yanxi, Leng Xiaoyao joked. She didn’t care about their reaction, because she fully accepted herself.

Anyway, she would get rid of the freckles sooner or later, but not right now.

“Well.” Ji Yanxi felt embarrassed and said, “You look very different, but I think you have delicate features. If you can remove the freckles, you’ll be much prettier.”

“I know, but I’m not in a rush to do that. I’ll do it after the National College Entrance Examination,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She sat down on the sofa across from them, but no one judged her.

After Leng Xiaoyao sat down, her sight fell on Han Yu. “Mr. Han, you can ask me if you have any questions.”

“You said that you know my secret. Can you tell me what it is?” Han Yu asked.

“Your secret is a hidden injury caused by a bullet many years ago. Because it’s near the heart, it’s extremely dangerous to do an operation and it might not succeed. You didn’t do anything and the bullet was left in your body. Although your life is safe for the time being, you’re in a bad condition. So, you must remove the bullet as soon as possible,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Even though Han Yu was unhappy when Leng Xiaoyao said that, he didn’t vent his anger on her.

“Can you remove the bullet?” Han Yu asked.

“Of course, otherwise why would I bring it up?” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“How likely are you to succeed?” Han Yu asked. No one was unafraid of death. He obviously didn’t want to place himself in danger.

“The probability is 90%. Will you trust it?” Leng Xiaoyao replied. In fact, she was 100% confident that she could remove the bullet, but she didn’t want to make that promise right now.

Honestly, the probability of 90% already surprised Han Yu and the others. They didn’t know whether they should be happy about it, or doubt her. It was what they wanted, but they felt that she was exaggerating.

Even famous medical experts said that the probability was only about 30%.

Han Yu didn’t dare to have the operation precisely because the probability was so low.

“Miss Leng, are you joking?” Han Yu’s secretary askes. He seriously doubted her words.

“Of course not! Why would I joke with Mr. Han? What can I get from that?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“I feel more anxious precisely because you want nothing,” Han Yu’s secretary replied. His words made sense.

“If so, why don’t you pay me? Um, how much should I ask for?” Leng Xiaoyao said, seeming to carefully think about it. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hearing that, the others only thought Leng Xiaoyao was a little strange.

Han Yu’s secretary was slightly displeased.

“Miss Leng, as long as you can heal me, even if you want nothing, I’ll still give you a high remuneration, but if I get worse because of you, I won’t hesitate to pay you back even though you are Leng Yecheng’s niece. Besides, even your uncle would be affected because of you. You might be angered by my words. After all, you’re willing to help me out of kindness, but we have different stands, so I hope that you can understand me. If you refuse to treat me because you’re mad at me, I won’t force you,” Han Yu said.

He was always cautious, so left with no choice, he threatened Leng Xiaoyao.

“It’s indeed unpleasant, but I can understand. However, after hearing your thoughts, I have decided to change my mind. I didn’t want anything in return before today, but now I do. Otherwise I would seem like an idiot. I don’t want to waste my time and energy. After all, I offered to heal you simply because you’re my uncle’s friend. You have your concern, and I have mine,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

She understood Han Yu’s worries, but she was also displeased by his words.

If he only threatened her, she wouldn’t mind nor would she be mad, but he mentioned Leng Yecheng as well.

In that case, Leng Xiaoyao felt that Leng Yecheng clearly wasn’t that important to Han Yu.

Actually, if Han Yu hadn’t helped Leng Yecheng a lot, she wouldn’t bother to help him.

So now she would still heal him, but she would ask for money in return.

If she didn’t ask for a lot of money, Han Yu might think that she was valueless.

“If I successfully heal you, you need to pay me fifty million yuan. If I don’t, you can do whatever you want to punish me. It’s up to you to accept the condition, but this is the last chance I will give you. After I go out of this door, I won’t change my mind no matter how much you’re willing to pay me.”

Hearing the price, they were displeased at once, but Leng Xiaoyao asked for a fortune because she was angered by Han Yu’s words. Therefore, they didn’t think it was wrong.

None of them blamed Leng Xiaoyao. After all, she didn’t ask for anything at the beginning.

“No problem.” Although the price was higher than Han Yu’s expectation, he agreed in order to feel more relieved.

He knew that he had angered Leng Xiaoyao and understood that she was willing to treat him because of Leng Yecheng. If it hadn’t been for Leng Yecheng, Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t have asked to heal him. Therefore, he didn’t want to annoy her again.

“Great, it’s a deal, but I can’t do the operation right now, because I need more time and medicines. We can do it on Sunday. What do you think?” Leng Xiaoyao said.
