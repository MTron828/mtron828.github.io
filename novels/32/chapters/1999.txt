Chapter 2001: Being Too Modest Is Being Hypocritical

“Ha-ha, Ha-ha.”

Hearing that, the crowd burst into laughter, filled with mockery. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The girl came back to her senses and felt quite embarrassed, but it was already done. She couldn’t take her words back. After giving Chu Peihan a glare, she ran away.

“Let’s go and see!” she said.

Obviously, the girl would take revenge, but Gu Ning and her friends weren’t afraid at all.

Once it was done, Gu Ning and her friends left. They walked out of the crowd and saw Han Chenglin and his two close friends standing nearby staring at them. The three of them looked very amazed. They had witnessed the whole process of Gu Ning hitting the red spot with 10 darts, but they were afraid that Chu Peihan might beat them again, so they didn’t dare to talk to them.

It turned out that Chu Peihan’s friends were even more outstanding than her.

The moment Chu Peihan saw Han Chenglin, she looked annoyed, but Han Chenglin kept a distance from her, so she said nothing.

Afterwards, they walked in another direction. However, Han Chenglin and his friends followed them neither far or near. Chu Peihan felt displeased, so she turned around trying to teach them a lesson, but Gu Ning stopped her.

“Alright, there are so many people around. It’s a public place. It’s not appropriate if you go over and attack them. Let them follow if they want, as long as they don’t bother us,” said Gu Ning. She didn’t hate Han Chenglin, so she thought it wasn’t necessary to be violent.

Since Gu Ning said that, Chu Peihan did nothing. After carefully thinking about it, she also didn’t think it was a good solution, so she stopped paying attention to them.

At the same time, Xie Yiyi looked upset after playing darts.

“Yiyi, what’s wrong? Do you know that girl?” Xie Yiyi’s female friend asked. They were both women, so she could see Xie Yiyi’s attitude towards Gu Ning wasn’t good.

“Nothing. I don’t know her,” said Xie Yiyi and went back to normal at once because she didn’t want her friends to have a negative opinion about her.

Since she said that, Xie Yiyi’s friend stopped asking her more questions. If Xie Yiyi didn’t know the girl, she must be jealous of the girl because the girl was pretty and incredibly good at darts.

In fact, Xie Yiyi’s friend was slightly jealous of Gu Ning as well, so she wouldn’t disdain Xie Yiyi just because Xie Yiyi was jealous of Gu Ning.

…

Gu Ning and the others hung around for a while and were about to leave at 5 pm.

Han Chenglin and his friends followed them all the time, but they didn’t dare to disturb them. They only kept an appropriate distance from them.

Seeing them leaving, they left the park too, but they stopped following them this time.

“Wow, a girl has a Hummer. She’s indeed special,” said Han Chenglin, watching Gu Ning driving with her friends away.

“I’m starving. Shouldn’t we go to have some food now?” Han Chenglin’s friend complained. Although it was early, he was quite hungry.

“Let’s go!” Han Chenglin shrugged, then they walked to a black car.

He studied in the same school as Chu Peihan anyway and they met every day. He didn’t rush to bother her right now.

Gu Ning and her friends went to a local roasted duck restaurant, but because all the private rooms were reserved, they could only dine in the hall. However, they didn’t actually care about that. In fact, there were more diners in the hall, which improved their appetite.

Coincidentally, shortly after Gu Ning and her friends arrived and half of the dishes they ordered were on the table, Xie Yiyi and her friends walked inside.

Gu Ning didn’t care or bother to pay attention to them, but Xie Yiyi slightly changed her expression when she saw Gu Ning. Afterwards, they walked to a private room.

“Boss, do you know that woman?” asked Chu Peihan. She felt Xie Yiyi’s unkind look at Gu Ning.

“Nope,” Gu Ning said.

“Well, it seemed she was heavily hit by you when you successfully hit the red spot with 10 darts. She must be jealous of you,” said Chu Peihan confidently. She believed it was the truth.

“I think so. I guess being too outstanding can easily arouse other people’s jealousy,” said Gu Ning, purposely arrogant.

“Ha-ha, boss, you’re becoming more and more narcissistic! Anyway, you’re indeed very outstanding, but it somehow feels different when you say it aloud,” said Chu Peihan with disdain.

“Being too modest is being hypocritical,” said Gu Ning, seeming serious.

“Fine, you win!” Chu Peihan gave up. She could never defeat Gu Ning in an argument.

After Gu Ning and her friends finished the meal, they had a walk to better digest the food before Gu Ning drove them back to the school.

Because Leng Shaoting was still in the capital, Gu Ning didn’t go back to her school tonight, nor would she go tomorrow. Anyway, she didn’t tell them when she would be back when she asked for leave from her teacher. She could report back whenever she wanted.

In that case, she seemed to be a really bad student, but it wasn’t because she was in a romantic relationship with someone. She needed to deal with some serious things.

…

Yuan Wenrui sent someone to the Shen family’s house to find the contract he had signed with Shen Yanfeng, but failed. Shen Yanfeng immediately realized that it must have been taken away by Leng Shaoting.

Even though he had already figured out a way to handle it, Yuan Wenrui still felt anxious because it would damage the Yuan family’s reputation to some extent. He wished that he could protect the Yuan family’s reputation.

At 10 am the next day, Yuan Wenrui was having a meeting at the company when the police visited. They said that he had something to do with Shen Yanfeng’s drug-trafficking and he needed to go to the Public Security Bureau.

It wasn’t surprising, but Yuan Wenrui was still very nervous when he finally faced it. On the surface, he forced himself to be calm.

Besides, he must be calm in front of the senior management. He must stop people from thinking that he really had a deal with Shen Yanfeng.

“Shen Yanfeng? Great. How dare he defame me! Doesn’t he care about his family’s reputation?” said Yuan Wenrui in anger, as if he was framed and innocent.

When Yuan Wenrui said that, he was implying the Leng family because Shen Yanfeng was a member of the Leng family’s faction and he was also the Leng family’s relative.

Some senior managers indeed had the doubt that Yuan Wenrui might have a dirty deal with Shen Yanfeng, but they realized what had happened after his angry questions. They stopped being suspicious of Yuan Wenrui, and started suspecting the Leng family.

Everyone was aware of the Yuan family’s relationship with the Leng family, so many people would believe that the Leng family had framed the Yuan family.

“I’ll go with you to see what exactly has happened. I won’t submit to the humiliation.” Yuan Wenrui understood that he couldn’t run away, but he must make up a good reason for himself.

After that, Yuan Wenrui left with the police and it became shocking news in the Yuan Organization.
