Chapter 2127: A Reminder from Mo Qilin

After a pause, Mo Qilin continued, “I didn’t steal her stuff, so I wouldn’t agree to let them search me. It’s humiliating, so we had a fight. Because master told me not to use magical skills on mortals, I almost lost because the two people were very good at fighting. Right as I was about to use magical skills, Gu Ning showed up and defeated them. She saved me.”

“Who are the two people?” Yun Zhiyan asked with a frown.

Given his understanding of Gu Ning, he knew it was very normal that she was able to defeat the two people when Mo Qilin was no match for them.

“No idea. They simply wanted money. They apologized to me afterwards and I was fine, so I told them to leave,” said Mo Qilin. He didn’t know the real purpose of the two people, so he believed that they just wanted to extort money from him.

After hearing Mo Qilin’s account, Yun Zhiyan said nothing further about that.

“If so, take me with you. As your senior, I must thank Gu Ning in person,” said Yun Zhiyan.

Mo Qilin knew what Yun Zhiyan was thinking, so he refused without hesitation. “No.”

“Why? I won’t hurt her.” Yun Zhiyan cocked his eyebrow.

Even if Yun Zhiyan knew that Gu Ning had what they wanted, he didn’t follow or spy on her. Not everyone would try to get what they wanted by hook or by crook.

However, since Mo Qilin had a relationship with Gu Ning, he wanted to seize this chance and meet Gu Ning too.

“Because Gu Ning doesn’t want me to take people there. She asked me whether I’m alone. I said yes, so she agreed to dine with me. What if she’s mad at me for taking you there?” Mo Qilin said.

Mo Qilin was deceiving Yun Zhiyan, but he was indeed worried that Gu Ning might be mad if he took Yun Zhiyan there.

Since he said that, Yun Zhiyan had to give up. “Alright, you can go alone now.”

“Sure, bye-bye, Senior Zhiyan.” Hearing that, Mo Qilin felt absolved and quickly walked away.

Looking at Mo Qilin’s back, Yun Zhiyan shook his head resignedly.

…

Because the specialty restaurant Mo Qilin chose wasn’t far from where he stayed, he could normally reach there in ten minutes on foot. This time, he ran there and arrived in three minutes.

About ten minutes later, Gu Ning came.

The moment Mo Qilin saw Gu Ning, he was excited and stood up to greet her. “Hi, Gu Ning, have a seat please!”

Saying that, Mo Qilin immediately pulled out a chair for Gu Ning.

“Thanks.” Gu Ning thanked him before sitting down. After that, Mo Qilin handed the menu to Gu Ning. “Gu Ning, please order whatever you want to eat. Take it as a friends’ gathering.”

“Sure.” Gu Ning took the menu and began to read it. She ordered two dishes she liked.

Although Gu Ning took Mo Qilin as her friend, there were only two of them and they couldn’t eat much. Therefore, she ordered two dishes, then returned the menu to Mo Qilin.

“Just two?” Mo Qilin asked. He thought Gu Ning felt embarrassed to order more food.

“There are just two of us. I don’t want to waste food,” said Gu Ning.

Hearing that, Mo Qilin was a little awkward. “You’re right.”

Then, Mo Qilin also ordered two dishes: one was fried beef and the other was mushroom soup.

After the waiter left the room, Mo Qilin began to compliment Gu Ning again. “Gu Ning, how did you become so successful within just a year? It’s really amazing.”

Gu Ning briefly told him the story, and Mo Qilin still admired her more than ever.

“Oh, Gu Ning, I need to tell you something.” All of a sudden, Mo Qilin became serious.

“What is it?” Gu Ning cocked her eyebrow.

“I heard it by accident the other day. Two people were talking about something you carry with you and they want it. They also said they had already sent someone to follow and spy on you. I don’t know what the thing is nor who those people are, but you must be careful,” said Mo Qilin.

In fact, Mo QIlin knew what the thing was. He also knew who those people were. However, he couldn’t tell Gu Ning or it would be hard for him to explain it if the truth was exposed.

Even if Mo Qilin didn’t tell her, Gu Ning knew why he kept it a secret, so she didn’t bother to ask him about it. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Thanks, I’ll be more careful.” Gu Ning thanked him.

“You don’t need to say that.” Mo Qilin was embarrassed and scratched his head. At the same time, he felt a little guilty. He couldn’t tell Gu Ning, nor help Gu Ning stop those people. He could only hope that those people wouldn’t harm Gu Ning.

After the meal, they walked out. Mo Qilin went to pay the bill and Gu Ning walked out first. However, as soon as she came out, Gu Ning noticed a man standing beside the door. Something was wrong, so she observed him calmly.

The man wore a peaked cap and a mask, staring at the gate the entire time. He looked nervous and his eyes were full of murderous intent. Besides, in the sleeve of the man’s right hand, there was a fruit knife of twenty centimeters in length. It seemed he was going to assassinate someone.

As soon as Gu Ning finished observing him, the man acted, revealing the fruit knife, holding it tightly in his hand, and quickly walked toward the door.

At this moment, two young men just walked out of the door, and it was obvious that the man with the fruit knife came for one of them.

Gu Ning didn’t know the purpose of this person’s murder, whether he wanted to kill a good person or a bad person, but she had to do something precisely because she knew nothing about the situation.

The accident happened too suddenly for the two men. By the time they noticed, the man with the knife had already reached them. They wanted to avoid it, but it was too late so they turned pale in fright.

People around him also froze in fright. Seeing that the knife was going to stab the one man, timid people closed their eyes one after another, not wanting to see the bloody scene.

However, just when everyone felt that the man was doomed to die, the fruit knife stopped. It was only ten centimeters away from the man’s chest.

A slender hand grabbed the wrist of the man holding the knife, then, with a “crack”, the man’s wrist was dislocated, and the knife in his hand fell because he couldn’t hold it.

The next second, Gu Ning kicked the man’s abdomen. The man was kicked aside and fell to the ground. It was so painful that he couldn’t get up for a while.

After people came back to their senses, they were all surprised. This girl was too amazing.
