He brought Jing Yunyan to meet Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning simply to help them remember Jing Yunyan’s face. After remembering Jing Yunyan’s face, they could better stop him from winning a prize.

“I can’t promise that they’ll agree to team up with you, so the result isn’t up to me,” said Jing Jining.

Jing Yunyan didn’t know Jing Jining’s real purpose, and thought that Jing Jining agreed to help him in fear of his father.

“Sure,” said Jing Yunyan.

In fact, Jing Yunyan was unwilling to team up with Shangguan Yang’s disciples because he disliked them. Even if they hadn’t met yet, he was already jealous of them because they and their master were all at a higher level than most cultivators. However, for the best benefits, he had to team up with them so that he was more likely to win a prize.

Although he was stronger than most of the participants in this game, he had strong competitors as well. If he didn’t have any sense of crisis, he would fail.

As long as there were more than three people in the Golden Core Stage, he was likely to lose. No matter how likely it was, he was reluctant to see it happen. Therefore, Jing Jining brought Jing Yunyan to see Gu Ning and the others.

At this moment, Gu Ning and the others were still touring around. Jing Jining didn’t know where they were, but he could easily figure it out by asking several disciples here.

After finding Gu Ning and the others, Leng Shaoting, Gu Ning, and Shangguan Yang realized Jing Jining’s purpose as soon as they saw Jing Yunyan.

As a result, they weren’t displeased because Jing Jining brought Jing Yunyan to see them without their permission. However, when Leng Shaoting saw Jing Yunyan, he got angry, but soon calmed down. Ning Xu who didn’t know the reason paid little attention to Leng Shaoting’s emotional change. He thought that Leng Shaoting was simply unhappy for Jing Jining’s sudden appearance with a stranger.

“Hi, Senior Ning!” Jing Yunyan greeted Ning Xu who he was familiar with first.

“Hi, Junior Jing,” said Ning Xu.

“This is Senior Shangguan. These two are Senior Shangguan’s disciples.” Jing Jining introduced the others to Jing Yunyan.

“Nice to see you, Senior Shangguan and everyone. I’m the disciple of the fourth elder. I’m also Jing Jining’s younger cousin. My name’s Jing Yunyan,” said Jing Yunyan very politely to them.

“Hi,” said Shangguan Yang in a flat voice. He didn’t do it on purpose, but it was his attitude towards strangers. Shangguan Yang was only enthusiastic about people and things he was familiar with.

“Hi, Junior Jing.”

“Hi, Senior Jing.”

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning replied to him as calmly as they treated strangers; they had no intention of embarrassing him.

Even if they came here to make things difficult for Jing Yunyan, they couldn’t show that on their faces.

Leng Shaoting disliked this young uncle who was at the same age as him, but he didn’t hold strong hostility towards him.

Because Jing Yunyan was born after Jing Yunyao had the terrible accident, it had nothing to do with him. There was no reason for Leng Shaoting to blame him, but he was unwilling to stay with him because he was Jing Yaorong’s son.

“Alright, the competition is about to begin. Let’s go to the square now,” said Ning Xu.

After that, they went to the square together.

For now, Jing Yunyan didn’t propose teaming up with Leng Shaoting yet, he decided to talk about it later.

When they arrived at the square, there were already many people, including Baili Zongyang and Baili Zongxue. Dongfang Ziyu was also present. They all stood at the square. Some were busy chatting around, searching for teammates.

Because Gu Ning had a different name now, she couldn’t go to talk with her familiar friends.

Gu Ning hadn’t thought about the idea of teaming up with Baili Zongxue, because she knew that every family would send several members to take part in the game. They perhaps had already teamed up with their family members.

The Jing family had that plan as well, but unfortunately Jing Yunyan was far better than his relatives. Besides, Shangguan Yang’s disciples showed up, so they changed their plan. If Jing Yunyan was turned down, they would carry out their original plan.

After arriving at the square, Ning Xu took Shangguan Yang and Jing Jining to see Bai Lingtian and the others, because Bai Lingtian arranged for a seat for Shangguan Yang next to them.

It was a grand competition, so the patriarchs of the four major families would all come. They also sat with Bai Lingtian.

Jing Jining didn’t go to sit with the Jing family, but with Shangguan Yang, which was Shangguan Yang’s request. Shangguan Yang made the excuse that he needed Jing Jining’s company, so Tiandaozong agreed.

Once Ning Xu left with Shangguan Yang and Jing Jining, Jing Yunfei said to Leng Shaoting, “Senior Qing He, why don’t we team up? It’s more likely for us to win if we’re in the same team.”

Although Jing Yunyan went to team up with Leng Shaoting, he didn’t seem to beg him. Instead, it seemed that he was kindly giving Leng Shaoting an offer, as if it would bring Leng Shaoting instead of him a great advantage.

“I don’t think so,” said Leng Shaoting with an expressionless face.

Jing Yunyan didn’t have much hope, but he was still displeased when he heard Leng Shaoting’s answer. Instantly, he showed obvious anger on his face. However, he had his pride. Since he was turned down, he wouldn’t mention it again, otherwise it would seem that he was longing to team up with Leng Shaoting.

Nevertheless, he hated Leng Shaoting even deeper after being embarrassed. Therefore, Jing Yunyan made up his mind to teach Leng Shaoting a lesson.

“Well, if so, forget it. See you,” said Jing Yunyan, then he turned around and walked away.

“Funny!” The moment Jing Yunyan left, Gu Ning sneered. “Team up with him? We’re going to beat him heavily!”

Leng Shaoting didn’t chime in, but he actually had the same idea. They weren’t only going to stop Jing Yunyan from winning a prize, they would also teach him a lesson.

They originally didn’t have the idea because there was no grudge between Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyan, but Jing Yunyan annoyed them!

“Oh, will you blame me for teaming up with Mo Qilin without asking for your opinion? I met him once before, and he left a good impression on me, so I invited him to join us,” said Gu Ning to Leng Shaoting. They didn’t stop her earlier, which meant they agreed, but she felt she needed to explain it clearly.

However, because Ning Xu was present, she didn’t say much about it.

“Not at all,” said Leng Shaoting. Mo Qilin was a young kid, so he wouldn’t be jealous.

Mo Qilin was only 16, so he was indeed a kid in Leng Shaoting’s eyes.. He was even younger than Gu Ning, and Leng Shaoting didn’t mind it if he spent some time with Gu Ning as friends.
