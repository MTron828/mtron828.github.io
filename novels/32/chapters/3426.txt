3429 Want to Learn Martial Arts

“I-I don’t have any private money left!” Zhang Hongyu said weakly. She had used her own money to support her family. That was why she turned to Tang Lei for help with Zhang Chenglong’s situation.

Tang Lei got angry at once, glaring at her. “Zhang Hongyu, will you only be satisfied when I’m ruined by you?”

Zhang Hongyu was shocked. “How could I want to ruin you? Don’t you know how I feel about you?”

She had even killed for Tang Lei!

He was her everything. It was impossible for her to ruin him!

In fact, she wanted Tang Lei to be more and more successful, that is why she hoped to see Old Master Tang and Tang Lei’s uncle die.

“I know you don’t want to ruin me, but your actions are doing just that. Don’t you know what’s going on with the company now? I may have a large share, but the company isn’t just mine. The money isn’t just for me to spend as I please. Over the past year, your family has taken millions of yuan from me, and now they’re causing trouble everywhere. Are you trying to give my uncle a reason to attack me?” Tang Lei was angry. He knew that his wife loved him, but her excessive generosity towards her family was a weakness.

“I…” Zhang Hongyu didn’t know what to say for a while, and realized the seriousness of the matter, but if Tang Lei didn’t help her, what should she do?

“What about my brother? If I don’t help him, my parents will be upset with me,” Zhang Hongyu said helplessly.

“I told you not to spoil them before. Now that you’re in trouble, you want my help? If you want to help them so much, sell your jewelry. If you continue to sabotage me, we’ll divorce. Don’t try to threaten me with anything, or I’ll punish your family if they dare to drag me into trouble,” Tang Lei said before leaving.

Zhang Hongyu was stunned. She knew that Tang Lei meant what he said. If he hadn’t mentioned the last sentence, she might have tried to threaten him with something else, but she had to give up.

…

Li Mochen, who had gone to get the account book, listened to their conversation along with Leng Xiaoyao.

He and Leng Xiaoyao left together without being noticed when Tang Lei left.

On their way back, they talked about it.

“What should we do to deal with Tang Lei? The evidence we have is enough to put him in jail for life, but then the Tang family’s business will be in serious trouble. If your grandpa can wake up, we can directly take back the shares. After all, Tang Lei’s ownership of the shares isn’t from your grandpa’s transfer, but from his inheritance as a son,” said Li Mochen.

“We’ll wait for my grandpa to wake up. Although we only have a 50% probability, we’ll do our best first. If he doesn’t wake up, we’ll take the books and sue Tang Lei directly,” said Leng Xiaoyao. She didn’t want to ruin the Tang family’s business. The Tang Corporation belonged to the Tang family and Tang Xing along with his sister.

After all, her own assets were far less than theirs. There was no reason for her to disdain it.

“Next, let’s investigate Uncle Tang’s situation and see if he can be of use to us. If not, we should at least know his situation to know how to handle it,” said Leng Xiaoyao.

“No problem, just leave it to me,” said Li Mochen. The investigation involved not only computer research, but also interviews as well.

After all, what could be investigated on the computer was just some information recorded on the computer, such as ID card usage information, call log information, monitoring information and their computer registration information

If someone wanted to commit a crime, they had to be sneaky. Only some unavoidable registration would be left.

“Great.” Leng Xiaoyao agreed because she couldn’t handle it by herself.

After returning to Hanlin Manor, it was still early, only 9 pm. Tang Xing and Tang Ning were still watching TV in the living room with Tong Xianglan.

There were many people in the house, so Li Mochen didn’t feel embarrassed to go in this time. He followed Leng Xiaoyao inside, and planned to leave later.

When Tang Xing and Tang Ning saw Leng Xiaoyao come back, they immediately went out to welcome her.

“Sister, you’re back.”

Both of them were very happy.

“Hi!” Leng Xiaoyao smiled, then picked up Tang Ning. She asked her with concern, “Is your head still hurting?”

“No.” Tang Ning replied.

Leng Xiaoyao suddenly had the thought of teaching them martial arts, but she still had to ask for their opinions. She asked, “Xing, Ning, do you want to learn martial arts? So that you won’t have to be afraid of being bullied in the future. You’ll have the ability to protect yourself when in danger.”

Tang Xing’s eyes lit up and he eagerly said, “I want to learn martial arts. Sister, can you teach me?”

The years of begging had caused them to be bullied a lot. At that time, they were thinking that if they knew martial arts, they wouldn’t have been bullied.

Although they wouldn’t suffer any longer, who knew what would happen in the future?

Besides, Tang Ning was just bullied by a classmate today!

“I want to learn too,” Tang Ning also said. Since her brother wanted to learn, she wanted to learn too. She didn’t want to be bullied again.

“But learning martial arts is very hard! You have to get up at 5:30 am every day and jog for half an hour,” Leng Xiaoyao said. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I’m not afraid of hardship,” Tang Xing firmly said. He knew that learning martial arts was very difficult, but nothing ventured, nothing gained!

After all, he still wanted revenge!

“I’m not afraid of hardship either,” Tang Ning said.

“Okay, Tang Xing will jog with me tomorrow morning. Tang Ning just got injured and needs to rest for two more days. I’m usually busy and can’t teach you personally all the time, so I’ll find a master to teach you,” Leng Xiaoyao said, looking at Li Mochen.

Before she could say anything, Li Mochen opened his mouth. “Leave it to me!”

Leng Xiaoyao felt so touched by how Li Mochen had been helping her these days!

“Thanks.” Leng Xiaoyao answered.

Li Mochen left shortly after that. Leng Xiaoyao also asked Tang Xing and Tang Ning to take a shower and go to bed immediately.

Although Leng Xiaoyao was used to staying up late, Tang Xing and Tang Ning were still children and shouldn’t go to sleep later than 10 pm.

On the other hand, Leng Xiaoyao could stay up until midnight without any problem.

The next morning at 5:30, Tang Xing was already downstairs waiting for Leng Xiaoyao. Li Mochen was also waiting outside.

Once Leng Xiaoyao and Tang Xing walked out, they saw Li Mochen.

Then the three of them started their morning jog.

Despite being thin due to years of begging and not eating enough, Tang Xing had better stamina than normal children, so he could last for quite a while.
