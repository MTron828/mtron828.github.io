Chapter 589 Mr. Akino

“We didn’t want to worry you,” Tang Yunhang said.

Tang Jiakai wiped his eyes. “I prefer to be worried rather than being regretful now. I feel so guilty that I’ve been out having fun while our family was in danger.”

“We’re fine now, so don’t tell Jiayang about it,” Tang Yunhang said.

“I won’t,” Tang Jiakai said. He understood why his family hadn’t told him, because he was also unwilling to worry Tang Jiayang now.

“Oh, there is something else...” Tang Yunhang opened his mouth again but Tang Jiakai rounded his eyes, staring straight at him in fear before he could finish.

Seeing that, everyone was amused.

“Don’t be so nervous. It’s good news.” Tang Yunhang smiled.

Hearing that, Tang Jiakai was relieved. “What is it?”

“It’s about Ningning,” Tang Yunhang said. Tang Jiakai turned to look at Gu Ning at once with confusion. “Actually, Ningning is your Uncle Yunfan’s biological daughter,” Tang Yunhang added.

“What?” Tang Jiakai was shocked and stood up in excitement. “R-really?”

“Yes, but you can’t leak this information either,” Tang Yunhang said.

“Of course I won’t!” Tang Jiakai understood that his father said it for a reason.

Hearing the good news, Tang Jiakai was cheered up within a second. He ran to sit with Gu Ning and pushed Cao Wenxin aside

“Ningning, you’re really my younger sister. Biological younger sister!” Tang Jiakai said happily.

Tang Jiakai was a stable young man normally, but he now behaved like a kid who just got candy. He always wished that Gu Ning could be related to the Tang family and it turned out to be true now!

Although Tang Haifeng had already accepted Gu Ning as a member of their family before, there was still a distance between them. However, there was a family connection between them now, so they were much closer than before.

“Since Ningning is Uncle Yunfan’s biological daughter, then Ningning’s mother is...” Tang Jiakai said, but was interrupted by Gu Ning. “Not yet.”

Hearing that, Tang Jiakai realized that it wasn’t that easy. Tang Yunfan had been apart from Gu Man for so long and it was totally understandable that Gu Man couldn’t accept him right away.

After dinner, Gu Ning left the Tang family’s house with Cao Wenxin and Gu Man.

Tang Yunfan wasn’t able to show up now, so he could only watch Gu Man leaving from his sight.

On the way back, Gu Ning suddenly remembered that she hadn’t contacted Leng Shaoting yet ever since he left this morning. Gu Ning knew that Leng Shaoting had to be busy, so she didn’t call him.

At that moment, in the airport of City Teng, Leng Shaoting, Chen Meng and Xu Jinchen were in a car in a parking lot. They didn’t get out of the car and it seemed like they were waiting for something.

“Chen Meng, are you sure the information is accurate? They are criminals wanted by the international criminal police. Would they dare to take a plane to our country? Aren’t they afraid of being caught?” Xu Jinchen asked Chen Meng. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Chen Meng rolled his eyes and said with disdain, “Are you an idiot? Do you think that they’re as dumb as you? Don’t you know that there is a way of disguising called molding? They all hold fake passports and it’s impossible for the Customs to find them. If they could be easily caught, why would our country send us here?”

Chen Meng hit the point. The international criminal police failed to catch those criminals so the country sent out the Red Flame.

“I was just saying! They’re really desperadoes!” Xu Jinchen was less experienced than Leng Shaoting and Chen Meng, so he sometimes couldn’t stay calm.

“Those people will do anything for money,” Chen Meng said calmly.

After a while, Leng Shaoting heard Xin Bei’s voice from his earphones. “Boss, they’re out. Six in all.”

“Copy that,” Leng Shaoting said.

Six people weren’t all the members of the criminal group but was just a small team of it.

Before long, Xin Bei’s voice sounded again. “Boss, they entered the parking lot.”

Seconds later, Leng Shaoting and the others noticed six men in business suits walking into the parking lot. Although they were all dressed like businessmen they were stone-faced and looked more like bodyguards. Ordinary people might not see the difference, but it was quite clear in the eyes of Leng Shaoting’s group. They got in an MPV then left, followed by Leng Shaoting’s car.

In their car, several people were negotiating.

“Mr. Akino, I think that the price you gave is a bit high. Would you mind lowering it before we settle the deal? In this case, we can also share more reward.” A 30-year-old man sitting in the front passenger seat turned his head and looked at the young man sitting in a rear seat in the second row against the window. He was speaking in fluent Language R.

“Bai Zhen, I hope that you can understand that there are more buyers than us who wants to buy this batch of goods. They’re willing to make this deal with us all because we bid higher than others. If we lower the price now, they won’t sell the goods to us. If so, how should we explain it to the Andou family? Do you think the Andou family will let us get away with it?” Mr. Akino wore a cold expression and reminded Bai Zhen in an impatient tone.

“Mr. Akino is right. We can never annoy the Andou family,” another young man echoed.

“Fine!” Bai Zhen frowned. Although he was disappointed, he gave up because he knew that he couldn’t persuade them.

“I haven’t been to this country for a long time. It seems this country is declining. What do you think?” A young man sitting on a rear seat in the third row suddenly opened his mouth to cheer everyone up.
