3297 I Misread You

After all, Leng Yehua held a significant position in the government. If the news got out of hand, it wouldn’t be beneficial for the Gao family either.

“Why did you have to provoke Leng Xiaoyao?” Gao Zhongheng asked. His voice tinged with anger.

“I just don’t like her, and she doesn’t care about my reputation.” Gao Qilu replied defiantly.

“What did she do?” Gao Zhongheng asked. He knew exactly what his daughter was like. She was always the one bullying others. Given her status, not many dared to provoke her.

“I was just trying to talk to her, but she mocked me,” Gao Qilu said without a hint of guilt.

Her parents, however, didn’t believe that Leng Xiaoyao would mock Gao Qilu without a reason. Nevertheless, it wasn’t important. They didn’t feel guilty about it either.

Instead, they were suspicious of the Leng family and got angry.

“Could it have been the Leng family’s idea?” Mrs. Gao fumed.

She was angry? How could she be mad at Leng Xiaoyao? What right did she have to be angry? Her daughter had paid someone to throw sulfuric acid on a girl and tried to ruin her. If Leng Xiaoyao had been an ordinary girl, she would have been disfigured.

“It’s possible,” Gao Zhongheng said. Since the other students were from ordinary families, they wouldn’t have the ability to do such things.

“It must be Leng Xiaoyao! Dad, you have to avenge me! It has spread throughout the school. How can I still go there?” Gao Qilu insisted that it was Leng Xiaoyao. Even if it wasn’t, she didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to get off lightly. After all, she had intended to ruin Leng Xiaoyao.

Gao Zhongheng frowned. “It may not necessarily be the Leng family. After all, we have many enemies. Who knows if someone is using this matter to target the Gao family? We need to investigate it thoroughly.”

However, it wasn’t easy at all! The forums and Weibo all said that they couldn’t find the poster’s ID, so they didn’t know who posted it.

As a result, he could only try to find a hacker.

Upon hearing that, Gao Qilu was very resentful. She even showed her resentment openly. “Even if it’s not Leng Xiaoyao, I don’t want to see her doing well.”

Gao Zhongheng laughed out loud. “How will you make her suffer? Haven’t you learned your lesson? Would you have been exposed if you hadn’t caused trouble?”

“That was my carelessness. I found someone who was useless.” Gao Qilu defended herself cunningly. “As long as you help me, dad, we can make it happen. It’s not a big deal for you to deal with Leng Xiaoyao. It’s not like you have to deal with the whole Leng family.”

It was true that she just wanted to pay Leng Xiaoyao back, not the whole Leng family, because that was unnecessary.

“Paying Leng Xiaoyao back isn’t dealing with the whole Leng family? Do you think the Leng family won’t care if something happens to Leng Xiaoyao? Do you think only you have family members to back you up?” Gao Zhongheng said angrily, becoming even more dissatisfied with Gao Qilu. She was really brainless and didn’t think about the consequences of her actions.

“Even if we have to face the Leng family, there is nothing to be afraid of!” Gao Qilu argued. She didn’t take the Leng family seriously, so she dared to make things difficult for Leng Xiaoyao.

If it was a first or second-tier wealthy family, or a high-ranking official family, she wouldn’t dare to be so arrogant!

“You…” Gao Zhongheng was so angry that he couldn’t breathe. Unfortunately, at that moment, his wife chimed in. “As long as it’s done discreetly, no one will know.”

“Idiots! You have no idea what it means. Now that Qilu has run into trouble, instead of handling it properly and suppressing public opinion, you still want to cause trouble? Do you have sh*t in your brains? Do you think the Leng family is nothing? They may have connections in the government. I also heard that the Leng family has a good relationship with the An family and the Ling families!” Gao Zhongheng said.

“But they may not help the Leng family!” Mrs. Gao said, a little dissatisfied.

“What if they do?” Gao Zhongheng asked.

“…” Mrs. Gao opened her mouth, but couldn’t say anything.

“You’d better behave yourselves. If you cause trouble for the Gao family again, you can get out of here.” Gao Zhongheng was so angry that he didn’t want to talk to them anymore and left afterwards. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

For him, the Gao family’s business was more important than his wife and daughter.

Before long, Zhao Weihao called Gao Qilu and said, “Gao Qilu, I never thought you were this kind of person. You actually threw sulfuric acid on Leng Xiaoyao because of jealousy and often bullied your classmates. I was wrong about you.”

After finding out about what happened, Zhao Weihao was devastated. He couldn’t believe that Gao Qilu was so malicious, especially since he had liked her so much.

He knew that Gao Qilu was spoiled and aloof, but he never imagined that she could be so cruel as to pay someone to throw sulfuric acid on another person.

This news had caused his feelings for Gao Qilu to fade even more.

It had nothing to do with Leng Xiaoyao, rather it was Gao Qilu’s own actions.

His family had also heard the news. Although they didn’t blame Gao Qilu directly, they advised Zhao Weihao to stay away from her.

They had liked Gao Qilu before and wanted her to become their daughter-in-law, but now they didn’t dare to take that risk.

What if she also wanted to throw sulfuric acid at them when they had conflicts?

Zhao Weihao didn’t give Gao Qilu a chance to respond and quickly hung up the phone. Gao Qilu was so angry that she smashed her phone.

Although she didn’t like Zhao Weihao, she felt that he should prioritize her. However, now he accused her because of Leng Xiaoyao!

Leng Xiaoyao, it was Leng Xiaoyao again! It seemed that she wouldn’t be able to release her anger until she taught Leng Xiaoyao an unforgettable lesson.

At that moment, Gao Qilu’s mindset was that anyone who defended Leng Xiaoyao was going against her and would increase her resentment towards Leng Xiaoyao.

…

Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t care less about Gao Qilu. She went to meet up with the female teacher in charge at school before heading to the airport.

The female teacher was called Zhou Jing. She was a young teacher in her late twenties who was very pretty and looked gentle and quiet.

However, one shouldn’t be fooled by her appearance, because she was tough and had even learned Taekwondo.

The school arranged for Zhou Jing to be in charge because they were worried about any unexpected situations that might arise during the trip.

If they had assigned a delicate teacher, they would have to rely on Leng Xiaoyao to take care of the students!

In addition, Zhou Jing graduated from a university in the capital city and was somewhat familiar with the area, which made things easier.

Zhou Jing had a very good impression of Leng Xiaoyao. She used to hate Leng Xiaoyao, but Leng Xiaoyao was different now, so she didn’t hold any negative feelings towards her any longer.
