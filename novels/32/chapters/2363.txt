Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“We found thick magical energy at the back of the mountain, so we went over. We tried to open the tower at the beginning, but failed. We gave up in the end, then we roasted a chicken outside. My master smelt it and came out on his own. He saw my fiancé’s talent, and took him as his disciple. Then I brought him down the mountain.”

Gu Ning smiled.

“How about you? When did you become Senior Shangguan’s disciple?” asked Si Jin.

“It happened afterwards. I used to be a mortal, and I became a cultivator after going through a lot,” said Gu Ning.

“What? You became a cultivator after being a mortal?”

Jiang Liluo and Si Jin were shocked, because it was extremely rare.

“Yes,” Gu Ning said.

It impressed Jiang Liluo and Si Jin.

At this time, Gu Ning heard sounds of a car stopping outside. She thought that it should be Leng Shaoting, so she immediately stood up and went to open the door.

Once the door opened, Leng Shaoting strode inside. As soon as he saw Gu Ning, he walked faster towards her.

Leng Shaoting wanted to hug her, but he sensed two cultivators in the room, so he decided against it.

Because there were strangers, he felt embarrassed. However, when Gu Ning went to him, he still placed his hands on her shoulders. “Are you alright?” He sized her up.

Gu Ning put on a resigned smile and said, “Didn’t I tell you that I’m fine on the phone? I’m safe and sound.”

After making sure that Gu Ning was safe, Leng Shaoting was finally relieved.

“Here, let me introduce two people to you,” said Gu Ning, then she pulled Leng Shaoting into the house.

In the living room, Leng Shaoting finally met Jiang Liluo and Si Jin. When he walked inside, Jiang Liluo and Si Jin stood up to face him.

Although Leng Shaoting already sensed them before he walked in, he was still surprised and confused when he saw their clothes.

Because they were brought back by Gu Ning, Leng Shaoting treated them as guests. However, he always wore a cold face in front of strangers, so he seemed unhappy.

However, even if Leng Shaoting looked cold, Jiang Liluo and Si Jin didn’t sense any malice. They felt that perhaps he was used to keeping a distance from other people. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Shaoting, I met them at the ancient grave. He’s Jiang Liluo, while she’s Si Jin. They were kept in the coffins. Ma Shibiao opened the coffins by accident and they woke up after the Taoist talisman was removed. I thought they were ghosts at the beginning, but they turned out to be humans. After we talked, I learned that they’re also disciples of the Kunlun Sect. Their master is junior to Senior Shangguan, so we actually belong to the same sect. I brought them home and I plan to take them to visit Senior Shangguan. They’ll live with Senior Shangguan. Also, because they’ve slept for hundreds of years, they need time to learn about modern society before they take the next step,” said Gu Ning.

Leng Shaoting was surprised that they had been kept in the ancient grave for hundreds of years.

After Gu Ning introduced them to Leng Shaoting, she turned to Jiang Liluo and Si Jin. “Senior Jiang, Senior Si, this is my fiancé. He’s also senior to me. His name is Leng Shaoting. He’s a major general in our country. He’s a little introverted, and he’s used to keeping a distance from other people. Please don’t mind it.”

“It’s fine.”

Jiang Liluo and Si Jin didn’t mind it at all.

After that, they greeted Leng Shaoting. “Nice to meet you, Junior Leng.”

“Nice to meet you too, Senior Jiang, Senior Si.” Leng Shaoting greeted them too, doing his best to be gentle.

Since Gu Ning said that they were also disciples of the Kunlun Sect, Leng Shaoting believed it. Even if he didn’t trust them, he trusted Gu Ning.

Unless Gu Ning knew that they were fake and wanted to do something without pointing it out.

“Oh, have you eaten?” Gu Ning asked Leng Shaoting.

“Not yet, I rushed here once I got off the plane,” said Leng Shaoting, sounding aggrieved.

“I’ll cook noodles for you. You can chat with Senior Jiang and Senior Si for a while,” said Gu Ning.

“I’ll do it by myself. You can chat with Senior Jiang and Senior Si.” Leng Shaoting stopped Gu Ning right away. He didn’t want to bother her, and he had no idea what to talk to Jiang Liluo and Si Jin about. He wasn’t talkative after all.

“Fine.” Gu Ning understood his worries, so she didn’t insist. She took Jiang Liluo and Si Jin to sit down on the sofa, then had a video call with Shangguan Yang.

“Hey, Ningning, this is our first video call. Are you missing me?”

Once Shangguan Yang answered the call, he joked.

Hearing his voice, Jiang Liluo and Si Jin felt it was very familiar, and got excited.

Gu Ning didn’t turn the camera to Jiang Liluo and Si Jin. Instead, she talked with Shangguan Yang first.

“Yeah, but not really. I just don’t want you to end the video call if I deny it,” said Gu Ning and laughed.

“What a naughty girl you are!” Shangguan Yang was amused.

“Master, I need to talk with you about something serious. I have two people with me now. Do you know them?” Gu Ning said and turned the camera to Jiang Liluo and Si Jin.

The moment Shangguan Yang saw Jiang Liluo and Si Jin, he was shocked.

With a glance, he recognized them. That was the reason why he was astonished.

Jiang Liluo and Si Jin saw Shangguan Yang too. Because Shangguan Yang had the same face, although his clothes were different, Jiang Liluo and Si Jin recognized him with a glance too. Therefore, they excitedly called, “Uncle Shangguan!”

“Liluo, Jin!” Shangguan Yang was also thrilled to see them. It had been hundreds of years, and he didn’t expect to see them again. Tears welled up in his eyes at once.

Jiang Liluo and Si Jin cried.
