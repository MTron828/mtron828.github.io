2899 No Need to Save Money for Him

By the time they got back, it was already 5 pm. They couldn’t eat anything at this time, so they decided to eat later if they were hungry.

On the small island, they couldn’t receive signals, so Leng Shaoting didn’t see the missed calls until they were back to the house. His friend who lived in Niguli Island had called him.

Leng Shaoting didn’t call back at once, but asked Gu Ning, “My friend who lives here just called me. I think he might want to invite us to have a meal together. Do you want to go? If not, I’ll turn him down.”

“Of course we should go. He’s helped you a lot. We should buy him a meal instead,” Gu Ning replied. She wasn’t spoiled. Even if she didn’t want to go, she knew what she should do according to etiquette.

“Great.” Leng Shaoting replied. Then he called his friend back. He understood that Gu Ning would agree, but he cared about her feelings, so he still asked her. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Without surprise, Leng Shaoting’s friend indeed wanted to invite them to have a meal together. Leng Shaoting didn’t turn him down, but agreed and said that he would pay the bill.

His friend understood that he was very rich, so he agreed. In addition, Leng Shaoting said that he wouldn’t go if his friend didn’t agree, so his friend accepted the condition.

After that, his friend arranged for a chauffeur to drive them, otherwise they might not be able to find the road. Since they were eating in the city center, the house Leng Shaoting stayed in was still far away.

When Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting got back to the house, the chauffeur was already waiting for them outside, but Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting still needed to take a shower and change their clothes. After all, they had been diving in the ocean earlier, so the clothing they were wearing right now wasn’t clean or comfortable.

In order to save time, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting showered together. However, Leng Shaoting ended up sexually aroused.

Gu Ning pushed Leng Shaoting who was fondling her body away, then gave him a glare. “The chauffeur is waiting for us. Stop it!”

Leng Shaoting, however, felt aggrieved. “You’re so attractive that I can’t stop thinking about having sex with you.”

“Men really think with their d*ck. You can’t control yourself and you even blame me,” Gu Ning said, seeming unhappy.

“I only have that feeling for you. I won’t pay any attention to other women,” Leng Shaoting stared at Gu Ning and said sincerely.

Gu Ning snorted and kept quiet. She wrapped herself in a towel and walked out of the bathroom, in case Leng Shaoting totally lost control.

She believed Leng Shaoting’s words and was actually very happy that he was so attracted to her.

If her man lost interest in her, they would separate sooner or later.

Although it sounded overly sexual, it was the truth. Whether a couple was in a romantic relationship or marriage, they needed both love and sex.

Leng Shaoting put on a resigned smile, and understood that it wasn’t the right time to think about sex now. Therefore, he didn’t stop Gu Ning and wrapped himself in a towel too, then walked out.

After they changed their clothes, they went out. Because they were quick, the chauffeur didn’t have to wait for long.

Half an hour later, they arrived at the restaurant. It was a high-end clubhouse near the ocean. In addition to accommodation, it also provided many activities on the sea.

Leng Shaoting’s friend arrived there at 2 pm, along with two of his friends. He planned to buy Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning a meal, but Leng Shaoting insisted on paying the bill instead.

Leng Shaoting’s friend told him that he would be coming with two friends, and Leng Shaoting agreed. Therefore, when Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning arrived, there were two men and a woman sitting in the private room.

Leng Shaoting’s friend was a man who was about thirty years old and he was native form Country Hua. His family was from Country Hua, but he lived on Niguli Island in Country Yin for business.

“Shaoting, nice to see you! Been a while.” Once Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning walked inside, Leng Shaoting’s friend stood up to welcome them. He reached out his hand to shake hands with Leng Shaoting.

“Weiming, been a while!” Leng Shaoting greeted back.

Although Leng Shaoting looked cold, he had many friends. In fact, he had made friends with all kinds of people regardless of their family background.

Whether you were from a powerful family or not, he would treat you equally, but only people who were familiar with him would know that.

Therefore, Leng Shaoting’s friends were very reliable.

“This must be your wife!” Ren Weiming turned to look at Gu Ning and asked.

“Yes, this is my wife, Gu Ning.” Leng Shaoming introduced, then he said to Gu Ning, “Ningning, this is my friend, Ren Weiming.”

After that, they greeted each other.

“Nice to meet you, Gu Ning.”

“Nice to meet you too, Mr. Ren.”

Although Ren Weiming was a year older than Leng Shaoting, he was used to taking Leng Shaoting as his boss. Therefore, he greeted Gu Ning respectfully.

“Have a seat please!” Ren Weiming invited Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning to sit by the table.

After that, Ren Weiming introduced his friends to Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

“This is my friend, Luo Yunze. And this is his fiancée, Qin Youyou. They’re going to be married too, and they came here to take wedding photos,” Ren Weiming said.

When Qin Youyou saw Leng Shaoting, she was amazed and attracted to him at first glance. The next moment, she got jealous after moving her gaze to Gu Ning.

To be honest, Leng Shaoting was more handsome than Luo Yunze, and Gu Ning was prettier than Qin Youyou.

Leng Shaoting and Luo Yunze greeted each other.

After they were all seated, they started ordering.

“After you,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Alright, no need to save money for him. He’s really rich.” Ren Weiming was afraid that his two friends might hesitate to order what they wanted to eat, so he said that first.

Hearing that, Qin Youyou gave Leng Shaoting a glance with mixed emotions.

“Thanks!” Luo Yunze said, then he flipped the menu and asked Qin Youyou what she wanted to eat.

At the same time, Gu Ning read through another menu and ordered her favorites, which weren’t cheap.

After hearing what Gu Ning ordered, Qin Youyou raised her head and stared at Gu Ning with jealousy.

Qin Youyou couldn’t hide her feelings, because Gu Ning was too pretty and had such a handsome and rich husband.
