Chapter 1137 Fully Recover Within Several Days

If there were other people around them, they wouldn’t have directly killed those men, but there was nobody around, so it was very easy for them to deal with the result.Zi Beiying and her bodyguards got back in their car without delay and left soon.

Once Zi Beiying was in the car, she called Gu Ning.

“Gu Ning, could you please do me a favor? I just encountered trouble at XX Road. Can you help me tell K to hack the surveillance cameras along the road?” Zi Beiying said. They had killed several men after all.

“Are you injured?” Gu Ning had acute hearing and she sensed that Zi Beiying wasn’t right now.

“It’s not a big deal. I’m slightly injured,” Zi Beiying said.

She didn’t want Gu Ning to be worried about her.

“Do you have the pills I gave you?” Gu Ning asked.

“Oh, I forgot to bring them with me,” Zi Beiying said, then realized that she forgot to bring the pills Gu Ning had given her.

“Drive back to where we separated. I’ll see you there,” Gu Ning said.

Since it was an emergency, she had to go see Zi Beiying in person.

“Sure,” Zi Beiying said, then told Mengda to drive back to the intersection. She agreed to meet Gu Ning right now because she indeed needed treatment. Gu Ning’s pills were quite effective, and she believed that she would be fine.

If her family found out that she was injured, she might not be allowed to go outside again.

...

Leng Shaoting heard Gu Ning’s conversation with Zi Beiying, so he turned the car of his own accord.

Gu Ning called K at once and told him to help Zi Beiying. After that, she also called Xu Jinchen and told him that Zi Beiying was injured and that she was going to meet her at the intersection.

Gu Ning didn’t tell Xu Jinchen because she hoped that he could seize this chance to get closer to Zi Beiying, but because they were all friends. Zi Beiying was injured once they left her, so they should come back to take care of her.

...

When Xu Jinchen heard the news, he got nervous and worried. He sped up without hesitation and turned the car around.

“Jinchen, what’s wrong?” Xu Qinyin was a little scared.

“Gu Ning just told me that Miss Zi is injured,” Xu Jinchen said. Although he sounded calm, his hands were actually shaking.

“What?” Xu Qinyin was astonished. “Let’s go to see her right now.”

...

At this time, Zi Beiying and her bodyguards arrived at the intersection. Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting came a little while later.

The second Mengda saw Gu Ning’s car, he got out and opened the car door for her. Zi Beiying was hit by a bullet, and it was still in her body, so she was in a lot of pain and had to stay in the car.

Gu Ning had prepared the medicine before she came here. She noticed the wound on Zi Beiying’s arm when she saw Zi Beiying.

There was a bullet in Zi Beiying’s arm. Gu Ning asked nothing and directly told Zi Beiying to take a power crystal first, then she began to check the wound.

Afterwards, Gu Ning put down her backpack, then took out a box with all kinds of surgical tools inside. She kept it in the telepathic eye space at all times, in case she needed it.

Gu Ning adeptly removed the bullet from Zi Beiying’s arm. Because Zi Beiying had taken a power crystal, she didn’t feel much pain.

Leng Shaoting followed Gu Ning and got out of the car, but he didn’t get in Zi Beiying’s car and stayed outside. Zi Beiying was a woman after all, so he should move his eyes away.

...

Before long, Xu Jinchen and Xu Qinyin arrived.

“How’s she now?” Xu Jinchen asked with anxiety. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“We were chased by five armed men, and a bullet hit Lady Zi’s arm. Luckily, Miss Gu is here, so Lady Zi will be fine,” Mengda said.

“What? Five armed men?” Xu Qinyin was shocked. She wasn’t clear about Zi Beiying’s family background, and thought that it was unbelievable. She didn’t ask further, because she knew that it wasn’t appropriate.

...

Zi Beiying didn’t know that Xu Jinchen would come as well, so she was very nervous upon hearing his voice.

Gu Ning didn’t miss Zi Beiying’s reaction, but said nothing. She knew there was chemistry between them, but it would take time for them to gradually accept each other.

No matter what, it was their own personal affair, and Gu Ning thought that it was better for her to remain silent.

A while later, Gu Ning pushed the car door open and stepped down.

Once she showed up, she was surrounded by her friends. “How’s she now?” they asked her.

“She’s fine, and she’ll fully recover in a few days,” Gu Ning said.

Knowing that, they were relieved. However, Xu Jinchen was still worried because he didn’t see Zi Beiying with his own eyes.

He then moved to look at Zi Beiying with obvious worry in his eyes. “How do you feel now?”

Zi Beiying felt a little uneasy being stared at by him, and her heart was pounding fast. “I’m fine, it wasn’t painful at all because of Gu Ning’s medicine.”

Because of the power crystal, Zi Beiying’s face wasn’t pale anymore and went back to normal.

“Great.” Xu Jinchen relaxed, then he said to Leng Shaoting, “Shaoting, why don’t we send them back to the hotel together?”
