921 Declare Guilty Without Investigation

It was a policewoman who was around 27 years old and she looked unkind.

A touch of jealousy flashed by the policewoman’s eyes when she noticed Gu Ning’s unusual beauty and the handsome man by her side.

Hearing that it was a homicide, passers-by surrounded them at once, and glared at Gu Ning. They believed that Gu Ning was the killer because of what the policewoman had just said.

Policeman Zhao was displeased. “Policewoman Zhang, we haven’t done a thorough investigation yet. Don’t jump to conclusions.”

It seemed like Policeman Zhao was an upright man.

“Policeman Zhao, it couldn’t be more obvious that they killed Miss Jin. If you don’t close this case as soon as we can, it’ll cause us more trouble,” Policewoman Zhang said airily. She didn’t care whether Gu Ning was innocent. All she wanted to do was to settle this case as soon as possible. She had no sense of justice.

From the surveillance cameras, no one would doubt her assumption. As for the motivation, it was easy for someone who wanted to harm you to make up one.

Gu Ning and the others were mad when Policewoman Zhang said that. Leng Shaoting wanted to defend themselves, but Gu Ning stopped him and stood out.

“Well,” Gu Ning sneered, “do you mean that there is no need to investigate it, and do you want to directly announce that we’re guilty?”

“Miss, please don’t get us wrong.”

Before Policewoman Zhang could say something, Policeman Zhao interrupted them. He was unwilling to let Policewoman Zhang damage the police’s reputation.

Gu Ning, however, refused to retreat. “Don’t get you wrong? Policeman Zhao, we’re not idiots, and are able to understand Policewoman Zhang very well. She simply wants to settle this case as soon as possible because of the dead girl’s identity. Why don’t you spend some time searching for the real killer? Aren’t you a public servant, Policewoman Zhang?”

“You...” Policewoman Zhang panicked and felt embarrassed.

Many onlookers were also mad after hearing Gu Ning’s argument.

“How could they do that?”

“They must do the investigation first!”

“They’re public servants and they should serve the public.”

“I don’t think that I’d have the courage to call the police in the future when I need their help.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Facing their criticisms, Policewoman Zhang was furious.

Policeman Zhao didn’t want any citizens to have a bad impression of the police, but the situation was out of control now. In fact, he also hoped that Policewoman Zhang could learn a lesson from it.

He never liked her, because she always made decisions without discussing with other colleagues. She believed that she could do everything she wanted just because she was the sergeant’s niece.

Policewoman Zhang argued. “Do you have any proof to prove that you’re not guilty? Is there any witnesses?”

Hearing that, Gu Ning wore a sarcastic smile. “Isn’t it your duty to collect evidence?”

“Since you’ve checked the surveillance cameras and said that only we were there, how could I find anyone else to be a witness? You didn’t see us kill at all. How could you know that we’re guilty of it? You’ve done no investigation at all, so you can’t declare us guilty.”

Gu Ning looked a little aggressive.

The police indeed hadn’t done any investigation yet. The person who found the dead girl had a relationship with the police station, so nobody thought that he was guilty.

Therefore, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting, who finally appeared at the crime scene, became killers in Policewoman Zhang’s eyes.

Only Policewoman Zhang claimed them to be guilty, while the others just wanted Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting to assist them with the investigation.

Gu Ning added, “We had been there, so it’s understandable that you’re suspicious of us. We’re willing to assist you in the investigation, but don’t announce that we’re guilty before the final result is out. We’re common citizens, but that doesn’t mean that we don’t have the right to sue you for damaging our reputation.”

“You...” Policewoman Zhang didn’t know how to retort.

“Policewoman Zhang, I’m responsible for this case. If you want to take it over, please report it to the sergeant and shut me out of it,” Policeman Zhao interrupted them again at this moment.

Policewoman Zhang didn’t have many skills, but liked to be noticed. What she was doing now was useless.

“You...” Policewoman Zhang was annoyed, but didn’t dare to say another word. Although she was very arrogant because her uncle was the sergeant, she was afraid of her uncle as well.
