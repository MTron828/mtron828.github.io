Chapter 2244: Go Chase Him If You Want to

A lot of things could happen within a few months. Perhaps Gu Ning broke up with her boyfriend and fell in love with another man, then got engaged.

It was hard to explain a romantic relationship clearly, and love actually had nothing to do with timing.

Although Gu Ning came with a new man who wasn’t as handsome as the last one, the two men had the same air.

Ye Jiasheng couldn’t gossip more about Gu Ning’s personal affairs, so he politely greeted Leng Shaoting. “Nice to see you, Mr. Wei.”

“Nice to see you, Mr. Ye,” said Leng Shaoting.

“Miss Tang, Mr. Wei, I’m sorry, my father is occupied today, so I’ll be the host. We can have a meal first at the hotel, and my father will come to see you tomorrow morning,” said Ye Jiasheng apologetically. Ye Chaoxiong didn’t put on airs and wasn’t absent on purpose, he was really occupied.

This gambling competition was held by Ye Chaoxiong, so many people were attracted, including his close friends, so he had to treat them in person.

Gu Ning understood, so she didn’t mind at all. “I know. Let’s go to the hotel now.”

After that, they got in a car and left together.

At the hotel, Ye Jiasheng didn’t leave until Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting finished the meal. He told them to call him whenever they had any needs.

Because it was still early, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t want to stay in the hotel all the time, so they went out to have a walk.

Unfortunately, once they were out, they encountered trouble.

In the hall, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting ran into Ji Manlin who had chased Ye Jiasheng for a long time but was attracted to Leng Shaoting later when Leng Shaoting showed up.

Ji Manlin’s friends came here today, so she booked a room for her friends at the Ye family’s hotel. She booked the room earlier on, or there wouldn’t be rooms available right now.

Ji Manlin remembered Gu Ning, so she was unhappy to see Gu Ning. However, when she remembered the man by Gu Ning’s side, she became excited. She thought she could see that man again, and quickly turned to see the person next to Gu Ning. Sadly, it wasn’t the man she wanted to see next to Gu Ning.

In an instant, Ji Manlin showed obvious disappointment, but after thinking it over twice, she felt it might not be a bad thing. It was possible that Tang Aining broke up with that man and had a new man by her side. If that was the case, it was what she wanted.

Although she had been scared by Leng Shaoting before, she couldn’t forget him. He was so handsome and charming after all. However, she thought it was impossible for them to be together, so she started to chase Ye Jiasheng again.

Ye Jiasheng still ignored her as always, but even if Ye Jiasheng ignored her, Ji Manlin wouldn’t give up. At least she wouldn’t give him up before she met a man who was better than him, or Ye Jiasheng got married and it was over.

If Ye Jiasheng only had a girlfriend, she wouldn’t hesitate to separate them.

Now Tang Aining wasn’t with that man and Ji Manlin wanted to know more about that man, so she let go of her bias and hatred for Tang Aining temporarily and walked to them.

“Hi, Miss Tang, is this gentleman your boyfriend?” Ji Manlin asked politely, because she was afraid that Tang Aining would refuse to talk to her if she had a bad attitude.

Although Ji Manlin felt this new man next to Tang Aining was good-looking too, she still felt that Leng Shaoting was more handsome than all the other men in the world. As a result, she had no interest in this new good-looking man.

Gu Ning understood what Ji Manlin was thinking, but she didn’t bother to be mad at her. Instead, she was up to some mischief. “Yes!”

“How about that man who came to City Ao with you last time?” Ji Manlin asked in a hurry. She couldn’t wait to know more about that man.

“No idea,” said Gu Ning.

“What? No idea? How is it possible?” Ji Manlin exclaimed. She couldn’t stay calm any longer when Gu Ning gave her that answer. She didn’t think Gu Ning was being honest. She felt Gu Ning simply refused to tell her.

Ji Manlin’s exclamation attracted a lot of attention from people around them, but Ji Manlin didn’t seem embarrassed at all.

“How could I know? I’ve already cut off my relationship with him. I have a new fiancé now,” said Gu Ning and rolled her eyes.

Ji Manlin nodded and asked again, “Can you tell me his phone number?”

“He has a new number and isn’t using his old number any longer. And I don’t know his new number,” said Gu Ning.

“Liar!” Ji Manlin didn’t believe it.

“Believe it or not,” said Gu Ning.

“You…” Ji Manlin was furious, but curbed her anger. “Can you tell me his old number? Even if he isn’t using it, I still want to know.”

She refused to believe that Leng Shaoting had really changed his phone number. Even if he had, she would still try to call him and make sure of it.

“Why should I tell you?” Gu Ning asked.

“I know you’re lying to my face! He didn’t change his number,” said Ji Manlin angrily. Then she criticized Gu Ning and pointed at her. “Since you’re no longer in a romantic relationship with him, why are you still stopping me from chasing him? It’s unreasonable!”

“I won’t stop you. Go chase him if you want to. It’s none of my business.” Gu Ning felt amused by Ji Manlin’s words. Did she stop her? She just didn’t tell her Leng Shaoting’s number. It meant nothing!

“If you don’t tell me his number, how can I go chase him? I don’t know where he is,” said Ji Manlin in anger and took it for granted, as if it was Gu Ning’s duty to tell her that man’s number.

“You don’t even know who he is. Why do you still want to chase him? Don’t you have any principles?” Gu Ning shook her head. Ji Manlin didn’t have any dignity.

“It has nothing to do with you!” Ji Manlin was ablaze in fury.

Onlookers figured out what had happened right now, and began to disdain Ji Manlin. How come she planned to chase a strange man? It was ridiculous!

“It has nothing to do with me, so stop asking me about him, alright?” Gu Ning said, then walked away with Leng Shaoting, leaving Ji Manlin behind. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

She felt she might be affected by Ji Manlin if she continued to argue with her. Ji Manlin had a totally different mind from normal people.
