3114 I’ll Spoil You

However, two of them were unhappy about that, because An Chenmeng was distracted by Leng Xiaoyao and always left them behind to see her. They felt that Leng Xiaoyao stole An Chenmeng away, so they had a bad impression of her.

They admired Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities, but they were also jealous of her.

Some relationships didn’t allow outsiders to join. They had been friends with An Chenmeng for a long time, so they believed that they should be closer.

Therefore, after An Chenmeng left them for Leng Xiaoyao, one girl complained. “Boss always leaves us for Leng Xiaoyao these days. She ignores us.”

“Right!” Another girl chimed in.

“This is our boss’s matter. She can do whatever she wants. That’s her right. Don’t interfere,” Lin Xiaoxiao said.

Lin Xiaoxiao was the first girl who became An Chenmeng’s lackey and she was the most loyal to An Chenmeng. She wouldn’t interfere in An Chenmeng’s personal affairs and was the most clear-headed one among them.

“But we’re supposed to be closest to our boss! We’ve been friends for so long. How could Leng Xiaoyao steal our boss away?” The girl argued.

“Steal? Chenmeng doesn’t belong to you. How is it possible that Leng Xiaoyao stole her away from you? Do you want to interfere in Chenmeng’s personal affairs? If you dislike Leng Xiaoyao, you can make things difficult for her if you dare!” Lin Xiaoxiao said.

They could make things difficult for Leng Xiaoyao? That was ridiculous. Did they have the ability to do that? Of course not.

…

Xiong Manxin and the other girls followed Leng Xiaoyao. Although An Chenmeng wanted to buy her a meal today, Xiong Manxin and the other girls also needed to have a meal at the canteen, so they went there together.

An Chenmeng was considerate, so she understood that she needed to be friends with Xiong Manxin and the others too. Since they were together today, she decided to buy them a meal too. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Since we’re all here today, let me buy you all a meal. You can order whatever you want to eat later. Don’t hesitate to order your favorites,” An Chenmeng said.

Xiong Manxin and the other girls didn’t know that An Chenmeng was going to buy Leng Xiaoyao a meal. They had no idea that An Chenmeng was close to Leng Xiaoyao now. Therefore, they were surprised when An Chenmeng said that. Subconsciously, they turned to look at Leng Xiaoyao and asked her silently. What was going on here?

“Since Chenmeng wants to buy us a meal, we can order our favorites later,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She could see that An Chenmeng was willing to do that, so she accepted it.

“Boss, what happened?” Wu Minmin asked confusedly.

“I joined you and I’m one of you now,” An Chenmeng said. She immediately explained her relationship with Leng Xiaoyao.

The other girls turned to look at Leng Xiaoyao again. Because Leng Xiaoyao didn’t oppose it, they believed An Chenmeng’s words.

Xiong Manxin and other girls didn’t feel unhappy about that, but they decided to make An Chenmeng pay a lot for a nice meal. After all, An Chenmeng had caused them losses before!

“If so, we won’t hesitate to order our favorites,” Xiong Manxin said.

“No problem,” An Chenmeng replied. Anyway, they couldn’t eat that much.

“But I don’t like the dishes in the canteen. Why don’t we have a casual meal today and you can buy us a good meal this Saturday? We can go sing and have fun and do a formal initiation ceremony,” Xiong Manxin suggested. Leng Xiaoyao didn’t miss the calculating look that flashed in her eyes.

Even if she couldn’t see Xiong Manxin’s scheme, Xiong Manxin’s words implied everything.

However, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t point it out. Instead, she agreed with Xiong Manxin.

After all, they had suffered losses from An Chenmeng before. It was very tolerant of them that they didn’t harbor grudges against her. As a result, it was still acceptable that they wanted to cost An Chenmeng a bit of money. By doing that, they could get along with each other harmoniously in the future.

When Xiong Manxin said that, An Chenmeng didn’t think it was a big deal, instead she felt that Leng Xiaoyao accepted her. Accordingly, she agreed with alacrity. “No problem. We can gather again this Saturday for a good meal and karaoke. You can choose the place.”

An Chenmeng was very generous and wasn’t worried that it might cose her a lot of money. Anyway, she had invited Lin Xiaoxiao and the other girls for meals and karaoke many times before. It was nothing in her eyes as long as they enjoyed themselves.

Xiong Manxin also suggested that because she knew it was no big deal for An Chenmeng.

If An Chenmeng was short of money, she wouldn’t ask for that.

When Leng Xiaoyao and the others arrived at the canteen, they saw Xing Yuanyang, who gave up on chasing Leng Xiaoyao, and his friends.

Upon seeing Leng Xiaoyao, Xing Yuanyang and his friends walked over. He had heard that Leng Xiaoyao put out a fire and rescued people from it, so he admired Leng Xiaoyao more than ever. She even became his idol and he wanted her to be his boss.

However, it would be embarrassing if he, a strong man and a well-known bully in their school, took a girl as his boss.

If it was possible, he hoped that Leng Xiaoyao could be his girlfriend. In that case, he would be proud.

Although he gave up after being scared by Leng Xiaoyao, he still wanted to try when he saw Leng Xiaoyao again.

Both Leng Xiaoyao and An Chenmeng were famous in their school, so they attracted a lot of attention wherever they went.

Now another famous student, Xing Yuanyang, walked over, so they immediately attracted even more attention.

Being the focus of everyone’s attention, Xing Yuanyang didn’t feel embarrassed at all. In front of Leng Xiaoyao, he asked straightforwardly, “Leng Xiaoyao, do you really not want to be my girlfriend? I’ll spoil you.”

Before Leng Xiaoyao could say anything, An Chenmeng opened her mouth first. “Who do you think you are? How dare you chase Leng Xiaoyao. Why don’t you look at yourself in the mirror first?”

She had seen Leng Xiaoyao with make-up, and she thought Leng Xiaoyao was so beautiful that she deserved a better man than Xing Yuanyang.

Xing Yuanyang was handsome and was born in a rich family, but she still felt he didn’t deserve Leng Xiaoyao at all.

An Chenmeng didn’t criticize Xing Yuanyang on purpose, but Leng Xiaoyao was indeed too outstanding. Ordinary men didn’t deserve her.
