Chapter 2028: Find the Murderer

Therefore, Yin Shiyi immediately stood up and walked to the next table. “Excuse me, can I see the news?” he said.

People sitting around the table didn’t know what he wanted to do, but one of them still gave Yin Shiyi his phone and let him read the news.

Dongfang Jinghong was confused about Yin Shiyi’s behavior, but he just watched.

Yin Shiyi took the phone and saw the picture of the piece of Hotan jade carved with a dragon on the screen. After a glance, he was very sure that it was Yin Shixun’s jade pendant. In an instant, he looked panicked.

Was Yin Shixun really dead?

He couldn’t believe it.

Yin Shiyi refused to believe it because Yin Shixun was a cultivator. It was impossible for mortals to hurt him.

He didn’t think Yin Shixun was killed by another cultivator because there was a rule that cultivators couldn’t kill each other. If there was any conflict, they should report it to Tiandaozong. Tiandaozong would deal with it and wouldn’t hesitate to kill if it was necessary. However, if any cultivator dared to do that secretly, he or she would be punished once it was exposed.

Tiandaozong was the authority in the cultivation world, so no cultivators dared to act against it.

If Yin Shixun wasn’t killed by another cultivator from the cultivation world, then it must be a member of the Evil Practice or a high level monster.

Yin Shiyi slid a finger up the screen to see whether there was a picture of the body to make sure of it.

He actually had a faint hope that it might not be Yin Shixun, but he was heavily hit the moment he saw a picture of the body. His face went pale in an instant and he could barely stand steadily.

The body was really Yin Shixun. To his astonishment, Yin Shixun was killed.

Seeing Yin Shiyi’s reaction, Dongfang Jinghong squinted. It was obvious that Yin Shiyi knew the dead person.

Thinking of the question Yin Shiyi just asked him, he thought the dead person could be Yin Shixun.

Dongfang Jinghong was scared and couldn’t believe it either.

Yin Shiyi was at a high level, so he actually didn’t have many matches in the cultivation world, let alone in the mortals’ world.

If the dead person was really Yin Shiyi, then who killed him?

“Do you know this dead man?” asked the person who gave Yin Shiyi his phone.

Hearing that, Yin Shiyi came back to his senses and returned the phone to the person. He didn’t answer the person’s question and only thanked him before turning around and walking away.

The person didn’t continue to ask him, because the answer couldn’t be more obvious given his reaction. He must know the dead man.

Yin Shiyi lost his appetite. He had to take Yin Shixun’s body, then go back to the cultivation world and talk about it with the Yin family.

After Yin Shiyi went back to the table, he said, “Nephew Jinghong, I’m sorry, something came up. I have to go. Enjoy it! I’ll go to settle the bill.”

“Please allow me to do that. You can go now if you need to deal with something. Don’t waste time here,” said Dongfang Jinghong. He was very considerate. It wasn’t a big deal that he bought a meal for Yin Shiyi. Yin Shiyi didn’t eat much anyway.

As for what had just happened, Dongfang Jinghong didn’t ask about it. He would know once he read the news on the Internet by himself.

“Thanks, Nephew Jinghong.” Since Dongfang Jinghong said that, Yin Shiyi didn’t insist.

“You’re welcome,” said Dongfang Jinghong, then Yin Shiyi left in a hurry.

Once Yin Shiyi was gone, Dongfang Jinghong took out his phone to search for the news.

Within seconds, he found it. After a glance at the dead body, he recognized it was Yin Shixun.

Although he already had that guess, he was still amazed after making sure of it.

Without delay, Yin Shiyi left for the Public Security Bureau to confirm the body’s identity.

After confirmation, Yin Shiyi successfully took Yin Shixun’s body back, then he quickly left to the cultivation world.

The moment Yin Shiyi saw Yin Shixun’s body, he figured out how Yin Shixun died. He died because someone exploded his energy center.

It seemed that Yin Shixun had encountered a strong match.

Yin Shiyi brought Yin Shixun’s body back to the Yin family in the cultivation world. When the Yin family saw his body, none of them could believe it. Yin Shixun’s parents almost fainted from grief, so did his wife and daughter.

“What happened?” The Yin family’s patriarch asked Yin Shiyi.

The Yin family’s patriarch was its eldest son, and he cared a lot about Yin Shixun who was his nephew because Yin Shixun was outstanding among the young generation.

“He died because his energy center exploded, and he’s been dead for a while. I coincidentally heard the news about a dead man during a meal today. Then I found out it was Shixun.” Yin Shiyi said, “It must be another cultivator who was able to make Shixun’s energy center explode, but I don’t know whether the cultivator is in the cultivation world or the Evil Practice. It can be a monster as well.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He and Yin Shixun weren’t very close, but they got along well with each other, so he felt sad when Yin Shixun was dead.

“Find the murderer!” The Yin family’s patriarch gave an order in anger because it was a humiliation to the Yin family.

The Yin family’s patriarch was suspicious of other powerful families at first, but didn’t think it was very likely. In that case, the murderer was likely to be a member of the Evil Practice or a monster at a high level.

No matter what, they needed evidence now. After that, the Yin family sent out people to investigate it.

Although the police found nothing yet, it didn’t mean they weren’t capable.

Early the next morning, the Yin family’s patriarch went to Tiandaozong and reported to it. Tiandaozong undoubtedly would help the Yin family with it.

Right after the Yin family went to Tiandaozong, the news that Yin Shixun was killed went abroad. All the powerful families learned the news and discussed who did it.

They knew that the Yin family might be suspicious of them, but they didn’t do it, so they weren’t worried about the investigation.

Jing Jining, however, felt nervous and anxious because Yin Shixun’s death had something to do with him.

He knew Tiandaozong’s abilities very well. They certainly would find out about his involvement in Yin Shixun’s death, but he and Gu Ning were in a remote mountain when they killed Yin Shixun. Therefore, they had no evidence to prove that he was the murderer even if they discovered that he had contacted Yin Shixun.

After all, he wasn’t as skilled as Yin Shixun, which was generally known to everyone.

Nevertheless, he was afraid that they might find out about Jing Yunyao through him, so he left the cultivation world as soon as he heard the news and called Jing Yunyao.

He knew that Jing Yunyao went to Kunlun Mountain, but he still tried to get through to her. Perhaps they were already back!

After he failed to get through to her, Jing Jining sent Jing Yunyao a message telling her that the cultivation world found out about Yin Shixun’s death and Tiandaozong was carrying out an investigation. Once Jing Yunyao’s phone could receive signals, she would be able to read the message. For now, he could only do his best to ruin the surveillance videos of his meetings with Jing Yunyao.
