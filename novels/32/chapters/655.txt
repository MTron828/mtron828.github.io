Chapter 657 Who Are They?

Cao Wenxin joked, “Ningning, you’re so charming that even girls doubt their sexual orientation once you appear.”

Gu Ning wore a resigned smile, but she finally understood the feelings of a popular star. Although she wasn’t a star herself, she had become the hottest topic many times like a star!

The video was uploaded to the Internet after a short time, and it threw a bomb among countless Internet users again without doubt. A person in the spotlight was liable to be attacked, so many people criticized Gu Ning although the majority was supportive.

“It’s a good thing to save others’ lives, but is it necessary to post it on the Internet every time? I wonder whether it’s a publicity stunt.”

“Goddess Gu doesn’t need a publicity stunt. She isn’t a star, and the video was uploaded by a passer-by.”

“Exactly! It’s not Goddess Gu’s fault.”

“Haters, are you just being jealous?”

Once someone criticized Gu Ning, Gu Ning’s loyal fans would attack him or her.

“No matter whether it’s a publicity stunt or not, I think she should stop consuming our attention.”

“Don’t pay attention to it if you dislike it!”

“Agree!”

“Although she isn’t a star now, she can make her debut at any moment.”

“If Goddess Gu wants to be a star, I think she’s qualified. In addition, don’t you know Goddess Gu already has over a hundred million yuan in wealth?”

“Goddess Gu doesn’t lack money at all!”

Afterwards, many Internet users began to discuss Jade Beauty Jewelry.

“I heard the Jade Beauty Jewelry will hold sweepstakes tomorrow, and the prize is a jade pendant which is worth over a hundred thousand yuan! Who is going with me?”

“I’ll go with you!”

“Me too!”

“I won’t miss it either!”

The Jade Beauty Jewelry was indeed going to hold sweepstakes tomorrow at its opening ceremony, and there would be ten people who could win the prize of the jade pendant. Gu Ning was really a generous boss!

In fact, it was all because those pieces of jade didn’t cost her much. If she was a normal jewelry businessmen, she obviously wouldn’t be willing to set a prize at such a high price.

The jade pendant was priced over a hundred thousand yuan in ordinary people’s eyes, but it valued no higher than a stone for Gu Ning. Even so, only ten people could win the prize, which wasn’t easy.

Besides, the sweepstakes was open to all comers, while the prize was so expensive, so many people would love to join it. Probably over hundreds or even thousands of people would take part in the activity.

Other than the 10 big prizes, there were another 50 small prizes too.

Some people who didn’t live in City B felt that it was quite a shame that they couldn’t participate in the activity, because it cost a lot of money and time to fly to City B. Even so, a few people who were fans of Gu Ning and Su Tongnuo still made up their mind to join in the activity, because both Su Tongnuo and Gu Ning would appear at the ceremony.

Su Tongnuo was a star after all, so she had many loyal fans.

In Charm, there were many customers who were attracted by the ad.

Moreover, there were less than 50 sets of gowns in the store now, which meant that Charm had sold out over half of its gowns within just three days!

As for the rest of the gowns in the store, people didn’t choose them because they didn’t fit them well, and they ordered customized gowns.

“Wow, the men are so handsome!”

Once Gu Ning and the others walked near, some women exclaimed in great surprise.

Hearing that, silence fell on the store all of a sudden, and everyone turned to look at the group who just walked inside. However, almost everyone ignored Cao Wenxin and Gu Ning, but focused on Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei.

were

The majority of the customers in the store were women, and there were only a few men, so Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei became their focus.

“Wow, the men are so handsome!”

“Who are they? Are they stars?”

“No way! Celebrities would never show up here!”

“Right, what a shame that they aren’t actors!”

“Exactly!”

All the women couldn’t stop talking about them.

The reason why they thought that Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei could be stars was because the entertainment industry consisted of good-looking people.

Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei were already used to it, but they disliked it, especially Leng Shaoting. However, they remained quiet.

Women exclaimed in surprise when they saw handsome men, but they also felt jealous if there were beautiful girls beside them. Therefore, many women looked at Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin with jealousy.

Facing that, Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin didn’t mind at all.

“Hi!” Yu Zi walked to them with a broad smile at once, and felt a little embarrassed at the customers’ reaction.

Since there were many customers in the store, Yu Zi didn’t know whether she should call Gu Ning her boss or not, so she gave up.

“Hi! I come here to have a look. Have you prepared the gowns?” Gu Ning asked.

“Yes, of course,” Yu Zi said. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Please give the gowns to me, and I’ll store them in the hotel,” Gu Ning said. In fact, she planned to sit for a while in the store, but gave up seeing as there were so many people inside.

“Sure, please wait a second,” Yu Zi said, then went to take out gowns from the storeroom.

Every set of gown was well and separately packed, and there were ten of them in all.

Leng Shaoting and Xin Bei didn’t hesitate to carry the 10 boxes. They were well-trained soldiers anyway, so it was just a piece of cake for them.

After taking the gowns, Gu Ning and the others left.

“Who are they?” Once they were gone, someone asked Yu Zi.
