3189 Seek Chances to Be Close to Mu Yiyang

Thank you readers!

Instead, he believed that his daughter could try to find out more about Mu Yiyang if she had interest in him.

The young woman immediately came back to her senses. Because her father pointed out the truth, she flushed in an instant. “Dad, don’t be ridiculous!”

“I’m not. You can barely take your eyes off of him.” Her father joked.

“Dad!” The young woman seemed a little mad and lowered her head in embarrassment. She didn’t know what to say, but her response proved everything.

“It’s not a big thing if you like him. Why didn’t you admit it? After the auction, we can turn to your Uncle Fan for help,” her father said. “Brother Fan, can you help my daughter introduce herself to Mr. Mu later?” He said to Fan Yaofeng next to him.

Upon hearing that, Fan Yaofeng looked unhappy.

Fan Yaofeng didn’t care about the face and directly said, “I can’t do that. Mr. Mu is different from those rich heirs you usually see. He’s aloof. Many rich ladies have tried to strike up a conversation with him, but were all coldly rejected. I have only met him twice. We’re not familiar at all. It’s my honor that he still remembers me, but it won’t do me any good if he gets mad at me if I help you.”

Fan Yaofeng complained to himself that they had no clear acknowledgment of themselves. It wasn’t strange that they were attracted to Mu Yiyang, but Mu Yiyang was totally out of their league.

Even if the man had status in City Yun, he was a nobody in the capital city.

Therefore, Fan Yaofeng believed that it was impossible for Mu Yiyang to be interested in them.

Even if Mu Yiyang had interest in his daughter, the Mu family wouldn’t accept her because rich families preferred a marriage between families of equal social status.

It was very rare for a super rich family to accept someone from a much poorer family.

Originally, the young woman was pleased to hear that her father wanted Fan Yaofeng to help her introduce herself to Mu Yiyang. Therefore, she was greatly disappointed after hearing Fan Yaofeng’s reply.

Her father was also displeased, but he said nothing.

At the same time, Si Yiqi joked about Mu Yiyang. “Well, well, Yiyang, I think she’s interested in you.”

“There are too many women who are interested in me, but I have no interest in them,” Mu Yiyang said proudly, but it was the truth.

In fact, he stayed in the military most of the time. He barely had private time, so he actually didn’t have many chances to meet women. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

His admirers were those women who struck up a conversation with every man at parties. They easily fell in love with a man as long as the man reached their standards.

“What’s your type?” asked Si Yiqi.

“I’ll know it when I see her,” Mu Yiyang said.

“Actually, I’m most curious about Mochen’s type. What kind of girls can make Mochen fall in love?” Si Yiqi said. As he said that, he glanced at Leng Xiaoyao, then at Li Mochen. Obviously, he had an intention by saying that.

Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen noticed Si Yiqi’s glances, so they understood what Si Yiqi was thinking.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care and said nothing, but Li Mochen gave him a cold glance. “It has nothing to do with you. Mind your own business.”

“I’m just a little curious.” Si Yiqi argued.

“Like Mr. Mu said, you’ll know when you meet her. Even if you’re curious about it, you can’t know right now,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Si Yiqi was struck dumb by Leng Xiaoyao’s words and didn’t know what to say.

The twelve complete raw jade materials and nine half-cut raw jade materials that Leng Xiaoyao paid special attention to were all bought by her and her friends.

Li Mochen bought a complete raw jade material and a half-cut raw jade material. Both of them had strong magical power.

Si Yiqi and Mu Yiyang had gotten a complete raw jade material with a little magical power and a half-cut raw jade material with strong magical power, and Jiang Han and Mu Fan had gotten two complete raw jade materials with a little magical power.

Leng Xiaoyao also bought five complete raw jade materials and six half-cut raw jade materials with strong magical power. She got many raw jade materials of high quality today!

After the auction, they went to pay their bills.

Because the young woman was unwilling to see Mu Yiyang leave like that, she bought a raw jade material too in order to meet him again at the counter.

When the young woman bid for the raw jade material, Leng Xiaoyao and the others understood what she wanted to do, but they couldn’t openly say that she was targeting Mu Yiyang. After all, every guest came for the auction.

Without surprise, Mu Yiyang and the others saw the young woman when they went to deal with the contracts.

They didn’t pay much attention to her, but she came to say hi to Mu Yiyang.

“Hi, Mr. Mu.”

Once she did that, Leng Xiaoyao and the others were sure that she bought the raw jade material in order to meet Mu Yiyang closely.

‘What’s wrong?” Mu Yiyang clearly knew that she came to strike up a conversation with him, but he pretended that he knew nothing and asked coldly.

“N -Nothing...” The young woman didn’t know what to do or say when Mu Yiyang was so cold.

“Great.” Mu Yiyang answered, then ignored the young woman. Standing at the side, the young woman was extremely embarrassed. She was in a dilemma.

However, since she had already walked over, she would regret doing that if she didn’t talk to Mu Yiyang for longer. Therefore, she took a deep breath and summoned up her courage to talk to Mu Yiyang again. “Um, Mr. Mu, I know it’s a little abrupt that I came to talk to you, but I have no other intentions. I simply hope that we can be friends. Can you give me your phone number?”

“I’m sorry, I can’t.” Mu Yiyang rejected her without delay.

Hearing that, the young woman was upset and disappointed.

Although she was reluctant to accept the result, her dignity didn’t allow her to continue. Therefore, she said, “Fine, if so, I should go.”

The next moment, she turned around and walked away.

Even when she was gone, Leng Xiaoyao and the others didn’t discuss her , because it was rude..
