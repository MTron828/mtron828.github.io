Chapter 2418: Go Have a Cold Shower

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“What…” Mr. Jin wanted to say something, but they were already gone. He couldn’t go ahead and stand in their way!

His own younger sister was embarrassed in public, so he definitely wouldn’t be in a good mood. He turned to glare at his younger sister, but said nothing to blame her.

They were greatly humiliated now, so they had to leave as soon as possible.

He was aware that the girl wasn’t wrong and that it was his younger sister’s fault. He had no position to criticize Gu Ning.

“Go now!” Mr. Jin snapped at his younger sister, then turned around and walked out. He felt humiliated as the other people looked at his younger sister mockingly. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After they walked out, Mr. Jin angrily shouted at Miss Jin, “What’s wrong with you? Aren’t you afraid that Baili Zongyang will have a bad impression of you? Can’t you behave yourself? You totally lost control when you saw that man. And that man actually has a fiancée, who you were criticized by. It’s very humiliating!”

Miss Jin understood that it was her fault, so she didn’t dare to argue with her older brother, but Leng Shaoting was too handsome!

“Alright, even if this didn’t happen today, I don’t think Baili Zongyang will be interested in your younger sister. I noticed that Baili called you Mr. Jin just now. He clearly doesn’t think you two are close. I think you should change your target,” said the man who came with Mr. Jin at this time. He stood aside and saw it clearly. It couldn’t be more obvious that Baili Zongyang hated them.

However, he didn’t put it frankly. Baili Zongyang was handsome, young and outstanding. He had countless choices! Miss Jin was pretty, but Baili Zongyang was far out of her range.

The man felt that if the Jin family wanted to gain support through Miss Jin’s marriage, they better help her find an older, ugly man, because quality men had no interest in Miss Jin.

Mr. Jin knew that Baili Zongyang deliberately kept a distance from them, but he still wanted to try. However, he lost hope now.

At the same time, Baili Zongyang and the others went to a private room and started ordering.

Because all of them could eat a lot, they ordered many dishes which could cover the whole table.

Jiang Liluo and Si Jin hesitated to order. They didn’t know how to order either, so they left it to Gu Ning.

When they finished ordering, the waiter left. Baili Zongyang apologized to Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. “Lord Leng, Miss Gu, I’m so sorry for what just happened. I hope you’re not too affected.”

Although it wasn’t his fault, it happened because of him. Due to him, they ran into Miss Jin.

“It’s fine. We’ve not been affected. I embarrassed her because I was annoyed,” said Gu Ning. She was displeased with Miss Jin’s behavior, but it wouldn’t affect her mood. She wasn’t that sensitive!

Baili Zongyang understood that it wasn’t serious, but he felt that he should make an apology.

“I hate them too. Mr. Jin and Miss Jin are brother and sister. The Jin family’s company is in trouble these days, and they need money to keep it afloat. So they targeted me last week. They invited me out for a meal, then drugged my drink. They tried to trap me by making Miss Jin have sex with me. The drug is effective on ordinary people, but it doesn’t really work on cultivators,” said Baili Zongyang.

“That’s shameless,” said Gu Ning. She was disgusted by Mr. Jin and Miss Jin’s behavior.

Anyway, she didn’t take it seriously. They were merely strangers.

“It seems that they don’t know that you’ve already found out,” said Si Jin with certainty.

“Yeah, they didn’t know yet. If they knew, they wouldn’t have been so calm at our meeting earlier. They didn’t succeed, so I’m unwilling to argue with them, but I’ll keep my distance from them,” said Baili Zongyang.

“You’re optimistic. If I were you, I would have beaten them,” said Jiang Liluo. He had a quick temper, but he stayed reasonable most of the time. He wouldn’t cause other people trouble, but he wouldn’t hesitate to fight back if anyone dared to mess with him.

“In fact, I almost did that, but I still need to do my own business. So I don’t want to have unnecessary trouble. After all, their drug isn’t useful on cultivators. It can’t be examined either,” said Baili Zongyang. He wasn’t tolerant of everything, but he knew what he shouldn’t do.

…

They had ordered many dishes, but they finished nearly all the food, after which they separated and went home.

Gu Ning, Leng Shaoting, Jiang Liluo and Si Jin returned to the siheyuan. However, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting only stayed there for half an hour, before they left.

There were enough rooms in the siheyuan, but Leng Shaoting wanted to have some private time with Gu Ning.

Back in Mid-levels, Leng Shaoting felt sexually excited, but he was bound to be disappointed when he wanted to have sex with Gu Ning.

“I’m on my period,” said Gu Ning with a meaningful smile.

She didn’t tell Leng Shaoting that until he was burning with desire because she wanted to tease him.

Instantly, Leng Shaoting stiffened and looked upset. He already had an erection, but Gu Ning told him they couldn’t have sex.

Leng Shaoting took a deep breath and said in a hoarse voice, “You can use your hand.”

Gu Ning flushed red at once. Although she had done that before, it didn’t often happen, so she wasn’t used to it.

“Can’t you go have a cold shower?” Gu Ning asked. She regretted teasing Leng Shaoting.

“No,” said Leng Shaoting with determination. He was reluctant to be tortured alone. Why didn’t she tell him earlier? She had to pay for that!

“Really? Can’t you think about it?” Gu Ning watched Leng Shaoting with a pitiful look, trying to win his sympathy.

“No,” said Leng Shaoting in a determined tone. He even threatened her. “If you don’t use your hand, we’ll have sex. I don’t care that you’re on your period.”

“You…” Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second. She knew that Leng Shaoting wouldn’t do that, but she was also aware that she couldn’t escape now.

“Can we turn the light off?” Gu Ning stopped struggling, but still tried to negotiate with him. It was embarrassing with the light on.

“No,” said Leng Shaoting. If the light was off, it would be less enjoyable.

Gu Ning didn’t know what to say and had to accept it.
