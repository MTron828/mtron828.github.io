3303 You’re Not a Gentleman

She had never been a gentle and kind Virgin Mary bi*ch. This woman clearly had hostility towards her, so she wouldn’t sympathize with her.

Moreover, this woman not only had hostility towards her, but also liked Gao Lei!

If Gao Lei also liked this woman, and was willing to accept her, Zhou Jing wouldn’t interfere. She would have no right to interfere either even though Zhou Jing also liked Gao Lei.

Unfortunately, Gao Lei didn’t like this woman!

“Mr. Gao, your words are very ungentlemanly and hurtful!” The female student who was brought by Zhang Yawen couldn’t help standing up for her.

“Why can Ms. Zhang care about me, but I can’t tell Ms. Zhang to care about herself?” Gao Lei wasn’t a thin-skinned person and directly retorted.

The female student was struck dumb for a second and didn’t know how to refute. She naturally knew that Gao Lei was right, but she felt that if Zhang Yawen liked Gao Lei, then Gao Lei should feel moved.

Unfortunately, those who had such thoughts were basically the same kind of people as Zhang Yawen.

Zhou Jing didn’t want to make things too ugly in public. “Alright, you should leave! We can meet after the competition.”

Zhou Jing didn’t mean to deliberately provoke Zhang Yawen by saying that. After all, they had agreed to meet again tomorrow afternoon, and there were other close friends involved too.

However, when Zhang Yawen heard that, she felt that Zhou Jing was deliberately provoking her. It also made her misunderstand that these two might really be a couple.

However, because Gao Lei was present, she didn’t say anything.

“Sure.” Gao Lei responded before leaving.

He didn’t ask Leng Xiaoyao about her plans. Zhou Jing had already told him that Leng Xiaoyao would be staying in the capital city for a few days after the competition.

When Gao Lei asked why, Zhou Jing simply said that it was something the principal had arranged and Leng Xiaoyao had permission from him.

In that case, Gao Lei didn’t ask any more questions.

As soon as Gao Lei left, Zhang Yawen approached Zhou Jing and asked, “Miss, what’s your relationship with Mr. Gao?”

“We’re friends!” Zhou Jing replied perfunctorily.

“What kind of friends are you?” Zhang Yawen asked. She was unwilling to stop until she figured it out.

“Is it any of your business?” Zhou Jing asked. Did Zhang Yawen think that she was easy to take advantage of?

“…” Zhang Yawen was taken aback, feeling as if Zhou Jing deliberately embarrassed her.

She forgot that she embarrassed herself. If she didn’t seek embarrassment, who could embarrass her?

“Ms. Zhou!”

At that moment, a female voice sounded. Many people instinctively looked over.

When their gaze fell on the girl, they were all amazed.

She was incredibly beautiful!

After being amazed, many people showed jealousy, especially the female student standing with Zhang Yawen.

“You’re back.” Zhou Jing saw Leng Xiaoyao and smiled.

“When you said that you were here, I thought you would have gone back to your room!” Leng Xiaoyao said. She said that on purpose because she had already seen what had happened.

“You came back just in time. Let’s go back to the room together!” Zhou Jing said.

“Sure.” Leng Xiaoyao agreed and ignored the others, walking back to their room with Zhou Jing.

Initially, Zhang Yawen didn’t know Zhou Jing’s identity and thought that she was just a hotel guest. She didn’t expect her to be a teacher who brought students to participate in the competition.

“Humph! She looks like a vixen.” Looking at Leng Xiaoyao’s back as she left, the girl next to Zhang Yawen whispered.

Leng Xiaoyao heard it, but didn’t engage with her since the girl didn’t provoke her.

Zhang Yawen didn’t criticize the girl because she also felt the same way. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

People who looked good either attracted people’s favor or jealousy and dislike.

While they were jealous of Leng Xiaoyao, some boys were also interested in her and started discussing her.

“I wonder which province or city the girl is from? She looks so pretty.”

“Why don’t you go ask her?”

“I don’t dare to. What if she ignores me? I’ll just end up embarrassed.”

…

Leng Xiaoyao brought textbooks. Although she had confidence in herself, she never boasted about being unbeatable. There were plenty of top students here, and the champions from various cities across the country were present.

Therefore, after checking into the hotel and freshening up, she began to study.

Zhou Jing didn’t bother her, nor did she try to teach her anything. She was just a Language Y teacher, and didn’t have the ability to teach Leng Xiaoyao much.

She only told Leng Xiaoyao not to hesitate to turn to her for help if she had any questions about Language Y.

There were four municipalities, twenty-two provinces, and countless cities under each province in Seven Star Country. Accordingly, there were a lot of people participating in this competition, probably over a hundred.

Not every city had participants. The top five contestants from the capital city and City Hai were selected to participate in the finals, while two contestants were selected from first-tier cities. Second and third-tier cities directly sent their champions to participate, while fourth-tier and below cities arranged for a certain number of high school students to compete together.

There weren’t many high schools in small cities. It wasn’t appropriate to have only two or three high school students compete for the championship! It wouldn’t be difficult.

Generally, around ten high schools would compete together, then the champion would be selected to participate in the national competition in the capital city.

However, if the champion’s score was too low, they wouldn’t be accepted. They had to reach the designated score.

Otherwise, how could they compete with those who had extremely high scores!

Ninety percent of the contestants in the finals were high school seniors because they had acquired more knowledge compared to high school juniors. High school freshmen wouldn’t participate because they didn’t have enough knowledge.

If a high school junior won, it would be very impressive because the competition covered knowledge from grade nine to twelve.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t stay up too late and went to bed at 11 pm.

She wasn’t afraid of being tired the next day but Zhou Jing was worried that she would be tired, so Zhou Jing asked her to sleep early.

Studying hard now wouldn’t bring much progress because knowledge accumulated over time.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care much about this short review time, so she went to sleep.

…

After sending Leng Xiaoyao to the hotel, Li Mochen sat in the car for a while before leaving. When Leng Xiaoyao got out of the car, she gave him something, a piece of clothing to be exact.

He was excited and happy when he received the gift, so he didn’t refuse it.

It was different from how he would have reacted if it was from other girls.

Li Mochen looked at the cloth with a silly smile for a while before going home. As soon as he got home, he couldn’t wait to try it on.

It fit well and looked good. He didn’t want to take it off.
