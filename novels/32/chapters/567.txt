Chapter 568 Tang Yunfan Is Awake

Gu Ning couldn’t figure out why those people had to abduct Gu Man. Gu Man just came to City B, and she stayed in the Tang family’s house or Gu Ning’s house the entire time. It wasn’t likely that Gu Man had annoyed someone. Or, did Gu Ning ignore something?

Gu Ning wasn’t very clear about the Tang family’s history, so she didn’t know that Gu Man was abducted precisely because of the Tang family.

It was a long, thin road and Leng Shaoting ran for over 10 minutes before he finally found a broad road. Luckily, there were surveillance cameras at the intersection.

Leng Shaoting immediately made a call. “Check the surveillance cameras of a place to see the vehicles which have appeared within two hours. Find the owner of the MPV according to its license plate. I’ll send you my location.” Because Leng Shaohao didn’t know where it was, he sent the mobile location over. After that, he called Gu Ning at once.

“You can wait there, and keep on tracing after you get the answer. I haven’t found any useful information here, so I’ll walk ahead,” Gu Ning said. Leng Shaoting was just investigating, but hadn’t found Gu Man yet, so she couldn’t give up.

“Sure. You have to be careful and call me whenever you find anything useful,” Leng Shaoting said. Although he was worried about Gu Ning’s safety, they had to search for Gu Man in different directions. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I will,” Gu Ning said, then hung up.

She went further ahead in the following hours, and there were no villages around, but Gu Ning had no intention to turn back, and went further and further along the road.

About twenty minutes later, Leng Shaoting received a call. The surveillance cameras of this intersection were destroyed at around six pm and only the surveillance cameras of the roads on both sides of the intersection were still working

Within two hours, a total of 116 vehicles passed through the broad road. The information on the license plate numbers (owner and model) and the exact times the vehicles passed had been sent to his mailbox.

“Continue to track the whereabouts of these vehicles to see whether anything unusual happens,” said Leng Shaoting. Even though he got the information on these vehicles, he didn’t know which one was abnormal.

However, since the surveillance cameras of this intersection were destroyed in the afternoon, there was a possibility of 80% that this was where the kidnappers had passed, or it was just a trick to attract their attention away from the right direction the kidnappers escaped in.

In the process of tracing them, Leng Shaoting sensed that their enemy was very brilliant, so it was possible that they were being trapped. Leng Shaoting called Gu Ning again, but Gu Ning’s phone was busy.

Gu Ning was actually talking to a man who called her using Gu Man’s mobile phone. “You are Gu Ning, right? Come alone to the abandoned warehouse at the western suburb. I’ll tell you the specific address when you arrive there. Remember, you must come alone. If I see anyone following behind you, your mother will be punished!”

“No problem,” Gu Ning said coldly with a serious look on her face. She didn’t threaten the man on the phone, in case he would be annoyed and hurt Gu Man.

After that, Gu Ning immediately clicked the map open on her mobile phone to search for the location of the abandoned warehouse at the western suburb. Coincidentally, Gu Ning was precisely at the western suburb now, but she was still one kilometer away from the abandoned warehouse.

Gu Ning didn’t tell Leng Shaoting that she just received a strange man’s call because the man had warned her to come alone. She was also confident that she could handle it well on her own.

Gu Ning was sure that it was a trick now, because the abandoned warehouse in the western suburb was located in the opposite direction from Leng Shaoting.

She figured out that the man was actually aiming to hurt her after receiving the call. She had made many enemies in business till now, but she didn’t know who did this to her mother. No matter who he or she was, Gu Ning was determined to pay him or her back.

Without hesitation, Gu Ning ran to the abandoned warehouse in the western suburb.

In the Tang family’s house.

Tang Yunfan’s fingers moved a little, and he mumbled with anxiety and fear. “Man, please, please...”

It seemed like Tang Yunfan was regaining his consciousness, and the memory about Gu Man, but no one knew what had happened in his dream that made him so anxious.

All of a sudden, Tang Yunfan’s closed eyes opened and he sat up abruptly. He looked around, but there was nobody in his room, so he got out of his bed and walked out.

In the living hall, the members of the Tang family were gathered, except for Cao Ruihua, his military force, and Cao Wenjun, together with his Criminal Police Force, who were out to search for Gu Man. Tang Yunrong and Cao Wenxin were also here waiting for the information.

“It’s been so long! Could anything bad have happened to Gu Man?” Tang Yunrong was nervous.

“Don’t worry. She’ll be fine,” Jiang Lihua said to comfort her.

“Gu Man just came to City B, and she stayed in our house or Ningning’s house all the time. Why did she suddenly get abducted?” Tang Yunrong couldn’t figure it out.

“What? Man was abducted?”

Right at this moment, a shocked male voice sounded from upstairs, which surprised everyone in the hall. They looked over with one accord then saw Tang Yunfan walking down in a hurry.

“Did you say Man was abducted?” Tang Yunfan asked anxiously when he walked closer to them.

“Yunfan, you’re awake!”

However, Tang Yunfan wasn’t in the mood to care about his condition; all he wanted to know was what had happened to Gu Man.

Tang Yunhang explained it to Tang Yunfan at once. “When the chauffeur drove Gu Man back today, a MVP hit the private car to make it stop, then several men abducted Gu Man and the chauffeur. We’ve sent out many people to search for them, but we haven’t heard any good news yet.”

Hearing that, Tang Yunfan was mad.
