Chapter 1569: The Truth of Leng Shaoting’s Parents’ Death

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

It was said that the shepherds living in Kunlun Mountain would rather let their cattle and sheep starve to death on the Gobi Desert because they had no fat grass to eat than let them enter the lush, ancient and silent deep valley of Kunlun Mountain. Because this valley was the Death Valley, covered with wolf fur, bear bones, hunter’s steel guns, and deserted hills and solitary graves, conveying a terrifying breath of death to the world.

Gu Ning thought that there were probably troublesome ghosts or monsters, which was more reasonable in her opinion. However, scientists believed that it was only due to geomagnetic variation, weather variation, terrain variation and many other factors that caused such a dangerous place to be born.

It wasn’t wrong. The Door to Hell was indeed a place where the weather was fickle, the terrain was rugged and dangerous, with mountains, cliffs, valleys, quagmires, and pools.

Peaks, valleys and water pools were fine, because they could easily be seen, but the quagmire was super dangerous. If one wasn’t careful, it would be difficult for him or her to get out of it once he or she stepped into it.

Therefore, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see what was under the ground along the way to avoid quagmires.

The road got more and more rugged as they went deeper, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting had to leave their car and begin to walk.

Walking wasn’t difficult for them, because they were quite used to walking for a long distance.

After they got out of the car, Gu Ning put it into her telepathic eye space. There was no one else around them, so Gu Ning wasn’t worried at all.

Leng Shaoting was already aware of her telepathic eye space, but he was still surprised when he witnessed it.

It took about half an hour for them to get to their destination on foot, and they needed to refer to their map to make sure that they were on the right way. Unfortunately, they could only know the approximate location from the map instead of the exact cliff. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Although Leng Shaoting had several old photos of the accident scene, over a dozen years had passed and everything was different now.

Even though Gu Ning had a pair of Jade Eyes, they still spent a lot of time searching for the exact cliff. Luckily, they finally found the place where the accident happened that year.

They walked about for a while, but failed to find anything useful, but they didn’t leave right away. Instead, they took out candles and spirit money to pay their tribute to Leng Shaoting’s parents.

“Mr. Leng, Mrs. Leng, I’m your daughter-in-law. Shaoting and I have come to visit you today,” Gu Ning said.

Although Leng Shaoting remained silent, he felt quite sad at this moment.

“Mr. Leng, we found out Mrs. Leng’s real identity, so I’m afraid that she’s still alive, and we...” Gu Ning continued.

However, before she could finish, the flames suddenly went up high, which surprised Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning stopped at once and exchanged a glance with Leng Shaoting. They didn’t understand it, and took it as a coincidence.

“If Shaoting’s mother is really alive, we really want to...” Gu Ning said again, and the flames went up high all of a sudden again.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting realized that it couldn’t be a coincidence. It must be a hint for something.

In order to make sure of it, Leng Shaoting calmed himself down and cleared his throat before he said, “Father, I’m Shaoting. I came to visit you today, and I have the doubt that my mother is still alive. If you can hear me, please help us find her.”

The second Leng Shaoting finished, the flames went up high once more, and strange pictures flashed by in the fire.

In the pictures, a man and a woman in camouflage were fighting against another man in a black robe. Because the pictures were vague, they couldn’t see their faces, and the man in camouflage was forced to jump off the cliff by the man in a black robe.

The woman in camouflage tried to grab him, but the man in a black robe waved his sleeve and dust along with stones on the ground were immediately sent up into the air.

The violent storm spun quickly and attacked the woman with great force.

The woman wasn’t prepared and several stones pierced through her body, then she fell off the cliff in an instant.

At this moment, Gu Ning clearly saw the pair of cruel eyes of the man in a black robe. There was also a big mole under the corner of his right eye, but she still couldn’t see his face.

The next second, two bodies were lying under the cliff. Both of them were in camouflage. The man lay down with his face up, while the woman faced the ground.

After a while, a person came into the picture and replaced the woman in camouflage with another body.

That was the end of the pictures.

Although Gu Ning couldn’t see their faces from the beginning to the end, she was sure that the man and the woman in camouflage must be Leng Shaoting’s parents.

As for the man in a black robe, he couldn’t be simple, because he could easily cause a violent storm with dust and stones by waving his sleeve.

Gu Ning believed that he must be a senior cultivator. She didn’t know whether the man was a member of the Good Practice or the Evil Practice, but she remembered the big mole under his right eye. She was confident that she could recognize him as long as she was able to see him.
