Chapter 330 Skincare Products Made With Gu Ning’s Power

Suddenly, it dawned on Gu Ning that she could use those power crystals to make medicines or skincare products, which would be highly profitable. At the same time, she was able to help ill people, which was good too.

Once Gu Ning made the decision, she would definitely actualize it.

When she opened her eyes again, it was already morning. Gu Ning’s body was fully recovered, but Leng Shaoting still didn’t allow her to get up early and demanded that she sleep for a while longer. He even prepared breakfast and let her eat on the bed. Gu Ning felt like laughing, but obeyed his order. Meanwhile, she kept thinking about her plan of producing medicines and skincare products.

First, she had to build a professional team to produce medicines and skincare products. Then she needed to establish a factory and a company. After that, she could produce medicines and skincare products in the usual or common way but add her power crystals into them secretly to enhance the effect. Therefore, the prescriptions and materials of medicines and skincare products were the same as those of other medicine factories, but the effect was really different. After the medicines and skincare products were produced and certified, they could come onto the market.

Gu Ning decided to sell her medicines and skincare products across the country. As long as her medicine and skincare products were of high quality, there was nothing else to worry about.

However, she didn’t tell Leng Shaoting her plan yet. When Leng Shaoting was not in the bedroom, Gu Ning sent a message to K and asked him to help her investigate whether there were any medical companies barely staying afloat. She wanted to acquire one.

K was surprised by Gu Ning’s enthusiasm towards business. It seemed like she wouldn’t miss any chance to make money. And K of course wouldn’t reject his boss’s order.

Leng Shaoting didn’t allow Gu Ning to get up until he prepared lunch. After lunch, Gu Ning went to the antique street. Since she had bought Xiangyun Antique-store, she definitely had to visit it and meet her staff.

Leng Shaoting went along with Gu Ning.

The moment that they got to the antique street, Gu Ning unconsciously used her Jade Eyes to scan the antiques on the stands along the street. After a while, a bronze dagger with black mist mixed with white mist came into Gu Ning’s sight. Gu Ning understood that the white mist was natural power, but she was confused by the black mist. She walked nearer and sensed a strong Yin on the bronze dagger. Gu Ning guessed that this object was probably evil. Normally, evil objects were dug out from graves, but not every piece of ancient objects carried Yin. It depended on the location of the graves.

And once people had objects with Yin, he or she would be affected by Yin. Yin could cause nightmares, diseases or even death. Gu Ning then looked at the stand owner. He looked pale and lacked energy. His forehead was even slightly dark. Obviously, he was already being affected by the Yin.

A person’s forehead was the most important part of their face, and the condition of their forehead implied the person’s luck or fate. If one’s forehead was smooth and shiny, the person had good luck, but if the person was going through a hard time, his or her forehead would look rough. However, if the forehead turned black or dark, the person would be in great trouble.

The stand owner in front of Gu Ning had obviously been deeply affected by the Yin of the bronze dagger. If he didn’t dump the bronze dagger right now, his life could be in danger. Gu Ning didn’t believe in Yin and Yang before, but now that she saw it with her own eyes, she had to believe it.

“Hi, Miss, these are all real antiques that I just bought from the countryside yesterday!” the stand owner said to Gu Ning, but he sounded weak.

Gu Ning thought for a second, and picked the bronze dagger up. A flow of cold air immediately intruded into her body, Gu Ning felt extremely uncomfortable and used her power to protect her heart at once.

When Gu Ning used her power to protect her heart, the power moved through her body and to the bronze dagger. Shortly, the black mist of the bronze dagger had decreased a lot. Gu Ning then realized that her power could drive Yin away.

Knowing that, Gu Ning continued to put her power through the bronze dagger to drive its Yin away. Although Gu Ning’s power was able to do it, it wasn’t easy. When the Yin was finally driven away, Gu Ning lost a lot of energy and her face turned slightly pale.

“How much is it?” Gu Ning asked.

“Thirty thousand yuan. No bargaining,” the stand owner said.

“No problem.” Gu Ning directly took out thirty thousand yuan and handed it to the stand owner. No matter how much was it, Gu Ning was going to buy it anyway, because it was real. Bronze was an instrument made of bronze alloy[1], created in the Bronze Age of human civilization. From the late Shang Dynasty to the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, the bronze dagger was popular and its craftsmanship was excellent.

The one in Gu Ning’s hands was a bronze dagger with a sheep head made during the Shang Dynasty. It was priceless.

Seeing that Gu Ning bought the dagger without hesitation, the stand owner regretted that he hadn’t sold it at a higher price. What he didn’t know was that Gu Ning had saved his life by buying this dagger.

“Is this everything that you bought from the countryside?” Gu Ning asked. She indeed wanted to buy some real antiques dug out from the earth. She also didn’t want innocent people to get ancient objects with Yin.

“Yes!” the stand owner replied.

“Where are these ancient objects from?” Gu Ning asked again. The bronze dagger was newly dug out from the earth, so it must be from somewhere near the countryside.

“Fengyang Village,” the stand owner answered. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Thanks,” Gu Ning said.

“What’s wrong?” Leng Shaoting thought that Gu Ning must have asked the stand owner so many questions for a reason.

“This bronze dagger is real and it is newly dug out from the earth. Thus I thought that there is an ancient grave around the countryside where the stand owner got these ancient objects,” Gu Ning said, but she didn’t tell Leng Shaoting about the bronze dagger’s Yin.

“Do you want to go there?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“Yes,” Gu Ning replied. Although it was illegal to dig up an ancient grave, it was necessary for her to do so. Otherwise, more innocent people would be hurt.
