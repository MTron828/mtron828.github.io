Chapter 1855: You Won’t Be So Proud Soon

The drama about the unqualified manufacturers also had a deterrent effect, so no one now dared to make fake Kouzi products when they were out of stock.

On the way, students who recognized Gu Ning all looked at her with admiration because they knew she was the owner of Kouzi.

However, right after Gu Ning and her friends walked out of their school, Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue sensed that some people were following them. They exchanged a glance and said nothing.

If they guessed correctly, those people must have something to do with Yuan Shuyan and her friends.

Besides, Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue could feel that they were stronger than the bunch of people hired by Gao Shiyan last time, but they didn’t know how much stronger they were. They hadn’t had a fight yet after all, but neither Gu Ning nor Baili Zongxue bothered to take them seriously.

Given the situation, they wouldn’t let Song Miaoge fight against them alone.

Once Gu Ning found out that some people were following them, she told Song Miaoge. It wasn’t beyond their expectation, so they weren’t surprised.

“Should we go to dine first or solve this problem first?” asked Song Miaoge.

“Let’s solve the problem first. I hate being followed,” said Gu Ning.

“No problem.”

Both Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue agreed, because they disliked being followed as well.

Therefore, they walked to an out-of-the-way place.

The National Imperial Palace Park was only one kilometer away from the Capital University on the right side, so there were fewer people on the road.

Those who followed Gu Ning and her friends didn’t think that they had already noticed them when they walked to a place with fewer people around. Instead, it was exactly what they wanted to see.

Once they saw the right time, they dashed to surround Gu Ning and her friends in the middle.

People around them immediately ran away. No one was willing to help them, because they were all afraid of trouble. It was out of instinct.

Gu Ning and her friends weren’t scared at all and faced those men calmly.

There were six men around 30 years old. They all had an air of cruelty, which meant that their hands had been covered in blood or they had killed people.

Seeing that Gu Ning and her friends were not frightened at all, they weren’t surprised, because they knew that Gu Ning was good at fighting before coming here.

Anyway, they didn’t think a young girl was able to beat them.

Right after Gu Ning met the eyes of the man in front of her for two seconds, a picture flashed by her sight.

In a villa, five men with face masks broke into it. The picture flashed, then it was in the master bedroom of the villa. Two men with face masks held knives and violently stabbed a young couple sleeping on the bed while blood splattered.

The same tragedy happened in the other two bedrooms.

Afterwards, these five men took a lot of stuff out of the villa.

The pictures only flashed for three seconds, and they had face masks. However, since Gu Ning saw those pictures when she met these people, it was obviously related to them.

Given their build, they looked basically the same.

Gu Ning glanced at these men again, then found a man with a scorpion tattoo on his neck. In the pictures that just appeared, there was also a man with the same scorpion tattoo on his neck.

Accordingly, Gu Ning was even more sure that they were the same group.

She had read the news about the family slaughter that happened half a year ago on the Internet. It was a wealthy businessman who was killed, but the police hadn’t found any evidence. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

They were wearing masks when committing the crime and the surveillance cameras inside and outside the villa were also destroyed by them. Although there were other surveillance cameras, they only saw their shadows from a distance, so there was no way to start to deal with the case.

“Are you Gu Ning?” a man coldly asked Gu Ning.

It was always the same opening. They knew who she was, but still had to ask that question.

Gu Ning sneered, “If I say no, will you leave?”

“Of course not, because I know you’re Gu Ning,” said the man.

“Ha-ha, ha-ha.” Hearing his answer, Gu Ning and her friends laughed as if they just heard a joke.

“Since you know I’m Gu Ning, why did you still ask that question? Are you an idiot?” said Gu Ning mockingly.

“You...” The man was mad. “Don’t be proud now. You won’t be so proud soon.”

Saying that, he turned to look at Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue. “Only Gu Ning is our target. If you two don’t want to be in trouble, leave now.”

“Trouble? Do you have the ability to cause us trouble? Stop wasting time on talking. Do it now!” said Song Miaoge with disdain. She alone wasn’t able to defeat them, but Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue were here.

Either of them could beat them within a minute.

Song Miaoge’s words annoyed the man. He put on an evil face. “Great, if so, don’t blame us for being too cruel. Beat them!”

After that, the group of men attacked Gu Ning and her friends at once. They knew that Gu Ning was excellent at fighting, but didn’t know that Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue were good at fighting too, especially Baili Zongxue.

Therefore, they only arranged for two people to catch Song Miaoge and Baili Zongxue, while letting four men fight with Gu Ning.

They arranged for four men to fight with Gu Ning, not because they were afraid of her, but because she was their main target and they couldn’t make any mistakes.

Song Miaoge couldn’t beat so many people alone, but it couldn’t be easier for her to defeat only one man. She wouldn’t beat the man right away, but she had control of the situation the entire time. It didn’t cost her much energy.

Even though she didn’t use her full strength, the man was still shocked by Song Miaoge’s skills. He thought that she was merely a weak girl, but unexpectedly she was so good at fighting.

Baili Zongxue was even stronger than Song Miaoge and quickly beat another man to the ground, which shocked the second man too.

Gu Ning did the same thing. Although these men were aware that Gu Ning was excellent at fighting, they were still amazed by her strength.

Not only them, but onlookers were also amazed. They all thought that they were three weak girls, but they turned out to be so strong.

Before long, the fight was over. Within a minute, all six men were beaten to the ground.

Song Miaoge beat one, Baili Zongxue beat two, while Gu Ning beat three.

“Fine, let’s go!”

Since they failed, they had to leave. Although they were injured, they were still able to walk.
