Chapter 213: Advertise Jade Beauty Jewelry

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Hao Ran read the message from his mother, but he didn’t want to go. However, her mother demanded that he come right away. Otherwise, she would punish him when she got home.

To be honest, Hao Ran was afraid of his mother, because his mother could keep talking by his ears for a long time, which was quite bothersome and Hao Ran couldn’t stand it. In the end, he had to agree.

Around 11:40 am, Gu Ning arrived at the beauty salon. Mrs. Hao and Mrs. Lu had also just finished their facial treatment, waiting in the lounge.

“Ningning, come here.” Gu Man saw Gu Ning first. Gu Ning walked over to Gu Man afterwards.

The minute that Gu Ning walked inside, Mrs. Hao abruptly stood up in astonishment. “It’s you!”

Everybody looked at Mrs. Hao. Does she know Gu Ning?

Seeing Mrs. Hao, Gu Ning was slightly surprised, but still greeted her politely. “Nice to meet you, Mrs. Hao!”

“Don’t call me Mrs. Hao. You can just call me Aunt Gu,” Mrs. Hao had a good impression of Gu Ning in the first place, and now she liked her more after she found out that Gu Ning was Gu Man’s daughter.

“Nice to meet you, Aunt Gu,” Gu Ning said again.

“Gu Lan, do you know Gu Man’s daughter?” Mrs. Lu asked with confusion. Gu Qing and Gu Man were also confused.

“She is the girl who attended Master Qin’s birthday party with Hao Ran and the other boys the other day! She also sent a gift of, wait a second, oh, the glass with deer heads! You told me that the girl had a good air at that time!” Mrs. Hao explained with delight.

“Oh! It was you?” Mrs. Lu was surprised. Gu Ning had impressed her that day.

“Yes, it was me. And nice to meet you too, Madam,” Gu Ning greeted Mrs. Lu.

“Please don’t call me Madam. You can simply call me Aunt Bai,” Mrs. Lu said.

“Nice to meet you, Aunt Bai,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Gu Qing and Gu Man figured out what was going on now. They knew that Gu Ning had attended a birthday party.

“Gu Man told me that her daughter is a senior student in the No. 3 High School. I then called Hao Ran to meet you. Unexpectedly, you’re friends already!” Mrs. Hao said, like they were meant to be close.

“Oh, Hao Ran is almost leaving his school now. I’m curious about his reaction when he sees you!” Mrs. Lu said. Apparently, she had no intention to tell Hao Ran the coincidence beforehand.

Gu Ning had the same idea, so she didn’t tell Hao Ran either.

The group of them went to the hotel after that. Mrs. Hao called Hao Ran and told him its location.

Half an hour later, the dishes were gradually placed on the table. At the same time, Hao Ran arrived. The minute he walked into the private room, he noticed Gu Ning, because Gu Ning was more noticeable among those mature ladies.

He rounded his eyes in great shock. “Boss, why are you here?”

“Boss?”

Everyone was surprised, glancing at Hao Ran and Gu Ning. Why is Hao Ran calling Gu Ning his boss?

Gu Man also recognized Hao Ran when he came in. This boy had visited her in the hospital before, but she didn’t remember his name. Now, Gu Man truly believed in fate!

“Um, well, it’s nothing. I just had a bet with Gu Ning, and I lost, so I call her in that way.” Hao Ran realized that he had said something wrong, so he gave them a perfunctory answer. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

In case they would ask further, Hao Ran immediately turned to Gu Man, and asked, “Nice to meet you, Aunt Gu. Do you remember me?”

Mrs. Hao clearly knew that her son fought a lot in his school, but she only knew that Hao Ran fought with boys. If Mrs. Hao found out that Hao Ran had fought with a girl, and that it had been three versus one, she would punish Hao Ran severely. Even if he hadn’t won, it was shameful.

Mrs. Hao hated people without manners.

“Of course! You visited me when I was in hospital,” Gu Man said smiling.

Hao Ran successfully removed the others’ attention from his bet with Gu Ning.

After greeting Mrs. Lu and Gu Qing, Hao Ran took a seat.

Actually, Hao Ran was indeed a good boy. Except for fighting and being absent from classes, he was a well-educated boy with good manners. Teenagers were always disobedient after all.

“I have always wanted to buy a high-end set of jade jewelry, but there’s only common jade in City F. The jewelry in Yicui Jade-store isn’t bad, but I don’t like its style. And I’m too lazy to fly to a first-tier city,” Mrs. Hao said resignedly.

Hearing that, an idea dawned on Gu Ning. This was a good chance for her to advertise her jade jewelry brand.

“Aunt Hao, there is a jade jewelry store in City G that opened the day before yesterday. It is called Jade Beauty Jewelry, which is a high-end brand. Its jade is all medium-high-level and above. A big King’s Green was open for reservation at its opening ceremony, and it was fully reserved within minutes! The store made at least a hundred million yuan that day. Although the King’s Green is sold out, there are many other rare types of jade, like old-pit glass, Double Happiness, purple violet, the water type, the hibiscus type and so forth. It also provides a customization service. In addition, all the consumers can have a 10% discount during the first three days after its opening ceremony.” Gu Ning said. It was quite persuasive.

“Really?” Mrs. Hao’s and Mrs. Lu’s eyes lit up with excitement.

“Yes! I was been there last weekend. You can also search for it on the Internet. There’s a lot of news about it. Many important figures in City G attended its opening ceremony,” Gu Ning replied.

Mrs. Hao and Mrs. Lu immediately used their phones to search Jade Beauty Jewelry, reading through the news. When they saw the advertisement post, both Mrs. Hao and Mrs. Lu were thrilled. The King’s Green seemed so attractive. It was a pity that they missed the chance to see it in person.

And there were many photos of other jade jewelry. The jewelry made of high level jade was indeed different from cheaper ones. They could even feel its nobility through the screen of their phones.

Gu Qing and Gu Man were curious too, but they knew less about jade, so they searched it for fun.

“The design actually looks simple, but the high level jade is indeed special!” Mrs. Hao said.
