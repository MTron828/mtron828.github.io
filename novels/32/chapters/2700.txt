Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Chang Kairui’s family knew the news would go abroad, because it happened in a public place, but they didn’t expect it to cause a sensation. They thought they could stop Master Chang from finding out.

Therefore, after it went viral, Chang Kairui’s family didn’t know what to do.

Once Master Chang heard about it, he called Chang Kairui.

After a night, Chang Kairui became clear-headed. When he woke up, he was confused about why he was in the hospital and couldn’t remember what had happened last night.

When he learned from his older brother that he had twitched and fallen to the ground due to an overdose of smoking and drugs, Chang Kairui strongly denied and insisted on saying that he had never taken drugs. Although he read the test report, he still firmly denied it.

In that case, his family became suspicious of Chang Kairui’s companions. Although they were close, it was still possible for them to try to trap him. Most importantly, if they weren’t guilty, who would have trapped Chang Kairui into taking drugs.

After Chang Kairui became suspicious of them, he wanted to call them and question them about it, but his older brother stopped him.

They had watched the surveillance video yesterday and his friends did nothing. Therefore, they doubted whether Chang Kairui took drugs on his own.

However, they saw nothing wrong with Chang Kairui’s behavior, so they found it very strange.

They also doubted whether there was something wrong with the cigarette, but they smoked the same cigarettes. If there was anything wrong with it, they would have a problem as well.

Only Chang Kairui’s father was aware of his scheme against Wei Lingfeng’s son, so his father wondered whether Wei Lingfeng had found out about what they had done and ordered someone to pay Chang Kairui back.

In the Chang family, the other members had no idea that Chang Kairui had schemed against Wei Lingfeng’s son.

At that moment, he was on the phone while standing in front of the window. He spotted her running in and gave her not more than a side glance. He quickly moved his gaze towards the outside of the window and continued his serious conversation on the phone. 4

He acted as if picking her up from prison was nothing more than a matter of convenience.

Zhong Nuannuan finally felt relief in her heart when she once again saw this man, who was as tall as a pine tree and as noble as the gods. 9

There was a sudden pain in her heart that flooded into her eyes. If she had not done all she could to keep them under control, her tears would have fallen again.

“Nuannuan, how are you doing? You’ve been in prison for a month. Did anyone bully you? Are you hurt anywhere? Tell mum and I’ll make sure to settle everything for you!” 1

“Nuannuan is my daughter. There is no way that the daughter of Zhong Kuijun would be so weak. Just look at Nuannuan’s healthy face, she is in the pink of health. One look at her and anyone can see how well she is doing! Hahahaha… My girl, the Zhou family has withdrawn their suit against you. You have been pronounced not guilty for murder. Your dad is here to take you out of prison. Are you feeling happy?” 4

Zhong Nuannuan’s sight was suddenly blocked as her father, Zhong Kuijun and mother, Jiang Shuwan, stood in front of her. One of them took her left hand and the other held her right. They were concerned over her as they kept asking about her wellbeing.

In the middle of the room, her older sister, Zhong Qianqian, whom they shared the same father but had different mothers, stood not far from where Chi Yang was. Her body was a little slighted and from where Zhong Nuannuan was standing, it looked as if they were standing side by side. 5Kairui before he could finish a sentence.

“You’re a victim, so just go home and explain it to grandfather,” said Chang Kairui’s older brother.

However, Chang Kairui was still anxious, because his scheme against Wei Lingfeng’s son would be exposed if it was really related to Wei Lingfeng.

Master Chang wouldn’t care whether he had tried to scheme against Wei Lingfeng’s son, but he failed! That wasn’t what his family wanted to see.

Anyway, he had to go home right now.

After Master Chang called Chang Kairui, he immediately called Chang Kairui’s father.

Last night, Chang Kairui’s parents went out and came back late. Master Chang didn’t pay much attention to it, because he thought they were going to deal with something, but now he realized it was due to Chang Kairui.

They secretly dealt with it behind his back! Upon thinking of that, Master Chang was furious.

Many colleagues of Chang Kairui’s parents heard the news, so they asked them whether it was true.

Chang Kairui’s parents denied it and said that he just had an attack of angina pectoris.

Unfortunately, not many people were convinced by their reply, because it wasn’t a secret that rich kids lived a life with wild abandon.

When Chang Kairui’s father saw Master Chang’s call, he was also scared, but he still had to answer it.

“Did you know about the news involving Kairui last night?” asked Master Chang in an affirmative tone. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Yeah, but please give me a chance to explain when I get home. Kairui is just a victim,” said Chang Kairui’s father.

Hearing that, Master Chang’s anger didn’t go away. On the contrary, he became even angrier, but he started to become angry at those who trapped Chang Kairui.

However, before he was clear about what actually happened, he was still unhappy with Chang Kairui.

Gu Ning saw the news about Chang Kairui on the Internet, so she didn’t rush to upload the video evidence. She knew that the Chang family would make a clarification so she decided to hit them after the clarification was released.
