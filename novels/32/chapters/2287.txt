Chapter 2289: Leader Qi, Anything up?

However, even if he felt very relieved after knowing that Gu Ning’s fiancé was Leng Shaoting, he was still reluctant to accept the reality.

He felt Gu Ning wasn’t born in a powerful family and was from a small city. How could she manage to win Leng Shaoting’s heart? Why was it her? Was it just because she was pretty and outstanding? He didn’t think that was important for a major family of power. They actually cared more about a girl’s family background. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

As long as a girl was born in a powerful family, she would be chosen by other major families even if she was a good-for-nothing.

He had chased Gu Ning before, but his family would have stopped them from being together if Gu Ning accepted him.

He knew his family would oppose it, but still decided to chase Gu Ning because he never thought about their future. He simply liked her. He would think about their future after they got together.

Anyway, his affection for Gu Ning wasn’t deep enough yet so he didn’t bother to think about their future. If he really loved Gu Ning, he would try to fight against his family’s disapproval afterwards. As long as he insisted, his family would give in one day.

In fact, given his thoughts, Rong Zechen wasn’t a reliable man. Perhaps he was too young to think about his future.

Rong Zechen still couldn’t understand why Leng Shaoting chose Gu Ning because he didn’t have a full understanding of Gu Ning’s abilities.

Although Gu Ning wasn’t born in a powerful family, her own abilities weren’t worse than those major families of power. Moreover, it was just the beginning, and Gu Ning had great potential.

…

Yuan Yilin always admired Leng Shaoting, because he was the most attractive man in high society.

He was handsome, clever, and impressive. Even though he was a little cold to other people, he was much better than those playboys. Therefore, she actually admired Leng Shaoting from afar, but she didn’t dare to chase him due to their families’ relationship. Even if she chased him, they couldn’t be together. And even if they were together, she would become an enemy of her family.

Given the Yuan family’s ambition, it wouldn’t yield to the Leng family, while the Leng family wouldn’t tolerate the Yuan family just because she married into the Leng family.

As a result, the four major families didn’t have marriage alliances, unless one of them was willing to give in.

It was impossible.

Now, after knowing that Leng Shaoting’s fiancée was Gu Ning, Yuan Yilin grew more jealous of Gu Ning. However, she could do nothing about it. She couldn’t go to attack Gu Ning just because of that. She wasn’t dumb.

She would only dig her own grave if she dared to attack Gu Ning.

After that, Rong Zechen and Yuan Yilin told their families that Gu Ning was Leng Shaoting’s fiancée.

Their families already had a deep impression of Gu Ning because she became very successful at a young age and had expansive connections. However, they still didn’t think that Gu Ning was very important. They just avoided having conflicts with her.

However, now that they learned that she was Leng Shaoting’s fiancée, they were shocked. They had heard that Leng Shaoting already had a fiancée, but they weren’t sure who it was.

Given the Leng family’s status, Leng Shaoting’s wife must be from a family with a high status as well, but to their surprise, it turned out to be Gu Ning.

This girl was really someone. She managed to marry into the Leng family!

Although they weren’t married yet, they would get married sooner or later if nothing bad happened.

…

Qi Tianlin had been paying attention to the news about Gu Ning. Although he didn’t do that himself, he arranged for someone to do it. He would be informed if there was anything new about Gu Ning. Therefore, Qi Tianlin soon heard about Gu Ning’s engagement with Leng Shaoting.

He was aware that Gu Ning already had a fiancé. When he called her last time, it was her fiancé who answered his call.

He had told the man to let Gu Ning call him back after she woke up, but he didn’t receive a call, so he believed that the man didn’t tell Gu Ning about it.

He was busy afterwards, so he gradually forgot that, but to his astonishment, Gu Ning’s fiancé was Leng Shaoting.

Upon thinking of Leng Shaoting, Qi Tianlin was furious because they were bitter enemies.

Although Qi Tianlin hated Leng Shaoting, he was very impressed by Leng Shaoting’s abilities. And now he was jealous of him because he was Gu Ning’s fiancé.

Qi Tianlin was sure that Leng Shaoting was Gu Ning’s fiancé, but he still gave Gu Ning a call. He hoped to hear a negative answer from her mouth.

At this time, it was late and was about 11 pm, so Gu Ning was already in her room.

“Leader Qi, anything up?” Gu Ning asked.

“Is Leng Shaoting your fiancé?” Qi Tianlin asked straightforwardly, but it sounded as if he was questioning her.

“Yes!” said Gu Ning. She knew that Qi Tianlin read the news about them on the Internet. However, he was questioning her. Why was he mad at her? It had nothing to do with him that Leng Shaoting was her fiancé.

“Duuuu…”

Once Gu Ning finished, Qi Tianlin hung up on her. There was only a busy signal on the phone.

Gu Ning rolled her eyes. She didn’t mind and ended the call.

After making sure of Leng Shaoting’s relationship with Gu Ning, Qi Tianlin was in a terrible mood. He opened a bottle of red wine and tried to drown his sorrows in alcohol.

Because of his status and position, Qi Tianlin rarely drank. Even if he drank, he only drank a little. Alcohol might be harmful in his work.

“Boss, you…” Seeing that, Yu Hao tried to stop him. However, before he could finish, Qi Tianlin gave him a cold glance and he had to shut up.

“Get out,” said Qi Tianlin coldly.

Yu Hao gave a sigh. There was nothing he could do, so he could only walk out.

In fact, he told Qi Tianlin about the real relationship between Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning, but he didn’t expect his leader to be so emotional.

It seemed that his leader really loved Gu Ning, but unfortunately Gu Ning was already engaged. Anyway, he believed Qi Tianlin could control himself and wouldn’t get drunk.

Qi Tianlin wouldn’t get drunk and stopped after having a glass of wine. He thought it wasn’t necessary to get drunk since he had serious business to deal with. All in all, Qi Tianlin never lost his reason.

In fact, a romantic relationship wasn’t important for him and he shouldn’t fall in love due to his position as the leader of an illegal gang. However, he had fallen in love with Gu Ning and couldn’t stay calm right now.
