Chapter 1833: Impossible to Like Her

Gu Ning and her friends left after having a meal. They met Rong Jue and his mates outside the canteen, so they greeted them politely.

“Nice to see you, Instructor Rong.”

“Hi.” Rong Jue answered nonchalantly, then looked at Gu Ning and asked, “Do you need to go deal with what has happened today?”

If she needed to deal with it, he would allow her to leave.

As for what had happened today, it naturally referred to the drama about Kouzi sunscreen, and he believed that Gu Ning wouldn’t produce fakes.

“No need, if my subordinates can’t handle this matter properly, they should quit,” Gu Ning said.

“Right.” Rong Jue replied, and didn’t say anything further about it, then he left with a group of instructors.

However, in the short period of time when Gu Ning and Rong Jue talked with each other, many students were watching them. They kept guessing the relationship between Gu Ning and the chief instructor.

Although it was normal for an instructor to talk with a student, they had been in military training for more than a week, but they didn’t see the instructor talk to any students except for Gu Ning.

The instructor actually might have talked to other students without them noticing it, but they couldn’t help but think more when they saw the chief instructor talking to Gu Ning.

Most students didn’t think it was something unusual, while a few held a different idea.

As Gu Ning and Rong Jue were talking, Gu Ning obviously felt a jealous and spiteful gaze falling on her from close by.

Once Rong Jue left, Gu Ning gave a casual glance and saw the person who looked at her with jealousy and malice. It was a very beautiful girl, but Gu Ning didn’t know who she was and which class she was in. Anyway, she didn’t care about it. She wouldn’t be so easily affected just by an unkind look.

Gu Ning also guessed why the girl looked at her with jealous and spiteful eyes. If she didn’t guess wrong, it should be because of Rong Jue.

Even if she was jealous and resentful, Gu Ning wouldn’t bother to pay attention to her as long as she stayed away from her.

Nevertheless, after Rong Jue left, the girl walked towards Gu Ning.

There were two other girls with that girl, but the girl asked them to wait for her.

When she showed hostility to Gu Ning, Baili Zongxue also sensed it. When she saw her walking towards them, Baili Zongxue frowned. She glanced at Gu Ning. Seeing Gu Ning remaining calm, she said nothing.

As the girl approached Gu Ning, her jealousy and resentment had faded and she changed into a sweet and harmless appearance.

“Hi, do you know Instructor Rong?” the girl asked politely, showing no hostility.

“Not really. Just like the majority of our schoolmates, I only know that he is our chief instructor.” Gu Ning replied. Because she didn’t want to be dragged into unnecessary trouble, she explained it with patience.

“If so, why did he talk to you? I’ve never seen him talk to any females unless he knows her,” The girl said. Although she remained polite, she obviously didn’t believe what Gu Ning said.

Song Miaoge saw that she was unkind, so she coldly looked at the girl. “What’s the matter with you? Why can’t Instructor Rong talk with females? I’ve talked to him many times, so what?” she retorted.

“You...” Once the girl heard that, she looked at Song Miaoge with hatred.

What? She has talked to Jue many times before? How is it possible? It can’t be true.

The girl couldn’t accept it, because Rong Jue never said a word to her. He only gave her a faint response whenever she greeted him.

“Believe it or not, but it’s none of your business whether I know Instructor Rong.” Gu Ning’s tone was also obviously colder. She didn’t want to be dragged into unnecessary trouble, so she explained it just now, but it didn’t mean that she would explain it twice.

“Of course it’s my business. I’m Jue’s future wife. I don’t allow other girls to approach him,” the girl said, declaring her ownership and warning other women not to get close to Rong Jue as his future wife.

Actually, it was just her illusion, because Gu Ning and her friends had no intention of forming a relationship with Rong Jue.

“Ha-ha, ha-ha.” Hearing that, Song Miaoge snorted with laughter. She thought this girl was too funny. “Which one of your eyes saw that we want to form a relationship with instructor Rong? We just happened to meet each other and said hi. Why don’t you go and ask Instructor Rong about it?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Whether this girl was Rong Jue’s future wife, they didn’t know or care. However, if she deliberately caused trouble for them, they would be annoyed.

“You...” The girl didn’t know what to say all of a sudden after hearing that, because she wouldn’t go to ask Rong Jue about it. She was unwilling to annoy him.

As a result, the girl stopped arguing with them, but warned them in a cold voice. “I’m warning you to keep a distance away from Jue.”

After that, she turned around and left.

“It’s ridiculous!” Baili Zongxue said in a resigned tone.

“It’s impossible that Instructor Rong will like her given her character.” Song Miaoge sneered with disdain.

“Hard to say. The kids who were born in families of power have no right to decide whom to marry,” Gu Ning said.

Rong Jue didn’t like the girl, and had never bothered to pay attention to her. Unfortunately, because of their families’ relationship, Rong Jue’s mother always hoped that the girl could become her daughter-in-law. She was also trying to set them up.

Although the age difference between the two was nearly 10 years old, it didn’t matter.

“You’re right.” Song Miaoge agreed. Fortunately, her family wouldn’t do something like that. She could choose to marry the man she liked.

...

Once K took action, the truth soon came out. When people got up the next day, they saw the statement issued by the official Weibo of Kouzi.

Official Weibo of Kouzi: Recently, there is an incident of fake Kouzi sunscreen which has appeared on the Internet, which has caused serious reputation loss to our company. After investigation, we’ve successfully figured out the truth. Because Kouzi sunscreen became very popular and was sold out a few days ago, it was out of stock for a day. Unqualified manufacturers took advantage of that time and made fake Kouzi sunscreen, then sold it in many universities. We’ve collected solid evidence and formally filed a lawsuit to the court. At the same time, Kouzi reminds consumers to buy genuine products of our company at counters or from the official website. Our company won’t take any responsibility if you buy the products from other channels.

There were photos showing the evidence of fake sunscreens being produced by unqualified manufacturers.
