1029 Take Them as Gifts

Actually, Master Xu thought that Gu Ning should be Xu Jinchen’s girlfriend. In his eyes, Xu Jinchen should be a better choice than Leng Shaoting.He didn’t think that Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting weren’t a great match, but simply wanted to have such an outstanding granddaughter-in-law.

If Gu Ning were his future granddaughter-in-law, he would be so proud of her.

Xu Jinchen was old enough to be married now, so Master Xu was a little worried about him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Grandpa Jiang, Grandpa Xu, if there are any you like, you can choose a piece as a gift,” Gu Ning said. Since she sent Master Leng the Confederate Rose by Water right in front of them, she should send them a gift too.

“We can’t take them for free. They’re so valuable and we can pay for them,” Jiang Zhongyu said at once. They felt happy that Gu Ning was willing to give them gifts, but they had no intention to take them for free.

“Right!” Master Xu agreed.

“Oh, I should also thank you for your medicine which cured my disease,” Jiang Zhongyu said.

“Grandpa Jiang, you don’t need to thank me, thank Grandpa Leng, because he gave the medicine to you, not me,” Gu Ning said.

“I should thank you both for the great help!” Jiang Zhongyu said.

“Alright, but please allow me to give each of you a gift today. You’re both Grandpa Leng’s old friends, and I’m your granddaughter too. Their prices don’t matter at all,” Gu Ning said.

She really wanted to give them a gift, so she hoped that they would accept it.

“Ha-ha, ha-ha.” Jiang Zhongyu and Master Xu were amused and laughed with joy.

“Just take it. My granddaughter-in-law does it out of kindness, and you can’t turn her down,” Master Leng said and helped Gu Ning. He understood that Gu Ning was a very kind and generous girl.

Since Master Leng said that, Master Xu and Jiang Zhongyu were absolutely happy to receive a gift.

Both of them chose an antique they liked and thanked Gu Ning again.

A while later, a few antique collectors came, and they all knew Master Xu and Jiang Zhongyu, so they weren’t surprised to see them. However, when their sight fell on Leng Weihua, they got excited, because it was very rare to see him in real life. Because of Leng Weihua, they felt a little nervous.

...

When it was about 4:30 pm, they left for dinner together.

Gu Ning asked them where they wanted to have dinner.

They disliked dishes in hotels because those dishes always looked good but tasted terrible. They preferred to have some really delicious food in an underground restaurant.

Accordingly, Gu Ning took them to an underground restaurant which was located in a suburb near the capital. Although it was far from the antique street, it was close to their houses. So it would be convenient for them to go back home after dinner.

They would arrive at the underground restaurant at about 5 pm, and it would take half an hour for the dishes to be placed on the table. So before they set off, they needed to call for a reservation in advance. Luckily, there was still a private room available.

Master Leng told Gu Ning to sit in his car, and said that his bodyguard would drive Gu Ning’s car.

On the way there, Master Leng chatted casually with Gu Ning. They got along quite well, although there was a huge age gap between them.

About half an hour later, they arrived. The underground restaurant was very large, but there were only a few private rooms so that people could have more space to dine.

They saw the boss of the underground restaurant waiting for them outside when they arrived.

The boss was a middle-aged man around 40, and he walked forward to welcome them without delay. “It’s a great honor to see you all, Master Jiang, Master Leng, Master Xu!”

They were frequent visitors here, but the boss of the underground restaurant would still welcome them in person every time they showed up.

“Hi, how’s the business today?” Master Xu asked with a broad smile, like they were old friends.

“Not bad.” The boss also smiled, then guided them inside.

Once they entered the restaurant, they met a familiar face, Shen Yanfeng.

Shen Yanfeng and his friends also gathered there to share dinner.

The smile disappeared from Master Leng’s face when he saw Shen Yanfeng. He wanted to ignore Shen Yanfeng, but Shen Yanfeng already walked to him. “Hi, nice to see you all!”

“Hi,” Master Leng said, but had no intention to talk to him further.
