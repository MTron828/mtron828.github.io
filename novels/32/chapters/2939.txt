2940 It’s Me, Lovely Vine!

Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng had seen these two flood dragons before. The monster fox and the tree vine weren’t strange to them either, so they weren’t shocked, but the battle still amazed them.

Because it wasn’t a battle among mortals, it was extremely fierce and they all used magical skills. Even the underground hall couldn’t absorb the violence.

As a result, it suddenly shook heavily. The next moment, stones and sand started falling indicating that it was going to collapse.

“Go out now!” Leng Shaoting shouted at them. They had to leave as soon as possible, leaving those mutants behind.

Without delay, they immediately ran to the passage where they came from. However, the moment they gathered together, the ceiling of the hall fell.

Gu Ning released her magical power to make a barrier and protect them. In that case, rocks and sand couldn’t smash them, but they were buried underneath the hall.

Under the extreme pressure, Gu Ning found it hard to breathe.

The ground and Gobi were about twenty meters thick above the hall, so it was unbelievably heavy. It was like a mountain, and Gu Ning could barely hold it.

Seeing that, Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao joined Gu Ning and supported the barrier together.

“What should we do?” Xu Jinchen asked worriedly. After all, Gu Ning and the others were caught in this trouble because of them so Xu Jinchen blamed himself.

“Don’t worry. We can leave this place,” Gu Ning said. She wasn’t worried at all. They were stuck for the time being, but she could think of a solution.

Hearing that, Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng were less anxious.

Because the ground was still shaking, they did nothing, deciding to wait till it stopped.

At the same time, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to look around. The ninjas and mutants were already dead and buried in the dirt.

The earthquake didn’t stop until half an hour later, then Gu Ning asked the tree vine to dig a passage out.

The tree vine immediately went to do that. Although there were rocks mixed in the sand and it wasn’t easy to dig a way through, it wasn’t difficult for the tree vine. However, they were deep, so the tree vine worked for a long time till a passage which could allow a person to pass was made.

Afterwards, the white flood dragon went out first, then Gu Ning. She put the monster fox back into her telepathic eye space before going out. Leng Shaoting protected Chen Meng, while Jing Yunyao protected Xu Jinchen, when they went out. The back flood dragon was the final one.

Because the passage was straight, they didn’t climb out slowly, but directly flew outside. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng felt as if they were taken to the sky by a strong force, so they were scared. They didn’t come back to their senses until they had been back on the ground for a long while.

Unfortunately, when they were about to leave, they heard a buzz over their heads. It was an enemy helicopter and there were three of them. Obviously, there were more ninjas and mutants coming.

“Let’s hide now!” Leng Shaoting said. Then they hid at the foot of the Gobi. At the same time, Leng Shaoting waved his hand and rolled up a sandstorm to cover the cave.

They weren’t afraid of the ninjas and mutants, but they needed to wait till they landed. Otherwise the ninjas and mutants might directly leave if they saw them.

Even if they didn’t come down, Leng Shaoting and the others could still deal with them, but it would be more convenient to have the battle on the ground.

About ten minutes later, the three helicopters landed.

Although it was usually impossible for the helicopter to land in the Demon City Desert due to the strong sandstorm, it could land if there were no sandstorms.

At this moment, there were no sandstorms, so the helicopters smoothly landed.

There were twelve of them in all. In addition to the pilots, there were six mutants and six ninjas, because each ninja had a mutant to control.

After they got down, Gu Ning and the others walked out.

As soon as they saw them, they were scared. They didn’t expect to see other people here.

“Who are you?” They questioned Gu Ning in Language R, because none of them could speak Language Hua.

“We came to kill you,” Gu Ning replied in Language R as well.

Once she finished, they directly attacked the ninjas and mutants. The monster fox and the tree vine stayed to protect Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng.

Facing the monster fox and the tree vine, Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng were slightly scared, even though they knew they wouldn’t hurt them. After all, they were monsters.

“Hi, nice to see you,” Xu Jinchen said to them.

Because they were monsters, he couldn’t communicate with them, so the tree vine turned into a boy and replied. “Hi, Brother Xu and Brother Chen, nice to see you too.”

Seeing that, Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng were frightened and subconsciously moved a few steps back.

They were amazed by how the tree vine turned into a boy.

“You…” Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng could barely speak, looking at the tree vine.

“It’s me, lovely Vine!” The tree vine giggled.

This wasn’t the first time that Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng met the tree vine when it had the shape of a boy. They were aware of its existence, but Gu Ning only introduced him as her friend’s child, so they didn’t know that it was actually a monster until now.

Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng were totally shocked, but they soon calmed down after seeing the familiar boy.

“Jesus, the tree vine can take the shape of a boy!” Xu Jinchen said in amazement. He knew that monsters and ghosts really existed, but this was the first time that he had witnessed it with his eyes.

“Can it turn into a human as well?” Chen Meng turned to stare at the monster fox.

“It can’t do that right now, but perhaps in the near future,” the tree vine said.

“Wow, that’s unbelievable.” Xu Jinchen and Chen Meng were amazed again.

About ten minutes later, Gu Ning and the others had killed all of the ninjas and mutants.

“Did you scare them?” Gu Ning frowned slightly, looking at the tree vine.

Although she didn’t want the tree vine to show its abilities in front of other people, it wasn’t a big deal since it already did.

“They’re scared, but not too badly, ha-ha,” the tree vine replied.
