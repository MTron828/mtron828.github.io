Chapter 1386: Out of Pills

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Master Leng wasn’t as mad at what had happened yesterday anymore, but he was still displeased so the smile disappeared from his face the second he saw Jiang Shuyuan.

The others fell into silence too.

“Father, I know it’s my fault and I shouldn’t have acted against Gu Ning before. I promise it won’t happen again. Please, help me get the medicine for Shaojia. Shaojia began to moan from the pain the moment she woke up. My heart is almost broken.” Jiang Shuyuan begged Master Leng.

Although she didn’t really mean it when she said that she regretted that she had acted against Gu Ning before, it was quite touching when she talked about Leng Shaojia as a mother.

Master Leng melted, seeing that. He was Leng Shaojia’s grandfather after all. However, it was still embarrassing for him to ask Gu Ning for the medicine right now. Therefore, Master Leng felt cornered. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Father!” Jiang Shuyuan was anxious.

“Alright, I’ll think about it,” Master Leng said, then stood up and went back to his room.

Jiang Shuyuan wanted to say something else, but she was worried that Master Leng would be annoyed again.

When Master Leng was gone, Yu Yin said, “Shuyuan, father needs some time, and it’s not easy for father to help you this time given what you’ve done to Gu Ning before.”

Hearing that, Jiang Shuyuan frowned. She didn’t think it was a problem. As long as Master Leng asked Gu Ning for the medicine, Gu Ning would give it to him if she wanted to marry into the Leng family. It was unreasonable that Master Leng had to beg Gu Ning for help.

Seeing Jiang Shuyuan’s expression, the others knew what she was thinking. They all felt disappointed in her. “Shuyuan, do you think it’s not a problem at all?” Leng Yuanjin asked.

“Am I wrong?” Jiang Shuyuan became straightforward when Master Leng was absent.

“Of course you are! Did you forget what you have done to Gu Ning before? Your attitude towards her is so terrible!” Leng Yuanjin said.

Jiang Shuyuan felt a little embarrassed, then closed her mouth. She knew what she had done to Gu Ning was unacceptable, but she still believed that Gu Ning should help them. It was only a pill, so Jiang Shuyuan didn’t think it was a big deal.

Master Leng hesitated in his room for almost an hour, then still called Gu Ning.

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were about to have a walk outside when Gu Ning received Master Leng’s call. Gu Ning took her phone out, and Leng Shaoting saw the caller’s name too, so he said, “You can’t give it to them.”

“Fine, I won’t.” Gu Ning was amused by his childlike angry face.

After that, she picked up the call. “Hi, grandpa.”

“Ningning, what are you doing now?” Master Leng asked, feeling uneasy.

“Well, I just left my house and plan to dine outside,” Gu Ning said. She didn’t tell Master Leng that Leng Shaoting was by her side now, because Leng Shaoting didn’t tell his grandfather that he was already back.

“Um, there is something I need to talk about with you...” Master Leng said.

“Sure,” Gu Ning said.

Master Leng then told Gu Ning what had happened to Leng Shaojia. “I know Shaojia is a spoiled kid and she has done many terrible things to you before. I shouldn’t turn to you for help because you never got along with her. I know it’s unfair and you might feel aggrieved, but Shaojia is my granddaughter, so...”

“Grandpa, I don’t care what Leng Shaojia has done to me before, but I just rescued one of my friends yesterday so I’m out of those pills now. I’m so sorry, but I can give you once I get some,” Gu Ning said. It was absolutely a lie.

Although she felt a little guilty when she lied to Master Leng, she was left no choice. She needed to think about herself and live for herself.

Hearing that, Master Leng was disappointed, but he didn’t think further about it. He knew that Gu Ning was unwilling to help Leng Shaojia, but he was also aware that Gu Ning was a very kind girl. After all, Gu Ning had helped many people who had no relationship with her before. Therefore, Master Leng believed Gu Ning’s lie.

Actually, if Leng Shaojia hadn’t tried to hurt Gu Ning, Gu Ning would be willing to help her now for the sake of Master Leng. Unfortunately, the terrible car accident had already happened, and Gu Ning felt disgusted once she thought of Leng Shaojia.

It was impossible for Gu Ning to help Leng Shaojia now.

Besides, if Master Leng found out that the mastermind of the car accident was Leng Shaojia, he would be angry at Leng Shaojia too.

Gu Ning understood that Master Leng was a smart and reasonable elder, and he wouldn’t blame her.

Since Gu Ning was out of pills, Master Leng gave up.

He planned to not tell the others the result, because Jiang Shuyuan would blame Gu Ning for it. He decided to take the responsibility himself and told the others that he didn’t call Gu Ning for the pill at all.

At 2:30 pm, Zeng Kai was brought to the court.

Because Peng Xinghao was injured, it wasn’t convenient for him to be present, so his lawyer showed up on his behalf.

The lawyer was assigned by Gu Ning.
