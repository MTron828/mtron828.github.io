Chapter 1692: Leng Shaoting’s Mother

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

They would deal with it when the police came, so Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao left first.

Because there were too many people who were staring at Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao, they didn’t notice that one of them looked totally shocked.

The person was a middle-aged woman, but she didn’t focus on Gu Ning, instead she focused on Jing Yunyao. It was obvious that she knew Jing Yunyao.

When the woman got her mind back, Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao had already left, and she took out her phone and called a caller named Jinchen at once.

At this time, Xu Jinchen and Leng Shaoting were on their way to the capital, and were about to arrive.

Xu Jinchen’s phone suddenly rang, and the caller was his mother.

It turned out that the middle-aged woman who stared at Jing Yunyao with shock was Xu Jinchen’s mother.

Because Xu Jinchen was driving, he put it on speaker.

“Hi, mom, what’s up?” asked Xu Jinchen.

“Jinchen, I just saw a woman outside where we live. She closely resembles Shaoting’s mother and most importantly she was with Gu Ning!” Mrs. Xu said with great excitement.

Mrs. Xu recognized Gu Ning too. Although she had never seen her in person before, she had seen many of her photos on the Internet. And it was precisely because she knew Gu Ning and Gu Ning’s relationship with Leng Shaoting, that she was astonished by what she saw at the accident scene.

The Xu family and the Leng family had been friends for dozens of years, so Mrs. Xu definitely knew Yunyao. Actually, they had a good relationship.

“What?” Hearing that, Xu Jinchen was shocked and slammed on the brakes.

Leng Shaoting who was sitting on the front passenger’s seat was also taken aback, then he figured out why Gu Ning wanted him to directly go back to the Leng family’s old house today.

Leng Shaoting believed that the woman who closely resembled his mother must be his mother, or Gu Ning wouldn’t ask him to go back home.

When did Gu Ning find his mother?

Although he was mentally-prepared for the fact that Yunyao could still be alive, Leng Shaoting was still astonished when he heard that it was the truth. His heart began to pound fast, and he got nervous in an instant.

“What’s that sound? Is it the sound of brakes?” Mrs. Xu heard the abrupt sound when Xu Jinchen came to a sudden halt. She was too shocked by the woman who closely resembled Yunyao, so she didn’t ask what Xu Jinchen was doing before she shared this shocking news with him.

“Yeah, I’m driving, and I was scared by what you just said.” Xu Jinchen calmed himself down and said.

Leng Shaoting was actually more shocked than him.

All of a sudden, Xu Jinchen turned to look at Leng Shaoting worriedly.

“Are you alright?” Mrs. Xu was anxious.

“I’m fine. Alright, I need to go now,” said Xu Jinchen and directly hung up the call. It wasn’t the time to talk with his mother right now.

“Shaoting, are you alright? Um...” Xu Jinchen wanted to say something now, but he didn’t know what he should say.

In Xu Jinchen’s eyes, Leng Shaoting’s mother already passed away, so he didn’t think that the woman could be Shaoting’s mother. They probably just looked alike.

As for the reason why she was with Gu Ning, he was confused, but couldn’t make any guesses before he knew details.

“I’m fine. Keep on driving,” said Leng Shaoting, and there was no emotion in his voice.

Although Leng Shaoting actually had mixed emotions, he hid them away from other people, like he usually did. Therefore, Xu Jinchen could see that Leng Shaoting changed his expression, but couldn’t feel any emotions from him.

However, even though he wasn’t sure how Leng Shaoting felt now, he knew that he shouldn’t be curious about it and started the car again.

After a while, Xu Jinchen asked with uncertainty, “Are we continuing to return to the Leng family’s old house?”

Leng Shaoting already told Xu Jinchen that he needed to go back to the Leng family’s old house, but Xu Jinchen wasn’t sure about it now after his mother’s call.

“Yeah,” Leng Shaoting said.

It was obvious that Gu Ning told him to go back to the Leng family’s old house because the woman who closely resembled his mother was there.

Leng Shaoting always wanted to find his mother, but he was quite nervous now that he was really going to see her. He didn’t know what to say, because his mother was “dead” for 15 years.

They became strange to each other after the separation of 15 years, but they were connected by blood after all, so it was impossible to cut the feeling between them. That was the reason why Leng Shaoting didn’t know what he should do or how to face it.

Xu Jinchen suddenly realized that Gu Ning and the woman who closely resembled Shaoting’s mother were going to the Leng family’s old house too!

His home wasn’t far from the Leng family’s old house, and it only took several minutes to get there by car. It seemed that the woman who closely resembled Shaoting’s mother could really be his mother!

Thinking of that, Xu Jinchen was shocked and couldn’t believe it. However, he didn’t have a better explanation for that.

Xu Jinchen was so curious that he almost asked about it aloud, but he still controlled himself. No matter what, he knew that Leng Shaoting couldn’t wait to meet the woman, so he sped up at once.

In fact, no matter how fast Xu Jinchen drove, Leng Shaoting still felt it was too slow. Even though he didn’t know what to do later, he still wanted to see her as soon as possible. He also knew that Xu Jinchen already drove as fast as possible, so he didn’t urge him because it would be dangerous if he drove too fast. They were in the city center now, and there was more and more traffic on the road.

And precisely because of that, Xu Jinchen didn’t know whether he was in a rush to meet the woman or not. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At the same time, Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao arrived at the Leng family’s old house at 9:30 am.

The members of the Leng family didn’t go outside today, except for Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia who were still in the hospital. Leng Shaoming was also absent, because he was working in another city.

Leng Shaoxun and Leng Shaoxi were in the yard now. They didn’t know that Gu Ning would come this morning, so they were surprised to see her when she showed up.

“Nice to see you again, ma’am.” Leng Shaoxun greeted Jing Yunyao first, because she was older than them.
