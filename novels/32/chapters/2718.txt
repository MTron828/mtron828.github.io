Chapter 2721: They Are So Weak!

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“We’re being followed. Do we need to avoid them by speeding up, or should we directly fight them?” asked Xu Jinchen. He knew that Gu Ning must have noticed them before him. No matter how many men there were, he believed that they would be safe with Gu Ning there. He only needed to ask her what to do next.

“They are targeting me. Stop the car where there is no one around. We need to get rid of them,” said Gu Ning.

They were in Country R so if they didn’t get rid of those men right now, they would continue to chase them. As soon as they were exposed, it would ruin their plans.

Therefore, they had to deal with the problem right away and stop those men from following them. They had to keep their plan a secret.

Hearing that Gu Ning was the target, Xu Jinchen was surprised. “How come your enemies are here after we came to Country R? Were they hired to hurt you?”

Xu Jinchen felt that the men must have been hired by Gu Ning’s enemies in their own country to hurt her in Country R.

“Well, I just had an argument with two men from Country R at the airport, so they must have decided to get revenge here,” said Gu Ning.

Hearing that, Xu Jinchen nodded.

“In order to stop them from finding out about our plan, we must get rid of them as quickly as possible. We can’t let them follow us all the way,” said Gu Ning.

“No problem,” said Xu Jinchen, not speeding up.

Before they found a suitable place, Gu Ning asked about Leng Shaoting.

“Oh, can you tell me more about the situation,” asked Gu Ning. When she asked about Leng Shaoting, she looked very serious.

“We carried out a task involving mutants this time. We found mutants in our country so Shaoting wanted to find their lair and completely destroy it. So we followed them here. Shaoting didn’t want all of us to be exposed, so he followed the mutants by himself. He told us to wait in City Gang and said that if he hasn’t contacted us in five days, we should report it to the president and call you. We all believed in Shaoting’s abilities, so we decided to wait for a day or two longer. If Shaoting was still missing, we would report it to the president. Now it has been a week and Shaoting still hasn’t contacted us. So we called the president,” said Xu Jinchen. Even though he didn’t think that Leng Shaoting would be in trouble, they had no idea what could happen.

“Do you know which direction Shaoting went?” asked Gu Ning.

“We only know that he went to the sea at the XX pier, but we don’t know which direction he went afterwards. We think that if the other party went to a secret base, then it’s likely to be at the bottom of the sea or on an island. We also checked the map, and there are many islands around. Some are big and some are small, but not all islands are marked on the map, and not all islands can be visited,” Xu Jingchen said.

“Generally, bases are either deep in the mountains, on islands, or at the bottom of the sea. Currently we don’t know where Shaoting is, so we can only look for it along the XX coast. Just leave it to me, my master and Shaoting’s mother. At night is the ideal time for action, so you can directly take us to the XX coast,” Gu Ning said, without asking Shangguan Yang and Jing Yunyao’s opinion. She directly made the decision on her own, because she knew that Shangguan Yang and Jing Yunyao would agree with her.

“Sure,” said Xu Jinchen, listening to Gu Ning. They had no idea how to find and help Leng Shaoting, so they turned to Gu Ning for help.

If their enemies were normal people, they could do it on their own, but they were going to be facing ninjas and mutants.

“Do you have a map? Let me have a look,” said Gu Ning.

“Yeah, I have several with me. They’re in the box in front of the front passenger’s seat,” said Xu Jinchen.

Jing Yunyao was sitting in the front passenger’s seat, so she immediately took out three maps, and gave them to Gu Ning and Shangguan Yang.

After they got the map, they found the pier that Xu Jingchen told them about, and started to look at the surrounding landmarks from the pier.

From the airport to the city center of City Gang, there were many small remote villages around. In order to avoid local citizens and get rid of the men who were following them behind, they drove towards a narrow path.

Those men were also waiting for a chance to take action, so after Gu Ning took the narrow path they felt there was a chance.

When they got to a remote place and there were no cars in front or behind, Gu Ning asked Xu Jingchen to stop. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

However, the people who followed them didn’t think too much about it. They didn’t even think that they had been discovered, and had no idea that Gu Ning deliberately stopped to deal with them.

Instead, they thought that Gu Ning’s car might have broken, causing her to stop.

After the car stopped, Gu Ning got out. She pretended as if she was going to fix it, so she checked the car.

Because Gu Ning could handle it alone, the others stayed in the car.

The next moment, the men’s car stopped close to them. Five men got out with wood sticks in their hands.

Without hesitation, they attacked Gu Ning. They didn’t have any sympathy for Gu Ning just because she was a girl. They didn’t care whether they targeted the right person either.

The man who paid them had taken a photo of Gu Ning’s back. So although they didn’t have a picture from her front, they still easily recognized her.

Gu Ning fought back at once. In order to finish the fight quickly, Gu Ning directly broke their limbs and used her cold magical power to freeze them. They wouldn’t be disabled, but couldn’t have a full recovery.

They had learned some skills, but were hardly comparable to Gu Ning. Even though she didn’t have aweapon, she still easily beat them.

Within a minute, Gu Ning defeated all of them.

Afterwards, Gu Ning immediately got back in the car and left.

Those men were shocked by Gu Ning’s abilities. They didn’t expect a young girl to be so strong.

“They’re so weak!” Xu Jinchen said disdainfully.
