Chapter 1830: Too Poor to Be a Princess

“I agree with what Gu Ning said,” Baili Zongxue said.

“As long as you agree, you can leave it to me. Don’t worry, you just need to focus on the fight then. Moreover, you only need to be ready to play a dirty trick. It might not need to be used,” Gu Ning said. They only needed to be fully prepared in case accidents happened.

Although she could secretly do it without Song Miaoge noticing it at all, she still felt that it would be better to tell her.

“Okay, I agree,” Song Miaoge said.

Afterwards, Gu Ning took out a power crystal and gave it to Song Miaoge.

“Gu Ning, I brought the pill you gave me. I think I should take mine!” Song Miaoge said. She felt embarrassed to ask for Gu Ning’s medicine again. After all, it wasn’t cheap.

“It’s nothing. Take it!” Gu Ning said.

Although power crystals were indeed not cheap and were actually quite expensive, Gu Ning offered different prices to different people.

People like Qi Tianlin were too rich to care about money, so she sold it to them for a million yuan one pill.

For those who didn’t have much money, she was willing to sell it at the price of hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands yuan.

For her family and friends, it was merely a worthless pill. It was just used as proof of her affection.

Since Gu Ning said that, Song Miaoge no longer refused. After thanking her, she took it straight away.

Baili Zongxue didn’t feel displeased when Gu Ning gave Song Miaoge another power crystal instead of giving it to her. She wasn’t a stingy person, so she shouldn’t be angry with Gu Ning because of such things. Gu Ning had the right to give her medicine to anyone she wanted to.

The power crystal instantly melted in Song Miaoge’s mouth. It was colorless and tasteless, but she felt a cool feeling flowing in her body, which was very comfortable.

In a short while, the pain and fatigue left in her body after fighting against Gu Ning quickly went away. Afterwards, she felt that her body was lighter and stronger than before. Song Miaoge rounded her eyes in shock and couldn’t believe it.

The effect of this medicine was so good.

Baili Zongxue also knew that this medicine was very effective, especially for mortals. However, when she saw it with her own eyes, she was still amazed.

“Alright, let’s start training! I might use great strength,” Gu Ning said.

She just tested Song Miaoge’s skills just now, and now the formal training began.

“No problem.” Song Miaoge solemnly responded. After all, a strict teacher produced outstanding students, so Gu Ning wouldn’t be gentle to Song Miaoge, because it could help her make quick progress.

Because of the power crystal, Song Miaoge became much more flexible and powerful than before, which made her very happy.

At 9:30 pm, Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao returned to the dormitory. Both of them carried many shopping bags. They also bought clothes from Gufan and some famous skin care products.

When they returned to the dormitory, they didn’t see Gu Ning and Song Miaoge, but they saw a few bags on Song Miaoge’s desk. They were shopping bags from Gufan and Kouzi.

Seeing that, Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao were both stunned.

“No way! How can Song Miaoge afford clothes from Gufan and the skin care products from Kouzi? There are so many bags. She seems to have bought a lot,” Lu Xiaoxiao exclaimed, then looked at Gao Shiyan. “Shiyan, did we misunderstand her? Is her family actually rich? If not, she shouldn’t be able to spend so much money on these things.”

Gao Shiyan was displeased, because she didn’t want Song Miaoge to have a good family background. However, after further thinking, she believed Song Miaoge’s family couldn’t be very rich, so she said, “Several thousand yuan isn’t much anyway. Since her father is a soldier, at his age, he’s supposed to be in a relatively important position. It’s normal for her father to have a salary of ten or twenty thousand yuan a month. Her mother is a policewoman. It’s not a big deal that she can afford things that cost a few thousand yuan.”

“You’re right.” Lu Xiaoxiao agreed, then mocked Song Miaoge, “Although her parents probably have a monthly salary of thirty or forty thousand yuan, she spent a few thousand yuan on shopping. She is very vane. She’s too poor to be a princess, but I think she’s pretty enough to be a mistress.”

“Well, it’s really possible in the future!” Gao Shiyan agreed in an unkind tone, because she had the same idea.

She wished all her opponents could live a terrible life.

Gao Shiyan withdrew her gaze from Song Miaoge’s desk, then glanced at Gu Ning’s desk and bed to see if she had also bought a lot of things like Song Miaoge. However, there was nothing.

It seemed that Gu Ning didn’t have much money. Even if she had some, she must be in the same situation as Song Miaoge. Gao Shiyan was sure that her family must be much richer than theirs.

...

Gu Ning and Song Miaoge returned to the dormitory at 10:20 pm.

Gu Ning had trained Song Miaoge with a serious attitude today. It was more difficult than her previous training, so Song Miaoge had a sore body at the end of the day. However, Gu Ning didn’t give her another power crystal, nor did she allow her to take the one she had given her earlier.

Only by personal experience, could she better experience it and make progress.

Luckily, Song Miaoge trained all year round, so she could accept the pain.

They already decided to pay no attention to Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao, so they didn’t even give a glance at them after walking inside, and went straight to take a shower.

The next day, Gu Ning woke Song Miaoge up at 5 am. Because their movements were very light, they did not wake Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao.

At 5:10 am, they went out. As soon as they stepped out of their dorm room, the door of the dormitory next door opened, and Baili Zongxue showed up too, because they agreed to run and train together today.

At this time, no one was walking around on campus.

Gu Ning and her friends ran for half an hour before stopping.

Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue were not tired, but Song Miaoge was really tired.

Even though Song Miaoge was exhausted, Gu Ning only gave her 10 minutes of rest. Once 10 minutes were over, they started training.

In 10 minutes, Song Miaoge got her strength back. After all, she had taken a power crystal, so her body was very different from before. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

During last night’s training, Gu Ning not only had a fight against Song Miaoge, but also taught her some skills. She would teach her something new after she got familiar with those skills.

After taking a power crystal, Song Miaoge felt that she was making obvious progress when she was practicing martial arts. Although the progress wasn’t great, it was just the beginning.

She still had a month to make a little progress every day. After a month, she would have made a lot of progress.

Her only goal now was to defeat Ji Wenna. If it was possible for her not to play a dirty trick, she would not do it, but she would be ready.
