3261 The Mastermind Isn’t Qin Wentao

Chu Jianan frowned. He thought of what had happened these days, then said, “I argued with Mo Jinlin last week, but it’s not serious. We only had an argument.”

However, he didn’t think that Mo Jinlin wouldn’t pay him back because Mo Jinlin loved playing dirty tricks and harboring grudges.

Obviously, Chu Zhaofeng clearly knew what kind of person Mo Jinlin was, so it was possible that Mo Jinlin paid him back even if there was no serious conflict between them.

Mrs. Chu was aware of that too, so she guessed. “Is it Mo Jinlin?”

“I don’t know, but it’s possible. We will only know after Lin’s investigation,” said Chu Zhaofeng. He wasn’t sure whether it was Mo Jinlin.

Lin was Chu Zhaofeng’s secretary. He had outstanding abilities, so Chu Zhaofeng assigned the task to him. However, Lin hadn’t found any useful information yet.

Did they have to bear it?

No, they were reluctant to do that.

Unfortunately, they could do nothing about it. Could they directly question the Leng family?

…

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t go to bed after she got home. Instead, she investigated those men who tried to attack Ling Tianqi and his friends tonight.

About 10 pm three days ago, Sheng and his brothers were indeed in XX bar. His friend really brought a man to see them, but the man wasn’t Qin Wentao.

This man should have been sent over by Qin Wentao. Otherwise, someone must be scheming against Qin Wentao.

For the time being, Leng Xiaoyao felt that it was more likely for Qin Wentao to be schemed against. Since the man wasn’t Qin Wentao, why did he introduce himself as Qin Wentao?

Normally, people who paid to beat someone tended to keep their identities secret unless they were familiar.

Without delay, Leng Xiaoyao investigated the man who claimed to be Qin Wentao.

After an investigation, she found that the man was indeed not Qin Wentao, but Qin Wentao’s cousin who served Qin Wenming.

Leng Xiaoyao knew little about the Qin family, but the current situation proved everything. Qin Wenming sent some people to attack Ling Tianqi and the others using Qin Wentao’s name. He tried to frame Qin Wentao by making Ling Tianqi think that it was done by Qin Wentao. Afterwards, Qin Wentao would be paid back.

Leng Xiaoyao collected information of what Qin Wentao was doing recently, then found that he just got a project last week.

In that case, Qin Wenming must have felt that he was being overshadowed by Qin Wentao and wanted to frame Qin Wentao.

After the investigation, Leng Xiaoyao immediately called Ling Tianqi although it was very late.

Right after Ling Tianqi fell asleep, his phone rang and scared him but he wasn’t unhappy.

“Yeah. The mastermind isn’t Qin Wentao,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“What? It’s not Qin Wentao?” Ling Tianqi was shocked. After all, Sheng already confessed that Qin Wentao paid them to attack him, so he thought it was the truth. Unexpectedly, the mastermind turned out not to be Qin Wentao.

“Then who is it?” asked Ling Tianqi.

“It’s Qin Wenming. They’re competing against each other, and you were dragged into trouble,” said Leng Xiaoyao.

“Oh! Then we must let Qin Wentao know. We can get them to beat each other, but we can’t let Qin Wenming go so easily,” Ling Tianqi said with displeasure. He wasn’t a weak man, and was actually more vicious than his peers. Therefore, he was determined to punish Qin Wenming too.

“Do you need me to send the evidence to Qin Wentao anonymously, or do you want to handle it yourself?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“Just leave it to me!” said Ling Tianqi. He had bothered Leng Xiaoyao a lot, so he decided to do it on his own.

In that case, Leng Xiaoyao sent the evidence to Ling Tianqi after hanging up the call.

…

The next day, Leng Yuqi was still in a bad mood because of Chu Jianan’s betrayal, so she didn’t go to school.

When Leng Xiaoyao arrived at school, she met Jiang Yihan at the gate by accident.

As soon as Jiang Yihan saw Leng Xiaoyao, she subconsciously observed her surroundings to see whether Leng Yuqi was there too.

Leng Yuqi didn’t come in the Leng family’s car, which meant she wouldn’t come to school today. Therefore, Jiang Yihan didn’t need to see Leng Yuqi.

Although Jiang Yihan was happy when Leng Yuqi learned about her affair with Chu Jianan, she felt anxious after thinking about it twice. If Leng Yuqi exposed it, she would be humiliated.

Luckily, Leng Yuqi was absent, so she was slightly relieved. Unfortunately, Leng Xiaoyao was here!

Even if Leng Yuqi had a bad relationship with Leng Xiaoyao, they were both members of the Leng family. As a result, Jiang Yihan didn’t dare to meet Leng Xiaoyao’s eyes.

However, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care about Jiang Yihan. Although Jiang Yihan also humiliated the Leng family, she wouldn’t have been able to do anything if Chu Jianan didn’t give her a chance.

Since Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t looking at her, Jiang Yihan finally relaxed.

However, when Jiang Yihan saw Chu Jiayu, she panicked again. She wondered whether Chu Jiayu would hate her after knowing about her affair with Chu Jianan.

After all, Chu Jiayu was Chu Jianan’s younger sister, so she didn’t want Chu Jiayu to hate her. She even wanted Chu Jiayu’s support.

Because Chu Jiayu didn’t seem to be in a good mood, Jiang Yihan was very anxious. However, she still asked with concern, “Jiayu, what’s wrong? You look unhappy.”

Chu Jiayu pouted and said unhappily, “Jianan was beaten by someone last night. He’s still in the hospital right now.”

“What? Jianan is injured? Is it serious? Do you know who did it?” Jiang Yihan was scared. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Seeing Jiang Yihan’s emotional reaction, Chu Jiayu felt that it was a little strange, but she didn’t think much about it. “The doctor can’t find any injuries, but he is in a lot of pain all over. We don’t know who did it.”

Was it done by the Leng family?

That was the first idea Jiang Yihan had because Leng Yuqi found out about their affair yesterday. It was possible that the Leng family punished Chu Jianan for that.

If so, would the Leng family injure her too?

Thinking of that, Jiang Yihan was afraid.

Although the Jiang family was rich too, she had hurt Leng Yuqi first!

When class was about to start, Leng Yuqi was still absent. Chu Jiayu asked curiously, “Why didn’t Yuqi come to school today?”

Jiang Yihan panicked a little and lowered her head to avoid Chu Jiayu’s eyes in case Chu Jiayu saw through her. “I don’t know.”

“Let me call her.” Saying that, Chu Jiayu took out her phone and wanted to call Leng Yuqi.
