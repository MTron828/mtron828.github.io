Chapter 1275: Cut a Finger

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Once Gu Ning got out of the car, Lin Fei and his friends surrounded her. “Gu Ning, you’re so awesome!”

“You’re much better than I thought!”

“Are you a professional race driver?”

“Gu Ning, I’m your fan from now on.”

“...”

They kept complimenting Gu Ning.

The audience didn’t know that the race driver in the No.2 racing car was a girl until Gu Ning showed her face, and everyone was shocked. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Jesus, the winner is a girl!”

“I can’t believe my eyes.”

“Wow, I’m surprised that a girl can do better than a boy at car racing.”

“Of course girls can be better than boys.”

“It’s really amazing!”

“...”

When Masaichi Yoshida arrived, Gu Ning walked to his racing car, followed by Lin Fei and his friends. They were ready to laugh at Masaichi Yoshida.

“Hi, loser,” Gu Ning said to Masaichi Yoshida.

“So what? Do you dare to cut one of my fingers? I’m an exchange student in your country. If I’m hurt, it can become an international issue. Can you bear the result?” Masaichi Yoshida said.

It seemed that he was going to deny the agreement he had with Gu Ning.

Masaichi Yoshida was reluctant to lose a finger, and he was determined to get revenge on Gu Ning.

Lin Fei and his friends exchanged a glance with each other. Although they really hated Masaichi Yoshida and couldn’t wait to teach him a lesson, they knew that what he said was right.

“Well, do you want to deny the agreement we just had?” Gu Ning sneered.

“Yes, and what can you do about it?” Masaichi Yoshida admitted it without delay. He was a shameless person. Besides, he still looked very arrogant as if he was confident that Gu Ning couldn’t do anything to hurt him.

“What if I lost the game? Could I deny it as well?” Gu Ning asked.

“Are you kidding me? Of course you can’t,” Masaichi Yoshida said.

Gu Ning was displeased. “I’m afraid you can’t deny it either this time.”

The next second, Gu Ning moved towards Masaichi Yoshida and caught his hand like lightning. Without hesitation, she cut his little finger with a knife.

Gu Ning moved too fast so nobody could see her movement clearly. Even Masaichi Yoshida didn’t realize what had happened until his little finger was cut off.

He screamed in pain, which scared everyone.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya, however, stayed calm.

After all, it wasn’t the first time that Gu Ning had taught shameless people a lesson in a cruel way.

The second Gu Ning cut Masaichi Yoshida’s little finger, she secretly put her magical power into the wound to relieve the pain.

Gu Ning did that, not because she was nice to him, but because she just needed to cut one of his fingers off and was unwilling to make the situation worse.

Masaichi Yoshida was full of anger now, so he didn’t pay attention to what Gu Ning was doing.

Gu Ning then let him go and went back to her previous position.

“Don’t humiliate your country by being a coward.” Gu Ning looked down her nose at Masaichi Yoshida.

It was Masaichi Yoshida who set the bet before the game anyway. He also had the intention to sexually assault Gu Ning. Gu Ning was simply protecting herself.

“You...” Masaichi Yoshida was still in shock. He couldn’t believe that Gu Ning really dared to cut his finger. He felt angry and humiliated at the same time. In Masaichi Yoshida’s eyes, Gu Ning was inferior to him, so she shouldn’t act against him.

Masaichi Yoshida was self-centered and ridiculously stupid.

“Masaichi Yoshida, don’t you know that you’re very disgusting and shameless? Nobody likes you here, because you don’t behave yourself at all. Don’t you have any sense of manners?” Gu Ning said.

Actually, onlookers were also very mad at Masaichi Yoshida. He didn’t know how to respect other people, and believed that he was superior to others.

It was true that nobody liked him there. Fang Tiansheng and the other brown-nosers were also like rats crossing the streets.
