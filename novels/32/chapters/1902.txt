Chapter 1903: A Hateful Woman

Hearing that, Rong Zechen frowned. It turned out that Gu Ning was aware of his family background, but she didn’t have a different attitude towards him just because of that. It was the first time he had encountered such a cold treatment!

Almost every person tried to please him after knowing that he was the heir of the Rong family.

Besides, Gu Ning also said that she didn’t think a really outstanding man needed to show off his family background to prove himself.

He thought that what she said wasn’t wrong, but he didn’t agree with her on that. Because people with an influential family background would have a higher starting point and more opportunities than those without a family background. Therefore, they had a greater chance to become successful.

Gu Ning relied on herself to become successful, but she was very rare in this world.

It was precisely because Gu Ning was especially outstanding, that Rong Zechen had a very good impression of her.

All in all, they were attracted by each other’s status.

Gu Ning understood that, but she still believed that really outstanding people didn’t need their family background to prove themselves.

“Well, only those who don’t have a powerful family background emphasize abilities. It’s a realistic society. People with an influential background can easily become more successful than ordinary people. To be honest, if I want to make things difficult for you, it’s just a piece of cake for me,” said the girl with arrogance.

“Right, I agree that it’s a realistic society, and those who have a powerful family background can easily gain more success than ordinary people. You were born in a powerful family. I don’t know whether you can bully other people as you want, but you better not try to cause me trouble. It won’t do you any good,” said Gu Ning. Although it sounded a little aggressive, she was unwilling to be taken as weak.

“You...” The girl was surprised by Gu Ning’s response and felt displeased at being threatened. “How dare you threaten me? Do you know who I am?”

She tried to put pressure on Gu Ning with the influence of her family.

“I don’t care who you are, but you better give up the idea of attacking me,” said Gu Ning. Gu Ning knew that the girl was from a powerful family, but she couldn’t care less about it. After all, she wasn’t afraid of Rong Zechen either.

“Really? I’m curious to know what you can do to fight back!” The girl looked very unkind. She was determined to teach Gu Ning a lesson.

“Ranran, calm down.” Rong Zechen warned her at once, but didn’t show much anger. It seemed that he also hoped Min Ranran could scare Gu Ning a little.

Min Ranran was from a first-rate rich family in the capital, but the Rong family enjoyed a much higher social status than her family.

However, Gu Ning didn’t bother to pay much attention to Min Ranran. She never wanted to be involved in trouble. If it was possible, she would avoid having grudges with people of power, but she wouldn’t hesitate to defend herself if it was unavoidable.

“Zechen, she’s really hateful!” Min Ranran complained. She wouldn’t give up the idea of teaching Gu Ning a lesson just because of Rong Zechen’s warning. She wanted to cause Gu Ning trouble, not only for Rong Zechen, but because she also disliked Gu Ning.

“Alright, let’s go now!” Since Gu Ning had put it so frankly, Rong Zechen was unwilling to waste more time here. Actually, he didn’t want to see Gu Ning at all right now. Afterwards, he turned around walking away, leaving Min Ranran behind.

“Zechen!” Min Ranran still wanted to argue with Gu Ning, but Rong Zechen already walked away. As a result, she had to leave after giving Gu Ning a glare. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Gu Ning went back to her seat later.

...

Sun Xiangming got his wounds wrapped in the hospital, then told his secretary to call the police once he felt a little relieved. He didn’t think it was his fault.

In fact, he had hired a bunch of hoodlums to attack Chen Cangyi first, and Chen Cangyi simply paid him back, but Sun Xiangming blamed Chen Cangyi for his injuries.

However, the surveillance cameras along the road were already hacked, so there was no evidence. In that case, it was impossible for him to punish Chen Cangyi unless he used some dirty tricks.

However, if he dared to do that, he would only suffer more.

...

At 11 pm, Gu Ning went back home before her friends.

Although a lot of activities started after 11 pm, Gu Ning didn’t have much interest in bars. She only went out to gather with her friends for a while.

Tang Qingyang and the others didn’t leave right away, but they didn’t stop Gu Ning and her bodyguards from leaving.

The next morning, Gu Ning went for a run and met Baili Zongyang and Baili Zongxue on her way. Because it was a weekend, Baili Zongxue went back to Century City too.

“Gu Ning, are you free today? If you are, why don’t we shop together?” Baili Zongxue said to Gu Ning.

“Sorry, I’m busy these days. I have a lot to deal with in the company.” Gu Ning declined. It was actually a lie, but she had decided to cultivate in the siheyuan. She hadn’t practiced for a long time, so she was a little anxious.

Chu Peihan and her friends asked her whether she was free for a gathering yesterday afternoon, but Gu Ning turned them down. If they were willing to come here to have some fun with her, they were welcome at any time. Gu Ning would arrange for Gao Yi or Qiao Ya to open the door for them.

“Fine!” Since she said that, Baili Zongxue didn’t insist. She understood that Gu Ning was very busy.

After running, Gu Ning went to have breakfast. She rested for a while, then avoided the rush hour and left for the siheyuan.

Although it was a weekend, there was still a lot of traffic on the road. Most white-collar workers didn’t have weekends. Only public servants could be free on the weekends.

Before Gu Ning left her home, she called Jing Yunyao and asked her whether she wanted to go to the siheyuan with her. After all, Jing Yunyao was always alone at home, so Gu Ning was worried that she might feel bored.

However, Jing Yunyao didn’t feel bored, because she got into some hobbies recently. She could hang out with Yunyao, cultivate, go to the manor to trim the plants, or visit the Ye family.

Because of Jing Yunyao’s special status, she reached an agreement with the Leng family that they would keep it a secret that she was still alive. It was enough that members of the Leng family were aware of it. Therefore, she tried to avoid showing up before those who were familiar with the Leng family in case the secret was exposed.

Jing Yunyao also planned to visit Shangguan Yang at the siheyuan today, so she agreed. Therefore, Gu Ning went to pick up Jing Yunyao before going to the siheyuan.

Jing Yunyao was at a very high level as a cultivator, but she needed to reach a higher level. Accordingly, once they arrived at the siheyuan, Gu Ning went to practice on her own, while Shangguan Yang taught Jing Yunyao how to improve herself.
