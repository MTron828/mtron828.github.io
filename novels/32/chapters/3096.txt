3099 Don’t Even Have Phone Number

“Given the current situation, we definitely trust you, Miss Leng,” Mr. An said. He wasn’t suspicious of Leng Xiaoyao. Even if it wasn’t successful, he wouldn’t blame her for that.

If anything went wrong, they wouldn’t ask Leng Xiaoyao to take the responsibility. After all, she helped them out of kindness, but if Leng Xiaoyao wanted to harm An Chenmeng, they wouldn’t let her get away with it.

“Um, is the medicine very bitter?” Upon hearing that she needed to take the herbal medicine, she was reluctant to do it because she heard herbal medicines were very bitter.

“Good medicines are always bitter. You can pinch your nose and drink it in one gulp. Do you want to be so sick for a long time?” Mrs. An said. She had taken herbal medicines before, so she knew the bitterness, but health was more important in her eyes, so she could stand it.

“Right, the National College Entrance Examination is around the corner. If you don’t take the medicine, you won’t be able to recover before a month, whereas if you take the medicine, you can make a full recovery within a week. Didn’t you say you want to study in the same university as me? If you don’t get better quickly, how can you review and be as good as me at studying?” Leng Xiaoyao said, deliberately challenging An Chenmeng.

“I didn’t say I won’t take it. I know it’s just a little bitter. It won’t kill me.” An Chenmeng accepted the challenge. She didn’t want them to look down on her, so she acted brave.

“Alright, go take a shower now,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Oh, sure.” An Chenmeng answered, then turned around and walked into the bathroom.

“Oh, do I need to leave?” Mr. An asked.

Because An Chenmeng needed to take a shower, he thought he shouldn’t stay here. Although An Chenmeng would do it in the bathroom, he felt he should leave.

“No need,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She understood Mr. An’s worries, but it was really unnecessary.

In that case, Mr. An stayed.

After that, An Chenmeng went to take a shower and Leng Xiaoyao began to draw a Taoist talisman.

However, she needed to mix the cinnabar with water.

Leng Xiaoyao bought cinnabar power, so she needed a bowl and a little water.

Without delay, Mr. An brought a bowl and water over. Leng Xiaoyao made a mixture, then began to draw.

Leng Xiaoyao drew quickly on the yellow paper. The others couldn’t see light red light on the Taoist talisman, because they weren’t cultivators.

After drawing the talisman, Leng Xiaoyao folded it to a triangle, then she used a red thread and threaded the talisman. An Chenmeng could now wear it.

“Is that enough?” Mrs. An asked.

“Yes. When Chenmeng comes out later, she can wear it for three days, then she’ll be fine. You’ll see its effect tonight,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Mr. An and the others were curious, and looked forward to seeing the result.

If it wasn’t useful, they wouldn’t blame Leng Xiaoyao. After all, Leng Xiaoyao helped them because she was kind.

And if it was useful, they would be extremely grateful to Leng Xiaoyao.

Before long, An Chenmeng finished showering. Mrs. An gave her clean clothing. After changing, An Chenmeng dried her hair with a hairdryer, then walked out.

“Come here, put this on.” Leng Xiaoyao handed the Taoist magic figure to An Chenmeng.

“No problem.” An Chenmeng didn’t ask much about it and directly put it on. “Will I be fine with it?”

“Yeah, but you need to wear it for three days. So don’t lose it, and don’t touch water with it,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“I know,” An Chenmeng said.

“You can have this jade pendant, but don’t wear it until you can remove the Taoist magic figure. You should just put it away for now,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She had already gotten rid of the evil power within the jade pendant.

“Thanks.” An Chenmeng answered, taking the jade pendant. She put it in the case on the dressing table. Since Leng Xiaoyao told her not to wear it, she definitely wouldn’t put it on right away.

“Alright, you can boil this herbal medicine on your own. Take it once in the morning and evening. Whether you’re getting better or not, take it for a week,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Of course, thank you so much, Miss Leng.” Mr. An and Mrs. An thanked her.

“You can thank me after Chenmeng has made a full recovery. If it isn’t helping, feel free to let me know,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She understood that they wouldn’t fully trust her before An Chenmeng had made a full recovery. Anyway, since they turned to her for help, they had to believe that she wouldn’t hurt An Chenmeng.

They believed she had no bad intention, but that didn’t mean they believed that she had the abilities to handle it.

After it was done, Leng Xiaoyao and Shen Xiyin left.

“Will you leave just like that?” An Chenmeng asked. She felt it was a little strange when Leng Xiaoyao quickly left after only staying in her home for a short time.

“What do you want me to do?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Why don’t you stay for dinner?” An Chenmeng offered.

Upon hearing An Chenmeng’s words, Mrs. An agreed, “If you have nothing to do, you can stay for dinner!”

She sincerely wanted them to stay, but if they had something to deal with, Mrs. An wouldn’t force them to stay. However, if they were free, Mrs. An hoped that they could stay for dinner before leaving.

“No need, I told my grandpa that I’ll eat at home. I only have time on the weekends, so I can’t disappoint him. After Chenmeng has made a full recovery, we’ll come and visit you again. Then I might stay with you for longer,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“I also need to finish my work. When I’m free, I’ll come to see you!” Shen Xiyin said. She wasn’t very busy, but she didn’t want to stay there alone.

“If so, we can’t keep you. Come to see us when you have time,” Mrs. An said.

An Chenmeng was disappointed, but could understand, so she didn’t insist that they stay.

After that, Leng Xiaoyao and Shen Xiyin left.

“Um, Miss Leng, why don’t you drive? You can drive to your home first. Then I’ll drive to my home later,” Shen Xiyin said. She was still in shock.

“No problem!” Leng Xiaoyao also needed to talk with Shen Xiyin about something, so she didn’t refuse. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After Leng Xiaoyao and Shen Xiyin left, An Chenmeng suddenly realized something wasn’t right. She gave a shout and scared her parents. They thought she was feeling uncomfortable, so they immediately asked, “Mengmeng, what’s wrong?”

“Didn’t Leng Xiaoyao say she sees me as a friend? But we didn’t exchange phone numbers or WeChat accounts!” An Chenmeng exclaimed.
