Chapter 1873: Robbers

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Actually, Master Leng cared about Leng Shaoming too, but Leng Shaoming hadn’t figured out a better way to get along with him, so only Jiang Shuyuan believed that Master Leng cared more about Leng Shaoting than Leng Shaoming.

Leng Shaoming knew that the reason was that he couldn’t get along well with Master Leng. Whenever he talked with his grandfather, he always felt uneasy, but Leng Shaoting wouldn’t.

Even though he knew the reason, he still lost his balance.

During the meal, Jiang Shuyuan had a difficult time and didn’t have any appetite.

...

Once the meal was over, Jiang Shuyuan’s family went to see Leng Shaojia.

Leng Shaojia was in a much better condition now. Her waist wasn’t aching, but she had suffered a lot after being tortured by the pain for a few months. Therefore, she needed a few more months to make a full recovery.

Gu Ning also hoped that Leng Shaojia could learn to behave herself after this drama, and that Leng Yuanqian’s family would also learn to be quiet.

Even though they disliked Leng Shaoting, Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao, they were a family after all. As long as there wasn’t a bitter grudge, Gu Ning preferred not to argue with them for Master Leng’s sake.

Master Leng was aging and he hoped to have a harmonious family.

After Jiang Shuyuan’s family left, Master Leng sighed, shaking his head, then he said to Jing Yunyao, “Yunyao, please forgive Shuyuan. Don’t take her attitude seriously.”

Master Leng witnessed Jiang Shuyuan’s attitude and behavior so he explained it to Jing Yunyao in case she was bothered.

Given Jiang Shuyuan’s attitude, he gave up hope that she could get along with Jing Yunyao. It would be fine as long as they didn’t argue against each other.

“Father, I know. It’s fine. As long as she doesn’t cause me trouble, I don’t care about her attitude,” said Jing Yunyao considerately.

“Great, great.” Master Leng understood that Jing Yunyao was very considerate, and he felt relieved after hearing her response.

Leng Shaoting, Gu Ning, and Jing Yunyao left at 9:30 pm. They didn’t drive Jing Yunyao to Mountain River Garden, but went to deal with something together.

“What is it?” asked Jing Yunyao.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t bother to keep it secret, so they told her the truth.

Because Jing Yunyao regained her memories, she knew the Shen family.

“Well, the Shen family is really greedy! I knew it was ambitious 16 years ago,” said Jing Yunyao in annoyance. She never had a good impression of the Shen family.

“The Shen family is only the Leng family’s relatives. It’s fine if it’s unwilling to be loyal to the Leng family, but it has gained much help from the Leng family during the past years given its relationship with the Leng family. In outsiders’ eyes, the Shen family is very close to the Leng family, so what the Shen family is secretly doing will definitely affect the Leng family. Anyway, since we already know its secret, we must do something,” said Leng Shaoting, otherwise the Leng family wouldn’t bother to pay special attention to the Shen family.

“Of course, we must solve the problem as soon as possible,” said Jing Yunyao.

The abandoned warehouse at XX Road in Haicheng District was a little far from the city center. It was about three kilometers to go in from the road that branched off the main road, and there was no one in a radius of four to five hundred meters around the abandoned warehouse.

As they approached the abandoned warehouse, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see whether there was anyone inside. Although it was only 10:30 pm which wasn’t the time of their deal, they might have arrived earlier.

Therefore, they didn’t drive over until they were sure that there was nobody.

Although the car was large, Gu Ning had her telepathic eye space and Leng Shaoting also had the Qiankun Bag, so it was very easy for them to hide the car.

When they reached the front of the abandoned warehouse, they got out of the car and put the car into Leng Shaoting’s Qiankun Bag before walking into the warehouse together.

It was a single warehouse about seven hundred square meters large.

In the warehouse, there was a pile of useless goods, so Gu Ning, Leng Shaoting, and Jiang Yunyao went to hide themselves behind it and waited for their target.

In the meantime, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see outside so that she could know they were coming once they showed up.

Before hearing the voices, Gu Ning saw a car coming. Only Leng Shaoting was aware of Gu Ning’s Jade Eyes while Jing Yunyao didn’t know about it, so Gu Ning said nothing.

When the car was about five hundred meters away, Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao sensed it too.

In order not to expose their identities, Gu Ning took out three masks from her telepathic eye space and told them to put it on.

First came a MPV with five people inside. One of them was the strange man sitting with Shen Yanfeng that Gu Ning saw in the Shengshi Hotel yesterday.

On the back seats of the car, there were two big boxes filled with guns.

The car stopped in front of the abandoned warehouse, then a few people got out of it. They didn’t enter the warehouse, but waited outside.

Gu Ning and the others didn’t plan to wait for the other group of people to come, because their purpose was just to steal the goods.

Because Shen Yanfeng was still absent, they naturally wouldn’t be able to obtain evidence that this incident was directly related to Shen Yanfeng.

Yuan Wenrui told them yesterday that he would arrange for some people to come here, which meant that he wouldn’t come himself.

Therefore, Gu Ning and the others seized the chance and took action before Yuan Wenrui’s people came.

Three figures flashed over like lightning. Before those men could realize what was happening, they already reached them.

“Who are you?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The five men were scared by their sudden appearance.

“Robbers!” said Gu Ning and attacked them right away.

Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao were busy beating them, while Leng Shaoting would drive the car out of their sight. After that, he would put the boxes of guns into his Qiankun Bag and finish the fight as quickly as possible.

He couldn’t put the stuff into his Qiankun Bag right in front of them, or his secret would be exposed.

“The car!”

The several men were shocked, trying to stop Leng Shaoting, but Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao blocked their way.

These men were good at fighting, but were barely comparable to Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao. They were too weak for them, so they easily beat them within seconds.

Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao only beat them unconscious, but didn’t disable or kill them. Afterwards, they threw them into the weeds 20 meters away so that the second group of people who came later couldn’t find them.

After solving the problem, Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao went to the direction in which Leng Shaoting drove the car.

Leng Shaoting only drove the car dozens of meters away. When Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao came, Leng Shaoting had done everything and got out of it.

After that, the three of them left that location right away, but didn’t leave the place.. Instead, they went to wait in a dark corner to see what the second group of people would do later.
