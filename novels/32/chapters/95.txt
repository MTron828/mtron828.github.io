Chapter 96: Not Gay

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“No, I want to buy it myself.” Gu Ning actually had the intention to cooperate with An Guangyao, so she didn’t want to hide. She took it more seriously instead to make him feel her sincerity. “I know Mr. An doesn’t trust me because I’m so young, which is quite understandable. I am too young indeed. After all, this is a deal of a few hundred million yuan! However, since it’s a deal, we will need a lawyer to notarize it. The deal won’t be settled until the contract is signed. Therefore, it would be too expensive for me to trap you, right?”

An Guangyao stared at Gu Ning. He had no idea what to say. Although he agreed with Gu Ning on what she had said, he felt that it was so unreal.

While An Guangyao was still in the shock, Gu Ning wrote her name and number on a piece of paper beside the table. She handed it to An Guangyao. “Mr. An, this is my number. I think we probably can’t talk too much since the time is limited right now, but I do hope you can make your decision after we talk further about this. I’m free this noon and afternoon.”

An Guangyao took the paper. “Sure, I’ll consider it.”

Actually, An Guangyao had been convinced already. The other buyers had all given him a very low price. He would lose a lot of money if he agreed to sell his company to them.

The moment that Gu Ning finished her talk with An Guangyao, Hao Ran and Qin Zixun came downstairs. Then they left for their school.

When Gu Ning and others were gone, An Guangyao immediately went to An Yi’s room to check on his wounds. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

An Guangyao wanted to ask An Yi about Gu Ning, but gave it up at the end.

Although Gu Ning and her friends would tell their head teacher what had happened to An Yi with proof from the infirmary, An Yi’s father still called An Yi’s head teacher himself.

When Gu Ning got back home that night, she found her family were all unhappy. She was then told that her third uncle, Gu Qinyang, and his family would be back to City F this Friday. He even asked to have a meal with them the day after tomorrow.

Gu Qinyang didn’t live in City F, but City G.

Both Gu Qinyang and his wife worked in a national department. They lived a good life with a monthly wage of a dozen thousand yuan. Otherwise, they couldn’t buy a house in City G, which was a second-tier city. They had even bought a second house the other day. Their housing fund could cover the house mortgage, and they didn’t have to worry about the money at all.

Gu Man already had broken off the connection with her mother and Lin Lijuan, so she wasn’t willing to go have a meal with them, but it was Gu Qinyang who invited her, so it wasn’t appropriate if she didn’t show up.

Although they weren’t intimate, they were brother and sister after all. They hadn’t done anything bad to Gu Man, even though they had never helped her either.

Gu Ning didn’t express her opinion. It was all up to Gu Man.

At the end, Gu Man agreed. Therefore, Gu Ning decided to go to City G on Saturday.

She knew that those people in the Gu Family didn’t want to see her, but she was worried about Gu Man.

Although Gu Qing and Jiang Xu would be there as well, both of them were a little weak. If there was any argument, they wouldn’t be able help at all.

Gu Ning didn’t remember that she still had to give the gun back to Leng Shaoting until she was about to go to bed. Although she was reluctant to do that, she had to fulfill her promise.

She had to give it back anyway, so she decided to give it back earlier.

Thus she sent a message to Leng Shaoting, and told him to wait for her at the gate of zone G at 5 am in the morning. She would give the gun back to him then. If he was late, she would leave directly.

Alright, Gu Ning admitted she purposely set such an early time. If he wanted the gun, then he had to be patient.

However, when Leng Shaoting received the message, he wasn’t in City F, so he could only send a message back asking for a rain check.

Gu Ning was speechless. She typed and sent: I want to give it back to you, but you’re absent. I think the gun doesn’t want to go back to you at all. Why don’t you leave it with me?

She didn’t know whether Leng Shaoting had seen her message or not, because he didn’t reply any more.

The next day, Gu Ning walked out of zone G.

Xu Jinchen was in a sport suit, and “accidentally” ran over from the other side towards Gu Ning. He met Gu Ning with a surprised face. “Oh, it’s you! What a coincidence! Are you going to school now?” he asked.

It wasn’t a coincidence at all. Xu Jinchen actually did it on purpose.

“Yes, are you running at such an early time?”

Although Gu Ning barely knew him, she greeted him friendly, given that he had helped her.

“Yeah. Do you live here too? I live in zone C, and we’re neighbors. Oh, what’s your name by the way? I’m Xu Jinchen,” the man asked, although he came to Gu Ning for a reason.

“I’m Gu Ning,” Gu Ning replied.

“Nice to meet you. Can I ask you a question? What’s your relationship with Shaoting? Please don’t get me wrong. I’m simply curious about that. I grew up with Shaoting, and I work with him now. I have never seen him being with a girl before.” Xu Jinchen didn’t bother to hide.

Had never been with a girl?

Gu Ning was shocked at first, but then she understood it. Leng Shaoting was such a cold man. There properly wasn’t any woman who wasn’t afraid of him.

Even Gu Ning felt stressed in front of him.

Because Gu Ning had a little disagreement with Leng Shaoting, she said, “Maybe he is gay. I barely know him. We have just met for several times, so there is nothing between us.”

Gay?

Hearing that, Xu Jinchen was astonished for a second then snorted with laughter, “Ha-ha, ha-ha, we thought the same thing before, but I promise you Shaoting is definitely not gay.”

“Oh, have you tried?” Gu Ning put on an evil face.

Xu Jinchen immediately understood, and argued, “Nonsense! I have never ever done that! I like women.”

Gu Ning shrugged. “Maybe, he only likes himself!”

“Ha-ha, you’re so funny.” Xu Jinchen laughed again. “Yeah, maybe you’re right. He is in love with himself.”

After a while, Gu Ning said, “Sorry, I have to leave for my classes.”

“Oh, right.” Xu Jinchen didn’t want to bother her any longer.

However, he didn’t believe that there was nothing going on between Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. Otherwise, why had Leng Shaoting come to meet her so early in the morning?

Maybe Leng Shaoting was still chasing her!
