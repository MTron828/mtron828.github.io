Although she was much calmer than Leng Yecheng, she was also very happy. It was a large amount of money! It was impossible for them not to be happy after winning so much money.

After all, it was a fortune for Leng Xiaoyao.

Seven times, eight times…

Leng Yecheng felt a little dizzy because of his excitement. It was incredible!

“Sell it now!” Leng Xiaoyao said. Then she started selling the stocks. Leng Yecheng followed without hesitation.

Many investors saw the high prices of the stocks, so they immediately competed to buy the stocks.

Leng Xiaoyao and Leng Yecheng sold all the stocks. They didn’t care whether it was the highest point, but the stocks would quickly go down after reaching the prices of the beginning value.

Leng Yecheng invested twelve million yuan and made almost a hundred million yuan.

Leng Xiaoyao invested forty million yuan and made about three hundred million yuan. She had also invested twenty million yuan in other companies, whose stocks went up comparatively slowly.

Even if the stocks went up comparatively slowly, she still made a lot of money.

Looking at the number, Leng Yecheng was still extremely surprised. After he came back to his senses, he still couldn’t believe his eyes. “A-A-Am I in a dream? Did I just make a hundred million yuan?”

It was too unbelievable!

“You’re not in a dream. It’s real.” Leng Xiaoyao laughed.

“How much did you invest? How much did you make?” Leng Yecheng asked Leng Xiaoyao. He didn’t think she had much money, so the investment couldn’t be big.

Therefore, Leng Yecheng was full of regrets. He should have given her more money, so that she could make a better investment.

Anyway, it was over, and it was too late to regret it. Therefore, Leng Yecheng decided to share the money with Leng Xiaoyao fifty-fifty. After all, they relied on Leng Xiaoyao to make a fortune.

“I invested forty million yuan, and I made about three hundred million yuan.” Leng Xiaoyao was very honest. It was necessary for her to prove her abilities, otherwise Leng Yecheng wouldn’t believe in her.

After all, she was going to start up a business, so she must let her family know about her abilities. Therefore, they would trust her and wouldn’t interfere in her business.

“W-What?” Leng Yecheng was shocked.

She had invested forty million yuan and made three hundred million yuan?

Where did Leng Xiaoyao get so much money?

And three hundred million yuan was too much!

Jesus, was he really not in a dream?

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t interrupt him. She only looked at him with a grin till he came back to his senses.

After a long while, Leng Yecheng was finally sure that it was real, but it was still hard for him to digest.

“Yaoyao, did you say you invested forty million yuan and made three hundred million yuan? When did you get so much money?” Leng Yecheng asked. He was curious to know how Leng Xiaoyao got the forty million yuan, but he didn’t think she managed to do it inappropriately.

Since Leng Xiaoyao told him that she had invested forty million yuan, she didn’t plan to keep the source a secret.

Therefore, she said, “I didn’t tell you because I didn’t want you to be worried, but now I think it’s time to tell you that. I went to Fengyun Casino one day and made twenty million yuan…”

“What? You went to Fengyun Casino and made twenty million yuan?” Upon hearing that, Leng Yecheng interrupted Leng Xiaoyao in amazement.

He couldn’t believe that Leng Xiaoyao went to gamble in Fengyun Casino and won twenty million yuan. It was amazing!

Why didn’t Ji Yanxi tell him?

Obviously, Leng Xiaoyao stopped Ji Yanxi from doing that.

“Yeah, and they didn’t want me to go with so much money. So they asked me to gamble with them. I agreed. Then I met Han Yu. After they heard that I’m your niece, they didn’t cause me any trouble, but Ji Yanxi begged me to not go there very often. They don’t want me to win too much money, otherwise they can’t run the casino,” Leng Xiaoyao said, shrugging with a resigned look.

“Ha-ha.”

Leng Yecheng snorted with laughter. Upon thinking that Ji Yanxi begged Leng Xiaoyao not to go there very often and to win less money, he felt it was amusing.

Although Leng Yecheng was very surprised that Leng Xiaoyao went to gamble in a casino and made a lot of money, he wasn’t too worried since he saw that she was fine. However, he still reminded her to be careful. “Casinos are dangerous. Luckily, you met someone who’s familiar with me, otherwise you might have been in serious trouble. Don’t go to casinos again.”

“Sure, I understand.”

However, it was impossible for her not to go to casinos again. Anyway, she agreed obediently in order to not worry Leng Yecheng.

“And next?” After Leng Yecheng almost digested the shocking news, he asked once more. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“By accident, I learned that Han Yu had a hidden injury. It’s something you don’t know. For the sake of your friendship, I proposed to heal him. After it was done, he gave me fifty million yuan to thank me. Just like that, I had made a lot of money,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t tell Leng Yecheng that she asked for fifty million yuan because Han Yu used him to threaten her. After all, Han Yu was a good friend, so she didn’t want to ruin their friendship.

“What? Fifty million yuan? That’s too much!” Leng Yecheng was surprised again. He was surprised by the amount of the money instead of the fact that Leng Xiaoyao had healed Han Yu.

He recovered quickly because Leng Xiaoyao helped him, so he believed that she had that ability.

“Fifty million yuan is nothing for Han Yu. There is no need to be so surprised. Don’t forget I’m your niece!” Leng Xiaoyao said, acting angry.

“I know, I know.” Leng Yecheng immediately comforted Leng Xiaoyao. Even if Leng Yecheng thought it was too much, Leng Xiaoyao already got the money.

“And, please keep it a secret, because I told him not to tell you about it,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t want Leng Yecheng to know something that he shouldn’t know.

“Fine, I can keep it a secret.” Leng Yecheng would listen to Leng Xiaoyao no matter what she said right now. If Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want him to tell anyone, he wouldn’t.

“Jesus, we made five hundred million yuan so easily! It can buy three companies the size of Fengshang Design.” Leng Yecheng still couldn’t believe it.

If Leng Yehua’s family heard that, they would definitely be jealous and angry.
