Chapter 502 A Fight in a Seafood Restaurant

Since Mu Ke was hungry too, he invited Yu Mixi to share night snacks with him, Yu Mixi didn’t reject this time, so the two went out together.

Gu Ning and her friends, on the other hand, went to a seafood restaurant later. All of them loved eating seafood.

The seafood restaurant was quite popular and crowded. When Gu Ning and her friends arrived, there was only one vacant table left. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

However, after they had just been seated, several men at the next table leered at Gu Ning and Chu Peihan. They even discussed them loudly in public.

“Look at the two beautiful young girls!”

“I’m curious what their bodies look like.”

“You can find out by undressing them!”

“Ha-ha! You’re right.”

Hearing them sexually teasing Gu Ning and Chu Peihan, Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping were mad, but when Hao Ran was about to beat them, Gu Ning stopped him by a glance.

Gu Ning and Chu Peihan were also furious, but they had their own plan. Chu Peihan of course would make those men pay for what they had said, but she wasn’t willing to punch them in the restaurant, because the owner of this restaurant was innocent. Gu Ning thought that the men hadn’t made it clear enough that they were talking about them. If they beat them just because of that, it would seem impulsive and unreasonable.

Nevertheless, Gu Ning knew that the men wouldn’t stop, so she would have a chance or an acceptable reason to teach them a lesson. Gu Ning was right. Before long, a man stood up and walked to them, leering at Gu Ning and Chu Peihan.

“Hey, girls, why don’t you come to our table and have some fun with us?”

Without Gu Ning’s permission, Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping had to tolerate it no matter how furious they were now.

The man then turned to Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping. “Hey, dudes, these two girls are yours right? They’re pretty, and we would love to have some fun with them.”

Hearing that, the sleazy men around the next table laughed out loud.

Other people in the restaurant had sympathy for Gu Ning and her friends, but none of them dared to help them.

Hao Ran turned to look at Gu Ning again, asking for her permission in silence.

All of a sudden, Gu Ning wore an alluring smile, which stunned everyone around, even Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping were impressed by her beauty. Gu Ning said gently, “I love a man who can fight. If the four of you can beat the two of them, we’ll leave here with you.”

Hao Ran and Zhan Tianping immediately realized that Gu Ning was setting a trap for them, so they were less mad and prepared to beat them down later.

In order to show their “sincerity” Chu Peihan added, “Exactly, if they can’t protect us today, we don’t need them anymore.”

The four men were excited, because the only thing they were good at was fighting. In addition, they were four men, while Hao Ran and Zhan Tianping were teenagers, so they believed that they could easily win. Therefore, even before they began to fight, the four men seemed very proud and confident. Other people in the restaurant had the same idea.

“No problem, let’s have a fight,” the man said, then turned to look at Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping. “Do you dare?”

“Of course!” Hao Ran said without delay.

However, they, of course, wouldn’t have the fight in the restaurant. Before they left, they paid the bill first.

“Young girl, they aren’t good guys!” the owner of this restaurant said to Gu Ning.

“Don’t worry. We’ll be fine,” Gu Ning said, then walked to the outside.

They found an empty ground and the two groups stood across from each other. Many people stood a distance away from them watching the fight. However, almost all the onlookers believed that the two boys would lose.

“Let’s begin!”

Once Gu Ning said that the fight began, the two groups started to attack each other.

Although the four men were good at fighting compared with ordinary people, Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping weren’t weak either. Especially after being trained by Gu Ning, they easily beat the four men down within several minutes. Everyone was surprised by the result. To their astonishment, the two boys were able to quickly beat the four men down.

“How dare you offend our boss! You’re a bunch of losers!”

“I’ll punch the sh*t out of you!”

“Let me teach you a lesson!”

The four men were shouting in great pain on the ground. They didn’t expect that the two boys were well-trained and could easily beat them down. If they had known that the two boys were so excellent at fighting, they would never have dared to annoy them.

“I’m sorry! Please let us go!”

“We’ll never do it again!”

Those men were simply paper tigers, and easily yielded to those who were stronger than them.

“Ha? Do you think that we’ll let you get away with it? In your dream!” Hao Ran didn’t stop beating and kicking them heavily. Even though they apologized and begged them, Hao and Zhao Tianping had no intention to let them go. Of course, they wouldn’t beat them to death either, but they taught them a brutal lesson.

After the fight, Gu Ning and the others went back to the seafood restaurant to enjoy their night snack. All of them were in a good mood and ate a lot. They were so full that they didn’t want to walk at all, and simply wanted to lie down on the road. Gu Ning wasn’t included, because she restricted herself to not eating too much at night.

When they were back in the hotel, they fell asleep quickly, because they still had work to do tomorrow.
