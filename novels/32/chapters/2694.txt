Chapter 2695: The Story of the Man in White

Hearing that, the man in white got mad. He turned to glare at Gu Ning, but Leng Shaoting protected her behind him, so he couldn’t see her.

“How do you know?” asked the man in white. He was about to lose temper.

He was suspicious of them for getting into the chamber without his permission, but he was always here. How could they have gotten in? How could she know?

Right after Gu Ning asked that question, she realized she shouldn’t have said that, because she needed to explain it and then her secret would be exposed. If she didn’t tell the truth, she honestly didn’t know how to explain it.

Most importantly, Gu Ning had mentioned many of the details of the ice coffin.

Unfortunately, it was too late and she couldn’t take her words back, so she could only be honest. “Because I have a pair of Jade Eyes and I can see what’s behind the wall. That’s how we found this chamber.”

It wouldn’t be a big deal if the man in white heard about her secret, because he wouldn’t spread it and no one would believe it.

Hearing that, the man in white was astonished. Jade Eyes?

Although it was the first time that he had ever heard about that, he understood what it was from Gu Ning’s explanation. With Jade Eyes, she could see through any obstacles.

However, Gu Ning observed his place without his permission, which still displeased him because he felt his privacy was invaded.

Gu Ning understood that, so she apologized before the man in white lost temper. “I’m sorry for observing the chamber without your permission, but I didn’t know whether you were friendly, so I needed to know more about the situation. Please forgive me.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

When Gu Ning apologized, she moved out from behind Leng Shaoting and met his eyes, showing obvious sincerity on her face.

In fact, Gu Ning purposely met the eyes of the man in white at this moment. She knew she closely resembled the woman he loved, so she hoped his anger would go away after seeing her face.

......

Although she didn’t know what had happened between them, this man was a very affectionate man since he stayed here for over a thousand years to guard his love. Therefore, Gu Ning didn’t want to ruin the peace. In other words, she didn’t want to have conflict with this man.

Upon seeing Gu Ning’s face which greatly resembled his love’s face, the man in white indeed calmed down.

A few seconds later, he moved his eyes away from her. Even though she greatly resembled Shen Er, she wasn’t Shen Er so he wouldn’t pay much attention to her.

“Right, I’m talking about the woman in the ice coffin.” The man in white replied. After that, he told them his story. “Shen Er is a disciple of a cultivation sect, while I’m a disciple of the demon clan. The cultivation sect and the demon clan once had a battle. Shen Er was injured, and I rescued her. We secretly ran away. After getting along for a while, we fell in love and got together.”

“We knew that we’re forbidden to be together, because the good and the evil factions were bitter enemies. But I had never hurt any innocent people even though I was born in the demon clan. Even when the good and the evil factions were in a battle, I did nothing. In order not to be discovered, we hid far away and lived an ordinary life, but Shen Er was still found by other disciples in the same cultivation sect as her. They directly attacked me for no reason just because I was a demon…”

“They said they represented the good, but their hands were covered in blood. I was a demon, but I had never hurt any innocent people. Is it my fault that I was born in the demon clan? Do I have to be killed even though I did nothing wrong?”

Saying that, the man in white got emotional.

“Shen Er and I ran all the way till here. But she was seriously injured because of me. She died several days later, so I put her in this ice coffin. Her body is kept well, and we can be together forever,” said the man in white.

Knowing that, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting had sympathy for him. Actually, they never thought that the so-called good cultivators were all good people with a sense of justice. For example, officials in the government also bullied ordinary citizens. Corrupt public servants were very hateful.

After the man in white finished, he realized that he had said too much, but he had kept it to himself for too long. Nobody listened to him before, and now he had the chance to tell his story.

“I’m done. What else do you want to know? If not, you can leave now,” said the man in white.

“I want to know why you’ll die once you leave this cave?” asked Gu Ning. The man in white only told them the result, but didn’t tell them the reason, so Gu Ning felt it was necessary to make it clear.

“Because Shen Er’s master found us in this cave, and he felt touched by my love for Shen Er, he allowed me to stay here with Shen Er, but in order to stop me from hurting innocent people, he sealed my soul in this cave. Once I leave this cave, my body will separate from my soul and I will die,” said the man in white.

Even though Shen Er’s master didn’t kill him and allowed him to stay with Shen Er, he didn’t feel grateful to Shen Er’s master at all. If it hadn’t been for them, Shen Er wouldn’t have died.

Seal?

Leng Shaoting immediately sensed around and really sensed a Taoist magic figure.

Although Leng Shaoting didn’t know much about Taoist magic figures, Shangguan Yang was an expert and he had seen Taoist magic figures many times before. Therefore, he could sense them, but couldn’t tell what Taoist magic figure it was.

He didn’t use his magical senses earlier, so he didn’t feel it till now.

In that case, Leng Shaoting believed the man’s words.

“If so, we won’t bother you any longer,” said Leng Shaoting, then he held Gu Ning’s hand and walked away.

…

The sky was dark now, but it wasn’t completely dark.

The others thought that Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning could quickly come out, but they had been inside for an hour. It worried them and they were afraid that they might have encountered trouble.

Only Xu Jinchen and Zhan Zhiyin were calm, because they knew Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning could protect themselves.
