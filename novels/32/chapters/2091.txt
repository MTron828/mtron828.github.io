Chapter 2094: Apologize Face to Face

“Liwen, I’m really sorry, but can you give me some time to ask Miaomiao about that? Can I call you back after we talk about that with his father?” said Du Meiling.

“Sure, I can wait.” Du Liwen understood she needed time to ask Chen Fangmiao and talk about it with Chen Fangmiao’s father before replying to him.

After hanging up the call with Du Liwen, Du Meiling called his husband.

“Hengsheng, when will you be home?” Once her husband answered her call, Du Meiling asked in panic.

Du Meiling’s husband, Chen Hengsheng, noticed it and asked with a frown, “I’m in the parking lot now. What happened?”

“Come home, and we’ll talk about it then,” said Du Meiling.

“Fine,” said Chen Hengsheng and hung up the call.

After ten minutes, Chen Hengsheng was home. Before he could ask, Du Meiling told him everything in detail.

Because they needed to deal with it right, she couldn’t hide any details.

“What? Chen Fangmiao tried to kill Du Jialei?”

Knowing what had happened, Chen Hengsheng was scared too. To his surprise, Chen Fangmiao dared to do such a thing.

It was illegal to kill people. Although Du Jialei was fine, it was still attempted murder!

No matter what, Chen Fangmiao indeed had tried to kill. Therefore, it was totally unacceptable.

“Miaomiao didn’t mean to do it.” Du Meiling understood it was wrong, but still defended her son. Anyway, her voice was filled with panic.

“Idiots! It’s not enough to explain his unacceptable behavior. Even if he didn’t mean to do it, he did! It’s wrong. Given Du Liwen and his wife’s love for Du Jialei, they won’t swallow their anger,” said Chen Hengsheng in annoyance.

Du Meiling knew it as well, but it already happened, so she only hoped that her son wouldn’t pay too high a price for it.

“W-What should we do now?” Du Meiling panicked more. “Do we need to let Miaomiao deny it? We can say it never happened.”

“What an idiot you are!” Chen Hengsheng was mad. His wife was indeed a stupid woman. “Do you think Du Liwen will believe that?”

Hearing that, Du Meiling closed her mouth. In the end, she asked, “What should we do then?”

“Call Chen Fangmiao back right now. I need to call Du Liwen and apologize first. We’ll visit them tomorrow with Chen Fangmiao and apologize face to face. We need to win their forgiveness, or it’ll only get worse. Although Du Liwen won’t put Miaomiao in jail, we rely on the Du family to do business, so we can’t lose their support,” said Chen Hengsheng. He was willing to abase himself for benefits, so he knew that they had to apologize right now. After all, it was Chen Fangmiao’s fault, so it was reasonable that he apologized.

However, they wouldn’t stop scheming against the Du family.

“Sure.” Du Meiling took out her phone at once to call Chen Fangmiao.

Chen Hengsheng went back to his study to call Du Liwen.

Once his call was answered, Chen Hengsheng apologized. “Liwen, I’m sorry. I didn’t expect Miaomiao to do such a crazy thing. I already told Meiling to call him back. I’ll take him to apologize to you face to face tomorrow.”

“Great, I’ll wait for your arrival at home tomorrow morning.” It was better to deal with the problem face to face, so Du Liwen was unwilling to talk too much with Chen Hengsheng on the phone. Without hesitation, he hung up on Chen Hengsheng.

Although it had nothing to do with Chen Hengsheng, Chen Hengsheng wasn’t a good man either. Du Liwen never liked him, so his attitude towards him wasn’t good.

Hearing the sound after the phone was hung up, Chen Hengsheng showed jealousy and ambition in his eyes.

Du Liwen, I’ll replace you sooner or later.

Chen Hengsheng first met Du Liwen in college, because Du Liwen’s family was very rich while he was from a very ordinary family.

Du Liwen wasn’t good at studying, but he was. However, the girl he liked still admired Du Liwen, so he was jealous of Du Liwen ever since that time.

He actually played some tricks to marry Du Meiling. Given the huge gap between his family and the Du family, it was impossible for him to marry Du Meiling if he didn’t play tricks.

And after marrying Du Meiling, his career became better. However, Chen Hengsheng didn’t feel grateful to the Du family. On the contrary, he was secretly scheming against the Du family. He was a typical ungrateful person.

As a selfish man, Chen Hengsheng didn’t think it was wrong. His ambition had already distorted his values.

…

When Chen Fangmiao heard his mother tell him to come back home, he was scared, but couldn’t say no.

After he got home, Chen Hengsheng seriously criticized him, but he didn’t dare to say a word.

Although he didn’t mean to kill Du Jialei, he indeed had taken out a knife and tried to stab him. If Gu Ning hadn’t shown up and stopped him, he could have killed Du Jialei. And if he really killed Du Jialei, he would be doomed, so he was full of fear now.

Chen Hengsheng asked him to apologize to the Du family tomorrow, and he didn’t dare to refuse. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Because they didn’t know whether Du Liwen would forgive them and continue to support them after they apologized, the three of them couldn’t sleep that night.

After they got up the next morning, they had breakfast first. They didn’t have much appetite because of what had happened between Chen Fangmiao and Du Jialei, but they needed to eat some food.

Once they finished, they set off for the Du family’s home.

On their way, Chen Hengsheng told Chen Fangmiao what he needed to do later at the Du family’s place, and Chen Fangmiao just listened to his father.

Because it was rush hour, it was a bit crowded on the road. They set off at 8 am, and arrived at the Du family’s house at 9:30 am.

Because the Du family was waiting for their arrival, the members of the Du family were all present.

Before the Chen family came, the Du family was relaxed, but the Du family’s three members suddenly became very displeased once the Chen family showed up. They all stared at Chen Hengsheng and the others coldly.
