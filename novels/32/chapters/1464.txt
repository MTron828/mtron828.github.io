Chapter 1465: I Can Put You in Jail

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

No matter what, Gu Ning made a decision to conduct an investigation.

“Shaoting, I’ll investigate it. I know you want to do the same thing, but I hope that you can focus on your cultivation first. You’re not a mortal now. If other cultivators find you, you’ll be in big trouble. We don’t know whether your mother has enemies in the cultivation world. If your mother had enemies, they definitely will attack you before you reach a high level as a cultivator,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure.” Leng Shaoting nodded. He understood Gu Ning’s concern.

“And you don’t need to blame your mother even if the dead woman isn’t her, alright?” Gu Ning said. She was worried that Leng Shaoting might be in a bad mood.

“I won’t,” Leng Shaoting said. He didn’t believe that his mother would abandon his father like that and he loved his mother deeply.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting checked the room once again before they left. They only stayed upstairs for half an hour, and no one asked them what they had done when they went back to the living room.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting stayed in the Leng family’s old house for a while longer, then left.

...

Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin’s wedding was tomorrow, and both of them were having a bachelor’s party tonight with their own friends. They enjoyed the party with wild abandon. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Gu Ning clearly knew that they would do many inappropriate things at the party, so once she walked out of the Leng family’s old house she called K and told him to find out where they were right now.

About 10 minutes later, K called Gu Ning back, and Gu Ning assigned a task to Gao Yi and Qiao Ya. She told them to spy on Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin to see what they could get on them.

Leng Shaoting knew about Gu Ning’s long-standing grudge against Tang Yaxin and Qi Ziyue, but he didn’t know that they were going to be married tomorrow and Gu Ning decided to take revenge at their wedding. In addition, Gu Ning had already told him that she would handle it on her own, so he didn’t ask further about it.

Although Leng Shaoting didn’t ask further about it, Gu Ning had no intention to keep it a secret from him. However, before she could tell him her plan, Leng Shaoting told her that he had to go back to the military base tomorrow and that he might see her again on this weekend if he could be free.

In that case, Gu Ning simply nodded and said nothing.

...

Because Baili Zongyang and his younger sister stayed in Century City, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting stayed somewhere else tonight in case they sensed Leng Shaoting’s night-luminescent pearl.

Even if Leng Shaoting didn’t have the night-luminescent pearl with him, they could still feel the air of a cultivator from him. Therefore, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting planned to go back to Leng Shaoting’s house tonight.

Although it was almost 9 pm, there was still a lot of traffic on the road.

When they passed a side gate of a university, they saw a group of young men arguing at the sidewalk near the turn of the main road ahead, and they seemed to be fighting.

Gu Ning didn’t take it seriously, because she thought that they were just a bunch of noisy university students. Nevertheless, right as Leng Shaoting drove the car towards them, a boy was suddenly pushed into the road by another boy and was about to be hit by the car.

With an abrupt halt, Leng Shaoting stopped the car 40 centimeters away from the boy. Luckily, Leng Shaoting was very agile, because if he had been a second later, the boy could have been hit.

Gu Ning was angry when she saw the scene.

No matter who pushed the boy out into the main road, they could be punished too if the boy was really hit by them. Therefore, once Leng Shaoting stopped the car, Gu Ning got out of it and went to criticize them.

“What’s wrong with you? Why did you suddenly push him into the road? What if he was hit by our car?” Gu Ning shouted at a boy who pushed the boy.

The group of boys were stunned by Gu Ning’s beauty, but they were displeased when Gu Ning criticized them. “He is fine!”

“What if he wasn’t?” Gu Ning was furious.

She stared straight at the boy. “Do you know what you’ve done? It’s an attempted murder! You could be put in jail!”

The boy, however, wasn’t scared at all. Instead, he showed obvious disdain and arrogance on his face. “Put me in jail? Do you know who I am? I’m...”

Before he could finish, Gu Ning interrupted him. “I don’t care who you are, and I can put you in jail as long as I want to do so.” Gu Ning had no respect for him.

“You...” The boy was mad and was surprised by Gu Ning’s tone.

Right when he was about to go beat Gu Ning, he looked shocked and terrified when he saw the man walking towards Gu Ning. “L-Lord Leng.”

It was obvious that he recognized Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting didn’t frequently show up in the high society, but he sometimes attended formal activities with Xu Jinchen and his other close friends, so many people had a deep impression of him.
