Chapter 1560: I Hate Her

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Dongfang Ziyu didn’t arrive at the Gufan store until 2 pm. At this time, the opening ceremony was already over a long time ago.

She was so late because she was caught in a traffic jam on the way to the airport that morning. When she finally arrived at the airport, she had to wait for a whole hour for the closest flight.

After nearly two hours of flying, she arrived at the airport of City B at 12:30 pm. She went to take a taxi later, and wasted a lot of time on the road, so she missed the opening ceremony of Gufan and failed to see Gu Ning.

Dongfang Ziyu was quite upset, but it wasn’t appropriate for her to ask the staff where Gu Ning went. She was afraid that Gu Ning might find out that she was following her all the way here. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Even though she could make an excuse to see Gu Ning, they weren’t even friends. They had only met each other once before, so it would be strange if she purposely came to City B to see Gu Ning.

Anyway, she could wait for Gu Ning’s next trip.

Right at this moment, Gu Ning booked a plane ticket to the capital, and Dongfang Ziyu soon received the news. She knew that the plane that Gu Ning was going to take would take off at 9:30 am tomorrow.

Without hesitation, Dongfang Ziyu booked a plane ticket for the same flight as Gu Ning. She decided to follow Gu Ning and go to the capital. After that, she went to have a rest in a hotel.

...

In the afternoon, Tang Yunrong and her husband came to visit the Tang family.

Gu Ning had told them that she also had prepared clothes from Gufan for their family. Therefore, they came to have dinner with the Tang family and picked up their gifts.

Tang Yunrong hadn’t seen Gu Ning for a long time, so she happily agreed to share a meal with her.

Except for Tang Jiayang who was in Country Y now, all of the other members of the Tang family gathered together that night.

...

Leng Shaoting went back to the capital in the evening, and he directly went back to the Leng family’s house to see Master Leng because Gu Ning wasn’t there.

Leng Shaojia was still in the hospital now, but luckily her condition was getting much better day by day.

Master Leng, however, was upset these days, because he learned the truth about Leng Shaojia’s sickness. He went to visit Leng Shaojia two days ago, but didn’t tell Jiang Shuyuan that he was coming, so Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia didn’t pay much attention to what they were saying.

Because Leng Shaojia had suffered a lot of pain, she hated Gu Ning more than ever.

“Why wasn’t Gu Ning killed last time? I hate her!” Leng Shaojia clenched her teeth. She wished that Gu Ning had been killed in the car accident last time.

Because she believed that Gu Ning must have found out that she was the mastermind of the car accident so she was heavily beaten because of Gu Ning too. She knew that Gu Ning purposely refused to help her. However, even though she knew that Gu Ning did that on purpose, she couldn’t do anything about it in case her dirty secret was exposed.

Actually, if Gu Ning hadn’t stopped Leng Shaoting, Leng Shaoting would have disabled Leng Shaojia early on.

Leng Shaojia knew it very well, so she only dared to curse at Gu Ning behind her back.

Unfortunately, she didn’t know that Master Leng was listening to their conversation outside the ward.

Master Leng was totally shocked when he heard that. He didn’t know what Leng Shaojia was talking about, but he had a feeling that it was something serious.

Master Leng was an old man of great wisdom, and he soon realized that Leng Shaojia must have schemed against Gu Ning before. As a result, Gu Ning had heavily beaten Leng Shaojia.

In that case, he understood why Gu Ning refused to help Leng Shaojia.

Master Leng was full of anger once he figured out the truth. However, Gu Ning said nothing about it for his sake.

Master Leng curbed his anger and forced himself to calm down so that he could hear what Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia were going to talk about.

“Alright, stop cursing her. What if other people find it out?” Jiang Shuyuan stopped Leng Shaojia.

“I just hate her!” Leng Shaojia said. “No one will know.”
