3144 Accessible

“Nothing? How is that possible?”

Mo Jingxuan and the others didn’t believe it.

“Right, if there is nothing between you, why did you let her get so close to you? And you weren’t mad at all when she threatened you. She even said you’re her support earlier!”

Because Xiao Yuzhe was too excited, he said everything Leng Xiaoyao had said to him.

!!

However, the moment he said it aloud, he realized he shouldn’t have done that. However, it was too late. Mo Jingxuan and Zhai Yunxiao gave him a glare at the same time.

Xiao Yuzhe was causing them trouble! Leng Xiaoyao didn’t say anything. Why did he say it aloud?

Li Mochen frowned and asked, “Earlier? What happened?”

Did Leng Xiaoyao say he was her support?

He could accept that.

“Um, nothing…” Xiao Yuzhe said at once, but he was guilty in front of Li Mochen.

“Tell me.” Li Mochen lowered his voice and ordered.

Obviously, something happened. Although he understood Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t be hurt, he still wanted to know.

Once Li Mochen became serious, Xiao Yuzhe didn’t dare to keep it a secret. Therefore, he said, “Um, when we walked out earlier, we saw Leng Xiaoyao. We thought that she was beautiful and elegant and complimented her for a while. Yunxiao said she isn’t accessible, but I wanted to try. So we went to strike up a conversation with her, but unexpectedly Leng Xiaoyao had already heard our conversation. She directly pointed it out and asked Jinxuan whether he knew you. After knowing that you’re familiar, Jinxuan admitted that he also knew you. Then Leng Xiaoyao said you’re her support and she would let you teach us a lesson for her, but I’ve apologized to her for my behavior. She forgave me…”

When Xiao Yuzhe almost finished, he was really worried that Li Mochen would teach them a lesson for Leng Xiaoyao. He immediately added that Leng Xiaoyao already forgave him.

Li Mochen wouldn’t bother to punish them for that. It wasn’t a big deal anyway, so he gave a little response, then said nothing. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xiao Yuzhe and the others thought they were going to be criticized, but Li Mochen didn’t seem mad. They understood that he wouldn’t punish them for that, so they felt relieved.

They didn’t think Li Mochen was mean and they would be punished, but their behavior had indeed been unacceptable.

Therefore, if Li Mochen had been there, whether he had a relationship with Leng Xiaoyao or not, he wouldn’t allow them to do that even if it was a stranger.

After Leng Xiaoyao succeeded in striking up a conversation with them, some girls started trying as well, but only Mo Jingxuan socialized with them perfunctorily. The other men didn’t even give them a glance.

Normally, Mo Jingxuan had no interest in doing that, but it was the Mo family’s party, so he had to behave himself.

If the girls who tried to strike up a conversation with them were well-mannered, he would be polite to them. If they weren’t, he wouldn’t bother to be nice to them.

Although many girls wanted to strike up a conversation with them, they understood that they shouldn’t mess with them. Therefore, most girls who walked over to strike up a conversation with them were well-mannered, they quietly walked away when Mo Jingxuan and the other men had interest in them.

On the other hand, Mo Jingxuan and his friends would be patient with businessmen and officials who came to chat with them. However, they didn’t talk much and only exchanged courtesies.

Right after Leng Xiaoyao walked away from Li Mochen, some guests came to strike up a conversation with her. Men wanted to know her, while women targeted Li Mochen.

If those men had good manners, Leng Xiaoyao would be polite to them. If they didn’t, Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t hesitate to argue with them.

“Miss, nice to see you, I was born in the Qin family. My name is Qin Qianhui. May I know your family and your name?” asked a woman who was about twenty-four years old. She seemed polite, but Leng Xiaoyao easily saw through her. She was simply acting.

Anyway, since she was polite, Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t be rude and politely replied. “My family is the Leng family. My name is Leng Xiaoyao.”

“Oh, you’re the ugly Leng Xiaoyao who’s a good-for-nothing with freckles all over her face?” Qin Qianhui was surprised. Because Leng Xiaoyao’s deeds weren’t a secret in high society, many people had heard about her.

After saying that, Qin Qianhui realized she shouldn’t have said that. She immediately apologized. “I’m sorry, I just blurted it out, but I didn’t mean it. I didn’t expect you to be so beautiful!”

She hadn’t succeeded in striking up a conversation with Leng Xiaoyao yet, so she couldn’t offend her right now.

“It’s fine. You merely told the truth, I just put on make-up this time,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t care about it at all.

“Um, do you have a relationship with Mr. Mo and his friends?” Qin Qianhui asked.

“Yeah, we just met,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“What? You just met? Are they accessible?” Qin Qianhui asked.

If they were, she would go to strike up a conversation with them. She was worried that they weren’t accessible, and she would be embarrassed if they ignored her.

“I think they’re very accessible,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t purposely say that to mislead Qin Qianhui after knowing Qin Qianhui’s purpose, but in her eyes, they were indeed easy to get along with.

Qin Qianhui’s face lit up at once. She couldn’t wait to strike up a conversation with them right now. “Thank you so much. See you later.”

Leng Xiaoyao nodded, then Qin Qianhui quickly walked away. She didn’t go to Mo Jingxuan and the others right away, because she didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to see it and mock her. She deliberately walked to the other side first.

Although she thought she disguised it very well, Leng Xiaoyao actually already knew her purpose when she asked whether she had a relationship with Mr. Mo. Honestly, Leng Xiaoyao had no interest in Qin Qianhui’s plan.

Before long, Qin Qianhui went to strike up a conversation with Mo Jingxuan, but Mo Jingxuan showed little interest in her, which filled her with displeasure. She even blamed Leng Xiaoyao for that and thought Leng Xiaoyao wanted to make her a joke, but on second thought, Leng Xiaoyao indeed had talked with them for a while earlier, so they should be accessible to Leng Xiaoyao.

Therefore, Qin Qianhui didn’t go to question her.
