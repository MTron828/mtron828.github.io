Chapter 1578: Punished by Gods

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“If you stay in the mortals’ world, it’s against the rules and you’ll be punished by the gods,” Gu Ning said.

“So what? I’ve stayed here for a long time, and nothing has happened,” the male ghost said, and didn’t think it was a big deal. It had heard of the punishment from the gods, but had never witnessed it before, so it had doubts about it. In addition, even if it really existed, it hadn’t encountered it yet. Anyway, it was unwilling to leave right now. Instead, it decided to live its life by following its heart this time.

Thinking of that, the male ghost looked more determined.

“What do you want to do here?” Gu Ning asked.

“To improve my cultivation without doubt, because there is thick magical power,” said the male ghost and showed great ambition in its eyes.

It wanted to have a normal body to live in, and it had a chance to live like an ordinary person if it was able to reach a high level.

“It’s not easy,” Gu Ning said. In fact, it took years for a ghost to obtain a real body to live in by improving its cultivation with magical power.

Gu Ning didn’t think that this male ghost had patience for it. Besides, it carried heavy grudges, so it was impossible for it to only do the right things.

“I want to give it a try,” said the male ghost.

“Are you sure?” Gu Ning asked.

“Yes, I’m sure.” The male ghost nodded, and it felt slightly annoyed that Gu Ning kept asking it questions like that.

“Fine, I’m afraid I can’t stop your right now,” Gu Ning said and took out a porcelain bottle from her telepathic eye space. “Since fate brought us together, I can help you if you really want to improve your cultivation. This is a bottle of magical power crystals, that you can take if you want.”

Gu Ning opened the porcelain bottle in case the male ghost didn’t believe her.

Once it was opened, the male ghost smelt the pure, thick magical power and its eyes lit up.

“Thank you so much!” The male ghost was thrilled.

It was fully attracted to the magical power crystals, so it didn’t think further about why Gu Ning did that.

It reached out its hands to take the bottle. However, right when its hands were about to touch the porcelain bottle, the porcelain bottle disappeared and Gu Ning caught its hands the next second.

The male ghost was scared, but it was already put back into Gu Ning’s telepathic eye space again.

The porcelain bottle was simply a bait.

Gu Ning brought this male ghost out, so she shouldn’t allow it to stay here after she knew what it planned to do.

If the male ghost was unwilling to tell her his obsession, she could only purify it with the help of her telepathic eye space. It was also possible that she would tell the flood dragon to destroy it one day in the future.

Gu Ning sighed after she put the male ghost back in her telepathic eye space, then she walked back.

When she got back to the Kunlun Temple, it was already past 12 am.

Leng Shaoting was still waiting for Gu Ning in the yard. Because he didn’t know where Gu Ning went and when she would come back, he stayed in the same place waiting for her. He was worried about Gu Ning, and hoped that she would be fine.

The flood dragon was absent at this moment, because Leng Shaoting felt uneasy when it was with him.

The flood dragon understood that Leng Shaoting wasn’t weak, so it left once he finished his practice. Nevertheless, the flood dragon didn’t go far, but stayed in a corner of the yard. It was curious to know the latest condition of the snow lotus.

“My master, how is it?” asked the flood dragon once it saw Gu Ning.

“I didn’t catch it, but I’ll search for it later,” Gu Ning said.

It wasn’t a surprising result.

The flood dragon trusted Gu Ning, and didn’t think that she was lying. It had known Gu Ning for a long time, and knew Gu Ning very well.

Even if Gu Ning wouldn’t share the snow lotus being with it, she would still give it something else as reward. In addition, Gu Ning indeed failed to catch the snow lotus today.

After that, the flood dragon left and Gu Ning walked into the temple. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Ningning, are you alright?” Leng Shaoting walked towards her at once.

“Why don’t you go into the room? It’s cold outside,” Gu Ning asked. She knew that Leng Shaoting stayed in the yard because he was worried about her, but she hoped that he would take good care of himself too.

“I was worried about you,” said Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning smiled and they went into the room together.

Afterwards, Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting what she had gone through with the snow lotus being.
