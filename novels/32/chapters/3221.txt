3222 What Do You Think?

Because Leng Xiaoyao had become beautiful, many boys wrote a love letter for her, but Leng Xiaoyao rejected them. If they left the love letters in her desk drawer, she would directly throw them into the trash can.

Afterwards, there were rumors about Leng Xiaoyao, saying that Leng Xiaoyao was cold and made those boys lose face and that she had hurt their dignity.

However, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care.

It bothered her when they wrote love letters for her and yet they even blamed her for rejecting them and throwing their love letters away?

Did she have to accept them no matter who confessed affection for her?

If she did, they would criticize her for being disloyal, cheap, and disgusting.

When Leng Xiaoyao and her friends went to eat at the canteen, they heard several girls in front of them talking about Leng Xiaoyao.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t care about that, but An Chenmeng and the other girls couldn’t stand it. They went ahead and argued with those girls. “Does Leng Xiaoyao have to accept every boy who confesses to her? If so, Leng Xiaoyao will have countless boyfriends. Wouldn’t you criticize her for being disloyal then?”

Xiong Manxin questioned. “Right, if someone you don’t like confesses to you, will you accept him? And you? How about you?”

All the girls she asked shook their heads.

“Since you all wouldn’t accept that, why do you criticize Xiaoyao for doing the same thing?” Wu Minmin said.

“B-But you can’t throw their love letters into the trash can right in front of their faces!” One girl argued. She felt that it was rude.

At this time, Leng Xiaoyao opened her mouth. “If you write a love letter to the boy you have feelings for and he accepts it, would you think that he’s also interested in you? Would you think that you can be boyfriend and girlfriend?”

Leng Xiaoyao spoke in a flat tone. She wasn’t mad and didn’t scold them. She simply asked them several questions.

Those girls thought for a while, then nodded. “You’re right.”

It was true that they would think the boy they liked was also interested in them if he accepted their love letter.

Once Leng Xiaoyao asked them those questions, they understood her meaning.

“So, since I have no interest in them, why should I let them misunderstand me? Isn’t that more hateful? Only calculating girls prefer to be chased by a group of boys. They won’t say yes or no. When they feel upset, they’ll complain to the boys, but once they’re happy, they won’t pay attention to the boys. All the boys are only their plan-B. Don’t you think that’s disgusting?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

They thought that it was reasonable, so those girls said nothing.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to make it difficult for them, so she walked away with An Chenmeng and the other girls. The onlookers began to discuss it when they were gone.

“I think Leng Xiaoyao is right. Since she has no interest in them, she shouldn’t give those boys a misunderstanding or a chance.”

“Right, otherwise it would be even more hateful. It’s better that she directly rejects them.”

“…”

In a blink of an eye, the due date for He Fangqi to pay reached the last day. He returned the money on time, because he didn’t dare not to do it!

After two days of listening to Old Mrs. Wang and Wang Xiangyang’s calls, Leng Xiaoyao got the evidence.

Wang Xiangyang lost a hundred thousand yuan when he went to gamble with his friends at a casino a while ago. He borrowed the money from his friend and his friend was urging him to pay it back. He had no money, so he had to turn to Old Mrs. Wang for help and asked her to get the money from Wang Yiming. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Old Mrs. Wang was mad when she heard that.

She was aware that Wang Xiangyang had a bad habit of gambling. She had tried to persuade him to stop, but Wang Xiangyang wouldn’t listen.

Luckily, Wang Xiangyang won more often than he lost, so she could only turn a blind eye on that.

Unexpectedly, he lost a hundred thousand yuan this time.

A hundred thousand yuan was a sky-high price for her!

Old Mrs. Wang was mad. “Didn’t I tell you not to gamble? Why did you go to the casino again? How can we pay back so much money?”

“I just wanted to win a fortune! I didn’t expect to lose.” Wang Xiangyang was irritated too. He had good luck before that. He didn’t know that he would suddenly lose so much money!

“Who can become rich by gambling?” Old Mrs. Wang said in anger. She knew that it was highly likely to lose money by gambling.

“Why? I know several people who became rich by gambling. And those famous gamblers rely on gambling to make money. Each of them make tens of millions of yuan,” Wang Xiangyang retorted. He saw that many people had won a lot of money by gambling, so he thought that he could win too.

Becoming one of the people who could become rich by gambling was his goal.

“Do you have the ability?” Old Mrs. Wang said. She rarely rained on Wang Xiangyang’s parade, but this time she was extremely angry at him.

“Are you my mother or not? Why won’t you encourage me? Anyway, I already owe them a lot of money. I can’t do anything about it now. Go ask Wang Yiming for the money. Isn’t he going to receive the compensation for his car? His car cost him two hundred thousand yuan, so he should get a compensation of two hundred thousand yuan at least. It shouldn’t be a problem to give me a hundred thousand yuan,” Wang Xiangyang said, taking it for granted that he would give him the money.

He always took it for granted, as if Wang Yiming owed him. Whenever he needed anything, he turned to Wang Yiming for help, thinking that Wang Yiming should agree. If not, it was Wang Yiming’s fault.

“You…” Old Mrs. Wang was furious. Upon thinking that she needed to ask Wang Yiming for a hundred thousand yuan, she didn’t know how to do that.

“Your uncle said that we can’t ask for too much from Wang Yiming. If he’s hurt deeply by us, he won’t help us again,” Old Mrs. Wang said, feeling that it would be difficult. However, if she didn’t ask Wang Yiming for money, she was afraid that Wang Xiangyang would be in trouble.

“I don’t care about that right now. Who knows what will happen in the future? He isn’t your biological son, so why do you care about him so much? Anyway, as long as he doesn’t know that you’re not his biological mother, he won’t abandon you no matter how much you hurt him. If I don’t return the money, they’ll beat me. If I’m beaten to death, you will have no son,” Wang Xiangyang said furiously.

“Is it so serious? They’ll beat you if you don’t pay them back?” Old Mrs. Wang was scared and her face turned pale.

“Those men are gangsters. They’re unreasonable!” Wang Xiangyang said impatiently. He only dared to bully the weak like Old Mrs. Wang and Wang Yiming. He didn’t dare to be aggressive outside.

Especially when he hung out with those gangsters, he had to please them carefully.

Although he was afraid of them, he still enjoyed hanging out with them because he loved the excitement.
