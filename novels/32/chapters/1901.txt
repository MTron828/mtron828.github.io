Chapter 1902: Impolite Attitude

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After the heavy hit, the pain made Sun Xiangming almost faint, and he couldn’t even moan aloud.

Although the chauffeur and secretary weren’t beaten, they didn’t dare to save Sun Xiangming, because they knew it was useless. What was worse, they could also be hurt.

After breaking Sun Xiangming’s legs, those people stopped and immediately left, because their purpose was to break his legs.

Once those people left, Sun Xiangming’s chauffeur quickly drove straight towards the hospital.

Although the car was seriously smashed, it could still drive.

...

After the task was completed, those people reported it to Tian. Tian then told Qian Dongliang about it, and Qian Dongliang talked to Chen Cangyi afterwards. The second Chen Cangyi got the news, he shared it with Gu Ning..

At this time, Gu Ning was already in Song Nan’s bar.

Most of the people at the table were familiar faces, including Tang Qingyang, Xu Qinyin, Gu Anna and two friends of Tang Qingyang.

Tang Qingyang met these two friends abroad, but they were both from the capital. They had just returned a few days ago, and it was also today that Tang Qingyang had time to entertain them.

The situation Tang Qingyang was in was no longer dangerous, so Ba Tianyang’s mission had been completed and he went back to the company a few days ago.

Song Nan was also here. As the boss, Song Nan rarely came, because he owned more than one business. However, he usually showed up when his good friends visited. In addition, he had to be free.

All of a sudden, Gu Ning’s phone rang. Because the bar was a bit noisy, she got up and went to the washroom to answer the call.

Knowing that Sun Xiangming had a broken leg, Gu Ning put on a smile of satisfaction. Now that it was settled, she decided to move on.

She didn’t doubt whether it was true, because it was very easy for her to discover the truth. As a result, they didn’t need to lie to her, because it would just cause trouble for themselves.

Nonetheless, Gu Ning still asked Chen Cangyi to investigate the surveillance cameras along the section of road where Sun Xiangming was beaten. After confirming it, he directly hacked the surveillance cameras to prevent Sun Xiangming from obtaining evidence.

Even though they weren’t the ones who beat Sun Xiangming, they were connected. In order to avoid unnecessary involvement and trouble, it was better to ruin the surveillance videos.

After Gu Ning hung up the call with Chen Cangyi, she walked out of the washroom and ran into Rong Zechen right outside.

Rong Zechen’s face was slightly red with blurred eyes, which obviously showed that he was drunk.

Seeing Gu Ning, Rong Zechen was a little surprised, a little happy, and a little annoyed. Their argument left a scar in his heart.

When Gu Ning saw Rong Zechen, she had no special feelings. Because she had said that they should be strangers, she only gave him a glance, then withdrew her sight and left.

Rong Zechen, however, was unwilling to accept that. “Gu Ning, wait a second!” He shouted at Gu Ning’s back.

Hearing his voice, Gu Ning stopped. Although she decided to treat him as a stranger if they met again, there was no need for her to harbor a grudge against him. Therefore, she couldn’t ignore it when Rong Zechen called her. After all, she didn’t want to hear more rumors about her, which would make things difficult for her.

Anyway, she couldn’t trust Rong Zechen’s character right now.

“Senior Rong, may I help?” Gu Ning turned around and asked him with an indifferent attitude. She didn’t do it on purpose, but it was her real attitude towards Rong Zechen.

“Can we have a talk?” Rong Zechen asked.

“Sure,” said Gu Ning.

There weren’t many people around them, so Rong Zechen didn’t bother to walk away. “I heard you have a fiancé. Is it true?”

He had actually doubted whether it was just an excuse Gu Ning made up to get rid of the misunderstanding.

“It’s true,” said Gu Ning with a serious expression, because it was indeed the truth.

Hearing that, Rong Zechen looked upset. “Is he really outstanding?”

“Of course,” said Gu Ning. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You...” Rong Zechen opened his mouth again, trying to say something, but didn’t say it aloud. Hesitating, he didn’t know whether he should say it aloud.

“Senior Rong, if there isn’t anything else I can help with, I need to leave now”. Gu Ning had no patience with him. Accordingly, once she finished, she turned around to walk away.

“Wait a moment!” Rong Zechen stopped her again, and Gu Ning paused.

“I-I just want to know. Don’t you like me at all?” Rong Zechen asked.

Hearing that, Gu Ning frowned with a resigned look. She didn’t know why Rong Zechen was so confident and believed that she might like him. They had only met each other a few times, and didn’t talk much with one another.

Rong Zechen was quite popular in the school, but Gu Ning had no interest in him. Besides, he tried to form a relationship with her on his own initiative, but Gu Ning was very cold to him, which embarrassed him with disappointment.

“Senior Rong, I know there are a lot of your admirers in our school, but different people have different preferences. Although most girls like you, it doesn’t mean every girl will like you. We’ve only met each other a few times, and we don’t talk much with one another. I seriously have no idea why you think that I might like you,” said Gu Ning. She sounded a little impolite, but it was necessary in order to get rid of Rong Zechen.

Gu Ning already had a fiancé and she was loyal to him. Except for her fiancé, she had no interest in men.

Before Gu Ning could say anything else, an unkind female voice sounded nearby them. “Well, even if you like Zechen, Zechen might not choose you. Do you know how influential his family is? Zechen is the heir of the Rong family in the capital. Have you heard of the Rong family? It’s a top family in our country. Not everyone can be accepted by it.”

The girl was at the same age as Gu Ning. She was pretty, but looked quite mean. The tone when she spoke also proved her self-centered character. She was merely a spoiled, arrogant rich heiress.

Rong Zechen didn’t interrupt the girl, because he wanted to see Gu Ning’s reaction after knowing his status.

Gu Ning saw through Rong Zechen, so she had a worse impression of him.

No matter what, she and Rong Zechen were meant to have no social intercourse.

“Miss, what’s wrong with your comprehension? I’ve made it very clear that I don’t like Senior Rong. I’m aware that he’s a member of the Rong family, but so what? I value one’s abilities above his family background. I don’t think a really outstanding man needs to show off his family background to prove himself,” said Gu Ning.
