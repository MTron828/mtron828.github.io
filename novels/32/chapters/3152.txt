3153 How Do You Dare to Trap Me

Huang Junyan’s father came later, and asked Huang Junyan to apologize after knowing what had happened.

Normally, he would turn a blind eye to Huang Junyan, as long as she didn’t suffer any losses, but if she caused serious trouble, he would ask her to give in. In public, he didn’t allow his kids to embarrass their family. However, he couldn’t prevent them from doing that when he was absent.

Huang Junyan realized that she couldn’t get away from it upon hearing her father’s angry words. Therefore, she immediately turned to apologize to Leng Xiaoyao. “Miss Leng, I’m sorry.”

“I accept your apology, Miss Huang. So, it’s over,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Since Huang Junyan apologized, she wouldn’t make it more difficult for her.

She couldn’t let other people think that she was easy to bully, but she didn’t want to leave a bad impression on them either. After all, she cared about the Leng family’s reputation.

Therefore, everyone didn’t think Leng Xiaoyao was wrong. She only wanted an apology and didn’t ask more than that.

“Apologize to Miss Leng right now!” Mr. Shi understood that if Mrs. Shi didn’t apologize to Leng Xiaoyao, it would cause a scene. It wouldn’t do the Shi family any good in the end, so they had to yield no matter how reluctant they were to do so.

Mrs. Shi didn’t want to do that, but she had to give in after her husband asked her to.

As a result, Mrs. Shi apologized to Leng Xiaoyao unwillingly. “Miss Leng, I’m sorry. I was too impulsive earlier.”

“Alright, since Mrs. Shi apologized, I can get over it, but Mrs. Shi, the Shi family is a famous rich family in City Chang, so you should behave yourself in the future,” Leng Xiaoyao advised. She wasn’t reminding Mrs. Shi out of kindness, instead she did it simply to make fun of her.

Mrs. Shi understood that very well. She wanted to retort, but still curbed her anger.

“Miss Leng, please delete the video. If you upload it to the Internet, we can sue you because it’s illegal,” Mr. Shi said threateningly.

Because Mrs. Shi apologized, he wouldn’t allow it to become a scene.

“Chairman Shi, don’t worry, I actually don’t have a recording at all,” Leng Xiaoyao said with a smile.

Upon hearing that, Mr. Shi and Mrs. Shi felt they had been trapped by Leng Xiaoyao. “How dare you trap me?!”

“If not, you wouldn’t have admitted your mistake.” Leng Xiaoyao teased.

“You…” Mrs. Shi was mad. She wanted to say something else, but her husband gave her a warning look, so she closed her mouth.

Mr. Shi was also angry, but they couldn’t argue further about that, so they had to tolerate it.

After that, Leng Xiaoyao supported Leng Changyuan and walked out of the crowd to the other side. A while later, the crowd dispersed.

Although the drama happened, the party wasn’t affected and they continued to socialize with other guests. Because these things often happened at parties, everyone was used to it.

Shi Yuran left earlier because her clothing was dirty. Huang Junyan also left due to her bad mood.

Leng Yuqi understood that Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t easy to bully, but she was still displeased when Leng Xiaoyao didn’t suffer any losses at all.

Especially since Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng were so protective of Leng Xiaoyao. She was extremely jealous.

Leng Yehua and Song Meiyu were also unhappy.

In the past, Song Meiyu would have criticized Leng Xiaoyao right after Mr. Shi opened his mouth. She would deliberately scold Leng Xiaoyao as an elder and criticize her for being rude and unreasonable, but now Song Meiyu didn’t dare to say that, because she couldn’t win if she went against Leng Xiaoyao right now. She might only embarrass herself instead.

Mo Jinbei’s parents didn’t know about it until after it was settled. They didn’t think it was a big deal, because Mo Jinbei wasn’t the troublemaker, but they had to admit that Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t simple.

Other girls might tolerate it and be quiet.

Even if they didn’t tolerate it, they wouldn’t be able to make the Shi family and the Huang family apologize.

Mo Jingxuan and the others didn’t know about it until a long while later, so they were slightly annoyed.

They regretted not staying in the living hall, since Mo Jinbei and her friends wouldn’t have dared to cause Leng Xiaoyao trouble if they were there.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t suffer any losses, but it was unpleasant to encounter such trouble.

After the drama happened, Leng Xiaoyao became famous in high society, but this time, everyone had a better impression of her. She had become pretty and strong.

Only those who were jealous of Leng Xiaoyao disliked her, while the other people had a good impression of her.

Many people were aware of Leng Xiaoyao’s engagement with Chu Jianan, but few knew that their engagement had already ended.

In the past, they had felt sympathy for Chu Jianan because he had to marry a stupid, mean, and ugly girl. None of them thought Leng Xiaoyao deserved Chu Jianan, but now they felt Chu Jianan didn’t deserve Leng Xiaoyao instead. Honestly, Leng Xiaoyao was a lot more attractive than Chu Jianan.

As for their family background, Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t comparable to Chu Jianan, but she had powerful connections.

Therefore, they believed it shouldn’t be difficult for Leng Xiaoyao to find a better man than Chu Jianan.

Leng Yecheng heard their discussions and walked over. “I bet you don’t know yet. Last month, Yaoyao ended her engagement with Chu Jianan. As for the reason, I think you all know that Chu Jianan never liked Yaoyao. If so, there is no need for them to be together. After ending the engagement, Yaoyao made up her mind to study hard and better herself. Now I don’t think Chu Jianan deserves her, so please don’t connect Yaoyao with Chu Jianan again.”

Leng Yecheng said that Leng Xiaoyao changed after ending their engagement because he didn’t want people to think that Leng Xiaoyao dumped Chu Jianan after she became different. Whether she disdained Chu Jianan or Chu Jianan disdained her, it was easier to arouse people’s sympathy by saying that she was the victim.
