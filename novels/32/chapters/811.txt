813 Cousin-in-law

Tang Haifeng walked out at once when he heard that Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning came. He also focused on Leng Shaoting after simply welcoming Gu Ning. Gu Ning didn’t think that it was a bad thing, but wasn’t used to it yet. Before, they would surround her the moment she showed up, but now Leng Shaoting became the focus of their attention.

“Shaoting, why don’t you play chess with me?” Tang Haifeng proposed.

“Sure,” Leng Shaoting agreed, then went to play chess with Tang Haifeng.

“I know that you’re good at chess, so you must play to the best of your ability,” Tang Haifeng said. He didn’t want to win the game just because he was Gu Ning’s grandfather.

Tang Yunfan wasn’t as good at chess as Leng Shaoting was, so Tang Haifeng thought that he had finally met a match, and he wanted to enjoy the game.

“I will, grandpa,” Leng Shaoting said.

In the beginning, Tang Haifeng and Leng Shaoting were at the same level, then Leng Shaoting got the advantage and won by a narrow margin.

“Very good!” Tang Haifeng wasn’t displeased at all, but enjoyed himself, because it wasn’t easy for him to find a match. When he played chess with his friends, normally one held a distinct advantage over another. It wasn’t fun at all, because they would know the result even before the game began.

Jiang Lihua told Leng Shaoting to stay for dinner, but Gu Ning said that they had to leave to meet their friends. She also told them that Leng Shaoting directly came to visit them once he got off the plane.

The members of the Tang family felt quite touched, and liked Leng Shaoting more.

When it was about 6 pm, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting left, because Leng Shaoting and his comrades were going to fulfill their task tonight.

Gu Ning wouldn’t ask further about Leng Shaoting’s task, because she knew that it was highly confidential.

The moment they walked out of the door, they met Tang Yunfan who just came home. Seeing Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting, he was a little surprised. He was happy to see Gu Ning, but soon put on a serious face when his sight fell on Leng Shaoting. It wasn’t because he disliked Leng Shaoting, but because he was Gu Ning’s father. He was strict with Leng Shaoting so that Leng Shaoting would take Gu Ning seriously. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Nice to see you, Mr. Tang,” Leng Shaoting said politely.

“Hi, dad,” Gu Ning said.

“It’s dinner time. Where are you going?” Tang Yunfan asked.

“We have an appointment with our friends, so we’re going to meet them,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Oh, great.”

Since they already had an appointment with their friends, Tang Yunfan wouldn’t force them to stay there. He also said to Gu Ning when he walked by them, “Don’t come to pick your mother up tonight.”

“Ha-ha.” Gu Ning snorted with laughter.

Tang Yunfan felt slightly embarrassed being laughed at by his own daughter, but pretended that nothing had happened and walked inside.

Afterwards, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting got in their car and drove away.

Leng Shaoting was a little sad that he couldn’t stay with Gu Ning tonight. It wasn’t easy for them to share some private time.

On the way, Gu Ning’s phone rang, and the caller was K.

“Boss, I just found some evidence of the Mu family’s illegal actions. If I’m going to pay the Mu family back, will the Tang family help them?” K asked. K made up his mind to get revenge on the Mu family, but he had to ask for Gu Ning’s opinion given the Mu family’s relationship with the Tang family.

“I already told my grandpa, and the Tang family won’t be involved. Do whatever you want to do,” Gu Ning said.

“Great!” K was relieved.

After hanging up with K, Gu Ning received a call from An Guangyao.

“Uncle An, have you arrived?” Gu Ning asked.

“Boss, the plane was delayed today, so we only arrived at City B now. It isn’t early, so we plan to have dinner first, and check the land tomorrow,” An Guangyao said.

It was an important construction project, so An Guangyao came here in person.

Shenghua Real Estate had many ongoing construction projects right now, including the living area in City F, Zhengyang Street in City D and the headquarters in the capital.

It took time for them to hire people, and they were short-staffed right now. Because of that, they had to cooperate with other construction companies, and Gu Ning directly turned to a real estate company under the Tanghuang Group for help. An Guangyao would strike a deal with the company on his own, and Gu Ning wouldn’t be involved. Gu Ning would only get involved when it was necessary.

“How many people do you have?” Gu Ning asked.

“Eight in total,” An Guangyao said. They came to check the land this time, and the construction would begin after a thorough plan was made.

“You can eat and stay in the Jinlin Hotel. I’m on my way there to meet my friends as well. See you then,” Gu Ning said.

Although she didn’t know much about construction, she should meet An Guangyao since he was already here. In addition, the land they were going to develop didn’t have a good reputation, and Gu Ning had to remind An Guangyao to figure out a way to face the rumors.

“Sure,” An Guangyao replied.

Around a dozen minutes later, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting arrived at Jinlin Hotel. Right at this moment, Xin Bei and Cao Wenxin walked over hand in hand.

Gu Ning stopped and stared at them with interest.

When Cao Wenxin noticed Gu Ning, she drew her hand out from Xin Bei’s at once, and flushed red.

“Hi, my dear Cousin Wenxin and my Cousin-in-law Bei,” Gu Ning joked.

Hearing that, Xin Bei beamed with happiness, but Cao Wenxin felt shy and argued, “He’s not your cousin-in-law yet!”
