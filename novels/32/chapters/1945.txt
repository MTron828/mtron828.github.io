Chapter 1947: Don’t Worry

These enemy states might have felt cocky about possessing evil creatures like mutants and vampires, but now that they had discovered cultivators in their homeland, who could do magic and fly, they were bound to feel intimidated and had to do something about the threat.

Since Jing Yunyao had resided in the mortal world for over 20 years, she knew about the political situation. She also knew that Country R and Country M were bound to take action once they learned of cultivators’ existence. Otherwise, they would pose great danger.

“Country R and Country M were never on good terms with us and often tried to intimidate us. How could a mighty country like ours be afraid of them? No matter what it is, we simply don’t get along with each other,” said Leng Shaoting. “Although I have killed the vampires who know of the existence of cultivators, we can’t be sure if the leaders of Country M already know about this. Even if they were unaware, Country R is bound to share the intel considering how close both countries are. Since they are unsure how powerful cultivators are, they would undoubtedly form an alliance. They always like to pull stunts like that.”

“Since some things are unavoidable, don’t try to handle them on your own. Just tell your mother and me. We can be of great help when the time comes,” said Shangguan Yang. Leng Shaoting was a soldier and it was his job to defend the nation, so they could not selfishly force him to turn a blind eye on the mortal world for the sake of his well being.

“Okay,” acknowledged Leng Shaoting.

“Even though there are rules in the cultivation world that bars a cultivator from getting involved in the mortal world and hurting a mortal, an exception can be made when our country is in danger,” said Jing Yunyao. Although she had left the cultivation world for 20 years, the rule had been around for over 100 years and would never change.

“Then you have nothing to worry about,” said Shangguan Yang.

Cultivators were remarkably powerful, so there was nothing to fear if they got involved. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning also felt cultivators would not stand by and do nothing if something befell the country. However, they could not help feeling even more relieved hearing it from Jing Yunyao’s mouth.

They started to eat lunch around 12:00 pm, leaving after they were done.

Since Jing Yunyao was around, Gu Ning did not sit in the front passenger seat and sat in the backseat with her.

“I am going out with my friends today. Why don’t you join us?” asked Gu Ning. She was not trying to be polite and genuinely wanted Jing Yunyao to go out with her. Otherwise, Jing Yunyao might feel bored staying on her own.

“Since you are hanging out with your friends, I think I will pass. I don’t want to make you feel awkward.” Jing Yunyao did not reject her because she was uninterested, but purely out of fear the presence of an elder would make her friends feel awkward.

“They will be perfectly fine with you around. I was more worried that you would feel uncomfortable about my suggestion. If you don’t mind, then you should join us!” said Gu Ning as she held Jing Yunyao’s arm sweetly.

Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao interacted incredibly harmoniously just like friends. Since they had similar personalities, they understood each other and were tolerant towards each other.

“Okay then!” Jing Yunyao hesitated for a few seconds before she agreed. She did not feel uneasy about going, but was simply worried that Gu Ning and her friends would feel uncomfortable. Now that Gu Ning had assured her it was alright, she decided to go since she had nothing to do.

Leng Shaoting brought Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao to the commercial district as Zi Beiying wanted to check it out and go to Gufan.

Leng Shaoting left after dropping Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao there.

Since Zi Beiying had yet to arrive, the two of them walked around on their own.

Zi Beiying arrived around ten minutes later along with Xu Jinchen, Mengda, and Nan.

Before Xu Jinchen was due to head back to base, he was Zi Beiying’s chauffeur and tour guide.

Although Xu Jinchen wanted to spend time alone with Zi Beiying, she had made a date with Gu Ning, and he was not in the position to stop her. So even though he was somewhat begrudging, he came along.

After they met up, Xu Jinchen was briefly stunned when he saw Jing Yunyao. He finally greeted her uneasily after he snapped out of it, “Aunt Jing.”

This was how he used to call Jing Yunyao, but he had neither seen her in over ten years nor called her name ever since, so it felt slightly unfamiliar to him.

Fortunately, he already knew that Jing Yunyao was still alive and was simply seeing her for the first time today.

“You must be Jinchen, right?” asked Jing Yunyao. She did not recognize Xu Jinchen, but Gu Ning mentioned she was meeting Xu Jinchen and a friend of hers along with her bodyguards.

“That’s right,” replied Xu Jinchen.

“Now that you are grown up, you have become so good-looking. You were a lot shorter than your peers when you were a kid! Everyone felt it was impossible for you to be tall, but you are now over 1.8 meters tall,” said Jing Yunyao as she lamented about all the changes around.

Xu Jinchen could not help feeling moved when he realized Jing Yunyao remembered things about his childhood. “Uh huh! Girls might change a lot as they grow up, but so do guys. I only changed so much after joining the army with Shaoting.”

“Hey! What should I call her?” asked Zi Beiying as she bumped Gu Ning’s elbow. Since Jing Yunyao was an elder, it was only right for Zi Beiying to take the initiative and say hi to her.

“This is Shaoting’s mother, so you can call her Aunt Jing just like Jinchen and me,” said Gu Ning.

Zi Beiying opened her eyes widened in shock. Weren’t Leng Shaoting’s parents long dead? How could she be…

Since Gu Ning said Jing Yunyao was Leng Shaoting’s mother, she must be right. Zi Beiying composed her shock and greeted her, “Aunt Jing, how do you do?”

“Nice to meet you too.” Jing Yunyao smiled at her.

“Aunt Jing, allow me to introduce you. This is a friend of ours, Zi Beiying and these are her bodyguards, Mengda and Nan,” said Gu Ning.

After chatting briefly, they proceeded to walk off.

Life was full of coincidences. The moment they arrived at Gufan, they could sense someone staring at them. Gu Ning glanced around to see a beautiful trendy young woman whom she had never encountered before.

She was not looking at Gu Ning. Instead, she had her eyes on Zi Beiying and Xu Jinchen. Did this woman like Xu Jinchen?

Xu Jinchen and Zi Beiying were walking side by side and resembled lovers while the woman looked at them angrily. Was it not abundantly clear that she liked Xu Jinchen?
