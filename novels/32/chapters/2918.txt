2919 Lose Memories

“No, no, I didn’t. I didn’t do that.” Upon hearing that, Zhang Xianlong denied it, but he was lying.

“It’s you. It’s you!” Gu Ning said, “I’ll kill you. I’ll take revenge for myself and my daughter.”

Saying that, Gu Ning walked towards Zhang Xianlong step by step. Zhang Xianlong begged in horror. “Kemin, please let me go. You’re already dead. I’ll burn more spirit money for you…”

They were already dead, so they should let him go? Why? He was still guilty.

!!

Qin Lei couldn’t wait to tear Zhang Xianlong to pieces, but unfortunately she couldn’t touch him.

Zhang Xianlong’s words implied that he caused the death of Qin Kemin and Qin Lei.

“Tell me why you burned us to death!” Gu Ning asked.

“F-For the Qin family’s wealth.” Zhang Xianlong answered.

There was no need to ask further, because his answer told her everything. It was indeed him who burned Qin Kemin and Qin Lei to death.

Afterwards, Gu Ning took out a Taoist talisman and said something, then threw it at Qin Lei.

The moment the Taoist magic figure touched Qin Lei, her body became clear.

“Alright, it’s your time now. I should go,” Gu Ning said and immediately walked away. Qin Lei was going to kill, so she was reluctant to stay, in case she was affected.

Even though she allowed Qin Lei to kill, she didn’t care as long as she didn’t do it.

Anyway, she had killed many during these years, but those people shouldn’t live.

Qin Lei said thanks to her back.

Hearing their conversation, Zhang Xianlong, who covered his head with his arms, subconsciously raised up. At a glance, he clearly saw Qin Lei’s face and screamed in horror.

“Zhang Xianlong, did you see today’s coming? I came to take revenge,” Qin Lei said, walking towards him step by step.

“Don’t, don’t come over. No!” Zhan Xianlong trembled all over his body. Suddenly the smell of urine spread. He was so scared that he lost control of his bladder!

“Don’t come over? What did you do when I begged you not to kill my mother and me? You said that you could only take the Qin family’s wealth as your own after we were dead. How funny is that? My mother and I trusted you so much, but you burned us to death,” Qin Lei said.

“I-I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. Please forgive me. I’m begging you!” Zhang Xianlong knelt down before Qin Lei and begged.

“Let you go? That’s impossible. If I had enough time, I would really love to torture you slowly!” Qin Lei said. It would be a pleasure to watch her enemy being tortured, but she didn’t have enough time to do that.

Qin Lei raised her hand and summoned some miasma. Seeing that, Zhang Xianlong rounded his eyes in horror. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Although there was no bright light in the room, there was a small light which was turned on, so he could see it clearly.

The next moment, the miasma attacked Zhang Xianlong.

Before Zhang Xianlong could figure it out, he was attacked and felt his organs being smashed in his belly.

Afterwards, he lost consciousness. With his eyes open, he died.

When Zhang Xianlong was dead, Qin Lei still had ten seconds. She didn’t want to disappear in this room, so she walked out to the yard.

Her body quickly became transparent, then she disappeared.

Gu Ning had already gone far away.

Because it was about to be morning, Gu Ning didn’t go to stay in a hotel, but went to Huafu Hills.

She hadn’t lived there for a long time, but her house was cleaned regularly, so everything was clean.

Back in Huafu Hills.

Gu Ning went directly to bed.

She would go to the Tang family’s house when the sky was bright, then she would visit the Jiang family in the afternoon.

Although Qin Lei had already left Jiang Yutong’s body, the Jiang family was still covered in evil power. It might take a long time for the evil power to go away. During this time, the Jiang family could still be affected.

Therefore, Gu Ning decided to get rid of it that afternoon.

She went to bed at 5 am, and slept for three hours, then she got up and went to the Tang family’s house.

Zhang Xianlong’s wife woke up at the same time. When she saw Zhang Xianlong dead with his eyes open, she was struck dumb. After a long while, she finally came back to her senses and immediately called the police.

The police and a forensic expert came. The forensic expert checked Zhang Xianlong’s body. All of his organs were broken, but there were no wounds, which confused the forensic expert.

The police also thought it was tricky, because they found that all the surveillance cameras were damaged. In that case, it was impossible for them to chase the criminal.

Before long, the news spread.

…

In the Jiang family’s house.

Jiang Yutong woke up too, but she felt dizzy.

Ever since she was possessed by the ghost, she lost her mind and had no memory of what she had been doing these past few days.

Therefore, when she glanced at the date, she was shocked.

She had slept for five days! How was that possible? What happened? Did she pass out?

Jiang Yutong didn’t dare to go out until her mother came.

“Yutong, are you up?” Junior Mrs. Jiang shouted from outside the door.

“Yes!” Jiang Yutong replied. However, she found that her voice was very weak. She wanted to open the door for her mother, but found that she was weak too.

Luckily, she still had enough strength to open the door for her mother.

Once Junior Mrs. Jiang walked in and noticed that something wasn’t right with Jiang Yutong. “Yutong, are you alright? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?” she asked with concern.

“Yeah, I feel as if I’m weak. And I can’t remember what has happened these last five days. I think I lost my memories,” Jiang Yutong said.

Junior Mrs. Jiang was scared. “What? You can’t remember what happened? Yutong, do you have a fever? You looked fine these past few days, how come you suddenly lost your memories?”

Saying that, Junior Mrs. Jiang felt Jiang Yutong’s forehead with her head to see whether she had a fever, but she didn’t.

“I’ve been well these days?” Jiang Yutong was even more frightened.

If she was well these days, how could she suddenly lose her memories?

“Get changed. Let me take you to the hospital. It’s really strange that you suddenly became so weak and even lost your memories,” Junior Mrs. Jiang said as she immediately went to find clothing for Jiang Yutong to change into.
