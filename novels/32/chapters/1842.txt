Chapter 1843: Badly Want You

Leng Shaoting said casually, but Gu Ning knew his real purpose from his look. In his eyes, there was a faint sexual desire. At this moment, Gu Ning couldn’t be clearer about what he really wanted to do and she flushed in an instant.

It was a bright day, but Leng Shaoting wanted to have sex with her right now.

To be honest, Gu Ning wanted him too, because they hadn’t had sex in a long time.

There were many houses under Leng Shaoting’s name, but he often stayed in Mountain River Garden, because its location was most central and it was convenient to go in any direction from there.

Although he didn’t stay in his other houses, they were cleaned regularly. Whenever he wanted to stay in any one of his other houses, he could just choose.

Gu Ning got out of the car following Leng Shaoting, and Leng Shaoting held her hand at once walking towards the gate. He walked quite fast, running out of patience.

Gu Ning was amused and complained. “Why are you walking so fast?”

“Ningning, you’re very smart. I bet you already know the reason.” Leng Shaoting put on an evil smile, looking at Gu Ning with obvious desire.

Hearing that, a touch of embarrassment flashed on Gu Ning’s face. She pretended that she didn’t understand it. “What do you mean?”

“Really? You don’t know? Great, you’ll know soon.” Leng Shaoting didn’t bother to nail her lie. He took out the key, opened the door, closed the door after entering, then picked Gu Ning up in his arms.

“You...”

Gu Ning was taken aback by Leng Shaoting’s sudden action and gave Leng Shaoting a glare, but it wasn’t threatening at all. Instead, Leng Shaoting was distracted by her beautiful eyes. He couldn’t wait a second longer and kiss her.

They weren’t outside now, so Gu Ning didn’t stop him. She hugged his neck, kissing him back.

What they wanted right now was more than just a kiss, and they spent the following hour in bed.

Rong Zechen also went back to the school for the new semester today. As soon as he arrived, he couldn’t help but go to the military training site for the freshmen to take a look at Gu Ning.

Rong Zechen wanted to see Gu Ning not because he liked her. After all, they had only met once, but because he had a good impression of her.

However, after he came to the training field of Economics Class A and searched for a long time, he still failed to see Gu Ning.

“Are you looking for someone?” A cold male voice came from Rong Zechen’s back. Rong Zechen was startled. He immediately looked at the person and said, “Oh, hi, bro.”

“Hi,” Rong Jue replied.

It was Rong Jue who called him, and he was Rong Zechen’s older brother.

“I just came to see a friend, but she is not here,” Rong Zechen said as disappointment flashed under his eyes.

Rong Jue frowned, and asked, “Are you looking for Gu Ning?”

Although he asked that question, he already had the answer. It wasn’t because he knew that Rong Zechen and Gu Ning knew each other. It was just because this was the training field for Economics Class A, and the only absent student today was Gu Ning. It was obvious that Rong Zechen was looking for Gu Ning.

“How do you know that?” Rong Zechen widened his eyes in surprise when he heard that.

Although Rong Jue had guessed correctly that Rong Zechen came to see Gu Ning, he felt a bit uncomfortable in his heart when he saw him admit it, so his voice became a little deeper. “This is the training field of Class A of the Department of Economics. Only Gu Ning is absent today.”

“Uh, you’re right!” Rong Zechen scratched his head in embarrassment.

As for the change in Rong Jue’s attitude, Rong Zechen didn’t notice it, because Rong Jue’s temperament had always been a bit cold and it was the same for everyone.

Speaking of being cold, Rong Jue actually wasn’t as cold as Leng Shaoting, Rong Jue was more serious, while Leng Shaoting was cold from the bottom of his heart.

However, he had changed a lot after meeting Gu Ning.

“Are you familiar with Gu Ning?” Rong Jue asked. Since Rong Zechen came to see Gu Ning, it meant that they knew each other, but knowledge and familiarity were two different things.

“No, we just met each other once. I don’t even know her. I just think Gu Ning is a very good and outstanding girl. I simply want to make friends with her,” Rong Zechen said.

“Oh,” Rong Jue replied, and said nothing further. After that, he went on to inspect.

Rong Zechen left without seeing Gu Ning.

...

At the same time, after going days without sex, Leng Shaoting couldn’t be satisfied in a short while.

At the beginning, Gu Ning was excited, but she gradually felt like it was too much and began to beg him to stop.

They didn’t stop until they were both exhausted. By this time, it was 4 pm, and they had stayed in bed for two hours. They only rested for two minutes during that time.

“Ningning, I’m sorry. I just haven’t had sex with you for too long, so I want you so much.” Looking at Gu Ning’s uncomfortable expression because of him, Leng Shaoting felt very guilty.

“I know, I don’t blame you,” Gu Ning said. Although she was uncomfortable, she didn’t mean to blame Leng Shaoting. He did it because he loved her too deeply.

They rested for half an hour, then got up.

“Let me take you to a place,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Where?” Gu Ning asked.

“You’ll know.” Leng Shaoting kept it a secret again.

“Sure!” Gu Ning didn’t bother to ask further.

When the car came to XX Street, Gu Ning guessed where Leng Shaoting was going to take her. If she didn’t guess wrong, Leng Shaoting was going to take her to the private manor Leng Yuanhan specially built for Jing Yunyao.

Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao had been to this manor, but she hadn’t talked about that with Leng Shaoting yet.

Even though Gu Ning now figured out that Leng Shaoting was going to take her to the manor, she still said nothing.

It wasn’t because she was afraid Leng Shaoting might be unhappy to know that they had come to the manor secretly. Gu Ning knew that Leng Shaoting wouldn’t be unhappy about it.

However if he knew that she had already been here, it would ruin the meaning of him bringing her here this time. After all, he didn’t tell her where they were going, because he wanted to surprise her.

Although Gu Ning had been to the manor once before and knew what the manor looked like, she was still looking forward to coming here again because she really liked this manor, which was like a paradise.

Unsurprisingly, as soon as Leng Shaoting drove Gu Ning to the outside of the manor, someone opened the gate, then Leng Shaoting drove the car inside.

Gu Ning had been here before, but she had gotten in by climbing over the wall from the side. She hadn’t been able to see the name of this manor. However, this time, they entered from the front gate, so Gu Ning saw its name, which was Xiaoyao Manor.

To be honest, this name was very common, but it was very meaningful. Leng Yuanhan built this manor because he hoped that he could put aside the worldly worries and live a happy life here with his love.

Before entering the manor, Gu Ning smelt sweet-scented osmanthus, because it was September when the sweet-scented osmanthus bloomed.
