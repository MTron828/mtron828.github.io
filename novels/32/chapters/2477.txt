Chapter 2478 Work Harder

“Shuyuan, stop behaving against them. I didn’t want to let you know, but now I feel very guilty because of your attitude towards them,” said Leng Yuanqian with a frown.

“Why do you feel guilty?” Jiang Shuyuan couldn’t understand it.

“Do you know why I suddenly told you to have a medical exam in the hospital a few days ago? It’s Yunyao who saw that you weren’t in good health. She reminded me to take you to the hospital. She knew that you would be displeased if she said it directly to you, so she told me to do that. I made up an excuse and persuaded you to go to the hospital along with me. If we didn’t find out about your disease early, you would be seriously ill right now,” said Leng Yuanqian, staring at Jiang Shuyuan. He now had no hostility towards Leng Shaoting, and even felt guilty when they met.

“What?” Knowing that, Jiang Shuyuan was shocked. To her surprise, Leng Yuanqian asked her to have a medical exam with him in the hospital due to Jing Yunyao’s reminder.

In an instant, Jiang Shuyuan had mixed emotions. It was difficult for her to digest the

news.

“Think about it!” Leng Yuanqian said, then left Jiang Shuyuan alone. After standing there still for a while, Jiang Shuyuan walked out and went back to her room. She needed more time to understand what Leng Yuanqian just told her.

In the living room, everyone enjoyed the festival in harmony.

At the beginning, Leng Shaoming felt slightly nervous due to the presence of Jing Yunyao and Leng Shaoting, but gradually, he became relaxed and wanted to join them. After all, no one had hatred towards him. It was he who kept a distance from Leng Shaoting and refused to spend time with them. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Now, he realized that it was a mistake. Leng Shaoting and the others were good people and they had never hurt him and his family. On the contrary, his family had tried to harm them many times before.

If Leng Shaoting wanted to punish Leng Shaojia for what she had done to Gu Ning, Leng Shaojia could have been sentenced to death.

Although Gu Ning was the target, Leng Shaoting and Master Leng cared about her very much. So if they had wanted to punish Leng Shaojia, Leng Shaojia would surely be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.

In the end, Gu Ning only made Leng Shaojia bedridden for half a year, which was the lightest punishment.

They were family after all. No matter which of them became the head of the Leng family in the future, all the members would receive good care.

Thinking of that, Leng Shaoming felt relieved.

“If no accident happens, Shaoming will come back to work in the capital in the later half of the year. The situation is very complicated and dangerous here. The Leng family will surely support you, but you still need to rely on yourself to build your own career. Connections aren’t everything, and your abilities matter too. Shaoting has no interest in leading the Leng family. He has his own business to manage. So your father and you will take over the Leng family in the future. You must work harder. Do you understand?” Master Leng said to Leng Shaoming.

Master Leng said that on purpose, because he knew the worries Leng Yuanqian and Leng Shaoming had. He was too protective of Leng Shaoting, so they thought that Leng Shaoting would take over the Leng family and saw Leng Shaoting as their enemy.

Actually, it was indeed Master Leng’s idea, because Leng Shaoting was able to lead the Leng family. However, Leng Shaoting was unwilling to do it. He had his job and the Shengshi Organization, so he had no more energy to lead the Leng family. In that case, Master Leng made it public to stop Leng Yuanqian and Leng Shaoming competing against Leng Shaoting. It was also Leng Shaoting’s request.

Hearing Master Leng’s words, Leng Shaoming was surprised. Although Leng Shaoting had said that he had no interest in taking over the Leng family, it wasn’t settled until Master Leng made it clear.

Now Master Leng made it very clear that Leng Shaoting wouldn’t take over the Leng family.

In the past, Leng Shaoming would have been very excited, but now he had mixed emotions.

“Grandpa, I’ll work harder.” Leng Shaoming made a serious promise, showing obvious excitement and pride. Master Leng was satisfied with his reaction.

It meant that Leng Shaoming was ready to become the future patriarch of the Leng family. “Well, I’m old now. I’m afraid I can’t be very helpful. If there are any problems, we can sit down and talk about them,” said Master Leng. He didn’t want his family to fight amongst themselves. “Sure,” said Leng Shaoming and Leng Shaoting at the same time. After chatting for a while longer, they went to bed.

In the Leng family’s house, Leng Shaoting also couldn’t sneak into Gu Ning’s room. They could only chat with each other on WeChat.

Back in his room, Leng Shaoming couldn’t sleep at all. When he saw Leng Yuanqian’s study was still bright, he went to see his father and told his father what Master Leng just said to them.

Leng Yuanqian wasn’t as excited as Leng Shaoming expected, because he already let go of his dissatisfaction with Leng Shaoting. Actually, he already accepted it if Leng Shaoting was going to take over the Leng family. After all, Leng Shaoting was very excellent, and the Leng family needed a strong leader to keep its position.

Anyway, since Master Leng made it clear that Leng Shaoming would be the new leader of their family, he was still happy to hear it.

“Great, you should do your best and don’t disappoint your grandfather. Do you understand?” said Leng Yuanqian.

“Sure,” said Leng Shaoming.

The next day, many officials who belonged to the same faction as the Leng family came to visit them in the morning.

They didn’t stay for long and after giving the gifts and chatting for a short while, they left. They didn’t stay for a meal, because they didn’t want to bother the Leng family.

After having lunch in the Leng family’s house, Gu Ning and the others left for the siheyuan since Gu Ning needed to visit Shangguan Yang.

When she went to dine in the siheyuan, she also called Gao Yi and Qiao Ya over. It was the New Year festival, so they should have a large gathering

In the afternoon, collateral branches of the Leng family came, and because they were relatives, they would stay for a meal.
