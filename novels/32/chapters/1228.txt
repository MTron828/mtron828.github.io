Chapter 1230 Zhang Yanni Is More Jealous of Zhao Fulin

It wasn’t difficult for both of them to do that, because neither of them lacked money.Gu Ning had no intention to make Jiang Yutong buy Kouzi for her, but she aimed to embarrass her.

“Why not! I don’t believe Kouzi will have the make-up line within a month,” Jiang Yutong said.

Tang Jiakai felt like laughing, but controlled himself. Jiang Yutong was doomed to fail.

“Gu Ning...” Jiang Jiamin, however, was a little worried. Although she knew Gu Ning was very rich, she thought that there was no need for Gu Ning to have such a bet with Jiang Yutong.

“It’s fine, it’s not a big deal for me,” Gu Ning said airily. She still didn’t want to tell them that she was the founder of Kouzi.

After a while, Jiang Jiamin’s mother called them to go to the hall.

The party began at 6 pm, and it ended at 7:30 pm. The members of the Tang family left earliest, because other people didn’t dare to leave if they were still here.

When Gu Ning was about to walk out, Zhao Fulin seemed to have something to talk to Gu Ning about.

Seeing that, Gu Ning directly asked her, “Do you have anything you want to talk to me about?”

“Um, can we be friends on WeChat?” Zhao Fulin asked.

“Sure.” Gu Ning smiled.

Zhao Fulin beamed at once, and they added each other on WeChat.

“I’m in! You can’t leave me behind.” Jiang Jiamin approached them and added Gu Ning on WeChat.

Although they had only gotten along with one another for a short time, Gu Ning had a good impression of them and she was willing to be kind to them.

It wasn’t a bad thing to have more friends.

“A bunch of bored people,” Jiang Yutong, who stood not far from them, said with disdain.

Gu Ning heard it, but she didn’t care about it.

“Oh, Fulin, why don’t we take some photos with Gu Ning?” Jiang Jiamin suddenly said to Zhao Fulin with a mysterious smile.

Zhao Fulin didn’t understand it, but wouldn’t refuse to do it either, because she liked Gu Ning.

“Can we?” she asked Gu Ning.

“No problem.” Gu Ning smiled. She definitely understood why Jiang Jiamin said that, and she was amused.

Afterwards, they took some photos together.

When Gu Ning was gone, Jiang Jiamin asked Zhao Fulin, “Have you heard of Gu Ning’s achievements?”

“What achievements?” Zhao Fulin was confused.

“Ha-ha, I knew that you didn’t know. Search her name on the Internet, and I promise you’ll be surprised,” Jiang Jiamin said.

Zhao Fulin listened to her and searched Gu Ning’s name on the Internet, then she was shocked by the news about Gu Ning. To her astonishment, Gu Ning had done so many unbelievable things before.

In addition, Gu Ning was also the famous Goddess Gu!

Zhao Fulin became Gu Ning’s fan now.

“You told me to take photos with her because of this, right?” Zhao Fulin asked with excitement.

“Yeah.” Jiang Jiamin nodded.

“Why didn’t you tell me earlier?” Zhao Fulin complained.

“How could I tell you that in front of Gu Ning? She wants to keep a low-profile, and you can find out her achievements yourself through the Internet anyway,” Jiang Jiamin said.

“You’re right.” Zhao Fulin agreed.

They were close friends, so they knew each other’s character very well.

Without hesitation, Zhao Fulin posted those photos to her WeChat moments.

Zhao Fulin: Honored to see famous Goddess Gu tonight! Thanks to my dear friend. What a happy ending of this beautiful day!

Her dear friend was obviously Jiang Jiamin.

Once Zhao Fulin posted those photos, some of her friends who were also Gu Ning’s fans got excited. They all hoped that they could see Gu Ning one day in real life.

Some were also curious about who Goddess Gu was, so Zhao Fulin told them to do the research themselves.

Within a short time, more people became Gu Ning’s fans.

Zhang Yanni was also in Zhao Fulin’s friend circle, because Zhao Fulin hadn’t deleted her yet.

When she saw the photos, she searched Gu Ning’s name on the Internet without delay.

After reading many pieces of news about Gu Ning, she was amazed too. At the same time, Zhang Yanni was more jealous of Zhao Fulin now. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Zhao Fulin was prettier than her, and Zhao Fulin’s family was also richer than her family. Even the boy she liked admired Zhao Fulin at first.

Then when Zhao Fulin was in danger, Gu Ning showed up and saved her life.
