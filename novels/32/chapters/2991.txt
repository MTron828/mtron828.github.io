2994 Break the Record

Honestly, no one thought that Leng Xiaoyao could defeat Ling Tianqi, so they were all surprised when Leng Xiaoyao directly left Ling Tianqi behind and even kept a distance ahead of him.

“Wow, boss is so awesome!” Xiong Manxin exclaimed excitedly. She admired Leng Xiaoyao more than ever now.

“Jesus, Leng Xiaoyao directly overtook Tianqi from the very start! I thought Tianqi could overtake Xiaoyao,” Pei Heran said in surprise. It was really beyond his expectations.

“It seems we thought lightly of her,” Feng Rui said.

!!

Although it was just the beginning and the race wasn’t over yet, normally the racer at the front would win in the end.

After all, it was a car race, and even a second could make a big difference.

“How is that possible?” The man who bet with Li Mochen couldn’t believe it either.

Even Li Mochen was slightly surprised.

In the beginning, they thought it must be due to luck that Leng Xiaoyao could overtake Ling Tianqi, so they focused on the game and waited for Ling Tianqi to overtake Leng Xiaoyao.

Even Ling Tianqi had the same opinion.

Unfortunately, no matter how fast Ling Tianqi drove, he still couldn’t overtake Leng Xiaoyao and the distance between them only grew.

As for their skills, Ling Tianqi was obviously worse than Leng Xiaoyao.

At the turn, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t slow down, but drove steadily the entire time. It didn’t seem dangerous to her.

Ling Tianqi, on the other hand, had to slow down or he would hit the safety rails.

Watching that, everyone was surprised by Leng Xiaoyao’s skills.

“Jesus, Leng Xiaoyao is so good. She’s like a professional racer!” Feng Rui exclaimed.

“Perhaps she’s even better than professional racers. She didn’t even slow down at the turn. And she drives so steadily. She’s so good! I feel embarrassed for doubting her abilities,” Pei Heran admitted.

“Ha-ha, I knew my boss could do it. I’m in love now.” Xiong Manxin admired Leng Xiaoyao more than ever and even fell in love with her.

…

In the lounge.

“I didn’t expect this girl to be so skilled at car racing. I was really wrong,” the man said. He was extremely impressed by Leng Xiaoyao who completely changed his impression of women. “Chen, did you agree to bet with me because you noticed her abilities?”

He didn’t really believe that, because he only bet for fun and didn’t care about the result.

“No, I didn’t,” Li Mochen said.

“Do you think she’s better than you?” the man asked. He couldn’t tell whether Leng Xiaoyao or Li Mochen would be better at racing.

“Hard to say. I don’t think there is a huge gap,” Li Mochen said. He agreed that Leng Xiaoyao was very skilled. Because there wasn’t a huge gap, he couldn’t say that he would win. But if they competed, he thought that there was a 50% probability that he would win.

“Well, well, that’s a high compliment. I think I need to make friends with that girl. I must let her compete against you even once,” the man said. He was really interested in Leng Xiaoyao.

Hearing that, Li Mochen didn’t stop him.

….

At the starting line.

Many people had gathered there. Watching the game on the monitor, they were all astonished, but they could only see the cars, and couldn’t see the people inside, so they didn’t know that the winner was a young girl.

If they knew, they would be even more surprised.

Because the speed of the racing car was generally about 350 kilometers to 400 kilometers per hour, and the track was 30 kilometers long, it usually took about five to six minutes

However, Leng Xiaoyao finished the run in only 4 minutes and 28 seconds, while Ling Tianqi took almost 5 minutes and 42 seconds.

This gap was very large, and it wasn’t even Leng Xiaoyao’s best performance. If Leng Xiaoyao did her best, it would take less than 4 minutes.

When Leng Xiaoyao got out of the car, everyone was shocked to see a young girl.

“Jesus, it’s a young girl.”

“Oh my, I can’t believe it. It’s a girl.”

“I thought it was a famous racer.”

“She’s amazing.”

“…”

Xiong Manxin directly ran to Leng Xiaoyao and gave her a big hug. “Boss, you’re amazing. I heard that you broke the record!”

Pei Heran and Feng Rui walked towards Leng Xiaoyao as well.

“Xiaoyao, you’re really impressive. I should apologize for doubting your abilities. It’s my fault,” Pei Heran said with a sincere attitude.

“Don’t say that. I didn’t take it to heart,” Leng Xiaoyao replied.

Hearing that, Pei Heran felt much better. After all, he didn’t want to offend such a skilled person.

A while later, Ling Tianqi arrived. After getting out of the car, he walked towards them. He was upset, but he accepted the result.

“Xiaoyao, I shouldn’t have disdained you. You’re much better than me. You’re as good as a professional racer,” Ling Tianqi said.

“I’m flattered,” Leng Xiaoyao said politely. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Fine, you win. What do you want me to do?” asked Ling Tianqi. He kept his word.

“Nothing serious. Just let me know if there are any car races. I want to watch it. If you’re going to compete with anyone, call me out and I want to try too,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She couldn’t tell him what she foresaw, so she decided to take action according to the situation at that time.

“No problem.” Ling Tianqi agreed with alacrity, because it was very easy. He didn’t think further about that, and thought that Leng Xiaoyao simply had a lot of interest in car racing.

If not, she couldn’t be so good at it. After all, it took years for someone to become so good.

At that moment, the man who came with Li Mochen walked over, but Li Mochen wasn’t with him.

When Leng Xiaoyao saw Li Mochen, she didn’t see the man, so she had no idea that he came with Li Mochen.

...

“Hi, Mr. Si.”

Once Ling Tianqi and the others saw the man, they politely greeted him, but the man didn’t know them.

Nevertheless, the man gave them a nod of acknowledgement.
