3021 An All-round Genius

The result was that the number which called the truck driver in front of Leng Yecheng was the same one that called Zhang Jinhua.

Obviously, they were a group.

Afterwards, Leng Xiaoyao needed to investigate this phone number.

After her investigation, she found the person was a middleman, but he had contacted Zhang Guanglin the day before yesterday.

!!

After a series of investigations, Leng Xiaoyao finally figured out that it was Zhang Guanglin who turned to this middleman for help. And the middleman paid the truck driver to harm Leng Yecheng.

In other words, the key person in this car crash was Zhang Guanglin, but Leng Xiaoyao didn’t think he was the mastermind. There must be someone else behind his back. Who was it? Leng Xiaoyao guessed the person must be in the company Zhang Guanglin wanted to work for.

Without delay, Leng Xiaoyao investigated Zhang Guanglin’s call records.

She then saw call records between Zhang Guanglin and a manager in another company.

There were many people who had called Zhang Guanglin, so it wasn’t enough to prove that he was guilty, but Leng Xiaoyao was extremely suspicious of them.

She just needed to make sure of it by conducting a further investigation. After all, she only had clues now.

After Leng Xiaoyao figured it out, it was already 3 am, but she didn’t feel sleepy or tired. She was still full of energy.

Anyway, she could stop investigating for the time being. All they needed to do next was to interrogate Zhang Guanglin.

Leng Xiaoyao decided to do that on her own.

After that, she took out the files and started reading.

Leng Xiaoyao had learned about business from Gu Ning and was talented. She had dealt with complicated cases before, so she easily and quickly remembered the designing project for Fenglin Yuan.

She spent two hours getting familiar with it, then slept for an hour before waking up at 6 am.

At this time, Leng Yecheng was awake too. He immediately rang the bell because he needed to use the bathroom.

Leng Xiaoyao was in the room, but she was a girl and his niece. It wasn’t convenient for her to help him.

After a male nurse came, he helped Leng Yecheng use the bathroom and left. Then Leng Xiaoyao went inside to see Leng Yecheng and told him what she had found out.

“Uncle, I found out something, but I still need more time to get the final result.” When Leng Xiaoyao told Leng Yecheng what she had found out, Leng Yecheng was stunned.

He wasn’t surprised that Zhang Guanglin might be guilty, because he was suspicious of him once he realized the car crash was a scheme, but he was shocked by Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities. Within such a short time, she had found out a lot of clues.

Now he admired Leng Xiaoyao more than ever.

“What do you plan to do next?” Leng Yecheng asked.

“We should interrogate Zhang Guanglin. I’ll do that,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Great.” Leng Yecheng answered. After witnessing Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities, Leng Yecheng completely trusted her. As long as she was willing to help, he believed there was nothing she couldn’t do.

“Oh, I’ve read all the files. There is still some time. I can present it to you. What do you think? You can be the client and ask me difficult questions to see whether you can be persuaded by me,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Hearing that, Leng Yecheng was surprised again. Leng Xiaoyao read all the files too?

“Did you not sleep at all last night?” Leng Yecheng asked, but Leng Xiaoyao looked energetic. It didn’t seem as if she had stayed up all night. Instead, it seemed as if she had a very good sleep.

“I slept at 5 am and got up at 6 am. After all, I’ve practiced kung fu for a long time, so it won’t affect my condition even if I’m up all night,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She was very honest with Leng Yecheng.

Hearing that Leng Xiaoyao was up for a whole night, Leng Yecheng felt a little guilty. “Even though you can still be energetic, don’t stay up all night again. It’ll harm your health.”

“Alright, I know.” In order to set Leng Yecheng’s mind at ease, Leng Xiaoyao agreed. She wouldn’t be so honest with Leng Yecheng next time if she stayed up all night again.

Afterwards, Leng Xiaoyao took Leng Yecheng as the client and introduced the project of Fenglin Yuan.

When she did the introduction, she edited it and made it better. Leng Yecheng noticed the change, and his eyes lit up after hearing Leng Xiaoyao’s introduction.

“Yaoyao, you’re a genius, an all-round genius!” As soon as Leng Xiaoyao finished, Leng Yecheng complimented her.

Luckily, Leng Xiaoyao was his niece, or he wouldn’t hesitate to poach her if she worked for another company.

In fact, talented people wouldn’t stay in small companies, they always chose to work for big companies.

“I agree with you!” Leng Xiaoyao said with pride, but Leng Yecheng didn’t think that she was thinking too highly of herself. After all, she was really very outstanding. If she was too modest, she might appear hypocritical.

However, Leng Yecheng still joked. “Aren’t you modest?”

“It’s a fact. I don’t think I need to be modest. After all, I’ll look hypocritical if I’m too modest,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

When it was necessary, she would be modest, but it was unnecessary in front of her family.

“You’re right!” Leng Yecheng was amazed.

Leng Xiaoyao’s character didn’t change much. She was as proud of herself as always, but her pride matched her abilities now.

“What questions do you have?” Leng Xiaoyao asked. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

After Leng Yecheng asked her several difficult questions, which Leng Xiaoyao answered easily, Leng Yecheng was very satisfied.

“Ningning, you’re really amazing. I believe you can take over the company in the future,” Leng Yecheng said. Although he had been managing the company during these years, he had no intention of keeping it.

If Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t a good manager, he would support her, but if she could manage the company well, he was more than willing to leave it to her.

As for his kids in the future, he had shares of the company, which was enough to provide them with a good life.
