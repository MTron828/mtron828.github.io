When Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin had just sat down, someone immediately poured cups of tea for them.

Gu Ning glanced around the store. It wasn’t big, and was only around 20 square-meters, but there were many choices of clothes, like formal gowns and regular dresses. Gu Ning found the designs of the formal dresses were truly as special and beautiful as Cao Wenxin had told her.

Yu Zi herself designed and made every piece of clothing here. This store was small, so it was impossible for her to have a factory. And most of the gowns were customized. All the clothes in the store right now were basically samples. Of course, if customers wanted to buy the samples in the store, they could also directly buy it. However, the majority preferred to wear customized gowns because they fit better.

“I like your gowns. You can keep chatting, and I’ll have a look around,” Gu Ning said to them, then stood up to look at the formal dresses.

After a round, Gu Ning pointed at a gown and asked, “What size is this? Would it fit me?”

Yu Zi was struck dumb for a second. She didn’t expect that Gu Ning would directly buy the dress in the store. “It’s a small. Do you want to try it?” Saying that, she walked to Gu Ning.

“No need. I’ll buy this one.” Gu Ning didn’t try it, nor ask its price, but bought it without hesitation.

Hearing that, Yu Zi was surprised, not because Gu Ning wanted to buy it, but because she didn’t even bother to ask its price. It was the first time that she had met such a generous customer. However, if Gu Ning didn’t try it, wasn’t she worried that it wouldn’t fit.

It was winter, and they were all in thick coats, so it was hard to see Gu Ning’s figure. Yu Zi had no idea whether this gown would fit Gu Ning.

If it was normal dresses, it would be fine even if it was a little loose or tight, but the gown that Gu Ning pointed at was very tight.

“Ningning, you don’t want to try it?” Cao Wenxin was also surprised. Women always enjoyed trying new clothes, but Gu Ning wouldn’t waste time on that.

“I don’t think it’s necessary, because I know my size,” Gu Ning said.

Since Gu Ning said so, Yu Zi didn’t insist. “No problem, I’ll pack it up for you now.”

Yu Zi wasn’t dumb, and she realized now that Cao Wenxin and Gu Ning intentionally came here to support her. Yu Zi packed the gown for Gu Ning.

“This gown is sixty-eight thousand yuan. Since you’re Wenxin’s friend, I can give you 20% off, and it’ll be 54.4 thousand yuan,” Yu Zi said.

“Sure.” Gu Ning took out a bank card and gave it to Yu Zi.

Yu Zi was a little surprised again. Gu Ning had to be very rich to buy a gown which cost dozens of thousands of yuan without caring about its price.

In fact, Yu Zi didn’t know Cao Wenxin’s family background, not because Cao Wenxin wasn’t willing to tell her, but because they were merely normal friends, and it wasn’t necessary to talk about family background. Cao Wenxin was also generous shopper, so Yu Zi knew that she had to be rich, but she had no idea how rich she was.

“Ningning, please sit here for a little while longer. I need to use the ladies’ room,” Cao Wenxin said to Gu Ning. She suddenly felt uncomfortable in her stomach.

“Sure. I’ll wait for you,” Gu Ning replied.

After paying the bill, Yu Zi and Gu Ning were chatting in the lounge again.

“Miss Yu, I heard from Wenxin that you design and make all the gowns on your own?” Gu Ning asked.

“Yes! My major in college was clothing design, and I’m extremely interested in gowns,” Yu Zi said.

“I think they’re all pretty. Your gowns must be popular!” Gu Ning deliberately asked for a reason.

Yu Zi seemed a little upset, but still smiled. “Not very popular actually. I can only sell four to five gowns in a month. Deducting the costs, my income is only enough for paying the rent, salaries, and my daily expenses.”

Gu Ning was Cao Wenxin’s friend, so Yu Zi was willing to tell her the truth.

“If it continues like that, will you keep running the store? I like your designs, and I will definitely come back again,” Gu Ning said.

“Well, it’s my honor to have your approval. Although I do feel stressed, it’s my choice and I’ll keep running this store as long as it’s profitable till I succeed one day. However, life isn’t only about a dream, so I will probably have to change my job if my store can barely stay afloat,” Yu Zi said. She wasn’t stubborn.

After a second, Yu Zi added, “No matter whether this store is open or not, you can contact me whenever you want a gown and I can design and make it for you.” Even if she wasn’t able to run her own store, she could do it as a part-time job. She would be dumb if she missed the opportunity to make some money.

“I have an idea which can help you build this brand up. I’m not sure whether it can develop it into a top brand, but it definitely can become a well-known brand. I have confidence. How about you?” Gu Ning asked.

“Really?” Yu Zi was quite surprised, and her eyes lit up. “How?”

Although Yu Zi had some doubts because of Gu Ning’s age, she wouldn’t jump to conclusions. No matter what, it wasn’t a bad thing to hear Gu Ning’s idea. Yu Zi knew that it cost a lot to advertise and promote a brand, and she lacked enough money.

“In my opinion, your designs are good, and I also have the intention to be involved in the clothing industry. Therefore, I can invest in your brand if you agree for me to do so, and I’ll handle the advertising and promotion of your brand. Meanwhile, you can focus on the design and management of Charm while you’re still the builder of the brand. All you need to do is to create designs, and I’ll give you 20% shares. what do you think?” Gu Ning said seriously.

Gu Ning was aiming to hire Yu Zi. Although it sounded strange to talk about such serious business at the first meeting, Gu Ning was an efficient woman, and she wouldn’t waste more time on the deal if she could strike it right now.
