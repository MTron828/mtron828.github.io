Chapter 468 Cold-blooded?

“Chen Llangwei said that he’s going to throw Xiaoxiao in jail,” Gu Qinxiang said in despair.

“What?” Lin Lijuan was shocked and almost fell onto the ground. Luckily, Gu Qingyun who stood behind her supported her on time.

“Dad, I don’t want to be put in jail! Please help me out!” Gu Xiaoxiao cried in fear when she heard that she could end up in jail.

“You don’t want to be put in jail? Why didn’t you think about the consequences before you pushed Ziyao into the road?” Gu Qinxiang snapped at her. He was so mad and disappointed that he almost beat Gu Xiaoxiao.

“What should we do now? We can’t let Xiaoxiao be put in jail!” Lin Lijuan asked.

“What can I do? Chen Llangwei refused to settle it out of court, and it wasn’t an accident after all.” Gu Qinxiang lost his patience. He also had no idea how to handle it right now.

“Oh, call Gu Man! Doesn’t she know Mrs. Hao? It’s very easy for the Hao family to protect Xiaoxiao!” Lin Lijuan thought of Gu Man all of a sudden and told Gu Qinxiang to call her.

Although Gu Qinxiang didn’t think that Gu Man would be willing to help him, he still called her because there was nothing else he could do.

Gu Man thought that Gu Qinxiang was calling to borrow money, but she still answered his call in case he had something else to talk to her about.

After Gu Man heard what Gu Xiaoxiao had done, she was astonished too. However, she rejected Gu Qinxiang’s request without hesitation.

“Gu Man, do you have to be so cold-blooded?” Gu Qinxiang was in a rage. “You already refused to lend me money, but how can you stand aside when Xiaoxiao is in trouble!”

It seemed that it was all Gu Man’s fault in his eyes. Gu Man was also furious, and yelled angrily, “Gu Qinxiang! Do you know how shameless and selfish your family is? Gu Xiaoxiao committed a crime and she should take responsibility for it! When she turned to her cousin trying to hurt Ningning last time, she should have been put in jail already! We didn’t sue her, just because she’s a relative. It’s insane to think that the Hao family will help a criminal!”

After that, Gu Man directly hung up on Gu Qinxiang. Gu Qinxiang was so annoyed that he almost smashed his phone.

“How is it? Did she agree?” Although Lin Lijuan already had the answer from Gu Qinxiang’s reaction, she still couldn’t accept it. From her perspective, Gu Man had to help them.

After hanging up on Gu Qinxiang, Gu Man went to tell Gu Qing and her family who lived next door what Gu Xiaoxiao had done.

Gu Qing and Jiang Xu were also stunned, but neither of them had sympathy for Gu Xiaoxiao. They didn’t know the specific reason for the conflict which caused Gu Xiaoxiao to push the girl into the middle of a road, but Gu Xiaoxiao had already committed the crime of intentional assault. As long as Chen Ziyao’s parents weren’t willing to forgive her, she would be put in jail.

They definitely had no sympathy for a criminal, especially after what Gu Xiaoxiao had done to Gu Ning before. Therefore, when Gu Qinxiang called Gu Qing and Jiang Xu later, neither of them answered his call, which irritated Gu Qinxiang, but he could do nothing about it. Nevertheless, he didn’t want to give up, and called Gu Qinyang later. He tried to get Gu Qinyang to help him persuade Gu Man. Gu Qinyang was also greatly surprised after hearing the shocking news. He hesitated for a while before he rejected Gu Qinxiang, because Gu Xiaoxiao had already committed the crime, and he hated those who wanted to get away with a crime more since he was a public servant himself.

Ever since he had found out what Gu Xiaoxiao had done to Gu Ning the last time, he had the worse impression of Gu Xiaoxiao. Gu Qinxiang spoiled his children rotten and that was why they were so law-defying. At the same time, Gu Qinyang also realized that he had to teach his own children well and never allow them to behave like Gu Xiaoxiao.

Gu Qinxiang swore at Gu Qinyang but couldn’t do anything about it either. In the end, he had to go to the hospital and apologize to Chen Ziyao’s parents in person.

Unfortunately, Chen Ziyao’s parents still refused to settle it out of court, and Gu Qinxiang could only hire the best lawyer he could afford to see whether the lawyer could change something

Although Gu Qinyang rejected Gu Qinxiang, he called Gu Qing later and told her about it.

Gu Qing said to him seriously, “Maybe you think that we’re cold-blooded, but we did it for a good reason. We didn’t sue Gu Xiaoxiao last time after what she did to Ningning but she won’t reflect on herself. If she doesn’t need to bear the consequences of her own terrible behavior, she won’t learn from it. Luckily, you called me, instead of Man. Man would feel hurt if you call her and brought it up again. You know Ningning is very successful now. If you really treat us as your family, we’ll help you if you have any problems in the future.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“I understand,” Gu Qinyang said. He definitely knew that Gu Ning had the ability to get rid of him, so he didn’t dare to annoy her. He also felt lucky that he hadn’t intentionally hurt Gu Man and Gu Ning, even though he had also despised them before. In addition, Gu Ning was willing to forgive them. Gu Qinyang and his wife were just common public servants without any power or much money after all.

Chen Ziyao was injured on her face, and her legs were broken too. She could have plastic surgery to repair her face, but she wouldn’t be able to stand anymore. That being the case, her parents were determined to throw Gu Xiaoxiao in jail.

Gu Ning and her friends didn’t follow the news, and they didn’t leave the bar until it was nearly 12 pm.

“Mu Ke, would you please send Mixi home?” Gu Ning asked. She wouldn’t interfere in their personal affairs, but she was willing to create a chance for them so that they could be alone for a while. And it was totally up to them whether they could move a step forward.

“No problem.” Mu Ke of course wouldn’t reject, but he was very nervous, because he knew that Gu Ning must have found out about his fondness towards Yu Mixi. Yu Mixi, on the other hand, had no idea about it, so she agreed to let Mu Ke send her home, and they got in a taxi.

Seeing Mu Ke and Yu Mixi leaving in the taxi, Hao Ran wore a smile and said, “Boss, are you creating chances for them?” Although it was a question, he already knew the answer was affirmative.

“I don’t think Yu Mixi knows about Mu Ke’s feelings towards her. I do hope that they can be together,” Chu Peihan said. They were so young right now, and it was too far away for them to get married or have a family, so none of them knew what would happen in the future. If Mu Ke and Yu Mixi’s relationship failed one of them could leave their team, because it was rare to see a couple be friends again after breaking up with each other.
