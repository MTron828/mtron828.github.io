3387 Are You Crazy?

After filling their stomachs, they rested for a while, then went home.

That day, Li Mochen occasionally sent Leng Xiaoyao text messages, asking what she was doing and saying that he missed her.

Leng Xiaoyao felt resigned and also felt warm in her heart.

After being at home for a while, Leng Xiaoyao made up an excuse to go out shopping and secretly asked Li Mochen to go along. Li Mochen was very happy.

Leng Xiaoyao drove the new car she bought today and asked Li Mochen to walk a distance and get into the car later, so as not to be discovered by Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng.

Li Mochen complained. “I feel like I’m a secret lover. Is it an underground affair?”

“Now you are,” Leng Xiaoyao said bluntly.

Li Mochen felt a little tired of this.

“Where are we going?” Li Mochen asked. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Since the excuse for going out is shopping, let’s go to the shopping mall! We can buy two sets of clothes for my grandfather and uncle,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t want her lie to be exposed!

Li Mochen didn’t mind as long as he could be with Leng Xiaoyao. He was willing to go anywhere.

Leng Xiaoyao told Li Mochen that she had run into Tao Yixiao today. Li Mochen was very displeased about it. He immediately called Tao Zheng to warn him

To avoid Tao Yixiao causing trouble again, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t stop Li Mochen.

“Tao Zheng, tell your sister to behave herself. If she dares to insult Xiaoyao again, I’ll have to teach her a lesson. She really has no manners at all,” Li Mochen said coldly. Although this had nothing to do with Tao Zheng, he was in a bad mood.

After learning that Tao Yixiao had humiliated Leng Xiaoyao, Tao Zheng was shocked and immediately assured Li Mochen that there would be no next time.

After hanging up the phone with Li Mochen, Tao Zheng immediately went downstairs to find Tao Yixiao and coldly asked, “Did you humiliate Leng Xiaoyao today?”

Tao Yixiao didn’t know who Leng Xiaoyao was, but when she heard Tao Zheng’s question, she knew that the girl she met today was Leng Xiaoyao. She felt guilty but didn’t admit it directly. “Who told you that? That’s ridiculous.”

“Ridiculous? Mochen personally called me to warn me. Tao Yixiao, are you crazy? Mochen doesn’t like you, so you humiliate his girlfriend? Do you want to ruin the Tao family?” Seeing that Tao Yixiao didn’t admit it, Tao Zheng was angry.

“Why will the Tao family be affected? Brother, can’t you stop making a fuss?” Tao Yixiao thought that Tao Zheng was making a fuss. She just said a few words. How could it ruin the Tao family?

“What? Do you think offending her doesn’t come at a cost? This time Li Mochen just gave me a warning for my sake. Next time, he won’t be so lenient on you.” Tao Zheng’s expression was cold, which made Tao Yixiao feel a chill.

The argument between the siblings attracted their parents.

“What’s going on here?” Mr. Tao asked sternly.

Tao Zheng explained the situation at once. Mr. Tao also looked angry when he saw Tao Yixiao’s expression. “If you dare to offend Li Mochen again, get out of the Tao family!”

Although this was just an angry remark, Mr. Tao really didn’t want Tao Yixiao to do anything stupid.

Li Mochen had helped the Tao family a lot, but even if he hadn’t, he was not someone the Tao family could afford to provoke. However, his daughter had gone and offended him.

Tao Yixiao wasn’t afraid of Tao Zheng’s words, but Tao Yixiao was scared by their father’s words and realized the seriousness of the situation.

Although she was still unwilling to accept the result, she listened and promised their father that she would not pick on Leng Xiaoyao anymore.

In fact, she knew that picking on Leng Xiaoyao didn’t benefit her at all, it only made her lose face.

…

Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen went to the shopping mall and bought two sets of clothes and a pair of shoes for Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng, as well as a set of clothes and a pair of shoes for Li Mochen.

Li Mochen didn’t even refuse. He just happily put them on.

It was a good thing that his girlfriend bought clothes for him. There was no reason for him to refuse!

Afterwards, Li Mochen took Leng Xiaoyao to a women’s clothing store and bought her a set of clothes.

Leng Xiaoyao refused because she had just bought a lot of clothes, but Li Mochen didn’t listen. He threatened to buy it directly if Leng Xiaoyao didn’t try it on, so she gave in.

Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t only beautiful, she also had a good figure. She looked good in anything she wore. She tried on the first set and Li Mochen bought it without hesitation.

Leng Xiaoyao originally wanted to change back into her own clothes, but Li Mochen didn’t let her. He insisted that she should wear the new clothing, so she did.

After shopping, the two went for a walk in the park. This time, Li Mochen directly held Leng Xiaoyao’s hand. She struggled a few times, but couldn’t get away, so she stopped struggling. Although she hadn’t admitted it verbally that they were boyfriend and girlfriend, their way of getting along was exactly like a couple.

Because Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng were at home, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t stay out for long and returned before 10 pm.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t let Li Mochen get off at the door. Instead, she made him get off when they were still a distance away. Li Mochen was upset.

Fortunately, they had a secret kiss when he got out of the car, which was considered compensation.

When Leng Xiaoyao returned home, Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng were playing chess in the living room. Because she was afraid of them being bored, Leng Xiaoyao had prepared board games and many books.

When they saw Leng Xiaoyao’s return, they immediately put down their chess pieces to greet her.

“Why did you buy so many things!” Leng Changyuan asked.

“I bought clothes and shoes for you. Try it on!” Leng Xiaoyao smiled.

“Wow! You even bought us clothes!” Leng Changyuan couldn’t wait to see them. Although Leng Yecheng also bought him clothes, what his granddaughter bought made him even happier.

Knowing that Leng Xiaoyao was rich, Leng Changyuan didn’t say that it was a waste of money.

“There’s mine too! It seems that my niece hasn’t forgotten about me.” Leng Yecheng was also very happy.

The two of them tried on the clothes, pants, and shoes with great enthusiasm. The sizes were suitable, and Leng Xiaoyao had good taste. The styles and colors were all suitable for them. They complimented her happily.

The next day, Leng Yecheng drove them to visit Tianmen, the Imperial Palace and the museum.

They left the Imperial Palace at 3 pm and went to Leng Xiaoyao’s company.

When Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng saw Leng Xiaoyao’s company, they were both shocked.

“Yaoyao, is this really your company?” Leng Changyuan asked. He couldn’t believe it.

“Yeah!” Leng Xiaoyao answered.

“Yaoyao, your company is so much better than Fengshang Design,” Leng Yecheng said with envy.

“When the real estate project in City Chang is completed, you’ll also earn a lot of money. If the design company gets better, you can also move to a bigger office,” Leng Xiaoyao said with a smile.
