Chapter 669 Danger Stays with Power and Wealth

Some liked famous brands, which could accentuate their wealth. While some preferred brands of good quality, which were comfortable. Different people had different opinions.

“Is there any piece that you like? I can buy it for you as a gift,” Si Ming said to Qiu Yuxin.

“Aren’t you afraid that it’ll cost you a fortune?” Qiu Yuxin smiled.

“I’m happy to buy it for you as long as you’re happy,” Si Ming said.

“Please, stop showing off your affection for each other.” Cao Wenxin felt so hurt standing by their side.

“We don’t mind it if you can do the same,” Qiu Yuxin said, and challenged Cao Wenxin.

Cao Wenxin pouted in silence.

Many onlookers posted videos and photos of the opening ceremony of Jade Beauty Jewelry on the Internet, and it soon became a hot topic.

Everyone was shocked by the attendees.

“Jesus, Goddess Gu is able to maintain a good relationship with so many famous corporations and even the two biggest

gangs!”

“Goddess Gu is so unbelievable!”

“Qinghua Group and Heiqi Group don’t stand for the Qing Gang and the Kirin Gang! Stop bragging!”

“Exactly, Qinghua Group and Heiqi Group are just businesses of the Qing Gang and the Kirin Gang.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Many people held that opinion, which Gu Ning wouldn’t disagree with.

“So what? It’s still not an easy thing to maintain a good relationship with Qinghua Group and Heiqi Group.”

“I’m short of words to describe my astonishment now.”

“Goddess Gu, are you still hiring? Can I join your company?”

“Me too!”

Although many people complimented Gu Ning’s achievement, there were still many haters too.

“It must be a publicity stunt!”

“I don’t believe that she can have such a powerful network at such an early age.”

“Me either.”

...

In some people’s eyes, it was hard to believe that Gu Ning, who was still a young girl, could maintain a good relationship with many famous companies and important figures.

Some haters even attacked Gu Ning on the Internet.

“Did she sell her body to build up her network? She’s very attractive after all.”

“I agree, so it must be a publicity stunt.”

“Nonsense! You are just being jealous.”

“Do you have any evidence to prove that she has done that?”

“Stop slandering Goddess Gu!”

“Do you have any evidence to prove that she has not done that?”

“Don’t be so mean. Goddess Gu earns everything on her own.”

“You’re just her dumb fan!”

“You’re a stupid hater!”

Many haters were still attacking Gu Ning on the Internet, but Gu Ning’s loyal fans defended her even harder.

“Did you lose your reason? Who would dare to use those dominant business groups for a publicity stunt? Although Goddess Gu is really outstanding, she doesn’t have the ability to fool those important figures in business.”

“Exactly! Qinghua Group also attended the opening ceremony of Jade Beauty Jewelry in City G last time.”

“Open your eyes! Couldn’t you see that both

aster Tang, who’s the richest man in City B, and Master Lei, who’s the leading role of another super-rich family in City B, attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony?”

“Those haters are all idiots!”

Afterwards, reporters who had attended the opening ceremony posted their interviews on their official Weibo accounts, which proved that everything was real.

Within minutes, Jade Beauty Jewelry and Gu Ning became the hottest topics on Weibo once more.

Many celebrities were jealous of Gu Ning now, because they had tried hard to be a hot topic on Weibo but it was in vain. However, they were also astonished by Gu Ning’s network.

Shengshi Group, Jinlin Group and Tanghuang Group were all the top business corporations in this country. In addition, the businesses of the two biggest gangs also had a relationship with Gu Ning. In that case, nobody dared to cause Gu Ning or Jade Beauty Jewelry any trouble.

Ordinary people, of course, didn’t dare to do that, but ambitious people were exceptions.

Danger always stayed with power and wealth.

No matter who you were or what industry you were involved in, you would have competitors or even enemies the moment you joined the society. Therefore, although most people were afraid of Gu Ning’s network, some still dared to challenge her.

Tang Weiyong was one of them. He was going to fight against the Tang family in business, and Gu Ning was his target too.
