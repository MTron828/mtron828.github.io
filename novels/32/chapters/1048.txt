Chapter 1050 Gu Ning“s Business Empire

Right at this moment, Gu Ning’s phone rang before she could say something. She set a special ringtone for Leng Shaoting, so she knew that he was the caller once the ringtone sounded.

Leng Shaoting was the one Peng Yunlong had to ask for permission.

“What a coincidence! He just called me. Please excuse me for a while,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure,” Peng Yunlong said. He was curious to know who the person was.

Gu Ning picked up the call at once. “Hi, have you finished your task?”

“Yeah, where are you now?” Leng Shaoting asked.

Gu Ning had sent Leng Shaoting a message and told him that she was in the capital now, so he could read the message once he got off the plane.

“I’m at the Tangyun Teahouse now. How about you?” Gu Ning asked.

“I’ll be there in 20 minutes,” Leng Shaoting said. He wasn’t far from the Tangyun Teahouse.

“Great,” Gu Ning said, then hung up.

Afterwards, she turned to look at Peng Yunlong. “General Peng, the person you need to ask permission from is about to come. Would you mind waiting for him?”

“No problem,” Peng Yunlong said.

He had no plan to leave here right away after all.

Peng Yunlong then invited Gu Ning and the others to have a seat in the private room he booked.

Leng Shaoxun and Jiang Ruining felt uneasy, but Gu Ning stayed calm.

Actually, both Leng Shaoxun and Jiang Ruining were curious about the person, but it wasn’t appropriate for them to ask that question at this moment.

...

After hanging up the call with Gu Ning, Leng Shaoting called Master Leng.

“Hi, grandpa,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Are you back in the capital now?” Master Leng asked.

“Yes,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Great, come and dine with us along with Girl Gu this afternoon,” Master Leng said.

“I need to ask her first,” Leng Shaoting replied.

“She’s promised to visit me, so you must come home this afternoon to share a meal with me!” Master Leng said.

“I think I need to ask her for her opinion first. What if she’s busy this afternoon?” Leng Shaoting insisted. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Hearing that, Master Leng remembered that Gu Ning was a busy, successful businesswoman, so he agreed. “Fine, go ask her whether she’s free this afternoon.”

“I will,” Leng Shaoting said before he hung up.

...

Peng Yunlong asked Gu Ning when they were all seated in the private room, “Gu Ning, you told me that you love running businesses. How much do you know about it? It’s not easy to run a profitable company, and you might have outstanding debts.”

Gu Ning was just a high school student, so Peng Yunlong thought that she couldn’t know much about running a business.

Even the other people in the room held the same idea.

What Peng Yunlong just had said was also true.

Gu Ning smiled and said, “Well, I do know a little about running a business, but I can hire capable people to do it for me, and I can be the boss or investor.”

“How can you make sure that they will do their best and stay loyal to you?” Peng Yunlong asked.

“I actually want to ask you the same question, General Peng. Aren’t you afraid that I can’t stay loyal to you?” Gu Ning asked.

Peng Yunlong was struck dumb for a second, and didn’t know what to say. To his surprise, Gu Ning had the gift of gab.

Luo Zhanhua was amused seeing Peng Yunlong’s expression.

He hoped that Peng Yunlong could have such a talented girl be a member of the special forces, but he didn’t want Gu Ning to be forced to join the army.

“I didn’t know that you have the gift of gab!” Peng Yunlong said.

“Ha-ha.” Gu Ning laughed a little.

Peng Yunlong shook his head, and dropped this topic.

“Girl Gu, what industry are you going to be involved in?” Luo Zhanhua asked.

“Jewelry, antiques, real estate, hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, the entertainment industry, skincare products, and so forth. I’m doing them right now,” Gu Ning said.

Those were some industries that Gu Ning was already involved in right now, but they thought it was just her ambition.

“You’re really ambitious! Can you manage to do all of them? You must be down-to-earth,” Peng Yunlong said.

Although Gu Ning was indeed excellent at kung fu, he didn’t think that she could do so well at business too.

“I understand. To be honest with you, I’m already involved in those industries right now,” Gu Ning said with a smile.

“What?”

Hearing that, everyone was shocked.

“Yes, you heard me right,” Gu Ning said.

However, none of them could believe their ears.

If it was true, Gu Ning must be super rich!

“What are the names of your companies?” Peng Yunlong asked.

“Jade Beauty Jewelry, Xiangyun Antique-store, Kouzi, Colaine, and Fenghua Entertainment are my famous companies in the capital, while some are in other cities,” Gu Ning said.

“You’re the boss of them?” Luo Zhanhua was astonished, because those were all famous and popular companies in the capital these days.

Peng Yunlong didn’t know much about them, but he knew that they must be very influential seeing Luo Zhanhua’s expression.
