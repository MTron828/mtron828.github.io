Chapter 2019: Met a Savior

Although Gu Ning was her future daughter-in-law, it didn’t mean she would help her with everything, so she was very grateful for Gu Ning’s kindness. She needed to thank Gu Ning.

“You don’t need to say that. We’re a family,” said Gu Ning, feeling it was unnecessary. She didn’t care about it at all.

Shu Lihua soon walked out showing great excitement and happiness on her face. Although the cancer in her body wasn’t completely cured, she saw hope because of the medicine.

After a few minutes, Shu Lihua’s friend came. Shu Lihua explained to her friend why Jing Yunyao and the others came, and her friend was very considerate. Her friend couldn’t care less about it and Shu Lihua would pay the bill today anyway. She wouldn’t judge no matter whom Jing Yunyao brought to the meal.

However, the daughter of Shu Lihua’s friend was a little displeased the moment she saw Gu Ning. There was slight jealousy in her eyes.

The daughter of Shu Lihua’s friend was at the same age as Gu Ning. They were of the same height and she was pretty too, but Gu Ning was much prettier than her.

“Hi, my name’s Zheng Jiayu. I’m from City B. What’s your name? Where are you from?” Zheng Jiayu, the daughter of Shu Lihua’s friend, greeted Gu Ning first. She was very polite except for the evil thoughts showing in her eyes.

Gu Ning didn’t know what she was scheming, but she wasn’t afraid.

“Hi, my name’s Gu Ning. I also live in City B, but I’m studying in a college in the Capital now,” replied Gu Ning kindly. Even though she knew Zheng Jiayu was unkind to her, she had to be nice because Zheng Jiayu seemed to be kind, at least on the surface.

Hearing that, Zheng Jiayu stiffened for a second. She deliberately said that she came from City B to show off, but unexpectedly Gu Ning lived in City B as well. In addition, Gu Ning was studying in a college in the capital.

“Oh, may I know which college you’re studying in right now?” Zheng Jiayu asked, but she continued before Gu Ning could answer, “I’m studying in City B Jiao Tong University. I’m a sophomore this year. I originally planned to study in the capital as well, and my target was the Capital University, but I needed about a dozen points more to be accepted.”

Saying that, Zheng Jiayu seemed a little sad, but she actually felt very proud of herself. She didn’t think Gu Ning would be as good as her at studying.

City B’s Jiao Tong University was already a top university in City B and it ranked 6th in their country, and Gu Ning said she studied in the capital. There were only two universities ranked above City B Jiao Tong University in the capital, which were the Capital University and Huaxia University.

Only the top students could be accepted by the two universities, but top students were very few around the whole country!

Anyway, Zheng Jiayu refused to believe that Gu Ning could be accepted by either of the two universities. Unfortunately, the reality was quite the opposite of her thought.

“I’m studying in the Capital University,” said Gu Ning calmly, showing no pride or arrogance. She didn’t think it was worthwhile to show off.

All of a sudden, Zheng Jiayu was stunned. She couldn’t believe her ears.

What? Gu Ning is studying in the Capital University now? How is it possible that she’s so excellent at studying?

In an instant, Zheng Jiayu felt heavily hit and grew more jealous of Gu Ning, because Gu Ning wasn’t only beautiful, she was also excellent at studying.

However, although she was filled with jealousy, she had a good psychological quality, so she didn’t lose her manners. Within seconds, she calmed down and restricted the strong jealousy in her heart. “Wow, you’re so amazing! You made it to the Capital University!” She complimented Gu Ning.

Gu Ning smiled, but said nothing. Jing Yunyao, instead, joined in their conversation. “Yeah! Ningning is very outstanding. She was the top scorer with a full score at this year’s National College Entrance Examination. All the prestigious colleges around the country competed against each other for her, offering free tuition and accommodation.”

Mrs. Zheng and Shu Lihua didn’t see Zheng Jiayu’s scheme, so they thought that Zheng Jiayu really got along well with Gu Ning, but Jing Yunyao saw through Zheng Jiayu.

As a senior, she shouldn’t argue with a junior and Gu Ning wasn’t weak, but she was very protective, so she had to say something.

Shangguan Yang saw it as well, but he wasn’t so sensitive, so he said nothing.

“What? The top scorer with a full score?”

Hearing that, Zheng Jiayu, Mrs. Zheng, and Shu Lihua were all shocked.

“I heard about it, but I didn’t read the news carefully. I didn’t know it’s you, Miss Gu!” said Shu Lihua with a smile. She had a better impression of Gu Ning now.

“Miss Gu, you’re really amazing!” Mrs. Zheng complimented with sincerity.

“Thank you for your compliment,” said Gu Ning calmly.

Zheng Jiayu gave in completely right then. She stopped asking Gu Ning questions. To her surprise, she ran into a real top student.

If Zheng Jiayu learned about Gu Ning’s other skills, she would feel more shocked.

Dishes were soon placed on the table. Jing Yunyao, Shu Lihua, and Mrs. Zheng chatted with each other during the meal, while Gu Ning and Shangguan Yang kept on eating without a word. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Because of Gu Ning, Zheng Jiayu didn’t enjoy the food.

After having the meal, they separated.

While they were having the meal, Shu Lihua had asked Jing Yunyao why she came back this time.

Jing Yunyao said that she needed to deal with something, but she didn’t elaborate on that. Shu Lihua didn’t ask further about it, and only asked Jing Yunyao whether she planned to stay in City Ge for a day or go to County X right after having the meal.

Because City Ge wasn’t far from County X and it only take an hour on the road, it was convenient to go there at night.

Jing Yunyao said she would leave for County X right after having the meal, so Shu Lihua didn’t persuade Jing Yunyao to stay in case it would affect her schedule. Instead, Shu Lihua proposed to arrange for a car for them and Jing Yunyao accepted it.

Given their close relationship, they didn’t need to hesitate to accept each other’s help.

After that, Shu Lihua called her husband and asked him to arrange for a car. Therefore, once they walked out after the meal, there was already a car waiting for them outside.

They said good-bye to one another, then separated.

After about 10 minutes, Shu Lihua got home. Her husband, Zou Hongming, was greatly surprised to see her ruddy cheeks.

Seeing her husband’s shock, Shu Lihua said with a smile, “Darling, I met a savior.”

“Savior? What savior?” Zou Hongming was struck dumb. He couldn’t connect the savior to the fact that Shu Lihua suddenly looked healthier.

“You can see that my face has become ruddy and I’m full of energy now,” said Shu Lihua with a beam.

“What do you mean? What happened? Why do you suddenly…” Talking about that, Zou Hongming got excited.
