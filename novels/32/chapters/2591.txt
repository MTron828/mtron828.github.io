Chapter 2592: Completely Different

Hearing that question, Kang Yuannan felt humiliated, because Kang Shaojie didn’t trust him. Although he indeed had the intention of denying the result, he still felt embarrassed that Kang Shaojie spoke about that in public.

“Of course.” No matter how reluctant Kang Yuannan was, he had to admit it right now, or it might cause himself trouble.

However, he wouldn’t accept the failure.

“Great, we’ll have a meeting at 10 am tomorrow. I hope you all will be present,” said Kang Shaojie, putting pressure on them. He had to be strong enough to stop them from bullying him!

Kang Shaojie wasn’t weak, so Kang Yuannan and the other shareholders understood that he wasn’t easy to bully. However, Kang Yuannan still didn’t think he was important enough.

“We will,” said Kang Yuannan. Other shareholders immediately chimed in. It was a public place, so they had to appear respectful.

“Chairman Tang, is there anything else we need to know? If not, I think we need to leave first,” said Kang Yuannan on purpose.

“Nothing else,” said Kang Shaojie, then he watched them leave.

Kang Shaojie won, so his supporters were extremely happy. It was hard for them not to show their excitement.

It was just the beginning after he won and his future would only be harder, because all of them knew that Kang Yuannan wouldn’t stop making things difficult for him.

Gu Ning understood that just winning the game today couldn’t completely solve the problem for Kang Shaojie. She had to help him solve the underlying problem as well.

She had to first help Kang Yuanbo recover, so that he could continue to manage the company till Kang Shaojie had the ability to be in charge of it. They couldn’t give Kang Yuannan another chance to steal the business.

Gu Ning decided to help Kang Yuanbo recover, but not for free.

After Kang Yuannan left, Mr. Chen and Mr. Meng also walked away. The crowd dispersed too.

Without delay, Kang Shaojie ran to the backyard to call Gu Ning.

Once her phone rang, Gu Ning picked it up.

“Hi, Miss Gu, where are you now?” asked Kang Shaojie.

“I’m right here,” said Gu Ning.

“What?” Hearing that, Kang Shaojie was startled. He guessed that Gu Ning might be present, otherwise she wouldn’t be able to take a photo of the pile of raw jade materials, but he didn’t see her. “Why can’t I see you?” he asked.

“I put on make-up and look different now, so you failed to recognize me,” said Gu Ning.

Upon hearing that, Kang Shaojie figured out why Gu Ning changed her appearance.

Why didn’t he think of that before? When Gu Ning had the competition with him the day before yesterday and cut out two pieces of jade from five raw jade materials, she should have been targeted.

Although it wasn’t the most surprising result, it was still quite rare.

If it only happened once, it might just be luck, but Gu Ning had also cut out three pieces of jade from five raw jade materials in City Teng last time. And that was only what he knew about. There should be more he didn’t know about her. After all, Gu Ning started up her business by stone-gambling. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Kang Shaojie didn’t collect much information about Gu Ning, because he didn’t know many of her achievements.

“Miss Gu, since you’re here, I bet you haven’t eaten yet, right? I can leave now. Why don’t we go have a meal together?” said Kang Shaojie. Gu Ning had done him a big favor, and he didn’t think what he had done for her was enough to return her kindness. However, he didn’t know how to do that, so he could only buy her a meal to show his gratitude.

“Great, there are three of us now. Two girls and a man. We are all in black suits,” said Gu Ning.

Two girls and a man in black suits? Hearing that, Kang Shaojie immediately remembered them. He just saw them, but didn’t recognize Gu Ning.

Gu Ning and Baili Zongxue looked completely different after disguising themselves.

“Great, see you then,” said Kang Shaojie. He hung up and walked out of the backyard.

Back in the hall, he glanced around and saw Gu Ning at once. The next moment, he walked towards her.

Even though he walked closer, Kang Shaojie still thought that this girl before him was different from Gu Ning. After observing the girl for a while longer, he slightly believed that she was Gu Ning.

Actually, he was unfamiliar with Gu Ning. If they were more familiar, it would be much easier for him to recognize her.

“Miss Gu, you look completely different now. I just saw you, but I didn’t recognize you. If you didn’t tell me, I would hardly notice you!” Kang Shaojie joked. At the same time, he was amazed by the effect of make-up.

“That’s exactly what I want. If you could easily recognize me, it would be troublesome,” said Gu Ning with a smile. Then she introduced Kang Shaojie to Leng Shaoting. “Oh, this is my fiancé. His surname is Leng.”

Kang Shaojie greeted Leng Shaoting right away. “Nice to meet you, Mr. Leng.”

He was stunned by the outstanding appearance of Gu Ning’s fiancé. Her fiancé had to be born in a powerful family given his natural air of nobility.

“Nice to meet you too, Mr. Kang.” Leng Shaoting replied.

Although Leng Shaoting looked cold, Mr. Kang didn’t think he was disdainful because he could see that Leng Shaoting was used to keeping his distance from other people.

After that, they walked out, leaving the jade to the manager of the store.

The manager was Kang Yuanbo’s henchman, so he was trustworthy.

Shortly after they left the store, Gu Ning felt that someone was following them. To be specific, she felt that Kang Shaojie was the target.

It was true that the person came to follow Kang Shaojie. And the person was sent by Kang Yuannan.

Gu Ning didn’t bother to tell Kang Shaojie yet. It wasn’t a big deal that the person followed them. Anyway, he couldn’t hear them.

It was nearly 2 pm, so they didn’t walk far, instead they went to a restaurant out of the raw jade material market.

It was the best restaurant nearby, and they ordered a private room.

The person followed them to the restaurant. After they walked into the private room, he couldn’t see or hear them, so he went back to the hall downstairs.

If he wandered outside their private room, he would get in trouble if he was exposed.

He decided to continue to follow them after they left.
