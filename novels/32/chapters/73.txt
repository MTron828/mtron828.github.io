Chapter 75: Too Sensitive

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

When a waiter opened the door, Gu Ning glimpsed as a group of men walked by. She unexpectedly found she was familiar with the front man’s figure.

However when she looked over, they were gone.

Gu Ning didn’t know many men, and even less of them could leave an unforgettable impression on her. Thus she immediately knew who he was.

The man must be the one who had given her the King’s Green. What a coincidence! He was here too.

Gu Ning didn’t bother to think further about it. She moved her sight back to the menu. She ordered two dished then gave the menu back to Zhou Zhenghong. “Uncle Zhou, please help yourself and order something you like.”

Zhou Zhenghong took the menu. He ordered two dishes as well then handed the menu to the waiter.

When the waiter left, Zhou Zhenghong immediately took out a file paper-bag, giving it to Gu Ning. “Boss, I’ve set up the contract. Please have a look. If there is anything you think is inappropriate, I can adjust it.”

“Great.” Gu Ning took it. She opened the paper-bag and started to read the document inside.

With her powerful Jade Eyes, it was super easy for Gu Ning to read through the contract quickly, but in front of Zhou Zhenghong, Gu Ning had to pretend. She deliberately spent more time on the papers to make it seem natural.

The contract only had two pages so although Gu Ning slowed down her reading pace on purpose, she still finished it in two minutes.

The labor contract between Gu Ning and Zhou Zhenghong said that Zhou Zhenghong was the executive director of the Jade Beauty Jewelry Company. He had absolute right of discourse. The registered capital of the Jade Beauty Jewelry Company was a hundred million yuan. In addition to the monthly salary, Zhou Zhenghong also owned 20% of the shares of the Jade Beauty Jewelry Company.

“Well, I think it’s good,” Gu Ning said. She signed her name in Party A, and then handed it to Zhou Zhenghong. Zhou Zhenghong also signed his name.

Gu Ning couldn’t help using her Jade Eyes to see into the private room next door. She saw those men that she saw in the elevator and another group of men sat across a table. There were two black boxes on the table in front of the two groups.

They were in a luxurious restaurant with great insulation so she couldn’t hear anything because they weren’t speaking loudly.

She could only see what they were doing.

They opened the boxes. One of them was full of bags of white powder, while the other was filled with piles of bills and gold bars.

Apparently, they were in the middle of a deal.

Although Gu Ning knew they were doing something illegal, she knew she shouldn’t get involved.

Moreover, there were at least 10 men with guns. Gu Ning wasn’t powerful enough to fight against them.

Gu Ning brought her sight back, lifting the tea cup to drink a sip.

However, in the private room adjacent to the private room next door, there were three men. One of them was Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting was dressed in black clothes. He was tall and expressionless.

He was wearing earphones listening to the sound from the adjacent room and was monitoring the conversation.

Meanwhile, a young man walked over, talking to Leng Shaoting, “Captain, except for us and the enemies, there are also people in another private room on this floor. It’s room No.3 which is right next to our enemies’ room. I’ve already informed the manager to get them to leave.”

“Great,” Leng Shaoting answered lightly and said nothing else.

Because they didn’t know their enemies’ appointed place beforehand, they weren’t well prepared in advance. They could only check the surrounding situation after the appointed place had been confirmed. Even the bug was secretly set by one of Leng Shaoting’s men who had disguised himself as a waiter.

Knock, knock.

At that moment, the door of Gu Ning’s private room was knocked on and was then pushed open.

Gu Ning though it was the waiter; but to her surprise, two men who were around 30 walked in. Both Gu Ning and Zhou Zhenghong frowned a little.

One of the men was full of regrets saying, “Nice to meet you, miss and sir. I’m the hotel manager. I’m so sorry to bother you for a special condition.”

The man with the hotel manager walked in front of Gu Ning. He took out a document and handed it to Gu Ning. He said, “Nice to meet you both. This is my certificate as a military officer. Our military is currently carrying out a task on this floor. For your safety, I hope you can immediately move to a private room upstairs. Sorry about that.”

Knowing that, Zhou Zhenghong was completely shocked while Gu Ning was merely a little surprised. It must have something to do with the people in the next room.

However could the man be from the military? Well, the man did look like a military man.

“Sure.” Gu Ning didn’t want to be involved either. She answered then left with Zhou Zhenghong, following the hotel manager and the military officer.

However just as they left the room, the two men standing outside room No.4 immediately looked over. The hotel manager suddenly panicked. His face turned pale at once because he clearly knew that the suspect was right in that private room.

Both Gu Ning and the officer knew that something bad might happen. The reaction of the hotel manager was likely to attract the attention of those men. The officer immediately took a step forward and blocked the hotel manager. He gave the manager a warning look.

However the two people who were outside had already seen the manager’s face. They sensed something must be wrong right away. They called out, “Wait.”

The hotel manager trembled, but because of the officer’s warning look, he forced himself to calm down and immediately put on a formulaic smile. “Nice to meet you sir. What can I do for you?” He asked the person who called him.

The two men exchanged a knowing look, then walked towards them.

Both Gu Ning and the officer were alert. They knew things could go wrong. But they were afraid to raise suspicion, so they decided to temporarily stand still.

The two men walked over, then immediately took out guns aiming at them. “Get in!” they snapped quietly.

The hotel manager and Zhou Zhenghong’s faces immediately turned pale. They were trembling from the terror.

Gu Ning and the military officer stayed calm instead; but again to not raise suspicion, they cooperated well and showed fear on their faces.

They were all forced back into the private room.

Room No.5 was where Leng Shaoting stayed. He had set cameras outside, so he was able to see what was going on.

“Captain, what should we do? They’re so sensitive!” a man said worriedly.

“Be patient,” Leng Shaoting said. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Leng Shaoting didn’t miss the relatively smaller figure among them. He was a little upset and uneasy. It seemed that he was concerned about her safety.

In room No.3.

“You just saw us. Why did you look so scared?” a suspect asked the hotel manager. He recognized the hotel manager, so he was particularly sensitive.
