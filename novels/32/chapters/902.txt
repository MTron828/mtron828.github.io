903 He Hongyuan Is Caugh

He Hongjie hadn’t come to He Hongyuan’s place before precisely because He Hongyuan had control of He Siyang. However, things were different now.

“He Hongjie, what are you doing in my place?” He Hongyuan questioned He Hongjie.

“What do you think?” He Hongjie stared at He Hongyuan with a cold face.

“How could I know what you are doing?” He Hongyuan said.

“He Hongyuan, you abducted Siyang and hurt my hearing on purpose!” He Hongjie raised his voice.

He Hongyuan squinted, but denied it. “Do you have any proof to prove that?”

“I don’t, but I know it’s you,” He Hongjie said.

“Well, interesting. Since you don’t have any proof, it’s slander.” He Hongyuan argued.

“Really?” He Hongjie sneered. “I don’t care about proof, because I know that you’ve done everything you could to hurt my family, and you must pay for what you’ve done.”

“You...” He Hongyuan was mad. “He Hongjie, you don’t have proof, and it’s illegal for you to hurt me!”

He Hongyuan said that because he was confident that He Hongjie couldn’t find any proof.

“I don’t care!” He Hongjie sneered again, then gave an order. “Take them back to the He family’s ancestral shrine!”

Once they were taken back to the He family’s ancestral shrine, it would be family affairs. As long as they weren’t killed, even the police couldn’t interfere in it. He Hongjie could also lock them up forever.

In fact, He Hongjie had no intention to kill them, because it wasn’t a good thing after all and would damage their family’s reputation.

“You...” He Hongyuan wanted to struggle, but he was just an old man.

In the end, He Hongyuan and He Yixi were caught.

...

Hong Yuefei didn’t pay attention to the He family’s problem at all, because he was still resting in his house recovering. To be specific, he was having fun.

He Yixi told him that she wasn’t free today, so Hong Yuefei called two prostitutes over to serve him. He had sex with them till he was exhausted, then went to have some sleep before he had sex with them again. He didn’t feel bored at all.

In the evening, Hong Yuefei suddenly remembered the He family’s problem and called He Yixi, but he couldn’t get through to her. He then called his older brother asking about the He family’s condition.

Hong Yuehuan told him that He Hongyuan had lost the competition, and warned him not to socialize with He Yixi anymore.

Hong Yuefei listened to Hong Yuehuan this time.

Actually, Hong Yuefei didn’t have much affection towards He Yixi; he just liked her performance in bed when they had sex. He knew that his family’s benefits were much more important than a girlfriend, so he decided to dump He Yixi. He didn’t lack women anyway.

Hong Shitian thought for a whole day, but still didn’t want to apologize in person. Instead, he called He Hongjie that afternoon.

Although He Hongjie was disappointed in Hong Shitian, he knew that he shouldn’t have a grudge against the Tiandihui. The Tiandihui was an influential gang in HK after all, and it could be very helpful in the future.

He Hongjie wouldn’t stop cooperating with them in business, but they wouldn’t be as close as usual anymore.

...

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting left together after the meal.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya also went on a date, while He Siyin and Xu Jinlin were left alone. However, He Siyin needed to go home, and Xu Jinlin had to go to an appointment as well, so they didn’t care about it.

“Oh, when will you go back to your city?” Xu Jinlin asked before they left.

“We’ll leave for City M tomorrow,” Leng Shaoting said. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Great, I’m going to the capital tomorrow; remember to call me when you’re both in the capital,” Xu Jinlin said.

“We will,” Leng Shaoting said.

After that, they separated.

“Why don’t we go for a walk?” Gu Ning said to Leng Shaoting.

“Sure.” Leng Shaoting held Gu Ning’s hand while walking out of the hotel.

...

Cao Wenxin took a plane to the capital to visit Xin Bei that afternoon.

Xin Bei stayed in the capital these days, and Cao Wenxin was free, so she went to visit him.

Xin Bei was waiting for her when she got off the flight.

They went to dine together later, but ran into Yu Wenjing and Yu Wenkang in the restaurant.

Yu Wenjing didn’t leave the hospital until today, and Yu Wenkang brought her out to have some delicious food in order to cheer her up. To his surprise, they encountered Xin Bei and Cao Wenxin.

The second Yu Wenjing saw Cao Wenxin and Xin Bei, she burst into tears.

“Wenjing.” Yu Wenkang stopped her.

Yu Wenjing understood that she shouldn’t argue with the girl beside Xin Bei, so she had to swallow her sadness.

Xin Bei’s and Cao Wenxin’s moods were affected when they saw Yu Wenjing, but they directly ignored her.

After the meal, they went for a walk, then Xin Bei brought Cao Wenxin back to his apartment.

In the beginning, Cao Wenxin was unwilling to go to Xin Bei’s place, and told Xin Bei to send her back to the Huangdeng Hotel, but Xin Bei disagreed.

Xin Bei said, “We can only share some time together this afternoon and tonight. If you chase me away right now, our date will be too short!”

Cao Wenxin understood that they didn’t have much private time, so she nodded in the end.

Nevertheless, if they stayed alone in the same room, it was unavoidable to have sex. Although they had already made love before, Cao Wenxin still felt shy and uneasy thinking about it.

“Am I your boyfriend or not?” Xin Bei looked sad.

“Of course!” Cao Wenxin said.

“Go back to my place with me, please.” Xin Bei almost begged.

Cao Wenxin didn’t want to hurt his heart, so she agreed.

Xin Bei beamed with happiness.
