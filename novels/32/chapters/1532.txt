Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Several hours later, Gao Yi and Zhao Binxu were back with a check for twenty million yuan.

Zhao Binxu looked excited when he met Gu Ning in the company. It wasn’t easy for him to get his money back, and he almost committed suicide because of it.

“Boss, thank you so much!” Zhao Binxu thanked Gu Ning again.

Without Gu Ning’s help, he might be bankrupt or dead already.

“You’re welcome, and you can buy a house now with your money,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure.” Zhao Binxu smiled. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Gu Ning went to meet Baili Zongxue that afternoon so she left her company earlier than usual.

She didn’t go with Gao Yi and Qiao Ya this time, but told them to lead Wu Shunhua away before she appeared.

Gu Ning and Qiao Ya were aware that someone was always following Gu Ning. At the beginning, they even blamed themselves for it because they couldn’t help Gu Ning get rid of Wu Shunhua, but Gu Ning told them that Wu Shunhua was a cultivator. They were merely mortals after all. Even though they were top profession killers, they were no match for cultivators.

When Gao Yi and Qiao Ya drove Gu Ning’s car away, Wu Shunhua indeed followed them again, then Gu Ning drove another car out. This car was from City F, so the number plate showed that it was from City F.

Gu Ning didn’t rush to see Baili Zongxue, but she was already used to driving fast. Because she was excellent at driving, she could skillfully overtake other cars or cut into another lane.

However, when she once again cut into another lane in front of a luxurious car, the owner of the luxurious car was furious. He was a young man and refused to swallow the anger, so he decided to teach Gu Ning a lesson.

There was a lot of traffic on the road, but it wasn’t very crowded, so he accelerated and tried to force Gu Ning to stop her car.

Gu Ning didn’t pay attention to him until he tried to force her to stop her car. She realized that the man must be mad at her behavior earlier. However, Gu Ning didn’t care at all, because the man wasn’t as skilled at racing as she was. Without hesitation, Gu Ning sped up as well and left the luxurious car behind.

The young owner of the luxurious car was struck dumb for a second, then chased after her at once. Unfortunately, no matter how fast he drove, there was always a distance between him and Gu Ning.

Other drivers on the road kept criticizing them, because it was very dangerous.

The young owner of the luxurious car chased Gu Ning for five minutes till they reached the Jinlin Hotel.

Gu Ning gradually slowed down and he finally had a chance to catch up with her.

Seeing the luxurious car following her to the Jinlin Hotel, Gu Ning frowned. She threw her car key to a valet parker, then walked straight into the hotel.

“Hey, stop right there!” the young man shouted at her.

Gu Ning heard him, but didn’t want to talk with him. Coincidentally, he was going to have a meal in Jinlin Hotel too.

Gu Ning knew that he wouldn’t let her go easily, so she stopped all of a sudden, then turned around to face him.

Because Gu Ning stopped all of a sudden, the young man lost his balance and bumped into her.

Other people were scared seeing the scene, because it must be very painful.

The man was also scared by Gu Ning’s abrupt halt, but he was amazed by her face the moment she turned to face him.

The next second, Gu Ning pressed her phone against his chest to stop him from bumping into her. She looked arrogant, but not hateful.

The young man was still amazed by Gu Ning’s beauty, and didn’t know what to say. He had seen many beautiful women before, but Gu Ning was even prettier than all the women he had seen before.

Gu Ning wasn’t only stunning, she also had an air of unusual confidence.

“Sir, may I help?” Gu Ning said.

“Um, n-nothing.” The man totally forgot what he wanted to do.

“Fine.” Gu Ning turned back and walked away without hesitation. She was unwilling to waste time on him. However, when Gu Ning was leaving, the young man suddenly remembered what he wanted to do.

“Hey, wait!” He stopped her again.

Although Gu Ning was gorgeous, it didn’t mean that he could let her get away with it like that. In fact, he was having a struggle in his mind. He didn’t know whether he should let Gu Ning get away with it or not.
