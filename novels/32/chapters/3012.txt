3015 Isn’t It Serious Enough?

“If you’re suspicious of me, you won’t believe me no matter what I say. So, only time can prove it.” Leng Xiaoyao said, “Actually, I planned to relieve Mr. Li’s suspicions, but now it seems that my explanation has only made it worse. Anyway, I honestly have no intention of harming you. But Mr. Li, you better be more careful. I can foresee the future in my dreams.”

Hearing that, they wondered whether Leng Xiaoyao caused Li Mochen to be injured?

If there was a connection, why did she remind him to be careful?

It was possible that Leng Xiaoyao did that for a purpose. Perhaps she wanted to win Li Mochen’s trust, but Li Mochen was less suspicious of Leng Xiaoyao, because he indeed needed to do a very dangerous task these days.

He hadn’t told anyone about it yet, and he didn’t know the destination. He wasn’t even sure where he was going. Therefore, it was impossible for Leng Xiaoyao to know beforehand.

In that case, Leng Xiaoyao might really have special abilities, and her words might be true.

However, he still remained doubtful, so he didn’t reply to her.

Leng Xiaoyao said nothing further. After they arrived at the hospital, she got out of the car and thanked Li Mochen, before hurriedly leaving.

“Boss, I think there must be something wrong with this girl. She might have bad intentions,” the chauffeur said.

“Alright, we still have time. Let’s go to the airport now,” Li Mochen said. He didn’t want to talk about Leng Xiaoyao.

“Yes, sir.” The chauffeur answered, then immediately drove to the airport. He didn’t bother to say more about Leng Xiaoyao, because Li Mochen could deal with it. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

…

After Leng Xiaoyao got out of the car, she took out her phone and called Leng Yecheng at once. She asked him where he was right now.

At this time, Leng Yecheng was treating his wound in the emergency room, so Leng Xiaoyao directly ran there.

Leng Yecheng wasn’t seriously injured, but his injuries weren’t minor either. He didn’t need to have an operation. He could still move his hands and talk, but it was difficult.

He was still a little dizzy now, but he did his best to stay awake, so that he wouldn’t pass out.

His right leg was also broken. He had it in a cast, but he had to use a wheelchair for the next month.

On the other hand, Leng Yecheng’s secretary, Chen Yuxi, was seriously injured. He had a concussion after the crash and was in a coma now. Both of his legs had been injured. Although his legs weren’t dislocated or broken, his left leg was injured by pieces of broken glass.

When Leng Xiaoyao saw Leng Yecheng, she felt like crying. “Doctor, how’s my uncle’s condition?” She asked the doctor at once.

The doctor introduced Leng Yecheng’s condition to Leng Xiaoyao. Hearing that Leng Yecheng wasn’t seriously injured, she was relieved.

“Alright, don’t be sad. I’m fine.” Leng Yecheng comforted Leng Xiaoyao when he saw that she looked so upset.

“You’re fine? You hit your head, and your leg is broken. Isn’t that serious enough? Do you think it’s serious only when you have been handicapped?” Leng Xiaoyao was mad. She cared about Leng Yecheng a lot, so she wouldn’t allow him to take it lightly.

Leng Yecheng didn’t feel embarrassed or mad after being lectured by Leng Xiaoyao. Instead, he felt very touched.

“Alright, alright, don’t be mad. No one wanted the accident to happen! I had good luck and survived this time,” Leng Yecheng said.

“Did you tell grandpa?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Not yet, I didn’t want to worry him, so I haven’t told him yet,” Leng Yecheng said.

“Were you alone or was there anyone else with you?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Secretary Chen was with me, but he’s seriously injured. He has a relatively serious concussion and is still in a coma now. Both of his legs were compressed. His left leg was also injured by pieces of broken glass. Luckily, his life is safe,” Leng Yecheng said. Speaking of Chen Yuxi, he was really sad.

“The wound has been treated. You can go to the ward now,” the doctor announced.

Afterwards, Leng Xiaoyao followed Leng Yecheng to the ward.

Leng Yecheng stayed in a single room, because he needed quiet.

Chen Yuxi’s ward was right next to his, and it was also a single room.

There was an attendant in the ward, so Leng Yecheng didn’t inform Chen Yuxi’s family immediately. Most importantly, he just went to deal with his wound, so he decided to do it after he finished and returned to the ward.

“Uncle, tell me how the accident happened,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t think it was an accident, so she wanted to conduct an investigation.

“A truck was out of control and hit us, then we hit the back of the big car in front of us,” Leng Yecheng said.

“And? What did the truck driver say?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“He said that he had been driving for a long time, so he was exhausted. He didn’t know how it happened. He had a good attitude and agreed to pay the compensation,” Leng Yecheng said.

“Do you know his basic information, like his name, age, height, place of birth, and his license plate?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

Leng Yecheng didn’t think further about it and answered. “His name is Zhang Jinhua. He’s about forty years old, slightly taller than 1.7m, about 75 kilograms. He said he’s from County Yanhua. His license plate is XXXXX.”

“Uncle, do you think it was an accident?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

Hearing that, Leng Yecheng was surprised and asked, “Do you mean it’s not?”

At the beginning, he didn’t think much about it, but now he felt it might have been a scheme.

They didn’t have a delusional disorder, but sometimes they had to be careful. After all, they were in a special situation right now.

“It’s just my suspicion, but we need to do an investigation. If it’s an accident, you had bad luck. If not, we must pay the mastermind back,” Leng Xiaoyao said aggressively. Even Leng Yecheng was frightened by her power.

His niece suddenly became so powerful that he could barely take the pressure, but she looked very cool.
