Chapter 1767: Disappear by Itself

Not every rich man owned wealth in the billions or dozens of billions of yuan. People who had dozens or hundreds of millions of yuan were also very rich. Therefore, whenever they went outside, there were one or two people by their sides.

They were old people after all, and might be in danger.

Although Shangguan Yang was a cultivator at a very high level and no one was his match in the cultivation world and mortals’ world, Stone was by his side. Stone wasn’t worried that Shangguan Yang might be in trouble, it was simply his job.

As Shangguan Yang’s assistant, he couldn’t rely on Shangguan Yang to protect himself.

During this time, Stone also learned a lot from Shangguan Yang and made great progress when it came to his kung fu skills. Stone felt grateful to him. However, he didn’t take Shangguan Yang as his master, because Shangguan Yang was already Leng Shaoting’s master. Therefore, he wasn’t qualified to be Shangguan Yang’s disciple and be in the same position as Leng Shaoting.

Actually, it was Stone’s own idea, but Shangguan Yang indeed wouldn’t be willing to accept him as his disciple, because Stone was just a mortal, not a cultivator. Instead, Shangguan Yang could teach Stone kung fu skills, as long as he wanted to learn and could learn them well. If Stone wasn’t able to use the skills he learned, it wasn’t necessary for him to learn them. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Shangguan Yang walked slowly from the park to the siheyuan. Within 10 minutes, he arrived home, because the park was only hundreds of meters away on the same street.

Because Lao Zhang made a lot of food every time, Shangguan Yang didn’t specially tell him to make more food when Gu Ning came to share a meal with them. It was enough for them to fill their stomachs.

Even if the food wasn’t enough, it didn’t matter if he ate less. He had left the mountain for a long time, and his appetite had become smaller and smaller. He now didn’t eat as much as before.

He ate a lot for a short time right after leaving the mountain, because he hadn’t had such delicious food for ages. As he began to eat more and more delicious food, he gradually became accustomed to it.

Although, Shangguan Yang could still eat as much food as three people. He used to eat as much food as five people.

...

At 11:30 am, Gu Ning arrived.

“Hi, Grandpa Shangguan, how are you recently?” Gu Ning asked with concern.

“Not bad, I go out and play Elephant chess with those old men these days!” said Shangguan Yang.

“That’s wonderful! You won’t be bored like that, because I have my business to deal with and I’ll be going to my university in a few days. I’m afraid I won’t have much time to visit you,” said Gu Ning.

“It’s fine. You can deal with your own business. I’m not a kid anyway, and I can enjoy myself,” said Shangguan Yang. He didn’t feel bored at all now.

Actually, he was quite busy now. He needed to read, do cultivation, play Elephant chess with those old men in the park, or fish every day.

There was a pond in the park and people could fish.

“Oh, what do you want to talk about with me?” Shangguan Yang asked all of a sudden.

“Um, isn’t it true that ghosts can’t touch concrete things? Do you know any ways to make ghosts be able to do that?” asked Gu Ning.

“It’s easy. I have a Taoist magic figure with me. As long as it’s attached to the ghost, the ghost will have 15 minutes to be an entity, so it can touch concrete things. After 15 minutes, the ghost will return to its original being and it won’t be able to touch concrete things anymore,” Shangguan Yang said, then asked, “Why do you ask for that? Did you encounter anything?”

Knowing that Shangguan Yang had a way to solve the problem, Gu Ning’s eyes lit up with excitement. Facing his question, Gu Ning chose to be honest and said, “The thing is that I hung out with my friends the other day and we encountered a male ghost. I put it away into my space. It’s not allowed to stay in the mortal world, and it will affect human beings if it isn’t eliminated, so I want to solve this problem. Although I can directly destroy its soul and make it unable to be reincarnated, I’m afraid it’ll bring me bad luck. Therefore, I think I can probably help it to give up its obsession and let it disappear on its own. If it’s successfully reincarnated, it’ll bring me good luck. However, if it refuses to give up its obsession, I’ll ruin its soul. The obsession of that male ghost is a token of his wife’s love. It’s kept in another person’s grave, so the male ghost has guarded there for a long time. Only when it gets that piece of jade, will its obsession be eliminated.”

“Great, you’ve made a smart decision. It isn’t important whether it can bring you good luck if you make the male ghost disappear by itself, but it can bring you bad luck. If it happens once or twice, it won’t matter, but it’ll have a great impact if it happens many times,” said Shangguan Yang. Then he raised his hand and a Taoist magic figure showed up in the air. He handed it to Gu Ning. “Take this and help the male ghost get the token so that it can give up its obsession and leave our world on its own.”

“Thanks, Grandpa Shangguan,” Gu Ning said and took the Taoist magic figure and put it into her telepathic eye space.

When it was almost 12 pm, Lao Zhang prepared the dishes well. Gu Ning and Shangguan Yang began to enjoy lunch together.

Afterwards, Gu Ning stayed with Shangguan Yang for a while, before going back to her company.

She needed to wait to deal with the male ghost in the haunted house till later at night, because there would be nobody at that time.

However, the flood dragon wasn’t by her side now, and Gu Ning needed to figure out a way to get into the grave under the haunted house. If it was deep beneath the ground, it would be impossible for her to dig inside.

Accordingly, Gu Ning let the monster fox out.

Because she was in the car, she directly put the monster fox on the rear seats.

Once the monster fox was out, it found the car was moving, but it didn’t know what it was, so it was scared and asked, “What is this?”

“A car,” said Gu Ning.

“What is a car?” the monster fox asked.

“Do you know carriage?” asked Gu Ning.

“Yeah,” said the monster fox.

“This is a car. Just like a horse-drawn carriage, it has wheels and moves on them. However, horse-drawn carriages are pulled by horses, but cars are driven by burning oil. I don’t know how to explain it further to you, so whether you know it or not, it doesn’t matter. There is no need for you to continue to ask about it,” Gu Ning said. She didn’t know the principle either, and didn’t bother to elaborate on that, because the monster fox might not be able to understand it and it would be a total waste of time.

When Gu Ning compared the carriage with the car, the monster fox knew what it meant. Since Gu Ning told it not to ask further about it, it stopped.

“Can you dig the soil? Deep down into the ground?” Gu Ning asked.

“Of course, it’s easy!” the monster fox said. It was displeased when Gu Ning doubted its ability.

“How long will it take to dig into the ground 20 meters deep?” Gu Ning asked.

“About half an hour,” said the monster fox.

It was quite fast, but the flood dragon could finish that within minutes. Unfortunately, the flood dragon followed Leng Shaoting to the military base, so Gu Ning could only rely on the monster fox.
