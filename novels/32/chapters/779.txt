780 The Kirin Gang Won“t Protect You

Those hoodlums were all beaten down on the ground, moaning in pain after a few minutes.

“Goddess Gu, you’re so awesome!”

“Indeed. The three of us just beat one down by working together, but you alone beat five!”

“That’s nothing. A group of security guards weren’t even a match for Goddess Gu either!”

“You’re right!”

Tong Chao and his friends all complimented Gu Ning.

Gu Ning smiled, but didn’t say anything.

“Do you know who we are? We’re members of the Kirin Gang. If you dare to hurt us, the Kirin Gang won’t let you get away with it!” A hoodlum threatened them.

Although they were policemen, the Kirin Gang never cared about junior policemen without much power.

“Oh, really?” Gu Ning sneered. “I know that you are members of the Kirin Gang, but you’re just a bunch of unimportant trash in the gang. I think that the Kirin Gang won’t protect you.”

“You...”

Hearing that, those hoodlums panicked, because Gu Ning told the truth. They used the Kirin Gang’s name to bully others, but the Kirin Gang wouldn’t protect them if they were caught. Now, they believed that Gu Ning had the ability to punish them as she wanted.

“W-what do you want to do?” a hoodlum asked with fear.

“You’ve damaged my shop and you must pay for it,” Gu Ning said. “Follow us to the police station and tell us who the mastermind is, then pay the compensation which is two million yuan in all.”

Hearing that, those hoodlums understood that Gu Ning came here for the beauty salon. They were surprised that Gu Ning was able to find them within such a short time, and they were also shocked by the amount of money they had to pay.

Two million yuan! They were just a bunch of jobless hoodlums. How were they going to pay the two million yuan? They couldn’t even afford two hundred thousand yuan!

They could just get fifty thousand yuan as the fee for helping the Zheng family damage Gu Ning’s shop, because their leader took a large share of the pay.

“W-we don’t have that much money,” a hoodlum said.

“If you can’t pay it, you’ll be put in jail,” Gu Ning said.

“No!” Those hoodlums were scared.

“C-can you give us a day to collect the money?” another hoodlum asked.

“Right, please give us a day, and we’ll pay it!”

They would rather pay the money than be put in jail.

Gu Ning wasn’t someone that they could mess with, so they chose to listen to her.

“No way.” Gu Ning refused. “If you can’t pay the compensation, you can take a video and tell us who sent you to damage my shop in it, and I’ll go find the person behind you.”

Even though they had mentioned the Zheng family when they went to damage the shop, Gu Ning didn’t have solid proof, like a recording or video of it. Without solid proof, she couldn’t ask for legal compensation.

Compared with causing the Zheng family trouble without many people knowing about it, Gu Ning preferred to embarrass them in public. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“What?” Those hoodlums felt cornered.

Gu Ning, however, lost her patience. “Are you doing it or not? I don’t have time to waste on you.”

“Miss Gu, it was a task assigned to us by our leader, and we don’t know the details. He just told us that it’s the Zheng family’s order,” a hoodlum said. He had no intention to abdicate his responsibility, but it was the truth.

“Oh, what’s your leader’s name and where is he right now?” Gu Ning asked.

“His name is Liu Zhongming, and he’s in the Earth Nightclub,” the hoodlum said. He didn’t want to betray his leader, but he was left with no choice.

“Great, let’s go to the Earth Nightclub together then,” Gu Ning said, and she meant everyone.

“Goddess Gu...” Tong Chao and the other two were worried, because the Earth Nightclub was the Kirin Gang’s place! They trusted Gu Ning, but they were still afraid of the Kirin Gang.

“It’s fine,” Gu Ning said to comfort them.

Since Gu Ning said so, they relaxed a little.

After that, those hoodlums helped one another get back on their feet and walked outside.

Tong Chao dove their van, and Gu Ning sat with them, in case they escaped, while Wu Xuanjie and Hu Yiming drove the police car following them.

Gu Ning couldn’t help but think that she didn’t get along with the Earth Nightclub, because she had encountered a lot of trouble in which it was involved.

She didn’t want to waste time, so she directly called Manager Lu.

Manager Lu had given Gu Ning his name card, and told her to call him if she needed help in the Earth Nightclub.

“Hi, Manager Lu, it’s Gu Ning, and I need your help now,” Gu Ning said once the call was answered.

“Hi, Miss Gu, what can I do for you?” Manager Lu said.

“Is there a man called Liu Zhongming in your gang? He sent several men to damage my shop, so I need to talk to him. I’m on my way to the Earth Nightclub now,” Gu Ning said calmly.

Manager Lu was displeased after hearing it, and said with a serious face, “Miss Gu, don’t worry, I promise that I’ll handle it well. Tian will see you at the door.”

Tian was precisely Tian Ge who was Manager Lu’s bodyguard.

“Thanks,” Gu Ning said and hung up.

Those hoodlums exchanged a glance with one another after hearing Gu Ning’s conversation with Manager Lu on the phone. If this Manager Lu was the Manager Lu working in the Earth Nightclub, they would be doomed.

The eight hoodlums took a long breath in, and realized that they had made a terrible mistake today.

“Um, M-Miss Gu, we just did it according to our leader’s order. Would you please forgive us this time?”

“Please, we’re already seriously injured.”

...

They began to beg Gu Ning, but Gu Ning remained silent along the way.
