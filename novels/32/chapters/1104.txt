Chapter 1105 K Stands Up

“Alright, where are you now? I’ll be on my way,” Xu Qinyin said.“I’m leaving for XX Road, and my destination is XX building. Call me when you arrive there,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure, I’ll be right there,” Xu Qinyin said.

“Oh, don’t drive your car. Just take a taxi,” Gu Ning said, because they already had a large car.

“Great.” Xu Qinyin didn’t want to drive either.

Without delay, Xu Qinyin left her bed and changed her clothes.

Normally, it took about half an hour for her to put on her make-up, but she finished it within 20 minutes today.

Xu Qinyin’s mother was surprised when she got up of her own accord.

“Qinyin, where are you going?” her mother asked.

“Gu Ning just called me, and we’re going to hang out together,” Xu Qinyin said.

“Gu Ning called you? No wonder you’re willing to get up by yourself,” Xu Qinyin’s mother said.

Only Gu Ning was so influential.

Although Xu Qinyin’s mother hadn’t met Gu Ning yet, she had heard a lot about Gu Ning and what Gu Ning had done.

Master Xu often talked about Gu Ning as well, and Xu Qinyin also complimented Gu Ning many times.

Gu Ning was a very successful businesswoman at such an early age, and it was hard for others not to admire her ability. Therefore, Xu Qinyin’s mother had a good impression of Gu Ning.

What surprised her more was that Gu Ning became Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend. It wasn’t a secret that Leng Shaoting had never shown any interest in other women before, and Master Leng was also very satisfied with this future grand daughter-in-law.

Master Xu even said more than once that he wished that Gu Ning could be his future grand daughter-in-law.

...

When Gu Ning and Zi Beiying arrived outside of the Shengning Tower, Gu Ning introduced it to Zi Beiying, “Look, this building is called Shengning Tower, and it’s the headquarters of the Shengning Organization, which hasn’t been established yet, so we haven’t put the name on it either. The land behind this building is attached to it, and it’s still under construction now.”

“Wow, Gu Ning, it’s so unbelievable!” Zi Beiying was shocked.

Although this building and the land were merely nothing for the Zi family, Zi Beiying thought that it was very cool. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Gu Ning was only 19, while she was already 24. However, Gu Ning had made great achievements, while she had done nothing impressive. In addition, there couldn’t be another girl who could become a billionaire at such an early age! Gu Ning was literally a genius.

Only Gu Ning, who was as beautiful as smart, could be Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend.

Zi Beiying realized that it was quite understandable that Leng Shaoting chose Gu Ning instead of her. Compared with Gu Ning, she wasn’t outstanding at all. Because Gu Ning was far better than her, she became Gu Ning’s fan and Gu Ning was her idol now.

“Let’s go in now!” Gu Ning said, then walked into the building with Zi Beiying and the others.

Although the Shengning Organization wasn’t established yet, the place was already open for business. At the reception desk, there were three tall, pretty women.

“Hi, welcome, Miss Gu!” They were all excited the moment Gu Ning showed up.

Although they knew that Gu Ning was the founder of the Shengning Organization, they had to obey the rules and simply call her Miss Gu.

Gu Ning smiled at them, then continued to walk inside.

After Gu Ning and the others were in the elevator, the three receptionists almost yelled in excitement.

“OMG, I just saw the founder of our company! She’s so beautiful.”

“Indeed, she’s much prettier than those photos of her.”

“I feel so lucky that I can work here.”

“Me too.”

...

Gu Ning brought them straight up to the 17th floor where Chen Cangyi’s CEO’s office was; her office was on the 18th floor.

K was about to leave when Gu Ning and the others came. With Leng Shaoting’s help, the game company easily passed the legal check, and he could go get the certificate now. Once they had the certificate, they could release the game.

“Hi, boss, good news.” K beamed at Gu Ning the second he saw her. “I just received a call from the Administration for Industry and Commerce, and our game company is ready to open now!”

After K finished saying that, his sight fell on Zi Beiying. He wasn’t surprised because he already saw them in the surveillance cameras.

Nevertheless, Zi Beiying was astonished when she saw K standing up on his feet. Not only Zi Beiying, but Mengda and Nan were also shocked.

“Nice to see you, Miss Zi.” K politely greeted Zi Beiying.
