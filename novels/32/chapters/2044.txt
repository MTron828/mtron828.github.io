Chapter 2046: Share a Meal This Afternoon

In fact, they never denied Gu Ning’s abilities, but they got jealous precisely because Gu Ning was very outstanding.

Because it was a news video, it wasn’t long and there weren’t many pictures of Gu Ning standing with Tang Yunfan. Tang Yunfan didn’t show up very much in the camera either, so no one found out that Gu Ning resembled Tang Yunfan.

In addition, Gu Ning didn’t resemble Tang Yunfan that closely, so people could easily ignore it.

Even if someone noticed it, their surnames were different. One was Tang, while the other Gu. So nobody would connect them together.

The news soon spread abroad in the Capital University, and many other prestigious universities, so a lot of people saw it.

This time, Gu Ning became really famous.

For the Capital University, it was great pride and the leaders of the school were very happy about that. Because Gu Ning was a very outstanding student, the school was able to gain a good reputation too.

Nie Chenyang called Gu Ning to congratulate her. Although he knew the Shengning Organization would be established, he felt it would be more appropriate to congratulate her after the establishment.

Nie Chenyang didn’t blame Gu Ning for not inviting him, because they weren’t very close. He would be happy if he was invited, but it wasn’t suitable from Gu Ning’s position.

…

Xie Yiyi normally paid no attention to news like that, and she was resting in her dorm room in a military base.

However, one of Xie Yiyi’s female friends loved reading the news, so she read posts about the news conference of the Shengning Organization.

After that, she noticed Leng Shaoting in the video and sent Xie Yiyi the link at once: Yiyi, it’s quite strange! Why did Leng Shaoting show up in the business news? Anyway, he’s so charming in a military uniform. When can you steal his heart? What if other women saw him and stole his heart before you?

Since she was Xie Yiyi’s friend, she was aware that Xie Yiyi admired Leng Shaoting. That was the reason why she sent Xie Yiyi the news link and message.

She also knew that Leng Shaoting was always cold to every girl, but she had no idea that he already had a fiancée. So even though there was no development between Xie Yiyi’s relationship with Leng Shaoting, she still thought that Xie Yiyi had a chance.

Before Xie Yiyi played the video, she saw the cover picture of Leng Shaoting standing with Gu Ning on the screen. After reading her friend’s message, she felt very upset. Leng Shaoting already had a fiancée, so it was impossible for her to win his heart now.

In order to stop her friend from saying it again, Xie Yiyi replied: Don’t talk about Leng Shaoting with me again. He already has a fiancée. It’s the girl in a white suit in the video.

After replying to her friend, Xie Yiyi began to watch the video. Nevertheless, she was amazed when she watched and heard the content of the video.

Although she already knew that the girl chosen by the Leng family couldn’t be born in a common family, she was still surprised by Gu Ning’s unbelievable abilities.

Gu Ning was only 19 this year and she was just a freshman.

It was incredible!

The first idea that appeared in Xie Yiyi’s mind was that Gu Ning relied on her own abilities instead of dirty tricks to become so successful today.

Because she had met Gu Ning twice, she could see that Gu Ning was very different from her peers although they barely talked to each other. Moreover, she wasn’t dumb. If Gu Ning wasn’t outstanding, she couldn’t become so successful just with her connections.

She was a great example. Her family was very influential and was a major general, but she still had to rely on herself to be promoted step by step.

If connections were really omnipotent, she would have been in a very high position long ago. Therefore, she believed that Gu Ning had outstanding abilities.

Precisely because of that, she grew more jealous of Gu Ning.

Gu Ning wasn’t only beautiful, outstanding and influential, but most importantly she won Leng Shaoting’s heart.

Xie Yiyi was jealous of Gu Ning, and was unwilling to accept the reality, but she never had any ideas to hurt Gu Ning. She wasn’t evil, and had no reason to do that. After all, it was her unrequited love from the beginning to the end. However, she wouldn’t be pleased if she saw Gu Ning again.

Xie Yiyi was in a terrible mood now, so she went out to run instead of having a nap.

Xie Yiyi’s friend was shocked after reading her reply.

What? Leng Shaoting already has a fiancée? It’s the girl named Gu Ning?

Anyway, Gu Ning was indeed very outstanding and had great achievements at a very young age. In addition, she was stunningly beautiful. She and Leng Shaoting were really a perfect couple.

Xie Yiyi’s friend felt sorry for her, but didn’t blame Gu Ning for it. After all, it was their own personal affair, so she had no position to interfere.

…

“When will you go back? If you have time, why don’t we share a meal this afternoon?” asked Gu Ning.

Tang Haifeng and Tang Yunfan would leave for the airport at 4 pm, so it would be time for dinner after she sent them to the airport.

“Sure!” Both Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye agreed. They also had the idea to invite Gu Ning for a meal this afternoon.

Although Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye didn’t want to see each other, they knew that Gu Ning wouldn’t dine alone with either of them because Gu Ning was unwilling to embarrass them. As a result, even if Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye were reluctant to see each other, they could only accept the reality or Gu Ning would ignore both of them.

After staying with Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye for about an hour, Gu Ning left first because she needed to send her grandfather and father to the airport. Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye didn’t stop her.

They were reluctant to dine in another place, so they had a meal in that clubhouse. Now, they went to have a rest in their own rooms.

Chu Peihan stayed with Chu Xuanfeng.

Right after Gu Ning left the clubhouse, Situ Ye called her and said he wanted to buy some pills from Gu Ning.

He didn’t ask for the pills at their meeting just now, but did it on the phone when Gu Ning left because he couldn’t say it aloud with Qi Tianlin’s presence.

Gu Ning agreed with alacrity. She didn’t ask for as much money from Situ Ye as Qi Tianlin. She only charged him ten million yuan for twenty pills.

When Gu Ning was back at the Huangdeng Hotel, she sensed no air of cultivators around, so she called Leng Shaoting.
