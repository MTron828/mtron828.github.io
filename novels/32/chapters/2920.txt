2922 Tang Jiayang’s Girlfriend

She had heard a lot about Gu Ning’s career and admired Gu Ning very much. After all, Gu Ning built up her company at only eighteen years old and it quickly expanded to be a large business group within a year. Currently, her business group was very famous in their country. And she was also the Leng family’s granddaughter-in-law.

Gu Ning must be blessed!

“Can I directly call you Siwen, instead of Miss Ju? It sounds closer,” Gu Ning asked. Since Ju Siwen was Tang Jiayang’s girlfriend and Tang Jiayang had the intention of marrying her, she would try to form a close relationship with Ju Siwen. Otherwise Ju Siwen would feel awkward.

Before she got familiar with them, she might feel like an outsider.

!!

Hearing Gu Ning’s words, Ju Siwen was very excited. In fact, she was afraid that Gu Ning might not like her.

Although Ju Siwen was a quality girl, she still got nervous when she was first meeting her boyfriend’s family. She really cared about their opinion of her.

Everyone would want to join a new family happily.

“Well, then I won’t call you Miss Gu. I can call you Ningning. Do you mind?” Ju Siwen asked. Because Gu Ning was Tang Jiayang’s cousin, she was afraid that Gu Ning might feel offended if she directly called her name.

“Of course not!” Gu Ning said with a smile.

Because Ju Siwen had met Tang Jiakai before, there was no need for Tang Jiayang to introduce them.

After that, Tang Jiayang told Ju Siwen to sit next to Gu Ning. Honestly, Ju Siwen felt a little uneasy, but she still composed herself.

Before long, Tang Jiayang’s two friends also came.

Ju Siwen knew both of them, but Tang Jiakai and Gu Ning met them for the first time, so Tang Jiayang did the introductions.

Tang Jiayang’s two friends were born in City B, and were only back home for a short time. They hadn’t heard of Gu Ning, and only knew that she was Tang Jiakai and Tang Jiayang’s cousin.

However, because of Gu Ning’s outstanding appearance, both of them were attracted to her and talked to her as soon as they had a chance. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

At the beginning, they didn’t show their intention obviously, because it would be embarrassing. Therefore, they chatted with Tang Jiakai at the same time, which made them seem extroverted. Anyway, they were usually talkative, so nobody noticed anything wrong with them, but gradually they couldn’t hide their interest in Gu Ning, and Tang Jiayang had to repeatedly interrupt them. Tang Jiayang felt it was inappropriate to directly tell them that Gu Ning was already married, because they didn’t say anything impolite even though they seemed very interested in Gu Ning.

Therefore, if he directly said that Gu Ning was married, they would be embarrassed.

At almost 10 pm, Gu Ning’s phone rang and it was Leng Shaoting. She picked up his call right in front of the other people.

She could see that Tang Jiayng’s friends were interested in her, so she deliberately answered Leng Shaoting’s call in front of them. She would let them know that she already had a husband and that they should keep a polite distance away from her.

“Hi, honey, where are you now?” Gu Ning asked.

Upon hearing that, the two men were struck dumb.

Honey? Did she already have a husband or boyfriend?

Couples nowadays tended to call each other honey whether they were dating or married, so it could be her boyfriend or husband.

“I’ve just gotten off of the plane,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Jiayang and I are in XX club. Why don’t you come over? We’re in Room XX,” Gu Ning invited.

“Sure,” Leng Shaoting said.

After hanging up, Tang Jiayang joked on purpose. “Your husband misses you so much that he came to City B to see you as soon as he’s free.”

“Right, oh, how’s your wedding preparations now?” Tang Jiakai asked.

“My mother-in-law is preparing it. It’s almost done. We only need to wait till the chosen date,” Gu Ning said.

“What? Didn’t Miss Gu just graduate? She’s already married?” one of the men asked in surprise.

“Yeah, I fell in love with my husband when I’m a senior in high school. We got engaged then, but we couldn’t become a legal couple till I reached the age of consent.” Gu Ning answered.

The two men were immediately disappointed, but they didn’t show it.

After knowing that Gu Ning already had a husband, they stopped chatting with her, but they remained polite. They didn’t become rude towards Gu Ning just because they didn’t have a chance with her.

About fifty minutes later, Leng Shaoting arrived.

The moment the two men saw Leng Shaoting, they accepted their failure. Gu Ning’s husband was a lot more handsome than them and he had an air of authority.

“Aren’t you afraid Grandpa Leng and your mother will be unhappy that you came to City B to see me as soon as you had time?” Gu Ning asked Leng Shaoting.

“You’re my wife. Why should they be unhappy? I think they’ll be very satisfied if they know that I care about you so much. Without you, I would die alone, but luckily I fell in love because of you,” Leng Shaoting replied. He didn’t feel embarrassed at all to say sweet things in front of other people.

At about 12 am, they separated. Gu Ning and Leng Shaojia went back to Huafu Hills, while Tang Jiayang and Tang Jiakai drove Ju Siwen home before they went home.

Tang Jiayang’s two friends went home on their own.

After Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting walked away, they didn’t rush to take a taxi home. Instead, they decided to take a walk, then Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting why she suddenly came to City B.

As they walked, a car drove by them, but they smelt fresh blood from it and there was evil energy permeating from it too.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting exchanged a glance, then immediately chased after it.

At the same time, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see what was in the car. Surprisingly, she saw several vampires, and one of them was sucking a girl’s blood.

Without delay, Gu Ning summoned her magical energy and hit the tire of the car.

“Boom!” A tire was hit by magical energy and exploded.

Once the tire exploded, the car had to stop and two men got out of it to see what happened.

When they saw that the tire exploded, they immediately went to take out a spare tire.

Right at that moment, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to the car and pretended to be helpful.

“Can I help?” Gu Ning asked.

“No need.” The man replied coldly.
