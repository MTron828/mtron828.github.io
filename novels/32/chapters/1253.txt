Chapter 1254: Guo Yiyang Is Saved

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Yiyang? Yiyang!” Sun Chao was excited when Guo Yiyang gradually opened his eyes. Gu Ning also moved her hand away and stopped putting her magical power into his body. Although Gu Ning had adequate magical power, it cost her a lot of energy to save Guo Yiyang and her face turned a little pale.

After a short while, Guo Yiyang was finally able to talk. “M-Miss Gu?”

“Yiyang, you’re finally awake!” Sun Chao almost burst into tears in excitement.

“What’s going on here?” Guo Yiyang couldn’t remember what had happened to him.

“Did you forget everything? We just went into the cave and you were bitten by a large python,” Sun Chao said.

“Oh, right.” Guo Yiyang remembered it and felt scared.

“We hid ourselves in the cave for nearly two hours and you were about to die when Miss Gu found us. She saved your life!” Sun Chao continued.

If it hadn’t been for Gu Ning, Guo Yiyang would have been killed.

They subconsciously took Gu Ning as a straw to clutch at. Only Gu Ning could save them right now.

Luckily, Gu Ning really came and she was willing to help them.

Guo Yiyang also struggled to stay alive till the moment Gu Ning arrived.

Both Guo Yiyang and Sun Chao felt very lucky that they were able to be Gu Ning’s friends.

“Miss Gu, thank you so much. I don’t know what to say now...” Guo Yiyang said and felt touched.

After that, he put on a serious face. “Miss Gu, you’ve saved my life twice, and I owe you a lot. Whatever you need me to do for you in the future, I won’t spare any effort to help you.”

Gu Ning had saved his life twice, and he couldn’t feel more grateful to her. If it hadn’t been for Gu Ning, he could have been killed by the zombie in the ancient grave last time. And Gu Ning saved his life again from the python this time.

Even though he knew that Gu Ning wouldn’t ask him to die for her, he was still willing to do that if she really wanted him to do that.

“Sure.” Gu Ning nodded.

In fact, they had never forgotten her whenever they found valuable antiques, although they did that because they needed her protection.

A real selfish person wouldn’t share his fortune with other people even if he had to risk his life. They, on the contrary, were willing to let Gu Ning take most of the valuable objects. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Gu Ning had no intention to test their loyalty to her, because it wouldn’t do her any good. She thought that they now had pure trust in each other, and she wanted to help them live a better life.

They couldn’t be grave-diggers forever, because it was very dangerous and illegal. Once they were caught by the police, they would have to spend the rest of their life in jail.

Moreover, they already had a lot of money now, and Gu Ning hoped that they could stop doing it. If they were willing to work for her, it would be better.

Gu Ning didn’t believe that they were useless except for grave-digging. They were smart and could learn how to do business.

Gu Ning didn’t lack skilled people, but she did lack people she could trust.

“Stand up now. Let’s see whether you can walk,” Gu Ning said.

Guo Yiyang listened to her and stood up. He only felt a little uncomfortable because his pants were wet, but the wound wasn’t painful at all.

“I feel full of energy again!” Guo Yiyang was surprised. He knew that Gu Ning’s medicine was super effective, but he was still amazed by its effect.

Actually, Gu Ning’s magical power was more effective than the magical pill.

“Really?” Sun Chao was also astonished. He couldn’t believe his ears.

“I mean it!” Guo Yiyang said with a broad smile.

“Jesus, it’s so unbelievable!” Sun Chao exclaimed.

“Alright, since we’re all fine now, we should go out right away. Uncle Li is still waiting for us,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Guo Yiyang and Sun Chao looked guilty. “Right, he must be very worried about us.”

After that, they went back together.

“Oh, Miss Gu, how’s the python now?” Sun Chao suddenly asked.

“It’s already been killed,” Gu Ning replied.

Guo Yiyang and Sun Chao nodded. Since Gu Ning was able to get rid of a zombie, it couldn’t be difficult for her to deal with a python.

There was no signal in the cave, so they couldn’t call Li Maosong and Zhao Jiangquan right now. So in order to not worry Li Maosong, they walked fast.

“You can go ahead of me, I need to block the pond in case another dangerous creature comes out of it,” Gu Ning said to Guo Yiyang and Sun Chao.

She needed to put the jiao back into the telepathic eye space, and she didn’t want them to see the jiao.

“Sure.” Guo Yiyang and Sun Chao listened to Gu Ning without asking anything.
