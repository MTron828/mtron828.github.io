“Alright, I know what to do. Thank you, Shaoting.” Leng Shaoming thanked him seriously.

“No problem.” Leng Shaoting answered.

Afterwards, they hung up.

Right after Zhan Zhiyin left the hospital, she went to book a room in a hotel. She was lost in thought as she stayed inside by herself.

She told Leng Shaoming that she wasn’t eager to have his reply, and she knew he needed time to accept it, but she couldn’t take her eyes off the screen of her phone. She hoped that he would call her right now.

At the same time, she wasn’t prepared for that.

If Leng Shaoming could accept her, she hoped that he could call her as soon as possible, but what if he couldn’t?

She didn’t want that to happen, but she had to accept the result if he rejected her.

Nevertheless, she hadn’t received anything from Leng Shaoming yet. Was he scared of her? Or was he still hesitating?

If he was still hesitating to make a decision, did it mean that she still had a chance?

Zhan Zhiyin felt it wasn’t very likely.

…

After hanging up the call with Leng Shaoting, Leng Shaoming didn’t contact Zhan Zhiyin at once, because he needed time to digest and accept it.

If he contacted Zhan Zhiyin before he was sure that he could accept her, it would be irresponsible and would hurt her.

…

Leng Shaoting called Gu Ning after having the call with Leng Shaoming.

He told Gu Ning that Leng Shaoming just called him.

Zhan Zhiyin had sent Gu Ning a message earlier in the afternoon so Gu Ning wasn’t surprised.

“Do you think Leng Shaoming can accept her?” asked Gu Ning.

“Perhaps he will,” said Leng Shaoting. That was his idea, but he wasn’t sure what Leng Shaoming would do.

“If they are really in love with each other, I hope they will end up together, but if Leng Shaoming can’t accept it, we can’t do anything about it. After all, it’s really hard for ordinary people to accept,” said Gu Ning.

“It’s their affair. We should mind our own business. Do you miss me?” asked Leng Shaoting.

“Yeah, every moment!” said Gu Ning. Although it sounded like a perfunctory answer, that was her real feelings.

“How much do you miss me?” asked Leng Shaoting again.

“To an extreme extent!” said Gu Ning.

“Oh, did Leng Shaoming tell you that he and Zhan Zhiyin encountered a car accident today?” asked Gu Ning.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting frowned and said, “No, he didn’t tell me about it. What happened?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Even though he had a very shallow relationship with Leng Shaoming, they were family after all, so he cared about Leng Shaoming’s safety.

After that, Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting about the car accident which Leng Shaoming and Zhan Zhiyin had encountered today.

“Have they found the mastermind?” asked Leng Shaoting.

“No idea, I didn’t ask further,” said Gu Ning.

…

In the meanwhile, Leng Shaoming thought about it for an hour more, then made up his mind. Three hours had passed so it was already 10 pm.

After that, Leng Shaoming called Zhan Zhiyin.

The moment her phone rang, Zhan Zhiyin was slightly scared. When she saw Leng Shaoming’s name, she was excited and yet panicked because she didn’t know whether it was good or bad news.

Therefore, Zhan Zhiyin didn’t answer it right away. After hesitating for a few seconds, she finally picked it up, but she said nothing.

“Zhiyin.” Leng Shaoming called her.

“Yeah,” said Zhan Zhiyin.

“I read your message. And I have to say I was shocked and terrified when I read it. I couldn’t accept it right away, because it’s totally beyond my imagination. I spent the last few hours pondering over it. Although I haven’t completely digested it yet, I’m very sure that I love you. I want to be together with you. If you don’t mind that I’m not really ready, can you give me a chance?” said Leng Shaoming. He didn’t hide his real thoughts, because it wouldn’t be realistic if he didn’t panic at all.

Zhan Zhiyin cried in excitement, but didn’t cry aloud.

It was honestly a surprising answer from him.

She understood that Leng Shaoming wasn’t well-prepared yet. Even if he was still scared of her, she was willing to wait till he gave her an answer as long as he didn’t cut off their relationship.

“A-Are you serious?” asked Zhan Zhiyin. She believed Leng Shaoming, but it was very important, so she needed to make sure.

“Yeah, but do you mind that I still need more time…” asked Leng Shaoming. Although it was understandable that he couldn’t completely digest it yet, he called Zhan Zhiyin back right away. He said that he loved her and wanted to be together with her, but he was afraid that she might think he was irresponsible.

“I don’t mind it at all. Actually, your opinions matter more.” Zhan Zhiyin interrupted him at once. She now needed his acceptance more than he needed hers. She didn’t mind that he needed more time.

“Where are you now?” asked Leng Shaoming.

“I’m in the hotel,” said Zhan Zhiyin.

“What hotel is it? I can go pick you up,” said Leng Shaoming. He didn’t ask Zhan Zhiyin to come back on her own. Instead, he would go to pick her up.

“No need, I’ll go back by myself.” Zhan Zhiyin declined.

“Great, come back now!” Leng Shaoming didn’t insist. He was considerate, but they were in an embarrassing situation now. Zhan Zhiyin might need more time to calm herself down.

It was not only Zhan Zhiyin, he also needed more time to calm down. He didn’t want to lose his manners when they met again.

“Sure,” said Zhan Zhiyin.

Leng Shaoming urged Zhan Zhiyin to come back quickly, but Zhan Zhiyin still didn’t know how to face him. Even though Leng Shaoming accepted her, she still felt very nervous.

Therefore, Zhan Zhiyin spent an hour getting to the hospital. Normally, it should only take her half an hour.
