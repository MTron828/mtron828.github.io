Chapter 2715: Time to Get Married

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

They badly needed money at this moment, but they wouldn’t force their other family members to help them with it. However, if they wanted to take advantage of them when they were helpless, they wouldn’t grin and bear it!

Although Gu Ning had no interest in their family affair, she also felt that Senior Mrs. Liang and Junior Mrs. Liang’s behavior was unacceptable. It seemed that there were shameless relatives in every family.

Senior Mrs. Liang and Junior Mrs. Liang were unwilling to give up. They exchanged a glance and reached a tacit agreement.

Afterward, Senior Mrs. Liang said, “Well, we don’t have much money in our pockets. However, we won’t force you to sell it to us at a low price. We didn’t mean to take advantage of you. We just wanted to help in case you couldn’t sell it. But our mother-in-law is senior to all of us. It’s our filial duty to please our mother-in-law, right? Yunchan, you shouldn’t be mean to our mother-in-law.”

“I agree. Although all the jewelry is damaged, I think our mother-in-law won’t mind,” said Junior Mrs. Liang.

Hearing their words, Old Mrs. Liang became happy. She definitely wouldn’t mind, but it should be free.

Although the Liang family was wealthy and Old Mrs. Liang never lacked jewelry, she was used to taking advantage of other people. Whenever there was a chance, she wouldn’t hesitate to exploit the others. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Of course, as a daughter-in-law, I ought to please mother-in-law, but we’re in a mess right now. And we need money. I don’t expect mother-in-law to help us out, but please don’t cause more trouble for us,” said Jing Yunchan. Once she finished speaking, she turned to look at Old Mrs. Liang. “Am I right, mother-in-law?”

Jing Yunchan was smarter than Senior Mrs. Liang and Junior Mrs. Liang. She was a little impulsive and arrogant because she was born in a powerful family, but once she calmed down and thought about it carefully, she could come up with smart ideas.

Although Old Mrs. Liang loved to take advantage of other people, she cared about her reputation too. Therefore, after she heard Jing Yunchan’s words, she was displeased and snapped at Senior Mrs. Liang and Junior Mrs. Liang. “Why did you two bring me into it all of a sudden? Do I need more jewelry? I don’t want other people to think I would force Yunchan to give me a gift.”

Senior Mrs. Liang and Junior Mrs. Liang didn’t dare to say anything further after Old Mrs. Liang snapped at them. They had lived with Old Mrs. Liang for dozens of years so they clearly understood what kind of person she was. However, they couldn’t say it aloud.

…

Gu Ning had already written the agreement and Liang Hongfeng only needed to read it and sign his name. It didn’t take much time so they were soon finished.

......

Afterwards, Gu Ning left.

It was time for dinner, so Jing Jining invited Gu Ning to have a meal with them. Gu Ning wasn’t in a rush to go home, so she accepted his invitation.

Gu Ning was a distinguished guest for the Jing family, so they were very respectful of her.

The housekeeper ran over at once when Jing Jining got home. “Patriarch, Miss Shen has come. She’s talking with master and ma’am in the living room at the moment.” The housekeeper passed on a piece of bad news.

Upon hearing the name Miss Shen, Jing Jining was upset, but he didn’t hate her. He only had mixed emotions.

Gu Ning gave Jing Jining a glance, but didn’t ask about it, because it was his personal affairs.

Anyway, Gu Ning guessed that Miss Shen might admire Jing Jining, but she wasn’t sure of Jing Jining’s attitude.

As for Jing Jining’s romantic relationship, because of what had happened to Jing Yunyao that year, he stayed outside of the cultivation world all the time and never got married.

Now Jing Jining was getting older and had become the Jing family’s new patriarch, so Gu Ning thought it was time for him to get married and raise a family.

However, it was Jing Jining’s personal affair, so Gu Ning wouldn’t interfere.

Jing Jining didn’t bother to avoid Miss Shen, but directly took Gu Ning to the living hall. Since Jing Yanhua and Junior Mrs. Jing were also present, Gu Ning believed that she could stay.

If it was really inconvenient, Jing Jining would have told her to keep a distance.

…

In the living room.

Jing Yanhua and his wife were chatting with a young beautiful woman. There was a smile on their faces, and the atmosphere was quite pleasant.

When Jing Jining and Gu Ning walked in, the young beautiful woman immediately stood up. She turned to look at Jing Jining and greeted him. “Hi, Jining, nice to see you again.”

This woman was Miss Shen and there was obvious affection in her eyes for Jing Jining.

“Hi!” Jing Jining replied in a flat voice.

The next moment, Miss Shen smiled at Gu Ning and asked gently, “This must be Miss Gu, right?”

Although this was their first meeting, she had heard a lot about Gu Ning in the cultivation world. Therefore, she guessed correctly once she saw Gu Ning.

Since the girl was Gu Ning, Miss Chen didn’t get jealous when Gu Ning walked in with Jing Jining.

“I am Gu Ning. Nice to meet you,” said Gu Ning. Gu Ning had met Miss Shen before at Tiandaozong, but she hadn’t heard her name back then.

“Nice to meet you, Miss Gu. I’m Shen Yiling.” Shen Yiling introduced herself.

“Come here and have a seat. Don’t just stand there,” said Junior Mrs. Jing.

Hearing that, everyone walked over. Gu Ning also exchanged greetings with Jing Yanhua and Junior Mrs. Jing.

“How is it?” Junior Mrs. Jing asked with concern. She had heard about what had happened between Gu Ning and Jing Yuelan. She was angry at Jing Yuelan’s behavior.

Gu Ning visited the Jing family with Jing Yunyao, but she did nothing. She was innocent!

“It’s done now. Jing Yuelan’s father agreed to compensate me, but they can’t give me that much money right now. They need a month,” said Gu Ning.

“That’s great!” Hearing that, Junior Mrs. Jing was relieved. Although she knew they ought to pay the compensation, she was afraid it might not be solved smoothly. After all, it was a lot of money! And Jing Yunchan wouldn’t easily accept the result.

Anyway, since Liang Hongfeng agreed to pay the compensation, there shouldn’t be a problem.

“Does Yunyao know?” Jing Yanhua asked with worries.

Because Gu Ning got involved in this trouble because of Jing Yunyao, he was afraid it might cause a grudge between Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao.
