Chapter 2793: Are You Afraid of Me Curing Him?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning was very angry, but she curbed her anger. Leng Yuanqian also controlled himself and asked, “What if the Leng family doesn’t agree?”

“We’re not asking for your permission,” said Kirk Thomas arrogantly.

Hearing that, Gu Ning and Leng Yuanqian became even angrier. They were disdaining the Leng family! Given the Leng family’s status, the Thomas family wasn’t comparable to them. Why were they so confident?

Did they think the Leng family should do whatever they asked just because Leng Shaojia made a mistake?

At this moment, Gu Ning opened her mouth and said coldly, “Do you think your son or Leng Shaoting is more important?”

“Of course my son is more important,” said Kirk Thomas. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“If I can cure your son, will you give up on Leng Shaoting?” asked Gu Ning. Actually, whether she could cure his son or not, she wouldn’t allow them to steal Leng Shaoting away from her.

“Really? Can you cure my son? Are you kidding?” Kirk Thomas laughed at Gu Ning. He refused to believe it because his son wasn’t only injured in the head, he was also injured in other parts. Otherwise, his son wouldn’t be unconscious for so long.

In fact, it wasn’t just caused by Leng Shaojia. His son was already in a bad condition, they just used it to scheme against the Leng family.

“What if I can? Mr. Thomas, please answer me sincerely. If I can cure your son, will you stay away from Leng Shaoting and deal with it according to the law,” asked Gu Ning seriously.

“Of course.” Kirk Thomas answered, but he still didn’t take Gu Ning’s words seriously. He thought Gu Ning was joking.

“Mr. Thomas, can you give me a chance?” asked Gu Ning.

Hearing that, Kirk Thomas said with displeasure, “Miss, what do you think this place is? Do you know what you’ll pay for such a joke?”

“I’m not joking,” said Gu Ning with a serious expression.

“You’re not joking? Do you seriously think you can cure my son?” said Kirk Thomas disdainfully.

“What if I can?” asked Gu Ning.

“Do you think I’d believe you?” said Kirk Thomas mockingly.

“Why don’t you let me try?” said Gu Ning.

“Try it? Do you think you can do whatever you want here? What if any accidents happen?” said Kirk Thomas. Because he didn’t trust Gu Ning, he wouldn’t let her do it.

“If you don’t let me do it, how could you know an accident will happen? Oh, I see, Mr. Thomas, are you afraid that I’ll really cure your son?” Gu Ning said meaningfully.

Gu Ning didn’t really mean it, she was just prodding Kirk Thomas into action.

“Damn it, how dare you say that?” Hearing that, Kirk Thomas angrily criticized her.

“I told you I can cure your son, but you won’t give me a chance to try it. Are you afraid your son will really be cured? No matter what happens afterwards, I’m right here in your place. You can do whatever you want to me,” said Gu Ning.

“You…” Kirk Thomas was mad, but Gu Ning’s words made sense. Although he didn’t think she could cure his son, it wasn’t a big deal if she had a try.

However, there was one condition. “Great, you can have a try, but if you can’t cure my son, Leng Shaoting must marry into my family. And you’ll be our slave. How is it?”

“No problem,” said Gu Ning with alacrity, but she was very displeased, because Kirk Thomas was humiliating her.

However, in order to solve the problem, she tolerated it. Anyway, she would pay him back.

“Ningning…” Leng Yuanqian believed that Gu Ning was mature and stable. Since she said that, she must have confidence, but he was still worried.

“It’s fine,” said Gu Ning to comfort him.

Leng Yuanqian felt much relieved.

“Other people stay here. You, follow me,” said Kirk Thomas.

“Fine.” Gu Ning nodded. It was exactly what she wanted. She also wanted to go with him alone, leaving the other people in the hall.

After all, Leng Shaojia was upstairs. If they were all gone, she would be worried about Leng Shaojia’s safety.

Leng Yuanqian opened his mouth wanting to say something, but Gu Ning gave him a glance to comfort him, so he said nothing.

Afterwards, Kirk Thomas told everyone to come in. When Gu Ning was close to Si Jin, she said in a low voice, “Leng Shaojia is in the third room on the third floor. Don’t go over right now, but if anything happens, go rescue her then.”

Hearing that, Si Jin was slightly surprised. She didn’t expect Leng Shaojia to be upstairs.

“Sure,” said Si Jin.

Afterwards, Gu Ning left with Kirk Thomas and his people. In fact, only Kirk Thomas and his son, Kyle Thomas, walked away, the other people stayed to watch Leng Yuanqian and the others.

Although it was unpleasant, they had to accept it. They could only hope that Gu Ning could solve the problem smoothly, but only Si Jin and Leng Yuanqian believed that Gu Ning could cure Kane Thomas. The others didn’t think she could do that.

However, the Thomas family’s members were here, so they couldn’t talk loudly.

Gu Ning followed Kirk Thomas to the main house. Although other people were curious about it, no one asked them any questions.

Kirk Thomas directly took Gu Ning to Kane Thomas’s room.

The Thomas family’s house was decorated luxuriously and it was obviously extremely expensive, which proved that the Thomas family had a lot of vanity.

They were wealthy and never hesitated to show it off.

Although Kane Thomas was injured and unconscious, the Thomas family had its own team of family doctors. All of them were at the senior expert level, so there was no need to go to the hospital.

Kirk Thomas’ wife was in the room. When his wife saw Kirk Thomas bringing Gu Ning in, she asked confusedly, “Kirk, who is she? What did you bring her here for?”
