Chapter 1846: She’s Scheming Something

Since Gu Ning was happy, Leng Shaoting was happy too and laughed as well.

His smile fascinated Gu Ning.

As soon as they returned to the villa, Leng Shaoting moved closer to her. They were going to have a sleepless night tonight.

Although Gu Ning still had military training the next day, Leng Shaoting now knew that she could use magical power to restore her mental and physical strength. Even if Gu Ning couldn’t do that, he was now a cultivator and he could help her regain her energy again. Therefore, they had passionate sex for a whole night.

They didn’t stop or sleep until 4 am. They only slept for two hours and got up at 6 am.

“Use magical power to get your strength back, otherwise, you’ll feel uncomfortable,” Leng Shaoting said with concern.

“What? Are you worried about my body?” Gu Ning asked with a smile.

“Yeah,” Leng Shaoting replied. He cared about her.

Suddenly, Gu Ning gave Leng Shaoting a glare. “Since you’re worried about my body, why didn’t you control yourself just now?”

“I couldn’t stay calm when my beloved girl was in my arms. I’m a man!” Leng Shaoting said, taking it for granted. Even if he loved Gu Ning, he couldn’t give up having sex with her.

“Ha-ha,” Gu Ning snorted with laughter, because she thought of a popular joke on the Internet.

A woman and a man slept on the same bed one night, but the woman put a pillow in the middle. She told the man that he couldn’t cross the boundary. If he did, he wasn’t a gentleman. Therefore, the man did not cross the boundary all night. However, when they got up the next morning, the woman slapped the man and said that he wasn’t a man at all.

Gu Ning’s smile made Leng Shaoting feel aroused. Without delay, he pressed against her again. Gu Ning struggled, glaring at him. “Get up! I need to go to school.”

Leng Shaoting thought for a while. It was indeed time for them to get up now, so he reluctantly got up from Gu Ning’s body.

After quickly cleaning up, Leng Shaoting sent Gu Ning to school.

Because they didn’t have much time, they didn’t make breakfast at home. Instead, when they saw a breakfast shop on the way, Leng Shaoting went to buy Gu Ning a glass of milk and bread.

He wasn’t in a rush to eat, so he took care of Gu Ning first.

Although Gu Ning was absent, Song Miaoge didn’t forget to train. After all, Baili Zongxue was still with her. Baili Zongxue was also excellent at fighting.

When Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao got up, there were only two of them in the dorm room, so they talked about Gu Ning being absent all night.

It actually couldn’t mean anything, but they hated Gu Ning, so they criticized her behind her back.

“Shiyan, when will your older brother help you punish her!” Lu Xiaoxiao asked. It had been so long, but they heard no news about it.

Although she didn’t hate Gu Ning as much as Gao Shiyan, she also disliked Gu Ning. She was jealous of Gu Ning’s outstanding appearance, and hoped that she could be punished.

“My older brother went on a trip with friends a few days ago, but he came back yesterday. He promised to cause Gu Ning trouble in school today,” Gao Shiyan said with hatred, wishing to see Gu Ning severely punished. Only in that way could her hatred be dispelled.

She had tolerated it for days, which was enough in her eyes.

Hearing that, Lu Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but smile proudly. Although Gu Ning was good at fighting, she was only better than Gao Shiyan who was a weak girl.

She didn’t think that Gu Ning could beat a man.

Leng Shaoting brought Jing Yunyao and Shangguan Yang back to the Leng family’s old house in the morning. He was going to introduce Shangguan Yang to Master Leng, because he also hoped that they could get together when they were free.

However, he couldn’t tell his grandfather that Shangguan Yang, Jing Yunyao, and himself were cultivators for the time being.

Before Leng Shaoting and the others went over, Leng Shaoting asked Master Leng to wait for them at home in case Master Leng left to see his old friends.

Because Jing Yunyao never visited the Leng family’s old house when Leng Shaoting was absent, Master Leng was actually a little dissatisfied. It was obvious that Jing Yunyao didn’t treat the Leng family as her family. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Master Leng could understand it. After all, Jing Yunyao hadn’t regained her memories yet, but he still hoped that she could come more often when she had time.

Leng Shaoting told Master Leng that Jing Yunyao returned to the place where she used to live this week. Therefore, Master Leng didn’t think much about it.

When Leng Shaoting and the others arrived at the Leng family’s old house, it was about 10 am. At this time, only Master Leng was home because the other members had gone to work.

Normally, Master Leng had lunch alone at home. He didn’t have much appetite when he ate alone, so he ate very little during lunch. He could eat more when his family was home for dinner.

Leng Shaoting and the others came this time, so Master Leng told the cook to cook more food for them. Leng Shaoting had also reminded him that his master was a big eater. His master alone was able to eat as much as four people.

Although Master Leng was very surprised by that, they didn’t lack food, so Master Leng directly told the cook to prepare a meal with all kinds of meat for eight people.

As soon as Jing Yunyao came, she called Master Leng father. It didn’t sound embarrassing, and was full of affection. Master Leng thought that Jing Yunyao might have regained her memories.

Thinking of that, he asked her.

Jing Yunyao gave him an affirmative answer.

Master Leng was ecstatic to hear that. Even though Jing Yunyao’s identity had long been affirmed, she hadn’t regained her memories. As a result, they were still strange to each other. Luckily, Jing Yunyao had finally regained her memories, which meant they were really a family now.

Master Leng was so happy that he almost cried.

Master Leng and Shangguan Yang hit it off with each other at first sight, and they quickly became familiar with each other. They both liked Elephant chess, antiques, calligraphy and paintings, while Shangguan Yang himself already had a lot of antiques, calligraphy and paintings.

Before they came, Shangguan Yang had asked Leng Shaoting about Master Leng’s likes.

Knowing that Master Leng liked calligraphy and paintings, he prepared an extremely valuable painting for him, which made Master Leng smile from ear to ear with joy.

...

At noon, Gu Ning and her friends went to the canteen after their military training and met Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao.

When Gao Shiyan saw Gu Ning, she gave her a meaningful look, then left.

“She must be scheming something,” Baili Zongxue said with a smile while looking at Gao Shiyan’s back.

Even though she knew there was a scheme, she wouldn’t be bothered because Gao Shiyan was only an ordinary girl.

She knew that Gu Ning had a conflict with Gao Shiyan. Gao Shiyan had suffered a big loss because of Gu Ning, so Gao Shiyan wouldn’t give up on getting revenge on Gu Ning.
