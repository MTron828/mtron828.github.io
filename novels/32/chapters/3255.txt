Qin Wentao? Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qin Wentao was highly likely to do that in her opinion.

Leng Xiaoyao moved away from them and called Ling Tianqi.

However, no one answered her call, perhaps because it was too noisy in the bar and no one heard it!

In that case, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t call Ling Tianqi again. He should reply to her once he saw her calls.

It was true that the music was too loud in the bar, so Ling Tianqi and the others didn’t hear the calls.

Before Ling Tianqi and the others left, Chu Jianan showed up. He was alone.

Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao directly went forward to beat him.

Because she was dressed in all black with a baseball cap and a mask, no one knew who she was.

Leng Xiaoyao understood that Chu Jianan would be suspicious of her even if he couldn’t recognize her, but she didn’t care.

Even if he was suspicious of her, he should first have evidence to sue her!

Chu Jianan had drunk a bit and was slightly tipsy, so he could barely see the person who rushed out to beat him. He only felt the pain all over his body and screamed.

Onlookers were all shocked. Although they couldn’t see Leng Xiaoyao’s face, they could tell that it was a girl.

They had never seen such a strong girl before!

They wondered why she was beating the man and thought that they must be a couple and that the man must have betrayed the girl. As a result, the girl got mad and beat him up.

Thinking that, no one felt sympathy for Chu Jianan and nobody stopped Leng Xiaoyao from beating him.

Besides, Leng Xiaoyao seemed aggressive and skilled. None of the onlookers wanted to get injured.

Leng Xiaoyao chose the most vulnerable spots to hit Chu Jianan, but left no wounds on his skin. She deliberately did that, so that Chu Jianan couldn’t get any useful evidence even if he went to have a medical check up. Unfortunately, the pain would torture him for a long time. He wasn’t just physically hurt, it was also mental injuries.

Leng Xiaoyao stopped half a minute later, then walked away.

However, she didn’t go far because she wasn’t done with the matter concerning Ling Tianqi yet. If she didn’t know, she wouldn’t have bothered to get involved, but she had to do something since she heard about it and was there.

Chu Jianan almost passed out from the pain, but he was still conscious and had to bear with it.

He didn’t see who beat him, so he had no way to get back at the person.

Before long, security guards from the bar heard that he had been attacked. They called an ambulance for Chu Jianan at once, sending him to the hospital.

Ling Tianqi was still not there even a long time later, but Leng Xiaoyao stayed patient. She played on her phone while she waited outside.

Although she could directly catch those men, they hadn’t done anything yet. If she went to beat them, it might just cause trouble.

The best solution was for Ling Tianqi and the others to come out. When those men tried to attack them, she would stand out. By then, she would have a reason to beat them. Even if it caused a scene, she would still be fine.

A few minutes later, her phone rang and Ling Tianqi called her.

“Xiaoyao, is anything up so late?” asked Ling Tianqi. He obviously sounded a little drunk.

“Are you in XX bar?” asked Leng Xiaoyao to make sure first.

“How do you know that? Are you in the bar too?” Ling Tianqi was struck dumb for a moment and exclaimed in surprise.

“Yeah, but I’m outside. I saw six strange men and observed them for a while. I heard their conversation. They plan to hurt you,” said Leng Xiaoyao.

“What?” Ling Tianqi was mad. “Is it Qin Wentao?”

Ling Tianqi thought of Qin Wentao as well because he had the most conflict against Qin Wentao.

It was just a guess, and it was possible to be other people. After all, he had conflicts against more people than just Qin Wentao.

“The first person I thought of is also him, but I’m not sure of it,” said Leng Xiaoyao. They couldn’t jump to conclusions before they had evidence.

However, she didn’t bring a laptop with her, so she couldn’t do an investigation.

“I can’t catch them right away because they haven’t done anything yet. So, after you come out, they might take action. By then, I can stand out for you,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“No problem, I’ll go out right now.” This being the case, he wasn’t in the mood to continue to have fun. Anyway, even if there was no trouble, he would still want to go outside to meet Leng Xiaoyao.

He had no other purposes. He simply took Leng Xiaoyao as his idol.

After speaking with Leng Xiaoyao, Ling Tianqi returned to his seat and told Feng Rui and Pei Heran about what happened. Afterwards, they left.

Once Feng Rui and Pei Heran heard about it, they thought of Qin Wentao as well. Whether or not it was Qin Wentao, they needed to ask those men to find out.

As soon as they walked out, the six men in the car focused on them. They didn’t take action right away, but waited to see where Ling Tianqi was going.

Because Ling Tianqi was aware that some people were waiting for them outside, he and his friends stayed alert even though Leng Xiaoyao was also outside and they would be fine.

When they got outside, they walked to the parking lot because Leng Xiaoyao told them that she and those men were there.

If they wanted to catch those men, they had to give those men a chance to take action first.

The six men saw that Ling Tianqi and his friends walked towards the parking lot. It was exactly what they wanted, so they prepared to take action.

They wanted to be quick, so they all had an iron stick in their hands.

When Ling Tianqi and his friends got close, the six men got out of the car at once. As soon as possible, they surrounded Ling Tianqi and his friends.

“Damn, they have iron sticks!”

Seeing that scene, Ling Tianqi and his friends were scared, especially since Leng Xiaoyao was still absent. They were quite panicked.

Anyway, they trusted Leng Xiaoyao, so they didn’t run away.

Even if they wanted to run, it was impossible. All six men were skilled and quick, while Ling Tianqi and his friends had all drunk a little. They had no strength to run away.

Right as the six men raised their iron sticks to beat them, several stones suddenly flew through the air but none of them noticed them.

The next moment, the stones accurately hit the six men’s hands. They felt a sharp pain and involuntarily dropped the sticks. The iron sticks fell to the ground at once. No one knew what was happening until that moment.

They had been ambushed!

Afterwards, a person showed up like lightning and attacked the six men.

The six men were indeed skilled, so they immediately came back to their senses and fought back.

Unfortunately, they were no match for the person.
