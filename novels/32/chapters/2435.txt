Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

Afterwards, Gu Ning told Zhang Zikai about the punishment the taxi driver received in the end. Although Zhang Zikai hated the taxi driver, the taxi driver didn’t succeed in hurting her, so she accepted the result.

After finding out the result at the Public Security Bureau, Gu Ning went to the antique street. She should provide more antiques for Xiangyun Antique-store now, because it was running out of commodities.

For safety, Gu Ning couldn’t leave too many antiques there.

Once she arrived at the antique street, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see whether there were real antiques.

She hadn’t visited the antique street for a long time, and she had good luck this time.

Most of the shop owners and staffers were familiar with Gu Ning, but the stands at the sides of the road weren’t, so Gu Ning went straight to buy antiques if she saw any real ones.

Although they weren’t very valuable, it was a cost-effective way to collect real antiques. Therefore, Gu Ning didn’t bother to bargain over the prices. She would make a lot of money from them anyway.

After Gu Ning left with a real antique, a stand owner who recognized her said quietly, “Oh, what should I say? Is it a good thing or a bad thing for you? There was a real antique on your stand, but you didn’t know. You just sold it. If you knew it’s real, you could make a fortune from it.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What did you say? Do you mean the one I just sold is real?” The other stand owner rounded his eyes in shock and couldn’t believe his ears.

Although they did antique business, they normally sold fake ones. If he knew there was a real one on his stand, he surely wouldn’t sell it.

“Yes!” Stand Owner A replied.

“Why didn’t you tell me? Jesus, it’s real? How much is it worth?” Stand Owner B was heavily hit.

“I didn’t know it. If Ihad known it, I would have bought it earlier. The girl picked it up, so I realized it must be real. Even if I knew it’s real, I didn’t dare to tell you. Do you know who she is? She’s the boss of Xiangyun Antique-store. She’s much more influential than you can imagine. I don’t dare to mess

with her,” said Stand Owner A.

Hearing that, Stand Owner B was stunned. In despair, he sank to the ground.

The girl was an important figure, so he didn’t dare to ask her to return the antique to him.

People around them also felt sorry for Stand Owner B.

‘What he just sold was a piece of bronzeware. If it was real, it could be worth at least hundreds of thousands of yuan, but he sold it for just several thousand yuan.

He originally thought he asked for a high price, and even felt happy for making a lot of money from the deal. Unfortunately, it turned out that he was the dumb one and the girl made a fortune instead.

Because of the unprofitable deal, he was too sad to manage his stand today and directly went home.

After Gu Ning sent the antiques to Xiangyun Antique-store, she stayed there for a while, then left.

Stand owners had mixed emotions when they saw Gu Ning. They hoped that she could stop before their stands, but they didn’t want her to buy their antiques.

If she stopped before their stands, it meant that there were real antiques and they could sell them to make money on their own. However, if she wanted to buy the real antiques, they didn’t dare to refuse in case she was displeased. Therefore, they had mixed emotions.

Along the way, Gu Ning didn’t stop before another stand, because there were no more real antiques. Even if she saw a real one, it wasn’t worth a lot of money, so Gu Ning did nothing.

It was impossible for her to go ahead and tell the stand owner that there was a real antique on his stand.

After leaving the antique street, she went back to the Southern District. It was time for lunch, so they dined outside.

After having lunch, she went back to her company, then in the afternoon, she took Gao Yi and Qiao Ya to have dinner at the siheyuan.

Because she was going to City B tomorrow, it would be the last meal she had with Shangguan Yang and the others at the siheyuan.

It wasn’t the first time that Gao Yi and Qiao Ya had visited the siheyuan. They were familiar with Shangguan Yang and Jing Yunyao, so it wasn’t inconvenient for Gu Ning to take them with her.

Although Gao Yi and Qiao Ya didn’t ask about it, they knew that both Shangguan Yang and Jing Yunyao were people with magical power. Therefore, they had great respect for them.

In fact, even if they weren’t people with magical power, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya would still respect them, because they were senior to Gu Ning.

Because of Gao Yi and Qiao Ya’s presence, they weren’t as carefree as usual.

After having the meal and a rest, Gu Ning left with Gao Yi and Qiao Ya. She also told them that she was going back to City B tomorrow.

She would leave tomorrow afternoon, so she would visit Master Leng in the morning.

Because she would go visit him tomorrow morning, she told Master Leng in advance.

Master Leng was very happy to hear that Gu Ning was coming to see him.

At 9 am the next day, Gu Ning went to the Leng family’s house. The seniors were out for work, while the young were home. However, Leng Shaojia locked herself in the room all the time. Only Leng Shaoxi and Leng Shaoxun stayed in the living room with Master Leng.

Actually, they sat there because they knew that Gu Ning would come, otherwise they would go to deal with their own business.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya didn’t follow Gu Ning to visit the Leng family, because they would be very embarrassed and nervous. Therefore, Gu Ning drove there alone and told Gao Yi and Qiao Ya to wait for her at her place.

Everyone was happy to see Gu Ning, except for Leng Shaojia. Normally, Leng Shaojia would walk around once in a while, but she directly hid when Gu Ning came. She even told a servant to serve food to her in her room.

Gu Ning felt nothing about it. She didn’t force Leng Shaojia to stay in her room; Leng Shaojia was the one who refused to go out.

Gu Ning’s flight would take off at 3:50 pm, so she left the Leng family’s house at 2 pm to head to the airport. She told Gao Yi and Qiao Ya to take a taxi to meet her there. Otherwise, it would be troublesome if she had to go back to Century City which was in another district.

Gu Ning arrived at the airport earlier than them, so she went to get her plane ticket and passed the security check.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya arrived ten minutes later. It was twenty minutes away from the departure time.

By the time they arrived at City B it was 6 pm.

After they left the airport, it was 6:20 pm, so they took a taxi to the city center and dined outside..
