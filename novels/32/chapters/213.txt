Chapter 216: The Old Lady Is Driven Away

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Man couldn’t imagine the result if Gu Ning hadn’t beaten those hoodlums down.

“Mom, I’m fine. Don’t worry,” Gu Ning immediately comforted her mother. If the old lady hadn’t been so unreasonable, Gu Ning wouldn’t have said it in public. She was unwilling to upset her mother and aunt, and also didn’t want to expose her terrible experience in front of strangers.

Gu Qing couldn’t help weeping too. She snapped at the old lady, “How could you be so cruel? Go away right now! I don’t have a mother like you!”

At that time, nobody thought that Gu Qing’s behavior was inappropriate, because the old lady deserved it. Everyone had sympathy for Gu Man, Gu Qing and Gu Ning now.

Seeing that the old lady didn’t move at all, Gu Qing ordered a manager beside her, “Manager Chen, please take this old lady out and let the security guards handle it. If she dares to cause any trouble again, call the police.”

“Sure!” A woman who was around 30-years-old followed by several men walked out without delay. They violently pulled the old lady towards the outside.

“Gu Qing, how dare you do this to me! I am your mother!” The old lady had never been humiliated like that before. She trembled in anger and shock, but failed to resist.

The minute that Manager Chen and the other men grabbed the old lady, pulling her out, two security guards who had been informed arrived. Manager Chen then handed the old lady to the security guards and briefly told them what had just happened.

After that, two security guards forced the old lady to leave without hesitation.

The old lady was driven away, and the crowd dispersed afterwards. Those customers who were in the middle of skincare didn’t leave just because of the drama, but comforted Gu Qing and Gu Man before they continued.

Apparently, Gu Qing and Gu Man were both admired by their staff and the customers.

The old lady kept swearing on her way out of the shopping mall. The two security guards didn’t let her go until they were outside, but they didn’t leave right away. Instead, they fixed their eyes on the old lady in case she tried slide in and cause any trouble again.

Although the old lady was mad, she could do nothing under the surveillance of security guards. She called Gu Qinxiang, telling him what had just happened.

The old lady kept blaming Gu Qing, Gu Man and Gu Ning, and didn’t think that it was her fault at all.

Gu Qinxiang was shocked by his mother’s stupid behavior, and demanded that she go back home right away.

What his mother had done was so shameful, and Gu Qing as well as Gu Man had Mrs. Hao’s support now. The Gu Family was barely comparable to the Hao Family.

The old lady knew nothing about it, but she listened to Gu Qinxiang and went back home. She decided to wait for another chance.

When the old lady got back home, Lin Lijuan immediately understood that she had failed. Lin Lijuan was so disappointed. However, she still asked, “Mom, how was it?”

She wanted to know how Gu Qing and Gu Man managed to handle the old lady.

“Gu Ning the b*st*rd! She said that Gu Man’s money has nothing to do with me! She would even only allow Gu Qing and Gu Man to give me a thousand yuan every month. I’m not a beggar!” the old lady said in anger.

Although she already lived a good life in Gu Qinxiang’s place, and even had a savings of around a hundred thousand yuan, she simply wanted to seize Gu Man’s and Gu Qing’s money.

“Gu Ning?” Lin Lijuan was full of anger when she heard Gu Ning’s name. If it hadn’t been for Gu Ning, Gu Xiaoxiao wouldn’t have had to transfer to another school. The National College Entrance Exam was just around the corner, and the school transfer could affect Gu Xiaoxiao’s studying.

It was meaningless and useless to talk about reason with a selfish person, because she was so self-centered and didn’t care about others at all. It was her fault, but she would still blame others for that.

The old lady couldn’t calm down. She went back to her room, calling Gu Qinyang, and told him everything.

“What? Gu Qing and Gu Man are rich now? They acquired a beauty salon? Where did they get their money from?”

Gu Qinyang was more than shocked and felt jealous when he heard the news. Gu Qing and Gu Man had always been the poorest in the Gu Family, but now they had a salon with millions of yuan in assets, while Gu Qinyang himself only had a hundred thousand yuan.

“I have no idea where their money came from, but they’re suddenly rich now. That’s the reason why they quit their jobs, moved into another place, and even refuse to answer our calls. They totally forgot us!” the old lady complained.

Gu Qinyang absolutely knew what his mother like. She must have said something terrible and was driven away by Gu Qing and Gu Man. However, he was also mad at Gu Qing and Gu Man because they had “abandoned” him too once they became rich. He felt like he lost the respect from his two sisters.

Thus he immediately called Gu Qing after he hung up the call with his mother.

Gu Qing understood why Gu Qinyang called her. She didn’t want to answer it in the beginning, but she was also clear that if she didn’t answer it, he would keep calling her forever. She couldn’t turn her phone off, because she was running a business now. In the end, Gu Qing answered it.

Facing Gu Qinyang’s question, Gu Qing argued back using what Gu Ning had said to the old lady. She even asked Gu Qinyang whether he would still be quiet if the old lady and Gu Qinxiang’s family humiliated them like usual.

The old lady aimed at Gu Man and Gu Ning, but she also hated and always swore at Gu Qing too. Gu Qing, therefore, had no good feelings towards her mother, but had a close relationship with Gu Man. Naturally, Gu Qing stood with Gu Man and Gu Ning. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Gu Qinyang didn’t know what to say, because he was so used to discriminating against Gu Qing and Gu Man. Especially when Gu Qing had married Jiang Xu who was poor, and Gu Man had gotten pregnant before being married, Gu Qinyang despised them more. However, he had only laughed at Gu Man and Gu Qing, and hadn’t hurled abuse at them. It was his mother who had always treated them so unfairly.

Gu Ning was right by Gu Qing’s side. She told Gu Qing to give the phone to her.

Gu Ning then said, “Uncle, this’s Gu Ning. I call you my uncle just because there isn’t a considerable grudge between us. And let me tell you this, except for my aunt’s family, I hate all the rest in the Gu Family. We haven’t cut your family off yet, but it doesn’t mean that we won’t. You probably think that I’m being too proud, but that’s the truth. You better face it. If you still take my mother and my aunt as your sisters, please stop interfering in our personal affairs. If you want to scheme against us like Gu Qinxiang’s family, I’ll pay you back! I’m not just saying that. Gu Xiaoxiao is a great example!”
