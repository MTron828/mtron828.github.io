2937 I Came to Find You

Nevertheless, it was also very barren. There were either grasslands, deserts, or Gobi, but the cities that could really accommodate people were very small.

After arriving in City Feng, the Demon City Desert was still far away, but they didn’t need to take a car. They could fly directly with the sword, since it was faster than any other means of transportation. After all, the fastest plane could only reach City Feng.

It just so happened that it was nighttime when they arrived in City Feng, so after getting out of the plane, they could fly to the edge of the Demon City Desert as soon as they got to a place where no people and surveillance cameras were around.

Because Gu Ning wasn’t very good at flying a sword yet, in order to not waste time, she went on the same sword with Jing Yunyao.

Before they set off, they asked Leng Shaoting to send them the location.

Half an hour later, they arrived at the edge of the Demon City Desert and went to meet Leng Shaoting according to the location.

Because it was wilderness everywhere, there were no clear signs. They had to rely on themselves to search and used their magical sense to feel each other.

About ten minutes later, Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao finally met Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting was alone, because his other comrades were staying somewhere else. Because ninjas and mutants were involved, they would only burden him if they went with him.

They were no match for the ninjas and mutants.

“How is the situation now?” Jing Yunyao asked Leng Shaoting.

“The Demon City Desert is too big. And the terrain is relatively steep. It’s very difficult to find people, so we can only search separately to find them as soon as possible. And there may be mutants on the road. Once you encounter them, kill them. They are useless anyway. If you meet ninjas, you can follow them first, or question them directly. I want to know where they took our people. If they refuse to talk, just kill them,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Great, then we can start searching separately,” Jing Yunyao said.

“Ningning, can you protect yourself?” Leng Shaoting turned to look at Gu Ning worriedly. He worried about Gu Ning’s safety, because Gu Ning was at a lower level and wasn’t familiar with flying a sword.

He understood that Gu Ning was very strong, but he still had worries.

However, it was a key moment so he had to leave her.

In fact, if he didn’t have confidence in Gu Ning, he wouldn’t allow her to take action alone. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.” Gu Ning smiled.

“Great.” Leng Shaoting nodded. “I found nothing yet, but since there are ninjas and mutants, I think their base might be here. It might be hidden under the ground, so we must pay attention to the space under the ground too. If we find it, don’t take action right away. Remember the route and share the news with the others at a place that has a signal. We’ll take action together. We can look at our phone every two hours. Remember to wait for ten minutes at a place with signal before starting searching again.”

“No problem.” Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao replied.

Afterwards, they walked away separately.

Leng Shaoting didn’t leave until Gu Ning completely disappeared from his sight.

Because there was no one around, they still flew on a sword to look around, since it would be faster.

They didn’t rely on their eyes to look, and instead used their senses. Gu Ning’s magical sense wasn’t as strong as Leng Shaoting’s and Jing Yunyao’s, but her Jade Eyes was more useful, so she used that.

Like Leng Shaoting just said, this place was very large and had a rocky terrain, so it wasn’t easy to find an underground room in such a large desert. It was dark now, so they still had difficulties along the way.

After searching for a long time, they found nothing.

Luckily, they had special tools, so they were faster than ordinary people.

A few hours later, Gu Ning saw two ninjas.

At the beginning, she didn’t attract their attention. Instead, she followed them silently, but they were walking out of the city, so Gu Ning stopped following them and directly blocked their way.

The moment they saw Gu Ning, they were alert. Although it was just a girl, she couldn’t be simple since she dared to show up in such a dangerous desert at night.

“Who are you?” They asked in the local language.

“I came to find you,” Gu Ning responded.

The two ninjas frowned and asked, “Find us? Why?”

“What are you doing here?” Gu Ning asked.

“It has nothing to do with you.” They argued with displeasure.

“It does. Did you catch two of our people?” Gu Ning directly asked.

Hearing that, the two ninjas panicked a little. Obviously, they were aware of it.

When they were silent, Gu Ning asked again, “Given your reaction, I can be sure that you indeed caught two of our people. Where did you take them?”

“To where they should be,” they answered. They didn’t deny that they had caught two citizens from Country Hua, because they took Gu Ning lightly.

She couldn’t be simple because she dared to show up here alone, but they didn’t think she was stronger than them.

“Well, it seems I have to beat you to get the answer.” Gu Ning put on an evil smile, then attacked them.

Seeing that, the two ninjas immediately fought back.

Although they were strong, they were not comparable to Gu Ning, as a result, they were at a disadvantage right away, surprising them.

They didn’t think that Gu Ning would be stronger than them, but unexpectedly she was much stronger than they could imagine.

How? Did she have superpowers?

That was the only explanation they could think of, because ordinary people could not fight against them, but Gu Ning was at an obvious advantage.

They did their best to fight back, but unfortunately still lost.

In the end, they wanted to run away, but Gu Ning didn’t give them a chance. The moment they moved, Gu Ning stopped them and beat them.

Looking down her nose at them, Gu Ning asked seriously, “Tell me, where are they right now?”

“We don’t know.” They answered.

“You don’t know? Do you really think I’d believe it?” Gu Ning asked.
