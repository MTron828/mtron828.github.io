Chapter 592 Aimee Stalks Gu Ning

Even though Situ Ye disliked her, he seldom lost his temper in front of her and would avoid arguing with her most of the time. However, he shouted at her for Gu Ning this time, and even told her to be respectful of Gu Ning. It was hard for her to not believe that Situ Ye treated Gu Ning differently. In addition, she had to admit that Gu Ning was very attractive, which made her feel jealous.

When they arrived at the private room and pushed the door open, Chu Xuanfeng stood up at once to welcome them.

“Gu Ning!” Chu Xuanfeng was surprised to see Gu Ning. “Hi, Xuanfeng!” Gu Ning said.

“Come here! Have a seat please.” Chu Xuanfeng pulled a chair out for Gu Ning to sit down and behaved like a gentleman.

Seeing Chu Xuanfeng being so gentle to Gu Ning too, Aimee was more displeased because as Situ Ye’s close assistant Chu Xuanfeng didn’t like talking to her.

Situ Ye squinted at Chu Xuanfeng. “Don’t you see me still standing here?” He was just joking of course.

Chu Xuanfeng’s body stiffened a little then he realized that he had ignored his own boss. He beamed at once. “Gu Ning is the guest after all. Please, boss, here.”

Situ Ye didn’t mind, and walked to the seat next to Gu Ning.

Seeing that, Aimee was annoyed and couldn’t wait to set them apart.

Adam who knew Aimee very well, pulled her to sit aside without delay, in case she would cause an argument again.

Although Aimee felt dissatisfied, she still sat down with Adam.

“Gu Ning, I’ve finished ordering, but you may order some of your favorite food now.” Chu Xuanfeng gave the menu to Gu Ning.

Right at this moment, Situ Ye gave Chu Xuanfeng a warning glance. It seemed like he was warning Chu Xuanfeng not to be too gentle to Gu Ning, which might cause a misunderstanding. Instead, he should be the one doing that.

Receiving Situ Ye’s warning glance, Chu Xuanfeng’s hand which was holding the menu stiffened a little. Is boss being jealous? All of a sudden, Chu Xuanfeng felt quite aggrieved, and didn’t know how to explain it.

Gu Ning noticed the conflict between them but ignored it, and said to Chu Xuanfeng, “It’s fine. I’m not picky.”

“Great!” Since Gu Ning said that, Chu Xuanfeng didn’t insist. Most importantly, he was scared of his boss’s glance.

Aimee couldn’t tolerate it anymore, and made an excuse walking outside. However, nobody stopped her.

“I’m so sorry. I hope Aimee doesn’t ruin your appetite,” Adam apologized to them.

“It’s OK. Never mind,” Situ Ye said airily. He thought that it would be better if Aimee was absent. After all, Situ Ye maintained a good relationship with the Hill family, and they had helped each other a lot, so he wouldn’t punish her for the sake of the Hill family even though he disliked her. As long as what Aimee did didn’t exceed his limits, he would be tolerant.

A few minutes later, the dishes were all on the table, and they started to enjoy the meal.

“Gu Ning, what are you up to recently?” Situ Ye asked.

“I’m busy dealing with the opening ceremony of a branch of my jewelry store, and I came to City G this time to fetch jade jewelry,” Gu Ning said.

She actually didn’t want to tell Situ Ye, because she knew that he was going to send her an expensive gift once he heard of it. However, if she didn’t tell him now, he would find out sooner or later, and he would probably blame her for not telling him earlier.

“A branch? Where?” Situ Ye asked.

“In City B,” Gu Ning said. “When is the opening ceremony? Am I invited?” Situ Ye said, staring straight at Gu Ning.

Gu Ning was amused. She knew what Situ Ye was implying. “Of course you are and I’ll tell you once the date is settled.”

After the meal, Gu Ning left to deal with her business.

Before long, Gu Ning discovered that someone was following her. She turned around and noticed a taxi following behind her car. It was Aimee.

Gu Ning wasn’t surprised at all. Nevertheless, she didn’t want Aimee to find out the location of her factory in case she would do something to damage it in the future, so she told the driver to stop the car when there was less traffic.

“Wait for me in the car,” Gu Ning said, then got out.

Aimee, who was following her, got out of the taxi as well. Although Aimee didn’t know what Gu Ning was going to do, her aim was to catch Gu Ning. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“What do you want to do by stalking me?” Gu Ning asked directly.

Aimee was surprised that Gu Ning had already discovered that she was stalking her.

“What’s your relationship with Situ?” Aimee asked.

“None of your business,” Gu Ning said.

“You...” Aimee was mad, and said with an evil expression, “He’s my man, and I won’t allow any women to seduce him!”

Aimee didn’t care whether Gu Ning was innocent, she believed that it must have been Gu Ning who seduced Situ Ye first.

“He didn’t admit that you’re his woman,” Gu Ning said coldly.

“None of your business! I won’t allow any woman to approach Situ!” Aimee was furious.

Gu Ning thought that Aimee was exactly like Feng Xueqin, who also went crazy from love.

“What do you want to do?” Gu Ning crossed her arms over her chest.

Aimee clenched her teeth in anger. “I’ll ruin your face, so Situ won’t like you anymore.” Saying that, she took out a fruit knife from her pocket and attacked Gu Ning at once. Aimee exercised a lot so she moved fast, and slashed at Gu Ning’s face within a second. She raised the knife in her hand to cut Gu Ning’s face.
