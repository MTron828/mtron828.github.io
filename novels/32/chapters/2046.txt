Chapter 2047: Do You Want Me to Be Stuffed?

Leng Shaoting was in the hotel right now. Because he now was at a higher level than those cultivators who came to spy on Gu Ning, he would find them before they noticed him. So he came over once he sensed no air of cultivators near the hotel.

After that, Gu Ning met Leng Shaoting and they went to the room where Tang Yunfan and Tang Haifeng stayed.

When it was time for them to leave, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning sent them to the airport.

Although Tang Jiakai and Cao Wenxin would stay in the capital for two more days, they still went to send Tang Haifeng and Tang Yunfan to the airport along with Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

Tang Haifeng and Tang Yunfan were unwilling to leave Gu Ning because they hadn’t seen each other for a long time and this meeting was very short. They had to separate again very soon. However, they all had their own things to deal with, so it was unavoidable.

After Tang Haifeng and Tang Yunfan left, Gu Ning said to Leng Shaoting on their way back to the city center, “Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye came today. They didn’t show up in public because of their background, so I invited them to share a meal this afternoon. Will you come?”

Because she knew Leng Shaoting had some grudges with Qi Tianlin, they would have conflict if they met. She could stop them, but the atmosphere would be unkind, so she needed to ask for Leng Shaoting’s opinions first.

“I don’t think I should go.” Leng Shaoting refused. Although he was unwilling to let Gu Ning go to dine with them, he knew that they were simply friends. He wasn’t worried about that, and he merely disliked Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye. However, even if he disliked them, he couldn’t stop Gu Ning from making friends. In addition, Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye were very helpful.

Since he said that, Gu Ning didn’t insist. “Alright, you can have a meal nearby with Jiakai and Wenxi. I’ll go to see you once I’m done.”

Gu Ning didn’t bother to ask Tang Jiakai and Cao Wenxin whether they would go with her, because she knew they wouldn’t. They were so afraid of Qi Tianlin, and they would only feel uncomfortable if they went there.

Back in the clubhouse, it was already 6:10 pm. It wasn’t early, but wasn’t very late either, so neither Qi Tianlin nor Situ Ye called to urge her. They knew that Gu Ning didn’t have much free time today, and she would come since she promised to come. If she couldn’t, she would let them know earlier.

At 6:20 pm, Gu Ning went to the private room they were in. In the private room, the atmosphere was tense before Gu Ning came. Although Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye reached an agreement to some extent, it didn’t mean they could get along well with each other. They were always competing against one another.

People who stayed in the same room as them found it difficult to breathe.

Once Gu Ning came, they became gentle.

Chu Xuanfeng and the other people couldn’t admire Gu Ning more now, because she was the only one who was able to receive such good treatment from these two gang bosses.

Even those who had a close relationship with them couldn’t see them being so kind.

That must be the power of love. Even if Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye were only Gu Ning’s friends, both of them liked her.

During the meal, Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye competed against each other to put dishes into Gu Ning’s bowl with a pair of separate chopsticks, so it wasn’t inappropriate. Gu Ning, however, didn’t know what to say, seeing the large pile of dishes in her bowl.

She could eat a lot, but couldn’t eat so much! Besides, her bowl now became a battlefield in the war between Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye.

“Alright, enough, you two.” Gu Ning was slightly annoyed. “Go out and have a fight if you want. Stop using my bowl as your battlefield. Or are you dissatisfied with me? Do you want me to be stuffed?”

Hearing that, Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye stopped, feeling upset.

A fight wasn’t necessary, and they couldn’t do that right now even if they were really going to have a fight because Gu Ning would certainly leave.

Neither of them was dissatisfied with Gu Ning.

Chu Xuanfeng and the other people admired Gu Ning now more than ever, because only Gu Ning dared to vent her anger on them and they weren’t mad at all.

After Gu Ning snapped at them, they stopped putting dishes into her bowl because she could barely finish the food in her bowl.

Gu Ning didn’t care much about that. She would do her best to finish the food. In the end, almost half of the food was left in the bowl.

After having the meal, both Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye wanted Gu Ning to stay for a while longer or have fun with them in the clubhouse, but Gu Ning said she needed to see her cousins, so she had to leave.

Since she said that, Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye didn’t insist. And since Gu Ning was going to leave, Qi Tianlin and Situ Ye separated too.

Chu Xuanfeng would drive Chu Peihan to her school later so they could spend more time together. Chu Xuanfeng would leave early in the morning tomorrow, and neither of them knew when they would meet again.

As soon as Gu Ning left, she went to see Leng Shaoting and the others.

Because she didn’t dine with them, she planned to go to have fun with them in a bar or club tonight. She called Zi Beiying to join them.

…

When Chu Xuanfeng drove Chu Peihan back to her school, something unpleasant happened.

Chu Xuanfeng borrowed a car from the hotel to send Chu Xuanfeng to school, which was Situ Ye’s temporary car today. They didn’t have influence in the capital, so they could only borrow a car from the hotel.

Even though it was a car they borrowed from the hotel, it was a luxurious car which cost over a million yuan, so it aroused suspicions and rumors when Chu Peihan went back to her school in it.

There were many rich heirs in their school, so it wasn’t uncommon to see luxurious cars. However, if they were unfamiliar with the owners of the luxurious cars, they would have unkind opinions.

It was unfair, but was understandable.

Because it was a film academy, most students went to this school for fame. The entertainment industry was also notorious for its amoral unspoken rules, so it was very common that many female students sold their bodies for money for fame.

Some people kept it in private, but some didn’t. On the contrary, they chose to make it public to show off her connections. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Oh, the girl just got out of a luxurious car. Has she found herself a sugar-daddy?”

Four girls just reached the gate of their school. After witnessing Chu Peihan get out of the luxurious car, they began to discuss it.

“Who knows! Isn’t it very common in our school?” Girl B said.

“Perhaps it’s her family’s car. Don’t just defame girls for getting out of luxurious cars,” said Girl C.
