Chapter 600 A Battle Between Fans

“Wang Wei, Shen Ruiyin behaves like a 3-year-old child, are you’re a kid too? If you have the ability to make the general manager order me to shoot for her, I’ll listen to you. If you don’t, get out now!” Fei Nan coldly said to Wang Wei.

Wang Wei was furious, but he didn’t know what to say, because he didn’t have the ability to make the general manager help him, so he could only pull Shen Ruiyin walking away. However, when Shen Ruiyin walked past Su Tongnuo, she recognized Su Tongnuo’s face, and couldn’t believe her eyes.

“Su Tongnuo!” Shen Ruiyin was surprised. She was so jealous of Su Tongnuo when Su Tongnuo had become a hot topic on the Internet a while ago. Although Shen Ruiyin was already a B-list actress now, Su Tongnuo was still more famous and beautiful than her, which made Shen Ruiyin feel jealous too.

All of a sudden, Shen Ruiyin turned to Fei Nan and criticized him seriously, “Fei Nan, you’re shooting for an actress from another entertainment company. Don’t you know that it’s not allowed in our company?”

It sounded like she was his boss, but actually she wasn’t. However, Shen Ruiyin was right. Fei Nan worked for Tanghuang Entertainment, and he according to the rules shouldn’t shoot for other actors from other entertainment companies, because they were competitors. Unfortunately, she didn’t know that it was their boss who assigned this task to Fei Nan.

“Shen Ruiyin, report me or not, but go away!” Fei Nan totally lost his patience and got mad.

“You...” Shen Ruiyin was struck speechless.

“Let’s go now!” Looking at Fei Nan’s attitude Wang Wei realized that this shoot could have been arranged by the senior management, so he didn’t dare stay here any longer and pulled Shen Ruiyin walking outside.

Although Shen Ruiyin was annoyed, she listened to Wang Wei and followed him, walking away.

Once Wang Wei and Shen Ruiyin were gone, Gu Ning introduced Su Tongnuo and Fei Nan to one another before Su Tongnuo went to put on make-up.

“Wang Wei, how could Fei Nan do that to us!” Shen Ruiyin pouted and complained to Wang Wei when they walked out of the photo studio.

“Alright, I think that the shoot must have been arranged or allowed by the senior management today, so Fei Nan remained so tough,” Wang Wei said. He was annoyed too.

Since Wang Wei said that, Shen Ruiyin didn’t say anything further, but she had no intention to let it go.

“Well, you can go to work now. I need to deal with something else now,” Wang Wei said then turned around walking away.

When Wang Wei left, Shen Ruiyin said to her assistant, “Take a photo of my back and tell Xiao Du to send me a picture of what’s going on in the photo studio now. Be quick!”

Xiao Du worked in the photo studio too, and he came from the same village as Shen Ruiyin’s assistant, so they maintained a good relationship. Because of Shen Ruiyin’s assistant, Xiao Du had done Shen Ruiyin a lot of favors, and he also had gained many benefits from Shen Ruiyin.

Hearing that, Shen Ruiyin’s assistant understood that she was going to slander Su Tongnuo. As Shen Ruiyin’s assistant, she was worried that the scheme would be exposed, but she had to obey Shen Ruiyin’s order.

After that, she took a picture of Shen Ruiyin’s back along with the outside of the photo studio. Later, she sent a message to Xiao Du, and Shen Ruiyin went to shoot.

Actors needed many beautiful and professional photos. Some of them were for promotion, while others might be posted on the official websites of their companies.

About an hour later, Shen Ruiyin’s assistant received a picture taken by Xiao Du. He took the picture secretly from afar, so it wasn’t clear, but it was enough.

Shen Ruiyin was in the middle of shooting now, so she planned to conduct her scheme later.

When they had a break at noon, Shen Ruiyin logged into a Weibo account which few people knew was hers. Although this Weibo account didn’t have as many followers as her official account, it still had hundreds of thousands of followers.

Shen Ruiyin posted the two pictures on Weibo at once.

Big news! Rude Su Tongnuo grabbed the photo studio and photographer away from poor Shen Ruiyin, who left in loneliness. [Pictures Attached]

Once the news was out, it went viral, and it threw a bomb among Shen Ruiyin’s fans.

“Who the hell is Su Tongnuo?”

“I think she’s an actress who just became popular again.”

“She’s so rude!”

“How dare she grab the photo studio and photographer away from Ruiyin!”

Although the amount of Su Tongnuo’s fans was smaller than Shen Ruiyin’s, she had many loyal fans who stood out to defend her at this moment.

“Enough! Do you have evidence? These are just two pictures, which can’t prove anything.”

“Exactly! It’s just a publicity stunt.”

“Ruiyin is already famous now. She doesn’t need a publicity stunt!”

“No solid evidence. It’s just a slander! Support Tongnuo.”

“Support Tongnuo!” “You’re crazy fans just like your crazy idol.”

“F*ck off!”

“Shen Ruiyin, why don’t you explain it in person?”

“Agree!”

Shen Ruiyin’s fans and Su Tongnuo’s fans began to argue fiercely on Weibo, which attracted a lot of attention from common Internet users, and they joined the battle too.

“Wow, Fenghua Entertainment is competing against Tanghuang Entertainment!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“I heard Fenghua Entertainment isn’t officially established yet.”

Some staff working for Tanghuang Entertainment also saw the news, and they were all surprised that Su Tongnuo was in the middle of shooting in their company now. Several of them were Su Tongnuo’s fans too, so they ran to have a look, but Su Tongnuo and the others had already left for lunch.

At the same time, they didn’t believe that Su Tongnuo had grabbed the photo studio and photographer away from Shen Ruiyin.
