Chapter 441 Tang Yunfan’s Dream Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Tang Yunfan was willing to have Gu Ning as his family, but Gu Man was also involved in this mess, so he wanted to regain his memory first. So that he would be able to accept it with his true feelings. He hoped that he could bring them both home.

Tang Haifeng didn’t know what he was thinking, and was mad at once. “Why? Since everyone accepted it, we need to hold the party as soon as possible!”

No one was more eager than Tang Haifeng to announce to people around him that Gu Ning was his granddaughter now.

“I agree with father. If we’re going to hold the party sooner or later, it needs to be grand,” Tang Yunhang said.

“I have my reasons, so listen to me this time,” Tang Yunfan said in an undeniable tone, then he directly walked upstairs. Tang Haifeng was furious, but didn’t know what to say. Obviously, Tang Yunfan had his own plan. Tang Haifeng thought that maybe he wasn’t willing to take Gu Ning as his daughter, while Tang Yunhang suddenly thought of what he had discussed with Cao Ruihua.

Is it possible that Yunfan found out Gu Ning’s hidden reason which explained why she approached our family, so he doesn’t want to rush? That was just Tang Yunhang’s pure conjecture, so it wasn’t appropriate for him to say it out right now.

Gu Ning and the others had taken the boat on the river for two hours before they went back home.

When they were home, Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin immediately booked plane tickets to the capital for the next morning. They would fly to the capital around 8:10 am, and would arrive there around 10:30 am. Gu Ning planned to have lunch downtown before she went to deal with her own business.

After booking plane tickets, Cao Wenxin went back to her house, and Gu Ning talked with Leng Shaoting on the phone for at least an hour. Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting that she would fly to the capital along with Cao Wenxin, but she didn’t tell him that she was going to introduce Xu Jinchen to Cao Wenxin. Instead, she asked whether Xu Jinchen and Xu Qinyin were free, so that they could dine together.

Leng Shaoting didn’t think further and agreed with alacrity. Gu Ning then told Leng Shaoting the time that she would arrive at the capital.

The Huangdeng Hotel was also in the capital, and Cao Wenxin had her own Black Card, so she would stay in her family’s hotel.

After hanging up the call with Leng Shaoting, it was around 11 pm. Gu Ning opened her WeChat and checked their WeChat group. Her friends all knew that she was busy, so they mentioned(@) her and reminded her to take care of herself.

Ever since they had attended Su Anya’s birthday party last time, Su Anya joined their WeChat group. Except Gu Ning who was always absent, the rest of the people were busy chatting and making fun of each other. And although Gu Ning barely showed up, her friends never forgot her. Gu Ning was their boss after all. Without her, they couldn’t maintain such a friendly relationship.

Once Gu Ning appeared, everyone was excited. Even though they just hadn’t seen each other for a few days, it felt like ages.

Gu Ning felt touched that she had a group of real friends.

During this time, Tang Yunfan couldn’t sleep. He couldn’t help thinking about Gu Ning and Gu Man, and he kept forcing himself to get his lost memory back. However, no matter how hard he tried, he didn’t have any clue. In the end, Tang Yunfan couldn’t tolerate it anymore, and he took sleeping pills to fall asleep. However, in his sound dream, he dreamed that an old bus was moving on a road. When it turned, there was a fast oncoming car right ahead of it. The bus tried to avoid the car, but accidentally crashed into the river.

Abruptly, Tang Yunfan woke up from his dream. He had a strong feeling that the dream was real. Thus he did his best to keep the dream in his mind and searched for the map of City D on his computer to see whether there was any river around City D.

Tang Yunfan found out there was a river at a place which was 30 kilometers away from southern City D, and there was also a road which passed by the river. Although he wasn’t sure it was the same road, it was the only road if he had been setting off from City D.

He made up his mind to visit that place.

The next day, Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin got up at 6 am. Cao Wenxin wore light make-up and carried a small suitcase before she walked out.

They would only stay in the capital for about two days, so Cao Wenxin didn’t bring much clothing to change into. On the contrary, Gu Ning’s suitcase was obviously bigger than Cao Wenxin’s. Because Gu Ning didn’t want to expose the secret of her telepathic eye space, she had to pull this suitcase around with her.

Cao Wenxin drove her Land Rover to the airport and left the car there, so that she could use it again when she came back.

After finishing all the procedures, it was still half an hour away from the departure time.

Although Cao Wenxin didn’t carry many things, there was liquid in her baggage, so she had to check it in. Gu Ning did the same thing.

“Gu Ning?”

When they just came in the lounge, Gu Ning heard someone calling her. She looked towards the voice and noticed Qiu Yuxin.

Qiu Yuxin was waving at her not far away.

Seeing Qiu Yuxin, Gu Ning suddenly remembered that Qiu Yuxin lived in City B. She didn’t feel guilty that she hadn’t visited Qiu Yuxin, because they weren’t very familiar after all.

Gu Ning smiled at her and walked over with Cao Wenxin.

“Hi, Yuxin!” Gu Ning said.

When Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin walked near, Qiu Yuxin recognized that the young woman with Gu Ning was Cao Wenxin. She was a little surprised that the two were together. “Hi, Miss Cao!”

They were both from the high society, so they naturally knew each other.

“Miss Qiu, nice to meet you!” Cao Wenxin also recognized Qiu Yuxin. They had met at parties, and Qiu Yuxin was a famous model so Cao Wenxin often saw her pictures on magazine covers.

Qiu Yuxin was a model, but she also had her bottom line. She never wore a bikini or very little clothing in front of a camera; because modeling was just her hobby and she didn’t rely on that to support herself. In addition, Qiu Yuxin was from a super-rich family. It would be a shame to her family if she was naked in front of a camera.

“Where are you flying today?” Qiu Yuxin asked.
