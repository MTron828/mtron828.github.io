Chapter 192 Revenge on Shao Ping

They all agreed that they had to teach Shao Ping a lesson, but they were also concerned that Gu Ning would commit a crime. However, before Zhou Zhenghong could open his mouth, Gu Ning interrupted him. “Relax, I just want to do something to his car, and punish him slightly.”

Zhou Zhenghong relaxed then. He understood that once Gu Ning made up her mind, no one could change it.

Although Shao Ping did it because of him, the Jade Beauty Jewelry was Gu Ning’s brand. If Shao Ping wanted to ruin Jade Beauty Jewelry, he would have bad blood with Gu Ning. He had indeed annoyed Gu Ning now.

Therefore, Zhou Zhenghong said to Gu Ning, “He lives in No. 1003, Building seven, Harmonious Home on XX Road. He drives a black BMW, and its plate number is G332.”

“Is there any spray paint or glue left after the decoration of our store?” Gu Ning asked.

“Yes, we have white spray paint and superglue,” the manager said.

“Give them to me,” Gu Ning said.

The manager immediately ran inside to fetch them. Before long, he came out with a paper bag with three bottles of spray paint and two bottles of superglue in it.

Gu Ning took them saying, “Alright, it’s late now. I think you better stay in the store and have a rest for the sake of your safety!”

After that, she left with Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting understood where Gu Ning was heading to, so he drove straight to the address of Shao Ping’s home. Leng Shaoting wasn’t familiar with the roads in City G, so he used GPS.

There weren’t many cars on the road in the early morning, and they arrived at the Harmonious Home within 20 minutes.

“What do you want to do? Let me help you,” Leng Shaoting said.

“I prefer to do it myself,” Gu Ning declined.

Leng Shaoting felt a little disappointed, but he understood, so he didn’t insist. Gu Ning wasn’t willing to see Leng Shaoting being upset, like she just had hurt him. After a second thought, Gu Ning asked him, “Can you disable the surveillance cameras in this area for me?”

“Sure!” Leng Shaoting’s face immediately lit up. It was a piece of cake for him to do that.

Then without delay the two worked separately. Leng Shaoting went to the surveillance room to turn off the cameras first before he sent Gu Ning a message of success. Gu Ning strode directly to Building 7 afterwards.

She slid into the underground parking lot, finding Shao Ping’s car. Then she used the white spray paint aiming it at his black car, and turned it completely white. She next pulled out tools, which she had prepared for her adventure at Yuntai Mountain, from her Jade Eyes to deflate its four tires. Later, she violently levered the door open, and removed the steering wheel.

After that, Gu Ning took the elevator up to the tenth floor. She stood at the door of apartment No. 03, taking out the superglue she filled the narrow gap between the door and the ground with superglue. At last, she spayed the rest of the spray paint around the door randomly. The door was totally ruined now. Gu Ning was satisfied and left right away.

When she got back in the car, Leng Shaoting asked with curiosity, “What did you do?”

Gu Ning told him everything. The man lifted the corner of his lips. He could imagine Shao Ping’s shocked face when he failed to open the door and saw his car tomorrow.

“Where to now?” Leng Shaoting asked. “Where are you staying?” Gu Ning asked. “In a hotel,” Leng Shaoting replied. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Can you drive me back to Clean Water Blue Sky before you go back to the hotel?” Gu Ning asked.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was slightly upset. They had just met each other, and now she wanted him to leave without spending more private time with him. That left him in a bad.

After a while, Leng Shaoting said to her, “I haven’t eaten yet.”

Um...

Gu Ning was surprised, but she got hungry too when Leng Shaoting said that. “Well, then let’s have night snacks together!”

“Great!” Leng Shaoting said, immediately cheering up.

Many night snack stands were open 24 hours a day, and it was only 2 am. It was the time when most bar lovers who had just come out of a bar went to have something to eat.

Although Leng Shaoting was allergic to seafood, he could eat fish, so they went to have roasted fish. It seemed like the two had a secret agreement to eat slowly until daybreak.

After the night snack, it was almost 4 am. It was too late to go back and sleep, but, what should they do next? They weren’t a couple yet, so there were many things that they couldn’t do. The atmosphere in the car started to get embarrassing.

All of a sudden, Gu Ning had an idea. “Well, why don’t we have a drive around City G? I want to get familiar with it.”

Yes, Gu Ning thought that she should be familiar with City G. And with her unique memory, she could bear everything that she saw along the way in mind.

Leng Shaoting didn’t know what to do either, so he happily agreed with Gu Ning. He drove the car ahead, moving along the street.

At that time, there were drunk people in twos and threes arguing and playing with each other on the streets. And the sanitation workers were already doing their job cleaning the streets.

Without warning, there was a burst of sound from a noisy engine behind them. In the rearview mirror, they saw three cars driving at an extremely high speed racing towards them.

If Gu Ning guessed correctly, they were Mat Rempits[1]

While the three cars were passing by Leng Shaoting’s, the people sitting inside lifted their middle fingers towards them. Those who sat in the three cars all did the same thing.

Both Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were mad. “Let’s surpass them!” Gu Ning said coldly.

Leng Shaoting immediately sped up, chasing them.

In the three cars were young men in their early twenties. They noticed that Leng Shaoting was catching up to them from the rearview mirror, and were surprised, but they soon felt that it was interesting and exciting. They didn’t believe that Leng Shaoting was able to catch up to them. Thus a young man stretched his head from a car shouting at Leng Shaoting, “Come on, baby! If you can catch up to us, I’ll call you my grandpa!”

Both Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning heard it clearly. Gu Ning said with determination, “Let’s do it! I’ll beat them down to the ground!”

They had insulted them, and Gu Ning would never let them get away with it.

Leng Shaoting drove a Porsche which was worth two million yuan. It wasn’t a cheap car, but was slightly cheaper than their professional sports cars which were at the price of four million yuan.

Leng Shaoting was a skillful driver who drove fast and steadily so he soon caught up to them.

The young men in the sports cars were surprised that Leng Shaoting did it so easily. Although they sped up, Leng Shaoting still caught up to them in a few seconds, which greatly upset them. However, the more annoyed they felt, the more they failed to drive well.
