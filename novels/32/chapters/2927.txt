2928 Don’t Need Proof

“If you don’t mind, can I go with you? Perhaps I can help!” the young man, who was called Mr. You, offered. He was curious to see what type of girl could beat a bunch of men.

“Of course not,” Long Weixiong said. It was true that Mr. You might be helpful, after all, Mr. You wasn’t weak.

Although he wasn’t scared of the girl who beat all of his subordinates, he had to be careful since the girl was able to do that. He was afraid that he might be no match for her.

Nevertheless, he had guns so he wasn’t scared.

Afterwards, Mr. You went out with Long Weixiong, then they saw Gu Ning.

“Who are you? How dare you intrude into my manor and injure my people? What do you want?” Long Weixiong looked at Gu Ning coldy, his expression filled with anger.

“I came to see you, Long Weixiong,” Gu Ning said arrogantly.

“What for?” Long Weixiong asked.

“About Zhang Quanliang,” Gu Ning replied.

Zhang Quanliang was the truck driver.

Hearing that, Long Weixiong understood why Gu Ning came, but he was surprised by her efficiency.

Anyway, since Gu Ning was already there, she must know that it had something to do with him, so Long Weixiong became a little anxious.

However, he wouldn’t admit it, because it would be troublesome.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about. I do know a man called Zhang Quanliang, but we’re not familiar. Why did you come to see me regarding him?” Long Weixiong asked. He didn’t deny that they knew each other, but he still wanted to get out of the mess. After all, he didn’t think Gu Ning had evidence.

“Since I came here, I have naturally already found out that it has something to do with you. If you admit and tell me who the mastermind is, I can give you a lighter punishment, but if you refuse, I’m afraid I can only destroy your gang,” Gu Ning said in a flat tone. She didn’t think the Tiger Gang was a big problem.

In fact, it couldn’t be easier for her to ruin them.

“You…” Long Weixiong was furious and shouted, “How dare you!”

He didn’t believe that Gu Ning was able to do that. Although she was very skilled, he didn’t think that she could ruin his gang.

Mr. You had no idea what Zhang Quanliang had done, but he was astonished by Gu Ning’s arrogance. He also refused to believe that she had the ability to ruin the Tiger Gang.

Moreover, he disliked arrogant women.

“I’ll prove it to you, if you don’t believe me,” Gu Ning continued, provoking Long Weixiong.

Long Weixiong was angry, so he decided to teach Gu Ning a lesson. Without delay, he drew his gun and pointed at Gu Ning.

He dared to use guns, because this was a private manor. No one else was around, so it wouldn’t cause any trouble.

Long Weixiong moved very fast, and even skilled people might not be able to avoid the bullet, let alone ordinary people. However, in Gu Ning’s eyes, the bullet couldn’t be slower, so she wasn’t scared at all.

When the bullet was shot, Gu Ning didn’t move right away, which made other people think that she was going to be hit by it. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Long Weixiong was very satisfied.

However, right when they believed the bullet would enter Gu Ning’s body, she slightly turned, causing the bullet to miss her.

Seeing that, everyone was surprised. They felt that she didn’t care about the bullet at all.

How was that possible?

Long Weixiong was reluctant to accept it. He shot at Gu Ning a few more times, but Gu Ning still easily avoided the bullets.

“Even if you had explosives, I wouldn’t be afraid. Do you think your guns can injure me?” Gu Ning mocked disdainfully.

“You…” Long Weixiong didn’t dare to doubt Gu Ning this time. He was shocked to see that she was able to avoid the bullets. He had never seen anyone else do that before.

Therefore, she must have been serious when she threatened to destroy the Tiger Gang.

“Leader Long, you’ve tried, so shouldn’t you answer my question now?” Gu Ning asked.

“Why do you think what Zhang Quanliang has done has anything to do with me?” Long Weixiong asked.

“I did an investigation and found out. Did you really think you could keep it a secret?” Gu Ning laughed at him.

“If so, show me the evidence. Otherwise it’s just slander,” Long Weixiong said. Even though he knew Gu Ning was sure that he was guilty, he still didn’t want to admit it.

If he admitted it, he would be in serious trouble.

“Evidence? Well, I don’t need that. And you should stop wasting time arguing with me. I don’t have the patience. Since I came to see you, you should know that I’m already sure that you are guilty. If you tell me who the mastermind is, I won’t bother you any longer. If not, I’m not joking that I can ruin the Tiger Gang,” Gu Ning said impatiently.

“You…” Long Weixiong was mad, but also hesitated.

Mr. You originally wanted to help Long Weixiong and show his skills, but he gave up after witnessing how Gu Ning avoided the bullets.

He even wanted to leave earlier in case he was dragged into trouble.

Therefore, Mr. You said, “Leader Long, if you’re busy right now, I think I should leave.”

Long Weixiong understood that Mr. You didn’t want to be affected, but that was normal since he wasn’t a member of the Tiger Gang.

However, Long Weixiong was still displeased, because Mr. You had just promised to help him, but now wanted to run away.

Nevertheless, he couldn’t force Mr. You to stay, so he had to agree. “Please, Mr. You.”

Mr. You didn’t care about his opinion and immediately left with his two servants.

Gu Ning didn’t stop him, because she could see that Mr. You wasn’t a member of the Tiger Gang.
