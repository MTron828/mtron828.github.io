Chapter 1968: Meant to Be Together!

“Right, I’ll ask him once we’re home,” said Mrs. Xu at once.

“Why don’t you directly ask Jinchen?” asked Mrs. Xu’s friend.

“If we directly ask Jinchen, Jinchen will know I told you. He’ll be mad at me,” said Xu Qinyin. Actually, Xu Jinchen wouldn’t be mad, but she simply didn’t want him to know that she told his mother about the secret. Therefore, Mrs. Xu gave up the idea of asking Xu Jinchen.

…

Zi Beiying didn’t feel relieved till she had walked far away.

Nan joked with her. “Miss, it seems that Mrs. Xu likes you very much.”

“Why did you say that? It has nothing to do with me!” Zi Beiying felt a little awkward and immediately retorted in annoyance. It seemed she was mad at being wronged.

In fact, she felt relaxed after seeing Mrs. Xu’s good attitude towards her. After all, no one was willing to leave a bad impression on their seniors.

“Fine, it has nothing to do with you.” Nan stopped at once, knowing Zi Beiying felt embarrassed now.

“I have a feeling that you’ll stay in the capital for a long time in the future.” Xia Maiqi joked too. Although she didn’t know much, she could see Zi Beiying was like a daughter-in-law in front of Mrs. Xu when they met.

It seemed Zi Beiying already found a man she liked and the man must be Mrs. Xu’s son, but obviously Mrs. Xu didn’t know Zi Beiying was her son’s girl.

“Stop joking about it!” said Zi Beiying. She seemed mad on the surface, but felt even more embarrassed now.

“Hey, aren’t we friends? I need to know some details!” Xia Maiqi knocked her elbow against Zi Beiying’s arm with great curiosity.

“There is nothing you need to know,” said Zi Beiying. She didn’t mean to keep it secret from Xia Maiqi, but there was really nothing special between her and Xu Jinchen now, so she thought she better not say anything.

“Fine! There must be something different between you two. I can see that from your reaction. Stop lying to my face!” said Xia Maiqi, seeming annoyed, but she actually wasn’t mad at all. She knew Zi Beiying’s character to some extent, so she understood that Zi Beiying refused to tell her details for a reason. Anyway, she could figure it out by guessing.

“Well, I just have a good impression of a man, but we aren’t girlfriend and boyfriend yet, so I don’t want to talk about it.” Zi Beiying understood Xia Maiqi wasn’t really mad, but she didn’t want her to be displeased, so she decided to be honest in the end.

“Is the man Mrs. Xu’s son?” asked Xia Maiqi. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Yeah,” Zi Beiying said.

“Is it because of you or the man that you aren’t girlfriend and boyfriend yet?” asked Xia Maiqi. She wasn’t interfering in Zi Beiying’s personal affair, but simply cared about her.

“Both of us, I think. Although we know we like each other, it’s not the right time to move forward, so we’re just friends for the time being,” said Zi Beiying. She wasn’t prepared either, so she didn’t think it was a bad thing.

“How does he treat you?” asked Xia Maiqi. She agreed with Zi Beiying. Perhaps some people didn’t think the man really liked the woman if he delayed confessing his affection towards her, because some people believed that one must say his love aloud as long as it was real.

However, others never easily confessed their affection to people they liked, because they attached great importance to a serious relationship. Different people had different opinions towards relationships. Some needed impulse to move a step forward, while some were much more careful.

“He treats me very well, and he’s stayed with me these days. He left today for work,” said Zi Beiying. She felt a little sad upon thinking that Xu Jinchen left, but didn’t show it on her face.

From Zi Beiying’s reaction, Xia Maiqi knew there was chemistry between them.

…

As soon as Mrs. Xu was home, she directly asked Master Xu, “Dad, do you know the name of the girl Jinchen likes?”

“Why do you ask that? Do you want to investigate the girl?” asked Master Xu instead. He was willing to tell her, but was worried that Mrs. Xu would investigate the girl, which wasn’t appropriate.

“No, I just want to know whether her name is Zi Beiying,” said Mrs. Xu with great anticipation, because she hoped that the girl could be Zi Beiying.

“How do you know?” Master Xu was surprised.

Master Xu’s reaction proved that the girl was called Zi Beiying.

“She’s Zi Beiying, right? Wonderful!” Mrs. Xu was full of joy in an instant.

“How do you know that?” asked Master Xu again. It was obvious that Xu Jinchen didn’t tell her that.

“Well, I think the two kids are meant to be together,” said Mrs. Xu, then she told Master Xu about what had happened today.

After hearing the story, Master Xu agreed that Xu Jinchen and Zi Beiying were meant to be together. After all, the capital was a very large city. It wasn’t easy for Mrs. Xu to meet Zi Beiying.

“Well, I’m wondering whether Jinchen can win the girl’s heart. Although he’s good-looking and has an extraordinary family background, he isn’t good at sweet-nothings. He doesn’t know how to please a girl at all! Besides, the girl is from Country X. I don’t know how long she’ll stay in our country. She’s so pretty and elegant. She must have countless admirers.” Mrs. Xu suddenly became worried about that.

“Country X?” Master Xu was slightly surprised. He didn’t expect Zi Beiying to be a foreigner, because she closely resembled their people.

“Yeah, Zi Beiying is from Country X, but her ancestors were born in our country,” said Mrs. Xu.

“If so, that’ll be a problem.” Master Xu got anxious as well. After all, Xu Jinchen couldn’t enjoy the benefits of a favorable position because of the distance.

“Did you ask the girl when she’ll go home?” asked Master Xu.

“I did. She said she’ll stay here for a while.” Mrs. Xu said, “Well, I think I need to tell Jinchen to work harder on that.”

Saying that, Mrs. Xu took out her phone to call Xu Jinchen at once, but his phone was turned off. He must be out to do a task again.

…

Shortly after Xu Jinchen came back to the military base, they were assigned a task.

Therefore, this afternoon, Leng Shaoting sent Gu Ning a message and told her that he needed to do a task and couldn’t contact her for a few days.

This task originally wouldn’t fall on their shoulders. The tasks they had always done were to fight against and capture criminal gangs as well as foreign spies, and so on, which were all related to national security.
