1171 Break a Promise?

Because of the good insulation, nobody outside could hear any noise from inside the room. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

At the beginning, Lin Xiaoyu’s ghost thought that the punishment wasn’t severe enough, but they gradually became more violent so it was satisfied.

There were no bottles of drinks, but there were two ashtrays in the private room, so the four men began to use an ashtray to hit each other.

Two of them took control of the fight, and the other two men were beaten down on the ground.

When there were only two men left standing in the room, they started to fight against each other.

Wan Chao was out of strength, lying on the floor now, but he was still breathing.

At this moment, Gu Ning walked over and heavily stepped on his knee. With a clear sound, Wan Chao’s leg was broken and he passed out at once.

Gu Ning used her magical power when she stepped on Wan Chao’s knee, so his knee was frozen. She had done the same thing before when she went to rescue Master Jiang’s grandson last time in the capital.

Once Wan Chao’s knee was injured by her magical power, it was impossible for it to be cured again.

She also put a little magical power into his brain to keep him alive.

Lin Xiaoyu’s ghost had said that it hoped that they could all be disabled one day and live the rest of their lives in torture.

Another man was also hit in the head by an ashtray, but the injury wasn’t as serious as the one on Wan Chao’s head, so Gu Ning didn’t bother to help him with her magical power. She then did the same thing to break the man’s leg.

Maybe it was too cruel, but Lin Xiaoyu had suffered more than that.

After a short while, there was finally a winner, and he ran to the door at once. However, Gu Ning stopped him.

“What are you doing?” The man was confused.

“You’ll ruin the business of this bar if you ran outside like this. Relax, I won’t put you in jail,” Gu Ning said.

None of them would be put in jail, but they would be handicapped.

The man exhaled deeply. The next second, to his astonishment, Gu Ning kicked his lap with great force and froze the injury with her magical power.

The man shouted in pain and fell on the ground. He didn’t expect that Gu Ning would attack him all of a sudden, then shouted at her in anger, “You broke your promise!”

“I just said that I won’t put you in jail, but I didn’t promise not to hurt you,” Gu Ning said.

“You...” The man clenched his teeth. He realized that Gu Ning just played a trick with them, but he had to swallow his anger. Unfortunately, he didn’t know that his leg couldn’t be cured.

Without hesitation, Gu Ning did the same thing to the last man.

After that, she called Wu Sen to come inside.

Wu Sen was slightly surprised by the scene, but said nothing.

“Manager Wu, I need you to do something for me,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure,” Wu Sen said.

“Please treat these people and keep them alive before throwing them to another city. Let them be beggars for a month and forbid them to call the police,” Gu Ning said.

She didn’t care what happened to them after a month.

“No problem, Miss Gu,” Wu Sen said.

When Gu Ning turned to look at Lin Xiaoyu’s ghost, she saw that it became transparent and the Yin gradually dispersed.

Gu Ning felt comforted seeing that.

“Thank you so much, Miss Gu,” Lin Xiaoyu’s ghost said to Gu Ning with sincerity.

It already got its revenge, so there was no need for it to stay in the world.

Gu Ning smiled at it and said nothing.

The next second, Lin Xiaoyu’s ghost disappeared in the air.

At the same time, Gu Ning felt the energy inside her body grew a little, but she still didn’t know what it was.

She left later and met Miss Ma in the hall.

Miss Ma glared at Gu Ning with hatred, but she didn’t dare to stand in Gu Ning’s way.

The waiter had already warned her to stay away from Gu Ning because Gu Ning was a distinguished guest.

Miss Ma didn’t know why Wu Sen had to meet Gu Ning in a private room alone, so she was worried that they might be doing something bad inside.

Gu Ning ignored her and left Wind Bar. She called Situ Ye at once and thanked him for his help.

She told Situ Ye that she was leaving for City B tomorrow and they could dine together again next time.

Situ Ye agreed.
