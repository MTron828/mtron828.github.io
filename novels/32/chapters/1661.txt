“Sure.” Jing Yunyao agreed, and got out of the car with Gu Ning. They walked separately as if nothing was wrong.

A minute later, the young man left his car too with a package in his hand as he walked straight to the office building of Shengshi. His knife was hidden in the pocket of his coat.

At this moment, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see what was in the package. Since he had a knife with him, there could be more dangerous things in the package. She hoped that she wouldn’t see explosives in it.

Luckily, there were only several stones in the package.

Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao quietly followed the young man.

The young man who disguised himself for a courier stopped at the door of the office building. It seemed that he was waiting for someone to take the package.

About three minutes later, a woman about 30 years old walked out towards him.

The man handed the package to the woman, before reaching his hand into the pocket of his coat when the woman was signing her name.

Other than Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao, no one else noticed what he was doing.

The second the young man pulled out his sharp knife, Jing Yunyao abruptly dashed out and kicked him away. The knife in his hand fell to the ground with a clear sound, which attracted attention from people around them.

The woman who was signing her name was scared and threw the package to the ground at once.

The security guards by the door also ran to the young man and captured him. Although they didn’t witness what the young man had done, they knew it was a murder attempt.

“What happened?”

“It seems that the courier wanted to stab Manager Ding, and the woman kicked the courier away at a key moment.”

“Wow, it’s unbelievable.”

After a quick kick, the young man was already three meters away from them, shocking a large group of people.

“Manager Ding, are you alright?” Someone went to ask Manager Ding with concern.

Manager Ding was still shocked and couldn’t say a word.

Right at this time, a private car stopped at the door, and three men stepped out of it. They were two young men and a middle-aged man. The middle-aged man asked with a serious expression, “What’s going on here?”

“President He!”

Once he showed up, all the staff in Shengshi greeted him with great respect.

Jing Yunyao felt that he looked familiar, but didn’t know who he was.

He Qiming also saw Jing Yunyao, and was surprised when he saw her face.

“Y-Yunyao?” He Qiming couldn’t believe his eyes.

Jing Yunyao stared at He Qiming, but didn’t know what to say.

Other people didn’t know He Qiming’s relationship with Jing Yunyao, so they remained quiet.

“You...” He Qiming walked to Jing Yunyao at once.

“President He, can we go to your office to have a private conversation?” Gu Ning stopped him right away.

Gu Ning didn’t expect to meet someone who could recognize Jing Yunyao here, but she thought that she should probably tell Leng Shaoting that she had found Jing Yunyao later.

“Oh, hi, Miss Gu.” He Qiming didn’t notice Gu Ning until now. He Qiming knew that Gu Ning was Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend, so he was very polite to her.

“Please follow me to my office,” said He Qiming.

“Sure.” Gu Ning agreed.

Afterwards, He Qiming left one of his secretaries to deal with what had happened by the door, before he walked into the office building with Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao.

Along the way, He Qiming glanced at Jing Yunyao once in a while, but he knew it wasn’t time for him to ask any questions yet.

Gu Ning said nothing and Jing Yunyao remained silent too.

They went to the president’s office later, and the secretary poured a cup of tea for Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao before he walked out. He Qiming immediately opened his mouth and asked, “Are you really Yunyao?”

He Qiming didn’t think that it was possible, because Jing Yunyao looked much younger. Besides, it seemed that she didn’t know him.

Before Jing Yunyao could say anything, Gu Ning said, “Yes, she is really Yunyao, Shaoting’s mother, but she lost her memories.”

Hearing an affirmative answer, He Qiming was excited. However, although Gu Ning was Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend, he didn’t know much about her, so he didn’t fully trust her.

“She looks much younger,” said He Qiming.

“Well, she has taken good care of her skin.” Gu Ning explained, although it was a lie.

He Qiming nodded, because it was possible for a 50-year-old woman to look like a woman in her early thirties.

“Well, I saw their bodies with my own eyes that year,” said He Qiming again.

“Didn’t the woman have a totally disfigured face?” asked Gu Ning.

“Yes.” He Qiming nodded.

He began to think that the woman who died with Leng Yunhan might not be Yunyao.
