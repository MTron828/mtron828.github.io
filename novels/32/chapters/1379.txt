Chapter 1380: Gu Ning’s Medicine

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

She knew Leng Shaoting was a very skilled soldier, but she didn’t want him to be in danger. If she didn’t see the picture, she wouldn’t mind it, but she already saw it now, so she couldn’t stay calm.

No matter who had appeared in the picture, she wouldn’t hesitate to help, especially when the person was Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning turned around and walked outside. She picked up the call on the way. “What’s up, Shaoxun?”

Although Gu Ning was very anxious about Leng Shaoting’s safety, she didn’t show it at all in her voice.

“Ningning, Leng Shaojia seems to be seriously injured, and she keeps complaining about her painful waist. They thought of your medicine and plan to ask you for it, but I think Leng Shaojia doesn’t deserve it. Can you turn them down?” Leng Shaoxun said.

Gu Ning put on a wry smile. “I can’t give it to them even if I want to right now, because I have to leave the capital as soon as possible. It’s an emergency, and I’ve gotta go now. If they call me later, I’ll talk to them.”

In fact, Gu Ning had no intention to help Leng Shaojia, even if Master Leng told her to do that. She was already being very kind that she hadn’t disabled Leng Shaojia, and there was no way that she would help her.

“Fine, be careful!” Leng Shaoxun said.

Since Gu Ning wouldn’t give Leng Shaojia her medicine, Leng Shaoxun was satisfied.

After hanging up the call with Leng Shaoxun, Gu Ning got in her car and drove it away. The picture emerged in her sight, so she knew where the place was. She didn’t know how Leng Shaoting was right now, and she was afraid that she might disturb him, so she didn’t call him.

...

In the hospital, although the Leng family knew that Gu Ning’s medicine could help Leng Shaojia, nobody called her.

When Master Leng talked with Leng Yuanjin about what had happened to Jiang Zhongyu, Jiang Shuyuan interrupted him with impatience.

“Father, tell Gu Ning to come with the medicine right now! Shaojia is being tortured by the pain.”

She sounded as if it was Gu Ning’s duty to help Leng Shaojia and Master Leng was displeased by Jiang Shuyuan’s attitude.

In fact, Gu Ning owed them nothing. On the contrary, Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia should apologize to Gu Ning. Therefore, Master Leng criticized Jiang Shuyuan.

“What? You only think of Gu Ning when you need her help? Did you forget how you’ve treated her before? Don’t you have any sense of shame? Ningning owes you nothing!”

Master Leng had sympathy for his granddaughter, but he sided with his granddaughter-in-law this time. He knew that Gu Ning would help Leng Shaojia if he opened his mouth, but Gu Ning would definitely feel uncomfortable.

Leng Yuanqian felt embarrassed. He knew that his family had treated Gu Ning badly before, and Jiang Shuyuan’s attitude was quite annoying.

Leng Shaoming wasn’t aware of what Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia had done to Gu Ning before, but he knew his mother and sister very well. Given Master Leng’s reaction, he knew it couldn’t be simple.

Leng Yuanzhen and his wife remained silent.

Leng Yuanjin frowned and started to dislike Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia.

Jiang Shuyuan, on the other hand, didn’t feel ashamed at all. She didn’t think that she had done anything wrong. “Father, Shaojia is in a lot of pain now, so we don’t need to talk about the past. We should rescue Shaojia first.”

Seeing Jiang Shuyuan’s attitude, everyone was disgusted.

“Great, call her yourself, I won’t help!” Master Leng was furious and left without delay. Leng Yuanzhen and his wife and Leng Yuanjin and her husband also left in anger.

Jiang Shuyuan wanted to say something again, but was stopped by Leng Yuanqian. “Enough! What are you doing? Is this your attitude when you need help from someone? Gu Ning doesn’t owe you.”

Leng Yuanqian disliked Gu Ning, but he had reason.

“I...” Jiang Shuyuan didn’t know what to say now.

“Mom, what have you and Shaojia done to Gu Ning before?” Leng Shaoming asked.

“It’s not a big deal. We just argued with her,” Jiang Shuyuan said.

“Just argued with her? Why did you have to argue with Gu Ning when she did nothing wrong? Father has told you not to do that a few times, but you won’t listen. You’ve annoyed Shaoting too!” Leng Yuanqian snapped at Jiang Shuyuan.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoming was surprised. If Leng Shaoting was annoyed, they must have done something unacceptable. In that case, Leng Shaoming wouldn’t support his mother and sister either. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

No matter how much they hated Gu Ning, they could simply keep a distance from her.
