Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I’m afraid I can’t help you with that.” Gu Ning wanted to help Leng Shaoxi, but she couldn’t think of a good idea.

“Fine,” Leng Shaoxi sighed.

After remaining silent for a while, Leng Shaoxi took a long breath. “Forget it. I met my good female friend before him, and I got to know him because of my good female friend. I can’t hurt her just for him. After all, I only have a good impression of him right now. It’s not enough for me to give up my friendship.”

Actually, Leng Shaoxi had already made that decision, so she seldom replied to the man’s messages these days. Even if he called her, she would quickly end it after a brief polite talk.

Gu Ning came today, so she asked her casually. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Leng Shaoxi decided to give up, so Gu Ning said nothing further about that.

Right at this moment, Leng Shaoxi’s phone rang, and the caller was her good female friend. Leng Shaoxi picked it up and didn’t bother to avoid Gu Ning.

“Shaoxi, let’s get together tonight,” said Leng Shaoxi’s friend.

“Um, I’m not free today,” said Leng Shaoxi, feeling a little uneasy. She knew she would meet the man once she went out, so she made up an excuse.

“You’re not free? What are you busy with?” asked her friend.

Leng Shaoxi gave Gu Ning a glance, then came up with an excuse at once. “My older cousin’s girlfriend is here. I need to be with her.”

“Your older cousin’s girlfriend? Shaoting or Shaoming?” asked her friend with curiosity. Although she asked that question, she believed it must be Leng Shaoming. Leng Shaoting’s character was well-known to people in high society after all.

“Shaoting,” said Leng Shaoxi.

“What? Leng Shaoting has a girlfriend? Jesus, I can’t believe my ears. What girl can win Leng Shaoting’s heart in this world?” Leng Shaoxi’s friend exclaimed. She ached to meet the mysterious girl who was able to win Leng Shaoting’s heart. “Why don’t you come with her? We can have fun together.”

“Well, I need to ask her about that. I’ll reply to you later. I’m not sure whether she’ll go. If she won’t, I won’t go either. I can’t leave her alone.” Leng Shaoxi actually wanted to turn her friend down directly, but thought it was a little impolite, so she changed her mind.

…

After hanging up, Leng Shaoxi said to Gu Ning with embarrassment, “Um, I can call her in a few minutes, telling her that Shaoting’s girlfriend is unwilling to go.”

Because she used Gu Ning as the excuse, Leng Shaoxi felt a little embarrassed.

“You can’t avoid it forever,” said Gu Ning. Although she understood why Leng Shaoxi did that, she didn’t think it was a good idea.

“You’re right, but I don’t know how to face him!” Leng Shaoxi felt she was in a dilemma, but couldn’t think of a better idea.

“If I were you, I would choose to face it and turn the admiration into friendship. Although it’s difficult, you need to bear the result after making the decision. Since you don’t want your friend to feel hurt, you can’t let her know you are giving up the man for her, or she’ll feel guilty and blame herself for that. You’re unwilling to hurt her and she has the same idea. Therefore, you can only make up an illusion that you don’t like the man instead of giving him up for her. Well, that’s just my idea. I won’t force you to do it. It’s still up to you how to handle it,” said Gu Ning.

“I agree with you. I should face it, but I can’t let my friend know that I gave him up for her. Although it’s hard to do at the beginning, it isn’t a big deal.” Leng Shaoxi thought Gu Ning’s words made sense, so she decided to take her advice. “Ningning, can you go with me tonight? To help me stay calm.”

“Sure.” Gu Ning was worried about Leng Shaoxi too, so she didn’t refuse.

After that, Leng Shaoxi replied to her friend and they went back to the living room.

Leng Yuanqian needed to deal with something today, so he wasn’t home until 6 pm.

At 6 pm, it was time for dinner.

Once Leng Shaoting and the others came, Jiang Shuyuan lost her appetite. However, she would be hungry if she didn’t eat, so she forced herself to eat a little.

After having lunch, Jiang Shuyuan went outside with the excuse that she needed to visit Leng Shaojia, because she didn’t want to see Leng Shaoting and the others.

Anyway, nobody cared where Jiang Shuyuan went.

Gu Ning and the others had a rest for a while after having lunch, then Gu Ning told them that she needed to go out with Leng Shaoxi to meet with her friends, so she wouldn’t leave with them later.

No one stopped Gu Ning from doing what she wanted to.

At 8:30 pm, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoxi left in Leng Shaoxi’s car with Gu Ning being the driver.

The place of their gathering was in a high-end clubhouse. It was about 9 pm when they arrived. Leng Shaoxi’s friend had already sent her the number of the private room.

Once they reached the clubhouse, Leng Shaoxi began to feel nervous. Luckily, she could still compose herself.

Because it was a high-end clubhouse, customers here were all from high society. Therefore, it was very easy to see familiar faces.

Shortly after they walked into the hall, Leng Shaoxi and Gu Ning saw a familiar face which was Rong Jue.

At this time, Rong Jue was alone. Although the Rong family had a bad relationship with the Leng family, they still greeted each other when they met.

“Hi, Miss Leng, Miss Gu.” Rong Jue greeted them first.

“Hi, Lord Rong!” Gu Ning and Leng Shaoxi said.

After exchanging greetings, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoxi walked away without another word.

Rong Jue said nothing either, watching Gu Ning walking away with mixed emotions.

When Gu Ning and Leng Shaoxi reached the third floor, she caught a familiar back, but couldn’t recognize it.

Before long, the person walked to a private room. Although Gu Ning only saw the side of his face, she recognized him this time. The man was the third son of the Yuan family, Yuan Wenrui.

The two men who walked into the room along with him must be his bodyguards.

Coincidentally, Gu Ning ran into Yuan Wenrui here. She wondered who was in the room right now. Therefore, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to see the inside. There were 3 men. Gu Ning had seen 2 of them, who were Shen Yanfeng and Liu, while the other one was a stranger.

Gu Ning thought they must be ready for another deal, but it wasn’t convenient for her to eavesdrop outside the room now.
