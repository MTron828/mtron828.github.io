Chapter 1963: The Dog Again?

“Well done!” said Gu Ning as she smiled. Despite the monster fox’s small form, it possessed cultivation. It was so strong that it was capable of kicking a cow to death.

Harada Honichi got kicked by the monster fox several times, and even if it did not kick him with full strength, the injuries were bad enough.

“Master, you haven’t let me out to practice for some time! I have been staying inside the telepathic eye space for so long. I can’t cultivate when I am unconscious,” said the monster fox begrudgingly. Ever since Gu Ning became its master, it was capable of absorbing even more magical power, but it did not have the chance to cultivate and improve its skills.

Gu Ning suddenly felt bad when she heard what the monster fox said. She spent most of her time on campus and Baili Zongxue was around, so she could not let the monster fox out.

Gu Ning contemplated before she decided. “I know somewhere you can go to cultivate. I will take you there when I have the time.”

Gu Ning decided to take the monster fox to the siheyuan where it could cultivate in peace. Shangguan Yang had set up a power gathering formation there, so it was perfect for cultivation.

“Okay.” The monster fox was delighted to hear this and went back into Gu Ning’s telepathic eye space.

Gu Ning did not leave right away as she heard Harada Honichi calling Zhang Chengtao. She felt Zhang Chengtao might show up at the villa or at least visit Harada Honichi at the hospital, so she decided to stay put for now.

Five minutes later, Gu Ning could hear the sound of sirens coming from behind Harada Honichi’s villa before the ambulance quickly took the injured man away.

Since Zhang Chengtao did not show his face, Gu Ning went to the hospital to wait for him. Gu Ning followed the ambulance to the hospital, but only lingered outside the door.

Zhang Chengtao arrived ten minutes later. Gu Ning did not move in on him right away. Instead, she waited for him to come back after visiting Harada Honichi. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Since she was at the hospital entrance and there was nowhere discreet for her to release the monster fox, she secretly left after Zhang Chengtao went in. She found a secluded spot without any surveillance before she released the monster fox and showed it a picture of Zhang Chengtao which she just took.

Although the photo was unclear, he was certain to be dressed in the same outfit.

…

After Harada Honichi was examined and his wounds were taken care of, Zhang Chengtao arranged for him to be sent to a VIP hospital ward.

Harada Honichi was not gravely injured, but it was bad. He suffered from a mild concussion, so he needed to stay hospitalized for a few days of observation and was unfit for travel. Hence, Harada Honichi was unable to leave for home tomorrow.

He would probably be able to manage going home if he really wanted to, but it was bound to affect his recovery.

Harada Honichi not only had a concussion; his face and body were also injured. Even though the scratches were not deep enough to cause disfigurement, he needed a long time to recover. And although he did not suffer from any internal injury, he was in agony and needed at least a week of bed rest in order to recover.

After Harada Honichi returned to his room, Zhang Chengtao finally asked when there was no one around, “How did you suddenly get hurt?”

Harada Honichi’s disciple merely said Harada Honichi was injured when he called and asked for an ambulance without going into detail about the injuries. Now was the perfect time for Zhang Chengtao to ask.

Although Harada Honichi was badly injured, he remained conscious and was able to speak.

“I was reading in the study when a dog suddenly barged in. I wanted to drive it away, but it pounced on me and scratched my face. Sadly, I was unable to catch this stupid dog. Otherwise, I would definitely slaughter it,” said Harada Honichi furiously with a murderous aura radiating from him.

“Huh? Did a dog get to the second floor?” Zhang Chengtao was surprised to hear this. Since the culprit was a dog, it was impossible to seek justice for Harada Honichi!

Harada Honichi got hurt on his property, so he could not stand by doing nothing. He immediately apologized to Harada Honichi, “I am so sorry. I didn’t know that there were vicious dogs in the vicinity. I will investigate the matter and find the dog so that I can seek revenge for you.”

“Okay.” Harada Honichi knew full well the chances of finding the dog were slim, but he acknowledged Zhang Chengtao anyway. It would be perfect if Zhang Chengtao could find the dog. Otherwise, he would not be able to get over this.

Despite his fury, he would not blame Zhang Chengtao if he failed to find the dog. After all, such things were out of Zhang Chengtao’s control. Since they were friends, he would cut him some slack!

Harada Honichi needed to rest, so Zhang Chengtao did not stay long. However, Zhang Chengtao was unaware that a threat was coming for him.

The monster fox looked at the photo and made note of Zhang Chengtao’s appearance. It recognized Zhang Chengtao the moment he walked out, so it ran towards him.

It lunged onto Zhang Chengtao just like it did with Harada Honichi and sent him falling to the ground hitting his head hard.

Just the sound of it would send chills down anyone’s back. Everyone retreated in shock.

The monster fox was too swift. By the time Zhang Chengtao realized he was attacked, it was too late.

The monster fox merely bumped into Zhang Chengtao without scratching his face or giving him a few more kicks at Gu Ning’s request. After knocking into Zhang Chengtao, the monster fox left immediately making Zhang Chengtao’s fall seem like a pure accident.

“Chairman Zhang…” Zhang Chengtao’s chauffeur was shocked to see this and immediately checked on Zhang Chengtao.

Since there were doctors nearby, they came over to check on Zhang Chengtao as well.

Zhang Chengtao was bleeding on the back of his head, so Zhang Chengtao’s chauffeur immediately got a doctor to examine Zhang Chengtao and give him treatment.

Doctors had double standards between common citizens and the rich and powerful. Zhang Chengtao clearly looked like a rich man and the doctors also heard Zhang Chengtao’s chauffeur calling him “Chairman Zhang”. Zhang Chengtao looked like someone who could take care of the hospital bill, so they did away with their usual policy and took care of him right away.

Zhang Chengtao fell on his head, so he was in a lot of pain and very dizzy.

Although Zhang Chengtao did not get a close look at the culprit, he recalled seeing a little white ball. Zhang Chengtao instinctively wondered if he was attacked by a dog.

Zhang Chengtao recalled Harada Honichi saying he hurt his head due to a dog attack. He trembled instantly and wondered if the dog did not appear by accident but by design! It was trying to get Zhang Chengtao and Harada Honichi!
