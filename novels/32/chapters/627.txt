Chapter 628 Who Chased the Other First?

There was a lot of game equipment inside, like a billiard table, KTV, mahjong, and darts so that you could have some fun with your friends after the meal.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting arrived at 5:30 pm, and their friends were already playing the games. There were four of them in all, including Xu Jinchen, Xin Bei, Xu Qinyin and Gu Anna.

“Hi, Shaoting, Gu Ning!”

The moment Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting walked in, Xu Jinchen and Xin Bei who were playing cue sports greeted them, then continued to play.

Xu Qinyin and Gu Anna were singing in the KTV room, but the music wasn’t loud, so they heard Xu Jinchen talking to Leng Shaoting.

Gu Anna was surprised that Leng Shaoting came with Gu Ning and couldn’t believe her ears. She didn’t know Gu Ning’s relationship with Leng Shaoting.

“Oh, Gu Ning is here!” Xu Qinyin was excited, and stood up walking out.

“Wait, why did Gu Ning come with Shaoting?” Gu Anna asked but Xu Qinyin was already gone, so she followed her out at once. When they came out, they saw Gu Ning standing by Leng Shaoting’s side, and he was helping her take off her backpack.

Gu Anna was shocked. Are they a couple?

“Hi, Shaoting, Gu Ning!” Xu Qinyin said to them.

Gu Anna was already struck dumb, and couldn’t say a word.

Gu Ning left Leng Shaoting alone and walked to them.

Xu Qinyin and Gu Anna pulled Gu Ning into the KTV room and Gu Anna asked her, “Gu Ning, what’s your relationship with Lord Leng?”

“He’s my boyfriend,” Gu Ning said.

“What?” Gu Anna was completely shocked now. Although she wasn’t familiar with Leng Shaoting, she had met him many times before because of her friendship with Xu Qinyin. In the beginning, Gu Anna was very attracted to Leng Shaoting’s stunning appearance and sexy body, and she had even tried to seduce him. However, he always kept a distance from her, and she was scared of his cold glances. Gu Anna used to think that Leng Shaoting probably didn’t like women. However, Xu Qinyin told her that Leng Shaoting wasn’t a gay. That being the case, Gu Anna was quite astonished that he suddenly had a girlfriend now.

Although Gu Anna had admired Leng Shaoting before, Leng Shaoting never gave her any responses, so she already gave up and even felt stressed seeing him. Therefore, she was greatly surprised, but not jealous.

“Gu Ning, you’re Lord Leng’s girlfriend! That’s so astonishing!” Gu Anna said.

Gu Ning smiled, but didn’t say anything because she understood why Gu Anna was as shocked as everyone else when they heard that Leng Shaoting had a girlfriend. However, Gu Ning was wondering about Master Leng’s reaction when he found out.

What she didn’t know was that Master Leng already knew that Leng Shaoting wasn’t single. Moreover, he was eager to meet his grandson’s girlfriend. In fact, they have already met each other, but neither of them knew.

Gu Anna blamed Xu Qinyin. “Qinyin, why didn’t you tell me that Lord Leng has a girlfriend, and his girlfriend is Gu Ning?”

“Oh, I forgot.” Xu Qinyin blinked her eyes and looked innocent.

Gu Anna let her go, then stared straight at Gu Ning. “Tell us, who chased the other first?”

“He chased me,” Gu Ning said. “Oh my god!” Gu Anna exclaimed with shock. To her surprise, Leng Shaoting, who seemed so cold and always kept a distance from women would chase a girl on his own initiative! “Does he treat you well? Do you feel bored being with him? Don’t you feel stressed in a relationship with him?” Gu Anna asked again.

“Ha-ha.” Gu Ning and Xu Qinyin laughed out loud, but both of them understood why she would ask those questions.

“Well, no matter how cold he is to others, he’s always kind and tender in front of me. I don’t feel bored at all being with him. I’m living a happier life than ever,” Gu Ning said with a smile on her face.

“Glad to hear that!” Since Gu Ning said so, Gu Anna wasn’t worried.

“Oh, Qinyin told me that you’ve established your own brand of skincare products. It’ll open tomorrow, right? I’ll go there to shop with my female friends!” Gu Anna said.

“Great!” Gu Ning said.

“I’ve told all my female friends on WeChat, and they’ll go to have a look too,” Xu Qinyin said.

“Oh, right, I should do that too,” Gu Anna said and sent messages to her female friends by WeChat as well.

“Gu Ning, why don’t we add each other as WeChat contacts?” Xu Qinyin asked Gu Ning. “Sure, why not!” Gu Ning took out her phone. “I don’t use WeChat often. You can call me if it’s an emergency.”

“No problem,” Xu Qinyin said.

“Add me too!” Gu Anna said.

Afterwards, Gu Anna, Xu Qinyin and Gu Ning added each other as WeChat contacts.

“Wow, Gu Ning, you’ve posted nothing in your moments! Anna and I have posted countless selfies or photos of food or beautiful views.” Xu Qinyin was surprised after checking Gu Ning’s WeChat moments.

“I’m not a fan of doing that,” Gu Ning said. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Gu Anna sent out many messages concerning Gu Ning’s skincare brand, and she soon had feedback. Some said that they disliked it because it wasn’t an international brand.
