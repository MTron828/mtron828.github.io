Chapter 634 Cao Wenxin Comes

There were few people who slept early now and most people were used to sleeping late, so it was very easy for them to have dark circles.

Since Leng Shaoting wouldn’t talk to Di Runa, she felt bored and walked over to see what they were doing.

The other woman removed the facial mask ten minutes later too, and more than half of the acne on her face disappeared, which was a miracle in the women’s eyes. No matter how expensive the facial masks they had used before, it took a long time to get rid of acne. However, Kouzi was different, and was able to remove most of the acne after only ten minutes! There was no reason for them not to buy it.

Although Kouzi facial masks were a little expensive for common white-collar workers, it was very effective after all. In those rich ladies’ eyes, however, this brand was very new and cheap, but they wouldn’t mind its level as long as it was effective. Therefore, more and more women bought many facial masks.

As for the woman who had removed the facial mask, a saleswoman directly helped her apply some emulsion along with face primer and BB cream. After that, the woman felt very good and bought the whole set at once which included an emulsion, face primer, BB cream, together with a facial cleanser. It cost over ten thousand yuan in all, but she didn’t lack that amount of money.

Other women also bought a whole set after witnessing its surprising effect.

Seeing that Gu Ning’s products were so popular, Di Runa was quite displeased. No matter if it was effective or not, she wouldn’t buy it, but she couldn’t stop others from doing so.

Among Gu Anna’s friends, a woman was a famous fashion blogger, and she had recorded everything before posting it on the Internet. She was used to posting good products, and wasn’t advertising for Gu Ning. Some thought that it was an ad, and she explained that it wasn’t. If her followers had doubts, they could check it in the store themselves.

Many of her followers really came to the store of Kouzi to see whether it was as effective as she said. And the result was that most people believed that it was very effective, but some still wondered whether it contained chemicals which could harm the human body.

Facing their doubts, Ning Changkai explained to them that all the products had passed the drug test, so they were safe. In that case, sales of Kouzi increased rapidly within a short time.

During the morning, basically in two hours, Kouzi already made over two hundred thousand yuan.

Medicines were much cheaper than skincare products, but Colaine pharmacy was still able to make over twenty thousand yuan during the morning

Many people were used to posting everything on their social media now, so they helped Gu Ning advertise her brands to some extent.

When it was almost 12 am, Gu Ning and the others left for lunch, and left Ning Changkai in charge of the stores.

Gu Ning invited her friends to dine together in a hotel. She also invited those females friends of Gu Anna and Xu Qinyin to join them. They, of course, wouldn’t reject the chance to dine with so many super-rich and powerful people.

Di Runa was the happiest one among them. In fact, she planned to invite them to dine together after the opening ceremony, because she didn’t want Leng Shaoting to leave.

Mrs. Xu, however, went home after shopping, and there were 13 of them left. Gu Ning booked a luxurious large private room in the Huangdeng Hotel, which could accommodate 20 people.

When they walked inside and sat around the table, Leng Shaoting pulled a chair for Gu Ning to sit down, which upset Di Runa. She wished that Leng Shaoting would do that for her. She also wanted to sit next to Leng Shaoting, but Xu Jinchen occupied the seat before her.

It wasn’t because Xu Jinchen found out that she was paying special attention to Leng Shaoting, but because it was their habit. They knew that their boss disliked sitting with women, so they would separate women from him by sitting in the middle.

Since there were so many women in the private room now, he had to be quick, in case any of them sat by Leng Shaoting. Accordingly, Xu Jinchen sat by Leng Shaoting’s right side, and Xin Bei sat next to Xu Jinchen, while Gu Anna sat by Xin Bei’s side.

Gu Ning was sitting on Leng Shaoting’s right side, and Xu Qinyin sat next to her so that the other women in the room had no chance to approach Leng Shaoting.

Not only Di Runa, but the other women who were interested in Xu Jinchen and Xin Bei also felt disappointed, but they couldn’t show it.

During the meal, Leng Shaoting kept putting food into Gu Ning’s bowl, and didn’t care how many people were staring at them. He even peeled shrimp for Gu Ning, which made others feel quite jealous. Seeing the scene, Di Runa lost her appetite.

Gu Ning didn’t feel uneasy at all, but enjoyed the meal.

“I’m so jealous of you and I can’t eat anything,” Xu Jinchen complained.

“Then put down your chopsticks,” Gu Ning said directly.

Xu Jinchen felt so hurt in his heart.

At this moment, Gu Ning’s phone rang, and the caller was Cao Wenxin.

“Ningning, I heard that you’re in the capital now. Where are you? I’m in the capital too!” Cao Wenxin was excited.

Hearing that, Gu Ning was slightly surprised, then subconsciously gave a glance at Xin Bei. She had a feeling that something was going to happen.

“I’m in the Huangdeng Hotel now,” Gu Ning said.

“Really? I’m here too! Today’s Xinyu’s birthday, and we’re having a birthday party now. Have you eaten?” Cao Wenxin asked.

“In the middle of it. Why don’t you come over? We’re in room No.888,” Gu Ning said. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Sure, I’ll be there in two minutes,” Cao Wenxin said.

“Who is it?” Xu Qinyin asked with curiosity.

“Wenxin,” Gu Ning said, then gave Xin Bei a glance.

When Xin Bei heard Cao Wenxin’s name, he stopped eating for a second, and a touch of nervousness along with happiness flashed by his eyes.

Seeing that, Gu Ning was sure that Xin Bei liked Cao Wenxin. It seemed like they could be a couple.

Gu Ning was right. Xin Bei couldn’t help but think of Cao Wenxin all the time, but he refused to admit it because they didn’t have a good first impression of each other.
