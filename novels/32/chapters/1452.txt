“Great, just listen to my instructions now to see whether it works,” Gu Ning said. “Relax and sit cross-legged.”

Leng Shaoting listened to her and sat cross-legged. Since he needed to practice his cultivation, he couldn’t use the night-luminescent pearl.

“Focus on your stomach when you take a long breath in and breathe in the air into your body till the top of your head, then let it move to your stomach,” Gu Ning said.

Leng Shaoting did everything she told him. However, it wasn’t easy to succeed in the beginning, so he needed to try many times. Luckily, Leng Shaoting had patience and knew that failure was the mother of success.

Normally, it took a person half a month to learn to absorb the magical power. Therefore, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting didn’t feel disappointed after they failed several times.

Gu Ning didn’t know what the right way to turn the power into qi was, so they just kept trying.

Leng Shaoting stayed calm and practiced again and again. He was very smart, and started to feel changes after a long while. The essence of the universe was gradually absorbed by Leng Shaoting and into his stomach.

Gu Ning’s face lit up with excitement when she saw that Leng Shaoting finally found the right way.

While Leng Shaoting had successfully absorbed the magical power into his stomach, he still needed to learn how to turn it into qi. He had to store enough magical power in his stomach, then let it circulate endlessly. During this process, the magical power would be transformed into qi.

Leng Shaoting failed several times before he could control the movement of the magical power in his body. He had to focus on it for a long time and couldn’t be disturbed, because if he couldn’t control the movement of the magical power, it wouldn’t circulate in his body.

He encountered many difficulties when he tried to control the magical power to move the way he wanted it to move, but he tried again and again until he succeeded.

Because Gu Ning was worried about him, she used her Jade Eyes to check his body. So when the magical power started to circulate in his body, she felt very happy for him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Once the magical power began to circulate in Leng Shaoting’s body, he felt comfortable and energetic. He repeated the process again and again, then felt something strange flowing in his body.

As time went by, qi came into being in his body.

Gu Ning was surprised by Leng Shaoting’s efficiency, because he was able to do it within such a short time!

At this moment, Leng Shaoting felt that he was full of strength and was much stronger than before.

Although he was able to turn the magical power into qi now, the sun appeared in the sky and the magical power became thinner in the air, so he had to stop for the day. In fact, with the help of the night-luminescent pearl, he could do it anytime as he wanted. He just needed to practice it slowly to get a better result.

“How do you feel now?” Gu Ning asked him once he stopped.

Because she couldn’t interrupt him when he was in the middle of cultivation, she had stayed quiet for a long time.

“Well, I feel like I’m full of strength now, and my sight also got better,” Leng Shaoting said.

He looked ahead to a distant place and felt like it was really amazing. Nobody knew the changes in his body better than himself.

“Wow, congratulations! You found the right way, and now you can absorb the magical power on your own to turn it into qi in your body,” Gu Ning said.

Although Gu Ning had endless magical power, she couldn’t produce it. She could only make use of it with the help of her Jade Eyes.

“I understand.” Leng Shaoting nodded. He felt excited that he could successfully turn the magical power into qi now.
