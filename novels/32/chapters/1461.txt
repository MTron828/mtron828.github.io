Chapter 1462: To See Leng Shaoting’s Parents’ Room.

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

In Master Leng’s study, Master Leng said to Leng Shaoting, “The Shen family and the Chen family were unusually quiet the rest of this year. I don’t know whether they sensed something bad for them, or if they coincidentally had nothing to do.”

The Shen family must be fully prepared, since it dared to break the law.

Although the Leng family had a group of skilled secret guards, they could do nothing if their target didn’t take any action. The Leng family had a group of secret guards to protect it and they had complete loyalty towards it. And even though there were only just over a hundred secret guards in the Leng family, they worked together like an army.

Normally, about 30 secret guards stayed in the Leng family’s old house as common security guards. Therefore, it was very difficult for bad people to intrude into the Leng family’s old house. Because of the secret guards, the members of the Leng family could stay safe at home.

It wasn’t a secret that many powerful families had a group of secret guards to protect them, because they had many enemies. In the Leng family, however, only Master Leng and Leng Shaoting were able to summon and order the secret guards to do something. Those secret guards obeyed their orders under any circumstances.

“The secret guards who are spying on them found something new today. Shen Yanfeng had a private meeting with Yuan Wenrui, the third son of the Yuan family.”

“Although they didn’t hear their conversation, it’s very strange. The Yuan family isn’t a friend, but Shen Yanfeng is one of our relatives so he should know that we don’t want to have any relationship with the Yuan family.”

“They must be scheming against us.”

Master Leng frowned and looked worried.

Leng Shaoting was also confused. He definitely knew that Shen Yanfeng and Yuan Wenrui were planning something behind their backs. Shen Yanfeng had always been ambitious and greedy.

“I think he wants what we refuse to give him from the Yuan family,” Leng Shaoting said with certainty.

Although Shen Yanfeng was the Leng family’s relative and the Leng family had helped him a lot, he wasn’t satisfied with it. The problem now was that they didn’t know the condition of Shen Yanfeng and Yuan Wenrui’s agreement.

If Shen Yanfeng really reached an agreement with Yuan Wenrui, they must be in the same party. Not every member of the four dominant families was smart and honest.

The Leng family’s direct descendants were mostly upright and outstanding, but it’s side branch was complicated. After all, there were too many members in a powerful big family.

“I think we better deal with the Shen family as soon as possible,” Master Leng said.

“I understand.” Leng Shaoting nodded.

...

Gu Ning had stayed in Leng Shaoting’s room for 20 minutes when Leng Shaoting walked upstairs.

“Shaoting, is your parents’ room the same as before? Can I have a look at it? I think we can maybe find some useful clues,” Gu Ning said once she saw Leng Shaoting.

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting looked a little sad, but he didn’t mind and agreed without hesitation. “Sure, their room is still the same, but it’s time for dinner now. We can go to their room after dinner.” They didn’t have enough time now.

“Great!” Gu Ning smiled.

After that, they went downstairs together.

About 10 minutes later, Leng Yuanzhen and the others came back home, and Leng Yuanzhen and his wife were very happy to see Gu Ning. Leng Yuanqian, on the contrary, didn’t want to see Gu Ning at all, because Gu Ning refused to give them her magical pills to cure Leng Shaojia. Leng Shaojia was his daughter after all, and he felt terrible when his daughter was being torture by the pain.

Even though Master Leng told him that Gu Ning was out of that magical pill, he didn’t believe it. However, he was unwilling to beg Gu Ning for it, because he knew that Gu Ning wouldn’t agree.

Actually, Leng Yuanqian didn’t know that Leng Shaojia had hired a professional killer to murder Gu Ning. If Gu Ning was a weak girl, she could have been killed by the killer. And it was not only Gu Ning; Master Leng and other important members of the Leng family could also have been seriously injured because of Leng Shaojia’s stupid jealousy.

Leng Yuanqian disliked Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning, but he wasn’t dumb and he knew what he couldn’t do. Therefore, he only kept his distance from them.
