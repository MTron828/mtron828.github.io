2916 Jiang Yutong Encounters Trouble

After the problem was completely solved, it was already five days later and Chu Peihan had made a full recovery, but for the time being, she didn’t go to work.

She lived her life casually and wouldn’t be busy with work all the time. She would only join a crew when she saw a good script.

However, it seemed to be a season for trouble. Right after Chu Peihan got better, Jiang Yutong got in trouble. It was Jiang Jiamin who shared the news with Gu Ning.

She said that Jiang Yutong looked creepy and had behaved very strangely these days. They argued yesterday, but Jiang Yutong suddenly grabbed her neck and tried to strangle her to death. If Jiang Yutong’s mother hadn’t seen and stopped her, she might have been killed.

Jiang Jiamin complained to Gu Ning not thinking much of it, but Gu Ning thought that Jiang Yutong might be possessed by a ghost.

Although Gu Ning had a bad relationship with Jiang Yutong, she was close to Jiang Jiamin and Jiang Minhong. Therefore, she had to do something to help them, or Jiang Yutong might hurt other members of the Jiang family.

That was her elder aunt’s family!

However, Gu Ning didn’t tell Jiang Jiamin about her idea. She decided to do it secretly.

“Oh, how are your parents now?” Gu Ning asked. She wasn’t just asking about her uncle and aunt, she wanted to know more about their condition.

She wasn’t sure what happened to Jiang Yutong yet. If something evil got into the Jiang family, all of them would be affected.

“My parents are fine, but my grandparents have been in a very bad condition recently. They went to the hospital, but didn’t find out why. They barely eat and are relying on Colaine nutritious liquid to live. I don’t think they’re well,” Jiang Jiamin said with a frown.

If that was the case, the Jiang family was probably affected by something evil.

Master Jiang and Old Mrs. Jiang were home all day long, so they were greatly affected whereas the other family members were outside most of the time, and only came back at night, so they were only slightly affected. It wasn’t long yet so they were still fine.

Although there was magical power in Colaine dietary supplement, it couldn’t protect them from being affected by evil power.

As a result, if they didn’t get rid of it quickly, they would be in great danger.

“Perhaps people get sick due to old age,” Gu Ning said.

“Perhaps!” Jiang Jiamin agreed that her grandparents were in a bad condition because they were old.

After having the call with Jiang Jiamin, Gu Ning booked a plane ticket to City B right away. She also called Jing Yunyao and told her that she was going to City B.

She didn’t share the news with the Tang family since she would make decisions according to the situation after visiting the Jiang family.

When Jiang Jiamin told Gu Ning that, it was already 5 pm, so it was nearly 9 pm after Gu Ning arrived at City B. She took a taxi to the Jiang family by the time it had become 10 pm.

It wasn’t a bad thing, because it was more convenient for Gu Ning to do what she planned to do at night.

After Gu Ning got out of the taxi, she sneaked into the block where the Jiang family lived.

Once she approached the Jiang family’s house, she sensed the evil power around it. It wasn’t strong, but it was enough to harm people’s bodies. As time went by, the Jiang family would gradually lose their strength and energy.

As soon as they lost all of their energy, they would die.

Even if they found out something was wrong, it was useless to go to the hospital. It had nothing to do with medicine so the doctors wouldn’t find the cause.

That was why Master Jiang and Old Mrs. Jiang were so weak, but didn’t know why.

Outside the Jiang family’s house.

Gu Ning hid first, then used her Jade Eyes to look at their house.

Because it was late at night, all the members of the Jiang family were home. Master Jiang and Old Mrs. Jiang already went to bed, while the other members were in their own rooms.

Gu Ning searched for Jiang Yutong without delay.

Only a dim night light was on in Jiang Yutong’s room. Sitting in front of the make-up mirror, Jiang Yutong combed her hair. With a gloomy face, she looked creepy.

If other people saw her, they might think it was a horror film.

At a glance, Gu Ning could see that Jiang Yutong was possessed by a ghost. Besides, the ghost was filled with hatred, so the house was covered in evil power.

It should have happened not long ago, or the situation would have been much worse.

Gu Ning did nothing yet. She spied on Jiang Yutong for a while to see what she was going to do.

Her instinct told her that Jiang Yutong would do something later.

She waited for a total of an hour during which Jiang Yutong sat in front of the mirror.

At 11 pm, Jiang Yutong suddnely moved. She glanced at the time, then stood up and walked to the window. The next moment, she jumped out of it.

It was dark outside, so no one saw her.

Because Jiang Yutong was possessed by a ghost, she wasn’t injured even after jumping out of the window from the third floor.

After all, ghosts could float in the air, and it wouldn’t die even if it fell to the ground.

Jiang Yutong jumped into the yard, then walked to the wall and climbed over.

Gu Ning quietly followed her to see where she was going.

Although it was easy for her to kill the ghost in Jiang Yutong’s body right now, she wanted to know the story.

Due to Gu Ning’s high level, the ghost didn’t notice her at all.

Jiang Yutong seemed to know where people could see her, so she only walked in unobtrusive places.

Gu Ning followed Jiang Yutong out of the block to another block, and stopped before a house.

This house was already deserted, so the yard was overgrown with weeds, and there was a creepy and cold atmosphere everywhere.

After all, a ghost stood here.

Standing in the yard, Jiang Yutong focused on the house for a while. Then she said, “Mom, don’t worry, I already possessed a human’s body. I’ll take revenge for us. I promise I’ll pay that man back!”

Afterwards, she turned around and walked away. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Hearing that, Gu Ning had sympathy for her. Even though it was a ghost, it did it for a reason, but she still wouldn’t allow the ghost to kill, because Jiang Yutong would be dragged into trouble and the Jiang family would also be affected.
