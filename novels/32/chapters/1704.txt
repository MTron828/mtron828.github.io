Chapter 1707: He Is a General

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“General Leng, miss, and ma’am, please follow me this way.” Cai Wenhong made a hand gesture to invite them.

After that, they followed Cai Wenhong and left.

Lin Mengya and the man already ran away in fear once they made sure that Leng Shaoting was indeed a general.

Lin Mengya just told the man to ask their old classmates in the WeChat group to see whether anyone else knew Leng Shaoting, and the man did it.

“Hey, I just ran into the cold Leng Shaoting in the museum, but I heard Curator Cai call him General Leng. Does any of you know why?”

Before long, someone replied to him.

“Really? How is it possible?”

“No way! General Leng? Only an officer with a rank of major general or above can be called that.”

“Right. Although I heard that Leng Shaoting joined the army, he’s only 26 this year. It’s impossible for him to earn such a high rank in the military!”

“Search for it on the Internet!”

“I don’t think you can find the answer on the Internet. If Leng Shaoting is really an officer with a rank of major general or above, he must belong to a special team, his information should be highly confidential, and only the senior leaders in the military can know it.”

“Why?”

“Because soldiers in the special team must do dangerous tasks. The tasks are quite dangerous and kept secret too, but they can get high rewards. Leng Shaoting must have made great achievements in order to become a major general at such an early age.”

“I can’t believe it. He’s as young as we are!”

Most people couldn’t believe it.

“Zhang Lihong, are you sure you met the right person?”

Zhang Lihong was the man’s name.

“I’m very sure of it.”

“Um, I actually saw Leng Shaoting standing with several important figures before, but I don’t know his real identity.”

“I have always had a feeling that Leng Shaoting isn’t an ordinary man.”

“I don’t know whether Leng Shaoting is a general, but I know his family isn’t ordinary at all.”

“Tell us!”

“What does his family do?”

Once they found someone who knew Leng Shaoting’s family background, they ached to know more about him.

“His family is the Leng family in the capital, and he’s the Leng family’s eldest grandson.”

“What? The Leng family is the leading family of the four dominant families in the capital!”

“No way!”

“...”

Everyone was shocked and couldn’t believe it, but no one doubted it, because the father of the classmate who told them Leng Shaoting’s family background was a senior official in the capital, so it was normal that he knew members of the Leng family.

Zhang Lihong and Lin Mengya were totally amazed now. To their astonishment, Leng Shaoting was the eldest grandson of the Leng family in the capital.

Zhang Lihong couldn’t be more regretful now. He didn’t seize the chance to please an old classmate from a super powerful family, instead he laughed at him when they met each other.

Lin Mengya also regretted giving Leng Shaoting up that year. If she could marry Leng Shaoting, she would be a lot more important than other people now.

It seemed that she believed she could get Leng Shaoting as long as she persisted in chasing him.

Actually, there were countless girls who chased Leng Shaoting and wanted to become his girlfriend. Most of them were prettier and richer than Lin Mengya, but Leng Shaoting didn’t bother to pay attention to them.

Leng Shaoting chose Gu Ning in the end, which proved that he didn’t care about his girl’s family background or her appearance. Gu Ning was very stunning, but she wasn’t the most beautiful girl who had chased Leng Shaoting. It was her special air that attracted Leng Shaoting.

In the end, they couldn’t change what had already happened. Since they already offended Leng Shaoting, they had to leave right now, and didn’t dare to see him again.

When Leng Shaoting and the others left the museum, they went to Cai Wenhong’s office.

His secretary poured cups of tea for them once they came.

“General Leng, I heard from my teacher that you can exchange the jade with an antique of the same value?” asked Cai Wenhong. Although Jiang Zhongyu already told him that, he still needed to ask about it in person.

Cai Wenhong preferred an antique to money, because he was in charge of a museum after all. They normally collected antiques by searching for them everywhere, and they were happy to exchange antiques.

“Yes,” Leng Shaoting said.

“This Jade with Dragon Phoenix Cloud Pattern is worth around thirty million yuan. What valuable antique can you give us, General Leng?” asked Cai Wenhong.

Leng Shaoting didn’t answer that question but turned to look at Gu Ning, and Gu Ning said, “I have a Tang Sancai vase which is worth about forty million yuan.”

“What? A Tang Sancai vase which is worth about forty million yuan?”

Hearing that, Cai Wenhong was surprised, not because Gu Ning had such a valuable antique, but because she was willing to exchange the vase for the jade. There was a price gap of ten million yuan after all!

“Are you sure?” Cai Wenhong asked.

“Sure,” said Gu Ning. “If it’s possible, can I take the jade away right now? I can arrange someone to send the vase here later.”

“Of course,” said Cai Wenhong. If other people wanted to do that, he might not agree, but Leng Shaoting was different.

In addition, they had to sign the contract before they took the jade away, so he wasn’t afraid that they would deny it.

In fact, Cai Wenhong was quite excited that he could get a Tang Sancai vase which was worth about forty million yuan today.

As the curator of this museum, he was in a high position with a high salary, but he didn’t have ten million yuan.

Even if an official became corrupt in the government, he couldn’t be very rich, and Cai Wenhong was an upright official. Therefore, ten million yuan was a lot of money in his eyes.

Accordingly, he was shocked that Gu Ning easily decided to exchange the vase for the jade.

Anyway, since Gu Ning was willing to do that, he wouldn’t turn her down.

After that, Leng Shaoting signed the contract with Cai Wenhong.

Because it was settled because of Leng Shaoting’s influence, he had to sign his name.

Afterwards, Leng Shaoting took the box with the Jade with Dragon Phoenix Cloud Pattern inside, then gave it to Gu Ning.

Gu Ning was full of excitement when she got it and her hands were shaking. However, it wasn’t her own feeling, instead it came from the Jade Eyes.
