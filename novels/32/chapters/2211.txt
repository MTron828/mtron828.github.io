Chapter 2214: How Did You Know Someone Would Shoot?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

On the other side of the phone, it fell into a mess because of the abrupt gunshot. Song Wenxuan was protected by his security guards at once. Because the person who secretly shot Song Wenxuan failed, he didn’t fire again and immediately ran away, or he might be caught.

The Song family members, however, were amazed by Gu Ning’s words.

“Gu Ning, w-what did you say?” Song Wencheng was the first who came back to his senses and asked.

Gu Ning didn’t reply to him and instead put the phone on speaker, then asked Song Wenxuan, “Uncle Wenxuan, how are you?”

Hearing Gu Ning’s voice, Song Wenxuan calmed down and said, “I-I’m fine. Gu Ning, thank you so much. If it hadn’t been for you, I would…” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Song Wenxuan didn’t finish, because it was a little inconvenient to talk about that right now.

He didn’t know how Gu Ning managed to know that someone would shoot him, but he knew he couldn’t mention it now, so he said, “Let’s talk about it when I’m home!”

“I’m afraid it’s a treacherous plot. I have a feeling it’s not over yet, so I’m worried about you. Uncle Wenxuan, which private room are you in right now? I’ll go to have a look,” said Gu Ning.

Even if Song Wenxuan felt it was a little inappropriate, he also knew it was a treacherous plot, he wouldn’t have come if he had a choice.

Therefore, since Gu Ning said it wasn’t over yet and he also felt it was dangerous, he didn’t turn her down.

He knew Gu Ning was a strong girl, so he felt relieved that she was here.

The Song family was sure that someone had shot at him after hearing Song Wenxuan’s reply. They were scared and began to look at Gu Ning in surprise.

How did she know someone would shoot Song Wenxuan? Did she call him to protect him? Could she foresee the future?

They didn’t think it was possible, and felt it was too unbelievable. However, what they didn’t know was that it was the truth.

“Gu Ning, how did you know someone would shoot Wenxuan? You’re with us now,” asked Song Wencheng once Gu Ning finished her call with Song Wenxuan. He was quite curious about it.

Gu Ning then explained it to them. “In fact, I came to visit you today because I received a message after I arrived at City C. Someone is going to hurt Uncle Wenxuan. So I planned to talk about that with Uncle Wenxuan, but unexpectedly, the person took action so soon. I knew because I had a premonition, so I called Uncle Wenxuan without delay. It might sound strange to you, but after I woke up from a coma caused by a car accident a year ago, the premonitions I’ve had are 80% accurate.”

Hearing the purpose of Gu Ning’s visit today, the Song family felt quite grateful to her. However, they were all astonished after hearing her explanation.

If they hadn’t witnessed it, they wouldn’t believe it, but now they had to believe it after witnessing what Gu Ning could do.

“Wow, it’s so incredible!” Song Mingzhuo looked at Gu Ning with great admiration. He took Gu Ning as his idol now.

“It’s indeed unbelievable.”

Other people chimed in. It was too unbelievable to be true.

“Alright, I think I should stop eating and go to meet Uncle Wenxuan now,” said Gu Ning, then she stood up. She was unwilling to waste time.

Although Song Wenxuan might not be in danger again, she still needed to go there as quickly as possible in case any accidents happened.

Fortunately, she was in City C now, or Song Wenxuan might have been injured.

At least it meant Song Wenxuan had good luck!

“Thank you so much, Gu Ning,” said Leng Yuanjin. She looked anxious and worried.

She knew Gu Ning was strong, but Gu Ning was just a girl, so Leng Yuanjin couldn’t help but feel worried. She was worried about Song Wenxuan and Gu Ning. However, no matter how worried she was, she could do nothing now and could only rely on Gu Ning.

“Do you need some people to go with you?” said Master Song. He was afraid Gu Ning might not be able to handle it alone if anything bad happened.

“No need. It’ll be inconvenient if there are too many people. Don’t worry, I promise Uncle Wenxuan will be fine with my help,” said Gu Ning with great confidence.

Since she said that, the others said nothing further. They didn’t dare to waste Gu Ning’s time either, because Song Wenxuan was still in a very dangerous situation. Therefore, they watched Gu Ning walk away.

Once Gu Ning left, she called K and gave him the address of the restaurant that Song Wenxuan was dining at. She told K to watch the surveillance cameras to see whether he could find the criminal.

She wouldn’t let the criminal get away with it.

The person didn’t succeed this time, but his actions already broke the law and he might try again.

Song Wenxuan was in a complete panic after the accident happened, although he did his best to calm down.

At the same time, he also pondered who wanted to kill him.

Although he didn’t have an exact name, he knew there were several people who wanted to kill him at this time. As for the purpose, he easily figured it out without an investigation. They did it for the position of the secretary of the provincial party committee.

After the accident happened, Song Wenxuan walked into the hall of the hotel, but he didn’t rush upstairs because he had already called the police. He needed to wait till the police came and he would leave after giving his account.

Because Song Wenxuan was the deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, the police came very quickly. The director of the Public Security Bureau came in person.

After hearing the whole story, the director of the Public Security Bureau carried out an investigation at once.

Although the director of the Public Security Bureau wasn’t in the same faction as Song Wenxuan, he didn’t dare to take it lightly. After all, he wasn’t in the same faction as Song Wenxuan, but he could still be in trouble if Song Wenxuan had anything on him.

Those who went to the same meal with Song Wenxuan were nearly all present before he showed up. Therefore, they soon learned the news after it happened, and they all asked Song Wenxuan about the situation with concern.

When Song Wenxuan thanked them for their concern, he also carefully observed their expressions. He was suspicious that the mastermind might be one of them. However, they all had been involved in politics for years and they knew how to hide their emotions, so Song Wenxuan saw nothing from their faces.

In fact, the mastermind was indeed among them.
