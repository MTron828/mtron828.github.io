Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Seeing Gu Ning asked out by Zhang Qiuhua, everyone was looking at her. Some were puzzled, and some gloated, especially Shao Feifei and her friends. Shao Feifei believed the head teacher was going to blame Gu Ning for her yesterday’s absence.

Only Gu Ning stayed calm, and she knew the real intention of her head teacher.

“Gu Ning...”

Yu Mixi called her with worry.

“It’s fine.” Gu Ning gave her a glance to comfort her.

“Professor Zhang, nice to see you again,” Gu Ning greeted Zhang Qiuhua politely.

“Gu Ning, your mother told me that you were in a car accident, and needed a surgery. How could you be alright all of a sudden?” Zhang Qiuhua asked with doubt. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The day before yesterday, Gu Man had just called Zhang Qiuhua and told her Gu Ning had been caught by a car accident, but Gu Ning showed up as usual in school today, everyone would ask what had actually happened.

Gu Ning understood that, so she explained, “I did have a car accident. My brain has been damaged and I fell into unconsciousness. The doctor said there was blood congestion in my brain and must be cleaned out by surgery. However, I woke up the next day, and the blood congestion was gone. So I’m fine now.”

Zhang Qiuhua thought it was so unbelievable, but she didn’t ask further. Miracles could happen.

“I’m glad you’re fine, but you need to take care of yourself. If you feel uncomfortable, just let me know. Now, you can go back.” Zhang Qiuhua said. She cared about her student, especially she just had recovered from a car accident.

“Thank you so much,” Gu Ning thanked her teacher, then went back to classroom.

The minute Gu Ning was back, everyone’s sight fell on her again. They all wanted to know whether Zhang Qiuhua had criticized her.

However, Gu Ning looked the same as usual. Nothing was different.

Shao Feifei and her friends felt upset. Hadn’t Zhang Qiuhua criticized Gu Ning?

Or, Gu Ning was merely pretending that everything was fine.

Exactly, she must be pretending. Zhang Qiuhua must had strongly criticized her!

But Shao Feifei still felt uncomfortable to see that Gu Ning didn’t wear a sad face.

“Gu Ning, are you alright?” Yu Mixi asked immediately when Gu Ning sat down.

“I’m fine,” Gu Ning smiled.

Yu Mixi was relieved seeing Gu Ning was really fine. She continued to read when Zhang Qiuhua walked in.

After a while, Yu Mixi finally realized that Gu Ning was different, but she didn’t know where and why.

Gu Ning, on the other side, focused on her books. She read and flipped fast, bearing the context in her mind.

Shao Feifei paid her attention to Gu Ning once in a while. She saw how fast Gu Ning read a book. “Look at Gu Ning, she’s so good in pretending. How could she read a word by flipping so fast! And she even pretends to be a good student.” Shao Feifei said to Yang Yulu.

“Exactly, she’s pretending to be a good student.” Yang Yulu agreed.

Shao Feifei intended to cause trouble when the class was over.

“Yulu, Qingya, let me tell you something.” Shao Feifei called Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya, but her voice was loud enough to let everyone in the classroom hear it clearly.

Everyone instantly knew what was going to happen next, and they have all their ears on them.

“Please tell us!” Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya cooperated actively.

“I met somebody, who’s too poor to afford a meal in a jewelry store yesterday. She was disliked because she didn’t have much money. And she even said the jewelry of another person were fake. Wasn’t she being so jealous of the rich?” Shao Feifei talked to Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya, while watching at Gu Ning all the time. It was apparent that the “somebody” in her story was precisely Gu Ning.

No one doubted Shao Feifei, but looked over at Gu Ning with disdain.

Though many of them weren’t from a rich family, they lived a much better life than Gu Ning. Moreover, none of them dared to walk in a jewelry store, which was the rich people’s place.

“Of course she was jealous of the rich.” Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya responded in a perfect accord.

Yu Mixi glanced at Gu Ning with worry. She knew Gu Ning was not like that, and was mad at the other’s behavior.

Especially Shao Feifei and her friends, they were all bullies.

Wasn’t a jewelry store open to anyone? Who said the poor couldn’t walk in a jewelry store? And why did someone has to buy something once he or she walked in a jewelry store?

But Yu Mixi was too weak to argue back. She only kept the anger to herself.

“Well, I think somebody does have a good appearance. If she can’t buy it on her own, she can find herself a sugar daddy. As long as her sugar daddy is pleased, she’s able to buy one then.” Shao Feifei added.

Hearing this, everyone stared at Gu Ning in a strange way, like she had already found herself a sugar daddy.

Even Gu Ning herself was displeased now. She threw a cold look at Shao Feifei. The latter felt threatened at once.

But a few seconds later, Shao Feifei felt she had been humiliated, and was annoyed. She yelled at Gu Ning, “What do you think you are? I’m not talking about you. If you’re willing to admit, be my guest!”

“Oh, have I admitted that you’re talking about me? I’m just curious why do you keep looking at me while you’re telling the story? Do you have a crush on me? Sorry to tell you, I only like boys.” Gu Ning wore a serious face while she was joking.

“Ha-ha.”

“Ha-ha, Ha-ha.”

Everyone laughed out loud, which made Shao Feifei feel embarrassed. She hit the desk with a snap sound, shouting at Gu Ning, “Gu Ning, shut your mouth! You’re literally shameless! I don’t like you. If you dare to say it again, I’ll tear you mouth apart!”

While saying this, Shao Feifei seemed she was ready to fight.

“Gu Ning, you’re a shameless girl, and stay away from Feifei!” Yang Yulu helped Shao Feifei, and glared at Gu Ning.

“Exactly, Gu Ning, how could you be so shameless!” Wu Qingya followed up with an evil face.

“Gu Ning...” Yu Mixi called her with concern, trying to stop her from standing up against Shao Feifei.

But before she could say it, Gu Ning stopped her by a glance.

Gu Ning knew Yu Mixi was worried about her, but she was different now. She wasn’t scared of Shao Feifei any longer.

And she wanted to deal with her issues by herself.
