Chapter 2823: Do You Miss My Body?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Because Li Mingzhang was slightly frightened by He Qihang’s words, he had an absent look on his face. Seeing that, Mrs. Li asked with concern, “What’s wrong?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Mom, Mingyue should be awake now. She told He Qihang that I pushed her on purpose. He Qihang just called me and shouted that he was going to pay me back.” Li Mingzhang didn’t know what he should do. “Mom, what if He Qihang asks Gu Ning to cause me trouble?”

Knowing that Li Mingyue was awake now, Mrs. Li was happy, but she was also a little upset when Li Mingzhang said that He Qihang decided to pay him back.

However, she was mad upon thinking that Li Mingzhang deliberately pushed Li Mingyue, so she criticized him. “You shouldn’t have pushed Mingyue! Couldn’t you talk to her nicely? Why did you have to use violence? Didn’t you know that she was pregnant? If it hadn’t been for Miss Gu, Mingyue could have lost life! Now she has survived, but she lost her baby. It’s understandable for them to blame you. Don’t you feel guilty at all?”

“I was a little impulsive, but Mingyue is fine now. They can have more babies if they want. He Qihang punched me today. I think that’s enough!” Li Mingzhang argued. Even though he felt slightly guilty, he didn’t think it was so serious.

“You…” Mrs. Li was angered. “That was a life! Mingyue was pregnant for seven months and the baby already had a shape. How could you be so cold-blooded?”

“It already happened. What can I do? The most important thing right now is to stop He Qihang from blaming me,” said Li Mingzhang. He didn’t regret it at all.

Mrs. Li was mad, but Li Mingzhang was her son, so she didn’t want him to be in trouble. She also hoped that He Qihang and Li Mingyue would stop blaming Li Mingzhang for that. They would pay the costs while Li Mingyue was in the hospital.

“If you want them to stop blaming you for that, mind your attitude. Go visit Mingyue tomorrow morning with some gifts and you should pay all the medical fees,” said Mrs. Li.

“Mingyue just had an operation and she needs to stay in the hospital for a while. That will be a lot of money!” Li Mingzhang was reluctant to pay the medical fee, because it would add up to at least a few hundred thousand yuan.

Mrs. Li was furious. “Do you think you don’t need to pay for injuring other people? If you don’t listen to me, just wait till He Qihang pays you back. If you anger them, you could be put in jail after they call the police. Don’t think Mingyue will forgive you just because you’re her older brother. You caused her to lose her baby and almost her life. I don’t think Mingyue still sees you as family. She won’t care about your life either.”

As their mother, Mrs. Li knew that Li Mingyue didn’t get along with Li Mingzhang. If she hadn’t paid some attention to Li Mingyue, Li Mingyue would probably have left them earlier on, but compared with her sons, she still valued her daughter less.

Nevertheless, she believed that Li Mingzhang should pay the compensation this time.

“I…” Mrs. Li made it very clear, so Li Mingzhang didn’t know what to say. He had to accept it.

…

An hour after Gu Ning returned to the siheyuan, Leng Shaoting got back.

Gu Ning knew that Leng Shaoting was coming back, so she went to wait for him at the gate. Master Leng and Jing Yunyao even joked about that, but they understood that Gu Ning missed Leng Shaoting very much.

In fact, Jing Yunyao had the same feeling. She also wanted to wait for Leng Shaoting outside, but they were a young couple. They might want to kiss and hug each other once they met again, so she didn’t go out.

When Leng Shaoting finally got back, Gu Ning met his eyes and knew that both of them had missed the other badly.

“You’re back!” said Gu Ning with excitement.

“Yeah, I’m back!” said Leng Shaoting. Then he immediately walked to Gu Ning and gave her a big hug. Gu Ning hugged him tightly as well. They smelt each other and felt greatly satisfied.

They wanted more, but it wasn’t the right time.

“Did you miss me?” asked Leng Shaoting.

“Of course, I missed you every moment. I could barely eat and sleep,” said Gu Ning seriously. Although it was exaggerated, she indeed missed him deeply.

“Did you miss my body?” Leng Shaoting asked with an evil smile.

Gu Ning immediately flushed and pushed him away. She left his arms and gave him a glare. “Stop flirting with me. I was just worried about your safety.”

Gu Ning was honestly worried about Leng Shaoting’s safety, but she couldn’t help thinking of his body when he brought it up.

“I know. If I’m injured, you can’t have a taste of my body.” Leng Shaoting joked.

“You…” Gu Ning was mad and didn’t want to talk to him any longer. The next moment, she turned around wanting to leave, but Leng Shaoting stopped her by catching her hand.

“Alright, let’s deal with business first. After it’s done, we can do whatever we want,” said Leng Shaoting to comfort Gu Ning.

“Stay away!” Gu Ning wanted to get rid of his hand, but Leng Shaoting clasped her hand.

“Alright, we’re so close now. You don’t need to be so shy,” said Leng Shaoting. He was still joking.

Gu Ning suddenly squinted and observed Leng Shaoting.

“What?” Leng Shaoting met Gu Ning’s eyes.

“If I didn’t feel the air of a cultivator from your body and you didn’t look so familiar, I might doubt whether you’re really Leng Shaoting,” said Gu Ning. She couldn’t stand it when Leng Shaoting wouldn’t stop flirting with her.

“I am your man!” Leng Shaoting felt amused. He joked with Gu Ning once more.

“Who knows!” Gu Ning rolled her eyes.

“Oh, was it dangerous this time?” asked Gu Ning. Although Leng Shaoting was home safely and the process wasn’t important, Gu Ning still wanted to know more about it.

“No, but it’s related to the vampires in Country M. However, they’ve all been killed now,” said Leng Shaoting.

Knowing that, Gu Ning was relieved.

Leng Shaoting held Gu Ning’s hand and walked into the living room. He didn’t feel embarrassed even though Shangguan Yang, Jing Yunyao, and the others were present.
