3250 Did They Quarrel?

Once Mu Yiyang was done, he called Li Mochen and asked him whether he wanted to have some night snacks.

Li Mochen didn’t agree at once, first asking Leng Xiaoyao. If Leng Xiaoyao wanted to go, he would go. If not, he wouldn’t bother to go out.

Leng Xiaoyao agreed. Whether or not she really wanted to go, she didn’t want Li Mochen to turn Mu Yiyang down because of her.

After that, Li Mochen called Mu Yuan and Meng Fan and asked them to go with.

Mu Yiyang and the others were aware that the credit should go to Leng Xiaoyao, so they admired her more than ever.

That night, both Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen didn’t fall asleep till it was late. They couldn’t help thinking of the hug they had shared today and the thing Leng Xiaoyao said that they shouldn’t have done.

Even though neither of them had an impression of it, they could imagine it.

Upon thinking of that, they flushed and their hearts pounded.

After they fell asleep, they each had a dream. Leng Xiaoyao dreamed about returning to Alpha Planet and reuniting with Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. She was very happy. At the same time, she was also upset because she missed Li Mochen.

She didn’t know why she missed Li Mochen so badly. There was nothing between them!

Li Mochen also dreamed about Leng Xiaoyao going back. He felt like he lost something and couldn’t go back to normal.

He didn’t know why Leng Xiaoyao had such an impact on him.

As a result, they were both slightly upset the next day and Mu Yiyang noticed it.

“You two look strange today. Did you quarrel?” asked Mu Yiyang.

Hearing that, both Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen were struck dumb for a second. Leng Xiaoyao said resignedly, “We didn’t quarrel! We’re just thinking about what happened yesterday.”

“Fine!” Thinking of what had happened yesterday, Mu Yiyang was in a bad mood too.

However, Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t thinking of the same thing as Mu Yiyang. Anyway, she wouldn’t tell. In fact, she purposely did it to make Mu Yiyang misunderstand.

Li Mochen had booked plane tickets yesterday, so after having night snacks, Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen left.

Because both of them were worried, they barely talked along the way and the atmosphere was a little depressing.

Before long, the depressing atmosphere went away because they met someone Li Mochen knew at the terminal of the airport. It even caused a drama.

“Oh, is this Mr. Li, the heir of the Li family? No, you don’t have a relationship with the Li family any longer. You’ve been abandoned by them.”

It was a man, who was about twenty-four years old. He was dressed completely in famous brands and looked like an arrogant playboy. Looking at Li Mochen, he was full of disdain.

In the past they would bully Li Mochen, but now it was impossible for them to do that.

There was no way.

There were two other men with Zheng Haoding. They were Feng Yiyan and Wei Nanxi. Both of them were rich heirs and had a good relationship with Li Xiaoyang.

Feng Yiyan clearly sided with Li Xiaoyang like Zheng Haoding, but Wei Nanxi didn’t.

Wei Nanxi just joined their circle. He didn’t know much about the Li family and Li Xiaoyang’s relationship with Li Mochen. Therefore, he held no bias against Li Mochen.

At the same time, he disagreed with Zheng Haoding’s mockery towards Li Mochen. However, he didn’t know the reason for their behavior, so he said nothing.

“Sure enough. Without the Li family, he’s nobody.” Feng Yiyan chimed in mocking Li Mochen. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“But I heard he has a relationship with many important figures,” Zheng Haoding said disdainfully. He didn’t attach much importance to Li Mochen just because of that.

He didn’t know what important figures Li Mochen had a relationship with, but he didn’t think that they were comparable to the Li family. Therefore, it wasn’t a big deal.

“Important figures? I’m scared, ha-ha, ha-ha!” Feng Yiyan acted scared, then laughed loudly.

“Zheng, Feng, I think you should stop!” Wei Nanxi couldn’t stand it any more. He opened his mouth and expressed his disagreement.

“Why? We should also hate whoever Xiaoyang doesn’t like,” Zheng Haoding said nonchalantly.

Li Mochen ignored their mockery and didn’t bother to reply, but Leng Xiaoyao was angry.

“Brother Mochen, who is Xiaoyang?” asked Leng Xiaoyao. She already had a guess about it. If she guessed correctly, he should be Li Mochen’s cousin.

Zheng Haoding and the others didn’t notice Leng Xiaoyao until they heard her voice. Afterwards, they were stunned by her beauty.

Especially Zheng Haoding, he could hardly take his eyes off of Leng Xiaoyao. He only paid attention to Li Mochen earlier, so he ignored the girl next to him. Unexpectedly, the girl was stunning.

He had seen all kinds of pretty girls before, but none of them could amaze him so quickly.

Zheng Haoding was clearly attracted to Leng Xiaoyao.

Seeing Zheng Haoding’s reaction, Li Mochen was annoyed. He even wanted to beat Zheng Haoding. However, his reason stopped him.

“He’s the son of my father’s younger brother.” He answered Leng Xiaoyao’s question.

He didn’t admit that he was a member of the Li family and that Li Xiaoyang was his cousin, but he couldn’t deny the fact that his father was a member of the Li family and Li Xiaoyang’s father was his father’s brother.

After verifying who Li Xiaoyang was, Leng Xiaoyao hated him and his friends even more.

“Miss, may I know your name? My name is Zheng Haoding, I am the heir of the Zheng family in the capital city. Have you heard of the Zheng family? My family is one of the richest families in the capital city.” Zheng Haoding suddenly tried to arouse Leng Xiaoyao’s interest.

“Really?” asked Leng Xiaoyao, showing interest.

Seeing that, Zheng Haoding disdained her. It turned out that all women were the same. They all loved money.

Nevertheless, Zheng Haoding had a lot of interest in Leng Xiaoyao because she was gorgeous.

He never took it seriously and would marry a woman chosen by his family. He didn’t care who the woman was as long as she didn’t stop him from playing around outside.
