Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The hospital? Leng Shaoting frowned a little. He was puzzled why she was going to the hospital, but he didn’t ask at all. He said to the man on the driver’s directly, “Drive the car.”

“What? Oh, right!” The man was apparently absent-minded. He got his mind back immediately when he heard Leng Shaoting’s voice. He drove the car ahead quickly.

There were many questions in the man’s mind. He kept peeking at Leng Shaoting who was sitting beside, then peeked at Gu Ning from the rearview mirror.

This female student was good-looking though, but she was too young. She couldn’t be Leng Shaoting’s type.

“Focus on driving,” Leng Shaoting said coldly. The man was frightened, then paid his attention on the road. He was still confused about the relationship between the female student and Leng Shaoting. However, he didn’t have the nerve to ask.

Right at that moment, Gu Ning’s phone rang. She picked it up. Before she could say anything, she heard Mu Ke’s worried voice, “Boss, whose car did you get in? Are you safe?”

When Mu Ke and others followed up, they saw Gu Ning get in a black Maserati.

They were all shocked because they knew the car was so expensive. The owner must be the rich or the authorities.

Although Gu Ning got in the car must be because she knew the driver, Mu Ke decided to call her to make sure she was safe.

“I’m fine. You all can go back to the school now,” Gu Ning replied.

“No, we want to visit your mother as well. We’ll see you in the hospital.” Mu Ke hung up directly before Gu Ning could respond, in case Gu Ning wouldn’t allow them to come.

Gu Ning knew they were being kind, thus she agreed.

Both Leng Shaoting and the man had good hearing. Although they had no intention to eavesdrop, they were able to hear the talk clearly. Both now understood the reason why Gu Ning was in a hurry.

“May I help?” Leng Shaoting suddenly opened his mouth. The man on the driver’s seat turned the steering wheel in horror. He almost hit the car before them. Luckily, he was a skillful driver and didn’t cause an accident.

But it wasn’t his fault though. Leng Shaoting, who was always cold, opened his mouth to offer a help out of the blue, which was totally frightening to him.

Leng Shaoting glared at the man. The man immediately paid his attention back to the road. He was also hoping Leng Shaoting wouldn’t say more to frighten him. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Gu Ning didn’t care though. Facing Leng Shaoting’s kindness, she rejected with politeness, “Thank you so much. I can handle it myself.”

Since Gu Ning wanted to deal with it on her own, Leng Shaoting stopped asking. He wasn’t a warm-hearted person. He helped her only because she had helped him.

But Leng Shaoting wasn’t aware Gu Ning simply had made a deal with him. He didn’t owe her anything.

At the same time, the video of Gu Ning vs. Hao Ran and his friends went viral on their school’s forum.

Ever since Hao Ran had challenged Gu Ning, there were many students paid close attention to it.

The news that Gu Ning had accepted Hao Ran’s challenge, and the appointed time along with place were all revealed on the forum last night. Many said they would go to watch the fight at 1 pm.

But unexpectedly, the fight had ended before 1 pm.

Everyone was shocked by the result too.

80% of the students didn’t believe Gu Ning could win, while 10% abstained, and the rest 10% believed in Gu Ning. They thought Gu Ning was really powerful on the video in the canteen, and she was very confident.

Not everyone would take confidence as arrogance.

The result was Gu Ning had won. Gu Ning really had won the fight within several minutes, which was a shocking news!

“What the f*ck, who said it was 1 pm at the football field. How come it ended so soon?”

“Exactly, I lost the chance to watch it in person. Who leaked the appointed time and place? Come out, we promise we won’t beat you to death.”

“Yes! Come out and explain to us.”

“Come out!”

Meanwhile, the guy who had leaked the appointed time and place last night was now in sadness as well, because he hadn’t watched the fight in person neither.

He was also mad.

“This is so unbelievable! Gu Ning alone won Hao Ran and his another two bros? Who can tell me whether it’s true?”

“It must be something wrong with my computer. I need to restart it.”

...

“I now an admirer of Gu Ning. She’s so cool, isn’t she?”

“She is! She beat Zhang Tianping down to the ground by one move. It’s so amazing!”

“And her flip is so cool too.”

...

Some admired Gu Ning while some doubted.

“Did Hao Ran and his friends use their full strength? I still can’t believe Gu Ning a girl alone and win them.”

“Exactly! I doubt it too.”

...

The minute doubts appeared, those admirers of Gu Ning started to retort.

“Are you all blind? I was there in person. I saw it with my eyes. They did fight with full strength! If you don’t believe, you can have a fight with Gu Ning herself, then you’ll know.”

“Exactly, not everyone is able to do flip in the air.”

“Gu Ning now is the boss of Hao Ran and his friends. If you dare to question Gu Ning, you are questioning Hao Ran and his friends. Be careful about that! Shao Feifei was almost hit by Hao Ran when she questioned the result on site.”

Knowing that, those who had doubts were all quiet now. They were scared of Hao Ran and his friends.

“I think I’m going to tell my goddess that I like her. Wish me good luck!”

“Wish you good luck. Hope you can survive.”

“Wish you good luck. Actually I want to see a drama.”

“Wish you good luck. Waiting for the result.”

“Wish you good luck...”

Although they were wishing the student good luck, they all actually wanted to see a drama.

As for Gu Ning, she couldn’t care less about those discussions.

It took half an hour to get to the hospital normally, but the man drove there steadily within 20 minutes.

Gu Ning thanked Leng Shaoting, then left the car. She immediately ran to the outpatient department.

The Maserati stayed at the same place instead. Leng Shaoting and the man watched Gu Ning leaving.

“Shaoting, who is this female student? I never saw you help anyone on your own initiative,” the man couldn’t help but ask at the end. He felt extremely uncomfortable to keep it to himself.

“Let’s go,” Leng Shaoting ignored the man’s question.
