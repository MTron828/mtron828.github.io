3003 In the Dream

Because Ling Tianqi had already heard that Leng Xiaoyao suddenly became excellent at studying, he wasn’t shocked by their conversation. He had already been surprised before today.

After seeing Leng Xiaoyao’s skills at car racing and fighting, he wouldn’t be shocked again no matter what she did in the future. He would be amazed, but he wouldn’t think it was not true.

…

When Leng Xiaoyao got home, it was nearly 9 pm.

Because they didn’t have an evening class on Sunday night, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t go home early that night. She had told Leng Changyuan earlier that she would visit her classmate’s home for a meal .

In the past, Leng Xiaoyao never listened to Leng Changyuan, so Leng Changyuan could hardly restrict her behavior, but now Leng Xiaoyao changed and become obedient, so he believed that she could protect herself.

When Leng Xiaoyao got home, Leng Changyuan pulled her to the side. “Xiaoyao, tell grandpa how you became so excellent?”

“In fact, I just found out that I have a very good comprehension. If you want to know more, I don’t know either,” Leng Xiaoyao explained.

“Oh!” Leng Changyuan was disappointed. He had hoped to hear some details, but Leng Xiaoyao told him that she also didn’t know.

“Perhaps I’ve always had potential. I just didn’t know because I paid too much attention to Chu Jianan. So after I lost interest in him, I began to fulfill my potential,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Leng Changyuan agreed with her. “It seems that Chu Jianan has wasted much of your time and energy. Luckily, it’s not too late to get rid of him.”

Once they brought up Chu Jianan, Leng Changyuan felt disgusted.

Late at night, Leng Xiaoyao remembered her parents, younger brother, relatives, and friends in the other time space.

Upon thinking that they would be heart-broken after she disappeared, she was very sad.

If it was possible, she wished she could tell them in a dream that she wasn’t dead. She was fine and simply traveled in time back to her previous incarnation to repay what she owed.

Perhaps Leng Xiaoyao was so devoted to the idea, after she fell asleep, she indeed dreamed of returning to the time space where she came from. She went back to the Leng family’s house and saw her parents, younger brother, grandmother and great-grandfather.

All of them were sad. The moment Leng Xiaoyao saw them, she burst into tears. Without delay, she ran towards them and shouted, “Dad, mom, grandma, grand grandpa, Xiaoran!”

Hearing Leng Xiaoyao’s voice, the five of them turned to look at her. As soon as they saw her, they cheered up. Gu Ning stood up and hugged her tightly.

“Yaoyao, you’re back? Oh, I’m so glad that you’re fine.” Gu Ning was excited, because she finally saw her daughter who had disappeared for a long time.

“Yaoyao!”

Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao ran to Leng Xiaoyao at once too. They were both extremely excited and happy.

Leng Xiaoran, however, shouted angrily, “Leng Xiaoyao, you’re finally back! Do you know how heart-broken we were for the past couple of days?”

The angrier he was and the louder he shouted, the more worried and sad he was.

Only when he was worried and sad would he be so emotional.

“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have worried you. It’s my fault.” Leng Xiaoyao blamed herself for that. Actually, she clearly knew she didn’t really go back. It was just a dream.

Even though it was just a dream, Leng Xiaoyao still said to them, “Dad, mom, grandma, Xiaoran, I’m not really home. This is a dream. I failed to pass the test, and traveled in time back to where I lived previously. I need to repay what I owe to be able to come back to you. Please don’t be worried about me, don’t be sad or heart-broken. I’m living well now. After a few years, I’ll come back home.”

After Leng Xiaoyao finished, she felt her consciousness being drawn out of her body. The next moment, she abruptly opened her eyes in bed and woke up from the dream.

She remembered the dream. Although it was just a dream, She still hoped that she had really gotten into her family’s dreams and told them everything.

After waking up from the dream, Leng Xiaoyao couldn’t sleep any longer. With eyes wide open, she looked as the sky turned bright.

When Leng Xiaoyao woke up from her dream, Leng Shaoting, Gu Ning, Jing Yunyao, and Leng Xiaoran experienced the same thing.

They had the same dream and dreamed that Leng Xiaoyao was back. To be specific, they dreamed that Leng Xiaoyao talked to them in their dream. She told them that she wasn’t dead and simply traveled in time back to her previous incarnation.

It was a dream, but it was so real. They felt it might not be so simple. It was possible that Leng Xiaoyao wanted to tell them about her situation through the dream.

After Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting woke up from their dream at the same time, Gu Ning talked with Leng Shaoting about it. Leng Shaoting told her that he had the same dream.

Leng Xiaoran and Jing Yunyao couldn’t sleep either. They got up and walked out, then went to see Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning.

Outside Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning’s room, Leng Xiaoran met Jing Yunyao. “Grandma, are you…” Leng Xiaoran asked.

“I need to see your parents,” Jing Yunyao said. Afterwards, she knocked on the door of Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning’s room. She didn’t care whether it would wake them up.

Actually, when Jing Yunyao reached the door, she sensed that Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were already awake. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Shortly after Jing Yunyao and Leng Xiaoran arrived, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning sensed them. Therefore, as soon as Jing Yunyao knocked on the door, they opened it.

“Mom, Xiaoran,” Leng Shaoting said.

“Shaoting, I just dreamed of Yaoyao. She told me that she isn’t dead and traveled back in time to her previous incarnation. She needs to repay what she owes and she’ll be home in a few years. I don’t think it’s just a dream. It must be a message from Yaoyao,” Jing Yunyao said.

“I had the same dream!” Leng Xiaoran got excited.

Knowing that Jing Yunyao and Leng Xiaoran had the same dream, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were sure that it couldn’t be simple. As they made sure of it, they became happier.

“Ningning and I had the same dream. It can’t be so simple. Yaoyao must have wanted to send us a message through our dreams,” Leng Shaoting said.
