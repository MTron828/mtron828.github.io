Chapter 1515: Lord Long

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Zhao Binxu agreed to work for Gu Ning to return her favor. Gu Ning had saved his life after all, so he definitely wouldn’t betray her. Gu Ning would also pay him for his work so that his family could live a decent life.

Zhao Binxu wasn’t worried about his salary.

“I have the intention to hire you, but it still depends on you whether you can do the job well. I hate dirty tricks, so you must be honest and upright.”

“Even if we’re going to compete against our business enemies, we shouldn’t break the law and common moral standards. You can settle your debts once I successfully help you get your money back, so you don’t need to work for me for free. I’ll pay you according to your performance,” Gu Ning said.

Zhao Binxu was grateful to her, but she wouldn’t take advantage of him.

“Miss Gu, I...” Zhao Binxu was touched and didn’t know what to say now. At this moment, he was willing to do anything for Gu Ning. However, he felt it was too good to be true.

“If you’re willing to work for me, it’ll be best. If not, I won’t force you to. Once you become one of my subordinates, you should listen to my orders,” Gu Ning said.

“Miss Gu, of course I’m willing to work for you, and I won’t disappoint you,” Zhao Binxu said at once.

“Great.” Gu Ning nodded.

On their way, Zhao Jinghan kept glancing at Gu Ning with admiration and curiosity. She always dreamed to see her Goddess Gu one day, but she was surprised that her dream became reality because of her father. In that case, she could have a closer relationship with Gu Ning.

Zhao Jinghan felt nervous in front of Gu Ning, because she was Gu Ning’s fan. Gu Ning was her idol and she looked up to her.

Gu Ning felt Zhao Jinghan’s admiring gaze, but she didn’t give her any response.

Zhao Jinghan was simply glancing at her, but didn’t ask her anything. Although Zhao Jinghan wanted to talk with Gu Ning, she didn’t have courage.

When they arrived at the Huangdeng Hotel, Gu Ning directly took out her Black Card so that everything would be free for them.

Zhao Binxu was surprised once he saw the Black Card. If Gu Ning had a Black Card of the Huangdeng Hotel, it meant that she had an unusual relationship with the Tang family.

It was shocking news to him. He only knew that she had many companies under her name, but knew nothing about her family background.

Actually, Zhao Binxu planned to pay the bill later, but it seemed unnecessary now. Since Gu Ning had a Black Card, they could have a free meal.

The receptionist showed great respect to them and led them the way to a private room. However, Zhao Binxu saw a familiar face halfway.

It was a young man who was in his late twenties, and he behaved like a hoodlum. “Oh, isn’t this Mr. Zhao? What a surprise that you can afford a meal in such a luxurious hotel now!”

Hearing that, Zhao Binxu showed embarrassment on his face and felt displeased too.

“Hi, Lord Long,” he greeted the man.

“Hey, tell me, how can you afford a meal here?” Lord Long was unwilling to let Zhao Binxu pass.

Zhao Binxu was annoyed. “Lord Long, even though I’m not rich now, I can still afford a meal in a five-star hotel.”

Although Gu Ning already settled the bill with her Black Card, it didn’t mean that he couldn’t afford a meal in a five-star hotel by himself.

The waiter tried to mediate between them, but was stopped by Gu Ning, because she wanted to see what Lord Long wanted to do.

Zhao Binxu’s attitude annoyed Lord Long as well.

“Mind your attitude! It’s your honor that I’m willing to talk to you now. Don’t forget your manners, or you’ll lose your tiny little restaurant.” Lord Long was quite arrogant and aggressive.

“You...” Zhao Binxu was angry, but didn’t know what to say.

At this moment, Gu Ning opened her mouth. “Try it if you want.” Gu Ning didn’t know Lord Long’s influence in this city, but she wasn’t afraid of him at all.

Hearing Gu Ning’s voice, Lord Long turned to look at her and his eyes lit up the second he saw her extraordinary appearance.

“What’s your name?” Lord Long leered at Gu Ning.
