Chapter 2400: Whether He’s Good Doesn’t Matter

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Of course!” Han Chenglin normally disliked taking photos with strangers, but it was Chu Peihan’s friend, so he was more than willing to do it now. It wouldn’t do him any harm if he could form a good relationship with her friends.

“I want photos too!” said Zhang Tianping. Although he didn’t want to show it off, it was a rare chance to see a big star, so he wanted to keep the memory by having some photos.

“And me!” Su Anya joined them at once.

Seeing that they were so excited to see Han Chenglin, Chu Peihan rolled her eyes. He wasn’t very famous. Did they have to be so happy?

She was working in the entertainment industry now, and she was going to play an important role in a show!

That night, they enjoyed themselves very much, but they didn’t drink too much, because it wouldn’t be as fun if they got drunk. They usually stopped drinking when they felt that they had had enough.

They also usually didn’t stay out too late and would separate at about 11 pm. Therefore, when it was 11 pm, they separated.

Because they had known that they would drink, they didn’t drive and directly took a taxi back home.

Han Chenglin had told his assistant to come to pick them up, so he would send Chu Peihan and Su Anya home. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Mu Ke would send Yu Mixi home, and Hao Ran and Zhang Tianping were both strong men, so they could protect themselves and took a taxi home.

Han Chenglin’s assistant didn’t know that he went out to see Chu Peihan until now. If so, Han Chenglin must have come to City F for Chu Peihan!

It seemed that there was chemistry between them.

Han Chenglin’s assistant recognized Chu Peihan because of the rumors about them not too long ago. He used to think that they were just friends and it was a misunderstanding, but now it turned out that he was wrong.

He didn’t know that Han Chenglin went out to see Chu Peihan before he came to pick them up because he wasn’t aware that Chu Peihan lived in City F.

“Nice to see you, Miss Chu.” The assistant greeted Chu Peihan. Because she might become Han Chenglin’s girlfriend, he had to be nice to her.

“Do you know me?” Chu Peihan was surprised that Han Chenglin’s assistant recognized her. In fact, she didn’t know that he was Han Chenglin’s assistant.

“Yeah, I learned about you when you had those rumors with Chenglin,” said the assistant. At the same time, he carefully gave Han Chenglin a glance. He wanted to see whether Han Chenglin would get mad when he talked about the rumors.

Han Chenglin didn’t seem mad at all. Instead, there was a vague smile on his face.

Upon hearing the rumors, Chu Peihan felt a little uneasy. She was unhappy about it, because whenever she was with Han Chenglin, there was always trouble.

“Rumors? What rumors? Why is there a rumor about you? Are you…” Su Anya got interested at once and wanted to hear more gossip.

When rumors about Han Chenglin and Chu Peihan went viral, only a few of them had read the news.

Because it didn’t cause a sensation and Chu Peihan didn’t talk about that stuff with them, they weren’t aware of it.

Chu Peihan understood what Su Anya wanted to hear, so she angrily knocked Su Anya’s forehead with her knuckle. “Stop asking about it. There is nothing between him and me. It was just a misunderstanding.”

“Ouch!” Su Anya shouted in pain. It actually wasn’t very painful, but she deliberately shouted loudly. “Don’t you know that women love gossip? Why are you so eager to deny it? Did you panic?”

“I denied it because it’s not true,” said Chu Peihan in annoyance.

“I didn’t know that! That’s why I asked you about it,” said Su Anya. She wasn’t fully convinced by Chu Peihan’s explanation.

She didn’t know the truth, but she could feel that there was something different between Chu Peihan and Han Chenglin.

At this moment, some passers-by turned to look at them, so Chu Peihan directly pulled Su Anya into the car, in case any rumors were caused again.

“Get in now!” Chu Peihan shouted at Han Chenglin when she saw that he still stood outside.

Han Chenglin gave her a smile, then walked to sit in the front passenger’s seat.

His assistant was the driver.

After the car started, Su Anya whispered in Chu Peihan’s ear. “Hey, is there really nothing between you two?”

Her voice wasn’t loud, but Han Chenglin could still hear it. However, he pretended that he heard nothing.

Chu Peihan gave Su Anya a glare. “Nothing!”

“Come on, he’s so handsome and he’s a star. Why didn’t you do something? Doesn’t he like you?” Su Anya asked.

Chu Peihan was angered and shouted, “How could you say that to my face? Why do you think he is the one that doesn’t like me? I have no interest in him!”

“Um, Miss Chu, Chenglin is a quality man…” Han Chenglin’s assistant defended him. Although he wasn’t clear about Chu Peihan’s family background, he knew that Han Chenglin’s family was very rich.

In fact, even if Chu Peihan’s family was the richest in City F, it wasn’t comparable to Han Chenglin’s family.

He didn’t say that to scold Chu Peihan, but he wanted to let her know that Han Chenglin was a good choice.

“It’s none of your business. Focus on driving,” said Han Chenglin. He understood that Chu Peihan was just mad and didn’t mean to attack him. He also knew that his assistant misunderstood Chu Peihan, so he stopped the assistant.

“Fine.” The assistant felt a little aggrieved, but he said nothing further since Han Chenglin didn’t care about it. After all, it had nothing to do with him, and he was just an outsider.

“It doesn’t matter whether he’s good or not. It’s just my feelings. Do you understand?” Chu Peihan replied to Han Chenglin’s assistant.

Han Chenglin’s assistant nodded, because it was the truth.

Different women had different preferences. Some preferred money, some preferred a good-looking face, while some wanted love. When a woman didn’t lack money and was good looking, she undoubtedly wanted love.

Han Chenglin was a little upset, because it meant Chu Peihan had no special feelings for him now.

Nevermind, he had time and patience.

“But…” Su Anya still wanted to ask about something, but Chu Peihan glared at her again. “If you dare to say another word, I’ll gag your mouth.”

Su Anya felt aggrieved and pouted, but stopped asking, because she knew that Chu Peihan meant what she said.

Could she fight with her? It was impossible for her to win, so she had to give in.
