3060 Don’t Be Deceived!

Li Mochen wasn’t thin-skinned, but he felt a bit nervous when Leng Xiaoyao seriously agreed with him.

After that, Li Mochen drove Leng Xiaoyao home.

When Leng Xiaoyao got out of the car, she said, “Brother Mochen, if you don’t mind, can I invite you to have a meal together?”

“Why not!” Li Mochen agreed. Gradually, he was convinced that Leng Xiaoyao indeed had no bad intention to hurt him.

!!

Whether she had bad intentions or not, he needed to spend time with her to find out. There was no reason for him to turn Leng Xiaoyao down.

After Leng Xiaoyao left, Li Mochen didn’t leave right away. He watched Leng Xiaoyao disappear from his sight, then went to meet his friends.

When Leng Xiaoyao got out of Li Mochen’s car, Song Meiyu saw them. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Although Li Mochen’s Maybach was damaged in an accident, the car he was driving right now was also expensive. Therefore, Song Meiyu instantly got jealous.

When did Leng Xiaoyao have a relationship with such a rich man?

The Leng family was rich and had luxury cars, but they were only worth slightly more than a million yuan. Their cars were hardly comparable to Li Mochen’s car. As a result, it proved that there was a gap between their status.

Even if Leng Yuqi climbed up the social ladder on Chu Jianan’s coattails and the Chu family could afford luxury cars of ten million yuan, she still didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to have a relationship with richer people.

She couldn’t allow Leng Xiaoyao to live a better life than them.

“Xiaoyao, who’s that?” Song Meiyu asked.

Seeing Song Meiyu’s expression, Leng Xiaoyao knew what she was thinking, so Leng Xiaoyao decided to anger her more. “My friend!”

“Your friend? What friend? A man or a woman?” Song Meiyu asked urgently. She didn’t want the car owner to be a rich young man. It would be best if the car owner was an old married man. In that case, Leng Xiaoyao would be a shame.

“A man. He’s young, handsome, and rich. He’s much better than Chu Jianan,” Leng Xiaoyao said, showing affection for Li Mochen.

Song Meiyu got even more jealous.

A young, handsome, and rich man? A man who was much better than Chu Jianan?

Looking at Leng Xiaoyao’s face, Song Meiyu didn’t think the man would choose her, so she felt better.

Even Chu Jianan abandoned her. It was impossible that a man who was better than Chu Jianan would like her.

Besides, it might not be true that the man was really young, handsome, and rich.

Even though Song Meiyu didn’t think it was possible, she was still curious about it. “Oh, is he chasing you?”

“Not really. We just met, but he said he appreciates my abilities. In his eyes, I’m different from other girls. I’m very special and attractive to him,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Song Meiyu was nervous. How could she forget that Leng Xiaoyao had outstanding abilities even though she was ugly! It was possible that someone might be impressed by her skills.

Thinking of that, Song Meiyu had a premonition. Was the man impressed by Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities? Didn’t he care about her appearance?

No, she wouldn’t allow it to happen.

Therefore, Song Meiyu acted kind and said to Leng Xiaoyao, “Xiaoyao, I really respect you, but the truth is that men all like beautiful women nowadays. Don’t be deceived!”

Leng Xiaoyao smiled and said, “Some men like beautiful idiots, while some prefer smart girls. And, I don’t think I’m ugly. There are just some freckles on my face. Medicine is so advanced nowadays. I can easily remove them with a little money. Even if they can’t be removed, I can cover them with make-up. Aunt Meiyu, you’re also a woman. You should know that, right? With make-up, there is no such thing as an ugly woman. My mother is so pretty and my father is also very handsome. I can’t be ugly! After all, I was born in the Leng family. There is no reason for me alone to be ugly.”

Song Meiyu didn’t realize that until now. She totally ignored Leng Xiaoyao’s delicate features and the effect of make-up because of the freckles.

It was true that Leng Xiaoyao’s parents were both attractive. It was impossible that Leng Xiaoyao was ugly.

In addition, when Leng Xiaoyao didn’t have freckles on her face, she was actually prettier than Leng Yuqi.

Song Meiyu became anxious.

If Leng Xiaoyao removed the freckles or put on make-up, Leng Yuqi would be totally overshadowed!

Now Leng Xiaoyao was already better than Leng Yuqi at studying and fighting. If she was prettier than Leng Yuqi as well, Chu Jianan might change his mind when he saw her again.

Song Meiyu refused to think further about that. It was the last thing she wanted to see.

As a result, she had to stop Leng Xiaoyao from becoming beautiful. She must do something about it.

When Song Meiyu came back to her senses, Leng Xiaoyao was already gone. Leng Xiaoyao walked away once she finished speaking.

The moment Leng Xiaoyao entered the house, Leng Changyuan said, “Yaoyao, come here. Do you know who the person you rescued yesterday is?”

“Sure, the new secretary of the City Chang Municipal Party Committee,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Since Leng Changyuan asked her about that, he must be aware of the man’s title.

It was true that Leng Changyuan heard Lu Changwei was rescued from the explosion yesterday afternoon.

Not only Leng Changyuan, but the whole Leng family learned about that. Therefore, both Leng Yehua and Song Meiyu lost their balance. If Leng Xiaoyao formed a close relationship with Lu Changwei, they would be left behind!

Even though it would do the Leng family good if Leng Xiaoyao could successfully form a close relationship with Lu Changwei, they didn’t want Leng Xiaoyao to be the one who made that happen.

In that case, Leng Xiaoyao would become more and more powerful.

“In the afternoon, Secretary Lu called me in person. He is very grateful to you. After he recovers, he’ll visit us and thank you in person,” Leng Changyuan said.

Leng Changyuan heard the news from Lu Changwei.

When Lu Changwei woke up, he needed to learn about the situation.

After watching the video of Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen rescuing people, he was astonished. He couldn’t believe a young man and a girl saved his life.

Because Li Mochen was a man, Lu Changwei wasn’t too surprised, but he was totally amazed by Leng Xiaoyao, who was a girl.
