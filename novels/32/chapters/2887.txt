“Why can’t I find my love when I’m eager to have a girlfriend, while someone who said she had no interest in a romantic relationship quickly got a boyfriend and even made it public. It’s so strange!” Qin Yixun said meaningfully, staring at Chu Peihan.

Chu Peihan was a little embarrassed, then she argued. “It’s destiny that brought us together. I can’t say no to it. Anyway, you’ve studied in your university for three years. Couldn’t you find a girl you like?”

“No, I didn’t meet anyone I’m interested in,” Hao Ran said.

“I have many people who are pursuing me, but I don’t want to be in a romantic relationship right now,” Qin Yixun added.

“Do you have to mention that you have a lot of admirers since you have no interest in them? Are you afraid we’ll laugh at you because no one likes you?” Su Anya rolled her eyes and said disdainfully. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She hit the point and Qin Yixun was embarrassed.

“Ha-ha, ha-ha!”

Everyone laughed, and Chu Peihan immediately joked, “Qin Yixun, when did you begin to care so much about your face? You don’t need to do that when you’re with us.”

“Why? I don’t want to be embarrassed even though I’m with you. I have my pride, and I told the truth.” Qin Yixun argued.

“You’re right. You’re handsome and were born in a rich family. You surely have a lot of admirers, but people nowadays are very smart. A marriage between families of equal social status is very common. You can’t make a mistake!” Su Anya said realistically.

During the three years in university, they ran into many realistic problems. It was hard to find pure love.

“How about you, An Yi, and Tianping? Do you have a girlfriend, or are you still single?” Mu Ke asked.

“I have no interest,” An Yi replied.

“I had a girlfriend last year, and I planned to tell you after we were in a stable relationship, but she disliked my family background. After all, I’m an orphan and I was born in the countryside.” Zhang Tianping shrugged. Anyway, it had been a year, and he already got over it.

“See? People are realistic today, but it’s her loss that she broke up with you. You have tens of millions of yuan now,” Su Anya said.

Although it wasn’t much, Zhang Tianping was richer than ordinary people.

Currently they owned more than just one bar. Early last year, they opened a club. Because of Gu Ning, the club soon became popular.

Within a year, they earned the cost and began to profit afterwards.

“Right, Tianping has a car and a house which is worth over ten million yuan. At his age, it’s rare to see such a successful young man. Even I can’t do that,” Mu Ke said, but there was no jealousy in his tone.

Although Mu Ke’s jewelry store expanded smoothly and became profitable, it wasn’t a famous brand, so he wouldn’t make more money than the game industry.

“Don’t say that. You’re very successful too, and you also have tens of millions of yuan now,” Hao Ran said.

“You all have your own career and are so successful. I feel like I’m a little useless,” An Yi said with slight embarrassment.

“Come on, you have your task to carry out. And yours is much more difficult than ours. If you can’t succeed, you’ll disappoint our boss,” said Hao Ran.

Hao Ran was totally different now. He used to be a hoodlum, and it was impossible for him to comfort other people. Now he was mature and considerate.

“Right, I’ll do my best. I can’t disappoint Ningning,” said An Yi seriously. He understood that his job was tough, but he was prepared.

He went to work at Shenghua Real Estate as an intern every vacation, and he had learnt a lot about the business and development of the company, but it was barely enough. He still needed to put his knowledge into practice in order to take over the company.

After that, Song Miaoge, Baili Zongxue, and Zhang Zikai arrived and waited for Gu Ning together.

It was still very early as it was only 8:30 am. The Civil Affairs Bureau wouldn’t open till 9 am.

However, because they were familiar with each other, they chatted casually.

…

It was troublesome to marry a soldier. They needed to apply for it and pass the background investigation. Luckily, Leng Shaoting was a leader in the military, so he could make it happen on his own.

They only needed to take their household registration booklets to get the marriage certificate.

The address on Gu Ning’s household registration booklet was that of Century City, and she carried her household registration booklet with her all the time.

While Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to get the marriage certificate, Jing Yunyao, Gu Man, Tang Jiayu, and Master Tang stayed in the Leng family’s house with Master Leng.

Because Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting came a few minutes before the Civil Affairs Bureau opened, they were the first couple.

It wasn’t a special day today, so there weren’t many couples waiting in the line.

The staff thought they all came for a marriage certificate, but unexpectedly many of them were just the couple’s friends.

It was the first time that they had seen such a scene. Normally, the couple would come alone, or with their parents.

In addition, they were more surprised to see Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

It filled them with great excitement. After finishing the formalities, the staff asked them whether they could take photos together. With their agreement, they took several photos.

The staff also asked Gu Ning whether they could post the photos on their WeChat moment, and she agreed.

After Gu Ning and the others were gone, several employees posted the photos on their WeChat moments and Weibo, which aroused a lot of envy.

Gu Ning and her friends left the Civil Affairs Bureau and headed to Xiaoyao Mountain Villa. Master Leng and the others would come a bit later.

With the marriage certificate finally in hand, Leng Shaoting was excited and extremely happy.

He had waited for today for so long!
