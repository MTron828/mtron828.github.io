Chapter 1806: Do You Want a Fight?

Gu Ning, however, was different, because they were only friends. Nobody would say anything negative about them even if she helped Tang Qingyang.

After having the meal, it was 8 pm. Tang Qingyang and his friends adjourned to Song Nan’s bar while Gu Ning had to go back to her school.

The situation Tang Qingyang was in right now was still dangerous to some extent. He dared to hang out because Ba Tianyang was by his side.

Ba Tianyang wouldn’t go back to Gu Ning’s company until Tang Qingyang was in a safe, steady position.

Qiao Ya arrived at the restaurant at 7:30 pm, and was waiting in the hall. Because she had already eaten, Gu Ning didn’t invite her to join them.

Qiao Ya was going to drive her back to the school, so Gu Ning didn’t bother to use her magical power to remove the effect of alcohol. She would do that when she separated from Qiao Ya later.

Gu Ning didn’t drink much, so she only had a slight smell of alcohol.

Because the campus was in a different district from the city center, it was still a little far. What was worse was that there was a lot of traffic, so they spent an hour and twenty minutes on the road. When they arrived outside the campus, it was nearly 9:30 pm.

There were still students walking in and out, because the Capital University wouldn’t shut its gate until 10:30 pm. It was an hour away, so Gu Ning wasn’t late getting back to school at this time.

Although the Capital University had strict rules, students of other grades hadn’t come yet while freshmen didn’t get their student’s identity card yet either, so it allowed people to come and go as they liked for the time being.

Because Song Miaoge had an argument with Gao Shiyan yesterday, they refused to talk with each other now. Neither of them had a good impression of one another, so it didn’t matter.

Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao still didn’t know who Gu Ning was right now.

Gu Ning had gained a lot of fame in the economics department today, but Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao were in other departments. They hadn’t heard anyone talking about Gu Ning, so they knew nothing about her.

When it was about 10 pm, the fourth roommate was still absent, and Gao Shiyan became unkind again. “Look at what time it is now! Someone is still absent. It’s hard for us not to think about it.”

Gao Shiyan didn’t point out Gu Ning’s name, but it couldn’t be more obvious.

“Right!” Lu Xiaoxiao chimed in.

Hearing that, Song Miaoge couldn’t stand it, but she learned from Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao to be unfriendly, “Well, some people just won’t stop acting. They’re too free to focus on themselves. Those who love thinking about other people’s private life must be living an abnormal life, but not everyone in the world lives the same life!”

“What did you say?” Gao Shiyan was mad. She knew Song Miaoge was talking about her.

“I didn’t say your name. Why are you mad all of a sudden? You’re making the connection by yourself. Don’t blame me for that,” said Song Miaoge with disgust.

“You...” Gao Shiyan was angry. “You said that right after me. I know you’re talking about me.”

“Then you were talking about Gu Ning, right?” asked Song Miaoge.

“So what? I’m not talking about you. How dare you judge me?” Gao Shiyan almost went crazy.

“I just love doing that! So? Do you want a fight?” Song Miaoge challenged her.

“You...” Gao Shiyan lost courage in an instant. She definitely couldn’t win the fight against Song Miaoge and felt quite aggrieved and really angry.

Song Miaoge understood it wasn’t her business, but she hated it when Gao Shiyan began to badmouth Gu Ning. If Gao Shiyan defamed other people, she might not say anything.

Right when Gao Shiyan was about to say something again, Gu Ning reached the door of their dorm room. She was able to hear their argument and learned that her other roommates were badmouthing her behind her back while Song Miaoge was actively defending her.

Gu Ning was slightly moved, because they just met each other, but Song Miaoge wouldn’t hesitate to defend her.

The door of their dorm room was closed, but it wasn’t locked because not everyone was back.

Gu Ning took the key and opened it.

Hearing the sound, the other girls knew that Gu Ning was back.

Because Gao Shiyan was badmouthing Gu Ning just now, she panicked a little when Gu Ning came back at this moment. She felt she was caught by her. However, she didn’t think Gu Ning heard them. Therefore, after panicking for a second, she got back to normal and arrogant.

She thought that Gu Ning was just a girl, not a dangerous beast anyway.

Gao Shiyan would never give up her pride. She ignored Song Miaoge for the time being, because she forgot the fighting skills Song Miaoge had shown her.

Besides, she had no idea that Gu Ning was even stronger than Song Miaoge.

The second the door was opened, Song Miaoge raised her head and greeted Gu Ning with excitement. “Hi, Gu Ning!”

“Hi!” Gu Ning said.

As soon as Gao Shiyan and Lu Xiaoxiao saw Gu Ning, they were stunned. To their surprise, their last roommate was so beautiful.

They had to admit that Gu Ning was quite pretty.

However, precisely because of that, they were jealous of her after being stunned by her outstanding appearance. Lu Xiaoxiao hid her jealousy, but Gao Shiyan showed it on her face.

Gu Ning didn’t say hello to Gao Shiyan or Lu Xiaoxiao, because they had bad-mouthed her even before she showed up. At this time, they looked at her with jealousy and hatred, which meant it was impossible for them to be friends. As a result, Gu Ning gave up being nice to them.

She wouldn’t punish them for what they had said about her behind her back, but she wouldn’t tolerate it if it happened again.

Gu Ning closed the door and went straight back to her bed.

They used loft beds with a closet and desk at the bottom, so they actually had their own separate space.

The roommates wouldn’t affect each other.

The whole dorm room was quite large.

This was a luxurious dormitory, which was different from general dormitories. Not only was it large, it was furnished with the best

furniture. Its fee was also very high. Nevertheless, as the student who was specially accepted by the Capital University, Gu Ning got everything for free.
