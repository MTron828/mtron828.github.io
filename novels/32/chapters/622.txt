Chapter 624 Protect Yourself Well

Leng Shaoting missed Gu Ning so much that he was unwilling to wait a second longer to see her. The next second, Leng Shaoting strode upstairs and clasped Gu Ning in his arms.

“Ningning, I missed you so-so much!” Leng Shaoting said by her ear, and she felt aroused by his warm breath.

Gu Ning reached out her arms to hug his neck and looked at him with affection. “Shaoting, I missed you too!”

“How much?” Leng Shaoting asked, and he started to breathe fast.

“More than you could imagine...” Gu Ning said, and directly kissed his lips.

They kissed wildly along the way to the bedroom, and then undressed each other within seconds.

Right when Leng Shaoting pressed on Gu Ning against the bed, she suddenly noticed the injury on his chest, and was shocked.

She remembered clearly that she had never seen this injury before. Although its color became much lighter and it looked like an old injury, Gu Ning knew that it was new. Without saying anything, Gu Ning cried while staring at the injury on Leng Shaoting’s chest. Her heart ached heavily for him.

Seeing that, Leng Shaoting knew that he couldn’t hide it anymore.

“Ningning, don’t cry. I’m fine now. Don’t worry...” he said to comfort her at once.

It was the first time that Gu Ning had cried in front of Leng Shaoting, and he literally had no idea what he should do now, he just wiped the tears off her face.

Gu Ning still said nothing, because she knew that Leng Shaoting’s job was dangerous and it was unavoidable to have some injuries. That was the reason why she had given Leng Shaoting bottles of power crystals. However, she still couldn’t accept the fact that he was badly injured.

Gu Ning couldn’t imagine the result if she hadn’t prepared power crystals for him or he had run out of the power crystals. Besides, the injury was right on his chest! It must have been a very dangerous injury. If he had been shot in the heart, he could have died, no matter how many power crystals he had taken.

The effect of the power crystals was barely comparable to her power. If Leng Shaoting was really in mortal danger, she could only save his life by directly putting her power into his body.

“Ningning.” Leng Shaoting was more anxious because Gu Ning remained silent, but cried the entire time. He knew that Gu Ning felt heartbroken seeing the injury on his chest so he held her tightly to make her believe that he was fine now.

He also felt guilty that Gu Ning cried for him. He didn’t want to be injured either, but he was just a human being. If it was possible, he didn’t want to be injured at all in a war or fierce gun fight, so that Gu Ning wouldn’t be worried. He felt sad too, when Gu Ning was sad.

Gu Ning stopped crying a while later, and raised her hand to touch Leng Shaoting’s injury secretly putting her power into his body.

Although Leng Shaoting was fine after taking the power crystals, Gu Ning still wanted his injury to heal as soon as possible. However, Gu Ning just healed the inside of the injury and left its surface the same in order to not arouse Leng Shaoting’s suspicion.

Since it already happened, Gu Ning didn’t want to say much, but reminded him to be careful the next time. “You must protect yourself well the next time.”

“I will. I promise,” Leng Shaoting said.

Even so, Gu Ning still felt sad in her heart, because both of them knew that it was a lie. As long as he was a soldier in the special forces, he was living with danger.

The next morning, Jiang Ruiqin got up to run at 6 am in order to “encounter” Gu Ning. In case Tang Qingyang would interrupt them, he even forbade Tang Qingyang to appear with him.

Unfortunately, he didn’t see Gu Ning during the whole morning, which disappointed him.

He wanted to call Gu Ning, but was afraid that he would disturb her. Most importantly, they just met each other, and weren’t familiar, so he felt shy to call her now.

Jiang Ruiqin had never been afraid of anything before, but it all changed after he met Gu Ning.

Since Gu Ning was absent, Jiang Ruiqin didn’t run for long and soon went home.

“What happened? You seem so upset,” Tang Qingyang asked Jiang Ruiqin, although he already had the answer.

“Nothing,” Jiang Ruiqin lied.

“Fine.” Since Jiang Ruiqin wasn’t willing to say it, Tang Qingyang wouldn’t ask further.

Leng Shaoting hadn’t had a good rest for a long time because of his task, so he had a long deep sleep. He didn’t wake up until 9 am, and Gu Ning was still in her sweet dreams.

He fixed his eyes which were full of love on Gu Ning, and felt like he had regained a priceless treasure.

Gu Ning woke up a while later, and felt a little uneasy when Leng Shaoting stared straight at her.

“Um, I’m a little hungry,” Gu Ning said.

“Are you? Let me help.” Leng Shaoting wore an evil smile and pressed on Gu Ning.

“Hey!” Gu Ning pushed him away. “I want food, not you.” Why were men always thinking about sex?

Leng Shaoting stopped flirting with Gu Ning, and said with love in his voice, “Sleep for a while longer, and I’ll go cook for you.”

Gu Ning indeed needed more rest now, because she was so exhausted after the wild sex last night.

Leng Shaoting got up at once, and took a shower before he went to go grocery shopping. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

When Gu Ning woke up again, it was already 11:30 am, and Leng Shaoting had almost finished cooking too.

Gu Ning left the bed and took a shower. When she walked out the dishes were already on the table.

“Come on. Have a seat,” Leng Shaoting said to her.
