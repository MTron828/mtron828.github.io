1162 For Your Own Good

“What? Did I say anything wrong? She hasn’t married into our family yet, and she already dares to criticize me!” Zhou Mingkang’s mother said.

“Mom, don’t say that.” Zhou Mingkang tried to stop his mother. He was displeased because of his mother’s words, and he didn’t want his girlfriend to dump him right before their wedding.

Zhou Mingkang thought that it was nothing personal, and it was obviously his parents’ fault.

“You don’t need to worry about that, because I’m not going to marry into your family!” Li Fei said with determination and struggled to get rid of Zhou Mingkang’s hand.

“Feifei, don’t.” Zhou Mingkang held Li Fei’s hand tight.

“Mingkang, let her go. You can find someone better than her!” Zhou Mingkang’s mother said with arrogance. In her eyes, Li Fei didn’t deserve her son.

“Mom!” Zhou Mingkang was mad. He didn’t understand why his mother became so unreasonable all of a sudden. Actually, it only proved that Zhou Mingkang didn’t know his parents well.

The truth was that Zhou Zhenghong had helped his parents a lot before, so Zhou Mingkang wasn’t aware of how greedy his parents were.

Once Zhou Zhenghong lost everything, his parents kept a distance from Zhou Zhenghong. And when Zhou Zhenghong got rich again, their parents finally showed their real colors.

Zhou Mingkang knew nothing about what his parents had done before, or he would feel utterly embarrassed.

“Enough, let her go! We don’t welcome her here,” Zhou Zhengtang said in anger. He was in a terrible mood now, and Li Fei’s attitude irritated him.

“Dad!” Zhou Mingkang felt helpless.

“Zhou Mingkang, let me go!” Li Fei was furious.

“Mingkang, let her go!” Zhou Zhengtang and his wife gave an order.

“I’ll go with you, and we can have a talk in private,” Zhou Mingkang said. He knew that they couldn’t stay at his home any longer.

However, his mother stopped him. “You should stay, and let her go. If you dare to leave with her, you’re forbidden from coming back again.”

“Mom!” Zhou Mingkang raised his voice.

“Mingkang, stay home today, and don’t go anywhere,” Zhou Zhengtang said and pulled Zhou Mingkang over with great force.

“Dad.” Zhou Mingkang almost had a breakdown at this time. He even blamed himself for going back home today. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Li Fei seized this chance and got rid of his hand, then left without turning around at all.

Zhou Mingkang could only watch her leaving.

“Mom, dad, how could you ask my uncle for a house and a car? Feifei didn’t ask for that, and my uncle already bought this apartment for us. He’s very nice to us,” Zhou Mingkang said when Li Fei was gone.

Hearing that, Zhou Zhengtang shouted, “He’s my younger brother and he has enough money to buy an apartment for me.”

Zhou Mingkang thought that it was ridiculous. It wasn’t a younger brother’s duty to support his older brother even if he was rich.

However, his father took it for granted.

Zhou Mingkang didn’t know what to say, because his father was too old to change his way of thinking.

“We want a house for your own good. Don’t you know the housing price is incredibly high right now? We can’t afford a house ourselves.” Zhou Mingkang’s mother argued.

Although they had an apartment, they still wanted a house.

“Enough! Why don’t you simply admit that you’re greedy? Do you think your behavior is reasonable? It’s amoral. I don’t want my colleagues or friends to know I have such parents. They’ll despise me!” Zhou Mingkang lost his temper.

He didn’t want his parents’ behavior to affect his job. He could tolerate his parents, but other people wouldn’t.

Zhou Zhengtang and his wife closed their mouths at once, because they knew how powerful rumors were.

Actually, Zhou Mingkang’s mother loved gossiping, and she always talked about other people’s private lives with her friends.

If other people knew what they had done, their family’s reputation would be damaged. What was worse, it would affect her son’s career in the public institution as well. Therefore, Zhou Mingkang’s mother stopped arguing.

Zhou Mingkang was full of anger. Since Zhou Zhengtang forbade him to leave home, he could only lock himself in his room and called Li Fei at once, but Li Fei refused to answer his calls.

Zhou Mingkang had to give up calling in the end, then threw his phone on his bed. Because his bed was soft, his phone wasn’t damaged at all.
