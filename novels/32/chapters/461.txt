Chapter 462 Leng Shaoxun VS. Leng Shaojia

“Hey, are you going to stay inside forever?”

Cao Wenxin then realized that she had stayed in the washroom for too long. Luckily, she had calmed down a lot so she inhaled deeply before she walked out. However, thinking of having to meet Xin Bei again, Cao Wenxin was still nervous. She glanced around trying to find a vacant seat. Unfortunately, there were no vacant seats.

Cao Wenxin felt helpless. She had never been in such an embarrassing situation before and really didn’t know how to deal with it. In the end, Cao Wenxin had to go back to her seat.

Xin Bei probably also had no idea how to face Cao Wenxin, so he was wearing an eye mask, lying on his seat but no one knew whether he was really sleeping except himself.

Seeing that Xin Bei was sleeping, Cao Wenxin was relieved. She quietly walked by him, going back to her seat, and immediately put on her eye mask. However, she couldn’t fall asleep and couldn’t help thinking about what had just happened.

Cao Wenxin thought that she should never appear at the same place as Xin Bei, because nothing good had happened anytime they showed up together.

It was over half an hour before they landed in City B, and it was torture for Cao Wenxin. Finally, the plane landed, but Cao Wenxin was getting increasingly nervous, because she would see Xin Bei again when they got off the plane. It would drive her crazy!

When the plane stopped, Xin Bei stood up, walking to the door at once, because he felt embarrassed to meet Cao Wenxin too.

Feeling Xin Bei walking away, Cao Wenxin relaxed. She took off her eye mask, but didn’t get off the plane until two thirds of the passengers were gone. Therefore, she perfectly avoided Xin Bei.

It took at least three hours from the capital to City F so Gu Ning was still in the plane.

At this time, Leng Shaoting already gone back to the Leng family’s house. Leng Shaoxun and Leng Shaojia were quarreling violently in the yard.

It was all because of a bonsai.

The bonsai was Leng Shaoxun’s, and it was an orchid of a rare species. Leng Shaoxun put the bonsai in the yard, but it was knocked over by Leng Shaojia.

Leng Shaojia didn’t feel guilty at all, and refused to apologize. She had even mocked him. Leng Shaoxun was so angry that he had torn the piece of paper with Leng Shaojia’s new design on it into pieces.

The two had argued with each other ever since they were kids, but neither of them could win, so they kept quarreling all the time. Leng Shaoxun wouldn’t punch Leng Shaojia because she was a girl. Leng Shaojia also understood that. Therefore, no matter how much she hated him, she never dared to hit Leng Shaoxun.

The housekeeper tried to separate them in vain, so he gave up.

“Lord Leng, welcome home!” Leng Changzhi said to Leng Shaoting. Leng Shaoxun also ignored Leng Shaojia, and quickly walked to Leng Shaoting. “Shaoting! You’re finally home. Would you please practice kung fu with me?”

Although he was hardly comparable to Leng Shaoting, Leng Shaoxun wouldn’t miss any chance to practice with him. That was how he made progress.

Seeing Leng Shaoting, there was hatred that flashed through Leng Shaojia’s eyes, but she didn’t dare to argue with him, so she turned around and walked away.

Leng Shaoting didn’t care about Leng Shaojia’s attitude towards him and he agreed to practice kung fu with Leng Shaoxun after visiting his grandpa.

It was a cold winter, and Master Leng was reading in his study.

“Hi, I thought that I wouldn’t see you again during the festival!” Master Leng complained once Leng Shaoting appeared in his sight.

Leng Shaoting took out a porcelain bottle and placed it on the table before Master Leng. “Here, this is for you.”

“A porcelain bottle? Is it a real antique?” Master Leng asked.

“It’s not the bottle but the thing inside it,” Leng Shaoting said.

“The thing inside?” Master Leng was surprised. He opened the bottle and noticed that there was a round pill the size of a pearl that was shining like a diamond inside. “What is this?”

“A special medicine. It’s good for your body and you can take a pill every three days,” Leng Shaoting said.

Although Leng Shaoting trusted Gu Ning, this medicine was a gift to his grandpa, so he had to be careful and took a pill beforehand. The pill melted in his mouth within a second, and he felt a cold air spreading through his body. Once he took the medicine, he found that some of his old injuries recovered gradually. And that was when he realized that this medicine was really effective.

Master Leng then poured a pill into his mouth. He had the same experience as Leng Shaoting. “Wow, what medicine is this? I feel a cold air spreading through my body. It’s quite comfortable!”

Leng Shaoting didn’t answer his grandpa’s question, because he didn’t know the answer either. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Lin Lijuan and her two rich friends wen shop today. One had had conflict with Gu Ning before and was called Jin Lanxin. The other one was the same age as Lin Lijuan. She was called Mrs. Yang.

Mrs. Yang was Lin Lijuan and Jin Lanxin’s new friend. Her family had over a hundred million yuan in wealth, which was much more than the Gu family had so Lin Lijuan kept flattering Mrs. Yang

“I heard that the real boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry, the most popular jewelry brand recently, is an 18-year-old girl! I think her name is Gu Ning, and she lives in City F too. She’s such an outstanding girl!” Mrs. Yang said, but she didn’t know the relationship between Lin Lijuan and Gu Ning, so she wasn’t finding fault with Lin Lijuan.

Hearing that, Lin Lijuan was displeased. She hated Gu Ning and her family so much that her heart felt like it was being stabbed every time she heard one of their names. She didn’t feel pain, but hatred and humiliation. She still couldn’t figure out how, or accept that Gu Ning became so rich all of a sudden.

She wished that her own daughter could be so successful as well. In that case, she didn’t have to flatter others anymore, but other people would do their best to please her.
