Chapter 52: Li Zhenzhen

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

But for now, Qin Yifan only appreciated Gu Ning. There weren’t many people whom Qin Yifan thought highly of, so he was excited when he met Gu Ning again.

“Me too.” Gu Ning smiled.

“What a great coincidence! Come over here, we can take the plane together later,” Qin Yifan invited her with passion.

Gu Ning didn’t reject. She followed Qin Yifan to his seat.

Qin Yifan pulled out the chair for Gu Ning like a gentleman. The young lady seemed upset once more.

“What would you like to drink?” Qin Yifan asked.

“Coffee please,” Gu Ning replied.

Qin Yifan called the waiter, and ordered a cup of coffee for Gu Ning.

“Yifan, you haven’t introduced the girl to me yet.” the lady who sat aside opened her mouth. She called Qin Yifan in a deliberately intimate way.

Then, Qin Yifan immediately turned to the lady. “This is my friend, Gu Ning.”

“Gu Ning, this is my uncle’s daughter, Li Zhenzhen,” he said to Gu Ning.

“Nice to meet you, miss Li.” Although Gu Ning knew Li Zhenzhen disliked her, she greeted her politely since Li Zhenzhen didn’t actually hurt her yet.

“Nice to meet you too, miss Gu,” Li Zhenzhen replied. She hadn’t figured out the relations between Gu Ning and Qin Yifan, and didn’t want to be rude.

After that, Li Zhenzhen looked at Qin Yifan. “I think miss Gu is around 18 years old, right? Yifan, I’m curious how did you meet miss Gu?”

“I told you this afternoon. I bought a King’s Green in the size of a quail’s egg from a female student. The female student is Gu Ning,” Qin Yifan said. Saying that, Qin Yifan couldn’t help but show his appreciation of Gu Ning.

“Oh, that!” Knowing that, Li Zhenzhen was surprised. At the same time, she was upset, because she clearly saw Qin Yifan’s appreciation of the female student. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

She liked Qin Yifan, and had even told him plainly several times, but Qin Yifan explained that he only regarded her as his sister.

When Qin Yifan was with her, he always seemed serious. However, when he was with the female student, Gu Ning, he behaved so passionately. Li Zhenzhen was jealous.

“Oh, Gu Ning, what are you going to do in City G?” Qin Yifan asked.

“Just for a trip,” Gu Ning answered.

“Where are you going to stay?” Qin Yifan asked with care.

“I’ll stay in the Huangdeng Hotel in downtown,” Gu Ning replied.

Huangdeng Hotel was a five-star luxury hotel in City G. It cost hundreds of yuan to stay there for a night, but Gu Ning chose to stay there for a reason.

The hotel would arrange a free tailored car for its customers all day.

In an unfamiliar city, Gu Ning wasn’t willing to rent a car, nor wait for a taxi. It was much more convenient to have a full-time chauffeur.

Besides, she didn’t lack money now.

“Great, I’ll pass by the Huangdeng Hotel later. Do you need a lift?” Qin Yifan said.

“Yifan...” Hearing that, Li Zhenzhen was more displeased now. They wouldn’t pass by the Huangdeng Hotel at all. Actually the Huangdeng Hotel was far away from their destination!

It would be late at night when they arrived at City G. If they were going to the Huangdeng Hotel before going back home, they would have to waste more time on the road.

Li Zhenzhen actually didn’t care about the time. She simple disliked Gu Ning. If Gu Ning had been one of Qin Yifan’s male friends, she wouldn’t care at all.

But before Li Zhenzhen could say another word, Qin Yifan stopped her with a glance. Li Zhenzhen was a little mad now but she closed her mouth, because she didn’t want to ruin her elegant appearance.

Gu Ning obviously knew what was going on here. Even though it was convenient for Qin Yifan to give her a ride, Gu Ning had no intention to let him do that. Thus she refused, “Thank you so much, but the hotel will pick me up.”

“Well, fine.” If Gu Ning had said she would take a taxi, Qin Yifan would have insisted on driving her to the hotel, but since the hotel would pick her up, he didn’t insist.

“When will you be going back? If you have time, you can ask me out. I can take you for a tour since I’m free all day,” Qin Yifan said with delight. He totally forgot he was going to City G to deal with some business.

Li Zhenzhen was eager to interrupt, but Gu Ning opened her mouth first. “I’m going to deal with something there, and I’ll be back the day after tomorrow.”

Which meant she didn’t have time.

Before long, their plane was about to take off. Gu Ning’s and Qin Yifan’s seat were all in the first class. Li Zhenzhen felt extremely unhappy.

As long as Gu Ning was present, Qin Yifan would talk to her and ignore Li Zhenzhen.

Gu Ning had actually wanted to buy a ticket in economy class, but the economy class was all booked. Gu Ning then had to buy a ticket in the first class.

Qin Yifan, Li Zhenzhen and Gu Ning all sat on the second row. Gu Ning sat beside the aisle. Qin Yifan’s seat was beside the window, but he exchanged with Li Zhenzhen to sit next to Gu Ning.

Li Zhenzhen was annoyed. If not for her appearance, she would probably argue with Qin Yifan now.

Gu Ning actually didn’t want to talk much with Qin Yifan, especially in front of Li Zhenzhen. She didn’t want to cause any misunderstandings or trouble.

Therefore, when the plane moved up high to the sky, Gu Ning closed her eyes to have a rest.

Qin Yifan didn’t bother Gu Ning anymore.

Gu Ning didn’t close her eyes all the way, because it wouldn’t be natural.

An hour later, the plane landed at the airport of City G. Gu Ning and Qin Yifan walked out of the airport then separated.

Gu Ning found the car from the hotel. She got in and headed straight to the hotel.

When she arrived at the hotel, it was already 9:40 pm. She checked in, walking upstairs directly.

The minute Gu Ning stepped in the right elevator, the left elevator opened, and several men walked out.

The front man was Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning missed Leng Shaoting by seconds.

It wasn’t a big deal after all. They were merely strangers who had only met each other twice.

But it was still Gu Ning’s destiny to meet the man again.

Gu Ning went to her room and called Gu Man to tell her mother she was safe.

In case Gu Man would ask to talk with Mu Ke or Yu Mixi, Gu Ning hung up after a short time. She used an excuse that she needed to review some documents.

Gu Ning indeed was going to read documents. She hadn’t read the books about emeralds and jade yet! She wanted to make full use of her time, and read those books now.

But before that, Gu Ning used her WeChat, sending out a message to the “Family of Fighters” group to tell her friends that she had safely arrived.
