3247 Become Friends

Lin Musi secretly gave Li Mochen a glance. This man was so extraordinary, but was too cold. She was attracted to his appearance, but felt scared of him too.

Leng Xiaoyao could see that Lin Musi had interest in Li Mochen, and thought she should let her know that she should give up since they might end up as friends.

Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao moved closer to Li Mochen and said, “Brother Mochen, will you send me to City Chang tomorrow? Or are you going to stay here to deal with it?”

“I’ll send you home. They will stay here,” Li Mochen said. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Leng Xiaoyao told Li Mochen that she had heard those people say that they had already caught a batch of people, but that an accident happened so they couldn’t move the victims. It might take them four or five days.

Therefore, the victims wouldn’t arrive for at least two days. They didn’t need to rush to handle it so Li Mochen had time to send Leng Xiaoyao home.

Although it might not be four or five days, Mu Yiyang and the others were here. They could deal with it because they already knew where the base was.

In addition, they needed to go to the Island of Bones again tonight to set some cameras around it. They needed to see the sea in all directions. Once a boat came, they would know.

They were in City Qin. Normally, they needed to set off from Qin Customs to the Island of Bones, but they could also set off from a place where there was a shore.

In fact, Leng Xiaoyao could go home on her own, but she knew that Li Mochen wouldn’t let her go alone. Moreover, she wanted Lin Musi to misunderstand their relationship, so she deliberately mentioned it.

“Great.” Leng Xiaoyao answered.

“When do you want to go home tomorrow? I’ll book the tickets,” asked Li Mochen.

“After lunch,” Leng Xiaoyao replied.

“No problem,” said Li Mochen.

Seeing that Leng Xiaoyao was so close to Li Mochen, Lin Musi was upset. However, she only had interest in Li Mochen and there was no love, so she wasn’t too affected.

“Miss Leng, do you live in City Chang?” asked Dai Ya.

“Yeah, where do you live, Miss Dai?” asked Leng Xiaoyao. Even though she had already investigated their backgrounds, she couldn’t let them know.

“City Hai.” Dai Ya replied. Knowing that Leng Xiaoyao lived in City Chang, Dai Ya didn’t disdain her. Leng Xiaoyao’s family wouldn’t be comparable to the Dai family even if her family was the richest family in City Chang. However, Leng Xiaoyao had abilities.

“Miss Leng, you look very young. Can I know your age?” asked Dai Ya.

“I’m eighteen,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Both Dai Ya and Lin Musi were shocked. They knew that Leng Xiaoyao was very young, but unexpectedly she was only eighteen years old.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t look older than her age, but her abilities made people ignore her age.

Mu Yiyang interrupted. “Oh, I didn’t remember your age until you mentioned it. You don’t look eighteen.”

Hearing that, Leng Xiaoyao was displeased. She squinted and looked dangerous. “Do you mean I look older than my age?”

Nobody wants to look old, including Leng Xiaoyao.

Li Mochen immediately turned to warn Mu Yiyang with a glance. Mu Yiyang was scared and explained at once. “I didn’t mean that. I’m saying that Leng Xiaoyao is so impressive that people easily ignore her age. I don’t think any other senior high school students could be like her. Knowing kung fu, car racing, stone gambling, and so on.”

“You’re right.” Leng Xiaoyao was pleased, and so was Li Mochen.

It was fine that he complimented Leng Xiaoyao, but Li Mochen wouldn’t accept it if he dared to criticize her.

Dai Ya and Lin Musi were even more surprised. Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t just good at kung fu, she was also excellent at car racing, stone gambling, and so on.

“Miss Leng, you can race cars and stone gamble too?” Dai Ya was impressed. She was shocked, but she believed them because she had already witnessed Leng Xiaoyao’s skills.

If not, she would really doubt them. After all, Leng Xiaoyao was so young.

“I’m not bad,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She wasn’t being too modest or arrogant.

Even if Leng Xiaoyao only said that she wasn’t bad at all those things, Dai Ya didn’t think it was the truth.

In the private room.

Leng Xiaoyao and Mu Yiyang sat next to Li Mochen’s. On the other side of Leng Xiaoyao were Dai Ya and Lin Musi, while Mu Yuan and Meng Fan sat on Mu Yiyang’s other side.

Li Mochen asked Leng Xiaoyao to order. After Leng Xiaoyao ordered, Dai Ya and Lin Musi could order what they wanted to eat.

However, Dai Ya and Lin Musi hesitated to do that, so Leng Xiaoyao did it for them.

After ordering, they chatted for a while. Li Mochen, Mu Yuan, and Meng Fan stayed quiet while Mu Yiyang sometimes chimed in.

Leng Xiaoyao had no intention of introducing Li Mochen and the others to Dai Ya and Lin Musi. She wanted to make friends with them, but Li Mochen and the others didn’t have that intention. Therefore, there was no need to do an introduction.

Dai Ya was smart, so she said nothing when Leng Xiaoyao didn’t introduce them to one another. Anyway, she already heard their names at the Island of Bones.

Lin Musi felt slightly embarrassed, so she rarely talked.

“Miss Leng, you’re going to write the National College Entrance Examination, right? Which university is your target?” asked Dai Ya.

“The Capital University,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Well, you must be an excellent student,” Dai Ya said. She was very impressed by Leng Xiaoyao.

“I’m not bad.” Leng Xiaoyao answered, admitting that she was good at studying.

“Miss Leng, can we exchange phone numbers? If you go to City Hai in the future, I can be your guide,” Dai Ya suggested.

“Sure!” Leng Xiaoyao agreed and exchanged phone numbers with Dai Ya. Afterwards, She asked Lin Musi, “How about you, Miss Lin?”

“Of course.” Lin Musi agreed. Although she wasn’t like Dai Ya and had no intention of becoming friends with Leng Xiaoyao, it wasn’t bad if they could form a good relationship.

No matter what, Leng Xiaoyao had saved her life. She shouldn’t embarrass Leng Xiaoyao even if she was unwilling to exchange phone numbers with her.

After the meal, they separated.

At this time, it was dark. Li Mochen and the others went to buy cameras, then visited the Island of Bones again.

Lin Mu and the others arrived as well. Mu Yiyang didn’t need them to visit the Island of Bones together, so he told them to have a meal first and wait for them in the hotel.

Dai Ya and Lin Musi didn’t go anywhere and directly returned to their rooms.

When Dai Ya saw that Lin Musi was a little upset, she asked, “What’s wrong?”

“Nothing,” Lin Musi said.

Since she said that, Dai Ya didn’t ask further.
