Chapter 622 Does She Like Tang Qingyang?

“Oh, why don’t we exchange phone numbers? You can turn to me for help if you encounter any trouble in the capital. You’re Qinyin’s friend after all, so you’re my friend too,” Jiang Ruiqin said kindly. He seemed calm, but was actually very nervous because he was afraid that Gu Ning would reject him.

Tang Qingyang, who was Jiang Ruiqin’s close friend, also noticed that Jiang Ruiqin liked Gu Ning. He had never seen Jiang Ruiqin being so kind and gentle to a girl when they met for the first time.

“Sure, tell me your phone number.” Gu Ning agreed, because Jiang Ruiqin was Jiang Zhongyu’s grandson and she would meet him in the future.

Hearing that, Jiang Ruiqin finally relaxed, then told Gu Ning his number. Gu Ning called him, then hung up at once.

“Mr. Tang, why don’t we exchange phone numbers too?” Gu Ning took the initiative to ask for Tang Qingyang’s number because she knew that she was going to cooperate with him.

Jiang Ruiqin, however, felt upset, and couldn’t help wondering whether Gu Ning liked Tang Qingyang. Tang Qingyang also had the same idea, so he hesitated. Although he thought that Gu Ning was very attractive, he gave up once he found out that Jiang Ruiqin liked her. However, he felt shy to reject Gu Ning, so he agreed.

Gu Ning didn’t know what they were thinking. If she knew, she would explain to them that she already had a boyfriend.

After a while of silence, Jiang Ruiqin asked Tang Qingyang, “Qingyang, when will you start to work in the company?”.

“Tomorrow,” Tang Qingyang said.

“Are you ready for it?” Jiang Ruiqin asked.

“Yeah,” Tang Qingyang said lightly. Although he sounded relaxed, Gu Ning sensed that he was quite stressed. Although Tang Qingyang didn’t say it aloud, Gu Ning understood that he was going to fight on the battlefield.

Before long, Gu Ning found that someone was stalking them. She used her Jade Eyes and saw a familiar face in the car behind them. She had met him in her previous incarnation.

The man was in his early thirties, and worked for Tang Bingsen. Gu Ning had seen him a few times in her previous incarnation. Without a doubt, Gu Ning understood that he had to be stalking Tang Qingyang. However, she didn’t know the reason why Tang Bingsen sent him to follow Tang Qingyang.

Gu Ning actually didn’t know his real name, but people all called him Lao Gui. Besides, Lao Gui was very good at fighting. Although Gu Ning wasn’t afraid of him, she was worried that Tang Qingyang might not be his match. Therefore, Gu Ning had to do something

“Mr. Jiang, how is your driving skill?” Gu Ning asked.

“Not bad.” Jiang Ruiqin thought that Gu Ning was just chatting with him; he didn’t know that someone was stalking them.

“Can you see the black ORV (1. Off Road Vehicle.] behind us? It’s been following us for a long time. I think someone is stalking us,” Gu Ning said.

“What?” Hearing that, both Jiang Ruiqin and Tang Qingyang were surprised, then displeased.

Tang Qingyang turned back, and saw a car following not far behind them. Even though they had made several turns, the car still followed them.

At this moment, they were sure that someone was stalking them.

“I think I’m the target,” Tang Qingyang said. Although he said it with doubt, he was very sure that he was the target, because he clearly knew that he was in a very dangerous situation now.

“What should we do?” Jiang Ruiqin asked in a deep voice.

“Are you confident that you can get rid of him? If you’re not, let me do it,” Gu Ning said with a serious face.

A touch of embarrassment flashed by Jiang Ruiqin’s face. “I don’t think I can do it. Can you?” He wasn’t doubting Gu Ning’s ability, but he was worried about her safety.

“I can,” Gu Ning said with confidence.

Ever since Jiang Ruiqin got to know what Gu Ning had done, he had great admiration for Gu Ning and he trusted her. “No problem. Let me stop it by the roadside first.”

Saying that, he stopped the car. When they stopped, the car behind them stopped too.

There was a lot of traffic on the road. Jiang Ruiqin and Tang Qingyang would probably never have noticed it if Gu Ning hadn’t told them.

“In order not to arouse their suspicion, Mr. Tang, please go buy several bottles of water. Mr. Jiang, you can stay in the car and directly moved to the rear seats, and I’ll replace you,” Gu Ning said.

“No problem!

Jiang Ruiqin and Tang Qingyang agreed and started to take action. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Tang Qingyang who was sitting in the front passenger’s seat got out of the car and walked to a nearby convenience store. At the same time, Jiang Ruiqin moved to the rear seats from the driver’s seat and was replaced by Gu Ning. Before long, Tang Qingyang was back and got in the car again.

Lao Gui didn’t notice any change from behind.

Afterwards, Gu Ning reminded them to be prepared, and then she started the car.

In the beginning, she drove it at the regular speed, then suddenly accelerated it. She didn’t even bother to slow down when there was a lot of traffic, and she could always masterfully overtake other cars on the road.

Other drivers on the road all noticed a black private car smoothly moving at a high speed among the traffic. They kept swearing, but had to admit that the driver of the black private car was really skillful.

Jiang Ruiqin and Tang Qingyang were both shocked. Even Lao Gui was astonished, and thought that he might have been discovered.

Thinking of that, Lao Gui stopped following, in case he would expose himself. After all, he had only received the order to follow Tang Qingyang and see what Tang Qingyang was doing and whom Tang Qingyang was hanging out with. There was no need for him to attack Tang Qingyang right now.

Seeing that Lao Gui stop following, Gu Ning and the others were a little surprised, but didn’t think further.

Lao Gui called Tang Bingsen the moment he stopped following Tang Qingyang, and reported on what had just happened.

At that moment, Tang Bingsen was having sex with his mistress, Tian Feifei, in a big house.

Tang Bingsen was an aged old man after all, and his body was already out of shape, while Tian Feifei was young and hot. However, she had to sell her body for money and fame, and even pretended to have orgasms when Tang Bingsen penetrated her to please him.

Tang Bingsen was in his late fifties now, and he easily ran out of strength.
