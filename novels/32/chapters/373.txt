Chapter 374 Leng Shaoting Is Back!

The old lady fell down, trembling and had a fever the moment that she got back home. Gu Qinxiang immediately sent his mother to the hospital and called Gu Qinyang. Gu Qinyang’s family went to visit the old lady at once. Although the family reunion didn’t end well today, the old lady was Gu Qing and Gu Man’s mother after all, so Gu Qinxiang still called them and told them that the old lady was sick.

Gu Qing and Gu Man didn’t feel sad or nervous when they heard the news because they had already given up the so-called family connection with their mother. Nevertheless, they would go and visit their mother since the old lady was sick.

Gu Ning was reluctant to see the old lady again, but she was worried about Gu Man, thus she went to the hospital along with them. However, Gu Ning didn’t walk into the hospital, but waited outside.

The old lady had already lost consciousness when she was admitted to the hospital. And because of what had happened today, Gu Qinxiang didn’t dare to criticize Gu Qing or Gu Man anymore. In that case, it was quite harmonious in the patient room.

While Gu Ning was waiting outside, she received Leng Shaoting’s call.

“Ningning, what are you up to right now?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“I’m at the hospital,” Gu Ning answered.

“What’s wrong? Do you feel uncomfortable?” Leng Shaoting was nervous.

“No, it’s not me. Just a relative,” Gu Ning explained.

“Oh.” Leng Shaoting sensed that it wasn’t an important person from Gu Ning’s tone.

“When will you be back?” Leng Shaoting asked again.

“A while later I guess,” Gu Ning said. She didn’t think further about why Leng Shaoting asked that.

Gu Qing and Gu Man left the hospital a few minutes later. And when they had almost arrived at Fenghua Luxury Mansion, Gu Ning received Leng Shaoting’s call once more. However, because Gu Man was with her, it wasn’t convenient for Gu Ning to answer Leng Shaoting’s call. She cut the call off and texted him.

Leng Shaoting then sent a message back to her. I’m waiting for you outside of Fenghua Luxury Mansion in a black car.

Reading the message, Gu Ning’s hands trembled and her phone almost fell. She was so excited and surprised that Leng Shaoting would come to City F.

“Mom, Peihan is inviting me to sing karaoke, so I’ll get out at the gate of Fenghua Luxury Mansion,” Gu Ning lied. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t be home too late!” Gu Man knew that Chu Peihan was Gu Ning’s friend, so she didn’t stop Gu Ning. And it wasn’t very late at that moment.

Gu Ning then got out of the car at the gate of Fenghua Luxury Mansion.

The minute that she was out of the car, Gu Ning noticed the black car parked at the front. She knew that Leng Shaoting was in it, but wasn’t in a hurry to go over there until Jiang Xu drove away.

Leng Shaoting left the car without delay when Gu Ning walked near. He had seen Gu Ning earlier on, but had to curb his desire to hug her because her family hadn’t left yet. Watching Gu Ning stepping towards him, Leng Shaoting was thrilled and couldn’t wait to hold her in his arms, but he still controlled himself to not do so because there were a lot of people around. Leng Shaoting could only open the car door for Gu Ning quietly, but there was a burning desire in his eyes.

Gu Ning had the same feelings.

Once Gu Ning was in the car, Leng Shaoting closed the car door and sat in the driver’s seat. He clasped Gu Ning’s hand in his, fixing his eyes on her with passion.

“Where should we go now?” Gu Ning asked.

“No idea,” Leng Shaoting replied.

“Just talk for a while in the car?” Gu Ning asked.

Leng Shaoting frowned a little. Apparently that wasn’t what he wanted.

“Well, then what should we do?” Gu Ning asked. “Um, I’m staying in a hotel tonight,” Leng Shaoting said. He was implying something. Gu Ning flushed and turned her face aside. “Let’s go there then!”

With Gu Ning’s permission, Leng Shaoting’s eyes lit up at once and he drove ahead to the hotel.

To calm her embarrassment, Gu Ning changed the topic. “Did you finish your work?”

“Yeah,” Leng Shaoting said.

“When will you go home for the New Year festival?” Gu Ning asked.

“Tomorrow afternoon,” Leng Shaoting replied.

During their small talk, a picture suddenly emerged before Gu Ning’s eyes. She saw that a shadow secretly came to a car and pried the car door open before he cut the brakes. Gu Ning recognized that it was An Guangyao’s car. Although she didn’t foresee what was going to happen next, it would be dangerous if the brakes of the car were broken.

Gu Ning immediately realized that An Guangyao was in danger, and called him at once.

An Guangyao answered her call within seconds. Before he could say anything, Gu Ning asked, “Uncle An, where are you now?”

“I’m in the Kadun Hotel. The party is over and I’m going home. What’s up?” An Guangyao said.

“I have something important to discuss with you. Don’t leave and wait at the hotel for me,” Gu Ning said seriously.

“Sure,” An Guangyao replied.

When Leng Shaoting heard that Gu Ning was going to meet An Guangyao, his face changed slightly, but he understood that it had to be an emergency. Anyway, they would spend the night together, so he didn’t mind changing the place.

Gu Ning also understood it was strange that she suddenly changed the plan, so she explained, “Well, Uncle An is at a party tonight, and I just had a premonition that something bad is going to happen, so I have to stop it. I’m sorry if that sounds strange.”

It did sound strange, but Leng Shaoting chose to believe Gu Ning as always.

In the parking lot, a pair of eyes stared at An Guangyao from a car which was only 10 meters away from An Guangyao’s. Seeing that An Guangyao answered a call and went back into the hotel, the man thought that An Guangyao had something else to deal with, so he kept waiting in the car.

Leng Shaoting drove fast and steadily, so they soon arrived at Kadun Hotel.

The moment that Gu Ning got out, she called An Guangyao. An Guangyao told her he was in a tea room, and Gu Ning along with Leng Shaoting quickly went to meet him. Only An Guangyao and Zhang Shunjie were in the tea room when they came inside.

“Nice to meet you, boss and Mr. Leng!” An Guangyao and Zhang Shunjie greeted Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting walked over and sat down. Zhang Shunjie poured two cups of tea for them. “How was the party?” Gu Ning asked.

“Not bad. We just had some conflicts with Wu Lianqin,” An Guangyao replied.

“Why?” Gu Ning asked.
