Chapter 846: Zi Beiying Is Going Home

He knew that Yu Zi didn’t hate him, but he wasn’t certain whether she liked him or not. Therefore, he was very nervous when he confessed his affection to her. Luckily, she agreed to be his girlfriend.

Yang Ziqian took the bunch of red roses from the waiter’s hands, then handed it to Yu Zi. “This is for you.”

All of a sudden, Yu Zi felt like crying.

“Thanks!” She took the bunch of flowers and smiled.

...

Right at this moment, Zi Beiying received a call from Zi Shaomin. He told her that their father was already conscious, and that she should go home now.

The Zi family never thought lightly of girls, so Zi Beiying had received as good an education and training as her older brother. Her father also spoiled her, but she wasn’t spoiled rotten. However, her older brother was still the appointed heir of their family.

There was no need for Zi Beiying to stay in City B any longer, especially after she found out that Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend was Gu Ning, so she was ready to go home.

Before she left, she planned to share a meal with Gu Ning, because she sincerely treated her as her friend.

“Oh, Shaomin, I need to tell you one thing,” Zi Beiying said when she was about to hang up the call with Zi Shaomin.

“What?” Zi Shaomin asked.

“Shaoting already has a girlfriend,” Zi Beiying said, and sounded calm.

“Really?” Zi Shaomin was shocked.

It was indeed a piece of shocking news, because he knew that Leng Shaoting never showed much interest in women. In that case, he was very shocked when he heard that Leng Shaoting had a girlfriend now.

“Are you alright?” he asked Zi Beiying with concern. He knew how much Zi Beiying liked Leng Shaoting.

“I’m fine. I felt sad at the beginning, but I didn’t feel upset at all when I saw his girlfriend,” Zi Beiying said.

“Why?” Zi Shaomin was curious.

“His girlfriend is exactly the girl who gave me those magical pills. I have a more powerful family than her, but she’s better than me on every other level. So I really admire her,” Zi Beiying said in a serious tone.

“What? The owner of those magical pills is Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend?” Zi Shaomin was astonished.

“Yeah,” Zi Beiying said. She admired Gu Ning, so she wasn’t jealous of her.

Zi Shaomin remained silent for a while, then said, “Beiying, actually I think that Xu Jinchen is also a good choice.”

“Come on! I don’t have affection towards him at all,” Zi Beiying said. It wasn’t the first time that her older brother had recommended Xu Jinchen to her. An idea dawned on her. “Shaomin, are you interested in him?” Zi Beiying joked.

Hearing that, both Mengda and Nan who stood by Zi Beiying’s sides were surprised.

“Nonsense!” Zi Shaomin raised his voice. “I only like women, alright?”

“Fine, but stop mentioning Xu Jinchen anymore!” Zi Beiying pulled her lips.

Zi Shaomin didn’t know what else he could say, so he hung up the call.

Zi Beiying called Gu Ning at once, and invited her along with Leng Shaoting to share a meal before she went home. Gu Ning agreed.

Zi Beiying also invited Xu Jinchen and Xin Bei. They agreed too.

Gu Ning still knew nothing about the fact that Zi Beiying had liked Leng Shaoting. Leng Shaoting didn’t tell her either, because it wasn’t important in his eyes. Zi Beiying had already given up chasing him right now, so it was unnecessary to bring it up. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The appointed time was 6 pm, but it was still early, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting decided to enjoy a ride.

Gu Ning said to Leng Shaoting, “I need to leave for HK the day after tomorrow.”

“What are you going to do there?” Leng Shaoting asked.

Gu Ning then told him the truth, “It’s the 50th anniversary of the He family’s casino on March 28. On that day, the current leading role of the He family, He Hongjie, and his younger brother, He Hongyuan, will have a competition for the leading position by gambling. He Hongjie is losing his hearing, and his second son who’s the best gambler in the family is still missing, so his daughter, He Siyin, turned to me for help. She offered me five hundred million yuan as compensation. If I win, I can get the money along with the bet in the gambling match with He Hongyuan. If I lose, she won’t force me to take responsibility, so I agreed.”

“I’m going back to the capital tomorrow. If I’m free that day, I’ll meet you there.” Leng Shaoting was worried about Gu Ning if she went to HK alone, but he knew that he couldn’t stop her once she made up her mind. Accordingly, he would do everything he could to protect her.

“Great.” Gu Ning nodded.

...

When it was around 4 pm, Lu Zhan called Gu Ning and told her that Infinite Horror was already done.

Gu Ning told him to report for duty in her company at the capital, then made a copy of the original film. She would send someone to get it. Lu Zhan agreed, and said that he would leave for the capital tomorrow.

Afterwards, Gu Ning called K and told him what Lu Zhan had just told her. She also called Lu Xiao later. Lu Xiao would make arrangement for Lu Zhan’s work.
