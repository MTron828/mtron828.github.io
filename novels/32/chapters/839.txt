Chapter 840: You Could Be Sentenced in Jail

Because Gu Ning was going to attend the competition tomorrow, Leng Shaoting let her go after an hour, in case she couldn’t get up the next morning.

Gu Ning, however, wasn’t worried about it at all. She understood that Leng Shaoting was limiting his desire, so she aroused him on her own initiative. Leng Shaoting couldn’t resist it, then had sex with her again and again.

The next day, both Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting woke up at 6 am. Leng Shaoting’s eyes were unusually bright, staring at her. “Ningning, you were very active last night.”

Gu Ning flushed and moved her eyes away, then got off the bed. Although they were close to each other now, Gu Ning still felt shy talking about sex with him.

Before Gu Ning could walk away, Leng Shaoting reached out his big palm and pulled her back into his arms. “It’s still early. Lie with me for a while longer.”

Gu Ning didn’t struggle, and let Leng Shaoting hug her in his arms. However, when their bodies touched again. Leng Shaoting was aroused once more. Gu Ning’s face went red after feeling that something stiff was pressed against her lower body.

“Ningning, why don’t we do some morning exercises?” Leng Shaoting’s hoarse voice sounded by Gu Ning’s ears. He lost control of himself.

Gu Ning didn’t say anything, which was a silent agreement.

Leng Shaoting then directly penetrated her from behind. It took almost half an hour this time before Leng Shaoting had enough.

Gu Ning had to use her magical power to boost her energy.

After that, Leng Shaoting wanted to carry Gu Ning to the bathroom to have a shower together, but Gu Ning rejected, in case Leng Shaoting got another erection.

When Gu Ning walked out of the bathroom a while later, Leng Shaoting had already prepared breakfast for her. After breakfast, Leng Shaoting drove Gu Ning to the Bluesky Hotel.

It was 7:40 am when Gu Ning arrived. At this moment, there were many students gathered in the hall along with three buses stopped outside.

Song Siyao had good eyesight, and noticed Gu Ning getting out of a luxurious car. She instantly believed that Gu Ning must have a sugar-daddy. In her eyes, Gu Ning was just a common student from City F, and it was impossible for Gu Ning to know anyone who could afford a luxurious car in City B. The second Gu Ning walked inside, Song Siyao said acidly, “It turns out someone refused to stay in this hotel because she had to go to sleep with her sugar-daddy!”

Even though Song Siyao didn’t say a name, her sight fell on Gu Ning. It was obvious she was talking about Gu Ning. Moreover, Gu Ning was the only one who didn’t stay in this hotel.

Hearing that, everyone in the hall turned to look at Song Siyao, then Gu Ning. They started to wonder whether Gu Ning really had a sugar-daddy like Song Siyao said.

“Song Siyao, shut your mouth! Stop spreading rumors, or I’ll punch you!” Before Gu Ning could say anything, Zhang Zikai defended her.

“I’m not talking about you. Why are you so angry? Are you covering the truth for her?” Song Siyao retorted. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Then are you talking about me?” Gu Ning coldly looked at her.

“I didn’t say a name. If you think that you’re the girl, it’s not my fault,” Song Siyao said.

“That’s interesting.” Gu Ning smiled suddenly, but Song Siyao felt scared.

“Song Siyao, don’t play smart with me. Nobody is an idiot here. I haven’t bothered to punish you, but it doesn’t mean that I won’t do anything if you keep annoying me,” Gu Ning said.

“How dare you threaten me! Who do you think you are?” Song Siyao was mad.

“It’s none of your business who I am, and I’m not interested in knowing more about you either. Stay away from me.” Gu Ning warned, then ignored Song Siyao and walked to Zhang Zikai.

“You...” Song Siyao was in a rage. She had never been warned by a girl who was nobody in her eyes like that before, and she felt humiliated now. “I just saw you getting out of a luxurious car. You’re just a poor girl who comes from a third-tier city, and it’s impossible for you to know anyone who’s rich, so the man who just drove you here must be your sugar-daddy!”

The moment Song Siyao finished, she was slapped across the face.

Gu Ning did it loudly, and everyone held his or her breath while looking at them.

Song Siyao couldn’t believe what Gu Ning just did to her. “H-How dare you slap me!” Saying that, she raised her hand trying to slap Gu Ning.

However, Gu Ning caught her hand the moment she raised it. “So what? I already warned you, but you wouldn’t listen. Do you think I’m someone you can mess with? You have no evidence to prove that I have a sugar-daddy, and it’s pure slander. You could be sentenced to jail. Do you understand?”

Gu Ning didn’t care about others’ opinions towards her, but it didn’t mean that she would tolerate humiliation. She had warned Song Siyao to stop it, but Song Siyao had refused to do so.

“You...” Song Siyao was frightened by Gu Ning’s cold eyes.

Others around them were surprised by Gu Ning’s quick movement.

“What’s going on here?” Song Siyao’s teacher walked over at this time, and he frowned when he saw the scene.

“She just slapped me!” Song Siyao told on Gu Ning before Gu Ning could say a word, then cried like she was the innocent one.

Gu Ning threw Song Siyao’s hand away. She didn’t bother to argue, and wasn’t afraid at all.

“Gu Ning, tell me what happened?”

To Song Siyao’s surprise, her teacher didn’t criticize Gu Ning, but instead asked Gu Ning for more details.

Song Siyao’s teacher knew her character very well, and he knew that she must have done something which annoyed Gu Ning in the first place for Gu Ning to have slapped her.

“What?” Song Siyao couldn’t believe that her teacher didn’t side with her right away.
