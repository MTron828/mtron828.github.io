Chapter 1323: Didn’t Take It to Heart

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The two paparazzi said with excitement, “Miss Gu, it’s so nice to meet you! We didn’t expect that we could meet you here. It’s our honor!”

“We’ve heard a lot about you!”

Gu Ning became famous because of her abilities.

“Thanks.” Gu Ning smiled at them.

“Oh, Miss Gu, can you tell us what just happened?” Paparazzi A asked. It was obvious that he already sided with Gu Ning.

Hu Jiali and her agent had a premonition at once, and wanted to stop him, but didn’t know how because they were in a public place right now.

“Well, I just happened to be waiting for the plane at the same gate as this lady, so I followed her along the way. She probably mistook me for a fan,” Gu Ning said. She didn’t bother to criticize Hu Jiali, and she had no interest in making a bitter complaint.

Nobody was an idiot, and many people realized what really had happened after hearing Gu Ning’s explanation.

Since it was just a misunderstanding, why would they argue over it? Who caused this trouble? It must have been Hu Jiali, but why would she do that?

People’s sight fell on Hu Jiali with curiosity and

suspicion.

Hu Jiali was mad again, feeling humiliated, but her agent gave her a glare of warning.

Although people believed Gu Ning when she said that she wouldn’t ask for Hu Jiali’s photos of her own accord, it wasn’t common that a star would refuse to take photos. Therefore, many people were confused.

Hu Jiali’s agent explained at once. “We were constantly followed by some fans earlier, and it’s quite bothersome. We didn’t know that Miss Gu was going to wait at the same gate as us, and we mistook her for another fan. Jiali has been very busy recently, so she doesn’t have much patience now.”

After that, she apologized to Gu Ning. “Miss Gu, we’re so sorry for the misunderstanding. Please forgive us.”

Saying that, the agent even bowed to Gu Ning.

Since Hu Jiali’s agent already apologized, Gu Ning couldn’t continue to blame her.

“It’s fine. I didn’t take it to heart,” Gu Ning said. She looked very kind and decided to forgive them.

Hu Jiali’s agent made an apology and Gu Ning chose to forgive them, so onlookers stopped paying much attention to this drama. Within seconds, they all walked away in different directions.

The two paparazzi also stopped asking about it further. Nevertheless, they would definitely report this news given Gu Ning’s fame and popularity. Most importantly, it wouldn’t have any bad effect on Gu Ning, so there was nothing they needed to be worried about.

Although the problem was solved, Hu Jiali was still annoyed because she was even more jealous of Gu Ning now after finding out that Gu Ning was an important figure.

Hu Jiali and her agent sat further away from Gu Ning afterwards.

When they were all gone, the girl stayed and suddenly got nervous. “Um, Goddess Gu, can I take a photo with you? I really like you.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Sure,” Gu Ning said with a smile.

With Gu Ning’s permission, the girl cheered up and took out her phone at once to take photos with Gu Ning.

“Thanks, Goddess Gu!” the girl thanked Gu Ning afterwards.

“You’re welcome,” Gu Ning said. “I should thank you for your brave act earlier.”

“It’s nothing. I knew the woman did it on purpose because she’s jealous of you,” the girl said.

Gu Ning was a little surprised by this girl’s sensitivity.

“Oh, Goddess Gu, I haven’t told you my name yet. My name’s Cai Xiya and I live in the capital. I just wrote the National College Entrance Examination too, and I heard that you’re going to study in the Capital University, so I plan to apply to the same college as you. If you don’t mind, we can exchange our numbers,” Cai Xiya said. She was very polite and had good manners. If Cai Xiya planned to apply to the Capital University, she must be an excellent student as well.

“Why not!” Gu Ning was willing to get along with kind people. She was a businesswoman, not a star, so she didn’t care about it too much.

However, Gu Ning already had the idea to register a new number. She would have two phone numbers. One for work, while the other one for private life. Only her good friends and family would have her private number.
