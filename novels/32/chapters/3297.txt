3300 I Came to Wait for You

“Didn’t I tell you not to pick me up? Why did you still go to the airport?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“I was just sending a friend off. Since you were about to arrive, I thought I’d wait for you.” Li Mochan replied.

Despite being able to lie without batting an eye, he suddenly felt a bit guilty.

“I thought you came specifically to wait for me!” Leng Xiaoyao said disappointedly.

“Actually…” Li Mochan was anxious and wanted to explain it.

However, he stopped right after opening his mouth. He realized that explaining might only make things worse, so he decided not to.

“What were you going to say?” Leng Xiaoyao persisted.

“Nothing,” said Li Mochen.

“Fine!” Leng Xiaoyao didn’t ask any further, but her mood had already become despondent. She gazed out of the window and said nothing else.

Li Mochan understood that she was angry, so he couldn’t hold it in any longer. “I did actually come to wait for you. Waiting is waiting, whether it’s at the airport or elsewhere.”

Honestly, Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t really angry. She wasn’t that petty! She simply couldn’t resist teasing Li Mochan a bit.

When he admitted it, she wanted to tease him again. “So why did you say you were sending off a friend? Could it be that you like me but don’t want me to know, so you’re feeling guilty and can’t tell the truth?”

“That’s not the reason.” Li Mochan immediately denied, looking as if he was worried that Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t believe him. However, why was he also worried that she would believe his words?

This strange feeling made Li Mochan feel conflicted. He couldn’t understand what was happening to him.

Like?

Li Mochan hadn’t yet acknowledged his feelings for Leng Xiaoyao, but he often thought of her and even dreamed about her, wanting to see her…

“Okay, I guess I was overthinking things,” Leng Xiaoyao said disappointedly.

Li Mochan opened his mouth, but said nothing.

Half an hour later, Li Mochan took Leng Xiaoyao to an old-fashioned roast duck restaurant. Since they were in the capital city, they might as well try the original local cuisine. They could eat something else elsewhere anyway.

Leng Xiaoyao was quite nostalgic about roast duck. In her previous incarnation, she grew up in the capital city and often ate the local specialty. She just didn’t know if the taste was still the same!

She had previously searched for pictures of the capital city of Seven Star Country online and found that it was different from the capital city she had been in in her previous incarnation.

They arrived relatively early, so there were still plenty of seats available. Li Mochen directly requested a private room.

Although Gao Qilu was unwilling, she was still taken to the Leng family’s mansion by Gao Zhongheng.

Gao Qilu knew about Leng Xiaoyao’s participation in the national competition in the capital city today, but she forgot about it due to all these events.

It wasn’t until they arrived at the Leng family’s mansion that they found out Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t there and had gone to the capital city to participate in the National Liberal Arts Defense.

However, since they were already here, they naturally had to tell the Leng family why they came. Even if the Leng family didn’t know yet, wouldn’t they start to suspect and investigate if they suddenly showed up like this? The Leng family would know about their purpose sooner or later.

Therefore, if they didn’t say it, it would only make things worse.

All of the members of the Leng family were present. They were very surprised by Gao Zhongheng and his daughter’s arrival. Although they knew each other, they had never been close. After all, a family like the Gao family wouldn’t bother with socializing with a family like the Leng family.

“What brings Chairman Gao to our door?” Leng Changyuan asked.

Gao Zhongheng was slightly embarrassed, but he still said, “The thing is, my daughter had a conflict with Leng Xiaoyao, and made a mistake. So I brought her here to apologize to Leng Xiaoyao and to see what compensation she wants. We will do our best to make up for it.”

Upon hearing that, everyone was shocked.

“What? What did you do to Yaoyao?” Leng Changyuan asked emotionally, looking at Gao Qilu with anger in his eyes.

Although Gao Qilu was a young lady from the Gao family, she was still a teenager, while Leng Changyuan was someone who had held leadership positions before, his authority and presence weren’t something Gao Qilu could bear. At most, she could use her status to make trouble for her peers.

As a result, when Leng Changyuan showed his power, Gao Qilu felt greatly oppressed. Even Gao Zhongheng was slightly affected and immediately explained. “Master Leng, rest assured that Leng Xiaoyao hasn’t been harmed in any way. I only found out about this after it happened and brought my daughter here to apologize as soon as possible.”

“What did she do to Yaoyao?” Leng Yecheng asked coldly. Even if Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t harmed, if Gao Qilu had laid a hand on her, it couldn’t be overlooked.

Gao Zhongheng found it difficult to be honest at the moment. He regretted coming directly to the Leng family’s mansion. If he had known that the Leng family didn’t know about this incident, he would have first found Leng Xiaoyao’s phone number and contacted her.

Perhaps she might not tell her family about it after the call!

“Um, can we talk to Leng Xiaoyao first? This seems to be a conflict between two children, and I’d like to hear Leng Xiaoyao’s opinion,” Gao Zhongheng said.

The Leng family thought it wasn’t simple, otherwise Gao Zhongheng wouldn’t have brought Gao Qilu to apologize. However, since Gao Zhongheng said to talk to Leng Xiaoyao first, Leng Changyuan didn’t refuse.

Because Leng Xiaoyao didn’t tell them about it, it meant that she could handle it herself, or that she had already solved the problem.

Both Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng believed that she must have solved the problem, and it caused an impact on Gao Qilu. That was why they came and apologized.

“Give Yaoyao a call.” Leng Changyuan said to Leng Yecheng.

“Of course.” Leng Yecheng answered and called Leng Xiaoyao.

At that moment, Leng Xiaoyao was having dinner with Li Mochen. However, when Leng Yecheng’s call came in, she answered it at once.

“What’s up, Uncle Yecheng?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“Gao Qilu and her father came to apologize to you, saying that you had a conflict and she made a mistake. They’re at our home now. What happened?” Leng Yecheng asked.

Upon hearing that, Leng Xiaoyao was shocked. Gao Qilu’s father came to apologize with her?

She couldn’t believe it.

However, she didn’t think that they knew about the posts and their connection to her. After all, she left no traces. She was confident about that.

Then why did they come?

She had told Ling Tianqi not to get involved!

Otherwise, was it just because the Gao family was afraid of being pursued by the Leng family, so they came to apologize first?

In terms of their family background, it shouldn’t be the answer! Either way, it could only mean that Gao Qilu’s family had moral standards.

“I’m fine. Tell them to leave. No need to apologize. Just tell Gao Qilu not to provoke me in the future,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She really didn’t have any plans to pursue this matter further. These scandals were enough to teach Gao Qilu a lesson.

As for the specific reason, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to tell her family. She didn’t want them to worry unless they saw the posts themselves or someone told them. However, upon hearing Leng Yecheng’s question, she knew that they still didn’t know.
