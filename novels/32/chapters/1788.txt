“She also has many famous companies under her name. She’s a talented businesswoman!”

“...”

As people learned more about Gu Ning, they began to admire her.

Because Yuan Shuyan didn’t walk far away and people talked about Gu Ning loudly, she heard their discussion and realized who Gu Ning was.

It turned out that Gu Ning was the top scorer. No wonder she felt her name sounded so familiar and Rong Zechen was so excited.

However, Yuan Shuyan wasn’t envious of Gu Ning at all, because she was born in a dominant family. She wouldn’t admire Gu Ning just because Gu Ning was outstanding.

Even though Gu Ning was a successful businesswoman, she couldn’t be comparable to the Yuan family.

Yuan Shuyan didn’t know everything about Gu Ning, but her attitude wouldn’t change even if she did.

In fact, upon thinking of Rong Zechen’s attitude towards Gu Ning, she got very jealous.

The girl with short hair introduced herself. “Hi, Goddess Gu, my name is Song Miaoge. I live in the capital. It’s very nice to see you today. I hope I didn’t cause you trouble.”

Song Miaoge felt a little embarrassed for interrupting them.

“Of course you didn’t. I should thank you for defending us just now,” said Gu Ning.

“It’s not a big deal. I didn’t do anything important. I just felt displeased when that girl deliberately picked on you,” said Song Miaoge with slight embarrassment.

“Oh, Goddess Gu, may I know your major? I’m studying physics,” asked Song Miaoge.

“Economics, and you can just call me by name,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure, then I’ll call you Gu Ning.” Song Miaoge wasn’t hypocritical. Since Gu Ning said so, she called her that way.

“They are all your friends. I heard you say that you brought them to visit our school. They don’t study in the Capital University, right?” Song Miaoge said.

“Yeah,” said Gu Ning, then she introduced her friends to Song Miaoge.

After that, they greeted each other and began to chat.

Although they didn’t mention their family backgrounds in the chat, Gu Ning could still see that Song Miaoge wasn’t from an ordinary family. In addition, given Song Miaoge’s behavior, Gu Ning knew she was a kung fu lover too.

After a while, they went to the place for enrollment. Because their majors were different, Song Miaoge separated from Gu Ning and they separately enrolled.

Gu Ning and her friends attracted a lot of attention again.

When Gu Ning went to enroll, a senior male student couldn’t help but keep glancing at her. He thought she looked very familiar and he might have seen her somewhere before, but he couldn’t remember it at this moment.

The moment he accepted Gu Ning’s admission notice and opened it to see Gu Ning’s name, he was shocked. He abruptly looked at Gu Ning and exclaimed, “You are Gu Ning?”

Gu Ning?

Many other people who had heard of Gu Ning were astonished too and they all turned to look at her with excitement. Those who didn’t know Gu Ning, however, were confused.

Gu Ning? Is she famous?

“Yeah, I am.” Gu Ning smiled.

“Nice to meet you, Gu Ning.” The senior male student greeted Gu Ning politely and with respect, because he not only knew that Gu Ning was the top scorer of this year, but also knew about her other deeds.

Gu Ning was a person worthy of admiration and respect.

“Who’s Gu Ning? Why is he so excited?” asked someone who didn’t know Gu Ning.

Someone answered his question and it caused another sensation.

“Jesus, she’s the top scorer of this year!”

“She’s achieved a lot more than just that. She started up a company at a very young age, and now she’s a billionaire.”

“What? It’s unbelievable!”

“If you want to know more about her, search for it on the Internet.”

“·······”

Hearing that, many people took out their phones and searched for information about Gu Ning on the Internet.

After knowing Gu Ning’s achievements, they began to talk about her louder and louder. Gu Ning soon became the focus of people’s attention and was surrounded by many people at once.

They kept complimenting Gu Ning, but it was too noisy, so Gu Ning felt a little uncomfortable.

The senior male student understood that Gu Ning was slightly displeased once he saw her frown, so he immediately finished the formalities for her. Afterwards, Gu Ning left and didn’t wait for Song Miaoge.

They were going to go to their dorm rooms after enrollment anyway.

Although Gu Ning and her friends left, other freshmen were still talking about them.

“Boss, how do you feel being everyone’s focus?” Chu Peihan gloated. She could see that Gu Ning felt uncomfortable amid the loud discussions just now.

“You’ll know it once you get famous in the future,” said Gu Ning. It wasn’t pleasant when people paid too much attention to her.

Hearing that, the smile froze on Chu Peihan’s face. She loved acting and was going to join the entertainment industry, but she was unwilling to be surrounded by people everywhere as if she was a monkey in the zoo.

Besides, she must remain kind, or other people might think she was an arrogant celebrity.

All of a sudden, Chu Peihan felt less interested.

“Well, I’m suddenly not that interested in becoming a star now,” said Chu Peihan, feeling upset.

“Why did you lose interest so easily? If so, I’m going to disdain you,” said Gu Ning, but she knew Chu Peihan was just saying that.

“Don’t worry, I won’t give you that chance. If there are more and more people to surround me and pay special attention to me, it means I’m increasingly popular. It’s not a bad thing!” Chu Peihan had ambition again the moment she heard that Gu Ning would disdain her.

As the information about Gu Ning’s achievements was spread abroad, those who were amazed admired her, while those who weren’t began to bad-mouth her.

Some said that she might have played immoral tricks to become successful even though she was a straight-A student and stunning.

Within a short time, there were rumors about Gu Ning.

When Gu Ning walked into her dorm room, there was nobody inside. However two of her roommates already came, and they occupied the two bottom beds.

Gu Ning disliked bottom beds, so she was happy to sleep on the upper bed.

After putting her stuff down, she simply organized it, then left too. However, she ran into Song Miaoge at the landing.

“Hi, Gu Ning, which dorm room do you live in?” Song Miaoge asked Gu Ning the second she saw her.

“Room 508, how about you?” asked Gu Ning.

“No way!” Song Miaoge rounded her eyes in shock. “Me too! I can’t believe that we live in the same dorm room! We’re destined to be friends. I thought I might not be able to see you again, but unexpectedly we’re roommates.”
