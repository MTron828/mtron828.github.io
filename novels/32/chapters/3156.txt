3159 Threaten with a Guilty Conscience?

Actually, they and their subordinates took different routes to the destination.

Normally, Jiang Han and Mu Fan rarely left Li Mochen, unless he ordered them to do something or didn’t want them to follow him.

This time, Li Mochen ordered Jiang Han and Mu Fan to go to City Yun before him.

They arrived at City Yun earlier, so they could arrange accommodation and pick-up.

!!

“Hi, Brother Mochen, Mr. Si.” Upon seeing them, Leng Xiaoyao greeted them. When she greeted Li Mochen, she was very gentle, but when she faced other people, she looked serious.

Shen Xiyin understood that Leng Xiaoyao was going to City Li with her friends this time and dropped by City Yun for her.

However, she was surprised by the outstanding appearances of Leng Xiaoyao’s two friends.

She already had a boyfriend, so she wouldn’t be interested in other men, but she would still be amazed by extremely handsome men.

“Hi, Xiaoyao.”

“Hello, Miss Leng.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Li Mochen and Si Yiqi greeted her too.

“You should go get the plane tickets,” Leng Xiaoyao suggested. She wasn’t in a rush to introduce them to one another.

“Sure.” They answered and immediately went to get the plane tickets.

Because they didn’t have large suitcases and only carried a small suitcase with several changes of clothing, they didn’t have check-in luggage. They went to the ticket vending machine and went through the security check.

Although there were many passengers at the security check, they only waited in line for seven minutes, then went inside.

On their way to the gate, Leng Xiaoyao introduced them to one another.

They were acquaintances, who might not meet again, but they would sit in the same plane and could have a chat.

They at least needed to know one another’s name, but Leng Xiaoyao didn’t elaborate further than that. She only introduced their surnames like Mr. Li, Mr. Si, and Miss Shen.

It was their first meeting, so there was no need to call one another intimately.

Shen Xiyin had a boyfriend, so she kept a polite distance away from other men. She didn’t talk much with them.

They weren’t either talkative, so they were quiet with Shen Xiyin, but talked more with Leng Xiaoyao. After all, they were more familiar with Leng Xiaoyao.

In addition, Leng Xiaoyao knew a lot, and they could learn from her during the conversation.

As successful men, they still felt they could learn from a young girl.

When they were outside, Leng Xiaoyao covered her freckles with make-up.

Therefore, they looked like beautiful couples traveling and attracted a lot of attention. Passers-by complimented them for their outstanding appearances.

Li Mochen, Si Yiqi, and Leng Xiaoyao were already used to it, but it was Shen Xiyin’s first time being the focus of other people’s attention, so she was a little nervous.

However, she knew most people were attracted by Li Mochen and the others so she was noticed too.

After they reached the gate, they sat down and waited to board.

The flight would take off after ten minutes, but a drama happened before they boarded. Shen Xiyin met a familiar face, but it wasn’t a pleasant meeting.

“Oh, Miss Shen, are you traveling with handsome men? Does Mr. An know? Does he allow you to go out with other men?”

It was a sexy young woman, but she was clearly jealous of Shen Xiyin.

Shen Xiyin was displeased at once and replied unhappily. “I just met these two gentlemen at the airport. We are simply taking the same flight. Miss Jin, please don’t spread rumors. I don’t want to cause any misunderstandings.”

She didn’t want herself or other people to be defamed.

An Chenjun knew that she was going to City Yun with Leng Xiaoyao today and was also aware that Leng Xiaoyao’s friends would go with them. Therefore, An Chenjun should trust her even if Miss Jin told him what she saw.

If there was no trust between them, their romantic relationship would be too fragile. She wouldn’t come to work in City Chang for An Chenjun!

Her family was influential in City Yun, so it was a better choice for her to stay in City Yun.

“Ha-ha, why should I believe you? I don’t think you’re telling the truth.” Jin Yiai snorted and refused to believe it.

“Believe it or not, but I’ll sue you if you dare to spread rumors and damage my reputation,” Shen Xiyin said.

Jin Yiai always went against her simply because she had feelings for An Chenjun, but An Chenjun wasn’t interested in her.

Only two of a kind could be in a romantic relationship. Even if a woman had feelings for a man, it didn’t mean the man must accept her.

There was no reason for that!

“Are you threatening me with a guilty conscience?” Jin Yiai believed Shen Xiyin was guilty so she was threatening her not to tell other people.

“You…” Shen Xiyin was angry, but didn’t know what to say. After all, she wasn’t good at arguing, so she only felt aggrieved.

Because Li Mochen and Si Yiqi were also being defamed when Si Yiqi was slandered, Leng Xiaoyao had to say something.

Therefore, she stood up and coldly stared at Jin Yiai. “Miss Jin, you can eat whatever you want to eat, but you can’t say anything you want to say. You slandered Shen Xiyin and my friends are being affected too. I can’t stand slander. So you better apologize to us, or you won’t be able to take the flight today.”

Jin Yiai was scared by Leng Xiaoyao’s cold gaze and tone. She subconsciously got nervous and felt stressed.

She didn’t believe Leng Xiaoyao could do that, so she became even more angry. Even if Leng Xiaoyao put pressure on her, she still retorted. “What? Do you want to beat me? If you dare to do that, I won’t let you get away with it. You must pay a price for that.”

Jin Yiai believed Leng Xiaoyao could only stop her from boarding by injuring her.

If Leng Xiaoyao injured her, she wouldn’t allow Leng Xiaoyao to leave.
