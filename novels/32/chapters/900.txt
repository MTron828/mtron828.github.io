901 A New Girlfriend?

Xu Jinlin was surprised to see Leng Shaoting and the beautiful mature woman by his side.

Isn’t Leng Shaoting’s girlfriend Gu Ning? Didn’t he come here for Gu Ning as well? Why is he holding another woman’s hand? Isn’t he afraid that he’ll run into Gu Ning in Gonghao Hotel?

Gu Ning still looked like “Tang Aining” now, so Xu Jinlin failed to recognize her. Gao Yi and Qiao Ya weren’t with Gu Ning now either.

“Hi, Shaoting!” Xu Jinlin greeted Leng Shaoting, but felt a little uneasy.

“Hi,” Leng Shaoting said.

Xu Jinlin knew Leng Shaoting very well, and he understood that Leng Shaoting wasn’t talkative.

“And this?” Xu Jinlin looked to Gu Ning.

“My girlfriend,” Leng Shaoting replied, but didn’t tell him her name.

“Oh, right.” Xu Jinlin was shocked, but didn’t show it on his face. He wondered whether Leng Shaoting had a new girlfriend right after breaking up with Gu Ning. Since when did Leng Shaoting become a womanizer?

Xu Jinlin was confused.

Seeing Xu Jinlin’s reaction, Gu Ning was amused, but she still decided to joke with him. “What? I am Shaoting’s girlfriend. Is there anything wrong with that?”

“Of course not.” Xu Jinlin denied at once.

“Well, since you’re Shaoting’s friend, why don’t we dine together?” Gu Ning said.

When Xu Jinlin was about to decline, Leng Shaoting opened his mouth again. “Come on, join us.”

He grew up with Xu Jinlin too. Although they weren’t as close as he was to Xu Jinchen, they were still good friends.

“S-Sure.” Xu Jinlin had to accept.

Afterwards, they took the elevator to the fifth floor, but Xu Jinlin kept thinking about Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning.

“Gu Ning, when are you leaving? My father is inviting you to join us for lunch tomorrow in our family’s house,” He Siyin said all of a sudden.

“What? G-Gu Ning?” Hearing that, Xu Jinlin was surprised.

He stared at “Tang Aining” who looked totally different from Gu Ning.

He Siyin gave Xu Jinlin a glance. She didn’t understand why Xu Jinlin reacted so strongly. It seemed like he knew Gu Ning, but was not familiar with her.

In fact, Gu Ning wasn’t in her usual appearance now, so others failed to recognize her.

Before long, He Siyin figured it out, then laughed out loud. “Oh, you didn’t know that she is actually Gu Ning, right?”

“A-Are you Gu Ning?” Xu Jinlin observed “Tang Aining”, but still couldn’t believe it.

Did she disguise herself?

“Ha-ha, I am Gu Ning.” Gu Ning couldn’t help but laugh as well.

“How is it possible?” Xu Jinlin rounded his eyes in shock.

He had been through many shocking things before, but he was more shocked than ever this time.

“There is a powerful technique in the world called makeup,” Gu Ning said

At this moment, the door of the elevator opened, and Leng Shaoting held Gu Ning’s hand, walking out without delay.

He Siyin and Xu Jinlin followed them at once.

“Wow, it’s so amazing!” Xu Jinlin said. He had to admit that he was amazed by Gu Ning’s skill in wearing make-up.

“To be honest with you, I also disguised my features,” Gu Ning said. Make-up wasn’t enough to completely change her appearance.

“I’m short of words now,” Xu Jinlin said.

A while later, they walked into their private room, and He Siyin told the waiter to serve them dishes.

“Why don’t you remove your make-up now?” Leng Shaoting said to Gu Ning. He felt uncomfortable facing Gu Ning while she had another woman’s appearance.

“Sure.” Gu Ning smiled, then stepped towards the washroom.

Once Gu Ning was gone, Xu Jinlin said, “I thought that you got a new girlfriend!”

“It’ll never happen,” Leng Shaoting said with determination, like he was making a vow.

Feeling Leng Shaoting’s loyalty and sincerity, Xu Jinlin was impressed. As Leng Shaoting’s good friend, he also hoped that he could live a happy life. However, he didn’t know much about Gu Ning yet. She was so young after all, and anything could happen in the future.

If Gu Ning broke up with Leng Shaoting, it would be super hard for him to fall in love with another girl. In that case, it was highly possible that Leng Shaoting would stay alone for the rest of his life.

“Has she visited your family?” Xu Jinlin asked.

“Not yet,” Leng Shaoting said, and felt a little upset. “She won’t visit my family until she’s studying in university.”

From Leng Shaoting’s answer, Xu Jinlin sensed that he must be deeply in love with Gu Ning.

“Have you visited her family?” Xu Jinlin asked again.

Xu Jinlin thought that it wasn’t very likely because Gu Ning was still young and her family probably wouldn’t allow her to have a boyfriend at such an early age.

“Yeah, I have,” Leng Shaoting said.

Hearing that, Xu Jinlin was astonished. At the same time, he felt happy for Leng Shaoting because it proved that Gu Ning took Leng Shaoting seriously.

“Are her family supportive?” Xu Jinlin asked with concern.

“Yes,” Leng Shaoting said.

Xu Jinlin was relieved.

Leng Shaoting understood that Xu Jinlin cared about him, so he was very patient in answering his questions.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
