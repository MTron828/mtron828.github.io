Chapter 2868: You’ve Help Me too Much

The two men were also shocked. They didn’t expect Leng Shaoting to be a general. No wonder he could easily catch them.

“A-Are you Mr. Leng of the Leng family?” one of the men asked in horror.

They served the Wang family, so they had heard about high society in the capital and were aware that Leng Shaoting was the only young general in the military.

In fact, they had almost been sent to assassinate Leng Shaoting, but someone else replaced them in the end.

The police actually held doubt, but it went away soon after they heard the man’s question.

“Right,” said Leng Shaoting.

At that moment, the two men had nothing else to say, because they realized it was impossible for them to run away once they were caught by Leng Shaoting.

After all, Leng Shaoting completely relied on his own abilities to become a major general at such a young age.

Afterwards, the police took the two men away. Before they left, Gu Ning gave the police a voice recording of the two men’s confession.

She didn’t care whether the police would investigate the Wang family, but she and Leng Shaoting would.

Although they had the two men’s oral confession, it was only enough to prove that they were guilty. They didn’t want Wang Chongxi to get away with it, because he could just say that he didn’t know the two men.

Therefore, Gu Ning had to find evidence to prove that the two men served Wang Chongxi and that he ordered them to carry out the task.

Nevertheless, it had been two or three years, so it wouldn’t be easy to find out the truth. They needed to be patient.

After dealing with that, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting booked plane tickets back to the capital at 4 pm.

When the other people there learned about Leng Shaoting’s background, they all stood in awe of him.

Shortly after the police left with the two men, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went back to the city, followed by Zheng Peng and his two bodyguards.

The two bodyguards were arranged by Gu Ning to protect Zheng Peng in case anyone wanted to attack him.

It turned out to be the right decision, because someone had indeed tried to attack Zheng Peng during this time, but the two bodyguards successfully protected him.

Back in the city center, Gu Ning received Jiang Wenliang’s call saying that he was willing to work for her.

Gu Ning told him to meet her at XX restaurant. She was going to have a meal there, so they could talk about that then. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Zheng Peng was with her, so she could introduce them to each other.

After hanging up, Gu Ning told Zheng Peng about it. Upon hearing Jiang Wenliang’s name, Zheng Peng said that he had heard of him.

“I heard about what happened to Jiang Wenliang. Jiang Wenliang and Jiang Dashun are cousins, but two years ago, Jiang Wenliang was schemed against by Jiang Dashun and went bankrupt overnight. His wife had betrayed him for Jiang Dashun earlier on and left him for Jiang Dashun after he went bankrupt. However, Jiang Wenliang seems to be a reliable man with standards. His friends have helped him a lot when he’s in trouble, but Jiang Dashun has a relationship with powerful people in City Rui, so Jiang Wenliang’s friends didn’t dare to continue to help him,” said Zheng Peng.

“If he decides to work in your team, pay more attention to the situation he’s in. Jiang Dashun will definitely cause trouble for him again. If it’s necessary, arrange for some people to watch Jiang Dashun. If Jiang Dashun won’t stop, don’t hesitate to teach him a lesson. He isn’t a good man anyway. No need to care about his feelings,” said Gu Ning.

“Sure, I understand.” Zheng Peng answered.

When they arrived at the restaurant, Jiang Wenliang was already waiting there. He couldn’t let Gu Ning wait for him after all.

Jiang Wenliang waited for about ten minutes, before Gu Ning and the others showed up.

Once Gu Ning got out of the car, Jiang Wenliang walked forward and politely greeted her. “Hi, Miss Gu.”

“Nice to see you, Mr. Jiang.” Gu Ning politely replied.

After that, Zheng Peng got out too and Gu Ning introduced him to Jiang Wenliang. “This is the general manager of Colorful Raw Jade Material Mining Company, Zheng Peng.”

Hearing that, Jiang Wenliang was very surprised.

Although this was his first meeting with Zheng Peng, they were peers, so he had heard about him. In addition, Colorful Raw Jade Material Mining Company was very popular these days.

“Oh, hi, Manager Zheng, it’s an honor to meet you!” Jiang Wenliang immediately greeted Zheng Peng.

“Nice to see you too, Mr. Jiang,” Zheng Peng replied.

“Alright, let’s go in for now.” Gu Ning suggested.

After that, they walked inside.

In the private room.

They didn’t rush to talk about business, but ordered first. When the waiter had left, they began to talk about business.

“Miss Gu, I’ve made up my mind. I’m willing to work in your company. I’ll do my best to separate my personal affairs from my work. And I’ll do my best at work too,” Jiang Wenliang said. He understood that he could easily be involved in trouble now. Although Gu Ning promised to help him, he still didn’t want to bother her too much.

“Mr. Jiang, since you’re going to join my company, I’ll protect you if you encounter any trouble, but you must try your best to stay away from trouble. No matter what Jiang Dashun dares to do to you, we’ll take action to make sure that you’re safe,” said Gu Ning. She wouldn’t arrange bodyguards to protect him at all times, but she would pay more attention to him and Jiang Dashun.

“Well, thank you so much!” Jiang Wenliang felt he owed Gu Ning a lot.

“As my subordinate, it’s my responsibility to protect you. I won’t just protect you, I’d do the same for every employee working in my company. It’s very normal,” said Gu Ning.

Hearing that, Jiang Wenliang accepted her kindness.

“As for your job, given your work experience, you can’t be an average employee. I think you can be a middle level manager. It’s up to your abilities how your career will develop. As for what exactly you need to do, Manager Zheng will help you with that,” said Gu Ning.

Jiang Wenliang was surprised, not because he could be a middle level manager, but because Gu Ning ordered Zheng Peng to make the arrangement.

An idea dawned on Jiang Wenliang and he asked, “Miss Gu, are you the boss of Colorful Raw Jade Material Mining Company?”

He knew that Zheng Peng was its general manager instead of the boss, and now Gu Ning asked him to work with Zheng Peng, which meant she might be the boss.
