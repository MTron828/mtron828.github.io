Chapter 444 Jiang Xinyuan

“Miss, thank you so much!” The mother said. Although she wasn’t very hopeful, she still had anticipation.

In the end, the mother entered Gu Ning’s name and phone number into her mobile phone, but didn’t take a picture of Gu Ning’s ID card. She kept Gu Ning’s phone number in order to thank Gu Ning if her father recovered, not to cause Gu Ning trouble if an accident happened.

During their conversation, Gu Ning got to know that the mother was called Jiang Xinyuan. She lived in the capital and her son’s name was Jiang Ziang. Jiang Xinyuan was a single mother, because her husband had died in an accident when she was pregnant, but she had been kicked out by her mother-in-law.

She and her husband loved each other very much, so she had refused to have an abortion. In the beginning, her parents had been furious because she was so young and her life would be tough if she became a single mother. However, she had insisted on keeping the baby, and her parents had finally accepted it. She worked hard to make as much money as possible, while her parents helped her take care of her son.

Although her family wasn’t poor, her parents were both teachers with retirement pay and her monthly salary barely exceeded ten thousand yuan, they could barely afford her father’s high administration fee. She had flown to City B to meet her older brother and his wife. She had wanted to borrow some money from them, but they had refused to meet her.

Her older brother and his wife had been mad at her ever since she had insisted on giving birth to her child after her husband died. They also refused to take care of their parents.

Speaking of that, Jiang Xinyuan wore a wry smile, because the apartment in which her older brother’s family lived now didn’t always belong to them. Three years ago, her older brother had lost a lot of money in a failed business endeavor, and their parents had sold the apartment to pay his debt. The buyer had then rented the apartment to her older brother’s family, but she and their parents were paying the rent. Nonetheless, her older brother’s family never believed their explanation or the truth but thought that they were lying.

Hearing that, Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin had deep sympathy for Jiang Xinyuan, and they all criticized her older brother and his wife, who were totally shameless.

Luckily, Jiang Xinyuan’s father would soon recover after he took Gu Ning’s medicine, and Gu Ning hoped that her life would be better when her father regained his health. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When the plane that Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin boarded had taken off for a short time, Tang Yunfan appeared at the same airport. He was alone and left his secretary to deal with the business in his company. He was flying to City D, to try to get his memory back. He didn’t want to wait, nor let Gu Ning and Gu Man wait, in case any accidents happened.

Standing at the exit of the Capital Airport was a tall extraordinarily handsome young man. Even though he was dressed casually he was still too noticeable to be ignored. The moment he walked in the airport, many people, especially women were attracted to him. Some wanted to approach him, but he looked so cold and seemed unwilling to talk to others, so none of them dared to approach him.

However, one brave woman tried. She was a gorgeous beauty who was around 25. Although she looked calm and confident, she was super nervous in her heart. When she was just two meters away from Leng Shaoting, he suddenly gave her a cold look, and the woman was too scared to move closer. Although she was a little afraid of the man, she wasn’t willing to give up. After a long breath, she said to Leng Shaoting, “Hi, are you waiting for someone?”

Leng Shaoting directly ignored her and turned his head away. The woman felt embarrassed and quickly left.

Seeing that such a beauty was directly ignored by the man, nobody dared to try again.

Gu Ning and the others got off the plane an hour later, and they went to collect their baggage before they walked out together.

Jiang Xinyuan was holding her child, so Cao Wenxin helped her pull her suitcase. Once they walked out of the airport, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting noticed each other at first glance.

Cao Wenxin and Jiang Xinyuan were both stunned to see Leng Shaoting. This extraordinarily handsome man was walking to them! No, to Gu Ning. Cao Wenxin immediately realized that the man had to be Gu Ning’s boyfriend.

“Have you been waiting for a long time?” Gu Ning smiled.

Leng Shaoting gently looked at Gu Ning with a faint smile on his lips. “Not really. How was your flight?” He took Gu Ning’s suitcase.

“Not bad,” Gu Ning said.

“Oh, let me introduce you. Shaoting, this is my Grandpa Tang’s granddaughter, Cao Wenxin. Wenxin, this is my boyfriend, Leng Shaoting,” Gu Ning said to Cao Wenxin.

“Hi,” Leng Shaoting said lightly.

“Hi!” Cao Wenxin said excitedly. She felt that this man had a natural air of nobility and power. It seemed like he had to be an influential figure. And he was so proud and strict, which made others unconsciously keep a distance from him.

Apparently, Gu Ning’s boyfriend wasn’t just a normal military officer. Could he be a young lord of a super powerful or rich family in the capital? Cao Wenxin wondered. However, there was only the top Leng family with the family name of Leng in the capital.

Thinking of it, Cao Wenxin was shocked. Is it possible? Cao Wenxin didn’t believe it, not because she thought that Gu Ning didn’t match the Leng family, but simply because it was impossible. The well-known, dominant Leng family in the capital was too powerful for her to even think about it.

Maybe there are other Leng families. The family name Leng wasn’t uncommon after all. Just like not all the people with the family names Tang or Cao are my family! Within those few seconds, Cao Wenxin thought a lot.

“This is Jiang Xinyuan. We just met.” Gu Ning introduced Jiang Xinyuan to Leng Shaoting.

“It’s so nice to meet you, Mr. Leng!” Jiang Xinyuan said to Leng Shaoting with great respect, like the man was an important figure, while she was just a normal citizen.

Jiang Xinyuan also had a lot of life experience so she knew that the man must be either powerful or rich.

Leng Shaoting greeted her too.

“Miss Jiang, please let me send you to the hospital,” Gu Ning said.

“Oh no, thanks. I can take a taxi myself,” Jiang Xinyuan said. The capital was so large, and it took a long time to get from point A to point B. She didn’t want to bother them any longer.

“It’s fine. We’re going to the Huangdeng Hotel which is close to the hospital. We can give you a ride if you want,” Gu Ning said.
