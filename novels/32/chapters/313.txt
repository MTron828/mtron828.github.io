Chapter 315 I Enjoy It

The housing price in the capital was extremely high and that half-built office building cost at least hundreds of millions of yuan. For those who were rich, they already had their own office buildings so it wasn’t necessary for them to buy another. And for those who wanted to buy it, they couldn’t afford it. Therefore, that building had been in the market for at least half a year without a buyer. However, Gu Ning decided to buy it.

It wasn’t far from the Capital University and the store, so it would be convenient for her to commute between her university and her company. More importantly, it was only two kilometers away from the Tang Family’s company too. Thinking of the Tang Family, there was a touch of hostility that flashed through her eyes. “I think that the third store and this half-built office building are great,” Gu Ning said to Leng Shaoting. Although it was shown in the survey that there was no problem with its quality, Gu Ning thought that it was better if she went to check it herself. That office building cost hundreds of millions of yuan after all.

“No problem,” Leng Shaoting said. He immediately called a subordinate and told them to pay the deposit.

Without much trouble, Gu Ning got the store and office building that she wanted, so she was in a good mood.

Si Ming and Qiu Yuxin both really thought that the other was a great partner, so they went to dine and watch a movie together this afternoon.

They had just met, and it took time to get to know each other well. Neither of them knew whether they would still like each other after they got to know each other a bit better. They weren’t teenagers who treated relationships like a game anymore and their aim was marriage. Therefore, they both took it seriously, no matter what the end result might be.

The next morning, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went to look at the store and office building after breakfast. Gu Ning was satisfied with her choices and they went to buy the office building and rent the store afterwards.

With Leng Shaoting’s powerful network, Gu Ning only spent two hundred million yuan on the office building, which was much lower than the market price. In fact, Gu Ning could also acquire a piece of land from the government and build an office building herself to save more money, but it was hard to find a good piece of land and it took a long time to build an office building.

After she got the office building and the store, Gu Ning went to register a new company, its name was Fenghua Entertainment.

With Leng Shaoting’s help, Gu Ning’s problems were easily solved within days. “I’m so lucky to have you as my boyfriend! You’ve helped me a lot,” Gu Ning said.

Leng Shaoting was happy to be complimented by Gu Ning. “I’m willing to help you.”

“Don’t you think that it’s a bother?” Gu Ning asked. Actually, she thought that Leng Shaoting had helped her too much, and she felt slightly guilty. At the same time, she had to admit that she needed his help badly.

“I enjoy it,” Leng Shaoting said with sincerity. No matter how much of a bother it was, he enjoyed it as long as it could help Gu Ning. Gu Ning was deeply touched, and felt that she was blessed to meet Leng Shaoting who was so considerate and cared about her.

“It’s almost 12 pm. What do you want for lunch?” Gu Ning asked.

“Up to you,” Leng Shaoting said.

Gu Ning took a glance around to see what they could choose.

“There is a restaurant. Let’s go and have a try!” Gu Ning said.

“Sure,” Leng Shaoting replied, and then they walked to the

restaurant.

Since Gu Ning had already settled the store and the office building, her next step was to decorate and furnish them. There was a decoration company under Shenghua Real Estate, so Gu Ning directly called An Guangyao and told him that she had acquired an office building as well as a store. After the New Year festival, An Guangyao would send people to decorate them. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

An Guangyao was greatly surprised by Gu Ning’s efficiency. Luckily, An Guangyao had hired many employees earlier on, so he was able to send a group of people to be in charge of the decoration in the capital. However, before decorating, they had to measure the size of the building and the store. Thus An Guangyao would fly to the capital along with a designer tomorrow.

Leng Shaoting wanted to help Gu Ning, but Gu Ning could handle it herself, so he stayed quiet.

After the meal, Gu Ning said to Leng Shaoting, “Shaoting, if you have anything to deal with, you can leave as you like. You don’t need to keep my company all day.”

Leng Shaoting was upset and felt hurt. “Don’t you want me to be with you?”

Gu Ning instantly explained, “Of course I do. I just don’t want to waste your time in case you have something important to deal with.”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting relaxed. “Don’t worry. I’ll leave if I really have business to deal with, but I’m free now.”

“Great! Then let’s go to the antique street later,” Gu Ning said. The antique street in the capital was much bigger than that in City Teng, and it was highly possible for Gu Ning to get real antiques.

After they left the restaurant, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went straight to the antique street. The antique street in the capital was full of activity and visitors.

Gu Ning walked around it, and got five real antiques in the end. Two of them were worth hundreds of thousands of yuan each, while another two was worth around two million yuan each and the last one was worth over ten million yuan.

“Let’s go to the street of stone gambling now!” Gu Ning said after they finished touring around the antique street. The street of stone gambling in the capital was also very large, but it was still barely comparable with that in City Teng, because City Teng was a base for jade raw materials anyway.

“Does grandpa like jade?” Gu Ning asked Leng Shaoting.

“Yes, but he only likes high-level and top-level jade,” Leng Shaoting said plainly.

Gu Ning beamed and said, “Very well, then I’ll send some top-level jade to him!”

“Great!” Leng Shaoting understood that it was easy for Gu Ning to cut out high quality jade, so he didn’t stop her. Meanwhile, he felt proud of his girlfriend.
