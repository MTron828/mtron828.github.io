Chapter 90: Let Him Search Her Body

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Qin Yifan almost grabbed the package from Gu Ning and opened it at once.

When he saw the jade inside, he was shocked dumb. He looked at Gu Ning. It was so unbelievable! “This-this is Fulushou jade!”

And it was huge.

It was universally acknowledged that Fulushou jade was as rare as the King’s Green. It was too rare to buy one even if you were super rich.

“Yes. I plan to use it to make four bracelets, four pairs of earrings, four pendants, and a wide ring. The wide ring is merely the size of your thumb. And the rest can be made into a few pendants or pairs of earrings,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Qin Yifan took a heavy breath in. “Do you want us to design their patterns?” he asked.

“Yes. As for the jade pendants, one should be engraved with a snake, one engraved with a cow, one engraved with a rabbit, and one engraved with a dragon.” These are the Chinese zodiac signs of Gu Man, Gu Qing, Gu Ning, and Jiang Xinyue.

“In the same order, please carve “Man”, “Qing”, “Ning” and “Yue” on the backs separately. And please do the same thing on the inside of the four bracelets. I’ve already written them down on the paper. As for the earrings, there is no specific request. Just don’t be too common, please. For the wide ring, please carve “Xu” inside. As for the rest of the jade, make whatever jewelry you can make.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Sure,” Qin Yifan answered. He felt like saying something.

Gu Ning noticed, and she thought Qin Yifan wanted help, so she asked him, “Just tell me if want to say something!”

Qin Yifan still felt a little embarrassed to open his mouth, but after a while, he asked, “Do you plan to send the jewelry made from the rest of the jade to others?”

“No, I’m going to sell them,” Gu Ning said.

Knowing that, Qin Yifan was immediately happy. He immediately asked with anticipation, “Could you please sell the rest of the jade to me?”

Qin Yifan wanted to use the Fulushou jade to make earrings and pendants for his mother.

Gu Ning didn’t know what to say at first. She had intended to put the Fulushou jewelry in her shop to attract customers, but since Qin Yifan had asked her, she wasn’t willing to turn him down. With her Jade Eyes, Gu Ning would be able to discover more valuable jade as long as she went to Province Y.

Therefore, Gu Ning agreed, “No problem.”

Qin Yifan was thrilled to have Gu Ning’s affirmative answer.

Except for the part that Gu Ning needed to make jewelry, there was enough left over to make another two jade pendants and two pairs of earrings. Qin Yifan planned to make a pendant and a pair of earrings for both his mother and his elder sister.

Qin Yifan also didn’t charge Gu Ning for the carving. No matter if he was being thankful, or he simply didn’t want to charge Gu Ning, the fee was excluded.

Gu Ning insisted on paying the fee in vain, so she agreed at the end.

Qin Yifan was always active when Gu Ning was involved. He promised that the jewelry would be done after three days.

Three days were more than enough time.

Gu Ning still had classes this afternoon, so she didn’t stay there much longer.

Qin Yifan proposed to send her back, but Gu Ning refused. She didn’t want her schoolmates to gossip.

Qin Yifan understood, so he gave up.

Gu Ning had come here in a hurry and hadn’t eaten yet. She planned to eat at the underground first floor before going back.

It was almost 1:30 pm, and Gu Ning still had enough time to eat.

Gu Ning ordered her meal and it was soon prepared. While she enjoyed eating, a dark shadow sat down across from her.

Gu Ning raised her head. She was shocked when she saw the man.

It was him! Why was he here?

“What?”

Gu Ning was so surprised that she sprayed rice all over the man’s body. Leng Shaoting was immediately displeased.

Gu Ning felt embarrassed. She immediately apologized, “Sorry, my fault. I didn’t do it on purpose. Please forgive me.”

She handed tissues to Leng Shaoting without delay.

Leng Shaoting frowned a little. He took the tissues and wiped the rice off of his clothes.

Luckily, he easily cleaned it up after a few wipes.

“Well, um, why are you here?” Gu Ning asked.

Although she asked the question, she already knew the answer.

Indeed...

“The gun,” the man said coldly and didn’t say anything else.

Gu Ning’s face changed slightly. That man was indeed smart. He knew that she had hidden a gun with her, and he had chased her all the way, but so what? She had already hidden the gun in the telepathic eye space. It was impossible for him to find it.

Accordingly, Gu Ning soon calmed herself down. She pretended to be innocent, “What gun?”

Knowing Gu Ning wouldn’t admit it, Leng Shaoting wasn’t mad, but remained patient. “The man who has been knocked unconscious by you in private room 503. His gun is missing. You must have taken it away.”

“Why must it only be me because the gun is missing?” Gu Ning retorted, although she did take the gun.

“If it’s not you, then it must be the guy who was with you,” Leng Shaoting said.

Leng Shaoting still believed it must have been Gu Ning who took the gun.

Gu Ning was speechless.

She wanted to say that the hotel manager may have taken it, but she couldn’t do it. She didn’t want to blame others for what she had done.

“I didn’t take it. I need to attend my classes, and I have no time to be talking to you. Bye.” Gu Ning didn’t know what to say, so she could only run away. She put on her backpack, walking ahead.

Leng Shaoting didn’t stop her, which surprised Gu Ning. Did he give up?

Gu Ning was wrong. The man didn’t stop her, but followed her.

At the beginning, Gu Ning believed that they might be going the same way, but no matter where she went, he would walk behind her. He was apparently following her.

“Why are you following me?” Gu Ning asked resignedly. Did she have to give the gun back to him?

“I’ll follow you until you give the gun back to me,” Leng Shaoting said.

Gu Ning was speechless again, but she was really reluctant to give the gun back to him.

Although she knew she couldn’t easily get away with it, she wanted to give it a try.

“Since you believe the gun is with me, you can search for it!” Gu Ning stepped forward, like she was prepared for him to search her body.

Leng Shaoting unconsciously stepped back. He frowned a little with a look of dislike in his eyes.

“I said I didn’t take the gun, and you won’t believe it. Now I let you search for it, but you don’t want to do it. So, please stop following me, or I’ll call the police,” Gu Ning threatened him, then turned around walking away.

This time, Leng Shaoting didn’t follow her up. He stood there still watching Gu Ning disappear from his sight.

However, it didn’t mean he already gave up just like that. He simply didn’t want to cause a scene.

Seeing that Leng Shaoting stopped following her, Gu Ning was relieved.
