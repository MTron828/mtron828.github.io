3036 Coercion and Bribery

After Leng Xiaoyao turned on her laptop, she said, “Let me show you how I hacked into the system in Yufeng. You can watch from behind me.”

Yufeng was the largest technology company in City Chang, and was also Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai’s target.

They knew it was too hard for them to reach that level, but it was good to have a target.

Therefore, when Leng Xiaoyao mentioned Yufeng, both Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai were shocked.

!!

Yufeng had the best defensive system, but Leng Xiaoyao said she could hack into it. What if she was caught? It could cause serious trouble!

“Miss Leng, are you sure you’ll be able to hack into the system of Yufeng?” Mu Yufan asked worriedly.

If Leng Xiaoyao was able to do that, they would be convinced by her skills, but the problem was that they doubted whether Leng Xiaoyao could really do it.

“I know you’re doubtful, but let’s see the result,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She wasn’t angry that they didn’t believe her.

After Leng Xiaoyao said that, she immediately worked on her laptop. Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai also didn’t stop her, and only watched.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t hack into the system of Yufeng right away, but gave a glance at the surveillance cameras above them. She moved her laptop aside and avoided the surveillance cameras before hacking.

When Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai saw how Leng Xiaoyao did that with her laptop, they were surprised, because Leng Xiaoyao was very skilled and quick. Even they were barely comparable with her.

A few minutes later, Leng Xiaoyao successfully hacked into the system of Yufeng. She also left a line of words in their system: don’t be nervous, just a trial.

After that, she stayed in the system for a minute till she was found.

Once she was found, she left, so that they couldn’t follow and catch her.

Seeing that, Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai were stunned. If they did that, they would be found before they even hacked in, but Leng Xiaoyao stayed in the system for a minute!

It was amazing!

“T-That was amazing!” Zhou Yunkai exclaimed in shock.

“Yes, it’s unbelievable!” Mu Yufan agreed.

“Although it’s not enough to prove my other skills, it’s enough to prove that I’m familiar with IT. And I can honestly tell you that I’m also familiar with viruses, games, softwares and so on. Due to the limited time, I can’t prove it to you one by one,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Even though they didn’t have much time, what she had just done was enough to convince them.

“Miss Leng, we believe you.”

“Right, you have the ability to hack into Yufeng, which is already beyond our expectations.”

Zhou Yunkai and Mu Yufan were very sincere.

“So, what’s your decision?” Leng Xiaoyao closed her laptop and asked them.

“As long as you’re willing to take over our company, we’ll work for you!”

Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai quickly made up their minds.

“But there is a question I want to ask you. Actually, I’ve read information about the three partners of your company. You’re very good at work. So, I want to know what happened among you? Why did you cut off your close relationship?” Leng Xiaoyao asked. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Hearing that, Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai became angry upon thinking of their friend, the third partner.

“Our friend leaked one of our programs to another company, which caused a serious problem to our business cooperation. We have to pay a large amount of money as compensation now. And he did it for a woman. The woman formed a relationship with him for that purpose, but he didn’t know. He’s been completely fooled by the woman,” Mu Yufan said, curbing his anger.

Leng Xiaoyao thought of Leng Yecheng. Although Leng Yecheng wasn’t trapped by Xi Keyi yet, he had let her touch important files of Fengshang Design because he trusted her, then the important files were stolen.

“How much is the compensation?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“About twenty million yuan, because we need to pay the client and for the following damage,” Mu Yufan said.

“About the acquisition of Fengyang, I’ll give you two options. First, I’ll transfer 36 million yuan to you as the fee. You’ll work for me and I’ll offer you a high salary. Second, I’ll give you 26 million yuan and 20% shares. You can have a high salary and dividends every year. I’m going to invest fifty million yuan in Fengyang, so it’s a great deal if you can exchange ten million yuan for 20% shares. I believe I can manage this company very well, and you’ll get more than just that at that time. As long as you’re loyal to me, I promise I’ll be very generous,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Hearing that, Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai were excited. They didn’t hesitate and chose the second option.

They had seen Leng Xiaoyao’s skills, and believed that she would be able to lead the company to a better future.

In addition, if they had shares of the company, they would work harder.

“Miss Leng, I choose the second option with shares,” Mu Yufan said.

“Me too,” Zhou Yunkai said.

“Great, but if you dare to do the same thing as Jiang Zeshu, I won’t simply let you go. Oh, I also need to tell you that I’m a kung fu master. I’ve learned Chinese medicine too. I can kill without anyone knowing it.” Leng Xiaoyao spoke a little creepily, and scared them.

They were surprised to know that Leng Xiaoyao had learned so many things, including hacking, kung fu, and Chinese medicine.

They were scared because Leng Xiaoyao put a lot of pressure on them.

They didn’t doubt her words, because Leng Xiaoyao’s attitude made them think she was serious.
