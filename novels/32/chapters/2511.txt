Chapter 2514 Too Annoying

Jing Yunyan couldn’t stand it and took action. “Jing Jining, you knew that Jing Yunyao is still alive. Why didn’t you tell my father? What do you want to do? Do you plan to benefit from it when Jing Yunyao comes back?”

Jing Yunyan wanted to beat Jing Jining, but Jing Yanhua stood in the middle and Jing Yanhua was senior to him after all, so he was in awe of him to some extent.

“Since you’re afraid that Yunyao will come and pay you back, why did you have to kill her? You’ll bear the result of your actions.” Jing Jining mocked. They hurt other people, but didn’t want other people to pay them back. It was ridiculous!

However, that wasn’t surprising, because they were never reasonable. They were a self-centered, selfish, and shameless family.

“She deserved it!” said Jing Yunyan.

“Really? Why don’t we go ask Tiandaozong about it? Whether Yunyao really should be killed, and whether her husband in the mortals’ world should have been killed too.” Jing Jining argued angrily.

Hearing that, Jing Yaorong and the others were astonished.

Even though Jing Yunyao made a mistake, she shouldn’t be sentenced to death just because of that. Anyway, even if she was dead, Tiandaozong wouldn’t bother to punish Jing Yaorong for that. After all, there was just news that Jing Yunyao was dead, and there was no solid proof.

Without evidence, Tiandaozong couldn’t do much about it. However, if Tiandaozong learned about Leng Yuanhan’s death, they would surely conduct an investigation.

Although Leng Yuanhan was already dead, they could still get some information as long as they did an investigation.

“Do you have any evidence? If not, stop speaking bulls*it! It’s slander!” said Jing Yaorong. He was guilty, but he refused to admit it.

“You dare to say that because you believe there is no evidence, right? Great, keep on denying it,” said Jing Jining. He didn’t care whether Jing Yaorong would admit it or not, because he knew it was impossible. Actually, he never expected Jing Yaorong to admit it.

“You…”

Jing Yaorong was confused by Jing Jining’s attitude. He also wasn’t sure whether they had evidence of his crimes. Due to that, he was irritated.

“Housekeeper, lock Jing Jining up.” Jing Yaorong was afraid that Jing Jining might leak the information of their meeting. Once Jing Yunyao heard that he already knew that she was still alive, she would be prepared, so he decided to lock Jing Jining up first.

“Yaorong, you can’t do that to Jining. If you lock him up, I’ll immediately go to see the head of Tiandaozong.” Jing Yanhua threatened.

“You…” Jing Yaorong was full of anger. However, being threatened by Jing Yanhua, Jing Yaorong hesitated to do what he just said. “Yanhua, we’re brothers. I’ve been treating you very well these years. Are you willing to see me in trouble?” Jing Yaorong questioned Jing Yanhua. “Or, have you always wanted to replace me?”

He was implying that Jing Yanhua wanted to be the new patriarch of the Jing family.

“Yaorong, I have never had that ambition. I also don’t want to be involved in your matter with Yunyao. But you can’t deprive my son of his freedom,” said Jing Yanhua. It hurt that Jing Yaorong was suspicious of him.

Even after all these years, it turned out that Jing Yaorong didn’t trust him at all.

Did Jing Yaorong think that he was acting all this time?

Fine, Jing Yaorong was always selfish. No matter how well he behaved, Jing Yaorong wouldn’t be satisfied.

“But you son kept it a secret that Jing Yunyao isn’t dead. He’s disloyal to the Jing family,” said Jing Yaorong.

“Why am I disloyal to the Jing family? Just because I kept it a secret that Jing Yunyao is still alive? No one made sure of her death at the very beginning. Since nobody was sure of it, is it strange that she’s still alive?” Jing Jining continued to mock them. “If you have to hurl the blame on me, can you admit that you wanted to kill Yunyao that year? You believed that she was dead. Otherwise why is it my fault that I kept it a secret? How come I’m disloyal to the Jing family all of a sudden?”

“You…” Jing Yaorong was furious. Jing Jining was forcing him to admit that he had tried to kill Jing Yunyao.

However, would he admit it? Absolutely not.

Anyway, it made Jing Yaorong extremely uncomfortable that he was unable to hurl the blame on Jing Jining now. “Fine, he can be released, but he must stay in the cultivation world. Yanhua, since you made it clear that you’re unwilling to be involved in this, please tell Jing Jining to behave himself. If he dares to damage the Jing family’s reputation, don’t blame me for punishing him.” Jing Yaorong could do nothing to Jing Jining, so he could only put pressure on Jing Yanhua. He only hoped that Jing Yanhua would keep it among them.

“Sure.”Jing Yanhua agreed. He did that, not to protect himself, but because he clearly knew that Jing Yunyao would be safe. After all, Jing Yunyao had already reached a high level, and she also had Shangguan Yang’s help.

Jing Jining had the same idea, so he didn’t stop his father. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He could stay in the cultivation world, and he could relax and focus on cultivation.

It didn’t matter whether Jing Yunyao was aware that Jing Yaorong already knew she was still alive. Even if they ran into each other, Jing Yaorong was no match for Jing Yunyao. After all, Jing Yunyao’s level was much higher than his.

Till now, Jing Yanhua and the others didn’t punish Jing Yaorong for hurting Jing Jining. Anyway, it didn’t cause serious damage, and Jing Jining would be fine in a few days.

“Alright, it isn’t early now, so let’s go home and have a meal together,” said Jing Yanhua.

“Sure, what are we going to have? I’m starving. Is there red braised pork and salt baked chicken?” asked Jing Jining purposely, because he knew that Jing Yaorong and the others were too furious to eat anything now.

It was true that Jing Yaorong and the others were too mad to eat anything now, so they were extremely angry when Jing Jining happily said that he was going to enjoy the meal.

After Jing Jining and his family walked out of the yard, Jing Yaorong directly turned and went into his study. The next second, he slammed the door behind him. Anyway, he didn’t want to eat at all.

The others were also furious, but they were hungry, so they still went to eat stewing in anger. Along their way, they kept on swearing at Jing Yunyao and Jing Jining.
