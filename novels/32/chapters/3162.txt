Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I want her to be out of the designing industry. So, disable her hands,” Shen Yamei said. She looked malicious, but actually she was scared. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

If it weren’t for her daughter, Shen Yamei wouldn’t harm Shen Xiyin. After all, Shen Xiyin was her niece, her biological older brother’s daughter, but for her own daughter, she was left with no choice.

Even if she schemed against Shen Xiyin, she didn’t dare to kill her. It was enough to get Shen Xiyin out of the designing industry, so that Shen Xiyin couldn’t steal her daughter’s thunder.

“No problem, leave it to me.” Lu Laosan answered. It was easy for him.

!!

At the beginning, Shen Yamei didn’t ask Lu Laosan to take action by himself because they preferred to keep it a secret. In order to not be discovered, they used a jade pendant.

However, now the jade pendant didn’t work, so she had to ask Lu Laosan to take action.

Before Shen Xiyin came home, she told her family about her arrival.

Mrs. Shen wanted to arrange for a car to pick Shen Xiyin up from the airport so that they could have lunch at home, but Shen Xiyin said she was with her friend and they would go to the city center first. She couldn’t go home for lunch, but she would be back in the afternoon.

After Lu Laosan left, Leng Xiaoyao was still eavesdropping on his phone because she was sure that he would contact Shen Yamei.

Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao heard his conversation with Shen Yamei from the first second to the end.

Afterwards, Leng Xiaoyao was mad, but they were in a taxi, so she couldn’t tell Shen Xiyin.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t tell Shen Xiyin what she heard until they had arrived at the Shen family’s mansion.

Knowing that Shen Yamei asked Lu Laosan to disable her hands after failing to harm her with the jade pendant, Shen Xiyin was furious and her face turned pale in fright.

“W-What should we do?” asked Shen Xiyin. She was an ordinary person, if Lu Laosan wanted to hurt her, she couldn’t fight back.

“Don’t worry, I’ll get rid of Lu Laosan tonight,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She wasn’t worried about that, but she was afraid that Shen Yamei might pay other people to hurt Shen Xiyin after Lu Laosan got in trouble.

Hearing that, Shen Xiyin was relieved.

“But I’m afraid that Shen Yamei might pay other people to harm you after Lu Laosan fails. I think it’s necessary to tell your family. You should threaten Shen Yamei to stop scheming against you,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Although Shen Yamei tried to harm Shen Xiyin, they were family after all. Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t think Shen Xiyin would throw Shen Yamei in jail.

Shen Xiyin would only argue with Shen Yamei and threaten her to stop.

“Sure, but I don’t want my grandmother to know. She’s old and can’t bear it,” Shen Xiyin said. It was hard for an old woman to accept the fact that her daughter wanted to harm her granddaughter.

“Of course, we can only tell your father and older brother. It’s not good if too many people know about it,” Leng Xiaoyao agreed.

Only Mrs. Shen and Old Mrs. Shen were home right now. Shen Xiyin’s father and older brother were still at work.

After Shen Xiyin took Leng Xiaoyao back to the Shen family’s mansion, Mrs. Shen and Old Mrs. Shen were both polite to her.

They asked them several simple questions.

When they heard that Leng Xiaoyao was only a senior high school student, they were surprised. They thought Leng Xiaoyao was the same age as Shen Xiyin! They had that feeling, not because Leng Xiaoyao looked older than her age, but because Leng Xiaoyao had put on make-up and didn’t seem to be an eighteen-year-old girl.

The Shen family was aware of Shen Xiyin’s relationship with An Chenjun and approved of it. Therefore, when Mrs. Shen asked how Leng Xiaoyao became friends with Shen Xiyin under such an age gap, Leng Xiaoyao explained that she was a friend of An Chenjun’s younger sister.

Because she was coming to City Yun to deal with something and Shen Xiyin planned to go home this time, Shen Xiyin invited her to visit her family.

Mrs. Shen and Old Mrs. Shen didn’t look down their noses at Leng Xiaoyao just because she was young. They were sophisticated, and could see that Leng Xiaoyao was more mature and stable than her peers from the way she spoke and behaved.

During their conversation, they found that Leng Xiaoyao was different from other eighteen-year-old girls. They subconsciously regarded her as one of them.

After sitting for a while in the living room, Shen Xiyin took Leng Xiaoyao to her room. It was an excuse. She simply wanted to walk around upstairs to see what they could find.

After walking a round, they found nothing.

It seemed that Shen Yamei had only targeted Shen Xiyin.

It was a good thing that Shen Yamei didn’t target other people.

Before dinner, Shen Xiyin’s father and older brother came home. They politely exchanged greetings with Leng Xiaoyao without any arrogance.

In fact, people with high status like them usually wouldn’t be so nice to ordinary people, even if the guest was their children’s friend.

It really showed that the Shen family had good manners.

Afterwards, they didn’t talk to Leng Xiaoyao again. After all, Leng Xiaoyao was a girl, so it wasn’t right for them to talk to her. Female members of their family could treat Leng Xiaoyao.

However, upon hearing their conversation, they found that Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t an ordinary girl. She looked young, but thought and behaved maturely.

Therefore, Shen Xiyin’s older brother joined them and they gradually turned to talk about business. Leng Xiaoyao was able to express her opinions on all kinds of topics.

In addition, Leng Xiaoyao’s ideas were inspiring and even Shen Xiyin’s father took part in them later.

That being the case, Mrs. Shen and Old Mrs. Shen didn’t know what to say instead, but they weren’t unhappy. Actually, they were surprised by Leng Xiaoyao’s knowledge at such a young age.

“Xiaoyao, I can’t believe you know so much at such a young age. I even wonder whether you’re really a senior high school student,” Mrs. Shen said. She was extremely impressed by Leng Xiaoyao.

“What? A senior high school student?”

Shen Xiyin’s father and older brother were astonished.

Even though Leng Xiaoyao looked young, they thought that she was as old as Shen Xiyin and had worked for one or two years. Unexpectedly, Leng Xiaoyao was only a senior high school student.

If so, she should be about eighteen years old.

There was a big difference between a girl who was eighteen years old and a girl who was twenty-four years old..
