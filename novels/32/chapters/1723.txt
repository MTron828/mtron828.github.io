Chapter 1725: Meet Zhang Zikai

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Therefore, when she was scared, she subconsciously glanced at Leng Shaoting to see his reaction. She didn’t know whether he was aware of it or would ask about it.

However, Leng Shaoting had no reaction and it seemed that he didn’t care about it at all, which made Jiang Shuyuan feel relieved. What she didn’t know was that Leng Shaoting already knew about it from the very beginning, but he chose to listen to Gu Ning and let it go.

Jiang Shuyuan was also afraid that Master Leng might chase her out of the Leng family. She had married into the Leng family for many years, and there was no problem in her relationship with her husband. She didn’t want a divorce. Without the Leng family’s support, her and the Jiang family’s social status would drop in an instant.

Although the Jiang family wasn’t poor, it was only an appendage to the Leng family, and the Jiang family gained more fame and wealth after she married into the Leng family.

If Leng Yuanqian divorced her, either she would be abandoned by the Jiang family or the Jiang family would be greatly affected by her. Either way, it wouldn’t be a good result.

After that, they began to enjoy dinner and every one of them treated Jing Yunyao with enthusiasm. Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Yuanqian, instead, were ignored like they were outsiders.

Leng Yuanqian didn’t care about that, because he had no intention to talk with them. Jiang Shuyuan had the same feeling, but she felt quite uncomfortable in such an atmosphere.

Yu Yin also invited Jing Yunyao to shop together tomorrow and directly left Jiang Shuyuan aside. The two disliked each other and had never shopped together before, so it didn’t matter.

Jing Yunyao didn’t know how to reject it, and she also wanted to leave the Leng family’s old house for a while, so she agreed.

Leng Shaoting then took out a Black Card and gave it to Jing Yunyao. She could buy whatever she wanted even if it cost millions of yuan.

Jing Yunyao thought it wasn’t appropriate, so she turned him down right away. Although Leng Shaoting was her son, she hadn’t gotten her memories back yet, so she was unwilling to spend his money. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

However, the others kept persuading her to accept it and Leng Shaoting also insisted. He told her that he prepared the card for her, so Jing Yunyao took it in the end.

She knew that Leng Shaoting was very rich. Although he wasn’t the richest man in their country, he was almost there, so it was nothing if she spent some of his money.

Jiang Shuyuan, however, was full of jealousy. She was rich too, but she couldn’t buy stuff which cost millions of yuan as she liked. She couldn’t even casually spend over a hundred thousand yuan, but Yunyao could! It was impossible for her to keep the balance of her mind. Because of that, she lost her appetite and didn’t enjoy the meal at all. She made an excuse and left.

Other people knew what she was thinking in her mind, but nobody cared about her.

After she went back to her room, she called Leng Shaoming and told him that Jing Yunyao was back. Leng Shaoming was also shocked when he heard that, and couldn’t believe it. Luckily, his acceptance was better than Jiang Shuyuan’s, and he knew that his grandfather must have accepted the woman if she was really Leng Shaoting’s mother.

Leng Shaoming had an impression of this aunt. He remembered that she was good at fighting and had achieved a lot in the military along with his Uncle Yuanhan. She already had the title of a lieutenant colonel 15 years ago.

Leng Shaoming didn’t dislike it as much as Jiang Shuyuan when Yunyao came back, but he also hoped that she could disappear if it was possible. However, it might be helpful to the Leng family that Yunyao came back.

Even though he was jealous of Leng Shaoting because Leng Shaoting was better than him at everything, he felt that the Leng family needed Leng Shaoting. Without Leng Shaoting, the Leng family might not be able to keep its position, because there were many people who tried to unseat the Leng family. Therefore, no matter how jealous he was of Leng Shaoting, he had never taken any action to hurt him.

Leng Shaoming was selfish, but he also knew what was more important.

...

Gu Ning didn’t go to Shengshi Hotel and share dinner with her friends there. Instead, they went to the food street to have spicy hot pot.

Coincidentally, she ran into a familiar face, which was Zhang Zikai who had participated in the same math competition as her before.

Zhang Zikai was with another two girls and a boy. They were all about 18 years old, but they were arguing angrily.

Zhang Zikai and a girl stood together and she looked very mad, while the girl standing next to her was sad and had tears streaming from the corners of her eyes.

Another girl and the boy stood on the other side. The girl seemed aggrieved, but there was satisfaction hidden in her eyes. She obviously wasn’t as kind and weak as she looked. The boy, however, frowned with impatience.

Seeing that, an idea dawned on Gu Ning that it could be a dramatic romantic story!

She deliberately stopped the car not far from Zhang Zikai and told her friends not to get out right now. She wanted to listen to their argument.

“Boss, do you know any of them?” asked Mu Ke. He knew that Gu Ning didn’t like to watch dramas, unless it was important.

“Yes,” said Gu Ning.

“Which one do you know?” asked Chu Peihan with curiosity?

“The girl in white with a high ponytail,” said Gu Ning. There were two girls in white clothes, but Zhang Zikai had a high ponytail, while the other had short hair.

“Su Tong, I can’t believe what you’ve done to us! We treated you as our friend, and we’ve helped you when you encountered difficulties, but you stole your friend’s boyfriend! How can you do that?” Zhang Zikai angrily criticized the girl who stood with the boy and was in white with short hair.

Gu Ning was right. It was indeed about a romantic relationship!

After what Gu Qingyun had been through, Gu Ning met another drama about it now, it seemed to have become a common phenomenon in today’s society.

She had seen enough of it, and there was more she didn’t see. It was hard to find trust and loyalty among people nowadays.

Gu Ning didn’t care about other people, and she only hoped that her good friends and close relatives could maintain trust and loyalty.

“This girl is disgusting! How can she steal her friend’s boyfriend?” Chu Peihan said in annoyance.

“The boy isn’t a good man either,” said Mu Ke.

“I want to punch them now,” said Hao Ran.

They were all annoyed.
