Chapter 1173 Amid Criticisms

“Alright, let’s go inside now!” Woman B wore a resigned look. She didn’t want them to argue again, so she immediately stopped them.They never got along with each other and argued every time they met one another, but Woman B could do nothing about it.

Woman A didn’t care much about it and went ahead first.

After that, they went into the same café that Gu Ning just entered.

Tang Qingyang was already there when Gu Ning came, because he lived nearby.

“Hi, Gu Ning, have a seat!” Tang Qingyang greeted her with a broad smile.

Gu Ning sat down and a waitress handed her a menu, then she ordered a cup of coffee.

The three women followed Gu Ning inside. They saw Gu Ning and Tang Qingyang.

The woman who was jealous of Gu Ning was displeased when she saw Gu Ning again. She hated Gu Ning for no reason.

Maybe because Woman A had embarrassed her, she blamed Gu Ning for it.

Although she was shocked by Gu Ning’s identity, she didn’t admire Gu Ning. Instead, she was even more jealous of Gu Ning now, because Gu Ning owned so many companies at such a young age.

Gu Ning sensed the woman’s glare, and she was annoyed. She was unwilling to argue with the woman, but she couldn’t tolerate the woman’s unreasonable behavior. Therefore, she gave the woman a harsh look, which frightened the woman causing the woman to move her eyes away at once.

She was scared by Gu Ning.

Tang Qingyang followed the direction of Gu Ning’s look, and noticed the woman’s expression. He cocked his eyebrow and asked, “What’s wrong?”

“Nothing, just a strange woman,” Gu Ning said and shrugged.

Tang Qingyang didn’t ask further and kept on talking about the business.

The woman, however, was reluctant to give in. She felt like she had to do something to release her anger. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After thinking for a while, she took out her phone and signed up a new Weibo account which was named Xue Feifei before she posted something.

Xue Feifei: I saw Gu Ning, the founder of Jade Beauty Jewelry and Charm, walking out of a hotel along with an old man today. They behaved like a couple! I was shocked by her abnormal relationship with that man.

She also @(mentioned) many influential Weibo entertainment accounts.

...

The woman’s real name was Li Xiaoxiao. Because she had no proof attached to this post, nobody believed it.

Some people didn’t want to annoy Gu Ning, so they directly ignored this post, but some still planned to attract public attention by using Gu Ning’s fame.

Gu Ning was already a famous person on the Internet, and her name could help them get more attention.

However, because they were afraid of Gu Ning’s influence, they didn’t leave any comments but simply reposted the message.

Once they reposted it, more and more Internet users noticed it.

Even though Gu Ning was very famous, not everyone was aware of her achievements, so many Internet users jumped to conclusions from insignificant evidence.

Within a short while, Gu Ning’s fans read this post and immediately criticized the original Weibo account that sent the message out.

Gu Ning’s fans were loyal to Gu Ning without doubt, and they knew her very well too, so they trusted Gu Ning and believed that it was a piece of fake news.

Li Xiaoxiao’s Weibo account was amid criticisms afterwards.

As Gu Ning’s fans continued to defend her, more people began to believe that the message wasn’t true.

...

Li Xiaoxiao felt much better when many Internet users criticized Gu Ning, so she was surprised when the situation soon made a U-turn.

As time went by, some aggressive Internet users started to curse her and her family.

Li Xiaoxiao trembled in anger and suddenly hit her phone against the table. It caused a loud sound, which scared Woman A and Woman B.

“Xiaoxiao, what are you doing?” Woman B asked in an unhappy tone.

“I need to use the ladies’ room,” Li Xiaoxiao said and stood up at once.

After that, she left for the washroom.

Other people in the café frowned with annoyance, but said nothing.

...

“Well, I think you should pay more attention to your own safety during this time, although he might not hurt you behind your back again. Your bodyguards are too weak, and I can recommend someone to you if you don’t mind,” Gu Ning said.

It was some kind advice from Gu Ning, and she wouldn’t force him to follow it. She had no intention to take advantage of Tang Qingyang, but Tang Qingyang wasn’t very familiar with her right now.

“Sure, thanks!” Tang Qingyang accepted Gu Ning’s advice. He thought that it was reasonable and he trusted Gu Ning as well.

Even if Gu Ning wanted someone to spy on him, he didn’t mind it, as long as it wasn’t a threat to his life.

He wasn’t ambitious to take over the Tang Organization, he simply wanted to take revenge.
