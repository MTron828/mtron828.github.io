Chapter 1617: It’s Cheesy

“Although they’re my schoolmates, we’re not close. Feng Zi has a good relationship with me, but I’m shocked that he’s such a disgusting social climber! Actually, he confessed his love towards me a few years ago, but I rejected him. I thought we were good friends since then, but obviously I’m wrong. Anyway, I don’t believe it’s just a joke, and I can’t accept it at all.”

Gu Anna was very serious.

They planned to hurt her today and even wanted to take action. If she hadn’t met Gu Ning today or hadn’t had an appointment with Xu Qinyin, she could have fallen into their trap. Gu Anna felt scared in retrospect.

“Ningning, thank you so much for today,” Gu Anna thanked Gu Ning with sincerity.

“Well, I’m afraid what I’ve done will hurt your relationship with them, and I’m not sure whether it’s a good thing,” said Gu Ning. She knew that Gu Anna’s relationship with her schoolmates would end afterwards.

“I don’t care about them, and I don’t lack friends,” said Gu Anna. She was quite disappointed at Feng Zi.

“Oh, Qinyin is already in the movie theater now with the tickets.” Gu Anna received a message from Xu Qinyin on WeChat.

“Great, we’ll be there in 10 minutes,” said Gu Ning.

About 10 minutes later, Gu Anna and Gu Ning arrived at the movie theater, and the film would start in half an hour. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Ningning!” Xu Qinyin was excited once she saw Gu Ning.

“Hey, how about me? Didn’t you see me?” Gu Anna complained.

“We see each other often, and I’ve seen enough of you. It’s hard for me to see Ningning,” said Xu Qinyin.

“Really? Fine, don’t ask me out to watch a film or dine together again!” Gu Anna pouted. “Oh, Ningning came here with me, so we’ll go watch our film now without you.” Saying that, she went to pull Gu Ning’s arm.

Xu Qinyin changed her attitude at once and stopped Gu Anna. “Come on, don’t be mad at me. I’m just joking. You’re my best friend forever, and you know that I can’t live without you.”

“Eww, that’s cheesy,” said Gu Anna with a smile.

“Give me a hug.” Xu Qinyin threw herself to Gu Anna.

“Alright, alright.” Gu Anna gave in.

Although Gu Anna was very outgoing and liked joking, she disliked Xu Qinyin’s lovey-dovey behavior because she didn’t want other people to think that she was a lesbian.

Xu Qinyin knew that very clearly, so she always used that trick to force Gu Anna to give in.

“Ha-ha, ha-ha.” Xu Qinyin proudly laughed.

The three of them were great beauties. Gu Ning was like a pure angel, Xu Qinyin was an elegant lady, while Gu Anna was a sexy woman, so they attracted a lot of attention from passers-by. They were very used to being the focus of people’s attention, so they didn’t feel uneasy at all.

Two good-looking men tried to strike up a conversation with them, but they rejected them. However, they felt that the two men looked a little strange. Normally women came to watch a film together, but it was rare to see men do that. It was like women going to the ladies’ room and shopping together, but men didn’t.

When the film was about to begin, they went inside.

It was a romantic film, and wasn’t very special. They watched it simply to kill time, because there weren’t any popular films these days.

When the film was over, it was already 11 pm.

“Do you want to have night snacks before we go home?” asked Xu Qinyin.

“You can make the decision,” said Gu Ning.

“Let’s go have some! I’m a little hungry,” said Gu Anna.

After that, they went to have night snacks.

Because the night snack street wasn’t far away, they directly walked there, and went to have seafood. It was 12 am when they finished having night snacks.

Gu Anna was going to sleep in Xu Qinyin’s apartment tonight, so Gu Anna left with Xu Qinyin and Gu Ning drove back to Century City alone.

On her way back to Century City, Gu Ning called Leng Shaoting. Leng Shaoting gave Gu Ning a call when they were watching the film, so she sent him a message. Leng Shaoting then told Gu Ning to call him back when she was home.
