3123 Stupid Thoughts

“What did you get in return after bribing them? We have to pay with our savings!” He Fangqi’s wife exclaimed. She didn’t believe He Fagnqi’s words.

“Don’t be stupid, woman. Who told you it’s so easy? I need to do that for the long term,” He Fangqi retorted.

His words made sense, but weren’t the truth and his wife didn’t believe him.

They quarreled for a long while. Luckily, only they lived in this house, so no one could hear them.

Although neighbors heard their voices, they couldn’t hear them clearly because of the sound insulation.

“Oh, if I’m caught, you won’t be able to keep the house under your name anyway. I’m afraid we’ll have to pay much more by then,” He Fangqi said.

He Fangqi’s wife understood that, so she gave in whether she was willing to or not.

However, she couldn’t sleep after losing so much money.

Even He Fangqi didn’t feel sleepy at all.

The next day, when He Fangqi arrived at their company, he paid special attention to the senior management to see whether there was anything unusual.

He Fangqi was most suspicious of them, but he couldn’t see anything different from their reactions. Nevertheless, that wasn’t enough to prove that they were innocent. It was impossible for him to ask them about it, so he had to deal with the houses first.

He couldn’t sell the two houses quickly, unless he sold them at low prices.

He wouldn’t lose a lot of money if the prices were slightly lower because the housing price was increasing all the time. After one or two years, the housing price was already 20% higher. Even though he sold them at lower prices, the prices wouldn’t be lower than the starting prices.

As long as the prices were slightly lower than the current housing price, he could easily sell the houses, but He Fangqi badly needed money now, so he couldn’t sell the houses at a lower price.

Because Lu Changwei was visiting the Leng family to thank Leng Xiaoyao today, Leng Yehua and Song Meiyu also stayed home.

They tried to seize this chance to form a relationship with Lu Changwei.

Although it was Leng Xiaoyao who saved Lu Changwei, they were jealous of her and still wanted to build a good relationship with Lu Changwei. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Lu Changwei wasn’t just the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, he was also sent by a major family in the capital. He had a more unique status than other officials.

Leng Changyuan was happy to form a good relationship with Lu Changwei, so he didn’t say anything when Leng Yehua and Song Meiyu stayed home to treat Lu Changwei.

Although he didn’t like them when they disdained Leng Xiaoyao and treated her badly, he still wanted their family to be powerful.

At 10 am, Lu Changwei arrived with his wife, secretary, and chauffeur.

Because Leng Xiaoyao had rescued Lu Changwei and his chauffeur, the chauffeur came along to thank her as well.

Normally, Lu Changwei’s secretary went everywhere he went, so the secretary was present too.

When the car exploded last time, Lu Changwei’s secretary had been sent to deal with something, so he wasn’t there.

When Lu Changwei and the others arrived, the Leng family welcomed them politely.

They were polite, but didn’t abase themselves.

Although Lu Changwei had a high status, the Leng family wasn’t an ordinary family either. There was a gap between their status, but they didn’t need to feel belittled.

After Lu Changwei and the others came, they repeatedly complimented Leng Xiaoyao. They said that the Leng family was blessed to have such an outstanding granddaughter like Leng Xiaoyao.

Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng agreed on that, so they were very happy when Lu Changwei complimented Leng Xiaoyao like that.

On the other hand, Leng Yehua and Song Meiyu were unhappy when Leng Xiaoyao was complimented, but they didn’t show it in front of Lu Changwei.

Lu Changwei didn’t know about their conflicts within the family, so he was also polite to Leng Yehua when he tried to form a good relationship with him.

Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t mean and wouldn’t embarrass them just because of her grudges against Leng Yuqi. It was good for the Leng family’s future, so she knew what she should and shouldn’t do.

Lu Changwei and the others stayed with the Leng family for half an hour, then left. They didn’t stay for lunch.

Before they left, Lu Changwei gave Leng Xiaoyao his name card and said to her, “Xiaoyao, if you need my help, don’t hesitate to come see me. I might not be able to help you with everything, but I won’t spare any effort to help you as long as I can.”

Leng Xiaoyao had saved his life, and a visit or gifts weren’t enough to return that favor.

Mu Yiyang also told him that Leng Xiaoyao had outstanding skills. It would only do him good if he could have a good relationship with Leng Xiaoyao.

If he encountered trouble, perhaps Leng Xiaoyao would be more helpful than other people.

Therefore, he was happy to form a good relationship with Leng Xiaoyao.

After all, Leng Xiaoyao was extraordinarily skilled, so he should definitely build a good relationship with her.

Mu Yiyang wasn’t just using Leng Xiaoyao, most people were happy to form a good relationship with skilled people, after all, that was how people expanded their connections.

Lu Changwei gave Leng Xiaoyao his name card, but didn’t exchange his numbers with Leng Yehua. Leng Yehua was displeased, but couldn’t say anything.

This wasn’t his first meeting with Lu Changwei, but it was the first time that they had been so close. Therefore, he couldn’t ask for his name card if Lu Changwei didn’t offer it to him.

Otherwise, people would easily notice that he was trying to ride on Lu Changwei’s coattails. It was embarrassing.

After Lu Changwei and the others were gone, Leng Yecheng said proudly, “Yaoyao, I think Secretary Lu wants to form a good relationship with you.”

“How did you see that? Xiaoyao is just a young girl.” Song Meiyu argued in annoyance. She didn’t think so, and believed that Lu Changwei was only polite to Leng Xiaoyao because she had saved his life.

He gave her his name card and told her to turn to him for help when she needed it simply to return her kindness. It couldn’t prove anything!

“Don’t be stupid, woman.” Leng Yecheng mocked. “Xiaoyao isn’t just a young girl. She put out the fire and rescued people right after the car exploded. Who else could be so brave and skilled? I think even firefighters are barely comparable to her.”
