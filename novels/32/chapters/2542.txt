Chapter 2544: We’re Not Strangers

“Bulls*it! I don’t dislike Senior Shangguan at all! Why are you trying to hurl the blame on me?” Jing Yunyan questioned angrily.

Actually, he indeed disliked Shangguan Yang because Shangguan Yang had a relationship with Jing Jining and Jing Yunyao. If it weren’t for Shangguan Yang, they wouldn’t be so afraid of Jing Yunyao.

However, although he disliked Shangguan Yang, he didn’t dare to disdain him. It was precisely because he was in awe of Shangguan Yang, that he stopped Jing Jining from seeing him.

Therefore, he disliked Shangguan Yang, but wouldn’t let Shangguan Yang know. He was reluctant to have a grudge against Shangguan Yang. Therefore, since there were other people with them and they were sent here by Shangguan Yang, Jing Yunyan had to deny it.

“If not, why do you still want to stop me?” Jing Jining asked deliberately.

“I don’t want to stop you, but the patriarch wants to see you,” said Jing Yunyan. He looked serious on the surface, as if it was true.

“I’ve stayed at home for so long, but the patriarch never bothered to see me. Why does the patriarch order to see me right when Senior Shangguan calls for me? Is it just a coincidence?” said Jing Jining sarcastically.

Given the situation, Yang Ping and the others realized that the Jing family’s patriarch didn’t need to see Jing Jining at all, but Jing Yunyan was trying to stop Jing Jining.

They didn’t know why Jing Yunyan wanted to do that, but they chose to listen to Shangguan Yang. Therefore, Yang Ping said, “Please, Senior Shangguan has something important to talk about with Lord Jining. If Lord Jining doesn’t go, Senior Shangguan will come in person.”

“…” Hearing that, Jing Yunyan understood that it would be more complicated if Shangguan Yang came and found out that Jing Jining actually wasn’t busy.

“If so, you can go, but I need to go with you.” Jing Yunyan made the decision when he realized that he couldn’t stop Jing Jining today. If he was present, Jing Jining couldn’t tell Shangguan Yang what he shouldn’t say.

“Whatever you want, but if Senior Shangguan wants you to leave, you can’t blame me.” Jing Jining didn’t stop Jing Yunyan, because he didn’t want to argue with Jing Yunyan right here. It wouldn’t change anything whether other members of the Jing family knew that Jing Yunyao was still alive.

Even if they heard about it, it wouldn’t make any difference. After all, they couldn’t do anything about Jing Yunyao.

Jing Yunyan didn’t know whether Shangguan Yang would ask him to leave in a while, but he had to go with Jing Jining.

Afterwards, Jing Yunyao followed Jing Jining to Shangguan Yang’s residence.

…

Before Jing Jining came, Gu Ning and Shangguan Yang had a tour of the house. It wasn’t very large, but it wasn’t small either. It occupied a piece of land of about a thousand square-meters.

It was a luxurious house in the cultivation world.

Although his house was only one third as large as the residence that the four major families lived in, only Shangguan Yang and a few servants would be staying there. As for the four major families, each of them had at least fifty people.

Shangguan Yang’s house was large enough to accommodate about twenty people.

All the buildings in the backyard had two stories, so there were enough guest rooms.

Although there weren’t many people living with him now, it wasn’t a big deal that the buildings were empty.

After having a tour, Gu Ning and Shangguan Yang went back to the living room. They had tea for a while, before Jing Jining and the others came.

Gu Ning and Shangguan Yang were both surprised to see Jing Yunyan, because they knew that Jing Jining had a bad relationship with Jing Yunyan. It was beyond their imagination that they could come together.

What did it mean?

Gu Ning and Shangguan Yang didn’t think it would be Jing Jining’s idea, so it should be Jing Yunyan’s idea instead.

Anyway, since he was already here, they wouldn’t chase him out.

“Nice to see you, Senior Shangguan.”

“Senior Shangguan, I’m Jing Yunyan.”

Jing Yunyan and Jing Jining went to Shangguan Yang, then made a bow.

“Alright, have a seat!” said Shangguan Yang. Because of Jing Yunyan, he didn’t seem very relaxed.

“Thank you, Senior Shangguan.” Jing Yunyan and Jing Jining nodded, then went to sit at the side. There weren’t any servants, so no one poured tea for them.

“Then we’ll go now, Senior Shangguan,” said Yang Ping. They felt embarrassed to stay longer.

“Thank you for the favor,” said Shangguan Yang to them. He didn’t take it for granted just because he was senior to them.

“Our pleasure, Senior Shangguan,” said Yang Ping, then he left with his companions.

“Jining, this is a very good house. Thank you so much for the effort,” said Shangguan Yang. He was satisfied with this residence so he thanked Jing Jining.

“Not at all. I just gave some opinions and supervised them in finishing the construction. I barely did anything,” said Jing Jining with slight embarrassment. It was true that he didn’t do hard work, since the construction workers did all the labor work.

“Well, it still took you a lot of time and energy. I don’t want to occupy your time to cultivate!” said Shangguan Yang. He felt a little guilty, but Jing Jining was a cultivator in the cultivation world. There was no one who could do this better than him.

Shangguan Yang was unwilling to ask Tiandaozong to build a house for him. He didn’t want to owe them anything, because Tiandaozong wouldn’t accept his money, whereas if Jing Jining helped him with it, he would directly pay him.

Jing Jining wouldn’t take his money, because Shangguan Yang was very close to him. He was willing to do Shangguan Yang a favor. Therefore, he spent the money on buying the piece of land, construction materials, and hiring the workers.

“Senior Shangguan, we’re not strangers. You don’t need to thank me repeatedly. Why are you so polite to me now? It makes me feel as if we’re not close at all,” said Jing Jining, acting aggrieved. He was more than willing to help Shangguan Yang, because it also helped Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting was his nephew, and he wouldn’t spare effort to help his nephew.

“Alright, alright, let’s drop that topic. Don’t hurt our relationship.” Shangguan Yang was amused and stopped talking about that.

Shangguan Yang only talked with Jing Jining, and didn’t bother to pay attention to Jing Yunyan. Jing Yunyan was displeased, but didn’t show it on his face. He had to behave himself in front of Shangguan Yang.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
