Chapter 210: This Isn’t Your Place

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The house price in the capital was nothing like that in any other first-tier cities. It was around twenty thousand yuan per square meter in the suburb, and it could be dozens of thousand yuan per square meter near the downtown.

In a normal city, a land the size of seventy thousand square meters was worth lower than a hundred million yuan, but in the capital, it was worth several hundred million yuan. In a normal city, a businessman could use around a hundred million yuan to build a common living area, but in the capital, it was only enough for a single office building. Therefore, if you planned to build a medium-level living area on a piece of land that was seventy thousand square meters, you had to prepare at least a billion yuan.

“Sure,” An Guangyao answered.

Since Gu Ning could collect enough funds by stone gambling, there was no need for him to worry about the money.

“Uncle Zhou, please start searching for qualified talent these days. When Jade Beauty Jewelry is working well, you can prepare to open other branches,” Gu Ning said to Zhou Zhenghong.

“No problem,” Zhou Zhenghong answered.

In fact, Zhou Zhenghong had also had the idea to open branches because Jade Beauty Jewelry store had made great profits till now, but he thought that they had just opened the flagship store, so he had better take it slow. However, after Gu Ning’s order, Zhou Zhenghong suddenly realized that they could hire and train qualified talent beforehand!

After the meal, Gu Ning told An Guangyao and the others to stay in the Huangdeng Hotel tonight, and they would go back together tomorrow morning. Then Zhou Zhenghong drove Gu Ning back to Clean Water Blue Sky.

When Gu Ning was back in her apartment, she brushed her teeth, and washed her face, before lying in her bed to check their “Family of Fighters” WeChat group.

There were thousands of messages, and many had mentioned(@) her. However, Gu Ning had been so busy these past two days that she forgot to reply.

Many of the messages that had mentioned(@) her all asked where she was and why she disappeared. They of course understood that Gu Ning had her personal affairs to deal with, so none of them had called to bother her, but they had no idea what Gu Ning was doing. Gu Ning was very mysterious to them now.

If Gu Ning didn’t tell them on her own initiative, they wouldn’t ask either.

Gu Ning simply explained to them that she was running a startup, but she didn’t tell them any other details.

Yu Mixi and Chu Peihan were mentally prepared already, thus they weren’t very surprised, but Hao Ran and other boys were astonished. They were also disappointed that Gu Ning refused to tell them more.

Gu Ning then told them that she would be absent from classes tomorrow.

At that time, an idea dawned on Gu Ning. She asked them to send her their Chinese zodiac signs. However, she still didn’t tell them what it was for.

Gu Ning decided to send each of them a gift. After that, she sent a message to Zhou Zhenghong booking jade pendants in the shape of her friends’ Chinese zodiac signs. All the jade pendants were made from medium-high-level jade, and were carved with her friends’ name.

Except for the jade pendant in a rabbit’s shape with “Han” carved on it, they all had to be sent back to her before the next Friday, the rest could be made slowly.

...

Gu Ning and the others’ flight would take off at 9:50 am, and Zhou Zhenghong came to pick Gu Ning up around 8 am.

However, before they headed to the airport, Gu Ning went to the Jade Beauty Jewelry store first. She wanted to bring An Qian a gift to thank her for when she had taken good care of Gu Man.

An Qian wouldn’t accept the administration fee, so Gu Ning could only send her a gift. Although the administration fee wasn’t much, Gu Ning valued their friendship above money. Thus she prepared a gift of a jade pendant which was worth 280 thousand yuan for An Qian. It was a jade pendant of the hibiscus type in the shape of a leaf as wide as a woman’s thumb.

At 8:20 am, An Guangyao and the others climbed into an exclusive car arranged by the hotel, leaving for the airport to meet Gu Ning. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Gu Ning arrived at the airport at 9:10 am. She checked in, walking into the lounge, and met An Guangyao. Ten minutes later, they went aboard.

Gu Ning had booked the plane ticket herself, so their seats weren’t adjacent to each other.

While Gu Ning was on the plane flying back to City F, something happened in Kamei Beauty Salon at the same time.

Lin Lijuan needed to attend a classmates gathering this afternoon, so she went to get skincare done this morning.

However, to her surprise, she met Gu Man and Gu Qing. Both of them were dressed elegantly and looked totally different now.

Both Gu Qing and Gu Man had been beautiful girls when they had been young, but what had happened in their miserable lives had aged them fast. However, their lives were completely different now. Although they weren’t young anymore, they were still elegant and charming after comprehensive care. What they had been through only accentuated their beauty.

“Why are you here?” Lin Lijuan asked acidly. She was jealous. She knew that they must be here for skincare, but she refused to believe that they could afford it.

Seeing Lin Lijuan, both Gu Man and Gu Qing were unhappy. Although they knew that Lin Lijuan was a VIP in Kamei Beauty Salon, it was still upsetting to meet her.

“Why can’t we be here? This isn’t your place,” Gu Qing argued.

“How could you possibly afford it?” Lin Lijuan questioned with doubt. She had already noticed that Gu Qing and Gu Man were wearing fashionable clothes, and their skin had apparently improved a lot, but she still couldn’t believe it.

“What? You can’t stand the fact that we’re rich now?” Gu Qing asked sarcastically.

“Gee! I know how poor you are; you can’t be rich all of a sudden!” Lin Lijuan said. In her eyes, Gu Qing and Gu Man should be dirt poor throughout their entire lives.

“Why can’t we be rich? Our eldest brother, your husband, was poor in the very beginning too!” Gu Qing retorted.

After a second, Gu Qing added, “And, whether we’re rich or not has nothing to do with you!”

“You...” Lin Lijuan was mad, but she couldn’t help being curious about their situation now.

“Who is so rude that they dare to pick on the bosses here?”

At that time, a female voice sounded from outside the door.

If Gu Ning had been here, she would easily have recognized the woman by her voice even before seeing her face.
