Chapter 1086 Baili Zongyang

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting wandered on the street, then noticed Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua by accident in a nearby restaurant. Gu Ning had doubts that they might be practicing their inner discipline, so she wanted to find out more about them.Therefore, Gu Ning said to Leng Shaoting, “Shaoting, I think the man and the woman over there could be those who are practicing their inner discipline. Why don’t we go have a seat with them to see if we can find out more about them?”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was surprised.

They had just met another man of the Evil Practice yesterday, and they met those who were practicing inner discipline today?

Leng Shaoting trusted Gu Ning. Since Gu Ning thought it was very likely, he believed so.

“No problem,” Leng Shaoting said.

Afterwards, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting walked into the restaurant.

The table next to Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua was vacant, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting sat there.

Once they walked inside, Dongfang Ziyu saw them and recognized them.

However, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting pretended that they didn’t see them, and ordered two cups of coffee.

Dongfang Ziyu was attracted to Leng Shaoting’s outstanding appearance like every normal woman, but she did nothing to bother him.

“Ziyu, look at the young man at the next table. He’s even more handsome than Baili Zongyang! He also has an air of power and nobility. I guess he must be a member of the high society in this world,” Wu Shunhua said all of a sudden.

Although Leng Shaoting was much more attractive than him, Wu Shunhua wasn’t jealous of him. He wasn’t a mean person after all.

Wu Shunhua didn’t say it loudly, but Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning were still able to hear it.

Gu Ning immediately verified that they came from the cultivation world, because only people from the cultivation world would differentiate themselves from common human beings.

The person named Baili Zongyang that he just mentioned must be a member of the cultivation world too.

“Yeah, he indeed is more handsome than Baili Zongyang, but unfortunately he’s just a common human,” Dongfang Ziyu said.

They were totally different from common humans. In their eyes, a common human was inferior to them no matter how powerful or rich he was.

Just like how gods and goddesses looked at common human beings, they all believed that they were superior to them.

“Oh, right, why don’t you like Baili Zongyang? I think he’s a quality man,” Wu Shunhua asked.

The Baili family was one of the four dominant families in the cultivation world, and it was actually more influential than the Dongfang family. Baili Zongyang was universally acknowledged as an outstandingly handsome young man, and he was also the sole heir of the Baili family. Countless women were attracted to him.

Nevertheless, Baili Zongyang only liked Dongfang Ziyu, but Dongfang Ziyu didn’t like him, which Wu Shunhua couldn’t understand.

“Well, I simply don’t like him no matter how understanding he is. In addition, he chases me just because he thinks that I’m the only woman who matches him. He doesn’t really like me, and he’s a self-centered person,” Dongfang Ziyu said. “Alright, let’s go now.”

Dongfang Ziyu didn’t want to talk about it. In fact, she did admire Baili Zongyang before, because he was too outstanding to be ignored in the cultivation world. However, when she found out the real reason why he chose her, she didn’t like him anymore.

Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua left after they finished their meal, while Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s coffee was just placed on the table.

“Shall we follow them?” Leng Shaoting asked.

“No need. We’ll see them again at the auction tomorrow,” Gu Ning said.

Since they weren’t common humans, it wouldn’t be easy to follow them without being found out.

That being the case, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting enjoyed their coffee in the restaurant.

Because of Leng Shaoting’s outstanding appearance, many girls paid attention to him, but none of them came over to strike up a conversation with him, so Gu Ning didn’t mind it. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After finishing their coffee, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting went back to the hotel.

Gu Ning received Master Leng’s call on the way.

“Hi, Girl Gu, how are you doing in Burma? Is Shaoting taking good care of you?” Master Leng said the second Gu Ning answered his call.

Gu Ning felt touched that Master Leng cared about her.

“Grandpa Leng, I’m well, and Shaoting is taking good care of me. We’re good in Burma,” Gu Ning said.

“Great!” Master Leng laughed with happiness.

Leng Shaoting felt a little upset that Master Leng only cared about Gu Ning and didn’t ask about him, but at the same time, he also felt happy that his grandfather liked his girlfriend.

After hanging up the call with Master Leng, Gu Ning joked, “Are you jealous of me?”

Leng Shaoting squeezed Gu Ning’s hand. “Not at all.” In Leng Shaoting’s eyes, Gu Ning was more important than himself.

Gu Ning beamed, and said nothing.

...

In the capital, Master Leng called Tang Haifeng next.

Tang Haifeng was having a walk in the yard when his phone rang. He was surprised to see the caller’s name.

He thought that Master Leng must have found out about Gu Ning’s relationship with Leng Shaoting, and wondered what Master Leng would say about it.
