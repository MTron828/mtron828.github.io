As long as there was no evidence to prove it was done by him, Zhan Zhiyin could do nothing to him.

“Do you think I don’t know what to do with you if you deny it? If you admit it, you may just be punished by the law. You’ll only spend a few years in jail. But if you refuse to tell me the truth, I’ll kill you right now and no one will know,” said Zhan Zhiyin disdainfully, putting pressure on Chen Yunheng causing him to feel very stressed.

Besides, Zhan Zhiyin showed a strong intention to kill on her face, which scared Chen Yunheng. He wasn’t sure whether Zhan Zhiyin really meant it.

He didn’t believe she would dare to kill people without careful thinking, but despair gave courage even to a coward.

Therefore, Chen Yunheng was still very frightened because he didn’t want to die.

However, he was unwilling to admit it, so he chose to be silent for the time being.

“What? Do you think I’m just scaring you?” Zhan Zhiyin asked when he fell silent.

“Don’t think you can get away with it if you dare to kill me. The police will catch you sooner or later.” Chen Yunheng tried to threaten Zhan Zhiyin and hoped she could give up the idea of killing him.

“So? I don’t care. I just want you to pay the price for scheming against Leng Shaoming,” said Zhan Zhiyin aggressively. Without hesitation, she drew a dagger from her waist. Stepping towards Chen Yunheng, she seemed ready to kill at any moment.

“S-S-Stop!” Chen Yunheng stumbled back in fear, but there was no room behind him. He hit the wall after a simple step back.

Chen Yunheng wanted to shout for help, but he knew that she would pinch his cheeks again if he did that.

And what if he angered her by shouting for help? She might directly kill him!

“I can give you one last chance. Are you going to admit it or not?” Zhan Zhiyin’s dagger drew closer and closer to Chen Yunheng.

“I-I didn’t…” Chen Yunheng still denied it.

“If so, go to hell!” Zhan Zhiyin made up her mind and stabbed Chen Yunheng in his chest.

She wouldn’t hesitate to injure him, but she wouldn’t really kill him. Although she disguised herself as someone else, she was still reluctant to kill. After all, she had no right to deprive Chen Yunheng of his life.

“I admit it!” Seeing that the dagger was about to stab into his chest, Chen Yunheng immediately gave in. He didn’t expect her to really kill him.

The moment Chen Yunheng yielded, Zhan Zhiyin stopped, the dagger already touched his chest. If he was a second later, the dagger would be stabbed into his chest.

Chen Yunheng broke out in a cold sweat and felt that he had good luck.

“Tell me what you did.” Zhan Zhiyin didn’t move the dagger away, instead she pressed it against Chen Yunheng’s chest.

Chen Yunheng didn’t come back to his senses until he heard Zhan Zhiyin’s voice. He took a deep breath and said, “I-I ordered Wu Ming to knock into Leng Shaoming’s car, but I’m not the mastermind. The mastermind is the Yuan family. It was the Yuan family’s orders.”

Chen Yunheng was unwilling to die for the Yuan family.

If he confessed, he would just be an accessory, not the mastermind and his punishment would be much lighter. He would only be sentenced to four or five years in jail and could still live a good life after coming out, but he would lose everything if he died right now.

Zhan Zhiyin was struck dumb for a second. She thought that Chen Yunheng was the mastermind, but unexpectedly the mastermind was someone else.

However, she wasn’t sure whether it was true.

“The mastermind is the Yuan family? Didn’t you order someone to knock into Leng Shaoming’s car because your father was arrested due to his report?” asked Zhan Zhiyin.

“No, I did have that idea, but didn’t dare to do it because I didn’t want to get in trouble as well. The Yuan family’s people came to see me. They threatened and bribed me, so I agreed to help them,” said Chen Yunheng sincerely. He wanted to win Zhan Zhiyin’s trust. After all, there was a huge gap between the mastermind and the accessory.

“Do you have evidence? If not, I can’t believe your words,” said Zhan Zhiyin, but she was actually already convinced to some extent. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Although she wasn’t born in the capital and barely knew about the situation there, she was aware that the four major families were enemies. They always schemed against each other. In order to seize power, they played all kinds of tricks.

If the mastermind was the Yuan family, the Chang family, or other families, Zhan Zhiyin wouldn’t be surprised, but Zhan Zhiyin wouldn’t think it must be one of them just because they were likely to be guilty.

Perhaps there were other families who were trying to frame the Yuan family!

She wasn’t defending the Yuan family, but schemes were usually complicated.

“They told me that they’re from the Yuan family,” said Chen Yunheng.

“That can’t prove anything. They could have lied to you by saying they’re from the Yuan family. Tell me how you contact them? Where did you meet? The person’s age, gender, features and your conversation? If you can’t tell me all the above, I can’t believe you,” said Zhan Zhiyin.

“It’s a man and he directly stopped me in the underground parking lot of my house. We had a conversation in my car. He was wearing a baseball cap and a mask. I couldn’t see his face. He told me he knew my father was put in jail because of Leng Shaoming’s report, so he offered me a chance to take revenge. I didn’t agree at the beginning because I was unwilling to go against Leng Shaoming. I didn’t want to end up in trouble. But the man told me that he’s a member of the Yuan family and could protect me. So I went to see Wu Ming, but Wu Ming failed. I could only ask Wu Xiaoli to drug Leng Shaoming. Unfortunately, both of them failed…” said Chen Yunheng.

“What else?” asked Zhan Zhiyin.

“Nothing else,” said Chen Yunheng.

“Isn’t there any way to contact them?” asked Zhan Zhiyin.

“No, because I’ve not done anything successfully, so I didn’t contact him,” said Chen Yunheng.

Looking at Chen Yunheng’s sincere face, Zhan Zhiyin believed that he wasn’t lying, but she needed to further investigate to know whether the mastermind was really the Yuan family.
