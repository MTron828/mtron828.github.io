Chapter 359 Back to City F

While Allan was walking away, Bai Xueyan was absorbed in his back. She didn’t get her mind back until Allan disappeared from her sight. She asked Gu Ning, “Isn’t he handsome? He’s such a gentleman!”

“Yes, he’s handsome and polite.” Gu Ning couldn’t deny it, but she still believed that Leng Shaoting was better looking than Allan. Thinking of Leng Shaoting, Gu Ning missed him so much.

“Especially when he smiles! It’s so stunning!” Bai Xueyan looked like she fell in love, which amused Gu Ning. After a while, Bai Xueyan and Gu Ning left the café. However, Allan didn’t show up again when they left, and Bai Xueyan was slightly disappointed. Gu Ning felt sorry for her but didn’t know how to comfort her.

The two separated when they walked out of the café. Bai Xueyan invited Gu Ning to dine with her family in the Bai Family’s house, but Gu Ning declined.

Gu Ning later called Qiao Ya and asked her about the company in City Teng. Qiao Ya said that everything was fine. Then Gu Ning told them to fly to City F tomorrow.

In the following hours, Gu Ning was free, so she went to the processing plant afterwards. When it was almost 6 pm, people were getting off from work, so Gu Ning left too. She went to a restaurant to have her dinner alone. During the meal, she noticed that Qin Zixun invited them to gather together on their WeChat group.

Mu Ke: Will your parents allow you to hang out?

Qin Zixun: They couldn’t stop me anyway, because they aren’t home and went to City G for a funeral.

Hao Ran: Who died?

Qin Zixun: The daughter of one of my father’s friends. She attended my uncle’s birthday party too. I heard that she was hit by a beer bottle in a nightclub.

Qin Zixun didn’t know the details.

Reading that, Gu Ning immediately figured out that the person must be Li Zhenzhen. Li Zhenzhen is dead? Gu Ning was greatly surprised. After thinking for a while, Gu Ning assumed that she must have died because of the drugs instead of the injures to her head. Although Gu Ning didn’t hate Li Zhenzhen to death, she had no sympathy for her, because she deserved it. Gu Ning went back to Clean Water Blue Sky after the meal.

In the evening, Gu Ning received a message from K. He had already sent what she requested to her email box. Gu Ning opened her email box and checked the email.

Gu Ning had asked K to help her investigate medical companies which were barely afloat in the capital. K had found three of them along with their history, background, reputation and other related information. Gu Ning chose the first one, but she didn’t have time to go to the capital again, and could only wait until after the New Year festival. She thought that it wouldn’t be acquired that soon.

The next morning, Gu Ning flew back to City F without delay. Her plane took off at 9:30 am and she arrived at City F’s airport at 10:40 am. The moment that she got off the plane, she called Gu Man and asked where she was.

Gu Man was at the beauty salon, so Gu Ning took a taxi heading straight there. Gu Man was really happy that Gu Ning was back. She kept running out to see whether Gu Ning was back.

“Man, I understand that you’re excited that Ningning is back, but you don’t need to check outside all the time! Ninging just left for half a month this time. When she goes to college, she will only come back once a semester!” Gu Qing said.

Actually, she was also worried about Gu Ning during the half month when Gu Ning was gone. No matter how successful Gu Ning was, she was still a child in her family’s eyes. Her family certainly would care about her. Thus Gu Qing was also happy that Gu Ning was back soon.

“Nevertheless, she doesn’t go to college yet!” Gu Man said.

It took 20 minutes of driving from the airport to the downtown, so Gu Ning arrived at the beauty salon around 40 minutes later. Once Gu Ning walked inside, Gu Man and Gu Qing went forward to welcome her. “Ningning, welcome back!”

Gu Qing took the suitcase from Gu Ning’s hand, while Gu Man held Gu Ning’s hand walking to the office.

When they were in the office, Gu Ning opened her suitcase. “These are your New Year gifts!”

“We already have enough clothes. You didn’t need to do that,” Gu Man said, but she felt happy in her heart. Nobody would be unhappy to receive gifts.

Gu Ning smiled gently, but she couldn’t tell them that these were gifts from her son-in-law-to-be. If they knew that she had a boyfriend, they would ask for every detail.

Afterwards, Gu Ning took out three jewelry boxes and gave it to Gu Man. “These are the three jade pendants for your event.”

Gu Qing looked at the three jewelry boxes. She wanted to say something but didn’t say it, because she still thought that it was too expensive. Gu Ning noticed that and comforted her, “Aunt, I know they’re expensive, but no pain, no gain!”

Hearing that, Gu Qing remembered that many VIPs had called to ask about the prize yesterday, which proved that it was indeed attractive, so she relaxed.

“Alright, it’s almost 11:30 am. Let’s go dine together! What do you want to have, Ningning?” Gu Man checked the time and asked Gu Ning.

There was a kitchen in their beauty salon, and staff could cook and eat here, but Gu Man wanted to have a family reunion, so they decided to eat outside.

“Let’s have hot pot! It’s winter anyway,” Gu Ning said.

“No problem, let’s go have hot pot!” Gu Man agreed. The three of them went out afterwards.

“Aunt, how is uncle’s business doing?” Gu Ning asked Gu Qing

“I don’t know the details, but it’s quite good! There is deal coming in almost every day,” Gu Qing smiled. They had been dirt poor and now had everything. Gu Qing couldn’t help thinking that life was indeed full of changes. And Gu Ning made everything possible.

“Oh, I received a call from your youngest uncle this morning. They’ll be back the day after tomorrow, and want to have a family reunion with us. I didn’t answer him yet, because I wanted to hear your opinion,” Gu Qing said and looked to Gu Ning. In fact, she just needed Gu Ning’s opinion.

Gu Ning was silent for a second. She understood that Gu Man and Gu Qing were willing to go. Otherwise, they wouldn’t ask her. In addition, there was no deep grudge between them and Gu Qinyang’s family, so it was no big deal that they had a meal with them.

“I don’t think that it’s a big deal. There is no deep grudge between us and my youngest uncle’s family either. It isn’t necessary that we keep a long distance from them. However, let’s be candid here, if the old witch and Gu Qinxiang’s family annoys me again, I won’t be polite to them. And they will have to leave, instead of me,” Gu Ning said seriously. “I understand,” Gu Qing replied. They weren’t weak like they had been before, and they had already had enough of them, so there was nothing to be afraid of.
