Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Then, they also went to row a boat

The woman’s admirer felt uncomfortable after knowing that she also liked Leng Shaoming, because she never gave him a clear answer and he thought he had a chance. She made him feel that there was chemistry between them, and that she would accept him sooner or later, but unexpectedly, she already knew who she really liked.

Since she already found who she liked, why didn’t she tell him? What did she mean? Was he just a back-up?

He believed Chen Siyu’s words because it was obvious that the woman really liked Leng Shaoming.

Out of anger, he deliberately stayed away from her when they went to row a boat.

Before today, he always followed behind her and people might even think they were a couple.

The woman was depressed when her admirer kept a distance away from her, and it was all caused by Chen Siyu.

Although she didn’t accept him, she had a good impression of him. That was the reason why she didn’t directly reject him.

If she didn’t have a better choice, she would accept him.

Therefore, she felt he wasn’t tolerant by staying away from her just because of Chen Siyu’s words.

Since he liked her, he should be tolerant. If he was afraid that she might be stolen away by another man, he should treat her better!

Besides, she just liked Leng Shaoming, but she hadn’t confessed her affection for him. Why was he mad at her?

Selfish people only thought about themselves and didn’t allow other people to do anything to upset them. They always blamed other people for their own faults.

The woman was unhappy that the man stopped chasing her just because of that, so she directly went up and pulled the man. “Come here, I need to talk with you.”

The man put on a cold expression, but agreed.

He was angry, but he didn’t lose hope yet. After all, it wasn’t easy for him to give up on the girl he liked.

Therefore, if she could give him a reasonable explanation, he would get over it.

After that, the man followed the woman to the side.

“Ha!” Chen Siyu disliked the woman’s behavior of keeping a plan-B, but she said nothing. It wasn’t her business, so she just sneered.

When the man followed the woman to the side, the woman said, “Do you believe Chen Siyu?”

“Isn’t it true?” asked the man. Obviously, he believed it.

“Of course not! There is a huge gap between my and Leng Shaoming’s status. Do you think I have no self-awareness? Well, I admit I have some affection for him, but it’s just appreciation. After all, he’s very handsome and was born in a powerful family. Is that my fault?” said the woman.

Hearing that, the man accepted her explanation. Frankly, he also had appreciation for outstanding women!

Therefore, the man felt better.

However, there was one important question he needed to ask her. “I’ve chased you for two months. Why didn’t you give me a clear answer?”

“Don’t you have any patience? Girls need time to observe their admirers. Why can’t you give me more time to think about it? If I easily accept you, we might also break up easily. We need more time to get to know each other.” The woman argued, taking it for granted.

The man was convinced. If a woman easily accepted him, he might lose interest in her.

So the man said nothing and they went back to normal.

“Sorry, I was a little intolerant.” The man apologized. After all, he really liked this woman, so his anger went away after hearing her explanation. In order not to anger her, he made an apology.

“Alright, I just don’t want to be misunderstood,” said the woman. She was relieved that the man wasn’t mad at her any longer.

Although she had many admirers, this man was her best choice till now, so she was very likely to choose him.

…

At that time, Leng Shaoming had already set out.

The boat they were riding was a pedal boat, so they moved it forward with their feet.

There were also electric ones, which were generally provided for those who didn’t want to pedal, but since they were out to have fun, pedaling was more interesting.

The pedal boat had multiple seats and double seats. Leng Shaoming and Zhan Zhiyin rented one with two seats.

There was a small table in front of their seats. On the small table was a plate of snacks, a plate of fruit and two bottles of juice.

This lake wasn’t very big, but it wasn’t too small either. It was the size of a football field.

There was a circular forest trail around the lake, where people could walk and run, and the air was very refreshing.

If they had enough money, they could have a good vacation here.

“The scenery here is impressive,” Zhan Zhiyin said.

Because Zhan Zhiyin was originally a monster fox and had stayed in the snow-capped mountains all year round, she liked this kind of wilderness and beautiful scenery far away from the bustling city.

Deep down in her heart, she still liked this kind of tranquility, where there were mountains, water, and woods.

“Yeah! My friend owns this place, but it didn’t open until last week. That’s why when you came to see me previously I didn’t bring you here,” Leng Shaoming said.

“The services here should be very expensive!” Zhan Zhiyin said, but it couldn’t be more obvious.

“Yeah, but it’s acceptable,” said Leng Shaoming.

As they chatted, neither of them brought up what happened earlier. Zhan Zhiyin was a little upset, because she wasn’t sure whether Leng Shaoming really took her as his girlfriend.

Leng Shaoming didn’t bring it up, because he wanted to talk about that a bit later.

The two of them rowed for about an hour, then they returned to the shore because it was almost 12 pm so it was time for lunch.

Back in the hall, the manager immediately came to collect them. Then he guided them to the private room in person.

When they were left alone in the private room, Leng Shaoming asked Zhan Zhiyin to wait for a while, then he stood up to get something from the cabinet.

Before long, he took it out and Zhan Zhiyin was struck dumb the moment she saw it.

It was a large bunch of red roses.

What did it stand for?
