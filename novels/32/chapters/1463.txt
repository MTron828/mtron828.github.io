Chapter 1464: The Death of Leng Shaoting’s Mother

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

In his memories, his mother loved taking notes and keeping recording everything funny that he did.

At this time, Gu Ning began to read the two books. Although she knew little about cultivation, she thought that these two books might help Leng Shaoting with it. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Leng Shaoting was a junior cultivator now, and he needed to learn much more to reach a higher level.

Gu Ning read very fast, and she finished reading the two books within 20 minutes. Although she didn’t understand their content, she still needed to remember them and study them, because it might be helpful for Leng Shaoting.

A short while later, Leng Shaoting found Yunyao’s notebook.

“It is her handwriting!” Leng Shaoting made sure of it after flipping the notebook.

Gu Ning compared the handwriting on Yunyao’s notebook and that on the transcription, then she made a judgment that Yunyao was a cultivator. However, even though they knew that Yunyao was indeed a cultivator, there was more about her that still remained unknown to them.

Gu Ning thought that Yunyao could be a member of a powerful family in the cultivation world, and she might have enemies.

If so, Leng Shaoting would be in danger if they continued to search for more information about Yunyao. Leng Shaoting was just a beginner, and was no match for a real senior cultivator.

When Gu Ning was reading Yunyao’s notebook, she suddenly snorted with laughter.

“What?” Leng Shaoting was confused.

“Well, you peed in bed when you were five, ha-ha, ha-ha.” Gu Ning laughed.

On one page, Yunyao recorded that Leng Shaoting peed in his bed when he was five years old, but he poured a glass of water onto his bed to disguise it. Yunyao clearly knew, but didn’t embarrass him and accepted his lie.

Leng Shaoting flushed and grabbed the notebook away from Gu Ning’s hands at once.

Although Gu Ning was curious to know more about Leng Shaoting’s childhood, she didn’t compete with Leng Shaoting since he felt embarrassed.

“Well, Shaoting, your mother left two good books about cultivation, I hope you can make full use of them,” Gu Ning said.

“I will.” Leng Shaoting put on a serious expression.

“Great, I’ll put them into my telepathic eye space and I’ll give them back to you later in case grandpa sees them,” Gu Ning said.

“Sure.” Leng Shaoting agreed.

When they were about to leave, Gu Ning suddenly thought of an important question. If Yunyao was a cultivator, she shouldn’t have died so easily!

“Shaoting, I just thought of something important. Since your mother was a cultivator, she shouldn’t have died so easily in the accident.”

Gu Ning turned to face Leng Shaoting and looked serious. “Cultivators die, but they don’t die easily. Can you tell me more details about your mother’s death? Did you see your parents’ bodies with your own eyes back then?”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting was surprised and remembered something abnormal.

“Well, I do realize there was something abnormal at the scene that year, because I only saw my father’s face and my mother’s face was broken after falling from the cliff because her face hit the ground,” Leng Shaoting said. He now doubted whether the dead woman was really her mother.

He only had the thought, but wasn’t sure whether it was true. Although cultivators wouldn’t easily die, they still died and nobody knew what exactly had happened back then. However, if the dead woman wasn’t his mother, who was she? Where did his mother go if she wasn’t there?

He refused to believe that his mother had abandoned his father in the accident, but he didn’t know what to believe now.

Gu Ning also had the same idea that the dead woman might not be Leng Shaoting’s mother, but like Leng Shaoting, it was only her doubt, because she had no evidence.

Like what Leng Shaoting just had in mind, cultivators wouldn’t easily die, but they could still die, especially in a terrible accident. Besides, Yunyao fell from a very high cliff. It wouldn’t kill her if she was a senior cultivator, but she could lose her life if her level was low.

Therefore, it was possible that Yunyao was really dead.

Gu Ning had no intention to make any unkind speculations about the death of Leng Shaoting’s parents.

“Where did your parents lose their lives,” Gu Ning asked. Since they had doubt now, they needed to know more about it.

“Kunlun Mountain. They were chasing an evil criminal, and the criminal must have been very strong so even my parents were no match for him,” Leng Shaoting said.

If the criminal was able to defeat a cultivator, either he was too strong or Yunyao must have been too weak.
