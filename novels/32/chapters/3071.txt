Chapter 3072 - 3072 We Only Need to Make Money

3072 We Only Need to Make Money

Because Leng Xiaoyao was extremely skilled, the three male teammates sided with her. One of them said, “Drizzle, we didn’t work together with Queen Xiaoyao just now. You can’t blame her for that.”

“Right, there is nothing wrong with her attitude. Why did you criticize her for no reason?” Another male teammate chimed in.

“You…” The female teammate was even angrier and even wanted to log out and leave them. She didn’t want to play with them any longer, but it would affect her level if she logged out all of a sudden, so she didn’t dare to do that.

In the end, she had to tolerate it and say nothing.

They followed Leng Xiaoyao and passed many levels. Watching Leng Xiaoyao getting to higher and higher levels, they admired Leng Xiaoyao more and more.

During the game, they ran into players who had teamed up with Leng Xiaoyao before. After seeing Leng Xiaoyao’s record, they were all surprised. Someone directly asked whether it was Leng Xiaoyao.

“Are you Queen Xiaoyao? Weren’t you terrible before? When did you become so excellent?”

“Yeah, it’s me.” Leng Xiaoyao answered.

“Did you hire a master to help you?”

“It’s just a game. I don’t think masters will have interest in it. It’s not difficult,” Leng Xiaoyao said disdainfully.

“What?” The player was struck dumb for a moment and didn’t know what to say. Although he agreed with Leng Xiaoyao, she had made a big change!

Leng Xiaoyao ignored them, then logged out after she was done and began to draw the characters in her game.

However, when the others heard Leng Xiaoyao’s reply, they complained and doubted whether she was really Queen Xiaoyao. Some people said she was arrogant and should get to a high level to prove her abilities.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t know what they talked about behind her back, but she knew they disliked her. Therefore, she wouldn’t care even if she heard their discussion.

As Leng Xiaoyao drew characters for her game, she paid attention to the stocks too. Given the situation, she should sell the stocks once the prices went up, so she had to keep an eye on them.

Without surprise, at 10 pm, the collapsing stocks started skyrocketing. Immediately, Leng Yecheng carried her laptop to see Leng Yecheng.

Because it wasn’t that late, Leng Yecheng was still reading files in his study.

At the same time, he also checked the stock market once in a while. Right after Leng Xiaoyao noticed that the stocks were rising, he noticed it too. He was about to call Leng Xiaoyao, but she called him from outside the door.

Afterwards, Leng Yecheng moved his wheelchair to open the door for Leng Xiaoyao. The next moment, he asked urgently, “The stocks are spiking! I wanted to call you, but you already came over.”

“It seems to be the right time. We can focus on them for a while, then sell them when I tell you,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Although many people sold the stocks after they collapsed, some still waited and observed the market. The stocks weren’t declining all the time. They sometimes rose, so many people decided to wait.

If all the individual investors sold their stocks, Leng Xiaoyao wouldn’t be able to buy all the stocks alone. In other words, even if she wanted to make money, she must do it according to her abilities. Besides, Leng Xiaoyao was still worried that the situation might be different.

Therefore, she should know where to stop.

“Sure.” Leng Yecheng answered. Although he was filled with excitement, he was also nervous. After all, accidents could happen before the end.

In addition, the stocks were rising at an unusual speed, so Leng Yecheng asked Leng Xiaoyao, “Yaoyao, is this being done by insiders?”

“I don’t know. Perhaps,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She wasn’t sure of it either. “It’s doesn’t matter. We only need to make money.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You’re right. We only want to make money.” Leng Yecheng agreed with Leng Xiaoyao, but he was afraid that they might not be able to make much money.

Watching the total number rapidly increasing and gradually succeeding his investment, Leng Yecheng was so nervous that his palm became wet.

A while later, he had more money than he had invested and he was finally relieved.

Even if he sold them right now, he wouldn’t lose.

However, the number was still rapidly increasing and Leng Yecheng got even more excited as time went by, because he was going to make a fortune like that!

One time, two times, three times…

There were thirty million yuan in his account, while he only had invested ten million yuan in the market! In an instant, Leng Yecheng turned to look at Leng Xiaoyao, feeling that this was a great moment to sell the stocks. If the prices went down later, he would suffer a great loss.

“Be patient.” Before Leng Yecheng said a word, Leng Xiaoyao understood what he wanted to say.

Because of the result, Leng Yecheng fully trusted Leng Xiaoyao. Since she said they needed to be patient, he would wait patiently till Leng Xiaoyao told him to sell.

When Leng Xiaoyao watched the stocks rising, she thought of Li Mochen. She wondered whether he noticed the big change.

Without delay, she took out her phone and called Li Mochen.

Before long, Li Mochen answered it. His voice wasn’t excited, but wasn’t cold either. “Anything up?”

“I just want to know whether you’re looking at the stock market. I’m afraid you might be too busy to check the market. It’ll be a shame if you miss the best time to sell, so I decided to give you a call. I hope I’m bothering you,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Hearing that, Li Mochen was struck dumb for a moment. He didn’t expect Leng Xiaoyao to care about him and felt warm.

“Yeah, I’m paying special attention to it. Thank you for your reminder,” Li Mochen said. He didn’t think her kind reminder was unnecessary just because he was already watching the stock market.

“My pleasure. Oh, don’t forget to eat together after you make money,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“I won’t,” Li Mochen replied.

“Great, see you then. It’s about time to sell,” Leng Xiaoyao said, then they hung up.

Leng Yecheng wasn’t curious and didn’t ask who Leng Xiaoyao was calling. He paid complete attention to the numbers on the screen of his computer.

Four times, five times, six times…

Leng Yecheng was too shocked to say a word. He was trembling in excitement and could barely believe his eyes.

In order to check whether it was a dream, Leng Yecheng secretly pinched his arm.

It hurt!

It wasn’t a dream, but he still felt it was too unbelievable to be true.

Seeing Leng Yecheng’s reaction, Leng Xiaoyao felt amused, but she could understand.
