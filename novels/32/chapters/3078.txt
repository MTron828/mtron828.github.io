3079 Where Is the Evidence?

Chu Jianan didn’t reply to Leng Yuqi after a long while. At the beginning, Leng Yuqi thought he might be busy. However, she couldn’t help thinking much about it after a long time had passed. It was Saturday today, so Chu Jianan shouldn’t be so busy!

Chu Jianan didn’t reply to her, so she felt too embarrassed to send him another message.

…

At the same time, Leng Xiaoyao got out of her car nearby An Chenmeng’s home. She went closer till she was outside the house.

From outside, she sensed a slight evil power from the An family’s house. There was no more evil power, so it must be from An Chenmeng’s jade pendant.

When Leng Xiaoyao came here, she found out that An Chenmeng and her parents were all home and An Chenjun was on a date with Shen Xiyin.

Leng Xiaoyao could directly remove the evil power from An Chenmeng’s jade pendant today, but she didn’t, because it wasn’t the right time yet.

She hadn’t gotten any evidence, so it would easily alert the mastermind if she helped An Chenmeng get rid of the evil power now.

Now she was sure that only An Chenmeng had a jade pendant with evil power, so she was really relieved. Now she just needed to meet Shen Xiyin.

The evil jade pendant would affect An Chenmeng’s health, but she should be fine after a short time. Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao would deal with it after figuring out whether Shen Xiyin was aware of the evil power.

She needed evidence to prove that An Chenmeng was guilty. If she removed the evil power from An Chenmeng’s jade pendant right now, nobody would believe it if she said that Shen Xiyin was guilty. At that time, people might even think that she misunderstood Shen Xiyin.

Coincidentally, when Leng Xiaoyao found An Chenjun and Shen Xiyin, she saw that Ling Tianqi and Feng Rui were with them. Pei Heran was absent.

Because they were all members of high society, it wasn’t strange that Ling Tianqi knew An Chenjun.

Therefore, Leng Xiaoyao could get in touch with Shen Xiyin by joining Ling Tianqi.

Since she needed Ling Tianqi’s help, she had to be honest with him.

When Leng Xiaoyao walked out, she called Ling Tianqi. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

At that time, Ling Tianqi was still dining. Because there were many people, they didn’t finish the meal quickly, but chatted leisurely.

Once Ling Tianqi saw Leng Xiaoyao’s call, he stood up and went outside. He was afraid that it might be an emergency. After all, they weren’t so close that they would call each other for a casual chat.

Ling Tianqi picked up the call right after walking out of the private room, and asked, “Hi, Xiaoyao, anything up?”

“Brother Tianqi, I need to speak to you about something. Is there anyone else with you?” Leng Xiaoyao asked, even though she had used her magical senses to check whether he was alone when he answered her call.

“Not at all!” Ling Tianqi said.

“The thing is that I know you’re with An Chenjun right now. After witnessing something, I’m suspicious of his girlfriend, Shen Xiyin, for having bad intentions. I need to find out more about her by being in contact with her. Is it convenient for you to let me join you? I’m sorry I can’t tell you any details, but don’t worry, I won’t cause you any trouble,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Although she hoped that Ling Tianqi would help her, she wouldn’t force him to if it was inconvenient. After all, she didn’t want to make it difficult for him.

“No problem. We’re in Jinhe Restaurant right now. If you can come here within half an hour, you can come to join us. In order to make it look natural, we can pretend that we ran into each other by chance outside the restaurant. I’ll invite you to join us and I’ll say that I need to talk to you about something. You can send me a message after you arrive, so that I’ll know you’re here. If you need more time, I can go to pick you up after we separate,” Ling Tianqi said. He was more than happy to do Leng Xiaoyao a favor. He didn’t think Leng Xiaoyao would cause him any trouble. Instead, he felt honored that she turned to him for help.

However, it wasn’t appropriate to let Leng Xiaoyao go to the private room where they were dining right now. After all, it was extremely disrespectful to only ask Leng Xiaoyao over after they finished the meal.

“I can arrive in half an hour, but I put on some make-up today and covered my freckles. I’m afraid you might not be able to recognize me. So I’ll tell you what I’m wearing today. I’m wearing a creamy, white dress with a bun and a pair of white shoes. I have a black laptop bag in my hand,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Great.” Ling Tianqi answered. He suddenly looked forward to seeing Leng Xiaoyao. He wondered how she looked after putting on make-up and a dress. It must be gorgeous!

After that, Leng Xiaoyao took a taxi to Jinhe Restaurant, only taking twenty minutes on the road.

After she arrived, she sent Ling Tianqi a message.

Once Leng Xiaoyao sent the message, Ling Tianqi saw it. He replied to Leng Xiaoyao and said that he would go down right away.

Actually, they were about to separate before Leng Xiaoyao sent the message, but Ling Tianqi deliberately wasted more time by going to the washroom.

About three minutes later, he read Leng Xiaoyao’s message.

After that, Ling Tianqi didn’t waste any more time. He immediately walked out of the washroom and told his friends they could go.

Ling Tianqi didn’t tell Feng Rui what Leng Xiaoyao wanted to do. He thought it was better if fewer people knew.

After they walked out, Ling Tianqi focused on the outside. Then he saw Leng Xiaoyao in a white dress with a bun, a pair of white shoes and a laptop bag.

However, her face was so stunning that he barely had the courage to call her name.

The freckles on Leng Xiaoyao’s face were covered, but they could still faintly be seen, otherwise he wouldn’t be able to recognize her.

“X-Xiaoyao?” Ling Tianqi called Leng Xiaoyao, but there wasn’t much confidence in his voice. He was still afraid that he might be wrong.

Hearing Ling Tianqi’s words, Feng Rui turned to look around, but failed to see Leng Xiaoyao. While he was confused, he heard a familiar voice, “Hi, Brother Tianqi, Brother Rui.”

Saying that, Leng Xiaoyao walked towards them. “What a coincidence! I didn’t expect to see you here.”

Seeing the beautiful woman walking towards them, Feng Rui was shocked. S-She was Leng Xiaoyao?

Ling Tianqi was also amazed, but he was mentally prepared, so he was much less surprised. “Hi, Xiaoyao, what a coincidence! I was about to go see you. Since we met, why don’t you join us? I need to talk to you about something.”
