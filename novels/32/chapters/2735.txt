Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“It’s fine. I’ve seen countless dramatic people before. Don’t worry, I can make sure that you’ll be able to walk again within five days. And you’ll receive compensation according to the rules. After you have made a full recovery, you can get back to your work at the construction site if you’re willing to,” said Gu Ning. Then she gave a glance at people in the ward. “I must be honest with you all. It was indeed a scheme this time. The criminals have already been arrested. We have evidence and it’ll be released within two days. However, if you’re not willing to go back and work for me, I won’t force you to stay.”

Hearing Gu Ning’s words, most of the people were convinced, but some still held doubts. They thought that Gu Ning might have made someone a scapegoat to save Shenghua Real Estate’s reputation.

Another group of troublesome family members exchanged glances with each other when they heard that Gu Ning could help Zhang Peng walk again within five days. It wasn’t good news for them.

If Gu Ning could cure them, their injured family members would be able to work again within five days like Zhang Peng.

In that case, they couldn’t receive a large amount of money either.

That wasn’t what they wanted. Even the injured man didn’t want that result.

He would rather stay in the hospital for a few more months to get more compensation. Anyway, Shenghua Real Estate would pay the fee, so they didn’t need to pay the bill.

Some of the other people doubted Gu Ning’s words as well, but they also wanted to get better as soon as possible. Anyway, they remained silent for the time being to see how Gu Ning would cure Zhang Peng.

“So, are you willing to accept my treatment?” Gu Ning asked Zhang Peng.

“Of course,” said Zhang Peng without hesitation.

After that, Gu Ning took out a power crystal and gave it to Zhang Peng. “Since you trust me, take this. There are so many people watching so don’t be afraid that it might be harmful.”

“Sure.” Zhang Peng was willing to trust Gu Ning, so he wasn’t afraid. He took the pill and directly swallowed it.

Within moments, Zhang Peng felt a flow of coolness running through his body. It was quite comfortable as it filled his body with energy.

A while later, the flow reached his wound, and he immediately felt the pain ease. He widened his eyes in surprise.

Everyone was focusing on Zhang Peng as they didn’t want to miss any of his reactions. When they saw the surprise on his face, they were curious about his feelings.

“Zhang Peng, how do you feel now?” asked another injured worker quickly.

“Well, after taking Chairman Gu’s pill, I’m full of energy again. The wound isn’t so painful either,” said Zhang Peng.

Hearing that, everyone was surprised but they still couldn’t believe it, even though Zhang Peng said it aloud. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Was this medicine really so effective?

Gu Ning didn’t just give Zhang Peng a single power crystal. She took another bottle of magical power liquid and gave it to him. “This is the medicine liquid. Apply it to the wound once a day for three times. Remove the leg support before doing that. Only your leg has been injured and your hand is fine, so you can do that on your own.”

“Great.” Zhang Peng replied. He felt the immediate reaction after he took a pill, so he was full of excitement and anticipation now.

“The doctor will criticize you if you remove the support by yourself,” said a family member of the other injured worker in an unkind tone.

Zhang Peng looked at Gu Ning worriedly and Gu Ning said, “Don’t worry, I’ll speak to the hospital director about it.”

Hearing that, Zhang Peng was relieved because he trusted Gu Ning.

“Oh, do you think you own this hospital? Why should the hospital director listen to you?” The unkind family member added.

Gu Ning said nothing. She had confidence and didn’t want to argue with the unkind family member any longer.

At this moment, Leng Shaoting walked out. Seeing that, Gu Ning understood what he was going to do and she didn’t stop him.

Then she turned to other injured workers and asked, “How about you? Will you believe me and leave the hospital within five days, or will you stay here for months of treatment?”

They and their family members didn’t cause any trouble.

When they heard Gu Ning’s question, they didn’t answer right away, but discussed with their family members.

“I don’t think Chairman Gu will fool us, and Zhang Peng has tried it. He said he’s much better now. Why don’t we give it a try too?” said the injured worker on the second patient bed.

“Sure!” Since he agreed to do it, his family members supported him.

The second injured worker was hurt in the arm and there were other serious injuries around his body too.

When he agreed, Gu Ning took out a power crystal and told him to take it. He didn’t hesitate and took it at once. Right afterwards, he felt the same reaction and was also surprised.

Watching that, the third injured worker and his family members believed that the medicine was really effective, so they were willing to try it.

“Chairman Gu, let me try it,” said the third injured worker. He had basically the same injuries as Zhang Peng. He had a thigh fracture and some abrasions.

Once he said that, Gu Ning gave him a power crystal and a bottle of magical power liquid too.

On the fourth bed, was the injured worker whose family members made trouble, he suffered a broken arm and a slight concussion.

“And you?” Gu Ning asked.

Before the injured worker said anything, his mother opened her mouth. “We don’t believe it! Don’t try to avoid the compensation.”

Given the situation, it was a lie that they didn’t believe Gu Ning, because the other three injured workers said that they all felt better after taking the pill. They simply wanted money.

“I never had the idea to avoid the compensation, but I’ll only pay you the money according to the rules. It’s impossible for you to receive more than that. If you don’t accept it you’ll bear the result on your own. I won’t treat you again after I walk out of this ward,” said Gu Ning. If they didn’t want her treatment, she wouldn’t bother to pay more attention to them.

Hearing that, the fourth injured worker and his family members hesitated, because they were unwilling to lose the chance at treatment. In fact, they couldn’t get as much money as they wanted. However, they were reluctant to give in.

Before long, Leng Shaoting was back.

A few minutes later, the hospital director ran inside excitedly.

The moment he saw Gu Ning, he greeted her with a big smile. “Miss Gu, it’s so nice to see you! I’m the director of this hospital, Zhou Kequan. I’ve heard a lot about you from Governor Xiao.”
