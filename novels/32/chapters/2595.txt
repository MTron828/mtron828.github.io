Chapter 2596: Totally Convinced

Whether it could cure his disease or not, as long as it wasn’t harmful, he would give it a try.

“Sure.” Kang Shaojie nodded, then took out his phone to search for the official website of Colaine.

There was basic information about the owner and senior management of the company on its official website.

Kang Shaojie read the page of senior management and saw Gu Ning’s name along with other information about her on it.

When he read the information about Gu Ning, he was stunned and didn’t know what to say all of a sudden.

“What’s wrong?” Seeing that, Master Kang asked anxiously. At the same time, he wondered whether Gu Ning wasn’t the owner of Colaine after all.

Master Kang wasn’t doubting Gu Ning. After all, she just helped Kang Shaojie defeat Kang Yuannan, so she shouldn’t be hostile to the Kang family, but if Gu Ning was really the owner of Colaine, Kang Shaojie shouldn’t be stunned! Gu Ning just told him she was the owner of Colaine, right?

Hearing Master Kang’s words, Kang Shaojie came back to his senses, but he still looked shocked. “Gu Ning is the owner of Colaine, but she’s also the chairman of the Shengning Organization…”

“What?” Master Kang was amazed too. He didn’t expect Gu Ning to be the chairman of the Shengning Organization as well.

Although they didn’t know much about the Shengning Organization, they had heard of it.

Within slightly more than a year, the Shengning Organization had become a major business group in many industries. It was a miracle.

However, because it was an enterprise in the capital and they were far away, they didn’t know much about it. They had no idea who founded the Shengning Organization.

To their surprise, the builder of the Shengning Organization was a girl who was only about nineteen years old. In other words, Gu Ning started it up when she was only eighteen.

“D-Did you read it correctly?” Master Kang’s voice was trembling in shock. He asked not because he thought Kang Shaojie was lying to him, but because it was too shocking.

“Yes, I did. Her name is on the website. There is also her photo. It can’t be wrong.” Kang Shaojie couldn’t digest the news right now, but he wouldn’t doubt it because he had met Gu Ning.

“Get more information about her on the Internet,” said Master Kang.

“Of course,” said Kang Shaojie, then he searched for more information about Gu Ning.

Gu Ning, as it was shown on the website, was the founder of the Shengning Organization and its subsidiaries.

Below were her other achievements. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After reading the list of her achievements, Kang Shaojie took a deep breath in shock. Gu Ning was much more outstanding than he thought. Given her background, it was impossible for her to want to harm his family.

“What does it say?” Master Kang asked in a hurry.

Kang Shaojie opened his mouth, but didn’t know what to say, so he directly gave his phone to Master Kang. “There are too many of her achievements. I can’t explain all of them to you. Read it by yourself.”

Master Kang then read it for himself, and was astonished after reading Gu Ning’s achievements.

After a long while, Master Kang finally digested the information about Gu Ning. “Wow, she’s such a talent! I’ve never seen someone like this before!”

“Right!” Kang Shaojie agreed.

“Maintain your relationship with Gu Ning. It’ll only do us good,” said Master Kang. He didn’t intend to get anything from Gu Ning, but as a businessman, it was necessary for him to build his connections.

“I know,” said Kang Shaojie. Even if Gu Ning wasn’t the founder of the Shengning Organization, he had already decided to keep their friendship after Gu Ning helped him.

Yes, he saw Gu Ning as his friend, not just for benefits.

“Give me the medicine right now! After reading the information about her, I’m convinced,” said Master Kang. Although he didn’t fully believe that this medicine could cure his illness, he believed it wouldn’t be harmful.

Hearing that, Kang Shaojie immediately took out the medicine and helped Master Kang take a pill. After that, he put the two other pills into the drawer of the bedside table. He reminded Master Kang to take a pill every three days.

Because Kang Shaojie was going to be busy these next few days, he might not have time to watch Master Kang take the medicine, so he could only remind his father beforehand.

The moment Master Kang took a power crystal, he felt the change of his body. Although it wasn’t immediate, Master Kang still felt the change.

“It’s indeed amazing! I just took it and yet I can already feel that my body is changing. I think I’m feeling more energetic again,” said Master Kang in amazement.

Even though Kang Shaojie already told him how effective this medicine was, he could only feel it after experiencing it himself.

Kang Shaojie was happy for his father. “That’s wonderful. Let’s see its effect after a few days.”

“If it’s so effective, can you buy more from Gu Ning? Your mother hasn’t been feeling well these days either,” said Master Kang.

“I’ll need to ask, but this medicine is very rare, so I might not be able to get many,” said Kang Shaojie.

“I understand. Buy as many as you can. Don’t make things difficult for her,” said Master Kang. Actually, given Gu Ning’s background, he didn’t dare to cause her trouble. However, everyone wanted to be healthy, so they would buy the medicine as long as Gu Ning was willing to sell it to them.

“Of course,” said Kang Shaojie. He knew what he should do.

After that, Kang Shaojie left his father and went back to his study. Sitting in front of the desk, he was still digesting what he learned about Gu Ning today.

He now admired Gu Ning more than ever.

However, although he learned about her background, he didn’t contact her right away.

As for the medicine, he could only give Gu Ning a call later to invite her out for a meal. He would ask to buy the medicine during the meal.

…

Two and a half hours after Gu Ning called Zheng Peng, Zheng Peng, along with a team of seven people, arrived at the appointed hotel to meet Gu Ning.
