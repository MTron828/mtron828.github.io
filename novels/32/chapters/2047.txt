Chapter 2048: Aren’t You Ashamed?

“Come on, it can’t be her family’s car. There aren’t so many rich kids,” said Girl B with jealousy.

“Even if there aren’t many rich kids, how do you know she isn’t one of them?” said Girl C. She thought it was very evil to bad-mouth other people without knowing the truth.

“Do you know she’s one of those rich kids?” Girl A argued.

“I don’t. Since you don’t know it either, stop attacking the girl. Rumors can kill. It’s very unkind to bad-mouth other people behind their back,” said Girl C.

“Luo Yinyin, you don’t even know her, why are you defending her?” said Girl A. She was mad at Girl C and criticized her.

“Yang Ziyi, I just want to remind you not to bad-mouth other people without knowing the truth. It’s very evil. It’s not good for you either. If you can’t understand that, I’m leaving,” said Luo Yinyin in annoyance, then left right away.

She didn’t know that Yang Ziyi was such an unkind girl till now. She thought that she better keep a distance away from her, or she would be attacked one day as well.

“You…” Yang Ziyi was mad, but didn’t dare to argue with Luo Yinyin any longer because Luo Yinyin’s family was richer than hers. However, she didn’t understand why Luo Yinyin chose to stand with a strange girl.

Yang Ziyi still didn’t think she was wrong, but the other girls agreed with Luo Yinyin.

Chu Peihan already heard their discussion. If they talked about something else, she wouldn’t mind it, but she must do something because they defamed her. Therefore, Chu Peihan walked straight to Yang Ziyi and the other girls.

Seeing Chu Peihan walking to them in annoyance, Yang Ziyi and the other girls realized that Chu Peihan must have heard their discussion. Yang Ziyi panicked a little, but didn’t think it was a big deal. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She didn’t think that Chu Peihan would dare to hurt her just because she said something bad about her, so Yang Ziyi glared at Chu Peihan.

Nevertheless, Yang Ziyi and the other girls were filled with jealousy once they saw Chu Peihan clearly because Chu Peihan was prettier than them. Even if Chu Peihan wasn’t the most beautiful girl in their school, she was already very outstanding.

Seeing Yang Ziyi glaring at her, Chu Peihan smiled mockingly. They were bad-mouthing her just now, but why were they mad at her now?

“I heard your discussion. What? Can’t other girls sit in luxurious cars? Can’t other girls have luxurious cars? Does a girl have to have a sugar-daddy in order to sit in a luxurious car? Why do you hate rich people so much? Why wouldn’t you stop attacking me? You can’t defame me just because you’re jealous of me.” Chu Peihan didn’t show much anger on her face. She simply mocked them.

Chu Peihan said they were jealous of her not because she was narcissistic, but because the jealousy in their eyes was too obvious to be ignored. Besides, they got jealous of her right after defaming her.

“Ridiculous! No one is jealous of you. Why should we be jealous of you? You’re shameless. Stop flattering yourself.” Yang Ziyi argued in anger and humiliation. She denied it, but the jealousy in her eyes was indeed too obvious to be hidden.

“Right, we don’t hate rich people either. There are a lot of girls who ache to get famous by finding themselves a sugar-daddy in our school. You might be one of them!” Girl A chimed in. Although she realized it was unkind after hearing Luo Yinyin’s words, jealousy got the better of her when she faced Chu Peihan now.

“Since you know nothing about me, how dare you defame me? Don’t you know it can seriously damage a girl’s reputation? It’s fine if you’re talking about the truth, but what if it isn’t? You’re deliberately making rumors and causing me trouble,” said Chu Peihan. She wasn’t mad, but squinted coldly.

Looking at Chu Peihan being like that, Yang Ziyi and the other girls felt guilty in an instant.

“Tell us, is the car your family’s?” Yang Ziyi had no sense to face reality. Since Chu Peihan came to argue with them, it proved she didn’t have a sugar-daddy, but Yang Ziyi wouldn’t give up asking about that.

Yang Ziyi believed that Chu Peihan must have a sugar-daddy, but didn’t dare to admit it for the sake of her reputation.

“Does it have to be my family’s car or a sugar-daddy’s? Can’t it be owned by my relative or friend? Don’t you have rich relatives or friends? Are your relatives and friends all poor?” Chu Peihan didn’t say that the car was her family’s because it wasn’t.

Anyway, Chu Peihan kept on arguing against Yang Ziyi and the other girls. It was true that they all had rich relatives and friends. When Yang Ziyi went to enroll, she had also borrowed a good car from her relative.

The car didn’t cost as much as a million yuan, but it at least cost about seven hundred thousand yuan.

However, they still refused to give in, so Yang Ziyi said, “Who knows whether you’re telling the truth!”

“No matter what, it’s none of your business! Face your fault and stop annoying me. I have a quick temper and I can ruin you if you won’t stop.” Chu Peihan coldly threatened them, which scared Yang Ziyi and the other girls. They were mad at being threatened, but didn’t dare to resist.

“Hey, what’s happening here? What are you arguing about?”

Right at this moment, a cheerful male voice sounded and they turned to look at him at once.

The next second, the girls became shy.

“Oh, hi, Senior Han!” Yang Ziyi and the other girls greeted him in a very gentle tone. They didn’t seem mean at all now!

Chu Peihan, however, rolled her eyes at the young man. She was reluctant to see him.

The young man was exactly Han Chenglin.

Han Chenglin didn’t reply to Yang Ziyi and the other girls, nor did he pay any attention to them. Instead, he stared at Chu Peihan and gloated over her embarrassment. “Hey, don’t you have a car yourself? Why do you need your friend to send you back every time? Don’t you feel embarrassed? Students in our school are very complicated. Be careful not to be misunderstood, or the loss will outweigh the gain.”

Han Chenglin was defending Chu Peihan by saying it was her friend who sent her back, not a sugar-daddy. Moreover, Chu Peihan had her own car and she wasn’t poor at all. She didn’t need a sugar-daddy.

He also believed that it was just Chu Peihan’s friend instead of a sugar-daddy.
