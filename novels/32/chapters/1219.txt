Chapter 1221 Who Do You Think You Are?

They had bungee jumped before, and it wasn’t uncommon that bungee jumpers would be pushed down although it was indeed a bit much.The girl who came here with Zhao Fulin put on a satisfied smile. She didn’t care about Gu Ning’s reaction now.

Gu Ning focused on Zhao Fulin once she got into the elevator, and Zhao Fulin stopped screaming halfway, which wasn’t strange, because many people wouldn’t scream too. However, Zhao Fulin was different. She was in shock now.

A person might die within 2 to 15 minutes after going into shock, and Gu Ning could only hope that Zhao Fulin would survive.

Within a minute, Gu Ning reached the first floor. She dashed outside without hesitation. Because she ran too fast, she surprised everyone in the hall.

“Jesus, she runs so fast!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“I can’t believe my eyes.”

“...”

Gu Ning went to the riverside under the bungee jumping platform as fast as she could, but she could only wait there for Zhao Fulin.

After bungee jumping, the bungee jumper would be brought back to the shore by a boat.

The moment Gu Ning reached the shore, Zhao Fulin finished the jump and she saw Zhao Fulin being moved onto the boat.

At the same time, she also noticed a good-looking young man in his early twenties, he was looking at Zhao Fulin with obvious disdain.

Gu Ning immediately remembered what the two girls had talked about at the launching pad, and she realized that this young man must be Jiang Ze. Besides, Zhao Fulin came here to bungee jump because of him.

Although Gu Ning didn’t know why they agreed to do this together, she knew that this young man wasn’t a good man.

Gu Ning had sympathy for Zhao Fulin and was mad at this young man.

Right at this time, An Ran and Zhu Yuanzhen ran over and asked, “Miss Gu, what’s wrong?”

“I need to deal with something,” Gu Ning said and didn’t explain further.

In the boat, a staff member saw that Zhao Fulin was unconscious, but he didn’t think it was a big deal, because it had happened before.

However, when he found that her limbs were cold and her face turned pale as her temperature went down, he realized something must be wrong.

Another staff member took out a blood pressure measuring instrument at once.

After measuring her blood pressure, he found that Zhao Fulin’s blood pressure was going down all the time, which was a bad sign. “No, this girl is dying!” Both of the two staff members panicked.

The girl who stood on the launching pad paid complete attention to Zhao Fulin the entire time. When she saw Zhao Fulin was unconscious, she was satisfied.

Cao Wenxin and Gao Chengyun had seen this scene before, so they didn’t think it was very serious.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya, however, knew that it couldn’t be simple since Gu Ning ran to Zhao Fulin in a hurry.

Once the boat was back to the shore, a staff member carried Zhao Fulin on his back and he planned to send her to the hospital, but Gu Ning stopped him.

“Move!” The staff member was mad when Gu Ning stood in his way.

Jiang Ze stood still even though Zhao Fulin passed out right in front of him.

“Put her down. I can save her,” Gu Ning said with confidence.

Nevertheless, the staff member wouldn’t believe her.

“Can you? Do you know what has happened to her? She’s in a state of shock now,” the staff member said.

He knew that Gu Ning wanted to help, so he remained kind.

There were many people around them, and they were all scared, including Jiang Ze. Zhao Fulin could lose her life being in a state of shock!

“Send her to the hospital now!” Jiang Ze said at once. He was unwilling to take responsibility for this terrible accident, because it was he who brought Zhao Fulin here.

Actually, he only wanted to make fun of Zhao Fulin, and he didn’t want her to lose her life.

“Give her to me and I can save her life,” Gu Ning said in a serious tone.

“Who do you think you are?” Jiang Ze criticized Gu Ning. Gu Ning was merely a young girl in his eyes, and he didn’t believe her.

Gu Ning had no time to waste. Since the staff member was unwilling to give Zhao Fulin to her, she had to grab Zhao Fulin away.

“You...” The staff member was angry, but he was no match for Gu Ning, and Gu Ning directly put a power crystal into Zhao Fulin’s mouth and made her swallow it.

At the same time, she secretly put her magical power into Zhao Fulin’s body to protect Zhao Fulin’s organs.

Cao Wenxin and the others couldn’t see Gu Ning now, so they didn’t know what Gu Ning was doing.

After Gu Ning made Zhao Fulin swallow the pill, Jiang Ze ran forward.

“What did you make her swallow?” Jiang Ze shouted.
