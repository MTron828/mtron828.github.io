Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

They trusted Gu Ning very much, so no one refused to take her power crystal. After taking it, they thanked Gu Ning.

Before long, they felt the effect and were surprised, but they didn’t ask about it. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Ningning, should we go to help Shaoting?” asked Xu Jinchen. Although he knew Leng Shaoting was very strong, he was still a bit worried. After all, they had nothing to deal with now.

“Don’t worry, he can handle it. If I don’t stay here and take care of you, he won’t be able to focus on fighting against the monster,” said Gu Ning. She wanted to help Leng Shaoting, but he had told her to stay there. She could only listen to him to set his mind at ease.

In that case, Xu Jinchen said nothing further. He was also afraid that something else might go wrong if Gu Ning left. They had been through a lot today!

They could accept it because they had killed monsters and ghosts several times with Leng Shaoting. They were already used to it, but some soldiers who encountered it for the first time were extremely frightened.

They were men and soldiers, but they would still be frightened. After all, it was totally beyond their imagination. They couldn’t believe it really existed.

Therefore, Gu Ning needed to remind them not to spread the news in case it caused unnecessary trouble.

At the same time, Leng Shaoting chased Xiao Nanchen to the woods and targeted the monster in his body.

However, the monster was strong, so it wasn’t injured by Leng Shaoting so quickly. The fight continued for a long while even though the monster was at a disadvantage. The monster wasn’t comparable to Leng Shaoting, otherwise it wouldn’t have run away the moment it saw him.

Due to the gap between their abilities, the monster had to run away.

In fact, the monster was really surprised to see a cultivator at such a high level.

After Leng Shaoting controlled the monster, the monster couldn’t fight back at all, but it threatened. “If you dare to attack me any longer, I’ll destroy myself and this body!”

Hearing that, Leng Shaoting had to be gentle, but he didn’t stop attacking the monster. It was impossible for him to let it get away. “What are you? Why did you possess his body?” he asked coldly.

Because the monster hid inside Xiao Nanchen’s body, Leng Shaoting didn’t know what it was.

“I have no intention of becoming your enemy. I just need to live in a mortal’s body,” said the monster.

“So? You broke the rule when you possess a mortal’s body,” said Leng Shaoting.

“I don’t care about the sh*t rules. I need you, those so-called good people, to stay away from me. We can live our life well. Anyway, I already possessed his body. If you separate us violently, he won’t live long,” said the monster.

“Really? Let’s see!” said Leng Shaoting in a cold voice and became violent. He summoned strong magical energy and hit Xiao Nanchen heavily. He was determined to beat the monster out of Xiao Nanchen’s body.

Because the monster was completely controlled by Leng Shaoting, it could barely fight back and was easily hit by him.

The monster was knocked out of Xiao Nanchen’s body and Leng Shaoting saw that it was a black wolf.

It turned out to be a monster wolf.

The monster wolf wasn’t badly injured in the fight against Leng Shaoting. It only lost a lot of strength.

If Leng Shaoting injured it seriously, Xiao Nanchen would be injured too, so Leng Shaoting had no intention of hurting it. He only made it consume a lot of its strength till it left Xiao Nanchen’s body.

However, the monster wolf was greatly weakened after being knocked out of Xiao Nanchen’s body.

“You…” It thought Leng Shaoting would be gentle for Xiao Nanchen’s sake, but unexpectedly Leng Shaoting didn’t hesitate to beat it out of Xiao Nanchen’s body.

Once the monster wolf left Xiao Nanchen’s body, Xiao Nanchen sank down to the ground. He could hardly breathe and his life was in a lot of danger.

Leng Shaoting swiftly went to his side and helped him take a power crystal to make sure that he would survive. After they went back later, Gu Ning would put magical power into his body.

The monster wolf tried to seize this chance and run away, but Leng Shaoting stopped it.

“What do you want? You already beat me out of his body.” The monster wolf angrily questioned.

“Do you think it’s enough? I did force you out of my friend’s body, but if I hadn’t done that, you would continue to possess his body. If I had been a little late, he could have lost his life. You’ve done a terrible thing. Although you didn’t succeed, you still need to take responsibility. What if you succeeded? Why should innocent people suffer?” said Leng Shaoting.

“You…” Hearing that, the monster wolf didn’t know what to say. It knew arguing was useless, so it could only fight back, but it was not comparable to Leng Shaoting so he easily beat it.

“Tell me, why did you possess his body?” asked Leng Shaoting. He didn’t think it was a scheme, but it was necessary to interrogate it.

“Because he has the date of birth and horoscope I need, otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to enter his body,” said the monster wolf.

It was true that it wasn’t easy for monsters to possess a mortal’s body. They needed the right date of birth and horoscope.

“Why did you have to possess him?” asked Leng Shaoting.

“Because I want to see the mortal world. I can’t do anything with my own body,” said the monster wolf. When it said that, it showed great interest and anticipation for the mortal world.

“Are you sure you have not been ordered to cause trouble?” asked Leng Shaoting. It wasn’t likely for it to be a scheme, but he should be careful.

Hearing that, the monster wolf was struck dumb for a second, then mocked. “No mortal can order me to do anything!”

The monster wolf looked sincere. Leng Shaoting was mostly convinced by it, but he wasn’t sure it was the truth.

“Are you sure?” asked Leng Shaoting.

“What? Do you think someone has ordered me to do that? Don’t think lightly of me. I don’t listen to mortals,” said the monster wolf mockingly.

In that case, Leng Shaoting stopped asking more questions and directly killed it.
