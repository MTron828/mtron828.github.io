3085 Go to the Antique Street

“What? Grandpa has a gift. Can’t I get one too?” At this time, Leng Yecheng walked out with his crutches and spoke with slight envy.

“Of course you can have a gift too. I would never forget you, uncle,” Leng Xiaoyao said with a smile.

“Great!” Leng Yecheng didn’t hesitate to accept it, because he knew that Leng Xiaoyao didn’t lack money. It wasn’t a big deal if she bought a gift for him.

“Don’t be shameless! You should send Yaoyao a gift. How could you ask her for a gift instead? Don’t you know that you’re older than her?” Leng Changyuan couldn’t stand it and criticized Leng Yecheng.

!!

“I don’t want an expensive gift. I simply want Yaoyao to care about me too. And I’ve given her a lot of gifts before. Can’t I receive a gift from Yaoyao?” Leng Yecheng felt aggrieved.

Leng Changyuan was struck dumb.

“Alright, alright, I’m not wealthy. I won’t buy too expensive gifts for you. I just want you to know that I care about you.” Leng Xiaoyao interrupted them at once. She didn’t want them to argue.

Obviously, she said that to Leng Changyuan in order not to worry him. She wouldn’t buy expensive stuff.

After having breakfast, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t rush to go out. Instead, she went back to her room for a while and continued to spy on Shen Xiyin as she worked on the game.

It wasn’t difficult for Leng Xiaoyao to do two things at the same time.

At 8:30 am, An Chenjun left, but Shen Xiyin stayed. At 9:30 am, Shen Xiyin left too and drove to the antique street.

The antique street…

An idea dawned on Leng Xiaoyao. She could go to the antique street and buy some beautiful objects for Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng!

Although Leng Changyuan and Leng Yecheng weren’t antique lovers, nobody would dislike valuable antiques.

Although she didn’t have the same abilities as Gu Ning, she could still feel the magical power from afar.

Gu Ning was her mother, so she couldn’t be bad at it. Ever since she was little, she had learned a lot from Gu Ning. In fact, she mastered skills as well as Gu Ning did. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The only things she didn’t have were Gu Ning’s Jade Eyes and magical power.

Anyway, Leng Xiaoyao made the decision, then carried her laptop and left.

She put on light make-up today.

At this time, Leng Yuqi was already up and was sunbathing in the yard.

Therefore, she saw Leng Xiaoyao walking out of the house.

Because of what had happened yesterday, Leng Yuqi didn’t sleep well last night and looked haggard.

Chu Jianan still didn’t reply to her, but she felt better after a night. However, she got anxious again when she saw Leng Xiaoyao. What was Leng Xiaoyao going to do with make-up on?

She couldn’t stop Leng Xiaoyao from leaving, but she was afraid that Leng Xiaoyao was going to go see Chu Jianan.

As a result, she walked up to Leng Xiaoyao at once and asked, “Where are you going?”

“None of your business.” Leng Xiaoyao said unhappily.

“Are you going to see Jianan?” Leng Yuqi asked.

“Leng Yuqi, I told you clearly yesterday. You cherish Chu Jianan, but I disdain him. I feel disgusted to even glance at him. So, don’t connect me with him again. It’s humiliating to me and I’ll pay you back,” Leng Xiaoyao warned coldly.

Even though she intended to use her beauty to make Chu Jianan regret what he did when she met him, she honestly had no interest in him right now.

“You…” Leng Yuqi couldn’t think reasonably at that moment. She couldn’t be sure whether Leng Xiaoyao really meant that. Even if Leng Xiaoyao meant that, what would Chu Jianan do?

She had no idea what Chu Jianan was thinking right now because he didn’t reply to her messages and refused to answer her calls.

Leng Xiaoyao ignored Leng Yuqi afterwards, and directly left and Leng Yuqi didn’t dare to stop her again.

Because Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want the Leng family to know where she was going, she didn’t take her family’s car, and instead took a taxi.

On her way, Leng Xiaoyao continued to spy on Shen Xiyin.

After Shen Xiyin arrived at the antique street, she didn’t go to see those antiques, but went to a large raw jade material store.

Leng Xiaoyao was aware that Shen Xiyin’s family was involved in the raw jade material industry, so she wasn’t surprised.

…

When Leng Xiaoyao arrived, Leng Yuqi finally received Chu Jianan’s call. She was too excited to be mad at him and answered his call without delay.

“Jianan, what are you doing now? I sent you messages, but you didn’t reply. I called you, but you refused to answer my calls,” Leng Yuqi said, sounding as if she was about to cry.

“I was drunk last night, and didn’t wake up till now, so I didn’t hear my phone ringing,” Chu Jianan said.

Chu Jianan was indeed drunk yesterday, but he wasn’t so drunk that he couldn’t use his phone. He simply didn’t want to talk to Leng Yuqi.

He ignored Leng Yuqi for a while because of Leng Xiaoyao, but had no intention of ending their relationship, so he decided to explain it to her after calming down.

“Oh, how do you feel now?” Leng Yuqi asked with concern. She didn’t doubt his explanation. After all, his explanation made her feel better.

However, upon thinking that Chu Jianan couldn’t take his eyes off Leng Xiaoyao when they met yesterday, she was still mad.

“I still have a bit of a headache,” Chu Jianan said.

“Drink some honey water if you have a headache. It can help you feel better,” Leng Yuqi said.

“Sure, I need to have a nap. I’ll call you later,” Chu Jianan said, not wanting to talk to Leng Yuqi any longer.

In fact, he lost his patience with her and didn’t care about her that much, but he didn’t have a better choice right now, so he had to stay with Leng Yuqi.

“Um, Jianan, can I ask you about something?” Leng Yuqi asked. She couldn’t relax until she knew everything clearly.

“What is it?” Chu Jianan said. He subconsciously believed it had something to do with Leng Xiaoyao.

“Did you see Leng Xiaoyao yesterday?” Leng Yuqi asked, biting her lower lip. She didn’t want Chu Jianan to think she was suspicious of and mad at him.
