3210 Doesn’t Dare to Lie

Han Yu was somewhat upset when he heard that. “Leng Xiaoyao is still a senior high school student. She’s eight years younger than Li Mochen. How could there be any special relationship between them? They should be normal friends.”

However, Leng Xiaoyao must be very special since she could become Li Mochen’s friend even if they were just normal friends.

“So what? I think an age gap of eight years is still normal. After all, there are couples with a ten-year age gap,” Ji Yanxi countered. He didn’t think it was a big deal.

“That’s not the main problem. Leng Xiaoyao is a senior high school student. She’s not in the same class as Li Mochen, so they can’t be together. Besides, although Li Mochen is powerful, he isn’t reliable. He’s in a very complicated situation,” Han Yu said. He didn’t approve of Li Mochen, so he sounded a little harsh.

“I know Li Mochen is in a complicated situation, but I think he’s able to protect Leng Xiaoyao well. In addition, Leng Xiaoyao isn’t weak,” Ji Yanxi said. Although there was a huge gap between their status, he felt that they were a perfect couple due to their abilities.

Saying that, Ji Yanxi suddenly realized something. “Wait a second, it’s a bit strange.”

“Why?” asked Han Yu.

“It’s their personal matter whether they are a couple. Why are you so emotional? Do you have feelings for Leng Xiaoyao?” Ji Yanxi joked with an evil smile.

After all, Han Yu strongly disapproved of Li Mochen, so he was unavoidably suspicious of him.

If that was true, Ji Yanxi hoped that his close brother would end up together with the girl he liked.

He knew Han Yu very well. Although Han Yu didn’t fall in love easily, he was an extremely loyal boyfriend once he was in love.

Once upon a time, there was a woman who won Han Yu’s love, but she…

Upon thinking of that, Ji Yanxi felt upset. Few people cherished pure love and the woman betrayed Han Yu in the end.

Han Yu panicked a little and frowned. “That’s ridiculous! I’m simply expressing my opinion.”

“Really?” Ji Yanxi asked doubtfully.

“Firstly, I won’t like a girl who’s so much younger than me. Secondly, Leng Yecheng is my friend and his niece is the younger generation. Thirdly, Leng Xiaoyao has outstanding skills and has saved my life, so I appreciate her very much, but that has nothing to do with love.” Han Yu explained seriously and tried to defend himself. He didn’t want Ji Yanxi to misunderstand him.

“I’m joking. Why are you so serious? The more serious you are, the more I will feel you have feelings for her,” Ji Yanxi said. At the beginning, he wasn’t sure, but now he was sure that he was right.

“Whether it’s a joke or not, I think it’s better to explain it to avoid misunderstandings. If I don’t explain it, you might say that I’m admitting it by staying silent. At that time, I’ll be unable to clear my name.” Han Yu rolled his eyes at Ji Yanxi. He didn’t want to continue to talk about it. Without delay, he changed the topic. “Alright, let’s drop that topic and talk about business.”

…

After Leng Xiaoyao and the others left, Zhang Zengxu called He Fangqi and asked him where he was right now, saying that he wanted to meet him.

He Fangqi didn’t know why Zhang Zengxu wanted to see him. After all, Zhang Zengxu had called him after the task was finished. However, He Fangqi still told Zhang Zengxu that he was in a club with his friends.

Afterwards, Leng Xiaoyao and the others went to the club.

When He Fangqi saw Zhang Zengxu walking over with Leng Xiaoyao, he immediately realized that something had gone wrong.

“X-Xu, what are you…” He Fangqi’s voice was trembling. Even if he guessed that his dirty trick was exposed, he still wanted to get away with it. At the same time, he was mad at Zhang Zengxu for ruining it. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have turned to Zhang Zengxu for help.

However, even though he was mad at Zhang Zengxu, he didn’t dare to vent his anger at him. After all, Zhang Zengxu was a gangster. If he angered Zhang Zengxu, he couldn’t bear the result. He couldn’t be as violent as a gangster.

“He Fangqi, I already told Miss Leng everything you wanted me to do to Xiaoyao Technology Company. You better be honest too and pay the compensation, or you can’t bear the result,” Zhang Zengxu said. He didn’t feel guilty at all for betraying He Fangqi. Instead, he blamed He Fangqi for it.

Zhang Zengxu thought that they were punished because of He Fangqi. After all, it was He Fangqi who told them that they didn’t need to be afraid of Leng Xiaoyao after his investigation.

Even though He Fangqi correctly guessed the result when they showed up here, he still couldn’t accept Zhang Zengxu’s betrayal.

“W-What do you mean?” He Fangqi still played dumb.

“What do we mean? Deputy General Manager He, no one is an idiot. I’ve made it very clear. Stop playing dumb. It’s meaningless.” Leng Xiaoyao mocked. “Since you refuse to be honest, let me tell you straightforwardly. The fact that you paid Zhang Zengxu and the other gangsters to smash my company has already been exposed. Is there any grudge between us, Deputy General Manager He? Why do you want to cause me trouble?”

He Fangqi said nothing, struggling to get himself out of this trouble.

His friends, however, were surprised by the fact that He Fangqi paid a bunch of gangsters to smash Xiaoyao Technology Company.

Why? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

All of them were aware that He Fangqi had schemed against Fengyang Technology Company, but now it had a different name and a new boss. Why did He Fangqi still scheme against them?

Besides, Leng Xiaoyao was able to make Zhang Zengxu admit the crime, which proved that she had a powerful background.

Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t mad and continued. “Deputy General Manager He, I’m sure you’re not so dumb as to try to deny it. After all, Zhang Zengxu has already admitted it. It’s meaningless even if you try to deny it. Do you know why he admitted it? I didn’t offer him any benefits, but I’m his manager’s friend, so he doesn’t dare to deny it. Before I found him, I had already figured out the truth. I’m the boss of a technology company, so I can’t be bad at hacking.”

Hearing that, He Fangqi was frightened. To his astonishment, Leng Xiaoyao had a relationship with Ji Yanxi not to mention that he had ignored the fact that she was a skilled hacker. He didn’t clean up the mess and was easily caught.
