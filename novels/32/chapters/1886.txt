Chapter 1887: Shouldn’t You Apologize?

“Rong Zechen, you don’t look guilty at all!” Seeing Rong Zechen’s happy expression, Song Miaoge got angrier and snapped at him.

Hearing that, Rong Zechen was taken aback. He didn’t understand what Song Miaoge meant.

“What do you mean?” Wei Chuanxun opened his mouth at this time in an unkind tone, because he was displeased with Song Miaoge’s attitude.

Song Miaoge said nothing, and Gu Ning walked over.

“Gu Ning, what do you want to talk about with me?” Rong Zechen was obviously excited to see Gu Ning.

Gu Ning, however, looked at Rong Zechen in annoyance. She asked, “Senior Rong, perhaps you’re worried that Yuan Shuyan who likes you might cause me trouble, so you went to question her, but I didn’t tell you that Yuan Shuyan has caused me any trouble. Have you ever considered my feelings? What you’ve done can damage my reputation. It’s now a hot topic in our school forum. Everyone believes that I told you Yuan Shuyan has caused me trouble, but she actually hasn’t. People are all criticizing me for being calculating. I feel quite aggrieved.”

“What?”

Knowing that, Rong Zechen was shocked. It was obvious that he knew nothing about that.

“Sorry, I didn’t expect it to have such a huge impact. I thought that Yuan Shuyan has caused you trouble, so I went to ask her about it.” Rong Zechen apologized at once. He was indeed surprised by the result of his impulsive behavior.

“Even though you didn’t expect this to happen, it indeed has bothered me and damaged my reputation. I think that we better be strangers from now on! I told you I don’t want to be affected by irrelevant people and things,” said Gu Ning. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Hearing that, Rong Zechen was disappointed. He believed that he had treated Gu Ning very well, but she didn’t cherish his affection towards her, which made Rong Zechen start to change his positive feelings to her.

“Gu Ning, Zechen was only worried that Yuan Shuyan might bully you, so he went to ask her about that. You don’t cherish his effort, and you even blame him for that?” Wei Chuanxun was mad, defending Rong Zechen.

This time, Rong Zechen didn’t stop him, because he had the same thought.

Gu Ning frowned and was about to lose her temper.

Many people were already looking at them and more and more people surrounded them after Wei Chuanxun’s shout.

Hearing their conversation and the hot topic in their school forum today, they immediately realized what they were talking about.

When they saw Gu Ning’s annoyed expression, they began to wonder whether the post in their school forum today told the truth.

“You...” Song Miaoge was furious and wanted to say something again, but Baili Zongxue stopped her.

They should leave it to Gu Ning, it was better for them to be quiet.

Song Miaoge also realized it, so she closed her mouth after giving Wei Chuanxun a glare. In her eyes, Wei Chuanxun was even more annoying than Rong Zechen.

Gu Ning turned to coldly look at Wei Chuanxun, which made him tremble in fear. He couldn’t help avoiding Gu Ning’s eyes, because her look was so piercing that he somehow was scared.

Ignoring those onlookers, Gu Ning said to Wei Chuanxun in a cold voice, “Why should I cherish it? I know he went to question Yuan Shuyan out of kindness because he was worried that she might bully me, but I’ve done nothing wrong. Why should I carry the blame in the end? Do I deserve to be criticized by so many people? Can’t I be mad at being slandered? Do I have to accept the result?”

“I...” Wei Chuanxun felt a little guilty hearing that.

Actually, Gu Ning indeed had done nothing wrong, but she was amid criticisms in the end.

“Someone said in the school forum that I like Senior Rong, so I deliberately stirred things up between Senior Yuan and Senior Rong trying to make Senior Rong hate Senior Yuan.” Gu Ning turned to ask Rong Zechen, “Senior Rong, can you tell us whether I’ve told you that Senior Yuan has caused me any trouble?”

Rong Zechen remained silent. He didn’t answer Gu Ning’s question right away, because the answer was negative.

If he told the truth, he had to admit that it was his fault in public. Although it was indeed his fault, he was unwilling to admit it in front of everyone.

Seeing Rong Zechen’s reaction, Gu Ning’s expression became colder. She knew that Rong Zechen was selfish and refused to admit it only to save his own face.

Since he chose to protect himself, Gu Ning continued without waiting for his reply. “Senior Rong, we actually are not familiar with each other. Even if we’ve talked with one another before, it was only a brief talk. It’s impossible that I admire Senior Rong. Senior Rong has countless admirers in our school, but not every girl likes him. Besides, I already have a fiancé. I’m deeply in love with my fiancé, so I’d never like another man.”

Knowing that, everyone rounded his or her eyes in shock. To their astonishment, Gu Ning already had a fiancé.

It wasn’t strange, but was quite surprising.

Rong Zechen was embarrassed, because he believed that Gu Ning didn’t take him seriously. Somehow, Rong Zechen began to be mad at Gu Ning.

Because of Gu Ning’s further explanation, people learned that she wasn’t the kind of girl the post in their school forum described. That post obviously was defaming her.

It was Rong Zechen who went to question Yuan Shuyan of his own accord, but it brought great trouble to Gu Ning afterwards.

As a result, people began to look at Rong Zechen differently, but nobody dared to criticize him for the sake of his background.

All of a sudden, a cold female voice sounded.

“Lord Rong, I think you should take the blame for this drama. Since Gu Ning didn’t say that Yuan Shuyan has caused her any trouble, you’ve damaged her reputation by questioning Yuan Shuyan of your own accord. You did that out of kindness, but Gu Ning was attacked because of you. Shouldn’t you apologize to her?”

Hearing her voice, Gu Ning knew that it must be Zhang Zikai before seeing her face.

Gu Ning didn’t remember that Zhang Zikai was also studying in the Capital University until this moment. However, she hadn’t seen her nor contacted her yet, neither did Zhang Zikai.

Anyway, once she saw Zhang Zikai’s hand wrapped in bandages, she figured out that she had been injured.

Although the Zhang family wasn’t as influential as the Rong family, it didn’t mean that Zhang Zikai was afraid of it and didn’t dare to stand out for justice.

Everyone agreed with Zhang Zikai on her words, but they still chose to be silent.
