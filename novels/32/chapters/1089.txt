Chapter 1092 Encounter Robbers

There was jade of high quality in each of those jade raw materials.When the auction came to the end, the last and most valuable jade raw material was shown on the screen. Gu Ning saw a piece of the King’s Green in it.

Although the King’s Green was at the same level as the old-pit glass jade, its price was much higher.

Even if it wasn’t very large, it was super expensive.

Other people in the hall, however, had no idea how big the King’s Green was inside.

According to its size, Gu Ning estimated it to be worth about 300 million yuan. Therefore, the bidding price should stop at 200 million yuan.

Once the King’s Green was shown, bidders went crazy for it.

Even though the King’s Green was rarely seen, its price could be unreasonably high as well, so Gu Ning remained silent for the time being. She planned to wait and see whether the bidding price would stop at a reasonable place.

Dongfang Ziyu, instead, raised the price up to 250 million yuan. She was reluctant to miss the King’s Green because she sensed strong magical power from it.

Although it wasn’t the highest price the jade could be sold at, Gu Ning gave it up, because it wasn’t worth the effort. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

As a result, Dongfang Ziyu won the King’s Green.

When the auction was over, they went to pay the bill and finish some legal procedures.

Zhang Dequan, Zhao Yuefeng and others walked to Gu Ning once they left the hall. “Miss Gu, when will you go back?” Zhang Dequan asked her.

“Very soon. How about you, Mr. Zhang?” Gu Ning said.

“Me too,” Zhang Dequan replied.

City Teng was very close and they could arrive there in two or three hours. Besides, Burma wasn’t a safe country, so they should go back as soon as possible.

Zhao Yuefeng would leave once he finished the legal procedures too.

There were several windows for people to fill out the documents, so Gu Ning finished the legal procedures after a short while. Although she didn’t have too many jade raw materials, they were too heavy to be carried with her.

The host arranged a MPV for them to deliver them.

...

Gu Ning went back to the hotel to pack her baggage first, then left for City Teng.

Even though Gu Ning had the intention to keep an eye on Dongfang Ziyu, it wasn’t the right time for her to do that right now.

The cultivation world was separated from their world, and normal human beings couldn’t reach it. In that case, even if Gu Ning kept a close eye on Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua, they could still disappear from sight at any second. Moreover, it was very easy for Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua to find out who was following them.

Anyway, Gu Ning had a feeling that they would meet each other again sooner or later.

Ayumi Yamaguchi, at the same time, had to watch Zi Beiying leaving.

Burma wasn’t safe, but not everyone would be caught by danger unless the person had bad luck.

Unfortunately, Gu Ning noticed two strange cars halfway back. One was driving in front of them, while the other was at their back.

She used her Jade Eyes and saw people with guns sitting in the MPV that was not far from them.

They must be either soldiers or robbers, and Gu Ning decided to figure it out.

There were seven of them in the car. Except the driver, each of them had at least a gun, but they were all in casual clothes instead of military uniforms. Besides, they looked evil, and Gu Ning was almost sure that they were robbers.

Two of them in the rear seats turned around to stare at their car once in a while. They were staring at them!

Gu Ning felt nervous, and she was now very certain that they weren’t good people.

Robbers were in the front car. How about the car at their back?

Thinking of that, Gu Ning turned around.

It was a private car at the back, and there were four people in it. Except the driver, the other three people also had a gun with them.

“Gu Ning, what are you looking at?” Zi Beiying and Nan sat on the back row. When Gu Ning gazed into the space, Zi Beiying got curious.

“Nothing.” Gu Ning shook her head. She decided not to tell Zi Beiying right now. Instead, she took out her phone and typed down lines of words at once.

Gu Ning: Shaoting, we’re in danger now. There are seven people in the front MPV. Except the driver, the other six men all have at least one gun with them. The private car at the back is also a threat. There are four in it. Except the driver, the other three people all have a gun with them. I don’t think they’re soldiers. They must be robbers.

After that, Gu Ning gave her phone to Leng Shaoting. Leng Shaoting was aware that she had Jade Eyes, so he wasn’t surprised by her message.

The moment Leng Shaoting read the message, he was shocked and put on a serious expression.

They had to figure out a way to get rid of those robbers. Only Leng Shaoting, Gu Ning, and Zi Beiying had guns. Leng Shaoting was a senior soldier, so he was allowed to carry a gun with him. Gu Ning had the telepathic eye space to help her store guns. Zi Beiying, however, was born in a munitioner family, so she owned a special gun that could pass any security check.

The quantity of the special gun was strictly limited, and it wasn’t available on the open market. Only the key members of the Zi family could own one.

Even though Leng Shaoting and Zi Shaomin were close friends, he could only give Leng Shaoting the best gun which was available on the market.
