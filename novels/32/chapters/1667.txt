Meng Zhengde and his wife confirmed that Jing Yuyao was Yunyao after she told them the story. They were also willing to help her get her memories back.

“Mr. Meng, did Yunyao live here too?” Gu Ning asked Meng Zhengde.

“Yes, before Yunyao married into the Leng family, she lived here for a year. Although she got married, the Ye family still kept her room here. It’s still the same now!” said Meng Zhengde. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Can we have a look?” asked Gu Ning.

“Sure!” Meng Zhengde agreed without hesitation.

“Please follow me this way,” said Meng Zhengde.

“Housekeeper Meng, please allow me to walk at the front. I want to see whether I can find the room by myself,” said Jing Yunyao.

“No problem.” Meng Zhengde agreed.

Therefore, Jing Yunyao walked at the front, followed by Gu Ning, Meng Zhengde and Mrs. Meng.

Jing Yunyao went to the second floor later. She looked around, then went up to the third floor. There were four rooms on the third floor, and Jing Yunyao stopped outside the second from the right.

At this time, Meng Zhengde and Mrs. Meng exchanged a glance again, because this room was actually Yunyao’s room.

“I think it must be this one,” said Jing Yunyao.

“You’re right,” said Meng Zhengde. After that, he pushed the door open for Jing Yunyao and they walked inside one after another.

Everything stayed the same in the room, but the furniture was covered by white cloth now.

Meng Zhengde and his wife lifted the white cloth to let Jing Yunyao see the room clearly.

Jing Yunyao looked around for a long time, but unfortunately she remembered nothing.

Afterwards, Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao helped Meng Zhengde cover the furniture with white cloth before they left.

Before they left, Jing Yunyao reminded Meng Zhengde and his wife not to tell Leng Shaoting that she had been here for the time being.

Meng Zhengde and Mrs. Meng watched Gu Ning’s car moving away in their sight. They didn’t go back in the house until Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao totally disappeared.

“Do you think she’s really Yunyao?” asked Mrs. Meng.

“I think she is, but we must be patient till she gets all of her memories back,” said Meng Zhengde.

Since they promised Jing Yunyao not to tell Leng Shaoting that she had been here, they wouldn’t say anything about it.

...

Jing Yunyao was actually a little upset after they left the Ye family’s old house, but she pretended to be calm in case Gu Ning was worried about her.

“Mother, why don’t we go to Hengdian World Studios now? There is a crew from Fenghua Entertainment filming a new show,” said Gu Ning.

The shooting of An Empress of Military Blood was about to come to an end, and Gu Ning had only visited it twice till now.

“Sure.” Jing Yunyao nodded.

Ten minutes later, Gu Ning and Jing Yunyao arrived at Hengdian World Studios and Gu Ning gave Lu Zhan a call later.

At this moment, Lu Zhan was really angry, because an actress didn’t do her job well in an important scene today.

In the scene, the actress’s role was the Goddess of Medicine of the Medicine King Valley, and she was a beautiful kung fu master.

In the story, she showed up by flying over from the bottom of the cliff and saved the leading actress who wanted to commit suicide by jumping from the cliff.

They filmed at a real cliff for the quality of the show. However, this actress’s hand was injured, so she couldn’t catch the leading actress, which annoyed Lu Zhan.

Because she was injured, they had to replace her right now.

Although it wasn’t an important role in the show, it required a skilled actor. The setting was already down, so they couldn’t give it up and jump to the next scene.

Lu Zhan didn’t know what to do now, but he suddenly received Gu Ning’s call.

“Hi, boss?” said Lu Zhan.

“Where are you right now? I’m driving by Hengdian World Studios. Can I have a short visit?” asked Gu Ning.

“Sure, we’re in District F,” said Lu Zhan.

“Great, I’ll be right there,” said Gu Ning and hung up the call.

Lu Zhan suddenly had an idea that Gu Ning would be perfect for the role.

“What’s wrong?” Lu Yichen asked Lu Zhan with curiosity.

“Nothing, we can have a rest for 10 minutes,” said Lu Zhan.

He needed to ask for Gu Ning’s permission in taking over the role of Goddess of Medicine, so he could say nothing about it now. However, if Gu Ning played the role in the show, she might overshadow the leading actress.

Anyway, he needed Gu Ning’s agreement first.

Lu Yichen thought that Lu Zhan must have found a suitable actor for the role, or he wouldn’t be so happy.
