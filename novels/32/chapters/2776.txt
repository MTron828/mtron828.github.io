Chapter 2778: Do You Like Leng Shaoming Too?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Because Leng Shaoming was a good friend of the club’s owner, the manager gave them a special treatment.

“Mr. Leng, do you want to have the meal right now?” The manager asked Leng Shaoming.

“No need to rush. We want to row a boat first,” said Leng Shaoming.

“Great, let me take you there,” said the manager, then he took Leng Shaoming and Zhan Zhiyin to the boats.

It was still early, but it was a weekend and they had just opened the club so it was fresh and popular.

They charged a lot for the services, but the prices were reasonable, so many people still chose to use them.

After all, consumers didn’t come here very often.

Accordingly, there were many people rowing boats on the lake.

Because the club owner was Leng Shaoming’s good friend, Leng Shaoming knew his friends too.

Since they were all friends, the club owner’s friends ought to come to support him. Therefore, not only Leng Shaoming, but many other friends of the club owner also came to have fun today. As a result, when Leng Shaoming and Zhan Zhiyin went to go take a boat, they saw several familiar faces.

There were two men and three women at the same age as Leng Shaoming. All of them were good-looking.

Because they were familiar, they exchanged greetings.

A woman saw Leng Shaoming first, and her face lit up the moment she saw him. However, as soon as she saw Zhan Zhiyin next to Leng Shaoming, she looked displeased, but after a few seconds, she went back to normal and put on a smile. She walked to Leng Shaoming and greeted him. “Mr. Leng, so nice to see you! What a coincidence!”

Saying that, she turned to watch Zhan Zhiyin with obvious hostility in her eyes. “Is she your girlfriend, Mr. Leng?” She asked Leng Shaoming.

Zhan Zhiyin could see the woman’s hostility towards her, and had a feeling that this woman liked Leng Shaoming.

When the woman asked Leng Shaoming whether she was his girlfriend, Zhan Zhiyin felt nervous. She wondered what Leng Shaoming would say!

“Hi, Miss Chen, this is my girlfriend.” Leng Shaoming clearly knew what the woman was thinking, but his reply had nothing to do with that. He had already made up his mind to date Zhan Zhiyin and he had prepared a serious confession for that.

Anyway, since Miss Chen asked about that, he couldn’t deny it.

When Zhan Zhiyin heard Leng Shaoming’s reply, her heart raced.

Hearing Leng Shaoming’s answer, Miss Chen was unhappy. Although she composed herself, she couldn’t hide her real emotions.

“Well, I didn’t expect you to have a girlfriend within just a week. She’s very beautiful. Congratulations, Mr. Leng,” said Miss Chen insincerely.

She indeed liked Leng Shaoming, and wanted to ride on his coattails, but unfortunately Leng Shaoming already had a girlfriend.

Although she clearly knew that this woman met Leng Shaoming before her, she was still unhappy.

“Thanks.” Leng Shaoming thanked her.

“Oh, Mr. Leng, you and your girl are out today?”

At this time, other people who were with Miss Chen also saw Leng Shaoming and greeted him.

“Yeah!” Leng Shaoming said, “Well, if you’ll excuse me, we need to go now.”

“Sure, please,” they said. They didn’t dare to bother Leng Shaoming.

After that, Leng Shaoming left, holding Zhan Zhiyin’s hand.

When they were far away, those people immediately turned to stare at Miss Chen, who looked mad.

“Oh, he already has a girlfriend now. I don’t think you have a chance,” one of the women said to Miss Chen, gloating over her bad luck.

Hearing that, Miss Chen gave her a glare, then said mockingly, “I don’t have a chance. So do you?”

The woman panicked a little and argued at once. “What do you mean? We all know that you like him. It has nothing to do with me!”

“Don’t think it’s a secret. I know you like Leng Shaoming too,” said Miss Chen.

Hearing that, one of the two men was upset, but he said nothing.

There was only one couple among the two men and three women, but the other man was chasing the girl Miss Chen just laughed at.

However, the woman didn’t give him a clear answer. Although she also admired Leng Shaoming, she didn’t show her affection towards Leng Shaoming as obviously as Miss Chen. She didn’t let other people know about it either, but unfortunately, Miss Chen found out.

“I don’t. That’s slander!” The woman angrily argued. Even though she admired Leng Shaoming from afar, she wouldn’t say it aloud. After all, her admirer was present right now. If she admitted it, he might stop chasing her.

Although she wouldn’t accept him, he was her plan-B. If she didn’t have a better choice, she would accept him. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“It’s not slander and you know it,” said Miss Chen.

“You…” The woman’s face distorted in anger. “Chen Siyu, that’s too much!”

“Alright, stop arguing now. Since we’re out for fun, we should be harmonious. Don’t be the wet blanket. Let’s go row the boats!” The woman, who was quiet the entire time, suddenly interrupted them. She was reluctant to see them arguing because both of them were her friends, and she didn’t want to ruin their trip today.

As for their argument, she thought both of them were right. If the woman didn’t laugh at Chen Siyu first, Chen Siyu wouldn’t expose her secret. Therefore, she blamed neither of them.

Unexpectedly, she also liked Leng Shaoming.

In fact, Leng Shaoming was so outstanding and was born in the Leng family in the capital. It was hard for women not to like him. However, neither of them matched Leng Shaoming, so they shouldn’t have much hope.

The woman was unwilling to stop, but said nothing further. Anyway, she didn’t know what she could say now.

Chen Siyu didn’t say anything either. In fact, if the woman didn’t gloat over her bad luck, she wouldn’t have exposed her secret. If she wanted to do that, she would have done it long ago.
