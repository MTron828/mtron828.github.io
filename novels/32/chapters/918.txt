919 A Strange Figure

Because this song was very suitable for their TV series, they wanted to buy it as the insert music in the show.

Insert music didn’t sound very important, but it actually appeared throughout the show more often than the opening song and the ending song did. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Many people preferred to watch TV shows on the Internet nowadays, and they would normally fast-forward to the show without watching its beginning.

Sometimes, the opening song or the ending song would also be used as the insert music, so it depended on the quality of the song whether it could be popular.

Xia Yichu was signed by Fenghua Entertainment, and Xia Yidong cared about his older sister’s career, so the director had to ask for Fenghua Entertainment’s agreement. As for the singer, it had to be Xia Yichu.

Afterwards, the director discussed it with Fenghua Entertainment.

There was no reason for Fenghua Entertainment to turn the offer down, so they were meeting today to talk about the details.

Although Fenghua Entertainment would protect its artists from harmful unspoken rules, it was necessary for them to show up at some gatherings.

Xia Yichu was a singer who hadn’t had her debut yet, so she had to seize every opportunity to gain attention. If she didn’t show up, it might leave a bad impression on those who had the intention to cooperate with her.

Once her reputation was damaged, her career would be ruined.

In fact, it was enough if Xia Yichu and her agent went there, but Lu Xiao said that he was going with them too, which surprised them.

“Manager Lu, why are you going with us?” Xia Yichu couldn’t believe her ears.

“Can’t I?” Lu Xiao frowned.

“Of course, but...” Xia Yichu said at once.

It wasn’t a big deal, and there was no need for Lu Xiao, who was the general manager of the company, to go there in person.

What she didn’t know was that Lu Xiao went there because of her. Lu Xiao fell in love with Xia Yichu before he even realized it.

Even though there were no unspoken rules in Fenghua Entertainment, their clients might do something inappropriate, so he was worried about Xia Yichu’s safety.

Xia Yichu’s agent noticed something, but she wasn’t sure about it. Xia Yichu’s agent was a woman who was assigned by Lu Xiao too. He was unwilling to arrange a man to work with Xia Yichu.

It was around 5:30 pm when Gu Ning got back to the Gonghao Hotel, so she booked a private room without delay.

After that, she planned to call Leng Shaoting, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya. When she had just turned, she saw He Siyin.

He Siyin walked into the hotel with two of her friends, and she noticed Gu Ning as well.

He Siyin was surprised to see Gu Ning, because she thought that Gu Ning would directly fly back to City B after going to City M.

“Hi, I thought that you would directly fly back to City B after going to City M. Do you need to deal with something else in HK?” He Siyin walked to Gu Ning at once.

“Yeah, but it’s already done, and I’m leaving for City B tomorrow morning,” Gu Ning said with a smile.

“Have you eaten? Why don’t we dine together?” He Siyin asked.

“Not yet, but I already booked a private room and will be dining with my friends,” Gu Ning said.

“Fine.” He Siyin didn’t insist. “How about tonight? If you’re free, you can have some fun with us at my family’s clubhouse.”

“Thanks, but we need a good rest tonight because we have to go to the airport early in the morning tomorrow.” Gu Ning declined again.

“Well, do visit HK again if you’re free in the future,” He Siyin said in the end.

“I will,” Gu Ning replied.

After that, they separated.

Gu Ning then called Leng Shaoting, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya to tell them to dine together.

After ordering the dishes, Gu Ning told Qiao Ya to book plane tickets for them.

It was only a little past 7 pm when they finished dinner, and Gu Ning along with Leng Shaoting went for a ride outside.

Gu Ning wanted to enjoy the beach, so Leng Shaoting borrowed a car from the hotel and they left for the seaside.

There were too many people on the beach near the center of the city, so they went to a place farther away from the crowd. The farther they walked along the coast, the quieter it was.

Leng Shaoting stopped the car by the roadside, then walked on the beach holding Gu Ning’s hand.

“Shaoting, can I ask you something?” Gu Ning said.

Hearing Gu Ning’s serious tone, Leng Shaoting got nervous. “Sure.”

“Well, I have many real antiques with me now, and I don’t think it’s very profitable to run an antique store, so I plan to open a private museum. I can sell tickets and real antiques at the same time, but you know I got most of those real antiques by grave-digging. It’s illegal and a big problem, so do you have any ways to solve it?”

“It’s easy,” Leng Shaoting said without hesitation. “We don’t need to tell the authorities the truth, and we can also donate some pieces to the national museum to show our kindness. I think the government will permit it.”

Hearing that, Gu Ning nodded. “Please help me with it.”

“No problem,” Leng Shaoting said. He was more than willing to help Gu Ning.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting walked a long distance, and it became darker because there weren’t any street lights.

When they were about to walk back, something strange happened.

A black figure flashed by the nearby woods like lightning, which an ordinary person couldn’t do. Not only was it strange, but it was also creepy.

Gu Ning suddenly had a premonition, and told Leng Shaoting to go over with her.

Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting ran much faster than ordinary people, but they were still slower than the black figure. Within several seconds, the distance between them and the black figure became longer.
