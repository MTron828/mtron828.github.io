Chapter 165 It’s None of Your Business If I’m in Love

A while later, Hao Ran and the boys arrived in twos and threes with many bags of nourishing products, which shocked Yu Mixi and her father.

Yu Mixi was fine with it, because she had witnessed it once when they had come to visit Gu Man, but her father had never seen so many gifts at a time.

Why were all of Mixi’s friends are from good families? Yu Mixi’s father was slightly worried. He was afraid that his daughter made those friends for advantages. However, he didn’t show his worry. He kept thanking them for their kindness.

Twenty minutes later, the light went off in the operating room, which meant that the surgery was over. A group of them ran ahead at once.

The door was opened, and the doctor stepped out. “Doctor, how’s my wife?”

“Doctor, how’s my mother?”

Yu Mixi and her father asked with anxiety.

“The surgery is a great success. She’ll wake up when the anesthetic wears off,” the doctor replied.

Everyone was relieved.

They then pushed the patient back to the patient room.

Gu Ning let Hao Ran and Qin Zixun buy some food for Yu Mixi and her parents when they arrived at the VIP patient room. Yu Mixi’s father immediately stopped them. He didn’t want to bother them further. Instead, he planned to let Yu Mixi invite them to have a meal to thank them, but Gu Ning declined.

Gu Ning persuaded Yu Mixi’s father to focus on taking care of Yu Mixi’s mother. Yu Mixi’s mother for now was the one who needed care the most after all.

Yu Mixi’s father listened to Gu Ning in the end.

Hao Ran and Qin Zixun of course followed Gu Ning’s order.

At that time, Gu Ning walked to the side of Yu Mixi’s mother’s bed. She used her Jade Eyes to check her physical condition.

Gu Ning had absorbed a large amount of power, and she was already able to cure the human body to some extent with her power, but for severe injuries, her power still wasn’t enough.

The tumor was already removed from Yu Mixi’s mother’s head. The only injury she had was the cut left by the surgery. Gu Ning administered some power, a light white fog that ordinary people couldn’t see, into the cut to only cure the flesh inside, to prevent someone from finding out. Outside, the cut remained the same, but it wouldn’t affect the inside part any more.

It didn’t cost much power to do so, so Gu Ning continued to check Yu Mixi’s mother’s body to see what else she could do. She was willing to do more for her friend.

It was good that Gu Ning did, because Yu Mixi’s mother’s stomach was already festering, which was probably the reason why she had been frail and sick for so many years!

Gu Ning immediately used her power to cure the damaged stomach. This time she spent a lot of power, and felt a little tired afterwards. Luckily, there was still half of her power left.

No one noticed what she was doing, because it happened too fast.

Half an hour later, the two boys got back with the food. Gu Ning and others didn’t stay long before they left.

Gu Ning had planned to do her scavenger hunt at the Yuntai Mountain today, but it was too late, so she gave it up.

When Gu Ning and the boys were gone, Yu Mixi told her father what Gu Ning had discussed with her. She didn’t want her father to be worried about her mother’s health as well as the money.

Yu Mixi’s father was stunned to hear the news. To his astonishment, Gu Ning was able to start a business at such a young age.

Although Gu Ning did so, he still felt like he had to do something. However, his family was too poor to pay the money back. Thus Yu Mixi’s father could only reminded Yu Mixi to study hard so that she could help Gu Ning in the future. Gu Ning had saved her mother’s life after all.

If Gu Ning hadn’t come to their aid, Yu Mixi’s mother could only have waited to die.

The next day, Gu Ning saw Leng Shaoting in a black suit waiting for her not far away, just as she just left zone G.

Leng Shaoting’s sudden presence surprised Gu Ning, but she was also slightly thrilled.

Why is he here? What is he doing here? Is he here for me? Why is he coming to me? A series of questions flashed by Gu Ning’s mind. She suddenly realized that she was still mad at him.

Therefore, she ignored him walking straight by him.

Leng Shaoting was a little upset and nervous. He immediately stopped her. “Wait.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Gu Ning wanted to continue walking ahead, but in the end she stopped. “What?”

“I believe that you’re too young to fall in love now. You should focus more on your studies,” Leng Shaoting said. He was anxious.

What? Gu Ning was annoyed. He comes here to remind me to stay away from romance just because I’m young? How can he do that?

Gu Ning turned around raising her voice and shouted at him, “It’s none of your business if I’m in love! Who do you think you are? Mind yourself first please! I heard that you have never even had a girlfriend. Are you a gay or something?”

After that, Gu Ning directly walked fast away.

Leng Shaoting was struck dumb. He didn’t understand why Gu Ning was so irritated. He did this for her good! He indeed had never ever had a girlfriend, because there was no woman who could walk into his heart, but he wasn’t a gay either.

In case Gu Ning misunderstood, Leng Shaoting caught her up at once. “I’m not a gay.”

“I don’t care,” Gu Ning replied in anger.

“I’m really not a gay,” Leng Shaoting continued to explain.

“I told you I don’t care...” Gu Ning said. She stopped all of a sudden, but didn’t expect that Leng Shaoting was right behind her. He hit Gu Ning’s back unexpectedly.

“Ah!” Gu Ning lost her balance falling forward.

Luckily, with his outstanding agility, Leng Shaoting grabbed her waist, pulling her backwards. Gu Ning’s back once again hit Leng Shaoting’s muscular chest. And, she accidentally touched the man’s sensitive part. It reacted even.

Both of them changed their faces.

Although Gu Ning had been with Qi Ziyue for four years in her previous incarnation, they had never slept together, so Gu Ning was still a virgin.

As for Leng Shaoting, he was absolutely a virgin too.
