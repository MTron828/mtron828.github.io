Chapter 2784: Why Did You Panic?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Chen Yunheng left at 12 am, followed by Zhan Zhiyin.

Zhan Zhiyin followed Chen Yunheng till his apartment, not afraid of being caught by surveillance cameras. She stepped into the elevator after him, but she deliberately kept a distance behind him and only rushed inside after making sure that Chen Yunheng pressed the floor button.

Zhan Zhiyin saw the button of the 19th floor was light, so she randomly pressed the 26th floor.

Chen Yunheng couldn’t see anything wrong with Zhan Zhiyin, because he seldom came here. He didn’t even know his neighbors next door, let alone other residents in this building.

At the 19th floor, he walked out of the elevator, and Zhan Zhiyin immediately followed him.

Because Chen Yunheng was drunk and felt a little dizzy, he didn’t notice Zhan Zhiyin was following him. Afterwards, he opened the door of his apartment.

As soon as the door opened, Zhan Zhiyin went over and pushed Chen Yunheng into the apartment. The next moment, she closed the door behind her.

Chen Yunheng was scared, but he figured it out the moment he saw that it was Zhan Zhiyin who followed him all the way up through the elevator.

“Who are you? What do you want?” Chen Yunheng angrily questioned. Because it was just a woman, he wasn’t frightened. He was only surprised by her sudden actions.

“You don’t need to know who I am. I just want to ask you a few questions,” said Zhan Zhiyin in a lowered voice.

“I don’t know you. You shouldn’t stay here. If you don’t go out right now. Don’t blame me for chasing you out!” Chen Yunheng threatened in anger.

“I’m afraid you can’t,” said Zhan Zhiyin. Before Chen Yunheng could do anything to her, she attacked him.

Before Chen Yunheng react Zhan Zhiyin had already controlled him. After he came back to his senses, he was astonished and struggled heavily. Unfortunately, no matter how he struggled, he couldn’t get rid of her.

Chen Yunheng was extremely surprised by Zhan Zhiyin’s strength.

Because he failed to get away, Chen Yunheng snapped at her. “Let me go!”

“Do you think I’ll listen to you?” Zhan Zhiyin sneered.

“He…” Chen Yunheng realized he couldn’t get rid of Zhan Zhiyin by himself, so he immediately shouted for help, but the moment he opened his mouth, Zhan Zhiyin squeezed his cheeks to stop him from making any sounds.

“You better be quiet. I’ll just ask you a few questions. If you honestly answer it, I won’t hurt you, but if you dare to play tricks, you’ll get hurt. Don’t doubt my words. Since I dare to come, I’m clearly not afraid of the police.” Zhan Zhiyin threatened him.

Chen Yunheng was unhappy at being threatened like that, but he was left with no choice because this woman was very strong.

If she just wanted to ask him a few questions, he decided to hear what she wanted to ask first.

However, Zhan Zhiyin was squeezing his cheeks so he couldn’t speak at all. He could only quietly look at her to show that he would listen to her.

Zhan Zhiyin could see it, so she loosened her hand on the man’s cheeks.

Although Chen Yunheng could talk now, he didn’t dare to struggle or fight back because of Zhan Zhiyin’s abilities. “What’s your question?”

“Is Wu Xiaoli your girlfriend?” asked Zhan Zhiyin.

Chen Yunheng didn’t understand why she asked him that, but it wasn’t a secret, so he replied honestly. “Yes.”

“Were you together last night?” asked Zhan Zhiyin.

Hearing that, Chen Yunheng thought she came because of Wu Xiaoli, but Wu Xiaoli was indeed with him last night. “Yeah.”

“Did you order someone to knock into Leng Shaoming’s car?” asked Zhan Zhiyin.

Chen Yunheng was shocked and panicked. “No, I didn’t.” He denied at once.

However, even though Chen Yunheng denied it, his reaction said everything. It had something to do with him, otherwise he wouldn’t panic like that.

“Why did you panic?” Zhan Zhiyin sneered.

Chen Yunheng had to force himself to calm down, but it only further proved that he was guilty.

“I didn’t. It has nothing to do with me! Don’t hurl the blame on innocent people. I can sue you!” Chen Yunheng argued loudly. As if the louder he argued the truer his words would be.

“But Wu Xiaoli was in the hospital last night. Why did you tell me that she was with you?” asked Zhan Zhiyin.

Chen Yunheng suddenly didn’t know what to say. Unexpectedly, they found out about Wu Xiaoli and were even suspicious of him.

“What? Why don’t you say something?” asked Zhan Zhiyin meaningfully. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“She was absent for a while last night, but she came back later,” said Chen Yunheng, but the moment he said it, he realized that it wasn’t right. However, he couldn’t tell why.

“No, Wu Xiaoli wasn’t with you last night. She went back home,” said Zhan Zhiyin.

Hearing that, Chen Yunheng finally realized why he felt it wasn’t right.

Wu Xiaoli indeed wasn’t with him last night, and this woman must know where Wu Xiaoli went after visiting the hospital. If he told her that Wu Xiaoli came back later, he was obviously lying.

Suddenly, Chen Yunheng thought of the mistake Zhan Zhiyin just made and asked, “You didn’t ask me a specific time of last night. I was with her earlier, but we separated later.”

“Well, you’re not dumb, but I don’t believe your words now.” Zhan Zhiyin sneered. Even though he caught the mistake she made, his reaction already betrayed him.

“Tell me, did you order Wu Ming to knock into Leng Shaoming’s car? However, Leng Shaoming survived, so you ordered Wu Xiaoli to drug him?” asked Zhan Zhiyin.

“No, I didn’t. It wasn’t me. I’m innocent!” Chen Yunheng denied it at once. At the same time, he criticized Zhan Zhiyin angrily. He definitely wouldn’t admit it even though they knew it was him.
