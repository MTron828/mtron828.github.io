Chapter 2850: Unreasonable People

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Um…” Master Chang’s second son didn’t know what to say.

Finally, someone couldn’t stand it any longer. “Sir, you should know that we’re in trouble because of the Chang family. Although they deserve the punishment because they have done illegal things, we wouldn’t have been deeply investigated if it hadn’t been for the Chang family. However, you’re still hiding the truth from us. How can we continue to support you?”

The others had the same idea, but felt embarrassed to say it. Now that one of them pointed it out, they immediately followed.

“Right, we relied on the Chang family to be promoted to our positions today, but we’ve done a lot for you too. Now we’re all in danger. Shouldn’t you tell us why? Are we just pawns in your eyes? We don’t need to know anything, we must just obey your orders?”

“We side with the Chang family, but we’re not your slaves. Since it has something to do with the trouble we’re involved in these days, you should fill us in.”

“I agree. Sir, if you won’t be honest with us, I’m afraid I will have to stop supporting the Chang family.”

“…”

Hearing that, Master Chang’s second son was angry, because they were indeed just pawns in the Chang family’s eyes. They shouldn’t ask him about the reason. He only wanted them to obey orders.

However, he didn’t dare to say that, especially at this moment.

After what had happened to the Chang family, the Chang family had lost a lot of influence. Their supporters were even thinking about changing their attitudes. If Master Chang’s second son still refused to be honest, they would really stop supporting the Chang family.

“Fine, I can tell you that what has happened to Leng Shaoming was caused by the Chang family,” said Master Chang’s second son. That was all he knew.

“What? Was it really done by the Chang family?”

Hearing that, everyone was slightly surprised. They had actually thought that it might have something to do with the Chang family, but they hadn’t been sure.

“Isn’t Leng Shaoming fine now? Why couldn’t the Leng family stop causing the Chang family trouble? They’re too cruel.”

Because they sided with the Chang family, they didn’t think the Chang family was wrong.

Although it was very normal for the Leng family to want to pay the Chang family back, they still felt the Leng family was too cruel. After all, Leng Shaoming was safe now.

“Perhaps the Leng family has targeted the Chang family. It’s just an excuse.”

“Sir, are you sure that’s the only reason?” someone asked. He couldn’t believe that it was so simple.

“Sorry, that’s all I know,” said Master Chang’s second. Saying that, he suddenly felt that his father and older brother might be hiding something from him.

It was possible, so he was displeased.

After hanging up, Master Chang’s eldest son was too anxious to stay calm. He had no idea how much the Leng family knew about what they had done.

Either way, the Leng family seemed to want to make the Chang family pay a heavy price for their actions.

…

On the weekend, Leng Shaoting came back. He wasn’t involved in punishing the Chang family. He decided to leave it to the Dai family. Only if the Dai family needed help would he stand out.

However, the next day after Leng Shaoting came back, Gu Ning received Zheng Peng’s call. Zheng Peng told her that something went wrong at the construction site.

When they dug out raw jade materials, some of them might be broken and there was often quality jade.

Somehow the news went abroad and they lost many raw jade materials once in a while.

Even though they set up cameras, those thieves showed up fully-covered at night every time. They were in the barren mountains, so it was impossible for them to catch the thieves.

Zheng Peng had already called the police, but he wasn’t sure whether the police could catch those thieves. Anyway, they suffered a great loss, so he felt that Gu Ning should know about it.

Knowing that, Gu Ning was mad. She couldn’t tolerate it when someone dared to steal her stuff.

Because she had nothing important to deal with right now, she decided to go to City Rui. After all, there was a lot of quality jade in those raw jade materials, she couldn’t bear the loss.

Leng Shaoting wanted to go with Gu Ning, but Gu Ning turned him down. The Leng family was at a key moment right now, so she felt it was better for Leng Shaoting to stay in the capital.

Leng Shaoting was unhappy with that and argued. “If I stay in the capital, I still need to go back to the military base tomorrow. If I go with you, then I don’t need to go back.”

“The military base isn’t far from the capital. If the Leng family needs you, you can quickly help them,” said Gu Ning.

“Don’t you have trust in mom and our master?” said Leng Shaoting. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“You…” Gu Ning was struck dumb for a moment. “Of course I have trust in them, but you’re helpful too!” she said resignedly.

“If anything really goes wrong, they can go to the cultivation world for help. I can’t receive signal in the military base most of the time. I have to train deep in the mountains most of the time,” said Leng Shaoting. He cared about the Leng family, but he believed Jing Yunyao and Shangguan Yang could handle it.

Gu Ning opened her mouth, but said nothing.

“If you don’t agree, I’ll just follow you secretly,” Leng Shaoting said like a naughty kid. It wasn’t easy for him to see Gu Ning, but she had to leave for work. They wouldn’t be able to see each other again for a few days, so he was unhappy.

“You…” Gu Ning was struck dumb again. “Why are you suddenly becoming so unreasonable?”

“Please,” said Leng Shaoting.

Because Leng Shaoting insisted, Gu Ning gave in.

Afterwards, Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting booked plane tickets to City Rui for that afternoon.

When they arrived at City Rui, it was already dark outside. Zheng Peng was waiting for them at the airport.

Although it was dark already, it was only about 7:30 pm.

“Boss, sorry to bother you. I’m terribly sorry that I didn’t deal with it properly,” Zheng Peng said, feeling guilty.

“No need to say that. If you can’t find them, the thief must be skilled. It could be a thief team,” said Gu Ning.

Zheng Peng was very good at business, but wasn’t as outstanding in other aspects. After all, he was only an ordinary man.

They had lost many raw jade materials, but Zheng Peng hadn’t caught anybody, which meant the thief was very cunning.

Even though Gu Ning didn’t blame him, Zheng Peng still felt guilty, but he understood that his abilities were limited, so he didn’t blame himself too much.
