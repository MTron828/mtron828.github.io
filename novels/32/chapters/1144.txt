Chapter 1146 Zhou Zhenghong“s Shameless Relatives

A Maserati was enough for Zhou Zhenghong.Actually, not every rich person would drive a luxurious car. For example, Gu Ning seldom drove the Lamborghini that the Tang family gave her. She drove a Land Rover more often, which cost much less than a million yuan. Sometimes, the richer a person was, the more he wanted to keep a low profile.

However, Zhou Zhenghong was the general manager of Jade Beauty Jewelry after all, so it was necessary for him to have a good car for the sake of his face. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

In fact, even if Gu Ning didn’t buy it for him, Zhou Zhenghong could afford it himself. He would have his share of the dividend of Jade Beauty Jewelry at the end of the year.

Other than that, Jade Beauty Jewelry had made a lot of profit during the past months, and Zhou Zhenghong had earned over ten million yuan now.

As Jade Beauty Jewelry became more and more famous, its sales would be higher and higher too. In that case, Zhou Zhenghong’s annual dividend wouldn’t be less than fifty million yuan. Therefore, it wasn’t difficult for Zhou Zhenghong to buy a house in the capital.

Nevertheless, Zhou Zhenghong disliked a large house, because only him and his son were in their home. He had no intention to marry again, because he was afraid that a step-mother wouldn’t treat his son well.

“Great, we...” When Gu Ning was about to say something again, Zhou Zhenghong’s phone rang.

Gu Ning had to close her mouth.

“I’m so sorry, boss. I need to answer the call.” Zhou Zhenghong apologized to Gu Ning and took out his phone at once. He was worried that it might be work. However, when he saw the caller’s name, he was displeased but he still picked up after thinking for a short while.

“Hi, Zhenghong, this is your older brother,” a man said. “Um, you know Mingkang is going to be married.”

“When? I’ll see whether I’m free that day,” Zhou Zhenghong said.

Although he already kept a distance from his brother and sister, he wouldn’t mind showing up at his nephew’s wedding.

“Well...” The man hesitated for a second, then continued, “The girl’s family wants a downtown house which can’t be smaller than 100 square-meters, and a car which must be around 500 thousand yuan.”

“That’s your family’s affairs. Why are you telling me this?” Zhou Zhenghong pretended to be confused, but he actually understood it very well. His eldest brother simply wanted his money.

“We don’t have that much money,” Zhou Zhengtang said.

“Don’t buy it then,” Zhou Zhenghong said.

Zhou Zhengtang knew that Zhou Zhenghong was pretending to be dumb. Even though he was annoyed, he didn’t dare to blame Zhou Zhenghong.

“If we don’t buy a house and a car, the girl won’t marry into my family,” Zhou Zhengtang said.

“Why do you have to choose a girl who wants a big house and an expensive car? In addition, you already have a house and a car. Although the house isn’t very big and the car isn’t expensive, they’re enough for a family,” Zhou Zhenghong said.

Actually, Zhou Zhengtang’s family’s house and car were both paid for by Zhou Zhenghong.

Although their house was a little far from the city center, it was large enough to accommodate five people. And while their car was a little old, it was still useful.

Zhou Zhengtang’s family didn’t lack a house or a car, but were simply greedy.

When Zhou Zhenghong’s company was still profitable, he had bought a house and a car for his brother and sister, which cost him nearly six million yuan. However, once his company went bankrupt, they avoided seeing him.

Zhou Zhenghong just wanted them to take care of his son for a short time, but they refused to do that and even refused to answer his calls. They had broken Zhou Zhenghong’s heart.

Not long ago, they heard that Zhou Zhenghong became the general manager of Jade Beauty Jewelry, so they began to call him again.

...

Zhou Zhengtang didn’t know what to say, because Zhou Zhenghong was right. His family wasn’t poor at all.

Zhou Zhengtang and his wife worked in a state-owned enterprise, and each of them earned nearly ten thousand yuan a month.

Zhou Mingkang, who was Zhou Zhengtang’s son, was also working in a public institution, and he earned a monthly salary of six thousand yuan which could increase in the future.

Moreover, Zhou Mingkang’s girlfriend was in the same public institution as him, so their salaries were almost the same.

As a result, it wasn’t hard for them to buy a house on their own, but the house wouldn’t be big. They could only afford a good car with their savings.

In the past, even though Zhou Zhenghong wouldn’t pay the full price, he would still pay the down payment for them. However, it was impossible for them to get a cent out of his pocket now.

Zhou Zhengtang said, “Zhenghong, to be honest with you, I know you’re much richer than us. Mingkang is your nephew anyway, and you can give him a house and a car as his uncle since he’s going to be married.”

Zhou Zhengtang was shameless.

Zhou Mingkang was indeed Zhou Zhenghong’s nephew, but he wasn’t his son. Why did Zhou Zhenghong have to buy a house and car for his nephew?

Zhou Zhenghong was surprised by his older brother’s shamelessness again.
