“Really?” Gu Ning apparently didn’t believe her. “Why do you even ask me why I’m here? This is my classroom. If I’m not here, where should I be?” Gu Ning continued.

“I-I, I…” Shao Feifei panicked. She didn’t know how to deal with it.

Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya knew Shao Feifei so well. They immediately understood Shao Feifei must had done something to Gu Ning secretly. She probably assumed she had succeeded. That was the reason why she was so happy today.

But Gu Ning appeared as usual, Shao Feifei was surprised and felt guilty.

Shao Feifei didn’t dare to tell the truth. Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya both shut their mouth too. They were also unwilling to add fuel on the flames, in case Shao Feifei would blame them for that later.

Luckily, the bell rang, and it was time for the morning reading class. The head teacher was here as well. Gu Ning let go of Shao Feifei, then went to her seat.

There would be ample time ahead.

Besides, Gu Ning had no intention to reveal the truth. She preferred to torture her opponents without others’ knowing.

Seeing Gu Ning walk away, Shao Feifei breathed out.

She was annoyed to herself for feeling guilty. What would Gu Ning do even if she found out the truth? Gu Ning was merely a poor girl. She couldn’t do anything to hurt Shao Feifei.

After that, Shao Feifei didn’t feel guilty at all. She glared at Gu Ning with intense hatred.

She believed Gu Ning had only been lucky to have escaped away yesterday. It wasn’t the end of the story. Shao Feifei started to plan her next step.

Gu Ning actually received the unkind look from Shao Feifei, but she ignored it.

The headteacher left after a while.

Although Gu Ning’s eyes were on her book, she was busy thinking something about herself in her mind—How to build her power?

It wasn’t as easy as making money.

Without power and sources, you could never build your empire only with money.

Property and sources were an important step.

But before that, Gu Ning needed to have enough money.

For Gu Ning, stone gambling was the quickest way to make money. She had the Jade Eyes, and she would never lose. However, she wasn’t able to gamble on stones anywhere she wanted. It wasn’t convenient.

The main origins of stones were Burma and Province Y. They were both far away from City F.

There was no direct plane from City F to Province Y. One needed to spend around two hours on waiting before transferring to the destination. Thus it took around seven hours from City F to Province Y. Gu Ning only had her weekends. She didn’t have enough time for that.

Moreover, she was a senior in a high school, and under great academic pressure. It wasn’t easy to ask days off and her mother Gu Man wouldn’t allow her to leave school as well.

Thus, Gu Ning had to choose a nearest city with stone gambling.

Which city allowed stone gambling? Gu Ning had no idea. She needed to look up on the Internet. Unfortunately, her phone was too old to surf the Internet.

Right at that moment, Gu Ning realized the importance of a great phone.

As for her start-up fund, she only had 110 thousand yuans, which was barely enough. She couldn’t buy a single stone with all her savings.

Therefore, Gu Ning intended to sell the jade that the man had given her yesterday. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She had already absorbed the power of the jade anyway. It was useless to her now. Once she was rich, she could buy whatever jade she wanted.

Though the power had been absorbed, the jade was still of excellent quality.

Gu Ning was a doer, instead of a talker. When they had a break at noon, Gu Ning left her school immediately after she had told Yu Mixi that they would continue the class in the afternoon.

The minute Gu Ning walked out the gate of her school, she went on a taxi to the downtown.

The downtown wasn’t far away. Gu Ning arrived there after 20 minutes.

She went straight to a phone shop, and bought a homemade mobile phone with the best equipment. If she had had a good reason, she would have bought another one for Gu Man.

Gu Ning left the phone shop, going inside a plaza. She found herself a well-decorated restaurant to have meal first. Then she surfed the Internet about the knowledge of jade.

Since she was going to be in touch with the jade, it was better to know it well first.

For now, Gu Ning wanted to find out the quality and value of the jade in her hand. She was going to sell it at a good price.

In Gu Ning’s mind, a jewelry store was the only way to sell her jade. In that way, the jade could be sold out at a good price.

And the jewelry store was always willing to buy a jade of high quality.

Gu Ning knew she probably wouldn’t get the highest price in the market, but the price wouldn’t be low.

But she was totally shocked when she found out the background of this jade.

Gu Ning knew this jade was of excellent quality, but didn’t expect it to be that valuable. It was the top King’s Green.

The King’s Green was rare in the market, and was super expensive.

A ring made of the King’s Green was worth of around a million yuan in the market. Its price could even be higher at auction.

The King’s Green in Gu Ning’s hand was as big as a quail’s egg. It weighed 10 times heavier than a ring.

That was to say, if it was sold according to its weight, it was worth two million yuan in the market, at least.

At auction, it could be sold out at the price of several million.

The price could be higher though.

Thinking of the price of the King’s Green, Gu Ning breathed in a long breath. The man had been so generous to give her such a valuable jade.

The rich was really different from the poor.

What Gu Ning didn’t know was the King’s Green meant nothing to Leng Shaoting. In Leng Shaoting’s eyes, it was just a stone. He would have already thrown it away if the jade hadn’t been so valuable.

He had carried the King’s Green with him, only because his good friend wanted it. He had planned to send it to his friend as a gift, but had ended up giving it to Gu Ning.

But Gu Ning was a poor senior student now. She had no idea how to sell the jade at auction.

Besides, there was no auction in City F.
