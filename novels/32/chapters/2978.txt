2979 Talk About the Condition

It wasn’t the first time that Wang Yiming had said this to them, they just refused to listen before. However, they had already been convinced by Leng Xiaoyao’s speech.

“You all, will you do your best for the National College Entrance Examination?” Wang Yiming asked.

“We will!” They answered loudly.

“Great, then I’ll leave the evening class to Leng Xiaoyao. If she’s willing to explain questions to you, she can use the evening class, but we can’t force her. After all, it’ll take a lot of energy. So, it’s totally up to her,” Wang Yiming said. He hoped that Leng Xiaoyao could help the students with their reviewing, but he wouldn’t force her.

Hearing that, everyone turned to look at Leng Xiaoyao with anticipation.

Leng Xiaoyao replied. “If you all agree, I can do that.”

There was no conflict between her and the other students in Class 8. Although they sometimes bad-mouthed her behind her back, they never had any conflict with her face to face. Therefore, they didn’t mind if she were willing to teach them. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t a saint, but she was willing to share with others, so it wasn’t a bad thing to be needed.

“Great, now let’s applaud Leng Xiaoyao to thank her!” Wang Yiming was very happy and led the applause.

The next moment, there was thunderous applause.

After that, Wang Yiming let Leng Xiaoyao take the time of the evening class, so she continued to explain the questions for the other students.

Wang Yiming felt that Leng Xiaoyao was like a shining, rising star. She was too captivating to ignore!

In fact, he still couldn’t digest the fact that Leng Xiaoyao suddenly became so excellent, but it wasn’t important. Most importantly, Leng Xiaoyao changed and became an excellent student, and now she was leading their class to make progress.

Wang Yiming didn’t expect all of them to enroll in a university, because the National College Entrance Examination was only two months away, but it wouldn’t be difficult for more students to get accepted.

Suddenly, Wang Yiming wondered whether Leng Xiaoyao could become the top scorer of this year.

If the top scorer was from their class, he would be so proud and the best class in their school might feel embarrassed!

Upon thinking of that, Wang Yiming was excited, but it was just his idea. Although Leng Xiaoyao had become an excellent student now, it would be very hard for her to get the highest score in the exam.

After all, the National College Entrance Examination was a national exam, and excellent students could also perform badly due to anxiety.

Some good students, on the other hand, might perform incredibly well in the exam and get a high score.

He knew little about Leng Xiaoyao, so he wasn’t sure what kind of student she was.

When Leng Xiaoyao explained the questions, she didn’t just focus on teaching. She would also change the topic and tell some jokes to keep her classmates interested.

Leng Xiaoyao had completely changed her classmates’ opinion about her. Everyone thought she was totally different and somehow felt as if she was a new teacher.

The class was over at 9 pm, but the students were unwilling to leave.

“Leng Xiaoyao, thank you so much for your effort.” Wang Yiming thanked Leng Xiaoyao. She encouraged so many students, so he was very grateful to her.

“Mr. Wang, there is no need to thank me. I wanted to do it after all. If I was not willing to do it, no one could force me, but there is a condition I need to set. I hope you can agree,” Leng Xiaoyao said. Actually, she didn’t think of a condition until she remembered something.

“Oh, what is it?” Wang Yiming asked. He didn’t feel mad that Leng Xiaoyao wanted to lay down a condition.

Instead, he felt better when Leng Xiaoyao said that, because he thought it might take too much of Leng Xiaoyao’s time if he asked her to teach the other students.

“Well, you just saw my level. And I might be accepted by the Capital University. I have confidence about that, but I’m not sure about my rank. Before the National College Entrance Examination, I might need to leave the school sometimes. I can’t tell you the details, but I hope that you can allow me to be absent at that time,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“No problem.” Wang Yiming agreed without hesitation. Anyway, Leng Xiaoyao already came to class only when she wanted to. He had never criticized her about that.

Now that Leng Xiaoyao had become an excellent student, it wouldn’t affect her score if she was absent from some classes.

However, Wang Yiming was still surprised when Leng Xiaoyao said that, because he could feel that she was completely different.

Leng Xiaoyao had actually thought about whether she needed to ask for leave, because she usually only came to school when she wanted to attend class. Whether or not she laid down the condition, she would be the same, but she had made a big change, so she decided to ask for their head teacher’s permission first.

“Thank you, Mr. Wang, see you then,” Leng Xiaoyao said, then she walked away.

On her way out, Xiong Manxin and the other girls looked at her curiously.

“What do you want to know?” Leng Xiaoyao asked.

“Boss, you always come to school when you want to attend class. Why did you bother to ask for the teacher’s permission today?” Wu Minmin asked.

“Right.” The other girls chimed in.

“Well, since I’ve decided to change. I need to behave from now on. Do you still want to be absent from class?” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Of course not.” They answered.

Seeing Leng Xiaoyao’s change, they suddenly felt like changing too. If Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to be rude, they would do the same. If Leng Xiaoyao decided to study hard, they would do it as well.

They always followed Leng Xiaoyao, so they were easily affected by her.

“What I want you to learn isn’t just the knowledge in textbooks. That’s not the most important thing. The most important thing is that we must have manners,” Leng Xiaoyao said.
