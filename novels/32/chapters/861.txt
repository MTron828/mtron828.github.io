864 A Vase Covered in Yin

They already got those valuable objects now, but the problem was how they were going to move them back to their cities.

It was very complicated for people to pass the customs, and it was more difficult to do that with goods. Once those ancient objects were found, they could be caught. After all, it was illegal to move antiques and gold bars without official documents.

Therefore, Li Maosong’s group decided to smuggle them back. However, Shen Zhaoxuan told them that his younger cousin was involved in shipping, and he could help.

Hearing that, Li Maosong’s group was excited.

Given Li Maosong and Shen Zhaoxuan’s close relationship, they believed that Shen Zhaoxuan could handle it well.

“Miss Gu, do you need me to help you?” Shen Zhaoxuan asked out of kindness.

“Thanks, I can take them back myself.” Gu Ning declined.

Gu Ning didn’t tell them more details, and they stopped asking.

...

When they were back in the villa, it was almost 12 pm. Shen Zhaoxuan’s friend, the owner of the house, went to cook seafood.

“Miss Gu, do you have any requests for the taste?” he asked.

“Not at all, please cook it the way you normally do,” Gu Ning said. She wasn’t picky.

“Great!”

Afterwards, everyone started to share what they had got today.

“Miss Gu, we’ll divide these valuable objects into four shares. You’ve done a lot today, so I think you should take two shares. What do you think?” Li Maosong said.

“Right, if it hadn’t been for Miss Gu, we wouldn’t have been able to move them out of the sea,” Shen Zhaoxuan said. They were all willing to let Gu Ning take a larger share.

Gu Ning, however, didn’t agree. “We can divide them into three shares, and each team gets one. Although I’ve done a lot today, you have been very kind and shared the information about the ship with me.”

“Well...” The others felt a little guilty.

“It’s no big deal. Let’s do it that way,” Gu Ning said.

Since Gu Ning said so, they didn’t insist, but they were very grateful to her and admired her more than ever now. However, they didn’t know that Gu Ning had already put several priceless antiques into her telepathic eye space.

Gu Ning’s actions wasn’t right, nor fair, but it wasn’t over the top either.

Like what they had just said, she had contributed a lot to their success today, so it was understandable that she kept the best antiques for herself. In addition, Gu Ning was still very generous, because she didn’t put everything into the telepathic eye space.

She had the ability to do that, and nobody would find out. Nevertheless, Gu Ning hadn’t done it.

In the following minutes, they placed all the gold bars, real antiques, jewelry and other objects on the table before they began to choose.

Gu Ning also picked several objects of high value.

After that, Shen Zhaoxuan’s friend prepared two suitcases for Gu Ning to move her things back to the hotel.

The others would move their shares to the ship with the yacht. They planned to load the ship in the night, in case they were exposed. They were leaving for their cities as well, so they would buy ship tickets for this ship tomorrow.

A while later, the seafood was done.

...

After lunch, they went back downtown.

Shen Zhaoxuan’s friend drove Gu Ning’s group back to the hotel, while Li Maosong and his friends would stay in the villa.

Gu Ning didn’t move the two suitcases to her room, but put them into the car He Siyin left for them. She told Gao Yi and Qiao Ya to have a rest in the hotel, then she walked out.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya understood that Gu Ning didn’t want them to follow her, so they went back to their room.

Once Gu Ning got back to the car, she put all the ancient objects into the telepathic eye space. Afterwards, she drove around the center of HK.

On the way, she noticed the three words for the antique street on a sign by chance. She got interested at once, and turned there.

Although she had a large amount of real antiques now, the more she had, the better.

There was a big parking lot outside of the antique street. Gu Ning parked the car, then got out and walked inside.

The antique street in HK looked very ancient.

HK was the hub of commerce and finance, so there were countless objects along the sides of the antique street here. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

As usual, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes the second she entered the antique street.

“This is covered in Yin! You can’t buy it. You could be killed by this thing!”

All of a sudden, Gu Ning heard a loud male voice filled with anxiety.

A nearby antique store was surrounded by many people, and an old man around 60 years old was standing in the middle. He was pulling a middle-aged man trying to stop him. Besides, the old man’s forehead was a little dark, which meant he was affected by Yin.

The old man also mentioned an antique which was covered in Yin.

Gu Ning looked over and saw a blue and white porcelain vase placed on the counter. It was as big as a mineral-water bottle, and it was real, but it was indeed covered in Yin.
