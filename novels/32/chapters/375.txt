Chapter 376 Leng Shaoting’s and Situ Ye’s Gift

Without much effort, Gu Ning got screenshots of Wu Lianqin’s photos and introduction. She sent those materials to Gao Yi and told him to investigate Wu Lianqin’s background to see whether he had done anything illegal. As a professional killer, it was also necessary to be an excellent detective. It wasn’t difficult for Gao Yi to investigate Wu Lianqin.

Leng Shaoting booked the room and told Gu Ning its number. He understood that Gu Ning wanted to keep it private, and he respected her. When they were both in the room, Leng Shaoting couldn’t wait to undress Gu Ning and spend the whole night with her in the bed for a second longer.

The three policemen took the criminal back to the police station and went to arrest Wu Lianqin’s secretary without delay. They also informed Wu Lianqin that he needed to come to the police station as soon as possible.

Since their scheme was already exposed, Wu Lianqin’s secretary had to admit it, but he didn’t mention Wu Lianqin at all. He only claimed that he disliked An Guangyao and tried to kill him. The secretary protected Wu Lianqin because he knew that Wu Lianqin would hurt his family if he told the truth.

Wu Lianqin was furious when he found out that their scheme had been exposed, but he wouldn’t admit that he was involved since his secretary was willing to be the scapegoat. Because Wu Lianqin denied it, the police couldn’t arrest him. And his secretary was made a scapegoat for what happened.

When An Guangyao heard the result, he wasn’t surprised, nor was he mad, because Gu Ning had told him that she had another plan to teach Wu Lianqin a lesson.

When it was almost 11 pm, Gu Ning called Gu Man. She made up an excuse that Chu Peihan wasn’t in a good mood, so she wouldn’t be coming home tonight. Gu Man didn’t doubt it and agreed.

The next day, Gu Ning still stayed with Leng Shaoting. It was raining outside, so Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting ate at the hotel.

Meanwhile, Wu Lianqin’s secretary and the criminal were sentenced to three years in jail for attempted murder.

In City G, Liu Shikun and the others were also sentenced by the court, but the New Year festival was tomorrow, so Yan Zhenglin told Gu Ning that the Hongyun Group’s properties would be put up for auction after the festival. Gu Ning wasn’t in a hurry, so she agreed.

Leng Shaoting didn’t leave the hotel and Gu Ning until it was 5 pm.

Before he left, Leng Shaoting took out a box from the trunk of his car. He said that it was a New Year gift for Gu Man, and that there were two pieces of ginseng inside. They seemed old and had to be expensive. Other than ginseng, there were also many other precious herbal medicines in the box. Since it was a gift from Leng Shaoting, Gu Ning accepted it with pleasure.

After that, Gu Ning sent Leng Shaoting to the airport.

Leng Shaoting didn’t want to bother Gu Ning, but he wanted to seize every second that he could be with her, so he let Gu Ning send him to the airport.

When Leng Shaoting had left for a short while, Gu Ning received Gao Yi’s call; he had gotten evidence of all of Wu Lianqin’s criminal activities. Wu Lianqin was a very bold businessman, and he was too proud to destroy the proof. Thus it was very easy to investigate his criminal history.

Corrupt Wu Lianqin, had illegally taken over forty million yuan which was the funds of a construction project, putting it into his own pocket, and had even used shoddy construction materials. He had also schemed against his competitors in business and deliberately caused a car accident.

Except for his corruption, the rest was all done by others who worked for him, so there was no direct proof to prove that he was guilty. However, corruption alone was enough to sentence him to prison.

With the evidence in her hands, Gu Ning told K to find the email address of the chairman of the Tianhua Group and send all of Wu Lianqin’s dirty secrets to the chairman. Tianhua Group was the parent company of Tianhua Real Estate in which Wu Lianqin was the executive president.

Gu Ning didn’t send the email in person, because she didn’t want to be involved. Her aim was to unseat Wu Lianqin after all.

The chairman of the Tianhua Group was furious when he read the email, and immediately demanded that people look into it.

Gu Ning shared her dinner with Gao Yi and Qiao Ya. She wasn’t going home yet, so she put Leng Shaoting’s gift into her telepathic eye space. During the meal, Gu Ning received Chu Xuanfeng’s call. Chu Xuanfeng asked where she was and wanted to meet her in person. Gu Ning had a sense that it had something to do with Situ Ye, but either way, she agreed to meet with him.

Chu Xuanfeng came alone, but showed up with a box of gifts. He told Gu Ning that it was Situ Ye who asked him to give her the New Year gift.

Gu Ning was surprised, but it was also predictable. She didn’t accept it immediately, but instead used her Jade Eyes to see what was inside. If they were too expensive, she would decline.

Without doubt, the objects inside were truly expensive, like two bottles of 85′ Medusa from the Conti Winery in Rome, which were worth at least a hundred and ninety thousand yuan! And there were many precious herbal medicines too. Gu Ning hesitated because it was Situ Ye, not Leng Shaoting, who sent such expensive gifts to her.

“I don’t think that I should take them,” Gu Ning said. Although they were nothing to Situ Ye, they were really very expensive.

Knowing what was on Gu Ning’s mind, Chu Xuanfeng almost begged, “Please accept it! Otherwise I’ll be in big trouble.”

Gu Ning didn’t know whether Chu Xuanfeng was being serious, but she didn’t want him to get in trouble. After a short time of hesitating, Gu Ning accepted the box of gifts in the end. Anyway, she had received much more expensive gift than that from Situ Ye before!

“Alright, I’ll call him to thank him for the gifts,” Gu Ning sighed, and took the box.

Seeing that Gu Ning took the box, Chu Xuanfeng was relieved. Actually, he wasn’t lying. If he failed to get Gu Ning to accept the gifts from his boss, he wouldn’t have a peaceful New Year festival this year.

Gu Ning called Situ Ye the moment Chu Xuanfeng was gone.

“Hi, how are you doing?” Situ Ye said once he answered the call. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Great. And I just received your New Year gift; they’re too expensive,” Gu Ning said.

“Why don’t you buy me a meal when you’re in City G to thank me?” Situ Ye said. Apparently, he was creating chances to meet Gu Ning alone.

“No problem,” Gu Ning said. Since she had already accepted Situ Ye’s gifts, it was reasonable that she invited him to dine together.

They said “Happy New Year” to each other before hanging up.
