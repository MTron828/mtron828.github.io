Chapter 1401: Feng Qile’s Injured

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Can we be friends? I don’t have many friends and I always feel bored,” Baili Zongxue asked Gu Ning and looked pitiful.

Even though Gu Ning was aware that she was approaching her on purpose, it was hard for her to hate her. In addition, Gu Ning could feel her sincerity. Maybe she would really want to become friends with her when she got to know more about her.

“Sure!” Gu Ning was willing to make friends with Baili Zongxue.

“Wonderful! Can we exchange phone numbers? Can I add you as my WeChat friend?” Baili Zongxue asked with excitement.

“No problem.” Gu Ning agreed.

After that, they went for a run together.

When they finished exercising, Baili Zongxue invited Gu Ning to share breakfast, but Gu Ning declined so she didn’t insist.

Once Gu Ning was gone, the active and adorable Baili Zongxue disappeared and she returned to being calm and cool. “It seems alright.”

“No matter what, you should be careful,” Baili Zongyang said.

“I understand.” Baili Zongxue nodded.

...

Gu Ning went back to her home later. She took a shower and changed her clothes before she enjoyed her breakfast. After resting for a while, she left for her company.

On her way, Gu Ning thought about what she should do in the following days. The result of the National College Entrance Examination would be out in four days, so she needed to go back to City F.

Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin’s wedding was only a week away, and she also needed to send them a special wedding gift then. However, she wouldn’t show up as Gu Ning, but as Tang Aining.

Both the Tang Aining from the previous incarnation and the Tang Aining in this incarnation had a grudge against them, so their wedding would definitely be unforgettable.

Gu Ning had the idea to secretly let Ji Yijing find out Tang Bingsen’s illegitimate son and make Ji Yijing deal with the illegitimate son herself. Since Ji Yijing was able to hurt her mother so badly in the previous incarnation, it wouldn’t be a problem for Ji Yijing to do that again. However, Gu Ning thought that it was an evil idea, because Tang Bingsen’s illegitimate son was innocent. If Ji Yijing took action, the illegitimate son would definitely be killed.

Gu Ning would feel guilty if the innocent boy died because of her, so she gave up this idea.

Anyway, Feng Qile was Tang Bingsen’s son, and he was the first heir of his business. Gu Ning was about to deal with Tang Yaxin to make Tang Yaxin lose the qualification of an heir. Feng Qile was her next target. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

If Tang Bingsen was in trouble, Feng Qile would replace him, which would be an obstacle on Tang Qingyang’s way to power in the Tang Organization. Tang Qingyang was a major shareholder and was also a member of the Tang family, so he would take over the Tang Organization as long as Tang Bingsen’s family wasn’t able to run the company.

Therefore, Gu Ning planned to help get Feng Qile out of the fierce competition in the Tang family and cut his relationship with it.

Tang Qingyang needed all the other major shareholders’ support in order to take over the Tang Organization, so Gu Ning decided to handle it before she dealt with Tang Bingsen.

Since Tang Qingyang was going to take over the Tang Organization, they had to control and minimize the damage, but there were going to be unavoidable damages. The Tang Organization would be in turmoil, because it would have a new leader.

While Gu Ning was deep in thought, she was scared when the car came to an abrupt halt.

“What’s wrong?” Gu Ning asked at once.

“There is a car crash ahead, boss,” Gao Yi said. The car accident was still a distance from them, so they were fine.

Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to look forward without delay. She saw that the front of one car was seriously damaged, and the car accident seemed very horrible.

Coincidentally, right as Gu Ning was thinking about Tang Bingsen’s illegitimate son, his illegitimate son was caught in this car accident. He seemed to be severely injured.

The driver of the car was Tang Bingsen’s mistress, Feng Lin, and Feng Qile sat in the front passenger’s seat. Their car hit the back of a big truck ahead of them, and the windshield was broken into pieces, which stuck into his head. Therefore, Feng Qile’s head was bleeding and he was unconscious now.

After seeing that, Gu Ning sat still in her car. She had no intention to get involved in this. This was the first time that Gu Ning had stayed indifferent.

It wasn’t her fault that she was cold-blooded. Although she was kind and helpful, she wouldn’t help just anyone. Feng Qile was Tang Bingsen’s illegitimate son after all, and they had a conflict of interest.

She had no plan to hurt him, nor help him when he was injured by accident. Whether he could survive this time depended on him.

Because of the car accident, they were stuck in a traffic jam, and the traffic police immediately came to do their job.

Feng Lin was injured too because she knocked her head against the window, but she was in a much better condition than Feng Qile. She took out her phone in a hurry and called Tang Bingsen.

Tang Bingsen was anxious and went to see them right away. Feng Qile was his only son, and he couldn’t allow him to die!

A while later, an ambulance arrived and sent the injured to the nearby hospital. The capital was a very large city, so the ambulance only came after a long while. The other cars on the road all moved away for the ambulance.

Feng Lin was fine, but Feng Qile was in great danger.

It was about half an hour before Gu Ning could leave, and once she arrived at her office, K came to meet her. He told Gu Ning to log in the game because several other game players wanted to have a competition with her.

Gu Ning was free now, so she agreed.
