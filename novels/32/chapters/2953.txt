2955 End the Engagement

At the Chu family’s house, Chu Zhaofeng, Mrs. Chu, and Chu Jianan were all present.

When Leng Yecheng saw Chu Jianan, he really wanted to give him a punch, but he wasn’t an impulsive man, so he curbed his anger.

Chu Jianan was eager to see them, because he couldn’t wait to end the engagement with Leng Xiaoyao, but when he saw Leng Xiaoyao, he was displeased. He hated Leng Xiaoyao very much and now he hated her even more after she slapped and kicked him.

However, he had to stay polite in order to end the engagement. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Besides, even if he really wanted to use violence, he couldn’t exactly hurt Leng Xiaoyao.

Leng Xiaoyao felt nothing when she saw Chu Jianan. Although she harbored grudges against him, she wouldn’t show it on her face.

The Chu family knew why Leng Changyuan and the others came, but Chu Zhaofeng still asked them after they were seated. “Mr. Leng, is there anything we can help with?”

“Zhaofeng, we’re so close that I think we can be straightforward. I understand Yaoyao is bad-tempered. She does nothing but cause trouble every day. I know your family doesn’t like her, especially Jianan. So, I don’t want to force him to marry her. And Yaoyao has also changed her mind. She wants to end the engagement with Jianan,” Leng Changyuan said directly.

Even though Chu Zhaofeng was already aware of it, he still pretended to be surprised when Leng Changyuan said it aloud. “Mr. Leng, I…”

Chu Zhaofeng wanted to say something, but didn’t know what to say.

“It’s an agreement between us, not them, so it’s normal that Jianan dislikes Yaoyao, but people should have moral standards. Even though Jianan is engaged to Yaoyao, he still has an abnormal relationship with Yuqi. It has humiliated Yaoyao and the Leng family. I understand it takes two to tango, so I’m also ashamed of such a shameless granddaughter who has an affair with her cousin’s fiancé. As a result, even though Yaoyao is ending the engagement with Jianan, Yuqi can’t be with Jianan,” Leng Changyuan said.

“Why?”

Chu Jianan was anxious once he heard that.

If Leng Xiaoyao ended the engagement with him, why couldn’t he be together with Leng Yuqi?

“Everyone in the high society of City Chang is aware of the Leng family’s engagement with the Chu family. If Yuqi gets together with you after Yaoyao ends the engagement with you, people will know that Yaoyao did that because you betrayed her. If you’re together with another girl, I won’t interfere, but not Yuqi. We don’t want to be humiliated,” Leng Changyuan explained.

Even though Leng Xiaoyao ended her engagement with Chu Jianan, Leng Changyuan still wouldn’t allow Leng Yuqi to get together with Chu Jianan.

However, he didn’t do that for the Leng family’s pride, but simply to pay them back for Leng Xiaoyao.

Leng Xiaoyao actually didn’t care about whether Chu Jianan got together with Leng Yuqi after their engagement ended, but she said nothing since Leng Changyuan was so protective of her.

Her grandfather could deal with it as he wanted, while she only wanted to end the engagement with Chu Jianan.

“It’s not that serious!” Chu Jianan exclained. Precisely because he didn’t think it was so serious, he thought that Leng Changyuan was doing it on purpose.

However, Chu Zhaofeng agreed with Leng Changyuan, so he started to think it was a bad idea.

“You’re not experienced. Don’t you know that words can kill? Do you know what people of high status are most afraid of? We don’t want our reputation to be damaged, because it can affect our future or business. What’s happening between you and Yuqi is extremely amoral,” Leng Changyuan said.

Even though Leng Changyuan made it very clear, Chu Jianan still didn’t think it was a big deal. After all, he was very young.

“Grandpa Leng, it won’t be as serious as you just described. You’re too protective of Leng Xiaoyao, so you don’t want Yuqi to be together with me, right?” Chu Jianan angrily questioned Leng Changyuan, but that was the truth.

“Jianan, how could you talk to Grandpa Leng like that? Apologize, now!” Chu Zhaofeng snapped.

“Dad, I…” Chu Jianan was reluctant to do that.

“Well, Yaoyao is my granddaughter. Shouldn’t I protect her when she’s been taken advantage of?” Leng Changyuan asked. He denied that he was too protective of Leng Xiaoyao.

“Yaoyao is quick-tempered, but she wouldn’t have injured you if you hadn’t betrayed her.” Leng Changyuan stated.

This time, Chu Jianan didn’t know what to say.

He was unwilling to accept it, because he felt he was innocent and his family didn’t ask for his permission when they agreed to the engagement with Leng Xiaoyao. Was he wrong?

He wasn’t wrong, but that didn’t mean he could cheat on Leng Xiaoyao.

“You pushed Yaoyao down on the ground, and she passed out. Why didn’t you call the hospital? Did you want her to die?” Leng Yecheng questioned at this point. He coldly stared at Chu Jianan, putting pressure on him.

“What? You pushed Xiaoyao causing her to pass out?”

Hearing that, Chu Zhaofeng was surprised, because he didn’t know that it was Chu Jianan who attacked Leng Xiaoyao first.

Mrs. Chu was also extremely surprised, because she didn’t know that either.

However, she wouldn’t blame Chu Jianan, because she believed that Leng Xiaoyao deserved it.

She didn’t have any sympathy for Leng Xiaoyao, and completely sided with Chu Jianan, but she had the same idea as Chu Zhaofeng after hearing Leng Changyuan’s words. If Chu Jianan really married Leng Yuqi after ending the engagement with Leng Xiaoyao, it would damage the Chu family’s reputation and business.

Although she liked Leng Yuqi, she cared more about the Chu family’s reputation.

After all, Leng Yuqi was just an outsider.
