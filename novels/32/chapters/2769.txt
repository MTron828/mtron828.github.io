Chapter 2770: Feel out Leng Shaoming Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Nourished by the magical power, Zhan Zhiyin’s internal injuries were quickly healed.

“Oh, where is the truck driver?” asked Jiang Shuyuan.

“He’s already gone. He has a good attitude and agreed to pay the compensation, but…” said Leng Shaoming.

“But what?” Master Leng asked with a frown. He had a feeling that it wasn’t so simple.

“But I have suspicions that this car accident might not really be an accident. It could be a scheme. Although I don’t have evidence, the big truck didn’t turn until it was close to my car. The truck driver explained that his mind went blank for a second, then he hit my car. It’s not enough to prove that it’s a scheme, but I saw panic in his expression. I need to conduct a further investigation about that. So for now we should finish the formalities with the police. After we have more evidence, we can deal with the case again,” said Leng Shaoming. Only his family was in the room, so there was no need for him to keep it a secret.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Leng Shaoming spoke about his suspicions with his family, because the mastermind might not just target him. His whole family might be targeted.

Therefore, he needed to tell them to be more careful.

“How dare he scheme against Shaoming! If we can catch the mastermind, we’ll definitely make him pay a heavy price,” said Jiang Shuyuan with strong hatred. She couldn’t wait to tear the mastermind to pieces.

“Well, since he dares to scheme against us, we should teach him a lesson.” Master Leng was also furious.

“I already sent out people to conduct an investigation. Once there is a result, we’ll definitely take it seriously,” said Leng Yuanqian. His son could have been killed, so it was impossible for him not to be mad. In fact, he was angrier than anyone else.

They had to deal with it according to the law, otherwise he would kill the person by a thousand cuts.

Whether or not only Leng Shaoming or the whole Leng family was targeted, all of them were very mad about the accident.

…

After the truck driver left the police station, he made a call and said that he had failed his task and that Leng Shaoming was only slightly injured.

The person on the other side of the phone was very disappointed, but he didn’t blame the truck driver. After all, Leng Shaoming’s car was already knocked into the river. Even if he wasn’t killed, he should have been seriously injured, but he survived and was fine.

It was very strange, but he had to admit that Leng Shaoming had good luck.

…

After taking Gu Ning’s power crystal, Leng Shaoming quickly felt much better. Zhan Zhiyin also went back to normal, but they didn’t plan to leave the hospital yet.

A while later, Leng Shaoming’s leader and colleagues learned about the car accident, and came to see him together.

When they walked into Leng Shaoming’s ward, they were extremely nervous to face the Leng family. After all, their status was barely comparable to the Leng family’s, so they couldn’t help but stand in awe of them.

That afternoon, the Leng family left. Because Leng Shaoming was fine now, they didn’t need to stay and take care of him.

In fact, it wasn’t suitable for them to stay there right now!

It was time and space for Leng Shaoting and Zhan Zhiyin to take a step in their romantic relationship.

They had been through a terrible accident together, so they had different feelings for each other now. They were much closer than before.

When the Leng family left they thanked Zhan Zhiyin again, which embarrassed her.

After they left, only Leng Shaoming and Zhan Zhiyin were in the room.

Strangely, the atmosphere became a little embarrassing.

“I’m sorry for making you stay in the hospital with me.” Leng Shaoming apologized. They didn’t leave the hospital, not because of their physical condition, but because of something else.

“It’s fine,” said Zhan Zhiyin. She came here in order to see Leng Shaoming. As long as she was with him she didn’t care what they were doing and where they were.

However, she was growingly anxious as she became closer and closer to Leng Shaoming. She always hesitated to tell him about her real identity.

She wanted to be honest with him, but she was afraid that he might disdain and leave her since there was no love between them.

However, if she didn’t tell him earlier, it would hurt him deeply after he fell in love with her. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Therefore, Zhan Zhiyin hesitated to make a decision.

Seeing that Zhan Zhiyin was unhappy, Leng Shaoming asked, “What’s wrong? Why do you look worried?”

Right after asking that question, Leng Shaoming realized he shouldn’t have done that. He was clearly aware that Zhan Zhiyin wanted to be closer to him, so he shouldn’t embarrass her like that.

“Um, I’m just thinking about something,” said Zhan Zhiyin.

“What is it? Can you talk to me about it?” asked Leng Shaoming. He was prepared to confess his affection to Zhan Zhiyin anytime, but before that, he was slightly nervous, so he decided to chat with Zhan Zhiyin for a while.

“It’s not something serious. I just read a romantic story about a human and a monster yesterday. I’m wondering if it’s acceptable for a man to be in love with a female monster,” said Zhan Zhiyin. She decided to feel out Leng Shaoming first.

“I don’t know. But I think most men wouldn’t be able to accept that. After all, monsters are really scary. It’s just a story,” said Leng Shaoming.

“How about you? If you didn’t know the girl is a monster and fell in love with her, would you accept her if she loves you back?” Zhan Zhiyin joked with Leng Shaoming, but she was actually very anxious. Although it wasn’t a formal confession, it was important for her to know his real feelings.

“I don’t know. It won’t happen in real life after all. And I’ve never encountered such a thing before. I can’t tell what I’d do. If monsters really exist in this world, honestly I’d be scared when I see them,” said Leng Shaoming. He also joked about it, but that was his real thoughts.

Even though Zhan Zhiyin understood that it was very normal for Leng Shaoming to have that idea, she still felt very upset.

“Right.” Zhan Zhiyin forced a smile as a reply.
