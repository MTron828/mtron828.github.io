Chapter 1440: I’m Super Rich Myself

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Enough!” Gu Ning lost patience and coldly looked at Hu Jiarong. “Ms. Hu, I think there is a misunderstanding. My mother has indeed married into a super-rich family, but the man has never married before nor has he had any other kids. I can make money myself, and I don’t need to inherit his wealth.”

Hu Jiarong was scared when Gu Ning snapped at her. Gu Ning’s cold look also terrified her.

She was surprised when she heard that it was Gu Man’s husband’s first marriage and that he didn’t have other kids. However, she didn’t believe that Gu Ning would refuse to inherit a lot of wealth.

Although Gu Ning was the top scorer this year, it didn’t mean she could be successful in the future.

Seeing Hu Jiarong’s reaction, Gu Ning knew what she was thinking.

She didn’t mind it, and continued, “My mother and my father love each other deeply, and it’s the truth that my father is far richer than my mother, but my mother owns two beauty salons as well.”

“They are worth over fifty million yuan, and I also have over five billion yuan in wealth. My mother is rich, while I’m super-rich. I think we can live a good life on our own.”

Hearing that, Hu Jiarong was shocked again. She couldn’t believe that Gu Man owned two beauty salons with over fifty million yuan in assets. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

And Gu Ning also had at least five billion yuan in wealth!

“Wow, five billion yuan!” Hu Jiarong’s daughter rounded her eyes in shock. In fact, Hu Jiarong’s daughter had a good impression of Gu Ning, and she knew her mother very well.

“By the way, my mother married my biological father, and he treats me very well!” Gu Ning added.

It was another piece of shocking news in Hu Jiarong’s ears. If Gu Man married Gu Ning’s biological father, the man must be Ning. However, she remembered that he had died in a car accident. Obviously, there were many things that she didn’t know after Gu Man quit school.

Hu Jiarong was full of jealousy now. She was jealous of Gu Man because she was able to marry a handsome man from a super-rich family.

“So, Ms. Hu, please mind your own life, and don’t be so unkind towards my mother. You’re not comparable to my mother,” Gu Ning said, and left with Gu Man.

Gu Man was also mad, so she followed Gu Ning outside. She had thought that she met a good old schoolmate today, but she was wrong. Hu Jiarong simply wanted to laugh at her.

Hu Jiarong didn’t completely digest what Gu Ning told her until both Gu Man and Gu Ning were gone for a long while. It was hard for her to accept the fact that Gu Man lived a much better life than her. She felt angry and clenched her teeth.

“Mom, please don’t do that anymore. You’ve embarrassed yourself many times! Can’t you learn a lesson from it?” Hu Jiarong’s daughter complained.

“You’re just a kid! Eat your cakes and shut your mouth!” Hu Jiarong glared at her daughter.

Hu Jiarong’s daughter wasn’t afraid of her, and didn’t bother to argue with her. Hu Jiarong’s husband loved their daughter very much, so Hu Jiarong didn’t dare to shout at their daughter in case her husband became angry at her.

Hu Jiarong’s daughter was very smart, and she knew that she could turn to her father for help if her mother treated her badly. Hu Jiarong thought that it was unfair, but she couldn’t do anything about it.

...

Gu Man sighed when Hu Jiarong was out of her sight. “We were good friends back then, but she’s totally different now.”

In fact, she didn’t feel very sad, because they hadn’t seen each other in years after all, but she was surprised by other people’s jealousy.

Gu Ning comforted her. “Mom, you don’t need to think too much about it. There are many people who judge everyone and everything with money. They’re ridiculous and stupid.”

“I understand.” Gu Man nodded.

Afterwards, they kept on shopping.

Whenever Gu Man saw babies’ clothing, she couldn’t move her eyes away from them.

They shopped for a while, then went to Kamei Beauty Salon. Gu Man hadn’t been there in days, so she wanted to go see it today since she was in the shopping mall now.

Kamei Beauty Salon was crowded every day, and it wasn’t a secret that it was owned by Tang Yunfan’s wife.

Even though some people were jealous of it, no one dared to cause it any trouble. And many beauty salons also replaced their old skin care products with Kouzi because of its great effects.
