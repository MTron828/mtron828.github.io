Chapter 1266: Jealous of Gu Ning

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

All the parents outside the school were shocked. They couldn’t believe that Gu Ning was the girl who had won the champion of this year’s national math competition.

In that case, Gu Ning could really have finished her paper properly before she came out.

However, some parents still believed that Gu Ning might have cheated in the test. After all, it was very hard for them to accept the fact that Gu Ning was unusually outstanding and smart among the high school students.

“Well, I can’t jump to conclusions, but I’m confident that I can get into my dream university,” Gu Ning said. She looked very confident, but not arrogant.

“Which university is your dream university?” the reporter asked.

“The Capital University,” Gu Ning said.

The Capital University was a famous and prestigious university in the country, and it had a very selective admissions policy.

Gu Ning was the champion of this year’s national math competition, so it was highly possible for her to be accepted by the Capital University.

Many parents were jealous of Gu Ning now. They all hoped that their children could get into the best universities in the country, which would become the pride of their families. Nevertheless, their children were barely comparable to Gu Ning.

They felt uncomfortable that Gu Ning was far more outstanding than their kids.

As a result, a middle-aged woman opened her mouth and said in an acidic tone, “Being confident is a good thing, but don’t brag about your ability in case you fail.”

The female reporter turned to the middle-aged woman at once.

“I just had an interview with you, and you were very confident about your kid’s performance. You said that your kid can easily get into a good university. Why do you think other students are bragging when they have confidence in themselves?” This female reporter sided herself with Gu Ning.

She had heard a lot about Gu Ning’s achievements before, so she believed that Gu Ning wasn’t bragging.

Actually, she was a fan of Gu Ning’s so she was willing to defend Gu Ning.

“You...” The middle-aged woman was struck dumb for a second.

Some parents held the same idea as her, but they didn’t dare to say anything right now after hearing the female reporter’s question.

All the students who were writing the exam hoped that they could do their best to get into a good university. Gu Ning was one of them, and it was understandable that she had confidence in herself.

“Gu Ning, I believe that you can successfully get into the Capital University, and I also believe that your career will only be better and better in the future,” the female reporter said to Gu Ning afterwards.

Those parents, however, were confused. In their eyes, Gu Ning was merely a student, and it was impossible for her to have a career at such an early age.

Although they were confused, they felt embarrassed to ask more questions about Gu Ning.

“Thanks.” Gu Ning smiled and left with her family.

“Ningning, how was the test?” Gu Man asked Gu Ning later.

“It’s easy and I’ve answered all of the questions,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, Gu Ning’s family felt happy for her.

The second test would be held at 3 pm, but it was only 10 am now, so they went home to have lunch first.

After the first day of tests, Gu Ning called Master Leng and told him her feelings.

Master Leng laughed with satisfaction when Gu Ning told him that she was confident in getting high scores. Without hesitation, Master Leng called Jiang Zhongyu and Master Xu to show off.

Master Xu and Jiang Zhongyu also felt happy for Gu Ning, but they were envious of Master Leng. They wished that Gu Ning could be their grand daughter-in-law. Thinking of that, they blamed their grandsons for it.

Jiang Ruiqin and Xu Jinchen felt aggrieved, because they didn’t think that it was their fault that Gu Ning didn’t become their girlfriend.

Xu Jinchen didn’t care much about it, but Jiang Ruiqin felt a little sad. He actually had the idea to chase Gu Ning before, but Gu Ning already had Leng Shaoting as her boyfriend back then.

Master Leng then told his family the good news that Gu Ning was confident to get into the Capital University.

Some members of the Leng family felt happy for Gu Ning, while some didn’t. Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia never liked Gu Ning so they snorted with disdain. In their eyes, Gu Ning was from a poor family. Even though she was a billionaire now, she was nouveau riche. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

No matter what Gu Ning had achieved, they still had the idea to cause Gu Ning trouble.

...

After two days, the National College Entrance Examination was over, and Gu Ning handed her paper in much earlier than the other students as always.

Other students were greatly surprised the first time, but they gradually accepted it.

Tang Yunfan, Tang Haifeng, Gu Man and Leng Shaoting stayed by Gu Ning’s side during these two days.

At the same time, there were many pieces of news about Gu Ning on TV.
