3309 Win First Place

After a while, the scores of other students came out.

There were students who got 95 and 96 points, but none of them reached 97 points.

The final rankings were: Leng Xiaoyao in first place, the male student who was first in the first two rounds in second place, and the student who came from fifth place in third place.

Since they were all top students, even though there was a difference in ranking in the first two rounds, their overall scores only differed by a few points. There were also many students with the same score.

After the rankings were announced, Zhou Jing became even more excited. Leng Xiaoyao was also very happy.

She didn’t care much about fame and fortune, but since she had promised to participate, she naturally wanted to get a good ranking.

The awards ceremony was presented by the principal of the Capital University.

There were trophies, certificates of honor, and thick envelopes.

Those envelopes contained prize money: ten thousand yuan for first place, six thousand yuan for second place, and three thousand yuan for third place.

Even though the top 3 students didn’t lack money, they had earned this through their efforts, so they all felt very happy.

“Congratulations to the top 3 students for not only winning the prize money, but also earning the recommendation to the Capital University. I wonder if you would like to become one of us?” the principal asked. Although he thought that they wouldn’t refuse, he didn’t just assume that they would accept. Therefore, he asked respectfully.

“The Capital University is the highest institution of learning in the Seven Star Country and is the dream and goal of countless students, including me. So I’m honored to become a member,” said Leng Xiaoyao.

Anyway, they were all going to take the college entrance exam. Even if they didn’t get the recommendation, they would still take the exam for the Capital University.

Why did Leng Xiaoyao agree to join now when she had the ability to get in through the college entrance exam?

Well, that was because Leng Changyuan would be proud of her for getting into the Capital University!

The other two winners also expressed their willingness to attend the Capital University.

Even though they would have no problem getting into the Capital University without the recommendation, getting a scholarship through this competition sounded more prestigious and also waived their tuition fees!

Who wouldn’t want the recommendation that waived tuition fees? If someone didn’t want it, he might not be stupid. Perhaps he had better options.

The Capital University was great, but it didn’t offer every major. Some majors had their own specialized universities. Therefore, the Capital University wasn’t the only choice for top students.

Next, there would be TV reporters interviewing them.

Leng Xiaoyao was very agreeable, while the other two were a bit nervous but managed to keep their composure.

After the interview, everyone left. Along the way, other teachers praised the three winners and also comforted those who didn’t win.

Most of the students who participated admired the winners and reached out to be friendly, but there were also some who were jealous and hostile and ignored them.

Because everyone needed to pack up their things, they all went back to the hotel first. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

When Leng Xiaoyao returned to the hotel, Li Mochen was already there, in the parking lot outside.

As soon as she got out of the car, Leng Xiaoyao spotted Li Mochen’s car and him inside.

Upon seeing him, she couldn’t help but smile. She didn’t go to him right away, instead she went back to the hotel to pack her things before going to see him.

Seeing Leng Xiaoyao’s faint smile, Li Mochen was stunned and couldn’t snap out of it for a moment.

When he finally came to his senses, Leng Xiaoyao had already gone inside. He felt a wave of panic.

Leng Xiaoyao quickly packed up and left the hotel. Because Zhou Jing knew in advance, she didn’t say much. She only reminded Leng Xiaoyao to be careful.

Once Leng Xiaoyao walked out of the hotel, she walked towards Li Mochen’s car.

Just at that moment, Mu Beihan also came out and happened to see Leng Xiaoyao getting into Li Mochen’s car.

At first glance, she was shocked and blurted out dirty words. “What the f*ck!”

“What’s wrong?” Mr. Chen was startled by her sudden outburst and asked anxiously.

“Nothing,” Mu Beihan said, but she was extremely shocked. She recognized that car as Li Mochen’s. Leng Xiaoyao had a relationship with Li Mochen?

It was one thing if they had a relationship, but Leng Xiaoyao got into Li Mochen’s car and even sat in the passenger seat.

Although she didn’t see who was driving, it had to be Li Mochen.

For some reason, she just felt that it was Li Mochen, not Mu Yuan or Meng Fan.

Leng Xiaoyao was so beautiful and excellent at studying. Could it be that Li Mochen had taken a liking to her? Or maybe they were already together…

Mu Beihan didn’t know Li Mochen very well, but she had heard a bit about his personality and was aware that he wasn’t accessible, especially for women.

Therefore, when she saw Leng Xiaoyao getting into his car, she naturally believed that they had a different relationship.

…

Leng Xiaoyao saw Li Mochen wearing the clothes she gave him. No matter how she looked at it, it looked good. Accordingly, Leng Xiaoyao generously praised him. “Good-looking men look good in any clothes.”

Li Mochen was slightly shy, but he felt very happy. “What do you want to eat?”

Leng Xiaoyao thought for a moment. “Is there anything good to eat on the way to Hanlin Manor? I don’t want to go too far.”

“There’s a branch of Old Capital City Home-style Cuisine,” Li Mochen said. Actually, he had already noticed it when they came. He didn’t want to go too far either, but if Leng Xiaoyao wanted to go somewhere else, he would agree.

Old Capital City Home-style Cuisine was very famous in the capital city, with seven or eight branches just in the city alone. Each branch was very popular.

Old Capital City Home-style Cuisine didn’t focus on luxury, but on its specialties. Therefore, despite not being a high-end restaurant, many important figures still came to eat there.

When there were too many exotic delicacies, people would miss the specialties and home-cooked food.

“Great.” Leng Xiaoyao answered.

On the way, Leng Xiaoyao took a photo of the trophy and certificate of honor. Then she sent it to Leng Changyuan, Leng Yecheng, Wang Yiming, and the WeChat group of her friends.

They were important to her, so she wanted to share it with them first.

After sending the photos, she called Leng Changyuan and Wang Yiming to inform them. The others received WeChat messages, which were easy to see, but MMS messages were rarely noticed nowadays, so it was better to remind them.

“Grandpa, I finished the competition and got first place! I received a trophy and certificate of honor, as well as a prize of ten thousand yuan. I already sent you the photos via MMS, you can take a look,” Leng Xiaoyao said, unable to contain her joy.

“Really? You’re amazing.” Leng Changyuan was full of happiness. “Alright, I want to see photos of the trophy and certificate of honor right now.”

Eager to see the trophy and certificate of honor, Leng Changyuan didn’t say much to Leng Xiaoyao, leaving her speechless.

She then called Wang Yiming, but the line was busy.

Leng Yecheng soon saw the WeChat message sent by Leng Xiaoyao and immediately called her to praise her and offer her a reward. He asked what she wanted.
