Chapter 466 Gu Xiaoxiao, Qin Zheng and Chen Ziyao

People outside didn’t know what had happened in the private room, so the others were still enjoying themselves in the clubhouse.

After Gu Ning and her friends had left, only Situ Ye and Chu Xuanfeng were left in the private room.

Situ Ye lay against the sofa with an evil expression saying in a low voice, “It seems like someone can’t wait any longer.” Although he didn’t have evidence yet, Situ Ye already knew who was behind the attack.

In gangs, people schemed against each other even more cruelly than in politics. Once there were conflicts as to benefits or ambit, some would die. Besides, there were plenty of ways not to bear the legal result even if you killed a man in a gang. That was also the reason why so many people were afraid of the gangs because the gangs weren’t restricted by laws.

“What should we do next?” Chu Xuanfeng asked. He was displeased too, because he also knew who planned this.

“Create an accident and get rid of him!” Situ Ye ordered.

Actually, Situ Ye had planned to turn a blind eye, given that the person was one of the founders of the Qing Gang. However, since the person had already schemed to kill him, he wouldn’t mind killing a betrayer. Even though he didn’t have proof, it was still very easy for Situ Ye to kill a man.

Hao Ran and the others walked downstairs in shock and fear. None of them talked about what had just happened.

Seeing that Yu Mixi’s face was pale, Mu Ke seemed worried and asked her, “Are you alright?”

“I’m fine.” Yu Mixi forced a smile.

Gu Ning gave Mu Ke a glance before she looked to Yu Mixi. She saw affection in Mu Ke’s eyes towards Yu Mixi, but Yu Mixi didn’t show much love towards Mu Ke. Gu Ning didn’t know whether Yu Mixi just wanted Mu Ke to be her friend or if she didn’t realize that they could actually be boyfriend and girlfriend.

They were still so young, and had been friends for a long time. Maybe it wasn’t easy for both of them to make a step forward.

When they were about to walk out of the clubhouse, they met Qin Yifan in the hall. Qin Yifan had an appointment with his friends, and he was a little late. When he saw Gu Ning, he was struck dumb for a second, then wore a gentle smile. “Hi, Gu Ning and everyone. What a coincidence!”

Qin Yifan didn’t seem sad or helpless now because he had already gotten over it. Even though it still hurt when Gu Ning appeared in his sight, he soon calmed down.

“Hi, Yifan!” Gu Ning always had a good impression of Qin Yifan, so she treated him as friendly as ever.

“Are you going home now? It’s still early!” Qin Yifan said.

“Not really. We’re going to another place,” Gu Ning said. “We gotta go now. Have fun!”

“Sure, bye!” Qin Yifan said, and they separated.

Seeing Gu Ning walking away, Qin Yifan wore a wry smile. His heart still ached for her.

“It’s not even 10 pm now. Let’s go to V5 Bar! I need a drink to calm down,” Hao Ran said.

All of them looked at Gu Ning, waiting for her opinion.

“Why not?” Gu Ning said.

“Yay! You’re the best boss ever!” Chu Peihan exclaimed.

“Well, you can still go have fun without me,” Gu Ning said. Her friends always listened to her.

“If you’re absent, it’ll be much less fun,” Hao Ran said.

“Exactly!” Qin Zixun echoed.

Unexpectedly, when they had just reached the entrance of V5 Bar, they saw drama unfolding. And the roles in the scene were Gu Xiaoxiao, Chen Ziyao and Qin Zheng.

Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao were pulling and pushing against each other. Qin Zheng walked over and pushed Gu Xiaoxiao away. “Gu Xiaoxiao, enough!”

“Enough?” Gu Xiaoxiao was in a rage. “Qin Zheng, Chen Ziyao, how dare you do this to me? You’re my boyfriend and my best friend. How could you secretly be together behind my back!”

Hearing that, onlookers looked at Chen Ziyao and Qin Zheng with disdain.

“What? She slept with her best friend’s boyfriend?”

“Wow, what a drama!”

“Men always obey their sexual impulses!”

“You hit the point!”

“I think the girl is such a bitch that she stole the man away from her best friend!”

“I agree!”

People around them were all frequent customers of night clubs, so they didn’t bother to be polite.

Chen Ziyao had never been humiliated like that before, and burst into tears at once. Qin Zheng, as the boy, stayed strong.

“Shut up! You don’t know the situation, so stop criticizing us!” Qin Zheng snapped at them, then turned to Gu Xiaoxiao. “Gu Xiaoxiao, we already broke up, and it’s none of your business who I’m with now!”

“Broke up? When?” Gu Xiaoxiao questioned.

Hearing that, Qin Zheng panicked a little. In fact, Qin Zheng didn’t break up with Gu Xiaoxiao face to face. Gu Xiaoxiao had left City F, and they gradually stopped contacting each other. That being the case, they came to a silent agreement that they broke up with one another. However, when Gu Xiaoxiao found out that Qin Zheng became Chen Ziyao’s boyfriend, she couldn’t accept it, and felt like she had been betrayed. That was the cause of the scene.

Even though Qin Zheng didn’t break up with Gu Xiaoxiao face to face, he wouldn’t admit it in order to protect his image. “Gu Xiaoxiao, we broke up already, that’s the reason why we didn’t call each other at all recently. Have you ever seen a couple who doesn’t contact each other for a month?”

“You...” Gu Xiaoxiao was mad, but didn’t know how to argue back, because what Qin Zheng had said was the truth.

Her reaction was also caught by those onlookers, and they started to despise Gu Xiaoxiao now. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Oh, so the bitch is this girl? She’s so shameless to come on to the boy after they have already broken up.”
