Chapter 1461: Lady Leng

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Once Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua were far behind them, Gu Ning moved to the front passenger’s seat.

The front passenger’s seat was the exclusive girlfriend seat so Gu Ning wouldn’t leave it

vacant. She only hid herself on the rear seats earlier to avoid Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua.

“They will probably have to wait for forever,” Leng Shaoting joked.

“Ha-ha, they’ll leave when the building is empty!” Gu Ning said and felt amused.

When they arrived at the Leng family’s old house, it was 5:30 pm. Master Leng directly ignored Leng Shaoting and talked with Gu Ning for a long while. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Ningning, I’m so proud of you! You’re the first person to get a full score ever!” Master Leng was excited.

It was not only Master Leng, the other members of the Leng family also felt happy for Gu Ning. Actually, only Leng Yuanqian’s family held a grudge against Gu Ning, and the others, including the domestic servants, all had a good impression of Gu Ning.

“Miss Gu indeed has achieved an all-time record,” Leng Changzhi said with a broad smile. He truly liked Gu Ning, and not just because both Master Leng and Leng Shaoting liked her.

“Stop calling Ningning Miss Gu, you should call her Lady Leng from now on,” Master Leng said with a serious face.

Leng Shaoting smiled with satisfaction, but Gu Ning felt a little embarrassed. “Grandpa, it’s too early to do that.”

Master Leng, however, was displeased. “Why? If we had picked a perfect date this year, you two would have been engaged earlier on. You’ll be Lady Ning sooner or later.”

Hearing that, Gu Ning didn’t know what to say.

Leng Changzhi listened to Master Leng and called Gu Ning again, “Right, Lady Leng.”

“Well...” Gu Ning simply smiled and didn’t dare to argue with them.

They chatted for a while longer in the living room, then Master Leng went to his study with Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning had nothing else to do, so she told Leng Changzhi to bring her to Leng Shaoting’s room. She hadn’t seen his room yet, and was curious about it.

Because the Leng family’s old house had a long history, it still kept the style of the past even though it had been rebuilt once.

There was only one building in the Leng family’s old house, but it was the size of a football field. There was also a front and back yard with beautiful trees and flowers.

However, the Leng family’s old house was still hardly comparable with the Tang family’s house, because the Tang family was a super-rich business family while the Leng family was involved in politics.

The Leng family’s old house was a family inheritance, and members of the Leng family couldn’t afford such a big house with their salaries, because although members of the Leng family held important positions in the government, they were all upright officials.

Because they were officials in the government, they couldn’t run a business themselves, they could only invest in some businesses if they wanted to. Anyway, the money they made wasn’t enough to buy such a grand house.

This house cost at least hundreds of millions of yuan given its location, size, and decoration. Therefore, the Leng family only had great power in their country, and it didn’t have a fortune.

And except for Master Leng, no one knew that Leng Shaoting was the owner of the Shengshi Organization. Leng Shaoting had no intention to keep it a secret, but Master Leng told him not to tell the others.

The Shengshi Organization didn’t belong to the Leng family, it belonged to Leng Shaoting, because it was left to him by his maternal grandfather.

When outsiders heard that Leng Shaoting’s maternal grandfather left him many companies, Master Leng made up a lie and told them that Leng Shaoting had sold the companies because he was only a soldier and knew nothing about business.

As a result, no outsider knew how rich Leng Shaoting was. In addition, no one dared to steal money from Leng Shaoting.

Leng Shaoting’s room was the first one on the right on the third floor. He was the eldest grandson of Master Leng, so his room was placed in front of the other grandchildren. Leng Shaoming’s room was right next to his. Their rooms were basically of the same size.

There was a study at the entrance of Leng Shaoting’s room and it was about 30 square-meters big. His room was very big with a bathroom and a closet, and was big enough to accommodate two people.

However, because Leng Shaoting seldom stayed there, his room looked empty and it was obvious that no one had lived there for a long time. Nevertheless, even though he seldom came back, his room was always clean.

Leng Changzhi left after he brought Gu Ning to Leng Shaoting’s room and he told Gu Ning to enjoy herself.

Gu Ning walked around in Leng Shaoting’s room for a while, but soon felt bored.

An idea dawned her that she could have a look at Leng Shaoting’s parents room to see what she can find. She hoped that she could find something useful about Leng Shaoting’s mother and cultivators.

Thinking of that, Gu Ning decided to talk about it with Leng Shaoting later.
