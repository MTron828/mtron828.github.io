3414 Play the Blame Game

Wang Pengyu was somewhat intimidated by Leng Xiaoyao’s momentum, but he was unwilling to accept the result. “Stop talking nonsense here…”

“I don’t know if I’m talking nonsense or not, but you know it the best. By the way, I know a hacker who can investigate many things about you. If you insist that I’m talking nonsense, do you dare to let me investigate?” Leng Xiaoyao didn’t say that she was a hacker in order to avoid unnecessary trouble.

“You…” Wang Pengyu was scared because he was indeed guilty. After an investigation, his dirty secrets would all be exposed.

However, he was still struggling. He still hoped to win Ning Muqing’s trust. Therefore, he played the card of their romantic relationship. “Muqing, I’m innocent. You must trust me.”

“I want to trust you, but your reaction proves something different. If you are really innocent, do you dare to let her do an investigation? If you’re innocent, I’ll apologize and make it up to you and trust you in the future, but if what she said is true, I won’t let you go. You should know my personality.” Ning Muqing was very sad and upset. She liked him very much, but she didn’t lose her rationale. At this moment, she didn’t try to persuade herself to believe him or make excuses for him.

She knew that investigating a person would be disrespectful to that person, but in the current situation, if he didn’t admit it, she could only investigate him. She couldn’t continue to be with a man with problems like him.

“Ning Muqing, you clearly don’t love me at all. You don’t even have basic trust in me. You believe what a stranger says so easily. I think she was brought here by you on purpose to cause trouble for me.” Wang Pengyu played the blame game.

“Sir, if you have something to say, please go outside and don’t affect other customers in the store.” The waiter couldn’t stand it anymore and immediately stopped them.

“Shut up!” Wang Pengyu angrily rebuked. He was furious!

The waiter was mad that Wang Pengyu shouted at him.

The restaurant manager also came over and said coldly, “Sir, this is not a market. You are not allowed to make noise here. If you want to quarrel, please go outside. Otherwise we’ll call the police.”

When he heard that they were going to call the police, Wang Pengyu immediately calmed down.

“Go with me.” Wang Pengyu pulled Ning Muqing and wanted to talk about it after they were out.

“Let go of me.” Ning Muqing struggled. She didn’t want to go out with Wang Pengyu. His current appearance made her a little scared. What if he did something to her? How could she fight back?

Leng Xiaoyao immediately grabbed Wang Pengyu’s wrist, and Wang Pengyu let go of Ning Muqing because of the pain. He angrily rebuked. “Let go of me!”

Leng Xiaoyao ignored him and looked at Ning Muqing. “Do you need me to help you with this?”

Ning Muqing was really afraid of Wang Pengyu, so she naturally didn’t refuse. “Yes, thank you.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

From the moment Leng Xiaoyao blocked the ashtray and threw it back, she knew that Leng Xiaoyao was very strong, so she really needed her help at this moment.

“Ning Muqing, you…” Wang Pengyu glared at her, as if he was going to eat her alive.

Wang Pengyu looked at Leng Xiaoyao again and angrily said, “Don’t interfere.”

“Heh! You can’t stop me.” Leng Xiaoyao sneered.

“Wang Pengyu, we should break up!” Ning Muqing said. She didn’t want to entangle with Wang Pengyu any longer.

“I disagree.” Wang Pengyu immediately refused. If he broke up with Ning Muqing today, wouldn’t all his efforts be in vain?

“It’s not up to whether you agree or not. If you agree, we’ll part on good terms. If you don’t agree, then I’ll investigate you. If what this girl said is true, then what awaits you will be prison. Weigh it yourself.” Although she was betrayed by Wang Pengyu, she had really loved him. Therefore, Ning Muqing didn’t want to punish him too seriously and wanted to give Wang Pengyu some respect in the end.

However, if Wang Pengyu continued to entangle her, she wouldn’t hesitate to pay him back.

“Ning Muqing, why are you so cold-blooded?” Wang Pengyu pretended to be heart-broken as if it was Ning Muqing’s fault.

“Damn it, I can’t take it anymore. This man is too shameless…” Mu Beihan’s suppressed anger finally erupted. She immediately got up and grabbed Wang Pengyu’s collar and dragged him out.

How dare he question Ning Muqing for being cold-blooded? If he hadn’t tried to scheme against Ning Muqing, Ning Muqing wouldn’t have decided to leave him.

Who did this man think he was? Did he want to take advantage of Ning Muqing and stop her from fighting back? He was trash!

Although Wang Pengyu was a man, Mu Beihan had practiced martial arts, so her strength was naturally much stronger than that of an ordinary man. Therefore, Wang Pengyu couldn’t get rid of her.

The onlookers were all surprised by her strength.

However, after what Leng Xiaoyao did, Mu Beihan’s behavior became much more acceptable.

The staff in the café didn’t help Wang Pengyu. Instead, they breathed a sigh of relief when he was dragged out.

If he continued to cause trouble in the store, it would have a bad impact.

As long as they left the café, whatever happened to them would have nothing to do with the store.

Leng Xiaoyao and the others followed them out.

After leaving the café, Mu Beihan threw Wang Pengyu to the ground, attracting many onlookers.

“Tell me, how dare you calculate against your girlfriend’s property with the other woman, huh? Do you think there is no law in this world? Scum like you should go to hell. She didn’t call the police and gave you a way out, yet you blamed and accused us? I…” Mu Beihan scolded and felt unsatisfied. She caught up and gave Wang Pengyu a heavy kick.

As soon as other people heard that, everyone disdained Wang Pengyu.

“No, I didn’t!” Wang Pengyu still denied it.

“Since you won’t admit it and insist that we’re talking nonsense, then I can only investigate your affairs and make them public.” Leng Xiaoyao really lost her patience with Wang Pengyu. This man was extremely shameless.

“You…” Wang Pengyu was angry and wanted to refute, but was also afraid.

After hesitating for a while, he compromised. “Fine, I agree to break up and won’t entangle with Ning Muqing any longer. Can I leave now?”

Leng Xiaoyao squinted and felt that Wang Pengyu’s eyes weren’t quite right. Clearly they needed to keep an eye on him.

“You can go.” Leng Xiaoyao let him go.

Wang Pengyu immediately left. Although Ning Muqing was very sad, she was still relieved. “Thank you all for your help. If you have time, I would like to treat you to a meal. I hope you can accept it, otherwise I won’t be able to relax.”
