If his uncle wanted to do something again to hurt his family, he wouldn’t hesitate to pay his uncle back.

“Alright, I need to go back now. I’ll inform you once I’ve picked a good day for you, and no one should live here for the time being,” Zhou Shengquan said.

“No problem, let me drive you home,” Zhao Yecheng said.

When they were walking out, Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting to drive away.

“What did you see?” Leng Shaoting asked her.

Gu Ning then told Leng Shaoting everything she knew. Leng Shaoting hadn’t known that some trees could easily be visited by ghosts until now.

“Those trees attract ghosts, but it doesn’t mean that ghosts will certainly visit them and cause bad things to happen. There must be a reason for it, but we better not plant those trees in our home,” Gu Ning said.

It wasn’t uncommon that some people would plant willow trees and locust trees in their yards, especially when their houses were very large, but not all of them would encounter trouble.

If ghosts often visited a place, the place could have been a graveyard in the past, or someone might have been killed here. Anyway, ghosts wouldn’t come for no reason.

Zhou Shengquan seemed to be a skilled feng shui master, so Gu Ning didn’t bother to get involved in it this time.

She believed that he could handle it well.

...

Gu Ning hadn’t been to her company for days, so she decided to have a look today.

Shortly after she went back to her company, she received a call from Ning Changkai.

Ning Changkai told her that a man and a woman wanted to work with Colaine, but he declined so they insisted on seeing her.

Gu Ning frowned. It seemed that the two visitors weren’t kind.

“What’s her name?” Gu Ning asked.

“The woman told me that her name is Dongfang Ziyu,” Ning Changkai said.

Hearing that, Gu Ning squinted. If Dongfang Ziyu really came to see her, she wouldn’t mind meeting her. She was curious to know why Dongfang Ziyu insisted on seeing her.

Gu Ning had no grudge against Dongfang Ziyu, so she didn’t understand why Dongfang Ziyu did it. Was it possible that Dongfang Ziyu found out about her secret?

“Is she a young woman?” Gu Ning asked.

“Yes,” Ning Changkai said. He thought that Gu Ning might know this woman.

“Great, I’ll see her, tell them to wait for a while. I’ll be there in half an hour,” Gu Ning said, then hung up the call.

After that, Gu Ning told Leng Shaoting to stay in her office, and that she would meet Dongfang Ziyu alone.

Gu Ning didn’t want Leng Shaoting to go with her, because she was worried that other cultivators might notice his change.

Leng Shaoting listened to her and stayed in her office.

Luckily, the traffic wasn’t heavy, so Gu Ning arrived after 20 minutes.

The moment she approached the guest room, she sensed the special air of cultivators, so she knew that the visitor must be Dongfang Ziyu. Wu Shunhua came with Dongfang Ziyu this time, and Gu Ning had met him before too.

She wasn’t surprised when she saw their faces.

Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua also stayed calm, because they had learned a lot about Gu Ning on the Internet before they came. To their astonishment, the owner of Colaine was a very young girl. It was very unbelievable for a young girl to own such a profitable business.

“Nice to see you, Miss Gu,” they politely greeted Gu Ning. However, even though they behaved politely, Dongfang Ziyu still looked a little arrogant. She had always been very proud of herself, and almost looked down her nose at everyone, especially at mortals.

In many cultivators’ eyes, mortals were inferior to them. After all, cultivators were much stronger than mortals, and they could easily defeat mortals. However, there was a rule in the cultivation world that cultivators couldn’t casually hurt mortals when there was no benefit conflict.

In fact, the four dominant families weren’t the most powerful cultivators in the cultivation world. The only orthodox sect in the cultivation world was Tiandaomen, and there were countless senior cultivators with useful guides in it, so many cultivators dreamed about joining it. However, it wasn’t easy for other people to join Tiandaomen, because Tiandaomen only accepted talented cultivators.

Baili Zongyang, Baili Zongxue, and Dongfang Ziyu were members of Tiandaomen. Tiandaomen was the most respected sect in the cultivation world, and it also had the power to punish cultivators if they did anything wrong. Therefore, normally cultivators didn’t dare to cause trouble in mortals’ world.

“May I help?” Gu Ning walked towards Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua with the air of a king.

Both Dongfang Ziyu and Wu Shunhua were surprised by it.
