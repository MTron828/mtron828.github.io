Chapter 2640: Pay the Jing Family Back

??

There were only twenty thousand people in the cultivation world and the City Sky had a population of seven thousand people. Before Jing Yunyao got lost, she didn’t stay at home all day long, so many people were familiar with her, and easily recognized her.

Even though not everyone knew that she was “dead” that year, they heard that she married a mortal before disappearing. They weren’t sure whether she was still alive.

Therefore, it was shocking when she suddenly showed up.

“Isn’t that Miss Jing?”

“Right!”

“She’s disappeared for over twenty years. I thought she was dead, but unexpectedly she’s back.”

In the eyes of the Leng family, Jing Yunyao had disappeared for sixteen years, but for the cultivation world, she had been gone for over twenty, nearly thirty years.

Because Jing Yunyao went to the mortal world first then disappeared after twelve years.

“Miss Jing isn’t only back, she’s back with Senior Shangguan.”

“What’s their relationship?”

“Who knows!”

“…”

“I heard that Senior Mrs. Jing has bullied Miss Jing many times before. Is she injured because of Miss Jing?”

“I think it’s possible.”

“If it’s true, I think Senior Mrs. Jing deserves it. If anyone dares to bully me, I’ll pay him or her back after I become strong.”

“Right, the Jing family will be in trouble. Why don’t we go and watch the drama?”

Although they didn’t know the details and truth behind Jing Yunyao’s disappearance, they guessed it must have something to do with Jing Yaorong.

Besides, it wasn’t a secret in City Sky that Senior Mrs. Jing and her kids treated Jing Yunyao very badly in the past. Therefore, there had to be a fight after Jing Yunyao came back.

They didn’t think that Jing Yunyao came back just to see her family!

“I want to, but can we get in? I don’t think so.”

“You’re right.”

“…”

Many people felt it was a shame that they couldn’t watch the drama, while Senior Mrs. Jing was full of anger. Those onlookers couldn’t wait to see the Jing family in trouble!

The Jing family had a bad reputation and not many citizens supported them. However people didn’t dare to criticize the Jing family because the Jing family had a high status.

Although they couldn’t get into the Jing family’s house, they still followed Gu Ning and the others. They might have to stop at the gate, but they were still interested in what would happen.

Jing Yunyao said nothing when more and more people started to follow them. Anyway, they would have to stop outside the gate later, and wouldn’t know what was happening. Nevertheless, there should be news coming out, so Jing Yunyao didn’t care.

From a distance, the security guards at the gate of the Jing family’s house saw a large group of people coming over. At the beginning, they couldn’t see them clearly and weren’t sure that they were coming towards the Jing family’s house, so they did nothing and just watched.

However, when they were sure that the large group of people were coming to the Jing family’s house, a security guard turned to go into the house and reported it to the housekeeper.

Because they couldn’t go into the inside rooms, they could only report it to the housekeeper and the housekeeper would deliver the message to Jing Yaorong. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

After they came closer, another security guard saw them clearly. He didn’t know Shangguan Yang, Leng Shaoting, and Gu Ning, but he recognized Senior Mrs. Jing.

“Senior Mrs. Jing, are you alright?” The security guard was shocked when he saw that Senior Mrs. Jing was injured all over.

Senior Mrs. Jing said nothing, because she didn’t know what she could say.

Afterwards, the security guard was amazed to see Jing Yunyao. “M-Miss Jing?”

The Jing family’s domestic servants had no idea that Jing Yunyao was still alive, but they all heard that she was killed by Jing Yaorong. Although it was just a guess, they believed it was the truth. After all, they knew Jing Yaorong very well.

As a result, the security guard was scared when a person, who was supposed to have died over a dozen years ago, suddenly showed up before him.

“Can you let us in? Or must we force our way inside?” Jing Yunyao asked calmly.

Hearing that, the security guard walked away at once. He didn’t dare to stop them.

He knew Jing Yaorong hated Jing Yunyao and didn’t treat her as his daughter at all. If Jing Yaorong learned that Jing Yunyao was back, he wouldn’t allow her to walk into the Jing family’s house, but they seemed aggressive and the security guard couldn’t stop them!

Besides, Senior Mrs. Jing was with them.

After the security guard walked away, Jing Yunyao and the others went in, leaving the onlookers watching outside.

As soon as they got in, the gate was closed. In that case, no one would know what was happening inside.

After that, some people left, but some stayed and waited to see whether they could see anything. They didn’t leave right away.

When the housekeeper heard the news, he didn’t rush to see Jing Yaorong, instead he went out to find out more. He wanted to know whether he could handle it alone.

As a housekeeper, he had to have the ability to deal with all kinds of problems. He couldn’t bother the patriarch all the time. If it was beyond his abilities, he would turn to the patriarch for help.

Right after the housekeeper walked out of the front hall, he saw Jing Yunyao and the others in the front yard. Even though he already knew that Jing Yunyao was still alive and would come back to the Jing family sooner or later, he was still frightened when he saw her face to face.

Jing Yunyao was a master at the Yuan Ying Period now and her son was also in the same stage. They had Shangguan Yang’s support too.

The housekeeper, on the other hand, was only in the primary stage of the Golden Core Stage, so he couldn’t see Jing Yunyao’s exact level and thought that she was at the Yuan Ying Period.

Afterwards, he noticed the injured Senior Mrs. Jing and immediately figured it out.

He didn’t know that Senior Mrs. Jing left to find an evil cultivator to kill Jing Yunyao and Leng Shaoting, but he knew that Senior Mrs. Jing left home.

During the past few days, Jing Yunyan couldn’t find Senior Mrs. Jing so she had to be in trouble. Given the current situation, it must have something to do with Jing Yunyao.

The housekeeper couldn’t solve this problem, so he could only go to see Jing Yaorong.

“Please give me a moment. I need to report this to the patriarch.” The housekeeper politely said to Jing Yunyao and the others. He was polite mainly because of Shangguan Yang. After all, given Shangguan Yang’s status, he didn’t dare to be rude.

“What I’m going to say is really shocking. If you don’t want outsiders to hear it, we should deal with it in the backyard,” said Jing Yunyao.
