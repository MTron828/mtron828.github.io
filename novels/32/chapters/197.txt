Chapter 198: Leng Shaoting Was Jealous

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning of course would not take advantage of her customers, and the jewelry would only be heavier, not lighter. It wasn’t a big deal to let the customers buy the jewelry at a lower price.

It hadn’t cost her much money to get the jade after all.

Zhou Zhenghong guided the guests to have a meal in the Huangdeng Hotel later.

Qin Yifan and the other two didn’t show up at all from the beginning to the end.

All the staff remained in the store, and didn’t follow Zhou Zhenghong to the hotel; they would eat in the afternoon.

The Jade Beauty Jewelry store wasn’t far away from the Huangdeng Hotel. It only took several minutes to walk there, so most walked while some drove.

During that break, Leng Shaoting said to Gu Ning, “Please follow me. I have something to give you.”

“What is it?” Gu Ning was surprised and curious. She followed Leng Shaoting to his car in the parking lot.

Leng Shaoting took out a wooden box from his car. It was as big as two palms.

Gu Ning opened the wooden box, and felt a strong power hit her face. She trembled a little, but when she saw what was inside, she couldn’t believe her eyes. There were two huge diamonds in it. One was blue, and the other was red. Both were as big as a quail’s egg.

There was also a blood-red jade bracelet and a purple jade the size of an egg. It was a top-level jade called Purple Eye.

Gu Ning didn’t know the price of the diamonds, but she knew that of the Purple Eye jade and the blood-red jade bracelet.

Purple Eye jade was at the same level as Fulushou jade. This Purple Eye jade was as big as an egg, and it must be worth at least a couple dozen million yuan.

And the blood-red jade bracelet was even more precious. Gu Ning had read the news on the Internet that a blood-red jade bracelet which weighed 46 grams had been sold at the price of four hundred and eighty million yuan at auction, but this blood-red jade bracelet in the box was even several grams heavier!

Price at auction was normally much higher than at market price. And the exact price of jewelry actually depended on the buyer. Gold for instance, it was worth three hundred yuan a gram sometimes, and was worth two hundred yuan a gram at other times. Its price changed.

“It’s more precious than his,” Leng Shaoting said airily.

Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second, and didn’t know what to say.

Leng Shaoting explained further, “The blood-red jade bracelet is more precious than the red coral.”

Hearing that, Gu Ning immediately understood what Leng Shaoting meant. She snorted with laughter all of a sudden.

Leng Shaoting was jealous just because Situ Ye had sent her a valuable natural red coral!

Gu Ning teased, “Are you jealous?”

Leng Shaoting flushed feeling uneasy, but he didn’t deny it.

Gu Ning didn’t know what to do. Leng Shaoting was being so sensitive. He had been jealous of Situ Ye twice today.

Actually, it wasn’t completely Leng Shaoting’s fault. Because Gu Ning hadn’t agreed to be his girlfriend yet, he didn’t feel secure. He was afraid that Gu Ning would reject him once he didn’t perform well.

“I like it very much,” saying that, Gu Ning put the blood-red jade bracelet on her wrist.

Gu Ning not only liked it, but was also deeply moved. It was so beautiful and precious. Most importantly, it was from Leng Shaoting. Thus except for the blood-red jade bracelet, Gu Ning absorbed all the power from the rest in the box.

Her Jade Eyes were already full of power yesterday, and the telepathic eye space expanded a square meters afterwards.

“Where did you get these?” Gu Ning asked with curiosity. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“I picked some up in the middle of fulfilling tasks. And others sent me some. I have many more of them in the capital,” Leng Shaoting said.

Leng Shaoting had no interest in jewelry. It was nothing different than a stone in Leng Shaoting’s eyes. If it hadn’t been priceless, Leng Shaoting wouldn’t have kept it.

Now since he found out that Gu Ning liked jewelry, he would keep it well for her.

Gu Ning didn’t know that Leng Shaoting had gone back to the capital in order to bring the jewelry to her until now. She felt like crying once more. This man didn’t say sweet nothings, but everything he had done was more special and meaningful than oral promises. Actions spoke louder than words after all.

Gu Ning curbed her impulse to cry saying, “Could you please keep it for me for a while? It isn’t convenient for me to take it right now.”

It indeed wasn’t convenient for her to hold such a big box. And with Leng Shaoting’s presence, she wasn’t able to put it into the telepathic eye space.

Leng Shaoting took the wooden box and laid it back in its original place.

After that, the two went straight to the Huangdeng Hotel. Because Master Bai and the other important figures were there too, Gu Ning couldn’t be absent.

What had happened at the opening ceremony of Jade Beauty Jewelry went abroad before it aired on the News At Half Past Six . The news went viral on the Internet within a short time. Everyone was shocked by the opening ceremony of Jade Beauty Jewelry, especially peers who worked in the jewelry industry.

Luckily, Jade Beauty Jewelry only made jade jewelry, and wasn’t involved in other kinds of jewelry yet.

Meanwhile, Shao Ping finally woke up, but his first reaction was to ask the condition of Jade Beauty Jewelry, instead of himself or his car.

Mrs. Shao had kept her eyes on the news of Jade Beauty Jewelry, and was quiet jealous of it. “Honey, Jade Beauty Jewelry is big news today! Over a half of the celebrities in City G have attended its opening ceremony, including the Ai Family, the Bai Family, the Qinghua Group, the Ou Family, the Fu Family and even the mayor! The Chief of Staff also...”

Before Mrs. Shao could finish, Shao Ping was hit heavily by the news. He spat a mouthful of blood before he fainted again.

“Honey! honey! Doctor, please...” Mrs. Shao panicked running to the doctor at once.

At the same time, Wei Zhiming, who was the general manager of the entertainment industry of the Qing Gang, made up his mind that his son had to be revenged, even though it was his son’s fault. He would protect his son no matter whose fault it was. However, he hesitated after he found out that Leng Shaoting’s car belonged to the Ai Family.

The Qing Gang wasn’t afraid of the Ai Family, but Wei Zhiming was afraid of it.
