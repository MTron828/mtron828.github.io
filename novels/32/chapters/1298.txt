Chapter 1299: The Fifth Place

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Although Yu Yin rarely talked to Leng Shaoting, she didn’t think that he was a thorn in her side.

Leng Yuanzhen and Yu Yin treated Leng Shaoting as a close relative, but Leng Shaoting wasn’t used to it and always stayed alone.

Compared with Leng Yuanqian and his wife, Leng Yuanzhen and Yu Yin were much kinder.

Leng Shaoting actually also had the idea to marry Gu Ning right now, but Gu Ning was only 19 this year, so he had to wait for another three years. Three years were a very long time!

Gu Ning was amused by Leng Shaoting’s reaction, but she could do nothing about it. It was fate.

A while later, Jiang Shuyuan got back, and she seemed displeased to see Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting as well. However, she behaved better than Leng Shaojia.

“Hi, father,” Jiang Shuyuan greeted Master Leng and closed her mouth.

“Hi,” Master Leng said lightly.

“Oh, is Shaojia home?” Jiang Shuyuan asked.

“She went upstairs the moment she got back,” Master Leng replied.

“Father, did Shaojia tell that she ranked 11th in the National Gown Design Competition till now? Only 20 designers are selected for the final round. If she can be one of the top 10 in the final, her designs will directly be sent to Paris Fashion Week and she’ll be famous!” Jiang Shuyuan said with great pride.

“Great, it’s good news.” Master Leng, however, didn’t think it was impressive.

Jiang Shuyuan was upset when Master Leng didn’t seem excited at all.

Gu Ning, however, thought about whether Yu Zi was in the competition as well. Coincidentally, Yu Zi called her at this moment.

Gu Ning excused herself and left to answer her call. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hey, boss, good news! I ranked 5th in the National Gown Design Competition among the top 20 till now. If I can have a position in the top 10 at the end, my designs will directly be sent to Paris Fashion Week. It’s a great honor,” Yu Zi said with excitement.

Yu Zi called Gu Ning at this time, because all of the contestants heard the news just then.

Leng Shaojia went back home in a good mood precisely because she ranked 11th in the competition. She planned to tell Master Leng the good news, but her good mood was ruined by Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting’s appearance.

“Congratulations! I believe that you can do better,” Gu Ning said.

With Gu Ning’s help, Yu Zi was becoming increasingly successful and famous. She met Jason afterwards, which meant she was very likely to become the next well-known international clothing designer.

Yu Zi was full of hope and anticipation now.

“Thank you, boss!” Yu Zi thanked Gu Ning and even sobbed on the phone. “I wouldn’t have today’s success without you. I promise that you have my loyalty forever.” Gu Ning had helped her a lot, and she felt grateful to her.

In fact, nobody could be more influential than Gu Ning now given her family background and connections. It was a smart decision for Yu Zi to follow Gu Ning.

“Great, I’m glad to hear that.” Gu Ning smiled.

After talking with Yu Zi, Gu Ning walked back to the living room.

“What’s wrong? Do you need to deal with something else?” Master Leng asked her with concern.

“Oh, no, it’s one of my subordinates. She also participated in the National Gown Design Competition and reached the final,” Gu Ning said on purpose.

“Really? What’s her place?” Master Leng asked with surprise, but Jiang Shuyuan looked mad.

Master Leng’s attitude changed once he heard that Gu Ning’s subordinate had also reached the final.

Jiang Shuyuan glared at Gu Ning.

Gu Ning didn’t mind, but Leng Shaoting was annoyed and gave Jiang Shuyuan a cold look, which scared Jiang Shuyuan and she moved her eyes away at once. Jiang Shuyuan didn’t dare to offend Leng Shaoting.

“She ranked 5th,” Gu Ning said. She said it calmly, like it wasn’t a big deal.

Jiang Shuyuan, on the contrary, felt like she just made herself a joke because Leng Shaojia only ranked 11th.

“She ranked 5th? Good for her!” Master Leng complimented.

“I think she’s going to win a place in the top 10 since she already ranks 5th now,” Yu Yin said.
