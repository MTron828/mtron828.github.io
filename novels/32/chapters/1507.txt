Chapter 1509: Someone Wants to Jump down the Rooftop

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

As for the existing monsters and ghosts, Gu Ning didn’t tell them many details, because it was hard to explain it very clearly at this moment. She decided to tell them more after they totally accepted it.

“Sure,” Gao Yi and Qiao Ya said.

“Take those pills with you. They can save your lives if any accidents happen,” Gu Ning said.

“We understand,” Gao Yi and Qiao Ya said. After that, they fell into silence again and the atmosphere became serious.

A while later, Gu Ning noticed many people standing under a tall office building and they all looked up.

A man was sitting on the edge of the balcony of the top floor of the office building. His legs were dangling, and it seemed like he was going to jump.

Gu Ning focused on the man’s face, and was astonished once she recognized it. The man was Zhao Binxu, and Gu Ning knew him.

Zhao Binxu was a real estate businessman. Although his company wasn’t large, it was profitable and had potential.

In Gu Ning’s previous incarnation, Zhao Binxu won against the Tang family for a bid held by the government for a piece of land. Because connections didn’t work that time, the Tang family lost the bid.

If there was a huge gap between them, Tang Bingsen would accept the result, but there wasn’t so Tang Bingsen hated Zhao Binxu afterwards.

Before long, he ordered Tang Aining to damage the houses built by Zhao Binxu. The Administration for Industry and Commerce got involved in it and forced Zhao Binxu to stop selling them. As a result, Zhao Binxu suffered a great loss and went bankrupt. Luckily, he didn’t have debts and kept his house and car.

Gu Ning didn’t know what had happened to him after that.

Since she had done many bad deeds in her previous incarnation, she decided to help those who were in crisis because of her if she met them. It was her way of making up for the bad deeds she had done.

“Yi, stop the car at the roadside now,” Gu Ning said to Gao Yi at once, and Gao Yi listened to her.

“Ya, get out of the car with me,” Gu Ning said to Qiao Ya before she stepped out of the car.

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya understood that Gu Ning was going to do something at this moment. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Why does he want to jump from this building? He’ll lose everything once he does that.”

“His wife and daughter are crying so hard. They’re pitiful.”

“Maybe he is despairing.”

“I don’t think he really wants to die, because he’s stayed there for a long time.”

“I think he’s waiting for something.”

“Right.”

“...”

Onlookers were talking about it with excitement.

Gu Ning and Qiao Ya went to stand under the office building. Because firemen were still absent, Zhao Binxu would die if he really jumped down right now.

Even if Gu Ning was able to catch him, it would immediately cause big news. It was a bright day after all, and there were many people around them. Therefore, she couldn’t do it in front of everyone.

Among the crowd, a woman and a girl in tears were begging Zhao Binxu not to jump. They were Zhao Binxu’s wife and 15-year-old daughter.

“Please, don’t jump, don’t abandon us.”

“Dad, please come down safely. Mom and I can’t live without you.”

“Please...”

“...”

“Ya, go up there right now. If you can stop him at the roof, it’ll be the best. If not, I’ll try to negotiate with him and you can seize the chance to pull him off the edge,” Gu Ning said to Qiao Ya.

“Sure.” Qiao Ya nodded and ran into the building without delay. This was an office building, and she had to get to the top as soon as possible.

At the same time, Gu Ning walked to Mrs. Zhao and asked her, “Madam, may I know why your husband wants to commit suicide?”

However, before Mrs. Zhao could say anything, onlookers began to criticize Gu Ning. “Hey, why do you ask that question right now? Don’t you see her crying?”

“Don’t gossip!”

“...”

Some onlookers thought that they stood with the side of justice, so they blamed Gu Ning in annoyance.

Gu Ning ignored them and focused on Mrs. Zhao. If Mrs. Zhao was willing to tell her, she would listen. If not, she wouldn’t force her to do it. She wanted to know why Zhao Binxu chose to jump off the building so that she could help him.

Mrs. Zhao understood that Gu Ning was just being kind, so she said, “My husband was deceived by his friend in an investment. He’s burdened with debts now, but his friend refuses to admit it...”

Zhao Binxu’s daughter, Zhao Jinghan, didn’t see Gu Ning until now, and she was struck dumb for a long while before she recognized Gu Ning.

“G-Goddess Gu? Oh my, you are Goddess Gu! Please help my father, Goddess Gu. I don’t want to lose my father,” Zhao Jinghan cried again.

Zhao Jinghan knew that Gu Ning had saved a lot of innocent people, so she believed that Gu Ning could help her father out too.
