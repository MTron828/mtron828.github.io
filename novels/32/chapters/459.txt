Chapter 460 Selfish Gu Qinxiang

“Of-of course you are!” Gu Ning had to admit that Leng Shaoting was quite good in bed, but she could hardly afford to at the moment because with Gu Ning’s affirmative answer, Leng Shaoting moved harder.

“I can’t. I can’t take it anymore.” Gu Ning wanted to stop him, but he wouldn’t stop. And Gu Ning wasn’t willing to protect herself in such a situation because even though it was overwhelming, she still wanted to feel it.

“Ningning, I love you. I love you so much!” Leng Shaoting didn’t stop, because he was about to come and wanted to rub Gu Ning into his body.

“Shaoting, I love you too! I really love you too!”

Gu Ning’s sweet words made Leng Shaoting moved more violently. It was a little too violent for Gu Ning to enjoy it, but she still had a nice orgasm.

The next day, Gu Man and Gu Qing left their homes around 8:30 am. Jiang Xu drove them to the shopping mall before he went to his store.

Jiang Xu’s construction material store was gradually becoming popular. Especially after Gu Ning’s identity had been exposed, many businessmen would turn to Jiang Xu for cooperation in order to maintain a good relationship with Gu Ning’s family. Therefore, Jiang Xu was very busy now.

Ever since Gu Qing and Gu Man left Fenghua Luxury Mansion, Tang Yunfan followed them.

Leng Shaoting got up early that morning as usual to prepare breakfast for Gu Ning. However, Gu Ning was so exhausted that she didn’t wake up until 9 am.

After breakfast, Leng Shaoting pressed her into his arms and they had sex again. When it was almost 10 am, they left for Huangdeng Hotel.

Gu Qing and Gu Man went to a nearby restaurant to dine together. Unexpectedly, Gu Qinxiang showed up out of the blue and came to borrow money from Gu Qing and Gu Man.

“Qing, Man, I know that I’ve done many things wrong, but let bygones be bygones. We’re biological siblings. Can’t you help this time?” Gu Qinxiang said. It was the first time that he ever had been so polite to Gu Qing and Gu Man.

Biological siblings? Gu Qinxiang was utterly shameless. Not only had he bullied them ever since they were young, he had also refused to lend them money when Gu Ning had been in the car accident and could have died at any moment. And now, he suddenly played the family card when trying to borrow money from them?

Gu Qing and Gu Man stayed calm and cold. “No, we can’t help you. Please stay away from us,” Gu Man said.

“How-how can you be so cold-blooded?” Although this wasn’t the first time Gu Qinxiang had been rejected, he couldn’t accept

it.

They were cold-blooded? Gu Qing immediately retorted. “When Ningning was in that car accident, we went to borrow just ten thousand yuan from you, but you refused without hesitation! Ningning could have died! Do you think it’s possible that you can borrow dozens of millions of yuan from us now?”

Although it wasn’t Gu Qinxiang’s duty to lend them money, he was rich and Gu Ning’s life had been in danger. However, he still refused to help them, he was very selfish. Gu Qing and Gu Man weren’t dumb, nor were they weak. It was quite understandable that Gu Man wasn’t willing to lend him money.

Tang Yunfan was sitting at the table next to them, so he heard their conversation clearly. He was very mad that Ningning’s biological uncle was such a selfish and shameless man.

“Ningning’s fine now. What’s the big deal?” Gu Qinxiang argued. He didn’t feel guilty at all.

This time, Gu Qing and Gu Man couldn’t tolerate it anymore. “How can you say that!” Gu Qing criticized him in anger.

“We will not lend you any money. It doesn’t matter what you think of us,” Gu Man said coldly.

“You can sell your company if you want money. We were able to live our life on dozens of thousands of yuan a year in the past, and you can survive too.”

“Gu Man! Are you saying that we can’t live a good life?” Gu Qinxiang snapped at Gu Man. In his eyes, Gu Man couldn’t wait to see him living a poor life.

“I don’t care what you think of us. It has nothing to do with us whether you live a good life or not! If you dare to harass us again, we’ll call the police!” Gu Man said icily.

“You...” Gu Qinxiang was furious, but couldn’t say anything. He was so selfish that he would never blame himself for his own mistakes.

“Ah! How can he be so shameless! I’m so mad that I have such a useless older brother!” Gu Qing said.

“There, there. It isn’t worth being upset over such a man.” Gu Man comforted her.

Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin left for the airport together around 12 am.

On the way, Leng Shaoting stayed quiet, because he didn’t want to leave Gu Ning. Gu Ning also had the same feeling, but they had to deal with their own businesses.

When they arrived at the airport, Leng Shaoting didn’t leave until Gu Ning walked into the lounge and disappeared from his sight. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The gates Gu Ning and Cao Wenxin would be boarding through weren’t far from each other, so Gu Ning went to sit with Cao Wenxin while they were waiting.

At this time, Xin Bei walked over.

They were all surprised to see each other again.

“Hi, Gu Ning, are you going to City B too?” Xin Bei asked Gu Ning and ignored Cao Wenxin. Cao Wenxin also turned her eyes away from him.
