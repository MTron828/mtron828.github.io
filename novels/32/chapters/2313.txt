Chapter 2316: Meet Qi Ziyue Again

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

She was too shocked earlier, so she forgot that.

Without delay, Gu Ning called Leng Shaoting, but his phone was still turned off. Perhaps he was carrying out a task.

Left with no choice, Gu Ning could only go back. In order to not lose Leng Shaoting, She sent Leng Shaoting a message so that he would call her back after he turned on his phone.

Gu Ning: Shaoting, this is Ningning. Call me back once you read this message.

Gu Ning wanted to say a lot to him, but the message was too short. Most importantly, Gu Ning was worried about whether Leng Shaoting still remembered her after he traveled back in time to two years ago. Therefore, it wasn’t a good idea if she said too much in the message.

Gu Ning was very afraid that Leng Shaoting would forget her, because she honestly would know what to do then. Anyway, it was useless to be worried now. She needed to see him first.

In case Leng Shaoting forgot her or didn’t call her back after reading her message, she called him every two hours.

At 5:30 pm, Gu Ning was on her way back to the city center. Her phone suddenly rang and it was Qi Ziyue.

In a terrible mood, Gu Ning didn’t want to pick up Qi Ziyue’s call. She was unwilling to waste time on him now.

Did she still hate Qi Ziyue after traveling back in time?

She still hated him a little, but didn’t hate him to death. After all, she had already taken revenge after her reincarnation. However, it didn’t mean that she would tolerate him if they dared to mess with her.

Her phone continued to ring. Gu Ning couldn’t turn it off, because she was worried that she might miss Leng Shaoting’s call.

However, if Qi Ziyue wouldn’t stop calling her, Leng Shaoting wouldn’t be able to get through to her because of the busy line. Therefore, Gu Ning directly blacklisted Qi Ziyue’s number.

About ten minutes later, Gu Ning’s phone rang again. She felt that it must be Qi Ziyue. He couldn’t get through to her, so he used another number.

However, even if it might be Qi Ziyue, Gu Ning felt that it could also be Leng Shaoting, so she still answered it.

The moment Gu Ning picked it up, she heard Qi Ziyue’s angry scolding. “Tang Aining, what’s wrong with you? I called you so many times. Why didn’t you answer it? I couldn’t get through to you afterwards. Did you blacklist my number?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

She wasn’t surprised that it turned out to be Qi Ziyue, but she was disappointed that it wasn’t Leng Shaoting.

As a result, Gu Ning coldly said, “Qi Ziyue, don’t call me again. Leave me alone, or I’m afraid I’ll lose control and kill you.”

Qi Ziyue was obviously scared by Gu Ning’s words. After seconds of silence, he said, “Tang Aining, what did you say? How dare you say that to me?”

“How dare I say that to you? Because I know your real purpose. Qi Ziyue, I’m warning you to stay away from me, or I’ll really kill you.” Gu Ning threatened, then hung up on him.

This time, she really didn’t want to see Qi Ziyue, or she might lose control of herself and kill him when she saw him living a good life. She had the same attitude towards Tang Bingsen, Tang Yaxin, and Ji Yijing.

After that, Gu Ning didn’t receive a call from Qi Ziyue again.

About ten minutes later, Tang Bingsen called her. Obviously, Qi Ziyue told Tang Bingsen what she had said to him and Tang Bingsen took action.

Gu Ning was unwilling to answer his call, but she didn’t want him to occupy her line, so she picked it up in the end.

“Ningning, come home tonight. We’ll dine together,” said Tang Bingsen in a cold voice without any affection for a daughter as a father.

“No, I need to deal with something else.” Gu Ning directly refused. She knew it was a treacherous plot and there was a trap laid for her ahead!

She wasn’t afraid, but she was in no mood to deal with them. If she went to see them, she might lose control of herself and kill them. After all, after she was reincarnated, it took a lot of effort to take revenge. Now they were alive and standing in front of her, and she would feel what she had done was meaningless.

“What do you need to deal with? Come home now. I need to see you.” Tang Bingsen ordered in a serious tone.

Gu Ning almost swore at him. Without a word, she directly hung up on Tang Bingsen and blacklisted his number.

After a few minutes, Gu Ning’s phone rang again. It was Ji Yijing, but Gu Ning hung up without hesitation. No matter how they called her, she refused to answer their calls.

They sent her messages afterwards and threatened her to go back home, but Gu Ning ignored all of them.

When she got back to the city center, it was slightly past 6 pm. It was time for dinner, but Gu Ning didn’t have any appetite, so she went directly back to her apartment.

However, right after Gu Ning got out of her car, she was surrounded by five men in black suits, including Qi Ziyue.

Upon seeing Qi Ziyue, Gu Ning was mad and had the thought of killing him.

Her mind was in a mess. She didn’t realize that Tang Bingsen would send people to catch her at her apartment after failing to get through to her.

Anyway, she was back now, and she didn’t think those men could catch her. They were no match for her after all.

Qi Ziyue looked at Gu Ning, no, Tang Aining with mixed emotions.

Because she had said that she knew his real purpose on the phone, he got anxious and reported it to Tang Bingsen. They wanted to know whether Tang Aining had found out something abnormal. He believed that he had acted very well in front of Tang Aining. How could she find out their dirty secrets?

“Aining, your father wants to see you,” said Qi Ziyue in a gentle tone as always. However, he came with many bodyguards, which made his words barely persuasive.

“Qi Ziyue, didn’t you hear what I said on the phone?” Gu Ning squinted at him, her voice icy.

She was so strange in Qi Ziyue’s eyes now that he even felt frightened facing her.

Qi Ziyue was only an ordinary man, while Tang Aining was a professional killer, so ordinary people couldn’t bear the pressure she put on them.

Qi Ziyue understood that Tang Aining was very strong, so he brought several strong bodyguards with him.

“Aining, what happened?” Although Qi Ziyue guessed that Tang Aining might have found out their dirty secrets, he was reluctant to admit it without an affirmative answer.

“It seems you won’t leave me alone if I don’t make it very clear.” Gu Ning sneered. Qi Ziyue seemed to hold out hope until faced with the grim reality..
