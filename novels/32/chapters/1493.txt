Chapter 1494: Help Me

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Once Gu Ning arrived, she directly walked towards Tang Yaxin’s ward which was on the 7th floor.

It was already past 12 am, so there were only a few people walking around in the hospital.

However, an accident happened on Gu Ning’s way towards the 7th floor. When Gu Ning walked in the passage of the 7th floor, the door of a VIP ward was suddenly pushed open and an old woman in a patient suit ran outside in a panic. Although the woman was very old, she still ran without caring about anything around her and almost hit Gu Ning.

Gu Ning stopped and looked at her, and the old woman immediately begged Gu Ning for help. “Help me, please. Someone wants to kill me.”

The old woman looked into the ward with fright, which implied that the person who wanted to kill her was in it. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Hearing that, Gu Ning frowned and wasn’t sure whether it was true or not. The next second, a younger woman about 30 years old ran outside in panic as well.

The old woman hid herself behind Gu Ning the moment she saw the younger woman and looked frightened. Although Gu Ning didn’t understand what was happening, she felt that she should protect the old woman at this moment. In addition, she could feel that the old woman’s fear was real.

A guilty look flashed in the younger woman’s eyes, but Gu Ning still caught it.

“Miss, I’m sorry, my mother is mentally ill, she doesn’t know what she’s doing now,” she explained to Gu Ning and took her as a nurse in this hospital.

Saying that, she went to pull the old woman. “Mom, no one wants to kill you.”

“No, no, stay away from me!” The old woman clenched Gu Ning’s arm without delay and refused to go back to the ward with the younger woman.

Gu Ning had to stop the younger woman. “Since your mother is mentally ill, I can have a look.”

She sensed that something was abnormal between the old woman and the younger woman.

“It’s fine. My mother will be fine after resting for a while in the ward,” the younger woman said. She was unwilling to let Gu Ning be involved in it. If Gu Ning was involved, she was afraid that the old woman would say something that she shouldn’t say.

“I’m a nurse, and it’s part of my job to take care of the patients. We can go to the ward together,” Gu Ning said. She was sure that the younger woman wasn’t a good person.

The younger woman couldn’t reject it now, because it would raise suspicion. What she didn’t know was that Gu Ning wasn’t a nurse at all.

“Fine.” The younger woman agreed in the end. She had bad luck today.

“Let’s go inside together now,” Gu Ning gently said to the old woman.

“No, no, no.” The old woman quickly shook her head. If Gu Ning left later, she would still be in danger.

“Relax, I’ll stay by your side,” Gu Ning said to comfort her. The old woman was struck dumb for a second, then chose to believe Gu Ning.

Afterwards, the three of them walked into the ward and the younger woman closed the door at once. However, the moment the younger woman did that, Gu Ning hit the back of her neck knocking her unconscious.

“What?” The old woman was scared by Gu Ning’s sudden movement.

At the same time, she felt relieved when the younger woman passed out.

“Ma’am, I believe you, so I just knocked her unconscious. Can you trust me too?” Gu Ning asked the old woman in a serious tone.

“Sure, sure.” The old woman nodded.

After that, Gu Ning moved the younger woman to the other bed in the ward, then walked back to the old woman. “Ma’am, what happened?”

The old woman was more trustworthy in Gu Ning’s eyes, so she wanted to hear the truth from her mouth. However, if this old woman had done something unacceptable before, Gu Ning wouldn’t help her.

The younger woman called this old woman her mother, so the younger woman could be this old woman’s daughter or daughter-in-law. They were close family members, so something terrible must have happened.

The old woman burst into tears all of a sudden.

“She’s my daughter, but my adopted daughter. Her name is Xiang Yili. She is the biological daughter of one of my distant relatives. Her parents passed away in a car accident when she was 10, and she had nowhere to go. My family was richer and I didn’t have any children, so I adopted her and raised her up as my own kid.”

“About 10 years ago, my husband died of cancer, and I had to manage my family’s business alone. My brother-in-law’s family helps me sometimes, but I’m suffering from kidney failure now and I need to step down from my position. I plan to give my brother-in-law my shares and let him take over my family business, while my adopted daughter can have 10% shares.”

“My adopted daughter, however, is unwilling to accept it, she believes that she should take over my family’s business. She wants to murder me before I settle the will, but she doesn’t know that my will is already settled and she won’t get the wealth that doesn’t belong to her even if I’m dead.”
