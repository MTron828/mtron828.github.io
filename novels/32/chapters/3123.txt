3126 One Third of the Money as Remuneration

Pei Heran told his friends what Leng Xiaoyao had achieved and his friends were shocked.

Although they didn’t know whether Leng Xiaoyao could gamble, they decided to try it. Perhaps she was good at it!

In that case, she could do them a favor.

Leng Xiaoyao was having her evening class, but she saw the message as soon as she received it.

She had just explained the questions to her classmates and they needed time to digest it, so she was free at the moment. Without delay, she read the message.

Ling Tianqi: Xiaoyao, do you gamble, Sic Bo? I ran into Qin Wentao at Fengyun Casino. He challenged me to play Sic Bo. Each side can have three people and each person should prepare chips worth ten million yuan. I didn’t want to be a coward, so I agreed. The game will begin at 10 pm. I know you’re skilled, so I wonder whether you can gamble. If you can, please help me. If not, then forget it.

Reading the message, Leng Xiaoyao understood that Qin Wentao challenged Ling Tianqi with a purpose, so Ling Tianqi would probably lose if she didn’t help him.

She had nothing to do right now, so she said yes.

Ling Tianqi received a reply right after sending Leng Xiaoyao the message. When he saw that Leng Xiaoyao agreed to help, he felt very relieved.

He believed that Leng Xiaoyao had the confidence since she agreed to help.

Pei Heran and Feng Rui were also relieved when they heard the result. Afterwards, they went to enjoy themselves first.

Qin Wentao glanced at Ling Tianqi once in a while, but he didn’t know that Ling Tianqi turned to someone else for help. He was sure that they were going to lose.

Leng Xiaoyao took a taxi to Fengyun Casino right after finishing her evening class. When she walked out of school, she called Leng Changyuan and Uncle Liu, telling them that she needed to help a friend with an emergency.

Leng Changyuan didn’t ask further about that and only told Leng Xiaoyao to be careful.

Leng Xiaoyao had simple make-up products in her bag, so she put on light make-up at the washroom first after she arrived at the casino. She didn’t want people to see her real face.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t dress casually today. She had a pair of tight pants, 5 cm high heels, and a white drawstring v-neck top.

If she didn’t tighten the string, she looked elegant, but she became sexy once the string was tightened. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Therefore, with the make-up and tightened string, Leng Xiaoyao showed a little waist and looked slightly maturer. No one would notice that she was a senior high school student.

Because Ling Tianqi had seen Leng Xiaoyao with make-up, he recognized her once she showed up.

Even though they knew that Leng Xiaoyao would come, they were still excited to see her.

When Leng Xiaoyao came, it was still five minutes away from 10 pm, so they didn’t meet Qin Wentao yet.

“Hi, Xiaoyao, thank you so much for coming!” Ling Tianqi said.

Ling Tianqi’s two friends were amazed the moment they saw Leng Xiaoyao. To their surprise, Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t only skilled, she was beautiful as well.

“No need to say that. After all, I won’t help you for free. I need one third of the money as remuneration after we win later,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

She was willing to help him, but there was a price for it. However, if they didn’t win, she wouldn’t ask for anything.

“Of course,” Ling Tianqi said. He didn’t have the idea of asking Leng Xiaoyao for help without giving her anything. If so, he would be too embarrassed to turn to her for help.

Even if he needed to pay Leng Xiaoyao, he could still make money if they won.

“Xiaoyao, how much do you know about Sic Bo?” asked Pei Heran. He believed Leng Xiaoyao since she agreed to help, but he still wanted to know her ability.

“I won twenty million yuan not long ago in this casino,” Leng Xiaoyao said. She didn’t keep it a secret, because it was known to many people. People who often came here must have already heard of it, though only a few people had seen her.

Even if they met her again, they might not be able to recognize her.

Leng Xiaoyao came here twice with make-up, but she put on much lighter make-up this time, so she looked differently.

Besides, they saw so many people every day. It was hard for them to remember a face.

“What?”

Everyone was surprised. She just won twenty million yuan? That was amazing!

“H-How did you leave then?” asked Feng Rui. They all knew it wasn’t easy to leave a casino with a lot of money.

“Because I have a relationship with the manager here, he let me go, but he asked me not to come here often, otherwise they can’t make money. So I haven’t come here for a long time,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

Leng Xiaoyao had a relationship with the manager of Fengyun Casino? They were surprised again. It seemed that Leng Xiaoyao had a relationship with many important people.

However, that was reasonable. Leng Xiaoyao was so skilled that she ought to have a relationship with powerful people.

“If so, I’m sure we are going to win today,” Pei Heran said excitedly. He now had no worries.

Ling Tianqi’s two friends were stunned by Leng Xiaoyao. In their eyes, she was like a god not a human being.

After Leng Xiaoyao chatted with Ling Tianqi for a while, Qin Wentao came over, so Ling Tianqi didn’t have time to introduce his friends to Leng Xiaoyao.

Because Qin Wentao saw Leng Xiaoyao with freckles last time, he didn’t know that this beautiful girl was also her. As a result, he didn’t pay much attention to her.

However, when he and his friends saw Leng Xiaoyao, they were surprised by her beauty.

“Mr. Ling, it’s about 10 pm. Shouldn’t we go get chips and meet in the private room?” Qin Wentao said confidently. He learned nothing from the lesson he had gotten last time.

Qin Wentao was always prepared when he challenged Ling Tianqi. At least, he believed there was a 70% probability that he would win. In addition, he didn’t think Ling Tianqi could be so lucky and get help every time.

“Sure,” Ling Tianqi agreed. Before he called Leng Xiaoyao, he was really worried, but now he believed he would win with her help.
