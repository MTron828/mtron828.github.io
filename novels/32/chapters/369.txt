Chapter 370 I Miss You So Much

Once she was free, Gu Ning couldn’t help thinking of Leng Shaoting. What is he doing now? She thought to herself. The minute she thought about that, her phone rang, and the caller was precisely Leng Shaoting.

“Ningning!” Leng Shaoting greeted her and sounded like he hadn’t seen her in ages. He had stayed in the military base these past few days and couldn’t call Gu Ning or even open his phone to see photos of her, which tortured him.

Hearing Leng Shaoting’s voice, Gu Ning’s heart skipped a beat.

“Shaoting!” Gu Ning missed him too. It was normal if they hadn’t seen each other for a few days, but it worried her that she hadn’t heard from him at all.

“I miss you so much,” Leng Shaoting said.

Gu Ning’s heart beat faster. “I miss you too!”

They didn’t end the call until they had spoken for two hours.

The next day, Gu Man and Gu Qing didn’t go to the beauty salon, they instead went to shop with Gu Ning along with Gao Yi and Qiao Ya.

There were only five seats in the car, so it could only accommodate five people. Thus Jiang Xinyue stayed at home.

When the Gu Ning, Gu Man and Gu Qing appeared, Gao Yi and Qiao Ya immediately got out of the car and open the car doors for them. “Hi, Yi and Ya, this is my mom and this is my aunt,” Gu Ning said to them.

“It’s so nice to meet you!” Gao Yi and Qiao Ya greeted Gu Man and Gu Qing with great respect.

“Nice to meet you too!” Gu Man and Gu Qing replied politely.

“Mom, aunt, this is Gao Yi and this is Qiao Ya,” Gu Ning introduced.

“Well, I think that we can just call you Gao and Qiao,” Gu Man said, because Gao Yi and Qiao Ya seemed young.

“Sure,” Gao Yi and Qiao Ya replied.

After that, they got in the car and Gao Yi was the driver. They drove straight to the biggest shopping mall in City F.

The New Year festival was around the corner, so there were many people shopping in the supermarket on the first floor.

In the past, Gu Ning’s family could only afford cheap stuff, but now everything was different. They could buy anything they liked and wanted.

Gu Qing and Gu Man were busy shopping, while Gao Yi and Qiao Ya helped them carry packages along the way. In the beginning, Gu Qing and Gu Man didn’t want to bother Gao Yi and Qiao Ya, but Gu Ning said that Gao Yi and Qiao Ya were both strong enough to help them, so Gu Man and Gu Qing agreed. When it was almost 10 am, Gu Ning received An Qian’s call. The minute that Gu Ning answered her call, An Qian complained, “Gu Ning, you’ve disappeared for so long! Why didn’t you tell me that you’re back! If An Yi didn’t tell me, I probably wouldn’t know about it!”

Although An Qian and Gu Ning seldom contacted each other, their friendship didn’t fall apart.

There were friends who you could always talk to even though you hadn’t heard from them in a long time.

“Alright, it’s my fault. Are you free this morning? Let me buy you a meal.” Gu Ning felt a little guilty and she also thought that it was time to meet with An Qian.

“Of course yes! Even if I wasn’t not free, I would clear my schedule for you!” An Qian said, like she wouldn’t let Gu Ning escape again.

Gu Ning felt like laughing, and asked, “What do you want to have?”

“Let’s go have steak! I strongly recommend a western restaurant to you. I go there a lot,” An Qian said.

“No problem. When shall we meet?” Gu Ning asked.

“Twelve,” An Qian said.

When the New Year festival came, thieves and robbers gathered too. Right as Gu Ning and the others left the supermarket, they heard a horrified scream. “A robber!” They looked towards the voice and saw a young man running ahead with a handbag. A woman was chasing behind him, but she was wearing high-heels and it was impossible for her to catch up to the robber.

Gu Ning recognized the woman, and there was a little grudge between them too. The woman was Qin Yiqing, Qin Yifan’s older sister.

Although Gu Ning disliked her, Gu Ning wasn’t a hater, nor a mean person, so she said to Gao Yi, “Gao Yi, stop him.”

“Yes, madam,” Gao Yi replied. He put the bags in his hands down on the ground and stretched out his leg when the robber ran by his side. The robber stumbled and fell heavily. Gao Yi then instantly got control of him and grabbed the handbag back.

Everyone around was amazed by the scene and looked at Gao Yi with admiration.

Qin Yiqing ran up to them and Gao Yi gave the handbag back to her. “Thank you so much, sir!” Qin Yiqing said.

Qin Yiqing was proud and snobbish, but she had good manners. After that, Qin Yiqing noticed Gu Ning and was surprised as well as embarrassed, because she thought of what she had said in front of Gu Ning previously. Qin Yiqing had mixed emotions. Although she knew that it was her fault, she was reluctant to apologize.

Gu Ning didn’t care. She turned around, walking away with Gu Man. Qin Yiqing also felt relieved. The robber was released because he didn’t cause any damage.

Gu Man and Gu Qing continued shopping afterwards.

They went to buy wine and cigarettes later. The cigarettes were for Jiang Xu and the wines were for the meals.

Gu Qing chose cigarettes according to Jiang Xu’s preference. And the best red wine in this store was 85′ Lafite, which cost twelve thousand yuan a bottle, and only three bottles were left in the store.

Gu Qing and Gu Man thought that it was too expensive.

“Ningning, it’s too expensive!”

“Indeed!” Gu Qing and Gu Man were both amazed by the price.

However, the moment they said that, a female voice sounded behind them. “It’s 85′ Lafite! If you can’t afford it, don’t walk inside then.”

“Exactly!” another female voice echoed with disdain.

People around them heard it and all turned to look. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Seeing the newcomers, Gu Man frowned. Obviously, she didn’t like them.
