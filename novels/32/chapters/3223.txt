3225 His Heart Skipped a Beat

“Hi, Brother Mochen!” Leng Xiaoyao greeted him. Before he invited her, she directly opened the car door and got inside quickly.

The car doors were usually locked, but Li Mochen told Mu Yuan to unlock the door when he asked him to stop the car.

Seeing Leng Xiaoyao’s excited face, Li Mochen somehow felt pleased. Even his voice became gentler. “What are you doing here?”

Even though Mu Yuan and Meng Fan knew that Li Mochen had a different attitude towards Leng Xiaoyao, they were still startled by his gentle voice.

They had never seen Li Mochen being so gentle before.

“Our head teacher was in a car accident. He was injured, so I came to see him,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Oh!” Li Mochen answered. He didn’t care about that. “Have you eaten yet?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Not yet! I’m starving. Brother Mochen, why don’t you buy me a meal?” asked Leng Xiaoyao. She didn’t really lack a free meal, but she wanted to eat with him.

“No problem, what do you want to eat?” asked Li Mochen.

“Just drive and we can have whatever we see,” Leng Xiaoyao suggested. She wasn’t a picky eater.

“Sure.” Li Mochen replied and told Mu Yuan to drive slowly, so they could see what they wanted to eat.

“Brother Mochen, when did you come back?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“I passed by and saw you,” Li Mochen said.

“It seems that we’re destined to meet!” Leng Xiaoyao said.

They were destined to meet?

Li Mochen’s heart skipped a beat.

Before long, they saw a private, home cuisine restaurant which seemed good, so they chose it. Only Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao went to eat. Mu Yuan and Meng Fan didn’t follow them.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t mind and Li Mochen allowed them to go with him, but they were smart and decided not to follow.

Although Li Mochen allowed them to go with him, he was satisfied with them being sensible.

Li Mochen asked Leng Xiaoyao to order, so Leng Xiaoyao ordered several dishes, but they were Li Mochen’s frequent choices.

“I don’t know. If there is nothing else to deal with, it’s no difference where I stay. If there is something to deal with, I’ll go,” Li Mochen said.

In the past, he mostly stayed in the capital city, but now he often went to City Chang.

He understood that it had something to do with Leng Xiaoyao, but he was unwilling to face it. He deliberately ignored his special feelings for Leng Xiaoyao.

“Does that mean you’re free when you’re in City Chang?” asked Leng Xiaoyao.

“Yes.” Li Mochen answered.

“If so, why don’t we go to the circuit and compete again after eating?” Leng Xiaoyao suggested. She hadn’t raced a car for a long time, and wanted to do it today. She got excited after Li Mochen showed up since she rarely met a match.

“Don’t you need to go to school? It’s Friday today,” asked Li Mochen. Although Leng Xiaoyao was an excellent student, he felt that he might get Leng Xiaoyao into a bad habit if she always went to have fun with him.

“Given my scores, it doesn’t matter whether I go to school or not,” Leng Xiaoyao said.

“Great.” If so, Li Mochen said nothing else. He subconsciously didn’t want to disappoint Leng Xiaoyao.

After having the meal, they went to the circuit.

Coincidentally, Leng Xiaoyao saw Chu Jianan at the circuit. Jiang Yihan was with him. Once Leng Xiaoyao saw them, she had a big smile.

They were really bold and dared to go out together during the day!

When Leng Xiaoyao saw them, they noticed her too. Both of them were embarrassed.

Luckily, they weren’t alone. There were two women and three men with them, so they weren’t afraid that Leng Xiaoyao might be suspicious of them.

All of them had attended the Mo family’s birthday party, so they recognized Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen.

They were aware that Leng Xiaoyao had a relationship with Li Mochen, but they didn’t expect them to be close enough to hang out together.

They didn’t know Li Mochen’s background, but he must have a high status given Master Mo’s attitude towards him.

Therefore, they stood in awe of Li Mochen.

Chu Jianan especially felt that Li Mochen was looking at him all the time, so he was under a lot of pressure.

He understood that Li Mochen was staring at him due to Leng Xiaoyao, but because of that, he was even more upset.

Leng Xiaoyao became outstanding and Li Mochen who was also outstanding was by her side. They were like a perfect couple.

Chu Jianan didn’t want to admit it, but it was the truth.

Li Mochen focused on Chu Jianan for a long while, so Leng Xiaoyao noticed it. She gave him a glance, and Li Mochen immediately withdrew his gaze. It seemed as if he was caught doing something bad by Leng Xiaoyao.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t think it was an issue. She was just curious about why Li Mochen disliked Chu Jianan.

Leng Xiaoyao didn’t avoid Chu Jianan and the others. Instead, she wanted to watch a drama, so she walked to them and said meaningfully, “Oh, is Leng Yuqi absent?”

“Yuqi is in class.” Jiang Yihan replied subconsciously.

“She’s in class… Well, one of you is Leng Yuqi’s boyfriend, while the other is her best friend. Why would you hang out without her? That’s really strange.” Leng Xiaoyao seemed confused.

Was she confused? No, she had solid evidence of their affair!

“Don’t be ridiculous! We came here with our own friends. Don’t spread rumors.” Chu Jianan snapped at Leng Xiaoyao. He reacted immediately, not because he cared about Leng Yuqi. If he did, he wouldn’t have a sexual relationship with Jiang Yihan. He simply didn’t want anyone to know about their relationship. In fact, no one knew about it yet.

In his eyes, Jiang Yihan was only a secret lover.

“Really?” Leng Xiaoyao gave him a meaningful smile as if she saw through him.

Both Chu Jianan and Jiang Yihan were scared, but they didn’t think that Leng Xiaoyao really knew something.

Leng Xiaoyao stopped talking with them, then called Li Mochen and walked away.

“Miss Leng, is there anything wrong with them?” asked Mu Yuan curiously.

“Yes, Chu Jianan and Jiang Yihan have slept together behind Leng Yuqi’s back, but their relationship can’t be made public. I wonder how Leng Yuqi would feel when she finds out that her best friend stole her boyfriend right after she stole the man away from me,” Leng Xiaoyao said excitedly. She bet that it would be dramatic once Leng Yuqi found out.
