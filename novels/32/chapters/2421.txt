Chapter 2424: Yes, Me

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Great, if so, I think I should totally destroy your organization first.” Gu Ning sneered. Since they admitted it, there was no reason for her to doubt that.

“You?” The man showed obvious disdain. He knew that Gu Ning was very strong, but it was impossible for her to destroy their organization alone!

“Yes, me,” said Gu Ning confidently. As a cultivator, with the help of the monster fox and the humanoid tree vine, it shouldn’t be difficult for her to destroy a killer organization.

If she couldn’t do it alone, Jiang Liluo and Si Jin could help her, making it very easy.

“Funny!”

They refused to believe it. If there were ten people of Gu Ning’s level, they might lose.

However, although Gu Ning could easily injure them and they had to admit that Gu Ning was strong, they thought that she was only able to do it because they weren’t prepared. If Gu Ning attacked them when they were prepared, she wouldn’t have succeeded so easily.

It was true that Gu Ning succeeded in beating them because they weren’t prepared, but it was her skill that allowed her to approach them without them noticing her. And she was able to beat them with a single movement even though they realized what was happening later. Therefore, it was clear that there was a huge gap between their abilities, but those men refused to admit it.

At this time, Gao Yi arrived. He wasn’t relieved until he saw that Qiao Ya was fine, but he still asked worriedly, “Are you alright?”

Gao Yi didn’t know that Qiao Ya was shot, because Gu Ning didn’t want to distract him while he was driving. If he was distracted, he might have had a car accident, so she didn’t tell him.

Even though Gao Yi was unaware of that, he knew that she must be injured because although she was very strong she was still caught by those men.

Qiao Ya would be fine after Gu Ning came, but Qiao Ya was his girl. Whether she was injured or not, he was worried about her.

“I’m fine,” said Qiao Ya with a smile.

After making sure of it, Gao Yi was completely relieved. Then he turned to look at those men with a cold face, but he couldn’t do anything illegal since Gu Ning was here.

“What do you think? What should we do now?” Gu Ning asked Gao Yi and Qiao Ya.

“Miss, if you don’t want to kill, why don’t we disable them. They’ll lose their skills,” said Gao Yi, filled with anticipation.

He used to be a professional killer, so killing was his job. He didn’t feel guilty when people died in front of him. However, after he started working for Gu Ning, he didn’t kill again. Therefore, even if those men tried to kill them, he was still reluctant to deprive them of their lives. Anyway, disabling those men wasn’t exactly a light punishment. Those men would have to live the rest of their lives in pain.

Anyway, he and Qiao Ya were fine now.

“No!” Once the three men heard that Gao Yi wanted to disable them, they shouted angrily.

“If you dare do that to us, our head will get revenge,” one of them said.

“I know, but he won’t do it for you. Don’t forget that we’ve served the same organization. If you fail to finish your task, you’ll only be abandoned,” said Qiao Ya mockingly.

“…”

All of a sudden, the three men didn’t know what to say.

It was true that they would only be abandoned if they failed to finish their task. Their head would pay Gao Yi and Qiao Ya back simply because he wanted to draw Gu Ning over to his side instead of taking revenge for them.

As a result, they wouldn’t survive whether Gu Ning killed them or let them go.

“Great, then we’ll disable them.” Gu Ning agreed. “I’ll make arrangements and then we can go destroy the organization you worked for before. How dare they target me? I’ll teach them to stay away from me!”

Hearing Gu Ning’s words, Gao Yi was a little confused, because he didn’t know that the head of the killer organization was actually targeting Gu Ning, but it wasn’t the right time to ask about it now. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Go back to the car. Leave them to me,” said Gu Ning. She told Gao Yi and Qiao Ya to leave first, because she was going to release cold magical power to freeze and disable their limbs. If Gao Yi and Qiao Ya stayed, they would be affected too.

“Sure.”

Gao Yi and Qiao Ya nodded, then walked out.

At this time, the three men began to panic. They wanted to escape, but they were too seriously injured to get back to their feet, let alone run away.

It was impossible for them to beg Gu Ning for mercy. Their pride wouldn’t allow them to do that.

Anyway, given the current situation, even if they begged Gu Ning for mercy, she wouldn’t let them go.

Gu Ning didn’t rush to take action, but only stared at them. When Gao Yi and Qiao Ya had walked far away, she released cold magical power to attack them.

Instantly, the three of them felt cold, but they thought it was a cold wind blowing in.

However, they soon felt their bodies become stiff and sore. So they immediately realized that something wasn’t right.

What was going on here? They didn’t see Gu Ning do anything to them!

Looking at the vague smile on Gu Ning’s face, they felt it was caused by her, but she had just stood there.

“What did you do to us?” one of them asked. Although Gu Ning did nothing except stand there, he knew it must have something to do with her.

“Do your bodies feel stiff and painful? Have you noticed that you can barely speak now?” Gu Ning asked with a faint smile.

“You…”

The three men were scared. Since Gu Ning mentioned that, it must have been done by her.

“What exactly did you do?” the man asked again. He now believed that it was caused by Gu Ning.

“Do you think it’s really strange? I didn’t move at all, but your bodies have been affected.” Gu Ning laughed. “So, given my abilities, you can hardly harm me. And I meant it when I said that I’m going to destrpy your organization. Believe it or not, it’s not difficult for me.”

The three men were convinced. She did nothing, but they were already losing strength. If she could do that to them, she could do it to other people as well.

It was so creepy! Was she even a human? Was she a monster or ghost?
