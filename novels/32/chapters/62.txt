Chapter 63: I Want You

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Li Zhenzhen was in a rage now. She hated Gu Ning to the death. Now Qin Yifan even wanted to invite Gu Ning to have lunch together. Li Zhenzhen almost went crazy.

“If you don’t want Yifan to hate you, mind your behavior. We can deal with Gu Ning secretly,” Li Zhenyu warned.

He wanted Li Zhenzhen to be with Qin Yifan, because it would be helpful to the Li Family.

Thus he naturally disliked Gu Ning, who had grabbed Qin Yifan’s attention and defeated Li Zhenzhen.

Or more technically, he hated Gu Ning because of the ten million yuan.

Ten million yuan wasn’t much to his family, but could be used to do many things. He would be lying if he said he didn’t care.

Li Zhenzhen was a little surprised, but also felt happy.

True! If she wanted to deal with Gu Ning, she could do it secretly.

City G was the domain of Li Zhenzhen. She had plenty of ways to deal with Gu Ning.

Besides, she knew some gangsters. It was easy to hurt Gu Ning in Li Zhenzhen’s eyes.

Thinking of this, Li Zhenzhen felt comfortable and relaxed.

“No, thanks. I have something else to deal with. Thank you,” Gu Ning rejected Qin Yifan’s invitation.

“Fine.” Qin Yifan didn’t insist. He asked later, “Will you be here later?”

“No, I won’t come again,” Gu Ning said. All the great jade was in her hands now. There weren’t many left in the shop after all.

She had used her Jade Eyes to earn a fortune. It would be too selfish if she collected all the valuable jade in the shops.

Qin Yifan had to give up at the end. He only reminded Gu Ning to turn to him if she had any trouble.

“Miss Gu, let’s go transfer the money.” Zhou Zhenghong stayed by Gu Ning’s side all the time. Knowing she was leaving, he asked on his own initiative.

“We don’t need to rush. Uncle Zhou, let’s have lunch together,” Gu Ning said.

“Great.” Zhou Zhenghong didn’t reject. Gu Ning’s money was still in his account after all.

While they were leaving, Zhou Zhenghong helped Gu Ning take her raw materials which hadn’t been cut open.

After Gu Ning and the others were gone, the shop became popular and well-known. Everyone now knew there were two high-level jade that had been cut out in the shop.

When people heard the owner of those two high-level jade was a young girl, everyone was amazed.

Gu Ning didn’t plan to leave the antique market now. Thus she chose a restaurant right in the antique market and booked a private dining room.

“Miss Gu, thank you so much for helping me this time! If it hadn’t been for you, I would have abandoned that raw material. Then I would have lost so much money,” Zhou Zhenghong thanked Gu Ning the minute they sat down.

Gu Ning smiled. She didn’t want to hide her real purpose, so she said straightforwardly, “Uncle Zhou, I don’t want to lie to you. Let me tell you the truth! I helped you for a reason, especially when I found out your identity.”

Hearing that, Zhou Zhenghong was surprised, and puzzled.

She did it for a reason? For what? Why?

Even though she knew his identity, it wouldn’t be of great help. He had lost everything, and was a poor, ordinary man now. What was Gu Ning’s purpose? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Although knowing the young girl had helped him for a reason, Zhou Zhenghong wasn’t mad. He knew Gu Ning wasn’t a bad person.

“Why?” Zhou Zhenghong asked.

“Because I’ll be involved in the jewelry and jade industry, but I am still a student, I can’t do it myself. I need a professional and competent manager. Although I don’t know much about you, you didn’t run away with the money just then. You’re not a malicious man. And from the development of Zhoufu jewelry, your ability is also affirmed. So, after knowing your identity, I want you.”

What?

Zhou Zhenghong rounded his eyes in shock.

He didn’t expect a teenage girl would be so ambitious as to run a company, and had even tested him before choosing him to be the manager.

But, they were merely strangers who had only met each other once! Why would she trust him?

“We just met for the first time. We’re not acquaintances even. Why do you trust me?” Zhou Zhenghong asked.

“Yes, we met for the first time. We’re not acquaintances even. I completely have no reason to believe you, but I am willing to believe you. The employer can’t be suspicious, and the suspect can’t be used. Although I care about my people very much, I never accept betrayal. If one treats me with sincerity, I’ll give him or her a bright future. If one betrays me, he or she will be dead. No way around it.”

Saying the “dead” word, Gu Ning seemed murderous. Zhou Zhenghong was stunned, as if he was surrounded by the feeling of death. He held his breath.

Zhou Zhenghong was a sophisticated businessman. He had met a variety of people, and he could judge from Gu Ning’s air that she was a powerful as well as cruel person.

Of course, she was only cruel to her opponents. She cared about her people very much.

Facing Gu Ning’s warning, Zhou Zhenghong didn’t feel reluctant, instead, he trusted Gu Ning.

As for Zhou Zhenghong, if he chose to follow Gu Ning, he would no betray her. He was an upright and loyal people himself.

“Perhaps, you’re not optimistic about me, and don’t want a young girl to be your boss. Or, you want to be the boss yourself, and restart your business, but, I believe you’re a smart man, who knows clearly about the pros and cons. You need a lot of money and supplies to restart your business. However, let alone your lack of both of them, Shao Ping won’t stand aside and let you start your own business. You probably couldn’t register! Of course, you can avoid Shao Ping and go to other places, but if you don’t have enough funds and supplies, it’ll be very hard for you to develop.”

That was exactly what was on Zhou Zhenghong’s mind. Although he wanted to restart his business, he also clearly knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Even if he avoided Shao Ping, and went to another place, he lacked the money and supplies. He could fail again.

“And I can provide enough money and supplies for you. Probably in your eyes I was just lucky today, but it’s not. I have my own unique skills, so I don’t have to worry about money and supplies. If you’re willing to accept my offer, you can have 20% shares of my jewelry company. You’ll be fully responsible to run the company. To the public, you’re the chairman and have all the rights of the chairman. I’ll be a behind-the-scene boss. You can discuss with me on things you can’t decide.”
