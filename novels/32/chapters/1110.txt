1111 Meet Another “Tang Aining“

Gu Ning had helped him out and he could live a happy life now as an ordinary person.

“Um, don’t you like the food provided by the company?” Gu Ning noticed the lunchbox in Ba Tianyang’s hands.

Gu Ning wasn’t questioning Ba Tianyang, but simply wanted to know why Ba Tianyang brought a lunchbox himself. If the food wasn’t good here, she would improve it.

Although different people had different tastes for food, she still wanted to make it as widely acceptable as possible.

“Oh, no, no.” Ba Tianyang denied it at once, but he looked a little shy and embarrassed the next second. However, in order to not make Gu Ning misunderstand him, Ba Tianyang still said, “Well, Manni, oh, no, Manager Song doesn’t feel comfortable today, so I went to buy some oatmeal for her.”

Ba Tianyang stammered a little because he was very nervous, which looked totally different from his identity as a killer.

He had been trained as a professional killer in a killer organisation ever since he was a little kid, and he wasn’t allowed to have emotions. As a result, he knew nothing about romantic relationships.

Seeing that, Gu Ning realized that Ba Tianyang fell in love with Song Manni.

He called her Manni!

Actually, Ba Tianyang was a good-looking, mature man, and because he often exercised, he had a muscular build.

Gu Ning was amused by Ba Tianyang’s reaction, and laughed a little. She wondered how Song Manni felt about Ba Tianyang. She was also curious to know whether Ba Tianyang was aware that Song Manni had a divorce before. Would he accept it?

Anyway, if he really loved her, he wouldn’t mind.

Although Song Manni had a divorce before, she didn’t have any kids, and she was still a very beautiful woman. It was easy for her to find a quality man. It would probably be a little difficult for her to trust a man again, but she wasn’t a weak woman and she had confidence in her life.

If Ba Tianyang and Song Manni liked each other, Gu Ning would give them her best wishes.

If Song Manni simply treated Ba Tianyang as a friend, Gu Ning hoped that they could still get along well with each other.

“Wow, great, see you then,” Gu Ning said with a smile.

“See you,” Ba Tianyang said and left.

...

Gu Ning got in her car, but didn’t start it right away. She spent some time on her make-up and disguised herself as “Tang Aining”.

Afterwards, Gu Ning drove away. She needed to be like “Tang Aining”, so she was wearing high-heels now.

When her make-up and clothes were done, she changed her car to a rented car and parked her car at a nearby parking lot. She was driving Leng Shaoting’s car now, and she didn’t want to cause him any trouble.

She couldn’t drive a car under the name of her company either. If anyone found that “Tang Aining” had a relationship with the Shengning Organization, it would cause trouble.

Without further ado, Gu Ning headed straight to the appointed place.

About 1:30 pm, Gu Ning arrived, and she used her Jade Eyes to see the inside of the No.67 house.

There were eight people in it.

A tall strong man in a black suit was standing at its door with a gun by his waist.

Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin were sitting on the sofa. They were chatting and drinking tea, but Gu Ning couldn’t hear what they were talking about.

In fact, Qi Ziyue didn’t want Tang Yaxin to be involved in this, but she insisted.

On the second floor, a woman who was supposed to be “Tang Aining” was lying on the bed in the master’s room. Half of her face was wrapped in bandages, and she indeed resembled Tang Aining.

There were bandages around her body too, and it seemed she was really seriously injured, but Gu Ning knew that it wasn’t true.

In the guest room next to the master’s room, four men in black clothing sat in silence, and they also had guns with them.

Gu Ning sneered. It was obvious that Qi Ziyue planned to force her to give him the USB flash disk.

She remembered what she had been through in the previous incarnation. Tang Yaxin had done the same thing to her before her death.

Thinking of that, Gu Ning was mad. She ached to kill them all right now. Nevertheless, it was illegal, so she had to tolerate it.

When it was about 10 minutes to 2 pm, Gu Ning stopped the rented car outside house No.67.

The tall man standing at the door immediately walked towards her. He also glanced around to see whether there were other people or cars.

“Hi, may I know whether you’re Miss Tang?” he asked when Gu Ning got out of the car.

“Yeah,” Gu Ning said, and closed the car door.

“Please, this way.” The man made a hand gesture to invite Gu Ning to go inside.

Gu Ning followed him, and went to meet Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Welcome, Miss Tang!” Qi Ziyue stood up at once.

Tang Yaxin didn’t greet Gu Ning, but she seemed to be in a good mood, because she believed that this “Tang Aining” would soon be caught by them.
