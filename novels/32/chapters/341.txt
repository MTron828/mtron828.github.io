Chapter 342 Are You Insane?

Everyone around them drew a long breath in after they heard the price. It was a fortune! They were all envious of Gu Ning now. Even Chen Darong couldn’t believe his ears. After this deal was settled, they would indeed reach the all-time record for profits within a day! Chen Darong now thought highly of his new boss, who was able to strike big deals continuously.

“Well, it’s my honor that Master Jiang came to my store today. I think that you can just pay me forty million yuan for these two bronze antiques,” Gu Ning said to Master Jiang.

What? Forty million yuan? That was directly ten million yuan off! Everyone was shocked by her generosity.

“What did you say?” Jiang Zhongyu couldn’t believe it.

“Forty million yuan,” Gu Ning said affirmatively.

“Are you insane?” Jiang Zhongyu blurted out. He didn’t mean to humiliate Gu Ning, but just couldn’t believe it. Businessmen always wanted to earn as much as possible, but Gu Ning was being so generous! Ten million yuan was a lot!

Gu Ning felt like laughing, but she knew that what she had done was truly unbelievable, so she explained with patience, “Master Jiang, I’m not insane. You can just pay me forty million yuan. And let me be honest with you, I am already making a fortune from the deal.”

Seeing Gu Ning being so certain, Jiang Zhongyu didn’t hesitate any more. In addition, forty million yuan wasn’t a low price after all. She could make a lot of money, while he could save a lot of money, which was a win-win.

“Great, I owe you then. No matter what kind of trouble you encounter in this antique street, feel free to ask me for help,” Jiang Zhongyu said to Gu Ning. He really liked Gu Ning’s personality and generosity, so he would love to help her. After that, he took out his name card and gave it to Gu Ning, “This is my name card.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone was jealous of Gu Ning now. With Master Jiang’s support, nobody would dare to cause Xiangyun Antique-store trouble anymore.

“Thank you so much!” Gu Ning of course wouldn’t reject.

However, when she saw the name on the card, she was astonished. To her surprise, this Master Jiang was precisely Jiang Zhongyu who was Leng Shaoting’s grandpa’s old friend. It seemed that they were meant to meet each other! Leng Shaoting had told her that he planned to invite Jiang Zhongyu to visit Xiangyun Antique-store someday. Unexpectedly, Master Jiang came here today, on his own. That also explained why so many people followed him in coming to Xiangyun Antique-store. He was an important figure in the antique industry! Master Jiang indeed was influential.

In the following minutes, they went to sign a contract and transfer the money. Because the amount of money of this transaction was relatively large, they couldn’t swipe a card, and could only transfer the money. When they had finished all of this, Gu Ning walked Master Xu and Master Jiang to the door. Before they left, Master Jiang said to Gu Ning, “Miss, I have an old friend who loves paintings and calligraphy very much. If you have any famous paintings or calligraphy, would you mind telling me?”

Hearing that, Gu Ning immediately realized that Jiang Zhongyu’s old friend had to be Leng Shaoting’s grandpa, Leng Weihua.

“Sure, I will,” Gu Ning smiled.

Afterwards, Master Xu and Jiang Zhongyu walked away happily.

“Xu, let’s go visit Leng now! You’ve been to Hainan for months, and we haven’t gathered together for so long!” Jiang Zhongyu said, like he really missed their gathering, but actually he just wanted to show off.

“Stop acting! I know what’s in your mind. You simply want to show off in front of Leng.” Master Xu rolled his eyes and hit the point without hesitation. They had been old friends for dozens of years, and they couldn’t hide secrets from one another. However, they indeed hadn’t gathered together in a long time, and they would love to meet and chat with one another.

“Ha-ha!” Jiang Zhongyu didn’t feel embarrassed at all. “He showed off in front of me the other day! Why can’t I do the same thing? I’m so envious that he got Zhao Mengfu’s Luo Shen Fu.”

Although Jiang Zhongyu had a preference for bronze, he also liked other collectibles, especially Zhao Mengfu’s Luo Shen Fu. He would definitely buy it if he saw it. Leng Weihua preferred paintings and calligraphy, and Master Xu liked porcelain, but both of them wouldn’t miss any collectibles.

“Ha-ha, ha-ha!” Master Xu was amused. Jiang Zhongyu and

Leng Weihua were like little kids.

Master Xu was also aware of the Luo Shen Fu because Leng Weihua had purposely called him that night. Master Xu was also envious of him, but he wasn’t as excited as Jiang Zhongyu and Leng Weihua.

After Master Xu and Jiang Zhongyu left, Gu Ning talked with Chen Darong in a room.

Gu Ning said, “The New Year festival is around the corner. Both of the salesmen can have year-end bonus of a hundred thousand yuan, and yours is two hundred thousand yuan.”

Hearing that, Chen Darong rounded his eyes in shock. Normally, they only had a year-end bonus of ten or twenty thousand yuan, which was quite a lot to them.

“Uncle Chen, as long as you’re loyal to me, I promise that you’ll get a reasonable bonus.” Gu Ning took out a contract handing to Chen Darong. “This is the new contract that we need to sign together.”

Chen Darong took the new contract and read it with full attention. When he found out that he was able to have 10% shares of Xiangyun Antique-store, he was so shocked that the contract almost fell from his hands.

“Boss, 1...” Chen Darong breathed fast now, like he had won the lottery.

“Right, I understand that you are probably amazed, but I’m only a student now, so I need you to manage this store well. Don’t ever think that you don’t deserve it, because all my managers share the same treatment,” Gu Ning said seriously. “However, if you betray me, you can’t bear the result.”

Chen Darong didn’t expect that Gu Ning, who was just a young girl could be so powerful and he indeed felt threatened. Since Gu Ning said that all of her managers shared the same treatment, Chen Darong agreed in the end.
