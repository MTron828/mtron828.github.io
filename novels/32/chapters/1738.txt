Chapter 1740: Go to the Cultivation World

After hanging up the phone, Tang Qingyang soon sent her the contract, and Gu Ning printed it out at once. In case Tang Bingsen ruined it, she prepared several pieces.

When Gu Ning was still in the company at 4 pm, Leng Shaoting called her. They were leaving for the siheyuan, so Gu Ning set off too.

In the morning, Leng Shaoting already told Shangguan Yang that they would come to see him later.

Shangguan Yang heard that Leng Shaoting’s mother was a cultivator earlier on. Because Leng Shaoting was a cultivator himself, it wasn’t surprising that one of his parents was a cultivator too. Leng Shaoting also told Shangguan Yang his story.

He didn’t tell Shangguan Yang everything. For example, the truth of Jing Yunyao’s falling from the cliff was what Gu Ning saw, so he simply told Shangguan Yang that he didn’t know the reason.

He had said that he doubted whether his father was really dead, and Shangguan Yang was really surprised when Leng Shaoting told him that he was sure that his mother was still alive.

Because neither of them knew that Jing Yunyao could lose her memories, they believed that Leng Shaoting’s mother would have come back to see him if she was still alive.

However, after knowing that Leng Shaoting’s mother lost her memories, Shangguan Yang understood why she had been absent for years.

Shangguan Yang was also curious about the cultivation world, so he was looking forward to meeting Jing Yunyao. He wanted to learn more about it from her mouth, and hoped that she could bring him to have a tour in the cultivation world.

...

Before Gu Ning left her company, she told Chen Cangyi to arrange for someone to send the MPV back to Shengshi Hotel, and she left in a car owned by the company.

Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao set off from the Leng family’s old house, so they arrived later than Gu Ning. So once Gu Ning came, Shangguan Yang kept asking her about Jing Yunyao. However, Gu Ning only told him some unimportant information.

As for things that Gu Ning wasn’t sure she could tell other people, she said she didn’t know about it and told Shangguan Yang to ask Leng Shaoting instead.

For example, she didn’t tell Shangguan Yang that Jing Yunyao had been chased by her own father.

After that, Shangguan Yang asked Gu Ning to practice the kung fu skills he had taught her.

Even though Gu Ning had something to talk about with Shangguan Yang, it wasn’t the right time, because Leng Shaoting would soon arrive, while she had to avoid him when she talked about it with Shangguan Yang. Therefore, Gu Ning had to find another time to talk about it with Shangguan Yang.

About 15 minutes later, Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao came. Before Gu Ning felt them, Shangguan Yang sensed the air around them.

Shangguan Yang was a cultivator at a high level after all, and his senses were able to cover a 200-meter radius. Gu Ning, however, could only sense other cultivators at a middle level within a 20-meter radius. If there was a cultivator at a high level like Jing Yunyao, she wouldn’t be able to sense him or her until he or she was within 10 meters from her.

She could only sense a cultivator at a very high level like Shangguan Yang when he was very close to her.

The higher level a cultivator was at, the better he was at hiding his air, but his air couldn’t be hidden away completely.

When they came, Gu Ning stopped practicing the kung fu skills.

Shangguan Yang didn’t go back to his room, and waited for Jing Yunyao to come to see him. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Cultivators kept the ancient rules, and the juniors had to respectfully greet their seniors when they met, especially before seniors of high social status. However, they were in the mortals’ world now, so there was no need for them to keep the rule. Shangguan Yang just sat in the yard, enjoying his tea, waiting for them to come inside.

Jing Yunyao didn’t sense another cultivator until she entered the siheyuan, and her feeling wasn’t strong either. She knew that Shangguan Yang was stronger than her, so it was very normal that she couldn’t sense his air.

Actually, she was able to sense Shangguan Yang because she was at a high level, and Leng Shaoting couldn’t do that at all. He could only sense the air of a cultivator when he stood next to Shangguan Yang.

As Leng Shaoting and Jing Yunyao approached, Shangguan Yang and Gu Ning turned to look at them.

Neither Gu Ning nor Shangguan Yang said anything at this time.

Because Gu Ning was a junior, it wasn’t appropriate for her to open her mouth at this moment, and Shangguan Yang was senior to all of them, so the juniors should greet him first according to the ancient rules.

Even though they didn’t need to take it very seriously in the mortals’ world, it was necessary for juniors to greet their seniors first.

“Very nice to see you, Master Shangguan.” Jing Yunyao greeted Shangguan Yang with great respect.

“Good afternoon, Master Shangguan.” Leng Shaoting also greeted him with great respect.

“Great, come on in!” Shangguan Yang said to them kindly. He didn’t take them as outsiders. Although it was his first meeting with Jing Yunyao, she was his student’s mother.

After that, they walked in together. Jing Yunyao carried two bags in her hands and handed them to Shangguan Yang after walking into the living room. “Master Shangguan, this is our first meeting so I’ve prepared some gifts for you. Please accept them.”

“You don’t need to do that. We’re not strangers after all,” said Shangguan Yang, but he still took the gifts. They stood for Jing Yunyao’s kindness and he didn’t want to upset her. Actually, he was also happy to receive gifts.

“Have a seat now,” said Shangguan Yang, and they were all seated.

“Yunyao, can you describe what the cultivation world is like?” Shangguan Yang asked Jing Yunyao.

Shangguan Yang was much older and senior to Jing Yunyao, so he took her as a young girl.

Jing Yunyao didn’t think it was something she shouldn’t tell, so she said, “As modern society came into being, there were fewer and fewer cultivators because magical power was harder and harder to find. The heavenly tribulation was more and more difficult, so cultivators gathered together in order to survive. Because there is endless magical power in Qianling Mountain, the cultivation world is set there, but it is only as large as a city with a few thousand people.”

“Oh, I understand,” said Shangguan Yang.

“Can I go to the cultivation world to have a tour?” Shangguan Yang asked with anticipation. He didn’t know much about what Jing Yunyao had been through, so he wasn’t aware of her grudge against her family. In fact, Jing Yunyao was unwilling to enter the cultivation world now.
