Chapter 2872: A Man with Evil Energy

“What?”

Both Junior Mrs. Dai and Dai Xiongyu were surprised. Although they had a feeling that Master Dai might be affected by something evil, they still couldn’t believe that it was true. It sounded too strange!

They didn’t think that what Jing Yunyao said was the truth, but her words were still shocking.

It was scary that Master Dai was affected by evil energy!

“Mrs. Leng, are you kidding?” Junior Mrs. Dai was scared and asked. She hoped it wasn’t true.

“I won’t joke about this, but I’m afraid I can’t tell you any details right now. I need to solve the problem first,” Jing Yunyao said. “Is Master Dai in the study? I need to see him.”

“Let me take you there,” Dai Xiongyu said. Master Dai was talking with a guest in the study, but Dai Xiongyu somehow felt that the guest wasn’t kind. He didn’t care whether they interrupted them.

He cared more about Master Dai’s condition now.

Without delay, Dai Xiongyu led Jing Yunyao to the study.

At that moment, the security guard who chased Jing Yunyao reached the main building, but he was stopped by Junior Mrs. Dai.

Outside the study, Dai Xiongyu knocked at the door. “Grandpa, Mrs. Leng is here.”

The moment he finished, he heard Master Dai’s displeased voice. “What’s she doing here? Didn’t I tell you that the Leng family is forbidden to enter our home?”

Hearing that, Dai Xiongyu turned to look at Jing Yunyao in disappointment. However, Jing Yunyao didn’t care about that at all, she directly kicked the door open.

No one expected her to do that, so everyone was scared by the sudden loud sound.

“H-How dare you!” Master Dai snapped at Jing Yunyao who walked inside.

“Master Dai, can you tell me why we’re not welcome? I thought we were distinguished guests before today,” Jing Yunyao asked meaningfully and gave a glance at the man sitting on the sofa.

It was a middle-aged man who was about forty. He was a foreigner and seemed to be from Country T, but Jing Yunyao wasn’t sure of that.

The man was covered in evil energy, but he wasn’t a monster or a ghost, which meant he was just a mortal who had evil energy.

Jing Yunyao moved her sight to Master Dai and saw something strange at his chest. She couldn’t see what it was, but felt it was evil.

It couldn’t be more obvious that Master Dai was being controlled by this man and that this man must have made Master Dai’s eldest son sick.

The man frowned and sized Jing Yunyao up.

Perhaps he felt that Jing Yunyao was different, but didn’t know why.

The man indeed felt something different from Jing Yunyao and could see that she wasn’t an ordinary person, but he couldn’t see what exactly was special about her.

After all, they were from different countries and were different cultivators. There was also a huge gap between their levels, so it was very normal that he couldn’t tell what she was.

However, he was sure that she had special abilities.

Anyway, he wasn’t frightened, because he couldn’t sense her abilities at all and Jing Yunyao didn’t put pressure on him.

“Yeah, grandpa, what happened to you?” Dai Xiongyu asked with concern. Master Dai was like a total stranger.

“Shut your mouth! It’s none of your business.” Master Dai angrily criticized Dai Xiongyu.

Dai Xiongyu was scared of Master Dai, so he didn’t dare to say anything else after Master Dai snapped at him.

After snapping at Dai Xiongyu, Master Dai turned to stare at Jing Yunyao and coldly said, “This is my business. I don’t need to explain it to you. There is a guest. You should leave.”

“What if I don’t?” Jing Yunyao asked arrogantly.

Master Dai was angry. “If you don’t leave, I can only order the security guards to chase you out.”

“Grandpa!” Dai Xiongyu opened his mouth again. “You can’t do that.”

“I told you to shut up! Didn’t you hear me? Get out now!” Master Dai lost his patience. He always loved Dai Xiongyu, but now he seemed to hate him.

Dai Xiongyu wanted to say something again, but Jing Yunyao interrupted. “Alright, I can handle it.”

Hearing that, Dai Xiongyu closed his mouth.

“Mrs. Leng, what do you want? I think I’ve already told you to get out. Can’t you understand? Is the Leng family as rude as you?” Master Dai said angrily.

Dai Xiongyu was scared and believed that something must be wrong with his grandfather, otherwise his grandfather wouldn’t dare to say something like that!

“Master Dai, did you forget what the Leng family has done for you these days?” asked Jing Yunyao. She knew Master Dai changed because of the effect of the evil energy, but she still wanted to know how serious it was.

Master Dai frowned, but didn’t immediately reply and softened a little.

However, at this time, the middle-aged man coughed and Master Dai became cold again. “So what? I don’t need it now. You should go.”

Jing Yunyao watched the middle-aged man’s behavior and Master Dai’s change. An idea dawned on her. Master Dai might have had a poisonous magic cast on him and the strange thing moving around in his body must be a poisonous worm.

If that was true, Master Dai was in a very dangerous situation.

Before they figured out a solution, only the person who cast the poisonous magic could solve the problem. Therefore, she couldn’t kill the middle-aged man, or Master Dai might die too.

As a result, Jing Yunyao stopped arguing with Master Dai. “Fine, if so, I’ll leave.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

As soon as she finished speaking, Jing Yunyao turned around and walked away, looking furious.

Dai Xiongyu was extremely angered by Mater Dai, but he didn’t dare to say anything, so he could only chase after Jing Yunyao.

“Mrs. Leng, I’m sorry, my grandpa…” Dai Xiongyu wanted to apologize for Master Dai, but Jing Yunyao interrupted before he could finish. “No need to apologize. I know it’s not his intention. He’s under someone’s control. Don’t argue with him. Just leave it to us.”

Hearing that, Dai Xiongyu understood that Jing Yunyao wasn’t mad and that Master Dai was indeed under someone’s control.
