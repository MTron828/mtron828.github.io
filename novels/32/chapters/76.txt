Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Take care then.” Qin Yifan knew that Gu Ning was going back today, so he wasn’t surprised that she was in the airport now. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

After Qin Yifan hung up, Li Zhenyu asked him with a meaningful look, “Your attitude towards the girl Gu Ning is different. Tell me the truth. Do you like her?”

Qin Yifan was struck dumb. He did appreciate Gu Ning, but he didn’t know whether he liked Gu Ning himself.

He just felt happy and relaxed whenever he was with her.

“I have no idea.” Qin Yifan gave a vague answer because he truly didn’t know.

However, his vague answer showed that he might actually like her.

Although Li Zhenyu was disappointed to hear that, he said nothing.

He clearly knew that Qin Yifan treated Li Zhenzhen as his younger sister. He wasn’t willing to marry her, but Li Zhenyu still had hope.

Qin Yifan’s parents liked Li Zhenzhen. They all hoped for Qin Yifan to marry Li Zhenzhen, but they would also respect Qin Yifan’s choice.

Therefore, the Li Family couldn’t urge Qin Yifan to marry Li Zhenzhen for the good of their relationship.

Qin Yifan then immediately called his friend to help Gu Ning.

At the same time, what had happened in the restaurant was aired on TV. People all felt surprised.

However, the news reports didn’t mention Gu Ning.

Although Gu Ning had helped a lot in the gun war, Leng Shaoting was afraid that she would be revenged by other gangsters, so he ordered them to not mention her name.

At 3:15 pm, the plane landed at the airport of City F. Gu Ning checked her phone and saw that she received a message from Qin Yifan.

Qin Yifan told her that he had settled everything. His friend’s name and number were attached to the message. The man was called Wei Zhirui.

Gu Ning sent a message back to thank him.

When Gu Ning walked out of the airport, she called Gu Man. She told her mother she was back, but she planned to take a look at the houses before going back to the hospital.

Gu Ning took a taxi heading straight to Fenghua Luxury Mansion.

On her way, she called Wei Zhirui to politely tell him she was coming and her intention.

Wei Zhirui of course wouldn’t reject such a profitable deal. Besides, Gu Ning was introduced by his good friend so Wei Zhirui naturally showed his passion.

“Nice to meet you. May I ask, are you Miss Gu?”

Once Gu Ning walked into the sales apartment, a man who was around 30 years old came to greet her.

Wei Zhirui already knew that Gu Ning was a beautiful 18-year-old girl; and there wasn’t any other young girls around. He was almost 100% sure that he recognized the right person when Gu Ning stepped in.

Although he knew the buyer was a young girl, he was still greatly surprised when he met Gu Ning in person. The girl was so young, and even wanted to buy two houses!

However, since she was introduced by Qin Yifan, she must be super rich.

Anyway, Wei Zhirui would be polite as long as a customer walked in, no matter if he or she was rich or not. That was the basic qualification of a worker in the service industry.

“I am Gu Ning. You must be Mr. Wei!” Gu Ning answered.

“Yes, I’m Wei Zhirui. Nice to meet you, Miss Gu. Welcome to Fenghua Luxury Mansion,” Wei Zhirui said to Gu Ning.

“Miss Gu, Yifan told me about your requests. However, I think it’s better to introduce the environment of Fenghua Luxury Mansion to you first. Please follow me.”

Wei Zhirui guided Gu Ning to the exhibition hall, and said, “Fenghua Luxury Mansion is the most high-end residential area in City F. The location is very good. It’s close to the downtown, but it’s quiet. There is a medium-sized shopping mall across the road from Fenghua Luxury Mansion. There are also food supermarkets, clothing, furniture and so forth inside. There are also many banks around so it’s very convenient to live here.”

“The facilities, preservation and property service of Fenghua Luxury Mansion are all of high quality. Fenghua Luxury Mansion is planned in the form of a district within a central district. Each district forms a community with between four and eight buildings with independent gates. The residents need a card to get in and an outsider needs to get the guidance or permission of a resident here. Only after the security guard is informed can the outsider come in. Of course, it is possible that someone could secretly follow a resident and get in, but if anyone directly affects you, you can immediately call the security room. The security guard will take him or her out as fast as possible. There are small squares, greenery, swimming pools, leisure bars, gyms and small food supermarkets inside as well.”

“Miss Gu, if you want well-decorated houses, the choices of location and floor are limited, because we only have three floors with well-decorated houses in each building. The floors of each building are different. There are six households on each floor, two with four-bedrooms, two with three-bedrooms and two with two-bedrooms. If you want a three-bedroom house, there are two best choices available. One is in the E zone, and the other is in the G zone. Each zone is a community of four or five buildings. If you come in from the gate and walk at a general speed, it only takes 10 to 20 minutes to arrive. We do however have sightseeing cars around here. If you take the car, it only takes three minutes.”

Wei Zhirui then pointed out the location for Gu Ning. The houses were in the front half of the district, and it was indeed a good position.

“There are five buildings in E zone, and three three-bedroom houses in building E3. However, they aren’t on the same floor. Each house is 120 square meters big. There are also four buildings in G zone with three three-bedroom houses in building G2. Two of them are on the ninth floor and the size is relatively larger. It is 160 square meters big with an indoor garden, three rooms and one living room, one study, one kitchen and three bathrooms. There is a large balcony in the living room. Here is a model of the apartment. Please have a look.”

Saying that, Wei Zhirui guided Gu Ning to the models area.

Before Gu Ning saw the size of the houses, she had already planned to buy one that was 160 square meters. Although she felt it was a little large for her and her mother alone, fortunately, there were two houses on the same floor; it’ll be very lively if the family of Gu Qing also moved in.

Gu Ning was very satisfied with the houses that were 160 square meters, but before she decided she wanted to have a look at its decoration first.

Although Fenghua Luxury Mansion was a high-end district, and its decoration was also of high quality. It was better to have a look in person first.

They took the sightseeing car, and arrived within three minutes.

It could be faster if no one got on and off on the way.

They then took the elevator to the ninth floor. Wei Zhirui opened the door for Gu Ning.

Once they walked in, an indoor garden came into view. There was a shoe cabinet beside the door. A tea table and fish tanks were in the garden. There was however no fish in the fish tank because the house wasn’t occupied.
