Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gu Ning wanted to say something, but Leng Yuanjin opened her mouth first. “Why should I? Can you afford anything here in this store? The bracelet in your hand looks beautiful, but you’ve looked at it for a long time. Why don’t you directly buy it?”

Leng Yuanjin wasn’t mad, instead she challenged the woman.

“Of course I can afford it! Pack it up now.” The woman was annoyed by Leng Yuanjin’s words and fell into the trap set by her. Actually, she was hesitant to buy this bracelet, not because she couldn’t afford it, but because she thought that its price was a little high.

This single bracelet cost her three million yuan. If she bought it, she couldn’t buy many other things she wanted to buy this month. However, she was annoyed by Leng Yuanjin’s words, and was determined to prove her wealth.

After a saleswoman packed the bracelet up for her, she gave Leng Yuanjin a glance of disdain, then went to pay the bill.

Leng Yuanjin, however, wasn’t mad at all, instead she felt proud of herself. “Ningning, what do you think? I just helped you settle a deal.”

Gu Ning snorted with laughter and gave Leng Yuanjin a thumbs-up. “Aunt Yuanjin, you’ve done a great job. I must invite you and Aunt Yin to share a meal together later.” In fact, even if Leng Yuanjin didn’t do that, Gu Ning would still invite them to dine together.

“No need, Shaoting will do that,” Leng Yuanjin said and turned to face Leng Shaoting. “Shaoting, you haven’t invited me to share a meal together yet.”

“Sure, my treat this time,” Leng Shaoting said.

Gu Ning agreed, because it didn’t make any difference whether she or Leng Shaoting paid the bill.

It wasn’t a secret that Gu Ning was the boss of Jade Beauty Jewelry. Although not everyone was aware of it, many people had heard of it. Therefore after she had stayed in the store for a few minutes, several customers recognized her.

At the beginning, they weren’t sure, but they made sure of it after glancing at Gu Ning a few times. However, even though they recognized Gu Ning, they didn’t go forward to bother her. They were simply impressed by Gu Ning’s outstanding appearance and had a better impression of her.

After a while, Gu Ning and the others left for lunch.

Neither Leng Yuanjin nor Yu Yin wanted to dine in a fancy hotel, because they only dined there when they needed to discuss business with some important figures. The food was also very expensive, so they preferred to have a meal in a local restaurant that had delicious dishes. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

They booked a private room, and ordered their favorite dishes. After that, Leng Yuanjin talked about Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia with Gu Ning. “Ningning, I heard about what Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia did to you before. I know you’re not a weak girl at all, so you can fight back whenever you think it’s necessary.”

Leng Yuanjin looked displeased when she talked about Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia. Actually, nobody in the Leng family liked them, and Leng Yuanjin had a good impression of Gu Ning now, so she disliked Jiang Shuyuan more than ever.

“I understand, Aunt Yuanjin,” Gu Ning said. She felt touched that Leng Yuanjin defended her.

Normally, Gu Ning would fight back to protect herself when other people attacked her. She always fought back when Jiang Shuyuan and Leng Shaojia tried to make things difficult for her. This time was different however, and for Master Leng’s sake, she couldn’t seriously punish Leng Shaojia, but she didn’t feel aggrieved at all.

Leng Yuanjin didn’t mention Gu Ning’s special medicine, because she thought that Gu Ning could make the decision on her own.

Gu Ning never got along with Leng Shaojia after all, so it would be hard for Gu Ning to agree to help Leng Shaojia at this moment. Moreover, Leng Yuanjin also hoped that Leng Shaojia could learn from it by suffering for a few more days. The pain wouldn’t last forever, and Leng Shaojia would be fine in a few months.

In addition, even if the Leng family needed Gu Ning’s medicine to cure Leng Shaojia, Leng Shaojia’s parents should be asking for it. Therefore, Leng Yuanjin was unwilling to talk about the medicine in case Gu Ning was displeased, because although this was her first time meeting Gu Ning, she already treated Gu Ning as a member of the Leng family.

Afterwards, they stopped talking about Leng Shaojia, and Leng Yuanjin asked Gu Ning how she met Leng Shaoting.

Gu Ning told her that she met Leng Shaoting for the first time when he was chasing a criminal. They worked together and successfully caught the criminal in the end.

Leng Yuanjin also joked that Leng Shaoting was too cold and that it must be difficult for Gu Ning to stay with him.

Gu Ning smiled and said that she didn’t feel bored at all when Leng Shaoting was by her side.

Although Leng Shaoting looked a little cold, he was a mature, reliable man, and she wasn’t talkative either, and they were a perfect couple. In Gu Ning’s eyes, Leng Shaoting had far more strengths than weaknesses.
