2932 She Can Stay Here Whenever She Wants

Hearing Gu Ning’s words, the man still refused to believe that she really meant it. He felt that Gu Ning was just acting and trying to scare him, so he said, “Oh, you called your father. It seems your father is influential. I want to see what your father can do.”

The man suddenly became bold under the effect of alcohol.

He was slightly drunk and was in a bad mood today, so he wasn’t afraid of causing trouble. If he was clear-headed, he wouldn’t have made it difficult for them.

After all, he knew what a Black Card meant. Only people who had a close relationship with the boss could have one, so he would annoy the boss if he offended those who had a Black Card.

!!

“You’ll see!” Gu Ning said with a vague smile.

The woman next to the man, however, felt anxious, but she couldn’t do anything about it.

Within five minutes, the hotel manager rushed over. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The man had stayed in Huangdeng Hotel many times before, so he knew the manager. Once he saw the hotel manager, he had a premonition.

Did this girl really have the ability to blacklist him? If so, this girl must be powerful.

“Miss, I’m the hotel manager, Zhao Teng. I’m so sorry to hear that you didn’t have a pleasant experience in our hotel. Do you want to blacklist this gentleman? I’ll do that right away. Please don’t be mad.” As soon as the hotel manager came, he apologized to Gu Ning carefully.

Seeing that, the man was struck dumb. Could this girl really blacklist him so easily?

“Manager Zhao, we came here earlier than her, but the receptionist told us there aren’t any vacant rooms. However, when she came, the receptionist changed her words. That’s not fair. Even though she has a Black Card, she still needs to obey the rule of first come, first served.” The man argued.

“Mr. Yu, there are rules in our hotel. The guest rooms available to outsiders are indeed all booked, but we still have rooms kept for insiders, those who have a Black Card. These rooms are never available to outsiders,” Zhao Teng explained.

If there weren’t reserved rooms for insiders, the Black Card would be meaningless.

After all, the Black Card promised that you could stay in the hotel for free whenever you needed a room. Otherwise, the Black Card wouldn’t be so valuable.

“And, this is the daughter of our chairman. Huangdeng Hotel is owned by her family. She can stay here whenever she wants. No one can chase her out,” Zhao Teng continued.

Hearing that, the woman who recognized Gu Ning wasn’t surprised, but all the other people were shocked. They didn’t expect the girl to be the daughter of the chairman of Tanghuang.

Although Gu Ning didn’t think it was necessary to tell other people her background, since Zhao Teng already said it, she wouldn’t stop him, otherwise he would be embarrassed. After all, he came to help her.

“Sir, I don’t want to bully you just because I have a high status. I really hate that kind of behavior, but if you dare to do that to me first, I won’t hesitate to pay you back. I told you not to cause trouble here, but you wouldn’t listen.” Gu Ning spoke to the man, then turned to face Zhao Teng. “Alright, I’ll leave it to you now, Manager Zhao. I need to go have a rest.”

“Of course, be my guest, miss.” Zhao Teng responded with a bow.

The receptionist immediately handed the room card to Gu Ning, then she walked away.

In that instant, the man sobered up from fright. If the woman didn’t support him, he might have collapsed to the ground.

“Mr. Yu, you should leave.” Zhao Teng chased them away. Although Mr. Yu was a frequent guest of Huangdeng Hotel, he had offended Tang Yunfan’s daughter, so he had to leave.

Most importantly, Mr. Yu made it difficult for them first, otherwise Gu Ning wouldn’t have used her privilege.

The man said nothing further and could only walk away. He now regretted arguing with Gu Ning, but it was too late. He was already on the blacklist of Huangdeng Hotel.

After they walked away, the woman didn’t dare say that she actually recognized Gu Ning, because the man would vent his anger on her if he knew. He would definitely blame her for not reminding him.

Even though she had tried a few times, the man ignored her, so she decided to say nothing.

…

In the room.

Gu Ning took a shower, then went to bed. Her mood wasn’t affected because of the drama, because she didn’t suffer any losses.

Gu Ning had booked a flight which would take off at 10:20 am the next morning to City B. It would take her forty-five minutes to get to the airport from the hotel, so she set off at 8:30 am in an exclusive car provided by the hotel.

Although Gu Ning learned that the real mastermind was Wei Youwei, Huang Yuwen didn’t give her much evidence, so it was impossible for them to punish Wei Youwei according to the law. There were only some of their call records, which wasn’t enough proof.

Gu Ning could catch him and force him to tell her what he had done, but she first wanted to talk to Tang Yunhang after she returned to City B.

After a two hour long flight, Gu Ning arrived back in City B and went directly back to the Tang family’s house.

Only Tang Haifeng and Gu Man were at home, since the others had already left for work.

Neither Tang Haifeng nor Gu Man asked her about her trip to City H, because she had done it after having a private chat with Tang Yunhang.

However, Gu Man heard Gu Ning’s call with Tang Yunfan last night and knew that something went wrong, so she asked Gu Ning about it concernedly.

“Ningning, what happened at the hotel last night?” Gu Man asked.

“Did something go wrong at the hotel last night?” Tang Haifeng asked in surprise.

“Well, a couple wanted to book a room at Huangdeng Hotel last night, but there wasn’t any room available for outsiders, whereas I have a Black Card, so there is a reserved room for me. The man got mad because of that and argued with me. I told him to stop, otherwise I would put him on the blacklist, but he refused. So I called my father and solved the problem,” Gu Ning explained.

“How dare he argue with you after you showed the Black Card? He’s an idiot!” Tang Haifeng said. He didn’t think Gu Ning was wrong, because sometimes it was necessary to teach stupid people a lesson.
