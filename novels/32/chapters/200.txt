Chapter 201 Leng Shaoting’s Real Identity

Even though, Ding Peiwei didn’t think that she was joking. Ding Peiwei was surprised. How come a teenage girl had the air of a successful businesswoman?

“I understand that I’m too young to make you believe that I’m being serious, but I truly mean it. My family is involved in the real estate industry. Although my family’s company isn’t comparable with Hongyun Real Estate, we have enough money to acquire this land. If you’re willing to consider my proposal, please have a discussion with the citizens here before we sign the contract,” Gu Ning said.

Ding Peiwei couldn’t make the decision alone, so Gu Ning didn’t force him to promise her anything. However, she was confident that she could settle the deal.

In the beginning Ding Peiwei was excited to hear the offer. If they could have a reasonable compensation, they wouldn’t be worried about the housing issue. However, he soon calmed down, and asked with doubt, “Since it’s your family business, can you, a child make the decision? And the chairman of Hongyun Real Estate is Fang Changsheng, whose brother-in-law is the director of the Roads and Traffic Authority. Moreover, the director’s cousin is the vice mayor. Are you sure your family can handle them?”

Anyone who wanted to acquire this land had to have the permission of the government.

Although Ding Peiwei believed Gu Ning to some extent, he doubted her ability. He didn’t know Gu Ning or her background after all. It was difficult for him to depend on a stranger. Meanwhile, he knew more about Hongyun Real Estate, which was one of the three biggest real estate companies in City G with several billion yuan in assets, ranked ninth on the list of the richest. It also had support from the government.

The reason why Hongyun Real Estate was able to win the right of acquisition before the open acquisition was that it had a strong network in the government.

Gu Ning understood that she had to show her ability to persuade Ding Peiwei.

“What if I tell you my support in the government is even more powerful than Hongyun Real Estate?” Gu Ning asked.

Hearing that, Ding Peiwei was astonished. He stared at her face, intending to know whether it was true.

Gu Ning added, “Mr. Ding, I know that it’s hard for you to trust me because we just met and don’t know each other, but I do hope that you can consider my offer. If you’re willing to sell this land to me, I can sign the contract and pay you the compensation on site. It doesn’t matter if you want the compensation in cash, check, by transfer or you simply want houses, I’m totally fine with it. As long as you sign the contract, you’ll get the money you should have. Don’t you think it’s a great offer? However, if you let Hongyun Real Estate take this land, you won’t get a reasonable compensation.”

Ding Peiwei was shocked as well as thrilled. They could sign the contract and get the compensation on site! It had never happened before. Normally, the compensation would only be transferred to their accounts after the acquisition had been over for a long time.

If Gu Ning could keep her promise, it was a great advantage to them. And it would be a bad idea if they sold this land to Hongyun Real Estate.

“Great! I’m willing to trust you for now, and I’ll talk to my neighbors later,” Ding Peiwei chose to believe Gu Ning.

“Very well. This is my number. Please call me once you make up your mind. However, I hope you can make it quick, because if Hongyun Real Estate finds out, you would suffer under its pressure,” Gu Ning reminded him.

“Sure, I’ll give you the answer before tonight.” Ding Peiwei also understood that if Hongyun Real Estate found out, it would probably force them to sell this land in a violent way. And they would be the victims.

“That would be great!” Gu Ning also wanted to know the answer today. After exchanging numbers with Ding Peiwei, Gu Ning asked again, “Oh, how large is this street approximately, and how many households are here?”

“Zhengyang Street is about seventy thousand square meters with 558 households,” Ding Peiwei answered.

A piece of land that was seventy thousand square meters wasn’t very large, but it was suitable to build a living area, mainly because of its good location.

It was 4 pm when Gu Ning said good-bye to Ding Peiwei, and it was too late to go to the street of antiques. Gu Ning also needed to use her network to gain the right of land acquisition.

Although Ding Peiwei hadn’t given her an

affirmative answer yet, she believed that they would agree. No one would reject her proposal especially in front of Hongyun Real Estate, not unless Hongyun Real Estate was willing to offer a higher

compensation than her.

“Let me help you with the right of land acquisition.” Leng Shaoting hadn’t been at Gu Ning’s side, but he had stayed near and heard their talk clearly.

“Will it be convenient for you?” Gu Ning asked.

She had planned to turn to Yan Zhenglin for help because Yan Zhenglin worked in politics. Leng Shaoting served in the military, and wasn’t that familiar with the politicians.

“Of course,” Leng Shaoting said. It wasn’t a big deal to him. And even if it was a big deal, he would try his best to settle it for Gu Ning.

“Thanks!” Gu Ning answered. She didn’t want to hurt his feelings.

Leng Shaoting wasn’t personally familiar with the authorities, but his family was involved in politics. The Leng Family was involved in military, politics and business, and was the head of the four most

influential families in the capital.

Yes, Leng Shaoting was exactly the eldest grandson in his family which was the leading family in the capital, but he had gotten everything that he owned today by himself and had never asked his family for help.

Gu Ning then told Leng Shaoting what happened with Shenghua Real Estate.

Leng Shaoting avoided Gu Ning to call someone, so Gu Ning didn’t know who he called. She didn’t ask either. Everyone had his or her own secrets anyway. She kept many secrets from Leng Shaoting too.

Before long, the right of land acquisition was settled.

That being the case, Shenghua Real Estate and Hongyun Real Estate became competitors. Gu Ning decided to close the deal before Hongyun Real Estate even knew about it.

She immediately called An Guangyao telling him about what she had done in City G, and told him to prepare the contract along with the lawyers and assistants before she called him again. If it was successful, he would have to fly to City G tomorrow morning to go through the procedures.

She had already prepared the money.

Hearing the news, An Guangyao was shocked by Gu Ning’s efficiency. Although her action was a little abrupt and lacked thorough consideration, An Guangyao had to admit that she had made the right decision.

Normally, a real estate company needed to make allowances not only for funds and workers, but also the land when it was going to build buildings.
