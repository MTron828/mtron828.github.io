Chapter 1807: She Looks like a Siren

“She looks like a siren,” Gao Shiyan said in a low voice. The other girls didn’t hear it, but Gu Ning did. She knew Gao Shiyan was talking about her.

Gu Ning was displeased, but Gao Shiyan didn’t point her name out, so she could say nothing about it. She was unwilling to make a connection after all. Therefore, Gu Ning ignored her and began to organize her stuff.

“Gu Ning, may I help?” asked Song Miaoge.

“No need, thanks. I don’t have much stuff. It should be done in a minute,” said Gu Ning.

“Sure!” Song Miaoge didn’t insist.

Gu Ning really had carried very few things with her. There were only two sets of bed sheets and duvet covers, five sets of clothes and two pairs of shoes, as well as daily necessities.

Although it was early autumn, the weather was still very hot, so they were still wearing short sleeves. The clothes were light and thin, which didn’t take up much space at all.

As for skincare and makeup products, Gu Ning didn’t have any, because she didn’t need them. She had her magical power to help her take care of her skin.

Gu Ning wouldn’t put on makeup unless it was necessary. Therefore, she stored her makeup products along with her other changes of clothes in her telepathic eye space. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Oh, a poor girl,” said Gao Shiyan unkindly after giving a glance at Gu Ning’s stuff.

She still kept her voice down, but Song Miaoge heard it this time and didn’t hesitate to argue with her once more. “Someone’s really stupid. A poor girl can’t afford a sluxurious dorm room.”

“What did you say?” Gao Shiyan was mad.

“I said that to the stupid idiot. I didn’t point out a name. Why do you have to make a connection?” Song Miaoge mocked. Although she refused to admit it, her attitude obviously showed that she was criticizing Gao Shiyan.

“You...” Gao Shiyan was angry. Song Miaoge didn’t point out her name, but she knew that she was talking about her.

“You didn’t point out a name, but you said that right after me. You were talking about me!” said Gao Shiyan.

“In that case, when you mentioned a poor girl, were you talking about me?” asked Gu Ning in a flat voice, but she was displeased since she opened her mouth.

She was kind to other people, but it didn’t mean she could easily be bullied.

“So what? I was indeed talking about you. Look at your clothes. Even if you can afford a luxurious dorm room, you might be a girl who only cares about money and luxuries. You might have a sugar-daddy who’s supporting you as well,” Gao Shiyan mocked.

“What the f*ck did you say?” Song Miaoge was furious at once. She abruptly sat up and was about to do something, but Gu Ning gave her a glance to stop her.

Knowing that Gu Ning wasn’t weak at all, Song Miaoge calmed herself down.

Gu Ning didn’t lose her temper, but she actually was full of anger, so she squinted, glaring at Gao Shiyan, which made Gao Shiyan feel uneasy.

“You said I’m a poor girl, and it’s also you who said I have a sugar-daddy. Isn’t it contradictory? Have you ever seen a girl with a sugar-daddy being so poor as me?” Gu Ning said in a cold voice, “In addition, it has nothing to do with you even if I’m poor. I don’t spend your money anyway.”

“Come on, you don’t have any makeup products. You might secretly use ours when we’re absent!”

Feeling uneasy under Gu Ning’s look, Gao Shiyan didn’t dare to say the word sugar-daddy again.

Song Miaoge couldn’t help but roll her eyes. Gu Ning owned a makeup company and she had endless makeup products to use as long as she wanted. Gao Shiyan made herself a joke!

“Do you take me as a thief?” Gu Ning sneered with dissatisfaction.

“It always happens in the dormitories. I’m just protecting my stuff,” said Gao Shiyan. It was obvious that she took Gu Ning as a thief.

“It’s ridiculous. ”

“Keep on bragging! Your face is so white. Even though you don’t wear much makeup, you must have put on some foundation,” said Gao Shiyan. She refused to believe that Gu Ning had flawless skin.

“Believe it or not, but you should stop attacking, humiliating, or challenging me. I have a quick temper. If you offend me, I won’t take responsibility for my bad behavior towards you.” Gu Ning lost patience and warned Gao Shiyan.

She could forgive Gao Shiyan once for slandering her, but she wouldn’t hesitate to teach her a lesson if she dared to do it again.

Gao Shiyan was scared by Gu Ning’s serious expression, but she got angry with embarrassment afterwards. “How dare you threaten me!”

“So what? Don’t you dare attack me again!” said Gu Ning in a cold voice.

“You...” Gao Shiyan accepted her challenge and abruptly stood up to beat Gu Ning.

She was a spoiled kid of a rich family and was quite used to beating other people once she was annoyed.

Song Miaoge knew that Gu Ning wasn’t weak at all, so she didn’t stand out at this time. Gu Ning didn’t need her help at all.

It was impossible for Lu Xiaoxiao to stop Gao Shiyan, because she was in the same boat as her. She also disliked Gu Ning and was afraid that Song Miaoge might jump out.

When she saw Song Miaoge remaining quiet, she felt relieved.

In fact, if Song Miaoge joined the fight, she would be really worried that Gao Shiyan might be hurt. After all, Song Miaoge had learned many fighting skills.

Gao Shiyan dashed to the front of Gu Ning, then raised her hand trying to slap Gu Ning.

In the following seconds, they heard clear slaps, but it was Gu Ning who slapped Gao Shiyan across the face.

Before Gao Shiyan’s hand could touch Gu Ning’s cheek, Gu Ning slapped her first. She slapped Gao Shiyan’s cheeks four times and Gao Shiyan was totally shocked.

Not only Gao Shiyan, but Lu Xiaoxiao was also stunned. To their astonishment, Gao Shiyan was the one who was slapped.

Song Miaoge was slightly surprised, but soon went back to normal, because it wasn’t beyond her expectation.

Actually, Song Miaoge quite enjoyed watching it.

“You, how dare you slap me!” Although Gao Shiyan was struck dumb for a moment, the pain from her cheeks soon drew her back to reality. She was furious now.
