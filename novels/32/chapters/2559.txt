Chapter 2562: Expose Their Secrets

Otherwise, they would be exhausted after running for several days. After all, their enemies weren’t ordinary people, they were mutants.

In fact, not only a mutant was chasing Qi Tianlin; a ninja who was controlling the mutant was also chasing him. In other words, a mutant and a ninja were chasing Qi Tianlin at the same time.

In such a situation, it wasn’t easy for Qi Tianlin to run and stay safe for three days.

Qi Tianlin didn’t say anything when he saw Baili Zongxue. He had no strength to ask about that now. He only hoped that Gu Ning could help him get rid of the disgusting mutant.

Although Qi Tianlin didn’t know that Gu Ning had superpowers, he believed that she could handle it.

“Well, I can finally relax since you’ve come. I haven’t rested in days. Please help me deal with it,” said Qi Tianlin, sounding weak.

“Sure, but you must pay me,” said Gu Ning.

Gu Ning didn’t come to save Qi Tianlin for free, she decided to help him for ten million yuan.

Ten million yuan was nothing in Qi Tianlin’s opinion. Even if Gu Ning asked for a hundred million yuan, he would still be willing to pay her. After all, his life was worth much more than just that.

Gu Ning was aware of that, but she only asked for a reasonable price.

Qi Tianlin shrugged and said nothing further.

After that, they went into a private room and ordered some dishes.

During these past few days, Qi Tianlin and his people hadn’t had a good meal, so today they would enjoy a great meal.

After ordering, the waiter left. Gu Ning asked, “How did you run into the mutants?”

Although she shouldn’t ask about that, she wanted to know more about the mutants.

Due to Country R’s relationship with their country, she had to be careful and take action to stop the mutants from attacking them.

If she wanted to stop them, she had to learn more about them.

Since Qi Tianlin got into trouble with mutants, she could collect information from him.

She didn’t need to know what grudges Qi Tianlin had against the person behind the mutants; she only needed to know who the person was.

Qi Tianlin slightly frowned when Gu Ning asked him straightforwardly. He said nothing, but gave Baili Zongxue a meaningful glance.

He understood that Gu Ning must trust Baili Zongxue since she asked him that question in front of her, but he still needed to make sure.

Gu Ning understood his worries at once, so she explained. “She’s one of us. She’s already aware of the existence of strange creatures.”

If so, there was nothing for Qi Tianlin to be worried about, so he said, “I didn’t know who sent the mutant to kill me last time, but this time I have a name in my mind. I think it’s the Ueno family from Country R. It’s one of the three major families in Country R. It’s involved in politics on the surface, but it actually has a deep connection with the underground world. It’s also one of the three largest illegal gangs in Country R. I have a good relationship with the heir of the Mafia of Country Y, but he has grudges against the head of the illegal gang controlled by the Ueno family. So I’ve also been targeted.”

“If so, the Ueno family is really ambitious. It’s dominant in politics and also has great influence in the underground world. They also have mutants and ninjas. I’m afraid they are aiming for the presidential seat.” Gu Ning made the conclusion.

It was true that the Ueno family wanted to get the presidential seat of Country R.

Because Country R was still an autocratic monarchy, the monarch had the highest status and the greatest power.

“I had the same thought, so I plan to expose the Ueno family’s secrets. The other major families will seize the chance to cause the Ueno family trouble. They’ll be busy scheming against each other and I’ll be safe. I can also enjoy watching the drama,” said Qi Tianlin.

Although Qi Tianlin was the head of an illegal gang and had done many illegal things, he wouldn’t betray their country. Instead, he would defend it.

At least when other countries wanted to attack their country, he would side with their country without hesitation.

Otherwise he wouldn’t have the thought of exposing the Ueno family’s secrets and causing Country R to be in political chaos.

“It’s a good idea.” Gu Ning agreed. When their enemies were in political chaos, they could enjoy watching the drama.

However, Gu Ning still needed to conduct a further investigation on the mutants. Because the Ueno family was really influential, other major families might not be able to defeat them.

Therefore, they couldn’t completely rely on the Ueno family’s enemies in politics. If they wanted to totally get rid of them, they had to do something on their own.

About twenty minutes later, the dishes were placed on the table.

At the same time, Gu Ning sensed evil energy approaching them. She used her Jade Eyes to look around, then saw a MPV with three people sitting inside driving into the underground parking lot of the restaurant.

To be specific, there were two mortals and a mutant.

She didn’t know how they managed to not lose Qi Tianlin. It was unbelievable that they followed him wherever he went.

Precisely because of that, Qi Tianlin had to run away all the time. He couldn’t stop, or he would be caught.

It was two ninjas and a mutant, who were much stronger than ordinary people, so Qi Tianlin was no match for them no matter how skilled he was. Otherwise, he would have already defeated them.

Anyway, Gu Ning was with him now, so Qi Tianlin wasn’t worried.

Gu Ning sensed evil energy, so did Baili Zongxue because they were only a short distance of ten meters away from them.

As soon as Baili Zongxue sensed the evil energy, she gave Gu Ning a glance.

Gu Ning was better than her, so Baili Zongxue was sure that Gu Ning must have felt it before her, but Gu Ning said nothing, and decided to have the meal first, so Baili Zongxue said nothing either.

Gu Ning understood that the mutant was nearby, but she didn’t tell Qi Tianlin. She wanted to let him finish the meal first.

Although the mutant knew that Qi Tianlin was here, it didn’t take action right away. After all, they were in the crowded city center so they decided to follow Qi Tianlin till they found a good chance. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After having the meal, Gu Ning and her friends paid the bill and left.

When they arrived at the parking lot, Gu Ning saw the car where the mutant and ninjas were sitting. However, she didn’t pay much attention to them, so they didn’t notice anything wrong.
