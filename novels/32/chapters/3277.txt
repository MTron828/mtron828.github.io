3279 Don’t You Dare Leave!

On her way, Leng Xiaoyao called Li Mochen and told him that she won the championship at the Liberal Arts Defense.

Li Mochen wasn’t surprised at all because he was aware of Leng Xiaoyao’s abilities, but he still congratulated her.

“Oh, our teacher said that the champion can take part in the national competition in the capital city. The top 3 can directly be accepted by the Capital University! Even if I can’t get into the top 3, I believe I will still be accepted by the Capital University by passing the exam,” Leng Xiaoyao said proudly. She wasn’t difficult to talk to as before. Right now she was like a kid waiting for praise.

“Sure, I believe you can do that. When will you go to participate in the competition? I can take you to see the house,” asked Li Mochen.

“I don’t know yet. I’ll tell you when I know,” said Leng Xiaoyao. She couldn’t wait to see the house.

“No problem,” said Li Mochen.

After that, Leng Xiaoyao asked Li Mochen about the situation in City Qin. The competition was over, so she had time to go there now.

Li Mochen said that there was no news and stopped Leng Xiaoyao from going. They could handle it on their own.

Leng Xiaoyao was just a girl. Even though she was extremely strong, Li Mochen didn’t want to bother her.

Since Li Mochen said that, Leng Xiaoyao didn’t insist. There was nothing for her to be worried about. However, she still reminded him to be careful.

Li Mochen agreed and felt somewhat warmed.

After having the call with Li Mochen, the taxi driver said, “Girl, you’re awesome! You won the first prize. I wish my son could be half as excellent as you at studying, but he’s the worst student in their class.”

“Sir, different people have different advantages. He’s not good at studying. Perhaps he has other skills. Some students are excellent at studying, but they might not be successful in the future. After all, some doctors or masters still have an average job without a high salary, whereas some people who are highly skilled make a lot more money. Well, it’s best to be a good student and have other skills, but it’s really hard to have both. Sir, don’t worry, and don’t force your kid to listen to you. Perhaps they have good luck and will fulfill their potential in their own way.” Leng Xiaoyao was in a good mood, so she said a lot to the taxi driver.

“You’re right.”

Arriving at the office building, Leng Xiaoyao entered the elevator.

The elevator was not too crowded, but as soon as Leng Xiaoyao walked inside, a man started moving towards her with a lecherous look, which immediately annoyed Leng Xiaoyao.

The other people in the elevator did not try to stop him and instead looked at him with fear in their eyes.

It seemed that this man had behaved like this before and had some kind of power, which prevented anyone from reporting him. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

As he got closer to Long Xiaoyao, he reached out his hand towards Long Xiaoyao’s butt.

However, before he could touch Long Xiaoyao, she grabbed his hand and with a loud snap, broke it.

The elevator erupted into screams and everyone turned to look at them in surprise.

Seeing that Leng Xiaoyao grabbed the man’s hand, and the man’s face was distorted in pain, they realized where that cracking sound came from.

The man, whose name was Lin Lipeng, was the personnel manager of the 19th floor design company and was known for being a pervert who frequently harassed young girls in the office building.

Although he usually only touched them, it was enough to make them feel disgusted and scared.

“Y-Y-You…” Lin Lipeng didn’t expect this girl to break his hand. He was furious and wanted to accuse Leng Xiaoyao, but he was in too much pain to speak.

Leng Xiaoyao stared at him coldly and said, “Not all girls are easy to bully. If you keep walking down this path, you’ll eventually meet your match.”

“Do you know who I am? If you dare to harm me, I’ll make sure you won’t be able to stay here for long.” Lin Lipeng threatened, but he didn’t dare to directly attack Leng Xiaoyao because her earlier move showed that she was skilled and he was no match for her.

“If you have the guts, come and make me leave!” Leng Xiaoyao replied fearlessly, even arrogantly.

“Y-You…”

Seeing Leng Xiaoyao act so arrogantly, Lin Lipeng was momentarily speechless and wondered if she had a powerful background.

However, then he thought, their company was the largest in this office building, even if this girl had a powerful background, could it be more powerful than his brother-in-law’s?

With this thought, Lin Lipeng was no longer afraid.

At this point, they reached the 15th floor and Leng Xiaoyao was about to exit the elevator.

Lin Lipeng immediately shouted, “Stop right there!”

Leng Xiaoyao paused and turned back to face Lin Lipeng. “What’s up?” she asked.

“Stay here and don’t leave,” Lin Lipeng said. He wanted to go back to the company and tell his brother-in-law to seek revenge for him.

The 15th floor was where Fengyang Technology used to be before it became Xiaoyao Technology, but it was just a small company and was not worth worrying about. Lin Lipeng was very confident.

“Okay! If you don’t come back within ten minutes, you’re a coward,” Leng Xiaoyao said without any intention of making a mountain out of a molehill.

Anyway, it couldn’t be made less serious. This man would definitely come looking for trouble.

While she was there, she wanted to solve the problem so that they wouldn’t cause trouble when she wasn’t around.

“Let’s go and see!” Lin Lipeng said fiercely.

Leng Xiaoyao arrived at the company and everyone was still there. After all, it was only 5:30 pm and their work ended at 6 pm.

As soon as Leng Xiaoyao arrived, she told Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai about what had happened in the elevator. They both looked extremely unhappy.

“That man must be Lin Lipeng, the nephew of the boss of Chengyun Design Company. He often does things like taking advantage of girls and even almost raped a girl once,” Mu Yufan said. Mentioning Lin Lipeng made both Mu Yufan and Zhou Yunkai disgusted.

“It seems like we need to deal with him. I don’t want Xiyin to be targeted.” Leng Xiaoyao frowned. If she let Shen Xiyin be taken advantage of or harassed by this man, she would feel very guilty. Now that she knew about this hidden danger, it was necessary to solve it.
