3399 Don’t You Have Any Sense of Shame

Leng Xiaoyao wasn’t a boarding student, so she could leave after the afternoon military training ended.

The evening class at the Capital University was open to everyone. Students could go or not, but they had to finish the usual classes. If anyone was going to be absent, the student had to ask for leave in advance.

Li Mochen wasn’t in the capital city the past few days, so Leng Xiaoyao had dinner with An Chenmeng and the others at noon and night, but Li Mochen returned today, so Leng Xiaoyao went to have dinner with him.

Li Mochen came directly to the school to pick up Leng Xiaoyao. Since Leng Xiaoyao was driving, Li Mochen didn’t drive and asked Mu Yuan to drop him off at the gate of the Capital University.

Li Mochen’s extremely handsome appearance immediately attracted countless people’s attention and admiration, regardless of gender.

“Oh my god! This man is too handsome! He’s even more handsome than my idol.”

“I don’t know if he’s a star! If he is, it’s strange that he isn’t popular!”

“I don’t think so. If he were, he would have been popular long ago. He’s just too handsome.”

“Exactly, he’s too handsome.”

Every woman who saw Li Mochen wanted to go over and talk to him. They were a group of college students, and most people’s thoughts weren’t evil and complicated yet. Moreover, Li Mochen, such a stunning man, was like a god, sacred and inviolable.

Therefore, they could only look up to him.

When Leng Xiaoyao walked out, although she was wearing camouflage like everyone else, she still easily caught people’s attention.

Because they had military training for six days, everyone had different degrees of tanning except for Leng Xiaoyao. She was still as fair as before, which was hard to not notice.

As a result, it aroused the envy and jealousy of other girls.

“Her skin is so good that she didn’t even get tanned. That’s so enviable.”

“Exactly! I’ve applied so much sunscreen, but I still got tanned.”

“I really want to ask her what sunscreen she has used, but I’m afraid to. I heard she has a bad temper.”

“Many people who go to talk to her are looking for trouble. It would be strange if she has a good temper towards them. If you don’t go looking for trouble, she won’t give you a cold reception.”

Therefore, the girl ran towards Leng Xiaoyao and asked her what sunscreen she used and why her skin didn’t get tanned.

Leng Xiaoyao was polite to everyone who wasn’t looking for trouble. She smiled and said, “Actually, I didn’t use any sunscreen! It may be a genetic effect or because I’m used to being under the sun for a long time. I practice martial arts all year round, so I’ve been under the sun a lot. You guys probably don’t get much sun exposure, so you’re more likely to get tanned suddenly, or it could be a skin problem. Some skin can withstand sun exposure, while some can’t.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Although the girl was surprised that Leng Xiaoyao didn’t use sunscreen, she didn’t think that Leng Xiaoyao was just refusing to tell her. In addition, Leng Xiaoyao’s attitude was very good. She wasn’t as arrogant as rumored.

“How was it?”

The girl’s friends walked over to ask for the result when Leng Xiaoyao left.

“I think Leng Xiaoyao is quite easy to talk to! She doesn’t have a bad temper and she’s not as arrogant as rumored. She talked to me politely. So she treats different people differently. As long as you are polite to her, she won’t give you a cold reception,” the girl said.

“Did she say what sunscreen she has used?”

“She said she didn’t use any sunscreen. It’s probably because of her genes and because she practices martial arts all year round under the sun, so the sun doesn’t affect her much,” the girl said.

Some people agreed with that answer because Leng Xiaoyao really didn’t seem to be under any pressure in front of any task during military training.

However, some people thought that Leng Xiaoyao was being hypocritical and just didn’t want to say it.

However, they didn’t dare to say that out loud. Not all jealousy led to direct conflict.

Those who were paying attention to Li Mochen thought that Leng Xiaoyao was going to talk to him when she walked towards him.

Therefore, many people wanted to see the drama, wondering if Leng Xiaoyao would be ruthlessly rejected.

However, they were surprised that when Leng Xiaoyao approached him, Li Mochen’s expression softened and he even smiled.

When Leng Xiaoyao approached him, he directly took her hand and they left.

Their relationship couldn’t be more obvious!

Not everyone recognized Leng Xiaoyao. They only saw that she was very beautiful and matched the man well.

Li Mochen and Leng Xiaoyao left under the gazes of jealousy and envy.

“What do you want to eat tonight?” Li Mochen asked.

Leng Xiaoyao said, “How about steak?”

Afterwards, they went to have steak. After enjoying their meal, they went to see a movie.

Leng Xiaoyao was still wearing her military training clothes and didn’t bother to change. Li Mochen didn’t mind either.

However, they ran into an acquaintance, Tao Yixiao, at the cinema.

Tao Yixiao was with a man.

Anyway, it had nothing to do with Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen, so they just gave them a glance. It was very normal, but when Tao Yixiao saw them, she immediately let go of the man’s hand and came over to explain to Li Mochen. “Brother Mochen, please don’t misunderstand it. I have no close relationship with him.”

Leng Xiaoyao and Li Mochen were surprised by Tao Yixiao’s words. Li Mochen calmly said, “What does it matter if you have a close relationship with him or not? I don’t care.”

Tao Yixiao only realized what she had done then and didn’t think much of it before.

The man who was with Tao Yixiao had an unpleasant expression and immediately walked over to question them. “What is your relationship with him?”

“Miss Tao, can you have some decency? You came to my boyfriend and talked nonsense. If you do it again, I’ll hit you!” Leng Xiaoyao was also a little angry and threatened her at once.

Boyfriend!!!

This was the first time that Leng Xiaoyao had admitted that he was her boyfriend. It made Li Mochen very happy.

“I-I-I…” Tao Yixiao was a little at a loss, especially under the angry gaze of her boyfriend. She was completely panicked.

After Tao Zheng warned her, she had the idea of ??giving up on Li Mochen.

Didn’t people say that in order to forget an old love, you need to start a new one? So she tried to get together with the man who had been pursuing her for a long time.

They had just been together for a few days. They both happened to be free today, so they came to see a movie. They didn’t expect to run into Li Mochen and she couldn’t help but want to explain.

In fact, it was all her inner fantasy at work. She fantasized that after she and another man got together, Li Mochen would meet them and get angry and regret it…

“Humph!” Leng Xiaoyao didn’t want to entangle with Tao Yixiao any longer, so she snorted coldly and pulled Li Mochen away from them into the cinema.
