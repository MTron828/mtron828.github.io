Chapter 135: Force Gu Xiaoxiao to Leave City F

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Before Gu Ning said a word, Chu Peihan was mad. “Gu Xiaoxiao, you’re indeed shameless! Ningning is fine only because she isn’t weak. If she hadn’t successfully beaten down those hoodlums, she would have been ruined. Shut your mouth now! Otherwise I’ll punch you silent.”

Chu Peihan threatened Gu Xiaoxiao but none of the teachers stopped her. Because Chu Peihan was right. If Gu Ning hadn’t successfully beaten down those hoodlums, she would have been ruined already.

Gu Xiaoxiao had to take the responsibility.

“Gu Xiaoxiao, I didn’t call the police and send you to jail. That’s the best I can do. You should be thankful that you’re from the Gu Family. I’ll save your face only for the sake of my mother. Besides, your behavior affects our school’s reputation badly. It’s impossible for you to stay,” Gu Ning said. She believed that she had shown her mercy already.

“You...” Gu Xiaoxiao couldn’t retort, although she still refused to face it.

Outside, Wang Chengqi called Gu Qinxiang.

Gu Qinxiang saw that it was Wang Chengqi’s call. He unconsciously thought that Xiaoxiao probably made some mistakes.

“Hi, professor Wang,” Gu Qinxiang immediately answered the call.

“Hi, Mr. Gu, the thing is your daughter Gu Xiaoxiao had a conflict with one of our students. She turned to the Qing Gang for help to ruin that female student. Although the female student survived, we have decided to expel Gu Xiaoxiao. Please come to the school as soon as possible,” Wang Chengqi said.

“What?”

Knowing that, Gu Qinxiang was totally struck dumb. It was so unbelievable. He understood that Gu Xiaoxiao had been naughty since she had been a little girl, but he never expected that she would do illegal things. She even turned to the Qing Gang this time.

Gu Qinxiang immediately went to the school. He didn’t have time to ask who the student Gu Xiaoxiao had planned to ruin was.

After that, except for Wang Chengqi and Gu Xiaoxiao, the rest all left.

“Gu Ning, I think that it’s not enough that Gu Xiaoxiao only leaves the school,” Chu Peihan said with disappointment. She didn’t care about Jiang Yuan and Zhang Qiuhua who were walking ahead of her at all.

“Don’t worry, if she continues to behave like that, she’ll ruin herself one day in the future,” Gu Ning said plainly.

Jiang Yuan and Zhang Qiuhua only turned around and gave them a glance, but didn’t say a word. They were right after all. Gu Ning, who was the victim, didn’t get any compensation nor apologies. It was understandable that Chu Peihan felt angry for her.

If the victim had been Chu Peihan, the thing wouldn’t end so easily.

Gu Ning’s words also made sense. If Gu Xiaoxiao’s character remained the same, she would ruin herself one day. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

When Jiang Yuan and Zhang Qiuhua turned their heads back, Gu Ning pulled out her phone. She opened Wechat typing down lines of words. Gu Ning showed them to Chu Peihan first then sent them into the Wechat group.

Gu Ning: “Spread the news that Gu Xiaoxiao turned to gangsters for help to rape a female student to every high school in our city. Force Gu Xiaoxiao to leave City F! However, don’t say that the female student is me.”

Chu Peihan was cheered up a little. It was a piece of cake for them to spread the news.

Although Hao Ran and others were in the middle of class, except for Mu Ke and Yu Mixi, they all played on their phones during the classes. Thus they read the message at once.

They were also happy to hear that Gu Xiaoxiao was expelled.

When Gu Ning was back in her classroom, she noticed that Shao Feifei was gloating. Gu Ning was confused. She wasn’t the one who was in trouble now. Why was Shao Feifei gloating?

Apparently, Gu Ning didn’t think the Qing Gang would revenge itself on her. In addition, Gu Ning had Chu Peihan to protect her. The Qing Gang would certainly not revenge itself on Gu Ning.

Before long, Gu Qinxiang arrived at the school. He didn’t tell Lin Lijuan, but went to the school alone.

Gu Xiaoxiao and Wang Chengqi were waiting for Gu Qinxiang in the Academic Affairs Office.

Gu Qinxiang had a quick temper. He was so mad at Gu Xiaoxiao’s behavior, so he slapped Gu Xiaoxiao directly the minute he arrived without asking for the reason.

Gu Xiaoxiao’s red swollen cheeks were hurt once more. It was too painful for her to say a word.

She was annoyed that Gu Qingxiang had slapped her, but she didn’t dare to fight back, so she blamed Gu Ning for all of this. She thought that it was all Gu Ning’s fault.

Gu Ning was fine now. Why couldn’t she forgive her?

Gu Xiaoxiao was indeed rotten to the bone. It was her fault, but now she blamed Gu Ning for it.

“Gu Xiaoxiao, how dare you to do that!” Gu Qinxiang raised his voice in anger.

Compared with the fact that Gu Xiaoxiao had planned to ruin a female student, Gu Qinxiang was more annoyed that Gu Xiaoxiao had a connection with the Qing Gang. He was worried that that connection would affect the Gu Family.

After that, Gu Qinxiang looked to Zhu Jian. He apologized, “I’m so sorry for what my daughter has done. It’s my fault. I failed to teach her well as her parent. I’ll take her away right now”

The school had made the decision. Gu Qinxiang felt too ashamed to beg Zhu Jian to let Gu Xiaoxiao stay, but he was also curious about the reason why Gu Xiaoxiao wanted to ruin that female student.

Thus he asked, “May I know what conflict my daughter has had with that student?”

“Gu Xiaoxiao has humiliated the student named Gu Ning and her mother, so Gu Ning slapped Gu Xiaoxiao,” Zhu Jian said.

“Gu Ning?”

Hearing that, Gu Qinxiang wore a displeased face with a mixed emotions. However, he couldn’t blame Gu Ning now.

He disliked Gu Ning, but he only treated her like she was an outsider. He wanted to maintain a distance away from her, but he never had the thought to hurt them.

Gu Qinxiang left with Gu Xiaoxiao later. They didn’t even take the books in the classroom with them. On the way, Gu Qinxiang discovered Gu Xiaoxiao’s cheeks were red and swollen. He felt regretful.

Although he had slapped Gu Xiaoxiao in anger just then, he wouldn’t allow others to slap his daughter.
