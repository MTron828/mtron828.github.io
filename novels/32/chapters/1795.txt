Chapter 1797: Specifically Mention a Student

When they shared a meal yesterday, Gu Ning had already exchanged phone numbers with Song Miaoge, which meant she took Song Miaoge as her friend, but they were just common friends for the time being.

It was nearly 9 am after Gu Ning arrived at the No.1 multimedia room and many students were already present.

Watching so many students in the room, Gu Ning was impressed. She believed that students who majored in economics must be divided into many classes.

She walked in. Because there were many students chatting with each other, only a few noticed her coming inside. In addition, Gu Ning also planned to keep a low profile, so she lowered her head on purpose.

Some people who were close to her still saw her, but not everyone had heard of Gu Ning’s name. Even if some had heard about her, not everyone could recognize her. They were mainly amazed by her outstanding appearance.

Gu Ning found a seat which wasn’t so noticeable and sat down.

Once she seated herself, a male student tried to strike up a conversation with her. “Hi, may I know your name? Which class are you from?”

“My name’s Gu Ning. I’m from Class A,” said Gu Ning politely.

“Gu Ning? Are you the...” The male student rounded his eyes in shock with excitement. It was obvious that he had heard of her.

“Sh!” Before the male student could finish, Gu Ning immediately gestured for him to shut his mouth. She was unwilling to be surrounded and watched by people again as if she was a monkey in the zoo.

The male student closed his mouth at once. Luckily, it was a little noisy in the multimedia room, so not many people heard his exclaimation.

Several students who were paying special attention to Gu Ning realized who she was after she introduced herself. They got excited and surprised too, but they also kept their voices down.

Since Gu Ning was reluctant to attract more attention, they said nothing.

“Um, please keep it among us,” Gu Ning said and showed an expression that she had no intention of causing a scene, so other people nodded.

Gu Ning was so famous. If everyone around her knew she was here, it would definitely cause a scene.

Because she walked in the classroom five minutes before the time, all the leaders and teachers of different departments soon came and sat together in the first row.

As they showed up, the noisy multimedia room became quiet.

After that, a teacher and the host went onto the stage and gave a short speech.

In a short while, it was the dean’s turn to give a speech.

The dean was slightly serious and old-school. As a result, many students felt sleepy hearing his speech, but nobody dared to sleep.

It would be super embarrassing if they were caught sleeping in the meeting on the first day before the classes officially began.

Right when everyone felt bored, the dean suddenly said, “Now, I need to specifically mention a student, which is Gu Ning.”

Once Gu Ning heard that the dean was going to specifically mention a student, she had a feeling that it was her. It turned out that she was right.

Several students sitting around Gu Ning turned to stare at her without delay. Because they knew the dean specifically mentioned her in order to compliment her in public, they looked at her with admiration.

Those who had heard of Gu Ning also knew the dean was going to praise her, so they looked around searching for her.

Since the dean mentioned Gu Ning, Gu Ning must be a student of their department.

However, only a few could recognize Gu Ning and they kept quiet. They only gave her more glances, because they were at a meeting now.

There were students who admired Gu Ning and took her as their idol, while there were also some students who were jealous of her and hated her.

Not everyone would admire her because she was outstanding. Some people were very mean and unkind. They would be jealous of others who could get or do what they couldn’t.

At the same time, some students had never heard of Gu Ning, so they didn’t understand why the dean needed to specifically mention her. Before long, they figured out the reason.

When the dean talked about Gu Ning, his serious face became gentle with happiness that couldn’t be hidden.

Their university had competed against all the other prestigious universities in their country for Gu Ning, who was an unbelievable genius, and finally she chose their university and their department, so he felt extremely happy for that.

Their principal had also told him not to limit Gu Ning’s behavior as long as she could finish her college education. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I bet many of you must have heard of Gu Ning, right? She’s the first top scorer with a full score in history ever since our country has been founded. All the prestigious universities in our country have competed against each other for her, but Gu Ning chose our school, and we all feel proud of that.”

Knowing that, all the students who had never heard about Gu Ning were shocked. To their astonishment, Gu Ning was accepted with a full score.

In that case, she was really the first top scorer with a full score in the history!

Who is Gu Ning? They got curious.

More and more people began to look around, but they failed to find her because many of them didn’t know her.

“Who is Gu Ning? She’s quite unbelievable. I can’t believe she’s the top scorer with a full score!”

“Right, she must have made the news, but I didn’t pay much attention to the news recently. I know nothing about it.”

“...”

They discussed it with curiosity, but the dean told them to be quiet.

The dean continued, “Actually, Gu Ning has achieved more than just that. At a very young age, she’s already the founder of Jade Beauty Jewelry, Fenghua Entertainment, Kouzi, Colaine, Charm, and Xiangyun Antique-store. All the above companies hold an important position in their industries, and they’re developing fast. I hope every one of you can learn from Gu Ning.”

Hearing that, those who were unaware of Gu Ning’s achievements were shocked at this moment. They couldn’t believe their ears.

All the above companies turned out to be owned by Gu Ning.

“Did I hear it right? Those companies are all owned by Gu Ning?”

“Jesus, she’s amazing! I can’t believe she’s able to build so many profitable companies at the same age as me. Several of them are quite famous too.”

“...”

By now, Jade Beauty Jewelry, Fenghua Entertainment, Kouzi, Colaine, and Charm had gained a lot of fame.

In addition, the majority of the students had read news about Fenghua Entertainment, Kouzi, and Colaine.
