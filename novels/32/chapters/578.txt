Chapter 579 Chase Away from the Tang Family

Gu Man found it unbelievable and scary after hearing Gu Ning’s explanation. She nodded and agreed, but didn’t say another word.

In the Tang family’s house at this moment.

Xin Zi had struggled the entire night, but decided to confess to everything that he had done in the end, so he followed Qiao Dong to see Tang Haifeng after breakfast.

Tang Yunhang and his wife were at work, while Tang Yunfan was pretending that he was still unconscious in his bedroom, so only Tang Haifeng was in the house now.

Qiao Dong told Xin Zi to wait outside for a while and he went inside first. “Master Tang, Xin Zi has something to tell you.”

“Tell him to come in,” Tang Haifeng said, and didn’t think further.

Afterwards, Qiao Dong brought Xin Zi walking inside.

Xin Zi came to Tang Haifeng with his body trembling in fear and guilt then knelt down to the ground with a loud sound, which surprised Tang Haifeng.

“Master Tang, I’m so sorry. It was me who leaked the news that Lord Tang has been unconscious and Lord Tang’s relationship with Miss Gu,” Xin Zi apologized, but also explained. “I was forced to do so. If I didn’t listen to them, they would kill my son.”

Hearing that, Tang Haifeng was shocked, then got furious before he calmed down when he heard Xin Zi’s last sentence. As a father, Tang Haifeng understood why Xin Zi did it. However, Xin Zi made a terrible mistake and betrayed the Tang family.

Qiao Dong didn’t know that Xin Zi had also leaked Tang Yunfan’s relationship with Gu Ning and Gu Man until now. In that case, Gu Man’s abduction was all because of the Tang

family.

Although Tang Yunfan and Gu Ning’s connection was still kept a secret, all the domestic servants in the Tang family knew that Gu Ning couldn’t be a simple girl.

If Gu Man and Gu Ning were Tang Yunfan’s wife and daughter, Gu Man abduction must have been a scheme against the Tang family.

“Tell me, who threatened you to do it?” Tang Haifeng questioned Xin Zi. Although he believed that the person had to be Tang Deming, he still needed to hear the answer from Xin Zi’s mouth.

Xin Zi felt very guilty and said, “I-I don’t know. I only know the person’s phone number. I even have no idea whether it’s a he or a she, because the person used a voice changer on the phone.”

Hearing that, both Tang Haifeng and Qiao Dong frowned. It didn’t seem like Xin Zi was lying.

“The person sent me a photo of my son in the school and threatened me to help him, or my son would be killed,” Xin Zi added. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Give me the person’s phone number,” Tang Haifeng said.

“Sure.” Xin Zi immediately took out his phone, and Tang Haifeng told Qiao Dong to find the information of the ID card behind the number.

“Although you’ve betrayed us under another person’s threat, you’ve made an unforgivable mistake,” Tang Haifeng said.

Xin Zi didn’t beg for forgiveness because he knew that it was unforgivable.

Tang Haifeng planned to punish Xin Zi in the beginning, but gave up upon realizing that Xin Zi did it all because of his son. “Alright, get out of the Tang family’s house now. If you don’t want your son to be in danger again, leave City B.”

In Qiao Guanxiang’s apartment..

Qiao Guanxiang was sleeping on the sofa like a rat in water. He looked tired and haggard with messy hair and empty eyes. There was stubble around his mouth and his body was soaked in the smell of alcohol. There were also beer bottles on the table in front of the sofa.

It had been three days, but he still couldn’t find Xia Yichu. Xia Yichu’s old phone number was also canceled, so he was in despair now and was drowning in alcohol.

At that moment, Pei Hena got back. She was also in a bad mood and condition after Xia Yichu had disappeared. When she saw that Qiao Guanxiang was drunk again, she was annoyed at once. “Qiao Guanxiang, don’t you know that we’re about to be doomed? Why are you still drinking here?”

“What else can I do except drink? I can’t find Xia Yichu, nor get through to her,” Qiao Guanxiang shouted in anger.

“Xia Yichu is such a bitch! i’ll pay her back when I catch her!” Pei Hena also shouted to vent her anger. Interestingly enough both of them were doomed, but Pei Hena still wanted to pay Xia Yichu back.

Before long, Qiao Guanxiang’s phone rang and he picked it up.

The caller was a business party and asked whether Pei Hena was free in a week’s time. They wanted to invite her to sing at an event and asked for a live sound. Live sound meant that she had to sing live. Sound reproduction meant that they would play the recorded song, and the singer would lip-synch. In many events, the host would use sound reproduction for a better effect, and only asked for a live sound when the singer needed to interact with the audience.

However, Xia Yichu had already left them, and Qiao Guanxiang didn’t dare to accept the offer, because Xia Yichu could expose their dirty secret at any moment. That being the case, Qiao Guanxiang lied that Pei Hena accidentally hurt her foot, and that she had to rest for a month.

Hearing Qiao Guanxiang’s reply, Pei Hena was upset, but she knew that she didn’t have the ability to sing live, on stage in front of cameras. What was worse, they couldn’t lie forever.

In the capital, Xia Yichu had found a nice apartment after she had signed the contract, and she went to do a check up on her injury in the hospital later. After that, Xia Yichu began to use the medicine that Gu Ning had given her. When the potion was applied on her scar, she felt quite comfortable and the nasty scar started to fade, which surprised her.

“Wow!” Xia Yidong saw it fading with his own eyes, and couldn’t believe that it was real.

“It’s real. It’s real!” Xia Yichu cried in excitement. She could finally get rid of the scar, and regain her beautiful face.

“This is so amazing!” Xia Yidong was even more excited than Xia Yichu, because his older sister was his only family member.

Xia Yichu applied the potion on her scar in the following days, and the scar disappeared after three days.
