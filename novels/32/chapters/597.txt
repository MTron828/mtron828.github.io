Chapter 598 Shao Feifei Is Doomed

“Yes,” Gu Ning answered.

Hearing that, Zhou Zhenghong was shocked by Gu Ning’s wealth once more.

Without further questioning, Zhou Zhenghong put the suitcases into the trunk, then got in the luxurious car.

“I’ll send you to the hotel first and you can have a rest today. I need you to go to our branch to get familiar with the staff and prepare for the opening ceremony tomorrow,” Gu Ning said.

Although the branch hadn’t opened yet, the staff were ready.

“No problem,” Zhou Zhenghong said.

In City F.

When it was 6 pm, the last class was over and all the students went to the canteen.

However, Chu Peihan suddenly appeared in front of Shao Feifei on the way and slapped her across her face a few times.

Seeing the scene, students around them were scared and ran away, including Wu Qingya and Yang Yulu who claimed to be Shao Feifei’s best friends.

It wasn’t uncommon that Chu Peihan publicly fought with others in their school, so she didn’t hesitate to beat Shao Feifei this time.

Although onlookers were confused about the reason why Chu Peihan beat Shao Feifei all of a sudden, they knew that Chu Peihan did it for a reason.

“Shao Feifei, how dare you slander Gu Ning!”

Hearing that, everyone was surprised. What? Shao Feifei slandered Gu Ning?

“Don’t think that you can get away with it with your insincere apologies. You must pay for what you’ve done!” Chu Peihan said while she kept beating and kicking Shao Feifei. However, nobody came forward to stop her. They were afraid of Chu Peihan and they were also mad at Shao Feifei because she was the one who had slandered Gu Ning on the Internet, so it was impossible that any of them were willing to help Shao Feifei.

“Why are you so sure that it’s Feifei who slandered Gu Ning?” Yang Chengjun arrived at this moment, and questioned Chu Peihan, but he didn’t walk forward to protect Shao Feifei, because he was afraid of Chu Peihan too.

“Why?” Chu Peihan sneered. “Do you want me to reveal the evidence? The best way to keep your dirty secrets is not to do bad deeds. You should know that there is a group of people called hackers in this world, right? As long as you use your phone or computer to post something on the Internet, it’s easy for them to track you down using your IP address.”

Hearing that, everyone was shocked. Luckily, they didn’t spread fake news on the Internet.

Yang Chengjun also shut his mouth now.

Chu Peihan knew that she couldn’t beat Shao Feifei to death, so she seriously injured her before she walked away.

Once Chu Peihan was gone, Wu Qingya and Yang Yulu called the ambulance and their teacher.

When Zhang Qiuhua arrived and got to know the reason, she was shocked by what Shao Feifei had done, but she also thought that Chu Peihan shouldn’t have beaten Shao Feifei like that in public, and she had to report this to the Academic Affairs office.

Nevertheless, Shao Feifei had to be sent to the hospital right away.

When Shao Feifei’s parents heard about it, they were furious. Although they knew that it was their daughter’s fault in the first place, they still thought that it wasn’t a big deal, and blamed Chu Peihan for everything. Therefore, they decided to defend their daughter in the school the next day.

At the same time, Gu Ning drove Zhou Zhenghong to the Huangdeng Hotel and booked two rooms. One was for Zhou Zhenghong, while the other was for Su Tongnuo and her assistant.

Afterwards, she arranged for an exclusive car from the hotel to be responsible for their following commutes.

As for jade jewelry, Gu Ning would take care of it because Gu Ning was a kung fu master, and jade jewelry would be safer with her than with Zhou Zhenghong.

When Gu Ning left, she put the two suitcases into her telepathic eye space.

After that, she went back to the Tang family’s house.

On the way, Gu Ning received Su Tongnuo’s call, and Su Tongnuo told her that she was already in City B.

Gu Ning told her to have a good rest tonight and that they would start to work tomorrow.

When Gu Ning arrived at the Tang family’s house, they were enjoying their dinner, so Gu Ning directly joined them.

“Ningning, I heard that your jewelry store is about to open? I have a party tomorrow and I can wear your jewelry to help you promote it,” Jiang Lihua said with anticipation.

“That’s a good idea. Thanks!” Gu Ning said.

“Well, we’re a family, you don’t need to thank me,” Jiang Lihua said.

“Sure,” Gu Ning said with a smile.

“Good girl!” Jiang Lihua was satisfied.

After dinner, Gu Ning told Tang Yunfan that she had encountered Feng Xueqin in private and that she wasn’t willing to see Gu Man being hurt by another woman because of him.

Tang Yunfan promised that he would never allow anyone to hurt Gu Man, and he would arrange more people to keep a close eye on Feng Xueqin. He also told Gu Ning not to tell Gu Man about Feng Xueqin, in case Gu Man would be upset.

Gu Ning agreed without hesitation.

When Gu Ning and Gu Man went back to Gu Ning’s house, Gu Man went to bed, but Gu Ning took out ten sets of jade jewelry that they were going to shoot tomorrow and put them into a small safe.

After that, she put the safe into her telepathic eye space.

The next day, Gu Ning drove Gu Man to the Tang family’s house as usual, then took out the safe from her telepathic eye space and put it on the front passenger’s seat before she went to pick Yu Zi up at the shopping

mall.

After Yu Zi, along with the gowns, got in her car, she called Su Tongnuo and told her to meet at the appointed place. Gu Ning and the others were going to the photo studio of the entertainment company under the name of the Tanghuang Group.

Because the hotel wasn’t far from the shopping mall, Su Tongnuo and Gu Ning arrived there at almost the same time.

Although Su Tongnuo wasn’t very famous now, she still put on a baseball cap and a mask.

Once Su Tongnuo got out of the car, she walked to Gu Ning and greeted her with great respect.

“Let me introduce you. Tongnuo, this is Yu Zi, the designer of Charm. Yu Zi, this is Su Tongnuo, the spokesperson of the jewelry brand,” Gu Ning introduced them to each other.

“Nice to meet you!”

“Nice to meet you too!”

The two greeted one another politely.

It was the first time that Yu Zi had seen an actress in person, so she was a little nervous and quite excited. She had dreamed that her designs could be worn by celebrities, but she never believed that it would come true so soon.

When Su Tongnuo noticed the safe in Gu Ning’s hand, she said, “I’ve never seen a boss like you who does everything in person.”

“Sometimes it’s not a bad thing to do some things in person,” Gu Ning said with a smile. “I’m the boss after all and I need to know how my company works.”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
