Therefore, even if Nicholas made himself invisible, he still failed to hurt the woman. On the contrary, he was injured by the woman.

This time, Nicholas was extremely mad and became anxious.

This woman was so strong! He didn’t expect to encounter such a strong person here. She could easily get rid of his evil force and his invisibility was of no use before her.

Given the current situation, he realized that all of his skills were useless in his fight against the woman, so he had to play his trump card.

It was the soul in his crystal ball.

Without delay, Nicholas took out the crystal ball and let the soul out.

The woman didn’t know what Nicholas was doing, so she didn’t stop him from doing that.

Gu Ning was aware, but she didn’t bother to stop Nicholas.

She wasn’t deliberately putting the woman in danger, but she thought it was better to deal with the soul as well since they targeted Nicholas. After all, the soul was harmful.

If they didn’t give Nicholas the chance to let the soul out, they wouldn’t be able to catch the soul even if they could get the crystal ball later.

All of a sudden, Ma Shibiao and his subordinates saw a person, or a strange creature to be specific, appear out of nowhere. They were all stunned. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Was this a ghost?

Although the woman turned out not to be a ghost, they were almost convinced that ghosts really existed after what had just happened to them. As a result, looking at the soul which showed up suddenly and didn’t have the appearance of a human, they believed that it should be a monster or a ghost.

To Ma Shibiao’s astonishment, Nicholas kept such a strange thing with him.

The soul was full of resentment, because it was completely covered in black gas, which also meant it was very strong and aggressive.

Once the soul joined the fight, it became a little difficult for the woman to defeat Nicholas.

This time, Gu Ning couldn’t stand on the sidelines. With a leap, she went to help the woman.

Gu Ning directly fought against the soul.

Gu Ning wasn’t at a high level, but she had the help of her magical power, so the magical energy she released wasn’t weak. It was even stronger than the woman’s magical energy, and could easily fight back the soul’s evil force.

Witnessing that, the woman was shocked.

This girl was indeed very strong!

Compared with Nicholas, the soul was much more resistant. When Gu Ning hit it with her magical energy, it only shook a little and wasn’t injured at all. If it hit Nicholas, he would surely be injured although not seriously.

Nicholas was a sorcerer, but he relied on his wand and crystal ball for strength. He wasn’t actually stronger than ordinary people. After living with evil forces for a long time, he looked evil too.

Nicholas was good at fighting, but it had nothing to do with his wand and crystal ball. He practiced the skills on his own.

There were wizards who weren’t good at fighting or could barely fight. After all, magical skills had nothing to do with kung fu.

The soul was very strong, so even Gu Ning couldn’t control it within a short time.

Without the soul’s help, Nicholas was soon at a disadvantage again. It was hard for him to win, so he became anxious.

However, no matter how anxious he was, it was useless. Seeing that the soul couldn’t defeat Gu Ning, he realized that he was doomed this time. However, Nicholas refused to admit it, unless he was caught. He still did his best to fight against the woman.

As time went by, Nicholas was out of strength, and was knocked away by the woman’s magical energy, then knocked himself against the other coffin.

The woman was scared and immediately ran over. “No!”

The man lying in the other coffin was the woman’s senior. They had the same master.

After the coffin was knocked over by Nicholas, the man lying inside rolled out onto the ground and was pressed down by the heavy coffin.

The woman went over and easily moved the coffin with a simple wave of her hand. Afterwards, she supported the man and removed the Taoist talisman on his chest.

Once the Taoist talisman was removed, the man opened his eyes. He was still a little confused and it took him some time to get back to his senses.

After a few seconds, the man saw the woman and looked very surprised. “No way…”

“Yeah, it’s me!” The woman was thrilled when the man woke up, and she almost cried in joy.

They finally saw each other again, and could be together again.

Although she felt that she had only slept, she felt many years had passed after she woke up.

“Oh, it’s you!” The man was also very happy to see the woman. Without hesitation, he pulled her into his arms and hugged her tight.

Nicholas was injured by the woman’s punch, but he could still move and walk around.

Seeing that the woman was happily chatting with the man, Nicholas seized the chance and lifted his wand to attack the woman. Unfortunately, the moment he moved, Gu Ning saw him and directly took out a gun to shoot at Nicholas.

Bang! The loud gunshot scared the woman and the man. Nicholas was shot in the arm and his wand fell to the ground. It was impossible for him to continue to attack the woman.

Although the woman and the man didn’t know it was a gun, they saw Nicholas injured by it, so they believed that it was a hidden weapon. However, it was too loud, so it wasn’t good. Once it fired, all of their enemies would be alerted.

They knew very little about guns.

“I understand that you’re super excited to see each other, but it’s obviously not the right time to tell each other how much you miss one another now. Why don’t you do that later?” Gu Ning said. She wasn’t blaming them, because she felt for them. Therefore, she spoke in a resigned tone.

The woman and the man were embarrassed. It was indeed their fault.

After the man woke up, he was curious about what had happened.

How did they get into their place? Who was this girl?

He knew that Gu Ning was a cultivator, but why did she come here?

The woman could see that the man was curious about it, so she said, “Let’s deal with the man and the soul first. I’ll tell you the whole story in a while..”
