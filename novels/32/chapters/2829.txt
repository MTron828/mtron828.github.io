Chapter 2830: It Could Just Be an Accident

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

At the moment that the monster wolf was killed, it was reluctant to leave this world, because it still hoped that Leng Shaoting would let it go.

If it were a human or a cultivator, Leng Shaoting couldn’t kill him randomly, because it would affect his luck, but since it was a monster, he could gain good luck by killing it.

Afterwards, Leng Shaoting picked Xiao Nanchen up and walked back.

From a distance, Gu Ning, Xu Jinchen, and the others saw Leng Shaoting carrying Xu Jinchen while walking back, so they immediately went forward to welcome them.

By that time, Xiao Nanchen had gotten rid of the monster, which meant that Leng Shaoting had killed it, but Xu Jinchen and the others didn’t know that, so they asked worriedly, “Boss, how’s Nanchen now?”

“He’s fine. He’ll be normal after resting for a few days,” said Leng Shaoting. Although Xiao Nanchen was still weak now, Gu Ning could help him regain his energy again.

“Let me carry him,” Chen Meng said, asking Leng Shaoting to put Xiao Nanchen on his back. He thought Leng Shaoting would be tired after helping Xiao Nanchen get rid of the strange creature.

“It’s fine. I can do it.” Leng Shaoting declined, because it didn’t take much strength to kill the monster wolf.

After that, they went to Xiao Nanchen’s dormitory room.

Back in the room, Leng Shaoting told the others to go out. Only Gu Ning and he would stay.

Once everyone left, Leng Shaoting asked Gu Ning to insert magical power into Xiao Nanchen’s body.

Normally, Leng Shaoting didn’t want Gu Ning to touch other men, but it was a matter of life. He shouldn’t think much about it. Anyway, the man was a close brother who had been through a lot of danger with him.

Once Xu Jinchen and the others were out, Gu Ning placed her hand on Xiao Nanchen’s forehead to insert magical power into him.

It was faster to put magical power into his body by touching his skin rather than through the air. And it could also reduce the amount of magical power used.

If the magical power was put into one’s body through air, it would decrease during the process. Therefore, Gu Ning needed to release a third more magical power to make sure that it was enough.

Given Xiao Nanchen’s current condition, his life was still in danger, so he needed a lot of magical power. Without Gu Ning’s help, Xiao Nanchen would probably lose his life.

Leng Shaoting could also rescue him, but his magical power wasn’t pure, so it wouldn’t be able to completely cure Xiao Nanchen. Xiao Nanchen would only survive and recover a small amount.

On the other hand, if Gu Ning helped Xiao Nanchen, Xiao Nanchen would make a full recovery.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have bothered Gu Ning. He would just have done it on his own.

After the magical power went into Xiao Nanchen’s body, his face gradually became ruddy. The power crystal he had taken helped keep him alive, but it wasn’t enough to deal with his injuries.

Xiao Nanchen didn’t go back to normal until he absorbed magical power for about ten minutes. He woke up afterwards so Gu Ning stopped.

Given Gu Ning’s level now, she wouldn’t be affected too much. Her face was just a little pale, but she would be fine after resting for a while.

Leng Shaoting immediately supported Gu Ning to have a seat before checking on Xiao Nanchen’s condition.

Xiao Nanchen had just woken up and wasn’t fully conscious yet. He didn’t know what had happened until he heard Leng Shaoting’s voice.

“How do you feel now?” asked Leng Shaoting.

Abruptly, Xiao Nanchen sat up on the bed, looking horrified, but his fear went away after he recognized Leng Shaoting.

“I just ran into a wolf in the yard. The wolf ran towards me. I was unable to avoid it, so I was knocked down,” said Xiao Nanchen. Because he didn’t have any memory after being possessed, he thought that he had passed out for a while.

Leng Shaoting had no intention of keeping the truth from Xiao Nanchen, because it had caused a scene in the military base. It was impossible to keep it a secret. And Xiao Nanchen had injured many people. He should make an apology.

Although he was possessed by the monster wolf and became violent, those injured people were innocent.

Therefore, Leng Shaoting said, “You were possessed by a monster wolf earlier. You made a mess in the military base and injured many people.”

“What?”

Hearing that, Xiao Nanchen was shocked. He was possessed by a monster wolf, made a mess in the military base, and even injured many people?

He didn’t doubt Leng Shaoting’s words, but he couldn’t remember it at all. It was too scary.

“D-Did I cause serious trouble?” Xiao Nanchen’s voice was trembling. It wasn’t his intention to injure people, but he did, so he felt very guilty.

“Don’t worry, they’re fine. You just need to make an apology,” said Gu Ning. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Hearing that, Xiao Nanchen was relieved, then he sincerely thanked them. “Thank you, Shaoting, and Miss Gu.”

“No need to say that. We’re brothers,” said Leng Shaoting. They were too close to thank each other for favors.

Afterwards, Leng Shaoting went to open the door and told the others to come in.

They were all relieved when they saw that Xiao Nanchen was awake.

Gu Ning rarely came to the military base that Leng Shaoting stayed in. She often rushed here to deal with things, then hurriedly left. So this time, they decided to have dinner before going back, so Leng Shaoting took Gu Ning out for a walk.

Due to the accident, the soldiers didn’t train today, but had half a day off.

When Leng Shaoting went to catch the monster wolf, Xu Jinchen had already reminded them to keep it a secret.

Xiao Nanchen was fine now, so he apologized to everyone.

He was an officer, while they were soldiers, but he still needed to make an apology.

After all, when they weren’t in the army, they were equal. Whether he apologized or not depended on his quality not his status.

Even though people didn’t know why Xiao Nanchen suddenly became so violent, they understood that he didn’t mean to hurt anyone. Therefore, no one blamed him, but they still felt touched by his apology.

“Tell me about the monster wolf,” Gu Ning asked Leng Shaoting when no one was around.

Then Leng Shaoting told Gu Ning everything about the monster wolf.

“I think it was probably just a coincidence,” said Gu Ning. She had also wondered whether it was a scheme, but now it seemed unlikely.
