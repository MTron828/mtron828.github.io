Chapter 526 Feel Happy Being Cared by Gu Ning

Gu Man took out two boxes the size of a book, giving them to Gu Yinyin and Gu Qingshi. “These are the gifts from me and your Aunt Qing for you. You can open it now to see whether you like it.”

The gifts were two tablets. Gu Yinyin’s and Gu Qingshi’s eyes lit up at once when they saw the brand logo. However, they didn’t dare to take the gifts right away but looked at Gu Qinyang with anticipation. They had to ask for their father’s agreement.

“Man, Qing, you don’t need to buy such expensive gifts for them!” Gu Qinyang felt embarrassed, because he knew that the tablets were very expensive.

“It’s no big deal. Children today all love this brand of tablet,” Gu Man said airily. She wasn’t showing off her wealth, she just knew that they would like it.

Gu Qinyang also understood that Gu Qing and Gu Man were just being nice to them.

Since they said so, Gu Qinyang didn’t insist. “Alright, take your gifts and thank your two aunts!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Hearing that, Gu Yinyin and Gu Qingshi were excited and thanked Gu Man and Gu Qing. “Thank you so much, Aunt Man, Aunt Qing!”

“You’re welcome!” Gu Qing and Gu Man said.

After that, Gu Qinyang went to pour glasses of water for them.

Before long, Wen Yulan was back with many vegetables and seafood.

“Yulan, you’ve bought so much!”

“Can we finish all of it?” Gu Qing and Gu Man said.

“Oh, don’t worry. We can do our best to eat it all!” Wen Yulan said.

It was already past 6 pm, so Gu Qing and Gu Man helped Wen Yulan cook, because it would be faster.

Gu Ning, Leng Shaoting and Gu Qinyang, meanwhile, were chatting randomly in the living room, while Gu Yinyin and Gu Qingshi were studying their new gifts.

Gu Qinyang asked Leng Shaoting some questions, like where he came from, where he worked and so on.

Leng Shaoting told him that he was an army officer, working in the general military region in the capital. As for his position in the army, Leng Shaoting didn’t tell him. Gu Qinyang didn’t ask him either, because he believed that Leng Shaoting was merely a normal army officer at such a young age.

However, Gu Qinyang did think highly of Leng Shaoting once he found out about Leng Shaoting’s job because most people held great respect and admiration towards soldiers.

After a while, the people in the living room smelt the aroma of food. With her acute sense of smell, Gu Ning smelled the scent of seafood and subconsciously looked at Leng Shaoting. Leng Shaoting frowned a little at this time.

Gu Ning immediately stood up walking into the kitchen. When she saw all the seafood on the counter, Gu Ning was greatly surprised.

It was true that she loved seafood but Leng Shaoting was allergic to it!

“Do we have other food except seafood? Shaoting is allergic to it,” Gu Ning asked.

Hearing that, those in the kitchen stopped what they were doing for a moment. Wen Yulan hadn’t known that Leng Shaoting was allergic to seafood. Luckily, she also bought many vegetables and other meat. “Oh, don’t worry. We have other food.”

Hearing that, Gu Ning relaxed.

Seeing Gu Ning’s back, Leng Shaoting felt very happy that she cared about him.

When Gu Ning turned around, she saw the gentle smile on Leng Shaoting’s lips and her heart skipped a beat all of a sudden. She took a long breath in at once to calm herself down.

Was it because Leng Shaoting was too charming, or was it because she couldn’t resist his charm? She was easily seduced by his slight smile.

Seeing Gu Ning’s reaction, Leng Shaoting felt more satisfied and pleased. He loved to see Gu Ning’s flushed face.

Gu Ning, however, didn’t dare to look at Leng Shaoting anymore, because she was afraid that she would lose her manners.

Around 7:30 pm, the dinner was ready.

Gu Qinyang wanted to drink some alcohol with Leng Shaoting but Leng Shaoting was going to drive, so he gave up.

During the meal, Gu Qing and Gu Man kept putting all kinds of dishes into Leng Shaoting’s bowl like what they had done the last time.

Gu Ning suddenly felt strange seeing that her mother and aunt were doing that for Leng Shaoting but ignored her.

Gu Qinyang and Wen Yulan, on the other hand, didn’t understand why Gu Qing and Gu Man kept putting dishes into Leng Shaoting’s bowl, but they didn’t ask.

Wen Yulan would have believed that Leng Shaoting was Gu Ning’s boyfriend if Gu Qing and Gu Man hadn’t told her that Leng Shaoting was just Gu Ning’s friend.

In Wen Yulan’s eyes, Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning matched each other very well. Gu Ning was a successful businesswoman now, and it was quite understandable that she socialize a lot to make friends with different kinds of people. It was very helpful for her business after all.

After dinner, it was 8:30 pm, and they had a rest in the living room.

At that moment, Gu Ning took out her gifts for Gu Qinyang and Wen Yulan. “Uncle and aunt, these are gifts for you. Please take them.”

“What? Why did you prepare gifts for us? You’re the younger generation and we should be sending a gift to you!”

“Exactly!”

Both Gu Qinyang and Wen Yulan were surprised.

“It’s fine, and I’ve also prepared gifts for Aunt Qing and Uncle Xu, so please take them.” Gu Ning directly put the gifts into their hands.

“Well...” They hesitated to take the gifts.

“Please take them. Ningning is just being kind and we all have gifts from her,” Gu Qing said.

“Indeed! Please take them,” Gu Man added.

“Ningning, thank you so much!” Gu Qinyang and Wen Yulan said.

Nobody was unhappy to receive gifts.

When Gu Qinyang and Wen Yulan took Gu Ning’s gifts, they opened the boxes to see what was inside.

“This is...” Gu Qinyang was shocked when he saw the jade pixiu the size of a fist in his box.

He knew that Gu Ning did jade business, so this pixiu had to be real. Although he didn’t know much about jade, and couldn’t recognize its type, he had heard that a jade pixiu was very expensive. And this one could be worth over a million yuan.

Gu Qinyang understood that Gu Ning wouldn’t send cheap gifts but he didn’t expect that it would be so valuable.

Wen Yulan opened her box, and her face lit up at once when she saw the set of jade jewelry in it.
