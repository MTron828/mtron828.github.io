916 Let the Evil Jiao Ou

Gu Ning had her magical power to protect her, so she was able to stay safe and healthy.

In case anything else attacked her lower body again, Gu Ning decided not to float on the surface of the water any longer, and swam ahead. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

About 20 meters ahead, the passage became wider, and she finally arrived at the bottom of the hole.

Once Gu Ning left the water, a group of bats flew around and made a lot of noise. Gu Ning took out her night-luminescent pearl at once to chase them away with its bright light.

It would be difficult to get the treasure. There were countless bats trapped inside, because they couldn’t fly outside.

Gu Ning finally clearly saw the ship in front of her. She hadn’t noticed that there was a flag with two bones crossing each other and a skull in the middle on it until now. In an instant, Gu Ning realized that this ship was a pirate ship.

In other words, This island was once the place where pirates lived.

Since this was a pirate ship, there must be many valuable things on it.

Because the ship has been parked here for too long, and the wood had decayed in a large area. Gu Ning wasn’t sure whether it would collapse if she directly stepped on it. If it collapsed, those valuable objects would fall into the water, and some might be destroyed.

Besides, the boat was a little tall, and she was floating in the water, so she couldn’t reach it at all. Fortunately, this cavern was large, and the water next to it could accommodate her yacht.

Gu Ning now realized that she should have taken out her yacht once she got into this passage.

Without further ado, she got on the yacht and began to observe the pirate ship. She needed to know whether she could step on it and how many things she could take away.

It turned out that there were more valuable things on this pirate ship than the sunken ship that Gu Ning had been to before. Most importantly, they were still in good condition.

Gold, silver, jewels, pottery, porcelain, books, paintings, clothing, ancient coins, and everything was all in a mess. These things added up to a dozen boxes, and most of them were gold, silver and jewelry, because they were the currency for general trading back then.

An idea dawned on Gu Ning. She could open a private museum with all of the real antiques she had found till now. It wasn’t a bad idea in Gu Ning’s eyes, and she could also sell tickets to visitors.

She used to think that she could sell the most valuable bronze bells at auction, but now she felt that it would be more attractive if she placed them in a private museum. However, it wasn’t easy to open a private museum, because grave-digging was illegal.

Although Leng Shaoting could help her with it, she was still worried that it would cause him trouble.

She planned to ask him when she got back later.

After observation, Gu Ning found that the bottom of the ship had decayed because it had been immersed in water for so many years, but a large portion of the wooden boards which weren’t soaked in water were still fine.

Gu Ning thought that it wouldn’t collapse if she was very careful when she stepped on it.

After that, Gu Ning directly crossed over the gap between her yacht and the pirate ship. The gap wasn’t wide, it was only about 30 centimeters. So it was easy for Gu Ning to cross it.

Gu Ning moved lightly and slowly. She took all the boxes into her telepathic eye space before she left.

All of a sudden, Gu Ning remembered the male ghost and the evil jiao in her telepathic eye space. She thought that she could have a talk with them right here.

This place was isolated from the outside. Even if they got mad, they wouldn’t cause trouble for innocent people.

Thinking of that, Gu Ning put her yacht away, and swam to the passage at the other side. It led to the ground, not the ocean.

After climbing ashore, Gu Ning walked in for about ten meters before she let the evil jiao out. If it escaped, it would cause big trouble.

When the evil jiao found that it wasn’t at the bottom of the sea, it was shocked. It was also surprised to see Gu Ning in different clothing.

Gu Ning removed her make-up as “Tang Aining” before she dived into the sea, so she looked like she usually did right now.

From the moment the evil jiao entered the telepathic eye space to the moment it came out, its memory was static, but the changes in the scene and Gu Ning’s clothes reminded the evil jiao that something had happened.

“Tell me what has happened? Why am I here? Why is your clothing different?” it asked Gu Ning.

“I put you away and brought you here,” Gu Ning replied.

“What? You put me away?” The evil jiao was shocked.

“Right, I caught your long beard when you were about to eat my night-luminescent pearl,” Gu Ning said.

Hearing that, the evil jiao realized that Gu Ning had trapped him.

“How dare you trap me!” The evil jiao was furious.

“You wanted to eat my night-luminescent pearl first! I’m not dumb enough to wait there for you to eat it,” Gu Ning said.

“You...” The evil jiao lost patience. “Give me the night-luminescent pearl, or I’ll swallow you.”

“Well,” Gu Ning sneered, “to be honest with you, I can put you away again once you touch me.”
