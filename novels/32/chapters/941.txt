942 Situ Ye Is Injured

Guan Bin argued. “Come on, you have a girlfriend now, and always go out on dates with her without thinking of me. Pan Zirui, I’m surprised by your complete change.”

Pan Zirui was a well-known playboy in his friend circle, and he had countless exes. He had even told his friends that he was going to play around forever. If he got married one day, it would have to be because of his parents’ arrangement.

Therefore, when Pan Zirui told them that he had a girlfriend again, they thought that it wouldn’t last long as usual. Even though Pan Zirui told them that he was very serious this time and that he might marry soon, they still believed that he just wanted to fulfill the task his parents assigned him.

No matter how serious Pan Zirui looked, they still had doubts.

They didn’t believe it until they saw the way Pan Zirui treated Jiao Linya with their own eyes.

They were now sure that Pan Zirui took Jiao Linya seriously this time.

“I was young and stupid back then,” Pan Zirui said. “Well, Guan Bin, I think that you should take your future seriously too. You’re not a kid anymore.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Come on, stop educating me,” Guan Bin said. “You know how hard it is to find a girl you really love.”

In fact, both Pan Zirui and Guan Bin had changed every since they met Gu Ning.

Guan Bin just hadn’t played around as often as Pan Zirui, so his change wasn’t as obvious.

...

When Gu Ning just got in her car and was about to start it, she received He Hongjie’s call. He Hongjie told her that his hearing had already recovered and was even better than before.

It was a great surprise for He Hongjie.

A while later, Situ Ye called Gu Ning too.

Gu Ning picked it up at once.

“Hi, Situ,” Gu Ning said. “What’s up?”

“I heard that you have a magical pill and that it can cure any injuries and diseases. Can you sell some to me?” Situ Ye said in a weak voice.

Gu Ning didn’t think that Situ Ye was ill, but it was highly possible that he was injured given his identity.

“Are you injured?” Gu Ning asked.

“Yeah,” Situ Ye said. “I encountered trouble in HK, and was injured during a fight against a weird man.”

Hearing that, Gu Ning suddenly thought of the men from the Evil Practice.

“Where are you right now?” Gu Ning asked again.

“I’m still in the hospital in HK. Although my injuries aren’t serious, it will take at least half a month for me to recover, but I have something else to deal with in a few days,” Situ Ye said anxiously.

“Well, I can help you, but how can I get the medicine to you?” Gu Ning asked. She had no intention to charge Situ Ye for it.

Situ Ye was different from Qi Tianlin, because he was her friend, so she didn’t care about money. In addition, Situ Ye had given her a lot before, so she was willing to give him dozens of power crystals if he needed.

“Are you still in City B?” Situ Ye asked.

“Yes, I am,” Gu Ning said.

“Great, Xuanfeng will come to get the medicine tomorrow,” Situ Ye said. He didn’t want others to know that he was injured.

“No problem,” Gu Ning said. “Oh, I’ve also met a very weird man in HK when I was there. I wonder whether we’ve met the same person.”

“Um, he’s a middle-aged man with slightly gray hair. He stayed aloof and I felt cold once I approached him. He escaped unusually fast, like lightning, which I have never seen before,” Situ Ye said, and still felt anxious thinking of the man.

Hearing that, Gu Ning was sure the man must be a member of the Evil Practice, but she didn’t know whether he was the same man she had encountered last time. She hadn’t clearly seen the man of the Evil Practice last time.

After hanging up the call with Situ Ye, Gu Ning remained silent for a while, then drove to a clubhouse to meet Cao Wenxin.

Cao Wenxin called Gu Ning that afternoon, but Gu Ning was dining with Yu Zi at that time, so Cao Wenxin invited her to gather together in the clubhouse and said that she needed her help.

In the private room, Cao Wenxin, Gao Chengyun, An Ran, Tong Jiayao, Jiang Zezheng and Zhu Yuanzhen were all present, which was a rare scene.

Gu Ning wasn’t familiar with them, but they weren’t strangers either.

Once she showed up, they all welcomed her with enthusiasm.

After cheering for a while, Tong Jiayao walked to Gu Ning and said, “Miss Gu, my mother is a loyal fan of yours, and she always asks me to take some photos with you so that she can show off in front of her friends.”

Tong Jiayao didn’t mind telling Gu Ning her mother’s purpose. Actually, she felt a little embarrassed, because she had just met Gu Ning a few times.
